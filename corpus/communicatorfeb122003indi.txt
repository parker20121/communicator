Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne 



Students rally legislators for increased university funding 



oiganizalion M IPFW and olhcr 
colioees nationwide share in Ihe 
need lor proper funding. 
However. wil&gt;i Ihe current 
economir dive, few colleges are 
able to provide adrauale funding 
to their organizii lions because 
they don't have it themselves.

enrollmenl funding," said 
Director of Alumni Relations 
Jennifer Bosk, "They basically 
give Ihe money to Ihe school thai

loudi?sl or whose legislator asks 
on their behalf. And that's not a 
very fair system." 

On Monday. Feb, 10. nearly 
ISO IFFW students participated 
In the Moosiers for Higher 
Education (HHE) Day at the 
Indiana Slalchouse in doivntown 
Indianapolis. The students

lU Vice President and Chief 
Financial Officer Judy Palmer 
look the stage nekt to break 
down the legislative points. 
Among the points were the goals 
of having our base operating 
fund restored to the level it was 
a! in 2001-2002 (S13,9 million) 
and to receive program funding 
to complete Indiana University's 
new School of Informatics. 
Representative Peggy Welch and 
Assistant Director of lU State 
Relations Kathy Smith completed 
the brieling with addresses. 



Following the HHE briefing, 
students split upfora short period. 
Some slaved in the Westin 
Grand Ballroom !o meet with 
Purdue's Stale Relations 
representative Kevin Green. 
while others traveled a block lo 
Ihe Slate House to call on legislators 
and invite them to join the 
congregation back at the Westin 
for a noon lunch. 

Almost SO tables adorned 
the Westin Ballroom for the 
lunch. White once again 
addressed Ihe staff, students and 
alumni from a variety of Indii 



relating to the funding topic and 
more in-depth topics, 

During this time. White 
also announced Ihat IPFW had 
the largest delegations among all 
of the universities. With lunch 
complete, the students headed

■Accepting your personal responsibility 



; Personal responsibility, II is a concept 
JIhat has been increasingly downplayed and 
pulri^t iniorcd by many in America. In a 
•misguided allempt lo prolecl the self- 
■cstecm and cmolional well-being of every 
!lndividual. society has shifted to a dangerous 
system in which no one is being held 
■ -responsible for Iheir own actions. Irutead, 
wc shift the blame from the individual lo 
someone or something else: their parents, 
their teachers, their dcrgy or sodely In general. 
This is made painfully obvious by 
watching any network ncivs coverage of a 
high profile murder case. The first thing we 
hear about a suspect is what their familv life 
was like. Were tneir parents abusive? were 
they shunned or leased by co-workers or 
students? Did they come Ironf A poor baek- 



wc immediately search for 
something else to place the blame on. 1 
would think that it is already obvious where 
the blame should be placed — on Ihc individual 
who did Ihe killing. 

Don't get me wrong. I absolutely 
believe that family and environmental 
factors do influence the decisions people 
make. This does not absolve Ihem oi 
responsibility for Iheir actions. In Ihe end, 
we have free will lo make decisions for 
ourselves, and ultimately, we as individuals 
should be held accountable for what wc do. 
If a person holds up a gas station and shoots 
Ihcclcrk. who is responsible? Did this person's 
abusive father kilflhe clerk? Of course he 
didn'l. Why then are we so quick lo shift the 
blame from where il belongs? 

For instance, take the tobacco company 
sclllemcnl. The states sued the major tobacco 
producers in this counlry to recover the cost 
of providing health care for smoking-relaled 
ilin esses. I have no problem \vhal5oevcr 
with this aspect of the case (urJess I am talking 
about the culra SI per pack thai I now pay 
lor my cigarettes). What has me deeply 
concerned is that individuals, most of whom 
are yoimg enough to have grown up knoiving 
about all the dangers of smoking, are suing 
the ctcuctle makers for damages due to various 
health problems. Lei's get real here, people. 
That a person still chooses to pick up 



cigarettes and smoke them 
is not the fault of Philhp 
I (and every o the r 
er of r 




„_ ) know that 

cigarettes will ultimately 
lead to death. I feel horrible 
for anyone battling a nicotine 
addiction, but nobody is to 
blame but the person who 
decides to use the product. 
Additionally, there 

lawsuit filed against a fast 

food restaurant claiming 

that their product was responsible for obesity school, a bad grade would cam me a month

Where does the responsibility fall in this sit- school. 







ualion? A hamburger is an inanimate object. 
It will nol jump up from the counter at your 
local eatery and stuff itself sown your 
throat, A hamburger will only cause health 
problems IF YOU PICK IT UP AND EAT IT- 
Until you. as an individual, make the deci- 
sion to consume ihe hamburger, it poses no 
danger to you. Why is a restaurant responsi- 
ble for your individual eating habits? This is 



aiiother clear case of shifting responsibiLly world.

SpfaiPigtime 
IxposMfe 



all know wlial thai means: fresh 
spring flowers, light rain wilh 
suiuiy skies, green grass and 
girls' Ihongs. Every year at ttiis 
time, it seems that girls every- 
where just seem to let it all 
h.lngout. 

I ean'l fathom why or how so 
many gtrls manage lo expose 
Iheir panties on a daily basis 
tfiis lime of Ihe year. Making an 
attempt to give them Ihe benefit 
of the doubl, I came up with a 
few possible reasons as lo why 
guls feel the desire lo continually 
expose themselves. 

1, Maybe Ihey genuinely 
don'l know that their underwear 
is sneaking out of Iheir so-low- 
rise-that-1-make-every- 
p lumber-In- tow n'jealous panls. 
Apparently they don'l feel Ihe 



draft bre 



s their 



derriere. 

a. Maybe the women feel 
Ihey aic oiticing men by showing 
them their panties early on in 
relationships. Maybe Johruiy is 
just wailine for a reason to talk 
to you and you are providing 
him Ihe perfect conversation 
opener. Hey. I saw your 
panties. It's funny because my 
sislet has Ihe same pair." Think 
of all the great conversations 
that could arise thanks to 
underwear alone. 

3, Maybe these girls partook 
in the Victoria Secret Semi- 
Ann ual bra buying marathon 
and are showing off their 
trophies. 

In case readers have never 
been invited to one of these 
events, allow me to explain. It's 
the only lime of the year when 
women ol all shapes and sizes 
cram into Victoria's Secret and, 
like wild savages, dig through 
bins of underwear and bras 
trying lo find their size and the 

-best price, - 

After women have been 
through this challenge of 
womarffiood. maybe some feel 
it is necessary to display their 
trophies so all the world can see 
Ihem, I bet these women who 



show that they havi 
completed one of the tasks 
necessary to become a woman. 
They came, they conquered and 
now they proudly display their 
badge of courage, 

4, Maybe some of these 
girls just forgot a bell, which 
caused their panls lo sag 
enough to show Iheir panties. 



This IS highly doubtful because 
generally these girls who alloiv 
their undenvear to shoiv arc 
the same girls who have the 
jeans thai arc so light that they 
make Olivia Newton Johns 

Eants from "Crease" took like 
aggy skateboarding pants, 
5. Maybe some girls were 
Iraumatized by Ihe famous 
day-of-weck imdenvear as little 
girls. Maybe they accidentally 
wore a pair wilh Tuesday written 
on il durmg a Thursday and all 
the kids in school found oul 
and made fun of them. Now 
those Turad ay /Thursday girls 
feel compelled lo shoiv the 
world thai Ihey really do wear 
a different pair of underwear 



1 would also like st 
explain lo me why girls still 
insisi on having Iheir bra straps 
shcnving, TWs isn't as fashionable 
as il u^ lo be. There arc bras 
made without straps and Ihey, 
surprisingly enough, can be 
worn under tank lops and 
dresses wluch makes Ihe outfit 
look a little more polished and 
docs leave something lo Ihc 
imagination. 

What 1 shudder at the 
most are those girls who arc 
wearing shorts and tank tops. 
Nol oniy do their bras show, 
bul their underwear too. This 
isn't sexy, it's just sloppy and 
skanky. Girls leave nolning up 

anymore. Think atout how 
many well-dressed guys alloiv 
Iheir traxers lo hang out anymore? 
It was a passing fad. It s over 
and done with, dead. So why 
should women continue it? 

Allow me to now provide a 
lew possible solutions to the 
underwear problem. Try actually 
wearing a real belt. Nol jusl one 
o( Ihose decorative "1 have no 
purpose other than to weifih 
down your pants and make 
your hips look larger" belts, I 
mean a real bell. II girls can'I 
handle keeping iheir underwear 
on Ihe inside of their pants then 
they sure can't handle fun belts. 
How about buying low-rise 
underwear? They cost Ihe 
same, have prelly pall ems and 
they are made for low-rise pants. 

All in all, showing underwear, 
mostly thongs, isn I necessary 
or at all attractive. But for Ihose 

Sris who do plan on making 
e world aware of the color, 
style and fabric of their under- 
wear, il is advised that you not 
sil in the front of the room 
because people like me really

State student Tommy Alorxso, 
-When you're an imporlani piece of 
a prized puzzle like cWo, you 
tend to feel belter about yourself," 

Alorxso, who uses the character 
Chns Cypher, is not the only 
competitor who takes the cWo 
seriously- Owner Carlos Govantcs. 
whose character is Kyle Kash, 
spends many late nights working on 
eWo business, not to mention paying 
fees to keep the cWo's official Web 
site open, all while attending classes 
at Florida International University. 

Most of the competitors in cWo 
share the common desire to one day 
be professional wrestlers. However, 
tor some e-fed stars, that dream is 
more likely to be filled on this 
Internet wrestling circuit, 

"t watched wrestling since [ 
was like five, and I always wanted to 



be like them," said University of 
Missouri-Columbia student Jake 
Hancock, While competing as Alex 
Manning in cWo and dreaming of a 
future in the ring, Hancock later 
ruled out the chance ol that when he 
added. "Cod. no, 1 would be killed." 
v/hen asked if he would ever pursue 
a career in Ihc business. 

Having a career in professional 
wrestling ls not that far off for all e- 
fcd enthusiasts. Former cWo com- 

Sietitor Dominik O'Cronin lell the c- 
ed world to enter a California 
wrestling school last fall. Since that 
time. aCronm signed a contract lo 
compete exclusively in (apan until 
mid-2004, 

O'Cronin may someday be 
joined by cWo's Chris Manning, "II 
has been a dream of mine since 1 was 
12 years old." Manning said. "My 
cWo character is the same character I 
have used since 1997 and the origi- 
nal basis was what my character 
would be if I was a true wrestler and 
it was almost research for when that 
day came. Six years later, I've got a 
hell of a lot of material," 

All of the competitors in cWo 
fit the stereotypical descripHon 
ol the college student who works in 
c-feds in his free time. Long time 
cWo competilor Manning is 24- 
ycars-old. His days in e-feds come in 
nis free time from a lull-lime job and 
raising his two children. Despite the 
fact that Manning, who competes as 
"Hot Shot" Chris Michaels is leaving 
the e-fed world behind, he feels that 
the cult following of e-fed wrestling 
will only grow. 

"E-feds ate gelling so interuc 
nowadays thai guys like us (e-fed 



Davis and Alex Mannings that it 
seems more interesting and a hell of 
a lot more interesting than what 
Vioce [McMahonl and Jerry Jarrelt 



put out," Maruiing said, arc best friends which is cool and 

Another favorite part of e-fed niakes the e-fed fun.' 
wrestling for some is Ihc rash that cWo will continue lo grow with 

certain aspects bring. no evidence that il will falter any- 

"When you have |usl finished a lime in Ihe near future. This past

you wait for results to come out, you facilitate 



thai 



Christopher Beck, 
Archbisliop Williams High School in 
Boston, Mass. who competes as 
Chris Fury. 

After hme, this cult-like foUowuig 
of e-feds has developed into a place 
where light circles of 
Itiends come together, 
not just to talk about 
wrestling, but about 
life, 

"The bonds 1 have 
grown throu^ hanging

These friends have

me up and helped me

a lot of friends in real 
life have ever done for

tlin 
lo decline in ratings ar

Museum of Art exhibits mold-breaking artist, ceramics 



The hardwood floors jnd 
aletilc while walls are sirongly 
conlrasled by the works ol 

fcnius that dccorale Ihem. 
eauliful ceramic sculptures 
have been transformed from 
ordinary plates, dishes and 
vases mio such subjects as owls, 
woirien. fish arul even bullfights. 
Now walking into the Fort 
Wayne Museum of Art is like 
traveling into a fresh and 
w on derfuf world. It is the world 



of F 



.- The 



^ has on exhibit "Picasso — 
Z5 Years of Edition Cerarrucs" 
until April 13. 

This exhibition and museum 
tour is displaying works of 
Picasso from the Edward and 
Ann Weston Collection of Los 
Angeles, Calif. After traveling 
Ihroughout Europe, they 
expanded Ihc collection in the 
inld-1980s, and i1 is now one of 
the largest collections in Ihe 
United Slates. 

Famed for his paintings, 
sculptures and graphics, Picasso 
became intetesled in ceramics. 
At a crafis fair in 1946, PicasSo 



saw the works of ihe Madoura 
potters. Operating Ihe studio 
where Ihe crafts fair was held, 
Georges and Suzanne Ramie 
were asked by Picasso to give 
him Ihe opportunity to work 
wilh ceramics. 

In order to work at Rarric^' 
shidio, Picasso allowed lhem^^l^■^^ 
lo sell and make cdilion.s m 
ceramics that he produced whik 
in Ihe studio, and Ihe Ranm.'- 
could retain all profits. With studio 
space set aside from 1947 to 
1971. Picasso personally m.idc 
thousands of pieces, most o( 
which he kept. 

With varied involvement in 
Ihe artislic process, Picasso and 
Ihe Madoura studio produced 
633 different obiects. Picasso and 
the artudns at the Madoura shidio 

firoduced editions wilh the 
inishcd prototype. 

Enjoying Ine many ways 
ceramics bridged the gap 
between scutpling and painting, 
Picasso us«d clay since his early 
experiences wilh it in Paris. 

By using clav as a medium, 
he could transform ordinary, 
functional and domestic objects 
into works of art. The bold colors 
an Ihe plate "Brown/Blue Face" 




"Goafs Head in Profile." The 
head of the goat was created 
wilh brilliant lutt^uoises and 
grays, striking Ihe viewer ^^'iIh a 
display of vivid imagination, 
hut remaining strongly realistic. 
Picasso's love tor Ihe natural 
world was not contained to just 
aiumal subjects; he also created 
the shit lite "Bunch with Apple" 

More humanistic figures 
become prominent wilh a piece 
like Ihe round plate "Disheveled 
Woman" and "Cenlaur," a 
round dish.

frequently 



and "Diaulos Player," while 
mistakenly simple in appearance, 
bring the viewer lo all comers ol 
the plate and finally (o ils center, 
much like how Picasso used oils 
in his paintings, 

Picasso also played wilh 
illusion in his work "Hands wilh 
Fish," which plays with the 
distinction between reality and 
what seems lo be real. The natural 
way Ihe fish and the hand flow 



makes it hard to distinguish 
which pact of the piece belongs 
to what subject. 

And while natural objects 
were abundant in the collection, 
none seemed as fluid as the fish 
in Ihe pieces "Three Sardines" 
and "Black Ground Fish." From 
a distance it may even appear 
that there was actually a fish on 
Ihe plale. which is true, and 
somewhat disturbing about 



Creek style of reconding myths, 
legends and military conauesK. 
Picasso adapted Ihe style (or his 
oivn works in lelting narratives. 
"Bearded Yan," "Utile Sun" and 
"Yan Sun" are examples of 
Picasso's contribution of Ihe 
Greek Iradilion. 

But Picasso did not limit 
tiimsclf tojust traditional cenunics. 

alternative to woodcutting, 
Picasso embraced the use of 
linoleum cutting and al Ihe age 
of 77 produced Ihe work "Slill 



Life with Cherries and 

Walermelons." 

Picasso pioneered a way of 
multicolor prinhng of linoleum 
by carving a part of the design 
and then printing Ihat section. 
This way was more spontaneous 
and appropnalc lo the manner 
in whicn Picasso prided himself 
on working, as wilh his piece on 
display "Head of a Woman." 

Perhaps the collection's 
most exciling and narrative 

Eieccs are those that used bull- 
ghling as a subjecl. Picasso 
almost always draws Ihe alien lion 
of Ihe piece to the picador on 
horseback, and brings Ihe viewer 
lo Ihe ring as in "Pic.ldor wilh 
Lance and on Horseback." 

The bullfight was popular 
in Picasso's pieces because it 
cosily symbolized the struggle 
for survival, an imporlonl subjecl 
that Picasso used as inspiration 
throughout his Ic 
lally Fori

He writes from a

Thompson wanted "Fear and

"Most of our games have been

season surgery to repair a lorn anterior 
cruciate ligament in his left knee. 

Both of Ihe players' seasons were cut 
short, though, when Zbyszewski tore his 
repaired ACL in the lifth game of the match. 

"When Jelr tried to play last year against 
Long Beach, he was at maybe 70 percent/' 
said IPFW coach Amie Ball. When Matty got 
hurt the second time, that's when we decided 
to let Jeff lolally recover from his injury as 
well. Both were very seven; athlelic injuries." 

With Plak and Zbyszewski taking 
medical redshirfs last season, the Dons ballled 
to an 5-16 recond in 2002 with then-junior 
Arcangel Ruiz, the team's second-leading hitter 
in 2001, leading the way. 

"It was a\o\ of pressure," Ruiz said of

IPFW needed just Ihree games lo handle the

"Matty and Jeff are both premier playei;,

team. Adcr walching Ihe team play Friday 
[Jan. 17] aeainsi Santa Barbara, we began to 
undersland how important Matty was lo our

into Ihe lineup on Sunday [fan. 19], il was the 
exclamation mark on how imporlanl those 
three kids really arc lo our propam."

IPFW men's volleyball 
coach Amie Ball wants his players 
lo be relaxed when they're on 
the court. 

But not loo relaxed. 

After taking a two-game 
advantage over (Juincv. the 
Mastodons let their guani down 
and il nearly alloived the Hawks 
lo force a fourth game. The Doris 
managed lo hang on. though, lo 
open Ihclr Midwest Intercollegiate

a 30-23, 30-23 and 30-28 victory 
Friday al the Gates Center, 

'We let down with our 
energy, and we really let down 
with our passing and serving. 
We just \veien'l very aggressive." 
Ball said. "We were just kind of 

going ttuough the motions in 
le third game," 

IPFW never trailed in Ihe 
third game. However, they 
never led by more than six poinls. 
After jumping out to on 
early lead, the Dons allowed the 
Hawks lo even the score early at 
5-5 following an error by Mall 
Zbys/cwski. A kill and two 
straight aces by Jeff Plak then 
IPFW ahead by Ihree poinls. 



Runha then trimmed the IPFW 
lead back lo three poinls. but 
three consecutive errors by 
Quincy allowed Ihe Dons to 
build their lead to21'l5. 

The Hawks then clawed 
their way back with a 5-1 run to 
make Ihe score 22-20. The score 
remained close and IPRV led bv 
just three when it reached match 
point at 29-26. A kill by Branden 
Been and an error by 
Zbyszewski then made the score 
29-2S bclore a kill by Plak ended 
the match. 

"We didn't pass the ball 
very well [at the end]. 1 don't 
think it was so much whal 
Quincy did as much as what we 
didn't do," Ball said. "We made 
a couple hilling errors. It was 
more of us than them." 

IPI^ (4-1, 1-0 MiVA) was 
led by Zbyszewski with 16 kills, 
four blocks and an ace. Plak 
finished with 16 kills and two 
aces while Dennis Santiago had 
s, 12 digs and 



Ball said. I'm sure he'd like lo 
swing at the ball more, but he 
col a chance to play and I 
thouoht he did a really nice job 
of filling in al places where we 
may need somebody to fill in." 

As a team, Ihe Dons finished 
with 20 lolal blocks, well above 

"Mall came in today and 
watched some videotape, and 1 
thought his blocking was much 
improved. I thought Angel [Ruizj 
did a nice job," Ball said. "We 
touched a lot ol balls early. 
We've got lo tum those into
