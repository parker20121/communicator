Academic Affairs still looking for vice chancellor 



by Adam Taylor 
Features Edilor 



The search for the new vice 
chancellor of Academic Affairs is siill 
on from last fall. 

According (o Steven Sarratore, 
chairman of the Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Search Commitiee 
and associate professor of theatre, 
the search has been narrowed lo one 
candidate, although the committee is 
still looking for applicants. 

"The committee met after the 



three candidates came and inter- 
viewed," Sarraiore said, "and decid- 
ed to keep the search open for a 
while longer. So we're still accepting 
candidates and hope lo have another 
interview in the next couple 
months." 

According lo Sarraiore. the orig- 
inal three candidates have been nar- 
rowed down to one, Greg 
Weisensicin, who is currently dean 
of the School of Education at The 
University of Colorado, Colorado 
Springs. 

"His name is siill in the mix and 



we'll have to see what will happen 
within the next few weeks," Sarratore 
said. 

Candidate Patrick Schloss, vice 
president and dean of graduate stud- 
ies at Bloomsburg University, with- 
drew his application and candidate 
James Pula, dean of The 
Metropolitan College of Catholic 
Universities in Maryland, was turned 
down b&gt; the committee, said 
Sarratore. 

The vice chancellor position is 
lemporarilj being filled b&gt; Susan B. 
Hannah but will likely be filled per- 



manently b)' the end of the semes- 
ter. "1 think we will have to come to 
some sort of a decision by gradua- 
tion, b)' finals week," Sarraiore said. 
"We would have had concluded the 
interviews on campus bj then. We 
would really not like to have to do 
the inieniews o\er the summer." 

"Right now we don't have an) 
formal meetings at this point," said 
James Hersberger, associate chair 
and professor of mathematical sci- 
ences and member of the search 
commitiee, "but as we're getting 
applications in people are going 



down and viewing 
the application in 
anticipation of a 
meeting," 

"When you 
get into a search 
process, some- 
times it's success- 
ful and sometimes 
it isn't." said 
Chancellor 
Michael Wartell. 
"When it isn't, )'0u 
have to continue."

'Deaf World' shares everyday activities with IPFW students

Junior, Ivlelissa George, signs to members ol 'Deal World' at one of Ihe many stations. The stations represent 
various businesses, such as a drug store or hospital. 



I ^-^ I n March Z4, the hearing world 
W '^ of IPFW was given the opportuni- 
H H ty to experience the world of a 
I ^»^^l deaf person. 

"Deaf World", organized bj- 
Cj'nthia Dodzik, associate faculty of audiol- 
ngy and speech sciences, and the audiolog&gt; 
.ind speech sciences department, allowed 
hearing people to interact with deaf individ- 
uals in an envir onment without 
any verbal communication. 

"The event helped people understand 
what it's like to be in a deaf svorld," said 
Katherine Brace, sixth grader at Summit 
Middle School. "You realize that communi- 
cating with others and making them under- 
stand what the) are trying to say is the 
hardest thing for deaf people." 

Although the concept of Deaf World is 
not new, Dodzik organized the event at 
IPFW as a chance for students and commu- 
nic&gt; members to experience the deaf world. 

"It's a commonly used technique for 
trsing to bring deaf people and hearing 
people together," Dodi^ik said. "It shows you 
how it feels to be In a culture In which you 
can't communicate in the same mode you 
are used to." 

About 93 people able to hear attended 



the e\'ent, as wqW as 20 deaf volunteers. The 
i;ame involved traveling to different busi- 
nesses, represented by deaf volunteers, and 
making successful communication. 

According to Steve Evans, a deaf volun- 
teer at Deaf World, the event provided the 
hearing with a chance to experience the 
deaf world. 

"I think that the hearing can join with 
the deaf people to talk without voices," 
Evans said. "(At Deaf World) the hearing got 
to see what it's like without sounds, using 
signs instead to communicate." 

Currently, IPFW offers courses in 
American Sign Language (ASL) through the 
department of audiology and speech sci- 
ences and through Continuing Education. 
Dodzik hopes that in the future IPFW might 
be able to have an ASL language lab for ASL 
students to use. 

'It would help create some opportunity 
for ASL students to use the language," 
Dod/iksaid. 

'■A lot of these labs (at other universi- 
ties) are operated by deaf people, which 
gives students a much more casual atmos- 
phere to practice the language. That's when 
language acquisition really happens." 

For more information on registering for 
ASL classes, contact either the audiology 
and speech sciences department at 481- 
6410 or Continuing Education at481-(.G19. 



IPSGA makes 24-hour computer lab success for fall 



by Carrie Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 



Twenty-four hour lab access in 
the library study lounge will be 
available to students by the fall 
semester of 1999. 

The idea originated in the IPSGA 
by student body vice-president Jim 



Corson. 

"Manj' returning adults and stu- 
dents who work jobs that have odd 
hours needed this type of senice to 
meet their educational needs," 
Corson said. 

Four to five computers will be 
available for 24-hour use, along with 
both campus and regular telephones, 
vending machines, and e-mail kiosks. 



Ihe computers will ha\'e the Helmke 
Library's lUCAT on-line search and 
word processing for those students 
that need them. 

Although the 24-hour lab will 
need funding to be started and con- 
tinue operating, most of the mone&gt; 
will be taken from student serNice 
fees. 

"The cost of doing it is minimal 



compared to the bonclit a 24-hour 
lab will have for students," said Rob 
Loper, chair of the student affairs 
committee for IPSGA and senate 
member. 

Students were also surveyed bj- 
the IPSGA about having a 24-hour 
lab. 

"0\envhclmingly students were 
verj adamant in the fact that the; 



wanted weekend hours of labs to 
increase and also that a 24-hour lab 
would be extremely helpful," Corson 
said. 

Approval for the lab has been 
given bj' the Information Technology 
Policj' Committee (ITPC) of IPFW and 
the 24-hour lab is currently awaiting 
implementation. 



Students can obtain refunds during tax time 



by Carrie Leathers, 
Chiel reporter 



Students who are financially dependent 
on their parents can still file a lax return and, 
in many cases, receive a refund. 

"The main reason students should file is 
because they likely are entitled to a refund," 
said James Loebl, assistant professor of taxa- 
tion and business law. 

Most students who work during the sum- 



mer generall) earn less than S4.250, the 
amount at which the law requires a tax return 
to be filed, according to the IRS Dallas Call 
Site. 

Although students who earn less than this 
are not required b) law to file a lax return, 
given the low income level of such students, a 
tax refund from the federal government could 
be as much as a few hundred dollars. 

"Frequentiy for students, they have sever- 
al income taxes withheld and end up not 
owing as much as was withheld." Loebl said. 
"But if you don't file, then you can't get back 



the refund back for what you o\erpaid." 

Students and the communitj can receive 
free assistance in filling out their tax returns at 
one of three VITA (volunteer Income tax assis- 
tance) locations in Fort Wayne. 
-At IPFW every Thursda&gt; from 1-4 p.m. and 6- 
9 p.m. in Kettler 108B. 

-At the East Wa&gt;ne Communit)' Center, 801 
East Wayne, Saturday from 9 a.m.-noon. 
-At the Allen County Public Library, Tuesdays 
from 2-4 p.m. and 7-9 p.m.. 

"What you need to bring with you (to one 
of these locations) are any W-2 forms that you 



received from your employer{s) and any form 
1099 of any type that you received," Loebl 
said. 

Anyone with questions about filing their 
tax returns can contact the IRS free tax help 

line at 1-800-829-1040.

Schwarzkopf shares wisdom with gathering at Colisuem 



by Tracy Powell, 
Statf Wmer 



Retired General Norman 
Schwarzkopf addressed business 
and community leaders at the 
Memorial Coliseum Tuesday night 
with a speech entitled "Leadership: 
From the War Room to the Board 
Room." 

Encompassing events from his 
early military career to the present, 
Schwarzkopf shed light on recent 
developments in Kosovo, touched 
on our country's military position 
heading into the next millennium 
and shared insight about what true 
leadership is- 

Expcctations were high before 
the event, according to Barb 
Richards, program director for WAJl 
9S.1FM, who said, "I expect to hear 
ways that his challenges as a general 
can relate to me in my manage- 
ments as well as how some of the 
"battle talk' can help me with com- 
petition 1 face in my work." 

For Bob Rockstroh, news direc- 
tor for NBC33. the reason for his 
attendance was clearly motivational. 

"Last year we went to see Colin 
Powell, who was a great motivational 
speaker. We're wanting to hear 
Schwarzkopf and compare the two 



men and their sc&gt; les." 

As Commander-in-Chief of the 
United States Central Command, 
General Schwarzkopf led U.S. and 
allied forces in the Persian Gulf dur- 
ing operations "Desert Shield" and 
"Desert Storm" against Iraq in 1991, 
during which he was dubbed 
"Stormin' Norman." 

He also was deputy commander 
of the Joint Task Force in charge of 
the U.S. military invasion of the 
Caribbean Island of Grenada. 

Throughout his speech, 
Schwarzkopf emphasized his leader- 
ship roles in his infiuential endeav- 
ors, up 10 and including his tenure 
as a four-star general. 

What man) of the attendees 
anticipated was covered by the gen- 
eral in his commentary on business 
practices from managerial and lead- 
ership roles. 

"Leadership is not manager- 
ship," said Schwarikopr "Managers 
manage things, leaders lead people." 
The bulk of the speech consist- 
ed of parallels between lessons 
learned in leadership in his miliiar) 
life and what can be applied in any 
size and any tjpe of organization, 
even leadership in the home. 

Some common points the gen- 
eral drove home included the fact 



that character is a prime ingredient 
of a leader, that true rewards in 
leadership lie in the leadership itself 
without seeking tangible benefit and 
that no organization will ever get 
better unless its leaders admit some- 
thing is wrong and needs fixed. 

"Two secrets to use to be a 
great leader in the twenty-first cen- 
tury," Schwarzkopf said, "are when 
placed in command, take charge, 
and more imporiantiy, to do what's 
righl." 

Emphasizing the critical ele- 
ment of taking responsibilit&gt; , he 
gathered many instances around the 
Desert Storm era to paint a picture 
of what true leadership consisted of. 

The element of success was also 
spelled out when he said, "Success is 
infectious," and went on to explain 
the importance of reinforcing suc- 
cess in the workplace. 

Relative to current issues, 
Schwarzkopf responded to IPFW 
Chancellor Michael Wartell who 
asked what state of readiness our 
armed forces were in. 

"Because of reductions in the 
armed forces and budget cuts, and 
»vith troops scattered over the globe, 
we couldn't do a Desert Storm again. 
Also, the morale of the troops are 
low due to below-poveriy paj', in 



some cases. 

His pride in our nation's troops 
was evidenced by his description of 
what he said to a woman who 
thanked him for restoring her faith 
in our country. 

"It wasn't me who restored your 
faith in your country, il was the 
540,000 soldiers who left on short 
notice and slept in the desert and 
sacrificed their lives," he stated. 

Schwarzkopf said ihe speech 
came at an admitledlj' perfect time, 
because the world currently needs 
leadership. 

He was introduced b&gt; Mayor 
Paul Helmke who said General 
Schwarzkopf brings us proven lead- 
ership commentar) in "...a time 
when we're looking for heroes." 

"This event is great for three 
reasons," commented Greg Spahie\' 
of Re/Ma.\ Realtors. 

"It's great for the Fort Wayne 
community; it's a great event for 
IPFW where the school is giving back 
lo the communit&gt;', and it's an event 
where you can learn from his expe- 
rience." 

The event was presented b&gt; 
IPFW, and proceeds will benefit the 
Hilliard Gates Athletic Scholarship 
Fund.

Staff Editorial 



This year's studeni goxt-rnment elections were 
a total bust. Last yearns pathetic numbers were 
low enough, but this jear's numbers were worse. 
What's up with that? 

IPFW is not a small campus. There are nearlj' 
11,000 students that are registered on this cam- 
pus, and yet, somehow, onh' 323 of you picked up 
a pencil and marked your choices for IPSGA 
President. That's only 3 percent of the student 
population. We're not going to mince words here: 
This dectioii turnout was wretched. 

Why is it such an effort for anyone lo get 
in\'oKed in anything around here? How hard is it 
lo pick up a pencil and chetk a box? Surprise, it's 
not as difficult as you might imagine. 

Man&gt;', including the newl&gt;' re-elected student 
bod\' president, ha\'e blamed the lack of participa- 
tion on a lack of advertising. Honestly, there's 
more to it than that. 

IPFW consistently lacks student participation 
across the board in man\' activities. IPSGA elec- 
tions notivithsianding. This is generally' blamed on 
our "commuter campus" status. 

In man)' cases, this is entirely true. IPFW stu- 
dents ha\'e jobs and commitments outside of cam- 
pus, and tend to spend xerj' little lime engaging 
in campus activities. 

We at The Communicator try our best lo bring 
\.^u information about what's out there, but we 
onl&gt;' have a certain amount of pages to devote to 
hundreds of activities. There comes a point where 
&gt;ou. the student, have to seek things out on your 
ou'n. 

There are many groups that work hard to 
make the IPFW experience a good one. Why not 
take advantage of what the\' have to offer? 

SAB. for example, sponsors comedians, musi- 
cians and other types of entertainment on a regu- 
lar basis. 

Our athletic department sponsors many 
events, including a recent visit from Colin Powell 
and this week^s visit from General Norman 
Schwarzkopf. ■ 

There are campus organizations to meet your 
every hobby, need or want. IPFW studenls owe it 
to themselves to get involved with what goes on 
around here. IPSGA elections are only one waj' to 
make your presence and jour ideals known. 

After all, college is something thai most peo- 
ple onij' experience once-wh\' just slide by with- 
dut getting more for &gt;our mone&gt;'?

Reader responds to 

Anti-Vegetarianism 

Column 



I think there should be a 
counterpoint to the recent 
"Vegetariansim Commentarj." 
What's the reasoning behind the 
statement that while vegetarians 
don't eat what their forefathers 
ate, the)' would jump off a cliff if 
someone told them? Are vegetari- 
ans not challenging the authorit)' 
and tradition of what people told 
them? 

Vl/hy did the "gullible" people 
stop eating meat? The American 
Diabetic Association states that 
vegetarian diets are associated 
with reduced risks of obesit)', 
coronar&gt;' heart disease, h&gt; perten- 
sion, diabetes and many cancers. 
The leading cause of death in 
America is heart disease, which is 
almost always caused by arterial 
blocking cholesterol (which is 
only found only in meat). Other 
things that have been found in 
meat include arsenic, salmonella, 
rodent feces, cockroaches and 
rust. Also, too much protein is 
hard on ihe kidneys, which strug- 
gle to remove the nitrogenous 
poisons from the body. 

The commeniar)' also states 
that we can't say that plants don't 
have feelings. Plants don't have a 
nervous system like animals, 
which enable them {and us) to 
fee! pain. However, almost all ani- 
mals have very humanlike emo- 
tions, which any pet owner 
knows. Could you kill and eat 
your pet? Repulsed by the idea? 



What's the real difference 
bet\vcen your pet and a cow, pig 
{great pets) or a chicken? 

the grocer)' store makes us 
feel remo\'cd from he murders of 
these animals. Most "meat-pro- 
ducing" animals today live in 
cages so tight the)''ll never be 
able to turn around. In man) 
chicken farms it is so crowded 
that the ammonia from excre- 
ment makes many chickens go 
blind and the chicken's toes grow 
around the cage bars. In the 
slaughterhouses the assembl) 
lines go so fast that man) animals 
aren't killed when the) are 
skinned or are lowered by their 
feet into boiling water. 

Now how can jou make fun 
of vegetarians?

Student expresses feelings about U.S. 
involvement in Iraq ana Yugoslavia 



To students of ll'FW: 

Last Tuesda)', a rail)' was held to 
end sanctions against Iraq and last 
Wednesday, NAFO started the bomb- 
ing of militar)' targets in Yugoslavia. 
Man) gripes and complaints might be 
valid IF AND ONLY IF those countries 
lived up to their word and DID NOT 
commit acts of atrocities against their 
own people. 

Let us begin with Iraq: 

Whether the Iraqis like to admit 
il or not, the Iraqis tost the war in a 
humiliating wa) . Iraq, hut more 
specifically, Saddam Hussein, thumbs 
his nose ai the world communit) 
telling us that the)' are a sovereign 
nation and the UN does not have the 
right to search Iraq for weapons of 
mass destruction. 

Hold on liore. 1 thought Iraq lost 
that war. Iraq gave a complete sur- 
render to the UN forces. Iraq no 
longer has a right to set any demands 
upon the UN. It is the UN that can 
and has the right to set demands 
upon Iraq. Iraq should surrender and 
open up all facilities to the UN. 
Complaints of Iraq about the U.S. 
having spies on the weapons team is 
a so-whai situation. We can give up 
the seats of U.S. inspectors, but is 
Iraq's complaint against the U.S. or is 
the complaint against anyone looking 
for weapons of mass destruciion? 

There is a complaint on some 
posters around the school of a little 
girl and a question that is para- 
phrased, "Is she really our enemy?" 

The answer to that is a definite 
"NO," she is not an enemy of anyone, 
nor is any Iraqi an enemy of anyone. 



I enjo) talking to people from differ- 
ent countries \ia the Internet and 
ICQ, It is not and never will be a gripe 
with the Iraqi people. It is a com- 
plaint to the Iraqi government. The 
sanctions that are in place do nol 
affect the medical supplies or food- 
stuffs 10 Iraq. The UN and the U.S. 
want the Iraqi people to once again 
become prosperous, but it does not 
want Iraq lo be able to wage another 
war against surrounding nations as it 
did against Kuwait. 

Now to Yugoslavia: 

Milosevic had a choice. His 
choice was to either sit down and talk 
peace with the ethnic Albanians in 
the Kosovo province, or NATO would 
start air strikes against Yugoslavia. 
The first time Milosevic did sit down 
with the warring factions. Those 
agreements are called the "Dayton 
Peace Accords." This last time, 
Milosevic refused to talk peace, leav- 
ing no option but to carry out air 
strikes. This is the only option 
because a threat does not mean any- 
thing if the threat will not become 
reality if the conditions are not met. 

One of m) friends on ICQ is a 
Serbian; 1 talked with her about two 
days after the beginning of the air 
strikes. She was talking about how 
definite ihe Serbs were to the 
Americans. I kept nying to explain to 
her that this was a NATO operation. 
This is a European affair and the US 
and Canada are part of NATO and as 
member nations to an organization 
we must contribute to the European 
effort. 

All she could do was complain 
about the deaths of civilians. All I can 



sa) to her is NATO is not tr) ing lo kill 
civilians, but sometimes it happens. 
The big problem is I do not hax'e 
complete confidence in her observa- 
tions. I do watch TV news (CNN and 
MSNBC), read the paper, and listen to 
the radio in m)' car. Like most 
Americans and members of NATO 
countries, I do nol want to see death 
and destruction of civilian popula- 
tions. Yugoslavia (Serbia) has brought 
this down on themselves. Yugoslavia 
makes a claim to be a sovereign 
nation, and Madeline Albright made a 
comment that their claiming to be a 
sovereign nation is like a child killing 
his parents and claiming compassion 
since he is an orphan. 

What happened during World 
War II should explain wh)' the argu- 
ment of being a sovereign nation 
does not hold up. The defense of 
NAZI war criminals was. "I was just 
following orders." The ruling to the 
war criminals was they had a higher 
law to humanit) . NATO is acting with 
the higher law of humanity. I may 
agree with their decision on bombing, 
or I might nol. 1 truly do not know. I 
can tell )'ou this. Bombing never 
affected the North Vietnamese to go 
lo the bargaining table. 1 hope that 
senseless killing is finished on both 
sides. Ground troops should be used 
to get the Serbs back to the bargain- 
ing table, but ground troops should 
never be used to destabilize the situa- 
tion and make a bad situation even 
worse. 



Writer addresses media silence about Iraq 



To the editor, 

I find U.S. corporate media 
silence toward our government's 
forced starvation policy against 
Iraq's people troubling. The same 
prim and broadcast media widely 
reported, and condemned, the use 
of hunger as a weapon when it was 
wielded by a disfavored militar)' fac- 
tion in Africa, but when politicians 
in Washington, D.C., use hunger 



against 20 million civilians in Iraq. 
the pundits and editors don't call it 
what it is. Most, in deference to offi- 
cialdom, ignore the death and suf- 
fering of innocent civilians which 
continues due to an embargo against 
a countr) whose people already lack 
clean water, medical facilities, 
schools, electricity and other neces- 
sities wiped out by bombs. 

Since sanctions were imposed in 
1990, "over one million Iraqi civil- 
ians have died from malnutrition 



and preventable or curable disease," 
over a million Iraqi children are now 
chronically malnourished, and 
between 4,500 and 6,000 children 
under the age of 5 die in Iraq each 
month from hunger or disease, 
according to UNICEF. 

The United Nations Food and 
Agricultural Organization reported 
that b)' 1995 the deprivations 
caused b) the blockade had "killed 
more than 567,000 children under 
the age of Tive" in Iraq, a casualt) 



list which has grown significand) in 
the past four years. 

1 am not excusing Saddam 
Hussein for his own brutalities- 
man) of which occurred without 
comment from U.S. corporate media 
outlets during the 1970s and 80s, 
when Saddam was considered a 
good guy worthy of military hard- 
ware by the US. State Department— 
rather, I think il is worth noting that 
President Clinton, Secretary of Slate 
Madeline Albright, and much of the 



U.S. Congress are intent on far sur- 
passing Saddam, in terms of ci\'ilian 
bod)- counts, b\ transforming Iraq 
into one great big Auschwitz in the 
Middle East, with the assistance of 
silent and compliant journalists.

All About The Movies: Kubrick legacy comes to an end 



by Ben Freese, 
Staff Wrher 



Several weeks ago, a legend of Hollywood 
passed away and the manner in which I 
learned this news was similar to the style of 
some grand folk tale. Rumors began to swirl 
around thai somebody important had died, 1 
had no idea who it was until a friend of mine 
said "Hey, did you hear? I think Stanley 
Kubrick died! Well, actually, I just saw the tale 
end of them ulking about his new movie, so It 
might have Just been about that." 

My reaction went from utter shock to 
gradual disillusionmeni and I chalked It up as 
one of those nasty little rumors. Besides, the 
paper hadn't said anything (at least not that 
I'd seen) and I even asked my parents if any- 
body important had died recen(l&gt; , but no dice. 

A week later, a customer at ^\ork (who was 
actually a big Kubrick fan and an old acquain- 
tance of mine) told me that Stanley Kubrick 
had died. Or, at least that's what he'd heard. 
See, he actually hadn't seen an) thing written 
about it at all, he'd simply heard the rumor. 

Later that same week, as I read a review of 
the inept sci-fi flick "Wing Commander," critic 
Roger Ebert remarked that the maker of 



"2001" would have been sad to note that sci-fi 
had fallen to this level. Finally, I thought, the 
written word proves what my worst fears had 
known! 

Only, he didn't actually say Kubrick was 
dead, it was more like an insinuation. Finally, 
after a week and a half which felt more like an 
eternity, I started lo see things about the 
passing away of the great Hollywood 
director. 

Stanley Kubrick is most well-known to sci- 
fi fans for creating the "larger then life" film 
entitled "2001: A Space Odyss-y," even though 
that was the onl&gt; sci-fi film the monolithic 
{"Odyssey" fans will get this reference) direc- 
tor ever made in his career. 

This film is undoubted!)' Kubrick's most 
famous and influential work of his life. It was 
not onl) the first big sci-fi "exent" film that 
captured the attention of movie critics (who 
deemed him as a newfound cinematic muster), 
it also had mass appeal and became an instant 
bo&gt; office hit. The 1968 story of actor Keir 
Dullea's journe) to the heart of the uni\erse 
with the infamous HAL computer in tow 
brought in o\er S20 million (at the time a 
huge amount) to make it the most successful 
sci-fi movie ever at that point in time.

ishing special effects to critics salivating over a 
new director they could trumpet as the messi- 
ah of all movies, Kubrick's "2001" was an enor- 
mous success. 

Fortunately, Kubrick proved to be a lot 
more then just some "one hit wonder." 
although he had already made several high!) 
regarded films, including "Spartacus" and "Dr. 
Strangelove," which are looked back upon as 
two of the film industries most memorable 
movies, 

"Spartacus" raised eyebrows with its high- 
ly controversial bathing scene between Ton) 
Courtis and Laurence Olivier (in I960!!), and 
"Strangelove" intrigued audiences with the 
ubiquitous Peter Sellers in the role of three dif- 
ferent characters during the United State's fic- 
titious war with Russia. (Personally, I think 
"Strangelove" has the funniest full title of any 
movie I've ever known: "Dr. Strangelove or: 
How I Learned to Stop Wonting and Love the 
Bomb.") The movie that unmistakably thrust 
Kubrick into the limelight, however, was 
"2001," 

Gi\en a chance to continue America's fas- 
cination with his art, Kubrick didn't disap- 
point. He followed with probablj' the greatest 
series of movies in a row any director has ever 
presented. "A Clockwork Orange," "The 
Shining," and "Full Metal Jacket" were his next 
films and they were all outstanding movies, 
both from critical and fan standpoints and also 
from m)' standpoint. Who could ever forget 
Malcolm McDovsell's haunting portrayal of an 
linglish gang rapist in the cult film "Orange," 
which was so graphic it had to be re-edlted to 
rccei\'e an R rating? 

t know I'll never get over Jack Nicholson's 
immensely frightening over-the-iop perfor- 
mance in "Shining," which was adapted from a 
Stephen King novel. Last, but assuredly not the 
least, the first half of "Full Metal Jacket" (a 



portrait of the training life of marine recruits 
that makes the other half of the film look like a 
Saturda) morning cartoon bj' comparison) 
leaves one's stomach in knots. 

This is undoubtedly due to the tense 
scenes of former real-life drill instructor R. Lee 
Ermey's shockingh' destructive altitude 
towards training his men. I. for one. wouldn't 
have e\'er wanted to come in contact with 
Ermey's pre-movie stardom! 

For some odd reason, "Jacket" (filmed in " 
1987) was Kubrick's last work until o\cr one 
jear ago when he began to film a new movie 
entitled "Ejes Wide Shut." 

This picture stars Tom "look at me I'm 
beautiful" Cruise and Nicole Kidman as se\ 
therapists in what is apparently being called 
one of his most coniroversfal movies ever 
(imagine that after watching his other films!). 
Due out this coming summer, "Ejes" has had a 
tumultuous reputation and has taken over a 
year to finall) get finished. 

Luckil). Kubrick was able to put the final 
touches on his product before he went to the 
great editing room in the sk) . 

Stanle) Kubrick was quite the unique indi- 
\'idual. He was a perfectionist (horror stories of 
him making Cruise do over 57 takes per scene 
abound), a creative genius (check out anj' of 
his previous 12 movies), and even a madman 
(a famous stor&gt;' of actor Harvej Keiiel waiting 
in a trailer for three months without even 
knowing who he'd plaj' before walking out 
gave "Ejes" some negaiixe press). 

Undoubtedly, though. Kubrick made great 
movies and will be missed b) many fans and 
people in the entertainment industr). 

1, tor one, am anxious to view his now filnv 
and see what the master's final vision of great- 
ness has in store for critics and fans abroad.

Student Spotlight 



IPFW student overcomes challenges, seeks political office 



by Ben Freese, 
SlaH Writef 



Many traditional IPPAf students 
live with their parents while going to 
school. 

For two jears. Bill Meinert, 45, 
has been going to school while he 
and his wife have been raising their 
two daughters. 

It is obvious that Meinert is not 
a traditional student at IPFW, well he 
does commute an hour from North 
Manchester. 

Meinert was drafted into the 
Navy in 1972 and worked for the 
service for 22 &gt;ears as a Hospital 
Corpsman Chief. 

Meinert has an associates 
degree in general studies from 
Indiana Uni\ersit)' and has lived all 
over the world. In 1994, he retired 
from the Nav&gt;'. 

"Continued education gives me 
the power and resources to make 
informed rational decisions with 
open eyes. I fear thai all too many 
people live with their eyes wide 
shut," said Meinert. 

Meinert went back to school 



with benefits from the G.I. Bill to 
receive a minor in sociology and 
communication. 

During his years at IPFW, 
Meinert has been a member of the 
forensics team. He will graduate in 
December of 1999. 

What to do after graduation? 

Run for office, of course. 

Meinert is a Republican running 
for town clerk and treasurer in 
North Manchester. 

His opponent is Republican 
Nancy Reed, who has been North 
Manchester's town clerk for 20 
years. 

According to Meinert, the town 
clerk is a full-time position. 

North Manchester's town clerk 
is responsible to the state and town 
citizens to fill all requests on the 
day-to-da&gt; activities of the town, 
Meinert said. 

The town clerk is responsible 
for public records of the town and 
town minutes from committee meet- 
ings, Meinert said. 

"I want this position for many 
reasons. First and foremost the cur- 
rent incumbent has been unopposed 



for the last three of four election 
cycles and it is morallj unacceptable 
that no one has challenged her," said 
Meinert. 

Meinert says he can e-mail his 
kids, buy things over the Internet 
and contact elected and non-elected 
members of the Indiana go\ernment 
via e-mail. 

"1 cannot communicate with any 
of our local town government with 
the current electronic infrastructure. 
1 feel like our tosvn is lagging 
behind," said Meinert. 

According to Meinert North 
Manchester runs on a \olunieer sjs- 
tem of government in which citizens 
must attend monthlj meetings to 
find out what is reallj going on in 
the town goxernment. 

"If jou have a question about 
an issue, &gt; ou must either attend 
town meetings or go to the council 
members' offices at their jobs or 
contact them at home. There is no 
open and easj access to our elected 
officials," Meinert said. 

Meinert fears that with North 
Manchester's current form of com- 
munication a conflict of interest 



could occur, especially if a person 
feels that thej' have to buj' some- 
thing from the business just to gain 

It is yer&gt;' time consuming for a 
citizen to gain information. 

Meinert wants to use the 
Internet and create a web-page so 
an&gt;'one, at their own leisure, can 
contact town emplo&gt;ees and gain 
information about town meetings. 

Meinert is for term limits on 
elected town officials and promises 
to limit his service to two terms. 

"Maintaining an elected office 
for 20 jears is not the best service 
that can be provided if you keep on 
doing business the same waj," 
Meinert said. 

Meinert says he is qualified for 
the position because he is willing to 
sene. 

According to Meinert, finding 
people to run for office in North 
Manchester has been difficult. 

Meinert beliefs he has qualifica- 
tions because he has worked for the 
Federal Government and is willing to 
do anjthing to sohe citizens' con- 
cerns. 



"I love to work 

with diversity and 

the challenge of 

trying something 

new that may 

involve the 

quality of life." 

-Bill Meinert 



-1 love to work with diversity 
and the challenge of trying some- 
thing new that maj improve the 
quality' of life," said Meinert. 

North Manchester will have its 
primary election May S. 

The winner of that elecdon will 
go on to run in the final elections in 
No\'ember. 

If Meinert is not elected, he 
wishes to go to law school. 



Health Fair offers alcohol 
screening April 6 



Did &gt;ou ever wake up next to someone 
you didn't know and not remember how you 
got there? 

Have you ever seen a friend pass out 
from drinking and wonder if you should call 
911? 

Are you just curious as to how you fit in 
with other college students and their drinking 
patterns? 

These questions will be addressed as well 
as others when IPFW participates in the 
National Alcohol Screening Daj' on Tuesday , 
April 6. 

Although the National Alcohol Screening 
Day is April 8, IPFW will be participating dur- 
ing the Health Fair from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on 
April 6. 

Some of the things offered at the Health 
Fair are self-tests for alcohol problems and 
free, anonymous education sessions regarding 
a variety of alcohol-related topics. 

Some topics included in the sessions are 
binge drinking, warning signs of alcoholism, 
what happens to the body when it's drunk, 
why some people can handle more alcohol 
than others and where one can go for help if 
they have a drinking problem. 

Attendants to the Health Fair wilt also be 
given the opportunity to fill out an anonj- 
mous questionnaire regarding alcohol as well 
as the chance to talk one-on-one with a 
trained individual who could possibly answer 
any questions one maj have and, if needed, 
direct them to proper support or treatment 
services. 

The 18-21 age range is the developmental 
period of heaviest alcohol consumption for 
most drinkers in the United States. 

Binge-drinking, or drinking several drinks 
in one sitting, is the type of alcohol problem 
most often engaged in by this age range. 

According to a 1994 study, 44 percent of 
college students reported that binge-drinking 



can lead to property damage, disciplinary 
problems, poor academic performance and 
even physical injur&gt;', illness and death. 

The college component of National 
Alcohol Screening Day focuses on binge-drink- 
ing and alcohol poisoning but also educates 
students about the clinical disorders of alco- 
holism and alcohol abuse. 

Donald Smith, personal counselor at 
IPFW, urges studenu become educated on the 
negative effects of alcoholism. 

"Students come to college and experience 
freedoms they never had before," Smith sa&gt;s, 
"but they also need information to make 
informed choices as well as guidance and 
understanding when things go wrong. This 
anonymous program is designed to make it 
easj' for anyone on campus to explore their 
use of and attitudes toward alcohol in a non- 
threatening, stigma-free environment." 

Donna Bialik, dean of students, shares the 
same attitude. "Eveoone has been to a parlj- 
and seen someone drinking too much," Bialik 
saj s. "What we don't think about is why, and 
what could happen to that person later that 
evening? I urge e\er&gt; student to participate in 
this program. It could save your life, or the 
life of a friend." 

National Alcohol Day is a program of the 
nonprofit National Mental Illness Screening 
Project (NMISP) in partnership with the 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism (NIAAAl, 

The college component of the program is 
funded bj' a grant from the Robert Wood 
Johnson Foundation.

UCONN, U BET 



Hamilton, 
El-Amin lead 
Huskies 
to national 
championship 

by Matt Schieer, 
Staff Writer 

In retrospect, maybe it 
was a good idea to play the 
games before declaring Duke 
as NCAA Tournament 
Champions. 

I admit I was on the Duke 
bandwagon. I could not envi- 
sion anyone stopping Brand, 
Langdon, Averj, Battier, and 
Carawcll even without the 
other four McDonald's All- 
Americans. None of the so- 
called experts gave 
Connecticut a chance to do 
much more than give Duke a 
good game. 

It was supposed to be so 
simple, Duke was the better 
team. Thej' had more talent, 
more depth, and the best 
coach in the game. They were 
the team of destiny, the team 
of the decade, but not the 
team of the night. 

That is why coaches 
coach, players play, and the 
media make ridiculous predic- 
tions, place unrealistic expec- 
tations, and second guess 
both pla&gt;ers and coaches. 

The irony in Duke's loss 
is that they were in the exact 
same position eight years ago, 
only the roles were reversed. 

UNLV was the indestruc- 
tible machine, rolling through 
the regular season unbeaten. 
The Runnin' Rebels were onlj' 
tested a couple of times (Ball 
State) and were the prohibi- 
tive favorite going into March. 

Duke shocked UNLV in 
the semi-finals and went on to 
win their first of two straight 
■ titles." This time Duke was the 
f^team crowned chapip^on in 
mid-February, only to lose 
their last game of the season. 

This was not Villanova 
beating Georgetown. UConn 
was a #1 seed. The Huskies 
lost only t&gt;vo games all sea- 
son, one of which without 
Hamilton and Voskuhl. They 
were ranked "1 for nearly 
half of the season, yet this was 
an upset? Virtually all of the 
experts had written Duke as 
champion, in ink. 

I'm as guiltj' as ever^'one 
of buying into the mystique 
and perpetuating the mj th. 
When you hear something 
over and over it begins to 
ha\e an effect. 

That is the last time 1 say 
something ridiculous like 
There is no way Duke is going 
to get beat. 

T\s'ent) years ago, college 



basketball was thrust into 
prime-time with Larry Bird 
facing Magic Johnson as their 
respective schools battled for 
the NCAA Championship. 
Since then t^velve of the twen- 
t&gt;' championship games have 
been decided by six points or 
less. 

These games are rarely 
blowouts, and they have pro- 
vided many memorable 
moments and phenomenal 
finishes. 

Michael Jordan first 
caught national attention as a 
freshman with his game win- 
ner against Georgetown. 

The last second 
airball/allcyoop sent Jim 
Valvano racing around the 
court delirious as his NC St. 
Wolfpack upset Phi Slamma 
Jamma. 

Hoosier fans will never 
forget where thej' were svhen 
Keith Smart's jumper hit the 
bottom of the net with four 
seconds left against Syracuse, 
and I'm sure Michigan fans 
still cringe when they see 
Chris Webber calling for a 
technical, er time-out. 
Incidentally, that Michigan/ 
North Carolina game in 93 
was last time two fll seeds 
played in a championship 
game, until this year. 

Of all the championship 
games I've seen, the 
Duke/UConn game was the 
most exciting from start to 
finish of them all. 

There were so many fac- 
tors that affected the outcome 
of this game. One of the most 
important was the officiating. 
Duke is notorious for getting 
preferential calls based on 
their name. 

For the most part, the 
refs put away their whistles 
and let them plaj. This 
allowed for a much more wide 
open st&gt;'le of play, which ben- 
efited UConn. They missed 
several ob\ious fouls, but 
they were consistent on how 
they were calling the game, 
Duke still made more free 
throws (21) than Connecticut 

UConn was never in seri- 
ous foul trouble, so they could 
substitute at will, not out of 
necessit)'. 

The three intangible fac- 
tors that contributed to the 
Huskie victorj' were compo- 
sure, confidence and aggres- 
siveness. Duke jumped out to 
an earl&gt; 9-2 lead, but UConn 
never panicked. 

They're is only so much 
that a coach can do from the 
sidelines. The difference 
between UConn and Michigan 
State is that the Huskies were 
hitting. The Spartans had 
plenty of clean looks against 
Duke but could not take 
adv antage. 

Since they were making 
their shots, Jim Calhoun was 
able to rotate his substitutes 
into the game without worr&gt;- 



Don 't Call it a Comeback! 



ing about drop-off. He got 
some unexpected production, 
and kepi his gujs fresh at the 
same time. Coach K did not 
substitute as much, and his 
gu&gt;s were obviously spent. 1 
could not understand how or 
why but Jim Calhoun clearly 
out-coached Mike KrzjzewskJ. 

With two full time-outs 
left. Duke was down bj a 
point (75-74) with :20 left in 
the game. Instead of calling 
one of the time-outs, and set- 
ting up a play Trajan Langdon 
dribbled into a traffic, spun 
and was called for traveling. 

Duke then called time- 
out. They immediately fouled 
Khalid El-Amin, who made 
both free throws. Then with 
onl) 5.2 seconds left, langdon 
dribbled the length of the 
floor into a triple team. He 
tripped and fell before getting 
a shot off and UConn won 77- 
74 for the school's first 
national championship. 

Although langdon made 
two critical mistakes in the 
final half-minute, you can't 
blame him. If it was not for 
Langdon and his 25 points, 
Duke wouldn't have been as 
close as they were. 

Coach K is one of the best 
in the game, but he clearl&gt; 
missed two opportunities to 
set up shots to save the game. 
He only used one substitute in 
the second half. He never 
made proper adjustments on 
how UConn was defending 
Ellon Brand, or how Duke was 
guarding Richard Hamilton, 
who scored 27 points. 

The most troubling thing 
is that after the game Coaih K 
said that he would do the 
same thing if he had the 
chance to do it over again. 

The coa(;hing factor 
aside, a number of things 
became apparent during this 
game. 

1 ) UConn's depth was 
better than Duke's. 

2) Duke was not as nearl&gt; 
battle tested as UConn. which 
was in a number of close 
games throughout the )ear. 
^and the tournament., 1 said 
before that it would fee inter- ' 
esting to see-how Duke react- 
ed if they were in a close 
game and we found out. 

3) UConn is led bj a 
number of experienced upper- 
classmen, while Duke is made 
mostlj of sophomores. 

Those sophomores let the 
lone senior, Langdon, have 
the ball in crunch time, and 
looked afraid to step up. 

In a tournament high- 
lighted bj' upsets, UConn 
pulled off the biggest. 

Should Elton Brand sta) 
at Duke, they will surely be 
the favorite again next jcar. 

The lesson learned this 
year should only make Duke 
stronger, and everyone else 
more careful about prema- 
turel)' awarding the champi- 
onships.

The Women's Softball team is coming off a 
season thej' would much like to forget: a sea- 
son which the team had to forfeit due to lack 
of interest. This year, however, the softball 
team is back. 

Led by two-sport athlete Christy McMillin 
and pitchers Missy Czaja and Leslie Stamets, 
the potential of this team is mind boggling. 

The Dons started off this "renaissance" 
gradually, dropping their first four games. 
However, the team did manage to salvage a 3-5 
preseason record. 

Coming into the season the Dons knew 
that the GLVCwas tough. But how tough? 

The&gt;' quickly found out, dropping seven 
of their first eight games and getting outscored 
49-19. 

The outcome was not one the IPFW coach- 
es wanted to see. However, in a double header 



against Quincy this past weekend, the Dons 
started to come together. 

Hurler Leslie Stamets pitched a complete 
six-hit game, onlj- allowing one run. 

The Dons put runs up on the board in the 
fourth and the fifth inning, giving them their 
first conference victoo'- 

That victoo' gave the team a much needed 
confidence boost. 

Against cross-town rival St. Francis, the 
Dons and Stamets produced a victory, winniiig 
the first game 9-6. 

Amanda Mannelli led the Dons with three 
hits and throe RBIs. Heidi Miller also had three 
hits, wo doubles and two RBIs. 

In the second game, Eastside graduate 
Miss) Czaja threw a three-hitter and onlj' 
allowed one run as the Dons won 4-1. Monica 
Hoback had two doubles and two RBIs while 
Sonia Atienzo had a double, a run scored and 
an RBL 

The Dons improved to a 6-12 record, win- 
ning three of their last four games.

Man with the Mike: 



School Spirit needed in atliletics 



by Brian Miller. 
Sports Editor 



This year's Men's 
Volleyball team is doin^ more 
damage to its opponents than 
the Melissa virus is doing to 
computers (Sorry sports fans 
but I am trying to appeal to a 
larger crowd!) Why? you 
might ask! Because this is 
IPFW Volleyball. 

Volleyball is the heart 
and soul of the athletic pro- 
gram and the model of what a 
prog ram/ team should be 
about. 



This team is made up of 
players from Canada, Puerto 
Rico, Minnesota, California, 
Fort Wayne, New York, 
Wisconsin and even Greece. 

A team which would be a 
melting pot and might not 
have good chemistry has been 
pooled together by coaching 
icon Amie Ball to do one thing 
and that is v,in. 

Coming here and being a 
student you might not know 
what all of the hype is about; 
however, coming here and 
watching them pound =1- 
ranked Lewis, beat both Pcnn 



State and Ohio State, and then 
come to the Coliseum and see 
them crush Southern Cal you 
start to understand what we 
have here at IPFW, 

The volleyball program is 
one that will never gain the 
attention it deserves from the 
communit&gt;' and even the stu- 
dents here on campus. 

However. both The 
Journal Gazette and the News- 
Sentinel are doing great jobs 
covering the team. 

But until 've, as students, 
start coming out and support- 
ing this team night in and 



night out, we are never going 
to believe the hype. 

In an interview with 
Athletic Director Walter 
Bowman earlier this year, he 
said, "Come and check us out; 
see what we have to offer. 1 
promise wc will earn your 
respect and you will be glad 
jou came." 

1 am backing Bowman's 
guarantee, and folks, it's not 
just this team, but all of the 
programs here on campus, 

I hope you take time to 
come out and support your 
team)'!

The IPFW Men's Baseball team has twentj- 
iwo games under its belt. Twent)'-two impor- 
tant games at that. 

Head coach Tony Vittorio knew it would 
be lough. In those games the team combined 
for an 11-11 overall record. 

In the eyes of the average fan, this record 
would be mediocre. However, Vittorio's team 
has played ranked opponents from game num- 
ber one. 

As a coach. Vittorio believes in the philos- 
ophy "to be the best you have to beat the best" 
and that is the attitude he expects his players 
to have as well. 

That is exacth what he did when he 



scheduled Lincoln Memorial and Carson 
Newman on the Schedule as well as Lindsey 
Wilson. 

This season so far has been one of streaks: 
the team lost its first three, won its next four. 
lost its next two, won its next two, lost its next 
two. then won five out of six before losing in 
its last three games. 

The Dons have proven that they can put 
runs on the board in a hurr&gt;', scoring 19 runs 
twice this season and scoring over 10 runs five 
times this season. 

Pitching has been a problem for the Dons. 
Their ace Matt Erpelding hasn't had run sup- 
port, and the others haven't been playing up 
to their potential. 

With some luck and good fortune, this 
team will be able to make good of its losses, 
and turn this se.ison into a positive experience.

He Conquered Death. 

Do You Think He Might Know 

Something About Life? 

It wasn't difficult for God to take on human flesh. What was difficult was what 

He did as a man. He was crucified for our sins. But then He rose from the 

dead. He now offers us new life in Him through forgiveness of sin and a 

relationship with Him. 

If you have any questions about Jesus Christ and His relevance for your life, 

ask one of us or see Tell Me More(www.leaderu.com/TellMeMore).
