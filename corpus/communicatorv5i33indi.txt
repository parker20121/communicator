April 1 is deadline for 
financial aid application 



The deadline for Indiana-Purdue 
students to file for financial aid is 
April 1. 1974. 

The financial aid program here 
exists to help students who need 
assistance in financing their college 
education, and to recognize students 
of high academic abitlity. 



Marx to be 
debate subject 



The philosophic founder of Com- 
munist empires, Karl Marx, has been 
adored, loathed, studied and ignored 
for the past 134 years. His master 
work Das Kapital competes with the 
Bible in the number of translations. 

Anyone wishing to know more about 
this philosophic giant and his ideas is 
invited to the debate organized by 
Center for the Study of the Person and 
the Indiana-Purdue philosophy de- 
partment March 15 at 7:30 p.m. in 
Room 146 of Kettler hall. 

The debate is titled "What is living 
and dead in the ideas of Marx." 

One of the two debators will be 
William McBride of the Purdue-Laf- 
ayette philosophy department. He is a 
specialist on Marx and will explore 
Marxism as a perspective on 
contemporary political, social and 



The university expects each student 
to pay a realistic contribution to all of 
his educational costs, the amount 
being determined by use of either the 
Parents Confidential Statement or 
the Students Financial Statement of 
the College Scholarship Service. 

The financial aids office, headed by 
Bill Arnold and his assistant Joan 
Eaton, tries to meet the demonstrated 
financial needs of students who apply 
through scholarships, grants, loans, 
and part-time employment. 

Scholarships are awarded on the 
basis of high school records, Scho- 
lastic Aptitude Test scores, and 
demonstrated financial need. Two 
specific scholarship programs offered 
on campus are the State Scholarship 
Program and the Child-Of-Disabled 
Veteran award. 

Several grants are available inclu- 
ding the Basic Opportunity Grant, 
university grants, Educational Op- 
portunity Grants, Federal nursing 



grants, law enforcement grants, and 
Vocational Rehabilitation Grants. 

Loans that may be obtained through 
this office are the National Direct 
Student Loan, nursing loans, and law 
enforcement loans. 

Another program is based on the 
work-study concept. Students work a 
maximum of 15 hours per week on 
campus while classes are in session. 
This program is supported by the 
Federal government and gives 
priority to low-income families. 

Those students desiring part-time 
work off campus may apply at the 
Placement office. Room 111 of the 
Student Union. 

Students who receive any type of 
financial aid through the university 
must reapply each year for renewal of 

More information may be obtained 
in the financial aids office, Room 210 
of the Student Union. 



The other debator will be Curt 
Peters who teaches philosophy at 
Concordia Senior College. Peters 
recently returned from a tour of 
Europe, including the Communist 
countries, where he went chiefly to 
interview Marxist philosophei 



Finally, Richard Sokolowski, a 
former IU-PU french professor, will 
inquire briefly in to whether there is 
anything specifically Marxist about 
Polish society. 

The panel of respondents to the 
speakers will include William Lee, a 
Fort Wayne attorney. Lee is sched- 
uled to teach a course on philosophy 
of conservatism at IU-PU in the near 

The panel will also include Julius 
Smulkstys of the political science 
department. Smulkstys has just 
published a book on Marxism. 

The evening will be moderated by 
Clark Butler of the philosophy 
department. Butler will be teaching a 
seminar entitled "Marx and Freud" 
in the fall. 




Streaking fad hits 
Fort Wayne area 



Streaking has finally come to Fort 
Wayne as city police received 
numerous reports of naked runners 
over the week-end. 

The first known case of streaking 
involved DGTS student Mike Sim- 
mons. Simmons streaked on the Phil 
Gardner Friday morning radio show. 

Gardner had requested that streak- 
ers come to the WLYV studios to 
prove that Fort Wayne was not 
"chicken city." Simmons was the 
first to respond. 

Gardner said that his request for 
streakers produced "three honest-to- 
ness naked bodies." Gardner was 
upset that none of the three were 
female. 

The super-jock said that he would 
probably not request streakers on his 
Saturday show. "I think I'll let it 



Rumors were also circulating that a 
group of Concordia High School 
syudents were signing up for a 
Saturday streaking episode on the 
IU-PU campus, but the streakers did 
not show up. 

John Ulmer, associate dean for 
student services, said that no definite 
policy exists for dealing with 
streakers. Ulmer safd that safety and 
security has been requested to refer 
any streaking information to his 



office for furthur action. 

Ulmer said that he was primarily 
concerned about crowd control. He 
indicated that each incident would be 
dealt with as the situation warrants. 

"I think people are asking for 
trouble to bring in the police and the 

Ulmer said that action would be 
taken only if the streaking incident 
jeopardizes the orderly operation of 
the university. 









He would not rule out doing it again 
some other time in the near future. He 
said his next request for streakers 
would come unexpectedly. 

Gardner also told the Communlca- 
torthat he had received a phone call 
from a frustrated streaker who had 
been thwarted in his attempt to dash 
naked across the fndiana-Purdue 
campus. 

The caller, who did not identify 
himself, said that he changed his 
mind about streaking IU-PU when a 
number of police made an appear- 
ance on his proposed course. 

According to the Office of Safety 
and Security, no city police were 
known to be on campus Friday 
morning. 

Requests 
health plan 

WASHINGTON (FCNS)-Acting 
at the request of President Nixon, 
Reps. Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) and 
Herman T. Schneebeli &lt;R-Pa.), the 
chairman and ranking minority 
member of the House Ways and 
Means Committee, introduced his 
national health insurance plan into 
the House. 

Caspar W. Weinberger, secretary 
of health, education, and welfare, 
refused to estimate the total cost of 
the plan. But HEW sources indicated 
it would be nearly $40 billion. 

Cosmetics risky 

An analysis of 1,031 samples of 
used eye cosmetics from 460 women 
showed 512 contaminated by bacteria 
and 155 by fungi, posing an increased 
risk of bacterial or fungal infection 
for women who use eye cosmetics, 
says Dr. Louis A. Wilson, professor of 
ophthalmology, Emory University of 
Medicine. 

Dr. Wilson points out risk of 
infection could be reduced if women 
replaced mascara brushes frequent- 
ly, threw away old cosmetics and did 
not share cosmetics with others.

trails, according to Dave Vervalin, 
associate city planner. The paths will 
be on-street in design and will 
eventuallly criss-cross the Fort 
Wayne. 

The paths will be constructed by 
either banning parking on one side of 
the selected city streets or by pushing 
the traffic lanes closer together. It is 
hoped that Federal revenue sharing 
will be used to help get the $2000 a 
mile project started, with added 
funding coming from increases in the 
cost of bicycle license plates. 



where the bulk of the riders 
going," said Vervalin. 
"We will upgrade the paths we hi 



and begin to build nev 
to ridership demand." 

Preliminary figures show that the 
bulk of the ridership is toward 
downtown or the parks. According to 
these figures, IU-PU is toward the top 
of the list for a trail of its own. 

Vervalin was hesitant to give an 
estimate of when such a trail would be 
built because his figures are still 
incomplete and funding is uncertain. 

'What we hope to do is build a 
north-south network and an east-west 
one to converge on downtown. We will 
implement a couple as soon as is 
possible and then complete the rest as 
we receive funding." 

The city is aslo looking into a 
bike-bus arrangement. Under this 
plan, there would be lockers for 
bicycles located near major Public 

Transportation Corporation bus 
lines. The bike rider could leave his 



s and take

More on the leak 



The Chancellor Search and Screen Committee reconvenes today to 
continue its consideration of applications for the job of super-chancellor. 
Undoubtedly, the discussion will center on something else, the matter of 
information leaks. 

Last week, the Journal-Gazelle was given information about the 
status of two of the "affiliated" candidates. This information was very 
accurate, as it gave the vote count and a breakdown on who voted how. 
This is significant because the vote was by secret ballot. 

The leak is obviously someone on the committee. The information 
getting out is much too accurate for it to come from anyone but a 
committee member. 

And the information is getting out fast. Fifteen minutes after the last 
meeting, one faculty member who is not on the committee knew the 
outcome of the voting. The Communicator had pieced the entire story 
together by that evening. 

Search and screen committees must operate in complete secrecy. 
They are dealing with the careers of professional educators and 
aministrators. Sensitive information that leaks out can damage these 

The super-chancellor committee members were charged with 
secrecy in their task. At least one of these people has not lived up to this 
responsibility. 

The committee cannot blame the Journal-Gazette for printing the 
story. The Communicator did not publish the information because it is 
part Of the IU-PU family. The Journal-Gazette is not; therefore, its duty 
to keep its readers informed over-rides any obligation to protect the 
committee. This paper would have done the same if il 
publication. 

The committee had better plug its leak before qualified candidates 
withdraw for fear of breach of confidence. 



Basketball woes 



How can a team with inferior coaching, an absence of a big man, no 
scholarships, dilficull opposition, a rigid schedule that calls for it to play 
2tlgamesontheroad, and a lack of student bodv support help but to have 
a 5-23 record? 

The 1973-1 Mastodon basketball team did have a 5-23 record, and it 
did indeed possess every single one of these problems during the season. 

The coaching this year was something else. When the head coach 
takes the team captain out of the ball game because he called a needed 
timeout, there is definitely something wrong. There were approximately 
li() different starling combinations used in the 28 games for the Mastodons 
this year. This is an example of impatient and indecisive coaching, which 
can and did lose more games than the players lost. 

A big man (6'7") planned to join the team in (he second semester, but 
he was discouraged by the head coach. 

Not one member of the Indiana-Purdue squad was receiving an 
athletic scholarship, but it was not uncommon to see the opposition 
having their entire team supported with scholarships. 

Not only was IU-PU scheduled against teams out of its class, but it 
also had the wonderful opportunity to pay two-thirds of its games away 
from home. Several stronger schools actually paid IU-PU to come and 
play them in their home openers. The IU-PU athletic department 
undoubtedly figured it could make some money on these losses. 

The following for the team (like usual) was pathetic, but this is 
almost understandable, as the off-campus facilities are the primary basis 
for lack of interest. 

Until the athletic department gets down to business by getting a good 
coach, offering scholarships, and organizing a realistic schedule, the 
Mastodon cagers will continue to have disappointing seasons.

Prophets looked to for guidance

How often have you felt troubled? 
Fearful? Alone? We're living in a day 
which many have identified as a crisis 
period. We wonrter, "Where are we 
headed? What does the future hold n " 

But our desire to know the future 
is nothing new. Men and women have 
always consulted the prophets, 
priests and magicians for words of

is 100 per cent. In fact, the Bible says 
that any man speaking as a prophet 
who predicts something which does 
not come to pass is not a prophet at 
all. &lt;Dt. 18:21,22) God considers this a 
very serious matter, and the Old 
Testament punishment for such an 
offense was death. (Dt. 18:20). 

Did you know there is one source 
of prophecy which contains the words 
of God's true prophets throughout the 
centuries! This source is the Bible, 
and its prophecies have been 100 per 
cent accurate. Let's take a moment to 
consider some of them. 

700 years before the birth of 
Christ, the prophet Isaiah wrote of ;

According to Isaiah, the one sent 
from God would be beaten beyond re- 
cognition (Isaiah 52:14) after being 
rejected by the Jewish people. Isaiah 
teus us that the world Savior would 
stand silent before his accusers, die 
beside criminals, and be buried in a 
rich man's grave (Isaiah 53). Jesus 
Christ fulfilled all of these prophecies 
700 years later! 

The prophet Micah, a contempo- 
rary of Isaiah, prophesied the 
Savior's birthplace, the town of 
Bethlehem. (Micah 5:1-2, Mathew 
2:5,6). In the sixth century B.C., 
Zeehariah accurately prophesied 
Jesus Christ's Palm Sunday entry 
into Jerusalem (Zech. 9:9). Zeehari- 
ah, like the prophets before him saw 
the rejection of Christ. In fact, the old 
prophet even foretold the exact price 
Judas received for his betrayal of 
Jesus. (Zech. 11:12,13).

One of the most astounding 
prophecies in the Bible can be found 
in Psalm 22. This Psalm, penned by 
King David of Israel, ca. 1000 B.C., 
gives us a graphic picture of death by 
crucifixion (See vs. 14-17), and even

man. The total accuracy of Bible 
prophecy is beyond human capabili- 
ties , and it gives us a small idea of 
God's great mind. The coming of 
Jesus Christ as Messiah and his 
rejection by God's prophets. "But 
what does this mean to me today?" 
you may ask. 

To view the immediate relevancy 
of Bible prophecy, let us first look to 
the writings of Moses. Writing 
between 1450 and 1410 B.C., Moses 
prophesied a day when the Jewish 
people would be scattered out into 
every nation of the world. Their 
unbelief and disobedience to God was 
to cause this dispersion (Dt. 28:63-68) . 
Moses said they would be mistreated 
everywhere they went. Jesus Christ 
referred to this as a time when the 
Jews would be trodden down by 
Gentile (non-Jew) world powers. 
(Luke 21:20-24). The fulfillment of 
this prophecy has been Jewish history 
since 70 AD. At that time Titus and 
the Roman legions destroyed Jerusa- 



Jesus Christ Himself proclaimed 
that Israel and Jerusalem would once 
again be under Jewish control. In 
fact, he made it very clear that such 
would be the case when He returned

The second coming of Jesus 
Christ is one of the major themes of 
the Bible. It is referred to in at least 21 
of the 39 Old Testament books, and 24 
of the 27 New Testament books. There

(Ezek. 36:21-24).

THE END TO WILLIAM HARBELL 

Several weeks ago this writer commented at some length 
on the perverted antics of the varsity basketball coach at 
Morehead State (Kentucky), Bill Harrell. He sent only his 
reserves to Illinios to take on Illinois State, keeping his 
starters at home to rest up for future conference tilts. 

The ensuing controversy received much attention across 
the nation, effectively making the last few weeks for 
Harrell a total nightmare. First of all, his well-rested 
starters lost the Ohio Valley conference championship that 
he so coveted as a result of a 93-82 thrashing they absorbed 
at the hands of conference titlist Austin Peay. 

And then, about a week ago, Harrell was forced to resign. 
He had had big dreams of becoming a great college and 
maybe even a great professional basketball mentor. But 
those dreams were undoubtedly shattered as a result of his 
forced resignation. 

That, students, is what one gets sometimes when one 
steps all over the other guy to get his piece of glory. We now 
move to Wilt Chamberlain. 

WILT THE STILT DOES FEEL NO GUILT 

In his glory days in the NBA, Mr. Chamberlain was known 
to step on a lot of people, both on and off the court. He was 
his own man who always did what he wanted, when he 
wanted. If his coach got in the way, then his coach would be 
fired. If a player even whispered discontent, Wilt would 
turn into Buccolic Buffalo and say, "Me non likum little 
man. Me hatum duts. Me takum foot and stomp little mans 
and makim go away." And he'd do just that. 

But this year the big man decided that it wasn't any fun 
anymore stomping on just one or two men at a time. He 
would take on the whole NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers 
team and stomp them all out at once. What fun it would be! 

He was already making more money than he was worth in 
L.A. but asked for a tripling of pay. Why should he worry if 
Jerry West and Gail Goodrich and Company would be 
forced to play for pennies as long as he garnered a cool 
$300,000? Let them tend their own gardens. 

The champion Lakers could not afford to meet his absurd 
demands and neither could the San Antonio Spurs of the 
ABA. But Wilt was so nice in visiting the Spurs' 
management and having tea that they thought it would be 
nice to have him play and coach their for their team. 

So they blindly succumbed to his offer to play and coach 
for $500,000 a year. He thus jumped the NBA and his 
contract with the world champion Lakers. 

The Lakers took the matter to court and received little 
consolation or revenge: a court order prohibited 
Chaimberlain from playing with any other team during the 
1973-74 campaign. 

Consequently he is now just the coach of the San Antonio 
Spurs of the American Basketball Association, making 
double the money all the team players receive put together ! 

Now one would think that, upon receiving that unheard of 
sum of money, anyone, even Wilt Chamberlain, would try 
his best to earn it. But then there are times when one must 
stop and think again. 

Two weeks ago Wilt decided that a vacation would be 
nice. The team was battling for a playoff spot, but Wilt 
thought it would be nice to take a vaction. 

He didn't tell the management; he didn't tell the players; 
and he didn't tell the fans. The assistant coach took over and 
the management remained silent. 

In a few days Wilt returned. He didn't see any reason to 
explain his absence to the management, players, or the 
press. So he remained silent, and since he felt like it, 
resumed his duties as pro basketball coach. The 
management welcomed him back. 

This kind of behavior can, under no circumstances, be 
condoned in any professional sport. The league should have 
suspended and fined Chamberlain (something like $20,000) 
for his blatant desertion of his team. Better yet, the 
management of the Spurs should have walloped with the 
fine for not taking action against Chamberlain. 

But Wilt is the prized asset of the crazed league. He is just 
what the ABA needs in its battle with the established NBA.

you'll select Ona.. 
If you don't compare, 
don't say we didn't warn you!
