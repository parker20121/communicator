1300 parkers receive tickets 



180 appeal 



By MARK PARKER 

Approximalely 1,300 tickets (or 
illegal parking at IPFW have been 
issued this semester, with the majority 
steming from improper parking in 
landscaped areas, along yellow curbs 
and on the grass. 

Of the tickets received, about 80 have 
been appealed to the IPFW Traffic 



Appeals Board, said Norm Greenburg, 
chairman of that board. He 
hypothesized that it seemed possible 
most people realized they were in 
violation and are just taking the con- 
sequences. 

Those recieving tickets and ap- 
pealing Ihem most often give a lack of 
available parking spaces as their 




reason for the illegal parking. Many 
also said the available spaces were too 
far from their campus destinations, 

Greenburg and Maurice Shady, chief 
of the campus police, emphasized the 
availability of spaces in the lots north of 
the Wall} Memorial Union. 

The complaint with these lots is their 
distances from Kettler and Neff halls, 
said Greenburg, who pointed out that 
the walk from the farthest lot on 
campus is still less than or comparable 
to the distances walked on the main 
campuses of most universities. 

Shady attributes part of the un- 
popularity of these lots to a sort of 
cultural shock. With new students 
coming' from high schools, and other 



students used to local shopping centers 
where they are able to park close to the 
buildings, they are finding that if they 
don't arrive on campus early, they have 
to walk a greater distance than they are 
usedtowalking. 

All parking problems have been 
intensified by the increases in 
enrollment, but the parking places are 
available in sufficient numbers. Shady 
and Greenburg insist, A total of more 
than 2,800 spaces are on the campus, 
including the 374 reserved for those 
with "A" permits. 

It seems, then, that some students 
are going to have to get up earlier or 
walk farther than they may be ac- 
customed to walking.

Sandstrom, Provost return 



By JIM CHAPMAN 
A lack of time to devote to both 

Students' Government and personal 
studies is the major reason given by 
three senators who resigned from the 
IPFW Student Senate recently. 

The resignations of senators Scott 
Kuehn and Dwight Fish were effective 
Oct. 30, Jeff Sandy's resignation will 
become effective pending the com- 
pletion of several projects in which he's 
currently involved. 

Also recently resigning from the 
Senate was Matt Bonahoom, Senate 
president and student body vice- 
president. He cites an increase in 
personal responsibilities as his reason 
for resigning now instead of in 
December as originally planned. 



Bonahoom will graduate in 
Decemtier. 

Replacing Bonahoom as vice- 
president of the student body and 
president of the Senate is Steve 
Westrick. 

"I'm sorry about the senators that 
have resigned," Westrick said, "They 
were good workers and they will be 
missed. I am looking forward to being 
student body vice-president," 

Sandy, whose resignation was to have 
been announced at last night's Senate 
meeting, also cited among his reasons 
for resigning that the loss of Bonahoom 
as the head of the Senate was a personal 
loss to him. 

He suggested that the Senate job 
might not be as personally fulfilling to 
him without Bonahoom at the helm. 



The dalai lama hosts visitors 



By HELEN BUSCHEY 

After centuries shrouded in secrecy, 
Tibet is inviting scholars to come and 
study its people, so that it may be 
recorded, and a history of its culture 
preserved. 

It was at the invitation of the dalai 
lama — the god king of Tibet who is a 
reincarnation of the Buddha of Com- 
passion — that Paul Provost, and Alan 
Sandstrom, assistant professors of 
anthropology at IPFW, journeyed ±o the 
other side of the earth this summer to 
begin their study. 

They were accompanied on the trip 
by Sandstrom's wife, Pamela, and 
Peter H, Gold, curator of collections, 
Indiana University Museum of 
Anthropology , History and Folklore. 

After a flight to NeW Delhi, a 24-hour 
train trip and a four-hour bus ride, they 
arrived at a place called Dharamsala, 
on the Indo-Tibetian border of North 
India, It is here the dalai lama lives in 
exile with his followers. 

To explain the remoteness of this land 
at "theroof of the world," the following 
is a brief geographical background. 

Before 1951, Tibet was an 
autonomous province of the Peoples 
Repubhc of China, formerly con- 
stituting an independent state. It is 
bounded on the north and east by China, 
on the south by the Republic of India, 
Bhuten and Nepal, and in the west by 
Kashmir and India. 

It is enclosed on three sides by the 
vast mountains of the Himalayas, 
which Provost said are extremely 
beautiful. Because of the impossible 
character of its natural barriers, Tibet 
is one of the most isolated regions of the 
world. It is also the most elevated, 
having an average elevation of more 
than 12,000 feet, Tibet has a land area 
greater than the size of Europe and a 
population of 6.000,000. 

Hidden by the 29,028 foot peak of 
Mount Everest, and other equally 
awesome heights, only a handful of 
outsiders had ever been in Tibet before 
1950, They had few contacts with the 
world, and when the Chinese invaded 
the country in Ihe early 1950's, the dilai 
lama asked the United Nations for help. 
but his appeal was ignored. In 1959. the 
dalia lama fled into exile with 100,000 of 
his followers. 

Provost explained the purpose of the 
trip., was to see what studies could be 
done and to make contacts. They did 
not go with the intention of solving 
problems, but just as a study out of the 
Anthropology department at IPFW, 

Provost and Sandstrom are trying to 
interest other scholars in going to Tibet 
to do similar studies like theirs in 
desciplines such as musical traditions 
and art, the monasteries and the 
political system. Tibetian art is 
especially noteworthy, and could be 
described as 'contemplative* art. 

Eventually, they hope to apply for a 



"Christians think you are born esentiolty sinful, 
and that you must save yourself: the Buddbas 
think you are born enlightened and that you are 
esentially good. " Alan Sandstrom. 



large grant and go back with a team of 
researchers. They already have the 
permission of the dalai lama. 

This summer, Provost and Sand- 
strom did what they described as 
participant observation, living with the 
people and taking part in their rituals. 
They were looking at certain areas of 
Tibetian life, ,, their social life and 
t&gt;eliefs. 

They collected sociological data, took 
a census, recorded music and met with 
many of the original people of Tibet, 
including men in monasteries and 
Buddhist nuns, and had an audience 
with the dalai lama. They even tried to 
learn the Tibetian language, which 
Sandstrom described as "really 
complicated." 

"The Tibetian people are robust and 
tall," Provost said, "and are healthy 
from lots of exercise and the clear 
mountain air. 

According to Sandstrom, the dress of 
the people varies. Some, especially the 
young, have adopted western jeans and 
T-shirts. Others still wear the 
traditional "chuba," a dark woUen 



cloak, belted below the waist with folds 
above the waist, that serve as pockets. 

Provost pointed out that the trip was 
not like going to the Amazon or into a 
primitive culture, just into a different 
tradition. The Tibetians have a long 
literary history and are known for their 
education based on mastering a 
knowledge of psychology and 
philosophy. They live in cities, have 
debates, and it is not uncommon to 
meet people who speak five languages. 
Everyone is multi-language. They read 
Time and Newsweek, and know all tof 
the U.S.' old TV shows such as "I Love 
Lucy." the best modern rock music is 
played on the radio stations. 

Tibet is ruled by a theocracy, which 
means they are ruled by Gods, not 
people. To understand Tibet, one must 
also understand their religion. 

"Democracy is not seen as a way to 
rule," Sandstrom explained, "and it 
presents a totally different way to look 
at society. We don't have any living 
Gods. Our Gods are all up in the sky, 
while theirs are walking around on the 
street."

Provost examine some of the items they brought back from Tibet. The three lived 
in the country as participant observers this summer. (Photo by Julie Zent) 



"Some of us are clouded with 
illusion," Sandstrom continued, "the 
purpose of Buddha is to uncloud your 
vision. Christians think you are born 
essentially sinful, and that you must 
save yourself; the Buddhas think you 
are born enlightened and that you are 
essentially good," 

"If we were to compare Toman 
Catholicism and Buddhism, the 
hierarch is much the same, except that 
the Pope is a bridge to the deity, while 
the dalai lama is the deity himself." 

Tibet does not mind people of other 
religions in its country. They have had 
Muslims, Hindus and Christians, All 
are welcome, and have been for cen- 
turies. The religions look different, but 
the Tibetian believes that the goal of all 
is the same. What is important is for a 
man to live by his belief and to be a 
good and honest person. 

Provost and Sandstrom are going to 
exhibit their slides in the Helmke 
Library, and have made plans for a 
Tibetian Fair, November 14th and isth. 

Thubten Norbu, older brother of the 
dalia lama, who now lives and teaches 
at lU Bloomington, and who just 
returned from Tibet himself, will speak 
and give a slide showing on the 15th. 

They will also show two films on 
Tibet; one on the Hollywood film, "Lost 
Horizons," which by the way, is the 
original Shangrila film starring Ronald 
Coleman; and the other, an 
ethnographic, BBC film called the 
"Lama King," about the dalia lama. 

Asked if they would like to go back to 
Tibet, Provost and Sandstrom both 
affirmed they are hoping it will be 
possible. 

"From the anthropological point of 
view, you go somewhere and you hold 
back your judgments, but this was the 
most exciting, intellectwally 
stimulating thing I've been exposed 
to." Provost said. 

He then told a story about a cave 
dweller whom they met shortly before 
they returned to New York, The cave 
dweller gave Provost and Sandstrom 
packets of sacred seeds that he said he , 
had been chanting over for two years. 

They were to wear the seeds in 
amulets that hung from their necks, 
and in the event of bad luck or some 
misfortune, they were to throw the 
seeds into a fire, and the seeds would 
relase powerful demons that would help 
them on their way again. 

The men forgot about Ihe magical 
seeds until they reached customs, and 
while Ihey were being searched, they 
tjegan to fear not only for what the 
seeds might actually be, but also that 
the seeds might be confiscated and rob 
them of a very special gift. 

It was with a sigh of relief, they left 
customs, the seeds in their amulets, 
unnoticed. Apparently the demons had 
one their intended work. 




Lou^s proud 
of her work 

"Lou Waldron is an invaluable member of the 
department. . . . Her wif and charm make the 
English office a pleasurable place." Henry 
Kozicki, chairman of ihe English department. 



Bv SANDRA WILEY 

Behind every successful depart- 
ment, there's a good secretary. 
Anyway, that's the consensus of 
opinion of the professors and staff in 
IPFW's English department, where 
Lou Waldron serves as head 
secretary and office manager. 

"Lou Waldron knows the set up 
better than anyone else around, and 
she can steer you to the right in- 
formation," said Headings, a 
professor in the English depart- 
ment, "She goes way beyond what 
anyone can reasonably expect of a 
secretary," Headings added. 

Lou, as she prefers to be called, 
has been at IPFW almost 10 years, 
and nearly eight of those years have 
been in the English department . 

"I was hired as a temporary 
secretary for the search and screen 
committee that selected Sylvia 
Bowman as vice-chancellor of all the 
(I.U.) regional campuses," Lou said 
in a recent interview. That tem- 
porary job tiecame a permanent 
one. 

Lou has worked for education a 
big part of her life. She helped send 
her husband, Paul— now on engineer 
in communications at 

Magnavox— through college. She 
also helped two daughters obtain 
degrees in nursing and assisted a 
son in his forensic studies. 

Being in the Englisii department is 
a natural pace for Lou, who once had 
thoughts of being a writer. "Not just 
any kind of a writer," she said, "I 
wanted to be a foreign correspon- 
dent. I'd still love to take some 
classes/ maybe some Shakespeare. 
We have some really good 
Shakespeare teachers here, 

Lou doesn't regret becoming a 
secretary, however, and watching 
the students go by year after year. 
She's more or less content. She's 
mastered motherhood and she's got 
plenty at home to keep her busy;' 
growing plants, sewing, playing the 
organ, cooking and painting are just 
some ofher hobbies, 

"I've never been ashamed of 
being a secretary," she said, "I 
know some people say I'm just a 
secretary. But I've never felt that 
way." 

Lou says she does a good job— and 
therefore enjoys her work. 

From all accounts, she has reason 
to be proud. 

"Lou Waldron is an invaluable 
member of the department," said 
Henry Kozicki, chairman of the 
Enghsh department. "She is hard 
working, organized and an effective 
presence, in the same way that an 
effective faculty member is a strong 
presence. She makes the depart- 
ment's machinery function properly 
and efficiently. 



"Over the years, she has come to 
learn all about IPFW, and the 
faculty, students and I have learned 
to tap her expertise. 

Her wit and charm make the 
English office a pleasurable place," 

Being head secretary of the 
English department Is no easy task. 
Although directly responsible to 
Kozicki, Lou is secretary to the 18 
full-time, 35 part-time and seven 
graduate-assistant professors of 
that department, 

Lou is quick to point out that she 
doesn't do all the work herself, "Deb 
Feasel is my right arm," she said, 
"and Vicki Benecke and Connie 
Muck help too." 

As the department's office 
manager, Lou has many respon- 
sibilities, including keeping track of 
everyone's schedules and keeping 
the paper work flowing smoothly 
through the department. 

Perhaps her busiest times occur 
during fall and spring registrations 
when students bombard the 
department with phone calls and 
visits and professors pile on extra 
work. 

What is the secret of her success? 

"I live by the motto of keeping my 
head when others all around me are 
losing theirs," Lou said. 

Adding to her work load is a little- 
known service to the community 
that is provided by the English 
department. "People call the 
university English department for 
all kinds of information. They think 
that's where they can get the 
straight scoop," Lou said. 

Such calls include asking for 
correct spellings of words, authors' 
names, quotations and information 
about most everything else. 

More than one person has called 
and asked, "How do you write a 
book?" Lou claimed. She said that 
she suggested to one man that he 
start by taking a creative wxiling 
course at IPFW, and thai such a 
class would be starting soon. 
"Mam," the man replied to the 
suggestion, "by that time, I'll done 
haveil wrote," 

Lou is full of interesting antidotes 
about things that have happened in 
her work, and that's one of the 
reasons she loves her job- her op- 
portunity to meet many different 
people, "Personalities intrigue me," 
she said, "There's no one I can say I 
dislike or don't gel along with." 

And the people she's around daily 
like Lou. "She's not jusi an 
associate, she's a friend," said 
Headings, "She can always cope 
with situations. She solves problems 
tor students and frequently gives 
good advice," 

Lou Waldron is not— JUST- a 
secretary. Just ask her

Another resignation 



&gt; Two weeks ago at Ihe joint faculty- 
'senate meeting, the Vice-Chancelior and 
Dean of the Faculty, Edward Nicholson, 
announced the resignation of Linda and 
■ Ken Balthaser, the husband and wife 
team who serve as co-direclors of 
Weeltend College. 

Ken and Linda deserve a sustained 
round of applause for their services to 
that program. 

The Balthasers helped to launch 
Weeitend College last year. Since then, 
-enrollment in the Saturday and Sunday 
classes has risen 4B percent. In addition, 
students and professors alike seem to be 
enjoying this educational venture, and 
administrators at the mother campuses 
seem lo be watching the program wilh 



interest and approval.. 

Thanks to Ken and Linda. 

Bui now, the Balthasers have settled 
back into their full-time duties. Ken will 
be devoting all of his energies to 
directing the Learning Resource Center, 
and Linda continues as assistant to the 
Dean of Arts and Letters. Bette Worley. 
who currently serves as assistant to the 
Vice-chancellor, will replace the 
Balthasers as director of Weekend 
College. 

We don't know why Ken and Linda 
resigned. What we do know, however, is 
thai they did one hell of a job with 
Weekend College. 

Thanks Linda and Ken,

The one eternal truth in 
financial aid is thai there are 
no eternal truths. 

Because so much of the 
financial aid funding IPFW 
has available is provided by 
federal tax dollars, we are 
continually subjected lo the 
changing political scene in 
Washington. Sludenls musi 
learn to contend with years 
of plenty and years that are 



lean, intermixed in 
seemingly random order. 
The 1978-81 period is no 
exception to this rule. 

In the years up to and 
including 1978-79, federal 
financial assistance was 
targeted primarily to the 
lower class and lower middle 
class populations. 

Institutional policies 
generally agreed wilh this 
prioritization. 

Bui the rapid rise in in- 
flation was taking a heavy 



toll on the discretionary 
income of the middle 
classes, and Congress 
resolved to do something 
at&gt;out the decreasing access 
lo college for students from 
these families. 

The Middle Income 
Student Assistance Act of 
1978 (MISA) was the 
solution. The Basic 
Educational Opportunity 
Grant program &lt;BEOG) was 
opened up to families in the 
(15,000-25,000 range. Also, 
income limitations were 
removed from the 
Guaranteed Student Loan 
program (GSL) so that any 
student could borrow 
educational funds interest 
tree until he finished school.

The truth about financial aid 



the loal aid to IPFW students 
increased from (1,557,000 in 
1978-79 to (2,519.000 in 1979- 
80. A good year for IPFW 
students. 

All expectations were that 
1980-81 would he even better. 
II is true that 1980-81 will be 
another record selling year 
in terms of dollars awarded 
(projeclfed to be (3,500,000) 
and number of students 
helped (about 2.400), but 
these increases obscure 
three major dislocations of 
dollars to eligible applicants. 
— The U.S. Departmentof 
Education modified its 
eligibility formula lo give 
fuller consideration lo Ihe 
student's income. Basically. 
a student who is dependent 
on his parents (ap- 
proximately 68 percent of 
IPFW financial aid ap- 
plicants) and earned more 
than S2,650 in 1979 stands 
virtually no chance of being 
eligible for BEOG in 1980-81. 
While there are a number oE 
exceptions to this 

generalization, we have 
estimated that 313 students 
will lose their BEOGs en- 
tirely and that an additional 
unknown number will 
receive less. This formula 
change, even though it af- 



fects fewer than 5 percent of 
all students nationally, 
disproportionately penalizes 
IPFW students, 80 percent of 
whom hold jobs during the 
academic year. 

— The SUte Student 
Assistance Commission of 
Indiana (SSACI) wfls forced 
to reduce maximum award 
levels in its Educational 
Grant program because it 
did not have enough funds to 
fully award all eligible ap- 
plicants. Although some of 
this cutback was restored in 
August, IPFW sludenls still 
lost $155,000 in tuition 
assistance grants. 

— For the first time in 
years, SSACI was forced lo 
adhere lo its published ap- 
plication deadline of March 
1. In 1979-80, for instance, 
SSACI accepted applications 
into September and October. 
The Financial AJd Office 
mailed a deadline reminder 
to all Tmancial aid students 
last February, but there 
were still those who applied 
late only lo discover that this 
year too late meant too late. 
No estimate has been made 
on the number of students in 
Ihiscategory. '^-

Truth, cont. from 



page 2 



The Financial Aid Office 
has been faced with the 
problem of reconciling 
cutbacks in some programs 
with expansions in others, all 
the while dealing with a 
rapidly increasing pool of 
applicants. The numerous 
changes in the BEOG and 
SSACI payment schedules 
have caused equally 
numerous revisions by our 
office, with some students 
receiving as many as seven 
different financial aid award 
letters prior to the fall 
semester 

To recall a well worn an- 
ecdote, we forgot all about 
draining the swamp this 
summer. 

If we felt like we had 
reached the gates of hell, the 
students affected probably 
thought they were there and 
not scheduled for an early 
departure 

Receiving a succession of 
award letters, each changing 
the awards from the last, 
does not make for intelligent 
college financial planning. 
Worried and sometimes 
irate students and parents 
called daily, wondering if we 
were ever going to get it 
right. Others, no doubt, 
accepted the confusion 
stoically and assumed that 
each award letter would soon 
be replaced. 



Those were probably the 
lucky ones, though. A 
number of eligible students 
were told they would receive 
no awards at all or only 
partial funding. All in- 
stitutional funds, including 
College Work Study and 
National Direct Student 
Loan, were depleted furing 
or prior to May. 

Consequently, 68 eligible 
students received no aid at 
all and an additional 955 
have received less than they 
were eligible for. We have 
calculated the aggregate 
eligibility of our applicants 
to be in the neighborhood of 
$5,000,000, While we have 
available only about 
$2,000,000 to direct toward 
that need. 

We do not want to lose 
sight of the fact that sub- 
stantially more dollars are 
going to more students in 
1980^1 than ever before. In 
just two years the number of 
eligible students will have 
increased by 4I percent and 
the amount of total awards 
will be up be 125 percent. 

In spite of the real and 
human problems caused by 
the dislocations, more bucks

King novel bizarre 



ByMICHELE 
DeVlNNEV 

At a time when movies like 
"Halloween" and its sub- 
sequent ripoffs have people 
flocking to the theaters, it 
should be of no surprise Ihat 
"Firestarler," the new novel 
by Stephen King, is one of the 
best selling books in Fort 
Wayne, 

'■ Firestarler" is in King's 
usual mold of the super- 
natural, and it often reads 
like a rewrite of "Carrie. " 

The story focuses on a 
couple and its young child. 
Before they married, Andy 
and Vicki were involved in a 
drug experiment for an 
agency called "The Shop," 
Now their daughter, Charlie, 



can set her glance on 
something, and it goes up In 
flames. 

As was the case in 
"Carrie," the problems don't 
stem from Charlie's 
pyrokinesis alone, but also 
from her control of these 
powers and how she uses 
them to achieve her ultimate 
revenge. 

While he has an uncanny 
knack for tales Ihat paint a 
perfect picture of suspense. 
King's writing style is as 
bizarre and unnerving as his 
subject matter. 

Rather than starting the 
book at the beginning of the 
story, page one already has 
the readers right in the midst 
of chai-s. There's no lead-in

'Elephant Man' an 
unnerving movie 



By MIKE GEFFEN 

"The Elephant Man" is an 
unnerving film. 

The film works on two 
levels. At first, you squirm in 
your seat, recoiled by the 
shock of what you see on the 
screen. Once the shock has 
passed, you begin to relate to 
John Merrick as a man. and, 
more importantly, see him 
as a human being, and not as 
some grotesque figure. 

Those reactions are ex- 
actly what director David 
Lynch wants. The film is 
about the way society treats 
people who are different, and 
how the human spirit can 
endure anything. 

Lynch may tread the 
borderline of sensationalism 
in a few scenes, but it is to his 
credit that we are moVed. 
ultimately, by Merrick's 
plight, and are left with a 
sense of what Merrick was 
really like. 

"liie Elephant Man" tells 
the story of Merrick, who 
was disfigured at age 11 
after contracting 

neurofibromatosis, an In- 
curable disease. His head 
was hideously malformed, 
increased to more than twice 
its normal size, and asym- 
metrical. He was billed as 
the "Elephant Man" in 
sideshows because his head 
had a distended frontal bone, 
a trunklike appearance, and 
an almost-closed right eye. 



His right arm and hand were 
distorted to look like a club. 
He had folds of evil smelling 
flesh on his back. 

There has been a 
resurgence of interest in 
Merrick's life. The release of 
the film coincides with, and 
seeks to capitalize on, the 
Tony-winning Broadway 
play currently running with 
David Bowie as its star. All 
this renewed interest is 
enough to make one wonder 
if we aren't as bad as the 
people of Victorian England, 
staring at Merrick as though 
he was some sort of geek. 

The film, however, even 
though it has some distur- 
bing sensational scenes, 
erases that doubt. 

We ache and agonize over 
Merrick's plight. We are 
moved because of the level of 
the film's performances. 
John Hurt deserves an Oscar 
for his virtuoso per- 
formance. 

It's a challenge for an 
actor to be subdued by tons 
of/makeup, but Hart meets 
that challenge. He is 
un recognize able in the 
makeup, and uses that to his 
advantage. He makes us 
empathize with Merrick, 
because we see his tortured 
eyes and feel the pain he 
goes through. Hurt makes us 
see that there is a man, not 
an animal, behind the mask. 

Anthony Hopkins also 



gives a fine performance as 
Dr, Frederick Treves, the 
man who saves Merrick 
from the sideshow and gives 
him a home. Hopkins shows 
us a man who questions his 
motives, but who comes to 
respect and admire Merrick, 
Their friendship forms the 
core of the film, and both 
actors show depth in their 
characters.

for the action, and the 
readers have lo read several 
chapters before they can 
evoi begin to know what is 
happening. 

King also has two plots 
progressing at once, and it's 
hard lo follow the disjointed 
story line. The first chapter 
has the child and her father 
running frantically for an 
unexplained reason, while 
the following chapter jumps 
back lo the time of the drug 
experiment several years 
before. 

While his concept may be 
compelling and the book 
engrossing, hopping fromi 
one idea fragment to another 
for over lOO pages, and 
waiting for them to merge 
only serves lo confuse the

effect.

Play has broad appeal 



By MICHELE 
DEVINNEY 

The only failure of the 
Civic Theatre's presentation 
of Lorriane Hansberry's 
"Raisin in the Sun" is that 
it's waited this long to share 
the play with Fort Wayne. 

The play is one of the most 
powerful dramas of our 
time. Set in Chicago during 
the 1950's, it com- 
passionately portrays a 
black Family fighting (o 
survive the ghetto, 
disillusionment and broken 
dreams. 

Although the problems 
facing blacks In the Fifties 
are explored, "Raisin in the 
Sun" has a universal appeal 



that goes beyond black and 
white, male and female, 
young and old. Each 
character represents a 
dirfcrent human struggle. 

'Hie fine cast Is led by 
Gertrude Jcannetle. a 
Broadway, film and 
television actress who ap- 
pears through the support of 
the Indiana Arts Com- 
mission. 

Her portrayal of Lena 
Younger, the strong and 
determined matriarch, Is 
skilled and touching. 

The best performance 
comes from Anthony 
Belcher as Walter Lee 
Younger. His acting Is ex- 
tremely moving and nothing 



less than brilliant. 

The other actors, 
especially Karen R. 
Williams, are also ex- 
ceptional. With this much ■ 
talent, it's a shame the black -! 
actors in Fort Wayne have ''. 
been such an untapped 
resource. 

The directing, costuming 
and lighting are quite ef- 
fective. Robert Sandmaier's 
set is fairly good as well. The 
living room Is appropriate, 
but the brick wall in the 
background Is cluttered and 
distracting. 

Anyone who isn't sure if 
Ihey're Interested in this 
play, think again. No one 
should miss It.

By CHRIS PYLE 

"They're nol qiiillers.

Coach Peggy Voiain of the

Throughoul the season, the

Skill, not speed, is 
key cycling factor 



ByMIKEHOLLEV 

For the past 15 years, 
there has been a type of 
motor sport in the United 
Stales which denes all 
others, While speed and 
quickness are the prevailing 
alributes in most forms of 
motorized competition, 
Observed Trials molocycle 
competition test man and 
machine (or skill and ability 
where speed is nol a (actor. 

Observed Trials is the slow 
speed navigation around 
natural and man-made 
obstacles on specialty 
motorcycles. 

Trials originated In 
Europe after WWII. It 
developed and progressed 
there through the I950's, and 
was brought to the United 
States In the mid 1960'g. 

The Indiana Trials 
Association is the backbone 
of trials competition in 
Northern Indiana The 
association was started in 
1970 by a group o( motor- 
cycle enthusiasts, according 
to Gary Tope, one of the 
founding fathers In the 
years since ils inception, the 
club has promoted l)elween 
five and fifteen meets per 
years. 

The main grounds are 



located outside of Llgonier, 
Ind., north of Fori Wayne, 
but there are also meets held 
in Larwell. Corruna, New 
Paris, and anywhere ground 
is to ride on can be obtained. 
The events are held on 
Sundays, with aclivilies 
beginning at 11; 30 a.m.. and 
ending bel ween 4:00 and 5:00 
p.m. 

A trials event brings 
together a group of motor- 
cyclists to compele in def- 
ferent skill classes against 
pre-sel-up obstacle courses 
called sections. 

Each section is unique, 
varying from a steep, sandy, 
uphill climb, to a slippery, 
rock strewn creek bed. The 
rider follows a path through 
the section marked by small 
red and white flags 

The rider's objective is to 
ride through each section 
without slopping forward 
motion, going outside the 
flags or pulting a fool on Ihe 
ground. If any of these 
violalions occur, there are 
penally points assessed. 

Each rider carries a score 
card to keep (rack of his 
score. The card is marked at 
theendof each section by the 
section's checker, The 
checker is a person who 



watches each rider to see if 
any violations are com-

Riders compele in classes 
according to the skill they 
have demonstrated: novice, 
junior, senior and expert. 
When first starting to ride, a 
person would begin in the 
novice class Progression 
from one class to Ihe next is 
determined by how he places 
in competition against fellow 
riders. As the rider 
progresses, the complexity 
of the sections he rides in- 
creases. 

Engraved medals or 
trophies are presented as 
awards to the lop riders in 
each class after a day's 
event. 

Even though the sport 
involves slow speed, low 
decibel emission and 
minimal ecological impact, 
one of the association's 
biggest problems is finding 
places to ride. 

In a receni ruling by the 
Fort Wayne Park Board, an 
allempt lo sponsor a trials 
event on city park grounds 
during the 1981 Three Rivers 
Festival was vetoed. With 
their decision, members 
slated that although a trials 



even would probably not 
cause any problem, they did 
not wish to set a precedent 
for other more potentially 
destructive vehicle activity 
intheparks. 

Bob Arnold. park 
deportmenl director, later 
explained the ITA and other 
organizations' actions were 
not in vain The Park Board 
has recognized the need for 
an area where off-road 
events can take place. "The 
Park Department is Bt this 
time working on locating an 
area," Arnold said. "The 
future of off -road molorized 
recreation has come and we 
can't and don't want to 
ignore the needs of these 
people." 

The Fort Wayne Park 
Board and Park Department 
staff are doing all they can to 
help Any and all off-road 
enthusiasts are encouraged 
lo offer their support in 
locating and developing an 
area.
