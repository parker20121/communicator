technology 

fee 

referendum 



By Nol T. Bcckley 
Nem Editor 

SAB member Kerry A&lt;UdiLS pre- 
scnied his case aboui ibc technolo- 
gy fee referendum in from of the 
fPSGA Judicial Court on Tuesday, 
March 21. As reported in previous 
Communicaior articles, Adkins 
pelilioncd the court to investigate 
the legality of the rcrcrcndum on 
several points. 

One point Adkins contested was 
tbe original proposal approved by 
the IPSGA was not the one IPSGA 
President King returned with from 
the adminLstration. 

Another point Adkins made was 
many students did not receive the 
inframalion allegedly distributed to 
all students until after the informa- 
tional sessions concerning the refer- 
endum were held. Adkins claimed 
that several students never acquired 
any information concerning the 
technology fee referendum. 

"Ninety-three students did not 
receive the information pamphlet," 
stii Adkins. Adkins tlten submitted 
a petition with 93 signatures to the 
court.

New financial aid director 
seeks major improvement 
in processing, service 



Melissa Young-Flores 
Chief Reporter 

The Financial Aid Office may 
become mote efficient now that il 
has a Hnancial aid director. Bob 
Zellers became financial aid 
director on March 1. He had been 
the financial aid director at 
Southeast Missouri State 
Universily before coming to 
IPFW. 

"I was born and raised in 
Northern Indiana," Zellers said. "I 
was interested in getting back lo 
Indiana. IPFW is a good school 
and has a lot of potential." 

Accordmg lo Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Frank Borelli. 
Zellers was the unanimous choice. 
"He was the consensus candidate 
from all of those who interviewed 
and met him," Borelh said, 

Zelten; has already established 
a goal for the department "lo look 
careful at what we are doing ^d 
how we are doing it." 

Zellers said one of his first 
major steps to impnave the depart- 



ment is to speed up processing. 
"We certainly want to cut down 
on the paper flow," he said, 

Zellers said the cunent com- 
puter system is confusing and 
very hard to update aS new federal 
and slate regulations and require- 
ments change. "We're hoping the 
new system will make a big dif- 
ference. It is an imponant step. 
We really need the technology," 
Zellers said. 

Space is also an issue for the 
department. Zellers said. 
"Students need to be aware of our 
cramped physical constraints," he 
said. According to Zellers. the 
department may soon have the use 
of two classrooms to relieve the 
spacial confinemenls. 

Zellers commented on the 
number of loans which are being 
processed through the Finical Aid 
Department. Since the federal 
govemmeni cut much of the funds 
for Pell Grants and created subsi- 
dized loans. Zeller estimates the 
number of loans processed has at 
least doubled. He said that num- 



ber is continuing to grow and the 
staff is not being enlarged. 

"We're processing a great deal 
more aid with little more help," 
Zellers said. - 

Currently the department is 
operating with eight staff mem- 
bers, including Zellers, "Staff is 
certainly an issue," he said. "1 
think it is important thai shidenls 
understand the limit we are work- 
ing in." 

Despite the problems facing 
the office, Zellers said he is com- 
mitted to helping the smdents. "I 
do want to know the students' 
concerns." he said, "I'd like to uti- 
lize the newspaper as an instru- 
ment of communication." In the 
future, Zellers said he would like 
lo publish updates on new federal 
and stale regulations and process- 
es. 

"The financial aid siafT feels as 
badly as the students about the 
service." Borelli said. Zellers said 
the staff is commited to providing 
good service, but reiterated the 
department is understaffed.

Chief Reporter 

IPSGA presidential candidates faced each other m 
a subdued debate durmg a scheduled open forum last 
Wednesday. Students were able lo meet the candi- 
dates, listen to the candidates' speeches and ask them 
questions. 

The candidates discussed park- 
ing, diversity, and travel funds. 
The two presidential candidates. 
Cecil Baker and Kevin Eads, dis- 
agreed on how to approach many 
of the issues. 

IPSGA director of 

Multicultural Affairs Chris Douse 
questioned the panel about cam- 
pus diversity. "What would you 
do lo pur^uade the admin is iration, 
deans, and chairs of other depart- 
ments to hire more staff of colorT' [&gt;ousc asked. 

"I'll be on the admin isiraiion's back about this 
one. It's always been an issue to me." Eads said, "I 
talked to a friend of mine and he told me he felt very 
cheated of the college experience because there is no 
diversity." 

Baker said he believes talking to the administra- 
tion would be a better solution. "You have to have 
people from all backgrounds for education ... I am 
not prejudiced. Maybe a slogan could be. 'Prejudice 
doesn't exist at IPFW.' Wipe that out, everybody gets 
treated equal — It's ea.sy lo say, but hard lo do." Baker 
said. 

Baker said he believes those deans are aware of 
the problem If they feel more mlnoriues need to be 
hired, he said he would work toward diat. But he said 
he didn't want to use just his opinion, but he wants 
nrore research on whal the deans feel. 



Eads pointed out that minorities in faculty arc 
necessary for a complete education. "It is unfortunate 
that when you take a course in African- American 
History here at IPFW and the leacher happens to be a 
while male. I learned a lot from this individual, but 
wouldn't it have been more to learn from a black 
male or female?" Eads asked. 

Shaun Stanley, candidate for vice president of leg- 
islation, look Eads' point one siep further lo say that 
courses needed to be laughi with more diversity. "I 
think that one of the things that can be done is putting 
more diversity in dw course itself," Stanley said, "If 
classes were taught wilh a diverse mind maybelhe 
message will get out," 

Douse asked whether his current position would 
be carried into the next IPSGA administration. 

Eads said he thought Douse's position is very 
valuable. Whatever the Director of Multicultural 
Affairs could do would be valuable, be added. 

Both candidates agreed minorities should be 
recruited to be a pan of IPSGA. 

"I would work through the newspaper. The 
Communicator, I would keep advertising that student 
govemmeni is open lo everybody." Baker said. 

"I would go 10 the groups... bring a petition or iwo 
and say. 'here this is what student government can do 
for you, would you like to be a pan of diis?'" Eads 
said. 

"Student government needs to sit in with, for 
instance. DCC and tfte Muslim students." Eads said. 
Eads meniioncd the universily Diversity Council 
needs lo meet more often. "We should push for more 
mceiings; ai least once a month," Eads said. 

In his speech. Baker emphasized the need to push 
the administration to build a proposed parking garage 
soulh of the library.

Administration creates new plan for funding student travel 



By S. Brant Kcllcy 
EdItor-in-Chkr 

Confusion and student dismay over dis- 
continuation of tra\-el funds from \be student 
goti'emmcnt led the administration to search 
for a way to aid student organizations in 
detraying era \« I expenses. 

The Purdue University Internal Audits 
olTice handed down the iniiial decision at the 
end of last semester lo disconunue funding of 
student organization travel, according to 
IPFW Business Administrator for Student 
Affairs, Public and Environmental Affairs 



and Education Phillip 
Davicb. 

"Whai we had 
been doing [allowing 
IPSGA to fund student 
organization travel] for 
tbe last few years was 
wrong ... we had not 
been following ihe rules 
as far as the business 
office is concerned," 
Davich said. 
However. IPSGA Vice President of 
Finance Michael Heii said, "We still don't 




know who gave the final order lo cui it off." 

Dean of Students Marian Zimmerman 
added. "We've had different people tell us 
what we can or cannot do." 

Since PU's Internal Audits office handed 
down its decision, IPFW student organiza- 
tions have received no aid for travel expens- 
es. IPSGA president Mark King said. "At this 
particular moment, tbere are no funds ... 
whatsoever." 

Zimmerman uid she and King went to 
Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs Frank 
Borelh to ask him to look into other possibili- 
ties for helping student (»ganizaiions offset 



travel expenses. 

Last Friday. Zimmerman listed some pos- 
sibilities for funds for group travel. Among 
them were a lecture series or a fund drive, 
among other ideas. 

The fmal proposal was to use die accumu- 
lated interest from the student organizations' 
bank accounts for travel funds Presendy. all 
student organization money is in a single 
account and is not bearing interest, according 
to BoreUi and Davich. 

Davich said ibe bank did not give interest

ByNolT. Beckley 
News Editor 

In July of 1993. SPIN magazine 
called the Buffalo trio named Goo 
Goo Dolls, the best rock band a 
writer had ever seen. I must admit I 
concur with his opinion. This 
month, the Goos released their fifth 
and best CD to date titled "A Boy 
Named Goo." (They named the 
biuid for a blow up "goo goo doll" 
you could order from the back 
pages of a sleazy magazine.) 

Tbe CD captures a great amount 
of the raw emotion which energizes 
their shows. Anyone who saw them 
on their last tour when they opened 



for Soul Asylum on their "Grave 
Dancers Union" tour can vouch for 
the Goos vitality, 

"A Boy Named Goo" is a solid 
collection of hard/alternative rock 
with definite influence from the 
Minneapolis sounds of the 
Replacements, Soul Asylum and 
Husker Du. The Goos also cover 
two tunes by two Buffalo-based 
punk rock bands. Covering 
unknown songs is a departure from 
tjoo Goo Dolls' style; on their third 
CD tbey covered the artist formeriy 
known as Prince and also tbe 
Plimsolils' "Million Miles Away." 
(originally from die "Valley Giri" 
soundtrack). Other bands Goo Goo 



Dolls have covered are Blue Oyster 
Cull, the Rolling Stones and 
Credence Clearwater Revival. The 
Goos have also been featured on the 
No Alternative CD and on die "Son 
in Law" soundtrack. 

In "A Boy Named Goo," Goo 
Goo Dolls have captured the inten- 
sity of their early CDs with the lyri- 
cal maturity which dominated their 
most recent CD and which also 
made appearances on their third 
CD- "A Boy Named Goo" is not for 
everyone, but for those who appre- 
ciate an intelligent, coherent piece 
of hard/altferaat!ve miisic Ihis \Vould 
be Uie quintessential CD'lo add to 
your collection.

found five different brands at 
the grocery that fit the regular and 
homestyle type of OJ.: Minuie 
Maid, Florida Gold. Tropicana, 
Kroger brand and Sun Gold. The 
rating system will be based on 
missing gloves (you don't have to 
be Judge Ito to figure this out) One 
missing glove means the OJ. in 
question needs help, Two missing 
gloves means the O.J. in question 
is okay, but something is missing 
(maybe DNA evidence.) Three 
missing gloves means the O.J. in 
question is practically perfect And 
last but not least, four missing 
gloves means the OJ. in question 
is guilty of being phenominally 
good. 

Let the trial begin, 
MINUTE MAID ORANGE 
JUICE 

First of all, it is important to 



know that for a 64-ounce carton 
you arc paying SI. 99 For a serving 
of eight ounces you are consuming 
about 110 calories and lots of 
orange taste. This particular juice 
was not very pulpy which is good. 
TTic juice itself was sweet and kind 
of lan. The aftenasie was okay, but 
I felt something was just not right 
about it. As far as 0,J,'s go, it is 
okay. My final rating of two miss- 
ing gloves is due to the fact tbat 
something was missing from this 
juice. 
FLORIDA GOLD ORANGE 
JUICE 
Again, this orange juice comes 
in the 64-ounce carton, but the 
price of S2.49 is not even worth 10 
cents. Yep, that's right. 1 do not 
like this 0,J, because it was not 
very swcci to begin with Add in 
the weird aftertaste (trust me. it's 



weird) and tbrow in the non- 
orangey taste and you have a disas- 
ter for an orange Juice, The good 
thing about this juice is that for 
eight ounces you consume 1 10 
calories. Since I can not say too 
much more than that, my fmal rat- 
ing is one missing glove because 
this orange juio: needs help. 
TROPICANA SEASON'S 
BEST ORANGE JUICE 
Well, well, well, third try is a 
charm!! 1 usually do not drink this 
juice, but after gulping down this 
particular juice 1 think I will have 
to make a change. This orange 
juice was called the "season's 
best;" after lasting it 1 can under- 
stand why. The juice goes down 
smooth and has this freshly 
squeezed pulpy taste that makes 
my mouth water for more. At S2.49 
a pop for a 64-ounce carton and 



1 10 calories per string this onnge 
juice itally is perfect, if an OJ. can 
be. (Maybe not the Simpson kind.) 
So. the final rating is a whopping 
four missing gloves. 
KROGER BRAND ORANGE 
JUICE 
Okay, let's think about this for a 
minute. Not that there is anything 
wrong with grocery brand prod- 
ucts, but orange juice?? After sip- 
ping this juice slowly I found that 
the taste was a little better than the 
Rorida Gold stuff. However, it was 
kind of watered down. Because it 
was watered down the taste was 
faint as was the aftertaste. The 
interesting thing was that there arc 
only 100 calories per eight ounce 
serving. The cost was only SI. 50 
for a 64-ounce carton-bargain!! 
Since this one was a Utde bit better 
than die Rorida Gold. I gave it two

Candyman. Candyman. 

(handyman, Candyman. Candyman, 
Thank goodness I do not have a 
mirror in front of me. Yes, 
"Candyman; Farewell to the Flesh" 
is the sequel to the riveting first 
"Candyman." If you can remember 
anything besides going to a mirror 
after watching the first 
"Candyman" then I commend you. 
Since I could not remember a lot 
from the first "Candyman," the 
sequel was great because it filled 
some voids and helped me to under- 
stand the history of the myth. 

The movie does a great job of 
tracing the history of Daniel 



Robitaille, the enslaved African 
American who fell in love with a 
Southern belle. Caroline. 
Unfortunately, love does not win 
out for the two. and Robitaille pays 
a hefty price for the love of his life. 
The myth of Candyman is started 
because of his bizzarre and graphic 
death, which explains a lot of 
things. 

The graphic scenes themselves 
did not scare this viewer Usually 
hooks twisting in human flesh and 
blood squirting everywhere fright- 
ens me, but not this time. This was 
because the Tilm was pretty pre- 
dictable. Whenever anyone said 
"Candyman, candyman, candyman,

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q: What is (he difference 
between "anonymous" and 
"confidential" HIV testing? 

A: For anonymous testingrthe 
client gives no Identifying 
Information so the test can 
never be traced back to the 
Individual. To obtain test 
results, the client must 
present his/her code number. 
No documentation of 
anonymous tests can be 
provided. Confidential testing 
Is name-linked so the client 
can obtain test results even If 
the code number Is lost; and 
documentation of test results 
can be provided with the 
written consent of the client.

IP ASS worth passing 



When teachers and administra- 
tors clamored thai siandardizcd 
'tetling wus un/air and needed [o be 
replaced by a icsl which measured 
'siudcnUi' abilities more fairly ihc 
legislaiufc responded wiib the 
Indiana Perronnance Assessment 
for Sludcni Success. 

Now (bat the check has been 
written for this new lesi, the legisla- 
ture is, not ready to sign it. 

The overall price for IPASS is 
SIOO million over two years. The 
Republican budget prescnied in late 
February included $17 million lo 
give and score the lest. 

Somehow, they left out the S83 
million needed lo train (cachets and 
tielp siudenis who don'l pass ibc 
lest caich up to their grade level. 
This remediation alone is predicted 
to cost S55 million over two years. 

The stale legislature needs to 
wake up and look at bow ridiculous 
Ibis all is. What is the point in 
spending SI7 million to give a test 
(eacbcrs haven't been trained on, 
which won't count for anything and 
which won't be used to help stu- 
dents in any way shape or fonn? 

This situation is completely 
ludicrous. The Indiana legislature 
cither needs to approve complete 
I funding, or bold off on IPASS until 
!il can, and who knows when that 
' would be. 

Educators have developed a 



Commentary 



mote realistic way to assess siu- 
denLs learning, yet the Indiana leg- 
islators are not willing to spend the 
money to make it work. 

In order to have skilled workers 
and free-thinking community mem- 
bers, students must be educated. 

Right now teachers are required 
to "leach to the test" if they want 
their district to get any money at 
all. The IPASS wilt change thai. By 
a.sking short answer and essay ques- 
tions teachers will have more lee- 
way. Instead of (caching students to 
regurgitate information, teachers 
will be required lo help students 
leam higher order thought process- 
es, something ISTEP does not 
require. 

These arc valuable skills. 
Business leaders need employees 
that can think and reason for them- 
selves. Teachers have a bard lime 
Tilting these kinds of activities into 
the curriculum because of the 
"facts" ihey need to leach for 
ISTEP. 

Teachers need the freedom 
afforded them by IPASS. Without it 
students will continue to fall 
through the cracks. Who knows 
how many kids will be compro- 
mised in the process. The sooner 
the legislature gets together and 
approves the funding for IPASS, 
the belter, 



You do the math . . 



As a card-carrying member of 
the Republican pany (ga.sp), I must 
say 1 am dismayed ai the thought of 
Pat (Mcin Kampf) Buchanan run- 
ning for president again. We tried it 
once his way and we lost the White 
House to an ineffective, decision- 
impaired good ol' boy from 
Arkansas. He may have not been 
the nominee, but his message rever- 
berated .tl;t^9,ugb the Astrodome, acd 
out to all comers of the country. 

Will we, as Republicans, let Hen 
Buchanan speak again at out con- 
vention? He 
will damage us 
with his homo- 
phobic gay- 
bashing, his 
racial slurs and 
his Isolationist 
attitude. With 
allies like this, 
who needs the 
democrats to 
beat us? As 
long as the GOP 
, ""^^^^^^^^~ continues to 
1 kowtow to the religious right, the 
rest of the country will be alienated 
by us. 

Did anyone notice that Newt's 
"Contract With America" had little 
to do with abortion, gay rights, race 
and the Christian Coalition? Newt 
realized the Republican viewpoint 
on these issues would cripple the 






NolT. 
Beckley 



Republican movement and alienate 
Ihe rest of the country. Freshman 
representatives knew ihis-why can't 
the old guard of the GOP make the 
connection? 

The old guard must realize that, 
in general, people are more con- 
cerned about their pockeibook than 
whether Jim and Bob can get mar- 
ried. Republicans will win if they 
curb their desire to dictate policies 
concerning how people conduct 
their personal lives. 

I hope the candidates will realize 
they can win the most powerful 
position in the world (second only 
10 the head of the Gambini family) 
if Ihey stay focused on the cam- 
paign. But if the GOP allows Herr 
Buchanan lo dictate the battle- 
ground, no one will win except for 
Bill (Gennifer who?) Clinton. 

1 Just pray thai Ross {paranoid 
lilllc Martian) Peroi gets into the 
race again; it may screw up the 
election process but at least we will 
have someone to laugh at now that 
Dan (anything you say Marilyn) 
Quayle is noi running for president. 

Bill {sorry Vince. you're not 
needed anymore) Clinton has had 
two full years to mark his lerriiory 
in history and be has failed to live 
up 10 many promises. His office is 
there for the talcing, but if Buchanan 
gels the GOP nod, well , . . you do 
themaib!

Homosexually Speaking 

Friends must stick with outed gays 




True story. 

"Jeff just came burbling oui of 
the clo.sei. After years of torment 
and denial, he has recently come to 
terms with himself and is happy 
living Ihe homosexual lifestyle. 
Yet his worst fears have come true. 
One of his friends has shunned 
him. Jeff had ihoughi this could 
happen, but he was still affected 
emotionally when it happened. 

It's bad enough ihai "Stan" can- 
not accept Jeff for the homosexual 
that be is. but be has decided not to 
ever associate with Jeff and has 
spread rumors about him. 
According to Sian, Jeff has been 
hitting on him. 
This is, of 
course, to pro- 
tect Stan from 
ever being per- 
ceived as a gay 
because of his 
friendship with 
Jeff. What 
Stan did not 
bother to con- 
sider is Jeff's 
feelings, which 
have been shat- 
tered into a million pieces. 

One of the biggesi fears every 
closet homosexual has is that she 
or he will lose all of her or his 
existing friends. These are people 
thai have shared many good and 
bad experiences together and their 
fears arc warranted. 

Losing a friend is traumaiic, no 
matter bow ii happens. But it is 
thai much harder to deal with when 
you lose a friend for being your- 
self, which is wbai has happened to 
Jeff. For those of you who can't 
fathom what this would feel like, 
imagine losing someone you love 
because you decide to change reli- 
gions. 

T^ere could be many reasons 
why Sian feels the way he does. He 
may feel as if Jeff has lied io him 
during iheu' relationship, although 
Jeff was really lying to himself, not 
Sian. He may also fear his own 
sexuality, li's been my experience 
thai those who fear homosexuals 
have some issues about their own 
sexuality ibey need 10 face. If Sian 



Paul 
Tupper 



would hang out with Jeff, he may 
have to listen to gay discussions 
that he is not ready to hear. 

What's the solution here? 
Should Jeff just cut bis los.scs and 
move on? I ibink so. When you 
enter the gay community, there is 
an overwhelming amount of sup- 
port from ibose who have experi- 
enced the same kind of hatred and 
discrimination. Jeff has made and 
continues to make good friends 
that will accept and love him for 
who he is. 

As for Sian, he needs to talk to 
someone. Anyone will do. Hiere is 
some reason why he says he 
doesn't have a problem with gay 
people, but he can'i accepi Jeff. 

It is discomforting to think that 
people can just throw away friends. 
Talking lo someone will force Stan 
lo confront his fears. Stan and Jeff 
may never be friends again, but 
this situation can be prevented. 

Whether Stan warns lO believe it 
or not, gays are noi going to go 
away. In fact, with the growing 
acceptance of homosexuality, gays 
are growing in numbers. More and 
more of us are coming out and 
demanding respect. 

For those of you who have gay 
fnends or are supportive of homo- 
sexuals in general. I ask thai you 
help us eradicate homophobia by 
slapping the hands of your (nends 
who bash gays or put down those 
who are openly gay. Let it be 
known thai you do noi condone 
such closed mindedness. Those 
heterosexuals who think they are in 
the majority as they laugh at gay 
jokes they will find they are actual- 
ly in the minority. 

The rest of Jeff's friends are 
being supportive and are accepting 
him for what he is. As mie friends 
should be, they are relieved lo see 
him finally happy. All of them are 
pulling pressure on Stan to be less 
hypocnucal. It would be sad to see 
Stan lose all of these friends 
because of his bigoied 
fnend's self-realization.

Letters to the Editor 



Stereotyping equally unfair 
to gays and heterosexuals 



To Ihe editor: 

YoM P. Tupper, are you kidding 
me!? You need some serious help. 
It seems to me thai you're not a.s 
secure as you think you are about 
your own sexuality. Why else 
would you keep harping on the fact 
thai you're gay. Rne, you are gay - 
what do you wani from us hetero- 
sexuals, a dozen roses and a new 
tutu? You keep telling us you're 
gay and you keep feeding us your 
gay anecdotes - O.K., enough 
already, we know you're gay. 
That's wonderful. More power lo 
you man, or whatever you prefer to 
be called. I could personally care 
less which gender you prefer &lt;o 
.sleep widi. lei alone what you think 
of us so-called "breeders" (note 
here, for those unfamiliar with Mr. 
Tupper's terminology, his expres- 
sion "breeders." refers to heterosex- 
uals, I presume, and that fact that 
we have intercourse to reproduce or 
"breed"). We don't care that your 
favorite hobby is sex. What a warm 
and appealing thought, though - 
NOT! 1 have nothing against homo- 
sexuals, but your self-righteous, 
he icro- hammering articles need lo 
be put to rest. You don't see a het- 
erosexual writing in every week, 
telling about his or her bedroom 
adventures. No one is screaming, 
"Hey everybody! Look at me! I am 
a heterosexual and I like doing it in 
Ihe missionary position!" Why do 
you have to do it? Are you reassur- 
ing yourself of your own sexuality, 
or are you having second thoughts 
about homosexuality? You try too 
hard Mr, Tupper, Ease up man 
Who cares if you're gay? Don't 
push it on us. We aren't trying to 
"straigbien" you ouL 

You are not a bad writer and 
there is a lot more to write about 
than your sexual preferences and 
fantasies. Why don't you use your 
talent to ease people's minds about 
sexuality rather than terrorize them 
with the Ihougbti of having inier- 
course with a person of the same 
gender? I don'l know how a h&lt;Hno- 



sexual is supposed to ihink or even 
bow one thinks, but in heterosexual 
relationships, sex isn't the primary 
source of happines.s. Is it with 
homosexuals? If it is, you have big- 
ger problems than I thougbL 

I am not writing tliis response 
out of prejudice against gays, [f you 
want to be gay that is your right. I 
am wiling in defense of heterosex- 
uals. You wrote that we "breeders" 
stereotype gays. We think, in your 
opinion, that gays "size" us up. 
Speak for yourself dude! Look or 
don'l look, it doesn't matter to mc. 
Besides, who's stereotyping who? 
Your article depicts all heterosexu- 
als as the same; oppressive lo gays. 
Once again, it doesn't matter Join 
the army, run for office, fly lo the 
moon - just don't push your sexual 
beliefs and preferences on me. Quit 
biding behind your pen and cla.ssi- 
fying us all into a seemingly preju- 
diced lynch mob. You sit behind 
your typewriter and type up all 
sorts of innuendoes. You speak 
freely of hugging and kis.sing your 
gay partners in your "gay commu- 
nity" during class, but when a het- 
erosexual questions your motives 
or thoughts, you "freak." The fact 
is, heterosexuals have a bard time 
understanding your thoughts and 
motives concerning your sexual 
preferences. If you can express 
your feelings and thoughts why 
shouldn't we? 

"Breeders" populate this planei. 
Some "great being" gave us ibe job 
of reproduction. This mighi be a 
new concept to you. but it is a 
"nature-lbing," like when men and 
women want to start a family. It is a 
job that gays choose not lo panici- 
paie in. Fine, Ihe world is a very 
crowded place anyway The point 
of this letter, be it right or wrong, is 
that you wouldn'l even be writing 
about sleeping with other guys, if 
not for a couple of heterosexual 
"breeders." Think about it!

To the Editor. 

You have chosen to show the dichotomy of Fort 
Wayne at its worst with the two columns side by side in 
the March 16lh issue of The Communicaior, Both 
"authors" reflect a narrow view of the world and ignore 
the ordinary. They pick the extremes and punue ihem 
with a pointed and narrow view. 

College is a bioadening experience and both authors 
miss the ordinary, the mundane, the day-to-day living 
and giving which goes on in this world, yes even Fort 
Wayne. Sbame on Larry Gwaltney and Paul Tupper for 
such biased and elementary observations. If they chose 
to re-read what they have wriitea and look for the 
broad aspect of just ordinary living they would under- 
stand thai they miss the obvious point thai we are all 



human. 

I hope and pray the letters are not a reflection o{ the 
mindset our local university is destined to produce. The 
impact is far reaching and reflects no growth, only ihe 
repetition of ibe pasi. Remember International 
Harvester? Tbcy built a spon uullty vehicle 20 years 
ago and Fon Wayne let ii die a miserable death. I find 
it amazing that the very vehicle which died over 20 
years ago is now the hottest selling segment of the 
automotive markeL It only goes to i^Dve that you aesA 
to take care of the ordinary and move forward to grow. 

The next Fon Wayne obituary will be "The Old 
Fon"; b anybody surprised?

Volleyball team gets 
back on track better 
passing credited 



ByS. Bnnt Kcllty 
Editor-ln-Chlef 

The VoUeydons may be display- 
ing, after much turmoil, (he pass- 
ing IPFW coach Amic Ball deems 
necessary Tor solid play in the 
MIVA and the up-coming touma- 
menl. 

"Our passing was very good 
this weekend ... even in the game 
we lost," Ball said. 

The VolleyJons used Ihe superi- 
ot pas.sing lo defeat the University 
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM). 
15-1. 15-4, 10-15, 17-15. last 
Saturday night at Milwaukee's 
Klotche Center for ils fourth 
MIVA win. 

Neither team hit well in the fust 
game. IPFW hit 24.4 percent, 
while the Panthers bit for 14 errors 
in the game. 

IPFW stepped up the offense lo 
bit 40 pcrccnl 
during the sec- 
ond game en 
route to a 1S~4 
pounding. 
UWM record- 
ed more errors 
than kills and 
flnished with a 
negative hit- 
ting percent- Wilholt 
age. 

The Panthers came back in the 
third game despite a 7.7 percent 
hitting mark to win 15-10. The 
VoUeydons hit only 2.3 percent of 
their kill attempts, partly because 
they committed 13 hitting errors. 

"We made a lineup change that 
third game ... it was a coaching 
error on my part," Ball said. 
Ricardo Soler began the game set- 
ting and David Wilhoit passed to 
start the game. Ball said Wilhoit 
passed eiilremely well.bi^t ibe 
team's chemistry was different. 





and UWM picked up on it. 

The stage was set for tbc final 
game of the match, which lPin,V 
pulled out, 17-15. The Panthers 
succeeded on one-third of their kill 
attempts and IPFW ened in hitting 
14 times, but the VoUeydons went 
to the net more often and recorded 
two more kills 
as a result. 

Middle 
hitter Felipe 
Ralat led the 
way with 21 
kills and 11 
digs and out- 
side hitter 
Soler added 
16 while hit- 
TerMoIen Ung 41 per- 
cent for the 
match. 

Scott Lauer returned to his orig- 
inal role as a setter and contributed 
55 assists while showing the way 
defensively with 12 digs. Ball said 
Soler was better suited to his origi-

Middle hitter Mike Ter Molen 
also had a season-high 15 kills for 
IPFW. "They (UWM) overloaded

Ball said.

Greg Hinkle led the Panthers

Olson added 12 kills and 12 digs 
as the UWM registered 20 assisted

IPFW tennis teams 
starts season well 



By S. Brant Kelley 
Edltor-ln-Chlef 

The IPFW men's tennis team 
started the season with some high 
expectations. As IPFW coach Dan 
Brogan said, "We think we have a 
chance to challenge for the title ... 
We have some good players return- 
ing, some good leaders." 

The men's tennis team pulled 
out two wins over spring break to 
start off the season. However, the 
team lost its first match of die sea- 
son to St. Cloud Slate University 
(SCSU). a school ranked in the top 
10. 

"Unfortunately, we played our 
first match against the best team," 
Brogan said, "Overall, we were 
very pleased (with our play)."

VoUeydons 
take second 
straight 
match 

Team prepares 
for upcoming 
tourney 

ByS.Brani Kclley 
Edilor-ln-Cblef 

The IPFW men's volleyball 
team returned home after a 
road trip on the West Coast and 
won its second game in two 
days against kinder MIVA 
competition. But the 
VoUeydons got a scare at Lewis 
University (LU) last Sunday. 

The VoUeydons did finally 
defeat the Flyers, 15-13. 8-15. 
15-12, 10-15. 15-13. at 
Romeoville. III. in a hard- 
fought match for second place 
in the MIVA. The win pro- 
pelled IPFW to a 5-1 record in 
Ihe MIVA while LU dropped to 
4-2. 

IPFW coach Amie Ball said, 
"It was a real important match, 
especially on the road ... 
they're a very good team ... 
Lhey beat Ball State twice." 

VoUeydons Ricardo Soler 
and Craig Collins each had 26 
kills to lead IPFW. The 
VoUeydons were successful on 
37.4 percent of their kill 
attempts for the match and 
dominated defensively with 32 
digs and 32 total blocks. 

"I think the blocking and the 
hitting efficiency were the dif- 
ference." Ball said, 

Sean Sultan led the Flyers 
with 19 kills and five other LU 
players had 11 or more for a 
balanced attack which had 21 
more kills than IPFW. 
However, their kill percentage 
was lower, 28.9 percent, and 
the Ryers blocked only 13,totaI 
kill aoempu. 

IPFW improved to 9-11 
while LU dropped to 16-9. 

Ball is pleased with the 
team's improvement, "We're 
obviously playing better. I'm 
not sure we're playing at the 
level they're at, but we're get- 
ting better," he said. 

Last evening, the VoUeydons 
played Ball State University 
(BSU) at Muncie and this 
weekend. IPFW will host the 
Farm Bureau/Baker &amp; Daniels 
Invitational tournament, which 
includes eighth-ranked BSU, 
sixth-ranked University of 
California at Santa Barbara 
(UCSB) and third-ranked and 
defending NCAA champions 
Penn State University.

on [he account and. In return, did not 
charge for service fees associated 
. with the account. He also said Ihe 
Individual accounts were loo small to 
accrue iniercst. 

Prior to the new proposal, no 
funds for travel were available to 
individual students or to organized 
groups. 

King said, however, that restric- 
tion applies only to travel c;ipenscs. 
"The groups can still come to us for 
funding for other things," be said. 

Davich said Ihe administration 
had received complaints about stu- 
dent organizations receiving money 
for group travel before the PO 
[nteinal Audits office stepped in. 
"The objective of the student fee is to 
provide, to all students, services thai 
can be used." he said. If an organlM- 
tlon receives money for travel, that 
money is not necessarily bcnentling 
all students, he added. 

"There were two or three groups 
who used a lot of money and every- 
body else knew nothing about il," 
Zimmerman said. 

On Monday, Dorclli 'called an 
open fnrum to discuss his proposal to 
use Inlerest gained from the student 
organizations' balances. According 
to the proposal, the purpose is "to 
provide recognized IPFW special 
Interest student organizations access 
to limited funds held by the univcrsi- 

ly." 

"Wc are sympathetic to these 

clubs that need to flourish." said 
Davich. He added that was the reason 
the administration was searching for 
a way to a help student organizations 
fund navel. 

Zimmerman said the administra- 
tion's Idea was to bring something 
back for the organizations, 

Heit said Borelli had already sent 
letters to student groups concerning 
his proposal. 

The proposal states an organiza- 
tion seeking travel funds must submit 
Its request 30 days in advance and 
provide the organization's name, 
amount of money requested and 
details of the group's trip with the 
request. 

Also, each organization is eligible 
for a maximum amount of money 
which is determined by that organi- 
zation's account balance. The assets 
of the various groups vary greatly, 
and some groups' principal con- 
tributes more to the inieresi pool than 
others'. 

Borelli said the funds would be 
distributed on a first-come, firsi- 
sen-e basis, unless the majority of the 
student groups wanted this pan of the 
policy changed. 

According to Davich, the bank 
account's principal will not be 
touched, only the interest will be 
used to help organizations defray 
travel expenses 

The account balances total around 
S35.000. according to Davich. He 
said the total fluctuates between 
S20.000 and S30.000. 

Borelli emphasized the policy 
concerning how and to whom the 
funds are to be distributed is very 
flexible The majority of the student 
organizations would be able to set 
policy concerning the funds' use. 

Tbe majority of the involved siu- 
dent organizations need to sign or

approve the final proposal before it 
comes into effect, Borelli said. 

Borelli also stated he wanted cri- 
teria used to dctcnnine who receives 
travel funds to be set ahead of time 
so each group's approval will not be 
needed for each travel expenditure. 
The foremost criterion he said he 
would use is whether or not the 
requesting group has received funds 
in the past. 

Davich said unused funds would 
be rolled over into the following aca- 
demic year. 

Three students. George Gounaris, 
Kathy Rassuli and Candy Snelling. 
will represent the student organiza- 
tions and will determine which 
changes are to be made lo the origi- 
nal proposal. 

The PU accounting office told 
IPSGA to discontinue giving money 
to student organizations for travel 
expenses because such practice was 
against the rules set for student ser- 
vice fee use. 

IT the board of trustees changes its 
definition of student service fees, no 
problem would exist with student 
government giving money to student 
groups for travel- 

"My personal feeling is that stu- 
dent government should be able to 
fund these trips." said IPSGA senator 
and presidential candidate Kevin 
Eads. 

"Heit is working on changing the 
policy thai governs us. because the 
administraiion has also said that ser- 
vices are included," King said. 



- Election from page 1 

The two presidential candidates 
clashed on tbe weekly column 
"Homoscxually Speaking." Baker 
said, "I am disappointed that it is 
run weekly. Maybe quarterly. We 
need educaiional issues in the 
paper. It's not facts. It's just some- 
body's opinion. All I am suggest- 
ing is. keep il facts." 

Eads. however, felt that opinions 
arc just as important as facts. "It is 
a different point of view All points 
of view should be mentioned. Wc 
need to see dilferenl points of view 
to grow stronger," he said. 

Baker said he will not support 
the garage unless il is on the south 
side of campus Baker backed his 
stance with a resolution passed by 
the senate stating their support for a 
garage south of tbe library. 

"If our votes don't count, then 
why are we senators?" Baker 
asked. "If they want to put it over 
there in 20 years, then let them," 

"We are suggesting to them thai 
where they want to put it is not a 
good place," Tcrri Grimm, candi- 
date for vice president of legisla- 
tion, said. 

"I know that on big campuses 
they have to walk a long way. but 
we're not a big campus," Baker 
said. 

Nol everyone agreed with 
Baker. Stanley said she believes the 
walk across campus will not be a 
huge inconvenience compared to 
the walk Bloomington or West 
Layfayeiie students face. "I think it 
is better off going where the cam- 
pus is expanding," Stanley ^d. 

Eads said he would defer to tbe 
students for his opinion. "I don'i 
know if a referendum would be 
necessary, maybe just get a survey 
out to get the students' feeling. 
Student government just can't 
m^c that decision ibemselves. We 
have to fmd out the students' feel- 
ings," Eads said. 

The issue of travel funds was 
brought up by ISPGA Director of 
Communications Jerry Richardson. 
Richardson asked what the candi- 
dates would do lo reverse the cur- 
rent policy. 

"It is imporiant for the student 
organizations to be able to travel, to 
be able to bring back to this com- 
munity, because what they bring 
we can Icam from. I will take il to 
ihe administTBtion to see what I can 
get done." Eads said. 

Baker also said he would take 
tbe is.sue up with the administration

10 se« if the policy can be reversed. 
"Students were getting good input 
and would come back and help 
(other) students," Baker said. 

"Travel is important. The 
enrichment that they can bring back 
to this campus outweighs so much. 
There is so much that Ihey can 
bring back from other campuses 
that we don't have available to us," 
Grimm said. 

"Even if it [travel] benefits one 
person it benefits the campus," 
Stanley said. "We are here to be 
educated." 

In a response to whether not 
Internet would reduce the need to 
travel to other universities, Eads 
said, "Internet would be a great 
benefit to the students, but it is not 
going to take away from the per- 
sonal interaction that you have on 
these trips. You are able to take 
back a lot from the other students 
and what they have to offer." 

Although the panel agreed 
Internet access should not replace 
travel funds, but should be avail- 
able 10 students, the candidates dis- 
agree how Ihe on-line system 
should be funded and distributed. 

"I wish we had Internet. I just 
don't want everybody lo pay for 
it," Baker said. "1 am against the 
technology fee for everybody, I am 
for it for anybody who wants it 
[Internet access] individually." 

"If we do it we should do it for 
everybody. We have to do what is 
best for the students. The wave of 
tbe future is going to be Internet," 
Eads said. "You would have access 
to so much. Students wouldn't have 
to be at Ihe library so much. I think 
that most students would be willing 
to pay the three dollars a credit 
hour to save them Ihe hassle." 

The need for more funds to 
higher education also entered the 
discussion. Eads said he believes 
lobbying for funds for higher edu- 
cation needs to be a priority within 
the student government. "Higher 
education should be a priority in 
our state, in our school. We need to 
continue our lobbying efforts," 
Eads said. 




- Court from page 1 

The defendants, represented by 
King and Director of 
Communications Jerry 

Richardson, countered Adkins' 
claims with a 62+ page booklet 
arguing their case. Richardson 
claimed tliat although sc\-eral stu- 
dents never received the referen- 
dum information, the accountabili- 
ty lies somewhere other than in 



the IPSGA. 

"If there 15 fault it does nol lie 
within the adminisiraiurs of the 
referendum." said Richardson. 

The court did nol render a deci- 
sion on T\iesdiy. They will review 
the evidence and (he 80 pages of 
tcsiimony presented and will rule 
on March 23. according to Justice 
Charles Copctond.
