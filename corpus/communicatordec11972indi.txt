PIT performs Isben work tonight 




Rebecca West (right, played by Sharon Gabet) joins the 
household of John Rosmer (Lee Stangland) to help care 
for ailing and mentally deranged wife. Rosmersholm by 
Henrik Ibsen opens tonight at PIT. The performance be- 
gins at 8 p.m. 



Rosmersholm by Henrik 
Ibsen which will begin its 
run tonight at Purdue - 
Indiana Theatre is decribed 
as a masterpiece of un- 
folding themes and varies 
statements. One of the pre- 
dominate themes through- 
out Ibsen's work is Lhe 
theme of the liberated wo- 
man. 

When John Rosmer, the 
last of the ancient and much 
respected Rosmer family, 
becomes aware that the 
people of the community 
have been exploited and 
suppressed by the family's 
tight and narrow views of 
religion, John renounces 
his faith and gives up his 
position as minister of the 
congregation. He plans a 
Utopian society where all 
men are ennobled and 
aware of their dignity as 



human beings. 
Rebecca West, a self- 
educated and ambitious wo- 
man, joins the Rosmer 
household to help care for 
the dying wife, Beata 
Rosmer. When Beata dies 
Rebecca remains at 
Rosmersholm with John. 
Only when Rosmer re- 
nounces his faith does the 
community become 

suspicious of his relation- 
ship with Rebecca. In the 
end both John and Rebecca 
are destroyed by the 
narrow-minded ethics of 
their society. 

Rebecca Is very much like 
Ibsen's most famous poj - 
trait, Hedda Gabler — a 
unique woman, individual 
and separate in action from 
the man in her life. "But 
Rebecca,' according toDr. 
Daniel Cashman, director 



THE 



COMM 




of the production, "is even 
more complex and exciting 
than Hedda. Rebecca is 
capable of a wide variety 
of moods and motives; not 
as straight - forward as 
Hedda, Rebecca Is crafty 
and cunning.' 

Yet Ibsen shows the peril 
that awaits the liberated 
woman in today's society. 
According to Ibsen the 
"superior woman" of in- 
tellect cannot survive in a 
masculine society that 
views women chauvinisti- 
cally. 

Members of the cast are

Gabet, Dale Ware ( pro-

Purdue University), Jeff

This Sunday, Decembers, 
at 8 p.m., the newly- 
formed Community Or- 
chestra of I-PU at Fort 
Wayne, with Mr. David 
Jones as conductor, will 
present its first concert. 
Mr. Jones is the new con- 
certmaster of the Fort 
Wayne Philharmonic. 

"^Thls is the first time the 
university has had a full 
orchestra. Personnel of the 
orchestra number about 55, 
ranging in age from pre- 
teens to mature adults. The 
orchestra has full instru- 
mentation including per- 
cussion and piano. 

In attempting to form a 
community orchestra, 

people who like to play but 
for some reason cannot be 
part of the Philharmonic 
Orchestra were encourag- 
ed to join. 

Students from various a- 
rea schools, college stu- 
dents, professors, busi- 
nessmen, and housewives 
are all represented. 

Besides servingasan out- 
let for the talents of many 



good, but unused, musici- 
ans from this area, the or- 
chestra fulfills a vital need 
for music students who 
must have the experience 
of playing in an orchestra. 

The music to be played 
Sunday is all Symphonic, 
but possibly next semes- 
ter Mr. Jones would like 
to do a concerto program 
and perhaps an oratorio. 

On the program Sunday 
is Copland's "Outdoor O- 
verture," Shubert's "Un- 
finished Symphony," and 
Beethoven's "Egmont O- 
verture." 

Copland's "Outdoor O- 
verture" was commissi- 
oned by a Mr. Richter in 
1938 for the High School of 
Music and Art. In the same 
year It had its first per- 
formance. It Is an airy, 
brassy, robust piece - very 
typically Copland. 

The concert will be pre- 
sented in the Recital Hall 
in Building A and is open 
to the public.

Commission report discussed 

The preliminary report on higher education made re- 
cently by the Indiana Study Commission was the topic 
of discussion at an open student body meeting Tuesday, 
November 28, at the Indiana- Purdue University Fort 
Wayne Campus. 

Centering around the Indiana Study Commission's rec- 
ommendations regarding budget cuts, growth limitations 
of the regional campus, limitation of research, and en- 
rollment qualifications, the discussion devulged students, 
citizens, and legislators' beliefs. Writing to legislators 
was again reinforced as a good way to keep them in- 
formed of students' feelings at I-PU.

Ed I torfallq 
Speaking 



NEC Master Plan good 

with all the furor raised by the recent Master Plan of 
the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (HEC), It 
Is vlnually Impossible for an uninformed person to re- 
ceive an objective opinion of the Intent of the report. 
Nearly all opinions expressed to date have predicted 
Impending disaster for higher education, and especially 
for I-PU. 

We take Issue with the pessimists. In our opinion, the 
report simply recommends that I-PU continue growing 
along the same lines as we have In the past. Limited 
baccalaureate programs in the liberal arts, a broad 
range of occupational programs, and professional masters 
programs. 

Many people feel these recommendations are Inten- 
tionally cryptic. However, the Commission's reaction to 
the public outcry at the ambiguity has indicated that the 
language will be cleaned up, and that no tragedy is planned. 

Unfortunately, most students and citizens In the com- 
munity think this campus Is destined to become another 
Ivy Tech. Nothing In the report suggests that we will 
abandon all non-technical programs. 

Yet this rumor continues to be perpetrated by those 
who are in positions to realize how false It is. The result 
Is opinion mobilization around a false Issue and unde- 
served bad publicity for a basically good and needed 
commlssiori. 

No student power 
in athletic affairs 

For the most part students on this campus are significantly 
involved In the campus governance procedure. On no other 
Indiana or Purdue campus is student opinion respected and 
even solicited as it is here. 

But there areareasin which studentsdo not exercise suf- 
ficient authority. The most offensive area is athletics. 

Athletic policy is determined by a committee composed of 
six faculty and four students. This appears to be fair rep- 
resentation at face value, at least as one realizes the prac- 
tice of faculty control of athletic affairs. 

However, at I-PU each full-time student pays $10 each 
year to support the athletic programs. This Is a mandatory 
assessment for students, and optional to faculty or staff who 
wish to participate in Intra-mural athletics. 

The ethical violation Is obvious; students pay the bill but 
have only minority input Into the declslon-maldng process. 

We do not want to imply that athletics on this campus have 
been mlsmananged; to the contrary, the programs have been 
quite successful. 

This does not, however, excuse the fact that one body Is 
taxed and another has control of the tax revenue. 

The first law of student power applies here: student con- 
trol of student finances.

High prices has been the 
topic for much complain- 
ing lately. These com- 
plaints are justified and 
quite common amongst all 
walks of life. 

I would be safe In saying 
that every person reading 
this article has at onetime 
or another voiced an opi- 
nion about high prices. But 
what has anyone done about 
them? You may say, "What 
can I do about the problem 
of high prices?" You, 
alone, can't do much. But, 
if everyone would follow a 
few simple tips, perhaps 
we can drive some prices 
down. 

The reason prices are so 
high is because people pay 
them. If the producers 
could not sell their pro- 
ducts at their high prices, 
they would have to lower 
the price or go out of busi- 
ness. Before you buy any- 
thing, shop around for the 
best buy. Many Items can 
be purchased cheaper at 
discount stores or catalog 
sales centers. Many brand 
name items are sold in 
discount stores under their 
own brand. The quality is 
the same but the price Is 
much lower. 

Food prices can be beaten 
by purchasing from local 
brands. Several grocery 
stores carry their own 
brand name products which 
range from two to 15 cents 
less than the well-known 
brands. Bulk products 
which are sold by the pound 
will provide a savings 
which normally goes to 
provide a cellophane pack- 
age. 

The farmer provides a 
great savings because sev- 
eral of the middlemen are 
eliminated. Within a 10- 
mlle radius of Indiana U- 
nlverslty are over 200 fruit 
and vegetable stands which 
sell unsprayed, unproces- 
sed foods at almost one 
half of the price that you 
would pay at your local 
grocer. These foods have 
more flavor and natural 
minerals than the over- 
processed foods from the 
can. If you have a friend 
who is Interested in sav- 
ing on meat prices, you can 
have a beef processed and 
and packaged. The far- 
mer will deliver the ani- 
mal to the meat packing 
plant, who in turn will pro- 
cess and package the meat 
in portions t o suit any 
amount of people who go 
together In the purchase. 
Your meat price will drop 
from over $1 per pound to 
about 600 per pound. 

When the producer sees 
that his business is going 
to the 'little man,' he will 
have to come down with 
his prices or face the pos- 
sibility of goingout of busi- 
ness. Remember, the only 
way that high prices can be 
way that high prices can 
remain Is If we pay them.

To The Editor 



l&amp;M responds to 
Gottlieb's charges 

To the Editor: 

This letter Is In response 
to the article carried on 
Page 7 of your November 
17 issue concerning Dr. 
Sheldon F. Gottlieb of the 
Purdue University biology 
department. 

In reading the article. It 
was difficult to categorize 
It as a feature story and 
yet the lackof quotes, along 
with the opinions ex- 
pressed, disqualified it as 
an Interview piece. But 
there was no controversy 
on one point: the article., 
feature story. Interview or 
whatever.. .did establish 
the fact that Dr. Gottlfeb 
is seemingly as concerned 
about the environment as 
we are. Unfortunately, most 
critics do not have solu- 
tions. 

The one central theme 
that emerges from Indiana 
&amp; Michigan Electric Com- 
pany's current advertising 
program is that the use 
of coal is vitally Import- 
ant to I&amp;M if the com- 
pany Is to aven an energy 
crisis for the customers 
it serves — customers 
being: homes, industries, 
offices and even college 
campus facilities such as 
lU-Purdue. Yet the second 
paragraph of your story on 
Dr. Gottlieb reads ( our 
quotes): "At the present 
time, the major source of 
power In this country is 
obtained from burning 
fossil fuel, the most im- 
portant of which is coal. 
Indiana and (sic) Michigan 
Electric Company is said 
to realize this and Is most 
reluctant to tell the pub- 
lic the whole (slc)story. ' 
We're telling the whole 
story as we view it as a 
problem of great publi-; 
concern. 

The article subsequently 
notes that "Nashville, 
Tennessee, has developed 
a system whereby they can 
supply their whole city of 
447,877 population plus all 
their Industry with all the 
electric power they need 
with almost no sulfur 
dioxide emission." But the 
very next sentence is 
somewhat less optimistic: 
"It (the new system?) 
hopefully will be com- 
pleted by 1974." 



In its current advertising 
campaign, I&amp;M has noted 
that the removal of sulfur 
dioxide in the burning of 
coal to produce electricity 
has proved to be a vexing 
problem for scientists, and 
that the technology to ac- 
complish this removal has 
not yet emerged from the 
laboratory. 1 1 ,- 

In refuting this dh,_tl|e 
"Focus 15" program aired 
over WANE-TV, Nov. 12, 
Dr. Gottlieb reported that 
he recently had read 
"several articles, quite 
laudatory" dealing with the 
sulfur removal from coal. 
But the fact still remains 
that no system Is working 
today on a continuing basis. 

I&amp;M and its parent firm, 
Ameirtcari Elect'ric Power 
eb'rnjany,"'"'~b'ftn 'TiiMI: 
30,000,000 tons of coal 
annually in the production 
of electric power for more 
than 1,600.000 customers in 
seven states. Company 
management, too, has read 
"several articles, quite 
laudatory," on sulfur re- 
moval from coal that have, 
unfortunately, proved quite 
worthless. 

Earlier this month, I&amp;M 
announced plans to invest 
$15 million in a promising 
demonstration unit at its 
Tanners Creek generating 
plant at Lawrenceburg for 
the removal of sulfur dio- 
xide and nitrogen oxide 
emissions on a 150,000 - 
kilowatt coal-fired boiler. 
It is a $15-mlllion gamble 
on a relatively small gen- 
erating unit; should it prove 
successful its adaptation on 
machines ten times larger 
would cost proportionately 
more. Research on this 
project has been continuing 
since 1968 and the 
effectiveness of It will not 
be know until 1974 or later. 
But this is only one 
generating unit and our 
company has dozens of 
varying sizes which means 
that equipment has to be 
specifically designed for 
each unit, taking time, 
whcih Is what the I&amp;M 
advertising says. 

Hopefully, Dr. Gottlieb's 
students are taking the time 
to study what he refers to 
as 'both sides."

The character of change 
In America, that process 
where what is becomes 
what will or should be, has 
dradtically been altered In 
definition and application. 
Today we are confronted 
with. In many cases as- 
saulted by, the almost 
divinely held assumption 
that change In and of It- 
self denotes 'good.* 

This belief in the Inherent 
"goodness" of change leads 
Co reason that only those 
facets of our lives that 
are producing changes, or, 
are In a flux of change, 
can be good. Therefore It 
Is assumed that to produce 
more good we need to pro- 
duce more change, paving 
the way for an accelerating 
process where our In- 
creasing appetite for good 
can only be satisfied by 
an Inceaslng rate of 
change. However, our ex- 
periences with artificial 
rapid change have left us 
more hungry, not satisfied. 

The popularly held belief 
in the Inherant goodness 
of change derived its back- 
bone from the radical 
movements of the 60's. We 
heard over and over again 
their alarmist cries for 
change, change merely for 
its own salce. That today, 
to believe in the goodness 
or even the posslbilty of 
goodness in an established 
institution brings accusa- 
tions of reactionarylsm, 

-(■^wp'H ■ .i-i-\-,c,T -&gt; ,-.. -^ •;-...•-.. &lt;■- 

sexism, racism or any 
other -ism- the left de- 
cides to throw at you. 

Change, if it is to be pro- 
ductive, must be evaluated 
on the results It produces. 
If the results show im- 
provement over a present 
situation, then change Is 
desirable and should be 
implemented. If change 
produces only satisfaction 
for the changer and does 
not benefit the change then 
this form of regression 
, must be rejected. For 
change to be of value. It 
has to improve the cir- 
cumstances it is dealing 
with. 

Another aspect the radical 
establishment has given us, 
is their own special brand 
of resistance to change. 
They have become In- 
trenched in their own mire 
by refusing to admit when 
their own changes have 
failed. Unchecked, un- 
questioned valueless 
change creates cancerous 
conditions, whether In the 
human body or in the human 
brain child called society.

"We need a 'Tcai salesman" 



Beyond freedom or determinism; 
writer examines B. F. Sicinner 



For the sake of conveni- 
ence, we shall consider 
B.F. Skinner to be the most 
outspoken proponent of de- 
terminism within the realm 
of the social sciences. All 
science (the social sci- 
ences included) makes the 
(at least) tacit assumption 
of being deterministic. 
Skinner, however. Is most 
frank about the centralicy of 
its position In his system. 
Our focus on Skinner will 
be concerned with the Im- 
plications of his determin- 
ism for social science. 

For Skinner, the social 
sciences should not con- 
cern themselves with the 
inner thoughts and volitions 
— i.e., mental processes — 
of human beings. Instead, 
the emphasis must be 
placed on their behavior — 
i.e., what they observably 
do; since we would never 
ascribe the actions of In- 
dependent "minds'* to the 
seemingly chance gyra- 
tions of electrons spinning 
around a nucleus, we should 
likewise not do so with hu- 
mans. , . . 

In order to change or shape 
behavior. Skinner insists 
that we need three things: 
we need a 1) stimulus for 
the occurrence of a 2) be- 
havior which must be fol- 
lowed immediately by a 3) 
reinforcement necessary 
to the maintenance of chat 
behavior. These three 
components are linked to 
each other to form a be- 
havioral Inlt and this is in 
turn linked toother behavi- 
oral units. 

The resulting "behavior- 
al chains" can be schema- 
tized as follows: behavior 
that can be observed, mea- 
sured by, or Influence a- 
nother body. 

In his most recent book. 
Beyond Freedom and Dig- 
nity, Skinner proposes that 
man construct a technology 
of behavior based on the 
behavioral components he 
has outlined. It seems then 
that for Skinner, man Is a 
respondent and nothing 
more. He implies that 
given all the variables of 



an Individual's present 
state of behavior, we can 
predict with absolute ac- 
curacy what the future be- 
havior of that individual 
will be. (As we have pre- 
viously seen, Newton said 
the same thing with res- 
pect to Che physical world.) 
The technology of behavior 
for which Skinner argues 
so cogently muse come a- 
bout in order for man to 
reach a scientific under- 
standing of himself. Skin- 
ner's aim is to reduce to 
certainty human behaviour 
that has historically baf- 
fled psychologists, histori- 
ans and sociologists, as 
well as the man on the 
street. At this point we can 
see that what Einstein tries 
to do with physics. Skin- 
ner is trying to do with 
social science. 

We find that sociology 
makes the same assump- 
tion of determinism (al- 
though, perhaps, not In the 
same way) In its study of 
human group behavior. 
Berger states that the evi- 
dence for "...freedom Is 
not empirically available." 
In the same book, Berger 
says on another page: 

It is.. .Idle to expect that 
scientific methods will 
be able to uncover free- 
dom by some procedure 
of elimination, piling up 
causes on causes until 
one arrives at a resi- 
dual phenomenon that 
does not seem to have a 
cause and can be pro- 
claimed as being free. 
Freedom Is not that 
which is uncaused... 
Freedom is not unpre- 
dictability. 

This strikes us as being 
true. Just because we can- 
not predict with certitude 
the behavior of electrons 
at subatomic levels does 
not mean chat these elec- 
trons are somehow "free. " 
But Berger goes on to say 
that just because a person 
may be "conscious" of his 
freedom does not mean that 
he is free and that any- 
way this". ..Is not subject 
to scientific Investiga- 
tion." Berger's paradigm 



here Is the standard "par- 
ty line" of sociology. It 
Is Important to realize that 
sociology has attempted to 
become "scientific" and 
one of the hallmarks of 
"hard" science — to- 
ward which sociology 
strives — Is the funda- 
mental assumption of de- 
terminism In nature. If 
this is so, then we cannot 
help but conclude that this 
science (i.e., sociology) is 
highly limited because, by 
his own admission, Berger 
says that freedom may 
exist but that it Is outside 
the province of science. 
Therefore, a sociologist 
assumes determinism In 
his work, but is It Indeed 
true that determinism is 
a real thing? And, if it is 
not, what does this say a- 
bout the ability of science 
to offer a complete des- 
cription of manand his 
environment?

This year It appears that 
one of the outstanding stu- 
dents at I-PU Is Apathy. 
Apathy Is majoring in 
nothing In panlcular and 
many times can be seen 
loitering In the halls out- 
side the classes that he 
cuts. He very seldom goes 
to class and therefore is 
better known to the students 
than to his professors. 

Apathy tried out for the 
flag-football team recently 
talked Into It by his fellow 
classmate Encouragement. 
Actually Apathy despises 
Encouragement and If he 
could world knife him in 
the back which he does 
dailly anyway behind his 
back. Well Apathy dropped 
off the team after one game 
which his team lost. Dis- 
couragement easily talked 
him into that by pointing 
out a few of his teams 
poorer qualities which A- 
pathy is always looking for 
Co please his friend Excuse. 

In another month or so 
Apathy will be facing finals. 
Apathy isn't sure about 
the exact datesofhlsflnals, 
but he Is confident of pass- 
ing especially with friends 
like Encouragement around 
to help him. Unknown to 
Apathy though Encourage- 
ment and Dldcouragement 
over control of Apathy who 
they know Is easily swayed. 
However, Apathy knows he 
is good looking and If all 
else fails, he knows that 
this will get him by. How 
can he go wrong?

Student Services 

Academic Development and Counseling Division 
Seeks More Contact With Students 



Dr. Charles Bofyard Summarizes the Division 



The Academic Develop- 
ment and Counseling 
Division functions for you. 
Dr. Charles Bolyard and 
his associates seek to help 
individuals better under- 
stand themselves: their 
motives desires, and goals. 
Through this division are 
available vocational and 
educational Ir.ventorlesand 
tests which allow the stu- 
dent to explore and experi- 
ence areas new to him, 
and thus to know himself 
better. Also available are 
aptitude tests, personality 
inventories, and achieve- 
ment tests. 

Another phase of the work 
done by this.divlsionisthat 
of counseling. This in- 
volves academic, personal, 
and career counseling. 

Working with Dr. Bolyard 
In an associate director 
position is Bob Craig 

assisted by Donna 

Brandt, Also involved in 
this area are Mr, Bill 
Heller in Career Develop- 
ment and Placement and 
Mr. Bill Chavis, whose 
concern is cne non-typical 
student: those with special 
needs. 

The services of the coun- 
seling and testing center 
are available to all stu- 
dents and former students 
of I-PU at Fort Wayne or 
any other campus. An in- 
dividual may on his own 
request help from these 
offices or he may be re- 
ferred to this division by 
others with whom he is in 
contact. 

The procedure followed in 
the counseling and testing 
center has three steps. The 
first of these is in the form 
of a talk with the student 
about where he is and where 
he thinks he might want to 
go. Based on this the 
counsellor and student 
determine together which 
tests he would like to take. 



by Anita Lamos 

In the second session these 
'tests are administered. 
This might take several 
hours, depending on the 
tests themselves. Dis- 
cussion of the test results 
is the third session. The 
object of this session is 
to make some assumptions 
in connection with the test 
results and provide the stu- 
dent with a "ground" - to 
produce a better under- 
standing of himself. 

This particular type of 
counseling is basically chat 
of helping the student with 
direction. However, this 
rather superficial coun- 
selling may reveal a need 
for personal and social 
oriented counseling. Ad- 
justment counseling for 
students who may have 
some difficult problems to 
overcome Is another phase 
of the work here. There 
are time and ability limits, 
however, and so referrals 
to mental health agencies 
and psychiatrists are made 
when the situation 
warrants. 

In the future Dr. Bolyard 
would like to begin working 
with students at the time of 
registration and continue 
with them in a develop^ 
mental capacity thoughout 
their university experience 
This would also include 
an expanded placement 
division, possibly in- 
cluding a course in career 
development. Special 

remedial services to help 
students develop the basic 
skills in reading, math, 
etc. to enable him to do 
college-level work are 
also envisioned. 

As seen by Dr. Bolyard, 
the purpose of thisdivision 
is to complement what is 
being done in the class- 
room. In this capacity they 
are helping the student to 
develop In ways other than 
the classroom-oriented in- 



tellectual development. 

When the Student Union 
is completed part of this 
division will move there 
to a much-needed suite with 
expanded facilities. 

Also in the future is a 
llason with the clinic ser- 
vices to be offered by the 
Psychology division This 
would provide a bi Dader 
area of counseling through . 
cross-referrals. 

The counseling and testing 
center is charged with ad- 
ministering tests of the 
national testing programs, 
such as the College Level 
Examination Program, the 
SAT, National Teacher 
Exams^ etc. Students who 
have not been able to take 
certain national tests on 
the date provided may make 
arrangements through this 
office for the test. Informa- 
tion about other tests and 
test sites is also avail- 
able. For information or 
an appointment call Mrs. 
Carla Long in Dr. Bol- 
yard's office at 482-5656 
or room 106 in the main 
educational building. 

Chuck Bolyard does not 
limit himself to testing, 
counseling, and coaching, 
however. Although these 
are the things which seem 
to consume most of his 
time, he still finds time for 
teaching, chairing com- 
mittees, giving counsel to 
business and industry, and 
listening to music of 
Debussy, Devorjak,Sibelius 
and a few other classical 
composers. 

Dr. Bolyard is most 
anxious for this division 
to be all that it can be 
to the students. If you need 
help In some way there is 
some one who is ready 
and willing to be of ser- 
vice. Make use of the 
Academic Development and 

Counseling Division it is 
there for you and Its free.

Tuesday night, Nov. 29, 
the Tuskers continued with 
their city tournament style 
and easily put away Ohio 
State, Lima. It was their 
first regularly scheduled 



home game and it drew a 
crowd of 49 fans, not count- 
ing cheerleaders, score- 
keepers, and referees. Ten 
of those fans were from Ivy 
Tech^ who were beaten 
handily by our reserves, 
68-56. The Ivy Tech play- 
ers were only planning on 
watching thefirstpart of the 
game, but they were so 
awed by the style of our 
Mastodons that they stayed 
for the entire game. 

Tom Berning led all scor- 
ers with 23 points, followed 
closely by Don Chaney with 
20. Mike Rich pumped in 
14 points. Rex Putt let it 
all hang out with 12 points. 



and Gary Trump added 11. 
Bruce Haines scored 6 
points and everyone else 
on the team except Terry 

Gach contributed 2 points 
each. 

The Mastoaons are a well 
balanced team this year and 
the games are exciting to 
watch. Even when the play- 
ers aren't on the floor the 
cheerleaders keep the show 

rolling iwht some high spir- 
ited precision cheers. 
Good team, exciting 
games, what more could 
you ask for? Next home

Low-cost tutoring available now 
through Student Government 



Having a hard time In 
chemistry? How about Eng- 
lish or math? 

The Indiana-Purdue Stu- 
dents* Government, real- 
izing the need for low-cost 
tutoring on campus, has es- 
tablished the Student Tu- 
toring Program. The pro- 
gram is designed to meet 
the needs of slurt' its hav- 
ing difficulty in 20 differ- 
ent subject areas. 

Serving as tutors will 
be outstanding students 
selected by the individual 
department chairmen on 
the basis of high profi- 
ciency in their area. Any 
IPU student Is eligible for 
the tutoring service. 

A fee of two dollars 
per hour will be paid 
by students being tutored, 
a relatively low charge, 
considering a department- 
al tutor costs five dollars 
an hour. 

Richard Peffley, chairman 
of Special Projects In Stu- 
dents' Government, is in 
charge of the program. He 
has kept busy compiling the 
first complete list of tu- 
tors in every department 
of both universities. Ex- 
plaining the purpose of the 
project. Rich said, "We 
hope to see students who 
might do poorly or flunk 
succeed through student ef- 
fort and at a minimum 
cost." 

The Student Tutoring Pro- 
gram win officially be ini- 
tiated today, December 1. 
Areas in which tutors can 
be received are as fol- 
lows: 

History, PU English, 
chemistry, philosophy, 
dental auxiliary education, 
•speech &amp; communications, 
computer technology, bio- 
logy (cell, micro, and nur- 
sing technology), audlo- 
logy, music, math, and 
mechanical technology. 

Also psychology, theater, 
lU English and linguistics, 
political science, French, 
German, Russian, SparUsh,

EXPAND YOUR MIND 
. . . READ 




It always amazes me when 
I stop to think about how 
much good music there is 
In this world that I'm not 
even aware of. A friend 
plays an album by some ob- 
scure band (or person), and 
zap- Its really good. I walk 
Into a record store; some- 
thing I like a lot Is playing, 
and zap- I buy the album. 
It's so frustrating to buy 
two or three albums a week 
and still want to buy five 
Qr six more. A person could 
go broke fast, besides not 
having enough time to lis- 
ten to a record collection 
that grew by five or six al- 
bums a week. 

Adding to the music 
lovers' dilemma I s the 
ever-present friend, ac- 
quaintance, or miscellan- 
eous-type personwhols 
totally in love with a record, 
and says, "You must buy 
this album, someday you'll 
thank me for telling you 
about it". True, many 
times they're right, but 
sometimes it's only anal- 
bum they'll play for five 
days, and then sell for 751;. 
I know, I've done it myself. 

A couple of the best solu- 
tions are 1) working in a 
record store, and 2) having 
many rich, record-buying 
friends. Ho we ver, these 
answers are in many cases 
impossible. So, I'vedeclded 
that the best thing to do is: 
read as many record re- 
views as possible, learn 
which critics know one end 
from the other, (according 

Black and Blue 

by Sue Perrine 

"Lady Sings the Blues" 
Is a movie that Is more 
then just a movie. It Is a 
story that touches the heart 
with all the happiness and 
compassion that went with 
BUlie Holiday. 

Billie Holiday was a 
powerful singer with a weak 
will. She sang her way to 
fame, but was brought down 
by drugs. Being a success- 
ful young black jazz singer 
in New York City 1936, 
was almost hopeless, but 
Billie Holiday made it. 
Singing at Carnegie Hall 
was the ultimate In her 
career. The disappoint- 
ments along the way were 
too much for her though. 
She became hooked on mor- 
phine. 

Billie Holiday's boyfriend. 
Louis McKay played by 
Billy Dee Williams, was 
her only hope. He helped 
her as much as he could, 
but sheilding her from all 
the disappointment was 
impossiable. Her death was 
pathetic and a loss never to 
be regained. 

As the advertisment 
states, "Diana Ross is 
Billie Holiday." She play- 
ed her part with such force 
that she was the real Billie 
Holiday. No actress could 
give more to any part in 
any show then did Diana 
Ross. 



by Dave Hill 
to your personal tastes, 
of course), borrow lots of 
albums, and stop buying al- 
bums because the cover 
looks good. This should cut 
down considerably on the 
number of lemons pur- 
chased. Of course, it will 
also destroy the mystery, 
suspense, and Impulsive 
fun derived from going on 
a record-buying splurge. 
And you never know what 
fantastic music you might 
run into by buying on im- 
pulse. 

Which all reminds me of 
my original purpose in 
off the strength of some 
good reviewer, the advice of 
some guy who was trying 
to sell me the record, and 
the fact that I'm partial to 
saxophones. The album is 
El Pampero by an Argen- 
tine tenor saxophonist 
named Gato Barbierl. It 
was recorded live at the 
1971 Montreux Jazz Fes- 
tival (Switzerland), in front 
of an audience that had hung 
on till 4 a.m. just to hear 
Gato. 

The best thing a bout 
Gate's music is the urgent, 
intense feeling it conveys. 
He throws out a steady flow 
on his horn, displaying re- 
markable time, tone and 
pitch, and occasionally e- 
voking sounds that eerily 
resemble human voices (or 
screams). 

Lace this with the speed- 
ing percussion Fiction con- 
si sting of R- etty Purdle 
(drums). Sonny Morgan, 
(congas), and Na-Na (per- 
cussion, berimbau), add 
Chuck Ralney's driving bass 
and the swooshing, raining 
rhythms and melodies of 
L o n n 1 e LIston Smith on 
electric piano you get one 
hell of an album. 

If you like music that com- 
mands your complete at- 
tention, (It's jazzifyoulike 
categories), this record's 
for you. Side two Is fast be- 



coming the best side on any 
album I've heard. (Person- 
al opinion, mind you). Take 
my advice, buy it. 

Someday you'll t h a n k me 
for telling you about 
it. Really.

Cagers deserve recognition 



Philadelphia is not where it's at! 

If you were an avid pro- 
fessional sports fan, which 
city would you most like to 
live In? New York? Los 
Angeles? Chicago? Those 
would all be wise picks. But 
which city would you most 
wish to avoid? Think hard 
and then. If you haven't al- 
ready, consider Philadel- 
phia. 

This time of year you'd 
probably want to go see 
your beloved football Ea- 
gles play at beautiful new 
Veteran's Stadium. Right? 
Maybe. But keep In mind 
that the Philadelphia Eagles 
are 2-8-1 thlsyear andcel- 
lar dwellers In the NFC 
East Division. Even so 
you'd stlU probably conde- 
scend to watch them on the 
tube when they are on the 
road. Right? Well, last week 

the Eagles flew to New 
York to take on the Giants. 
They lost 38-10: In theflrst 
half. By the sound of the 
final gun, most of the TV 
sets In Philadelphia were 
long since turned off. There 
long since turned off. The 
final tally: 62-10. 



Oh well. There are always 
the Philadelphia 76ers of 
_£hs. J?J.B4^_Ba.ske.cbail may- 
not be as popular as foot- 
ball, but it's a decent se- 
cond. Everywhere but Phil- 
adelphia. The 76ers have 

wone one game and lost 

21. Even the Eagles could 
whup the 76ers. 

How about hockey? You 
have two teams from which 
to choose. The NHL Flyers 
are fifth in their seven- 
team division. The World 
Hockey Association Bla- 
zers have many top-name 
skaters. Including former 
Boston Bruin Derek San- 
derson, who is working off 
of a $1.3 million contract.. 
Derek claimed earlier this 



season that the Blazers 
were the best. So far they 
are (by far) the worst. Their 
slate stands at 4-16-0 
which puts them dead last 
in the WHA East Division. 

So It looks like the avid 
sports fan in Philadelphia 
will just have to wait until 
the national pastime rolls 
around next summer. 

Now wait a minute! I've 
got to be kiddingr The Phil- 
adelphia Phillies in 1971 
were the WORST team In 
the major leagues, losing 
more than a hundred games 
in the strike-shortened 
season. They were so piti- 
ful that when the attendence 
was announced at home 
games, the fans booed I I 
seriously think last year's 
Indiana-Purdue squad could 
have riddled the Phillies! 

But the hapless Phillies 
did have one very bright 
spot in their 1971 cam- 
paign. This of course was 
flamethrowlng Steve Carl- 
ton. Carlton won 27 ball 
games, tops in the majors 
and nearly half of hisclub's 
total victories. He walked 
away almost by unanimous 
vote with the coveted Cy 
young Award. 

Even Steve Carlton may 
not' be around next year.... 
with the Phillies, that is. 
Three National League 
teams are doing all they 
can to lure Carlton away 
from the Phils. The bait? 
More raw, untested rookies 
and perhaps a throw-in or 
two. Just what the inept 
Phillies need. 

So If you do happen to go 
to Philadelphia In the near 
future to live, visit, or just 
pass through, take some 
sound advice: don't men- 
tion pro sports to anyone. 
If you do, you won't have 
to worry about going to any 
games. 



Komets on the rise? 



In the past couple of sea- 
sons Fort Wayne fans have 
been treated to mediocre 
hockey by the Komets. But 
this year the K's are look- 
ing great. After a slow 
start in which they dropped 
five of their first six, the lo- 
cals have convincingly 
bounced back to win twelve 
of their last sixteen con- 
tests. The K's have a firm 
hold on second place on the 
IHL South Division and are 
mounting what hopefully 
will be a serious threat to 
overtake the perennial 
first-place Dayton Gems. 
Student admission to Komet 
games is $1.50, and that is 
Che best bargain anywhere. 



Where are the Muskegon 
Mohawks, the terror of the 
IHL for years? In the cel- 
lar of the IHL North, that's 
wherel I don't know what 
has happened to the power- 
ful Mo's, but their 5-16-2 
slate Is unreal. So is the 
18-6 record of the third- 
year Flint Generals. They 
are running away with the 
IHL North Division top 
spot, but it's still early. 

Try to catch a Komet 
hockey game In the near 
future. But if you can't 
make it, flip on WO WO and 
get the good play-by-play 
report from Bob Chase, 
Smokin' Dugan Fry and Doc 
Dancer 



The Indiana-Purdue Bas- 
ketball Mastodons have now 
played seven games and won 
only two of them. The ave- 
rage fan or student would 
say that this Is par for our 
team and it looks like we're 
in for another poor season. 
I can't go along with such 
an attitude. 

Our team has played se- 
ven games, but not one of 
those games has been play- 
ed on their home floorl Our 
first scheduled home game 
was on Tuesday, Nov. 29, 
but our men had to play that 
game at Concordia College, 
which was just as strange 
to them as It was to the op- 
position. Being able to play 
a game in the same gym that 
you practice in Is a definite 
advantage-an advantage that 
our team has thus far been 
deprived of. 

The Mastodons opened 
their regularly scheduled 
season by traveling to An- 
derson and playing Ander- 
son College. I didn't attend 
the game so Ican't say much 
about It. But I can say that 
Gary Trump swore that It 
was the most physical game 
that he's ever played in. He 
received more bruises and 
shot less foul shots than 
ever before. Gary wasalso 
the high scorer in that game 
with eleven points. Denny 
Blankenbecker came off t h e 
bench and scored ten points. 
Tom Bernlng pumped in 8 



by Paul Jacquay 

points, and "Slim" Woeb- 
beking slopped in 7 while 
Don Chaney added 6. Mike 
Rich and Kent Rosenberry 
scored four points apiece; 
and Bruce Haines, Steve 
Yahn. Terry Gach, and Rex 
Putt scored 2 each, leaving 
Roger Spice the only mem- 
ber who didn't contribute to 
our final total. We lost 87- 
58,. 

The following night the 
Mastodons visited North- 
west Business College at 
Lima, Ohio. The Tuskers 
played good team ball the 
first half and led at the 
break, 44-43. But the se- 
cond half was a different 
story as the team fell apart 
under the pressure of a 
zone press topped with su- 
perb, sometimes unbeliev- 
able, shooting by North- 
western. Final score: 104- 
86. 

Don Chaney led our scor- 
ing attack with 22 points, 
while Gary Trump, Kent 
Rosenberry and Denny 
Blankenbecker added 14, 10, 
and 10, respectively. Tom 
Bernlng and Steve Yahn 
scored 8 each, with Rex 
Putt and Roger Spice add- 
ing 4 apiece, while Terry 
Gach, Bruce Haines, and 
Bob Shrlner contributed 2 
each. 

Friday night the Tuskers 
opened the Fort Wayne City 
College Tournament and got 
it a 1 1 together against Con- 



cordia by posting a 91-74 
victory. They played great 
team l^all, and were in con- 
trol during the entire forty 
minutes of playlngtlme with 
balanced scoring, good ball 
control, and fair rebound- 
ing. 

Tom Bernlng led our scor- 
ers with 20 points, while 
Mike Rich added 16, Gary 
Trump 14, Don Chaney 12 
and Rex Putt 10. Keith Woe- 
bbeking scored 8 noints-6 
for I. P. and 2 for Concord- 
ia. Bruce Haines scored 6 
points, Denny Blankenbec- 
ker added 3, and Kent Ro- 
senberry and Rex Putt con- 
tributed 2 each. 

The next night the Mas- 
todons found themselves 
playing against Indiana 
Tech with the Fort Wayne 
City College Championship 
at stake. The Tuskers were 
up for the game, and their 
teamwork showed it. They 
outplayed Tech, they made 
Tech look sick In all cate- 
gories except for one- 
shooting. One of Tech's 
players, Lowery, made 14 
out of 16 shots from 25 to 30 
feet out. You can't beat that 
kind of shooting, no matter 
how well you play. The Tus- 
kers lost the game, 92-63, 
but they showed us that they' 
ve put together a team 
that's well worth watching.

K^s 2nd despite home game jinx 



TAKE CARE, SPORTS FREAKS! 



The Fort Wayne Komets 
are winning on the road at 
the out-of-town rinks but 
are having difficulty input- 
ting together a winning ef- 
fort at the Coliseum. Win 
or lose. Fort Wayne hoc- 
key enthusiasts are in full 
support of the K's as evi- 
dent in the average atten- 
dance of 5,600 at the Coli- 
seum. Tlie K's are pre- 
sently in second place in 
the south division of the 
IHL with 26 points. The 
division leader Is the Flint 
Generals with 34 points. 

The Komets had a fine 
opportunity to close the gap 
on the leading Flint Gen- 
erals this past weekend but 
ending up splitting the two- 
game series with a 5-4 
loss here and a 5-4 vic- 
tory at Flint. The Komets 
will not meet Flint again 
until late December; thus, 
capturing of first place in 
their division will depend 
on the Generals to contin- 
ue a losing streak. This 
Is doubtful as the Generals 
have the IHL's leading 
scorer, Wayne Zuk. 

The scoring of the Komets 
is lead by Wayne Ego with 
nine goals and 18 assists. 
Ego is also the center of 
the K's most productive 
scoring line with Chick Ba- 
lon and Bob Miller on the 
wings. Several of the K's 
have come out of scoring 
slumps lately with recent 
goals such as Ron Ullyot, 



by Leo Herendeen 

Glen Toner, and Dean Sher- 
emata. Although the game 
scores do not indicate the 
pressure the Komets have 
placed on the opposition's 
goaltender, the K's have 
placed more shots on goal 
than they have allowed on 
their own net. This Is 
quite a change in reflec- 
tion of earlier games of the 
season when Robbie Irons 
was being stormed by fly- 
ing pucks in the K's nets. 
A tremendous aspect of 
the Komets has been the 
outstanding playing of the 
rookie goalie, Don At- 
cheson. The rookie goalie 
has a perfect record in 
games played of seven 
wins, no losses, and no 
ties. In the perfect rec- 
ord, Atcheson I '.d a shut- 
out and the los st average 
of goals scored against in 
the league, 1.82. 'he goalie 
has many duties i additon 
has many duties ii addition 
to keeping the opposition 
from scoring; he must keep 
the area clear in front of 
his nets by occasionally 
moving the opposing play- 
ers aside and Atcheson at 
6'4", 200 pounds is able 
to move even the larger 
players aside. The goalie 
is also In charge of keep- 
ing the defense organized 
and must remain in con- 
stant attention to any pos- 
sibilities ofpentaltieswhen 
an extra player can be ex- 
changed for the absence of 



the goalie. 

An opportunity to have a 
snapshot taken with a 
Komet player occured this 
past week at the Coliseum. 
Camera buffs were out In 
force as the K's may now 
be a bit bllnky from flash 
bulbs. This promotion is 
expected to be repeated la- 
ter In the season If mis- 
sed or more snapshots are 
requested. 

The Komets have settled 
down to regular lines and 
barring any injuries will 
remain the same. This 
will allow more accurate 
passing and hopefully more 
wins. The K's are still a 
serious contender in their 
division and should start 
to have a better showing 
at the Coliseum. 

The next home games are: 
Dec. 1 - Saturday - Dayton 
Dec. 9-Saturday-Columbus 
Dec. 16-Saturday-SagInaw
