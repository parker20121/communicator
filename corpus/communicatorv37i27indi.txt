Tired, cold and sore as my tears

My head turned from the sky,

A police car drove by, yet there 
we remained, unnoticed. 

My wrists bruised, my shirt torn,

Pear Mother Nature, 



Tor lhal. don't you think? 

You have three months to give us 
SHOW and that's your limit. There are 
lour seasons, and 12 months in Ihc 
ycur-you know this. So you can't 
just go around making it snow in 
April all because you're having a b.nl 



hot ones, so this year, ean you actu- 
ally give us spring ' It would he much 
appreciated, not only by me, but by 
the rest of the world, loo. 

Please remember how much ev- 
eryone loves spring. People are out 
more, they start having neighbor- 
hood barbecues again and they just 
lighten up, because the weather is so 
nice and you just can't sit inside. 



People become more active and all of this without your cooperation! 

begin to work off the winter blahs So please, please, please, give us 

and the weight they gained when some beautiful weather! I know you 

they were sitting around inside glued have it bottled up somewhere in stor- 

to the I V. Even a professor of mine age. 
recently commented on how he saw a 

dad and son flying a kite one day and Love, 

how he wanted to do exactly that- Michelle- 
good old-fashioned fun. 
again, we simply can't do 




all through March to let the tem| 
s go up, which allowed the s 

slop Ihen. 

Not only is it April, but it is also 
he time of year to be planting for 
r and fall harvest, However, 
it plant because the ground 

The cold temperatures have been 
mpossible to bear. It's like 
when I was little and got something 
really cool, only to have it taken 
away the next day because of a safety 
recall or someihing. I'm left, empty-

Seeing 'Meet 
the Robinsons' 
is definitely in 
your future 



What will the world be like in 

30 years'? Technology is advancing 
at a faster rate than ever before, so 
the next 30 years will yield more ad- 
vances ihan the last 30 years by far. 
The idea of this is both scary and ex- 
citing in many ways. Perhaps ihal is 
why the concept (it time travel seems 
In periodic-Lilly pop up in mainstream 
movies every so often. 

Who doesn't like "Back to the 
Future"? Don't actually answer thai. 

In "Back to the Future 2." we gel 
a glimpse of a potential 2015 full of 
Hying cars. Inonic implants and hover 
hoards (as opposed lo skate boards) 
When I saw this in 1989. I thought, 
"Wow, 1 bet all of that stuff will be 
around 26 years from now." Well, we 
are only eight years from that right 
now and something tells me I won't 
have a hover board by then. 

Maybe I'll have the hover board 
in 2037— the year depicted in Dis- 
ney's "Meet the Robinsons." 

The movie focuses on a 12-year- 
old orphan named Lewis. Lewis is

views, which hasn't worked lor him. 
feeling rejected and defeated, it's as 
if his life will never amount to any- 
Unbeknownst to Lewis, a man 
from the future is watching him. He

Lewis" most important invention in 
an attempt lo change the course of 
history. He is followed through lime 
by a 13-ycar-old boy named WiUvr 
wlio hetnends Lewis ,md brings him 
into the future. Once there, Lewis 
meets his family: hence, "Meet the 
Robinsons." From this point on, you 
will either love the movie or hate it. 

Perhaps, in an attempt to make the 
future seem as quirky as possible, the 
movie is everywhere alt at once. It is 
almost like being on a roller coaster.

let's be honest, 

made for idealists. This movie was 

made for kids and they will enjoy it. 

I saw it with a 6-year-old. who had a 

blast. 

I was able to enjoy the movie as 
well, but my adult mind couldn't help 
bui think of the paradox involved 
with what I was seeing (I say this as 
il I actually know what I'm talking 
about when il conies to the concept 

Honestly, if you don't like it, it 
will more than likely be as a result 
of the all-at-onccncss. Some pans. 
while imaginative, are nonsensical. 

However, by the ending. I think 
most people will appreciate the mov- 
ie. It is enjoyable and like most Dis- 
ney animated movies, it leaches :i les- 
son about life, family and patience I 
might be a better man now. 

The art and animation is amazing 
as usual, as we have come to expect 
from Disney, so I don't believe any- 
one will he disappointed by the cin- 
ematography. 

In Fort Wayne, we have the op- 
tion ol seeing 'Meet the Robinsons" 
in Disney Digital 3D. I recommend 
tins approach as the 3D effect really 
is compelling This effect is achieved 
in the traditional fashion with a split 
image and a pair of glasses with 
lenses that Idler out one image or the 
other. If tins doesn't sound appeal i ng. 
then choose the non-3D version as 
the movie will give you a headache 
if you try and watch it without the 
glasses. 

AH I know is that I hope the fu- 
ture really does have singing frog- If 
you have kids, take them to see this 



The Seven Deadly Sins are found at Henrys 

Area artist gives his take on human nature through portraits 



The seven deadly sins are con- 
cepts that people being honest with 
themselves will see displayed in their 
lives at some point or another. This 
is a strong statement to make, but it 
lias been backed by years upon years 
of artwork. From novels to music to 
movies and much more, human na-

Now. a local artist is giving liis 
take on the seven deadly sins with his 
art show on display at Henry's, lo-

them until he felt he could express 
them as porirait-hased photographs. 

Each of the sins (greed, pride. 
lust, wrath, sloth, envy and gluttony I 
are individually represented with 
their own portrait, and can be found 
on the left wall inside of Henry's. 

If Henry's seems like an interest- 
ing venue to display such a gallery. 
There is a reason why Henry's is so 
appropriate lor displaying this show. 
According lo William. "1 think that

the idea first began." Spoken like a
