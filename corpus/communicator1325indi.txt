opinion 



DGTS ignores 
students' future 



'Express' 

If unicorns could talk 



The Division of General and Technical 
Studies' "Phase-out" program, designed 
to reorganize DGTS and modernize class 
techniques, has created problems for 
many siudcnls 

" Students presently enrolled in DGTS' 
programs have been assured lhal their 
credits will transfer Into the new 
Programs, but those who wish to return 
.b school must expand their degrees 
from two-year associate degrees to four- 
year bacca laureates may find that they 
musl retake as many as 90-100 credit 
hours just to bring themselves up lo 
Purdue standards. 

j These students, when they began their 
also assured that their 
credits would be transferable. Now 
many of them feel that IPFW ad- 
ministration has shown a lack of concern 
toward them 

; The Communicator agrees. 
■ Students who wish further education 
should be encouraged by a university, 
tjut have roadblocks thrown in their way. 
' Provision should be made for those 
students who wish to return to college 
and enhance their education, 
their chances of 
getting a better job and add to the 
community as a whole. Provision should 
be made now, before project "Phaze- 
oul" is completed. 
; But what about the next I 
. Every lime alterations are made in 
academic programs, some students fall 
between the cracks. A lot is said about 



"safely nets" these days, how about one 
for displaced students? 

Two old bugaboos lie at the root 'of the 
present problem: poor counseling and 
the lack of academic separateness for 
IPFW 

A beginning student's first experience 
with higher education is with an 
academic counselor. Whether through 
misinformation or indifference, many 
students were told lhal classes would 
transfer when in fact they would not 

Trusting their counselors, students 
went about their way, only finding out 
the truth when it was often too late. 

Every student has at least one horror 
story about bad counseling, but here is a 
where an entire group of students 
are caught in the same nightmare. 

Also, there is still too large a gap 
between IPFW and the main campuses. 
The best answer, of course, would be to 
offer more classes and degree options 
here, so thai students would not have to 
be so concerned with the requirements 
igtonor Lafayette. Then IPFW 
could set more of its own requirements 
and programs could be drawn up so that 
the students could move easily from a 
two-year lo a four -year degree 

Until IPFW has its own identity, and 
equal academic freedom from BOTH 
parent campuses, problems 
Problems lhal all too often will lead lo 
disillusioned students and a poor 
university image.
