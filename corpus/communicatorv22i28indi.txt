Earth Day 

People of this planet 
must halt destruction 

Neither by the light of reason nor by divine 
right can we continue to rationalize our daily 
destruction of this planet by claiming owner- 
ship. 

At some point in relatively recent history, 
humans stopped being tenants of Earth and 
assumed the role of landlord. From that day 
— every day — with a sense of entitlement so 
perversely grandiose and exclusively human, 
we have mercilessly pounded away at the 
delicate shell containing all the life we know 
to exist. 

How many "Earth Days" will pass before 
we recognize and acknowledge the source of 
this scourge — the human race which has 
overpopulated, overmanipulated and under- 
compensated the fragile environment in 
which we live. 

We are at the point where it's no longer a 
question of "do we want to pass this problem 
on to our children?" because out of the lust 
for profit and convenience, there will be no 
place on Earth fit for our children to live. 

The theme of last Saturday's event was 
"Earth Day is Every Day." If, every minute 
of everyday, we do not realize that simple 
maxim, then every day will be hell on earth. 

Then, once a year we would celebrate "Hell 
Day," complete with visions from Dante's 
Inferno of humans wallowing in their own un- 
recycled waste, burning crisp under an ozone- 
less sky and suffocating from an atmosphere 
of pure carbon monoxide. 

We all know this list of atrocities which 
daily bombard Bio-sphere 1: Acid Rain, 
massive deforestation, toxic dump sites, nu- 
clear waste, oil spills and so on. 

If we assume the role of landlord, then we 
should also shoulder the responsibility of that 
position. Let's leave this planet the way hu- 
mans first found it for the next tenants. Let's 
think about the voiceless creatures that suffer 
now from our abuse. Let's stop rationalizing 
our wasteful ways by claiming superiority 
over nature. We are nature, and we are 
screwing ourselves.
