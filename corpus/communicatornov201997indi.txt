$5,000 reward ap for grabs 



By Susan Spindler 
News Editor 



W i I h 

/'^ rougbly a 

^^J^ month lefi in 

^^^^^^L ihis 

^^^^^^^k and finals week 

^^^^^^ ihreais have nei- 
iher decreased nor stopped 

And wiih the frequency of bomb 
threats on ihe nsc. the IPFW admin- 
isiration and campus police have 
jipped [be ante 

i There is now a reward for 
$5,000 for information leading (o 
the airesi and conviction of the per- 
son(s) involved with caJling in the 
ccnlinuous threats. 

This semester, there have been 
18 bomb threats (as of press time) 
Thai is over a month's worth of a 



three credit bour cla&amp;s 



In hopes of solving the problem 
the univcrsuy installed a new phone 
system with caller ID included, 

"The new phones help but the 
calls are coming from pay pbtmes all 
around town." said Lieutenant Tom 
Haner, 

"Easlside. South. North, it's 
completely random," 

The university has decided to 
face the bomb threats from another 
side. 

The policy of IPPA' is that there 
can be either mandatory evacuations 
or optional evacuations. 

So far this semester there have 
been only mandatory evacuations, 
but thai has changed as of this week. 

"We have two choices: manda- 
tory evacuations or optional." said 
Walt Branson, vice chancellor of 
financial affairs 

"We go through a threat analysis 
to detemune what option to use." 

"If we have decided to classify it 
I optional then notices are handed 



out to professors and announce- fessor should g 



menis are made." said Branson. 
"The individual chooses whether or 
not to leave the building " 

Some students feel that the 
optional evacuations are not going 
to solve the problem and in ways 
make tlie bomb threats their problem 
and not the university's. 

"If there is a bomb threat, there 
is a bomb threat," said Viktor 
Sekulovski, an IPFW student 

"That's so stupid! If a bomb 
went off and I was 'optionally' there 
I would sbli die." said Wasim Huq, 
IPFW student 

"It's (heir problem They aren't 
going to gamble with my life." said 
Abiy Solomon, an IPFW student. 

If the professor deodes to con- 
tinue with class, the students that 
leave are not to be punished for that 
decision 

According to Fenwick English, 
vice chancellor of academic affairs. 
the prof&amp;ssor must let the snjdeni 
make up a lest or quiz and the pro- 



with the shident that they may bave 
missed. 

"If the student leaves (due to a 
bomb threat) there will be no penal- 
ties," said English. 

Other campuses across Indiana 
have not experienced the contmuous 
bomb tlireais IPFW has. 

Neither lUPUI, Indiana State 
University, Ball State University nor 
Indiana University have had a smglc 



bomb threat this semester, according 
to their campus police representa- 
tives 

"We had one just last week, but 
nothing like the problems you folks 
are having." said Captain Steve 
Dietrich of Purdue University 
police. 

"We have had a couple of threats 
but nothing out of the ordinary," said 
John Wiecker of Fort Wayne 



Community School's security. 

For finals week there will be 
"plan B's" for final exam locations 
in case of bomb threats 

No one will know the alternate 
buildings to be used to avoid bomb 
threats. 

If you have information about 
those involved with the bomb 
threats call campus police at 481- 
6827. 



Charges filed, no decision yet 

School 01 education, dean named In grievance 



I any material 



By Nol Becklev 
EtMTon 

The lU faculty board of review 
al IPFW has recommended Beiiy 
Steffy be removcjj as dean of educa- 
tion to remedy the situation con- 
cerning Sieffy and M Gail Hickey. 
associate professor of elementary 
education, according to Mickey's 
attorney, 

Steffy said she did not want to 
conunem on this issue 

Cynthia Rockwell, Hickey's 
attorney, said Sieffy has consistently 
dealt with Hickey diflTerently than 
with other professors m the school 
of education 

"Dr. Steffy has put roadblocks 
in the way for everything Dr. Hickey 
does." Rockwell said 

Rockwell said proper proce- 
dures were not followed m student 
complaints with Hickey Hickey was 
left out of a session when students 
voiced complaints against ber to 
Steffy. 

Rockwell also said Steffy treat- 
ed these complaints formally when 
nothing had been put in wnong 

Some of the problems. 
j Rockwell said, came from the fact 
s that there are no checks or balances 
Hon Sieffy because her husband is 
f Fenwick English, vice-chancellor of 

(academic affairs 
There were supposed to be cer- 
tain measures in place to avoid 
[nepotism, but as of Monday, no 
measures have been enacted to pre- 
vent this, according to sources 

All deans except for Steffy 
report to Enghsh about their dcpan- 
ments or schools. 

Rockwell said the board of 



review said in a 24-page report that 
they bebeved academic freedom had 
been violated and a hostile work 
environment had been created 
Along with removing Steffy, the 
board recommended Steffy and 
Hickey attend something that would 
help them work together, reimburse 
Hickey for her attorney fees and 
Ughten ber class load next semester 
ID allow Hickey to recover. 

The next step in the grievance 
procedure would be to wan for 
Chancellor Wartell's decision He 
has 30 days to make a decision on 
whether to reject or deny the griev- 
ance after be receives the board's 
recommendations, 

Wartell said it would not be 
appropriate for him to comment on 
issues that are still being decided, 

C&gt;n Sept 26. the board met for 
13 hours to hear the evidence con- 
cerning Hickey's gricvaiKe 

Mary Helen Thuente, chair and 
professor of English and hnguisiics 
and a member of the faculty board 
of review, said she could not com- 
ment on the board's decision, but 
said Hickey's grievance concerned 
academic freedom, harassment, 
equitable treannent. promotion and 
salary 

Thuenie also said the nature of 
the charges brought forth by Mickey 
alleged that Steffy directly affected 
the relationship between Hickey and 
her students 

Dunng the nine months the 
board has dealt with Hickey's griev- 
ance, several problems have affect- 
ed the board's invcsUgation. 

"There have been unprecedent- 
ed obstacles from the administra- 
tion." Thuenie said 

Thuente said the board did not 



want to comment nor could they 
comment on ibEir recommendation 
until the chancellor makes his deci- 
sion The report will be in the library 
after Wartell's decision 

Another grievance that ihe 
school of education is facing has 
been filed by Carol Aikman, coordi- 
nator and assistant professor of sec- 
ondary education. 

Aikman said she was denied 
tenure despite being qualified 
according to the last policy in the 
school concermng tenure and pro- 
motion 

"I was floored when 1 didn't get 
it" sbe said 

Aikman's tenure hearing look 
place when English was promoted 
from dean of education to vice- 
chancellor of academic affairs. After 
English left education. Steffy 
became dean, assummg her hus- 
band's former post at the university 

Aikman said Sieffy supported 
her promotion, but English was 
against it. English did not have a 
vote during the process 

English told Aikman her tenure 
was denied due to a lack of focused 
research agenda. 

"They've changed ihe rules," 
Aikman said. "I was caught in the 
transition" 

Since Steffy became dean, 
Aikman said the department has 
improved 

"Whenever we need something 
new we get it," Aikman said. 

Aikman said she is concerned 
about the students and how the 
recent happenings have affected 
them. 

"I'm beginning to see the stu- 
dents don't mailer to the administra- 
tion," Aikman said. 




Grievance policies disputed 



Bv Susan Spindler 
News Editor 



The faculty at IPFW tried lo 
accommodate both sides of die um- 
versity to have a universal gnev- 
ance policy but the hopes of that 
have burned out. 

There are ibrce major differ- 
ences between die Purdue policy 
and the Indiana policy 

Indiana allows the faculty to 
have an attorney present at the hear- 
ing. Purdue does not 

The Indiana side has public 
hearings and the faculty has the 
right to request any documentation 
and. by mandate, they must be 
turned over to them 

Whereas, on die Purdue side 
both are optional 

The idea of having one griev- 
ance policy for IPFW faculty was 
rejecied by both the lU and Purdue 
main campus presidents 

Some faculty members were 
hoping that there could be a unified 



"There are differences but, I 
continue lo argue my preference to 
have the same (policy) at IPFW," 
said Jim Hersberger, spokesman for 
the Purdue faculty, 

There are things thai 
Hersberger does not agree with in 
the Purdue policy 

"I don't like the advocate situa- 
tion. 1 performed that function in 
past." said Hersberger. 

"In the new policy the advocate 
is barred from speaking They can 
give advice bul aren't allowed to 
make stale men is" 

"Both parlies have to want it 
(the hearing) to be open. I prefer it 
to be up to the faculty," said 
Hersberger. 

For some faculty, on eidier side. 
It may be best to use the Purdue pol- 
icy when deahng with certain griev- 
ances, according to Fenwick 
Fjigli.sh. of the VCAA office 

Because Purdue Is the manag- 
ing agent for IPFW. in matters of 
administration Purdue is the 
stronger hand 

A management agreement 
between Purdue and lU allows 



Purdue to. in a sense, run the cam- 
pus. 

"The faculty of IPFW should 
use Ihe Purdue policy when tbey 
have grievances concerning work- 
ing conditions," said EngUsh. 

"The legal counsel for lU has 
slated that it would be a good idea 
in their opinion," said English. 

If, however, the grievance has 
to do with promotions, tenure or 
non-reappoinimeni then the faculty 
should use their school 

"Then Purdue should use 
Purdue and lU use IU."said 
English. 

Much of Ihe dispute stems from 
Purdue President Steven Beering's 
decision not to meet face to face 
with the grievance committee after 
he renders a decision 

Beering's written response 
would be all that is needed accord- 
ing to his interpretation of the gnev- 
ance procedures. 

Several faculty senate members 
expressed dismay of Beering's 
interpretation at the Oct. 13 faculty 
senate meeting

Transitional studies fills campus needs 



a pan of something bigger 
Unfortunately, we are the only cam- 
pus experiencing the unjust events 
of continuous bomb threats 

According to campus police 
representatives from lUPUl, 
Indiana Stale University and Ball 
State University there have been 



To THE Editor: 

In my yearsof lutonng at IPFW. 
1 have seen a lot of people come and 
go. Many of these people would not 
have graduated without Transitional 
Studies' tutoring service However. 
recently here at IPFW, there has 
been some criticism of this service 

Accusations have been that 
Transitional Studies does not pro- 
vide all the services it advertises, 
tutoring is not available, tutors 
break appointments without suffi- 
cient nonce and lutors are not pre- 
pared lo tuior some subjects. To 
answer these accusations, we must 
first look at what the tutormg ser- 
vice is and what the responsibilities 
of each person involved with the 
tulonng service are. The tutoring 
service is provided FREE for stu- 
dents. 

The university employs stu- 
dents wbo received good grades to 
tutor other students. Each student 
can receive up to two hours luiuring 
each week per subject. This is in 
addition lo the free drop-in tutoring 
sessions available in Keliler 1 18 and 
202 at posted times. 

The goal of the tutoring service 
is not to be a crutch Instead, the 
goal is to make each student suc- 
cessful and independent 

Now we must look at ihe 
responsibiUties of a tutor Every 
tutor paid by the university follows 
a SCI of rules. Those rules are: 
1 Work toward the independence of 



one's students 

2. Use positive encouragement 
always. 

3. Never do assignments for the stu- 
dents, 

4. Call students if one must change 
an appointment, 

5. Check one's ^pomtment book 
daily. 

6. Erase daily appointments as Uiey 
are kept or canceled. 

7. Leave a number or place where 
one can be found. 

Students being tutored also 
have responsibilities Every student 
who receives tutoring through 
Transitional Studies must follow 
these rules: 

I Fill out a tutoring application. 
2, Sign up for each appointment by 
matching one's fee time with time 
available on a tutor's schedule. 
3 Sign up for only one appointment 
at a lime 

4. Make appointments 24 hours in 
advance. 

5 Meet tutors in Kettler 202 
6. (!!ancel an appointment two hours 
in advance. If one fails to do this 
twice, tutoring wdl be denied for the 
rest of the semester to that student. 

Further, students being tutored 
must come prepared, have a positive 
attitude and remember thai tutors 
are students with demanding sched- 
ules, too. Now that responsibilities 
are clear. I can respond to the accu- 
sations The accusations arc 
Transitional Studies does not pro- 
vide all the services it advertises or 



that tutormg is not avaibble. tutors 
break appomtments without sufTi- 
tient notice and tutors are not pre- 
pared lo tutor some subjects 
Transitional studies advertises that 
ii provides tutonng for snidents by 
students in mosi subjects here at 
IPFW. The key word is most. 

One musi realize that there are 
nearly 12,0005tudenls and 300 fac- 
ulty members along with more than 
20 different subject areas here at the 
university Further, one must under- 
stand that if no student is available 
to or if one is not available to tutor a 
specific subject then that service is 
not available Transiuonal Studies 
tries to cover areas of need bul 
sometimes does not succeed. 

This leads to the next com- 
plaint. How many of us have ever 
had to call in sick to wortc? In my 
years of tutoring, I have only can- 
celed two appointments, once for 
my oldest child's sickness and once 
two weeks ago wbcn I bad the flu. 

And most of my coUeagues in 
the tulonng service have canceled 
about the same amount of appoint- 
ments. These situations are going 
to occur. However, a tutor canceling 
two appointments in three years 
does not ever compare lo the num- 
ber of luiees canceling without 
notice two appointments on one 
semester. This leaves the last com- 
plaint: lutors are not prepared for 
some of the subjects. Fust one must 
again consider that there are more 
than 20 subject areas. 



1 

And in each subject area. Ihere 
are many different classes In math- 
ematics undergraduate classes, there 
are more than 20 different courses; 
Finding tutors who are prepared to 
help in all of these courses is diffi- 
cull, especially since most of the 
tutors are students themselves., 
Although tutors do their best, some- 
times ihey must say, "I'm sorry, 1 do 
not feel comfortable tutoring this 
subject, I think you would be better 
helped with a different tutor I know 
someone who can help you in this 
subject area " It is a tutor's duty to 
point out to a tulec that he/she can't 
help with certain questions 

One can see Ihe accusations 
made toward Transitional Studies 
arc really unfounded. Transitional 
Studies does a fantasuc job of cov, 
ering the classes they can with the 
lutors available. Because of this, the 
lutoring service in Transitional 
Studies is consistently ranked bigb 
compared with other umversitys' 
tutoring services nationwide^ 
Remember, the tutoring service is 
here to help IPFW students. And if 
any student feels the service is not 
working, then Ihe student needs to 
see Martha Weatherford or Sally 
Fitcb in Kettler 202. 1 know person- 
ally that they are always looking tor 
ways 10 improve the tutoring ser- 
vice.

Wayne Mr Kruse spent most of 
the summer matting these beautiful 
artworks to share wiih you during 
this, bis last year of teaching at 
IPFW. They are a tribute to his skill 
as a teacher, both because of his 
array of styles, skills and expres- 
sions they convey and because he 
valued them enough to save them 
and to share them with you. 

There is nothing about these an- 
works thai is amateur or "student 
work," Each piece is of the highest 
professional quality and some of 
them will take your breath away

Bomb solution dangerous 



To THE Editor: 

With tbc abundant amount of 
bomb threats we have received 
within the past semester, it has 
beciHne apparent to most of Ihe stu- 
dent body that they are a few dis- 
turbed individuals among us. Not to 
say that they arc wackos, just a little 
immature 

Well, our school has finally 
come to lis senses They have final- 
ly found tbe solution to the bomb 
threats. We can all stop worrying 
. . . right? 

Wrong. 

It has come to my aitenuon that 



the student body has been left m tbe 
dark by our fellow administrators. 
They really think they have come up 
with the solution to the problem . 
do you really want lo know? 

According to credible sources, 
the new policy will involve the 
affected building passing out papers 
to all teachers in the building to read 
to his or her class (no alarm) Frtxn 
there, the building will be under vol- 
untary evacuation. Yes, you read 
that right, voluntary. 

I don't know about you, but 
when a bomb ihreai is in effect 1 am 
out of tbe building before you can 
say "IPFW," 

What happens when there really 



s a bomb? As far as I am concerned, 
this new policy is a lawsuit waiting 
to happen. 

(5ne day . , top story in the 
news . , , BOMB/NEW POLICY 
LEAVES 378 DEAD AT IPFW , , . 

Is this what the university wants 
lo see? I think it's time for someone 
10 sit down and actually figure out a 
plan that will work without having 
the possibiUiy for potential harm or 
DEATH, Let us not put anyone ih 
danger, because someday these 
threats will be a reality.

Questioning the value of a life

way again '^Anonymous 

My husband and I have speni the 
last three (lays in one hell of a funk. 
We've been trying lo decide whether 
lo have our beloved two-year-old 
black Labrador Rcirieva, Andre. 
pui down If you're not familiar wiib 
the term, "put down" means to have 
him pui 10 sleep This is the most 
lerrilying and painful decision that 
I've ever had to make in my life, 
because ifs causing me to question 
the power of taking a life, and Uie 
impact that doing so will have on 
my soul. 

Last week, this beautiful creature 
that has done nothing but faithfully 
love me since the day that we 
brought him home. Then be snapped 
at a little boy who was playing 
snowball -catch with hmi. Tlie two 
had been playing for a few minutes, 
but when 1 stopped their game to 
take my other dog (Brenna. a 
German Shepherd) inside, Andre 
lunged at the httle boy's band to 
grab a snowball he was still holding. 
And he snarled when be did iL 

I was shocked, and then, fright- 
ened. Tbis bad never happened 
before Lately he has been more 
aggressive than usual to strangers at 
the door, which is unlike him. but be 
had never, ever tried to hun anyone 



before, lei alone a child. I made an 
excuse to the little kid. who wasn't 
the slightest bit upset about (he 
whole thmg. and went mside, visi- 
bly shaken. 

I sat down with my husband and 
we assessed the situation immedi- 
ately This dog normally wants noth- 
ing more than love, love and more 
love. He's physically hyperactive, 
and demands a large amount of 
exercise and attention, much like a 
child wiih Attcntion-Deficil- 
Hypcractiviiy Disorder 

Through the years, we've just 
grown accustomed lo the fact that 
there are cenain situations where be 
just cannot control himstlf. This Ls 
pan of Lfe with Andre He has a lot 
of energy, but that's who be is And 
we like bun that way. To Andre's 
credit, he has taken obedience 
courses, twice, and was a model stu- 
dent each time He was the instxuc- 
lors favorite in his second class He 
behaves like an angel around us and 
around other dogs 

It se«mcd to my husband and me 
that he's just been antagonized one 
time too many by the unsupervised 
children that live in my neighbor- 
hood, and 1 think that he's lost all 
patience with children as a result. 
Ben (my husband) and I knew that 
we'd have to give bim away when 
we bad children, because he's loo 
active to be around small children. 
but we never thought thai he'd force 
us to question our plans so drastical- 
ly, so early. 

I'd like to let the record stale thai 
I'm siaunchly against putting ani- 
mals down for behavioral problems. 
That's just the lazy person's way out 
of taking responsibihty for training 
a peL Besides. I firaily believe that 
animals have souls and that tbey feel 
pain. But aggre&amp;sion like this is a 
problem thai cannot always be fixed 



through training. I know this 

because I'm sort of a closet animal- 
bebavjonsL It's more than a hobby 
with me — it's my passion. As a 
result of my studies. I know how to 
recognize the signs of aggression — 
I just never thought that 1 would 
have to sec it m my own peL 

So, morals, knowledge and all, 
here I am, ready to bave an animal 
that I love more than life itself put to 
sleep because I am afraid that be'll 
hurl someone .someday. But the only 
one who's hurling right now is me. 
I'm actually considering whether or 
not to lake this buddy — this 
friend — who's loved me for over 
two years and protected me from 
strangers so well, and do something 
to him that I am both morally and 
spinlually opposed to. 

The images that thought evokes 
in me are horrifying. I know that 
he'll sit there thinking that be's 
being kenneled for the weekend 
while his Mommy and Daddy go on 
another vacation Bui this time we 
won't come back, and those lovuig 
brown eyes will refuse to lose their 
luster, and be'll wail patiently, like 
be always does 

A few days later, when no one has 
come to claim his beautiful form, a 
stranger will take bim into a room, 
and give bim one of those damn 
injections that he hates so much, and 
he'll go to sleep and he won't wake 
up. HLs last thoughts will be that 
we'll still come and save him and 
take hun home to bis warm kitchen 
lo play with bis litUe sister and 
chase the cats that be despises so 
much But for the first time ever, we 
won't come back 

Ob. bow that image tears ai my 
soul. I'll have lo live with the guilt 
of knowing that I purposely killed 
bim, and I'm not sure that I want 
that power It hurls too much, I don't

know how anyone can kill a human 
being, because the way Uiat I feci 
about what I'tn only tbinking about 
doing to my dog, and whal thai deci- 
sion's doing 10 my heari and sflul. I 
could never choose lo hun a person. 
I just couldn't live with myself 

The power lo lake life is just too 
heavy a burden to bear. I fed this 
cuddly bundle of energy, trained 
him dJligendy. shanng his joy when 
he learned all of bis commands and 
njshed bim to the animal hospital 
when he was ill I did, and contmue 
to do. all those things out of love 
Uncondtiional, boundless love, 
wbich he always returns to me, 
never asking for anything more than 
food and a few tummy scratches 

He's never betrayed me, bul I'm 
actually thinking about betraying 
him in the most unforgivable way 
that exists If I do this. 1 guess that 
I'd be killing bim because I love 
him too much to lei him do some- 
thing that's so natural for a dog 
who's trying to protect himself, bul 
so wrong in the human world That's 
what I'd really be doing, isn't it? 
ICilling bim? It lakes my breath 
away just to admit it now. even after 
hours of thinking this over. 

I don't know how this decision 
will end Maybe by the time thai this 
goes 10 print. I'll have made a 
choice that 1 won't be so damned 
ashamed of. God knows that I don't 
want to make ihis choice anyway 
But I know that what I want lo do 
and what 1 have to do aren't com- 
patible, as much as I'd like for them 
to be. 



1 never thought that I'd have to 
contemplate taking a life, but here 1 
am, considering it, while my loyal 
pet sleeps his forever-trusung eyes. 
There's a pan of me that ftels eVil 
suddenly. And I don 't like it

'Bad asses' that we lore 



Bv NoL Becklev 
Editor 



Severn issues ago. me and my 
gang of misfii toys, delved into the 
world of good guys in movies 

But wbai makes a hero? 

For every bigger than life hero, 
there needs to be an equally (and 
q)posiie)evil villain. 

To be t&gt;elievable. die villain 
musi be somewhai likable and 
chariijnaLc. 

■ The besi vdlains have 10 create 
a bit of pity and an enjoyable darker 
side. 

Mosl movie-goers have picked 
up on this fact and bad guys who are 
(Hily one dimensional bore us. 

We detnand a cutming viUain 
who charms die socks off of us 
while trying lo blow up some kittens 
or decapitate some nuns. 

An example of a crappy villain 
would be Tommy Lee Jones as 
"Two-Face" in "Baiman Rewnis." 

He was made 10 look worse 
because he was overshadowed by 
Jim Carrey's "Riddler." 

Without further stuff 10 bore 
you we may as well embark on our 
sacred journey ttirougb the rogue's 
gallery al the cinema. 

• Hannibal "The Cannibal" 
Lector from "Silence of the 
Lambs." 



I stiJI have nightmares afler see- 
ing this movie. It's the same dream 
every time. 

He invites me (o dinner and the 
only thing on the plate is Farver 
Beans. 

• Gary Oldman in "The 
Professional." 

Oldman's drug using DEA 
agent is perfectly set against Jean 
Reno's hitman with 3 hean 

Oldman is corrupt and 
viJe, but he has a &lt; 
something thai make; 
want 10 like him agamst

JudgmenL 

• Kevin 
Spacey in 
"Seven." 

Spacey 
amazes and 
disgusts us 
by murder- 
ing seven 
people 

according to the seven deadly 
sins. 

1 can't remember whai they are, 
heU, I can't even remember the 
seven dwarfs 

Spacey rewrites the book on vil- 
lains in Ibis movie. 

• Rob Lowe in "Bad 
Influence." 

Lowe befriends James Spader in 




this drama that makes a serious 
social commentary on the "Reagan 
80s." A decade of greed and me and 
videotapes. 

As cute and cuddly as Lowe is. 
m this film be somehow pulls off a 
vicious villain. 

• Al Pacino as Michael 
Corleone in "The 
Godfather." 

Pacino takes us through the 
transformation of Michael as 
the baby of the family to new 
patriarch. 

We see him as a 

naive soldier back 

from World War II 

and watch as he 

assumes the reigns 

of power from Viio

Sutherland in 
Eye of the 

Needle." 

Sutherland plays 
Nazi spy stationed in 

England. "The Needle," 
Sutherland's code name, gets wind 
of the Normandy invasion and tries 
warn the Fatherland, 

Sutherland is a cool, calm and 
calculated killer who can charm Lhe 
garters off a princess. 

• Juliette Lewis in "Natural 
Bom Killers." 



The black widowesque Lewis 
draws in men and swifUy takes their 
life for [be hell of iL 

But what man doesn't wani to

Some vUlains who didn't make 
it for one reason or another (mostly 
because wc haven't seen the film 
and someone outside of our cUque 
recommended them) are Orson

Banish turkey boredom this Thanksgiving 



By Shelley Porter 
CuuNAHV Reporter 



Looking for someiliing a In- 
tie more inleresting than (be 
iradilional Miracle Whip, 
iceberg leliuce and Icfinvcr 
turkey sandwich aTier 
Thanksgiving this year? 
Look no further! 

Below are three awe- 
some sandwiches thai art 
easy lo make, delicious to 
eat and so vancd, you may 
not realize that you're eating 
leftover turkey for the gazil' 
lionth time 

Calypso Club 



/ pound cream cheese, regular, 
iow-fat or fat-free, softened 
I 8'Otmce can crushed pineap- 
ple, well-drained 
1/2 pound bacon, regular or 
turkey 

Leftover turkey, thinly sliced 
Raisin bread 

Dice the bacon and fry until 
crispy Drain very well 

Beat the cream cheese until 
hghi and fluffy. Beat m the pineap- 
ple and bacon. 

Chef's Note: Ibis makes a lol of 
cream cheese spread, but don't 
worry The leftovers will go in a 
hurry. It's delicious on crackers as a 
study snack. 

Toast two slices of raisin bread 
per sandwich. Spread one slice of 
toasted bread w iih the 
pineapple/bacon/crcam cheese 
mixture. Top wuh the thmiy sliced 
turkey and the remaining slice of 
toasted bread. Cut diagonally and 



Country Ibrkey 
Grill 



This sandwich is 
delicious, but packs 
in some 




Fair warning: This sandwich is 
best made with homemade 
coleslaw — you know, shred the 
cabbage, make a cream-and-may- 
onnaise dressing — but who has 
lime 10 do that? 

Substitute a deli slaw or make 
one from the pre-packaged shred- 
ded coleslaw mix and dressing 
available in the produce depait- 



/ pound creamy cote slaw 

8 ounces Swiss cheese, sliced 

regular or fat-free 

Leftover turkey, thinly sliced 

Dell ham, thinly 

sliced (optional) 

Rye bread 

Butter

Lightly butler two sLces 
of rye bread Place one 
slice, builer side 
down in a preheat- 
ed non-stick 
) skillet. Layer 
with turkey. 
ham (if using). 
and Swiss 
cheese 




Top with the other layer of bread, 
butter- side up. 



■•Grill" the sandwich until nice- 
ly brown on the bottom, then ilip 
over. When that side is also 
brown, remove imm skillet, 
open the sandwich from the 
meal side and top with a 
spoonful of coleslaw. Cut 
into fourths and serve 
immediately 

If you like, you can add 
the coleslaw before grilhng 
the sandwich, but it is a little 
messier. 



California Tbrkey 
Club 

Chef's Note: This non-traditional 
version of a club sandwich is 
enhanced with the creamy taste and 
feel of a ripe avocado 

Putting the bacon and a slice of 
bread between the avocado and the 
tomato makes for a less "slippery" 
sandwich 

Leaf lettuce (not iceberg)

sliced

1/2 pound bacon, regular or

Foreman returns to ring 



This week at IPFW 



Dirti/ Laundry: Tony Laux 




Taking a page 
from "RetuiD of 
I he Living 
Dead," George 
Foreman, age 
48. returns to 
Ihe ring this 
Saturday againsi 
heavyweight 
Shannon 
Bnggs At age 



24. Bnggs 



young CTough lo be Foreman's son, 
Eitiicr Foreman is the worsi gambler 
in the world and needs the money lo 
pay off his debts or he has been bit 
in the head so many times he thinks 
people actually care wether he 
boxes or not 

•Let the trades begin!! With the 
Major League Expansion Draft, here 
are the top 5 things to expect in the 
coming months: 

5 More "has beens" like Eddie 
Murray and Lee Smith getting calls 
about their availability. 
4. Salaries for players going higher 
Lhan Bill Clinton's future legal fees. 
3. More overrated Japanese pitchers 
laughing all the way to the bank 
because some idiotic owner will 
sign him for millions, even though 
they haven't proved themselves in 



Ihe majors 

2. Trivia geck&lt;; that nval the freaks 
that talk about Star Trek asking 
questions about who was drafted 
firit or what was the opening day 
lineup for the clubs. Get a hfe!!! 
1 The Cubs losing 

•Colts Win!! Colts Win!! It only 
look eleven weeks but the only team 
in Indiana worse than the one in 
Bloomington fmally got a win Ihc 
next thing you ungrateful fans will 
do now is expect is another win this 
season At least ihis gives the Bears 
a chalice to gel ihe first pick m the 
NFL draft and blow it on smother 
wortUess player 

■He went through hell lo win il. but 
Jeff "Flash" Gordon captured his 
second Winston Cup Title in three 
years by Tmishing 17th at the NAPA 
500. In becoming NASCAR's first 
5 million dollar man. be had to over- 
come wrecking his pnmar&gt; car. 
qualifying 37th out of 43 cars and 
barely holding off Dale Jarrelt and 
Mark Martin to win the title by a 
scant 14 poinLs, 

•The national championship race 
hasn't gotten any clearer and with 
the upcoming opponents, it doesn't 



look like anything is going lo 
change in the rankings. Michigan 
needs to beat Ohio State No prob- 
lem And II needs to win the Rose 
Bowl to stake its claim to the tide. 
Nebraska needs to beat Colorado, a 
team that the Sporting News picked 
;is the preseason fll team showing 
Ihat not every publication has intel- 
ligence in lis polls. And it needs to 
win the Big 12 champioaship and a 
probable matchup with Florida State 
for its claim. Meanwhile Florida 
Slate needs io beat the overrated 
Florida Gators, win the ACC cham- 
pionship and then beat Nebraska. 
Got that?? 

•There will not be an officii "beer" 
of the 2002 Winter Olympics The 
"fun police"' in "Mormontown" 
have nixed the idea and now it is the 
official "Mall beverage " due to the 
pressures of the anti-alcohol 
activists, A rumor that appeared 
after this story was that Billy Dee 
Williams was quite upset when he 
learned thai he wouldn't be able to 
continue his 'successful" television 
career. 

•College basketball has started and 
Purdue and Indi^ina arc going in 
opposite directions 



Indiana proved diat they need to 
start their search committee for a 
new basketball coach with a lacklus- 
ter effort against lemple Who the 
hell ranked them in the Top 25?'.' 
Purdue is 2-0 out of the gate and 
ItHiking like a real contender for a 
national championship Nowifany- 
btxly could teach Keady how lu stop 
gelling advice from Bert Reynolds 
and Marv Albert on toupees 

'Top five reasons lo fire Dave 
Wannstedt: 

5. Rick Mirer. Dave wanted him, he 
got him. 

4. Rashaan Salaam. Don'i ever draft 
allcisman Winner 
3. Alonzo Spellman. Another over- 
rated Ohio Slate lineman. 
2 His non-existent coaching skill. 
1. Because I am lired of losing'!!!!
