Sept 11 

New holiday 
established to 
remember 
those lost 



On Dec. 1 3 



President George 
signed an amendment that des- 
ignated Sept. II as "Patriot 
Day": a holiday to honor those 
who were killed in the terrorist 
attacks and aftermath. 

In his proclamation of 
Patriot Day in 2002, Bush 
wrote, "We will not forget the 
events of that terrible morning 
nor will we forget how 
Americans responded in New 
York City, at the Pentagon, and 
in the skies over Pennsylvania - 
- with heroism and selflessness; 
with compassion and courage; 
and with prayer and hope." 

The president requests 
that Americans observe a 
moment of silence at 7:46 a.m. 
local time, marking the exact 
moment of the anniversary of 
the first hijacked plane striking 
the World Trade Center three 
years ago. 

Dedications include fly- 
ing flags at half-staff and can- 
dlelight vigils. 

The "9/11 Lights On" 
campaign asks Americans to 
drive with their headlights on 
during sunlit hours, to pay 
respect to those lost in the 
attacks. 

Local events memorializ- 
ing thu day vary. 

"We just leave that up to 
the (individual) schools." she 
said. She did say, though, that 
government classes will dis- 
cuss the topic, and that younger 
children "will discuss it in age- 
appropriate ways," said Debbie 
Morgan. Morgan is the 
spokesperson for Fort Wayne 
Community Schools.

The pains of Labor 



In recent years, 
workers unions 
keep losing 
members, clout 

By Gregory Starks 
and Jennifer Griggs 
The Communicator 

The fight for labor rights 
in America began in 1882 with 
uprising of 20.000 workers in 
New York City, which led to 
the modem day union move- 
ment, according to the AFL- 
CIO (American Federation of 
Labor and Congress of 
Industrial Organizations). 

Workers paraded up 
Broadway and demanded an 
eight-hour workday, instead of 
the arduous 10-12 hour days. 

among lower- wage workers. 
This was just the beginning of 
the workers' rights movement 
as known today. 

Among area celebrations 
honoring workers, is a picnic at 
the UAW recreation center on 
U.S. 27 and Indiana Stale Road 
33 from 1 1 a.m. - 4 p.m. 
Monday. The picnic is free and 
open to any union members and 
their families.

Take for example a quote from 
the Revolutionary Workers 
Online (littp //rwor.org): 

Call forward the many. 
many millions who deeply hate 
the Bush Agenda to be part of a 
protest that is RELEVANT and 



VISIBLE and a MASSIVE 
REPUDIATION to everything 
Bush concentrates and is doing 
to our country and our planet." 

In a word: Yikes. I guess I 
never took politics as seriously 
as Ihe fine people of RWO do. 
Apparently, discussion isn't 
enough in a democracy. 

But to the protestor's cred- 
it, they are getting organized, 
and I do feel slightly guilty for 
laying on the crazy talk so 
thick. Take the example of 
www.a3l.org, the website that 
called for a day of protest on — 
you guessed it — August 31. 

"Here in New York, we 
will converge on Madison 
Square Garden, the site of the 



ill-gotten gains of Republicans 
will be celebrated. ...We'll take 
over the streets- transforming 
them into stages of resistance 
and forums for debate. We'll 
draw our examples and inspira- 
tion from the brave shapers of 
history who came before us... 
We want more than speeches 
and protest pens. We want 
change. We want to take 
democracy from the 

Halliburtons and Enrons and 
bring it back to town halls, 
schools, and neighborhoods." 

Ill-gotten gains? A child- 
ish and easy insult. Halliburtons 



and Enrons? A bit overused, 

And I think we all know 
that when they say "debate." 
that is the furthest thing from 
their minds. If any Republican 
dare speak his mind at one of 
those protests, he will be in dan- 
ger of serious bodily harm.

In the aftermath of the

Is there really a point to 
picking a major? I ihink not. 

The question I heard most 
often my junior and senior 
years of high school was, "So

My answer was always, "I 
don't have a clue." This was 
followed by a look of disap- 
pointment and "Oh, you have 
plenty of time." Iwasl7years 
old and I was supposed to know 
what I wanted to do with the

IPFW services teach students to learn Capitol 



Three types 
of assistance 
available 
on campus 

By Amy Kline 
The Communicator 



The t 






students 



Free services are here for 
the taking on campus at IPFW. 
but some students may not even 
know ihey exist. 

Two organizations, CASA 
(Center for Academic Support 
and Achievement) and ACCS 
(Academic Counseling and 
Career Services) offer free 
assistance to students, and 
another organization, CELT 
(Center for the Enhancement of 
Learning and Teaching) offers 
free assistance to educators. 

"The main function of 
CASA," said Jane Ehle, 
CASA's assistant director, "is in 
the name: academic support for 
the students." 

CASA offers free tutoring 
for many classes at IPFW. A 
sludent is allowed two hours of 
free onc-on-onc tutoring per 
week, according the school's 
website. Appointments must be 
made 24 hours in advance, but 
students may receive immediate 
help for some courses at sched- 
uled drop-in sessions. 

CASA offers assistance 
with reading, writing, math and 
study skills. 

STEPS {Student 

Technology Education 

ProgramS) is also provided to 

computer-mediated communi- 
cations they need for college 
and beyond," according to their 



"B" in the class that ihey intend 
lo tutor. They also must get an 
instructor's approval, and 
receive proper training. 

CASA"s website is at 
www.ipfw.edu/casa , or may be 
reached at 481-6817. CASA 
itself is located in Kettlcr Hall. 
in room G23. The Writing 
Center is also in Kcltler Hall 
Room CI9. 

Doug Ncitzel is the direc- 
tor of ACCS. He said the organ- 
ization helps students who arc 
"between majors" or who are 
undecided about their major. 
They can help students to raise 
their GPAs, or they can help 
students who arc doing well in 
school to "make thai informed 

ACCS provides academic 
testing, such us the placement 
tests required for admission to 
IPFW. They also offer off-site 
testing for IU Bloomington. 

They help students "to be 
a proper fit" with the degrees 
they choose, said Ncilzel. By 
the lime a sludent becomes a 
junior or a senior, ACCS oficn 
talks with ihem about intern- 
ships, co-ops and pan-lime jobs 
to help the sludent after gradua- 

They encourage students 
to lake leadership positions on 
campus, such as sludent gov- 
ernment posilions, or to become 
active in clubs or organizations 
relating lo their chosen fields. 

Ncitzel pointed oul unfor- 
tunately, some students need the 
money they may be earning 
from regular, paying jobs, and 
may noi be able to give up ihose 
jobs to do unpaid work - even

ACCS helps to prepare 
students for the job search once 
Ihey graduate. They review stu- 
dents' resumes, advise students

"We're determined to find 
the best college Texas no-limit 
hold'em player in the world," 
said the event's host, well- 
known poker player and best- 
selling poker author Lou 
Krieger. 

And with sponsorship 
funds from online poker giant 
Royal Vegas Poker, this year's 
College Poker Championship is 
offering $40,000 to the winner.

amounting to $10,000 will be 
made to any chanty or organi-

Indiana University and Georgia

our schedule has been hard, but 
this year looks to be the hard-

don't get our butts kicked in a 
couple of games, but it could

Ritchey said

old record for the 5K. 

Ritchey talked to coaches 
at Eastern Illinois and 
Hillsdale, but found more

Mike Fruchey. 

"I was interested in staying 
close to home," said Ritchey 
"(It) just kind of seemed to

When Ritchey arrived at 
IPFW, she came ready. 



"I had kind of prepared 
myself for it mentally," said

Ritchey takes this in stride.

An official in the IPFW ath- 
letics department has con- 
firmed that IPFW will face 
Notre Dame during the 2004- 
05 men's basketball season. 

"It's true," the official said. 
"We are going to have a press 
conference." 

However, another official in 
the department said nothing has 
been confirmed but negotia- 
tions were ongoing. 

Point guard Beau Bauer said 
he was told in a team meeting 
on Monday, Aug. 23 that IPFW 
will play Notre Dame "two 
days before Thanksgiving." 

"I'm real excited," Bauer 
said. "This is one of the things 
I always wanted lo do." 

Another source within the 
men's basketball program con- 
firmed the game was on Nov. 
23. However, this contradicts 
Ihe current Mastodon schedule 
posted on the university's web- 
site that slates IPFW will travel 
to Kent Stale on Nov. 23. 
Bauer believes the Mastodons 
will travel to South Bend to 
face the Irish. 

It is not a far-fetched notion 
that IPFW would play Notre 
Dame this upcoming season. 
The Fighting Irish played a 
National Invitation Tournament 
game last March at the 
Memorial Coliseum because of 
a conflict of schedule with their 
women's program. The Irish 
basically rented the facility for 
the night. Bauer did not know 
if this was Notre Dame's way 
of "paying back" IPFW and 
Fort Wayne. 

The Coliseum jammed in 
nearly 12,000 fans to see the 
NIT contest against St. Louis, 
shattering an attendance. 
record. Nearly the entire crowd 
was a rowdy pro-Notre Dame 
bunch creating a wave of yel- 
low, hlue and green. 

Irish head coach Mike Brey 
may have had a heavy influ- 
ence on adding the Mastodons 
to his team's schedule. 

After the NIT game, he said 
Fort Wayne's community sup- 
port, the Coliseum's fresh facil- 
ity, and IPFW's response all 
exceeded his high expectations. 

"I'm staggered by the support 
this community gave us. The 
momentum and the buzz 
around the game. ..was better 
than I thought," Brey said after 
the NIT game.

Cafarelli said the school would
