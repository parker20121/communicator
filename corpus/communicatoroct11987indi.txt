Do men think 
no means yes? 

Dale rape is an act of violence that 
will happen lo one out of every eight 
women. Rape no longer carries the 
stigma ot a slrang« man jumping out 
o[ bushes on a dark night in an unlit 
alley. Hair of all rapes are commit- 
ted by someone the victim is fa- 
miliar with, cither an acquaintance 
or friend. For more Information, see

Senator Pete Groves was the center 

of controversy at the Sept. 23 Student 
Senate meeting. Groves watched the 
Senate staunchly oppose his bill lo 
honor departing Viee-Chaneellor Ed- 
ward Nicholson and pass a resolution 
to consider a lifted walkway between 
campus and Canterbury Green, 

Groves withdrew Bill S76e-J, which 
would have honored the departing 
Nicholson in the face of strong oppo- 
sition In language almost identical lo 
legislation honoring former Dean John 
Ulmer, the bill declared IPFW 
students "forever indebted" to the 
vice-chancellor and would have pre- 
sented Nicholson with a plaque of 
appreciation. 

Groves admitted the bill would be 
"difficult" to pass because of the 
Senate's closeness to former Dean 
Ulmer. who resigned at the request of 
Nicholson last July. Nonetheless, 
Groves hoped the body could set aside 
"personal bias" and recognize 
Nicholson as a man who put "seven 
years into a job." 

It couldn't. Practically every sena- 
tor who spoke opposed the bill but the 
strongest opposition came from Presi- 



dent Kurt Gregory, Gregory, a critic 
of the decision to fire Ulmer, said he 
was "insulted" by the bill's very ex- 
istence, and wondered aloud about 
Groves' motives. Gregory said Nich- 
olson had "never done anything for 
students or our organization" and 
asked Groves, who works in the 
chancellor's office, if he even knew, or 
liked, Nicholson. Groves' affirmafive 
answers caused Gregory to remark. 
"Well, maybe he did something for 



you but he never did anything for us," 
Groves had much better luck with 
his second resolution which will pe- 
tition the administration to consider a 
lighted walkway between Canterbury 
Green and campus. Groves explained 
students living in the apartments had 
to cross a dark field to gel home from 
campus at night. Senator Sandra 
Hadley said the lighted walkway 
would go well with the Fine Arts 
Building which is set to be constructed 



nearby. 

The resolution, which pa^es 11-5, 
met with some opposition. Gregory, 
while playing "the devil's advocate," 
worried that Students' Government 
would be accused of "helping people 
who don'l need to be helped "-athletes 
who already have scholarships and 
school-paid Canterbury Green apart- 
ments, Gregory also asked Groves to 
supply documentation of students' 
complaints.

Kennell heads International Student Organization 



Phil Kennell, director ot inter- 
national services at IPFW, recently 
returned from an ofiicial visit to Mal- 
aysia, Included in this visit were rep- 
resenUtives from eight ot the Big Ten 
universities - Iowa, Illinois, Michigan 
State, Purdue, Ohio SUte. Wisconsin, 
Minnesota, and Indiana, 

Kennell, who represented Indiana 
University, was asked to review a two- 






tphotoby VlnhTrlnhi 

year college in Shah Alam which was 
established by the Midwest Uni- 
versities Consortium for International 
Activities (MUCIA) and the Institu 
Teknologi Mara in 198S. "I happened 
to t&gt;e fortunate enough to be asked by 
Dean Rogers (director of International 
Services at lU Bloomington) to be a 
consultant." 

In 1984, Dean Rogers had an idea to 
set up a program to teach courses in 
Malaysia, since it is very costly to 
send a Malaysian student to college 
out of the country for four years. 

In 19B5, the first classes were 
started in an lU campus setting. In- 
diana was responsible for recruiting 
teachers from the lU system. Other 



teachers from the above schools would 
go for a year or two stay and actually 
teach Malaysians from the established 
lU curriculum set up there. Dr. Mike 
Downs, chairman of political science 
at IPFW, was responsible for es- 
tablishing the curriculum for political 
science at Shah Alam, 

This year was the year for the 1st 
graduating class. Students received a 
two-year associate degree from In- 
diana University's general studies 
program. Then the students were 
placed in the United States at various 
universities. The majors are picked 
for the student by the Malaysian 
government and from test results. The 
government still send the very top 
students to study in England, The next 
group will be recruited to send lo the 
United States, Here at IPFW, there is 
one Malaysian student, Narzal 
Ghazali, who is majoring in business. 

Kennell spent 15 days in Shah Alam. 
located at&gt;oul 12 miles outside of the 
capital Kuala Lumpur, "It is a 
beautiful country. I got to know the 
whole country and system." said 
Kennell. 

While in Malaysia. Kennell was able 
to talk lo educators from independent 
junior colleges set up in Malaysia, He 
was also able to Ulk directly to 450 
students. According to Kennell, "This 
was an outstanding educational ex- 
perience and a great chance lo re- 
cruit I think the whole idea ot re- 
cruiting IS to have direct contact with 
the people you know. It is a good idea 
to know people in the embassies and 
foreign governments so that when you 
write a letter lo them, they know you 
as a person," 

Phil Kennell started his position as 
director of international services on 
Feb, 1 of this year. He has been the 
"unofficial" counselor for 19 years 
when he was the Director of Ad- 
missions. His job is to recruit and 



credit transfer reports. Once the 
students are here, he finds housing for 
them and is a "24 hour counselor," 

The International Students Organi- 
zation (ISO! was revitalized three or 
four years ago It is made up of about 
Bi students on campus, which includes 
Americans. According to Kennell, 
there are over 200 students at IPFW 
who were bom and raised in another 
country, Kennell is trying to recruit 
international students to come here 
for education who have an Fi or Ji 
visa. An Fl visa is a student who has 
no obligation to return to their 
country, however most usually do go 
back A Jl visa is a studenl who is 
sponsored by his govemmenl and is 
obligated to retiuTi, 

ISO is located in Room 214 of Walb 



Memorial Union. It is open lo anyone 
who is interested. Cost of membership 
is $2 for students, and i3 for faculty, 
staff, and the community, 

ISO is planning a poUuck dinner on 
Sunday, Oct, 4, from 5 until 8 p,m, in 
the Walb Ballroom, Everyone is in- 
vited to attend, and bring their favor- 
ite food. 

Other events are planned for differ- 
ent times of the year. There is a 
costume party and a Christmas party. 
Every Friday is a International 
Rendezvous Hour in rooms 224-228. 
from 3-5 p.m. There are also guest ' 
speakers planned for different times 
of the year. 

If there any questions about the 
events, contact Nina TeKert. president 
ot ISO, or Dr. Kennell, 



Independency reviewed 



The Ad Hoc Committee to Review IPFTV's Relationships to Indiana 
University and Purdue University has been elected by the Faculty Senate- 
but the committee may be off to a rocky start. 

David P, Swinehart, an associate professor of supervision, sharply 
criticized the make-up of the new committee. Of Ihe committee's six faculty 
members, five came from the School of Arts and Sciences. Swinehart said 
other schools and divisions should think twice before cooperating, Bui 
committee member and chemistry professor David Onwood said it would 
be unfair to criticize the committee before its first meeting. 

In an interview Friday, Swinehart said he did not mean lo criticize Arts 
and Sciences, but faulted other schools for not taking a more active interest 
in the committee, Foiu: candidates from other schools ran but were all 
defeated, Swinehart said. Swinehart would also have liked to have seen 
seats set aside tor other schools and divisions. The election resolution, 
written by English professor Steve Hollander, required that three members 
come from each university, but made no mention of schools or divisions. 

The other important issue, the smoking policy debate, was postponed lo a 
definite Ume by political science chair, Mike Downs, because Chancellor 
Wallace, whose smoking policy is at the core of the debate, was escorting 
the visiting lU president "Thomas Ehrlich.

Misconceptions block 
understanding of rape 



When is rape not rape? There are 
various answers to this question 
like "Rape isn't rape if the woman 
knows the man," or "It isn't rape if 
the woman leads him on,' or 
dresses too seductively, or invites a 
man to her apartment. .etc. 

All of these can be reasons people 
give for why a woman was Forced 
to have sexual intercourse against 
her will- However, there is no ex- 
cuse for a man "forcing himself" 
on a woman regardless of her past 
sexual history, or the aggressor and 
the victim's past relationship. 

Rape is rape. 

Many people feel that a woman 
, deserved to Be raped or that rapists 
are always strangers. 

Both of these are misconceptions 
yet many of us do not comprehend 
that a rapist could be a man in a 
three piece suit or the boy next 
door. 

Against all these myths there is 
one truth: It does not matter what 
a woman looks like, what she is 
wearing or how long she has known 
the man. 

The term used to describe sexual 
assault between two people who 
already know each other is "date- 
rape," 

Although the effects of date-rape 
are very short for the rapist, the 
victim often suffers for years to 
come. It is doubly devastating on 
the victim tiecause it was not a 



chance attack but rather a brutal 
invasion of both her body and her 
trust. The victim may also not tell 
anyone about the attack for a 
number of reasons: fear of not be- 
ing tjelieved, the rapist may be a 
close friend's husband, father, etc. 
and they may feel guilty or blame 
themselves. 

The courts are beginning to un- 
derstand that date-rape does occur 
and should be prosecuted the same 
as any other rape. However, date- 
rapists realize that few of their 
victims will step forward to prose- 
cute. This means the victim needs 
to learn to defend themselve and 
report to authorities if ever un- 
.fortunate to be raped. 

Rape is a crime that robs the 
victim of self-respect and trust and 
leaves them suspicious of friends 
and strangers alike. Many of these 
victims come out of the experience 
scarred for life. It is an extremely 
rare case when one can return to 
their previous lifestyle. The side- 
effects of such a traumatic experi- 
ence include panic attacks, ex- 
cessive fear of being alone and 
nightmares. 

No one deserves to be raped. 
Regardless of what a woman does, 
no one has the right to decide what 
is done with another person's body. 
Any person who attempts to violate 
someone else's body is committing 
a rape and should be punished as 
such.

Judge your college curriculum critically 



When I arrived at college 
as a freshman some time 
ago, 1 had definite ideas 
about how to use my four 
years of higher education. I 
was resolved to play a little 
(oolball, and 1 wanted to 
major in English in order to 
iKcome sophisticated, land 
a good job and make big 
money. 

But because of my college 
course requirements. 1 
found myself in an in- 
troductory philosophy .class, 
confronted by Plato's Re- 
public and a remarkable 
professor who knew how. lo 
make the lext come aliVe.' 
Before we knew it, my 
classmates and I were en- 
snared by (he power of a 
2,000 year old dialogue. 

In our posture of youthful 
cynicism and arrogance, we 
at first resisted lielieving 
that the question of justice 
should really occupy our 
time. But something im- 



portant happened to us that 
semester as we fought our 
way through the Republic, 
arguing about notions of 
right and wrong Along the 
way, our insides were 
shaken up a bit. Without 
quite knowing it. we had 
committed ourselves to the 
serious enterprise of raising 
and wrestling with great 
questions. And once caught 
up in that enterprise, there 
was no turning back. We 
had met up with ..A great 
text and a great teacher, 
thev had taken us, and we 
^w^r'e theirs. ,;^ 

Every student is entitled 
to that kind of experience at 
college. Good courses 
should shake you up a little, 
expel stale opinions, 
quicken your senses, and 
animate a conscious exam- 
ination of life's enduring 
questions. Unfortunately, a 
growing body of evidence 



indicates (hat (his is simply 
not taking place at enough 
of our colleges. That fact is 
becoming increasingly 
obvious. 

Proof of this is the extra- 
ordinary reception given to 
University of Chicago Pro- 
fessor Allan Bloom's new 
book, The Closing of the 
American Mind, 

Our universities, Profes- 
sor Bloom asserts, are too 
often hostile to serious 
thought; no longer are they 
places where transmission, 
criticism and renewal of 
intellectual traditions are 
assured, "The University 
now offers no distinctive 
visage to the young per- 
son," Bloom asserts, nor a 
set of competing visions of 
what an educated human 
being is. 

If Professor Bloom is 
correct — and there is 



every reason to believe that 
he is — then something has 
gone terribly wrong on 
many American campuses. 
As a student, you can do 
something akwut this The 
first thing you can do is get 
a copy of Allan Bloom's 
l&gt;ook, and read it. Think 
about what he has to say. 
Ask yourself some hard 
questions about your college 
or university. And ask those 
same hard questions of your 
professors, faculty, and 
administrators 

If you're not satisfied, 
with the answers you gel — 
if you're not satisfied with 
the education your school is 
providing — resolve to get a 
good education anyway 
Fortunately, at leas( a few 
good allies can be found on 
almost evei7 campus: good 
teachers, serious friends 
and good books. In selecting 
courses, don't be afraid in- 



tellectually to bite off more 
than you can chew. Seek out 
the t)est teachers, those who 
can stretch the limits of 
your knowledge and bring 
life to the subject at hand. 
Take advantage of those 
teachers in class after 
class. 

In the end. regeneration 



of 



rsitie 



will 



from within. Only 
those within the academy, 
can rescue the academy,,. 
Students can play a part..^ 
Students can demand ttiat^ 
colleges live up to the pTo^f. 
mises 'In their glossy' cai-I 
alogues This wilt benefit. 
you. and it will be a service 
to those who follow in your 
path. 

So read Bloom, think hard 
— but also have fun this 
year. (This article was

Squeeze reforms with founding members 
'^^'Babylon and On'' missing depth of original sound 



Sque«e 

"Babylon and On" 
A &amp; M Records 

■Well, nol a whole lol go- 
ing on (his week; aclually, 
arather dull period in Ihe 
music induslry. To com- 
plcle the boredom, the new 
release from Squeeze is 
here. 

REVIEW 



Yes, you heard right thai 
Ihis liand had broken up. 
but It seems fashionable, or 
rather protilable. for suc- 
cessful bands from Ihe past 
lo reform and churn out a 
new album. Unfortunately, 
the product usually has no 
substance to it (i.e. Pink 
Floyd, Aerosmith, Lynyrd 
Skynyrd), Ihe exceptions 
being Yes and Deep Purple. 

Enter Squeeze, a band 
who rode in on the crest of 
the sy nth-pop British in- 
vasion of the early eighties. 



although their sound wasn't 
synth. After singer Paul 
Carrack left lo try a solo 
career (and is now with 
Mike and the Mechanics), 
guitarist Glenn Tilbrook 
took over vocals, and the 
band had one of their big- 
gest American hits, "Black 
Coffee in Bed," 

In 1985. the band split up 
for lack of direction and the 
various members looked for 
solo careers. Tilbrook did 
an album with keyboardist 
Chris Difford. which went 



nowhere, and the other 
members had projects of 
their own which are 
scarcely worth mentioning. 

Now, in 1987. the band has 
reformed with all the origi- 
nal members to produce 
"Babylon and On." One 
might wish that they would 
have stayed separated; at 
least (hat way we could 
have retained some good 
memories of what was. 

Now we have what is a 
syrupy, mellow slice of 
boredom that goes abso- 



lutely nowhere. One very 
fortunate fact about this 
album is that Tilbrook's 
vocals sound exactly, al- 
most uncannily like Boy 
George's, The music even 
sounds like Culture Club, 

Basically, every song 
sounds the same If you had 
to pick one song to repre- 
sent this album, the first 
song on side one, "Hour- 
glass," is probably the best, 
although (he rest aren't 
much different. You can 
hear (he distinct sound of 
Squeeze here, yel it is

Volley dons' streak ends 



BY MIKE LINVILLE 
SporU Editor 

A wise man once said thai 
all good things musl come 
[0 an end and so it was for 
Ihe IPFW women's vol- 
leyball team on a recent 
road trip to Bomeovillc, Il- 
linois, on Friday. Sep!. 25. 

The host school, Lewis 
University, downed the 
Dons three games to two 
and ended the team's un- 
defeated season at seven 
games and snapped a 15- 
match winning streak that 
extended over the past two 



match, as i 
the games went back and 
forth. Lewis captured the 
opener by a 15-11 score but 
IPFW came back to win the 
second game, 15-12. The 
Flyers look game three by 
a 15-5 score followed by a 
15-9 win by the Volleydons 
The rubber match went to 
the Flyers 15-12. 

The Mastodons should not 
feel loo bad about their loss 
to Lewis as the Flyers have 
developed a habit lately of 
beating top twenty teams.

A trip to Indianapolis Sat- 
urday was a bit more fruit- 
ful as the Mastodons came 
home with a 2-0 win over 
Ihe University of 

Indianapolis, 

Saturday, against the 
Greyhounds, the IPFW 
team did something it had 
never done before this sea- 
son — score more than one 
goal in a game. Junior 
forward Jeff Doherty tallied 
for the Dons at the 15:38 
mark of the first half, off an 
assist by sophomore mid- 
fielder Jerry Jenkins 
Doherty had a hand in the 



Dons' second goal as he as- 
sisted Dave Yates, who 
scored at the 32: 18 mark, 

"The first half was the 
best we have played all 
year," said Coach Bronn 
Ptieffer. "We passed the 
ball very well." 

"Indianapolis had some 
good skill players but we 
played better as a team." 
said Pfeiffer, 

"The two guys (Doherty 
and Yates) we were count- 
ing on to do our scoring got 
our goals," added Pfeiffer. 

"We played well on de- 



fen; 



utdo^ 



their 



(Indianapolis University) 
attack and didn't give them 
anything," Pfeiffer said. 

The strong defense 
showed up in the fact that 
goalie Kevin Mann only had 
five saves because the 
Greyhounds were usually 
not in a position to shoot on 
goal, 

"We didn't play as well in 



the second half, we didn't 
control the game like in the 
first half." said Pfeiffer, 

Sophomore Mark 
Zumbraegel sot out the 
University of Indianapolis 
game due to an injury suf- 
fered during the game 
against Lewis. Freshman 
Rico Ignace stepped in and 
played a strong game. 

"Rico played sweeper and 
did very well in a tough 
situation for a freshman," 
said Pfeiffer 

Against Lewis, the Dons 
were on the other end of the 
stick as the Flyers con- 
trolled play and spent most 
of the afternoon in iPFW's 
end of the field. Lewis had 
six shots on goal to the 
Dons' one in the first half. 
Lewis also attempted three 
corner kicks. 

For the game, Lewis had 
14 shots on goal and foiu* 
cornerkicks. IPFW added 
two more shots on goal in 



the second half to total 
three for the game. The 
Dons attempted no comer 
kicks, Kevin Mann recorded 
13 saves for IPFW 

Steve Glennon scored the 
Flyers' first period goal al 
the 7:10 mark, Sam) 
Boudakk tallied both of Ihe 
Flyers' second half goals, 

"Lewis played great, they 
were stronger and had bet- 
ter skills and speed," said 
Pfeiffer, 

At the time of this writing 
the Mastodons' overall re- 
cord is 2-3-1, and they are 1- 
3 in the Great Lakes Valley 
Conlerence,
