Couch potatoes — 

Attending class now possible 



BV KIM TETER 
Staff Reporter 

For those couch potatoes who do 
their homework in front of the tele- 
vision, take heed; startmg in January, 
doing homework in front of the 
television may be necessary. . 

"Fundamentals of Economics" is 
the first teleclass to be offered by 
IPFW for Fort Wayne residents who 
subscribe to Comcast Cable and for 
those students who spend a lot of their 
time in front of the telev.sion. 

The cost of the cour^ is S157.S0. 
plus texttxKik and telecourse study 
guide. "Fundamentals of Economics" 
is a three-hour credit course which 
will be telecast on cable channel 23 
during the spring semester of 1988 via 
a nationally acclaimed telecourse. The 
Annentierg Series. 

John Manzer. director of the Center 
for Economic Education and associate 
professor of economics m the School of 
Business and Management Sciences, 
commented on why IPFW is offering a 
teleclass: "For an urban university, 
we haven't even l&gt;egun to use the fa- 
cilities available to us. We need 
something to reach those places we 
normally cannot reach and go more 
out lo the students" 

The TV portion of the class will 
consist of 28 tapes from the Annenberg 
Series, shown on Mondays from 5 to 6 
p.m.. Wednesday from 10 to 11 a.m., 
and Thursday 8 lo 9 p.m. Every two 
weeks l}eginmng Saturday, Jan. 23, 
Manzer will conduct a UO minute re- 
view session on Saturdays 
campus 

Each teleclass could be videotaped 
and then replayed and reviewed many 
times to aid the retention of the 
material. The course starts with a re- 
quired orientation session on campus 
Tuesday, Jan, 12, 

Last year Purdue University, West 
Lafayette, released the series And in 
order for IPFW to attain the teleclass, 
it had to go through many steps First 
it had to be approved by Chancellor 
Wallace and be budgeted. Then it had 
to go through the registrar's office and 
the Economics office, and promotional 
strategy had to be developed on how 
the information of the teleclass would 
reach the others in outlying areas. 

Manzer said even Fort Wayne 
Community Schools has been con- 



tacted lo use the Annenberg Series as 
perhaps a course for a seniors' Honors 
Program. "The logistics were a little 
more than I thought they would be." 
Manzer commented. 

The course should be a boon to cur- 
rent or prospective college students 
whose time is limited and would have 
problems allending classes on cam- 
pus. Manzer stated, "This isn't going 
to be like watching Bugs Bunny car- 
toons on Saturday mornings. The stu- 



dents can't expect lo just sit there and 
then take the lest; it's going lo lake a 
combination of reading the chapters, 
watching the tapes, and complcling 
the problems at the end of the chap- 
ters. , 

"It's not a 'talking heads' scries. 
The class uses a high quality of jour- 
nalistic approach lo examine 
economic issues," Manzer exclaimed. 

More teleclasses are t)eing planned 



at Indiana University, Bloommgton, 
for an accounting class and a business 
law class, Manzer said IPFW could 
possibly expect these teleclasses 
within the next Iwo years. 

Those interested in IPFW'a first 
teleclass, "Fundamentals of Eco- 
nomies," should attend the orientation 
session at 6:30 p.m., Tuesday, Jan, 12 
in Walb Memorial Union, room 224, or 
by calling John Manzer in the IPFW 
business department.

New chairman named to board 



BV KIM TETER 
Staff Reporter 

Back in 19B2, last year's Vice 
Chancellor Ed Nicholson started a 
program from an idea he discovered 
while in Dayton, The idea was lo bring 
the younger people into learning about 
community endeavors such as art, 
politics, and education, just to name a 
few. 

The Leadership of Fort Wayne pro- 
gram is a community-wide effort with 
the goal to identify, motivate, and de- 
velop potential leaders Those thirty 
students that are selected lo be a part 
of the leadership program spend every 



fourth Tuesday of the month for a 
year listening and learning about all 
aspects ol the community. 

■The program consists of eight full- 
day seminars, one three-day weekend 
retreat, and an internship. Each 
seminar is addressed by a guest 
speaker. 

This year, attorney Walter Helmke 
was elected as chairman of the Lead- 
ership of Fort Wayne advisory board. 
Helmke replaced Nicholson, who has 
been chairman since the program first 
started. Helmke has served on the 
board from the beginning, when 
Nicholson came lo him and asked him 



Reorganization nearing final stage 



With the naming of several aca- 
demic units as schools headed by 

deans, re-organization at IPFW is now 
virtually complete. 

The move was announced at the 
Friday. Sept. 25, meeting of directors 
of Ihe Indian a- Purdue at Fort Wayne 
Foundation, Chancellor Thomas 
Wallace praised the move in an 
interview last Thursday. 

Wallace believes this new desig- 
nation will not only reflect common 
usage at other universities, but will 
increase the quality of the candidates 
for dean-level positions 

"We've held off the search for two 
deans t«cause it would improve the 
quality of candidates. It gives the 
status to this campus that this campus 
deserves. IPFW deserves to be treated 
like a university, " said Wallace. 

The largest of the new schools is the 
School of Arts and Sciences, Headed 
by Acting Dean Julius Smulkslys, the 
school includes the departments of 
audiology and speech sciences, bio- 
logical sciences, chemistry, com- 
munication, computer science, earth 
and space sciences. English and lin- 
guistics, history, mathematical 
sciences, modern foreign languages, 
philosophy, physics, political science, 
psychological sciences and sociology. 

The School of Business and 
Management Sciences is headed by 
Dean George Bullion, and includes the 
departments of business and eco- 
nomics, consumer and family sciences 
and supervision. 

The School of Engineering and 
Technology includes the departments 



of civil and architectural engineering 
and computer technology, electrical 
engineering technology, engineering 
and manufacturing technology. Dean 
Warren Worthley will begin a three 
year leave of al&gt;sence in January. 

The School of Fine and Performing 
Arts includes the departments of fine 
arts, music and theater, with James 
D Alor the acting dean 

Those units which are pari of state- 
wide Indiana University programs will 
remain divisions, headed by directors. 
These include the Division of Edu- 



cation, headed by Marjorie Souers. 
Ihe Division of Health Sciences, 
headed by Acting Director Peter T 
Zonakis, which includes the Division 
of Dental Auxiliary Education and the 
departments of health professions. 
mental health technology, and 
nursing. 

Finally, there are the Division of 
Public and Environmental Affairs, 
headed by Mark Rosenlraub, and the 
lU School of Medicine, Fort Wayne 
Center for Medical Education, headed 
by Director Barlh Ragatz, 




Bayh visited IPFW 

Former Indiana Senator Birch Bayh spoke at IPFW on Oct. 29. Mr. Bayh's 
lecture was a part of the IPFW Town and Gown series, (photo by Dorin 
Cindea) 



This year, the advisory board met 
and elected Helmke as chairman. 
Helmke commented. "I told the board 
I'd do it for a while; after all. every- 
one has lo do a job. I enjoy seeing the 
accomplishments of Ihe students who 
can bring new ideas." 

As chairman, Helmke appoints the 
committees who will oversee the pro- 
gram. He also presides over all the 
advisory board meetings. However, 
Helmke's job is a volunteer job. The 
only person paid is Coleen Spencer, 

Spencer is the executive director of 
the Leadership of Fort Wayne. Her 
office is located on campus at IPFW, 
in the administration offices in 
Kettler. 

Leadership of Fort Wayne is co- 
sponsored bv the Chamber of Com- 
merce and IPFW. The reason the of- 
fice is located at IPFW is because of 
the need of a place lo keep Tiles. Also. 
IPFW usually has a representative 
who has tieen selected for the 
program. 

Helmke commented, "11 is a good 
program and I think it's worked out 
well" 

Currently, there are 33 members 
(sponsors? of the advisory board but 
they are always looking for new spon- 
sors to develop "bright young talent" 
who can serve on boards of the vari- 
ous community affairs. Representing 
IPFW on the board is Chancellor Tom 
Wallace. 

The fee is $900. which is usually paid 
by a sponsor. Helmke commented 
there are usually two to three times as 
many apphcations than they can use. 
Only thirty people are selected for the 
leadership training course by a com- 
mittee. The three requirements for 
joining the program are that one must 
be a college graduate, have a job in 
Fort Wayne, and have the desire lo be 
in a leadership position. There are 
scholarships available. 

Helmke's goal as chairman is to 
place everyone on boards and/or 
commissions and to make the pro- 
grams interesting Helmke stated. 
"Hopefully Ihe students will l&gt;ecome 
indoctrinated to become a part of a 
board so they can contribute."

cation form for the sixth class of

Veterans deserve more 
than one day per year 



Slowly the flag raises to the 
sounds of "Taps," a team of 
middle-aged men in uniform gather 
around the flagpole; speeches are 
delivered. Phrases like "our 
country," "fought for freedom." 
and "loyalty and courage" spill 
like water. 

Veteran's Day, A day when the 
entire country honors every man 
who fought for America in a war 

What does the day really mean'' 
Everyone understands thai soldiers 
are veterans. But what about all 
the hidden veterans'' Veterans who 
never saw a battlefield, never car- 
ried a gun or followed an order 

Is it any consolation to deceased 
veterans mothers and fathers thai 
their sons were sacrificed to 
"further democracy''" What about 
the wives who waited in vain for 
husbands that were lying dead in 
some foreign land? Surely I hey 
deserve some sort of support and 
comfort; sitting by a mailbox 

ftraying for a letter from their 
oved ones, yet fearful of a gov- 
ernment representative delivering 
the dreaded words, "I'm sorry but 
your husband was killed." 
Are these people veterans also'' 



Or does it really matter? Has Vet- 
eran's Day become a meaningless 
holiday for the masses? Are the 
only ones who rememt)er Veteran's 
Day those who served? 

Apparently this is the case. Many 
people feel that Veteran's Day is an 
inconvenience because the banks 
and post offices are closed. Others 
simply relax on their day off from 
work or school while not giving the 
veterans a second thought 

The only way many people know 
it is Veteran's Day is when they 
happen to catch the forty-five sec- 
ond spot on the nightly news. 

This holiday certainly deserves 
more respect and attention than 
this. The thousands who died in 
wars and the thousands more who 
lost loved ones.,, certainly they 
deserve more than a forty-five 
second news brief. 

They deserve, as Veterans, not to 
spend the day in a sweaty, smelly 
factory, Or not to spend the day 
bent over a desk at work. They 
deserve the respectability of a day 
off in their honor 

They deserve a lifetime of 
compassion 



—Letter to the Editor — 



Tolhe Editor; 

Although I doubl thai 
writing lellera replying to 
replies to letters lo Ihc edi- 
lor is generally a valuable 
use of one's lime, I shall 
make on exception regartt- 
ing Fitness Coordinator 
Judy Trikonra' Icller crili- 
clzing The Communicator 
concerning Troy Leyse's 
letter thai complained (hat 
there arc loo (ew dumbbells 
in the IPFW weigh! room, 

Trilfones claimed to be 
"very disappointed to see 
this letter published without 
consulting me first" and 
recommended "a little 
more professionalism in 
researching for accurate 

pnnling " 

NO. cursed with a IcUsh 
forffrcisc expression (as is 
alsDTevcaled by her posted 



list of weighl-room slric- 
lures, which includes such 
gems as "'radios must be 
kept at a moderate volume 
and slalion" and "weight 
belts permitted in tree 
weighl area only," Trigones 
seems unaware thai her 
suggestion is ambiguous 
between at least these in- 
terpreiations , il i It was OK 
to publish Leyse's letter, 
bul only afler leUing me 
hnow about il in advance. 
(2) II was OK to publish 
Le&gt;-se's letter, but only if 
you had printed a rejoinder 
in the same issue. i3) You 
should have consulted me, 
and then printed the letter 
only wiUi my permission. 

II seems to me that 
neither il) nor 12) nor i3i is 
a good idea As TY],&gt;: .. 
Communicator pointed out. 
newspapers should not get 



into Ihe business of censor- 
ing letters lo the editor, 
which are, after all. ex- 
pressions of the opinions ot 
readers, not the paper. 

This entails thai ill. (2i, 
and (3) are unfounded, 
since The Communicator . 
had no obligation lo inform 
Trikones aboul Ihe leller. 
Moreover, inasmuch as a 
letter lo The Communicator 
is )usl that, a tetter directed 
lo The Communicator and 
not Trikones. in the interest 
of protecting L*yse's right 




Comm 



cy . 



The 



ligation not to inform 
Trikones, at least not with- 
out L*yse's consent. (For 
instance, as I compose this 
letter 1 believe that it would 
be a violation afpiy righb" 
if The Communicator were 
lo discuss ils eonlenis with 



some third party.) 

The only exception 1 can 
imagine would be if Leyse's 
leUerwere libelous, that is, 
both malicious and untrue. 
In fact, Leyse's letter was 
neither Jt was not mali- 
cious , since it simply cited 
□ problem and expressed a 
wish for a solution, without 
condemning anyone 
(indeed, no persons were 
mentioned by name&gt;. ll'was 
not untrue , since the condi- 
tion Leyse cited existed at 
the lime he wrote (he 
leller: until two weeks ago 
there was only one sel of 
dumbbells 

So o( what was L*yse 
culpable? Of not going 1q- 
Trikones persoiially to Ka've' 



assurances of future splen- 
dors? Perhaps. Thai is how 
I have expressed my ob- 
jections, lo no avail, I might 
add. 

Bul I surmise, on Ihe' 
basis not only of that leller 
bul due lo her treatment of 
other cnlics and the hapless 
students who work under 
her, thai the real trans- 
gression according to 
Trikones was that Leyse 
dared lo dissent at all. to be 
critical of Ihe existing silu- 
alion and those in authority. 



As 1 



in 1987 ' 



controllers must discourage 
negative, rebellious 
Jhinkin^ -TTyr^p. ^ 

'"Ya^'it ihis'SWRjIcRire 
'inced_jliQUgh, 



Ihal Trikones should have 
wrillen a leller informing 
all that the situation to 
which L,eyse objected is now 
rectified, without advocat- 
ing quasi-censorship. Al- 
though this may look like a 
trivial matter, il reveals, I 
think. Ihal IPFW has yet 
one more (admittedly low- 
level) administrator whose 
tunnel-visioned boosterism 
leaves no room for sen- 
sitivity lo the value ot in- 
dividual rights, dissent, or 
anything that interferes 
with the crass pursuit of 
bollom-line objectives. This, 
I fear, is the wave of the 
present and the future.

member of the Dons' squad. 
However, he could not go 
out for the pro team at that 
time because it would have 
affected his scholarship 
eligibility. 

The indoor game is very

Bronn Pfeiffer 



IPFW soccer coach. 
Bronn Pfeiffer, is getting 
such a chance as a member 
of the Fort Wayne Flames 
indoor soccer team 

Pfeiffer. who played four 
years for the Mastodon 
soccer squad and has just 
finished his initial season as 
head coach at IPFW, is a 
reserve member of the 
Flames' team this season 

The Flames are in their 
second year of existence 
"and are an affiliate of the 
American Indoor Soccer 
Association. The team fin- 
ished near the bottom of the 
league standings last sea- 



"Trying to compare indoor 
soccer to outdoor is like 
trying to compare street 
hockey to ice hockey; it is 
totally different," said 
Pfeiffer. 

"I had played soccer in- 
doors at the Tecumwah 
Recreational Center and 
inside a gym before but this 
is different. It takes awhile 
to get used to the boards, 
the turf and how quick the 
pace of the inside game is, 
plus the fans are right on 
lop of you " 

Pfeiffer claims the indoor 
game is closer to the game 
of hockey than outdoor 
soccer. The field is the 
same size as the hockey 
rink it Is set-up on at the 
Coliseum. Two forwards, 
two detensemen, a mid- 
fielder and a goalkeeper 
make up (he starling unit 
for an indoor soccer team. 

The turf, similar to the 
astro-turf used in many 
football stadiums, is put 
down right over the Coli- 
seum ice The walls are in- 
bounds and shots on goal 
can be ricocheted off the 
walls around the field like 
shots in a game of pool. 



Because the field is 
smaller than a regulation 
soccer field, "everything is 

magnified," said Pfeiffer 
"The game is a lot quicker. 
Time and space is very 
important because both are 
cut down. " 

"11 is a lot like ice hockey 
with its quick pace and 
power plays. A team is al- 
lowed six fouls per quarter 
and after the sixth is com- 
mitted a team must play a 
man short for two minutes. 
There are regular penalties 
for violent play Sub- 
stitutions are made on the 
fly and the only time the 
action stops is for corner 
kicks. Its a demanding 
pace and the players are on 
the field for only about two 
minutes at a time." 

Pfeiffer took part in two 
of the Flames exhibition 
games against the Canton 
Invaders Fort Wayne 
dropped both contests, the 
first in double overtime. 4-3, 
and the second, 3-2, at the 
Coliseum. Canton is the 
league's defending 
champion. 

■'The game against 
Canton I played backfield 
or defender and I was still 
getting used to passing the 
ball on an artificial surface; 
you have to hit the ball a lot 
harder," said Pfeiffer 

Pfeiffer missed one of the 
Dons' games and a part of 
another to participate in the 
two exhibition games, but 
he believes he can continue 
to coach the IPFW squad 
and be a member of the 
Flames in the future It 
should not be a major oti- 
staclc, as the Mastodon 
season is winding down as 
the Flames season starts 
up. The main problem is the 
overlap of Flames' exhibi-

"In soccer most, of the 
coaching is done during 
practice. Once a game be- 
gins, not a whole lot of 
coaching is done Plus i 
have a very reliable assist- 
ant in Ron Harkenrider," 
Pfeiffer explained. 



Even though he was listed 
as a reserve member of the 
team. Pfeiffer got a starling 
nod in the Flames' season 
opener against the Mil- 
waukee Waves. Friday. 
Nov 6, The Flames dropped 
the game 5-2. but Pfeiffer 
recorded an assist on one of 
Fort Wayne's goals 



How does Pfeiffer feel 
atwul playing professional 
indoor soccer? "I'm thrilled 
lo he playing with the 
Flames, I've gotten n lot of 
support from my parents, 
friends and members of the 
IPFW soccer team. I just 
hope I can slay injury free 
and perform at my best." 



St. Joseph eliminates IPFW 



BY MIKE LINVILLE 
Sports Editor 

IPFW exited the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference 
tournament via a 2-0 loss to 
the St. Joseph's College 
Pumas, Wednesday. Nov. 4. 
at Rensselaer. 

It was the same old bug- 
aboo that has plagued the 
Dons all season thai led lo 
their defeat to St. Joe: lack 
of offense. 

"We just couldn't put the 
ball in the net but that typi- 
fies our season," said Coach 
Bronn Pfeiffer. 

"St Joe played smart 
soccer- They got a first-half 
goal: we pushed it up in the 
second half trying for the 
tying goal but with about a 
minute and a half to go St. 
Joe scored their second 
goal." 

The Mastodons totaled six 



shots on goal lo the Pumas' 
nine. Neither team ni- 
lompted a corner kick, 
Kevin Mann recorded four 
saves al goal keeper for the 
Dons Both St. Joe goals 
were scored hy H Ahrens 

IPF'W finishes the season 
with a record of 3-12-1 and a 
GLVC record of one and 

Looking back, Pfeiffer 
said, "The season was a 
failure hut I'm happy with a 
few of the players; Kevin 
Mann, Mark Coffee, and 
Rico Ignace, a freshman 
who played well. Coffee 
kept the team close by 
playing good defense and 
Mann was good in goal. 
Also, our other goalkeepers 
had to play positions they 
had never played before 
and did well." 

Lookmg ahead to the 13AB 
season. Pfeiffer outlined 



what he IwUeves lo be ihc 
needs of Ihe Dons' soccer 
squad. "We definitely need 
to improve. We can't get 
any worse unless we go 0- 
16. I have to recruit a 
complete new team. We had 
some players quit on us and 
we were hurl by players 
who weren't committed to 
Ihc team, or "part time 
players' as wc called them, 
You can't have Ihal on this 
level of play," 

One of the players 
Pfeiffer is looking at as a 
possible recruit is Mike 
Anhcuser of Homcslcad 
High School, "He is a very 
good player, probably the 
best in Fort Wayne." 

Pfeiffer plans to recruit 
players from around the 
area and possibly out of 
state, along with players 
from Fort Wayne

Sling 

"...Nothing Like the Sun" 

A&amp;M Rcrords 

There comes a time when 
everyone must finally grow 
up and shake oii the trap-' 
pings of their younger days. 



REVIEW 

In the music industry. 
. this IS (he reason some 
popsters vanish from the 



iTlS 

youthful frivolity is gone, 
and they are unable 
to advance themselves to 
J higher, more in- 
telligent musical level. Rick 
Springfield, Andy Gibb and 
Adam AnI are just a few 
examples of artists thai 
have twen locked away in 
the "where are they now'" 
file. 

The last eight years have 
been the evolution of Sling, 
from first being a teen 
popsiar in the early days of 
The Police to a sort of tor- 
tured genius in the later 



days of that band No' 
Ihe band has almost defi- 
nitely split-up for good, and 
Stuart Copeland won't even 
give Sting the lime of day. 
we see Sting's further evo- 
lution into one of Ihc most 
important musicians to over 
hit the industry. 

■■...Nothing Like the Sun" 
off the bat is not very 
commercially viable. One 
or two songs could easily 
get airplay, but on the 
whole, the album is hardly 
heard on the radio at all. 
The album goes away from 



rock and 

Sting's passion: jazz. 

It is a rocked-up jazz, but 
nothing the masses of mind- 
eroded Huey Lewis/ 
Whilesnake children are 
ready for. II is a double 
album, another sign of non- 
commercial markcling. 
Each side contains three 
songs, most way over Con- 
temporary Hit Radio 
format lime length. 

Side one starts off with 
"The Lazarus Heart." a 
jazzy rocker that introduces

Dirty Dancing" breaks away 
from romance-and-dance films 



I'll have lo admit that I 
was surprised at how much 
I liked "Dirty Dancing " 

REVIEW 

For the first fifteen min- 
utes or so, I wondered why 
I was there and what this 
film was or wasn't trying to 
do. But then it picked up. 
Things started lo happen. 
The plot turned out (o bo 
fairly typical of a dance 
movie— girl meets boy. boy 
leaches girl lo dance, they 
fall in love— but "Dirty 
Dancing" told the story 
convincingly and with 
feeling. 

The setting- a family re- 
treat, run by Jack Weston 
("The Four Seasons"), 
where they teach the guests 
lo rhumba. The time: the 



pre-Beatles, late 50's, when 
"close" dancing was taboo 
The girl. Baby, visits (he 
dance instructor's dance 
hall and finds Ihem do- 
ing a strange and wonderful 
kind of dancing— "dirty" 
dancing. 

Jennifer Grey ("Ferris 
Bueller's Day Off"! gives a 
wonderful performance as 
but the formula works 
here— no! like in "Terms of 
Endearment," where the 
formula overshadows the 
plot— and il makes for a 
good evening out. 

All in all, (he film was 
worth (he S4,75 I paid and 1

One thing bugged me 
though: IS Ihe pop song. 



and South parts land 11"). 
"Dancing" has all the 
elements of a good family 
film, romance, humor, 
family conflict and resolu- 
tion, and a PG-13 rating. 
However, "Dancing" also 
had what it takes to be a 
lake-your-dale film without 
showing explicil sex. 



In reality, -'Dirty Danc- 
ing" was a formula film,

■Scapin." 
This play is different 

'rom PIT'S other produc- 
Ihis year. 11 is not a 
drama and it is not de- 
pressing. It is a light 
hearted comedy directed by 
Joe) Murray. This play also 
uses a great deal of audi- 
ence participation: at times 
the characters may actually 
have some one-on-one dis- 
course with the audience- 

"Scapino" also has mu- 
sic According lo Murray, 



What:

Where:

$5 adults, $3 
for students 



the musical numtwrs can 
l&gt;est be described as mu- 
sical non-sequilors. Al 
times the music section 
may break into melody (or 
no reason whatsoever. In- 
cluded in the music section 
is an accordion player, 
Susan Golembiewski, who 
has won awards tor her 
music The accordions add 
a dance hall atmosphere to 
the production 

Aside from the music, the 
play has an extremely col- 
orful set The costumes arc 
also colorful and eccentric, 
slates Murray. 

The characters them- 
selves play around Scapino, 
portrayed by Jim Yarnelle. 
as he leads the others into 
trouble and out of it again. 
The characters themselves 
have different dialects and 
styles. There is a valley 
girl, a frenchman and a 
Marilyn Monroe-type, to 
name a few. Other charac- 
ters in the production are 
Ottavio, portrayed by Blake 
Slorie, who has also played 
in PIT productions 
"Luther" and "She Stoops 
lo Conquer." Scott Diaz, 
who has also been in 
■■Luther," ■■West Side 
Story" and "Anne Frank." 
portrays Carlo. Giacinia is 
portrayed by Christine 
Tobacotf, who has been In 
"The Women." 

The part of Scapino is a 



tough part, involving a lot 
of exercise around the stage 
and over the platforms 

This will be the last pro- 
duction of the season. The 
next production will be 
■■Aluminum Paradise, ■' 
which is written by Murray 
and will be directed by 
Murray. This play is about 
a family (hat lives in a 
trailer park. Auditions for 
"Aluminum Paradise" will 
be Monday, Nov. 30, in the 
PIT auditorium at 7 p.m. 
Murray twiieves he will 



need eight men and four 
women but the figures may 
change 

"Scapino" is funny and 
silly ■'Check your brain at 
the door." staled Murray, 
The play is a fantastical 
farce, not to be taken 
sefiously. 

Tickets for ■'Scapino" are 
J5, S3 for students with their 
student ID. card. It will 
open Friday, Nov. 13, and 
complete a three-week run.
