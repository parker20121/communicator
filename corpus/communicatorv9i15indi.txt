turn your books 

into Christmas presents 

It's easy - when you finish with your books, you trade 
them in for cash! Then go out and blow it on your friends 
and family. 



Whether you end up one fat Santa or a little short depends 
on how many books you've got to sell, what condition 
they're in, and whether or not there's a need for them 
nationwide. 

Whatever you want to use the money for it will sure beat 
just letting them lie around collecting dust. So bring your 
books over to the professional bookbuyers at the bookstore 
now, while your book is worth the most it will ever be. 



Wait too long and the chances are you may end up 
playing Scrooge!

db: 



Model 3BX $650 00 

Other DBX Models Starting at $21 9" 



Do you know your records are missing 
half their dynamics? 



The limitations o( the recording process require 
record arid tape manufacturers to sacrifice nearly 
half the dynamic content of live music. Crescendos 
and loudness variations containing vital musical 
information must be reduced in scale, compromising 
the presence and excitement of the original 
performance. 

These compromises result in the loss of the sharp 
attacks of percussion, a softening of the characteristic 
overtones that differentiate instruments, and a loss 
of definition in loud passages when many instruments 
are playing together. 



It is the contrast between loud and quiet sounds which 
contributes vitality to music, builds interest and 
suspense, and stirs excitement in the listener. A few 
moments of listening to a contemporary record or tape 
on a good playback system is all you need to realize 
that much of what we enjoy in live music is simply not 
available from commercial records and tapes. The 
complex technical reasons for this deficiency are 
explained in detail in other dbx publications available 
on request. 



What is the 3BX? 



Where traditional single band 
expanders offered a moderate 
increase in dynamics, the 3BX 
separates the frequency spectrum 
into three separate bands and 
expands each band individually to 
provide significantly more dynamic 
enhancement than can be artfully 
achieved by a single band system. 
The linear decibel 3BX expands all 
the musical information on your 
recordings, without sacrificing vital 
harmonic content as do competitive 
expanders' The 3BX is simple to 
operate, requiring no technical 
knowledge. 



It's the closest thing 
to being there 

The 3BX achieves equally dramatic 
audible results whether used with 
moderately priced component based 
music systems or with the most 
extensive audiophile systems. It 
gives your record and tape collection 
a new dimension and adds dramati- 
cally to the realism of FM broadcasts 
which makes home listening an 
exciting new experience. 

Ask the dbxpert at your demonstrat- 
ing dbx dealer for the demonstration 
you won't forget. It must be heard 
to be believed. 



Expansion is the cure 
for missing dynamics 

An expander is a complex electronic 
system which makes quiet sounds 
quieter and loud sounds louder to 
restore the dynamics sacrificed in the 
recording process. Previously 
available expanders have been able 
to restore missing dynamics to only 
a limited degree without introducing 
undesirable side effects such as 
"pumping" and "breathing."

New technology comes 
to expanders 

With the coming of the seventies 
dbx developed proprietary (paten 
circuit techniques to make succe: 
expanders which restore a substa 
portion of missing musical dynan 
gracefully. As dramatic as these 
advances were, there was a need 
further improvement in dynamic 
range enhancement to more corr 
pletely recreate the live listening 
experience.
