HOMELAND SECURITY I 




Fort Wayne area at risk? 

"They don't know what Fort Wayne, Indiana is and it wouldn't help them." 
-BernieBeier, 
Director of Fort Wayne's Office of Homeland Security 



By Nick West 



Fort Wayne and the surrounding area is home to 
several military defense industry branches that have 
capabilities to directly support current United States 
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. These industries 
supply the military with 
technologies.

because of the vast miles of interstate, highway and 
railway systems. In fact, over 13,000 miles of major 
transportation grace the lioosier state map, including 
several throughout the Summit City. The agriculture 
industry - mainly com and soybean - provides nearly 
10 percent of the nation's entire loud supply. 

In theory, attack i ng Fort Wayne companies that help 



provide lechnologies i&lt;&gt; ihe nalinrv in the Middle East 
with the goal of crippling them would seem plausible 
for terrorists who wish to eliminate those very U.S. 
military forces that occupy their homelands, right? 
And all of Indiana's miles of highways should provide 
adequate routes to terrorists as they seek resources 
for attacks in mass-populated fines like Chicago and 
Detroit, right? And what about poisoning die lofty

that an attack by international terrorists isn't likely in 
Fort Wayne. 

"In the case of al-Qaeda, if their goal is to reduce 
or remove the American presence on the Arabian 
Peninsula -which it is- would an at lack in Fort Wayne

YLNI also hopes to become a source for information 
on issues affecting the region. According to Andrew 
Thomas, chairman of YLNI's Community Impact 
Committee, the group has several projects in the 
planning stages, including a Port Wayne Metro Bike 
Race, a Fort Mini-Marathon, and an An Support Fest. 

YLNI has already set up the Barr Street Market for 
the last three Saturdays in September and the first 
Saturday in October. The event will have various 
vendors selling their goods and live acoustic music

The organization also offers monthly programs for 
personal development that deal with topics such as

Mich Albom's bestselling hooks remind us of what truly 
matters in life. Called "a beautifully written book of 
great clarity and wisdom," Tuesdays with Morrie is 
Albom's touching memoir of his visits to his dying 
professor, Morrie Schwartz, and the life lessons learned 
along the way. In September 2003, Albom released his 
first novel, The Fire People You Meet in Heaven, which 
debuted at No. 1 on The New \brk Times bestsellers list 
and sold nearly five million copies in its first year. 
Albom is a columnist for the Detroit Free Press and has 
been named America's best sports columnist 13 times 
in the last 15 years. He hosts the The Mitch Albom 
Show, a nationally syndicated radio program, and is a 
regular commentator for ESPN's The Sports Reporters.

according to Maurer, on the 
highest level of a threat system 
to an attack by Soviet missiles. 
But as the Cold War fizzled out, 
so did the threat. 

"The government came up 
with a categorization," said 
Maurer. "It was based upon 
industrial prowess capability. 
Category one means it would 
be most likely to be hit first." 

To further explain the 
shrinking threat posed to Fort 
Wayne, in 1988, International 
Harvester, a company that made 
chassis and axles for military 
vehicles, hatted production and 
pulled out of the city. 

Also, companies such as 
Magnavox, ITT, BAE and Dana 
downsized their area plants, 
consolidated with other 
companies and spread out 
across the country, leaving 
Fort Wayne defense industry

Security fails to help student 



I was a lucky participant of the 
Summer Bridge program at IPFW. It 
was a good opportunity for me to know 
the university. While thf program was 
going on we had a rummer uf speakers. 
Among [hem was someone representing 



thai there were ( ameras everywht 
were very happy about that. 

Later, on returning u&gt; ( .ole ( .ommons 
after the weekend, I discovered my 
locked bicycle was missing. No one 
knew anything about it. Security asked 
a lot of questions, so they can make a 
lol of statistical analysis about me and 
my bike. We never heard anything hum 
Security again. 

When we visited the secuily office 
to ask about the videos, they acted like 
there was nothing they could do with 



watch. I bet if Dr Warlell had his bike 
stolen they would have watched the 
video record. They acted as if my bike 
was worthless and showed a poor sense 
of psychology in handling the case. For 
me- I am penniless. I have no natural 
family support. For me, my $140 bike 
is as valuable as one of IPFW's $20,000 
overhead projectors. 

1 think the security people should 
learn a little pyschology and I think 
the university should invest in a syslem 
where the videos can be sped up. And 
! think sending security people to talk 
lo us at Summer Bridge was a waste of 
time. K got our hopes up that they cared 
about student property.

Comparisons of smokers unjust 



Before I state my extreme 
disappointment due to u recent letter to 
tbeCommunicaior.allownieloclarifymy 
position on an issue. I am a non-smoker. 
It is a decision I made as a teenager 
as 1 watched my great-grandfather be 
forced to use an oxygen tank due to 
complications from emphysema. 1 saw 
the pain that he was in, how he was 
always short of breath, and I vowed that 
I personally wouldn't smoke. 

However, 1 understand that there are 
those out there who like to smoke, who 
find il relaxing and enjoyable. They have 
every right to smoke Hut what about my 
rights'' Is it being fair to my civil liberties 
that I have to breathe cigarette smoke? 
Most of my classes last year were in 
Classroom Medical, and I would always 
have to figure out which entrance to go 
in for class. The entrance by the library 
always had one or two smokers, the 
main entrance usually had six lo eight 
smokers, and even the entrance by the 
Science Building would usually have 



For everyone out there, let me finish 
the story of the lews of Warsaw. Poland. 
Over 500,000 Jews were placed within 
an area of I square mile to live. Then, 
in 1942, in a three month period, over, 
300,000 of those inhabitants were sent 
to concentration camps, ranging from 
Auschwitz- Hirkenau to Hergen-Belsen. 
There, they were killed by either gas 
chamber or shooting or subjected to 
medic al experiments I lien, their bodies 
were either buried in mass graves or 
burned in giant crematories that would 
spread the ash from the bodies for 
miles surrounding the camps. In April 






it despite all ol this, I still think the 
smoking policy is a little harsh. Maybe 
they (the university) should build a few 
more smoking huts and that would 
solve the problem. But according to the 
American Lung Association, "every year, 
close to 342,000 Americans die of lung 
disease", while "secondhand smoke is 
thought to cause the deaths of 3,000 
Americans every year, and the number 
for cardiovascular deaths is even higher, 
between 37,000 to 50,000 deaths per 
year". So why should 1 have to die from 
a disease if 1 never participated in what 
causes it? 

Now that I have that off my chest, 
allow me to respond to the second reason 
that I am writing this letter. In the letter 
responding to. Art Gonzalez 



Jews died. Men, women, and children, 
all killed. 

Over SIX MILLION JEWS were 
summarily executed simply for their 
religious beliefs The goal of the Nazis 
was to wipe each Jew off of the face of 
the planet. Smokers, despite any sense 
of feeling mistreated, have it lucky. If 
you disagree, go watch Schindler's List'. 
Then, just maybe you will remember 
that you still have more rights than 
any Jew in the Warsaw Ghetto or any 
other concentration camp ever had. 
And saying thai hoth smokers now and 
Jews then were labeled 'second class" 
citizens is a mistake. For Jews in the 
Warsaw Ghetto, "second class" would 
have been an upgrade over what the 
Nazis considered them.

Warsaw, at first. But as we all know, it

Blame the Electoral College and heavily 
partisan politics. For the first time, people 
voted for a party that was bad for their place 
in life (poor people voting Republican, 
small business owner's voting Democrat) 
because of religious or social reasons (read: 
gay marriage and abortion). 

This set the stage thai people would vote 
only because of the party and not because 
of the real issues (taxes, war, security) and 
the people will not change their minds, the 
issues are too personal to sway them. 

You can sway a person's view of taxes or 
possibly a war, but you can't sway a person 
on their religion or thoughts on abortion. 
Go ahead and try it if you don't agree. 

So, if people are voting with 
solidarity, then you only have to pander 
(and thus care) about the people that 
traditionally vote for you, Well, and the rare 
swing voter, which is almost an endangered 
species. 

Traditionally, the black population of 
America votes Democrat, not Republican, 
so the NeoCon Republican George Bush 
does not care about black people, at all. 

All he cares about is votes, his war, and 
not much else. The nature of politics since 
Clinton is very black-and-white from some 
perspectives. 

This is the same reason neither Bush 
nor Kerry came to Indiana during the 
election. ..neither care about Indiana... this 
is a "red" stale and why fight St. 

It is all about those rare swings, and lace 
it, the black population is "blue." "George

For those barely dressed students |tist tun ot high school maybe

Regardless of what you believe you are not projecting a positive

You may just be rebelling or maybe nobody has had enough 
respect for you to be honest about your appearance. What ever

respect yourself then other people will too." 

You might be surprised lion negative!) people react towards 
someone that is barely dressed and parading around campus or 
in public view. The majority of the students come here to educate 
themselves and would prefer not to be distracted by the visual 
image of a barely dressed student. If you think about it, there 
are plenty of "Gendemen's Clubs" around for that type of visual 



activity, whichever side of the pole you wish to be on. Most people 
would agree thai all body types look more attractive when properly

Among Pope's concerns when he

July 2001 was the design of the office

setup was not complimentary to what 
they needed to hold all of the coaches 
of a Division 1 program. 

To help the facility in its growth 
to reach that of an average Division [ 
school, Pope instituted what he calls 
"quick fixes." Among those was the 

addition of furniture to the reception area and a wall full of 
memorabilia honoring the sport -t aster (.ales, l'ope also noted the 
good job that lid Si hmitt and third shilt painters did in giving the

six degrees is a new feature where we link an IPFW athlete or coach to a celebrity, this week, we link Justin Timberlake to D.J. Posley 




As the publicity mounted regarding the record this 
season, and a countdown at home panics marking down 
the number of kills she needed to break the record, Souza 
remained unphased. 

"I was surprised in the hist game this weekend," Souza 
said, "i didn't think that I would have that many kills, 26. 
I had ten to go, in the second match and afterwards 
(oath Hartley informed me that 1 broke the record." 

Never really feeling the pressure of breaking the 
record in the first place. Sou/a continued to play for the 
tournament title: "I was very happy that I broke it at the 
beginning of the season, but there was not any pressure. 
That was never the focus." 

After hearing that she broke the record, Douglas 
(bead coach of Indiana lech's volleyball team) stated: "I 
couldn't be happier for her. She is very kind and hard- 
working, I love that she is the one that heat it. Being able 
to be associated with someone with that kind of talent 
and ability is rewarding for me, as a coach and a former 
player." 

With the record chase behind her, Sou/a looks forward 
to a goal 

"Our goal this year is to have 25 wins and good 
defense. Personally, I want to lie a good leader and set a 
good example lor the rest of the team." 

Those goals shouldn't be too hard for Souza or the 
rest of the team; Sou/a ranks 2\" in the nation with 5.29 
kills per game and she has the potential to lead her 20 lh 
ranked and undefeated team to another independent 
championship. Their winning altitude and 
t nearly as new as their d: 

"They believe that i hey .ire going to win every game that 
they play," Douglas said. "They have such a competitive 
altitude and such a drive, that has been IPFW volleyball's 
i matter what division they play in, they 
expect to win, 

Alter setting the record of most career kills, digs kills 
latch and digs in a matcli, Douglas transitioned to 



the coaching side of volleyball in 2005. Unlike Douglas, 
Souza does not plan on participating in the sport as a 
coach: "1 don't know what 1 am going to do. 1 could stay 
here, I could go home, or I could play professionally in 
Europe. I haven't decided yet." 

But for now, Souza is content with concentrating on 
this season. On Sept. 20, IPFW plays Ball State, where 
Souza will be recognized for her new record and Douglas 
will be in attendance. 

"Congratulations to her." Douglas said. "It is such an 
' accomplishment. I am sure that her record will stand for 
a long t"

Paintings at the FWMA 

■ Debra Zlotsky's paintings take a different perspective on traditional art 



Photo courtesy of the Fort Wayne Museum of Art /www.fwmoa.org 

DUCHBOY: This recent artwork, called Dutchboy a piece is from 
Zlotsky's book series. 



The paintings ol l lohnrah /loisfv are a must see at the 
Fort Wayne Museum of Art from now until Oct. 30. This 
exhibition contains paintings from her book series, 2002* 
2003 and still lifes, 2002-2004. 

In creating her book series, Zlotsky gives recognition 
to the artists that have inspired her most. She represents 
each book from a different perspectives showing all of a 
particular piece or just parts. 

In Zlotsky's artist biography, she explains how she 
represents these great works, "i place the work in the 
context I had experienced it, hoping to reveal both the 
intensity and the inadequacy of such an experience." 

Zlotsky's latest work is a still-life series. She chooses 
single objects, art reproductions and even uses drawings 
created by her son Max as her subject matter. Some of 
these paintings direct your attention to a cultural object 
like a pizza hnx or a roiled tip piece of paper. 

Zlotsky gives further information in her biography 
about these still-lifes, "I'm drawn to relationships that 
emerge between the flat image and the physicality of the 
object, the recognizable reference and the unfamiliar 
setting..." 



Zlotsky has a unique perspective that keeps you looking 
at every aspect of each painting. She is an illusionist and 
her paintings use powerful imagery. 

When viewing these paintings your eyes are fooled 
into believing that you are seeing a three-dimensional 
nbjeci. although your brain is aware that it is, in fact, two- 
dimensional. 

The attention she gives to each painting is apparent. 
Her paintings are rich with depth; one will find their self 
falling inioih.se mi rii. ac ies of pieces, as their imagination 
is invoked by the events detailed in the work. 

She truly transforms a canvas into a visual story that 
onlookers will find themselves transported into. Her 
paintings have a simple beauty about them and at the 
same time an indescribable elegance. 

Realism is the natural term to describe Zlotsky's work, 
but she lends explanation as to why she doesn't refer to 
her work as realism. 

"Realism to me is a preoccupation with the power of 
the familiar that creates an entrance to something less 
familiar." She says, "In a superficial way, realism seems 
more connected to non-fiction than fiction." 

Zlotsky received her BA in History of Arts, with Honors 
from Yale University, and her MFA in Painting/Drawing 
with Nigh Honors from University of Connecticut. She 
has had solo and group exhibitions in Museums,
