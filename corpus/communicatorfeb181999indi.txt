Radio station 
may be in 
campus future 

by Angela VanDaele 
Staff Writer 

The communication department has 
shown interest in starting a university- 
based and run radio station. 

Many members of the faculty have 
been discussing the usefulness and possi- 
bilities that a campus radio station would 
bring to both IPFW and the community in 
general. 

"Our first priority is making sure 
our students are served well. An on-cam- 
pus radio station will allow our majors to 
gain valuable radio and audio production 
experience," Steven Can, assistant profes- 
sor of communication, said. 

In the 1970s 1PFW had a radio station 
called WIPU that was shut down due to 
conflict between the administration and 
the station staff. 

The license from WIPU was subse- 
quently transferred to a community group 
that began WBNI-FM, a non-commercial 
radio station. 

"At this point in time, there is little 
chance of a campus over-the-air station 
due to limitations on FCC licenses," 
Jonathan Tankel, associate professor and 
director of graduate studies in the com- 
munication department, said. 

A Low-Power FM station {LPFM) of 
one-watt power would serve an area with 
a diameter of up to two miles. There is 
also a 1,000-watt station covering an area 
of approximately eighteen miles, said 
Tankel. 

"Until the proposal is approved and 
procedure established, the process is an 
unknown. Therefore, the extent of any 
legal issues is also unknown," Tankel said. 
If LPFM were approved, a campus sta- 
tion would have to be authorized b&gt; 
administration. 

Funds for a radio station could come 
from administrative support, student gov- 
ernment and grants, 

Another option is an Internet radio 
station. 

"An Internet radio station would be a 
much easier process to approve because 
there Is no off-campus approval needed," 
said Tankel. 

"I would like to see an Internet radio 
station started on campus as soon as pos- 
sible. If one is started it would be able to 
be accessed by anyone on the web," said 
Carr. 

During a departmental meeting held 
on Monday, Feb. 15, it was decided to 
continue an investigation on a radio 
station. 

On Thursday, March 4, from 8 to 
9:30 p.m., a meeting to answer questions 
will be held in the Science Building, Rm. 
185. 



Funding: Lobbying group requests increased funds for campus 



by Mishanna Wood, 
News-Editor 

The facts are unchanged. The 
requests are unchanged. More 
funds are needed at IPFW. 

During Higher Education 
Lobbying Day last Wednesday, Feb. 
10, 80 students, 10 faculty, 30 
alumni and Republican candidate 
for mayor Linda Buskirk traveled to 
Indianapolis to lobby for equity 
funding from the state. 

IPFW is still ranked fourteenth 
out of fifteen schools among other 
public schools funded by Indiana. 

According to "IPFW, Funding 
for the new millennium, a faculty 
perspective by the Budgetary 
Affairs Committee," the following 
funds were requested for the '99- 
'00 semester: S45 1,083 for enroll- 



ment change funding, S947.895 for 
technology funds, SI, 000,000 for 
equity adjustment, SI, 6000,000 for 
quality improvement and 
S3, 297, 438 for the increase or 
decrease of state appropriations. 

In all of these requests a ques- 
tion mark fills the space for the cat- 
egory marked "North-East Area 
Legislators Response." 

The pamphlet stated that, 
"Northeastern Indiana legislators 
must take the lead in providing an 
adequate legislative response to the 
current recommendations of ICHE 
(Indiana Commission for Higher 
Education) and the Budget Agency." 

While on the buses, the lobby- 
ing groups were informed of IPFW's 
issues, how to lobby and what do to 
when a budget comes up for a vote. 

The lobbyists had a private 
meeting with Senator Dave Long 



and Senator Tom Wyss. 

The students spoke with 
Senator Charles Meeks, 
Representative Robert Alderman, 
Representative Gary Dillon, 
Representative Ben GiaQuinta, 
Representative Win Moses and 
Representative David Wolkins. 

"Sometimes students spoke one 
on one and other times a group of 
twenty people stood around and 
spoke to a representative," Joe 
Schroeder, IPSGA president, said. 

"We told ihem about the cam- 
pus problems such as not having 
proper training due to the need of 
current equipment," added 
Schroeder. 

The twelve-hour day ended 
with a Higher Education Rally at the 
Embassy Suites from 4 to 5:30 p.m. 

All the schools that attended 
made plans on how to lobby 



next year. 

"This one had the largest 
attendance. It shows legislators that 
students, alumni and faculty care 
about campus. It's too soon to tell 
what will happen. The legislators 
will remember this turn-out. 
Hopefully it will have a very' posi- 
tive impact," said Walt Branson, 
vice chancellor of financial affairs. 

Not everyone feels the same 
way, however. 

"I think the impact this year 
will be minimal, 1 ' said Jennifer Bosk, 
director of Alumni Services. "It usu- 
ally takes a longer time to make 
these changes. I believe we need to 
keep very vocal in the next two 
years, and this will greatly impact 
the budget in 2001."

Mastodon Stomp showcases speaking talents 



by Mishanna Wood, 
News Editor 

Students from ten universities gathered at 
IPFW on Saturday, Feb. 13, to "speak their stuff" 
at the annual Mastodon Stomp forensics tourna- 
ment from 7:30 a.m to 7:30 p.m. 

Indiana University was the overall winner. 
Ball State was second and North Central was 
third. 

IPFW did not place as a team in the tourna- 
ment because it was the host school. 

However, IPFW had two individuals place: 
Dan Westrick, senior, and Sarah Strom, senior. 

Strom placed second in impromptu story 
telling. 

In impromptu story' telling, competitors are 
given a subject and have to prepare a story and 
present it— all within seven minutes. 



Competitors have to advance through two 
rounds to participate in the finals round. Each 
round has a different topic. 

"Jerry Falwell and Tinky Winky are my best 
friends. I had to imagine that Jerry Falwell and 
Tinky Winky were testifying at Clinton's impeach- 
ment trial. That's what everyone had to tell their 
siory on," Strom said. 

Jerry Falwell is a minister who wrote an arti- 
cle stating that Tinky Winky, a Teletubbie, is gay. 

Westrick placed fifth in the category of dra- 
matic interpretation, 

"I was happy 1 was able to compete at home 
and win a trophy at home," said Westrick. 

Westrick has won other competitions with 
his humorous role as a depressed man from the 
play "Siobhan" written by Sherry Anderson. 

He recently placed fifth at Purdue and fourth 
at Transylvania University in Lexington, 
Kentucky. 



"Each event is so different from the other. IU 
always has great competitors. Illinois and Eastern 
Michigan did really well," said Sarah Nichter, 
director of Forensics and associate faculty of 
communication. 

There were 11 categories at the tournament; 
extemporaneous speech, prose interpretation, 
informative, rhetorical criticism, impromptu 
speaking, persuasion, poetry, dramatic duo, after- 
dinner speaking, dramatic interpretation and 
program oral interpretation. 

According to Nichter, there were approxi- 
mately 120 students and coaches from all the 
schools involved. 

The ten schools that attended were Saint 
Joseph College, Purdue, Eastern Michigan 
University, Indiana University, University of 
Illinois, Wabash College, Ball State University, 
North Central College and the University of 
Indianapolis. 



As the twenty-first century comes 
closer, anyone owning an electronic 
device that has a microprocessor 
should be preparing for the Y2K bug or 
year 2000 problem. 

Building environmental control 
systems, personal computers, elevator 
control systems, appliances, computer 
servers, digital watches and point-of- 
sale registers are a few devices that will 
be affected by Y2K. 

The year 2000 subcommittee at 
IPFW is just one of the many businesses 
that must work against the clock to 
avoid the possible breakout of chaos 
next January- 
Many electronic devices only have 
a two-digit system to represent a date. 
If this system is not corrected the date 
will roll back to 1900 instead or 2000. 

"Software that Is not year 2000 
compliant, such as a piece of account- 
ing software, has January 20, 1999, for 
a typical date. A lot of programmers 
did not put in a four-digit field. They 
put in a two-digit field. What comes 
after '99 is '00. It's a hardware and soft- 
ware problem. Systems hardware that 
does not understand the date 2000 will 
think it needs to go back to the year 
1900 and the system won't have the 
correct date. It's hazy on what will 
occur, people ask me is the computer is 
going die or not work," Gary Steffen, 
visiting assistant professor of electrical 
and computer engineering, said. 

An example of a problem that 
Steffen gave was in a bank. One could 
place S100 in an accounttin December 
1999. A month later, in the year 2000, 
the computer will think the money has 
been in an account since 1900. 

There would be extra interest 
added on to the account. Banks and 
insurance companies could lose a lot of 
money if any piece of software is not 
updated. 

According to Steffen, there are 
three solutions to the Y2K problem: 
First of all one could replace the com- 
puter or electrical device, secondly the 
BIOS in the computer which keeps 
track of the systems hardware, date and 
time, could be up-dated, finally one can 
use a year 2000 compliant computer 
which has a four-digit system that can 
be manually updated.

Young Republicans, Young Democrats seek student membership 



by Sarah Christie 
Staff Writer 



Currently, IPFW does not have a political 
chapter of either the Young Republicans or 
Young Democrats. 

However, both organizations are seeking 
active participation from IPFW students 
because only a small number of young people 
are involved in politics today. 

Since last May, the Allen County Young 
Republicans have been planning ways to 
increase membership. The organization con- 
sists of men 3nd women, ages 17-50. Members 
who are 17 must turn 18 by the day of the 
next general election. 

The Young Republicans want to give 
young people in the community a chance to 
support Republican candidates and achieve a 
higher level of learning about the political 
process. 

"The Young Republicans are a way stu- 
dents can gel firsthand involvement with poli- 



tics," said Emily Sieigmeyer, Internal vice pres- 
ident of the Young Republicans. 

By becoming a Young Republican, mem- 
bers will have the opportunity to work with 
candidates on campaigns. 

The meetings for the Young Republicans 
are sometimes informal. Lately, the organiza- 
tion has been meeting at Munchie Emporium 
to make the meetings social, as well as political 
and educational. Formal meetings are held at 
the Republican Headquarters. 

On February 24, at 7:30 p.m., in Kettler 
G46, two Republican primary' candidates will 
hold a public information night sponsored by 
the political science department. 

Candidates Joe Squadrito and Linda 
Buskirk will each talk about the upcoming race 
and have a question and answer session for the 
students. A table will be available after the pre- 
sentations for students to register to vote. 

In addition to public information nights, 
the Young Republicans have a newsletter called 
the "Elephants Tale." This newsletter informs 



members of the next meeting and touches on 
current political issues. 

According to Dave Mathieu, president of 
the Young Republicans, "The Young 
Republicans want members to enjoy them- 
selves, increase their understanding, and to 
make informed choices on election day." 

For more information on the Young 
Republicans, call Republican Headquarters at 
422-1554. 

The Allen County Young Democrats arc 
men and women, ages 18-35, who meet to dis- 
cuss political ideas and ongoing political inno- 
vations. 

"The Young Democrats provide a starting 
point into the political process," said Tim Pape, 
who is running for 5th District City Council. 

The Young Democrats provide a way for 
young people to become involved in the com- 
munity. The organization meets once a month. 

Their next meeting is scheduled for March 
3 at 7 p.m., at the Democratic Headquarters. 
During the meetings, members can discuss dif- 



ferent political issues such as candidates and 
campaigns. 

"The meetings are political, social, and 
educational; you can get what you want out of 
them," said Brian S. Kenworthy, interim county 
chair. 

"The Young Democrats is great for individ- 
uals to meet with others their own age in the 
community to make a difference," said Tilden 
Brown, member of the Young Democrats. 

With the upcoming election year, the 
Young Democrats want to grow and reorganize. 
Their goal is to keep the organization going 
strong throughout the &gt; ears between elections. 

Overall, the Young Democrats want to pro- 
vide IPFW students with the opportunity to 
become active in politics and voice their opin- 
ions to the community. 

For more information on the Allen County 
Young Democrats, call the Democratic 
Headquarters at 478-8239.

TOPIC: 

Senate Bills 

WHAT WE THINK: 

More nonsense 



The State of Ohio is known for making up 
irregular rules and statutes. 

A few years back, the state legislature 
passed a law making it legal to point the right 
hand towards the passenger side of the car 
when making a right-hand turn. 

Seeing the "hand turn signal" would be 
impossible in many cars with passengers or 
dark windows. 

Last week another Ohio legislator had some 
rather "unique" legislation to the U.S. Senate. 

Ohio Senator Mike DeWine introduced two 
bills which seem very questionable. 

The first, Senate Bill 411, would allow law 
enforcement agents a limited ability to clone 
the pagers of suspected drug dealers. We don't 
quite see where the legislators are going with 
this invasion of privacy. 

This is one of those bills that is just going 
to lead to other things. What if they don't stop 
with beepers? 

They could move on to cell phones and 
electronic mail, then with whatever new tech- 
nology comes along. 

It's reassuring to hear that the legislators 
are concerned with the drug problems of 
America, but you can only go so far until the 
rights of average people are being taken away. 
If they pass this bill, no one will be safe. 

It gives law enforcement agencies the abili- 
ty to track the correspondences of anyone sus- 
pected of being a drug dealer. This seems to 
violate the 4th Amendment of the Constitution. 

Equally disturbing is the second of the 
bills, Senate Bill 413, which allows people to be 



found guilty of a crime if the crime is not com- 
pleted, but merely attempted. 

We think the legislators are using this bill 
to toughen up on crime by making criminals 
more leery of attempting to commit a crime. 

We see this bill as punishing the bungling 
criminals without raising the mark for the peo- 
ple who actually commit the crime. 

For example, what if a person were to shoot 
someone, intending to kill, but just missed the 
mark. Could this person be punished as a mur- 
derer? 

Under this bill it seems as if it could hap- 
pen. Another example would be of someone 
who tries to break into a home, but is unsuc- 
cessful. Could this person could be punished 
for stealing the homeowner's life savings? 

For a final example, a person who is walk- 
ing around lifting up car handles might be 
arrested for grand theft auto. 

There are all kind of tangents that can be 
drawn from this example. 

With proposed legislation like this, the 
American people should be concerned with 
where their rights as citizens are going. 

It seems as if they are flying right out the 
window of the Capitol. People need to take 
stand against these unjust attempts to railroad 
the rights of everyone, or else we might as well 
go back to the days of British rule. 



"We enact many laws that 
manufacture criminals and 
then a few that punish 
them."

From the mind of a Madman

THE RISE III TECHNOLOGY 



Just the other day I saw an adver- 
tisement for the new Intel Pentium III 
chip. 

It made me first think that tech- 
nology is moving at an incredible 
rate. 

My parents bought a top-of-the- 
line computer three years ago and it 
cost more than the top-of-the-line 
computer 1 bought last year. 

Their computer was a Pentium 75 
with 8 MB of RAM, Windows 95 and a 
1-gig HD. My computer was a 333 
mHz Pentium 11 with 32 MB of RAM, 
Windows 98 and a 3.2 gig HD. 

For those of you without the 
technical jargon, mine was a lot big- 
ger. 

The second thing that the com- 
mercial made me wonder is where all 
of this technology leading us. 

One thought that I had was much 
like the writings of Theodore 
Kaczinsky:Technology will eventually 
be the downfall of man. This is much 
like George Orwell's "1984." 

All of this technology keeps mak- 
ing people more wealthy, greedy and 
sociopathic. 

Last year alone, the Internet 
lined the pockets of individuals lucky 
enough to take advantage of the mar- 
keting possibilities to the tune of over 
SI billion. 

More people are trying to find 
their niches in cyberspace everyday. 

Many people feel put off by soci- 
ety, so they maintain electronic rela- 



tionships. 

People also use the Internet and 
e-mail services to lure children and 
others to fulfill their perverted needs. 

You have probably heard some of 
the horror stories. 

Technology, however, is leading 
us is to a simpler and more leisurely 
lifestyle for everyone. 

I know that this is a bit of a 
stretch, but then again, when is any- 
thing 1 write not a stretch? 

I think that eventually you will 
have a mainframe computer in your 
house the size of the computers that 
we now use. 

It will control all of the aspects of 
your household: heating, security, 
lighting, timers, bills, schedules, busi- 
ness operations, and anything else 
you can think of. I think this change 
is a lot closer than you think. 

The way things have progressed 
in the past few years, I would feel safe 
by saying that this will happen before 
many of you are ready to retire. 

Along with this technology, I feel 
that there will be an increased rise in 
environmental awareness, and prob- 
lems like deforestation and worldwide 
overpopulation will become ideas of 
the past. 

People will use significantly less 
paper, and I wouldn't be surprised if 
children of the future won't even be 
able to make paper airplanes, not for 
their lack of curiosity or inventive- 
ness, but because paper will most 



likely be used sparingly. 

I don't think worldwide overpop- 
ulation will be a problem, because 
people probably won't want to have 
as many children. 

They'll probably have enough 
children to keep the family lineage 
going. 

People will probably be more 
refined in their everyday lives, and 
might even take time to enjoy the arts 
and sciences, be happy with each 
other, not worry about what people 
think of them and take notice of the 
simple things in life. 

Then again, I have been known 
for being wrong sometimes.

As I write this, it Is now 
day 324 and counting. 

Lately, being the deep 
thinker that I, your ear to the 
world, am, I have turned a 
fair portion of my prodigious 
brain to the controversy sur- 
rounding the Y2K. 

Having ruminated upon 
this very thing for days, I had 
reached no decision and 
decided to enlist the 
resources of other minds in 
my endeavor. 

What better minds could 
I tap than those of the college 
campus, and what better 
campus than on the Fort 
Wayne Campus of old 1U and 
PU. 

After arriving at this 
decision I laid myself down 
for a nap and then sprang 
into action, throwing two of 
my old Nam war buddies, 
Chopper and Hammerhand, 
into the fields to accost... that 
is, to take the pulse of the 
campus. 

After letting Chopper 
and Hammer loose upon the 
world, 1 settled down to do 
some research on my own. 

As knowledgeable as I, 
your humble guide and ear, 
am I still found much to be 
known concerning this 
impending event. 

For one thing I discov- 
ered that the potential prob- 
lem was caused by the con- 
servation of memory space at 
the dawn of the computer 
age. 

To save space, program- 
mers at that time used only 
two digits for the year instead 
or four. Thus 1999 would be 
99 and so forth. 

Little thought was given 
to potential problems at the 
time feeling certain that all 
would be well by the turn of 
the century. Well, "Gol-leee," 
1 here we are and boy is our 
i^/ace red! "Shazzamm!" . 



The theory' is that upon 
reaching the year 2000 com- 
puters would see "00" and 
either read 1900, no date, or 
Feb. 27. 1963. Wincing at the 
thought of my junior year 
and not wishing to relive that 
particular time. I vowed to 
devote all my energies to 
diverting this possible glitch 
(Well, at least till lunch). 

Speaking of glitches, a 
staff writer for CNET 
News.com, one Paul Festa, in 
his article titled; "Microsoft 
site still buggy to communica- 
tor" reported on Netscape's 
problem with access to one of 
the software giant's sites. 

Says Mr. Festa, 
"Ironically, both the form (for 
placing an order) and the 
page were part of Microsoft's 
site devoted to helping users 
prepare for the mother of all 
glitches, the year 2000 prob- 
lem." 

Said Microsoft 

spokesman Adam Sohn, 
"Occasionally something's 
gonna slip through." Warms 
the cockles of ole Don's heart. 

As I settled deeper into 
the sofa and pulled my hat 
lower over my eyes, the door 
seemed to explode and my 
two cronies came through, 
and by grunts and handsig- 
nals, communicated to me 
that they had arrived with 
some success. 

Satisfied that they had 
not frightened everyone 
away, I perused their 
responses. 

One respondent, Jason 
C, remarked, "If you have a 
lot of assets and money and 
stuff, and you're real worried 
about it, I suppose you 
should be preparing for it." 

Well, there are ways and 
then there are ways, right 
Jason? 

In his article, "The Year 
2000 Bug Meets Reople. 



Problem," author Barnaby J. 
Feder comments on the way 
some are preparing. He 
writes, "Polls show that 
around 10 percent of 
Americans expect to with- 
draw most )r all of their 
money from banks." 

Another student, Shane 
H., a criminal justice major, 
has all the confidence in the 
world and believes that "if 
there are that many people 
worrying about it, there has 
to be someone smart enough 
to figure it out." 

When asked if he were 
overly concerned about the 
Y2K situation, Shane respond- 
ed that he was "letting the 
computer nerds figure this 
thing out." 

Nicole J., a special ed. 
major, also feels the same as 
Shane on the subject and 
states, "Those computer 
nerds like Bill Gates and all 
them, they're gonna be able 
to figure it all out." 

Ah, the confidence of the 
young in the nerds of yester- 
year who have become the 
Bill Gates of today. 

However, as a criminal 
justice major, Shane might be 
interested in a report by 
Erich Luening, staff writer for 
CNET NEWS.COM, entitled, 
"Bill would keep Y2K out of 
courts." 

In his report, Mr. 
Luening states that the Senate 
is now debating a bill which 
would offer companies Y2K 
glitch protection from law- 
suits which were making 
"good faith efforts to solve 
the Y2K." 

This bill was submitted 
by Senator John McClain (R- 
Arizona) who said its purpose 
is "to ensure that we look to 
solving the technology glitch 
rather than clog our courts 
with years of costly litiga- 
tion."

1 have no idea what I just 
said, but I've seen it in every 
single Internet chat room I've 
ever been in. 

Internet slang has to be 
the worst slam on the English 
language since Ebonics, but at 
least Ebonics makes some 
sense- it's a "street" language 
(even if the "street" is in the 
uburbs). But the average 
Internet chatter is somebody 
with next-to-no social skills. 
Half of the time In those 
rooms, everyone is lying any- 
way. 

I recently read a book 
.tided "Byte Me!" which was 
a Comedy Central parody on 
the popular "For Dummies" 
computer book series. In this 
book, it said that the average 
break-down on "lesbian" chat 
room participants showed 24 
out of 25 of the "lesbians" 
were teen-aged males. 

But, back to the awful 
geek language. 1 personally 
would not be caught dead 
riting any of the stupid 
slang words, and I major in 
computer science. 

OK, where to begin? 
LOL"? What in the world 



does this mean? I've heard 
"laugh out loud," "lots of 
love" and (my own) "loser 
online." Who came up with 
that one, Forrest Gump? It's 
stupid. Is it pronounced "L-O- 
L" or "Lowell?" 

Someone in a chat room 
said "DPKOYL" to me the 
other day. I had no idea what 
it meant I also didn't want to 
be embarrassed and actually 
ASK what it meant, so I left 
the room. I still don't know 
what it means, so if anyone 
does, e-mail me at per- 
rmwOWhoimes.ipfVi.edu and 
tell me. Next time I start a 
chat room, I'm going to name 
it "No Slang!" and get a bunch 
of people who hate slang, and 
punt off-line anybody that 
uses slang in my room. 

What about those 
"Emotlcons?" If you don't 
know what an Emoticon is, I 
will give you the Emoticon to 
show how I feel when I see an 
Emoticon ":(". "Emoticon" 
comes from the two words 
"emotion" and "icon." So, 
they are "icons" to show 
"emotions." 

Somebody once said, 
"Wait a minute. I can screw 
with great grammatical sym- 



bols and make them look like 
smiley faces. LOL!" 

Too bad this moron did- 
n't program them to say 
"Have a nice day" out of the 
computer speakers. 

I've seen new programs 
like "MS Office '97" and "AOL 
Instant Messenger" which 
automatically transforms the 
Emoticon :) to a smiley face. 
As stupid as it may sound, 
somebody actually got paid to 
sit around and program 
something so mind-bogglingly 
useless as this, Why? 

But, right now, I'm won- 
dering how many years it will 
be until people start talking 
In Internet slang on the 
streets, and the governm 
will be forced to make 
"In tonic" (Internet-phonics) 
into a national language, as 
they almost did with Ebonics 
a few years ago. 

So, in conclusion, if any 
body walks up to you on the 
street and says "Hi. I'm John, 
LOL" 

Shoot him between the 
eyes with your gat and walk 
away feeling as if you made 
the world a better place. : P 



Y2K Problem, continued from Page 1 



The Y2K committee at 
1PFW is communicating with 
Purdue on the situation. 
C&amp;DP services (Computer and 
Data Processing) is testing of 
all the systems to see if they 
are year 2000 compliant. 

"Four times representa- 
tives have gone down to 
Purdue to meet and discuss 
the project. They are waiting 
for updates on the vendors 
lists, which are being com- 
piled of campus wide soft- 
ware. Information is being 
gathered by manufacturers to 
see if they have any issues 
ilh the year 2000," Jean- 
Paul Carter, a nenvork sys- 
tems programmer for C&amp;DP 
Services, said. 

"To address the problem 
in general, computers are tied 
into control systems for 
everything when 2000 comes 
along. Electric grids may not 
be able to function. There 
may be a loss of electricity. 



Wrong periods of time will he 
shown. It won't be possible to 
keep track of records. 
Companies won't be able to 
communicate correctly. The 
problem has to be looked at 
across the board. Anything 
with electronics where a date 
is programmed in a microchip 
with a clock needs to be 
checked to see what will hap- 
pen in the year 2000," said 
Bruce Arnold, manager of life 
sciences and support services 
in the biology department. 

According to Arnold, the 
mainframe system computers, 
such as those that control the 
registration and the Bursars 
Office, have been updated. 
Individual desktop computers 
will have old programs 
removed over the summer, 
Macintosh computers have 
been found to be "immune" 
to year 2000 problem. 

Most computers will not 
completely "crash" by the 



turn of the twenty-first centu- 
ry. There are some aspects of 
a computer that are more sus- 
ceptible than others, such as 
spread sheets or database. 

"This does not mean a 
device won't totally run, it 
won't function in some 
areas," said Carter. 

The current problem of 
the Y2K committee is finding 
the funds to update the com- 
puters. 

"We don't really know 
how big the bill is yet. The 
primary source of money will 
come from a non-recurrin; 
allocation of funds from the 
state for technology. That's 
one of the things we asked 
the legislature to do. We have 
some of that money that 
held intentionally to help the 
year 2000 problem," said 
Walt Branson, vice chancellor 
of financial affairs. 



Mr. McClain goes on to 
say, "Opportunistic lawyers 
are already filing suits to 
reap the benefits of this issue 
and the calendar still reads 
February 1999. These law- 
suits are sheer craziness and 
represent ambulance-chasing 
at its worst. They are clear 
and convincing evidence that 
we will face a rash of lawsuits 
in the coming year." 

Senator McClain cited 
recent estimates of Y2K litiga- 
tion "nearing 1 trillion dol- 
lars and said such costs 
would be a major impediment 
to the stability of the nation's 
economy." 

As every coin has two 
sides, so also does the 
Senator have his nay-sayers. 
Howard Nations of the 
Attorney of Law Offices of 
Howard Nations, testified 
before a senate nearing on 
the matter. 

He said, "It seems appro- 
priate to inquire how a grant 
of immunity to procrastina- 
tors and irresponsible busi- 
ness leaders who seek to 
avoid accountability for their 
own bad business judgment 
would solve the Y2K prob- 
lems." 

Nations went on, "A 
major problem with the 
McCain Bill is that it not only 
grants immunity to the irre- 
sponsible, but also abolishes 
the rights of the responsible 
corporate business leaders, 
who acted within the law, 
who exercised reasonable 
judgment, and who met their 
duty of due care to tier cor- 
porations and their cus- 
tomers." 

Stay tuned to your "pri- 
vate ear" on this issue of liti- 
gation, for it could get inter- 
esting. 

Some of the population 
have opted to flee the con- 
Tines of the city and to go 



back to the land in advance 
of the coming New Year. 

Our next respondent, 
Abby L, believes that it could 
be done. 

When questioned con- 
cerning her beliefs on the 
Y2K, Abby echoed the state- 
ments of Shane and Nicole 
and went on to state that "the 
computers can't beat a 
human." 1 like that! Shades of 
John Henry, Abby L. (Before I 
let that computer beat me 
down, I'll die with my digital 
calibarizer in my hand, sung 
to the tune of "John H. and 
the Steam Drill"). 

When asked if she were 



that there is a program which 
can be downloaded from the 
net which can check your 
computer for readiness. 

She stated that "some 
check for software compli- 
ance and some for hardware 
compliancy and things like 
that." 

She went on to say that 
there is one program by 
Microsoft called "Win 95 Y2K 
that you can download and 
run on your computer." 
Thanks to mandy and the 
computer department. 

Now enough of this 
doom and gloom, on to some- 
thing else of interest to i

COUNTRY MUSIC HOUHD-UP 



by Ben Ruble, 
Start Writer 



Garth Brooks 

I recently noticed that, 
according to Billboard, Garth 
Brooks' "Double Live" CD has 
sold over 12 million units in 
nine weeks! This is a phe- 
nomenal amount for a dou- 
ble CD with only two new 
songs. 

The Garth Brooks name 
is so impressive. He just 
keeps selling more records. It 
is only a matter of time 
before he outdoes the Beetles 
for the unit record sales 
record. 

So, is this CD that good? 
The answer: It is great. The 
live version of "Friends In 
Low Places" is awesome. 
Garth performs the mysteri- 
ous third verse of this song. 

The song is lengthy. It 
lasts eight minutes and 56 
seconds, according to the 
back of my CD. "Unanswered 
Prayers" is spectacular. 

Thousands of people 
sing the lyrics with Garth, 
making for a nice touch to a 
great song. Most of Brooks' 
past hits are on this CD, plus 
two new songs, "Wild As the 
Wind" and "It's Your Song." 



Billy Ray Cyrus 

Billy Ray Cyrus' changed 
country music image is well 
on its way. With "Busy Man," 
I am quite impressed. 

It is about a family with 
a father who is too busy to do 
the "little things" with his 
wife and kids. He is always 
busy with work until one day 
he realizes that he needs to 
change. 

I am sure that I am not 
the only person for whom the 
song hits close to home with 
regards to their father. It is a 
great song with great mean- 
ing behind the lyrics, 

Dixie Chicks 

The Dixie Chicks have 
released yet another great 
song from the 3 million sell- 
ing "Wide Open Spaces" CD. 
"You Were Mine" offers a 
nice assortment of lyrics and 
music. The "Chicks" have 
offered a number of great 
songs on this CD and "You 
Were Mine" is no exception. 

"Keepin' Up" is a great 
new song released from 
Alabama's "for the Record" 
CD. Randy Owen, Teddy 
Gentry, and the boys of 
Alabama have released a 
great follow-up to the huge 
hit from last year, "How Do 



You Fall In Love." "Keepin' 
Up" offers a lyrical note to 
the hype of this fast-paced 
world. 

Alabama 

Speaking of Alabama, I 
do recommend that you pur- 
chase the "For the Record" 
double CD set. It has 41 great 
Alabama number one songs 
plus thres new songs from 
the most popular group in 
country music history. 

"Dancin' on the 
Boulevard" and "Angels 
Among Us" are about the 
only two songs that were 
widely popular but did not 
make it to number one and 
did not make it on this CD. 
This CD has many of my 
favorite songs, including 
"Here We Are" and "Down 
Home." It is a great CD to 
purchase. 

There are currently a 
number of great new songs 
and CDs available. Many of 
these are of the "new coun- 
try" format and could easily 
be crossover songs to the pop 
charts. I just hope they 
replace the twangy new songs 
of Alan Jackson and a 
few others.

Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering 
Technology offers credit hours for Rome trip 



by Rachel Landrum, 
Staff Writer 



Have special plans for 
dinner tonight? How about 
dining in an ancient under- 
ground theater built in 55 B.C. 
While you are underground, 
maybe you would like to see 
the excavated home of one of 
the Christians. 

Sound too good to be 
true? You can do these things 
and much more while on an 
exciting trip to Rome spon- 
sored by the IPFW Department 
of Civil and Architectural 
Engineering Technology. 

This year's trip is sched- 
uled for July 10-24. The cost 
is $2,695, which includes 
"everything except your sou- 
venirs," according to Matthew 
Kubick, associate professor of 
Architectural Engineering 
Technology at IPFW, and one 
of the tour leaders and 
instructors. 

For those who wish to 
book their own flight, ground 
only accommodations may be 
purchased for $1945. 

For less than the cost of a 
trip to Disney World, partici- 
pants can travel to ancient 
Rome to have a once in a life- 
time experience. 

They are offering this trip 
for college credits or for any- 
one interested in gaining a lit- 
tle cultural experience. In the 
past, the travelers have 
ranged in age from fifteen to 
seventy, and most have vary- 
ing areas of interest. 

Originally, according to 
Kubick, they created the trip 
to help those who may not 
otherwise have an opportuni- 
ty to travel out of town. This 
offers a unique opportunity 
for anyone to gain interna- 
tional exposure. 

Kubick adds that the trip 
is not your run-of-the-mill 
tour of popular sights. He says 
that during the ten years he 
has been involved, many con- 
nections have been made with 
the locals, in Rome that help 
him gain admittance to things 



that are not otherwise 
accessible. 

One instance he recount- 
ed was In a medieval church 
where the caretaker let his 
group open an ancient organ 
and then allowed one person 
from the group to play It. 

Kubick also states that 
you will "tour with a group of 
experts," meaning himself, 
considering this in his tenth, 
and final, year. 

The other group leaders 
are Greg Pierceall, professor of 
landscape architecture at 
Purdue University, West 
Lafayette, and Samantha Birk, 
associate faculty in art history 
and Curator of Education for 
the Fort Wayne Museum of 
Art. 

Other scheduled sights 
participants will visit include 
the Theater of Pompeii and 
the Capitoline Museums. They 
will also have the options of 
touring the Catacombs, the 
city of Palestrina or the gar- 
dens of the Villa Doria 
Pamphilli. 

You will also explore the 
excavations of the Roman 
Forum and even visit the 



Tomb of the Emperor 
Augustus. 

How does a jaunt to the 
spot where Julius Caesar was 
cremated sound? Every day on 
this tour is packed with excit- 
ing events. 

Anyone interested should

What's wrong in the sports world. 



by Matt Scrieer, 
Staff Wnter 

No, It's not a web site. It is 
what's wrong with sports these days. 

It's also the inevitable path where 
most of the conversations I have about 
sports lead to 

Believe it or not, it's not only old 
people I hear this from, either. 

As fans, we need to realize that col- 
lectively, we have helped create the cur- 
rent climate. Now we are forced to deal 
with the repercussions. 

First and foremost, sports have 
become a business. 

All of the "Big Four," NBA. NHL, NFL, 
and MLB have not only recognized this 
but capitalized on it exponentially. 

Advertising and marketing have 
become more important than league 
quality and fan satisfaction. 

One positive is that sports like golf 
and NASCAR now receive recognition, 
where before they could not compete 
with the others. 

The downside is that the average fan 
is priced out of attending these events 
because tickets are so expensive. 




Even (he NCAA and the Olympics 
have followed the same route. Now many 
fans rely on cable, satellite dishes and 
pay-per-view to see their sport of choice. 

Today most major events are cov- 
ered on network television, but I wonder 
how long until the Super Bowl, World 
Series and Final Four are pay-per-view? 

The media is as culpable as anyone. 
The documentation of Mike Tyson's rise 
and fall are a prime example. 

This same media that built him up as 
the "baddest man on the planet" now 
wash their hands with Mike, the one who 
"wasted the most talent." 

When he fights again the media will 
be selling it as usual. Now, I know Mike 
is unstable, and maybe that is part of the 
intrigue, but the same people that made 
him rich condemn him every chance they 
get. 

His actions have been reprehensible, 
yet when we continue to watch him, we 
have to take some of the blame. 

Today's athletes are only a product 
of their society. 

They have grown up being viewed as 
"special" because of their athletic 
prowess. 

They are granted special privileges 
when they are 
young, and 
before they are 
adults, they 
receive large 
amounts of 
money and 
fame. 

I can under- 
stand how they 
could get car- 
ried away. We 
can't blame 
their actions, 
especially crim- 
inal, on their 
stardom 
because some- 
where personal 
responsibility 
has to be part 
of the equation. 



ver. 



How 
: judge them 



without having any idea about their expe- 
riences. Personally, 1 don't think the 
Spreewell thing was a big deal. 

The media got hold of it, and due to 
public out cry, the NBA felt pressured to 
make a hard move. The comments I 
heard over and over were, "If I choked 
my boss, I would be fired right away." 
The sports world is not like every 
other 
industry. 

It is the entertainment industry' and 
the rules are not the same. People don't 
complain about musicians, or television 
and movie stars making obscene amounts 
of money, yet they can't get over how 
much athletes make. 

The true underlying principle is jeal- 
ousy. How would you like to play a game 
you love, and get paid millions of dollars 
to do it? Imagine being able to own any- 
thing you want. 

Imagine having financial security for 
the rest of your life, and being able to 
provide the same for your family. We 
would all love It. 

The price they pay is privacy. When 
they make mistakes, they are magnified, 
because those without enjoy seeing the 
rich go through trouble. 

We laugh and call athletes "stupid" 
for risking everything, yet we still watch. 

I, however, am not jealous. Why 
should I care if Tyson makes S3 million 
or S30 million for his next fight? 

I'm not going to get any of It. I'm 
also not going to shell out SSO to watch 
him beat some loser. If you are upset 
with the way things are going in sports, 
don't watch it. 

Don't buy the products that adver- 
tise on it, and definitely don't buy any 
merchandise relating to it. 

Most importantly don't give it too 
much importance. It's only a game. The 
world will continue to go on, even if your 
team loses the championship on the last 
play of the last game. 

So, what's wrong with sports these 
days? Nothing that hasn't been going on 
for years, only now on a much larger 
scale.
