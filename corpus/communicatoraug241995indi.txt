Campus 
welcomes 
students with 
open arms 

by Melissa Young-Flores 
News Editor 

(jetting involved in the campus community is often a difficult and scary step in 
each student's college career, 

"The studeni has to lake the first step," said Athletic Director Butch Perchan. And 
more often than not it is hard to decide which way to step and with which foot, but 
several IPFW admmistralore believe getting involved can be a lot easier than students 
may think 

Kim Jacobs, director of student activities, 
said her office door is dways open to stu- 
dents seeking to get involved. According to 
Jacobs, there are 68 recognized student 
organizauons on campus and the possibility 
to add more is certainly a reality 

Jacob reports student organizations are 
searching for new members as much as new sfii- 
dents are looking for a club to join. 

The Student Activities Office, in conjunction with the 
student organizations, will be hosting the Organizational 
Activities Fair August 30 from 1 1 a.m. to 1 p.m. . 

According to Jacobs, the fair is an excellent opportunity for sludenis to explore 
Iheir extracurricular options. She also stated students should take their time in investi- 
gating which organizations are more suitable for Ihem. 

Marian Zimmerman, dean of students, agrees with Jacobs. 'There are a lot of ways 
for students to get involved and I dunk SOAR was wonderful. A second way for slu-

to locate the corrupt transaction file without success. 




dents to get involved is the student handbook." said Zin 

Zimmerman reports the handbook lists several student organizations and how to 
get in touch with the student leaders. 

According to Zimmerman, however, word of mouth is the best advertisement for 
student organizations "The best thing to do is just ask somebody." said Zinuncrman. 
Calling die student government office and die individual departments for informa- 
tion was also suggested by Zimmerman. 

Perchan contends, though, students more often than not 
have to make die first move, but reports his depan- 
t will make the first step as easy as possi- 
ble. 

"We'll make them fe«l cranfoit- 
able when taking the step." said 
Perchan. 

A wellness program. 

inuamural and intercollegiate 

teams are all offered by the athletic 

department, according to Perchan, He also reports 

die department suU has job openings for clerical help, game 

commentaiors. and suUsiics help. 

Perchan reports students who are sport nuls, but not athletic, may want to join a 
team as a studeni assistant or manager 

All a student needs to do is call die adiletics office if Ibey are in the least bit inter- 
ested in any activities the department offers, said Perchan.

Monday afternoon the SAS, which links the entire 
campus' computers, crashed for die first time since its 
installation in March 

"Tlie SAS IS a really large integrated system, mean- 
ing everything connects." said Mary Schocler. manager 
of payer services, "We are so fortunate this did not 
happen last week dunng one of the main registrations 
and payment deadlines." 

According to Schocler, the Computing and Data 
Processing Department worked all of Monday night to 
identify die corrupt transaction file which crashed the 
system but was not successful, 

"The problem for us is wc were not able to detect 
the source of die corrupt file, so this could happen 
again." said Sehoeler 

ilie system was not restored untU Tuesday after- 
noon, however, every department consequendy lost die 
d;iia entered on Monday and vcK forced to reven to 



the paper records and reenter the information, said 
Schocler 

Mark Franke, assistant comptroller of the bursar's 
office, said although the sysiem crash was inconve- 
nient for some students, once the system was returned 
students hardly had to wait. 

"If we would have been down most of the day die I 
first week of last year, we would have been lynched." 
said Franke. "It would have been a mghtmare," 

Franke reports with the previous system the aver- 
age window service times in the Bursar's office were 
five to twelve minutes. The new system is averaging 
two minutes. 

Director of Financial Aid Bob Zellers reports the 
system is a needed improvement, but said it takes time 
to lest and modify all of the program's needs for his 
office to run smoothly 

"We had a great deal of work to do in a limned 
amount of time to do it ia" said Zellers. 

Zellers reports, however, the new electronic transfer 
of funds option for loan reapients has nothing to do 




with the slowdown caused by integrating die 



"It is not the ETT process at all Ii is working very 
well We arc doing the best we can." said Zellers, 

Dodi Zellers and Franke bodi firmly believe the sec- 
ond semester will run more smoothly 

"By spnng semester it will be running so smoodi, 
people will have forgotten they ever waited in line," 
said l-ranke.

Asia offers alternatives to exchange program 



by S. Brant Kelky 
Start Reporter 

The perfeci lime (o travel abroad for a 
year or lo do something unusual for an 
extended period of lime, longer than two 
weeks, Ls while Iheic arc no pre.v;ing com- 
mitments in college 

For those who don't have adequate 
grasp of a foreign language, cannot spend 
the S5,000 plus for a semester or SIO.OIX) 
plus for a year abroad, or just want a year 
away from ihe ngors of academics, there is 
an alternative to the typical college foreign 
exchange program. 

For Uic person who wi&amp;hes lo immerse 
himself or herself m another culture for a 
year, he or she can teach the English lan- 
guage in South Korea after receiving his or 



her four-year degree People who reach 
operate under the auspices of a number of 
businesses which sell only language 
instruction One such corporation is the 
Bok Ji Corporation, Such businesses are 
called institutes and they are paid by 
clients on a monthly basis for their ser- 
vices. 

Instructors will teach classes ranging 
from two to 12 studcnLs. usually five hours 
a day. five days per week. TexLs are typi- 
cally provided, but imagination is encour- 
aged withm the clas.sroom. 

AH instruaors should maintain a busi- 
ness-type relatinsbip with his or ber stu- 
dents rather than a teacher-pupil relation- 
ship. In that vein, the mstrucior's work 
year is not like a school year, so be or she 
will not receive a summer or winter vaca- 



tion, but will gel Korean holidays off. 

The instructor answers lo nobody 
directly, so he or she has some freedom in 
runnmg the classroom. 

Teachers are treated differently in 
Korea than in the US Most Koreans 
admire teachers and consider the profes- 
sion an honorable one. Teachers may even 
find tokens of appreciation given by the 
students as a sign of their gratitude, 

A year-long stay in any country can be 
a daunting hurdle Most insiruclors stay 
with Korean families for Ihe year. This 
requires the ability to demonsiraie some 
quid pro quo with the hosts, as sometimes 
a bathroom or other home facilities may 
need to be shared. In any case, the decision 
will be made in conjunction with the 
instructor's director 



Asian diets are unlike American and 
Korean cuisine is no exception. The 
Koreans eat a lot of rice and use a loi of 
spice It is also reasonably priced. 
American food is available, but il is more 
expensive: a meal at McDonald's costs 
twice there what it docs here 

Most Americans get along well with the 
Korean people. They are fairly reserved, 
but mleresied in learning more about 
Americans, A point about teacher- student 
culture: if you socialize with your students, 
they may want to pay for your meal, but 
you must insist (o pay when your turn 
comes around. 

Many Koreans enjoy mountain climb- 
ing, and there is no shortage of mountains 
on the entire Korean peninsula Coffee 
shops arc also plentiful and anyone inter- 



ested in manial arts can take lessons ai ibe 
birthplace of Tai Kwon Do, Koreans also 
enjoy dancing, but entering a nightclub is 
expensi\-e. 

For tho.se who would want to hear an 
English voice occasionally, the miUiary 
operates an English-speaking television 
station called AFKN. on channel 2. 

English instniction is a steady form of 
employment for people whose native lan- 
guage is English because everyone in 
Korea wants to learn the language There 
are several ways to find employment as an 
English instnicior in South Korea, hui the 
easiest is to contact a placemenl agency 
such as the Bok Ji Corporation. Bok li 
itself places about 50 instructors a month 
in institutes 




by Jeimifer Zarlnun 
Chief Reporter 

For a woman whose top priority is encouraging 
writing across the curriculum, taking the position of 
English department chair seems only natural. 

Mary Helen Thuenle. who has taught English at 
IPFW since 1974, is excited to hold the position. 

"I was inienm chair last year and I really enjoyed 
il." Thuenle said, "so I'm really looking forward to 
being there permancndy." 

"I bad my doubts about the 
amount of time that I would spend 
teaching, but I find this rewarding 
and challenging," Thuente said. 

Thuenle earned her Ph,D, at the 
Univcrsily of Kansas in 1973. She 
is currently a fuL time professor of 
EngUsh at IPFW and has also been 
the ducctor of graduaics in liberal 
studies. 

As an expert in the area of Irish 
liieraiure and culture. Thuente has 
been the past president of the 
American Conference for Irish 
Studies. 

Thuenle is also an author, with 
her most recently published book 
entitled "The Harp Re-slrung; The 
United Irishmen and the Rise of 
Irish Literary Nationalism." The 
book, which was wnlten in 1994, 
was published by Syracuse 
University Press. 

"This position was the logical 
next step in my career." Thuenle 
said. "I letl that 1 can offer leader- 



ship to the department as well." 

Pursuing student imercsi across the curriculum is a 
high pnoriiy for Thuenle. who feels that encouraging 
writing should be a mission for all teachers in ail 
departments. 

"I think that I can have a greater impact on the sJiap- 
mg of the department." Thuenle said, "and ! feel that I 
have a lot to contribute lo IPFW."

With (be departure of Mark 
GiaQuinia Trom ihe 5lh Districi 
Council race. Jordan Lebamoff has 
been caJled on by the Democralic 
Pany lo be its candidate He will be 
running against Republican nomi- 
nee. Diedre Hall 

Lebamoff ^d he believes peo- 
ple should work with government 
to govern ibemselves, "I hope to 
spur some activism, especially 
among younger people," Lebamoff 
said He compared the voting num- 



bers for ibe older generation with 
the younger generation. 

" Historically, older voters have 
had higher turnout," he said. 
According to statistics compiled by 
the Allen County Voter 
Registration Board, only 14,079 
people from 18 to 24 years vote 
compared to 27,621 voters in the 45 
to 54 age group. 

One of the many points 
Lebamoff spoke about was small 
neighborhood parks and neighbor- 
hood improvements Lebamoff 
mentioned revitalizing Packard 
park and installing one way signs 
on Hoagland Avenue as improve- 
menLs needed in the area. "We need 
a cohesive, kinetic community." 
Lebamoff said, 

Lebamoff is no stranger to the 



5lh Distnct or the political arena, "i 
want to be a good candidate, but 
you can't be a good candidate with 
out knowing what the people want. 
Not knowing would be foolish " 
Lebamoff said 

Lebamoff is the son of storied 
Fort Wayne mayor Ivan Lebamoff 
Lebamoff said his father's experi- 
ence influenced him in many ways 
"I learned from my parents the 
value of being involved in my 
neighborhood." said Lebamoff. 

Lebamoff has relumed to Fori 
Wayne after several years traveling 
around the country and the world. 
"I chose to come back to Fort 
Wayne; 1 grew up here; I'm a fifth 
district child," He said. "Fort

Packwood must pay 



Sen Rnbcn Packwood &lt;R) has 
been a naugtiiy boy. and nobody 
seems to care. Thai's what we. Ibc 
Amencan public, arc led lo believe 
since ii has been decided that 
charges of his sexual misconduci 
do not warrani a public beating. 
This is the same group of elected 
Republicans who fell it was neces- 
sary lo hold hearings on a pnvaic 
investmeni deal gone wrong made 
by a DcmfKiai and his wife. This 
is a prime example of what is lypt- 
cally known as a double standard . 

Senator Packwood has publicly 
wondered why the twenty ladies 
making these allegations have not 
stepped forward sooner Remember 
back to four years ago when Anita 
Hill stepped forward with her aJle- 
galions that then Supreme Court 
Justice nominee Clarance Thomas 
had sexually harassed her when she 
worked for him. The Republicans 
dragged Hill through the mud. Yet 
few gave her credit for keeping her 
semblance of grace during the 
whole onjeal This sends a message 
lo our women that if you feel thai 
you have been violated then pre- 
pare to be chastised extensively 
Women of all ages today are still 
being told who they can be and to 
speak only when spoken to. 

But for those who are surjwised 
with the lack of willingness by the 
Republican Party in the Packwood 
case, don't be On the verge of a 
new century, women still have to 
figbl for equal justice, and they are 
losing. Women make only seventy- 
two cents to the white man's dollar. 
Women make up fitly-two percent 
of the American population, yet 



bold only two percent of the seats 
in either government house So it ls 
not fair to say thai the Republicans 
are keeping women down, hut men 
of all types. 

What is particularly disturbing 
in the Packwood case is his stand 
on the sexual acts he is accused of. 
While never really denying the alle- 
gations, he feels that since these 
incidents happened fifteen or more 
years ago, then be should noi be 
held accouniable. This is as if to 
say that since it was not politically 
concci in the seventies to respect 
women, then he did no wrong 
What he is not considering is the 
unpact his wandering hands had on 
those females Being chased around 
the office, righting off your boss 
who wanLs you lo use your short 
hand on hts sensitive areas is not an 
easy thing to shake off, Packwood 
put these women in unnecessary 
offensive situations and be must 
now answer for his crimes 

If Packwood is deemed guilty of 
these allegations, then it will indeed 
be a big victory for women of 
America, bui it will not solve all of 
the problems with sexual equality 
But what will? Women voting in 
more elections' More women run- 
ning for office? Maybe. But the 
first step is to definitely slap the 
hands of the men who think that 
women are here on Earth to serve 
them. 

To deny the public the chance to 
witness the trial of a wrong that 
haunts women everywhere, would 
be just that, wrong. Maybe men 
would see the barm sexual harass- 
ment can cauK.

Letter to the Editor 



Liddy undeserving of award 



To the Editor 

In the Orwellian par- 
lance of contempory corpo- 
rate media, criticism of 
reactionaries has come to be 
equated with censorship. 

The National 

Association of Radio Talk 
Show Hosts (NARTSH) 
applied this curious eijua- 
lion when it recently gave 
G. Gordon Liddy its 
"Freedom of Speech" 
award. 

Liddy repetitively criti- 
cizes that which he doesn't 
like each weekday on 
roughly 250 radio stations, 
through a highly restrictive 
format in which callers who 
disagree with Liddy's ideol- 
ogy rarely— extremely 
rarely— get past the call 
screener. His show primari- 



ly consists of Liddy's 
monologues, interspersed 
with affirmations of 
Liddy's views by ideologi- 
cally accepuble callers, and 
through the ideologically 
acceptable faxes that Liddy 
selects to read to his listen- 
ers. 

In response to his widely 
broadcast instructions on 
how to make bombs, the 
most effective ways to kill 
federal officers, his boasts 
about using images labeled 
"Dill" and "Hillary" for 
shooting practice targets 
and other Liddyisms, Liddy 
has received criticism from 
various journalists, police 
officers, and President 
Clinton and a lot of nega- 
tive public opinion, but he 
has suffered no official 



threat to his First 
Amendment righus. 

What makes the 
NARTSH accolade doubly 
ironic is Liddy's own 
exueme hostility toward the 
free speech of those who 
disagree with him. On the 
June 13, 1991 television 
broadcast of CNBC's pro- 
gram "The Real Story," 
Liddy appeared with 
columnist Jack Anderson 
During their televised dis- 
cussion, Liddy admitted 
that when he worked for 
President Nixon, he started 
a plan to kill Anderson, 
who was a critic of Nixon's 
administration. Liddy 
explained to Anderson that 
"The rationale was to come 
up with a method of silenc- 



ing 1 



ih kil 



you. 

Liddy's murder plan was 
turned down by his .superi- 
ors within Nixon's adminis- 
tration, but the fact that he 
conceived of and was seri- 
ously willing to silence 
speech through murder 
speaks volumes about the 
fraud perpetrated by 
NARTSH NARTSH 

claims its award recognizes 
"the individual who best 
embodies and boldly 
defends those freedoms 
guaranteed by the First 
Amendment." 

Based on its latest 
choice, 1 wonder who 
NARTSH will pick next 
year as a defender of free 
speech. Perhaps NARTSH 
could posthumously award 
Adolph Hitler for protecting 



Nazi monologues from the 
potentially critical com- 
ments of Jews, Slavs, 
Gypsies, homosexuals, dis- 
abled people and political 
dissidents? Or Joseph 
Stalin, for protecting 
Stalinist propaganda from 
the potentially less than 
favorable reviews of the 
millions he also murdered, 
and the millions he also 
held in ihrall through means 
that included the monopo- 
lization of mass media. 

In terms of sheer body 
counLs, both of these guys 
far surpassed Liddy as pro- 
tectors of authontarian pro- 
paganda from contrary 
opinion.

boyfriends leave the bouse for the 
day. The video even has a guest 
appearance by overrated stud Fahio. 
And if you listen to B106, you may 
have caught the song on the air 
waves. All of 
this mainstream 
exposure is 
great and is 
what gays have 
been wanting 
all along, but 
there is a major 
problem. 
It 
involves a big 
retail store. K 
Mart, They 
have installed a 

, new machine 

that shows a 
snippet of a video of a song off a 
new release, with just a touch of a 




Paul 
Tupper 



button. The clip usually features the 
chorus of the .song because it Ls the 
most recognizable But in the case 
of "I Kissed a Girl," a part of the 
first verse is used, staying clear 
from the line "I Kissed a Girl," 
Even worse, near the button of the 
other songs, the anist and song tide 
is listed. Not so with Sobule's cLp. 
where it just says "Jill Sobule " 

There is a clear message here. K 
Man is willing to advertise the 
album on this new promotional 
gimmick, but they are not doing it 
equally as compared to the other 
titles They want you to buy the 
album, but without being exposed 
to it with the same push as any 
other album. 

To the credit of our local store, I 
called itK Cohseum K Man and ibe 
store manager was not aware of this 
blatant expression of homophobia. 



He did graciously give me the num- 
ber of the main offices where I 
await the call from the man who 
can answer as to why this has hap- 
pened,,. I'll keep you posted. 

Who is K Man trying to prolea? 
What they are saying is you can 
buy the controversial material at 
our store, but do so at your own dis- 
cretion because we do not suppon 
this artist's cause, which in this 
case happens to be equal lifestyle 
rigbLs, They want our money, but if 
the subject at hand is not within the 
norm of the family structure, then 
they will alter it so it does noi 
"influence" curious members. 

This is an old argument, "Our 
son Ls gay because you put a plant 
in bis room." I have heard this lime 
and time again,

Burn Faulkner at the stake 




Nol 
Beckley 



In Ihc history of Ihc Hniied 
Sutes. 'icveral people have broken 
hamerj, in areas previously closed 
off lo them, African- Americans in 
Liule Rock during the 1950s hrokc 
the color hairi- 
er Women's 
suffrage groups 
secured itieir 
right to vole in 
America. 
Recently. a 
woman has 
hccn allowed 
into one of 
America's pre- 
mier military 
schools, The 
Citadel. This 

institution has a 

rich and legendary history dating 
back to pre-Civil War days. 

Shannon Faulkner tried to 
change the traditions and system 
which has created many impressive 
soldiers for the United States. I 
have to question this woman's 
motives. Logic dictates she never 
was ready for the mental and physi- 
cal aspects of being a "knob." 

I-aulkner was treated with more 
respect by the cadets than any other 
group surrounding the whole fiasco 
They abused her just as harshly as 
any other "knob" on campus She 
received no .special treatment from 
them This is true equality. This is 
what Gloria Stienem and every 
woman from NOW desire 1 am 
sure Faulkner wanted to be treated 



the .same, until "hell week " No one 
asks to be abused like she was. but 
she made a decision to attend. 
Many other cadets made the same 
decision and several of them 
dropped out also Many more 
stayed and in four years will have 

"Faulkner was 
treated with more 
respect by the 
cadets than 
any other group 
surrounding the 
whole fiasco." 

earned the right lo wear the ring 
Faulkner had two years lo prepare 
herself for the rigors of training and 
she (ailed mLscrabty. both physical- 
ly and mentally. 

Faulkner attended The Citadel 
for the reason of promoting "wom- 
ankind," and for that treason she 
should be burnt at the stake. Her 
treason was committed against all 
the other graduates and students at 
the university. Does "womankind" 
need a crusader to get women into 
The Citadel? Aren't other military 
schools open to women? Many 
women attend Wesl Point and the 
Virginia Military Institution. She 
could have received an education at 
these inslilutions, but she had ulten- 
or motives. She or some other force 
wanted Shannon to be the "Saint 
Joan" of Tlie Citadel 

The men who have graduated 



wanted lo go the Citadel to prove lo 
themselves they were the finest 
specimens in the country. They 
gave all they could to become grad- 
uates and serve their country. To 
lower ihe requirements to allow an 
out of shape woman become a cadet 
is an affront to all legitimate gradu- 
ates of The Citadel. Wont a lower- 
ing of standards or a special sei of 
rules creaie more animosity than 
respect? When the first black man 
wenl to The Citadel in the 60s. the 
institution did not lower its stan- 
dards lo accommodate him. A bet- 
ter guess was they were tougher on 
him. He was a "nigger" going to a 
historically white school in the mid- 
dle of "blue-blood" Charleston, 
S.C, He may have been considered 
a "nigger," but he did the job with 
no preferential ireatmeni. Even if 
you were racist then, bis courage 
and determination had to be 
admired. Incidentally, ihe first 
black man admitted lo The Citadel 
also was the first black man to grad- 
uate from The Citadel 

Faulkner never was respaied Ihc 
same way the black man was (even 
if it was grudgingly given). She had 
her own special rules. She did not 
stay in or near the banacks. She 
could not take her oath to the coun- I 
try and constituuon because of heat 
exhaustion. I only have one thing to 
say to her, "It's a man's world, 
babe. Get used toil" 



K Mart from page 4 - 
n K Mart thinks that they are help- 
ing lo control the gay population, I 
am here to tell them that avoiding 
Ihe gay theme is not gomg to do it. 
Jill Sobule wrote a catchy Utile 
song about a very real situation, Nol 



against homosexuals, but ihey are 
censoring Miss Sobule's an, 

I am not sure if the higher-ups at 
K Man thought that no one would 
notice or care, or even if they have 
informed Jill Sobule or her record 



only is K Man discriminating company about their marketing 



techniques, Whal they have done is 
sent an understood message that tell 
gays and their supporters to shop 
elsewhere. 

Darn! 1 guess that means no 
more Jacqueline Smith clothing.

Penetrating thoughts.. 



SEX. This is a lopic ihii comes up 
in conversation a lol. especially in 
today's society Bui why does this 
word and its meaning have such 
divert effects on people? 

Some people feel Ihe same way 
that George Michael feels; "Sex is 
natural, sex is good, not everybody 
does it, but everybody should." 
That's okay with me that people arc 
so open and willing lo partake in this 
activity as long as it does noi include 
me, at this point in my life. 

I ihink if you have found the right 
person and you know you are ready 
to make this commitment (and it is a 
commitment for all you oui there who 



think il is jusi somcitung to do) ihan it 
is okay. But it is important to remem- 
ber ihat ihere are ihosc of us who are 
still weanng Ihe chastity bell and plan 
lo remain ihai way uniil Mr. or Mrs. 
Right comes along. And it is equally 
important lo remember thai it is okay 
10 be, dare I say, a virgin. 

Bui Ihe fad of the mailer is ihai ii 
is 1995, and when one flips on MTV, 
the evening news or reads (he morn- 
ing paper, one can always find some- 
thing ahoui sex. Whether ii's some- 
one preaching safe sex, or AIDS 
awareness infomercials or practicing 
abstinence information, the topic of 
sex is everywhere. And il seems to 




'^Let us endeavor to live that when 
we come to die even the undertaker 
will be sorry" 

- Mark Twain 

At the Dasli-ln Cafe, we have two interpretations of 

Mr. Twain's comment. 

One interpretation is that TWain means we should lead a 
life of such good cheer and kindness toward others that 
when we do expire, even those who lake a professional 
interest in our passing will also feel a sense of grief. 
The other view is ihat we should throw ourselves into life 
with such bacchanalian zeal ihat all we leave behind is a 
corpse so ravaged by caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol that 
when It comes time for Ihe mortician to make the first 
incision he will, upon seeing our insidcs, scream like an 
eight-year old sissy and fall into a dead faint. 
Whichever view you prefer, the Dash-In Cafe has the good 
cheer, the smokes, the espresso and cappuccino drinks, and 
the micro-brewed beers you need lo rum a mortician's day

Affording the bills: College Jobs 



hy Jmcl M. Tobey 
Fulurc* Editor 

You have decided. You are com- 
milled lo pulling your education 
fusi 

You realize ihal wbiJc irying lo 
juggle a full class schedule, along 
wtlh study lime, you may have 
fewer than 40 liours a week avail- 




able lo work. And ihai quasi-real 
job you liad, or iboughi you migbt 
apply for. has been sacrificed in the 
quest for education 

Welcome to the world of the 
poor college sludeni. 
Or, maybe noL 

IPFW siudenLs live in the real 
world, where balancing rent, car 
paymenLs, and an A in algebra is a 
constant struggle. 
The problem of 
making a living 
while making the 
grade is often the 
toughest part of 
pursuing a degree 

The problem is 
thai most pan-time 
jobs pay not much 
more than mini- 
mum wage. 
Multiply 20 hours 
a week limes five 
dollars an hour, 
and you get a very 
small hilt of beans. 
And that is before 
tares. For those of 
us who have to Pay 
the Bills, such a 
paycheck is not an 
option. 

So what do you 
do? Drop your 



class hours to minimal so you can 
work more hours? No! 

The challenge is to find a college 
job Ihal is easily worked around 
your class schedule (if school is 
indeed your priorily) and will still 
Pay the Bills, 

Here are some suggestions: 

The Restaurant Business; 
RestauranLs can be a haven for col- 
lege students who want to earn 
good money hourly. Find the right 
place to eam your tips and you can 
make more than SIO an hour, even 

Fori Wayne 

Expect the work to be intense 
and rushed at limes, that is the 
nature of the business 

Bartenders often m^e the most 
per hour, but be warned that the 
ofien late hours (and afier-hours 
sampling of the wares) can interfere 
with your class attendance. Overall, 
though, working in a restaurant can 
be a good way to Pay the Bills dur- 
ing college 

Your first up: Stick to the more 
expensive restaurants where the 
nice people will appreciate your 
academic efforts and leave you 
juicy gratuities. 

Sales: If you like sales, you are 



lucky, because you probably can 
find plenty of pan-iime jobs thai 
pay pretty well Telemarketing 
positions abound for the aggressive 
salesperson. 

For those who tiate phone sales, 
door-to-door, and such, there are 
odier sales jobs that can cam good 
cash. 

Working in a retail store, you 
probably will make only around S6 
an hour unless you have a commis- 
sion sales position People working 
in these plum positions often eam 
twice as much per hour as a non- 
commission salesperson. 

Common areas for commission 
sales arc cosmetics, fragrance. 
men's suiLs, furniture, and electron- 
ics, depending upon the department 
store. 

Tip: Find one with a base pay 
plus commission, or you may be 
disappointed. 

Health Care: This is a growing 
field, and one in which you can 
make good money. 

If what you are looking for is a 
college job, not a career, you can 
still make a good paycheck with 
only aliiUe training. 

An added t)enefit is that this field 
IS fulfilling, and you might want to 
Slick with it! 



You might also consider invest- 



Roadblocks to Financial Aid 



Either way. you can lest the 
waters hy working as a nursing 
assistant or a home health aide 
Once you are certified and have 
some expenence. you can hire on 
with an agency Working through 
an agency allows you essenUally to 
make your own schedule and to 
eam S8 lo SIO an hour. 

Not a bad college job, even if 
you are pursuing an unrelated 
degree 

Temp. Agency: You may find a 
job that pays well hourly through a 
temp, agency if you have a skill lo 
offer, like secretarial or industrial 
skill. 

The main benefits of these jobs 
are that they are flexible, and that 
they may lead to somcUung penna- 
nent. 

Some of ihcse jobs, you 
wouldn't want to be permanent. 
Unskilled lab«- jobs can be a night- 
mare. 

But if you can type like a speed- 
demon, take dictation, or run a 
forklifi. a temp, agency might be a 
good place lo check into. 

These are only a few sugges- 
tions, some alternatives to working 
for minimum wage. 

By all means, if you have the 
chance to work in something relat- 
ed to your field, do so, even if the 
pay is not so great- it wiU pay off diploma Meanwhile, you decide: 
later. For now, you may need to how valuable is your lime? 
combine options lo obtain a job-sil- 
uation that works for you.

it is only a college job. Let' s face it.

Fresb off a spnng lour opening for Adam Ant, EMI recording arlisUi 
The Dweller;, invaded Fon Wayne on Augpst 4 in suppon of ibeir debul 
CD "Whatever Makes You Happy ' 

Frontman and iongwriler Johnny Adriani creates an interesung and 
somewhai infectious powa-pop sound The Dwellers arc lyrically similar 
10 Soul Asylum and Urge Overkill, but their music has an early Bon Jovi 
pop sound. Unfonunaiely. (beu melodies are nearly all ihe same. Adnani's 
voice rises and falls during (he same point in almost every song. The 
Dwellers do have a good sound and feel, but the songs run together 
Hopefully in their next CD they can vary (heir melodies and make the CD 
whole. 

There are high poinu to this CD The first release. "Rocket Ride" has 
[be same upbeat, jovial qualities as a Bon Jovi power ballad, but with 
lyrics which would put the two dimensional Jon Bon Jovi to shame. Other 
high points include the lyrics to ""Happy Oouds" and "Thanks to Sara." 
"New Fashion Show," the fir^t cut, is the stronge,st on "Whatever Makes 
You Happy." 

Tbe Dwellers have made a decent first effon and ihey leave me curious 
about their next release Possibly we may be bearing some decent things 



by PaulTuppcr 
Managing Editor 

I remember when I was in middle school, paying little attention lo the 
teacher, writing the words on my notebook to 'Time After Time." This 
was one of those songs thai I wished I had written. This feeling still holds 
true today. 

This marked the beginning of an enigmatic relationship I internally 
have with Cyndi Laupcr In the mid-eighties, she brought fun to the word 
"freak " Those of us who felt different now were able to have a sense of 

'""$i.oobir"' 

any regular 6" 
Sub Sandwich 



humor about ourselves 

"Twelve Deadly Cyns. and then some" is not just a hiLs coUcciion, but 
a reminder of those aloof times The songs range from Laupcr' s begin- 
nings with the band Blue Angel ("I'm Gonna Be Strong") to her best cuts 
from her last album "Hal Full Of Stars " There is, of course, the obligatory 
two new songs that now accommodate every "best of album, but the dif- 
ference here is thai one is a reggae remake of her fint hit "Girls Just Want 
To Have Fun." 

Lauper's career has stalled not because of the quaUty of her work, but 
because she waits four years between projects, so every album is deemed a 
comeback album The body of work on "Cyns" is so thai criucs will sec 
she has been consistent with disDnclion through every aspect of her cancr. 
Her only true crime is maturing But at 44. isn't that expected? 

The collection includes all of the big hiLs. wisely skipping the meaning- 
less soundtrack contnbuiions she has made. Of her earlier works, "She 
Bop" is a stand out for is frankness about fcm^e masturbation and it's 
pure groove. Of the later material, "Sally's Pigeons" is by far Lauper at her 
best. 

Cyndi Lauper has itcver been known for her vocal abilities, and that's a 
shame because she has the voice every white woman dreams She can 
whi.sper, hit the high notes, belt, and accentuate each breath with the best 
vocalist. Need proof? Listen again to "I Drove All Night" and "True 
Colors" again and you will hear her dynamics.

EdIlor-ln-Cblcr 

Recognized in some circles as the 
"most widely seen, best known and — 
arguably — be.sl loved motion picture in 
history." the "Wizard of Or" has become a 
rixiure of American history Capitalizing 
on Lhis love (or O/.. Turner Entertainment 
released a two CD set m July of 1995 The 
two disc set contains every note from the 
wondrous movie, but what makes this set 
especially interesting are the demos and 
outiakes contained on the second disc 




the 56 years since "Wizard" was released. 
The remastered version truly brings out 



Garland's vocal clarity as vinyl never 
could. The set includes all of the musical 
numbers from the movie Included are 
"Over the Rainbow," the Muchkin Musical 
Sequence. '"If I Only Had A Brain" and 
"We're Off To See The Wizard," among 
others Songs which ended up on the cut- 
ting room floor also appear in their enliie- 

ty 

One of the most entertaining features of 
the set is a 52 page booklet deiaihng every

Performing Arts. McCants is also a professor of 



Faculty 
shares 
variety 
of talent 

by Jennifer Zarlman 
Chief Reporter 

The IPFW music department 
will he starting out the year on a 
high note - hterally. 

The music department has 
scheduled a faculty concert for 
7:30 p m. on Sunday at the Neff 
Recital Hall. 

"Several faculty and associates 
will be performing alone or in 
groups," said department publicist 
Christina Kulow. 

"The department's newest fac- 
ulty member, Rebecca 
McConnaughey. and associau pro- 
fessor of " music, Masson 
Robertson, will be showcased that 
evening," Kulow said 

McConnaughey. visiting assis- 
tant professor of music, will be 
vocalist and will be accompanied 
by Robertson on die piano 

"We will also have others per- 
forming in the concert, but 
Rebecca's performance will be the 
highlight." Kulow said, "because 
this is the first time that she will be 
performing as an IPFW faculty 
member 

"It's hard to say highlight, 
though," Kulow said, "but her per- 
formance will definitely be 
unique," 

The concert will also feature 
performances by Joyanne Outland, 
Marcella Treniacosti. Ann L. 
Conner. Cynthia Greider and 
Michael TrentacosU. 

"All of the performances will 
be excellent," Kulow said. 

The concert will be the kickoff 
for the faculty artist series, 

"There an; three different kinds 
of concerts that we offer." Kulow 
said. "We have faculty concerts, 
major ensembles and minor 
ensembles," she said. 

Minor ensembles generally fea- 
ture quartets and percussion 
groups, while major ensembles 
offer larger preseniatiODs. such as 
multi-piece orchestras. Kulow 
added 

"Laler. in November, we are 
planning to have our 'November 
Harvest of Harmony' concert," 
Kulow said, "but there will be 
more information about that avail- 
able later." 

Anyone interested in further 
information about ihis or any other 
IPFW concert may contact the 
department of music at (219) 481- 
6714. 

Tickets can be purchased at the 
office, located in the Classroom 
Medical Building Room 19, or at 
the door 

"But they are jusi as easy to 
purchase at the door." Kulow

vic£ chancellor for 
academic affairs He is succeeding (jcrald Lee 
Ratliff. who accepted a position as E)ean of ibe 
School of Ans at Montana State University 

Plannmg and time are unponant concerns for 
McCaiiLs. "I would be an acuve, not a caretaker 
dean. I would addres.&lt;^ major and long term con- 
siderations, not just minor and short term ones. 
even though my tenure would be short . I would 
focus upon school, not department, needs and 
issues." McCants said during the School of Fme 
and Performing Arts Faculty Retreat 

A meeting with the department chairs five 
days after McCanu' appointment provided him 
with a few issues to empbasi/e Among these 
issues were general education, rccruiimenl and 
retention, faculty development, and faculty moQ- 
vation. 

McCants is originally from Petersburg. Va. In 
1958 he earned a bachelor's degree in EngUsh. 
speech, and drama from the University of 
Richmond. His master's, earned in 1959. and bis 



doctorate were both earned from Northwestern 
University. 

IPFW added McCants lo iLs faculty in 1968 
and be became a full professor in 1981. From 
1970 to 1988, McCanLs chaired the Department 
of Communication and Theatre. He was appoint- 
ed interim vice chancellor for acadeuuc affairs 
from 1991 to 1993. 

McCants is active in the Fori Wayne commu- 
niiy as well as IPFW He was president of the 
board of directors for the Fori Wayne Civic 
Theater and also a member of the Fori Wayne 
Community of Arts Council He has member- 
ships with the Speech Communication 
AssociaUon, Cenira) States Speech Association 
and Indiana Speech Association 

He is a charier member of the Religious 
Speech Communication Association. The 
Amencan Theater Associauon and the Indiana 
Theatre Association have both benefited from his 
membership also

NFL Preview 

Niners, Fish-Super Bowl XXX? 



Thursday, August 24. 1995

Sport) Editor 

As ftunimer slowly slips 3way 
and fall genrly peaks her head 
around [be comer, another Nauonal 
Football League season ts dawning. 
Unlike (he troubles (hat have 
plagued (heir coun(erpart.s, the NFL 
faces no labor disagrccmenis, no 
impending playcn strike or owners 
lockouts It's time lo grab a bag of 
chips and a favorite beverage, kick 
back in tbc easy chair and play 
'■ Armchair Quarterback." Like any 
good second-guessing axmchair ath- 
lete, tbc time has come to forecast 
the winners and losers To predict 
the outcome of this 17 week war 
called the NFI- season. Starting on 
the East coa.s( with (he National 
Football Conference, and moving 
westward examining each division 
with in the NFC and the Almost 
Football Conference, 

NFC EAST 
Tbe obvious pick here is the 
Cowboys who return much of the 
team that fought tooth and nail with 
San Francisco last season. 
However, "America's Team" has 
taken some big hits on both sides of 
the ball Gone are a number of for- 
mer Cowboy standouts; neverthe- 
less, the Cowboys are stilt too 
strong for any of the o(her (earns in 
(he Eas(. Possibly (he only team that 
could give Dallas a fight hails from 
the Philadelphia A new coaching 
staff and a healthy Randall 
Cunningham could spell trouble for 
a number of teams in '95 However, 
the Eagles slill don't have the per- 
sonnel to soar past Dallas 
NFC CENTRAL 
While defending divisional 
champion Minnesota has struggled 
in the preseason, the bngbt spot for 
the Vikings is at the quarterback 
position Warren Moon appears to 
be healthy after sustaining a painful 
arm injury last season. By all indi- 
cations. Moon's arm is healthy and 



the Viking pa&amp;sing game is ranng to 
fire. The question this season for 
the Vikings will be the running 
game and whether the running 
back.s can mature quickly enough to 
compliment Moon and the passing 
game Green Bay could surprise a 
lot of people, besides Packer fans, 
by turning in another playoff berth 
type season for die checsebcads in 
Wisconsin. Sadly, the Chicago 
Bears don't appear as though they 
have grasped the ideas of third year 
head coach Dave Wonnsteadl 
Although the Bears did make a 
valiant shot at improving upon last 
year's dismal showing from the 
running game by drafting Heismann 
Trophy winner Rashad Salaam, a 
rookie does not a running back 
make. Look for another so so show- 
ing by the "Monsters of the 
Midway." 

NFC WEST 
Home to ihe defending Super 
Bowl Champions, the NFC West 
appears to he the least competitive 
division in the NFC again this sea- 
son. Though the league somehow 
decided lo place expansion team 
Carolina in the west, who made that 
decision? The Niners need not fear 
a team within their division. Look 
for the team that epitomized the 
■80's to once again make a huge 
impression upon a number of teams 
in tbe league. 

AFC EAST 
Colts fans unite! It was a Joke, 
settle down Though (he home state 
eleven look much improved over 
last year, it didn't take much. The 
Colts appear to be a middle-of-the- 
road team once again. However, 
bold on lo your bat^ Indy fans, this 
may be the year that the Colts actu- 
ally make a trip to the playotTs and 
not just to sit and watch from the 
sidelines. The secret this year for 
the Colts will be the play of second 
year man Marshall Faulk. As 
Marshall runs, so goes the Colls 
season. The team that will reside at 



the lop among AFC East teams will 
be (he Miami Dolphins, Tbe 
"Florida Fish" have no( been 
impressive a( all in ihe warm-up 
season, but look to turn things 180 
degrees in the winning direction 
when they start playing for real. 
Don Shula has even been rumored 
to be courting the diamond in the 
rough, "Neon" Dion "Prime Time" 
Sanders llie Dolphins aheady look 
10 be a formidable opponent for any 
of the league's 32 teams, the addi- 
tion of the league's premier defen- 
sive back and show off could only 
solidify Miami's force. Look for 
Shula and the 'Fins to be there at 
the end of the season. 

AFC CENTRAL 
A real dogfight could make the 
AFC eastern conference the most 
entertaining division in all of fool- 
ball. At Cleveland, the Browns are 
looking like the "Dogs of old as 
they knock heads with the best of 
them in the preseason. Vinny 
Testraverde, although slow, appears 
to have regained control of his 
magic and the Browns defense is 
packing a fierce bite to accompany 
the loud barks from the pound. Any 
doubting Thomas need only look as 
far as the recent Cleveland victory 
over a pitiful Bears squad two 
weeks ago. Need more be said l"he 
Steelers haven't forgotten about Uie 
humiliating lo.se ui (he playoffs last 
year to San Diego. Hometown hero 
Rod Woodson, a perennial All-Pro. 
will surface once again as one of 
the league's best defensive backs.

In tlie Ijocker R.oora... 




by Jim Porter 

Sports Ed iiM" 

As a proressional baskeibati 
player. Bennk Lewis saw being an 
ainba.s&lt;.ador as pan of his job, As 
ibc new ilireclPr of promouons and 
fund raLsing for ibe aihlcuc depan- 
mcni, Lewis views his job in much 
the same lenns. 

"Il's all about people no maKer 
where you are," said Lewis. 

Today Lewis resides in Fori 
Wayne, but for 15 years, Australia 
was home. For 15 years Lewis 
roamed the outback and uaveled 
the Southern Hemisphere playing 
tbcgame of basketball. 

"It was a wonderful enperience 
lo have the opportunity to meet 
such a diversity of people It would 
have been a waste of the opportuni- 
ty if I woold have just played bas- 
ketball, 1 learned a lot about myself, 
about business and about people, it 
gave me an aliemaiive view point 
(0 a lot of things Australia is quite 
a mulicultmal society Idon'lthink 
that a lot of people know thai, but 
that's probably because il's not 
heavily advertised There are no 
ethnic, social or economic cliques, 
everybody is kiclcui' it with every- 
body." said Lewis, "1 would recom- 
mend it (experiencing life in the 
"Land Down Under") to everyone. 
It was easy to live there for 15 
years," be said. 

So what brought bim bade lo the 



United States and why IPFW in 
particular? 

"My motber-in-law hved in Fort 
Wayne so while we were living in 
Australia we'd visit every once in a 
while When I saw the job adver- 
tised I knew that it was right up my 
alley, but I wasn't sure if I could 
adjust," said Lewis 

As professionals, athletes often 
gel caught up in the here and now. 
The lunelight and the popularity is 
a food for their hunger. Then one 
day they get too old to compete at a 
level he has come to expect. 'ITien 
what happens'' 

For Lewis that time was a real 
eye-opener, but he had no doubts 
that be could meet the challenge 
head-on and conquer it. 

"Like all athletes when they 
retire they don't know what they 
are going to do Every man needs a 
purpose in life, a reason to gel up in 
the morning. That adrenaline drug 
is belter than any other drug Its 
hard to ctxne down off of thai high 
But when It's over it's like 'what 
now', "said Lewis. 

Though he has never taught one 
day of his life. Lewis credits his 
education with giving him the 
opportunities and confidence to 
move on. 

"With an education all kinds of 
jobs open up. Without an education 
it's a much bigger fall from the pro- 
fessional ranks," explained Lewis 
So. Lewis has brought his pro-

Women's V-Ball coach 
expects to take *next 
step,' *move forM^ard' 

by Jim Porter 
Sporb Fxlltor 



If nothing else. Ihe 1995 Lady 
■Dons should provide a dose of 
excitement for fans ihis season 
After winning the Greai Lakes 
Valley Conference tournament in 
each of the pasi two seasons, ihe 
team has set their sights on an even 
higher goal: advancing lo the 
NCAA Divisions II 

Championships. 

Since there is no automatic qual- 
ification for the championships, 
head coach Tim Heffron has 
worked diligently to give bLS 
the chance at impress- 
ing the selection ^^^ 
committee. The ^^B 
Lady 'Dons play six 
of ibe toughest match- 
es to start ibis year's 
campaign before finishing 
traditional conference power- 
houses Northern Kentucky, 
Lewis and Bellarrmne. 

Traditionally strong Ashland, 
a former GLVC foe, moved 
lo the GLIAC (Great Lakes" 
Intercollegiate Athletic 
Association) prior to this sea- 
son "The ftfsi month of the season 
and the final month are really 
important for us," said Heffron. 
"Typically ihe GLIAC is a much 
stronger conference so we have to 
beat them in non-conference play 
as well as winning in our own con- 
ference if we're going to go on to 
the [NCAAI tournament. Our goal 
this year is to fmish in the top three 
in Ihe region" 

With a nucleus of seasoned vet- 
erans, including All-Conference 
standoui Heather Teagarden, and a 
supporting cast of game-tested 
underclassmen, this year's learn has 
set its sights on attaining 
thai elusive "golden ring" of glory. 
Leading the leam will be senior 




outside hitter Teagarden Last sea- 
son Teagarden moved to third on 
the school's all-time career list for 
kills with 1180, just 98 kills from 
tying second place widi Julie Hubcr 
who fmished widi 1 278 career kills. 
The all-time leader for career kills 
is Clara Schortgen who tallied 1764 
kills from 1981 lo 1984 

"Heather doesn't bit the ball 
with a lot of power, but her 
placemen! makes her effective 
against anyone." commented 
Heffron, The unexpected loss of 
All-Conference middle hitter Dotbc 
Porch will make a big dent in 
"Dons offense and it's a 
poi that worries Heffron, 
though he is confident dial 
the team will step up lo 
meci the challenge 

"This team 

knows where they are 
and where tbey want to 
be 1 think that they 
think they are ready to 
take that next step and move 
on, " said Heffron That 
next step would be a his- 
tory-making trek for ihe 
IPFW women's volleyball 
team No other IPFW leami 
has advanced as far as the NCAA 
Women's Division Two 
Championships. In Heffron's mind 
Ihis team may be Ihe leam that 
rewrites history this year The 
chemistry of the squad is such dial 
elevating dieir play to another level 
may simply come naturally, accord- 
ing to Heffron Players such as 
junior Julie Parott and her "worka- 
holic altitude" coupled with Ami 
"Red" Reidenbach, as well as sea- 
soned batch of underclassmen, add 
to the excitemenL 

"Tbis group of girls know what 
they have to do to advance [to the 
NCAA tournament] and I believe 
Ihat tbey think tbey can and wdl do 
it," said Heffron.
