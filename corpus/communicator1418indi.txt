David M. Young, associate professor

Symptoms ol depression are:

Pros &amp; Cons of regulation 
NCAA rule needed medicine 



Under the National Collegiate Athletic Ass ocialion's 
new rules, which lake effect in 1986, freshman athletes 
entering Division 1 schools will be required to have 
scored 700 out o( 1600 on their Scholastic AptiludeTest 
(SAT1, or 15 composite on their American College 
Tests (ACTi and maintained a T average in English, 
math and science courses before playing a varsity 
■port. 

These rules have been praised and criticized. 

Most critics contend the rules arc biased toward 
whites. According to the Indiana Daily Student HDSi, 
in 1981 while students scored an average 9Z5 on the 
SAT while blackscores averaged 634. 

The IDS also reported that further research by the 
College Board, which administers the SATs, indicated 
students from more affluent socio-economic 
backgrounds recorded higher scores than low-income 

Although these criticisms are valid, the rules should 
still be enforced in 1986, 

Suppose an athlete played varsity basketball all four 
years of high school, was a consensus all-stale player 
in his junior and senior years and won an award equal 
lo that of Indiana's "Mr. Basketball." During his 
second week at a major university, he sat in class 
staring at an English skills test After five minutes, he 
began to shake with terror. Tears rolled down his 
eyes. He panicked, not knowing what to do because he 
could only read at the filth grade level. 

Hopefully, his suffering stopped there. However, 



history has shown there have been and probably still 
are coaches who care more about their teams winning 
the NCAA championship than their players getting a 
proper education If this athlete had such a coach, he 
would have gone four more years without improving 
his reading level. 

It is sad that situations like this one have happened 
and that some secondary educations in this country 
are lo blame. A student's mind, as well as his physical 
talent, should be developed to their fullest potential. 

Tf the NCAA's new rules are enforced, this problem 
may not happen. The rules may be biased, but the 
NCAA has to start somewhere. Perhaps the rules 
should judge students on their GPA and the type of 
curriculum followed during high school. To do well in 
college, one must work hard. A high GPA in a con- 
structive curriculum shows a student did indeed put 
forth an effort. 

Education officials should make sure a secondary- 
education in Fort Wayne is equal to one on the south 
side of Chicago. If the NCAA rules are enforced, Ihey 
could cause a chain reaction of high schools con- 
tinually trying to improve their curriculum and 
requirements to prepare all students for college. 

If colleges are forced lo take only those students 
who meet certain requirements, their variety or 
selection might be hurl. But the average atlitude of 
the players will be belter. Hard workers in the 
classroom will provide for an improved performance 
on the Held. 




Futile attempt to curb cheating 



■ the playing fields ; 



The National Collegiate Athletic Association, inan attempt 
to ensure that intercollegiate sports arc an extension ot the 
athletes' education, recently passed a regulation staling all 
incoming altikk-i in Division I schools must score at least a 
700 on (he SAT, maintain a Coverage in high school, and have 
taken such core classes as math, English and the social and 

The NCAA should be commended for Its inltlative. 
Ilowever. a student should not be penalized because the 
system of secondary education failed him. 

We don't want to sec college athletes become pro less iona Is 
who only carry books for looks. They should be In school lo 
earn a degree and get an education But the NCAA s new rule 
may discriminate against black athletes who, on the 
average, score lower on the SAT than whites, because of 
bull I- In biases. 

Regardless o( what many people think, most athletes are 
nol in college to hone (heir skills (or a possible pro career. 



They are in college lo get an education. 

Theproblem comes when akid Is told hecon't miss as o pro 
prospect and is led through school without ever learning lo 
read or write Whal happens when the kid is injuredand can 
no longer play, as was the ease with former IU basketball 
star London Turner? Where ore the people who were his 
friends? Probably they' re out lying to'someother kid. 

Despite his paralyzing injury. Turner is still in school at PU 
and should soon graduate. He realties his 6-10 body will 
never stand again, but he also knows the importance of a 
college education. 

No. the NCAA rule won't stop cheating If a coach badly 
wants a kid lo ploy, he'll find ways to doctor a transcript or 
have 5omeoneelse take the admissions tests. 

If the NCAA really wants to stop all cheating and make 
sure student athletes truly are student athletes. It should if a 
school is caught cheating- suspend the school's scholarships 
for four years; deny the school a share of conference 
revenues for four years; not allow the school lo hast any 
NCAA tournaments for at least four years; and refuse the 
school any television appearances for four yean.
