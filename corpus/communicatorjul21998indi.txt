University named 
in lawsuit 



By Gail Ruble-Crawford 

Editor 



Campus braces itself for a 
lough upcoming academic year 
as (he controversy surrounding 
recent faculty and administra- 
tive resignations continues. 

A lawsuit was filed on 
June 29 by Frost Illustrated 
against the university. 

The law- 




violated Indiana's Open Door 
Law and Access to Public 
Records AcL 

According to John Briggs, 
the Frost Illustrated writer who 
wrote the story, the informa- 
tion was first requested on 
June 4. 

Briggs asked Waller 
Branson, vice chancellor for 
Financial Affairs, for monetary 
figures about how much ii was 
cosiing the university to 
defend Chancellor Michael 
Wartell, Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Fenwick 
English and the university 
itself in several pending law- 
suits. 

The initial request for this 
information was denied by 
Branson, according to Briggs. 
Branson is also the Records 
Officer for the 
university. 

Frost Illustrated consult- 
ed wiih Stephen Key, General 
Counsel of Governmental 
Affairs for the Hoosier Press 
Association. 

Key is an expert on inter- 
pretation of Indiana's record 
access laws. 

Keys told Briggs and 
Frost Illustrated to re-word 
the request and re-submit it to 
the university. 

According to Briggs. (his 
was unnecessary. 

The request was denied a 
second time by Branson, said 
Briggs, who explained the rea- 
son initially given for the sec- 
ond denial was attorney-client 
privilege. 

According to Key's inter- 
pretation of the law. attorney- 
client privilege does not cover 
such payment information. 

On June 29, Branson sent a 
memo to Frost Illustrated in 



which he said that he had been 
reviewing the paper's request 
for public records, and had 
been partially mistaken in his 
initial denials, said Briggs. 

He said that he "had 
assumed that the information 
requested was covered by 
insurance," and. therefore, 
"not subject" lo Public Access 
Laws. 

He also wrote that he had 
not been able to comply with 
the request for monetary fig- 
ures because (he bills from 
aitomeys were sent directly to 
the insurance company 

Branson was unable to 
comment on the mailer. 

"Chancellor Wanell needs 
to make himself available lo 
answer the charges, " Briggs 
added. "This is a public 
institution." 

This latest lawsuit against 
the university, this time by an 
outside source, echoes the frus- 
tration felt both on and off 
campus about (he many policy 
and personality issues thai 
have been the center of atten- 
tion in recent months. 

In spring, campus Purdue 
faculty voted against approv- 
ing a 20-page faculty griev- 
ance policy. 

According to Wanell, the 
disagreement is about how the 
IPFW Purdue faculty was con- 
sulted in the development of 
Ihe policy. 

Representatives chosen by 
the Fort Wayne Senate met 
wiih a represcniative from 
Purdue University, Caroline 



"Our intent is 
to continue to look at 
IPFW and compel 
the trustees to do the 
job they're paid 
to do and keep 
the university 
functioning." 

-John Briggs, 
Frost Illustrated 



Jones. 

Jones met with the faculty 
representatives to discuss their 
opinions of the (at the lime) 
current policy, Wanell said. 

However, the faculty did 
not get prior review of the final 
draft of the policy, so it was 
voted down. 

This action has resulted in 
a lack of any grievance policy 
for Purdue faculty members on 
(his campus in the fall. 

In contrast, the grievance 



policy for Indiana University 
faculty members on campus is 
two pages long and was par- 
tially written by faculty, 

As of July 1, Purdue is in 
charge of the campus but IU 
handles disputes that involve 
IU departments. 

According to the 
Management and Academic 
Mission Agreement approved 
last fall, Purdue is "designated 
as the responsible corporation 
with full power, authority and 
responsibility to manage and 
operate IPFW for benefit of 
Indiana University and Purdue 
University and do all things 
necessary and proper for that 
purpose." 

The agreement also states 
that Purdue University will 
appoint and employ the posi- 
tions of chancellor and all 
other administrative officers. 

lUPU-Indianapolis, in 
contrast, is run by Indiana 
University and its. faculty is 
comprised of approximately 80 
percent IU faculty and 20 per- 
cent Purdue faculty. 

IUPUI's Indiana faculty, 
has only a single grievance 
policy that applies to both IU 
and Purdue faculty members 

IPFW's situation is noi 
entirely the same, said Wanell. 

At the present time, the 
IPFW facully consisis of 
approximately equal numbers 
of IU and Purdue employees, 
so it is necessary to have an IU 
grievance policy as well as a 
Purdue policy in place. 

"Our hope is that no one 
has an issue immediately [in 
the fall)," said Wanell. 

Campus is also reeling 
from the recent resignations of 
several key faculty and admin- 
istration. 

The mosl recent resigna- 
(ions were English and his 
wife, Beuy E, Steffy, dean of 
(he School of Education. Both 
resigned in early June. 

English and Sieffy have 
accep(ed positions at Iowa 
Slate University. 

"This is a public institu- 
tion,- (They] can't keep pre- 
tending things aren't happen- 
ing," said Briggs. 

The university is actively 
working lo solve (hese issues. 

"We are working to find an 
appropriate compromise," said 
Wanell. 

Frost Illustrated intends lo 
continue with its plans lo sue, 
according to Briggs, because 
the information requested still 
has not been provided by the 
university. 

"Our intent is to continue 
to look at LPFW and compel 
the trustees to do the job 
they're paid to do and keep this 
university functioning," Briggs 
said.

Happy Independence Day!

Informed consumers get 
best auto deals 



Bv Andrea Mettert 
News Editor 



Thinking aboul buying a used car? 

Well, you're not ihe only one. 

According to ihe Federal Trade 
Commission, Americans bought more 
than 40 million used vehicles in 1996, 
which is 73 percent of all auto sales for 
that year. 

The decision lo buy a used car can be 
a somewhat overwhelming idea, espe- 
cially with ail of Ihe choices thai are out 
there. 

However, there are some measures 
you can lake to ensure ihe purchase you 
make will be lo your best advantage. 

Before buying a used car, the Federal 
Trade Commission nxummends thinking 
about your driving habiis. needs and bud- 
get. 

Once you have decided how much 
you can afford to spend on a car, the next 
step is locating a vehicle that reflects 
your budget. 

There are three basic sources for 
buying a used car: private dealers, new 
dealer lots that sell used cars, and a used 
car lot. 

"I highly recommend buying from an 
individual." said Chris Moore, 
Auiomouve Service Excellence Master 
Technician. 



According to Moore, individuals are 
generally more honest about the service 
records than a dealer would be. 

There is a down side to buying a car 
from a private owner, however. 

Privaie sellers generally are noi cov- 
ered by the Used Car Rule, which 
requires dealers lo post a Buyers Guide 
in every used car they offer for sale. 

Thai means that a private sale will 
probably be on an "as is" basis. 

There is also usually no warranty or 
service contract available through privaie 
owner sales. 

Moore rates buying from a new deal- 
er car lot that sells used cars as the sec- 
ond besi source for used vehicle pur- 
chase. 

"There is a big difference between a 
used car lot that just sells used cars and a 
new dealer car lot thai sells used cars 
also," Moore explained. 

Usually, the used cars on a new deal- 
er lot arc new car trade-ins. 

Thai means lhat people traded in 
their car because they wanted lo upgrade. 
"And," Moore continued, "they 
usually have taken pretty good care of 
iheir cars," sometimes even offering ser- 
vice records for their trade-ins. 

The third, and perhaps nskiest option 
is buying from a used car lot. 

Moore explained that "buying from a 
used car lot can cosl less, but usually the 
cars come from an auction, which means 



you never know what you are getting." 

When a car is bought from auction, 
there is nothing known about the pasi 
history of the car, and no one to talk to 
aboul what problems the car has had in 
the past. 

He also stated that there is no service 
record available for a car on a used car 
lot, which means there is no way to find 
out if the car was serviced regularly or 
not. 

There are some advantages lo buying 
a car from a lot. whether it be a used car 
lot or a new lot that sells used cars. 

All lots are required to post a Buyers 
Guide in the window of every used car 
they offer. 

The Buyers Guide must tell you 
whether the vehicle is being sold "as is" 
or with a warranty. 

It also warns buyers that spoken 
promises are difficuli to enforce and ibai 
they should gel all promises in writing. 

Along with these warnings, the 
Buyers Guide lists all the major mechan- 
ical and electrical systems on the car and 
suggests that you have it inspected by an 
independent mechanic before you buy.

Buying a used car? Don't get suckered into a 'lemon' 



Bv Andrea Mettert 
News Editor 



So, you've found a used car that inter- 
ests you. 

You've managed lo find a vehicle in 
your budget range ihat doesn't appear to be 
failing apan ai the seams. 

But do you really know what to look for 
when buying a used car? 

There are many warning signs that a car 
might not be exactly the sleal that you think 
it is. 

According to Chris Moore, Automotive 
Service Excellence Master Technician, the 
first thing you should always do is ask for 
service records. 

"If a car has had regular oil changes, 
then ii has probably been taken good care 
of," he explains. 

If the owner doesn't have copies of the 



car's maintenance record, the dealership or 
repair shop where most of the work was 
done may be willing to share their files with 
you. 

According to the Consumer Guide from 
die Federal Trade Commission, you should 
also examine the car yourself using an 
inspection checklist. 

These checklists can be found 
in many of the magazine articles, 
books and Internet sites thai deal 
with buying a used car. 

Make sure you talk to the pre- 
vious owner of ihe vehicle. 

Ask them aboul the car's his- 
tory and find out if were have 
been any major repairs done. 

Moore also suggests taking 
the car for a test drive. 

During the drive you should 
listen to the engine closely for any 
knocking, pinging, or hammering. 

All of these could be signs ihat 



anon while driving ihe car. 

Moore recommends doing a sudden 
stop when you are up to speed in order to 
check ihe brakes. 

"Make sure there is no break pedal puls- 
ing or chirping noises," be warned. 




The break pedal should be firm when 
pressed. 

Moore added thai you should make sure 
that no lights appear on the dash, such as the 
"banery" light, ihe "Check ABS" light, or 
ihe "Service Engine Soon" light. 

Any of these could signal existing prob- 
lems with the car. 

You should also be sure to check ihe lire 
condition and general appearance of ihe car. 

Make sure lo look carefully for rusi or 
places ihat have been "touched-up" lo hide 
defects in the car's body. 

The Federal Trade Commission also 
recommends having the car inspected by a 
certified mechanic ihat YOU hire. 

An inspection generally costs under 
5100 and will give you a general indication 
of the mechanical condition of the vehicle. 

They point out thai it is a good idea 10 
have the car inspected even if it has been 
"certified." 

A mechanical inspection is different 



from a safety inspection, which is not 
designed to determine the overall reliability 
or mechanical condition of a vehicle. 

Check the local Yellow Pages under 
"Automotive Diagnostic Service" 10 find a 
pre-purcbase inspection facility. 

If the dealer will not let you take ihe car 
off of the lot, you may be able to find a 
mobile inspection service thai will go to ihe 
dealer. 

Make sure ihat you gel a written report 
wiih a cost estimate from the mechanic so 
you can use the estimated repair costs to 
negotiate the price of the vehicle.

What in the world ts going on 
here at IPFW? From die way that it 
sounds by reading other forms of 
media, it sounds like the place is 
falling apart. Ii sounds as though 
everyone is getting the short end of 
the suck in every way possible. 

Where is everyone going? Four 
administrators have left and it 
seems thai, as each year passes, 
more students are leaving too. Is 
there some sort of epidemic going 
around that is scaring everyone off 
or is there just something in the 
water? Whatever it is, something 
needs to be done to keep people 
here. 

In other local papers, they say 
that die problems with the adminis- 
tration stem from the different 
grievance processes in each of the 
two parent colleges. Indiana 
University has a short two-page 
policy and Purdue had a proposed 
policy that was 20 pages long. 

Some involved feel thai the 
length of the policy reflecLs the so- 
called "iron hand" mat Purdue sup- 
posedly rules the campus with. 

The two colleges have signed 
an agreement that Purdue will run 
the IPFW campus for now, and 
Indiana will run the campus in 
Indianapolis. Does that mean that 
the school should be renamed 
PIFW? Surely not, but since our 
school cannot go to anyone else for 
money, it might as well be thai way. 

Because we're a "satellite pro- 
gram" of Purdue. IPFW is receiv- 
ing less state money per student 
than most of the other campuses of 
our size in die state. IPFW has to 
get this money through Purdue, 
which means a bunch of red tape to 
go through. 

What does all this mean to the 
students'' It means that each and 
every student gets less money spent 
on his or her education than if he or 
she bad gone to another school. 




€y Dtnny Sdc - editorial Cartoonist 



Ii means thai die school may 
not be able to afford to get all of the 
best candidates for available posi- 
tions and might have to settle for 
second best because it cannoi pay 
the highest salaries, It means that 
every person on this campus is get- 
ting hurt by this lack of state fund- 



ing. 

So, why should anyone care? 
For one thing, the main goal of any 
form of higher learning should be 
to give the best possible education 
to as many students as it can. This 
should then include better financ- 
ing for its institutions. 



Why isn't our school getting 
the type of financial backing that it 
should? 

The blame cannot fall on one 
member of die administration, but 
it seems, rather, that it is the frame- 
work of how the system is set up 
that is truly at fault. 



Our administration is just 
"stuck" with the rules. 

We probably will never know 
how to resolve this problem until it 
is actually something mat is not the 
least bit of our worries. 




The Crow's Warchest 



The remains of the famous 
"Unknown Soldier" from the Viet 
Nam era have finally been 
identified. 

It appears that modem technol- 
ogy has come a long way in the 
past twenty years, and as elated as I 
am to hear that the soldier will 
finally be given a proper burial 
under his birth name, a new argu- 
ment concerning "tradition" is 
brought to my ears. 

It seems dial there are some 
that question the morality of the 
exhumation in the first place, let 
alone the desecration of a national 
monument that has become the 
mourning site for hundreds of thou- 
sands of people who have losi 
loved ones in bailies on foreign 
lands. 

All I can say to these people is 
this: Sorry, put what's right is right. 

There's a simple reason why 
the government is being so coopcr- 
adve with the family at the center 
of this controversy, the Blassies. 

The Blassie family believes the

granted, but 

most of soci- 

e t y can 

understand 

the loss of a 

loved one. 

The big 
problem here 
seems to lie 
in the fact 
that by 
exhuming the 

body they have already disturbed 
one of the most sacred spots in our 
great nation: the shrine to our fall-

seemly thing to die 
for one's country."

en comrades who will never make 

ii home. 

Although I've personally seen 

die Tomb of ihe Unknown Soldier 
on more than 
one occasion 
and do fully 
support die idea 
underlying it, it 
doesn't make 
sense to me that 
a piece of mar- 
ble "represent- 
ing" so many 
dead soldiers 
could be more 
valuable than a 
family's love 
for a fallen 
loved one. 

Just as 
well, treating 
Mr. Blassie's 
remains as if 
they were less 

significant than a piece of marble is 

more disrespecting ihe dead than it 

is honoring them. 



I'll grant that our country is 
losing many time-honored tradi- 
tions these days due to alterations 
"needed for ihe sake of society" 
and thai many of them are being 
sold out to corporations looking for 
a new theme to push on the 
American public, but disregarding 
a body's right to proper burial is a 
tradition I'd like to see gone. 

Besides, who says the Tomb of 
the Unknown Soldier can't be a 
tomb withoui a body? 

In a way. it has the bodies of 
every unknown soldier in it from 
every war the United Slates has 
ever foughi in, domestic or foreign. 
The tradition that entails the Tomb 
is ihai of respect for the dead dial 
will never be found or identified. 
and 1 believe mat if there was some 
way we could honor these dead sol- 
diers by giving them the name 
recognition they deserve and 
restoring their lives back io them, 
we should do iL 

We owe it to all of them, after

No smoking: more than a sign 



Unless you have been silting in 
die closet for the past few weeks. 
you know thai you arc no longer 
able to smoke your cigarettes or 
cigars in public places around here. 

City council passed ihe much- 
hyped measure after Mayor Paul 
Helmke vetoed the bill. 

The first thing I would like io 
know is this: How many city coun- 
cil members smoke? 

I wouldn't be surprised if the 
answer was that none of them 
smoke. 

I'd have to admit thai I am noi 
your average smoker, 

I probably smoke 3-5 cigars a 
year, but I know thai if I were to be 
offered a cigar in a public place 
before the measure I would have 
smoked it in leisure with my 
companions. 

Now I have no choice but to 
smoke in my own home or out- 
doors. Is it right for ihe ciiy council 
(o pass a bill of this nature? 

/ would have to answer no. 



Even though I am not a person 
who smokes like a chimney, 1 know 
how it feels to enjoy, as well as to 
loathe, in the company of oihers the 
presence of ihc fine smell of a 
sweet cigar. 

For a minute, let's try to imag- 
ine why people would not want to 
allow other people to smoke in 
public places. 

1 Some people have allergies to 
smoke or have trouble breathing. 
(Wasn't there a reason why there 
were separate seating areas for 
smokers?) 

2. The lar from the smoke stains the 
walls and ihe carpet of restaurants. 

(// does that, but who cares?) 

3. People like to have control over 
what other people do and say. f This 
sounds reasonable.) 

4. Every year thousands of people 
die of lung cancer possibly due io 



smoking and 
second hand 
smoke. 

5. People like 
to use things to 
advance them- 
selves politi- 
cally and gel in 
good with pub- 
lic interest 
groups. 

So what is 
this policy 
going to actu- 
ally do for the 
good of all 
people? 

I'm having 
a hard time try- 
ing (o come up 
with answers 
to that one. 

I think of 
same effect as 
tbe 30s.

Many car lots also offer extend- 
ed warranties or service contracts. 

However, according to Moore, 
if you have the service records and 
can tell thai (he car has been taken 
care of. a service contract or 
extended warranty could be a waste 
of money. 

"A lot of general maintenance 
like oil changes, alternators and 
batteries arc not covered under 
warranty," he explained. 



ir you are interested in buying 
from an individual owner, Moore 
recommends looking in "The 
Peddler's Post" or a good newspa- 
per. 

"If you arc going to buy from a 
lot," he continued, "make sure you 
shop around. Compare and explore 
your options!" 

"Remember," Moore conclud- 
ed, "all used cars are going to have 
some kind of maintenance that will 



need to be done." 

That's why it is so important to 
do the research on any prospective 
car before you decide to invest your 
hard-earned money.

Once you have found the car 
that fits your budget and meets 
your inspection, the final question 
is how to pay for it. 

You can opt to pay in full, or 
you can finance over lime. 

Financing increases the total 
cost of the car because you're also 
paying for the cost of credit. 

The main factors to consider 
when financing are bow much you 
can put down, the monthly pay- 
ment, the length of the loan, and the 
annual percentage rate (APR). 

The Federal Trade Commission 



warns consumers to be wary of 
advertisements offering financing to 
first-time buyers or people with bad 
credit. 

Most of these offers require a 
big down payment and are at a very 
high APR. 

They suggest that if your budget 
is tight, you might want to consider 
paying cash for a less expensive car 
than you first had in mind. 

If you do decide to finance, 
make sure you understand the exact 
price you're paying for the vehicle 
and the amount you're financing. 



According to the FTC, you 
should also make sure you under- 
stand the finance charge (the dollar 
amount the credit will cosi you) and 
the APR of the loan. 

You should also find out the 
number and amount of payments 
and the loial sales price of the loan. 
which includes the monthly pay- 
ments and down payment. 

Buying a used car can be a 
nerve-racking experience, but fol- 
lowing lhe.se lips can help you sepa- 
rate the lemons from the deals.

Battle of the Paintball Brigades 



By Adam Taylou 

Staff Whiter 



The dew slowly setlles upon a 
lightless ground as ihe Indiana twi- 
light begins to wane. 

Emerging from ihe smoke, a tall 
young man winds his way through a 
maze of tents being careful not to 
wake his sleeping soldiers. 

His boys did good that day, be 
thought to himself, and need not be 
disturbed. 

Approaching the larger tent, the 
man lightly tapped on the flap and 
entered with the hushed "Come in" 
from his commander. 

"Good evening, sir," the man said 
to his commander as he underwent 
the formalities of addressing a rank- 
ing officer. 

"Good evening, Colonel," the 
General relumed. "Have a seat and 
I'll hear your report." 

As the colonel took his seal, he 
took out a wrinkled piece of paper 
from his pocket. 

"Well, we did fairly well for the 
first day. The boys got beaten back 
pretty bad on the right flank, due to 
an unexpected flanking maneuver, 
but they were quick lo recover with 
some help from O'Reilly's unit. 
Almost lost the flag..." 

"Excellent work. Colonel. And 
what were the losses?" 

"Losses were pretty bad for both 
sides, I'm afraid. At least we hit them 
as hard as they hit us, though. Our 
ammunition is running a little low, 
but wc do have plenty of artillery 
remaining." 

"I'll have my adjutant go after 



more paint balls in the morning, 
when they open. If they attack at first 
light, will you have enough ammuni- 
tion to hold them off a few hours?" 

"Yes sir, we should be good for 
about six hours or so, depending 
upon the nature of the fighting. How 
arc ihe plans for the offensive on ihe 
road coming along, if youdon'tmind 
my asking?' 

"Well, going by what you just told 
me, 1 think we should be able to pull 
it off after we gel re-supplied. Ihey 
have their bottle rocket launchers 
placed on some high ground just east 
of the road, but we should probably 
be able to take them before the 
assault. Private Jenkins recently 
acquired a shipment of Mexican bot- 
tle rockets that could probably take 
them in a duel, if our aim's as good 
as it was today." 

"Mexican, 
sir?" ihe colonel 
queried with eyes 
agape. "Aren't 
those dangerous?" 
"This whole 
war's dangerous. 
Colonel," the gen- 
eral curtly replied. 
"You were made 
well aware of that 
before we started. 
as well as the 
amount of money 
involved should 
anything go 
wrong. At any 
rate, if all goes 
according to plan, 
we'll be camped 
around iheir flag 
this time tomorrow. Now go get 
some sleep, son. You'll need it for 
tomorrow's work." 

"Yes sir. Good day. General." 



The only thing the 
colonel could make 
out in all the carnage 

was the flashing 

lights of three County 

Sheriff cars and the 

red and orange lights 

covering them. 



The colonel awoke the next 
morning to a mass of confusion and 
the sounds of paint ball guns being 
fired. 

Rising quickly to his feet, he 
grabbed his own gun and snuck a 
peek out ihe flap of his tent to make 
sure everything was clear. 

Just as be did, a paint ball flew in 
his tent and plastered his chest with 
orange paint. 

Sparing his curse words for later, 
he threw down his gun and put on the 
red bandanna characteristic of ihe 
Dead and went out lo observe ihe 
remainder of the day. 

As he watched, he was some- 
what shocked at what all he was see- 
ing. 

The opposing side had apparent- 
ly launched a pre-dawn raid on iheir 
camp in an attempt to lower morale, 
but despite his get- 
ting hit the iroops 
.seemed to be beating 
the enemy back with 
extreme prejudice. 

As tbe attack 
waned, he saw a 
small handful of 
enemy men running 
in a panic back to 
their lines guarding 
ihe road. 

His boys had won 
again. 

With a sigh, he 
reported to the 
graveyard in the 
middle of the battle- 
field to mingle with 
ihe Dead. 
He informed his 
iheir end the pre- 



comrades that 

vious day of what the other side had 
in store for ihem that day and found 
out from his former enemies that had 



recendy been killed that there was no 
way that such an assault could be 
beaten back. 

Things were looking better and 
better for his Cause as his enemies 
revealed ihe location of their flag; 
the prime objective of the game. 

As soon as the artillery could 
clear off the high ground, the day 
would be won. 

Looking at the sky and seeing the 
sun was nearing its zenith, the 
colonel awaited the familiar stream 
of botde rockets from bis side plung- 
ing over to the enemy's elevated 
position. 

Sure enough, there they flew. 

The resulting barrage would only 
last five minutes, though, as enemy 
artillery fire came back slower and 
slower. 

Pretty soon, all was quiet again 
as the enemy pulled back their boiile 
rocket launchers to the safety of the 
woods. 

Noi three minules laier, il began. 
The shrill cry of his boys filled the 
air as they plunged headlong towards 
the road and met with little resis- 
tance. 

The road would be covered in 
red paint in no time. 

They charged gallantly, firing all 
the way. Little could be seen of the 
road that wasn't covered in red. 

The only thing tbe colonel could 
make out in all the carnage was the 
flashing lights of three County 
Sheriff cars and the red and orange 
paint covering them. 

The day was won, it appeared, 
but only by the blindfolded vigilance 
of Lady Justice.

Book examines controversial past 



By Adam Taylor 
Staff Writer 



History is a very delicate matter to handle. It can be 
purposefully distorted, as Nazi Germany chose to do. 

It can be forgotten or lost, as Medieval European 
history was. 

It can also be accidentally misrepresented, as author 
Richard Shenkman proves in his New York Times best- 
seller "Legends, Lies and Cherished Myths of 
American History" and his follow-up "1 Love Paul 
Revere, Whether He Rode or Not." 

In his two novels, Shenkman thoroughly addresses 
various misconceptions that have arisen throughout ihe 
course of history in ihe United Slates. 

Some of the subject matter he treats in his study can 
be rather mystifying and hard to believe though, despite 
his placement of footnotes throughout his books and 
listing references at the end. 

Giving evidence that Independence wasn't declared 
on the 4ih of July and lhai a third of all of the babies 
bom in ihe iweniy-year-period before the Revolution 
were bom out of wedlock, one might question his cred- 
ibility. 

However, in stating these facts, the level of scrutiny 
he employs is dazzling. 

For example, in dealing with the topic of war and 
the subject of Germany's bankruptcy after World War I 
in his "Legends, Lies and Cherished Myths of 
American Hlslory," Shenkman says: • 

"Tbe belief that Germany was bankrupted by the 
Versailles Treaty was advanced by the foremost econo- 



mist of the century, John Maynard Keynes, and is fre- 
quently considered the chief cause of Adolf HiUer's rise 
to power. 

"Actually, Germany was responsible for Germany's 
economic troubles; the demand for war reparations 
made at Versailles had little lo do with ihe matter, 

"The First World War cost Germany about S 100 bil- 
lion; war reparations only came to about S32 billion. 

"Undoubtedly the reparations demanded in the 
Versailles Treaty strained the German economy, but it 
was probably already ruined by war. 

"As a comparison, consider this: Germany speni 
almost as much on World War I as the United Slates, 
forty years later, spent on Vietnam. (America spent 
about S120 billion.) 

"Put another way, German outlays during ihe war 
equaled the entire United States budget in 1965." 

Although I've never done any follow-up research on 
the matter, the records he describes are readily available 
in ihe Library of Congress for me to do so, just as he 
did 

He writes in a manner that leaves his reader guess- 
ing as to whai he'll say next and usually only deals with 
subjects that are well-known to the common person, 
such as discussing Christopher Columbus ot George 
Washington. 

This provides for easy reading that doesn't bog 
down the reader with too much information at one time. 

He can be shocking one minute and humorous the 
next, giving plenty of entertainment all the while. 
Richard Shenkman's "Legends, Lies and Cherished 
Myths of American Hlslory" and his "I Love Paul 
Revere, Whether He Rode or Not" are both in them- 
selves good buys to pass a slow Sunday away.

AT THE BOX OFFICE 



r3e^onol iho ^&gt;cYopy\ 



Originals always come oat on top 



By Jeremy Ecenbaroeh 
Staff Writer 



Question: Anyone ever watch a 
television show, say a soap opera, 
and your favorite actor or actress 
gets replaced with another? 

And even though ihcy are por- 
traying the exact same person. 
somehow that character seems to 
lose his or her magic. 

How many limes have you said 
lo yourself, "Ehh, I hate that"? 

Well, the same thing happens in 
films, and, lei me tell you, 1 detest 
that. ..well, most of the time. 

The movie industry must 
approach problems in the best way 
possible. 

When a movie is a box-office 
hit and sequels are involved, quick 
decisions must be made. 

Nevertheless, in many of the 
cases, maybe it would have been 
better to have particular characters 
just be killed off instead of bringing 
them back, but each lime portrayed 
by different celebrities. 

Then switching the character 
completely can be an even bigger 
disaster. Oh, how it drives me 
insane. 

Let's take the "Batman" 
movies. 

There have been four films in 
the franchise, yet the caped crusad- 
er has been played by three differ- 
ent actors: Michael Keaton, Val 
Kilmer and George Clooney. 

In my opinion, the films lost 
their quality with each change in 
the lead character. 

Some may blame it on the sup- 
porting cast that has consisted of 
such big names as Jack Nicholson. 
Michelle Pfieffer, Jim Carrey and 
Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

Nevertheless, audiences 
became accusiomed to Keaton in 
the first few films and were not 
willing to accept a change 

Keaton had a higher price tag. 
However, the results ai ihe box 
office proved that the directors had 
made a mistake. 

Can anyone keep up with ihe 
aclor who portrays the famous 
James Bond "007' character? 

It all started with the larger- 
than-life Sean Connery and has 
now gotten lo the seductive Pierce 



Bros nan. 

They are like bookends because 
they both have made the most out 
of the James Bond roll 

Don't believe me? Well, have 
you seen either of the other iwo 
actors in anything else lately? I did- 
n't think so. 

Brosnan is bringing the notori- 
ous character back in style, when it 
bad become nearly dead and buried. 

Horror movies often use this 
tactic too, with bad consequences 
most of the time. 

In "A Nightmare on Elm 
Street 3: Dream Warriors," 
Patricia Arqueite made the Kristin 
character a girl "not to be messed 
with." But along came the sequel, 
"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: 
The Dream Master," where 
Kristin returned, but Arquette did 
noL 

Luckily, the poor actress who 
took on the role, Tuesday Night, 
was put out of her misery early in 
Ihe film. Arquette has recently gone 
on lo bigger and better things. 

The "Halloween" franchise did 
the exact same thing. Danielle 
Harris made the role of Jamie Lloyd 
quite comparable to that of leg- 
endary "scream queen" Jamie Lee 
Curtis. 

Nevertheless, after handing in 
two outstanding performances in 
both Halloweens 4 and 5, she was 
replaced in 6. 

An unknown actress, J.C. 
Brandy, look the part and did all she 
could do with it. Low and behold, 
she was killed off within the first 
half hour of the film. In short, the 
film was not much of a success. 

Luckily, Curtis will be reprising 
the Laurie role this fall in another 
sequel and hopefully clean up the 
mess that "Halloween: The Curse 
of Michael Myers" left behind. 

This next one is the best one of 
all. The "Phantasm" series look 
the main character Mike, originally 
played by A. Michael Baldwin, and 
switched the actor and then 
switched him back. 

The cult classic "Phantasm" 
was a minor hit, bul the producers 
saw its potential. 

Therefore, with a little more 
money and a more attractive lead 
actor. Matt LeGross, "Phantasm 
2" became a huge success. 

Still, the original creators 



rW If 



gained control once again. 

When they made "Phantasm 
3: Lord of the Dead," Ihey 
brought back Baldwin. 

The change turned out to be a 
lousy one because the fiim grossed 
less money than both its predeces- 
sors. Maybe they will do a switch 
again. Who knows. 

In this category, the list goes on 
and on. Wesley Snipes disappeared 
after ihe first "Major League" 
movie, but his character sure did 
not. 

And even though they were not 
the same character, Jason Patric 
could nol louch the strength or 
endurance that Keanu Reeves 
brought to the "Speed" series. 

Sasha Jenson killed the 
"Kkkboxer" franchise that Jean 
Claude Van Damme made a 
promising start for. 

Seriously, what were these 
movie-makers thinking? 

Next they will be trying to 
make another "Die Hard" movie 
without Bruce Willis, another 
"Alien" movie without Sigoumey 
Weaver, or even a "Free Willy" 
without Willy. 

Let's not even go there. If ihey 
just stick wilh what works, they'll 
be fine.

Avoiding the relatives? 

Here's a movie to keep you entertained this weekend 



By Adam Taylor 
Staff Writer 



Looking for fire works beyond the 4th of July? Then 
perhaps you could stand to rent "Blown Away." 

Although being relatively old by rental standards, 
having come out in 1994, the story docs really well 
and moves along excellently with the help of some 
really good actors. 

It stars Jeff Bridges as a Boston Police Department 
bomb disposal expert named James Dove lhat has a 
secret, shady past that comes back to h'junt him when 
his old comrade Ryan Gaerity (Tommy Lee Jones) 
breaks out of an Irish prison and moves 10 Boston. 

As Gaerity sits in a bar having drinks with a few 
lady friends, be recognizes a man on television This 
man. Dove, was responsible for twenty years Gaerity 
spent in jail. 

Now, Dove is a local hero who is knowledgeable 
about bombs and how to take them apart safely. 

Dove, whose real name is Liam McGivney, was a 
soldier under Gaerily's Anti-British Army back in 
Belfast twenty years ago. 

Angry over Dove's new-found fame, Gaerity 
devises a plot lo ruin Dove's happy new life by lolling 
off his family and friends with bombs. 

Despite teaming all he knows from Gaerity, Dove 
has no idea who the bomber is until Gaerity chooses 10 
let him know. 

All Dove knows is he wants off the force so he can 
spend time with his new wife and stepdaughter but he 
can't leave until ihe bomber is caught. 

All in all, il's a great movie. The effects are spec- 
tacular, as is the cinematography. 

The director leaves out no detail in his portrayal of 
the various explosions Gaerity creates. 

He also does a great job of tying everything 
together lo create enough =.u-&gt;peri&gt;.e and action to fill in 
the iwo hours and not make you think you've been sil- 
ling there that long 

The acting, though, is the icing on the cake. The 
movie is stacked with famous actors, although some 
didn't even have big parts. 

There's Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones, of 
course, but there's also Lloyd Bridges (Jeff's father, 
who recently died). 



Lloyd Bridges plays James/Liam's uncle, and is 
one of the few people who knows of James' past. 

He's a retired cop. bom in Ireland, and raised in 
the United States; he is rarely seen in the movie with- 
out a botde of Guinness. 

His accent is pretty thick, but il's also very 
convincing. 

Another convincing accent is that of Tommy Lee 
Jones. His character is rather amusing, reminiscent of 
his role in "Batman Forever" as the villain "Two 
Face," although a bit more childish in his 
amusements. 

The first thing he does upon settling down in the 
abandoned shipwreck he chooses for his new home is 
to break oul bis toys and start playing, laughing up a 
storm. 

He often incorporates the use of a children's toy 
(such as rubber tipped arrows or silly putty) in the con- 
struction of his bombs, providing an interesting clash 
of innocence wilh the deadliness of his 
creations. 

He seems to be very jovial about his work, even 
though his work means taking other people's lives. 
Despite the resulung carnage, he somehow makes ii 
seem amusing lo himself. 

Forrest Whilaker also lends a hand in humor as he 
plays a cocky bomb disposal expert that lakes Dove's 
place upon his retirement to be wilh his new wife. 

Although he doesn't gel along with Dove at all 
they become partners in tracking down Gaerity, pro- 
viding for an interesting "Lethal Weapon" kind of 
partnership between me two. 

They save each other's lives throughout the movie 
and attack each other's character just as much, if noi 
more. 

Be sure to look for a cameo appearance by Cuba 
Gooding, Jr. in one of these scenes as Dove attempts 
10 leach a class on land mines while being harassed by 
Whitaker's character. 

Regardless, though, of why you rent il. "Blown 
Away" is definitely one lo rent for those that love 
action/suspense movies. 

The characters enhance the movie a great deal and 
the effects are superbly executed, making for a highly 
entertaining two hours. 

Next time you're oul at ihe video counter wonder- 
ing what to rent, you mighl want to give it a try. You 
won't be lei down.
