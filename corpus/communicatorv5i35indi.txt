Scott: all we want 
is to stay even 



ByKURTULLMAN 

Clifford Scott, state president of 
the American Association of Univer- 
sity Professors (AAUP) thinks that 
the increa; 



iby 

the IU-PU faculty is realistic. 
"Basically all we want to do is keep 
up with the cost of living", said Scott. 
a professor of history at this campus. 
In a Thursday interview with The, 
COMMUNICATOR, Scott outlined his 
feelings. "The legislature makes 
allowances for automatic increases in 
the price paid for telephones, fuel and 
other fixed costs. We feel that faculty 
cost of living increases should be 
handled the same way." 



He cited that the lacuiiy &lt;. 
campus last year had i 
salary equal to only one third to one 
fourth of the rise in the cost of living 
indexes. Scott charged that even 
when there is money within the 
budgets to give the instructors more 
money, the administrations are 



"They tell us that if they raise 
faculty salaries too high, athey are 
afraid that the legislature may cut 
their budgets, stated the AAUP chief. 
"We are not asking for a raise in 
buying power, all we want to do is 



collectively with the state, Scott 
pointed out that the state decides 
what the increase wuld be and the 
faculty is given the choice of 
accepting the job or leaving the 
school. Scott also noted that some of 
the professors are beginning to take 
hard looks at the wage schedules for 
local industry and to compare them to 
their salaries and fringe benefits. 

An added burden to many of the 
faculty on the campus according to 
Scott, is that many of the faculty on 
this campus are young and most have 
families to support. "Most of us losrt

Board OK's funds 
for tennis courts 



Tennis courts may soon be a 
reality for Indiana-Purdue as two 
groups have announced their plans to 
allocate money for construction of the 
courts. 

The Joint Athletic Committee 
(JAC) voted Thursday to allocater 
$5,000 in the 1974-75 budget for tennis 

The Student Senate voted earlier 
to earmark $10,000 of their 1974-75 
activity fee budget to go for the sports 
addition. 

Both allocations are contingent 
upon the raising of donations by 
university officials to cover the rest of 
the costs needed to build the courts. 
According to Roland Clements, a 
member of the JAC, between $30,000 
and $50,000 is needed for the 6 court, 
lighted structure. 

Although no building dite has 



been selected officially, Clements 
said, "We hope to have the courts by 
the start of the next school year." 

Edwin C. Leonard, chairman of 
the JAC, said, "Tennis courts as well 
as other athletic facilities are sorely 
needed on this campus. These courts 
are a step in the right direction." 

Clements commented that the 
JAC will probably set up regulations 
regarding the use of the courts. He 
said, "Of course, they'll be mainly for 
student use." 

He added that the tennis team will 
probably use 
hours daily. 

Clements noted, "I think that with 
tennis being such a fast growing 
sport, this is something this campus 
really needs." He added, "I'm just 
glad to see us finally on the road to 
getting them."

Scott felt that collective bargain- 
ing legislation is essential to the 
faculty in the next legislative session. 
Noting that collective bargaining 
measures have failed in the past two 
sessions of the legislature, Scott 
called on the local delegation to do 
something at the next session. "We 
feel that it is better in the long run to 
have collective bargaining with 
compulsory arbitration, than a 
disenchanted faculty threatening a 
work stoppage. While I would prefer 
not to strike because it would hurl the 
students, the faculty is feeling the 
pinch of higher prices,"

THE MAGIC MIRROR 



'Death just as real as life' 



Merger fraud 



It is fast becoming the common notion on this campus that the 
super-chancellor agreement of last November was a deliberate fraud on 
the parts of the two university presidents, Ryan and Hansen. 

Most of us are remembering well Purdue Provost Robinson standing 
in front of some 300 faculty, staff, and students and repeatedly telling 
those 300 that "this should be one institution." 

At that time it appeared that the two parent universities had finally 
relented and were willing to let us merge as an autonomous part of the 
total systems. We lived on that hope for a number of months. 

But then the two presidents came to IU-PU and burst our bubble. 
They said that we could not merge because the state legislature had not 
given them the authority to allow such a merger. At least one state 
legislator could not recall the two universities ever requesting such 
authority. 

These unfortunate revelations caused us to think back on the 
circumstances surrounding the super-chancellor agreement. Various 
faculty groups were voting for complete independence from IU and 
Purdue. The staff and student body were vocally upset. The state 
k'Hiskiture was soon to be in session and would consider independence for 
campuses in Indianapolis. South Bend, and Evansvilie. And, of course, 
the Keenan Report suggested independence as the ideal for this campus. 

Then, very, very suddenly, two universities which have been at each 
others' throats since day one reached an agreement to merge the Fort 
Wayne Campus. They had the audacity to tell us that the agreement had 
been in the works for three years, 

And we had the audacity to believe in a fairy tale like that. 

But now the true intentions of the presidents are known. The 
super-chancellor will be appointed not to merge IU-PU into one, but to 
insure that IU-PU stays apart as two. 

The presidents must feel that since the legislature will not be in 
session again until next January they need not worry about the restless 
natives in Fort Wayne. This newspaper respectfully suggests that they 
had better get worried fast, because next time they cannot buy the peace 
with promises. 



Streaking for fitness 

Perhaps streaking is the answer for everyone. Maybe 
if the entire world would become one big streaking society, people would 
have more incentive (or keeping physically fit. 

According to Gbnville Downy, an authority on ancient Greece and 
Rome and a professor at Indiana University-Bloomington, in an article 
printed in the Communicator, the Greeks often performed in the nude. 

The people of the civilized Greek society admired a human body that 
was in the best of shape, and therefore, in their Olympic games, the 
participants ran in the nude. 

The body should be a beautiful thing. In the Greek society by 
performing in the nude there was more of an incentive to keep in good 
physical condition. 

Observing some of the wonderous physiques of Indian-Purdue 
students, faculty and staff, it's understandable why they are fully 
clothed. 

Physical fitness is worthy of more than appearance. It being an 
important factor for a healthy life, maybe the energy crisis might change 
the attitudes ot the society inward physical fitness. 

There will probably be more bicycles on the road when the warm 
weather arrives, but the problem is that it will be the same exercise 
enthusiasts who will be riding them. The ones who really need the 
exercise will continue to sit at home and eat. 

Its not uncommon to see one gasping for breath after climbing a 
single flight of stairs at Indiana-Purdue. 

If the Library had no elevators, the third and fourth floors would 
never be used. 

Evidently most students, faculty, and staff buy "A" stickers only so 
they won't have to walk too far. 

Even on the nicest day of spring, you won't see an "A" lot stickered 
car parked in the "AB" lot. 

Many students, faculty, and staff members figure the shortest and 
easiest ways to get places are the most convenient for them, and their 
bodies are solid evidence of this Often they are real solid evidence. 

How many people at this university would have the courage to streak 
without feeling embarrssed by the condition of their bodv? 



ICPA promises support 

The Communicator staff received a letter from the Indiana 
Collegiate Press Association (ICPA), of which this newspaper is a 
member. Carbon copies of the letter were sent to Deans Manges and 

The following is the text of that letter: 

Dear ICPA Members, 

With a large measure of dismay and regret, I read the 
front page "Staff Statement" in the February 14. 1974, 
issue of Indiana-Purdue Communicator, concerning the 
possible demise of your newspaper. 

With an equal measure of delight, I was pleased to 
discover in the editorial section of the February 21, 1974, 
issue that the Communicator is alive and well again. 

I have discussed your management concerns and 
difficulties with President Myers and Vice-President 
Schroeder, who visited your office recently. Both 
expressed deep and genuine concern about the fate of the 
Communicator, and both are pleased with your ultimate 
recovery. 

Your unfortunate situation was not unique. Enclosed is 
a progress report prepared under the auspices of the 
National Council of College Publications Advisers, its 
Committee on the Legal Status of the Campus Press, 
which may offer helpful guidelines for smoother relations 
in the future.

Association stands ready to encourage your growth and 
prosperity, and we will certainly appreciate news from

the reality of life after death in this

INDIANA - PURDUE 
COMMUNICATOR 



Jeff Gibson colls Viet story statements 'patently false' 



To the Editor: 

I must respond in depth to what I , 
see as a blatant misrepresentation of 
facts in the February 28th Magazine 
section of the Communicator entitled 
Embattled South Viet Nam. In these 
articles I find direct distortion of two 
vital issued in South Vietnam: Thieu's 
land reform program and the 
question of Political Prisoners. The 
articles state that the land reform 
program is a "success" and virtually 
deny that problem of political 
prisoners even exists. 

Some of the articles' more 
outstanding statements are "a sur- 
prisingly bright note is the nearly 
completed new land reform program 
carried out with considerable success 
(emphasis mine) in the midst of a 
continuing war. More than 1.3 million 
hectares have been distributed to 
800,000 persons." And "The 'political 
prisoner' issue appears greatly 
exaggerated, best available informa- 
tion (emphasis mine) indicates that 
there are less than 35,000 civilian 
prisoners in the entire country, and 
not many of these can be classified as 



Such statements are patently 
false, and it causes me no end of 
wonder why the authors of these 
articles or the sources for these 
"facts" were not identified. Under 
what terms can the land reform 
program be termed a "success?" 
Who or what is the "best available 
information" on the number of 
political prisoners in South Vietnam? 
In the following paragraphs I will 
attempt to present evidence contrary 
to picture given in the Communicator 
articles. 

Land Reform Program: Accord- 
ing to Senator Edward Kennedy in his 
study Mission Report of the Judiciary 
Subcommittee on Refugees, the 
actual intent of the land reform 
program is not benevolent resettle- 
ment of refugees, but an attempt on 
the part of the Saigon government to 
expand the Government of Vietnam's 
territory at the refugee's expense. 
This effort is both coercive and 
deliberate. Land "given back" to the 
refugees is either uninhabitable due 
to bombing or defoliation or was 
never fertile soil in the first place. 

The resettlement programs are 
often used as a means of government 
control and surveillance. . Debrah 
Wiley of American Report states that 
if a Vietnamese peasant wants to 
move from one city to another, 
permission must be obtained from the 
village officials, a picture of the 
person is then forwarded t 



you in the future. 



Sincerely, 

(S) Dr. William M. Lawbaugh 
Executive Secretary 



number of South Vietnamese refugees 
extends far beyond the impression 
given in the Communicator articles. 



Kennedy states that in reality 
1,855.000 South Vietnamese civilians 
have been made refugees. Many of 
these people are kept in crowded 
(.amps with the warning: "Attention, 
citizens. If you attempt to go back to 
your ancestral homes in Communist 
areas, you will be shot to death." 
Relocation sites are neither estab- 
lished at the refugees' old village 
location nor do they hold any 
resemblance to a Vietnamese village. 

Rather than Thieu's Land Reform 
Program being a success, it is a paper 
farce and a human tragedy. 

Political prisoners: According to 
President Thieu in a statement made 
to Pope Paul VI on April 9, 1973. 
"There are no political prisoners in 
South Vietnam. There are only two 
kinds of prisoners: 21,007 of common 
law and 5,081 Communist criminals." 

Many other organizations whose 



tally with Thieu's remark. 

181,000: South Vietnamese Com- 
mittee to Reform the Prison System; 
June, 1973. 

More than 240,000: Anglican 
News Service (Canadian) ; December 
14,1972. 

200,000: Ngo Cong Due (who got 
his figures by adding up the numbers 
in each prison. As a former 
Vietnamese National Assemblyman, 
he had access to this type of 
information); reported in the New 
York Times, Sept. 7, 1972. 

After his Easter Week 1973 trip to 
South Vietnam, Auxiliary Bishop 
Thomas J. Gumbleton of Detroit 
wrote, "I can state unequivocally that 
there are political prisoners in 
Saigon's jails and in jails throughout 
the provinces. They are not in jail for 
any crime, but simply because they 
are in opposition to the present 
government. The proof is overwhelm- 
ing. And it is clear that these 
prisoners are subject to inhumane 
treatment, including deliberate and 
prolonged torture." 

Thieu's budget for 1973 provides 
for 400,000 prisoners. And by official 
count the U. S. Phoenix Operation in 
Vietnam detained at least 100,000 

In order to decrease the number 
of political prisoners, the Saigon 
Government has been simply chang- 
ing their status to common criminal. 
The United States Embassy in Saigon 
wrote to Senator Kennedy that: 

"Before and since the ceasefire, 
the G.U.N. (Government of Vietnam) 
has been converting detainees to 



card violations or draft dodging." 

Most U.S. government reports 
only include a small percentage of the 
prisons when giving the number of 
prisoners. One "fact sheet" reported 



Dy i 



, head of the Indochina 



South Vietnam consists of four 
national prisons, one national juvenile 
correction center, and 35 provincial 
prisons." But Joseph Hannah, admi- 
nistrator of the U. S. Agency for 
International Development (which is 
the main channel through which 
Thieu's police and prison systems are 
financed ) , places the number of South 
Vietnamese prisons at 601. 



arrest of a person merely for his c 
her opposition to the policies of the 
government. (The Communicator 
article quotes U.S. Ambassador 
Graham Martin as stating: "We have 
not been able to identify a single 
person put in jail for the sole 
purpose of opposing the Thieu 
regime.") But in fact, the Saigon 
government has issued a series of 
laws and decrees that have resulted in 
thousands of citizens being arbitrarily 
arrested. These laws include the 
following: 

Article 2 of Decree Law 93-SL- 
CIT: Shall be considered as Pro- 
Communist Neutralist a person who 
commits acts of propaganda for and 
incitement of Neutralism. 

Article 19 of Decree Law 004-64 
makes it possible to administratively 
detain a Vietnamese citizen for up to 
two years without a trial or charge. 
This sentence is renewable. In a 
telegram of April 5,1973, from the 
Prime Minister's office, provincial 
authorities were urged to use 
administrative detention "if you don't 
have enough evidence to bring the 
person before a military tribunal." 

On January 22, in preparation for 
the impending Paris Peace Agree- 
ment, Thieu issued strict new edicts, 
including: 

"1. All police and military forces 
are permitted to shoot to kill all 
those who urge the people to 
demonstrate, and those who cause 
disorders or incite other persons to 
follow communism... 

"2. Arrest and detain those 
persons who incite the people to 
create disorder and confusion, or who 
leave those areas controlled by the 
government in order to go to 
Communist-controlled zones or vice 
versa. If they protest they will be 

"3. Detain those persons who are 
neutralist and those persons who 
publically side with the Communists, 
and who are active poltically. They 
will be taken before a military court 



Perhaps the most important issue 
to be raised in response to the 
Communicator articles is that neither 



the forced relocation or suppression 
of refugees nor the imprisonment and I 
torture of political prisoners could 
take place without U.S. support. The 
entire prison and police system is 



over 168 million dollars from 1968 to 
1973. Under the budget request for the 
U.S. Agency for International Deve- 
lopment the amount of aid to police 
and prisons from this source is from 

lillion dollars-a 40 per cent 

over last year. 
Other indirect ways of financing 



15 to 2 



the police and prison systems : 
through the Food for Peace Program, 
the Commodity Import Program, and 
the 85 million dollars titled "humani-. ■ 
larian aid." In all of these programs 
money or goods earmarked for 
beneficial uses is channeled into 
Thieu's police, prison and forced 
resettlement programs. Out of the 2 _ 
billion dollars of U.S. tax money"' 
marked for South Vietnam, 1.6 billion -; 
goes for repression. (Sources: USAID ' 
FY74 Program Presentation to 
Congress; USAID hearings before 
House Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
May-June 1973; Department of 
Defense FY74 Budget Request to". 
Congress.) 

The purpose of the torture and-' 
repression in South Vietnam is to 
quiet Vietnamese protesting their ■ 
lack of freedom there. Those people '' 
are South Vietnam's best hope for a • 
democratic future, yet they are jailed 
because they pose a threat to the ■ 
Thieu regime. 

The purpose of such articles as 
those in the Communicator seems to 
be to quiet Americans objecting to the 
use of their tax money to perpetuate 
the mistreatment of political prison- 
ers and refugees. But whether the 
truth is made know, distorted, or 
withheld, the fact remains that we 
bear a great deal of the reponsibility 
for what goes on within South 
Vietnam. As Senator James Abourezk 
has stated, "Maybe the American 
people don't have to know about troop

KING OF 

Just befor the 1973-74 World Hockey Association season 
got underway, an old, retired NHL relic signed a contract 
with the league's Houston franchise for a huge sum of 
money. His 18 and 20-year-old sons also signed with the 
same team and found themselves playing for triple figure 



One can sometimes see an established pro club paying a 
young potential superstar a large amount of gree just to 
keep him satisfied in hopes of many happy returns. But 
hwere is the rationale behind a struggling club paying a 
45-year-old codger and his two totally untested, super-young 
sons $200,000 a year EACH to play pro hockey? 

While with the Detroit Red Wings, Gordie Howe won 
six NHL scoring titles enroute to a record career 1,809 
points. And he performed for 25 years with a team that often 
finished seventh in a field of six teams. 

But his last two or three NHL years were a nightmare 
for the aging great. The team officials became totally inept 
at handling their tasks. The coaches could not handle their 
younger players. 

So after the 1971 campaign, Gordie Howe gathered 
everybody together and announced that he was getting out. 
Deep inside he knew hw could still be a better-than-average 
big league hockey player. But circumstances beyond his 
control had stacked the deck against him. 

Howe sat out the last two hockey campaigns and 
watched his youn sons play junior hockey in Canada. But 
last year the Houston Aeros decided to draft his 18-year-old 
son Mark in the 14th round of the WHA draft. 

As they say, one thing led to another, and soon a giant 
press conference was called to announce the signing of the 
Howe family. King Gordie did not want to return to hockey, 
down an unbelievable offer of $200,000 per 
year. Howe must have seriously contemplated asking the 
Aeros how much they would pay his father for re-donning 
his skates. 

So the Howe family n 
practicing under a wav 
became louder and mon 
apparent that the King w 

His skating was all kinds of slow and his shots wouls 
have been easily turned aside in the IHL Once he went 
crashing into the boards and attendants were summoned to 
take the corpse away. 

Sons Mark and Marty werre erratic. Preseason polls 
placed the Houston Aeros in the cellar or one rung above it. 

But little by little the Howes began to improve. Gordie's 
45-year-old legs began to respond and his shots began to 
regain their crispness and accuracy. The younger fellows 
gained confidence and showed signs of their father's 
greatness. Still, however, we predicted a long season for the 
Houston Aeros. 

At the start of the season, the Houston fan repsonse was 
disappointing. Gordie once chased down a purse thief in the 
downtown area and, upon returning the item to its owner, 
pleaded: "Why don't you and your boyfriend try to make a 
cuple of the Aero's games?" The indebted woman and her 
friend swore their allegiance. 

At this juncture, what can I say about the last several 
months concerning Gordie Howe and Sons and the Houston 
Aeros? Many of you I'm sure don't know what has 
transpired. You areabout as interested in the World Hockey 
Association as I am about Merle Haggard (if any of you are 
asking, "Merle who?" I thank youl. 

Gordie Howe just recently celebrated his 46th birthday. 



nature, you would promptly shove this newspaper i 
aside and move on to better things. 

I will say that 18-year-old left winger Mark Howe is a 

cinch to be the league's Rookie of the Year. I will rightfully 

that the Houston Aeros are solidly ii 



wed to sunny Houston to begin 

of chortles. And ithe laughs 

numerous as it became more 

floundering. 



the WHA West Division and a 



s threat to take it all ii 



Walton. 

Thus Mr. Howe has made prophets out of the insane 
Houston brass that took the inconceivale gamble in inking 
him and his sons. Of course he is a stride slower and his shot 
has less sizzle than that of his former self, but his increased 
passion and dedication for the game have greatly made up 
for his aging. 

Carl Brewers, former defensive stalwart in the rival 
NHL and now in the WHA (for money purposes) says of the 
irrepressible King : "Gordie is the dirtiest player who ever 
lived. A great player, but also the dirtiest. He'll gouge your 
eye out if you give him the chance, carve you up good. ' ' And 
believe me, that's a compliment from Brewer. 

So the King and Sons reign high and mighty in Houston. 
CAn you picture a successful hockey team in Texas? Only 
Gordie Howe could make that vision come true.
