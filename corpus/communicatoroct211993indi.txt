Staff produces paper 



The Communicator leached J his- 
toric milestone at Indian a- Purdue 
University Fort Wayne last week 
when in-house production of the entire 
paper became a reality. 

"The IPFW community is growing 
and The Communicator is reflecting 
that growth," said Joyce Stocks, 
advertising manager. 

In-bousc production means (bat the 
staff of The Communicator performs

Ramona MeGown, chief reporter, 
said becoming in-housc productive 
brings the staff closer. "We're not just 
turning in articles and leaving. We're 
interacting with one another, making 
the staff better," MeGown said. 

Printing of the newspaper is still 
handled by Steuben Printing on 
Thursday mornings while school is in 

Dorie Reynolds, the publisher, 
explained the significance of going to 
in-housc production. 

"Becoming in-housc productive 
gives IPFW students the opportunity 
to learn how to produce a newspaper 
using slate of the art equipment." she 



Prior to last week, the staff of The 
Communicator typed all of the articles 
on computer, copied the articles onto 
the the disk, then sent the disks and 
dummy layout sheets to Steuben 
Printing for production. 

Reynolds also explained that being 
in-housc productive allows The

"I'm happy to be on board, and this 
is a great experience," said Anderson. 

"The new equipment has helped to

Former colleague 
cites ethical 
problems 



John Taylor. IPFW Music chair, left 
his position at Tennessee Tech 
University (TTU) in the middle of con- 
troversy from two lawsuits filed by 
female professors. 

Taylor became the new chair in 
August after leaving Tennessee Tech 
University (TTU) in CookeviJIc. 
Tennessee. He was chair of music und 
fine arts from fall 1989 through spring 

1993. 

Taylor came to TTU after abruptly 
resigning from North Dakota Stale 
University in Fargo, North Dakota. He 
was accused of unethical behavior there 
also, although no lawsuits were filed. 

The university at Fargo is three insti- 
tutions on one campus: Concordia 
College. North Dakota State University 
(NDSU). and Moorhcad Minnesota 
Slate University. 

Taylor was chair of the Department of 
Music and Visual Arts and director of 
choral activities. 

Robert Pattengalc, chair of the Music 
Department at ND State University 
said. "We had a variety of ethical prob- 
lems and nin-ini with Taylor. [To other 
faculty and staff] be was difficult lo 
work with and was not collaborative. 
To his credit, though, he provided 
ciiUiusiain for tile students." 

Pattengalc said that before Taylor 
came lo his school, Ihc faculty had been 
cooperative with each other, but Taylor 
created hard feelings and competitive- 
ness between members. 

When he left, he look two faculty 
members lo TTU. None asked for 
releases until July, and school slarled in 
August. Pattengalc was furious thai 
(hey bad lo fill three positions in less 
than six weeks. 

"1 was going lu report Taylor to the 
National Association of Schools of 
Music for unethical behavior, " said 
Pattengalc. 

He decided not to report Taylor at Ihe 
lime because there were so many hard 
feelings and accusations, that he decid- 
ed lo mil stir up more trouble.

A new student organization is being 
founded on the IPFW campus. 

The first organizational meeting of the 
Native American Student Alliance was 
held October 18 in the Walb Student 
Union. 

Bob Hawley. associate professor of 
Human Services was selected. as the â€¢ 
advisor. His prior experience with 
Native American students made him 
realize this group had difficulty getting 
assistance and often these students 
withdrew. He was looking for a way to 

At first he thought there were oniy 7 
to 10 Native American students on this 
campus, but soon learned the number 
of students was close lo SO. He has 
received tremendous cooperative from 
Multicultural Services, 

"I was surprised lo find out bow many 
people have Native American heritage 
in the lineage," said Hawley. 

"But at the same time, I was shocked 
how hide has been done in relationship 




this minority," he added. 

Karen Monroe is a Miami Indian and 
a student at IPFW working towards an 
Associate Degree in Human Services. 
She is also affiliated with NASA. 

"This organization is a take-off from 
our lister program al Indiana 
University- Kokomo. I visited them last 
year and now our program is just ston- 
ing to take off." said Monroe, 

"Our general purpose is lo make the 
general population aware of our cul- 
ture," added Monroe,

Program improves 
professionalism and 
communication 
skills 



By KamonaMcGow 
Chief Reporter 



For many IPFW students juggling a 
pari time job and classes is al times, not 
only tiresome, but also unrewarding. 
FPFW's Co-op program, also known as 
Cooperative Education, allows students 
to pursue employment in their field of 
study al competitive wages and obtain 
college credit while attending school. 

"Those involved in the program 
improve on such qualities as profes- 
sionalism, stronger communication 
skills, and how to deal with the politics 
that often occur in the work place," said 
Diana Hcrgatl. Associate Director of 
Career Services and Cooperative 
Education. 



In the Co-op program, the faculty 
plays a key role in approving those 
positions offered by Ihe participating 
companies. If the faculty feels that the 
student will be challenged in the 
employer's environment and the posi- 
tion correlates with the current curricu- 
lum of the specific department, then the 
student will be allowed lo participate 
and receive crediL 

The professors also visit Ihc students 
and their employers to see how he or 
she has assimilated into those positions 
that they have been placed in. 

"One docs not necessarily have to 
have experience lo participate in the 




intellectual aspect of Native American 
cultures, and to help Native American 
high school students achieve their edu- 
cational and career goals." said 
Monroe. 

Il is interesting lo note Ibal Monroe is 
a direct descendant of Francis Siocum, 
who lived in the Wabash-Pcru area in 
the early 1800's. Siocum was captured 
by Indians in Wilkes-Banc, Pa., when 
she was five, and was raised by an 
Indian couple from Delaware. She later 
married a Miami Indian chief named 
She-po-co-nah. 

There arc other groups in Ihe area 
besides the Miami, which is the largest 
group. There are Sioux, Cherokee, and 
Winnebago represented locally 

In the 1990 census, the general popu- 
lation for Allen County published the 
figures at 929 Native Americans. 

Monroe, along with Anhur Sonier. 
created the concept for the NASA logo. 

Sonier, who is a Micmac Indian from 
the Nova Scotia designed the logo. 
Their intent was to stress the education 
aspect with the indian shield, 

"This is my donation to this college. I 
want people to realize that there are 
Native American's on this campus and 
they don't have to be ashamed of their 
heritage anymore," said Sonier.

Co-op program, the student just needs 
to be motivated, enthusiastic, and have 
a willingness lo learn." said Hergalt. 

Those students interested in the Co-op 
program must have completed the fol- 
lowing requirements; one must be an 
undergraduate student, and complete all 
the freshman requirements within one's 
major. Also there is a certain G.P.A, 
that is required. For those in 
Engineering and Technology the mini- 
mum G.P.A. is 4.7 on a 6 scale. In the 
school of Arts and Sciences the mini- 
mum G.P.A is 2.5 for I.U students and 
a 4.5 for Purdue students. 

The minimum G.P.A is a 2.5 for I.U. 
students and a 4.5 for Purdue students 
in the school of Business and 
Management . 

Any students wishing to have a more 
in depth informative session on the pro- 
gram itself, may attend a program. The 
Co-op Comer, on Monday, October 25 
from noon to I 30 p.m in Walb G-21 

This program will include a conglom- 
erate of students, employers, and facul- 
ty involved in the Co-op program The 
program will include the opportunity to 
talk personally with students currently 
involved with the Co-op program. 



Staff Editorial 

Sexual harassment 
is a growing problem 

"If we do not make our feelings known when 
someone is violating us verbally or non-verbally, 
we are not taking responsibility for ourselves. " 



It's happening all over. Sexual 
harassment cases are being 
brought against people every 
day. Whether it's Anita Hill or 
Susan Docheuc, or even some- 
one from your neighborhood, 
we've all heard of these cases. 

It's something that affects 
every one of us. How many of 
you know someone who has 
been, sexually harassed? 
Whether it is female accusing 
male or male accusing female, 
there's a good chance that you 
know someone. 

Why all the problems'? Why do 
men AND women feel the urge 
to voice their opinion about one 
another's sexuality so lewdly? 

Sometimes we should look at 
the way we dress. 

Those women who walk 
around practically naked in biki- 
ni tops and "daisy dukes" should 
not be surprised if men gawk at 
them. Yes, we realize that 
men get hit on too. Wearing 
muscle man lank lops and silk 
jogging shorts could also get a 
whistle from admiring women. 

This is not a gender issue. 

We are not saying that people 
who walk around dressed like 
this deserve to be harassed, but 
they need io take responsibility 
for the way they dress. It is fool- 
ish to expect that you can walk 
out in next to nothing and not be 
stared at. 

People are human and react 
instinctively. There is nothing 
wrong with looking at an attrac- 
tive person. Sexual harassment 
occurs when an individual's self- 
esteem is undermined by 
UNWANTED verbal or non-ver- 
bal attention. 



What type of message is being 
sent out by someone who dress- 
es in an unusually provocative 
manner? It is very difficult for a 
bystander to determine if atten- 
tion is wanted or unwanted. 

LET THE BYSTANDER 
BEWARE! 

The only person who can deter- 
mine if something is wanted or 
unwanted is the person receiving 
sexual attention. Therefore this 
person is the only one who can 
determine if she or he is being 
sexually harassed 

Silence is consent. 

If we do not make our feelings 
known when someone is violat- 
ing us verbally or non-verbally, 
we arc not taking responsibility 
for ourselves. We need to prac- 
tice the an of communication. If 
someone offends you personally, 
let them know. 

So just remind yourself that the 
next time you feel the urge to 
bark comments at that foxy man 
or woman, you need to think 
twice about it. Do those com- 
ments really need to be heard? 
Would you like it if someone 
addressed you in that manner? 

Let's go back to the time when 
it was okay to say, "Hey, you 
look nice today," instead of, 
"Woof, oh, you sexy mama, it's 
sure shakin' with you 'cause 
you've got it going on. Come 
over here so 1 can examine you 
the way I know you want me 
to"! 

It's okay io have manners. 
People will respect you for thai. 
Let's make sure that ihe things 
we do are in good taste, and 
leave the barking to Ihe dogs.

Dean responds to child care argument 



Dear Editor 
I felt it was appropriate to respond to 
the article appearing in the October 14 
Communicator concerning child c 



think the 
explain tbe cui 
regard to the con 
problem by the c 



,cle did i 



t fully 
vith 



for the cbild care 
IPFW communi- 
faculty and stu- 
dents. Nor did it inform the students of 
all of the currcnl work being undertak- 
en lo find a solution for child care. 
Last year a Child Care Task Force was 
established to make recommendations 
about tbc cbild care situation after 
IPFW's withdrawal from the Cbild 
Care Consortium. In March of 1993, 
the Task Force recommended tbe fol- 
lowing; 

1 A Child Care referral Service be 
established to locate child care open- 
ings for students in cbild care centers 



and in licensed homes. A budget was 
formulated and Student Government 
generously funded the project Tbe 
director was hired by the IPFW admin- 
istration and the service established in 
the Center for Women and Returning 
Adults. To date over 100 contacts bavc 
been made with agencies in the area 
and all openings have been posted for 
students. It was also recommended dial 
the service include the development of 
a babysitting co-op. which may be 
implemented in the future. 

2. A cbild care consultant can be hired 
to complete a comprchet 



r-.ulrai 



s beei 



located and tbe assessment will be 
completed yet ibis semester or early 
during the spring 1994 semester 
Again, Student Government generous- 
ly funded the consulting services. Tbe 
reason this recommendation came forth 



was that a needs assessment was con- 
ducted by the task force which showed 
that the child care needs for IPFW stu- 
dents were so diverse that we could not 
possibly provide the needs of the stu- 
dents indicated! The survey further 
indicated that 85% of those surveyed 
last spring were satisfied with their 
child care arrangements. Because the 
response to that survey was so modest. 
we felt we had not even scratched the 
surface of the child care needs of our 
students. 

3. Efforts to continue usage of the 
EduCare Center be pursued for our 
students. Dr Frank Borclli met with the 
administration of Parkview Hospital 
and they agreed to continue to provide 
services for IPFW students on a space 
available basis. We realize that many 
students cannot afford tbc EduCare 
Center, but it is only one of Ihe many 



5 being made available to stu- 






4. Tbc Task Force be continue to fol- 
low up on all of these recommendations 
and to come forth with some solutions 
after the consultant has made recom- 

Thc issues of providing affordable 
child core to meet the diverse needs of 
our student body an: very complicated. 
Concerns of space and financing are 
high on the list However, the IPFW 
administration and the student leader- 
ship arc both very concerned and inter- 
ested in finding solutions. 

I would appreciate bearing and ideas 
from students, faculty and staff.

Dean of Students

Students must learn to quiet down in class 



Dear Editor, 

Recently, 1 was sitting in a rather dif- 
ficult class when the instructor came in 
and began to lecture. Most of the class 
didin't acknowledge his presence even 
as be began talking and writing on the 
board. Their voices were distracting to 
me and others who were trying to lis- 
ten. I had to concentrate bard to bear all 
parts of the lecture fearing I might miss 
something Learning is important, col- 



lege is expensive, and lime is much too 
valuable to waste class time talking 
with friends. 
Learning is very important, especially 
when you have to have a college educa- 
tion in order to get a decent job. People 
who talk through class aren't learning 
anything. They are also keeping others 
from learning. They don't understand 
bow important learning is. 

College is a great expense. Most peo- 
ple don't have any kind of money to 



tpend. For those people that do have 
the privilege to attend college, they 
should make the most of it and do their 
very best. lassume that the "talkers" 
don't care about the money, either 
someone else is paying their way or 
they're just plain rich. 
Time is very valuable. People who 
can talk throughout their classes with- 
out paying attention must have lots of 
extra time on their hands. They must 
have so much extra time to study 



longer for what they've missed during 

Next lime you feel like talking with 
friends during class, please refrain. 
Remember, others are in the class who 
want io leam. They don't have money 
to waste, and their time is much too 
valuable.

University singer rallies for Music department chair 



To tbe Editor: 

The death of John Loessi (Former 
director, University Singers) dealt a 
tragic blow to IPFW's Music depart- 
ment. However, we cannot think of 
anyone better to replace him than Dr. 






John Taylor. 

Dr. Taylor is one of Ihe m 
sional people we have ev 
among University facultyâ€” 

with a tremendous knowledge of his 
subject and gifted with the presentation 
of that subject that is beneficial (o his 



students. 

While he is also a very personable 
man, I &gt;\ Taylor has exhibited none of 
the lewd behavior he is accused of in 
Tennessee. It is sad and embarrassing 
not only to him but also to the Music 
Department that such charges were 



published. 
Let it be known that Dr. John 

Taylor has our thoughts and support 

at this time. 

Jeanne Kachuck 

Member of IPFW University Singers 



IPFW students show support for Professor John Taylor 



To the Editor 



oiled i

the unfounded accusations and misin- 
formation quoted about IPFW Music 
Chair Dr. John E. Taylor. We are dis- 
appointed that our student newspaper 
finds it necessary to print such ques- 



tionable and unfounded informatio 
regarding professional members of the 
university faculty. We question why 
this topic is so attractive to our 
Univeristy newspaper in lieu of issues 
and topics of real importance to the 
reoden in tbe univeristy cooinmunity. 
We support Dr. Taylor and all Ibe 



wonderful attributes he brings tt

Fol left's bookstore needs competition 



Dear Editor, 

I was silting in Kcldcr's lounge, read- 
ing the staff editorial of the Scptemba-9, 
1993 Communicator. The editorial was 
about Follctt's employees not returning 
after the bomb threat. A student need- 
ed a book and called Follct's ahead of 
time to see if they had the book and 



how 



1 BftCl 



she 



arrived at Kc tiler, tbe police released 
tbc people to go back into Ihe building 
at their own risk. When the student 
arrived at Follclls, the lights were out 
and tbc doors locked. She. along with 
several others, waited to see if Follctt's 
would reopen. It did not. Other students 
went to see if they could find anyone Io 
reopen ibe store, 



Obviously this student needed Ibe 
book, and a special trip was made for it. 
If there was another bookstore, she and 
the other studelns could have traded or 
bought their books somewhere else 
besides Follels. This is one of Ihe many 
reasons why there should be anolheer 
bookstore ihat carries IPFW's books. 
Another reason is that Follels bos no 
competition. Tbey can close when they 
want to. They con limit ihe amount of 
money on your returned books. They 
also could raise the prices if they wont 
to. I have heard some of the complaints 
by students oboul the high prices of the 
books. The student who could not get 
the book made a comment that tbc 
book that was Io be bought was an 
"astronomical S50.00 " 



monopoly on IPFW's 

thing must be done. 



Tbe only solution is that tbcre should Folic 
be another bookstore on or off campus book: 
tbat also handles IPFW's books. It 
could be an established bookstore Jason Glassbum, IPFW Student 
willing to explore a new market.

Smoke screen unnecessary

Dear Editor, 

Today the country is going smoke 
free. People are finally realizing 
the hazards of smoXing. There are 
still some who have not caught on 
yet, however. Unfonunanily, 
most of them sit in front of Kettler 
doors in between classes. 

Smokers have the right to smoke. 
If they would like to blacken their 
lungs and lessen their chances of 
living long lives then they have 
that right. But when forcing upon 
others something that should be a 
personal decision, they ruin not 
only their own health, but the 



health of others around them. 

It would be all right if they could 
find a different pake to smoke, but 
they just create a smoke screen 
when they sit in front of the doors. 

One day, after my 1:30 class, I 
was walking down the steps to 
leave. The day was beautiful, and 
I couldn't wait to get out and enjoy 
it. As I opened the door to go out, 
however, the smoke hit me. It was 
like there was someone standing 



there, blowing smoke in my face. 
It was awful. I couldn't breathe. 
I think that smokers should real- 
ize that they are endangering the 
health of those who exit and enter 
those doors. My suggestions to 
these people are: try to stop smok- 
ing for your sake, but if that is not 
possible, find a place that you and 
your cigarette can be alone.

Aunt Louise chats about life 

on Ihe gossip on everyone and all, I just 
love it. She's jast a dear, dear, dear 
friend of mine. 

What you need to do is realize that 
your best friend is going her own sepa- 
rate way. No matter what it is happen- 
ing. It is painful. So. just get out there 
and make new friends. Who knows, you 
may find another best friend. 

Your loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 



You are tbe only I feel can talk to about 
this issue. There is this guy that I work 
with that I find very attractive. 1 think he 
has tbe same feelings for me, but I'm not 
sure. He docs some things that I find he 
only does to me. I don't know if this is a 
signal that he finds me attractive or just 
a coincidence. 

I would like to find out if ibis person is 
interested in mc. but I am afraid because 
I have been hurl before in the past by 
guys. You sec there was this one guy I 
like who wis coming off a relationship 
and I pushed too hard. So. be got scared 
and backed away from mc. I would hate 
for this to happen lo me with this person 
because I think he could really be Ihc 
one I've been wailing for. 

What should I do? 

Caught up in the Rapture 
Dear Caught up in the Rapture, 

It sounds lo mc that you have gotten 
over this first guy, but you're slill trying 
to heal from the pain of being rejected 
Look, dove. I do not believe you were 
rejected. Il was a case of you being al 
the right place at the wrong time. 

Honey, you have several choices: You 
can ignore bim, let him make Ihc first 
move, or you tan moke the first move 
Now, if I were you, I would sit hack and 
for bim to do some more things in

Dear Aunt Lot 

I have o problem. My best friend and I 
arc not really communicating. We've 
been friends for about two years. 
However, ' since she dropped out of col- 
lege here al IPFW wo have gone our 
separalc ways. I hate to say il bul I think 
'we arc growing apart. We have vowed to 
be "friends for life," but I don't think 
that is going to happen. 

What should I do? I hove tried every- 
thing to keep our friendship together, bul 
I don'l she really cares. 

Friendless for Life 

Dear Friendless for Life, 

I'm sorry to sec that your friendship is 
dissolving. Sugar plum, what you need 
to understand is thai people change. We 
all do. Il is a bard part of life to accept, 
but it happens. That's whal sound like is 
happening between you and your besl 

I'm proud to say that my besl friend. 
Cbarloltc, have been besl friends for the 
pail fifty years. We met when I was in 
high school. 1 slill call her up to catch up 



Chester T. Fox gets fan mail 



Tune in some lime to Channel 55 
WFFT "Happy's Place" and pay 
close attention to tbe character of 
"Chester T.Foit." 

Coincidenially, this is IPFW's own 
Paul Moring.. who plays Chester TV 
when be is not performing bis dual 
role of pboto editor for ihis newspa- 
per. 

Since they already had a character 
named "Froggy," Moring did some 
research and found out that foÂ»es eat 
frogs, so when be auditioned for the 
part, he won il bands down. "I played 
off the fox's natural tendency of eat- 
ing frogs." said Moring. The slaff 
liked his ingenuity. 

His major is Radio Television and 
Film and began working for Channel 
55 in Ibe Fall of 1991. and has been 
performing this dual role ever since. 
He went from Ihe film department as 
a a production assistant, to lelccinc, 
to his present job as on air talent. He 
is known as a very well-rounded assel 
al Channel 55. 

When asked if he would like lo step 
inio Happy's shoes some day, Moring 
responded fervently "1 ffin'l crazy!" 
"I am on the show strictly to help oul 



way\ Now, we also wanl lo hope thai he 
is reading this column because if so I 
suggest lhat Ihis young man take Ihe 
step and approach you. You seem like a 
nice person who is willing to give a 
relationship one-hundred and ten pcr- 

If he doesn't make the first move, if 
you think you have enough confidence 
lo make Ihc first move yourself, I sug- 
gest you go for it. If be doesn't sec 
you're worth Ibe time, forgel about 
him! You'll find someone! 

Your loving Aunt Louise 



Happy' as much as possible," said 
Moring. 

"Most of tbe kids respond very well 
to Chester, but some kids arc afraid," 
said Moring. "They realize it is just 
enicrtainmcni." 

Moring also receives fan mail each 
week, mostly colored pictures. Often 
they are pictures of Chester. 

"Happy's Place is geared toward 
education and we teach the kids how 
to be compeiive in games," Moring 
explained. 

"It is al a deeper level rather than 
just reading a book for one hour," 
added Moring. 

Some of Ihe gomes the kids play are 
bucket loss, Happy says (which is 
like Simon says) and ring loss. 

Eacb week is a different game. "If 
Ihe shoe fits, wear il" teaches Ihe kids 
how to lie Iheir shows. They have to 
throw their shoes up in the air, catch 
them and tie their laces. 

Happy's Place airs Monday through 
Friday from 3:30 to 5 p.m. Shows arc 
taped on Thursday for the entire 
week and tickets for Ihe show are 
free. Taping one show takes aboul 1- 

1/2 hours Kids receive a "Happy 
sack" filled with goodies, such as 
colored pictures. 
Moring will soon appear live as 

Chester T. Fox at tbe Old Fort on 

Halloween evening at 6:30 p.m. lo 

pass oul candy to the children. 



Improvement 

No more negative thinking 



Do you feel sometimes as if you could 
snap? Or the thought of facing a 
Monday morning has you down? 

A group of evening studenis are learn- 
ing how to cope with their negative 
thoughts and adjust their reactions as 
they work their way through a new 
class entitled "You Can't Afford the 
Luxury of Negative Thoughts" being 
offered the Office of Continuing 
Education. 

The four-week session started Oct. 6 
and ends Oct. 27 and is being held in 
the Walb Memorial Union Ballroom on 
Wednesday nigbts fromi7:30-9:30 pm., 
and is loosely based on the book "You 
Can'l Afford Ihe Luxury of Negative 
Thoughts", co-authored by John Rogers 
and Peter McWilliams. 

Tbe book teaches bow lo regain per- 
sonal freedom by controlling your 
mind, and to take charge of your 
thoughts, beliefs and actions. 

Taught by Joann Snow, she is trying 
to show how we all get inlo negative 
mind sets and that il is addictive. Her 
students arc learning where these 
thoughts come from whether, family or 

"It's exciting that people are interested 
in the way they thing", said Snow, 



This is the first time this class has 
been offered and a total of 69 people 
signed up for the class. 

For the fust two weeks, her students 
identified 10 words to eliminate from 
their vocabulary by keeping a nole- 

The last two weeks of the class 

involve changing thought paltems from 
negative lo positive. Breathing exercis- 
es, such as Yoga are performed. Pass- 
outs are given lo reinforce positive 
thinking. 

"Your inner critic tells you that you 
are never good enough." said Snow. 

She illustrated the example of "fight 
or flight syndrome", where adrenaline 
is released when we are faced with this 



"This is counter-productive. In the 

released by running away from danger 
and this alleviated tbe physical condi- 
tion," said Snow. 
In today's environment, it is no! prac- 
tical lo run away to release the hor- 

"How many times have you been dri- 
ving in your car, and someone cuts you 
off and you can't do anything aboul il. 
except to get angry?." said Snow. 

These "tapes" arc replayed over and 
become ingrained inlo negative 
thinking.
