workshop will be held from 
noon-l;lS p,m, in Walb

Sheila Leonard from

the discussion and will cover 
ihe importance of establish- 
ing boundaries in relation- 
ships and Ideniif) some of 
the stereotypical trails of 
daie-rapisu, according to 
Ben Gates, director of 
Campus Ministry. "This is a 
veo' Important subject thai 
needs lo be addressed," said 

Leonard, who also works 
with area high school stu- 
dents and youth groups, said 

one in eight men between 
the ages of IS and 24 will 
experience a sexual assault. 
"If s Important lo realize that 



aid Leonard. 

"We'll start out the pres- 
entation with a short video 
clip of a scene which shows 
the prelude lo a date rape." 
said Leonard. 

After the video, the 
group will discuss the need 
to establish health) bound- 
aries in relationships and 

tics. "People have to realize 
that the more often a person 
appears on the list of abusive 
characteristics, the greater 
the chances are that he or 
she tna) become abusive," 
said Leonard. 

Ifonard also plans to 
discuss the consequences of 
rape and cover the healing 
process. "This will not onlj 
help women who have been 
raped to belter deal with the 
situation, but alio to teach 
people bow to help others 
who ma)' have been phjsi- 
caily, verbally, mentall) or 
sexually abused." said 
Leonard. 

According lo Leonard, 
dale rape is a great problem 
in Fort Wa)-ne. Information 
Ihat Leonard obtained from 
the Fort Wayne Se.xual 
Assault Treatment Center 



indicates that 118 people 
reported having been sexual- 
ly assaulted in 199S. Of the 
H8, 98 percent were female. 
Twenty percent of thc 
females were ages lS-17; 34 
percent were 18-25; and 44 
percent were 2&amp;-49. Leonard 
added that according to the 
FBI, onl) 10 tol7 percent of 
rapes are actuall)' reported. 

Fort Wayne Sexual 
Assault Treatment Center 
statistics Indicate 37 percent 
of all reported sexual 
assaults in 1998 were by 
strangers, white 47 percent 
were made b) acquaintanc- 
es. Seven percent of the 
reported assaults were made 
b) ex-relatlonship partners. 
Information also indicated 
Ihat 50 percent of the vic- 
tims had used drugs or alco- 
hol immediately before thc 
assault, compared to only 41 
percent of thc offenders. 

"The best prevention ii

the things that they have

The example of

one mentioned 
that King had had an 
affair during the 1960s 
when he was at the 
nation's forefront with 
the civil rights cause. 1 
normally overlook things 
which aren't backed up 
with proof that I only 
hear once, but I heard 
this tale again not long 

to date. We only 
heard these claims and 
have neicr seen anj thing 
published about them, 
bul whether they 




iffair with one of his

like 10 think I'd never let 
something so trivial as

Whether Jefferson 
was right or wrong to 
completely deny die alle-

though. Again, 1 think It 
probably was important 
to the ivoman i\iih whom 
he was having the affair 



and I've no doubt it \va 
to their children, but 
don't even think that hi 
having an affair should 
have been a big deal tc

New definition 
of happiness 

by Kerrin Lang ford, 
Staff Wriler 

Is our definition of -happiness" chang- 
ing? The year 2000 is here and the nevt turn 
of events is rolling along, as If it were busi- 
ness as usual. Perhaps we should pause and 
rethink our path to the pursuit of happiness. 
Are we following a path unlike the one 
Corporate America and ad\crti!ers suspect 
we do7 

According to man) futuristic authors, 
such as Kenneth Hey and Peter Moore, these 
entities confLdcntl) spelling out our tastes, 
desires and needs through the media are oft 
track. He) and Moore depict this phenome- 
non in their book "The Caterpillar Doesn't 
Know." However, businesses systematica 1 1] 
running after their common goal of profit do 
noiseem to thinkso. 

The question must be asked: Do we still 
onlj care about material things and are we 
looking forward to worUng Hio jobs to feed 
this -me-ism" habit? To these and other 
scholars' dismaj, apparently we do not and 1 
tend to agree. For once, I understand wh)' 
advertisers miss the boat when It comes to 
Generations X and Y. 

The bad rap Generation X received car- 
ried widi it the stigma we did not like to work, 
whined and were othenvise rude. 
Additionally, Generation Y is known b) mar- 
keters and the like as being ovcrl) optimistic, 
spcnd-happy and verv' impulsive. 

What do ihey really know, any-waj-? It Is 
true, and many trends such as the youth 
avoiding the voting booths shoiv Americans 
disenfranchised. Furthermore, these groups 
of -status quo" breakers are joining smaller 
companies in place of corporate giants. 
Perhaps this is because wc witnessed parents 
being laid off, in addition to being brought 
up during a lime when the divorced emotion- 
al roller coaster was the most popular ride at 
the family fair. 

Our dcilnlilon of happiness docs not 
encompass advertisers' false assumptions. I 
believe wc do not follow our 'BOs parents' 
footsteps that lead to lusting after material 
objects which idealize sex appeal. 1 believe we 
will not blindl) subscribe to the ideal of work- 
ing until death do us part, for that golden egg 
of wealth. 

Instead, ihe quest to lead a balanced and 
meaningful life begins to surface and this is 
what is driving marketers cniz) . Our genera- 
don, more than anj other, knows the might 
behind communities of meaning, such as 
spirituality, personal growth and skill devel- 
opment through learning. This can oniv help 
i become more powerful behind ihe'burks 

The two types of changes that Hey and 
oore coined as cyclical and secular point to 
lis neiv trend that the* predict will take 
place in 10-1 5 ) ears. The secular is a shift in 
ultut^l environment surrounding the econo- 
m, while C)dical is indicative of the tradi- 
tional economic model. As man) of us know, 
economics can help one predict breaks in tra- 
ditional patterns. 

It is not so much that we are rejecting the 
material things in life that leads Ihem to 
believe we are searching for a different 
lifestyle than our parents arc. Apparently, 
difflculi) in raising prices and cutting rri*o- 
lous pontons of a compan) (such as hair 
products) are signs of this. 

In addition, often touted by our politi- 
cians arc the booming market and low unem- 
plojmeni. HoMC^-cr, that does not case the 
income squeeie. Another point that led them 
to believe wc are heading for a more mean- 
ingful path is the fact that man) Americans 
feel the world is out of conrrol. Hc)- and 
Moore coin this as -psjchic shock" which 
leads us to rethink who we arc, what we 
believe in and what our trui* needs are. 

They do admit that they cannot know 
where these individual changes in behavior 
will take us. I believe this is why their book 
makes a comparison to the caterpillar. Thus, 
unaware of the changes to follow, the cater- 
pillar becomes a butterfly. 

We no longer need to fear the negative 
news in the media. According to Hey and 
Moore, this is a sign of the breakdown in old 
di the new replacing the old.

many of the decorations In the

great success, there is always 
the good chance of a sequel 
to follow not too far behind. 
That is the scenario )du get 
with Pi,\ar's 'To) Storj Z," 
coming straight off the suc- 
cess of the original. Sure, 
some maj say that -Toj 
Storj 2" is onlj for children 
(after all, it is a Walt Disnej 
film), but as I looked around 
the movie theater Salurda&gt; 
night, I noticed that there 
were more adulLs than there 
were children, Majbe it's the 
technology, the animation or 
the voices behind the charac- 
ters. Or ma&gt;bc it is all three 
that draws audiences of all 



, the 



luntn- I 



"Toy Story 1' introduces 
the audience to new- charac- 
ters along with re-introduc- 
ing us to the characters from 
the previous movie. 'Toy 
Story 2" also continues the 
story line of friendship and 

TTie toy crew- is back for 
more hilarious adventures in 
"Toy Start- 2" This includes 
Woody (Tom Hanks), Butt 
Lighijear (Tim Allen), cranky 
Mr, Potato Head (Don 
Rickles), Slinky Dog (Jim 
Varney), the disturbed Re\ 
(Wallace Shawn). self- 
assured Hamm (John 
Ratzenberger) and the rest of 
the group from toy owner 

This timfe around. 
Woody Is pumped up to go to 
camp with his owner Andy 
until a np In his righl arm 
prevents him from going and 
he is placed on the shelf. 



While Andy is gone, his mom 
has a yard sale, sending shiv- 
ers of panic throughout the 
toy community. Wheezy the 
Penguin, who has been sit- 
ting on the same shelf since 
he lost his squeak, is placed 
into the 25-cent tox. When 
Wood) \-entures outside to 
the sale to rescue Wheezy, 
toyshop owner Al McWhlggln 
(Waj-ne Knight) kidnaps him. 

Il turns out thai Woody 
was a big star of an old 1950s 
show called "Woody's 
Roundup,' which the audi- 
ence gets to vicH throughout 
the movie. Also on this shoi&gt; 
was the spirited cowgirl 
Jessie (Joan Cusack), Bullseje 
the Horse and Stinky Pet (he 
Prospector. 

Now, with Woody found, 
the "Roundup" group is 
ready to be placed In a toy 
museum in Japan. Wood)- 
has to choose between seek- 
ing to return lo his buddies 
or staying with this 
'Roundup' gang. If Woody 
decides to go back lo his bud- 
dies, the stars of -Roundup- 
will be placed back into stor- 
age again. Meanwhile, Buiz 
and the other toys set out 
downtown to rescue Woody. 

The adventures the toys 
have along the way provide 
laughs, gasps and a few tears. 
For example, a scene of the 
toys facing the dreaded idea 
of crossing a busj street 
underneath orange cones, 
besides being absolutely 
hilarious, gives the audience 
the sense of how frightening 
the world would look to toys. 
The detail given to facial 
evprcssiont is constant 
throughout the movie. It's 
not Just that there's technical 
expertise at work, but contin- 
ual obser\atlon by those 
making the movie. 

Direclor John Lasseter 



and his crew of artisls have 
spent three years on this fol- 
low-up script of love and 
laughter. This script is full of 
sass&gt; quips and believable 

deals with the issues of loyal- 
ty, rejection, pride and the 
poner of friendship. It's 
great in Its references to 
movies such as "Star Wars" 
when the evil Emperor Zurg 
said to Buzz, "Buzz, I'm your 
father,- The movie also 
shows the tojs themselves at 
pla). For e.'samplc, when the 
tojs are driving a car 
around the lo) store while in 
search for Woody , the} find 
Barbie and her friends ha4- 
ing a pool part}. 

"Toy Storj 2" is a movie 
for all ages. It gives the audi- 
ence a chance to make new- 
friends wlih the "Roundup" 
gang and continue a friend- 
ship with the characters from 
Andj's room. This movie 
shows that just because you 
make new- friends does not 
mean that you have to give 
up jour old ones. Instead, 
they are able to be part of the 
friendship circle as well and 
experience once again the 
love a person can give. 

Composer Randy 
Newman shows his talent In 
making the music. For cam- 
ple, Jessie's song 'When She 
Loved Me.' sung bj Sarah 
McLachlan, will reach down 
and pull at the heartstrings. 
There is also the rcoccurring 
song 'You've Got a Friend In 
Me,"
