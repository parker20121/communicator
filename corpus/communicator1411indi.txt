chairman of the student branch here at 
IPFW is Steve Strandlund. 

"The SAE is a professional 
engineering group that feels that Ihey 
have responsibility for design con- 
siderations, recommendations and 
safety evaluations ot vehicles that are 
used on land, air. sea or space, they 
cover ihe field rather completely," 
McAleecc said. 

Thestudentswhoare members of Ibe 
SAE are given all of the membership 
privileges of Ihe professional members. 
The studenls go lo all of the monthly 
meetings, go on field trips and go to Ihe 
yearly national meeting. 

"Because of the monthly meetings we 
can make

learn a lot about Industry through the 
SAE. and they are planning several 
field Irips this year. 

October 12 there was a tractor pull al 
the Commons between Helmke Library 
and the Walb Memorial Union, Ken 
Bullemeir and Sieve Crosby who are 
both of the National Tractor Pullers 
Association were demonstrating how

charged fuel injecled bug block chevy- 
type rodac motor and Crosby had a 
super-charged fuel injected small block 
chevy motor. They also answered 
questions. 

Strandlund made special mention of 
the Alarm Clock race, he said that the 
adult group was sponsoring the Alarm 
Clock Cash Haul with the winner 
winning «00 in Susan B. Anthony

"It is very seldom lhat the student*

Ihey put into what they are doing. The 
student designs It, builds It, testa it, 
then races it," McAJeece said Any 
student in the technical field can enter. 

SAE students have a y, yearly

"Automotive Engineering." 
This also Includes being able to go to the

certain events throughout the year. The 
students find out what is going on Id

There are presently 55 members on

opinion 



Value of education 
should be higher 



In the fall of 1380, a student had 
$8655 for a three credit hour class at 
IPFW. One year later, that cost, thought 
to be expensive then, jumped to $97.35 
Don't look now, but IPFW students are 
now paying SI 11.90 for a three credit 
claps If you think (hat's bad, there is the 
possibility student fees could be even 
higher next year now that Purdue 
University, IPFW's fiscal agent, 
projected a six percent fee increase for 
its students, based on the expected rate 
of inflation. 

With the mess the Elate budget and 
overall economy are in, it's no wonder 
students are paying more tuition. The 
state can't contribute as much as It used 
to. so the universities have to make up 
for the reduced slate funds by charging 
more from the students. 

Faced with a $25 increase per three 
hour class in Just the past two years, how 
can students be expected to shoulder an 
even larger percentage of Ihe burden 1 " 

Many experts would say the answer 
lies in dealing with inflation. This is nol 
an editorial about inflation, however, bul 
one about the valuation of higher 



education. 

Since the state budget is in a bind, the 
state is looking for agencies that can do 
with less money Higher education 
should be a high priority in the eyes of 
the slate legislature. 

Colleges and universities are training 
students to be thinking, productive in- 
dividuals. A co liege- trained mind can 
help solve the economic crunch Indiana 
is in or bring high technology industries 
to Fort Wayne. 

Col lege- trained men and women can 
help provide for a belter future for the 
country, but, they can'l go to college if 
they can'l afford it. 

If cuis in higher education continue, 
colleges and uni vers Hies will see a 
decrease in enrollment. A university Is 
like any other business in that it must 
make money A decrease in enrollment 
would mean less business and less 
money for the university — leaving the 
college unable lo provide the learning 
resources it once did. 

By continuing lo cut funds to higher 
education, the state is only cheating 
itself out of its own future.
