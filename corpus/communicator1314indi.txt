Poor counseling 
haunts registration 



Although it's been mare than a month 
since Halloween, some of (he scariest 
stories of the year are now circulating 
(he IPFW campus. 

The subject of the stories'" Academic 
counseling. 

While the IPFW system of registration 
is set up so that each student receives 
counseling before enrolling each semes- 
ter, the amount and quality of (he 
counseling varies — from precise 
planning that leads a student loa degree 
with equal- difficulty semester loads, to a 
reasonable amount of guidance thai 
provides the student with choices, but 
docs not always prevent mistakes In 
planning, lo poor advice that hinders (he 
progress of Ihe student by misplacement 
in unneeded classes. 

The crux of ihe problem seems to be in 
the fact that not all counselors are 
adequately prepared lo counsel, nor take 
Ihe job of counseling seriously. 

One studcnl lold us he went In for his 
usual pro-registration counseling 
session and was greeted with "Have you 
got your schedule ready? OK, let me 
sign II I've got another appointment " 

The counselor then signed Ihe 
schedule, and the student went on to 
rcglslcr, only lo learn later he had 
enrolled In iwo unneeded courses. 

Another student said she would be 
graduating soon, bul because of poor 
counseling, she would have 152 hours lo 
her credit instead of just the 126 needed 
in her mojor, 

Still other students have cited In- 
■ i.i ! i &gt; of being enrolled i 
prerequisites required when they 
haven't laken Ihe prerequisites, or being 
placed in the second half of a [w» 



semester course when they haven't 
taken the first half. 

Although we realize mistakes can be 
made by even the most careful and 
caring counselors because of the 
numbers of students processed each 
semester, we believe the administration 
should take a long look at (he counseling 
process here. 

Nearly every IPFW professor coun- 
sels a number of students, regardless of 
(he professor's ability, aptitude, or 
desire lo counsel. Most have not had 
[raining in counseling, and few of them 
want lo counsel students Bui, because 
counseling is "expected" of (hem. (hey 
doit. 

The losers in ihis ill-managed coun- 
seling process are not only the students 
who waste lime, money and efforts 
because or poor course planning; the 
university also loses because students 
become frustrated by their lack of 
progress toward degrees, become 
disenchanted with IPFW, and seek other 
universities at which (hey are be(ter 
counseled. 

We believe students have the righl lo 
be counseled by someone who knows the 
requirements of a student's major, who 
has Ihe lime lo discuss the sludenl's 
goals and needs, and who has been 
trained (o prepare schedules that 
progress the student toward Ihose goals. 

The problem of inadequate academic 
counseling must be solved by the ad- 
ministration for Ihe good of us all, and 
ask (he administration lo hasten its 
investigation into alternatives fo the 
present counseling system haunting 
IPFW.

was Ihe huge amount of
