Controversia 

By Allison Graber 

On Tuesday, Oct. 17, Seymour 
Hersh spoke in the IPFW Walb Ball- 
room for the Omnibus Lecture Series. 
He gave his perspective on the war in 
Iraq and criticized the government's 
foreign policy. 

Hersh was not afraid to speak his 
mind, with harsh words for both politi- 
cal ponies. 

After giving Bush the name "King 
George II" and mentioning that he is 
counting down the days until Bush will 
be out of office, Hersh accused Demo- 
crats of "blathering" about whether or 
not the United States should get out of 

Hersh, winner of the Pulitzer Prize 
for his coverage of a massacre during 
the Vietnam War, referred to his inves- 
tigation in Vietnam as well as his re- 
porting on soldiers' abuse of prisoners 
u Ghraib prison in Iraq. 



IPFW Prof Creates Masterpiece 



"Transformation," a sculpture in 
front of the new Allen County Juvenile 
Center by IPFW Professor Emeritus 
Hector Garcia, was recently dedicated 
in a ceremony led by county commis- 
sioner Linda Boom .nut iiidge Stephen 
M. Sims. 

Garcia, who taught sculpture and 
figure drawing at IPFW from 1976 
until 1997, said the inspiration for his 
bronze masterpiece was a combination 
of things. 

"[The goal was] to create a sculp- 
ture that would make a statement based 
on children, handguns, and violence." 

The artwork was commissioned by 
Dr. Rudy and Rhonda Kachmann and 
symbolizes the transformation of the 
world by generating peace through re- 
solving conflicts and putting an end to 
violence. 

"I was able to take from that nega- 
tive and create a positive," Garcia said 
ol his creation. "I'm very grahlied that 
take part i 



The 1 4-foot sculpture, which 
was donated to Allen County by the 

Kachmanns and the Kachmann Behav- 
ioral Foundation, is adorned by two 
ten-foot panels of granite on each side 
and at the top, features a dove as a rep- 
resentative of peace and tranquility. 

Dr. Rudy Kachmann. a well-known 
neurosurgeon, is also the author of 
"The Call of Life." which features 20 
Prescriptions lor Living the Good Life. 
a list of sueycsliniiN that promote char- 
acter development, good lie.tllh habits 
and peace, as well as spiritual, cultural, 
and racial diversity. At the request of 
Dr. Kachmann, the 20 Prescriptions 
appear on the two granite panels offer- 
ing such advice as "be honest." "treat 
others as you would like to be treated," 
respect (he environment." and "be tol- 
erant of other's beliefs." 

Professor Garcia said that the 
Kachmanns. who are philanthropist 
in the Fort Wayne community, have a 
program that is quite far-reaching. 

"He is a person who is devoted to 
children in terms of social behavior 
(and wants) to put a dent in the prob- 
lem we have of children getting hand- 
guns." 

Garcia, who received a B.F.A. in 
sculpture from The John Herron Insti- 
tute in Indianapolis, a M.F.A. from In- 
diana University, and has done scholar- 
ship work in Mexico, first taught at the 
Fort Wayne Art Institute before coming 
to IPFW. He is a nationally and inter- 
nationally-recognized sculptor who 
has created medallions for award cer- 
emonies in Finland, Japan, Germany, 
Poland and England. Celebrities such

Jgeti 



ACELINK und the Mike 
Downs Center for Indiana 
Politics had a virtual town hall 
meeting where they offered a 
discussion last Friday in Kcttlcr 



three have been the topic of dis- 
cussion at several local debates 
including one recently aired on 



Cartoon by Mike Webb 



Schools, as well as Anthis Ca- 
reer Center. Andy Downs was 
aired on the debate moderator. 

The meeting started with 
nvolved Downs asking several qucs- 
Snidcr, tions. followed by each can- 



ave been the 
ir county for 
inly way 
ore offi- 
t and in under- 
cover positions to weed out some 
of ihe dealers," said Smith. 

Downs then gave Tina Tavia- 
no, the Democratic nominee, an 
opportunity to answer. 

"I agree with [Smith] that 
drugs are a huge deal in our coun- 
ty, but 1 also have a passion for 
combating family violence. It is 
vital that we protect people even 
if it is from their own family. The 
best way to stop it is to be proac- 
tive and get our officers trained to 
deal with the issues at hand," said 
Taviano. 

Ken Fries, ihe Republican 



spots on our county's 
crime list. The best solutions 
to those are, like Taviano said, 
to be proactive. When I was on 
third shift, I could catch over 
ten people every night just 
stealing things, and if we keep 
police officers on the street we 
will start to dent those figures." 

The next question was 
asked by a Paul Harding senior 
who wanted to know if Allen 
County was actively fighting 
online predators. 

All three candidates agreed 
that the county was fighting the 
problem and that there are sev- 
eral task forces in place to repel 
online crimes. 

Smith agreed, but added, 
"Within the last month, one of 
our teams cracked an online 
crime ring where thieves were 
stealing from retail stores in 
large quantities and selling the 
items on eBay. We aggressive- 
ly do all we can to stop online 
predators of any sort." 

A question from a Leo stu- 
dent brought about a heated 
exchange; however, in the end, 



The question prompting the 
scuffle was whether or not the 
candidates would support a law 
to prohibit drivers under the 
age of 18 from talking on cell 
phones. 

Fries went first and quickly 
responded with. "If there were 
to be a law such as that, I feel 
that all drivers should have to 
give up cell phone usage while 
driving." 

Smith and Taviano agreed. 

The candidates all had nu- 
merous reasons why they felt as 
though they should be elected 
sheriff, but when asked what 
sets them apart from the other 
contenders, they each look a 

Taviano is fully set on solv- 
ing issues with family violence 
and combining the county and 
city headquarters. 

Fries stands firm on his be- 
lief that a sheriff should be a 
leader and that his 24 years with 
the police departments gives 
him that qualification, 

Lastly, Smith explained how 
he is the middle man and can 
agree with either the Democrat 
or Republican.

I love Halloween. 1 adore it I think 

winter. Moreover though, I love that, 
for a single night, I can wear whatever 
I want and not have anyone say any- 
thing—not to my face at least. 

You know that pan in "Mean Girls?" 
The part where poor little Lindsay Lo- 
han goes to her first Halloween party 
sans the critical information that the 
mantra of any Halloween party is the 
sluttier ... er, sexier ... the better? 

Well, I take full advantage of this 
ideology. Now, don't assume that 1 
walk around in a string bikini a la Gisele 
Bundchen, because I don't. (1 couldn't 
even if I wanted to; her entire body is 
the width of just one of my thighs!) 

1 prefer to practice Safe Costuming, 
SC for short. Let me tell you a little 
bit about SC. SC focuses on know- 
ing what you can wear and what you 

I have absolutely no problem with 
skankifying your costume. More pow- 
er to you, in fact! But, the fundamental 
issue that you must remember is this: 
comfort is key. 

I'm not talking about wearing com- 
fy clothes or shoes. 1 mean, last year. I 
went as Marilyn Monroe from the "The 
Seven Year Itch." 

You know the dress; it's the one 
that everyone wears at least once. Any- 
way, the shoes I wore were horrific. I 




had blisters tot weeks alter only ;i tew 
hours on my feet. But, I had a blast 
and I looked great. (If you don't be- 
lieve me, go to Buffalo Wings and 
Ribs on West Jefferson and look at the 
pictures!) When I talk about comfort 
as it relates to SC, I'm talking about 



being, minion, ihle '" your skin. 

Here's an example for those of 
you who don't know what I'm saying 
(which is completely understandable as 
I don't know what I'm saying half the 
time): a few years ago. I decided iliat I 
was going to channel Rebecca Dc Mor- 



nay in "Risky Business." I was going 
to dress up as a high-dollar callgirl. 

Before you begin to envision nipple 
tassels and the like, please know that I 
emulated her businessman suit. I had 
the pinstripe pants, the tailored while 
shin and the tie. I even had a Inggin' 



fedora. I put on the tallest heels I could 
find. I smudged my eyes with smoky 
eye shadow, slathered on hl.uk liquid 
eyeliner and caked on the mascara. I 
put loose curls in my then-lower-buck- 
leneth h.nr and straightened my gcek- 

When 1 looked in the mirror. 1 re- 
alized that I didn't look like Lana (De 
Moniay's character) at all. Instead, 1 
was giving "Striptease's" Demi Moore 
a run for her money, But, hey, that 
worked for mc. 

1 sashayed up to the house party 
with a little extra oomph. I knew I 
looked hot. And, the best pan, 1 wasn't 
showing any skin — save my face, a 
little decolletage, and my hands, with 
their expertly painted siop-sign-rcd 
nails. I was completely covered. I was 
also comfortable. 

That, in and of itself, added the ex- 
tra swing in my step. Being comfort- 
able made mc even sexier. 

It's this theory lli.il should resonate 
through our daily lives. However, I 
understand how hard this can be on 

Halloween leels like— to me at 
tst — the one day where I can wear 
i skirt and get away with 
it. So this year, in the spirit of my self- 
proclaimed day of freedom, I'm going 
as a Catholic school girl. 

It's cliche", I know. But I used to 
be one, so I might as well capitalize 
on my 10 years of experience. Happy 
Haunting! 



America: Land of the 
Foreign Exchange Student

s and bad leaders. 

eat country. It is a 
great country because of the good peo- 
ple-many of whom come from other 
areas of the world--who call America 

Of course, in a school setting, these 
individuals are known as foreign ex- 
change students. Some came here dur- 
ing their high school years, and others 
came here fresh off the plane to attend 
college. They have worked much hard- 
er than most of us to get to where they 
are, and they must pay as much as five 
times more for school than the average 

Many of these international stu- 
dents have had to perform well despite 
living in war-torn, largely-destitute 
areas. They get good grades, they get 
passports and visas, then they get out. 

IPFW has students from over 30 
, including Vietnam, Nigeria, 



Bangladesh. Burma. Bosnia, and even 
Canada (yes, they count), with the num- 
ber of international enrollees increas- 
ing each year. Many come lo seek op- 
portunities which may not he available 
to them in their homelands. Some want 
to become citizens of America. Others 
may want to take what they leam here 
and bring that knowledge back to their 
birth countries to try and make a differ- 

I believe that diversity and different 
perspectives are what make IPFW bet- 
ter. Our university's campus has many 
different shades of people, who each 
come with very valuable experiences 

They like lo party, they like to shop, 
and they like to go to church just like 
native-born Americans. They are here 
because they still believe, unlike some 
Americans, that this is still a land of 
unlimited opportunities. And they-like 
all of us-are trying lo find those op- 
portunities while enjoying new experi- 
the process. 






Teaching Styles Make or 
Break Classroom Lectures 



We come here every day, we walk 
to our classes and we sit through 50 
minule lectures thai often seem as 
though they lasl 5 minutes or 50 years. 
Do we go through a space/time warp 
where lime slows dimn? Do we enter a 
new level of consciousness? Or is our 
teacher so boring, inept and stupid that 
silling through their class is like sitimg 
in purgatory, with worse lighting? 

Some of us will doodle, check our 
cell phone messages, or sleep until the 
class is over. But once we get out, we 
go to a class that feels like a breeze. 
Everything runs smoothly, everyone is 
participating, and before we leave, we 
actually leam something. One might 
feel glad that they held off on buying 
those spuming nm- lor the Corolla and 
insiead decided lo go lo school. 

What is it that makes a class seem 
shorter or longer? It could be that you 
span. However, 
likely, you ha

of the day on the board and then elabo- 
rate on those concepls. Some will use

into great detail about them, and then

Breaking Up with 
Friends is Allowed 



By Stephanie Samples 



Everyday, I hear another female 
talk about her relationship - what her 
boyfriend did nghi and more of what 
he did wrong. 

Most of us women ask our friends 
for advice about what we should do dif- 
ferently in our relationships. We cry to 
our friends when we are sad. and if we 
are lucky, ihey lell us what to do to feel 

We talk to our friends about our 

relationships, and many limes we de- 
mand thai our boyfriends sit down and 
discuss our relationship until they want 

After being guilty of a few of these 
agonizing lalks, I had a thought - why 
do we spend so much lime discussing 
and trying to change our relationships 
when we are unhappy, but never seem 
lo sit down with our friends and talk 
about our friendships? 

Although we may nol argue about 
ihe same things with our friends as we 
do our boyfriends, friendships arc still 
nol perfect. Sometimes relationships 
end because of unhappiness or because 
the person is just not right for you. So, 
if we break up with our boyfriends, is it 
ever necessary to "break up" wilh our 
friends? 

Now, I know there are a few very 
obvious reasons for ending a friend- 
ship. Sharing a very private secret or 
being involved with someone you are 
dating are obvious deal breakers But 
what about Ihe little things'? 

Recently, I have noticed that 1 am 
at an age where some of my friends 
and I are changing. Our goals, mor- 
als, and interests aren't all the same as 
they used to be. This can be hard on a 
friendship, just like vast differences in 
relationships can be difficult. 

As women, we are (old that we 
should put our friends lirst, because 



they will be around longer than our 
boyfriends. Bul is that necessar- 
ily true? Personally, I know that I am 
more forgiving of ihe hurtful things my 
friends do than I am of the things my 
boyfriend does. And I don'l think lhat 

friends' hurtful behavior but give ul- 
timatums to their boyfriends when 
ihey do very similar things. We end 
unhealthy relationships, but how does 
one end an unhealthy friendship. 

Young girls Slop writing BFI- (best 
friends forever) around the age of 11. 
Maybe there is a reason. I think that 
at some point, women realize how long 
forever is, and how il may be unrealis- 
tic to think that these people are going 
lo be around for that amount of time. 

I think we all have to know who we 
are before we can commit to being with 
a significant oilier forever. Maybe thai 
is necessary in friendships, too. 

If women end relationships to save 
themselves from people who might 
hurt them, maybe it is time lo let go of 
hurtful friendships and not forgive so 

I don'l mean to sound morbid or 
anti-friendship. I know I have a few 
friends who will be around for a long 
time. On the other hand, I know 1 have 
a few who hurt me more than they help 
me. I think it is important to realize thai 
we should have just as much respect 
for ourselves in friendships as we try to 
have in relationships. 

Just because you have been friends 
through Barbies, bikes, and boyfriends 
doesn't mean the friendship will last 
forever. That's okay. Recognize that 
we are in a very important time in our 
lives and choose to surround yourself 
with people who will make this time 
even belter - not worse - regardless ol 
whether they are a boyfriend or just a

When a Martin

ruthless crime lord, there will undoubtedly be a 
certain amount of buzz surrounding it. 

But when the great Mr. Nicholson's co-stars 
consist ol Leonardo I JiCaprio Mail Damon. Mark 
Walhberg. Martin Sheen and Alee Baldwin, there 
should be a law against not seeing it. 

So it was that 1 made the rather easy decision 
to review Warner Bros. Picture's "The Depart- 

The premise ol the movie is really quite sim- 
ple: Prank Costcllo I lack Nicholson I is a powerful 
Irish mafia crime lord. He has eves and cars ev- 
erywhere, even within the Boston police depart- 
ment. It is there that he has strategical!;, placed 

Colm Sullivan (Malt D. n in relay information 

back to him. 

Meanwhile, we also have Billy Costigan, an 
unlikely police officer working undercover to 
climb the ranks of Mr. CostclloS mafia branch 
and gam his trust. 

With one rat inside the police and another in- 
side the mafia, tension rises to an all-time high 
and sets the pace for one of the most intelligent 
films to be released as of late. 

If the storyline and cast arc not enough to get 
excited about, the fact that it is directed by Martin 
Scorcese should be. 

This man already has "Goodfcllas," "The 
Aviator," and "Gangs of New York" under his 
belt, and that is just a small fraction of the list. 
Needless to say, Mr Scorcese does noi disappoint 

The acting is absolutely top of the line. So 
much so that it is hard to lind a stand out perfor- 
mance because everyone here shines so brightly 
Malt Damon pulls off a disturbingly likeable and 
suhlle villain as the traitorous Colin Sullivan. 

Leonardo DiCaprio is poised to regain any re- 
spect he may have lost during "Titanic" for the 
passion he displays as the troubled Billy Costi- 
gan. 

Mark Walhberg will have you wishing his role 
was larger as the tonhinoiiihed Dignam, and both 
Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen shine with the 
same class that made them hright stars years ago 

Don't even gel me stalled on Jack Nicholson. 
This man reaffirms why he is a legendary actor 
with his role as the corrupted Frank Costello. who 
will undoubtedly go down as one of the coolest 
and most entertaining villains in movie history. 
Remember his role as the Joker in 1989s "Bat- 



Nicholson'- character exudes that same vibe 
all over again, except with a little more heart and 
a little less makeup. I sec 'cult classic' written all 
over this one. 

The thing I appreciate the most about "The 
Departed'' is that it's an experience in the truest 
sense of the word. 

It is violent, gritty, intelligent and beautiful 
all at the same time It exists outside of so many 
boundaries ami it is not alraid to be taboo. 

While watching this movie, you will not 
know what will happen nest, and just like in real 
life, what happens may not be the most pleasant 

If you are a fan of gangster movies, police 
movies, or intelligent movies n: general, do your- 
self a favor and see '

Ann Arbor. MI - IPFW 
Women's Tennis was repre-

ais hosted by Michigan State. 

In the Round of 64, IPFW's 
Stacy Lish fell to Wisconsin's 
(1-4) seed Chelsea Nusslock, 
6-2, 7-6(6). 

In consolation, Lish fell to 
Bradley's Elise Montrose, 6-

In doubles action, the 
team of Lish and Coulson 
played Purdue's Anna Dzcve

Dzeve and Duru defeated 
Lish and Coulson, 8-4. 

In consolation, Lish and

The ladies fell to Purdue,

"Stacy played very well 
against Wisconsin, especially 
in the 2nd set, and had chanc-

Mastodons Win on Senior Day 












Fort Wayne. IN- The 
IPFW Mastodons' Soccer 
Team picked up their first- 
ever Mid-American Confer- 
ence win on Sunday, drop- 
ping Bowling Green 2-1 on 
Senior Day. 

It was a fitting beginning 
for the Mastadons, as senior 
forward Barry Morgan got 



IPFW on the board early in 
the match. Morgan tapped 
home a perfect cross from 
junior Evan Coss at the 2:43 

IPFW added to their 1-0 
lead in the second half. 

At the 76:17 mark, senior 
defender Ben Springman sent 
junior forward Chas Perry 
in on goal, and Parry had 
no trouble beating Falcon's 
keeper Paul Shoemaker to 
the left side. 



That was a huge goal for 
IPFW, for just five minutes 
later Bowling Green found 
the back of the net. 

Off of a scrum at the top 
of the box, sophomore de- 
fender Kyle Williams found 
the ball and drilled a hard 
shot past IPFW keeper Mi- 
chael Knitter. 

That was the only ball 
that got past the Mastodons' 
nctminder. Knitter made 
seven saves to nail down the 



win for IPFW. With the win. 
IPFW improves to 2-13-1, 
1-4-0 MAC. Bowling Green 
falls to 3-14-1. 0-4-0 MAC. 

It was the last regular sea- 
son match for IPFW in the 
MAC. 

The 'Dons will begin 
playing next season in the 
Mid-Continent Conference. 

IPFW finishes out the reg- 
ular season with a road match 
at Western Illinois next Sun- 
day at 1pm.

accomplishments together. 

In July, senior Mutt Fry 
was named a Cleveland Golf 
All-America Scholar. 

"This is an outstanding 
accomplishment for Mall," 
said Head Coach Jeff Marsh. 
"Over the course of the last 
three years, Matt has consis- 
tently maintained a high GPA 
as well as improving his golf 
game at the same time." 

In order to be named a 
Cleveland Golf All-Amcri- 
can Scholar, an athlete has to 
maintain at least a 3.2 GPA 
and maintain a sub-76 stroke 
average. Some might be able 
to do one or the other, but 
doing both should be com- 
mended. 

Also in July, sophomore 
Alison Rathsman was named a 
National Golf Coaches Asso- 
ciation All-American Scholar. 
This honor is similar to the 
men's award in that there are 
some very tough qualification 

An athlete has to maintain 
a 3.5 GPA and play in at least 
50% of the team's regularly- 
scheduled rounds throughout 
the season in order to qualify 
for the NGCA All-American 
Scholar award. 

Coach Marsh praised 
Ralhsman's work ethic on and 
off (he course. 

"She has a great work 
ethic in the classroom and the 
on the golf course and it has 
spilled over to the rest of the

combined GPA and the wom- 
en's team posted a 3.18. 

On the course, the teams 
have set records (team and
