Swanwliite ns its second pro- 
diictian of the reason, running 
Nov. 27-2Q. Dec. 4-6. Director 
William Turck has adapted 
Strindberg's sur-rcalislic blend 
of ihc fairest and uglical of Swe- 
dish folk-lore to provide a 
theatrical experience exciting 
to every age group. 

Music and Lighting effects 
recreate the "nlagic" required 
in the script, as well as the 
unique elements impossible to 
reproduce naturalistically. As 
an example, the "peacock" 
^ins an illusionaiy fonn by the 
use of inlermillcnl blue li^ts 
behind a sheer curtain. Medie- 
val Church music contributes to 
an Ethereal atmosphere. 

Technical director, Dr. 
Franklin 0. fCenworthy has c(»i- 
slnicled an outstanding! set 
-- which allows for unlimited 
opportunilies in creative stage 
movement. Never before hag 
P.l.T.'s stage achieved a height 
of 7 2 (part of the ceiling was 
removed), nor included bo many 
leveb, mmps, and stairs. 

Linda Lubkcn's coetiime 
design is based on a brilliant 
color scheme of soft, draping 
knits. Spectacular is the black- 
velvet, floor-Iengthi gown worn 
by the wicked step-mother (Carol 
Fishering). Tlie skirt is a fulU 
circle. Bad the pointed sleeves,

A TTENTION STUDENTS 
We are introducing a Utile something new into the COMMUN- 
ICATOR to make each Friday a little nicer. This is the editorial 
page and we are its new editors. Our names are Dan and Rick. 
We tell you this not because we are egolislical but because we 
like to be nice, friendly folk. Recently this page has been craih- 
med with rather, boring incedeniah. He uouU Uh to bring an end 
to this. So we decided this will be your page (nice, huh?). We 
would appreciate your writing in to us. You may iirite about tiny- 
thing. (Examples -tell as How wrecked you got last weekend, tell 
us about a bully teacher, tell us about a cap who kit you on the 
head, tell us about anything that really pipes you.) Vou can do 
tlial can't you? Naturally there are a few catches. We will have 
to do some censoring, we also will have to slip in an editorial of 
our own occasionally. But this will not be an "Ann Landers" 
(jpc, no sirree! To gel you slarted'we haw written an editorial-', 
look around you'll find it. Hopefully this '■page will air a lot of 
little things that add up to bigger things. B'e are open to both pos- 
itive and negative comments but lend.to be more happy with the 
positive. By the ivay, if things aren't loo together this week, it's 
because we've just started. Please have patience. Thank you.

Syb would have argued, but 
already the girl had studied 
her intently enougA to be able 
to identify her in any lineup so 
she look the football and made 
a frantic, exil. 

She net her accomplices, 
Sue Hemrick and Karen FraccK-

football in the back of the yel- 
low Malibu. The three of them 
fled to a hockey game. 

Bui it was all for nothing. 
The picnic was called off. They 
could take the football and run, 
but they would have to do it 
without the rest of Dr. Gott-

Dear Editor: 

The Biology Club needed 
a football for its picnic. No- 
thing else wouM :do; they had 
to have a football. 

It jvas hie Friday after- 
noon and the plan was about to 
go inlo effect. . . Dave Schlo- 
scher had cased the place, and 
came stalking into the cafeteria 
to give Syb'Mrattain the details. 
They had suspected him. He re- 
ported: somehow they had known 
that he was not a mernher of the 
Biology Club. She would have 
to go it alone. 

At exactly 4:51, she lap-l^ 
proached the door marked "Stu- 
dent Services," assuming an 
expression of innocence. She 
entered and nervously reque- 
sUd a football for the Biology 
Club picni

A Real Bomber 

by the Editorial Editors 

Recently our quaint, quiet University in calm collected Fort 
Wayne was ivictimized by a prank bomb scare. Most of us thought 
this was hilarious and openly praised this anonymous caller for 
his charming sense of humor and for bringing about a shtrt libera- 
tion. However, this incident hardly gave us a good look at the 
real bomber. The real bomber does not find his work_comical as 
was witnessed at the University of Wisconsin as (|,OOD,DOO dol- 
lars worth of computers went up. 

The real bomber is not merely hoping to frighten our Society 
but to destroy it, destroying it so that a society founded on human 
values instead of commefcral values can be established. He re- 
gards his act as a direct attack on the exploitation and rascism 
that abounds in our capitalistic society. 

To becofw a bomber doesn't require a vast artwunt of skill 
and knowledge. One demolition' expert put it this .way, "I could 
teach a troop of Cub Scouts to blow up a building in no time." 
Obtaining explosives doesn't present a ;voblem either. In many 
states dynamite can be bought with no questions asked |. If there 
are financial problems, almost any construction site stockpiles 
dynamite, so stealing it beaomes as easy as potpping open a pad- 
lock. Hany G I's disgusted by what they have been through join 
the revolutionary forces and put their knowledge to work. 

The bomber is not a blood-crazy fanatic who likes to see de- 
capacitated human bodies. His targets are not people but buildings 
which arc used to continue the war effort or connected wiht capi- 
talistic exploitation. Their targets range from ROTC buildings to 
established institutions and businesses. Later some bombers 
admit it may become necessary to eliminate cerOin heads of ma- 
jor vras industries as they are "real criminals." But they state 
this cannot come about until the public realizes they are "crimin- 
als." 

There seems to be little doubt in the minds of these terror- 
ists as to how best to bring about a new society, so I guess it is 
up to us to show these misguMed souls as to where they are 
wrong. 



Election Date 
Hurts S. Gl. 

by Scott Gillie 

Student government has not 
reached its potential in terms 
of being an ejleciive organiza- 
tion to represent student inter- 
ests. During, the past seven 
months of the present adminis- 
tration, an effort has been 
undertaken to remove from 
student goverrunent the label 
with effectiveness which deser- 
ves the title of government. The 
process of building an effective 
orgartizalion does not begin and 
end with each successive gen- 
eration of student government 
personnel. The potential of 
student government will never 
be realized unless the efforts 
of the preceding student govern- 
ment administration can be 
cumulatively transferred to the: 



Continunity in the transfer 
from one student government 
administration to the next is 
nearly impossible with the 
present system of electing a 
student government in April or 
May. Final exams, an impending 
summer vacation, and n 
other aspects, of confus 
associated with the end of a 



all i 






the necessary continuity froi 
one regime to the nexL 

Serious consideration 

should be given to the poss- 
ibility of scheduling student 
government elections early in 



thes 



condsi 



If elections were held, for 
instance, during the middle of 
February, the efforts of the 
present student government ad- 
ministration could be passed on 
to the successors. The needless 
duplication of bureaucratic 
organization could certainly be 
limited. The primary respon- 
sibility of student government 
—that of allocating activity 
monies— would be handled by 
one administration instead of 
the confusion of transferring 
the task to the incoming dis- 
oriented and inexperienced 
administralion. 

If student government is to 
continue the building process 
toward reaching its potential 
ihc necessity of continuity must 
be realized and effectively 
dealt with immediately.

by Oarrcll Bam in 

Haiae a ruckus!! [ndiara- 

Purduc's Tuskers opened bas- 
ketball play at Grace College 
Tuesday night with n "give em

nearly Bucceeded in cmcifying 
the Lanccis before a record 
crowd of 3,086. '&gt;'" w="^ dumped 
in Ihc final aecondB 68-66- 

Both teamg in the first 
half-well I won't say they were 
doad.-let it suffice that they 
made the transitions peacefully. 
Grace built an early lead of 
12~4and prayed iheir way to a 
34—18 command. 

Watching Grace play bas- 
ketball, is like watching drunks 
direct traffic, lie one excep- 
tion was John Christncr'a un- 
canny and sobering ability to 
hit. 

But the Tuaking Mastodons 
played the firat half as if they 
were extinct. Five pale ivhite 
coqoes moved on the floor— 
looking for directions to the 
nearest mortuary. It was like 
watching runaway cadavers. 

A seasoned reporter notices 
things-like a tendency to over- 
come rigor-^ottis and a coach

Although this year's record 
was not very encouraging, thin^ 
look bright for next year. Tliis 
year's record was two wins and 
eleven losses. All players 
listed on the squad will proba- 
bly be turning next year. Ha- 
ving the team should be a lot 
stronger with this added expcr- 



The Mastodons then found firing 
power from Johnlo^ and Glass 
and moved in ,48-4-1 with 1:S3 
left. 

Al 48-44 Indiana-Rjrdue's 
black magic caused the Lflnccr's 
coach to send his aides scurry- 
ing for holy water. 

Johnloz Craft, and Coonan 
were questioned by the refs as 
the Tuskers inched in 54-52- 
Hie players protested back that 
they had nothing to do with the 
"wilhcring" of the Lancer's 

It was at this time ibat^a 
peculiear fellow dressed in Igth 
ceotuiy attire was spotted speak- 
ing to Grace's coach. Some 
claim it was Done other than 
Daniel Webster. 

Daniel pointed at Grace's

were told after the game that

teen?iCl2 and a Biblical figure 
were purely coincidental. Ne-

tiply baskets as if they were 
2 loaves and a tish. 

The hectic final minutes 
found Christner matching the 
'I\iskers bucket for bucket, to 
the ever mounting frustration 
of Indiana— Purdue. 

Christner's personal ava-

STACKS should be Included, and timetables should be required 
for phosing out old slacks that don't meet slondords. 

2) In Item 1 again, I oppose the "grandfather" exemptions, 
support clarification the Board proposes on stock height as related 
to surrounding structures, but obiect to qualifying the rule as sub- 
ject to other governmental regulations unless this is more cleorly 
defirwd in the regulation. I feel thot "olher" regulations could 
include local regulotions thai could be politically manipulated by 
oir polluters to fence out the restriction APC--13 would otherwise 
impose. I )also question in this Item how future i nter pre! o lions 
will determine what levels of sulphur dioxide will be injurious to 
plonis, onimols, humans, ond property. The phrose". . .or which 
reasonably imoy adversely affect. . ." should be added. 

3) Item 2 oppeors to represent a serious control principle, but 
I wish to state thot stack height con not be accepted as an olter- 
natlve to removing sulphur dioxide from the stock effluent before 
discharge. I do nol feel Item 3 is effective enough, and should 
have additional factors. Total sulphur dioxide emissions greater 
from ALL sources should not exceed 500 lbs. /hour in orty ]2- 
squoro mile oreo. Anyemissions' fl'^o'" thon this could couso 
rapid and dangerous buildups urwler atmospheric conditions which 
occur in this region. 

4) Under Item 3, the proposed amendment would permit aver- 
aging of fuels, designed to borely meet standards. This is not a 
sound policy; a total offorl should be made instead toward prs- 
treotmenl of high sulphur fuels which will reduce this content be- 

5) The Board' is commended for proposing to make needed 
oddilional controls mandatory insteod of permissive. HOWEVER, 
I totally oppose the Board's reserving discretionary authority to 
grant vorioices from the regulation. This would be subject to 
great polllicol pressure, would be discriminatory, ond would under- 
mine the &lt;A^ole principle of control.

acclaim second only to the 
Beatles. (Are you impressed?) 
But the Band aren't supetstara.

I was slighlly disappointed. The

really nothing wrong with that, 
. except 1 dozed off twice, TTiere 
isn't a whole lot wrong with 
that except it coel me three-and 
a hair bucks. [ con sleep for 
free at home. But all in all it 
was a pleasant experience not 
pleasant enou^ to repeat. Tlie 
difference between The Band 
live and The Band on record is 
one of volume, ffith a good 
stereo and a Band album you 
can capture Tie Band live. It 
is very good relnxin' music. 

Next week: The Mothers of 
Invention live in Chicago.
