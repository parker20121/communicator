Last week, tlie 
Anthropology Club 

showed "Influenza 

1918," a film by PBS ihai 
discussed "the worst 
epidemic the United 
Slates has ever known." 
Showing the movie 
was socially relevant to 
today's HlNl scare. 

The flu pandemic of 
1918 was also a scary 
situation for many 
There was no way to get 
away from the sickness. 
People "cannot get away 
from respiratory diseases 
because we all have to 
breathe," one doctor said 
on the PBS video. 

Vaccines did not help 
with the ilu pandemic 
of 1918; even bodies of 
the dead were seemingly 
contagious. In the movie, 
the flu struck its victims 
quickly. 

Tliey often awoke fine 
in the morning and were 
deadbyevening.Supplies 
of caskets ran out during 
this time due to high 
demand. The film also 
speculates an interesting 
eiiWronmenlal hazard 
that may have caused 
some of the illness 
to spread and naveL 
At Fort Riley, soldiers 
burned manure and nvo 
da&gt;-s later, the first flu 



victims turned up in the 
wards, violently ill. The 
soldiers were presented 
to the infirmaries 
with pneumonia-like 
symptoms. 

"Attack the germs 
before they attack you,' 
became one of the 
mottos during the flu 
season of 1918. People 
were quarantined if they 
were even suspected of 
being Ul. 

But with today's swine 
flu, the outlook does not 
appear to be that grim. 

"While the vast 
majority of people who 
have contracted swine 
flu have recovered 
ivithout needing 

medical treatment, 

hospitalizations and 
deaths have occurred," 
said Flu.gov, the U.S. 
government's influenza 
site. 

People who are 
getting the HlNl 
virus are also mostly 
immunocompromised 
or in high risk groups. 

"About 70 percent of 
people who have been 
hospitalized with HlNl 
have had one or more 
medical conditions thai 
placed them in the high 
risk catego^'." said Flu. 
gov. 

The high risk category- 
includes those with 
heart disease, asthma. 



diabetes, kidney diseases 
and those who are 
pregnant. 

The student on 
campus who was 
diagnosed with HlNl 
this week is under the 
care of a doctor and 
has not returned to the 
university since the 
diagnosis, which will 
further reduce the spread 
of the illness. 

Just like any other 
flu, it is important 
to use alcohol based 
antibacterial sanitizers 
and wash your hands 
whenever you have 
touched an object or 
a surface that anyone 
else may have touched. 
Additionally, if you feel ill. 
it is best to stay home and 
stay away from others. It 
may also be worth it to 
take extra vigilance in the 
campus computer labs, 
by cleaning the keyboard 
and mouse with sanitizer 
before using it. 

If you do get sick, 
a vaccination wifl be 
available soon. 

Four MINI vaccines 
have been approved 
by the FDA and are 
expected to be out next 
month. Lastly, there is 
no need to shun pufled 
pork sandiviches. While 
it is nicknamed swine flu, 
eating pork pnaducts will 
not make people sick.

Benefits of Controvesy 

A healthy democracy is only efficient 
when it has two different view points 



Lobbying takes unexpected 
role in student government 




STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT 

By Amanda McCann 

siiipKsOip(w.edu 

There are two kinds of controversy, 
one of which should be embraced and 
the otiier of which should be spat upon 
and cast out. TV\'o people looking at 
the same issue in different ways and 
comhig to different conclusions? That 
is a beautitul thing, as long as each 
is able to explain himself and truly 
consider tlie other side. Objectively 
considering that your own position is 
wrong, or at least that the other person 
may have a solid point, is the key factor. 
Obviously an argument involving 
yelling or sobbing is rarely productive, 
but just because two people are smiling 
and keeping their voices level doesn't 
mean they are having a productive 
discussion. Open-mindedness is 
required. 

There is. however, something worse 
than bad controversy. And that is dead 
silence. As annoying as it is. better one 
lone sobbing individual presenting 
a different vievifpoiiit than a roomful 
of sheep who ne^-er ask questions. 



Obviously the ideal is to have everyone 
involved in thoughtful debate, but if 
given a choice, better Socrates as a 
thorn in everyone's side then the world 
of Geoi^e Orwell's 1984. If the majority 
never raise objections, those in power 
will take the advantage and push 
their own agenda. Many facing what 
appears to be group consensus, remain 
silent unless they feel their objection 
is absolutely airtight. How often are 
objections absolutely airtight? Never 
A counter can be raised to every 
objection, and a counter to every 
counter. But through this dialogue, 
the stronger ideas can rise to the top. 
Natural selection of ideas takes place 
in every good debate, as it must if there 
is to be superior end result Good ideas 
rarely, if ever, pop into existence fully 
formed. Ideas have to be interrogated, 
tested, and tweaked or abandoned. 
Those in a position to make decisions 
have an obligation to ensure that this 
process happens, even if it means 
slowing down progress for a minute to 
ask a question or examine a loophole. 

I'm sorely tempted to start talking 
about thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. 
but that would be unfair for everyone 
who has yet to take Philosophy 101. 
Thus, I'll boil it down to this: yay 
democracy. A healthy democracy is 
not as efficient as a demagogue- driven 
horde of bobble-headed zombies. 
It is, however, less likely to fall into 
corruption. Different ideologies have 
different strengths and weaknesses, 
and giving them an opportunity to 
compete per issue increases the odds 
of benefiting from the one and avoiding 
the other. If you feel uncomfortable 
about the direction everyone else is 
going, speak up. There are probably 
others who feel the same ivay and 
are just keeping quiet. In the modem 
dialogue on diversity, perhaps the 
most significant aspect of what makes 
individuals beautifully different from 
each other is often overlooked and 
rarely celebrated: different ideas.

STUDENT ISSU"' 

FIRST AMENDMENT FREE FOODFESIVAL 

Students participate in Free Food Festival, sign away rights 



By Katy Anderson 

The IPFWAlumni- 
Plazawas turned into 
the People's Republic 
of (he Socialist Slates of 
Ihe Kingdom of Masta- 
donja for an hour and a 
half on Sept. 17, Consti- 
tution Day. This festival 
was a simulation of what 
life would be like without 
rhe First Amendment. 

Constitution Day is a 
day of American obser- 
vance to commemorate 
the signing of the U.S 
Constitution. Accord- 
ing to the law that estab- 
lishes this holiday, any 
school receiving federal 
funds must observe this 
day. 

Normally, one might 
expect this day to entail 
an educational lecture, 
panel or movie about the 
events leading to and the 
consequences after the 
Constitution was signed. 

While these activi- 
ties provide insight of 
the significance of the 
Constitution, the festival 
allowed students to take 
part in a hands-on and 
comical experience to 
illustrate the Constitu- 
tion's importance.

simulations have taken 
place across the coun- 
try. Art Students League 
and event coordinator 
Said El-Dajani partici- 
pated in a simulation at 
a conference last year. El- 
Dajani thought it was an

interesting social experi- 
ment that he believed 
the campus was ready 
for because the student 
population at IPFW has 
become younger in re- 
cent years, and younger 
students are perhaps 
more inclined to give up 
their rights for free food. 

Various IPFW student 
groups participated in 
this event. 

"It was very impor- 
tant that I didn't do it by 
myself." El-Dajani said, 



"I wanted to get as many 
people involved and I 
really wanted it to be a 
community event." 

The IPFW Dagorhir 
Club, a group in which 
members participate 
in combat-driven role 
playing, posed as the 
oppressive police offi- 
cers of Mastadonia. The 
treatment a student re- 
ceived was determined 
by theirpasspori and 
a ticket that was arbi- 
trarily given to them at 



the entrance. 

The Art Students 
League also helped with 
the event, including 

of the Berlin 
Wall. Students were able 
to spray paint whatever 
they wanted onto a white 
wall. Students from an 
Illustration II class also 
helped create chalk 
murals to advertise the 

The IPFW Student 
Government also helped 



by providing funding for 
the event, and Student 
Government coordinator 
Hagi Bradley acted as the 
king of Mastadonia. 

Other groups, includ- 
ing the Global Christian- 
Fellowship and the IPFW 
Communicator, had 

stands outsidethe event 
and served as ambassa- 
dors. 

Some students re- 
ceived normal treatment 
and had no problems get- 
ting the free Casa's meal. 



Others were surprised 
when a police officer 
yelled at them and re- 
fused to let them get In 
line for the free food, but 
were instead din;ctcd to 
other Mastadoniun offi- 
cials and were given vari- 
ous obstacles to com- 
plete. 

IPFW student Khao 
Ngo was one of the vic- 
tims who had to endure 
a tedious bureaucratic 
process to receive Ihe 
(rcc lunch, including an 
instance in which he had 
In light a Dagorhir police 
Dfhcer for gold coins. "I 
am having fun, but I'm 
hungry," Ngo said when 
■.landing in the long line 
tor food for a second 
time.'They put me in 
jail." After talking to the 
press, Ngo was immedi- 
ately yelled at, again, by 
a Dagorhir police officer. 

Although treatment 
among students was not 
equal, in many cases op- 
pressive, most students 
appeared to be enjoying 
themselves and under- 
stood the general con- 
cept of the event. 

El-Dajani believed 
the event was a success, 
among those reasons the 
broad pariicipalion and 
coming over a thousand 
dollars under-budget. 
He also believes the fes- 
tival has the potential to 
become an annual event 
because any student or- 
ganization can take a 
hold of the concept and 
make it their own. 





Bernadette Gleeson 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

schnp|D)9fl(idi nts.lplw.(du 



Art is a subjective 
word. It can iiave any 
number of meanings 
to different people. It 
can describe a sinL 
painting or sculpture. 
Even an entire gallery of 
different pieces can be 
considered a work of an. 
Then, of course, there 
are the performing arts 
such as theatre, dance 
and music. 

Literature is 

another art form, that 
doesn't always get the 
recognition it desires. 
In most cases, an can't 
get pigeon holed into 
a single medium but is 
spread across muldple 
media; such is the 
case with poetry of 
Bernadette Gleeson. 

Gleeson isn't your 
typical artist; she 
doesn't dedicate her life 
to perfecting the craft 
of poetry in a formal 
classroom setting. For 
Gleeson, the art ofwri ting 
and subsequently 

performing poetry is an 
act of self disclosure. 
Her words- both written 
and spoken are a portal 
into her soul, an expose 
of who she is at that 
moment in time. 

Gleeson grew up 
in the hip-hop culture 
outside of Chicago, 
which is where her love of 
poetry first took root. "I 
made up rhymes for my 
basketball team about 
the other team dissing 
them and tearing them 
apari" said Gleeson. 

She staned 

performing in 1999 first 
in Chicago, then Fon 
Wayne she really go into 
it when she was studying 
abroad in London. She 
went on to run her own 
open mic in Chicago 
from 2002-2004. 

Although 
Gleeson has never 
submitted any of her 
work to be published, she 
did put out a cd back in 
2001 called "Flowery". 

"It really is just an 
outlet for me. a way for 
me to share my feelings 
and emotions," Gleeson 
said that all she wants to 
do is connect to people 
with her poetrj', and let 
them know that thev 
aren't in this world atone. 
Her favorite 

poem she's ever written 
is called "Obsession", in it 
she tells her audience the 
funny quirks that make 
up who she is. with the 
idea that "You control

By Louisa Danielson 

danilj01O&gt;ptw.tdu 



It was a lovely eve- 
ning for having a concert 
- clear air. no clouds, a 
minimal breeze and fresh 
grass. However, it was 
also a bit chilly. So the 
Philharmonic decided to 
move their concert into 
the Auer Auditorium in 
IPFW's Rhineheart Music 
Center. This was prob- 
ably a good move, as the 
auditorium had better 
acoustics - and didn't 
have mosquitoes. 

The concert be- 
gan with El gar's Pomp 
and Circumstance and 
Brahm's Academic Festi- 
val Overture. The latter 
piece was full of pulsing 
cellos, echoing French 
horns and clashing cym- 
bals. Due to the excellent 
acoustics of the audito- 
rium, every note was easy 



to hear - even the soft 
tremolo of the strings. 

A haunting flute 
duel trickled into the au- 
ditorium at the start of 
Smetana's T7ic Moldau. 
This tone poem ivas writ- 
ten to depict the path of 
the Moldau River, and the 
flutes did a perfect imi- 
tation of small streams, 
twining their minor mel- 
odies into an expanding 
brook of sound. The rest 
of the orchestra joined 
like tributaries, small piz- 
zicatos from the violins 
dropping in, followed by 
broader cello tones. At 
the close of the work, flic 
orchestra was engulfed in 
a tremendous foriisslmo, 
as though the waters had 
finally arrived at flieir 
delta. A small child chat- 
tered happily at the end 
of the piece, just before 
the applause.

Her chosen an form go down in life. possibly Communication 

isn't simply letters on Gleeson received or Public Policy. 



The album com- 
mences with "Skate or 
Die," a fast song with a 
poppy opening vrfu'ch 
makes for a great intro- 
duction. The next few 
songs follow and yes, it 
is fiill of the upbeat fun 
that one could look for 
in a good-naiured punk 
album. As the Lntroduc- 
tioos and first few cracks 
are a blast, this album 
takes a very interesting 
tum- 

What is fascinating 
about this album b that 



after the fun of the first 
few songs is over, it takes 
a darker turn with iht 
song "Forbidden Planet" 
and once the darker turn 
is taken, die album stays 
as such for a solid few 
tracks. It follows a very 
logical progression that 
is fairly rare in a lot of al- 
bums put out today This 
is not saying dial musi- 
cians today do not know 
hoiv to put out a record, 
that is not the case at all, 
however this album does 
a far better job at showing 
that there was flioughr 
put into the order of the 
track listing. 

In the song "Tongue- 
hrter," it becomes overtly 
obvious that the Titey 
Oime From The Sfuidows 
does not offer a confusing 
taste of tunes. The aura 
of (he music itself is noi 
consiandy changing and 
transitioning from one ' 
feel to the next is done 
very weli. and the follow- 
ing tracks solidify this 
statement. Each track 
from beginning to end is 
filled with something new 
and it is consistendy good 
from start to finish. 

Though it is good, 
it is noi great Shadows 
is an album that has re- 
play value simply for the 
fact that the emotional 
connotations made in the 
flow together very nicely 
It is pleasurable in the 
fact that, like mentioned 
before, it does not jump 
around and the themes 
stay consistent through-

"Beggar" Release: 
Not Up to Par 



By Robin Crowell 

lob invourgriiveOgniiill ,com 



Artist Thrice 
Album: Beggars 
Label: Vagrant 
Release Date: 
September 15, 2009 

Sounds Like: An 
over-dramatized 
attempt to sound like 
Muse and Nirvana- 
Rating: 1/5 




First and foiemost. 
the opening track of an 
album should not be an 
attempt to sound like 
somebody else, plain 
and simple. The first 
song on the album. 
-M The Worid Is Mad." 
offers little more than a 
poor impersonation of 
Muse, It is backed with 
ivhat are presumably 
meant to sound 
like intimidating or 
demented guitars. 



which work for a brief 
second or two. then the 
vocals start in and the 
utter lack of conviction 
in the words he is saying 
is enough to make the 
listener want to eject 
this album even this 
early on in the playback. 
By the second song, 
it is ob\ious how forced 
and unnecessarily 

distoned the music is. 
It is not good, it is just 
distracting. Disiracdng 
from what remains to 
be seen, but it makes 
the instruments blend 
togeUier like a cluster 
that doesn't make 
sense, a traffic accident 
if you will. 

Through several 
failed attempts at 
mimicking the soimds 
of Muse, it seems as 
though Thrice just gives 
up and then attempts to 
sound like Kurt Cobain, 
which not surprisingly, 
doesn't work either. It 
took all I could to make 
it to the end of this 
album. 

Some of the 
interludes are cool and 
almost trance like, but 
then the vocals come 
back into the picture, 
meaningless distortion 
plagues the sound 
waves, and the nuisance 
continues. 




1 was almost too embarrassed to actually review 
this CD in thinking my roommate's would make fitn 
of me for actually even playing the tracks. Most of 
us remember him from his 2002 track "Drift Away" 
from M&gt; Stranger to Shame which was an over- 
played cover song by Dobie Gray on the radio and 
made il to the point thai it sounded like nails on a 
chalk board. After the Beat Boys freed Matthew Sha- 
fer's (Uncle Kracker) soul, he began to feature on 
Kenny Chesney's songs, especially "When the Sun 
Goes Down" up imtil the debut of his album Happy 
Houron Tuesday 

I am imclear on how others feel about a singer- 
songwriter being in the rock, hip hop, country, and 
rap rock category, but it does not bode well with 
me. 1 am alright with listening to different ranges 
of music, although I feel like when artists attempt 
this they end up losing some of their fans. Also, 
not only is he a singer-songwriter, but he's also a 
DJ — for whom was he a Dl. you ask? He did this for 
none other than Kid Rock (Robert fames Ritchie), in 
TVvisted Brown TVucker. 

As of September 18th, the album was rated for 
four out of five stars, with avid Uncle Kracker fans 



backing up all of the bad reviews. One Amazon user 
stated that the album was "definitely the best al- 
bum Uncle Kracker has released to date" and even 
compared it to the laid back style of mtislc from the 
United Kingdom (wait, what?). 

Overall the album sounds like it was produced 
very nicely and is great quality. There are definite- 
ly some catchy— yet ridiculous— lyrics; however 
this CD is not my type of listening material. Uncle 
Kracker really finds his childhood creativity com- 
ing into use when he writes his lyrics: "every train 
wreck's got me buzzin'/like I'm drunk on Robitus- 
sin" and also trying to rhyme "movies" with "boo- 
bies." In "My Girlfriend" he talks about his girlfriend 
having a girlfriend now. so apparently he wants to 
be friends with Katy Perry. 

It can definitely be said that there are different 
sounds throughout the album — rock, pop, coun- 
try — but it doesn't sound too horrible. The album is 
already #39 on the charts and is expected to climb 
even further, which scares me. R's catchy, but lacks 
substance.

Death 



By Devin and Hana 



GIRL 

Death; a word almost considered 
taboo in American society, especially 
amongst college-age people. We do 
not like to talk about death and when 
it comes to dealing \yith tit, we do not 
ioiow the "right" way to act. 

TVuly, there is no right way to deal 
with the death of a loved one. Death is 
not only scary lo us, but it is the loss of 
someone that was a pan of our lives. 
When someone close to your age dies, 
especially, it is very hard because you 
think "wow... that could be me," 

There are. however, seven basic 
stages of grief: shock/denial, pain/ 
guilt, anger/ bargaining, depression/ 
loneliness, the upward turn, recon- 
struction and acceptance /hope. These 
are pretty self-explanatory and basic, 
but not everyone goes through these 
steps the same way or in the same or- 
der, so do not feel like there is a certain 
way you need to be dealing with death. 
1 do, however, suggest that you DO 
take some time off from your normal 
routine to sift through your emotions, 
but do NOT cut yourself off from your 
life for too long. After a week or so, you 
should start getting yourself back into 
a routine, to make the process of get- 
ting used to the loss easier. No matter 
where the person is or what happened 
to diem, they would not want ^-ou to 
suffer a life of sonrnv because they had 
to leave it. 



BOY 

Death is never an easy thing to 
deal with but is something that should 
be addressed. Keeping it bottled up will 
only cause more pain and keep you 
from movingon and living a heal thy life. 
If it were me, I would take some time 
off to be by myself before I reach out 
to others. Sometimes you need time to 
really take in the situation and analyze 
yourself before you move on. You need 
to know how it is affecting you and be 
aware of it. If you do not know exactly 
what you are dealing with, you will not 
be ready for the challenges ahead. 

That challenge is Living life. Life as 
you know it is different now. You have to 
pick up what you got and keep pressing 
forward. You cannot turn back time, so 
you eventually have to accept it. After 
you have yourself figured out, if need 
be, talk to others. Do not try to ignore 
the problem, but if someone brings it 
upandyoudonotwantto talkaboutit, 
that is your right and they need to re- 
spect that. Your grief is your grief, and 
theyhavenoright tobeapart of it un- 
less you give them access lo it. 

That being said, if you are confused, 
getting other opinions on it and seeing 
things through new angles is healthy. 
The one thing you have to know at the 
end of the day. is that it is not over. Your 
world may have taken a pretty strong 
blow, but the world has not ended yet. 
Those loved ones who have passed 
away would want to see you embrac- 
ing life. Thai does not mean not to be 
sad. that just means appreciate what 
you still have on your plate, ^'ou are still 
here, it is not over, so keep going.

IPFW Lady 'Dons end week 2-1 



By Monica Gerdeman 



A seE from Shannon Reuter to outside hitler 
Stephanie Lambert i was just how the match went laM 
Tuesday Sept. 1 5 against Western Michigan. Lamberti 
was on the lop of her A' game with a match and ca- 
reer-high of 1 1 kills on the late night action. 

As the first set seemed lo drag on for hours, the 
lead was finally claimed by the Mastodons on point 
13 and IPFW never looked back. (25-191 

Going into game two, the 'Dons look control from 
the gel go playing an up-beat, fast pace game finish- 
ing 25- 19. 

Games three and four where not on the Mast- 
odon's agenda, as a slow start really gave Western 
Michigan the upper edge. Once IPFW reached 13 in 
game three, nothing seemed to go their way and llu' 
final score was 13-25. 

Game four seemed to go a little better, but the 
'Dons still couldn't pull a win finalizing the game at 
19-25. 

The fifth and final game on the night was a finger- 
nail-bitter for the entire gymnasium. Because the 
fifth game is only played until 15 it, it was a back and 
forth rally until IPFW sealed the deal at 15-12. 

Senior setter, Reuter completed her night Mth 3 1 
assists. The kill's column was led by Lamberti with 1 1 
and closely followed by Rebekah Roehm with lO.Digs 
were led by senior lamic Schwartz. 

Moving on to Friday night action, the Mastodons 
hosted a hard wood matchup against the North Da- 
kota State Bison. Wth a home crowd, Gates Sports 
Center was rolling with excitement. The Lady Dons 
fed off the noise for the first two games on the night 
but couldn't hold on to the last three. 

Both Lamberti and Roehm tallied 15 kills apiece, 
as Lamberti once again had a game high. Reuter 
picked up her second straight season-high in assists 
with 37, as also pulling a game high was Schwartz 
with 28 digs. 

The match ended at two games to three and the

The IPFW women's 
soccer team headed east 
Sunday for a late after- 
noon match up in Ath- 
ens, Ohio, to battle Ohio 
University. In search of 
their first victory of the 
season, there stood the 
very tough and talented 
Ohio women's soccer 
team. 

The first half was qui- 
et on both sides of the 
field for both teams, and 
the game would quickly 
shift into the second half 
\vith no score, and good 
goaltending. In the 60* 
minute of the match, 
the game would quicldy 
heat up, when Jasmine 
Merith scored twice in 40 
seconds for Ohio, giving 
them a 2-0 lead. 

That of course 
wouldn't keep the Lady 
'Dotis down for long and 
the batded right back. 



lust seven minutes later, 
Justine Le Blanc headed 
in a tough 12 footer, and 
bring IPFW within one 
goal. 

With time running 
short, and the 'Dons be- 
ing well aware of the 
opportunity, Lisa Un- 
derwood would draw a 
penalty on the Ohio Uni- 
versity player. This gave 
Underwood an opportu- 
nity for a very big penalty 
kick that could tie the 
game. She connected on 
the penally kick, and the 
'Dons ded it up with jusi 
17 minutes left in regula- 
tion. 

Defeat had felt all too 
familiar for IPFW this 
season, and the Lady 
'Dons pushed and played 
hard like always, trying 
10 get that big first win. 

In the 86"^ minute 
though, with only three 
remaining, Erin Schwen- 
ke of Ohio University, 
would tap one in o^ a 
rebound to give OU a 3-2 
lead. Unfortunately for 



IPFW. that's the way the 
game would end. The 
loss dropped ihc IPFW 
women's soccer team 
to 0-5-1, and gave Ohio 
University a 2-4 record. 

The Lady 'Dons have 
a few days of rest, then 
head to Illinois, to batde 
SlU-Edwardsville Sun- 
day, September 27, 2009 
in another afternoon 
match. After that, IPFW 
comes home for two 
straight home games on 
October 2nd and Oc- 
tober 4'". for two very 
big Summit Confer- 
ence match ups, playing 
Southern Utah Friday 
night at 7p.m. then the 
University of Missouri 
Kansas City also at 7p.m. 
at Heftier Field. 

The Lady 'Dons need 
some student suppon 
to help get some wins 
on the board, so head 
out the Heftier Field this 
weekend and cheer the 
Lady 'Dons onto a couple 
of big conference victo- 
ries.

Billion-dollar TV deals put SEC football in national spotlight 



ByPhilKegler 

IMMRE 



College fooiball is 
finally back, and the 
Southeastern Confer- 
ence hopes to keep its 
reputation as the nation's 
best league. 

With two historic 
television deals signed 
in the offseason, the t2 
teams will have plenty 
of chances to make their 
case from coast to coast. 

The SEC signed 15- 



year contracts with ESPN 
and CBS - worth S2.25 
billion and S825 million, 
respectively- during the 
ofl'season to showcase its 
athletes nationvride. 

The CBS deal extends 
its current status as the 
national broadcast net- 
work and will show one 
SEC game per week at 
3:30 p.m. on Saturdays. 

But now one 12:30 
p.m. game per week will 
be shown on ESPN Re- 
gional Television, which 
is syndicated to more 
than 66 million house- 
holds in 75 different 
markets. 



The so-called SEC 
Network will be ESPN's 
third-largest "channel" 
from noon to 3:30 p.m. 
on Saturdays, according 
to a ESPN press release, 
available in more homes 
than ESPNEWS or ES- 
PNU during that block. 
There also will be a new 
SEC-focused pregame 
show at noon with Rob 
Stone and Matt Stinch- 
comb. This SEC Network 
will debut with Western 
Kentucky-Tennessee on 
Saturday. 

OFthe league's 12sea- 
son openers, only one 
will be carried only on 



in-state pay-per-view 
(Missouri State- Arkan- 
sas!. Nine will be car- 
ried on ABC or an ESPN 
network, including the 
first game of the season 
Thursday night (South 
Carolina-N.C. State). 

"Opening games are 
really different," Auburn 
coach Gene Chizik said. 
"It's almost overkill be- 
cause you've got so much 
film you've watched 
over the summer and 
in the preseason. You've 
watched about every 
game you can watch, 
which sometimes is a 
little bit too much." 



Only four SEC 
schools (South Carolina. 
Georgia. Alabama, LSU) 
are facing an opponent 
from a BCS conference 
in the first week, but 
two of those feature pre- 
mier matchups between 
ranked teams - No. 13 
Georgia plays at No. 9 
Oklahoma Stale on Sat- 
urday at 3:30 p.m.. while 
No. 5 Alabama plays No. 
7 Virginia Tech in the 
Georgia Dome at 8 p.m. 

Alabama coach Nick 
Saban said national ex- 
posure was a big reason 
the Crimson Tide agreed 
to play the Hokies in the 



neutral-site Chick-fil- 
A College Kickoff. Lasi 
year, Alabama panic!' 
pated in the same event, 
using a 34-10 upset 
preseason No. 9 Clemson 
to make a statement en 
route to going undefeat- 
ed until the SEC Cham- 
pionship Game. 

"I certainly think thai 
last year our team prob- 
ably didn't know how 
good tliey could be," Sa- 
ban said. "The national 
exposure that we gel 
from playing in games 
like this enhances overall 
exposure and helps re- 
cruiting everywhere."

Men's soccer ties one, loses one 



By Logan Pea 

^3ll01(&gt;itud*rm.lpfw.Hu 



The IPFW Men's soc- 
cer learn headed inio the 
weekend with hope of 
going above .500 in the 
win column. Theysiart- 
ed their journey Friday 
evening at Hefner Stadi- 
um against the Red Flash 
from St. Francis. (PA) 

The 'Dons and Red 
Flash each netted one 
goal in the first half, with 
Daniel Moir of SFLf strik- 
ing first in the tenth min- 
ute. IPFW would answer 
right back in the 41" min- 
ute, when MaxTouloute 
would get control of an 
SFU turnover, and take it 
all the way lo 20 yards out 
where he would go top 
shelf on the SFU goalten- 
der to tie the game up at 
one heading into the sec- 
ond half. 

In half two, nothing 
happened, so we moved 
to overtime. In the extra 
frame, IPFWpul three big 
shots on the SFU goalten- 
der, but couldn't get one 
by, and in the 94"' min- 
ute, Kinglsey McLEOD 
of the Red Flash would 
knock one through from 




25 yards out to end the 
night for the 'Dons. 

The men's soccer 
team would get a day of 
rest and travel though, 
and would show up to 
Bowling Green, Ohio, 
ready to play a Sunday 
afternoon matinee. The 
only action in this game, 
though, would come 
in the first half. It was 
Chucko Evwaraye for 
BGSU, in the 13'^ min- 
ute, sneaking one by 
IPFW goaltender Dono- 
van Dowling, to give 



Bowling Green a 1-0 lead. 
As always, the 'Dons 
would answer back quick 
in the 22"'' minute, when 
Max Touloute would 
net his second goal of 
the weekend and tie the 
game at one. Defense 
would be the name of the 
game for the rest of the 
afternoon, and the game 
would end in a 1-1 tie, 
sending IPFW home for 
a big Summit Conference 
match up Friday night 
against Centenary Col- 
lege at 7 p.m.
