BARGER IMPEACHMENT 
FIASCO CONCLUDES 

The six-monih Nancy Bargcr impeachment saga is over. 

Campus Appeals Board decided this week thai Ihcy 
would not hear an appeal submiiicd by Mike Will, chair 
of IPSGA's iniemal affairs commiticc. 

Will wanted the appeals board to look into IPSGA's 
judicial court decision to drop impeachment charges 
against Bargcr. The charges were first brought against 
Barger in November of 1991 and judicial court ruled to 
drop [lie charges in January. 

Barger is once again an active member of student senaic 
but she said she is resigning Friday. 'The stress has got- 
icn to mc and I will be dropping all but one class, making 
me ineligible lo serve on senate." she said. 

Bargcr said she wasn't aU that thrilled about the deci- 
sion. "The appeals board shouldn't have ever been 
involved." she said. 

Will said he wasn't pleased with the decision but he 
didn't fault the Board. "As far as I'm. concerned, it's all 
over. I wasn't happy with the decision but they did it all 
by the book and that's the imporlart ihing." 



SUMMER JOB FAIR COMING 
TO IFF W MARCH 25 

Students looking for summer employment can attend 
IPFW's 12ih annual Summer Job Fair on Wednesday. 
March 25, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The fair will take place 
in the Walb Memorial Union Balh-oom. 

The fair is expected to altract 40 comparues, small busi- 
nesses and summer camps who are looking for full-time 
employees. The fair is sponsored by IPFW Career 
Services and the Student Employment Service. 

Mary Brant, coordinator of Student Employment 
Services, estimates tliat 500 students will spend the after- 
noon searching for employment and networking with 
local and national corporations and organizations. 

"The convenience of having the employers on campus 
allows the students lo participate in one-stop job seek- 
ing," Brant said. "Providing opportunities for employ- 
ment that relates to a student's major is important for 
future access to the job mailcct," stated Brant. 

Admission to the job fair is free lo all area high school, 
and college students. For more information, contact 
IPFW Career Services at (219) 481-6595. 



SCHOOL OF MUSIC 
TO PRESENT OPERAS 

Two one-act operas featuring IPFW music majors will 
be presented on the IPFW campus on March 28 and 29. 

The two pieces arc: "Not in Front of the Waiter" by 
Offenbach, and "Sweet Betsy from Pike" by Bucci. Also 
included in the presentation will be the University 
Singers' rendition of "The Polovetsian Dances" by 
Borodian. 

Joseph Meyers, associate professor of music and direc- 
tor of the operas, says the two one-acts will appeal to the 
public. 

"These (operas) are appealing because they're not long 
or heavy, like people tend lo ihink operas are." said 
Meyers. The two gently spoof grand operas, according to 
Meyers, further broadening their charm. 

"Sweet Betsy from Pike" will go in front of a tough 
audience on March 23 and 24 when it will be presented to 
some 1,800 fourth- and fifth-graders in the Walb 
Memorial Ballroom. 

The general public performances will be held in the 
Neff Recital Hall. The March 28 show will begin at 8 
p.m., and the March 29 performance starts at 2:30 p.m. 
For ticket information, phone the IPFW music depart- 
ment at 481-6714.

Construction on campus 'going nicely' 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Features Editor 
Although cunent campus con- 
struction is an inconvenience, 
Don Katter, physical plant direc- 
tor, said Ihc new additions will 
create a great boom. 
Kaiier said the two main con- 



struction sites arc the dicatct, 
which will be connected to the 
Fine Aris Building, and the 
Engineering and Technology 
Building, which is east of Neff 
Hall. 
The thcaler, according to 
Kaiter. is "progressing nicely." 



He said even though construc- 
tion was contracted through 
September, it will be completed 
by July. The building will 
house the department offices, 
and a 299-scat dieaicr. 

The second site, the 
Engineering and Technology 




Even though there have been a few problem;*, the construction of the tivo new buildings is goinj 
well, according to Don Katter director of Physical Plant. Photo by Chris Sheldon 



building, is not progressing as 
quickly as die dicatcr. 

The building was also con- 
iracled Uirough September, but 
Katter expects construclion 
through November. "There 
were problems early in die pro- 
ject thai set back the work, 
which crcaicd strife," Katier 
said. 

Problems, Kailcr said, includ- 
ed foundauon and soil coniami- 
naiion. He said when crews 
broke ground a suong gasoline 
scent seeped from the soil. 
Later he said Ihcy discovered 
thai the coniamination was 
caused from an old leaking fuel 
lank thai was buried there before 
IPFW opened. 

Kaltcr added thai investiga- 
tions inio the gasoline spill con- 
cluded die coniamination posed 
no threat to students. 
Consinicuon workers at die site 
refused lo confirm or deny 
Kallcr's siatcmcni. 

Another problem bodi students 
and workers have experienced is 
traffic congestion, Kailcr said. 
He said it is necessary for trucks 
to block roadways. 'That's the 
way progress is," He said, "We 
can't just drop buildings from 
the sky." 

Katter said a posidve aspect of 
the construclion projects has 
been the weather. "Our mild 
winter allowed ihc workers lo 
kccp-on building." 

The builders, Kalier explained, 
only lost three days of work 
because of weather. He added 
thai even when wealher condi- 
lions were a hindrance, the 
builders worked inside where it 



was sheltered. 

Kailcr said consirucUon prob- 
lems arc only going lo increase 
as summer gets closer. He said 
several new projects arc already 
in die works. 

Parking lots 4 and 5. Kaiter 
said, will be resurfaced. He also 
said lots 7 and 8 will be modi- 
fied so Ihc entrances line up 
widi Gold Drive. The cxisdng 
drives of lots 7 and 8 will be 
closed, and several trees will be 
removed. 

The trees lo be cut down, 
KaUcr explained, arc not special 
specimen trees. The specimen 
u-ccs will remain iniaci, he said. 

This summer a new campus 
entrance will be paved, Kaiter 
added. He said the entrance 
from Crescent Avenue will 
become die main entrance, and 
die roadway will end at Broyles 
Drive with an inlet at Uic Walb 
Memorial Union circle. 

"If people can get used to it, it 
will make it a loi easier for peo- 
ple getting in and out of the 
campus," said Katter. 
Meanwhile, he said the road- 
work will be a pain for die sum- 
mer session students. 

Further renovations, according 
to Kaltcr, will include emer- 
gency telephones, which will be 
completed in about two weeks, 
and more landscaping around 
the gazebo. 

Katter said aldiough ihe con- 
struction and rcnovaUons tem- 
porarily inconvenience students, 
they will cveniually help stu- 
dents and improve the campus. 



Private student records 
safe with IPFW system 



By Janet Ausbury 
Staff Writer 

Students who woridcr about 
Ihe safely and privacy of their 
IPFW records need not worry. 
Although occasional problems 
have been known to occur, 
IPFW safeguards the privacy of 
student dala. 

The registrar's office carefully 
screens requests for inforniaiion 
about studcnis, according lo 
Norman Greenbcrg, associate 
rcgisuar. The office docs not 
honor requests made by phone 
and requests made in person 
must be accompanied by the 
reason for request and die names 
of persons who will be receiving 
the information, he said. 

A memo issued by Greenbcrg 
on March 9 to all deans, division 
directors, and department chairs, 
detailed what is u&gt; be considered 
public informaiion and encour- 
aged memo recipients lo direct 
all requests for information to 
the registrar's office. 

Greenberg said that directing 
all requests lo the registrar's 
office would allow the office 
to keep tighter control over the 
flow of information leaving the 
university. 

"We do lend to go a Utile 
above the letter of Ihe law 
in protecting students," 
■Norman Greenberg 

The flow of informauon within 
die univcrsily is more lax. said 
Greenbcrg, but even faculty and 
administrators who ask for daia 
on siudenLs are given the infor- 
mauon on a nccd-to-know basis. 

Information that mighi be 
requested inieraally to IPFW arc 
crcdii-hour/GPA requirements 
for siudenl govemmenl eligibili- 
ty, which arc requested by the 
Dean of StudenLs' office, and 
GPA requirements for nomina- 
tion to "Who's Who in 
American College Sludenls." 
which are requested by the 
Director of Student Aciivilies' 
office. 

In both cases, the requesting 
departments receive only a yes 
or no answer from ihe registrar's 
office as to siudcnis' eligibility. 
Specifics such as exact GPA or 
number of credit hours arc not 
provided to the requesting 
dcpanmenls. 

Greenbcrg noicd diat in some 
cases, such as an academic 
appeal, qualitative data such as a 
siudcm's GPA might need lo be 
provided to an administrator. 



Greenbcrg feels ihc security of 
student data at IPFW is above 
average. In fact. IPFW is 
among several colleges that 
were recently told by die federal 
governmcnl to provide more 
information on graduate candi- 
dates or lose their relationship 
widi die govcmmenL 

"We do tend to go a liiilc 
above Ihe letter of the law in 
protecting students." said 
Greenberg, noting ihat his office 
keeps records of any student 
data released outside die univer- 
sity. He noied also diat qualita- 
dve data is not released vvidioui 
a student's permission. 

Greenberg recalled only one 
instance in the last two years 
when a student complained 
about informaiion released out- 
side ihc university. In ihis par- 
ticular case, a bank vice-presi- 
dent requested information 
about the siudenl. This inci- 
dent is being handled by lawyers 
for Purdue-West Lafayette, he 
said. 

The potential for misuse of 
information within the universi- 
ty is somewhat higher dian thai 
of information released to indi- 
viduals not connected with 
IPFW, said Greenbcrg. Mosi 
departments keep their own 
individual records on siudenls, 
and it is up to ihe departmenis lo 
handle dial information proper- 
ly, said Greenbcrg. 

When asked if he had ever 
received a cdmplainl about mis- 
use of siudenl informaiion by 
someone within IPFW, 
Greenbcrg recalled one instance 
in which a siudenl employee of 
IPFW obtained and misused 
information about another stu- 
dent. Appropriate disciplinary 
action was taken against the stu- 
dent employee, he added. 

According to Greenbcrg, a 
Request for Siudenl 
Employment Access to Student 
Informaiion Sysicms form is m 
development and may be ready 
for use by fall 1992, The fomi 
will furiher restrici siudcnt 
employee access to other siu- 
denLs' data. 
"This form was in development 
beforehand, but (the student 
employee incident) probably 
expedited acceptance of it," said 
Greenbcrg. 

Editors Note: First, of two 
part story will continue next 
week.

detailed for upcoming election 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief

has been a student senator 
since October of 1991, WiU 
served as chair of the iniemal 
affairs commiitec in IPSGA. 

He said he hopes to improve

major goals is to bring a 
major concert to our cam- 
pus," added Oplingcr. 

Vice President of Finance 

Two students arc running 
for this job. Bob Coffee 
would be new lo students 
government if elected, but he 
says his life experience and 
die fact diat he is a marketing 
major help qualify him. 

"I want to work wiih people 
in the odier offices to make 
sure things are done righl and 
in a timely fashion." Coffee 
said. 

"There have been a lot of 
forces fighting against each

of that is removed." 

Seemab Rasheed is the 
odier siudcnt running for the

Cut administrative fat 
to pay part-time faculty 



Tlic university has opted lo use underpaid 
associate faculty members lo deal wilh 
increased enrollment and rising opcraling 
costs. 

IPFW adminisiraiors advocaie the use of 
diese faeitliy members as ihc only rational 
way to offer students a quality education at an 
affordable cost. 

These associate faculty members arc being 
exploited. Many work just as haid as full- 
lime professors, yci they arc paid what 
amounts to less than minimum wage. 

Il is nearly impossible for many associate 
facully members to offer dicir students quali- 
ty in the classroom. Part-time faculty arc 
often left without offices, leaving their slij- 
dcnis to track them down before or after 
class, provided the teachers don't have to run 
off to jobs that actually help pay the rem. 

The 155-member administration whines ihai 
there is no other rational method of culling 
costs. 

Fredrick Kirchhoff, chair of the English 
dcparUncnl. claims thai associate faculty arc 
often belter teachers than the full-time facul- 
ty- 

If it is true that some of the associate faculty 
members are beuer teachers dian the full-time 



professors, then il is lime for the students to 
demand that the university fire die lousy full- 
time professors and hire the qualified associ- 
ate faculty at fair wages. 

In diis lime of recession, major corporations 
are restructuring. Bellcore, a New Jersey- 
based telecommunications company, is firing, 
relocating, demoting, or offering the option of 
early retirement to supervisors who do not 
have at least eight people reporting to them. 

According to the latest statistics, IPFW 
employs 155 administrators for 334 full-lime 
professors and 333 associate faculty members 
at IPFW. 

Using Bellcore's cuts as a model, IPFW 
should fire about a third of its administrators. 

While using associate faculty as indentured 
scr\'ants may minimize cost, it is not a good 
mcdiod to offer studcnis ihe quality, afford- 
able education they deserve. 

IPFW would be bcUcr-off cutting the num- 
ber of employees and offering f^r compensa- 
tion to the qualified instructors who remain. 

Most studcnis would rather be in a class of 
50 with a conlent, qualified instructor, dian 
be in a class of five with an underpaid, over- 
worked, fiy by night teacher. 



Cut operating costs 
not faculty wages 



To the Editor: 

Thank you for the article, "University Uses 
Associate Professors To Cut Costs," in the 
February 27 Communicatoi'. It points out the 
substantial contributions that underpaid and 
under-appreciated pan-time faculty make to 
educating IPf^ students. That abuse of 
these talented people helps cut costs is no 
joy- 
There are better ways to cut costs. The lat- 
est figures released by the university show an 
astonishing 155 adminisuaiors in charge of 
the institution's 334 faculty. Essentially all 
of these administrators are full-time work- 
ers — or, at least, arc supposed to work full- 
time. Among them are the highest-paid 
IPFW employees. 

Imagine how much students' educational 
costs could be cut if half of the campus's 
administrators were half-timers paid (like 
half-time associate faculty) S5,000 to S6,000 
per xatJemic year, hnaginc how much addi- 
tional classroom space and how many addi- 



tional courses could be provided if dicse part- 
time administrators were, like part-dme facul- 
ty, given essentially no office space. Imagine 
how much more convenient the campus 
would be for students if university offices 
were open in the evening, slalTed by part-time 
administrators who Qikc many pan-lime fac- 
ulty) hold daytime jobs elsewhere. 

The ratio of adminisiraiors to faculty on diis 
campus has been steadily. increasing in recent 
years, and among the results has been sub- 
stantially higher administrative overhead. 
IPFW students may be interested to know that 
the administration is proposing an 8 percent 
fee increase for next year. How much of this 
additional money will be used to fund the hir- 
ing of more full-time administrators has not 
yet been determined.

IPFW cheats faculty 



To (he Editor: 

1 am dismayed diat E&gt;avid McCants believes 
that the way to cut costs at IPFW is lo break 
die backs of die associate faculty on slave 
wages. He claims IPFW is affordable only 
because of low associate faculty wages. The 
university budget is large enough to increase 
these salaries, if the administration stops 
wasting money in the wrong places. Many 
departments can afford to fill faculty mail- 
boxes with unnecessary junk mail flyers. 
There's money lo purchase the "Wellness" 
program. In die summer, air condidoners run 
on the coldest selling. Departments fill 
offices with unnecessary new furniture. The 
Chancellor takes overseas plane trips, and 
there's cable TV in the lounges. Why arc 
these and other items of higher priority than 
salaries? 

1 object to die administration's attitude that 
only ihc associate faculty salaries are to be 
kept at miserly wages. If the university was 
serious aboui "cuidng costs dirough wages," 
die school would: use part-time administra- 
tors, pay administrators less, pay full-time 
faculty the same wage per course as part- 
time, stop paying die campus secreiarics and 
graduate siudeni instructors more than associ- 
ate faculty, and not give full-time faculty pay 
raises when part-timers receive no raise. 

McCants claims die universiiy wants "high 
quality teaching services," yet it is unwiUing 
to pay for diis or to provide part-time faculty 
with the classroom, supplies, a governing 



voice and the support diey need for leaching. 
One gets what one pays for and one docs not 
gel someihing for nothing, including good 
leaching. 

Fred Kirchhoff claims "some of the part- 
Umc faculty are better teachers dian full-time 
professors." If diis is true, then fire die inade- 
quate full-lime professors and save the school 
even mor\: money. Why are these poor teach- 
ers, then, given tenure while the better teach- 
ers are given nothing at all? The university 
seems to punish, not reward, quality teaching. 

Kirchhoff also states that full-time profes- 
sors must do oihcr duties while die part-time 
teacher "is only concerned with teaching." 
Yet in Kirchhoffs own department, associate 
faculty members arc expected to put in extra 
hours of unpaid lime on seminars, confer- 
ences and adminislralive paperwork. 

Hubbart claims he sees no problem in using 
part-time faculty. I do. It is not fair to expect 
a trained professional widi a graduate degree, 
and experience, to receive minimal pay for 
his or her talents. It is not fair when a full- 
time professor is paid six limes as much for 
teaching die very same class. The administra- 
tors who control the campus monies arc too- 
well compensated themselves to give faculty 
salaries a high priority. This salary policy 
may in die shoij term save students money. 
but in die long term cause high lumover and 
low morale among teachers.

Campus inactivity 

Student should get behind SAB 



To Ihe Editor 

This is written in response lo 
Becky Roady-Ladig, March 5, 
1992. 

Becky, I am a full-time hus- 
band and father, a full-time 
employee, and a full-time IPFW 
student. And (D) all of the 
above (plus more), I have all die 
time (and use) for "student 
activilics," and I willingly 
finance and support them each 
and every semester and summer 
session. 

I agree wjUi you that IPSGA is 
responsible for some lame and 
idiotic events on campus (i.e., 
bickering amongst themselves 
and trying to impeach each 
other). But I, as well as you. 
am responsible for voting diese 
individuals into office. 
However, these individuals are 
also students, spouses, parents, 
and employees, yet they take 
die lime to become involved, to 
care about our school. 



As long as "you" adults (I'm 
40 going on 15) are too busy, or 
think it is noi important enough 
to become concerned wilh, dien 
we righU"ully deserve the repre- 
scntadon diat we have. I sup- 
port the IPSGA and its mem- 
bers, J support our siudeni orga- 
nizations, and 1 support SAB 
and Ihe activities provided for 
our entertainment. Studcnis 
cannot live by schoolwork 
alone! 

Seriously, your letter is dis- 
turbing and saddening. It dis- 
turbs me that you hold such a 
narrow view of your school and 
your fellow students. I would 
hope dial you would see your 
education for what il is, a 
chance to learn, aiid not only 
from die professors and instruc- 
lors, but from each and every 
person that you meet Our stu- 
dent acdviiics allow this to take 
place and they give us all a 
chanceio grow from our expe- 



riences with others. This is not 
Bypass High or Fon Wayne U., 
this is Indiana University- 
Purdue University at Fort 
Wayne — IPFW. We have facul- 
ty and students that excel in 
research, leaching and acade- 
mics. We (IPFW) host count- 
less seminars and conferences 
and workshops diat are attended 
by leading researchers from 
around the world. We have 
nationally-ranked sports teams 
diat have die ability lo compete 
iniernationally. IPFW is also 
full of organizations such as 
Disabled Students Excelling in 
Leadership, fraternities and 
soforidcs, and Student Acdvides 
Board, among others. I'm proud 
of each and every one of them. 

Similarly, I'm saddened at die 
thought that your education is 
not complete for you. There is 
so much more than silling in a 
class and being lectured to. Yet, 
diere may be hope, perhaps you 



pardcipate in class discussions? 
Or do you sit sullenly and cry 
about your lackluster fate? It is 
terrible to think that you are 
missing out on some of the most 
wonderful years of your life. 

Thus, Becky, 1 challenge you, 
and all odiers, to make lime to 
become involved in our school 
and lo allow yourselves the 
chance to experience a full and 
exciting university here in Fort 
Wayne. I am willing lo take 
time lo assist you with this, I 
can be reached through the 
IPFW Psychology Club in Neff 
375. I'll be dierc— will you? 

Remember: If it is full- 
empty iL If it is empty — fill it, 
Ifitscratches— itch it. Don't let 
the struggles of life interfere 
with the pleasures of life. 

I'm willing to help and I'm 
wailing to do so.

'Honor death' tradition an ugly reality 



ByK.L.Caroff 
Staff Wriler 

Those of you who weren't cel- 
ebrating the riics of spring break 
might have caught a disturbing 
segment of the television news 
magazine "Prime Time Live," 
which aired last Thursday night. 

While I've always considered 
myself an information junkie, 
watching a segment on the cus- 
tom of "honor death" made me 
wish I'd tuned into "L.A. Law" 
instead. 

Il seems the 17- year-old 
daughter of Palestinian parents 
had committed the grave sin of 
becoming too American. Noi 
only had the Sl Louis teen taken 
a job at Wendy's, she had an 
African-American boyfriend as 
well. So one night her father 
Slabbed her to death while her 
mother held her down. Both 
parents arc now on death row. 

The FBI caught it all on tape, 
every word of it, every horrible, 
tragic scream. That's why the 



father's claim of self-defense 
didn't sit loo well with the 
American audiorilics, 

You're probably wondering 
why die FBI had die murder on 
tape. It seems that the father 



Commentary 



was suspected of PLC 
(Palestinian Liberation 

Organization) related activities 
and the family apartment had 
been bugged. 

When the tapes were translat- 
ed, not only was it clear dial die 
daughter had not come at the 
father with a knife (which was 
his defense), but dial the family 
had been discussing killi;ig her 
for some time prior to the actual 
event. 

Why didn't the FBI try to pre- 
vent the murder, if, in fact, they 
knew one might lake place? 
The reporter on "Prime Time 



Live" didn't have the answer to 
dial question. But he posed il. 

Was diis tragedy just an isolat- 
ed example of a familygonc 
berserk? Maybe noi. What it 
may have been, the reporter stat- 
ed, was an example of an 
ancient custom called "honor 
deadi." It is not a religious cus- 
tom or strictly an Arab custom 
(although the victim and her 
family were Muslims originally 
fi-om a Palestinian seldemcnt in 
Israel). Apparently, killing 
one's wife, sister or daughter for 
reasons of "family honor" is 
practiced in some Mediiemuiean 
countries as welt. 

The custom goes something 
hke diis: When a woman brings 
dishonor upon the family name 
(The perceived transgression 
seems to almost always involve 
sex.), good standing in die com- 
munity can only be restored 
through ihe killing of Ihe 
woman by a family member. 
The avenger is frequently the 



father or brother, but women 
will take part as well. 

The actual ritual involved isn't 
what struck mc as most horrible, 
however. It was ihe cxpendabil- 
ity of these women ihai made 
me sad and discouraged. Sure, I 
can tell myself diat these are iso- 
lated incidences of macho crazi- 
ness and dial we've come a long 
way baby. But I know dial's not 
really true. Even in diis country, 
we have die "die bitch was ask- 
ing for it" defense, which men 
successfully use when accused 
of "crimes of passion" against 
unfaithful wives and girlfriends. 
Never mind lhat a woman is 
dead - whether it be a case of 
"honor deaih" or a "crime of 
passion" - a man's gotta' do, 
what a man's gotta' do.

English associate faculty angered at pay scale inequity 



Page 3 



TolheF.di(ur: 

In your recent article "University 
uses associate faculty to cut cosis" 
(February 27. 1992), vice chancellor 
McCanls points to IPFW's increasing 
reliance on part-time faculty. As 
pan-lime faculty in the department of 
English, we question whether this par- 
ticular cost-cultJng practice is in the 
best interests of Ihc university commu- 
nity. There arc oiher options. 

The damage resulting from practices 
like the ones outlined by vice chancel- 
lor McCants has been a topic of 
nation-wide concern. The highly 
respected Modern Language 
Association (MLA) siaics that such 
practices "are already threatening ... 
academic excellence." The College 
Conference on Composition and 
Communication (CCCC) points to the 
resulting "crisis in education." 

The damage is to students as well as 
10 part-time faculty. As CCCC points 
out, Ihc result of these practices has 
been to "undermine the ability of 
teachers to teach and students to 
Icam." 

Conditions in the IPFW English 
department suggest that these siaie- 
menis more accurately reflect reality 
than promises based on a narrow view 
of cost-cutting benefits. 

Wc do not. however, speak for 
departments or programs other than 
English — and even here, we address 
only the program in composition. 

We— and the CCCC — recognize diat 
part-time teachers in other programs 
may offer a different point of view. 
particularly in journalism where the 
role of specialists is quite different In 
composition, further, we must not only 
be able to "communicate and talk in 
front of other people .... explain things 
and make them interesting," as jour- 
nalism part-timer Kerry Hubant says 
in your article. We mustaborely on a 
good deal of knowledge and experi- 
ence gained through graduate study. 
Wc do not so much contradict Mr, 
Hubarlt's staicmcnis, then, as we ask 
that he not be understood to speak for 
[hose of us in different programs. 

Specifically; wc address the use of 
part-time faculty in a college-wide 
composition program where graduate 
work in rhetoric and composition, and 
a master's degree beyond the 
Bachelor's arc required. 

We support a wctl-lhought-oui policy 
on the use of part-time faculty in com- 
position, 

Wc do not suppon practices that lead 
to the conditions under which current 
p;m-lime faculty in English work. 

Gross pay is S3.80 per hour for work 
expected of part-lime faculty in 
English. The workload includes Lime 
spent in leaching, class preparation, 
and other duties expected of all part- 
timers. 

In English the workload also consists 
of lime spent in reading, commenting 
on, and evaluating student papers — 
and drafts of student papers. 

Part-time faculty are also denied 
health care insurance and other essen- 
tial benefits. Nor can Ihey increase 
take-home pay by increasing [heir 
teaching loads. Pan-timers are limited 
to two courses per semester. They 
may teach three courses only in an 
emergency. 

When compared to the pay received 
by a lecturer in composition, morc-

over, pay for part-iimc faculty is 
inequitable. A beginning lecturer 
receives very modest pay — S20,000 
per year. A beginning part-timer 
receives S4.768 for the two allowed 
courses for two semesters — a cut of 
almost 75 percent. The lecturer also 
receives the health care and other 
essential benefits denied the part- 
timer. 

This pay inequity cannot be justified 
because of a difference in education 
required, or research expected. A lec- 
turer m composition, like Ihc part- 
timer, needs only the master's degree. 
Neither the lecturer or Ihe pan-timer is 
required to do research: boih posi- 
tions arc leaching positions only. 

The subsiandard pay cannot be justi- 
fied, either, as part of an IPFW sys- 
tem-wide occurrence. Pay for part- 
lime faculty in the IPFW English 
department is significantly below that 
for pan-lime faculty in other schools 
at IPFW. 

The damage to our morale, dignity 
and self-respect is incalculable. 

The damage is also to students, ll 
may be reflected in die difficulties wc 
have in setting up times for an 
appointment. Or it may be reflected 
when wc are not available weekdays 
(or evenings) on campus — because we 
have to report to ihc job wc maintain 
for financial suppon. 

There are other consequences. 

The pay scale. Ihe lack of health care 
insurance and other benefits, the lack 
of pnafessional status, and the general 
disregard in which part-time faculty 
are frequently held, have come togelh- 
cr lo create exceptionally low morale 
in the English department. 

Ai the same time, we have had an 
unusually high rate of turnover. In 
1991 alone, 34 associate faculty and 
instructors {out of a core workforce of 
50) left teaching in Ihc Enghsh depan- 
ment. Normal attrition does not 
account for ihis kind of turnover. The 
working conditions of pan-lime facul- 
ty do. 

What, then, is the damage lo stu- 
dents? 

The continuing heller- skelter created 
by such a rapid turnover has meant a 
lack of coherence in ihe program, a 
demonstrable difficulty with 
iiy in courses,~a clear unevenncss in 
instruction — and, sometimes, the 
thwarting of any desire a student 
might have to work with a pan-time 
faculty member for more than a 



semester. 

In shon, the consistency of a stable 
workforce has been given over to an 
anarchy of the perpetually rccruilcd. 

This is not to say — and we would 
emphasize our point here — that scnioi 
composition faculty lack competence 
or good will. {They do not.) Nor is ii 
to say that ihey do not put forth extra- 
ordinary effort to maintain the pro- 
gram. (They do.) 

The working conditions of part-time 
faculty arc such that there will contin- 
ue to be— iintil wc are accorded digni- 
ty and respect and decent pay — an 
anarchy of the perpetually rccnjiicd. 

What we are suggesting, of course, is 
ihai die problems are widi the system, 
not the people. And this wc believe is 
iruc not only for senior composition 
faculty, but for part-time faculty as 
well. 

As pan-time faculty in English, we 
have the qualifications: as we've said, 
we all have master's degrees. We 
have teaching experience. Many of us 
have published academic research and 
given paper; at conferences. Others of 
us have gone big name — the latest is 
publication in the Wall Street Journal. 

Our in-class performance is also sig- 
nificant, both to the students wc teach 
and lo the senior composition faculty 
who reappoint us. In-class perfor- 
mance is, of course, measured by stu- 
dent evaluations. In ihc English 
department, student evaluations of the 



in-class performance of pan-time fac- 
ulty arc given serious consideration by 
the senior faculty who determine 
whether or not we continue to teach. 

Slill. there is a problem. Under a 
system that fosters perpetual recruit- 
ment, the weed-out factor has no 
force. Although ineffective faculty 
arc weeded out and not re-appoinled, a 
system of perpetual recruitment opens 
everything up again, to the good and 
bad alike. There is no tendency 
toward eliminating the incffeclivc by 
maintaining those who are good. 

Development of a stable leaching 
core, shaped by the evaluations stu- 
dents provide, and maintained by 
practices that encourage long-term 
commilmenl, seems the better alterna- 
tive. The way is at hand: grant digni- 
ty, respect, and decent pay. 

Not all problems will be easily 
solved. Wc do not think, however, 
that Ihc only options are those "the 
students may not like" (your quote of 
McCanls). 

As a way lo begin discussion, wc 
would suggest, first, that the university 
review its policy toward unlimiied 
growth. To increase enrollment so 
that it continues to move beyond the 
university's ability to provide for it is 
not in anyone's best interest. It may 
be that growth should be slowed, and 
the cost increases that come with 
growth slowed down, unlil we can 
provide decent pay lo those who work

here. 

Second we would suggest a re-exam- 
inaiion of the role of administrators al 
IPFW. We would ask how much of 
the increase in administrators to facul- 
ty has been necessary. With the cur- 
rent ratio, almost one administrator to 
each two faculty, we would ask what 
mighl be done to create a leaner 
administrative staff so that pari-umc 
faculty and others currcnily underpaid 
might receive equitable pay. 

Practices that cut costs al the expense 
of student education are, as wc have 
noted, a concern of the Modern 
Language Association and die College 
Conference on Composition and 
Communication. 

We have seen the effects of such 
practices here at IPFW in the English 
department, 

Wc are, then, puzzled by McCants' 
seeming support for these practices. 

In suggesting allcmaiives, we hope 



to put an end to thinking based on dol- 
lars and nonsense. Wc look toward a 
university community where students 
and faculty alike arc granted the digni- 
ty and respect appropriate to die work 
wc together undertake.

It's easy to get fat the 'Walker Way' 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

Ladies and gentlemen ... from parts 
unknown, weighing in at 225 pounds, 
I'm the challenger "Calypso" Jim 
Walker. 

And by some dark twist of fate, you 
have rested your weary eyes upon the 
Obiruse Angle. 

Before you return your shecp-likc 
gaze to the MTV video you were 
watching. I'd like to encourage you to 
read my little biweekly conservative 
Republican political column which is 
brimming, as always, with potent 
social comment. 

DIET PLAN - I've become quite a 
zcppclin this winter. 

No, 1 didn't Icam the flute pans to 
"Stairway to Heaven." I'm talking 
about my ballooning waistline. 

Last week, when it was sdll spring. 1 
dug through my land-fill closet and 
found my "lucky shons." These shorts 
arc pink and blue plaid and loud 
enoiigh to make golfers cry. 

When 1 tried to button my "lucky 
shorts," 1 noticed they were a little 
tight. I tried to stretch them out by 
pulling on the waist but 1 only man- 
aged to pop off the button. My "lucky 
shorts" were too small. , 

1 immediately searched for someone 
to blame. "My housekeeper Alice 
must have washed them in scalding 
hot water!"! ranted. 

"Or maybe someone borrowed my 
shorts without asking and stained them 
with punch. Then racked with guilt, 
the illicit borrower bought another pair 
just like mine and put them back into 
the closet. Bui the replacement shorts 
were a size too small!" I raved. 

It could have happened. 

Or 1 could have chunked-out this 
winter, I tried on my other shorts;, 
none of ihcm fit. I realized then that 
I'd become a lard-butt. I knew I had, 
in fact, expanded. 

How could this have happened to 
mc? Maybe my diet is to blame. Let's 
take a look at what 1 usually eat during 
an average day: 7 a.m. - pancakes wilJi 
bacon, 7:30 a.m. - more bacon! 8 a.m. 
- sleep off breakfast, 4 p. m. - McRib 
Extra Value Meal, 7 p.m. - Skittles 
break, 8 p.m. - big bag of Comuts. 12 
a.m. - extra cut size rare steak and 
hash browns, and Overnight - one bag 
of Soft Batch chocolate chip cookies.

Okay, 1 might need to trim my food 
intake. I should at least cut out foods 
high in fat and sugar. Hmm, that 
leaves me with the Comuts and what 
else? I'm glad I really like them 
Comuts. 

Well if the diet thing doesn't work 
out so well, I could try for some more

VoUydons shake West Coast 



By Joe Heersche 
SporU Editor 

The Vollcydons recorded ihcir most 
successful trip lo the West Coast over 
the spring-break vacauon. 

Facing four learns ranked in ihc lop 
twenty. No. 6 IPFW came home with 
ihrcc victories and one defeat. Then 
ranked No. 5. the USC Trojans, No, 
16 U.C. -Irvine, and No.18 Loyola 
Marymounl, ail fell victim lo the 
Volleydons, Only No. 11 U.C.-Santa 
Barbara escaped IPFW's determina- 
tion to prove their ranking on enemy 
lurf, 

USC: 12-15,15-4,15-12,15-8 

Proving their win in Fort Wayne on 
February 1 was not a fluke. IPFW 
again beat the Trojans in ihcir first 
match of Ihc road trip. 

The Vollcydons did not have an easy 
time of it as they did in the three- 
game sweep in Fort Wayne. The 
'Dons lost the first game 12-13 to 
USC. Facing the Trojans' home fans 
and volleyball skeptics, the 
Volleydons dropped the first game as 
sophomore Norman Almodovar strug- 
gled with passing. 

In the second game the Vollcydons 
settled down and were able to hit 40 
percent. For the last three games of the 
match, IPFW hit 37 percent and had 
61 kills. The Vollcydons held USC to 
only 22 percent for the match. 

Lloy Ball, a 6-foot-8-inch sopho- 
more setter, set a school record, 13 
block assists and two solo blocks for a 
toial of 15. The Volleydons set a team 
record with 42 block assists. 

Raul Papaleo had 22 kills and Ball 
had 59 assists for IPFW. 

Loyola Marymounl: 14-16, 15-11, 
15-8,15-3 

IPFW's second match started much 
the same as the first with a defeat. 

The Vollcydons lost the rirsi game to 
Loyola Marymount 14-16. IPFW led 
6-1 at one point, but eight serving 
errors and seven blocking errors 
quickly lost the lead. 

The Volleydons once again warned 
up in the second game, and really got 
hot in the fourth game as Norman 
Almodovar served six straight points. 

The Vollcydons tied two school 
records in the match. With Almodovar 
contributing five serving aces, IPFW

Lady 'Dons win 
NCAA berth 

By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Tbe Lady 'Dons faced league-lead- 
ing and oncc-bealcn St. Joseph's on 
Saturday night in their final game of 
the regular season. It was also the 
chance for a bid lo participate in the 
post-season NCAA Division n louma- 
menL 

Wilh All-America candidate Lisa 
Miller scoring 25 points, and Pam 
Edwards adding 22, the Lady 'Dons 
extended their season by at least one 
more game, 

IPFW was able to build a seven- 
point lead will"! 1:30 to play and widi- 
slood a Si. Joseph's charge to win by 
one. 63-62, 

The win tilted the scales in favor of 
IPFW, though the Lady "Dons' 22-6 
record built a strong argument for 
their selection for the lournament. 
The win placed IPFW in a lie for sec- 
ond place in ihe Great Lakes Valley 
Conference final standings with a 14-4 
record. 

The invitation marks the second time 
the Lady 'Dons have competed in the 
NCAA Division 11 lourney with the 
first two years ago. Whal makes this 
inviialion so special is thai coach 
Eileen KJeinfclter was able lo accom- 
plish this goal in her first season of 
coaching at IPFW. 

However, much like two years ago, 
the Lady 'Dons were beat in ihc first 
game. The Lady "Dons traveled to 
Pittsburg. Kansas, lo face 25-4 
Washburn and lost by a score of 82- 
67. 

IPFW got behind early as ihcy lumed 
Ihe ball over four times and Washburn 
sprinted to an 8-0 start. Washburn 
would increase the score lo 11-1 in the 
next few minutes. IPFW never led in 
the game but early in the second half 
diey were able to cul the lead lo four 
once before losing by 15 points. 

Lisa Miller scored 20 points while 
Pam Edwards added 11 points and II 
rebounds in the loss. Shelly Sands had 
ten points for IPFW.
