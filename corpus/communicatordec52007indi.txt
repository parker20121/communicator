The Network Six Degrees From the Fortjimbaland 

Diamond in the rough, the college dropout dream: Part One 

Medium rare steak and a Yoohoo comprises the raw child - like sadsfying enjoyment of doing what you want, even if it means com- 
promising a full college education. While some pursuits require the dedicated commitment of a four - year program, the keys that open 
doors to the music industry have an agenda that comes to your window when it feels like it. Heck, what big opportunity doesn't? 

Producing music may sound fun (pun intended). At least it's pretty easy to 
listen, groove, and move to. Especially if it's a Timbaland, shock value, world re- 
nowned, super producer, slash brand - trademark - registered, who has tapped the 
cheeks of dozens, nay, hundreds of beats and songs we listen to on the radio. 

Tapping different markets of music, the network that is Timbaland is "huge- 
ongus," evolutionary, and as Duran Duran has noted, durable and effective. 

Pacing in a Ft. Wayne kitchen, engineer, mid-move Berklee College of Music 
drop - out, and self - proclaimed genious, Kia Eshghi, has stumbled upon a key. 

"Try audio genius," Eshghi boasts confidently with less than 72 hours to 
align, enhance, tune, repetitively listen to, tighten, remodulate and reinvent the 
heck out of some guy that is huge in France, Timbaland happens to be producing. 

Go figure, Timbaland globalizes, and uses Americans as outsourced labor- 
Homeland Security, green alert! 

How about green for Euros, the currency that speaks for music industry mo- 
guls, trumping the value of the dollar, and broadening the chance for opportunity 
here in the U.S. with higher pay incentive. 

To get that green, a process of unspeakable deadlines, relendessly special- 
ized musicians, and a coincidentally convenient connection comes to play for 
brjmd name sensitive ears, targeted for world wide consumers.

From Page 1 

A piece of the 
pie is having what as- 
piring producer, Steve 
Spears calls "good 
laste in talent- why 
would you want to 
network with people 
who," what audio pro- 
ducer and engineer, 
Carl Bleke describes 
as "have more to 
learn from (people), 
if they're better than 
you." 

Spears and 
Bleke, Fort Wayne na- 
tives both dropped 
out of Berklee Col- 
lege of Music, Bos- 
ton, Massachusetts, 
and have been doing 
what they've wanted 
to since 2006- mak- 
ing music and being 
patient - patient for a 
call from Eshghi who 
has stopped in Fort 
Wayne from his move 
from Arizona to New 
York, merely to track 
vocals with Bleke, one 
time roommate, col- 
laborator, and Boston 
connection. 

The call origi- 
nally came from Koil, 
the tracking engineer, 
who recorded the 
French guy in Tim- 
baland's home studio 
in Virginia. Koil, who 
worked with Eshghi 
at Guitar Center and 
collaborated musical- 
ly, had four days from 
that point to perfect 
the vocals. Eshghi 
picks up the phone 
and less than 48 hours 
later has an expressed 
package of five Tim- 



haiand beats to work 
with and Carl's studio 
in Fort Wayne to work 
on it. 

Pressure on. 

The childhood 
dream, crushing 'fire- 
fighter' and 'astronaut' 
has produced linger- 
ing shrapnel after 
Berklee with "enough" 
contacts, making the 
network that is sL\ de- 
grees of Timbaland 
that much more of a 
twilight zone. 

Carl sips on 
his cocoa, clicks, and 
'space bars' dramati- 
cally as lime turn 
- tables, Eshghi freaks 
out, and Spears mixes 
drinks. The environ- 
ment is sound. Instru- 
ments, cords, luggage, 
and burnt cookies lit- 
ter the ambiance. Pro- 
duction in the control 
room, unorganized 
chaos in the living 
room, a pet cat named 
Mooger Fooger laps 
Ihe space leisurely, 
dryly, unaware and at- 
tentive, as Bryan Cho, 
an aspiring artist from 
New Jersey, chills, con- 
sults, bakes, and griUs, 
slash burns cookies. 

Cho, originally 
from Korea, "born and 
raised, just got my citi- 
zenship in January," is a 
slack rocker, "rock that 
has a good idea, but 
executed half ■ ass," 
according to Spears, 
Eshghi, and Cho. who 
collaborated on the 
definition. He's travel- 
ing with Eshghi to New 




York to help move the 
sound genius who will 
produce his version 
and interpretation of 
rock. 

Ultimately, 
they're drawing from 
each other in a process 
of making a name for 



themselves- a name 
each of them could 
hope be as relevant as' 
Timbaland's. 

But how rel- 
evant can a couple of 
college dropouts be? 



Look for 'Part Two' of 
this series on experi- 
ence, opportunity, 
and education, next 
semester, January 14.

Market may perk up for the holidays 

The Fed considering freezing interest rates to help homebuyers 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

RuchjIOieipfw.edu 



T\vo thousand -seven 
has been a rough year 
for consumers. Crude 
oil prices reached an all- 
lime high of almosl SlOO 
per barrel, and ihe hous- 
ing market has been de- 
clining steadily with hlile 
expectation of improve- 
ment in sight, causing 
consumers to hold onto 
their money. 

According to analysis 
the major economy de- 
terminer has been the 
plummeting housing 
market. Adjustable rate 
mortgages may be to 
blame. 

These loans offer initial 
low interest rates that re- 
set at a much higher rate 
down the road. Those 
with weak credit are of- 
ten the borrowers who 



end up with a much 
higher interest rate. 
while those with excel- 
lent credit tend to have 
a lower interest rate. 

The Fed recently has 
been considering freez- 
ing interest rates at the 
current figure in order 
to help unlock the cred- 
it crunch and free hom- 
eowners from the llireat 
oFlosing their homes. 

Foreclosures in Oc- 
tober 2007 have more 
than doubled compared 
to October 2006 fig- 
ures. According to Re- 
altyTl'ac, the number of 
home foreclosure filings 
jumped by 94 percent 
from one year earlier. 

Treasury secretary 
Henry Paulson said Fri- 
day that these motions 
are Intended to help Ihe 
"middle group" of bor- 
rowers; those who have 
the resources to own a 
home, but cannot af- 




ford another hike in the 
interest rates. 

Because of the an- 
nouncement to freeze in- 
terest rates, the stock mar- 
ket increased trade and 
ended on a positive note 
last week. 

This boon to the market 
has come just in time For 



the "middle group" of 
holiday shoppers who 
may be rethinking how 
they spend their money 
and how much gasoline 
they use to get to their 
shopping destination. 

IPFW alumnus Kalhi 
Lyvers said, "The dollar 
amount doesn't really 



change per se, but I am 
more conscious about 
planning when I go shop- 
ping. Now I try to go 
shopping all at once to 
conserve resources. I'm 
even more conscious of 
where I drive and try to 
shop in one trip instead 
of many." 



Facebook, ABC to cover '08 race 



By CARL JAEGER 

U-WIRE 



ABC News and the pop- 
ular social networking 
site Facebook announced 
a partnership Monday in 
providing coverage of the 
2008 presidential elec- 
tion. 

According to ABC News, 
the partnership will in- 
clude up-to-date news 
on each candidate's cam- 
paign trail as well as in- 
teractive forums, discus- 
sion boards and blogs. 

"We thought it would 
be a great opportunity 
for us to make available 
to the people already 
having the ongoing dis- 
cussion and debate on 
Facebook the full range 
of ABC News political 
reporting," ABC News 
President David Weston 
said in a release. 

In addition to adding 
the U.S. News applica- 
tion, Facebook users will 
be able to "friend" ABC 
News reporters who ivill 
be following election 
events. Tlie reporters ivill 
provide updated infor- 
mation on blogs, upload 
photographs and be- 
hind-the-scenes election 
footage. 

"The goal is to extend 
the debate from being 
a one-hour session that 
happens on television to 
a dialogue that can take 
place before, after and 
now during the debate 



between voters," said 
Facebook vice president 
.of husinGss develop- 
ment Dan Bose. 'We're 
all about providing 
technology platforms 
to enable and facilitate

litical information is get-

ivas unsure of the media's 
effectiveness. 



among social groups." 

Downs also s^d politi- 
cians should be careful 

not to "pander young 
people" on Facebook, as 
it could potentially ef- 
fect the perception of 




information flow and 
dialogue." 

As of Monday night, 
the U.S. News Facebook 
application had 4,591 
active users. Facebook 
currently has more 
then 53 million users in 
55,000 networks worid- 
wide — and according 
to the site, the user de- 
mographic group that 
is growing the most is 
those over 25. 

Tlie partnership bc- 
t\veen ABC Nexvs and 
Facebook comes on the 



public. The Democratic 
CNN YouTube debate 
took place luly 23 and 
Ihe Republican debate is 
scheduled to take place 
Wednesday. 

UW political science pro- 
fessor Donald Downs said 
the various forms of new 
media "arc a reality, and 
it makes sense for politi- 
cians to take advantage of 
them." 

"If you don't, your op- 
ponents will, so It's kind of 
like an arms race with the 
media, " Downs said. 



"1 think that the [infor- 
malion] is indeed get- 
ting out to people who 
wouldn't normally see it, 
[butj whether this means 
that these people will ac- 
tually vote or get involved 
is another story," Downs 
said. "1 personally think 
thai if this is their first, 
or only exposure, then 
these are not the types 
of people who would 
vote, in any event. But if 
you do well in this con- 
text, it is free advertising, 
and could create a buzz 



the candidate from older 
generations. 

"The benefits would 
be reaching a broader 
audience," Downs said. 
"The downside is that 
older people can look ri- 
diculous trying to appear 
'cool.' A good politician 
can walk this line — a bad 
politician will stumble." 
Individuals who want to 
add the application can 
do so by searching "U.S. 
News" on Facebook.

V\'hile from the flood 
of student editorials I've 
read recendy about how 
the presidential election 
cycle is just too... long... 
you wouldn't know it, 
we're an approaching a 
point soon when actual 
voters will make deci- 
sions leading to actual 
candidates securing the 
nominations of their par- 
lies. Why, then, do most 
of the college ivrilers ad- 
dressing the field contin- 
ue to treat matters as if 
we were still in the presi- 
dential "silly season," 
where stuff like haircuts,- 
wardrobe choices and 
knowing Chuck Norris 
matters more than legiti- 
mate policy? 

In my role as the opin- 
ion editor for UWire, 1 
read about fifty etection- 
themed columns and ed- 
itorials a week. It's 'a task 
that if approached in the 
wrong spirit could really 
make a person cynical, 
but on the whole, since 
the pre-9/11 days of my 
own college newspaper 
apprenticeship, student 
journalists have become 
far more politically en- 
gaged and a good deal 
more varied and original 
in their opinions on tlie 
topic. 

However, while college 
columnists care more 
about the presidential 
race than they did in 1996 
or 2000, from my reading 
it seems as if they feel no 
more confident about 
their own ability to effect 
change on the process. 

This leads to some in- 
teresting examples of 
cognitive dissonance. For 
example, every few days 
I will scan a new piece, 
that bemoans the lack of 
voter turnout among the 
coUege-aged and other 
young adults, lust about 
as frequently, I'll be sent 
a story that begs, pleads, 
cajoles or outright orders 
Republicans to stop be- 
ing so driven by Christian 
values. The point that 
either type of article sel- 
dom makes is that unlike 
most 19-year-old self- 
styled atheist intellectu- 
als, evangelicals vole — 
reliably and usually with 
one voice. TYying to per-

%vyfw[&gt;S'iS9}f! 



By KATHRYN ANDERSON 
AndeknOIOipfw.edj 



With the turmoil and 
stresses of first semester 
coming to an end, one 
may find themselves 
wondering how they will 
amuse themselves dur- 
ing the long winter break. 
Here are a few possible 
suggestions to make your 
break both relaxing and 
resourceful. 



1. WalkarounddowntownFortWayne, for &amp;ee, with family friends, or a ■ 
significant other and behold the ^gantic Santa display and other festive decora- " 
tions. 

2. Embarkonanoldhohdaytraditionwithyourfriendsbydrivingthrough I 
the Fantasy of Lights at Franke Park, which has over 75 different displays. The " 
cost is $5 for cars or trucks, $10 for passenger vehicles such as vans or limousines, 
and $25 for a bus or troUey The drive is open Sunday through Thursday from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. 

' and Friday through Saturday from 6:00 to 10:00 p.m. 

3. Make someone's season memorable by taking them on a carriage ride around Head- 
waters Park. 

4. With the chaos of the semester subsided, one can acmalty pay anention to their nu- 
trition or fitness. Cook with an oven uistead of a microwave, and maybe think about getting 
into a gym routine to compensate for the physical inactivity of the last four months. 




5. If gyms carry negative connotations in your mind, embrace your inner child and play in the snow. A snowball fight can 
bum over 300 calories and building a snowman can bum over 250 calories for a 150 pound person, according to the Compen- 
dium of Physical Activities. If this season has little snow accumulation, go ice-skatingordosimple things at home like cleaning the house in preparadon for holiday 
guests. 

6. Ifexposingyourself 10 the elements ofwinter is not your idea ofa good time, seek rehige at the movie theatre. Ifyou're in the mood for a thriller Sweeney Todd 
is a good choice for those in the mood for a zany thriller or musical, Walk Hard for those in need of a laugh, and PS. I Love You for Chick-Flick 

7. Read a "cute" book that has litde or no literary merit, whether it is a horror narrative, a trashy romance novel, or an obscure topic that intrigues you. Refrain 
from psychoanalyzing the characters, considering any figurative language, or reflecting on its modern relevance, 

8. Bake cookies for Santa or build agingerbreadhouseor ifyou're feeling ambjtious.'a fortress. Simple recipes can be found at hltp://\vww.joyofbaking.com/ 
cookies.html. 

9. Hope the Writer's Strike ends so that you can watch new episodes of The Office, Heroes, Daily Snow, Colbert Report, Pushing Daisies, and your favorite late- 
night talk shows. In the meantime, play some Sudoku or Wii, which are much more stimulating and enhances your mind better than zoning out in front of a TV set. 

10. Sleep. 



Merry Christmas 

Damien Echols! 



By AARON THOMAS 

-moMAMOSeipfwedu 

This is a piece of news 
that thousands across 
the nation have been 
waiting and hoping to 
hear for nearly 14 years. 
The essential 
background 
information to preface 
this piece: 

In West Memphis, 
Arkansas in 1993, three 
eight-year-old boys 
were reported missing 
by their parents and 
a search took place 
immediately ^ It was 
not until the following 
afternoon that the 
bodies of Sieve Branch, 
Christopher Byers, and 
Michael Moore were 
found in Robin Hood 
Hills. They were hog- 
ticd and naked, and 
had suffered stabbing 
and extensive physical 
abuse. 

In the panic that 
followed within the next 
few weeks, a stressed 
and inexperienced 

police force hurried 



to find a suspect of 
some kind. At first, it 
looked like there were 
none. Eventually, police 
interrogated a teenager, 
Jessie Misskelly, who 
happened to know two 
other local teenagers 
who happened to dress 
differentiy from the 
majority of their peers, 
Damien Echols and 
Jason Baldwin.Misskelly 
was reported to have 
a 72 IQ score, which 
is borderline mental 
retardation. Four hours 
of interrogation passed 
(only 46 minutes of 
it recorded), and the 
police finally had their 
confession. 

The three teenagers 
were immediately 

arrested and would 
be put on trial for the 
rape and murder of the 
three boys, writh only 
Misskelly's inconsistent 
testimony to go on. 
Wlien they were put on 
trial, Misskelly was tried 
separately from the 
other two, even under 
promise of a reduced 



sentence, because he 
refused to testify' against 
them. In court, pieces 
of evidence against 
the teenagers brought 
in included black 
clothing, Stephen King 
novels, and Metallica 
song lyrics. The crime 
was labeled as being a 
Satanic ritual. The three 
were all found guilty; 
Echols was sentenced to 
death, havingabsolutely 
no physical evidence to 
link any of them to the 
crime. 

The original 
investigation and trial 
were presented in the 
documentary film 

Paradise Lost. The HBO 
broadcast of the film 
sparked thousands to 
learn more about the 
case and to Insist upon 
the teens' innocence, 
calling the arrest and 
trial a "witch hunt." 
Donations have been 
given by those people, 
which has funded 
the defense team to 
endlessly seek out 
evidence to prove their 



innocence. Among 
those who were 
outspoken about it 
include Eddie Vedder. 
Jack Black, Natalie 
Maines, and Henry 
Rollins who played an 
entire tour and recorded 
a benefit album for 
the purpose of raising 
money. Evidence was 
found in their favor, but 
multiple appeals were 
dented. 

Which brings us to the 
present day. On Oct, 30, 
2007, a writ of Habeas 
Corpus was filed, 
stating that it can now 
be proven by multiple 
DNA tests that none 
of the teens were there 
and that, in fact, one of 
the boy's stepfather may 
have been there. This is 
the very diing that so 
manyhave been waiting 
for, the first step on the 
road to their release. 
The West Memphis 
Three will never get 
their lime back, but 
they may get back their 
freedom that was taken 
so many years ago.

We circled each other. 

When space-time twisted, 

You bounced away. 

Tugged by a string that didn't touch me. 

You merged with the others. 

Entwined in their dance, 

Dependent on their pull. 

And gravely, 

I watched 

As I watch to this day. 

My brother from birth. 

Light-years away.

people are taking it on faith that the

Entertainment or Evil? 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

rmkjIOieiplw.eitu 

Aah, The Golden Compass. Yet an- 
other misguided aliempl for conserva- 
live groups to control what they can- 
nol; artistic freedom. For the life of me I 
cannot understand religious groups that 
can't stand a tittle questioning or. and 
forgive me if I step on some toes here, 
opposition. 

The roaring opposition in the print 
media, on Facebook and Internet blogs 
only brings more attention to the movie, 
which will be released into theaters this 
Friday. The groups that are opposing the 
release oFthis movie arc doing so under 
the assumptions ihal everyone who sees 
11 are a.) Christian and b.) are mindless, 



and not free thinking individuals. 

The one question I would like lo pose 
to the people/groups who oppose any 
type of religious questioning is this: Are 
your religious /spiritual beliefs so frag- 
ile that it can't stand to be questioned? 
It is the opinion many free thinkers 
that questioning anything only leads lo 
stronger beliefs down the road. 

And if a movie, made for sheer en- 
teriainmeni. like The Golden Compass 
(or even Harry Potter) is enough to turn 
a true Christian into an atheist, I have 
to wonder jusi how strong the religious 
foundation really is. Perhaps it's time lo 
slop attacking ariisiic freedom and take 
a good, hanj look al why these groups 
arc so damn scared.

^0 'More Mr. 'Wice Quv 



By AARON THOMAS 

thomamOB0ipfw.edu 

One of the most ludicrous things that 
has ever taken place in my lifetime nearly 
slipped by me unnoiiced. Thank God for 
ihe Internet. 

This year celebrates ■-■ 
the tenth anniversary 
of an album that was ig- 
nored, done by an artist 
thai the public moved 
on from years ago. He 
probably would've faded 

into complete obscurity — 

had it not been for the 

controversy surrounding him over half a 

century ago. 

The man's name is Pat Boone. The man 
who stole one of tlie most provocative 
songs of the 1950s (Utile Richard's "TUtti 
Prutli") and turned it into a safe-as-mllk, 
sock-hoppin' dance tune for white fami- 
lies in racially segregated communities. 
The man who blasted the Dixie Chicks 
because they don't "respect their elders." 



The man who, by his own estimate, re- 
corded nearly 40 gospel albums. Thai 
man, ten years ago, recorded a metal 
album. Well, more appropriately put, a 
"metal" album titled In A Metal Mood: No 
More Mr Nice Guy. The absurdit)' of the 
idea itself defies description. 

Boone, 

backed by 
1940's style 
big-band ja?^ 
musicians 
and various 
other artists, 
. belts his way 

through cover 
versions of metal classics such as Mc- 
tallica's "Enter Sandman," ludas Priest's 
"You've Got Another Thing Comin," even 
Led Zeppelin's "Stainvay To Heaven," 
amongothers.Maldngguest appearances 
on the album are none other than Ritchie 
Blackmore, who brings his Fender Stra- 
tocaster for "Smoke On the Water," and 
Ronnie lames Dio docs backing vocals 
on "Holy Diver." They are all presented 



"Boone appeared at the 

American Music Awards in his 

'metal' outfit, including a dog 

collar and nib-on tattoos." 



in classic Boone, family-friendly fashion. 
All naughty words removed. The album 
cover is even graced with a 63-year-old 
Boone shirtless except for a leather vest 
and a gold necklace, and even wearing an 
earring. I'll bet you didn't know that Pat 
Boone was street. 

It sounds so harmless and fun that no one 
could possibly find anything wrong with 
this, and might even encourage Boone to 
continue on this route of expansion (in a 
manner of speaking), reaching a whole 
new group of people who never would've 
given him the time of day, and simply 
ha\Nng a sense of humor about himself 
(in case you were wondering, Boone was 
in on the joke from the very beginning). 
Well, you'd be wrong to assume that. 
Aside from the album coveringsongs that 
were banned in many homes in their day, 
and Boone's oudandish look on the cover, 
he also appeared at the American Music 
Awards in his "metal" outlit, including a 
dog collar and rub-on tattoos. No kid- 
ding, rub-on tattoos and leather. 

His long-time gospel fans were out- 
raged at his behavior. Due to the number 
of complainis, he was immediately fired 



from his gospel radio program on the 
Trinity Broadcasting Network. He went 
on the Christian broadcasting circuit try- 
ing to defend his actions that struck so 
many as being unforgivably offensive. He 
insisted to all of his attackers that what 
he had done was a joke and that they 
should not take it so seriously. When he 
said that tlicy were all really good songs 
in their essence, one writer responded, 
"Good songs? Any believer with even a 
small amount of spiritual discernment 
would identify them as evil and filthy!" 
"Tlitli Frutti" is a song about sex, if ever 
there was one. "Crazy Thiin" is a political 
protest anthem. Yet, the latter is the "evil" 
song. 

For all of those out there who were 
worried there for a moment, don't sweat 
it. Pat Boone is still a busy litde beaver, 
writing articles in favor of the ultra-con- 
servative, running his label, recording 
(originals and covers), and trying to gel 
himself into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. 
In spite of all of that, we do at least still 
have a funny picture to took at on a jewel 
case cover and twelve songs to laugh at 
for many more decades to come.

and played with a lot of 
energ&gt;' and were verj' ag- 
gressive." said Chris Paul 
on the first half. "We shot 
the ball relatively well 
and lohnna Lewis-Carl- 
isle carried us in the first 
half. We were In a good 
position for the second 
half. 1 was pleased."

scoring 20 points lo Wis- 
consin's 7 over the next 
nine minutes. The Bad- 
gers would finish with a 
16 point lead for the win, 
85-69. 

"The first four minutes 
of the second half hurt us. 
We were down by eight, 
had the ball, turned it 
over and the next thing 
you know we go from 
eight to fifteen down. 
Vou can't do that against 
a good basketball learn 
like Wisconsin. From that 
point on to the end we 
played them even. 1 was 
proud that we continued 
to scrap and we did some 
good things. Wisconsin is 
a team that will battle in 
the lop half of the Big Ten 
and it was a good learn- 
ing experience."

From Page 3 

opinion on principle — 
when doing so will likely 
result in their defeat — 
seems like a passive-ag- 
gressive way of claiming 
the whole political sys- 
tem doesn't work. Strong- 
ly worded open letters 
aren't going to keep the 
religious right from vot- 
ing their conscience. 

Why not appeal by us- 
ing the menace of those 
scary Jesus people as a 
lever to get the iPod/teKt- 
message generation to 
register? Seems odd. 

The trouble is that 
youthful apathy toward 
the election process is 
such an old story tliat tlie 
college-aged see it more 
as a permanent reality 
than a disturbing trend. 
This is also why univer- 
sity editorial pages show 
so much sympathy for 
outright radical protest 
types who aim to un- 
dermine procedural de- 
mocracy far more than 
the prayer-in-school 
people ever have. And it's 
also why these colum- 
nists continue to ivrite 
in their college newspa- 
pers about Giuliani's lisp, 
Obama's inhalation and 
Hillary's cleavage -baring 
blouse. 

To begin acknowledging 
the issues would be the 
beginning of the end — 



an end Uiai for the gen- 
eration raised under the 
George W. Bush adminis- 
tration seems a foregone 
conclusion. If you start 
lining up the candidates 
between liberal and con- 
servative poles, then take 
an educated guess about 
where the pulse of the 
mythical Average Ameri- 
can is these days, then 
from a lot of these ^vrit- 
ers' perspectives you've 
just spoiled the whole 
ending, which is sup- 
posed to be a year away 
still. If you consider the 
2003-'04 primary pro- 
cess, which saw a lot of 
politicans \vith youthful 
appeal gel ground into 
dust by machine candi- 
dates, you can see why 
they are leery. 

The trouble with this 
thinking is that college 
smdents, as much as they 
might like to imagine 
othenvise, aren't a closed 
system apart from the 
rest of the nation. These 
18-to-24-year-old voters 
need to try to work within 
the system, because it's 
going to be many years 
yet before they are in any 
position to make sweep- 
ing changes.
