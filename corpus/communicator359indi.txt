; ing things ject hits to home. In the spint of 

' such as Kalloween. we are going to share one 

icrs and Ihc like, of our roncems and fears with all of 

reepy eharaelcu you. 




One of IPFW's biggest problems 
has been a lack of funding. It ieeiru 
that this university always has to Hghl 
for mole. For thiee years in a row the 
Alumni Association has been sponsor- 
ing the Legislative ksucs Luncheon. 
The purpose of this luncheon is lo 
inforni siudenls and legislators about 
issues concerning IPFW. Another 
imponani aspect is letting students 
know that Iheir voices aie very power- 
ful. Students need to contact iheir leg- 
islators in Older to help change things 
on this campus. 

What kind of education are we 
getung if we arc always at ihe bottom 
rung? This univeisity is always play- 
up. Protessois lake positions

From last spring lo the upcoming 
spring semester, there have been no 
500 level courses offered in communi- 
cation. Some courses have been avail- 
able during the summer sessions. 
However, many people are not avail- 
able m take classes in Ihe summer. 
How are sludenls supposed to gradu- 
ate if required classes aren't offered 
dunng the regular semester? These are 
basic needs of students. What's going 
on here? There are many good aspects 
about this campus but when are faced 
with these situations, we arc inclined 
lo wander about the quality of the 
education and guidance IPFW is sup- 
posed to be providing for us. 

We are only a few students out 
of many. Who knows what kinds of 
problems many of you have had. It 
isn't fair that a lol of the money that 
could go to our university Is pui into 
the main campuses. Ihudue and lU. 
We menlioned earlier that ihe voice of 
the sludenls is a powerful weapon. 

One of Ihe best ways in which 
we can improve our education is to 
talk with our local legislators. They 
want to know what kinds of problems 
students have when Iheir university is 
CKlremely underfunded. 

We're talking about our futures 
here. ^Vhal kind of jobs are we going 
lo be qualified for ifwe aren't provid- 
ed with the right tools or ihc right 
training? Tliink about it.

Throw in the fact that there are so 
many terrible drivers in Foil Wayne 
and sending people back for more 
education is a dead idea. 

There are other things that can be 
done, though. Traffic lights could be 
paused lo allow pedcstnans safe cross- 
ing over both parts of Ihe intetsection. 
Walkways could be buill over the 
busier inlerseclions lo provide betler

Suddenly you have stomach pains and you have to go

do, you might be suffcnng from a common condition 
known as Imlabte Bowel Syndrome (IBS). 

Although it is not clear what causes IBS, it Is rcc- 
ogniied as an intestinal disorder whose symptoms 
increase with stress. Elizabeth Marlow writes in 
Lippincotl's Primary Practice Journal that 20 percent of

People who suffer from IBS oflen eipericnce

tender or painful abdomen, nausea, decrejMed appetite 
and sometimes vomiting They may also feel tired. 
Miriow states that over half of the people with IBS suf- 
fer from dianhca. Stools can become very mucousy and 
watery, "Scir-Repon and Polysomnographic Measures 
of Sleep in Women with IBS." a Nursing Research aro- 
clc, [eporis that many female IBS sufferers have prob- 
lems sleeping. Il is not clear whether the symptoms 
cause a decrease in ability to sleep or if difficulty sleep- 
ing is an additional pnmaiy symptom of IBS. 

What can you do if you think you have IBS? First,

If your doctor diagnoses you with IBS, you can

fcofithlclcsatlPFW.you 
probably think that most players come from 
Fort Wayne and ihe surrounding cities. You 
might not realize how geographically diverse 
our athletic piogranu ore. Many athletes come 
from dinercnl stales and some even come 
from different countries. 

Ian Luya, starting midfielder for the 
men's soccer team is one such player. 1 was 
able Id speak with Luya during the relum trip 
from a recent soccer game in Keniucky 
Unfonunalely, both the men's and women's 
learns lost their games againsi Noiihern 
Keniucky. The men"s lost game was against 
Saginaw Valley on Ocl. 24. Luya plays an 
impoilant rote on the men's team. He is an 
aggressive, skilled and supportive player. His 
voice con be heard during play, calling for the 
ball and encouraging his teammates. 

Luya was bom in Grefller Ivlanchcsler. 
England and has played soccer for IS years. 
Luya has friends in Warsaw, Ind, They invited 
him lo come and look al some of the schools 
in ihisarw in February of 1999. Luya chose to 
play 31 IPFW and said. "I came lo IPFW in Ihe 
fall of 1999 because I wanted lo play soccer al 
a high standard, as well as cnniinuc my aca- 
demic studies,' Luya saw an opportunity lo 
come to the United Stales and piny soccer 
inslcad of playing in England. 'I did this 
because university sport is nol well organized 
in England and tends lo be intramural, which 
I did nnt wanl." said Luya. 

1 asked Luya lo comment on his feelings 
abi&gt;ul IPFW going Division ! and he said, "I 
think that in the long run, becoming a 



go Divi 



this in all spoils with the seasons being pietty 
.' Since the decision was made to 
n L the soccer team is unable lo 
die Great Lakes Valley Conference 

Tournament and the NCAA Toumamenl for 

After speaking with Luya, it is apparent 
that the team has had a positive season. They 
may have been inconsislenl al times, but Ihcy 
have won some very imporlanl games. Luya 
said. 'My feelings ore that there have been 
more positives than negatives to the season,' 
The team knew all along that no matter how 
well ihey did, ihcy would nol be able to 
advance to the NCAA Toumamenl, The fuiurc 
looks bright for the men's soccer team. 
Division t may bring bigger success for the 
men's icam by adding belter players and rais- 
ing ihe standard for play. 

Since Luya's mother still lives in 
England, he communicalcs wilh her via use of 
the Inlemel. He speaks wilh her about once a 
week and it works out better for tjolh of ihcm
