grant from the Partnership of 
Public Service and National

The Times report "Where

view of government projections 
for hiring need across agencies. 
Fifteen departmental cabinets 
and nine agencies, representing 
95 percent of all federal jobs, 
were surveyed by The Times. 

One goal of this report is 
to show students and odicr job 
seekers the large number of 
jobs in their expertise, and how 
to find and obtain these jobs. 

The vocation with the 
largest expected Increase of hir- 
ing for the next two years is the 
Security sector, which will push 
for 37,515 hires. The category 
of security includes inspec- 
tors, investigators, compliance 
officers, police officers, secu-

Nahrwald was able to

some issues facing the public 
school system. She also had a 
chance to speak briefly with the

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES - With celebra- 
tions for the Lunar New Year well under 
way, many .Asian cultures are practicing 
their traditions to usher in good luck for the 
upcoming year. 

Lunar New Year is traditionally a cel- 
ebration that is meant to be spent with 
family. But since many students are not 
able to go home for the holiday, various cul- 
tural groups on campus have been hosting 



i he formalities, when with the families .

Armhawan Darsono, president of the Chi- 
nese Students Association at the University 
of California at Los Angeles. 

One of the events was the Chinese 
New Year Hotpot organized by the Chinese 
Students Association and the Dashew In- 
ternational Center, 

Since food traditions are critically 
important and symbolic in celebrating the 
new year, they have been made an impor- 
tant part of celebrations at UCLA as well. 

For Chinese New Year, a large dinner 
is prepared for the family. Traditionally, 
sweet dumplings are a pan of the meal. 

The round shape of the dumplings 
symbolizes the family being together. Sweet 
rice cakes and fish are also included in the 
new year's meal, said Puiki Hong, a first- 
year pre-business economics student. At 
the end of the meal, there is supposed to be 
food left over so that there will be leftovers 
for the next year, said Remington Ong, a 
third-year electrical engineering student. 

Ong said that traditionally a rice ball 
is taken to a statue of the god of fortune 
- usually found in every home - and is 
placed on its mouth so that it will bless the 
l.imilv tor the year.

cultures with varying customs

Public schools shouldn't teach creationist theories 



At the end of last month, the school 
superintendent of the state of Georgia 
proposed removing the word "evolution" 
from the state's science curriculum and 
replacing it with the phrase, "biological 
changes over time." The evolution de- 
bate has sparked so much interest that 
it was profiled in a recent issue of News- 
week. 

It is obvious that the mere word 
"evolution" (and its counterpart, "cre- 
ationism" for that matter) sparks a 
strong emotion in people that feel 
strongly about the issue. The feeling is 
so strong, in fact, that discussion of the 
topic is almost impossible. Instead, the 
topic has to be watered down before it 
can even be discussed amongst com- 



munity members for fear of raising too 
many emotions. 

Kansas has been facing the same 
problem concerning "evolution" for 
years. Five years ago, people rallied to 
change the word "evolution" in order 
to downplay the theory. Three years 
ago, it was changed back to "evolution." 
Now, community members are trying to 
change it again. This time, however, the 
theory of intelligent design is prevalent 
on their minds instead of creationism. 

The two are very similar, except that 
creationism is more Christian-based 
than intelligent design, which is still 
faith-based. 

The fight over the world "evolution" 
represents a political struggle that has 



nothing to do with education, and more 
to do with a political struggle between 
the empirically based scientific theories, 
and the unchanging, faith-based belief 
systems such as Intelligent Design and 
Creationism. 

Because public schools are funded 
by public money, the taxpayers (and par- 
ents of students) have the right to have a 
say in the school's curriculum. But can a 
community actually remove a scientific 
theory from the educational system and 
supplant faith-based teaching in a pub- 
lic institution? 

The upcoming court battles will not 
answer this question nor decide the end 
of the evolutionary debate; it will only 
add fuel for this perpetual debate.

isn't there? So soon after Tom 
Daschle's defeat and the Brad 
and len split, I don't know how 
much more my heart can take, 
so please let me believe we still 
have basketball. 

In one of my childhood

a date. It goes something

During thai season, the basket- 
ball spirit swept me up and has 
yet to put me back down. 

I've since progressed in 
my basketball fanship, and 
while high school basketball 
remains special to me in the 
way that my very first boyfriend 
does, my heart now belongs to 
college ball. For one thing, I 
can enjoy it from the comfort 
of my own living room where 
unsuspecting fellow game-go- 
ers are not forced to witness my 
unique brand of cheering — nor 
am I forced to witness anyone 
else's. 1 don't like booing. I 
don't distinguish between boo- 
ing the opponent and booing 
the game itself. Don't even get 
me started on booing players

Fueled by the

ence remains one of the most 
excitingofmylife. The Big Red 
Basketball Band's energy filled 
the entire arena. I can't recall 
any Ohio State fans, although 



solidified my loyalty, renewed 
my faith and made me feel like

park. Seeing the real temples requires that 
you find yourself some transportation, a 
map and, hopefully, a guide. 

Most of the temples in Korea are on, 
near or behind mountains. Some of the 
most beautiful I've seen have required me 
to struggle through a few hours of climb- 
ing (there and back again). But the first 
temple I went to only required that I hail 



more like a scene from a loose-with-the- 
details Vietnam War buddy movie. 

Houses are something you rarely 
see in Korea — most people live in apart- 
ments — but there were plenty of houses 
near the temple. The houses were small 
and generally made of brick. Many had 
tin roofing, and most had fences made of 
whatever happened to be lying around. 
Every house seemed to have a sandy gar- 
den, a dog and kids playing. 

Oddly, I think most people have this 
image of Korea in their minds: tiny ram- 
shackle houses tucked away in the moun- 
tains. But in reality, this little scene is (he 
exception and not the rule. 

The taxi pulled us right into the 
temple gates. The beautifully ornate and 
brightly colored temple was in stark con- 
trast to its surroundings. The main struc- 
ture was huge — three very large stones — 
and the whole building was adorned with 
what I thought were swastikas. 

This is something that took a little 
getting used to: in Korea, the crooked cross 
that we think of as a swastika is a Buddhist 
symbol that adorns temples and shops

The cards, I was later told, had the 
names of ever person who had stayed at 
the temple in the last year. 

That day, I had actually come to 
the temple for a service. Many temples 
have services in which monks chat about 
various topics, and this particular tem- 
ple sponsored English language services 
(which have, unfortunately, stopped). 

While the early* pan of the service 
involved a lot of chanting and bowing, 
most of the service was just listening to 
the monk chat. It was very relaxed, very 
peaceful and very open. 

"Does anyone have any questions?" 
the monk asked at the end of her chat and 
smiled. The openness was in stark contrast 
to my Catholic roots. Even though I was 1

Science finds 
genetic link 
to origin of 
love 

By Jenell Jackson

talis the "love theory." 

Grzegorz Rdzak, a 6th-se- 

incster chemistry major from Po- 
land, said lie began forming his 
"love theory'' alter trips to several 
different dance dubs. Itd/ak said 
he noticed thai all the girls he was

with girls In- found attractive to

though be is quick to add that he 
was not a "player." 

"After the first girl. It was

From here, Rdzak said he

According to Rdzak, this 

might explain why we are attracted 
to certain people. It might also ac- 
count fur the so-called 'love at first

According to Rd/ak's dieuiy, 
a person's taste for another per- 
son would depend on then genetic 
match for each other. Ibis match, 
Rdzak said, does not necessar-

Although some scientists 
think introns are "nonsense" DNA,

agrees. 

"I think that our body would 
not waste any energy to produce

Rdzak said he believes these 
introns are the key to why humans 
fall in love. 

Rdzak said the theory also 
goes far to provide consolation 
lor a recent breakup. His relation- 
ship, which he said ended after 
an unsuccessful attempt at long- 
distance love, can be explained 
through bis love theory.

Quintin Carouthers: evolution in the game 



IPFW sophomore guard 
Quintin Carouthers was 
introduced to the game 
at age eight, and hasn't 
looked back since.

Things just keep getting better for a kid by the 
name of Quintin Carouthers. 

A sophomore on the men's basketball team, 
Carouthers has slowly taken a leading role in the 
Mastodons quest for Division I status. But for this 
guard, his personal mission for basketball great- 
ness began long ago. 

Carouthers grew up in Flint, Michigan, raised 
by his parents Ralph and Corinthian. As a youth, 



he participated in many sports, I

"When 1 finally got a chance to go o 



ndplay 
with other people it exposed me and kind of put 
me ahead of a lot of people," said Carouthers of 
when he first learned about his chances of using 
basketball to better his life. 

Flint Central High School was the setting for 
Carouthers's prep career. It was during this time 
that he was considered one of the best shoot- 
ing guards in all of Michigan. During his senior 
season, Carouthers led his team to the city cham- 
pionship behind 13.5 points per game. Among 
the honors Carouthers earned in high school 
was being nominated for the McDonald's All 
American game. 



"What he brings to the table athletically, mosl 
teams on our schedule don't have," noted IPFW 
interim head coach Pechota. 

Out of high m l.iir.l. in.iii'. high j n tl mid-major 
colleges, including several MAC schools, looked 
at Carouthers. Larry DeSimpelare, an assistant 
coach at Ringers University, introduced him to

Pechota's former college coach, DeSimpelare, 
then called his former player to tell him about 
Carouthers. After DeSimpelare talked to 
Carouthers about the Mastodon program, the 
Michigan All-Star made his decision to attend 

"I hadn't heard of IPFW but then I got hooked 
up with IP (Joe Pechota) and (former head) coach 
(Doug) Noll at the time," noted Carouthers. "I

more Hilary O'Connell was just behind 
Martin against IUPUI with 14, and smoked 
sue long-range shots against the Panthers 
last Thursday to lead the team to victory. 
O'Connell put up 24 points in the contest, 
and was the teams leading scorer as well. 

Juniors Geneva Murdock, Kelly Boyd

the hardest working individuals in IPFW 
athletics right now. Boyd is fifth on the

community, and hopes were aimed at the 

However, the Mastodons fell from 
grace after such a promising start. They 
have gone 3-18 since game three, and 
have basically fought through hell in the 
process. They have played tough teams 
like Notre Dame, Marquette, Air Force and 
Xiivier. Lnoughsaid. 

David Simon's senior season was 
pumped and hyped up after last year's re- 
markable display (18 points per game, 9.8 
rebounds). Honestly, this year is going well 
for the big man (16.5 points per game, 6.6 
rebounds). 

So the numbers are a little lower, tell 
that to a guy that rehabilitated his knee in- 
jury in half a year. Simon also leads the In- 
dependents (and most teams IPFW plays) 
in scoring from the center position. Simon 
shoved 27 points down the Bears' throats 
in the contest last Thursday. 

Junior transfer Quintin Butler has av- 
eraged 7.4 points since coming here from 
Wabash Valley. He is second to Simon (13 1) 
on the rebound list with 1 14. South Caro-

Panel explores enigma of creative process 



(U-WIRE) BLOOM1NGTON, Ind. - The question might have evaded 
the two musicians, two writers and a visual artist had they not been 
sitting side by side comparing mediums. Instead, the strangers came 
together to dispel an enigma - the enigma of the creative process. 

Several of the out-of-town artists came in part because they 
were artistically connected

Margaret Dolinsky, an 1U faculty member and visual artist, 
now works closely with computer programmers to create visual 
reality art. She described her work as very colorful, a cross between 
modem and primitive. 

"Support as a word has real- 
ly changed a lot for me," Dolinsky 
said. "Before it was from other

Michael Wilkerson, coordinator of ArtsWeek. "So it seemed natural tc 
have a panel on the creative process." 

The panel cut across the disciplines of music, writing and visu- 
al art, and the members sat at a long table with three microphones 
perched in the John Waldron Arts Center. About 25 people turned out 
to hear them speak. 

Colin Teevan, translator of "Bacchai," which finished its run 
in the Wells-Metz Theatre last Saturday, said Greek plays lend them- 
selves well to constant re interpretation. He said the decision to 
clothe the Bacchai characters in anime-style dress had nothing to do 
with him, it was a directorial decision. In the original 2002 London 
performance, the characters wore burqas. 

"Usually to me, there's a key starting point," Teevan said about 
the creative process. "I see it as connection ... you see two apparently 
(disconnected) things and you see the connection." 

Teevan has also rewritten "The niiad" to be the story of the 
coach of the Irish team quitting in the wake of the World Cup. 

"I don't like issue-based theater." he said "1 think the (role) of 
theater is to present an argument. I think it's a (dialogue) between

"It's very hard to discover 
talent in a purely commercial 
world," he said. "That starts the 
marketing and you work back- 
wards to the play." 

Most of the artists talked 
about the places they found 
inspiration. For Susan Swaney, 



She said she takes down snatches 
of conversations, and descriptions 
of the people around her.

Marsha Estell, playwright of "HEAT." which is playing at the 
Bloomington Playwrights Project through Feb. 26, said the idea for 
"HEAT" came to her on the hottest day of that year in her Chicago 



She said "HEAT" is a play about healing, and the 
women have with each other, especially those in the same family. 
She said it was a simple story, with a lot of levels. 

"This was the easiest play I've ever written." she said. "Because 
it just unfolded before me ... It was like magic." 

Susie Ibarra, percussionist of the Susie Ibarra Ensemble, com- 
poses jazz and has been collaborating with Pulitzer Prize-winning 
poetYusef Komunyakaa since 1998, who was not present at the talk- 
She said often Komunyakaa would fax her the poems, and then 
she would compose to them. 

All the artists put emphasis on the community aspect of creat-

must work to return to that state. 
Dolinsky said she called 
this process "flow," after a book 
of that same name by Mihaly 
Csikszentmihalyi.

of flow, but we don't know how to
