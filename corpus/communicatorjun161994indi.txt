to promote and enhance commu-

After realizing the necessity of 
a women's association to promote

Lucille Johnson Perkins, one of 
the founders of EWI, felt that the 
organization would not only be 

those involved. 

In 1939, the first EWI chapter 
(formerly named Executives' 
Secretaries. Inc.) was chortered 



in Los Angeles. 

Currently, EWI has over 4,000 
firms with memberships in 91 
chapters across the country. 

Any students interested in 
applying for the scholarship, can 
do so at the following locations 
IPFW, Walb Union, Room 113; 
YWCA, 2000 North Wells, and 
the Fort Wayne Women's Bureau, 
303 E. Washington. 

All applications will be 
accepted through July 15.

More grants available 
for female students 



By JoAnnStclnforth 
News Editor 

Judith M. Clinton, executive 
director of IPFW University 
Relations, was recently honored 
with the Eleanor Roosevelt Award 
by the Fort Wayne chapter of the 
American Association of 
University Women (AAUW). 

SI, 000 was contributed in 
Clinton's name to the Eleanor 
Roosevelt Fund for Women and 
Girls by the national AAUW 
Educational Foundation. 

"I am interested in people learn- 
ing about the availability of these 
scholarships," said Clinton and 
added, "this is very satisfying, 1 
believe in what the foundation is 
doing. 

Clinton is on the national selec- 
tion committee for the AAUW and 
said that she encourages everyone 
to apply for one of these grants. 

The opportunity for women 
seeking grants is increasing, 
according to Clinton. 

One grant available to women 
is the Community Action Grant. 
According to an AAUW annual 
report, this fellowship enables 
AAUW groups and individual 
women to offer up to S5.000 grants 
(that promote education and equity 
for women and girls). 
Applications for the Community 
Action Grant haw increased more 
than 20 percent over the past few 
years. 

Career Development Grants 



assist women by contributing up to 
$5,000 toward earning with bache- 
lor's degrees up to $5,000. who are 
re-cntenng the work force, chang- 
ing careers, or advancing existing 
careers. Applicants for this grant 
have increased 34 percent over 
recent years. 

Selected Professions 

Fellowships support women during 
their final year of graduate study in 
fields where female participation is 
traditionally low. 

Traditionally, white women 
have increased their ranks three- 
fold since 1970 in the educational 
areas of law, business, architec- 
ture, and medical, while women of 
color had not been fully represent- 
ed. This is changing however, 
today approximately 47 percent of 
all Selected Professions 
Fellowships go to women of color. 

The Eleanor Roosevelt Teacher 
Fellowships help women public 
school teachers (grades K-12) take 
courses to improve their instruc- 
tion of girls. 

The Eleanor Roosevelt 
Research Fund commissions target 
public policy research to improve 
the education of girls from early 
childhood through grade 12.

The teachers, with excitement in 
their voices, informed the class of all 
the places we would visit. We formed 
up into groups. I bad a boy and a girl,

The bus hadn't even stalled yet, and I

Once we gol started, the mood 
became rather festive for the event. It

get a prairie dog out of a bird. Luckily, 
the real prairie dog showed up from one 
of the holes in the mound. A sigh of 
relief came from the man and he said, 
"Now thai looks more like a dog." 

We all went 10 tbe exploration 
building to see the spiders, snakes, and 
all sorts of hands-on exhibits. By mix- 
ing animal parts, the kids showed how 
truly creative they could be, like by 
pulling the bead of a pam&gt;l on a giraffe 
My son made a perfect ostrich, which is 
no surprise (He's told me thai he wants 
to be a math teacher.) 

As we passed by the lake, Ihe 
whole troop spied the alligators sunning 
themselves. Tbe girl in my group 
thought they were sleeping, so she start-

instant, I could hear the headlines on 
the evening news, "Alligator wakes up 
and gels upper hand." Luckily, I was 
able to detour everyone to the, African

the alligators.

Coming Out 

True friends respect differences 



One of Ibc biggest fears everyone 
has when dealing with their homosexu- 
ality is tbe chance of losing friends 
because they happen lo disagree with 
homosexuality. The high school years 
arc filled with fag jokes. Who would 
openly put themselves into the position 
of being the butt of these put-downs? 
So it seems much easier to hide your 
homosexuality than defend it. 

Soon, your life is lived lo please 
your friends. Vou dale members of the 
opposite sex. You are now leading two 
lives, neither of which is a happy one 

There is only one solution to soch a 
dilemma: the best thing to do is to come 

If someone is comfortable with his 
or her sexuality, coming out can be 
done quickly and entirely. But for most 



others, a gradual approach is suggested. 

Start with someone who knows you 
well. Sit them down and just say it. 
"I'm gay!" You may find out that the 
people who arc closest lo you have 
already suspected it. Answer any ques- 
tions they may have. Talking about it 
will make it easier each time. 

Let's say you tell someone about 
your homosexuality and he or she 
doesn't respond favorably. What then? 
My advice is to move on. The people 
who do not accept you do not really 
love you, I don't need them; do you? 
Being gay is such an important aspect 
in life that you don't need people 
around you bringing you down for 
something you didn't decide and cannot 
control. 

Hopefully, one of two things will 
happen: 1 ) You will come out lo some- 
one who will love you unconditionally; 
or, 2) You will come ou 



who normally is against homosexuality 
but loves you enough to accept you. It 
is the latter. That may change people's 
perceptions about gays. You arc show- 
ing them that gays ore not freaks, per- 
verts, or child molesters, but people. 

Personally, I come out to every new 
person I meet. I want these people lo 
really know who I am, no surprises. 1 
don't understand why anyone would 
want to risk hurting their own feelings. 
Why get emotionally attached lo some- 
one only lo lose them because they ore 
homophobic and prejudiced? 1 find a lot 
of pride in being a homosexual, and I 
don't want someone who cannot handle 
my sexual orientation lo tarnish thai 

The bottom line is, no one likes 
being lied to... especially by friends. So 
don't tic to yours. Being true to them is 
as important as being true lo yourself.

Diversity enrichs educational experience

Diversity is an essential component 
of Ihe liberal education that is our goal 
at IPFW. One of the things that we 
expect from someone who has earned a 
college degree, whatever Ihe field, is 
the recognition that we arc not all the 
same-thai different cultures, different 
races, diffei 



n human institutions over the women, gays and lesbians, and olhcr 
centuries. Similarly, but taking hitherto in adequate I y represented

Chancellor-designate speaks out on diversity 



By Michael Wartell 
Chancellor-designate 

The editor of The Communicator 
has invited me to outline briefly my 
views regarding diversity at IPFW. I 
wdl speak to the matter more fully once 
fall semester begins, but I welcome this 
opportunity lo share some of my pre- 
liminary thoughts. 

If we measure diversity only by the 
number of women and people from dif- 
ferent ethnic backgrounds who work 
and study here, we might conclude that 
reasonable progress has been made in 
recent years. The growing number of 
women and minorities shows we are 
moving in the right direction. But our 
past gains must continue and. where 
possible, at an increased pace. And fur- 




ther, we must move fully to embrace Ihe 
idea that diversity at a university needs 
to be understood not only in terms of 
numbers but also in the large context of 
ideas. Universities are society's haven 
for ideas and their communication, and 
tbe conception and open discussion of 
ideas can happen only when a tolerant 
environment exists among and for peo- 
ple of different races, ethnic back- 
grounds, genders, religions, physical 
challenges, and sexual preferences. 
New ideas, distinct approaches lo prob- 
lem solving, and contrasting opinions 
similarly must be welcomed and 
respected- Thus diversity ol IPFW. as at 
any university, must encompass both 
physical and intellectual dimensions.

'Garden' tells story 
of real life people 



i .lumnht and prevloui 

editor of New York magiaine John 
Berrnilt has written a hen-telling mur- 
der life entitled "Midnighl In the 
Girden "f Good and Evil" (Rindom 
Houic. $Z3), which it quickly gaining 
a cimom tort of cult itatus among iu

Trouble ii. the characters actually 
exlll .iii.l. at IcjM in the caie of thit 
particular literary oddity, it provet 
(nith can be COlmically stranger than 
fiction. Take as an example the beauti- 
ful Lady Chablii, drag queen extraor- 
dinaire ii the now infomoui Club One 
in downtown Savannah, Georgia. 

"1 told John thai as he goet up the 
ladder of success I'm on the step right 
behind him and thai ain't easy, Honey, 
with these heels on," she was quoted 
u saying in USA Today. 

Besides Club One, Donavenlure 
Cemetery and Mercer House, home of 
the main character, Jim Williams, 
ucm lo be the holiest spots. One anec- 
dote in the book describes how 
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis once 
slopped by Mercer House and offered 
to buy the building and contents for 3 
million dollan. When Williams in the 
book is asked how it feels to be nou- 
veau riclie. he responds by suying that 
it's ihcrichclhal counts. 

Savannah seems lo be a partic- 
ular breeding ground for Southern 
eccentricities of all fruit and fla- 
vor. What makes lhat so peculiar 
is ihcir enjoyment of Ihe acclaim.

plot lo keep things spicy. Coupled 
with ihe traditional societal peculiari- 
ties of a fairly isolated old Southern 
city with more history than Ihe 
promised land, il makes for a deviant- 
ly good time. What really makes Ihe 
story fly is the fact that Ihe past is 
never really gone Time seems to sit 
on its haunches. All the dead seem to 
he wbal the true heritage of the old 
city is all about. Eerily enough, the 
dead seem to pay homage to the living 
in turn There's an anecdote for every 
name ever heard. Berendt uses pseu- 
donyms for some of the characters in 
the tale so il has become sort of a 
gome in Savannah's 'society rings' to 
('ii.- nit out who's who. Not every citi- 
zen -turned -character is likely to be 
happy with Bercndl though. 

While describing how cheap 
Savannah bluchloods can actually be, 
be tells the story of how one matron 
ordered a set of wrought iron gates for 
her home. When they finally arrived 
she refused to pay for them. When 
they were brought lo salvage, howev-

it . in for a fraction of the original cost, 
Bcrcndt's work has been called "a 
slice of sleaze that's very cruel to peo- 
ple" with enough truth to actually hurt 
people. Apparently, sleaze sells. 
Movie rights to the work have been 
sold and everyone is guessing on 
who's playing who. "1 don't sec bow

A Dose of Douse 

African- Americans need to develop self-program 



As a 21-year-old African- Amcr it m 
male. 1 look at the world around me and 
continue lo wonder if any of the miJ- 
ness out there will eventually slop I 
find mytelf doing so much self-evalua- 
tion and wondering if it is me And 1 
know it's not me It's the fad thai so 
many people have not chosen i&lt;&gt; uie 
their own minds, bot allow things such 
as Ihe media to control wbal they 
believe and how they sec things lo 
other words, the television, the newspa- 
pers, and the radio have taken ihe place 
of books, teachers, professors, and just 
plain thinking. People are programmed. 
It really scares me because I don't have 
the slightest idea who the programmer 

For instance, Ihe other day I was 
watching Rikki Lake and found myself 
very angry with not only her but also 
with the African- American people that 
were on ihe show. 

The show's topic was "I let my hus- 
band have an affair because I'm preg- 

Now, my first reaction was what 
kind of crap is Ihis to be on television, 
but then again I am looking at a talk 
show. Wbal blew me away the most 
was the fact that these women who 
were on the show had no problem with 
their men "getting theirs" in spite of 
their pregnancies, Yet these women fail 
lo realize thut the percentage of 
African -Americans contracting AIDS 
continues to increase because Africun- 
Amcricons that arc gay and straight are 
nol practicing safe sex and ore sharing 
drug needles. They continue to walk 
around in denial or just don't care But. 
he's still got "to gel his." 



Nol ool) this, ihe -.. 
dctity continues lo reinforce the ttereo- 

incapjble of mail

I find mj 'ell thinking one of the

Once again I am left wondering why 
tlin pessimistic person is considered a 
■ ommunit) k-ader when the only thing 
hi) comments on the radio do is contin- 
ue to promote helplessness, bopeless- 
nc and apathy. 



"1 find myself thinking one of the only reasons why 
these people are on television is because they want 
to be on television like the stars. Yet they fail to 
realize that they are being exploited by the 'pro- 
grammers.' But that's okay because he 'got his."* 



realize lhat Ibey are being exploited by 
Ihe "programmers ," Dm that's okay 
because he "got his." 

Then I listen to radio each morn- 
ing I would like to make a point of 
saying that 1 du listen to FOXY 
because il is a Black radio nation. 
FOXY has thiv forum in the nioin- 
ing in which the hosl di!

thinking lo myself, so he mastered 



Once again. I think these people for- 
get that before Martin Luther King, Jr. 
there were the enslaved African people 
who ingeniously created "hush har- 
bors." For those of you who don't 
know, hush harbors were lime periods 
crealcd by enslaved people of color 
who met lo educate themselves and 
plan revolutions or escapes while 
Master was asleep. Unfortunately, some 
African -Americans have become use- 
less shells of the people lhat we once 

Why? 



Because tome African-Americans 
have allowed Ihe program men lo 
manipulate Ihcir mind* by tiling Ihe 
vehicles of individualism, materialism, 
and Christianity lo tlrip them ot their 
spirituality which gave Ihem the 
ttrenglh and determination lo nnvivt in 
the first place- 
So, what's Ihe solution? 
Well, I really don't think that one 
person such as mytelf can develop solu- 
tions lo Ihis problem because it is going 
to lake a collective effort to eliminate 
our current path of self-genocide and 
hatred. 

However, one solution can be divid- 
ed into two ports: first, we must begin 
to train and educate the young African- 
Americans thai have some knowledge 
of self into becoming leaders so our 
people arc not in a itatc of emergency. 

The other step is lo listen lo 
what young adults such as myself 
or other African-Americans like me 
have lo say. Put us into the leader- 
ship positions because the old lead- 
ers are no longer clfcctivc. Some of 
them hove become obsolete; others 
have sold their souls to material- 
ism; others just want to live off

You didn't hear it from me, but... 




F. Lane Douse, Activities Editor 



You didn't hear tc from me, but I 
think th« some people In the United 
5tJMi really need to stop and re- 
evaluate their belief e-yoteme and 
ouch. I recently picked up a eopy of 
the paper and oaw that an animal 
right* group I* going to cue a couple 
for cruelty to animals. This couple, 
ntio also o»n a restaurant, appeared 
on the "Today Show" and prepared 
some type of dish that involved frying 



Well. I guess the animal rights 
group saw this display as utter disre- 
spect for life and decided to sue 
the« people because the lobster was 
alive ft+ien they chopped it into pieces. 

Now, I can understand If the 



&gt;uld r 



i blowi 



head off with a shotgun (which I 
heard Is sometimes done) or cut 
a chicken's head off on televi- 
sion. Maybe you would have a 
point. &amp;ut these people were Just 
preparing food. Who cares7 

See, my major thing with some of 



Oiese so-eaDed jctw groups » that 
they never knew when to keep theu- 
noses out of people's business, kkid 
of like reporters, ya know But there 
Is a big difference. Reporters know 
when to butt the hell out; whereas 
these folks don't. It's our Job u&gt; frd 
out if somebody ts breaking the law 
and then e»pose ft for what It Hs. ICs 
also our Job to keep people apprised 
Of what Is goffig on. 

These action groups find certain 
Isolated Incidents and then exploit 
tnem for their own selfish reasons, 
which Is wrong, Every time a group 
makes a frf/olous claim or e*p\oiP9 a 
situation. It undermines and draws 
attention away from valid Issues. I 
whole-heartedly believe that there are 
some cases we do have to examine 
and. when warranted, defend the 
rights of mistreated animals. But. 
hey food Is food. What else w«re lob- 
sters, cows. fish, and chickens put 
here for? 

And of course there Is always the 
comeback that we must become plant 
eaters (vegetarians). 1 don't think so. 
I like my vegetables, but I also like my 
meat. And I've got to have them both. 

I Just think It's ridiculous that 
people have to stretch things out of 
proportion In a selfish effort to make 
things "right," when In fact the crnty 
thing they have to do to Just butt the 
hell out... But you didn't hear that 



Gay and lesbian group holds first meeting 



B« FUm Doom 
Activities Editor 



Silting upsiiixi in 'Ik lounge vca 
located outside of tbe Student! 
Government office, a handful of IPFW 
students listen to Paul Tupper declare: 
"We have arrived ALSO U an official 
student organization on campus." 

ALSO is a student organization 
designed to meet the needs of gay and 
lesbian students on campus. 

Tupper, a freshman and president of 
ALSO, expressed his excitement in the 
new organization. 

There is a need for an organization 
on this campus so people will know that 
we (gays and lesbians) will not be put 
aside," said Tupper. 

The group recently won approval in 
the IPFW Student Senate last month 
amid controversy. 

As reported in the June 2 issue of 
The Communicator, a source alleged 
that a member of the Campus 
Organizations Committee wanted lo 
delay approval of ALSO's constitution 
because "Indiana is a conservative state 
and IPFW is a conservative 
campus... students wouldn't want a gay 
and lesbian organization on campus." 

Maureen Voors, an rPFW senior and 
a member of ALSO, feels thai slale- 
ments like Ibis merely precipitate the 
formation of groups thai address gay 
and lesbian issues. 

'1 don't think this 
campus," Voois said. "Beci 
nothing that addresses gay 
issues, wc have loo." 

Most of ALSOs members feci form- 



ng a group on campus will allow people 
who are homosexual lo feel comfortable 
arxiut their sexuality in a predominantly 
heterosexual environment. 

Derrick Diniels. a member of 
ALSO, feels thai it is important for 
homosexuals to be out and allowed lo 
express their sexuality. 

"It's a pan of our being No one 
can really get to know someone 
without knowing tbeir sexuality 
thai would wipe out a large group of 
questions." Daniels said "When I 
lie, I'm not being myself. I have lo 



bell 



elf." 



e there is 
id lesbian 



Voors echoed Daniel's concern 
about being allowed lo be themselves in 
any situation. "It's very important 
because some people are dill naive 
They think that homosexuality is only 
allowed in other cities." 

Greg Callcn. director of Student 
Activities, feels strongly that a group 
such as this is needed if there is an inter- 
est among the student population. 

"Anytime you have a group thai ser- 
vices a portion of the campus popula- 
tion, it's a good thing," said Callcn 

According lo a campus climate sur- 
vey conducted at IPFW in September of 
1992 conducted by tbe Council on 
Minority Recruitment and Retention, 45 
percent of students surveyed felt that 
gays and lesbians experience prejudice, 
whereas 31 percent fell they did not. 

Since there is no way lo determine 
bow many gay and lesbian students are 
on campus, Frank Borclli. vice chancel- 
lor of Student Affairs, feels thai the only 
way lo determine the need for an organi- 
zation is based on the students' needs, 

"If Ihc students indicate a need for a 
group, it's needed," said Borelli. "I 



would hope that tbey (the campus c 
mumiv i would be receptive lo ihit 
group It's a part of diversity These 
people are • put of society, and we 
would hope that tbe university would 
accept them." 

Borelli also stated that sexual orien- 
tation ts not a protected, separate class 
on this campus, according to the student 
handbook. However, be did inform The 
Communicator thai discrimination on 
Ihc basis of sexual orientation is jusl tbe 
same is discrimination based on gender 
or ethnicity, and would not be accepted, 

"I don't think wc need a sludent 
group to change ibe code We really 
don't need a reason because il's jusl tbe 
right thing to do." Borelli said. 

Members of ALSO arc aware lhal 
there arc some individuals out their who 
are filled with hate and ignorance and 
may use violence as a form of exprcs- 

Tbe members feel thai ihc best way 

lo combat any ignorance is through cdu- 

"When I was boshed, it hurt for days. 
No matter what Ihey say or do, I will 
always bounce back." said Tapper. 

"Wc have lo Tight for freedom. If 
Blacks didn't fight hack, ihey wouldn't 
have received their freedom The same 
goes for us. Wc have to prove II, " 
Tupper added. 

Along with increasing membership, 
ALSO will be participating in SOAR 
and planning fund-raisers for fulure 
events such as speakers and public panel 

'Open your mouth. Tell your straight 
friends who know about you lo tell ihcir 
othcr gay friends. We need you," 

Tupper commented. ♦
