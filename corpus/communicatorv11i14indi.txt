NOW YOU CAN 

EARN OVER 

$6,500 WITH 

ARMY ROTC. 



Before you graduate from college! Because now, you can com- 
bine service in the Army Reserve or National Guard with Army 
ROTC. It's called the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP). 
And, depending on your academic year when you enter, SMP 
can help you earn over $6,500. 

Here's how it works. If you qualify and a vacancy is available, 
you become a member of an Army Reserve or National Guard unit 
as an officer trainee and, at the same time, enroll in the Army 
ROTC advanced course at your college. Your Reserve or Guard 
membership will pay you at the minimum level of Sergeant E-5, 
and you'll receive $100 a month during the regular school year as 
an Army ROTC advanced course cadet. 

At the end of your second year of advanced ROTC, you'll be 
commissioned a second lieutenant and, assuming there's a vacancy, 
serve with a Guard or Reserve unit while you complete the 
requirements for your college degree. 

So if you'd like to earn over $6,500 while you're still in college, 
get into SMP. Because SMP can help you do it. You can bank on it!
