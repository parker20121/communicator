Best voter turnout in several years

The ICSGA Spring 2000 elec-

which look place on March 28 and

Lunouis in a'ccoi history. 
Allogeiher, 598 snidenLs vded in itic 
election. 

"I 9!3i very pleased wilh voler 
ILimoul." said Joe Schrocder, cumrni 
sludcni body presidcni. "Ii wn one 
of the highcsl in history." 

Schraciler dlil not run in the 
cicclion because be is gmdualing a1 
ibe end of Ihc sctncstcr. Instead. Ihc 
sludenl body presidcni position wai 
contested by siudcnis Nick day, 
Tonya Ryan ind Cecilia Taylor. Of 
the three candidates. Gray came out 
on [Op uitb 375 votes out or a lout 
566 voles casi for Uul po.^ilion. 

Gray, a secondary education 
maior, ha.s scri'ed in the Senale for 
Uucc years. He said there are a lot or 
changes he would like to icc lake 
place a I IfTAV. 

"i guess 1 had a lol of idcai 1 
v,anicd lo gei across." Cjray said. 
"BcDig presidcni helps you gel (hose 
ideas Uuough." 

Schcocdcr is conlldeni Gray 
will do a good job as sludem body 
president. "I'm very happy iviiib 
Nick." Schrocder said, "He'll do a 
greaijob. He has a lot of experience 
in the Senate and I'm sure he'll look 



rorusid li 









The olher position (hat saw a 
change in omcc was the complroller 
posi 110(1. which Randy Spicer. who 
is also graduating this year, cuirent- 
ly holds. The results for compirollet 
aiTK ID with Malt McE)DnaliJ win- 
ning over Bryan Scott. 306-227. 

As complroller, McDonald 
said he is going to be in charge of 
overseeing budget tnauers and con- 
trolling money. He plans on doing 
more than just that, though. "I have 
a lot of ideas Uial I'm going io be 
bringing to the Senate thai I think 
could improve the student body as a 
ubolc. I want to try lo gel the slu- 
dents more involved," he said. "Not 
many students arc involved with 
anylhing and the lumout al the 
events is preliy low." 

McDonald said that as close as 
his race was, he said be originally 
tlwugbi it vm going &lt;o be dosei. "Ii 
was a lot of woric." he .'aid. "Bryan 
was oul there doing quite a bil of 
campaigning and so was I. It was a 
light race. I acniatiy thougbl il was 
going to be closer than what il was." 

In contrast, Jim Corson, who 
was re-elected student body vice 
president In a 303-2+4 victory over 
Rob Lopci. said ihai he didn't think 
his race was going lo be as dose as. 
il coded up ticing. "I was actually 
iutpiiscd by the closeness of the 
race. I really didn'l think it would be 
diaiclosc and il was. I ihi&gt;ughi il was 
a lol more one-sidaJ," Corson said. 
"Rob bad some good issues, but he 
wa.sn'l really available a lot on cam- 
pus and a loiof pcopli 



who be was I figured thai ihat was 
something Ibat would go against 
hmi, bui apparently be knew mote 
people than I ihoughL It was a 1&lt;&gt;i 
closer dian I thought" 

One of Corson's in-ori"n.c 
goals for ihe nexi year is similar to 
one of Gray's — revising the way the 
scheduling of classes is handled. 
"Tbc class scheduling here on cam- 
pus is just honendous," Corson said. 
"If you'ie a Junior or a senior and 
you have some of ihe higher-level 
classes, some times they're only 
olTered once a year and sometimes 
they're only olTeted once every two 
years. Thai's absoluiely ridiculous " 

Gray also doesn't like Ihc way 
class schedules arc handled. "If you 
are ajunior, you have 10 guess if the 
class you need will be offered the 
toltowmg fall when you need it." be 

Jenec Johnson, vice president 
tor ptogTBmming. was also re-elect- 
ed as she defeated Shatvn ilcwlcl 
370-160. Jcnee. who is presidcm ci 
the Siudeni Activities Board a.s pari 
of her position, said that sbe wauLs 
10 do whatever she can lo sec IPFW 
grow as a campus. "1 would Idte to 
make a change in gelling more peo- 
ple awaresUll of what we do as well 
as getting better programming. 1 still 
want to bhng in a bigger concert 
That was kind of a side Itiing this 
year, bui we came close lo doing il 
unUl plans changed all of a sudden '* 

Another thing Johnson wants 
is 10 see IPFW grow as a campus, "I 
want to take more of a big umversi- 
ly appeal and stop thinking thai 
smaller universiiy." The

Omnibus lectures arc only attended 
by smdents who need to write a 
repon on diem. AtbleUc events are 
mos( often attended by d&gt;e friends 
and (amllies of the players. The 
whole thing is absolutely disgusting 
when one Uiinks about it. Wtiat ever 
happened to pride in one's scbool? 

The argument has been used 
diat IPFW is 
and diat none of the s(uden(s who go 
here have die (ime to go lo these 
events because of work. Is it really 
true that IPf^' students work so 
much, though? What about die peo- 
ple we hear about going to bars widi 
friends during die week or die ones 
who come in talking about their 
favorite television shows every day? 
Aj^atenily, these people have free 
(ime. Do (hey jus( no( care about die

I've also heard that (hat number u

makes me happy that IPFW sluden(s

(hat needs to be kept in mind. 

The candidates for die contesi-

people to vote for dicm. 'fiiis was

In conclusion, I'd just Idee to 
say that I am very happy about die

increase in participation wdl be seen

Tbis IS ibe college 1 plan on graduat-

Wrestlemania 2000's shock and (dismay 



by Ben Freese, Sta/f Wtiter 

Well, HTesding fans, here wc 
are after sixteen years ot watching 
the World Wrestling Federation's 

Wrestlemania Mo( onlyiJiave die 

game and tlic players changed, but 
now die promoter mind-sel has 
swayed to becoming "what's shock- 
ing enough?" and 'what will fool 

I remember a day long ago 
when I enjoyed wreslhng due to lis 

(before (bis new mindset). A dmc 
when die fans ahnost always went 
bome happy (something WWF has 
always spcciahied in, i.e. bave the 
good guy win at the end of the show 
or build to dieir biggest event and 
"put orer" the most popular wrestler 
in die main match). 

Sure, wrestling itself tias been 
using this new mmdsct die past three 
years to an extent, but I've never 
seen Uic WWF so btaiandy send its 
fans home unhappy. What I'm talk- 
ing atiout Is die main event maleh 
labeled as a fatal four-way which 
featured Champion Triple H, Mick 
Foley, Tbc Big Show arid Tbc Rock. 
Of course, everyone assumed 
Triple H {die head WWF bad guy) 
was going to lose his dde on diis 
night and die WWF would christen a 
new champion cither in dw form of 
Mick Foley or Tbc Rock (die fcdcra- 
oon's two most popular wtesUcn). 

At least, that's what you'd 
diink, considering it's die biggest 
show of die year and (be WWF 
always sends the fans borne happy. 
For some reason, certainly not any- 
diing logical, die new mindset won 
over ,ind HHH won the match to 
retain bis tide. Why? No one expect- 
ed or could have predicted it and 
diat's die only thing [Tomolers care 
about anymore. Since when did 
"fooling (he tans" become more 
important dien pleasing (hem for 
paying £49.95 (O watch an event thai 
should excite them enough lo buy (he 

1 led you what, diey can gel 
away with ibis now because the 
WWF is hotter dmn ever, but if (hey 
keep (his kind of crap up. why will 
anybody want to watch dielr shows? 
Think abou( ic Do wresding fans 
watch Ihese shows to see how a pro- 
moter will fool diem or ui see tbeir 
favorite guy beat die bad guy and 



win (he world title? 

I shudder to diink bow some 
fans may answer tha( last question. I 
don't know about everybody else, 
but.l warned lo sec the logical popu- 
lar clfolCc win out and, lo (ha( end. 1 
was severely disappoimed Id 
Wrestlemania. 

Fust ot all, die opening matcb- 
cs (or die Tirst hour of the show were 
terrible and the fans at ringside 
showed no reaction. Had (he audi- 
ence been shocked Into silence? I ask 
diis. because when die lalcr matches 
widi die more "over" (popular) 
superstars happened, the crowd bare- 
ly reacted again. Sure, dicre was (he 
shock of die multiple UUe changes 
(Edge and Christian won die tag

and die Hardy s in probably (he licst 
bout of (he show, Chris lericho and

It cannot be discounted, howev- 
er, that die fans left unhappy widiout 
dieir favorite wrestler as champion in 
die main evenL My question after 
seeing Wrestlemania. a bad show 
with mosdy liad matches, a disap- 
pointing main event and a tepid 
crowd reaction to everything on die 
show: Why would somebody pay 50 
bucks to see diis on pay per view or 
1000 dollars for tront row ringside 

Actually, diat's Uie question 
everybody's probably asking them- 
selves AFIPR die event. For die 
WWFs sake (seeing as how I'm a 
life-long fan who's walched for more 
dicn eleven years slraighi), I hope 
they figure out diis isn't die winning 
formula before Uicy sian to lose (heir

'The American' captures the emotions of 
Angie Aparo 



by Man Gosherl, 
Staff Wriler 



Artist; Angle Aparo 
Album: "The American" 



Genre: Alternative/Acoustic 



Rating: 3.3 out of 5 

"To me, performing is about 
much more than even the pcrfomicr 
getting into the songs.. 
Peifonning is an interchange: it's 
mutual." Angle Apan&gt; said in an 
interview on www.angieaparo com. 

Aparo's nesu CD. The 
American." accomplishes thai goal 
with intensity. "The American." 
which was produced by Matt 
Scilctic who has also produced 
albums for bands such as hiaicbboi 
20. Collective Soul and Aerostnith, 



captunrs tbe anist' 
and amplifies ii into some 
great music. ^Tlie 
American" is an album 
thai Ls Tilled with deep, 
soulful melodies that are 
invigorating, as well as 
soothing. 

Apaio's song writing 
is something thai really 
stands out on the album. "I 
write es-ery day-generally 
starting in the morning, I 
open up to a kmd of stream 
of consciousness." 
Aparo said on 
www.angicaparo.coin. 
"About 90 percent of tbe

driving in my car. I gel

thai goal and then some. If

Cusacks's career at a 'high' point

l&gt;Idly enough, Cusack, despite his 
twyish looks and amiable trails that 
would pby well to a mainstream 
audience, has opted to be daring 
with his canxr and star in edgy fibns 
like "Gros.se Point Blank" (a violent 
Tihn about a lovable hitman) and 
"Being John Malkovicb" (in which 
he plays a puppoieer who discovers 
a ponal into actor John Malkoricb's

"High Fidelity" bascdon the famous 
British novel of the same name and

First-year stuaent from Peru acUusts to life in Fort Wayne 



by Kerrin LangJord, 
SlaH Writer 

Pcni. almost ibe !iz£ of Alaska, 
IS ihc childhood bamc of t&gt;uilio 
Alaiana. Coming Trom a place 
wbcic ibc icmfcniiurc is moderaie 
year round iind miJil eanbqiiakcs oic 

Fon Wayne. Due lo lencrisi aiuciLs 
and bccauM of tils Taihcr's posiUon 
in tlic Peruvian air torce, be came (o 
Fon Wayne in Scpicmber 19*1. 

Currenlly in his rinl-yeai al 
IPFW, Atarama plans id major in 
L'beral arts. "I am majoring in Lber- 
il aru and warn lo go on id design 
school, possibly in OHcago," said 
Aiarama. Alihougli Alaranu is com- 
ptcling a play he bas been working 
□n, be aspires (o learn how lo design 
clolliiDg and would Uke lo cuploic 
Ibe possibiliiy or acling. 

school for rive years. Ttis school, 
associaled with ihe air fo(cc, was 
locaied wilhin a militaiy conununi- 
ly. Although in his culture people 
are more imponant (ban schedules, 
tbe iniliiary school uugbl bim lo 
always be on time. "Tlicy checked 
Ihc lengOi o( my hair, the back of my 
collar, my shoes, nails and uniroim 
every day." said Alaiama Public 
cducalion in Peru is Tree and only 
required bclwcen ages Kvcn ,'uid 
sixieen. Unlike many Peruvians, 
Aiarama had bcnerits because his 
ladicT was in the milllary. 

Education in Peru is mucb dif- 
(ercnl from how it is in America. 
"For eiamplc, "Prunary and second- 
ary school are usually joined togeth- 
er as one school,' said Ataiama 

Since the ans are very cipcn- 
sive in his country, when Aiarama 
wenl to South Side High School a( 
age 14. be chose as many an classes 
as be could- Although Alaiama uas 
supposed to be a sojAomorc when 
be got here, hi was held back lo 
allow him tbe china; to belter grasp 
the English language. 

According iirAtaraina. in Peru 
one stays ui tbe same clauroom, 
c«n though on iliffcieni days they 
Icam diffcreni subjects. "I was so 



conluscd when I got here because 1 
had lo keep switching classrooms, 
and the subjects were taugbl at tbe 
same tune each day." he explained. 
Aiarama also noted that in Peru slu* 
denLs don'i get to choose their own 

Ndi only arc teachers looked up 
to as second parents, the schedule is 
different. "In my culture the teach- 
eis are allowed to spank. When I 
got here 1 was uncomTonablc when 
sludcnis ss'ould raise their soiccs in 
class," said Atarama. 

Atarama bas strong feelings 
about hLs culture's language. 
Although Ataiama had been taught 
how lo wnle in English, he did not 
know how lo speak it. "I worried 
thai il 1 only bung around my 
Hispanic friends in my summer ESL 
class, I woultln'l fully grssp the 
English language. How arc you 
going to get along, widioui learoisg 
EnglisbT' Atarama asked. 

However. Atarama said, "If I 
have kids, Ihey will speak Spanish 
in the home and leant English ai 
school I know some friends thai 
don't believe in keeping their 
Spaiush language " Atarama knows 
bow to speak Spanish, English and a 
little French. Portuguese and Italian. 

Because Aiarama's younger 
brodicr had to have special medical 

received a scholarship to learn 
English, Alaiama was ^le to visit 
America long before he came here 
in 1994. These events were the cata- 
lyst which led to a major change in 
the family's religious practices. 
Visiting Baptists in America paid his 
family a visit while bis brother was 
gomg through tough times. Then a 
Christian speaker who motivated bis 
parents to save their marriage led to 
his family changing from the pre- 
dominanUy Catholic faith practiced 
in most of Peru 

'Because il is cuslomary in 
Hispanic culture to save a maniage 
against all odds, my Mom especially 
was trying to save her mamage with 
my dad,' said Aiarama. A guesi 
Cbiisiian pastor who spoke about 
saving marriages strongly influ- 
enced the successful tum around of 
his parents' marriage when Atarama 



was ten years old, "Now my 
mom and dad have been married 
tor 27 year;,' Atarama said. 

He explained that many 
llispanics do tait a weakness. 
"A weakness in Hispanic culture 
is that we like lo help people, 
citbcr by lending diem money, or 
often by doing ihem favors only 
to be taken advantage of." said 

Tbe most imponant thing m 
Atarama's life is his faiUi and 
family 'You have lo have some 
kind of spiritual grounding." said 
Atarama. In addition, neighbors, 
like family, share in the celebra- 
tion of holidays. "Inmy country, 
since the houses are so close 
together, you go from house lo 
house for Chtisunas or New 
Year's, until as laic as 4 and 5 
ajn,." Aiarama reminisced. 

Family discipline is also 
viewed differenily. Although 
discipline, such as spanking, is 
allowed among Pcnivlan fami- 
lies, bis father warned him not lo 
spardc if be ever bad kids in 
America. "My dad once told me 
that if I become a parent over 
here. 1 cannol hit my cbdd for 
disciplinary reasons, or the 
police will come," said Aiarama. 

Looking on the brighter 
side of things, Alaiama said. 
"Tliank Cod t have not had a 
problem with my tacc so far. I 
think the most imponani thing is 
you must be respectful." 
According to Atarama. if some in 
the Hispanic culture are disre- 
spectful, it seems e«ry Hispanic 
becomes dubbed ^s diough this 
were a common trait among 
them all. 

He also notia-d how long it 
took him to go through the 
piDCCu of becoming a resident. "Il
