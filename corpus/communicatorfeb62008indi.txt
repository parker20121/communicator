ViOUS importance 
the upcoming election, 
Americans seem to have 
forgoiien about the war 
in Iraq. In the last few 
weeks especially, public 
discourse has been more 
focused on pop culture 
than foreign policy. 

According to data 
from the Pew Research 



the public's in- 
n the Iraq war 
Red an all-time low 
last month. The week of 
January 21, the media 
spent twice as much time 
covering the death of ac- 
tor Heath Ledger as it did 
the ongoing war in Iraq. 

Similarly, twdce as 
many Americans report- 
ed following the Ledger 
story the closest as had 
followed the Iraq conflict 
the closest. 

In the same lime pe- 
riod, the media spent 19 
percent of its time cov- 
ering economic issues. 



During these discus- 
sions, the war seldom if 
ever was mentioned. It 
appears that most jour- 
nalists do not consider 
the $700 billion spent in 
Iraq and Afghanistan to 
have had any impact on 
the economy.

the United States was 
still at its infancy. 

While China's text 
messaging was being fil- 
ccred and regulated for 
criticism by their com- 
munist government, 
democratic America was 
barely catching on. 

Today, sending a cou- 
ple hundred texts a day, 
Sophomore at IPFW. Ra- 
cliel Gumbiner loves text 
messaging. 

T\i C-H's study. "How 
Chinese Perceives Social 
Presence: An Examina- 
tion of Interaction in 
Online Learning Envi- 
ronment" stated thai, 
"Chinese Ipeople! are ac- 
customed lo processing 
information from cither 
a physical context or an 
inlcmalized apprecia- 
tion of Ihe person." 



"Text 

makes it easier for me to 
talk to my boyfriend who 
is in the army. I can do 
it in class or wherever I 
want," Gumbiner said. 

Naturally, people are 
more effective in analyz- 
ing language in the pres- 
ence of whom they are 
communicating with. 
Even though available 
variables such as tone, 
eye contact, or body lan- 
guage are relevant and 
important to the effec- 
tiveness of communicat- 
ing, the college demo- 
graphic is finding it easier 
and more convenient. 

Though the rapidity 
of lext message growth 
insinuates an audacious 
popularity people can't 
ignore, there are a stiL 
people who can't commit 



to tcxtjng all the time. 

Darlk Boutsaboualoy, 
an Electrical Engineer- 
ing Technology major 
at IPFW texls less ihan 
Gumbiner, but enjoys 
the convenience. 

" I text about ten lo 15 
messages a day and find 
it easier to talk to some- 
body if you text them," 
Boutsaboualoy said. 

Though some have 
the option of protecting 
their eyes from the glare 
of tlie sun, people still 
have the convenience 
of being a Chinese 
judge, hiding behind the 
shades, expressionless. 
Text messaging may have 
made communication 
easier, but it's still a mes- 
sage behind a thin piece 
of glass.

Still undecided? 

Three Web sites help voters connect with candidates 



By DOUGLAS SCHMIDT 

ichmdnDI@ipfw edu 



No matter how long 
the campaign season 
gets, it seems that some 
voters will always wait 
until the last minute to 
make the big decision. 
Should the next presi- 
dent be Rorrmey or Mc- 
Cain? Clinton or Obama? 
For those who need help 
making up their minds, 
the Web may just have 
the answer. 

Glassbooth [http:// 
glassbooth.org) is a 
nonpartisan site with a 
questionnaire developed 
from over 270 hours of 
research. 

First, users are asked 
which issues they feel 
are most important. The 
more points users give 
an issue, ihe more ques- 
tions they will be asked 
on that subject and the 
more weigh t will be given 
to their responses. Next, 
users are asked 20 ques- 
tions. 

Users give answers on 
a sliding, five-point scale 
similar to a Scantron test. 
Each question has a link 



to a Wikipedia article 
with more information 
on that particular issue. 
Finally, users are shown 
the candidate that most 
closely matches their 
beliefs. Users can click 
onanycandidate'sname 
to see how closely he or 
she agrees ivith them on 
a given issue. 

Political Base (http:// 
www.pol it leal base, 
com) offers a simpler 
quiz than Glassbooth. 
Each user is asked the 
same set of questions 
and users have no way 
to weight one issue 
heavier than another. 

However, instead of 
simply offering links 
10 Wikipedia, the site 
maintains its own infor- 
mation pages on each 
issue and candidate. 
Quiz results are similar 
to Glassboolh's; Users 
are shown which can- 
didates match them 
die closest and which 
disagree with ihem the 
most. They can also 
click on any candidate 
to see where he or she 
stands on any given is- 
sue. 

In addition to the 
primaries quiz. Politi- 



cal Base is updated daily 
ivith the latest news, poll 
results and more. The site 
also offers in-depth infor- 
mation on campaign con- 
tributions, user forums 
and, for those who need 
a refresher civics course, 
a detailed description of 
the workings of the federal 
government. 

Electoral Compass 
(hltp://www.elector- 
alcompass.com) of- 

fers fewer features than 
Glassbooth and Political 
Base, but it has its own 
advantages. The quiz is 
the quickest of the three, 
which may appeal to busy 
students. Also, the site dis- 
plays results in an easy to 
follow, visual format. 

Users are shown their 
position on a left/righl, 
liberal/conservative axis 
and where each candidate 
is in relation to them. 

Of course, no match 
wrill be perfect. If there 
were only ten questions, 
each with a "yes or no" an- 
swer, we would need 1 ,02"! 
candidates for there to be 
a perfect president for ev- 
eryone. Still, these sites 
offer a quick and fun way 
to become more informed 
about the issues.

HObking Up 

By JESSIE RUCKMAN T" ^ %^_ V B 



It's benveen the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. 
The sun has sel and the moon is full, and the ani- 
mal wants lo come out and play. But who to call? 
And how exactly does one go about making that 
phone call or random text? 
TliP Prp-Ci;illlP 

Your prey may be a friend from school, some 
hottieinclassthatyou'vehadyoureyesonorsome 
random person you met at Piere's. li doesn't mat- 
ter. You want it, and you're hoping the other per- 
son does 100, Maybe you should call that person, 
just to see what's happening with them... if they're 
bus&gt;' or feel like pla&gt;'ing 'Doctor' as well. So, palms 
sweating and nerves jumping, you make the call. 
Tiilk tlu- 'i'jilk 

Rule Number One: do NOT text this person 
for romance. That is the epitome of (he detached 
hookup and takes away from the homess of tlie 
one-on-one encounter. At least let the person 
hear your voice. As a pleasant side effect, perhaps 



ThisWeekIn 



that person can hear your excitement. 

So now the phone is ringing and Dream Person 
answers the phone. What the heck do you say? Do 
NOT trip all over yourself in a lame attempt to make 
the big. bootylicious request. For goodness sake, 
rehearse a little before you pick up the phone, you 
amateur. 
The Hookiip 

Let's say the phone call worked and your prey is 
lusting after you as well,.. The door is left unlocked, 
candles lit and you are looking ail twenty shades 
of sexy. The door opens, that person steps in and 
-well. Things happen, the earth moves, whatever, 
Tlie Aftci-iiiiitli 

Oh, the awkwardness of post-hookup chitchat. 
So, does one politely ask their prey to leave post 
hookup? Depends on tlie experience. If the quality 
one-on-one time was worth the time and/or the ef- 
fort, rinse and repeat. If not, chuck the number and 
look for something better.

The police have visited Britney Spears home in the gated community. The 
Summit, twice last week. Earlier in the week because of some major drama with 
her "manager" Osama Lutfi and later on in the week, because supposedly Brit-Brit 
tried to commit suicide. According to perezhilton.com, she is going to be com- 
mined for psychiatric evalution. 1 hope this is true, girifriend needs some serious 
help. Update: Britney Spears has been committed for the next 72 hours! 

IE has yet to be confirmed by Gwen Stefani, but her father-in-law has con- 
firrned she is expecting again. 

Brangelina was seen strutting the red carpel at Screen Actors Guild Awards 
wearing a i.Lo-esque dress, sporting less the normal "curves". Anyday now and 
she will come out and let the world know she's preggers, yet again. 

It's also been reported twice this week that l.Lo has been admitted to the hos- 
pital for the birth of what maybe twins. Both reports have been denied. 

Reportedly, Nancy Camvrlght, the voice of The Simpsons, Bart, gave upwards 
of $10,000,000 to the Church of Scientology. 

Paris Hilton is supposed to be revealing a shoe hne, that's both "affordable and 
comfortable". Results should be very interesting. 

Eva [blendes has checked into rehab. Supposedly, she is at the same rehab fa- 
cility La-Lohan stayed in Utah. 

Lindsay Lohan has been seen partying again.. .REtlAB! 

Justin Chambers, from Grey's Anatomy, has voluntarily checked himself into a 
psych ward! fie reportedly has been troubling sleeping and is exhausted. 

The Spice Giris have announced that they wiU be ending their massive world- 
lour at tlie end of February. Seems the girls have other things to attend to. 

Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman's ex-husband, and his girlfriend Ryan 
Shawhughes, are expecting their first child.

suprises, 
&amp; thrills 



ByANDREJjVSTACKHOUSE 



Another Asian hor- 
ror remake opened in 
theatres vvith weekend, 
with Jessica Alba as the 
title star. Though "The 
Eye," a remake of a 
Hong Kong horror film, 
"Gin Gwai," doesn't 
prove itself as the best 
new movie of ihe sea- 
son, it does fit nicely 
among it's remake pre- 
decessors. _^^_, 

The story 
centers around 
Sydney Wells 
(Aiba), a blind 
violinist who 



the transplant gave 
her more than she 
wanted. The ability to 
see the dead. Sydney 
is soon accosted by 
the distorted images of 
the dead in all aspects 
of her life, leading her 
to question her can- 
ity. She then sets out 
to find more informa- ' 
tion about the person 
whose cornea's she 
was given, in an effort 
to understand the ter- 
rif^ang visions she has 



her 



sight after a 
cornea trans- 
plant. While she slowly 
comes to grips with 



"While the images are 

scary or unexpected, 

they're never overly 

grotesque." 




still rely- 
much 



good looks. 
Parker Posey 
does well as Helen, 
Sydney's worried 
sister Likewise, Ales- 
sand ro Nivola plays 



begun seeing. 

The acting in "The the part of Sydney's 

her newly reacquired Eye" is moderately doctor well, and some 

sense, she realizes that good. Alba plays her on-screen chemistry 



tween 

the tivo is evident. 

The real draw of this 
film is the special ef- 
fects. The spectral, su- 
pernatural scenes Syd- 
ney bares witness to 



la ted to the 
film. These thrilling 
images also never dig 
into the typical "Saw" 
or "Hostel" style of 
horror. While the im- 
ages are scary or unex- 



pected, they're never 
overly grotesque. This 
makes for a less stom- 
ach-churning movie 
going experience. 

While "The Eye" 
surely won't dazzle 
your mind, it remains 
an entertaining thriller 
with some horror el- 
ements added In for 
fiair. 



Over Her Dead Movie 



ly ANDREW STACKHOUSE 

icyrainehDUnail.corn 



Jeff Lowell's "Over 
Her Dead Body" is only 
tolerable if: you like 
chick' flicks a lot. you're 
easily amused, or you 
need to kill an hour and 
a half. Otherwise, avoid 
this movie at all costs. 

"Over He r Dead Body- 
finds Eva Longoria Park- 
er playing bridezilla Kate 
on the day of her wed- 
ding. As she runs around 
trying to make every- 
thing perfect on her spe- 
cial day an ice sculpture 
of an angel kills her. Af- 
ter several months pass 
with former-fiance Hen- 
ry (Paul Rudd) still griev- 
ing, his cousin sends him 
to psychic/caterer Ash- 
ley (Lake Bell), Ashley 
ends up falling for Henry 
but then has to deal with 
Kate's angered spirit, who 
is less than thrilled v&gt;nth 
this new romance, lypi- 
cal romantic comedy 



hijinks ensue, including 
funny odd scenes with a 
priest, a parrot, and flat- 
ulence. Yes, flatulence in 
a chick flick. Be warned. 

In most other cases, 
theabove plot would pass 
by as being just anotlierC 
or B level romantic com- 
edy. However, the acting 
and script just aren't up 
to snuff, and considering 
the genre this movie is 
in, that's surprising. Eva 
Longoria Parker's char- 
acter is the same as her 
"Desperate Housewives" 
counterpart, GabrielJe, 
yet the acting comes 
off a lot vJorse. Kate re- 
mains wooden and an- 
noying and never rises to 
Gabrielle's charms, Paul 
Rudd and Lake Bell both 
perform acceptably but 
without remark. 

Though this movie 
has it's occasional comic 
and romantic moments, 
they are too few and far 
between to warrant the 
money it will cost to see

IPFW Alumni Spotlight 

Former students recall memories of years 
spent at IPFW, tell where they are now 



By KATY ANDERSON 

AndEknD16ip Kv.edu 



Ever find yourself 
wondering if any- 
thing exciting ever 
happens to IPFW 
graduates? Al- 

though IPFW may 
not be a university 
that is well-known 
across the coun- 
try and is typically 
viewed as a smaller 
school in a not-so- 
large city, former 
IPFW students are 
still impacting their 
communities and 
leading productive 
lives. 

IPFW alumni 
Karen Goldner 
and performer and 
coach Daniel Baker 
share both good 
and bad memories 
whUe at IPFW, and 
how their endeav- 
ors eventually paid 
off. 






Second district city 
coucU member Karen 
Goldner graduated 

from IPFW in 1989 with 
a Masters of Public Ad- 
ministration bi SPEA. 

Conunutdcator: What 
have you been up to 
since you graduated 

from IPFW? 



1986-2003 and now with 
Fourth Wave, a soft^vare 
and investment compa- 
ny (2003 -present). Ihave 
taught a couple of under- 
graduate classes at iPFW 
as an adjunct, as well. 
C: What was your favorite 
moment while attending 
IPFW? 

KG: Great discussions 
in Dr. Rosentraub's Eco- 
nomic Development 

C: What was your least 
favorite moment while 
anending IPFW? 
KG: Realizing that i had 
studied the wrong ma- 
terial for one of Dr. Lud- 
win's classes. 

C: Doyou have any words 
of wisdom for current or 
potenllai IPFW students? 
KG: Be ail in and really 
participate in your own 
educa- 




roles. 1 have also done 
several television com- 
mercials that can be seen 
throughout Indiana. 

I have also been work- 
ing as a private voice 
teacher, vocal coach, and 
contest adjudicator for 
high schools in the area. 
Schools have hired me to 
come in and work with 
their students both on 
an individual basis and 
also in groups. During 
the spring. I judge high 
school show choir com- 



I owe my successes both 
then and now to her. 



C: What was your least 
favorite moment while 
attending IPFW? 
DB: My leastfavorite mo- 
ment while at IPFW was 
having to take 24 credit 
hours in a semester. Also 
being a music major, that 
didn't mean eight 
three-credit hour classes, 
but 12 classes ranging 
from one to three credit

rebounds, but missed 
a clutch free throw late 
that would have tied 
the game. 

Last Monday, the 
Mastodons shocked 
the Summit League's 



top team in Western Il- 
linois. 

IPFW got 23 points 
from Lewis-Carlisle 
and a career-high 17 
points from senior for- 
ward Natalie Roberts to 
hand the Westerwinds 
only their second con- 
ference loss of the sea- 
son (7-2). 

The Mastodons 
started scoring as soon 
as they got off the bus 
hitting seven of their 
first eight shots in the 
game to take an 18-6 
lead. 

Freshman guard 
Sarah Haluska gave 
IPFW its largest lead 
in the half, 40-14. with 
a triple from the left 
side. 

Western Illinois se- 
nior forward Stepha- 
nie Loving finished off 
a modest 6-0 run for 
the Westerwinds with a 
lay up to cut the Mast- 
odons lead to 40-20 at 



the break. 

At the eight minute 
mark, the Westerwinds 
mounted a comeback 
when junior guard 
Sarah Miller knocked 
down a couple of 
jumpers and just like 
that, Western had cut 
the IPFW lead to 12. 

IPFW responded 
with a 12-2 run over 
the next two min- 
utes as Roberts and 
Lewis-Carlisle scored 
on driving layups and 
freshman guard Jor- 
dan Zuppe dialed one 
up from 3-point land, 
pushing the IPFW lead 
back to 22 points. 

Lewis-Carlisle's 23 
was game high. She 
also finished with four 
rebounds, six assists, 
and four steals, 

Roberts career-high 
17 included a perfect 
7-7 from the foul line.

a season high 25 from 
senior DeWitt Scott to 
lead the Mastodons to 
the 73-63 win. 

The Mastodons 

closed out the half on a 
10-2 run to take a 36-27
