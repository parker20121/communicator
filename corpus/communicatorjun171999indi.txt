New coffee house near campus offers discounts 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 

Coffee and other cafe drinks are closer to 
campus than ever since Ground Level Cafe 
opened in the Market Place of Canterbury 
recently. 





Outdoor cafe seating is also avail; 
Ground Level Cafe. 



Co-owners Jeff and Larae Marsden 
thought the location ideal for a coffee 
house and hope to increase ttu. college 
atmosphere of IPFW by being close to 
campus. 

"We wanted something close to 
IPFW for the students to come to and 
study," said Jeff Marsden, co-owner. 
In the past, the co-owners 
observed that both 1U 
Bloomlngton and- Purdue West 
Lafayette have coffee houses by 
campus and they thought IPFW 
should have one as well. 

"I wanted to set a cool coffee 
house atmosphere and also put 
out good coffee," Marsden said. 

To encourage students and fac- 
ulty to come to Ground Level 
Cafe, the co-owners give a 10 
percent discount to students and 
faculty on food and drink. Also, 
students may buy a personalized 
mug that can be kept at Ground 
Level Cafe for free house coffee 
refills each time they come in 
and purchase a coffee. 

"We really want students to 
know that the&gt; are welcome to 
come in and study and relax," 
Marsden said.

Results of recent study pose threat 
to some IPFW degree programs 



by Gail Ruble-Crawford, 
Guest Writer 



IPFW may soon find itself 
involved in a fight to keep several 
degree programs from being elimi- 
nated by Indiana's Commission for 
Higher Education. 

On May 14, the Commission 
released results from a periodic 
study it has conducted over the last 
five years on programs that have 
graduated few students 
in the last several years, 
according to Jack Dahl, 
associate vice chancellor 
for Institutional Research 
and Analysis. 

In this study, 24 
IPFW programs with 10 
or fewer graduates in the 
last five years were 
placed on a list that may 
recommend them for 
elimination sometime in 
December, said Dahl. 

According to Dahl, 
this review was released 
to various state institu- 
tions, resulting in 453 
programs facing possible 
recommendation of elimi- 
nation statewide. 

Some of the areas 
with few graduates at 
IPFW include French, 
German, fine arts, medical technolo- 
gy, pre-dentistry and pre-medicine. 

Should these programs be cut, 
students currently enrolled in the 
areas scheduled for elimination will 
be allowed to finish their degrees, 
but new students will not be admit- 



ted, s.iid Dahl. 

IPFW and other universities 
statewide are unsure of how to 
respond to the study's results. 

"State universities are trying ic 
decide how they'd like to respond; 
there's some discussion about 
whether to respond or not. We're 
going to work with our sister institu- 
tions about how to respond to this 
list," said Susan Hannah, interim vice 
chancellor of Academic Affairs. 

The motives for the study are 
being called into question by IPFW 
administrators. 

Costs will not be sig- 
nificantly lowered, said 
Hannah, because IPFW 
will still offer classes in 
these areas, as they ful- 
fill humanities require- 
ments for students in 
other majors. 

Also being called into 
question is the 
Commission's power to 
enforce any recom- 
mendations that they 
make to IPFW and 
other state universities. 
According to Hannah, 
the Commission has 
the power to approve 
new programs at uni- 
versities, but it is 
unclear if they also 
have the power to 
enforce elimination of 
programs. 

Dahl agreed, "It is not a fore- 
gone conclusion that these programs 
will all be cut or eliminated." 

The threat of elimination of 
these degree programs seems to 
make little sense to IPFW 



"We have to serve 
a large geograph- 
ic area, and those 
programs are 
important to us. It 
is hard to imagine 
a university that 
doesn't have a 
philosophy or a 
foreign language 
program. " 

-IPFW Chancellor 
Michael Wartell 



administrators. 

"We have to serve a large geo- 
graphic area, and those programs are 
important to us. It is hard to imagine 
a university that doesn't have a phi- 
losophy or a foreign language pro- 
gram," said IPFW Chancellor Michael 
Wartell. 

Wartell was also disturbed by 
the study's use of the word "house- 
keeping" in its explanation of the 
study's usefulness because he felt 
that it wasn't being fair to the uni- 
versities it targets, 

"They're just looking at the 
numbers," he said. 

Dahl, Hannah and Wartell said 
that IPFW will make a case for not 
eliminating certain programs. 

For example, one of the pro- 
grams listed as having "few gradu- 
ates" at IPFW is music therapy. 
Currently, IPFW has the only music 
therap) program in the state. 

Other programs are useful for 
students involved in various teach- 
ing programs, said Wartell. 

He fears that elimination or j 
reduction of these programs will 
leave students less prepared in the 
job market. 

Regardless of the confusion 
caused by this study, decisions about 
the situation will not be made any- 
time soon. 

"There are a lot of discussions 
yet to be held. The campus will pro- 
vide a response to the situation later 
this month or early in July. The 
Commission action on their decision 
for programs scheduled for elimina- 
tion will not happen until December, 
so this discussion will go on for at 
least six months," said Dahl.

How much are state commissions helping IPFW? 



WHAT WE THINK: The Indiana Commission lor Higher 
Education should answer many questions before "wiping 
out' degree programs at IPFW, 



The Indiana 
Commission for Higher 
Education has conducted a 
periodic study over the 
past five years that found 
WHAT DO YOU THINK? Send your e-mail response I, £f« ^g^S 
slupaper® holmes.tpfw.edu or a letter to Walt) 215. the i as( five years. 

Twenty-five programs 
may be cut at IPFW. 

IPFW and other Institu- 
tions have to respond to 
the review by the end of 
this month or the begin- 
ning of July before the 
commission will make any 
final decisions. 

The Commission may 
recommend eliminations 
for any program that falls 
under this category in 
December. 

These findings may 
affect 453 programs 
statewide. 

We have many ques- 
tions directed toward the 
Commission. 

What is the reasoning 
behind getting rid of a 
degree, but not the classes 
that go with the degree? 
Why should this action be 
taken if little money is 
saved? 

Why is it unclear if this 
Commission has the power 
to make recommenda- 
tions or eliminations 
of degree programs? 




Finally, what kind of 
periodic study has been 
conducted? Is it conducted 
every five years, or is it 
something they thought 
would be fun to do? 

Until these questions 
are answered, we believe 
there are too many uncer- 
tainties for the results of 
the Commission's study to 
have much meaning or pur- 
pose. 

Furthermore, this 
study seems to put IPFW in 
a state of limbo and confu- 
sion. 

Although it appears 
that IPFW does not know 
exactly what it's up against, 
the administration will 
attempt to keep some pro- 
grams from being phased 
out. 

Unfortunately, defend- 
ing existing programs when 
given "fuzzy" information is 
difficult. 

We also don't under- 
stand how getting rid of 
degree programs will help 
IPFW. 

Music therapy, philos- 
ophy, German and French 
are a few of the bachelor's 
degree programs at IPFW 
that could come to an end. 

Although a degree will 
not be available, classes 
from that degree will still 



be offered. For example, a 
U.S. in French may not be 
offered at this campus, but 
French classes will still be 
available. 

As students, we don't 
see how offering classes 
but no degrees saves any- 
thing. 

The idea that the music 
therapy program could be 
cut is would be a major loss 
to the community. 

IPFW has the only on- 
campus music therapy clin- 
ic in Indiana and it is the 
only state-funded music 
therapy program. 

HELLO!!! 

Not only has tuition 
increased on this campus 
due to continuous funding 
problems but now the pos- 
sibility that programs will 
be cut is present. 

This cut just 
means we, as students, 
will be paying more 
money for less oppor- 
tunities. 

The people who are 
being affected or "pun- 
ished" the most are the stu- 
dents. 

We believe IPFW has" 
taken enough of a beating. 

It is high time that the 
quality of our education is 
judged by something other 
than numbers. 



The two greatest people I know 



by Adam Taylor, Editor 




Father's Day is just around 
the corner which means many 
things for many different people. 

For some, it may mean a visit 
to their parents' home to spend 
quality time with their family. 

For others, it may mean a 
trip to the cemetery to give their 
fathers a posthumous gift of a 
wreath of flowers, or something to 
that extent. 

For others yet, it ma) mean a 
trip to a correctional facility to 
see a person that maybe didn't 
play the role that he was sup- 
posed to in society. 

For myself, it means a call to 
Tennessee to wish my father a 
happy Father's Day and catch up 
on what my family has been 
doing. 

This is probably only the sec- 
ond time in my life that I've had 
to make such a phone call since 
I've spent all of the other Father's 
Days in the past living with my 
family. 

Even the first time I was away 
from my dad on Father's Day I at 
least spent the day with a father 
figure, my grandfather, so the day 
still retained some son of tradi- 
tional meaning for me since 1 
spent It with family. 

Unfortunately, however, this 
year finds me spending it alone, 
or, at best, with my girlfriend and 
possibly her father. 

The circumstances that have 
led to this situation are long and 
boring. 

The&gt; can basically be 
summed up by saying my father 
puts the needs of his family first 
and, last November, made the dif- 
ficult decision of leaving one of 
his children behind while 
attempting to provide for the rest- 
In short, he was given a pay 
raise and promotion and moved 
with the rest of my family to 
Tennessee. 

The reasons why I chose to 
stay behind while the rest of my 
family went away are rather per- 
sonal to me. They know why; 1 
know why, and the few close peo- 
ple I converse with know as well. 

What it all boils down to, 
though, is that In making deci- 
sions like this one, where you 
think you're better off doing one 
thing, sometimes you have to 
make serious sacrifices. 

A decision like that came for 
me when I removed myself from 
the presence of my parents, two 
of the greatest people I've had the 
pleasure to know. 

My mother has always played 
some sort of role in the develop- 



ment of my life, whether 
emotionall), financially or 
both. 

Some of my earliest child- 
hood memories are of her 
either taking me to 
preschool, fixing me lunch 
on her days off or taking 
me shopping for school 
clothes ■ because I had 
either worn out my old 
ones or outgrown them 
altogether, 
lalso recall her yelling at me 
from time to time fordoing things 
wrong as well as praising me for 
doing things right 

She would work extra at the 
hospital because I needed braces 
or simply because she wanted to 
spend a Ei tele extra on me, my 
brother and my sister, always sac- 
rificing her needs over ours. 

She became to me what a 
prime example of a mother 
should be, just by being herself. 

My father was just as good a 
parent as my mother was while 
we were growing up. 

He worked as hard as he 
could to gel as far as he could In 
order to help raise us with a lot of 
the benefits his family couldn't 
afford while growing up, eventu- 
ally making it to the top of his 
rompany-not so much because he 
loved the work, but because he 
loved his family. 

He was always present at our 
different functions, even coaching 
me in Little League (although I 
spent a lot of my time on the 
bench) and in soccer. 

He became involved in the 
Optimist Club, an organization 
designed to benefit children, and 
served with high distinction with- 
in the Indiana organization. 

Beside all of his material 
advancements, however, what I 
remember about my father that I 
respect the most is the fact that 
he tried his best to give his chil- 
dren a good, strong relationship 
with their parents through sler- 
ness and support. 

He managed to forget about 
how he was raised long enough to 
remember that he wasn't the one 
being raised anymore-he was 
doing the raising. 

My father always told us 
when we were wrong and com- 
mended us for being right (as rare 
as that was) and always taught us 
that the best way to live was with 
compassion and rationale. 

Good parents can be very 
hard to come by in this day and 
age, and I lament this more than 
anything in the world. Good par- 
ents that are good people are 
even harder to come by. 

1 consider myself very lucky 
to know two people that fulfill 
both of these standards and thank 
god they're both my parents. 
Happy Father's Day, Pops. 



Supply and Demand 



by Darci L. Denton, Staff Writer 



Well, he's finally done it. 

Thanks to President Clinton, 
movie theaters across the country 
have promised to card young people 
who enter their establishments and 
purchase tickets for "R" rated movies. 

From now on, theater employees 
will assume the responsibility of see- 
ing to it that no one under seventeen 
years of age, unless accompanied by 
an adult, gets in to see these "flicks." 

Another point scored for passing 
the buck. 

Not counting fake I.D.'s, there is 
much room for lax or even non-com- 
pliance with such a "promise." 

Mr. Clinton himself has shown, 
on more than one occasion, just how 
to get around promises. 

I don't know about the rest of 
you, but I have a little trouble taking 
moral advice from a man who has 
shown the world his lack of concern 
for the emotional welfare of his own 
family. 

The recent "crisis" in Kosovo has 
not erased the memory of how I felt 
when I watched him on television 
attempting to redefine the word "is." 

I'm hoping theater owners and 
employees alike are better able than 
the president was at holding on to 
their scruples and facing up to the 
collective responsibility we all have to 
the young people in this country. 

Descending from my soapbox, I'd 
like to get to another equally, if not 
more important, point of the matter. 

Just for a moment, let's think 
about the mental and emotional 
development of a person. 

Haven't the social sciences 
proven, through decades of research, 
that a person's environment is as 
important as his heredity? 

If you believe this, and I believe 
that most of you do, how can we 
ignore the fact that we are not direct- 
ing our attention toward the influ- 
ences kids are surrounded by before 
they turn 17? 

By the time a person is 17 or 18 
his personality, for the most part, has 
already had the foundation laid. 

Sure, we modify, we grow, we 
change our minds about things as we 
grow older, but our most basic atti- 



tudes and the way we feel about the 
value of life have already been 
formed. 

For the President to think that he 
can fool us into believing that this 
new promise is going to be a solution 
to the teen violence in this country' is 
ludicrous. 

For us to be fooled would be even 
more ludicrous. 

When children are small, the) are 
like putty in our hands. 

If you've ever known a child who 
did not imitate the adults in his or her 
environment, you haven't paid close 
enough attention. 

Who and what kids grow into is 
determined, to a great extent, by 
things that they've seen us do and 
everything they've been exposed to. 

Later in life, if they're lucky 
enough to get to later, they have the 
chance to change some of who and 
what they are. 

It's their school years and maj be 
the first 10 or so years after school 
that they are sort of free-falling emo- 
tionally, somehow arriving at one 
place after another without really 
knowing how they got there. 

What I'm trying to say is that kids 
aren't born aggressive and in search 
of violence; our societ) knows now 
that these things are learned. 

Parents aren't the only ones to be 
held accountable, but they are the 
first ones to really influence the kids 
and so it must begin with them. 

If the movie and video industries 
are more concerned with profits than 
with the welfare of our children, we 
have no choice than to take steps to 
help them change their minds. 

If we don't rent or buy the vio- 
lent movies and games, stop going to 
the theater and refrain from buying 
any of the t-shirts, posters and other 
junk, we get their attention. 

It's all about supply and demand, 
folks. If we don't demand It, they have 
no reason to supply it 

We can sit here and pass the 
buck about responsibility all day long, 
but if things are going to change, it 
has to be "we the people" who change 
them. 

I realize that most kids don't end 



up killing people just because the\ 
play violent video games and watch 
violent movies. 

Murder, though, is not the only 
possible undesirable result of these 
greed), despicable industries. 

Look around you and you will see 
all kinds of violence and aggression 
among our young people today . 

By allowing, and even promoting, 
the business of violence (through buy- 
ing, renting and viewing), we as adults 
have signed, sealed and delivered our 
letter of acceptance to the industries 
thai are slowly taking our children 
away from us. 

Let's remember also that there 
are kids out there who have emotional 
problems and are able to rent and 
watch this stuff. 

I don't know about you. but I'm 
not willing to gamble with our kids 
that waj . 

I'm not willing to trust Lady Luck. 

Ever) thing today seems to me to 
be moving way too fast. 

Breakfast is fast, lunch is fast and 
dinner is fast. 

We drive fast, we play fast and 
then we sleep fast. 

Then what happens? 

More of the same, only after a 
while it won't seem fast enough and 
we'll have to go faster. 

Movies won't seem violent 
enough and we'll have to expose our- 
selves to even more violence in order 
to experience the same sensations the 
old level of violence used to give us. 

Let's not allow this to happen to 
us. 

Let's admit our liability, take 
responsibility and use our sensibility. 

The movie and video industries 
weren't content with the mammoth 
profits they were making before; now 
they think the First Amendment 
should protect them after they've 
irresponsibly fed our youth the drug 
of violence for the sake of profits. 

This has gone on for long 
enough. I've had enough, have you?

Evil overshadows crass 'Powers' 



by Ben Freese 
Guesl Writer 



In the new film "Austin 
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged 
Me," we anxiously awaited all 
the antics of Austin's arch 
enemy, Dr. Evil, instead oT Joy- 
Fully anticipating each shot of 
the title's shagadelic hero. 

All Austin wants to talk 
about is his sexual prowess or 
scream "yeah, baby" until our 
collective ears are ringing. 
Dr. Evil is much more satisfy- 
ing with his goof) penchant 
for the absurd and his little 
band of merry screw-ups. 

In fact, that's the main 
problem with the new Austin 
Powers movie and its good 
guy: Too much mojo and not 
enough of the silly uncertain- 
ty which permeated the first 
film. 

The audience ends 
up enjoying the 
unorthodox bad 
guj 's willingne: 
to humiliate 
himself 
than the 



main character's exploits and 
patiently waits through 
Austin's semi-fun scenes just 
to get to the good doctor's (or 
bad, actually) fine scenes of 
comedic exuberance. 

This is not to sa&gt; that the 
film isn't funny. On the con- 
trary, it has a lot of scenes 
that are downright knee-slap- 
pingly hilarious. 

I'm simply pointing out 
the fact that Evil has more of 
these scenes and also more 
chances to be funny. 

Austin just gets to 
become single, 
very quickly 
obtain 




then pretty much retires to 
his usual shiick that we're 
already familiar with from the 
first movie. 

Dr. Evil, on the other 
hand, winds up with a whole 
new entourage of funny char- 
acters and old ones from the 
first film that are used to their 
full comedic advantage. These 
characters are all given a 
chance to take their respective 
talents and put them to use in 
a new and often funny 
manner. 

Mike Myers, as Austin 
Powers, is given the chance to 
be, well, the same old Austin, 
juiced up with the ability to 
be more crass and unlovable 
than he ever was in the first 

With so much of Austin's 
crude jokes and sight gags, it 
easy to see that this 
equel was greatly influ- 
enced by the ■'new" style 
■of gross-out humor that 
There's Something 
About Mary" made popular 
ast year. 

That film's huge success 

has convinced Hollywood that 

this kind of humor is the only 

thing that will work with 

iday's audience (and that 

film was very 

V, but 

tyle only 

for cer- 

Ims, not 

every film). 

Consequently, 

film's director, 

Roach (also

nt with that

naking 



rather than draw- 

ng from what made

'ith a good career. 



Powers: International Man of 
Mystery." so funny. 

My feeling is that was an 
enormous mistake, but, then 
again, movie sequels aren't 
usually ever as good as the 
originals (excluding "Aliens," 
"T2" and "Die Hard," of 
course). 

Regardless of the "bath- 
room humor" that the Austin 
Powers scenes have, this 
movie has other potential 
problems. 

First of all, the opening 
sequence isn't really all that 
funny. 

It is funny that Austin is 
running around naked, but 
the original's opening 
sequence was just more mem- 
orable and, more importantly, 
more fresh and original. 

That's another problem: 
the movie gives us Austin as 
usual and the joke is done. 

It doesn't help matters 
that his sexy new girlfriend, 
Heather Graham, is nothing 
more than eye candy for 
hornj young males, instead of 
being a charismatic counter- 
part for old "AP." 

Elizabeth Hurley, his 
mate in the first film, is sorely 
missed here and her fate at 
the film's beginning is quite 
disappointing, not to mention 
downright stupid. 

The best parts of the film 
belong solely to Dr. Evil and 
Co. (although there is a really 
funny running gag involving a 
spacecraft shaped like geni- 
talia and its subsequent reac- 
tions from onlookers). 

The film begins with Dr. 
Evil's son on "Jerry Springer" 
and that scene is a hilarious 
set-up for the continuous feud 
between father and son that 
runs the length of the movie. 

To complicate matters, 



Dr. Evil has a miniature clone 
of himself made named Mini- 
Me as a way to show his son, 
Scott Evil (once again a very 
funny portrayal by Seth 
Green) that he's been 
replaced. 

Not only is Mini-Me the 
best part of the movie, but 
every scene between him and 
Dr. Evil is a comedy delight. In 
fact, I think the scene where 
Dr. Evil and Mini-Me perform 
a rap version oF the song "Just 
the Two oF Us" is one oF the 
Funniest things I've ever seen 
in my entire life. 

Also bringing the comedy- 
out to the audience in a big 
way are the characters of Frau 
Fabisinau and Number 2. 

There is a hilarious scene 
in which Dr. Evil steals 
Austin's mojo and goes after 
Frau in a loving way and the 
gimmick of using Rob Lowe to 
impersonate a young Number 
2 (the original film's character 
played by Robert Wagner, 
appearing briefly here in a 
cameo) is priceless. 

Another character (por- 
trayed by Mike Myers), Fat 
Bastard, also has some funny 
scenes, like a scene so sick it 
makes one want to vomit all 
over where Fat Bastard is in 
the buff. 

Mike Myers is a very 



funny comedian and he made 
me laugh in the original movie 
when he played a simple man 
known as Austin Powers who 
was a Fish out of water in a 
society that rejected him. 

In this film, Austin travels 
back in time to the 1960s and 
his character's whole reason 
to be funny ceases to exist. 

It's just too bad that 
Austin himself couldn't have 
been as funny as the bad guy. 
Dr. Evil (who Mike Myers also 
portrays) and all of the sup- 
porting characters in this film, 
but that's how he comes off 
for the most part. 

Still, though, the movie 
has its moments and delivers 
to anyone who likes to laugh. 
Rating: ** 1/2 (out of 
four).

Entertainment legend dazzles Coliseum audience 




Legendary performer Elton John played the Coliseum Tuesday, June 8. 



by Jasen 
Staff Writer 



Just when you (nought I 
could only write about loud, 
obnoxious, kooky rock shows, 
yours truly hits you over the 
head with none other than 
that ol' keymaster himself (no, 
not Liberate), Elton John. 

For those of you who are 
just now emerging from under 
your rocks or out of your 
sugar comas, Elton John 
played the Memorial Coliseum 
on Tuesday, June 8. 

Let me tell ya, folks, this 
was almost unreal for me. I 
have been pretty familiar with 
Elton's music since I was a lit- 
tle kid. 

My mom was really into 
him, and 1 remember theradio 
bursting at the "seams "with his 
songs in the latter part of the 
70s. 

So when 1 was taking pic- 
tures of him during the first 
two numbers, it was a bit awe- 
inspiring to be that close to 
someone who has accom- 
plished so much in music. 

Nonetheless, I was able to 
contain my excitement and 
deal with the task of getting 
the photos I had come for. 

This was unbelievably 
easier than I was used to, 
when shooting at shows. As 



you know from my past arti- 
cles (if you read The 
Communicator on a regular 
basis like you should, or at 
least my stuff), I usually go to 
harder rock shows of mostly 
current bands. 

In those cases, every fan 
is considered guilty until off 
the property, so security mea- 
sures are heightened, to say 
the least. 

This show, however, was 
almost a complete 180 com- 
pared to the others. There was 
no need for iron bars to be 
slapped up in front of the 
stage with statues from Easter 
Island standing every three 
feet. 

Since it was a fairly older 
crowd (older than me at least), 
there were assigned seats on 
the floor a.ndj no ,-bar.riers 
between Elton and his fans. 

Although, when he first 
took the stage, a few anxious 
Eltonites did rush up to the 
edge brandishing point-and- 
shoot cameras as well as flow- 
ers to present to Sir Reginald. 

They were up there 
crowding around for one song, 
though, and were not too dis- 
tracting. 

1 was able to work around 
them while Elton sat alone at 
his piano in the left part of the 
stage, singing his classic 
melodies. 




Elton mesmerizes the crowd with another one of his captivating perfor- 
mances. 



1 was allowed to shoot the 
first two numbers, as were the 
other photographers, and then 
had to put the camera away. 

No matter, though; I man- 
aged to squeeze off four rolls 
in my allotted time. 

After the first two were 
finished, there was no doubt 
about what I would do next. 

I went and found my seat 
and watched the rest of the 
show. 

In some cases, I will shoot 
what 1 have to and then exit 
the arena. As it turns out, 1 
made the right decision in 
staying. 

During the course of the 
nearly three hour show, Elton 
played many of the songs I 
had come to see such as 
"Daniel," "Take Me to the 
Pilot,"/ ''iipriky Cat," "Levon,"| 
as well as many others inciud-J 
ing a rousing version of 
"Crocodile Rock," 

The set was generously 
peppered with newer, slower I 
songs, many of which I was 
familiar with from VH-1 and 
adult contemporary radio (1 
hear it in offices all the timi 

It was classic Elton I had I 
hoped for, though, and that's 
what 1 got. 

There were many songs 
wanted to hear, such as | 
"Madman Across the Water" 
and "Philadelphia Freedom," 
but if he were to do every- 
thing that people wanted to 
hear, I would probably stilt 
be there now. 

A couple of days prior to 
viewing Elton perform the 
classic tunes he did, I 
received two tickets from the 
promotions company, so I 
was faced with the task of | 
deciding who would accom- 
pany me to this event. 

1 had hoped a certain lady 
friend of mine, but unfortu- 
nately she had to work. 

So at the last minute 
haste before the concert, 1 
told my roommate that if he i 
wanted to go, the ticket was 
his. 

Being no fool (at least 
most of the time), he went 
with me to see the legend 
perform. 

We got great seats, about 
nine rows back from the 
stage, with a good view of 
Elton onstage as well as on 
the two huge screens that 
were showing him from dif- 
ferent angles. 

During the show, my 
friend said to me "Man, this 
is like being at a VH-1 
Storytellers!" 

As I said, we were sitting 
in row nine and we were two 
seats in from the aisle. 

Next to us, on the aisle, 
were a couple that perfectly 
exemplified the fact that 
some women will settle for 
anything. 

This couple was about 
mid-30s, yuppyish and as 
different as night and day 
toward their attitude toward 
the musician onstage. , 

The attractive blonde 1 
woman was completely 
enthralled by the songs and 
showed genuine appreciation 
to be there. 

Her man, on the other 
hand, looked as if he were in 
the lobby of a dentist's office.

This guy had the typical 
macho "I'm too cool for every- 
thing" expression of boredom 
on his mug and looked as 
though he would rather be 
hearing whatever was playing 
over the loudspeaker at 
Hooters. 

I was astounded when he 
actually fell asleep in the mid- 
dle of the show. 

My roommate and I made 
it a point to get up to get beer 
and go to the bathroom as 
much as we could, seeing as 
how this guy had to move 
from his slouched position 
whenever we wanted to exit 
our seats. 

Apart from seeing the 
show, our secondary mission 
was to make this uncultured 
Neanderthal even more 
uncqfrnfjbr^ajble/ . than .he 



already was. 

This cat would probably 
have gotten bored If John 
Lennon rose from the grave 
and gave a musical disserta- 
tion on the meaning of life. 

The show was top notch, 
in my opinion, despite that 
cretin's attitude. 

There were in fact only 
two things that made me stop 
and take notice in my usual, 
critical manner. 

One was the fact that 
Elton was not hitting his trade- 
mark high notes in the songs. 

When it came time in 
"Pilot" for the "na-na-na" part, 
it was in a lower key. 

This did not bother me, 
though, for 1 realized that the 
man is getting older, and after 
years and years of touring (as 
well as some drug and alcohol 
problems), he wouldn't be 
singing in the shower anymore 
if he still tried to hit way up 
there. 

The manner in which he 
handled it though came off 
very well, and the loud audi- 
ence supplied many of the 
high octaves when they sang 
along. 

The other thing I noticed 
was that Elton seems to have 
some sort of affiliation with 
Diet Coke. 

Many times during the 
course of the show, he would 
reach down next to his piano 
and pull up a can with the 
label constantly facing the 
crowd. 

I know he did 
commercial for 
them a 



Besides, 1 have a theory 
that if it is a deal with the 
Coke people, it is not necessar- 
ily Diet Coke in the can, but 
something like mineral water 
instead. 

1 know from my own 
singing days that soda pop is 
one of the worst things for 
your voice when singing. 

(By the way, if you like 
that conspiracy theory, wait 
'till you hear my ideas on The 
Illuminati, The United Nations 
and Ricky Martin.) 

These things did little, if 
anything, to detract from the 
show as a whole, though, and I 
was quite satisfied with the 
first legend I have gotten to 
photograph. 

I'm still amazed over a 
star of that magnitude coming 
to see Fort Where(?) Indianer, 
but I'm happy it worked out. 

So, at this point, I will be 
signing off from another 
broadcast day and be bidding 
you all a fond farewell. 

Oh, and just so none of 
you out there think I'm getting 
soft by covering a show such 
as this, let me tell you that I 
am currently trying to obtain 
an Insane Clown Posse pass, so 
hopefully 1 will be back sodn 
with news of more music «T 
frighten your children (or par- 
ents) with in the future. 

So long for now.

Career in Review: 
Cypress Hill remains on 
cutting edge of rap industry 



by Adam Taylor, 
Edilor 

If an artist is measured 
purely by the amount of 
attention they get from the 
media and public, Columbia 
Records' artist Cypress Hill 
may not be quite as successful 
as the Marilyn Mansons or the 
Elton Johns of the music 
Industry. 

However, as far as sound 
quality goes, it is the opinion 
of this writer that they could 
hold their own against either 
of the two. 

Since their first album 
came out in 1991, Cypress 
Hill has had a love/hate rela- 
tionship with the general pub- 
lic. 

This has not hindered the 
group when it comes to 
putting out new and more 
improved albums since their 
debut, however. 

Beginning with their self- 
tided album in 1991, Cypress 
Hill has caught the ears of Hip 
Hop listeners with such tracks 
as "Pigs" and their famous 
"Hand on the Pump," a classic 
party favorite from the early 
90s. 

Their debut success was 
soon followed by the media 
hit "Black Sunday," harboring 
such tunes as "1 Wanna Get 
High," "Hits From the Bong," 
"A to the K" and "Insane in 
the Brain"; the song that 
brought them to the limelight 
In the first place. 

Following the success of 
"Black Sunday," Cypress took 
a couple years off from the 
recording studio to tour and 
enjoy the success they had 
gained from their first two 
albums. 

During this time, differ- 
ent sampling techniques were 
experimented with that 
Cypress would use on their 
third album. 

When finally released in 
1995, "Cypress Hill HI 
(Temple of Boom)" became an 
instant success, though not 
quite as successful with the 
popular media as "Black 
Sunday" had been for them. 

1 personally enjoyed this 
album quite a bit more than 
the other two they had previ- 
ously released, though, due 
mostly in part to the mellow 
rhythms found in such songs 
as "Spark Another Owl" and 



"Strictly Hip Hop," although I 
must confess I don't really 
agree with the content of the 
lyrics. 

I guess this proves to me 
that a song can be good with- 
out the lyrics having any per- 
sonal meaning. 

In the year following 
their third album, Cypress Hill 
got together with other rap- 
pers from the music industry 
for a sort of compilation 
album. 

The album "Cypress Hill: 
Unreleased and Revamped" 
featured the remixing skills of 
such rap industry legends as 
the Fugees, Call Da Wild 
and Diamond D, former House 
of Pain member. 

Not only did this album 
include remixes of such past 
hits as "Boom Biddy Bye Bye" 
and "Illusions" but also previ- 
ously unreleased songs such 
as "Whatta You Know." 

The song "Throw Your 
Hands in the Air" has to be 
one of my favorite previously 
unreleased songs on this 
album full of remixes. 

It starts out with a nice, 
steady tempo from Soul 
Assassins when seemingly out 
of nowhere a Cypress Hill 
baseline and the fast rapping 
style of Cypress Hill frontman 
B. Real enters the song. 

The two groups collabo- 
rate for the remainder of the 
song, a song that calls for 
unity through musical harmo- 
ny and the common interest 
of everyone having a good 
time. 

Another song that 1 
enjoyed quite a bit from 
"Unreleased and Revamped" 
was the remix of "Boom Biddy 
Bye Bye" featuring the Fugees. 

Although 1 found the 
original version of the song 
better, 1 was glad to see the 
Fugees collaborating with 
Cypress Hill because I am a 
very big fan of both groups. 

Some of the lyrics I felt 
didn't make much sense but I 
guess you do what you have 
to do to get the song done. It 
was a good song overall. 

I'd also like to add that 
Diamond D did an excellent 
job on his remix of "When the 
Ship Goes Down," reminiscent 
of his work on House of Pain's 
"Same As It Ever Was." 

With the breakup of 
House of Pain a week follow- 
ing the release of their album 



"Truth Crushed to the Earth 
Will Rise Again," I began to 
wonder if some of the other 
supposed "one-hit wonders" 
from the rap industry' in the 
early 90s would follow 
suit-particularly Cypress Hill. 

This was a big concern of 
mine since the history of their 
music careers were nearly 
identical. 

All fears of Cypress Hill 
breaking up were put to rest, 
though, with the release of 
their latest album, "Cypress 
Hill IV," in 1998. 

Not only was I relieved 
that the band had not broken 
up, 1 was relieved that they 
could not only produce songs 
as good as they used to but in 
some cases better ones. 

Those songs worthy of 
mention include "From the 
Window of my Room," 
"Tequila Sunrise," "16 Men 
Till There's No Men Left" and 
"Clash of the Titans." 

"Tequila Sunrise" was an 
interesting song, as it had a 
very Latin influence In the 
instrumentals. 

As far as I can recall, this 
is very rare for Cypress Hill to 
do, although the band does 
have a Latin background. 

The Incorporation of the 
guitar and horns add a great 
deal to a well-composed and 
seemingly well thought out 
song. 

It has become a very pop- 
ular viewpoint in our society 
that bands that leave the 
mainstream listening audi- 
ence do so because they stop 
making albums worthy of the 
attention of the masses. 

In the case of Cypress 
Hill, however, this is not the 
case. They may have lost sup- 
port due to their references to 
using marijuana, their violent 
subject matter or the coarse- 
ness of their lyrics-all factors 
that would prohibit DJs from 
playing their music over the 
air waves. 

That doesn't reflect the 
quality of their work, though, 
In my opinion, as I feel good 
rhythm and instrumental 
implementation is also worthy 
of note. 

Cypress Hill has come a 
long way since the days of 
their mainstream media atten- 
tion and I believe they're not 
through making good albums 
by a long shot.

Classics Summer Theatre 
take you back to that time 
of innocence with their 
delightful musical "Dames 
at Sea." 

Based on the nostalgia 
of the Hollywood musicals 
of the 1930s, this musical 
takes you to the bright 
lights of New York City 
where a songwriting sailor 
and a lyrical lass team up 
to make It big in the enter- 
tainment circuit. Add a 
love triangle conflict, a 
giant battleship and a zany 
cast of characters and you have "Dames at 
Sea." 

Performances for July 9, 10, 15, 16 and 17 
are at 8 p.m. and performances for July 1 1 and 





18 are at 2:30 p.m. All shows are at 
Williams Theatre. 

This performance is a 
revival of the IPFW depart- 
ment of theatre's 1973 
award-winning production 
that was one of six chosen 
from colleges throughout 
the country to appear at 
the Kennedy Center in 
Washington, D. C. 

Don't miss out on all 
the exciting opportunities, 
arranged to make this show 
exciting. IPFW alumni can 
enjoy Dinner on the 
Riverboat. On opening 
night, go to Headwaters 
Park for an evening of food 
and theatre. After dining 
on the riverboat, take a drive to Williams 
Theatre and enjoy the show. If you are not 
alumni, don't worry. Bill's Bistro will be host- 
ing dinner for every evening performance with 
the exception of July 15. Still not enough for 
you? Well, we have more. Opening night is 
Navy Night. That's right, all navy veterans who 
can fit into their uniform (or part of it) will be 
admitted free into the performance.

Summer training vital in athletic success 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 



It is one of the most 
overused sports phrases in 
history-summer practice 
shows season performance. 

That phrase is as close 
to the truth as anything in 
college athletics, however. 

Whether it's tennis, 
cross country, basketball or 
baseball, (he extra step in 
training during the summer 
will always show through in 
the regular season. 

IPFW freshmen soon 



•*. 




realize exactly what that 
extra step is while train- 
ing during their first 
summer. 

IPFW sophomore 
Paul Trahin remembers 
how soon he realized it. 
"When I came here 1 
thought that I would jusi 
be able to continue doing 
what I was doing in high 
school," Trahin says. 
"However, there is a big dif- school." 
ference when it comes to Sophomore tennis play- 

college running. You have to er David Wade puts across 
be more disciplined, more the same recollection as 
open, and more committed Trahin. 
to your sport than in high "In high school I didn't 

have to work at it as much," 
Wade says. "Coach Horton 
puts a lot of emphasis on 
the weight room and that 
has been something that I 
am trying to make a con- 
scious effort towards." 

Both athletes know how 
important working out in 
the summer can be and both 
want to improve to be able 
to produce the best results 
for themselves and IPFW.

Ain't too 

proud to 

beg... 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 

It hasn't been real easy 
being a Hoosier in the last cou- 
ple of weeks. First the Indy 
500, which used to be the num- 
ber one event in sports, wasn't 
even the greatest spectacle in 
Indianapolis with the Pacers 
opening up against the New 
York Knicks. That game didn't 
even turn out well as the Knicks 
stole game one and eventually 
ended up taking the series away 
from the Pacers. 

Now news that Indiana 
University basketball coach, 
Bob Knight could be charged 
with assault and battery has 
added to what was already a 
real struggle for me. 

I had the privilege of being 
at the 500 this year. It was fun, 
but unfortunately it really has 
gone downhill thanks to Tony 
George and his Indy Racing 
League. 

Secondly, the Indiana 
Pacers-a number one seed in 
the East-squaring off against 
one of its biggest rivalries, the 



New York Knicks, came up 
short. The last time I saw some- 
one choke as bad as Reggie 
Miller did in that series was 
when Latrell Spreewell had his 
hands around the neck of P.J. 
Carlisemo. That loss hurt 
bad-real bad. The pain from 
the Pacers' loss soon went away, 
though, as the story broke out 
that Indiana basketball coach 
Bob Knight had assaulted a 
patron at restaurant. 

Knight went out to eat with 
his wife and her two sisters 
when a gentleman started ask- 
ing him why he was making 
racist remarks. Knight denied 
making the remarks and asked 
to be left alone. The patron who 



offered the unsolicited advice 
allegedly found himself pinned 
against the wall, held up only 
by the fist of Bobby Knight. 

The interesting thing about 
this case is that both men could 
be charged with misdemeanors. 

At press time, however, it 
appeared that all charges would 
be dropped. 

It's been a rough week to 
be a Hoosier, let me tell you, 
but there's a light at the end of" 
the tunnel. With so many great 
sporting events coming up such 
as the NBA Draft, Stanley Cup 
Finals, NBA Finals, and the 
College World Series, I hope 
that I will be able to enjoy the 
sporting scene once again!
