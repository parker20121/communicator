The chancellor's office, Wartell 
said, will concentrate on filling the 
current senior-level administrative 
positions: vice-chancellor of 
Academic Affairs and the newly 
created position of executive direc- 
tor of Institutional advancement. 

There have also been several 
administrative changes such as the 
development of the university 
council and the office of university 
advancement. 

Wartcll talked about his goal to 
develop the image of IPFW in the 
Fort Wayne community. Tie staled

Indiana students can tune-in to T.V. college 



ByKristieRiccISchlundt 
Editor In Chief 

IPFW students now have another 
way to access higher learning: 

Indiana colleges and universi- 
ties, including IPFW, are cooperat- 
ing to provide transferable, basic 
education courses to Indiana resi- 
dents. The participating universities 
are: 

♦ Ball Slate University 

♦ Independent Colleges of 

Indiana 

♦ Indiana State University 



♦ Indiana University 

♦ Ivy Tech Stale College 

♦ Purdue University 

♦ University of Southern 

Indiana 

♦ Vinccnnes University 

IPFW Interim Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs Fred Kirchhoff 
said that the program has been 
under development for several 
years. 

"The complaints of 
Southeastern Indiana residents were 
the driving force behind this pro- 
gram." he commented

Residents of Southeastern 
Indiana, Kirchhoff explained, had 
tilde or no access to higher educa- 
tion. But (he Indiana College 
Network, he said, attempts to 
address that problem. 

While Kirchhoff noted that the 
system has the potential to reach 
many no n traditional students, such 
as students with disabilities or stu- 
dents with small children, there are 
problems with the system, he said. 

"For students who are not moti- 
vated, this would not provide a 
good alternative to the traditional 
classroom. The program doesn't 
offer the structure of a classroom 
environment, and there is a much 
higher likelihood that the student 
will be distracted in the home envi- 



IPFW Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Frank Borelli said 
the Indiana Commission for Higher 
Education maintains thai the new 
program will increase enrollment 
in the tri-siate area 

"The estimates are optimistic, 
and I'm really not sure what data 
they used. I'm not so sure that die 
program will appreciably effect 
enrollment," Borelli stated. 

"We're already very accessible 
to the area," Borelli added.

Turn-lane closure reroutes 
vehicle traffic entering campus 



By F. Lane Douse 
News Editor 

Effective Augusl 18, ihe easl- 
bound Coliseum Boulevard 
enirance lo campus was closed, 
which may cause IPFW students lo 
change their driving routines. 

According to Don Kattcr. direc- 
tor of ihe physical plant, the lefl 
turn on ihe wesi campus drive 
fromColiseum Boulevardlane was 
closed because of potential driving 
hazards. 

"For safely reasons, ihe left-lum 
lane was shut down. After several 
cars filled the lane, others would 
protrude into the other lane, creat- 
ing one lane," said Kallcr. 

Kaucr also staled that, because 
of this driving hazard, there has 
been some rear-end collisions, 
property damage, and personal 
damages. 

There are some advantages with 
Ihe shutdown of the turn lane: 
IPFW students can now make a lefl 
turn onio Coliseum Boulevard, 
which was formerly illegal. 

The Ciiy also created a dual left- 
lum lane ai the Coliseum-Crescent 
(Slate Road 37) intersection. 

"Instead of wailing for five or 
six lighl changes, students can 
make (wo lefts and are on campus," 
Kailer said. "It's an alternative 
route that is faster and safer for our 
sludenls." 

The route Katicr refers (o is the 
dual turn from Crescent onto 




IPFW iludents line up at the four-way stop at the La wshe-Broyks 

intersection.

Lawshe Drive {the entrance in front 
of the Walb Memorial Union circle 
drive). 

Katter acknowledged thai there 
arc some problems associated with 
ihe one-year-old Broyles and 
Lawshe intersection, such as the 
two stop signs that often go unno- 



ticed by campus drivers. 

"We have not deemed it neces- 
sary yet to pul in a slop light ai 
the two stop signs out of Walb," 
Katier commented. "We will 
monitor the situation, especially 
if the traffic in thai area progress- 
es," Kattcr added. 




The lefl turn lane from eastbound Coliseum Boulevard onto the IPFW campus has been closed 

since Aug. 18.

Career development workshops to be offered 



By F. Lane Douse 
News Editor 

Ever have the feeling that your 
family becomes work and school 
becomes family? 

"How to Juggle, Work, Family 
and School" is the first of a series of 
workshops starting Sept. 12, at 
noon in Walb Union G21. 

This workshop series is conduct- 
ed by Linda Taylor, career coun- 



selor and academic advisor of 
Student Academic Counseling 
Services, who will give students 
survival dps 

"The majority of our students are 
non-traditional students, which 
mean they may have families, jobs 
and school to deal with at any one 
time." Taylor said. 
"There are also the traditional stu- 
dents who may live ai home and 
have to juggle school, family and 



their social life. It's difficult to do," 
she added. 

"Time management is the key to 
success in terms of getting a 
degree," said Linda Johnson, direc- 
tor for the Center for Women and 
Reluming Adults 

Johnson added that a successful 
person is not just a person who does 
everything right, but a person who 
can identify the priorities in bis or 
her life — then act upon them. 



Administrative reorganization 

Chancellor creates university advancement department 



By F. Lane Douse 
News Editor 

During the past week. Chancellor 
Michael Wartell announced several 
administrative changes. 

"In terms of administration struc- 
ture, there has been a moderate reor- 
ganization in the chancellor's staff 
which reflects my desire to put 
more emphasis on development and 
ihe development of IPFWs image," 
said Wartell. 

The reorganization Wartell refers 
to is the formation of the university 



advancement department. This 
department will be headed by the 
executive director of institution 
advancement a newly-created posi- 
tion. 

The university advancement 
department will consist of 
University Relations. Development 
and the Alumni Affairs offices. The 
News Bureau and Cable Channel 6 
will continue lo operate under the 
university relations area, whereas 
Publications will now be combined 
with Printing Services. 

The executive director of institu- 



tion advancement wdl supervise all 
departments, acting as a liaison to 
the administration. 

According to Judy Clinton, 
director of University Relations, this 
reorganization is fairly typical in 
most universities. 

"Previous chancellors functioned 
in that role," Clinton commented. 
"Chancellor Wartell felt ihai this 
function is important enough., .that it 
needs 10 be a separate function from 
the chancellor." 

The executive director will report 
directly to the chancellor. 



Clinton stated that University 
Relations will be putting more 
"emphasis on the news area." 

Leonard P. Iaquinta. director of 
development believes (hat the for- 
mation of this committee is "a posi- 
tive step in the maturation of the 
campus." 

"I think it's an extraordinarily 
good idea." Iaquinta said. "It's com- 
mon for a university to have an inte- 
grated advancement team." 

The search for Ihe executive 
director is tentatively scheduled to 
begin in early fall.

Faculty Forum 

Dean of fine arts calls 
for liberality in the arts 



By Gerald Let RatllfT 

Dean of lb* School of Fine and 

Performing Arts 

Any representative portrait of the 
fine and performing arts in a tradi- 
tional urn . ■■( ii ■, setting must include 
a basic understanding of the role that 
'liberal arts' plays in giving sub- 
stance and purpose to modem art 
and to modem society. Inherent to 
the initial and subsequent academic 
and professional (raining of young 
artists should be an educational 
foundation (hat permits students to 
view their historical past and to pro- 
vide diverse instructional models 
that frame daily experiences in artis- 
tic objeclificalion; and to self- 
expression that speaks in both time 
and space. 

This is the 'liberality' in the arts 
that needs to be explored not only on 
our own campus but also in the larg- 
er context of the academic commu- 
nity- at -large. In seeking to cultivate 
and to foster fine and performing 
arts programs of exceptional acade- 
mic and professional promise, it is 
essential to speak directly to the 
need for faculty to become self-con- 
scious educators whose academic 
and artistic standards constitute a 
full-time commitment to their disci- 
plines and 10 their students; and for 
students to engage in intensive, 
introspective career training that 
promotes and recognizes non- tradi- 
tional approaches to learning. 

As a regional university with an 
arts mission to serve as a cultural 
center of influence for northeastern 
Indiana, we have an implicit obliga- 
tion to the campus and to the com- 
munity to recognize the many voices 
and the many cultures that sustain 
arts education and help to demon- 
strate the universality of arts expres- 
sion, especially in our multi-cultural 



society today. It is also important to 
acknowledge the fact that we in the 
university are teachers, first, last, 
and always. We arc not in the 
'show' business, with its fundamen- 
tal emphasis upon disguise and 
deceit at the true expense of genuine 
knowledge and understanding; and 
we arc not 'master artists' in pursuit 
of paid commissions, performance 
honoraria, or consultant fees. 

The simple fact that we arc in the 
'education' business demands that 
we place students — rather than our 
own sclf-intercst(s) — at the center of 
the academic and artistic learning 
experience and that wc as university 
arts faculty and administrators return 
almost immediately to the basics of 
teaching: providing a solid liberal 
arts foundation from which teacher- 
anist-scbolars of the future can go 
forth to create better social worlds, 
or 10 image more creative vistas rich 
in scope and dimension. With the 
return to 'liberality' in the fine and 
performing arts, it is surely possible 
to forge those cultural partnerships 
which are truly academic and artis- 
tic. 

The academic and professional 
training of artists demands integrity 
in the choice of courses to be taught, 
in which they will be taught. It is 
also important to promote 'artistic' 
internships, in which talented stu- 
dents compete for apprenticeships 
with truly gifted master artists; that 
'experiential' approaches to artistic 
instruction be provided so that the 
student artist have an opportunity for 
in-service and applied learning 
opportunities; and that 'team teach- 
ing' approaches to studio instruction 
include both an artist and an acade- 
mician who would share responsibil- 
ity for cultivating artistic skill and 
intellectual inquiry. 

Any subsequent discussion of the 



arts in a traditional university setting 
must include ample opportunities 
for all students to participate in cre- 
ative expression and to be afforded 
easy access to those studio courses, 
performances, concerts or public 
exhibitions that might serve to edu- 
cate their appreciation of the arts or 
to stimulate their active participa- 
tion in the arts. And could we afford 
to ask for less in our role as educa- 
tors than insist that arts program- 
ming, campus and community activ- 
ities, or outreach projects directly 
related to the arts begin to address 
the needs of our audience in terms 
of cultivating challenging educa- 
tional perspectives, providing alter- 
native intellectual commentary or 
promoting interdisciplinary 
approaches to enrich applied forms 
of learning? Nor should we ignore 
our social responsibility as an arts 
institution to provide meaningful 
educational opportunities for all stu- 
dents to mix, mingle, and maturate 
as they learn to sing their songs of 
innocence as well as their later 
songs of experience. 

When university arts programs 
like ours begin to promote an under- 
standing and an appreciation of the 
cultural and historical backgrounds 
of a diverse and three-dimensional 
society then, perhaps, we will be 
able as both artists and educators to 
realize the heightened vision of Ihe 
philosopher Karl Barth: 

'To create a meaningful world in 
which excellence is at the very heart 
of personal education. Where the 
pulse of the individual spirit seeking 
knowledge and creative direction is 
the life-blood of higher education. 
And where the imprisoned spirit 
finds iis true freedom of expression 
in lofty artistic goals and objectives 
that instantly transforms into the 
truly excepdonal.

A soldier's story 

by Perry Monroe 

Monroe briefs new students 



The summer is over, and I sec a 
lot of new faces around campus. If 
you were not on campus this sum- 
mer, wc missed the pleasure of 
getting lo know each other. This is 
a good time to get acquainted. I 
am what the administration refers 
to as a non-traditional returning 
adult student. 

Over the coming fall semester, I 
hope wc will come to a better 
understanding of each oihcr. Let 
me first start by telling you a Iitlle 
bit about myself. As a divorced 
father of three boys, I have done 
many different things over the past 
34 years. Presently, I work a 40- 
bour shift at a factory in Butler, 
[ml It has had more than its share 
of ups and downs in the seven 
years I have worked there. 

My military career spans a total 
of 14 years of active and reserve 
duly. I enlisted in the Marine 
Corps in 1979 and currently work 
in munitions at ihe Air National 
Guard — I make bombs. During 
my stint with the Marines, I was 
both a radio operator and an M-60 
machine gunner. My highest per- 
sonal decorations are the Purple 
Heart with oak leaf cluster and the 
Navy Commendation Medal with 
"V" device, earned for valor. I 
have been lucky enough to travel 
to over 20 different foreign coun- 
tries. 

Although I started writing my 
column this summer, don't con- 



fuse me with a journalism or com- 
munication major. Actually, I'm 
just a mild-mannered Fine Arts 
major trying to belter myself. 
Considering my past. 1 can better 
appreciate my time here at IPFW. 

It is my hope that many non- 
traditional students will relate lo 
the topics 1 plan lo discuss in 
future columns. Likewise, the tra- 
ditional student will get a glimpse 
into a different world that age has 
opened to us. It is hard to believe 
that many freshmen were only 
three years old when I graduated 
from high school. 

There are many subjects I feel 
very strongly about, such as con- 
stitutional rights, education, and 
veterans' affairs, and when I 
returned to IPFW, I made a resolu- 
tion to get involved in student 
activities. Unfortunately, many 
students don't get involved in sim- 
ple activities. 

I am involved with a group of 
students and veterans who would 
like to sec the establishment of a 
veterans' memorial on the campus. 
Many students and faculty have 
served their nation in ihe armed 
forces with little or no recognition. 
The veterans of IPFW want to 
invite everybody to join with on in 
this project. At present, we are 
fonning a steering committee to act 
as liaison between the administra- 
tion and the community. 

In the future, I would like to 



see the establishment of a co»»pcr- 
ative support system for veterans, 
This system would help veterans 
settle into the university and 
would introduce ihcm to various 
departments. 

The fallacy that our armed 
forces are made of mindless robots 
is effectively demoralizing the 
men and women serving in the 
military today. Our public is 
unaware that large numbers of vet- 
erans arc angry and demoralized at 
the siring of broken congressional 
and presidential promises. Today's 
all-volunteer armed forces are in a 
slate of massive transition, if not 
an irreversible decline. The 
"downsizing" of our forces, due lo 
inc end of the cold war and budget 
constraints, has been less than 
orderly. 

Many times I have been vic- 
timized by our government's 
desire lo cul jobs. My regular job 
is equally unpredictable since I 
work ai an automotive -based pro- 
duction facility. In reluming (o 
IPFW to belter myself, there is a 
part of me thai wanted lo express 
the hardships returning adults 
face. 

In gelling acquainted, wc will 
sbarc both good times and bad 
times during the fall semester. As 
an older student I ol'len look back 
ai the past. After all, if you don't 
know where you're going, you 
don'l know where you've been.

Satire 



Dear Michael: Come out! Your record sales won 1 suffer! 



By PaulTupptr 
Stuff Columnist 

This is a sad period for homo- 
sexuals around [he world. Michael 
Jackson has truly married Lisa 
Marie Presley. Jus! as it seemed thai 
Michael was on the verge of com- 
ing out of the closet, he surrendered 
to the pressure of the music busi- 
ness, his family, and lo homo- 
pbobes who probably do not buy 



his albums, anyway. 

Let mc ask.. what would it matter 
if the "King of Pop" announced he 
is gay? Would his album sales 
slide? Would he be any less talent- 
ed? Would we love him less? 

Far be it from me to stereotype, 
but who is he fooling? 

Not any homosexual with the 
weakest gay-dar! He was born a 
black man, but he has somehow 
turned into a little while girl. If he is

heterosexual. I want Geraldo Rivera 
to do a prime-time special to prove 

Elton John is still dealing big. 
Melissa Etheridge is at the peak of 
her career. Boy George has made a 
comeback. Why can't Michael 
come out and still have a career? k. 
d. i.irn- can out sing any while girl. 
Me'shcll N'degay Ochelle has a hit 
with Hoosier boy John 
Mcllencamp. So why is Michael 



ashamed of himself 

Many of you might be asking 
yourself. "How can Paul be so sure 
thai Michael Jackson is gay?" Well, 
besides looking like a drag queen in 
need of a makeover from Vicki 
Lawrence, look at the statistics: 
Kinscy has said that one in ten peo- 
ple are homosexual (I say more, but 
he's done the official study). Joseph 
Jackson has fathered ten children. 
Michael certainly could be that one 



that Kinscy postulated. 

We all know what Michael can 
gain from this merger Lisa Marie 
owns the SlOO-million-and- growing 
Graccland. I believe she owns the 
rights to much of the Elvis library, 
also. And of course, this could put 
an end to the rumors of Michael 
being gay. 

But what docs Lisa Marie gain? 
Well, no matter what anyone else 
thinks. Michael will make a great 



father for ber children 

Plus, she won't have to worry 
about gold diggers falling at her 
feet. Bui she can't be sexually 
attracted to him — surely she saw 
how badly he kissed Iman in the 
"Remember lbc lime" video 

Whatever the excuses, it's sad to 
know that Michael thinks he h.is to 
do this •!! we will itill love him. 
Come out, Michael! We'll love ya, 
anyway.

Smoking decision 
snuffs out 
student input 

As of August 6, the last official 
smoking area for students is no 
longer available, thanks to former 
Chancellor Joanne Lanlz, 

It is quite ironic how this came 
about, considering this decision 
was made without student input 
and during the summer period. 
Could this be the due to the fact 
the majority of student body pop- 
ulation is not on campus during 
the summer? 

Pardon us, but is it too much to 
ask for just a little respect on the 
part of the administration? 

Aside from bruising Ms. 
Lantz's considerable ego. what 
would it have cost the administra- 
tion to put the issue up for public 
debate? 

Is it naive to think that, as stu- 
dents, we are capable of intelli- 
gent discourse on matters that 
directly affect the student body? 

These arc questions that need 
to be answered. Implementing 
controversial policies on the way 
out the door is not a responsible 
way of managing a campus. Is it? 

Dissenters will ask, "What's 
the big deal? I don't smoke. Why 
should I give a damn?" 

If we do not take a stand on 
this issue — or any other issue that 
affects the student body — we arc, 
in effect, sending the administra- 
tion the message that it is OK to 
ram through sneaky policies. 

If students choose to not par- 
ticipate in the system in which 
they are the major financial sup- 
porters, then they are bound to be 
recipients of rules and regulations 
that they are not particularly fond 
of. 

So stand up for your rights and 
make a fuss. No, you may not be 
popular with those making deci- 
sions, but your resounding voices 
and actions certainly will not be 
ignored. Will they? 

This is your school, and with- 
out students there are no faculty, 
staff members, deans of schools, 
or administrators. Think about it.

Asteroids hit Jupiter, 
provide vital information 



Unveiling the mysteries of 

SPACE 



When several fragments of 
comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 pum- 
mcled Jupiter on July 17, Ihe world 
was waichtng and wailing. 
Astronomers from alt pans of the 
world anlicipaied the largest cosmic 
collision m recorded history. 

First predicted in May of 1993 to 
hit Jupiter, Ihe chunk of rock broke 
Into about Iwcniy pieces before 
actually hilling ihe planet at over 
130,000 miles per hour The first 



fragment, called Fragment A. 
slammed inio (be atmosphere ai 
about 134,000 mpb. forming a fire- 
ball 1000 miles high and 4000 
miles in diameter 

The largest impact was made by 
the 7lh fragment, caJlcd Fragmcnl 
G. in the evening of July 17, form- 
ing a fireball 5000 miles wide and 
up io 1600 miles high. The explo- 
sion was so large ii could be seen 
from the earth even though the col- 



lision occurred on the oiher side of 
Jupiicr. The explosion was thou- 
sands of times more powerful than 
any nuclear weapon man has made 
and reached a temperature of 
53.000 degrees. 

Soon afler the impact, the fire- 
ball disappeared and the tempera- 
ture at ihai pan of ihe atmosphere 
dropped to 300 degrees below zero. 

The asteroids were not expected 
lo bit Jupiter with such force 




Many astronomers predicled they 
would break apan further before 
impact resulting in a meteor shower 
in Jupiter's atmosphere 

It i- unlikely that any of the frag- 
ments could have reached Jupiter's 
planetary surface without disinte- 
grating, since the atmosphere of 
that planet is 800 miles deep. 

In the coming monibs. 
astronomers will continue to 
observe the planet's cloud cover 
near the impact sites to learn mote 
about the atmospheric behavior of 
Jupiter itself. 

This was an event long awaited 
by astronomers around the world 
because new experiments in astron- 
omy arc expensive and difficult to 
conduct. Typically, they wait until 
a natural phenomenon occurs in 
space and record data from it. The 
phenomena observed on Jupiter by 
our scientists was, as Heidi 
Hammel, a planetary scientist at 
Harvard University put it, nature's 
way of conducting an experiment 
is. 

Lale next year, many scientists 
will follow up with more data col- 
lecting of their own. The satellite 
Galileo will send a probe into 
Jupiter's upper atmosphere to take 
readings of its pressure and compo- 
sition. 



What if the asteroid had hit the earth? 

dust thrown into the atmosphere 
would block much sunlight, and 
many species of life on our planet 
would pensh u a result A till of 
the rotational axis of the eanh. 
which would result in large-scale 
flooding, would also be possible. 

Looking at Jupiter's atmosphere 



What might a similar collision 
have done to Earth? The asteroid 
may have melted some of the 
earth's crust away around Ihe 
impact sight, and large fires would 
bum on the planetary surface. A 
"nuclear winter" would follow; 



Fragment G hit Jupfter's atmosphere at an approximately epeed of \ZAPOO mph, 
creating a fireball 1600 miles high by 5000 miles In diameter, and reaching a 
temperature of 53POO degree. 



What astronomers are seeking as 
the rocks bit Jupiter are secrets of 
Ihe plancl's atmosphere. Many 
astronomers have only guessed at 
the consistency of Jupiter's atmos- 
phere — until now. Now, the trail of 
the rock through the atmosphere 
should reveal some of the composi- 
tion of the atmosphere for certain. 

Experts have hypothesized that 
Jupiter's atmosphere consists of lay- 
ers of helium, ammonia, oiher com- 
pounds and waier. As the rocks 
crashed into the atmosphere, 
infrared and light spectrum analyses 
revealed sulfur and ammonia, but 
very little water. Scientists believe 
the ammonia layer begins about 25 
miles below the top of the atmos- 



phere, so the readings of ammonia 
indicate the rock plunged at least 
that deep into the atmosphere 

Atmospheric sulfur is believed to 
account for the bright colors seen on 
Jupiter. 

The apparent absence of water in 
Jupiter's atmosphere poses a prob- 
lem for some theoretical scientists 
If water had been present, they 
believe their theories about the origin 
of the solar sysiem would be con- 
firmed. 

Since water is lacking, they may 
need to form a new hypothesis about 
the beginning of the solar system. 
Just because water wasn't detected 
in the atmosphere, however, doesn't 
mean it Isn't there 



Comet or asteroid? 

Shoemaker-Levy 9 was commonly called a comet, but it was really 
an asteroid. 

Comets are ditty snowballs in space with lails of gases pointing 
away from the sun, Asleroids. on the other hand, are chunks of rock 
that do not have lails, Lending to the confusion between asteroids and 
comets, asicroids have orbits similar to those of cornels. Shoemaker- 
Levy 9 had no tail of gases and was, therefore, an asteroid. 



Scarred atmosphere puzzles scientists 



After the rocks crashed and the 
resulting fireballs disappeared, dark 
scars remained in Jupiter's upper 
atmosphere. The dark scars are 
abnormal because new features 
found on the surface are typically 
lighter in color than Ihe surrounding 
clouds. Scientists believe there are 
two possible reasons for ihe abnor- 
mal scarring. 



If (he rocks plunged deep into 
the atmosphere, they would have 
released some of Ihe heavier gases 
into the upper atmosphere. The 
heavier gases (like oxygen or nitro- 
gen) are darker in color than the 
lighier gases normally found in 
Jupiter's upper atmosphere, and 
could account for the scars. 

The scars could also be 



of the shattered rocks left in the 
atmosphere. 

The rocks would have been 
composed of heavier material 
which would make the debris 
appear darker than the surrounding 
atmosphere. 

It is interesting to note that the 
scar which resullcd from Fragment 
G was larger than the planet earth.

IPFW student creates 'Wall of Time' for the city's bicentennial 



Last year's IPFW lhealri&lt;nl production of "Hair," one of the many rea

A mural designed by IPFW 
senior ceramics major Bob Panza 
was dedicated last Saturday by 
Mayor Paul Helmke as pan of Fort 
Wayne's Bicentennial recognizing 
the city's youth, past, present and 
future. 

The ceramic mural, entitled "The 
Wall of Time," was unveiled at 
Kids Crossing, a playground 
designed by children within Lawton 
Park. 

The mural is sponsored by the 
Allen County Court Appointed 
Special Advocates (CASA) and 
portrays images of Fort Wayne his- 
tory and ihe part that children 
played. CASA is a non-profit orga- 
nization consisting of trained volun- 
teers that assist the Welfare 
Department in helping child abuse. 

According to Panza, the two 
main reasons for the mural was to 
celebrate children in Fort Wayne,

Mvsic Reveiio 



Nicks proclaimed 'Queen of Rock' 



By Paul Tupper 
Staff Writer 

In 1983. Rolling Slone magazine 
crowned Sicvic Nicks as the Queen 
of Rock music. 

In 1994, with the release of 
"Street Angel." she proves she's the 
Queen. Listen to the song "Kick it," 
about drug addiction, and you will 
hear that die song and the singer 
does just thai. 

Stcvie's last effort, "The Other 



Side of the Mirror." was a magic 
concept album thai fell short of her 
irue form. Bui on "Sireci Angel," 
sbc is in focus. 

The first and best cul, "Blue 
Denim." is a song about bumping 
into a forgolten love and trying to 
move on: "So I'm going away for a 
little whilc/lorerriemberhow to feel." 

Sicvic has always had a way of 
harmonizing with guesi players. 
and she holds true here on (he title 
cul with David Crosby on a story 



about homeless youth. 

The only misslep is the remake 
of (he Bob Dylan classic "Just Like 
A Woman." Dylan provides help on 
guitar and harmonica, but some 
songs should not be touched. 

Over all. "Street Angel'' is a 
greal work of arl from a woman 
who has dropped a cocaine babii 
and Fleetwod Mac, a band thai 
owed all of its success 10 her.

Two high school siudenis. 
Jeremy McFcrrin and Paige Strong, 
designed the initial artwork wiih the 
help of Fori Wayne historian Mike 
Hawfield. 

The entire process took abotil six 
weeks. With ihe help of the 
Learning Resource Center, he first 
looked at the artist's rendition of 
the drawings and then converted the 
drawings to a 6 x 9 fool scaled 
mural.. 

With an overhead projecior. he 
transferred the scaled rendition to 8 
x 8 inch tiles Panza then performed 
a glaze test for the correct tempera- 
ture and color. Trim was made for 
any overlapping tiles. A loial of 1 1 7 
8x8 inch liles made up the 9 foot 
mural. 

"It creates problem solving and a 
form of communication," said 
Panza. 

"This project is a connection 
between our city and our campus," 
said Panza.

Athletic director to step down 



By Krbtk Rlccl Schlundl 
Editor In Chltf 

Arnic Ball. H' l V, athletics 
director and IPFW men's volley- 
ball coach, -mi that il is too diffi- 
cult to coach and concentrate on 
overseeing athletics at the same 
lime. 

Consequently, Ball will step 
down as athletic director and redi- 
rect his professional focus — as 
soon as a suitable replacement is 
found, thai is, 

"I have really enjoyed being 
athletic director since 1987. but 
our program has grown by leaps 
and bounds," Bail stated. 

He said that one factor that 
influenced his decision to relin- 
quish his directorship is his com- 
mitment to developing a new 
physical education curriculum at 



IPFW in conjunction with the 
School of Education. 

"We are working toward offer- 
ing a P-E. major here — eventual- 
ly." Ball said. 

Ball is also working to develop 
the men's volleyball program: 
"The volleyball program needs to 
continue to grow as all our pro- 
grams," he said. 

Walt Branson, IPFW vice 
chancellor of financial affairs, is 
overseeing the search for a new 
athletic director. 

Branson commented, "It's real- 
ly to Amie's credit that the athlet- 
ic department has grown so 
much. ..but he convinced us (bat, 
in order to keep athletics growing, 
he needed to step down and let 
someone else concentrate on 
direcdng athletics. His first love, 
after all. is coaching." 



"We're in the process of estab- 
lishing a search committee right 
now." Branson added 

He added thai representatives 
on the search committee will be 
drawn from the athletic depart- 
ment, primarily. About six to eight 
representatives from athletic 
department faculty and staff, the 
Royal Dons club and the student 
body will make up the committee. 
Branson said. 

The university has already 
begun (o advertise nationally for 
candidates to fill the available 
position in publications such as 
the Chronicle for Higher 
Education and the NCAA News. 

"We had hoped to have the 
position filled by Nov. I." said 
Branson, "but that's probably too 
optimistic. We plan to have the 
position filled by Jan. 1. 1995."

After finishing a season of 17-10 
overall and 10-8 in the Great Lakes 
Valley Conference, the Lady Dons

coach for the spring semester. 

Pam Bowden will be replacing 
former basketball coach Eileen 
Kleinfelter. who left for a coaching 
position at The University of 
Findlay in Ohio. 

Bowden. a native of Saginaw,

After leaving her alma mater at 
Spring Arbor college. Bowden left

College, Bowden joined the athlet- 
ic staff at the University of Alaska, 
Anchorage. Bowden not only 
assisted in helping the team acquire 
a 21-7 year record, but the team 
also participated in the NCAA 
tournament during the '91-'92 and 
'92-"93 seasons. 

"We look for her to continue the 
success coach Kleinfelter has had 
in the past. We arc very pleased 
that she is here," said Amie Ball, 
athletic director and men's volley- 
ball coach.

Muth to coach IPFW men's basketball team 



By Sharmln McGown 
Guest Writer 

Baseball has been a pari of Tom 
Mulh's life from a very early age. 
He played for a Little League team 
as a child and continued playing 
baseball all the way through col- 
lege. Realizing baseball was his 
niche, he decided to use his skills in 



coaching. Muth, former head coach 
of the Southern Wells High School 
team, joins IPFW athletic depart- 
ment staff as the new baseball 
coach. 

Muth is replacing Matt Kinzcr, 
who left the post this summer. 
Kinzer left IPFW with a record of 
42-36 over the course of two years. 

"I have always wanted to coach 



college baseball," said Muth. 
"When the opportunity came, I 
couldn't pass it up; 1 bad to give it a 
try." 

Although he concedes that there 
arc differences in coaching tech- 
niques, Muth believes his style dif- 
fers from Kinzer only in his 



approach. 

"I don't know what his particular 
philosophy was on coaching, but I 
prefer to be very low-key," Muth 
said "I'll do what I can to prepare 
the team for the game, but there 
isn't much (hat can be done during 
the game."

In the past, frustrated IPFW stu- 
dents arriving for classes at the begin- 
ning of a new fall semester have 
racked up a large number of campus 
parking violations, but not ibis year. 

According lo Lieutenant Motz of 
University Police and Safely, the 
campus access on 37 "diverts much 
of the student traffic to the parking 
garage and Athletic Center lots 
where parking is accessible." 

Nevertheless, Molz noted that 
university parking permit holders 
park in metered areas — a violation 
which carries a S10 fine. 

"Meters provide parking for cam- 
pus visitors — people who have no 
connection to the university, like par-
