-Certain areas of the building thai

are not niled mth students because 
they are designated as hallways,

that are usually filled with only one rr

—Sunlight does not help the healing

—The building was designed lor an 
average winter of zero degrees. 

An unnamed source told The Com- 
municator that by the end of Christmas 
break, the building was so cold, many 
staff members were calling In sick 
rather Ihan working cighl hours in what 
they called an "ice bo It" 

The reason for Ihe "Icebox lem

building lost luo o[ the (our sources

Katler gave The Communicator 
reporter a lour through the building 
Jan. 21, and pointed out six Inef- 
ficiencies ollhe building. 

—Due to Ihe proximlly of the air 
handling unit, the outside air 
Icmperalure loses two degrees as it 
passes through the handler "If a 76 
degree air went throu^ the handler, il 
would flow oul at 71 degrees," Kaller 

—Two offices in ihe building are 
wilhoul heating grales, Kalter said. 
These grates form one of the tour 
sources of heal In Ihe building 

—The source of heat comingfrom the 



: healing problem is 
Bl.ll under consideralion by Ihe Plan- 
ning and Engineering Deparlment and 
the Physical Plant of Purdue, West 
Lafayette. Help will come from the 
dalgners of Shenkel Shulli and 
Associates of Fort Wayne and Waller 
Scholer and Associates of Lafayette, 

Kalter said the lolerance of Ihe 
faculty and slalf has helped the 
situation and that it u ill be helped even 
more when warmer weather comes. 

Kaller said Ihe Physical Plant helped 
the situation by scaling Ihe venis on the 
lump hoods in Ihc unoccupied medical 
labs. The plan also reversed Ihe heat 
flow in the Medical Lab's blowers He 
emphasized that these solutions were 
only U:mporary and that a pcrmanenl

started at 16, and worked until they 

yean in length. Thus, ma sense, the 
uottI "career " was used U3 identify 
Ihe constant thread Ihal ran 
throughout a man's or woman's life 
to the vmrld of work. The Issue was: 
what was il that comprised thai 
common thread? 

WeU, in Tlie Olde Days, il was 
probable that an Individual woriied 
most of his or her life In the same 
orgaaiulion. So. it was the

I3r a man v.au)d work all his life lor 
Sears, Roebuck, and rise from clerk 
to company president. Tlial was the 
c ul t ura I e xpec ta lion . 

In the case of a woman, the 
cultural expectation was that she 
would begin as a secretary and rise 
to ... secretary Ail, of course, within 
Ihe same organiialion. People 
came, in time, to speak of "a career 
ladder" within that organiialion lo 
designate an Individual's rise. 
CAREER EQUALS HELD 

This concepl ol a career ladder 
began, In time, to t&gt;e discarded. 
People began lo notice Ihal in- 
dividuals did not stay within the 
same organization all of their 
wording lives. Workers moved

another Ifthewordcsreerwercatili

in Ihe tame field. Today's doctor 
might be lomorroiv's jaa musician. 
Yesterday's clergyman might be 
todays businessman. That is where 

The language of careers, however, 
still depends upon yesterday's 
history; our notion of "career" still 
equates 11 with 'Tield." Example:

Of course, if a carpenter is going

But the common mythology holds 
that everyone contemplating a

The VISA supplements are only one 
of Ihc innovative ways the continuing 
education department is adverstlsing 
their revamped "Learn and Shop" 
program to the community. Olfercd in 
fall of 19S0 at Souihtown Mall, this

successful. 

"When the program was offered 
before, additional marketing hadn't

education. "We hadn't covered a large 



According to Jonas, classes are also 
needed which will "enhance a person's 
ability to obtain and be elliclenl in a 
Job." 

"Sometimes people will think an 
innovative program olfcred al a dlf- 

qualily," said Linda Ballhoser, 
assistant to Ihe Dean ol Arts and Let- 
ters. "This is not so Students will be 
expected to perform at the same level 
as other classes. The Inlegrily of the

courses will not t&gt;e taught by part-time 
faculty tut by resident faculty. "The 
quality level of the prolessors has not 
been skimped by any means." added 
Balthaser. 

Frank Codispotl, a political science 
professor who wilt be leaching the

"After five or ten years away from 
school many people haven feeling they 
can'l learn again," said Jona^. By 
offering university level cbsses at off 
campus locations, the pri^ram will 
attempt U encourage those who have a 
reluctance lo come to the campus 
"People lend to shy away from the 
bureaucracy that the campus entails." 
said Jonas. 

According lo Jonas Ihc "Learn and 
Shop" concepl has been very successful 
at lUPUI in Indanapotis By again 
attempting the program in Fort Wayne, 
the continuing education departmeni is 
hoping 10 establish a presence outside 
ol the university grounds. "If the 
program does takeoff, if the additional 
public relations helps, we'll probably 
try again at Souihtown. More people 
will t&gt;e familiar with the program and

As of Jan. 25, Fort Wayne I^iblic 
Transportation Corporation will begin 
using the Tire lane behind the union as a

The ad\-antages of this plan were 
detailed in a letter by John Roiencrans, 
chairman of the IPFW Joint Tnf fie and 



Parking committee. 

-'The new stopt would serve the 
north end of campus and encourage btis 
use for four buildings In aU," 
Rosencrans said. 

"Riders would not have to wall for a 
bus in a muddy patch of grass, or in n 
snowbank, or loo clo»e to traffic," he 
added. 

To put this plan into practice, several 
handicapped parting spaces hai-e been 
moved. The Communicator was unaUe 
to find oul where these spaces will be 
relocated.

Students must

[0 St^Ie Road riT He was about 
Ihe crosswalk in East Campus Drive 
when he looked in his right. A car had

he stepped into the crosswalk, he nnllecd 
a car coming in the opposite direction 
was not going to slap and the man 
driving was honking his horn. The 
pcdealrlan Jumped back and saved his 
lire. 

students who walk lo Ihcir classes 
from Iheir cars should be able to cross 
campus drives without having to wait (or 
a long line oF cars (o pass by. Unler- 
tunately, this Is not always true. 

Two yield signs that say, "Yield lo 
Pedestrian in Crosswalk," are located al 
each end of East Campus Drive, Two 
more are located al each end oF West 
Campus Drive. 

These four are the only yield'lo- 
pedestrian signs on campus, and there 
are several crosswalks where 
pedestrians should be yielded to, but at 
limes they are not. 

The Communicator feels some drivers 
arc disobeying these signs, and it asks 
them to pay more attention and stop for 
pedestrians: however, all of the blame 
does not fall on the shoulders of IPPW 
drivers With only (our yield signs 
pasted, along with several dingy'Colored 
crosswalks. It is evident many drivers do 
nol know this rule 



The Communicator feels the Traffic 
Advisory Committee should have yield 
signs placed al every crosswalk, 
especially al this time when the 
crosswalks are sometimes covered with , 

The Advisory Committee should a!so 
make sure Ihe crosswalks are always 
painted so Uiey can easily be seen, even 
at night. This should prevent them from 
blending in with Uie asphalt in late 
spring 

The University Police should crack 
down more on speed limit violators and 
drivers who fail lo stop for pedestrian 
yield signs. At this time of year. Ihe 
roads are slick. People who drive fast 
will not be able to stop al a crosswalk. 

The Indiana Bureau for Molor Safety 
prints a booklel containing Ihe rules ^ 
the road, and in that booklet are the 
words "Drive Defensively." 

The Communicator advises IPFW 
pedestrians lo "walk defensively" if 
they want to try their luck at using Uie 
crosswalks. 

The Communicator realizes that 
painting crosswalks more often and 
providing mare pedestrian yield signs 
may cosi more money for the university, 
but it feels that the students' safety is 
mere important than saving green- 

IPFW would like lis students lo walk 
away with Iheir lives as well as an 
education.

out of Ihe film. 

After Scolt leaves, the film 
tries lo build up intensity,

as the boy, seems too earnest 
and can't hold Ihe film's 
dramatic locus "Taps ' is a 
film whose title would make

"Ghost Story" is a rarity

To direclor John Ini'in's

though.

outdoor activities during 
these cold dajs of Januar)'. 
They enjoy going loa nearby

racing to the bottom with tar 
more speed than the con- 
ventional sled allows. 

This sport is called tubing. 
The wlnler in Fort Wayne Is 
providing excellent con- 
ditions for thcsport. 

Some of the best hills are 
located in the parks. The 



Soap Box Derby 
Franke Park and the hill nl 
Reservoir Park are two of 
the best in Fort Wayne. But, 
they aren't Ihe only two. 
Someol the other parks also 
have hills. Hamillon Park, 
located on Spring Street, has 
a unltpJe double hill near the 

People take part in this 
type of activity, even without 
a lube. They come lo the bill 
with old-fashioned sleds with 
medal runners, or with one 
ol the new-fangled plastic
