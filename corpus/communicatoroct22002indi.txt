BLOOMINGTON, Ind, — Two 

Erograms at Indiana University 
loomington and two at lUPUl were 
recognized by U.S. News and World 
Report as "Programs thai really work" 
in the magazine's annual ranking of 
the nation's top colleges and universi' 
ties. The magazine also rated the 
undergraduate program at the Kelley 
Schoolol Business among the top 10 in 
the nation. 

The magazine recognized lU 
Bloomington for the quality of its edu' 
cat I on a I experience lor first-year stu- 
dents, which was also cited last year 
by Time magazine in naming lUB ils 
College oi the Year among research 



universities. lUQ also was cited for its 
successful efforts to encourage writing 
as an important part of the learning 
process at all levels and in all disciplines, 

lUPUl was recognized for its suc- 
cess in promoting leaming communi- 
ties — building connections among 
fellow students and between students 
and professors — and for its efforts lo 
promote service leaming — Ihc use of 
volunteering in the community as an 
educational strategy. 

Among undergraduate schools of 
business at both public and private 
institutions, lUB's Kelley School of 
Qusiness was rated tenth. The Kelley 
School placed second only lo the 



University of Michigan among 
undergraduate schools of business in 
Ihc Big Ten. 

Overall, the magazine ranked 
Indiana University Bloomington in a 
tic lor 2Bth among public national 
research universities. Ihe same rank- 
ing the 



tccognilion in livo areas, lU Northwest 
was rated among the most diverse 
master's level universities in the 
Midwest, and IPFW was raled as hav- 
ing the lowest average student debt 
load among Midwest master's level

campus. The policy, which would 
begin with theentering class in Ihe fall 
of 2003. also includes several cate- 
gories ol exemptions. 

The Bloomington campus 
already houses 92 percent of Orst-ycar 
students. That number is expected lo 
increase lo 98 percent (an additional 
4O0 students) with the new housing 
requirement. The additional housing 
needs can be met within Ihe enisling 
inventory of rooms on campus while 
accommodating the needs of relum- 
ing sludenU. 

"We're sending a strong message

'Living on campus oilers dUitinct 
advantages for student success, not 
only academically, but also in terms of 
maturity and adjustment. It gels new

Chancellor Sharon Stephens Brehm. 
who provided a briefing paper to 
members of the boanJ. 

The proposal had previously 
received support Irom Ihe 
Bloominglon Faculty Council and Ihe 



the leadership of Ihe lU Student 
Association and Ihe Intorfratomily 
Council. 

Those eligible for exemptions to 
the requirements include: lust-year 
students whose parents or guardian &lt; 
live within 25 miles of campus and ' 
who choose to live al home; transfer 
students who live within a 25-mile 
radius of campus; students who are 21 
years old before the start of Ihe firsi 
semester and married sttidenis or 
those who qualify under university . 
guidelines for domestic partnership. 

Also, requests for exemptions 
because of medical, cultural, Financial 
or other special circumstances will lie 
considered. At this poinl. fratemilies 
are considered on-campus housing,

Why would a 71-y( 
from Brown County pedal his bike a 
ttiousand miles across the stale of 
Indiana? David Hennessy says he's 
doing it to shoiv that senior citizeris arc 
shil a vital pari of our communities. 

He says liis main reason though, is 
lo raise awareness of what he calls the 
possible "Creeping Crisis" spreading 
through Indiana's middle class families, 
Hennessy behcves that many middle 
class fimiilies are, or soon will be. facmg 
the dilemma of wanting lo send their 
children lo college, but won't be able lo 
afford the tuition, 

Hennessy. says these families can't 
qualify for fmancial aid because their 
income is, in sjme cases, just above Ihe 
limit for federal or state tuition grants. 
He tielieves that this forces the parents 
and children to go into debt, accumulat- 
ing ivhat can amouni lo many thou- 
sands of dollars in sluoents !oar\s. 

Hennessy's solution is lo ride his 
bike across Indiana, raising money lor 



scholarships for qualified Brown 
County residents lo attend any college 
or university in Indiana. He is also urg- 
ing senior citizens across Ihe stale lo 
start scholarship funds in their commu-

Shelbv'ville, Hermessy will ride from 
Markfe into Fort Wayne Monday morn- 
ing, Ocl. 7. 

He will hold a news conference al 
10 a.m. on the IPFIV campus, in Ihe 
Walb Union Fireside Lounge, to talk 
about his fundraising efforts. 

Mark Franke, IPFW's director ol

Battling the Third Wheel Syndrome

Friends sutler /rom. I like locaJI It 
"Third Wheel Syndrome." It 
seems that some oF my Friends 
can'lgclddatelouve their lives. 

One friend seems lo have an 
especially hard time with the 
ladies, and I don't know why. 
He's a great guy. and though he 
may not be Fabio, he's still as 
— -* looking as some oF Ihe 
n tficsc "boy" bands thai 
seem lo go erazy For. He 

ly be a bit on the short side, 
Ijutso is Tom Cmise — ya know? 

This situation really bugs me 
For a couple of reasons: First, it 
makes it more difFicult to hang 
out with my buddy because it's 
really awkward to be with my 
girlfriend when he's there by 
FimselF. 

Second. I hear so many girls 
griping about their boyfriends, 

and then gel back together every 



other week. What docs a guy 
hafla do? I'd just like (or a Female 
to explain to me why my friends 
(who are great guys) can't find 
girlfriends! 

Venus Answers: 

First, it is important lo 
understand Ihat I am speaking 
purely from personal experience 
and hearsay, not from any slalis- 
lical or studied sources, I guess 
the real answer lies in Ihe hearts 

"^.il would be easier to go 
For the "nice" guy without ihe 
radiant blue eyes, gorgeous 
smile and brilliant body, but 
where would the fun in the chal- 
lenge be? I'm not saying Ihat 
there arc no nice, hot single guys, 
but Ihe majority of hot guys that 
girls go for arc Ihe gorgeous 
jerks. Honestly! And why doyou 
suppose that is? There is no iop- 
cflf reason why good girls go for 
bad guys. 

Don't you remember being 
Ihe "third wheel?" I've been the 
lag-along person before — only 
because my boyfriend at the time 
always had band gigs or whatev- 
er, so 1 went on living my life and 
went out with my Friends and 
tf\eir boyfriends or girlFriends. 




need to advise your Inend Io)usl 
be bold and ask a girl out. Hie 
worst Ihing she can say is "no." 
And, as far as you (ecling 
uncomfortable hanging out with 
him and your girl at Ihe same 
time, well, that's just something 
you have to deal with. My guy 
always picked his Friends before 
me, and it was just something 1 
had to accept. And I did. but it 
was nice to be included and il 
gave me a chance to gel to know 
ihe people he was hanging out 



hangmg out with hus friends 

So. like I said, just encour- 
age your friend to hang in there 
and not give up. Someone great 
will come along lor him when 
it's the right time. Just because 
you're ready for your Friend lo 
fird someone doesn't mean that 
it's his time' lust be patient and 
enjoy hanging out with your sin- 
gle buddyl

'ilh that. 
Wc've'been able lo pull il out a few

play more disciplined and consislent 
from Ihe start." 

The Mastodons' late rally began 
when Janelle Pollard took over service 
dulies wilh Ihe Grizzlies leading 23-16. 

Pollard served four straight points

points by Ihe lime Oakland regained 
possession off a kill by Karen Conger. 

The Grizzlies' Sara Miller served 
one point, but a kill by Souza ended 
Oakland's chance to make a nin. 

The two teams then traded service 
twice bclore Souza was able to put the 
game away with five consecutive 
points with the help of Iwo kills Irom 
Mo Mcinhart as ivell as a kill from 
Lindsay Brammei. 

"I think in tf^is game we took bet- 
ter care of the hall, and we played 
well," said Souza. "When we were 
behind. Coach just told us lo lake care 
of the ball and play hard."

We've beaten Ihis 
and il they'd beaten us. it would 've 
been considered an upset." Hartley 
said. "Upsets occur when the belter 
team doesn't play well, and the olher 
team works really hard. You have to be 
disciplined and you have to be focused, 
or you're gome to lose a game and 
maybe the matcn."

Souza with 18 kilts, eight digs and an

"Fabiana had a good night with 18 
kills. Mo Meinhart had a decent night 
hitting," said Hartley "We had 10 aces, 
which is pretty good to 10 errors, and 
I'll take that ratio except some of those 
ernars can't come when you're trying to 
make a comeback," 

IPFW got on the board first in Uie 



opening game, but Oakland eventually 
gained the lead at 5-4. Tlie Grizzlies 
went ahead by two before the Dorts lied
