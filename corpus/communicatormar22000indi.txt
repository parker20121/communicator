Celebrity actors present 'Langston and Martin'

RiveiinK and though! pro-

My spring 'break' 

by Adam Taylor, Editor 

Spring Break is finally here, and most of 
[he campus is happy about it. Well, probably 
everyone but me. If I survive the mid-term 
exams, the time has come for me to crack 
down and start churning out papers land no, I 
don't mean newspapers). 

This holiday used to be a Joyous reminder 
to me thai the semester is almost over. Now it's 
just a reminder that the semester is almost 
over and I am very overwhelmed. 

I have been attending IPFW for a little 
over three years and am lucky to say that I'm 
going to he graduating at the end of the fall 
semester. All I need is a few more history 
classes, a history seminar, a writing for history- 
class and all of my foreign language require- 
ments (on top of some others). 

Those sound like a lot of classes, but I'm 
not too concerned about them, for the most 
part. After all, I'm taking four of these classes 
this semester. Unfortunately, three of these 
four are the most difficult classes I'll need to 
graduate, and one of them Is a prerequisite Tor 
another one of them I'm taking. 

Despite these facts, 1 feel as though I'm 
doing fairly well In my classes. As good as 
could be expected from someone in this situa- 
tion, anyway. My instructors have been 
cvtremcly understanding so far, more so than 
they rightfully should be, and this has helped 
out a lot. Not being penalized for late assign- 
ments helps, and not having any set atten- 
dance policy In these classes helps as well— 
especially given the terribly distracting semes- 
ter it's been for me so far with moving, work 
and shaky health. 

No matter how overburdening the home- 
work can be, I can handle It as long as I'm not 
loo far behind in the class and still have the 
teacher's confidence. After all, I still have 
Spring Break 10 catch up on things, right? 
Sarcastically speaking, this should mean I 
won't have to worry about how I'll spend my 
time. Instead, my "vacation" will be divided 
between when I'm reading and when I'm not. 

I suppose I'm just bitter and I shouldn't be 
so negative. It could be worse. I guess I'll feel 
nice and productive during Spring Break when 
I'm doing all ol this catch-up work, too, espe- 
cially since I'll gel to see my family in 
Tennessee while I'm doing it. it's the part after 
Spring Break I'm not looking forward to. Thai 
is the part where 1 have two eight-page papers 
10 write as well as a ZO page-paper I have 10 
complete to graduate. That is also the part 
where I have to cram in as much Spanish as I 
can so 1 can gel double credit and hopefully 
move on lo Spanish II this summer. That is also 
the part where I try to keep things in line at 
this newspaper as well as try to make it to Mass 
Communications on time. 

I'm going to try lo not worry about any of 
it. though. After all, the semester is now 
halfway over and we'll be at its end in a couple 
short months. An end Is an end, whether good 
or bad. Then all I'll have to worry about is 
what to do during my week off from school for 



Spring: vacation from redundancy 




Two more days, ladles 
and gentlemen until the big 
event of the semester, Spring 
Break. One week free of class- 
es and less commuting. 
Where will you be nexi week7 
Some of us have the luxury of 
taking a vacation out of the 
dry or even out of the state. 
Others are spending the 
extra time in Fort Wayne 
working or hanging out with 

Although everyone has 
different plans, one thing we 
think all or you probably 
agree on is that It is nice to 
have a change of pace once 
in awhile. Who ever created 
the concept of a spring break 
has an excellent grasp on the 
lives of college students. 

We're always going from 
one place to another, cram- 
ming for tests and quizzes 
working and trying to have 
some type of social life In 
between the gaps of manda- 
tory, scheduled lime.

ally stay In the area, the out- 
look for this year's spring 
break is much beiier. For the

: of c 



output of waste is multi-lotted 
and, Just briefly, is affected by 
things like: I. indrviduality/inde- 
pendence-In order to be more 
self reliant we typically amass 
resources personally, rather than 
collectively. More simply put, we 
aren't very good at sharing, so 
we've got to have our own. 
Vehicle ownership is a perfect 
example ( as opposed to car pool- 
ing and mass transit.) 2. 
Nmelty 'irendiness-We love to 
by "worthless." Junk. Trinkets, 
"doo-dads," and ihe like nil 
many of our nearly obsessive col- 
leciions and tend lo get dumped 
when out of style, demand, or 
just plain lose their appeal to us. 
3. Instant gratiflca lion/ conven- 
ience- This could be one of the 



most powerful contributing 
"forces." Today's mobile, multi- 
tasked, and usually hurried soci- 
ety has created a huge market for 
single, easy, and ready io use 
provisions. Hence ihe abundance 
of "individually packaged" prod- 
ucts on the market today. 4. 
Combinations of these and/or 
other contributing factors-One 
good example Is the typically- 
American fascination with the 
packaging (i.e. presentation) 
itself, as in mostly-adult toy col- 
lectors who take special care not 
io damage the original packages, 
lest li would be lower the "value" 
of their collectable. Also we oflcn 
find cheap or useless ]unk in 
elaborate packaging. As Frank 
Zappa said in tine of his songs: °lt 
may be a little cheesy, but it's 
nicely displayed. Hey!" 

As much as I wish we were 
mature and self-aware enough as 
a society to effect major change 
in those areas (we are on our 
way-] don't know ir we are mov- 
ing or not, but ai least we're on 
the right track), thafs not the 
issue I really wish to address 
now. What I do feel we have the 
ability lo perform as an entire 
society, right now, is to stop 
wasting whatever by-products we 
can. Please (or in Nike lingo. Jusi 
Do Id) recycle. It should be one 
of all of our first priorities to 
help to save this weird place 
(earth), and keep it in the best 
possible working condition for 
our children and maybe even 
theirs. No one, except a few 
homeless castaways, wants to live 
In the immediate vicinity of a 
brimming trash dump. But we all 



will, if we don't do our part. 
NOW! 

Furthermore, 1 lend io be 
very critical of system of "higher 
education" that doesn't make 
much effort io curb and channel 
Its own wastefulness. The paper- 
recycling program is helpful, 
assuredly, and l"m proud io 
know that the student body had 
enough initiative to implement 
such a program. However, being 
a nighttime janitor in the ET 
building, I can personally attest 
to the large volume of recyclable 
paper that still goes Into waste 
cans. Why should anything that 
could be saved be thrown away 
instead? I'masking you. 

In reality the paper is just 
one pan of our waste problem. 
Especially notable are the alu- 
minum, plastic, and glass contain- 
ers comprising a substantial por- 
tion of what you throw away. 
Thai's really sad and rather irri- 
tating as currently I spend nearly 
an hour ever)' night sorting out 
the recyclables from your

difference: which it doesn't. I'm 
doing everything I can, but I'm 
only one person who's only 
responsible for one-lhird of one 
building. What about the rest! 
Well, few other janitors (or 
maybe they prefer "custodial 
technicians") save the aluminum 
cans that are close enough to the 
top of the trash to not have to Jig 
for. It's an easy way to make a 
couple of extra bucks to spend on 
fish food or something. But they ■

Let's avoid that end and get

higher education means and 
decide if teaming to he better cit- 
izens and more socially and envi- 
ronmentally conscious should be 
part of that education. Think 
about whether exposing cultural 
values dedicated to bettering

tem, and our world is as impor-

16th Amendment edge 

by Nick Metel, Staff Writer 

With the virtual elimination of Alan Keyes from the 
race for the Republican Presidential nomination, 
American voters have lost iheir final opportunity to 
elect a true tax reformer to the highest office in the 
land. When Keyes formally announces the end of his 
bid for the nomination, we officially lose Ihe opportu- 
nity' to vote for the only candidate from one of the two 
major parties who is willing to fight to repeal ihe 16th 
Amendment, abolish the federal Income tax, and elimi- 
nate the IRS. 

While neither Vice President Al Gore nor former 
New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley want to admit that their 
agendas would increase the revenue needed from tax- 
payers, both have actually proposed increases in feder- 
al spending. This, of course, would result in higher rates 
of taxation. These types of tax plans are simply not wor- 
thy of ihe American people. 

Texas Governor George W. Bush and Arizona 
Senator John McCain both speak of sizable tax cuts, and 
1 commend their efforts to return to the people what is 
rightfully theirs. Unfortunately . because nether candi- 
date calls for a reduction In the size of our bloated gov- 
ernment, their respective plans would merely rearrange 
the horrible tax burden. 

According to political activist and founder of the 
Future of Freedom Foundation Jacob Hornhcrger, If the 
federal government could be limited io providing only 
the programs that are delegated to the United Stales by 
the Constitution, it could function on S100 billion per 
year. Since tariffs and excise taxes currently supply the 
federal government with well over S100 billion a year, 
the federal income tax could be eliminated 
immediately. 

Harry Browne, political activist and author of "Why 
Government Doesn't Work." supports the idea of a mas- 
sive reduction to allow for the elimination of ihe 
income tax. "If s easy to sec how we can'i see the fami- 
ly who now can't afford braces for their child's teeth, or 
who must move into a smaller home, or who can't 
afford a college education for their children or the 
businessman who has heen driven bankrupt by govern- 
ment regulations and taxes. As long as you Ignore the 
people who have been hurl, any government program 
might seem worthy. 

The benefits or repealing the 16th Amendment and 
abolishing the federal income tax should be apparent 
to all. Browne estimates taxpay ers would save, on aver- 
age, approximately SI 2,000 per year. That would mean 
Ihe average Increase in take-home pay would equal 
S1.000 per monlh. What would you do with an extra 
51,000 per monlh? Give lo your favorite charity? Stari 
your own business? Buy that luxury Item you've been 
warning? This is the type of liberty and economic free- 
dom America w as founded upon. 

Browne sums up this position with one simple 
question. "Would you give up your favorite federal 
program if it meant you'd never have to pay income tax 
again?" I believe I speak for most hard-working 
Americans when I say yes, Indeed. 

What makes us human 

by Mishanna Wood, Managing Editor 

There is one-particular longdistance friend of mine 
who usually calls or writes to me when everyday life 
doesn't seem to be as grand as it should be. It Is sad, 



iy 



of 



call or write each other is irwhen we are feeling rather 
dispirited. The simplest things are the hardest io com- 
prehend. On many occasions I have asked myself how 
grand life is supposed io be. Somewhere in my soul the 
answer Is present. Everybody has their own unique 
interpretation of what the answer Is. 1 think it's not 
supposed to fit any description such as grand, easy, dif- 
ficult, horrible, short, good, bad, poor or rich. A per- 
son's mindset is a big factor lhal really determines the 
"typo" of lire he or she Uses no matter what the condi- 
tions are or what others may think. 

While we are completing our everyday routines, 
fulfilling our responsibilities, dealing with our struggles 
and going after our goals we forget about what makes 
us people. The heavy consequences that fall onto us, at 
work, school or with relationships, If we don't "follow 
procedure" or if we "make a misjudgmenl" make us for- 
get that obstacles are mandatory. Even though we know- 
that errors and barriers will arise, we just don't want to 
accept them. Errors cause complications and more 
heartache, however no living thing on this planet Is per- 
fect, (whatever thai means.) My friend and 1 get upset 
when things don't go well in our personal lives. Who 
doesn't? 

Once again my friend wrote me about how "things" 
aren't going so well. Ihe normal problems were present 
In her letter. 1 am lired of our routine, so I gave her an 
analogy that I'd like to share with you. Although it may 
seem rather corny, in a simple way people and leetcr 
totters function in ihe same manner. A normal teeter 
toner must have one half in the air and the other half 
on the ground. Each end has io continuously go from 
the earth to the air, from a low point to a high point. In 
order to keep momentum. 

People have to do the same thing. Every person I 
have ever met is not always "Just great" or "completely 
horrible." Throughout every week I have good days and 
bad days. Based on the people I communicate with on a 
weekly basis, it is perfectly normal io have "lows" and 
"highs." Unlike a teeter totter we can control how we 
depict a situation. 

Attitude in many ways is the "core" In all of us. It 
is another aspect that makes us human. During our 
"low times" it is extremely difficult to step a away from 
a situation and tell ourselves "we are only human" and 
"upsets are a necessity In life." I have not yet been able 
to do this when circumstances are unfavorable, but 1 
have tried. My life is pretty good, and I make this state- 
ment without comparing It to anyone else's. 1 hope the 
relationship between my friend and me changes lo one 
of more positive nature. Perhaps we will contact each 
other during "high" points In our lives. What kind of 
life do you have?

Comedienne brings New York style 
humor to Fort Wayne 



by Laura Schlegel, 
Staff Writer 



Last Thursday night. New 
York City comedienne Reno 
came to Fort Wayne's Cinema 
Center downtown and to 
William's Theater on Frtda&gt; 
night. 

Reno spoke mostly about 
feminist issues and even 
though some of her material 
was shocking, it was all hilari- 
ous. She covered local enigmas 
such as the lack of Fori Wayne 
citizens who to clean up after 
walking their dogs, as well ax 
worldly Issues such as how 



women should not copy men 
in certain gestures such as giv- 
ing the finger, because 
anatomically women arc noi 
Justified. 



-For ! 






people don't pick up after yi 
dogs. What's that about!" 
asked Reno on Friday. 

"Everyone says that New 
York's so dirty... yes, but we 
pick up after our dogs!" 

She covered religion, sex, 
prescription drugs, doctor's 
visits, social problems and Fort 
Wayne's radio. Along with 
these, she singled out Alanis 
Morissetlc For criticism. As 
many people know, Alanis 
Morlssettc's hit "Ironic" was a 



vcij popular song, but as Reno 
pointed out, her song has some 
fatal flaws. 

"It's like rain on your 
wedding day." Well, that's not 
ironic," said Reno. "It's a bum- 
mer or a gosh darn it, but 
that's not ironic. What's ironic 
is that she used the word 
WTong and it still sold like two 
billion copies. Now- that's 

She talked about her strat- 
egy for keeping Interested 
whik' having sex: by talking on 
the phone. And, of course, she 
covered the political spectrum. 

"Ifs like the whole presi- 
dency is about dicks these 
days," said Reno. "With Dole 



who can't keep It up and then 
Mr. Clinton who couldn't keep 
it down..." 

As the Journal Gazette 
had warned, Reno's act was Tor 
"mature audiences only." Even 
though most of hex jokes dealt 
mainly with women's issues, 
most of the men present 
seemed to find everything Just 
as humorous. 

With her New York accent 
and Yiddish words to cover up 
some vulgarity, Reno's per- 
formance was one of a kind. 
Rarely does the Midwest get a 
show that's so controversially 
funny and so up to date with 
the current women's Issues.

"Hello Rockview," while being 
more poppy than some of Less

also brings a new volume of 



common music listener who 
may not have listened to them 
before. While some bands try 
to change their sound to 
become more accessible to the 
mainstream. Less Than Jake 
writes songs that makes the 
mainstream interested in 
them, without losing their 
Identity. 

Less Than Jake is known 
for their concerts. The first 
time I saw Less Than Jake was 
at the Riviera Theatre In 
Chicago. The show opened 
with the band taking leaf blow- 
en and shooting toilet paper 
out to the audience, a fire- 
breathing clown and a body 
surfing clown who rode in a 
lifeboat. If you go to a Less

'Lord of the Dance f 
'rocks' Coliseum audience 



This past Sunday, 
Michael Flatiey's "Lord of the 
Dance" entertained a sold- 
out crowd at the Fort Wayne 
Memorial Coliseum. The 
energized troupe provided 

entertainment and amaze- 
ment during Its two-and-a 
half-hour performance and 
received at least two standing 
ovations. 

The energetic audience 
called for more at the end or 
the show and the "Lord of the 
Dance" troupe did not disap- 
point the enthusiastic crowd. 
During continuous applause 
and cheers, the dance troupe 
performed twice more. 

"Lord of the Dance" per- 
formed the story of ■The 
Spirit's Dream" through 
dance, song and music. The 
Spirit travels through space 
and time to help the Lord of 
the Dance protect his people 
from the Ancient clan and its 
leader as they try to chal- 
le*ige the Lord of the Dance. 

Throughout the per- 
formaoce, the Lord of the 
Dance comes across desire, 
danger and love. He has to 
decide between two women, 
Morrighan the gypsy and 
Saolrse, while trying to pro- 
tect the people and the little 
Spirit. 

The Lord of the Dance's 
decision to marry Saolrse 
leads Morrighan to help out 
the Ancient clan. By the end 
of the performance, the 
Lord of the Dance 

The members of the 
"Lord of the Dance" troupe

the Warriors, the Clan of the 
Celtics and the Girls of 
Ireland. They rocked the 
Coliseum throughout the per- 
formance. 

During every numb 



the mood of the music and 
the dance. 

The troupes performed 
with great enthusiasm and 
spirit throughout the entire 
show. There was not a single 
dull moment and there was 
no time for one to actually 
occur. If the troupe was not 
dancing, then there was Erin 
the Goddess singing or the 
two violinists "getting down" 
on stage. 



The 



rfor 



seemed to alternate between 
upbeat, loud dance and slow, 
quiet dance, keeping the 
audience members on the 
edges of their scats, waiting 
to see what would happen 

"Lord of the Dance" has 



ed In 



itloi 



acclaim. There are now three 
dance troupes that are cur- 
rently touring worldwide, 
employing 150 members and 
100 crew members. Since, the 
"Lord of the Dance" started 
In 1996, the performances 
given have received high 
reviews such as "powerful," 
"spellbinding," "genius on 
tap" and "dancer for the 
ages" from well-known pub- 
lications around the world. 

Flatlcy, who created, 
choreographed, directed and 
produced the show, was not 
present as his usual main 
character the Lord of the 
Dance. Those that have 
replaced him, though, arc 
filling his spot very well and 

keeping the performanc- 



es alive. If o

It is a dream which mil-

which If given the chance,

Men's basketball team finishes season, 'ready' for GLVC tourney 



by Brian Miller, 
Guest Writer 



The road 10 the confer- 
ence tournament (his year for 
the men's basketball team was 
one comparable to the auto- 
bahn. No speed limits, go as 
hard and as fast as you can! 
Did it work? 1 think most would 
agree that this Is an Improve- 
ment from last year. 1 think 
everyone would agree that this 
Is more entertaining to watch 
than last year's. 

The Dons entered this 
weekend not worrying if they 
were In the tournament, but 
what seed they would be, 
either 6th, 7th or 8th. 
Thursday. IPFW hosted 
Mlssouri-St. Louis, also a team 
good enough to get In the 
GLVC Tournament It was a 
game of spurts. The Dons 
jumped out to a 6-0 lead 



before UMSL 
run. IPFW matched that 7-0 
run with a run of their own, all 
within the first six minutes of 
the game. IPFWs lead extend- 
ed to 27-18 with 3 minutes left 
In the first half. However, 
UMSL would go on a 9-3 run to 
end the half at 30-27, IPFW. 

IPFW opened the second 
half with their biggest run of 
the night, 16-2, holding UMSL 
to just one field goal in the 
First seven minutes of the sec- 
ond half. At this point, it 
seemed that IPFW was well on 
the way to victory, up 46-29 
and the team started getting 
comfortable-may be a little too 
comfortable for IPFW Head 
Coach Doug Noll's liking. 

UMSL's guard Jim Schelich 
started to heat up, scoring 10 
of his team high 19 points in a 
ten-mlnuto stretch. This 
stretch UMSL went on an 18-3 
run as the Don's were clinging 
to a 57-56 lead with five min- 



in the game. Guard Steve 
Griffin came down and hit a 
key three-pointer from the cor- 
ner to put the Dons up 60-56. 
The teams traded baskets for 
the next four and a half min- 
utes, but things got interesting 
towards the end. UMSL, which 
had not had the lead since the 
game was 7-6, was only down 
by one with 10 seconds left In 
the game. 

Immediately, UMSL's Greg 
Ross fouled Brad Noll, who 
missed his first free throw and 
hit his second. UMSL got the 
ball as the Dons held on to a 
two-point lead. In the time-out, 
Coach Noll stressed defense 
and the importance of not 
fouling. 

So as UMSL struggled to 
inbound the basketball, they 
were forced to put up a Hall 
Mary and this one was not 
answered. The Dons won 74-72 
and had four scorers reach 
double digits. Junior Nick Wise 



had 16 points. Griffin had 13, 
Benji Gibbs had 12 and Brad 
Noll had 1 1. 

Saturday, the Dons faced 
Quincy University on Senior 
Day. The afternoon started 
with a prergame ceremony 
with the m\ seniors Dave 
Meshbergcr, Steve Griffin. 
Benji Gibbs, Randy Splcer, 
Aaron Ishman and Michael 
Akannl. In the shoot around, 
Benji Gibbs said. 'I'm ready. 
I'm ready." However, also in 
shoot around, Akanni got a 
technical foul for dunking in 
warm-ups, so the game began 
with foul shots instead of a tip- 
off and without any time 
expired, the Dons were trailing 
2-0. That would quickly 
change as IPFW defense caused 
a turnover and Gibbs drained 
a three to put the Dons up. 

It was -a seesaw battle, 
however, the Dons did trail 29- 
3B with four minutes remain- 
ing in first half. 



Then the Dons and the 
three-point shooting went on a 
18-7 run to close out the half 
with the Dons up 47-45, 
thanks to an Aaron Ishman 
basket as time expired. 

The second half, IPFW was 
up 71-63, but the sharp shoot- 
ing of Quincy guards Tyroese 
Stewart and Lampion Johnson 
took them on a 10-2 run and 
tied the game at 73. The teams 
traded baskets and Gibbs was 
having a career nlghL With 27 
seconds left, Gibbs jammed 
one home to put IPFW up 90- 
86. However, Quincy would 
Tight back. With 12 seconds 
remaining, Karecm Jabbar 
Cain hit a two and immediate- 
ly fouled Randy Splcer. 

Splcer missed the first free 
throw of a one-and-one and 
guard Lampion Johnson float- 
ed Into traffic, got fouled and 
made the basket. IPFW called a 
time-out to try and Ice 
Johnson, but he connected and 



Quincy was up 91-90. With 
only four seconds remaining 
on the clock Qulncy's defense 
smothered the Dons' shooters 
and Meshberger had to fire the 
half court shot that hit the rim 
and rattled out. 

Senior Benji Gibbs tmiy 
had a remarkable game, scor- 
ing 27 points, shooting 11-14 
and setting the IPFW career 
three-point field goal percent- 
age record. Steve Griffin had 
19 and Nick Wise scored 14. 

The loss didn't affect the 
scedings because Bellarmlne 
lost to Lewis, 86-81 and UMSL 
lost to St. Joseph's, 78-61. 
IPFW will have the sbtth seed of 
the conference tournament 
and will play Northern 
Kentucky, a team that lost last 
Saturday to a good Southern 
Indiana team, 75-60. IPFW 
plays Thursday, March 2 at 
noon at Roberts Hall In 
Evansvllle. 



Women's basketball team secures tourney bid with win over Quincy 



The women's basketball 
team entered this weekend 
needing a win to get into the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference 
loumamenL This was a situa- 
tion that most people didn't 
see the team being In at the 
beginning of the season. 

On Thursday IPFW hosted 
Missouri-Si. Louis. Earlier In 
the year, UMSL gave the Dons 
trouble, handing them an 87- 
75 loss at St. Louis. Their latest 
contest was a classic battle of 
two teams desperately trying 
to get that last playoff spot. 



In the first half, IPFW 
never trailed by more than two 
and ended up going Into half 
time with a 33-32 lead. 
However, the second hjl( IPFW 
had defensive lapses and did 
not regain that lead until 
freshman Shanle Smith hit a 
three-pointer with 8:15 left In 
the game. The three-poln

test. UMSL's center Jennifer

Trish Fleming got the rebound 
Fleming dribbled down the 
court and UMSL swarmed her 
She stopped and was called for 
traveling. 

This ignited the IPFW lans; 
most that saw it believed it to 
be one of many wrong calls of 
the night. Nevertheless, it 
gave UMSL another try and 
sure enough, Tawanda Daniel 
put up a tough shot to win the 
game 83-82. Holderman put 
up a game high 29 points; Kara 
Moore scored 17 and Smith 



scored IS. In what could have 
been a must-win game, the 
Dons caught a break when 
I e« it handed Kenturkv 
Wesleyan a 77-61 loss to lie 
them for that final spot which 
the Don's would win due to 
o-head competition. 

Saturday's game came 
down to "win and In," or a 
Kentucky Wesleyan loss would 
also put IPFW In the tourna- 
ment. Lucky for the Do'ns they 
were playing Quincy, a team 
that has only won 2 conference 
games all year, but that Is nev- 
ertheless a dangerous GLVC 
opponent.

Holderman scored IS poll 
the first half, 12 of which game 
from the foul line. Moore had 
14 as the two combined to 
outscore Quincy in the first 
half. IPFWs half-time lead of 
41-27 only grew as the second 
half got underway. At one 
point In the game, IPFW led by 
32 points. 

IPFWs convincing 76-S8 



victory' clinched them a play- 
off berth against Northern 
Kentucky. Holderman finished 
the game with 2B, Kara Moore 
had IS and Trish Fleming 
scored 14. Senior Mandy 
Loveless scored 8 points and 
grabbed 10 rebounds in her 
final home game. 

"We were playing two 
games we thought we could 
win," said Head Coach Karl 
Smesko. "Thursday, they make 
a tough shot to win the game 
and Saturday we had a real 
good defensive effort to win 
the game." 

As IPFW heads Into the 
conference tournament, the 
team is aware that It will be no 
easy task facing NKU. 
"Northern Kentucky is by far 
the best team In our confer- 
ence," Smesko said. "We've 
played them as well as any- 
body for a half but yet, when 
you have a lapse, they will run 
12 or 13 points off you In a 
matter of minutes and that 
frustrates us." 

In a year with many great 
stories at IPFW, the women's 



basketball team has gone 
through much adversity, los- 
ing guards Christy McMlllin 
and Amy Meyer, both of whom 
have the capability io score IS 
points a game, and yet the 
team still has found them- 
selves In the tournament. A 
major reason for that Is the 
way the team has stuck togeth- 
er and kept a positive attitude. 
The leadership or Junior 
Holderman has also been a 
plus. "Jamie Is the leader of 



i. Wee 






As the team heads Into the 
GLVC Tournament, they don't 
want to lose any Intensity. The 
first time the two teams met, 
IPFW had a hair-time lead that 
they couldn't keep and the last 
time they played, they trailed 
by three. If IPFW can put a 
solid 40 minutes of basketball 
together, don't be surprised if 
they pull an upset and become 
the Cinderella at this year's 
ball.

Men's volleyball team 
crushes rival Ball State, 3-1 



With the match tied at 
one game a piece, it was essen- 
tial to get out to an early lead. 
The Dons scored the first four 
points of the game and again, 



Last Friday IPFW hosted 
Ball State, a team the Dons l^" „,\.7 r ,,!V"i'iW' 
have not had a lot of success Jces and mi,. i mv w 
with in previous years, as Ball 
State leads the overall series 
43-17. The match began In 
front of 2,160 fans, the largest 
home crowd of the year. 

As expected, Ball State 
gave the Dons problems early 
getting an early 6-2 lead. The 
two teams would exchange 
points and sideouts and that 
lead would stay the same until 
the Cardinals scored the last 
three points of the game to 
win 15-9. 

People were left shaking 
their heads and questions 
ibout the 



vincingly 15-7. 

With the team just getting 
better game by game, fans 
were excited for the fourth 
Kame and what they saw might 
have been some of the best 
volleyball IPFW has played all 
year. The Dons wept up 6-0 to 
oi.ruu.illN win the match 15- 
2. 

Hector Soto led the team 
with 24 kills and Jeff Ptak had 
20. Chris Gisslen had a mag- 
nificent night at the net with 
61 assists. 

There were many bright
