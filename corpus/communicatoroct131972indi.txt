Keller adresses Senate 



The new Union building 
J will house a lounge, cafe- 
I terla, meeting room, Stu- 
I dents' Government, stu- 
I dent newspaper, and offices 
I for other campus organi- 
I zations. Keller said he 
I anticipated many activities 
I and programs previously 
] prohibited by lack of space.

I Chat clocks be installed In 
Che Academic Building, that 
I more trash containers be 
I located outside, and that 
I campus exits be re- 
I designed Co permit easier 
I access Co and from the 
I University.

I had been plans for clocks, 
I but these were vetoed from

I does not permit a left turn 
1 since that area is already 
I congested, A north exit

J he and ocher administra- 
I Cion members would wil- 
1 lingly meet throughout the 
I year with Senate members 
I to discuss any questions 
I or grievences concerning 
I the University. Senate 
1 members discussed the 
I possibility of inviting an 
I administrative speaker 
1 monthly.

I cerned methods for re- 
I cruiting more student feed- 
I back through senators.

^Boys in the Band' 
explores values 



The Boys In The Band de- 
scribed as, "The most un- 
abashed and forthright ac- 
count of the world of homo- 
sexuality yet seen in this 
era of growing artistic per- 
missiveness." will be pre- 
sented by Purdue- Indiana 
Theatre on October 20, 21, 
22 and 27, 28, 29. 

The play explores human 
values using as its setting 
and dramatis personae a 
birthday party acaneleganc 
New York to wnhouse at- 
tended by eight homosex- 
uals. The production em- 
ploys the use of explicit dia- 
log but is neither obcene nor 
disgusting due to Che hon- 
esty and insight of the writ- 
ing. The play's primary 
concern is with sexual 1- 
dentity, promiscuity and, 
most important, humanity 
and Inhumanity, 

The plot concerns Itself 
with a birthday party given 
by Michael, a heavily neu- 
rotic New York author for 
his friend Harold, "a 30 
year old, ugly, poclcmarked 
Jew Fairy". In attendance 
at the party are seven of 
Harold's friends and Alan, 
a "straight" college chum 



of Michaels who comes to| 
the party unexpectedly.

in Its four -lettered speech, I 
the play has an unmls-|

The Faculty Council of Ind- 
iana University's Bloom- 
ington campus Tuesday 
(Oct. 3) was w.arned that 
total expenditures would 
need to be cu: for the 
school year by one per cent 
below the budgeted a- 
m'.unt. 

â– Wh?le the fiaincial pro- 
b.'.em vi'5 face is serio'js," 
Vice Chancellor Roben'C. 
Turner said, "It is not a 
crisis. The payroll will be 
met." 

University President John 
W. Ryan earlier had an â€” 
no J need that budgetary 
problem^, were anticipated 
for the anrire University 
bccajss wh'.le enryllmftut 
wa? up JU3-: under one per 
ceni: from last year. It was 
below thÂ£ estlmite upon 
which budgets were 
figured. 

Turner, wbD is respons- 
ible for bjdgetary planning 
at Bloomlngton, told the 
faculty wh.5t the situation 
was for that campus. 

He said that the deficit 
In predcted Incom^to 
5218,034 in fees that would 
have been paid by 356 stu- 
dents who did nor show up 
for the current semester. 
He predicted fee shortfalls 
of 536,334 for the spring 
semester, anl 5185.000 for 
â–  -fium-ie F -ee**:on6: 



Other deficit Itemft, he 
said, would bring the total 
shortfall for the Fiscal year 
to as mur-h as 5683.93;. 

Turner noted economy 
m pa sure 3 already In- 
stigated by B?.oomIagton 
Ciiincellor Byrum Â£. 
Carter: 

â€” A freeze on all current 
vacancies in faculty, ad- 
ministrative, professional, 
secretarial, and clerical 
positions, 

â€” A freeze on Installa- 
tion of additional tele- 
phon-ris and a review of the 
campu3 telephone system. 

--A line-by-llne review of 
the entire budget to find op- 
portunities for the 
necessary savings. 

â€” Suspension of recruit- 
ment for new or replace- 
ment personnel for the 
1972-73 school year. 

Turner said he did not 
want to sound too pessi- 
m/srlc a note. He added: 
"W hen you consider, 
iiowEver, thar the budger 
w.^3 ai exremf:!/ tight one 
to Starr wfth, and rhat about 
85 per cent of our total 
is already firmly com- 
mitted so ttut the one per 
cent has to comr: out of 
the rem.'j'n.der, you can see 
that it will not be lii easy 
or pleasant job,"

III chancellor cites long range goals 



Efficient utilization of 
existing academic space. 
Stepped-up employment of 
qualified women and 
minorities. Improved 
counseling of students for 
career goals. Increased 
assignment of senior pro- 
fessors to undergraduate 
teaclilng. 

These were some of the 
goals for the school year 
outlined Monday (Oct, 9) 
by Dr. Byrum E. Carter, 
chancellor of Indiana Un- 
iversity at Bloomington In 
the annual "State of the 
Campus" address. 

Carter urged all -depart- 
ments to develop 10-year 
plans in line with the re- 
quest last week by the Ind- 
iana Commission on High- 
er Education for establish- 
ment of long-range goals. 

â– it Is important," he said, 
"that we take steps to Im- 
prove our counseling of 
undergraduate students so 
that they become more 
clearly cognizant of the 
career consequences of 
some decisions a s of 
courses to take and majors 
CO adopt." At the same 
time, he warned ofthedan- 
ger of "going too far.â€žthe 
choice is not either liberal 
ans or career oriented ed- 
ucation. The choice Is one 
of optimum balance." 

He commented that " It 
Is doubtful if one can find 
another major public uril- 
,^yer_sity ili: Which quite such 
large proportion of fresh- 
man or sophomore In- 
struction Is undertaken by 
its regular tenured faculty. 
N evertheless, there ar e 
areas In v;hich this does 
not occur. We shall con- 
tinue to exert pressure to 
correct this sItuatlonlF 

The chancel lor re- 
affirmed plans for estab- 
lishing soon Inter- 
relationship with the Uni- 
versity of Illinois for the 
use of PLATO, a system 
of computer - assisted 
learning program^ based 
there. 

Research, he said, will 
continue to be a major 
facet of the Bloomington 
campus, "The scholar who 
has not engaged in research 
will, over time, have less 
and less to offer In in- 
struction. Our stress is. 
however, on r esearch 
which is oriented to In- 
struction." 

As to faculty recruitment. 
Carter said: "For the last 
two years we have urged 
that every effort be made 
to Increase the number of 
women and minority group â–  
representatives o n our 
faculty. We have stressed 
this not only as a matter 
of significance for women 
or fri norities but as Im- 
portant to our students. 
It Is Important that women 
students and minority stu- 
dents be provided wit h 
models toe mulate. We 
shall continue to press for 
such recruitment." 

The Bloomington carr^ius 
he said, is nearing the end 
of a phenomenal growth 
( from an enrollment of 



17,800 ten years ago to a efficient utilization of 



current 31,280). 
"We must concern our- 
selves, not so much with 
problems of expansion and 
new construction, although 

some nay be necessary, 
as with the problems of 



space and improve nre nsto 
existing facilities, soasto 
enable us to undertake new 
and Innovative approaches 
to teaching and learning.' 
he said.

As of ihis Issue, The Communicator will no longer be 
able lo publish on a regular weekly basis. We cannot

Our decision to cease publication Is not due to finan- 
cial problems. Our 1972-73 budget Is sufficient for our 
needs. 

We simply do not have the staff to put out a paper. 
Resignations received since September 1 have not been 
filled. This issue was put out with a skeleton staff. 
The openings are not all lowar-eschelon Jobs. Many 
are managerial positions. Including that of managing

2101 Coliseum Blvd. East, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46805. 
All newspaper policy and opinion is determined by 
the student editorial staff and does not represent

To the Ed.tor: 

I wish your newspaper 
great success in the cause 
of defending the rights and 
promoting the welfare of 
students at our campus. I 
hope that I may be counted 
among those who do more 
Chan calk abouc humanistic 
values in education. Know- 
ing your concern for the 
interests of students. I am 
saddened by something I 
have read In your news- 
paper, I am referring to a 
recent article about the 
work of Dr. Helen Lee. 
I have known Dr. Lee for 
years, first as one of her 
undergraduate students and 
later as a teacher and 
graduate student. On many 
occasions I have observed 
her work helping students 
become successful 
teachers and helping them 
both find and keep jobs. 

When I was an undergrad- 
uate student Dr. Lee gave 
practical advice to me and 
to my classmates about 
what we could do so that 
prospective employers 
would find us acceptable 
candidates for teaching 
positions. When we were 
student teachers she spent 
many hourstalkingtocrltic 
teachers, consultants, 
principals andadmlnistra- 
tors so that they woulddls- 
cover the best in our per- 
formances and feel con- 
fident of our abilities. In 
private conferenceswithus 
Dr. Lee helped usdiscover 
and correct our weak- 
nesses as prospective 
teachers. If she spoke a- 
bout us to others, she 
mentioned only good 
qualities. When she pre- 
pared her recommenda- 
tions for us, she cave us 
opportunities to tell her 
what we thought should be 
written about us and to see 
what she had written. In 
witlng these recommend- 
ations she continued her 
policy of saying nothing if 
she could not sincerely say 
something good. 

Over and over during my 
student teaching and my 
first year as a teacher I 
was aided by the memory 
of the good sensible advice 
Dr. Lee had given us. The 
burden of learning a new 
job was eased by many 
printed material she had 
given us from herown files 
which p rovlded specific 
lesson ideas and 
suggestions for teaching. 
Since we have been at work 
in the teaching prefession. 
Dr. Lee has helped me and 
many others find positions 
more suitable for our needs 
and quallficacions. All of 
the work Dr. Lee does for 
students requires her time 
and her special ability to 
talk with and u nderstand 
teachers and the work they 
do. I couldn't do what Dr. 
Lee does for people. I 
don't know anyone who 



could. I am fearful ttet 
well - meaning but mis- 
informed critics of her 
work might distract her 
attention fromt he Import- 
ant concern of helping peo- 
ple become teachers and 
become better teachers.

More criticism 



To the Editor: 

I read our weekly news 
publication with interest, 
and I am pleased that the 
editorial staff isconcerned 
about policies, personnel 
and problems which effect 
the student of this campus. 
I do, however, feel that 
The Communicator staff 
should also be responsible 
for a thorough Investiga- 
tion of complaii'its from 
Irate students who use this 
paper as an "anonymous 
mouthpiece' in conducting 
a personal attack on any 
individual, Including staff 
members of I-PU. 

In a recent Issue your 
editorial libelously attack- 
ed a distinguished member 
of lU's Education Division. 
You went so far as to say 
that this instructor was not 
only ineffective as a 
teacher, but that her well- 
deserved piDmDtionto As- 
sociate Professor should 
not have been granted and. 
Indeed, should be in- 
validated. Yourartlclealso 
ostracized Dr. Sharp for 
coming to the defense of 
this instructor. I am writ- 
ing this letter in protest 
to your vlciousness In at- 
tacking both of these peo- 
ple. 

I am sure that every 
teacher will be disliked by 
some students, for one rea- 
son or another; perhaps 
this dislike may even 
develop into contempt. But 
what about thosestudents 
who see the same teacher 
in an opposite manner? 
Should not their opinions 
have been considered be- 
fore a public vendetta was 
administered? I strongly 
resent the role you as- 
sumed in your pretense of 
speaking for all former and 
present students of this in- 
structor. I am one of her 
students, and this woman is 
genuinely concerned about 
developing our maximum 
potentials as future 
teachers, Sheisalso "going 
the second mile" in at- 
tempting to assist us In 
the securing of positions 
upon graduation. I certainly 
do not see why this should 
be considered negatively, 
and indeed, I respect and 
admire her because of her 
dedication and her interest 
in helping me become an 
effective teacher. 

Of course, as a result of 
her Instruction I have 
learned many things about 
myself and my abilities as 
a potential teacher. I have 
been confronted vith my 
weaknesses as well as my 



strengths, and Ic is diffi- 
cult to face an honest 
evaluation of self, it ap- 
pears as If a few of her 
students were not able to 
cope with their self- 
assessmei t, and rather 
than attacking their pro- 
blem positively and at the 
source (within themselves) 
they have responded by at- 
tacking the vehicle by which 
their "hangups' were re- 
vealed {the instructor.) 

I do not believe It is fair 
for The I - PU Com- 
municator to generalize 
upon the personal bias of a 
few disgruntled people 

while totally Ignoring the 
possibility of alternative 
opinions. Students are 
pleading for more 
tolerance, respect a nd 
understanding fromothers, 
especially t achers and 
administrators; but It 
seems to me this is a two- 
way street, and that the 
campus newspaper has a 
responsibility to help pave 
the way.

Doing time at Asfiiand prison 



Peters clarifies 
sexuality stand 



Many people, that Is, 
more than three, have com- 
mented on "Marriage and 
Alienation" thusly, "Ah, 
what Is it exactly that you 
are trying to say?" Let 
me make myself perfectly 
clear, 

I am not saying that the 
restrictlvenesB of mar- 
riage Is not a real prob- 
lem but rather that It Is 
not a real present prob- 
lem. That iB to say, it 
may become a problem at 
some later date, but that 
It will so become only af- 
ter we deal with some more 
basic types of alienation. 
I am claiming that, because 
of the atmosphere of ali- 
enation prevalent in our so- 
ciety (e.g. women's op- 
pression specifically and 



all person's oppression by 
the beaurocratlc system in 
general), we are at this 
time unable to even deter- 
mine whether sexual ex- 
clusivity in marriage is 
a problem at all. 

It Is precisely because 
this is a social and not a 
moral Issue that lamleav- 
Ing open the possibility of 
becoming a problem at 
some future date. Faithful- 
ness has become the whip- 
ping post of marital prob- 
lems, when I suspect our 
restrictive, money-orient- 
ed system is the real cul- 
prit, at least this point in 
time.

On February 2. 1972, 
I was sentenced to six 

months in prison by Fed- 
eral Judge Jesse Eschbach 
for refusal to report for 
Induction into the army. 
Some of Che reasons for 
my act of civil disobedi- 
ence were discussed at 
length In Issues of last 
year's Commijnicator so 
I see no reason to go Into 
them once again. What I 
do want to talk about, how- 
ever. Is the experience of 
prison. 

I did four and one half 
months altogether, having 
been released early on ac- 
count of good behavior. I 
spent 16 days In the Allen 
County Jail and the remain- 
ing four months Inthe Fed- 
eral Youth Center at Ash- 
land, Kentucky. 

The prison at Ashland 
Is a dull, red -bricked 
structure with dormi- 
tories, shops and a large 
recreation yard. The faci- 
lities themselves are not 
cruel-tooklng as are some 
state prisons. In fact, some 
of my visitors said the pri- 
son's appearance reminded 
them of a boys school. The 
only difference seemed to 
be the double fence topped 
and lined with barbed wire 
and a sophisticated elec- 
tronic warning device 
which surrounded the pri- 
son. 

When I was there, the 
prison's population of In- 
mates was approximately 
535. The prison was built 
to accomodate about 470 
Inmates, Out of the 535, 
about 25 were draft re- 
slsters of various Ideal- 
ogles and persuasions. 
Some were paclflcts like 
myself; others were an- 
archists and political ac- 
tivists of a non-pacifist po- 
sition. Still others were 
men with no labels who 
did, usually on their own, 
what they had to do. The 
rest of the Inmate popu- 
lation was comprised for 
the most part of dopers, 
bank robbers and car 
thieves. 

Because of the strains of 
orison life, the structures 
which form a society there 
and the attitudes of each 
inmate was laid base a full 
spectrum of political, so- 
cial, and moral attitudes 
existed there, yet because 
Inmates have to live so 
closely together, a great 
deal of toleration was shown 
toward divergent points of 
view. As long as one "does 
his own time" and does 
not Inform (or "rat" as 
the slang goes) on any- 
one, he has a right to be 
left alone. 

1 dlc| not experience 
much hostility from the 
Inmates or the guards be- 
cause of the nature of my 
charge. Perhaps this was 
due to the number of draft 
resisters who had been in 
and out of the prison be- 
fore I arrived. Resisters, 
for the most part, have 
more education than the 



average inmate and gen- 
erally have their heads to- 
gether about what's hap- 
pening around them. 

An Inmate or a guard 
who Is confronted at length 
and at close quarters by 
such a person nas to re-" 
think soms of his stereo- 
types about resisters be- 
ing cowards, commies, 
weirdos, or "faggots," I 
got the Impression that re- 
sisters had a somewhat ci- 
vilizing effect upon the pre- 
valant Insanity there (al- 
though this effect certainly 
cannot be attributed to the 
resisters alone.) 

For the most part, the 
guards were not overtly 
mean or cruel. 

The prevalent attitude 
seemed to be one of in- 
difference to the human- 
ity of the Inmates. Rarely 
was an inmate treated as 
a man. In fact, some of 
the things which most a- 
dults can do competently 
for themselves were taken 
out of the Inmates' hands. 
In a thousand small subtle 
ways an inmate get the im- 
pression that he Is nobody 
and not worth trusting with 
even a minimum of respon- 
sibility. 

Inmates are reduced to 
asking for things which 
ws on the outside take for 
granted as being our nat- 
ural rights. ("Can I leave 
the unit CO go co the com- 
missary? Can I have a 
roll of toilet paper? a bar 
of soap? some envelopes 
and writing paper? Will 
you call my case worker 
and ask him,..? V/IU you 
unlock the door so I can 
go CO sick call?") I of- 
ten got the feeling that I 
was in one very serious 
life or death gams of "Mo- 
ther, May I." 

Perhaps the most over- 
whelming experience with- 
in the prison situation is 
the sense of oppressive 
confinement. One's alter- 
natives are severely lim- 
ited. Some examples of 
this are those I gave a- 
above where an Inmate's 
control over the simplest 
moments of his life no 
longer exists. Another ex- 
ample Is the utter sense of 
physical limitation. One 
has no space of his own 
for privacy. The routine 
becomes the same. One 
becomes embedded In 
monotony. 

I had a yery hard time 
connecting my act of civil 
disobedience with the con- 
sequences of myact. There 
seemed to be no continuity 
between refusing induction 
and life in prison. My sense 
of solidarity and Identifica- 
tion with a specific comm- 
unity of friends and loved 
ones was cut from under my 
feet since prison Is more or 
less a llmDo devoid of any 
ties with history and time. 
It Is simply a place which 
exists, lacklngcolor and di- 
versity. I have searched for 
ways to make my prison ex- 
periences concrete and 



clear to my family and 
friends. But there seems to 
be no image I can bring forth 
which can carry the full 
weight of imprisonment. 
Days are dull there, almost 
completely empty of sub- 
stance. One day can be sub- 
stituted for another without 
any loss. It Is work to keep 
some sensitivity and gen- 
tleness alive. 

I struggled not to becom; 
bitter or despondent, but 
there were few outlets. 
There Is no laughter with 
mirth. There are no eyes 
with joyousness. Work Is 
meaningless and for the 
most part only assigned to 
keep the Inmates busy for a 
part of the day. Hardly any- 
one ever learns anything of 
worth or of a rehabilitative 
nature. 

Somstlmes I found myself 
wishing it would be bloody 
and plainly evil. It Is not of 
course-and that Is Its uni- 
queness. One can never 
place the responsibility for 
the fatigue and numbness on 
any individual or cause, 
and, therefore, the anger 
that the place causes, the 
resentment and hostility 
which builds' up never goes 
anywhere, never gets purg- 
ed. It festers Inside each 
Inmate. It Is hard to live 
deprived of meaningful sen- 
sory and mental stimula- 
tion. 

Dostoevsky once wrote 
that "the degree of civili- 
zation In any society can be 
measured by entering Its 
prlBOne." Prisons are the 
fleshing out ofourassump- 
tlons concerning the value 
and dignity of people. I 
once cold a friend that pri- 
sons existed because men 
have tried to administer 
justice without love. 

I'm not trying to be self 
righteous. I'm not trying to 
mike myself outa sa mar- 
tyr by saying "look at what 
I went through." But I am 
trying to say "look what 
people In prisons go 
through. What does that 
kind of experience do to 
people who have to go 
through It? And more- what 
kinds of things do we say 
about ourselves as human 
beings when we allow peo- 
ple to go through such ex- 
periences?" 

"Correctional Institu- 
tions", "reformatories", 
"training schools", "youth 
centers" all point to the 
same thing for me. They 
point to the unwillingness 
or inability of a society to 
come to grips with some of 
Its major problems. As long 
as we feel that society's 
problems can be- rectified 
by retribution, as long as we 
feel that "out of sight, out 
of mind" deals wlthaprob- 
lematlc situatln ade- 
quately we will fall to see 
prisons as the degrading, 
destructive, violent places 
that they are and we will 
continue to be blind to our 
own self destruction.

Student Services 



New delayed admission program implemented at I-PU 



An interview with William Chavis, Coordinator of Special Services 



Q: Mr. Chavis, what is 
the function of the Special 
Services Office? 
A; The main purpose that 
I've been concerned with 
the past two or three years 
has been one of research 
and development of a dif- 
ferent kind of program. 
What we're trying to find 
out Is what we can do with 
those students who have 
denied admission, those 
who have been academi- 
cally deficient In some a- 
rea. When I say research, 
I've been to Ball State; 
I've Investigated their 
DASEP program. DASEP 
stands tor Directed Admis- 
sions Student Experimental 
Programs. What It In- 
volves is that It takes all 
students that have been ei- 
ther denied admission or 
are marglnly admitted to 
the university because 
their SAT scores are be- 
low 800, the cut-off point, 
and allows these students 
to enroll in the Univer- 
sity. We will develop a 
special program to see if 
these students can make it 
in college. 

This Is what I've done in 
the area of research, I've 
researched Ball State, what 
they've done. I've re- 
searched the student op- 
portunity program at Mal- 
colm X. Dave Abromowitz 
(engineering professor) 
and I went to Newark Col- 
lege of Engineering and we 
Investigated their engin- 
eering program, I've been 
to Malcolm X to look at 
their program. The Uni- 
versity of Illinois in Cham- 
palne Urbana has a special 
educational opportunity 
program called the FEOP. 
They essentially do the 
same thing. They bring 
students to the university 
that could nor be admitted. 
All of the colleges and 
universities that I've in- 
vestigated have indicated 
that there is a definite need 
for a special program. If 
you bring a student into the 
university that is a good 
mathematician but has no 
English - reading or wri- 
ting skills - then ultimate- 
ly he bombs out of the uni- 
versity through the English 
department what they have 
department. What they 
have done in all the the 
universities I've mentioned 
is to develop a reading- 
writing skills lab. Ball 
State has one that I think 
is the best. Indiana State 
just developed one. I also 
believe that there are 
a number of students 
here on this campus who, 
even though they have been 
admitted regularly to the 
University, still have prob- 
lems say in math or Eng- 
lish and without some sort 
of tutoring program or 
some sort of remediation 
they will ultimately fall... 

Q: So then you are in the 
process of implementing 



similar program at I-PU. 
A: Right, We have al- 
ready done so. We took 
maybe 30 students that have 
been admitted to the Uni- 
versity under special cir- 
cumstances and, rather 
than copy Bali State in dir- 
ective admissions, wehave 
what we call delayed ad- 
missions. We can delay 
their regular admission to 
the University until they 
show that they can suc- 
ceed in college. We allow 
them to take up to 12 hours. 
We try to provide a vari- 
ety of experiences for 
them. Number one, we try 
to incorporate them Into 
this Special Services pro- 
gram, an awareness pro- 
gram, a counseling pro- 
gram, a tutoring program. 
In fact, we do have 10 tu- 
tors that are sociology ma- 
jors working with us. In 
addition to one. Dr. Ulmer 
(Dean of Student Services) 
Donna Brandt (Student Ser- 
vices Counselor) and Chuck 
Bolyard (Director of Stu- 
dent Services Counseling) 
are all working directly 
with the directed admis- 
sions students. 



Psych and soc 

Q: What type of courses 
do these students take? 
A; They are regular aca- 
demic courses. Eighty- 
five per cent have or are 
taking psychology or soci- 
ology. We have more or 
less used the BaU State 
concept of steering them 
away from English until 
we can give them some 
meaningful experience In 
English or writing skills 
program. 

They can come Into the 
University either In Pur- 
due as a non-degree stu- 
dent, they come in unclas- 
sified or they can come 
into lU on probation. We've 
got about five veterans In 
the class. They found that 
they wanted to come to 
school, but they for some 
reason didn't fit. They 
didn't know whatthey want- 
ed to do. They knew that 
they wanted to go to col- 
lege, but maybe couldn't 
commit themselves. So es- 
sentially what we've done 
I've talked to the veterans 
and found out what they've 
wanted to do and. enrolled 
them In some classes. 

Q: How were students se- 
lected for this program? 
A: Well, I reviewed 150 
applicants that were denied 
admission on a regular ba- 
sis with the stipulation 
that. If they could prove 
that they could do regu- 
lar, college work some- 
where else, they would be 
allowed to be enrolled In 
school, I looked at their 
age for instance. Older 
students seem to be bet- 
ter motivated. So on that 
basis I allowed them to 
take part In the prograir 



I looked at their English 
grades and their math 
scores. I somewhat dis- 
regarded the S A T in my 
judgement simply because 
it has been proved to be 
culturally biased. It doesn't 
make any differnece if the 
student is black, white or 
green If the test is cul- 
turally biased, 

I selected them on a 
basis of personal Inter- 
views. We talked about 
counseling, we talked about 
tutoring, we talked about 
their aspirations and their 
wanting to go back to col- 
lege. Most of them in- 
dicated that they had bom- 
bed in high school, they 
played around, had poor 
study habits. Many said 
"I have done a lot of things 
I shouldn't have done and 
now I want a second 
chance," You get some 
pretty good indicators 
through the personal in- 
terview. And the fact that 
they came out was pretty 
important. They may have 
been denied admission, and 
then a week later they get 
a letter from rm saying we 
will allow you to come to 
school under certain cir- 
cumstances. I think 27 of 
the 30 showed up for the 
Interviews, Afterwards I 
selected three more be- 
cause we wanted 30. I 
don't know why 30. 

We don't have the fac- 
ilities and we don't have 
the budget for i larger 
program. 

Two year programs 

Q'. are most of these stu- 
dents people who have had 
previous academic re- 
cords? 

A: You could say that In 
general. There are a lot 
of things that come Into 
play when you think in 
terms of a bad academic 
record. It's hard to know 
what a bad academ?.c re- 
cord is. I think that there 
are reasons why it doesn't 
m^et college standards, 
and in Special Services we 
take a look at the reasons 
why there may have been 
why. There may have been 
social problems, home life, 
personal life, working all 
the time, lack of motiva- 
tion, not really caring. 

A number of students 
have Indicated that they 
don't even want a four- 
year program, they want 
a two-year program. They 
want to eliminate the gar- 
bage. Here's what they 
say: "I don't want to take 
all the courses that are Ir- 
relevant to me. I want 
to get into something now. 
That's what was wrong 
with high school. I took 
classes that didn't make 
sense." This Indicates 
that maybe they want to 
get away from the tradi- 
tional kind of thing. 




Q: What are the voca- 
tional or academic goals 
of these students? 
A: Out of the 30, I can 
give you som^ indicators. 
There are four women that 
want to go into nursing pro- 
grams; there are four 
young men that want to go 
Into sociology; and there 
are two that are In MET 
so far. But you can see 
they're all in a kind of 2- 
year program. There's 3 
that want to major In Eng- 
lish. There's one young 
lady who has already ta- 
ken English this summer. 
She wants to major In Eng- 
lish, and I might say that 
she's done quite well even 
though she had been denied 
admission. 

Q: When did this program 
first admit students? 
A: They were first ad- 
mitted this semester. 

Q: Is it still too early 
for you to get feedback on 
how these students are do- 
ing? 

A: Yes, it's really too 
early. I think that it will 
be too early until after the 
first year of the program. 
Q: Do the experiences at 
other universities indicate 
to you that these students 
will have at least a "nor- 
mal" rate of success at 
I-PU? 

A: Yes, I think so. At 
Ball State out of the 50 
that started, they gradu- 
ated 37, which is better 
than the 50% rate which 
most colleges have. 

I think giving the kids 
meaningful experiences 
and getting them oriented 
to college life Is the key. 
Take for Instance the tu- 
toring thing. We have tu- 
tors for all of our kids. 
Most college freshmen 
don't have tutors. Wehave 
professional counselors 
assigned to the kids. We 
let them know what's go- 
ing on In the University. 
We use The Communica- 
tor to let them know what's 
coming up. We hope we 



are. Giving them an edge 
what we're trying to do Is 
demonstrate that this kind 
of thing Is needed. 

Q: In your counseling ses- 
sions so far, what kind of 
reactions have you had 
from the students? 
A: I have had mixed re- 
actions, typical of any uni- 
versity situation. You have 
some wh o think that if 
they could eliminate some 
of the busy work, aiii^, get 
down to the relevant stuff 
it would be fun. And I've 
had some that say, "This 
is beautiful. This is the 
opportunity for me to get 
It together. This is an op- 
portunity for me to make 
something of myself." I 
think primarily the older 
students act this way. 

Q: Other than the special 
admissions program, what 
else do you do In Special 
Services? 

A: Well, I have been deal- 
ing with some of the vet- 
erans, some of their prob- 
lems. I am In constant 
contact with the V.A, Some 
of the veterans come tome 
about their GI bill or their 
problems with the V.A. 

I have counseled a lot 
of minority students, I 
have. In fact, gone through 
registration with them; I've 
gone through financial aids 
with them. And not just 
minority students but o- 
fher students that come 
through, I guess with the 
minority students there Is 
a feeling of camaraderie, 
they can react to me and 
they can get a straight 
answer. I can't help the 
way that they feel. I'm 
here to help them. 

I have served as a 11- 
ason for black students 
with Che administration on 
different occasions. When 
problem.3 do coms up, and 
we haven't had that many, 
I act as a sort of Uason, a 
moderator.

Student 
Life 



Never doing one of these again! 

by Charlotte Raison 



Last Monday, an or- 
dinary and unsuspecting 
Monday, I was given (or 
somehow I volunteered, I 
don't remember which one 
It was ) the task of inter- 
viewing an "unusual" per- 
son for the paper. 

"Terrific, fantastic I" 
I was thrilled. My big 
break had come. I could 
already envision the Pul- 
itzer Prize and its mone- 
tary reward gripped firm- 
ly and held on to tightly 
by my greedy little pinkish 
fingers. My once-in-a- 
million chance had arrived. 
Was I going to blow It? 
never I 

With these fantasies of 
grandeur evolving in my 
thoughts I strolled easily 
and confidently out of the 
Student Lounge. Yet as 
soon as I left the room it 
struck me I didn't know 
anyone "unusual. " My 
glorious bubble had been 
burst. 

None of my friends could 
fit intothe category of being 
"unusual". Sadly I pic- 
tured the sight of my Pul- 
itzer being snatched up by 
no other than the likes of 
Howard Cosell. 

Friday arrived which of 
course you can guess was 
the deadline. Friday and I 
hadn't even started. Ever 
have one of those days? 
However, even though I 
hadn't written a line I did 
possess a couple of names. 
Around U a.m. in the 
morning I spotted the sec- 
ond person who'd been in 
competition for the honor 
of my questioning. Good 
luck had happened. I would 
have my story {It's not 
yours yet, Howard Cosell 1} 



by Charlotte Raison 

But I had a problem. How 
to approach my Interview- 
ee. I had no intention of 
breaking either Emily 
Post's 'rules or Amy Van- 
derbllt'e (even if I had no 
idea what they were). 

Sitting on the multicol- 
ored seats across from him 
I tried to formulate a plan. 
Somehow I had to trans- 
verse the 20 feet and begin 
the interview. I was ner- 



vous. I knew that the only 
topic the two of UB had In 
common was that we both 
graduated from the same 
high school. (Soms ter- 
rific background! He grad- 
uated several years before 
I did.) "HeUo, I'm from 
the paper and I'm supposed 
to do an article on an un- 
usual person."

The I-PU COMMUNICATOR 



October 13, 1972 



Toffler expresses opinions on today's tlirow away society 



There were more people 
than Beats at the Alvln 
Tqffler convocation held 
Wednesday night on cam- 
pus. The audience, only 
half of which was students, 
had to resort to classroom 
desks crowded IntotheStu-* 
dent Lounge. Introduced 
by Convocations Commit- 
tee member Oble Booker, 
the author of "Future 
Shock" spoke on our "ac- 
celerated society." 

Thle accelerated world 
has caused the birth of 
what Toffler refers to as 
"throw-aways." The lec- 
turer pointed out that there 
Is economic pressure to- 
ward short-term products. 
From the manufacturer and 
consumer's points of view. 
It l6 cheaper to waste many 
products than It Is to re- 
pair or reuse them. 

Therefore, we are flooded 
with throw-aways which 
cause an enormous waste 
disposal problem. The 1- 
ronlc result Is that In the 
end, short-term products 
are really more expensive 
than reusable ones. 

In addition to material 
"throw-aways," the accel- 
erated society also results 
in short-term Interper- 
sonal relationships. We 
see in this country throw- 
away friends and throw- 
away marriages, Toffler 
explained. As an example 
of the accelerated relation- 
ships, Toffler pointed to 
college polls which Indicate 
that couples reach sexual 
Intimacy much sooner than 
in the past. 

The convocation speaker 
â–  said the result of all this 
acceleration Is that Is is 
"asking people to make 
more decisions in shorter 
spans of time." 

There are basically two 
types of decisions a per- 
son must make, Toffler 
explained. The first is 
the routine, habitual type 
response and the second 
is the more complex, non- 
routine type decision such 
as choosing whether or not 
to marry. 

Today there Is a shift 
from uniformity to variety 
and diversity, and because 
of this our culture is rap- 
idly becoming heterogene- 
ous rather than homogene- 
ous. Diversities are being 
more and more accentuatea 
and persons of variouscul- 
tures are finally beginning 
to stand up and be proud 
of their heritages. 

ChoMce^fmedom 

"The more choice an 
Individual has, the more 
freedom he has," said Tof- 
fler. Furthermore, the 
numsrous options present 
today slow down our deci- 
sion-making. 

Future Shock affects de- 
cision-making probability 
and therefore affects im- 
portant decisions made on 
subjects such as ecology, 
race, and the war, Toffler 
believes. 
'!#.Â».M.Â«.i.i,*-Â».u*.u:*:t(;&lt;Â«v*vÂ«'Â»vr. 



The secret to this ac- 
celerating society lies in 
today's education, Toffler 
points out. Only through 
participation In the pro- 
cess of change are stu- 
dents able to learn this 
secret. This type of ed- 
ucation Is being Initiated 
at universities all over the 
country, where action cur- 
riculums are being stres- 
sed whereby students re- 
ceive on-the-job experi- 
ence along with classroom 
learning. 

Toffler suggests that we 
again open up the question 
of values In our society. 
"We need to encourage 
speculation about the fu- 
ture," said Toffler. 

The one-hour, l5-mlnute 
talk was brought to a close 
by a brief question-answer 
period. Following his ap- 
pearance at Indiana-Pur- 
due, Toffler headed for the 
Fort Wayne Press Club, 
where he held a press con- 
ference. His lecture was 
the second Convocations 
Comrn.'.ttee program of the 
year.

C ha vis interview. 



(Con't from p. 6) 

I have tried to stimulate 
motivation for some stu- 
dents that get an attitude 
about a class or a teacher 
and just refuse to go- to 
class. I try to mediate the 
problem between the stu- 
dent and the professor. 

I get the two together 
and they resolve their 
problems. This has hap- 
pened and it will happen 
again. In fact, I have an 
appointment to rap with 
some English profs about 
some things that go on In 
class. 

Q: What do you see in 
the future for Special Ser- 
vices? 



Well, ru tell you. If 
this goes like I want It 
to go, I think Special Ser- 
vices will probably be the 
fastest growing area In the 
area of Student Services. 



For this reason, I think 
the more we demonstrate 
that students do need spec- 
ial services for academic 
deficiencies, for coun- 
seling, tutoring and test- 
ing services and get away 
from the more traditional 
types of things, I think the 
students wlU begin to real- 
ize... 

I can see Special Ser- 
vices developing all kinds 
of programs basically In 
the reading and writing 
skills areas. Because if we 
don't test them we don't 
know what areas the stu- 
dent is deficient In. Many 
people feel, well If they 
can't cut It In college they 
don't belong here. And I 
don't feel this way. Be- 
cause If a student Is an 
engineer and we have a 
number of students that 
graduate that still can't 
read or read on a third 
grade level. This has been 
proved by a study at New- 
ark here you've got an en- 
gineer graduate that can't 
read. Special Services also 
says to me If you turn out 



engineering you should take 
an area that overlaps. Just 
don't take straight engin- 
eer courses - take a lit- 
tle sociology, a little hu- 
manity so that the student 
will be more prepared for 
society. For Instance, we 
have an apartment complex 
in Fort Wayne that was de- 
signed by an engineer to be 
housing for multi-problem 
family, the unwed mother, 
all other sociological prob- 
lems. Then the en^neer 
develops a project set up 
for large, low Incomefam- 
Illes that has one bathroom 
on the second floor. The 
same thing happened In 
Chicago. They have high- 
use complexes of this kind 
where they neglect to build 
a bathroom on the first 
floor so that a boy who 
lives on the 14th floor has 
to go all the way up to 
his floor to use the bath- 
room. So that tells you 
something about the guys 
who designed these pro- 
jects. These are things 
that the engineer needs to 
understand. He needs soms 
sort of sociology program 



so that he can see more than 
just one and one are two 
and will always be two. 
This is the area that Spec- 
ial Services can point up. 
We got to say we got to 
have some overlap, some 
cross-cultural things In- 
volved.

Music notes 

Band's Rock 
of Ages 
amazing 

by Dave Hill 

Snooky Young, Howard 
Johnson, Joe Farrel, Earl 
Mclntyre and J.D. Parron. 
Never heard of 'em? Prob- 
ably not, unless you've al- 
ready bought "Rock of 
Ages" by The Band. 

These are the names of 
the musicians In the horn 
section used by The Band 
on this album. "Rock of 
Ages" is a live album re- 
corded last New Year's Eve 
at New York's Academy of 
Music. This was the first 
time The Band had used 
a horn section, although 
Garth Hudson can play wind 
Instruments besides key- 
boards. The effect is a- 
mazing. The horns add 
a lot of depth to all the 
songs. (Most of which are 
previously recorded Band 
numbers.) 

There are virtually no 
horn solos on the album 
(with the exception of a 
sax solo bv Hudson). The 
horns blend together to 
give The Band's music a 
new dimension. 

The songs on this record 
are a representation of 
many different types of mu- 
sic: jazz, rock, folk, blues, 
country, dixieland, etc. 
t*. On first listening to this 
album, I got the overall 
impression that the music 
was very mellow and sub- 
dued. Well, it can be mel- 
low and subdued If you are 
playing it in the background 
while doing something else. 
But just slip on some head- 
phones and turn up the vol- 
ume about the fourth time 
you listen to It. The Band 
Is so tight that you .might 
never notice all the great 
little riffs, vocal inflec- 
tions, and mlni-soIos on 
this record, without head- 
phones. 

Side one of the two- 
record set features "Don't 
Do It," "King Harvest," 
"Caledonia Mission," 

"Get Up Jake." and "W.S. 
Walcott Medicine Show" 
that starts the audience 
cheering in the middle of 
the song. 

The first side that caught 
my ear was side two. It 
starts off with Stage Fright, 
which contains some beau- 
tiful organ, chen moves to 
"The Night They Drove Old 
Dixie Down." The Band 
does this song much bet- 
ter than Joan Baez. I 
never did like the idea of 
her singing "Virgil Kane 
is my name,..." This is 
followed by "Across the 
Great Divide," "Wheelson 
Fire," and "Rag Mama 
Rag." All of these are 
excellent. 

The recording Is very 
good, especially consider- 
ing the face that the music 
was performed live. All 
the songs get better every 
time I listen to the album. 
I would say that The Band 
has gained a new fan.

SPORTS tf ^,1 
SCENE. J^'^T^t'o/t/ 



Blackout controversy rages 



In the paa , Congress ha s 
been more than friendly to 
the professional sports In- 
dustry In this country. Pro 
football, baseball, basket- 
call, and hockey commis- 
sioners and owners have 
enjoyed almost an entirely 
free hand In solving the 
affairs of their sport. One 
of the stiffest challenges 
to come up recently con- 
cerned baseball's reserve 
clause which bonds a player 
to the one club which holds 
the "rights" to he services. 
This challenge was un- 
successful in Congressand 
in the high courts but Is 
still on appeal. 

The present controversy 
contesting the so-called 
professional sports 
"monopoly" concerns the 
subject of television black- 
outs. For " those not 
familiar with the term or 
Its meaning, a blackout 
essentially refers to the 
act of not televising a game 
in the town In which It Is 
played. Several anti-black- 
out bills are being consid- 
ered by a Senate com- 
munications subcomiiittee 
which is presently con- 
ducting hearings on the 
liflsue^jrhfc main target of 
me pflBHmfe legl slatlon - 
pro football. 

One ofthemainarguments 
for maintaining the black- 
out is that. If the game is 
televised in the city where 
It is being played, many 
potential paying customers 
will simply decide to stay 
home and watch the tilt in 
In the comfort of their own 

Think about it 

Frank Howard, forma" 
Clemson head football 
coach, on ex- Alabama 
Coach Wallace Wade: "He 
was to tough that he gave 
the captain 10 laps If he 
lost the coin toss." 

Upton Bell, New England 
Patriots' general manager- 
"I kind of enjoyed the one 
day Duane Thomas qi ent 
in camp with us. We sat 



living room. Thus In a few 
years there would no longer 
be any sellouts which are 
so comnD n today. OneNFL 
team owner testified at the 
hearings that if blackouts 
are disallowed h Is weekly 
attendance would drop by 
as much as 15,000, a 
happening that would toss 
his franchise into the red. 

Commissioner Pete 
Rozelle feels that the tele- 
vision viewer Is not entitled 
to free football entertain- 
ment as if It were a gift 
from H eaven. Com- 
missioner Walter Kennedy 
of the NBA and Don V. 
Ruck, vice-president ofthe 
National Hockey League, 
agree that when the public 
knows a game will be on 
television there Is a real 
risk of loss of gate re- 
ceipts. 

Enter Vance Hartke. 
Vance blasted the NFL's 
assumption that they should 
be permitted to use the 
public airwaves to pro- 
tect their pocketbooks. 

Enter Senator Pastore of 
Rhode Island who claims 
that pro football owes the 
public something. After all, 
says he, it Is the public 
and the television Industry 
who have made football 
"the darling of the sports 
fan In this country." 

All that has been resolved 
Is the fact that Commis- 
sioner Rozelle will "think 
about" a P astore sug- 
gestion that the NFL ex- 
periment with local home- 
game telecasts to see what 
happens. 



on our haunches beside the 
field and he t alked about 
the sunset and how life 
would be in New Zealand." 

Dan Pastorlnl, Houston 
Oilers' QBâ€” 'I throw right- 
handed, but I do almost 
everything else left - 
handed. That Is, every- 
thing but eat spaghetti. That 
I do with both hands."

Bolinger ^-apathy is 
big atliletic problem ' 



Since 1969 the coordinator 
of athletics at I-PU has 
been James R. Bolinger. 
Originally from Ada, Ohio, 
Bolinger attended Ohio 
Northern University where 
along with obtaining his 
teaching degree he lettered 
In both football and track. 
With this background he 
took over the athletic de - 
partment here with the 
responsibility of organ- 
izing a solid sports pro- 
gram for the University. 

This has not been an .easy 
task. Bolinger states that 
convincing students to 
participate in the activities 
now being offered has been 
a stumbling block. Most 

students either work part- 
time or spend their spare 
time away from school. To 
arouse these students' in- 
terest the athletic depart- 
ment has created the best 
intraumural and varsity 
sports program possible. 

This program Isoneofthe 
best programs being offer- 
ed by city colleges In Fort 
Wayne. Presently, flag 
football Is the intraumural 
sport being offered. Eight 
teams participate in the 
bone-jarring contests at 
City Utilities Park across

from the campus. These 
action - packed Sunday 
afternoon contests are 
sometimes played with a 
determination that rivals 
major college competition. 
The game Is of flag-foot- 
ball variety and Is played 
on a 4 by 80 football 
field. Two games are held 
at once so a choice i s 
offered to all spectators 
viewing the sport. Fans are 
encouraged to attend free- 
of - charge. 

Soccer and tennis are now 
being offered on the varsity 
level. Soccer, a relatively 
new sport to this area Is 
fast gaining in recognition 
and popularity. Several 
teams have sprung up In 
this area both In and out 
of schools. The school team 
practices three nights a 
weel and plays two games 
a week. There are still a 
few openings on the team. 
Tennis has been around 
for many years and is a' 
well-established sport in 
Fort Wayne. The hard- 
charging varsity plays area 
college teams each week. 
Both of these sports will 
be gone Into greater depth 
in future feature articles. 
Future hopes for sports 
at I-PU Include athletic 
scholarships, better class 
scheduling for participating 
athletes, and better play- 
ing facilities. With athletic 
scholarships and better 
class scheduling athletes 
would be allowed an easier 
time accldemically and 
would beallowedmoretlme 
for practice. This would 
Improve the caliber of 
teams at the extentlon and 
thereby create a better 
school image. 
A distant future personal 
,hope of Bolinger' s would 
be a tackle football teanru 
This of course would take 
a lot of planning and also 
a lot of money. Given time 
it could be a feasible idea. 
Since Che team would play 
on Saturdays, It would not 
compete with the high 
school football games 
which are a big highlight 
in this city. In time It 
would also earn money for 
the. school in the form of 
ticket returns and vendor 
returns.

Tennis, everyone? appropriate 
on Indiana- Purdue campus 



Tennis, anyone? That 
comedy line wae delivered 
In the 20's by the young 
Humphrey Bogart, In A- 
merica today the line ' 'Ten- 
nlB, everyone?" would be 
more appropriate as mill- 
Ions of Americans of all 
ages, classes, and colors 
take to the courts. 

The number of outdoor 
tennts facllllieB are in- 
creasing by almost 5000 a 
year, and the indoor courts 
have doubled since 1969. 
Tennis is the fastest grow- 
ing participant sport of the 
'70' s. 
The interest in tennis is 
growing at the Indiana-Pur- 
due at Fort Wayne campus, 
also, and with that growth 
comes a real need for ten- 
nis facilities. 

Di. Benjamen Becker, 
associate professor of cell 
and micro-biology is co- 
coach of the newly formal 
varsity tennis team. He and 
co-coach Dr. Charles Bol- 
yard, director of Academic 
Development and Couneel- 
Ing| are only two of n^ny 
faculty, administration, 
and students who feel the 
necessity of tennis courts 
and instructlonsat Indiana- 
Purdue. 

Dr. Becker recently 
stated, "As far astennisis 
concerned. It Is a sport that 
is booming alloverthe 



country. Local courts are 
just filled. Because of the 
fact that we have commut- 
ing students it would be nice 
to have courts on campus. 
That way when a student has 
a couple of hours between 
classes he can go right out 
to the courts," 

The 15 member tennis 
team Is now practicing for 
a limited time period on the 
Lion's 2 public courts. The 
coach cited these facilities 
as being very limited. 

Dr. Becker would like to 
see approximately oneacre 
of campus land alloted to 8 
all-weather tennis courts. 
He said, "These courts 
could be used for the inter- 
collegiate teams, thelntra- 
mural teams, the com- 
munity, plus just interested 
individuals from the Uni- 
versity, We have volunteers 
who like to Instruct others 
in tennis on beginners, in- 
termediate, and advanced 
levels," 

He commented that the 
positive effect that tennis 
courts and facilities would 
have on I-PU is just over- 
whelming. "Tennis oncanv 
pus will draw s tudents to 
enroll here who would 
otherwise attend another 
campus. I know of one stu- 
dent who is going to school 
here this year because of 
the availability of the ten-

nls team," 

Drs. Becker an d Bolyard 
and their tennis team are 
not the only ones actively 
trying to furthur this sport 
on campus. 

Acommittee of students, 
faculty, and administrators 
is now being formed by 
those interested to get ac- 
tion on the building of 
courts on campus. 

The committee will hope- 
fully work with the admini- 
stration to first get land 
allotted for the courts and 
then raise funds for tennis 
facilities.

{Con't from p. 7) 

Beginning my first ques- 
tion was "Do you consider 
yourself an unusual per- 
son? If so, why; if not, 
why not? 

The answer was given 
by many passersby and ac- 
quaintances, and supplied 
by Gibson himself. "Allt- 
tle weird but not "unu- 
sual"'. "Unique, but not 
unusual." "Strangel" 

He asked me what was 
next. At that point I knew 
the interview was going to 
be ruined. I had no other 
questions (O.K. Howard, 
it's yoursi) I had hoped 
and prayed that a brilliant 
conversation woulddevelop 
from my opening question. 
I was too nervous and felt 
too nervous and feh like a 
fool. My plan was a fail- 
ure. I couldn't think of a 
thing to ask (I wanted to 
get the hell out of there. 
I wanted to cry on my best 
friend's shoulder,) and my 
Interviewee seemed bored 
and uninterested , After 
moments of useless chit- 
chat and with a promise 
from Gibson that he would 
write an account of lilsprl-
