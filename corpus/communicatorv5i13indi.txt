INDIANA - PURDUE COMMUNICATOR 




I.U. faculty opposes 
'affiliated' candidates 



By MARK FRANKE 

A resolution instructing their 
representatives on the super-chancel- 
lor search and screen committee to 
"oppose any candidate presently or 
previously affiliated with Indian or 
Purdue Universities" was adopted 
unanimously by the Indiana Faculty 
Senate in a meeting held Tuesday, 
November 13. 

Prior to considering the resolu- 
tion, the Senate voted to open its 
membership to all I.U. faculty who 
wish to participate in its delibera-

Academic chiefs discuss 
super-chancellor with faculty 



By MARK !■ It \.\Kh 



the Indiana and Purdue chief acad- 
emic officers as they addressed a 
joint meeting of all Indiana-Purdue 
faculty and staff last Friday, Novem- 
ber 9, in the Lecture-Recital Hall of 
Neff Hall. Representing the central 
university administrations were Dr. 
J. Gus Liebenow, vice-president and 
dean for academic affairs for Indiana 
University, and Provost Harold F. 
Robinson of Purdue University. 

Both Liebenow and Robinson 
emphasized the commitment of their , 
respective universities to rapid unifi- 
cation of the two sectors of IU-PU. 
"We want to make smooth the 

here," said Robinson. He added that 
the faculty should move quickly in 
considering the problems of unifica- 

Acknowledging that there would 
be many obstacles to overcome 

before unification could be achieved, 



super-chancellor would need to be 
"away and running with a unified 
campus and a unified budget" by July 
1, 1974. 

The two also announced the 
composition of the search and screen 
committee to be formed to nominate 
candidates for the position of super- 



3 students from the IU 
Fort Wayne sector to be appointed by 
IU President John W. Ryan; four 
faculty, one administrator, and two 
students from the Purdue Fori Wayne 
sector, to be appointed by Purdue 
President Arthur G. Hansen; two 
representatives of the Fort Wayne 
community, to be appointed jointly by 



Student loans 
open to 
students 



A large amount of National Direct 
Student Loans is available to all 
students enrolled with Purdue Uni- 
versity for the spring semester 
according to Bill Arnold, financial 
aids director. 

Any Purdue student who can 
show financial need is urged to apply 
immediately An Indiana student who 
needs financial assistance for spring 
also should apply. However, it was 
t known how long there would be 



the two presidents; and one repre- 
sentative each from the central 
administrations of the two universi- 

The central administration mem- 
bers of the committee will be 
Liebenow and Robinson. 

The IU faculty members will be 
selected from a list of ten names 
nominated by the Indiana Faculty 
Senate or IU-PU. The Purdue Faculty 
Senate will have input for the 
appointment of the Purdue faculty 
appointees, and the Students' Govern- 
ment will be utilized in selecting 
students. 

A tentative deadline of March 1, 
1974, was set for the committee to 
finish its work, but Robinson warned 
that this date may be moved up by the 
two presidents because of the urgency 
of naming the super-chancellor. 

Liebenow said that no restrictions 
were being placed on the committee 
prior to its beginning the search. This 
would dispel rumors that the presi- 
dents had agreed that the super- 
chancellor must come from outside 
either university system and would 
open the door for the consideration of 



dean and director of 
Purdue here, as possible candidates. 
The new super-chancellor will 
report directly to the two presidents, 
presumably circumventing the reg- 
ional campus administrations of both 
systems. Liebenow suggested that the 
post will be on a par with the 
chancellorships at the Bloomington 
and Indianapolis campuses. 



The 



super-chancellor will 
both the Chancellor of 
Indiana and the Dean and Director or 
Purdue as administrative head of 
IU-PU. 

Faculty suspicion of the motives 
behind the super-chancellor decision 
became evident during the question 
and answer period. Dr. Marthe 
Rosenfeld, associate professor of 
French, complained that the decision 
was made without consultation with 
the IU-PU faculty. She suggested that 
all the alternatives were not ade- 
quately considered. 

Her views were echoed by other 
professors. Dr. Joseph A. Lavely, 
associate professor of business ad- 
ministration, thought that the super- 
chancellor decision was made to stifle 
the movement for independence. "It 
( the decision) seemed to have evolved 
very rapidly after the Keenan Report 
became public," Lavely said. 

The Keenan Report, released 
approximately one month ago, pro- 
posed complete independence from 
the two universities as the manage- 
ment ideal for the Fort Wayne 
Campus. 

Both Liebenow and Robinson 
disputed the claim that it was the 
Keenan Report that prompted the 



presidential agreement, They indica- 
ted that there have been high-level 
discussions regarding the future of 
IU-PU since the campus first opened 
in 1964. A super-chancellor concept 
has figured prominently in these 
discussions, especially since the 
announcement of the retirement of 
Chancellor Broyles. 

Provost Robinson reiterated the 
line of command to be in effect for 
financial decisions. The new business 
manager wUl report directly to the 
super-chancellor on fiscal matters. 

He will report to the Treasurer of 
the Board of Trustees of Purdue 
University in his role a 
the local campus. The 
serves by law as guardian ot the 
funds. This includes primarily the 
responsibility for investing excess 

Much criticism has been leveled 
at the present Purdue structure, 
which places the business office 
outside the regular administrative 
hierarchy. The chief business officer 
of Purdue reports to the Board of 
Trustees and not to the president. 

Although Purdue will be the fiscal 
agent for IU-PU, the Fort Wayne 
business manager will not report 
through the established Purdue chain 
of command. 

Concern was voiced by faculty 
and staff members over the effect 

benefit packages. Both Liebenow and 
Robinson said that these were 
matters that could be resolved upon 
recommendation of joint study com- 
mittees. They suggested that the 
faculty begin immediately the 



helluva lot of 
problems to solve," Robinson told the 
faculty. He suggested that they be 
well on the way to solving these 
problems by the time the new 
super-chancellor takes office. 

" ' If there is agreement on a 
unified approach, let's move quick- 
ly," he added. Even with the positions 
held by Broyles and Manges being 
phased out, there is still sul'f ic-it-nf 
leadership at IU-PU to move forward 
toward unification, according to 
Robinson. 

Liebenow said that the IU 
Regional Campus Administration has 
been in the process of "phase-down" 



for 



This 



slowed by initiation by the General 
Assembly of single line-item budgets 
for each campus When asked how 
IU-PU will relate lo IU RCA, he 
responded: "We assume that Fort 
Wayne after July 1 will no longer be 
inolved with RCA." 

Robinson indicated that there will 
also be "appropriate adjustments" 
made in the Purdue RCA offica upon 
the retirement of Vice-President 
Charles H. Lawshe this next summer. 



The action by the I.U. Senate 
greatly decreased the chances of such 
prominantly mentioned candidates as 
Roger J. Manges, dean and director 
of Purdue here, and Sylvia E. 
Bowman, chancellor of regional 
campuses for Indiana University. 

Commenting on the significance 
of the faculty vote, Michael C. Downs, 
assistant professor of political 
science, said, "We would like to see a 
real search for new talent, and not 
accept a package that has been 
around awhile." 

Emphasizing that he is not 
denying the existence of talent at

up-dated document on the 
super-chancellor, will be considered 
in today's meeting. 

Brock R. Able, president of the 
student body, indicated that the 
student members of the committee 
would not automatically disqualify 
present associates of IU-PU from 
consideration. 

Officials in the Students' Govern- 
ment did indicate, however, that 
those candidates with previous or 
current affiliation would have a 
difficult time convincing the student 
representatives that this affiliation 
was a matter of the past. 

Students, as well as faculty

faculty and student leaders 

This determination was described 
by Dwight F. Henderson, chairman of 
the Division of Arts and Sciences: " 
lot is going to depend on that 
chancellor. If he is independent, he 
can get a lot of things done Cut Un- 
ties and we've got great possibilities 

"If you get a company man, 
you've got problems." 

In disagreement with the faculty 
on the issue of past affiliation is Ralph 
E. Broyles, chancellor of I.U, here "I 
can see the advantage of having 
someone who carries some knowledge 
of the situation." 

Broyles did admit that such a 
person would be suspect by many of 
the groups on campus because of his 
past activities "This is only human 
nature," said Broyles. 

Apparently agreeing with Broyles 
are the two university presidents, 
John W. Ryan of Indiana and Arthur 
G, Hansen of Purdue. According lo 
their representatives, who were on 
campus one week ago to answer 
(acuity questions, I he presidents have 
placed no restrictions on the search 
and screen committee. This has been 
generally interpreted to mean that 
they wish no one to be eliminated 
from consideration. 

Even with the presidents estab- 
lishing no restrictions, the committee 
mev establish some of its own. 
According to Manges, the committee 
will have to determine its procedures

p.m. in the Student Union Ballroom, 
according to James R. Bolinger, 
IU-PU athletic director. 

The clinic will be conducted by 
Alice Thomas, cheerleading captain 
of this year's squad. The duties of 
cheerleaders, and various exercises 
and routines will be discussed. 

The actual try-outs will be held on 
November 26, 1973, at 7 p.m. in the

Center needs 
funds, supplies 



Nancy Getzin, director of the 
Drop-In Child Care Center at Indiana- 
Purdue, emphasized the center's 
immediate need for donations of 
money and supplies in a recent 



The center went into operation at 
the beginning of this semester to 
facilitate students and staff members 
who are in need of child care services. 

The center is partially funded by 
the Students' Government but the 
amount allotted for expenses and 
supplies is failing far short of the 

"There have been lots of time and 
supplies contributed by many people 
and we are very grateful. However, 
there are many things that we still 

"We still need some large things 
for the classrooms, such as easels, tea 
tab les, a child's rocker. We would 
like to have more toys for our doll 
comer, such as a sink, a cupboard, a 
high chair, and a carriage. We also 
need more dolls and dob* clothes." 



Mrs. Getzin noted that the 
university has been extremely coop- 
erative and helpful in many facets 
regarding the child care center. 



"We have received a lot of help 
from the people in the Buildings and 
Grounds Department. They have 
helped us to install equipment such as 
the cribs and the table and chairs. 
They have really been great. 

"The Learning and Resource 
Center has bent over backwards to 
help us. They have loaned us 
equipment and provided laminating 
and processing of slides." 

Others from the university that 
have served the center are the Health 
Center and the cafeteria. 

Several academic departments 
have been working with the center on 
a consultive basis 

On a different note, Mrs. Getzin 
asked that all students and staff 
interested in using the center during 
the spring semester should register as 
soon as they know their spring 
schedules. 



Other needs mentioned were 
sturdy cars and trucks, wooden 
puzzles, table games, books, records, 
and rhythm instruments. 

"We need monetary donations in 
order to provide snacks for the 
children and art supplies such as clay, 
paints, chalk, .tape, paper, glue, 
pencils, and markers." 

"We also have to buy paper cups, with its facilities.

A CHANGING WORLD 



Faculty challenge 

"You've got one helluva lot of problems to solve," Purdue Provost 
Harold F. Robinson told the IU-PU faculty last week. Robinson went on to 
suggest that they begin immediately their study of these problems to the 
unification of academic programs here. 

The faculty does have its work cut out for it as it considers unifying 
the separate Indiana and Purdue faculties presently existing on this 
campus. 

This fall has witnessed many professors stating that the local 



faculties ought to be united a 
admirable. 



Their logic was clear and their goal 



They accused the central i 
this unification through n 
on the Fort Wayne Campus. 

The advent of this super-chancellor agreement, however has posed 
the possibility of a unified raculty. The administrations have indicated 
their willingness to accept such unification. 

Many professors are skeptical of the good faith of the two central 
administrations. They fear that the presidents will step in and veto 
unification moves. 

This may be true, but it is the responsibility of the faculty to prove 
first their desire for unification, then the good faith of the 
administrations. The problems that do exist can be resolved through local 
effort. 



IU-PU ignores 
'no smoking' 



By REX PUTT 

Webster's College Edition Dict- 
ionary defined a university as, "an 
educational institution of the highest 
level." Toentera university a person 
must have a high school diploma or 
the intellect to pass tests that would 
measure a persons knowledge of high 
school graduation level. One of the 
prerequisites mandatory for passing 
high school is that the student should 
be able to read; so if one attends 
Indiana-Purdue University it's only 
reasonable to assume that he can 
read, right? In order to read it is 
sometimes quite handy to be able to 
spell also. Everyone must be able to 
spell a word before thev can read it. 
All of this double talk might seem 
ridiculous, but unfortunately many of 
the students, faculty, and staff at 
Indiana-Purdue are having difficulty 
with spelling or reading or maybe 
with both. Something should be done 
to help these pitiful intellects. 

Even though it might be a 
worthless effort, I am concerned 
enough about this problem, that I feel 
obligated to help these people with 
their reading and spelling deficien- 

Assuming that everyone knows 
all of the letters of the alphabet, I will 
begin the lesson with several easy 
words that are often seen together 
posted on little plaques in many 
rooms and hallways throughout the 
campus buildings These two simple 
words are often found in the front of 
the rooms, and above doorways, 
i be easily s 



N-C 



the first word. No means 
not ever, not in any degree, not at all. 
This is a very easy word to spell and 
understand- The second word is much 
more difficult, but I believe that 
college students and professors are 
capable of comprehending this word. 
S-M-O-K-I-N-G spells smoking, and it 
can be defined as the process of 
drawing srao!:^ ' or from cigarettes, 
cigars, and pipes into u.e mouth and 
often into the lungs, and blowing it out 

These words now have been 
properly defined and spelled for the 
benefit of those who have always 
wondered what they meant. They can 
conveniently be linked together to 
form the common phrase, "No 
smoking." Has anyone ever seen 
these words together? Maybe the 
smoke in the rooms obscures the view 
of these prominent white letters on a 
dark background. 

A recent letter to Ann Landers 
might help to express my point, if it 
hasn't been obviously expressed 
already. This letter concerns a 
previous letter written by a smoker, 
who was hooked and pleaded for 
understanding. 

"You say you wheeze and cough 
and suffer like hell? Well, I do, too, on 
buses and trains, and in theatres, 
churches, elevators and dozens of 
places where "No Smoking" signs are 
clearly in evidence. But you smoke 
anyway. 

"You ask us to love you. For 
what? Spoiling our meals in restaur- 
ants while you cough, hack and spit, 
gurgle and blow smoke all over the 



rooms and hospitals? You want o 
sympathy because you are killing 
yourself, so go ahead, but please dont 
kill me. I am not emphathetic in 
Caldwell, Ohio." 

Ann Landers' answer was, "Move 
over-you have plenty of company." 



out of the English language. Amidst 
the coughing and smoke-filled atmos- 
phere of a room legally off limits to 
smokers, one begins to wonder about 
tobacco as a major pollutant. Since 
(according to a Census Bureau 
compilation cited by Dr. Harry 
Swartz, a New York City allergist and 
internist,) there was in a recent year, 
seven billion cigars and 573 billion 
cigarettes combausted into the air, 
wouldn't this qualify tobacco as a 
r pollutant? 



abide by. 

Surgeon General Jesse L. Stein- 
feld in his 1972 report "The Health 
Consequences of Smoking," acknow- 
ledged that other people's smoking is 
"exacerbating respiratory allergies 
in children and adults; is retarding 
fetal growth and increasing the 
incidence of premature birth; and is 
causing acute irritation and taxing 
hearts and lungs of non-smokers by 
loading the air in smoke-filled rooms 
with carbon monoxide, the deadly 
poison found in auto exhaust." 

The non-smoker has the right to 
breathe fresh air, especially in a room 
that prohibits smoking. The "NO 
SMOKING" signs aren't strategically 
placed for decoration. If this was a 
state institute for the mentally 
retarded it could be understood (that 
the rules might be disobeyed i, but it's 
a university, which is defined as "an 



Hate dominates Mideast conflict 



By JOHN PINKERMAN 

When the Jews and the Arabs 
fight it is the inevitable climax of an 
impossible situation, jmust as the 
years of fighting between the Cathol- 
ics and Protestants of Northern 
Ireland is an impossible situation. 

The Irish are years away from a 
settlement of a very simple problem - 
and they kill with unbelievable 
cruelty day by day, week by week, 
month by month, year by year. The 
situation in the Israeli-Arab shooting 
is worse - it goes back centuries. 

I remember well a most jj|e;isant 
dinner of 1954 in Ankara, Turkey, 
when and Egyptian diplomat volun- 
teered lo show me the Turkish capital 
at night - long after midnight. It 
semecl strange that this man would 
extend such courtesy to a visiting 
newsman but I accepted because I 
was to be in the city a short time. Soon 
I learned with it was all about - he 
hated Jews and he thought the name 
Pinkerman was Jewish and he 
wanted to tell me off concerning the 
"Jewish problem" in Palestine. I 
enjoyed his conversation and I 
enjoyed his tour, but the depth of his 
hatred for Jews, later lo be known 
nationally as Israelis, was something 
to behold. 

More recently, not even a year 
ago, I made a news trip to Israel. I 
had occasion to see the biggest Golan 
Heights battle with the Syrians since 
the Six-Day War of June, 1967 - until 
the new war came along. I then 
learned to understand firsthand the 
feeling of the Israelis. 

And, that's where the problem is 
-- the deep-seatd, irreconcilable 
enmity between these peoples. 

Regardless of the result of this 
new war, there will be another, and 
another, and another, and another. It 
is just like the situation in Ireland - 
and it will continue to be a blight on 
the natural urge of people to get along 
with each other for years beyond your 
and my time. 



The reasons are complex, and 
they are simple. Arabs hate the 
Israelis because in their minds, and 
this is a genuine asessment to them, 
the Israelis stole their land in the 
United Nations establishment of 
Israel as a nation in November, 1947. 
Also, the Arabs are afraid of the 
Israelis, and well they might be. The 
Jews have whipped them to three 



s up to now and devastated them 
in the Six-Day War. 

However, the Arabs by nature 
seem to love to fight losing causes and 
that is part of the reason why this new 
conflict is under way. 

They have lost territory they have 
no good reason to think they should 
recover. The Golan Heights is one

Much of this attitude develops from

merely an extension in death-deliver-

different. They long were without a

dominant force in the Middle East 
centuries ago. They lives through an 
impossible British mandate situation 
until the United Nations made its 
historic move, and they are not about 
to budge an inch Up to now, although

Bottle bill perils profits 



By ( 



V. RITTER 




Environmental legislation, espec- 
ially that passed by communities and 
states, will play an increasingly 
important role in corporate profit 
capability in numerous industries for 
years to come, judging from early 
evidence. 

Effects of a bill passed by Oregon 
two years ago are just beginning to be 
felt. Marketing and security analysts 
in beverage and container industries 
are watching closely. It is the 
so-called Oregon Bottle Bill, estab- 
lishing a mandatory deposit and 
refund system applying to all beer 
and soft drink containers sold in the 
state. It may be expanded to cover 
wine, whisky and other container 

the object, of course, is to reduce 
litter, thereby enhancing the state's 
natural beauty. 

A study by an impartial observer 
from outside the state has turned up 
rather interesting facts and indica- 
tions. In the first place, states H. 
Edward Schollmeyer, research anal- 
yst for the firm of Mitchell, Hutchins, 
Inc., it appears that "the bottle bill is 
beginning to achieve its objective of 
reducing litter." It isn't just the 
'effect of the bill itself, he feels. 



Consumers are more educated about 
litter and the state has a youth corps 
and "litter policemen" - 320 in all - at 
work. Oregonians are extremely 
proud of their state and have passed 
legislation directed toward cleaner 
air and reduced pollution of water- 
As to investment, profit or loss 
relating to the situation: 

"Profits of some soft drink 
bottlers are significantly below the 
1971 and 1972 levels, in some instances 
by 40 per cent, due to increased labor 
and other costs incurred to comply 
with the bottle bill," Schollmeyer 
reports. 

"The bill hs practically eliminat- 
ed the metal container from use in 
Oregon. 

"Retail stores are reducing the 



! items with wine and other 
products that have higher profit 
margins and less handling problems. 
Less shelf space could result in 
reduced demand for beer and soft 
drinks." 

The law classifies containers into 
two categories: (1) certified contain- 
ers, those which are reusable by more 
than one manufacturer, and (2) 



noncertified containers, which are all 
others. 

The certified container has 3- 
deposit-refund value of not less than- 
two cents. Such a container would be' 
a standard 12-ounce returnable beeri 
bottle or 11-ounce "stubbie." 

The noncertified &lt; 
private mold bottles that &lt;

directly. The non-certified container^

considered similar legislation lately, 
with none to date enacting it.

history and social politics. The blacks 
in this country used not to be violent. 
They learned violence from their 
white oppressors over hundreds of 
years of economical, physical and 
psychological slavery. The black 
uprisings in the ghettos, the mounting 



crime and hatred is in direct relation 
to criminal indifference of our white 
society and its government to change 
its economic, social and psychological 
attitudes, and give the minorities 
equal opportunities for decent living. 
The reality of American racism puts 
us next to racial attitudes of South 
Africa. It is true, that our laws are 
different, but they are as far removed 
from practice, as Russian labor 
camps are from their glossy constitu- 

In our country dedicated to "life, 
liberty and pursuit of happiness," all 
that the majority of blacks have got is 
a life of injustice, freedom to be poor 
and continually humiliated by the 
"superior race," and the happiness of 
working as unskilled labor and 
cleaning women. 

The inner cities are rotting and 
becoming pools of human waste and 
expendable men in the midst of white 



path of white hatred. 

It is quite possible that we have 
missed the right turn, did not extend 
on time our hand to black neighbor. 
when reconciliation was still possible. 
Perhaps it is too late to patch up this 
country, since too many lives 
vanished uselessly in the melting pot 
of burning gasoline, lynchings, kill- 
ings and racial prejudice. 

However, unless*we reconsider 
our priorities and put our money arid 
souls into betterment of this society, 
and not into improvement of our 
refrigerators, the lethal atmosphere

ST. JOHN'S JOURNAL 



Von Mises warned of war 



Student assails senate for lack off action 



To the Editor: 

I have been a student on this 
campus for several years and have 



tradition of Mike Nussbaumer, Mark 
Sauder. Mark Pranke and others, he 
isZtruly a devoted servant to the 
students' interests. 

• Now, one may not always agree 
with Mr. Abie's policies, attitudes and 
programs, but no one can contest his 
dedication, perserverance, and loyal- 
ty. I understand that it is not unusual 
for him to spend eight hours a day 
working in student government on 
everything from intra-murals to the 
new super-chancellor. 

; Because of his dedication he and 
our campus have become highly 
respected leaders of state-wide 
student rights. He opted for the 
concept of super-chancellor long 
Before it became popular and is 
working hard to implement it. He has 
mure than once lobbied in Indiana- 
polis for more funds and representa- 
tion for our campus. When one 
considers what he has done and takes 
into consideration that Mr. Able is a 
quadrapalegic in a wheel chair-well, 
the mind boggles. 

While Mr. Able likes to refer to 
himself as disabled and not handicap- 
ped, I would contend that, indeed, we 
■do have a handicap in Student 
^Government - the present Student 
Senate. 

Whatever Mr. Able has accom- 
plished on and for this campus, it has 
practically been negated by the 
Senate. Don't get me wrong, they 
haven't opposed them on hardly 
anything. In fact, that's what they've 
done; hardly anything. Ask yourself 
the following questions: 
-Where is the student directory that 
has traditionally been out by Octo- 



flounder financially whiie funds ; 

available to save it? 

-Why has the tutoring program been 

abandoned? 

-Why must students pay to use 

facilities in the Union Building (i.e. 



-Is it necessary to pay i 
parking fees for inadequate facilities? 

Apparently the Senate has more 
important things to do such as getting 
hot food machines for the cafeteria or 
outlining "their" office space in the 
Union Building (talk about ego trips) 

We would have been better off not 
electing a Senate at all. At least we 
would have had an excuse for getting 
nothing done. 

1 don't mean to attack the Senate 
as individuals but it seems to me that 
if they are going to serve in office they 
might at least make a sincere effort to 
fullfill their responsibilities. 

I found it interesting to talk to the 
secretaries and non-Senate members 
of Student Government. According to 
them it is very rare to see a Senator's 
face in the Student Government 
office, much less to see them doing 
anything constructive for the stu- 
dents. I also understand they even 
have trouble getting a simple quorum 
(8 of 14) for a meeting. 

If these people cannot or will not 
get off their asses and do something 
valuable I would suggest they do the 
students a real service and resign. 

In closing this letter I would like 
to take partial blame for the present 
situation I believed the ABC party 
platform last spring and voted for the 
entire ticket. With the exception of 
Mr. Able the entire party has been a 
dismal failure.

Impressions' makes 
one— this time 

To the Editor: 

The "eye-disgusting manner" in 
which Impressions Magazine is 
published is due to the fact that our 
student senate considers dances, golf 
teams, and rock concerts of a higher 
priority than literature and Impressi- 
ons Magazine is obliged to print 4,000 
issues this year on $600. We cannot 
afford a typewriter, hence the "ugly 
1945 standard typewriter," and col- 
ored and textured pages, if indeed 
such have any place in a literary 
effort, are also out of the question. 
Photographs are being used to as high 
' incidental budget will 



however, the real importance of 
prettiness in this case, the magazine 
being primarily a literary effort. 

I trust that the students will 
understand why Impressions is not 
pretty ; as regards content, I similarly 
believe they will have the good sense 
to ignore the ravings of Ms. Franke, 
who by the way never did give a 
concrete definition of just what 
"enlightened prose or poetry" is and 
probably does not know, and to at 
least remain open to the possibility 



and one professor of literature knows 



I encourage &lt; 
cism and invite anyone who

Austrian born tree market e 
Ludwig von Mises. "The main thing is 
In discard the ideology that generates 

Von Mises conclusively demon- 
strated that the ideology of war was 
the belief in the all-powerful state. 
Significantly, hi-, words quoted above 
from his magnum opus on economics, 
"Human Action," were written in 1948 
just as the first Arab-Israeli war was 
coming to its inconclusive end. The 
fighting in Palestine for the establish- 
ment of a "Jewish homeland" was 
being carred on by many who had 
escaped the horrors of Hitler's 
Nazism. 

However, unlike those refugees, 
Ludwig von Mises understood more 
clearly andprotoundly what were the 
real roots of war. He, too, had fled his 
native Austria at the onset of Nazism 
in 1934, but he had forecast that 
conflict and those that have since 
engulfed the nations of the globe in 
this century. 

Por example, in his 1944 work, 
"Omnipotent Government, The Rise 
of the Total State and Total War," he 
wrote as the globe was engulfed in 
World War II : "All the oratory of the 
advocates of government omnipo- 



tence cannot annul the fact that there 
is but one system that makes for 
durable peace: a free market 
economy. Government control leads 
lo economic nationalism and thus 
results in cnflict."

Any rational examination of the 
warring aggressors in every conflict 
since World War I to the present 
illustrates and confirms this observa- 

The current and fourth Arab- 
Israeli war is a case in point. While 
most look upon the conflict as a clash 
between religions, in reality it is a

varying forms of state socialism. And 
Israel began as a Socialist state with 
ideas imported from Europe via the 
Zionists. 

The difference between the econ- 
omic systems is only in degrees, not in 
principle. For while Israel permits 
the existence of a "mixed economy" 
(part free, part government control- 
led), it was nevertheless the mixed 
economy of European nations Drior (o 
each war that provided the tinder to 
ignite conflict. 

"Government control of busi- 
ness," von Mises warned, "engenders 
conflicts for which no peaceful 



"It was easy to prevent unarmed

to prevent armies from trying it. The 
sociologist and other statists were 
able to disregard or silence the 
warning voices of the economists. 
They could not disregard or silence 
the roar of cannon and detonation of 
bombs." 

It is, therefore, ironic that the 
man who formulated the became the 
father of modern economic freedom™

Male chauvinism rules the waves

In 1973, mate chauvinism rules the 
waves no less than it did in the days of 
the Vikings, 

One of my certificates that will 
never get hung is from the U. S. 
Power Squadrons, a private organiza- 
tion devoted to boating education and 
rcreation. It reads "Woman's Certifi- 
cate of Qualification" and certifies 
that I have passed prescribed courses 
in Piloting and Seamanship. 

It doesn't say that I took the same 
courses and examinations that men 
did. It does say, "The granting of a

whatsoever." 

The membership policies of this 

boating organ i 7 a I ion are being chal- 
lenged in the courts by the New 
Jersey Civil Liberties Union in Fisher 
vs. the U. S. Power Squadrons, but I 
expect that even a favorable decision 
will still leave women at sea. 

Recently, I spent a week on a 
windjammer, this being a re-created 
19th Century sailing ship that plies the 
waters off the New England coastline. 
As I described the cruise later to 
friends, "If anybody were dreaming 
up a purgatory for a liberated woman, 
this would have to be it." 

It was clear sailing until two days 
out, when the captain who knew I was 
writing a story on windjamming, 
asked if he could read some of my 
columns. He must have thought I 
wrote a "Hints from Audrey" type 
column, for shortly thereafter he 
bellowing out of his cabin and 



said: "What's the meaning of this? 
Women's Libbers are a bunch of 
frustrated old hags." 

I have become, if not immune, at 
least thick-skinned to such attacks, 
but two other "frustrated old habs," 
about 30, were not. They weren't even 
activists, merely sympathizers with 
the women's rights movement, yet 
they were subjected to such dialectic 
from the captain as "female chauvi- 
nist sows" and "the Bible says 
women's place is in the home." 

Declining to discuss the subject 
was no solution. The captain never 
missed a chance to suggest that a 
liberated woman was sexually avail- 
able to whomever wanted her. 

Complaints about women led to 
complaints about blacks. "You just 
can't talk to them the way you used 
to," the first mate commiserated with 
the teen-age son of a New York 
doctor.

Doctor's Bag 

By ARNOLD WERNER, M. D. 

QUESTION: Please write a 150 word thesis on the subject 
of vaginal flatulence. Consider specifically the following 
aspects and possible causes of the phencminon: Vaginal 
geometry, vaginal musculature, hydrodynamic phenomena 
and temporal proximity to foreign body penetration. Also 
note if this problem is common among the human species, 
or if my wife and I have made a unique medical discovery. 

ANSWER: 1 almost decided not to answer this question for 
fear of besmirching my reputation by creating the illusion 
that I write term papers for a fee. The noisy escape of air 
from the vagina is quite common. Relevant factors 
producing vaginal flatulence include vigorous and active 
intercourse in positions which allow the introduction of air 
into the vagina. Contraction of the vaginal musculature 
following the introduction of air results in a noisy expulsion, 
as ddes withdrawal of the penis. Also, the ballooning of the 
distal vagina daring sexual excitement facilitates the 
trapping of air. Intercourse in the man above position with 
the woman's knees drawn up to her chest, or 
wheelbarrowing it over the edge of the bed facilitates air 
entrapment. 

I regret to inform you that you have discovered nothing 
unique. If it has to do with sex, you can be sure it has 
happened before, many times. Sex is not an area in which 
there is much uniqueness, except hopefully, the existence of 
a personal relationship if two people are involved. That's 



QUESTION: Is it possible for the smell of a certain food 
eaten before urination or sexual intercourse to reveal itself 
while urinating or ejaculating? 

The food I am speaking of is tuna fish. Every time I eat 
a tuna fish sandwich, the smell of tuna fish for a brief 
moment exists while I urinate. Or if I have eaten tuna fish 
before 1 have intercourse, the odor of the tuna fish comes 
out during ejaculation. 

ANSWER: Certain foods definitely do affect the odor of 
urine. This is because of some breakdown products of the 
digestive process being excreted in the urine. One such 
example many people have observed is the characteristic 
smell of urine after eating asparagus. I have no data on the 
effects of food stuffs on ejaculation. While the temptation 
was great to write off the situation you describe as being 
due to belching (tuna fish does linger on the breath for sure) 
I was saved from such cynicism by a chemist who supplied 
me with the following observations: "I, for one, clearly 
have a distinctive odor within two hours of eating a whole 
can (about six oz.) of tuna. Similar, but less distinctive 
odors occur in my urine after eating about twice that much 

"Fortunately, I have done a bit of paper chromato- 
graphy of my urine, including just after meals of tuna. The 
histidine content goes up markedly at these times and I 
would not be surprised if this amino acid was the major 
factor in the odor. In the case of the respondent to the 
column, he probably is a relatively high excretor (in 
comparison with me, and, I suspect, with others), but he 
probably is well within a normal range." 

At least part of the puzzle is solved. Will someone step 
forward with information of comparable scientific quality 
about semen? I will wait and see and keep you posted. 

QUESTION: What are the symptoms of pregnancy when 
' "you are on the pill? Can a woman still have her period 
during pregnancy whether on or off the pill? 

ANSWER : When taken each and every day as directed, the 
pill is incredibly reliable and pregnancy is just about 
unheard of. However, if a woman misses more than two or 
three pills during a month, the risk of pregnancy begins to 
increase. Indeed, it might be hard to tell for a while if a 
woman on the pill is actually pregnant. However, if there is 
;i historv or taking the pill irregularly, she sure ought to be 
alarmed if the bleeding that occurs with the monthly 
cessation of the pill does not appear. Some women have 
very scant bleeding when on the pill, but if they have been 
using it regularly as directed, have no cause for concern. 
A normal menstrual period does not occur during 
pregnancy although there can be very slight bleeding at the 
time of the expected menstrual period for the first month or 
two. Most women have no trouble differentiating ihis from a 
normal period.

watch and the most exciting and satisfying sport to play. It is a sport of 
perpetual motion, which explains the major drawback of nationally 
televised NHL tilts: the camera can only be on one central area of action 
at a time. And if a spectator cant see the whole rink of action at one time, 
he is bound to come away disappointed- 
Watching hockey on TV, the average fan also mises the sound of 
continuous body contact, the sound of the puck flaming toward (he goalie, 
and the sounds of the pro hockey players Ihemselves, The latter sounds 
are not crucially missed on TV; not many of us know very many French 
cuss words. 

The major league of hockey for years has been the National Hockey 
League. But last year a rival league, the World Hockey Association, was 
established Franchises within it lured many top stars away from the 
established league by offering them astronomical salaries and long-term 
contracts. 

The NHL teams did not panic upon losing some of their best 
performers. They brought in new talent, mostly from Canadian junior 
leagues. The resulting standard of NHL play was not noticeably 
decreased, and the league's hockey palaces continued to pack in 
thousands of eager fans night in and night out. 

But for the fledgling WHA, the situation has been a bit different 
Attendance throughout the league circuit has been pitiful. To illustrate, 
last week the WHA clubs played before an average crowd of about 6,000. 
NHL entries drew an average of 14,000. 

The lowest NHL attendance was 10.600: the WHA's highest turnout 
was 7.800. And the WHA calls itself an equal to the NHL? 

The Houston Aeros of the WHA played two home tilts last week and 
drew an average of 5,200 fans. That average is not much higher than that 
of the Fort Wayne Komets of the semi-pro International Hockey League! 
Will Houston's present status ever allow them to pay the million-dollar 
contract of Gordie Howe and Sons? 

Yes.. .in about 45 years. 

Howe is a great individual, though, both on and off the ice. Just 
recently he witnessed a purse-snatching incident in downlow Houston. 
The thief sped off in a car and Howe followed him, eventually iorcing him 
onto a curb. 

The thief threw the purse out the window and sped off. Howe 
retrieved the purse and returned it to the victim. 

The hockey super-star had one request of the purse's owner and her 
boyfriend in return for his good deed of the day: "How about attending 
some of our games?" 

"I won't miss another," vowed the boyfriend. 

But it's going to lake a lot more boyfriends to keep Gordie Howe and 
Sons and the Houston Aeros in business. 

MONEY FOR THE LADIES 

The top women's professional tennis league ended another season of 
play recently with Margaret Courl leading the way in money earnings. 
She pocketed $130,000 winning 18 of the 22 tournaments she entered. 

Female pig Rosie Casals was next, garnering $90,000 for the year. 
Billie Jean King won 3 of 12 tournaments entered, and finished the 1973 
season fourth in cash earnings, collecting $51,000. Of course, Ms. King 
also picked up some grocery money after settling her affair with Bobby 
Riggs. 

The big challenger for the top spot next year will be 18-year-old 
sensation Chris Evert. She entered two tourneys in 1972, won them both, 
and collected $32,000. 

THINK ABOUT IT 

This week the spotlight goes to Barry Switzer, head pigskin coach of 
the Oklahoma Sooners. First of all. he offers his comments on succeeding 
Chuck Fairbanks, now a pro football coach at New England: "Football is 
a game of timing. Fairbanks' timing was bad. He left a year too late. I 
wish he'd left a year earlier, when we had those All-Americans and 
All-Big Eight players coming back." 

And recently. Switzer was asked why a certain player was no longer 
going to Oklahoma: "It was like a heart transplant. We tried to implant 
college on him, but his head rejected it."

make minor adjustments to become

Defense key in 
pigskin tourney 



The double-elimination tourna- 
ment in intramural football began 
last Sunday, November 11, 1973, with 
five games played. Defense was the 
name of the game in four out of the 
five contests, ending with one team 
being shut oul offensively in two 
games 



In the opening game Smith 
defeated the Super Jocks 13-0 while 
Circle K edged the Frosh 2-0. In the 
other first-round game, Stoneface 

outscored the 73 Call's 20-6. Second- 
round action saw the Super Jocks shut 



The Smith defense proved effec- 
tive as it shut off the Super Jocks in 
the 13-0 victory The Smith offensive 
attack was piloted by Joe Clinken-

On the 24th of November the 
Indiana Hoosiers and Purdue Boiler- 
makers will clash at Bloomington in 
the anjual "Old Oaken Bucket' ' 
feature. The game is sold out but will 
be televised on the Indiana-Purdue 
campus at five locations. 

The telecast will be beamed live 
from Bloomington and will be in 
color Rooms tentatively scheduled to 
be used on this campus are Rooms 
G-46 and G-50,_ Kettler Hall, and 
Rooms 266. 366, and B-74, Neff Hall.

realized, a large turnout will have to 
be present to view the Indiana- Purdue

Interest on our campus is bound 
to be high, but many students are 
obviously without tickets or transpor- 
tation to Bloomington, or just can't go 
for some other reason. Those people 
should make every effort to take 
advantage of this great opportunity ti

beard, whose two touchdown aerials 
proved to be the decisive tallies. Shib 
Neddeff and Mark Pantello hauled in 
the scoring passes. 

The other opening game saw 
Circle K edge the Frosh 2-0 in a tough 
jiefensive struggle. Earlier in the 
year, Circle K beat the Frosh by the 
same score. The safety came midway 
through the second half and provided 
the margin of victory. 

Stoneface remained undefeated 
with a 20-6 win over the 73 Call's. Phil 
and Steve Ottenweiler each tallied a 
six-pointer for the winners while John 
Cook hauled in a James White bomb 
for the lone Calt score. 

In the second round of action the 
Super Jocks swept past the Frosh 
21-0. Doug Bedwell scored twice— in- 
cluding once on a punt return. Chuck 
Wolfe also returned a punt for the 
final Super Jock tally. The victory 
kept Brock Abie's troops alive in the 
tourney while the Frosh dropped their 
second contest. 

In the final game of the day, 
Smith ran past Circle K 27-0. Joe 
Clinkenbeard opened the scoring 
barrage with a bootleg around right 
end. The next time Smith gained 
possession of the ball, Shib Neddeff 
caught a touchdown pass from 
Clinkenbeard- Mike Smith intercep- 
ted a deflected Circle K pass and 
sprinted 30 yards along the left 
sideline to make it 20-0. Mike Usina's 
pass to Mark Pantello capped the 
scoring. 

Next Sunday, November 18, 1973, 
the 73 Call's (o-ll will battle Circle K 
(1-1) and Smith (2-0) will oppose 
Stoneface (1-0) in the 1:00 contests. 
The 2:30 game will feature the Super 
Jocks ( 1-1) against the winner of the 
Calt-Circle K game. 



City college 
football meet 
being planned 

Athletic Director Jim Bolinger is 
attempting to set up a city college flag 
football tournament sponsored by 
Indiana-Purdue. Hopefully, the tour- 
ney will be a four-way affair involving 
Indiana Tech, Bible College, Concord- 
ia Senior College, and Indiana- 
Purdue. St. Francis does not have an 
organized football squad this year. 

It has not yet been decided which 
intramural football players from 
Indiana-Purdue will be asked to 
represent the schooll. It could be one 
of the top campus pigskin squads or 
an all-star group selected from all of 
this year's teams.

BOWL GAMES OUTLOOK 

Although football Bowl invitations have not yet been sent out, it is 
interesting to match speculatively some of the top college teams in the 
country in the "games of the year." 

The Rose Bowl is the only set game, with the winner of the Pacific 
Eight conference battling the Big Ten champ. The only undecided part of 
this Bowl game is the fact that four teams in the top 10 are still in the 
running. 

Ohio State (8-0) and currently ranked number one in both major 
college polls, must defeat Michigan (8-0) to gain the trip to Pasadena. But 
Michigan won't be a pushover as the Wolverines are rated fourth in the 
nation. In the Pacific Eight division last year's defending champs. 
Southern California (7-1-1), will have a crucial meeting with UCLA (8-1) 
later in the year to decide the west coast representative. Believe it or not, 
the Bruins are rated higher in the UPI poll than the Trojans. 

In the Cotton Bowl, an interesting matchup would be Texas Tech (8-1 ) 
against Texas (6-2) in the battle for the Longhorn State. The two teams 
are rated 12th and 13th respectively. But if Oklahoma ends up in this 
Bowl, the challengers should be the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame. This 
would pit the tough Irish defense against the powerful Sooner offensive 
ground game. Remember, Oklahoma still has a big matchup with 
Nebraska on November 23. 

The Sugar Bowl will have Alabama (currently second in both polls) 
against the world. Alabama will have its toughest battle of the year on 
Thanksgiving Day against the LSU Tigers (8-0) ranked seventh in the 
nation. After Alabama rips through the Tigers, the possible match-up 
will be either Notre Dame (always a good catch) or Joe Paterno's Nitteny 
Lions of Penn State. Penn State, a perennial top ten contender, is riding 
on an 8-0 record and a sixth-place rating. 

The Orange Bowl will probably feature either LSU or Nebraska, or 
maybe both, depending on the outcome of important games coming up. 

Another team which cant be countd out of the running is the Missouri 
Tigers, currently 7-2. The two losses that the Tigers have absorbed were 
to top contenders in collegiate football. 

These are some of the top teams who will compete in this year's Bowl 
games. These games should prove exciting, since most of the good teams 
are almost equally matched. 

INDIANA-PURDUE FOOTBALL 

Even though the Indiana Hoosiers and Purdue Boilermakers are 
having rough seasons, the game of the year for both squads will be the 
"Old Oaken Bucket" battle held Saturday, November 24, 1973. 

The game will be broadcast over closed-circuit television on the 
Indiana-Purdue campus. This service will be free to activity card holders 
and the public is invited to attend for one dollar. Rooms for the game will 
be announced at a later date. 

PREDICTIONS 

This week I got back on the winning track with an 84 percent mark on 
last week's NFL games. So, with confidence, the winners for next week's
