Dear Tina: 

Being a freshman at I.U.- 
Purdue, I have willingly alien- 
ated myself from student. af- 

cause up 'till now, I have had 
no reason to become involved. 
My gripe is rather trivial, but 
very aggravating. I have been 
told, just as other students 
wishing to use the stereo in 
the lounge, that because of 
tight money conditions, a 
needle can not be replaced by 
Student Services. They ac- 
tually had the gall to tell me 
they could not afford a 84 
needle, despite our myster- 
iously spent activities fees. 
Why? 

Tim Miller 

Dear Tim Miller (who just 
happens to be my brother): 

Your latter (plus many 
other comments on the same 
subject) caused me to go to 
Student Services and seek out 
someone who could explain 
this unique situation. Unfor- 
tunately (or, perhaps, other- 
wise), the person I was seek- 
ing (after four visits) did not 
keep his appointment with me, 
So, I am forced (?) to expand 
upon this subject from just a 
student's point of view. 

As I understand it, the of- 
fice of Student Services re- 
fuses to replace needles sto- 
len from tho stereo (and I also 
understand that students ore 
not the only persons guilty of 
such a henious crime, either). 
Anywoy, our Student Services' 
office, because of the tight 
money situation, cannot of- 
ford to shell our $4 or so for a 
few needles. How sod! And 
how revolting—because the 
athletic department at good 
ole" IU-PU can seem to scrape 
up the money (from our $15 
octivity fees) to poy for prime 
rib lunches and lobster tail 
suopers for our varsity teams 
PLUS $600 for new cheer- 
leader outfits (plus, plus, 
plus their drycleaning money 
which is never accounted for). 
Just ask any well-fed varsity 
player or ony well-dressed 

All letters of sugges- 
tions (etc.). should be directed 
to the Director of Athletics- 
located in Student Services... 
who will probably not be there 
anyway. -p. 

Dear Tina:

Dear Interested etc.: 

Rejoice-for os soon as 
the weather clears up, our 
lots and drive will be taken 
care of. In a recent conver. 
sation with Mr. R. F. Schaof, 
who is in charge of things 
like that, I learned many 

among which was the fact 
'hot as long as it freezes out- 
side, nothing can be done to 
the lots. Mr. Schaaf was very 
explainotory about the roads 
on our campus (the paved ones 
are taken core of only by the 
State Highway Department 
and said thot as soon as 
weather permits, something 
good will be done. 

Did you ever try to 
push around frozen gravel?

playing dangerously

wrong time with

Hats off to Schaff 



Not many of the thou- 

sponsibilities he has in main- 
taining our campus. 

Dick has been director 
for 7yoors ond enjoys his job. 
It is a demanding job, though, 
with so many responsibilities. 
He must see to things such 
as getting the 55 acres of 
grass cut to help coordinate 
building plans. He has 4 
major areas of responsibility. 
These are buildings, grounds, 
power house, and custodial 
maintenance. He has 40 
people working under him to 
keep the school functioning- 
Dick is also responsible 
for the very air we brjsalhe 
Behind two locked doors in 
his domain are two giant fil- 
ters, which remove dirt from 
the air. The first, a roll- 
type, must be changed once 



each year, The second, o bog 
type, needs a change obout 
every three yeors. Since a 
complete set of filters for 
the building cost $5,000, 
Schaof is justifiably anxious 
that all goes well between 

If you hove trouble 
keeping your house ond outo 
keys straight, picture Schaaf 
os keeper of all keys for the 
campus. To date, he has 
cataloged keys for 500 doors 
m this building plus 200 
keys far mailboxes. (Purdue 
University is responsible not 
only for building and grounds 
maintenance but for building 
security). In connection with 
the handling of keys, Dick's 
deportment must see that oil 
locks are in order, change 
lacks when necessarvi ana&lt; 
distribute the keys when 



written requests ore submit- 
ted for the use of particulor 

Even sewage gets 

Dick's close attention. Just 
os there oretwo of each piece 
of vitol equipment in the plant, 
there ore two pumps avail- 
able to lift sewage up from 
those spots below ground 
level in order to be carried 
owoy. If one pump shoulo go 
out or need repair, the other 
pump moy be pressed into 

Pipes, valves, tanks, 
cranks, sockets, and sprock- 
ets . . . none can be over- 
looked by the maintenance 
department. Imagine the di- 
lemma if Schaaf's crew 
neglected to check thermostot 
controls, light fixtures, bath- 
room (facilities, and tho hun- 
dreds of other items neces- 
sary to comfort and safety. 
The supervisors base- 
ment office is dominated by 
o huge board of floshing red 
lights, signaling that the air- 
conditioning is functioning 
in specified locations about 
the building. The chiller, 
which manages to bring relief 
to classrooms and "labs, has 
a capacity of 760 tons, enough 
to air -condition 350 private 

Dick also has. a big 
' responsibility known as the 

boiler house, which operates 
on a 24-hour basis seven days 
o week to generate steam. 
(Dick was quick to emphasize 
that plant generates no 
power, only steom). The 
boiler+iouse is separate from 
the main building in line with 
current insurance and tech- 
nical practices, which place 
power plants/ away from main 
buildings for safety and 
and economy. With this set- 
up, when new buildings ore 
constructed on the compus, 
power lines may be. extended 
directly from the separate 
boiler houses to the additions 
without the added expense 
of complete new boiler plants- 
Snow removal, too, is on 
the maintenance agendo, but 
Schaaf's greatest problem here 
lies in the fact thot his 
department must do the removal 
work mostly after dark or when 
the fewest outos are parked 
or the 2,200 parking spaces. 




DON'T LAUGH 
STANDING ON 



signal enough for 

crows to dig in with ready-to- 
go equipment that is housed 
near the boiler site. IF it isn't 
snow, it s trash being removed 
from the lawn ond drive- 
ways. Crews are out daily fai- 
th is chore. 

This man's enthusiasm 
for his work makes up far 
any minor irritations he might 
encounter. It is the same enthu- 
siasm which he says he's ex- 
perienced since he entered 
the trade almost 20 years ago 
Six years ago, he storted work-

met -as scheduled Wednesday evening in 
the student government office. 

Frank Akey reported that the - pro- 
posed bill of rights is scheduled to 
go before the faculty advisory com- 
mittees of both universities. The 
bill will be presented to the commi- 
ttees on Friday, March 19, and 
Tuesday, March 24. 

Rex Knepp announced that the next 
undertaking of the Organizational 
Comml ttee will be the re writing of the 
I. U. -Purdue student handbook. 

After adjournment, Scott Gillie 
discussed plans for the revision of 
activity fees. Fol lowing abandonment 
of the six-dollar proposal, he is pur- 
suing a plan for a scaled fee based on 
hours of enrollment. This plan would 
entitle students to a scaled amount 
of activities based on amounts of 
pa i d. fees . 

A, committee composed of the dean 
of student services, the chai rmen of 
the Indiana and Purdue student af- 
fairs committees, the student body 
president and vice-president, and one 
"member elected from the student as-
