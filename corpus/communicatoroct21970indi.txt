Student Union Board : 

Responsibility to Students ? 

During a recent random sample of the student body, 
some 75% who responded knew that Scott Cillre was student 
body president while only 29% knew that Hike Herron was 
Chairman of the Student Union Board. When informed of these 
results, Mr. Herron laughed, shrugged his shoulders and said 
something to the effect of "What did you expect, anyways?" 
And then he walked off. 

Before proceeding, I would like to make two things 
clear: I) this is not a personal attack against Mr. Herron; 
2] any comments that I make in this letter are in the capacity 
of one individual concerned student. 

During the past three years, the student government has 
attempted to be responsive to student needs while at the 
same time the SUB has become increasingly isolated from 
students' opinion. The SUB isolation has been apparent by 
their responsibility to the students. An attitude that from 
my observations over the years would seem to suggest that 
the SUB docs not feel responsible to the students for its 
actions. An attitude that was summed up by one SUB member 
at the end of the last semester when he said, "We didn't get 
alot done this year, but we had fun." Considering that the 
SUB had 115,000 of student activity fee money last year, 
one would wonder if this cavalier attitude was justified. 

This year, the SUB is asking for 512,000 of the student 
activity fees. This is (he SUB trade record this year: 
I) Campus organizations got less than one month's notice 
that Penny Carnival would be held October 24; 2) Campus 
organiiations got jpe (1) day notice before club call out. 
And when one remembers that the last two Harbararbor Days, 
the so called big social event of the year, have come very 
close to being complete flops, one must seriously question 
the present method of organizing the SUB. 

I believe that the real problem is the method of select- 
ing members of the SUB. Only a minority of the SUB is 
elected by the student body. Host vacancies are filled by 
the present members electing a candidate. In other words, 
the SUB is composed of members who do not feel any need 
to be responsible to the student body. I feel that the only 
solution is the direct election of all SUB members in a gen- 
eral election, tt is only through an election campaign that the 
policies of the SUB and what it should be doing can be 
discussed before the student body. Hopefully, the studenU 
will make intelligent decisions on who will be on the SUB. 
But the students should elect the people who will decide on 
what will happen to SI5.000 of their activity fee.

The Classical Cop-outa 
of any group in power are 
that the people either don't

or that the people are la full

Neither one of these wo 
fallacies or rationalizalionB 
are prevalent in the current 

The main objectives of

Looking For Friends 



by 



Scott Cillie 



With the events of last spring at Kent Slate and Jackson 
State and at universities throughout the nation, one result of 
those events is abundantly clear. The feeling of antiriatel' 
lectualism and anti-academia has not been seen with such 
vigor since the height of the McCarthy (joe) era. 

As members of the university community, we should be 
well aware that unless we find political candidates friendly 
to higher education, our membership in the community of 
students, faculty, and staff is in doubt. Why? As a member 
university of the Purdue and Indiana systems. I.U^P.U. at' 
Fort Hoyne is in danger of going down with the entire sys- 

A tuition increase of the magnitude of the one implemen- 
ted Fall Semester, 1969, will look small in comparison to 
the one we will face if our state polilicos determine to make 
political hay out of the universities. 

We must make the distinction between Berkeley and 
I.U.-P.U. 

Certainly, we as students make that distinction; how- 
ever, many of those people seeking office in the November 
Election see our university and all universities as being 
collectively the source of all evil. 

The Campus Political Forum has invited all local can- 
didates to come out to our campus. Many of those '^"ndida- 
ates will not set foot in a university. Perhaps, thai in itself 
is indicative of their gualificotions. 

Attend the sessions of the C.P.F. and find out who our 
llyare. We need them desperately.

CONSUMER FACTS 



h- Darrell Pamin 

Ralph Kader, after bringing down the corporate walls ot 
General Motors, has seized HEW and the Food and Drug 
Administration. Time Magazine reports it as what " . . . ■ 
may well be the most devastating critique ot a U.S. Govern' 
meat Agency ever issued . . . -' 

"Making food appear what it is not is an integral part 
ot the 8125.000,000,000.00 food industry. The deception 
ranges from the surface packaging to the inte^lty of the food 
products quality to the vary shaping of food tastes. The 
industry's catering is calculated to sharpen and meet, super- 
ficially, consumer tastes at the cost of other critical con- 
sumer needs. These tastes include palatability, tenderness, 
visual presentability, and convenience. They are met by a 
versatile misuse of modern chemistry, packaging, and mer- 
chandise techniques. But meeting these testes does not lead 
unfortunately, to fulfilling the requisites of purity, whole- 
someness, safety, and nutrition." These arc Nader's intro- 
ductory words to the book, "The Chemical Feast" by James 

One initial example, is cited in this report by Nader's 
Readers, coloring additives, preservatives, seasonings and 
tenderizers camojflage the rapid increase of fat content in 
frankfurters (33 per cent 1969 of weight on the average), 
their decrease in meat protein, and the substandard quality 
of the meat. Another, perhaps familiar to housewives, the 
nutritional deception about"white enriched flour" that covers 
up the permanent stripping in the process of most nutrients. 
Add another the general public is familiar with cyclamates, 

Cyclamates; Turner charges the FDA delected cyclamale; 
danger initially in 1950. This is when Abbott Laboratories 
filed a new drug application for Sucaryl Sodium. Abbott's 
stated medical purpose for the drug was "... for use in 
foods and beverages by diabetics and by others who must 

Turner notes in 1950 the FDA had clearly noted the 
appearance of malignant tumors on their laboratory sheets 
used for finding-approval of the drug.- It fcve'aled "a' highly 
suspicous frequency of lung tumors . . ." In addition of less 
than 100 rats tested by the FDA then, six had rare ovarian.

about once in ten thousand times . "This makes it more than 
600 times the nurmal occurence," Turner points out. 

Warnings came again and again for the next 19 years. 
Evidence built up. in 1954 the Food Nutrition Board warned, 
"... cyclamates have physiologic activity in addition to 
the sweetening effect." While the FDA slept, the food indus- 
try began use of cyclamates in varying quantities in 15% ot 
all consumed food in the U.S. 

On October 18.196V, Secretar)' Finch finally ended the 
profits of cyclamates, but his manner of removal was. Turner 



charges, by"cowardly, bureaucratic backstcpping," Finch 
failed to tell the public that the law requires a food additive 
to be established as safe before it is used. The Secretary 
backed into an apologetic enforcement of one particular 
cod icii ot the law, saying"! have acted under the provisions 
of the lawbecausc ... I am required to." (cyclnmote Press 
Conference, October 18,1969) The Cyclamates case estab- 
lishes the tact that the FDA has been less than diligent in 
applying the food protection laws. 

Hidden Ingredianls: On January 21,1966, against nearly 
unanimous objection ot FDA staff personel. Turner charges 
FDA Commissoner James Goddard,by himself, issued a food 
standard regulation for nonalcoholic beverages. It ended any 
doubts about the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. God- 
dard's regulation allowed cola drink manufacturers and the 
makers of Dr. Pepper to add catleinelo their products without 
saying so on the label. All other soft drink manufacturers 
were required to do so. 

Turner states "The failure to label caffeine on cola 
drinks and Dr. Pepper does not necessarily present a health 
hazard. It does demonstrate an inaensitivity toward honesty 
and fair dealing with con6'jmers."Some consumers may wish 
to avoid caffeine, Turne- charges, on various grounds. 
"Mormons reject caffeine oa religious grounds." Some medi- 
cal doctors consider it a health risk. Turner sights one 
example, "Dr. Sammuel Bellet, Chief of Cardiology of Phil- 
adelphia General Hospital, has suggested caffeine may be 
more importont than smoking in setting the stage for heart 
attacks." 

Turner reports Coca Cola and Dr. Pepper answer these 
charges ot failure to label caffeine on two arguments; (l)they 
claim it is well known by the public that caffeine is in these 
soft drinks, and (2) they argue consumers are "perfectly 
satisfied with our practice of not labeling it." 

Last Example: Consumer interest by food manutaclurers 
is no more than dollar interest. One more interesting insight 
from a thoroughly documented study should convince renders 
to read "The Chemical Feast." 

. The Lipton Company's Beef Slrognnoffj one ot a scries 
ot easy to, serve foods made primarily from soy beans, ill- 
ustrates how a food standard can be manipulated to fool the 
consumer. Turner writes, "The Deparlmcnl of Agriculture 
'-.vhich sets standards for meat pruducls) requires ihnl Beef 
Siroganotf consist of 45?= meal, the rest, being noodles, 
garnish, and sour cream. Liplon'E^wilh government acqiiics- 
cnce, adds much less than 45S meat. Il packages the Sirogan- 
otf in 3 separate pockages: I, noodles . 2, garnish and sour 
cream, 3. the final package has beet, sour cream, and soy 
protein. Forty Five per cent ot the third package is meat. 
When prepared, Liplon's Stroganotf contains approximately 
20a meat rather than 45'^ as required by the food standnrd," 
" . . . iheFDAbas not taken action." Will you?

Upon interviewing the 
spokesivoman of the local 
movcment.I found thot the 
enthusiasts arc not of the 
hostile band lo he found in 
the large east and west 

prefer to approach the 

philosophical manner. 

The function of the 
movement as a rational 
organization is to eslab- 
lish sexual equality as far 
as legal rights, labor 
privileges . arc concerned' 
and these are the causes 
tvhich are upheld in the big 
cities in irrational and often 
ways. In f-'ort Wayne

the 



prin- 



ciples are followed, but 
with a few additions and

. On i 



local basis, the movement 
is concerned mainly with 
establishing social equality. 

Most o[ the present 
members were and still are 
social activists who were 
active in welfare projects, 
such as MACRO, which I 
believe stands for Mothers 
and Children's Hehabilit- 
ation, but don't quote me. 
The averoge age of the loc- 
al enthusiasts is approx- 
imately 30 years and the age 
range is from 16 -6B male 
and female alike. The cause 
for the median age being 30 
is probably a result of ex- 
perience, education arid free 

particular age group. The 
geographical extent of the 
Fort tfayne movement

About 100 women attended 
a recent rap session, and

this is the active numeri-

need. Women may

by Steve Pettyjohn 

Because ihey feel that 
student opinion is important, 
the brothers of Alpha Epsilon 
Kiippa fraternjt) plan to con- 
samples of student opinion 
during the course of the sem- 

The firet sample was 
concluded on Thursday, Oct. 
24 in the student lounge and 
cafeteria between 11:00 and 
11:30 A.M. This sample was 
designed to indicate if 
students knew who was 
leading the Student Govern- 
ment and Student Union Board. 
The following results ore 
based on the 108 students wht 

The first question was 
■Who is Student Body Pres- 
ident at lU-PU this year?" 
The students could choose 
from the following six names: 
MikcNusbaumer, Scott Gillie, 
Mike rierron, Mark Souder, 
and Steve Pettyjohn. Seven- 
ty-five per cent correctly 
indicated that Scott Gillie 
wos Student Body President. 
The second question 
was "What is the name of the 
political parly which controls 
this years student govern- 
ment?" The choices were: 
Action Party (AP), Pro- 



gressive Student Alliance (PS 

A), and Student Liberation 
Front (SLF). Seventy-four

The results of the

cate that the students arc 
better informed about the 
student government than the 
Student Union Board. Perhaps 
this is a result of the stu- 
dents' governments efforla 
to be known and responsive 
to the students.

ADAM'S 
APPLE 

TO 
REOPEN ? 

A 
BACKGROmSD 



Wayne was indeed fortunate 
this summer to have had al 
it's service ADAM'S AP- 
PLE. Located or the Land- 
ing and billed as a Chriat- 
iaa coffee house, the A- 
DAM'S APPLE provided 
the only officially ssncti - 
fied puhlic haven for the 
young, of the city, to come 
together on those often 
times monotonouB summer 
evenings. And come they 
did. Crowds of 200 to 500 
every night; people came to 
meet their friends. Many 
who came met the Lord! 
Yes. that's right! Many who 
came met the Lord! Not a

to an estimate by John Loyd, 
manager and coordinator of 

Adam's Apple. At the

who didn't appi

An historical outline of 
the Adam's Apple Movement 
should center on the oforc- 
\pd Loyd, who at 



27, i 



iwlec 



der among the young of our 
community. Like so many of 
his generation, he too found 
himself rejecting the estab- 
lished values and cultural 
mores of an all too hypo- 
critical uns^nsitive society. 
And like many others, he 
turned to drugs for a sol- 
ution. 

During a three year span 
which found John living in 

even participating in a my- 
stical drug cult he was con- 
vinced that drugs were lead- 
ing him to a spiritual re- 
ward. However, this life, by 
John Loyd's experience.did 
not prove to be the way. 



After 



of 



search along this path, he 
freaked out on acid one 



night and ran his car 80 
mph into a bridge in an at- 

While recovering in the 

Bible which he began read- 
ing , and as John puts it, 
"everything started coming 
;ogether". He accepted 



Chri! 



ml i 



, and once out of the 
hospital, began restructu- 
ring his life. He also felt 
called upon to share this 
new found life with others. 
"A lot of stuff happened to 
me in the next year with the 
Holy Spirit," relates Johrs 
"really started coming to me 
in a special way and I knew 
He hod something for me to 
do and 1 knew He called me 
for some kind of reason. I 
knew these experiences 
were too super just to give 
to me for my own self." 
It was during this per- 
iod while living on west 
Berry street that John met 
some students of the Fort 
Wayne Art Museum who had 
gone much the same route. 
Together they began attend- 
ing church services at the 
Calvary Temple and it was 
in association with the peo- 
ple at Calvary Temple that 
the idea for Adam's Ap- 
ple sprang. The idea being 
to provide a much needed 
place for kids to congregate 
as well as being a platform 
for John and others of a 



like 



thei 



their message of life. 

From idea to realization 
meant finding a building and 
securing the necessary equ- 
ipment. An empty building 

found to be rentable at a 
very low sum and much of 
the needed equipment was 
donated by local businesses. 
In a short lime they were set 
up and in early June the o- 
pcration began rolling. 

At the very outset Adam's 
Apple was a visable success 
with the kids, who flocked 
to the Landing to see what

music provided by

began complaining that the 
presence of all those kids 
milling about was repelling 
their customers and as a 
result business was 

suffering. In the interest 
of what they determined was 
their own survival, they 
began taking steps to oust 
the Adam's Apple from their 
well knit neighborhood. By 
making their one sided 
objections known to United 
Telephone in Kansas City, 
the owners of the building 
housing the "questionable" 
enterprise, they succeeded 
and the Adam's Apple was 
out as of September 1st. 
However. John Loyd 
and the Adam's Apple are 
by no means finished. They 
now have a tremendous 
backing among the communit;
