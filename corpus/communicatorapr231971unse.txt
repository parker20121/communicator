cont. from pg. 7 

Ruth Goeglein 

"Student givernment must fune' : on to its full capacity. I believe this 
will be achieved through the active arlicipalion of the SLF senators. I hope 
to give that dedicated action for the benefit of each student," 
Steven Has singer 

"In times like these, it is time for every student to stand up and be 
counted. In the past, student government has not been strong. So vote for 
the Power Party- Student Liberation Front," 
Stan J ones 

"Presently, the student athletic f ee U controlled by the Administra- 
tion. This is intolerable! The students must.be in a position at all times to 
determine how their money is to be spent. I pledge to work toward this goal. 
John Mann 

"SLF is supporting a platform of government for all the students, not 
just certain factions. SLF means power to all the students! 
John Perkins 

"It is the duly of student senators to represent the demands of the stu- 
dents, a function which I can perform in that I have no political reason to do 
otherwise." 
Michael A. Pfunstein 

"With the rapid growth and development of our campus, it is imperative 
to obtain the necessary student leadership to protect student rights and 
promote the interest of all students in every phase of University life. The 
Quality of the SLF ticket is such thai it can "effectively" meet the chal- 
lenges of the coming year." 

Other senatorial candidates on the SLF ticket include: Darrell Parnin, 
Dan Richer, and Bill Maccall. Speaking [or the entire SLF ticket. Party 
leader, Phil Cagle had this to say. 

"The entire slate of the SLF party has committed themselves to pro- 
moting the students' position as a Yjjrnp"'"C '"'■'-' '" relation to our admin- 
istration.We have been pushed around long enough, and Mark Souder and 
Joe Farrell have sufficient experience in student government to stand firm 
for all of us. Mark Souder is the only serious presidential candidate with a 
previous background in student government, he was the IU-PU student bodyp, 
last year. We have kad it-no longer can we, as concerned students watch 
our Administration shove parking fees down our throats, at our commutor 
college. Mark and Joe and the entire SLF ticket will work for you, the stu- 
dents, and not for themselves. The SLF campaign will really begin after our 
slute has been elected. 

Be a responsible student and vote for a responsible SLF ticket. Please: 



' vote SLF, the party that will reflect student opinion if elected." 

In closing, the SLF party would like to express what they consider the 
general objectives of the SLF party. 

We in SLF desire to stress three major points. They are: I) the rele- 
vance of student government 2) the necessity for qualified leadership and 
3) the importance of bettering communication between the student and his 
government. 

Student government is important to each student at Indiana-Purdue for a 
number of reasons. First of all, these elected leaders spend over 80,000 
dollars of student activity fee money. Therefore, each student should have 
a financial interest in the election. Secondly, student government is res- 
ponsible for representing student interests in university affairs. Everything 
from paid parking to student evaluation of faculty receives what student 
input it gets from student government. And thirdly, the elected representa- 
tives will represent our campus to the public. 

The necessity for qualified leadership is easily apparent. The responw 
sibilities and duties of student government are complex and require indivi- 
duals who understand the nature of them. Not only should these leaders be 
capable and mature enough to handle the problems that do arise, but they 
should also_ be willing and able to stand up for student interests. While we 
condemn violence, we feel that student government leaders should not be 
"yes-men" who kowtow to every whim and wish of the administration. 

The third issue of great importance is that of communication. We feel 
that student governments of the past have frequently not been responsive to 
the needs and desires of the students, because the student governments have 
not encouraged nor sought input from the average student. If and when we 
are elected, we pledge to endeavor to open the channels of communication 
between the student and his government. 

We feel the candidates of SLF are best qualified to meet these needs of

Purdue-Indiana Theatre has gone beyond the limits of traditional theatre 
n its last production of the season— Earthman. Earthman is an original, 
mprovisationally developed play with music. 

Starting with the ideas of men such as Buckminster Fuller, Martin Buber, 
I Alvin Tofflu and Marshal McLuhan, the cast, under the direction of Dr. 
ieloped an original interpretation of how man was 
j (Primitive), how he is (Modern), and where he is going (Future). 

The ideas conveyed in Earthman are unique and exciting, but moreso is 
the performance. The attitude of the actors toward their audience has broken, 
, traditional formality. Earthman is not a spectacle, but an experience. Earth- 
n is not a product of the minds of creative individuals, but a process. 
e cast stimulates the audience lo share in the discovery of Earthman, ra- 
:r than restrain them in therole of objective viewers. 
The play begins with a cast of eight, but as the performances progresses 
cast is expanded to include every person in the theatre. An audience 
■niber cannot watch Earthman without becoming involved in it. 

The audience is in close proximity to the actors and the stage. Dr.

by Harty 

In this day of crusades and social changes, there Is an area which has 
not yet been challenged. No one has taken issue with the inequities that 
exist in the restrooms of this campus. It was recently.brought.to my atten- 
tion that the Ladies Rooms have lounges, while the Mens Rooms do not. 
One wag remarked that men do have seating arrangements, but it was quickly 
pointed out that these are without cushions. Why is this allowed to continue?, 
Why has nothing been done about it? It seems to me an unfair act of discrim- 
ination which requires the attention of the Hen's Liberation Movement. 

The Men's Lib. should immediately start a campaign for equal treat- 
ment. If Ladies can have couches, Men should have couches too. Don't Men 
also need a place to relax? Shouldn't the Men be provided with a place for 
retreat when the burden of female chauvinism gets too heavy to bear? After 
all, this is a Democracy you know. There must be something that can be 
done about such such obviously discriminatory conditions. 

One thing that could be done is to have a massive non-violent movement 
in the bathrooms. This would surely create a stink and would draw attention 
to the cause. A sit-in would be a natural. Think of it: if we commanded the 
restrooms, there is no way the administration could wash its hands of the 
affair. We must, however, keep in mind that this is not just a struggle for 
padded potties; this is- a struggle to protect the rights of the individual. 

Commie pinko fascists have infiltrated the plumbing system. and have 
begun to dictate who will sit in comfort and who 'shall stand in line. It is 
part of a world-wide plot to control the very guts of our nation. ...It must be 
stopped. ...The place to stop it is here. ...The time to stop it is now,... 
Ladies, this is not a fight against the females: it is a fight against female 
chauvinism which weakens our moral fibre and makes us prey to the out- 
side forces just waiting to move in. Think about it: soon the males will be 
too tired from standing in line to want to protect this country when the time 
comes; females, who have been comforted into lethargy by their luxurious 
tee-tee tee-pees, will not be able to recognize the danger in time to over- 
come the negative effects or separate but unequal facilities, which tend to 
divide and weaken us. We must unite— NOW! 

No one could possibly mistake this as a plea for community crapp*rs 
such as exist in the Orient, but it is a plea for community strength such as 
exists in other People's Movements. Only by uniting can our bathrooms be 
kept safe. When the Men begin their sit-ins, the Ladies can help by handing 
out information leaflets printed on absorbent sheets of various attractive 
colors. (Please, don't squeeze the leaflets.) The Ladies can further help by 
boycotting the Ladies Rooms at the same time that the men occupy the Men's 
Rooms. Let the halls of IU-PU Regional resound with the loyal cry of to- 
gether people as they proclaim, "Hell no, we won't go!"

Tran Van 
Dinh, South 
Vietnamese 
Ambassador, 
speaks on 
Vietnamese 
Sfrtf Conflict 

Last Wednesday. Tran V a r» D~J n h spoke on ci 
regarding the Vietnam War, He is a former South 
Vietnamese Ambassador to the U.S. and held many 1 
offices in the South Vietnamese government. 

He began by talking about Ho Chi Minn and the 
history of the Vietnam War. In 1943 Ho was ar- 
rested in China. The U.5. was influential in 
bringing him back to Vietna.m for they unde rstoo'tod 
Ho's stand of nationalism.They were correct, 
for he became very popular in Vietnam, due to 
th i s nat i ona I i sm, 

Tran feels that the U.S.'s first mistake in 
Vietnam was in not recogn i z i ng the government 
when independence was declared in 1945. Further 
mistakes were the helping of France in 1950 
and not allowing elections in 1956. 

The religious di spute is of importance in 
Vietnam. The war is, in effect, pullinq the 
two religions. Catholic and Buddhist (the major- 
ity) together. The Catholic faith in Vietnam 
is related closely by the people to coloniza- 
tion by France. This does not mean that Ca- 
thol i cs are all ant i -commun is^nd all Buddhists 
are commun i st . 

The coming elections in Vietnam would prove 
to be an opportune time for withdrawal of Amer- 
ican troops. With a resonably free election, a 
somewhate peace candidate would win. If the Viet- 
namese were allowed a transition period of 3-5 
years, they would be able to make a political 
decision on their own. 

Tran noted that V i etnami zat i on will not suc- 
ceed. In case no one remembers, it's the same 
plan that the Franch had. Now the South Viet- 
namese army is not an army. It lacks the national 
interest which is essential to hold an army 
together. One problem after withdrawal will be 
the effect on the South Vietnamese economy. It, 
too, will need a transition period to get away 
from the dependence of a black market military

Tran cited one method of ending the war. A 
third party, such as Sweden, would check both 
factions. North Vietnam would release POW.s 
to this third Party in proportion to the num- 
ber of troops withdrawn. This would be the 
safest guarantee of no cheating and a safe wav 
to end the war . 



The Harbararbar Queen contest will be.

ALLIANCE FOR A BETTER CAMPUS PLATFORM: 

An Alliance for a Better Campus was formed for the specific purpose of 
utilising the facilities of Students' Government for the establishing of a 
university identity through the student body of Indiana and Purdue U\ 
silies at Fort Wayne. We f ec t that this must be done in all three phases of 
campus Ufe: academic, social, and athletic. In conjunction with our explicit 
purpose, we pledge, that if elected, we will: 

1. Serve continually throughout the entirely of next year; 

2. Re-orient Student Union Board's appeal from only the organisations 
to the individual students; 

3. Introduce the necessary constitutional amendments to insure the 
the popular election of Student Union Board members; 

4. Maintain and improve those free social programs that are already in 
in existence; i.e., Convocations, Purdue- Indiana Theatre, Film Series 

5. Increase the number of free social events available to students; 
6 Improve and expand the present intramural programs; 

7. Encourage student support for the campus varsity athletic teams; 

8. Attempt to procure a student recreation room off the student /ounge; 

9. Pressure the Communicator into self-improvement. 

10. Continue those present Students' Govememnt programs that are good; 
i.e., Free University, Students' Newsletter, Student Directory, Faculty Eval- 
uation; 

II. fork for the finalizolion of those Students' Government proposed pro- 
grams that are good; i.e.. Campus Parliament, and Student Bill of Rights.

THE SLF PARTY By Charles Braun 

In order for you, the students to make an intelligent choice in the 
coming student elections, you must be aware of who is running and know 
what they stand for^By presenting the following statements made by some 
of the students associated with the SLF Party, we hope it will fullfill this 
purpose. The candidates who you will elect will represent you in your stu- 
dent government. After reading what the SLF Party represents, we hope you 
will consider us when voting. 
Mark Souder-SLF Presidential Candidate 

"It is important that your student government leaders know what they 
afe doing so they can represent you well. I have been student body president 
before, have tried to be abreast with current affairs, and will do my best to 
serve your interests in the future." 
Joe Farrell-SLF Vice-Presidential Candidate 

"The SLF campaign will begin after we have been elected. Our goal is 
full participation by the students." 
SLF Senate Candidates 
Chris Beerman 



"I would really like to see a student government that keeps in touch 
with the students. Student government can't function properly if the only 
time the students hear from their "representatives" is during the cam- 
paign." 
Charles Braun 

"I strongly believe that in order for the student government to truly 
represent and work for you, the students, there must be substantive and 
effective communication between you and the representatives you elect. If 
elected, I shall be totally dedicated to this objective, and I will not be 
afraid to act in your behalf- 
Glen Emley 

"If elected, I will maintain an "open door" policy of being fully avail- 
able for communication between the students, me, and the other representa- 
tives. Communication is the key to human understanding. 
Lawrence Fortress 



"I am not in a position to make any promises; I can only say that I a

environmental 
teach-in 



how 

to 

reach 

the 
poor 

Alan Guttmacher's talk at last week,; En- 
vironmental Teach-in concerned basically the 
democratization of birth control. How does one 
spread birth control techniques to the poor? 

In earlier days, birth control was for only 
the people who could afford it. "The rich 
get richer, and the poor get children." A few 
people saw the need of extending techniques 
to the masses, where the help was needed. The 
problem is still with us, as these people were 
hampered by the social moves of the times. 

Today the fight goes on with Alan Guttmacher 
and his clinics all over the country. When his 
clinics began they helped only married people 
who were refered to the clinic by a physician, 
in 1959 they began to help unmarried persons 
over 21 years old. Three years ago, they began 
the policy of denying birth control adv-ice to 
no one, regardless of age or medical status. 

Guttmacher strongly favors total repeal of 
all abortion laws. He views abortion as a "safe 
human back-up mechanism for failed contracep- 
tion". Legal abortions by qualified physicians 
will be the only way to end unsafe abortions. 

Since the liberalizing of New York's abortion 
law 97,000 abortions have been performed in 
New York, with 40,000 in New York State, Only 8 
deaths have resulted from 100,000 abortions. 
Gutlmacher is planning clinics where abortions 
will cost only J80 or less. 

Three things are to be stressed, according to 
Guttmacher. Contraception should be available 
to all, free if necessary. Abortion should be 
available on request. Sterilization should 
also be available if it is wanted. 

Daniel Weiss, one of the th ree main speakers 
at the Environmental Teach/In, April 19, dis- 
cussed Abort ion: F acts and I ssues . 

Weiss is the head of Medref, an abortion refer 
in fJew York^ci ty . He was former I y 





an administrative assistant to Albert Einstein 
Hospital and is credited for designing the 
present abortion system there. 

Weiss began by stating "...what has happened 
&lt; lega I i zat ion of abortion in New York) hopefully 
fE going to serve in the next few years as now 
throughout the United States." 

Weiss said that since the legalization of 

York on July 1, 1970 approxi- 




s I udi crous for

any individual to have to travel to and from a 
state for a medical procedure," 



iss ended his d i scus_ 
al questions from the audience about abortion. 

A debate followed Weiss, speech on the topic, 
Resolved: That, the abortion law in Indiana shoulc 



be repea I ed for a 



i be ra I I aw. 



u= icpesaieu ior a mo re I'oerai law. 

Debating on the affirmative side was Dr. 
Forrest Whitman, a Unitarian minister from Elk- 
hart and coordinator for Indiana Clergy counsel- 
tation Service for Problem Pregnancies, and a 
Fort Wayne lawyer, Mr. William Kern. 

Dr. Juergens, M.D. and Father Fichtner, pro- 
fessor of Dogmatic Theology spoke against the 
top i c. 

Dr. Hessel, like his cohort Paul Erlich and 
many other prophets of a Population Crisis, got 
his Ph.D. in biology. In the process of study- 
ing the delicate balance between an animal and" 
Its environmental support system, it is nearly 
impossible for one to avoid recognizing that 
the human race is now speeding along a colli- 
slon course with Its suppl'y train and will in 
the next few generations bust through the limits 
of our earth's nuturing womb. Man, through his 
Industrial and medical revolution, has changed 
only one side of the previously balanced equa- 
tion of man's ability to reproduce and his a- 
bility to survive on the one side and the con- 
stant of physical resources on the other. The 
limits of our finite world can not be changed 
appreciably so we must divide our reproduction 
by the same factor that we have multiplied our 
survival. If we don't and we exhaust our resour- 
ces, an exploding death rate wi I I re-balance the 
equation but with the world being able to cup- 
port a much smaller population than before. 

To ca I I the population increase an explo- 
sion is an overstatement some maintain, but 
Hessel reminded us of these facts: it took the 
human race mi I I ions of years to reach the one 
billion mark'in 18 30; it took 100 years to reach 
the two billion mark in 1930; and it will have 
taken 45 years to have topped the four billion 
mark in 1975. The graph of population grow+h 
has changed from a near horizontal line to a 
near vertical line. 

Dr. Hessel prefers not to push his credibility 
by claiming we are now in the midst of a crisis; 
but he does stress the fact that there is such 
a formidable lag between the implementation of 
cant, on page 1 1

Activity Fee Referendum 



important topic of dii 
sioo at the April 21 student as- 
sembly meeting waa the proposed 
scaling of activity fees. 
I An activity fees referendum 
will be mailed to all students. In- 
cluded in the referendum is the pro- 
posal for n new fee structure which 
is scaled in that Students will pay 
according to the number of hours in 
which they are enrolled. 

One advantage of the proposed 
fee ie that a person interested in 
part time activities or athletics 
will not be required to pay full fees. 

Another advantage is that the 
fees of full time students would 

Presently, students over 9 
credit hours must pay $15 while 
students with less than 9 credit 
hours pay only if they wish to have 
an activity card. Five of the $15 
paid by each student per semester 
goes toward athletics. 

Student bodv president Scott 
Gillie said "The proposed fee is 
more equitable in that student ac- 
tivities vital to campus life and 
that all students who utilize the 
campus should contribute to the 
support of those activities and 
should have the opportunity to par-

GRASSROOTS 



REFORM 



PARTY 




John Si merman 
PRESIDENT 




Sunny Miller 
VICE-PRESIDENT 



We of the Grassroots Reform Party are sick and tired of having an in- 
efficient and ineffective student government. We feel that the time is lout 
past due for someone to get in and actively fight for student rights. Time 
after time, the administration has shoved things down our throats, such as 
fee increases, parking fees, etc., without much more than a whimper from 
■ our elected bodies. Wc have the guts that it takes to stand up to our over- 
lords and fight for equitable treatment. The other parties claims are exten- 
sions of their own ideals and philosophies. Ours are no different. However 
the basic difference lies in the fact that our own position is basically 
humanist and directed toward benefitting ALL the students, while many of 
the claims of the opposition are interest group oriented. We are not aligned 
with any political or social groups: wc intend to rely simply on the "corn- 
folk" of the campus for our support. We~arc generally moderate to 
sw, which sets us apart from all of the other parties running, 
e ask all students to carefully consider our platform and if you

Local artists plan display in lounge 



i March 29 
forty paintings from the forty- 
seventh Hoosier Art Salon was 
placed on display in the Indiana- 
Purdue Lounge where it will remain 
u.ilil April 30. The five Fort Wayne 
artists represented in the show arc 
James McBridc, Louis Bonsib, 
Lydia Griffin, David Hockensmith, 
and Lois Pieper, McBride's oil, 
"Autumn Chores" won a Purdue 
purchase award. 

Most of the works are done in 
oils and watercolors. However, 
there is one collage, titled "Our 
Nntiooa] Guard" and one hardware 
display called "Hanikraft". By 
Mildred Hanika, this one features 
thumb tacks, staples, hinges, wire, 
and razor blades. Among the oils 
there is an unusual surrealistic 
puintiag by Todd Hoover titled 
"Oriaslic Number 3". The painting 
by David Hockensmith, "Alterpiecc 
Number 6", seems a little neo-Dali 
and perhaps is making a woman's
