^lidity of New IPSGA Constitution Questioned 



By SAID EL'DAJANI 



Dec. 27, 2007 marked 
the first judiciaj court 
meeting regarding a 
student and current 
member of the Student 
Activities Board (SAB). 
Patrick Deady, inter- 
ested in "olfice jump- 
ing," which according 
to IPSGA Chief Justice 
Colette Ryan, "is when 
someone decides not to 
be in their position any- 
more and decides to go 
to another position be- 
cause of various reasons 
or advantages the posi- 
tion may offer." 

Deady planned to of- 
ficejump by recognizing 
the old consdtudon. The 
more recent document. 



ratified on Dec. 12, 2007, 
is noiv the constitution, 
which does not allow it. 

The first point that 
contradicted Deadys 
series of arguments is 
under Article fV: IPSGA 
Elections, Section I: Elec- 
tion Board, which states 
that Deady would not 
be able to seeek another 
position while holding 
another position. 

Under Article II: Sm- 
dent Activities Board, 
Section I: Membership 
of the Student Acdvilies 
Board, "No petitioned 
Student Activities Board 
member may also be a 
member of any other IP- 
SGA branch." 

Unfortunately, Deady 
saw it otherxvise, 

"I sianed the process 
before the new constitu- 
tion and figured that I 



would be grandfathered 
in by the old one," Deady 
claimed in defense. 

Scrambling to com- 
prehend the new docu- 
ment, more specifically 
Article XIV, 'No portion 
of this Consdtution or 
its Bylaws shall be ret- 
roactively enforced,' the 



to quit his position and 
seek another. 

Since Deady applied 
for a position in another 
branch before the ratifi- 
cation of the new Con- 
stitution, he is hoping 
that he would be able to 
at least resign his current 
position with SAB with 



"The end result of that meet- 
ing was a voting to accept the 
new document as precedence 
to the old one, not yet accredit- 
ing Deady's plea to be eligible." 



judicial court spent the 
majority of the hearing 
questioning the credibil- 
ity and wording of their 
already ratified constitu- 
tion and then whether 
to consider the old one 
which would allow Deady 



time to apply for the elec- 
tion board. Student Body 
President and Vice Presi- 
dent, Aaron Williamson 
and Ryan Brown, respec- 
tively, attended the judi- 
ciaJ process in hopes to 
further clari^ confusion 



and verify the relevance 
of the new constitution. 

Dani Witzigreuterr, 
the iPSGA coordinator 
and faculty advisor also 
assisted in deciphering 
the Constitution in at- 
tempts to smooth delib- 
eration. 

The end result of that 
meeting was a voting to 
accept the new docu- 
ment as precedence to 
the old one, not yet ac- 
crediting Deady's plea to 
be eligible. 

Once established, 
Deady made it clear 
through a note passing 
procedure that he would 
quit the Student Acti- 
vates Board on the spot 
to alleviate a dilemma 
and bring up Article XfV, 
which was his last stand 
for potential eligibility. 

Laughing at his spon- 



taneous request, Chief 
Justice, Colette Ryan 
apologized for not being 
able to at the time dis- 
cern his plea. 

The judicial meeting 
was adjourned mth little 
progress on the matter, 
which was deliberated 
and concluded on a later 
date. Deady, at that point 
was in limbo and still as- 
signed an interview date 
with a chance he might 
resign and still not get 
hired. 

The findings for 
Deady's case came in 
on Jan. 8, 2008 and 
concluded that "office 
jumping" would not be 
allowed on the basis of 
aforementioned articles 
of the Constitution.

With technology 
constantly evolving, stu- 
dents and their instruc- 
tors may find that they 
have a difficult time in- 
stigating and maintain- 
ing interest in the class- 
room. 

However, an updat- 
ed version of an online 
learning program at 
IPFW can bring class in- 
formation online and 
better enable more com- 
munication and inierac- 
tion between students, 
their professors, and also 
their fellow classmates. 

Whenvisitingthe 
!ittp://my.ipfvv.edu web- 
page, a student can click 
on a link on the top right 
corner of the page that is 
called "eLearning". The 
program itself is actually 
called Blackboard, wth 
eLearning being the ge- 
neric term. Blackboard is 
an online learning man- 
agement system that cre- 
ates online classrooms. 

Blackboard is essen- 
tially the same system as 
WebCT, as it is the same 
company but with a dif- 
ferent brand. 



Besides having a dif- 
ferent name, it is also an 
upgraded version of the 
former WebCT and has 
new features that can 
be helpful to both stu- 
dents and faculty. Not al! 
IPfW professors are ac- 
tive users of Blackboard, 
though instructional 
designer Samantha Birk 
estimates tlial approxi- 
mately forty-five to fifty 
percent of IPFW profes- 
sors are active. 

"It's definitely an up- 
grade, but there is not a 
huge change." Birk said, 
"U [Blackboardl is more 
engaging for students 
and faculty." 

Faculty members have 
the option of posting 
blogs via Blackboard. 
These blogs can provide 
information from class or 
direct students to other 
URLs that contain more 
extensive information on 
a certain topic. Students 
can also add content 
onto Blackboard. They 
can provide input and 
like their professors, add 
URLs to help make class 
more engaging. 

Students not only 
have the opportunity to 
experience better com- 
munication with their 



professors, but they can 
also correspond with 
their peers. And individ- 
ual can collaborate or get 
help with assignments 
by talking to their fellow 
classmates via Black- 
board chat rooms, or by 
using their Blackboard 
email accounts. 

Blackboard also en- 
ables students to turn in 
their assignments on- 
line, access their grades 
and view any comments 
or suggestions made by 
their instructors, view a 
calendar that provides 
due dates for assign- 
ments and tests, add 
personal enlries to the 
calendar, and take online 
quizzes and exams. 

Birk recommends that 
IPFW students go to the 
documentation section 
on elearning.iplw.eilu. 
Free hands-on training 
is also available for all 
IPFW instructors, course 
designers and students 
through the Student 
Technology Education 
Programs, or STEPS. By 
doing this, students can 
learn about the program 
and how to make it run 
on their computers as ef- 
ficiently as possible.

IPFW. Using this technol- 
ogy, the mylPFW ponal will 
sec drastically improved us- 
ability, several new key fea- 
tures, and dynamic conieni 
delivery, all via a single user 
uuilicniication. 

Manager of Applica- 
tion Development al IPFW. 



Michael Kannlng explained 
that Ihe project is still in 
heavy development, involv- 
ing user feedback from se- 
lected students, faculty and 
staff. This project will ex- 
pand upon existing features 
lo minimize Ihe learning 
curve for all. As the proj- 
ect is still ongoing, the bulk 
of details arc loo soon for 

After funher prodding, 
Mich.icl Kannlng leaked 
one of the major fcotuics 
called "Group Studio." This 
will tw of incredible interest 
to all oflicial orgnnizaiions 
on campus. It will provide 
an easy means for siudenis 
and siatT lo niunngc dedicat- 
ed web sites, which include 
collaboration loots such as 



chai, message txiards, calen- 
dars, and hie/photo sharing 

What would normally 
require intense development 
for a single well funded 
IPFW organization is pro- 
vided lo all groups with case 
through Ihe power of Lumi- 
nis. Additionally, siudcnis, 
faculty and staff can manage 
affiliations widi any numlxr 
of these organizations a|1 in 
one place— truly dynamic

Mr. Kanning explained 
that the complcie picture 
would likely be. available 
sometime in late February. 
Readers can expect further 
coverage us development 
continues.

Generation Next: A painless introduction to 
investing for the teens, twenties and beyond 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 



College is expensive, 
life is expensive, and 
studeni loan debt is in- 
creasing. According to a 
recent USA Today article, 
undergraduate students 
borrowed, on average, 
$19,300 from al] sources, 
up from S12,1DD a de- 
cade earlier The volume 
of federal government 
loans rose 137 percent 
in 1992 to S20.7 billion in 
2002. 

As a student, invest- 
ment is necessary. For 
your future, graduate 
school, marriage and/or 
2.5 kids and a minivan. 
Whatever ihe flavor of 
your expectations, the 
odds are good that you'll 
need a ncsl egg for up- 
coming adventures. 

But tlie thoughi of 
investing, or giving up 
money ihat you could 



use immediately for, 
say, a case of beer or a 
tank of gas, in favor of 
the intangible is intimi- 
dating. 

These are the facts, 
however: the current 
generation of college 
students is not invest- 
ing efficiently, if at all; 
and truth be told, in- 
vesting is not as impos- 
sible as it seems - even 
when you're scraping 
underneath your sofa 
seats forTaco Bell mon- 
ey. 

The mere thought of 
investing may strike fear 
into the heart of people 
on small, or even large 
budgets, but it doesn't 
need lo be that way. So 
stop, breathe and re- 
lax. Ejiperts say that by 
starting off vvith small 
steps to investing for 
the future, the path will 
become much smooth- 
er as time passes. 



So-do you buy that $5 
tatte with extra foam or 
put it into a higher-yield- 
ing savings account? Well, 
the choice is yours but by 
tucking back even spare 
change and employing 
compound interest to 
work on your side, the end 
result is the beginning of a 
major nest egg. 

Why should a college 
student even worry about 
building a financial cush- 
ion anyway? 

That is a question that 
will be explored weekly 
throughout this semes- 
ter, and if you have an 
investment question 

that you would like to 
have answered, please e- 
mail Jessie Ruckman at 
Ruckil01@ipfiv,edu. But 
remember, investing is 
NOT a four-letter word 
and need not strike fear 
into the heart of Genera- 
ijon Next,

Democracy spreads as women push change 



By EDWARD NELSON 



It is a nation en- 
grossed in political tur- 
moil, fighting a war 
against terrorism and 
delermined to protect 
[he ideals of dcmocrac)' 
within its borders. Al- 
though these conditions 
seem familiar to United 
States citizens, the peo- 
ple of Pakistan know 
them all too well. 

In late December, tlie 
assassination of Benazir 
Bhutto, former leader of 
die Pakistan Peoples Par- 
ty (PPP). thrust the coun- 
try' into further chaos. 

Being elected prime 
minister before in 1988, 
not only was Bhutto the 
first female leader of an 
Islamic nation, she also 
symbolized democracy 
and had the fiiU support 
of Washington in her at- 



tempt to ivin the upcom- 
ing national election. It 
seemed that her presi- 
dency would have en- 
couraged stabiht&gt;' in the 
nuclear-armed country, 
strengthened democracy 
and weakened terrorist 
while encouraging closer 
ties to the U.S. 

Ayaz Malik, Pakistani 
native and prominent 
member of Fort Wayne's 
Islamic population, said 
that the direction Paki- 
stan should begin em- 
bark upon is extremely 
ambiguous and perhaps 
a democrac)' would not 
even benefit them in the 
short run. 

"Pakistani's are most- 
ly familiar with military' 
rule, "Malik said. "Ever&gt;'- 
thing that I've witnessed 
from afar is pure corrup- 
tion no matter what the 
outcome was," 

While Pakistan finds 



itself at a political cross- 
roads looking for a better 
answer, halfway around 
tlie world the U.S. finds 
itself searching for 
change as well. The 
Democratic Party rests 
its theme upon being 
an advocate of change. 
One glimpse at Barack 
Obama's website Barack- 
Obama.

order giving U.S. citizens 
a peek at the daily con- 
cerns of Pakistanis. For 
example, 9/11 has given 
Americans a taste of ter- 
rorist attacks, and as a 
result are unsure of how 
to proceed. Americans 
have also been reminded 
what a longstanding war 
feels like with the cur- 
rent War 
in Iraq. 

Citi- 
zens of 
America 
are also 
familiar 



his "Stand for Change with the lack of confi- 
Tour" and his "Change dence in a leader, as re- 
We Can Believe In" poll- fleeted by Busli's low ap- 



cies. It seems that Hillary 
Clinton has also tried to 
appear as an instrument 
of change in the past few 
weeks. 

Relatively recent 

events have saturated 
America in political dis- 



proval rating which Fox 
News recently reported 
was only at 36 percent. 

In Pakistan and the 
U.S., the need for action 
has arisen and in both 
cases women have an- 
swered the call. Bhutto 



promised change and 
the institution of demo- 
cratic principles. For 
the first time in the na- 
tion's history, America 
has found itself with 
the potential of having 
a female president with 
the candidacy of Hillary 
Clinton. She promises to 
woo America's concerns 
with healthcare and the 
War in Iraq among many 
other concerns. 

After further inspec- 
tion they have a lot in 
common though. Paki- 
stan is a Middle Eastern 
countrj' built upon Is- 
lamic principle whereas 
America is a Western 
countrj' centered around 
democratic ideas. They 
seem very different at a 
glance. 

Both countries are en- 
gulfed in political uncer- 
tainty and are looking to 
change for an answer. 



Although Bhutto was 
assassinated, her ideas 
have made an imprint in 
Pakistani politics and her 
legacj' will live on. 

Whether or not Clin- 
ton will become our next 
president will have to 
wait until November, but 
she has certainly brought 
out ideas that will not go 
ignored. The direction 
tJiat the two countries ivill 
go into may be unknoivn 
but change appears to be 
on the agenda. 




Graduate school: Is the piece of paper worth the moneyi 



By KATY ANDERSON 



A common belief 
among young adults is 
that the higher the level 
of one's education, the 
better the job and the 
bigger the paycheck. 

Besides the future 
monetary benefits, a stu- 
dent may have a genuine 
passion for a particu- 
lar subject and wish to 
become more knowl- 
edgeable in that field or 
desires a career that re- 
quires such an extensive 
education. Whatever the 



case may be, some stu- 
dents may be consider- 
ing graduate school after 

receiving their bachelor's 

Benjamin Franklin 
once said "an investment 
in knowledge always pays 
the best interest." Andy 
Downs, IPFW profes- 
sor of political science, 
seems to agree ivith this. 

"Education... is always 
a good investment," said 
Downs. "It is imponant 
that we be open to learn- 
ing throughout our lives 
and lake advantage of the 
opportunities that pres- 
ent themselves. Gradu-

ate school is a formal op- 
portunit&gt;' to learn that is 
unlike any other learning 
opportunity." 

While expanding 

one's knowledge can be 
both intellectually and 
monetarily rewarding, 
there are a few caveats to 
consider before advanc- 
ing an education. 

One factor to consid- 
er before attending grad 
school is the expense. A 
recent study conducted 
by the National Center 
for Education Statistics 
indicated that about 50 
percent of recent col- 
lege graduates have stu- 
dent loans, with a debt of 
$10,000. 

If attending gradu- 
ate school, a student can 
expect to add thousands 
of dollars more to that 
debt. 

The average tuitions 
for one year of law school 
or medical school aver- 
age more than S20,QQ0, 
while non-professional 
graduate degrees average 



slightiyunderS2O,OO0per 
year according to grad- 
schooltips.com. A few of 
the many other expenses 
that accrue during grad- 
uate school also include 
textbooks, rent, grocer- 
ies, transportation, and 
insurance. 

While these expenses 
may sound a bit daunt- 
ing, a student also has the 
option of seeking finan- 
cial aid to help pay for 
their education, A higher 
education in many, but 
not all, cases can entail 
a better job and a better 
salary, making payment 
for college debts less 
painful. 

If the financial bur- 
den of graduate school 
does not completely in- 
timidate a potential stu- 
dent, one should also re- 
member to consider the 
amount of time and work 
required to perform well 
in school. 

In order to earn a 
PhD, a student can ex- 
pect to spend anoth- 



er four to six years in 
school, and law school 
tj^pically takes three to 
four years to complete. 
Graduate school lertds to 
also be very competitive 
among students, making 
it even more difficult to 
participate in social and 
leisurely activities. 

Though attending 
graduate school can bol- 
ster a student's resume 
and career opportunities, 
one should also remem- 
ber that such a degree is 
not always necessary and 
that a bachelor's degree 
is not obsolete. 

"Graduate school is 
not for everyone and not 
every career requires a 
graduate degree," Dovms 
said. 

"Although research 
shows, in aggregate, that 
people ivith graduate de- 
grees make more money 
than those without them, 
a graduate degree is not 
necessary to find a job 
or to make a comfortable 
living," 



A bachelor's 
is broader than a degree 
obtained through gradu- 
ate school, but still dra- 

teer opportunities and 
salaries available to an 
individual. According to 
the U.S. Bureau of Labor, 
a professional who has 
earned a bachelor's de- 
gree earns S900 per week, 
while a worker with only 
a high school educa- 
tion earns only S554 per 
week, or about sixty-two 
percent less than a col- 
lege graduate. 

Though graduate 
school can be very ben- 
eficial to one's future, 
one has to keep in mind 
the sacrifices required 
to be successful. Before 
becoming submerged in 
more student debt and 
work, an extensive cost- 
benefit analysis may be 
in order. If the positive 
outcomes outweigh the 
negative, then perhaps 
graduate school may suit 
a student.

Move Over, 
YouTube: 
Hulu.com is 
the Web's 
Next Big 
Video Site 




By DOUGLAS SCHMIDT 

chmdnOISipfw edij 



Throw away the TV 
Guide. Everything is on 
all the time at holu.coni. 
NBC and Fox have com- 
bined forces to build one 
of the net's largest video 
portals. 

The site features 
streaming video from 
both channels and their 
families of networks: 
FX, Bravo, the Sundance 
Channel, Sci Fi and 
more. 

Programming in- 
cludes complete epi- 
sodes of current hits like 
"Heroes" and "The Of- 
fice," recent favorites like 
"Arrested Development" 
and "BufTy the Vampire 
Slayer" and classic shows 



like "W/KRP in Cincinna- 
ti" and "The A- Team. " 

The site also features 
movies from TXventieth 
Century Fox and Uni- 
versal. Currently, only 
seven films are avail- 
able, none new releases. 
However, new content 
is still being added, so 
this could change soon. 

New episodes of cur- 
rent shows are added 
to the site by midnight 
on the day they air. Epi- 
sodes are only available 
for a few weeks so, in 
that sense, the site func- 
tions more like an online 
DVR than a comprehen- 
sive video archive. Fans 
may still wish to invest 
in DVDs of their favorite 
shows. 

Compared to televi- 
sion, the ads on http:// 



hulu.com are remarkably 
brief and inconspicuous. 
Programs are shown with 
commercials, but breaks 
are only 30 seconds long 
or less. 

The site also overlays 
small, transparent ban- 
ners at the bottom of 
the videos similar to the 
"screen bugs" frequently 
seen on TV. 

The site has already 
drawn comparisons to 
http://youtube.com. Both 
sites allow users to share 
videos in their websites or 
lilogs. Shows from hitp:// 
hulu.com can be shared 
in fiJl, or users can imbed 
just their favorite moment 
from an episode or movie. 

However, while http:// 
youtube.com is designed 
primarily to host user- 
generated content, http:// 



huiu.com is exclusively 
for television and films. 
Users are able to rate vid- 
eos but not upload any 
of their own. Programs 
on http://hulu.com are 
in higher resolution than 
videos on http://you- 
tube.com and are much 
clearer when viewed in 
full screen mode. 

The site is currently 
going through private 
beta testing. Interested 
readers can register at 
http://hulu.com to be 
emailed an invitation or 
ivait a few weeks for the 
site to be open to 
general public. Video 
content from http:// 
hulu.com can also be 
seen at http:/ /television, 
aol.com, http://ivww. 
fancast.com and other 
sites around the Web.

Top Ten Celebrity 
Predictions for 2008 



By SARAH GEIGER 

geigse02eipt\v.edu 



Fall Overboard 



For Ingrid 
Michaelson 



I have this list posted on my refrigerator, as each 
one comes true, they will be marked off the list. I ex- 
pect you, the reader, to do exactly the same. 

10) Lindsay Lohan will end up in rehab AGAIN, I 
.aay.thisbecause she's back to her old anrics. Perezhil- 
ton.com showed her in Capri recently making out 
with some random Italian guy, on the same night she 
reportedly dropped S700 on alcohol for herself and 
the La- Lohan posse. 

9) New York and Tailor Made will break off their 
engagement Seriously, she picked him out of a hand- 
ful of losers looking for fame, this has tragedy written 
all over it. 

8) Lily Allen and boyfriend Ed Simons ivill most 
likely end up engaged before the birth of their child 
or after the birth. I could be wrong, he is old enough 
to be her dad, if memory serves me correct he's like 



7) Britney Spears ivill go BATSHIT INSANE!! (I 
wrote this like a week before current happenings 
occurred. I was right, but 1 feel like "batshit insane" 
doesn't really define the rocker she fell off.) 

6) Nicole Ritchie and Joel Madden will not only 
pop out a bundle of joy, but ivill probably elope in 
a lavish fashion, that will be "completely spur of the 
moment". Spur of the moment totally includes the 
custom designed Galliano dress. 

5) Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt will end their 
relationship. They will probably do this at least 10 
times this year just to keep their faces in the media 

4)Brangelina will either be preggers or adopt an- 
other foreign rugrat by the year's end. She has been 
wearing clever belly covering pieces. I say she's preg- 
nant. 

3) Hayden Panettiete and Milo Ventimiglia will 
go public with their relationship, this move will ulti- 
mately end such a relationship, quite promptly. 

2) Jamie-Lynn Spears will reveal that her baby 
daddy is not Casey Aldridge. but some Nickelodeon 
CEO she was having a secret affair with. 

I ) Bret Michaels will still not find love. He will only 
find girls with STDs and will most likely acquire them

Her music has been 
featured in some of the 
most emotional scenes 
of today's hot television 
series 'Grey's Anatomy.' 
She can also be beard 
during the Old Navy and 
JC Penny commercials 
and her music peaked 
at number six on the 
iTunes Music Store. 

Ingrid Michaelson is 
one of tlie best new in- 
die pop artists to hit the 
scene. She gained rec- 
ognition through most 
prominent television 
shows and endorse- 
ments from promi- 
nent actors like Zach 
BraFf. Based out of New 
York, Michaelson never 
toured very much un- 
til last year where she 
recently finished up a 
tour that went straight 
through Ann Arbor, 
Michigan. 

Ingrid Michaelson 
gave the best perfor- 
mance I've seen to date. 
I was lucky enough to 
see her on Dec. 16 at 
the Blind Pig. It was well 
worth the drive - her 
performance was aston- 
ishingly entertaining. 

Michaelson's perfor- 
mance began softly. She 



played the key- 
board and sang 
into the mic, en- 
trancing the en- 
tire audience of 
young and old 
alike. The silence 
left by her pierc- 
ing voice was 
palpable - that is, 
until she finished. 
As the last notes 
from her song 
were still fading 
into the air. the 
audience erupted 
in a cacophony of 
cheering, 

Michael- 
son is charming 
and pleasant, 
drawing the au- 
dience in, telling 
them the stories 
behind many 
of the songs she 
sang. Michaelson 
embodied beauty, car- 
rying emotion so well 
in her songs with pain, 
angst, and elations of 
love evident on her face. 
She brought humor to 
the stage, keeping the 
audience laughing and 
listening intently to her 
every word, spoken and 
sung. 

Michaelson 
was down to earth yet 
angelic all the while, 
flowing through her set 
keeping everyone's in-

terest poised upon her 
throughout the two- 
hour show. There wasn't 
one person who left that 
night who wasn't a litde 
bit in love with Ingrid 
Michaelson. 

Many artists who 
perform seem to be 
ethereal, almost inhu- 
man in their celebrity. 
Michaelson lets her hu- 
manity show in a way 
that was refreshing and 
endearing. As a singer, 
songwriter, performer, 
and a person, she im- 



pressed me. She admit- 
ted her clumsy nature 
and shared her wacky 
thoughts. She was char- 
ismatic and brought 
a new meaning to the 
word entertainment. 
She enchanted every- 
one in attendattce and, 
left them begging for 
more. 

Michaelson is al- 
ready touring again, 
check out her MySpace 
or Facebook for more 
information. This is one 
show you won't want to 
miss.

Diamond in the rough, the college 
dropout dream: Part Two 




BySaidEI-Oajani 

Timbaland, the vi- 
sionary and creative di- 
rection behind music 
that has given light to 
out of nowhere bands 
like "Apologize's" On- 
eRepublic, has teams of 
engineers to do a lot of 
the dhry work For his art- 
ists. Dirty work includes 
tracking, mbcing, and 
mastering music before 
it's duplicated and mass 
distributed. 

For the less experi- 
enced, dirty work could 
be the key to the good life 
- a good life Timbaland 
explains on his websites 
bio as "persistent and 
disciplined." 

As a senior in voice 
performance at IPFW, 
Meg Lotbamer believes 
'education and a degree 
is a stable platform- 
something lo back you 
up. It's not just luck and 
about who you know. It's 
about what you know, 
which I think is more im- 
portant." 

Lothamer looks for- 
ward to continuing her 
education, planning to 



her masters, which 
will help her perform and 
teach opera or classical 
music, "'what or which 
ever pays the rent." 

Carl Bleke's home stu- 
dio was once his dad's 
old home. Lucky for him- 
self and roommate, Steve 
Spears, living before the 
new year ivithout paying 
rent, they had the time 
and tools to work on mu- 
sic. 

With less than 24 
hours to finish their stage 
of production, it is clear 
Bleke and Eshghi need 
an extension. The work 
got to them late and the 
importance of getting the 
work done fast was not 
emphasized, rhe excuse 
didn't matter, for those 
cats were screwed. 

"Alicia Keys doesn"t 
use "Auto 'Rine', a tool 
Melodyne, a sound ma- 
nipulating software of- 
fers - there are a lot of 
options to make music 
sound goad," justifies 
Spears, who has been 
workingwitbthesoftware 
religiously since produc- 
ers like T-Pain and Kanye 
West acknowledged its 
demand and ingenuity. 



Matt Pokora, the 
French artist, has a style 
and approach to music 
production that requires 
tedious sound modula- 
tion - production that 
Timbaland, who may 
have dozens of projects 
at one time, has little 
guys work on - litde guys 
without degrees. 

In fact, the majority of 
'pop"ular music is tech- 
nologically enhanced. 
The demand for perfect 
sound is high, and artists 
worldwide are paying 
high euro to find their 
niche and exploit it radi- 
cally. These days unfortu- 
nately, most universities 
don't offer unorthodox 
experimental methods of 
making music that most 
artist with successful ca- 
reers are looking for. 

The little guys like Es- 
hghi and Bleke are a part 
of a team responsible 
for giving French people 
what they want to hear- 
an audibly aesdielic hit 
that can land everybody 
in the process some- 
where between great 
steak and Justin Timber- 
lake.

IPFW student 

crusades for end 
to Darfur crisis 




By RACHEL UTESCH 
Campus Ministfy 
Student Leader 



It's hard to say when 
1 first heard the word 
"Darfur." Immediately 
aheri had learned about 
"the" situ allbri in Darfur, 
Sudan, 1 could not slay 
quiel. Something needed 
to be done, and my heart 
was telling me to GO! 

I logged on lo www. 
savedarfur.org, and 

emailed a contact person 
to find someone in Fort 
Wayne I could connect 
with. I found Beth Reilly. 
and this staned the be- 
ginning of a great friend- 
ship and a cause that 
would consume me... 

1 registered a STAND 
{www.standnow.org) 
chapter online, which 
stands for "Students Tak- 
ing Action Now: Darfur", 
however the name has 
been changed STAND 
since many humanitar- 
ian crises will occur and 
they want lo be a part 
of them, not jusi Darfur. 
STAND'S outreach team, 
comprised of both Re- 
gional and State Coor- 
dinators, is made up of 
more than 20 dedicated 
high school and college 
students around the 
country. 

Coordinators work 
to unify and empower 
STAND chapters by pro- 
viding strategic guidance 
and resources. The group 
also has an international 
division, including chap- 
ters in 25 countries such 
as England, China, Can- 
ada, Sierra Leone, Singa- 
pore, and Israel, 

As a ^iludeni division 
of the Genocide Inter- 



vention Network (wvvw. 
genocideinlervenlion. 
netl, their long-term 
goal is !0 establish a per- 
manent anti-genocide 
constituency that holds 
elected officials account- 
able for doing all that 
they can to prevent and 
end genocide. 

ThefirsleventatlPE^ 
was in 2006. We invited 
Brian Sleidle, former ma- 
rine captain who served 
as U,S. Representative to 
the African Union Peace- 
keeping Mission in Dar- 
hir from September 2004 
- February 2005. 

He came to our Uni- 
versity as part of his cur- 
rent mission "Tour for 
Darfur: Eyewitness to 
Genocide" a 21,000 mile 
tour in 1 1 states. His goal 
was to raise awareness 
and motivate others to 
take action. 

We decided to make 
this event part of the 
Global Christian Fellow- 
sliip's cause. 

With this, we also cel- 
ebrated Sudan's culture, 
enjoying some Darfurian 
women cook authentic 
food and played a game 
to understand their cul- 
ture better. We had a 
candlelight ceremony/ 
moment of silence for 
Darfurian people in tran- 
sition to Brian's speech. 

There were letters to 
write to representatives, 
an offering, a DPADO 
(later explained) sign- 
up, my email sign-up for 
STAND and Save Darfur 
bracelets to buy. 

The firsi meeting 1 
had to congregate peo- 
ple who were interested 
was on April 24, 2006, 
We heavily brainstormed 
on ideas for our STAND 



chapter. That very week 
was the "Invisible Chil- 
dren" event, so we didn't 
really have lime to help 
with that. 

Then on April 29 there 
was a Global Night Com- 
mute where everyone 
was invited to walk in the 
city that night and then 
spend the night outside 
at Taylor University Fort 
Wayne. I was not able to 
go to either. However, 
I did end up watching 
a video made from the 
makers of "Imnsible Chil- 
dren ', about specific chil- 
dren in Uganda. 

I had so much emo- 
tion brewing inside of 
mu. Throughout the 
mij\ie, I was so touched 
by the children, to the 
babies wi\h snot run- 
ning down their noses, to 
those in wheelchairs on 
the dirt, to tons of teens 
in a group, to the four 
Americans who decided 
to be "displaced", to the 
actual "Displace Me" 
footage that happened 
in target cities across the 
U.S. this year (hltp:// 
www.invisibiechildren. 
com/displaceMe/). 

These children were 
ir&gt;'ing to visible, but 
were invisible. There 
are so many questions 
left unanswered in Af- 
rica. 1 care so much — (on 
much il hurls to breathe 
anymore. It hurls to eal 
knowing some are eal- 
ing rats or nothing. It 
hurts to drink my coffee 
or sleep in my bed or to 
take a shower. 

Beth attended 
the Rally for Darfur in 
Washington on April 30, 
2006. 1 wanted to go so 
badly, but 1 could not. 
She was more passionate 
when she got back, and 
had tons of postcards 
from the rally for people 
to sign and send to the 
president. 

Beth created the In- 
diana Coalition to Save 
Darfur (within Save 
Darfur's website) Sep- 
tember 13, 2006 and 1 
became a member Oc- 
tober 23, 2006. Through 
correspondence with 
e-mail, we coordinate 
statewide action and 
events to strengthen the 
efforts of community 
groups in South Bend, 
Fort Wayne, Indianapolis 
and Bloomington. Sadly, 
Beth moved to Maryland 
to be closer lo her family 
and her husband's job in 
September 2007. 

On a Campus Min- 
istry retreat the Fall of 
2006, we were having a 
time of solitude and si- 
lence, and 1 had written 
in my journal. 1 was qui- 
eting my hear! by writing 
down ihings that were 
on my mind, questions, 
concerns, etc. 

I was fortunate to 



connect with the Darfur 
Peace and Development 
Organization (DPADO) 
(www. dp ado. org) be- 
cause my older brother 
designed their websile, 
and I also went to church 
with the Schools Coor- 
dinator. Karri DeSelm, 
Their motto is "Promot- 
ing peace, justice, and 
sustainable develop- 
ment." 

This was a local group 
tiial actually had connec- 
tions and people working 
□n the ground in Darfur, 
building schools and 
things like thai. Sadly, 
in August 2007 they re- 
located to Washington, 
D,C, I guess for the bel- 
ter, but I am stilt sad they 
are gone. 

Karri also moved lo 
Philadelphia, to attend 
Eastern University for 
economic development, 
and then moving to South 
Africa iviih her husband 
to apply her knowledge 
and help women develop 
skills. 



The winter of 2006, i 
went to a massive con- 
ference in St, Louis called 
Urbana. It is a Christian 
conference for people all 
over the world, and they 
focus on missions and 
humanitarian organiza- 
tions. It was a life-chang- 
ing conference for me. 

1 learned a lot, and 
was able to collect more 
materials to feed my 
brain about what the 
world has to offer. You 
know what? 

The world is not com- 
pletely cold and heart- 
less: tliere are many, 
many people out there 
who care like I do. There 
are many, many orga- 
nizations out there that 
care like I do. This was 
very refreshing and I 
decided Darfur was my 
calling.

Buddy Up for Fitness program introduced 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

niiijIDieipfwedii 

It's a New Vear, 
and according to the 
Washington Post gening 
fit is in the 10 most 
popular goals for the 
post holiday fat fest. 
However, 60-70 percent 
of the people who hit 
the gym in lanuary have 
abandoned it by July. 

The Gates Sports 
Center and The 
Communicator have 
teamed up to create a 
resolution of their own- 
to get people into the 
gym and make it a habit. 

Buddy Up For 
Fitness! is a new program 
launched by Judy 
ntlapaugh, R.D. 

Coordinator of 

the wellness/ fitness 

programs at GSC which 



vvillpairupthosestudents 
who are interested 
in tilness, but need 
3 for support and 

"The buddy up 
system is really good 
because people are more 
likely to go to a fitness 
center if they are meeting 
someone else who is also 
interested in fitness," 
saidTillapaugh. 

The program will be a 
"rolling admission" style, 
so there is no deadline 
for turning in the buddy 
up card. The sooner the 
better, however, because 
the goaJ is for each pair 
to hit the gym three days 
every week throughout 
the spring semester. 

"The benefits would 
be enormous, like de- 
stressing, friendsips and 
a stronger bod/" said 
TiUapaugh. Studies have 



shown that it generally 
takes at least a month for 
^ost habits to form. 
I "Ithinksome students 
.would be interesied, but 
working out can also be 
personal. If people are 
new to working out, it 
would be better to have 
someone there with 
you." said Jesse Craig, 
sophomore. 

Below is a form to 
be filled out and turned 
into the Gates Sports 
Center information 

desk. Upon turning in 
the information, you will 
receive a 'getting started' 
packet with a multitude 
of information, and you 
will be paired up with 
a partner within days. 
For more information, 
contact ludy TiUapaugh 
at 260-481-6647 or at 
Till apau@ipfw.edu.

IPFW falls short in opener, prepare for BYU 



By DAN VANCE 

vancdjai9lpfw.edu 

Ohio Slate finally got 
a chip off their shoulder 
and promptly placed it 
on IPFW's. The Buckeyes 
avenged a loss in the 
2007 MIVA title match 
with a 3-2 win over the 
Mastodons last Friday 
night; 25-30, 30-28, 25- 
30, 30-21 and 15-6. 

Senior Ail -American 
C.I. Macias led the 
Mastodons as usual, this 
time with 23 kills. It was 
the best opening match 
for Macias, kill-wise, in 
his IPFW career. 

"We are certainly 
disappointed in the 
loss," said IPFW coach 
Amie Ball. "We were in 
a position to win and we 
let it get away from us." 

Jason Yhost followed 
Macias ivith 14 kills and 
a team high six blocks 

Senior Brock Ullrich 
was surprisingly quiet 
with eight kills. He 
also had eight errors in 
contributing to IPFW's 



rough .192 hitting. The Rogers and Josh Stewart 

Buckeyes hit .338, led by as weL as freshman 
Oliver Kook will all batde 
for a spot in the middle 
according to Ball. 

But the biggest 
compelilion this season 
may be at libero where 
sophomore Matl Pliske 
will look to hold onto 
his spot ivith the return 



senior John Albertson 
who had 15 kills and hit 
.700 for the match. 

The major change 
for the Mastodons was 
at the setter position 
where senior Graydon 
Ainsworth took over for 
graduated Academic 
AU-American Colin _ 
Luhdeen, who helped 
the Mastodons to the 
Final Four in each of 
his two seasons. 

"We thought he 
held his own. He . 

certainly made some 

decisions that we'd like of Mike Morici, who sat 
back but that happens out injured last season. 
quite often early on," Ball Pliske started against the 



"You have to play good 
teams, it doesn't matter 
where they come from." 



said about Ainsworth, 

who had 48 assists. 

The emergence of 
the senior Ainsworth 
also bring aboul part 
of the competition for 
spots with the team this 



Buckeyes with 17 di] 
Morici played in three of 

the five games. 

"It's very healthy," 
Ball noted of the 
competition. 

The competition and 



1. Ainsworth will be early defeat will give way 

fighting with sophomore to a big home opener this 

Corey Stewart at setter, Friday when the nation's 

freshman Daryl Shank top-ranked BYU Cougars 

viiW compete at outside make their first ever visit

With the Saunders 
SS Sabres, Shank 
was a three-time 
Quad-A Provincial

was also named 
Volleyball Most 
Valuable Player.

"You like to have it 
happen," Ball said of 
bringing in west coast 
teams. "But you have 
to play good teams, it 
doesn't matter where 
they come from," 

Ball however is excited 
about having the bullseye 
on the team's back as 
the defending national 
runner up, saying 
that the only way it 
could be bigger is to 
ivin the whole thing, 
but he would take this 
bullseye every year. 
- BYU was named 
atop the first AVCA 
Poll of the year as the 
nation's top team but is 
currently ranked second 
in their own conference: 
the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation, 

behind the UC Irvine 
Antealers. The Cougars 
opened their season with 
3-1 and 3-0 victories over 
UC San Diego. 

IPFW will be on ihc 
road again Saturday as 
they face Mercyhurst 
in their second MIVA 
conference match.
