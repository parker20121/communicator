Child care issue resurfaces 



By Not T. Berkley 
Starf Writer 

According to the 1990 Indiana 
Parent Project study, child care is 
the "number one challenge" for 
northeast Indiana residents seeking 
education. 

Due to the expressed needs of 
many IPFW parents, a student 
sponsored proposal addressing 
their child care needs will be 
brought to the floor of the student 
senate in the near future. 

If a child care bill is passed, this 
will not be the first time IPFW has 
provided child care. From 1970 to 
1992, IPFW offered child care for 
students, faculty and staff. 

Today IPFW is the only IU- 
Purduc affiliate without a child 



care center. 

At the recent convocation, 
Frank Borelli, vice chancellor of 
Student Affairs, announced that 
providing on-campus child care 
would be a 1994-95 administrative 
priority. 

Borelli said that IPFW learned 
the hard way about child care: In 
1986, IPFW formed a child care 
consortium with Ivy Tech and the 
State Developmental Center. Four 
years later. Parkview Hospital 
entered the consortium and built a 
new state of the art center. 

Borelli said that, due to unex- 
pected expenses, IPFW withdrew 
from the consortium in December 
of 1992. 

The goal is to establish a per- 
manent child care center by the 



1995 fall semester, Borelli said. Memorial Union to provide space 

Julie Junker, an IPFW student for child care facilities. The Child 
who commutes from Columbia Care Task Force, a university corn- 
City, remarked, "This university is mittee composed of faculty and 
supposed to be a community col- students, formed in 1992 and 
lege; to 
mc, that 
means 
they 
should 
listen 
closer to 
students 
with chil- 
dren." 

Junker 
added, "There have been a lot of 
proposals, but nothing has ever 
been done." 

Mark King, student body presi- 
dent, wants to enlarge Walb

moving the pool 

tables for child 

care. "

room or a 
nearby storage facility as a tempo- 
rary home for child care center. 

Removing the game room is not 
an option according to King. King 
said that he will not eliminate one 



student service available to all stu- 
dents to make room for another 
service utilized by a minority of 
students. "I'm sure the senate will 
vote it down," slated King. 

Amy Steenman, vice president 
of legislation, served on the Task 
Force. Steenman said that, 
although she supports child care on 
campus, she doesn't support mov- 
ing the game room for a center. 

"I don't support moving the 
pool tables for child care," 
Steenman remarked. 

King said to his knowledge, no 
student government member has 
children. 

Troy McCormick, a student 
who uses the billiard tables in 
Walb everyday, said, "As long 
there's a place where I can shoot 



pool, I guess it's okay." 

In March of 1994. the Task 
Force mailed a survey to every 
registered student concerning child 
care, Only 4.5 percent answered 
the survey. Thirty-three percent of 
the respondents were dissatisfied 
or unsure about their current child 
care situation. Seventy-nine per- 
cent of the respondents were inter- 
ested in an on-campus child care 
center during class hours, accord- 
ing to the Task Force's report. 

The Task Force report indicated 
that many students sec child care 
as a vital recruitment issue along 
with financial aid and course avail- 
ability. The report also mentioned 
"the perception by IPFW students 
that the university has a casual 
altitude toward their lives." 



Campus evaluates parking, gets student input 



By Carmen Robinson, 

Staff Writer, and 

KristleRkclSchlundi, 

Editor in Chief 

Plans to build a new parking garage 
on the IPFW campus are currently 
underway. 

Lauren DenHartog, IPFW chief of 
university police, Davkl Leeka, director 
of purchasing, and Don Kalter, director 
of the Physical llant were appointed by 
Vice Chancellor of Financial Affairs 
Walt Branson to get university input on 
the issue of expanding IPFW parking 
facilities. 

"We needed to find out whether the 
campus wanted more surface parking 
lots or a parking garage," said 
DenHanog. 

DenHartog, Leeka and Kancr met 
with Student Body President Mark King 
and Vice President of Legislation Amy 
Steenman in July 10 ask for feedback on 
the issue of expanding parking tadlilies. 

Since that time, the trio has met once 
with the full student senate and twice 
with the Unhersity Resource and Policy 
Commioce. which was organized by the 
family senate. They also received feed- 
back from the student body earlier this 
week through an open forum on the 
issue sponsored by student govtsrirncnL 

The majority favor a new parking 



garage over additional surface lots, 
DenHartog said. Bui the question, 
DenHanog continued, is where to pui 
the garage and how to assess payment 
font. 

Kalter explained thai the location of 
tltc garage would be limited by numer- 
ous factors. 

The west side of campus along the St. 
Joe river is not a possible location lor a 
garage, according to Kalter, .because 
much of the property along ihe river is 
part of the River Grecnway. which ihc 
university mainl;iins but does not own. 
The ground by the river is loo soft to 
bear tic weight of a multi-story structure, 
Katler said, and added," We have such a 
beautiful view of the ri\er, we don't want 
to louse it up more than we already 
have," 

The south side of campus is not a 
likely garage site, cither Katler again 
cited acsiheiics as an argument against 
putting a garage near Ketuer Hall and the 
south of the campus. 

The north side of (he campus is so far 
from most of ihe building, Kaner said, 
lhal the existing lots on that pan of cam- 
pus are utKieruulrzed. 

"We have to have a significant net 
gain of parking spaces — to take out 400 
to gain 750 is not reasonable. Also, land 
space needs to be preserved for future 
building additions. Parking needs to be 



close and accessible, but we don't want 
to destroy Ihe aesthetic value of the cam- 
pus," Katler said. 

The area next to ihe tennis courts, 
across from Ihe Gales Sports Center 
appears at this time to be the most likely 
site for a parking garage, Kalter said, 
which may require relocation of Ihe ten- 
nis courts. 

"No stale-appropriated funds are used 
to fund parking facilities. The source is 
parking fees, parking fines and meier 
fines," said Leeka 

Leeka explained that the park- 
ing garage could be paid for through 
incremental increase or by flat fee 



;, and furthermore, could be paid 
on a per-ocdit hour basis or by parking 
fees, which is how parking is currendy 
funded at IPFW. 

Whichever way the fee will be 
assessed, the parking garage would cost 
the same amount of money, Leeka said 
Currently, students pay sixteen 
dollars for an annual parking per- 
mit. The permit fee could be raised 
incrementally through the year 2010 
to S59 and could be paid as a park- 
ing fee or a per credit hour fee; or, a 
flat parking fee of S40 or S2.50 per 
credit hour could be charged to students, 
starting the next academic year.

I.U. President speaks to IPFW students 



By Melissa Young 
Staff Writer 

Indiana University president 
Myles Brand visited IPFW on 
Monday, Sept. 19, and met with 
administrators, faculty and the 
media. He addressed IPFW con- 
cern over annual increases in 
tuition fees. 

In bis meeting with the students, 
Brand attributed the tuition increas- 
es to insufficient stale funding. He 
said the responsibility of pushing 



for funds lo lower the cost of high- 
er education is not only in the 
hands of college and university 
administrators, but also in Ihe 
hands of students and their fami- 
lies. , 

"Students should write ibeir 
own legislators... students should be 
registered lo vole," Brand said. 

In the press conference, Brand 
said that Indiana's colleges and 
universities are working to relieve 
some of (he monetary burden from 
students 



"We have submitted a budget to 
the stale, and Purdue and Indiana 
and indeed all seven state institu- 
tions have marched hand in hand in 
this regard. It took a prudent, ratio- 
nal budget a step forward in contin- 
ued fiscal restraints, and in respect 
to that, Ihe slate will nol raise taxes 
in this biennium," Brand said. 

According to IPFW Chancellor 
Michael Wartcll, the benefits of 
that budget approval lo the Fort 
Wayne campus would include 
technology improvements and 



increases in the n timber of full-time 
faculty. 

"We have a large number of 
associate faculty on [his campus 
that teach part time. One of the 
quality improvements will be 
replacing some part-time faculty 
with full-time faculty and making 
those full-lime faculty more avail- 
able to students. Secondly, where 
we were going to work is expand- 
ing the availability of computers 
and computer labs to students," 
Wartcll said.

IPFW 'runs for the border' 



By Lourdes Tiglao 
Staff Writer 

IPFW students don't have to 
run across the border for Mexican 
food, nor do they have to run to 
Taco Bell. Food from Taco Bell 
will became part of The Canteen's 
menu on Tuesday, Sept. 20. 

The Taco Bell menu will be 
available in The Canteen on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11 a.m. 
lo 2 p.m., throughout the school 
year. 

The new program was devised 
by Candy Hagar, Food Services 
director of The Canteen, and 
implemented by both Taco Bell 
and The Canteen. According to 
Hagar, the program ilself was a 
joint venture for both parties to 
implement "branding" in the 
Canteen. 

Branding, Hagar said, is the 
practice of providing brand-name 
foods among a restaurant's menu 
selections. 

"It will not be replacing the 



Canteen," said Hagar. "The 
Canteen's whole menu will still 
be available." 

Hagar explained that prepared 
Taco Bell food will be delivered 
to the Canteen. The transport will 
result in a price thai is slightly 
higher than the prices charged for 
the same selections at the Taco 
Bell restaurants in town. 

"We've been thinking about 
branding for some time. This pro- 
gram will offer an alternative 
food product for the students 
which is moderately priced and 
easy lo bring around," said Hagar. 
As far as advantages for Taco 
Bell and IPFW, "We hope to draw 
more campus participation and, at 
the same time, increase advertis- 
ing for Taco Bell and the 
Canteen," 

IPFW student Craig Carroll, a 
freshman this year, commented, 
"It's a great idea." 

Carroll's friend Chris Corlew 
added, "Cool! It'll leave more 
lime lo play pool."

Staff Editorial 



"Wc arc gelling a child care cen- 
ter. We jusi need 10 find n suitable 
site." Sound familiar? 

Is IPFW going to negotiate about 
child care unlit the year 20007 
Prank Borelli, vice chancellor of 
Student Affairs, said lhat a perma- 
nent child care center is targeted for 
1995. This sounds quite familiar, 

In 1995. they will probably still 
be negotiating over where the site 
for child care will be. 

Of course, some of out student 
government representatives feel lhat 
pool tables and game rooms arc 
much more valuable than a center 
for adults to bring their children. 



According to your student body 
president and vice president of leg- 
islation, student government is not 
going to eliminate such resources as 
pool tables and game rooms 
because the majority of students do 
not need child care. Oh, really? 

The Communicator would be 
very interested la know what data 
the student government has to back 
up this claim. Are wc mistaken in 
our belief lhat ihc mission of IPFW 
is to offer ADULT education in a 
reasonably mature, academic envi- 
ronment? 

If you will recall, the majority of 
studcnis mi this campus are female. 



with an average age of 27. How 
many of these women were person- 
ally surveyed for their opinions on 
the subject? 

Remember, student government 
is considered to be the official voice 
of the student body. Are they really 
talking for the majority of stu- 
dents? Our guess is NO! 

Wc at The Communicator arc 
going to lake a wild guess: We'd 
lay odds lhat members of the pre- 
dominately male student govern- 
ment do not have children and are 
not therefore real concerned about 
the issue of child care. What do you 
think?

Breaking barriers between students, police 



By Lauren DenHarlog 
Chief of Police 

I have been given the opportuni- 
ty, thanks to The Communicator 
staff, to let you know a little bil 
about the University Police and 
Safety department. 

The University Police and Safely 
department consists of ten police 
officers, Tour security officers, three 
clerk dispatchers and two student 
workers. Police officers are on duty 
24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 
University police officers are certi- 
fied through the Indiana Law 
Enforcement Training Board and 
have full police powers. Police offi- 
cers have jurisdiction on campus 
and throughout the city of Fort 
Wayne. 

The Police and Safety depart- 
ment's mission statement is "To 
protect and serve the campus com- 
munity by providing a safe environ- 
ment through enforcement, service 
and education." 

We offer many services to the 
campus community and encourage 
staff, faculty and students to use 
them. Services include: vehicle 
jump starts and unlocks, personal 



escorts anytime day or night, 
engraving of identification numbers 
on personal property, and more. 
Officers handled over 2,000 of 
these requests for service last year. 
Please do not hesitate to use these 
services. 

One of the most common ques- 
tions lhat I receive is, "Why were 
the campus police officers, off-cam- 
pus making a traffic slop?" There' 
are many reasons for this. When 
officers cannot always stop a viola- 
tor on campus, the safest place to 
stop a vehicle may be off-campus. 
Officers also patrol the adjacent 
roads to the campus. Many people 
ask. "Why?" Our job is to keep the 
campus community as safe as possi- 
ble. In recent years many students, 
staff and faculty have been involved 
in accidents at intersections such as 
Anthony and Coliseum, Broyles 
and Si. Joe and Crescent and 
Coliseum. Several members of our 
community were killed or injured in 
these accidents. Wc patrol these 
areas in hopes of making more peo- 
ple aware that there is a penalty for 
running a red light, and thus save 
lives or prevent injuries. 
Unfortunately, if you arc the person 



thai we slop, it is not always easy to 
sec that wc are just trying to do our 
jobs to protect the citizens of the 
campus community. 

When we write parking tickets, 
we are trying to make sure lhat each 
person in the campus community 
has access to the same parking priv- 
ileges as everyone else. I know that 
doesn't make a S10 ticket any easi- 
er to pay, bul we are just trying to 
do our job. If you don't agree with a 
parking ticket, it can be appealed at 
the Police and Safety office. 

Wc also work closely wilh the 
Fort Wayne Police Department. Wc 
ofien need their help. Wc in turn 
will respond to nearby locations and 
help the Fori Wayne Police 
Department when they request our 
assistance. 

We are concerned for the safety 
of everyone on the IPFW campus, 
but wc need your help to keep the 
campus safe. If you see something 
suspicious, report il to us immedi- 
ately. If you witness an accident or 
another type of incident, call us 
immediately. Wilh your help, we 
can continue to keep our campus 
safe. 



Policy needs to protect everyone 



By Linda Fox 

Assistant Professor of Spanish 

and Women's Studies 

Once again, Purdue University, 
West Lafayette has failed to give 
protected status and assurance of 
non-harassment to one segment of 
our campus population which, in 
the opinion of many, may be the 
one which needs such assurance 
most: gay and lesbian faculty, staff 
and students. I have read only the 
report in Sunday morning's Journal 
Gazette (Sep.18, 1994) and I have 
not seen the written policy as yet, 
but the newspapers report that 
Purdue University's new policy 
"defines harassment as conduct thai 
creates an intimidating or hostile 
environment..." and according to 
the newspaper article "targets inap- 
propriate behavior based on race, 
national origin, religion, age, sex 
and disability." 

Our civil rights and affirmative 
action laws do not as yet offer full 
"protected status" to the gay and 
lesbian segment of our society, and 
while that failure certainly needs to 
be addressed nationally, wouldn't it 
be nice if this campus could be a 
model in this regard? After all. if 
the college community, which 
should present and discuss widely 
differing ideas in an atmosphere of 
intellectual exploration and under- 



standing, does not protect and value 
a segment of its population, how 
then may we expect wider society 
to do so? 

President Bcering's statement 
indicated that "the university is 
committed to the promotion of har- 
mony among diverse people and the 
protection of individual rights." The 
statement from the president's 
office said, "We arc determined to 
assure freedonufrom harassment in 
any form, bul especially when it is 
motivated by intolerance." If this 
were truly so, Purdue West 
Lafayette would not suck strictly to 
the legally protected classes above 
and would include the segment of 
our population which needs this 
kind of assurance at least as much 
or more so than oiher groups men- 
tioned. 

Over the past few years (and I 
have been here for 23), I have 
become aware of a growing back- 
lash against gays and lesbians at 
IPFW, mostly in the form of mind- 
less comments, but occasionally 
also in acts which are very violent 
in their venom against gay and les- 
bian individuals. Usually, these are 
anonymous (those most likely to 
perpetrate these are cowards, no 
doubt, since they choose to try to 
intimidate and not to tolerate when 
they face difference). 

It is not as "acceptable" to make 



racist or sexist remarks (although 
these are still around), but anti-gay 
and anti-lesbian comments are "fair 
game" since these groups don't 
have the same protected rights as 
others. As early as iwo years ago 
the discussion by the Faculty Senate 
made ii clear that there was consid- 
erable support for inclusion of this 
group in the Student Code and in 
harassment policies. The time for 
action has come, since it is now 
perfecdy evident that Purdue West 
Lafayeite will not change its way of 
thinking on this issue. 

I personally remain devoted to 
making IPFW a place not of perse- 
cution because of diversity but 
understanding and, yes, even accep- 
tance of that diversity. In one of the 
cultural diversity workshops offered 
lasi year at IPFW, the metaphor of 
this country as a salad bowl, not a 
melting pot, was explored. We are 
all different in some way. Why 
can't we respect (if not value) dif- 
ferences of all types at IPFW? 

I challenge the new administra- 
tion at IPFW to extend Purdue's 
"new" an ti- harass men t policy to the 
group that has already been identi- 
fied by other minorities at IPFW as 
the most at risk; our gay and lesbian 
faculty, students and staff. In that 
way our commitment on this cam- 
pus to diversity of all kinds will be 
made crystal clear.

Satire 

Joe Camel Salutes 
The Marlboro Man 



By Craig Singleton 
Guest Writer 

Whul? Can this be true? Has 
there been an allegiance forged 
between decades-old enemies? Yes, 
I, Joe Camel, am confirming my 
admiration for the ever articulate 
Marlboro Man. And I am pleased to 
announce that an alliance has been 
formed between the Marlboro Man 
and myself. The purpose of this 
alliance is to do battle wilh die self- 
proclaimed pristine, sclf-righlcous, 
anti-civil liberties, fascist group of 
non-smokers who arc trying desper- 
ately to annul the rights of smokers. 
I, being very wary against making 
generalizations, would like to slate 
that the Marlboro Man and myself 
acknowledge the existence of that 
select and rationalistic group of 
non-smokers who abhor (he hellish 
and discriminative ideology and 
practices of their non-smoking 
bevy. And to them. The Man and I 
express our deepest appreciation. 

As you may have read. The Man 
put forth the proposition that rein- 
stating the "Green Room" in the 
cafeteria in Walb Union may allevi- 
ate some of the unceasing ire that 
non-smokers have towards smokers 
who, in greater numbers, are now 
congregating outside of the build- 
ings and on the walkways. By 
reestablishing the "Green Room," 
smokers would once again have a 
comfortable and out-of-the-way 
place lo indolently relish a cigarette. 
Ahh yes! I can hear the rebuttal of 
the non-smokers come spewing 
forth at (his very moment. And it is 
here thai I must brandish a warning. 
And that is, unbeknownst to a 
majority of the non-smokers. I, Joe 
Camel, though just a camel, 1 am 
quite exceptionally rigged wilh 
cogent retorts for the diatribes of 
trie non-smoking oppressors. 

Let's just start with lhat first 
rebuttal thai non-smokers will dis- 
gorge in futility. The non-smoker 
will say, "But even if they open up 
die 'Green Room," there will still be 
smokers chugging away outside the 
doors on campus. And why should I 
be forced lo inhale any of thai sec- 
ondary smoke?" Well, thai is a solid 
rcbulial. I'd give i( a five on a scale 
of one to (en. The next argument is 
one thai every non-smoker wields 
with a ferociousness lhat is unbe- 
coming: "And why should I, as a 
non-smoker, have lo pay for the 
hospital bills of the smoker with ter- 
minal lung cancer?" Thai one gets a 
three; sorry! Al this point, the non- 
smoker is engaged in a devouring 
hypocrisy thai is a presage of their 
innate fanaticism. 
Because, you see. you beaulifuly 
bronzed non-smoker trying to color 
and mold your body into ihc proper 
depiction of what an ideal and ath- 
letic American should be, you, too, 
are a target for oppression. You will 
do anything to get that perfect Ian. 
If you can'i get enough "au 
naturel," you go get your artificial 



fix. You're hungry, nay, siarving 
for those UV rays lhal will set you 
apart from ihe rcsi. Oh, what a god 
or goddess you will be! All the 
while deep within your corpse, the 
seed is nourished that will one day 
let you, too. become a medical bur- 
den on the taxpayers; if not from 
sunbathing, men from something 
else. 

Oh, but I know what you're 
thinking, if someone gels cancer 
because of sunbathing it is their 
own fault, and at least they aren't 
hurling anyone else. Well yes, but 
why should society be forced lo pay 
for someone else's foolish actions? 
You see. foolish actions arc subjec- 
tive, and The Man and I recognize 
that these are polemical issues on 
which most people harbor strong 
opinions. 

1( is not thai we deny ihc inher- 
ent risk lhat these and most of life's 
other activities involve, we simply 
wish lo know where groups, like 
non-smokers, are going to draw the 
line. The Marlboro Man's concern. 
as well as mine, goes much deeper. 
We sense ihe awakening of a beast 
that will nol stop until it has 
devoured or eliminated all of that 
which it deems inappropriate. 

Will the Marlboro Man awake 
one mom' lo find thai his motorcy- 
cle has been confiscated because 
motorcycle exhaust was found to 
cause cancer in laboratory animals? 
Will Mrs. Camel or Mrs. Marlboro 
have their right lo not have a baby 
taken away from them because it 
violates one religious group's ideol- 
ogy? My biggest fear, being a 
camel, is that one day my family 
and I will be told that we will have 
to go back to the desert because we 
look and smell different, and are a 
threat to the societal order and well 
being. 

However, no matter how dire ihe 
persecution becomes, the Marlboro 
Man has traveled down lonelier 
trails and I have crossed more 
scorching deserts. Besides, al this 
very moment, The Man and 1 are 
busy oul recruiting the likes of Will 
Winston and Karl Carlton to join us 
in ihe fight Rest assured coordinate 
smokers, the oppressors haven't 
heard the last from us! However, I 
will not be degraded to ihe abysmal 
ribaldry of sharing a spittoon with a 
non-smoker.

Diverse Giants are back 



By Jamie C'raver, 
Staff Writer 

They Might Be Giants has long 
,becn heralded as one of the best col- 
lege rock bands around. Us mem- 
bers have always contained a great 
sense of original and diverse style 
that is still present on the newly 
released album "John Henry." 

"John Henry" is the band's fifth 
CD and boasts 20 new songs. 
, The core members of They 
Might Be Giants arc John 
Flansburgh on guitars and vocals 
and John Linncl on keyboards, 
boms and vocals. On their newest 
release, Flansburgh and Linncl arc 
supported by a large cast of musi- 
cians which accounts for the musi- 
;cal diversity on the new CD. 

The first track entitled 
"Subliminal" is a quirky little tune 
about looking for the subliminal 
messages presented in life. The 
track ends fittingly with something 
sung in reverse. 

, "Subliminal" is followed by 
lanoiher track entitled "Snail Shell," 
[which is a sarcastic lashing out at 
someone — "1 want to thank you for 
putting mc kick in my snail shell." 

On "Why Must I Be Sad," the 
group pays homage to Alice 
Cooper. 

"A Self Called Nowhere" is one 



of the highlights on the CD and 
contains some very powerful music 
on the refrain. 

They Might Be Giants makes 
good use of personal remembrances 
and knowledge that it presents to 
the listener in a unique lyrical fash- 
ion that is sometimes hard to fol- 
low. 

Overall, "John Henry" is great if 
you like music that is diverse and 
upbeat, and has some pop appeal 
thrown in. The guitar used along 
with the keyboards and horns really 
creates a good mix of music 
throughout the CD. 

If you already are a They Might 
Be Giants fan, then you will defi- 
nitely not be disappointed by what 
is probably their best effort to date. 

On a different note, there have 
been some interesting rumors circu- 
lating around the alternative music 
world. First, there has been talk that 
Smashing Pumpkins will not tour 
this fall because they arc presently 
in the siudio working on a new CD. 

Also, Pearl Jam will be releasing

month spring and fall programs and 
also a three-month summer pro- 
gram. Hospitality majors will Find

'We almost won the damn thing,' Neely said 



By David Neely 

D&gt;FW Men'* and Women'* Crow 

Country C«ach 

The IPKW Men's and Women's 
cross country Ica/ns opened up Ibeir 
season* list Saturday, Sept. 10. The 
cross country race was held at the 
Pioneer Campground in Gas City 
and hosted by Indiana Weskyan 

In the women's race, Marian 
College brought home the team tro- 
phcy with a score of 40 points. 
IPFW finished second with 48 
points and Spring Arbor came in 
third with 74 points. 

I was really proud of them 
today: wc almost won the damn 
thing! I riad two freshman girls out 



front (Mckcnncdy and Roser) and 
wc had fifty five seconds between 
our top five. 

Our number one girl from last 
year (Dawn Valid finished fifth on 
the team and was not up to par 
because of fifteen bee slings she 
recicved Monday while at practice. 
If Dawn would have been up in the 
front wc would have won! 

In the mens race, IPFW didn't 
compete with a whole (cam. 

I've got some kids who -.till need 
to have their academics checked out 
by the NCAA, and 1 had one runner 
doing weekend military duly. 
Freshman Jon Wyss paced the team 
with a time of 29:47. 

A sad note this year is that Jason 



Douglas and Shannon Wcizel will 
not run this year due (o medical rea- 
sons. 



The IPFW cross country team 
'ill run next at Taylor, Sept. 17.

The IPFW women's volleyball 
team went onc-for-two last week- 
end, losing to both Northwood (11- 
15, 11-15, 9-15) and Northern 
Kentucky (7-15, 1-15. 16-14, 5-15). 
The team managed to salvage the 
weekend by oulbilling Indianapolis 
en route to a 15-7.9-15, 15-10, 15- 
13 win. 

Coach Tim llcffron said. "It was 
just a matter of time before we put 
them away." 

On Monday. Heffron pointed to 
a lack of intensity as a contributing 
factor to the team's skid over the 
weekend. 

"Overall," Heffron explained, 
"the team didn't perform as well as 
they could have." 

The coach called a private meet- 
ing before practice on Monday and 



Women destroy Depauw 

By Eric Butler 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW women's tennis team 
played two matches this past week- 
end and came nway 1-1. Coach Dan 
Brogan was pleased with the teams 
overall effort after last week's dis- 
mal performance against Indianapolis. 

After beating Depauw 9-0 in con- 
vincing style on Friday, the team 
dropped a hard-fought 3-6 decision 
to Bellarminc. a tough conference 
opponent, on Saturday. 

Roxanne Valentine and Michelle 
Wise won both of their number one 
doubles matches this weekend and 
arc playing strong, consistent tennis. 

Brogan spoke with high praise of 
Jcnni Jackson's "unbelievable" 
come from behind win (7-6) against 
Betlarmine. Jackson was down 5-2 
in the third set when she started her 
unlikely comeback. 

Another standout player this 
weekend was Carrie Claypool. 
Claypool won both of her matches 
and is playing very sound tennis. 

Brogan said the team improves a 
little bit each match they play, and 
that he expects them to be in top 
form come tournament lime. 



said he expects the team to be 
pumped up for this week's games 
against St. Joe on Friday at 7 p.m. 
and the well-coached Lewis team 
on Saturday at 3:30p.m. 

Both games will be played at the 
Hilliard Gates Sports Center here at 
IPFW. 

In the team's only win against 
Indianapolis, Heffron said he saw 
many bright spots in individual play 
that may prove useful later in the 
season: Tiffany Martin stepped up 
to the challenge on Saturday and 
put in a good effort as the outside 
bitter; the middle hitlers were also 
very effective against Indy; and, the 
duo of Mollie Dotlie and Amy 
Reidcnbach produced consistently 
on offense. 

Doltic racked up a .500 hitting 
average while Reidcnbach ended 
with an average in the high .400's.
