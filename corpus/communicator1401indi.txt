Counseling problems plague students, staff 



The first time you, a new freshman, confront a 
college professor peering at you from across a clut- 
tered, paper-strewn desk asking, "What classes do 
you want?" several options present themselves. 

The most attractive at that moment may be flight. 
To bolt out the door, panic-filled footsteps echoing 
down winding halls, off-campus, back to the waiting 
arms of family, friends, and your part-time job at 
McDonalds. 

Upon choosing this approach to higher education do 
not expect your counselor to chase you down and hold 
your hand while patiently answering your questions. 
There are too many other white-knuckled freshmen 
hovering around the office, waiting to receive instant 
wisdom and a signature on their own sweat-stained 
program card. 

For those who find the fortitude to stay, only two 
obstacles stand in the way of academic bliss — you 
and your counselor. 

Perhaps you have really tried to wade through your 
bulletin, but are not yet well enough versed in 
university speak. And, because you have not been 
around long enough to lose your awe of faculty 
members, you cannot yet command the seeming 
confidence of seniors who stroll casually, and a bit 
defiantly, into their counselors offices, shove their 
program cards past all others and demand, "Sign 
this," to which their counselors meekly comply. 

In short, you need help, not only about what classes 
to take but in what order, when, and from whom. A 
shot of confidence building is in order, as well as some 
help with words such as "prerequisite" and 
suggestions about how to deal with filled classes. 

But on the other side of the desk, life is not 
altogether pleasant. 

Most academic counselors are professors whose 
training for their Ph.d's did not include facing a 
seemingly endless line of students, each with special 
questions and circumstances, and running them 
through registration as quickly as p(ssible. Many 
professors have as much trouble reading the bulletins 



as do the students. 

This is not to state categorically that professors 
don't care about students, though certainly levels of 
enthusiasm vary greatly, but too many don't care 
enough about the basic importance of counseling and 
that first interview with the new student. 

The situa tion is no different if the student sees a peer 
counselor or staff member other than a professor.The 
name of the game is get registered fast, and hope the 
mistakes can be worked out through drop-add. 

The best solution would be for all academic coun- 
selors to be full-time professionals who do nothing but 
counsel. There also must be enough of them that a 
more reasonable counselor-to-student ratio would be 
possible. 

Each counselor could then have regular meetings 
withstudents to check their progress, and would know 
them by name instead of looking furtively at the 
student's file, then calling the student by then: street 
name. 

Until IPFW has the staff and funds to do this, which 
may not be until just before or after the Second 
Coming, we all must go along trying to make the 
absurd bearable. 

Be prepared for that first interview, it may be all 
you get until next semester. 

Ask yourself what your goals are at the moment. If 
you are sure of your course, proceed with all dispatch. 
If you wish to explore a bit, feel free to do so, better to 

Positions open 

in SG 



sample now than to get too far into a field of study and 
fmd that it isn't what you desire. 

In either case, have questions for your counselor. 
Write them down, don't trust your memory during the 
all-too-brief interview. 

If you feel you have an incompetent counselor or the 
two of you just don't get along, do not hesitate to go to 
the head of the department and change counselors. 
Nobody will get fired, professors don't lose or gain 
points on their counseling ability, but you can ex- 
tricate yourself from an unproductive relationship. 

Counselors, all counselors, must worit to keep up 
with bulletins, the progress of the students they ad- 
vise, and the problems students face. If the student 
doesn't say much, the counselor ought to forge ahead 
and ask questions. 

The attitude the counselor puts forth is also of 
primary importance. Perhaps faculty and staff should 
be formally judged on their counseling, and those who 
don' t do it well should not be required to. 

It is impossible to say that many students drop out of 
college because of poor counseUng. But problems with 
counseling may reflect other problems the student is 
having. For example, students who are undecided 
about what classes to take may also be unsure of their 
goals or direction. 

A counselor who is properly sensitive might be able 
to help these students, before complete frustration 
sets in. 

The best weapon for the student is a good sense of 
humor. In a few semesters, you will be able to join 
others in telling stories of your counseling adventures.

PAGE 2— THE STUDENTS' HANDBOOK — AUGUST 12, 1982 



Chancellor Giusti welcomes DPFW's new students 




Chancellor Joseph Giusti discusses the up- 
coming academic year with two IPFW 
students. 



The secpjid most popular freshman theme topic when I 
went to college was "Why Did i Choose Fill- in- the-B lank 
University?" ("How I Spent My Summer Vacation" was 
first.) While space doesn't permit a list of all possible 
reasons for choosing IPFW, I would like to congratulate you 
for having selected an instibjdon which has become suc- 
cessful by satisfying the needs and expectations of those it 
serves. 

To measure our success, we like to examine how we are 
growing and how our students, our alumni, and our com- 
munity respond to what we are doing. 

Our students' response is especially revealing. We notice 
the sacrifices which growing numbers of our students make 
to secure a higher education — how many of them finance 
their own college expenses, how many interrupt secure 
careers and give up leisure time for academic enrichment, 
how many fulfill personal and family goals by becoming the 
first university graduate in their family, and how many 
continue their involvement in communis affairs even after 
adding the social and academic responsibilities of 
university life. In recent years, this dedicated student body 
has allowed IPFW to increase evening course offerings, to 
begin a Weekend College, to expand the range of its 
academic programs, to upgrade its academic standards, 
and to expand its athletic and extracurricular programs. 
We are proud that so many determined students choose us. 

We see similar determination among our alumni, A great 
many of them return to IPFW to earn additional un- 
dergraduate and graduate de^ees, and many others 
continue their IPFW educations in workshops and 
professional programs on campus. Although we are a young 
instihition, we can number among our alumni a college 
president, several university faculty, and leaders in 
business, industry, and the major professions. Our alumni 



have recently pledged to raise $100,000 toward an en- 
dowmentfor the HelmkeLibrary. They, too. areasourceof 
our success and our pride. 

The respect of our communis, northeastern Indiana, is 
the third factor we weigh when evaluating how well we are 
doing. And everywhere we see its recognition that IPFW is 
a major asset^ a mature institution which responds 
positively to area needs. We have t&gt;een told by the com- 
munis leaders who began the Helmkfe Library endowment 
project with pledges of over $400,000 how valuable our 
faculty and our graduates are to area employers. We have 
heard from the community leaders who serve on in- 
stitutional and departmental advisory boards that IPFW 
listens and acts, that it offers up-to-date equipment and 
facilities, an excellent faculty, and the range of educational 
opportunities one expects to find at a major university. We 
appreciate hearing of our successes and hope to continue 
opening new avenues of support for IPFW, our students, 
and our graduates. 

Growth is another factor we look at when assessing our 
progress. Because we enjoy such broali-based support, 
growth continues at IPFW. This year, for example, we are 
able to increase degree-program offerings in business, 
supervision, engineering, and consumer and family 
sciences, and to improve our programs in many other 
areas. We are also able to provide state-of-the-art com- 
puter and computer-aided-design facilities for student use, 
improved academic advising, and participation in NCAA 
Division II athletics. 

"Why Did I Choose IPFW?" has over 10,000 correct an- 
swers, one for each IPFW student. No matter why you 
made your decision, we are pleased to welcome you as a 
student. We will do our best to continue our success by 
meeting your highest expectations. 



ATTENDING CLASSES 

1. Is regular class attendance required? 

Yes. Although the method of recording attendance may 
vary from class to class, students are expected to attend 
every class meeting for which they are enrolled. 

2. What should I do if I am unable to attend a class? 
Contact the professor as soon as possible to make 

arrangements for make-up work, if such work is permitted. 
The only acceptable excuses for absence are generally 
related to illness and family emergency situations. Missing 
classes may seriously reduce the quality of your work and 
result in a poor grade. 

SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENT 

3. Can I drop classes any time I want to? 

No. A class cannot be dropped during the last four weeks 
of the semester or the last two weeks of a summer session. 

4. How do I drop a class? 

First you must get a drop-add form from your advisor. 
During the first 10 weeks of classes, that is all you must 
submit to the registrar's office to officially drop the class. 
During the 11th and 12th weeks, the instructor and your 
academic dean must also approve each class to be dropped, 
and they will do so only in unusual circumstances. 

5. Can 1 add a class to my schedule after I have 
registered? 

Yes. Classes may be added with approval from your ad- 
visor during the first week of classes. The instructor of each 
class must approve additions after that time. 

6. If I want to quit school before classes are over, what do 
I have to do? 

Follow the procedure described for dropping a class. Not 
attending class is not the same as withdrawal. Students who 
do not withdraw properly from a course will receive a 
failing grade. 

CHANGING MAJORS 

7. Can I change my major if I change my mind about what 
I want to study? 

Yes, However you should contact the department that 
offers your new major. A change form will be sent to your 
department and to the registrar's office. 
GRADES 

8. What kind of grades are given credit courses? 
A full list of grades appears in the IPFW Bulletin. 

CLASSES AND GRADES: 
QUESTIONS AND answers" " """ 

9. What is the "Pass-Fail Option" for a grade in class? 
This is an opportunity for you to take some courses 

without affecting your GPA. However, unsatisfactory work 
may count as an F in your GPA. You must have an ad- 
visor's permission to take a course under this option. 

10. What does it mean if I get a grade of "I", incomplete? 
The grade of "I" means that you could not complete all 

requirements for the course by the end of the semester and 
that you and the instructor have agreed on a method to 
finish those requirements. You must remember that if the 



Ckisses And Grades 

requirements are not met by the appropriate deadline, that 
incomplete "I" gradewillbecomean"F" failing grade. 

11. If my grades are bad, will I be able to continue in 
school? 

First, all grades that you have earned at this campus will 
he averaged together. Generally, the first semester that 
this average is below the university's or school's minimum 
requirement you will only be placed on probation, which 
means that you will be given an opportunity to raise your 
GPA through additional classes the next time you enroll. If 
you then continue with poor grades, you will be subject to 
dismissal from the university. 

12. If I am dismissed from the university, will I ever be 
permitted to return? 

Generally a student may request to be readmitted to the 
university after being out of school for one semester. Once 
the readmtssion is approved, the student will be able to 
enroll but will again be placed on probation until the 
minimum GPA has been achieved. The request for read- 
mission must generally be submitted one month before the 
start of that semester. 

OTHER ACADEMIC 
MATTERS 

13. Under what conditions am I considered to be a student 
in good standing? 

You are considered to be in good standing if not 
dismissed, suspended, dropped from the university without 
being readmitted, or on probation. 

14. What conditions will deny me the opportunity to 
register for classes? 

The most common reason is that you owe money to the 
university. If you are a student in good standing, other 
reasons would include misconduct and violation of any 
rules adopted and made public by the trustees. 

15. If I feel that I have not been treated fairly with regard 
to a grade I received or an assignment I completed, what 
can I do about it? 

You have the right to request that the situation be 
reviewed in a process called a grade appeal. For in- 
formation regarding such procedures, contact the chair of 
the department responsible for teaching the course. 

16. Can I transfer from the Fort Wayne campus to another 
school? 

Yes. However, any student who intends to transfer should 
consult with her or his advisor to make proper 
arrangements well in advance of the intended time of 
transfer. 

CLASSES AND GRADES 

17. What is plagiarism? 

Plagiarism is claiming the work of someone else as if it 
were your own original work. Plagiarism usually occurs, 
when a student writes a paper, submits a project, or 
prepares a collection and includes quotes or ideas from 
another source without acknowledgement. It is serious 
violation and can lead to ilisciplinary action.

Activities, activities, activities 

Benefit from an extra-curricular experience! 



During the ■81-'82 school year there were 46 recognized 
student organizations on campus: Greeks, special-interest, 
departmental, religious, etc. 

The Student Union Board of Governors, SUBOG, the 
cultural and entertainment branch of students' govern- 
ment, plans activities throughout the year from which 
activity card holders may benefit. There are weekly 
movies, monthly off-campus dances, lectures, major 
concerts, ski trips, plant and candle sales, visiting artists, 
and many other interesting events. 

The activity card, which is issued to students carrying 
nine credit hours or more is required for free adniission to 
most SUBOG events. (All activities are open to the public 
with charge) It also admits you to all P.I.T. productions at a 
discount. 

The Student Senate is the legislative branch representing 
the student body. Students having problems, complaints, or 
suggestions should inform one of the eighteen student 
senators. The Senate offers programs such as book sales, 
ID pictures, and free legal advice. Meeting once a week 
throughout the academic year, it legislates on the use of 



activity fee funds, rules and r^ulations, and campus 
committee appointments. Students interested in becoming 
involved in students' government or in serving on one of its 
committees should contact the office in Walb Memorial 
Union 225. 

Other facilities in the Union include podcet billiards, 
music-listening room, lounge areas with piano, pinball, 
ping-pong, arts and crafts area, and darkroom. 

The Communicator is published every Thursday during 
the fall and spring semesters. The office is located in the 
Walb Memorial Union. The "Communicator" staff is 
always looking for writers, typists, ad salespeople, etc. 

Student memt)ers serve on many important campus 
committees, including those listed below. The dean of 
student services in Walb Memorial Union 118 can provide 
further information. 

Athletic Advisory Committee — This committee ap- 
proves budgets, schedules intercollegiate sports, defines 
eligibility policies, and acts as advisor to the chancellor on 
athletics. 

Chancellor's Student Advisory Committee — The 



members of this committee lunch with the chancellor once 
a month to keep him informed of student views and needs. 

Traffic Appeals Board — This board hears traffic ticket 
appeals. 

Advisory Committee for Handicapped Persons — Hiis 
committee studies the needs and concerns of disabled 
students and staff, and makes recommendations to the 
chancellor for improvements or modifications. 

Traffic and Parking Advisory Board — This committee

penalties. 

Day Care Center Committee — This committee, which 
meets informally once a month, is concerned with 
operational matters of the Day Care Center. The dean of 
student services, one student, and parents of day care 
children serve on the committee.

committee consists of three students, two facul^, the dean 
of student services, and an official of the newspaper. Its 
purpose is to oversee management, appoint editors, and 
approve budgets and major contracts.

Grade Appeak Procedures 



A faculty body is currently studying a uniform grade 
appeal policy for the IPFW campus. Until this document 
has been approved, the following procedure should be 
followed by a student who has evidence or believes that 
evidence exists to show that an inappropriate grade has 
been assigned as a result of prejudice, caprice, or other 
improper conditions such as mechanical error or assign- 
ment of a grade inconsistent with those assigned other 
students. Additionally, a student may challenge the 
reduction of a grade for alleged scholastic dishonesty. 
Further details on grade appeals appear in this "Hand- 
book's" discussion of the Indiana University and Purdue 
University Student Conduct Codes. Those statements take 
precedence over statements below. 

In appealing a grade the burden of proof is on the 
student, except in the case of the alleged academic 
dishonesty, where the instructor must support the 
allegation. 

Informal attempts must be made to resolve grade 
grievances and appeals at the lowest level. If the grievance 
in question cannot be resolved durmg a conference with 
your instructor, you should speak to the department chair. 

Further appeals will be heard by departmental com- 
mittees or by department chairs. 

Cases not resolved at this level should be referred to the 
school-divisional dean or coordinator. Informal school- 
divisional boards or committees may be established to 
assist deans and coordinators in mediating student 
grievances. Unresolved appeals from this level should be 
directed to the vice chancellor and dean of the faculty, who 
may make a final written decision on all academic grade 
appeals after ascertaining that all previous means of ap- 
peal have been duly pursued by all parties involved. 

Housing Information 

No housing facihties are on the IPFW Campus. However, 
the student activities office (482-S616) dispenses housing 
information upon request. There are dormitory facilities 
available for men and women at nearby Concordia 
Theological Seminary, and dormitory-type facilities 
available for women only at the YWCA. The student ac- 
tivities office does not approve or disapprove housing; it 
merely serves as a clearinghouse for housing information. 



Veterans^ Services 

Your GI Bill education benefits can be used at IPFW. The 
veterans services office in Kettler 107 will help you apply 
for aid. Usually, the only form you should bring is your 
discharge paper (DD214) 

Normal processing time for a new application is 45-60 
days. 

The Vet-Rep-On-Carapus has information dealing with 
all-phases of veterans' benefits, or can refer you to the 
proper community . 



Transitional Studies 

On the way to a degree, you may need some help. 
Transitional Studies can make the critical. difference. 

The Developmental Skills Center (Kettler 118) offers you 
free help in developing reading, writing, math and study 
skills (note-taking, textbook-reading, test-taking) on a 
drop-in basis, day and evening, during the school year. 

You can find in the Developmental Skills Center free 
tutorial help in some introductory-Goitfses.We also attempt 
to match people needing tutorial help in advanced courses 
with available tutors; financial arrangements for this 
tutoring must be made by students and tutors involved. 

Credit course work is offered in individualized sections of 
English W130 (Principles of Composition) ; Education X150 
(Reading-Learning Techniques 1), a reading-study skills 
course; Education X151 (Reading -Learning Techniques 
11), a study skills course which emphasizes the application 
of study skills to real college courses; and selected sections 
of Math 111, which maintain a smaller than-average 
student-teacher ratio. 

The RAP {Returning Adult Place) Program is for 
student coming to the university after being out of school 
for one or more years. RAP features a free monthly 
newsletter on university services and procedures, and a 
monthly meeting dedicated to improving students' study or 
personal skills. To get the newsletter and meeting in- 
formation; stop in Kettler 118, or call us at 482-5586. 



Financial Aid 



Financial aid helps students finance their college 
education. The financial aid office (4B2-5641) uses grants 
and scholarships, loans, and part-time employment, either 
^■"g'y or in combination, as the means to provide this 
assistance. 

Even thou^i most aid is restricted to full-time un- 
dergraduate students, some programs are available for 
part-time and graduate students. You must file an IPFW 
financial aid appHcation and a Financial Aid Form (FAF) 
to be considered. The applications are reviewed con- 
fidentially by a financial aid counielor, and your aid award 
is based on the calculated need and the availability of funds. 

You are urged to apply by March 1 for the following 
academic year. AppUcations are accepted after that date 
but late filers run the risk of encountering fund shortages. 
Also, early application assures that your forms will be 
processed in time for fall registration. 

The financial aid office located in Kettler 109, has a staff 
of trained counselors to assist with the application process. 
The regular office hours are 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday, and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday. If 
necessary, appointments may be made at other times.

National Student Exchange 



An exciting opportunity awaits students through the 
National Student Exchange Program. Have you ever 
dreamed of going to school in Montana, New Mexico, South 
CaroUna. Wisconsin, or perhaps even Hawaii, and not be 
charged out-of-state fees? Your dream could come true by 
participating in the National Student Exchange Program. 

The NSE program provides the opportunity for IPFW 
students to spend a year of study in residence at a member, 
institution during their sophomore or junior years. 
Participating students remain enrolled at IPFW while on 
exchange, and credit earned on exchange is recorded as 
regular degree credit. It is an ideal way for students to 
broaden cultural and educational horizons while 
progressing toward their local degree objectives. 

If the National Student Exchange Program sounds ex- 
citing and interesting to you, stop by Kettler iiOE and ask 
for more details.

Greeks 



College is a whirlwind of activity. In its 
boundaries lie opportunities leading to the 
new and unknown, opportunities to help you 
grow and discover yourself and your 
potential. 

A college education is not just a four-year 
classroom experience, but also a time of 
personal growth and development. You'll 
meet all types of people and become exposed 
to all ^pes of lifestyles. You may find much 
you once believed in to be challenged, and 
those things you once took for granted may no 
longer be so easily enjoyed. 

In the middle of Uiis new-found activity, you 
may find yourself lost, with no place to turn 
for help. 

As a result, you may find it desirable to 
seek within the university a smaller com- 
munity with which to share. A sorority or 
fraternity provides just this — a smaller 
community, a base from which you can 
become involved and grow. 

Within the Greek system, a special kind of 
growth takes place, one that is rarely found in 
any other campus activity. You learn about 
yourself through interactions and close 
friendships in your sorority or fraternity and 
among other Greeks, and can use these ex- 
periences as a foundation for participation in 
the many other facets of university life. 

In no other campus group does a com- 
munity exist for the sole purpose of enhancing 
individuality. 

Through the Greek system, you are given a 
better chance to become involved, to grow, 
and to develop lasting friendships. 

SCHOLARSHIP is what college is all about. 



Greek organizations encourage members to 
grow intellectually and to achieve academic 
excellence, with the aid of scholarship 
committees and sbjdy buddies. 

LEADERSHIP experiences offered by the 
Greek system at IPFW range from chapter 
and Panhellenic Council offices to com- 
mittees and student government. En- 
couragement to get involved with activities is 
supplied by many of the Greek organizations 
to their members. 

ACTIVITIES for Greeks at IPFW include a 
variety of social events which give many fun- 
fiUed memories as well as the experience of 
being part of your school's activities. The 
events range from formal to informal dances, 
fraternity socials, Greek week, and the an- 
nual Harbor Arbor Day Festival and Three 
Rivers Festival. 

The list of social events and the op- 
portunities to meet new friends and develop 
social awareness and skills are substantial. 

PHILANTHROPICSare an important part 
of Greek life. Each organization has a 
national philanthropy which it supports. 
Members are asked to donate theu* time for 
service and to help raise money for their 
charity. A successful philanthropic endeavor 
takes dedication, patience and time, but 
rewards every member of the chapter. 

There are two sororities — Pi Beta Phi and 
Delta Gamma, and three fraternities — 
Sigma Phi Epsilon, Phi Kappa Theta, and 
Delta Sigma Pi. 

Rush information will be available at the 
Student Services office in the Walb Memorial 
Union after August 23.

A Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities 

(Indiana University) 



SECTION I. STUDENT RIGHTS 
AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

1.1 Students should have accurate and plainly stated 
information relating to the maintenance of acceptable 
academic standing, graduation requirements, and in- 
dividualcourseobjectivesand requirements (see thelPFW 
Bulletin). 

1 .2 Student records will be maintained in keeping with the 
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, further 
amendmenU and the HEW guidelines for implementation. 

1.3 In all academic evaluations, and in instances of 
academic discipline, the student has the right to fair and 
impartial treatment. 

1.4 

(a) Students may establish, issue, and distribute — 
consistent with appropriate regulations concerning the 
time, place, and manner of distribution — student-directed 
publications which are in no way published under the 
auspices of the university and are published without any 
financial support from the university. Such regulations 
shall not be designed to restrict student access to these 
publications on university property. 

(b) Student-directed publications which are published 
under university auspices shall be free of censorship. The 
universi^ shall honor this freedom by publicly recognizing 
and protecting the student editors' and managers' right to 
establish editorial policies — within the bounds of 
[K-evailing legal standards and standards of journalism. 
Specifically, student editors or managers may not be 
suspended or removed in response to pressure by external 
groups disagreeing with their editorial policies. 

1.5 Students have the right to freedom from unlawful 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or 
national origin. 

1.6 Students shall have the opportunity to participate in 
the formulation of policy directly affecting students 
through membership on appropriate committees as 
determined by the chancellor and the president of the 
university. 

1.7 Students should be free from illegal searches and 
seizures. 

1.8 

(a) The university will not interfere with the rights of 
students to join associations which promote their common 
interests as students. 

(b) Student organizations holding a fiscal-l^al 
relationship with the university are subject to university 
policies, procedures, and regulations pertaining to such 
organizations. 

1.9 

(a) Indiana University considers freedom of inquiry and 
discussion essential to a student's educational develop- 
ment. Thus, the university recognizes the right of all 
students to engage in discussion, to exchange thought and 
opinion, and to speak, write, or print freely on any subject, 
in accordance with the guarantees of federal and state 
constitutions. This broad principle is a cornerstone of 
education in a democracy. 

(b) For their programs student groups on the campus 
may freely select persons they wish to invite as guest 
speakers or performers. There are no restrictions on the 
point of view expressed by speakers other than those im- 
posed by national or state law. The invitation to an outside 
speaker does not imply approval or sponsorship of the 
speaker's views by the university nor by the group inviting 
the speaker. 

(c) University facilities are designed to accommodate the 
scheduled activities of the university, to accommodate the 
extracurricular activities of student groups, and to ac- 
commodate visitors and guests of the university. From 
time to time, as extraordinary requests may justify, 
facilities may be made available for programs of various 
kinds sponsored by non-university groups, especially for 
charitable or civic purposes. 

(d) The university does not make its facilities available 
for fund-raising purposes if the funds are designated to 
enrich an individual or commercial sponsor. 

(e) The university's facilities ordinarily will he 
unavailable for the purpose of providing entertainment of a 
kind that is available in the outside community and is 
competitive with it. 

(f) The university reserves the right to ccHitrol its 
facilities to assure that events held are compatible with its 
prime purpose of serving the university community by 
making available to it programs that appear to enhance its 
cultural and educational opportunities. 

(g) The university will at all times seek to assure student 
and faculty groups the opportunity to meet and to hear and 
exchange ideas and views, however controversial, but it 
does not license and will not tolerate what is illegal. 

1.10 Students are free to engage in peaceful and orderly 
protest, demonstration, and picketing which does not 
disrupt functions of the university. 

1.11 Students have the right to freely exercise their full 



rights as citizens. In this light, the university affirms the 
right to students to exercise their freedoms without 
university interference or fear of university sanction for 
such activity. 

1.12 As members of the academic community, students 
have an obligation to that community and to the preser- 
vation of the academic process. As citizens, students have 
the responsibility to know and obey the laws of the United 
States, the State of Indiana, and of local governments. 
Student status in no way exempts them from the 
requirements of obeying such laws. 

1.13 

(a) The following actions constitute misconduct for which 
students may be penalized, by such sanctions as described 
in 1.13 (c), when committed on university property: 

(1) Actions which endanger the student, the university 
community, or the academic process. 

(2) Conduct that is made a crime by the criminal law of 
the State of Indiana or the United States of America, that 
takes place on university property or in the course of a 
university activity. 

(3) Academic dishonesty, such as cheating and 
plagiarism; knowingly furnishing false information; and 
forgery, alteration, or unauthorized use of university 
documents, records, identification, or property. 

(4) Intentional actions which obstruct, disrupt, or 
physically interfere with the use of university premises, 
buildings, rooms, or passages, or refusal to vacate a 
building, street, sidewalk, driveway, or other facility of the 
university when directed to do so by an authorized officer of 
the university having just cause to order the vacation. 

(5) Use of, or threatened use of physical force or 
violence to restrict the freedom of any person, or acting 
with violence, or aiding, abetting, encouraging, or par- 
ticipating in a riot or rioting, or inciting a riot, when the 
conduct occurs on university property or in the course of a 
university activity. 

(6) Initiation or circulation of a report or warning of an 
impending bombing, false alarm of fire, or other crime, 
emergency, or catastrophe, knowing that the report is 
false; or knowingly transmitting such a report to an official 
or to an official agency, or intentionally false reporting of a 
fire, or that a bomb or other explosive has been placed in 
any university building or elsewhere on university 
property. 

(7) Failure to comply with the directions of university 
officials and their authorized agents acting in the per- 
formance of their duties. 

(8) Possession or use of alcoholic beverages on any 
university property contrary to law; the possession or use 
of alcoholic beverages in any undergraduate residence 
supervised by the university; or the use or conspicuous 
possession of alcoholic beverages in or on any property of 
the university frequented by the public. 

(9) Possession of firearms or other dangerous weapons on 
university property contrary to law; possession or display 
of any firearm on university property frequented by the 
public, except in the course of an authorized activity; or 
possession of weapons in residence halls on university 
property in violation of residence halls rules. 

(10) Intentional possession on university property of a 
dangerous article or substance as a potential weapon, or of 
any article or substance calculated to injure or discomfort 
any person without consent. 

(11) Possession or use of illegal fireworks, incendiary 
devices, or other dangerous explosives. 

(12) Possession or use of illegal drugs. 

(13) Intentional damage to or destruction of university 
property or of property on university premises belonging to 
others. 

(b) Actions not committed on university property may 
also be subject to penalties, provided Uiat the offense 
relates to the security of the university community or the 
integrity of the educational process (e.g., rape, arson, fraud 
...). 

(c) The scope of disciplinary sanctions which may be 
imposed on students is as follows: r^rimand; disciplinary 
[vobation; expulsion from university housing; suspension 
or expulsion from the university. In addition, academic 
misconduct may be punished by an academic sanction in 
the course in which the misconduct occurred. 

(d) The process for imposing academic and-or 
disciplinary sanctions shall be designed to accord students 
the guarantees of due process and procedural fairness. 

(c) The university undertakes to ensure equal treatment 
of students subject to disciplinary or academic sanctions, 
and to impose similar sanctions for similar misconduct; 
provided, that the student's prior conduct record, if any, 
will be taken into consideration. 

SECTION n. DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES 

2.1 Applicability of Procedures 

A student charged with violating university rules of 
student conduct shall be punished only in accordance with 
the following procedures. H^wiver, house and hall rules, 



motor vehicle regulations, and procedures under which 
those regulations are enforced, as well as procedure under 
which the university applies its checklist to collect monies, 
continue in force, and adjudication of questions rising under 
them need not comply with the following procedures and do 
not apply to controversies that are amenable to those 
procedures. 
2.2 Notice 

(a) Disciplinary action against a studentshallbe initiated 
by the dean of student services by the sending of a notice to 
the student. 

(b) The notice shall be sent by certified mail to the 
student's address as it appears in the official records of the 
university or shall be delivered personally to the student. 
The notice shall quote the rule claimed to have been 
violated and shall fairly inform the student of the reported 
circumstances of the allegedly wrongful conduct. The 
notice shall require the student to appear in the office of the 
dean at a time and on a date specified (which ordinarily will 
not be earlier than seven days after the mailing of the 
notice) to discuss the alleged violation. 

(c) The notice shall inform the student of the following: 

(1) The offense the student is alleged to have committed 
by citing the relevant section of this code; 

(2) The date, time, and place of allied commission, and 
other relevant circumstances; 

(3) The date, time, and place of the conference to discuss 
the alleged violation; 

(4) That the student may have an advisor or other counsel 
at the conference; 

(5) That the student need not answer questions and that a 
choice to remain silent will not be taken as an admission of 
guilt; 

(6) That, if the student fails to appear for Uie conference, 
the dean may: (a) reschedule the conference; (b) dismiss 
the charges; or (c) if the dean reasonably believes the 
failure to be inexcusable, impose any of the disciplinary 
penalties described under Section I, paragraph 1.13 (c). 

(7) That many disciplinary penalties imposed under the 
circumstances noted in paragraph (6) above shall be 
subject to further hearing or appeal, but the fact of the 
student's failure to appear at the conference, if unjustified, 
may be weighed as a factor in future hearings. 

2.3 Student's Response to Charge: Disposition Without 
Hearing 

(a) When the student appears as required, the dean shall 
inform the student as fully as possible of the facts alleged. 
The student may, but need not, make responses and ex- 
planations. 

(b) If, after discussion and such further investigation as 
may be necessary, the dean determines that the violation 
alleged is not supported by the evidence, the dean shall 
dismiss the accusation and notify the student. 

(c) If, after discussion, or if the student fails to appear, 
and if the dean is satisfied that the violation occurred as 
alleged, the dean shall so notify the student and shall 
propose a penalty by means of a written notice. The 
shident, by such notice, shall be offered Uie choice either of 
consenting to the determination and proposed penalty or of 
requesting a hearing before a hearing commission. Should 
a student desire a hearing before a hearing commission, the 
request shall be made in writing and delivered to the dean 
on or before a date specified in Uie notice that proposes the 
penalty, which shall be a date no earlier Uian seven days 
after its mailing. 

(d) If no written choice is received by the dean within the 
time specified, no hearing shall be held, the punishment 
proposed by the dean shall be imposed, and the action shall 
be considered final. 

2.4 Hearing 

(a) If a student requests a hearing, the dean shall make 
arrangements for the hearing ; but thereafter, with notice to 
Uie shident, the dean may request Uie hearing commission 
(see 2.4 (b)) to dismiss the case. If a hearing is to take 
place, notice from the dean shaU he sent by certified mail to 
Uie student's address as it Uien appears in Uie official 
records of the university or shall be delivered personally 
to the student. The notice shall inform the student of the

student indicates in writing to the dean, at least five days in 
advance of the hearing, a desire to open the hearing to the 
public. The dean and the presiding oTficer of the hearing 
commission shall make arrangements satisfactory to the 
hearing commission to accommodate observers if a 
hearing is to be public, and the hearing commission's 
choice of place and determination of the number of ob- 
servers that can be conveniently accommodated is final; 

(9} that the failure to appear at the hearing will be action 
for which the hearing commission could impose any 
disciplinary sanction without right of further appeal if the 
hearing commission, upon diligent inquiry, finds such 
failure to be inexcusable. 

(b) A hearing shall be conducted before a hearing 
commission, appointed by the chancellor, which shall 
consist of three members: one student and two faculty 
members, one of the faculty to serve also as the presiding 
officer of the commission. Each hearing commfssion shall 
be constituted from a list of:

president upon recommendation of the student assembly or 
other appropriate representative body. 

(2) ten or more faculty members (to be representative of 
the various academic disciplines) to be appointed by the 
chancellor. 

(c) If any vacancy on the hearing list occurs because of 
the failure or refusal of the appropriate authorities to make 
recommendations to fill vacancies, the chancellor may 
make appointments, fill vacancies, or take such other 
action as is necessary to constitute the hearing list or any 
hearing commission. The memtiers of the hearing com-

tinuance of the hearing. The hearing commission shall 
provide a taped transcript of all proceedings, which 
transcript shall be maintained for a period of one year. 

( f ) Copies of all communications pertaining to the allied 
offense from the dean of student services to a student whose 
case is pending shall be sent to the presiding officer. The 
dean of student services bringing charges and the student, 
or the student's advisor or other counsel, may present and 
examine witnesses, present other evidence, and may cross- 
examine witnesses. The student charged with an offense 
may testify, but shall not be ordered to testify by the 
hearing commission, nor shall failure to testify be con- 
sidered an admission of guilt. The burden of proving that 
the student has committed the offense or offenses as 
charged shall be upon the university. 

( g) The decision of the hearing commission shall be solely 
based upon matters introduced at the hearing and must be 
based upon substantial and convincing evidence. A decision

based on the record to the review board, or that the 
respective advisor or other counsel may do so; 

(4) that the appeal hearing will be closed to the public, 
unless otherwise requested by the student at least five days 
t)efore the hearing;

(d) The members of the review board shall hold office 
from the first day of the fall semester for a term of one 
year, but they shall complete the review of any case which 
they have begun to consider. No memt)er may serve more

board occurs because of the failure or refusal of ap- 
propriate authorities to make recommendations to fill 
vacancies, the chancellor may make appointments to fill 
vacancies, or take such other action necessary to constitute 
the review board. 

(e) No hearing shall be held unless all members of the 
review board are present. If any member of the review 
tward is unable to serve or should excuse himself-herself 
from serving, another review board member shall be ap-

and (d) above. 

(f) The presiding officer of the review board, in con- 
sultation with other members, shall maintain necessary

must render a decision within twenty days of the hearing 
and may:

2.6 Failure to Appear 

If a student notified to appear before the dean or before a 
hearing commission fails to comply and if the dean or the 
hearing commission reasonably believes that the violation 
occurred as alleged, the dean or the hearing commission 
shall so notify the student and shall propose an appropriate 
sanction by means of written notice. When an extension of 
time appears necessary to avoid undue hardship or in- 
justice, Uie dean may extend the time to enable a student to 
respond to an accusation or prepare a defense. 

2.7 Summary Action 

Sumniary suspension of a student and exclusion from 
university property may be imposed without the hearing 
procedure provided for in this Section, but only by the 
president of the university upon the recommendation of the 
chancellor. The president shall first be satisfied that the 
continued status as a student upon the campus seriously 
threatens harm to the student or to any other person or the 
property of the university or of others. A student so 
suspended may be required to leave the property of the 
university and may be notified that he-she will thereafter be 
treated as a trespasser if he-she returns. A student notified 
of such a suspension may, within ten days after receipt of 
such notice, request a hearing before a hearing com- 
mission, as provided in this Section, to determine whether 
the summary suspension is justified or whether the person 
should be reinstated. 

2.8 Whenever disciplinary action is initiated by the dean 
against a student under the age of eighteen, the dean shall 
make reasonable efforts to assure that the parent(s) or, 
where applicable, other legal guardian of the student is 
notified that the action is pending. 

SECTION ill. ACADEMIC DUE PROCESS 

Preamble 

Faculty and students alike have rights and respon- 
sibilities for learmng, teaching, and scholarship within the 
entire university community. Academic functions are 
characterized by reasoned discourse, intellectual honesty, 
mutual respect, and openness to constructive change. In- 
dividuals must remain active in avoiding violations (tf 
academic ethics. 

3.1 Definitions of Academic Misconduct; Student 
Misconduct 

(a) Cheating — Dishonesty of any kind with respect to 
examinations, course assignments, alteration of records, or 
illegal possession of examinations shall be considered 
cheating. 
''I^lstberespoiisi6fUty'tftfl^fatd(k&gt;ift&lt;ildt*6Aty'to«l^ttiliI^««&lt; 



trom cheating but, in addition, to guard against making it 
possible for others to cheat. Any student who helps another 
student to cheat is as guilty of cheating as the student he or 
she assists. The student should also do everything possible 
to induce respect for the examining process and for honesty 
in the performance of assigned tasks in or out of class. 

(b) Plagiarism — Honesty requires that any ideas or 
materials taken from another source for either written or 
oral use must be fully acknowledged. Offering the work of 
someone else as one's own is plagiarism. The language or 
ideas thus taken from another may range from isolated 
formulas, sentences, or paragraphs to entire articles copied 
from books, periodicals, speeches, or the writings of other 
students. The offering of materials assembled or collected 
by others in the form of projects or collections without 
acknowledgment also is considered plagiarism. Any 
student who fails to give credit for ideas or materials that 
he-she takes from another source is guil^ of plagiarism. 

3.2 Faculty Responsibilities 

The faculty and the trustees of Indiana University have 
affirmed specific responsibilities of academic appointees. 
These responsibilities are contained in the Code of 
Academic Ethics which is included in the Indiana 
University Academic Handbook. Tbe Code of Academic 
Ethics also provides procedures for enforcement of these 
responsibilities. These responsibilities include, among 
others: 

(1) A teacher will maintain a clear connection between 
the advance description £ind the conduct and content of 
each course presented to ensure efficient subject selection 
by students. 

(2) A teacher will clearly state the course goals and will 
inform students of testing and grading systems; moreover, 
these systems should be intellectually justifiable and 
consistent with the rules and regulations of the academic 
division. 

(3) A teacher Will plan and r^ulate class time with an 
awareness of its value for every student and will meet 
classes regularly. 

(4) A teacher will remain available to students and will 
announce and keep liberal office hours at hours convenient 
to students. 

(5) A teacher will strive to develop among students 
respect for others and their opinions by demonstrating his 
or her own respect for each student as an individual. 

(6) A teacher will strive to generate a proper respect for 
an understancUng of academic freedom by students. At the 
same time a teacher will emphasize high standards and 
strive to protect students from irrelevant and trivial in- 
terruptions or diversions. 

(7) Since letters of evaluation written by a teacher may 
be uniquely important documents in both the academic and 
post-university life of a student, each teacher will strive to 
make such letters both candid and fair. 

3.3 Due Process for Academic Misconduct 

(a) Student Misconduct 

(1) A faculty member who has evidence that a student is 
guil^ of cheating or plagiarism shall initiate the process of 
determining the student's guilt or innocence. 

(2) No penalty shall be imposed imtU the student has been 
informed of the charge and of the evidence upon which it is 
based and has been given an opportunity to present his 
defense. 

(3) It the faculty member finds the student guilty, he-she 
will assess a penalty within the class and shall promptly 
report the case in writing to the department chair and the 
academic head of the school or division. The penalty shall 
be in accordance with 3.4, the Actions section of Academic 
Due Process. 

(4) If the faculty member and the student cannot agree on 
the facts pertaining to the charge, or if a student wishes to 
appeal a penalty, the issue may be taken to the department 
chair. Each party will present his-her case to the chair who 
shall then call a meeting of all involved parties. If the issue 
is not resolved in the meeting with the chair, then either 
party may appeal the decision to the academic head of the 
school or division and the decision of the academic head to 
the dean of the faculty who shall convene an ad-hoc all- 
campus joint faculty and student academic review board 
from the appropriate academic disciplines, consisting of 
three facul^ members appointed by the faculty Senate and 
two students appointed by the student body prraident. 

(b) If a student lielieves that a faculty memiaer has 
violated the Code of Academic Ethics, the student may 
initiate a complaint in accordance with the "Enforcement 
Procedures" specified in the Code of Academic Ethics. 
Such complaints should be brought to the attention of an 
appropriate chair or dean, or to the dean of the faculty or a 
deputy; the dean of the faculty shall provide for con- 
fidential representations regarding such violations. 

3.4 Actions 

(a) A penalty affecting a student's grade in a course may 
be imposed by the faculty member in whose course the 
offense occurred. The faculty member is responsible for 
making proper notification to the department chair con- 
cerned and to the academic head of the school or division, 
who shall report tbe action taken to the dean of student 
services for inclusion in a confidential file designed to

provide a record that will develop information concerning 
students who have repeated offenses. For cases of repeated 
violation, the dean, alter appropriate review with the dean 
of the faculty, may initiate disciplinary action. 

(b) In cases of student academic misconduct, the 
following actions are recommended: 

(1) A student's grade in a course will be lowered when the 
student is found guilty of dishonesty on any assignment, 
examination, or paper. 

(2) An incomplete may be given in the course in the event 



any case cannot be resolved before final grades are due in 
the registrar's office. 

(3) Upon approval by the academic head of the school or 
division, the student may be transferred from tbe section in 
which the student is enrolled to another section of the same 
course. 

(4) Cases involving violations of academic ethics outside 
of a class, such as the selling of term papers, must be 
referred to the dean of student services. 

(5) In cases where disciplinary violations under Section I, 



paragraph 13 (a), have occurred simuItaneoiBly with 
violations of academic conduct, the Section I offense will be 
heard according to the procedures in Section II, 
Disciplinary Procedures. 

(6) By a two-thirds vote, the all-campus review board 
(see 3.3 (a) (4) ) may recommend to the chancellor that the 
student be disenrolled from the academic or prrfessiooal 
school in which the student is enrolled.

1. General. Students are expected and required to abide 
by the laws of the State of Indiana and of the United States 
and the rules and regulations of Purdue University, to 
conduct themselves in accordance with accepted standards 
of social behavior, to respect the rights of others, and to 
refrain from any conduct which tends to obstruct the work 
of the university or to be injurious to the welfare of the 
university. A student who violates these general standards 
of conduct may be subject to administrative actions (as 
defined in Section A-5). If the violation falls within one of 
the categories of misconduct listed in Section B-2, the 
student may also be subject to disciplinary penalties (as 
defined in Section A-5). No disciplinary penalty may be 
imposed except for misconduct covered by one of the 
categories listed in Section B-2. 

2. Misconduct Subject to Discipliaary Penalties. The 
following actions constitute misconduct for which students 
may be subject to administrative action or disciplinary 
penalties, a. Dishonesty in connection with any University 
activity. Cheating, plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing 
false information to the university are examples of 
dishonesty. 

The commitment of the acts of cheating, lying, steaUng, 
and deceit in any of their diverse forms (such as the use of 
ghost-written papers, the use of substitutes for taking 
examinations, tbe use of iUegal cribs, plagiarism, and 
copying during examinations) is dishonest and must not be 
tolerated. Moreover, knowingly to aid and abet, directly or 
indirectly, other parties in committing dishonest acts is in 
itself dishonest. 

b. Forgery, alteration, or the unauthorized use of 
university documents, records or identification. 

c. Obstruction of disruption of any university activity (as 
defined in Section A-5) or inciting, aiding, or encouraging 
other persons to engage in such conduct. If substantial 
obstruction or disruption is threatened or occurs, the 
president, or a designee, may issue a disciplinary 
suspension warning. The minimum disciplinary penalty for 
violation of this subsection during the period of such war- 
ning shall be suspension for the remainder of the semester 
(or summer session) during-which the offense occurred and 
for the next full academic semester and any intervening 
summer session thereafter. However, a more severe 
disciplinary penalty may be imposed.

threatens or endangers the health or safety of any other 
person, whether or not such conduct occurs on university 
property. 

e. Theft, attempted theft, or damage of or to property of 
the university or of a member of the university community 
or campus visitor. 



f. Unauthroized entry, or use, or occupancy of university 
facilities. 

g. Violation of any university. rule governing student 
organizations, or the use of university property (including 
the time, place, and manner of meetings or demonstrations 
on university property), or of any other university rule 
which is reasonably related to the orderly operation of the 
university ; provided, however, that no disciplinary penalty 
shall be imposed in aity such case unless it is shown that the 
accused student knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable 
care, should have known, of the rule in question. 

h. Use, possession, or distribution of narcotics or 
dangerous drugs, except as expressly permitted by law. 

i. Lewd, indecent, or obscene conduct or expression on 
university property. 

j. Failure to comply with directions of university officials 
acting in the performance of their duties. 

k. Any conduct which substantially threatens or in- 
terferes with the maintenance of appropriate order and 
discipline in the operation of the university, or any conduct 
on university property or in connection- with a university 
activity which invades the rights of others. 

3. Demonstrations. Any individual or group activity or 
conduct, apparently intended to call attention to the par- 
ticipants' point of view on some issues, is not of itself 
misconduct. Demonstrations which do not involve conduct 
beyond the scope of constitutionally-protected rights of free 
speech and assembly are, of course, permissible. However, 
conduct which is otherwise improper can not be justified 
merely l)e cause it occurs in the context of a demonstration. 
Demonstrations which involve violations of any subsection 
of Section B-2, will not be permitted. A shident will be 
charged with misconduct for any individual misconduct 
committed by the student in the course of a demonstration. 

5. Status During Disciplinary Proceedings. Except where 
summary action is taken as provided in Section C-7, the 
status of a student charged with misconduct shall not be 
affected pending the final disposition of charges, provided, 
however, that no diploma shall he given and no grades, 
academic credit, or degree shall be awarded to a student 
against whom charges are pending for which a disciplinary 
penalty may be imposed. The effective date of any 
disciplinary penalty shall be a date established by the final 
adjudicating body (Uie dean's office of Uie campus appeals 
tward). In caseofsuspension or expulsion, the student shall 
not be withdrawn any earlier than the date the notice of 
charges originated or later than the effective date 
established by the tinal adjudicating body. 

6. Misconduct Subject to Otfaer Penalties. As provided in 
Chapter 273 of the 1969 Acts of the Indiana General 
Assembly, misconduct which constitutes a violation of 
these rules and regulations may be punished after deter- 
mination of guilt by the procedures herein provided without 
regard to whether such misconduct also constitutes an 
offense under the criminal laws of any state or of the United 
States of whether such conduct might result in civil liability 
of the violator to other persons. 

C. Procedures in Student Misconduct Cases 
1. Disciplinary and Administrative Action Proceedings, 
General. 

a. The procedures hereby established shall be followed in 
all cases in which the university institutes disciplinary 
proceedings or administrative action proceedings against 
students for violations of the rules of student conduct set 
forth in Section B. These procedures shall not apply to or 
affect the jurisdiction or procedures established by shjdent 
organizations or similar organizations. 

b. Disciplinary proceedings are those proceedings 
initiated by the issuance of a notice of charges and are 
governed by the provisions of Section C-1 to 7 inclusive. The 
term "disciplinary proceedings" does not include ad- 
ministrative action proceedings. 

c. Administrative action proceedings are informal in- 
vestigations conducted by the dean's office with a view to 
possible administrative action. Administrative action may 
t&gt;e taken by the dean's office without instituting disciplinary 
proceedings, and such action shall be final and not subject 
to further hearing orappeal. A disciplinary penalty may not 
be imposed without first instituting disciplinary 
proceedings pursuant to Section C-2. If tiie dean's office 
confers with the sbident in the course of administrative 



action proceedings, no statement made by the sbident 
during such conference shall be used against the student in 
any disciplinary proceedings which may thereafter be 
instituted. 

2. Institution of Disciplinary ProceedlngB. 

a. Disciplinary proceedings shall be instituted by the 
dean's office by the issuance of notice of charges. 

b. The notice of charges (and all other written notices 
given to students against whom disciplinary proceedings 
are initiated) shall be delivered by the most effective 
method to the student's address as it then appears on the 
official records of the university. The notice shall inform 
the student of the rule or regulation allegedly violated, also 
fairly inform the student of the reported circumstances of 
the alleged violation, and request the student to appear in 
the dean's office for a hearing on the Incident. A copy of 
these regulations shall accompany each notice of charges. 
A copy of the notice of charges may be sent to the parent or 
guart^an of the student if the student is dependent as 
defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 19M. 

3. Failure to Respond to Charges. If the notice of charges 
requests the student to appear in the dean's office and the 
student fails or refuses to appear, the dean's office may, 
after such investigation as it may deem necessary, 
dismiss the charges, take administrative action, or im- 
pose a disciplinary penalty. If the dean's offlce takes ad- 
ministrative action, it shall notify the student in writing of 
such action, and such action shall not be subject to further 
hearing or appeal. If the dean's office imposes a 
discipUnary penalty, it shall notify the student in writing of 
such action, and the student may appeal such action to the 
campus appeals board as provided in Section C-6. When it 
appears necessary to avoid undue hardship or to avoid 
injustice, the dean's office may extend the time to enable a 
student to respond to the ctiarges. 

4. Response to Charges. 

a. If the student appears in response to the notice of 
charges for the purpose of a hearing of the allied violation 
as provided in Section C-5, the dean's office shall advise the 
student as fully as possible of the facts concerning the 
alleged charges and the names and addresses of witnesses 
then known to the dean's office. The student shall also he 
advised that no response is required, that any statement 
made by the student may be used against the student, that if 
the student remains silent, that silence will not be taken as 
an admission against the student, and that the student may 
advise the dean's office of any witnesses or evidence sup- 
porting the student's position. The dean's office shall also 
advise the student that if any new information is discovered 
during an investigation subsequent to tlie hearing, the 
student will have an opportunity to respond to such in- 
formation. 

b. After the hearing with the student and such further 
investigation as the dean's office deems necessary, the 
dean's office shall proceed as follows: 

1. If the deaifs office determines that the violation 
alleged is not supported by the evidence, the charges shall 
be dismissed and the student notified. 

2. If the dean's office is satisfied that the violation oc- 
curred as alleged, but that no disciplinary penalty shall be 
imposed, the dean's office may take administrative action 
and notify the student. Such action by the dean's office shall 
be final and not subject to further hearing or appeal. 

3. If the dean's office is satisfied that the violation oc- 
curred as alleged and that a disciplinary penalty should be 
imposed, the dean's office shall so notify the student. 

5. Conduct of Hearing. Each hearing shall be conducted 
before one or more members of the dean of students office 
staff and, although the hearing is informal in nature, it shall 
provide the student certain procedural safeguards. 

The student shall be given the opportunity to bear the 
evidence against him-her, rebut statements made by 
witnesses, present witnesses, evidence, or any relevant 
information in the student's own behalf. The student shall 
also be given the opportunity to respond to any new in- 
formation gathered during an investigation subsequent to 
the hearing. The dean of student's office has the burden of 
proving the student guilty of the alleged violation, and the 
decision of the dean's office shall be based solely on in- 
formation introduced at the hearing and obtained during 
subsequent investigations. 

No person other than the student shall be present during 
the discussion between the dean's office and the student 
except by mutual agreement of the dean's office and the 
student. 

Within five days following the conclusion of the hearing 
and subsequent investigation, the dean's office shall notify 
the student, in writing, of what action it will take. The 
decision letter shall contain a finding as to the guilt or in- 
nocence of the student and a brief statement of the reasons 
for the decision. Any disciplinary penalty imposed or ad- 
ministrative action taken is subject to the provisions of 
Section B-4 of this regulation and any other university rule, 
regulation, or directive then existing. 

6. Appeal of the Dean's Office Decision. The student may 
appeal the decision of the dean's office to the campus ap- 
peals board. An appeal may be initiated by filing a notice of 
appeal with the campus appeals board through the dean's 
office or with the chair of the campus appeals board. Such 
an appeal must be filed within seven days of the date on 



AUGUST 12, 1982— THE STUDENTS' HANDBOOK— PAGE 17 



the letter from the dean's office containing the decision, and 
the appeal must be personally signed by the student. Tbe 
dean's office will provide the campus appeals board with a 
copy of the notice of charges and the decision letter sent to 
the student. The university will be represented at the ap- 
peal hearing by the dean's office or other appointed 
representative. 

7. Summary Action. Summary disciplinary action by way 
of temporary suspension and exclusion from universi^ 
proper^ may be taken against a student charged witii 
misconduct without the issuance of a notice of charges and 
without the procedures prescribed in Section C on the 
following conditions: Summary action shall be taken only 
by the president of the university or by an authorized vice 
president of the university, and only after the student shall 
have been given an opportunity to be heard if such 
procedure is practical and feasible under the cir- 
cumstances. Summary action shall be taken only if the 
president or vice president is satisfied that the continued 
presence of the student on university property threatens 
harm to the student or to any others. Whenever summary 
action is taken under this Section C-7, the procedures 
provided for in Section C for hearing and appeal shall be 
expedited so far as possible in order to shorten the period of 
summary action. 

D. The Campus Appeals Board 

1. Organization and Jurisdiction. 

A campus Appeals board shall be established for each 
campus of the university. 

2. Conduct of Appeal 

a. The campus appeals board may prescribe regulations 
governing the conduct of the appeals not inconsistent with 
these regulations. The appeal hearing shall be open to the 
public or closed as the campus appeals board shall deter- 
mine. If a hearing is to be open to the public, the campus 
appeals board may change the place of hearing, and its 
determination of the place and of the number of advisors 
and observers that can be convenienUy accommodated 
shall be final. Notice of a change of place shall be given 
promptly to the student. An official tape recording shall be 
made of the appeal which shall be kept by the campus 
appeals board for at least one year. 

The student is entitled to be present at the appeal and to 
be accompanied by advisors of the student's choice. The 
student may also be represented by legal counsel, provided 
he-she files a statement of such intention, giving the name 
and address of such counsel to the chair or secretary of the 
campus appeals board at least 48 hours before the time of 
the hearing. If the university intends to be represented at 
such hearing by legal counsel, the accused student shall t&gt;e 
notified of that in writing at least 72 hours before the time of 
the hearing. If the student has given such notice and is 
entitled to t&gt;e represented by legal counsel, the university 
may also be represented by legal counsel regardless of any 
previously expressed intention to the contrary. The student 
shall have the right to confront and cross-examine wit- 
nesses and to present witnesses and evidence in the 
student's behalf. At the hearing, the burden of proving the 
student guilty of the alleged violation shall be on the 
university. The campus appeals board shall consider any 
evidence relevant to the incident. 

b. The campus appeals board shall decide the appeal and 
issue its written decision within ten days after the date of 
the appeal hearing, except where the president of the 
university authorizes additional time. Copies of its decision 
shall be furnished to the student, the president's office, and 
the dean's office. 

If the decision being appealed found the student guilty 
and imposed a disciplinary penalty, the campus appeals 
board shall have the power either: 

— To reverse the finding and acquit the student 

— To affirm the finding and the disciplinary penalty 
proposed by the dean's office. 

— To affirm the finding and in cases where a proposed 
disciplinary penalty is l)elieved inappropriate to the 
niisconduct, to reduce or increase the severity of the 
disciplinary penalty or to direct that appropriate ad- 
ministrative action be taken by the dean's office in lieu of 
any disciplinary penalty. 

3. Appeals from the Dean's Office. The campus appeals 
tward shall hear each case appealed from the dean's office 
and the procedures to initiate such appeals shall be as 
provided in Section C-€. 

4. Appeals Concerning Recognition of Student 
Organizations. The campus appeals tward shall have 
jurisdiction to hear and shall be required to hear any appeal 
taken by a student organization which the dean's office has 
refused to recognize or from which recognition has been 
withdrawn. In such cases, the campus appeals Iward shall 
either affirm or reverse the decision, and its action shall be 
final. 

5. Appeals from Student Supreme Court The campus 
appeals board shall have discretionary jurisdiction to hear 
appeals from the student supreme court. In such cases, it 
may affirm or reverse a decision, and its action shall be 
final.

^82' ^83 financial 
aid is available 



THURSDAY, AUG. 12. 1982 THE CX)MMUNICATOR —3 



By JIM CHAPMAN 
Managing Editor 

For those students won- 
dering if they can still apply 
for a Pell Grant or 
Guaranteed Student Loan 
(GSL) for the 1982-83 school 
year, the answer is yes. The 
funds, however, will not 
arrive for six to eight weeks, 
according to Mark Franke, 
Director of Financial Aids at 
IPFW. 

"If a student is eligible for 
a Pell Grant, he will get it," 
Franke said. "The money 
will not run out." 

GSLs. however, are a 
different story. 

"If a student applies for a 
GSL at his or her bank, there 
may be a problem," he said. 
"Some banks have stopped 
lending." 

Students can apply for '83- 
'84 financial aid in January 
of '83. Franke said. The 
preferred deadline for '83-'84 
applications is March 1, 1983, 
he added. 

Franke gave two reasons 
for this deadline. The first 
reason is so the financial aid 
office can meet the state 
deadline, which is also 
March 1. 



The second reason is to 
rank the applications in 
order of their need. 

"It takes a lot of time to 
award financial aid," 
Franke said. "We don't have 
enough funds to go around so 
we use the March 1 deadline 
to get the applications in as 
early as possible so we can 
rank them." 

Applications are evaluated 
according to how soon the 
application is completed (the 
students must answer all 
required questions) and the 
degree of the students' 
fmancial needs, Franke said. 

Last April, Fourth District 
Congressman Dan Coats told 
The Communicator that 
financial aid will not t&gt;e cut 
in the 1983 Federal budget. 
Franke still agrees with this 
statement and said IPFW 
has more aid this year than 
last year. 

"We have 15 percent more 
dollars committed to 
students and 10 percent more 
student loans than last 
year," Franke said. 

Although there is more 
aid, some students lost their 
eligibility this past year, 
Franke said. 



Because of a state law 
enacted this year, the 
eligibility of students who 
are GI Bill or Social Security 
recipients will be dropped or 
reduced, Franke said. 
Students living in higher 
income brackets will also be 
denied, he added. 

"Many of those students 
who have "been found to be 
ineligibte are upset. We have 
suggested that they explore 
other possibilities on an 
individual basis. For 
example, we told some who 
became ineligible for Fell 
Grants to try for GSL," 
Franke said. 

One of President 

Reagan's proposals was to 
limit the GSL program to 
undergraduate students 
only, leaving graduate and 
professional students short 
Uiis form of aid to complete a 
part of their higher 
education. 

Although Reagan made 
this proposal, Franke said 
the students have nothing to 
worry abut. 

"There is still talk going on 
about it, but it (the proposal) 
is dead," Franke said. 



Tast Food Fort' to 
open in Athletic Center 



By JACKIE WIORA 

Copy Editor 
Last March 32 inches of 
sewer water flooded the 
ground floor of Walb 
Memorial Union. The 
flooding caused The Fort 
cafeteria to close down in- 
definitely, as employees 
cleaned and disinfected the 
contaminated area. 

Within one month after the 
flood, the kitchen in The Fort 
was operable, according to 
John Herring, District 
Supervisor for ARA. But the 
cafeteria remained closed 
through the spring semester 
and is not expected to open 
for two to three more 
months. Herring said. 

"Our main problem is the 
paneling in the dining 
room," he said. "It has to be 
replaced because it's curling 
off the wall. Also, the wooden 
tables and chairs were all 
destroyed by the water and 
we had to wait for bids on the 
new ones. The award for the 
liid just came through." 



IPFW students and staff 
will not have to go hungry 
while waiting for the Fort to 
reopen, however. ARA is 
planning to have a "Fast 
Food Fort" in the Athletic 
Center. 

The temporary cafeteria 
will be located in the 
multipurpose area of the 
center. "The surroundings 
(in the multipurpose area) 
aren't as nice (as the dining 
room in The Fort)," Herring 
said, "but we will be able to 
set up there everyday and 
that's better than moving 
from building to building." 

The planned seating in the 
multipurpose area will only 
accommodate 192 people — 
halt the number The Fort 
was able to hold, Herring 
said. 

Although it appears there 
may be a seating problem. 
Herring said it may not be as 
bad as it seems. "The Port 
dining room was often 
crowded at lunch," he said, 
"but a lot of the tables were 
taken up by people studying. 
They probably won't be 



doing that in the Athletic 
Building." 

The food will be cooked in 
the kitchen of The Fort, 
Herring explained, and then 
moved to the Athletic Center 
where it will be made 
available on a self-serve 
basis. 

The cafeteria will 
probably contam four major 
areas: an American area 
offering hot dogs, a soup and 
salad bar, a Mexican area, 
and a beverage counter, 
Herring said. 

"Our biggest problem is 
going to be getting the people 
to go that extra lOD yards to 
theAthleticCenter,"hesaid. 
"We'll have to do something 
to get their interest and keep 
them coming back." 

The food at the temporary 
cafeteria will probably not 
cost any more than it did at 
The Fort in the past. Herring 
said. "We have to maintain 
the prices we had in the past 
as much as possible. We 
don't want to price ourselves 
out of business." 



DUE TO THE FLOODING DF THE WALB MEMORIAL 
UNION, THE CAFETERIA IS CLOSED FOR 
REMGDEUNG. ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN 
MADE FOR LUNCHEON FOOD SERVICE TO BE 
PROVIDED IN THE GYMNASTICS AREA DF 
THE MULTIPURPOSE BUILDING. 

LUNCHES SERVED 11:00-1:30 p.m. DAILY 



Add leadership 

to your 
college schedule. 

College military science courses are courses 
in leadership development. They offer you 
management experiences which will benefit 
you in any career, civilian or military. 

You can take the first courses as a freshman 
or sophomore without obligation. Advanced 
courses, in your junior and senior years, lead 
you to a position of responsibility as an officer 
in the active Army or Reserves. 

As an Army ROTC student, you'll also have 
the opportunity to compete for 3 and 2-year 
full tuition scholarships. And you'll earn near- 
ly $2000 during your last 2 years of college. 

Don't wait until after college to get practical 
management experience. Add leadership 
to your class schedule now.
