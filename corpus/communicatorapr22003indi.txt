simple words from a mentor. 

If a man needs a long inlro-

deserve it. And if a man 
deserves a long introduction, he 
probably doesn't need it," 
McGill said.

sented by IPFW Professor 
Hector Garcia. The

Along with McGiU and 
Garcia, Fori Wayne Mayor

Tutu. 

Also taking part in the fes-

Battling against South 
Africa's apartheid system 
through words. Tutu was given 
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1914 In 
the 19K0s, he was named bishop 
of Johannesburg and then arch- 
bishop of Cape Town for the 
Anglican Church.

by the Freedom Medal and their 
presence. 

The focus of his talk was the 
ability of forgiveness between all 
people He spoke of brutality 
between people of different 
races, cultures and religions 
Tutu remembered the days in 
South Africa when the people 
were happy to leam only six or 
eight black people had been 
killed in the day's violence. 

"It seemed as if the violence 
w,i&gt; e.ning to be endemic," he 
said. A famous quote from Tutu 
in the days of apartheid pon- 
dered what would happen to 
lesiis if he returned in the coun- 
try of Tutu's life. "If Christ 
returned to South Africa today, 
he would almost certainly be 
detained under the present secu- 
rity laws because of his concern 
for the poor, the hungry and the 
oppressed," Tutu once said. 

He spoke of a parable of a 
man who was falling over a 
ledge He grabbed onto a twig 
at Ihe last second. The man 
looked toward the sky and 
asked for help A voice came 
Iron the heavens. Tutu said. He 
spoke Ihe two parts in separate 
voices. One deep voice, one 
high-pitched. 

My son, do vou trust me?" 

"Yes." 

"Let go of the twig, and I 
will catch you before you reach 
the bottom." 

silence. Tutu noted. Then the 
man holding onto the twic, spoke 
again ' K there anybody else up 
there?'' The parable was met 
with laughter by the audience. 

Tutu recalled Ihe days leading

But Mandela did not do what 
people expected, Tulu said. At 
his inauguration, he had his 
white jailer attend. As presi- 
dent, he spent time speaking 
with the prosecutor who wanted

and his son were invited to eat 
with Mandela. 

"We should sit., we should 
listen to one another . that we 
should consider an enemy as a

Mandela's reaction.

It's just prettv amazing to see 
what it's become. It's bizarre. 
But it's a great feeling," [ared 
Fogle said Wednesday. 

Fogle is not known by his 
last name. He's known most 
commonly as fared from 
Subway. His nationwide com- 
mercials tell of him losing 245 
pounds of his 42s pound body 
through a Subway diet and a 
moderate exercise program. He 
said some surveys suggest over 
90 percent of Americans know of 
him or his stoiy. 

"There's a lot worst things 
to be known as than the Subwav 
guv.'' |.irvd said. Fogle -.poke at 
the 1-lth Annual Health and 
Wellness Fair held at [I'FW on 
March 26. Judy Tillapaugh, a 
registered dietician and 
he.illh wellness coordinator at 
IPFW, was pleased Jared came to 
campus. 

"He has such a motivating 
story to share with us all, 
Tillapaugh said. "He's just a real 

Eerson. He accomplished a 
uge goal that so many of us 
struggle with." 

During his weight loss of 
over 215 pounds in one year, 
Fogle had regular check-ups 
with a doctor. He also walked. 
And he dealt with feeling hun- 
gry. Feeling hungry is something 
one has to deal with it planning 
on getting healthy from a mor- 



bidly obese state, he said. 

"We in America, we don't 
like to be hungry. We want fo 
feel full. We like to Super Size. 
We like to King Size We like to 
Biggie Sue," he said. "We're not 
used fo being hungry in this 
country," Fogle added, noting 
that portions of food here are 
excessive Physically, nobody 
needs 12 ounces of meat for a 
meal, according to Fogle. 

While he promotes Subwav 
and the fact that that's how he 
lost the weight, he emphasizes 
everyone is different and needs 
to find something that will work 
for them. Subway helped him, 
and it's something people 
should consider, he said. 
Looking back af his life, he 
believes he was overweight hv 
third grade and obese by middle 

The Indianapolis native 
showed a pair of 60-inch jeans he 
used to wear. In 1998, he was 20 
years old and weighed 425 
pounds. "Being that weight at 
that time of my lite was not a fun 
thing at all. Vou're supposed to 
be having the tune of vour life in 
college but I was having none 
of that," he said. He was an 
Indiana University sophomore 
But college wasn't foremost on 
his mind. 

"All I wanted to think 
about was where I was going lo 
get my nest meal. That's all 1 
cared about," Fogle noted- After 
he moved out of a dorm, he real-

The difference here is thai you're engaged lo your mama and 
plan to eventually even ool the tallies, but for some girls, "sugar 
daddy" will never be repaid! I Ihink the pniblem some ot your female 
friends may be having with your situabon is that Ihey aren't used lo 
your type of lifestyle in which you're Ihe one king taken care of." 

Not all females seek equality for self-benefit, however. There 
are some whom want Ihe fairness for all of human-kind While 
there may always be an issue of rights between Ihe sexes, it's time 
for people to realize that times are a'changin'! 

Deal with it girls! It's alright for the guy to be a little more 
dependent on us In my opinion, it S kinda nice to know you're 
needed — not just financially, but just to know that we CAN take 
care of them sometimes... it's kinda nice!

My Subway hero 



On Oct. 19, 2002, when I 
decided lo do something .iboi.il 
my weight, I thought about a 
Subway commercial 1 saw fea- 
turing Jared Fogte. What an 
inspiration! He Inst 24.5 pounds 
in a year eating Subway sand- 
wiches and walking. 

Imagine my excitement in 
hearing that Fogle was going to 
be making a personal appear 
ance at IPFW's Health Fair on 
Wednesday, March 26 in Walb 
Union. My inspiration, my hero, 
was going lo be in Fori Wavnc 
at my school. The school thai 
serves Subway sandwiches and 
has the Hilliard Gate-. Sports 
Center where I have developed 
on ongoing daily relalinoship 
with Flhplical Machine M. 

I arrived at high noon with 
Ihe hope-, ol meeting Fogle to 
ask him several prepared i|oes 
lions thai may help other'- join 
in on the Subway diet. 1 know 
from Ihe commercials thai he 
enjoyed several types of 
Subway sandwiches, bul I have 
remained totally devoted to my 
turkey on whole wheal si\-ioch 
Subway sandwich with nothing 
else on it. (To add variety, some 
days 1 have Ihe low lal potato 
chips, other days I have 1-1-16 oo 
fat pretzels, and I also h.ivedavs 
with a baked potato plain to 
make the meal.) 

I approached the "woman 
at Ihe podium" lo see if I could 
ask Fogle a lew .|ueslions lor 
this article that I wanted to 
wrile for The L.uinmoiri.alei She 
said the interview* were alread\ 
done, but she checked with him 
and he said okay. I was lo meet 



on stage with him afler his pres- 
entation with Caramy 
Whilmore of the IPFW 
Hospitality Management 
Program Whitmnre and Fogle 
put together a lengthy Subway 
sandwich based on the items the 
audience wanted on the abun- 
dant, flavorful Subway sand- 
wich. Then Ihe audience lined 
up for their "lunch" sections of 
the Subway sandwich that had 
been cut to size so everyone 
who wanted this taste treat 
could partake in this experience 

After the food was distrib- 
uted, "my time" had come, ft 
was time to meel Fogle and ask 
him my qoestib'ns. 

I was interested in knowing 
why he decided to lo.,- weight 
According lo Fogle, he "finally 
loreed himself to look in the 
mirror lor the first time in seeen 
or eighl years." He also was 
experiencing some health con- 
cerns related lo his sleeping 
cycle Similarly, I finally looked 
in the mirror as well after another 

Eerson asked me who was in a 
ve-year-old photo. That "who" 

1 questioned if he had a set 
weighl loss goal and if he met or 
beat his goals "I had no idea 
what my goal was to lose 
weighl. I just losl 2-15 pounds 
oeer a year's period of time by 
earing Subway sandwiches and 
walking a mile or two each 
day," Fogle said. I lost my 
weight eating my six-inch 
turkey on whole wheat with 
nothing else on it and doing at 
least ill minutes a day on the 
elliptical machine al Gates 



And 









sandwiches 1 ' 
to a Subw 

fat/low calorie diet appealed I 
me," Fogle said. 

When asked what change 
he had noticed in himself alter 
losing weight, jared said that 
Everything has changed for the 
positive Mv self-confidence has 
certainly grown." 

It's interesting to note, 
when one loses weight, sell 



now come to me to affirm i_._ 
and my discipline in attaining 
my weight loss. 

The Horizon looks brighter 
for Fogle doe to his life experi- 
ence. He hopes lo write a book 
within Ihe next year and 
become a motivational speaker. 
Whpn asked if he had any 
"words of wisdom" for people 
whowanl to lose weight, Fogle 
responded that "the inspiration 
to lose weighl comes from with- 
in yourself. You have to want to 
work hard to achieve this goal." 

It is no wonder that Fogle 
is "my Subway hero." He is 
approachable, personable and 
wants to help others, such as 
myself. He has served as an 
example to me and others of 
what can be achieved if one 
focuses on weight loss, modifies 
eating habits and includes eier- 
the daily routine.

taken of Fogle and myself

pounds that neither of us are 
going to miss.

War Rallies pH 

paid much attention to your coverage of peace 
rallies over the past few months, I must note that 
your article on the Rally For America is a bit 

While Ihe placement and length of the arti- 



"rally," v 

by comn 

rallies at the courthoi 

informed of an event 



n this 



keungand then just to show up to beer 

then it is to organize with little financial support 
and markel through word-of-mouth and hand 
made flyers. 

Come lo think ol it. Ihe difference between 
Ihe so-called Rally tor America and the numerous, 
bul less well attended peace rallies can be attrib- 
uted to the difference between being a consumer 
and an active citizen While that may not be sur- 
prising, the reporting on the Rally For America 
was incomplete without the identification of the 
oiganizers. 



So Says Kevin 

Dear Mr. Vance, 

I came across your response the other day, 
to my article on Espn.com about Lcbron James 
("Vou don 'I pay. Van ,feu'&lt; p/uy." 2/5) First of all, lei 
me say. I enjoy a good debate like anyone else, 
and appreciate your comments, even Ihe mis- 
guided ones 

In your article, you ..ailed l.ebron James a 
"thief," what did he steal? He accepted two jer- 
seys that were given to him in exchange for a pic- 
lure: he didn't lake them It he stole the jerseys, 
he'd be in jail. He's no! a thief. How can you 
blame a kid (or accepting a couple of jerseys 
when everyone around him Ls cashing in, inclod- 
ing the i. )l ISSA ? In case vol. missed it. last week- 
end 18,^5 fares, a state finals record, made the 
trek lo Columbus lor Lebron's final game. How 
much of that money went lo Lebron? None ol it. 

Dru Joyce is right— we the media are guiltv 
of hvping up Lebron, and like any kid, he sucked 
it alfin. But you can't compare Lebron loa normal 
celebrity because he hasn't received a penny. 



Celebrities: pay a price for their lame, bul at the 
same time they are rewarded Imagine it sour 
school made hundreds ol thousands ol dollars, 
off your articles, you wouldn't allow it. Lebron 
James sells, and we, like many other media out- 
lets, used his image lo make money. 

Sarah Hughes, Ty Tryon, Camille on 
American Idol, thev are all teenagers who have 
cashed in on their celebrity -lalus, thankfully, 
now so will Lebron. The besl part of thai, Ihe 
gravy train ends tor all those who got a free ride 
this year. 

What's Ihe difference between Lebron 
accepting two jerseys and all the stuff that these 
kids get in the summer for .mending camps? 
Nike and Adidas lavish the phaiiesl gear on 
Ihese players year around (Didn't you notice 
those uni's his team wore'), whal's Ihe diiieivnce? 

I did a web search for articles about Lebron

Chris Feay displays 

The Power of Women' 

Theatre production conveys what it's like to be a modern woman 



knowing whal exactly I 
should expect lo see. The 
department of theatre was 
purling on a Studio 
Showcase production, "The 
Power o( Women" directed 
by senior Chris Feay. I knew 
better than lo think that I 
would come in contact with 
a large number of militant 
feminists, because this cam- 
pus just isn't that way I jus! 
wondered if 1 would really 
"get" whal the production 
was trying lo say. 

I am taking a literature 
class this semester 
called "Experimental 
Women Writers This deals 
with works such as those 
Written by Virginia Woolf, 
Hilda Dooliltle (H.D.), 
Anais Nin, et cetera. 
Occasionally there are ideas 
in the text Ihat I just cannot 
grasp. Thai I cannot wrap 
my mind around, maybe 
purely for the fact that 1 am 
nol a woman. ] was appre- 
hensive that this may be the 
case in "The Power ol 
Women " 

Luckily for me and ever) 1 
other man there (which, sur- 
pfisingly, was about half the 
audience), this was not the 
case. I understood it perfect- 
ly' 

; .1 think that my favorite 
one-act was the first seg- 
ment in the lineup, "Lives of 
the. Great Waitresses." This 
dpened with a lively tune in 
vjhjch the (our women 
idors in it danced nut. It 
told the story of four wait- 
resses at a little truck-slop 
diner, with funny mono- 
logues from each lady. You 
needn't any experience in 
food service to appreciate 
the hilarious lines, like 
when Natalie Jones's char- 
acter, Kay. was talking 
about the greatest waitress 
of all time, Flo: "If Jesus 
Himself (Amen) came in 
and sat down to supper, he 
frould've tipped double." 
I : Next in the line-up was a 



intensely by Jane Rebel 
Fraiier. "We Keep Our 
Victims Ready." This 
Seemed (o deal with the 
rights women have to their 



bodies. ("It's my body; it's 
not Pepsi's body; it's not 
Congress's body* ( 

Right alter came a mono- 
logue called "Body Talk," 
Eer formed by Corinne 
'iLorenzo, dealing with 
falling in love and Ihen 
drifting apart. She present- 
ed it very sultry and then 
bittersweet. 

Perhaps the most memo- 
rable one-act in ihe per- 
formance came next. It was 
one thai 1 have heard of 
before, called "The Most 
Massive Woman Wins," by 
Madeleine George. This tells 
the story of four different 
women in the waiting room, 
apprehensive about getting 
liposuction treatments. It 
was in teres ting, yes. but I'm 
afraid that parts of it were 
kind of annoying lo me 
There were times when they 
all got together and chanted 
playground, jump-rope 
rhymes. I realize the signifi- 
cance behind it, but there is 
just a point where grown 
women shouldn't try lo talk 
like children. 

Alter a short intermis- 
sion, we came back lo sec 
five of these talented 
women perform "What it 
Feels Like for a Girl," a 
Madonna song. This song, 
however, wasn't sung; it 
was spoken. Not being a big 
Madonna Ian, 1 have never 
heard it before. 

Maybe the most power- 
ful segment, at least to 
me, was the 

following one-act, "Dancing 
with a Devil," about a 
young 

single city woman who was 
raped. Jaime Fry, playing 
the younger woman, was 
forced lo do a very rough 
box step-like dance with 
Frazier. who played the 
rapist. Both these women 
and Brittney Coughlin. 
playing Fry's character in 
modern-day, were very 
K»od, very powerful. 

IPFW's very own Betsy 
Breitenbach of "D.C. al 
Fine'" and "Atlas's Cigar" 
fame, wrote a short mono- 
logue called "The Lover," 
about a woman who is in a 
relationship with a poet, 
who writes on her erotically. 
While this was. in my opin- 
ion, not of the caliber of 
Breilenbach's aforemen- 



tioned works, I enjoyed Liz 
Printe's euph o nc i n lerp re la- 
tum of the work. 

Kendra Clauser then per- 
formed a monologue abuut 
breast cancer, called "My , 
Left Breast." Her character, 
a proudly self- proclaimed 
"One-breasted, 
menopausal, Jewish, bisex- ' 
ual, lesbian mom," was a 
slrong women who faced , 
her chemotherapy and early ' 
transition into menopause 
without fear, inspired along 
the way by her son. 

The last piece, and per- 
haps the most hilarious, was I 
an expert performance by ' 
Shannon Clark of "I Enjoy 
Being a Girl," a 
showtune from Rodgers 
and Hammerslcin's 

"Flower Drum Song." 
Clark's character quiW obvi- 
ously did NOT enjoy being 
a girl. She stomped out 
onstage wilh a large bag full 
of deodorants, shaving 
creams, face cleansers, cot- 
ton balls, eyelash curlers, 
maxi-pads, hose and high- 
heeled shoes. While singing 
this innocent, happy and 
clearly deluded song (wilh 
sickeningly sweet lyrics 
such as "When I have a 
brand new hairdo / With 
my eyelashes all in curl / I 
float as the clouds on air do 
/ I enjoy being a girl!"), 
Clark runs about the stage, 
pulling on hose, face 
masque, curlers, elc, all the 
while making it look as 
uncomfortable as she can. 

All in all. I really enjoyed 
this production. Mv theatre-
