Elettj-ical engineering technology students (mm MassachusMls have found 
IPFW and Fori Wayne both an tnleresltng, and al times differenl, place (o study

Hip aludenls came lo IPFW from Berkshire Community Qillege. a two-year 
college which Is located nc« lo Ihe New York border in Piltslield. Mass, Ed Gark.

Ron Emery, acting chflirmnn ol EET, sold there aren't many (our-year 
programs available inmany Massachusetts colleges, and that sludenls muslleave 
the state lo get a Bachelor of Sc;Eiice degree He also said thai Clark "sold" the 
aludenls 00 IPFW by showing them Ihe lacllilles aheadof lime. 

David Walker, senior, pointed out that the cost ol living is "much lower here 
than In Massachusetts." In Mossadiuselts an aponmenl comparable to (hat ol 
Canlsbivy Creoi would be more eipeoilve. 

Another student. Charles Deridey. said Ihe doss slnKluies ol the two schools

Michael Dowoi, another Policy

"It'sreally tough being (ar away Irom home," Mcisl said. During vacations and

EPC oversteps 
its boundaries 



In the ITDD's, a revolution was (ought 
over the Idea of taxation without 
representation. Today, II exists at IP- 
FW, or wiJI if the Educational Policy 
Committee of the Fort Wayne Faculty 
senate passes a proposed resolution 

The committee is considering a 
proposal that would disallow students 
with a cumulative grade point average 
or below 2 on the It) scale or l&gt;elaw 4 on 
the Purdue scale from participating In 
certain extracurricular acli^ities 

The 11 extracurricular aclivilics 
funded Inpart by lhcI20sludcnt activity 
fee are the ones that will be afrected. 
This is taxation without represents lion. 

The II activities are students' 
govemmenl. Purdue- Indiana Theatre, 
the Student Union Board of Governors, 
the division of music, the child care 
center, fine arts department, the 



Indiana-Purdue Forensic League, in- 
tramurals, club sports, cheerleaders 
and inlercollegisle athletics. 

Students enrolled in nine or more 
credit hours pay the activity fee, 
whether they want to or not. Students 
also elect a students' government. The 
students' government, representing the 
students, should be making decisions 
concerning who may (larticipate and 
who may not. The faculty does not pay 
the student activity fee The faculty does 
not elect students' government. The 
faculty should not be setting policy on 
who may participate and whocan't. 

The committee will meet Feb. 12 in 
room 178 of Kettler Hail at 2:30 p.m. to 
discuss the mcasiire. We urge every 
student to attend this meeting. Let 
faculty know it cannot dictate policy 
with our money
