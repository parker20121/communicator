IPFW mentors help 
graduates look for jobs 



By Laura Uneback 
Chter Reporter 

"Preparing for ihe Job search-Jiow 
10 cffeciivoly market yourseir' was 
the topic of a panel discussion pie- 
scmcd 01 ihc Fcbmaiy 18 "Mentoring 
Manifesto" breakfast hold in Walb 
Memorial Union Building. Room 
02 1 . The event was sponsored by the 
School of Business and Manage- 
ment Sciences and ihc IPFW Alumni 
Association. 

Interested students and faculty in 
business and organizaiional leader- 
ship-related studies were invited to 
acquaint themselves with the mentor- 
ing program in which IPRV alumni 
are matched with the students prepar- 
ing to enter the job market. Cuncnt 
mentors and their proteges were also 
proseni and shared experiences of 
iheir working relationships. 

Host for Ihe event was Deborah 
Conklln, director of Undergraduate 
Student Affairs in Business and Man- 
agement Sciimccs, 

Brondn Fishbaugh, president of 
Eyo-Pio and an IPFW alumna 
(B.S.'80), presented a history of the 
mentoring program for business and 
marketing students which she and 
business ulumna. Dcnise Simon co- 
founded. The idea come to the women 
af^er they considered the case of a lop 
IPFW marketing siudcnt. who was 
disappointed wiih her fir^t marketing 
job. She found thai the campaign she 
had been hired lo direct involved 
more than what she expected. She 
eventually returned to IPFW to sivdy 
counseling. 

Fishbaugh had observed that new 
graduates were sometimes disappoint- 
ed with the Jobs diey procured upon 
graduation. 

"What wo wanted to do was to pe- 
vont that from happening," said Fish- 
baugh. "The mentoring program was 
established to give students expeii- 
once in various business environ- 
ments during their dme as students," 
she said. 

Students in other professions, such 
as nursing, teaching, and engineering, 
have the advantage of the pracUcum 
required by the respective schools. 
School of Business students have no 
such amtngcmcnis, noted Fishbaugh. 
She also feels that the ideal time to 
gel Involved in career and employ- 
mem Investigations is as early as die 
sc^homore year. 

Mentors arc IPRV alumni who are 
successfully employed and volunteer 
10 advise students at&gt;out preparation 
for the job search, including how to 
lake advantage of nctworlung. 

IPFW marketing nmor Chris Met- 
ller met his mentor white he was in- 
volved in a promotion campaign for 
the IPFW baseball program. His men- 
tor. Janci Idcn Kamdar (B.S- '78, 
M.S.B.A. '83). provided him with the 
contacts to effect a successful cam- 
paign. 

Kamdar, who works with Xerox 
Corporation, also helped Mcttler 
arrange for interviews with her for- 
mer employer IBM and with a for- 
mer client. The Medical Proiecttve 
Company. 

Mcttler suggested that networking 
begin immediately, even at the men- 
toring breakfast. 

"Meet people here and ask for their 
btuiness cards The more people you 
meet, the more promising your Job 
learch will be. ' said Meidcr. 

Nciworiiing within IPFW bcnefltod 
Becky "I^aganden (B.S. '80) who se- 
cured her first human rcsouitci po*i- 
lion with First Federal Saving and 
Loan Association through the School 
of Business. A second job came about 
through the intervention of Bob 
Baibaus, one-time director of Career 
Services at IPFW, This led to her cup

"My networking is rather exten- 
sive," said Teagarden, "but the pulse 
of it is through EPRV," 

TCagarden is involved in a number 
of Alumni Association and athletic 
program activliics. 

She found that involvement In the 
IPFW spons programs has been par- 
llcularly beneficial for making con- 
tacts. 

"A lot of people like athletics — a lot 
of men are involved in athletics. Let's 
face It, the men are still the people 
who make the decisions in most busi- 
nesses, especially here in Fort 
Wayne," TCagardcn observed, 

Ttagardcn. who soon will become a 
mentor, urged those who attended die 
breakfast meeting to enroll in the 
mentoring program 

"Please get involved-it's a lot of (un 
and a wonderful way lo meet people 
and to know what's going on in the 
cunununiiy," she said. 

"A vast nu^wity of alunuii do stay 
in this area and we are starting to 
move into a position of audiority. And 
wo know an awful lot of people," 
added l^agardcn. 

She also talked about the impor- 
tance of making a good first impres- 
sion, as well as exhibiting profession- 
alism in dio interview process. Ai the 
same lime, siudems should not pre- 
sume to cniCT Q company's top man- 
agemenl position, nor should ihoy ex- 
pect to cam high salaries. But if one 
is capable at his job. he/she will move 
up very quickly, said l^arden, 

Robert S. Barkhaus (Ph.D.. Purdue 
University '74), vice president at Na- 
donal Corporate Consultants, present- 
ed the outlook of the job market in 
die nonhcusl bidlona area. 

"New college graduates should bo 
happy to know that dicre are Jobs out 
there in northeast Indiana." Barkhaus 
pointed out. 

He warned new Job seekers againsi 
limiting their applications for posi- 
dons in the "Fortune 500" class com- 
panies. They would be wise lo look 
into the smaller, yet growing, compa- 
nies, 

Barkhaus said that there has been a 
trend reversal; employment possibili- 
ties arc now greater in small towns 
dun in cities such as Indianapolis and 
Fort Wayne. But Fort Wayne is a 
good field for those who have an en- 
titpreneuriai spirit. 

AcconJing to Barkhaus, on elTeciivo 
job search has three major compo- 
nents: good marketing toots, such as a 
woll-wriiicn resume and good tele- 
phone skills; a marketing plan duit in- 
cludes specifying where the job 
hunter will targcu and a diorough ex- 
ecution of die plan. It is important lo 
give many calls (at least 15) to 
(Tospecdve employers every week. 

Success, or the "hit rate," depends 
on the field one targets, such ai retail 
and health care. Barkhaus believes 
that In the business and marketing 
field, spproxlrrtaiely 2 percent of job 
applications result in response, Tlie 
health professions, such as nursing, 
have s higher rate, approximaicly 
nine of ten successful responses.

Kubik, "This ox- 
copilonal learning 
experience can 
never bo replicated 
in the classroom," 
he added The 
Roman Forum.

"Pan of the adventure is learning to 
cope in a different culture." noted 
Kubik. 

Kubik approaches die Rome trip as 
a personal tour. "I'm showing people 
things 1 know and love, what you 
would never get from an ordinary 
lour guide," he said. 
"Unlike roped-off objccu at an mu-

wldi Italians. A few suggested that 
lemming some Italian prior to die trip 
would have been more benenclol. 

Interested persons should contact 
Kubik at his office in the Engineering

Foreign students face hardships 



By Anita Slelnbacher 
Guest Writer 

The presence of iniemaiional stu- 
dents on any campus has a far-reach- 
ing effect on the students, as well as 
die communiiy; economically, social- 
ly and culturally. 

According lo Beily Folks, IPFW as- 
sistant registrar, ihere are currcnily 
126 students enrolled from 59 coun- 
tries. These students are a vibrant, es- 
seniial aspan of IPRV campus life. 

Dr, Riillip A. Kcnnell, Director of 
International Student Services be- 
lieves that the faculty at IPFW look 
very favorable upon having iniema- 
donal students in dieir ctassrt&gt;oms. 

The three essential factors that 
IPFW and die [mmigraiion and Naiu- 
raliitation Service (INS) seek in a po- 
tential international student are: fi- 
nancially mdependcni during one's 
stay; a good student with a high 
school education; and English protl- 



ciency. Since IPFW accepu only die 
best students, their chmiccs of success 
are higher. 

On the whole, Iniemadonal students 
tend to take their schooling seriously. 
They cannot afford to fail, because if 
dicy go back home widiout a degree, 
Uiere is a tremendous loss of face in- 
volved. Their parents have usually 
made a tremendous sacrifice to send 
them here. 

In much of the worid today, parents 
will sacrifice greatly, and at limes, in- 
cur tremendous debls to provide an 
education for their children. For ex- 
ample, the average exchange rate 
coming from India may be higher 
than 30:1. That means that a rupee 
(die Indian equivalent to the dollar) is 
exchanged as little more than three 
cents for every American dollar, 

Because those students cannot ob- 
tain Federal or State aid, and the INS 
is very strict about working off-cam- 
pus, the siudem will not be admitted 



to die University unless he/she can 
prove ability to pay all potential ex' 
pcnses for tuition and living, for four 
years or more. 

The average estimated living ex- 
penses for a full-time IPI^ interna- 
tional student for die 1992-1993 Fall 
semester was SI5.40O, Compare diai 
amount with the 1992-1993 estimate 
for a full-time Indiana resident, 
S2,5I5. 

Almost all of this money comes 
from overseas. This provides a 
tremendous boost to die campus and 
to the community, since Fon Wayne 
is a non-resident campus. In four 
years, die University and die commu- 
nity could conceivably have absorbed 
over 560,000 from a single interna- 
tional student ! 

Kcnnell believes that Intemailonai 
students at IPFW are enriched for two 
mam reasons: they receive a good ed- 
ucation here and will have benefited 
from living in and knowing 8 differ- 



ent culture, die United Slates, 

Contrary to popular belief, many in- 
lematlonal people do return home. 
When dicse students return as highly 
productive members of their socledes 
to dieir own countries, odier parents 
are more inclined to send ihelr chil- 
dren here. When Americans go over 
to their counirlcs, diese former stu- 
dents relate belter in social and work 
siluadons, since thy have lived In this 
society. 

Some of the contacts mudo by diese 
students while In the United States 
often eventually resuli in a collabora- 
tion of technology, raw material and 
industry for both couniiica. 

The iniemaiional students are the 
beat and brighiesi from other coun- 
tries, they and dielr families have giv. 
en up much lo tend them to IPFW, 
and diey are an irreplaceable asset to 
our community for now and In the 
future.

wjih such a ICM as Writing Argu- 
ments: A Rhetoric for Readings at 



their side. As far as me "sei|iijig| up a 
propagandisiic dichotomy," what is 
that? And is thai legal to do in Indi- 
ana? Am I going to jail? 

I probably wouldn't have written if 
you hadn't mentioned my bud, Kent 
Ziessler, (still a nice guy) in your aru- 
cle. The point I was trying lo make, 
but failed lo. was that there are two 
extreme camps on each side of the 
abortion issue that are seemingly ir- 
reconcilable. Do most people identify 
themselves with either enlreme? 
Sometimes, I find both sides equally 
repulsive. Is there room for modera- 
tion here? It's like my wife and 1 
praclice recycling, but that doesn't 
make us members of Earth First. 

Anyway."Mr, Brunson, there's a 



whole loiia' hurtin' goin' on world- 
wide, as you have thoroughly sub- 
stantiated in your writing. The end- 
less posturing from both sides of the 
issue is getting tiresome and ik:com- 
plishes liiilc towards healing this 
hurling. Tell you what — I'll buy you 
a cup of coffee down in The Fort. 
(Smoking or not?) Heck, if I'm in a 
good mood I'll spring for a candy bar. 
We could discuss all the issues you 
raise. You could astound me with 
your knowledge of world affairs and I 
could wow you with my vast knowl- 
edge of Gilligan's Island trivia. (Not 
dial I'm implying by any means that 
you are Gilligan-dencicnt.) I could 
show you pictures of my four-week 
old son, GraJiam, whom I hope will 



grow up in a world free of the evili 
you descrit&gt;e. I'd think you'd find thai 
we agree on more than we diiogree 
on and we share a lot of the lamc 
concerns, (If noi. wc could alwayi

productive (and use a lot lest timber) 
as filling up The Communicaior with 
more boring leiicrs back and forth 
about atmrtion.

Inmate seeks understanding 



To the Editor: 

1 feel compelled lo write this letter 
because I am so sick and lired of liv- 
ing dishonestly and destroying my 
life. I am an inmate at the Indiana 
Stale Farm. I am incarcerated for a 
probation violation which stemmed 
from a terrible alcohol problem Uiat 
lead me astray. However, 1 ajn now 
alcohol-free and able to honestly ad- 
mit my weaknesses and shortcom- 
ings, I actually hate that I've foolishly 
ruined so many years of my life in jail 
and prison. Although I can't reuaci 
those years, mistakes, and hardships, 
I can at least make sincere efforts to- 
wards changing my life for the better. 

I am hoping this letter leads to the 
betterment of my future, simply by 
sharing a pen-pal friendship with a 
concerned person, who's willing to 



listen and at least try lo understand 
my need-want to excel. Because I am 
sincerely trying to take all the 
garbage from my life, turning it into 
composi, hoping something wonder- 
ful grows from 11, 

I pray that someone hears me out 
and tries to understand what I am ex- 
periencing and my need for reaching 
out for help I whole-heartedly be- 
lieve that by writing ihis leiter, I am 
taking real sieps towards changing 
and wanting to change. 

If I could just receive a letter from a 
concerned person, it would really 
help me,

Christ's death merits holiday 



To the Editor: 

I find it rather disappoiniing thai 
IPFW students get Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day off and not Good Friday. 
While I don't wish to lessen the im- 
pact that Dr. King has had on our so- 
ciety and on the Civil Rtghix Move- 
mcni, il seems lo me that as he is a 
champion of the Civil Righis Move- 



ment and perhaps African-Americans 
in general. Jesus Christ is the champi- 
on of a Christian's life and faith. As 
such, Good Friday should be recog- 
nized as a holiday to commemorate 
the death of our savior,

Rules censor activists 



To (he Editor: 

On Tuesday. Feb. 9th. our campus 
was visited by representatives giv- 
ing away Gideon Bibles. I asked if 
the gentlemen sitting alone if were 
affiliated with a campus organisa- 
tion and was politely lold no. In my 
experience I have attempted lo bring 
outside organi/auons on campus to 
distribuic information on various 
poliiical issues. Each time I was mei 
with great opposition neccssitaiing a 
strict following of guidelines. 

In die Spring of 1990 (shortly be- 
fore the iOlh anniversary of Eanh 
Day) Mr. Greg Callen, director of 
student activities, was contacted by 
Green Peace. Green Peace was in- 
terested if they could participate in 
the campus events and perhaps find 
some students who would be inter- 
ested m woriting in protests againsi 
the Maumee River Projcci and ex- 
pansion of the hazardous waste 
dump. As opposed to referring the 
caller to me (I was a student senator 
working on the fesuvities along with 
a Fort Wayne committee,) or lo 
Janie Fink (then president of the bi- 
ology club who was sponsoring a 
week long lecture series on environ- 
mental issues.) Mr. Callen told ihe 
person at Green Peace that such af- 
filiation would be unacceptable and 



promptly hung-up, Mr Callen (old 
me of the phone call only after Ihe 
event was through. 

To bring Poliiical Actlvitti on 
campus is possible but (here are 
rules lo be met — such as iponior- 
ship from a recognized student orga- 
nization, the group must be non- 
protii, and a student muti be preient 
with the AcUviiis at all limes. Re- 
peatedly there are organlzalloni 
which are exempted from iheie 
rules such as the woman tpeaker 
sponsored by a siudcnt Busiiteti Or- 
ganization who sold (for profit) her 
books and tapes after Ihe event and 
today ihcse gentlemen givmg away 
bibles. 

The First Amendment guaranieei 
our righi to free speech yet IPFW 
only permits il when II suits their 
ideology. This is our education, we 
must stand up to the cominuing cen- 
sorship ai IPFW, Our intelligence 
can be challenged, confronted and 
wc can still decide what we accept. 
Don't accept ihis. Call the admlnli- 
traiion and demand your right to

what they will let you hear.

The Communicator 



Obsessive literary explication emanates from brain disorder 



It used 10 be. back when life was 
simple and good, ihat I could read a 
siory and be done wiih ii. That was 
before I had ever heard of words like 
"novella." "imagery," and "motif." In 
this Utopia of readership, I could read 
a book, decide if 1 liked it or nou and 
get on with my life. 

Bui life isn't so simple anymore. 

I have been inflicied with a bad case 
of Literary Interpretation. This is 
the result of a class I'm taking, 
which is cleverly called "Liicraiure 
Interpretation." 

It used 10 be thai I could say of a 
story, "I liked ii," or "I didn't like ii." 
Now, however, as a student of Litera- 
ture, I can'i say that. I would be 
tarred and feathered and beaten with 
hardback copies of "Silas Mamcr" ai 
such a callow remark. 

Now, as a student of Literaiure, I 
have to say things like, "The attitude 
of the work is extraordinarily confi- 
dent in iis subtle use of shading im- 
agery, burning metaphors, and scintil- 
lating symbols, without maning the 
delicate balance of multiple themes 



ranging from man's inhumanity to 
man (represented through street mim- 
icry) to the siaiemcnt that man is ba- 
sically a piranha napped in the body 
of a platypus, with the precarious in- 
nards of an American-made VCR." 
Then, of course, 1 would have to dis- 
cuss each of these points in minute 
detail, trying to remember to rotate 
the use of the following verbs: shows. 
illustrates, portrays, depicts, empha- 
sizes, epilomiz£s, represents, symbol- 
izes, and alludes to. 

The thing that bugs me most about 
literary criticism is the ob.session with 
it. I don't see anything wrong with a 
few intellectuals (or wannabe intel- 
lectuals) sitting in a hip coffee shop 
and discussing whether or not 
Hemingway's works arc indicative of 
a writer who overplayed a macho 
persona in order to hide his latent 
transvesiitism. If that kind of conver- 
sation turns you on, then more power 
to you. 

But many literary criticisms are 
published. And I'm not talking about 
just a few insightful essays on what 



statements -Huckleberry Finn" 
makes about slavery. I'm talking 
about millioru of pages in thousands 
of published books and magazines 
that give theories on every nook and 
cranny of every single line of every 
single page of every sin| 
deemed literary by the 
gods of Literature. 
Short stories that are 
ten pages long have 
hundreds of pages of 
analysis wriiien aboui 
ihem. This to me indi- 
cates a malfunction in 
the Obsession Control 
Lobe of the brain. I 
mean, human beings 
who have been in ther- 
apy for ten yean don't 
even get that much 
analysis. 

The other day, I came 
across ihe following lit- 
erary criticism Ln an obscure literary 
magazine. It is a basic, straighifor- 
ward, elementary analysis. I reprint it 
here as an example of how a faulty 



Obsession Control

Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear. 

Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair. 

Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy. 

Was he? 



Just A Theory 
by Tim Schrelber 



The outward iden- 
tity of the protagonist 
(Fuzzy Wuzzy) is es- 
tablished in the first 
line. He is a bear. 
Wuzzy's characier (his 
dreams, desires, short- 
comings, etc.) is devel- 
oped much more clear- 
ly by the end of the 
second line. The reader 
is confident that he 
knows Wuzzy at this 
point. In knowing 
Wuzzy, he (the reader) 
is keyed in on the basic 
conflict of the narrative: Wuzzy. a 
troubled bear who is trying to find 
some son of identity in himself, is 
struggling with the fact that he "has 



no hair." 

Of course, the symbolism in this 
powerful piece lies in the rccuning 
hair motif, the hair that is a clear alle- 
gory to man's (or bear's) inability to 
be saiisHed with his position in ihe 
universe. The bitter irony of Wuzzy's 
name further pounds this theme into 
the reader. 

The story gids with a twist; as the 
narrator himself questions his own 
perceptions. The narrator, after hav- 
ing dealt with Wuzzy's paradoxical 
predicament, is no longer sure of 
what he can believe in. The mystai- 
ous ending leaves the reader wonder- 
ing, "Was Wuzzy hairless, or was it 
all in his head?" This Hitchcockian 
twist intertwines with one of the ba- 
sic themes of the work: that we can 
never really be sure of anything. 

This cpisiemological message is su- 
perbly presented with the clever use 
of rhyme and repetition, as all of us 
literary critics can agree. 

I don't understand this critique, but 
maybe someday I will. Muybe some- 
day, I'll Icam all the intricacies of lit- 



erary criticism, and as a band of light 
shines down upon mc I will suddenly 
become enlightened. And when 1 en- 
counter someone who is like I am 
now. I will laugh that " you -poor-pi li- 
ful'Creature" laugh and explain that 
until you have a sufTicicni amount of 
pretension concerning Utersiure you 
are an uneducated vermin. 
Until then. I'll just have to fake it.

Reviewer lauds PIT production 



ByMiryTVue 
Guest Writtr 
If you're in the mood for a show 
that's fast-paced, well acted, and with 
plenty of clever dialogue throughout. 
then you'll went to get your tickets to 
"Boys' Life" ploying at PIT through 
March 6. 

Directed by Neil LaBuic. this two 
hour production (no intermission) is 
successful due to good acting by the 
whole cast, a quick pace, and to-thc- 
point dialogue. 

"Boys' Life," written by Howard 
Kordcr. provides us with an intimate 
glimpse of scenes in the lives of three 
men; "ihiriy-ish" best buddies— Jack. 
Don and Phil, We sec how these men 
relate to each other and to the women in 
their lives. They have complciely dif- 
ferent personalities, but, like many real- 
life friendships, they slick together for 
reasons not easily discovered. 

Jack is the sardonic, wise-cracking 
"leader of the pack." His two friends 
usually overlook his shallow. sclTish 
personality and his oftcn-cnicl jokes, , 
because he is cnierlainment for their di- 
rectionless lives, and because, it seems, 
they need attention. 

Don (Carl Olsen) needs Jack- perhaps 
because Jack has a hfc and Don wishes 
he had a life loo. He spends a lot of 
lime at home walking around in his 
underwear. 

Poor Phil (John Brower) is lost. He 
has no idea what to do or what his pur- 
pose Ln life might be. All of his rela- 
tionships with women seem to he 
doomed. Jack has leased and picked on 
Phil all of their lives, until finally, at 
Don's wedding. Jack goes overboard 
wiih his saicasijc cruelly, and Phil tells 
him. "I am sick of you and your miser- 
able, sarcastic bullshiti" Hoorah (or 
Phill I'm sure the rest of the audience 
was as aggravated by Jack's nasty hu- 



mor as I was. It was a relief to see Phil 
show some character and let Jack 
know thai he can't be pushed around 
anymore. 

Jack talks about "die generation that 
had it all but didn't know what lo do 
with it." This sums up the cause of the 
problems these men are facing in their 
lives. You gel die impression they never 
really had to wo* for anything - every- 
thing was given lo them. And so ihey 
now have no sense of values, of self- or 
maturity. They really are still "boys," 

Early on in the show. Jack tells Don 
"We know what we really arc. We're 
men. Don. We do terrible things, let's 
admit wc like them and start from 
there," In the end, Don and Phil realize 
that dicy don't want to be like Jack. 

Jeff Moore, as Jack, carries a lot of 
rapid-fire dialogue without missing a 
beat. He portrays the characier excep- 
tionally well throughout the show. In 
dic'ir secncs togcdier. Jack and Maggie 
"the jogger" (Amber Houston) interact- 
ed like two magnets itiai didn't know 



whether to force each other apart or 
cling logeiher. Their dangerously teas- 
ing dialogue was limited but effective, 

Carl Olsen succeeds Ln playing Don 
as sweet and easygoing, but not a really 
quick-minded fellow, with some won- 
derful dumbfounded facial expressions 

Other than Mary Schrock's over-exag- 
gerated hand-Huitcrirg and rolling eyes 
as Ihe nervous and confused Karen, ii 
was an excellent performance by the 
entire cast. The scene changes were 
well-choreographed, and lighting tran- 
sitions were smoodi and effective. 

An entertaining, adult comedy-drama. 
"Boys' Life" is not suitable for chil- 
dren, so leave the kids widi a sitter and 
bring an open mind. You'll hear some 
foul language and segue music that's a 
little loud; however, plenty of laughs 
and a few insights will be inescapable. 

"Boys' Life" continues Feb. 26. 27. 
and March 5, 6. For ticket informa- 
tion call the PIT box office ai

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. Once a person has 
been infected with HIV, 
how long does it take 
before he or she 
becomes ill? 

A. Symptoms of HIV 
infection may not appear 
for up 10 10 years. The 
health of a person's Immune 
system when exposed to 
HIV greatly influences how 
long he or she will remain 
well. A healthy lifestyle — 
with good diet. rest, 
exercise, reduced stress, no 
drugs, and alcohol only in 
moderation — strengthens 
the immune system.

Gloom ending close at hand 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

FEBRUARY! Forbidding and re- 
IcnilCM i[ weighs down on the human 
spirii. ii grows in each of us maJcing 
ihc whole world seem down -trodden 
and dark. 

February is a month that Testers 
anger and despair in each o( us. It 
sinlis in and then is directed outward 
towards our friends, family, and any- 
one else who happens to gci in the 
way. 

February has only one good aspect 
10 ii: it leads into the month of March 
and into the great season of spring. 

How then in the midst of all this de- 
spair could my mind turn to fancies 
of spring? 

I would like to thank ESPN for thai. 
They brought in the fir^i good news 
of the winter. Baseball's spring train- 
ing has bcgunll I 

And where baseball lies so does 
spring; the sun, the warmth, hot dogs, 
and Wrigley field. 

But baseball is of small concern to 
the more imponant sport that begins 
every spring. Baseball is a mere 
whelp compared to the greatest sport 
ever introduced to mankind. 

Wifflc Ball! Yes. it's time to go out 
and buy the yellow bat and a dozen 
fresh white plastic balls with those 
weird eyedrop shaped holes in them. 
The smell of all that plastic is 
oxhilor^iting. 

It's time 10 pull out the sand paper 
and the electric drill to make those 
balls do the wondrous things they can 
do. A little help can niakc these balls 
do almost anything from fantastic 
curves to sinkers. Not to forget ihc 



most inaedibie pitch of all, the sink- 
ing knuckleball (a pitch I have mas- 
tered to the dismay of any would be 
challengers.) 

In a family of five the game has 
been passed from brother to brother. 
The intense competition slowly en- 
compassed each of my three brothers. 

As my brothers have moved out of 
the area I have been left with the re- 
sponsibility of playing the game. To- 
day my nephew and I have begun the 
competition anew. Each year as he 



The ball's 
in my court 



gets older the game gets more in- 
tense, and more important to our 
mental well being. The question re- 
mains who will be the brat? (Me. of 
course.) 

Unfortunately, the season is short 
and usually lasts imiil wc eiihaust all 
our newly bought wifflc balls (a 
week). Then wifflemania says 
farewell until next year when it will 
be done all over. 

Maybe it's not wiffle ball with your 
family or friends. Maybe the compe- 
tition is difTereni, It could be tradi- 
tional like basketball or softball. It 
could be a non-iradiiional game that 
was made up just by you at a younger 
age. 

It really doesn't matter! The great 
concept about spring and all its un- 
dertones is that it renews our faith in 
life, in each other, and the concept 
that life can be fun. 

I have a theory that spring brings 
out the kid in all of us. Baseball ac- 



cents that! 

We may not watch all the 
of the game, but we keep track. Sta- 
tistics and facts become important, 
not unlike when we were younger 
and we traded baseball cards depend- 
ing on how good the player was to us. 

And no one can deny that going to 
the ballpark to root for your team 
doesn't send an exciting chill down 
your spine not unlike the childhood 



Spring training has begun. Spring is 
almost here. It's time to become one 
with the child that has lam dormant 
throughout most of the year. 

I hope that I'm not the only one 
who touches his or her inner child. 
Maybe I'm weird, who cares, springs 
around the comer and it's lime to say 
good-bye to this horrible February 
funk. 

Springs only a month away so let's 
Stan swinging the bal, the racket, and 
the club and welcome it with open 
arms.
