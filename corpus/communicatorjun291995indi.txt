SAB books VHI's 
'Stand Up Spotlight' star 
Bobby Collins 
to headline Comedy Bash 

by Melissa Young-Flores 
News Editor 

SAD Myers hang in every campus building and the 
organization's chalk art dccorales much of the walk- 
ways. The messages inform students of upcoming 
campus activities, but they do not tell the story of the 
work ii look to book the Comedy Bash or "Forest 
Gump" in the amphitheater. 

"SAB is a branch of student government (IPSGA), 
Wc program events for the entire campus We meet 
weekly," said Elaine Linder, former SAB president 
and current SAD aid. "We do everything from book- 
ing the act with the agent to planning the event, 
advertising, and running the event." 

According to Linder SAB usually has nine or ten 
voting members, but has many non-voting members 
who help organize and advertise SAD events. 

Adrienne Dominguez, SAB Pro Temp, said the 
organization is currenly in a transition period. "We 
don't hav: any goals right now. We're waiting on our 
new director." 

Kimberly Jacobs, formerly employced at the 
University of Illinois at Chicago, will lake Gregory 
Callens' place as director of student activities on 
July 1. 

In the meantime, the group has already booked 
several events for the summer and fall. According to 
Linder. SAD booked VH1 Stand Up Spotlight's 
Bobby Collins for The Comedy Bash. Linder said the 
members are especially proud of the event because it 
was accepted as a Three Rivers Festival event

IPFW Alumni event, and eventually evolved into a 
community affair. 

According lo Hinkle, George Cavanagb, associale 
professor of music, directs the band; however, 
Cavanagb will turn the baton over lo assistant conduc- 
tor Susan Jehl and Indiana Michigan Power mascot 
Louie the Lightining Dug for a number. Children will 
also be asked in help Jehl and Louie, said Hinkle.

Education department faces many changes 



by Megan McArdle

English Does this 

mean Ihe educalion 
department will be seeing a lol of 
changes in the fall? 

Ray Graves, coordinator of counsel- 
ing and advising, said he doesn't think 
so. 

Doth Skelton and English have been 
in education alt their lives and Skellon 
has served in several capacities at IPFW 
since coming here in 1969. 

English is coming lo IPFW from the 
University of Kentucky, Lexingion, 



where he was chair of the department of 
educalion 

Graves said English was ouisianding 
among ihe pool of applicants for the 
position. "He has a national and interna- 
tional reputation in the area of education 
administration. 

"He brings that with him. I think it 
will be good for this institution." 

Marjorie Souers. professor of educa- 
tion, stepped down from the position in 
the spring of 1994. "We did a search for 
the fall, but didn't Find a suitable candi- 
date," Graves said. 

In the meantime Van Coufoudakis, 
vice chancellor of academic affairs, has 
been serving as interim dean. 

Graves said ihe number one responsi- 
bility of the dean is to make sure the area 
needs are satisfied. 

Most teachers who train in an area 
stay in thai area; therefore, as the largest 
university in northeastern Indiana, the 
education departmeni at IPFW is respon- 
sible for making sure the needs of Ihe 
area are mei. 

"The IPFW educalion department has 
seen 25 years of steady increases in pro- 
gramming." Graves said. 



In die future the department will con- 
tinue reacting lo fill the needs of area 
schools, predicted Graves. 

"It is a well-known fact thai special 
educalion is the highest demand area in 
northeastern Indiana. 

"We don't have special education, 
and we need to review lhat," Graves 
said. 

He said the lack of special education 
leachers stems from a lack of special 
educalion certification programs in Ihe 
stale and across the nation. 

Although special education is not 
offered, the main areas of licensure arc 

When students finish Ihcir course- 
work ihey do their student leaching. The 
coordinator of siudcni leaching is 
responsible for placing them in an area 
school, and making sure things go well. 

In the 38 years that Wise has been at 
IPFW. he calculates lhat he has advised 
5,973 students. 

He said, "I think I have helped a lot 
of people, but I am not the right one to 
ask, you'd have lo ask Ihe students." 

According to Wise the new coordina- 
tor will need lo be organized and should 
spend time listening to people. 




Wise 



Wise said of Skellon, "He's a people 
person. There are very few principals in 
northeastern Indiana that I don't know, 
he's ihe same way." 
Wise said 
although he will 
miss the university 
and ihe people here, 
he is looking for- 
ward (o gardening, 
fishing and (ravel- 
ing. 

Skellon said 
he is looking for- 
ward to taking over 
the position. "The transition process 
started in May," 

He said the major change for him will 
be less teaching and more administrative 
duties. 

Although he said he is not planning 
on making any major changes, he said 
he wouldn't hcsiialc lo change if il 
would improve the program. "As always 
we have to take a hard look at our pro- 
grams." 

English will not be on campus until 
July 3 and was unavailable for comment. 



Has time run out on affirmative action? 

The Supreme Court's decision that affirmative action needs to be placed under "strict scrutiny' 
has left many wondering what role affirmative action will now be allowed to play in America.

under "strict scrutiny." 

Adarand Constructors, Inc. filed suit against several 
federal officials churning thai the race-based presumptions 
used in a subcontractor compensation clause violate the 
equal protection component of ihe Fifth Amendment's Due 
Process Clause. 

Juslice Sandra Day O'Connor wrolc in the court's 
majority opinion, "We think thai requiring strict scrutiny is 
ihe best way lo ensure lhat courts will consistently give 
racial qualifications (hat kind of detailed examination, both 
as to ends and as to means." 




"The president wanted all of the affirmative action 
programs reviewed because they have been in place for 30 
years," said White House media represeniative Peggy 
Lewis. "The president is in support of affirmative action." 

Ihe president's review has noi yet been completed, but 
according lo Lewis should be done in the near future. Lewis 
said there is some delay due to the Supreme Court's ruling 
because ihe president warns lo ensure the review is in 
compliance with ihe ruling. 

According lo Middleton, quotas and affirmative action 
are noi one and ihe same and never have been, but the iwo

courts, thus leaving a tremendous gray area in affirmative 
action programs. 

"At this point in time there have been no discussions on 
our campus or at Ihe oiher two siles of changing our 
affirmative action program," said Donna Middleton, 
Affirmative Action/EEO Officer. 

Middleton said affirmative action was not eliminated, 
bui is in unsettled territory. 

"The ruling actually did not strike down any affirmative 
action programs. It did criticize the moral justification of 
the program. Il certainly has put affirmative action 
programs in a tender footing," said Middleton. 

According lo Middleton, directors of affirmative action 



IPFW's policy on affirmative action is governed by an 
executive memorandum issued by Purdue University 
President Steven C. Deering on August 1, 1993, 

The memorandum defines the University's statement of 
principles and values, policy and designates a chair of 
aulhoriiyandaccountability. 

Bcering declared himself accouniable "with the overall 
responsibility for the successful implementation of Purdue 
University's equal employment opportunity and affirmative 
action policies." 

Middleton said it will take more case law lo completely 
define what affirmative action is now supposed to be. but in

IPFW welcomes freshmen with open arms 




by Melissa Young-Flores 
News Editor 

Alihough the first day of col- 
lege seems like the adventure of a 
lifetime, the first few hours can be 
gut-wrenching torture for new stu- 
dents. 

By ihe lime they find a parking 
space, figure out which building is 
Kettler. find the correct room, and 
lake a seat, they are sweating bul- 
lets and wondering. "Am I in the 
right class?" 

Luckily thousands have preced- 
ed ihe incoming freshmen and can 
empathize The orientation com- 
mittee, along with faculty and stu- 
dent organizations, will join 
together to give the new 
Mastodons a head siari on the 
upcoming semester. 

"The goal of SOAR is lo orien- 
tate freshman; to give ihem the 
information Ihey need to succeed," 
said Marian Zimmerman, dean of 
students 

According to Ihe orientation 



committee chairperson Carl 
Zimmerman, SOAR is directed 
toward traditional students. "The 
purpose of SOAR is lo orientate 
new students of a traditional age, 
directly out of high school within 
Iwo years." 

Departments from all over 
campus, as well as student organi- 
zations, will join together begin- 
ning July 7 and continuing into the 
following week until the 13. to 
welcome the new freshmen. 

Booths and tables will be set up 
in and around Walb in order lo 
inform freshmen and their parents 
about the opportunities available at 
IPFW. 

"Our goal is lo have a lot more 
involvement on campus with 
BCC, so we can be more visible." 
Black Collegian Caucus (BCC) 
former presideni Yveite Williams 
said. 

Willams said it is hard for new 
students lo know aboul all of ihe 
programs available lo ihem with- 
out some guidance. "If you don't 



hear about il or see it, you don't 
know what lo do." 

According to Williams, BCC 
will host a summer picnic for 
prospective members sometime in 
August or September, and already 
has a Musical Fest and Heritage 
Bowl planned for later in the year. 

Director of Ihe Center for 
Women and Returning Adults 
Catherine Hansman-Fcrguson 
agrees wilh Williams. 

"Our department's goal is lo 
meet and greet incoming fresh- 
men, and lo let them know that we 
have a center for women and 
reluming adults," said Hansman 
Ferguson. 

Hansman-Ferguson said ihe 
department would especially like 
to reach young women and inform 
them that there are women's orga- 
nizations on campus as well as 
classes about women's issues.

res Edltoi 



Change is a loi like death; you can be certain 
lhai il is going to happen. This is Hue wiih the 
Hclmkc Library. The Dewey Decimal Sysicm lhai 
we all learned in grade school no longer applies. 
Thankfully we have a siaff ai ihc campus library 
thai are willing and have been extensively trained 
10 help. Bui there arc things thai we as studenls 
can do to minimize our lime spent in the library, 
Judy Violate. assLstanl director, offers a few tips 
lo help us get the right materials needed. 



/. ASK. NOMATTER WHAT' 
Dumb questions do not wist. If you are in doubt, check it out. The library workers have the answers 
you need to know, so don't be afraid to ask the question. 

2. BRING YOUR ASSIGNMENT' 

This is simple common sense. The workers can help you find enacUy whal you need if you both can 
see it on paper. You may not understand the assignment, so it is a good idea to have someone else 
read the assignment to interpret what your professor has in mind. 

3. THINK AHEAD OF TIME' 

If you spend a little time thinking about what you may need, the worker can help you find il faster. 
Having a notion is a true head start 

4. START IMMEDIATELY! 

You may need to have things sent from another library. This can lake a considerable amount of your 
valuable time. The sooner you start tbc more quality your work will possess. 

** Remember, the library staff is willing to assist you in any way they can. Use them 
Don't let embarrassment keep you from getting the materials you need.

International 
Village 

A chance to taste the world 

by Paul Tupper 
Features Editor 

One of Fort Wayne's finest 
qualities is the ethnicity of the 
restaurants. If you are bored with 
the typical Hoosicr haute cuisine, 
then there are plenty of options, 
and not just Mexican and Chinese 
foods. Wc also have the grand 
options of choosing Russian, Thai, 
or Greek food. But if you arc hop- 
ing to view many different foods 
side by side before deciding, then 
you will surely want lo investigate 
the International Village as pan of 
the Three Rivers Festival. 

The admission is free and the 
prices are reported to be reason- 
able. You will be able lo try foods 
from Africa, Germany, Poland, 
Scandinavia and the Philippines, 
just to name a few of the participat- 
ing countries. 

This event has many things 
going for it. One is thai it Is totally 
accessible to ihose who are physi- 
cally challenged or need assisiance. 
Il has ben my experience lhai 
some of the other events of the past 
festivals, Three Rivers or others, 
have not been handicapped accessi- 
ble. Let's hope all other public 
events take tbc lead of the 
International Village. 

This is also a child friendly 
gathering. Wednesday, July 12 is 
set aside as "Kids Day." Free ice 
cream will be handed oui between 
of 2 and 4 p.m. And with senior 
citizen discounts available daily 
from 1:30 lo4 p.m., the entire fam- 
ily can participate. 

As if that were not enough, 
entertainment is being provided. 
Plus this all takes place in the air- 
conditioned comfort of the Scottish 
Rite Ballroom. 

The lniemational Village will 
last only five days during the festi- 
val, from July 10 through 14. Food 
will be served from 1 lajn.to 8 p.m.

The Balsaga continues in 
"Batman Forever," with Val 
Kilmer taking over as the 
caped crusader. This third 
installment is jam packed with 
action and even some comedy. 
But it may be a bit too much. 

Like the last one, "Batman 
Returns," there are two villains 
to fight. This time it's Jim 
Carrey's Riddlcr and Tommy 
Lee Jones' Two Face. While 
everyone else is cooing over 
Carrey's performance, I would 
like to pay some attention lo 
Hie actor's acior, Jones. While 
Carrey Is good, he is in his ele- 
ment. Jones is not, and he plays 
Two Face like a larger than life 
cartoon character, true to comic 
book form. 

Bui Batman must also make 
room for his love life. Hence 
the presence of Nicole Kidman. 
She plays a psychologist who 
finds the man inside of Batman 
inicresting enough io study. Of 
course Baiman warns her too, 
but as Bruce Wayne. I am not 
revealing too much when I tell 
you thai he eventually geis his 
wish. 

As if that were noi enough, 
Batman takes in a suddenly 
-Oiphaned-Diclt -Greys on, who 
discovers what his roommate, 



him. This 
strong 



t and warns lo Join 
one of the movie's 
points. Joel 
Schuemacher. the film's direc- 
tor, does a great job of explain- 
ing (he circumstances that 
brings these iwo very similar 
men logeihcr. There is also a 
great scene in which Bruce 
tries io tell Dick that being a 
superhero is hard to do and 
hard to get out of. But Dick is 
determined and joins Batman 
anyway. 

The script also shows a 
more human Batman. And a 
more human Bruce Wayne. 
Fans may not want to see their 
hero having doubts, but it does 
expand the depths of the per- 
son we have sat through three 
movies to get to know. 

But it is all loo much. Two 
Face deserves his own movie 
where he can really reek havoc. 
At this pace, the Baiman fran- 
chise will run out of villains 
before the viewers have had 
their fill of Batman movies. If 
there was one less bad guy in 
"Forever," we might have seen 
a more in-depth training of 
Robin. 

Credil must go to. Kilmer for 
making both Batman and 
Bruce Wayne a likable person, 
not just a figure used to fight 
crime and save the day. In fact, 
all of the actors have done 



excellent jobs with their roles. 
Even the hookers, played by 
the members of En Vogue, 
who first gTcet Dick when he is 
cruising in the Batmobile. 

"Batman Forever" is 3 fun 
ride. Let's hope that this trend 
continues. Ii has me longing 
for more sequels.

Michael Jackson 



by PaulTupper 
Feature* Editor 

Call mc picky. Bui when I sec an 
artist has added new songs to a 
greatest hits album. 1 expect each of 
those songs to live up to the stan- 
dards of the other cuts that deserve 
to be called hits Of the many recent 
hit collections of the nineties, only 
Madonna and Bryan Adams have 
included songs on their collections 
that have all in fact become hits of 
their own. 

'"HlStory: Past. Present and 
Future Book 1" by Michael Jackson 
has fifteen new songs. But since he 
added "Future" to the title, and 
never uses the word "hits," then I 
guess I can overtook this. But this is 
just one of many flaws I have found 
on this ovcrzealous masterpiece. 

Even before "Dangerous," 
Jackson's last album, he has been 
pressured to release a hits collec- 
tion. He should have waited. Not 
that he doesn't have enough hits to 



Till a greatest collection, but the sec- 
ond disc, the "Future" part of 
"HlStory," is a fine album on its 
own. The "Past" part of this two 
disc set is not really needed. If 
Jackson wanted to make a come- 
back, then the new fifteen songs 
would have been enough. This 
brings mc to my first major gripe. 

The fifteen classic songs includ- 
ed here arc not enough. Missing arc 
such great tunes as "P.Y.T. (Pretty 
Young Thing)," "Human Nature," 
"Say, Say, Say" (with Paul 
McCartney). "Dirty Diana," 
"Smooth Criminal." "In The 
Closet," "Jam," and "Will You Be 
There," just to name a few, I also 
find it disappointing that "Ben" was 
not included. A belter, more com- 
plete collection of his work would 
have been adequate for a double 
hits album. 

But instead, we have just fifteen 
hits that are used to gel us to listen 
io the stuff, almost all of which per- 
lain to his child molestation allega- 



tions and his "victimization" by the 
media that he has so masterfully 
manipulated. Which introduces my 
second complaint. 

Whether you think he may have 
harmed children, the fact is that the 
investigators did not find any evi- 
dence against him; therefore, he is 
innocent. I don't think the world 
needs nearly an entire album of 
songs saying he is innocent. But I 
guess if we warned to. we could 
consider this Jackson's first concept 
album. 

The music of the second disc is 
in itself a marvelous piece of work. 
This really is Jackson at his finest. 
The disc starts off with "Scream," 
the powerful duet with his sister 
Janet. Not any other song could 
have described their relationship 
with each other, and the media. This 
trend continues with "They Don't 
Care About Us," "This Time 
Around," and "D.S.," a brave lash- 
whipping to Dom Sheldon, the man 
who headed the investigation 



against Jackson. 

If I were to pick out my favorite 
of ihe "response songs" it would 
have to be "Tabloid Junkie." 
Produced by Janet's team of Jimmy 
Jam and Terry Lewis, this song 
deals with how many of the rag 
papers tend to falsely report a 
celebrities sexuality. It's very frank 
and honest look at someone who, 
although married, still raises ques- 
tions about his love life. 

The ride is pretty smooth and 
clear, with songs about the usual 
Jackson repertoire, ranging from 
loneliness and the environment. But 
then, you may find a spcedbump. 
Jackson has, for whaicver reason. 
decided to remake the Beatles clas- 
sic "Come Together." I guess we 
should be thankful that he didn't 
jump on the trend of remaking 
"Yesterday." 

Jackson for the most part uses 
his groggy voice to express butch- 
ness But that can gel very sweet, 
with the notable standouts of "You 
Are Not Alone" and "Childhood." 
Given the room. Jackson can reach 
amazing heights. 

But there are more problems 
involving the packaging of 
"HlStory." Jackson dedicates this 
project "to all my children of the 
world." yet this album contains a 



few expletives, one of which would 
give a movie an R rating if used. 
Not only does this album not have a 
warning sticker on the cover, but it 
does not warn the parents of ihe 
children who may be buying ibis 
album. 

Secondly, this album contains 
printed lyrics to only some of the 
new songs, not alt. This seems 
inconsistent. Why only print some 
of the songs lyrics and not the oth- 
ers? If Jackson would sing in a clear 
voice, then they wouldn't be needed 
to understand what he desperately 
wants to say. 

Thirdly, if you thumb through 
ihe photo book, you will sec multi- 
ple pictures of people holding up 
signs that call Jackson the "King of 
Pop." Bruce Springsteen doesn't 
use his nickname of "The Boss" to 
promote himself. The same goes for 
the "Queen of Soul" Aretha 
Franklin. It's not that Jackson isn't 
the King of Pop. but should he real- 
ty flaunt it? 

The bottom line is this: 
"HlStory" should have been broken 
down into two separate works, 
released about a year apart from 
each other But what has arrived in 
stores is a testimony of true latent. 
The first disc rates at a 9 out of 10, 
with the second disc deserving an 8.

Soul Asylum 



by Nol T. Beckley 
Managing Editor 

Just when you thought it was 
safe to listen to the radio without 
the thrcal of hearing Soul Asylum's 
"Runaway Train," Dave Pimer and 
the rest of the Minneapolis quartet 
released their newest CD, "Let 
Your Dim Light Shine." 

Although I doubt any single on 



this CD will be a mega-hit, it still is 
a strong release. As always Pimer's 
lyrics feature his incomparable abil- 
ity to rhyme. The lyrics also feature 
more of a tongue-in-cheek approach 
to the songs than "Grave Dancers 
Union." For example, in ihe cut 
"String of Pearls" Pimer sings, "his 
wife took the train to her ex-lover's 
funeral/who died in the 
bathroom/hit his head on a urinal." 



Urinal and funeral is incredibly dif- 
ficult to rhyme. 

By glancing at the song titles, 
one might assume this is an ordi- 
nary, angry, and dismal sounding 
release by another grunge band. 
Nothing could be further from the 
truth. Despite the song titles of 
"Misery," "To my own Devices" 
and "Promises Broken," the lyrics 
have an almost whimsical quality to 
[hem. One cut speaks of a Siamese 
twin who becomes president. 
Another talks about a waitress who 



wailed on Elvis. 

Pimer somehow manages to con- 
ceal many serious thoughts within 
every song. Nothing as blatant as 
"Runaway Train," but pretty solid 
just the same. He shows a maturity 
in his writing with a biting sense of 
humor and he never lakes himself 
too seriously. 

To classify this CD would not be 
fair to Soul Asylum. There are loo 
many influences and loo many dif- 
ferent sounds which make up this 
release. The band has moved away 



from Iheir earlier punk rock sound 
even though bands like Rancid and 
Green Day have capitalized on the 
punk revival.

Scrap affirmative action; 
create new remedy 



Hopefully we have seen ihc lasi 
of Affirmative Aciion afier fhe 
recent Supreme Coun decision, For 
30 years, American business has 
been forced to hire people not only 
on their qualifications but also their 
race, creed or sex. Affirmative 
Aciion never won ihc discrimina- 
tion war on either the race front or 
ihc sen front. Today's society no 
longer needs Affirmative Action to 
force ethnic change in the work- 
force. 

Both Affirmative Action and the 
Civil Rights Acts did produce many 
changes which were beneficial to 
socieiy in the past Black and 
Hispanic police officers, teachers, 
etc. are fairly common today, but 
30 years ago, minorities were "kept 
in their place." 

But what would a world without 
Affirmative Aciion hold for non- 
Caucasians? America may sec a 
return to the exclusionary practices 
of ihc recent past. Wu doubl any- 
thing such as a grandfather clause 
or a new Jim Crow law will be leg- 
islated, but we are concerned indi- 
vidual personnel practices. And let 
us not forget that Ihe 1964 Civil 
Rights Aci is still in place to pre- 
vent employment discrimination. If 



Affirmative Aciion is dissolved, 
wbai will replace this outdated 
practice? Even ihe Republican hier- 
archy is not so naive to believe thai 
the world would be perfect as soon 
as Affirmative Action is ended. 

What Affirmative Aciion 
attempted to do is create a good of 
boy network to mirror ihe one cre- 
alcd by while society. A valiant 
attempt which failed to do what was 
wanted. There were some positive 
results, and America should be 
grateful for ibis process, bul ihe 
time has come to attempt a new 
remedy for the ailments which have 
plagued this land for 400 years. 

Mosi students ai IPFW are under 
30 and have nothing lo compare 
Affirmative Aciion against. With 
all ihc great minds on both sides of 
ihc color line, one of those great 
minds ought to have a remedy for 
ihe inefficient methods of 
Affirmaiivc Action. 

We cannot forget ihe past, even 
if some people would like to revise 
history and say racism does not 
exist. Do not forget George 
Orwell's words. "Who controls the 
past controls the future; who con- 
trols ihe present controls the past" 



Commentary 



Clinton loses support 




issue, I understood. He had a lot of 
pressures from a loi of different 
sides wanting him to make a deci- 
sion. Of course we all know that he 
made ihc wrong decision, but we 
need lo understand how hard it was 
for him lo come up with it_ 

Bul 1 can no longer defend him. 
He has made too many mistakes for 
me lo forgive. 

First came the dismissal of 
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, 
for suggesting that if masturbalion 
was taught in primary schooling, 
lhat we might have less teen preg- 
nancies and sexually transmitted 
diseases. I felt she had a valid point 
and had ihc best intentions of our 
country at heart. Yet Clinton fired 
her as an answer to angry' liberals 
who would rather let their children 
learn about masturbation from their 
best friends during sleep-overs than 
in a classroom. 

Then came the joini decision by 
Clinton and Attorney General Janet 
Reno to stand clear of adding iheir 
views lo Colorado Amendment 2, 
which would ban all gay rights 
laws that individual cities may have 
passed. First, Clinton was supposed 
to be our pal. Gays elected him 
because he was full of promise of a 
better life for gays. Second, Reno is 
a middle-aged woman who has 
never been married and has short 
hair 1 think it's rather hypocritical 
for her lo not support gay rigbls. 

But the lasi straw came most 
recently when some elected offi- 



cials, who happen lo be openly gay, 
were invited to the White House, 
only to be greeted by securiiy 
guards wearing rubber gloves to 
protect themselves from any risk of 
contacting the HIV virus. This real- 
ly bites. No other group has been 
grecied this way. Naturally, ihe gay 
officials were offended and 
demanded an apology, which at the 
lime of this writing, Clinton has yet 
to offer. 

Gays and straights have worked 
hard for over a decade to educate 
everyone in this country on HIV. 
AIDS, and what causes them. The 
rest of the country knows that it is 
not possible lo contact ihe disease 
by casual contact, so why don't 
these guards know ii? Clinton owes 
il lo every person who has contact- 
ed the fatal disease, and to their 
families, to see to ii thai this gov- 
ernment workers are immediately 
educated on HIV and AIDS. He 
musl then apologize for this dis- 
grace bis staff has caused. 

But until he does so, I have a lit- 
tle message lo President Clinton. I 
have always, and wilt always sup- 
port the Democratic ticket. But for 
you to gain my vote during re-elec- 
tion, you had better get a spine. 
Here in ihe Midwest, we have a 
word to people like you... cop-out. 
We have another word for people 
like you... wussy. In faci, I can 
ihink of many words we would 
used lo describe someone who is 
doing what you are doing; sellout, 
liar, and yellow-belly just to list a 
few. 

Remember who elected you, 
Clinton. For it is ihe people of this 
country who pay you, and ii is ihe 
people of this country that you 
work for. Forget about us, and you 
may just find yourself without a 
job, or worst yet, without any 
friends. Ii gets really lonely at the 
bottom.

GOOD LUCK THERE,

Watch out for those vipers 



by F. Lane Douse 
Guest Columnist 

When I was asked by a 
Communicator staff member to 
write again. I was somewhat hesi- 
tant. 1 really didn'l know if I was 
ready to take the risk of becoming 
a while mouse running inside of a 
laboratory of education striving lo 
attain self-realization only to find a 
viper waiting ai the end of the cor- 
ridor. The viper protects the door 
of life and stands ready lo constrict 
the transmission of any new and 
diverse ideas which challenge ihc 
foundation of the status quo. 

Last December when the fall 
editor and managing editor of the 
Communicator resigned (contrary 
to the rumor lhat they were fired), I 
fell as if the voices of truth had 
vanished from this campus. Then 
when I was involuntarily removed 
as advertising manager last spring 
for no apparent reason olhcr loan 
the usual political bullshit lhat 
exists within any organization, I 
knew the voice of truth had van- 
ished from the face of this campus. 
That's when I realized I had 
broken one of the rules of racial 
standing. According to Derrick 
Bell, author of one my favorite 
books, "Faces at the Bottom of the 
Well: The Permanence of Racism," 
ihe fourth rule slates: 

"When a black person or group 
[or anyone who supports black 
folk] makes a statement or lakes an 
action thai the white community or 
vocal components thereof deem 
"ouirageous," ihe laiter will active- 
ly recruit blacks willing lo refute 
the slatement or condemn the 
action. Blacks who respond to ihe 
call for condemnation will receive 
superstanding status. Those blacks 
[and their supporters] who refuse 
lo be recruited will be interpreted 
as endorsing the statements and 
actions and may suffer political or 
economical reprisals." 

And once an African-American 
breaks a rule of racial standing, be 
or she can count on condemnation, 
especially if one is in the media. 

It's Iruly amazing how people 
spout rhetoric aboul this country 
being a democracy and that every- 
one has the right to due process, 
unless you challenge the status quo 
or ihe people who are in charge. 
All of the sudden justice becomes 
"just us." 

People play Iheir political 
games, casting imperfect illusions 
to disperse iheir so-called biases, 
but fail to realize that victims, like 
African-Americans, have been

inhcrendy trained to identify ihem. 
Therefore, their false illusions 
become indicators of their true 
biased feelings. 

If an individual has the knowl- 
edge and capability to stop some- 
one from intentionally damaging 
another person (because of their 
own personal demons) and doesn't, 
this person has committed the mosi 
heinous crime against society 
ilself; he or she no longer pre- 
scribes to his or her conscience. 
These people have bankrupted iheir 
soul because they have allowed 
power, greed and cowardice to take 
control. 

It's easier lo become a snake 
than to fight for one's principles. 
Most people who fight for what is 
right, whether it deals with sexual 
orientation, ethnic background and 
gender, lend to stand alone. Ever 
since being transplanted lo this 
country, standing alone has been a 
longstanding tradition of my ethnic 
group and I have no problem stand- 
ing or falling alone. 

If ihere aren't any principles 
worth fighting for. than why even 
exist? To slab other people in the 
back with one's venomous tongue? 

Don't we all have the responsi- 
bility to do what is morally and 
ethically right for ihe people 
around us or is lhat loo human? 

Imagine if people, in general, 
would just exist in this world as 
themselves and not sell iheir souls 
lo power and greed; just think how 
perfect things could be. But as I am 
always reminded, this is not a per- 
fect world; it's reality. 

And the reality is some people 
are just snakes supplying ihe ven- 
omous words and actions that con- 
tinue to decay society as we know 
it. 

One can only hope and pray lhat 
a little shred of what used lo be 
iheir conscience still exists within 
their minds. Maybe ihen ihese peo- 
ple can have a chance to make that 
change. Like Anne Frank. I loo 
believe there is still some piece of 
goodness in everyone; too bad you 
have to go through a lot of shit to 
find it

Crown air fresheners: 
Fad or alien plot? 




I've 98.9 and 103.9. These Iwo stations 
been silent arc, sadly, the best in town, 
although 1 know they musi be vio- 
lating some sort of FCC regulation 
on the number of Ted Nugent songs 
you can play per 24 hours. 

One lime I ventured oui into that 
mad. howling wilderness beyond 
the relative safely of 98.9 and 
103.9. There a thousand radio tow- 
ers of Babel were broadcasting 
Happy Birthday sung by cals, live 
readings of Louis Lamour novels, 
squelchy Paul Harvey monologues, 
and other horrors thai would have 
killed a lesser man. I swear to this 
day that hanowing journey some- 
how stunted my growth, leaving me 
a quarter inch shorter than Ihe 
national average. Sure, I could 
sue — but how could money ease 
my torment? 

I think there's some kind of con- 
nection between all this madness. 
According lo some of the militia 
leaders who testified before con- 
gress lasi week, the government 
somehow created all the tornadoes 
and floods lhat have recently rav- 
aged the Midwest. My theory is 
that some nefarious NASA saiellite 
crcaies all those tornadoes, broad- 
casts Ted Nugenl songs, relays 
alien mind control transmissions, 
and probably fired the 'magic bul- 
let' that killed Kennedy. And 
everyone knows that NASA is only 
an acronym for femiNisis, Ihe 
mediA elite, homosexuals, And 
sbriners. Undoubtedly, some 
lunatic fringe cull, such as the 
Catholic Church, bankrolled this 
sinister operation. 

Until I can get a federal grant to 
study this phenomenon, however, 
the remaining free people of ihe 
world should probably panic.

The fact that they have gained in

Editor-in-chief 

Boating is a popular pastime for 
kid* and adults alike. Recently the 
Indiana legislature passed a series of 
boating laws that will affect any and 
all boaters in the state of Indiana. 

These lawi clarify the way per- 
sonal waiercraft should be used, raise 
the minimum age for boating and 
require points on the boater's drivers 
license if he or she is driving intoxi- 
cated. 

According to Scott Charters, 
Indiana conservation officer and pub- 
lic information officer, a committee 
was formed last year to look into the 

Senator Mccks introduced a bill 
into the Senate that clarified and 
changed many of the current laws. 
Some of those changes went into 

effect immediately, others went into 
effect on July 1, and the last changes 
will go into effect Jan. 1, 

Charters said, under the new law, 
drinking and boating will be treated 
the same as drinking and driving. If a 
person's drivers license is suspended 
ihcy are also suspended from boating. 

If tbey are caught drinking and 
boating they will get points and the 
offense will be treated the same as if 



they were driving a car. 

However, there is no open con- 
tainer law for boats, therefore, a per- 
son could drink in a boat, or while 
driving a boat. Charters laid this is 
not advised. "If you make a mistake 
on the water it is not forgiving If you 
fall you could be falling off of the 




boat and end up at the bottom of the 
lake." 

Several new laws concern person- 
al waiercraft such as Jet Skis and 
Wave Runners. According to 
Charters, the new laws spell out what 
people can and cannot do with per- 
sonal waiercraft and should be easier 
to understand than the old laws. 

Specifically, it is illegal to drive 
facing backwards, tow an individual 
unless the waiercraft is at least 10 
feet long, seats 3 people and someone 
acts as an observer and ride, operate 
or be towed without wearing a life 

The law also covers the shut-off 
device, and the way the personal 
waiercraft is driven. 



Charters suggested thai owners 
and operators of personal waiercraft 
gel a copy of these law* and review

Starting Ian 1 the following puis 
of the legislation will go into effect:

only be able lo operate a boat with 
less than a 10 hp motor. 

• Those who arc 15 or older and 
have taken a boater education course 
and have an Indiana identification 
card may operate all boats. 

Charters said some kids will lose

course this summer, and are able to 
drive, but won't be able to drive next 



He said he wouldn't be surprised 
if a boating endorsement was added 
lo Indiana drivers licenses the same 
way the motorcycle endorsement 
was.

course," Charters said. 'That might 
happen if wc had a series of accidents

CM Building gets new air handling system 



We provide alternatives to abortion. 

24-hour phone • 422-3544 




Chairs and furniture have been covered and 
moved In the CM building because of renovatioi 
by Megan McArdk 
Editor-in-Chief 

Anyone who has been in ihc 
Classroom-Medical Building has 
noticed the "Caulion • work in 
progress" signs posted at every 



physical plant, 
said the work 
in progress is 
^Za** actually a 
"major modifi- 
cation lo the air 
handling and 
distribulion systems." 

In other words, they are going lo 
improve the circulation and 
turnover of the air in the building. 

Kaiier said this will be done by 
taking the third floor off of the cur- 
rent system and adding a new air 



handler for that floor, by enlarging 
the air ducts and changing from gas 
fired lo hot water heat. 

The construction is scheduled lo 
be compieicd before the start of 
classes next semester and is current- 
ly ahead of schedule 

The building was built in the 
1970s ai a lime when the govern- 
ment mandated that energy efficient 
buildings be constructed. Katlcr 
said. "It wasn't a sick building, but 
il wasn't a healthy building either " 

Kaiter said the new system will 
return a lot more air from the spaces 
in the building back 10 the air han- 
dling unit. 

In addition each individual space 
will have hot water supply return 
piping installed. 

With the old system the thermo- 
stat could only lei more cold air inio 
the room if il was too warm. 

Kattcr said, "With the new sys- 
tem we ought to be able to keep it 
warm in the winter and keep 
enough air circulating in the after- 
noons so that students won't gel 
drowsy." 

According to Jeannelte Clausen, 
associate professor of German, fac- 
ulty who work in the building are 
happy about the changes. "We want 
to be able lo breathe." 

Clausen said although she wants 
the new air system, ihe construction 
has been very disruptive. "I want 
the renovations to be done." 

Clausen opted to move to a dif- 
ferent office in the building while 



construction was going on in her 
office instead of moving to another 
office for the enure summer. 

She said even though she never 
left the building, students have had 
problems (racking her down. 

Many professors and depart- 
ment have moved to other build- 
ings. Even if iheir offices have 
moved. Kaiter said Ihe phones are 
being forwarded and faculty and 
staff are slill reachable. 

Before going to visit anyone in 
CM. students should find out if 
their professors' office has moved.

■ SOAR from page 6 
The athletics department will also 
be in attendance at this year's 
SOAR "Our goal especially this 
year is to make sure that students 
are aware that we do a great deal of 
programming with their dollars." 
Assistant Facitiiy Manager Tish 
Tipping said. 

According to Tipping, the depart- 
ment would like to stress to the new 
Mastodons that recreation is an 
important part of wellness and a 
greai way to meet new friends- 
Tipping said the athletics depart- 
ment is the largest student employer 
on campus and will be accepting 
applications ai SOAR. Close to 
2000 students and parents are 
expected to attend, according to C. 
Zimmerman. 



ing, photography, sculpture and 
computer design. 

Christina Kulow, director of 
public relations and development 
for die shcool of fine and perform- 
ing arts, said professors for the 
foundations courses pick their stu- 
dents best works and submit them 
for exhibition. 

Russell Oeucl, professor of fine 
arts, is in charge of setting up the 
exhibit. 

On display are paintings, draw- 
ings, collages and sculptures in var- 
ious media. 

Kulow said many students have 



never shown their work before, and 
might not be able to if it weren't for 
this show. 

Every summer the previous 
year's work is displayed. In the fall 
the show will be taken down and 
replaced with another exhibit. 

Oettel is in charge of scheduling, 
which is usually doneup to a year 
in advance. 

Kulow said the fall exhibits are 
usually guest artists. "Our faculty 
makes recommendations of artists 
who would be good role models for 
the students."
