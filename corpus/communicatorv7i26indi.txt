His letter on page 2 points out 
that disgust, self-righteousness, 
hate and other reactions toward 
gays makes one question whether 
or not honesty really is the root of

Background music it ain't. 

Nine brutally frank drivers with Hat power radiation take you

There's no sound like it in the world. On any other speaker. At 
any price. 

Seventeen years in the making, these radical radials with their 
own room equalizers take you beyond sound. Right to the full 
force of the composer's inspiration. To the sound the artist/eft, as
