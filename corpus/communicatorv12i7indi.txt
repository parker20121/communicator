Offenders: A new breed 



October?, 1980 



Youth crime abounds in Fort Wayne 



Communicalor reporter Robert 
Rinearson presents a portrait of youth 
crime in for) Wayne as seen Trom the 
perspective of (he offenders, police and 
psychologists in a three-part scries that 
begins today. 

In Ihe early morning hours, a drunk 
emerges from a bar on Fairfield 
Avenue. Immtidiately. five youths 
approach and surround the confused 
man, striking up an innocent con- 
versation. Without warning, the boys 
start searching his pockets for money 
or anything of worth. As the drunk 
resists, the youths knock him down 
from behind and kick him unconscious. 
With the man's wristwatch, wedding 
ring and wallet, the young boys make 
their escape into the night. 

This scene involving youth crime is 
not an uncommon occurence in Fort 
Wayne. One of the boys involved is 
John, age 16, John's other crimes in- 
clude car theft, shoplifting and a house 
burglary that netted him H.OOO worth of 
handguns. John also claims to have 
made $6,000 in just three days from 
theft and burglaries. 

Another youth, Kevin, is a Fort 
Wayne resident who's currently doing 
time at the Indiana Boys School. II is 
his second lime at Ihe correctional 
center; lie has already spent two years 
in other detention facilities. "I can't 
help but steal," he said. "If I see 
something I want, I take it. I don't care 
whose it is." 

Without emolion, Kevin goes on to 



"I was always arguing with my mother, and I never had an old 
man to kick my ass when I smarted off, so I usually got away with 
most of my pranks. " Kevin, teenage thief. 



describe his life. "I was in and out of 
school, and even when I was in school 1 
was usually drunk or high." He em- 
phasized his love for whiskey. 

"1 was always arguing with my 
mother, and I nevephad an old man to 
kick my ass when 1 smarted off. so I 
usually got away with most of my 
pranks," he continued, "The last time I 
was arrested, it was for harassment of 
school Officials, which at Ihe lime. I was 
carrying a knife. The other charge was 
vehicle theft." 

Kevin didn't believe he would ever go 
back to school. But he did stress his 
belief that crime certainly DOES pay. 

As another boy put it. "Why should I 
make $180 a week working in some 
greasy-spoon restaurant, when I can 
make SBOO a week doing crime and have 
a good lime?" "How about that," he 
said with a knowing stare, "it rhymes." 

Talking to the new breed of offender, 
one becomes increasingly aware thai 
penny ante misdemeanors are no 
longer satisfactory, nor do they pay 
enough. Arrest records for 1979 show 
Ihal in Allen County, youths accounted 
for 24'! arrests for burglary, B09 for 
theft, 130 for assault (including 2 for 
murder ) and 23 for eex crimes. 

Perhaps the most frightening aspect 
of youth crime is the growing in- 
volvement of violence. As one juvenile 
probation officer said, "It's not unusual 



s person or lucked away in 



anymore to go to a teenage party where 
at least one of the kids will have a gun, 
either on hi 
the car " 

Gilbert, t7. was last arrested for gun 
theft. He says he sold the guns mostly to 
pimps. 

"There's a lol of money to be made 
selling guns. I had "every kind 
— mangums. 45's, 38's. I could clear 
about $120 a gun. I never went out to a 
parly without my own gun on me. and 
when any of my buddies pulled a rob- 
bery, they always carried a 
gun— sometimes a sawed-off shotgun." 

Kenny, age 17, said he netted 
anywhere from $100 to $1200 for each 
armed robbery Ihal he's pulled. He 
explained Ihal with two comrades, he 
mostly robbed Seven-Eleven Stores or 
gas stations. 

"Sometimes we'd pick up a hitch- 
hiker, beat Ihe hell out of him or her. 
then lake whatever they had," he said. 
"Anolher gimmick is to send our. 
girlfriends into boutiques lo steal 
clolhes or jewels.". 

Kenny went on lo tell how his brother. 
only two years older than he. was 
already pimping. 

Almost 90 percent of Ihe offenders 



interviewed admittetl that at the time of 
any crime they committed, they either 
had been drinking or were on some 
form of intoxicant. 

"I'd do some acid, but mostly 1 would 
drink," said Kevin. "In fact, I can 
remember whole weeks when I was 
never straight." 

.Bob, 15, focuses his attention on 
selling drugs, "I've sold ten Ian 
hallucinogenic), grass, and LSD. I've 
dealt a little in coke. I got most of my 
supplies from guys a lot older than 
myself," he said. "Hey, Fort Wayne is 
good to me. ' ' 

Bob does most of his dealing in the 
southwest district along Broadway. 
"I've even sold to the girls in Ihe 
inas_sage parlors, usually out the back 
door, "he said. 

During Ihe conversation, Bob refused 
to discuss why he'd been charged with 
comspiracy to commit murder only a 
year before. The charge was laler 
dropped. 

What Bob would talk about "was his 
feelings toward Ihe Fort Wayne police. 
"They're crap." he said, "always 
trying to screw wilh your head. I've 
even sold drugs locops al parties," 

But Bob wouldn't give names. "I've 
got lo go back lo the streets." he ex- 
plained, "I'm not stupid." 

In general, Ihe police have their side 
of the story. 




Graphic by Bob Lang 



Lieutenant Ralph West of the county 
vice and narcotics squad explained Ihe 
problems Ihe police face. "II takes as 
much time and money lo bust a 16-year- 
old as it does an adult," West said 
"And then the courts, if they don'l led 



Ihe kid out on probation, they may 
place him either in a foster home or let 
him spend fast lime in boys school, 
Then he's back on the street in 
anywhere from three lo six months,"

Blakely proves potential

Sparks fly at Senate meeting 



By CHRIS PYLE 

As Ihe senators gathered around 
their meeting table last Wednesday 
night, they had no indication what was 
in store for them. Scheduled agenda 
was set aside and conflicts among 
senators erupted. 

The Constitution Commiltee (Steve 
Wcstrick and Bob Griebel) set the 
spark when they pleaded for a one 
week extension to make revisions on 
Ihe Constituliun, Jeff Sandy moved to 
ratify parts of Ihe Constitution at the 
meeting. But when the issue was open 
for debate, bolh sides argued. Some of 
the senators supporting Sandy's 
motion argued it would be easier to 
ratify parts of the Constitution instead 
of "stringing it along." The opposition 
argued it would be easier to ratify the 
Constilulion in its entirely. 

After an informal vole. Sandy with- 
drew his motion and Ihe one week 
extension was granted. 

Because of cohflicls with her 
committee, Ellen Engleman resigned 
her posl as co-chairperson for the 
Sludenl Affairs Commitlee, The 
reasons, she said, were continuii^g 
controversy, disagrecmcnls, lack of 
cooperation and personal allacks, "It I 
were lo propose or introduce 
legislation for the student body, it 
could possibly be turned down because 
of who proposed it, not because of what 
was proposed," shcsaid. 

Animosities surfaced as the senators 
dealt with the controversial discussion 
group — the "caucus" — a panel of 
senators who meet before each Senate 
session. A majority of Ihe IB senators 
comprise the caucus. 

Some of the senators saw Ihe caucus 
as an exclusive invitation only "social 
club." 

The Senate caucus was outlined in a 
memo by Jeff Saiidy "The sole pur- 
pose of Ihe caucus is lo nlliiw free 
intercourse on issues and to let people 
informally hear and question the 
reasoning supporting these 
measures." 



Caucus member Phil Patterson said 
Ihe Webster Dictionary defines a 
caucus as "a group of persons 
belonging to the same political party 
or faclion usually lo decide upon 
policies and candidates, ' ' 

But some of the senators. Patterson 
contended, view it in differenl context 
"Caucus is really Ihe wrong term, but 
that's what we named it. It's a 
subgroup .within the larger group 
which shares idealogy, similarities 
and subjects with the large group and 
probes issues in moredeplh." 

Caucus participant Scott Kuchn 
shared his opinion. "We arc a 
discussion group. We're comfortable 
discussing issues together We 
mlaterialized because we had to 
discuss problems on a one-to-one basis, 
duplicating our arguments. It's easier 
lo gel together all at once. Thus 
meaning, our group is not a 'caucus' but 
rather a discussion group." 

However, Westrick doesn't see it 
Ihal way "I've been told that it's by 
invitation only, and if I came to a 
meeting. I would be made unwelcome, 
resulting in the group conducting their 
meeting elsewhere," said Westrick, 

Englcman agreed "Everyone 
should be included or else it's wrong." 
she said, 

Mea.iwhile, Kuehn claimed Westrick 
and Englcman would be more of a 
hindrance Ihan a help as "caucus " 
parlicipiinls. The caucus members 
feel justlTied closing their meetings as 
tliey are afraid Westrick is "highly 
opinionaled" and Engleman is "loo 
emotional" to deal wilh the issues 
objectively. 

Some critical senators specualte the 
meetings are used to determine how 
caucus members will vote. They claim 
the meetings ore used lo privately 
evaluate potential senators and bring 
more uf Kuehn 's friends in. They 
believe caucus members supporl Ihcir 
associates rather than welcome all 



candidates. Critics of the caucus 
believe its members will not represent 
the student body bul themselves. 

Caucus members argue Iheir 
meetings are designed to discourage 
such behavior. 

The meeting ended with some 
scheduled business unfinished. Malt 
Bonahoom Senate^ president said. 
"I feel as though we have the best 
Senate we've ever had. We have IB 
really good people. It looks as if our 
problems are behind us" 



Senate passes 
new police bill 

IJy CHRIS PVI.K 

Recently, the senate , approved 
Resolution M. legislation outlining Ihe 
role of a campus police officer. The 
resolution slated Ihe senate's support, 
in combined efforts with the chan- 
cellor's ofrice. lo maintain a 
UniversitySafely and Security Unit. 

Resolution M describes Ihe role of 
Ihe University Safety and Security 
Office as one of "service and 
assistance to students, staff and 
visitors in a courteous manner." 

Bul how much power does the 
campus police have? Do they have the 
power to investigateand keep rciords 
on students'' That was a point of 
argumentallon. The resolution stales 
that the "fundamental mission is that 
of a service organization for the 
campus community rather Ihan 
primarily an investigative deparl- 

Senalors that opposed Ihe resolution 
argued Ihal the police have "so much 
time on their hands," and since lliey 
musl go through police academy, they 
should be able lo assume the duties of a 
citypolice officer. 

The majority of the senate passed 
Ihe resolution with no ammendments 
and the only veto was overrule&lt;l. 



Blakely seems to have learned Ihe art 
of speaking loudly in a quiet voice, 
aiming her pointed barbs at the targets 
of sexism and oppression. 

What has made Blakely such an 
outspoken feminist'f "Being a woman" 
was her first reply, but then she 
remembered a situation that brought 
about a dim awareness of the obstacles 
Ihal women often face. 

Her firsi job after college was with 
the largest bank in Chicago, She was 
Ihe only woman among 12 trainees. Her 
enthusiasm for her new job dropped 
sharply when she discovered Ihal five 
years after the Equal Pay Act she 
was being paid $2,500 less Ihan the male 
trainees. Blakely insisted on an ex- 
planation and was shown examination 
grades and rating sheets. She found 
that she was even wilh or ahead of the 
meninallbut onecalegory, 

"On the rating sheets, I received 
ZERO points for potential ; fresh 
out of college and no 
potential. They said that women 
were always rated like that because 
they quit and get married, etc. Well. I 
did quit and move on— tiecause I 
wanted whole paychecks, " 

After five nvore years of curiosity and 
reading about Ihe women's movemenl, 
Blakely moved lo Ft. Wayne, Here she 
met Joan Ubelhoer and Cathryn 
Adamsky and became involved with the 
Women'sSludies program al IPFW. 



Blakely. now a member of Ihe 
chancellor-appointed Women's Studies 
Committee, has an obvious love for Ihe 
program that keeps her coming back 
even though she is dissatisfied with the 
treatment of associate faculty mem- 
bers, 

"Associate faculty are nowhere al 
this university," she said, "The wages 
are appalling for the amount of work 
involved Every time 1 finish for the 
semester, I swear I will never do it 
again. Bul I love Ihe students, I love Ihe 
slaff. and I feel an obligation lo the 
community to contribute to the con- 
tinuation of a good Women's Studies 
program." 

Blakely feels strongly about Women's 
Studies because of the effect it has had 
on her life and Ihe lives of others. 

"Women's Studies courses are a 
ferocious education. It is concrete in- 
formation directly applicable to one's 
own life. I didn't realize wha. was 
possible for women until I became 
involved in this program. I have seen 
women just bloom in these courses. For 
me, it was like a baptism by fire and it 
changed my whole perspective I didn't 
feel crazy anymore when I started 
acting crazy I had lo leave Ihe 
narrowly defined societal mold of a 
woman to finally feel like a woman," 
she said. 

Blakely does happen lo be a wife and 
mother of two children. Married 10 



years, she and husband Howard have 
stient the last four years in a shared 
responsibility, non-traditional type 
marriage, II has not always been 
egalitoriun, 

"One night after we had both come 
home from work and 1 was doing 
laundry with one hand and stirring 
spaghelli with the other. I looked up 
and asked Howie why 1 had to work all 
day and Ihen do all the work at home, 
loo," said Blakely "He looked at me a 
bit sheepishly and said, 'wasn't it in the 
vows''' Since then, we have been 
pioneering new lerrilory— Iradlllonal 
marriage is still so confining, limiting 
and economically draining. We make it 
by breaking a lot of the so-called rules, 
Howie is simply worth it We have a 
private, ever -evolving relationship, and 
arecommittedtomakingitwork." 

Her committment to her children was 
also apparent as she spoke of her 
youngest son— a sweet, dreamy child, 
she said. Blakely has placed him in Ihe 
Learning Center, a nonsexisl, child- 
centered alternative school, because 
she fears Ihal public school might 
distort his personality. The sweet 
dreamers are needed, loo, she feels. 

"1 love being the mother of my 
children," Blakely said, "but I would 
never pass a motherhood lest." She 
notes in her book in the article, "the 
Pros and Cons of Motherhood." that 
.society is loo ready to label women 
"bad mothers." 

Blakely concludes Ihe humorous 
piece by seriously saying that women 
find theirown ways through the maze of

Republican Dan Coats and 
Democrat John Walda both agree a 
presidential victory by Reagan or 
Carter in Indiana will probably not 
affect Iheir own chances for Ihe 
fourth district congressional race 

The factor that determines the 
outcome of that race, they txilh 
agree, will be Iheir locally-run 
campaigns 

The candidates identified inflation 
and the stale of the economy as the 
number one problem facing Ihe 
country, bul that Is where their 
campaign similarities slop. 

Coals, currently a district 
representative for Congressman

allowed to flourish, it will provide 
Ihe necessary employment, 
production and other necessary 
factors lo stimulate Ihe eL-ononiy. He 
emphasized less government iii- 



icnl ;ind 
business. 

Walda. however, relics on his 
social economic philosophy lo 
remedy Ihe economic problem. 
Providing aid and employment for 
low and middle income (amilJes. he 
said, will help gel the economy as a 
whole on firmer grouid. 

Itoth candidates said they support 
education on all levels, but disagree 
as to the type of support. 

Coats who favors honoring all 
present governmental educational 
committments. stressed the 
use— and sometimes abu.se— of 
student loans 

Walda, a local atlorney. endorsed 
the National Education Association 
and Ihe Indiana Stale Teachers' 
Association, The funding of all

for an increase in governmental

Non-voter8 give up 'right' 



With election day less than a month 
away, some Allen counly residents are 
busy campaigning- Others are watching 
the news to keep on lop of the issues. 
This leaves a final group&gt;— those who are 
unconcerned and who have little, if any, 
inlention of voting. 

Unfortunately, it is many of these non- 
voters who, after the election, complain 
about things not getting done, or who 
ridicule government officials for their 
lack of efficiency or for their dishonesty. 

This group of people is. sadly, a large 
one. 

In the 1980 Allen County primary, a 
total of 140,250 people registered to vote. 
Why was it that only 58,800 actually 
voted? We can rationalize by staling that 
Watergate is to blame, or people just 
don'l get out to vote in the primaries, or 
we can even blame the election day 
weather. 

While il is true the effects of 
Watergate were substantial and for 
many people this carried over to local 
politics, and while it is also true many do 
not see the importance of primaries 
(especially if it it's cold or raining), we 
cannot fully attribute low voter turnout 
to these causes alone. 

Is it possible voter apathy in this 
particular election stems from the belief 
that there really is not a good choice 
among candidates? 

This appears to be a common point-of- 

Readers write 



view among many non-voters— as well 
as some voters. They obviously are not 
keeping up with the news, because if 
they were, they would realize the 
political beliefs, ideologies and sen- 
timents of the candidates differ on most 
of the issues. 

Ronald Reagan has repeatedly en- 
dorsed (he use of military power in 
crises, Consequently. President Carter 
claims this election will determine 
whether this country laces peace or 
war. Ronald Regan retorts by saying 
Carter has left the nation defenseless 
and unable to protect itself from outside 
aggression. 

Yet many will slay home on election 
day. 

And what about the women who make 
up some of Ihhat non-voter's group? 
What about the women who have only a 
very basic understanding of ERA, who 
support that basic understanding, and 
yet are convinced that there is not a 
choice among candidates, even though 
Ronald Reagan has spoken unfavorable 
of the ERA on more than one occasion? 

II all boils down to the fact that many 
non-voters, for whatever reason they 
choose not to vote, will be giving up the 
right to cast their ballot— the right for 
which many people struggled, labored 
and even died for many years ago. 
Unfortunately, it is the right so often 
taken for granted in this country. 



ByNICKSTANCER 

We have seen, in the past 
week an example of 
StudenU' Government at 
work: namely, the 
publication of every one of 
[PFW's students' names, 
addresses and telephone 
numt&gt;ers, in a directory 
available to virtually anyone 
who walks into this public 
establishment. 

Many students, myself 
Included, fail Id see the point 
and detest its publication on 
the following grounds; 

1 Uselessness. The pub- 
lication allows anyone 
direct access to my personal 
address and [^one number. 
Why? People who really 
need this Information are 
those who either already 
have il or know me and can 
ask for it. Who else needs it? 

2 Unannounced Public- 
cation. The information 
printed is not a matter of 
"pubHc record" unless 
consent is given. No one 
rememlwrs giving consent, 
but let's "refresh" our minds 
on (his. 

Remember the initial 
Undergraduate Application 
For Admission filled out 
three, four, perhaps five 
years ago? On page two. at 
the bottom (Part C, number 
111, is a request saying, 
"check the following if you 
want the information kept 
confidential : address, 
phone, IwUi." Does this 
assume that everything you 
specifically don't mark 
"confidential" is going to be 
published? 1 certainly hope 
not. 



In three years, a person's 
situation can change a great 
deal. I think it would have 
been wise if the Students' 
Government had announced 
this and given some time lor 
students to consider (or 
reconsider) their previous 
decision. 

3 Possible Side Affects. 
An undesirable person, who 
may have only had a name 
prior to this publication, now 
knows where that person 
lives. Since "the damage is 
done," so to speak— hun- 
dreds of copies are already 
in circulation— I would like 
to be sarcastic for just a 
moment. 

Why didn't Students' 
Government "go all the 
way" with it? I mean, along 
with this information, why 
didn't they also print 
whether we live in a house or 
apartment (location of the 



bedroom window being 
optional) alone or with a 
roommate, and the hours we 
are (or are not) home? 

This would certainly make 
the job of a rapist, 
psychopath or burglar easier 
and far less risky, since 
these people, too, appear to 
t&gt;enefil greatly from such a 
publication. Salesmen of 
college-level magazines, 
twoks and other material 
won't have to waste their 
lime knocking on doors or 
calling when you're not 
home ; now they have a list of 
handy information about 
10,000— plus students, all 
packaged in a nice, compact 
booklet. 

Although exaggerated, I 
think the point is clear. 
Students' Gover- 

nement — "They're 
Working— For All of Us." 




AMONG 

THE 
LIVING 

By NANCY SLICK 




To the Editor 

I would like to comment on 
the article written by Karin 
Buscher regarding the 
Robert Palmer concert. It is 
obvious thai Ms, Buscher 
knows verj' little about the 
subject about which she was 
writing. 

Her comment on Palmer's 
"new song" — "Women Are 
Smarter" — makes tliis 
obvious, especially since this 
particular song was on the 
album "Double Fun" 
released three albums ago. 

As far as the band is 
concerned, the group has 
t)een together (or ap- 
proximately 10 years. I 
would hate to think a band 
that has been together that 
long "needs practice" and is 
"crummy" after all the 
money and success they 
have 

I would also like to know if 
the quote, "I'm trying to be 
new wave." was a direct 



Palmer concert 'best^ in ages 

nuole or not ns this was not music, eradualiv buildine a . . _ *-^ 



quote or not, as this was not 
the impression I got at all. 

I found her comments on 
Gino Vanelli lo be in ex- 
tremely poor taste. Gino has 
been honored with many 
awards praising his abilities, 
and I have found his concerts 
lo be nothing less than 
fantastic. He recently stated 
in an interview that he tell he 
had betrayed his true 
following by playing disco 
and he would not do il again. 
Perhaps this is where she 
came up with the phrase 
"trying to be Graham 
Parker " 

As for the poor attendance 
al Ihe concert, I Ihink if you 
look a random sample of the 
people on campus, you would 
find that very few know who 
he is. As for many of the 
performers of today, a 
certain group of people 
follow a performer for a long 
lime while new people are 
introduced the performt.T's 



music, gradually building a 
larger following. Many 
people may know a par- 
ticular song, but if you ask 
them who sings il, Ihey 
couldn't tell you. 

Her comment "Ihe amps 
were so o\%r-projecled that 
one couldn't understand 
most of the music or words" 
could be looked upon as a 
comment from someone who 
has no idea what conditions 
Uie engineering staff has to 
work with. The Foellinger 
Theater is not the idea 
selling for any kind of 
concert, unless one is in- 
terested in noise, not music 
Perhaps i( did not sound like 
his albums, but that defeats 
the purpose of a live concert 
if one pays to hear the same 
thing one can hear on their 
stereo. 

I, for one, would like to 
thank the entire of Robert 
Palmer and company for- 
bringing some of the best 



entertainijieni to Fort 
Wayne that has been here in 
ages. As for Ms. Buscher, I 
suggest she research her 
information a bit more 
thoroughly next time. 



Otherwise, someone might 
misconstrue her comments 
as slanderous in natiu-e.

By NANCY SLICK 

I'm going lo take a break 
from my usual stab at humor 
this week and attempt lo 
tackle, or at least dent, a 
pressing issue in today's 
society. It is a terribly 
complex issue, and it is 
difficult to know where lo 
start. I am trying to write 
about men's attitudes 
towards women. 

It is difficult to write about 
this because I am not a man. 
I don't know how a male 
thinks. I don't know why 
many of them feel 
threatened by women. I 
don't know why men justify 
the heinous crime of rape by 
holding the victim respon- 
sible for the actions of 
someone who should be able, 
and indeed is duty bound, lo 
control his own actions. I 
don't know how they could 
possibly think that whistling 
and hollering at women is in 
any way appreciated, 
although I recognize the 
existence of some women 
who for some reason enjoy 
the cheap attention received 
from an equally cheap 
flaunting of their bodies. 

When I think of heading 
through my life with a career 
befitting my abilities, I am 
very dejectedly halted. I 
remember that despite the 
talents, strengths and in- 
telligence of myself and 
society's other females, top 
jobs and proper pay are held 
by men. whether they are 
deserving or not. 

When I want to go to a 
movie, all I can see ad- 
vertised are films of 



dementia— crazed men with 
extreme sexual in- 
securities-murder women 
haplessly, and thousands of 
others in the audience gel the 
warped notion from this 
"entertainment" that 
there's nothing wrong with 
it! Why would anyone pay 
hard-earned money lo see 
something so obviously sick? 

When 1 read the 
newspapers, I see staggering 
statistics of violent crimes 
against women by men. I see 
crimes of violence— not sex, 
but violence bred from hate. 
And why? 

When I want to go for a 
walk alone, I can't doll. I get 
a display of tactless behavior 
from insensitive males who 
yell demeaning comments or 
offer lewd gestures. Don't 
they have any self-respect? 
Aren't they ashamed to act 
so rudely? 

I know all men aren't like 
this. I know some who are so 
secure of their sexual 
identities they would never 
stoop to any of the above, 
they know women aren't 
"out to get" them, they 
recognize women's 

capabilities, they aren't 
afraid of feeling or showing 
emotions, tenderness or 
sensitivity, and at the same 
time, they are very strong, 
accomplished and 

masculine. They respect 
women and they respect 
themselves. But why, oh 
why, do other men hate 
women so? We are not the 
enemy! We are here on this 
' Earth, in this life together. 
Let's befriends.

Museum provokes questions 



0CT0BER9. I'JBQ - THE COMMUNICATOR -PAGE 3 



By TIMOTHY J. ROSS 

Why is Fort Wayne here? 

This is probably the first 
question one might ask on a 
lour through the new Allen 
County-Fort Wayne 
Historical Society Museum 
at 302 East Berry. 

The answer may be found 
in any one of the museum's 
40 exhibits, but that is 
unlikely because, according 
to David Crosson, the 
museum director, the 
exhibits are meant to 
provoke questions. 

Strong university lies to 
the museum were created 
through the assistance of 
IPFW students and faculty. 
History professor Cliff Scott 
explained it is necessary to 
produce artifacts and 
historical data as the basis of 
an exhibit. 

Both, in part, were sup- 
plied by IPFW students and 
faculty. Ralph Violette, 
assistant professor of history 
at IPFW, lended his talent 



with the FVench language by 
translating a document for 
the museum. The paper, 
written in old French, dealt 
with fur trading prices. 

Jack Kirby. associate 
professor of education, 
researched the execution of 
hatchet murderer, Sam 
McDonald. The noose that 
stretched McDonald's neck 
and his handy hatchet make 
a colorful display at the 
museum. 

As part of an individual 
study program, Jane 
Raifsnider, a student at 
IPFW. studied and 
researched a small cobbler's 
shop. The study shows the 
changes in the Fortreed 
Shoe store — a small Fort 
Wayne business — over a 
course of years. 

Another IPFW student 
examined the life of a man 
named Wilts Wills was 
responsible for much sur- 
veying in early times around 
Allen County. Some early 
surveyor's instruments are 



included in the exhibit. 

A large presiding officers 
table was also made 
available to the museum 
through the efforts of 
another IPFW student. The 
table is a part of labor 
history. 

According to the museum 
director, a lot of the 
university's help came from 
history professor Cliff Scott, 
who was drawn into the 
venture as a board member 
of the Historical Society, 
Scotl helped to secure fun- 
ding for the museum and 
helped with the exhibits. 

"I wrote what I like to 
think was an important part 
of the grant application — a 
short history of Fort Wayne 
and Allen County pointing 
out the events and how they 
might be used — and I 
supplied some of the more 
specific stuff on World War I 
for an exhibit," said Scott. 

The museum was moved 
frorti the old Swinney home 
to its downtown location — 



once the site of Ihe Old City 
Hall — due to a lack of space 
and facilities. 

The move, according to 
Scott and Crosson. will aid in 
downtown reconstruction as 
well. Both men believe Ihe 
museum and the other sites 
— the art museums, the Old 
Fort and the Embassy 
Theater — will make Fort 
Wayne a cultural ex- 
perience. 

The old Swinney museum 
won't be forgotten either. 

A subsidiary group to the 
Historical Society — known 
as the settlers — will turn the 
homestead into a period 
house II will be restored to 
look as it did some time in 
thel890's. 

The new museum will be 
dedicated Oct. 10at7:30p.m. 
The doors will open to Ihe 
public from 12 lo 5 p.m. on 
October 11 and 12. 

An admission fee — SI per 
child, $2 per adult and J5 per 
family —will be charged.

rules, sanctions and guilt and learn to 
honor their committment lo their 
children.... We wouldn't trade the 
goosebumps that rise when the rushes 
of affection tell us, however tenously, 
that if we had to choose again, we would 
still, incredibly, choose mothering." 

Although Blakely has chosen many 
roles for herself in life, she feels she 
did not choose what has come to be a 
prominent leadership role in the 
feminist movement. 

"1 feel uncomfortable with this high, 
public profile. I do make a public 



committment with my writing, and 
with that comes a certain 
nolariely— and an incredible amount of 
support. But I gel a lot of support just 
for doing what many women quietly do 
every day, " Blakely said. 

Someone once characterized her as a 
"fighter" and she said it really startled 
her. "I'm a laugher, not a figliter. But 
they put me in the same decade as 
Ronald Reagan and there's bound to be 
aclash." 

Her ability lo laugh and make others 
laugh is evident in "Pulling Our Own 



Strings." Blakely has written four of 
the selections herself, including a 
delightful, witty introduction. The book 
includes two articles authored by Joan 
Ublehoer and pieces by Gloria Sleinam, 
Nora Ephrcn. Marilyn French, Flo 
Kennedy, and Ellen Goodman, among 
others. 

Blakely said she and co-author Gloria 
Kaufman fell like gardeners, carefully 
gathering the bouquets of others. "We 
wanted lo document and chronicle Ihe 
very special culture and folklore of 
women. We also see it as an educational 
tool, with humor as one of the mosi 
effective implements in gelling the 
point across." 



The book is doing very well The first 

printing was sold out before Ihe official 
publication dole, and the book is into a 
second printing. The Book-of-the-Month 
Club has also chosen to offer il. 

The future holds many intriguing 
possibbilitjes for Blakely and her book. 
Wherever those possibilities take her. il 
is almost sure thai good humor and 
laughterwillfollow, 

Mary Kay Blakely is an award- ( 
winning columnist, feminisi, wife, 
author, keynote speaker, educator, ' 
mother and co-founder of Natural 
Changes, a consulting firm on the 
changing roles of women and men. 

And they suld she had no potential,

New season at PIT 



Show eye-opening 



By MICHELE 

DeVINNEY 

Aflerfive weeks Of nightly 
rehearsals, the cast and 
cr^' of "Whal ihe Butler 
Saw'' are now putting the 
Tinishing louches on Purdue- 
Indiana Theatre's first 
production of tlie season. 

"What the Butler Saw" is a 
modern tarce set in a 
psychiatric chnic. The 
playwright. Joe Orton. at- 
tacks many of the people and 
ideals which most consider 
sacred, including family life, 
the medical profession, 
religion and sex Orton takes 
Ihe madness of life and 
makes his audience laugh at 
whal is usually taken 
seriously, making them 
wonder if they should lake it 
seriously at all. 

Maureen O'Reilly, 
director o( the play, said that 
■'Butler" is both funny and 
shocking "While 1 don't 
want to apologize for doing 
Ihe play, I do want lo warn 
people lo Ik ready for a 
comically eye-opening and 
slightly risque show." 

"Butler" is typical of 
Orion's plays. Along 
with"Lool," "Entertaining 
Mr. Sloane" and "Crimes of 
Passion," "What the Butler 
Saw" establishes Orion's 
black humor. 



In examining and 
criticizing society and its 
values, Orion chose comedy 
as his vehicle ralher than 
drama He once said, "I love 
Ihe comedy of 'Candide,' 
where people are totally 
disreputable, bul the issuea 
are absolutely serious." 

Through his own tragic 
life, Orton developed keen 
insight and whal Time 
magazine called "a 
machine gun wit," His 
friend, Charles Marowiti, a 
prominent critic and 
director, said, "He was free 
from all illusions and saw 
straighter into a social 
situation than anyone I ever 
met." 

To introduce Fort Wayne 
to Orton's irreverant brand 
of humor will be a cast that 
includes Jack Spring, 
Jeanne Hoffman, Dan Harth, 
Darrell Hankey, Nancy 
Anria and Carl Sargent. 

Spring and Hoffman are 
both from the community 
rather than students at 
IPFW School policy states 
that 51 percent of the cast 
must be comprised of 
students. thus allowing 
students an opportunity lo 
work with experienced 
actors withoul denying them 
a fair chance lo get involved. 



Darrell Hankey, a 
psychology major and cast 
member, said he enjoys 
working with members of 
the community. "The best 
way to learn is to work with 
accomplished actors." 

Director O'Reilly points 
out that it's educalional for 
bolh the students and the 
older actors since they can 
study each other's methods 
and styles. 

O'Reilly is enthusiastic 
about "Butler," She joined 
the staff this year, and this 
will be her debut at PIT 
Despite long hours involved 
in preparing the production, 
O'Reilly is enjoying it and 
calls the cast "delightful" 

The respect is mutual. 
"She's great lo work with. 
She's really energetic." said 
cast member Dan Harth, a 
theatre major 

All involved are pleased 
with Ihe progress of 
rehearsals and feel the show 
will be a success. 

The show opens Oct. lo and 
continues with weekend 
performances through Oct. 
25 Tickets are $4 50 for 
adults. $4.00 for faculty and 
staff, $3.00 for senior citizens 
and $2.00 for I.D students. 
More information can be 
obtained by calling the PIT 
box office.

ByMIKEGEFFEN 
When there is chemistry 
between performers and the 
audience, it can be felt 
There is a rush of electricity 
emanating from the stage 
that hits row by row until it 
starts the audiences 
adrenalin pumping and feet 
moving, and makes (he 
theatre pulse with ex- 
citement. This was the kind 
of electricity generated by 
Buddy Rich and Mel Torme 
at the Embassy Sunday 
night. 

The concert was two hours 
of non-slop jazz Buddy Rich 
opened the show with his 
unique style of big band 
sound. His fantastic 
drumming was aided and 
backed up by his great band. 
One of the highlights of 
Rich's first set was the 
song, "Love For Sale," 
which featured a ten minute 
saxophone solo by Jack 
Martinson and a long piano 
solo by Ernie Van Trise. 
These solos showed how 
versatile Rich's band is and 
how it can take the audience 
from a soft, ballad in- 
troduction to a hard-driving 
blues song, all in the short 
space of one tune. 

Rich's first portion of the 
concert was capped by a 
fifteen minute drum solo 
which showed his artistry. 
He did every possible thing 
that could be done on drums. 
He played the cymbals in an 
incredible show of dexterity, 
played the drum rim and 
moved so fast from one 
section of drums to another. 



the audience couldn't foUow 
his hands. This rousing drum 
solo led lo the first standing 
ovation of the evening. 

Mel Torme came out and 
mellowed the concert with a 
nice rendition of "Here's 
That Rainy Day." Along 
with his smooth voice, 
Torme has a relaxed stage 
presence that came out when 
he joked around with the 
audience. 

The highlight of his portion 
of the concert came when he 
performed his big band 
version of the jazz standard, 
"Bluesetle " Torme's wide 
vocal range was spotlighted 
in this tune. 

The concert reached it's 
peak when Rich and Torme 
did some numbers together. 
Their affection for each 
other was apparent as they 
kidded around, and the 
chemistry thai clicked 
between them filtered out 
into the Embassy and 
brought the crowd to their 
feet. The packed, en- 
thusiastic house went wild 



when they performed "Blues 
In The Night" and their 
tribute to one of the jazz 
greats in "Ella," 

Rich's percussive 
drumming blended 

beautifully with Torme's 
mellow voice in these 
numbers, and they showed 
why 'Jieir album is a hit. The 
numbers had some nice 
"give and take" between 
Torme and Rich, and worked 
because the artists were ; 
simply having tun. The scat i 
singing in "Ella" showed 
Torme's gift. Their duet in 
this number, where Torme . 
scatted to Rich's drum solo, . ■ 
proved that these men are ,s 
reaching the prime of their ' 
talents. 

The Torme-Rich concert 
was one of the finest jazz 
concerts ever lo come to 
Fort Wayne. The fact that 
these performers got not just 
one, but four standing 
ovations, proves this. The 
crowd was "up" for a great 
evening of jazz, and Rich and 
Torme didn't lei it down, '-

Police urge legal parking 



Crosswalks, grass, land 
scsped areas and no 
parking zones are not proper 
parking spaces, according to 
Maurice Shady, chief of 
police at IPFW. 

Drivers with "B" permits 
who park in "A" lots are also 
guilty of improper parking, 
he said. 



Shady staled in a letter 
scnl lo Jack Ulmer, dean of 
student services, "We are 
having an enormous amount 
of improper parking by (he 
students, staff and faculty." 

The chief also said he has 
received complaints about 
the lack of proper parking 
spaces. "Although parking 



close to Keltler and Neff 
Halls are at a premium," he 
said, "it would be in 
everyone's best interest to 
remind them that parking is 
available in the north union 
lot and also in the free lot 
across the river . until such 
time as additional parking 
spaces can be made 
available." 



Youth, cont. from page 1 



"It's hard for me to con- 
sider a 17 or lB-year'«ld as a 
kid," West emphasized. 
"I've busted 13-year-old 
hookers in Fort Wayne's 
ghetto. Nothing surprises me 
anymore. We've got all the 
same problems as Chicago, 
Detroit and New York— just 
on a smaller scale is ail." 

CASE IN POINT: At 16, 
Robert is a youth from the 
poor while districts of Fort 
Wayne. His crimes include 
auto theft, armed robbery, 
burglary, resisting arrest 
and distribution of drugs and 
assault, 

"I'm pretty sure I shot a 
guy. He was up on this here 
roof. Well, I shot up at him 
and his own gun fell to the 
pavement. At least I haven't 
seen the guy since, "Robert 
said smiling. 

Robert's former super- 
visor, when he was locked up 
at Wood Youth Center in 
Fort Wayne, described 
Robert as cold and "just 
plain rotten." The officer 
predicted Robert would one 
day kill somebody. 

Lynda Graham, who was 
Robert's probation officer, 
agreed. "Robert is com- 
pletely immoral," she saidf 



"I've never seen an ounce of 
remorse from that boy . " 

As Robert smoked a 
cigarette, occasionally 
brushing the fallen ashes 
from his leather jacket, he 
freely volunteered in- 
formation. 

"I can easily make $700 a 
week," he boasted. "The 
most I can make is from 
dealing in drugs. That's 
easy. The cops may say they 
are doing something about 
the drug traffic, but they 
ain't. 

"The most I ever made 
though was when a buddy 
and I ripped off a Honda 
shop. We made $11,000 a 
piece on that job." 

Where has all of Robert's 
money gone? 

"Partying, man," he 
quipped. "I like to buy booze 
for my friends. As for 
myself, I love cocaine, and 
believe me, it's an expensive 
habit," 

People who have dealt 
with Robert in the past 
warned of his deep personal 
need to boast. Even though 
his criminal record is long, 
authorities can neither 
verify nor discount all of his 
claims. 



"You see, everybody 
wants to stay out of trouble, 
but for me, it's a good time," 
Robert said. 

Between jails, correctional 
centers, and placements, 
Robert estimates he has 
spent approximately seven 
years of his life locked up, 

"It's worth spending 
time," he said. "I always 
have a lot waiting for me 
when I get out. Right now 
I've got $7,000 stashed away 
and a .357 magnum. If I can 
pull this one big job I 've got 
planned, I'll be set quite 
awhile." 

Robert also jokes about 
treating everyone equal. 
"Shit, I've sold drugs lo 
people ages lllo JO. It makes 
no difference," he con- 
cluded. 

And what about the future 
of these youthful offenders? 

Mike, who has lived seven 
years in I'ort Wayne and 
currently faces three more 
months of incarceration for 
theft and assault, was 
prophetical about his future: 
"I think I'll be dead before I 
go to prison— somebody will 
probably shoot myass,"

Komets open season Saturday 

Lallo welcomes 30 hopefuls 



PAGE 6 — THE COMMUNICATOR — OCTOBER 9. 1980 



By MIKE FRANKE nalional Hockey Uague 

On Salurday night, the season at the Memorial 

Fori Wa&gt;Tie KomeU will Coliseum against last 

open their I9B0-81 In ter- season's Turner Cup finals 




(oe, the Kalamazoo Wings. 

Last Monday, Komet 
coach Moose Lallo welcomed 
some 30 players to the first 
day o( workouts in 
preparation for the season 
opener. Lallo has only five 
days to whip the Komet 
hopefufs into shape. He's not 
worried though. "The Komets 
will have a week off from 
J.H.L. play after Saturday's 
game. This will give the 
Komel coach plenty of time 
lo gel the Komet machine in 
high gear. 

When II comes to 
preparing for an I.H.L. 
season, Moose Lallo is an 
expert. Prior to coaching in 
Fort Wayne, Lallo spent 18 
years as a player and coach 
for the Muskegon Mohawks 
of the I. HL. 

Lallo was an active player 
until the age of forty-one, 



gaining a reputation as one 
of the toughest defensemen 
in the league. When Lallo 
was a player, a good 
majority o( players were 
lough, hard-nosed hockey 
players. He is quick to point 
out, however, that they were 
not "goons," a term he uses 
to describe some of the 
modern-day roughnecks. 

In regard to the 1980-Sl 
Komel roster, Lallo has 
quite a large selection to 
choose from. 

Reluming from last year's 
team are veteran goaltender 
Robbie Irons, Peter 
Crawford, Terry McDougall, 
Gary DeLong, Richard 
Pepin. Barry Scully, Dan 
Erickson, Dave Norris and, 
from the '78-'79 season, Mike 
Penase, 

A group of veteran I.H.L. 
players acquired in an off-

Monday In preparation lor this Salurdav's opening game

HyCimiSPYLE 
Tlie women 's volleyball 
team is experiencing bad 
breaks m seasonal play. Two 
new starters have been in- 
jured and the season's 
record now stands al 2-9, 

The seasonal record Is 
Jetermined by Ihe scores of 
Ihe matches. A match is 
usually made up of 3 lo 5 
games The team that wins 
Ihe most games claims the 
match. 

The spikers traveled to 
Hammond to play Purdue 
Calumel and St. Marys 
College The IPFW squad 
caplured a 15-2 viclory in the 
first game agamsl Purdue 
Calumel. but failed lo win 
the match by losing -1-15 and 
13-15, 

The second match pitted 
the Tuskers against St, 
Marys IPFW lost the game 
in 8 squeaksr. H-16 and won 
the second game. 15-10, 

The third game was^fatal 
to the match as the spikers 
lost 9-15 Coach Pegg&gt;' Voisin 
said. "We were ahead in the 
third game St Marys then 



Sulurday's match al the 
Valpraiso Invilalional 
presented a challenge as the 
team was defeated in all four 
matches. Playing against 
AIAW Division U teams, the 
Tuskers struggled but were 
shut out in the first game 
with Indiana Tech, 0-15 
Trying to make a comeback. 
the spikers were only able to 
score 6-15 in the second 
game. Voisin said, "Indiana 
Tech had a strong team. We 
are division III and the 
teams we are now playing 
are division 1 and II You 
have to play tougher com- 
petition to get belter." 

In the final round, the 
Tuskers faced a tough game 
against Indiana Tech and 
lost 4-15. Gaining momen- 
tum, the spikers lost the 
second game by a closer 
margin of 9-15. 

The season has been a 
challenge Two starters have 
been injured. Nancy Rorick 
dislocated a finger and Kim 
Heimann suffered an injured 
shoulder The IPFW squad is 
determined to keep fighting. 
Voisin said, "We had had 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

The IPFW men's soccer 
team took It on the chin by 
losing two out of three games 
last week The Tuskers lost 
0-1 to Tri State and 1-5 
against Bethel, but shut out 
Purdue-Calumel, 2-0, 

Against Tri State, the 
Tuskers executed a careless 
performance. 

"It was a sloppy game. We 
took ihem too lightly," said 
Coach Ed Stefankiewicz, 

Against Bethel, IPFW 
tried but just could not come 
up with Ih^ goals In a game 
played in pouring-down rain. 
James Henmueller scored 
the onlygoal for the Tuskers. 
Bethel scored Iwo goals on 
penalty kicks in the Tusker 
loss. 



"We dJd what we had lo do, 
but we just couldn't score," 
said Stefankiewicz. 

Goals by Tom Johnsonand 
Dave Husar enabled IPFW 
lo win over a physical but 
scoreless Purdue Caltmiet 
team IPFW look 17 shots as 
compared lo Purdue's 25. 
Stefankiewicz praised 
goalies Dennis Knuth and 
Mark Blessing for their 
performances 

The Tuskers are now 
halfway through the season 
and are at 5-3 According to 
Stefankiewicz, IPFW can 
lose at most two more games 
and still be eligible for the 
NCAA Division UI playoffs. 

"I think we will improve," 
said Stefankiewicz. 

IPFW plays a lough Grace 
team on Saturday, 



tied us 9-9. We lost the ball breaks but we're hanging in 



and the game."

also on hand. The Komets 
will also be taking a look al 
some rookie players sent to 
them by their parent clubs, 
the New York Islanders, the 
Vancouver Canucks and the 
Winnipeg Jets. 

With the group of veteran 
players returning, and a host 
of rookies in camp, there is a 
great deal of optimism 



Tillering through the Komet 
organization. 

Regarding college hockey, 
Lallo feels very strongly that 
Fort Wayne could support 
college hockey, A good 
hockey city like Fort Wayne 
is a natural for college 
hockey, especially at IPFW. 
The park board leagues and 
high school hockey 
programs would be a natural 
feeder to a college program.
