On November 1 1, clients of the IPFW Child Care Center, located at the corner 
an Crescent and Hobson roads, were shocked to learn that the center 
will be closing its' doors at the IPFW campus on December 18, when they 
opened an email on Wednesday morning. 

The departure of the center will leave 22 employees - 4 non-students and 18 
student workers- jobless. The parents of the 109 children that the center sen/es will 
be forced to find a new child care center that can provide comparable service in a 
convenient location.

Depanmenl's newest

l*lier To The Editor: 



Beauty Pageant 
Frustrates IPFW 



1 am wTiiinR in response to The Communicator 
arliclc/nplnlnn titled "Beauty txchanged For Schol- 
arships' Since alt three of my children (one currently 
enrolled) and myself attended IPI-W. and because 
Ihe currently enrolled siudenl has participated in the 
Miss IPIW Scholarship Pageant ProRram, I feel com- 
pelled lo respond (o this slanted, inaccurate, decep- 
tive and incllive journalism. 

Allhriugh Ihe writer did apparently research 
"some" of the rules of the local Miss America Orga- 
nization (MAO) qualifying pageants, which include 
Miss IPIW, Miss lori Wayne and Miss Three Hivers 
Festival, she failed to note or fully and accurately 
Invcstigale ihc many positive attributes of the pro- 
gram. II Is also clear the interviewed source is woe- 
hilly void of Ihe truth. It is a fact that the majority 
of judging criteria Is based on Interview and talent, 
not beauty. Oilier aspects of scoring, which may 
be incorrectly perceived as being based on strictly 
beauty, include a measure of fitness and conhdence 
iiitd pulse. Also, Ihe judges consider biographies of 
Ihc coniesiants which include-s their college Iran- 
script. Recent Miss IPITV winners have been excep- 
tional sludenis and representatives of the university. 

There is also the matter that the organization 
heavily promnies community service. The anicle 
fiiilfd lo mention MAO's involvement in ftindraising, 



and support in general of the Children's' Miracle Nei 
work, and the fact each contestant has their own ad 
dilional platform. I have been personally blessed witli 
getting to know and develop relationships with many 
of the wonderful young ladies, parents and program 
administrators, through my daughter's involvcnieni 
in the organization. These ladies ate roll models for 
younger folks, and take it seriously. 

My experience in the Miss IPFW Scholarship Pag- 
eant is that you have a group of caring, inlelligcni, 
confident, physically fil and talented students \7ing 
for some scholarship money to assist in theireduia 
tional expenses and pursuing their dreams. ThiM' 
women are well-rounded students, good citi/eriN 
and future leaders. Sometimes they are attraclivi' 
on the outside, but almost always beautiful on ilu- 
inside. The university and student body should he 
proud of them. The newspaper should feel com 
pelled to print the truth. I suggest interviewfing the 
pageant directors for accurate information. 

Sincerely.

Nolc to readers: Lasl week's Beauty Pageant article was supposed to be labled an opinion piece. 



U'ller To Tlie Editor: 



YOU CAN'T SHOOT HERE (response) 




This letler is in response to the "Letter To The 
Editor You OuVt Shoot Here" article. While I may 
understand the disgust or annoyance that the young 
filmmakers/ photographers may have cause while 
shooting, but since there is no wrinen sign in place, 
what the students were doing was completely legal. 
Photographers/ Film Makers are entirely in the free 
and clear to shoot wherever there is no expectation 
of privacy. 

Bert P. Kriiges. Attomy At Law from the State of 



Oregon stales in his publication The Phoiographers' 
ItighKtliough please bear in mind, this is not official 
legal advice, just a generality of the law): "Most 
confrontations are started by security guards and 
employees of organizations who fear photography. 
Tile most common reason given is security but often 
such persons have no articulated reason. Security is 
tarcly a legitimate reason for restricting photography, 
laking a photograph is not a terrorist act nor can a 
business legitimately assert that taking a photograph 
of a subject in public view infringes on its trade 
secrets," 

I'm not necissarlly defending the videographer 
in this case, nor am I attacking the helpdesk 
administrator. The fact of the matter is, there was a 
clear disregard of the law on both ends. The attage "If 
you can see it. you can shoot it" applies given that the 
videographer was not using any impractical means 
(long zoom lenses, hiding, etc) to achieve the images. 
Since there was a lack of any noted sign slating that 
phoiography/videography was prohibited, according 
to my interpretation of the law, the videographer was 
completely in the clear, and wouldn't necissarily have 
to answer and/or leave the premises. 

Kages continues. "You are under no obligation lo 
explain the purpose of your photography nor do you 
have to disclose your identity except in states that 
require it upon request by a law enforcement officer" 

Once again, this letter is not intended to instigate 
controversy, rather, show my frustrations vrith the 
disregard of whether or not the videographer could, 
or could not, 'shoot here*. 

Sincerely, 

A Concerned Photographer

What is the best car to drive? 

By Devin and Hana 



Girl: Tliinklng economically, 1 would say get 
a small, used, manual car. Ttic smaller the car. 
ihe better i( will be on gas mileage. Also, being 
a manual towers in u.se on fuel. I drive a Niitsan 
200SX and 1 can get about 40 miles to Ihe gallon 
in my little green bullet. 

If you are looking for safely, A Mercedes Is the 
only way to go. The new models are qiiHe pricey, 
yes, but you can find an older model thai runs 
jusi as well, if you have a few thousand lo spend. 
They arc built wrilh metal rodi In ihe door^ so that 
on impact, the door will not smash in like u wall 
wnuld. protecting you better. I Inwever. Mercedes 
are a bit pricier to maintain, but 1 believe thai 
your life is worth il; especially in our Indiana 
winters wiih the slick, icy roads. If you find a local 
mechanic that specializes, like my dad, you might 
be able to get better rates. 

If you need something that is cheaper lo fix, 
definitely go widi American made. Pant are 
cheaper and more mechanics can fix Ihcm, 
making prices go down. 

If style and speed is preferred, and you have 
the funds, try a Lamborghini. Bui in all truth, 
there are not a whole lot of college students who 
can afford that, but a giri can dream. 

Boy: The right car to drive is Ihe one that is not 
very expensive, runs properly and is good on gas. 
That is all you really need. Money does not grow 
on trees people. Why put so much money into 
your car when most likely, you do not even have 
your dream job yet. Wait until you have a lot of 
money to spend on a car before you pour your life 
savings into it. Because realistically, you are not 
going lo go racing at two in the morning as in Fast 
&amp; Furious. You are not Paul Wftilker. Vm Diesel, 
lyressc, or any of his other cohorts, so lets stop 
pretendinglikewe have any Idnd of valuable street 
credentials. There are people dying overseas and 
people staying sick here in America due to lack of 
insurance, and you want to put lights under your 
car so people can know what your favorite color 
is while you drive. 1 will admit, it looks cool, but tt 
is not imporlani at all. The man should make the 
car look good, but it scenu now people want the 
car to make them look good.

DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL 

IF 

f Alter tKe Ending 

^y| 111 733- 




By Mark Cox 



Chris Carrabba put a loi of 
thought into his newly released 
album. Alter the Ending, which 
has been leleased t\TO &gt;-ears after 
Tlie Shade of Poison Tives. With the 
new sound of Vie Shade of Poison 
7&gt;CT3. many fans left the fan base of 
Dashboard Confessional because 
it did not sound like the classic 
stuff they used to produce. Hearing 
Alter the Ending it is evident that 
Canabba noticed this and decided 
it was probably a belter idea to 
stick to what tie kno%s3 best and 
lo produce a similar album to his 
last bimch of successful Gold and 
Platinum releases. 

My (a\T&gt;rile aspect of this album 
is that v-ou gel the best of both 



worlds: you get the whole album, 
plus a second album with the same 
songs in acoustic formats. I'm a 
big fan of his full-band tracks and 
of his acoustic tracks, so I feel like 
this album was tailored for my ovm 
musical tasres. When I'm feeling 
more upbeat J can listen to the 
original album and when I'm calm 
and want something easy to listen 
to I can pop in the acoustic album. 
One of my favorite tracks on this 
album is "Get Me Bight' because it 
starts off calm and gets faster and 
louder once the song goes on. This 
albimi is very fim and easy to listen 
to. 

.Mlhough I like the sounds of the 
fuD band tracks on the main album. 
I feel like ihe&gt;- are \■er^■ cliche and 
have too much of a pop sound, 
which is another reason ivhy I realh- 
hke the acoustic rersion. 1 feel Uke 
they sound a bit like jimmy Eat 



World in some songs. 'Belle of the 
Boulevard" was released for the 
Universal Pictures movie 'Cirque 
Du Freak: The Vampires Assistant" 
and on their MySpace to promote 
the new album that was released 
last Tuesday, which is anticipated to 
have a high outcome for purchases.

fact thai they have no 
issues with discussing 
both the love and loath-

This album falls short 
entirely of doing this.

Art and love have a fascinating 
relationship. In some occasions art is the 
object of affection and in other scenarios 
love can be considered a form of an. When il 
comes 10 seniors and graphic design majors 
at IPFW. Cortney "Felt* Fettinger and April 
Klingaman, an is the vehicle that brought 
(he engaged couple together. 

Fett and Klingaman met each other 
in a package design class. After working 
with each other in a group project they 
recognized the chemistry that they shared 
and their relationship took off from there. 

Pan of the couples' chemistry is how 
their styles work in concert with each other. 
They are like flip sides of the graphic design 
coin. Feti likes to "ride the line between fine 
an and graphic design' employing more 
freehand techniques. While Klingaman 
prefers to use computer programs a 
technique (ha( is prominent in commercial 
an. "A loi of my stuff is a liide too artsy to 
be commercial. Generally 111 put together 
something way out there and she'll reel it 
into something usable" said FetL 

Although a couple meeting in (he VCD 
department isn't an uncommon occurrence 



- every year ihere Is at leajit one couple who 
pairs off within the departmeni -however, a 
couple sharing a senior projcci Is. Wlilch Is 
exactly what Fetl and Klingaman arc doing. 

What makra their project even more 
unusual is dial fad that it will have 
immcdiaie real world implications. The 
couple is rebranding "Device Tattoo'- a 
tattoo shop located In the marketplace of 
Canterbury. 

Fett b a tattoo anisl and Klingaman 
interns for Device, which is where he got 
the idea to recreate the shop's image. 'I 
got a new job and saw a need, which Is 
what our project is" said Fell. He quicldy 
got Klingaman involved, thinking thai they 
could win "Best of Show' -an award given 
to best designed project ■ together . *I just 
thought it would be a great way for us to 
complete our project and to give something 
to who 1 work for" he said. 

for their project, the couple took the 
multiple looks that Device had been uilng 
on fliers, business cards, posters and other 
literature that they distribuied lo the public- 
They created a uniform design and logo 
that would be used for ail of shop's future 
collateral. They also worked with Device's 
tanoo anists to create portfolios that they 
were consistent with the shop's brand.

It is all good? Nope, but it is all GREEN 



By Kelly McLendon 



There li a baiile going on, 
and It involves the American 
Recovery and ReinvMtmeni 
Act lAHflA). This sialuic 
Invnlvfi something called a 
'Buy America" requlrcmenl. 
By Iceepiiig products made in 
America, jobs can be retained 
and added, something that 
Is clearly not happening in 
Nonhcnst Indiana. 

Over the past two years, 
the region has suffered a 
good amount of job loss by 
the manufacturing industry. 
This ha* resulted in a loss 
of employment for current 
workers and no prospects for 
new Jobs for those who may be 
just joining the worlcfnrce. 

On Saturday November 
14, The Nonhcasl Indiana 
Working Green Alliance 
(NEIWGAl hosted the Working 
Cireen c:onference in Walb 
Student Union. The group 
addresses green job and 
environmental Issues and is a 
very new organization In this 
area. 

Tlio idea of the meeting 
was to present what is going 
oi) with green jobs and the 
climate locally. There was talk 
o( solar panel engineering and 
wind energy production. There 
was also a heavy emphasis 
on the poverty and green job 



crinni-tii'in: one man who 
bad a table at the conference 
talked about how important it 
was to train people to work in 
environmentally friendly job 
held.s. 

Before the conference 
began, a few people gathered 
arnund to chat and share 
(heir personal views of the 
manufacturing business gone 
wrong. By 9 a,m., it was clear 
that only around 30 people 
showed up, but there was 
seating for about one hundred. 

Bowden Quinn was the first 
speaker of the morning. He 
spoke about climate chan[;(- 
and the bu7j:word of the piiM 
few years, global warmitn' 
Bowden is the conservamm 
coordinator for the Honsitr 
Chapter of the Sierra Club and 
also works on two national 
energy campaigns. 

His presentation showed 
that the average summer 
temperatures in Indiana will 
rise 3 degrees Fahrenheit in 
the next 30 years. While this 
seems sketchy, this would 
mean that nearly every day in 
the summer, the temperatures 
would be over 90 degrees and 
a handful of days would be 
over 100 degrees, making it 
unbearably hot. 

Tile climate change docs 
have an important effect on 
disease. As the temperature 
rises and glaciers disappear, 
more disease will appear.

Mosquitoes will survive the 
winter, not dying off like they 
typically do and will therefore 
bring more incidence of 
malaria. When the winters no 
longer get cold enough to kill 
off insects during the vdnler, 
they will continue to multiply 
in stronger forms. 

The disappearance of the 
glaciers is aJso something to 
be concerned about. Bowden 
said, especially with the 
Himalayas being a major 



source of drinking water for 
many people. If that water goes 
away, problems will ensue. 

But, the problems are 
largely from people. There is 
a "95% consensus that it is 
caused by human activities." 
Bowden said, stating that some 
of these effects are going to 
have serious impacts on tiarlh. 

There is hope, though. 
Bowden said that we do have 
(he technology to help these 
problems right now. through 



energy and renewable*, 

In the end, the NlilWCA 
"brings together a diverse 
group of educators, 

environmental, community, 
and labor activists to foster 
dialogue in order to develop 
creative solutions to rebuild 
the economy of this region 
that is not only green but

A swift bump from the back row straight up 
lo [he seller Is all it takes. As the ball leaves the 
sellers hand it's only a split second or two before 
the outside or middle hitler's solid swing makes a 
connection, and only a blink of an eye before the 
ball makes contact with the gym floor across the 
net. This is what you can expect this year as the 
2009-20 lOVolleydons take the coun. 

*1 hope that our players can play to their 
capabilities/ potential because I believe that we 
as a team, and individually, have a lot of potential 
going forward.' said Assistant Coach. Ryan 
Perrotte 

With 14 lemming members of the 200S- 
2009 squad, this year's key to success will be in 
experience. Included on this year's roster will be: 
Oliver Kook with I U blocks on fast &gt;«ais season, 
senior setter Corey Stewart, junior Dany) "Kill- 
Switch" Shank who led last &gt;'ear5 in kills, digs and 
serves. Dan Mader holding the top spot in the 
setting category, outside hitters h'an Matos, Phil 
Peterson, Jonathan Me&gt;fr, and Patrick Bluba ugh, 
middle blockers Corc&gt;- Frain and Chris Brigsoa. 
and Ubcros Garrett Biner and Patrick Pinto. 
'The biggest difference from last year is our 
team. We wer^ realK' inexperienced and young 
so it Vfas an upsetting season. 



even thougii we gained lots of knowledge about 
the game. Moving into lliJs year we did not lose 
many players from last year, so we will be able 
to continue where we stopped.* said senior Oli 
Kook. 

As the practices have been rolling along for 
a month now, the drills and skills have been 
intensifying. A normal practice is a breakdown 
of the three most important areas of the game, 
offense, back court defense, and blocking. 

Last year's Ubero and defensive specialist 
Mike Morici was added to Amie Ball's four man 
coaching crew. With an addition to this year's 
staff, as the team splits up into groups to work on 
their game, each area has its own specialist 

"Being able to work on isolated lechmcal skills 
in practice with differeni coaches will benefit us 
tiemendously once we manage to pui the pieces 
of the puzzle together to play good volteybaO.' 
commented Kook. 

One cotirt is controlled by Head Coach Amie 
BaU as he nms the team throu^ offeruive 
driUs. The second area led by Graduate Assistant 
Coach Morici giving the members a tun for their 
money with defensive drills like passing and 
diring,wfailecourt number three is beingcoached 
b&gt;- Penotte, passing on his knowledge about one 
of the hardest skilb in volleyball: blocking. 

'Practice is definitely more intense, but it 
forces us to learn how to play hard every point 
This mindset is what turns good pla&gt;'ers into great 
pla&gt;'ers.' added sophomore Phil Feterson. 'I think 



that if we all ptay hard and as a team, anytliing Is 
possible." 

With the new coaching strategics, the 
expectations for ihU year arc much greater than 
last years'. 

'The expectation each season \s lo win, 
simply put We need to understand a work eihlc. 
determination, sacrifice and team. If everyone 
can believe in our system and each other, we 
can achieve many things this season and (hat 
goes above and beyond winning and losing* 
explained Perrotte. 

Competing at the Final Four Preview 
Tournament in Rocfaesiet. NY last weekend, the 
VoUeydons came back with a win over Loyola 
University Chicago and losses to Nazareth 
College and Penn State University. 

'This tournament v/as not about winning 
or losing. It was about giving all our players a 
chance show what they got. so we know where we 
are standing at this point of the year. Our reason 
stans in January; we have more ihan a month left 
lo step it up,' said Kocik about the exciting ftve set 
victory last Saturday. 'It is great to see how much 
potential our team brin^ to the table, we only 
nevd lo learn bow to use it efficiently.' concludes 
Kook. 

The team is looking forward to next week's 
IPFW Inviiational. The VoUeydons will face 
Carthage. Quincy and Ball State this Saturday 
at Gates Spons Center.
