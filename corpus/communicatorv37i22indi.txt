Thursday, Feb. 22 - Chancellor 
Mii.fi.icl Wartell listened to concerns 
and ideas of students at the Chancel- 
lor's Chat in the Walb Student Union 
student senate room. 

About 17 students attended the 

Topics addressed during the meet- 
ing ranged Irom snow days, commu- 
nity involvement and food service to 
student e-mail and the Monopoly- 
styled Fort Wayne game, which has 
IPFW in the "jail" slot - although 
there technically is no jail listed on 
the board. 

Students discussed concerns over 
the IPFW e-mail system; problems 
included the "Russian roulette" of 
making sure a message gels through, 
the lack of memory in mailboxes. 
missing mail, hoses that register "al- 
most full" after little use and the dif- 
ficulty in coordinating WEBCT, my- 
ipfw and OASIS. 

Students requested more memory 
for the system; Wartell sate! he'd look

opening of the new music building. P alion and P rovidl

ORGANIZATION HELPS DIVERT STUDENTS' 
ATTENTION FROM MONOTONY OF ACADEMIA 



By Jessie Ruckman 

and 

Stephanie Samples 

The Indian a- Purdue Student Gov- 
ernment Association is responsible 
for many activities that happen on 
campus, yet students sometime over- 
look the members and their efforts. 

Many students do not have an 
awareness of all the work and effort 
that goes into many of the activities 
on campus. 

"I've heard that students aren't 
aware of SGA, but we try to do ev- 
erything we can to bring awareness 
We sponsor athletic events, put up 
banners and even run ads on the ra- 
dio," said Pat Shifley. Student Body 
Programming Director of SGA. 

"Students have to invest some- 
thing in order to know what's going 



The members of the 
branch include: Shay Stroik, Student 
Body President; Alicia Cripps. Stu- 
dent Body Vice President; Patricia 
Shifley. Student Body Vice President 
of Programming: and Aaron William- 
son. Student Body Vice President ol 
Finance. 

The executive branch is in charge 
of campus activities, ranging from 
Homecoming to Spring Fling and ev- 
erything in between. 

"We try to sponsor activities on 
campus that appeal to the masses, 
and we try to have 2 or 3 events per 
month," said Shifley. 

SGA brings comedians, speak- 
ers and events to IPFW, and there 
is always tree food at these events 
They focus on a healthy diversity 
ol program-, and recently they even 



^™* s 




sponsored a tiaii-gcnder speaker 
response to a need on campus. How 
ever, SGA is far from strictly 

"We understand that students 
number one job is to focus on 
es, but there also needs to be fun, and 
that's where we come in," said Shif- 
ley. "(SGA's) job is to focus 
.iii.l athletics, as well as to reta 
dents and help to create pride in the 
IPFW campus." 

Retention of students is a prob- 
lem that SGA is trying to help IPFW 
soke h\ offering fun events such as 
Homeuiniing ami Spring Fling. "Not 
mam students keep coming hack to 
school because ol die fun they had in 
a class, but some slay because the) 
feel tied in campus because of fun ac- 



tivities," said Shifley. 

SGA is in charge of organizing 
special events on campus lot students 
to enjoy, and is the programming 
branch of student government. 

According to the SGA website 
their mission is "to provide the stu- 
dent body with diverse cultural, edu- 
cational, recreational and social pro- 
gramming." 

Shifley added that the organiza- 
tion is always looking for new mem- 
bers, and there are many benefits to 
joining, including having a hand in 
bringing special events to students. 

If anyone is interested in joining 
SGA, they can go to Walb Union 225

serving (he campus. 

Subway was the lirsl franchise to 
open in ihe basc-meni of Keitler and it 
nourished. Pi/-/a Hut and Taco Bell 
were added following the success of 
Subway. 

However, with the opening of stu- 
ilcnl housing, there has been demand 
again tor a cafeteria. 

Some students also mentioned 
that the restaurants open on campus 
have limited hours, closing ill 5 p.m. 
weekdays and 3 p.m. on Fridays, ex- 
cept for Subway, which stays open 

until 8:00 pm. 

The expense of Pizzii Hut salad 
and limited variety ot food choices 
were also pointed out. Warlcll stated 
thai IPFW is contracted to work with 
the current restaurants until June 30. 
2010. 

However, if there is a significant 
demand for longer hours at the res- 
taurants, Warlcll surmised that they 
will stay open later. 

In regard to snow days. Wanell 



stated "Wc arc the last ones to an- 
nounce it (cumpus closing)." He ex- 
plained ihai the campus would only 
close in the event of a snow emer- 
gency or if Hie parking hits couldn't 
be cleared. 

Students indicated a desire to cre- 
ate pride in the school, but cited the 
difficulty of attending events due to 
class scheduling. 

The chancellor acknowledged the 
desire, but mentioned thai many stu- 
dents now have work and families, 
later classes arc the ones that students 
vote lor "with their feci," so those are 
Ihe limes scheduled for classes. 

As final nole on the Fort Wayne 
game. Warlcll said that IPFW had 
chosen to be put in thai particular 
slot, due to it's prominent place on 
the game hoard and its "big market- 
ing area." 

Students gave mixed reviews, 
some saying that it still was "jail," 
while others expressed approval lor 

promoting Ihe school. 



IU Bloomington bans smoking 

Is IPFW next to prohibit lighting up anywhere on campus? 



By Zachary Hunsinger 

Effective October of this year, 

sludentsat lU-liloominglon will have 
to leave campus to smoke. Previous- 
ly. IU respected ihe "30 feet policy." 
which incanl no smoking within 30 
feet of campus buildings. 

ID'S president. Adam Herbert, re- 
sponded lo a student proposal to ban 
smoking campus-wide, and assigned 
a lask force to review ihe proposal. 

The task force was headed by 
Dan Rives, associate vice president 
ol University Human Resource Ser- 
vices, and Richard McKaig. dean of 
students. 

Student government members, 



residence halls, and faculty and em- 
ployee groups comprised the task 

IUPUI and IU-Southeast already 

have smoke-free campus policies. 
Ill's new smoking ban permits smok- 
ing on public sidewalks, streets and 
homes that allow smoking. 

Last fall Purdue University up- 
dated their smoking policy to the 
common 30 feet policy. 

Carol Shelby, senior director of 
Environmental Health and Public 
Safely, said thai Purdue has not held 
discussions lo change their current 
policy. 

Currently students, faculty, and 
staff are remaining compliant to the 

This raises the question. Is IPFW 



in danger of a smoking ban? Imme- 
diately, no. Carol Shelby continued 
to comment that "implementing a 
new policy of any kind takes lime, as 
it is a change in behavior." 

Purdue's smoking policy only 
explicitly restricts West Lafayette. 
With no student proposals or com- 
plaints, and with students respecting 
IPFW's smoking policy, little change 
is expected soon. 

However, pressure continues on 
banning smoking in all public areas, 
not just on college campuses. 



IPFW facelift to continue until 2010 

More than half a dozen projects promise dramatic change 



The face of IPFW will he going 
through many changes between now 
and 20KI. The Music Building will 
be finished and ready lor classes by 
fall of 2007 and that is only the be- 
ginning, said Walt Branson, vice 
chancellor for Financial Affairs. 

There are more ihan half a dozen 
buildings and additions slated for 
completion by 2011). including more 
student housing, a Medical Education 
Building, the Saint Joe Rivei Bridge 
and a .Student Services Complex, 

By fall of 2007, construction on 
the new addition of dorms will be 
complete, adding almost 170 new 






Dines 



dents won't see any difference," said 
Branson. 

Even with the expansion of the 
dorms, only six percent of the IPFW 
population will be housed on campus 
when the newest dorms are coniplet- 
ed--sigmhcauth less ihan other uni- 
versities, but IPFW culture is chang- 

"Typically colleges have the ca- 
pacity to house about 25% of their 
students in dorms, but that doesn't 
happen overnight. We have to de- 
velop the culture of student housing." 
said Branson. 



Though housing is an issue, so is 
overcrowding in oilier buildings ,in 
campus. The completion of a Medi- 
cal Education Building and the Mu- 
sk Building will go a long way to 
alleviate crowding in the Classroom 
Medical Building. 

"Currently, medical education 
classes are held in the Classroom 
Medical Building on the third floor, 
and when the Medical Education 
Building is done, that space will he 
freed up for other services," said 

With the Medical Education 
Building's completion. IPFW will 
then be able to accommodate IU 
medical students lor one year, who 
will then attend lU-Bloonnngton be- 
fore returning to IPFW for their resi- 
dency Indiana University was suc- 
cessful in obtaining funds for the new 
building, which will be located next 
lo the Music Building. 

There is also another exciting cl- 
ement to the expansion of IPFW: an 
enabling park with sensory garden. 
"The park is uol just for people with 
disabilities, but will be open to the 
general public,' said Branson. 

The park will be located across 
the river from IPFW with access 
from a connecting bridge tentatively 
scheduled for completion in 2008. 
Die park will be accessible lor even- 
one, despite ability or disability. 

This parcel of land is currently 
leased to IPFW by Allen County, and 
there is roughly 65 years left on this 
contract. IPFW plans to use this land 



c'llicicnlly and effectively during this 
time period. 

'The sensory park will focus on 
all of the senses, including lasie." 
says Branson. The plan is thai edible 
plants such as mint will be incorpo- 
rated into the park, as well as certain 
plants with outstanding scents and 

Another feature ot ihe park is that 
wheelchair-bound people will be able 
to maneuver their way onto grassy 
areas with minimal or no assistance, 
lending an extra degree of indepen- 

"If someone ma wheelchair wants 
to sit on the grass, there will be raised 
lawn areas so that one could iu-i slide 
out of their wheelchairs and onto the 
grass." said Branson. 

The enabling park is not the only 
new feature coming up across the 

There will also be a Holiday Inn 
hotel built on that parcel of land, and 
Will have a classroom for hospitality 
management majors at IPFW, as well 
as a kitchen for Ivy tech's culinary 
arts students. 

The hotel is being built by Focus 
Development, a company out of Val- 
poraiso, Indiana.

merely making the wrong interpreta- 
tions when it comes to beauty. How 
should you know the right interpreta- 
tion when all the signs are iHiinling 111 
the wrung direction? 

Caring about image is important, 
How you present yourself with ap- 
parel is far more crucial than how 
you physically look. First impres- 
sions are key, and being insecure 
about your weight only shows your 
lack of con !i deuce, a trail 10 which 
people are sensitive. It you dress the

be broken, as long as you correctly 
understand and fulfill lliis idea. Ev- 
eryone is attracted lo a nice smile and 
a good sense of humor, 

Being interested in people and 
what they have to say is pertinent. 



We need to find it in ourselves to 
turn off some of the narcissism, stop 
thinking thai people really care about 
you and stiul caring about other peo- 
ple instead. 

It seems that losing or gaining 
weight is an attempt to gam approval 
front other people, who desire the 
same approval. If you're around peo- 
ple who create that tension by pro- 
jecting their insecurities, then some 
form of confrontation may become 
necessary.

unhealthy and poor examples of what 
physical beauty should he. There is 
a middle ground, and it has been said 
that wc need to stop thinking that all 
beauty is exterior. 

There is no perfecl body, and un- 
fortunately we cannot airbrush our- 
selves before we go out on dates or 
out for the night. We have to remind 
ourselves that no amount of crunch- 
es, runs or light lunches will make 
us look like the ladies on magazines, 
because even the ladies on the maga- 
zines don't look like that. 

There is nothing wrong with 
wanting to reach a healthy weight 
in a healthy way. bui it should be for 
your health. Life shouldn't start when 
we loose those live pounds: if that is 
how we live our life, we will spend 
the rest of our lives wailing for the 
next five pounds to drop. As help- 
ful hint, Marilyn Monroe was a size 
12. Good luck finding someone who 
thought she was too fat.

Oscar winning producer, writer, graces IPFW 






- Ileshe, 



I arrived ai Walbannovinulv earls 
on Monday. Feb. 19. Why? I was so 
anxious lo hear what Hobby Mores- 
co had to say. He was a co-producer 
for "Million Dollar Baby" and a co- 
wriler for "Crash," two of the most 
controversial lilmsoi their respective 
years. I figured that he would prob- 
ably stand high above everyone and 
lecture about the importance of toler- 
ance and his thoughts on the world 

Instead, within two minutes of be- 
ing on siage. he asked to si( in a chair 
next to the podium. "If I stand behind 
here (Ihe podium). I feel like I have 
to say something important," said 
Morcsco. 

He hud no intention of lecturing. 
He wauled lo talk to the people and 
toll them what they wanted lo know. 



and real as youi ncsi-door neighbor 
and as down to Larth as ,m Lnglish 
teacher. He answered questions 
and talked to people, because that's 
what he knows. He never pretended 
to have the answers to any social 
problems (actually, he Hal-out de- 



"He never pretended

med having ihe answers), hit! he is 
-onicone who wants lo explore I hem 
philosophically. 

With his tilmography as il cur- 
rently stands, everyone (including 
myself! really wanted to know what 
it was that made him the person he is 



Mh, I 



As his history unfolded through- 
out the lecture, il became increasing- 
ly clear why his films are as power- 
ful as they are. Take "Million Dollar 
Baby": a him about what it is "to be 
a champion." as Moreseo put it. The 
movie deals with a woman who is 
figuratively lighting from the begin- 
ning of her life on until 
she reaches ihe peak of

whole life to get lo 

where he's at today. He grew up in 
Hell's Kitchen, an area notorious for 
its violence and racism, and from

slruggled lo become a champion

I'm sure he won't have lo struggle 



Solutions 

for monetary system 

necessary 

By Michelle Yahne and we have single-handedly killed 

local commerce and economy for the 
convenience of cheap stuff. Have you 
noticed the meal ai those places isn't 
Ihe same quality you find at butcher 
stops'.' Or how if you buy electronics 
from some random place, they never 
seem to last? Or my favorite, how 
people go lo ihe reputable sources 
for information and ideas, then go 
somewhere else to actually buy the 

Even though I know 1 could get 

certain things cheaper at other plac- 
es, I want to give to ihosc businesses 
that worked hard for the money 1 
have (but I'm already not happy that 
I have lo have money). 

The other reason I hale money 
is thai whenever I seem to have it. I 
spend it, Physical money, that is. This 
is why I do not carry cash with me. 
When I have cash. I usually spend it. 
and then I end up with a ton of pen- 
nies that I can never seem to get rid 
of, no matter how hard I try. 

No matter how many eggs I trade 
away, my chickens will lay more 
again tomorrow. Son of like my own 
personal money tree. Do you follow 
me? Maybe I should turn my pennies 
in and melt them down for the cop- 
per. 1 know! 

I'll melt it down and make a cop- 
per plate out of it for my prinlmaking 
class. It costs less than buying one. 
and it is the exact same material! 

So we as a society should get 
rid of the paper money system we 
currently have, and come up with a 
heller solution, whether it be a bar- 
ter system or not. I mean, we're in- 
telligent people here and we can do 
better. Some things need improve- 
ments such as (echnology and trans- 
porlation, and some don't, like the 
wheel. The paper money system we 
have could use a few tweaks. Okay, 
maybe a lot of tweaks. So what are 
we waiting for? 



Trying lo gel rid of the dollar' 
Trying lo make it a coin'.' Why is all 
this causing so much debate' 1 I have 
an idea; let's throw money out the 
window and go back lo the barter 
system when if you needed some- 
thing, you traded something you had 
in order to get it. If you needed a 
chicken lo lay eggs to cat. you traded 
your craft, or milk from your cow, or 
somelhing to lhai effect, and every- 
one was happy. 

Call me a hippie, but it worked 
way back when, way back when ev- 
eryone was considered equal and we 
nil lived in a happier stale. Somehow, 
between (hen and now, status entered 
the picture, along with its friends 
ego, selfishness and vanity. Some- 
how, living well and sharing whai 
you had to get whal you need is not 
good enough lor some folks, but let 
me (ell you, it works for me. 

I'll trade you a painting if you to 
fix the leak in my sink. How about 
thai 'Whenever did one person's erafl 
start lo become better than another 
person's? Why is il that being good 
a! Using cars is any less valued !han 
being able lo run a computer? Why 
do people who invented flic I lapper 
make more money than the guy who 
discovered how io effectively cure 
stomach ulcers? Why can't thai sci- 
entist trade his knowledge lor (ickcls 
to a baseball game? 

Personally, although there are 
still problems with the barter syslem, 
just as wnh thieves, there will always 
be some more prosperous than oth- 
ers, bui for ihe most pan, everyone 
would be on a level playing held. 
Then you went lo the baker to get 
bread and the butcher shop for meat. 
Now we go to places like Meijer and 
Walmart for just about everything

Just like culture creates a wide

are important in order to keep from 
alienating individuals. God docs not 
look at us the same, he knows us 
enough lo know that we are individu- 
als. If we believe this, then we also 
believe thai He made us that way. 

The bottom line is, we are all in 
Ihe same boal here. There will come 
a day when we will find out if we 
were right. I will place my bet on 
love rather than alienation.

Anberlin unleashes 'Cities/ their newest masterpiece 




By Mike Webb

In 2002, Anberlin unleashed

masses, and since then [heir fan base 
lias steadily grown With often spiri- 
tual lyrics and a penchant for writing 
catchy music you can't quite fig- 
ure out why you like, Anberlin now 
carves a name for themselves as a 
soul guilty pleasure.

Basically, these guys turn melo- 
dies reminiscent ol elevator music 
into ones thai rock with ferocity. 

The release of their third full- 
length record "Cities" on Tooth &amp;

record to make it their most ambi- 

and mature release by lar. Many

However, the record is not en- muc

"Adelaide." the third track on

Bloomington pianist solos with Fort Wayne Philharmonic 



By Louisa Danielson 

Perhaps the first thing audiences notice 
about soloist Arnaldo Cohen are his powerlul 
hands. As he sits at the piano, his hands form 
chords of gargantuan volume, plowing effort- 
lessly through waves ol notes. This is commend- 
able in a pianist -■ hut it is especially unique in a 
musician who is also a violinist Cohen, whose 
background includes degrees in both violin and 
piano, also has i aim hi pin sic s and mathematics 
and is currently a professor of piano at Indiana 
University-Bloomington. 

Cohen performed the Brahms Piano Con- 
certo No. 1 in D-minor, op. 15, with the Fort 
Wayne Philharmonic on Saturday. Feb. 17 at 8 
p.m. in the Qmbass\ Theater Audience mem- 
bers thoroughly enjoyed Ins rousing rendition 
of the work. The first movement was serums 
and heavilj llavored with a Bcelliovenesuue" 
aura. The second movement was controlled, 
with a sweeter melody thai wandered through 
modulations and trills, accompanying a solo 
clarinet from the orchestra. The linal movement 
opened like a Bach fugue: however the heavy 



homoptioiik chords o! the opening evolved into 
a thrumming schotiisclic toward the end of the 

A standing ovation prompted Cohen to per- 
form an encore "Urahnis has sadness." he com- 
mented from the stage. "I'll play a tone piece 
based on themes of Strauss- Die Fleidermaus." 
These variations on familiar Strauss waltz mel- 
odies sparkled under his touch. Both judience 
and orchestra watched, fascinated, as Cohen 
raced through scales. His eas\ technique made 
the difficult pa-sages seem simple, mere exer- 
cises to be displayed before the audience. 

Also at this concert Elgar's "'Cockaigne'' 
Overture, op. 4(1. and Gmastcra's "Four Dances 
from 'Estancia'" op. 8a. were performed. 

The Elgar had a broad, full sound like that 
of the Olympic theme. First performed at the 
Queen's Hull in London in 1901. (his piece was 
designed to be a tonal description of Victorian 
London. The (erm '"Cockaigne" was demed 
from a medieval legend about a country of that 
same name, where ihere was no hunger or suf- 
fering li is thought that the British term "Cock- 
ney" is derived from the same word. 

"Estancia" was originally a ballet, choreo- 



graphed by George Halanchiiic In 
the style of the American "Rodeo. " 
"Estancia" tells the story of a city- 
bred man who goes to an Argentin- 
ean ranch and falls in hive with a 
woman there file ballet ends with 
a jousting match between the city 
dude .mil the ranch hands (gainfiosj 
as they compete for the hand of the 
lady. The evening's performance in- 
cluded lour dances from ibis ballet 
"Lo- trabajadores agrieolas" (The 
Worker- of the Land). "Dan/a del 
trigo' (Wheat Dance). "Los peones 
de hacienda" (The Cattle Men), and 
"Malambo." People of the audi- 
ence, from grade-schoolers to more 
mature people, seemed to enjoy the 
driving rhythms and atonal gyra- 
tions of the siring section. 

At the close of the concert. Con- 
ductor Edvard Tchtv/hel accepted 
several bows. Then the audience 
left to face the driving w md outside. 
filled with the warming notes of 
more friendly climates.

and their far-reaching effects on our lives. He challenges people to think 
about critical issues, including food safetv, workers rights, the war on drugs, 
our prison system, marketing to children, and the obesity epidemic. 

In ftlW Food Nation, Schlosser uncovers the inner workings of the fast 
food industry, from the appalling working conditions in American meat- 
packing plants to the "flavor industry" along the New Jersey Turnpike that 
gives last loud its taste Si.hlo.sscr reveals how fast fund has been a 
revolutionary tone in Amenun life, transforming our diet as well as our 
economy, workforce, and popular culture. 

In Reefer Madness. Schlosser examines three commodities that have 
defied government laws and fueled America s black market, which now 
comprises about Id percent of the overall cconoim i-'ocusingon marijuana, 
pornography, and illegal migrani workers, he charts the growth of the 
underground economy and finds its roots in the ingenuity, greed, idealism,

Equal Opportunity/Equal Access/Affirmative Action 



On March 5-11, IPFW students 
will have the opportunity to witness 
the fruits of Windsong \ labors first- 
hand with the "8th Annual Interna- 
tional Windsong Film Festival." 

Co-sponsored by IFFW Student 
Life and Windsong Pictures, the fes- 
tival will consist of a full-length fea- 
ture presentation, and multiple short 
films (both local and international), 
as well as an awards ceremony. 

The feature film, "Miehdimacki- 
nac: A Revolutionary Saga," is a his- 
torical film about the Revolutionary 
War. What makes this film unique is 
that it was produced hy Wmdsuny 
Pictures here in Fort Wayne, Indi- 
ana. Enlisting a cast and crew of over 
1,000 individuals, this is the type 
of undertaking seldom seen in Fort 
Wayne, and is worth watching lor its 
scale alone. It will have three show- 
ings: March 5 at 7 p.m.. March 10 at 
7 p.m. and March II at 1:30 p.m. 

The Windsong short films (local 
productions) will make up the bulk of 
the festival on March o and 9. March 
7 will consist of international shorts. 
and March 8 will consist of "Outlaw 
Trail," an American short about the 
descendent of Butch Cassidy. 

These films are all family-friend- 
ly, and attendance is encouraged. 
Don't miss the opportunity to expand 
your horizons through the intelligent 
use of motion picture production. 

Films and festivities will take 
place in Classroom Medical and will

dupivlcangcTs of themselves occa- 
sionally within the house, as well as 
why the house won't seem to let them 

The concept of a haunted house 
has been done to death. It is almost 
not scary anymore as a result of 

cheesy Hollywood depictions such as 
the remakes of "The Haunting" and 
"House on Haunted Hill." but "The 
Abandoned" shares very little- in 
common with those movies. For one, 
this movie is scary-very scary. 

The setting is dreary and exceed- 
ingly realistic, as well. It is so real, 
yet unfamiliar. There is no comfort 
to be found here at all. There is a 
scene where Marie has to walk into 
an old basement hallway. 

The ground is covered in wa- 
ter, the hallway is too long to see its 
end, she is surrounded by strange 
noises. This is scary because we all 
can imagine what this situation feels. 
Here it is amplified because we know 
something evil is actually going on. 

The acting is top-notch, and from 
relative unknowns, except for Roden 
in "Hellboy." These actors are not 
larger than life, and as a result, are 
easy to relate to. 

By the end of the movie, you may 
find yourself with questioning the 
ability of this force to orchestrate the 
meeting of die movie's two protago- 
nists. There arc those who believe un- 
answered questions hinder the enjoy- 
ment of this movie.

then again I am mi impressed by the 
atmosphere thai I may be showing 
too much grace. In truth, there are 
aspects here which don't make much 
sense, but I say just chock them up 
to the strong evil power at work and 
leave it at that. 

There is no reason to ruin the first 
scary movie that comes out in a long 
time by trying to play the devil's ad- 

If you watch this movie for what it 
is, especially with the mindset to take 
it seriously, it will scare you. It's far 
and away the best horror film I have 
n a while. Let's hope this movie 
spawns a few worthy ii

The men's basketball team was 
Imping in end iheir season at home 
ihis week by ex lending their 3-game 
winning streak io5. hosting Utah Val- 
ley Stale last Thursday and Univer- 
sity of Texas Pan Ameriean (UTPA) 
Saturday night. Unfortunately, that 
streak would he stopped short with a 
9-point loss to the Utah Valley State 
Wolverines (72-63). The Don's were 
able lo lum around Saturday and de- 
feat the Broncos from UTPA (82-64). 
which increased their wins this sea-

wins in NCAA Division I play. 

After losing by 30 points to the

ing losel Ihe record straight, but were 
denied a win. Junior Dewitt Scott led 
the Don's in scoring with 14 points 
including 2 baskets from behind the 
3-poinl line. Olliei players delivering 
outstanding perform antes for IPFW 
include junior guard Demetrius John-

throw line and freshman Jaraun Bur- 
rows, who scored 10 points durum his 
17 minutes in the game. IPFW trailed 
Utah Valley State (20-7) at half time

tain consistent possession of the ball,

Columbus, OH- The road was not 
kind to the No. 6 IPFW men's vol- 
leyball team tins weekend. After fall- 
ing to Ball Stale Friday mghl, IPFW 
dropped a 3- 1 decision to No. 8 Ohio 
Stale Saturday night in Columbus. 

The Buckeyes dropped the first 
sel 31.1-27. bin came back lo sweep ilk- 
next three 30-23, 30-27 and 30-22. 

A tight first set with 1 3 lies opened 
up for IPFW at 24-all when Ihe Buck- 
eyes committed lour errors, giving 
the 'Dons some breathing room. On 
a block by junior seller (jraydon Ai- 



two over the weekend to 
and No. 8 Ohio State 

nsworth and junior opposite Jason 
Yhost. the Mastodons look the open- 
ing game. 

In the second set, a service ace by 
Ohio Stale's Robbie Klein gave the 
Buckeyes a 26-20 lead. 

IPFW couldn't overcome .531 
hittinc by OSU and dropped the set 
30-23. 

OSU senior Dan Meskc came 
up huge in game three. Tied at 26, 
Meskc pounded down one of his 19 
kills and fired off a service ace to 
give the Buckeyes a sel point. OSU 
captured game three on a block by 
Dan Mathews and John Albertson. 

Ohio State had little trouble in the 
fourth set as the Mastodons hit only 



and play haul |o r us. 1-veryhody 
wauled lo send us out on a good note 
and that just lets us know how close 
we are as a team," said Carouthcrs. 

The Don's came out to a great 
start, unci after the first 3 minutes 
of play the Broncos (13-14) would 
never see Ihe lead again. Head coach 
Dane file was certainly pleased, say- 
ing, "That's something \

For the match, the Buckeyes oiil 
hit the 'Dons .276 to. 181. 

Mcske again led Ohio Slate (13

son was a wall in the middle wiih . 
solo block and 10 block assists. 

IPFW (9-3. 4-3 MIVA) was Ice

in the first half. We finally did it to- 
night. You could just see and feci the 
intensity like I've never seen, We've 
gol lo make every game as important 
as this game tonight." 

Though the seniors were hon- 
ored earlier in ihe night, il was junior 
guard Chris Perkins (22) who would 
prove lo be IPFW's top scorer with 
27 points, his career high. Together 
with I 7 poinls from Carouthcrs, who 
hit all 6 of his free throws, and 9 
points from Best, Ihe Don's dominat- 
ed the IliKir, hitting over 50 percent 
of all their shots. The team clearly 
learned llieir lesson Ihursday, and 
only allowed UTPA about half of the 
turnovers they gave the Wolverines, 

The win against the Broncos in- 
creased ihe Don's record to II, set- 
ling a new record for ihe program. "It 
is a very significant win, but we've 
got two more," said Fife. This week 
the men's basketball team will travel 
north to face both South Dakota State 
and North Dakota hoping lo increase 
ihat record even more. If ihe team 
plays the way they did Saturday, the 
Don 'scan be con In lent about handing 
both Ihose teams another defeat, the 
way they did when they faced them 
at home earlier this month.
