Students once again receive parking tickets for illegal parking 



Once again this fall, IPFW police 
ticketed around 75 lo 100 care on the 
firel day of school. 

11 is a yearly occurrence thai hapens 
every (all lo students trying to find 
available spaces in all the choice lots. 
As in past years, this impossibility 
resulted in students parking on the 
grass lo arnve in class on time. 

Although this year the problems were 
compounded by the rain and the con- 
stniclion work on Coliseum Boulevard, 
nothing was insurmountable. In 
describing that first week, Larry Gaff, 



IPFW's chief of police, said, "U wasn't 
terrible. It could have been worse, and 
it has been in the past." 

Last year, the umvereity added more 
parking spaces in a new lot near the 
Multipurpose Building. But, most 
students don't want to walk that 
distance to class, especially in the rain 
as on Aug. 26. 

This year. Gaff said, "We issued 
quite a number of tickets in only the 'A" 
loU," After ticketing cars parked in 'A' 
lots, tailing to display 'A' permits, the 
IPFW police moved on lo ticket cars 
illegally parked in the grass.

Gaff did take some preventative 
measures lo deter students from 
parking in 'A' lots, essentially faculty 
parking. "I did put signs up telling 
students not to park in lots 6 and 9." 
Lots 6 and 9 are both 'A' lots. 

Gaff also scheduled extra shifts the 
firel week of school. From B a.m to 5 
p.m. there were three officers on duty. 
Two officers were on duly in the 
evening. 

The police staff also employs six 
work study students this semester. 
These students assist the patrolmen by 
issuing parking permits and jump- 
starling cars. Presently they are 
learning to issue tickets. "At no time do 
they act in any police capacity," said 
Gaff 

There was one more parking problem 
this year with the advent of the new 
parallel parking spaces along Broyles 
Boulevard in front of the circle, near 
Walb Memorial Union Building. "The 
only other problem we've noticed iv 
people parking in the opposite direction 
of the flow of traffic," said Gaff. "You 
can't parallel park a car in that wav 
because it's illegal with city or 
dinance." 

Gaff is making plans to eliminate the 
problem of students parking in the 
grass. "I'm going to post signs 
periodically saying "Don't Park in 
Grass'." he said. 

"There's not much you can do," said 
Gaff, to alleviate that problem of 
parking on the lawn. People are paying 
lor permits and they don't want to park 
that far away iout by the Multipurpose 
Building! Kids don't want to be late for 
class," said Gaff.

Business department seeks its own accreditation 




George Bullion Is an associate 
professor and chair of (he department 
of business and economics. (Pholo by 
Mark Neu). 



By DEBORAH A. ST ARKS 
Chief Reporter 

Last April, the IPFW Division of 
Business and Economics learned of the 
decision by the American Assembly of 
Collegiate Schools of business to defer 
its accreditation tor one year. 

The decision by the AACSB did not 
change the division's present ac- 
credited status, having been previously 
accredited as part of the Indiana 
University system. 

The IPFW Division of Business and 
Economics had sought accredilation on 
its own. 

C^irrently only 240 institutions from 
among the more than 1500 degree- 
granting business schools in the United 
States are accredited. 

Those institutions in the state of 
Indiana are: Ball State, Indiana State, 



Indiana University, Purdue University, 
Indiana University - Northwest, In- 
diana University - South Bend, Noire 
Dame, and IPFW 

A report from an on-site visit in 
December 1984 by a three person team 
chaired by Dr. Robert Sandmeyer, 
dean of the Oklahoma State University 
School of Business formed the basis for 
the AACSB's decision action. 

In a letter announcing its decision, 
the AWCSB called for a year's end 
report on research productivity and 
faculty recruitment, both areas of 
concern raised during the evaluation. 

"If the division had been denied 
accreditation, il would have been for at 
least 3 years," said George W. M 
Bullion, chairman of Ihe division of 
business and economics at iPFW. 

"The AACSB key concern was ad- 



ditional doclorally-qualified faculty in 
management and accounting, and 
higher quality and quantity in 
research," said Bulhon. 

"To dale, the division has hired in 
accounting Dr. Max Laudeman from 
Western Michigan University; Dr. 
Admad Karim, in management from 
Northern Illinois; and the addition of 
three faculty members with extensive 
backgrounds in research," said 
Bullion. 

"Thedivision has also undertaken Ihe 
reallocation of its existing resources," 
said Bullion. "A quantity report will be 
filed with the AACBS in December. The 
issue of quality well be of concern. 

In Ihe meantime, the division of 
business and economics expects lo get 
Ihe official word on its continuing ac- 
creditation by next April 



Organization aims at spiritual needs 



By BRANDY MEYERS 
SI aff Writer 

As a member of this campus for 
about ten years, the IPFW Christian 
Fellowship Organization is one of four 
groupson campus whose aim is to meet 
the spiritual needs of students. 

At their open house, Wednesday, Aug. 
28, they offered a lunch along with a 
chance to meet the group's leadere. 
Literature was also available at the 
open house explaining the group's local 
and national goals The officers are 
Chuck Altheide, president. Don Langel, 
publicity coordinator and secretary; 
and Clare Crunk, treasurer. Professor 
Edward Messal acts as the faculty 
advisor. 

The fellowship has a new staff worker 
from the national organization. Scolt 
Harris. Sept. 1, he began commuting 
here from Muncie on a bi-weekly basis. 



IPFW Christian Fellowship is only a 
small part of a national organization 
called Inter-Varsity Christian 
Fellowship. This national organization 
is also a member of the International 
Fellowshp of Evangelical students. 

The purpose of the Inter-Varsity 
Christian Fellowship is to establish, 
assist and encourage groups of students 
at educational institutions across 
America who witness the Lord Jesus 
Christ as God Incarnate and have these 
major objectives: 

1 Evangelism: to lead others to 
personal faith in Christ as Lord and 
Savior. 

2 Discipleship: lo help Christians 
grow toward maturity as disciples of 
Christ, by studying the Bible, prayer 
and Christian fellowship. 

3. Missions: to present the call of God 



to the world mission of the Church by 

helping students and faculty to discover 
God's role for them. 

"As an interdenominational 
organiwlion." explained Altheide. "we 
put aside the minor differences from 
our background churches." 

On the IPFW Christian Fellowship's 
program this fall are three guest 
speakers, two multi-media presen- 
tations and a series of discussion 
groups. 

Some of the topics for discussion this 
month will be "The Bridge llluslralion" 
with Ed Messal on Sept. 11 and 
"Friendship Evangehsm" with Dave 
DeSelm of the Fellowship Missionary 
Church on Sept. 18. 

The group welcomes new members 
and all visitors. Meetings take place 
every Wednesday at noon in the Walb 
Memorial Union, suite 114.

Managing Editor 

Andrew Deiser, a junior ituijoring in 
Spanish at IPFW, left for Spain Sunday.

School graduate, was awarded an f 1100 
scholarship from the Spanish 
Associati(Hi of the Midwest, located in 
Chicago.

there, I might go lo Florence. Italy for a 
six week summer program." 

While attending the University of 
Madrid, Deiser will be working on 



finishing his bachelor's d^ree in 

Spanish. "Everything is in Spanish," 
said Deiser, "classes like language, 
literature, sociology, political science, 
art; there's no math and science." 

The association offers each year two 
SIlODscholarships to study in Spain and 
two S500 scholarships to study Spanish 
at an American University.

company your application. 

Deiser. who tentatively is planning lo 
return In the early part of next August 
to finish undergraduate school, desires 
to continue his education further in 
Spanish. 

"Eventually I want to get my Ph.D. 
and teach al the university level." said 
Deiser 

Deiser is leaving America with some 
basic goals he wants to achieve while in 
Europe. "I want to become fluent, be 
more fiuent tin Spanish) when 1 come 
back. Also 1 want to try and learn 
Ilaiian m the six week program," said 
Deiser "I also want lo get a good idea 



on what I want to study and do for

Banish the feud 



The battle of the Halfields and McCoys 
still exists even here at IPFW. There 
seems to be a growing battle between the 
old and new administrations of students' 
government. 

Members of the old administration are 
complaining about the lack of work done 
by the new administration over the 
summer months. 

The new administration is attributing 
some of their problems such as lack of 
involvement to an unorganized election 
last spring. 

Joe Motherwell, student body 
president, admits to the minimal 
amount of work that has been done. 
Motherwell said with the lack of time 
elected senators and student union board 
of governor members had over the 
summer, accomplishing goals has been 
tough due to busy schedules. 

Motherwell has even admitted to his 
own time problem this past summer, but 
his reasoning for a busy summer 
schedule was working full time during 
the summer so he could devote his full 
attention to school and the presidency 
during the school year. 

Although attendance at meetings has 



been low, SUBOG has arranged some 
activities for students. Weekly movies 
have been arranged, a co-sponsored 
lecture has been set up for Oct, and a 
concert at the Grand Wayne Center has 
been scheduled for December 

Unlike SUBOG, who only needs one- 
third of its members for a quorum, the 
senate has not been so fortunate The 
senate who needs two-thirds of its 
members for a quorum, never achieved 
this. 

Now the school year has begun and the 
senate has set some goals These goals 
include improving advising, expanding 
and reinstating the student discount, 
lobbying at the state level for a fine arts 
building and stopping tuition increases. 

But, none of this will happen unless 
students participate and back their 
students' government. A feud between 
administrations will get us nowhere, 

Combmed efforts — from everyone — 
will only work towards improving the 
life of IPFW. 

So let's begin to rfork and give this new 
administration a chance to prove 
themselves before we start casting 
stones.

President calls for more involvement

responsibilities and brings 



Commentary 



each one of us a step further 
into our college experience. 
IPFW IS a changing 
university. Anyone familiar 
with [PFW's recent past 
must be wonderously im- 
pressed with the physical 
campus growth: the 
Class room -Medical Building 
provided additional 
classrooms, lecture rooms, a 
lirel year medical sctiool 
program and breathing 
room for the Music and 
Liberal Arts Departments; 
the Multi-purpose Athletic 
Building is a tremendous 
leap from the tiny 
weight room once found in 
the basement of the Walb 
Student Union Building; the 
trailers ilroms) are gone, 
and in their place is the Geo- 
garden, spacious sidewalks, 
stone benches, and shrut)- 
beTy. there is the new CAD- 
CAM Computer Institute in 
Kelller, even some ad- 
ditional parking has been 
added 1 1 ) ; and ball 
diamonds and soccer fields 



exist where before there was 
Just a grass lot. 

Look for a new animal 
care facility soon, and pay 
attention! A stadium or Fine 
Arts Building may be on the 
horizon. I'm sure I've 
overlooked even other 
changes — IPFW is growing. 
We have over 10,000 students 
who should be proud of their 
campus and willing to be 
Involved in its evolution and 
direction. 

Which brings us to my 
poml: Students Government 
needs you. As a result of last 
spring's unorganized 
election process, Students 
Government is understaffed 
and help is needed. Our 
present membership in- 
cludes super people Each 
one has been involved 
throughout the summer as 
much as their other 
responsibilities allowed 
SUBOG has been par- 
ticularly busy and Student 
Senate is ready to roll; still, 
much is left to be ac- 
complished. 

The depth of our student 
programs and the timeliness 
of our actions are dependent 
upon the enthusiasm of the 
student body, as individuals, 
and their desire to t&gt;e in- 
volved Students Govern- 
ment should be judged — not 
by "armchair critics," but 
Judged by positive par- 
ticipants who are willing to 
hplD with improvements and 



constructive changes. 

Everyone is famiUar with 
the typical IPFW student's 
competing responsibilities: 
school, family, Job. and 
more. Where do you find 
lime for Students Govern- 
ment? Each of our members 
has numerous respon- 
sibilities Academics and 
jobs are number one 
priorities. As an 

organization, Students 
Governmentappreciates you 
and your time limitation. 



Our present members 
sacrifice personal time and 
full or part-time Jobs (myself 
included), so as to allow for a 
certain degree of Students 
Government commitment 

For yourself, think of both 
the valuable and marketable 
experience that you gain as a 
participant, think of the 
learning experience and the 
chance to satisfy that 
"altruistic you" demanding 
campus changes. Whewl 
Think about it!

Got an idea? Or have you 



noticed a wrong "that just 
ain't right?" Then join the

university administration 
asks tor "our" opinion and 
respects our student

OK, OK — enough, but

To the Editor: 

The article concerning 
student discounts in the Aug. 
29, 1985, issue of The Com- 
municator does not ac- 
curately explain the issues 
involved. 

In truth, tiie primary 
cause of the current 

problems concerning student 
discounts can l&gt;e directly 
traced to Don Gorney, the 
only mentioned source in the 
article Missing files and a 
lack of manpower are the 
two primary causes of the 
delay in processing and 
finalizing student discounts 
this year. A filing cabinet 
containing information 
pertaining to the student 
discounts, legal aid for 
students, and many other 
Students Governments 
activities was taken from 
myoffice the same week that 
Don Gorney finally removed 
the bulk of his personal ef- 
fects from the adjacent 
Student Senate workroom. 
The (lisappearance of the file 
at the same lime that Don 
Gorney was cleaning his 
things out may be only 
coincidental. 

By directly violating the 
time frame set forth in the 
Students Government 
constitution and by-laws 
while he was serving as 
Students Government 
president, he effectively 
reduced the amount of time 
that potential candidates for 
all offices were allotted to 
turn in completed petitions, 
furthermore, by appointing 
his friends and fraternity 
brothers to openings for the 



election board and the 
position of parliamentarian, 
and by not presenting these 
individuals to the student 
senate for its constitutionally 
required approval, he 
caused a shadow of doubt 
about the integrity of our 
electoral system to be cast 
over the whole process. 

The only way to l&gt;altle the 
damage done to the Students 
Government is with action. I 
have plans for on aggressive 
legislative agenda for the 
Student Senate this year. 
Spending £500 for an un- 
nceded button maker was 
the style of the Gorney 
Administration. This year 
there are important issues 
that must be addressed. 
While Don was making 
tiuttons, the fees for tuition 
that we all pay were in- 
creasing at an alarming 
rate. Effective, unified 
action backed by the vast 
numtier of students that 
make up our student body is 
the only way to stop tuition 
increases, to change the 
ineffective and inconsistent 
advising programs on 
campus, to get the Fine Arts 
Building built, and to ad- 
dre^ the multitude of other 
issues affecting the students 
of this campus financially, 
academically, and socially. 



We need to help clean up 
the messes and put out the 
fires left by the Gorney 
administration, then we can 
make real progress towards 
addressing the needs of the 
students at IPFW. Anyone 
interested in addressing 
these problems, or others, 
should contact Students 
Government. 

We have openings for 
senators, governors for the 
Student Union Board, and 
executive assistants. The 
Students Government can 
accomplish as much or as 
little as the student body 
desires If the Students 
Government effectively 
meets its goals, it does so 
because Students Govern- 
ment leaders have the 
support of the student tiody. 
If the Students Government 
fails to meet ils objectives, it 
does so only because the 
student body tolerates such 
failure. 

If all students on this 
campus are satisfied with 
the price they pay, ttie 
services they receive, and 
the conditions in which this 
exchange takes place, then 
we have nothing to worry 
about. However, in reality 
there is work to be done and 
the job requires everyone's 



cooperation

PIT'S influence reaches beyond IPFW students 







From "Sleps In Time,' un original musical conceived. 
dlrecUd. and choreographed last semester by Larry L. Life lo 
celebrale Iwenly years of theatre al PIT. Pictured are Erlka 
Tobolskl. ^landing, and Denise Van OrL i Photo courtesy of 
Department ol Communications and Theatre). 



Purdue Indiana Theatre 
opens the campus to the 
community, and it opens 
windows onto a universe of 
ideas, viewpoints, and issues 
for both its participants and 
its audiences. The theatre, 
now in its 20th season, also 
has contributed lo the 
quality of life in the Ail- 
America City of Fort Wayne, 
and has trained a corps of 
performers and technicians 
for community and 
professional theatre. 

And PIT is known for 
being, well, different, said 
Larry L Life, a PIT director 
and assistant professor of 
theatre at IPFW. 

Life's comment was 
echoed by 0. Franklin 
Kenworlhy. assistant vice 
chancellor and dean of 
academic services. 

■■What brought me here to 
oin PIT was, God knows,, 
no! the physical space, but 
that PIT set out to be an 
alternative theatre ex- 
perience," said Kenworlhy, 
who formerly was a PIT 
scene designer and chair of 
the former theatre depart- 

Asked lo assess the types 
of materials presented by 
PIT during its first 20 years. 
Life said: "My first word 



would be 'danng.' I think the 
one thing I've always ad- 
mired about PIT'S 
philosophy is that it's willing 
to take risks. Part of that 
may be fools rushing in 
where angels fear to tread, 
but I guess my philosophy is 
the bigger the risk, the more 
noble the failure. I think in 
my time here I've only seen 
that' happen a few times." 

PIT is different, too, 
because it exists in a 
university setting. 

"PIT is able to he free 
from the commercial 
pressures of other local 
theatres." Kenworlhy said. 
•'By and large that has held 
true over the years. We have 
been largely successful in 
balancing the theatrical 
scene in this community. 

"Because were an 
educational theatre, we have 
a process orientation that a 
more commercial theatre, 
which has to worry about the 
product and the box-office 
receipts that product pulls 
in, wouldn't have. It means 
that, in addition lo a product 
orientation, we also have a 
process (unction Thai's one 
of growth and education 
through doing. PIT has tried 
to be about that." 

Consequently, Life said. 



"PIT has raised the level of 
awareness about theatre in 
the community, the 
awareness that theatre is an 
art form and you don't just 
play al it. I think we also 
train audiences in what their 
responsibility is to the 
theatre." 

The cross- fertilization 
factor between the campus 
and the community shouldn't 
be ignored, Kenworlhy said. 



"We ha' 



vided 



more-trained cadre of people 
to work in community 
theatre. Al the same lime, a 
wide variety ol community 
people have worked here. 
These people give a different 
perspective lo educational 
theatre than students would 
receive on a more-contained 
campus. It's not a bad idea, 
philosophically," Kenworlhy 
said 

"We're exposing students 
to a world beyond the city 
limits of Fort Wayne. The 
value lo the community is 
the same. Neil Simon (whose 
plays are popuJar fare in 
community Ihealrel is very 
funny and probably one of 
our greatest contemporary 
playwTights, but he doesn't 



always open windows on life. 
We have a responsibility to 
choose material sometimes 
that doesn't please the 
majority, Ultimalely, 
theatre should wake people 
up and make them think," 
Life said 

PIT alumni also have 
made contributions to the 
larger world of professional 
theatre, although most are 
not household names. "Our 
success rate is really 
phenomenal," said Ken- 
worthy, who visited with 
several IPFW theatre 
alumni on a recent trip to 
New 'Vork City, 

Kenworlhy talked with 
more than a half-dozen 
former students: one a 
master electrician for Circle 
Repertory Theatre, one a 
stage manager for Off- 
Broadway productions, and 
several actors 

"What impresses you 
about our kids is that they've 
gone out and survived in the 
professional market No one 
had m^ga-bucks, but no one 
was out of work in a very 
lough environment." 
Kenworlhy said.

Spanish still lifes at Toledo Art Museum 



By KATHLEEN 

GREVEN 
Features Editor 

Spanish Still Life in the 
Golden Age: 160(^-1&amp;SO. the 
first international exhibition 
of Tlh century Spanish still 
life paintings ever held in the 
United Stales, opens Sep- 
tember S al the Toledo 
Museum of Art and con- 
linues through November 3. 

Toledo, Ohio, is only two 
houix from Fort Wayne and 
is host to the final op- 
portunity lo view this 
critically acclaimed 
exhibition. , 

John Russell, art critic for 
the New York Times, writes 
of the exiubition, "Not only 
are the paintings of the 
highest quality and distinc- 
lion, but many of them have 



a Ira need, timeless, 
monumental quality that we 
are pleased to think of as 
'modern' . Not to have this 
show in Ihe East New York) 
is a deprivation." 

Fealuring over 40 pain- 
lings, including master- 
pieces from the Musoe del 
Prado. Madrid, and the 
Museedu Louvre, Paris, the 
exhibition will show some of 
Europe's e;ir!iest and most 
inventive paintings of fruit, 
flowers, vegetables, sweets, 
silver and glassware. 

Such paintings, known as 
"slill lifes." were the first lo 
make everyday objects the 
focus of the painting itself 
rather than the elements or 
details within a composition. 

Relying on signed pain- 
tings and solid documen- 



tation, the exhibition and its 
catalogue are Ihe most 
thorough and reliable study 
to dale of ihose Spaniards, 
who, in the first half of the 
17th cenlury, created a bold 
new vision of reality that 
helped lo alter the course of 
art history 

The exhibition of these 
paintings focuses on the 
work of IS artists who 
created this important genre 
of painting. Not only are 
game, fruit and vegetables, 
flowers and sweets depicted, 
bul also sumptuous silver, 
glass and ceramics. 

Since no survey of Spanish 
life still exists in English, the 
scholarly catalogue ac- 
companying the exhibition is 
a major contribution lo art 
historical literature. 



No admission is charged to 
view the permanent 
collection, but $3 for adults 
and $2 for students is 
charged to enter this 
exhibition. 

The Toledo Art Museum's 
hours are Tuesday through 
Saturday. 9 a.m to 5 p.m. 
and Sunday 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. 
Remember thai Indiana is 
one hour behind Ohio right 
now. The museum is closed 
on Monday and free Wed- 
nesday. 

School groups and all 
accompanying adults will be 
admitted to the exhibition 
without charge if a tour is 
requested or advance 
reservations have been 
made for a self-conducted 
tour by calling the Toledo 
Museum ofiAct..-

Harriers top Division I 
teams to get season 
off to flying start

Thursday, Sept. 5. !■ 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 

Staff Writer 

The Labor Day weekend 

proved fruitful for IPFW's 

cross-country team, opening 



with 



im- 




pressive win. In a three team 
meet at Valparaiso, IPFW 
scored 25 points to defeat the 
host who racked up 44 
points, and Illinois-Chicago 
Circle, finishing with 66 
points. This victory should 
be particularly sweet, as the 
latter two teams are Division 
I schools. 

On the eight kilometer 
men's course, freshman 
Doug Sawyer ran a 27:59 to 
capture first place. Tom 
Hoffman, a senior, grabbed 
third place with a time of 
28:41. Fourth place went to 
freshman Pat Rice, clocking 
inat 28:46. To round out the 
lop ten finishers, 30:08 was 
Todd Eagen's time for 
seventh place, and Steve 
McNully earned a lOth place 
Tinish, with a time of 31:27. 

The two women cross- 
country competitors finished 
first and second in the first 
cross country event ever 
entered by IPFW women. 
Kristi Walker secured first 
place with a course record of 
19 31, Carol Van Horn 
finished second with a 21:27 
clocking on the five 
kilometer course. 

Coach Barrie Peterson, 
who is in his second year of 
coaching ai IPFW, has a 
positive outlook, because of 



I.M. sign up 



their first victory. 

"We'll have more depth 
this year than last year. 
There are more (runners) 
comprising the team from 
hard-working, championship 
high school teams," 
Pelorson said. 

Sawyer echoes the 
favorable thoughts of coach 
Peterson, "We should do 
fairly well this season I 
think we will be competitive 
at every meet." 

The Mastodons are a 
young team, but that hasn't 
hampered the team's depth. 
"Most of the team members 
are first year college run- 
ners. Only two runners, 
Hoffman and sophomore 
Rick Jereb, are returning 
from last year's team," 
Peterson said. "But we're 
making progress, and 
moving in the right direc- 
tion. It seems easier to en- 
force the idea thai with hard 
work will come success." 

As far as the conference 
race is concerned, Peterson 
believes that IPFW will be 
successful, "Last year we 
finished 5th in the con- 
ference. I think this year we 
will be in at least the upper 
division (in the top four out 
of eight teams.]" 

Peterson said, "The team 
to beat I in the conference! is 
Southern Indiana. Ashland 
will be very competitive as 
well." 

The Mastodons' next meet 
is the IPFW Hokum-Karem 
Saturday. 



People interested in 
participating in intramural 
basketball or coed volleyball 
can sign up now at the 
athletic center. 

Both sports will begin play 
during the week of Sept. 23. 
with basketball tentatively 
scheduled for Monday 
nights, and volleyball for 
Tuesday nights. Play will be 



on those nights for the enlire 
semester. 

Those interested in in- 
tramural racquet ball and 
billiards are to sign up Sept. 
16. also at the athletic center. 

For more information and 
sign up sheets, check the 
Intramural Bulletin Board 
located on the first floor of 
the athletic center.

Depth, youth for cross country 



The Indiana University- 
Purdue University at Fort 
Wayne (IPFW) Cross 
Country team roster reads 
like a who's who In Fort 
Wayne distance running. 
Second year coach Barrie 
Peterson has assembled a 
group that includes two 
njnners from last year's 
semi-slale qualifying team 
at Snider High School as well 
as several others who have 



made their mark locally. 

The lop catch could be 
Snider's Doug Sawyer. 
Sawyer was Snider's No. 2 
runner and helped lead the 
team to sectional and 
regional championships and 
a berth at semi-state. He will 
be joined by Jeff Salay, 
Snider's fifth runner. 

Peterson won't have to 
totally rely on new faces this 
year. The Mastodons return 



four-year veteran and 
captain Tom Hoffman, and 
Rich Jereb is l&gt;agk for his 
second year after coming oft 
a four-year enlistment in the 
marines 

The rest of the team is 
made up of newcomers, out 
for their first year of 
collegiate cross country 
competition. 

"We will have a young 
team, but we should also 
have some depth and a lot of 
ability," Peterson said 
"Although we have only two 
returners, we still have some 
maturity on the team since a 
lew of the runners have been 
away from the sport for a 
year or so. 



"IPFW IS beginning to 
attract some of the lop area 
runners, particularly from 
Snider and Northrop high 
schools. 

Joining the Mastodons this 
year will be Todd Eagen and 
Steve McNulty of Bishop 
Dwenger; Jeff Messman of 
Heritage- Bob Swinehart of 
Churubusco, and Steve 
Voitlein, a former Snider 
runner. 

Rice and Widdifield may 
be the best of the group, 
based on past performances. 
Rice earned all-state honors 
in high school and was a 
three- time all-conterence 
and all-area pick.
