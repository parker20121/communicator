Finals Week 



Staff Editorial 



Someone once said that 
"Hell is the impossibility of 
reason." Apparently, that 
person never had to go though 
finals week. 

As we all hunker down, brace 
ourselves and batten down the 
hatches in preparation for the 
last week of classes, we must 
remember that it will all be 



.Hell, as it v 



', will 



pass and we will awake the 
next morning, regenerated, 



ready to. tackle the world and 
most likely hung over. 

To all of the professors out 
there who will make their 
finals harder than an IRS Tax 
Audit, you can't keep us down! 
We have beaten you again! 
We've made it through the 
fall and are cruising into the 
spring, can you dig it? 

This being the last issue of 
the Communicator, it must go 
on record to say that finals 



are nothing but a burnp in 
the road, the monkey in the 
wrench, the proverbial "pecker 
in the woods." 

So sit back and relax, one 
and all, enjoy your Christmas 
break and New Years, REALLY 
enjoy New Years, and come 
back to us, ready to attack the 
books, ready to fight in the ivy 
covered halls of academia and 
ready to do the same damn 
thing all over again.

Emergence of a modern-day Hitler 



Trade Mark 



"White people wain

it is part of their plan. 



. H. Kambron taught African;.! 



Honestly, i don't know what is 

worse, the fact that his speech mirrored 
terminology from Nazi Germany, or 
that he spoke of racial genocide when 
the event was labeled as "Hurricane 
Katrina and Issues Facing African 
Americans" when it aired on C-SPAN 
last month. 

In the speech, there was no direct 
mention of the disaster that rocked 
New Orleans, but mention of a war, 
and it wasn't referring to Iraq or 



his belief that there is an ongoing war 
between die so-called white people" 
and "black people." 

According to Carolina Journal 
Online, a spokesperson from NCSU 
informed the publication, "the 
school has no listing of Kambron as a 
professor." However. CIO stated that 
as of Oct. 21, Kambron was on the 
faculty listing. He was also found to 



black history and culture. 

Since when does a college degree 
give a person some sort of authoritative 
mandate to call for racial genocide? 

Kambron is exactly the reason why 
extremist groups still exist in a country 
that has more ethnic diversity than 
arguably any sovereign nation in the 
world. The fact that he offered up a 
"solution" to the problem that called 
for the purging of "white people" 
[and I can only assume he means 
Caucasians) makes him sound like a 
modern-day Hitler. 

There have been" many counter 
arguments I have found, in blogs and 
various postings on the web, that 
the solution Kambron speaks of is 
a method of self-defense for black 
people throughout the world. 

That's a bunch of crap. 

I would no sooner condone a Klu 
Klux Han meeting that spouted a 
similar proposition, regardless of 
ethnicity. This is just wrong. Racism 
and any entertaining of thoughts 
about genocide, or any kind of race- 
based violence is counterproductive 
to society as a whole. Is this the type 
of teaching that the American people 
want fed to impressionable 18 to 22 
year-olds? 

1 would argue that most respectable 
professors and collegiate faculty have 
both the obligation and responsibility 



violence and anarchy. 

Kambron spent 
expounding upon his view about 
slavery, and the events surrounding 
the American Civil War. 

"When white people came to us 
and i; lid , " We're going to free you. We're 
going to emancipate you from the 
plani.it ion.' what they did was extended 
the boundaries of the plantation and 
made it an international plantation." 
Kambron said, "They made us think 
that we were free. In addition to that 
they made every white person on earth 

He was even absurd enough to 
accuse black people of being in an 
"international prison," despite die fact 
that he provided little substance to his

in his disturbed mind. It's also quite 
ironic that his solution is the same as 
the very "plan" he claims is operating 
against his "people." 

There were also claims that the 
war he speaks of is being fought in 



our own system, and stop playing and

from coming up with a solution to

planet is white people."

Dont forget the lessons of Katrina 



UWire Column 



(U-W1RE) AUSTIN, Texas - It seems our 
country, or at least our leaders, are determined 
to forget the lessons we could've learned from 
Katrina in the images of poverty and desperation 
we, as a nation, witnessed Some would have us 
continue to be only vaguely aware with that side 
of our country. 

I say we take a minute to return again t 
that week when we watched those who lacked 
the means to escape the chaos and squalor on 
the ground in New Orleans. Put yourself in the 
position of being one of the tens of millions in 
this country who, like those unfortunate souls 
left at the Superdome, are figuratively trapped in 
a different type i&gt;l prison I Enid lliose thoughts in 

your head for a minute. 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the 



presided over a rising poverty rate every year 
since taking the reins in 2000. List year alone, 
1.1 million people slipped below the surface and 
became poor on Bush's watch. 

So when our president stammers out that 
his tax cuts are working and need to be made 
permanent, I can't help but wonder who they're 
really working for. While millions are falling 
behind in this, the most powerful and prosperous 
nation in history, our president is insisting mi 
handouts for the very wealthiest among us. 

What's more, the whole "trickle-down" 
argument, apart from simply being poor 
economic logic, is getting old. 

The fact of the matter is, the gulf between the 



put off voting on setting Bush's tax cuts in si one. 
In the costly aftermath of that storm •■ both 
financially and politically - the GOP didn't 
want to appear to be starving national coffers, 
a potential political liability in the upcoming 
midterm elections. Instead, they waited a few 
months for the masses' attention spans to wander 



' and "have-lots." Such i 

n the population, and don't bode well 
ir us in a century where national cohesion may 
e the deciding factor in whether we maintain 
ur nation's current global leadership role. 
After katrina, Republican leaders in Congress 



have stealthily r 
congressional agenda. 

But wait, there's more. Congress is also set 
to vote on over y'lti billion in budget cuts in the 
upcoming weeks. Child support enforcement, 
student loans, health care and food stamps 
for the working poor are all up on the GOP's 



student loans that I and millions of othercitizens 
rely on to get our education and Inriher weaken 
our already emasculated health care system II 
I hey get I heir way. all these savings will he passed 



on, in the form of capital gains and dividends 
tax cuts, to our highesi income brackets. For the 
wealthiest 1 percent of this country, it may be 
a very merry Christmas indeed. An average of 
$51,000 in taxes saved per wealthy household, 
and to all a goodnight! 

Thus, after feigning enough concern for the 
cameras, President Bush and the Republican 
Party continue to ignore the needs of those 
sweaty, downtrodden faces that crowded out 
television screens a few months ago. Yet If you, 
like me, can't forget those harrowing daya when 
the veil between us and them was lifted for a 
moment, take a minute to call or write your 
congressman or congresswoman, and tell them 
that you know what's really going on and that 
you're not going to stand for it. 

At the very least, stay aware and informed of 
this deplorable charade, in the hopes that one 
day we have a president and a ruling majority 
that actually care about the least fortunate and 
are not content to merely pay them lip service to 
temporarily save their conniving hides. 



Happy holidays and one final farewell 



Simply Ludicrous 



This is my final column bn i lie (.on in nn in ator. Thank you loyal 
readers (if there were any). I had three main themes to my columns 
this semester; don't judge anything too quickly, Mastodon overkill 
is a bad thing, and watch out lor c apitalists. I hope you enjoyed my 
columns as much as 1 have. 

My final column is a letter addressed to one Reverend Jerry 
Falwell. If anyone has access to Mr. Falwell, please deliver my 
letter. Mr. Falwell has been rather enraged over the now common 
practice of referring to Christmas trees as Holiday trees. I hope he 
sees the letter, I think it might help. 



n (with maybe a lalwelloi iwn spmikled throughout). 
saw you on the FOX News Channel last week Jerry. Up 
r the Bostonian celebration of the holidays, you 



threatened litigation against anyone misinforming the public 
about Christmas. Tell me lerry, what is the correct information 

about Christinas'' Von r version, and your version alone? 



Oh, that's right, now 1 remember the part in the Christmas 
story when Joseph and Mary hand the little baby Jesus off to the 
shepherd so they can trim the tree. Yeah ... wasn't Joseph stringing 
up popcorn as Mary gave birth? C'mon Falwell, pull your head out 
of your ass. Next you'll be claiming that Santa was a wise man and, 









tree is ludicrous. You should know as well as I do that 
boughs were Pagan symbols of fertility that Christians, after much, 
much, much early condemnation, adopted for what 1 like to call, 
recruitment purposes. 

Your revolting suggestion that secular forces have hijacked 
Christmas is equally ludicrous lerry, that's just our friend capitalism 

Jerry I do, however, believe the notion that political correctness 
will somehow convince Jews to abandon the menorah or those 
observing Kwanzaa, a celebration stemming from Africa where 



when it has no bean id: on dien holiday, is absurd. 

The joy and cheer of this yearly rite has dissipated to the poini 
where even brightened trees .wu\ smiling elves and eight days 
candled illumination and symbols of African community make 
no alteration in the attitudes of the masses. We instead huddle 
in our homes and gorge ourselves on items of splendor and 
insignificance. 

For that reason, I think you are correct, ferry, in your struggli 
to keep the trees decorating the majority of our nation so named. 
It provides some bit of significance to a period of relative triviality 



Nevertheless, Merry 
tbulous Kwanzaa.

layer of sounds; this track includes some female vocal 
loops, and an almost Spanish sounding electric guitar 
in the background. 

The entire album seems less inner city and more 
southern California, with a possibly more Jamaican 
type feel. "Shottas" feaiLiringCam'ron and Sizzla proves 
the point with exotic vocals dial ahnosi seem reggae. It 
is definitely one of the highlights of "What the Game's 



sound. One track that ibis abi

"Make it Work For

and also known as " Ihe VVhislle Song" is characterized 
strongly by a whistle.

Random Rants and Thoughts 

Ask Skip Hooligan 

sports@ipfwcotnmunicator.org 



Well folks, I was going to wait to do this article after the first of 
the year, but a lot of stuff has come to the attention of good ole' 
Mr. Hooligan. So this will be an early "State of IPFW Athletics" 
address. 

This quite possibly might he my last article (a collective sigh 
rises from the Gales Sports Center), so I don't really care who I piss 
off. 1 just hope things change. 

People migh i think I h.ive.i huge eeiuleiui against IPFW and the 
athletic department, but I don't. T just want to see us thrive, and we 
are a long way from being there. 

For what it's worth. enju\ the rant, and possibly the memories. 

Rant No. I: The State of IPFW Athletics. 

Hmmm...where to start. In this rant, some programs will be 
spared, actually a lot. But there is one that Skippy is extremely 
pissed off at: the men's basketball program. And this has nothing 
to do with the players either. Skip is personal friends with most of 
them and has the utmost respect for those guys. 

Now, I have respeel foi the men's u&gt;Hi \b.i!l program and coach 
Arnie Ball. I have the same respect for the women's volleyball 
program and coach Kelly Flartley-Hutton as well. These are by far 
our two most successful programs. 

But as I wrote in a previous rant, we are a volleyball school that 
has a basketball problem. Now, you may ask yourself, "Skip, what 
is that problem?" Well. I intend to answer it. 

It all comes down to the larger-than-life ego that resides in the 
upstairs offices of the Gates Sports Center. We apparently have a 
coach that doesn't like criticism. Newsflash, no one does. Hell, you 
can probably point out many ihings wrong with this article each 
week, but you know what:' I hat just makes me want to make it 
better the next time around. 

Now, a few weeks back I wrote a piece on if former Interim 
Coach Joe Pechora was Mill here, what the makeup of our team 
would be, compared to this year's roster. Now, before I go any 
further let me say that 1 have NO problem with any of the players 
on this year's team, I will feed them some compliments later on. So 
let's get one thing straight; this is not meant to bash any of them. 

Well, that article didn't sit well with the new coach. You know 
what? OH WELL. I'm not here to kiss ass, that's not my job. This is 
an OP-ED piece. It's my opinion and mine only. If you don't like it, 
don't read it. Last time I checked, your job was to win games and 
mold these young guys into men, not worry about what one guy 
in a paper says. 



I've also given this , oath credit throughout the season so far. 
Will he be a good coach? Yes. Will he probably be at a bigger school 
sooner rather than later? Yes. Will he lead IPFW to a winning 
season?Who know-. Ml I know is ih.n he will be a good coach, if he 
isn't one already. But from what I've heard through the grapevine 
is that he doesn't like negative press. Well, that's a pan of life, my 
friend. I don't like getting bad grades in college, but you know 
what? If I get one, I probably deserve it. lust because you came 
from the land where your crimson shoes were kissed on a regular 
basis doesn't mean you are going to get that treatment here. 

You have to remember something: we have no tradition here, 
none at all. We are used to losing, .iml losing .., lot You think this is 
bad? Wait until you hit ihe big lime, it wont gel any prettier. 

Rant No. 2: The Atmosphere still stinks 

The game atmosphere cannot get any worse. It's so bad I don't 
know if I can go to many more games (yes I can, as long as the beer 
still flows). It's so bad I had to ask a member of the Blue and Brew 
Crew on how they leel, just to get my point across. He wanted to 
hide his name, so we will call him " Ihe Schwab." 

Skip— How long have you been coming to the games? 

The Schwab— Ever since they turned D-l, I am one of the 6-10 
die-hards that have never missed a game. 

Skip-Why do yon come to IPFW mens basketball games? 

The Schwab--- The number one reason I am at the game is to 
drink and hang out with the Blue and Brew Crew! And to watch our 
players; they play their hearis out every game. 

Skip-What is the biggest thing lacking in your opinion at the 
games? 



the fans a

Skip--If you were running things, what would you do 



,t of all, nothing against Fife, he will be a great

Skip— Yes. 
The Schwab— I thin

Skip-Are you surprised that despite Dane Fife's hiring, 
attendance hasn't picked up? 

The Schwab---! am very surprised, but that just shows you that 
you are correct in saying that we are a volleyball school with a 
basketball problem. It just proves that winning some games puts 
people in the seats, and by that I don't mean beating teams like 
Marygrove College. Who has ever heard of the (JsCAA? You need 
to get big names to play at home, maybe we can steal one against 
Notre Dame on the 18th. Plus, getting into a conference would be

The Schwab-

better fit for IPFW File will produce lor us, but once something

hired him without coaching experience. We are just like Fife's lab

Word Association 

Cheerleaders- -We have Cheerleaders? 

The Band- Hurts my ears. 

Blue and Brew t re w- For the amuum ol students in it, probably 
the loudest student section in college basketball. Nothing better 
than us taunting the other team. 

MIA (Mastodons In Action)— non-existent (we tried and no one 
supported us, it is to be disbanded). 

The Danger Zone song--- Ihe HOs called, they want their song 
back. Come on, let's have a di Herein player each week pick an intra 
song. I'm sure that song gels the govs hype io i ome out of the gate 
and make a statement. Maybe it they weie flying an F-14 with 
Maverick and Iceman. 

Kids Slam Dunk Contest- Most entertaining activity they 
have during timeouts. Don't know if thai means it is good or not, 
everything else is just lame. 

Closing Thoughts 

The Schwab — I'm not going to lie, with two wins already, 
I would call this season a success. After watching us lose to 
Huntington College in our exhibition game, a lot of us thought that 
we were heading in the direct ion of Savannah Slate, who went 0-28 
last year. But, my final thought is, how do you cut a Mr. Basketball 
from your team? Do not worn (.hiinim Hiulci. I am sure you will 
gel the last word. 

Rant No. 3 ---Commentary 

I Tivo'd the game against Marygrove College last Saturday, 
mainly because I wanted to see what it is like on TV. We have Kent 
Hormann doing the radio commentary, but I think he needs to 
be off radio and on IV. Randy Schiflman is the worst color guy in 
history. HeactualU was keeping track of how many times Hawkins 
was on the floor (luring that game He is the reason I can't watch 
News Channel I T&gt; sports, unless llrad Brown is on there. We have

All in all. Saturday for the 
Mastodons was a beginning and

yet well played couple of games 
and the beginning of a potential 
winning streak before coming 
home to face Notre Dame on 
Dec. 18. 

"We have three games 
coming up: two on the road and 
two in four days," Scott said. 
"To start off on a good note is 
always important. It helps the 
team's confidence and gets our 
morale going."
