Waynt 

kicks off on Nov. 13 with the theme "It's 

A Fort Thing." 

There have been a number of ques- 
tions pertaining to the theme "It's A Fort 
Thing." So, how exactly did the home- 
coming committee and SAB come up 

"We are playing Indiana State and 
we wanted to recognize that we are from 
Fort Wayne," said Pat Shifely, head of 
the Student Activities Board. "How ev- 
erything came about was centered around 
being from Indiana." 

The theme will carry on throughout 
the week. Monday's theme will be "It's 
A Tip-Off Thing" with the basketball tip- 
off game taking place later that evening 
at the Memorial Coliseum. 

Tuesday's theme is "Eats A Food 
Thing." with fares from Fort Wayne- 
based companies. 

"We will have Coney Island hot dogs, 
hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Seyferts 
potato chips and Archway cookies." said 
Shifely. 

Wednesday will consist of Krispy 
Kreme Donuts (10 a.m. until II a.m.), 
a sundae bar (11 a.m. until 2 p.m.) and 
Cookie Cottage cookies (5:30 p.m. until 
8 p.m.), all revolving around a theme of 
"It's A Sweet Thing." 

Thursday's theme will be "It's A 
Party Thing." Free pizza wilt be served 



ting the hog and Billy Elvis and the Has- 
Beens providing entertainment 

On Friday, IPFW will have a fair on 
campus from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. re- 
volving around tiie theme of "It's a Fair 

"I have three vendors who are com- 
ing. One will have elephant ears (a.k.a. 
"Mastodon ears"). The other two will 
have gyros, brats, pulled-pork and chick- 
en sandwiches," said Shifely. 

Friday will also feature a clown and 
the IPFW mascots, who will be handing 
out Mardi Gras beads. 

Campus Ministry will be handing out 
popcorn in Classroom Medical, Campus 
Scouts will be in charge of nachos and the 
Pharmacy Club will be distributing slush- 
ies. There will also be a caricature artist 
in Walb Union. 

Sunday will be the wrap-up day, with 
the homecoming basketball game. There 
will be a pre-party from 1 p.m. until 3:30 
p.m. in the Memorial Coliseum's Ap- 
pleseed Room featuring Unlikely Alibi. 
There will also be free mini cheeseburg- 
ers, fries and brownies, in addition a cash 
bar with blue margaritas and pina cola- 
das. Afterwards, the game against Indi- 

"Homecoming is a big deal," said 
Shifely. "It builds community and sup- 
ports our athletes."

Those interested in participating can 
take their items to Walb Union Circle 
Drive, where the trailer will be parked 
and packed with donations from 9:00 
a.m. to 5:00 p.m. each day of the drive. 

"Non-perishable foods are prob- 
ably the greatest need we have," said 
Audrey Moore, assistant director of 
student life. 

"We'll also take gently used cloth- 
ing, toys, coats., and hygiene items. It 
all goes back to the community." 

Donations will benefit the Second 
Harvest Food Bank and the United

The Second Harvest Food Bank is 
a U.S.-based hunger-relief organiza- 
tion that distributes grocery products to 
those in need, while aiming to increase 
awareness of dome-lie hunger. 

The United Way, a chain of chari- 
table organizations across America, - 
gels communities involved in solving 
significant social problems by combin- 
ing financial and human resources. 

In 2005 alone, "Stuff the Semi," 
which is held each year during home- 
coming, collected 735 pounds of food. 

According to the Second Harvest 
Food Bank, that amount is enough to 
feed seven families, or 28 people, for 
one month. 

Moore estimates that approximate- 
ly 50 boxes of non-food items were do-

Moore hopes to sec students and 
faculty turn ouc to help the community 
and get involved in the activities of 
homecoming. 

"It's just a great opportunity for 
IPFW students to give back to their 
community," she said. "All of their do- 
nations will stay here locally, and it's 
really a lot of fun."

Panel Addresses Veteran's Struggles 

Four former soldiers spoke of adjusting to civilian life after the war 



A soldier's mind-set is lo 
follow orders and do what is 
instructed by superior officers. 
When a veteran has completed 
their time with the armed forces, 
they must transform that mind- 
set back into civilian mode. This 
change can be a very difficult 
one with which to cope. 

On Nov. I inWalb 114, four 
veterans held a panel discussion 
to discuss the changes in mind- 
set that soldiers must endure 
when returning to civilian life. 

The IPFW Affirmative Ac- 
tion Committee held the event, 
which was moderated by Ken 
Christmon, associate vice chan- 
cellor for multicultural affairs. 

This discussion included 
Warren Cartmcl, Alicia Cripps, 
Al Perez and Hugh Reusser, 

form of the armed forces. 

Each panelist answered 
questions concerning the daily 
struggles they faced when re- 
verting back into civilian life. 



Al Perez served two tours 
in Vietnam and said, "'Return- 
ing home was a tough time, but 
what I struggled with the most 
were the marches protesting the 
war. Those people had no clue 
what was really going on and 
they were acting out against it." 

Perez said that one of the 
things he docs to help those also 
struggling to return to regular 
life is buy them a lunch. 

"If I am eating somewhere 
and there is a Marine eating 
nearby, I ask the waitress to 
give me their lab and tell her to 
leave them with a message stat- 
ing 'Semper Fi'." 

Cripps explained her tran- 
sition by stating. "Converting 

was a lough time for me. I had 
a job as a waitress and it both- 
ered me that when someone was 
told to do something, they took 
their time or did it halfway, That 
seemed to counter everything I 
had been trained in the past few 
years and look some time to ad- 

Reusser spcnl several 



months in Iraq and explained, 
"ll was a very tough time for 
me, and sleeping was one of 
the biggest adjustments. It 
actually fell weird for me to 
wake up and not hear mortar 
fire. That seemed almost scary 
at first, so being in a peaceful 
home set-ins foreign." 

Rcusser's situation is a 
common occurrence for many 
young men and women return- 
ing home from the war in Iraq, 
who have become accustomed 
to living in a hostile environ- 

Cartmel, a civilian soldier, 
slated, "ll was 

mc to return from Iraq and 
transition back into a normal 
mind-set. As a guardsr

Focusing on Celebrities in the News 
Serves as Escape From Real Life 



Celebrities + Juicy News = Rabid 
Public. Period. Al least that's how it 
works for me. 

I mean, is there any other possible 
reason as to why I care about Reese 
Wilherspoon and Ryan Phillipe's dis- 
solving marriage? Or why Brange- 
lina's lack of marital commitment af- 
fects me? (I can actually answer that 

They once said that they wouldn't 
marry until gay marriage is legal. As 
a lesbian, that one totally affects me, 
right? Yeah, I didn't really think so ei- 
ther. Their position on equality isn't 
going to make Bush ... ex. Congress 
... rush to legalize it. But it's a nice 
thought.) 

What about the fact that Vanity 
Fair— and the millions who purchased 
the magazine— are the only ones to 
have seen Suri Cruise? Or Madonna's 
latest adoption scandal? 

There's absolutely no reason on 
this earth why HI' ole me, in corn-lovin' 
Fort Wayne, Indiana should even be 
thinking about the aforementioned ce- 
lebrity gossip. 

There's actually no reason why 



anyone should. And yet we do. We 
all— and I'm definitely lumping myself 
into this category— run out to buy the 
latest rag off the stands in an effort to 
see just how skinny Nicole Richie has 
gotten. Where's the logic In that? 

Why do we care so much about 
pseudo-strangers? I say "pseudo- 
strangers" because we sort of know 
them; at least wc think we do. 

That's what we tell ourselves while 
we plaster our walls with pictures and 
stories of them. That's how we jus- 
tify spending $25 on a magazine that 
should've cost four. 

But we just had to get it from eBay. 
(Wait, I'm the only one that does that? 
Crap. Shh, don't tell anyone.) The 
point is that it's an obsession— and a 
ridiculous one at that. 

The only rationale I can find is that 
the gossip mags are a form of escapism. 
For the 30 minutes (or however long it 
takes) to peruse Star or People or US, 
we don't need to think about our lives. 

Instead, we can focus on how 
poorly-dressed Lindsay Lohan was last 
week. (Seriously, Linds, leggings and 
an oversized, off-the-shoulder tee are 



toft 






[ may envelop it— and 



focus on someone else's. But, ulti- 
mately, docs that help us or hurt them? 

I understand that when one siLins up 
to be a celeb as their profession, they 
need to expect to be watched like a 
hawk. It is possible, however, to stay 
out of magazines. 

Kelly Clarkson does it. So does 
Taye Diggs. Even huge names like 
George Clooney can do it. (Yes, it 
makes me even sadder that I know 
who's not in the magazines on a daily 
or weekly basis.) 

All I'm saying is that it's not im- 
possible to handle your business deli- 
cately. Naturally, though, something 
(false or otherwise) will happen and 
their face will be splashed on the 
of everything from OK! to National 

And society just perpetu.iie. im- 
probability of that happening because 
we keep shelling out the cash to read 
about Paris Hilton's latest antics. 

I am, in no way, tsk-tsking 
of us who live our lives focused on the 
lives of celebrities. 

After all, when you point your fin- 
ger at someone, there are three 
pointing back at you. And, quite hon- 
estly, I'm almost certainly the biggest 
culprit ... at least in the Midwest. 




Stem Cell Research 
Could Benefit Society 



Stem cell research has the potential 
to be one of the biggest breakthroughs 
in the medical field. Developments in 
this field can possibly produce cures for 
infamous illnesses such as Alzheimer's 
and Parkinson's disease. So why is 
stem cell research such a big deal? 

Frankly, because of government 
funding and ethics. Stem cell research 
can't move forward with funding from 
the government. However, much like 
abortion, the issue of ethics also comes 
into play: should life and death be put 
into the hands of people? 

These cells are known as pluripo- 
tent stem cells. They are specialized 
cells which are formed during the very 
beginning stages of human embryo 
development and are part of what is 
known as a blastocyst .These cells are 
unique because at this stage in devel- 
opment, they are not specialized and 
have the capacity to develop into 130 
different human tissue types. 

Although stem cell research is only 
in the early stages, there is a growing 



among 
many very effective medical 

n be realized through the cloning of 



I don't think that society can run 

away from issues facing stem cell 
research. If people want to figure out 
how to clone in order to destroy the 
world, then it's going to happen. I think 
that we should regulate the research 
and keep ethics as an important way 
of judging how far to go with stem cell 
research. 

I don't care who you are, but we 
don't need that many more people on 
this planet. There are too many, and we 
can't be selfish in avoiding the inevi- 
table. 

If stem cells are all that they are 
cracked up to be, then we're probably 
going to see both positive and negative 
effects. Like anything, money is what 
makes some things go round. And a lot 
of money can sometimes allow one to 
get you anything that they want. We 

only hope that people

Political Commercials Annoy Viewers 



By Kemlra Leonard 



I can smell it in the air, can't you? 
Mixed in with the familiar autumn aro- 
ma of deceased leaves is the scent of 
politicians prowling televisions, tele- 
phones, and airwaves in hopes of your 
vote. I think I have goose bumps in my 
nostrils. 

It all started when! saw the first Tom 
Hayhurst ad campaign on TV about a 
month ago. I am pretty sure I didn't lis- 
ten to any of it, since I was impatiently 
waiting for "Oprah" to reappear on my 
screen. Yet, I remember thinking it was 
slightly odd for a politically-endorsed 
commercial to be on my television. 

And then, about two commercials 
later, Dick Lugar magically appeared, 
cautioning me to vote for him or else 
Indiana will never develop ethanol gas- 
oline and save our nation and all eter- 

Is it just me, or did we hardly ever 
have politicians shoving mantras and 
policies down our esophagus on TV? 

Maybe we always did, and I didn't 
realize it because we only have the 
"farmer five" al my abode. Or maybe I 
used to live under a rock. Nevertheless, 
I have reached the point where I now 
anticipate Jeep Cherokee commercials. 



Especially since Mark Souder's 
Republicans and Tom Hayhursi have 
Ihi'uii insulting each other with politi- 
cally infused "Yo-Mamma" joke ram- 
pages. Can we please act like grown- 

That's right, Democrats, I never said 
Mark Souder was responsible for those 
ads against Hayhurst. Souder didn't 
pay for them; instead, the Republican 
Party shelled out the cash. The funny 
thing is that they claim lo both be sup- 
porting many of the same issues. 

And would someone please tell me 
why Dick Lugar is on TV? He seems 
like a nice enough guy, but frankly, his 

The main point here is that I have 
no idea who Lugar is up against. I'm 
sure all you political science majors 
out there think I'm a moron, but I am 
speaking for the general public here: I 
honestly think I would have to do ex- 



&gt; find c 



tfhd i 



competition is. Which brings me to my 
next complaint: Why is he or his party 
spending money on campaigns? 

I am sure he or they could be do- 
ing something much better than ensur- 
ing his predicted new term. He could 
give some dough as donations to chari- 
ties, or he could even help move along 



.'Ik: i.l llmseethaii.il [&gt;l:mls lie's always 
talking about, 

Dick, we really do think you're a 
great guy, and when wc want someone 
else in office, we'll give him or her 
money: then you can be worried. 

One thing I will concede: wc seem 
to have three good candidates running 
for Allen County sheriff. 

My personal opinion: Ken Fries is 
the best looking. And 1 can gel away 
with that even though he's Inc same 
age as my mom, because it's the truth. 
And you know it, too, you Democrats 
and Independents. 

The bottom line is that 1 feel like 
I need to find myself again. Sometime 
before Nov. 7, I will need to decide If 
I really am still a Republican. I am so 
dazed and confused after viewing com- 
mercial after commercial (which was 
probably the politician's motives from 
the get-go). 

Dear fellow 1PFW students, most 
of you will have already voted before 
you will have read this article, so i have 
the disadvantage there. But I am certain 
all of us will rejoice as the commercial 
breaks now seem shorter during the 
"Oprah" show, and once again we can 
dream about a muddy, pimped -out Jeep

democracy is the best procedure? 



The- problem is that we've been 
in Iraq for too long now. If we leave 
anytime soon, we'll be facing the same 
results as Vietnam. The only difference 
between now and then is that people 
arc surviving. Don't gel me wrong: 
this war is probably more dangerous. 

Daily roadside bombs and ambush 
attacks are killing many people, while 
leaving others severely injured. Our 
response time on the battle field for 
saving combatants has dramatically 
improved, therefore saving lives. And 
this has everything to do with lives. 

If we were in Iraq and people were 
not gelling killed, then pulling out of 
the country wouldn't be a problem. 

So. it's now Ihe government's re- 
sponsibility lo justify these peoples' 
duty. If we leave now. then their 
mission would have been a waste. 
These soldiers' lives would have been

My idea of democracy is different. Our

SIDS Responsible 
for Infant Deaths 

Creating a safe environment is essential in its prevention 



By Jessie Ruckman 



Imagine yourself, your girlfriend 
or your wife carrying a healthy baby 
lo term and after the nausea, sleepless 
nights and wonderful, giddy excite- 
ment of bringing a new life into the 



world, you take thai perfect, innocent 


infant home to start a new 


family and a 


new life. 




Your new and wonder 


filled life has 


begun and the next morning, week and 


month pass by in a relatively peace- 


ful manner. That is, unti 


one morning 


when, to your horror, y 


ou find your 


happy, well-developed, 


and to-this- 


point healthy baby dead 


in his or her 



This year, many area families have 
experienced this devastating, but some- 
tunes preventable, anomaly. The prob- 
lem, however, is an astounding lack of 
awareness among parents and poten- 
tial parents concerning the effects that 
smoking can have on their child. 

Until recently, the foremost mes- 
sage to parents regarding SIDS (Sud- 
den Infant Death Syndrome) has been 
simply lo place their infants on their 
backs to sleep; however, there is so 
much more to preventing SIDS than 

The most vital way to keep an infant 
safe is to create an overall safe sleeping

you walked into a house covered in gar- 
bage, littered in dirty laundry and pizza 
boxes? Into what type of environment 
has this new child been bora?) 

Infants should not only sleep on 
their backs, but they should also nol be 
wrapped in heavy blankets, fluffy and 
fresh from the baby shower. 

However, the main thing that 
should never-and I repeat-NEVER 
have to be said, but somehow seems to 
need to be shouted into the faces of (he 
ignorant: do not smoke. Do not smoke 
when pregnant. Anyone who can read 
has read or heard this statement at least 
once in their lives, but somehow the 
message doesn't seem to stick with ev- 
il should be obvious that once (he 
bun is out of the oven, the same rule 
applies. 

Infants whose parents smoke are 
not only more likely to die of SIDS, but 
are also much more likely (o develop 
respiratory problems such as asthma. 

Is that cigarette really that important 
that you can't get up off the couch and 
go outside to light up? Is that Camel 
really worth the risk of your infant sud- 
denly dying? 

If smoking in front of a helpless in- 
fant who lacks the ability to say "no" is 
really that important, then a reevalua- 
tion of parenting skills is nol only des- 
perately needed, but necessary as well. 



Online Communication Dissolves Intimate Conversations

In the past few years, new waves

ever. I seem old fashioned because 1 
am still a lillle behind. 

I remember when instant messen- 
ger first came out, and 1 couldn't get 
enough. Now every time someone 
writes "LOL" I wani to scream, which 
is why I don'l communicate with some 
people as much anymore.

I don'l expect long letters in the

real relationships .tnd friendships can 
be built while typing on the comput-

I know this makes me sound very 
old fashioned. Iml 1 have lo agree with 
the older generations when they say

A facc-to-face conversation — re-

really know someone if the only way 
you talk to them is through the use of 
a keyboard? Think of how much the 
tone of a person's voice changes the

Aside from not wanting creeps to

As old-fashioned as it may seem, 
sending a letter instead of an e-mail 
is much more sensitive and thought-

most people make themselves look 
better in their profiles. 
Real friends see you all the time. They 
see your bad looks and they hear the

They just couldn't stand it, could

He has since apologized, claim-

joke aimed at the President. The joke 
was supposed to be "if you don't 
work hard in school, you get us stuck 
in Iraq"; thus, making fun of Bush's 
spotty academic reputation.

Tamaki Performs 

Beautiful Melody 

at Embassy 



By Louisa Danielson 

If a cello can play to the human soul, then Dvorak wrote 
the melody. 

It was during his lerm as director of the American Con- 
servatory of Music in New York (beginning in 1 S92 ) that 
this Czech composer was inspired to write hi-* cello con- 



Intrigued by American Indian melodies (heard al Buffalo 
Bill's Wild West Show in New York) and African Ameri- 
can spirituals (which he learned from one of his students), 
Dvorak blended elements of these and Czech themes into 
his cello concerto in B minor. The result is singular!) minim 
-and it is beautiful. 

Fort Wayne Philharmonic principal cellist ffikaru 
Tamaki, performed this concerto Saturday night, Nov. 4 at 
the Embassy Theatre. Tamaki performed from a small plat- 
form on the stage instead ot directly on the Moor where the 
cellos usually perform. 

Richard Naylor, operations manager with the Philhar- 
monic explained, "[It was[ so he can be above the orchestra 
-a sight line thing." 

The first movement of the concerto had a lengthy intro- 
duction that gave a brief overview of the themes that would 
be covered in the concerto. Tamaki's musical style was pol- 
ished, making the concerto seem easy. 

Following a smooth, hymn-like opening to the second 
movement, Tamaki and the orchestra attacked qniek swells 
in the dynamics, drawing the listeners into the intense, 
martial rhythm of the third movement hrsi chair violinist 
Hiromi Ito accompanied Tamaki on several solo passages. 
The concerto closed with powerful chords blasted trom the 
entire orchestra, capped by a brass fanfare. 

The audience immediately began applauding and stand- 
ing in ovation of the performance. Tamaki received two 
bows and a bouquet of red roses, which he raised in a salute 
of victory to the audience. 

"I would say from audience reaction that it was superla- 
tive," said Jo Ella Evans, usher with the Embassy Center. 

"[The concerto] was recorded." said Jell Moore, grants 




and research manager with the Philharmonic. 
"(It will be] rebroadcasi on WBNI." 

"I thought it was great He played it wonderfully!

The second half of the concert was devoted to Smetana

This work, actually six separate

Stone Sour unleashed their sound into the

This may come as a disappointment to some,

To compensate for the lower level of heavi-

The Guide to Mastodon Basketball 



Seniors Pave the Way 
for Men's Hoops 



Senior leadership is the deep- 
Ihreaded theme of this year's men's 
basketball team. % 

These seniors, who have been 
through the trials of joining NCAA 
Division 1 , are looking to make some 
noise this season. 

An NCAA tournament bid isn't 
likely to be in these young men's 
college future, but they are expected 
to lead an improved, hungry team in 
2006. 

When asked about his team, second- 
year coach Dane Fife talked about what

paratso. 

This season, they bring in Indiana 
State, Valparaiso and Kent State. 

Leading the way for the Mastodons 
are three seniors who know how it feels 
to play against top-notch opponents.

make up our basketball team have

months and 1 would like nothing more 
than for them to have an opportunity to 
reach their goals for the season." 

The team is coming off of a 10-18 
season that saw the 'Dons play tough 
opponents very well, in addition to 
rattling off three straight wins to finish 
the 2006 campaign. 

In addition to defeating Indiana 
State, last year's squad lost lo Notre 
Dame by only 2 and traditional Big Ten 
powerhouse Michigan State by 11. 

With those performances against 
high level teams, the 'Dons are gearing 
to do better this season, but not neces- 
sarily in the win-loss column.

Coach Fife said. "However, whether 
we win or lose. I want to know that we 
played with our hearts. If this happens. 
my personal goal will have been 



istered at 6-9 (Best, Armend Ademi, 
Zeljko Egeric) and one at 6-8 (Jaraun 
Burrows). 

Being able to use that many people 
with decent size will help to wear some 
big guys down, while giving the 'Dons 
the chance to score with the smaller, 
faster guys. 

"The three senior captains are our 
leaders. We are very proud of these 
men and are certainly glad to have 
them in our program, as we are all of 
our players." 

Wins aren't the most important thing 
when it comes to IPFW this season. 

What's important is getting the tcuti

from wanting to win, but if they play

Michigan, Air Force and Valparaiso

the schedule. 

According to Coach Fife, "If sched-

because everyone wants to play us, but 
our challenge is getting home games."
