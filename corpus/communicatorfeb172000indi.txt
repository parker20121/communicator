Diversity Council announces plans for Diversity Week 



Traits that usually divide 
people are being highlighted 
and featured in a celebration 
uniting the campus during 
Diversity Week, Feb. 19-26. 

"Communication is a com- 
mon thread throughout the 
whole week," Jeanette Clausen, 
Diversity Council chair, said. 

Race, gender, class, ethnic 
differences, sexual orientation 



and disabilities are often all 
misunderstood. Focusing on 
communication, the goals of 
Diversity Week include famil- 
iarizing students with other 
cultures and helping students 
understand the differences of 

"The purpose of Diversity 
Week Is to have a whole week 
of celebration and learning 
about different aspects of 
diversity that affect the cam- 
pus, the community and really 
the world," Clausen said. 



The International Unity 
and Friendship Banquet on 
Saturday, Feb. 19, at 6 p.m. 
begins the celebration for 
Diversity Week. An ethnic 
menu sponsored by the 
International Students 
Organization (ISO) is planned.

Minnesota justice visits campus 



by Mishanna Wood, 
Managing Editor 



Minnesota Supreme Court 
Justice Alan Page spoke last 
Thursday as a part of the 
Omnibus Lecture Series about his 
views on today's society and how 
to help children with their edu- 
cation. Page has been elected to 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame and 
Pla\ed lor the Minnesota Vikings 
in the 1970s. During his football 
career, Page went to law school at 
the University of Minnesota. In 
1981, he worked for a Minnesota 
law firm and was later appointed 
special assistant attorney general 
in Minnesota. Page became the 
assistant attorney general and 
associate Justice on the 
Minnesota Supreme Court in '93. 

In his lecture, Page pointed 
out that there is racial bias in the 
court Judicial system. People of 
color are arrested more often, 



have fewer fair trials and face 
harsher punishments. Most of 
this is due to naivete or from old 
laws meant for the good of socie- 
ty. The average arrests for judi- 
cial systems in 1997 showed that 
there were (our times as many 
blacks arrested Tor possession of 
drugs than whites; however, in 
Minnesota, the figures show 
eight times as many blacks 
arrested as whites. Seventy per- 
cent of drug use involves whites, 
yet 70 percent of people arrested 
for drugs are blacks. 

"In order to eliminate racial 
bias, individuals need to change. 
We need to focus on what is 
inside," said Page. There are 
three main lessons (hat will lead 
to change: preparation, overcom- 
ing fears and developing 
character. 

Educating youth is another 
important step towards this 
change. Kids need to be motivat- 
ed to pursue their educational 



goals. Page urged parents to get 
involved with their children' 
education. Pago, a parent him 
self, has donated a great deal of 
his time and money into educat- 
ing America's youth. 

The Page Foundation, estab- 
lished in 1988, helps students go 
to college. Each Page Scholar has 
to pass on the help that he 
received. The scholars have com- 
pleted 75,000 hours of communi- 
ty service by tutoring students 
from their home towns. 



Giving back to the 
ty and receiving an education 
only two parts of the change. 
Character is the final aspect that 
Page mentioned in his lecture. 
This is knowing right from wrong 
and it can be learned from par- 
ents and mentors. 

"We arc all forced to re-eval- 

said Page. 



Performer Frederick Winters hypnotizes IPFW crowd 



by Todd Hamm, 
Staff Writer 



Eighteen audience volun- 
teers fell Into an abysmal trance 
last Thursday afternoon at hyp- 
notist Frederick Winters' presen- 
tation or his skill. The audience 
members, who sat before 50 or so 
students and faculty members in 
Walb Ballroom, slowly relaxed as 
Winters coaxed them under his 
persuasion. He told them to focus 
on a pulsating naked orange light 
bulb. Their eya softened and 
closed, with heads lolling to the 
sides and either resting on their 
neighbors' shoulders or down 
toward their torsos. 

Beforehand, Winters assured 
the volunteers that "getting hyp- 
notized Is very, very safe. It's 
harmless. You will not black out. 
You will not go Into a nighttime 
sleep. You won't turn into a zom- 
bie. You'll know what you're 
doing, but you just won't give a 

Winters, a certified hypno- 
tist with 21 years experience In 
the area, travels around the 
country' giving more than 200 
similar presentations a year. The 
Psychology Club and SAB spon- 
sored event marks the second 
time In the past two years 
Winters has performed at IPFW. 

During the show, Winters 
explained briefly how hypnosis 
works. "All I'm gonna do is sub- 
due the conscious mind. The 



subct 



ilnd c 



"I cannot control anyone," 
he said, "but I do have the power 
of suggesdon, I cannot make you 
do anything dangerous or harm- 
ful. I never embarrass people, 

I will put you In very tunny 

itlons:" The amusing situa- 
tions, once Winters had the vol- 
unteers hvpnotized, took up 
most of the show. 

He told them to belies e they 
were at the movies and then 
behave according to each film 
genre: laughing at a comedy, 
appearing frightened al a horror 
film, ashamed and giggling at a 
pornographic movies. He had 
them believe they were racing 
horses, so they acted as if they 
were riding horses. Earlier, he 
told them that their arms were 
made of steel and they could not 
bend them. 

In a bit of a finale to the 
show, Winters told them to forget 
their names and to react absurd- 
ly to certain sounds and spoken 
numbers. At the first number, 
the female volunteers would feel 
an obnoxious poke in the back. 
At a specific sound, the men 
would believe their zippers were 
undone. At another number, one 
volunteer would believe his shirt 
was Inside out and would have to 
rearrange It. 

At another number, a volun- 
teer would find a roll of toilet 
paper beneath her chair. To her, 
the roll was the most beautlM 
she had ever seen, so beautiful 
she wanted to share It with 
everyone. Then Winters began a 
long monologue in which he 
would alternate between saying 



numbers, asking people their 
names— to which they could not 
respond and having the sound 
man cue sounds that each caused 
the various participants to react 
in their assigned ways. 

Later, Winters told another 
participant that he had no con- 
cept of the number four. It was 
unknown and lost to him. 
Winters then had him count on 
his fingers. Each time he would 
skip four and end up with 11. 
However, as soon as Winters told 
everyone to remember their 
names and anything else lost, 
they did. 

During the show, Winters 
involved them in other scenarios. 
He told them everyone in the 
audience was naked, which made 
them laugh and giggle. Then he 
told them they were the ones 
who were naked, which sent each 
scampering for something or 
some way to cover up. 

He had them Imagine they 
were in fast can and speeding far 
over the speed limit. Then he 
told them a trooper was behind 
them and was going to pull them 
over. "It was kind of scary," Erin 
Emmert, a SAB member and par- 
ticipant said of being pulled 
over. As to the rest of the experi- 
ence, she said, "I Imagined every- 
thing he said. It was intense." 

Germalne Lee, SAB member 
and participant, described her 
experience of being hypnotized. 
"It was total relaxation through- 
out the whole ordeal. 1 saw every- 
thing that he was talking about. 
It was real."

Coliseum 
taxation 



by Nick Melel. Staff Writer 

In Alien County, as well as 
across the nation, far too many 
people find themselves disen- 
chanted with our political sys- 
tem. This is something that 
should concern uj all and Is 
something that we must soon 
change. Before we can offer our 
solution to the problem at hand, 
we must ilrst ask ourselves why 
this situation exists. 

Through my Interactions 
with young, potential voters In 
Allen County, I have found that 
many of these people no longer 
believe that ours Is a government 
of the people, for the people and 
by the people. Too often, our leg- 
islators arc seen acting as If we 
the people live under the rule of 
a government that Is of the 
money, for the money and by the 
money. We need not look very 
far at all to witness a prime 
example of our elected officials 
acting In this manner. 

As a candidate for Allen 
County Council At-Large, It Is 
important that 1 offer my solu- 
tion to one of the most pressing 
questions facing the people of 
Allen County today: Are we to 
expand the arena section of the 
War Memorial Coliseum and If 
so, how shall we fund this 
project? 

Unfortunately, many of our 
legislators and elected officials 
have taken it upon themselves to 
answer the first part of this ques- 
tion for us. With the passing of 
the supplemental food and bev- 
erage tax by the State Senate, 
they have informed us that we 
are Indeed going to move for- 
ward with these massive plans of 
expansion. 

That brings us to the second 
part of the question: How are we 
to fund this expansion? In 1994, 
county officials were reprimand- 
ed for abusing the one percent 
food and beverage tax that was 
to be used for the sole purpose of 
paying off the mammoth debt 
accumulated from the addition 
of the Exposition Center to the 
Coliseum. 

Today, our legislators are 
proposing a tax Identical to the 
one misused in previous yean. 
This tax would be called the one 
percent supplemental food and 
beverage tax. 

The only difference between 
the two taxes would be the addi- 
tion of the word supplemental 
and the removal of a provision 
restricting our elected officials 
from using the revenue for rea- 
sons other than what It had orig' 
Inally been intended. In essence, 
we are being asked to trust the 
same people with the same failed 
tax plan. This Is something that I 
could not do In good conscience. 

At this time, approximately 
S28 million will be needed to 
fund the current plans of expan- 
sion. The one percent supple- 
mental food and beverage tax 
will likely bring In S4 million per 
year. That means the new tax 
burden must remain Intact for at 
least seven years. 

As a citizen of Allen County, 
I find this to be unacceptable. As 
a councilman, 1 will categorically 
oppose any new taxation on the 
people of Allen County to raise 
money that can be earned 
through alternative methods, 
such as deep, responsible spend- 
ing cuts, budget reform and user 
fees. There Is no need to dig up 
fault)' tax plans from the past. 
Other options do exist. 

In 1980, political activist 
and author Joseph Cobb wrote. 
"taxation is exaction, exaction is 
extortion and extortion Is 
unjust." As a conservative, I 
believe these words are true. If 
we are to expand the Coliseum, 1 
believe that more attention 
should be paid to plans that 
replace any form of taxation with 
user fees. 

Through the application of 
appropriate user fees, the expan- 
sion of the Coliseum could be 
paid off In a shorter period of 
time and most importantly, with- 
out laying a hand on one single 
taxpayer dollar. 



Aged vending machine food, library disturbance 



Just last week, a fellow student called our office In 
somewhat of a frenzy. He was speaking so fast, his words 
seemed to run together and the only information the staff 
members he was speaking to could make out was some- 
thing about vending machines and noise in the library. 
The student came to the office and told us his story. 
Indeed, he had two complaints, one concerning the vend- 
ing machines and one 

library, first of all, he 
claimed that, on 
many occasions, the 
food that comet out 
or the vending 
machines is outdated.

outdated food Is 
appalling. 



tells 



that 




there Is a possibility 
we could get food poi- 
soning. We have had 
problems of a differ- 
ent nature with the 
vending machines. 
Sometimes money Is 
miscounted by the 
machine and other 
times change Is not 
returned. For certain 
vendors, nothing can 
be done but to call 
the 1-800 number on 
the machine. We tried 
this and got an 
answering machine 



how the student body 
Is supposed to solve 
this problem. We feel 
the situation with 
outdated food Is a 
disaster waiting to 
happen. This is like a situation in a horror movie where, 
at any moment, the bad guy is going to attack the 
unknowing bystander while the audience waits In antici- 
pation. Is that what we, the IPFW community, arc a part 
of, a horror movief We certainly hope not. There has to be 
someone out there who has the power and know-how to 
take care of the old food In the vending machines. The 
error should be solved Immediately for the sake of our 
well-being and health. The customer always deserves a 



good product. It is obvious that dialing the 1- 
is not an efficient solution. 

The second problem that the student was disgruntled 
with was the noise level in tile library. Before the Science 
Information Center was built, the fourth floor used to be 
the extremely quiet floor. Today the third (loor has taken 
Its place. It is now the official -shhhhhh!" floor. To have a 
very quiet place to 
study on campus Is 
something that should 
be expected of every 
university. However, 
according to our stu- 
dent source, the third 
floor of Helmke 
Library Is not always 
as quiet as It should 
be. Campus Ministry is 
located on the third 
floor of the library. 
Organizations usually 
come together and 
make some amount of 
-noise." We have 
nothing against 
Campus Ministry, but 
being located on the 
designated "quiet" 
floor Is a hindrance to 
the majority of the stu- 
dents as well as to the 
members of Campus 
Ministry. 

Perhaps there Is an 
office for them else- 
where on campus. As 
soon as that space 
becomes available, we 
suggest the adminis- 
tration consider more 
accomodating arrange- 

Campus Ministry Is 
not the .only source of 
extra sound on the 

third floor. It also 
comes from fellow stu- 
dents. Out of respect and consideration for others, we ask 
the student body to keep it down on the third floor. We 
also would like to call for more enforcement of the "silent 
rule" from the people who work in the library- 
One last note on a different subject, we appreciate 
students coming In and telling us about problems they 
have experienced on campus. We feel that when you 
come to us, you help "spread the word" to your fel- 
low student. 



Hope is found in many places 



by Nathan Ericson, Staff Wriler 

Alan Page was in town this 
past Thursday evening and pre- 
sented a lecture entitled "The 
Importance of Mentoring Youth." I 
was unable to attend this lecture, 
but I was able to attend a session 
in the afternoon. This was for 
those who wanted to ask ques- 
tions and see Page close up. Page, 
a Minnesota Supreme Court 
Justice, addressed many things in 
his speech and there were many 
questions that were posed to him. 

One thing that I found amaz- 
ing about Page was that he attend- 
ed law school at the same time 
that he played professional foot- 
ball. He stated that he knew foot- 
ball was not going to carry him 
through the rest of his life. He saw 
the other athletes around him 
who could not read the playbooks 
and decided he had to have some- 
thing to fall back on. He alio had 
parents who pushed him and 
made him set goals. Page said, "If 
you prepare for the future, you 
can do almost everything." He 
also said, "If you're smart enough 
to understand football, you're 
smart enough to perform In the 
classroom." 

I am not a football fan, but 1 
know that the blocking schemes 
and plays that arc run on a foot- 
ball field are pretty complex. I 
know that If a person can under- 
stand them, he surely can under- 
stand algebra and English. 

Page Is a firm believer in peo- 
ple and he believes In helping 
others out. "We can be a part of 
changing the futurel" said Page. 

If Just one of us would be a 
mentor for one other person, 
think about what an effect that 
would have on society. If half of 
us took the Initiative to be 
Involved with others and to help 
them to achieve the hopes and 
dreams for their future, the 
United States would be an even 
greater country than it Is now. 

Just think if this happened on 
a global scale, and what effect it 
could have on world poverty and 



neglect. Think about all the peo- 
ple who may be saved from en " 
Ing up in Jails and prisons. 

It takes around S30.000 
year to incarcerate a person, but 
it takes only about 25 percent of 
that to educate a person. I know 
that I would like some of thai 
S30.000 to help pay for my col- 
lege expenses! It really makes nc 
sense to house all these people 
when a good deal of them could 
be helped. Most of them hav 
hope; they can't see a better 
future. If they could be educated 
and shown they have potential, 
they could become contributing 
members of society. 

Don't get me wrong here, . 
am in full support of the justice 
system and what It does for m 
derers and the like. What I 
talking about are the criminals 
who commit robberies or similar 
crimes. These are the ones who 
start out with "smaller crimes" 
and then they end up committing 
things such as a murder or rape 
because they see no future. If a 
person Is given hope when young, 
he Is more likely to succeed In life 
and be a contributing member of 
society. 

I think 1 would agree with 
Mr. Page on about everything he 
said last Thursday. We all have 
something to contribute to anoth- 
er person, no matter how small. 
We all can become contributing 
members of society If given hope 
and there Is really no excuse for a 
person to not have any hope. If we 
prepare for the future then we 
can virtually succeed in anything 
that we want to. It may take hard 
work and dedication, but we will 
be rewarded for that hard work. 

I am reminded of a saying 
that I heard In my senior year 
economics class, "There Is no such 
thing as a free lunch." We aren't 
going to be able to go through life 
and have things given to us. It 
may happen every once in awhile, 
but to really be successful, we 
must work diligently. 



Different style: R&amp;B 

by Mishanna Wood, Managing Editor 

What do Kid Rock, Marilyn Mauson, Korn, 
Goo Coo Dolls, Elton John and Kenny Rogers 
have In common besides being musicians? 
Over the past year or so, these names have 
Hashed In front of our faces and have been fed 
to us through different media devices. The 
common theme that all of these artists share Is 
a performance at the Memorial Coliseum. 

Not being rhythm and blues artists Is 
another aspect that these performers have in 
common. These groups were the first to come 
to my mind when [ thought of musical visitors 
to the Coliseum. So far, over the past two and 
a half years that 1 have lived In the area, I have 
never been able to recall hearing about even 
one R&amp;B act playing at the Coliseum. 
Apparently, I do not have the same taste as 
the majority of Fort Wayne. 

According to Randy Brown, general man- 
ager of the Memorial Coliseum, R&amp;B tradition- 
ally does not do well in Fort Wayne and cur- 
rently there are only one or two R&amp;B per- 
formances a year. The only group that even 
comes close to being R&amp;B (I think this Is defi- 
nitely stretching it) would have to be Ninety 
Eight Degrees who visited in 1999. 

There have been some others. Brandy, 
Boyz II Men, Usher, Changing Faces, MC 
Hammer, Whitney Houston, TLC, Pebbles and 
even Mllli Vanllli have come to this city in the 
past Tew years. I think that most of these 
artists are great, however, their visits date 
back pretty far. For example Boyz II Men and 
Brandy were here In '95 and Whitney Houston 
was here in '91. 

Brown said the Coliseum's mission Is to 
offer diversity and that R&amp;B Is an untapped 
market. He added that with radio stations 
such as 107.9 and 1023 developing R&amp;B, the 
market in Fort Wayne might grow. The 
Coliseum Is also working with IPFW, said 
Brown, to bring more events. 

I applaud the effort and I think the peo- 
ple of Fort Wayne should give R&amp;B a chance. 
All the groups did quite well except for one 
that Brown mentioned to me. I don't see a 
problem and I think a number of R&amp;B fans In 
the area Is a lot larger than anyone realizes. 1 
personally have never attended a musical 
event at the Coliseum. 

I hope that in the future, the Coliseum 
offers more musical talent that the R&amp;B fans 
In Allen County can enjoy. R&amp;B music Is a 
superb show of talent and creativity. The 
business deserves more recognition and 
ppreclatlon from area citizens. 



Stripping down the 

myths 

by Lisa Galloway, Staff Writer 

It is doubtful that you have missed 
the barrage of billboards and newspa- 
per ads displaying the right wing con- 
viction: "Snip bars and pornography 
victimize women and children." This 
proclamation Insidiously attacks and 
blames the women, those which It 
Intends to protect However, since the 
movement is sponsored by a religious 
group, it probably only Intends to pro- 
tect those virtuously acetic women who 
morally abhor sex... I wonder why their 
husbands would be at strip bars? 

1 think we need to redirect our 
focus from sloping the snip bars to 
examining why they exist. If we take a 
look back In history, pornography, 
prostitution and stripping are not new, 
nor is Christianity. 

Christianity Is the house that guilt 
built. With all of the guilt and sin that 
surround the Issue of sex and sexuality 
In Christianity, It Is not surprising that 
so many people have sexual hang-ups 

Our society Is based on Christian 
tenets, hence a repressed attitude 
towards sex reigns. Sexuality should 
not be repressed; It Is natural. With this 
taboo attitude toward sex remaining In 
the mainstream, we will never be able 
to stop the strip bars and pornogra- 
phy. It will be like prohibition all over 
again. 

Not to mention. It only "band- 
aids" the problem white it misses the 
real issue: Christianity prorogues our 
sexual evolution. 

Being yourself; 
follow your heart 

by Erika Nordblom, Staff Writer 

1 have recently learned a lesson 
about being true to yourself. I have 
realized that Shakespeare was correct 
when he wrote, "This above all: to thine 
own self be true." 

I learned that being true to what 
you believe Is right and to who you are 
will make you truly happy, while doing 
otherwise will only make you unhappy. 
Let me explain, though, how I came to 
realize this. 

When I was In high school, I chose 
to stay away from drinking, which was 
the main pastime of about three 
fourths of my high school population. 1 
had fun with my friends doing other 
things, and I always believed I should- 
n't drink In high school. However, I was 
always a little curious about It. 

Still, even when I got into college, I 
remained the good girl, so to speak, 
and generally stayed away from the 
partying lifestyle. I drank a little, but 
never to excess. I Just didn't think that 
partying to excess was me. I heard sto- 
ries about people going to parties and 
getting really trashed. They claimed It 
was really fun, but still, I didn't do It 

Well, finally, when I recently 
turned 21, I decided to party to the 
extreme. It thought that maybe I had 
been missing out on something really 
great, so I had better make up for lost 
time. I began going out to the ban and 
to parties about as often as I could and 
Just about every time 1 would get really 
trashed. 

Unfortunately, I began doing stu- 
pid things when I was drunk that 1 
would never In a million years do had I 
not been drinking and here's where I 
learned my lesson, 

I quickly realized how much I dis- 
liked myself after I had been partying 
hard. 1 would wake up the next morn- 
ing and think of the things I had done 
and everything I believed was right. 

I discovered that partying hard 
and getting plastered all the time Just 
wasn't me. I enjoyed other things In life 
a whole lot more. 

This Isn't* an article against party- 
big and drinking. I mean, I have to 
admit, for awhile, I had a lot of fun. It's 
Just to say that through this behavior, 1 
realized I wasn't being me and I learned 
that you have to be true to yourself In 
life and do what feels right to you, 
despite what others may say or do. 

To conclude, I decided to stop 
parrying all the time as soon as I real- 
bed how untrue to myseir I was really 
being and, consequently, I am a lot 
happier again. I got back to things that 
have always made me happy before. 
Now I have gone back to following my 
personal beliefs about lire. Shakespeare 
certainly knew what he was talking

power, its buddies ever got

and declining to dance would 
be IPFW. "I'm lust really tired," 
would be the a 



IPFW would be a dull per- 



son because the campus lacks 
what every exciting person 
has. IPFW lacks personality. 
IPFW has no character. No one 
can fully put the blame on the 
campus itself, though. IPFW. in 
its own right, Is a wonderful 
facility with countless out- 
standing professors. What 
keeps IPFW so Introverted and 
scared are its students who are 
lust unaware or all the culture 
their campus possesses. 

How many students know- 
why the Classroom Medical 
Building is titled as such7 All of 
the courses I've ever taken in 
there have Included some form

upon itself. Hypo (helically, if 
IPFW ever dated, its ex would 
probably blame the campus' 
pathetic existence on its own 
selfishness. 

"All it (IPFW) ever talked 
about was itself," Its ex would 
emphatically explain. "All it 
would ever say is 'I can't wait 
until I get dorms. I wish 1 could 
go Division 1 soon so more peo- 
ple would come to my games.' 
I've found somebody new, 
though. Somebody who isn't so 
self-centered. IVe never been 
happier."

IPFW's personality is the 
enlarged superego It carries.

pus more of a pillar in the 
community don'L When was 
the last time IPFW actually 
went outside of its own realm 
to do some public work? 

Why don't IPFW organiza- 
tions volunteer at shelters? 
Why doesn't IPFW's basketball 
team challenge the Fury' and 
donate the proceeds? IPFW 
wants everything handed to it 
and demands approval with- 
out really deserving It. 

As long as this campus 
maintains Its self-centered per- 
sonality and lack of culture, It 
will never grow. 

Anyone concerned needs 
to realize that we need to stop 
complaining about student 
disinterest and realize it is 
because little is being done to 
interest them.

Patterson, director of

said the event is important 



to her. *ln my perspective, the 
more we know about each

along. Because the economy Is 
fast becoming more global and 
diverse, we need to team how 
to move beyond our culture 
and celebrate others as we col- 
cbrate ourselves.' said 
Patterson. 

Festive events like this can 
change minds and hearts. By 
combining different cultures, 
Patterson said, They can Icam 
that they have more In com- 
mon than they thought they 
did." Diversity Week, which 
lasts from Feb. 19-26. will help 
to connect with those one may- 
have only passed by on cam- 
pus. According to Asur, a sen- 
ior ma|oring In computer sci- 
ence, it took two to three 

iths to plan this event. 

The event presents the 
opportunity for IPFW students 
to learn about other cultures 
that are here on campus. 
"Ignorance is the greatest 
deterrent. Through knowledge 
of each other's culture, we are 
able to move to the next level, 
and celebrate and appreciate 
each other," said Patterson. 

Many people who grew up 



in Fort Wayne might not know 
how diverse the campus really 
is. "This event," according to 
Waters, "will open the eyes to 
all our students, as well as 
staff, to the diversity that real- 
ly exists on campus." 

The International Unity 
and Friendship Banquet will 
also have an array of items 
that represent each of the cul- 
tures. "On display will be pho- 
tographs, pottery and items of 
particular significance to each 
culture," said Asur. 

Waters said there would 
also be a fashion show.

The importance of this 
event cannot be over-empha-

International Student Series: Interview with Albi Minga, Republic of Albania 



Albania Is a mojtly moun- 
tainous region wlih narrow 
coastal lowlands. Weather Is 
usually mild and wet In win- 
ters, and hot and dry In sum- 
mers. Albania, one of lite 
smallest countries In Europe, Is 
where IPFW student Albi Minga 
comes from. She moved to Fort 
Wayne three years ago. "Before 
we came to Indiana, we went to 
Rome, then Chicago, and final- 
ly to Fort Wayne." She 
explained that she came here 
because her aunt and uncle 
had already lived In Fort 
Wayne for eight years. 

■1 got to Fort Wayne In 
July 1996," said Minga. The 
first thing she noticed was how 



a stranger Is treated. "In 
country, if we see some 
that doesn't speak their lan- 
guage, we try to be friendly, 
make them comfortable, make 
them feel warm." When she 
came here, she felt detached. 
She did not feet she could 
openly ask for help. "I still 
don't feel like It Is home," said 
Minga. 

"I haven't been back to 
my country." She explained 
that It would feel odd if she 
did. The first two weeks she 
was in Fort Wayne, she 
thought she was In a fantasy 
land. "It looked so perfect in 
the beginning." The city 
seemed big to her. She also 
noticed the style of clothing 
people wore. "People seemed 
real attached to their looks and 
how they dressed," Minga said. 

"Our food in Albania, 



except for spices, is relatively 
the same as here,* she further 
stated. 

The water apparently 
Isn't, though. "The lint week I 
didn't cat anything, and drink- 
ing the water made me sick," 
Minga said.

time are very Important id

Day, Teacher's Day and labor 
Day. May 1 is my birthday, as 
well as Labor Day," said Minga.

'Assassins' designer wins award for costumes 



An IPFW theatre graduate 
won a regional costume design 
competition at the American 
College Theatre Festival and 
will go on to the nationals. 

One of the (udges of the 
design competition stood on 
the old wooden stage of the 
ornately decorated Pabst Blue 
Ribbon Theater with only a 
microphone stand In front of 
her. As she announced the 
winner of the Barbizon Award 
for Costume Design Tor the 
Midwest Region of the 
American College Theatre 
Festival, the students from 
IPFWs Theatre Department 
held their breath until she 
announced that the winner 
was Sarah Lankonau of IPFW 
for her costume designs for 
"Assassins." A collective breath 
was then exhaled with a 
cacophony of shouts and 

Lankenau's journey to the 



festival In Milwaukee 
long one, starting last 
long before the first rehearsal 
for the musical "Assassins." 
This was Sarah's senior proj- 
ect-a requirement of an)' the- 
atre major and a monumental 
task-to design the costumes 
for an entire production on 
her own. The script brings 
together presidential assassins 
from John Wilkes Booth to 
John Hinkley In a thought-pro- 
voking and sometimes disturb- 
ing exploration of the assas- 
sins' motives and psyches and 
was also director John Hermes' 
senior project. This production 
was especially challenging for 
any designer as It included 
costumes from the 1860s to 
the 1980s. 

When Lankenau reached 
the Festival, she brought with 
her months of research, multi- 
ple drawings of each costume, 
painstaking hours spent con- 
structing the actual 
weeks of rehearsal and 
weekends of perfoi 
where the costumes helped the 



audience recognize the time 
period of the non-linear 
scenes. All of this she con- 
densed Into pages of research, 
renderings of the costumes as 
they were conceptualized and 
pictures of the actors in per- 
formances wearing the cos- 
tumes as they appeared 
squeezed onto a four-by-elght 
foot display stand. 

Lankenau will take her 
display onto the national com- 
petition in May where she will 
compete against eight other 
regional costume design win- 
ners. The competition will take 
place at the Kennedy Center 
and the Idea of this display of 
assassins, including Oswald 
appearing at a building named 
after an assassinated presi- 
dent. Is certainly ironic. After 
graduating In December, 
Lankenau is now working pro- 
fessionally In theatres In our 
area and at IPFW. Her cos- 
tumes will next be seen In this 
semester's "How 1 Learned to 
Drive," also directed by John 
Hermes. 



back," said Minga. 

She went on to explain the 
first Tour months in high 
school here. She described 
how she hand made a tradi- 
tional gift for her teacher. 
"She acted very surprised. The 
very next day she got me 
something and I didn't want to 
keep It, because I didn't think 
she had to get me something," 
said Minga. 

This was the lint 
Christmas Minga was here. In 
her country, the teacher 
receives many gifts, without 
returning the favor in many 
cases. "When 1 refused to take 
her gift, she seemed equally 
puzzled," said Minga. She was 
not used to receiving a gift so 
automatically. In a culture in 
which teachers are looked at 
like parents, It is not unusual 
for discipline, such as spank- 



ing, to take place in schools 
either. In addition to gift giv- 
ing, Minga also said the school 
days are much longer here. 

Time commitments are 
less rigid in Albania. If a stu- 
dent decides he Is bored, he 
can leave. They did not always 
necessarily start class at an 
exact time, cither. 

However, Minga explained 
that there is a definite time the 
students must study. There 
was recreational activity after 
school. "We saw after school 
recreation as an equal oppor- 
tunity," said Minga. "We would 
go to garden parks, dance, do 
gymnastics. Gymnastics was 
the most preferred." 

Minga speaks five lan- 
guages. "I speak Albanian 
(Shqlp), Macedonian, French, 
Italian, and English. My 
favorite is English," said 



Minga. She explained she likes 
English the best because there 
Is so much to team about It. 
"There Is an attitude In the 
words you speak," she said. "In 
my language, people talk very 
quiet, very silent, so nobody 

If I need to say 
can say It, despite 
around. I really se 



t, but here, 

te thing, i 

who Is 



i the 
language." 

It is no wonder Minga Is 
very well known at IPFW, even 
though It Is only her first year 
here. Albanian hospitality Is a 
cultural hallmark. 

Even though the men usu- 
ally head the household arid 
women are responsible for 
cooking, cleaning, and caring 
for the children In Albania, 
Mlnga may not fit the mold. 
She wants to be a lawyer.

Revised International Studies Certificate 
provides many opportunities in travel 



Too many people only 
m about traveling. They 
usually too busy working 
" local jobs. Does this case

on. The next Tact might ele- 
vate your future's horizon. 
Did you know that in a recent 
survey conducted by Jeanette 
Clausen, assistant vice chan- 
cellor of Academic AITalrs, 
local Fort Wayne businesses 
think an international educa- 
tion or background would be 
very beneficial] 

Okay, so maybe you can't 
travel— yet. Did you know 
though that Nancy Virtue and 
Laurie Corbin, professor of 
French and Co-director of 
International Studies, have 



great because it is helpful to 
have students from different 
regions, background and with 
different outlooks,' said 
Corbin. "Out of ten of my 20th 
Century Literature class, three 
speak French." 

Underscoring the signifi- 
cance of knowing a second 
language. Corbin continues, 
"If you are doing business 
with a company in Quebec, 
you have to be able to com- 
municate in French." 

In order to accommodate 
business and students' needs, 
Virtue helped develop the cer- 
tificate so that classes already 
taken by a student may be

Certificate to meet the 
demands of local businesses 
and students? 

Local businesses such as 
Tokhelm Corporation are pay- 
ing their employees to learn a 
second language. "1 have a 
French student right now 
being paid by Tokheim to take 
my French class because they 
send her abroad," said Virtue. 

Keep in mind, most of us 
only "dream" of traveling by 
the time we land that local 
job. How would you like your 
employer to pay you to travel 
instead? 

Corbin also is the director 
of the overseas program. 
"Most students from Angola 
speak French," Corbin said. 
They already have an interna- 
tional background, but what

Certificate. "There ; 
that aren't offered regularly 
that may have been taken by 
the student and may be 
accepted with approval from 
Virtue or me," said Corbin. 
"We have also designed It so 
as to accommodate other 
majors," adds Virtue. 

After pulling down the 
"Academic Quick Links" menu 
on IPFWs web page, selecting 
International Studies, and 
arriving at Its home page, sur- 
vey results can be accessed by 
clicking the "Why 
International Studies?" link.

Germany." 

" You can do the overseas 
program without the Interna- 
tional certificate, and you can 
do the International certifi- 
cate without studying 
abroad," said Corbin. "Among 
the most popular and least 
expensive programs for sum- 
mer are Paris, Franco; 
Salamanca, Spain; Quebec, 
Canada and Guanajuato, 
Mexico," 

Corbin recommends that 
"If you're going to go to the 
effort, staying as long as you 
can Is more beneficial." 

"As far as the Quebec 
program, you come back hav- 
ing really made progress In

In addition to the choice 
of region a student may want
