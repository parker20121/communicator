The student vote 

Campus elections need 
drastic improvements 

Students have been having a hard time finding the 
polls on this campus. Last year, out of close to 12,000 
students, only 557 voted in the Students' Government 
elections. 

Let's put away student apathy and heed the words 
of Kristina Frazier-Henry last year after the poor 
turnout at the campus elections, i Ihink next year 
will be a turning point for Students' Government. 
Snyder and our senate will put Students' Government 
back on the map. Next year it will be like a real 
election." 

To make the elections a success, as Frazier-Henry 
predicted, drastic changes to the election process at 
IPFW are needed. The election system as it has been 
in years past was inadequate because of the lack of 
convenient times to vote, the poor location of the 
polls, and the lack of knowledge about the candi- 
dates. 

L 
In; 

With the onslaught of semester's end papers and 
exams, election days can pass without a second 
thought. 

However, if the polls were open not two but four 
days the distinct possibility would arise of having 
more voters participate in the election. 

But having the polls open for two more days is not 
the only incentive to get voters to vote. The location 
of the polls attracts or detracts attention from the 
elections. 

Last year the polls were located in Kettler Hall. 
Kettler Hall isn't even in the center of campus. If the 
polls were relocated to a location closer to the center 
of campus, more voters would take part in the cam- 
pus elections. 

Some students never set foot in Kettler Hall after 
they buy their books. Their classes are elsewhere. 
Likewise, there are students who never set foot in 
Classroom Medical Building. A favorable election 
system would include two election sites, complete 
with a computer system to assure that students only 
voted once. This system is not within the reach of 
Students' Government, however. 

There still can be a solution, though. Two polls may 
not be a possibility, but one mobile poll will solve the 
problem. Set up the elections in Kettler Hall for two 
days and then move the polls to Classroom Medical 
Building for two additional days. Students can take a 
few minutes out of their schedule to vote on their way 
to or from class in the convenience of the same 
building. 

The final problem facing students is the lack of 
candidate information. It is four weeks until the 
elections will take place: who is running and on what 
platforms? 

If the election board, which was finally established 
this past Tuesday, would have been established fur- 
ther in advance, information on candidates may have 
been already in circulation. 

Hopefully the new election board will take heed to 
ideas like these and incorporate some of their own to 
make this election "like a real election."
