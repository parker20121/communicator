A road grader levels the area around the new parking lot. 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



When one enters the cam- 
pus, and views the eyesore that 
i- commonly called a cons mic- 
tion site, it is fairly easy to be 
annoyed at what seems be a 
never-ending mess, 

There is good and bad news 
concerning the construction at 
IPFW First, there is money to 
complete the projects, in spite of 
rumors to ihe contrary. 

And second the bad news, 
the roads are about as conve- 
nient as they are going to gel. 

The reasons for all of the 
construction are the McKay 
Project, Science Building and an 
additional parking garage. 

The McKay Farm Project 
involves the new Science 
Building The title McKay is 
derived from the original owner 
of the land where the Science 
Building is being constructed. 

The land was given to IPFW 



to help the university fulfil] its 
mission. The land has been 
owned by IPFW for nine years. 

The purpose of the Science 
Building will be lo house three 
science departments currendy 
housed in Kettler Hall. Kettler is 
approximately 30 years old. 

The new structure will allow 
for more modem facilities and 
will accommodate more stu- 
dents. The building will house 
the following science depart- 
ments: biology, chemistry and 
geo-sciences. 

Having die new building 
will also allow for more staff 
offices. Also scheduled for 
inclusion in the building are two 
lecture balls: one tiered hall that 
will provide room for about 120 
students and one small lecture 
hall. 

The parking garage is anoth- 
er cause of headaches at IPFW, 
bul it is to the benefit of every- 
one on campus that it is being 
built. 



The new garage is being 
designed to have 950 spaces. 
This will possibly free up some 
of the parking tots around build- 
ings. 

Because of its sue, the road 
around the new parking garage 
had to be moved, necessitating 
the roundabout and subsequent 
confusion that it caused. 

According lo Vice 
Chancellor of Financial Affairs 
Walt Branson, these projects are 
not plagued by financial woes. 
because ihey are scheduled to be 
completed on time. 

"We hope the inconvenience 
is over at this point," said 



"The traffic circle (construc- 
tion) was interruplcd this sum- 
mer: we tried to gel it as usable 
as possible," he added. 

All in all, the construction is 
just a uny obstacle on the road of 
expansion at IPFW 



Ten Commandments on campus 



Br Lucinoa Fox 
Staff Reporter 

, One well-known religious cir- 
cle is Inter Varsity Christian 
Fellowship. The organization was 
fust established in the United Slates 
in the 1940's in Michigan, but it 
was founded in Cambridge. 
England, in the late 1800's. Located 
on about 800 U.S. university cam- 
puses, all chapters of Inter Varsity 
Christian Fellowship share a com- 
mon goal: 'To continue to build up 
a collegiate fellowship as (he oldest 
outreach known to secular campus- 
es all across America." 



Now you may be wondering. 
"'Wbal does Inter Varsity Christian 
Fellowship have to do with the Ten 
Commandments?" Every fall the 
group gels ready lo present a newly 
planned activity thai ihey believe is 
designed for the whole community. 
This year their focus lies on the Ten 
Commandments The students who 
run the program are prepared to 
share a message thai they hope 
might belter the lives of ail people. 
Il is also very important to noie that 
everyone is invited to join in the 
study whether or noi they share or 
follow the same religious doctrine. 
"We're not interested in telling 
people what to believe; we're more 



inlerested in seeing people 
approach iheir faith journey with 
integrity and authenticity by study- 
ing the scriptures for themselves," 
said Kent Ziessler. of Inter Varsity 
Christian Fellowship. 

"We're here to help them in 
thai process We say lo the seeking 
student, 'Come and see for yourself 
who Jesus is.'" 

For all those interested in this 
learning experience the program 
will be running from Sept. 5 
through Dec 12 Meetings are held 
each Friday night from 7:15 lo 9

Professors honored 



By Dodie Miller

The IPFW Office of Academic 
Affairs honored the following facul- 
ty members at the faculty/staff con- 
vocation Aug. 25. 

Honored for bringing significani 
recognition to the university in ihe 
eyes of ihe general public include

New faculty learning ropes 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Fall is a time of change, and 
IPFW is no exception lo this univer- 
sal rule. 

Additions are being completed 
all over campus, and ihe academic 
departments are no exception. 

The matbemaiical sciences 
depanmeni has added two full-time 
professors. 

These are in addition lo the 
many pan-time instructors, as well 
as visiting professors. 

"We're always ready for new 
professors," said Raymond Pippen, 



head of ihe mathematical sciences 
department 

Keeping with ihe element of 
change at IPFW. it is no surprise that 
the university, particularly ihe maih 
department, has increased its faculty 
numbers. What does this mean for 
students' 7 

"Full-time professors are more 
available to students because of 
increased office hours," said 
Pippcrt. 

"Perhaps then, the math depart- 
ment could increase its efficiency" 

In light of all this, il makes one 
wonder, what does it take for a 
prospective professor to be a desired 
candidate for tenure at IPFW? 



Essentially, Pippen looks for 
people with a good teaching back- 
ground The new math department 
faculty members meei ibis criteria 

The new full-time professors are 
Dan Coroian and Adam Coffman. 

Both Coroian and Coffman are 
technology-oriented. Coroian spe- 
cializes in computing and Coffman 
was in charge of the web site at the 
University of Chicago 

The mathematical sciences 
department is not ihe only IPFW 
academic sector experiencing 
change. 

The communications depart- 
ment recently welcomed Lesa R. 
Vartaman as assistant professor of 



psychology 

She received her Bachelor of 
Arts in Communication from 
Michigan State University. Masters 
of Arts in Psychology from Northern 
Illinois University (De Kalb) and in 
August of 1997. she received her 
Ph.D in Psychology from Northern 
Illinois University. 

So far, Vartanian's experience at 
IPFW has been pleasant. 

"I ihink it's great. I'm really 
impressed wiih the facilities and stu- 
dents-die general atmosphere," said 
Vartanian.

Sorg bids adieu 

The past has caughi up with Jeffrey Sorg. the Allen County Surveyor, 
this past weekend. Sorg's felony convictions from two decades ago have 
recently surfaced and have cost him his job. 

Sorg was convicted in separate cases for second-degree burglary and 
theft in the mid-70's. He blames a drug problem for his actions, which he 
has long since overcome, 

Indiana law states that anyone convicted of a felony cannot run or hold 
an office. Sorg had signed a statement before his election that slated he 
did not have a criminal record. Sorg said that he thought the law applied 
to convictions acquired by elected officials while in office, not prior to 
being elected. 

"He's very upset with the situation and he has given every ounce of 
effort 10 running the surveyor's office," said Steve Shine, Allen County 
Republican Chairman. 



National 

Grad test scam 

Across the country, several hundred students have been accepted lo 
grad schools under false pretenses Apparendy, these students bought 
answers to the entrance exams. Some paid as much as $9,000 to receive 
the higher fraudulent score. 

For three years, a sophisticated group of test-takers used the differ- 
ent time zones to their advantage. According to court records, the con- 
spirators in New York would spend their break-times on cellular phones 
relaying answers to their counterparts in Los Angeles. Students on both 
coasts can take the same admission exams three hours apart. 

Answers would be quickly coded on the side of peneds or on small 
erasers then delivered to clients at test siies around Southern California 
during iheir breaks. An informant's tip brought the scam into the light, 
otherwise no one would have noticed.

Students' addictions 
should be exposed 



We have seen other IPFW stu- 
dents come to class high It is a 
problem which exists and has been 
easily discarded too many limes. 
Students who come to class high or 
drunk do not belong in college. 

Last Spring, the Communicator 
conducted a small survey which 
concerned campus crime and safely. 
One of me questions asked was. 
"Have you ever gone to class high 
before?" Out of 80 responses, eight 
replied that they have gone to class 
high 

We have known of others our 
age who at one time have attended 
IPFW but dropped out because of an 
addiction. We know a former stu- 
dent addict who became a third lime 
reluming fresh- 
man because of 
the inability to 
handle die reality 

of college. Some ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
of these individu- ■ 

als have the talent 
bui prefer to

There is no

only for Ihem- 
selves. We are 
aware that no one 
can prevent them 
from using. 

Students who 
use on campus 
never consider 
(he consequences 
of being arrested. 
A felony convic- 
tion may ruin not 
only a college 
career but also 
most employ- 
ment opport uni- 
ties 

Today, most

Marijuana can 
stay in ihe system 
for several years 
and harder sub- 
stances can stay 

in ihe body for even longer. Don'l 
ruin your potential for a one time

Al IPFW it is illegal to "Sell, 
manufacture, distribute, dispense, 
possess or use an illegal drug or con- 
trolled substance," according to ihe 
Campus 1997 Drug Pobcy Guide 

Those who have remained in 
college and still use dady may be 
hanging by a thread because they 
cannot control their drug habit 

Recently, a stall member was 
approached and asked to go out on a 



date by a student who reeked of a 
controlled substance This incident 
raised several questions. Did be 
drive himself? Did he pass any of 
his classes? Did he realize how 
strong the smell of marijuana was on 
his clothes? 

We have witnessed this behavior 
and have turned the other cheek? We 
know it is not safe to approach these 
individuals without seeming like the 
Drug Police coming to take them 
away. These students who lake risks 
by coming to campus high will 
argue thai the student population 
docs not have a right to report 
instances of abuse. They claim 
reporting their aciivities is an 
infringement of their right (o priva-

Would it

40 classes 1 We believe going lo one 

class high is one class loo many. 

As students here, we should 
demand a safe environment and 
should make a conscious efTort to 
separate ourselves from this by 
acknowledging ihe problem. 

We cannot do anything but ask 
those people using to stop doing it 
on campus. And if (hey cannot, at 
least do not drive and endanger the 
rest of us commuters.

Student disappointed with campus race relations 



To the Editor: 



Thank you for your excellent 
staff editorial. "People in Glass 
Houses Sbould Not Throw Stones." 
Regardless of how one might assess 
the validity (and ethics) of Ihe 
research report you tiled, punning 
out Ihe ironies inherent in Ihis sce- 
nario was a courageous atiempi lo 
address a crucial problem here at 
IPFW. Unfonunaiely. the lack of 
African -American and Latino facul- 
ty representation is only one of our 
problems. Another problem, one thai 
1 believe is even more crucial, is the 
kind of blatant, institutional racism 1 
have seen directed toward a friend I 
find il difficult lo believe that my 
friend is the one student out of 
10,000 who has had this experience, 
or a similar one, at IPFW. 

This issue has ycl to be resolved 
lo my friend's satisfaction. But I 
have seen first-band jusi how effec- 



tive [PFW's an ti- discrimination pol- 
icy is — effective in protecting our 
administration from taking responsi- 
bility for tbeir failure lo protect stu- 
dents from racist faculty Even 
worse than the adminislralion's 
bogus attempt (o address my friend's 
complaints was the way one lime 
supportive faculty members dis- 
tanced themselves from her and the 
way others were swallowed by the 
administration's lokenism. The fac- 
ulty and adminislraiors who were 
involved in ihis case were so con- 
sumed with fortifying their ranks 
they didn't even have the human 
decency lo say thai they were sorry 
for what ihey were willing to admit 
my friend bad endured. Is ibis the 
slralegy part of IPFW's plan for 
retention? It is exactly this kind of 
self-absorbed, evasive cowardice 
lhat feeds racism, thai maintains it as 
a pervasive institutional pathology 

For weeks no one wanted lo be 
involved; now skeletons are coming 
oul of the closet. It was no surprise 



that it wasn't ihe firsl time — only 
awareness and determination can 
make it the last. Our silence will not 
prolect us. I, for one, have not strug- 
gled six years toward a university 
education lo do no more than to sit 
back and wait to take my designated 
place among the sergeants of the 
system If this kind of racist behav- 
ior and a mentality capable of pro- 
ducing it arc the price of entry into 
the middle class, they can keep the 
door locked! 

A few weeks ago, I expressed 
these thoughis lo a faculty member. 
a person I have grown to respect 
whose fnendship I value. 

He said to me, "But you've 
always been treated well here, 
haven't you?" 

"Yes, but that's not the point. 
This isn't about me The experience 
has shown me the lerms of my 
acceptance, the contingencies upon 
which 1 have been allowed to partic- 
ipate," I said. 

Those terms are no longer 



Ic lo me 

I will nol tolerate the institution- 
al racism I have witnessed here at 
IPFW, nor will I allow the injustice 
of inadequate, insincere administra- 
tive responses which exacerbate il 
(racism) to be swept under ihe rug of 
"diversity." 

ThLs is not a "diversity" issue 
lhat we arc dealing with; Ihis is sys- 
tematic, institutionalized racism and 
it's a crime! I learned that here — 
from ihe faculty at IPFW And 
although they've taught me well, il 
is now lime to eradicate this institu- 
tional racism because simply recog- 
nizing it, naming it and surviving it 
will never be cnougb.

Har-ass-ment or ha-rass-ment? 



Do the Math: Nol Beckley 




Maybe you have (like I have) 
noticed a billboard on Clinion 
Slreel telling the world how bad 
"Sexual Harassment" is. The bill- 
board features a 
picture of aboul 

nine women ^^^^^^^™ 
ranging from 
Grandma lo 
"Little Sally 
Schoolgirl" and 
Ihe words accompanying the enor- 
mous photo were "Sexual Harassment 
Can Happen to Anyone." 

I do not doubt that claim, but if 
Ihe words say anyone, shouldn't they 
include anyone. With the photo, you 
would assume thai the words should 
have said "Sexual Harassment Can 
Happen to Anyone Without a Penis" 
because there were no men featured in 
this pic lure. 

I know thai men being sexually 
harassed happens rarely in compari- 
son to women being sexually 
harassed, bui it does happen. 

Can anyone actually define sexual _&gt;_^_^_ 
harassment? I've tned in the past, but 
the definitions I can find in the dictio- 
nary rarely coincide with ihe multitude of sexual harass- 
ment suils fded in ibis country. 

The most humorous was the case where a woman 



BUT WHEN DO WE 

DRAW THE LINE 

BETWEEN 

HARASSMENT AND 

JUST BEGGING 

FOR A DATE? 



said a co-worker's discussion of a Seinfield episode sex- 
ually harassed her in some way The episode in question 
concerned Jerry's forgetting a woman's name, bul 
remembering lhat il sounded like a part of a women's 
anatomy Names bke Regina, Mulva 
etc. were used I think the woman's 
^^^^^^— name was Celeste. 

Back to the offen- 
sive billboard. I understand ihe rea- 
soning behind iL but when do we 
draw the line between harassment 
and just begging for a dale? If a man 
is attracted to a woman in the work- 
place and asks ber out, what is the 
harm in lhat? 

Does it only become 
sexual harassment when ihe man ask- 
ing the woman out is her boss or is 
just bull-ugly? I'll bet you that a lot of 
men being sued for sexual harass- 
ment are butt-ugly men who have no 
chance of getting a date. If ihey were 
attractive to the women would it 
cease to be sexual harassment? 
Possibly 

I baven'l seen Brad 

Sh^h5 Pitt as ihe subject of a harassment suit 

or Mel Gibson being fingerprinted for 

sexual harassment. When was the last 

lime you saw one of the Baldwin brothers arrested for 

creating a hostile workplace. 

Think aboul il . . Do the math.

I don't know wbat this lack 
of having a focus is caused by. If I 
knew, I would have saved myself the 
Itiree years of not having one I can 
easily sympathize with other's lack of 
desire to be in school or working 40 
plus hours a week, but 1 would not 
trade them for anything. At least I'm 
doing something. Otherwise things jusl 
wouldn't be quite right. 

Why did I write this col- 
umn? I don't know. I guess I just got a 
little sentimental about the past and 
started thinking about how much 1 
wish I would have known what I know 

now about school and how life is 

Amazingly enough, they're boih even 
more unpredictable than I thought. I 
know that I can't exacdy help others to 
sec what I didn'i see when I first started college and 1 
guess that is what is most frustrating. If anything, I just 
want others to know that I have been where they are in 
this aspect 

Yep, that's what I'm talking about.

I believe individuals 
choose noi to aiiend college are no 
worse than those who do. If a person 
has the opportunity to earn S9 or SI 2 
an hour without a college degree, 
why not pursue il? Completing col- 
lege is a pain. On average, il lakes 
a college student sin years to Finish 
an undergraduate degree. 

Some of our peers who have 
tried the college experience argue 
that it was noi for them. Why? We 
all know why. The sterile environ- 
ment, the expense of a full course 
load, the books, the time it takes io 
concentrate for an exam. For what- 



ever the reason. 1 appreciate Ihe 
boldness of those individuals who, 
knowing the risks, prefer to be indi- 
viduals 

1 believe thai no one. not even 
parents have Ihe right lo dictate lo 
young women, such as myself, lhat 
Ihey are only good enough for olher 
college students. How limiting il is 
When 1 speak of someone 1 
would like to date, my parents 
always ask. "And whal is his 
major?" They assume this like any 
other parents would. 

Whom you choose to be with is 
your own decision. I believe no one 



has ihc right to dictate that 1 should 
go oui with only college educated 
men. 

There is much to be learned b&gt; 
dating blue collar workers, (or 
example, because the) arc n ol 
more down to earth So what if he 
does noi have a college degree? He 
is not less of ;i person 

Besides, whai a Fireman or 
policeman does everyday is much 
more interesting than to regurgitate 
each other's lesson's of the day 

He could say, "I sand some one 
from their car today and they are all 
right now." How very romantic!

The Latest Addition to the IPFW Campus 



By Adam Munoy 
Staff Reporter 



Tbc Human Services 
Organization is the newest organiza- 
tion to offer its services to (he stu- 
dents of IPFW The Human Services 
Organization is geared toward show- 
ing students in the field of Human 
Services the importance of network- 
ing with the local community and 
other Human Services workers All 
students in the that field as well as all 
other majors are welcome to join 

In forming a Human Services 



Organization on campus it is hoped 
that students can be provided with a 
chance to become a part of the net- 
woriung process between the IPFW 
campus and the Fon Wayne commu- 
nity. This should allow students to 
see the numerous avenues that their 
field of study has to offer them after 
graduation, according to Ken 
Gumbert, chairman of the organiza- 
tion. 

Membership is open to any 
IPFW student as long as the individ- 
ual is enrolled in at least one credit 
hour course and has a cumulative or 
semester GPA of 2.00. There is an 



application for membership and a S5 
fee which gives each applicant mem- 
bership for one year after the appli- 
cation has been approved by the 
executive branch of the organization. 

The executive board of the 
Human Services Organization is 
composed of Gumbert, Vice- 
Chairman Mindi Dunlap and 
Financial Officer Elaine Scott. Their 
adviser is Carol Leiserson, Assistant 
Professor of the Human Services 
Depanment. 

The Human Services 
Organization wants to give students 
more in-deptb information about ccr- 






ufi canon in jobs in the Human 
Services field. The group would like 
to get involved with a non-profit 
organization in the community as 
well as with the anti-drug and alco- 
hol awareness events on campus 
The group tries to find the best way 
to serve the community, the student 
population and the campus, Gumbert 
said. 

The intent of this organization is 
not to "down-grade" the importance 
of other professionals in the commu- 
nity or other programs on campus 
The group would like to increase the 
awareness of bow important the 
Human Services worker is to a com- 



Making beautiful music together 



goal of Fort Wayne Philharmonic 



By Gail Ruble Crawford 
Features Editor 



Strings Brass. Woodwinds. 
Percussion. A piano A harp What do 
all of these things have in common? 
They are all integral parts of Fort 
Wayne's own Philharmonic. 

If you are a music lover, but have 
never bad the opportunity to see the 
Philharmonic perform, then it is a 
trip thai you should consider making 
The enjoyment of classical and con- 
temporary music is not just for the 
"upper class" or the "stuffy" — it's 
something that people of all ages and 
all walks of life can learn to appreci- 
ate. 

There are several ways to see the 
Philharmonic perform 1 recently 
attended an unusual performance — a 
dress rehearsal. 

On September 12, (he 
; Philharmonic held an informal dress 
rehearsal to practice for its opening 
night, on September 13 at the 
Embassy Theatre. Under the direc- 
: tion of Conductor Edvard Tchivzhel, 
the Philharmonic launched into 
Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, 
Op, 35 and Rachmaninoff's 
Symphonic Dances, Op. 45. 

From the opening notes to the 
; last strains, the performance was 
; both exciting and interesting A deep 
; love of music was evident in the 
emotional playing techniques of the 
players, which numbered approxi- 
mately 100 for this rehearsal. Some 
of the players swayed during the 
sometimes violent crescendos in the 
music. Others wore very intense 
looks that added more depth to the 
musical story that was being created. 
Strings also provided an impres- 
sive visual effect, allowing the audi- 
ence to see music being made, rather 
than simply bearing many separate 
instruments. 

The movements of the 
Philharmonic's conductor were 
exciting to watcb. Conductor Edvard 
Tchivzhel's movements were some- 
times fluid, sometimes sharp, but 
always filled with intensity and emo- 
tion. He made constructive com- 
ments to respective sections and 
instruments throughout the rehearsal, 
and also joked with the musicians on 
various occasions. 

"The composer, the conductor. 



and the artist, are all combining their 
talents to convey a feeling that can- 
not necessarily be expressed in 
words The ultimate intimate com- 
munication of feeling is through 
music," said Sean MacBryde. 
Director of Marketing and Public 
Relations for the Philharmonic 

MacBryde adds, "An artist is not 
just explaining what be or she is feel- 
ing, but helping you experience the 
same emotions so you can truly 
understand the statement being 
made. It is not a direct communica- 
tion in that they are trying to make a 
statement of fact, rather it is a shared 
emotion that is to be revered." 

The sound of each piece was 
made even more impressive by the 
atmosphere that the spectacularly 



remodeled Embassy Theatre provid- 
ed. The elaborately sculptured walls 
and ceilings are accented by mauves 
and pale blues that seem to enhance 
the sounds emanating from the stage. 
It's hard not to be impressed with the 
beauty that surrounds you as you lis- 
ten to the stage performance. 

The Fort Wayne Philharmonic 
was as much a pleasure to watch as it 
was to bear. The Philharmonic's 
excellent reputation seems well- 
deserved If you are a music lover. 
then the Philharmonic is a fantastic, 
inexpensive way to spend an 
evening. 

Tickets for all Fort Wayne 
Philharmonic events are available at 
the Embassy Theatre Box Office at 
424-5665.

Head to head with No 
The Greek' Beckley 



Washing another load . . . 



Still Willi a winning record of 16-1 1 
(last week 7-6), I will prognosticate 
again this week . Yes I know 1 
blew the Eagles/Cowboys game, but 
it was fixed Fixed, I icll ya, fixed 
The ofTicial just happened not to see 
one of [be Eagles linemen touch thai 
fourth down pass by Aikmen 
Ooops. 

Game of the Week 
Miami al Tampa Bay 
A baidc for Florida, that doesn't 
involve college teams . go figure 
Tampa Bay will begin the season 4- 

by beating the confused Phins. The 
Phins ain't even sure if they can 
have an aging, legless-fat boy at QB 
anymore. 

Prediction: Tampa Bay by 7 
Worth Watching 
Atlanta at San Francisco 
For some reason, the Falcons give 
San Fran a battle every rime they 
play them No one can understand it, 
least of all me. But this one is at 3- 
Com (wherever thai is) Park. The 
Niners should stomp at home. 
Prediction: San Francisco by 10 

Pittsburgh al Jacksonville 

Mark Brunei! is still out. Kordell has 

had a week to get healthy To borrow 

a phrase from myself "Do the 

Maih!" 

Prediction: Pittsburgh by S 

Kansas City at Carolina 

K.C still is an enigma this year, but 

1 think the Panthers have figured 
ihem out. Look for Collins to out- 
shine Elvis 

Prediction: Carolina by 6 

Minnesota at Green Bay 
The Vikings fell to the Pewier war- 
riors of Tampa last week so they 
should be sort of pissed and be ready 
for revenge. But it just ain't gonna 
happen. 
Prediction: Green Bay by 7 

May Hold- your attention 
Oakland at New York Jets 
Will the Jets double their win output 
from last year? Oh yeah. Still no 
spinal injury for Baby Boy George. 
Prediction: Jets by 2 



Indianapolis at Buffalo 
There are two reasons to watch this 
game. The first, NBC will be forcing 
us "Hoosiers" into watching our 
"home team" even though they 
suck. All the bandwagon Colt fans 
from two years ago, where arc you? 
Prediction: Buffalo by 21 

Chicago at New England 
Another regional team, the league 
wants to force down the throat of us 
near The "Winless City." Rick 
Mirer will start for the Bears this 
week, but the "new dimension" he 
will add to the offense, shouldn't be 
taken loo seriously 
Prediction: New England by 20 

Rest of the field 
Detroit at New Orleans 
So F-ing What! The only reason 
anyone knows the Saints have a 
team this year is because Ditka 
coaches them. Detroit still has Barry 
Sanders to run circles around the 
Ainls for four quarters 
Detroit by 7 

Cinnrinalii al Denver 
The Broncos in a runaway. This is a 
battle to sec who has the ugliest uni- 
forms. This one has to be a tie. 
Denver by 28 

New York Giants at Sl Louis 
I'd rather watch Ally McBeal 
because both these pathetic teams 
should finish ai the bottom of the 
division. Don't expect too much 
from either 
Giants by 4 

San Diego at Seattle 

Warren Moon, still on Social 

Security, will lead the Hawks to the 

W column. 

Seattle by 3 

Worst Game or the Week 

Baltimore al Tennessee 
I will never forgive An Modell for 
moving the Brown from the Dawg 
Pound. I hope be bums in hell for 
eternity Modell is a schmuck and 
when be dies, I will dance on his 
spit-covered grave 
Baltimore by 2 



Dirtu laundry: Tony laux 



With all that has happened this past 
week in sports, I just couldn't decide 
what issue to write on so I decided 
to write a collage of sports: 

*Purdue has beaten Notre Dame for 
ihe first time in 11 years. Purdue's 
quarterback, Billy Dickcn, sliced up 
Ihe Notre Dame secondary like he 
was OJ at a family reunion. The 
Irish offense was anemic and isn't it 
ironic Ibat Jim Colleilo can't win at 
Ross-Adc Stadium even when he is 
playing Purdue instead of coaching 
them? 

Tampa Bay is 3-0 and has lo be 
considered a legitimate contender 
for Ihe NFC Central title During 
the NFL draft Mel Kiper Jr. com- 
mented that Warrick Dunn was a 
reach for the Buccaneers but Tony 
Dungy could be laughing all of way 
to the NFC Championship game. 



•The hype for Griffey to reach 61 
home runs in (he last 19 games was 
so huge you couldn't get away from 
it. Now that there are only 10 games 
left and he has 52 homer's he should 
just listen to Sinatra and "swing 
baby " You have got a six game lead 
over the Angels. Just do it!! 

*The Bears and Colts are both win- 
less and things don't look like they 
are going to get any better. Rashaan 
Salaam's season ending injury could 
shed a bright spot on the Bears, At 
least he won't be fumbling every 
other Umc he gets the ball. Colts 
fans, even though your team hasn't 
scored an offensive touchdown in 
the first three games, chances are 
this trend won't continue. Even 
Ibougb you are depending on 
Marshall Faulk and Jim Hartjaugh lo 
bring you through this crisis. 






*Pete Rose has publicly stated that 
this will be ihe year that he will seek 
reinstatement to the game of base- 
ball This application for the lifting 
of the "lifetime" ban will occur 
sometime before the end of the year 
according lo Rose's statements 
This will make him eligible for the 
trip to Cooperstown and being able 
lo manage again. ESPN reported 
sources close to Bud "Lite" Selig 
thai he would never lift the ban. If 
we can forgive people like Steve 
"Give me ihe Keys" Howe and 
Dwight "Snortin"' Gooden we can 
forgive an illegal gambler, can'l we? 

•Whether you hate him or love him 
you have to appreciate ihe effort by 
Eric "Lazarus" Davis of Ihe 
Baltimore Orioles. After having a 
cancerous tumor removed in his 
colon and undergoing weeks of 



energy-sapping chemotherapy he 
made his triumphant return to base- 
ball going 0-3 in five innings of 
play It turned oul lo be a double 
celebration because the Orioles 
clinched the first playoff berth. 

•The city of Seattle will be the talk 
of the country for the next few 
weeks. First, the #7 Nebraska 
"three yards and a cloud of dust" 
Huskers will arrive this weekend to 
play P2 Washington "Sucksters" 
The Manners will open against the 
Orioles in the first round of the play- 
offs which probably means this 
series will represent the American 
League in Ihe World Series Finally, 
the question of whether Shawn 
"Jack" Kemp will report to Ihe 
Sonics training camp or not. 
Wouldn't Kemp look good in a 
Pacers uniform? 



T.W.I.P. (This Week at IPFW) Notes 



Bv Tony Laux 
Sports Editor 



Womens Volleyball: The winning 
streak has hit 28 straight home 
games with a three game sweep this 
weekend. The team was coming off 
of a lough five set loss to Wayne 
Stale University so the pressure lo 
continue the winning tradition at 
home might have been too much lo 
handle. Instead of folding however. 
ihe ladies went on ihe attack with a 
vengeance. Led by Andi Reichart 
and Dottie Porch the Ladydons 
completed a very successful week- 
end with three set sweeps of all or 
their opponents. 

Tennis: The surprise team of the 



Great Lakes Valley Conference 
(GLVC&gt; continues to rack up the 
victories with the 5-2 defeat of 
Kentucky Wesleyan on Sunday 
Dawn Crayer, Jenna Harmeyer, and 
Becky Bermes led the team with 
three singles wins which sealed the 
rain shortened match and raised 
their record to a whopping 7- 1 over- 
all and 5-0 in the GLVC. 

Cross Country: Adam Barton 

placed 10th and helped lead the 
mens cross country team to an 
eighth place finish out of eleven 
teams at the IPFW Cross Country 
Classic this weekend. Chad 
Clevcnger rebounded from a tough 
race at the University of Southern 
Indiana (USD and placed 36th with 
Matt Beckley finishing .55 seconds 
behind him for 37th place. Kelli 
Kunkel placed 31st for the womens 



cross country team helping them to 
post an eighth place finish oul of len 
learns. The womens team, which 
did not have enough runners to 
score ai USI, fielded a full team for 
the first lime. With the addition of 
Cindy Beineke and other runners, 
moving higher in the standings 
should not be a problem. Both 
teams will be in action this Friday ai 
the Manchester College Invitational 

Soccer Winless in the first three 
games of the year, including two 
shutouts, was not in the preseason 
hopes for mens soccer Coach Terry 
Stefankiewicz. IPFW has lost to 
RJPU1, tied Findley, and Jamie 
Zellar scored the only goal against 
Ashland in a 2-1 loss. I Ik- team will 
try to change its luck with a week- 
end tournament in Indianapolis 
playing Kentucky Wesleyan on 



Friday ai 5 p.m. and Saturday 
against MeKendree College on 
Saturday al 3:30 pm 

Mens Baseball: Coach Vutori leads 
his mens baseball team into its fall 
season with a doubleheader this 
weekend wilb at the Indiana 
Institute of Technology at 1 p.m 



Womens Softball: IPFW womens 
softball will continue their fall sea- 
son with three games at Tri-State 
University at the games are sched- 
uled for 9 a.m., 11 a.m , and 1 p.m. 
Last weekend Stacie Guthrie had 
four nils in the first game of the dou- 
bleheader while Leslie Stamets 
went the distance for a 9-0 three hit 
shutout win while the second game 
was an 0-5 loss where inexperience 
reared its head after the win
