Chancellor Michael Wancll in an infi 

tion and answer stssion last Tuesilay afternoon. 

Questions directed at Wanell and Dean of 
Sludcnls Donna Bialik. who helped Wanell in 
responding, focused on recurrent issues pcitinenl 
to Ihe IPFW campus and communily. 

Inquiries were made in(o the importance 
and value of professor evaluations, (he move lo 
Division 1 and what il means to the umvenily 
and student involvement in campus groups and

Ihe move would mean a number of bcnerits foi 
I lalk 10 the school and its studenLt Wanell added. In par- 

' licular, he said that in Ihe fuliuc, men's toskel- 

ball would begin lo compete against big name 
teams, meaning more recognition for both our 
players and our sehool. 

The move to Division I will also allot more 
athletic scholarships, as well as a possible reno- 
vation of the Gales Spons Center, which some 
sludenu at the Session said could be improved 
with newer, more comprehensive weight and aer- 
obii» rooms and more basketball and racquelball

banquet featured inlernalional looOs, perfnrmantiQs and programs Irom the inlemalion- 
al student populaiion. 



He added, however, that Ihc problem most 
likely was rot Ihe lack of.high quality evenl* like 
plays, lectures and concerts, nor a variety of stU' 
dent groups. 

Wanell also mentioned a number of campus 
announcement. He said that PBS Channel 39 
will be moving its studio operations lo the IPFW 
campus. The administration was also looking 
into developing a food coun with several brand 
name, fast food style eateries. The food coon 
would hkely be located in Walb Union where the

that a form of computerized advising that would

dents may also be implemented

Herpes survivor starts support group 



Fort Wayne has not had a support group for 
herpes and human papillomavirus IHPVi infect- 
ed individuals in more than a decade But as of 
this week, that will change. 

Through the efforts of beipes survivor 
Laura Iwho asked thai we not use her full name), 
a new support group for individuals mfectcd with 
the herpes and HPV STDs has been foimcd. 

The support group it named ihe Fort Wayne 
Herpes Educational Living Prognm and HPV, or 
HELP for short. 

Laura, who has been living with genital her- 
pes for Ihc past five years, stoned the group to 
serve a number of purposes. Namely, it will edo- 
cjte participants on the facts of the diseases, as 
v.c1l as provide an oultel for emotional support 
and healing. 

Laura stressed that the emotional impact 



How herpes is contracted: Skin-to- 
skin contact 

Symptoms: Blisters, rashes or sores 
in the genital and facial area; some- 
times aches in the genital area 
Treatment: Medications to help 
cure blisters and sores; 
incurable 



people eipenence when they discover they have 
contracted herpes is "incredibly great." 

"People portray il as a plague." she said. 
Carriers feel as if Ihey arc "diny" or "damaged 
goods." Often, they think their lives are over and 
that Ihey will never be able to have a relationship 

Stereotypes and misconceptions of herpes 
and HPV abound. In reality, however, herpes 
does not mean imminent death oi the end of any 
chance for relation.ships. 

"In mosi ca^cs. il is manageable." Laura 
said. Although no cure for the virus eiists. earn- 
ers can lake medicauon lo help heal outbreaks of 
sores caused by herpes and HPV. Carriers often 
can go on to have healthy, fulfilling lives. Having 
herpes. Laura added, docs not mean that you can- 
not have children. 

The support group, which had its first mecl- 
ing last night, will meet every second Wednesday 
from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. and every fourth Saturday 
from 7 to 9 p.m. 

Meetings arc held at Park Center, 909 Easi 
State Boulevard, Anyone desinng more informa- 
tion can call to hear a recorded mesiage about the 
group at 219-181-2890- A website for the group 
can be visited at www.fthetp-hpv.com. 

There is no cost lo attend meetings. 
Parucipants will be required to sign confidential- 
ity agreements to ensure that the identities of 
those who anend will remain anonymous. 

Guest speakers are scheduled lo lecture at 
several of the meetings to further educate 

Estimates place the number of herpes and 



HPV earners al nearly 5.5 million m ihe United 
States, meaning Ihal between one in Tveandone 
in four Ameriians have herpes. Laura said. The 
disease IS pariicularly prevalent among the 19 lo 
34-year-old age group, one of the largest groups 
on this campus and at many colleges and 

and facial area, as well as sores in the genital 
region. It is usually contracted through tkin-on- 
skin contact with someone who has Ihedisease. It 
is not contracted Ihrough blood, saliva or odier 
body fluids. 

There are numerous ways lo gel help or

list of useful numbers and websites follows.

Opinions 



Consider 
This... 



"My gul reacuon n Ihit n't unforturule that il*i come 
down lo Ihis Some tnembers of the Election Boaid have mi^eil 
feelinp about how it came ouL Evefylhmg wis goitig fine until 
(hii lul week.. I did ailviu: Busch and Millet iboul copyright and 
(nuIemiKk iiiuei, and told (hem what ihey were doing was at per- 
ianal nifc." --Loii Btih Royte. Director ofStudenI Life 

"I was confidenl ihal Ihc sluUenl body's voice would be 
upheld and I'm proud to be then new president. All questions con- 
cerning the atlcmpled disqualification by a few individuals I direct 
you 10 (he leller by the Dean of Students." -Jusiin Buirli, ne^ly 
elected Fresidenl vj Sludeni Body 



"I cannot commcnl on whether Busch or Miller violated 
(he Student Code of Conduct by their use of logos in the recent 
IPSGA elections. They have rights lo due process and educational 
privacy. 

However, hypothetically speaking, it is debatable whether 
the academic misconduct section of (he Code applies lo acts of aca- 
demic dishonesty associntcd with IPFW courses and not with 
cocurricular activities. Also, in the Academic Regulations section 
of the IPFW Undergraduate Bulletin, plagiarism is clearly defined 
as: 'a form of cheating in which the work of someone else is 
olfeied asoiw's own. The language or ideas thus taken from anoth- 
er may range from isolated sentences, or paragraphs, to entire arti- 
cles copied from printed sources, speeches, software, ot the work 
of other students.' Dictionary definition of plagiarism also indi- 
cates 'that an net of plagiarism involves representation of someone 
else's idea or thou^t at one's own. This condition of 'misrepre- 
senution' may not apply m a case such as the one under consider- 
ation. Acts of academic misconduct such as plagiarism are 'pun- 
ishable.' 

However, in those cases where the E&gt;can of Students has 
authority lo initiate disciplinary action for an act of academic mis- 
conduct, e.g., repeat offenses of academic dishonesty or facilitating 
the ai;ademic dishonesty of a student in a clas,s in whic"- •■- 
accused student is enrolled, the Dean of Students will consul 
(he Dean or Director of the school or division in which die accused 
student is enrolled and/or give due consideration to the n 
frequency of the alleged misconduct. And if disciplinary 
e.g. probation or suspension from IPFW is proposed it wil 
a mind lowatd making the sanction propooionalc to the i 

This said, regardless of which section or imicle of the 
IPFW Student Code may or may not apply to a case of a student 
using a logo in a student election without the company's permis 
sion IPFW certainly docs not condone the use of a company' 
lugo-in eithe) an IPFW cunicular activity or an IFPW cocurricu 
lar activity- without obtaining the permission of the companj 
Whether IPRV academic or disciplinary sanction is appropriate i 
such a case depends upon the totality of the ' 
involved." -Donna BialiK Diar\ of Sludenli. in c

the decision made by the Election Board, then why have one? It 
me diat in reading the article, the two officials. Bialik 
and Koyse. were not included in the decision process and have 
decided to pull their weight and make decisions for the students. 

1 don't wart to see student officials who just say "yes" lo 
whatever the university tells them. I want someone who will do 
what is right. NOT what can gain diem popularity. The universi- 
ty has to remember that students pay die tuition, which generates 
substantial revenue to die university, and we should be allowed 
to decide who would be the best candidates for student affairs.

In Memory of.. 



Les changed my life, he gave me the 
opportunity to teach, and for that, I will be 
forever grateful.--/?ic/!ard Papazian, pro- 
fessor of visual arts 



Leslie P. Motz 



I 



Students were number one with Les; he 
absolutely loved the students. They v 
first. -'Dennis Krist, assistant professor 
and interim chair of visual arts 



What 1 felt about Les is he's a craftsman 
that will live in all of us that worked with 
him. --Robert Murray, associate professor 
of computer art and design 



I've known him since about '85. I never 
had a class with him but he was my advis- 
er the last couple of years. I guess the 
thing I remember most about him is how 
encouraging he's always been. He's 
always encouraged me to stick with it and 
keep working on it. I'm now graduating 
next spring and going onto graduate 
school, and [ feel his motivation was 
instrumental in keeping me going. -Linda 
Casegonya. senior 




ftofessor Motz was friend, colleague, teacher 
and mentor. His passing is a great loss for each 
of us as individuals, for that was how he 
befriended us. If you knew Les. you knew him 
as a teller of wonderfully human stories and 
immense generosity. Thankfully, his legacy will 
continue through the many initiatives he put 
! forth in his 40 years with arts education in Fort 
AVayne, -AnnMane LeBlanc, deparsmenl oj 
wisuai arts 



He was the first person I contacted in the depart- 
menl when I was hired recently. He Was a son of 
a father figure, and showed me the ropes on 
becoming a full-time professor. He gave me a lot 
of information about the history of this depart- 
ment, which is quite lengtliy. -Dana Goodman, 
assistant professor of sculpture 



He was my adviser until he retired last 
year. He was a very kind man. I was very 
nervous when I came to college, about if I 
could handle this. When I came here to 
schedule my classes, he instantly put me at 
ease. Because he was so kind to me I 
began to believe this would all work out. 
He really went out of his way to make the 
students feel like he cared. -Teri Whitaker. 
iunior 



Phoio by Man S/iaffefj 
Les Motz was born April 12, 1936 and died April 5. 2001. | 



1 told Les one day that I was going to teach 
myself how to solder. He said, "Come on over 
and I'll show you." I signed up for classes two 
to three years ago and am still enjoying it. So I 
look at Les as having made my later years very, 
very enjoyable. Sharon Jokay. student 



Les was a very generous person. He was respected by 
all of his students, faculty and everybody who knew 
him. He was a good artist. -Gary Lanier, secretary oJ 
the Dean's Office of Visual and Performing Arts 



Les was one of the reasons I started at IPFW. He 
helped to transfer credits from another college, and 
helped me to decide on my major. He was a man who 
was truly for the students. He was a rarity and will be 
missed. --Meg Hanold. Junior Fine Arts 



was in school from 1982-86 when Motz was a 
teacher and I've been in school here since 1997. 
He was a very good teacher and chair of fine 
arts. I will miss him. --Karen Schneider, Senior 



I knew Les ever since he was at the Fort Wayne Arts 
School, He's probably the nicest, kindest man I ever 
met. And he loved to talk about art. When you talked 
to Les, you'd better have had half an hour.. .he'll be 
sorely missed. -Kris Bradley, senior 



Les Motz's passing represents a significant loss 
to the campus. He helped build IPFW by lob- 
bying Indiana State legislators to have the Fort 
Wayne Art Institute merge with IPFW. 
Personally, I have lost a colleague and good 
friend. --Chancellor Michael Wartell 



Les Motz was a very fine person who 
cared not only for the art department'' 
success but had a genuine love for the stu 
dents. I, along with so many, will miss him 
greatly. -Marilyn Bock Tobolski, 
associate faculty 



Les Motz was the kind ot person who remembered 
everyone he met. It is our turn now to remember him 
in our thoughts. He was always there if you had 
question or just wanted to talk. He took the time to 
care. 1 will always remember how he helped me and 
I hope everyone else will do the same. -Courtney 
Ujuari Nardia. senior 



He took care of problems quickly and effi- 
ciently. He also was good-natured and really 
cared about his students and staff. —Renee 
Gilbert, figure model and MA student oj 
English and Linguistics 



Les was an amazing artist and person. He will 
be missed greatly. -Jf/i year Fine Arts student

THe malch proved to be 
very close and interesting, with 
both teams wooing the referees. 
wiping up the floor numerous 

and wild volleys. 

After the Dons won the 
first game 3t^28, Quincy saw 
the urgency and prepared to 
lake the setond game. With 
IPFW up 28-26, JcfTPlak didn't 
play a Qumcy dink, watching it 
hit jusi inside the line (o put 
Quincy within one al 28-27. 

Quincy then missed a 
block lo put the Dons lo game

referees didn't help Ihc Dons

Defensively, IPFW was

If Ihc U«lleydons continue 
playing like they played against 
Quincy and again on SatunJay 
night in a 30-26. 30-21, 30-24 
victory over Clarke College, the 
season could last several weeks 
beyond Ihe regular season finale 
which will be played against 
Ball State on April 14. at Gales 
Sporu Center. 

The Dons look to knock 
off Ball Slale at home on 
Salunlay, April 14 and a full set 
of bleachers would be a very 
nice touch, Il makes for a very 
cheap dale, as admission is free . 
with a valid student ID. 



MLB 2001 forgetaboutit 



Well, here we are Ihe Start of Ihe 
2001 Major League Baseball reason, and 
1 have one thing to say: the Yankees will 
win il all. I know this probably sounds 
like a broken record to most of you. but 
it is a simple tact that Earth would spin 
off lis aiis if the Bronx Bombers didn't 
hoist Ihc hardware (for those of you who 
don't know spons, that means the cham- 
pionship trophy), 

1 just can't take it anymore. I mean, 
listen to the Yankees' starting folation', 
there's Roger Clemens. Andy Pelile. 
Mike Mus.sina. Orlando Hernandez and 
well, il really docsn'l mailer who is 
pitching the fifth day, because when you 
win four out of five, no one can touch 
yiiu. Of Ihe four pltchcn named above. 



they have all won al least 17 games in a player as much as they want in the off

As for their balling order. 
Il's just full of clutch hitters like Chuck win

They are by far Ihe richest franchise 
in sports history. They can basically get 
any player they want by trading away lal- 
cnl in Iheit fann syilem or by paying a 



Sieinbrenner keeps in his sock drawer, to 
other learns, it's ihe difference between a 
proFit and a loss. 

So, once again we will be forced to 
watch Ihc Yankees walw ihcir way lo 
another World Series victory, while the 
rest of us just sit back and hope for neil 
year. Of course. Ihcre really is no hope 
and after the final game, you will sii in 
your chair with your drink, watching a 
mound of pin-striped Yankees jump on 
each other, celebrating yet anotho' cham- 
pionship. Then, just about as you're 
about to turn the channel because you're 
sick of watching Joe Torre cry, you'll see 
Jeter took in the camera, raise his finger 
to signify that they are number one and 
say. "I'm going lo Disney World." 

At thai point. I will simply break 
down and cry. because I am a die-hard 
Boston Red Sok fan.
