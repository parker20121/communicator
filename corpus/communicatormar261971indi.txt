OOE-'RE lOOODEPFOL 



Can I, imprisoned, body-bounded, touch 
The starry robe of God, and froni my soul, 
Hy tiny Part, reach forth to his great Whole, 
spread my Little to the infinite Much, 

When Truth forever slips from out my clutch 

And what I take indeed. I do but dole. 

In cupfuls from a rimless ocean-bowl 

That holds a million million million such? 

And yet, some Thing that moves among the stars. 

And holds the cosmos in a web of law, 

Moves too in me: a hunger, a quick thaw 

or soul that liquefies the ancient bars. 

As I, a member of creation, sing 

The burning oneness binding everything. 



And

Far kypocrasy and ironic hu- 
moar you just can'l beat' "Anlis 
Doles" by dear Utile Tina in 
your March 19 issue. Tina's colum 
has consistently been on par ivilh 
a 7th grade sheet but her 

latest effort hit a new low for pre- 
judiced ignorance. I can think of a 
number of terms to describe her in- 
sults to student government in gen- 
eral and student body president 
Scoll Gillie inparticular, but I 
suppose the words slander or libel 
will suffice. 

What makes all of this so fun- 
ny is that last week these people 
(on your staff) indulged in an orgy 
of self-pity and self-rightecusness 
concerning other people who criti- 
cize their newspaper, but who, 
they alleged, just sal back and 
didn't get involved; this week 
march 19) they have done to stu- 
dent government exactly what they 
complained about in the previous 
week. 

Jennifer, I also want you to 
know that your headline for the 
student government article 

"Siuden 



this week. (The arliclc about ibe 
baby with the Uvcr defect was- 

I don't think it was worth the space, 
2nd 1 hope everyo 



. but 



■mpus 



n't). 



Instead of "Anils Doles", which is 
so much wasted space, why don't 
you let your student government re- 
porter use that space for an edi- 
torial devoted to discussing the 
pros and cons of student govern- 
ment policies and actions. After 
all, how many students know the 
provisions of the new Student 
Body Constitution, the Student 
Bill of Rights or the proposed Cam- 
pus Parliament? Instead of making 
cute comments that are in poor 
taste concerning the adminis- 
Irations's paid parking policies, why 
not do some in depth reporting and 
try to come up with an expose if 
ils possible? 

What I'm trying to say is in- 
stead of using the newspaper as a 
personal toy, why not try to be res- 
ponsible to the student body. 
After all, they foot the bill to the 
tune of t6,€00 in Student Activity 
Fee money this year.

your newspaper 



ailed 

"Student Government Kewspaper" 
but rather "Student Newspaper." 
What you would like to see and 
what we really are, are two dif- 
ferent things.

ANITS 

Dear Tina (And whomever 






■"t 



DOTES 

t answer thoughtless 






IF Ay can't the Communica tor 
present constructive criticism on 
editorial policies? 

Little intelligence and time is 
needed to criticize an issue or 
mock a group; to lake a sland 
which will offer responsible and 
solutions requires insight and com- 
petence. Show a little integrity 
by trying to improve the situation 
rather than just laughing at it. 



Presenting humorous little 
"anli's dates" is easy, bat what; 
is accomplished? 
Tommy Meneely-Janei i/eavei 
Dear Tommy, Janet, and otriEi dis- 
satisfied members of our news- 
paper staff: 

In answering a question such 
as the one presented above, one 
could immediately put up a def- 
ense and become belligerent at the 
same time. However, one should 



responsibilitywith the same (Gen. 
3:13 or something like that). It is 
too bad that the writers of this let- 
ter cannot distinguish between this 
column (and its author) and the edi- 
torial policies of the Communicator. 
This column is not editorial (tho 
my opinions and others do come in- 
to view at tiines)-'-it is a place for 
seeking advice, consolation, and 
answers to curious question!. 

This is my column and I will 
write it as I see fit (with some 
HELPFUL criticism from the more 
intelligent members of our staff 
and from my friends). 

Knowing myself (and as others 
know me) this column reflects my 
attitudes and my own personality. 

Any criticism of my optimism, 
"ever present smile" and sense of 
humor should be dicected to me per- 
sonally. 

Hiss Athena Marie Miller 
(better known as Tina) 



after missed deadlines, a "sorry, 
no time," etc, -well, should we 
leave the space blank in memory of 
them!— Mr. Gillie used to write for 
the paper-that ended the same way. 
Mr. Nusbaumer and Mr. Akey wrote 
the ever-popular "Barbed Wire" 
which fizzled due to "no time to 
work on it." I don't blame these 
people-there is an acute lack of 
time now. But don't blame us, 
either. 

Point 4. ..After all, how many stu- 
dents CARE about the provisions 
of the proposed Student Body Con- 
stitution, the Student Bill of 
Rights (which we are running in 
segments in the paper) or the Cam- 
pus Parliaments Yet we are re- 
porting it, dear. 



Point 5... What I'm trying to say, 
Mr. Pettyjohn, is: Nobody expected 
the paper to survive, point oj fact-' 
Nobody wanted it to survive, leF 
alone have it start up {first issue 
couldn't be published until Ocotber, 
1969 because the Publications 
Board just couldn't get appointed 
and together before then). Nobody 
has ever wanted us to be respon- ' 
sible to the Student Body except 
for that minority group known as 
Student Government. 

Point 6. ..6,0Q0 dollars is relatively 
lower than what quite a number of 
"organizations" on this campus 
received. After all, somebody has 
to spend it and why should Student 
Government leaders get paid, or 
lave paid typists, or have 2 elec- 
tric typewriters, or another phone, 
or paid conventions? 

Let's spread it around, Stevie. 
After all, haven't you been a lit- 
tle one-sided during your college 
life? Why not look around and set 
that those arc REAL PEOPLE 
who helped -elect you to office " 
years ago; that there are REAL 
PEOPLE who fill out your opinion 
polls: and that there are REAL 
PEOPLE who support your frater- 
nity. 

Not everybody wants what

Dear Editor 

Whenever 1 get put -to PIT to a 
play, I try to pick up a copy of 
your paper; so I did that today. 
Your lead story and photo of the 
O'Neill play cerniinfy'didh'f'd-o '" 
much to promote an audience. 
Twenty-five persons, only a few of 
whom were students. And the play 
was exceptionally well done. What 
is the matter with the student body? 
All the talk about drugs, alcohol, 
sex, guilt complex, and generation 
gap (which young people think 
NEW with this .generation.'} are 
dealt with, in a very vivid fashion 
on your own stage-wilh practically 
no one in the audience. What a 

Same one isn't lioing a very 
good job of "Communications"; or 
else there are those who want to 
rant and rave, without learning 
what others have said in plays 
dealing with the ideas which some 
think so NEW. My point? There is 
much to be learned, during the col- 
lege years, from music, plays, and 
the varied activities, NOT found in 
the lecture' hall or class room. 

Your news about "150,000 for 
the purpose of exposing youngsters 
to live theater" seemed more-tkan 
a little Iroriic, as I read it in the 
nearly empty theater between acts 
of a superior performance of some 
very talented young actors.

PINTO 

Survey 

Results 

Remember the survey that was 
taken last semester on the Ford 
"Pinto"? Well the results were 
released by the I.U. Division of 
Business here at the Fort Wayne 

The classes conducting the 
survey found that the Pinto appeals 
to the single male or female that 
has an annual income of S5000 to 
18000. Furthermore, the Pinto 
appeals to the teacher, the secre- 
tary, and the blue collar worker. 

The 833 people who were sur- . 
veyed liked the styling of the car, 
the comfort, quality of workman- 
ship, and the anticipated repair 

Dr. Marjoric Person and Wil- 
liam G. Heller were in charge of 
the classes conducting the survey 
here. There were also 160 schools 
in the nation taking the survey. 

More power to the Pinto!

Introducing lU-PV's "Bunny of the Month", Harvey. Conlributioa project 

sponsored by Alpha Psi Omega. 

New committee may be formed for students 



lay 
to express grievances 

Through cooperation with Dr, 
Rue Johnson, Academic Dean of 
Indiana University, on Academic 
Affairs Advisory Committee has 
been proposed. This council will 
consist of a repteienlalive from the 
Arts &amp; Sciences, Education, Busi- 
ness &amp; Music divisions. 

The council's objective will be 
to serve to provide student input and 
feedback to the dean. The infomia- 
tion provided by this committee will 
aid the deon to make administrative 
decisions of academic natures. 

This advisory committee may 
serve to implement a mechanism for 
all students to obtain satisfaction 
of grievances about instructors and 
courses. The council will also pro- 
vide a mechanism through which 
students may participate in curri- 
culum planning, progrom develop- 
ment and other academic matters. 

The four students will initially 
be appointed by the Student Body 
President. 

If the board proves success- 



against instructors 

for students in each division to e- 
lect members to ^e council. 

This proposed advisory board 
would be restricted to Indiono Uni- 
versity. When the new academic 
deon for Purdue is selected, there 
will be attempts to form o similar 
council for Purdue. 

In o memorand um to Student 
Body President Scott Gillie, Dr. 
Johnson soid^ "I see the primary 
function of this committee to be the 
promotion of communication and un- 
derstanding. It will be most helpful 
to me to heor directly from students 
their concerns regarding academic 
matters and to receive constructive 
suggestions. No doubt as we meet, 
additional positive functions of the 



Bill of Student Rights 

and Responsibilities 

This is one pare in a series ot the "Bill of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities." As you read it. please keep in mind thii this U

tion of and extension of those rights to the, individual student

In oddition to the rights and responsibilities enumer- 
oted herein, it is contingent to the protection of the inter- 
ests of students ond the inslilulion that procedural due pro-

There anee was an office— iby 4 

Which housed at least 40or more. 

With no success an office did staffers try to find 

because they were always handedo line. 

Dean Keller, Lanli, and other student-minded faculty too, 
Gave us "that look" and a "ha-ha" on you. 

So here we are in our insufferable hole, 

with seven other offices (probably heated by coal). 

Yet we smile and pray ihalwe won't desist, 

for we figure that this crjisade's run-around will persist.

DORMS COMING TO 

lUPUFWRC? 



Erdt- 



Diiring the past i'A months 
Dick Baron, Secretary oI the Inter- 
ior of the Students Gov. 
has been working with Or. 
mann. Dr. Olson, Dr. Boswell, . 
Mr. Gordon Wakefield io formulating, 
administering, and compiling a 
dormitory survey laken last January, 
during registration, by 2,619 full- 
time l.U. students. 

ffhy was this survey taken? 
Rick Baron, in his capacity as a 
liason between various faculty 
members and the Studcuts* Govern- 
ment was speaking with Dr. Erdt- 
mann* concerning the possibility of 
dorms at the Regioaal Campus and 
. what effects (if any) these residen- 
tial facilities would have on the 
student populus. 

After much deliberation, Hick 
decided that he would conduct a 
survey to see just how extensive 
the favoribility was to have dormi- 
tories on this campus. 

Dr. Arnold Olson, head of the 
Sociology department at l.U. Fort 
Wayne, helped Mr. Baron in draw- 
ing up the format to be used for 
this survey, because it was neces- 
sary (0 have a questionnaire which 
was free from any ambiguities, 
slantings, overlapings, or the like. 

The survey was then admin 
istered. Some of the interesting and 
important results follow: 

Are you in favor of having resi- 
dential facilities at this campus? 

ApproK. 70% Yes or 1750 people 
Approic. 30% No or 900 people 

Would you live in a dormitory 
at the Regional Campus if one were 
available to you? 

Approx. 15% Yes or 400 people 
Approx. 35% No or 2200 people 

Would you still choose the 
the dormitory if its costs exceeded 
your present housing expenses by

Another major reason to have 
dormitories at this campus is re- 
lated to that one hig word... 
APATHY. Why don't people seem 
to care about what goes on at this 
campus? Why do too many people 
leave ttia campus for Bloomington 
^r Lafayette who after just one 
year at l.U.-P.U. Regional Campus? 
Why are most club memberships so 
low that they can barely slay alive? 
The reason or rather the word is 
apathy. 

As Rick Baron puts it, "As 
long as you have a college only in 
name, in other words an upper 
educational high school with 4000 
students-I think that this type of 
unwillingness to get involved is 
anything outside of the scheduled 
scholastic curriculum will prevail." 
He goes ou to aay that "...I am not 
saying that dorms are solely that 
answer, but if residential facilities 
are coupled with our soon to be con- 
structed Student Union Building— 
I believe one will then easily be 
able to detect a new and refreshing 
atmosphere on this campus." 



The PIT article oppeoring on 
the front poge of the March I9lh is- 
sue needs o point of clarification. 
The $150,000 oltocoted by the Ind- 
iana State Arts Commission is for 
all arts projects and not necessar- 
ily limited to one aspect of the 
program. 



Hi there! Well I can hear the 
question now! "What happened to 
the front page? "Where's the news?" 
Well, it's there because— it's YOU! 

Yes, you are the news and the 
news is you. You are real and real 
is you. You are NOW. HERE, and 
VITAL to this campus. 

What better reason is there?

Glass drive

a success! 

Chances are that you have 
heard o[ the recent "glass drive" 
organized by ihe Coalition for the 
Environment. But did you know 
that it WHS a success ? Over 41 
tons of glass, worth some S830.00 
were collected during the three 
day drive ut the two Scotts [GA'e. 
The collection centers were manned 
from 9 to 9 each day hy high school 
and college students alike. Oo 
Thursday, the second day, Purdue 
Faculty wives took over and showed 
thai women were just as capable 
as men in the fight against pollution. 

Drives like this though aren't 
successful without a lot of plan- 
ning and this one took approx- 
imately 7 months. At present no 
other drives are scheduled but a 
repeat is planned eventually. Since 
it is estimated that over SO Ions

lands and the Norwegian Mis. all

drifted.
