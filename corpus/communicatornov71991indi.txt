HIV risk awareness 
crucial for students 
say AIDS expert 



By Chad Resting 

Features Editor 

T.V. special promotes 

teenage HIV tests 

Local ABC aHiliale WPTA-TV recently 
aired an after-school special tilled "In 
the Shadow of Love." This lilm fea- 
tured Ihe topic of AIDS, Specifically, it 
was the story of a teenager who con- 
tracts HIV (Human Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome, Ihe virus that causes 
AIDS.) through sexual contact. While 
ABC's after-school specials are gener- 
ally emotional, yel benign affaits, "In 
the Shadow of Love* had a very differ- 
ent effect. 

Seventy people phoned Ihe Fort 
Wayne-Allen County Board of Health 
within days o( "Shadows'" airing to 
arrange HIV tests. The Board of Health 
appointment dockets were filled for 
weeks, largely with teenagers worried 
about the iisk involved with Iheir sexual 
contacts. Teenagers rarely sought HIV 
tests in the past, and now they came to 
the Board of Health by the dozens. A 
push of the television remote button 
was all it took, "It was incredible," said 
Jeffrey Markley, HIV counselor for the 
Board of Health, "Like nothing we'd 
seen before." 

Now, v/hat will acl as the trigger lor 
IPFW students? Even after some sev- 
en or eight years of public conscious- 
ness of AIDS and its communicable 
nature, the disease continues to 
spread. Studies by Ihe Center for Dis- 
ease Control, and Ihe World Health 
Organization bear out that AIDS is 
spreading fastest among the hetero- 
sexual population, t&gt;oth in the United 



Slates and globally. WHO puis the 
number of confirmed AIDS cases 
worldwide at 200.000 with 140,000 of 
those in the United States. Estimates 
of HIV prevalence range from 800,000 
to 1.2 million. In the United States, the 
rate of infection for homosexuals has 
slowed, while lor the heterosexual 
population the rate has remained 
steady. In short, homosexuals are 
learning to heed the dangers; hetero- 
sexuals have not, according lo WHO, 
The testing procedure explained 

The greatest risk of HIV infection, 
according lo the American Red Cross, 
lies in doing any ot the following; shar- 
ing drug needles or syringes with 
someone who is infected wilh HIV; 
having sex wilh someone who is infect- 
ed with HIV; or putting Ihe tongue or 
moulh on Ihe vagina, penis or teclum 
of someone infected with HIV. 

Without HIV testing, there is no way 
of knowing for certain ii infection is pre- 
sent in anyone's bodily fluids, (Blood, 
semen, vaginal or cervical fluids are 
where HtV is found in the largest pro- 
portions; other fluids, such as tears 
and sweat, can contain HIV, but in 
quantities loo small to be an infectious 
hsk.) 

HIV testing can be obtained al Ihe 
Fort Wayne-Allen County Board of 
Heallh, the American Red Cross, a 
family physician's office, or at a medi- 
cal convenience clinic. The Board ol 
Health lest is free; the Red Cross 
charges $20; and a physician or clinic 
carl «»t-$40 or more,

Program on diabetes 
helps raise awareness 



By Tammy Rasnick 
News Editor 

In celebration ol November as 
National Diabetes Month, a host of 
sponsors held a screening and lun- 
cheon program last Tuesday 

The theme for the day was "The 
unknown killer' because ol the vast 
amount o( people who have the dis- 
ease and are unaware of it. The day's 
activities were sponsored by the Cen- 
ter for Women and Returning Adults, 
American Diabetes Association, Medi- 
cal Personnel Pool, Parkview Regional 
Diabetes Care Cenier, and Lifescan. 

Diabetes is a disease that develops 
vjhen the tiody either does not produce 
enough insulin or may not be able to 
use what is produced. It is a disease 
that affects over 14 million Americans, 
half of v.'hom are undiagnosed. The 
program's goal, according lo Linda 
Johnson, coordinator for the Center for 
Women and Returning Adults, was to 
create awareness. 

The activities for Ihe day included a 
luncheon that was diabelically sourid, 
speakers from the sponsoring organi- 
zations, information about programs 
set up in assisting diabetics, and free 
blood glucose screening. 

Johnson lends the credit of Ihe pro- 
gram to a former student of IPFW. 



'The tireless efforts of Carol Forbes 
has brought it all together," Johnson 
stated. 

The program was the brainchild of 
Forbes, who is an IPFW graduate in 
communication and is also a member 
ol Ihe ADA Forbes started planning 
last June. "My general concern is for 
public education." Forbes said. She fell 
that the more people know about the 
disease, the more they can control, ri, 

Forbes' expectations lor the day were 
simple, "My hope is that more people 
wilt become aware of v^hat diabetes is." 

According lo Theresa Ehinger, direc- 
tor for the Northeast Region ADA, Indi- 
ana tanks 10th out ol all the states in 
diabetic-related deaths. The disease 
creates a cost of 14 billion dollars and 
150,000 lives each year in Ihe United 
States. 

In Indiana alone there are 176,000 
undiagnosed individuals with diabetes. 
Ehinger fell thai Ihe public needs to be 
be aware of the problem, in order to 
deal with it. 

Although there is no cure for dia- 
betes, Forbes is optimistic She is 
excited about the advancements that 
have been made in the last lew years. 
*1 have always believed that they will 
find a cure in my liletime," slated 
Forbes. 



Community service need gets 
students into the streets 



By Tammy RasnIck 
News Editor 

Last Friday IPFW students went out 
Into the Streets by performing commu- 
nity service projects throughout Fort 
Wayne. Into the Streets is a national 
initiative that encourages students lo 
make year-long commitments to com- 
munity service. 

Into Ihe Sireels is Ihe first major pro- 
ject of the Sludenl Outreach Service, 
Elaine Koenig, program director, said 
Ihe program's purpose is very clear; 
"The idea is to get Iho students excited 
about volunteering and find out how 
fun it is, then get a portion ol them to 
sign up on a regular basis," 

Koenig said, 35 IPFW students 
signeo up lo volunteer in the communi- 
ty. The projects included working al the 
Boys and Girls Club, working In St, 



Andrew's Soup Kitchen, and helping 
students al the public library. 

More Ihan 60 national and state orga- 
nizations are involved in the project. 
IPFW's Involvement began last spnng. 
According to Koenig, several campus 
organizations started the ball rolling by 
deciding that there was a need lor an 
organization that had volunteering as a 
central goat, 

'We didn'i realize thai il would be as 
needed as il Is," Koenig said. 
■Through Into the Streets the commu- 
nity knows that we are a service lor 
them, and that will lead to mote pro- 
jects." Koenig fell that the Student Out- 
reach Service is serving an important 
purpose. "It works lor the community 
and students. Il is definitely luffllling to 
volunteer and the community definitely 
needs it."

New counselor available to students 



Heather Washington 
Stalf Writer 

The phone rings, echoing its urgent 
call for attention. 

"Let ma get that. We have a suicidal 
student on campus," Ihe counselor said 
apologizing. 

"Hello- This is Becky," 

So began another day for Becky 
Brewster, IPFW's new personal coun- 
selor, of balancing herself on the 
leeter-totter of despair and hope. 

"It's unpredictable," said Brewster ol 
Ihe students' crises she faces daily. 
Brewster said It's difficult to maintain a 
regular schedule when one week her 
clienls may be calm, and the following 
week they may all be experiencing 
varialions of stress. 

Brewster became IPFW's first perma- 
nent counselor Oct. i and is available 
by appointment 24 hours a week on 
campus. Expecting her first month to 
be slow, Brewster's booked-solid 
appointment book has taken her by 
surprise. "You give up some of your 
persona! lime," explained Brewster of 



her sometimes hectic schedule. 

Brewster's counseling extends 
beyond the campus. She has a private 
practice based at Community Counsel- 
ing Center on West Jefferson Street 
where she offers personal guidance 
and advises other agencies. Occasion- 
ally she volunteers to give workshops. 

■This is a nice blend for me with my 
private practice," Brewster staled. '1 
see myself bejng able tojJtilize my lime 
better. 

Before taking the position at IPFW. 
Brewster was the clinical director of 
outpatient services at Parak Cenier for 
to years. She also worked for one year 
at Charier Beacon Hospital. 

She was doing less and less direct 
work in the menial health center "when 
working for Park Cenier. Brewster said. 
"Since this is a position lo be devel- 
oped, 1 can be more creative.' 

With over 400 posl-graduale hours in 
counseling and a master's degree in 
education, Brewster is familiar with 
many personal problems. She uses her 
cerlilicalion as an addiction and alco- 



holism counselor to help guide others 
through relaled problems. On campus 
she also deals with depression, 
divorce, and stress cases. 

"1 have always been fascinated with 
psychology and peoples' behaviors," 
said Brewster. For this reason, she 
chose counseling as a career. Howev- 
er, she believes others may see her 
techniques as dHferent from most col- 
lege counselors'. "I think my style is a 
little different," said Brewster. '1 think 
you can force people into positions to 
get help." 

Brewster offered a hypothetical situa- 
tion Involving a sludenl addicted to 
alcohol or drugs. II the student's par- 
ents have been protecting their child by 
paying for the student's DUl fines, Ihe 
parents should stop. She suggested 
that this method, combined wilh similar 
tactics, should teach both Ihe parents 
and the student to search for counsel- 
ing. Brewster felt that if a student is not 
hurting themselves or other people,

Seminar provides safety tips 



By KelllE. Beery 
Copy Editor 

What room in the house is a person 
most vulnerable in? What should a 
person scream when being assault- 
ed? What are three things a person 
should do when being raped by a 
known assailant? How often does 
rape occur in the United States? 
What are the chances of a woman 
being assaulted? 

The answers to these and other 
questions were given in the Be Safe 
Seminar last Wednesday in Class- 
room Medical Room 159. Wayne 
Groat, Midwest director of Be Safe 
Personal Crime Safety Seminars, 
gives these lectures all over Indiana 
and three other states. The Be Safe 
Seminars are funded by corporate 
suppon and private donations. 

Groat is a therapeutic counselor and 
a personal, marital and family coun- 
selor. He was recently specializing In 
rape, incest and abuse counseling. "I 
heard it all," stated Groat. "I'm 
shocked." His personal reason for 
being involved Is Ihal his daughter 
was raped and he promised her to 
help prevent the same Ihing Itom 
happening lo another women. 

Groat emphasized the point that no 
one is exempt from assaults "The 
criminal picks the time, picks Ihe 
place, and picks the person We don't 
have a lot to say about that, do we? 
The only element that we do control is 
his opportunity," said Groat. 

Groat started his lecture focusing on 
the home. He told the audience to 
have good deadlocks on all Ihe doors 
and auxiliary locks on every window. 
"We want to lorce this person lo 
break glass and splinter wood.' said 
Groat. "The longer it takes to get in 
(and). ..the more noise he makes 
doing it, the greater his risk." 

He also lold the audience to put 



stickers on every door and window 
stating that the house has an alarm 
system. That will stop the criminal by 
creating a mental delerrent. 

In a person's house there are lour or 
five places that a person is most vul- 
nerable In, the bathroom being one of 
them. Concealing a weapon there 
would be a good idea, said Groat, 
though he did say that ,357 Magnums 
aren't the only weapons Ihat wili pro- 
tect and suggested hiding cans ol 
tear gas. 

Groat then focused on the car and 
ways to be alert there. 'Criminals 
know that when we leave any build- 
ing, we can be distracted. From here 
to where you park, where you work lo 
where you park, v^here you shop lo 
where you park is called Ihe 'zone of 
opportunity,' Il lakes a criminal five to 
six seconds to decide who his victim 
is going to be. We send victim mes- 
sages. If we didn't, there wouldn't be 
so many victims,' said Groat. 

Some pointers that Groat gave al 
Ihe lecture included already having 
car keys in hand instead of rummag- 
ing through a purse, looking under 
your car when you approach, looking 
in your car. and locking your doors 
immediately when you get inside — 
even before starting the car or putting 
on the seat belt. 

Groat discussed bumper rape and 
bumper robbery, when a criminal 
causes an accident and, under Ihe 
guise of getting information, proceeds 
to rape or rob the victim. He slated 
that when people get in an accident 
they immediately get out ol the car; 
this is exactly where criminals want 
Iheir victims. Groat said to crack the 
window one half inch and exchange 
relevant intormatlon through Ihal one- 
hall inch in the window. Similarly, if a 
cop stops someone on a dark road 
and Ihe person Is suspicious of Ihe 



circumstances, the person can turn 
on Ihe dome light in the car lo let the 
police know that the person is aware 
ol them and then slowly drive to the 
nearest lighled area. 

Groat staled that property crimes 
can easily turn into violent crimes, A 
man can approach someone from 
behind and unless the person can 
see both ol the criminal's hands, the 
person should simply ask him what 
he wants and give it lo him. The crimi- 
nal could be carrying a gun or knUa In 
the other hand. 

The final focus of Ihe lecture was on 
rape. Groat stales Ihat a rape occurs 
every six seconds in the United 
Stales, and the Justice Departmenl 
stated that females have a one in 
three chance ol being assaulled. 

Groat said that 60 percent of Ihe vic- 
tims know their atlackers, "In that situ- 
ation, we recommend thai you make 
yourself as physically despicable aa 
you know how to do. That means the 
big three: vomit, defecate or urinate, 
preferably all three at the same time,* 
said Groat, 

Groat also relerred to creative 
actions women did when they were 
lold by unknown men Ihal they were 
going to bo raped. One woman laked 
a heart attack, 'She grabbed her 
chesi and fell on Ihe ground and 
moaned In pain. He leH her alone. ... 
Another one laked an epileptic 
seizure. Spit came out of Ihe corner 
of her mouth, 6yes rolled back in her 
head, she fell on Ihe ground and 
shook all around. She got away, ... 
Another one fell on the ground, start- 
ed eating grass and mooing like a 
cow. She got away," said Groat. 

His last point was "Don't give up 
your ability lo think," When a person 
gives up this ability, psychologically 
Ihal person is saying, 'I'll bo your vic- 
llm.'

Real learning requires 
more student effort 



The stale law in Indiana requires slu- 
dents to attend school until 16 years of 
age. This law's enfoicsment is intend- 
ed to benelil the community al laige to 
ensure that the working force has a 
certain minimal level of skills. This lev- 
el of skills should enable students to be 
sell-suflicient and thus relieving the 
public burden of supporting Ihem, 

Right now the educational system is 
lailing in iis attempt to reach, much 
less surpass, this essential sktli level. 
This is proved in Ian Rolland's, chief 
executive officer ot Lincoln Life, state- 
ment about the educalion in Fori 
Wayne, He said he was finding il hard- 
er to hire high school graduates from 
the Fori Wayne educalion system 
because the students didn't have the 
basic skills needed lor entry-level posi- 
tions. 

Tfie educational syslem, including 
parents, teachers, administrators and 
students, must raise that minimum lev- 
el of skills back to the level enabling 
students lo support themselves, 

Studenis, teachers and employers 
presently locus on grades and GPAs, 
Because ol this unneeded attention, 
studenis memorize jusi lo get good 
grades on tests, not to learn knowl- 
edge applicable lo the rest of their 
lives, 
^1 In high school about 99 percent of 
ithe lesls given required just a regurgi- 
"■lalion o( lacts. If a person could merfi- 
orize, a person could go through high 
school wilh straight A's, The odd thing 
about this is that once a person lakes 
the test, most of the memorized lacts 
and opinions of the leache; go out ol 
Ihe mind of the student never lo be 
remembered again. If the final exam 
were comprehensive, the studenis 
would have lo memorize everything all 
over again. That sounds like a true

learning experience, doesn't il? 

Students need to focus on learning 
and retaining knowledge, not memoriz- 
ing and forgetting. Students must 
comprehend, analyze and apply Ihe 
fads and theories to their lives. 

So what is a learning experience? 
In math it could be arriving at an equa- 
tion, not being given the equation and 
having to solve a page of problems 
ivhh H, In English it could be learning 
different philosophies and proving that 
an author's work manifests a certain 
one or a combination ot philosophies, 
not being told that Ihis work manifests 
this philosophy. In history il could be 
finding different theories tor ihe cause 
of a war through the writings and rela- 
tionships o) the time, not reading in a 
lexl Ihal these are the causes of the 
war. 

Educalion affects all of society when 
people apply il to their lives. II the 
United States wants to maintain its sta- 
tus as a world pov/er, the populace 
must be educated. Education doesn't 
mean the formal schooling process ol 
kindergarten through twelfth grade. 
Educalion is a iwo-paii process: grow- 
ing mdividually and contributing back to 
society. Students cannot do this 
through memorizing. Education needs 
to teach studenis how to learn, how to 
understand material and how to apply 
that maleriai to their lives. Only then 
can they learn and grow. 

This new level ol learning takes 
lime, patience and ellort both on the 
part of Ihe students and teachers. Stu- 
dents also need an aulhenlic desire to 
learn while teachers need to encour- 
age that desire in students. 

However, once the lormal schooling 
ends, learning, growing and contribut- 
ing must never end. II is through Ihis 
process Ihal America can grow.

As a community representative on Ihe

lo commend those students who have 
made an effort lo develop the volunteer 
spirit on our local c^pus. 

-It is gratjfying lo-sea- col lege students

Ex-cop says administration 
unfairly kept him from job 



To the Editor: 

This letter is in response and defense 
not only for mysell, Jerry Koeneman, 
but also chief Roby, first ol all. let's put 
all the facts into perspective. 

What I was accused ot was never 
proven in a court of (aw. Il was merely 
a city administrative hearing consisting 
ol three Board ol Works and Safety 
members. My being dismissed was 
based on a 2 lo 1 board decision with 
two men voting against me and one 
woman voting to retain me. 

Chiel Roby had made a decision to 
hire a person who had no other blem- 
ishes on his record, prior to Ihe allega- 
tions, during his tenure on the New 
Haven Police Department, who had 
been professionaly trained by the Indi- 
ana Law Enforcemenl Academy and 
had several inservice training certifi- 
cates. I was reccommended by the 
chief o( police in New Haven; and 1 
was given a high rating on interviews 
given by his sergeants. 

1 have been chosen by the New 
Haven Chamber of Commerce as Offi- 
cer of the Year in f984. 

I was investigated by the office of fed- 
eral investigations, Boyers, Pennsylva- 
nia, on a suitability and eligabilily for 
special-sensitive, ciitical-sensHive, and 
non-ciitical-sensitive positions lor their 
agency. A favorable determination 
was made for all positions. 

It was not fair, nor was is righl that 
IPFW assume that because someone 



is accused they intervine in the hiring 
process and the applicant is deemed 
guilty by allegalions. 

The decision to hire me was a deci- 
sion that Chiel Roby had lo make and 
it was, as in previous hiring circum- 
stances, his own. sole decision. 

I. as a former commanding officer for 
the New Haven Police Department, 
feel that Chief Roby made a fair and 
honest decision based on all the tacts. 

My only acquaintance with Chief 
Roby has been in Ihis last year of inter- 
views and I never knew him prior to 
that. 

If he is to be criticized for wanting to 
hire a qualrtied individual. Then are all 
department heads (o be criticized, it 
ever. I apply for some other job on 
campus? Of will I ever get hired? Just 
because they Ihink something might 
happen? 

It this kind of thinking is righl, should 
Judge Thomas be sitting on the 
Supreme Couri? Wasn't he accused? 
And what happened lo innocent until 
proven guilty? 

Chief Roby was going to give me a 
fail, objective, and honest benefit of 
the doubt; and that's more than I can 
say about his superiors. 

In closing I must say Thanks Chiel 
Roby and good luck in your endeavors.

something to clean up that environ- 
menl. It may be manifested by an ele- 
mentary ed major taking a few hours of 
valuable "free time: to volunteer a few 
hours at SCAN, the local child abuse 
organization. It may be a lew hours 
spent with a nursing home resident 
playing checkers or listening to stories 
of Ihe good old days." 

I have been a recipient of a volunteer 
effort offered through Ihe Hospice 
organization. My assigned volunteer 
was a hieline for me while my husband 
was dying I now am giving back to the 
community as a volunteer in many 
organizations because I realize how 
much that volunleer meant to me dur- 
ing adrlficult time 



The act ol giving from within (not from 
our pockets) is one of the most reward- 
ing acts one can every perform. I have 
a personal philosophy about volunteer- 
ing, I am molivaied by selfishness. In 
this context, selfishness is not a nega- 
tive word. I get back so much from Ihe 
lime I give. I believe I owe a debt to 
those less fortunate, and this is a way 
of giving back to my community. 

There are many organizations that 
need a few hours ol your time. I 
encourage you lo contact a studeni 
representative of the IPFW Into Ihe 
Streets organization. We need you 
and your community needs you. You

To the Editor: 

I would like lo oiler one coriection to 
Elizabeth J. Nesbitt's letter regarding 
the Women Writers' Support Group. 
There is an official group on campus 
who purpose is, in part, to support and 
encourage writers. Tlial group is Arts 
Group, a co-ed recognized studeni 
organization which promotes the arts 
al IPFW through publication of the jour- 
nal "Confluence!" 

Anwork and photography, as well as 
writing, are accepted lor publication. 
Any student may be a member ol Arts 
Group and any student, faculty or stall 
member, or alumnus may submit 
works to "Confluence." Anyone who 
would like more intormalion atioul Arts 
Group can contact me through Ihe 
depanment of English and linguistics, 



Classroom Medical Room 145. 

No single group can be all things to 
all people, and for Ihal reason groups 
such as the Women Writers' Support 
Group should be encouraged to form. 
People who join these groups know 
thai they already have one thing in 
common with one another In this case, 
being women writers and Ihis provides 
(or a comfortable atmosphere in which 
lo share and critique works. All subdi- 
visions of campus society, whether 
they are men writers, black writers, dis- 
abled writers, or whoever, should leel 
free to form groups in which they can 
discuss concerns and ideas unique to 
Iheir membership.

OCKAREETA SCRPfeBft 



Continued from page 1 

The Red Cross test is typical ol HIV 
testing procedures, said Helen Fiaziet. 
HIV counselor lor ihe American Red 
Cfoss. Phone ahead (or an appoint- 
ment lime; the piocess lakes roughly 
15 to 20 mjnules. The client is 
assigned to an HIV counselor, and is 
escorted to a prit/ate room, she said. 
The counselor then goes over Ihe test- 
ing pfocess and the procedure for han- 
dling Ihe client's test blood. The client 
signs a consent form showing that 
ho or she undersiands the test, said 
Frazier. 

Approximaiely 20 cubic cenlimeteis 
ol blood is drawn from the clieni's aim. 
Though Ihe client's name and number 
are initially allached lo ihe sample. Ihe 
name is removed in the testing room 
and kept in a conlidenlial life by the 
counsebr. The test lab (on the Red 
Cross premises) will only see a number 
for the two HIV-anlibody lests they run 
on the sample. Positive results are 
sent lo a lab in Maryland lor a third, 
confirming lesi, but they also only see 
■ a number. Test results usually lake 
two weeks, said Frazier. 

According to Indiana stale law, posi- 
tive results musi be reported to Ihe 
slate board ol health, but only statistics 
will be reporied, rot names. The state 
board of heallh volunteers its assis- 
tance in finding old lovers or needle- 
sharers for those v;ho lest positive. 

A second appointment is arranged 
with Ihe client lo let Ihem know Ihe 
results. It the clients' lest is positive, 
the counselor will give inlormation on 
the local AIDS Task Force, as well as 
the names of doctors who deal with 
AIDS victims. Also, Ihe counselor has 
to be prepared for the clieni's emotion- 
al reaction said Frazier. "We have lo 
let Ihem know, it's not a death sen- 
lencB." 
HIV counselors offer one on one help 

Frazier knows how lo talk to clients 
with both positive and negative results, 
she said. She's done HIV testing with 
the American Red Cross for two years. 
as well as having perfoimed hospice 
work wilh Ihe AIDS Task Force lor live 
years. She's seen clianiE come to her 
lor testing as young as 16 years old, 
and as old as mid-fiHies. but finds Ihe 
median age fails in Ihe late twenties. 

Clients come (or testing when their 
worry over high-risk behavior becomes 
dillicull to deal wilh, Frazier stated. 
"Often they're worried about Ihe one- 
nighl stands they've. had,' she said 
■'l-So'me are'l.V drug abusers, or have 
been in the past. Plus, fiomosexuals I 
see often. Some out ol the closet, 
some in, but they are all pretty con- 



scious about Ihe risk ol inleclion.' 

Sometimes culture, age and religion 
play a part in keeping some away from 
HIV testing, she said. Frazier has test- 
ed no African Americans at the Red 
Cross in her lime there, and said that 
Ihe number o( teenagers and Hispanics 
seeking lests has been disproportion- 
ately low. She blames pari o( ihe dis- 
interest on the fled Cross' northern 
locale. 'I wish we could lake the pro- 
gram lo Ihe people, set up a satellite 
oHice in ihe downtown and soulh-cen- 
Iral areas and reach (or A(rican$ and 
Hispanics Irom there," she said. 

Misconceptions about the risk ol HIV 
infection keep many heteiosexuals 
away Irom testing, she said. "The 
overwhelming opinion is that it's a- 
while, gay man's disease." she said. 
Frazier told a tale about one man, a 
helerosexual, who came lo her at the 
Red Cross afler visiting a local medical 
convenience clinic. 

"He was nervous and frightened 
about his chances." she said, "But the 
doctor stood there in Ihe oKice and 
talked him out ol Ihe lest. The doctor 
said. 'The chances ol a heterosexual 
gelling AIDS is belter ihan the chances 
ol you gelling hit by a bus.' There's 
more to it than thai, and the doctor 
knew it. But he sent ihe man out o( 
there with all his (ear still inside. Forlu- 
nately ha came to us." 

Hanging over the (actors o( race and 
religion is the issue o( homophobia, 
says Jack Ryan , head ol the AIDS 
Task Force. "We know there's been 
guys atraid to come in here. They're 
alraid ol being seen and people will 
think Ihey ate homosexual." 

AIDS Task Force eases 
HIV and AIDS problems 

The AIDS Task Force was created in 
1985. Ryan said thai two AIDS 
patients provided the impetus. Their ill- 
ness was a new problem for Ihe 
patient's (amilies and the local health 
care prolessionals. "Everyone began 
wilh a smattering ol knowledge, ,.. II 
was new, even lo Ihe physicians in 
town," said Ryan, who was present in 
those early days. "Everyone was 
expected to go (orih and bring back 
new in(ormation." 

Now the task (orce runs on a halt mil- 
lion-dollar budget, he said. "We used 
to have a hard time finding volunteers 
who would approach AIDS patients, 
but now they're coming to us in num- 
bers," he said. 

In addition lo addressing the practical 
needs ol persons wilh AIDS, the lask 
(orce provides counseling and orga- 
nizes group discussions for men and 
women who are HIV positive. "Sense 



ol humor, heallhy lives, and lots oltalk 
keeps their lives in balance," said 

Ryan tells Ihe story ol a man who 
learned he was HIV positive Irom his 
physician's receptionist after a routine 
checkup. This man, who is a friend of 
Ryan's, came to see him ai the lask 
force oflica afler hearing the news. 
"He lold me, '1 thought I should stop by 
to say goodbye belore I kill myself,'" 
Ryan recalled. "Folunately. he didn't. 
He was shocked and unprepared, and 
now he is living well wilh it." 

Patients vary widely in how Ihey five 
with HIV and AIDS, he said. Some 
react with denial at ihe outsel or spend 
their energy on anger, trying to figure 
out "Who did Ihis to me?" he said. 
Some give up on their life, neglecting 
their health and relationships. The 
ones who cope best talk about their 
AIDS wilh others, receive support in 
return, maintain a good diet, and guard 
against diseases that can erode their 
heallh, according lo Ryan. 

Ryan instructs a course on Ihe IPFW 
campus called 'AIDS: Issues and Chal- 
lenges" that meets every Thursday. 
He's dealt wilh students' atiiludes and 
questions (or three years. Ryan said 
the course deals with AIDS from many 
different angles: social issues, legal 
problems, family dynamics, homopho- 
bia, and what Ryan calls AIDS-o-pho- 
bia. 

Ryan is happy with the results Ihe 
course has had, but he recognizes that 
students in Ihe class signed up looking 
tor knowledge. Dispensing basic HIV 
and AIDS intormation to all IPFW stu- 
dents is mote problematic, he said. 
"We had an AIDS awareness week 
some years back.* said Ryan. There 
were fliers and signs everywhere but 
there was not much response or inter- 
est in the lectures, said Ryan, 

He went on to say, "We need to find 
what works effectively and address stu- 
dents in that way." 

Frazier said o( sexually active stu- 
dents, "There's this mind set among 
them (hal they can do what they want 
and they'll live torever." She tells Ihe 
students, "Be responsible for yourself. 
Don't be deceived by the Russian 
roulelle-odds game of sex. Pay atten- 
tion to the warnings.' 

Ryan concurred saying, "It's jusl lime 
that all ol us were honest about AIDS, 
our emotions, our sex life, everything.'

Brewster 



Conlinusd from page 1 

this forceful approach may nol be 

appropriate. 

Brewster said her counseling 
approach is related lo the alfective 
style, in which clients learn to gel in 
touch wilh themselves. A recent study 
by psychologist Irene Elkin found that 
interpersonal psychotherapy similar lo 
Brewster's approach helps moderately 
depressed subjects as much as cogni- 
tive behavior therapy and the antide- 
pressant drug imipramine. 

"Some students are dealing v/ith 
problems that lake more Ihan a few 
sessions," said Brewster. For Ihose 
cases, she refers the students lo coun- 
seling centers which can oiler more 
intense care. Because ol Ihe part-time 
schedule IPFW ollered Brewster, her 
therapy sessions are crlsis-orienled, 
meaning that they help people through 
immediate problems. 

Shorl-term therapy sessions are 
sometimes disputed by psychologists. 
William Piper, a University of Alberta 
psychologist, interviewed psychologists 
who practiced both short-term (25 ses- 
sions or less) and long-term (more than 
76 sessions) therapy. Some psycholo- 
gists fell short-term therapy is Ihe opti- 



mal selection when there is a choice 
because when patients know they will 
be in long-term iherapy. Ihey lake 
longer "lo get down to work." Other 
psychologists counter-argue that the 
quality ot therapy sutlers as a result ol 
minimizing sessions. 

'People (should) not be alraid o( the 
stigma of mania! health," advised 
Brewster when suggesting tips on who 
should seek counseling. Changes in 
behavior including excessive sleeping, 
crankiness and slopiness when these 
traits are not normally characteristic of 
a person may be clues of emotional 
stress. In these incidenis, Brawsler 
said, Ihe person needs to talk lo some- 
body belore it gets serious. 

An abundance ot support groups may 
be a sign of society's changing attitude 
toward personal counseling. Brewster 
suggested. "The community, in gener- 
al, has widened acceptance ol coun- 
seling." 

That acceptance shows ilsell in Ihe 
nation's colleges. The Department of 
Labor's 1990 occupational projection 
data predicted a moderate increase lor 
college counselors between now and 
Ihe year 2000. "As the role ol coun- 
selors is being gradually expanded 



beyond academic counseling into such 
areas as family relations and sub- 
stance abuse." During Ihe same time, a 
moderate decrease in college adminis- 
tralors is expected as a relleclion ot 
dropping enrollment rates. 

Brewster's position is one ol Ihe 
33,000 expected to be created by 
2000. Before this year, IPFW conlracl- 
ed area counselors to help students 
cope with their problems, 

Brewster said Ihere is a need for a 
full-time personal counselor at IPFW. 
However, financing troubles may make 
filing this need dillicull, she said. 
According to Brev/ster, Ihe education 
and human services depariments may 
be developing a personal counseling 
internship to work in cooperation wilh 
the part-time counselor until a full-time 
position is ollered.

versity ol Southern Indiana 1S-2, IS- 
IS. 7-15, 15-4 on Friday and relurned 
on Saturday to take Kentucky Wes- 
leyan College in three games 15&gt;d. 15-

ning streak lo lour malches. 

Two quick service aces by Jill Lyon 
started Ihe Lady Volleydon roll. IPFW 
Jumped oul to a 4-0 lead before USI 
called lime. The limeoul was unsuc- 
cessful as Lyon served lor another 
poini making ii 5-0. USI stopped the 
run with a sideoul before ihe Lady 
'Dons (allied. As Ihe team traded side- 
outs, IPFW accumulated points leading 
to Wendy VanderWilfs kill from a 



strong back row attack that put Ihe 
Lady 'Oons up 9-0. 

The Screaming Eagles picked up two 
points before senior Denise 
Scheumann served lor Ihe linal six 
points to wrap up Ihe game. 

The second game on Friday proved 
to be more ol a challenge lor IPFW. 
The Lady 'Dons were down 11-8 belote 
Lyon served lor six straight points to 
pul IPFW up 14-11. After the teams 
traded sideouts junior Temple Swover- 
land served lor the linal point. 

The third game was reversed. USI hit 
a strong point to pull out a 1 5-7 victory. 

The Lady 'Dons did not wasle any 
lime wrapping up their 20th victory of 
the season. The lourth and final game 
started as sophomore Joy Thayer was 
substituted into the serving position 
where she served lor an ace lo pul 
IPFW up 2-0. Swoverland served lor 



seven straight poinls with a strong Iront 
row from Thayer. Lyons strong kill 
wrapped up the 15-4 win 

VanderWilt led the Lady 'Don attack 
with a career high 22 kills. 

Saturday brought on another GLVC 
rival when Kentucky Wesleyan visried 
the Athletic Center. Although the 
Panthers enleied the match with 
the GLVC's leaders in kills, block 
solos, service aces and digs with 
Candice King, Jenny Boyd, and 
Denise Higdon, they had a 2-5 con- 
ference record. KWC left with 
another loss as IPFW won 15-4. 
15-1, 15-4. 

VanderWilt led the Lady 'Dons again 
with 11 kills and two service aces. 
Scheumann scooped up live defensive

blocks. 



Soccer team finishes fourth 



By Mark Donald5or&gt; 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW soccer team capped a 
turn-around season by finishing lourth 
in Ihe 1991 Great Lakes Valley Confer- 
ence tournament in Evansville last 
weekend. 

The Mastodons advanced to Ihe 
linals by beating Bellarmine College 3- 
2 In a shootoul last Wednesday. 
Sophomore Neil Bogenschuiz and 
freshman Brian Butz scored during 
regulation, both in the lirst hall. 
Bogenschuiz scored olf Kevin 
Green's cross, and Butz intercepted 
a pass to Bellarmine's keeper and 
converted lor his goal. 

After the teams tied In regulation, 
Buiz, Green, Bogenschutz, and Itesh- 
man Jason Lee scored in the shootout 
to seal the victory. 

On Saturday the "Dons dropped the 
semHinal match 2-0 to Lewis Univefsi- 
ly. Lewis had beaten IPFW 5-0 during 
Ihe regular season but was forced to 
lorleil the game lor using an ineligible 
player. 

Coach Troy Rushing commented on 
the game. 

'I wasm surprised that Lewis reached 
Ihe semifinals," he said. "But we 
played them better than we did early in 

RESURCHilfOIIMAIION 

L^ro«st Ubrary ol Intormatkiii In U 



the season. We had our opportunities 
to win the game." 

Returning to lace Northern Kentucky 
University in Ihe consolation game on 
Sunday Ihe 'Dons fell 3-0. 

"It was 24 degrees," said Rushing. "It 
sure wasn't soccer weather. In my 
opinion, NKU was the second best 
team in the league. They were bigger 
and stronger than any other.* 

On Tuesday Rushing was named 
GLVC Coach of Ihe Year lot engineer- 
ing Ihe f^astodon turn around Irom last 
years' 1-15-2 linish. The 'Dons lin- 
ishedlhis season with a record 7-1 1-1. 

Rushing attributed Ihe improvemenl 
to cohesion among a large freshman 



class. 

"We had a good recruiting year," said 
Rushing. "The Ireshmen really came 
together. Many ol the players con- 
tributed and will be back. I expect at 
least 16 players who were on the final 
roster who will be back next year." 

Three IPFW players also qualified 
for the All-GLVC team. Senior 
sweeper Brendan McCormick 
joined Bogenschuiz, who was the 
liflh-leading scorer in the confer- 

nee. Junior Matt Parker 



named to the All-GLVC tearr 
the second siraighl season.
