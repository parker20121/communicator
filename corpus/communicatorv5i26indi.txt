last spring with a student ■ 
chaired by Alvin Rockhill and Sandy 
Jones to prompt the building of 4 
courts for varsity, intramural and 
general university use. 

A general lack of funds has boon 
the roadblock to the building of the 
courts. When they could not get 
money from either the athletic 
committee or directly from the 
Students' Government, they decided 
to raise funds from donations. 

However, Bolyard said, "We 
were asked to hold off until we 
received university commitment. The 
niversity was morally behind i

four-court complex with a hard 
surftu-iiiR called green laycolde. Costs 
of surfacing and equipping the courts 
will run between $20,000 and $30,000 
according to estimates made last 
spring. 

Bolyard commented, "The longer 
we wait for something like this, the 
more it will cost us." He explained 
that the costs of surfacing are 
appreciating rapidly. 

"1 think tennis courts are a very 
important asset to any college 
campus, particularly when we have 
very few recreational facilities."

we don't even have a home court to 
compete on. In fact, we have to split 
our tournament up because we play 
six singles and we use courts that 
have only two playing courts." 

Roland Clements, a member of 
the athletic committee which budgets 
all sports activities, commented that 



only has a yearly 
budget of about $50,000, and that the 
$30,000 requested for tennis courts 
was probably too much for the 
athletic committee to handle. He 
added, "As long as they don't let the 
people go to the outside to get 
donations, they won't get anything 
done. We just don't have that kind of 
money." 

Brock Able, student body presi- 
dent, said that in order for the athletic

"At this time," Able said, "They 
are funding a trip to Jekyll Island for 
about forty varsity athletes. The 
student body as a whole does not 
benefit from this." 

He also added that he is in favor 
of having tennis courts built on 
campus because, "Anything that has 
to do with recreation on campus 
should be our number one priority." 



Bayh: prevention is answer 



By MARK FRANKS 

The key to the juvenile delin- 
quency problem in this country is 
prevention, Senator Birch Bayh told a 
gathering of social workers and 
concerned citizens last night. Bayh 
was invited to discuss two bills 
dealing with delinquent children that 
he has introduced in Congress. 

Bayh, who is chairman of the 
Senate sub-committee on juvenile 
delinquency, said that the two bills 
are presently in the House of 
Representatives, where he thought 
their chances of passing are good. 

"We are trying to de-emphasize 
institutionalization," said the Sena- 
tor. He said that attention needed to 
be individualized for more effective 
results. 

"The kids got into trouble one at a 
time; we have to keep them out of 
trouble one at a time," Bayh said. 

Bayh's bill calls for the separa- 
tion of adult offenders from the 
juveniles, and encourages the separa- 
tion of first time offenders from the 
repeater. 

The Senator said that when the 
young first time offenders are jailed 
with the hard core criminals, instead 
of the bad learning from the good, the 
good usually learn from the bad. 

Bayh said that the youthful 
joy-rider quite often learns how to sell 
the car without getting caught the 

The bill would deny federal funds 
to any locality or state that did not 
separate juveniles from adults in 
their penal institutions. 

Bayh called for more counseling 
in the grade schools for students that 
may be potential law-breakers. He 
criticized the present counseling 
system which is oriented almost 
exclusively toward getting the high 
school student into college. 

The juvenile delinquency bill 
would provide federal funds to hire 
counselors for grade school students. 



Responding to a question about 
parents of delinquents, Bayh said that 
counseling of parents is also neces- 
sary. He cited a city where there is an 
organization that brings parents and 
children together to discuss home 



directly to these boards. It provides 
for 50 per cent .of the money to go 
directly to local jurisdictions, and 25 
per cent each to state and federal 



taught how to drive a tractor and milk 
a cow. He said that the children 
should be trained in skills more 
meaningful to their big city environ- 



Ken Watson, chief juvenile proba- 
tion officer for Allen County, agreed 
that the parents were important in 
dealing with juvenile delinquency. 
Watson said that professionals have 
taken away much of the responsibility 
for child raising from the parents, and 
that it should be returned to the 
parents. 

Bayh said that his bill stresses 
community input into the treating of 
the problem of delinquency. The bill 
would create broad-based community 
boards to be composed of alt agencies 
public and private that are concerned 
with the problem. 

"We hope to mesh together those 
public and private agencies that deal 
with this problem," said the Senator. 
He hopes to add to this a "significant 
infusion of federal funds." 

The bill, which would authorize 
the expenditure of one billion dollars 
over four years, would provide funds

c format, the Communi- 
cator learned early this week. The 
change is anticipated for mid-March. 

The change in format allegedly 
was abrupt, and caught most people 
off guard. Many of the WLYV disc 
jockeys will resign, according to 
reliable sources in the radio industry. 
This includes "super-jock" Phil 
Gardner. 

WLYV will change its call letters 
to go along with its new coiuitry-poli- 
tan format. The station hopes to 
convey a "country cousin" image, 
according to one source. 

Country-politan stands for Nash- 
ville music with a Top 40 delivery, 
according to Professor P. Dale Ware. 
The format includes up-beat jingles 
and Top 40 style disc jockeys. 

"The name (country-politan) im- 
plies country music for city people," 
said Ware, adding that the format 
originated when it was discovered 
that all country music fans do not live 



out in the country.

program director for radio station

questions concerning Volunteer In

member. The club maintains an office

Volunteer In Court has adopted 
the slogan, "A community solving a

the program is to provide a one-to-one

volunteer and the young offender. 

The program attempts to provide 
concerned citizens a meaningful input 
into the community problem of crime, 
especially those committed by juven-

Slipping down the slope 



Once again Hoosier weather is out of season. Mid-February, which 
should be cold and dreary, has acted more like spring the past few days. 
Evervone is happy to see warm days in winter. Almost everyone, that is. 

The cold weather buffs are the miserable lot who find themselves 
parking in the B Lot north of the Student Union. Cold weather, you see, 
freezes the ground and quite often covers it with snow. And where there is 
:snow covered and frozen ground, there is no mud. 

Those of us who abandon our vehicles in (his forgotten lot and then 
attempt to negotiate the Great Mud Slope must face up to reality; we 
cannot hope to forestall spring forever. But of course our odds of holding 
off spring seem better than our chances of getting a sidewalk. 



remember the comments that the 
"hardhats" used to make. I remem- 
ber the attitudes of the truckers. I 
remember these things being done, 
and said, and felt against us because 
we were pointing out something 
serious going wrong with our country. 

My Psychology professor was 
angered by my comment that a whole 
country could get sick; he felt it 
couldn't be ailing so long as our 
hunger and poverty was not as 
widespread as it was in his home 
country. India. 

I read about truckers shooting 
each other and I wished that I could 
give them a vision of the spirit of love 
and unity that sustained us as we 
marched in Washington, D.C., in 
Michigan, in Indiana, and in other 
places. 1 remember us sitting in a 
close circle singing songs and 
drinking wine after a long day's 
march outside of D.C. We sang, we 
laughed, we got up and started single 
filing down the road, trucking was fun 
in those days. A couple snuck off into 
some bushes and made love in the 
radiance of twinkling stars and to the 
rhythm of the trucking farmworkers. 
Nobody shot anybody. Nobody beat 
anybody up.... Nobody did those things 
to each other, anyway. 

We did have the fear of the 
outsiders. In DC. we were buzzed by 
truckers, and we had threats of 
snipers. In Michigan, one of our 
attorneys was severely beaten, and 
my Honda almost went head-on with 
an on-coming car. Guns were pointed 
at us many times We were joyful, but 
we were not playing games Truckers 
aren't playing games either. But, 
they're not joyful. 

I wish I could help them. But I 
can't. What can 1 say? 1 told you so? 
That wouldn't be love. And love is 
what they need. Oh, my brother

say this to you: "Love your enemy, he

FOOTNOTES: A CONGRESSIONAL REPORT 

Budget to be pared 



President Nixon has sent to 

Congress the first $300 billion budget 
in the history of the country. In fact, it 
calls for the expenditures of $304.4 
billion during fiscal year 1975. The 
budget has within it a planned deficit 
and anticipates an increase in the 
1 debt for this fiscal year of 



$16.3 billion and for next y 
increase of $19.8 billion" The 
push the total national debt to : 
of $495.2 billion. The figure 
enough to boggle the mind, 



But that is not the whole story. 
Obscured in the President's budget, 
which is cast solely in terms of 
outlays, are the real figures the 
President is asking us on the House 
Appropriations Committee to pass on. 
The language of the budget can be 
confusing. What the President's 
figures express are outlays -- only the 
money which will actually leave the 
Treasury during fiscal 1975 and flow 
into the economy - but in reality 
Congress is being asked to vote into 
law spending authority for fiscal 1975 
of $33.1 



ment can legally commit itself to 
spend for fiscal 1975 programs, even 
though a lesser amount - the outlays - 
actually flow from the Treasury 
during the year. 

The President in submitting his 
budget uses the "unified budget" 
concept. Because this takes into 
account all receipts, including the 
surpluses in the trust fund accounts 
(such as Social Security and the 
will Highway Trust Fund), it makes it 
level appear as though our deficit is less 
; are than it really is. (By the way, this 
iren't procedure was started by President 
Johnson.) The deficit under the 
federal funds concept, with the 
surpluses in our trust funds washed 
out, is really projected to be $17.9 
billion and not the $9.4 billion under 
the unified budget concept. The total 
authority request for foreign aid is not 
the $4.1 listed in the outlay column, 
but is rather $4.7 billion. And the 
actual authority request for national 
defense is not fully represented in the 
proposed fiscal 1975 outlay figure of 
$87.7 billion. In terms of budget 
authority, it rises to $95 billion during 
fiscal 1975, and from there to a 
projected authority figure of $101 
billion in fiscal year 1976. We can't 
help but ask when we see those 



figures, "Why does peace t 



Committee, on which I sit, will cut 
this budget. It has every year for the 
last thirty years. I suspect the knife 
will be exceptionally sharp this year, 
but we will also be cautious and 
attentive as we trim. I say this 
because every indication is that the 
economic picture for this year is not a 
rosey one. The President's Council of 
Economic Advisors has projected the 
national growth rate for the coming 
year at only one per cent. Our own 
Joint Economic Committee in Con- 
gress anticipates that it will be only 
two-tenths of one per cent. We must 
not pare our expenditures so as to 
exacerbate this recessionary trend, 



uate forever these immense deficits. 
Given the hazardous course ahead - 
with both inflation and recession 
stalking the country - the traditional 
role of the Appropriations Committee 
in reducing budgets along sane and 
responsible lines must be exercised 
with even more diligence now than in 
the past. 

Maybe you have some ideas. I 
will be glad to r

Not surprisingly, beer consump- 
tion rose more rapidly than alcoholic 
beverages generally - by 10. 1 per cent 
in dollar sales, and 4.8 per cent in 
barrel shipments. 

For beer, 1970 represented the 
second largest consumption percent- 
—2-72 



in the recession year of 
1970, alcohol consumption generally 
was going up 5.4 per cent in dollars. 



( which factor out inflation) , beer rose 
almost 5 per cent while alcohol 
generally rose less than 2 per cent. 

And, again not surprisingly, a 
recession brings out the moonshiners. 
According to Licensed Beverage 
Industries, moonshine spirits rose to 
26 million gallons during 1970, versus 
only 9.2 million in the fairly robust 
year of 1972. (Stricter enforcement 
was also a factor in the large dropoff. ) 

Also, during 1970, states which 
were among the hardest hit economi- 
cally - California, Florida, Michigan 
and Washington - experienced gallon- 
age increases relatively larger than 
those of the less-impacted states. 

And, during the recession year, 



; which increased a 
Nevada, Minnesota, Illinois, Dela- 
ware, New Jersey, Connecticut, 
Rhode Island and the District of 
Columbia - while sales picked up in 
every one of the 18 states contiguous 
to them.

'■LAUGHING AND I 

Cliff Milnor always believed thai there was only one 

thing better than column readers, and that was readers who 
. From Denise Yaney comes the following: 



class on the second floor of Neff Hall. It s 
used to having classes on the third floor of Neff, that he 
naturally walks down one flight of stairs to his office on the 
second floor. 

"Since persuasion class has been meeting in Room 278 
Neff, Dr. Wilkes has repeatedly gone down one flight of 



laughing and disbelieving all the way.' 



due to some 'international bankers' 
j and it didn't even slow her pace. 

She has a talent for every finger on both her hands, and 
somehow through the days that make the years she has 
managed to utilize them all. The fingers that could coax 
Chopin, could also type, and twist a rich pie crust. She could 
and did parlay a charisma and true touch for the dramatic 
into political and national offices. Her ire becomes intense 
when discussing some political figures or that island 
kingdom located somewhat off the coast of Ireland. Yet her 
eyes fill with tears at a TV showing of skinned baby seals. 
She is always traveling, crusading, or planning something 
unique. This year she may do her own income tax for a first. 

All generations can her something special-siblings, 
children, grandchildren, and the great grands. Recently 
two grandchildren indignantly refused a bird shaped music 
box for her collection when the clerk insisted, ' 'All old ladies 
like this one." That just didn't sound like their lovely lady. 
And they were right. HAPPY BIRTHDAY IRISH! 

AT THE POST AGAIN 

Lest anyone believe that The Washington Post only 
picks on presidents in office, let the record be read. Last 
spring when that eminent environmentalist, Senator 
Edmund Muskie of Maine was leading the Democratic 
contenders for the nomination of his party, the Post 
dutifully listed Senator Muskie along with other notables 
arrested for illegally using bait to lure birds while hunting 
on Chesapeake Bay. 

BILL BORED 

Wasn't it O'Henry who wrote a sentimental tale about 
the "Last Leaf"? All revolved about the falling, or 
non-falling of the last leaf clinging resolutely outside a 
dying girl's window. Somehow the billboards of IU-PU 
campus are reminiscent of that last leaf. True, our posting 
areas are always producing new little sprouts. But how 
tenaciously some of the old leaves cling. 

You are continually reminded to participate in the late 
lamented MS Marathon. Then there is Hamlet showing 
February 1. Or do you think you could spare enough gas to 
attend that special lecture on the other side of town at the 
Unitarian House on December 12 (19731? Little Turtle 
Aboite Women's Club Inc. invites you to their store, and 
wants to assure you that there are special Christmas 
shopping hours Wednesday and Thursday during 
December. This offering bears no date so you may read it 
retroactive 1973, or phophetic 1974. And all those texts 
offered for sale, were they sold, or did they go out of print? 

Other than the search for the oldest, most obsolete 
offering attached to a thumb tack, there is another 
intersting side search for bill board readers-student 
graffiti penciled on the postings. But that's another column 
altogether! 

FOUR CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF— 

Or four students in search of a teacher, found Dr. 
Stephen Clinton sitting in his office last Thursday afternoon 
".bout ten of one. S. 210 assembled as usual at 12 : 30 p.m. The 
second year Spanish comp class waited and waited. Finally 
a posse of four elected itself to find tl 



bewildered Dr. Ginton. Due to a Monday absence, the 
good doctor had realigned his days, and Thursday was 
Wednesday and there was no comp class at 12:30, This tittle 
time shift wrecked what had been a perfect eight years 
record of no time lost for the doctor Not such a buenas

Daniel Kelesakis says that if a friend back home in 
Greece writes enquiring how the girl students dress here 
(mini or maxi skirts) he is going to have to answer, "I am 
very sorry, friend, but I have forgotten that girls wear 
dresses. The only thing I can see here is pants." 

In S. 235 Dr. Linda Fox was lecturing: "The second 
theme is love, and youthful illusion." 
"Same thing!" snapped Pat Brown.

BIG TEN BASKETBALL 

The Purdue Boilermakers choked in 
the clutch on triple overtime Monday night 
and dropped into a tie for third place in the 
Big Ten race by losing 112-111. It was quite 
embarrassing when you consider the 
opposition was the Iowa Hawkeyes— then 
1-6 in the converence and losers of eight 
straight.

THE NBA 

Turning to pro basketball, everything 
is relatively the same except for one 
interesting note. That is the play of the 
Detroit Pistons. 

In the NBA Atlantic Division, it's the 
Knicks and the Celtics on their way to yet 
another playoff spot. In the Central sector 
the Bullets and Hawks lead the way. 
Atlanta has lost seven more games than 
they won and will still make the 
playoffs— what a shame. 

The Golden State Warriors and the Los 
Angeles Lakers are trading the lead back 
and forth. Seattle, Phoenix and Portland 
are already looking toward next year. 

In the Midwest division, it's the Bucks, 
er Jabbar. up by three games over the 
Bulls. The Bulls, in turn, are one in front of 
the surprising Detroit Pistons. Detroit, as a 
matter of fact, has the fourth best record in 
the league. 

When the NBA championship series 
comes around, it will probably be the 
Celtics or Knicks against the Bucks or 
Lakers. So what else is new?
