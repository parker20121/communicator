Harbor Arbor Days plans set 



History 
reviewed 

By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

An annual tradition, Harbor Arbor 
Days, is coming soon. 

Conceived in the mid-sixties, the 
first Harbor Arbor Days celebration 
was about 1967, said John Ulmer, dean 
of student services. 

"At that time the river was utilized 
quile a bit and there was a custom of 
planting trees every spring," Ulmer 
said. 

Don Finney, Indiana University 
relations officer, conceived the 
name Harbor Arbor, Between 1967 
and 1977, the event developed into a 
popular celebration, al times drawing 
people from Ohio, Ulmer said. 

Among the events were canoe races, 
a tricycle race imitating the Little 500, 
an outdoor pig race and a concert at 
the Walb ampitheater. "One year 
12,000 attended the concert," said 
Ulmer. 

"The thing that killed us was 
(moving) it back to April (when the 
school calendar changed)," Ulmer 
said. When the semester ended in 
June, it was possible to count on good 
weather in May, Ulmer said. 

"This year, we have scheduled 
bigger events (than last year) which 
we hope will draw more people," said 
SUBQG chair Lisa Sewell. 

"We've tried to get as many ac- 
tivities as possible and Involve as 
many organizations in the planning 
process as possible," said Elizabeth 
Schlueter. Harbor Arbor Days chair. 
The College Bowl idea came from 



history club, Schlueter said. 

Wednesday, April 16, the featured 
activity will be a free concert by the 
Henry Lee Summer Band. "Summer 
and his band are rooted in rhythm and 
blues and the motown sound," said 
Lisa Buckles, SUBOG concert chair. 

Summer plays mostly original songs 
"to gel people to come hear Henry Lee 



Summer do Henry Lee Summer ... not 
someone else's already charted 
tunes," said Buckles. 

Supporting Summer are Rick 
Beneick, guitar; Mark Rohrman, 
bass: and Mimi Mapes, vocals. Benick 
has toured with Roadmaster and Mitch 
Ryder. Rohrman has played with Ihe 
Faith Band and Duke Tomato. Mapes 



was one of the Vahondez Sisters with 
Dr. Bop and the Headliners prior to 
coming to the Summer Band Mapes 
recently sang background on John 
Cougar Mellencamp's new album, 
"Minutes," said Buckles. 

There will also be impromptu 
contests at Ihe Walb ampithealer 
during the week on Monday, Wed- 
nesday and Friday, said Schlueter,

University reviewing advertising agreement 



By JOHNETTE TOPL1SEK 
Editor-in -Chief 

The subsidy The Communicator receives from thechancellor'sofficeinthe form 
of guaranteed advertising may be cut out of the university budget within the next 
three years. 

According lo John Carnaghi, vice-chancellor of financial affairs, the reviewing 
of their budget and of The Communicator funding is just good business practice. 

"It's a way of evaluating if funds are being used the best way they can be," said 
Carnaghi "This is not an attempt to cut back support of The Communicator." 

Although the funding from the chancellor's office is only six percent of The 
Communicator's budget, the cut could still hurt The Communicator, since the 
newspaper has been financially strained over the past several years, said Michael 
DeFreeuw, publisher of The Communicator. 

Judith Clinton, executive director of community relations, said the publications 
board (made up of administrators, faculty and students) has been asked to offer 
suggestions as to how The Communicator can be taken off the subsidy. 

Members of the present publications board have denied any knowledge of the 
request. 

Clinton said there is no intention of taking away the money suddenly, but over a 
period of time instead. 



According to a report presented to the acting chancellor by Clinton. "Only at 
IPFW does the chancellor's office provide an additional subsidy in the form of 
guaranteed advertising and paid subscriptions lor faculty and staff." 

However, according to officials at two Purdue branch campuses, their papers 
also receive a direct subsidy through their chancellors' offices, similar to the set- 
up at IPFW. 

At the present time. The Communicator charges the university a discounted 
advertising rate of one dollar per inch. According to Carnaghi, if the subsidy is 
cut, The Communiealor could raise ils advertising rates. 

The problem with increasing university rates is most campus organizations will 
not be able to afford the new rates that would increase by two to three times the 
current rate, nor could they channel any of their advertising through the chan- 
cellor's account. 

Organizations will be responsible for their own ad expenditures. 

"This could be a better financial deal for The Communiealor." said Carnaghi. 

DeFreeuw said The Communicator definitely plans to raise both its university 
and its local advertising rales for the next academic year, bul the rates will not 
increase as drastically as they would if a similar arrangement with the chan- 
cellor's office is retained. 

The final decision will be made in July, when the budget is approved. 



Professor Nault completes a labor of love 



By M1CHELE R. SHAFFER 

Managing Editor 

In 1850, "The Scarlet Letter," 
written by Nalhaniel Hawthorne, was 
published. The same year, Ike Mar- 
vel's "Reveries of a Bachelor; or, A 
Book of the Heart," entered the annals 
of American literature. 

In "Annals of American Literature 
1602-1983," edited, in part, by Clifford 
Nault, associate professor of English 
at IPFW, such obscure relations 
between great American authors, 
little-known poets, society and history 
are covered. Nault worked together 
with Richard Ludwig, professor of 
English at Princeton University, to 
complete the volume. 

Nault began his labor of love 18 
years ago, in 1962. He didn't count on 
the project taking so long, however. "I 
figured it would take five or six years. 
As it happened, I was way off on my 
calculations." said Nault recently, 
according to a recenl article in The 
News Sentinel. 

As it turned out, Ludwig had been 
requested by the Harvard University 
Press to work on a similar project. He 
called Nault and offered to collaborate 
on the effort . Thai was seven and one- 
hall years ago Today their completed 
efforts are bound in a single volume, 
published by the Oxford University 
Press (OUP), 

The book is designed as a reference 
work (or American literature scholars, 
and also is a "treasure trove of in- 
formation for the general reader," 
according to a review by the Oxford 
University Press. It begins in the year 
1602, with a description of the 
published account of early American 



exploration by John Brierton. The 
volume concludes with the 1983 
publication of William Least Heat 
Moon's "Blue Highways," a chronicle 
of the author's travels on American 

In between, the book has other facts 
that tell the reader what an author had 
to contend with at the lime his works 
were published. For example, when 
Herman Melville penned his now 
classical "Moby Dick" and was trying 
to get his other works published, Susan 
Bogart Warner, virtually an unknown 
author to many, published her much 
applauded novel, "The Wide, Wide 
World." 

"The book gives a year-by-year 
account on what's what in American 
Tetters," said Nault. It's entries are 
organized chronologically by 
publication date and include the 
author's name, dale of birth, the 
work's complete title and a 
classification by genre. The work also 
includes side-columns which list 
historical events occurring at the same 
time an author's work was published. 
For example, in Nault's "Annals," one 
can find that in 1789, the year James 
Fenimore Cooper was bom, bourbon 
whiskey was first produced in Bour- 
bon, Va. 

Nault hopes his completed work will 
serve scholars much in the same 
manner "The Annals of English 
Literature" also published by the 
Oxford University Press, has done for 
years. He explained he began the work 
because the Oxford English Edition 
did not contain many American 
authors. 

Nault said it was not difficult to 



complete the work with another man 
living half-way across the country. "It 
was easy because he had access to all 
Ihe library facilities that I didn't," said 
Nault. Ludwig works in the Special 
Colled ions and Rare Books section of 



the Princeton University Library. 

Nault requested over spring break 
that the IPFW library carry the book. 
and the Helmke library already has 
the book on order now, according to 
Nault. 



Densel wins car race 



By LILLIAN LYON 
Copy Editor 

Recently, Goeglein's Reserve on 
MaysvilleRoadin Fort Wayne was the 
site of a miniature kit car race. The 
Fort Wayne section of the Society of 
Automotive Engineers sponsored the 
annual "Great Aero Alarm Clock 
Race," held this year on March 12. 

"This is a race of vehicles designed 
and built by students from four 
engineering and technical schools in 
this area; the Indiana Institute of 
Technology, Tri-State University, 
Northwest Technical College of Ohio, 
and Indiana University- Purdue 
University at Fort Wayne," said 
Professor Donald J. McAleece of the 
manufacturing technology department 
at IPFW. the faculty adviser of SAE 
student branch al IPFW. 

Each student who entered the 
contest bought a kit consisting of a one- 
twelfth scale model of a Corvette, 
produced by Gay Toys of Walled Lake, 
Michigan, and they also purchased a 
Big Ben alarm clock The vehicle may 
be modified aerodynamically to im- 
prove the air flow around the car. but 
the clock spring powering the car 
cannot be altered in any way. 

The cars race two at a time on a 
track that ends in a wind tunnel 



providing a severe wind load on each 
car. "This is the reason for the 
aerodynamic design modifications," 
added McAllece. 

IPFW SAE student members have 
participated in this competition for 
three years and have accumulated 
several wins. In both 1984 and 1985, 
Roger Leeper won the 5600 first prize. 
In 1986. this year, David Densel won 
first place, again a $600 prize. Mark 
Moore won the $300 second prize and 
Michele Goulet won the $100 third prize 
this year. Goulel is the first female 
engineering or technology student to 
have entered the contest. "She per- 
formed very well this year and gained 
experience which will make her an 
outstanding competitor in future 
races," McAleece commented. 

The Fort Wayne SAE section also 
supported a contest for the par- 
ticipants to describe in a written paper 
their design considerations when 
making their race vehicle The winner 
of the paper contest will be awarded a 
$100 prize, making the total prize 
cofler $1100, a lota! awarded each 

"This is a worthwhile support of 
student activities by a professional 
engineering society." concluded 
McAleece.

I hursd i . April 10, 1986 



Purdue students protest 
their generic diplomas 



Current Purdue diplomas do not state 
the curriculum from which you 
graduate. Instead, the diploma states 
"the requirements of that degree." 

After years of studying, writing term 
papers and taking exams, who wants a 
diploma simply stating "that degree"? 

Before 1972, Purdue diplomas did 
declare the curriculum, but apparently 
for the convenience in the printing and 
distributing of diplomas, the Purdue 
Board of Trustees decided to make the 
diplomas generic! 

Brad Klein, a construction technology 
student and a member of the graduating 
class council, has initiated a petition 
drive in the hopes of having the diplomas 
changed. 

After the petition is completed, it will 
be presented to the chancellor and then 



given directly to the trustees. 

Hopefully with the signatures of many 
concerned students, the trustees will 
take the matter into consideration and 
realize after years of hard work to 
obtain a degree, no one wants a generic 
diploma. 

Graduates need diplomas that state 
their curriculum— their expertise. 

If you are a Purdue studnet who 
doesn't want a generic diploma, take a 
moment to sign the petition and show 
your concern for the cause. 

Petitions are available at the Sweet 
Shoppe, located in the Walb Memorial 
Union, or the Alumni office, located in 
Kettler Hall, room 112. 

Although the petition may not help this 
year's graduating class, it may be 
beneficial to future classes. 



Help us to help you 



University support. Student 
involvement. 

These are two major aspects of a 
successful college organization. Without 
these, the majority of the many 
organizations and activity groups which 
represent IPFW probably would cease to 
exist. 

Fortunately, for IPFW, the 
administration recognizes this, and the 
result is obvious: several award-winning 
organizations on campus. 

Take for example the IPFW Forensics 
League, directed by Vicki Karns, 
assistant professor of communication. 
Karns has consistently led her students 
to victory in speech meets across the 
Midwest. Karns always credits faculty 
dedication, the Students' Government, 
and the involvement of the students. 

Another less recognized award- 
winning organization is the IPFW 
branch of the Society of Automotive 
Engineers. For the past three years an 
IPFW student has won the $600 first 
prize in the contest for the best 
aerodynamic design of a miniature car. 

A third example of a successful 
organization is the newspaper you have 
in your hand. The Communicator staff 
recently attended the 29th Annual 
Indiana Collegiate Press Association 



Convention. The paper won several first, 
second and third place awards in the 
categories of continuous news coverage 
of a single news event, for the coverage 
of the Purdue University takeover; 
editorial campaigns, for editorials on the 
fine arts building funding and the 
Purdue University takeover; best 
editorial cartoon for the cartoon 
featuring "yes men" on the Search and 
Screen Committee; best comic cartoon, 
for the Heartland strip; best copy in 
advertisements; best art in 
advertisements; best review for "Fool 
for Love"; and last but not least, best 
overall newspaper design. 

Up to this point, The Communicator 
has received the encouragement, 
support and cooperation of IPFW 
students, faculty, and administration. 
The result is a student newspaper 
recognized and respected by other 
Indiana college newspapers. 

In exchange for the support given to 
them, these organizations are helping to 
provide a positive image of IPFW in the 
eyes of the community and other 
campuses. By showing their support, 
administrators should be aware they are 
not only helping the organizations 
involved, but they are ' helping 
themselves as well.

Letters to the Editor 



Professor, class 
reviews needed 

To the Editor: 

For the last couple ol 
semesters, I've been having 
a lot of bad experiences with 
my classes. It seems like 
some of my professors lack 
teaching skills, experience 
and personal involvement 
with iheir classes. Feeling 
frustrated and enraged by 
this situation, I decided to 
make a more informed 
selection of my classes this 
semester to prevent a 
recurrence of this problem. I 
soon round out how difficult 
this task would be. 

When I registered (or 
classes this semester, I 
asked my friends, advisers, 
and section department 
heads about prospective 
classes and professors 



compared to others in the 
same section and course. 
Only a few of them could 



thei 



selve; 



to 



anything more than an 
unimaginative response, 
about as informative as the 
sound of a dropped shoe as it 
hits the floor. Thud! 

It would be great if you 
could look up a class and 
professor to get a brief 
biography, their experience 
and track record based on 
past student evaluations. A 
rating system of classes and 
professors should be 
compiled like "Consumer 
Reports" but only in a class- 
professor directory type of 
form. This direcUy then 
could be kept in the library 
for use in selecting classes 
and professors right for our 
needs. 

Working together by 



calling or writing the 
Students' Government and 
the university chancellor, we 
can eliminate the frustration 
of making uninformed 
education purchases. Wecan 
make IPFW responsive to 
our needs by standing up for 
our consumer rights and 
demanding to know in ad- 
vance what we can expect 
from our education pur- 
chases. 

Ray L. Raynor 
IPFW student 

Open doors 
to community 

To the Editor: 

In support of the article 
written by David Leedom 
.Mi ml in the March 6 issue of 
The Communicator, a few 
comments. Last year, a play 
was done during Black 



History Month called 
"Ceremonies in Dark Old 
Men," directed by Robert 
Bresnick. The lead role 
called for a 54-year-old black 
man who could sing and 
dance in addition to acting. 
Students fitting that 
description were seemingly 
unavailable. A member of 
the cast asked me to read for 
the part. I did, andwas given 
an opportunity I shall always 
cherish. 



It is history that the play 
was a hit, that we had sold 
out each night: standing 
ovations. The point is: if only 
students were involved I 
would never have had the 
chance to become involved 
with the theater as an actor 
and receive the emotional 
and educational experiences 
resulting from it.

Spring is in the air - it's time to go barefoot 



spkAjls du^-a $&lt;**/ 



By M. KATHLEEN GREVEN 
Features Editor 

Lock your books in the closel for a tew hours this weekend 
jj and run barefoot in the park this weekend. 

Pay no attention to the predictions of snow showers and 
E dismal weather being reported on the radio — at PIT this 
$ weekend, the weather will be just fine! 

Neil Simon's comedy, Barefoot In the Park is "right 
Ifor this time of year," said Joel K. Murray, director 
| "Barefoot has the spirit of spring — that happy-go-lucky 
Equality." 



PIT's production isn't Murray's first encounter with this 
play. He played Paul Bratter, the male leading role seven 
years ago, and confesses that it's one of his favorite roles. 
Portraying Paul at PIT is newcomer Freddie Basnight, 
opposite PIT veteran Donette Blanks as his newlywed wife, 
Corrie. 

The Bratters portray their life together while making a 
home out of a liny, walk-up apartment on the top floor of a 
New York brownstone. Forging a marriage is universally 
known to bean ambitious undertaking even under the best of 



conditions. This couple not only triumph over the elements 
(scorching heat in the summer and no heat left over for the 
top floor of the building in the winterl and the neighbors (an 
eccentric roof-dweller, to name one .. ). copes with the 
idiosyncrasies of repair men and in-laws and prove onceand 
for all that true love prevails — providing you have a good 
sense of humor. -i 

The play opens Friday night and runs weekends through 
April 26. All performances are at 8 p.m. Tickets are $5 for 
general admission, S4 for senior citizens and S3 for students.

of us a lot." 

Game three of the match 
went to Wisconsin as they 
battled back from an 8-3 
deficit early in the game. 
Game three saw the score

loo powerful for the 
Wisconsin team, which.

well and our blocking was 
better than it has been,"
