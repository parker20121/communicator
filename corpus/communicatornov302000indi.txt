Former Lincoln 
Life CEO 
participates 
in Professor 
for a Day 
program 



By Gloria de FarIa 
Chief Reporter 



On Monday, Nov. 8, forrr 
Chief Execulive Officer ol Lincoln National • 
Corporation Ian M. Holland visiled IPFW as pan of 
the "Professor for a Day progrum," Organiied by 
IPFW External Relations, the program, which 
began In March, is an attempt lo improve Ihe rela- 
tionship between students, business faculty and 
business execulives and to ctcale awareness about 
the IPFW School of Business. 

According to Zoher E. Shipchandler, associate 
dean for Exlemal Relations, the program has three 
mam goals. "The first goal of Ihe Professor for a 
Day program is lo expose our sludenls lo senior 
business executives in order for Ihem lo leain from 
the problems and challenges Ihal senior executives 
have experienced. The second goat is lo increase Ihe 
level of inleraction between the School of Business 
faculty and Ihe senior business eieculivcs and the 
third reason is lo give die community leaders an 
appreciation for Ihe mission, goals and operation of 
the School o( Business," Shipchandlcr said. 

Around noon, Rolland was introduced lo the 
School of Business faculty, graduaie NfBA sludenls 
and the President of the Accounung Society. He was 
dien presented widi the "Honorary Teacher for a 
Day" award by the Vice Chancellor for Acodcmic 
Affairs, Susan Hannah. "Mr Rolland Is a remark- 
able corporate citizen who has backed up causes 
such as desegiegalion and quality education with 
pereisicncc," Shipchandlcr said. 

Rolland then proceeded by briefly talking 
about his life prior lo and after his position as CEO 
ai Lincoln National Coiporation, as well OS Ihe chal- 
lenges of which he often faced Rolland also lalkcd 
about what he called ihc four constituents of an 
organization which include Ihe community, 
accountants and employees. He also discussed the 
pace of change and corporate responsibility 

According to Edwin Leonard, professor of 
business administration, Rolbnd's commitment to 
having a vision to make Ihe community a better 
place came before he became CEO of Lincoln. "He 
and his wife. Mimi, in the sixties, when it was not 
the thing lo do. swam upstream, went against the 
cunenls of die sticam by becoming instrumeatal 
and providing enthusiasm and encouiigemcnl for 
people to get off their hands and become involved 
with Ihc communily." Leonard said. 

Scheduled to teach a markeling class at 2 p.m. 
and also a class of graduate students later in the 
alfemoon, Rolland covered marketing issues, ethi- 
cal issues, corporate responsibilily and ifae chal- 
lenges of running a major corporation. 

IPSGA members 
to discuss options 
for making results 
of teacher 

evaluations available 
to students 



Malland, 

Jan Wade and Jeff Sterling, senaie pro lempore will 
work overwinter break on specifics t&gt;f a bill passed 
dunng Ihe summer to crealc a system for students 
to access teacher evaluations. The system, accepted 
in principle by IPSGA. must be malched wtih a 
detailed plan for enacting ihe idea. 

The bill, which was authored by Sterling and 
signed by Student Body President Nick Gray, 
charges the IPSGA Legislative Affairs Commiltee 
with ^e duly of working with administration and 
faculty Senate 'to create i mutually acceptable pro- 
gram and implement (il).* Sterling said sludenl rep- 
lesentalives, however, are nol reslncted to faculty 
opinions about the system. The bill emjxiwers us 
to do diis on our own,' Sterling said.

Weekend misadventures 



Though I still con-

weeks ago, I"ve learned lhat somclimes the 
backlash and the hindsight of an event can be 
more upsetting than what actually happened. It 
can also, at the same lime, make you feel 
extremely good about how things worked out 
in die process. 

My girlfriend and I were both eiiremely 
stressed out and decided a couple of weeks 
ago to take a break from things. We were on 
our way back from a day trip to Indianapolis 
and a handful of other places when the radio 
slarled flashing on and off. After uttering t few 
choice profanilies, I quickly ascertained 
through my past e«periences thai my allema- 
lor was dead and Ihil I had only a short lime 
left until the battery itself would die. We 
pulled off at the nearest eiii. the Deercreek 
Music Center eiii for Nobles ville, and prayed 
we had enough juicc left in the battery lo gel 
us close to town. We managed lo travel only 
one of the Tive miles towards Noblesville 
before we were forced to coast off the road. 

After emptying ihe car of everything we 
needed to make it lo town, we started Ihe long 
tiek towards civilization, which ended up not 
being as long as we'd planned. Within sight of

day, diough. I suppose I thought it was all a 
dream. We"d goilen lost on the way lo down- 
town Indianapolis, we'd gotten losl in down- 
town Indianapolis and we'd gotten losl while 
leaving downlown Indianapolis. Troth be told, 
had we not spent so much lime trying to get 
where we wanted lo be. Ihc car probably 
would have made it back the 90 or so miles 
from Indianapolis without incidenL Now there 
wasn't a car al all. The whole thing seemed 

When we did gel lo Ihe scene of the acci- 
dent, Ihey were handcuffing Ihe guy who had 
demolished my car. Al riist. I was glad lhat he 
was uninjured. However, as I slared at Ihe guy. 
a wave of pity overwhelmed my body That

me. If Ihey weren't so harmless, I was bigger 
than both of them and I was confident I could 
easily defend myself against ihem. 

After turning down their thoughtful offer 
lo let us stay with Ihem for die night, we 
checked ourselves into a hotel room and, 
despite it being midnight, began making 
phone calls. Perhaps the most imporunt phone 
call 1 made lhat night was to the police to let 
them know my car was on the side of the road 
and I was having it lowed so they wouldn't 
worry aboul it. This was very important as half 
an hour after I called them, diey knocked on 
our hotel room and lold me my car was 
totaled.

been laughing. After all I'd been ihiough If 



ml was under order 
custody until the other guy was taken away for 
fear of an altercation, bul all 1 could think of 
was how tcmbic lhat guy musi feel. 

After a little bit of woik. we managed to 
gel a ride home Ihe neil day from my girl, 
friend's parents. [ honestly don't know what 
we would have done wiihoul ihem, as only 
one of my friends offered to drive lu home and 
he had lo work most of the day. 

Once we Tinally did make it home. I was 
jusl glad to be safe, t called all my close rela- 

called my sister Ihe night of the accident and 
upset her as my sister only heard my car was 
totaled by a drunk driver, leaving my sister lo 
assume 1 was in the cor when it occumaJ. 

As the accident occurred only minutes 
after my girlfriend and I hitched the ride lo 
Noblesville. I've been Icfl wondering ever 
since what would have happened had we 
stayed with the car. The Idea thai we could 
have been there is not too fat-feiched. Had I 
not been the only person in my family without 
a cell phone, I probably would have used my 
cell phone to call a tow Uuck ond would have 
waited with the car. Having seen my car, I con 
tell you I wouldn't have lived 10 leom any- 
thing from the situation had 1 been there when 
Ihc wreck occurred. I'm surpnsed ihc odier 
guy was slill sunding. 



At any rate, my girlfriend and I were 
both extremely lucky that night, despite all of 
our bad luck. We were lucky to be stuck in our 
options in walking towards town, wc wxrc 
lucky to get picked up by such a wonderful 
couple and wc were lucky to be able to get a 
hoi el room until someone could pick us up. 
Despite the loss of my primary mode of irans- 
porlation and Ihc countless hours of sleep I've

problems arcn'l always as'bad as what we

Depression can be 
devastating enough lo cause a person to 
lose inlerest in hobbies and favorite 
aclivilies. Those with depression will 
oflen have (eclingi of wonhlessncss and 
may even think about harming them- 
selves. Furthcmorc. depression may also 
lead ID Dppelile disturbances, poor sleep 
patterns and general loss of inlctesl in 
sexual relalionships. 

So, what do you do if you or some- 
one you know is depressed? One thing 
that is helpful and is highly recommend- 
ed is lo develop a good support system of 
family and close friends. Many times. 
Just having someone close and support- 
ive IS enough to help someone dcaJ with 



ending of a relationship. 

Though having a healdiy suppoil 
system is important for cfTeclive coping, 
diere are times when professional inler- 
venlion is wairanled. Piofessional inler- 
vcntion is essential when there is a risk 
of suicide or the person affected is no 
longer able to attend lo daily losks or is 
unable to function at work. 

The first step is to tecogniic the 
problem and to assist them in gelling 
professional counseling. Often a call lo 
the family physician can be a good first 
step. IF the physician is unable lo be of

policies cover a percentage of Ihe cost of 
treatment. 

Once Ihe individual has been 
assessed, there are several different 
cations for licalmem, depending on the 
severity of Ihc depressive symptoms or 
Ihc danger of suicide. 

Typically, if (he individual is 
assessed and vcrbaliies thoughts of 



harming himself, the individual will 
more than likely be admitted to an inpa&lt; 
lieni unit in order to be safely monitored. 
The psychiatrist will assess the patient 
widiin 24 hours and will then make rec- 
ommendations for treatmenl and medica- 

Al the inpatient unit, a trained ther- 
apist will assess the individual in order to 
set up a therapy regimen best suited for 
Ihe individual's needs. Effective individ- 
ual therapy typically involves encourag- 
ing die person lo identify and eiamine

As Purdue's football team prepares for 
their first trip to the Rose Bowl in 34 years. 
Head Coach Joe Tiller made n stop in Fort 
Wayne on Tuesday. Nov. 21, to speak about 
this season's success and post-seaion hopes. 
Purcue plays Washingum in the Rose Bowl 
at Pasadena, Calif,, on Jan. 1. 2001. 

This year's Rose Bowl appeararwe will 
be Purdue's fourth straight bowl game and 
will be the second year in a row that Purdue 
will play on New Year's Day. Ttller beheves 
the eipericncc will only be beneficial. "I 
think the fact ihat we've been involved in 
posi-scason play three consecutive years is a 
advantage. Your players are used 



Drew Orecs. senior quarterback and 
Heisman Trophy hopeful, will be leading die 
Boilcrniokcr's attack. Brees has thrown for 
oi-er 3,100 yards on 266 of 444 attempts, for 
23 touchdowns. Tiller stated. 'Eiperience in 
situations like this really has a way of mani- 
fesiing itself in a positive way." Brees has 
quarter backed for the Boilermakers for the 
past four seasons and has led the team lo a 
bowl appearance in each of diose years. 



Tiller believes the eipenence of play- 
ing in bowl games die past three years is a 
tremendous advantage for the Boilermakers. 
He believes lhat since his players are used to 
practicing late into December, they will be 
very prepared for what is ahead. Speaking on 
the preparations for ihe Rose Bowl, 
Tiller said. 'We did change our 
routine lost year from the previous 
two years. We did more dirowing 

a-day practices... when we practice, j 
we're gonna be out of school, so 
we have dicse guys all day long " 

One struggle that Tiller had to 
deal with is the community ciuic- 
ment over die Boilermaker's bid i 
for die Rose Bowl. Purdue was 
alone in Tint place of the Big Ten 
after beating Ohio State and 
Michigan. "For two weeks prior to 
us playing Michigan State, all anybody wjni- 
ed to talk about was Ihe Rose Bowl, msiead 
of playing Michigan State," Tiller said. The 
community celebration was "ahead of its 
time-lhe giddiness, giggling. These guys 
were die darting of dicir eyes, slapping on 
their bocks and dicyjusi replayed, relived Ihe 
Ohio State game 100 times." 

Going to the Rose Bowl, Tiller lays, 



Oui 




huge implications diroughout ci 
university, throughout o 
:ommunily it just going bonkers, lalfciiig 
iboul Ihe greater Lafayette area and probably 

"You would like lo think 
lhat we don't have to stand there and 
preach about what we have to offer. 
Radier people will recognize lhal 
there is substance lo ii because 
we've been able to be successful 
over a limited period of time," said ' 
Tiller. 
For Tiller's Boilermakers, il is an 



cipecl lo win. Tiller said. "Now Ihey 
eipcci lo win against everybody. 
Now 1 think they believe Ihey 
belong anywhere." 



.Luoking forward lo die "granddaddy of 
ihcm all," Ihe Rose Bowl. Tiller is eicilcd 
and expecting great things from his players. 
He trows Purdue can hold their own againsi 
anyone, as Ihey have in the past. It is now in 
die hands of the coaches to prepare their 
teams lo participalc in the greatest boivl 
game inoneofthe greatest bowl stadiums.

Head Coach Kellcy Hartley said. 
"We did the best we could under 

eumstances may well have left 
IPFW wondering what they had 
to play for, seeing as how they 
would not be eligible for post

Il may well have led lo a 
concession with players dirow-

been lermed a pointless season. 
May have But did not. Il wis out 
ofour control. Hartley said. "We 
were wonted about things we 
could control." 

Things like digging, 
killing, and blocking - you know, 
playing volleyball for the sake of 
volleyball. Hartley repeatedly 
cited the dogged determination 
and resilience of her players, 
players who took die conditions 
they were given and produced a 
regular season performance 
which was literally unlike any 
other in the OLVC "If rhad lo

Hartley said.
