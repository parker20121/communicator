Appropriately, Richard 
associate professor of communication, 
presented a resolution requesting the 
search for chancellor be a national 
search. The faculty senate approved 
the resolution. 

Hess explained the resolution is 
aimed at specifying the search for a 
chancellor be a national search, 

"I'm not so sure this is a settled 
matter ... This would be an appropriate 
time to discuss this," said Hess. 

In other business Monday, Michael 
Downs, chairman ol the department of 



political science, presented a resolution 
at the faculty senate meeting Monday 
asking the University Resources Policy 
Committee lo keep in mind several 
ideas concerning the construction of a 
fine arts facility location of the fine arts 
building (keeping in mind a preference 
for it to be built on campus), the fun- 
ding of the building and the insufficient 
funding provided by the General 
Assembly, and the precedent set for 
partial funding. 

The University Resources Policy 
Committee is in the process of 



preparing several resolutions ■ 
cerning the fine arts facility. 

Presently, the actual site of con- 
struction for the facility is being 
discussed. 

In July, Beering indicated he would 
make a major effort lo obtain the $225 
million needed to build the fine arts 
building at the IPFW campus. "There 
will be a major effort to reapproach the 
legislature next year on Ihe project," 
Beering said. 

However, Nicholson has said building 
a facility is a remaining alternative. He 



lid an option is to raise the money 
through a fine arts drive and build near 
the underpass at Main Street and the 
Columbia Street Bridge. 

Nicholson said a fine arts building in 
that location would be four minutes 
closer to campus than the present 
location on Berry Street. 

Nicholson also said he thought there 
is a need for additional fine arts 
facilities downtown. "1 don't think 
there are adequate facilities for the 
performing arts downtown,'* he said. 
"You could make a persuasive case for 
a theatre that would seat 1S0O."

IPFW professors raise 'star wars' issues 



By EARL SMITH 

Chief Reporter 

Two IPFW professors presented the 

issues raised by the emergence of "star 
wars" technology at the Chamber of 
Commerce Third Thursday Forum this 
morning. 

Julius Smulkstys, dean of Arts and 
Letters, presented the pros, and Van 
Coufoudakis, professor of political 
science, presented the cons of the issue. 

Their discussion may be seen on 
cable channel B today at E p.m., 
Saturday at 5:30 p.m. and Sunday, Oct. 
20 at 2 p.m. 

The issue of star was research, or the 
Strategic Defense Initiative (SD1), has 



caused much debate at IPFW. 
When contacted Monday, Dean 
Smulkstys referred all questions to 
Coufoudakis. Dipak Chowdhury, chair 
of earth and space sciences at IPFW, 
said he was unaware of anyone on 
campus who was strongly in favor of 
the concept. "Basically I'm opposed to 
the whole concept," said Chowdhury. 

Many faculty members at the parent 
campuses, however, have taken 
positions. Future issues will carry 
interviews with them. 

David Koltick, professor of physics at 
Purdue University, West Lafayette, 
speaks for a group of physicists who 



research. Reached by phone on 
Monday, Koltick said research into SDI 
technology is quite important. 

Star Wars technology is the only way 
to make nuclear weapons obsolete, 
said Koltick. "1 think it is crazy to nol 
invest in any means of nuclear 
delerent." 

Koltick feels the cost of making 
nuclear weapons obsolete is worth any 

Coufoudakis, on the other hand, feels 
the cost of developing such a system 
would not be cost effective. Fur- 
thermore, implementation would have 
a negative effect on arms control 



ago tia lions. 

Koltick assumes there would be 
continued weapons reduction "II we 
dropped the amount of megatons by a 
factor of 10 and SDI was effective by a 
factor of 10, then the world would be too 
limes safer," said Koltick. 

The U.S. is increasingly dependent on 
satellite communications and star wars 
technology is Ihe best way lo protect 
our satellites, said Koltick. 

Coufoudakis feels the use of star wars 
technology would be a violation of in- 
ternational law. There is an in- 
ternational treaty banning military 
uses of space, Coufoudakis said. 




Students interview 



By DEBORAH ST ARKS 
Chief Reporter 
"The IPFW Alumni Associations,

Director of Alumni al IPFW. 

"This luncheon offers juniors and 
seniors the opportunity lo meet with an

Replace confusion with 
the fine art of action 



No one can deny the urgent need for 
new Fine Arts facilities at IPFW. The 
current facilities, located downtown on 
Berry Street, are highly inadequate. Nor 
can anyone fault the Fine Arts 
department's faculty. They've seen the 
promises for new facilities go unfulfilled 
year after year as well. 

However, the recent resolution passed 
by the student senate indicates those two 
bodies feel the whole FAF-IPFW 
marriage to build a new Fine Arts 
building downtown is an ill-conceived 
notion at best. We couldn't agree more. 

Let's forget, for the moment; the 
practical problems that will arise from a 
downtown Fine Arts building controlled 
jointly IPFW and the FAF. What 
concerns us more than these practical 
problems are the precedents that are 
being set by this whole affair. 

First, we are sending the wrong 
message to the state legislature. In 
effect we are telling them that any of our 
financial needs should only be met 
halfway, and we will find the rest of the 
funding somehow, no matter what 
compromises we must make along the 
way. 

Secondly, in effect, we are telling the 
community the IPFW campus is 
somehow segregated from them and 
that it is not a vital part of the 
community, We are reinforcing their 
belief that a fine arts building on campus 
would not benefit the com muni ty-at- 
large. What's next? A joint venture 
between IPFW and the Chamber of 
Commerce for a business school 
downtown? We are also telling ourselves 
that we are second-class citizens here in 
Fort Wayne. 

Thirdly, we are sending the wrong 
message to West Lafayette. Not only are 
we telling them that they can be less 
than energetic when lobbying for us with 
the state legislature, but we are really 
telling them that we don't trust them 
either 



In the aftermath of all the excitement 
over the new management agreement, 
we seem to have forgotten President 
Beering's remarks concerning the Fine 
Arts building. In the July 18 News- 
Sentinel, he is quoted as saying, "There 
will be a major effort to reapproach the 
legislature next session on the project." 
We must not forget that Purdue has 
taken a lot of flak recently over the new 
management agreement and they are 
therefore somewhat under the gun on 
this issue. This is an opportunity for 
them to display their good intentions 
concerning the stewardship of 1U 
programs at the Fort Wayne campus. 
Efforts to deny them that chance can 
only be read as a slap in their face and 
can only worsen relations between the 
two campuses. 

What is particularly baffling in this 
regard are the statements and actions of 
Acting Chancellor Nicholson. Has he 
really thought this one through? He 
argues a new downtown Fine Arts 
building will be four minutes closer to 
campus than the present location. That's 
like saying you're moving from Fort 
Wayne to Van Wert so you can be closer 
to New York. His statement that there 
are not "adequate facilities for the 
performing arts downtown" must come 
as a surprise to people at the Embassy, 
the Performing Arts Center, the Scottish 
Rite Auditorium, the First Presbyterian 
Theatre, the Museum of Art, and the 
Grand Wayne Center. 

However, at this point, we need more 
than resolutions. We need resolve. 
Representatives from the Fine Arts 
department, (he faculty-at-large, the 
student body, and the chancellors office 
need to sit down immediately with state 
legislatures and representatives from 
Purdue and paint a strategy that will 
insure funding for an on-campus Fine 
Arts building during the next legislative 



Don't risk a life for 
'just one more drink' 



The Indiana Code states it is "unlawful 
for a person to sell, barter, deliver or 
give away an alcoholic beverage to 
another person who is in a state of 
intoxication if the person knows that the 
other person is intoxicated." This code 
includes hosts of social gatherings. 

When a person is under the influence 
of alcohol and cannot make reasonable 
decisions for himself, then someone 
needs to do it for him. This is particul- 
arly important in deciding whether or 
not to drive. 

In this case, being under the influence 
is not only hazardous to the driver, but to 
all others on the road. 

Is a drink worth your life or someone 
else's? In many cases the person driving 
under the influence is not the one who is 
seriously injured or killed, it is the 
innocent person who is punished. 

; killing or injuring someone 



while under the influence, consider the 
guilt you would live with because you 
had "just one more" drink. Is death or a 
life of endless guilt worth that extra 
drink? 

A common attitude among drinkers is 
"It won't happen to me." This is a poor 
attitude, and a very sad excuse. It can 
happen to you I 

Last week, I watched someone close to 
me experience the trauma of taking 
someone's life in an accident. He was 
driving while under the influence of 
alcohol. 

The mental torment he is experiencing 
is a very uncomfortable sight. On top of 
everything else, he now faces a homicide 
charge and a possible prison term of 
several years. 

If you must drink, think twice. Put 
away your pride. Let someone else do 
the driving.

Letters to the Editor 



To the Editor: 

Asa freshman at IPFW, I 
am confused about college 
life. The professors ap- 
paret'/Jy do not adhere to the 
requirements they clearly 
set: "Perfect attendance 
required." 

I was 20 minutes early for 
class so I sat in the lobby and 
looked over today's lesson 
once more. At ten till eleven 
I sauntered down the long 
dark hallway, mobbed with 



people. I saw a classmate 
walking in the opposite 
direction. Had they moved 
the class to another room? 
Was I going to be late? 1 
hurried toward the room. 
Rushing through the door, I 
found the room was full of 
empty chairs. Was I in the 
right room or on the right 
Door? I turned and found a 
note saying, "Mr. Gideon's 
EET 102 will not meet 
today " 



Two days later I arrived 
five minutes early for Mrs. 
Hamilton's Math 150 class. 
The entire class was there-, 
we were ready to begin. 
After five minutes everyone 
started looking around to see 
what the problem was. Ten 
minutes later a classmate 
stated she was going back to 
work and stomped out the 
door. Now the classroom was 
filled with noise as we were 
debating what we should do. 



Twenty minutes after (he 
class was supposed to have 
started, a lady finally 
walked in to announce Mrs. 
Hamilton would not be here, 
In high school if a teacher 
is absent, a substitute is 
provided to continue the 
classwork as the teacher has 
instructed. In college when a 
professor is absent, the 
student loses a day's in- 
struction, along with gas, 
traveling time, and money. I 



know the student pays (or 
every hour spent in class. 
Therefore, could a substitute 
be found when the professor 
is going to be absent? Could 
the student be notified i 
advance that the class will 
not meet? Why could he not 
receive a refund for the 
hours he is forced to mis: 
Should not the student 
receive some considerate

Rod Germann

New liquor tax in effect: 

First increase on spirits since 1951 



The first lax increase on 
distilled spirits since the Act 
of Oct. 20, 1951, which in- 
creased the tax on distilled 
spirits from 19 to $10.50 per 
proof gallon, took effect in 
the United Stales on Oct. 1, 
19SS. 

"There had not been an 
increase on Ihe tax of 
distilled spirits in M years," 
said John Marco, inspector 
for the Department of the 
Treasury Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. 
"This tax increase (Public 
Law 98-369) is part of the 



Federal Government's 

Deficit Reduction Act, which 
was enacted on July 18, 
1984," said Marco, 

As a transition to the new 
tax rate, this act imposes a 
one-time floor stocks tax 
equal to Che difference 
between the old and new tax 
rotes of N per proof gallon 
on all tax paid distilled 
spirits held for sale on Oct 1, 
1985. 

This tax increases the rate 
of tax on distilled spirits 
from S10.50 to (12.50 per 



proof gallon. 

According lo a pamphlet 
issued by the Department of 
the Treasury, a proof gallon 
is defined as, "A standard 
U.S. gallon of 100 proof, or its 
alcoholic equivalent " For 
example, one gallon of 200 
proof spirits would equal two 
proof gallons, 10 gallons of 80 
proof spirits would equal 8 
proof gallons. 

Package stores with 500 
gallons or less on hand will 
be exempted from the floor 
stock tax. Wine and beer are 
not included, even though 



they must Hie a lax return. 

Some package stores in 
Fort Wayne noticed a dif- 
ference. "Sales in our four 
stores for September was up, 
but sales were off for the 
first two weeks in October," 
said Andrew Lebamoff, 
manager of Cap N' Cork. 

"There was a decrease in 
the sales of alcohol in the 10 
Belmont stores," said Doug 
Richey. manager at the 
Norlhcrest store. "It was 
hard lo tell if the decrease 
was due to the tax increase 
or Ihe lime of year," said

"The week before the tax 
increase was like our 
Christmas sales. In fact, 
some of our customers did 
their Christmas shopping in 
anticipation of the tax in- 
crease," said Richey. 

Since Ihis was a one time 
tax increase, most stores 
contacted felt sales would 
increase as soon as 



customers had time lo adjust 
to the increase. 

"Even though Ihe in- 
ventory was done on Oct. 1,

Bars hedge ban 
on Happy Hour 




"Some establishments use 
other ways to get around the 
Happy Hour Ban in In- 
diana," said William Coyle, 
executive secretary of the 
Alcohol Beverage Com- 
for the state of In- 



"Some establishments use 
the "Happy Days" 
promotion, which is a special 
drink price for a whole day. 
instead of the illegal two 
drinks for the price of one," 
said Coyle. 

"Some bars may sell beer. 
for SO cents all day to get 
around the happy hour ban," 
said Coyle. 

The Indiana General 
Assembly enacted a law in 
1985 which made it illegal lo 
sell alcoholic beverages, two 
for the price of one, during a 
certain time of the day. This 
law took effect on Sept. 1. 
1985 



"The Legislature felt the 
happy hour promotion led to 
the forced consumption of 
alcohol," said Coyle. 

The Alcohol Beverage 
Commission is the 
regulating agency for 
alcoholic beverages in In-

Library here to serve 



By GARY LACY 
Staff Writer 

The Helmke Library at 
IPFW is a popular place for 
students to gather and study. 
Its various materials can 
provide the student with 
information needed to finish 
a research paper or for 
general purposes. 

Upon entering the Helmke 
Library and searching for 
materials, clusters of 
students are seen 

everywhere, concentrating 
heavily on schoolwork. 
Librarians offer help in 
finding anything to aid 
research, and are stationed 
at the information desk to 
assist students. 

The card catalog is one of 
the best ways to find in- 
formation. The information 
in the card catalogs could, in 
the near future, be replaced 
by computers. "If you're not 



sure of a topic, you 

key word search," said Judy 



the library for student use.

The library has a loan 
service available for 
students. When the library 
doesn't have the particular 
source needed, the 
necessary materials may be 
ordered from another 
library. University archives 
are available for those in- 
terested in the history of 
IPFW. Pamphlets on various 
subjects are located 
throughout the library. 

The library has (our floors, 
with smoking allowed on 
floors one, two, and four; 
floor three is strictly a non- 
smoking, quiet study area. 
Typewriters are available in

The opinions of students 
are mixed about the library 

"I feel the library fulfills 
me with an adequate amount 
of reference materials," 
stated Andy Richards, a 
freshman at IPFW. 

Students do have differing 
views of the library, 
however. "There wasn't 
enough updated material," 
according lo IPFW fresh- 
man Gregg Meek. But the 
library is there to aid 
students. 

Violette recalls a 
humorous moment in 
helping one student at the 
library: "One student asked 
for a catharsis when he 
really wanted a thesaurus."

'Tobacco Road,' PIT's seasonal opener: 
an action packed and superbly acted play. 



By M.KATHLEEN 

GREVEN 

Features Editor 

Jeeter Lester just stole a 
burlap bag ot winter turnips , 
Ada, his wife, yearns for a 
stylish dress so that she can 
lay down and die now and 
Grandma is a bag lady. 

To complicate matters, the 
kids are out of control — 
Ellie May is rolling around in 
the front yard with her 
sister's husband and Dude is 
openly fondling the preacher 
woman. 

Welcome to life on 
"Tobacco Road" where it's 
summertime, but the living 
ain't easy. 

PIT's season opener, 
"Tobacco Road," is directed 
by Larry Life and sure to be 
enjoyed by all. 

The tattered and energetic 
cast members bring the 
Lester clan and their friends 
to life amid the Depression in 
the deep south. 

Salch Gatchell and 
Doranna Pelhel are very 
good together as the 
squabbling rural couple, 
Jeeter and Ada Lester. They 
tear al each other verbally 
and physically in a desperate 
attempt to communicate. 




Gatchel portrays a God 
fearing, food stealing 
patriarch of a barren parcel 
of land with all (he ferocity of 
a badger defending what's 
rightfully his. 

He strides, stumbles, 
screams, stomps and 
schemes his way through

life, defending life as it once 
was — for the land he'd 
grown up on. 

Jeeter's wife. Ada, longs 
for her snuff, thinking that if 
she didn't have any food, at 
least she could be in less 
pain. After bearing 17 
children, she's gone through 
enough pain! 

Pethtel brought Ada's no- 
nonsense attitude to life. 
When she caught her 
husband napping on the 
porch, a good swift kick was 
administered for motivation. 
iMaybefathering 17 children 
had just tuckered him out! ) 

Her stooped posture and 
slightly disheveled hair 
illustrated the weariness she 
felt. She was tired of never 
having a full belly and of 
wearing rags. Despite this 
weariness, she too fought a 
fierce battle — for her 
family. 

Jeeter's loyalty to the land 
and Ada's concern for her 
children is a conflict that the 
two fight to the death — but 
the winner is never declared. 

To balance out Jeeter's 
procrastination and Ada's 
weariness, Ellie May and 
Dude displayed a zest for 
active recreation — or 



should that be procreation? 

Susan Bloom spends a lot 
of her lime scooting around 
in the dirt, latching onto any 
unsuspecting male who 
wanders within range. She 
lends a pathetic quality to 
the apparently inbred Ellie 
May. The only time her face 
lit up was when she was 
■'with" a man. 

Dude takes an active in- 
terest in sex, loo, but is more 
materialistic about it. Brad 
Allen Beauchamp portrays 
the anger and frustration of 
a teenage boy with boundless 
energy — but no fulure. 

He's happy to play around 
with Sisler Bessy Rice, the 
traveling preacher, until she 
asks him to marry her The 
offer is declined, until Bessy 
reveals her plans to buy a 
new car. When promised 
that the car will have a horn, 
the groping resumes and the 
marriage arrangements 
begin. 

The nuptial bliss isn't long- 
lived. Soon, the outspoken 
Bessy, played en- 

thusiastically by Susan 
Horine, and the confused 
Dude are acting like a 
youriger version of Jeeter 
and Ada.

Throughout all this action, 

irandma Lester, a 
quivering soul clad In a 
tangle of black rags, does 
her bag lady imitation. 

Myra Mae McFarland's 
characterization or the mute 
old woman is quite touching. 
She cowers in the weeds 
while the family argues, 
eager to be clear of the flying 
feet and fists. 

Despite her unobtrusive 
demeanor, she manages to 
steal many of the free-for-all 
scenes! The moment a hat, 
coke bottle, marriage license 
or scrap of fabric was left 
within her reach, it became 
hers. 

She'd plop the ragged 
straw hats or shreds of lace 
on her head and stuff other 
"usable" items furtively into 
her burlap bag. When 
Grandma was around, there 
was no such thing as a 
permanent possession! 

Jeeter felt very differently 
about possessions. He ex- 
pected ownerships to be non- 
transferable, even when (he 
possession is his own child. 
Pearl had run away from her 
husband, Luv Bensey, who 
bribes Jeeler with food and 
money to capture Pearl and 
bring her back to him. 
(Actually, Jeeter isn't 
Pearl's biological father, but 
that's another story.) 

The shy Pearl, a mulatto, 
is played by Donette Blanks. 
She demonstrates the 
devotion and skittishness 
common in an adolescent 
girl under the control of a 
man she fears. 

Her husband, Luv, 
desperately wants Pearl 
back — and Kim Detwiler 
grimaces, pleads and bribes 
his way into convincing 
Jeeter to help him regain his 
property. 

The action is intensified by 
the physical oppression of 
the moss dripping from the 
"trees" overhead, the 
tumbled down shack and the 
dirt covering Ihe yard and 
the family's clothes. 

This barren patch of dirt 
was the very thing he fought 
for, Even if it wasn't much, 
at least it was his.

Intramurals: An opportunity for everyone to enjoy 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 

Sports Editor 
Intramurals provide a 
chance for students and 
faculty alike to be 
athletically competitive. 
Many sports are available 
for competition. If an in- 
terest is shown in a sport not 



offered, however, a league or 
tourney will be organized. 
Although the intramural 
teams are not playing 
against teams from other 
colleges, the competitive 
spirit is not lost. In 
basketball, for instance, 12 
men's teams are divided into 



two "pools," or groups. The 
six teams in each pool play 
five games each against the 
teams in their respective 
pool; thus a total of IS games 
are played in the "regular 
season." In the Tegular 
season," the teams play once 
a week, at 6:30 and 7:30 on

An IPFW alum plays 
against a University of 
Southern Indiana alum in the

Last week, the IPFW soccer 
team pulled to within one 
game of the .500 mark with a 
S-i win over Grace College. 
The Mastodons were 5-6 
heading into Wednesday's 



game against Miami of Ohio 
Juan Diaz had two of 
tPFW's goals against Grace, 
and leads the team with 15

Bronn Pfeiffer has 11 points

Mondays. 

On Nov. 25, the basket- 
bailers begin their single- 
elimination tournament, 
with the top three teams 
from each pool par- 
ticipating The top two 
finishers are given cer- 
tificates for their efforts. 
"It's not a gold medal, but 
it's a reward," says Lisa 
Sheehan, the head of student 
assistants for the intramural 
program, who is also an 
assistant coach for IPFW's 
women's volleyball team. 

Sheehan is not only in- 
volved with the Mastodon's 
women's volleyball team, 
but with the intramural 
volleyball squads as well. 
Three co-ed volleyball teams 
compete against each other 
in the same manner as the 
basketball squads, playing 
once a week, on Tuesday 
evenings. The volleyballers 
have a single-elimination 
tourney at the end of their 
regular league play as well. 

The only prerequisite for 
playing in the intramural 
league is to complete a form 
for the particular sport. 
These forms are available in 
the Multipurpose Building, 



attached to the bulletin extra time) 



board on the first floor. The 
rules for the competitions 
are posted there as well, 
along with the current 
tournament statistics when 
appropriate The entries for 
tne intramural program 
must be turned in three 
weeks before the deadline 
for the fall and spring 
programs, unless ex- 
tenuating circumstances 
permit an extension. "If a 
player really wants to 
participate and doesn't 
make the deadline, it can be 
extended," Sheehan says. 
Basketball and volleyball 
are only two of the various 
intramural events that are 
offered Racquetball, 
billiards, and an addition to 
the list this year, bench 
press, began last week. 
Table tennis, co-ed Softball 
and an additional bench 
press competition will be 
going on in the spring, as 
well as a 5,000-meter and one 
mile spring run. "We're 
trying new things this year," 
Sheehan comments. 
"Sometimes it's hard, 
though, getting people in- 
volved, because IPFW is a 
commuter campus, and 
many people have jobs

program has grown 
however. "There was kind of 
a lull last year, but this year 
there is more interest," 
Sheehan says. "It's working 
very well." 

Sheehan is one of four 
student assistants to the 
head of the program, IPFW 
women's volleyball coach 
Arnie Ball. Others include 
Kris Espy, Loren Gebert, 
and Troy White Sheehan's 
interest in intramurals was 
sparked several years ago 
by Ball, and she has been 
"hooked ever since." It's a 
neat experience working 
with all of the people It's 
really amazing how it's 
grown in the four years I've 
been involved," Sheehan 

Unlike college competitive 
teams, anyone is eligible to 
participate on the in- 
tramural team(s) of his or 
her choice, as previously 
slated. "You can put as 
much time (into the games) 
as you want to," Sheehan 
says. "It's not as demanding 
las NCAA college com- 
petition)." 

"It's mostly for your own 
benefit You're there to play 
and have fun — that's what 
it's all about."

Spikers victorious, improving 




B&gt; ANDREA SYTS MA 
Staff Reporter 

The IPFW women's 
volleyball team, coached by 
Arnie Ball, is the defending 
champion of the Great Lakes 
Valley Conference. Although 
the team is relatively young 
and inexperienced, this 
season they are improving, 
especially evident within the 
last two weeks. The team's 
maturity, both skillwise and 
mentally, has improved 
within the last month. 

The team is doing rather 
well, despite their inex- 
perience. Last weekend, 
they played Northern 
Michigan, Wright State, 
Saint Joseph, Indiana 
Central, and Bellarmine in 
the Wright State University 
Invitational. They won four 
of the six matches, and were 



close to victory in their two 
losses. The Mastodons began 
the evening with a tough loss 
to Northern Michigan, 10-15, 
16-14 and 11-15. In the second 
game, against number one- 
ranked Wright State, IPFW 
lost a second close match, 15- 
3, H-15, and 11-15. In their 
next contest, they defeated 
Saint Joseph and Franklin 
College, two games to one, 
and shut-out Indiana Central 
and Bellarmine both in only 
two games. 

Ball expects the team to be 
a contender for the GLVC 
conference championship, 
coming up in November. 

The volleyball team has 
many good players, in- 
cluding Julie Hefty, who 
leads the team with 190 kills 
and 81 blocked shots, and 



Judy Yagodinski, leading the 
team with 28 service aces, 

Some of the team's strong 
points are their overall 
abilities on offense, as well 
as their serve and pass 
receiving. Some of the things 
needing improvement are 
the back row defense, 
transition offense, and 
passing the ball over the net 
with regularity, according to 
Ball The team is also 
working on their serves. 

The Lady Mastodons' next 
contest is the Wright State 
rematch, at the Multipur- 
pose Building. According to 
Ball, the Raiders are the 
toughest team the 
Mastodons have played thus 
far, and they look forward to 
playing them next week, 
with confidence. Game time 
is set for 7 p.m. on Ocl. 23.
