Angels' patrol 
waste of time: 
Carnaghi 

ByMIKEROECER 

Edltor-ln -Chief 

IPFW's vice chancellor tor financial affairs believes the Guardian Angels would 
be wasting Iheir time if they decide to patrol the campus. 

In a published story Inst Friday. The Journal- Gaicltc reported the Guardian 
Angels Is considering a chapter (or Fori Wayne. 1PFW was reported as one ol the 
-pi nets they may patrol. 

"From what I've heard," said John Carnaghi, vice chancellor for financial 
alfairs, "they do awfully good deeds. However, it would be a waste of their time 
mid effort 'if they decide to patrol on campus)." 

The Guardian Angels are an international group that patrols without weapons. 
They formed In New York City In 1379. They currently have chapters In 47 U.S. 
cities and lour Canadian Cllies. 

Curtis Sliwo. Ihe Angels founder, plans to visit Fort Wayne later this month, 
possibly Feb. 20 to 22. During his slay, he will visit the areas they are considering 
patrolling^ 

"1PFW Is not a high-crime rate area," Carnaghi said. "Any crime we do have, 
we can adequately handle." 

Maurice Shady, chief of police, said he wasn't familiar with the reports and 
couldn't comment. 

In addition to 1PFW. the Angels may patrol Memorial Coliseum, Canterbury 
Green and residential areas with high break-in rates.

Miller Brewing Company today owns

How this was accomplished was Ihe 
topic of a seminar brought to IPFW by 
Bhagabab Panigrabi, assistant 
professor of marketing, and presented 
by William Rcuhl of Miller. 

In 1970 cigarette giant, Phillip 
Morris, bought the long time famlly- 
Dwncd Miller Brewing Company. 
Phillip Morris had considerable 
marketing experience whli

Miller was that BO percent of beer 
consumed is by 30 percent of Ihe people 
who buy beer. 

Unique to Miller Is Ihe clear bottle. 
Most other brewers use a dark brown 
bottle to preserve the beer from 
spoilage, but Miller uses special 
brewing techniques that makes the use 
of dark bottles unnecessary lexcept In 
Canada where it is required by law). 
Anol her marketing technique used by 
Miller was emphasliing time (thus

This seminar by Miller was a first In 
what could possibly be a series. "I

The Public Trail sporta (ion Company 
has decided lo add a Glenbrook Square 
lo Soulhtown Mall bus route through 
IPFW. 

This route is unique, in that il doesn't 
go through the bus transfer point 
downtown The buses will travel bet- 
ween Soulhtown and 1PFW on Anthony 
Boulevard. This will benefit students 
living near Anthony. 

However, the bus company will run 
the route only on Saturdays beginning 
March 3. 

The bus company is losing ridership 
and money, yet il decides to run a 
potentially lucrative route only on 
Saturdays While most IPFW students 
don't use the buses, many do, 



With the added route, more IPFW 
students may use the bus on Saturdays. 
However, the buses still do not run from 
IPFW to Glenbrook any other day of the 
week Many students may work at 
Glenbrook or want to shop there. 

The bus company should immediately 
increase service lo IPFW. The school 
and the bus company would both benefit 
from increased service. More students 
riding the bus would mean increased 
revenues for the bus company. 

The IPFW Students' Government 
should lobby the bus company calling for 
increased service. The bus company 
management may not even realize bus 
servicers needed lo and from school.
