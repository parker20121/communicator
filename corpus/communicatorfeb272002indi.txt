By 17, she was homeless. 
She lound her way, however, 



to Noilhtm lllmoLS Univcriil&gt; 
where she graduated magna

So when HIV came into her

Until \3s\ Wednnd.iy. I thought I had heard a\] the rea- 
sons people (houghl we were altjckcd on Sept. II. To my

Separation of 
church and state: 
A new battle? 



By Andrew Howard, Sta/f Writer 

Indiana's house of senate is 
currently considering a new bill 
that would immecfialely force 
public schools lo post the motto 
In Cod We Trust' in every class- 

With that said, I would like 
to offer an open invilalion to all 
those individuals who were so 
adamant against IPFW's produc- 
tion of "Corpus Chris ti" lo stand 
up. 

Let your voices be heard. We 
have a new battle lo Fight. It's a 
violation of our rights. Lei's hear 
il. Scream il oul loud. Cry separa- 
tion of church and stale! 

No? I don't sec any volun^ 
teen, no hands and no signs o! 
protest. Oh, surely we have not 
given up so easily. We can fight 
inis. Oh, I see. We don't disagree 
with this now do we? 

Il seems thai the complaints, 
the editorials and the constant 
healing Ihat IPFW look were not 
for Ihe rcasoru that were pro- 
claimed. For of course, il Ihcy 
were, Ihen surely you loyalists 
would stand up against this outrage. 

Dut of course you won't. 

This issue is not about Ihe 
public display of the Uruled Stales 
of America's national mollo, even 
one that might contain a govern- 
ment's cndoisemcnl of religion. 

nol about a perform' 
;iou5 topics al a pub- 
I school. Rather, it's 
nstani hypocrisy that 
)ur nation, claiming 
only a charade for Ihe 
of the protesters. We 
are over-sensitive lo any possible 
opinion or ideas that may not 
only influence young minds, but 
may also dilfer from our own. 

In the scandal thai surround- 
ed Ihc performance ol 'Corpus 
Christi," which proved to be a 
wonderful marketing campaign 
lor Ihe play. Christians stepped 
fonvard and even filed a lawsuit 
against IPHV for a violation of 
separation of church and stale. 
So why nol step forivard 

and do Ihe same for the pos- 

young stu- 



It wasn't about separati 
church and slate. People 
appalled al the idea that soir 
miehl question or reflect on ideas 
and morals of which they could 



I know, now we'll see justifi- 
cation, from individuals such as 
Senator johnny Nugent who pro- 
posed the bill, that it is palriolic 
and historically significant. 

We'll hear the arguments 
that il will help lo belter unite 
ids and help Ihem to find Ihcir 









Chrisli" wai 
ance of relij 
licly fundei 
about Ihc ct 
surrounds 



The idea of displaying the 
mollo in schools does not seem lo 
be Ihat big of a deal lo me because 
I realize officials' urgency lo help 
better promote a futile allempi at 
pride and patriotism now. 

We've been subjecting kids to 
this for many years already with 
Ihe common ritual of standing up 
every morning and chanting a 
pledge of allegiance thai refers to 
'one nation under God." I have 
stronger confidence in Ihe young 
students in America, I want to 
believe they can actually think for 
thcmsek-es and make their own 
decisions, regardless of the ir\flu- 
ences thai surround them. 

Of course, those who choose 
not to think as individuals are not 
likely lo be swayed by these mes- 
sages in the first place. 

But let's lind a balance Ihat 
does not waver. Let's slick lo what 
wcsay. If Cod isin Iheclassnxim, 
so be II. Knot, then fine. However, 
il a constant debate will arise 
every time people see something 
that does not conform with their 
moral or spiritual ideas, Ihen 
accept thai you cannot have il 
both ways. 

It is America's freedom thai 
makes patriotism flourish, nol 
some misspoken slogan. 

And to all believers, lo all 
those who ranted over "Corpus 
Chrisli," to Mr. Mark Souder, a 
reminder Ihat freedom of religion 
is not just about freedom of what 
religion you choose, but also the 
freedom to choose no religion. 



Firsl of all, 1 would like to poutt out 
that this editorial is not an attack on the 
Muslim faith. II is not my intention lo 
offend anyone who regards himself as a 
Muslim as I am aware that there are sever- 
al who attend this university who do. 

1 fully realize that all religions, espe- 
cially Chnstianity. have created ugliness 
throughout history. Not all terrorists are 
Muslirrvs. All religions have fundamental- 
ists and extremisls who go beyond the 
realms of morality in the name of Iheir 
faith. But in the case of Islam, il is not jusi 
the fundamentalists and eitrcmisis who 
need to change, it is Ihe religion itself. 

It is not the actual doctrine and creed 
of Islam that needs to change- In fact, Islam 
does very well in preaching goodwill 
toward humanity and the preciousness of 
life. But it is the issue of modernity thai 
presents the greatest challenge to Islam. 

I'm nol sayutg that every other reli- 
gion has accepted globalism, democracy. 
technolo^ and capitalism with open arms, 
but the Muslim faith seems lo be severely 
lacking in this area. There are other issues 
Ihat constitute modemily such as women'J 
nghls. tolerance and diversi^. 

Let's start with democracv. Most of the 
nations thai constitute the Muslim world 
are not democratic, but rather monarchies 
or dictatorships. Even Ihe United States' 
current ally Pakistan has a leader who ille- 
gally look control ol power through a mili- 



tary coup, yet he calls himself a president. 
Civil rights and liberties such as freedom of 
speech arc almost invisible in these nations. 
I don't know if anyone can argue Ihat 



Staff 
Editorial 



The outlawmg of women from cer- 
tain professions and attaining educatioru in 
these countries must end. Hopefully this 
will be the result in the new Afghanistan 
under interim leader Karzai. 

The tolerance and diversity issues may 
go hand in hand. These tivo specific cful- 
lenges could be the most serious ones 
plaguing Islam. 

There are many ethnic groups in the 
Muslim world who consider themselves as 
persecuted minorities in their respective 
nations. The Tajiks and Uzbeks ir 
Afghanistan and the Kurds in northern are 
some who fall into that category, just Ic 
name a few. Racism and . 



no more prevalent there than in UraeL 

If the Palestinians can learn to tolerate 
Iheir lighler- skinned lewish neighbors, 
then peace could exist in a slate that has 
seen blood for 17 months. 

Much of the Muslim world has social 
and political inslitutioiu that seem almost 
medieval. 

Because Islam has such an influence in 
this part of the world, Muslim leaders must 
begin preaching acceptance of modernity 
and everything that constitutes such 
beliefs. This is when terrorism will stop. 
Because terrorism is a political attack on 
human progress, it wil[ end when Islam 
accepts human progress. 

The Haji, Ihe world's largest annual 
religious pilgrimage, has just recently 
ended. Hopefully, Muslim leaders ol Saudi 
Arabia took Ihc opportunity to condemn 
the actions ol Islamic militants and con- 
done modernity because this is their 
responsibility. As leaders, Ihey need to set 
the example. 

Muslims may feel that in accepting 
modernity, they will lose their faith and val- 
ues. They need to realize that even irifhe 
most modem nation of the world, religion 
still thrives alongside women's rights, tol- 
erance, diversity and democracy 



sible tragedy o 



Cod ui the classroom? 



Verbal photographs: 

By Mateo FeKskers, Staff Writer 

Jnle turned each page, and learnt of 
her through his lashes. The clock marked 
another hour's passing, unnoticed. The 
music took up in him and swelled and 
thrived until tears quivered above the 
pages. He gently silenced the volume and 
reminded himself to breathe. 



As though waking up, the new world around him cloaked 
itself in color, sound, pleasure and pain, the hours of which he 
had passed ignorant. He smiled to himself, the newborn's cry of 
arrival Riled the room. A captivating smile, il was neither glad 
nor self-satisfied — it was merely a reflection of that moment to 
that specific mind. The more moments we capture, the more we 
will smile al them. 

There was something in that exception of a day. Ihat 
remembered moment, when she looked at him through the cups. 
He was going through the motioits ol a tvage-eamer. pouring 
and liKing drmks, when what fell like spider-thread fell on his 
eyelashes and leveled his gaze lo hers. There she stood, looking 
through the cups, with what appeared to be a kiss creeping onto 
her lips and eyes that were neither betivecn sleeping or waking. 
The inihal reaction passed and yet the moment endured, and 
thcii gazes met and decided things for Iheir own volihon. It was 
neither time nor discomfort that deemed that moment trai\sitary. 
but its lifetime spent, its silence broken, his eyes relumed to his 
work while his mind went to an unexplored region of thought 
that burned behind his eyes and shimmered in his i "^"~ 



His mind had to find shelter from repercussion, immediate- 
ly, anvlhing. His mind unaware, he dropped to tie his shoe — 
he'd tieen doing this since kindergarten. As he stood up, he 
heard his singing trail off. What left to do bul sigh and exfiale 
that moment into memory? The rest of the day he passed in 
uncor\scious labor and profound Ihinking. On her. On whatever 
had been communicated; on Ihe fact that he woke up in a world 
of her. On whatever had been commurucated; on the fact thai he 
woke up in a world of facts that morning and now felt totally 
adrift. He had always pursued mental stimulation, but Ihe world 
of emotion and spirit tiad set him in an entirely powerless and 
preferable position. His mind, so often succinctly exact and 
adroitly eloquent, began to crall language to Ihe ends of his 
heart, giving him moments instead of answers. The work day 
closed, he found himself outside Ihe coffee shop in the vostness 
of the outside world, and it seemed his entire mind was imme- 
diately projected onto the vastness of Ihe universe before him. 
He uttered to himself what he had been lhir\king all day: 

And I called this name in the winter night 

And it echoed on quiel snow fields 

And was taken up into moonlight 

To fall back on my face, on my lashes 

And I saw the sound thai had traveled so far 

Of her name, my world around it. and of longing 

Colors bounced in the fog of that day. and survival seemed 
arbitrary now that he knew life. What is food to a well-fed but 
thoroughly urisalisfied man? What is sleep to a burning mind? 
What is water to the thirst of desire? All inconsequentiaf 

It felt like minutes when he lifted his eyes from his feet and 
found he had stopped walking. Man. my ear must be a million 
miles away, he thought. Where am l?The repose of early evening 
had drifted into the nervous and agitahng silence of the pre- 
dawn hours, the violent darkness denying Ihat light tud ever 
played on the sidewalk he tapped upon.

For those who suspect a 
friend may suffer from an eat- 
ing disorder, the National 
Eating Disorders Screening 
Program has published a 
brochure explaining several 
warning signs that could indi- 
cate someone has a problem. 
Such signs include significant 
loss or eain in weight, calcula- 
tion of the number of fat grams 
in each bite of food, constant 
worry over size and shape.

After the movie scores were 
fmished came the classics that the 
newly refurbished organ al Ibc 
Embassy is able lo play. These 
included Jerome Kern's "Smoke 
Gels In Your Eyes" and "I Won'l 
Dance,*' a lune Ihal James calls "a 
toe- tapper." 

(list before the intermission 
and true to form of Ihe old silent 
ie house days, there was a 
sing-a-long. Complele with the 
wonjs on a screen, bul ivilhout the 
bouncing ball, about 200 audience 
members sang "You're A Grand 
Ole' Flag- 



When the mtcrmission came 
lo an end, the house filled up again, 
and we all sal and watched "Seven 
Chances" starring Busier Keaton. 
who also directed Ihe film. 

The film was made wilh Ihe 
help ol two fellows named Metro 
and Coldwynn who owned a stu- 
dio that no one thought would ever 
accomplish much. Eventually, a 
third partner was added by the 
name of Mayer, No one thought 
much of him al the lime, either. 

K eat on plays a young man 
who i.E in a business parlncrship 
with a friend named. Billie. The 
partnership is so successful that 
kealon has lo raise a large amounl 
of money in a not-so-large amounl 
of lime, otherwise both men will be 
taking a little vacation at the Grey 
Bar Hotel. 

As luck may have it. a relative 
of Kea Ion's conveniently dies and 
leaves him S7 million. The dead 
man's lawyer informs Kealon of 
one slight condition; Kealon musi 

An 

offends his current girlfriend by 
saying, in silence ol course, that "he 
must marry some girl." VVhen his 
girlfriend clecides not to marry him 
on IhLs principle, il is up to Billie 
and the lawyer to find a bride-to-be, 

Billie comes up with a list of 
seven n.imes for seven dames, all of 
which are eliminated as Kealon 
learns thai proposing lo a woman 
nose-lo-nosc in a phone booth is^ 
not Ihc best idea. 

In the meantime, the girlfriend 
is persuaded by her mother to give 
Kealon a second chance. To do so. 
she sends olf a message wilh Ihe 
gardener on a horse Ihal moves 
slower than a Yugo on 1-69. 

Al the same lime. Billie decid- 
ed la put an add in the paper 
advertising Keaton's situation, 
promising that the Sirsl girl lo make 
il to a ceriain church by 5 o'clock 
will wed a millionaire- 

Keaton arrives at the church 
and sits in the front row. For a few 
minutes, every single gal in loivn 
grabs a wedding veil and fills up 
Ihc church, the steps up lo the 
church, the street outside and Ihc 
blocks around the church. 

In other words, there were 
more than enough Eves lo go

and exits from the olhcr. He is near- 
ly hit by a train. He is picked up by 
a crane and dumped on Ihe olhcr 
side of a fence- He outruns Ihe 
women chasing him by jumping 
cliff to cliff separated by a ^lly. 
On one occasion. Kealon jumps 
into a fur tree thai is being cut 
down and rides it lo Ihc ground. 

Then comes a sequence where 
massive looking boulders are tum- 
bling behind Kealon. who is trying 
desperately to make il lo his girl- 
friend's house in one piece- 

The chase scene went on for 10 
mmutes and embodied Ihc classic 
humor brought by clever slapstick 
and Ihe visual geruus needed to 
make Ihings furmy without sound. 

When it was all over. Kealon 
married his girl and gol the S? mil- 
lion and organist E&gt;ennis James got 
the applajise for his first half con- 
cert and his second half accompani- 
ment to the movie providing the 
non-stop, mood-selling music and 
sound effects.

Stances of laughter as we watched 
le passage of time in Ihe film 
being marked by a dog that grew 
larger and larger and a car thai 
remained slalionary. The scene dis- 
solved inio another to show travel 
and the ever-present people who 
can't tell lime showed up 20 min- 
utes late. 



Them 

an era gone by that gave way lo Ihe 
Hollywood that saw the. end lo Ihe 
studio-system, the sell-out houses 
lost to television, until what wc 
finally see now. We have seen Ihe 
evidence of the technological 
advancement of culture. 

The day also reminded me of 
how sad it is that the ground work 
that leads the way lo our current 
slate in film has long been forgol- 
len. Sadly, many of those reading 
this column iwlil not knoiv who 
Valentino was. Nor will they know 
that "The Tramp" is Chaplin's nick- 
name. They will not know that 
Kealon was responsible for Ihc 
trend in film that brought about the 
all-important Iraruformallon from 
slapstick humor lo Ihe comic situa- 
tions we all love to laugh al today 

Much as 1 would like lo 
remain perched atop my horse, 
preaching Ihe unfortunate knowl- 
edge lacking in hislory, 1 have to 
confess that while wriling this 
week's edition, I gal fogg\' on one 
or two details. I had lo call a friend 
of mine. Harvey Cocks, who shares 
the same love of entertainment his- 
lory and archaic, useless trivia that 
would only serve us well on game

arc victims of a practical joke. That 
is when Ihc classic silent film chase 
scene begins. Kealon jumps out of a 
window where he meets Ihe gar- 
dener, who gives him the message. 



(By the way. Sam 
eventually left MGM, despite his 
initial being kept.)

There will be other lii-e bands entertain- 
ing patrons the firsi Saturdav ol each month. 
The doors open al 8 P.m. and close at 11 p.m. 
Narrowgate 7-13 will also be open each Ihird 
Saturday nighl ol Ihc monlh. abo from 8 p.m. 
until II p.m. 

On those nights. Cearbaugh says they 
will be having any manner of creative cnlcr- 
tainmcnt such as talent shows, open mikes, 
special readings or possibly soothing 
acoustic guitar for background music- 

Ccarbaugh is open to any creative ideas 
that anyone would care to Sliare. However, 
lor Ihc time being. Narrowgate 7-13 will only 
be able lo be open those Qic rirsl and Ihird

Coffeehouses are famous for Ihcii intel- 
lectual crowd and fun get-logclhers and 
Narrowgate 78-13 promises lobe no different. 

Feel free lo bring your friends, class- 
mates or that special other person in your hie 
and you'll be sure lo finci some wonderful 
fellowship, as well as an opportunity to meet 
others looking for some fun people without

Wc have all said that we wished there 
was a place adulLs could go and meet people 
from our own age and inleivsl groups with- 
out having to spent the whole evening silting 
in a bar and spending a fortune. 

Another plus is Ihe way colfeehouscs 
have thai almost magical power to make you 
feel very bohcmian m spirit. According to 
IPFW's Jenny Hulson. "This is the place lo 
be." Several other students have been heard 
expressing interesi in spending a lew 
evenings, at the very Icosl, soaking up Ihe 
ambiance thai seem to be such a reminder of 
traditional coffeehouses.

The agreement, which marked

to be valuable assets in his

This university is going to be

Rebuilding the university is 
not only critical to improving the 
quality of life in Afghanistan, 
but abo to reducing terrorism, 
said Wallace Tyncr, head ol 
Purdue's Department ol

TWo main root causes of ter-

The meetings represented the 
first steo in an effort that could 
take a decade to achieve. Pact of 
that effort will include sending a 
Purdue delegation to 
Afghanistan, possibly as early as 
March, Tyner said.

Before lunch, there was an 
opportimity to meet with legis- 
lators at the slatehouse and 
invite them to attend Ihe lunch. 
Dale Shjrtz, D-Lagrangc; Gary 
Dillon, R-Cotumbia City; Dermis 
Kruse, R-Auburn and Phyllis 
Pond, R-New Haven joined the 
IPFW group (or lunch. 

"These ate (our of the 18 leg- 
islators we hope will come 
together as a team and get IPFW 
equity and tectmology funding," 
Bosk said. 

After lunch, there was anoth- 



IPFW campus on Saturday to tell 
her story. 

Lcwis-Thomlon. now 39, is an 
attractive, thin woman, who, as 
she says, doesn't seem like 
someone who has (ull-blown 
AIDS. As a result of the virus, 
she has a weakened inununc 
system, yet she still remains 
healthy and lit. Lewis-Thornton 
lakesadrugcocklail of three dif- 
ferent medications to fight the 
virus and works out every day. 

"People say all the time, 'You 
make it look easy. It's as if you 
don't hurt-' When 1 speak, peo- 



er opportunity lo meet with leg- 
islators at the statehouse. The 
IPFW group was able lo talk lo 
most ol the area legislators and 
many students presented their 
legislators with calculators, 
which were purchased by 
Hoosiers (or Higher Education. 

Students were also distribut- 
ing IPFW (lag pins. Dan 
Westrick. 2001 IPFW graduate, 
said that he was optimistic: 'The 
legislators that I talked to 
seemed genuinely concerned 
about equity (unding and fund- 



about it? Where would you 
start? What would your pnori- 
ties be?" Tyner said. 

The list of about a dozen peo- 
ple who attended the three-day 
conference included Mir A. 
Raza, former minister o( agncul- 
ture and water resources: A. 
Tawab Assifi, fonner minister of 
mines and industries: and Jo ma 
M. Mohamad i. former minister 
of water and power. 

Purdue has a long history o( 
"institution building," or creat- 
ing educational iiutitutions from 
scratch, in A(rica and South 
America. Purdue (acuity and 
their peers at several other 

iiutrumcntal in developing the 
engineering program at Kabul 
University during the 1960s and 
1970s. Purdue also was a major 
player in rebuilding Taiwan's 



pie (orget. 1 make it easy (or you 
to receive some hard in(orma- 
tion. I want to remind you that I 
am dying. AIDS lakes every sin- 
gle thing I have, every single day" 
Oden, she says, she is so tired 
and weak when she wakes up in 
the morning she can hardly get 
out of bed. Yet she continues to 
persevere. Her perseverance has 
lead her to become an M.A. can- 
didate at the University of 
Illinois. She is also enrolled in 
McCormick Theological 
Seminary, where she is working 
on a Master's in Divinity. 



World War IL Cheng Kung is 
noiv a leadmg engineering uni- 
versity in Taiwan. 

Shortly after the Soviet Union 
invaded Afghanistan in 1979, 
engineering education at Kabul 
University was abolished, said 
Afghan native Zatjon Baha. a 
professor in the Department of 
BuiUingConstructian Management 
in Purdue's School of Technology. 

Baha was the last dean of 
engineering at Kabul Univcisity. 
He left Afghanistan in 1982, 
when he joined the Purdue fac- 
ulty. Baha said he had directly 
benefited (com the influence of 
American universities during 
the 1960s, when he and other tal- 
ented young students were 
brought to the United States to 
pursue degrees. 



Above and beyond that, 
Lcwis-Thomton found the lime 
to become licensed as a Baptist 
minister in July 2000 at 
Fellowship Baptist Church in 
Chicago. 

Her message to her audiences 
often comes not in the form of 
'Don't have sen or you'll gel 
HIV,' but 'You shouldn't put 
your life up agaic^t a sexual 
experience.' "What matters in 
the real world is we always have 
the choice." Thornton-Lewis 
says, "I stand here and accept 
the choices I've made." 



India: 

Unforhinatcly, an armual trip 
to the statehouse by a small por- 
tion of IPFW supporiers may not 
be enough. 

Those interested in funding 
issues can continue lo help by 
contacting Iheir legislators and 
asking them for their support.

legal name and address in any 
correspondence with legislators

By Andy Welfle, Staff Writer 

Be excited... .spring break is almost 
here. Students all over the campus are 
going to Florida, the Bahamas, 
California or other places equally as 
sunny and warm. Me, I'm taking 
a shopping trip for a day to 
Chicago with my girlfriend. 
While It will be fun, I won't 
exactly come back showing off a 
tan. 

For those of us who won't 
be leaving the climate zone over 
break, there are a few different 
options lo fake it. 

You can go to a tanning 
salon, and use a tanning bed. 
However, there arc certain risks 
with these beds, involving UV 
rays and skin cancer. There is 
also tanning lotion you can buy 
from a slore and apply. 
Unfortunately, many of these products 
can leave a person with an orange tint lo 
their skin, instead of a natural golden- 
brown. 

There is also another lesser-known 
alternative in Fort Wayne involving 
being sprayed with a tanning mist. 
When my editor asked me if I would 
like lo review a mist-on farming salon, 
I'll admit. 1 had my reservations. I'm a 
much more competent restaurant critic 
than a tanning salon critic, mostly 
because reviewing restaurants does not 
involve stripping naked in a strange 
place, and being bombarded with a 
bronze-colored spray, I thought about it 
more and more, and decided that I 
should do it. I wouldn't mind a healthy 
tan for spring break, and as I tan like a 
match-head, I might as well give it a 
shot. Besides. 1 certainly won't be get- 
ting a tan wandering through the aisles 
of Marshall Fields in the great 
Windy City of Chicago. yon 

Living in Fori Wayne, or Tkjfig.^ __ f f~* ^^ 7^k« T ^' 
the immediate surrounding XYMi^i- wi \JV J.Uf&amp;f AttC 
area, we have two choices 
for a mist-on tan. On the 
north end of town resides the 
newest player in the mdustry. 
Mist n' Go Tan, located at 512 
Noble Road, in the same shopping cen- 
ter as Tokens-n-Tickels and the Cookie 
Collage- On the southwest side of town 
is the defending champion. Sun Mist 
Tan, at 7521 West Jefferson Boulevard 
and Engle Road. Both salons feature the 
same technology, a large machine called 
Dr Laughlin's Mist-on Tan. 

More about the differences between 
the two places in a minute. First, I will 
quickly run you through the process of 
misting on a Ian. First you are lent the 
use of a dressing room, where you take 
off your clothes (yes, all you modest 
people like myself, ALL of your clothes), 
and put on a robe, flip-flops and a cap to 



Your 



knowledgeable 
instructor will 
show you a few 

positions to stand 
in while being 
sprayed, to maxi- 
mize coverage of 
the solution. Then you are left alone. Let 
me tell you, it is rather intimidating to 
beinaroomwithabigblack machine 
wearing nothing but a little surgical cap, 
especially if this is your hrst time m a 
place like this. You step into Dr. 
Laughlin's contraption, push a button, 
and allow yourself to be sprayed. It is 
slightly on the windy side, and the solu- 
tion smells unusual, but the back of the 
machine is ventilated, so you aren't 
breathing m chemicals. 

After the actual spraying procedure 
is done {which takes about 60 seconds), 
you put on your robe and head back to 
your dressing room to towel off. You 
want to make sure you buff off your 
entire body, with special care given to 
your arms and face. Not only are you 
spreading the tan around, you are also 
removing excess solution. You then put 
your clothes back 
on, and 





takes 

a few 
hours to really 
set in. but you will notice instant results. 
A handy way to tell how dark you 
become is pulling a sticker on your arm, 
provided by both salons, and then peel- 
ing it off after the procedure. It will look 
like a nifty little tattoo. Much to my 
delight, this solution did not turn me 
orange! Although it is not one hundred 
percent authentic looking, it is a very 
good imitation of actual sun-tanning. 
My face, chest, and arms (what the 
heck — everywhere) are a very healthy 
radiant bronze. 

Now, I'll gel down to the nitly-grit- 
ty and get into the specifics of each 



place. My first port of call was Mist n' 
Go Tan, run by Stacey Hernandez. She is 

very knowledgeable about her machine, 
and sports a healthy looking tan herself. 
She told me that she has the procedure 
done twice a week. Her salon sports a 
very classy marbleized look, and is very 
new looking. I under^vent the procedure 
there, and was impressed by the results. 
She gave me e.xcellent customer service, 
and seemed to be able to answer every 
question that came her way, .Ahead of 
me in line were two ladies who seemed 
rather nervous. Hernandez was more 
than happy to hold their hands through 
the whole process (well, not hterally... 
that could get somewhat messy). I had a 
ver\- pleasant experience overall, although 
she didn't offer to give me any touch-up 
work that may have been needed. 

The next day, I set out to review Sun 
Mist Tan, I realized that because I was 
already tanned, I couldn't give it 
a fair review if I had the 
procedure done 
again. I dragged a 
colleague and 
good fnend of 
mine, Brandon 
Schwarze 
(Curtain Call 
writer) along 
with me. He has 
been guilty of using 
self-tanning lotion in the 
past, and turning out slightly orange. I 
thought he may benefit from the experi- 
ence. I called ahead and talked to Rulhie 
Barth, the general manager of Sun Mist 
Tan, She answered some questions for 
me, and was, like Hernandez, friendly 
and very knowledgeable. 

When Brandon and I walked 
through the door, we were greeted by 
the two charming employees. Crystal 
and Crystal (who also happen to be 
IPI^W students). Sun Mist Tan, having 
been in business longer and having 
developed a larger clientele base, was 
larger and more salon-like. There were 
bottles of lotions to help maintain your 
tan and magazines by the chairs in the 
reception area. 

There was, however, a distinct odor 
of the tanning solution in the air that 
was not detected at Mist n' Go. The tivo 
employees guided Brandon through the 
procedure, which was almost identical 
to the tour 1 got at Mist n' Go. After he 
was sprayed, toweled and dressed, he 
joined us in the reception area. One of 
the girls noticed that his hands were a 
bit too dark, and immediately took him 
lo a sink and used a loofah and lava 
soap lo make his hands more natural 
looking, A definite plus of Sun Mist Tan 
was the display of lotions and touch-up 
spray for sale. 

As an interesting side note. Sun Mist 
Tan is owned by Dr. Jim Lentz, of Fort 



'fefffcf 



Wayne Dermatology. He is a licensed 
dermatologist, and stands fully behind 
this UV-free, wrinkle-free, cancer-free 
method of tanning, 

Now the bad news — the price. For a 
single session, both salons charge S15. 
This isn't bad, considering the quahty of 
the tan, but once you hear that the tan 
only lasts a little over a week, it could 
gel a bit pricey lo maintain. You do 
receive a discount from both places 
when purchasing multiple sessions, (S28 
for tivo sessions at Mist n' Go, and 
S24.95 for two at Sun Mist; both places 
offer 10 sessions for SlOO) and at both 
places, you receive a significant dis- 
count when you present your student 
ID. 

Overall, if you are buying more than 

one session, Sun Mist Tan seems to run 

cheaper in price. Mist n' Go does have a 

referral program, however For every 

five people you recommend, you 

receive a free session. 

If you are planning 
on maintaining your 
tan throughout the 
year, it has been rec- 
ommended that you 
have two sessions in 
the hrst week, and 
then once a week after 
that. 
After a few days have 
past, my tan is still very natural. 
The first lime I showered, I noticed a lit- 
tle bit of brorvze going doivn the drain, 
but nothing significant. Another strange 
thing about this solution on my skin is 
thai it smells slightly furuiy for a while. 
It definitely has a salty aroma. After a 
few showers, Ihe smell fades out. 

Bottom line: If you need a quick, 
natural looking tan and don't want to 
sizzle underneath a tanning bed, get a 
mist-on tan. However, if you want to 
maintain it for as long as a tan that you 
would receive from Mr. Sun himself or 
from a tanning bed, mist-on tanning 
would be rather expensive. You have 
two locations on either side of town to 
choose from and friendly, knowledge- 
able people at each. You can contact Sun 
Mist Tan at 432-8848, and Mist n' Go, 
Inc. at 480-7809. 

So the best thing 1 can tell you is lo 
try it for yourself It is an excellent way 
to impress people when they ask, "So 
where did YOU go for spring break?" 
All you have lo do is put a smug smile 
on your face, roll up your sleeves and 
bare your arms. They can make their 
conclusion for themselves. 

Dam, that won't work for me, see- 
ing as how I just advertised the fact that 
I went to a salon. I still think I may feel 
uncomfortable unclothing myself in a 
strange place, but I do know that when ! 
need a tan again, mist-on tanning is Ihe 
way I will be heading.
