SelectiveSer vice Clarifies Changes 



The Selective Service "Sys- 
tem has clarified expected 
policy changes on underprsd- 
uate student deferments. 

Collep-e students who were 
enrolled full-time in the 
1^70-71 academic year will be 
elipible for student defer- 
ments in the 1971-72 school 
year if they continue to 
make satisfactory progress 
in their programs of study, 
Selective Service officials 
said. 

Young men who entered 
school for the first time 
this summer and those who 
enroll as freshmen this fall 
will not cualify for student 
deferments if the rjendinF 
changes to the Selective Ser- 
vice Act are passed by Con- 
gress. The House has com- 
pleted action on the bill 
^ind final Senate action is 



expected in September. 

'Dr. Curtis W. Tarr, Se- 
lective Service Director, 
said: "Few incoming fresh- 
men students are likely to 
be inducted in the near fu- 
ture because of the student 
deferment phaseout. Of the 
1,054,000 incoming freshmen 
males estimated by the Of- 
fice of Education, approx- 
imately 80% are 18 years old 
and only 205*0 are 19 years 
of age or older." He also 
said that the 18 year olds 
will receive their lottery 
nun;bers in J'^'?^, and they 
will not be sub,ject to in- 
duction until 1975 1 when 
draft calls should be low. 
The 19 year old freshmen re- 
ceived their lottery num.bers 
Aug. 5** of this year and 
will be sub.ject to induction 
next year; at least half

Free Parkers Receive Tickets 



On Friday beptember 10, 
the free lot parkers learn- 
ed that parkinp- was no le- 
er free unless they were 
parked in the lot rroper. 
City Toljce issued an estim- 
ated ICO ticketr to c=rs il- 
l-^gslly parked alonr the 
-road leadinr from By-Dass ^f.- 
to the fre° lot. When fups- 



tioned, the police pointed out 
that the property that peonle 
have been improperly narking 
on belongs to the city, is 
clearly posted, and therefore 
they had no alternative but 
to ticket all the violators. 

Please see cap on page four 
concerning improper parking on 
the free lot. 



should have high enough lot- 
tery numbers to preclude 
their induction. Of those 
remaining, approximately ^0% 
will be disqualified on men- 
tal, moral or physical grounds. 

A maximum of 50,000 men 
will be directly affected in 
1972 by the student defer- 
ment phaseout and one-half 
of these, or 25,000, will 
probably not be inducted be- 
cause of enlistments in Reg- 
ular, Reserve or National 
Guard units, participating 
in commissioninfT programs or 
because of procedural delays. 
College students will not 
be drafted in the middle cf 
a semester or term. If call- 
ed while enrolled, they will 
be allowed to postpone their 
induction until the end of 
the semester, or term. If In 
their last academic year, 
they will be able to' post- 
i pone their induction until 
after rr.^duation. 

Incoming freshmen and stu- 
dents who started their pro- 
gram of study in the snmiiier 
of 1071 or later were advised 
not to file applications for 
student deferments even 
tnourh the current law author- 
, izes granting deferment? to 
students in full-time programs 
of study ^ 

"If the pending Selective 
Service legislation does not 
pass," Tarr said, "it would 
not be in a registrant's best 
interest to obtain a student 
deferment which would extend 
his liability until age ^5. 
Should Congress change the 
legislation to provide for 
deferments for new incoming 
freshmen, which is most un- 
likely, applications for de- 
ferments will not be jeopard- 
ized by delaying their sub- 
mission until after passage 
of the new law. "

Student comment 



Superstar^ an emotional thing 



By Steve Porter 

Anyone concerned with the 
spiritual world or even the 
atheist or apnostic, walked 
away (some stiffly) from 
"Superstar" with an optimis- 
tic view of our convocations 
program this year. To those 
of you fundamentally involv- 
ed in religion, "Superstar" 
might have offended you, as 
it is a new concept in the 
portrayal of Jesus Christ 
and new concepts in religion. 
are usually looked uyjon with 
great scepticism, if not 
scorn. 

But even you Birchers, 
who v/ere probably emotionally 
involved in the rock-opera, 
jiust admit the whole show had 
a good beat. 

In fact, as I talked to a 
character clutching a micro- 
phone in the lobby, I dis- 
covered that not a single 
person uttered an obscenity 
into his little green black- 
mail machine. Perhaps it is 
possible to move people spir- 
itually without scaring the 
hell out of them. 

This somewhat sensitive 
question mipht have arisen in 
your minds had you dwelled on 
"Superstar" after curtains: 
"Could I actually relate to 
a -black r.erson as Jesus 
Christ?" 




HE DID HOl ^10 A COMMITTEE 





From New Nexico 
to Scott Gillie 
to us, to you 



Since the majority of the 
I. U. -Purdue student body are 
derivitives of that ungodly 
glob referred to as middle 
class, we were all brought 
up with the impression that 
J.C. looked like the cat on 
our Sunday School calendar. 

There just aren't many 
oils floating around with 
J.C. portrayed as a Soul 
■Brother. (Although it does 
make sense now that 1 gaze 
at the term) . 

Flashing back to the show, 
it can be generalized that 
Billy Barnes did a superb 
job in his role and regard- 
less of middle-class hang- 
ups, Georfe C. Scott couldn't 
have done better. (But I 
think Barnes could have 
swung "Patton" '.) 

The whole cast did a splen- 
did job, and I'm not sure we 
could have promrted them to 
do better (even if some of 
you would have used both 
hcuids when you clapped) . 

I was elated to find that 
the crovid finally responded 
with a standing ovation, 
even if your ulterior motive 
was cretting blood to your 
feet.

Defining Student Gov't 



To those of us who are 
new to the Indiana-Purdue 
Regional Campus, and perhaps 
many who aren't, the term 
"Student Government" re- 
mains at best, nothing more 
than a va^ue committee with 
an even more vague purpose. 
A closer look, however, re- 
veals that Student Govern- 
ment is a miniture facsimile 
of our federal government. 

In essence, student gov- 
ernment is an effective 
bridp:e sjranning the communi- 
cations canyon between the 
adjninistration and the fstu-i 
dent body. Like the federal 
government , the student 
government is divided into 
the three branches; execu- 
tive, legislative, and judi- 
cial. 

Also under the wing of the 
Judicial Branch is the Cam- 
pus Appeals Board, consist- 
ing of four representatives 
and their alternates. Be- 
cause there are so many 
positions in the Student 
Government, a description 
of each one would be too 
lengthy; therefore, it 
would be more practical to 
discuss only the most im- 
portant job in each depart- 
ment. 

Each department is head- 
ed by a secretary who is 
responsible directly to 
Student Body President, Mark 
Franke, for the satisfactory 
performance of the activi- 
ties of his department. The 
secretaries are members of 
the President's Cabinet. 

Mike Pfundstein, Secre- 
tary of State, is responsi- 
ble for all relations and 
communications of his de- 
partment. He supervises fun- 
ctions assigned to his de- 
partment , submits written 
reports to the president 
upon request, and receives 
periodic reports from mem- 
bers of his department. 

Steve Evans, Secretary of 
the Interior, has the respon- 
sibility of assuring that 
all activities in his de- 
partment are carried out in 
an efficient manner. The 
interior department is re- 







sponsible for relations with 
the administration, faculty, 
students, governing boards, 
and all other clubs of the 
Indiana-Purdue University 
at Fort Wayne. Steve also 
rnast, upon request, submit 
reports to the president, as 
well as receive reports from 
each of the members of the 
Interior Department. 

Dave James, Secretary of . 
bhe Treasury, must keep 
close account of the budget 
allocation to the Excutive 
Branch of student government 
of our Fort Wayne Campus. 
He must also assure that 
the gears of the Treasury 
Department are will oiled 
and assume responsibility 
for all functions assigned 
to that department. Dave 
keeps the president inform- 
ed on the budget with period- 
ic reports with the addition- 
al assistance of the Under- 
secretary of the Treasury, 
Gary Gerbers. 

As head of the Department 
of Justice, Attorney General 
Phil Gag-le is the Tighter of 
wrongs, whose job it is to 
protect and defend the rights 
of all students of IndiEina- 
Purciue University Fort Wayne 
Campus. He has the added 
responsibility of represent- 
inF the Students ' Government 
in all court cases. He as- 
sures that all Student Gov- 
ernment decisions (senate 
legislation or executive or- 
ders) are enforced. Upon 
the request of the president, 
he shall submit a written 
report to him concerning the 
cctivities of his area of 
jurisdiction. 

The fourteen senators and 
the vice-president of the 
student body make up the leg- 
islative branch. Some of 
their more important duties 
include approving the consti- 
tution of any new club or or- 
gianization, recoran. ending ap- 
proval of the budgets of 
standing organizations and 
activities, serving as a 
liaison between the adminis- 
tration and the student body, 
and recommending rules per- 
taining to student behavior.

SUPERSTAR - BILIY BARNES 




.RBES 

Superstar - more than a musical 



SUIEhGTAK 0.-67 AT RAP SESSION 



Superstar was more than 
Just a few-hour inusical per- 
formance. For the members 
of the Convocation Commit- 
tee ^ it involved several 
months of work, with a few 
solid doses of panic mixed 



Cast meets with 
lU-PU students 



Four members of the Super- 
star cast met with Indiana- 
Purdue students early Tuesday 
afternoon for an informal rap 
seaeion in the student lounge. 

Jeff Gibson and music in- 
structor Andrew Harper con- 
ducted the meeting- until cast 
members arilved shortly be- 
fore 1 p.m. Professor Harper 
presented the musical aspects 
of what he called the "rock- 
passion auditorial." Describ- 
ing; the music of the production 
he said, "It sounds like 19^5 
Gene Autry, with soul." 

Gibson discussed the theo- 
lopy of Superstar. He said 
that it is an examination of 
the traditional belief of 
Christ with the conclusion 
that Jesus was just an ex- 
traordinary man. 

The four cast members, 
two of whom played the parts 
of Caiphias, and Pontius 
Pilate, plus the organist and 
opening singer, suggested that 
people "go to see it (Super- 
star) as entertainment." In 
this way they felt everyone 
would come out pleased and 
retaining the belief that 
they had before coming to the 
production. 

On hand for the rap ses- 
sion were reporters from 
Port Wayne newspapers, along 
with WAWE-TV and their tele- 
vision camera. 

A sellout crowd, mostly 
Indiana-Purdue students , at- 
tended Superstar Tuesday 
night at the Scottish Rate 
Auditoruim. 

September 17, 1971 



The proposal for Super- 
star was developed by Con- 
vo in June. Through early 
July, Convocation members, 
with the assistance of 
Student Body President 
Kirk Franke, pushed for a 
supplemental Student Sen- 
ate allocation of Super- 
star could be contracted. 
Once this was obtained, 
the period of early plan- 
ning began and efforts 
were made to nail down an 
elusive contract. 

The contract was elu- 
sive because of court 
problems. Our Superstar 
was being hassled about 
copyright laws. After 
several months of rest- 
less waiting and despite 
numerous discussions of 
dropping the entire pro- 
gram, the contract fin- 
ally came through. How- 
ever, one week before 
showtime, a letter came 
to the Ccottish Rite 
threatening a lawsuit, 

Thursday ticket sales 
were frozen while uni- 
versity lawyers debated 
the seriousness of the 
threat. The lawyers 
gambled and sided with 
the students ' interest 
and ticket sales re- 
opened. 

The end result was 
possibly Indiana-Pur- 
due's most successful pro- 
gram. Every one of the 
2197 tickets was sold . 
About 1600 students, 40% 
of the full time students, 
picked up tickets. 

Most of the shows' de- 
tails were handled by 
students, rather than 'ad- 
ministrators. The hand- 



ling of the cnst on Tues- 
day was done by using the 
student government office 
as a communications cen- 
ter. Whenever Convo mem- 
bers arrived at specific 
scheduled points, such as 
at VGL, the airport or the 
rap session, they called in. 
This helped smooth such 
problems as part of the cast 
getting delayed arriving in 
New York and consequently a 
late flight. 

Sharon Gabet was in charge 
of the Superstar program. 
All involved credited her 
with an outstanding perfor- 
mance. John Mann, student 
government press officer, 
spent many hours handling 
publicity. Other Convo 
members, John Allevozt, 
Stan Jones, Dr. Kenworthy, 
and Dean Lantz, gave their 
all, Mike Pfundstein and 
John Perkins also assisted 
at crucial times during 
Tuesday's schedule. Others 
who contributed their time 
were the beleaguered ush- 
ers - Steve Bollier, Randy 
Kipper, Steve Cowan, Gary 
Brown, Randy Bums, Dale 
Komanec, Jim Snelling, Dap- 
rell Pamin, Jones, Per- 
kins, and Pfundstein,

Humanistic vs. technological 



Folk School uses new approach 



Terrj Doran. founder of 
the Fort Wayne Folk Scnool 
feels that in an era of rapid 
techno] ocical chanpe there 
shoiild ^e more than one way 
to i^&amp;t ar education. "The 
current educational system 
i.?'a virtu;;! monopoly," 
Terry said, "and a monopoly 
even vlien c;ood is n.ucli +00 
r-^stricLiva. '' 

As er alternative. Terry 
hn? founder! the Fort 'vsyne 
Folk tchoo] whicn will 'be 
teachinF a wioe variety of 
coursf s. The teacher? ranre 
from college 1 rofessors to 
individu-JlE with special 
ski '&lt; 1 s anii fne ''.esire to 
teach. &amp;v,tjpctp ranp-e fro'Ji 
Arts and Crafts to WorV-shop 
for Women. The main thrust 
of the school is, as Terry 
says, "to provide educat'.or 
v;hich maxirizes human learn- 
ing potential . " 

'He continued to comment, 
"Althouph no system can pos- 
sibly be flexible enough to 
meet the needs of every indi- 
vidual in the folk school, we 
strive to meet his needs by 
being- solely accountable to 
him, the student. Each per- 
son comes voluntarily, and if 



we aren't satisfying him he 
is free to leave as easily as 
he came. In short, we are 
accountable not to public vote 
or even citizen support, but 
to our clientels — the people 
we serve." 

More money is beinp made 
available for education, and 
the choice becomes one of 
buyinp more of the same, or 
providing new alternatives, 
■"^e Fort Wayne Folk School 
proposes tc provide a new 
alternative. 

Just as legal stipulations 
are beinc^ met, so too are ed- 
ucational requirements being 
satisfied. G&amp;D tests are 
available to certify comple- 
tion of high school require- 
ments, and some coHepes 
have agreed to accept stu- 
dents on the basis of indivi- 
dual consideration. The 
quality of education is ex- 
pected to be very high, as 
the school intends to culti- 
vate a student's curiosity 
rather than to stultify it 
into lethargic conformity. 
This will hopefully m.otivate 
a student to seek out ans- 
wers of his ov/n volition, ana 
make learning a 24 liour a

alienated, it should be point- 
ed out that (II G.K, is much 
better on records than they 
are live, and (2) Pure Funk 
is very, very good live.) 

Ture Funk's version of 
Johnny Winter's "Johnny B. 
Goode" by itself would make 
them worth seeing, but add 
some Food original stuff, a 
rock version of the Tempta- 
tion's "Cloud Nine" with fan- 
tastic harmony and some me- 
morsble .oldies it adds up to 
an interesting three-hour 
show. 

The only member of the 
p-roup who didn't, come off as 
exceptional was the ?00- 
pound fuzzy-haired lead sinc- 
er. However, after he sang 
Joe Cocker's "The Letter" as 
well as Cocker himself, he 
was forgiven for being flat 
on other soup-s. (And he did 
do a mean "Monster Mash.") 

A word that kept cominc^ 
to my mind F-riday ni-ht was 
"ultimate." "Ultimate" local 
bank, "ultimate"" rock'n'roll, 
"ultimate" lead player, "ul- 
timate" gross. 

unfortunately, there is no 
rock group in Fort Wa; .-^e to 
follow an act like Pure Funk. 
The average audience doesn't 
come to hear the "live 4S" 
but neither do they want to 
hear some local band on an 
ego trip do all their own 
songs. There must be a hap- 
py medium. Pure Funk was 
ver.y close to it.

Guess what I didl I snuck 
into the rehearsal of one of 
the most exciting shows I 
have ever seen: You're a 
Good Man Charlie Brown . 
Charlie Brown and his friends 
have enchanted millions of 
readers for majiy years, and 
PIT'S production seems to 
have captured the wholesome 
goodness,- the subtle humor, 
and the profound wisdom of 
the Peanuts gajig. Through 
a lot of backstage running 
and skillful blackouts, the 
play manages to become the 
Peanuts neighborhood, complete 
with Charlie and all his 
friends. 

Charlie (Dale Mcintosh), 
as always, is pirappling with 
life and death issues which 
have him in their power, while 
Linus sees the sajne issues 
and cheerfully puts them in 
puts them in their proper 
place. 

At one point, Charlie is 
trying to define the awesome 
relevance of a newspaper, 
while Linus listens attentively. 
As Charlie finishes his dis- 
ertation, Linus pulls his 
thumb out of his mouth and 
declares, "The reason I like 
a newspaper is that you don't

have to dial it." 

Lucy (Julia Bucheit) is 
there, too, busy with her 
two main poals in life — 
freeing Linus from his 
blanket, and freeing 
Schroeder from both his piano 
and his bachelorhood — making 
equally dismal progress wrth 
both goals, 

Patty (Pat Fisher) ; .13 hns 
a problem. She loves a dne. 
The dog she loves is, of 
course, Snoopy (Larry Life), 
In one scene, as Patty comes 
into view, she sees Snoopy 
and runs up to give him a 
great big hug. Not satisfied, 
and much to Snoopy's delight, 
she decides to give him a great 
big kiss as well. However, on 
viewing Snoopy's pucker, Patty 
decides she would rather not, 
and runs off leavinp a mournful 
Snoopy to lament "the curse of 
a fugzy face." 

The players have a success on 
their hands and they can feel it; 
they are excited about the play, 
and they radiate this feeling; 
they are having fun getting it 
together smd are anxious to 
perform it. I, for one, am 
very anxious to see it. PEACE.
