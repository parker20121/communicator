Wallace attends senate meeting 

Chancellor addresses concerns 



BY DAVID N. BENSON 
News Editor 

Chancellor Tom Wallace was the 
special guest at the Feb. 10 student 
senate meeting. 

Wallace last visited the body at the 
Sept, 2 meeting to defend his smoking 
policy. The topic surfaced when Kim 
Teier, student senator, asked Wallace 
how the policy was working Wallace 



responded that an industrial hygiene 
organization was studying the 
question. 

Although he had not yet seen the 
report, Wallace said it was clear to 
him that the ventilation in the Class- 
room Medical Building was faulty. 
Wallace said although complaints 
have been received, many people have 
said much less smoking occurs on 



campus. 

Jeff Pieper asked whether slate law 
mandated separate areas for smokers 
and non-smokers. Wallace said 
IPFW's smoking policy was stricter 
than the state law. "We can't find 
another campus in the state with a 
stricter smoking policy," Wallace 
said, "We've been held up as being in 
the forefront " 



It'll be a cold day.

-baha buggy 
around a grueling track— what could 
be more fun? One might prefer flying 
a self-designed and hand-built model 
cargo plane in a national competition. 
Is entering a supermileage car or 
midget Formula racer more enjoy- 
able? Student members of the Society 
of Automotive Engineers are en- 
couraged to participate in such 
exciting events. 

William Coleman, international 
president of SAE, was in Fort Wayne 
Wednesday, Feb. 10, lo meet with 
local members and leaders Coleman 
was in town to speak to local industry 
SAE chapter members and to promote 
Ihe activities of IPFW's student 
chapter, Coleman is general manager 
of Eaton Corporation and wilt serve as 
president of SAE for one year. 

The SAE is devoted not only lo 
automobile engineering but to mobiltly 
engineering in general. Orville Wright 
and Charles Lindbergh were both past 
members of SAE. 

Student membership is very at- 
tractive on a resume, said Coleman, 
The challenge of design competitions 
gives the student a real-world per- 
spective. He must deal with suppliers. 
meet deadlines, account for expenses 
and function well in a machine shop. 

Prospective employers are inter- 
ested in Ihose students who can make 
the transition from college life to 
industry most efficiently. 

Mini-baha events, held in three 
regions across the United States. 
boasted l.SOO participanU in last 
year'scompetitions. 

Using an unmodified eight- 
horsepower engine, designers must 
consider styling, safety, comfort, and 
cost— the buggy must be constructed 
for under $2,000. The vehicle must 
pass static judging to qualify for Ihe 
endurance race The endurance 
course, bearing a resemblance to a 
dirt-bike track, allows the designers lo 
personally lest their creations, 
IPFW's student chapter has competed 
yearly in Ihis event. 



The local SAE chapter is credited 
with starting a competition now offer- 
ing over SI, 000 in total prize money for 
the winners. The student must fit a 
model car with a drive mechanism 
powered by a clock spring. 

In addition to the design contests, 
the inlernational SAE sponsors a stu- 
dent l&gt;oolh competition at the annual 
International Congress and Exposition 
and publishes a graduate engineers' 
bulletin biannually in which students 
advertise their availability to 
prospective employers. 

The IPFW student chapter, advised 
by Donald McAleece, professor of 



manufacturing technology, formed in 
1971. From 1974 through 1977, IPFW's 
chapter was the largest branch in 
North America. The local industry 
chapter of the SAE supports activities 
on Ihe campus and offers students 
sources for design help and working 
capital 

McAleece said women are en- 
couraged to join SAE. Almost 40 per- 
cent of the students meeting with 
Coleman arc women. Interested stu- 
dents are invited to the next meeting 
for the IPFW student chapter of SAE 
on Wednesday. March 9, at Goeglein's 
Reserve. 



Enforcement also was an issue. 
Teler said one of her professors 
smoked during class. 

Wallace responded, "Part of what 
we are trying to do here is discipline 
ourselves. Instead of handing out 
tickets, we hope we can setf-police it. 
If it bothers you. you should tell him 
he shouldn't smoke," 

Teler said. "We were talking about 
it in class one day-he got irate when 
asked lo slop smoking, so 1 don't think 
I'm going lo ask him to stop 
smoking," 

Wallace replied, "1 think you 
answered your own question." 

The search for a vice chancellor of 
student affairs came up, Wallace said 
he wanted someone who could handle 
both enrollment management and 
student services. 

"In my last job we had three deans 
dealing with these kinds of things. It 
was hard to pinpoint who was re- 
sponsible tor what. We want someone 
who can make sure all the pieces go 
together in a continuum," Wallace 

Phil Downs, vice president of Stu- 
dents' Government, asked what effect 
the current restructuring of student 
services would have on the incoming . 
vice chancellor, 

Wallace said nothing had been pre- 
set. "What I have proposed and what 
has come out of strategic planning are 
ideas and concepts. I have prefer- 
ences, but nothing is set in concrete. 
The candidates have been giving us 
some interesting ideas, I would expect 
the successful candidate would put 
together a committee of facully and 
students and make some proposals." 

Wallace also addressed the color 
issue, "I think you all should declare 
victory and go on " Wallace said. "All 
of us make recommendations There 
IS always someone at the next higher 
level. Even ( Purdue i President 
(Steveni Beering makes recommend- 
ations to the board and the board 
makes recommendations lo God. The 
important thing is that you all got 
involved and you got pari of what you 
wanted, i don't think you should feel 
put down." 

Wallace also responded to an edi- 
torial in The Communicator. The edi- 
torial stated that campus beautifl- 
cation might increase tuition. "Those 
kinds of projects are funded through 
special appropriations and gifts. The 
only way it remotely affects tuition 
would t&gt;e if it increased the cost of 
campus maintenance a great deal. I 
don't see that happening," Wallace 
said. 



Art and the Appreciations 

Concert features IPFW 



1- 



BY RICHARD E. JOHNSON 
Features Editor 

The Tri-State Folk Music Society 
presented an informal concert in 
Room 224 of Walb Memorial Union 
last Sunday. The concert, billed as a 
folk-rock/folk-music performance, 
was introduced as a collection of love 
songs. 

The group of six performers, called 
'"Art and the Appreciations", has ex- 
isted "in various incarnations for 
about Ihree years," said group 
member Gregg Coffey, associate 
faculty member of fine arts. Coffey 
described the band as usually playing 
"polkadelic" music. 

Coffey plays guitar and flule with 
the non-profit group, John Brennan, 
associate professor of Enghsh and 
linguistics, plays the mandolin and 
sings, Bob Phillips plays bass guitar, 
Bob Savage plays cello. Art Cislo 
plays keyboard and accordion, and 
Rebecca Coffey sings the majority of 
the selections. 

The standing-room-only audience 
was comprised of about seventy peo- 
ple, ranging from three lo 60 years 
old. 

"Art and the Appreciations" will be 
performing "Polkadelic" selections 
during the St Patrick's Day festivities 
at St. Mary's Church in downtown 
Fort Wayne.

IPFW invisible to public 



When Tom Ehrlich, president of 
Indiana University, was last in 
Fort Wayne, he said he worried 
about IPFW's visibility in the 
community. The validity of 
Ehrlich's observation surfaced on 
Feb, 6 when the News-Sentinel 
pulilished a list of what it con- 
sidered to be 25 of Fort Wayne's 
best features. 

IPFW did not make that list. 

The same story also listed 25 of 
what it considered to be the most 
annoying things in Fort Wayne. In 
that list appeared "Bypass 0," the 
university that has parking lots in- 
stead of fraternity houses. 

The following week, Judy Clinton, 
IPFW's executive director of uni- 
versitv relations, wrote a letter to 
the eiJitor asking the News-Sentinel 
to consider what Fort Wayne would 



be like without IPFW. 

Clinton highlighted IPFW's con- 
tributions to Fort Wayne's cultural 
life and detailed how IPFW brings 
two big ten universities to people 
who cannot leave home to acquire 
a degree. 

Clinton's letter was masterfully 
composed, and she deserves praise 
for having written it. 

But consider the News-Sentinel. 
It sends reporters to cover all im- 
portant IPFW events. If "Bypass 
U" is the opinion of those who pay 
attention to IPFW, imagine the 
opinion of people who don't pav at- 
tention to IPFW, The real message 
in the News-Sentinel's feature is 
that no matter how hard we try, we 
are always going to be known as 
• 'Bypass U . Ehrlich is right ; 
IPFW is invisible. 



Power struggle vexing 



Two things would improve rela- 
tions between Students' Govern- 
ment and the administration that 
governs over it— communication 
and cooperation. 

Communication— between Stu- 
dents' Government and the admin- 
istrations of Indiana and Purdue 
Universities— would prevent 
Purdue President Steven Beering 
or IPFW chancellor Thomas 
Wallace suddenly objecting to a 
motion that was discussed weeks 
earlier. 

Cooperation— between Students' 
Government and the administra- 
tion, via proper channels and, more 
importantly, through major gov- 
ernmental agreements— should ex- 
ist. How much influence should a 



Students' Government resolution 
have? Intuition tells us that student 
representatives should have the 
last word in what happens to the 
student body. This is simple de- 
mocracy. And, logically, the ad- 
ministration should also have a 
say. 

Should administrators have 
complete control? More than 25 
student representatives spend their 
valuable time making decisions 
that can be rendered null and void 
at effortlessly as playing a game of 
"Win, Lose or Draw." 

Do students have any real 
power? Students' Government says 
yes: the administration says not 
really.

Letters to the Editor- 



Expensive service 

To the Editor: 

I would like to take issue 
with two comments at- 
tributed to Professor Art 
Finco in an article concern- 
ing the parking problem at 
IPFW. 

First, he Is quoted as 
saying, in regard to the 
rejection of a proposal that 
A parking spaces be made 
AB spaces after a certain 
hour, "Rank has its 
privileges." 

,The underlying assump- 
tWtf ^n this statement, 
which 1 have found ex- 
tremely offensive during 
my years a( this campus, is 
that students are the lowest 
form of human life, and to 
repeat an often overheard 
phrase, "This university 
wouldn't be such a bad 
place without them." 

This attitude ignores the 
fact that as students, we 
are the consumers of 3 
rather expensive service 
—the provision of which is 
the very purpose of this 



university's existence— and. 
as such, are the customers 
who are traditionally as- 
sumed to be always right. 

Second, in response to 
Gregory's rather arrogant 
suggestion that if rank has 
such privileges student 
senators and SAB members 
should be allowed to use A 
parking. Professor Finco is 
quoted as saying, "Gregory 
will understand this (the 
denial of such privilege) 
when he gets a little older," 

1 do not know how long 
Professor Finco has known - 
our illustrious student body 
president or how long he 
has followed Gregory's ca- 
reer, but I have known 
Gregory and watched his 
evolution long enough to 
seriously question whether 
age, or any other experi- 
ence or condition, will pro- 
vide enlightenment to a 
young man whose ego is 
substantially larger than his 
brain. 

I would like to remind 
Mr. Gregory as well as 



Professor Finco that their 
positions at IPFW make 
them servants of the stu- 
dents and not their masters, 
Kathleen Richards 

Gregory rebukes 

To (he Editor : 

1 would like to respond to 
Dr. Finco's inane remark 
highlighted in the "Quote of 
the Week" section of last 
week's Communicator. As 
H. L, Meneken said in 
Prejudices; Third Scries, 
"The older I grow, the more 
I distnist the familiar doc- 
trine that age brings 
wisdom." 

Kurl H. Gregory 
student body president 

Spirit made known 

To the Editor: 

In an attempt to spark 
campus interest, the IPFW 
music department was 
asked to organize a pep 
band to play at all home 



basketball games. So Ear 
(he band has played at four 
games and has gotten some 
verbal praise. However, 
organizing any kind of 
group involves a lot of 
work. David Moore and 
Tori Hoover, the directors 
of the group, have been do- 
ing a lot of behind-the- 
scenes work in order to 
present a positive image of 
the newly-formed pep band. 
Within the next few weeks. 



the band will have a uni- 
form and a theme song. 

I think it's great that 
there is an organization 
willing to help out the uni- 
versity, as well as the bas- 
ketball team. Too many 
people don't realize there is 
some school spirit at IPFW. 
Ask the athletes and the 
student organizations, and 
ask the pep band!

Golsteyn. a six-foot- four- 
inch junior who plays both 
middle and outside hitter, 
set school records last 
season with 573 kills and 228 
digs. He also had team 
highs in block assists I'l2i 
and hitting percentage 
(.299). 

Despite last season's 
achievements, his goal for 
(his season is to simply do 
be((er. 

"I want to beat my own 
records, which will be (ough 
because everyone will be 
keying on me," said 
Golsteyn. 

A West AUis, Wisconsin 
native, Golsteyn didn't t&gt;e- 
eome interested in volley- 



ball until high school when 
3 friend recommended the 
sport to him. 

In 1984. while playing in 
(he Junior Olympics in 
Chicago, Volleydon coach 
Arnje Ball spotted Golsteyn 
and was impressed. He then 
offered Golsteyn a scholar- 
ship, which Golsteyn 
accepted. 

In 1986. as the starting 
middle hitter for (he North 
squad, he led his team to 
the silver medal at the 
Olympic Festival in 
Houston 

"It was the best experi- 
ence of my life," Golsteyn 
said, "The talent was ex- 
cellent. It was a great 
learning experience, I got to 
see what I could do." 

"He's not so much a vocal 
leader as much as he's a 
player-leader. He leads with 
his abilities and attitudes on 
the floor," said Ball, 

"He consistently makes 
the big plays. He's a leader 
on the floor. He's con- 
sistenlly our best passer, 
our best blocker and our 
best hitter." Ball said. 

Alter college. Golsteyn, a 
civil engineering major, 
hopes to play in the 1989 
World University Games, 
"Making the team will l&gt;e a 
stepping slone toward mak- 
ing the national team." he 
said. 

If Golsteyn fails to qualify 
for the American nationals, 
he is considering playing 
professional volleyball 
overseas. Former Volleydon 
star Loren Gerlwrt plays m 
the European professional 
league for a team in 



Carpenepolo, Italy Gol- 
steyn docs not rule oul the 
possibility of following his 
ex-teammate's fools(eps. 

'■He has goals set for 
himself and is willing to 
make sacrifices to reach his 
goals," commented Ball on 
his young star. 

For now, Golsteyn will 
concentrate on the final 
four. He should become 
IPFWs all-time leader in 
kills, digs and blocks by the 
end of his career. If he con- 
tinues at his present rate. 
Golsteyn will need a mere 
46 kills his senior year to 
shaHer the career record 
held by '87 graduate Ted 
Owen. 

The answer is: The IPFW 
volleyball player who holds 
school season records for 
kills, digs, assists and 
should own the career re- 
cord within a year. Who is 
Joy Golsteyn'' Correct!

The Lady 'Dqns fell to the 
Lady Flyers of Lewis Uni- 
versity 91-81 at the IPFW 
Athletic Center last 

Thursday. 

The Lady 'Dons led 44-39 
at the half, with a high 
percentage of compleled 



shots. The Lady Flyers re- 
turned after the half with a 
much improved shooting 
average and defense. The 
free-throw opportunities 
lipped the scale in favor of 
Lewis as the Flyers 
dropped in 29 of 42 com-

The frustration con- 
tinues. The IPFW Volley- 
dons dropped their twenty- 
second straight match to 
their Indiana rivals. Ball 
Stale, Tuesday. Feb. 9, on 
(he Cardinals' home court. 
IPFW has never beaten

score. The Cardinals put 
the match away, winning 
the next two games 15-6 
and 15-11, 

"We did a nice job on 
side ouls. but we didn't 
work the transition vgry 
well," said coach Arnie 



Ball. "We didn't score in 
some key situations and 
we didn't take advantage 
of free balls," added the 
coach. 

"Overall it was a good 
match, and if we play 
better and with more con- 
sistency, we can beat 
them (Ball State)," said 
Ball, 

Individual stars in the 
Ball State match were 
junior outside hitter Jay 
Golsteyn, junior middle 
hitter Bob Kramer and 
sophomore middle hitter 
Fred Malcom, Kramer led 
the 'Dons with four blocks 
and 13 digs. Golsteyn 
topped the team with 36 
kills, and Malcom scored 
two aces while serving.

IS prcscnling its latest pro- 
ditclion ■■Aluminum Par- 
adise. " beginning Feb 19 at 
8 p.m Tlio play was written 
and directed by Joel

of thc.ilre

"Aluniinum Paradise" is 
about a man. Jake, who 
wants to have (he ideal 
family nnd be ihc ideal la- 



Iher He writes scripts for 
his family to follow, hoping 
they will help make him 
more like his hero. Ward 
Cleaver. 

The play examines the 
influence television has on 
American minds According 
lo Joel Murray. "Aluminum 
Paradise " is about a man 
losing himself in somelhing 
not real. "It addresses how 
asinine television really is.^' 
claimed Murray. 

Jake IS oljsessed with 
becoming Captain Family 
and listens for "prime-time 
angels" lo lell him what to 
do, Jake's own family con- 
sists of his wife, his son and 
his daughter, who slowly 
turns into a man as (he 



play progresses. Also in- 
cluded in Jake's limited 
world are a half-dozen 
friends and, of course, the 
television set 

Murray stales that the 
characters in 'Aluminum 
Paradise ' are morally 
depraved, "The violence is 
arbitrary." he states. 

Naturally the set com- 
plements the play The PIT 
stage has been raked, the 
floor has been slrewn with 
magaiine clippings and 
mannequins and cameras 
litter the theatre. The es- 



sence is sheer Americana 

The characters, however, 
are nowhere near the norm. 

According to Murray the 
play goes backward and 
forward through time, 
lending a nightmarish 
shadow to the production. 
The play should not be 
looked at realistically, cau- 
tioned Murray, but 
surrealislically 

'■Aluminum Paradise" 
opens Feb. 19 and runs 
Friday and Saturdav nights 
for Ihrt 



weekends.
