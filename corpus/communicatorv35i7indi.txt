It's that lime again, the 
seasons are changing, night is 
coming faster, and the students 
have just settled in to the fait 
semester classes. 

This is such a good time to 
bring up spring registration. 

Some people aren't look- 
ing forward to registration 
because it's one more thing to 
add to the to-do list. 

Others are excited because 
registration means one more 
semester is done, and they're 
one step closer to graduation. 

Many will travel to 
OASIS - the online IPFW site - 
to register, but some will 
remain thirsty for knowledge. 
While planning classes, there 
are many things to consider. 

One important aspect of 
registration is financial aid, 

ACCS 

hosting 

etiquette 

dinner 

By Kelly Royal 
The Com municator 

Ever worry that you'll be 
caught with the wrong fork? Or 
wonder how you will possibly 
juggle a drink and appetizers 
all while shaking someone's 
hand? 

IPFW students can avoid 
embarrassing moments like 
these by taking advantage of a 
lesson in etiquette from 4 to 7 
p.m. on Oct. 20, when 
Academic Counseling and 
Career Services (ACCS) will 
host its first Dining Etiquette 
and Networking Dinner 

Dining at The Summit 
Club, located at 110 West Berry 
Street in downtown Fort 
Wayne, students will enjoy a 
four-course meal and an oppor- 
tunity to mingle and network 
with IPFW Alumni. 

Plans for the dinner origi- 
nally came together last semes- 
ter when Jennifer Mayhall, aca- 
demic advisor and career coun- 
selor for ACCS, and Jennifer 
Bosk, director of alumni rela- 
tions, decided to partner alumni 
with students to make create a 
larger more meaningful event.

will not work this semester - 
and he's happier than ever. 

Van is leisurely studying 
Spanish at the Dragon's Keep

ing money over the summer, he 
decided to take a different 
approach to living for the fall. 

"I'm investing in myself 
more than I am flipping ham- 
burgers or running a register 
somewhere in order to survive. 
(People) say that I'm constantly 
smiling," he said. 

Van is in his fifth year as a 
senior working towards a dou- 
ble-degree in Political Science 
and Communications. He 
worked every semester for the 
previous four years. 

The debate over whether 
or not college students should 
work has been in controversy 
for years. Lawmakers, lending

IPFW Assistant Professor

Division of the National

Simpson says she decided 
to write the book after several 
people who knew of her 
research into racial equality in 
the education system encour-

The University of Toronto 
Press summarizes Simpson's 
book this way: "In 'I Have 
Been Wailing,' Jennifer 
Simpson pays explicit attention 
to the ways in which systems of 
higher education have excluded 
people of colour, and how 
white students and teachers 
might better address issues of 
race and racism in educational 
settings. 

"Simpson's argument is 
wide-ranging and incisive. She

Many IPFW professors use then office doors and wall-spaces as a forum lo express Ibeir political

professor. Should professors leave the responses posted to preserve an open political dialogue? Or 
should they take the postings down, since it is their space?

The Communicator 
does nol believe that the student 
body should not see the 
"Fahrenheit 9/U." 

It raises many argu- 
ments about the Bush adminis- 
tration and the "war on terror-

question. 

However, the movie is 
an opinion. There i

the lack of counter-opinion. 

It would be unfair, given 
the many doubts raised about 
Michael Moore's sensational 
movie not also to offer a count- 
er opinion to present the student 



"Fahren'hype' 9/11" and 
"Celsius 41.11" responding to 
Michael Moore's film. In order 
to truly educate students on 
camps, those showing

ognize that many of the argu-

The posters with George

Perhaps a double feature

Conservative bias 
against liberal media 



Being a non-traditional 
IPFW student, I once had a job. 
Before I was a journalism 
major, I was a journalist. 

Which means: I'm a liberal. 

The problem is I'm not. 
And neither are many journalist's. 

At some point, politicians 
began blaming the media and 
contended we have some type 
of interprofessional conspiracy. 

Peter Jennings calls me 
every night with talking points, 



that there are no liberals 
media. That would be 
mount to saying there a 
brunettes in the media. But 19 
times out of 20, the theory of 
liberal bias in the media is as 
good a theory as the flat Earth. 

Here are a few things I've 
noticed. Many journalists grow 
up as writers. Writers tend to be 
more right-brained and artistic. 
Artistic people tend to be more 
open to ideas and thus more lib- 
eral-minded before they ever 
take a journalism class. 

While more liberal people 
tend to become reporters, it has 
less to do with a news coup-de- 
tat and more to do with the per- 
sonalities that select a type of 
career. You tend not to see a lot 
of poets joining the Marines. 

Journalists also see the 
worst-of-the-worst. There is 
nothing pleasant about covering 
murder stories, so when pro- 
grams hoping to curb crimes are 
introduced, reporters tend to 
consider them newsworthy.

The Battle for Innocence* an epic one

He is currently working

Leo K3 - his Mage numt - 
is the creator of The Darkside 
Clique, a local production team 
who focuses on rap/hip-hop 
music, but readily accepts other 
genres as well. 

Originally, he was only 
interested in dropping a concept 
album discussing supernatural 
occurrences, religion, child 
abuse, and other social topic, he 

In his quest to create this 
CD he enlisted DJ Spot and 
Fast Charlie for production. 

The team worked well 
together and decided to work 
with and develop other artists in 
the area. The majority of the 
work released by the Darkside 
Clique is recorded inside K3 
studios, near Fort Wayne. He is 
currently working on some 
tracks for a local acoustic musi- 
cian named Adam Atherton 

The Darkside Clique is 
comprised of Leo K3, DJ Spot 
and Fast Charlie. They have 
worked with acoustic artists, 
jazz groups, rock groups and 
many rap projects. 

DJ Spot is a bent 
maker/tumtablist who helped 
create 'The Battle for 
Innocence." 

The majority of the music 
released from the clique origi- 
nates from his ideas. His music

1 picked up 'The Battle 
For Innocence" from the well- 
known - and respected - Leo 
K3, and jumped at the chance to 
sec them perform recently. 

The disc "The Battle for 
Innocence" is now a staple in 
my car. I can't stop listening to 

I have to say. at the begin- 
ning, that this 20-track compact 
disc is worth every cent spent. 
If nothing else, for the sheer

The whole work has been 
dutifully produced by Leo K3, 
co-produced by Fast Charlie 
and DJ Spot, and mastered by 
Lorry Pester from Sweetwater 
Sound. 

Leo K3's vision has been 
brilliantly given to us. 

Each track contributes to 
the theme and resounding over- 
tones of a look at these crazy

From eerie "gcorgeor-

you ore unmistakenly taken lo a 
place of which Alfred 
Hitchcock would be proud. 

To help with the equation 
arc various local artists and sup- 
porters. 

To name just a few, per- 
formances on the disk include: 
Massakrc the Invader and 
Shang-Hi; Jarad Pagan; 
DDLUX, Rhymcwisc 37; Ry-

Somc of the highlights 1 
have to mention (hard to choose 
just a few) are Massakre the

"Everything Is On Me"

"Stand Up" with

(The velocity of the mes-

won't find anywhere else.) 

Rhymewise's passion for 
every word can't be mistaken. 
They have worked hard with 
Leo K3 lor the spot on this CD. 

"Ride with Us" with 
Chunky Chunk is a true 
favorite. However, sometimes it 
is just impossible lo capture 
how well people work with

Comedy Central has 
released two more television 
series DVD sets for your home 
viewing pleasure. Well, that's if 
you go for this sort of thing. 

The first is Strangers with 
Candy, the penultimate aftcr- 
school-speciul gone horribly 
wrong. 

Jerri Blank (Amy Sedans) 
is a middle-aged woman who 
decides to return to high school 
after dropping out to pursue a 
life of drugs, booze, and prosti- 
tution. The supporting charac- 
ters are over-thc-top spoofs of 
stereotypes you'd find in shows 
like Saved by the Bell. 

This season has Jerri get- 
ling syphilis, dealing with sud- 
den (and unexplainable) popu- 
larity and taking performance- 
enhancing drugs, among other 
things. The jokes are sometimes 
clever and often gross, but there 
are a few laugh-out-loud 

The special features are 
lacking, though not absent. 
There's a long but bland bloop- 
ers reel and a compilation of 
musical numbers from the 
series. There's an easter egg, and 
its just more musical numbers — 
but without the music. Yes, it 
appears that again a television 
show's music rights do not 
always extend to DVD sales. 
You can access these silent 
motifs by moving the cursor 
over the principal's head — but 
why would you want to? 

This set is the third and 
final season. At around S25. I 
can't recommend it unless 
you're already a fan and wish to 
complete your collection. 

The second release is the 
first season of Crank Yankers, a 
show where comedians prank 
call real people and the entire 
debacle is re-enacted with pup- 



pets. I'd already seen a lot of this 
season, as it seemed to be the 
only thing on Comedy Central 

Thinking back, I really 
should have just sat by a win- 
dow and used my pinching fin- 
gers to pretend crush soccer 
moms' heads as they power- 
walked by — il would'vc been 
more entertaining and, hey, 

Basically, these comedians 
do there best to either shock 
their victims with obscenity or 
annoy Ihem to death. They do 
characters like a mentally handi- 
capped boy, a senile old man 
and a crazy redneck — nothing 

Celebrity voices include 
Wanda Sykcs, Kevin Nealon, 
Tracey Morgan and Dennis 
Leary amongst others. 
Established comedians or nol, 
though, they're still just prank 
calls; and no character ever 
leaves the realm of ten-year-old 
humor that only the shows exec- 
utive producers, Jimmy Kimmel 
and Adam Carolla from The 
Man-Show, could think would 
entertain an audience. 

Special fealures include 
one of those pompous mini-doc- 
umentaries, with the creators lit- 
erally talking about how they 
thought it would be cool lo do a 
show with puppets, and the pup- 
pets would need a place to live, 
and so on and so forth — until 
you're sure that everyone in tel- 

bodily functions are interesting. 

Well. Will Smith did tell 

me how to wipe my ass once in 

With this set clocking in at 
around $30. and considering the 
fact that reruns are plentiful on 
the network itself. I'd recom- 
mend other cult hits on DVD 
like Family Guy. Futurama, or

inal head crusher resides).

level. Sometimes, you can get We're all supposed to love 

away with it if it's about a dead our family, but I've seen a few 



families that would be hard lo 
love. If you're the spouse of 
Charles Manson, you're going 
to be in a quirky little family. 
Probably not a lot of love there. 
Plenty of odd intensity theoriz- 
ing the end times, and maybe 
even planning not-so-well

not a lot of love. 

We're all supposed to love 
our neighbors, according to 
some religious texts. It would 
be easier to do if my neighbors 
weren't playing Nelly loud 
enough to crack the crust of the 
Earth at 2 a.m. 

Another thing that is sup- 
posedly good lo do is love your 
country. This used to be easier 
'before (a) education and (b) 
books. Ethnocentrists have an

noticed no country is perfect . . .

can be a bit like that bully 
cousin you only wanted to see 
at funerals when you were 
growing up. 

Be that as it may, it's the 
greatest country this side of 
Mexico and Canada, and pretty 
good compared to all the rest as 
well. But Australia is nice and 
warm. And girls there like guys
