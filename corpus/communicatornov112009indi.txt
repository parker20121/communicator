Beauty Pageant 
Frustrates IPFW 



Using your body for money, 
or for an education? 




r ou may have seen posters hanging up around 
campus lately advertising scholarship money 
for beautiful women. If that does not sound 
familiar, it is probably because these advertisements 
are hidden behind glimmering crowns and sashes.

Fort Wayne Receives Honorable Titles 

Will Fort Wayne one day be home to the Olympics? 



8y NealQuandt 



Winning an award is an excit- 
ing event accompanied by feelings of 
pride and joy for ihe recognition of a 
certain achievement — except when 
lhal achievement is being named the 
Dumbest City In America. 

According U Men's Health Maga- 
zine, Fort Wayne ranked first on the list 
o! dumbest cities in 2(105. Preceding 
lhal, Fort Wayne was considered the 4 th 
fattest city in ihe United States by Ihe 
Center for Disease Control. Not exactly 
commendable records for the second 
largest city in Indiana. 

2009 Is Ihe year that put Fort Wayne 
back on the map. Billboards across 
the city proclaim Fori Wayne as "Title 
Town." Fori Wayne has received three 
litles this year that citizens can be 
proud of. 

In May, Ihe Komets, Fort Wayne's 
MM. hockey team, won their 6" 1 Turner 
(Hip. This was Ihe second IHL cham- 
pionship lhal the Komets won in two 
years and iheir sixth in league since 



1952- With the potential to win a 
third Turner Cup this season, the term 
championtrip (championship * triple! 
has been coined. 

In Scplember. the Tincaps, Fort 
Wayne's Midwest League baseball 
team, christened Parkview Field by 
winning their inaugural league title. 
The controversy over the stadium still 
exists, but those who play there are bet- 
ter than any other MWL players. 

Then in June, Fori Wayne was 
named an All American Cily for the 
third lime. According to (he National 
Civic League, (he organization that 
presents the award, an All American 
City is one "in which citizens, govern- 
ment, businesses and voluntary or- 
ganizations work together to address 
critical local issues." 

However, Fort Wayne is still not in 
the running to host the Olympics. If 
you Google "Title Town," Fort Wayne- 
does not show up until page three. But 
these ihrec lilies are a step in Ihe right 
direction. At the very least. Fort Wayne- 
has noi been named the dumbest or 
fattest city of 2009— though the lists 
have not been published yot. 



SAD: The Winter Blues 
May Have You Down 



By Ana Aguirre 



The huddling groups of dozens 
of siudents start to change attire to 
match the chilly Novemher weather. 
Unfortunately, as (he weather 
changes, so do the behavior of 
individuals across campus due to the 
irritable "winter blues*. 

Known as SAD or Seasonal 
Affective Disorder, many students 
demonstrate this disorder without 
even being aware. The disorder is 
caused by a chemical imbalance due 
to die lack of sunlight. Sleeping and 
eating are more vague symptoms 
compared to the severity the disorder 
can cause. Some research states 
that SAD can affect social behavior, 
physical attributes and depression. 

Many problems that can (rigger 
SAD occur with unruly cars not 
starting, chapped lips, and chilling 
walks throughout campus, creating 



negative situations for goal oriented 
students. 

When speaking with former 
IPFW dorm resident Jordan Staus 
she remarks in irritably, "the dorms 
are harder to cope with because cars 
are always parked there and there is 
nowhere to push the snow, and lots of 
cars get stuck." 

Similar to the complex situation 
Staus reveals, most students find 
that parking lots, student housing 
and building to building classes are 
a hassle, which causes an increase 
in absences. The 2009-2010 Almanac 
predicts a bitterly cold winter for 
parts of die U.S.; ours particularly 
according to a CNN article. 

Even though the battle of the this 
year's winter blues is going to end up 
as slippery slope of downers there are 
still helpful tips to overcome these 
problematic issues. Nonetheless, as 
the winter season approaches it is 
important to brace yourself for great 
outdoors. 



Helpful Tips: 




Surround yourself in bright light 30 minutes a day 

Keep gas tank half-full to prevent freezing 

Starting vehicle 15-20 minutes before departure 

Bundle up; insulated clothing and shoes, hats, scarves, gloves 

Carry tissues, chap stick, lotion, hand sanitizer 

Walk in groups or with a friend for positive company

Smoke Hut Diaries 



By Robin Crowd I 



Smoking etiquette is like a book 
Of unwritten laws that ate instilled 
constantly and consistently in the 
minds of the majority of smokers 
everywhere. Generally, the rules 
are followed and, for the most part, 
there arc no misunderstandings. 
Unfortunately, though, there ore 
rare occasions in which the rules 
of smoker etiquette ate broken and 
upon breaking these rules always lies 

in unt ri.Kr -l.i .ill. in-. 

The first, and probably 

most important, rule is air a 

conscious effort to not blow smoke 
into the face of a non-smoker. As 
we do share the air with everybody, 
it is Important to abide by this rule 
because the inconsiderate smokers 
who choose not to follow this give 
the majority of us smokers a bad 
name. The exception to ibis rule is 
if a non-smoker willingly Imposes 
themselves to an environment 
comprised entirely of smokers (the 
smoke hut. for example]. In this 
event, it is difficult to avoid blowing 
smoke into another's face. 

The second rule of smoker 
etiquette, at least in regard to the 
smoke hut. is always put your 
cigarettes out In the ashtray, By

YOU CAN'T SHOOT HERE 

also wonder whether or not any of the students took 
the time to introduce themselves and explain what 
they needed to accomplish. Actually, I do not wonder 
since many of these young filmmakers also ventured 
into my place of employment and preceded to film 
without so much as a word or an acknowledgement 
to any of us who were involved in the background. 
I was gravely concerned about this simply due to the 
fact that my department, like so many at IPFW. has 
access to information that is protected under Federal 
law(s) and yet repeatedly groups of individuals would 
come, stand outside the doorway and proceed to film 
without giving any of us a reason why. We would be 
pleased to help students who need to have pictures 
and/or film taken of our area, but we could not 
understand why we were never given the opportunity 
to straighten up and/or hide information that we 
would not want to have other people be able to see 
and potentially exploit through the filming process. 
We were also not given the choice to personally 
not be involved in the filming process if preferred. 
While I am sure that a policy will come and we 
will all strive to work together within the confines 
of whatever guidelines the policy may provide, 
a little respect would likely have gone a long 
way in avoiding so much mutual frustration.

Is it possible to remain 
friends after a break-up? 



By Devin and Hana 



Girl: Yes. Lei us say that two people St&amp;fl Dili 
as dating without being friends lirsi. During the 

relationship you go well togethei.bui s ( (thing 

else is in the way. If you end the relationship 
on good terms, it is still possible to be friends 
However; even after a good amount ol time has 

passed, soma i can Mil reel [taloui) when 

the other person moves on with some H ■ . 

which makes things difhiitlt liul with lime, oJtol 
tins will pass and in the end. thetWOofyDUCOUld 
end up being very close. 

On the other hand, for a relationship that 
ended badly, it will take a lot of time and 
forgiveness to get back on good terms with One 
another. 1 believe that being in a relationship is 
like being best friends, but with a few extra perks. 
You add those perks to a friendship, you have a 
romantic relationship. My theory is thai, [utt 
like with friends, you have to remember what 
made you want to he around the person in the 
first place. People can do terrible things when 
they are angry or hurt, so forget that and go hack 
to the good times. 

Guy: It is hard for two people to be friends 
after a break up. Understandably so. because all 
the emotions are still there and sometimes you 
never get the closure you desire. It is even harder 
if you look at the foundation you have between 
the two of you. If you started out as friends and 
then decided you both wanted something more, 
then it might be a little easier to take it back to 
what it once was. Now. if you guys meel each 
other with only the intentions of eventually 
going out, then you guys do not really have much 
of a foundation because the foundation you did 
have was broken off. I suggest, give yourselves 
a break from each other. If you happen to meet 
up one day and become friends again, then that 
is great. It is not impossible to be friends after a 
break up, but it is rather difficult.

Wale: Attention Deficit 




By Devin Middleton 

dcvin|m 5 Wyahoo. ton 



Attention Deficit is the debut album 
by rapper Wale. He began his march 
into the public with his single 'Chillin' 
featuring Lady Gaga. Hailing from DC 
and representing the forgotten go- 
go sound, Wale has been gaining the 
respect of his peers and putting in great 
face-time by doing non-stop tours ail 
around the country. One veteran Hip 



Hop admirer he has gained is legendary 
southern rapper Bun B of UGK. The two 
have done many songs together and he 
also has a feature on the album with a 
song called "Mirrors." 

Another friend of Wale's who he 
continues to work with is Somali 
rapper, K'Naan. Dave Stiek, who is a 
producer for the band TV on the Radio. 
worked with the two rappers for a song 
called "TV in the Radio." Wale does not 
just stick to the rapper formula though. 
He also enlists singers like lazmine 
Sullivan, Melanie Fiona. Marsha 
Ambrosius and Chrisetie Michelle. 
Having legendary producer Mark 
Ronson oversee the entire project also 
helps a great deal. 

Wale's music deals with things like 
bulimia, cheating girlfriends, low self- 
esteem in African American women 
and how it feels to be from Nigerian 
heritage and moving to America. But 
he also makes sure to incorporate a few 
songs that express more of his run side, 
bringing life to the album. Attention 
Deficit will be available for purchase 
on November 10. with iTunes including 
three exclusive bonus (racks.

Julian Casablancas: Phrazes for the Young 




By Devin Middleton 



Julian Casablancas' solo album 
Phrazes for the Young is quite a ride of 
musical splendor. After a somewhat 
shaky but still satisfying performance 
on Conan O'Brien's The Tonight Show. 
news about The Strokes recording 
again and doing a few collaborations 
like 'My Drive Through' with N*E*R'D 
and Santigold, and Boom Box' with 
Lonely Island among others, kept us 
in high anticipation. With a total of 8 
songs, the CD shows a great look into 
Julien's creativity and maybe a glimpse 
into the future of The Strokes. 

Blending different sounds from 
many unsuspecting genres, the songs 
are not only greatly done but alio 
introduce you to new things you may 
have never given a chance. This is most 



evident on 'Ludlow St;' the song sounds 
like what futuristic country songs may 
sound like, [enjoy some Luke Byron and 
Little Texas, hut after listening to this, I 
may have to give even more country a 
chance, *4 Chords of the Apocalypse' 

"[Casablanca] has definitely 

learned to use his vocal 

abrtilies to their full extent 

over the years—" 



has a blues rock vibe which is perfect 
for julien's voice. He goes back to his 
trademark raspy yells on this one; f 
think we have all missed that. 

Ilth Dimension' and 'Left &amp; Right 



In The Dark' are pop classics for the new 
age, while River Of Brake] igh is' and 
'Out Of The Blue' are what I imagine 
The Strokes to sound like when they 
finally come back sometime next year. 
'Glass' And Tourist' ate both perfectly 
executed. These two songs really show 
his development as an anisL He baa 
definitely learned to use his vocal 
abilities to their full extent over the 
years and showcases them well with 
the falsetto in 'Glass's' chorus. 

Overall, this album was a great 
project. I think everyone will be able 
to find something they like about this 
project. Going for only 15 on iTunes, 
you should go ahead and pick this up. 
Phrazes for the Young will be released 
in the US. on November 3rd.

^&gt; Weezer: Raditude

C0&gt; 

Ouj 

COil 




Sounds 1 ' 

■ :

This is probably one of the most 
confusing albums to come out yet this 
war. Weezer has become one of those 
bands that are difficult to predict. For 



some musicians, this is a good thing. For 
others, it only leads to disappointment. 

There are some hopeful glimmers 
of what used to be Weezer that shine 
through on this album from time to lime. 
However when said glimmers of hope 
come through, the album reverts back 
lo the synthesizer that they seem to be 
leaning so heavily on during this album. 

What is so confusing about it is the 
opening track. '(If You're Wondering 
If 1 Want You To) 1 Want You To' comes 
off as fresh, exciting and different in a 
positive way as far at the discography of 
Weezer goes. The song ends, and begins 
the turn for the worse that Raditude 
unfortunately took. 

It is unclear if Weezer ever really did 
take their selves seriously as a band, 
but this album truly proves that they no 
longer da 'Love Is the Answer* sounds 
like a poor attempt to poke fun at The 
Beades' 'Within You. Without You.' Any 
other song that begins well seems to end 
poorly yet again with the integration of 
the obnoxious synth that they decided to 
implement 

If Weezer fans are looking for another 
Pinkenon or even Blue Album, not to 
mention Maladroit, which was probably 
the last fully enjoyable album they put 
out. this album will sorely and sadly 
disappoint.

Anne Boese scored 20 and Stephanie Rosado 19, as Dons hold Manchester scoreless for first 9:20 of game 



By GoMastodons.com 



Fort Wayne. IN -The 
IPFW Mastodons used 
a pressure defense that 
forced 32 Manchester 
College turnovers, 

and held the Spartans 
scoreless for the first 9:20 
of the game, while using 
a balanced offense of 
their own to topple the 
NCAA Division III school 
92-30 in an exhibition 
game at the Milliard 
Gates Sports Center on 
Friday evening. 

Anne Boese scored 
a game-high 20 points, 
hitting 5-of-B three- 
point baskets while 
Stephanie Rosado, in her 
Mastodon debut, added 
19, all in the first half, 
leading live Mastodons 
in double-figures in the 
game. Eva Ivanova hit 
5-of-6 shots from the 
field, scoring 14 points, 
as Chelsey Jackson had 
12 and Kim Kline 10. the 
latter in her first game in 
an IPFW uniform. lordan 
Zuppe and Hannah 
lones narrowly missed 
double figures each with 
eight and seven points, 
respectively. 

Rosado and Sarah 
Kaluska pulled down 
seven rebounds each to 
lead the team, as IPFW 
out-rebounded the 

47-32 in the 



game. Courtney Reed 
dished out seven assists, 
and grabbed five steals in 
26 minutes of action. 

IPFW, playing an up- 
tempo, pressure defense, 
held the Spartans off 
the scoreboard until 
Libby Patttson hit a free 
throw with 10:40 on 
the first-half clock, but 
the damage had been 
done, as IPFW scored 22 
points during that span. 
The first-half lead grew 
to as many as 29 on I 
occasions, the first on 
Rosado's third and final 
three-point basket of 
the game, and the final 
time when Ivanova hit 
a lay-in off of a Haluska 
assist with five seconds 
left in the half, giving 
the Mastodons a 43-14 
[ i . 1 1 1 1 1 mi lead. 

The Mastodon 

defense again opened 
a half strong, keeping 
the Spartans off the 
scoreboard for the first 
5:47 of the second half, 
pushing ahead to a 59- 
14 lead before Kailey 
Honn hit a lay-in, ending 
the IPFW 13-0 run. The 
Mastodons cruised the 
rest of the way, leading 
by as many as 67, before 
the visitors ended the 
game on a 5-0 run. to 
give the game its 92-30 
final score.

Health Kick: Being an IPFW 
athlete is not all about the win 



Health Kick: Pictured is Athlete Sarah Swanson. 



By Ana Ayuirre 

aguiiKI 1 Oiiudtnu. kpfva ula 



Being an IPFW Ath- 
lete is more than just 
winning: there is much 
more behind the scenes. 
Most athletes hit the gym 
3-5 times a week, de- 
pending if it is an on or 
off season, and maintain 
a healthy diet. 

When speaking with 
Athlete Sarah Swanson 
l»2), outfielder on the 
IPFW women's Softball 
team, she gave me an 
insightful visual image 
of her everyday routine: 



the ups and downs of her 
busy schedule, and the 
overall performance she 
has on and off the held. 

Swanson. who has 
played since 2007. por- 
trays a hard working ath- 
lete with a healthy life- 
style. 

When working one 
of her 7 a.m. weekly ses- 
sions, Swanson starts 
her day with stretching 
a routine lift and con- 
ditioning. Swanson and 
her team gathers with 
Kevin Rudolph, trainer 
located at IPFW Hiliiard 
Gales gym for their early 
morning training 

Swanson explains 



that lifting three rimes a 
week is mandatory and 
weight is recorded to 
keep track of improve- 
ment. 

Not only does Swan- 
son join her team in rou- 
tine conditioning and 
self motivated mile runs 
during the week, she also 
explains that having a 
balanced diet is impor- 
tant as well. 

'Earing right starts 
with working out. even 
20 minutes a day working 
out makes a difference.* 
said Swanson. She ex- 
plains that a high protein 
diet such as chicken and 
lots of carbohydrates be- 



fore a game fuels her for 
the next win. 

Her current status 
remains over-achieving 
and she gloats slightly 
that her new softbaU 
coach, Amy Tutor, con- 
gratulated Swanson for 
being the highlight of the 
season. Swanson's 110% 
dedication for her team 
and teammates gives 
her an impressive back- 
ground. 

She smiles and says. 
"I love to play, I am go- 
ing to do what it takes.' 
Even if it means late 
nights studying and hard 
training. Swanson knows 
what to do.
