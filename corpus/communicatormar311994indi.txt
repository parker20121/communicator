Authoritarian actions of President Beering questioned 



Professors unhappy

Will the Issue of inicgrily on the 
campus Cause i ndc pendence for 
IPFW7 

Fiscal management agrccmcnl, 
fiscal autonomy ami micromnnage- 
ment They have once again 
become familiar words on the 
IPFW campus (0 faculty, students 
and administrators. 

There is ;i growing sentiment 
among many individuals on campus 
lo address IPFW's fiscal autonomy. 

Presently, this campus has acad- 
emic autonomy, but further debate 
for fiscal autonomy is being voiced 
dirougbout ihc campus community. 
An anonymous source reported 
Purdue President Sieven Bearing's 
recent letter to Walter llelmke noii- 
fied llelmke of the dissolvement of 
the Search Committee. 

Michael C. Downs, chair of die 
political science department, said, 
"My understanding from President 



Beering's letter was that the search 
committee was to disband because 
the committee's work was done, but 
that Beering hoped as individuals 
they would continue to relate to the 
chancellor search," said Downs. 

"This is unfortunate as this 
action represents a break from tradi- 
tion in the way these committees 
should be run," said Downs. 

Patrick J. Ashton, professor of 
sociology and anthropology 
expressed his concern for Beering's 
recent action. 

"Beering has rekindled and 
fanned die flames of independence, 
we need to move ahead (o seek 
autonomy from Purdue; at the very 
minimum, fiscal autonomy," said 
Ashton. 

"Beering has put this squarely on 
Ihc agenda, when it was not there 
before," said Ashton. 

Ashton believes die debate issue 
will continue to simmer and will 
come to the surface again in the 
fall. 

"Beering has himself to blame 
with his outdated management 
style," said Ashton. 

When asked to comment on fis- 
cal auionomy for the IPFW campus, 



Beering said, "The policy of fiscal 
management is the overall responsi- 
bility of the trustees of Purdue 
University. The trustees delegate to 
the president spe- 
cific details of the 
management of the 
campus, the prcsi' 
dent in lurn dele- 
gates to the IPFW 
chancellor," said 
Beering. 

T h 

Managcmcn 
Agreemen 
between IPFW and 
Purdue was estab- 
lished last year. As 
reported in ihe 
January 1993 
of The 

Communicator 
the Managcmen 
Agreement is i 
legal document 
defining the roles 
of the two universities sharing the 
IPFW Campus. Every five years the 
document is renewed. 

The Management Agreement 
authorized ihe formation of ihe 
Community Advisory Council wiih 



members chosen by either one of 
the presidents from 1U or Purdue 
The university president not 
involved in the member selection 
along with the 
IPFW chancel- 
lor can suggest 
appointees. 

The arti- 
also states 
fiscal autonomy 
and the new 
management 
agreement are 
related, but dif- 
ferent issues. 

Also 
hen asked lo 
comment on die 
bandonment 
of the search 
mm i t tc c , 
;ring denied 
t it had been 
banded and 
did not mention 
the letter addressed to Helmke. 

"He has put whomever the next 
chancellor will be in a bad posi- 
tion," said Ashton. "Beering is so 
against aulonomy. but in fact he is 
pushing us towards it. I don't pre- 




tend to understand his motives." 

Julius J. Smulkslys, professor of 
political science, wrote an editorial 
commentary for the Fort Wayne 
Journal Gazette last week, express- 
ing his views supporting fiscal 
autonomy. 

In his article he thanked Ihe fac- 
ulty, students, administrators and 
leaders of the local community for 
their efforts in assisting to make 
Beering's attempt to make the Fort 
Wayne Campus an extension of 
Purdue fail. 

Smulkstys further said in his 
commentary that "undoubtedly, 
IPFW's integrity is diminished, 
when it cannot be trusted even to 
conduct die interviews: or how can 
one talk about autonomy when 
West Lafayette decides what is 
'consistent' with your 'past prac- 
tice,' and what is not. A search that 
started out well, now has been 
reduced to a farce. A farce that is 
not entirely funny because the new 
chancellor, whoever that person is. 
will start with a stigma of being 
you-know-whose boy or girl." 

Smulkstys' commentary further 
suggested Beering "would finally 
realize (hat here both town and 



gown were opposed to the adminis- 
tration of the local campus by 
remote control from West 
Lafafayette." 

"As far as IPFW is concerned," 
Smulkslys advised the 

Communicator, "this interference 
(by Beering) creates an atmosphere 
of mistrust and suggests that he 
does not irusl the committee." 

"No one is working as hard as he 
is ai alienating his employees." 
added Smulkslys. "He doesn't trust 
us lo make at least one recommen- 
dation." 

"Whereas evaluations of candi- 
dates used lo go to ihe Search 
Committee, Ihcy now go straight lo 
Purdue and Beering." said 
Smulkstys. 

"Now. die process reminds me 
of elections in the Soviet Union, 
when government supervised the 
elections and counted the ballets 
and announced the results without 
any ouisidc checks," said 
Smulkstys. 

"He has poured gas on the 
flames of independence, he has 
shown us Ihe limits of being in the 
Purdue system," said Ashton.

APATHY- an unpleasant word thai 
; the Black Collegian Caucus has 
become all too familiar with. 

Black Collegian Caucus President 
Yvctle Williams expressed her concern 
over what could happen if more stu- 
- dents choose not to get involved: "The 
group could become obsolete (which I 
don't want to happen), if more people 
don't get involved," 

The group's officers stressed that 
the BCC exists as a vehicle for students 
and serves as their means to achieve 
change and promote cultural aw arc - 

"BCC is here to provide a positive 
vehicle for African-American students 
to come together and have fun," said 
Chns Douse, treasurer of the caucus. 

Due to the gathering of students, the 
BCC becomes "A vessel for unifica- 
tion." Williams said. 

According to Williams and Douse, 
I there arc a number of African- 
Americans on campus who arc not 
aware that an ethnic organization like 
the BCC exists, however, there arc oth- 
ers who do know of the group, but they 
are not members and they arc highly 
critical, to these individuals. Douse 
said; "Don't criticize until you become

By Jo Ann Steinforth 
News Editor 

Deborah Green, a lobbyist with 
die firm Ross &amp; Green, will discuss 
"Waco: A Civil Liberties Disaster," 
April 4 on the IPFW campus. The 
Washington D.C. lobbyist will be 
addressing First Amendment issues 
in an event sponsored by the depart- 
ment of Sociology and 
Anthropology. 

Article 1 of the Constitution 
stales that "Congress shall make no 
law respecting an establishment of 
religion, or prohibiting ihe free 
enterprise thereof; or abridging the 
freedom of speech, or of ihe press; 
or the right of the people peaceably 
to assemble, and to petition ihe 
Government for a redress of griev- 
ances." 

The mission of her firm is to pro- 
tect civil liberties from the anti-lib- 
erty cull movement. 

The incident in Waco, Texas, 
was cast into the national spotlight, 
when on April 19, 1993, the FBI 
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms began its assault on 
the compound of David Korcsh and 
his religious followers, the Branch 

I Viu.1i.iii- 

Cull Awareness Network was 
working with the FBI, a group that 
alleged the Davidians were practic- 
ing child abuse and sexual perver- 
sion and promoting this to the 
media. 

According to Green, ihe fear of 
child abuse was the reason for ihe 
FBI raid on ihe compound. But, in 
Green's opinion, there was no con- 
cern from Koresh's neighbors. 

Ross &amp; Green specialize in 
issues of democracy and civil riehis 
and their aim is to protect civil lib- 
erty from the am- liberty cult move- 
ment . 

"We want stricter respect for 



First Amendment activities," said 
Green. "A person's religious prac- 
tice can' t be a basis for law enforce- 
ment taking action; Ihe Waco inci- 
dent showed that they went over the 
iineV" said Green. 

Green is working with James 
Tabor, an Associate Professor of 
Religious Students 
at ihe University oi 
Norlh Carolina, 
who is an expert 
on apocalyptiL al 
religions. 



Green, the 



knowing 
Koresh s apoca- 
lyptical belief, 
could have found 
other, less con- 
frontational solu

invalid CAN'S theories of "brain- 
washing" and "mind control" — the 
notion lhai there is a technique for 
controlling Ihe human will at a dis- 
tance without force or threat of 
force. Green stales thai govern- 
ment authorities may already be 
drawing the wrong 
lessons from Waco. 
Lasi spring, the 
Illinois State 

Legislature passed 
Resolution 448. It 
states. "Whereas, 
the recent activities 
of David Koresh 
and his Branch 
Davidian sect in 
Waco, Texas, have 
increased national 
awareness of the 
destructive nature 
of cult activities..." 
The resolution 
goes on to warn 
that students on 
college campuses 
are particularly vul- 
nerable to "cull"

recruitment activi- 
ties, and alleges that 
joining a "cult" 
causes students to 
."undergo personali- 



ty changes, suffer academically, etc. 

The legislature has since backed 
off. "the resolution hampers consti- 
tutional rights," said Green. 

"If it's okay for Catholics or 
Jews to have rights on campus, then 
non-mainstream religions should 



Malony, an ordained Methodist have rights as well.' said Green, 

minister as well as a clinical psy- "The government can'i make dis- 

chologist at Fuller Theological unctions among religions." 

Seminary, The American Green sees this as a threat to 

Psychological Association and The everyone's religious freedom. 

American Sociological Association Green states she has problems on 



many levels with Ihc term "brain- 
washing." 

Green does not believe a person 
can be "brainwashed." 
"Coercion works, if you deprive 
people of food or sleep lone 
enough, or torture them, they will 
say anything you want. But a per- 
son can not be brainwashed." Green 
said. 

"Followers join cults of iheir free 
will; religious conversion is a 
choice," said Green. 

Green and associate are working 
with experts and citizens in the area 
of civil rights anil religion that are 
concerned about religious liberty. 

Alan Sione is one of those 
experts. 

Stone had been retained by the 
Department of Jusiice to evaluate 
law enforcement action at Waco. 
condemned the FBI's "misguided 
and punishing law enforcement 
strategy." Stone is a professor of 
psychiatry and law at Harvard 
University and has criticized ihe 
FBI agency for ignoring the advice 
of its own behavioral experts. 

There is an FBI mandate to 
review and make changes. 

There is some indication they 
are revising (heir procedures by 
requiring that Iheir staff receive 
more scientific and more accurate 
information." said Green. 

Green feels the FBI did noi give 
enough attention to the religious 
views of the Branch Dividians and 
that they used excessive force. 

"As a lobbyist, we are concerned 
about the FBI's need to consult 
respectable scholars who are famil- 
iar wilb non-mainstream religious 
ideology." said Green. 

She thinks the FBI was mouvat- 
ed financially and was controlled by 
their mind-set of "gang -busters."

Staff Editorial 



Most siudems feel thai profes- 
sors here al IPFW genuinely 
attempt to help (hose students in 
the classroom (bat arc in need of 
help. 

Even so. there are still some 
professors who feel thai since they 
understand (he material being pre- 
sented so should everyone else. 
Oflcn the faculty appears (o forget 
that without the students (hey 
frankly do not have jobs. 

In the same respeel, some pro- 
fessors will assign a massive 
amount of material in a short time 
period. 

Professors all too often seem to 
think that their class is the only one 
thai students arc carrying on (heir 
schedules. 

Some professors might use the 
excuse of their schedules and the 



"lime crunch" that all of us fall into 
from lime lo lime as Ihe reasoning 
behind the huge assignments. 

Another problem may lie in the 
fact thai some professors cannot 
teach and were not meant to. Some 
people arc bom with a natural abili- 
ty lo express and communicate 
information (o others effectively. 

If a professor cannot adequately 
impart knowledge (o the students, 
then it makes no difference whether 
or not the person has a bachelor's 
or a doctorate. The professor's 
knowledge and degree arc useless 
if they cannot be translated inio a 
learning experience. 

Not only do these situations 
pose problems for the students, but 
they also pose another dilemma 
when a professor wishes to have 



ihe student express and support 
personal opinions. 

This situation oflcn occurs in 
writing courses where opinion is 
part of Ihe assigned writings. There 
are instances where a professor 
will mark a student's paper based 
on the viewpoint expressed rather 
than quality of the content. 

Too often professors forget lo 
leave their biased opinions al 
home, and fail to allow ihe student 
to develop ideas further. Most stu- 
dents enjoy writing aboul values 
that they have, if they are not 
intimidated by the professors abili- 
ty to change their grades. 

Professors who encourage stu- 
dents to examine controversial 
issues might even learn something 
from the students. 




Letter from 
the Chancellor 



Joanne B. Lanlz, Chancellor 



TO THE 
STUDENTS, 
FACULTY, AND 
STAFF 

In the last few days, I have 
been made painfully aware of 
several incidents of harass- 
ment directed toward mem- 
bers of the campus communi- 
ty because of their race, gen- 
der, religion, or sexual prefer- 
ence. I strongly condemn 
these despicable acts of dis- 
crimination. IPFW must be 



better than that. The universi- 
ty has taken-and will contin- 
ue to take-a firm stand 
regarding non-discrimination 
and respect for all. I urge all 
faculty, staff, and students to 
join with me in recommitting 
ourselves to providing a 
learning environment built on 
equality, freedom, and 
respect. All of us deserve no 
less!

To Ihe Ediior: 

Usually, a snot-nose kid trying to 
be a "bit shot" is just funny. This 
lime it's dangerous, 

I can't believe what I just read in 
The Communicator: "A Dose of 
Douse" Thursday 3-24-94. I'm 
assuming it was written by F. Lane 
Douse, itdoesn'isay. It is an editor- 
ial opinion of The Communicator. 

On one hand, you're implying 
your remarks are meant merely lo 
wake us slupid "while folk" up. On 
ihe other hand, you're slill saying 
the massacre in New York is under- 
standable! You call it an acci- 
dent?!!!!!! 

My God, son, listen to your- 
self!!! 

In ihe firsi place, don't you dare 
lake ii upon your arrogant lilUe self 
to assume what emotions I've had 
to experience!!! 

Since long before you've been 
on this earth I've been dealing wiih 
political statements and actions I 
disagree with. When you say there's 



nothing you can do about it you're 
simply telling me you're too 
damned lazy lo get off your bun 
and do it. Just shooi all ibe 
wbiieys — that' 11 take care of it! 

I have endured severe frustration 
just trying to survive in this society. 
but I never considered shooiing a 
bunch of black people because one 
of them hurl me. As a matter of 
faci, many Blacks have hurt me 
deeply. 

If your stupid remarks are sim- 
ply a way of trying to prove a point, 
you missed the boat, son, and it 
sounds lo me like you really should 
beoniL 

Why do I keep calling you son? 
Because I love you, but I'm so 
angry I can hardly write this. I view 
every young man as a "son." It's 
thai maternal thing. I don't see any 
of you as a "white son" or a "black 
son." and I don't want any of you to 
be hurt. 

My own children suffered 
because they had a mother who 



refused to make ihe distinction 
between black and white or any 
other skin color, but simply judged 
people on their own merits. 

This society, did a job on ihem- 
both Blacks and Whites. That's why 
ii makes me sick to read this. Too 
many people have suffered too 
much trying lo fosler understanding 
and acceptance between the races. 

What makes you ihink you have 
a monopoly on suffering? By ihe 
way, exactly how much have you 
suffered personally? 

I jusi lost a much-needed job to a 
black girl because a quota had lo be 
filled. There was no aiiempl to hide 
the fact. That's just the way il Ls. If 
ii had been ihe other way around, 
thai black girl (young female — 
don'l put any other connotation lo 
it) would have had options lo fight 
it, which are not open lo me! 

I'm sick of your belly-aching! 

If you don't like something, 
organize, protest, vote, and don't 
stop! 



Part of the problem now is a lot 
of Ihe headway we made in the six- 
lies has been lost because people 
got lazy. When Blacks started mak- 
ing inroads Ihey look it and ran. 
They did nol reach down and help 
weir brothers and sisters. And all of 
us who really cared did nol realize 
the battle had nol been won. We can 
never rest in this one, il will always 
be there and it must always be 
fought. 

And, I know for an absolute per- 
sonal fact dial many while people 
who try to make things right just get 
kicked in the head by Blacks. 
You're doing il lo yourselves. 

When you lump "white folks" 
inio one group and impose your 
judgment on them as a whole: when 
you refer to "white folk" as one 
entity, don'l you know what lhat is? 

That, lillte brother, is Racism 

Thai is the problem! 

I'm ashamed of you.

Student disapproves of Aunt Louise's advice 



Leiier lo ihe Editor. 

1 would like to respond to Aunt 
Louise's column in the March 24th 
issue regarding A While Man Who 
Wants A Monlb. First I do noi 
agree that there should be such a 
month, nor do I like Rush 
Limbaugh, lei alone agree wiih him. 
However, I wonder why Auni 
Louise responded die way she did. 
Aunt Louise in her infinite wisdom 
should know lhat to condemn thai 
guy the way she did, did not edu- 
cate him as to why there should not 



be such a month. In fact, she 
became what she claims lo despise. 
Think back to the public school 
days, whose history did mosi of us 
Icam about and from whose per- 
specdve? The while mans. 

Now, to the While Man Who 
Wants A Month, how well did you 
pay attention to lhat history? I do 
nol wish to attack personal charac- 
ler because I do not know Aunt 
Louise or The White Man Who 
Wants a Month. I do wish to ques- 
tion if ihis is ihe way people should 



communicate on our campus? I 
hope not. Without fully knowing 
the spirit or the context in which 
this person asked Auni Louise bis 
question, shouldn't she assume that 
this person had a genuine question? 
Auni Louise should have taken the 
opportunity lo make positive com- 
ments or present ideas lhat have 
moral foundations, rather than slan- 
der and demean him? Personally I 
believe that someone is more likely 
to listen or consider a point of view 
if it is positive and in good spirit. 



nol negative and a personal attack I 
have enjoyed Aunt Louise's column 
in the past, now I'm not so sure. 
These days there arc enough nega- 
tive comments and accusations 
fueled by ignorance and suspicion. 

How much can be accomplished 
in race relations if people not only 
disrespect personal character bui do 
give others the benefit of die doubt 
once in a while and a little "old 
fashioned" mist?

Freedom of speech is invalid if it is not what

Editor In chief 

and ¥. Lane Douse 

Features Editor 

According 10 ihe First 

Amcndmcni. "Congress shall make 

no law respecting an cslablishmenl

exercise thereof; or abridging ihe 

freedom of speech, or of the press,

Government for a redress of griev- 

Now, that is what your constitu- 
tion says, however, that's quite dif- 
ferent from what has happened on 
this campus. 

We do not believe that so many 
people have ever entered the ncvJi- 
paper with such arrogance, igno- 
rance, and disrespect. People 
demanding thai the paper be exam- 
ined by higher individuals and 
revamped so to speak without 
accepting the fact that the student 
editor is the highest authority of a 
student newspaper. 

We find it rather humorous that 
some students are asking that Ihe 
content of the paper be looked at 
and again revamped'' Has anyone of 
these educated persons ever heard 
of censorship? 

Why is this? Could it be that this 
paper is addressing issues that arc 
often considered trite? Arc we 



speakrng with too much frankness 
by rejecting the melting pot concept 
of everyone being the same? 

This paper must be hitting close 
to home. Why else would so many 
of its readers be taking such a per- 
sonal stand against so many of its 

Well, this is a concept that we at 
The Communicator do not and will 
not allow! Whenever one puts 
truths in front of others, then (hey 
arc often offended and hurt. Dut 
again the truth is the truth. 

.So, here we go with the truth 
We feel that the problem most stu- 
dents have is with the fact that for 
the past semester and a half the 
reigns have been held by non-white 
people. These editors have begun to 
address issues that deal specifically 
with the issue of race. An issue thai 
automatically causes a portion of 
while folks to throw up red flags 
because these may be views consid- 
ered "racist." 

Yet they have no problem in 
responding 10 the issue by attacking 
the writer personally instead of 
dealing with the issue at hand. We, 
as African -Americans, are labeled 
as being racists, bellyaching, or 
whining about our condition. Some 
people seem to have a problem with 
the fact that we cannot be silenced 
because we arc the ones who arc in 
charge of the paper. We arc the 



ones who are in power. And some 
white folks on this campus cannot 
handle it 

The attitude of people on this 
campus is reminiscent of the words 
of Derrick Bell, author of "Faces of 
the Bottom of the Well: the 
Permanence of Racism," who states 
in his story, "The Last Black Men)": 
"[WJhites treat a militant speech — 
not action, mind you, but a speech, 
a presentation of rhetoric in pub- 
lic — like a revolutionary conspira- 
cy. Whenever a small group of 
blacks gather for some purpose 
more serious than a card parly. 
whites get upset." 

Some of these people have 
become upset because according to 
Andrew Hacker, the author of "Two 
Nations," we as African-Americans 
have become "an obtrusive pres- 
ence ... in places . . . (we) do not 
belong." 

Instead of allowing the racist cli- 
mate on this campus define our 
space, we have defined it for our- 
selves by speaking out on issues 
that affect us directly. It is this self- 
definition that has been so unset- 
tling to the white population on this 
campus. 

However, instead of joining the 
staff and squaring off in a public 
debate on these issues, people 
attack our character, or anonymous- 
ly take the cowardly way out by 



distributing racist and sexually 
biased underground newspapers. 

These persons concentrate on the 
words that are offensive to them 
and never address the content of the 
commentary. Is this because they 
have no argument? 

Let us not forget a recent phone 
message left at The Communicator 
asking for the resignation of one of 
our student editors. 

Actually, what this boils down to 
is one thing. The fear of the reality 
that the majority folks in (he United 
States (white folks) are slowly 
becoming the minority. The domi- 
nant culture is afraid that the minor- 
ity culture is going to take over. It's 
going to happen whether we like it 
or not. So instead of all of us bick- 
ering, why don't we sit down at a 
table and address the issues instead 
of sweeping them under the nig? 

Most importantly, why don't 
people respect Ihe fact the we also 
have freedom of speech just as 
Rush Limbaugh and Louis 
Farrakhan. Even though we do not 
always agree with Rush and Louis, 
we strongly support their right to 
freedom of speech. 

We're all in this together. The 
only way we are going to survive is 
if we get together and deal with 
issues effectively. We don't have to 
agree. Dut we do have lo agree to 
disagree. 



Clocks at IPFW need maintenance 



To die Editor: 

As a student at IPFW I am 

expected to be in class on lime. 
Even when the weather is a little 
rough, I still slip and slide to get to 
class on lime, 

As 1 came running or sliding in, 
Ihe firsl thing I do is to look al ihe 
clocks lo sec what time it is.

Unfortunately this is not much help. 
Some of ihe clocks in Kettler Hall 
haven't worked since the fall of 
1993. The clocks in other buildings 
arc set to various limes. There is a 
five hour lime difference between 
(he cast and west ends. 

Perhaps I'm confused. Maybe 
the clocks at IPFW aren't hung on 
the walls for ihe practical purpose 



of displaying time but rather as 
examples of modem an. I doubt it. 

The university is run on time. 
Each class starts and ends al a spe- 
cific lime for a reason. Each of us 
has paid for his or her allotted lime. 
Since time and punctuality arc so 
important to this university, it 
seems like the powers 10 be would 
be more concerned with the setting

Why not 
Men's studies? 

Although Women's Studied has 
heal aclrvu and visible .it IPFW for 
about 20 years, one iliJI encounters 
colleague! and student who ask: 
"When arc v/c going to get Men's 
Studies?" K Ihc cjuesiion is meant 
(and sometimes ii is) as a put down 
of Women's Studies, ihcn is 
deserves the glib comeback deliv- 
ered by Aunt Louise in last week's 
Communicator. "All ihe other sub- 
jects in the curriculum arc Men's 
Studies, dummy " Today, though, 
I'd like to look at this question 
from another perspective. 

Even among teachers and stu- 
dents of Women's Studies. Ihe 
name is not without its problems. 
An important aim of Women.';. 
Studies courses is 10 understand the 
experiences, statuses, contributions, 
roles, civil rights, problems, and 
possibilities of women specifically 
because these topics are mostly 
overlooked in schools and colleges 
just about everywhere. Yet the cat- 
egory "woman" is not sufficient in 
understanding the meanings of 
these topics, since women's experi- 
ences, statues, etc.. etc, arc very 
different not only across cultures 
and historical periods, but also 
within the same culture depending 
upon such factors as race or ethnic- 
ity, class background, sexual orien- 
tation, and many others (see 
Women's Studies goal #6 in the 
program brochure!). Despite super- 
ficial similarities such as (he ability 



to ovulate, women may have more 
in common with men of their own 
race, class, and culture lhan with 
women of another race, class, cul- 
ture (It should, by the way, be 
abundantly clear by now (hat

Of course. 1 think we all know 
why they are after the paper, are

IPFW alumnus makes run for congress 



Jeanette Clausen

and Woman's Studies 

about women!) 

An alternate term that at first 
appears to solve the problem is 
"Gender Studies," which avoids the 
focus on biological differences and 
instead emphasizes gender — the 
identities, roles, behaviors, etc. that 
women and men arc taught in a 
given culture, to diis paper, they 
need lo rethink this idea. Frankly, I 
don't think it's going to happen. 



But today. I want to close out 
with yet another answer to the 
question with which 1 began: 
Men's studies already exists as a 
topic of research and writing within 
academe. A quick keyword search 
in 10 at the IPFW library (k=men's 
studies) turned up 37 items in acad- 
emic journals. Here are a few titles 
selected at random (as Dave Barry 
would say. I am not making this 
up): "What do men want? A read- 
ing list for the male identity crisis." 
"Scholars debunk the Marlboro 
Man: examining stereotypes of 
masculinity." "What can you do 
with a man? Feminism and the crit- 
ical appraisal of masculinity." 

So, everyone out there who sees 
a need for Men's studies in addi- 
tion to Women's Studies should 
take heart — at least you aren't 
alone!

Advice 

Aunt Louise tells girl to discontinue friendship; get tested for HIV 




Congress - From page four 
Samlet feels thai if individuals dis- 
perse Ihe money 10 iliffercni seg- 
mcnis of their own community 
such as the Girl Scouls, DARE, 
and churches they will sl/engthen 
a community more than the disas- 
trous federal plans have proposed 
so far. 

Lying on Sauder't desk is a 
bumper slicker proclaiming his 
proud slogan, "It won't be Long 
now!" And perhaps for this IPFW 
alumnus, it won't be. 

Save 

the 

Whales 



Dear Aunt Louise, 

I can't believe some 
of the people thai are in 
ihis world. I stop and look 
at how people treat other 
people. For instance, I have 
this really good friend of 
mine who claims that she 
likes this guy who is a good 
friend of mine. However, 
every lime I turn around 
she is out screwing some- 
body else. Now. my prob- 
lem is that I don't know if I 



should butt out of her busi- 
ness or tell the guy who she 
likes what she is doing. I'm 
at the point where 1 don't 
respect this female friend 
of mine as much as I 
respect my friendship with 
the guy. I don't care for the 
way she is treating the 
other guy. I know he's not 
doing the same to her. 

What should 1 do? 
Desperately, 
Torn Between Two Friends 



Dear Tom Between Two 
Friends, 

What you need to do 
is tell this female friend of 
jours that you can no 
longer continue the friend- 
ship because of the way she 
is acting toward your male 
friend. 1 think it's always 
right to be honest. The 
good book says that. So, 
that's what I think you 
should do. And don't worry- 
about what she has to say 



because she isn't a friend 
to either one of you. If she 
was a true person, she 
wouldn't be leading that 
poor young lad into 
heartache. I know that's 
what she's doing. So, the 
best thing to do is to break 
up the friendship unless 
she's willing to change. 

As far as telling your 
male friend, I would ask 
her to tell him before you 
do. If she decides not to, 



than I think as a friend j ou 
should break the news to 
him .is light!) as possible 
Use the best sugar-coating 
.is possible, without K ing 
of course, because his heart 
is going to be broken. 

Your loving 

Aunt Louise 
Dear Aunt I ouise, 

I have a problem of 
urgent matter.

Film depicts real life of newsroom 



by Sharmin Mcgown 
Guest Writer 

The journalism business is 
a harsh place. 

Think of all the responsibil- 
ity: you decide what people 
see and read, even what peo- 
ple believe. A journalist has a 
daily struggle with right and 
wrong; what goes in a story 
and what doesn't. 

The recently released 
movie, 'The Paper," examines 
such a struggle. The siaff of 



the New York Daily Sun, the largest of which is Alisha, 
headed by Bernie (Robert the managing editor, expert 
Duvall.) has to decide whether hardball player, and all- 
lo run a front page article 
accusing two African- 
American youths of a racially 
motivated murder. Staff writer 
Henry (Michael Keaton) and 
his wife Marty (Marisa 
Tomei) have to uncover the 
truth about the murder. But 
there is one catch: they have 1 
only until 8 p.m. to do it. around bitch. Her main objec- 

There are many obstacles, live is to get paid; and as 




many journalist do, she tends 
to leave her conscience at 
home. 

The movie starts off slowly. 
but builds until it reaches an 
attention-demanding climax. 
It's a great movie, but consid- 
ering the movie has to do with 
the lives of two African- 
American youths hanging in 
the balance, little of those two 
dark faces appear in the 
movie. 

Using the controversial ele- 



ment of race relations was a 
nice gesture a box office ad 
for multiculiuralism and it 
was almost flawlessly pulled 
off. While more attention to 
the young men used as a 
device to launch the plot may 
have added more dimension 
to the movie, it also may have 
added a few more hours to the 
length and several more mil- 
lions to the operating budget. 

This movie is a "must-see" 
for every drama-hound.

Tennis team hits for Volleydons record triple victory 

GLVC advancement 



By Jennifer Skinner 

Head Coach Don Brogan consid- 
ers the men's tennis [cam io be fair- 
ly young. Because everyone on ihc 
icam has played college tennis 
before, he feels there is enough 
experience for a successful 1994 
season. 

"Right now we look like we're 
probably in the middle of the pack 
of our conference," said Brogan. 
"But we have the potential 10 be in 
the top three if we peak during con- 
ference." 

Future opponents Northern 
Kentucky and the University of 
Indianapolis are presenting a strong 
challenge to the men's tennis team. 

According to Brogan, Northern 
Kentucky should have a shot to win 
the title, and the University of 
Indianapolis is the only (cam in the 
GLVC which has never fallen to 
IPFW during his lime as head coach. 

"What wc need," Brogan 
said, "is good play from every 



person everyiime oui as 
opposed to what we've been 
having, a good performance by 
maybe three players and not so 
good performance by three oth- 
ers. As a team, we haven't 
played well yet. 

This weekend the tennis team 
will play in the Kerry Seward 
Memorial against many teams not 
in the GLVC. Brogan hopes this 
will help the team to gain confe- 
dence. 

Individually, Todd Rcnnic. 
junior, in his first season of play on 
the IPFW tennis team has a confer- 
ence record of 4-0 at number four 
singles. 

At number number two singles, 
Dave Krahn, junior, is 5-2 overall 
and 3-1 in the conference. 

Rod Valentine, senior, at num- 
ber six singles is 3-1. 

The tennis team's overall record 
is 3-1 and 3-1 in the GLVC. The 
conference loss was to Southern 
Indiana. 




The Weill) ranked Volleydons defeated Long Beach Stale (3-0) 15-9, 
16-14. 15-9 and Stanford (3-1) 16-14. 9-15. 15-11, 15-4 in the IPFW 
Farm Bureau Invitational last weekend In the First game, against Long 
Beach. IPFW was lead by All-Amcrican Lloy Ball recorded 54 assists, 
Five digs, and six blocks. Felipe Ralat dished out eight kills two aces, 
and four blocks. Norman Almodovar finished with 15 kills and three 
digs, and Craig Collins added 22 kills. 

Against. Stanford. In the the fourth game, the Volleydons ran out an 
11-1 lead before Ball dished out one of his 10 blocks, for IPFWs 15-11 
victory. Ball totaled 80 assists and added 10 blocks and four service aces. 
Almodovar dished out 23 kills, eight digs, ami than; service QCCS. Collins 
recorded 23 kills, four service aces, and 10 digs. 

For the week of March 28. Ball has been named AVCA Player of the 
Week. Ball is averaging .603 services per game, ranked fifth in the nation 
and surpassed the 6,000 career assist mark, totaling 939 for the season and 
6.169 for a career total. Only two other NCAA volleyball players, Chris 
Cooper of Ball State, and Jason Slimpfig, of Long Beach State, have sur- 
passed the 6,000 career assist mark. 



Lloy Ball, AVCA Player of (he Week adds another set to his car 
total of 6,169. Compliments of the athletic department.

Baseball players focus °n team 
success for the new season 



By Jennifer Skinner 
SporLi Edilor 

The men's baseball icam 
depends on one another, as a icam 
The players spend lime together, as 
a Icam. And the baseball Icam has 
sci goals, as a Icam. 

"We really didn't set individual 
goals." said Head Coach Mall 
Kinzcr. "Wc just set goals thai 
we're going to bust our tails off on 
the field. When you do thai, resulls 
happen. " 

With a 15-9 overall record and 
4-4 in the GLVC. the icam is three 
games away from setting (he school 
record for viciorics. The current 
record in wins is 18. 

"Our goal is lo scl some schqol 
records," said Kinzcr. Our goal is 
lo finish in the upper half of the 
GLVC and lo have a winning sea- 
son, which hasn't been done in a 
long lime." 

On the field there is a strong 
team emphasis. 

According to Kinzcr every- 
body's been contributing. The team 



isn't "riding on anybody's shoulder 
and every player has been "taking a 
load and picking each other up." 

Lead off hilier Mark Vince. who 
uansfcrcd from Southern Indiana, 
has a baiting average of .426, two 
home runs and 16 lo 17 walks. 

Chad Kctzler has a .353 batting 
average and three home runs. 

Malt Lciningcr has (wo home 
runs and a .323 baiting average. 

Mike Gcrbasich has a balling 
average of .309. 

As a team, the balling average is 
.300. 

Kinzcr feels (he biggest weak- 
ness is in the team's ability to make 
big plays defensively such as mis- 
judging fly balls. 

Individually. Ihc players are 
working on having the right mind 
set to play. 

According lo Kinzer, the team is 
realizing what il takes to play and 
lo "have dial type of atliudc, to be 
aggressive." 

The future confronlalions with 
opponents Ashland and the 
Universily of Indianapolis will be 




big games for IPFW. 

"Ashland we'd like to beat pret- 
ty bad and obviously Indianapolis." 
said Kinzer. "They (Indianapolis) 
beat us twice last year and (hat 
never should have happened." 

Not only on the field do Ihc 
baseball players have a icam 
emphasis, bui off the field as 
well. The players spend time 
with one another, going to 
movies and volleyball games 
logcther. 

In turn. Ihe volleyball play- 
ers attend baseball games. On 
Saturday, March 26 in ihe dou- 
blchcadcr against Bellarmine, 
ihe Volleydons set up camp 
wilh a couch and grill for cook- 
ing brats. 

"Our team's really close." said 
Kinzcr. "There's not one person 
who doesn't gel along with another. 
This is what is lakes to be a win- 
ner." 

As a team, the players will 
depend on one another, support one 
another. And as a team, they will 
scl goals together.

I just found i &gt;ui that .1 for- 
mer sex partner of mine 
may have contacted the 
HIV virus before we 
became sexually active. 
What should I do? I'm 
almost positive that it's just 
a rumor because he told 
me that he was okay. But 
my girlfriend told me that 
her best friend knows this 



guj is bisexual. I didn't. All 
"f that was news to me. So, 
should I take what my girl- 
friend says as gospel or 
gossip? 

Sincerely, 
Who Should I listen to? 

Dear Who Should I Listen 
to?. 

First of all. whenev- 



er you are dealing with the 
issue of HIV or AIDS you 
would always take it seri- 
ously, dearie. We wouldn't 
want you to end up with 
this terrible disease and all. 
So. 1 wholeheartedly sug- 
gest you gel some testing 
done and find out what's 
going on.
