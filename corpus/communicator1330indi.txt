Up lo 25 percent of Ihe classes under

olher four-year degrees, Fredrick said 
This means a student could end up 
taking five more semesters after 
completing his associate's degree. 

The reason, according lo Edward A 
Nicholson, vice chancellor and dean of 
the faculty, is because of the standards 
set by the American Assembly of 
Collegiate Schools of Business 
(AACSB). 

"They place standards on business 
schools all over Ihe country and we 
(IPFW) are one of them." Nicholson 
said "Because of its (AACSB's) 
standards, it was hard just trying loge( 
75 percent of Iheclasses to transfer."

Fredrick said. "We promoled the

Steve 



Weslrick. newly-elected

point appeal. Some of bis mosl im-

back one week: no voting facilities 
were sel up at the Depl of Fine Arts or 



Barr Street (DGTSi; and lhal no in- 
formation concerning appeal 
procedures was provided by the board 
lo any of Ihe candidates. 

"Though the election dale amend- 
ment was laler properly passed by the 
Senate, the initial passing was still 
unconstitutional." Weslrick said. 

"And by nol having voting at the Art 
School or Barr Slreet, sludenls who 
attend only these campuses were 
denied a chance lo vole for their 
Sludents* Govern men! reprcscn-

Presidential candidate Paul Michael

"l- ill-rated Wcslrick's point about Ihe

Chandler also alleged, "A man al Ihe

while Schenk was allowed lo sit al Ihe

Bolh appeals recommended that a 
new election for student body president 
take place this fall. 

Wcslrick's appeal was denied, ac- 
cording lo Gulfey, because il failed lo 
meet Ihe requirements of an appeal 
"An appeal and a recount must be filed 
separately, Ihe recount first, and Ihe 
appeal within 2i hours. Mr Weslrick 
filed the two together, so thai his appeal 
was incorrect," Gulfey said

SG ignores appeals 



A fine welcome democracy has gotten 
at JPFW, 

Suspicious of new ideas that threaten 
their power, some in the Students' 
Government are reacting to the recent 
election appeals in a manner to be ex- 
pected of the under-developed. 

They are dodging the issues and 
chanting prayers for their own 
salvation. 

Ignoring the real problems in both 
the election and appeal procedures, Ihey 
accuse those who challenge Ihem of 



■ ulterior motives and an interest 
in personal gain. 

Confusing as it may seem to have (heir 
own arrows thrown bach at them, we 
hope that those who are appealing the 
election will persevere in Ihe face of 
such hypocrisy. 

Those who are appealing the election 
results have made legitimate points. 
Those outside of Students' Government 
are always at a disadvantage in jour- 
neys through obluse regulations and 
those in the SG do nothing (o make the
