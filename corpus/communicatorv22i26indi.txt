IPFW apathy 

Student elections need 
more candidates now 

What if we threw an election, and no one came? 

Out of 11,092 students al ll'FW, only a handful have 
taken on the respnn siliililv ol initialing change and pro- 
viding a voice lo (he administration by petitioning lor 



canili&lt;l.i!es except Ihose lor the office of prcsulenl ; 
uncontested. 

This is insanity 

Unless the sllidenls on tills campus want In delaull i 

(juarlcr ol a millnui dollars ol sluilenl service innnev 

i administration, we need to get our collective asses 



gear, seek

and put them in office. 

The root of (he problem lies will] the apallichc alllludcs 
of students. Students are often overheard in the halls 
complaining aboul tin- current studcnls' government ad- 
minislralion ui about the lack nl activities on campus. But 
where are they when cleclion lime rolls around? If stu- 
dents want lo make llicir college experience a good one, 
lliev should lake steps In improve il through involvement. 

If the lack ol involvement in students' government con- 
tinues, we will suffer the consequences. If a responsible 
group of studcnls cannot he luund lo run the government 
then the funds curienllv cnnliolled by students' govern- 
ment may be turned nvcr In I be administration. 

If our funds were being handled In a group that did not 
represent I he interests ol students H might be better to 
have (|inihfied adnnuisli alms handle I tic money. But if 
possible, a democi aheallv elected group ol student lead- 
ers would be I he besl mr.nii.' In handle student 

dollars. 

With students i unninr. uncontested tni positions, the best 
interests of the student body are not being served. People 
can be elected into ollicc, when running uncontested, 
regardless of their qualifications.
