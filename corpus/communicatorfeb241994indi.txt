more women will have more 
chances to get elected to office," 
said Long. 

Long discussed her work with 
the House Committee on Veterans 
Affairs. She has sponsored bear- 
ings to address the lack of avail- 
able treatment for veterans suffer-

leadership in Great Britain as an 
example.

crimination following him,

African American Spotlight 

Multicultural Services director continues success 



by F. Lane Douse 
features Editor 

Even though she may have a 
low profile on campus, Bettye J. 
Poignard, director of Multicul- 
tural Services is hard at work in 
her office trying to increase the 
awareness of diversity. 

Leaving her position as 
Director of Professional 
Diagnostic, a regional diagnostic 
center for the mental health 
department. Poignard became 
coordinator of Minority Affairs 
in October of 1988. 

"When I first came here it was 
not an administrative position 
whatsoever," Poignard said. 
"Dean Ulmer was interested in 
upgrading the position, I agreed 
to help him." 

The only thing Poignard has 
was an office and a typewriter. 
There was no clerical staff what- 
soever. 

After working for seven 
months, Poignard requested that 
Ihe department have a change in 
name and philosophy. Former 
IPFW Chancellor Tom Wallace 
agreed completely with her. 

Now, seven years later the 
department has five professional 
staff members and three work 
study students. 

"Multicultural Services should 
be provided for all students who 
arc not in the mainstream. 
Essentially, that means African- 
Americans, Hispanics, women, 
gays and lesbians," Poignard 
commented. "We changed Ihe 
name and view to provide a 
wider range of services and to be 
an advocate for those students." 

At this present time, 
Multicultural Services provides 
services for Hispanics, Native 
Americans, and African- 
Americans. The services consist 
of counseling, outreach pro- 
grams, advising, and cultural her- 
itage programs. 

"When you are in these type of 
positions there are very little line 
item money falling into programs 
meaning university money. They 
(the programs) arc usually fund- 
ed by grants." 

One of the first things Poignard 
did was to develop an outreach 
program for students, hence the 
Future Academic Scholars Track. 

The F.A.S.T. program was 
designed to allow students to 
look at higher education as a 
viable option for them. Some of 
the aspects of the program are 
based off Poignard's study and 
personal experiences of attending 
an historically black college. 



Poignard graduated from 
Hampton University wiih a bach- 
elor's degree in Speech and 
Communication. She received 
her masters in education from 
Saint Francis College. 

"Being die product of a histori- 
cally black college, I was famil- 
iar with die support systems that 
really would help the students be 
successful and I wanted to repli- 
cate that." said Poignard. 

The aspects Poignard was 
referring to were that of role 
models, intrusive academic coun- 
seling, and a social outlet all 
geared toward students of color, 

The F.A.S.T. program also 
communicates with the families 
of the students that participate in 
the program. 

"We try to give the kids the

support they need so they know 
higher education is a viable 
option. We don't just tell them 
that. We help them," she said. 

Mastering the Possibilities, 
Making It Happen, and the 
Mentoring Program other pro- 
grams designed by Poignard. 

The lack of diversity on this 
campus is an issue that Poignard 
continues to battle. She feels dial 
it is always a conscious effort to 
keep the issue alive. 

Poignard is a sub-commillee 
chair of the Chancellor's Council 
on Minority Recruitment and 
Retention. Currently, the council 
is sponsoring cultural diversity 
workshops. 

"Just to get them to say, 'Yes. 
there is a problem," was a monu- 
mental task," Poignard said. 

"There has always been a prob- 
lem with retention of students on 
ibis campus," Poignard com- 
mented. 

She feels that the only way to 
really combat this issue is by 
developing a campus wide effort 



and not by delegating it to one 
specific office, 

"II all starts at the top." 
Poignard said. "You say this is 
what we are committed too and 
what we are doing. You put your 
dollars where your priorities 
are." 

Poignard says the campus 
needs to develop a positive 
"army" that will get the message 
of diversity out. She thinks the 
cultural diversity retreat is the 
first step in educating people to 
serve in the "army." 

"We have a long way to go," 
Poignard said "But. the positive 
side is that we have a beginning 
There are some decent people 
who really want to do something. 
People who are anti-minority 
really aren't going to change 
their minds. And that's fine. But. 
I think there should be conse- 
quences for that." 

"When I was the only one, I 
had more student contact because 
they needed to know I had an 
open door policy. I still do," she 
said. "Now, I need to be out in 
the community and slate selling 
this program. There arc few peo- 
ple in the lU-Purdue system who 
do not me or this program." 
Poignard said. 

"1 don't have time for knee- 
slapping and joking around. I'm 
not like that. That's not me, any- 
way. That's why I have young 
people in here," Poignard com- 
mented. 

"But, if there is a problem, I 
can tell you where they come," 
Poignard said. "If my staff comes 
in here and says that a student is 
being mistreated, 1 am the first 
person to go to bat for that stu- 
dent. I go to bat for my staff." 

"I support my staff," Poignard 
said. "1 want my people to leave 
my office with more skills than 
what they came with." 

She describes her office as a 
"united front." Poignard knows 
how important it is for her office 
to slay together because offices 
like hers arc always under con- 
stant criticism by others. 

She says her office tries to cap- 
italize on everyone's strength. 

Being the only highest ranking 
African -American administrator 
on this campus is a disappointing 
reality to her because there 
should be more. 

"It's not so much being the 
highest ranking because it's not 
high enough. I'm not the one 
making the decisions," said 
Poignard. "I think that's crucial."

Black History Month 



Famous American of the Revolutionary period 



Benjamin Banneker 
1731-1806 

Benjamin Banneker was the most famous Black 
American of the Revolutionary Period of 
American history. A scholar and scientist, he was 
always seeking answers, or ways of predicting 
answers to questions. 

He invented a clock, edited an almanac and had 
scientific papers read in European capitals. He 
was chosen by President Jefferson to assist in the 
development of plans for Washington, D.C. He 
and a close friend chose the site for the White 
House. 

Born a free man. he had the right to vote. He 
was known and respected here and in Europe; yet, 
by 1803 this right to vote was taken away from 
him and all other free Black Americans, in his 
native state of Maryland. 




Scientist developes process for blood plasma 



Dr. Charles Drew 
1904-1950 

Dr. Charles Drew made one of the most impor- 
tant single contributions to the Allied victory in 
World War II. A doctor and scientist, he devel- 
oped a process of changing blood into plasma. 
This important discovery has saved many thou- 
sands of lives each year since 1940. 

Born in Washington, D.C, in 1904, Charles 
Drew combined self-discipline, work and intelli- 
gence to earn honors in everything he did. An 
excellent student, he also performed well in many 
sports. While he was a student at Amherst 
College, he earned national recognition as a half- 
back. At graduation time, he was chosen as the 
student who had brought the greatest honor to the 
college. 

In 1950 he died from loss of blood, after an 
automobile accident.

STAFF EDITORIAL 

Yellow Journalism 
shows its ugly head 



With the 1994 Olympics well underway, we have been 
subjected to one of the most highly publicized media event 
in Olympic History with the Tonya Harding/Nancy 
Kerrigan face-off beginning February 23 and 25. 

Tonya Harding had to file a $25 million lawsuit against 
the U.S. Olympic Committee in order to be allowed to per- 
form in the Olympics. 

The USOC has to deal with a legal and ethical question 
regarding an athelete's conduct. 

Anyone who has the determination and skill has a right 
to participate in the games as it is a culmination of a life- 
time of hardwork, sacrifice, in combination with the physi- 
cal pain an athlete must endure through years of practice. 

But what price has to be paid in the name of fairness in 
athletic competion. 

Harding deserves to attend the Olympics until her 
involvement can be determined, but she also deserves a 
gold medal in the "winning at all costs category". 

With all of the legal maneuvers performed by Harding 
and her attorneys, the United States Olympic Committee 
will be revising rulings on eligibility. 

Both skaters stand to receive financial gains from this 
controversy, but the public will have received nothing from 
this. 

Let us hope that in the next few weeks, the media 
overkill from the 1994 Winter Olympics will quickly fade 
from our memory. 

Nothing will happen when the two skate this week, but 
the real battle begins afterwards when the USOC and 
Harding's attorneys meet once again in the courts. 

We would prefer to remember the accomplishments of 
speedskater Dan Jansen, or women's alpine skiier Picabo 
Street, or of the fighting Bosnians escaping from their 
homeland in order to compete.

Letters to the editor 

Student describes editorial as 'history with an attitude' 



To the Editor: 

In response to the editorial 
"Somclhing in the Milk Ain't 
While." of Feb 17ih. you are guilty 
of what I call doing "History with 
an attitude " As History major, I am 
taught to look at the events of histo- 
ry as objectively as possible within 
the context of ihe mindset of the 
times, free of imposing my agen- 
das, and not imposing today's val- 
ues in order to judge yesterday's 
events. This, while an elusive goal, 
is a worthwhile goal nonetheless. 

I guess I don't sec the value in 
beating ourselves up over things we 
were not responsible for. Columbus 
and his "White make Europeans" 
caused genocide lo the indigenous 
population. George Washington 
owned slaves. Did I ever kill a 
Native American? Did I ever own a 
black man? Did you? Of course not. 
I have screwed up plenty of things 
in my lifeiimc-for those I take full 
responsibility, but I refuse lo feel 
guilt and remorse for the sins of my 
father, grandfather, or any of my 
ancestors. Just as I wouldn't expect 
my son to someday wring his hands 
over my misdeeds. 

You also made the common 
assumption in history that a per- 
son's misdeeds somehow forever 
invalidate whatever good they 
accomplish in their lifetime, or 
those that come after. George 
Washington owned slaves; sad, but 
true. He also was part of forming 
the most unique system of govern- 
ment that the world has ever, or 
will ever see-onc from which you 



reap tremendous benefits Perfect ' 
No freakin way! But one in which 
the mechanisms were put in place 
for later reform. Is this achievement 
invalidated by Washin^'inn's slave 
owning? Do Ihe sins of Columbus 
invalidate what-ever good has been 
accomplished in 500 years of the 
western hemisphere? 

If that is the case, we're going lo 
have to search through history to 
honor only the truly virtuous ones 
we find Moses? Nope, killed a man 
in his youth. Plato? Uh-Uh, Dad 
news. Luther? Chuck that 
Reformation thing, he was an anti- 
semile. Churchill? Let's not forget 
that Gallipoli , screw up. Martin 
Luther? Forget thai whole Civil 
Rights stuff, he slept around and 
cheated on his wife. If there's one 
thing I've learned about history, its 
that it is made by fallible people 
who sometimes accomplish extraor- 
dinary things. There's only one 
person 1 know of in history 
found to be truly virtuous, and 
even he was accused of being the 
friend of "thieves, prostitutes, and 
tax collectors," 

Do you want your life to be 
judged by this standard? Suppose 
your friends called you up one day 
and said "Well, wc were going to 
throw you a birthday party, but 
when we all got to writing down all 
the screwups you've made in the 
past, we decided after getting lo 
page 50, that you don't deserve a 
birthday party- Oh, and Ihe Native 
Americans called, and they said 
you should pack up your newspaper 
office that's sitting on stolen Native 



American land, and slop using their 
trees to prim their editorials vising 
"We've stolen Native American 
land; and get off the continent!" 

It is sad to read about the geno- 
cide of Native Americans and the 
horrible abuses of slavery in 
America. It was terrible li was very 
wrong. 8ut let's not use"selcciive 
memory" on these peoples either 
Africans fought wars and enslaved 
one another, (often selling ihem to 
white slave traders) and life 
amongst the Native Americans was 
not More's Utopia, either-especial- 
ly in South America. This doesn't 
justify what was done to them, it's 
just they are not the virtuous people 
we want them to be anymore than 
George Washington. 

What arc we going to use our 
knowledge of history for anyway? 
To beat, ourselves up with guilt for 
things wc had no hand in? Or 
maybe, just maybe, to leam from 
their failures-and (heir triumphs? 
History gives us roots, but, it also 
has to give us wings? I hate to write 
the following statement for the 
furor it will cause, but as long as 
anyone blames their failures on 
"White male Europeans" pushin'em 
down throughout history, they will 
reap nothing but despair, bitterness, 
and more societal fragmentation. 
History has taught me dial life is 
always tough, always unfair, and 
it's easy to scapegoat everything on 
faceless generalizations such as 
"White Male Europeans," instead 
of tackling today's troubles and 
challenges today. 

I'm a white male European, 



trkrainian by ancestry tl ui lime I 
checked, I'm not Satan, either.) I 
cannot get ahead in life because ol 
Stalin and his siinkin' Communists 
starving my people. Then there 
were those stupid Nazis' atrocities 
to my brothers. Let's not forget 
those blasted Mongol Hordes rap- 
ing and pillaging my homeland Oh. 
and the Tartars, and the Turks! Not 
to mention my ancestors were ter- 
rorized forever by lhat stupid Indo- 
European migration about 5000 
DC! I never had a chance! 1 haie'tn 
all! - Now, doesn't that sound 
ridiculous? Aren't centuries of bit- 
terness what's causing the troubles 
in Balkans loday? Is that what we 
want in America? Let it go! Let's 
work together to solve today's 
problems today! 

So on Fori Wayne's 200th, I will 
celebrate the things that arc com- 
mon to all human experience, 
growing up , falling in love, hold- 
ing my son in my arms when he 
cries, getting older, and yes, dying. 
It's happy; It's sad. As Solomon 
said "To everything there is a 
Season" (Or was that the Dyrds?) I 
will not practice "selective memo- 
ry" to only recall all that was bad 
aboui the last 200 years, nor will I 
gloss over the loss of the Native 
Americans of this area. I will reap 
the benefits of such locals as Philo 
Famsworth and An Smith and shed 
a tear for Chief Little Turtle, but I 
will not take credit for or bear Ihe 
blame for any of it-lhat was done 
long ago.

Editorial resembles an intellectual hillbilly 



To the editor: 

I have to admit being a little sur- 
prised at F. Lane Dousc's rejoinder, 
published in the Feb. 17 issue of The 
Communicalor, to my letter to ihe 
editor, printed the week before. 
Desides admitting to writing the 
original editorial. Douse compounds 
the problem by attempting to defend 
it. Again, I was surprised. If I wrote 
that badly, I wouldn't want anyone 
to know about it. 

The Feb. 17 article took on a 
numbingly predictable cast. In the 
fashion of today's disputations, in 
which discernment is proportional to 
one's victimization. Douse wraps 
himself in the role of Supreme 
Victim, and then not-so-sublly sug- 
gests that all who dissent from his 
viewpoint are racisis. I won't even 
attempt to compare my situation 
with Douse's-hc wins hands down. 
Evidently traumatized by being "fol- 
lowed in stores," he is unable to rea- 
son logically, analyze arguments, or 
write a rational apologetic, symp- 
toms with which I fortunately am 
not afflicted. To wit: 

1. Douse continues to subordinate 
Christ's teaching to his race by 
insisting that Christ is "depicted as a 
man of color in a passage of the 
Bible." The passage Douse quoted, 
Is3iah 53. says nothing about the 
color of Christ, only thai he was 
"despised and rejected of men," 
which to Douse is indisputable 
proof. But this verse no more proves 
the color of Jesus than a description 
of a Rich Young Ruler in the Gospel 
"proves" the Ruler to be white. 
Douse's exegesis wouldn't pass 
muster in die most elementary semi- 
nary Hermeneuties course. Douse 
finds it "hard to believe that Jesus 
was white man with red hair." So do 
I, but the only person talking about a 



white Jesus is Douse, not me. Jesus 
was an ordinary first century Jew. If 
this is what Douse means by "man 
of color," I would have to agree, 
except that Douse clearly endorsed 
the notion of a black Jesus in his 
original article, and no amount of 
sophistry on his part can change that 
fact. 

2. Douse, however now has larger 
problem to contend with. The book 
of Isaiah was written several cen- 
turies before the birth of Chris. 
Since Douse apparently believes thai 
Isaiah 53 is a description of Jesus. 
he must therefore believe that God 
speaks prophetically through the 
writers of Scripture. Here's the 
problem: Several times, both in the 
Old Testament and the New, the 
Bible forbids homosexual relation- 
ships, the same types of relation- 
ships Douse defends in his article. 
On what basis does Douse believe in 
Scripture that purportedly supports 
his position (which it doesn't) and 



reject Scripture that disagrees with 
him? Theologians have a term for 
this. It is called a "mistake." 

3. More ominously, Douse 
remarks lhat a statement of mine 
saddens him"because it show how 
people continue to project their own 
personal demons on to other people 
because their opinion is different 
from the so called status quo." 
There's a particular irony to this 
statement, coming as it does on 
the heels of a sub literate, 
Rumplestiltskin-tantrum editorial, 
cryptically titles "Something in the 
Milk Ain't While," published the 
same day. Here, the writer, assum- 
ing a ludicrous posiure of self-right- 
eousness, denigrates the memory of 
one of America's mosi revered 
icons, George Washington, and 
exalts a supposed contribution of die 
Iroquois Confederation to the U. S. 
Constitution. Of course, the 
Constitution is an amalgamation of 
Judeo-Christian ethics, Greek 



Rationalism, Roman, Reformation, 

and Enlightenment influences. Any 
influence by the Iroquois would be 
negligible, certainly not "huge" as 
the writer claims. The writer relates 
that the '88 Congress took some 
time oul from running up a 4 trillion 
dollar deficit to recognize this "con- 
tribution." I can only remark that 
Congress has gone, and will always 
continue to do, ridiculous things. 
My point is that the self-esteem of 
blacks will never be served by 
attacks on the Founders or bizarre 
historical lie. The real tragedy is that 
ihe writer of this editorial may actu- 
ally receive a diploma, an iherefore 
the mantle, of an educated person, 
when ii clearly is not merited. I 
wouldn't go so far as to call the 
writer an intellectual hillbilly, but 
you have lo admit the resemblance 
is remarkable.

Parking Proposal hits the pockets of students 



To the Editor: 

I am so tired of this stupid parking proposal. Why 
don't we just give all of our money. Would they be 
happy then? Raising the price parking permits is the 
same as raising our tuition. I feel lhat parking 
should be free n the first place. We already drain 
our wallets enough as it is It's about time that the 
students stand up and fight this nonsense. 

This parking proposal has a bad effect on students. 
Think about it. The students who take more credit 
hours will pay more. Thai's like being punished for 
going to school So in the long run. students will 
stan taking less credit hours. If they take less hours, 
it will take longer lo graduate, therefore giving 
1PFW more money. Why does it seem like every 
change lhat happens at IPFW has to deal with get- 




ling more money? Why can't ihe students benefit 
for once? I'm jusl tired of forking out more and 
more money and getting nowhere. 

If 1 had my way, there would be assigned parking. 
By the way. does anyone know how many parking 
spaces there arc compared to the total number of 
cars transporting lo IPFW? I'm sure you could find 
oul if you paid the Info office a couple of bucks 
Getting back to my point, if there were enough 
spaces, wc could have our owd spot. This would 
eliminate coming to school early to park. Also, ihe 
spots could be assigned by the number of credit 
hours you are taking or your year in college. So the 
people who only lake a few credit hours and the 
freshman can park in the back. So I say 
"ASSIGNED PARKING" all the way.

A mart of tremendous inventive talents. Granville T. Woods 
was called in 1888 "the greatest electrician in the world," by 
the "American Catholic Tribune." He is best known for his 
invention of an automatic air brake. 

When he was a boy of ten, he worked at bellows blowing in 
an Australian railroad repair shop. With his extra earnings, he 
paid a master mechanic to give him private instruction 

Mr. Woods' parents brought him to America at the age of 
sixteen. He held various jobs as an engineer. 

About thirty-five patents in various countries were taken out 
by Granville Woods. He contributed to the development of the 
"third rail." He also invented devices which he sold to Bell, 
Edison and Westinghouse. Most of his designs were in the 
field of improvements in the railroad and electrical industries.

Editorial shows courage 



Tolht Editor: 

U-i mc applaud you for your stir- 
ring editorial in lasl week's issue. 
My congratulations to ihe person 
who wrote it, showing as ii does not 
only sensitivity and insight, but 
courage as well. In the answers to 
your questions — "Arc we rejoicing 
and celebrating the fact ibal Ihe 
Native Americans were robbed of 
ihcir land '...Why should George 
Washington, a person who partici- 
pated in the selling and profiteering 
of other human beings, continue to 
be celebrated as a great figure in 
history?' 

Well, the answers arc sadly, yes, 
and because he made a fortune. I 
used to think that the mentality in 
Fort Wayne, and all across this 
great land o[ ours, was due to igno- 
rance . and I look it upon myself to 
try and educate the public. Boy, talk 
about ignorance. My own. People 
know the facts and they're proud of 
them. Proud, otherwise why would 
there be a big statue of Anthony 
Wayne in a downtown park? Why 
would a man who wrote a letter 
about what a shame it is to clean up 
the statue receive the morning's 
paper award as Letter of the 
Month? Why docs die city still bear 
ihe name of Anthony Wayne, a mad 
general who bumed down the crops 



of the savagesfand we whites of 
course are civilized) in order to 
starve them into submission? After 
he conquered the Indians, he mod- 
estly changed the name here 
from Kekionga to Fort Wayne. And 
why does the city continue to show 
such pride in the Old Fort, which 
stands as a symbol of greed and 
brutality? 

Why is a main street downtown 
named after George Ewing, a Fori 
Wayne businessman who made his 
fortune in part by exploiting Ihe 
poor Indian in his hour of greatest 
need? You sec, it wasn't only reser- 
vations we so gracefully estab- 
lished, we removed the Indian by 
force form their homelands to far 
and distant places oui west. In the 
process of course many died. Those 
doing the removing wore the 
insignia of ihe United States of 
America on Ihcir sleeves, and 
received awards for doing so. Here 
in Indiana, hundreds of Polawatomi 
died, mostly children, on a little 
nature hike come to be known as 
ihe Trail of Death, in which they 
were rounded up like catde while 
attending mass on Sunday morning 
(convening to the black robe's reli- 
gion certainly did "save" them) and 
marched-on foot — at gun point out 
to Kansas, from Plymouth Indiana. 
A chief who refused to sign submis- 



sion papers was carted around 
through the town in a cage 

And Mr. Ewing was contracted 
by the government of the United 
Stales of America to provide to 
food for these poor souls, the 
Indian, is quoted as saying "At six 
dollars per head we should make 
out handsomely." (on the removal 
of the Indians.) He made his fortune 
and now he's a hero as is any rich 
person, no matter how the money is 
earned. (Consider for example, Lcc 
laccoca. whose Ford Pinto burned 
human beings lo death when it was 
hit from the rear and Lee chose to 
hire lawyers to fight law suits rather 
than to fin ihe problem because it 
was cheaper. He's now and 
American icon.) 

What dire punishments did the 
soldiers receive for their part in 
these marches? Well Co. Tipton, in 
charge of the removal at Plymouth. 
gets a town named after him. and 
he's given all the land in what we 
now as West Central here in 
Anthony's town as a reward. 

For those of you who are not 
mired in mediocrity and manifest 
destiny. 1 invite you to join us this 
Monday. Feb. 28 at 7 PM at the 
YWCA for a program on Indian 
history from the Indian point of 
view.

Historical 
revisionism 

Tolherdilor: 

I see that the horrible monstei 
of political correctness and his- 
torical revisionism is alive and 
well at the Communicator. Your 
recent editorial is little short of 
ridiculous. You ask. "are we cel- 
ebrating the fact that Native 
Americans were mhtvd of their 
land, thai we look away people's 
homes and cultures. that George 
Washington sold people as mere 
cattle ..that he participated in rap- 
ing people of the culture and their 
bodies? The answer is NO and it 
is simply SILLY lo suggest oth- 
erwise. If you can not figure our 
why Washington's birthday is 
celebrated then you are sadly 
lacking in an understanding of 
the historical and political reali- 
ties of our history. Yes it is true 
that he owned slaves, as did the 
Iroquois, the Egyptians, the 
Aztecs, the Romans, etc. 

As for celebrating the Iroquois, 
perhaps you should check with 
the Hurons about that. Hard to 
find a Huron you say? Well that 
irue. The Iroquois nearly wiped 
them out and ihcy, like many 
Native American groups, had 
cultures that glorified war, tor 
lure, rape and theft. Of course 
some people will excuse them by 
saying that's the way things were 
done then but that does not justi- 
fy the act of killing and torturing 
another HUMAN BEING.

Student informed on other teams at IPFW 



To Ihe Editor: 

I am writing this letter in regard 
to the editorial you wrote, "More to 
Sports Than Volleyball." I want to 
strongly express my agreement with 
you. I feel that the volleyball team 
deserves the media coverage, the 
community support, and all Ihe 
appreciation it receives because of 
the money it brings in. But 1 do 
believe that other sports that are 
played at IPFW should also receive 
the media coverage, the community 
support, and the appreciation of the 



money they bring in. 

When I read in Ihe article about 
the women's volleyball team win- 
ning the Great lakes Volleyball 
Tournament, and the Men's basket- 
ball team wining it's championship. 
I was surprised. 1 have never heard 
of these winnings, let alone the 
women's cross country team doing 
ihe best ever in the history of 
IPFW. But when the men's volley- 
ball team played UCLA it was 
broadcasted on prime time T.V. 

Every student that plays on a 
sports team needs to be rewarded 



because of all the lime and energy 
put into the spon. The students not 
only put in time for the team but 
also have to put in plenty of time 
for ihcir academics. Whal these 
players need is for the community 
to back them. I strongly agree that 
the community plays a very large 
role in building a winning learn. 
Every team needs someone to root 
them on. I want to close by saying 
that the volleyball team does play 
an important part and deserves all 
the credit, but all the other sports 
need to be recognized just as well.

A voice from generation x 



by Edward Granzella Jr 
Staff Columnist 

1 have a hard time imagining any- 
one who doesn'i love the Olympics. 
Sure you're missing out on some 
decent CBS programs, which some 
may prefer. To those people, I can 
only say, "get a life". The Olympics 
arc a rare occasion for everyone to 
have no division of loyalties. You 
root for the USA all ihe way. even 
if you haven'i a clue about what 
makes for a good performance in 
those events not normally seen on 
ihe boob tube. 



The opening day ceremonies can 
sometimes give a clue about how 
the games are going to go. These 
ceremonies were particularly dra- 
matic this year, since the skier they 
picked to long jump the Olympic 
torch into the stadium fell on a 
practice run a couple of days prior 
to the actual event and injured him- 
self You know all the organizers 
had their fingers crossed when the 
substitute jumper started his descent 
down the ski ramp. 

Another major concern was the 
reindeer they had pulling sleds at 
one point in the opening ceremony. 



Apparently, there was a problem in 
ihe practice sessions with the deer 
trying to make a break for freedom. 
As a precaution, people were sta- 
tioned ai each exit lo cul off any 
escape attempt. To my disappoint- 
ment, none made the attempt. I 
would have enjoyed seeing a 
wresding match between a gang of 
Norwegians and a crazed reindeer. 

The big story of these Winter 
Olympics is, of course, the Tonya 
Harding/Nancy Kerrigan saga.

A Dose of Douse 



Administrators, students, professors need to commit to diversity 



Recently, 1 had a chance lo listen 
lo Juliiinnc Malvcaux, an African - 
American economist and King 
Feature! Syndicate columnist, in a 
panel discussion on multicultural 
education 

Malvcaux's visit on campus wis 
a part of the ongoing faculty and 
staff cultural diversity workshops 
sponsored by the Chancellor's 
Council on Minority Recruitment 
and Retention 

I left the discussion with a wealth 
of knowledge hut also disgusted 
and appalled at not only the turnout 
of the students but also professors, 
faculty, and administrators on 
campus. 

Now, 1 wholeheartedly under- 
stand that some professors were 
participating in (he cultural diversi- 
ty workshop during the panel dis- 
cussion, leaching classes, and 
attending meetings of importance 
regarding this university. 

I understand that. 

What 1 don't understand is how 
people expect things lo change 
around this campus when our own 
administrators, professors, and stu- 
dents arc not participating in activi- 
ties that arc designed to address the 
issues? 

I do not understand how tilings 
arc going to change when Uic peo- 
ple who make the key decisions on 
this campus arc not taking part and 
getting an education they need. You 
can take that last remark any which 

Commentary - 

Students need to wake up 



way you want ti&gt;. Where were the 
i ■■ ■■tin crs ol Jludcnl gov- 
ernment? Oh, yes. lerry, Mark, 
Mclinda, and Mike I am tailing you 


I don't process how you people 
can fund an event using Indiana- 
1'urdue Student Ciovernmcnt 
Association money and not attend. 

Yet, ynu guys want to get furious 
over the parking situation but not 
iii.it deal specifically 
with the social conditions of this 
university. I suggest readers take 
their actions into consideration 
when these people run for office 
lata on this semester. 

Where were the deans of the 
schools, department chairs, and 
directors of various studies (besides 
the Women's Studies and Career 
Services Directors).' 

It's sickening when Joanne D. 
LantZ, the chancellor of the univer- 
sity, has only attended one of the 
sessions, II she were really com- 
mitted to the issue of diversity, she 
would have been there if only in the 
flesh. However, according to the 
secretary, she's always out of town. 

Let's not single the chancellor 
out. Her co-chairs Vice-Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Frank Borelli 
and Vice-Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Michael Wartcll have 
attended one out of the three 
workshops held. One out of three 
ain't bad! 

Naturally, I bad to talk to Dr. 



by Ramnna Mcgown 
Editor In chief 

In the majority of the commen- 
taries and articles that I have writ- 
ten, 1 really tried to be as profes- 
sional as possible. I have also tried 
to utilize and manipulate the 
English language to the best of my 
ability. The last couple of Letters to 
the Editor and comments that I 
have heard on campus have 
enraged me. Since it appears that 
some of these persons have chosen 
to have a Dumb ass attack or are 
just plain ignorant, 1 would like to 
take out lime to break a few things 



down for you. (For Uiose of you 
thai do not know what I am talking 
aboul, I mean EXPLAIN.) Yes. 1 
am aboul to go there. (GO OFF and 
tell it like it is!) 

It is amazing how upset and philo- 
sophical persons become, when the 
truth is put before them. Sorry 
folks, the "history that is taught in 
our education system is not right 
history its the WHITE MAN'S 
HISTORY. 

Now to address Mr. Roman: Yes, 
I am a bit bitter and somewhat 
pissed off that the only references

Borelli before 1 began to dissect bis 
actions, lie of course was the only 
representative from the administra- 
tion at the panel discussion who 
had committed an hour to this event 
because he had an appointment. 

Now, 1 didn't ask him what type 
of appointment he had to attend 
because that is not any of my busi- 
ness. 1 just think that his actions are 
not consistent with his statement in 
that appeared in the Feb. 17 issue of 
the News Sentinel, "From the very 
beginning our intent was to sensi- 
tize the entire university communi- 
ty to what it's like to be a part of 
the environment and not be part of 
the majority." 

It Borelli goes on lo mention in 
the article that cultural diversity 
training is not mandatory for the 
faculty and staff on campus. 

Even on this issue he (old me that 
if people were forced to attend a 
workshop like this it would cause 
people to close their minds to the 
issue. 

■'People arc far more open if it is 
done by their choice," Borelli said. 

But. I submit if people really 
wanted "to sensitize the university 
community" Ihcy would make 
workshops like this diversity one 
mandatory. Now that shows corn- 
mi uncnt to an issue. 

If the chancellor and her vice- 
chancellors are not taking an active 
role by participating in the diversity 
workshops, how do they expect 



anyone else to show up? Believe it 
or not, people watch their so called 
leaders. 

This is what I'm talking aboul, 
the lack of commitment to impor- 
tant social issues on this campus. 
And "you people" are considered 
by some students and members of 
the Fori Wayne community as our 
"leaders." 

Webster defines the word lead as 
to guide by influence or to show the 
way as by going before. If these so- 
called leaders on campus are going 
to behave in a manner of not 
attempting to take an interest in 
issues such as the cultural diversity 
workshops, why even have the 
workshops? 

I believe it is one thing to fund a 
program and another lo show an 
interest in it. Funding is important, 
but not as important as receiving 
and communicating ihc message to 
other folks. 

It is a waste of time, especially if 
the people who need to be there 
aren't participating. 

It all boils down to the old saying, 
"Actions speak louder than words." 

I think the actions of the "leader- 
ship" on this campus have sent a 
loud message lo the university com- 
munity on how committed they arc 
in sensitizing the community to the 
issue of diversity.

Q. What are the benefits of storing my own blood 
for surgery? 

A. Using your own stored blood, regardless of your age, 
is safer and healthier than using the blood of a family 
member or unknown volunteer. You will have less 
chance of a reaction, and the healing process is faster. 
Also, if you are on prescribed medications, the blood 
level of the medications will be maintained. 

Q. How can I make arrangements for storing my 
blood? 

A. You will need a prescription from your physician. Your 
physician will determine if you need packed red cells, 
which can be stored for 42 days, or whole blood, which 
can be stored for 35 days prior to surgery. The cost per 
unit of autologous blood (donated for yourself) is about 
S I 07 to S I I 5 in our region. The cost for a family 
member to donate and store blood is slightly higher due 
to required blood tests. The Red Cross bills the hospital, 
and the cost is then passed on to you. Most insurance 
companies will reimburse you for the cost of storing your 
own blood but not a family member's; studies show 
blood from an unknown volunteer is as safe as that from 
a family member. 

These answers are based on information from the Allen-Wells 
Chapter ol the American Red Cross.

in most history books of African- 
Americans are as follows: Martin 
Luther King. Rosa Parks, and our 
infamous slaves. This somewhat 
makes me upset. As one professor 
previously stated " Without black 
history, there is no history." 

Then I am told to grow up and 
live in today's limes. Well to that 1 
say "Pardon me but DAMN." Since 
when is it that the average white 
male has had to deal with the 
REALITIES of what most African- 
Americans go through I am talking 
about getting your asses beat 
because well you happen to be in 
the wrong neighborhood, or 
stopped in your cars arid accused of 
being a drug dealer on the fact that 
"Your car looks awfully new and 



nice." and the fact that loo often 
African-Americans are assumed to 
be unintelligent because of the 
color of their skin. 

These are the realities of 1994! 
No it is no longer slavery in effect, 
but coven racism that is alive and 
well. Excuse me. Mr. Gwaltncy. 
but what in the bell is an intellectu- 
al hillbilly? I am sorry, I have never 
met any. 

I am astounded at people who will 
be the firsi lo support those who 
produces movies, write books, and 
often are interviewed about (he 
Holocaust. Yet. when African- 
Americans discuss the 
misrepresentation and grievances of 
their people, they arc seen as whin- 
ing and revising hisiory. 

When I siaied misrepresentation 
before, I am referring to the unfor- 
tunate characterization that some 
white Americans choose to identify 
with African-Americans. I am 



describing the three Fs-Fucking. 
Fighting, and Fbot-ndng. Oh yeah, 
don't lei me forget SINGING. 
When African- Amcri cans speak out 
against these characierizaiiotu, wt 
are not being good litdc house nig- 
gas. How dare we coloretls noi sing 
and rejoice in the wonderful 
RIGHTS that the constitution did 
not intend for us in the first place. 

Oh yeah, for the hisiory major 
who eloquently explains lo me how 
I should not discredit OLD 
George's accomplishments and has 
the nerve to characterize his owning 
and raping of slaves with "MAK- 
ING A MISTAKE," 1 say Don't go 
there! ( This means do not compare 
apples with oranges) 

Washington did not mistakenly 
own other human beings and profit 
from them. He chose to DO THIS! 
There is a difference. LOCKING 
YOUR KEYS IN YOUR CAR IS 
A MISTAKE! 



Student needs to get 
head on straight 




Dear Aunt 
Louise, 

Why arc peo- 
ple so phony 
and fake? Why 
can't people 
just be legiti- 
mate and 
straightforward 
instead of 
always playing 
games? I just don't understand why 
people hide ihcir true feelings 
instead of facing them. I have met 
so many shallow people in my life 
lhat I'm beginning lo think that all 
people arc like lhat. 

Am I right or just looking in the 
wrong places? 

Sincerely, 
Being True to Myself 

Dear Being True lo Myself, 

Look, missy, you need to gel 
your head out of the sand. Not all 
people are shallow and fake. There 
are some good, clean, moral folk in 
this big ol' world like mc. Your 
problem is thai you haven't met 
those types of people yet. 

What you need to do is go lo 
places you have never been and 
meel new people. Broaden your 
horizons and get your head out of 
the clouds. You need to find a nice 
church. Good, clean, moral folk arc 
what you'll find there. Just contin- 



ue to be true to yourself and things 
will work out for the best. 

Your loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

Oh, girlfriend. I read your col- 
umn every day and just love it. You 
remind me so much of "On the 
Phone with Tyrone!" Anyway, I 
have a problem. 

I jusi met Ihis guy out at this 
party. And he jusi wants loo much 
from mc. We hardly know each 
other and he wants lo spend lois of 
lime wilh me and such. I don't 
know how to tell him that I am only 
interested in a friendship and I 
don't know how to do thai Should 
I just continue lo aci like every- 
thing is okay. 

Or tell htm the truth? 

Sincerely, 
Just Wnnt to be Friends 

Dear Just Want to be Friends, 

Look, darling! What you need to 
do is tell homeboy how you feel. 
You should never lie to him. In all 
Ihc years I have been married to my 
loving porkchop Dorcus I have 
never lied. I wouldn't hear of it 
because honesly is a big part of 
relationships with anyone on this 
planet. 
So, just tell him like it is. 

Your loving Aunt Louise 



Generation X 

continued from pg. 3 

Although I am a big fan of pretty women in 
skimpy clothing, I'm not really fond of figure 
skating as a sport and I like men's figure skat- 
ing about as much as I like men's ballet or a 
root canal. The scoring is loo subjective in fig- 
ure skating. In the past, I've seen performances 
which included the infamous triple butt plant 
that still received a decent score. In lhat respeel, 
it's very similar to the most bogus of all sports, 
boxing. 
Still, you have to be eagerly awaiting the start 



of women's figure skating, whether you're a fan 
or not. I believe lhat it was Jeff Gillooly and the 
bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt, who masterminded 
the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. Just from their 
bravado and ovcrprotective demeanor, ii seems 
very likely lhat these two mentally-defunct 
leeches would try something to increase the 
chances Tonya Harding had to make ii to 
Lillehammcr. Tonya had, at best, an ancillary 
role in the plot. Although Tonya is not com- 
pletely without blame. Her belief thai nol being 
charged with a crime somehow equates with 
acting in the best spirit of sportsmanship, as the 
Olympics are intended, is noi correct. If the U.S. 
Olympic Committee or the U.S. Figure Skating 
Association had acted a litde less chicken-heart- 
ed, the majority of ihis story would be over. 



They had every right lo remove her from the 
team. 

But. 1 think everyone is missing Ihe bigger 
Issue - the new decline of quality in American 
workmanship. This guy. Shane Slant, gets paid 
thousands of dollars lo disable Nancy Kerrigan. 
So, he whacks her on the leg. Two weeks bier, 
she's back doing double axles on the ice. If 
Shane didn't gel arrested, I'd be asking for my 
money back, or at least try to gel him to do the 
job right. He must have been a wimp. Definitely 
not Italian. Did you sec Ihe movie. " The 
Untouchables"? Now, Al Capone could really 
swing a club. I would actually pay money to 
see Al demonstrate on Gillooly how it's done 
properly. 



Poignard 

continued from pg. 



As far as what she has accom- 
plished in the pasi seven years, 
Poignard feels mat when she leaves 
it will be better than what it was 
before. 

"What I want lo do is leave it bel- 
ter that how I found it. That is not 
to be critical of the person before 
mc because I firmly believe people 
do what they can at the lime," 
Poignard commented.

Professor discusses sports gender bias 



The Anthropology Club present- 
ed a discussion entitled Theorizing 
Gender on Tuesday. Feb. 16 at 6 
p.m. in CM 116. 

David Fairchild. chair or the phi- 
losophy department discussed 
Peggy Mcintosh's interaciivc phase 
theory for approaching the study of 
gender in our society, with special 
emphasis on eliminating gender 
bias and discrimination in sports. 

Fairchild presenied this model as 
it applied lo sports theory of excel- 
lence In Ihc interaciivc model, 
there are five phases. 
Phase One is known as "womanless 
sport." Fairchild used an illustra- 
tion of peak pinnacle theory, where 
a man's record of excellence would 
be recognized at the peak. 

Fairchild's examples are based on 
the first male to run a mile, the first 
to win four gold medals in a single 
Olympics, or the first man to climb 
Mount Everest, etc. 

An example he provided as evi- 
dence was Ihc 1992 Summer 
Olympic men's basketball team and 
the attention paid lo the "Dream 
Team," Much atlcntion was paid lo 
ten pro players and two collegiate 
players who were treated to inter- 
views and media attention. All 
men's games, but none of the 
women's games were televised. 
The only media atlcntion the 
women's games received were on 
the late news. 

After the games were over the 
American public was asked, "What 
was Ihe single most memorable 
moment of the games?" and Ihe 
answer was the men's basketball 
team winning the gold medal. 

"Gail Devers, who won an 
Olympic medal in the 100-meter 
dash, was rated fourth and that was 
the highest ranking women's 
achievement, the women's basket- 
ball team was not listed at all," said 
Fairchild. 

Noi only do women not reach the 
peaks, but their absence is not even 
noted when people construct the 
hierarchies at which excellence is 
measured. 



If women are interested in sports, 
they are likely lobe socialized to fit 
in ways in which sports excellence 
is not expected- They may become 
baseball wives, cheerleaders, or 
members of booster clubs. Women 
are not expected to seek out excel- 
lence in Iheir physical selves Ihe 
same way in which men are. 

Fairchild argues that men arc 
expected to develop a sense of 
physical accomplishment at a very 
young age and women arc denied 
that opportunity in Phase One 
cultures. 

In Phase Two there is some 
progress. There are some women in 
sport, but not many. 

Women in Phase Three achieve 
some success on male terms. Most 
academic sporls and professional 
sports are on this level. "Women 
overall are not expected to have 
athletic success, but when they do it 
is looked upon as competing for 
issues such as gender equity, or 
because "Tide 9" demands that 
women have these opporiunities. 
Women arc not appreciated as 
striving after the same goals that 
men strive for. In our eullure today, 
most of us are in Phase Three," said 
Fairchild. 

Phase Four is a more positive 
phase. As sports begins to focus on 
stories of ordinary people (mostly 
women) at levels below peaks of 
excellence. 

"The majority of the population 
is found here — leading very ordi- 
nary lives," said Fairchild. 

Fairchild says the answer to this 
question is not to ask how women 
have achieved success in sport, but 
how women have used sport. 

Phase Four moves away from the 
vertical masculine structures that 
occur in the fust three phases and 
sets up what occurs in Phase Five. 

"Phase Five Sport is reconstituted 
lo include all of us. The sport that 
receives primary culture value, 
such as football, perpetuates nega- 
tive value characters, force and vio- 
lence," said Fairchild. 

The average career in pro football 
is 3.7 years with 100 percent of pro 
football players ending their careers 
with permanent injury. 



"We need to find sports that 
include the average person. This 
can change, but only over a period 
of time," said Fairchild. 

He says the public can find ways 
to re-identify our sport goals, 
defining a fluid rule that constitutes 
equality and fairness. 

He used as an example a husband 
and wife playing racquetball more 
fairly if a right-handed male uses 
the racquet with his left hand. 

"If we expect sports to become a 
more social forum, we can change 
if it we choose to do so," said 
Fairchild. 

We can change it individually or 
what we do with others, and we can 
change over a period of lime sys- 
tematically, culturally and socially 
as well. 

Fairchild suggests society should 
allow people to compete at their 
own level and refrain from using 
the pinnacle theory.
