Franke calls for SAAB abolishment 

The immediate and unconditional abolishment of the Student 
Activities Advisory Board has been called for by Student Body 
President Mark Franke. In a memorandum sent to Dean Ulmer, who 
has been commissioned by Dean Kanges to study the feasibility of 
retaining the Board, Franke criticized the S^AB for its failure 
to meet for better than six months. 

Franke said that the result of this failure to meet has caused 
unnecessary delay in the approval of five Student Senate appro- 
priations bills, 

Franke also questioned the legitimacy of the Board. "It can 
in no way be legitimate for a joint student-faculty appointed 
board to' exercise the power of veto over the duly elected rep- 
resentatives of the students. The value judgements as to spend- 
ing of the Activity Fee monies should begin and end with the 
student Senate." 

A resolution urging the abolishment of the SAAB has been sub- 
mitted to the Senate by Franke and is now being studied. 






Senate views guidelines, 
adopts constitutions 

The eighteenth meeting of 
the Student Senate opened un- 
der the gavel of Senate Pres- 
ident Like Rotlveb. 

Resolution 7172-I-iPi, calling 
for the abolition of tha Stu- 
dent Activity Advisory Board 
was assigned to the Appropria- 
tions Committee. The resolu- 
tion suggests that all func- 
tions handled by the board be 
delegated to the btudent 
Senate. 

Senate Bill 7172-16, esta- 
blishing guidelines for the 
utilization of extra income 
generated from student acti- 
vities, was also sent to the 
Appropriations Committee. 

Constitutions of two 
campus organizations were 
adopted. 1 si Alpha Diganma 
Fraternity, a conservative 
social organization, and the 
Disabled Students' Organi- 
zation, were adopted while 
amendments to the Nursing 
Students' Constitution and 
the Speech and Hearing Club 
were also approved. 

Exprersing disapproval of 
the plan to reinstate the 
former academic calendar, 
the Senate urged the imple- 
mentation of the present 
71-72 calendar for the next 
school year. 

Supplementary funds for 
the Executive Branch were 
allocated. The funds are 
required for additional 
projects such as the Student 
Directory, debts from the 
previous administration, sec- 
retarial fees, and similar 
circumstances.

Of all the Indiana and Pur- 
due regional campuses, few 
can claim the beaut.-, of the 
Fort Wayne campus. Situated 
as it is on the banks of the 
lovely tit. Joseph Eiver, sur- 
rounded by an abundance of 
grass and shady glens, the 
Fort Wayne campus is indeed 
well blessed with aesthetic 
value. 

Of further enhancement to 
the campus is the high decree 
of pride expressed by the 
students at the university 
for their campus and its 
grounds. 

The splendor cf the nat- 
ural world is not sufficient 
for these connoisseurs of 
earth's art, for they strive 
with unparalled dedication to 
increase the pieces of art 
found on the natural campus. 

Note the abundance of 
sheets of : aper found J'3 oat- 
inr around the "rounds or 
sailing serenely ;iown river 
with the current of the ^t. 
Joe. 

How wonderful it is that 
the studentn care enourh 
about the campus to spend 
time tossinr extra pieces of 
art around the grounds. 
After all, while the 'marai- 
ficence of the fall f o 1 iare 
provides color and radiance 
to the skyline, nothing can 
match the brilliance of the 
dirty, dog-eared ancient 
copies of the CoE.Lrjr.ic a tor 
gracing so man-- - bushes on 
cami us. 

liven more spectacular are 
the bright pieces of tissue 
and notebook paper which waft 
gently to earth with the 
breeze. The sight of a pink 
Scot-tiscue or Kleenex catch- 
ing the fancy of the wind is 
so full of simple beauty as 
to brinr tears to the eyes of 
the emotional. 

Paper companies of the 



world, we salute your sense 
of beauty and thank you for 
making it possible for us to 
chare in such an artistic ex- 
perience! 

The students must also be 
congratulated for bringing a 
bit of the heavens to earth. 
With a simple flip of the 
flip-top beverage can lid, 
the sparkle of the stars is 
brought to earth to nestle 
among the blades of rcrass. 

The blue of the summer sky 
is repeated in the blue of 
the stripes on Pepsi cans 
placed so strategically among 
the tree roots hugging the 
riverbank; the bouncy white 
fluff of the clouds is imitat- 
ed by the bits of styrofoam 
containers covering the patio. 

Only the styrofoom does 
the clouds one better, be- 
cause u.-.like the clouds 
which disappear at the end of 
the day, the non-destructable 
styrofoam is capable of re- 
maining intact forever. 
How fortuate we are to live 
in t v e a°!e of the ncn-dispos- 
able ! 

Students, stand up and be 
counted. You've «-one too 
long without recognition for 
your outstanding efforts in 
the furthering* of beauty on 
cam/us tc continue to be 
unheralded. 

Grab your scrap paper, 
clutch those Coke cans, fling 
your flip-tops to the hori- 
zons, and converre on the 
lawns to celebrate your cx- 
coE.plishments. . 

Winter is cominr, and the 
season for distribution of 
your items of art in the 
outside world is quickly 
drawing to a close. 

Don't hesitate, but bei in 
anew c:i your noble project of 
extending beauty to the far 
reaches of the campus! 




Large amounts of litter blarJreting the Indiana lurdue Herional 
Campus detract from its natural beauty.

Clergy Day held 



on I-PU cam 



students speak to clergymen on student act- 
t I-1U on Clergy Day. 



Abolish SAAB? 



From the President's desk 



by Hark Franke, 

Student Body I resident 
I am sure that no student 
forgets tlie 515 assessment, 
the Activity Pee, paid at 
registration. The none;- col- 
lected from the assessment of 
this fee is used to finance 
all forms of student activi- 
ties on campus. 

This includes "athletics, 
both intercollegiate and 
intramural. Also, the CCK- 
KOIIICATOH, jit Theater, 
student union Board, the Con- 
vocations Series, (remember 
"Superstar") and the Students' 
Government are financed b- f - 
the fee. 

Budgets of the above act- 
ivities must be approved by 
the Student senate, riving 
the students a direct control 
over the none;' collected for 
this benefit, i.e. for their 
recreation and entertainment. 

It is the students who de- 
termine which activities will 
receive funds to operate. 
It is students who effect the 
quality of campus life. 

Unfortunately, this pro- 
cedure in itself is too good 
to be true. At present, 
there exists a check on the 
Student Senate, a fictitious 
entity called the Student 
Activity Advisory Board. 

This Board is composed of 
four appointed students and 
four appointed faculty mem- 
bers. The SAAB has the pow- 
er of veto over all Senate 
alloc a t ions . There fore , for 
an allocation to be finalised, 
the SAAE must approve it. 

Let's look at what the 
Board has done. It would be 
unfair and untrue to accuse 
the Board of acting in poor 
faith. 

In fact, it would be un- 
fair to accuse the Board of 
acting at all. It has failed 
to meet for 1S9 days. Con- 



sequently, five Senate allo- 
cation bills lie indefinitely 
in limbo. 

A Convocations program 
featuring Lack Davis had to 
be cancelled because the 
finances for it "were still 
being considered by the 
SAAB. " 

Black History Week nearly 
suffered the same fate be- 
cause the Board had failed 
to notify the Business Office 
that it had approved the funds 
for the Week. 

These are just two of the 
most tragic examples of the 
dam.a-e that is periodically 
done by the Board; yet, 
these are typical of the 
occurrences in the Great Pa- 
per Shuffle at Indiana-Pur- 
due Universities at Fort 
Vi ayne . 

last wcunds are healing 
yet I cannot help but quest- 
ion the legitimacy of an 
aproir.tec board to have such 
authority over an elected 
representative body such as 
the student Senate'. 

The final judgement as to 
how activity money is to be 
spent should rest with those 
Senators selected for just 
that purpose. .As long as it 
follows the pre-determined 
general guidelines set by the 
Board of Trustees, the Senate 
should have to answer for its 
actions and decisions to no 
one except its constituency, 
the Student Body. 

«11 ether alternatives, 
includinr the present one, 
are either regressive or 
paternalistic situations 
that are intolerable in the 
context of the University. 

It is with this reason- 
ing that I urge Dean hanges 
to immediately and uncondit- 
ionally abolish the Student 
Activities Board.

Thirty six clergymen from 
the Ft. Wayne area visited 
Indiana-Purdue campus Tuesday 
for Clergy Day. 

Dan Lotto, campus minis- 
ter, explained the reason for 
having clergy day. "The

day was to acquaint city 
clergy with life and resources 
of the university."

for the day were speeches by 
Deans Koger I.anges, Sue 
Johnson, John Ulrer and Jim 
Gilbert. John ..aszak, Dave

represented on the panel 
were Student Government, The 
CGMflJl.ICL.2CR, Circle K, 
Black student Union, izaak 
Walton leafnie and Convoca- 
tion Committee. 

Three new appointments 

Three more appointments 
have been announced by Stu- 
dent Body President, hark 
Franke. 

Liz Szhevtchuk has been 
appointed Attorney General. 
Her duties are to research 
and assimilate information 
that will aid students in 
their dealings with such or- 
ganizations and people such 
as the Draft Board, landlords, 
etc. 

Alicia I orter and Dan ell 
Farnin have been appointed 
to the Convocations Committee. 
The two will be replacing 
Shirley Coates and* Holly 
Shook, who have resigned. 

All three appointments are 
subject to Student Senate 
confirmation.

Club Espanol has 
Halloween party 

Saturday night a group of 
Spanish students and friends 
ventured out despite spcoks, 
spectres and the Great Pump- 
kin, to meet in Centlivre 
Village for the Club Espanol 
Holloween Tarty. 

Inside the Emerald Room 
things were no less terrify- 
ing, as the hunchbacked mon- 
ster, Dick Hall, struck un- 
mitigated fear in the heart 
of a one-year old All- Ameri- 
can football-baseball-soccer 
player attending the event. 
For his getup and performance 
Dick won first prize, an LP 
album by a group called Los 
Rel'ampagos del Norte . His 
competition included such 
beauteous beasts as Chris 
Kalich as a bat and Gerry 
Vorhees as a skeleton, aa 
well as more comical apari- 
tions — Julie Rinchold and 
Cathy Hatfield as clowns. 

As it turned out almost 
no one was safe ; all ran 
the unparalledled dangers 
of being robbed by the Frito 
Bandito, losing a hand play- 
ing "spoons", getting drench- 
ed in the apple-bobbing epi- 
sode, getting asphyxiated 
from burning popcorn as 
Little Bo-Peep went looking 
for her sheep, and getting 
a dozen donuts crammed down 
their throats by a maniac 
from MASH. Nevertheless, 
the group apparently enjoyed 
them themselves. 



Folk School lists 
foreign films 

The Folk School, in coop- 
eration with Grove Fress Films 
of New York and The Classic 
Theater on The Landing, will 
present in the Fort Wayne area 
over the next five-week period 
a series of recent award- 
winning foreign films. 

The festival begins today 
and will run for five conse- 
cutive Friday and Saturday 
nights at il p.m. Due to a 
previous commitment on Hal- 
loween by the Classic Thea- 
ter, the first week's show- 
ings will be today and Sunday. 

The films in order of show- 
ing are: Boy_ by Nagisha Oshima 
A' haunting and, ultimately, ter- 
rifying film, Boy was "the 
foremost discovery" of last 
year's New York Film Festival, 
according to Newsweek which 
described it as "the study 
of an outlaw family in modern 
Japan that recalls Truffaut 
of The 400 Blows but really 
goes mush further in penetra- 
ting individual psychology 
and portraying a society." 

One week later, on Novem- 
ber 5 and 6, will be Antonio 
Das Kortes by Glauber Rocha; 
on November 12-15, L' Immort - 
elle by Alain Robbe-Grillet ; 
on November 19-20, Mandabi 
by Ousmane Sembene and on 
November 26-27, The flan who 
Lies by Alain Eobbe-Grillet. 

Each of the films and dir- 
ectors has won various prizes 
at the European and New York 
and Atlanta film festivals. 
They are of a quality rarely 
seen in the Fort Wayne area 
and it is only with the un- 
selfish cooperation of Grove 
Press Films and The Classic 
Theater that they are being 
made available to the Fort 
Wayne audience. 

General admission for the 
public will be 61.50 per per- 
son with all proceeds going 
to the Folk School. 

Flyers with a more detail- 
ed description of each film 
will be circulated at the 
beginning of each week prior 
to showing.

Three SUB positions open 
to Indiana-Purdue students 



by Jim Stoppenha-een, 

Student Union Board 

Vice Chairman 

The Student Union Board, 
an organization devoted to 
the development of the re- 
creational activities and 
programs on this campus and 
the promotion of interest in 
the student body, can only 
operate with the student ' s 
help. 

Since all full-time stu- 
dents help finance SUB acti- 
vities through the activity 
fee assessment; it would 
seem that each student would 
take an interest and partici- 
pate in these activities. 

Membership of the Student 
Union Board consists of ten 
students enrolled at this 
campus with an acedemic sche- 
dule of nine hours or more 
and at least a 2.0 accumula- 
tive index from Indiana Uni- 
versity or a 4.0 from Purdue. 
Presently there are 3 posi- 
tions unfilled. 

Deans Table starts 
in cafeteria soon 

In an effort to increase 
communication between staff 
and students, the Deans and 
Administrators of I-FU here 
will initiate a Dean's- Table . 
Wednesday, Nov. 10. The 
Table will be situated in the 
cafeteria every day from 10- 
11 a.m. 

An administrator from fine 
of the universities will be 
present at the table during 
that hour to talk to students. 

This concept of being 
available to students rather 
than requiring students to go 
to the administrators has been 
tried at several other cam- 
puses, including Lafayette. 
Hans for the Dean's Table 
may be modified in the future 
according to student response. 

Deans and Administrators 
who will participate from 
Indiana 'ire Dr. Kenneth 
Balthaser, Audiovisual Super- 
visor; David Brennan, Assist- 
and to the Chancellor; Chancel- 
lor Ralph Broyles; Mr. 
Willard Hunsberger, Librarian; 
and Dean Rue Johnson, Assist- 
ant Dean. 

Participants from Purdue 
are Mr." David Brinkerhoff , 
Assistant to the Dean; Dean 
James Gilbert, Associate Dean 
for Academic Affairs; Dean 
Kenneth Keller, Assistant 
Dean for Administration; Dean 
Joanne Lantz, Assistant Dean 
for Student Services Adminis- 
tration; Dean Roger Manges, 
Dean and Director; and Dean 
John Ulmer. 
November 5, 1971 



Wednesday Nov. 24, these 
positions should be filled. 
To qualify, a student must 
fulfill the above require- 
ments and secure a petition 
from the SUB office in G4. 
He must have the petition 
signed by thirty students be- 
fore the appointments on Nov. 
24. 

The SUB realizes that only 
a few students can actually 
be SUB members, however this 
does not mean that everyone 
cannot participate. 

The SUB will solicit stu- 
dents' suggestions Nov. 8-12 
at a table outside the cafe- 
teria concerning the type of 
dance they would like to have 
honoring the deans. 

Suggestions are also ask- 
ed for preverences for nat- 
ional groups to entertain in 
concert for Midwinter Carni- 
val and Harbararbar days, 
both occuring in the spring 
semester. Any opinions con-^ 
cerning these functions and r 
any other activities will 
be greatly appreciated. 

Student Union Board further 
pursuades all students to 
participate in the forthcom- 
ing Penny Carnival Saturday, 
Nov. 13. 

Participation can include 
either the organizing a booth 
by any campus organization, 
by assisting by assisting 
the SUB in the coordination 
of the carnival, or by merely 
adopting a child for the 
evening. 

Any information concerning 
the carnival can be obtained 
from the SUB table outside the 
cafeteria or from any Union 
Board Member. 

All groups entering a 
booth should contact Student 
Services in Room 105 for lo- 
cation of booths. 

It should be emphasized 
that the Student Union Board 
is an organization which must 
fulfill the wishes of the 
students. It is impossible 
to do so without the cooper- 
ation of the students. 

Dickens Dinner planned 
for December dates 

The Fourth Annual Dickens 
Dinner will be held December 
3, 4, 10, and 11 at the Fort 
Wayne Womans Club.

son of Music is allowing fac- 
ulty, students, and staff to 
have first choice for ticket 
reservations. Reservations 
are being taken now. Gener- 
al Public ticket sales will

Black Food Holiday 
held on campus 

by Philip Love 

Black students of the I-HJ 
Regional Campus were net going 
to eat their food; hence, 
Black Food Holiday was organ- 
ized, 

BFH was founded by Clara 
Wright, one of the best soul 
food chicks on campus. Clara 
was planning to give a speech 
on soul food in Cocir,uni ca- 
tions 114. 

Soul food originated during 
slavery times. It was the 
food thnt the white man dis- 
carded from his table or con- 
sidered unappetizing. 

In an effort to decide 
what dish to prepare for 
speech class, Clara consulted 
her brothers and sisters. 

After listening to several 
suFT"-estions Clara decided tU 
that a sweet potato pie would 
be the blackest dish to pre- 
pare. However, in the course 
of the conversation Cloleal 
'..'alters, a sister, supirested 
that the group have a whole 
dinner, 

Everybody wanted to bring 
all sorts of soul concoc- 
tions but eventually the menu 
consisted of preens, corn- 
bread, fried chicken, potato 
salad, green beans, sweet 
potato pie, and to spice 
things up, onions, hot sause, 
and hot peppers. 

The first BFH was a suc- 
cess and everyone enjoyed 
their change of aenu::. In 
fact, we decided to have a 
3K-: every m-inth. 

There was one problem, 
however. Clara was to bring 
the pies since she was going 
to prepare one for her speech 
class, '..'hen she jrave her pre- 
sentation (which earned her 
a good rrade) the students 
in her class wanted a piece 
of pie. 

After each of her class- 
mates rot a piece there 
wasn't enoueh for BFH but I 
hope they enjoyed their pie 
because I surely enjoyed my 
little piece.

Violette receives Ph. D 

The latest recipient of 

the Ph.D. degree at the Fort 
Wayne Regional Campus is 
Aurela J. Violette, of the 
Indiana University History 
Department. Dr. Violette 
did his research in Finland 
and Russia and wrote his dis- 
sertation on the Russian Ilavy. 

a native of Maine, he re- 
cieved his B.S. from Bowdoin 
College and both the I..A. and 
the Ih.D. from Ohio State 
University. 

Dr. Violette taught his 
first Russian History classes, 
H201 and H202, at the local 
campus last year. The stu- 
dents in H202 so appreciated 
his teaching and the high 
degree of interest he engen- 
dered that at the end of the 
semester they presented him 
with a memento of his first 
year of teaching. The gift 
was the book Civilization by 
Kenneth Clark. 

Dr. Violette especially 
appreciated this book be- 
cause he admires Clark and 
because he collects well- 
illustrated books.

I-PU Junior is 
sports official 

Al Christoules, I-IU Jun- 
ior, is an Industrial Manage- 
ment major and a certified 
basketball, baseball and foot- 
ball official. 

al, who is an ■avid sports 
fan, has been officiating 
high school afcheletic events 
for the past 6 years. He 
also scans the action in vari- 
ous I-1U intramural sports 
programs and is presently 
calling the infractions in 
flag football. 

A desire to "stay in shape" 
and a personal hope of im- 
proving high school officia- 
ting spurred Al into writing 
to the IHSAA for copies of 
their rule books. Later, 
after digesting what he had 
read, Al passed the IilbAA 
exams and became a registered 
official. 

He then was permitted to 
officiate Jr. HiFrh and Jr. 
Varsity sporting events. 
Two years later, after re- 
cievinr eif*ht performance 
ratings from various Hi^h 
School Ath]etic Directors, Al 
was certified by the Ulc^A. 

Kow he travels throurhout 
the state callinr the action 
in varsity contests. For ( 
example, tonight he heads* 
for West Lafayette where he 
is officiating a high school 
basketball game. 

^1 feels we hjive the talent, 
^peed and size ; eciiccary for 
an I-PU club fooU'-tll squad. 

However, he is dir.gusted 
with the apathy and lack of 
surport the student body (-.as 
displayed in regard to the 
I-it Coccer and Basketball 
teams. 

Al ' s toup-hest assignment 
ar a referee came about in a 
basketball contest between 
ELihurst and Belmont. 

The second official fail- 
ed to show and Al had to solo 
for the nirht. 




Two intrcnural tc:*ms battle it out on the football 
field. 

Intramural football games reviewed 



Last week 'scontest between 
the Posse and Ashbacher was 
a game to remember. 

The two squads fought a 
scoreless battle for 49 of 
the 50 minutes of play. 

Then with 45 seconds to 
go, the losse's quaterback 
Beaver passed to Bog^s for 
a TD. The clock expired be- 
fore Aschbachers team could 
recipricate. 

KcMahon took the Beavers 
21 to 8 and Cook collected a 
forfeit from Johnron. 

Woolems slipped by Krause 
6-0 after Jim Chaney grabbed 
a pass from his quaterback and 
scrambled into the end zone. 
Krause had an apparent score 
called back for a clipping 
infraction and the rame then 
became a physical defensive 
battle. 

The liads, previously unde- 
feated, fell to the speedy 
Hohen-Roy squad. The g^ls 
le-.id once in the contest 21- 
19 but H-fl decided to turn 
the tables.

I-PU basketball team prepares for opener 



by Phil Hartmann 

The basketball Mastodons 
are working out daily in 
preparation for their home 
opener Inov. 20. against Grace. 

Athletic director Jim 
Bolinger is extremely optim- 
istic toward this sauad 
which will attempt to improve 
last year's 13-15 log. 

He says that last year, 
although possessing good 
shooters, the team lacked the 
rebounding power needed to 
be a big winner. This year 
Bolinger expects the rebound- 
ing to be vastly improved. 

The new coach is" George 
Wehrmeister, His assistant 
is Gene Hany. 

According to Bolinger, 
they have an extremely im- 



pressive looking crop of guys 
to choose from. 1-iore than 
thirty hopefuls are presently 
working out. 

One problem facting this 
year's squad, however appears 
to be the lack of a full-time, 
competent student manager. 
Anyone with an interest in 
this job is urged to apply 
immediately. 

Another problem is the 
lack of fan support. In the 
first two years of varsity 
basketball about the only 
active support was from lo- 
cal fraternities and sorori- 
ties. This year, with the 
saying that everyone supports 
a winner firmly in mind, 
hopefully a good following 
will be present. 



gams. 

farrell topped the Grea- 
sers 18-0 in an impressive 
win. One of Farrell ' s 
chargers was blasted during 
the action and was removed 
from the gume by another 
team menfber. 

Farrell, who was not to 
be denied, finished the win- 
ning effort with only 6 
players. 

Reed-ierry won a squeaker 
over Ambrose G-6. Ambrose's 
Tom Fabian grabbed a possible 
scoring pasr from 'is quater- 
back as time ran out but fell 
a yard short of the end-zone. 
The Train maintained their 
second division lead by de- 
featinr Walters-Lvnrts 12-G. 

Last week in a sumrnary 
sheet compiled by the Train's 
captain this writer was ad- 
vised that Dietz planned their 
winning effort over Woolems. 
A few of the boxcars have re- 
quested a retraction of that 
statement. 

Dietz is Jaworsky's girl- 
friend. The credit for the 
win should have '-one to the 
Train's quarterback. 

Some guys would walk a 
mile to impress a chick.
