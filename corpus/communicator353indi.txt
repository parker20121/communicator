The 1P|-"W a 
departments have been working for 
two years to create a graduaic degree 
for I clinical nurse spe«ialisl with a 
focus on psychiatric mental health. 
This program was designed using the 
Indiana Campus Network financial 
model. It will be offered in the spring 

Forty- nine pciceni of the core 
courses are offered at IPFW and 51 
perceni of them are al [UPUl. All 
courses will be taught on the inlcrnel 
as well. Clinical work can be com- 
pleted at local facilities. All crcdiu 
from Indianapolis will transfer to Foit

working with Southern Indiana on a

works with problems such as schizo-

variety of other sellings. 

"I don'l know of another univer-

In addition to helping Ihe com-

classes from being cancelled. 
Somclimcs Ihcre arc only Ihree or

This improvisation will allow slu-

"If you live in Hoban, then you 

conduct cljnical work al the local

Currently there are two students 
who have wailed in anticipation for 
this program to be enacted. They are 
happy It has gone through, said 
Slernberger. There is some immediate

Labor of love 



Four years ago my husband and I spent 
Labor Day in Florida, visiting family we 
hadn't seen since our wedding a yeor and a 
half earlier. I was three months pregnant 
with our first child. While we were down 
diere. my sister-in-law threw a baby show- 
er for us. as she knew we wouldn't be back 
for at least a year. On the cake she had 
made, it read, "Have an easy 'Labor 
Day'." 1 remember thinking that, of 
course, my teal "labor day" would not be 

ing cake and opening presents, visiting 
uiih family and fiiends thai we missed. 
No, nothing could be quite so easy as 
siuffing my face and being waited on. 

Holly's much-anticipalcd arrival 
came early the neil Match, i full month after my due dale. The doc- 
tors had to induce labor and when jhc finally was bom the nurses 
remarked on how heavy she was. She weighed ten pounds, eiactly, 
and was Iwcnty-onc inches long. "Not your typical newborn," they 
remarked. "No one eipccis a firstborn lo be that big." I had to rcbui, 
rather saicosucally, that 1 didn't etpcci to go a month past my due 
dale or to be left in delivery for 36 hours. 

We took Holly home and setilcd peacefully into our new roles, 
both individually and ai a fiunily. My husband's dad surprised. us 
with round-trip tickets lo south Florida jbr all three of us. just two

(Although not in the specific manner to which she made that refer- 
ence. .) Love changed all of that and four years later I found myself 
at the altar, wondering whal in the world had been wrong with me for 
so long. Of course it made sense to stand there, pledging lifelong loy- 
alty lo the one who loved me into responsibility and helped me appre- 
ciate one's heritage and upbringing. 

If I would have known he was going lo do all of thai at the time 
that we met. t would have avoided him like the plague. Now that 
we're parents, it's amazing lo me how very different 1 am from the 
person I've described from 10 years ago. And yet, somehow, it :

thought of doing things the way they've always 
been done, simply because that's how they've always been done. 

I am. however, diametrically opposite in leniis of attitude. 
Whereas I used to make fun of authorities and leaders, t now harbor 
a very deep respect for my elders, my protectors and those who havi 
struggled to educate themselves and others. I treasure the past am

the unexpected. 

Holly was everything we'd hoped for and prayed over every 
nighL We were very blesied with her arrival, and surprised every day 
al the new things she could do. Have you ever witnessed someone's 
Tiisi smile? Whal about the eipression on the face of an infant, the 
first time she has a taste of strained peas? Have you eiperienced the 
joy of making a child laugh or fell the weight of shame for coming 
down loo hard and causing her to cry? It's an incredible thing, raising 
a child. I've likened it to having a new present to open each day 
because you watch them unfold one layer at a lime, like the petals on 
a rose when it's coming into bloom. Witnessing childhood wonder 
and innocence, to really feel it. is a transrotming eipcrience in 

and of itself When an adult recognizes that a child is discovering 
something for the first time, there's an innate rekindling of curiosity 



You could say that I am a "non-uadilional" sludenl, 1 graduated 
from high school in 1989 and went on lo college for two years, but 
really didn't care about studying. I was along for the tide and wanted 
to play It didn't phase me to drop out of school and I could have cared 
less about getting married, having children, establishing a career or 
any of the "normal" paths we are socialiled lo believe we should fol- 
low. I fit the mold for more than one stereotype, some of which are 
quite obvious and others that I won't name. I never really was a bad 
person, just someone who loathed protocol, bureaucracy and tradi- 
■■— ' forewarned my husband on our first date, that I was not look- 



This past Labor Day. just three days ago, my family and 1 tfav- 
eled to visit my parents in the northeoslem region of Indiana. I need- 
ed to study. 1 had phone calls to make, daytimcrslo organize and syl- 
labi to pemse. There were a thousand things jostling around in my 
mind when Holly come up and said, "Mommy-" I slopped her 
sentence, telling her I needed to work and could not carry out pi 
she kept interrupting. Again, she said, "Mommy. [-" and again I 
rupled. "Go tell your daddy, whatever it is, and have him gel w 
is that you need. Mommy's busy." Undaunted still, she blurted i 
fast as she could, "Mommy I love you," Stealing a kiss and i 
before 1 could object, she whisked away toward more friendly w 

What kind of person could wave away a sweel child, whose only 
objective was to imparl a blessing? 1 cursed myself for being so self- 
ish and add rose up lo chase her before losing the moment. And then 
1 thought back to what I had heard, all the years I'd grown up in rebel- 

You've got to plan and follow it through. Without a plan, you'll 
never achieve your goals because you don't know where it is thai 
you're headed." As it turns out. that maxim is only panially vue. My 
years as a mommy, more than anything else, have crystallized per- 
fectly the completion of that phrase. It is indeed necessary to have 
some kind of path, but not so essential that it cannot be altered. My 
path is much better for the people who have inteirupted il. Contrary 
to what I previously thought, the easiest thing possible is to love oth- 
ers. Sometimes surprises are exactly what we need.

At more traditional universities with on-

pointed out to me. She noticed thai students at 
IPFW have "lives" outside the university We 
oflcn use that as an excuse not to attend class, 
myself included. 

Somelimcs I wouldn't attend a class

Another aspect you have to consider is 
how your absenteeism affects fellow students. 
I just changed my major lo communication 
and. unsurprisingly, there is a group project in 
all four of my classes. Based on past experi- 
ences. I'm nol thai excited aboul these proj- 
ects mainly because people tend to disappear. 

They arc impossible to find. If work has 
to be done in doss and one person is nol there 
a huge mess is created. Students owe it lo 
their group to gel the job done. 

There are also those students who show 
up to class once a month. After the class is 
over they seem like bums who are not beg- 
ging for food, but for class notes. When you 
don't like a course and ii's required, you 
should grin and bear il or drop oul. 



Students who do not want to physically 
get themselves ready and sit in traditional 
classrooms should take correspondence or
