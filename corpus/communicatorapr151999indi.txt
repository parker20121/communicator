campus to have fun and get 
together," said Lisa Coomer, 
Delta Gamma vice president 
of foundations. 

Members of Delta 
Gamma have made arrange- 
ments for the players of the 
men's 1PFW basketball team 
to serve as referees during tru 
Slam." 

This is the first time Delta Gamma is 
holding the "Anchor Slam." However, Delta 
Gamma members plan on making it an 
annual campus event. 

Besides the basketball tournament, 
"Anchor Slam" will also include other events 
such as relays and a lip sync contest to sup- 



The game will provide a 
fun atmosphere where 
you can give back to the 
less fortunate."

"Anchor 



pi) fun forall those who attend. 

The basketball game will serve as a 
fundraiser for an organization that supports 
the blind. 

"The game will provide a fun atmos- 
phere where you can give back to the less 
fortunate in the community," said Sara 
Whitaker, a member of Delta Gamma. 

Delta Gamma's philanthropy strives to 
help others in the community. 

"1 am looking forward 
to everyone getting 
involved in the event," said 
Mindy Laubhan, a Delta 
Gamma member. 

The Delta Gamma 
members hope this event 
will inform other IPFW stu- 
dents that there are Greek 
chapters on campus. 

After the "Anchor 
Slam" is complete, there 
will be trophies and door 
prizes supplied by sponsors 
such as Foot Locker, Finish line, Mike's 
Carwash and Mark Fore awarded to the win- 
ning teams. 

"Overall, the event will be a day of fun," 
said Lacey Gall, also a member of Delta 
Gamma.

Work Study offers 
summer employment 




Junior Benji Gibbs speaks with junior Mandy Loveless and freshman Jenny Miller at the inlormalion desk in 
Gales Sports Center. 



by Carrie Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 



Both federal and institutional work study 
programs are available this summer lor 
students. 

Students interested in federal work stud) 
programs need to fill out Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), if they have not 
done so already, and turn it in as soon as 
possible. 

If a student has already filled out the 
FAFSA, they need to fill out an additional appli- 
cation in Financial Aid. 

"Students need to fill out the form saying 
that they want to be reviewed for financial aid 
for the summer session and they can indicate on 
there that they want to be considered for federal 
work study," said Robert Zellers, director of 
Financial Aid Services. 

If the federal government decides that a 
student is eligible for a work stud) program, 
based on need, the student must also enroll at 
IPFW for at least three credit hours both sum- 



mer sessions. 

"For summer, work study eligibility is 
awarded both on student need and if the stu- 
dent is enrolled for one class each summer ses- 
sion," Zellers said. 

Once a student has determined eligibility, 
he or she must still find a work-study position 
on campus. 

Currently, the department of Arts and 
Sciences and also Disabled Student Services have 
possible openings for summer work study. 

Arts and Sciences may be contacted at 481- 
6160 and Disabled Students Services at 481- 
6657. 

Other positions are also available in the reg- 
istrar's office, at the Milliard Gates Sports Center 
and through Julie Newcomer and the Indiana 
Reading Corps. 

Newcomer mi)' be contacted at 481-6443. 

Students interested in openings at the 
Millard Gates Sports Center may call either 
48 1-5 480 for a position in game manage- 
ments or 481-6647 for fitness center 
assistant.

Tribute to a Teacher 



by Steven Murphy 



Please allow me to share a thought with you concerning a 
particular professor here on campus. For certain determining 
factors of procedure and protocol which prevent and prohibit 
me from doing so, 1 cannot tell you her name outright. 
However, lean say that she is in the English department and 
teaches writing courses. The primary motive 1 have for wanting 
to tell you about her is simple: She is awesome. I know thai 
awesome is not a scholarly word, but it is a very befitting adjec 
live in this case. In support of this affirmation, I have several 
varied, yet equally valid reasons for holding her up to such 
lofty regard. Nonetheless, in order to emphasize my point of 
appreciation, I will limit my justifications to three examples. 

To begin with, she really knows her subject area. This is 
expected of most professors so I am not breaking am new 
ground here, but it is her adeptness and ability- to transfer this 
knowledge to her students which sets her apart from many of 
her colleagues. She is well-versed in writing, both fundamental- 
ly and procedurally, and she exudes a confidence and capabili- 
ty which at times is unrivaled. Her deliver;' is both smooth and 
elegant. All of this translates into enthusiasm and accomplish- 
ment for her students; she sets them up to succeed and expects 
that they will. The significance of her teaching skills though, is 
that she doesn't claim to know everything. Her willingness to 
be vulnerable through humbleness and humilitv is refreshing 
to a struggling student. This ability to see things' from a broad- 
er perspective leads me to my next point, her dexterity to think 
on a higher plane. 

This professor views life as a wide open space with no room 
for accepting ignorance as a viable excuse. This has caused me 
to expand my horizon and become more well-rounded in m\ 
own thinking, not only as a student, but also as a person. She 
comes up with the most seemingly obscure, sometimes enig- 
matic, and occasionally ambiguous facts and ideology, con- 
trivances which often leave me baffled and puzzled. These trin- 
kets and tidbits of information stay with me until 1 find mvself 
following up our conversation with research on the topic, at 
least until I can gain equal footing with her on the subject. 
Usually though, by the time this has occurred she has moved 
on to something else. The only salvation I have for mv efforts is 
that perhaps one day we will be the King and Queen of Trivial 
Pursuit, or better yet, 1 can be her prep partner for the 
inevitable Jeopard)' appearance. 

The third determining factor for my everlasting gratitude 
to this professor has to do with her loyalty and dedication to 
me specifically. She has gone far past her required responsibili- 
ties as an instructor and taken on the role of mentor. She is 
bound and determined to ensure that I will be qualified and 
prepared when I leave this campus. Even though I have not 
always lived up to her expectations - her standards are 
extremely high - despite the fact that I am quite capable, she 
has not lost faith in me. Whether it be a less than spectacular 
effort on her final examination or a faltering at a research con- 
ference, she has stood by and refused to abandon me. For this, 
I am eternally grateful. (Fortunatelv for me, I have an opportu- 
nity for redemption on the latter; the IPFW Undergraduate 
Research Conference and Svmposium on Fridav, April 23, in 
Walb. Be there!) 

In bringing this testimonial to a close. I will leave you with 
a final thought. I would encourage anyone to find out who this 
professor is and to take her course, especially freshmen and 
sophomores. Although the class itself may prove to be decided- 
ly challenging, I can assure you the result will be well worth the 
effort. The preparation required lo prosper under her tutelage 
will propel and prepare you for any advanced course in what- 
ever discipline you are pursuing. In addition, vou may find a 
new friend in the deal. This is what is implied when I say she is 
awesome. That is all. 



Staff Editorial 



TOPIC: 

City drug house ordinance 

WHAT WE THINK: 

It's good, but is it really practical? 

Recently, officers from Allen Count) met with represen- 
tative.' from the Apartment Association of Port Wayne- 
Northeast Indiana to speak about the enforcement of a 
drug-house ordinance in the county. 

We would like to commend 'the Allen Count) Police 
Department for trying to expand this ordinance to Allen 
count). 

Under the city ordinance, created in 1993, it is manda- 
tor)- for landlords to evict tenants involved with drugs, 
prostitution and gambling. 

If the landlords do not comply with the law thev race 
heavy lines. 

The Fort Wayne ordinance does not allow the use of 
real estate for these activities. 

The ordinance was created to lower these violations in 
Fort Wayne. It worked. 

Five hundred houses have been "cleaned out" by 
of this ordinance. 

Where do the violators go when they are "kicked out"? 
Currently, no such ordinance exists in the county. 

Obviously, the place to be is outside of Fort Wayne, yet 
close enough lo keep the "customers." 

Therefore, anyone who wished to participate in the 
activities could do so within the vicinity of Fort Wayne. 

We believe that to evict drug dealers, gamblers and 
prostitutes only in the city is defeating the purpose. 

Wilhout this ordinance covering all of Allen county the 
problem is simply moved a little farther away. 

The violators are pushed onto someone else to deal 
with, creating a new "neighbor from hell," a new pain for 



other landlords and the count) police. 

The act of moving the ordinance a little farther away 
brings up another issue. 

Although we feel this is a positive move by the police 
department, we question the idea of simply relocating ordi- 
nance violators. 

Mow far away can you move the offenders? 

Under this new ordinance the) have to go to another 
cit) such as Decatur, Auburn. Huntington or Columbia City. 

The same problems will arise once again in those com- 
munities. 

Perhaps those in charge of the situation should tr) 
another method of punishment. 




Letters to the Editor 



Vegetarians also consume to survive 



To the Editor, 

I am writing this letter in response to the view- 
point put forward by Robert Greener concerning the 
"veggies only" lifestyle. While 1 can't disagree with 
the potential health benefits of going green, 1 do have 
a problem with the second argument Mr. Greener 
used concerning the murdering of animals. I have , 
often wondered at the lengths people will go to make 
themselves feel morally above another group. 

As a copious consumer of animal products, I 
know that I am taking part in the gruesome slaughter 
and dismemberment of all manner of animals. The 
hard core vegetarians of this world are more than 
happy to point that out to me. But as Homo Sapiens I 
am just doing what I need to do to survive: consume. 
"Not 1," says the vegetarian. "1 don't hurt animals 
when 1 sit down lo my soy burger and yogurt' 
smoothie." The soy that vou are enjoying (though I 
doubt very much) came from a vast field of sov that 
many a creature would love to call home. While'l take 
part in the barbaric slaughter and feasting of Elsie 
the cow and Chuckles the chicken, there is a coyote 
somewhere looking through a barbed wire fence over 
a bean farmer's field that used to be a part of his 
range thinking "damn vegetarians." I admit thai 1 am 
an environmental home wrecker. Why can't all of the 
hard core veggie heads do the same? Is it more wrong 
in some way to slaughter and process an animal bred 
and raised for that exclusive purpose than it is to 
contribute to habitat destruction and water system 
poisoning? We are all part of the problem. 

Mr. Greener alluded to his belief that "almost all 
animals have very humanlike emotions, which any 
pet owner knows." While I found Babe's performance 
a bit dry in "Babe, Pig in the City" 1 bet his chops are 
moist and flavorful. I lived on a farm for some num- 



ber of years as a child and never once said to mvself 
"now those are some happy cows" or "1 wonder 
what's bothering the chickens today, they seemed 
kind of bummed." Maybe we should let all of the 
poor delicious animals out of their cages and pens so 
they can live full fruitful lives or get hit by a car. 

"Could you kill. and eat your pet?" Sir. Greener 
asks. I know my cat would eat me if given half the 
chance. Right now we're al'a stando'ff.' ' " j 

As.it turns out, Mr. Greener, vou, v'bur veg-head 
friends, and -every other human is doing their part 
each and every da)* to kill animals for food or so we 
can grow something. At least the flesh mongers are 
doing it in a straightforward and honest way. The 
vegetarians of the world are doing it sneaky and one 
so&gt;' field at a time. 

I admire those who have the will power and 
bland palates to give up meat for health reasons, 
the)' will outlive me by many a tasteless year. When 
some vegi-nazi uses the word 'compassion,' however, 
1 get a little offended. Don't dilute yourself with some 
grandiose feeling of morality by comparing my steak 
to your dog. Being human, vou are a killer one way 
or another; you can not escape that fact. It is your 
choice as a human, though, on whether or not you 
are a hypocrite. 

In response to our final question, Mr. Greener: 
"Now how can you make fun of vegetarians?" I reply: 
Usually I just point and laugh, but sometimes I throw 
hot dogs. 

No animals were harmed in the making of this 
editorial, but I did taunt some squirrels just prior to 
typing it. Now back to my big fat burger.

Student pledges social responsibility 



To My Fellow Graduates; 

Flere we are, emerging from a fine institution of 
higher education, after years of learning the most 
current social, cultural and technical information of 
the age, within the most free and democratic country 
on Earth. We have before us the widest range of 
opportunities and choices ever available to anyone in 
the history of humanity. Each of us has daily at our 
fingertips more information than the entire Pentagon 
had at the close of World War 11. Because of all this, 
our generation of graduates is better equipped to 
lead our country, and the world, to the most intelli- 
gent courses of action, using the most effective 
means, in order to overcome humanity's ills which 
previous generations were powerless lo effect. 

Our unique opportunity as citizens of the United 
States of America lies in our personal choice in the 
balance between freedom and responsibility. As 
young people and as students it has seemed that 
these are polar opposites. The more of one 1 possess 
the less of ihe other. More freedom means less 
responsibility. More responsibility means less free- 
dom. But as we mature, as we go into the world as the 
new wave of educated citizens, and begin choosing 
which responsibilities with which we are willing to 
saddle ourselves, we will find that this is not the 
whole picture. 

In a democracy, 'people are said to be free, but 
what thev are free to do is to take responsibility for 
governing themselves, or to leave it up to someone 
else. It is ironic thai when vou are totally- free of all 
responsibility, you are totally under the control of 
the people who are taking ihe responsibility! Is thai 
freedom? In a democracy, responsibility equals 



power. Whatever you are responsible for is under 
your control, or authority. 

Many universities around the country are offer- 
ing their graduating students the opportunity to 
make a "Pledge of Social and Environmental 
Responsibility." 

The pledge reads: 

"1 pledge to explore and take into account the 
social and environmental consequences of an) 1 job I 
consider or any organization for which 1 work." 

It leaves people free to determine for themselves 
what they consider to be socially and environmental- 
ly responsible. It challenges each of us to pay atten- 
tion to our own corner of society, and to be inten- 
tional about being a responsible citizen for a sustain- 
able world. 

At our own university, it is up to the students 
themselves to provide leadership in making the 
pledge available to the graduating class. As a gradu- 
ate and bearer of a Certificate in Peace and Conflict 
Studies, I am taking that responsibility on myself. I 
will be offering ihe pledge at the post-commence- 
ment celebration on May 12 at the Memorial 
Coliseum. I will have a table next to ihe diploma table 
during the party. There will be pledge cards and 
green ribbons available. 

Whether you are joining the commencement cer- 
emonies or not, whether you are graduating or not, 
whether you sign a card and wear a ribbon or not, I 
encourage each of you to honestly make this pledge 
to yourself in your own inmost heart.

All About the Movies 

Screen's greatest draw 
slowing down with age 



by Ben Freese, 
Staff Writer 



There is not a doubt in 
the mind of any serious movie 
fan that Harrison Ford is the 
greatest box office draw of all 
time. 

lie has made us laugh, 
cry, feel sorrow, cheer him on, 
and hope for his safe escape, 
all in the name of giving us a 
taste of movie excitement. 

ford has been the corner- 
stone of the movie industry 
for the last two decades and is 
unequivocally the most well- 
known superstar to ever come 
out of Hollywood. 

Specifically, he had quite 
a hand in bringing America 
the "event film" such as "Star 
Wars," "Indiana Jones," and 
"Blade Runner" which inspired 
movies for so long that ihey 
are still being copied today 
(which, of course, has its good 
and bad points). 

No one human being has 
had as man&gt; box office hits or 
been responsible for providing 
so much influence in 
Hollywood. 

No human being has been 
able to capture and captivate 
audiences (both young and 
old) to the extent old Harry 
has done. 

No human being could 
ever hope to be like Harrison 
ford. The only problem is that 
Harrison Ford is no longer the 
Harrison Ford of old. 

He's an old actor trying to 
hang on as his box office is 
slowly sucked away by young 
undeserving stars and old 
recycled actors getting yet 
another chance to prove them- 
selves. 

People like Will Smith 
(not to be confused with the 
greatest characterr actor of all 
time, Willia^n Smith, for all 
those older folks who remem- 
ber him), Leonardo DiCaprio, 
Matt "mv teeth are perfect" 
Damon. Ben Affleck, and 
James Vanderbeek are those 
pretty boy types that get on 
vour nerves and smile way too 
much. 

Harrison Ford was on all 
of the big magazine covers, 
not simply the teeny-bopper 
magazines, get it??!! 

People like John Travolta 
(and, boy, has his career died 
again in this last year or 
what?), Nicolas Cage, and Sean 
Conner\ keep trying to find 
ways of making comebacks 
from their previous come- 
backs! 

Only Ford has maintained 
his superstar status as "the 
man" for what has been my 
entire period of life on this 
earth. 

Recently, this hero I grew 
up watching as a boy has had 
a few hits and misses. 

Sure, Harry had a dark 
spot here and there in the past 
(albeit "Regarding Henry" is 
about the only one), but lately 
it seems like more and more 
often. * 

As far as box office in the 
last several years, he's had 
some major Hops ("Six Days, 
Seven Nights" and "The Devil's 



Own"), an "old softy"- 
type mediocre hit 
("Sabrina") and his 
blockbusters have 
been old re-releases 
("Stars Wars" trilogy), 
and formulaic, special 
effects-laden drivel 
("Air Force One"). 

Now, don't get 
me wrong, I enjoyed 
all of the aforemen 
tioned films, it's just that I 
found myself enjoying 
Harrison Ford a lot more then 
the movies themselves. 

If there's nothing else to 
his films nowadays, then no 
wonder nobody's coming to 
see them (of course, what can 
you do if you're handed David 
Schwimmer, Anne Heche, and 
Brad "help me, my career is 
dying" Pitt?). 

I feel bad for Harrison 
Ford, even though there's no 
reason to be sad. 

He's had a great run and, 
who knows, he may have 
another big hit left in him. 

It's simply that I miss the 
good old days, where every- 
body looked forward to his 
movies. 

Harry's films would come 
out, crowds would be melded 
to their seats in suspense, and 
the box office would show the 
results. 

Harrison Ford was the 
biggest box office draw of all 
time and he'll have to. step 
down soon. 

It's a sad fact of life and I 
don't want to face the truth. 

Instead, I think I'd rather 
look back and enjoy the great 
work he has done. 

The following is a list of 
my five favorite Harrison Ford 
films and, while most were 
huge box office hits, that is not 
the basis for my choosing 
them. ,..,■' - : 

1 chose these films 
because, in some way, they 
have given me enjoyment and 
happiness throughout my life- 
time. 

1. Blade Runner. 

This film is actually m&gt; 
favorite movie of all time. 

It may not be for every- 
body, but I also feel that it is 
the best motion picture in the 
long, incredible history of the 
movies. 

No story could ever hope 
to capture the importance of 
life and its meaning that we as 
human beings search for dur- 
ing the entire course of our 
existence. 

Also, no film will ever be 
able to display the sadness of 
the fact that death is 
inevitable and we've only got 
limited time to make the most 
out of it. 

2. The Fugitive. 

If ever there was a "com- 
mon man" hero, it has to be 
Ford as the doctor falsely 
accused of murdering his wife. 
Ford is perfectly under- 
stated and always the under- 
dog while being hunted b&gt; 
Oscar-winner Tommy Lee 
Jones as a U.S. Marshall, in this 
slick piece of action-packed 
intensity.

3. Indiana Jones 
Trilogy. 

Face it, Indy was a phe- 
nomenon in this country and 
these films solidified Ford as a 
leading man. 

No person could hope to 
ever be as cool and adventure- 
some as the Archeologist- 
Professor that Ford portrayed. 
Of course, nobody could ever 
forget Sean Conner)- as Ind) 's 
bumbling dad. 

4. Witness. 

Out of all of lord's films, 
this ma)' have been his best 
performance. 

He should have won the 
Oscar for it, but his nomina- 
tion was the Academy's way of 
saying, "Good job, but you'll 
never win because you're too 
big of a star!" 

5. Star Wars 
Trilogy. 

He may not have been the 
star of these films, but he cer- 
tainly stole the audiences' 
attention. His Han Solo char- 
acter's cocky attitude pro- 
pelled himself to super star- 
dom. 

After all, what Star Wars' 
fan wasn't devastated when 
Han .was taken away by the 
empire during the bleak end- 
ing of the best SW film, "The 
Empire Strikes Back"? ■ h . .

Poetry book added to list of 
accomplishments of ex-prof 



by Mishanna Wood, 
News Editor 



Former IPFW English professor 
James Dudley Woolf recently pub- 
lished "Earlj' and Late Poems," a col- 
lection of his poetry spanning six 
decades of his experience and life, 

After his retirement, Woolf 
decided to share one of his lifetime 
hobbies with the public - writing 
poetry. 

"I have a desire to write. If a per- 
son has something to express he 
doesn't like to suppress it. You can 
write a poem to gel it out of jour s&gt; s- 
tern," said Woolf. 

During his years in the Navy and 
undergraduate school Woolf wrote 
what he calls "Early poems." These 
were written from 1939 to 1950. 

Woolf took 20 years off from 
writing poetry to devote his time to 
his rami!)' and earning his Ph.D. 

The "late" poems were written 
from 1970 to 1994. 

According to Woolf, the poems 
show his views of himself as a young 
man and an older man. It shows 
growth and maturity, said Woolf. 

Wool! said that his "early" 
poems are his favorite and that the) 
are reflections of his thoughts as a 
young man. 

Woolf said he finds his motiva- 
tions to write from ideas or actions 
he wishes to develop. 

For example, in the poem "Love 
in the Autumn" Woolf got his idea 
from something he heard on the 
radio. 

"A reporter on the radio spoke 
about a man in his mid-life who 
watched television most of the time 
and neglected his wife. In the poem 
the wife wants to know which is more 
important, the relationship or televi- 
sion. This creates conflict in the 
poem," Woolf said. 

"Girl of the Ozarks" was about a 
girl he was fascinated with. 

"It was about an unrequited 
love, a love that was not fulfilled. She 
was a friend and we dined in the 
cafeteria," said Woolf. 

"Pacific Sunsets" was written 
while Woolf was in the Navy. He was 




James Woolf 

stationed in a motor torpedo boat 
near the island of Mios Wendi in 
northeast New Guinea. 

WoolTs favorites from his ■'late" 
poems his four part monologue and 
"Dreams of Fulfillment: a record of 
natural therapy." 

The monologue expresses the 
thoughts of Hamlet, Cordelia the 
daughter of King Lear, Heraclitus and 
Christ. 

"All of these poems are about 
religion. They reflect my studies of 
English Literature and religious cul- 
ture," Woolf said. 

"The second poem is about 
thoughts on love and loyalty in a 
relationship through my dreams. It 
helped me recover from my wife's 
death," Woolf said. 

Woolf's wire, Carolyn Meiers 
passed away in 1984. Woolf married 
Meiers in 1953 and had three chil- 
dren. 

Woolf has dedicated his book of 
poetry, "Early and Late Poems," to 
his wife, his friend Joan' and Don 



Gray, professor of English at Indiana 
University in Bloominglon. 

Woolfs book is on sale at Little 
Professor Bookstore and Follets for 
S12. 

On April 24 at 2 p.m.. Woolf will 
be signing books at Little Professor. 
He will be signing books at Follets on 
April 20 at 9 a.m. 

"He is the epitome of the desig- 
nation a gentleman and a scholar," 
said Marj Helen Thuente professor of 
English and linguistics. "He has pub- 
lished his memoirs and maintained a 
high level of professional activities as 
a scholar and as a writer." 

Thuente hopes to schedule 
Woolf as one of the poets who will 
read in the faculty and student scries 
next fall. 

Woolf grew up in northeastern 
Arkansas and served in the Navy 
from 1942 to 1946. 

After leaving the Navy, Woolf 
enrolled in "The college of the 
Ozarks" in Clarksville, Arkansas. 

In 1949, Woolf earned his mas- 
ter's degree in English from the 
University of Michigan. 

He taught composition classes at 
the University of Kentucky and 
Wayne State University in Detroit. He 
taught at each college for one year. 

After leaching for two years, 
Woolf attended graduate school at 
Vanderbilt University in Nashville to 
earn his Ph.D. in English. 

He started teaching 19th century 
British literature and composition at 
IPFW in 1966 and retired in 1985. 

"He was unfailingly polite and 
gracious to his students. He was very 
formal but at end of the semester he 
would conduct a celebration. His 
wife made delicious and exotic baked 
goods and deserts, combining formal- 
it) with hospiialm. He still is active 
and is a frequent visitor to the cam- 
pus. He has been a good friend to 
my wife and mc and he follows the 
growth of our children," said Richard 
Ramsey, professor of English and lin- 
guistics. 

At 84, Woolf enjoys walking, 
calisthenics and eating out at Hall's

Faculty leads trip to 
Middle East, Greece 



by Gary Caudill, 
Staff Wnter 



If it's all Greek to them, it can 
be all Greek to you as well. 

That is, if you join the tour to 
Greece this June. 

The tour, running from June 
12 to July 1, will be hop-scotching 
over several or the Greek Isles, 
teaching participants the history 
or one of the oldest regions on the 
planet. 

You will be accompanied on 
this learning experience by two 
professors, Gordon Young and 
Robert McDaniel. both knowledge- 
able in the historv of the Greek 
Isles. 

When asked if there was a dif- 
ference in their fields of stud), 
McDaniel answered, "He (Young) 
lectures on ancient civilization, the 
history of the world until the end 
of the Roman Empire, ancient 
Greek civilization, ancient Roman 
civilization, ancient Near Eastern 
civilization. 

"His specialty is in the second 
millennium B.C., so he covers the 
waterfront in the Ancient World, 
and I pick up at the end of the 
Ancient World, about the coming 
of Islam... since about the 7th cen- 
tury', to the Ottoman Empire and 
modern Greece." 

The professors will be teach- 
ing a course on Mediterranean and 
Near East history' as you visit the 
sites involved. 

Both professors have been 
leading tours and teaching for a 
number of years, so they are well- 
qualified to do so. 

Gordon Young, assistant pro- 
fessor of ancient Mediterranean 
and Near East history, began lead- 
ing tours for Eastern Michigan 
University in 1978, and continued 
to do so until 1987. 

Young then switched his base 
ol operation to Purdue, West 
Lafayette, where he and McDaniel 
started a program. 

McDaniel says he has been 
teaching Modern Near East history 



for 35 years. 

In regards to his tour history'. 
McDaniel remarked that he had 
been in the Middle East every year 
except one since 1986. 

According to Denise Sheets, 
secretary, Purdue Center for 
Lifetime Learning, the tour will be 
departing New York for the Near 
East on June 12. and will be 
spending June 13-15 on the Isle of 
Rhodes where the Colossus once 
stood. It will then will proceed to 
the Isle of Crete, home of the 
ancient Minoan civilization. 

The Minoan civilization is 
thought to have been destroyed 
during a violent volcanic eruption 
in 1650 B.C. that occurred on the 
next island on the tour, Santorini. 
Santorini is called "the Aegean 
Pompeii." 

Tour participants will spend 
two days, June 18 and 19, on 
Santorini, where some like to 
believe the might) civilization of 
Atlantis once stood. 

After Santorini, the next stop 
for the tour will include visiting 
Paros from June 20-22. This will 
also include a da)' trip to the 
island of Naxos. 

June 23-25 will be spent on 
Nocomos with a day trip to Delos. 
an ancient center for slave trade, 
as well as a visit to the northern- 
most island of Andros, an upscale 
Greek Isle. 

On June 28, the tour will jour- 
ney to the Port of Rafina on the 
east shore of Attica and up to 
Delphi by bus to view the Oracular 
Shrine of Apollo. 

The next day, it's on to the 
Natural Archeological Museum or 
Athens, returning home on July 1. 

The total cost according to the 
Center is S3.295 (S4.078 out-or- 
siaie) which includes essentiall; 
everything but snacks. 

Travel and two meals a day 
are all included.

It is one of the unfortu- 
nate things about the business 
of sports. When teams don't 
win someone is usually held 
accountable. 

Both the Men's and 
Women's basketball programs 
had lackluster seasons result- 
ing in the termination of head 
coaches John Williams and 
Pam Bowden. 

The Men's program has 
wasted no time announcing 
new head basketball coach 
Doug Noll. 

The decision to hire Noll 
is one Athletic Director Walter 
Bowman hopes will take the 
program to the next level. 

Noll comes to IPFW from

The IPFW Men's volleyball 
learn has finished its regular 
season, standing at an impres- 
si\e 20-3 mark. 12-2 in the 
MIVA Conference. 

The win against South 
Hampton-Long Island 
University gave the Dons 
their twentieth win of the 
season. 

However, it was a game 
being played between MIVA 
schools Lewis University and 
Ohio Slate University that 
would have the biggest impact 
on the Dons' season. 

In the last game of the 
year, Head Coach Arnie Ball 
relied on strong play from his 
seniors most of the night. 

The Dons defeated the 
Colonials in Four games, losing 
a shocking first game and 
then making quick work of 
them with scores of 15-5, 15- 
4. and 15-9. 

With the win the night 
before against Ball State, the 
Dons picked up their twelfth 



conference win and waited for 
the Ohio State result.. 

The result was one which 
the Dons would celebrate as 
the)' settled for a two-way tie 
for the MIVA regular season 
conference championship. 

However, mixed emotion 
was definitely felt as the Dons 
were disappointed in them- 
selves with losses to Ball State 
and Ohio State earlier in the 
year. 

As a two seed the team 
will host Quincy University 
here on Friday at 7:30 p.m. 
with the winner traveling to 
Lewis for the semifinals and 
championship match. 

IPFW should be going in 
with the confidence it needs 
to win such a competitive 
tournament as this one, but 
with one problem. 

AU-American Hector Soto 
has a severe ankle sprain 
which has sidelined him for 
the past few weeks. 

Freshman Jeff Ptak and 
Scott Lane, who have been one 
of the most explosive fresh- 
man duos in the nation, will 
have to continue their team 



effort in light of Soto's injury. 

Their no-fear attitude and 
understanding of the game 
give them an advantage most 
seniors would like to sa; they 
have. 

Thai attitude is also 
instilled in Senior Javier 
Escobar. 

Escobar, who has perfect- 
ed power, speed and jumping, 
has combined the three to 
make himself one of the Dons' 
most prolific weapons. 

Also, junior Chris Gisslen 
will be instrumental in the 
team's success. 

Gisslen, who has been the 
team's captain this year, is 
also the team's play caller and 
the whole offense goes around 
him. 

Although he has pla)«J well 
throughout the whole year, 
Gisslen will need to stay focused 
on the task at hand if the Dons are 
to prevail. 

You can bet Coach Ball 
will have his troops ready to 
battle. Look for guys like Lane, 
Escobar and Ptak to step up 
their game and really perform 
come crunch time,
