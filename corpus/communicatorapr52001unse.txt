Renowned businessman visits campus 



One of Fon Wayne's most prominent busi- 
nessmen recenily visilcd IPFW. Ian M. Holland, 
retired chairman of the Lincoln National 
Corporation, spent Ihe neck of Match 19 speak- 
ing lo classes in IPFW's business depanmcnt. 

Throughout Ihe week. Rolland (poke lo 1 1 
different business classes and on Fnday he had a 
luncheon with the business school faculty. He 
spoke 10 many course lewis, ranging from intio- 
duclory 10 graduate. 

Because Ihe scope of his visil required 
addressing a vanely of topics. Rolland said he 
would confer with the professor and Uy to talk 
about subjecLs that related to their specific class 
structure. He said il was a "rigorous week." but 
nevertheless be enjoyed 11. 

Rollaftd is a native of Fon Wayne and grad- 
uated from DePnuw University in 1955 In 1956. 
he corned his maslct's degree An mathematics 
from the University of Michigan. He began his 
career at Lincoln Nauonal Life the same year. 
During hil 33 years there. Rolland served in such 
posiiions as chairman, chief eieeutive olllcer 
and president of the corporalion. While al IPFW. 
Rolland shared some of his eipenence and tried 
10 ciplain what 11 takes 10 become successful in 

Rolland said the goal of his lectures was lo 
induce discussion and inleiaeiian between him 
and the students and he said that, for ihe most 
pan. Ihis was successful. Orerall. 11 was a posi- 

"Ii was I rewarding etpenencc for me and 



1 hope it was for the students, as well." he uid 

Rolland had some valuable advice im ilic 
studcnis on how la become successful. He 
emphasized the imporunce of an education and 
building knowledge of how the business world 
operates. He also said thai interpersonal and 
communication skills arc important. A well- 
rounded person with Ihesc skills has Ihc potential 
of being very successful, according lo Rolland. 
He also suggested ihc imponancc of leadership 
skills, saying that his leadership skills evolved 
throughout his career as he gained more respon- 
sibility. "I Iried to share ihosc insights with stu- 
dents. They need a concept of leadership espe- 
cially 10 move to the top." he said. 

Rolland had plenty of good things 10 say 
about Ihe sludenls al IPFW. He said they were 
"inierestcd. curious, intelligent and warning 10 
leam." According lo RoHand. he enjoyed the 
imeraclinn between him and Ihe sludenls the 



He said he particularly enjoyed when inler- 
esled students stayed after class to question him. 
Because he knew Ihe students were inlereslcd 
and he was telling them something they wanted 
10 know, he felt this was the most worthwhile 

Rolland reured as chairman of Lincoln 
fJauonal Corporaoon in 1998; however, he is 
still very aclite in the communit) today. He is a 
board member of local organizations such as

According 10 Rolland. this visii was a very 




pioduclivc thing for him to do He said dial he 
jiojjcs he has conlnbuied 10 the education of the 
students. 

According to Rolland. Ihe week was a suc- 
cess. "It would be great if more Fon Wayne busi- 
ness people would do Ihe same " He said this 
would be a great way to increase Ihe business

"IPFW IS a real as.set to the community of 
Fon Wayne' Rolland said. ~aiul I am pleased lo 
be able to enhance Ihe educauon." He also says 
there are many oihcr business people in this 
commumly who have wide backgrounds and 
valuable e»j&gt;eiiences. "My wish is that they'd

Tell me again what 'LRC stands for? 




■ guess I just find it hard to believe thai Ihc 

kind of luck I've been having with LRC 
(Learning Resource Center) is just that — bad 
luck 

Several weeks ago, one of my classmates 
with whom 1 was working on a project sviole an 
editorial for this newspaper about LRC and the 
trouble we'd had in getting Power Point equip- 
ment delivered to class for a presentation, fn the 
edilorial. she wrote about the different contacts 
she made when requesting the equipment, and 
the various complications and contradictions she 
encountered along the way. Not only did our 
equipment not show up as scheduled (and con - 
nrmed), but the altitudes of the LRC staff left 
much to be desired. Wone, this had already hap- 
. pened several olher times to olher members of 
our class, whose situations, scenarios and com- 
ptainu wxrc nearly identical to ours. Our instruc- 
tor even pointed out 10 one of the equipmcnl 
delivery persons that wc would need Power Point 
prcscniation materials almost e«ry day for the 
rest of the semeslei. 

After the editorial, our class' equipment did 
stall getting delivered on a moi 
but it^idn't last for very long. 

(. working again in a group, my 
I were let down. One of our gnjup 
members called the week before and made the 
arrangements for equipment delivery. Having 
learned from the lessons and advice written about 



um to the gripes of the class), this particular per- 
son was armed, ready and competent to place the 
ever-so- important call to request delivery for the 
following week. But it was to no avail, 

Sunday evening, dunng our final meeting 
before the presentation, I made a phone call to 
LRC to see if, by chance someone might be there 
who could confirm our reservations. As it turned 

the office was closed for the weekend 



It surprising I, 



I left a 



(understandable ai 
message on the answering 
detailed all of Ihe necessities and essential infor- 
mation. I^ler. my colleague (who place the orig- 
inal call the week before) also called to confirm 
in hopes that someone might have slopped In to 
check messages, fix something or whatever. He. 
too, Icfi a message on the machine. 

Now it's 8:45 Monilay morning, I arrived in 
the classioam to find there was no cquipmenL I 
asked my group members whal was going on, 
and gol the same song and dance as has been 
beard ihroughoui the greater pan of this semester. 
Our contact person called LRC, who claimed 
ihey didn't get the message. Our two eonfirma- 






ifdie 



e regular basis 



ur previ 









person answering our panicked phone &gt; 
did not moke up for (supposedly) not reserving 
them in the first place. "You can't confirm somc- 
diing you've never reserved," he was told. The 
person Daily denied ever speaking with, taking or 
seeing any son of "original" message from any- 
one in our group. 

1 guess what troubles me more than any- 
thing IS not so much the semi-conns tent lack of 
delivery, but failure to admit Ihal perhaps, jutt by 



chance, an enur might have been made by ,«imc- 
one Olher than the person requesting equipment. 
Thai IS, in Ihe instances I know of this semester, 
whoever is spoken to from LRC accepts no 
responsibility for whatever shortcomings have 
come 10 pass, and does not admit it is even possi- 
ble Ihey may have misplaced a note or forgotten 
about It. Most often, diversionary excuses replace 
credible humility. The person making the request 
then ends up dealing with Ihe frusiration of hav- 
ing to prcicnl without equipment (or wailing on 
late equipment) and also feeling as though s/he 
has been called a liar. 

Good communication skills and personal 
accountability arc hallmarks of responsible cili- 
lenry and earned respect; whether you work at 
McDonald's, as a missionary or for the President 
of the Uniled Slates of America, these two trails 
alone can assuage and deflccl the most valid and 
volatile of many criticisms. When lacking, diey 
draw additional fire on both the person and in,sli- 
lution or organization with which the person is 
affiliated. 

Okay, so all of us make mistakes, nghl? 
Sure we do. every day. several times a day, in 
facL This article is not about people who make 
mistakes, forget things or gel things miied up In 
LRC's defense, our equipment was delivered— 
on lime for our 9 a.m. class— by not one, but 
three concerned delivery persons who made sure 
It was booked up and operational before they left 
the class. Also, not every aspect of the depan- 
mcnl exhibits this type or level of inclficieocy. 
Except for cases of equipment requests and con- 
firmations. LRC staff have been courteous. 



fnendly and helpful. In essence, ihen, ihc poten- 
tial for good relations is not only there, but in 
most cases thriving, which raises numerous ques- 
tions about the whys and hows of the dcpan- 
mcnt's structure and manogement. 

This article is aboul attitudes and responsi- 
bility. People and organiiations who make one 
policy, but cite another (when they drop the ball 
after someone fallowed their original policy) 
quickly lose respcci from those with whom they 
inleracl. Failing lo even acknowledge the possi- 
bility of personal error is one of Ihe final nails in 
ihe coffin, "Passing the buck," "deferment of 
obligation," whatever you want to call it— is rec- 
ognized by people of vaiying educational levels 
and backgrounds. 

LRC. as stated above, officially stands for 
"L,caming Resource Center," It hu been my 
experience, however, that an alternative— in the 
cases of equipment requests followed by lack of 
delivery— might be. "Lacks Real Concern." 
What does it take to get Ihe attention and belief of 
I his department? 

The problems with LRC seem 10 be in the 
initial and secondary lines of communication 
within die department iueir One further question 
IS nhat ought to be done on the request- makers' 

number of limes disappointments occur? More 
importanlly, will those standards be followed by 
die persons who name them? What can be done.

In a game that pro-

ellrcmcly close, going 
into eilra innings before 
a victor could be named. 

IPFW designated
