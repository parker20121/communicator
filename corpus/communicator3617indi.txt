Campus turns down the heat to save on energy bills 



By Todd Hamm, News Editor 

Room temperatures campus 
wide will soon be dropping as 
much OS four degrees as the uni- 
versity allempls to cut costs on 
its energy bills. 

Energy costs on campus 
exceed S125.000 each month, 
said David Danlelson, director of 
the IPFW Physical Plant- 

The cosl, though less Ihr- '-

lowered in the coming months as 
legislators attempt to ameliorate 
the stale's budget deficit. 

Staff from IPFW's Physical 
Plant, which maintains building 
temperatures, arc now in the 
process of turning down the 
more than 1000 thermostats on 
campus, Danielson said. 

Danictson^nid IhcgoaJ^is lo 
lower all room temperatures on 
campus to 68 degrees, 

'We went with some o( the 
stale and federal guidelines and 
68 degrees falls tvithin thai." lie said. 



Goth Ihe slate and federal 
governments place limits on 
how low or how high tempera- 
tures in publicly-funded build- 
ings can be, 

Danielson said lowering tem- 
peratures lo 68 degrees would 
save the campus anywhere from 
five lo 10 percent on its monthly 
energy bill. 

Physical Plant staff members 
started on the project in 
December and now have Kettlcr

Currently. Ihey arc workmg

"II takes a lot of man hours," 
Danielson said. 

He said the Physical Plant is 
also implementing other efforts 

"We do a lot of tummg lights 
off and we also do performance 
contracting." 

Danielson eKplaincd that the 
university employs independent 
contractors to "come in and do 
energy-relaled projects guaran- 
teeing a savings," 



"We have to look for any 

costs," he said, "I want lo ^et 
costs down farther. It is a nice 
opporlur\ity I o save the universi- 
ty some money so we don't have 
to cut on academic cosls."

From successful Wall Street financier to history student 



BLOOMINGTON. Ind, — (lU 
News) Bill Loreru! of Dodgeville, 
Wis., used to rub elbows with the 
likes of Henry Kissinger, Bill 
Movers, David Brodcr and other 
well-known authorities on poh- 
lics, economics and international 
affairs. 

That was during what Lorcnz 
calls his first career as a partner 
in a Wall Street investment firm. 
During his second career as 
founder of a management con- 
sulting firm ui boston, Lorenz 
and his associates provided mar- 
ket rescaKh lo a clientele — 
prised almost 



flv of 



Fortune 500 companies. 

These days. Lorenz, 62. is a 
student who gels up at 5 a.m. 
every morning and spends hours 
reading and writing about histo- 
ry in his rural home. 

Lorenz explained that his 
transformation from Wall Street 
partner and Boston management 
consultant to rural history stu- 
dent stemmed from his long- 
lime desire lo earn a college 
degree. 

^Mv iwo careers, bolh suc- 
ccsslul financially, helped me lo 
learn and grow as an individ- 
ual.' said Loren;. author or co- 



author of more than 20 major 
market research books, "But my 

quale, and Ihe lack of a degree 
always bolhored me," 

After retiring m 1994. Lorcn/ 
felt like he was al loose ends and 
started shopping around for a 
program that ivould allow him 
to earn his college degree with- 
out attending on-campus classes. 
He chose the General Studies 
Degree Program al the Indiana 
Uruversity Sdiool of Continuing 
Studies, The program, he saia. 
olfercd an excellent selection of 
distance education courses and 



accepted manv of Ihe credits he 
had earned from his previous 
academic experiences, 

Lorenz is one of more than 
18.000 graduates worldwide 
who hold an associate's or bach- 
elor's degree from Ihe lU 
General Studies Program, said 
of Continuing Studies 
Tunning, "Stud en Ls

courses on campus, at a distance 
through our Independent Study 
Program or through a combina- 
tion of distance and on-campus 
courses. Students enrolled in Ihe 
program al a distance can choose 



from 220 university- level cours- 
es, many of them available 
online. In fact, students can now 
complete all 60 credit hours lead- 
ing lo the associate degree 
entirely on Ime," Duruungsaid. 

Having earned his bachelor of 
general studies degree from lU 
in December, Lorenz is now pur- 
suing, through distance educa- 
hon. a master of arts degree in

Letter to the Editor 

; This is a reaction lo Nathan Diehl's column on "leader- 

. ship and morals." I have several issues with this essay. The 
'. autnor says "Bush doesn't waver," and Ihenproceeds lo say, 
; "1 Ic is willing to give a little to get a little," These statements 
• arc conlradiclory, or at least confusing. I understand both 
{.points, but he can't give Bush both stolidity and flexibility, 
I Clinton was criticized for giving a litlfc to get a little. Of 

t course, Clinton did much more than Bush did, delivering on 
I mon.' than SO percent of his campaign promises in just his 
first six months. Bush continues lo go against his own prom- 
) iscs, as evidenced by an article in last Thursday's Chrislian 
; icience Monitor citing Bush's campaign promise to brine 
i home as many troops as possible, when in fact, the United 
' Slates has a "global military presence.,, mo re pervasive than 
ever," including hundreds of military persoruiel in Russia. It 
sounds to me as though Bush not only wavers, he complete- 
ly swings around. 

Morals? We hove a president who is in the midst of Ihe 
. worst corpOfatl;! robbery in our history, involving not only 
""'mselibul l-l,olhcr members of his administralion. This is " 
crirfieifrantheir 



t bankruptcy his father had us bail him out of when he 
was in office over a decade ago. His morals extend only as far 
as Ihev can make him as much money as possible. It's like 
one of his Republican senators said when exposed by Sen. 
Licberman last week for having received on illegal campaign 
contribution, "That contribution came by Ihe grace of Cod" 
That's not morals, 

1 really believe the author when he says he "would nol 
want to fathom where the United States would be" if Bush 
hadn't taken Ihe presidency. He doesn't want lo falhom our 
having the kind of peace and prosperity the United States 
experienced during Ihe Clinlon-Gore years. Paying olf the 
national debt, generating jobs and working for peace are evi- 
dence ol real leadership. Bush and his corporate buddies are 
not interested in the good of all Ihe people, only that ol the 
rich. And the rest of us working people are paying for his 
profiteering.

Money: a measure of success, 
failure, satisfaction 



By Stephanie Sample, Staff Writer 

The journey begins when we are first asked the question, 
"What do you want to be when you grow up?" From that point 
on, we bcgm the process of elimination that eon last for 
decades. We start out with something like a sailor or a garbage 
man. The parents ate supportive. They think it's cute. 

Then you gel older, graduate high school and Ihe question 
changes from "What do you want to be when you grow up?" to 
"What the heck ate vou going to do with Ihe rest ol your life?" 
Suddcnlv, the thought oflheir son or daughter being a garbage 
man isn t nearly as cute as it used to be. 

1 envy those who know what they ^vant to be early m life 
and stick with il, because I still have no idea. All 1 know is that 
1 want to be successful and tliat I am terrified of failure. The 
problem is Itial 1 haven't discovered what "success " and "fail- 
ure" really mean lo me yet. 

T\vo of the scariest, most difhcull things to deal wilh in life 
arc success and failure. How we perceive these situations often 
determines the path (ve decide lo follow and the omount of 
happiness wc allow into our lives. 

The media and popular consensus would have us believe 
that success and failure are determined by money. If you 
believe that you need money to be successful, then you wQl 
most likely follow the path that is most likely to bring you the 
most ol cash. You have many choices; but remember, money 
makes people do strange thmgs. 

The corporale executives of Eruon were the kind of people 
who equated money wilh success. They compromised their 
integrity to get more ol it. Now the truth is out and one of the 
company's top executives recently conunitted suicide. 

All of the money in the world couldn't stop the shame and 
inevitable fall of a man who compromised everything and 
ended up wilh nothing. He forgot that the people you step on 
1. _ .L _**_.. J ; the same ones wait- 



u make your way up the ladder, a 
e money It 



md failure, 



Ihey also gamble with their own happiness. What if you work 
vour whole life for a huge bank account and you still aren't 
nappy? This would imply that one can be uiJiappy and slill 
feel successful. To me. this seems to contradict the whole point 
ol trying to be successful in the first place. 

To me, the people who seem Ihe happiest are the individ- 
uals who reject this common perception of success and failure 
and iiulead charmel their efforts into the things that bring them 
the greatest feeling of personal satisfaction. For many, Ihis is 
just having a job they don't dread going to every morning and 
being able to support the family Ihey love. 

For a select few. it is finding something Ihey are good at 
and feel truly passionate about — and gelling paid for it. These 
people are so lucky, t haven't met many people like ttiis, but the 
ones I have met seem the happiest and most satisfied. 

However, it must be said that when hard-working people 
who are passionate aboul whal Ihey do caimol adequately sup- 

Eort their families, then success and happiness are things no 
inger willun the grasp of all Americaiu— they are things con- 
trolled and suppressed by the very establishment thai prom- 
ised the opportunity lo gel these things in the first place. 

I am only a freshmen. 1 knmv I've got some time before 1 
really have lo stick wilh one thing. However, the desire for suc- 
cess and the fear of failure torture me constantly. My first 
semester ol college effectively taught me one very imporlani 
Ihing: The more mings I learn. Ihe more things I discover I am 
clueless aboul. 

I wonderif 1 will ever be satisfied? If not, 1 will continue to 
let Ihe desire for success and the fear of failure motivate me and 
guide me blindly through life. Nfaybe Ihis is what wc all do, 
shiving constantly for something that we believe will brine 
happiness and satisfaction, and trying again if il doesn't work 
the way we hoped il would. 

This, 1 think, is good enough. Maybe, in the fuul chapter 
of our lives, wc can look back and sec Ihat our hme here was 
nothing bul a series of failures and successes, and the fact that 
we kept going is perhaps the greatest success of all.

Often limes, the same people who say a piece of paper is all

of my polilical beliefs is tliat the Conslitulion was wrillcn lo 
be Ihe law and nol merely a guidebook. Tlic ftamers designed Ihe

Unfortunately, this statement no longer holds tnie because Ihe

The strongest reasoning lor my right tendencies is the way in which I 
view the national government, 1 view iljust as the Constitution says, nol the 
way the national government currently runs. 

I believe thai state govt'n&gt;ments were supposed lo have Tirul say over 
issues dealing entirely wilhin that state. Tlie fL-deral government was only 
supposed to nave a say in intcrstale activity. 

Consider the follo^ving excerpt from Barron v. Ballimore. 1833. Chief 
Justice John Marshall stated, "The Corutitulion was ordained and eslab- 
'ished by the people of the United Slates lor themselves, for their own gov- 
Tnment and nol for the government of the individual stales. Each Stale 
established a constitulion for itself, and in that constihition provided such 
limitations and restrictions on Ihe powers of its particular government as its 
judgment diclaled. -.The filth amendment must PC understood as restraining 
the power ol the general government, not as applicable to the State," 

Oops. Looks lo me lite the United States we know today isn't run the 
same as the United Stales m the glory years of Chief Justice Marshall.

Art Factory offers new stage for local underground artists 
New life injected into Fort Wayne entertainment scene 



On Saluiday, Jan. 26, Ihc 
doore lo Ihc underground were 
opened a\ full force when Ihe 
Art Fjctory hosted its firs) show. 

Bands from as far away as 
Dayton, Ohio, came lo play for 
the opening, where many fans 
showed Ihtrlr support by listen- 
ing and moving lo the beat oF 
loud music from such acts as 
The Unfofsaken, Dead Popes 
Society and Fat Ass. 

With the closing of many 
venues in the Fort Wayne area, 
such as Back Door and l)ic Loft, 
that hosted underground artists, 
it seems that this may be a good 
lime to a new such venue Ihat 
will attracl acts thai would have 
no other place to perform in Fort 
Wayne. 

One quallly Ihal fans will 
find altraclivc Li the (ad that the 
Art Factory is an oll-agcs (riend- 
Iv environment, 99 pctceol of 
the Lime, with llie only e(cep- 



tion being when there is a pn- 
vate parly booked. 

Dylan Gram of the Arl 
Factory said, "I remember what 
il was like not being old enough 
lo gel to see the bands 1 liked 
who would perform in Ihe bars. 

"The Arl Faclory is gieal 
because we will allow anyone lo 
listen lo the music Ihal they 
want to listen lo; no one will be 
thrown out," 

The idea for the Art Factory 
was conceived in Dec. 2001, 
when local artisi Diane Groeneit 
renled oul studio space in an 
office building on 340 E, Berry, 
on the comer of Lafayette and 
Berry, in do'vntown Fort Wayne. 
This localion is where the Art 
Factor)' now slands. 

Through Ihe support of 
tenants and local musicians 
Rupert Bomb and local artist 
Osos, Groenert was hosting a 
show (or Adrenaline Theatre, a

an all-ages environment. 

Since Ihal time, Ihe people 
of Ihe Art Faclory have worked 
hard to book as many shows as 
possible in Ihe future They have 
even scheduled shows into June, 
while still leaving plenly of 
room so more shows can be 
added at a later dale. 

One of the goals of the Art 
Factory is lo set up the schedule 
so that there is a show three 
days a week, allowing for fans 
to always have a place to go on 
the weelcend. 

"What wc wanl lo do is 
eventually have il so that there 
is a show every day of Ihe week- 
end," Gram said. "This will 
make il so Ihat everyone will be 
able to hear bands Ihat Ihey 
wanl to hear an^ make it so thai 
bands will have a place where 
their fans can find them," 



Alone with the all-ages 
aspect oi ihe Arl Faclory. anoth- 
er quality Ihal makes Qus venue 
fans-friendly is Ihe absence of 
advertising. 

The Arl Faclory has lefl il 
up to Ihc performances that take 
place lo sway Ihe fans as lo 
whether or not Ihey will return, 
or if they will wanl to see the 
band perlnrni again. 

The bands are allowed to 
sell their merchandise during 
performances, but there is no 
pressure put on Ihe fai\s lo make 
purchases. 

Also, the Art Faclory is a 

venue. This works well for 
bands Ihat wanl lo play Iheir 
music loudly. In addition, the 
extra space allows fans ample 
room to move about and carry 

Bui il is not just the fans 
who benefit. The Art Factory is

The website even boasts. 
"The Art Factory will support 
anything tlial anyone fee\i 
should be supported.' This 
means ihat Ihc aspiring film 
director now has a venue lo 
show his independent movie, 
the aspiring plavwrij 
new stage on which 
his craft and the local band ivill 
be able to take their sound out of 
Ihe garage and play Iheir music

On Saturday night, loud 
music was the specially, with 
mostly hanJcore rock bands

Unforsaken. 

The public had the oppor- 
tunity to witness firsthand, Ihc 
Eolcnlial Ihat Ihc Arl Factory 
as with respect to allowing 
entertainers to perform. 

For perhaps the first time, il 



Cing a 
Unfoi 



conceivable that there i 

Fort Wayne thai has 
lied for the artist, with 



the (ans m mind. 

Those (vho operate the Art 
Faclorv said they arc hoping to 
bicathe new li(e mto Ihe body of 
a local scene that has become 
disconnected . 

Wilh so many acts trying to 
find a place in which they can 
display Iheir works, whether it 
be a play, a sculpture or a song. 
il seems that some may have lost 
sight thai those artists arc there 
for the fans, according lo many 
attending the show Saturday 
night. 

The Arl Faclorv intends lo 
be the place where Ine artisi and 
fan can see and enjoy each other 
as equals.

—Youiheatre receives 
warm public reception 



The 



For 



Wayne 
^how of the 



Youlhcatre's third 
season, "Anne of Green 
Cables," opened Saturday 
afternoon al 2 p.m. lo a won- 
der(ul box office reception. The 
reception was so huge Ihal 
remaining tickets quicklv sold 
oul and a waiting list haa to be 
created lor both the Saturday 
and Sunday performances. 

Needless to say, the sell- 
out made a fitting tribute mark- 
ing Managing Director Harvey 
Cocks' 80 produclions directed 
while al Youthealrc. 

Based on the 1 90S novel, 
wrillen by Lucy Maud 
Monlgomerv, "Anne of Green 
Gables" tells Ihe slory of the 
Cuthberl family who hves on a 
farm eslablished on Canada's 
Prince Edward Island. 

VVhen the family decides 
Ihey need help man'agmg the 
(arm, they decide to adopt a 
boy from the local orphanage 
to help oul wilh Ihe chores 
foiuid on a (arm. You know, the 
basics, like milking cows, fecd- 
uig chickens, slopping o inkers, 
plowing fields, etc. 

The tale also lakes into 
consideration all the other stuff 
that ivould make people like 
me ivith chronic allergies con- 
vulse into seizure-causing 
sneezing fits, cough up out 
lungs and then keel over when 



our bodies finally decided 
they'd had enough. 

However, there is a mix-up at 
the orphanage and instead of 
Matthew Cuthberl picking up 
his new (arm lad at Ihe train 
station, he picks up a girl by the 
name of Anne, Mcnce, Anne of 
Green Gables. 

Alicia Knight is a veteran 

Brformcr of Youthealre, Civic 
ealre and several shows at 
Bishop Luers High School 
where she is a .senior and oflen 
plays Ihe lille role. 

In this production. Knight 
plays the ODle of the liltle girl 
from Ihe orphanage. When 
Marilla Culhberl. Ihe malemal 
figurehead of the family. 

3 u erics Anne about why she 
oes not obey her, Anne's 
answer is simply, "Some peo- 
ple in the world are naturally 
good. I guess I'm one o( the 
others." It was a line delivered 
with decent liming and elicited 
laughler from the audience. 

At limes, Aruie is also 
played as a drama queen when 
Ihe character calls for il. which 

Kalhy Pelter, who is no 
stranger to Ihe local stage, 
plays Marilla Culhberl. She 
rctums to the Youlheatre stage 
(or Ihe second time this season, 
playing the Cuthbcrt malri- 

Pcller is a ctiaracter actor 
who tias played a number of 
humorous roles, including 
amusing villains. Her liming 
and brassy personality read 



well to the audience who 
may remember Pelter as 
being one of their favorite 
characters. 

In "Green Gables' 
though, Mrs. Cuthberl is 
nol a villain, and she real- 
ly isn't supposed to be 
tunny. Peller seemed to 
be a little uncomfortable 
playing this part. II must 
be somewhat unusual, 1 
dare say difhcult, for her 
(o take on a role outside 
her traditional range. 

Having performed 
alongside her, it can be 
said that she is a Irue pro- 
lessional, Peller suffers 

and that suffering never 

However. 1 do believe Ihal 
Pelter oerhaps is best suited for 
comcoy and shouldn't play 
ight roles 



doti' 



,vlhis 



Bill Piercy plays husband 
Malthew Culhberl. He plays 
the character with Ihe usual 
humor aloof, unassuming and 
slow in reacting to the sur- 
rounding tvorld. 

Il's a good chafader; il's 
just thai the only difference 
between his portrayal of a char- 
acter in one show and his char- 
acter in a different show is the 

I have to admit though. 
Piercy had some touching 
moments in the show Ihal he 
managed to do proper justice. 

Andrew Alexander plays 
the schoolmaster wilh a mulli&gt; 
pie personality problem thai 
comes across as fiinny. which is 
the way it should be. The way 
he plays the teacher's pel with 
all ot^ the usual favoritism 
brought a smile to my (ace. 

All in all. Cocks has creat- 
ed another favorable show that 
has been well-received by a 
wide spectrum o( ages^ (rom 
pre-teen lo teenagers to elderly 
grandmothers who remember 
reading the same books when 
they were younger.

Partly to blame was Ihe 19 out of 58 (32,1

Delectable desserts at DeBrand's 



By Renee Thompson, Special Sections 
Editor 

With Valenline's Day fast approach- 
ing, the plaguing question arises: What 
are we going lo do lor Valentine's Day? 
Since people are usually involved with 
school, work, families and such, 
Valentine's Day sometimes isn't made 
out lo be such a lavish holiday. 

Valentine's Day can be simple and 
sweel: one couple, sweet dessert, a 
casual environment and good conversa- 
lion. Now, where do you go to get Ihe 
enjoyable dessert? None other ihan 
DeBrand's. Yes, they are known for their 
chocolates, but they are also very popu- 
lar when it comes to their sundaes. 
cheesecakes and even hoi chocolate. 



They have a dessen for everyone. 
Raspberry Romance (S5,50), a beauliful 
red-colored dessert, which is described 
as "a moist chocolale poundcake, lay- 
ered wilh a dark chocolate ganache and 
lighl raspberry mousse, then topped 
with [a| tart raspberry sauce." 

Another popular item, even in the 
dead of wmter, is Ihe DeBrand's Sundae 
($5.50). Made of vanilla tee cream and 
served in either a milk chocolate or dark 
chocolale cup. Ihe sundae is then 
served with your choice of tart raspber- 
ry, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, 
creamy caramel or crispy peanul butler. 
To lop it off, you can choose (rom either 
roasted almonds or pecans. 

I fell the need to order something 



loaded wilh chocolate and in the form of 
a pastry, I quickly scanned Ihe menu 
and found "Chocolale Lover's 
Cheesecake (55.95)." I like cheesecake 
and I'm a lover of chocolate. So, lor the 
sake of Ihis article alone, I fell the need 
lo order this one particular dessert for 
not only myself, but my significant other, 
as well. 

A few minutes later, the cheesecake 
was served, chocolate garnishes and 
all. DeBrand's menu described 11 as "a 
double layer ol rich, dense, silky 
smooth, chocolale cheesecake silting 
on top of a chocolate cookie crusi, gar- 
nished wilh stately chocolale curls and 
resting in wisps of mellow dark choco- 
late sauce." Needless lo say, the menu 



didn'i lie one bit. Rich, smooth, mouth- 
watering chocolate cheesecake, was 
artfully displayed on a plale decoraled 
wilh melted chocolale Even Ihe choco- 
late garnishes melted in my mouth. 

After a relaxed conversation with 
my boyfriend and nice long stares, 
smiles and laughs. I was able lo finish 
this chocolate lover's dream come Ifue. 
He, on the other hand, said even though 
it was a very delicious dessert, it was 
very hch and he was unable lo finish il. 

DeBrand's is located al 5608 
Coldwater Road and in Jefferson 
Poinle. Their hours are fiflonday- 
Thursday 10 a.m.-9 p.m., Fnday and 
Saturday 10 a.m.-ll p.m. and Sunday 
noon-6 p.m. 



^ Valentine's Day history, according to the Internet 



By Renee Thompson, Special Sections 
Editor 

When I lirst came up wilh Ihe idea to 
do my monthly special section on 
Valentine's Day, I thought it would be 
really nice to write an article on the 
Valentine's Day traditions and history. 
Unfortunalely, I was unable lo get a hold 
of Ihe history department, or get replies 
to my cnes for help (also known as e- 
mails). I even broke down and tried lo 
get a hold ol my priest. So, with all Ihis 



failure, one would think I would jusl give 
up. Not so. I was determined to find out 
something about this holiday of love and 
if that meant turning to every professor's 
worst nightmare, the Internet, so be il. 

After doing several searches and 
attempting to rule out Ihe uninformative, 
"I don't know a thing about history" web 
pages, this is whal I was able lo gather 
together. There are two main people 
involved wilh this whole Valentine's Day 
tradition: Emperor Claudius 'The Cruel" 



II and Bishop Valentine. The holiday 
began around 260 AD at a time when 
no Roman men were motivated to join 
the Roman army. Instead, they were 
more interested m getting married and 
having families. Needless to say, that 
didn't go over well wilh Claudius "The 
Cruel." He then outlawed all marnages 
and engagements in an attempt to suck- 
er men into military sen/ice. 

Of course, many were upsel and 
slill wanted to gel married. That is where 



Bishop Valentine comes in. He married 
people illegally until he was caught and 
sentenced lo dealh. While in jail, his 
supporters could visit him and he 
became good Iriends with ihe daughter 
of a pnson guard. So, on the day ol his 
execution, he wrote a letter to her, 
thanking her for her Ihendship, of which 
he signed it "Love from your Valenline." 
Now I have revealed Ihe history of 
Valenline's Day, according lo the 
Internet, 



Dating and Valentine's Day 



By Nathan Diehl, Staff Columnist you go lor months at a lime without any physical con- 

Since I'm not the type of guy who dates a lot, tact, or does your every waking moment revolve 
rarely have I celebrated Valenline's Day with ihal one around your bed? 



special someone. 

It's not that I don'l wanl to date, but more the fact 
thai I have a really hard time finding anyone with 
whom I fee! God wants me lo be. 

Every year, during the first hall of February, I won- 
der if I'll end up with an actual date for Valentine's Day, 
and nearly every year, I come to the same realization 
that I don't need to go get my nose stuck somewhere 
that God doesn't desire it lo be. So histoncally, my 
Valentine's Days have consisted of a night out with my 
guy friends. 

Valenline's Day should not just be a day Ihal guys 
go lo the llorist or head over lo DeBrand's to pick up 
some tine chocolates. 

Valenline's Day should be a reminder of how a 
relationship should be — each and every ol the remain- 
ing 364 days of the year. 

I believe thai, all too often, as college students, we 



When you slop grabbing onto the lirst thing you 
find that can fulfill some of your needs and desires as 
a human being uniquely designed by Almighty God 
you can sit back, waiting for that special someone 
with whom you can have a relationship basfed sole- 
ly on who the person is. Then you can truly under- 
stand just why we have continued lo celebrate 
Valentine's Day century afler century. 

This Valentine's Day, I have no doubt that if I 
really desired, I could get a date and probably even 
see some action. 

Fortunately, I have come lo the realization that a 
relationship is not about satisfying ihe desires ol 
human Itesh, but goes much, much deeper^inlo 
Ihe very soul and spirit of a person. 

Who am I to say that I won't have a date Ihis 
Valentine's Day? Who knows, God may decide to 
bless me with the company ol a wonderful lady with

that good looking guy or girl in psych class with a pair 
of arrows. 

We seem to want lo force ourselves into relation- 
ships, while refusing lo look loward the future and 
ignoring Ihe consequences for the temporary enjoy- 
ment of the moment. 

This type of shallow relationship is far from whal 
Valenline's Day should be. A relalionship consisting of 
dinner, movie and sex is not much of a relationship. 
Honestly"; I consid- 
er such a shallow 
mutual agreement 
closer to prostilu- 
tion than a true 
' , relationship.

Whether or nol I have a dale, I am quite certain 
Ihal my night will not contain the Iriple combo: din- 
ner, movie and sex. Dinner is good. Movie and sex 
are bad dating practices. Whal it would consist ol is 
a lot of talking and get- 
ling to know Ihis lovely 
lady whose compan- 
ionship that God has 
blessed me.
