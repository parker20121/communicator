The 4th annual Har- 
borarbor Days will be 
held May 28th through 
Hay 32nd. This annual 
event was started by 
the .Student Union Board 
in 1966 to celebrate 
the coming of Spring, 
and has been expanded 
every year to include 
more and more fun for 
all.

Communication BLAST 



Xion't you think it's 
about time we had a 
half-way decent dance 
at this campus? Well 
get ready for the big- 
gest blast after Spring 
break that you've ever 
seen I 

WHAT: A super, cosmic- 
charged, Communication 
Blast. 

WHEN: April 10, the 
Friday after Spring 
break. 

WHEBiJ: Student Lounge, 
Regional Campus. 
WHO: "The FAITH". 
WHY: The IU-I U COM- 
MUNICATOR has been down 
to its last penny for 
so long. We've finally 
gotten enough money to 
cover printing expenses 
at the Copy Center for 
the rest of the semes- 
ter but we base no funds 
for supplies to do the 
physjcal make-up of the 
newspaper. Like, have 
you ever heard, of a 



newspaper with two com- 
pletely handicapped 
typewriters! Thus: the 
dilemma! 

But the greatest 
thing about this danc&amp; 
is tbat all the colleges 
of Fort Wayne are par- 
ticipating in it. Ind. 
Tedh, Sam's Tech, lark- 
view, St. Francis, Con- 
cordia, and all the 
others! It's about 
time that the college 
kids of Fort Wayne grow 
up and have their own 
dance without having 
tcie teenyboppers run 
everything! 

So Be there! We know 
that it's about time 
somebody had a really 
super fantastid dance 
and we're going to do 
something about it! 

And the best thing 
about it is tho npicp. 
It is only frl.00 for 
guys and 75 &lt;? for girls!

Gregory has been i- 
dentified as a man with 
a mesa age of freedom 
and equality not only 
for the Negro, but, for 
the entire human race.

TOO MUCH STRESS ON COLLEGE- 

How. many times have 
you, as a student, wal- 
ked into a classroom, 
opened a notebook, and 
prepared yourself with 
a sharp pencil to take 
down those continuous 
wise sayings of the 
"scholar" in the front 
of the room? How many 
times have you said to 
yourself, "I don't want 
to go to this class to- 
day. I'm not getting 
anything out of it any- 
way. After all, I can 
mad the book, can't I?" 
but then decided that 
you'd better go or get 
docked for skipping 
class? How many times 
have you wished that 
you could take entirely 
unrelated courses to 
ymr field but which in- 
terest you? 

It * s ufortunate that 
our professors waste 
their time and ours by 
iedting the book to us. 
Can't they sell their 
subjects in any other 
way? Is the student sc 
ignorant that he has to 
be led around by the 
hand through his oourse- 
work? 

Why should a student 
be docked for skipping 
class because he's 
bored with it? Are the 
professors so lazy that 
they can't bring in re- 
lated materials from 
outside sources for 
"discussion" instead of 
lecture? 

The next time your 
professor takes a brea- 
ther while reciting the 
book to you, ask him to 
give you some answers 
to the questions I've 
posed. It might be in- 
teresting!

The °enate took action 
March 23 in taking 
away the extra alloca- 
tion of 4*2,500, because 
of the stipulation that 
the "Fifth bemension " 
was to appear. 

The entry forms are 
to be avaible Friday, 
March 27. They should 
have been out a week 
before vacation so work 
could be done over vaca- 
tion on certain projecte. 

Only time will tell 
if this years Harbor- 
arbor days are a suosss. 
The Union Board has de- 
voted much time and 
again only time will 
tell , it they spent 
enough time , ^ood luck

coming up in tne not 
to distant future is 
the social event or 
events of the year at 
IU-PU *ort Wayne. This 
event which is a trad- 
itional event at our 
Campus provides many 
opportunities for the 
students to show their 
skills, talents, and 
have some fun. So to 
make this years Harbor- 
arbor Days a sucess the 
most important element 
is the participator^ the 
student . So support 
Harborarbor days and 
get involved for you 
the students are the 
future of Harborarbor 
days. 

The Union Board 
dandies and plans the 
compxete event and it 
is this board that must 
do the grass-roots work. 
After attending a Union 
.board meeting, March 24, 
1 found that although 
plans are in motion the 
motion does not seem to 
be related to ttie time 
before Harborarobr days . 
One big problem has 
been money. Ho one 
seemed to Know the exact 
amount or just what was 
needed. This problem 
has two reets. First 
the Union Board should 
know what they need and 
second, the administra- 
tion should be able to 
provide an accurate 
accounting of money 
avaible to the Union 
Board. A problem was 
also created by the 
Board's miss-handling 
of the contract for the 
concert. This seems to 
be worked out but much 
was lost in time and 
money to the students.

Protest Our 

Freedom^ 

by Obie Booker 
Today, we, as stu- 
dents are protesting 
the lack of freedom, 
sexual freedon and ra- 
cial freedon. We pro- 
test everything from 
the Draft to chemicals 
in food. If we lived 
in a perfect society or 
world, there would still 
be protesting. Signs 
would read: "Too much 
love" , "Make war not 
love", "Hate don't com- 
municate" , "The water 
is too c}.ean" , "The air 
is too pure", "i rices 
are not high enough" , 
"Down with perfection, 
up with pollution", and 
"Take a shower with a 
friend and arown your- 
self '.' . 

Why demand more free- 
dom, when we are not ta- 
king advantage of the 
freedoms that we now 
possess. 



We are remonstrating 
about academic freedom. 
We want ttie freedom to 
choose our own subjects. 
We want a part in the 
precess of hiring and 
firing teachers. We 
complain about the high 
cost of our activity 
fee. Therefore we don't 
take advantage of what 
is available. We don't 
support our student 
newspaper. We don't 
attend the movies or 
plays. Yes, we want 
more freedom but we 
don't respect the free- 
doms of others. To- 
day in the student 
lounge , we had two vis- 
itors — Marine Becruiters . 
A student jumped up and 
called them "facist 
pigs, mother rapers, 
and child killers" . We 
want to get rid of the 
draft — but we will not 
want to pay for a vol- 
untary army. We takl 
about pollution but we 
don't clean up when we 
pollute the cafeteria 
and the student lounge. 
iet, we complain about 
the lack of freedom. 

We are complaining 
about the lack of sec- 
ual freedom. At the 
same time, we dislike 
the thought of inter- 
racial marriage. The 
men dislike the square 
girl (virgin) but we 
want our future wives 
to be untouched. 

We are expostulating 
about racial freedom. 
We have the freedom to 
love all people. we 
have the freedom to 
meet and discuss . If 
all of this seems dis- 
organized, jumping from 
subject to subject and 
unpredictable, we have 
communicated.

placed as a subordinate

Emphasis was placed, 
however, on the fact 
that much assistance is 
needed from all over the 
world in order to combat 
the deaths from "slow 
Creeping starvation of 
almost the entire pop- 
ulation." The acceler- 
ation in the deteriation 
of the nutritional re-

the entire population is 
acute. Statistice in-

of all children under 4 
years of age are suffer- 
ing from nutritional 
edema which is a measure 
of advanced protein de- 
privation, and tiigt 31*3% 
of the entire population 
suffered from the same*

Goes On 



by Dan Syrnonds 
The past school year 
Circle K has been work- 
ing at the Fort Wayne 
Children's Home with the 
delinquent children gges 
9-14. They take the 
childpen out to various 
places, such as; to 
parks for ice skating 
roller skating, placing 
basketball, and etc. 
The purpose of Circle K 
in this project is to 
try to give the boys a 
good example. Ble pres- 
ident said, "The boys 
at t e home are very 
talented in athletics 
as well as other things. 
Truthfully the only 



thing different between 
those boys and other 
boys is that the boys 
at the Children ' s Home 
got caught." 

Circle K is also hav- 
ing a swim party April 
4 at Club Olympia from 
10 to 12 midnight. 

'-^he District Conven- 
tion of Circle K will 
be held at Tri-State 
College April 10, 11,1^. 
I resident Daniel C. Sy- 
monds informed the paper 
that Ken Scott, a Cir- 
cle K member, will run 
for Govenor and Steve 
Sours, current secretary, 
will run for District 
secretary. 



BRAVE IT, BABY! 

— by Steve Kirshner 

On Saturday March 28, 
1970, fourteen brave 
students and two profes- 
sors of I.U. Fort Wayne 
will embark on a per- 
ilous mission to Ark- 
ansas-a real live gea- 
logy field trip! 

This journey is sup- 
posed to give gealogy 
and earth science stu- 
dents practical exper- 
ience in field condi — 
tions. This situation 
is made more exciting 
due to the fact that the 
Ozarks have recieved 
two feet of snow, then 
rain and follds, and 
finally ten more inches 
of snow in t e last two 
weeks! You can't get 
more demanding field 
conditions than this, 
to test aspring young 
rock hounds. The trip 
is to last for nine 
whole days, or maybe 
longer if we get lost! 

Another complicating 
factor is only spending 
one might in a motel 
and sleeping under the 
stars the other nights, 
or snould I say under 
the snow! We might end 
up in the Mississipppi 
River Delta in the morn- 
ing! Another testing 
situation is trying to 
squeeze eight people, 
all their luggage, and 
piles of rock samples 
into a nine passenger 
travel-all and still 
breath. Oh well, this 
will only make the trip 
more challenging. ^y 
the way; if anyone 
would like a slightly 
used rock hammer about

Tell of 

FALSE Statements 

Students for Biafran 
Relief announced on Feb. 
27, that any statements, 
detrimental to the Ni- 
gerian Red Cross are now 
highly falsified. SBR 
Commends the efforts of 
the Federal Nigerian 
Government and the Ni- 
gerian Red Cross to al- 
leviate the conditions 
of starvation in the for- 
mer Biafran enclave. 

It was stated by SBR 
Director, Tom Hamilton, 
that recent reports from 
Nigeria and Geneva indi- 
cate that the Nigerian 
Red Cross is progressing 
at its best under the 
direction of Mr. Zaid 
Mohammad in Lagos. 

There is an xenopho- 
bic Nigerian determina- 
tion to save their own 
face in the entire post- 
war effort. They will 
accept aid from abroad, 
But on their own terms 
and in their own dignity, 
with need subservient to 
that. Each attack, hor- 
ror story or announcment 
of foreign material from 
outside Nigeria only re- 
sults in denial and re- 
versal of quiet agree- 
ment. Foreign medical 
teams can work virtually 
at will in the enclave

Qj\&amp;&lt; k&gt; 



In 1967 a group of 
Port Wayne college stu- 
dents collaborated and 
came up with the idea 
Q f nne organi nation of 
all Fort Wayne colleges 
This idea became a re- 
al ity when the Fort 
Wayne ounci 1 of Colleges 
( F ". VI . . . ) wp s formed. . 

The purpose of this 
group is as follows: 
t i0 R ej^p as a co-ordi- 
natinn- body between the 
student governments of 
the nrP3 colleges, and 
to serve as an arena of 
communication, whereby 
the student governments 
benefit bysharinp ideas 
and orovidiup an oppor— 
tunity for interaction 
and to serve as a liason 
between the oollepe stu- 
dents and the community 
Out of the ten col- 
leges comma sinn- the 
Council, unfortunately 
only five compose the 
hard core group. "If 
the F . W . C . G . can pet the 
majority of Fort Wayne's 
14,000 students behind 
it, we will then be able 
to do somethinp in the 
way of services for 
these 14,000", stated 
Tom Newman, chairman of 
F.W.C.C. . 

At the March ^Pnd 
meeting, the first thi np 
accomplished was the e— 
lection of a vi ce-obai r- 
man. Georpe Gordon was 
accepted by acclamation 

Next 'followed di s- 
cussion on anew type of 
discount, one directly 
from the factory. The 
F.W.C.C. undertook the 
discount card project 



tnisyear. Discount is 
fiven by several stores 
in the Fort Wayne area. 
A grour. is in the process 
of beincr picked to in- 
vestigate this factory 
discount. 

Next week, the plans 
for a leadership Re- 
treat will be completed. 

Georpe Gordon then 
introduced a few new 
ideas for the Council, 
one of them belnp- a new 
Bet-up for the F.W.C.C. 
A committee of Georpe 
Gordon — Chairman — Ind. 
Tech. ;Tom Newman — I.U.- 
P.U. ; Jim Bobay and 
Randy Everett, both frac 
Sam's Tech, was formed. 

The group will also 
work on an idea for a 
radio ^ro n " p ai"i to pub- 
licize upcoming activ- 
ities planned, by the 
Council .

Antj- Draft Meet 

Late Friday after- 
noon, March 20th, about 
75 people gathered in 
front of the Federal 
Building for an anti- 
draft meeting. 

The speciality of 
this raeeting was speak- 
er Paul Mack from In- 
dianapolis. Mack is a 
member of an Indiana- 
polis group which last 
year burned 1-A draft 
files there. 

Designating the 
draft " int imid at ing " , 
Mack said, "we get the 
feeling someone is 
trying to plan our 
lives breeds alien- 
ation. " 

This alienation he 
explained, is resol- 
ved when people such 
as the group at this 
anti-draft meeting 
could "band together" 
and "educate others." 

At the meeting, one 
draft card was burned 
and one boy stated he 
was absolutely "not 
boing to be drafted." 
This drew a cheer from 
the crowd. 

oongs from the mu- 
sical "Hair" were sung. 
After Mark's speech, a 
committee member stated 
his hopes that the 
group would continue 
to mobilize now that 
it has come to the at- 
tention of the public. 
After Mark finished 
speaking, donations 
for his trip from In- 
dianapolis an^ other 
expenses were collec- 
ted. Then Taps were 
played and the meeting 
ended.

Here's What 
YOU Said! 



With Harborarbar Days 
coming up in May, it's 
still in the planning 
stages and this is the 
time to look at it ob- 
jectively, '•'■'hus , the 
question for this week 
is: jJo you think Har- 
bor arbor Days is worth- 
while? 

Michael a. Herron -H ar- 
borarbor Days are indub- 
itably necessary for the 
furtherment of unity &amp; 
the dissipation of ap- 
athy here at Indiana- 
Purdue University, stu- 
dent involvement is 
practically nill here, 
what we need is more 
programs and social 
\ functions to create an 
atmosphere and a sense 
of belonging to this 
campus-in a word, this 
campus has a goal- to 
erase the word "apathy" 
which is written in big 
red letters 01 the walls 
of this educational fa- 
cility. 

Cindy oieminski Yes , 

from the standpoint 
that it gives students 
a welcome change of 
pace from classes, it 
lets them participate 
with faculty members in 
outside activities, and 
could be similiar to 
Dloomington spring 
weekend if students 
participated. 
Kevin Uieger -Yes, it is 
worthwhile because on a 
campus this small com- 
muting student body,

campus activities are 
limited. This is one 
of few annual events 
which is provided for 
the benefit of all stu- 
dents to participate. 
Jim Meyer - I think' Har^ 
borarbor Days should be 
continued. It's one of 
the biggest activities 
of the year, and it 
gives all students a 
chance to participate 
in one or more phases. 
The road rally and the 
various races are es- 
pecially interesting. 
Charon Snearing — Yes . . . 
very worthwhile... just 
because you don't go to 
Bloomington doesrfT mean 
you shouldn't have some- 
thing like Ilarborarbor 
JJays. The weekend 
could be really great 
if more kids would par- 
ticipate and volunteer 
to help. The only pro- 



blem is that too many 
students gripe about 
the' activities that are 
planned, but these are 
the people who gripe 
most about the acti- 
vities. Everyone could 
be involved by planning 
or just by attending the 
activities planned. 
James A. Roehm — If this 
year's ilarborarbor Days 
is anything like last 
yearS bash it should 
really be quite the 
bash. Personally, 1 
dug it! Especially 
Friday afternoon's ses- 
sion; the tug-of-war , 
outdoor dance, and other 
events were well attend- 
ed and organized. My 
only criticisms were 
that the canoe race was 
too long and the road 
rally was laid out by a 
sadist. Any way, the 
sooner it comes the bet - 
er! ! ! ! ! iCont. on pg. 51

Trying to get axoixg 
with ■ people is some- 
thing we all do every- 
day,' but there are two 
m en on this campus who 
make careers of this 
n-rpnt feat. The refer- 
ence is to our two very

time has done every- 
thing from writing 
speech material for two 
povenors and a mayor 
to managing publicity 
for two community the- 
atres — the Festival 
Music Theatre of which 
he was 'the general man- 
ager for sever years 
and the Civic THeatre 
for two 7/ears. 

During the years 
194P-1946 Fir. Culp be- 
came exposed to public 
relations at Internat- 
ional Harvester where 
he wrote stories about 
the development of 
trucks and the romant— 
oism of industrialism, 
promoted and publicized 
war bond rallies, and 
wrote for Interna tional 
Harvester's magazine.
