Free pizza and assorted IPFW 
goodies brought students to Keitler Hall 
in flocks during recent Homecoming 

"I have never turned down anything 
free, so 1 would have waited in line for 
an hour. But it only took me fifteen 
minutes to get some pizza. I even got a 
free pizza cutter, window scraper, and 
T-shirt, so I was pretty pumped up." 
said Jarod Fetehier. while explaining 



his 






This kind of giveaway is not an 

everyday occurrence, but Homecoming 
week brought in loads of freebies. 



Thursday featured free Pupa Johns 
pizza and a t-sbirt trade-up. If a student 
brought in an old college t-shirt, they 
received a brand new IPFW shirt that 
sported the line "I traded UP" on the 
back This was a very popular attraction, 
especially for a Thursday, which usually 
seems quiet around campus. 

"Thursdays usually suck, but in 
high school. I had to pay $ 10 for my 
homecoming shirt.'' Feichter said. 

"It was free here, plus I got a ton 
of pizza and free stuff with it. Why not 
wait around? To me, it was worth it." 

This event was also a great place for 
people to register lor Hie tree drawings, 
which were selected at halftime of the 
Homecoming game. 



Voting tor Honiei inning i|iieeu and 
king took place as well. 

Some of those running lor 
royally were in the vicinity trying to 
sway voters in their favor. One of the 
lathes running lor i|iicen even bribed 
voters with candy as they approached 
the voting box, 

The action didn't slop there; as the 
pi/^a excitement Idled the basement, 
the first floor quickly tillered people 
through the Smoke-out campaign. 

This event was held by numerous 
groups and organizations to convince 
smokers to drop the habit. The

and WelliicssChnic, 11'IAV Department

offered a graphic brochure with

smoker who had cancer, the handout

This attraction, just like the 
Homecoming festivities, offered 
plenty of freebies. Booths handed out 
everything from stress balls, to candy.

what was going on, campus. 

The students that were able to take 
part in the activities were impressed. 

"I didn't think that there was 
going to be as much going on as there 
was. I loved all the free stuff; I didn't 
even care what it was. Anything free 
is exciting. I think Homecoming is 
important because it boosts school 
spirit, and makes your day a little more 
exciting," said one sophomore. 

Students could not receive free 
items without their student ID cards. 
While some students appreciated this, 
others thought it was inconvenient. 

"I know the purpose of asking for 
the ID cards is to prevent non-students 
from getting the free stuff. But I didn't

No Need To Fit The Entire Season Into One Day 



By Stephanie Sample; 



As many of you know last week 
was the official beginning of the 
Christmas shopping season. Last 
Friday, the Fridav afler Thanksgiving 
is olien referred lo as Black Friday. 

This day is when all of the anxious 
shoppers come out in the early hours 
to eel their place in line. 

In past years these lines have been 
for Carebears, Cabbage Paich Dolls, 
and most famous of all the Tickle 
Me Elmo This sear seemed to be all 
about the video games. There were 
new systems games, and it seemed 
like everyone was in a hurry to get 

I decided on Friday to stay away 
from the mall, deal me with (he crowds 
in ihe morning did not sound like a 
good time to me. Later in the day I 
did go out and even ill ihe evening the 
malls were still packed. 

This whole event got me thinking. 
Why is everyone in such a hurry? 
isn't enjoying all of the aspects of 
the holiday season, what it is really 
all about? I 

know that -omelunes shopping t au he 
a pain, but is it necessary lo do it all in

one day, and be so intense while 
doing it' I even saw a video ol two 
men gelling in a list fight over a toy. 
What child would want a present that 
then parents received by punching 
someone else in the face. 

It amazes me ihe ihuigs ili.u people 
get excited about. A breakthrough 
story in the news, or the recent 
election gels less air time than the 
discounts at Wal-Mart. 

I like anyone else !o\ e a great deal, 
but I don't feel the rush and I realize 
important things than 



do in the holiday season besides shop, 
so it would be wise to make sure you 
make time for a carriage ride, ice 
skating, or any other favorite holiday 
activity.

lying enough, here's another newly- 
uncovered conspiracy: Christmas is 
actually all year round. Wow! I guess 
those little towns in Germany had it 
right all along. 






What little towns you may ask- 
Exactly. 

So. you wake up early in the 
morning, it's Mill dark outside, and your 
family unites and plots ihe morning's 
events to a T-bccause on Black Friday, 
there is an itinerary. And as we all know, 
everything lh,it is planned and assumed 
to go well, miserably falls apart. 

You're two hours late already, 
but it's okay. So is everybody else. 
Lucky for you. Aunt Edna camped out 
at Kohl's last night. A quick phone 
call might take one item off your list; 
however, you quickly realize thai your 
cell phone can't reach anyone because 
everyone in the USA is calling their 
Aunt Edna. Aunt Edna, on the other 
hand, had too much eggnog and turkey 
in'the car, which has ran out of gas. 

You finally hit Coliseum Boulevard 
two hours behind schedule your worst 
nightmares arc a reality. The parking 
lots arc packed. This morning will 
become a batlle-iiicrally a struggle of 
man versus vehicle. 

As we know, there are ti

look closely, we actually turn down the

rules because of our animalistic 
tendency for property We linally spot 
a parking visual, but so does that other 
lady. The kids in the hack scat tense up, 






knowing that something is going down, 
as you take note that your signal light 
was on first. The lady glances at you. 
turns her head, and swerves in. You 
.iutom.tik.ilh go into Shaniqua modi: 
and say. "I know she didn't!!" You're 
usually the one who doesn't step out of 
the car and confront, but you see your 
fellow family member Hading their 
amis in what appears to be a gibberish 
of body language that seems to be 
escalating the situation Your family 
wins the battle, and a good story for 
the grandchildren is founded. 

You finally make it into the mall. 
which has turned into an ocean of 
sardines The mall is an interesting 
domain; it is a place where patience is 
tested, teriyaki chicken is distributed, 
and-worst of all-a place where you 
can run into old 'friends,' 

These friends are no match for the 
creme vendors close to the fountain. 
You all know whom I'm talking about 
You always pass them, internally 
laughing at Ihe people who they have 
trapped into their dialogue schemes, 
and wondering how much their 
business grosses in a day. 

Black Friday comes to an end and 
you conclude that when it comes down 
to it, every day is a Black Friday. 

There are no solutions to shopping 
lor other people. We can only change 
our initial perception so thai our self-

Cigarette Tax: Un-Republican 
Move for Governor Daniels 



towards hc.dlln are and . 



The next legislative session in ih 
Indiana Slate House promises to b 
revolutionary in terms of the ways i 



■.The 

source of the upcoming whirlw md- oi 
change is none other than the Gover- 
nor. Mitch Daniels. 

For a much-criticized politician 
who many dismiss as a lackey of 
President Bush, this proposal is 
a radical departure from prc-con- 
ceived notions of the Governor's 

The most startling of the Gov- 
ernor's plans is the proposed imple- 
mentation of a subsidized health " 
plan for low-income Hoosiers, fi- 
nanced by an increase in the taxes col- 
lected from cigarette sales. 



-smoking 



But, the most startling fact is that his 
plan intends to insure those Hoosiers 
who earn less than twice the poverty 
level, or $40,000. 

There is already a plan in operation 
in Indiana (Hoosier Hcalthw ise) w inch 
insures children; however, the limit 



"Conceivably, if the plan 

is successful in curbing 

smoking, then less revenue 

would be generated for the 

health plan." 



would be generated tor the health plan 
But will smokers unit smoking if ciga- 
rettes cost 50 cents more per pack? Not 
likely. 

The current state tax on cigarettes 
is 55 cents, which is much lower than 
the tax in many other slates, including 
Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. 

Those who smoke in those stales 

continue to smoke, even those who 

do not drive to Indiana to purchase 

In New York, the price ol ciga- 
rettes is nearly double the price in 
Indiana, and smoking is no longer 
allowed in bars and restaurants. 

So, the likely result of the tax 

hike would be to allow smokers to 

— finance the Governor's new health 



This 



: first t 



t the 



Governor has proposed an increase in 
the cigarette tav hut this time he cites 
a goal of a healthier Indiana. 

As reported in the Journal Gazette, 
"there is no strategy for a healthier 
Indiana that doesn't involve reducing 
smoking." 

He has promised (hat 100 percent of 









on earned income is much lower and 
leaves most adults uninsured. 

There are currently about 500,000 
uninsured Hoosiers, and Daniels said 
in the Journal Gazette article that "if 
the lax on cigarettes is raised 2^ cents, 
the state could help provide insurance 
io 120.01 K) uninsured persons." 

A50-CCni hike would insure almost 

halt HI uninsured Hoosiers. and so on. 

Conceivably, li the plan is successful 

in curbing smoking, then less revenue 



Or-as the Governor points out-if 
people do reduce their smoking due to 
the higher prices, then people will be 
healthier and will have lower health- 
care costs which need to be insured. 

Whatever the result, the impetus lor 
this plan— "a healthier Indiana"— is a 
very tin Republican, almost socialist, 
goal for the citizens of Indiana. The 
unlikely source ot this proposal implies 
that there is more lo Mitch Daniels' pri- 
onues than is publicly-portrayed. 



Democrats: New Faces, Same Issues 



By Matt Middleton 

Bitter fighting questionable lead- 
ership and outrageous legislation 
sounds like the profile of the current 
lame-duck legislature, right'' Actually, 
these problems have already beset the 
110th Congress, which doesn't even 
start meeting until January! Il begs 
ihe question ot whether or not Ameri- 
cans really voted to change course, or 
simply elecled new faces to the same 
troubled body. 

The difficulty began for Speaker- 
elect Nancy Pelosi just days after the 
election when she publicly backed 
Representative Murtha (a combat 
veteran who is known for being a fel- 
low Pelosi leftist) lor House Majority 

He may have done a good job, 
but Pelosi really needed to think this 
one through before jumping the gun. 



Could such a controversial man really 
lake Ihe reigns as majority leader in the 
House when Democrats are preaching 
the gospel of bi-partisanship? 

This is a congressman who caus- 
tically called for the immediate with- 
drawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, which 
contradicts every single high-level 
military suggestion. In addition, while 
his fellow Democrats set their sights on 
campaign linance reforms, he carries a 
scared reputation from being involved 
in the ABSCAM bribery investigation 
in 1980. 

Following her quick vote of confi- 
dence in Murtha. closed-door elections 
were held in which Murtha was cast 
aside in favor of moderate Democrat 
Steny Hoyer. Though the leadership 
held a press conference exclaiming 
their unity and new-iound leadership. 
Speaker Pelosi was smiling through 
the egg on her face. 

Not only has this power struggle 



shaken the vision ot internal demo- 
cratic harmony, but il has also called 
into question Pelosi 's effectiveness 
as a leader even before she officially 
takes power. 

If all this weren't enough. Repre- 
sentative Raugel of New York has said 
he will propose (as he did in 2003) 
io reinstate a military draft. He says 
that if a draft were to take effect, it 
would serve as an important buffer for 
politicians to stan war on speculation 
Though a recent poll reveals that 7 out 
of 10 Americans oppose the draft, he 
vows to press ahead with the legisla- 



tng. 

Now, knowing that Ihe new Con- 
gress will face many challenges in Ihe 
near future, and caution must be taken 
to fix their predecessors' mistakes-noi 
lo create a whole load of new ones.

Bleak Friday: Unnecessary 
Event for Consumers 



By Jessica Ruckman 



The day after Thanksgiving, known 
atfeclionalcly as Black Friday, is a day 
in which businesses rake in Ihe huge 
bucks and get their balances back in 
the black. I am up at 6:00 a.m., bul 
not to stand in line for hours like sonic- 
crazed lunatic. 

As I chug my first cup of coffee, the 
lifehlood of my shocked system. 1 flip 
on the news jusl to see il anyone has 
been shot yet over a PlayStation 3. 

As the newscasters play a reel 
about ilic idiots w ho camped out, I re- 
peal, CAMPED OUT. for their entire 
thanksgiving holiday just to be the 
first to gel in the door. 1 fell my break- 
fast attempting to creep back up and 
offer me a refund. 



Cans 



e please tell me why so 
many consumers feel they must force 
their way through mobs of crazed, 
coupon-clipping madmen, jusl lo save 
ten measly dollars on the "newest &amp; 
hottest" items? 

Jusl what is so important that 
someone has to ruin the besi and mosi 
fat-tastic holiday of the year? 

I think to myself as I drive to work, 
stuck in a 6:30 a.m., shopper-induced 
traffic jam, lhat perhaps (and this is 
jusl a suggestion-who actually takes 
advice anyway?) we as Americans 
need to reevaluate our penchant for 
ovcr-lhe-top materialism, and the need 
to get the bigger, better deal before 
anyone else does. 
Stop and think: doesyourovcrweight

How many of those houses hud 
children who had no winter coat lo

houses had people who couldn't even 
afford a good 
breakfast? 

In this season of "giving." I say put 
the Playstation down, gel yourself and 
your overweight, spoiled rotten kids 
out of the house, and donate some of 
your lime and your generosity to help 
someone who will appreciate it for 
more than a few days, 

In doing so. you may just pass

chairperson Jessica Patterson said. "It will 
make the walls a more interesting plate." 

Patterson is also the librarian of line 
arts and engineering at Helmkc and has, 
along with other library workers, been 
starching lor a way to liven up the library 
and increase student involvement on campus. 

"I think that it will be really interesting 
to see that a biology major, for instance, 
docs art," Patterson said. "Maybe it will 
actually bring mure people into the library." 

Currently, the project is looking for entries 
of rcudy-to-be-hung two-dimensional artwork. 
However, the committee hopes to accept 
ics in the near future.

Festival of Gingerbread Displays, Sweet

The wonderful, spicy rich scent 
of gingerbread wafts down the stairs 
of the Fort Wayne History Center. 

It's Christmas time - and 



Gingerbread, sponsored by the 
Fort Wayne Historical Society. 

This year, the courtroom of the 
old county courthouse (e.g. the 
History Center) displays 130 
gingerbread creations in twelve 
different categories, from pre- 
K thru second grade to culinary 
student and professional. 

Designs range from the Happy 
Feel penguins and candy-encrusted 
trains to a three-story pagoda 
and the McMahon lire building, 
complete with Kit Kat car lifts. 

The vanetiesoteandy used isdazzling 

- mints, Twizzlers, chocolate coins. 
Teddy Grahams, pretzels, shaved 
coconut pine trees, sugar cookies 

- there's probably a sample of every 
lype ol candy known to Ft. Wayne. 

It's also interesting to note the 
architecture and artistry of the 
gingerbread One designer made a 
three-foot -wide toy box. complete 
with a stick horse, Etch-a-Sketch 
and Raggedy Ann doll. A stack of 
dceorated cook its also ill ustrales'The 
Twelve Days of Christmas" crowned 
with 'a partridge in a pear tree.' 
But perhaps the most enjoyable 
displays to see are the kid's 



stadium filled with roaring Teddy 
Graham fans, a small Boy Scout 
Lanipgvomid. a series of pyramids 
and a scrumptious collage Hanked 
hy two rnarshmallow snowmen. 

It's evident that kids decorated 
these works with enthusiasm 
- and their favorite candies. 
As part of the gingerbread display. 
the courtroom is decorated with 
Christmas trees, pine garlands, lights, 
and elves and dolls in tiny chairs 

"We started (decorating | 
on November 8," says Leanne 
Mensing, coordinator of the 
Festival of Gingerbread, 

"li lakes us one week approximately 
to get all the decorations up. I have 
a mens crew that gels all ihe stuff 
ami brings n in - garlands and trees. 
I The | ladies come in and decorate 
the trees and add all the decorations." 

This is the twenty-first year 
[of the festival]. Last year, it 
took 7.000 hours of volunteer 
work with eighty volunteers. 

Some of the decorations, like 
the elves and dolls, are ironi the old 
Wolf and Dessaur store Paintings 



Carol" are also on display as a 

gift from Sam Fletcher, son of 
the former owner of the Patterson 
and Fletcher department store. 

A doll house maker has 
even reproduced the Wolf and 
Dessaur store-complete with 
Christmas decorations-to be 
part of the Festival's display. 

Adding to the ambience of the 
gingerbread display is the courtroom 
itself, with us grand wood paneling 
aiidso.uirigeeiling Heeauseofagr.ini. 
pan of the room has been restored to 
its former grandeur of cream walls 
with maroon and gold detailing. 

However, the process of 
restoration is labor intensive and 
exacting - the original paint must be 
replicated perfectly, using original 
ingredients. As a result, the grant 
ran out before the painting job did. 
"If you have a million dollars 
to finish it, we'd be glad 
to take it," says Mensing. 

The Festival of Gingerbread 
will run through Dec. 9. Exhibit 
hours are Monday thru Thursday, 
9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.; Friday 9:00 
a.m. - 8:00 p.m.; Saturday and 
Sunday 12:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. 



Horrorfest: Christmas for the Horror Fan 



By Mike Webb 

Anyone attempting to see a movie 
at The Rave from Nov. 17-19 was 
likely greeted with several movie 
choices they had never heard of (and 
likely never will again unless they like 
to rent low-budget horror flicks). The 
event was Horrorfest, also going by the 
moniker of "Eight Films to Die For." 

What was so special about these 
eight films'' For one, they would not 
have been shown if it were not for 
this event. The Web site claims they 
arc "too graphic or loo disturbing for 
general audiences." 

Obviously, they were made to be 
seen; however, the companies passed 
on them and the rights for each were 
snagged by a company known as After 
Dark Films. 

The movies were shown across the 
states in 500 theaters in only 35 cities. 
Luckily, one of these was Fort Wayne 
(don't ask me how that happened). 

"Dark Ride." '■Reincarnation," 
and "Unrest" were all shown on 
Friday night. "Penny Dreadful," "The 
Gravedancers." and "The Abandoned" 
followed on Saturday night. "Wicked 
Little Things" and "The Hamiltons" 
ended the movie festival on Sunday. 
Anyone with a love for Snoop Dogg 
could check out Snoop Dogg's "Hood 
of Horror" as a bonus film on Sunday 



night but it will nol be included in our 
look at the original eight tilms (that is 
the one I didn't go to). 

So what about these movies? Are 
they really so graphic and scary? Well, 
that depends on several factors such as: 
what niovie(s) were chosen, what type 
of movies scare you and whether or not 
you were sitting close to anyone who 
laughs at scary movies to help keep 
their cool (there were several of those 
people). 

The majority of these movies were 
not so scary and I would not expect 
to see them on their own. They were 
definitely low-budget movies that 
were not made to exist within certain 
taboos. 

Take "Unrest" for example. This is 
a movie that takes place almost entirely 
in a hospital morgue. The movie is 
scary due to atmosphere and concept, 
and there are not many "jump out of 
your seat moments." However, the 
imagery is gory and chilling, especially 
when you consider that some of the 
body parts represented in the film are 
rumored to be real. 

Then there is Takashi Shimizu's 
"Reincarnation" (or "Rinnc" as it is 
known in Japanese), a movie about 
seventeen people who are murdered 
and are somehow drawn hack together 
in their next life. Like "Unrest." the 
imagery is often unsettling. But it is Ihe 



concept thai is scary (not to mention 
Ihe fact that the him feels foreign and 
will not necessarily feel comfortable 
to those who are used to the typical 
Hollywood horror flick). 

These movies were not all winners. 
Anyone unlucky enough to buy a ticket 
to sec "The Gravedancers" knows 
exactly what 1 am lalking about. 

This movie had so much potential. 
not to mention extremely disturbing- 
looking gliosis. But it was all thwarted 
by the noticeably horrible acting, the 
exceedingly cheesy story line, and a 
supporting character who made bad 
jokes at nearly every potentially scary 
moment in the film. Not surprisingly 
the audience laughed through most of 

1 would also place "Penny Dreadful" 
and "Wicked Little Things" on the list 
of movies to pass over as well. These 
movies just didn't seem like they 
offered anything outside of the norm 
and aren't even executed in the most 
effective way. 

Surprisingly. "The Abandoned" and 
"The Hamiltons" ended up being the 
scariest of ihe bunch. This is surprising 
because these were Ihe two movies 1 
knew nothing about and considered not 
even watching. 

I will not give them away olher lhan 
to say that "The Hamiltons" is a fresh 
take on an overused concept in cinema 



and "The 

haunted house atmosphere I have ever 

When these two films come out 
on DVD, rent them without question. 
There is talk of these being released 
individually and together in a package, 
set within d-X months from now. 

Anyone into horror movies should 
consider looking into' The Abandoned." 
"The H ami lions. ' Reincarnation. ' and 
"Unrest"-in that order. "Slasher ' fans 
can also look forward to "Dark Ride,'' 
but the rest of the films could slip by 
without causing too much of a void in 
anyone's life. 

Before I go on, I 
should discuss why 
I actually went to all 
eight of these films. 

Perhaps it's 

because I love horror 
films. Or maybe it's 
because this sort of 

seem to happen 

around here. 




Would I do it all 

again? The a 

is no. I don't know if yofl" 

have ever seen several n 

all 

nights, but as much fun as I had, 1 

found myself missing the ability to do 

other things (like go to bed and that 

sort of thing). 

Overall, Horrorfest was an 
enjoyable, non-typical experience. 
Here's hoping for Horrorfest 2007 (and
