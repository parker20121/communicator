Perpetual political candidate Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. offers theories 



Chef ttqxirler 

Lyndon H LaRouche Jr. has 

a conspiracy theory about Sept 
11, 2001. 

It had to be an inside job by 
someone to ignite America into 
war wilh the world. He called it 
a "coup" against the American 

"The purpose of the coup 
was lo bring into play what [Vice 
President Dick) Cheney represents 
in terms of his policies and his 
friends' polices now," LaRouche 

That's the theory. And he 
wants to find the conspiracy It 
had to be a very high-level 
capability II was not ,1 slop-job 
done by a bunch of ambitions 
Arabs," he said. 

Elect him to the White 
House, and the truth will be 



known, he claimed 'As president, 
I will find out what was behind 
Sept 11 I'll gel to ihe bottom of 
it, as 1 think every other honest 
president of the United States 
would do," LaRouche said. 

LaRouche. who is running 
for the Democrat nomination for 
president, held a webcast tele- 
conference with about 40 college 
journalists Thursday, including 
reporters from Syracuse, Ohio 
Stale. UCLA and IPFW. 

Hehasmadea bit of .1 second 
career out of running for federal 
government. LaRouche has 



as a Virginia senator. He lost that 
election, but he noted, his 
campaign derailed Oliver 
North's senatorial ambitions. 

LaRouche's words against 
the current administration slice 



right through President Bush's 
request for a "new lone" in 
U'.ishin&gt;;lon. His nickname for 
Donald Rumsfeld is "Bugsy" 
and for [ohn Ashcroft, his nick- 
name is "The Crisco Kid." He 
laughs and said Newt Gingrich 
swaps spit" with other Bush 
administration officials. 

Bul much of it isn't funny. 
Not surprisingly, since he Ihinks 
9/11 wasn't an attack from out- 
side enemies, he believes things 
will get much worse before Ihev 
even start lo get better. 

He claims America may 
even go to nuclear war with 
enemies and Allies The intent 
now 'from the Cheney crowd' is 

that they are committed 

ventive war in any pli 
feel like a Hacking. They 1 
war. They want Ihe killing — 
this targeting of Islamic people is 
simply that. ' LaRouche said. He 



: Ihey 



said ihe .tiimini*tr.ition wants to 
use nuclear weapons to bring 
about world terror and a world 

"They will use nuclear 
weapons. They will seek war 
ivht-ie ihere is no provocation. 
Who knows, they might even 
make an attack on France It's 
not impossible. I don't think it's 
likely in the near future. They 
would love 10 put nuclear mu pons 
down the throat of Jacques 
Chirac. " he said He claimed it's 
a "Hitler-like mentality." 

The Patriot Act is something 
, 1 hi mi which he also worries The 
Crisco Kid (Ashcroft) is not my 
hero. Il doesn't make any Sense. 
The kev Imi-i.j del.'Rie for security 
of the'Unitcd Stales is local law 
enforcement. Good, quality law- 
enforcement — the cop on the 
beat — Ihe policeman who is 
professional and has a feeling for 



the community," he said. 

Cross cooperation is needed 
between local departments and 
federal departments, but the 
Patriot Act is not needed, he said. 
"What we need is basic law 
eni.TCi.menf. We concentrated 
money in (his crazy idea of a 
super agency, this sort of 
Gestapo kind of thing, as 
opposed to strengthening the 
basic capabilities we have and 
know how to use," he said. 

Along with thai, America 
needs lo W revit.di/ed economi- 
cally, LjRouche said. The United 
Stales needs lo be retooled in 
terms of it= employment and 
productivity. 

"We've destroyed ourselves 
as a nation internally. (The 
Midwest) used lo be a lol of 
industry. What about it now? We 
used to have a population which 
was vigorous," he said. 



He said America's

He thinks ihe United States must 
be "mobili/cd" to do water and 
transportation projects, alone 
with other public utility areas. It 
is something that could be cycled 
through 25-year investments. 

He saj'd he hopes sludents 
will find his campaigning efforts 
useful in their decision making 
for the Democrat nomination 
and the presidency in 2004. 

LaRouche claims support

What happened to professionalism? 



and acting 
pro fission a I manner? It wasn't 
until this semester that I finally 
realized that professionalism 
is quit kly being pushed down 
the drain by the excuse of just 
being too busy. When did people 
become too busy to do their jots? 
Quite frankly, I wish I could 
just be handed a paycheck. 
Since the first week that 



have been trying to get into a 
class lor this that requires a 
professor's signature. 1 called 
the professor and she never 
returned my call. So I E- 
mailed her, and she wrote 
back saying that she will 
lorward my information to 
another professor who is 
opening another section of the 
class. End of the E-mail. No 
professor's signature, no 
lurlher E-mails, nothing. 
Weeks pass by and not a word. 
Through .1 friend. I heard 
that another class was opened. 
So again. I called the professor 
al least three times, and never 
received a response. I left 
numerous voice mails and not 
one was returned. I called her 
secretary who transferred me 
the profe 



Well, seeing as how I, too, 
thought that taking one of my 
required classes would be a 
good idea, 1 figured that we 
might get somewhere. 
Apparently this professor had 
been so busy that she didn't 
know that all three of the 
classes were full. 

I realize that being a 
professor means having a lot 
of responsibilities, papers to 
grade and meetings to attend, 
but what happened to uphold- 
ing business etiquette? It's a

mails, phone calls and voice 
mails. How busy can a person 
possibly be to not return a 
phone call or voice mail that 
was left by a student seeking 
assistance? Well, on a good 
note, after a month of voice 
mail messages, I finally 

I have also noticed that 
this thing called customer 
service is lacking at several 
establishments One grocery 
store in town has forgotten 
that without customers, they 
wouldn'l be around. 

Their job is to serve the 
customers. Last month I was 
in a local grocery store lo buy 
soda for the office. 1 went 
down the aisle, saw a sign that 
said Pepsi was on sale and 
thought I scored a good deal, I 
went up to pay and it rang at 
regular price. I explained to 
the cashier that there was a 
sign directly above the Pepsi 
that said "Pepsi S4.99," and 
she proceeded lo tell me that I 
was wrong because it was on 
sale last week. Holding up the 
line (because heaven forbid 
they have more than two lanes 
open throughout the day), she 



out searching for a Pepsi sale 
sign. It was right below the 
many cases 0/ T'epsi, clear as 
day. Instead, it was much easier 
for them to blame it on a 
customer rather than admit 
that someone didn't do their 
job. What customer service! I 

Sot blamed for someone who 
idn't do his job. 

Verbal communication is 
vitally important in business 
as well, but yet I have noticed 
that very few younger busi- 
nessmen are actually using 
formal language. Instead, I 
find that they are using 
profanity and slang in inter- 
views and meetings. In my 
mind, any sort of profanity 
used during a meeting is 
unacceptable and diminishes 
a person's profess.onal 
appearance. 

No matter how many 
phone calls. E-mails or voice 
mails these individuals 
respond lo, it will make no 
difference because they are 
ruining their own profession- 
alism by using words that can 
be offensive to others and are 
often seen as the result of a 
limited vocabulary. 

All in all, I'm sad to say 
that pro less ional ism is being 
lost because people are just 
too busy to take the time lo 
watch their language and 
return calls. Also, I'm sad to 

slowly dying in this country. 



For what it's worth: 

Drugs: Just say d'ohl 



There's a simple reason I 
don't do illicit drugs. 

For the benefit of elementary 

schivilers and Nancy Reagan. I'd 
like to sav it's because 1 "fust Sav 
No." but that would not be 
completely true. 

The simpler reason is that I 
don't manage In proper! V Like rnv 
prescribed medication, so I'm not 
goitif; 10 risk anvlhing that comes 
without any instructions. 

As it is, 1 just suffer from the 
inability to read the infractions 
on the box of medication — until 
I'm trying to figure out what 1 
have nisi done to my body after 
ingesting the drug. 

Ironically, when I'm eating a 
bowl of cereal, the bos can become 
more enthralling to me than a John 
Grisham novel. 

Now, I don't pop a lot of pills, 
but there is one ailment that 
hounds me like flies in .1 land field 
no .1 •.learning day. 

Allergies. 

I never had .illerpi-- growing 
up in Indiana. Never had them 
when I lived in Southern 
California — but when I relumed 
here, allergies were in my 
Welcome Home" kit. 



I don't think I used these 
in ed notions in improper ways. I 
wasn't freebasing or stralghUinlng 
my over- (he-counter products — 
just taking Ihem in the prescribed 

At least, 1 tried. 

My first "mis-experience" 
with medication was an oierdo-e 
of sorts. This wasn't intended, nor 

Well, okay, it was a little 
funny — but it wasn't a major 



overdose, lust enough to zoink me 
so I looked less like me and more 
like a very sleepy Potsy 

This happened on a day 
when I was supposed lo be 
helping an ex -girl friend move 
from one apartment lo another 
She moved so often 1 thought she 
was in the Witness Protection 
Program — or is really Osama bin 
Laden — but that's a whole other 
column. 

Up lo this point, I had been 
taking regular-strength antihista- 
mines, but had just run out. So I 
went and purchased more. 

Now, unbeknownst to me 
(this would be because I didn't 
read the package closely, or at all); 
these were extra-strength antihist- 
amines. Instead of taking two 
every eight hours, I only needed lo 
take one every 12 hours. 

So, not reading the package, 1 
swallowed two. Silting on a 
couch, I read the package. 1 
remember thinking, "ljh. 1 only 
need lo take one of these every 12 
hours. That's cool." 

And then I thought "D'Oh!" 

1 told my girlfriend — she 
"- dshe 
lethe 

pharmaceutical company along 
with myself. 

"Urn. I think I mieht be feeling 
like I want to lake a nap here," I 

That was at about 10 a.m. 

About 8 p.m., I woke up — 
still on that couch I was the only 
thing that hadn't been moved 
from the apartment. I felt like I 
had noi contributed to this move. 
Which I hadn't. Instead, I fell like 
I'd slept on a pillow of tacks and 

My second bad antihistamine 
experience look place a few years 
later with the same girlfriend. At 
that point, she had moved six 
times. This had been in three 
weeks. Just kidding, but il sure 



seemed that way. 

At that point, she was an 
actual lawyer _ which means 

she'll sue me lor mentioning her in 
a. column. Libel or slander or 
something. 

I was hanging out at het 
house and fell the onset of a sinus 
headache A bad one — like 
scissors stuck in my forehead. 

We found some antihista- 
mines and I made sure they were 
regular-strength. That discovered, 

I swallowed two of them along 
with a Coca-Cola. Ten minutes 
later, I felt nauseated — like I was 

being forced to read a romance 

I went lo the bathroom and 
looked at the instructions. 1 had 
done everything right. ., except I 
look two pills thai wen.- expired in 

early 2000. And it wasn't early 

2000 anymore. 

Apparently those expiration 
dates are on there (or B reason. I 
was sick for a while, then felt like 
a turtle in a tornado the rest of the 
day - moving slow while 
everything spun around rr 



then to an igloo and then back lo 
the home where I was suffering. 

Now, there's nothing Funny 
about these experiences, II is 
important to read the instructions 
hetorv ingi-sling any medication — 
unless you are a columnist who 
needs to make mistakes like these 
lur column ideas. 

What I fear is I'll someday 
make it big, move out lo Los 
Angeles and have a sinus 
headache I try to get rid of quicldy. 

When they tag my toe with 
"overdose," 1 fjoiu want Nancy 
Reagan and everyone else thinking 
I was just another one of those 
deaths ot someone abusing drugs 

I wasn't abusing drugs I just 
forgot to read the instructions

Hammond laughed. 

He spoke about university life and 
working toward dreams — his was

Hammond said his 2.1 CPA wasn't 
a good Ihfng coming out of college. He 
admitted 1i&lt; partying loo much during

They also appreciated having the

All that jazz: A diversity in music 



Aii enjoyable afternoon of "j.i/_z diversity" 
was held at Nell Recital Hall on Sunday, April 27 
at 2:30 p.m. Under Director Farrell Vernon, the 
IPFW department of musics T.i// Ensemble blew 
cool and hot jazz for approximately one hour 
According to Vernon, the selection of the jazz 
numbers presented were chosen to "be as diverse 
.issibfe." I can personally attest to that fact. 
The 18-pieie ll'FW ].&lt;// Ensemble consisted 
of three women and 15 men displaying their 
musical talents through solos and features in their 
program ot nine detinilit e \,\// numbers. 

"Friday Night at the Cadillac Club" started 

musical journey through "jazz land." This 

■a! number featured Aaron King on trom- 

■, Jason Symington on tenor saxophone-, Doug 

Laughlin on drums Each row of musicians were 

dueling with each other throughout this exciting. 

rhythmic ^election. 

The following number, "Hoi It Up," featured 
Kristen Douwman on alio saxophone and Colin 
Clifford on trumpet ,&lt;■• Ihcv transported us to the 
French Quarler in New Orleans. Clifford was a 
stand-out with his trumpet playing. Conductor 
Vernon staled this •election was of the "second 
line" group that features swing beat music 
teamed up with a march tempo for a very 

"That Warm Feeling" featured Fred Feiple on 

f ilano, This fine and mellow melody was about as 
lid back and smooth as jazz can get. 

The next two numbers featured lodge Daniel 
I loath as guest vi-calisl en two Frank Sinatra stan- 
dards: Cote Porter's "I Get A Kick Out Of You" 



and Jerome Kern s "The Way You Look Tonight 
which he dedicated to his wife and "half 01 the 
audience who were related to him. - " Heath made 
these numbers distinctively his and obviously 
enjoyed performing them. 

Johnny Mandel's "A Time For Love" was a 
musical roller coaster that featured the gifted 
Marcus Farr on trombone, building and backing 
off the emotion of this lender selection. 

Asa group, the IPFW Jazz Ensemble selected 
"Basically Blues" as a piece to include in their 
program, and they were very justified wilh this 
dynamic jazz selection. In this well-known 
Buddie Rich signature number, drummer Sean 
Rollins was featured along wilh |enie Kechel on 
tenor saxophone. Feiple on piano and Farr on 
trombone. This was my favorite selection in the 
program. The downbeat, the playfulness of the 
"blues" and the lin.il build to "bring it home" 
made this number memorablc. 

A Johnny Mercer tune entitled "Emily" was a 
haunting, mysterious melody that ieatured King 
on trombone and Feiple on piano. The music 
began quietly and softly and built to a big finish, 
ensuring we would remember her name. 

huttie featuring Bryan Osborne on trumpet, Fan- 
on trombone and Rollins on drums. I compliment 
Osborne on his talented playing — it was remi- 
niscent of watching Harry James play. I cannot 
forget Rollins who again proved to me that Rich 
was channeling through him with his excellent 
drumming skills. 

A delightful afternoon of hot and cool jazz 
was had by all who attended this very compre- 
hensive tour of jazz land, courtesy of the IPFW 
Jazz Ensemble. It was real cool, man! 



the skit, he was again portraying 
Clinton, and it was time for Kim to kiss 
"the real" Monica Lewinsky. 

"How do you categorize that 
famous face, and all that it's famous for. 
coming towards your own? It got to 
about right here (he held his hand close 
to his face) and I heard (Clinton's voice) 
say 'Surprise,'" he explained, sparking 
laughter. 

He explained to the crowd that his 
original intention was to become a voice 
artist for cartoons — something not 
quite appreciated by a military family 
in a military town. His father would 
catch him practicing his Porky Pig 
impersonations as a child. 

"My father would stand at the 
door and say, 'What in the G-damn 
hell? Margaret that son-of-a-b**" is 
doing it again. I gua ran -damn- tee you 
that son-of-a-b"" ain't normal. I think 
he's queer,'" he said. 

Hammond told the crowd he 
considered joining the army at one 
point, but things didn't quite work out 
when he drove to the recruitment center 
in a boat. 

Still, he's happy he is on America's 

"They can push a button in an 
underground bunker in Colorado. 
Another 20,000 miles away, a missile 
comes up. It goes another 15,000 miles, 
finds the correct street address 
(Hammond knocks on his microphone). 
'Yes? Candvgram."' he smiled, paying 
homage to a 1970s "SNL ,r skit 
"Landshark." 

Through the night, Hammond did 
impersonations of politicians Al Gore, 
the Iraqi Information Officer, George H, 
W. Bush, George W. Bush. Dick Cheney, 
Donald Rumsfeld, Jesse Jackson, the 
Kennedy family. Bill Clinton, Al 



impression of Colin Powell. 

"Did I do him?" he asked referring 
back to "SNL" where he has done over 
90 characters. "Did I do him well!" 

He also mimicked celebrities 
Connery, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 
Crocodile Hunter. Johnny Cochran. 
Regis Philbin, Robert DeNiro, Richard 
Dreyfusand media 
icons Tom Brokaw, 
Donahue, Chris 
Matthews and Ted 
Koppel. Fictional

FORT WAYNE. Ind. — Darrell 
Hammond owns a degnv in advertising 
It was never really a*back-up career 
for him. He had the degree, but thinks 
he would have gone into comedy, 
yen if he hadn't become successful 

I made up my mind that 1 was 
fling to do it," Hammond explained 
allowing his show Friday at IPFW 

The "Saturday Might Live" 
comedian admitted he didn't expect 
to make a lot ot money in his profession. 
Even though he had the "sensible" 
degree, making people laugh was 
what he wanted to experience 

'The truth was 1 wanted to try to 
be funny So I finally decided to work 
as hard as 1 can to be as funny as I can 
and maybe someone would pay me. If 
I was poor, i was poor, but at least I 
was doing something I really loved." 
he recalled his decision. 

For Hammond, another "SNL" 
alumnus is one of his main influences, 
Eddie Murphy. 

"He's one ol the best impressionists 
I've ever seen," Hammond said of 
Murphy. 

But it's just not Murphy's work 
as an impressionist that Hammond 
appreciates. It is the way he sets up 

"He made sun 1 lh.it each impression 
was funny. It's one thing to do the 
voice, it's another to find a joke for it. 
And that's always been the challenge 



"1 like doing stand-up," he said. 
Hammond also says he enjoys college 

"Being in a college crowd, the 
laughs are so immediate and so hard. 
They have so much energy — it 
makes you feel tunnv And that's why 

(do it' he explained. 

He goes on the read and .

Stormed as well as I ,ould ivrlorni, 
immond noted 

After retiring from "SNL," he 
hopes to do more dramatic roles. He 
has already nclei 
Special Victims Unit." Scheduling 
conflicts interfered with him performing 
on another episode of "Law and Order 

"I want to be a good character 
actor when I finish. But you can' 
always count on that II that doe-n' 
happen, I can at least lookback al this 
and say it was really great," 
Hammond concluded 



also a part of his repertoire, including 
Charlie Brown's teacher, Porky Pig, 
Darth Vader, southern characters and 
delivery room nurses. 

His stand-up routines included 
references to the birth of his daughter, 
life in the tabloids and life in New Yurk 
City. He also asked several students 
about their college careers in an interactive 
night, mentioning people majoring in 
elementary education, geology a no TV 
production. 

."It was really funny, and it was 
good how he got the audience really 
involved," Stone added. 

One student who almost became 3 
part of his routine was IPFW finance 
major Billy Foreman. Foreman had 
shouted out a Connery quote, confusing 



Hammond and much of the crowd. 
When Hammond understood the refer- 
ence, he laughed. 

"That story?" he said. "I was trying 
to learn (the Connery} voice. My friend 
Will Ferrell was working on Alex 
Trebec. and for reasons that arc slill not 
apparent (11 me, 1 turned to him and 
said, "You're not a big fan of the ladies, 
are you. Trebec?"' he mimicked 
Connery. "Who knew that would be 
funny?" Hammond continued. 

Several limes, Mammund returned 
his thoughts to Foreman's jabber and 
his friends in the crowd. 

"We're going to keep an eye on this 
guy." Hammond said, joking wilh

Rockets beat Dons, Dons beat themselves 



i 



Toledo beat the IPFW 
softball team in the opener of 
Monday's doubleheader at the 
IPFW softball field. 

But the Mastodons beat 
themselves in the nightcap. 

The Rockets used a five- 
run fifth inning to blast the 
Dons 9-2 in Game 1, and 






rs and just four hits by 



•FW gave Toledo a 2-0 shutout 
in the second game. 

"We haven't been hitting 
the ball like we should. It prob- 
ably started against Ball State 
(April 22), and we're a better 
hitting team than what we 
showed today," said IPFW 
coach Keith Fisher. "We just 
didn't hit the ball, and that's 
what happened. We made a 
couple errors in the second 
game and you can't make 
errors against any team, and 

The Mastodons' defense 
got off to a good start in the 
second game. Dons starter 
Mindy Pomeroy started the 
game by fanning the Rockets' 
leadoff hitler Audrina Mailer, 
and Vicki Nelson followed by 
grounding out to Pomeroy. 

Toledo's Gina Muratori 
then knocked a routine 
grounder to Tierni Green at 
second base and the ball 
sneaked under Green's glove 
and then past Lori Faurote's 
glove in right field. The errors 
were enough for Muratori to 
advance to third. A single to left 
field by Jenny Schaaf scored 
Muratori to give the Rockets 
the early 14) lead. 

In the top of the second 
inning, Toledo s Kim Pettitt led 
off by reaching first on another 
error by Green. Tiffany Edgar 
then laid down a sacrifice bunt 
down the third base line to 
move Pettitt to second. She 
continued to round the bases 
when Kate Moiim connected 
for a single to center, and Pettitt 
scored on an error by Maggie 
Bruening at short stop to reach 
the final score of 2-0. 



IPFW (17-24) tried to rally 
in the sixth and seventh 
innings. In the sixth, the Dons 
picked up two quick outs 
before fenna Beachy singled to 
center field, follow^ by a walk 
by Laura Randolph. Heather 
DeVore then connected with a 
Pettitt pitch, and while runners 
were advancing, Beachy was 
forced out at third to end the 
inning. 

"We ran into an out where 
we shouldn't have from second 
to third that got us out of the 
inning," Fisher said. "We 
shouldn't have done that, but 
that's softball, and we'll 
regroup tomorrow. It's our last 
game and hopefully wt 
a lot better." 

In the bottom of the ! 
IPFW again picked ui 
out when Faurote lee

Grabtzak followed with a fly 
out to center field. Pomeroy then 
advanced to second on a wild 
pilch before Green went down 
swinging to end the game. 

Grabcsak led IPFW in 
Game 2 with two hits. Beachy 
and Pomeroy each had one hit. 
Pomeroy (6-11) took the loss for 
the Maslodons, allowing two 
runs on four hits. She also 
struck out six batters and

"We've got a lot of great 
s. Our pitcher, Mindy 

2, probably pitched one 
etter games that she's 
pitched this season, but we 
didn't help her with the bats," 
Fisher said. "When those type 
of things happen, if s really sad 
for the pitcher. You make errors, 
and that just kills the pitcher. 
But we're going to regroup, and 
we'll be back here tomorrow." 

In the first game, the score 
was knotted at 1-1 heading into 
the fifth inning, but Toledo 
opened the inning with a pair 
of singles by Marler and 
Nelson. Both runners then 
advanced on a fly out to center 
field by Muraton before Schaaf 
was walked by IPFW's Mindy 
Mason to load the bases.

Hey, was that a foul? 

Huh? Not sure. I didn't see it very well. 

Why not call it one anyway? 

Sure, sounds like fun. 

How fabulous are the referees these days? 
Of all the "bad boys" in sports, it's amazing 
til il olriaals make themselves more relied than 
anyone Above and beyond Ron "My Middle 
Name Is Flagrant" Artest and Mike Piazza 
whining because the ball never hiLs his bat and 
only him. Ihe officials are the most hated peo- 
ple in stadiums and arenas everyday. 

Covering up a superb week oi playoff 
hi k- key and basketball has been a hoard of 
krnhle calls And they were all crucial calls — 
all game altering in some way. 

Thursday, referees nationwide must 
have convened in an Internet chat room and 
discussed how to blatantly screw up editing 
and interesting games. 

Luckily for the NHL, most of these poor 
zebra calls took place in the NBA. But 
Wednesday's five-overtime thriller between 
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks and the Dallas 
Stars was not short of its piss- poor calls. 

What was the worst part of that was 
that the bad calls came in arguably the best 
hockey game I have ever witnessed. The 
Avalanche/ Panthers multiple-overtime 
game to wrap up the 1997 finals was close 
Other classics have included some bloody 
and battering Avalanche/Red Wings battles, 
bill live merlimi- plaved so hard 1 Do these 



Like many of you out there, or unlike 

vou, lamdcriiiilek cheering tor the underdog 
Ducks. While I'm not a huge NHL fan, or 
Ducks fan fur that matter, the 'Mighty 
Ducks" movie trilogy is a personal favorite 

And a meeling with Dallas, what are 
the odds? (For you non-Ducks movie fans, 
shame on you — Mike Modano gave the 
movie Ducks some words of encouragement 
before a title game while he was still a 
Minnesota North Star.) 

However, those broom-happy real 
Ducks looked like they were going lo get 
cheated out of a win in'lhat tpi, Hie luurlh 
longest game in historv was almosl deall a 
sour hand on an iffy call. Bui all is well thai 



messed up. 

But while refs were blowing close 
games on the ice, olher zebras were enlicing 
unlikely comeback? on the hardwood After 
Milwaukee's loss to New [tr-ey. Bucks coach 
George Karl went on and on about how the 
referees burned the Bucks at the end of a 
game because Kenvon Martin ''wrestled" 
Anthony Mason on the free throw line. 

Well George, did you notice all of the 
olher bad calls thai allowed your Bucks to 
sneak back from 12 down 1 Wipe, they never 
do. But, it's hard to blame old George when 
the officials set a negative precedent. 

Speaking of negative otticiating. anyone 
catch the Lakers/ Timberwolves Game 1 thai 
same night? Now, I'm not one to talk 
con-piracy theory, but can vou say rigged'' 
This one has 'LeBron |ames Hummer 
Incident" written all over it. Where are the 
OMSAA officials lo cover up this one? Oh, 
David Stem's just going to handle it? Okay. 

Let's all be realistic here — the 
Timberwo Ives had the game in the bag at Ihe 
end of the fourth quarter and Ihe officials 
were horrible. 



Remember that foul on Wally 
Szczerbiak on a three-point attempt by Kobe 



iryai 



citb ar. 



md t&lt; 



letl 11 



regulation? Yeah, Wally was about as close tc 
Kobe on that play as he is to me right now. 
Maybe they got mixed up, but can someone 
explain to the NBA officials that contact 
means foul, no eonl.tel mean no foul. Really, 
it's not all thai hard now, is it? 

Following that atrocity, Kobe was 
"fouled" by center Rasho Nesterovic, who 
was standing still with his hand straight in 
Ihe air Wail, is that a foul? Not according to 
what I learned from ex-North Side coach 
Glenn I lealon when I was about 12-years- 
old. These officials are in their thirties and 
older Don't you fhink they could get it right? 

In overtime, il go! worse when Robert 
Horn flopped onto the floor after being 
touched by three lingers of Kevin Garnett 
causing Ihe T -Wolves captain lo pick up his 
sixth foul. 

Did anyone sec that? Horry must have 
been going lo teammate Rick Fox's acting 
school again (For those of you who have 
never seen Fox's acting in any number of 
sport- movies including "He Got Game," 
"Blue Chips," and "Eddie." consider your- 
selves lucky.) 

Once again, however, the T-Wolves 
avoided the mix-up and won Ihe game. But 
will they win the series? Probably not 
because David Stem couldn't have his pet 
Lakers not win the title, could he? I mean, 
they are already pulling out the bad calls lo 
thwart the Kings from making a run (i.e. 
Iheir game Versus Ihe |a/z on Saturday). 

So from fouls lo freeloaders. LeBron 
lames made il official Friday ili.it he will be 
entering the NBA Draft this June, 

Surprise, surprise. That came as a shock, 
didn't it? Plus, I like the nice 
www.lebiorrjaiTies.com backdrop for the 
high school press conference. Real classy for
