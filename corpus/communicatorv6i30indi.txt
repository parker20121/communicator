A 'concerned' generation? 

Last Saturday's rock festival raises some serious questions about the attitudes 
of an upcoming generation of Fort Wayne residents. 

There is danger in generalization, but it's fair to say that the 10 to IS thousand 
young people who attended the concert are a good cross-section of youth In a city of

It is Ironical that some younger members of u generation (hat banded together 
to protest the waste nf lives in Vietnam, thoughtless environmental pollution, and a 
government they felt repressive, couldn't muster enough civility to place their 
garbage in provided receptacles. The Irony ol the situation is furthur compounded 
by the fact that most who attended were guests of the student body. They were 
being treated to an afternoon of entertainment with IPFW bearing most of the 
financial burden of the activity. It is nothing lesB than an Insult to the university 
and its students that the Student Union and surrounding grounds were turned Into
