Dean discusses 
health care issues 

Major focus on 
health care reform 



By Jo Ann Steinforth 
News Editor 

James E. Jones, dean of ihc 
school of health sciences and 
director of dental education, was 
recently appointed as Ihc new 
director to Ihe school of health 
sciences. 

Jones received his B.S. from the 
University of Kentucky in 1973 
and an M.S. in 1977, both in 
zoology. 

He has been with IPFW since the 
fall of 1993 and goals for his 
department will be greatly impact- 
ed by health care reform. 

What arc his immediate goals for 
his dcp:irlincni7 

"Our stralcgic plan will be look- 
ing at various avenues but a lot of 
our focus will depend on the out- 
come of President Clinton's 
health care proposal," said Jones. 

"Nursing will be impacted quile 
a bit as decentralized health care 
will be taken out of the hospitals 
and pul into regional clinics. 
Nursing will become more in 
demand," said Jones. 

His entrance into (his field 
stemmed from his interest in ihc 
heaJUi care profession in general. 

His first full-time leaching posi- 
tion, as assistant professor of pedi- 
atric dentistry in 1983, was at the 
Indiana University School of

Dentistry. 

Later the same year, he received 
the master of science in dentistry 
from The Indiana University 
School of Dentistry in 1983. 

He has completed a United 
Cerebral Palsy Clinical Dental 
Fellowship (1983-84). as well as a 
Denial Faculty Fellowship spon- 
sored by the American Fund for 
Denial Health (1986-87). Jones 
admits he prefers teaching to pri- 
vaie practice. In spite of his busy 
schedule, he still finds lime to 
leach one day a month ai Riley 
Children's Hospital in 



Indianapolis. Most of the work he 
has done in this field is in cleft lip 
and palate. 

On die IPFW campus, he teaches 
Denial Hygiene H302 on a part- 
tune basis and is Ihe administrator 
for ihc dental hygiene clinic. The 
denial clinic is available to all stu- 
dents and faculty on campus, and 
is open five days a week. 

Jones has published over 70 arti- 
cles and research abstracts in den- 
ial, medical and education litera- 
ture. He has obtained over 
$850,000 in educational, service, 
training and research grants. 



African-American professor 
shares experiences and insight 



"Knox proclaimed that young African-Americans must come to love 
themselves and appreciate their African-American heritage." 



by Ramona Mcgown 
Editor in chief 

"In my opinion we should 
celebrate black history 24 hours 
a day, seven days a week, and 
three hundred and sixty five 
days a year. Without Ihe hislory 
of the African-Americans, Ihe 
hislory of America is 
nonexistent," said Rheba Knox, 
assistant professor of political 
science. 

Professor Rheba Knox began 
teaching part-time a! IPFW in 
January of '91. After aciing as 
visiting assistant professor, 
Knox then decided to join (he 
political science depariment on 
a full time basis. 

"I enjoy helping students to 
utilize their abilities to think, 
question, and challenge 
information delivered by their 
professors as well as the 
media," said Knox. 

While attending Howard 
University, professor Knox 
acquired a B.A. in political 
science and psychology, M.Ed. 
in psychological counseling, 
and later wenl on to complete a 
law degree. 

Prior to obtaining her law 
degree, Knox worked at Howard 
University as a psychological 
therapist.

Universily, I was surprised 
when I was exposed to many 
Africans who not only were 
scholars but also spoke several 
different languages along with 
[heir native tongue," said Knox. 
Knox expressed her concern 
that many African-Americans 
are misrepresented by the media 
and (oo often African- 
Americans buy into the 
erroneous way the media 



chooses to depicl the black 
community. 

Knox feels as though African- 
Americans have failed to 
recognize their economic power 

During ihc boycotts of ihe bus 
syslem in the sixties, African- 
Americans really were able lo 
exhibit ihe great amount of 
economic power thai Ihey 
possessed. 

"We as African-Americans put 
a great deal of money into 
businesses but we do nol invest 
into our own," said Knox. 

Knox proclaimed that young 
African-Americans must come 
to love themselves and 
appreciate their African- 
American heritage. 

In holding several occupations 
through her career, Knox has 
worked as an intern for the U.S. 
attorney in Washington D.C., 
served as an psychological 
counselor, and acted as Ihe city 
attorney for Ihe Helmke 
administration. 

"I feel thai I can hold my own 
in any and every situation that I 
may encounter," said Knox. 

Throughoui all of Knox's life 
experiences her ultimate goal is 
to utilize as much of her 
intelligence as possible. 

"My personal goal is lo use as 
much of my brain as I can," said 
Knox.

STAFF EDITORIAL 

The future is 
up to you 

Unfortunately most young adults choose not to vote or 
lake par! in their local, state, and national governments pol- 
icy making processes. As of 1993 there are approximately 
28,944 young adults residing in Allen County and only 
12,531 young people arc even registered to vole. 

Most students and young adults are incredibly quick to 
complain about those who run our government, yet if those 
persons are not even registered and cannot find the time to 
volefwhich lakes about five minutes) then they have no 
right to complain. By choosing nol to vole we, as young 
people, we are giving our consent lo those decisions being 
made hy both our local and stale governments. 

If one asked most young adults in which district they 
reside and who their local and slate representatives are, 
sadly most individuals could nol answer. 

Soon il will be up lo our generation to make ihc same 
decisions thai our representatives both locally and national- 
ly are currently taking part in. Will our generation possess 
the skills to run the country? 

How can we as young Americans complain and intelli- 
gently discuss issues that deal with unemployment, health- 
care, the reform of our welfare system, and our education 
syslem(which is in a state of crisis)? 

When are we going to constructively deal with the fact 
thai so many young adults arc very apathetic towards issues 
that ultimately will affeel them in the fulure? 

Have we chosen lo have a selective memory and forget 
the fact that people losi their lives in order to acquire the 
right to vote? 

It is lime lo take action and become active not only in 
your slate and local governments, but also your student 
government al IPFW. 

Those students wishing to become registered voters can 
go to CM 209 until March 16. Students wishing to take part 
in student government can attend student government 
meetings held every Monday at noon on the second floor of 
Walb. 

We need lo make our representatives, whose salaries we 
are paying for, aware of what are needs are. The representa- 
tives of our state need lo be held accountable for their 
actions, if we do not make sure they are representing our 
interests, who will?

Letters to the editor 

Student expresses unfair characterization 



Tolhe editor: 

Sometimes you don't appreciate 
what you have until someone 
comes along and tells you. Imagine 
my delight to find that I belong 10 
the three "privileged groups in the 
Uniied States of America: whiles, 
heterosexual, and males." Added to 
the fact that I'm an Anglo-Saxon 
Protestant, and I'm leading the veri- 
table Life of Riley. 

I owe il all to an editorial that 
appeared in the February 3 edition 
of The Communicator. A fustian, 
incoherent thing, its 13 column 
inches ran the gamut from Jesus 
being a "man of color" (deduced 



from the fact that Christ is 
described as "despised" and 'reject- 
ed'' in the Scriptures; something 
which apparently never happens to 
while people) to Anita Hill. "No 
one can possibly deny the positive 
influence she has had on our soci- 
ety." You see, it doesn't matter if 
she lied or noL because now we're 
educated as to what sexual harass- 
ment is. The hapless writer should 
understand that Hill merely make it 
popular to claim harassment, which 
is not the same thing. 

Somewhere in between (I told 
you it was incoherent) we're told 
that "sexual orientation should not 
be considered in determining what 



type of person is fit to parent a 
child." This is a distressingly broad 
Statement. Pedophiles have a "sexu- 
al orientation" too. Think they'd be 
good candidates for adoptive par- 
ents? Still more disturbing is the 
chain of reasoning that the editorial 
writer sets in motion: "Most gay 
men and lesbians are bom from het- 
erosexual families. Now if a man 
and a woman cannot prevent a child 
from being homosexual, how can 
two women or two men stop a child 
from being heterosexual or homo- 
sexual? Well, let's sec. Why limit 
the argument to sex? Why not say 
that since two drug-free parents 
cannot prevent their child from 



becoming a drug abuser, can two 
drug users prevent a child from 
being addicted or clean? In effect, 
the writer is arguing and parents 
have absolutely no effect on the 
outcome ofachild. 

My objection to same-sex adop- 
tions is less concerned with the 
replication of homosexuals (as real 
as that possibility is) than it is with. 
producing unfortunates who write 
silly editorials for their school 
paper. Anybody that can claim with 
a straight face that homosexuality is 
not "politically correct" needs to 
get out of the house more often.

A voice from generation X 

Valentine's Day ^|f*|*|*|* 



by Edward GranzeUa Jr 
Staff Columnist 

You all know the story. 
Valentine's Day is Ihe day that 
friends, lovers, and hopeful lovers 
send affectionate gifts and mes- 
sages to each other. There is some 
debate as to when the tradition 
started. Some say it started in the 
late 16th century. On February 
14th. it was told, birds begin to 
choose their mates. Yeah, right! I 
suspect that might be a processed 
version in order to make the day 
more digestible. 

Originally it was called "Men's 
Forgive me for my Insensitivity 
Day." Back in the days prior to 
mainstream feminism, when men 



were actually calling the shots, 
women were truly relegated to Ihc 
kitchen and raising of die children. 
I bet back then men thought "hey, 
this is great." Then after that they 
thought "I wonder what's for sup- 
per." After a couple of tuna 
casseroles, men realized some of 
the control women have in (heir 
lives. Naturally, it had to happen. 
He would go out and buy flowers 
and say those magic words, "Please 
cook steak more often." Just kid- 
ding - maybe. 

It wasn't loo many years ago that 
Valentine's Day was my favorite 
day - belter than Christmas or my 
birthday. I was moronically in love, 
of course. I don't say madly, pas- 
sionately, or hopelessly in love, not 



Student unhappy with columnist 



To the editor: 

Irrational fear may, in addition to 
manifesting as hatred result in con- 
fused thinking such as that dis- 
played in a recent attempt at parody 
by Communicator staff columnist 
Edward GranzeUa Jr. 

Drawing a comparison between 
the desegregation of black U.S. 
military personnel, and contempo- 
rary efforts to end the Pentagon's 
discriminatory policies against 
homosexuals, Granzclla suggested 
gay soldiers be segregated in units 
with names like "Fighting Queens" 
or "Pink Brigade." He then sug- 
gested such units be used as front- 
line cannon-fodder, "in the hopes 
that a major portion of the enemy's 
munitions might be wasted prior to 
sending in the real troops." 

Since GranzeUa apparently recog- 
nized a parallel between the status 
of black soldiers 40 years ago, and 
that of gay soldiers now. it is fair to 
ask whether or not bis bigotry 
applies toward both groups of peo- 
ple; if ii does, why doesn't 
GranzeUa articulated the full range 
of his bigotry? 

If GranzeUa believes that gay sol- 
diers should be segregated, stereo- 
typed, and quickly destroyed, does 
be likewise feel thai black soldiers 
should be separated from whites. 



racially stereotyped, and pushed to 
the fore of battle as part of a selec- 
tive liquidation scheme? 
If that is not the case, then by what 
method does GranzeUa determine 
which groups of people he would 
like to have slaughtered? 

Gran2clla's assumptions about 
militarism reveal a confusion com- 
parable to the conflicting impres- 
sions of homosexuals his column 
lumped together. He referenced 
"principle" and "duty to country" 
as trite reasons for gays to enlisL 
and suggested their status is an 
"essay out for an opportunity to be 
senselessly killed in some exotic 
locale"; but then he referred to 
"straight boys" who "get killed to 
preserve the way of life of the peo- 
ple (including gays) back home" 
and labeled those who went to 
Canada to avoid the draft in die 
1950s as cowards. 

Can Gran2ella explain how he 
arrived upon this array of contra- 
dictory claims? 

And who is GranzeUa to judge 
those who refused to participate in 
the U.S. invasion of Indochina? As 
an apparently self-destructed 
"Voice from Generation X" has 
GranzeUa ever received a draft 
notice? 

Jeff Brunson 



because they don't apply, they do. I 
just think my dramatic reduction of 
cognitive functioning was the most 
significant side effect of my deep 
affection. On Valentine's Day, I 
would go all out, flowers, choco- 
lates, gifts, and , of course, a long 
letter proclaiming my devotion and 
my passion for her. That day by 
itself could drain my finances and 
blind mc so greatly that for months 
afterwards I could be happy at 
home alone, unable to afford a 
decent night ouL with only images 
of her on die TV and in my bead, 
thinking of what may be. Little did 
I realize at the end that she was 
unwilling lo hurt me by saying that 
I was not for her. For a year and a 
half, my ambition, sense of humor, 
and positive disposition were eaten 
away by a cold shoulder. 

A few years later. 1 consciously 
said Valentine's Day is just a day 
like any other. Hell, 1 went out to 
get a haircut, coupon in hand, of 
course. Let me give you guys a 
hint, never gel your hair cut on 



Valentine's Day. Even if those his- 
toric gangland murders in Chicago 
never occurred, I still think the 
notion of a Valentine's Day mas- 
sacre would have been dubbed. 
From their constant yammering, the 
girls at the salon were more inter- 
ested in what their boyfriends were 
going to do for them instead of the 
apparent danger my ears were in 
from the scissors they yielded with 
significanUy less skill than a ninja 
master. I knew that I was in trouble 
at the end of the haircut when my 
head had a noticeable lack of sym- 
metry to it, but I was grateful dial 
no blood was lost in the experience. 
Valentine's Day is a special day 
which must be respected. It honors 
the power of love, one of the most 
potent of all powers. Love's fickle 
fancy can float you in the clouds or 
crush you like a termite. Embracing 
love invites both ecstasy and disas- 
ter into your life. Take it from this 
squished bug. love is a game best 
played in virtual reality.

Former freshman knows-it-all 



When I returned to school, I 
made a few assumptions about 
pursuit of education: 

(1) I would have io attend classes. 

(2) I would have to read the text- 
books. 

(3) I would have to accept the 
standards, whether harsh or seem- 
ingly weak, of each of my instruc- 
tors, if I were truly inierested in 
that class or in doing well in that 
class. 

I don't see what the problem for 
you is An instructor you perceive 
as weak and Uberal in grading can 
only be to your advantage. If you 
are on die line between a B and 
an A, and a curve helps you, do 
you quibble about this? You 
worked hard for an 88%, and it 
feels like a 90% to you, doesn't 
it? As for those who think reading 
their textbook is a joke and dial 



attending class is only for those 
with nothing better io do, a slight 
curve does NOT help them. I 
don' t believe anyone on this cam- 
pus curves enough to give a D 
student an A, as you imply. 

I assume from your opinion col- 
umn 'fi.ii you are a freshman. It 
won't take long for you to recog- 
nize that some of these weak pro- 
fessors really taught you much 
more than you realized. You sure- 
ly know already that no professor 
knows everything, and it won't 
take you long to leam that he 
doesn't think be knows every- 
thing either. (And why would a 
psych professor know about a 
medical anomaly?) But certainly 
even the lamest professor has 
something to offer YOU. He's not 
trying lo ptetC* you, he's trying to 
figure out how to reach you.

Aunt Louise gives tips on how to make this year's holiday special 



Dear Aunl 
Louise, 

I really don'i 
have a problem. 
I just need 10 
seek some guid- 
ance from you. 
Recently, I jusl 
met ihis gor- 
geous guy in a 
bar. Well, aciu- 
ally. I didn't 
just meet him. I've known him for 
some lime. It's just lhai we ended 
up seeing each other out on Ibe 
town. 
Anyway, we nil it off prciiy well. 




I think he likes me. I know I like 
him The guidance I need is to 
know if I should ask him to do 
something on Valentine's Day or 
not. 
Well, whaidoldo? 

Sincerely, 
Tell Me What Should I Do 

Dear Tell Me What Should I Do, 

Honey, Valentine's Day is jusi 
around the corner Now, if you 
think he won't have a problem with 
you two doing something, I would 
go for it. You're only young once, 
tumip-top, Anyway, it's the 90s. 
Well, since Valentine's Day is 



near I came up with some little 
things ya'll can do to make the love 
day a little bit more special. 

For outdoor folks, you have sev- 
eral options. First of 
all. it's just a bit too 
chilly out to have a 
picnic and your 
blanket would get 
wet from all of the 
snow. So, what ya'll 
could do is go 
downtown and take 
a nice romantic car- 
riage ride. I think 
they still have them 
during this lime. 




If they don'i offer those carriage 
rides, the ne*t best thing is to rent a 
limo and ride around town or out in 
(he country with a little champagne 
lo keep you two 
warm, You know 
ibe country is very 
romantic. 

Now something 
my dear ol' Dorcus 
and I did last year 
was have a little ol' 
picnic inside with a 
little fire in the fire- 
place. I cooked a 
mess of vittles. We 
just ale and ate. The 



food was delicious. 

1 was talking to my cousin 
Beatrice. She told me that she and 
her husband. Louis, one time spent 
Valentine's Day in a hot tub with 
bubbles and champagne. Who 
child. I tell you. Dorcus and ! had a 
really nice time when we did that 
last year on our anniversary. 

For some of the more adventurous 
folks, why not place little notes all 
over the place and lead your beau 
on a little adventure with you being 
the treasure. 

A message for all of my good 
looking gals, don't be afraid to send 
all of your men flowers like roses. 



Men m.iv . K i nice they don't appre- 
ciate thai stuff but ihcy do. 

1 cm ,lIi ol you .inn ehaii rotncos, I 
suggest sou bum up your credit cm 
.it Victoria's Secret and buy your 
woman something special You 
know something (ha( you both will 
remember and thai will set die night 
on fire. 

Remember a diamond i&gt; ,i girl's 
best friend. 

Or why not just cuddle up togeth- 
er a nice romantic film like 
Casablanca' Isn't that the best' 

Your loving Aunt Louise 



IPFW students help 
with time capsule project 



by Carrie Combs 
Staff Writer 

IPFW's communication depart- 
ment will lake part in Fort Wayne's 
bicentennial celebration by produc- 
ing a thirty-minute video which 
will profile Fort Wayne in 1994. 

Den Eisbart. a member of the 
Bicentennial lime capsule commit- 
tee, diought of die idea. 

Terry Doran, a local film produc- 
er, is in charge of the overall pro- 
duction of this video. 

The video, along will] documents 
and other historical items, will be 
put into a lime capsule to be opened 
on Ociobcr 22. 2004, exactly one 
hundred years aflcr the time cap- 
sule is buried. 

The video will contain a brief his- 
tory of Fort Wayne. Throughout 
the video Fort Wayne in 1994 will 
be compared to the Fort Wayne of 
1949. 

In 1949, Look magazine stated 
that Fori Wayne was tie happiest 
city in America, a Utopia. Doran 
and Ihc students working on the 



video will try to see if people still 
feel this way about Fort Wayne 
today. 

The students working on Ihc 
video arc a part of the communica- 
tion department and will receive 
class credit for their involvement. 
Channel 6 is lending its facilities to 
Doran and the students for work on 
the video. 

Before the lime capsule is buried, 
the video will be shown to the pub- 
lic. A taped discussion will follow 
the viewing of the video. This live 
discussion will also be included 
wilh the contents in the time cap- 
sule. 

"The video will be honesi, not 
glamorizing any particular group. 
We'll cover such topics as housing, 
crime, social services, and AIDS. 
We also hope to follow a few fami- 
lies and show daily life in Fori 
Wayne," said Doran. 

CunenUy, ihc video committee is 
trying to publicize the production in 
hopes lo receive ideas, pictures, 
stories, or anything thai may be of 
interest.

Features Editor 

[| you're a college sludent and 
don't have any summer plans, have 
you ever considered participating 
in the Walt Disney World Fall 
College Program? 

Once again, representatives from 
the Walt Disney World College 
Program will visit tPFW on March 
16, 1994. at 9 a.m. 

John B. Knight, assistant profes- 
sor of consumer and family sci- 
ences, has much enthusiasm for the 
program. 

"All majors arc invited to come 
out and inierview for Ihe posi- 
tions," Knight commented. "But 
people will need (o be there at 9 
sharp. Anyone showing up after 
nine will not be interviewed." 

Knight has participated in the 
program for the past fifteen years. 
He originally brougbi Ihc program 
to IPFW a year and a half ago. 

The Walt Disney World Fall 
College Program is designed to 
give students insight into the day to

You didn't hear it 
from me, but... 



by F. Lane Douse 
Features Editor 

You didn'l hear ii from me, but 
there a loi of people on this cam- 
pus who really need to make an 
alliiude change. 

I will noi even sLirt on a certain 
professor on campus that read a 
certain controversial article that 
raised hell on campus several 
years ago like in 1991, Now. 1 
Ihink Jim Walker was editor in 
chief. According to the professor 
it was well-written and just satire. 
Someone forgo! bad taste. 

I just want lo know how many 
students were truthfully offended 
by this supposed parody. 

I guess, a congratulations goes 
out to Jerry Richardson who is 
now our sludent body president. 
Of course, you were the nexl in 
line and not elected into ihc 
office. The same thing happened 
lo Mark King who is now our 
Vicc-Ptesidcni of Legislation. So. 
I think it's important thai all you 
students start attending the meet- 
ings lo find oui whal your new 
studenl leadership is doing. 

Now some people would con- 
sider some of ihc statcmenls I 
make as irying to stir up trouble. 
I'm really not about causing any 



hard limes lor anyone. I jusl like 
students to participate in their stu- 
denl government. 

I know everyone will be walch- 
ing you iwo. And so will I. 

Since I'm talking about people's 
actions, 1 was informed thai a cer- 
tain director on campus stormed 
into a certain newspaper office 
with a big time attitude about a 
certain editorial. 

The only thing I have lo say is 
that (hose actions are not profes- 
sional and becoming of a director 
or coach. But, 1 ain't one to talk 
about nobody! 

Well, I ain't. 

Now, I have to talk about ihc 
siudents who wani to critique The 
Communicaiot before il goes lo 
prim. Hmmmm, isn't thai some- 
thing like prior review? 

I know my journalism rights 
and we don't have lo show you 
nothing. So, if you journalism stu- 
dents have a problem with content 
and copy-editing of the paper, I 
strongly suggest, encourage, and 
demand lhai you get involved! 
Why don't you come and work 
wilh us? Boy. is thai an original 
idea. 

Quitchurbitchin'! 
Kiss. Kiss.

Tanisha- 



by Tanisha Washington 
Sports Editor 

The lights come up on the play- 
ing field. The athletes' palms 
sweat as they anxiously await [he 
opportunity to demonstrate their 
skill; but wail. There is one task 
they must perform before they arc 
allowed to play. They must pledge 
allegiance to the United States of 
America. 

This issue of sportsmanship 
involving "political 

correctness/politics" has been 
around for years. During a 1960s 
Olympic medalist ceremony, three 
black men raised closed fists sym- 
bolizing the popular 60's black 
power movement while being rec- 
ognized for track and field. The 
men were stripped of their medals 
and labeled "unsponsman-likc." 



But we have advanced... right 1 
It's the '90s. almost the 2lst centu- 
ry, we're more liberal now... right? 

Wrong. 

Earlier this year, a young man 
was dismissed from a local high 
school basketball team because he 
refused to salute the flag and to 
sing the national anthem. 

The last time this reporter 
checked, it was not only legal to 
refuse participation in such events, 
it was also legal to bum the flag 
itself. Is saluting the flag a prereq- 
uisite for playing practically any 
sport in America? Outside the idea 
of brotherly love hence love of 
country, there really is no basis for 
such a requirement and that alone 
is slim at best, 

This idea of political correctness 
even managed to slip into one of if 
not America's most favorite sport- 
ing event, the Super Bowl. 

This year some African- 
American journalists and others 
protested thai the Super Bowl 
should not be played in Georgia as 
long as tie Georgia state flag con- 
tained the Confederate symbol. 
Did these people have a legitimate 
protest? Was the sports arena the 
proper place to voice their con- 
cerns? 

I say yes to bolh. 

The bottom line my friends is 
that the First Amendment to the 



Uniied States Constitution guaran- 
tees each and every citizen ihe 
right lo freedom of speech, peace- 
ful prolcsi and the rest (I'm sure 
these rights have been pounded 
into your heads in more than one 
course so 1 won't bore you) 
regardless of Ihe occupation, race, 
or religion of that citizen. 

Agreeing to play a sport should 
not mean signing your name to an 
invisible contract that stresses 
patriotism and embraces practices 
or doctrines that are not in line 
with individual beliefs. The rules 
and regulations governing athletics 
should reflect the rules and regula- 
tions governing this country. 
However, athletes and those who 
contribute (fans, media, coaches, 
owners etc.) do have the right lo 
voice political complaints in the 
sports arena if their complaints 
involve sports. 

The bottom line is that sports 
must find a balance in dealing with 
political issues. Political issues 
should not overtake the purposes 
of athletics (having fun. compet- 
ing, relating to others etc.) howev- 
er, political issues must be 
addressed. To borrow another idea 
from the Constitution, perhaps ath- 
letic teams should consider a "due 
process" or definidve and fair way 
of handling these issues.
