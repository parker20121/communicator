Nader criticizes 4tli 
district Congressman 
Marl&lt; Souder 




Consumer advocate Ralph Nader comments c 
Souder's record at Monday's press conference 



byNolReckley 
bxlilor 

On Monday. Sept. 18, consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader seriously criticized the corporate-sponsored 
American govemmeni at a speech to nearly 600 people 
in Walb Union, 

Nader had especially harsh words for 
4lh district congressmen Mark Souder (R) 
and his voting record. Very little of a 
Congressmen's record is familiar to his 
consliluenLs cxcepi Ihe reconl the represen- 
laiive wishes the public lo hear, aceoiding 
10 Nader, 

"Rep. Souder has put corporate spe- 
cial interests above public health and the 
environment, " Nader said Nader said 
every lime a corporate interest is al slake 
Souder and ihe majoriiy of Congress will 
usually vote with ihe corporate inlercsl 
Nader also said Souder has voted for legis- 
lation which would weaken law enforce- 
ment on environmental issues. 

Nader also pointed to Souder's 
refusal to sign a bill lo rescind Ihe midnight 
pay raises passed by the previous session 
of Congress as a sign of his departure from 
conservative principles. "It was my under- 
standing thai the new members of 
Congrt'ss, especially the Republicans, were 
coming to Washington to end 'business as 
usual.' atHJ instead they are preserving their 
high pay and Congrc,ssional pensions." said 
Nadcr. 

"Rep, Souder's voles on legislation to 
roll back health and safety protections for 
workers, attack the free speech rights of 
public interest organizations and restrict 
the govemmeni's ability lo punish corpo- 
rate cnminals suggests that the people of 
Indiana should take a close look at the 
record and consider whether Mr. Souder is 



providing the kind of leadership ihcir state needs," 

Souder issued a siaicmeni on Sept. 18 which 
responded to Nader's criticism 

He said. '"Ralph Nader continues lo use the lactic^, 
false accusaUons, and exaggeraiions thai have madk 
him irrelevant to most public dcbaics. Ralph Nader will 
not be happy until every factory is shut down and ever% 
farm is shuttered. For example, he suppons Icgislatinn 
that would be devastating to Fon Wayne's pickup plain 
I'm being criticized by Ihe oil companies for my vote^ 
and now by Ralph Nader. 1 mu''! be doing someihiii)' 
right ... despicable, false ■•care tactics like Nader use 
are beyond the boundaries of public debaie." 

George Gounans, IPSGA senator, said he belicvt- 
Nader's message needs lo be heard at IPFW and Ihe rcsi 
of the country. "If he wasn't worth hearing wc wouldn't 
have had ihe numbers wc had. " said Gounaris. 

Nader also critici/cd the television industry [&lt;&gt;i 
appealing lo the lowest common denominator of th&lt;. 
American public, 'The degradation of lasle caimot K 
simply Jusiified by saying "We're giving them wh;ii 
they want,'" said Nader. 

Nader addressed several issues concerning the publn 
and their rights. Nader focused upon the rights many 
Americans do not even realize they arc granted. 

Nader asked the audience to look at corporations in .&lt; 
different way than Ihey have in the past, "Cconomi' 
power. ... in the form of a corporate insliiution. kno\'' 
few boundaries unless il is checkmated," said Nader. 
Corporations have consislendy failed lo learn from iIk 
past, according to Nader. "Almost every single refonn 
Ihey [corporations) opposed, they are now using in ilieii 
adveriiscmenLs or beneruing from," Nader said. He list 
ed several ex-imples of Ihis fact; the Fmid and Druj- 
Administration. USDA Meal InspecUon, and auloimj 
bile air bags and anti-lock brakes. 

He further indicated loo many social insliluiions aii: 
becoming commerciali/ed. The health care business h;L^ 
put billing the paiieni before caring for the patient, 
according lo Nader

Blake said students attend colleges for 
the same basic reasons, however the post 
collegiate goals on average were differ- 
ent. Blake also suggested ways to meci 
the challenge of diversity 
m the classroom. 

Following the address, 
the audience split into 
focus groups in order to 
dLscuss Ihe issues raised by 
Blake. 

"It is clear from this 
workshop that there is a 
commitmenl to being open 
lo diversity," said Director 
of Communications John 
Piirrish-Sprowl 

l-riday morning, nine 
studenis served on a stu- 
dent panel moderated by 
Blake The audience was 
encouraged to ask ques- 
tions of Ihe panel. 

"I was sOrry ihere 
were not more faculty 
members there," said 
Modem Foreign Language 
chair Jeanclie Clausen. 
However, Clausen said she 
was glad lo see those who 
were in attendance. 

Andre Fux. student and 
president of Hipanos 
Unidos. said the panel dis- 



cussion did not offer 
enough solutions, but he 
believes the wrap-up ses- 
sion which followed Ihe 
panel discussion was more 
beneficial. Fux said he 
wishes the time allotted 
could have been longer 

Despite the many posi- 
tive things he received 
from Ihe Iwo-day session. 
Fun said he believes not 
much will change on cam- 
pus, "The school needs lo 
be involved in diversity," 
Fax said, "You have to do 
more than keep an image " 

Pamsh-S prowl said Ihe 
recoirunendalions are perti- 
nenl and should be fol- 
lowed within the restraints 
of the budget, 

"h's all Ihe more impor- 
lani to keep this issue in 
the forefront." said 
Clausen, 

Fux said he was con-

College is supposed lo provide

leam in a conscious manner. Thai 
is one lype of learning Ihai takes

in oiher words the learning thai 
lakes place from whai we are 
enposcd ro wiihin the college envi- 
rimmenl. If in thai environmem we 
are cuposcd lo an adminisiralion 
ihai lacks diversity and does noth- 
ing lo creaic it or balance il, then 
sub-consciously we leam that its 
okay not lo have diversity amongst 
ourselves In other words, to CTcale 
diversity, we need lo be exposed lo 
diversity, and for that to happen 
here on ihis campus, divcrsily 
needs lo start from die lop levels of 
the adminisiralion and work ils 
way down into Ihe classroom 
Remember we leam from what wc

cxpecl people lo have diversity if 
lliey arc not exposed to ii. 



Paul Tapper, siuilent panelist 

I saw many things at the diveni- 
ly panel discussion: hope, sincerity, 
anger, and promise It was a great 
thing to fmally be heard I say thai 
knowing nnany of you are laughing 
because 1 talk about gay things on a 
weekly basis, but I rarely gei to 
answer specific questions coming 
from real people. I want to be 
asked Uiuse things you don't know 
I want to be iniclligcntly chal- 
lenged on my answers 1 wani lo 
get these things oui in the open 
This forum was a way of doing 
that. Hopefully, one day one day, 
you will feel strongly enough to 
come listen

These are my feelings concern- 
ing the Friday Student Panel: 
I feel that studenLs are looked upon 
as disruptions instead of Ihe pur- 
pose thai administration, faculty,

Although students can oveaeaci 
and be overbearing, Ihere needs lo 
be understanding and compassion-

1 was honored lo be asked lo sit 
on the student panel discussion on 
diversity. The experience was 



exhilarating and very insightful I 
wish more students, faculty, 
administrators, alumni, and com- 
munity members would have been 
present. 

During die discussion I feel the 
panclLsLs were ba.sically requesting 
respect and asking lo be allowed to 
be a pan of the policy making and 
personnel hiring committees I 
believe we were asking to assume 
our chunk of responsibility for cre- 
ating a diverse IPFW. 

I hope over the next few weeks, 
all of Ihc people who attended the 
discussion will begin to evaluate 
their own actions and challenge 
themselves to do their pari. And 
ibosc who where unable to attend 
or simply chose not to attend will 
seek out a person who attended and 
become informed. 

It will take all of us to create an 
aunosphere of diversity. But until 
we achieve equality we musi not 
only keep ourselves educated and 
in check, but also hold other 
administrators, students, and facul- 
ty responsible for their [ian

One in three women is senually 
assaulted by the age of 18. The 
same is irue of one out of five to six 
men, depending on which study is 
presented. 

One way for people who have 
been sexually assaulted to find sup- 
port is to attend the 1995 survivor's 
rights rally entitled "Moving 
Forward." 

The rally is to lake place on 
Sept 23 at the First Presbyterian 
Church located at 300 W. Wayne 
Street, The rallcj begins. at noon 
with a welcome session. At 1 p.m. 
specific wbr'li'snops begin. Ttiere

Sexual assault happens to men 
nearly as much as it happens to 
women. This type of assault has lit- 
tle to do with sex or physical atuac-

person to dominate another.

Tired of throwing 
your weight around' 



By Rebecca Kuenig 
Chief Reporter 

The Iniernaiional Student's 
Organization (ISO) plays an 
extremely important roll in educa- 
tion in today's world, in which 
global interaction is a certainty. 
The ISO allows studenis from any 
country, including the United 
States, to leam more about culture 
and how to deal with one another in 
a social and business selimg. 

The organization is open lo any- 
one, despite nationality. Students, 
professors and administrators are all 
welcome lo panicipaie. Tony Bui 
is Ihe organization's President, He 
is assisted by two Vice-Presidents. 
Phil Marx and Naushad Mositafa 
Treasurer Evlin Vifans and 
Secretary Thoa Huynh. 

With over sixty countries repre- 
sented on campus, ISO is an invalu- 
able tool siudents can use to launch 



their careers after graduation. The 
days of isolation arc over and we 
are now competing nationally for 
our jobs and economy. Given this 
information, it seems likely that 
organizations such as ISO play a 
vital roll on any college campus, 
said Bui. 

"Everything around us is con- 
nected to other countries," said Bui, 

It has been only since 1987 dial 
intemauonal studenis were accept- 
ed into Purdue Since then the 
number enrolled in Indiana has 
greatly increased, A certificate in 
International Affairs is also now 
available at IPFW These relatively 
new opportunities open doors to 
many students, which will effect the 
rest of their lives, 

"The ISO helps Ihe university 
grow and recognize diere are other 
countries and people in the world." 
said Philip Kennel, the advisor for 
ISO. 



Since the spring of 1987, ISO 
has actively been promoting IPFW 
10 inlcmational students. Most of 
this is done through mailings, fliers 
and word of mouth. Often times 
friends, relatives and community 
involvement are the key to increas- 
ing the enrollment of imemational 
students at IPFW "U put Ihe capiiol 
'U' in 'University,'" said Kennel. 

Students join ilie ISO for many 
reasons International studenis join 
ISO for a support group. They leam 
the customs and culture of Amenca, 
Many American students also join 
ISO, It allows them the opportunity 
to make friends, who might later 
benefit ihem in life. The immigrant 
population in America can be better 

IT Yo 



understood if one learns more about 
other cultures It also helps stu- 
dents to leam and share ideas in a 
unique way 

As well as social events, the ISO 
arranges between two and six facul- 
ty lectures a year, and also have a 
library of 10 videotapes for anyone 
interested. The ISO takes infonna- 
tion normally found in a textbook 
and demonstrates it in the flesh. 

The ISO cunently consists of 
125 foreign students and 200 per- 
manent residence of various ori- 
gins. Anyone interested in learning 
more about or joining the organiza- 
tion can call Multicultural services 
at 481-6823 or stop by the office in

Activities fee does 
not reflect student 
interest 



During ihc iwo-day Diversity 
Workshops, many students con- 
cerns wae distus.sctJ One concern 
was the amount of money that the 
athletic depanmcnl receives from 
tbe Student AcUviues fee Students 
are forced to pay these fees 
whether or not they are active in 
any student organization or use the 
athletic facilities. There is no 
choice in the matter. The fees arc 
added on and sludcnis are expected 
10 pay them. 

What is really shocking is that 
out of these moneys, the athletic 
depanmeni receives 60 percent, 
and student organizations (includ- 
ing student government and The 
Communicator) must fight and 
^ply for the rest Elders and men- 
tors tell students to get involved 
widi extra curricular activities But 
unless one chooses athletics, the 
possibilities are limited In other 
words, at a higher education insti- 
tution the body is more imporunt 
than the mind. 

This, ot course, is all old news. 
We could not figure out why noth- 
ing was being done to rectify this .. 
until now At Tuesday's Indiana- 
E^udue Foundation at Fort Wayne 
annual meeting, a breakdown of 
the financial statements was hand- 
ed to the attendees, many of whom 
were representatives of the biggest 
financial contributors to IPFW 
Listed on page five was the annual 
statement tor contributions 



received. Fourth from tbe lop was 
"Athletic Gifts" which amounted to 
nearly S25.000 Tliis means donors 
gave the athletic department this 
money specifically to them. Why 
docs athletics need so much of our 
money? 

An additional S25.00O could 
easily be used by other organiza 
tions to attract guest speakers, 
group trips, fund-raisers, child care, 
etc. Sixty percent of student mone; 
going to something that so Se\ 
dents use is unethical. There was a 
time when athletics provided a 
great service to the academic com- 
munity It brought the community 
together. More students of today, in 
Fort Wayne, IN. at a commuter 
campus are more concerned with 
advancing their futures than going 
to aibletic events This can be done 
by Joining student organizations 
that deal wiUi the specific needs of 
the students and their majors 
Check out the attendance of any 
sporting event Very few of them 
arc studcnLs 

This i.s not meant to devalue the 
importance of those students 
involved in athletic activities or 
those who work for the department 
But it seems to us that those in the 
Gates Center should have to 
depend on collective efTorU lo raise 
money as much as ibe student 
organizations do, of which there 
are nearly 70 different organiza- 
tions.

Pro-censorship goons 
decry campus censorship 



by Jeff Brunson 
Ex -c om m u ni ca led 

While loitering in the CM 

lounge recendy. 1 leafed through a 
copy of "Campus Report," which 
some thoughtful conservative had 
placed on a table for my reading 
enjoyment, "Campus Report" is 
published by Accuracy In 
Academia. AIA is a misnamed off- 
shoot of another misnamed outfit 
called Accuracy In Media. 
Conservative acuvist Reed Irvine is 
the chairman of both organizations. 

Not surprisingly, AIA and AIM 
share the .same thematic redundan- 
cy. In the pages of AIAs Campus 
Repon, liberals and leftists are cast 
as ihroiUing campuses nationwide 
in an iron grip of coercive ortho- 
doxy In the annais of AIM. a 
national media cast as liberal and 
leftist is the targeted bogeyman. 

The October issue of Campus 
Report which I perused largely con- 
sisted of rehashed anii-"Poliiical 
Correctness" hysteria A backpage 
inset explained that AIA "seeks the 
reasscrtion of traditional academic 
ethics in oui universities We con- 
tend that academic freedom is 
threatened by a progressive ideo- 
logical orthodoxy, pervasive in the 
intellectual community, 

which... inhibits speech and research 
which contradicts orthodox views." 

AIA's posturing embrace of 
unhindered speech is more than a 
little ironic when you consider the 
actual record of its chairman, and 
the corporate-financed parent of 
AIA. Accuracy In Media's func- 
tion is to pressure mas,s media out- 
lets into hewing closely to conserv- 
auve political and cultural prion- 
ties. One of AIM's primary func- 
tions since its inception in 1969. 
has been to encourage the censor- 
ship of journalists who report infor- 
mation that inconveniences AIM's 
corporate and ideological allies.

f-ormet New York Times 
reporter Raymond Bonner was one 
of the more noteworthy casualties 
in AIM'S war against truths that it 
doesn't want divulged. Twelve 
years ago, Bonner broke the story 
of a massaae in the Salvadoran vil- 
lage of Mo/ote. A US. -trained 
Salvadoran government battalion 
slaughtered 482 villagers— 280 of 
which were children younger than 
14 years — at a time when the 
Reagan administration was trying 
10 put a friendly spin on its 
Salvadoran client regime. AIM and 
the Reagan administration reacted 
by successfully pressuring 'Times 
publisher Ardiur Ochs Sulzberger 
into pulling Bonner out of El 
Salvador and demoting him Soon 
after, Bonner resigned. 

In a subsequent issue of "AIM 
Report" Irvine gloated. 'Here is 
some good news. You can quit 
wrilmg Mr. Sulzberger at the New 
York Times about Raymond 
Bonner. Bonner is no longer the 
correspondent for the Times in 
Central America " 

Founded in 1969, AIM grew 
rapidly into a formidable opponent 
of honest journalism. By the early 
1980s, AIM was raking in SI ,5 md- 
lion a year, financed primarily by 
large corporations, conservative 
foundations and extremely wealthy 
individuals. 

AIM'S pressure campaigns 
largely reflect the concerns of iLs 
monicd patrons For example, a 
signiricani share of AtM's revenue 
is drawn from oil and chemical 
companies And not surprisingly. 
AIM wages frequent campaigns to 
stamp out environmental reporting 
which takes a critical look at oil 
and chemical companies that subsi- 
dize AIM. 

Aiming AIM's aims at acade- 
mia, AIA's Campus Report pre- 
tends to despise censorship while 
its editor. Reed Irvine, continues to 
launch censorship campaigns 
against journalists who offend 

corporate masters I hope Ibat 
future issues of Campus Report 
await me when I have five minutes 
tokill inCM's lounge. It'sbeadon 
reality rivals that of odier publica- 
tions I have leafed through while 
waiting m line at the supermarket. 

Columnist note: This piece was 
originally submitted to The 
Communicator during the previous 
school year. Under die editorship 
of a strident conservative at the 
time, however. The Communicator 
declined to publish it. 

How ironic. 



Gays want to 
be remembered

on a student panel for diversity

diversity 1 walked away feeling I 
had made a few friends with the 
other members of the panel But 
since only fifty people showed up, 
I would like to restate a few points 
I made at the session. 

When you talk about diversity, 
please do not forget the gay-les- 

bian-bisexual com- 

munily It is an easy 
thing lo do, because 
most don't equate 
sexuality wiUi diver- 
sity But the truth is. 
gays are a minority 
who are discriminat- 
ed against because of 
who they arc and for 
not being within the 
social norm 

You have to 
remember that gays 
are a people of value. 
We, like the African 
Americans. Native 
Americans, Latin 
Americans, and physically chal- 
lenged persons, have a history ot 
quality people who have done great 
things. We are also ignored in die 
history books. Well, they're there, 
just not revealed to be gay during 
the lesson. This is pan of the rea- 
son why gay kids have low self- 
esteems and commit suicide When 
you believe that there are no good 
people like you, you begin io think 
that you will never be a good per- 
son, that you cannot achieve 
great things 

Gay people are smart, funny, 
articulate, civil and talented We 
are a group of people diat refuse lu 
be ignored So when you talk about 



done on gay people. I let him off 
the hook this time, but this argu- 
ment is stariing to wear thin. There 
has been scholarly research done. 
A friend and I plan to get that 
information to Helmke Library for 
our use, 

Plus, I personally have never 
been asked to participate in a 
research study regarding gays. 
Neither have any of my friends. 
Any sociologist can do the 
research. We can be found! With a 
little effori. gays willing lo be stud- 
ied and some results could 
be produced. 

Many people have commented 
on Chancellor Michael Wartell's 
absence Regarding the issue of the 
lack of the chancellor's presence, 1 
have this to say; He ntay have been 
busy with other activities, he is 
cunendy not telling This is not to 
say that he wasn't supportive, he 
did allocate the money for the 
pizza party that kicked off the 
workshops But I truly believe that 
if he reallv felt passionate about the 

issue, he would have 

been there He 
should have sent a 
statement ahead of 
the panel to at least 
wish us well and 
send his regreis for 
not being able to 
attend It would 
have been inspiring 
to have him, but if 
the issue is not that 
important to htm. I 
can understand. He 
already has a 
great job- 
Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs 
Frank Borelli should take some 
heat as well Dunng a round table 
discussion, we were all asked what 
we personally were going to do for 
the cause of diversity His answer 
was the most broad and least com- 
mittal He then felt the need to 
defend the boys' club of Kettler 
Hall, when it is in fact they who 
need to be held the most account- 
able When a restaurant has a ttad 
review, you blame the store man- 
ager I really want to like these 
guys, but they are making 
it difficult. 

1 would also like to say that 1 
was particularly impressed with 



When you believe 
that there are no 
good people like 
you. you begin to 
think that you will 
never be a good 
person, that 
you cannot 

achieve 
great things 



those who participated in the worlc- 
diveniiy, you bad better bring us shops. Everyone seemed to be in 
into the discussion. We together tune with the issues being dis- 



pull this togcihc 
The second pouii I made was in 
3 conversauon I had with Dr. Blake 
after the panel session. He had said 
the reason tie did not refer to gays 
in his writings or his presentation 
was because of tbe lack of research 



cussed. It is sad that those who 
needed tbe workshops the most 
were not in attendance Maybe 
with a litUe encouragement, those 
absent will find it m their hearts to 
schedule themselves around Ibe 
activities next year.

Letters To The Editor 



President on crusade to save 
education funding 



Dear StuOcnu 

ThLs is a busy liinc for you. Bui 
while you arc choosing classes and 
making the decisions ihal will help 
you build a good life for yourself, 
the Congressional majohly is work- 
ing 10 make drastic cuts in educa- 
tion — in yout siudeni loans, in 
national scivice, and even in youi 
scholarships. And the cuts will 
jeopardize the future you and your 
generation are working toward 

1 want you lo know diat I oppose 
these cuts 1 will do everything in 
my power (o fight them and to see 
(0 it thai the dream of higher educa- 
tion lemams real for all Americans. 
[ will do this not only by defending 
the opportunities of those of you 
who arc already in college, but by 
opening the doors further to make 
sure that even greater numbers of 
deserving Americans have the 
chance to stand where you stand 
today. 

For the first time in a long time, 
leaders from both parlies are 
resolved that we must balance the 
federal budgcL From the day 1 look 
office, I've been coirunitied lo this 
goal — to gelling red of the budget 
deficit Ihal quadrupled our national 
debt in the 12 years before I came 
10 Washington So far, we have 
made gieal progress. In three years, 
we have cut the deficit nearly in 
half, fium S290 billion to S160 bil- 
lion. 

Now we are ready to eliminaie 
(be deficit entirely. On this, the 
Congressional majority and I sec 
eye to eye. 

But just how we get rid of the 
deficit is anoiher m^tcr The major- 
ity in Congress wants to balance the 
budget in seven years, and do ii 
while giving an unnecessarily large 
tax cut. But in order to do these 
things, the Congressional majority 



would make enormous cuLs m edu- 
cation 

My balanced budget plan would 
take more years than Congress' lo 
eliminate the deficit, your student 
loans, and national service safe and 
well li would also preserve our 
ability lo protect the environment 
and the iniegrity of Medicare for 
our older citizens 

Balancing the budget is about 
more than numbers It's about our 
values and our future Education 
has always been the currency of the 
Amencan Dream, When 1 was your 
age. it was assumed — based on our 
long history — that each generation 
would have a better life than pre- 
ceding one More than anything 
else, a good education is the way 
we pa.ss this vision on lo those who 
come after us. 

The facLs speak for themselves. 
Earnings for those with no post-sec- 
ondary educabon have fallen sub- 
stanlially in the last IS years The 
only people for whom earnings 
have increased steadily arc people 
exactly like you — those Americans 
with more education. Every year of 
higher education increases your 
earnings by six lo 12 percent 
Those years also mean a stronger 
overall economy and richer lives for 
those who have them 

Balancing the budget will be 
good for our economy and your 
future if [sic| it's done righl. Bui 
simply balancing the budget won't 
do us much good m the long term if 
your generation docs not have the 
education it needs to meet the chal- 
lenges of the nenl century. 

Just think over what the 
Congressional inajonty's plan, if it 
went through, would do to you. 
your classmates, and any of the one 
out of two colleges students who 
receives federal aid. It would: 
• Raise the cost_pf siudentjoans by 



SIO billion over seven years by 
charging you interest on your loan 
while you are m school. This would 
increase the cosi of a college educa- 
tion by as much as $3,100 for 
undergraduates and S9,400 for 
graduate students. 

• Deny up to 360.000 low-income 
students desperately needed Pelt 
Grants in 1996 

• Shut down Amcricorps, our 
national service iniiiaiive. which 
gives thousands of young people 
the chance to earn and save money 
for college while serving their 
country 

By contrast, my balanced budget 
plan builds on the national consen- 
sus that we must help people help 
themselves, through the power of 
education. It eliminates both of our 
deficits: our budget deficit and our 
education deficit. My plan cuts 
wasteful spending by more than SI 
trillion, but il also increases invest- 
ments in education by S40 billion 
over the next seven years 

Think over how my balanced 
budget plan would help guarantee 
your future and all the hard work 
you're about to put into it. li will; 

• Increase funding for Pell Grants 
by S3.4 billion. Almost one million 
more students would benefit from 
the scholarships. And we would 
raise the top award to $3,128 by the 
year 2002. 

• Expand Americorps to let even 
more young Americans serve iheir 
communities and go to college. 

• Protect our direct-lending pro- 
gram, which makes student loans 
more affordable, with more repay- 
ment options, and saves taxpayers. 
parents, and students billions of dol- 
lars. 

I just returned from Peart 
Harbor, where ! took part in cere- 
monies marking the 50lh anniver- 
sary of tlic end of the Second World 



War. In the late 1940s, when the 
veterans we honored left their loved 
ones to go off and serve their coun- 
try, they were the age most of you 
arc now. 

When they came home, the 
country recognized their service and 
their potential, and it responded 
with die G.I. Bill, which guaranteed 
a college education lo every renjm- 
ing veteran. Those who served 
weren't given a handout, and they 
didn't want one. They were given 
the opportunity they needed lo lake 
responsibility for their lives 

Your generation has iLs own bat- 
tles to wage You face the choice of 
doing something nght and difficult 

— or somediing easy and wrong 

In taking on the respoasibitity of 
educating yourselves, you have 
chosen the righl and difficult path 
Vou did the work you had to do to 
gel into college. You may be work- 
ing now to pay your way. And your 
tamdy may have worked long hours 
and make great sacrifices to help 
you get where you are today. 

You deserve the nation's sup- 
port. And your future success will 
likely repay our common invest- 
ment, I do not accept the argumenu. 
of those who condemn irresponsi- 
bility in young Americans and then 
seek lo deny the nation's helping 
hand lo die millions of you who are 
doing the righl diings. 

I hope you'll suppon my efforts 
10 proteci education and balance Uie 
budget. The fight for education is 
the fight for your future. In my life 

— and in the lives of countless 
Americans — education has meant 
the difference between die impossi- 
ble and the possible. It should be 
irue in your lives, loo. With your 
help, we'll keep it that way. 

President William'J.iClinlon. 



Student questions polls legitimacy 



There is something fishy about 
the Mastodon Poll in the Thursday. 
September IS (sic), 1995 issue of 
The Communicalor Immediately 
three things strike my senses and 
catch my attention Ifishy, poll, 
strike, catch . get it?). 

First, the mix of polices- nearly 
2/3 female Were there more 
females on campus the day of the 
poll, or is ttiai die approximaie pro- 
portion of women to men in society 
&lt;al least in NE Indiana), or the cur- 
rent ratio of ladies to gentlemen at 
IPFW. or was there some oiher cri- 
terion for selecting your sample on 
this hard-core feminist lssuc? 

Second, the statisiical result 
(here 1 am making an assumption 
that "positive" means more abor- 
tions a prelude to a striking thing 
number three) The 24% of "No 
Opinion" added to the 46% of 
"Positive" gives a whopping 75% 
who think (or don't care) that the

new Indiana law, being held in 
abeyance by the courts, will result 
in more abortions. For any given 
group of women in a given period 
of time, fewer abortions must result 
due to the extended time between 
theu' scheduling and the procedure. 
Now, I'm not accusing The 
Communicalor of biasing the result 
with its blatant "ami" attitude as 
displayed in the accompanying arti- 
cle and cartoon. In that you are only 
parroting your media brethren, or 
sistien (or cistern?) In fact, I sus- 
pect the polices, not of prejudice 
(thai would be evil!), but possibly 
of "affirmative action?" 

Third, the ambiguous wording of 
the question. "What affect [sic| will 
an 18-hour wailing penod have on 
abortions?" could only have been a 
legitimate question for an essay or 
possibly a true/false quiz if the 
choices were "more abortions" or 
"fewer abortions." To accentuate 



the ambiguity of your "positive" or 
"negative" framing of die result, let 
me ask a question based on another 
issue currently before the Indiana 
legislature "What will be the effect 
of lowcnng the blood alcohol level 
used in determining whether one is 
driving drunk?" Now, frame the 
result in terms of positive or ncga- 
live. If the pollee correctly pre- 
sumes the number of drunks on the 
road will be increased by defimtion 
of who b a drunk dnvcr. he or she 
may answer, "Negative." Is that 
negative good or bad? If you had 
asked. "Will ihe 18-hout wailing 
period between scheduling and per- 
forming an abortion result in more 
or fewer abortions?" I suspect your 
statistics would have been diffeient. 
You might still have gotten a high 
percentage of "No Opinion" - 
manicind (I use Die tcmn in its new 
single-sex sense) has an innaie sen- 
sibility not to suppon the opposing 



position on any supremely feminist 

In conclusion, i paraphrase your 
Mr Becklcy. "You do the [remedi- 
al! math."

Letter to Rettler: 
TALK IS CHEAP! 




Diversity, according to the chan- 
cellor, is a pertinent is^ue facing 
our campus. And I agree. 
However, my mind, soul, and body 
are conunitled to maicin^ this cam- 
pus a diverse 
environment 
Too bad the 
chancellor 
cannot say the 
same 

Talk IS

Melissa *°^^\ 

Young-Flores ^ *"'' 

^ ago today, the 

Taks thatt chancellor's 
office, in con- 
junction with other univetiity fac- 
ulty, sponsored a student panel dis- 
cussion on diversity. I, as a member 
of the panel, believed the idea was 
an open forum for the student panel 
and audicna' lo interact and try to 
resolve our diversity problems. 

1 commend die faculty, students. 
and administration who took the 
lime to actively parlicipaic in the 
discussion. But the chancellor was 
nowhere lobe seen, 

1 understand the chancellor is a 
busy man, but is he too busy to 
hear what the student body had to 
say about the issue? So being the 
inquisitive reporter that i am, 1 
started last Tuesday morning by 
asking the chancellor a quesliun 
posed by nearly every siudeni on 
the panel. Why was Ihe chancellor 
absent from the discussion? 

He said there were several dis- 
cussions and events happening dur- 
ing the two day sessions, and It was 
hard lo allend every event 

And 1 suppose I could entertain 
and respect this answer if he were 
Joe Schreoe off of tho street Bui a*' 
the leader of thi^-univcrMiy it is his 
responsibility to ensure the diversi- 
ty of this campus. God forbid he 
may have lo take some face-lo-face 
heat because students are nut happy 
widi sections of their experience at 
IPFW But at least I could compli- 
ment him for acting like a mature 



aduh. 

None Ihe less our interview 
continued, and being dte inquisitive 
reporter that 1 am. 1 repeatedly 
asked questions of the chancellor. 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Frank Dorelli and Associate 
Professor of Sociology and 
Anthropology Judith Dilorio that 
directly related to the views 
expressed and discussed during the 
panel discussion. But obviously Ihe 
chancellor did not feel my inquiries 
were passive enough for his liking. 
Much to my dismay he proceeded 
to chasti.sc me in front of his col- 
leagues and spoke to me in a con- 
descending tone. 

Well, dear sir, wiih all due 
respect. I am an adult and if an 
aggressive female scares you so 
much you have to avoid her ques- 
tions and demean her. then I 
believe you have a rough road 
ahead Just keep in mind women 
make up a over half of diis nauon. 

And perhaps you need lo attend 
a course on diversity so you may 
learn women are not dumb, and not 
all 19-ycar-olds arc leenic boppcrs. 
I suggest a visli lo Kinder Care: 
pre-school teachers stress proper 
manners. 

I don't know why I did not walk 
out after I adamantly defended 
myself, but ironically, conversation 
continued and not more than five 
minuies later he staled. "We as a 
university need to treat our students 
as our clients, our customers." 

If Ihis university were 
McDonalds, Wariell would be 
mailing oui 1 1 ,01 1 "Be our Guest" 
cards, and offering me a free visit 
tohisesiablishmenl. 

According lo his own words, 
we. as siudenLs. pay his salary with 
our tax doll^^ and tuition. It is his 
rcspotuibility ID give each us the 
retipeci wo deserve not only as 
humans, but also as his boss, 

I'm sure he would sec this dif- 
ferently, but 1 guess diat is left to 
die eye of the beholder.

many others. 

"Most of them have newsletters

Right now Mensa has 170

Seasons change. Fall begins 



by Janet Tobey 
Features Editor 

A (ew years ago. recent graduates of a 
well-known university were asked Ihe ques- 
tion, "What causes Ihe seasons?" 

Only approximately 20 percent could 
answer the question correctly. The universi- 
ty? Harvard. 

Dipak Chowdhury, professor of geology, 
wants every one of his students to be able to 
answer the question. 

Just so you know, and can feel supenor lo 
the Harvard grads. here is an explanation in a 
nutshell from Chowdhury: 

The hunh's rotational .ixjs is tilled at 23 5 degrees 



from die perpendicular to the ecliptic, or the plane on 
which the orbital path of the Earlh lies 

That means Ihal for part of the year Ihc northern hemi- 
sphere is tilted toward Ihe sun. 

"During the summer months, 
the sun IS north of the equator and 
falls directly on ihe northern hemi- 
sphere. At the same time, Ihe sun falls 
on the southern hemisphere at a 
slant" said Chowdhury 

As a result, the days are 
longer than nights in ihe northern 
hemisphere, and nights longer than 
days m the southern hemisphere 
Six months later, all is reversed. The sun is south of 
the equ.tior (on Uii; tropic of Cipricom) and we in the 




north have winter. 

If the Earth's axis weren't lilted, we would have no 
seasons, because the sun would shine directly on the 
equator year-round. 

The fall or autumnal equinox wcurs this year on Sept 
23 at9:14a.m. 

"At that time, the sun wil! be directly over the equa- 
tor," said Chowdhury. "After that, the sun will be in ihe 
southern hemisphere." 

So Saturday, it's lime to say good-bye to sununcr, 
hello 10 fall.

Limhau^h Exposed: Fun for fans and foes 



by Jeff Bruason 
Staff Wril«r 

The Way Things Aren't: Rush 
Limbaugh's Reign of Error by 
Steven Rendail, Jim Naureckas, and 
Jeff Cohen, The New Press. 128 
pages $6.95, 

He's on a local right-wing lalk 
radio station three hours a day, Tive 
days a week. He delivers a half 
hour partisan political monologue 
each week night on ibe local Fox 
television affiliale. His books arc 
available in siores, and his face is 
plastered on billboards, all over this 
town. 

Rush Limbaugh is culturally 
omnipresent m I-ort Wayne and per- 
vasive throughout the nation. Mis 
stridently conservative views .in 
broadcast daily on over 900 omi- 
mercial radio and telcvismn sm- 
lions, as well as the Armed Forces 
Radio and Television Service and 
short-wave In addition to his own 
shows and a newsletter bearing his 
name, Limbaugh's media presence 
is further fell through guesi appear- 
ances as an "experi " on shows like 
"Nigbtline." "Today," and "This 
Week With David Brinkley." 

"Ttc Way Things Aren't; Rush 
Limbaugh's Reign of Error" cites 
and debunks over 100 of 
Limbaugh's fallacious siaiemenis 
concerning a dazzling array of 
issues The book also includes 
background information and analy- 
sis on Limbaugh that helps to 
explain bow this son of a corporate 
lawyer parleyed bigoiry. smugness, 
and corporate servility into an 
income in excess of S18 million pet 
year. 

Contrary lo Limbaugh's boot- 
strapping boasts, for example, he 
got his first job as a radio show host 
"thanks to the fact dial his dad was 
pan-owner of die station " His big 
bn;ak in radio came in I98S, when 
Ihe ABC Radio Network siruck a 
deal with him, transforming 
Limbaugh from an obscure talk 
jock in Sacrunento into a national 
radio celebnty. 

With this exposure, Limbaugh 
has made contributions to the 
naiional dialogue like the following. 



eiied in " Tlic Way Things Aren't": 

• To a caller who said thai black 
people need to be heard: "They are 
12 percent of the population. Who 
the hell cires?" (Radio. Flush Rush) 
-On NAFTA: "If we are going 
to sian rewarding no skills and stu- 
pid pcoplc^I'm serious, let the 
unskilled jobs. Icl the kinds of jobs 
thai take absolutely no knowledge 
whatsoever to do^lct stupid and

unskilled Mexicans do that work," 
(Radio; Flush Rush Quarterly, 
Fall/93) 

""Feminism was established so 
that una ilrac live women could have 
easier access to die mamsiream of 
society." (Limbaugh's "35 
Undeniable Trudis") 

Sueh Limbaughisms help to 
place Dan Quayle's assenion thai 
"To take a close look at Rush 
Hudson Limbaugh and his twenty 
million tans is lo have one's hope m 



America's future restored," in iis 
proper context. The best Ihmj! 
about this book, however, are itu 
whoppers it (lays. Consider the fol 
lowing samples: 

•Limbaugh: "Anita Hill ful 
lowed Clarence Thomas ever\ 
where. Wherever he went, slu 
wanied to be right by his side, sIj, 
wanted to work widi him. she 
ed to continue to date him Thti^ 
were no other accusers who cann 
forth after Anita Hill did and sail 
'Yeah. Clarence Thomas, hi- 
harassed me. too ' There was none 
of thai "(TV. 5/4/95) 

Reality: Hill could hardly have 
"continued to dale" Thomas since, 
by both their accounts, they never 
dated Two oiher women, Sukari 
Hardneit and Angela Wnghi, came 
forward immediately afier Anita 
Hill lo charge Thomas with similar 
behavior (Strange Justice by Mayer 
and Abramson) 

•Limbaugh: "Banks lake Ihe 
nsks in issuing student loans and 
ihey are entitled to the profits " 
(Radio; FRQ. Summer/93) 

Reality. Banks take no risks in 
issuing student loans, which are 
federally insured. 

I strongly recommend this book 
for Limbaugh fans and critics ahke. 
Diitoheads will appreciate it's 
brevity (its practically a pamphlet) 
and the relative dearth of big words 
ihat arc hard lo understand. Those 
who can't siand Limbaugh will find 
wcll-documenied confirmation that 
Limbaugh is what they probably 
already think he is

Gebhart added diat the athletic 
department would like to expand 
upon the ideas used over the week- 
end. He envisions an entire week- 
end focused on fall sports, alumni, 
the Fort Wayne community and the 
campus. 

"We do not want to call it a 
homecoming, but that is son of the 
idea. We would like to include vari-

Uke to see such groups as PIT and

After the success of the inaugur-

ning more events for the future. The 
next big event on the calendar is a

held in the Gates Center parking lot. 
Entry forms are avaiUible at vanous 
locations throughout the community 
and at the department of aUiletics on 
the second lloor of the Gates Spons 
Center. 

"I am in the planning stages of 
bringing a number of new and

like to see the faculty and staff get

criminating and unfounded opin 

ions 

Bannister is the 
man that wowed the 
world when he 
became the first 
human to run a mile 
m less than four mm- 



Though he is a medical doctor in 
England now. Bannister provided 
no evidence lo suppon his claims. 
No. he simply opened bis mouth 
and out came thus garbage. He even 
went as far as to say that he knows 
that people will disagree with his 
views and label his "politically 
incorrect" bul that was OK with 
him. Oh, so that should excuse his 
ignorance and stupidity? I do not 
think that is the case. 

This is a s.id and di-tturbing com- 
mentary on the state of the world 
Greek" and and the sponing community in gen- 
eral. Docs it really make a differ- 
ence what color a man or woman's 
skin color is' How about effon and 
heart? Since when did good old 
fashion training go out of style? 

The lime has come to exclude 
race, color and creed 



That 



1954 Today, any 
decent distance runner 
can accompUsh a sub- 
four minute mile. 

Bannister however, 
chose to aim his 
attacks at the shorter 
distances, the sprints. According to 
Bannister, the reason that black 
sprinters are more successful than 
any other race can be allhbulcd to 
genes. Bannister said that blacks 
have less body fat beneath their 
skin, have longer Achilles tendons 
and have muscles that are acclimat- 
ed to hot climates and thus produce 
energy more quickly than their 
counterparts. For this reason, said 
Bannister, blacks are far and away 
better athletes. 

Like Jimmy 'the Greek," who 
was fired by ABC for stating that 
blacks are bred for competition, and 
Campams who resigned under pres- 
sure from the Los Angles Dodgers 
organization for his racial innuen- 
does. Bannister is showing his igno- 
rance. 



The time has 

come to exclude 

race, color arnd 

creed from the 

measure of an 

individuals worth. 

in the sporting 

world as well as 

society as a 

whole. 



from the measure of an 
individuals worth, in 
the sporting world as 
well as society as a 
whole When will we 
all Hnally realize that 
it is not the color of an 
individuals skin or the 
genes that make up 
individuals that deter- 
mine his or ber athletic 
success? In many 
cases it is the athlete's 

heart that determines 

his eventual victories. 

It is unlikely prejudice and big- 
otry will ever disappear from the 
sports world as long as we continue 
to pay heed lo individuals such as 
Bannister without repercussions. 

Take it as you will, just remem- 
ber,., the view from under the 
bleachers is not always a pretty

Lying face down on ihe (raining 
table, HeaUicr Per/.anowski ginger- 
ly applies ice to her aching back 
and quadriceps muscles. They are 
not really injuries to speak of, jusl 
litllc nagging muscle aches that 
plague ihe Mastodon's number iwo 
singles tennis player 

"In August I was in an accident 
and I guess the muscles just do not 
go back to where they arc supposed 
10 go," said Per/anowski. "I was 
going 45 (m.p.b.) when a car pulled 
out in front of me; llicy bad a stop 



sign and did nol sec il." 

Per/anowski was layed up for 
Iwo weeks at a most inopportune 
lime. She could not compete for 
more than two weeks while the rest 
of the team was already practicing 

Tbe nagging pain is the least of 
Per/anowski's concerns, however 
The women's tennis team has slrug- 
gled all season Now with only 
three weeks left in the season it 
looKs as Uiougn tncy may noi (|uaii- 
fy for the conference loumamcnt, 

"Thai is discouraging There are 
a lot of rule changes this year. Last 
season you could win the confer- 
ence individually but nol diis year. 



This year il is all a team competi- 
tion," she said. 

In addition to the aches and 
pains and the mie changes, die team 
lost its number one player a day 
prior to the first malch, 

"This is the first weekend that 
we have had a full team Our num- 
ber one quit school the day before 
our first maich," said Perzanowski. 

The loss of the team's number 
one player forced Head Coach Dan 
Brogan lo move all of his players 
up another spot on the team A lot 
of the players have played out of 
position in order lo compensate for 
Ihe loss.

Against SlU-E. die results were 
die same, the scores just were not 
as close on the 'Don's side ol die 
net. The biggest surprise of the 
match came as IPI^'s number one 
singles player, Carrie Claypool 
bowed out to Amy Hazen, 6-0 and 
6-0. In the match the only 
Mastodon player to win more than 
three games in a set was English at 
number six singles. She lost 6-3 
and 6-4 to Amy Colter. 



"I am really about a number four 
or five player. I finished second at 
numtK-r six last year, but this year I 
am playing at number Iwo, I still 
have a way lo go before 1 am ai 
number two," added Perzanow.ski. 

"It has been a really discourag- 
ing .senior year," said Perzanowski, 
'"] had hoped to come in playing 
number four after last season. Now, 
[ am at number two. The team has 
really stuck together though We 
only have three^ players back from 
last year, and we played four, five 
and six. It just kinda slinks as my 
senior year." 

All of her accomplishments 
taken into consideration, it is hard 
to believe that Perzanowski has 
only been playing tennis since her 
sophomore year of high school. 

"My friends played so I decided 
that I would try il too, I had never 
played before; i just picked it up. 
The only other members of my 
family that play tennis arc my dad 
and brother," said Penanowski. 

Perzanowski sees herself as 
improving on and off the court. 
Though she says that she is a more 
focused person on the court, she is a 



quick learner in the classroom. She 
will graduate after next semester 
and hopes to secure a teaching posi- 
tion in the area 

"I feel as diough I am improving 
mostly because I am playing 
against better opponents, I'm trying 
to keep a positive attitude. 
but il is hard, 'she said 

Through all o( the dis- 
couragement and pain. 
Per/anowski has still been 
able to fix us on her 
education As a 
senior on the hon 
ors list, she hopes 
thai she can set an 
example for the 
younger players, Ii 
still not the wa 
that she would 
like for her col-
