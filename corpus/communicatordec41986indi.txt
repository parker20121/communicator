Barrett honored 
for teaching quaUty 

By MARY POPOVICH 
Staff Writer 

Development of computer-related courses for the IPFW continuing education 
department has earned a leaching encellence award for Robert A. Barrett, 
a.ssociale dean of engineering, technology and nursing. 

The award was presented to Barrett and three other statewide recipienU by the 
Indiana University school of continuing studies in Bloomington Nov. 14. 

Barrel! was cited at the awards presentation for his work in leaching and 
developing a wide range of computer courses. 

For Barrett, the award tsfhe highlight of seven years' involvement with IPFW's 
continuing education program. But he said the award also represented the work of 
many other people involved behind the scenes, "It's a shame that Ihe award's 
giveii to a person I individually) , because I think there's a whole group of faculty on 
campus thai are also involved." he said. "There isn't a faculty member here who 
hasn't done something," 

Nineteen computer-related courses were offered by continuing education during 
the fall of 1986, Offerings ranged from Barrett's introductory microcomputer 
course to highly specialized topics such as those involving the use of individual 
software packages Learning lo use Print Shop and Newsroom. WordPerfect and 
Appleworks packages were bul a few of thechoices available 

Barren said Ihe continuing education classes evolved f»om "a great need of 
people lo know about compulers and what you can do with them " He said the 
classes are an 'ideal match" for people with very specific needs Most people 
■'don't want lo go to a 16-week semester course and cover a whole wide range o( 
material jusi lo gel Ihe one little piece that they really wani," he observed. 

Another growing area involving joint efforts by IPFW computer technology and 
i;ontinuing education departments is in-house courses for area industry. Barrett 
said some of these courses take place on site al the company, and others at the 
IPFW campus, In-house courses have already been conducted for several local 
corporalions, including Central Soya. Dana, Uniroyal. Goodrich, Tokheim, Essex 
and General Motors, 

Barrel! says his involvement with continuing studies is one of two of his 
achievcmenU al IPFW of which he is most proud. The other is his work in 
upgrading the department of computer technology. 

Barren and the deparlmenl of computer technology have seen a lot of changes 
since 1979. when he first came to IPFW as an instructor. Barrett was promoted to 
chair of computer technology in 1983. Then, in January 1985, he officially became 
associate dean ot the division of engineering, technology and nursing. 

Barrel! holds two associate's degrees, in data processing and operations 
management, from I.U.'s former D,G,T,S. downtown. In addition, he has 
bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration from l.U. 

His wife Pam and his son Randall both work with computers in their professions, 
"so we're almost like a computerized family," Barrett quips. Ironically, though, 
he does iiol have a computer at home. "I have two In my office, I don't want one at 
home." he said.

Stories circulating around campus 
regarding a possible move ot Follett's 
Into Walb Memorial Union Building, 
with a resulting loss of cafeteria space, 
have some basis in fact, according to 
John Ulmer, dean of students. 

In accordance with Chancellor 
ThomasWallace's"Studyof the Nature 
and Quality of Undergraduate Life at 
IPFW," initialed in September, 
possible actions to improve the 
educational process at IPFW are being 
evaluated. 

According to Ulmer, the study's 
working group has discussed the 
possibility of opening up new building 
space by moving the IPFW bookstore 
from its current location in the 
basement ofKettler Hall to space in the 



Student Union Building currently oc- 
cupied by the cafeteria. 

The cafeteria would not be relocated, 
resulting in a partial or complete loss of 
the facility, Ulmer stressed, however, 
Ihat this action is simply an idea, 
brought about in response to requests 
by units in Kettler Hall to move into 
larger areas. He continued to say that 
"no nuts and bolts" of the plan have 
been discussed, 

Jim Ward, manager of Follett's, 
staled that he has heard "just rumors" 
about the plan, and nothing from IPFW 
officials. He also expressed a feeling 
thai despite the several years 
remaining on die store's lease, it could 
be moved whenever a concrete decision 
might be made, 

Ulmer also said llial additional 
'Changes to the newly furnished lounge 
in Ketller were nol likely because ol the 
plan under consideration. 

Also as a result of the Chancellor's 
efforts to improve this campus, a 
Women's Center, which opened 
November 19, was added to the Walb 
Memorial Union Building, This caused 
tlie loss of a television lounge, aboul 
which some students have raised 
questions Ulmer said thai Ihe decision 
lo place Ihe new center in Walb was 
made by the Chancellor after the TV 
lounge was found to be Ihe "one area 
most under utilized." Also, thai par- 
ticular room IS relatively central. 
Ulmer explained there is a well used 
television in the Classroom- Medical 
Building and in the Walb Memorial 
Umon Building's fireside lounge. He 
also said the loss of the single TV lounge 
would probably not he "a catastrophic 
loss" lo the students.

A lecture entitled, "Gee, Another

20 in Neff Hall, The deliverance ol this 
lecture by Lowell W, Beineke. professor 
of mathematics, was part ot being

This was nol the fir^t time Beineke has

Schrey Professorship on May 16, 1986. 
"This is Ihe highest honor a university 
can give lo a faculty member." said 
Joanne Lanlz, assistant vice chancellor 
and dean ol academic services. 

"It encourages me lo try harder," 
said Beineke, 46, a distinguished 
mathematician and acclaimed graph 
theorist. He was Ihe first named 
professorship in the hislory of IPFW. 

From a news release dated May 16, 
1966, "Purdue President Steven C, 
Beering told the trustees in recom- 
mending Ihe appointment r 'The 
creation of a named professorship at 
the Fort Wayne campus signals the 
beginning of a new era of recognition of 
distinguished scholarship at the 
regional campuses throughout the 
slate. There will be many more ap- 
pointments- like this one in the years to 
tume, and Professor Beineke is an 
ousianding choice for IPFWs first.' 

"Edward A. Nicholson, acting 
chancellor of IPFW, noted that 
Professor Beineke has achieved a well- 
deserved reputation as an international 
scholar in the field ot graph theory. His 
colleagues rank him among the lop 
graph theorists in the world. His 
students rate him the best teacher in his 
department. All who meet him ap- 
preciate this gentle, unassuming man 
whose copious research and excellent 
leaching record have brought such 
credit lo the university.'" 

The professorship was established in 
memory ol Jack W. Schrey who died in 
December. 1985al the ageof 69. Schrey. 
a long-lime supporter of IPFW. was the 
former chairman ol Magnavox 
Government &amp; Industrial Electronics 
Company, and he was a member of 
IPFWs Community Advisory Council. 
The employees from Magnavox 
Government &amp; Industrial Electronics 
Company, friends ot Jack Schrey, and 
the Frank Friemann Foundation 
financed the Jack W- Schrey 
Professorship.

Basketball players 
penalized because of 
NCAA rule violations 



The iNalionol Collegiale AthleUc 
Associflllon (NCAA) hus once again em- 
barras-scd Ihcmselves in another fulile at- 
lempl lo show Iheir authority. This lime they 
have taken disciplinary actiotis against five 
college basketball players for performing in 
the movie Hooslers. 

Four players, including IPFW's Jimmy 
Rayl, were ordered to sil out their club's first 
three Barnes and to return ihe money they 




earned (or tJieir bnef appearances in the 
movie (Rayl received $100 while the others 
brought home (50 or les.sl. 

The case of Steve Hollar is a little more 
complicated than the others. Hollar, a fresh- 
man at DePauw University, earned JIS.OOO 
(or his portrayal of Rade Butcher It seems 
doubtful thai the NCAA can force him to hand 
over that amount of money, especially since 
he spent it on tuition. Nevertheless, an 
eligiblUly committee will review his possible 
repayment in mid-December. 

The reason for all of Ihe disciplinary ac- 
Uons, according to NCAA officiols, is that the 
playere used their basketball skills for profit. 
a violation of NCAA rules. What the in- 
competents heading the NCAA don't realize is 
that the five were hired as actors and not 
athletes, Thefact that Ihey portrayed aUitetes 
should not be any of the NCAAs business. 

Wouldn't it be nice if NCAA officials would 
slick lo worrying about the real problems in 
college sports? Drug abuse, point-shaving 
scandals and items being given as signing 
bonuses are only three of the many illegal 
activities taking place. Surely they should 
lake precedence over minor idiotic rule in- 
fractions. 

Many may recall Ihe Steve Alford incident 
of a year ago, Alford received a one game 
suspension for allowing his picture to appear 
in a calendar benefitting a charity. Alford 
didn't receive a penny of the calendar's 
fH-ofils, yet was still punished. 

It is obviously time that some major 
changes be made lo the NCAA rule book 
These ridiculous suspensions are quickly 
making a farce out of the entire organiiation. 




Wallace needs support 
if IPFW is to grow 



»&gt;^ *'-&lt;^ 



Faculty: an untapped IPFW resource 



In Ihe recent past, rumors started cir- 
culating around IPFW. What were they about 
this lime? As usual, the chancellor. 

Rumors began surfacing when Purdue 
University President Steven Beering flew lo 
Fori Wayne, with little advance notice, to 
meet with representative facully members. 
Beering decided that a "representative 
group" consisted of members of last years 
chancellor search and screen commillee. 
Chancellor Ihomas Wallace and Vice 
Chancellors John Carnaghi and Edward 
Nicholson were not in attendance. Wallace 
and Carnaghi said ihey were busy in finance 
meetings with Fred Ford. Beering's 
assistant 

The topics reportedly discussed at the 
meeting ranged from renaming our 
university, keeping Indiana University 
programs in tacl at IPFW, the academic 
reorganization ol IPFW from departments to 
schools, lo budget requests fur tlie completion 
of funding for a fine arts building. 

If, indeed, such important topics were to be 
discussed, why was such a hurried meeting 
called by Beering' He notified IPFW faculty 
the same morning he wanted the meeting to 
be conducted. Word had it that Beering, in 
actuality, plannedto discuss the supression or 
even dismissal of Chancellor Wallace. 

Facully members say ihe search and 



screen committee is defunct: why call them 
together again to discuss matters which are 
supposedly controlled by the campus chan- 

Representatives from Beering's office say 
Beering met with the group to thank them lor 
the job they did in choosing such a qualified 
chancellor. Approximately four months after 
the fact? Did this justify a last-minute flight 
to Fort Wayne'' 

Chancellor Wallace is a highly qualified 
professional who does not deserve lo have 
rumors circulating concerning his per- 
formance or Beering's lack of support for his 
[woposed changes. 

In less than one semester. Wallace has 
gained the respect and support of our com- 
munity and has noticeably improved morale 
aroundlPFW.Wefinally have a strong, vocal 
chancellor after many years ol waiting 

II is not fair to Wallace lo appoint him to 
Ihis position, ask him to make changes for the 
belter, then not give him the administrative 
support be needs and deserves. It appears 
Ihere is now a lack of faith, understanding 
and communication between Purdue and 
IPFW 

IPFW has become used lo "all laik. no 
action," Such is no longer the case with 
Wallace's leadership. It seems obvious that 
someone, somewhere, is afraid of this. 



Slije (jtcnrammfcotor 



From casual observation 
of other faculty in Netf Hall, 
i have gotten an impression 
that I suspect would be borne 
out by more systematic 
investigation: student use of 
professorial office hours 
'outside of advising) seems 
to lie somewhere between 
negligible and nil. To use 
myself as an example, 
although I have eleven hours 
of posted office consultation 
lime, seldom lexcept, alas, 
right before an exam) do I 
spend more than one or two 
liours per week of thai time 
working with students. 
Whatever the actual per- 
cenlages, it seems clear that 
students utilize professors' 
office hours much less than 
Ihey might. 

Well, why should students 
want lo? The answer to this 
leads directly to the 
question, "Why be in college 
at all?" and, thus, lo larger 
issues like "What, if any. 
sorts of aclivilies are in- 
trinsically worthwhile?" 
and. indeed. "What, if any. Is 
the meaning of life?" Heavy 
questions, indeed. 

To address this topic, 1 
must introduce some 
unavoidably technical 
language Suppose that 
someone believes that the 
only rationale for the 



Commentary 

by Richard Double 
assistant professor of philosophy 



academic part of college 
ne,, courses, rather than, 
e g,, socializing) is that it is 
an instrument ( 'necessary 
evil') that leads to grades, 
credits, diplomas, and 
certificates so that one may 
get on with the really im- 
portant things in life, lUf^, 
making money and spending 
il Let me define this lin an 
unbiased way, of course) as 
Ihe "crass theory" of 
college Now, to the extent 
ihai persons hold the crass 
view, it IS reasonable for 
them lo avoid their 
professors like the cliched 
plague, provided, of course, 
fhat they are getting from 
academics the desired in- 
strumental goods, viz. 
credits, grades, and so on. 
On this theory, the attitude 
"Why talk lo your professor 
if you are satisfied with your 
grade?" is eminently 
reasonable. 

There is, however, an 
opposing view that holds that 
Itie rationale of academics 
itoes not lie in the ac- 



cumulation of grades, 
credits, diplomas, and, 
ultimately, money We 
might, equally technically, 
call this the "non-crass 
theory " This theory consists 
of such controversial tenets 
"Education Is valuable 



for 



iake," 



"Developing one's mint) is 
oneofthe best things one can 
do with one's time," "Being 
able to think for oneself is 
better than getting all of 
one's beliefs and values by 
unreflective osmosis," and 
"There is a point, easily 
reached by most of us in our 
fortunate technological 
society, past which devoting 
one's hie to maximizing 
material goods and pleasure 
is childish and obscene." 

One who holds Ihe non- 
crass theory, on the face of 
it, would seem logically 
committed, in principle, to 
increasing the quahty of 
education Ihey receive in 
their courses by consulting 
with their professors outside 
of class, l"In principle" 
because one can imagine 



constraints that might 
prevent a non-crass theorist 
from doing so, e,g,, literally 
not having enough lime or 
energy.) Who is in a better 
position to lend insight into 
classroom and related topics 
than one's professors. 
(Knowledgeable people can 
often dispel in a sentence 
confusions thai are other- 
wise debililaling.l For most 
students, their un- 
dergraduate professors, 
collectively, constitute the 
most intellectual and high- 
minded group of persons 
they will meet in their entire 
lives, ("High-minded" does 



double~duty here; nolonly do 
your profs commit their lives 
to learning, they are not 
trying lo sell you anything 
lexcept maybe the non-crass 
values sketched above) , Ihey 
are not trying to manipulate 
you for their own gain.) 

I have avoided carefully 
the issue of whether the 
crass or non-crass theory is 
better, happy to simply draw 
out what seem to be the 
consequences of accepting 
the two views. There are 
several hundred employees 
of IPFW who would be happy 
to discuss that issue with you 
and you know who they are.

IPFW mathematician 
receives professorsliip 



(Continued from Page I) 

A native of Decatur. 
Beincke graduated from 
Purdue University in West 
Lafnycltc with a bachelor's 
degreein 1961, and he earned 
his master's and doctoral 
degrees at the University of 
Michigan in 1%5 On his own 
initiative, he came lo IPFW 
seeking a faculty posiLon. In 
January. 1965, Maynard J. 
Mansfield, professor and 
chair of the department of 
mathematical sciences, 
offered him an appointment 
which was accepted and 
imptemenled the following 
fall of that year 

Mansfield noted "Beineke 
has written three respected 
books on graph theory and 
nearly 60 articles, as well as 
being invited to present 
papers and speak at 
numerous internalional 
mathematics symposia." 
Mansfield said (he first 
doctoral dissertation 
completed in Indiana under 
the supervision ot a regional- 
campus professor was 
directed by Beineke. This 
information was excerpted 



from the news release dated 

May 16, isee, 

Mansfield nominated 
Beineke for the Schrey 
Professorship in a letter to 
Nicholson dated November 
12, 1985. In this letter. 
Mansfield staled the 
following: "Professor 
Beineke has accomplished 
his record of research and 
scholarship while carrying 
leaching loads that ranged 
from eleven to twelve credit 
hours in Ihe early years of 
his IPFW association, down 
to eight lo nine hours in the 
recent past While some 
might consider such loads 
oppressive, Lowell Beineke 
has been known to suggest 
thai he doesn't get lo teach 
enough Indeed, it is his 
leaching in which he takes 
Ihe greater, personal pride 
and satisfaction. His 
students clearly recognize 
the excellence of his 
leaching; his student 
evaluations are the best in 
the department I would 
rank him among the top five 
graph theorists in the 




*' 'Professor Beineke has accomplish- 
ed his record of research and scholarship 
while carrying teaching loads that ranged 
from eleven to twelve credit hours... 
While some might consider such loads 
oppressive, Lowell Beineke has been

teach enough.' " (Photo by Kris Cargle) 



Beineke tocdc a leave of 
absence for one year lo 
travel to England lo leach 
under the Fulbright In- 
lernatlonal Faculty Ex- 
change Program. "This 
experience helped me as a 
teacher," he said. While 
livinH abroad, Bein^e's wife 



Judith, who is from England. 
and their children, Jennifer 
and Phillip, enriched their 
own hves as well. Beineke 
enjoyed Yorkshire and 
London the most and would 
like lo see these two places 
again. 
The 2S0th Anniversary 



Conference on Graph Theory 
was held at IPFW March IS- 
IS, 1986. This was the fir^t 
major conference of which 
Beineke helped organize. 
Eighteen states and four 
countries were represented 
at this successful con- 
ference. 

Currently Beineke, in 
collaboration wilh Robin J. 
Wilson, a renowned 
mathematician from 
England, has another book 
on Graph Theory near 
completion. This will be a 
third volume in a series on 
this subject to date. 

Lpast summer marked the 
beginning of a three year 
navel research contract at 
IPFW, Beineke will be 
working on this project 
during the summer months 
with Raymond E, Pipperl, 
professor of mathematics, 
Marc J. Lipman, associate 
professor of malhemalics 
and Kunwarjit S. Bagga, 
visiting assistant professor 
of malhematical sciences. 
Beineke views this assign- 
ment as a challenge. 

Beineke's future 
aspirations Include more 
research, continued writing, 
and, of course, teaching. "I 
couldn't think of a job I e^joy 



more than teaching 
malhemalics. ' Beineke 
said. He would like to travel 
abroad under the Fulbright 
Internalional Faculty Ex- 
change Program to 
Australia and New Zealand. 
He prefers to wail, however, 
until his son and daughter 
are older before doing so. 

In 1978, Beineke received 
the AMOCO Outstanding 
Teacher Award and is listed 
in the Who's Who in the 
Midwest and American Men 
&amp; Women in Science. He 
retains membership on the 
editorial board of (he 
"Journal ot Graph Theory," 
London Mathematical 
Society, Mathematical 
Association of America, 
American Association ol 
University Professors, ihe 
American Malhematical 
Society, and the Society of 
the Sigma Xi. 

On Thursday, Nov, 20, 
1986, a party was held in 
Beineke's honor by his 
family, friends, and 
colleagues. This was a 
memorable occasion for 
everyone in attendance 
Lantz said il was (heir 
special way of saying, 
"We're proud of you, Dr 
Beineke."

Eating disorders very destructive 



By MICHELLE LYNN 

ERTEL 

Staff Writer 

Eating disorders are very 

common among young girb. 

The two most common 

eating disorders are bulimia 

and anorexia nervosa. 

The disorders are a result 
from societies expectations 
of how we should look. The 
way we think about food is 
thus distorted. 

People who are considered 
bulimic are emotionally 
depent on food with varying 
degrees of addiction. The 
bulimic has a low self- 
esteem and an obsession 
with weight and food. The 
bulimic will overeat to 
compensate for stress and 



will feel guilty for overeating 
and will self -induce vomiting 
to eliminate the guilty 
feelings. 

Recovery from buhmia is 
possible and essential before 
the bulimic kills her or 
himself. The first step in- 
volves the bulimic to seek 
therapy. The bulimic must 
admit to themselves that 
they have a problem. The 
second step begins with 
therapy. They must confront 
the issues surrounding 
bulimia Recovery from 
bulimia means working 
through the fundamental 
issues of obsession over 
weight and food, body image 
distortion, fears of gaining 
weight and tow self-esteem, 
according to Dr. L^vinia 



Rodriquez, The bulimic 
fmally learns to control their 
weight through exercise and 
eating properly instead of 
vomiting. 

Anorexia usually begins as 
a harmless diet. A person's 
image of iheir own body 
becomes distorted and the 
victim becomes obsessed 
with losing weight or the fear 
of gaining weight even 
though they are very thin. 
The anorexic is driven by 
their passion for perfection. 
They will lose weight to 
control their own body and 
are driven to be perfect in 
their appearance. They are 
never perfect enough for 
their self-image, according 
to Avis Rumney, who was 
once anorexic. 



Recovery from ai 
a long but rewarding 

process. 11 involves a change 
of attitude towards weight, 
self-image and the people 
around them. They must 
learn good eating habits, and 
how to feel comfortable in 
social situations centered 
around food. They learn a 
new self -identity and in- 
crease their self-esteem. 

Treatments for these 
eating disorders are com- 
plicated but possible. It 
requires immediate help 
with a highly trained team of 
experts who can offer the 
emotionally supportive 
atmosphere needed to break 
tlie self-destructive cycle. 
For any further information 
call 425-3663.

Fort Wayne: Is there enough 
fan support for two pro teams? 



By GINA JONES 
Copy Editor 

The Fort Wayne Flames, 
an American Indoor Soccer 
Association expansion team, 
won its fourth game of the 
season Sunday. Nov, 30. The 
San Diego Ctucken was on 
hand to cheer the Flames to 
a victory 



Waves, Memphis Storm, and 

the Chicago Shoccers. 

When Cliff Brown was 
released the learn had a 
record of 2-3. Although Aliolo 
has been able to win 2 of his 3 
games as a player-coach, 
they were not fancy, or 
exciting wins. The Flames 
have 31 days, and 13 games 
until Ihey meet with the 



Commentary 



It sounds fairly decent that 
the Flames, only two months 
o1d,areableloa[ford tohave 
the San Diego Chicken on 
hand to cheer them to a 
victory. But don't be fooled. 
The crowd al the Memorial 
Coliseum was slated as 
being 1909. Thai's a far cry 
from the San Diego 
Chicken's usual crowd 
numbers Al the Fort Wayne 
Komels, he averages 7000- 
BOOO. Why thesmall number? 

Could it be thai the Flames 



just 



[1*1 



what 



professional team could be? 
Only 5 games into the season 
head coach. Cliff Brown was 
fired and replaced by Tom 
Aliolo, a player. They have a 
compiled record of 4-1. The 
only learn Ihey have been 
able to defeat is the Toledo 
Pride. The four losses were 
sound defeats. Beating the 
Flames were Tampa Bay 
Rowdies, the Milwaukee 



Toledo Pride again. Let's 
hope Ihey can find il in their 
numbers lo win againsi 
another team. 

If Ihey don't find them- 
selves able to beat a team 
other than the Pride, Ihey 
may ilnd themselves without 
a following. Which can mean 
an early death lo any 
professional team. 

Why should anyone sup- 
port the Flames? A learn 
that would fire its coach five 
games into its rookie season 
does sound like a very stable 
franchise. Consider the 
alternatives lo spending 15- 
S6 dollars on a ticket. You 
could go see a really 
professional team, the Fori 
Wayne Kernels. For tS.50, an 
IPFW student can get a 
middle arena seat, and 



'atch an 



leiling In- 



ternational Hockey League 
game lake place. The 
Komels may be having a 



Ujugh start this year, but 
consider that il is their 35th 
season They have 

weathered the storm. They 
have won the League 
championship six limes. 
They have some of the best 
players that the In- 
ternational Hockey League 
has seen in a long time. Jim 
Burton was the most 
valuable defensive player 
last season, and the coach, 
Robbie Laird, was the IHL 
coach of the year his rookie 
season, last year. With 
veteran players Dale 
Baldv/in, Ron Leef who is 
Ihird in the league in 
scoringi. Steve Salvueci, 
Tony Camazzola, and Derek 
Rav, the Komets show ex- 
perience that can lead a 
team to the lop of Ihe 
standings. 

The new players tor the 
Komels show great promise. 
The twins. Perry and Paul 
Pooley have proven to be a 
big asset with their scoring 
ability. Mike Lekun is third 
in the league with penalLes 
in minutes, and his style of 
rough-house hockey can turn 
the game in the Komels' 
direclion easily. 

So if you're looking for an 
exciting evening of 
professional entertainment 
go see the only professional 
team worth your money, the 
Fort Wayne Komels.
