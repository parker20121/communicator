APRIL 1, 1977 



Associate Vice-chancellor resigns 



"I just couldn't resign myself 
to Administration paper- 
pushing,' ' said former Assoc. 
V.C. J.E. Gilbert when asked the 
reasons for his recent resigna- 
tion. "I felt that I was not using 
my talents to best serve the 
interests of the university, the 
faculty, the students, or my fri- 
end, God." 

Gilbert declined to comment on 
specific instances involving ru- 
mored differences of opinion with 
his supervisors. However, he did 
offer a few insights into the 
general stimuli leading to his 
decision. "What they did to 
Kassover and Kamnikar was dis- 
gusting," he hypothesized. "They 
had this quota for tenuring 
faculty whose names began with 
K, which is entirely reasonable, 
but they provided only evasions 
when asked about negative ten- 
ure decisions." Gilbert added 
that he believes in forthcoming- 
ness, and that he is certain that if 
the quota system had been ex- 
plained to the faculty and stu- 
dents, all bad feeling would have 
been avoided. "It's keeping these 
things secret that are the real 
problem," the full professor of 



Psychology said. 

Asked about his future plans 
for the near future, the Assoc. 
Vice Chancellor said that he 
plans to return to his research: "1 
will enjoy doing research on real 
rats again," both in the labora- 
tory and the classroom. He siad 
that his religious beliefs had 
lipped the balance in his decision 
to leave administration and re- 
turn to teaching (research). He 
said that he was always under 
pressure to do the wrong thing, to 
base decisions on financial rather 
than Divine laws. "I had to do it 
for God's sake," said the former 
employee of the National Se- 
curity Agency. 

The father of one son and 
husband of one woman, Gilbert 
would not comment upon the 
search for his successor. "I just 
hope that the next Assoc. Vice 
Chancellor exhibits forthright- 
ness, humility, and a strong sense 
of personal integrity and morali- 
ty, because those qualities need 
more representation in an admi- 
nistration loaded with immoral 
megalomaniacs," siad the 47- 
year-old academician.

In support of her claim, she produced a photograph clearly showing one of the saucers inside a Campus

Indoor saucers fly with a hiss rather than the whoosh normally associated with outdoor saucers.

whether this is a humanistic or a scientific discovery . But I hope that Dr. Squadritq will publish the result*.

9.4% tuition increase announced 



Thatcher, 
Chancellor for Financial Affairs, 
released today a statement an- 
nouncing an expected 9.4 percent 

The increase will be effective 
for new students with the 1977 
summer sessions, and will be 



applied retroactively to the I 
ginning of all current students' 
studies. 

"It is not anticipated," That- 
cher's statement said, "that this 
increase will produce any 



Tenure system proposed at I.U.P.U.F.W. 



Last year less than half the 
graduating class of 1976 found 
jobs in the fields in which they 
received their degrees. The out- 
look for this year's class does not 
appear much better, and indica- 
tions are that in coming years 
the situation will only worsen. 
After they have worked diligently 
for four years we cannot even 
promise our young people a job. 
Thus, many find themselves do- 
ing work for which they are 
grossly over -qualified. What a 
national disgrace to find our 
sociology majors managing K- 
Marts, or worse yet, to discover 
that this generation's literati 
punctuate the CETA unemploy- 



tenure in which the cream of each 
year's crop is guaranteed per- 
manent economic security at the 
university they attend. By sup- 
porting these young adults in the 
schools we can keep them off he 
streets and out of the unemploy- 
ment line. This would reduce the 
ills we now suffer from unem- 
ployment, especially crime, men- 
tal illness, and book thefts from 
the library. The student tenure 
system would be modeled on the 
faculty tenure system which 
served us so well until its aban- 
donment here three years ago. 

For instance, only the bright- 
est, most creative and productive 
students would not be given 
tenure; I recognize the need for 
students and faculty to be able to 
relate to one another. From the 
remainder of the student body, a 
number of people, depending on 
the size of the school, would be 
offered assistant studentships. 
Certain procedures of the faculty 



system could be paralleled as in 
the case of the "publish and-or 
perish" rule. Students who wish 
to become tenured must submit 
at least three grammatical sen- 
tences before their graduation. 
These will then be sent on to the 
appropriate publication, such as 
Ripley's Believe-It-Or-Not or the 
Twayne Press. 

There is some fear among 
faculty and administration that 
eventually there would be a full 
tenured student body. Let me 
assure my peers that besides 
keeping a close watch on the 
number of students tenured each 
year, there could be purges every 
five years or so to thin the ranks. 
A required course from the 
Modern Foreign Language De- 
partment such as Slll-"Swahili 
for Accountants" would be held 
in the trom next to Safety and 
Security. Those successfully 
completing or surviving would be 
allowed to continue as before. 
Those wounded would be dis- 
missed following the presentation 
of The Silver Bullet for Safety 
Award. 

Another possible problem is the 
cost of financing such a worth- 
while endeavor. While money 
could come from the Student 
Activity Fund, many would re- 



sent the cutbacks this would 
involve to such high quality pro- 
grams as The Communicator, the 
Friday films, and women's 
sports. A better way, therefore, 
would be to garnishee 10 percent 
of the faculty's wages. In this 
way, we would get a chance to 
share the wealth and help support 
students, just as students now 
pay tuition to enjoy the benefits of 
a safe, secure faculty. 

The benefits of such a system 
are so obvious that I hardly need 
mention them. For instance, life- 
time security for students would 
be guaranteed. Nor more would 
these young minds have to face 
competition in the cold, cruel 
world. In most cases it would be 
advisable to reduce their course 
load to nine hours or less, giving 
them more time to pursue their 
work. Our young innovators will 
be able to use their spare time 
wiselyby working on Elementary 
Education projects, perhaps con- 
structing a wall-size collage for 
the Chancellor's Office, entitled 
"This Is My Country." 

Students entering the univer- 
sity will benefit from some posi- 
tive role models to which they 
can aspire. The university itself 
will have a core unit of model 
students to display to the com- 



munity and the bank. Faculty 
will be pleased to work with 
young minds created in their own 

Each tenured student would 
also enjoy some priviledges in 
addition to the already suggested 
responsibilities. They would get 
first place in line for registration, 
with no 101 classes to be taken. 
Each one would have his or her 
own parking space within a half- 
mile of the buildings.

poverished already, and that the 
main resull of the increase will lie 
to force them to take fewer credit 
hours each semester, prolonging 
the number of semesters needed 
toearn a degree." At present, the 
average student requires 13.72 
semesters to complete a four- 
year program at IFPW. 

"We feel sympathetic toward 
our students' needs," said Chan- 
cellor Schwartz, "but the State 
Legislature left us no alternative.

import English ivy and let it grow 
up the walls of the buildings. We 
think this will create a more col- 
legiate atmosphere and conse- 
quently will create more student 
involvement." 

Also under consideration is a 
plan to implant large plastic 
trees in the parking lots as 
markers. "We had originally had 
some suggestions concerning in- 
stalling numbered poles in the 
parking lots-like shopping cen- 
ters have-but we in student 
government decided that trees 
will be more picturesque. After 
all, this is a campus, not a 
shopping center, right?" 

As spring progresses and be- 
comes warmer, more benches 
will be placed around the campus 
for outside studying. "We de- 
cided to try a different kind of 



outside bench," said Smiller. 
"We have heard that the stone 
block type is not very comfor- 
table since they tend to stay cold 
no matter what the outside tem- 
perature, so we recruited the help 
of the Architectural Technology 
Department and had them design 
new benches for the campus, 
more comfortable than the stone 
ones, and less expensive. They've 
been working on it for the last 



from Roger's Mar- 
kets," mentioned Smiller. 

"We would like to encourage 
the students," he continued, "to 
contribute any ideas they would 
like to see implemented. We want 
to see more students involved in 
this campus and we think that by 
improving the outside appear- 
ance of the campus we will do 
that."

LETTER FROM THE PUBL ISHER-JOHN P. LAGGIN 



What SUBOG can do to alleviate student apathy 



Great Campus 
Pathetically, they have no other 
alternative to driving home after 
their classes. In addition to 
complaining about the drab col- 
lege life, these students also 
charge that they have difficulty 
finding a common place to meet 
and a common topic to discuss. In 
short, what they complain of is a 
lack of student organizations and 
activities to fill this void. 

I have been informed that an 
organization specially created to 
remedy this dilemma exists-the 
Student Union Board of gover- 
nors, known to insiders as 
SUBOG. Unfortunately they have 
had only a very limited success. 
This is such a pity because, as 
they declared during their cam- 
paigns for election, they are 
witling to do their utmost for this 
Great Campus. Undeniably, 
SUBOG members are deeply de- 
dicated to student concerns; it is 
just that they have not yet dis- 
covered a successful scheme. All 



SUBOG needs, they say, is an 
innovative program that will 
engage the interest of the stu- 
dents and give them a readily 



Now a friend of mine from Utah 









sr by electric 
chair, firing squad, or guillotine, 
generate a good deal of excite- 
ment. And what more likely 
targets than the self-sacrificing 
SUBOG members. They will have 
the opportunity to prove that they 
are truly giving everything they 
have for the benefit of this Great 
Campus. They can accomplish 
more by dying than by living. 

These executions will surely 
occupy the important role of pro- 
viding interesting, free enter- 
tainment. What student would 
dare drive home after her or his 
classes and miss such an occa- 
sion to socialize with fellow 
students and observe such an 
enthralling spectacle? Where can 
be found more excitement-at 
such low costs? Tlie positive ef- 
fects that this will have on th 



Student Body will be tremendous. 
No longer will students be at a 
loss for words when striking up a 
conversation with strangers. 
Weekly executions will be the 
topic of endless discussions. 

Even the families of the de- 
ceased SUBOG members will 
benefit from these executions. 
They will receive a full refund of 
their late relative's tuition pay- 

these days, will unquestionably 
make them independently weal- 
thy for life. 

The only problem I foresee is 
the imminent scarcity of SUBOG 
members once this program gets 
under full swing. However, this 
can be easily remedied by stag- 
ing SUBOG elections more fre- 
quently than the present yearly 
system. Obviously, this problem 
is far outweighed by the advan- 
tages, of which there are many. 

For first, it will give the 
students on this Great Campus a 
common topic of conversation 
and unite student interest, there- 
by fulfilling the original goal of 



SUBOG. These i 
certainly make SUBOG an or- 
ganization of the highest impor- 

Secondly, the absence of 
SUBOG members will save every 
student fifteen dollars. The acti- 
vity fee will not be required at 
registration time each semester 
because SUBOG members will 
not have an opportunity to spend 
it on projects they think best. 

Thirdly, it will save Indiana tax 
money. These SUBOG executions 
will substantially reduce the 
population on this Great Campus. 
thereby abolishing the necessity 
of constructing the additional 
classroom building under consi- 
deration by the administration. 

Fourthly, the absence of 
SUBOG members will eliminate 
the mimeographed SUBOG an- 
nouncements that deface every 
stairway in every building on this 
Great Campus. As far as anyone 
has yet determined, those un- 
sightly, cryptic announcements 
are just coded messages between 
SUBOG members. 



the 

Neff-l 



filmed highlights of 
be shown in 

Friday nights, instead 



of the dreadful SUBOG-chosen 
films. This will undoubtedly im- 
prove the quality of the Friday 
Night Films, if not diminish the 
violence of them. 

For these significant, sound 
reasons, I am confident that 
these executions will be an 
unqualified success. I expect the 
SUBOG members-if they were 
indeed sincere in their campaign 
promises of willing to make 
persona] sacrifices-will enthu- 
siastically embrace this propo- 
sal. I am sure they realize that 
something must be done to gene- 
rate excitement on this Great 
Campus. This crisis must not go 
unattended! Although there 
might be other solutions, I can 
think of no other plan that would 
getmaximum usage of SUBOG. I 
therefore humbly offer this solu- 
tion. I wish that I could do even 
more to serve my Campus, but, 
unfortunately, I was defeated in 
last month's SUBOG elections. 



STUDENT LINE FOR ACTION 



Student paper 'uninformative' 



Dear S.L.A. 

I feel that being a student at 
IPFW gives me a right to write 
you a letter telling you I think this 
paper needs help. It needs help 
because it doesn't provoke any 
enthusiasm. What we need is to 
get down to facts about what's 
going on here. This paper just 
sort of goes on and on about 
nothing. We students are the ones 
who support this paper, and I feel 
it is inadequate. We need more 
articles about what students want 
to hear about. The rights of the 
students here have been avoided 
too long. 

We don't want to hear garbage 
about who got appointed to what. 
We want to hear everything that 
goes on here that concerns us. I 
can't think of anything less in- 
formative than the things I read 
in our paper. So how about it.

Professional advisors are 
really 'pretty good guys' 

To the editor: 

I think it's high time we gave 
credit to our professional advi- 
sors. These people work for the 
benefit of all of us and deserve a 
lot of credit. They help us figure 
out which classes we should take 
and how many credit hours. I'm 
going to be a teacher and Dr. 
Gibbons has really been helpful 
in helping me figure out which 
electives to take in order to get by 
B.S. degree. I'm a senior and she 
helped me to understand that 
student teaching for Spring Stu- 
dent Teachers has to be taken 
either the first or second eight 
weeks of the Fall Semester, or if 
you're a Fall Student Teacher it 
has to be taken in the first or 
second eight weeks of the Fall 
Semester, unless you're taking 
Education M480 which is offered 
the second eight weeks of the Fall 
Semester for Fall Student Tea- 
chers and the first or second eight 
weeks of the Spring Semester for 
Spring Student Teachers. She 
also helped me to better under- 
stand all four phases of the 
ACTION program, and explained 
endorsements to me. I feel very 
strongly that these academic ad- 
visors do a lot to shape the 
professional people of the future.

trained for. Not only do they

spirit that made this country fa-

sense of nationalism upon which 
this country based? In this Bi- 
centennial time how could any- 
one perform such an unpatriotic 
and traitorous act. Not since the 
times of Benedict Arnold and 
Watergate have I been so en- 
raged. Remember the good old 
days of the militia, where men 

strung up by their thumbs? Those 
were the days when it really 
meant something to be free and 
an American. When everyone 
wore red, white, and blue, and 
crossed their hearts when they 
sang the National Anthem. When 
people took pride in their work, 
and worshipped God on his day. 
Those were the days that people 
would take up their arms and 
fight oppression for the good of 
the people, and to make the world 
safe for democracy.

True scope of 
Nepotism given 
in pseudo-fiction 

Review by BILL BRUENING 

The Geneology of Nepotism, by 
S. Bruening, Vanity &amp; Co., New 
York, $12.95. 

In this excellent pseudo-fiction 
by S.Bruening, the true scope of 
nepotism is, for the first time, 
presented to the public in a way 
which any person can under- 
stand. The Geneology of Nepo- 
tism describes with the depth of 
tomorrow, the foresight of today, 
and the transient existentialism 
of yesterday, the neverending 
battle for quality of personnel in 
colleges, universities, and indus- 
tries, and, of course, in the home. 

The concept of family em- 
ployees has been in turmoil for 
the last several weeks, and has 
now been totally clarified by S. 
Bruening. 

The concept of a familial small 
campus is used as paradigm by S. 
Bruening to show the world the 
practical applications of nepo- 
tism. "Imagine," she says, "one 
big, happy family of educators. 
Picture the continuum of edu- 
cational resources, the peaces of 
mind in the knowledge that one 
well-placed kiss could do it all for 
a student."

were reported to Safety and 
Security immediately after each 
student was found, Chancellor 
Schwartz commented. 'Take 
that Delaney girl," he said, 



"when a student found her there 
in the typing room, he got in 
touch with the S,S. within an 
hour. Now maybe the rest of 
them weren't reported with such 
quickness , but each of them were 
reported within a day or so." 

Chancellor Schwartz referred 
here to the death of Ellie Dela- 
ney, who died from the crushing 
blow of a falling typewriter. 
Police had said that she appa- 



typewriter while typing, and she 
hurled the machine at the wall, 
which rebounded it to her demise, 
Schwartz also talked about the 
student who last November had 
died while trying to find someone 
with a key to open a meeting 
room for him. "We don't know 
what to do with this one,'' 
Schwartz said, "he died from

Communicator named 'Best College Paper' 



The Communic 
left the International Collegiate 
Press Association with more 
awards and honorable mentions 
than any college publication in 
the complete world. 

The conference was held in 
Bippus, Indiana. Nearly half of 
the world's colleges sent entries. 

Categories judged included 
news, feature, sports and enter- 
tainment stories. Also under 
consideration were the areas of 
ad design, page layout and pic- 



sports story submitted to the 
Press Association this year, 
making the competition in the 
area less challenging. 

Honorable Mention was be- 
stowed on the Entertainment 
Section for the continuous Kiss 
reviews-for trying so hard. The 
judges were quoted as "seeing 
promise, perhaps some day they 



ly judged, the Communicator 
also picked up an honorable 
mention for headlines, with stan- 
dard classics such as "Students 
Irresponsible Pigs," and remark- 
able original ones like, "Good-

movie review. Last week's 



"Schwartz Should Resign" head- 
line was too late for this year's 
judging.

Another ad award received was

A First Place award was given 
to the best front page news story 
this year. The editors are proud 
to announce that the deserving 
story was the article about the 
giant carving of Johnny Apple- 
seed in Glenbrook. According to 
the editors it was one of the most 
thoroughly investigated stories of 



of a 
size of 

library and the number of 
holdings in it. The number of 
holdings available for research is 
an important factor for accredi- 
tation in the collegiate associa- 
tions. Since IPFW's library is 
generally known to have exten- 

' holdings and is considered

India: 



the 



md-place was awarded in 
a of sports, with the 



general survey was made this 
past week to determine what this 
fine reputation is based on. 

Upon entering the library, sev- 
eral holdings being used were 
observed immediately. A male 
and a female student were using 
the double clutch hold. This is not 
a highly visible holding, occuring 
as it did in only approximately 8 
percent of the students using the 
library. The single clutch was 
more in use. A full 55 percent 
were observed to holding at least 



ter study habits s 
often observed in the third and 
fourth floor carrels. One other 
hold seemed to have some popu- 
larity. It consisted of at least one 
finger in each ear. This was 
prevalent on the first floor in 
students trying to study near 
library offices. 

There are several different 
methods used in holding books or 
materials. One most prevalent 
was the arm crook. This entails 
holding one's arm across the 
body and inserting materials in 
the resulting holding area. An- 
other book holding method is the 
straight arm hold. Either the left 
or right arm and hand are held 
straight down at one's side and 
materials are held in the dang- 
ling hand. One variation is the 
double arm crook used mainly by 



hold. 



rity 



A different type of holding was 
also being used. A librarian was 
observed holding rather tightly to 
her desk while discussing re- 
search methods with a freshman 
lor grad student, it was hard to 
differentiate). The double clutch 
was seen being used erroneously 
by a security guard on a student 
leaving the building with un- 
checked books. The proper hold 
might have been a one-arm 
clutch. 

Director of Library Services 
Donald Grose told us, "We are 
very proud of the quality of our 
holdings and intend to maintain 
our present high standards. I 
have been to some of the finest 
research libraries in the country, 
and nowhere else have I witnes- 
sed such extensive holdings." 



Administration: Cause for alarm? 



Recent allegations that the 
administration at IPFW shows 
little concern for the students 
have brought about changes in 
policies concerning activities for 
students. According to Chancel- 
lor Schwartz, ' 'We care about our 
students!" 

- A Committee for Concern has 
been established, Schwartz said. 
Members will be chosen from 



concerned faculty, concerned 
students, and concerned staff. 

Schwartz hopes to see much 
publicity for the new committee 
and its work. "I have several 
suggestions," he said. One sug- 
gestion is to distribute buttons 
printed with the letters, "W.C.," 
which stands for "We Care." 

Another activity he hopes will 



become a reality is regularly 
scheduled fire alarms. Schwartz 
said he is aware that many 
students felt discriminated a- 
gainst because they were not on 
t have classes

larms disrupted 12:30 classes.

STUDENT LEAUGE OPINION POLL 



IPFW. Each of them had some 
input to give to this area. 

Among the suggestions to alle- 
viate the erowdedness was a plan 
for recruiting midgets who will 
take less space than the present 
students. The administrators 
were assured that this idea would 
be well-received because persons 
are accustomed to thinking small 
at IPFW 

Another administrator ques- 
tioned the need for constructing 
additional faculty office space. 
"Why don't they use their ears?" 
he said. He also mentioned the 
possibility of assigning ten fa- 
culty members to each office and 
letting "social Darwinism" take 
its course. But he said that he 
does not believe this will be 
necessary after the library is 
converted into faculty office 
space when the library holdings 
are stored in a closet. 

Another idea provided for 
scheduling one large English 
Comp class in the Memorial 
Coliseum. However, some admi- 
nistrators voiced concern that 
students might not attend classes 
in a building which is almost as 
far away as the Student Union 



Students ponder 4 Do gravel pits?' 



In our latest poll, we felt the 
need to disregard our editorial 
policy of low quality, slipshod 
journalism (and occasional 
smut) to raise the deep and 
philosophical question, "Do gra- 
vel pits?" 



Despite the complexities of the 
question, we were fortunate to 
gel at least one direct and simple 
answer from the many asked. 
Sieve Jenkins, a student of logic, 
stated confidently after several 
minutes of intense thought,

"Why, of course." 

The majority (some 48 percent 
of those polled) felt the question 
was too far above their powers of 
reasoning, and suggested that the 
question be put to the Student 
Government for consideration 
concerning whether or not gravel 
pits should become a campus 

12 percent felt that it being the 
gravel pits' business, and not 
theirs, that they would rather not 
get involved. 

Another 10 percent gestured 
either menacingly or obscenely 
when asked, and, appearing as if 
intelligent thought was too much 
to expect, were left alone. 

And nearly one third of those 
polled (35 percent) refused to 
answer either on grounds of self- 
incrimination, or because of 
pending charges of illicit traf- 
ficking in gravel pits and posses- 
sion of small amounts of gravel 
pits (two pounds or less). 

Utility bills to drop 

Only 43 students remain regis- 
tered after the March 15th drop 
deadline. 

CLASSIFIEDS 



Building: "Since the campus is 
expanding northward." argued 
one administrator, "the obvious 
solution is to annex the buildings 
in Canterbury Green." But this 
idea was discarded when they 
realized that students would ex- 
perience culture shock when put 
in an adequately heated class- 

They also suggested that to 
alleviate the crowded restrooms 
between classes, an alphabetical 
system should be arranged As 
one administrator said, "If they 
can't wait their turn, well... 
what's a river for?" 

Finally, one administrator re- 
vealed that the erowdedness is 
caused by students, "so why 
don't we just get rid of the 
students so we can have the 
campus all to ourselves?" 

Many administrators were 
skeptical that this could be 
accomplished. As one of them

curbed student fellowship by 
putting the Student Union Build- 
ing in the most inconvenient 
location on campus. Weonlyoffer 
the worst courses listed in the 
Bulletin." 

Suddenly one administrator got 
up and stated, "This erowded- 
ness problem is the students' 
problem, not ours. We're admi- 
nistrators! We don't have to cater 
to the whims of students. I 
suggest that we continue to pack 
'em in, and change Building D 
into a parking garage." 

This suggestion was enthu- 
siastically endorsed. The admi- 
nistrators promptly ended their 
meeting and flushed. 




Time Capsule unearthed 

Firepersons who were recently called to the Campus to inves- 
tigate the source of clouds of steam rising from the West wing of 
Kettler Hall were surprised to find that the steam was being 
released by a complex system of alarms installed when the Student 
Lounge was removed from Kettler and placed in a still-secret 



personnel to a time capsule earthed
