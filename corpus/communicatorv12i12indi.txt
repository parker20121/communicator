She finds career satisfying 



Taper has heart

BUSCHEY 

Some work with their hands, and 
some with their heads. Darla Taper 
also works with her heart. 

While Mental Health Technology is 
not for everyone, for Taper, who is 
studying to be a technologist, it is a 



rewarding and satisfying career op- 
portunity. 

Taper, a 1978 Elmhurst High School 
graduate, came to IPFW planning to 
major in sociology, but after hearing of 
the MHT program, decided to go first 
into the two year associate degree 
study and get her bachelor's degree 
later. 

Taper is also interested in learning 
more about the police academy 
training program, which could lead to a 
job as a probation officer. 

MHT is under the direction of Robert 
W. Hawley, associate professor, who 
talked about the concept of study at 
IPFW. 

The Purdue Associate Degree 
Program was developed in 1965 through 
a five-year National Institute of Mental 
Health Training Grant and has 
graduated over 300 technicians. 

The Fort Wayne program was the 
first of its kind anywhere in the world, 
and it has been the source of in- 
formation and study for many other 
pilot programs throughout the United 
States and Canada. 

"The Purdue program," Hawley 
said, "develops the "generalist," a 
person who is competent in helping 
people." Practicums required in the 
study allow the student to experience 
what is really happening and put the 
student in contact with the job she or he 
will be working with after graduation. 

For example, Taper's first practicum 
was spent at the Allen County Society 
for Crippled Children; her second was 
at Lakeside Middle School, where she 
helped children with home-life and 
study problems. Now she spends six 
hours a week at the Fort Wayne State 
Hospital and Training Center, helping 
people with maladjustive and behavior 
modification problems. "We try to 
develop good behavior in the individual 
and get rid of undesirable habits," 
Taper said. "I like it. It is really in- 
teresting." 

Taper's class, or group of students, 
has 19 women and men enrolled. This 
year's enrollment is 40, and the average 




age of the students is over 25. 

In addition to the practical ex- 
perience, students study basic courses 
in English, biology, psychology, 
sociology, therapy, and specialized 
classes which aid in personal growth 
and professional experience. 

One of the student requirements is to 
keep a journal. "It is a very personal 
and highly confidential recording of the 
individual's own feelings. It is a per- 
sonal commitment, essential to the 
student's growth and development," 
Hawley said. "The students evaluate 
their own progress and record how they 
feel about what they are doing." 

Taper became interested in social 
work in high school, and it influenced 
her involvement in the Student 
Exchange Program. She wanted to see 
what other countries were doing, and in 
1977, she spent five months in Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil, where she learned 
some Portuguese and observed the 
different customs and culture of South 
America. "The people are very close; 
they hug and kiss and touch," Taper 
explained. 

"I want to go back and see the family 
I lived with. They became a second 
family to me. Just talking about it 
brings back a lot of memories," she 
continued. "I've kept in touch through 
letters and phone calls. I'm saving my 
money so I can go back someday." 

She recalled that the treatment and 
care of Brazil's mentally disabled is 
similar to the care in the U.S. 

Taper hopes to further her education 
and would like to see a scholarship 
program set up for MHT students. 
"Most of the people in MHT go on to get 
higher degrees in either sociology or 
psychology. There are more openings 
at the lower levels, but like other jobs, 
the pay is better at the top," she said. 

Taper's busy schedule includes 14 
hours of credit course work and a part- 
time, 20-30 hours-a-week job as a 
waitress, which she says she loves 
because of the people. "It's not too 
bad," she said. "You get used to 
staying up." 



Placement tests are 
'blessing in disguise 9 



Service offers help for vets 



By SUE SNODGRASS 

For those U.S. veterans who thought 
it impossible to return to college, earn a 
degree and receive financial assistance 
for their services, fPFW's Student 
Services has an office that offers 
counseling and guidance. 

This new service has been available 
since September and is under the 
direction of Bob Wallace, service and 
guidance officer. 

Wallace, who replaced Steve Shieber 
in the position last week, is a Vietnam 
veteran currently enrolled in the VA 
program and majoring in supervision. 

Wallace worked for the VA Hospital 
in admitting and was in work-study 
under Denny Boester, veteran's 
benefits counselor, thus familiarizing 
Wallace with many of the problems that 
face veterans. 

While Boester is in charge of 
enrolling the returning veteran as a 
new student, Wallace provides coun- 
seling services and general information 
to assist the veteran in selecting the 
program he or she needs. He also 
provides services for the veteran 
already enrolled who encounters 
problems with benefits or studies. 



The veteran who wishes to earn a 
degree is eligible, for 10 years after 
military separation, to use 45 months of 
entitled money. Allowance rates are 
measured in terms of the number of 
dependents and number of hours taken. 

Disabled veterans are also allotted 
financial benefits for school, but are 
given a lesser amount because they 
also receive money for their 
disabilities. 

Disabled veterans also differ from 
the non-disabled veteran in the type of 
counseling they receive. The disabled 
veteran first receives main counseling 
in Indianapolis with vocational 
rehabilitation counselor Jeff Franklin. 
The veteran returns to the Fort Wayne 
campus and receives additional 
counseling with Wallace. 

An application is prepared and 
processed with all additional forms by 
Joan Churchill, a certifying official who 
prepares and processes all the 
paperwork for the entire VA program. 

This new counseling service is 
provided by a government grant 
allotted to the university through HEW. 
The money is entirely tax free and does 
not cancel the veteran's chance for 



applying for and receiving other types 
of financial aid. 

The only stipulations for receiving 
the VA benefits are that the vets must 
maintain at least a "C" average, and 
that they cannot switch majors or fields 
of study more than twice. 

Five hundred and fifty veterans are 
currently enrolled at IPFW. These 
veterans don't encounter too many 
problems except, perhaps, an oc- 
casional delay in payment, which is 
taken care of by either Churchill or 
Boester. 

' "No changes in the program will 
occur as a result of my filling the 
position," said Wallace. "With a new 
Congress wanting to cut back gover- 
nment spending, the BI-Bill may 
change, but a 5 percent increase in 
allowance will take effect in February 
of 1981. 1 think we have an outstanding 
program for the returning vet, and my 
job is to make people more aware of the 
benefits they can receive, and counsel 
the vet with any problems that he or she 
may encounter. I hope people will take 
advantage of such an opportunity." 



By DEBBIE 
CANTWELL 

Incoming freshmen may dread 
the English Placement Test, but 
IPFW professors and guidance 
counselors seem to view the 
mandatory examination as a 
blessing in disguise. 

Dave Jolliff, director of Coun- 
seling and Testing Service, said the 
lest places students in English 
classes appropriate to their skill 
level, and it also helps counselors in 
academic advising. Students are 
required to take the English test 
before enrolling in W100, W130, 
W131 or W140. 

Two years ago, the IU the Purdue 
faculty-senates mandated the test 
— along with the match placement 
test — for all incoming freshmen 
because of a wide disparity in 
composition skills. Before that time, 
the English department informally 
tested students. 

Is the test always accurate in 
placing students? 

"The placement tests measure 
achievement," said Jolliff. 
"Theoretically, the SAT (Scholastic 
Aptitude Test) is supposed to 
measure potential." 

The director said, "There is a 
common agreement no single lest is 
both valid and reliable." 

Although leaching assistant 
Peggy Yoder believes the test does 
a "fair" job in placement, she 
admitted, "I've had three or four 
people who needed help. I think the 
test tends to place people high. " 

Other instructors, however, are 
more satisfied with toe-results. 

Steve Hollander, one of the test's 
founding fathers who teaches an 
honors course this semester, called 
the results "super." He said 
i are easier to teach since 
program started." With 



classrooms containing students of 
equal abilities, there is no longer 
competition between the slower 
students and the more exceptional 
students, he said. 

Former acting director of com- 
position Lcland Person agreed with 
Hollander. The test does an "ex- 
cellent job," he said. "We take 
placement more seriously (here) 
than anywhere I've been." 

Ric Ramsey, present director of 
English composition at IPFW, said, 
"The tests tell us about the 
preparation of students who come 
here." Some of that clientele, he 
noted, are students returning to 
school whose writing skills may 
have become somewhat rusty over 
time. 

"Some schools use freshmen 
comp to weed people out," said 
Ramsey. "Wedon't do that." 

The composition test consists of 
106 multiple choice questions plus a 
written essay, both of which 
measure specific skills such as 
vocabulary, spelling and 
organization, 

All tests are hand-scored by 
several English professors, but that 
may be revised soon, said Ramsey. 

A $3029.20 proposal to get com- 
puter hardware installed on 
already-existing equipment was 
recently submitted to Edward 
Nicholson, vice chancellor and dean 
of faculty. If approved, data 
processing would change scoring 
and reporting procedures as well as 
store test results for research and 
administrative purposes. 

The results of the multiple choice 
section initially place students in 
either W130, a remedial course; 
Wl3l, elementary composition; or 
W140, an honors course. 

But the written essays, Ramsey 
said, often make the difference in 
class placement for those students 



whose test scores are borderline. 

Of the 3,554 students who took the 
test the past (wo semesters, 52 
percent placed into WI30, 45 percent 
Into WI31, and three percent into 
WI40. 

Most professors would agree the 
percentages are less than ex- 
ceptional. 

Ramsey believes IPFW could 
slienglhen Ms composition program 
if all classes were tauglil five days a 
week, and If smaller classes were 
the rule, not the exception. IPFW's 
class sizes, he added, arc "better 
than some schools, but not al all 
ideal." 

Classes may In fact shrink or 
expand during the first two weeks of 
the semester. Students may be "re- 
placed" during the first two weeks 
of the semester, if instructors 
believe they have been "misplaced" 
hy the test. The decision to move, 
however, is left lo the student. 

All In all. Ihe English Placement 
Test has proven to be a blessing for 
instructors. The students, however, 
think differentlv. 

"Most students fear the test," 
said Shirley Olwein, secretary of 
counseling and testing services. 
"There is no such thing as flunking 
this lest. It just puts you in the right 
level," 

Apprehensive students often ask 
Olwein how they can sludy for the 
lest Her answer is always the 
same. "There's no way to study 
really, I tell them, 'It's just a sur- 
prise. When you come, you'll find 
out,"' 

The next test date Is Dec. 13, at 
B:30 a.m., in the Watb Memorial 
Union Ballroom. Students should 
contact the Office o( Counseling and 
Testing Services — Room 113, Walb 
Memorial Union — for more in- 
formation. 



IPFL places at annual meet 



Three members of the IPFW 
Forensic League, competing in their 
first speech event, were among the top 
winners in Ball State University's 12lh 
annual speech tournament. 

The two-day event, entitled "Age of 
Aquarius," was on Nov. 7 and 8. with 
more than 200 students from 20 schools 
across the Midwest participating, said 



Janet Roncelli, IPFL faculty advisor. 

"Our team members were more than 
prepared for the competition," Roncelli 
said. Each of those who placed in the 
contest had to present his or her speech 
or reading four times— three times in 
the preliminary rounds and then again 
in the finals against the best from the 
earlier rounds. 



The highest placing IPFL member 
was Pat Sehoenrade, who earned 1st 
place in Novice Persunsion. Lynda 
Hatfield was 3rd in After-Dinner 
Speaking, and David Yarnelle placed 
6th in Dramatic Interpretation. 

IPFW placed 6th in the sweepstakes 
competition. 



Senate meets, acts 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

Three new bills, one resolution, 
newly-elected senators and several 
appointments were on the Students' 
Senate agenda for Nov. Sand 12. 

During the Nov. 5 meeting, the Senate 
voted to make permanent the seats held 
t&gt;y students from the Department of 
General and Technical Studies and the 
Department of Fine Arts, thus allowing 
any vacant seats held by those mem- 
bers lo remain open until they could be 
filled by students from those depart- 
ments. 

Approved at the Nov. 12 meeting was 
q bill permitting freshmen to run for 
Students' Senate seats. 
- Also passed was a bill allocating $200 
from (he Students' Government office 
account to fund a coupon book that will 
be distributed lo members of the IPFW 
student body during the spring, 1981 
semester. 

These coupons will provide discounts 
at various restaurants in the Fort 
Wayne area, 

Resolution N was passed urging the 
Class Scheduling Committee to arrange 
a longer lunch break between Saturday 
morning and alurnoon classes, ll was 



requested that ARA Food Services 
provide grill service during the 
Saturday lunch hours. 

Also at the meetings, Mark Wells was 
elected President Pro-tem and Ken 
Schenk was sleeted Sergeant at Arms of 
the Students' Senate. 

Matt Hall, Rhonda Stringfellow and 
Roger Meriwether were accepted as 
new senators during the Nov. 5 
meeting Hall was assigned to the 
Student Affairs Committee, and 
Meriwether was assigned to the 
Legislative Affairs Committee. 

Some presidential and vice- 
presidential appointments were also 
made. Bob Griebel was accepted as 
Constitution Ad-Hoc, Michael Edmonds 
was named Student Affairs Chair- 
person and Gedalyhu Ben-Shimeon was 
accepted as Legislative Affairs 
Chairperson. Griebel and Ellen 
Engleman were assigned to the 
Legislative Affairs Committee, and 
Mark Wells was assigned to Ihe Student 
Affairs Committee. 

In other action during Ihe Nov. 5 
meeting, the University Friends of 
'Animals' constitution was approved. 




Faculty ratifies merger 



Members of Indiana and Purdue 
universities faculties here have ratified 
a constitution that replaces their 
separate faculty senates with a joint 
senate. 

I.U. faculty members voted 104-5 to 
approve the new constitution, while the 
Purdue faculty favored the agreement 
with an 84-14 vote. 

The new constitution, which outlines 
the establishment, composition and 
powers of the new combined senate, 



will now be submitted to the presidents 
and boards of trustees of both I.U and 
Purdue for final approval. 

Among Ihe powers of the faculty 
senate are determining policies 
regarding faculty tenure and 
promotion, student conduct and ad- 
mission of students. 

The faculty senate also determines 
the academic calendar and sets policies 
for class scheduling and student par- 
ticipation in athletic affairs.

Thanksgiving Day. 

It's a day set aside— first by our forefathers

It is a lime when we pause to reassess what

Bolh life and a bag of 
candies also contain great 
surprises. It's not every lime 
we stick our hands in the bag 
that we retrieve a sourball. 
No, many times we are 
pleased to withdraw a jelly- 
(illed import from Holland or 
France. We tasle the sweel 
juices of life like we savor 
the sweetness of such can- 
dies. And for some time after 
having such a wonderful 
pleasantry, the sweetness 
lingers and the emotions 
soar. 

We are thrilled and 
exhilirated by the rewards in 
life— rewards we have 
strived for and taken risks to

Will we be haunted by the

tempted by the contents of

bad with the good and the 
failure with the success. We

These unusual sculptures by Ha Seltzer, constructed mostly from fabric and glue, are o 
display In Artlink 's large gallery. ( Photo by Holdcn Maecker. ) 



Dance, slides featured 



Exhibit opens 



The latest exhibit to open 
at Artlink offers the 
sculptures of Ila Seltzer, an 
artist from Madison, 
Wisconsin. 

Constructed mostly from 
fabric and glue, each work is 
generally a series of 
repeated patterns that range 
in size from small wall 
hangings to a large floor 
piece that covers much of 
the back of the gallery. 

Her use of colors adds 
dimension to her work; 
several of the pieces are 
dyed and one. "Silver 
Lining," has painted ridges 
which accent the texture and 
the outline of the fabric. 

Featured at the opening 
last Friday was the 
premiere performance of 
"Sundrop," a dance based 
on Japanese culture and 
presented by the Fort Wayne 



Dance Collective Touring 
Group. 

The group consisted of 
four women, and their 
performances were graceful 
and poised. They moved well 
to the music, which was 
lovely in and of itself. 

Although the chor- 
eography was some- 
times corny and other 
times bizarre, the overall 
effect was a beautiful dance 
that flowed smoothly. 

Following the dance, 
Seltzer gave a gallery talk 
about her work that featured 
slides from her various, 
exhibits. 

The slides were a 
fascinating chronicle of her 
progression from heavy 
wooden sculptures to lighter 
pieces featuring 

cheesecloth. She also in- 
cluded slides of works from 
her current display which 
helped show where the 
works fit into her artistic 
development. 



Her discussion was also an 
enjoyable enhancement to 
the slide show. She was 
thorough without being too 
detailed or verbose, and her 
thoughts added much to the 
intrigue of her art. 

Seltzer's sculptures will 
remain on exhibit at Artlink 
through December 9.

At First Presbyterian Theater 

Show views love 



By HELEN BUSCHEV 

What is love? Oh pray thee 
tell. It is that fountain, and 
that well, where pleasure 
and repentance dwell. 

This question and others 
like it are contemplated in 
Terry Hand's "Pleasure and 
Repentance," which opened 
this weekend at First 
Presbyterian Theater, under 
the direction of John Tolley. 

"Pleasure i Repentance" 
Is a relaxing two hours of 
poetry and song, a "light- 
hearted look at love," per- 
formed by four readers and a 
balladeer. 

The readers. Otto 
Bonahoom, DonEtte Harold, 
Marsha Wallace and David 
Yarnelle, describe love from 
the early childhood writings 
of Margory Fleming, 



through the words of many 
other familiar writers. 

The performance, in two 
parts, goes from young love 
and courtship, into marriage 
and disillusionment, and 
ends with a section, "Last 
Confessions," where we hear 
George Bernard Shaw's 
especially vivid remem- 
brances about his mother. 

The audience found en- 
joyment and laughter in the 
many quips and jokes woven 
throughout, such as the 
father advising his son on 
marriage and saying, "It's 
time to take a wife." "But 
father, whose wife shall I 
take?" 

Or consider one man 
asking the other, "Do you 
talk to your wife after you 
make love?" "Only if there 



is a phone handy," the other 
jokingly replies. 

The performers were 
excellent in their portrayal 
of the various characters 
that wind in and out nf the 
readings. Bonahoom earns 
applause for his quick and 
precise "said he" and "said 
she" in E.E. Cummings, 
"May I feel said he." Mary 
Collins should also be noted 
for a lovely voice and talent 
as the balladeer. 

So what is love? It is a yea, 
it is a nay ... take advantage 
while you may. 

Others may take ad- 
vantage of the final three 
performances to be given 
this weekend, Nov. 21and22, 
at B p.m., and on Sunday, 
Nov. 23 at 2 p.m. Student 
tickets are $2 and adults can 
get infor $3.50. 



Police sound fresh 



By SUE 
SNODGRASS 

While imitation new wave, 
like Cher's Black Rose, has 
contaminated the taste of the 
majority with com- 
mercialized has beens. the 
Police have made another 
oustanding effort In 
providing true punk for those 
who wish to choose. 

Once again, the Police 
have superbly presented 
their style of jazz and reggae 
slickness with their clean 
drive of punk; the same 
freshness that made their 
1977 hit, "Roxanne," a 
success, 

Their new LP, "Zenyatta 
Mondatta," is their best due 
to a world tour. 

The album's title is 
derived from a 

conglomerate of symbols. 



Zenyatta is derived from the 
words Zen, a philosophy, and 
Jomo Kenyatla, an African 
politician. Mondatta is 
descended from the French 
word for Sanscrit and 
combined with the Reggatta, 
part of the title from the 
group's second LP. 

The LP was recorded in 
three weeks in the 
Netherlands, and directly 
reflects what the group saw 
and experienced on their 
tour. 

The son, "Driven to 
Tears" is about world 
hunger and poverty. With 
lyrics like, "I hide my face in 
my hand, shame grows in 
my throat; my comfortable 
existence is reduced to a 
shadowless, meaningless 
note; seems like when some 
innocent die, all we can offer 



them is a page in some 
magazine; too many photos 
and not enough food," the 
band's concern for social 
issues is proven. 

Perhaps the most im- 
pressive cut is "Bombs 
Away." which reflects on the 
political and military 
hypocricy In Bombay.. 
Stewart Copeland provides 
skaish funk to words such as, 
"The president speaks; his 
shirts are clean but his 
country reeks; bombs away, 
but we're okay." 

The entire album is a 
social statement that makes 
one question one's own 
existence. The music Is 
exciting and distinguished, 
and it makes the Police, an 
underground band from the 
early movement, the most 
prominent group of 
musicians of the decade.

Coming This Christmas 



Cagers to open season 



PAGE 6— THE COMMUNICATOR — NOVEMBER 20,1980 



ByMIKEFRANKE 

This year's edition o( 
Indiana-Purdue basketball 
goes into the season with 
some question marks, but 
there is one intangible this 
season Ihal was lacking in' 
last year's campaign. The 
team has found a basketball 
"family togetherness." with 
everyone pulling in the same 
direction. 

This is an important 
aspect thai was missing 
from last season's 4-20 team. 
Ken Workman, starting his 
second season as head 
coach, feels that the 
•■togetherness" will result in 
a definitely improved 
ballclub. 

Workman has four 
returning lettermen three 
transfers, and four freshmen 
recruits from which to mold 
his team. 



One problem thai Work- 
man had with last year's 
team was the lack or an 
Intimidating center. 

Although he wasn't able to 
recruit any big centers for 
this season, he does have one 
player who should fill the 
void when the season opens 
Friday night in the Cedar- 
villc Invitational. 

Greg, Stillwell. a 6'6" 
senior, returns for his final 
year after a rugged off- 
season workout schedule, 
which will undoublably 
mean a big improvement in 
the pivot area. 

Junior Brian Grady 
returns to the team after a 
one year layoff Two years 
ago, Grady averaged 9.6 
points per game. 

Reluming to Fort ,7ayne 
after a junior college stint in 
South Dakota, are Rickie 



Smith and Gregory Hunter, 
both of whom played at 
South Side High School. 
Smith, a 6'3" skywalker, will 
help the front-court situation 
with good shooting and 
aggressive rebounding. 
Hunter will be used at guard. 

Junior Ron Bojrab, an 
excellent perimeter shooter, 
will be counted on to do some 
big scoring this season for 
the Tusker squad. 

Another transfer is Tony 
Davis, a 6 foot sophomore 
point guard from Bishop 
Dwcnger. Davis will 
probably* be one of the 
starting guards in Friday 
night's opener. He attended 
St. Francis in his freshman 
year. 

Sophomore Craig Wort and 
junior Mark Potty will also 
see some action at the guard 
spots. 



Second state title 
eludes v-ball team 



B&gt; CHRIS PYLE 

The women's volleyball 
team fell short in its bid to 
defend its state title as it 
advanced lo the quar- 
terfinals before being ousted 
by the eventual state 
champs, Taylor University. 

"We were naturally 
disappointed," coach Peggy 
Voisin said about (he Tusker 
losses in the tourney, "but 
we did gel out of our pool and 
into the quarterfinals." 

"The girls have nothing to 
be ashamed of," Voisin said. 
"We suffered injury after 
Injury after injury, but the 
kids never gave up." 

The reference to the 
numerous injuries plaguing 
the team emphasizes the 
unfortunate happening that 
occurred in the Tusker loss 
to Taylor. 



"We lost the first game 8- 
15," Voisin said, "so I told 
the girls at the break 'You 
gotta do it now ' They came 
out and just stomped 'em 
(Taylor) in the second game, 
and we were leading by three 
points in the third." 

Freshman Lori Gray 
described what happened 
next. "We were ahead and 
Mary Drake ran for the ball. 
She collided with Amy 
Brunow and she {Drake! 
passed out from the collision. 
Mary really scared us. She 
wasn't breathing and she 
turned a blue-purplish color. 
Coach Voisin wos ready to 
give her mouth-to-moulh 
resuscitation. Then Mary 
started gasping (or air. We 
were relieved when she was 
able to walk off the court." 

The spikers were relieved 



but also rattled. They lost 
their concentration, and the 
momentum passed to 
Taylor, who won the game, 
15-6, and the match, 

In the previous match, the 
Tuskers avenged an earlier 
season loss lo St. Marys by 
thumping them in two 
straight games, 15-4 and 15- 
13. 

In the opening round of the 
tourney, the Tuskers played 
Anderson College Friday 
afternoon. Anderson took 
them by surprise and beat 
them in two straight games, 
15-8 and 15-8. 

"We really weren't up lo 
playing them," Gray 
commented. "We were 
waiting for the match 
against SI. Mary's." 

The women's volleyball 
team ended the season with a 
14-26seasonrecord. 



Walk-on Mike Schaefer 
will use his 6'4" frame to 
give some aggressive play in 
the middle. 

The four freshmen recruits 
are led by 6'2" Gary Rinard. 
The Eastslde High School 
graduate could be in the 
starting lineup in Cedarville. 
Olher freshmen recruits 
include Kendall Murphy, 
Scott Norris and Phil 
Sh idler. 

The freshmen become 
even more Important this 
season because of the ab- 
sence of two key players 
from Ihe 79-80 season, 
Clifford Todd, last season's 
leading scorer, has decided 
not to come back this season, 
and ptaymaker Wyan Dunn 
left the school in the fall and 
has nol returned. 

In this the final year at the 
rented Concordia Seminary 
Gym, prior to (he move to 
the new on campus facility in 
1981, the Tuskers will have 
some problems on the court. 
However, there is great 
improvement from last 
year's squad. 

The major problem is lack 
of size, but Workman sees a 
way to minimize the 
problem "If you're 
aggressive and heady, and 



have the desire, you can do a 
lot of things lo overcome 
size, or the lack of it." Work- 
man does see some definite 
positive aspects that the 
team lacked last year. The 
coach said, "We'll have 
much better scoring 
balance, along with greater 
floor savvy." 

In Friday night's action, 
Ihe Tusker's will play 
Cedarville in the second 
game of the evening. Kenyon 
College plays in the opener. 

The Tusker's first home 
game comes next Tuesday 
evening, as Ihey "host" 
Concordia College at the 
Concordia gym. Game time 
is 7:30. 

Workman is hoping that 
the team establishes its new 
"family togetherness" 
starting with this weekend's 
games. The feeling is that 
the new attitude will cut 
down on the many mental 
errors that plagued last 
season's team. 

Getting the team to play 
aggressively is the key to the 
season, according to Work- 
man. "When the 
aggressiveness becomes 
built in, then we'll have what 
it takes to play most of the 
teams on our schedule." 



Why do they do it? 



ByCllRlSPYLE 

There are some students at 
IPFW who spend long hours 
practicing, doing their 
homework and studying in 
vans and cars, gel home lale 
al night, and have to be back 
a( school early the next day 
for classes. In return, they 
reieive little fame and no 
fortune. 

That is the plight of the 
sludenl-athlele ot IPFW. 
The women's volleyball 
team recently completed its 
season, and some of the 
members gave their reasons 
as why they put up with it. 

"I love volleyball." said 
freshman Lori Gray. 
"Volleyball lakes a great 
deal of time, dedication, 
work and pain." 

Junior captain Jo Witte 
likened Ihe relationships that 
develop belween the 
members as those of a close 
knit family She also liked 
the challenge the sport 
presents 



"Nancy Rorick is always 
getting her fingers 
smashed," Gray said about 
her fellow team member. 
"Never an ankle, always her 
fingers. Nancy has the 
winning spirit. She helps 
keep the team together. Our 
captains, Kim Heimann and 
Jo Witte, kept the learn up 
with their positive attitudes. 
We had two girls, Laura 
Franke and Cindy Frisby, 
who never played on a 
volleyball team before. 
They've come a long way 
since Ihe beginning of the 
season. H's really amazing." 

Other members of the 
volleyball family were Sue 
Hendricks, Linda 

Przeniczny, Sarah Uhrlck, 
Amy Brunow, Mary Drake, 
Beih Christman, Janet 
Braun and learn manager, 
Peggy Link. 

Head coach Peggy Voisin 
also received high praise 
from Gray. "Peggy made 



the team fun. A coach has to 
be supportive but corrective, 
even in hard times. She 
rubbed off an 'I wont to win' 
attitude. I fell bad we didn't 
win the state title for her. I 
know it meant a lot to her, 
bul I don't think she was 
disappointed in us. Peggy 
made a darn good coach," 
Gray said. 

Now that the season is 
over, the family must break 
up and go its separate ways. 
However, some of the girls 
will not be completely 
separated, as it is expected 
that five or six of them will 
join the women's basketball 
team. 

"I'm going to miss the 
girls that leave, but I look 
forward to a new season and 
meeting new friends," said 
Gray. 

"I don't know what I'm 
going to do with my extra 
time now that volleyball 
season is over," said 
Heimann.
