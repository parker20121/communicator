College Access Channel 6 brings 
classroom to area living rooms 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Reporter 



No longer is an education Oiffi- 
culi to obtain. Such setbacks as 
irans portal! on, child day-care and 
afrordabiliiy are now becoming 
problems of the pasl. Presently, a 
simple lap on the power button of 
a remote coniroljer can open ihc 
doors to a wide range o( knowl- 
edge 

On our campus, College Access 
Channel 6 offers such programs 
(hat reach an esiimaied 75,000 
bousebolds These programs, 
aimed lo enrich, leacb sign lan- 
guage, science, malh. art. numer- 
ous ron:ign languages, along wiib 
many other such general study 
courses Each show is meant to be 
equivalent to a standard college 
lecture 

"Out intention is lo use televi- 
sion media to gel college courses 
to people who can't make it to col- 
lege campuses," said program 
director Bemic Lohmuller "With 
broadcast television, we can reach 



most of Ihem." 

Channel 6 uses the television 
studio facilities located in the 
basement of the Helmke Library. 
llie station offers a combination 
of locally produced and acquired 
educauona! progrums. College stu- 
dents are strongly encouraged to 
use Uie channel by collaborating 
on the programs dial are televised 
Regardless of the field of study, 
students are welcome to partici- 
pate in tbe many different areas, 
including audio, taping, lighting 
and m from of die camera. 

"We operate the channel like 
any other television station, except 
we don't have news," said 
Lohmuller 

When deciding which programs 
should be aired, the director and 
staff take many things into consid- 
eration They Hrsi look at the mar- 
ketplace of the entire county. 
Viewers range from black to 
while, along with vanous national- 
ities This is the main reason why 
so many foreign language pro- 
grams are aired and well-received. 
Languages currendy being shown 



are Spanish, German. French, 
Russian and Japanese. Tbe staff 
tries not to duplicate other pro- 
grams, for large gaps of coverage 
are desired 

Channel 6 is also the only cur- 
rent source of televised entertain- 
ment for Ibe local Ladno commu- 
niiy Comcast Cablevision. the 
company that offers Channel 6, 
has been criticized for not extend- 
ing Univision to 24-hours a day. 
Univision broadcasts when 
Channel 6 signs off. always lale m 
die evening, past die bedtimes of 
many potential viewers. 

The cast of characters needed 
to successfully run the channel are 
many. When that cast is not full, 
complications arise 

Many students are needed to 
do behind-the-scenes work 
Contractors are needed for set 
design Writers are needed to pro- 
duce dialogue. And students are 
needed to fill lighting and sound 
positions.

Time is ticking away toward die 
opening of tbe XXVI Olympiad to 
be beld In Atlanta, Ga . and Ibe 
United States national volleyball 
team is pruned for tbe compeution 
With a litUe over a month remain- 
ing before the start of the Olympic 
games, tbe team is settled into a 
scheduled training routine and 
arrived in Fort Wayne ready to dis- 
play Its talent 

The tnp is a chance for the team 
to emulate the schedule they will 
likely keep during Uie Olympics 
while allowing them to get accus- 
tomed to playing in front of a large, 
fnendly crowd 

"We haven't played at home m 
front of a big crowd." Bryan Ivie, a 
veteran of the 1992 Olympics said, 
"We've always played on the 
road." 

Playing for the citizens of tbe 
United Stales on their own home 
turf is'one reason Ivie and his icam- 
tnaies feel die need to be very com- 
petitive in Atlanta Although the 
team isn't expected lo win a medal. 
Ibis is one group of men that 
believes they are quiie capable of 
surprismg some teams. Team USA 
feels diere is a lot to show the rest 
of the world, especially since the 



games arc being played on 
American sod. 

It will not be an easy task bow- 
ever. One of the reasons for the 
team coming to Fort Wayne was to 
tune up for tbe Olympics and to 
play against formidable compeli- 
Qon The US National Team will 
face die French Nauonal Team in a 
pair of matches at Memorial 
Coliseum this weekend Although 
the French did not qualify for tbe 
volleyball tournament at Ihe 
Olympics, they are a team full of 
vigor and fight and have come to 
give tbe American team a real fight 

Team France is young. Il is how- 
ever, a team headed in Ihe right 
direction Having competed well 
and defeated some of the other 
nations that will compete in 
Atlanta, the French fully expect to 
be a force on the international scene 
m years to come, 

'"We need some good competi- 
Qon." USA coach Fred Sturm said 
"1 Uiink this is going to be a firsi- 
class experience. It will be fabulous 
for bolb learns " 

The matches at memorial 
Coliseum will give the teams Ibe 
opponunity to play in an Olympic 
atmosphere The Omni in Atlanta 
will most likely be packed to ibe 
rafters with spectators Previous 
pre-Olympic matches have drawn 
an average crowd of about 3.1X10 to 



4.000 spectators and the IPFW 
Adiletics staff hopes to have at least 
that many spectators turn out ibis 
weekend. 

Good tickets are still available 
for both Friday and Saturday night 
at all TickeiMasier outlets The 
matches begin at 7:30 pjn ; tickets 
are S7 and $9 per session 

It's becoming crunch lime for 
Team USA and with a roster dead- 
line of June 19, Sturm has to Ihm 
Ihe rosier down to 12 players from 
die current 15 players. This week- 
end's matches are one of die last 
chances he will be able to see his 
learn compete before making those 
cuts Sturm is hoping die caliber of 
the competition, as well as the 
atmosphere diis weekend, will draw 
extra effort out of die team 

"We have some things that need 
to be worked out in competition, " 
Sturm said "We are going at this 
like It is a big challenge Tbe play- 
ers see that Ibe end is near and I 
think that's bringing out a little 
somethmg extra in everybody," 

Ivie agrees and hinted at the pos- 
sibdity thai Ihe U S may surprise a 
lot of people in Atlanta, 

"Obviously we are not tbe 
favored team in Atlanta." Ivie said, 
"But diis team is more atbleac than 
in tbe past We are young, but I 
think we certainly can compete, I 
think we can win "

by Richard Flesher 
News Reporter 

Colleagues and students of 
Linda Fox knew a day would come 
when she'd be honored That day 
has come. 

Fox. assistant professor of

ter's degree at Indiana 
University at Bloomington 
and her Ph D from the 
University of Wisconsin 
She landed at IPFW in 
1971 and helped form and

"Teaching goes beyond 
tbe classroom and 
women's issues are some- 
thing of greai interest to 
me. " says Fox Herdcdicauon goes 
beyond the classroom to include 
supervising student tethers, guid- 
ing students to Multicultural 
Services, directing student inde- 
pendent research projects and 
supervising miemships of Spanish 
Students working at local agencies. 

Her course evaluations in tbe 
pas I have shown an overwhelming 



majonty of her students 

give her high marks for 
her teaching abilities. 
Fox credits her enthusi- 
asm for this perfor- 
mance But her col- 
leagues give her high 
points as well. 

"I think it's great 
she got it It's very 
well-deserved." says 
Jeanetie Clausen. Chair 
of modem foreign lan- 
guages "Her students 
all wnie in and say she got them to 
do things diey never thought they 
could, and that's what it's all 
about." 

Fox has been recagni7£d for ber 
teaching in the past. In 1994, she 
was voted outstanding teacher for 
Indiana University by die Indiana 
University Student As.sociation

Shopping for Dad has never been so easy! 




So wbal did you gel Ihc old 
man ' 

Come on. ouc with it. Another 
cheap tie from Value City? The 
same hammer you bought him al 
Sears three years ago? A mem- 
bership with the Hair Club for 
Men? Or does it come as a ciim- 
pleic surprise to hear thai 
Father's Day is this Sunday? 

As we all know, the idea 
behind Father's Day began in 
1905 when a young writer by the 
name of Fran/ KalVa was grow- 
ing up in the hear! of downtown 
Vcincrschniizel. Germany Kalka 
wrote children books to help pay 
for his schooling at the 
Universiiy of Dcr Fuschnikcns, 
Franz's father was an insomniac. 
so Fran? though! he would use 
his skills as a wnier lo compose 
a book which could aid his father 
in attaining a decent night's 
sleep K^flta's manuscript was a 
chronicle of a very small bug — 
by the name of Van VIetk from 
the County of Kleck — who 
sought a siesta Franz's writing 
style was one that would later 
become distinguished from his 
colleagues: 

"A moose is asleep He is 
dreaming of moose drinks A 
goose is asleep. He is dreammg 
of goose dnnks That's well and 
good when a moose dreams of 
moose juice And nothing goes 
wrong when a goose dreams of 
goose juice. But it isn't too good 
when a moose and a goose sian 
dreaming they're drinking the 



other one's juice. 
Moose juice, not 
goose juice, is 
juice for a moose, 
and goose juice. 
not moose juice, 
coil IS juice for a 

hman ^oose ■ 

Kafka s com- 
position, sadly 
enough, disap- 
peared one 
evening as he 
was baby-sitting 
the infant Teddy 
Geisel, who was visiting the 
country with his family. 
(Strangely enough, a similar 
publication appeared 57 years 
later, titled the "Sleep Book." by 
that very same Thcodor Seuss 
Geisel.) it was the third Sunday 
in June thai the book vanishe-J, 
and KafVa marked the tragedy by 
giving bis father an ugly necktie 
he purchased from an upstart 
department store in downtown 
Veinerschnilzel called Der Value 
Ciiy The tradition has continued 
until this day. and we still cele- 
brate the third Sunday in June by 
swapping sententious strangle- 
strings. 

Not all sons or daughters can 
afford those S60 Italian Silk 
neckties, and some even like the 
idea of being creative and buying 
something else for Dad (although 
that really makes the rest of us 
look bad) So. for the last-minute 
ihnft shopper, here is a compila- 
tion of gift ideas for Pa: 

• 1997 Porsche 929 (jet 
BLACK). Okay, so it isn't the 

MOST ETtUGAL FATHER'S DaY GIFT. 

But heck. I'm pretty sure it 

WOULD TOP the list OF THINGS 

he'd like. 

• 1984 Honda Civic hatch- 
back (RUSTY BROWN). THIS ONE'S 
A BIT MORE ECONOMICAL THAN 

THE Porsche, And I'll trade 
YOU straight up for next 
year's TiimoN. 

• A Date WITH Cindy 
Crawford Might wast to 



RESERVE THIS IDEA fOR SINGLE 
DADS OF THE WORLD, UNLESS YOU 
HAVE A DESIRE TO GO SEARCHING 

FOR Antonio Banderas next 
MoniER's Day. 

• Cooking lessons A good 

NUMBER OF DADS ARE LACKING IN' 
CULINARY EXPERTISE, ThE 

Swedish Chef from the 
"muppets" might be a good 
guy to hook him lp with. 
Better hire a translator too. 

• The Irritable Bowel 
Syndrome and 
Gastrointestinal Solutions 
Handbook, Hey, it's only 
s12.95 plus s3 postage and 
handling. If you aren't satis- 
fied YOU CAN RETT.HN THE BOOK 

WITHIN 30 days for a refund. 
Give me a call if you seed the 
address, 

• Here's a great new prod- 
uct: ChiaDad. Even better 
THAN the Haik Club for Men, I 
HEAR, Spread the seeds on his 
head, water, and that hair 
will be growing back in no 
TIME. 

• Did you know that 
cholelithiasis, cholecystitis. 
and cholangitis account for 
n'early 300 deaths each year? 
i don't know what any of 

THOSE THINGS ARE BUT rr WOLilD 
BE GREAT FOR THE OLD MAN IF 

YOU COULD FIND A CURE FOR 
THEM 

• Another interesting fact: 
There are 36.291 souare miles 
in the state of indiana, most 
likely, your dad owns a whole 
lot less than one of those. go 
mow it for him 

If all else fails, and you slill arc 
againsi the idea of getting him a 
lie. there are quite a few good 
books. Get something "deep," 
like Voltaire, or Hobbes, or 
Plato, It might fool him into 
thinking college has actually 
taught you something 

Bui please, in memory of our 
beloved Father's Day founder 
Mr. KalVa, don't gel anything by 
Dr Seuss

Old tricks, no toys 



Adam West must have 
been busy 



by Paul Tupper 
Editor 

The 1996 MTV Movie 
Awards were taped Sunday 
and will be shown tonight 
(June 13). This wacky award 
show honors what 
Generation X thinks is the 
hest of the best in the coolest 
of the cool categories. Next 
year, the executives 
should add a new 
award: Most 

Predictable Movie 
And the winner is, . "The 
Phaniom." 

The plot was borrowed 
from "Romancing the 
Stone " Multi-millionaire 
I&gt;rjx wants lo be even more 
powerful than he already is. 
So he discovers three skulls - 
one gold, one silver, one jade 
- thai together can give him 
more power than "man has 
ever seen." 

Whatever. 

Ilie Phaniom is a legend 
not many believe in. but for 
those who have actually seen 
him, he's lived more lives 
ihan a Parisian cat. Many 
claim to have killed The 
Phaniom. and they are all 
nyhi Bein^ The Phaniom is 
a l;iinilv huMness nicre have 



been 21 in all and the honor 
gets passed from father to 
son. 

Diana is the niece of a 
newspaper editor who has 
been investigating 
Drax's business 
ethics, 
which 




of course. 
L-ked She 
decides she will go 
to a spooky Jungle to rescue 
the skulls The same spooky 
jungle with which The 
Phantom resides. Diana was 
also a college flin who dated 
Kit, the latest Phaniom, 
Small world, isn't ii. 

Usually good actors Billy 
Zane (The Phantom, Kii). 
Treat Williams (Drax) and 
Krisly Swanson (Diana) can't 
seem 10 pull this weak script 
olT Zane is likeable enough 
and Swanson raises some IQ 



points she lost in "Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer." But 
Williams over-acts nearly 
every scene, turning this 
action -ad venture inio a goofy 
comedy Too bad it's not 
funny 

Knowing Kit and Diana 
used to have a thing, and 
knowing The Phaniom needs 
a son 10 pass on the family 
business, you can guess the 
ending, which a viewer 
ould probably have 
done from the begin- 
ning "The Phaniom" 
is really a cheaper 

version of "Batman," 
without the neat toys. Some 
comparisons between the 
two: Batman has Alfred the 
Batcave and a belt. The 
Phaniom has Albert, the 
skullcave and a bell. 
(Normally. 1 would have said 
there is room only for one 
Batman, but the revolving 
door of actors playing him 
proves otherwise.) 

"The Phaniom" is not the 
worst movie ever made. 
"Isiar" and "Howard the 
Duck" come to mind But it's 
not "Superman 11," either. It's 
rated R. but more suitable 
(or, and probably more 
enjoyable by the kiddies

Take a look: racism 
comes from within 



The eerie specter of racism 
has casi ils. sbulow over ihe

specter bums primarily African- 
American churches in the Souib. 
What has caused this recent trend? 
^Can this be the frustration of whiles 

who feel they have 

been taken advan- 
tage of by the 
afrirmative action 
system? Could Ibis 
be the act of one

ual?

by politicians to plant a better seed 
We are hopeful that will happen. 

One day these

Ignore Schott, play ball 



Tbis Lsn't Russia, is it? As far as 
we know this is the United States 
of America. Unfortunately, ibe 
owners of baseball still have not 
received their copy of The 
Constitution. 

This document guarantees 
Marge Scbott the right to be a 
crude, racist, nasty old hag No 
sane person would agree with her 
latest statements but she still has 
the right to voice those opinions. 
Baseball should condemn her. but 
they have stepped over the line in 
trying to oust her. 

Since when did major league 
baseball become a mecca for 
morality? The last thing many for- 
mer baseball fans remember is last 
season's shortened year and can- 



cellation of the World Series. 

This may be a desperate attempt 
on the pan of the owners to restore 
the family aspect of ihe game 
Unfortunately for them. Marge 
Schott bas the most family-orient- 
ed park in the major league. The 
whole family can still go see a 
game in Riverfront Stadium with- 
out taking out a moflgage on their 
house Hot dogs still cost about the 
same as they do in Fort Wayne, 
Try to buy a dog in Yankee 
Stadium without a cosigner. 

Here's a radical thought — 
ignore the bitter old woman. She'll 
go away one day Why fight her 
when fighting is the only thing 
she's good at?

Commentary 



Netanyahu, president? Maybe 




Vivian 
Lansky 



For the first time in hi ilIi lJI^u rv .nid 
that's only 48 years ol hMory the voters 
went to the polls in a direct elecuon for 
their prime mmister In the past, the president of 
the country invited all the panics to his residence 
to inform him o( their preferred candidate for 
prime minister. The president then called on die 
candidate he considered had the best chances of 
forming a goverrunent, regardless of whether his 
pany held the largest number of seats. 

This led to what many believe amounted to 
political blackmail, with the smaller parties rais- 
ing their pnce in return for supporting this or 
that candidate So, this year the horse trading 
may end with the direct election law or just 
assume a different form. 

Now, instead of looking to the president's 
Residence. Bibi Netanyahu, die newly-elected 
prime minister of the State of Israel, will have 45 
days to form a government which enjoys die 



support of ai least 61 members of the 
Knesset, Israel's parliament. If he fails 
to form a cabinet within this period, it's 
back to the polling booth for a second 
round of elections. And, in the highly 
unlikely event that he is re-elected but 
cannot form a government within an 
additional 45 days, he loses his chance 
to head Ihe couniry. Elections for prime 
minister will Uicn be held with a differ- 
ent candidate 

Netanyahu won Uie election with a slim 
majority: 50 3 percent to Peres' 49.6 
percent (as of^May 29). Close to 75 per- 
cent of the voting electorate voted in 
the elections; a large percentage compared to 
U.S. elections for president. 

The interesting phenomenon is the rise of 
smaller, splinter panics and the religious right. 
Netanyahu has appealed to die religious panics 
with his hard-line against giving back land in' the 
West Bank; land conMdcrcd by the religious 
nght as belonging to them from The Bible He 
will appeal to a new party, "The Third Way " 
who are adamantly opposed to giving up any 
part of the Golan Heights to Syna. And, I sup- 
pose, he might appeal to another new party. 
"Israel Be'aliyah," led by former Soviet 
refuscnik, Natan Sharansky, whose immigrant 
members respond to a strong, forceful govern- 
ment leader. 

So. if you count up the number of seats pro- 
jected for the 14tb Knesset, Bibi Netanyahu can 
make a coalition from the right-wing parlies, 
including his own party, Likud, the ultra-reli- 



gious ^nd the two or three smaller issue-oriented 
parties. 

Well, what does all this mean? 

One Israeli correspondent, a columnist for 
Ma'ariv. a prestigious daily Israeli newspaper, 
wrote that the Israeli public did not show that 
much interest in the campaign (cr.nirary to the 
way the American media covered it) because the 
public feels "the future is already settled, the 
ship of the state is on automatic pilot, and the 
helmsman can only affect the speed, not the 
process." 

If this is so. then most likely the army will 
continue to evacuate most of (he West Bank, but 
will not evacuate most of the settlements and 
most of the settlers. A demilitarized Palestmian 
state will be established in the evacuated territo- 
ry, and sooner or later it will be federated with 
Jordan. As for Jerusalem, 1 believe a lot of heat- 
ed rhetonc will fiow as to the "one and eternal 
undivided capital of the Jewish people," but 
Palestinian ciui-ens of Jerusalem, living largely 
in East Jerusaletn. will gain maximal autonomy 
and die Christian and Islamic holy sites will con- 
tinue to he protected and open to all. 

And now we can move to the next critical 
issue on the Israeli agenda, how to cul the high 
fatality rate on Israeli highways. I suggest we 
stop exporting cars to Israel until ihey develop a 
better public transportation system.

Ihe Fort Wayne Jewish Federation. She wrote

Tom Knjsc 



ecently, 1 came into contact with 
someone who works in the Child 
Support Division of the Allen County 
Prosecutors office. I have never seen her face 
but occasionally 1 ask them to send me some 
documents The latest one I needed to see 
was an account of how far behind my ex- 
wife is on child support. 

To this day she owes her chUd 55,779.77. 
This figure alarmed me because I began to 
realize what many women go through on a 
regular basis They fight widi the system and 
many of the men have figured out ways to 
lx;ai the system, even when 
their wages are garnished. 
In one case, I know of a 
man with two daughters 
who works as a server with 
no base salary, he collects 
only tips. He never stays at 
one place for too long 
Because he is paid cash. 
(he government knows 
nothing about it and dierc- 
fore he gets out of his 
responsibility. He gets a 
thrill because he beat the 
system. 

Being a single 
parent and holding down a 
job is incredibly difficult 
Managers and foremen are 
not very understanding 
when a suigle parent has a 
sick child or a baby-sitter 
problem. In die restaurant 
business, many places 
require you to work weck- 



ond.s. Finding a baby-sitter for these limes is 
especially difficult Usually a parent finds 
some teenager who is hopefully competent. 
Many of the teenagers are. but some have 
groups of people invade your house, do "God 
knows what" in your bed and teach your 
child all kinds of new words and phrases. 

Managers and foremen usually (but not 
always) understand single mothers, but single 
fathers are less understood when they call off 
because their son or daughter is sick. They 
must think because you are a man you are 
above those responsibdities. 

Businesses need to take into account the 
needs of all single parents It's a tough job 
and we work hard to be the best parent and 
employee possible. Sometimes the two con- 
fiict and we must weigh oui options because 
the answer is not black and white If we try to 
he the best employee, our children suffer 
because we work too many hours and neglect 
them If we try to spend more time with our 
children, we get fired for our troubles and we 
are left witb no means of support. There 
seems to be no happy medium between these 
two points. 

Many of us try to fmd a balance between 
school, work and being a parent. 1 have a 
great deal of respect for all other single par- 
ents and their amazing juggling act. Get to 
know a single parent — I can tell you from 
personal experience they need a person over 
the age of 10 to talk to Conversations about 
work, atx&gt;ut Power Rangers and about fmger 
painting only go so far Many parenLs need a 
good relaxing adult conversation to keep 
their communication skills from reverting 
back to first grade.

Rodman minds the 
opposition 



Jim 
Porter 




Say whai you like aboui Dennis 
Rodman, but you can'i deny his 
imponance lo Ihe Chicago Bulls, 
While there may be lillle socially 
redeeming value in his off-coun 
antics, his presence on ihe baskei- 
ball court has laken the leam lo 
new heights. He knows how lo win 
and, more importantly, he knows 
how (0 beat his opponent. 

In a different era. Rodman 
would likely be revered as one of 
the greais Without all of the hype 
and media attention, he would 
probably be more respected for his 
play rather than disrespected for his 
personality Unlike Babe Ruth. 
Will Chamberlain or even Joe 
Naimaih who were exulted for their 
athletic achievements while their 
personal lives were ignored, 
Rodman will never gain such 
respect. 

The character he portrays is a 
product of his own mind It's a cir- 
cus act he has orchestrated to per- 
fection Rodman thrives on the 
chaos he creates but to concentrate 
purely on the negauves of his life 
denies him the recognition he has 
earned as one of the best rebound- 
ers to ever play the gMie. 

Rodman lied an aJI-time record 
by grabbing 11 offensive rebounds 
ID game two of ibis year's TmaJs 
against Seatde. The Sonics have no 
clue how to contain him and no 
malter what George Karl tries lo 
do, his team cannol stop Rodman 
Seattle, in effect, has conceded 
almost 20 boards per game to 
Rodman But it isn't just bis physi- 
cal play that has baffled opponents 
throughout the season and especial- 
ly in the finals against Seattle^ 

"Dennis the Menace " has taken 
a number of the Seattle players out tl^^^^5^^ 
of their game plan While his "' "" ' 
teammates dishelvel the opposition 
physically. Rodman has disman- 
tled them psychologically Wiuwss 
the masterful job he has accom- 
phshed against Frank Bnckowski 
The Sonics backup center was 
ejected from two games as a result 



of allcrcaiions 
with Rodman 
His mere pres- 
ence on the court 
gives the Bulls 
opponents some- 
thing else to 
think about and 
Rodman lakes 
full advantage of 
(he opporiuni- 



Although he 
won't garner 
enough respect 
to be voted as the Most Valuable 
Player during the NBA Finals, 
Rodman may be the most import^! 
ingredient in the Bulls success 
After Chicago realizes its destiny 
by winning a fourth NBA title in 
the past six years. Michael Jordan 
will likely grab another MVP 
award Once again the player who 
has done the most lo ensure his 
team's success will go unrecog- 
nized for his accomplishments. 
Maybe the league ought to consider 
announcing the addition of a new 
award following the finals. 
Rodman would be the perfect can- 
didate for the firM-cver Most 
Valuable Mind award. 

It won't happen. After all. that 
would only bestow recognition 
upon a character we are all sup- 
posed lo despise and allow us to 
forget his on-coun contributions 

For all of his chaotic behavior, 
Rodman is still a player who plays 
lo win He may not passess the per- 
sonality qualities that would make 
him an ideal role model, but his 
tenacity on the basketball court 
deserves rtspect Instead of point- 
ing out why he isn't a character to 
be idoli?£d, maybe we ought to be 
poinung out those qualities and the 
dnve that make hun one of the best 
defensive players and rebounders 
on the court 

Take it as you will, just remem- 
ber the view from under the bleach- 
er Isn't always attractive, but judg- 
ing a book by its cover won't give 
you the plot either 



Giant dominates, Hit man leaving? 



by Rkk "Shallow Grave" Jones 
Staff Reponer 

In the hLSiory of sports, few men 
have dominated one sport so com- 
pletely as relative newcomer to the 
squared circle: The Giant The 
Giant is reportedly the son of Andre 
the Giani. Standing at over seven 
feet tall. The Giant, or son of 
Andre, won the prestigious WCW 
title from "Nature Boy " Ric Flair 
sevei^ months ago and shows no 
sign of losing his grip on the title. 
No one wrestler has been able to 
dent this behemoths armor At the 
Great American Bash in July, The 
Giant will face "The Total 
Package" Lex Luger. The Giant has 



already beaten Luger badly and 
probably will again 

In other WCW news, recent 
WWF title holders Razor Ramon 
and Diesel are defecting to the 
WCW and should have made dieir 
wresding debut by press time Both 
wrestler's thrived in the WWF but 
were relegated to ham and egg sta- 
tus several years ago when they 
first arrived in the WCW You may 
remember Razor Ramon as Scott 
Hall of AWA lag-team fame In Ihe 
WCW. he was known as the 
Diamond Smdd. I&gt;iesel was known 
as Vinnie Vegas. 

The WCW tag-team-tiile belts 
are secured around the waists of 
Sting ant] Lex Luger. They have no 



competition since The Road 
Warriors departed the federation 
shortly after they entered it 
Another factor is the Slicner 
Brothers are locked up in a feud 
with Scott "Flash" Norton and Ice 
Train There has been no clear win- 
ner in this feud yet 

No one is gunning for the 
Mexican sensation Konnan or his 
US. title The title has almost 
become non-cxisieni since he won 
it from the One Man Gang, a.k.a 
Hakeem 

The WWF tag team situation is 
the worst since Andre the Giant and 
Haku held the titles in the late 80' s. 
The Smoking Gunns, the Godwins 
and the Body Donnas are lucky no 



decent tag teams bave entered the 
federation since 1992. 

Shawn Michaels feebly grips on 
the Heavyweight title and faces a 
serious challenge ftom The British 
Bulldog. Davy Boy Smith. Smith is 
fueled by his wife's accusations 
that Michaels sexually harassed her. 

One name conspicuously absent 
from the title picture Ls Bret "the 
Hitman " Hart. Rumor tias it. Han is 
contemplating a move lo the WCW 
with Ramon and fJiesel 

Goldust. formerly the son of 
Dusty Rhodes, still holds on to ihc 
Intercontinental title but will proba- 
bly lose the bell to Ahmed Johnson, 
Johnson is on a mission to destroy 
Goldusi. 



Caliparl gets Nets head job- 
John Calipari returned to the 
scene of his final game as a college 
coach after he accepted the head 
coach's position with the New 
Jersey Nets. He will also cany the 
title of executive vice president of 
basketball operations. Calipari 
accepted the job only eight days 
after Kentucky coach Rick Pilino 
turned down a lucrative offer from 
the club. 

Calipari replaces Butch Beard 
who was fired by the Nets aJter itie 
1995-96 season Beard posted iden- 
tical 30-52 records in each of the 
past two seasons at the helm for the 
Nets 

U Mass went 3?-2 last season 
and advanced to its fu^i-ever Final 
Four. Ironically, Calipari's depar- 
ture came during the same week U 
Mass star center Marcus Camby 
admitted accepting cash and jewel- 
ry from an agent while he was play- 
ing for the Minuiemen Calipari 
denounced any connecLon between 
his leaving the university and the 
possibility of NCAA sanctions 
against the school. 

Calipari becomes the !5lh coach 
since the Nets began operations as 
an ABA team m 1%7 



LSU wins College World Series In 
dramatic fashion... 

Wanen Moms picked the most 
opportune time lo hit his first home- 
run of the season for the Tigers 
With two out in the bottom of the 
ninth inning. Morris drilled a shot 
lo right field that lilted LSU to its 
third CWS title in seven years with 
a 9-8 win over Miami University 

Moms, tlie number nine bitter, 
missed most of the season after 
breakmg his nghl hand early in the 
season and returned to the Tiger's 
Imeup just l&gt;eforc the regional tour- 
nament. He had only 14 RBI gomg 
into the College World Series and 
added three more to his total pnor 
to the championship game. 

The Tigers finished the season 
52-15 as they added to their nation- 
al titles from 1991 and 1993, 
Miami, which was seeking its first 
title smce 1985. finished 50-14. 

Americans net Irish In VS. Cup— 

The U S national soccer team 
took a big step toward defending its 
U.S Cup tide with a 2-1 victory 
over Ireland on Sunday The 
Americans, currently ranked 14th in 
the world, defeated an Irish team 
that narrowly missed qualifying for 



the highly competitive European 
Cup loumameni 

A scoreless deadlock through 56 
imnuies, the game's fu^l goal came 
off the foot of David Connolly from 
Ireland In the 58ih minute the U S 
struck back with a blast from 25 
yards out by midncldci Tab Ramos. 
Claudio Reyna capped the 
American win by redirecting a shot 
off the foot of Eric Wynalda in 
front of the goal in the 78ih mmute 
of the match. The U.S. record 
stands at 5-1 this season in interna- 
tional play. 

De La Hoya puts a hurtin' on 
Chavez- 
Oscar De La Hoya recorded a 
fourth-round technical knock-out of 
Julio Cesar Chavez to capture the 
Worid Boxing Council super hght- 
weight ude at Caesar's Palace last 
Fnday. 

De la Hoya cut Chavez above 
the left eye early in the first round 
of the fight almost before specta- 
tors took their seats He then beat 
the former champ to a pulp before 
referee Joe Coriez stopped the fight 
in the fourth round The final blow 
of the fight was a suff left hook by 
De La Hoya that caused blood to 
spurt from Chavez's nose- 



According to De La Hoya he fell 
Chavez's nose break as he hit him 
Tlie fight was slopped, reportedly 
due to the severe lareraiions to tbe 
left eye of Chavez. 

De La Hoya. who improved to 
22-0 with 20 knockouts, earned 
close to $9 million lor tbe tiouL A 
sellout crowd at Caesar'.s Palace 
and hundreds of thousands who 
watched via closed-circuit telecasts 
throughout the country saw Chavez 
lose for only the second time in 100 
career professional fights His 
record stands at 97-2-1 

The bout, which sold out within 
a week of its announcement report- 
edly saw $25 million wagered in 
Las Vegas. That figure makes it the 
most bet-on professional fight in 
history,

by Jim porter 
Sports Editor 

For Lloy Ball its a dieam com- 
ing true After beuig quesboned for 
his decision to slay in Fort Wayne 
and play volleyball instead of 
accepting a basketball scholarship 
from Bobby Knight, Ball is ready lo 
show people how right his deasion 
was six years ago As the starting 
setter for Team USA and the best 
server in the world. Ball and his 
teammates will tangle with France 
in Olympic caliber volleyball at

who have stood by me," Ball said 
"1 will be represenung my family, 
my friends. IPFW and the commu- 
nity at the Olympics " 

Ball also noted that a certain clo- 
sure seems to be taking place as he 
returns to Fon Wayne, 

"It's a chance lo show people 
that all of that stuff from the past, 
my dreams of being an Olympian, 
is coming true, ' Ball said. "All of 
lbe hard work that my father and 
tbe community pul into supporting 
me is paying off and hopefully I can 
give them a little gill back by repre- 
senting them weU in Atlanta." 

A former All-American while 
playing for the Maslodons, Ball 
credits bis father with giving him 
the drive lo pursue his dream and 
accomplish bis goals. If the team 
wins a medal at the Olympics. Ball 






noted that the great- 
est pleasure would 
be presenting it to 
his father. Amie 

"Sometimes I 
think 1 am doing it 
more for him," Ball 
said "He would give 
anything to be where 
1 am. but God decid- 
ed to give me this 
talent and height He 
look his ability to 
the max I see him

ate plans include returning

that the lime and pressures that will

Team USA a true national squad 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

Team USA has truly taken on a 
more national flavor as five players 
from outside of California play 
prominent roles on the team. In 
fact, three of the starting six players 
on the team are from the midwest. 
Jeff Nygaard and Tom Sorenson 
both hail from Wisconsin and setter 
Lloy Ball is of course from Fon 
Wayne Also on the team are 
Dexter Rogers from Florida and 
Ethan Watts from Oklahoma. 

Captain Bob Civnlik put il best 
when he stated tbe team has 
become a real national team 
"We're a national team and this is 
Ihe first time we are truly a national 
team " 



The US squad invades Memorial 
Coliseum to lake on France in a 
pair of pre-Olympic matches this 
weekend It is a chance for Fort 
Wayne lo get an up close look at 
top caliber volleyball It may he the 
only chance some of us get to expe- 
rience tbe Olympics first hand 

Team France is m a stage of 
rebuilding and is cenain to give the 
US team a handful of competition 
over the weekend Although the 
French have defeated the 
Americans only nine times in 31 
previous matches dating back lo 
1983, the last time the two teams 
met the US team defeated Team 
France in two out of three matches 
The lone lose was the only defeat 
for the US to a non-top three leam 
during tbe last pan of the 1995 sea- 



son The French failed to qualify 
for the Olympics but are a formida- 
ble foe for Team USA, 

With the Games of the XXVI 
Olympiad in Atlanta just over a 
month away, coach Fred Sturm says 
that although the leam is not ranked 
in the lop three, he expects good 
things, A strong showing against 
intemalional competition in recent 
months has given tbe team a 
renewed confidence The combma- 
tion of players from across the con- 
tinent has also added good combi- 
nations and competition lo the 
team 

"I think what leads to good 
chemistry is not where you are from 
but who you are," Sturm said
