City Christmas 
tradition-filled 



By CHRIS PYLE 

Christmas is a lime of rejoicing and 
upholding traditions such as tree 
trimming, caroling, gift giving and 
family reunions. But Fort Wayne has 
many unique traditions of its own. 

Santa Claus and his reindeer, a 
display that hung on the side of the Wolf 
and Dessauer Department Store for 
many years, lighted its way into the 
hearts of adults and children alike. 

But this tradition faded as a fire 
claimed the building. The store 
relocated on the comer or Clinton and 
Wayne Streets. They adopted a new 
tradition to take Santa's place; 
Christmas windows. 

The windows were elegantly lighted 



and festively decoi 



ited 



.VI th 



mechanical dolls and elves. Yet it 
couldn't quite match Santa's 
popularity. 

Now, the building looks deserted. No 
more store, No more lighted windows 
No more Santa. No more Santa? 
Wrong, Fort Wayne National Bank 
remembered ole Santa and cast him 
back into lights. Santa and his reindeer 
now reside on the side of the downtown 
Fort Wayne National Bank building. 

Fort Wayne has experienced trends 
in shopping too. Ten years ago. people 
would cram buses or maneuver busy 
streets to crowd downtown department 
stores. Almost every department store 
had a Santa Clans. 

Today, many shoppers have deserted 
the downtown area in favor of the 
shopping malls, and Santa usually is 
implanted in the middle of a mall. In 
efforts to attract shoppers downtown. 



however, parking meters are bagged 
during the holiday season to allow 
customers free parking privileges. 

Another Fort Wayne tradition is the 
lighting of the Christmas tree. Each 
year, a giant Christmas tree is lighted. 
People from all over the city gather to 
witness this gala event. Then in unison, 
they sing Christmas carols. This year, 
an estimated 2,000 people participated. 

Christmas is also a time of giving. 
Fort Wayne Mayor Winfield Moses 
emphasized some of the organizations 
that give to those who are not as for- 
tunate. Some of these services include: 
Toys for Tots, The Salvation Army, The 
Christmas Bureau, and WOWO's Penny 
Pitch. "These are good Fort Wayne 
traditions," said Mayor Moses. "We've 
got a lot to be thankful for; things could 



be w 



"he &amp; 



For the past three years, a different 
interpretation of Christmas has been 
presented at the Fort. 

Christmas was celebrated in the era 
of the late 1700s and the early 1800s on 
November 28 and 29. Members of the 
staff of Historic Fort Wayne welcomed 
guest participants from the North West 
Alliance and from Fort Miegs, located 
near Toledo, Ohio. 

The span of years past unraveled as 
spectators "journeyed through time" 
and observed Christmas past They not 
only saw a colonial Christmas, but 
other styles from other countries as 
well. There were interpretations of 
Polish, Dutch, Irish, New Englander. 
English. Scottish. French, and German 
Christmases

Ex-Beatle shot 

Lennon dies 

By DEBBIE CANTWELL McCormack, speaker of the House of 

and CHRIS PYLE Representatives. 

The amount of attention granted the McCormack received back page or 

death of John Lennon was significant of__ second page coverage, said Cantor. 

the former Beatle's importance, said "News of the ex J5*a lie's death appeared 

Louis Cantor, B?FW history professor. on the front pages of newspapers, and 

special radio and television tributes 



"His importance will be sustained," 
said Cantor, who referred to Lennon as 
"probably the most important mem- 
ber" of the sixties' four-man, English 
rock band known as the "Beatles " 

Lennon, 40, was shot and killed in 
front of his Manhattan home Monday 
night as he and his wife, Yoko Ono, and 
several other people entered the 
vestibule of the Dakota, (he apartment 
building where the Lennons lived. He 
died later in the emergency room of the 
Roosevelt Hospital. 

Lennon had just released an album, 
"Double Fantasy," which he made with 
his wire in what was to be a comeback 
for the couple A review of that album 
appears on page five of The Com- 
municator. 

Cantor, who will teach a Pop Culture 
class next semester, compared the 
media attention given Lennon to that 
accorded the recent death of John 



i frequent on Tuesday morning. 

The history professor attributed the 
media attention granted the rock 
musician as a "dramatic indication of 
the times and how they have changed," 

Cantor said some people have 
compared Lennon — who wrote more 
hit songs than any popular composer in 
modern history — to Bach, Brahams 
and Beethovan. "That's putting him in 
a pretty heavy group," the professor 
said, but commented he didn't believe 
the former Bealle would be historically 
as important as the others. 

Mike Gzybowski, 29, a student, said, 
"The Beatles were a symbol of the 
times, and the way he died was a 
symbol of the sickness in this world. 
They came on the scene and brought on 
a "turn on' — mystic religions, drugs, 
long hair. What he brought and how he 
died are in contrast."

Freedom and independence important 



Street people share Xmas season 



By ROBERT RINEARSON 
As a heavy snow falls, they stand 
patiently along the store fronts of 
Calhoun and Wayne streets. In second- 
hand coats, with hands buried deep in 



their pockets, they appear to be waiting 
for a bus. But as the hours tick by and 
many buses come and go, few of the 
faces disappear. 
Who are these people? 




Many of them are former residents of 
the State Hospital and the Johnny 
Appleseed Center, Olhers al one time or 
another have taken part in several of 
the drug and alcohol treatment centers 
in Fort Wayne. 

As I sat in Azars, I saw through the 
window the mixture of emotions these 
people conveyed. Some constantly 
laughed with huge grins exploding 
across their faces. Olhers stood with 
emply expressions and stared at the 
cement below their feet. 

Two men joked insistently with a 
Salvation Army volunteer who was 
taking a break, his bell sitting silently 
at his feet. 

While these people went about their 
regular daily routine, lawyers, 
secretaries and Christmas shoppers 
passed — oblivious to the fact that these 
people even existed 

I walked over and spoke with a man 
who'd been standing In the entrance of 
Murphy's with his face pressed against 
the window, watching the snow hil the 
street outside. 

"I don't care. Why should [? I don't 
have a job, and it doesn't look like I'm 
overgoing In gel one." 

Ralph Surface, director of Special 
Services at the Johnny Applcsecd 
Center, discussed why limes have been 
so hard for Ihese people. 

"Most who are lucky enough to find 
jobs must serve in incmul capacities, 
such as dishwashers or broom 
pushers." Surface said, And now since 
times have gotten hard, they were line 



first to lose their jobs, and Ihey'll be the 
last to be called back. 

"They gather at either Murphy's or 
Azar's to share svith each other," 
continued Surface. "And regardless, 
rain or shine, with work or without, 
downtown will continue to be their 
rendezvous point." 

H.J. Mehall. manager of Murphey's, 
said, "These are good people and good 
patrons as well. I don't core if they 
stand outside in front or in the waiting 
areas. Besides, wc feel it's a public 
service." 

Bui M eh all's good samarilan attitude 
doeslillle to change the status quo. 

"Fort Wayne has a high number of 
Ihese people," said Surface. "Some of 
these people have been in- 
siiliilmnalized for almost 30 years. 
There are a few still lucky enough lo 
have families to slay With. But for (hose 
who don't, finances will only allow them 
to rent a sleeping room — if they can 
even afford that." 

As 1 mingled through the crowds, I 
fell they could sense a stranger 
amongst them. I could talk and joke 
with Ihem, but until I disappeared, I 
could always feel their eyes staring at 

Surface fell it was uncanny how 
strong their camaraderie is. 

"They (eel they have no one else to 
depend on except each other, and many 
are no longer part of a structured 
program. They've ' been in 
6l Hullonalized so long, they feel if they 
accept any Offers, Ihoy will be pul away 
again and lose Iheir freedom." 



One of the street people. John, spoke 
to me about how he felt. 

"The hospital (State Hospital) is 
behind me now, and I ain't ever goin' 
back. What the hell? I've got a 
girlfriend and I don't need anything 
those places have to offer me now." 

Because of a need for freedom and a 
fierce sense of pride, most will not even 
accept what many local agencies offer. 

The Reverend John Fink of the Fort 
Wayne Rescue Mission told me what 
they were planning on Christmas. 

"We're going to have a good meal of 
roast beef, ham and all the fixings. 
Then throughout the day we're plan- 
ning entertainment, treats and a gift for 
each person," Fink said. 

"Now I want to (ell you something. 1 
don't care who Ihey are. whal they look 
like, what theeoloroflheirskinis.and I 
don't even want loknow their name. We 
proclaim everyone welcome, and these 
people are not going to achieve 
anything by standing in front of Mur- 
phy's," added Fink. 

But Fink sighed when he went on to 
explain how in many instances Ihese 
people follow the trend for the increase 
in suicide during the Christmas season, 
"It's very depressing indeed," said 
Reverend Fink. 

Many of (he people I lalked to along 
the lunch counters of the downtown 
stores showed little feeling about 
spending Christmas alone, 

'They are a complete subculture 
within our system," said Surface "li 
we arc able In convince Ihem that they 
no lunger need lo go through this self- 



deprivation, il will lake earnest people 
lo gain an initial trust from them. Right 
now, there's just not enough people 
willing to perform that service." 

As tne late December evening 
darkens and the working day comes to 
a close, for a brief moment you cannot 
tell the difference between the faces of 
the office workers retreating home and 
the people who call the street Iheir 

Suddenly, the seasonal lights are 
aglow, filling the night with a colorful 
Christmas aura. 

Al five o'clock. Ihe bells from the 
Cathedra] ol Immaculate Conception 
chime throughout (he city. Slowly the 
slreel people disperse. Some relurn (o 
Iheir sleeping rooms, while others walk 
over lo Azar's (or one more cup ol hot 
coffee, 

From a distance, I follow iwo of the 
men who have stood in front of Mur- 
phy's Ihe entire afternoon. They head 
north towards Main Street Suddenly, 
they are joined by a woman Iriend, and 
logether, the three 01 ihem walk lo Ihe 
light displays 

As they sland m li'oni of Ihe Inrge 
lighted Santa Claus that illuminates 
an entire city block, Ihey huddle close,

Editors named 



) If you were given one wish for 
Christmas, what would it be? 

That's what we asked people on 
campus last week. Some of their replies 
appear in "We asked, They Said." 
. This, however, is our answer. 

If the staff of The Communicator were 

given one wish for Christmas, we would 

. wish ,.. that Christmas lasted all year 

, long, and that the spirit of Christinas 

would never end. 

Unfortunately, come December 26. 
most of us will probably return to our old 
selves Unfortunately, it'll be back to 
■ business as usual, back to day-in, day- 
nut routines. Back to the same old hum- 
drum. Back to school, exams and term 
papers in January. 
When the next- issue of The Com- 

- municator hits the stands — and the 
floors — at IPFW, the holiday season 
will be over, the spring semester will be 

- underway, the year will be new, and so 
too will some of the newspaper staff. The 
small core of editors who oversee the 
production of the weekly paper, 



however, will all be "Communicator" 
veterans. 

Sandra Wiley, former copy and 
managing editors, will begin her year- 
long term as editor-in-chief. Kim Kuzeff, 
who has been with the paper two 
semesters now as reporter and copy 
editor, will serve as managing editor, an 
assistant position to the Editor. 

Steve Riegel will continue in his 
position as arts editor. However, Sports 
Editor Gary Baumgartner, who will be 
graduating this spring, will be replaced 
by Tim Ross, a photographer-writer. 
Julie Zent will continue as photo editor 
and Daryl Brandt will be the new copy 
editor. 

Sandra, Kim. Steve, Tim, Julie and 
Daryl know what lies ahead and they are 
anxious lo get started. In the meantime, 
however, the staff of The Communicator 
— like everyone else — will be taking a 
little break. 

Until then... 

Have a very Merry Christmas and a 
Happy New Year.

Once upon a final 



By NANCY SLICK 

'Twas Ihe night before 
finals, when all through my 
head, 

Not a neuron was 

stirring— they'd all gone to 
bed. 

The books had been strewn 
in array an the floor, 

And the eyelids weighed 
heavy; the clock ticked past 
four. 

I thought how the teachers 
were snug in their beds, 

While visions of failures 
flowed free through their 
heads. 

A long, soothing nap I 
sought, semester now 
fading, 

I'd taken to drifting and 
dream serenading. 

And as I dreamt, through 
my thoughts there arose 

The clouding of data that 
each student knows. 

I thought of the things of 
historical fame: 

The dates and ideas, the 
places and names. 

The twenties, 

progressives, Japan and R. 
Nixon, 

Jane Adams and Truman 
and A. Solzhenitsyn. 

Of numerous numbers I 
thought when I dared—

IPFW Chancellor 
Joseph P Giusti replied 
to our question about 
what wish he would make 
if he was granted one for 
Christmas. He said: 

As Chancellor. I would 
wish for another good and 
well-deserved salary 
increase for our faculty 
and staff; for ap- 
propriations to equip the 
multi-purpose building 
and construct an animal 
care facility and a fine 
arts complex ; and for 
IPFW to continue to be 
blessed with an out- 
standing faculty and 
excellent student body. 

More personally, I 
would hope that cures 
could be found for the 
many dread diseases 
which afflict millions of 
men, women and children 
throughout the world, so 
that these people could be 
free to lead long, healthy 
and happy lives.

By I It . LARKY KRAMER 
Every year at this lime, 
the whole western world 
plunges into an enterprise 
known as Christmas. 

From an economic point of 
view, the months of 
November and December 
are vitally important, 
especially during a 
recession. Business firms 
leetering on the edge of 
failure will sink or survive as 
the gift-buying trends of the 
shopping public rise or dip in 
their direction. 

From a social point of 
view, Christmas is a lime for 
parties, reunions and 
homecomings. 

From a medical point of 
view, it is a time for 
overindulgence, guilt, 
depression and physical 
injuries from domestic 
fights, unsafe decorations 
and traffic accidents. 

From a global point of 
view, it is a time of ironic 
contrast, as the glow of 
peace and good cheer fly in 
the face of world poverty, 
and rlii- rumbling of troop 
movements in eastern 
Europe drowns out the music 
of the Christmas bells. 

But what about the 
religious festival that lies at 
the base of all these points of 
view? Can there be any real 
connection between Ihe birth 
long ago of a so-called 
"Prince of Peace" and the 
hubbub of conflicting 



emotions that washes over 
us in the last month of the 
year? 

Maybe therecan. 

The early Church 
unabashedly appropriated a 
pagan winter festival lo 
celebrate the unknown birth- 
day of its founder. The 
original pagan feast 
celebrated the winter 
solstice as the beginning of 
the sun's return from its 
chilling annual retreat. 

In Christianity, Jesus 
stands for Ihe divine in the 
human, the good news that 
there is nothing basic in you 
or me that makes us in- 
compatible with absolute 
perfection, goodness, love, 
; whatever you want 



to 



all the 



ultimate 



projection of all that we long 
lo be. Darkness and cold are 
not positive evils, just places 
the light has nol yet reached. 

So should it come as a 
surprise that even those of us 
who profess explicit 
Christian belief sometimes 
celebrate that belief in an 
awkward, inconsistent, less 
than moderate way? Need 
we be disillusioned because 
most of us do not yet reflect 
perfectly the brightness of 
the unconquered sun? 

The feast itself offers hope. 
Christmas says it is possible 
to outgrow foibles, that it is 
normal to aspire to un- 
selfishness and maturity, 
that peace and good will are 



not unattainable goals. 

Progress in this kind of 
hope is not automatic. As 
each year provides ad- 
ditional opportunities lo 
develop skill in the art of 
Chris tmasing, we can work 
at celebrating love and 
renewal in ways that are less 
laden with unnecessary 
baggage. We can learn to be 
simple without being severe, 
to be hospitable without 
being ostentatious, and to be 
loving without being 
possessive or exploitative. 

The carol, "I Heard the 
Bells"saysitwell. 

"And in despair I bowed 
my head: 

"There is no peace on 
earth,' I said, 

'For hate is strong and 
mocks the song 

Of peace on earth, good 
will to all.' 

Then pealed (he bells more 
loud and deep; 

'God is not dead, nor doth 
God sleep; 

The wrong shall fail, the 
right prevail, 

With peace on earth, good 
will to all!'" 



Correction 



In a story run in last 
week's edition of The 
Communicator, it was in- 
correctly reported that 
Citizens Cable would be 
involved with a hookup at 
IPFW, and that Citizens 
Cable has offered to provide 
all the necessary equipment 
for such a hookup. 

However, Fort Wayne 
Cable vision — the city's 
other cable television 
company — will be 
responsible for the hookup at 
the administration's ap- 
proval.

Jews celebrate 'courage' 



BvfllKECEKKEN 

While Chrislians nrc using 
the last 15 days until 
Christmas lo prepare for 
that holiday. Jews are 
celebrating Hanukkah. The 
holiday celebration lasts for 
eight days and concludes this 
week. 

In America, its close 
proximity to Christmas 
tends lo blow the 
significance of Hanukkah out 
of proportion, and it lends lo 
have the same com- 
mercialization as Christmas. 

Hanukkah does not have 
the deeper moral 

significance of other Jewish 



holidays 

Kippur, 

atonement, 

celebration of the courage 

and resiliency of (he Jewish 

spirit. 

The origin of Hanukkah 
dales back to over two 
thousand years ago during 
the time when the forces of 
Alexander the Great invaded 
Jerusalem. The Jews were 
ruled by a Greek king named 
Antiochus at that time, and 
he drove the Jews from their 
temple in Jerusalem. He 
ordered them to worship the 
Greek gods, and anyone who 
refused was murdered. The

Jews fled into the hills, 

ganiied a revolt which w 
led by a family called the 
Maccabees, and fought back. 
A battle ensued, and the 
Jews took Jerusalem back 
from the Greeks. 

When they went to the 
temple, they found it 
desecrated with Greek gods. 
They cleaned it upandhelda 
prayer service. When the 
service was ready to begin, 
they couldn't find any oil to 
light the temple holy lamp 
which stands over the Torah 
and must be kept lit night 
and day. Some oil was 
eventually discovered, but it 
only enough for one day 
However, a miracle oc- 
flame 
burned for eight days. 
Hanukkah celebrates that 
miracle, and, more im- 
portantly, the triumph over 
the Greeks. 



Called the "festival 

ghts." Hanukkah 

represents that flame with 
an eight pronged candelabra 
called a Mcnorah. 

During (he festival, a 
candle is lit for every day the 
flame burned. On (he first 
day, one candle is lit, while 
another is lit on (he second 
day and so on until on the 
eighth day when all the 
candles are lit. The Menorah 
is displayed in a conspicuous 
place during Hanukkah. 

Today, the flame of the 
Menorah has come lo 
symbolize the miracle o( 
Jewish survival, and it 
reflects (heir faith in God. 

The spiritual nature of 
Hanukkah is expressed in 
the following passage of the 
Bible which is read during 
(he prayer service on 
Hanukkah: "Not by might

Hanukkah is also a time 
for the children (o have fun. 
They receive gifu and play a 
game wilh a spinning (op 
called a driedel. The top has 
four sides, each inscribed 
wi(h the Hebrew lelters 
which sland for N.G.S.H. 
The lelters represent the 
Hebrew sentence "Nesgadol 
haya shem." which means a 
great miracle happened 
there. The game is usually 
played' for candy, and if the 
top lands on N, the child gels 
nothing. H, he gels half, G. 
he gets il all, and S, he puts 
something in. 

For all Jews, Hanukkah is 
a time lobe thankful. It is not 
only Ihe celebration of a 
miracle, but the celebration 
of the courage found in (he 
Jewish spirit. The flame of 
Hanukkah seems to say that 
spirit will endure whatever 
lies ahead and continue to 
flourish.

Kids can now 
talk to Santa 



By CHKRYL GIBSON 

Children in Fort Wayne 
can now call directly to 
Santa and Mrs Clans. 

Ttie hotline does not go to 
the North Pole, bill to San- 
ta's workshop ai the Colonial 
Cresl Nursing Home on 2940 
Norih Clinton- 
Even skeptics would 
certainly .become believers 
in Santa if they heard Jim 
Bales, one of IB hotline 
workers, bellow out "Ho-Ho- 
Ho", or heard the gentle 
voice of Katie Klopfenstein, 
another worker, who speaks 
ihe pari of Mrs. Claus. 

Fourteen nursing home 
residents and four sub- 
stitutes service the hotline, 
which can be reached by 
catling the hotline, 433-284B. 
They work on hour shifts 
from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m The 
hotline will be open until 
Christmas Eve. 

A nursing home resident, 
Lauretta Limpe, estimated 
that they receive almost 80 
calls an hour. Some, she 
said, are cute, but some 
children won't talk so you 
want them off the phone so 
others can call 

Nina Forshea, the oldest 
Mrs. Claus, at 90, said that 
the kids can sometimes be 
full of pranks. When the 
phone rang, Nina's eyes 
started to sparkle. "Santa's 
workshop... Mrs, Claus 
speaking. ..Santa's out 



watering the reindeer.. .I'll 
give him the order. ..what do 
you want. ..what else.. .want 
any surprises. ..we'll try to 
gel them. ..bye." 

'Two things really im- 
pressed me. An ll-year-old 
boy wanted a new suit to go 
to church, and an 11-year-old 
girl wanted to have a bra and 
panties," said Mrs, Klop- 
fenstein. "One boy asked for 
a toy I never heard of and 
told me to go to K-Mart for 
it." 

Another resident, Oscar 
Harper, looks like the 
original Santa with white 
hair and a mustache. "I get a 
big kick out of talking to the 
kids," said Oscar. "A nine 
year old boy wanted an auto, 
but I told him I'd have to 
hitch it to the back of my 
sleigh." 

"Some kids just want to 
hear your voice, and I like to 
talk to kids. They also ask 
aboul Rudolph," said Bates. 

The callers range from 2- 
II years. The girls still ask 
for dolls, and the boys still 
ask for footballs and 
basketballs, but Star Wars 
has been in big demand. 

The center is also making 
bean bags, puzzles and 
plaques to give to children at 
the three hospitals in Fort 
Wayne. These gifts will be 
distributed by the residents 
on Christmas Eve.

Lennon 



Other students at IPFW 
reacted similarly Tuesday 
morning. 

"It sorl of shocked me," 
said Jill Holderness, 19. "I 
collected the Beatles albums 
and was still a fan of every 
member. They (the Beatles) 
were sort of immortal." 

Mark Wells, 24, said. "So 
many actors have gotten 
beaten and stabbed that it 
'Lennon's death) doesn't 
surprise me. The Beatles 
group is immortal, but in- 
dividually they're not. I got 
their first album and more 
than half of their collection. I 



grew up with them in the 
sixties. I remember them on 
the Ed Sullivan Show." 

Sue Lilie. 18. commented. 
"There will never be a 
reunion. Everyone wanted 
them ithe Beatles) to get 
back together." 

In The Fort, a student who 
was eating lunch said to a 
friend, "All the radio 
stations were playing 
Beatles music and I knew 
something had happened." 

Another student played 
"Imagine," a song written 
by. Lennon, on the piano in 
the Fireside Lounge

Xmas movies begin 



By MIKE GEFFEN 
With Ihe opening of "Flash 
Gordon" at Norlhwood 
Cinema last weekend, the 
Christmas movie season has 
officially begun. 

Christmas is one of the 
busiest times of the year for 
the major studios. The rush 
to get films nominated for 
the Oscar, people out 
shopping and more likely lo 
spend money on a film, and 
kids out of school with 
nothing to do but go see a 
movie, are the reasons why 
the studios release what they 
consider their big block- 
busters at this time of year. 

With more people going to 
the movies during this time 
of year, the competition is 
fierce as each studio battles 
for its share of the market. 
In Fort Wayne, the com- 
petition is going lo be par- 
ticularly tight because of a 
limited number of screens. 

Because of this, a number 
of the more serious films 
sure to be up for Oscar 
consideration will not play 
here until after the first of 
the year. These films include 
"The Fan," "Fort Apache, 
The Bronx," "The Jan 
Singer." "Raging Bull," 
with Robert DeNiro, and 
"Tribute." 

Of the Christmas films 
that will be playing here, 
however, there should be 
something for everyone. For 
science fiction fans, there's 
"Flash Gordon," for Clint 
Eastwood fans, there's "Any 
Which Way You Can," for 
satire fans. Buck Henry's 
"The First Family" should 



fill the bill; and there are 
still some films led over. 

Don't be fooled by Ihe 
hype, however, because 
Christmas films are not 
known for their longevity. 
Chances are that most films 
opening this month will be 
around for only three weeks, 
not a long-time for supposed 
blockbusters. 

Keeping that in mind, what 
follows is a list of films (hat 
will be playing in town for 
(heholidays: 

In "Flash Gordon," what 
Dino DeLaurenliis did to 
"King Kong," is done again 
to the comic-strip hero. In 
other words, it is a high 
camp spoof aimed 
predominately at kids from 7 
to 12. But then what else 
could be expect from a film 
written by the man who did 
the "Batman" T.V. series 
and featuring music by 
Queen? 

"Any Which Way You 
Can" is the film that asks the 
question, "can Clint Eat- 
wood make even more 
money by making a sequel to 
a film that starred an ape?, 
or. can an ape save him from 
another box office 
disaster?" 

"The Formula" is a 
speculative thriller about 
what would happen if the oil 
companies discovered a 
formula to make synthetic 
fuel used the the Nazies in 
the war. It stars George C. 
Scott and Marlon Brando. 

"The Arislocats" is Wall 
Disney's animated film 
about a pair of kittens who 
are heirs to a fortune and are 
kidnapped. The film has 
little of the magic found in 



By TIMOTHY J.ROSS 

Jazz! 

"It is the way the pen- 
dulum is swinging now," 
according lo John Branam, a 
member of the associate 
faculty and the head of the 
jazz section in the music 
department. 

Branam is also the 
director of the IU Jazz 
Ensemble and the Com- 
munity Jazz Band. 

Both bands performed in 
Neff 101, Dec. 2, under the 
excellent direction of 
Branam. 

Although the Community 
Jazz Band is young— it was 
formed this semester— it 
played, with a few ex- 
ceptions, very well. 

The IU Jazz Ensemble 
followed the Community 
Jazz Band with an im- 
pressive set of songs that 
featured several soloists. 
The best of the soloists was 
drummer Scott Weltner, a 
second-year member of the 
band. 

The highlight of the con- 
cert was vocalist Cathy 
Rowe, who sang a beautiful 



rendition of "The Children of 
Sanchez." 

Despite the less than 
capacity crowd, Branam 
was pleased with the con- 
cert. "Considering the 
shortness of time to prepare, 
it turned out well. The 
members really work. There 
Is a lot of enthusiasm and 
interest on the students' 
part." 

The jazz program at IPFW 
is expanding. The school 
offers classes in jazz 
arranging and Jazz en- 
semble. Being a member of 
the IU Jazz Ensemble earns 
credits for graduation, and 
any interested persons may 
audition for the band. 

The IV Jazz Ensemble will 
be holding concerts at local 
high schools to gain mem- 
bers for the future. 

There are also two con- 
certs scheduled for the 
IPFW campus next 
semester. The first will be 
Mar. 11, 1981, and will 
feature the IU Jazz 
Ensemble. The second 
concert, featuring both 
bands, is planned for April 
22, 1981.

might be considered an 
eighfies version of "Bob and 
Carol and Ted and Alice." It 
stars Shirley MacLaine, 
Anthony Hopkins, Bo Derek 
and Michael Brandon. 

"First Family" is Buck 
Henry's irreverent view of 
ihe While House and politics.

character as having the 
earlhiness of Johnson, the 
deceit of Nixon, the stum- 
bling of Ford and ithe in-

One cannot turn on the 
radio without hearing the 
sound of some "new 
discovery" dominating the 
airwaves. This usual success 
story ends up— in a million 
dollar single, thai is soon 
replaced, then later 
forgoiten. 

Such is not the case with 
John Lennon, one of Ihe 
founding falhers of rock-n- 
roll, who has just released 
his first album, "Double 
Fantasy," after retreating 
into seven years of married 
life with YokoOnp. 

"Just Like Starting Over," 
his new single on his self 
owned label. Geffen, is 
already in the top 40, just 
three weeks alter its release. 

However, just because an 
ex&gt;-Beatle has an album in 
the top 40 does nol 
necessarily mean that it is 
worthy of such a position. 

Such is the case with 
Lennon's new album. 

It seems that through this 
seven year rest, married life 



has gotten the best of him. 
Throughout the album's 14 
songs, we find our lovers, 
John and Yoko, forever 
searching for each other in 
songs such as. "Every Man 
Has a Woman Who Loves 
Him," only to lose it as in, 
"I'm Losing You," once 
again regaining this lost 
love, as in the song "Just 
Like Starting Over," and 
then letting us all know that 
they live happily ever after. 
Isn't that nice (how sticky). 

Musically, all the album 
can offer is Yoko's repetitive 
whining and moaning, that 
must be tolerated for more 
than half (he album. 

She does, however, relieve 
the audience lyrically with 
such (rite and overdone lines 
as, "Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me 
love. Just one kill will do," 
and "Give me something 
that's not cold. Come on, 
come on, come on." 

Such pretentious piffle is 
repeatedly drilled inlo our 
heads at least five times in 
every song! 



John also displays as much 
talent and ingenuity with 
lyrics such as, "Even after 
all these years, I miss you 
when you're not here. I wish 
you were here my dear 
Yoko." 

Perhaps the only im- 
pressive number on the 
entire album is Lennon's 
"Clean Up time," a snappy 
tune somewhat in Ihe 
tradition of the Beatles (I 
guess once a Beatle, always 
aBeatle). 

It is sad to think that a 
performer, who at one point 
was an innovating genius, 
has lowered himself lo 
produce an album such as 
this. 

Love is great, but to listen 
to an entire album of such 
sappy dribble, leaves one, 
simply stated, bored. 



(Edit 






This 



as written before 
the news that Lennon was 
shot in front of his New York 
apartment Monday evening. 
His tragic death truly marks 
the end ofanera.)

Whether wrapping 
packages, decorating the 
tree, or piling down Mom's 
cookies, nothing adds to the 
Christmas spirit more than 
the music of the season. 

There is an eclectic 
assortment from which to 
choose. All imaginable 
tastes and styles are 
represented, and the 
selections are almost end- 
less. 

For those who prefer more 
subdued music, one of the 
better Christmas offerings 
comes from Barbra 
Streisand. Many of the old' 
standards are featured as 
well as some songs not as 
immediately identified with 
the holidays. 

Especially good are her 
interpretations of "Silent 
Night," "The Christmas 
Song," and "O Little Town of 
Bethlehem." 

Streisand gives these 
favorites a beauliful warmth 
and vibrancy thai is hers

alone. The production and 
orchestration are gorgeous 
and complement her voice 
nicely. 

"My Favorite Things," 
from "The Sound of Music," 
and "Gounod's Ave Maria" 
are also lovely additions to 
this collection. 

The recording is several 
years old, but (he songs and 
her performance are 
timeless. 

Other "oldies-but-goodies" 
among the holiday albums 
come from Motown 's biggest 
acts— Diana Ross and Ihe 
Supremes and the Temp- 
tations. 

Both albums demonstrate 
soulful stylings that made 
them legends, and their 
respective harmonies are 
typically tight. 

Although (he material on 
Ihe two is almost identical 
(including "Little Drummer 
Boy" and "White Christ- 
mas"), Ihe different 
arrangements and vocal 
interpretations make each 






worthwhile ir 

dividual way. 

One of the newest 
Christmas releases is also 
one of the most popular— "A 
Christmas Together," by 
John Denver and the Mup- 

Whether you like John 
Denver or not, it's hard to 
resist this album, regardless 
of age. 

The Muppets make many 
of these familiar tunes more 
fun than they've ever been 
before. Miss Piggy's per- 
formance on "The Twelve 
Days of Chrilstmas" alone 
makes this album worth Ihe 
price, and their version of 
(he round "Christmas is 
Coming" is also terrific. 

These are just a_ small_ 
sampling of what is offered. 
Whatever the prefer- 
ence—The Boston Pops or 
Herb Alperl, Joan 
Sutherland or Elvis Presley, 
(he Carpenters or Johnny 
Cash— there's something for 
everybody

Eating binges add pounds . 



By DEBBIE CANTWEI.L 

Julie thought it a litUe 
strange when her perfect- 
fitting designer Jeans no 
longer fit. At least, she 
thought it was strange until 
she hopped on the bathroom 
scales. 

What she discovered was 
enough to make a person 
swear off the whole month of 
December. 

In less than the holidays 
are long, Julie had gained 
five extra, unwanted pounds. 
What had gone un- 
consciously into her mouth 
at Christmas and New 
Year's Eve — the gooey 
fruitcake, the milk 
chocolates, the creamy 
fudge and the sugar- 
sprinkled cookies — had 
settled noticeably on her hips 
and waistline. 

In less than a month, she 



had celebrated her figure 
away. 

But according to a nurse 
and two nutrition experts at 
IPFtt, that needn't have 
happened. A little dose of 
"common sense," it seems, 
might have kept Julie — and 
others like her — in those 
perfect-fitting jeans. 

The holidays, said Edwina 
Snyder and Debra Barnard, 
of (he Consumer and Family 
Sciences Department, are 
often "eating marathons" 
for many people. These 
binges "tax the body by 
dumping too much food in at 
once," added the nutrition 
instructors. 

There are ways, however, 
to curb overindulging. 
Moderation seems to be the 

Be careful of your table 
behavior, warned Snyder 



und Barnard. Pay particular 
at (en lion to the size and 
portions, as well as types, of 
food you consume. 

Some of the Hems they 
caution against are: deep- 
fried foods like potato chips; 
thick dips and gravies; foods 
loaded with sugar or salt 
(salt causes temporary 
weight gain of water, plus it 
makes you thirsty); 
alcoholic beverages with a 
cream or liqueur base; and 
foods high in fats such as 
butter and red meal (fats 
contain twice as many 
calories as carbohydrates) . 

Party hosts should "try to 
offer lower-calorie foods," 
said the nutritionists, since 
more people now are health 
and weight conscious. Meals, 
they added, can be planned 
around fish or fowl, which 
contain fewer calories, 



when 



,1-rvcd 



especially 
without the skin. 

"Keep il simple and enjoy 
(he flavor of the fish without 
having to doctor il up," 
Snyder advised. Potatoes 
are a nutritious side dish, she 
added, but sour cream, 
butter or thick sauces ladled 
on top don't add anything but 
calories. 

In addition (o cutting back 
— but not out — on' meals, 
Barnard and Snyder also 
recommended regular 
exercise. 

Starley Piter, the campus 
nurse, agree. Keep in shape 
all year 'round she said, so 
"during those happy but 
food-filled holidays you can 
risk indulging a little bit." 

But lo those who can't risk 
the binge because they're 
already out -of -shape, and 
who need to limit the number 



of bon-bons they sample, 
Pifer offered this advice: 

— Weigh yourself daily. 
Don't gain more than three 
additional pounds, she said, 
because "if you do, it (your 
weight) jusl keeps 
pyramiding." 

— If you anticipate an 
evening splurge, cut calories 
during the day. 

— Don't keep high-calorie 
foods and drink around the 
house, where you're tempted 
to indulge. 

— If you splurge too much, 
there is "nothing wrong with 
a 2-1-hour fast." But she 
cautions 24-hours only. 

— Above all, Pifer added, 
enjoy your'self. "The 
holidays are a time of 
sharing friendship. Some 
food and drink can make it 
more pleasurable, but it 
should not be the sole pur- 
pose to celebrate." 



. . . and alcohol adds calories 



The gooey fruitcake, milk 
chocolates, creamy fudge- 
and sugar-sprinkled cookies 
aren't the only calorie-laden 
holiday goodies. 

Alcoholic beverages also 
contain a fair amount. 

There are 80 calories per 
one ounce of alcohol, said 
Starley Pifer, director of 
Student Health Services. 
That's just a "straight" 
drink — ice or water mixed 
— without soda, pop or other 
ingredients At that rate, 



three drinks alone would 
total about 240 calories. 

A regular 12 ounce beer — 
a common drink among 
college crowds — has about 
131 calories. 

Besides the high caloric 
content, alcohol tends to free 
inhibitions, Pifer explained 
Once consumed, she added, 
the ability to rationalize 
one's drinking or eating is 
reduced, and over-eating is 
likely to result.

Traditions 

Continued from page 1 



(Continued from page 1) 

Among the festivities were 

crafts, traditions, cooking, 

music making and 

merrymaking. 

A Christmas dinner of long 
ago was cooked over an open 
fire. Imagine yourself at this 
dinner table: roast turkey 
with chestnut combread 
stuffing, green beans and 
onions in cream sauce, 
parsleyed potatoes, mince- 
meat tartlets, welsh 
cakes, pumpkin and apple 
pies, cider and dry sherry. 
The stuffing was described 
by James Yamelle, program 
director at the Fort as "the 
best stuffing I've ever had in 

Yamelle emphasized that 
the Fort not only reflects 
Christmas of yesterday, but 
that "many Christmas 
customs today stem from 
traditions of long ago." 

Speaking of customs, the 
Fort Wayne Children's Zoo 
has developed a unique 
tradition in the past five 
years; a lighted "animal 
city." 

The zoo is a spectacular 
sight as trees and bushes are 
decorated with over 42,000 
lights and 600 lighted bells.

Coed volleyball concludes 

The intramural coed volleyball league was to have 
concluded its four-team tourney last evening with the 
United Flyers playing the Savage Spikers for the league 
championship. 

The Flyers defeated the No Names and Ihe Spikers 
upset the Unexpected to advance to (he final round. 

The final standings, after ten weeks of regular season 
play, were: United Flyers, 10-1 ; The Unexpected, 9-2; the 
Savage Spikers, 8-3; the No Names, 6-5; The sting, 6-5; 
The Greeks, S-6; YPBC-Channel 14, 5-6; The Aces, 4-7; 
Geology Club, 4-7; the Mutants, 3-8; and DGTS-1 and 
DGTS-2, both 3-8. 



Tourney. The Tuskers beat 
Ihree-time-defending- 
champs Indiana Tech in the 
opener Friday night, and 
then defeated the only other 
city team to win the city title, 
St. Francis, in the final on 
Saturday. 

The Tuskers won both 
games at the foul line in the 
last seconds of the games. 

Indian a -Purdue freshman 
Gary Rinard hit two clutch 
free -throws with 54 seconds 
to go last Friday night, 
which enabled the Tusker 
squad to upsel Indiana Tech, 
76-73, in the first round of the 
Sertoma Tournament. 

The big victory was in the 
Championship game on 
Saturday night against Saint 
Francis. Again, in the Saint 
Francis game, the Tusker 
roundballers rode the hot 
free throw shooting of 
Rinard to' an overtime 
victory, which gave the 
Tuskers the Sertoma Tipoff 
Championship. 

Reflecting on the victories, 
coach Ken Workman said, 
"we won by playing tough 
defense, and with a mixture 
of all-around aggressive 
play." 

Trailing 75-74 with 31 
seconds to go in the over- 
time, Gary Rinard went to 
the line and converted both 
free-throws. Those two shots 
would be the difference as 
Ihe Tuskers held off Saint 
Francis to post a 76-76 vic- 
tory. 

The two victories over the 
weekend gave the Tuskers a 
4-3 record for the season, 
which proves thai Coach Ken 
Workman was quite ac- 
curate when he said, "I think 
we have the potential to be a 
.500 basketball team." 

These early season vic- 
tories have showed everyone 
that the Tusker squad has 
dramatically improved over 
last year's 4-20 club. 

Transfer Rickie Smith hit 
for 51 points in the two 
games and again signs of 
being the area's answer to 
Earvin "Magic" Johnson. 
He constantly found himself 
open in Ihe second half of the 
Saturday night game after 
being hounded the entire 
first half by Saint Francis 
defenders. Smilh was named 
the tournament's Most 
Valuable Player and was 
placed on the All- 



Tournament team. Also 
selected to the team was the 
Tuskers' Brian Grady, who 
scored 40 points in the two 
games. 

Speaking on Grady's play 
over the weekend. Workman 
said, "Brian is taking over 
the leadership role which 
will be an important factor 
for the team." 

Others selected to the All- 
Tournament team were, 
Rich Cox of Saint Francis, 
Jim Dalhke of Concordia, 
and Doug Gore of Indiana 
Tech. 

In the team's Friday night 
victory over Indiana Tech, 
Coach Workman's crew was 
forced to come back from a 
13 point deficit. The clutch 
shooting of Smith, Rinard 
and Grady cut the deficit, 
and along with some good 
team defense, the Tuskers 
were able to tie the Warriors, 
and eventually win the game 
on Rinar-d's charity tosses. 

The game on Saturday 
against Saint Francis was 
tied at 65 after regulation 
play. That's when Rickie 
Smith and Brian Grady hit 
some clutch shots lo put the 



Tuskers up by 5 in overtime. 
The Cougars came back 
though as it took the two big 
free-throws by Rinard to win 
the game. 

Coach Workman sees a 
very important aspect that 
has been a key to the team 
thus far. Workman said, 
"These guys take great pride 
in coming over their lack of 
size." Workman's statement 
is very factual as the Tusker 
squad has out rebounded all 
opponents this year. 

The Tuskers' coaching 
staff will have to find a way 
to bring the team back down 
to earth after the double 
victories in the Sertoma 
Tournament. 

The team had a game 
yesterday against Hope 
College, and they will battle 
Indiana University East on 
Saturday afternoon at the 
Concordia Gym. The action 
on Saturday starts at 2:00 
p.m. 

Saturday's game will be 
the last for the squad until 
they take to the court against 
Saint Francis on the 
Cougars' home court. That 
game will be played on 
January 3. 




Brian Grady, also a junior forward, was named to the 
Sertoma All-Tourney team along with Smith. IPFW was 
the only team to place two players on the honor squad.

Women drop two starts 



By CHRIS PYLE 

First game jitters rattled 
the IPFW women's 
basketball learn in their bid 
against Indiana Tech. 

In the first half, only 5 out 
of 26 baskets were made, but 
the Tuskers kept plugging 
away, ending the game with 
a total of 61 shots and a 33-70 

According to Coach Peggy 
Voisin, the team isn't 
familiar with each other yet. 
"The girls don't know who to 
Ihrow the ball to, or if Ihere 
will be someone lo rebound 
it." 

Sue Hendricks was the 



leading scorer with 
points, and Karen Dirksen 
followed with B. 

But despite the low score, 
the team learned their 
weaknesses. "We had our 
share of violations," said 
Voisin. "These included 3 
second violations, double 
dribbles, and many bad 
passes." 

In Ihe game against St. 
Francis, the Tuskers battled 
to the finish but lost, 60-55. A 
man-to-man defense was 
played. The Tuskers even led 
until the last minute of the 
first half. Perhaps the loss of 



the lead was due to ex- 
tensive foul trouble. 
Several fouls were made, but 
Jo Witte was the only Tusker 
to foul out. Voisin was op- 
timistic about the second 
half. "We got inside and 
drove more often. We also 
stopped a lot of fast breaks 
on them (St, Francis)," she 
added. 

The shooting percentage 
significantly improved in the 
second game as well. 
Dirksen and Hendricks 
accumulated 16 points each, 
while Amy Brunow scored 9 
andWitteconlributede. 



Among the players, 
Hendricks was the only 
Tusker picked for the Ser- 
toma All Tournament Team. 

Voisin described the team 
as a "real gutsy bunch of 
kids." With two games under 
their belt, the Tuskers feel 
more confident about their 
game. Voisin said that the 
team doesn't look down at 
their two losses, but faces 
them as an invitation to keep 
trying. 

The Tuskers will go into 
action Thursday and replay 
St. Francis at the Central 
Catholic gymnasium. The 
game will begin at 6:30 p.m.
