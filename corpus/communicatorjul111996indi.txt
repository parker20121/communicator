AIDS survivor speaks of unity 



Native American details healing process 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

For fourteen years Curtis 
"Ravenwolf ' Norton, who is 
o( Jewish and Native 
American heritage, has been 
plagued with the AIDS virus. Only 



wilhin the last few years has he 
begun to make signiricani progress 
in fighting its effects. 

In the past, he was confined to a 
wheelchair and had numerous near- 
death experiences. With the help of 
the spiritual traditions and medici- 
nal practices of his Native 



American heritage, however, be 
now says be lives a normal, healthy 
life. 

On June 26. Ravenwolf spoke of 
his battle with the AIDS virus to a 
small crowd in Walb Memorial 
Uniwi. During bis iwo-hour speech, 
he discussed a number of topics

from contraception use to his per- 
sonal struggles and bis use of native 
American medicine to fight the 
virus. The crowd listened to 
Ravenwolf offer inspiration to vic- 
tinis of a virus that presently has no 
known cure. 

"I will live to see the 
cure," said Ravenwolf. "I will 
live to tell my adopted grandchil- 
dren; I'll tell them I'm a sur- 
vivor," 

Ravenwolf said he was 
forbidden to participate in his 
Cherokee heritage as a child. 
Nevertheless, he often ran away 
on weekends to visit his Native 
American grandmother. He has 
spoken very little to his parents 
during the past eight years of his 
battle with the HIV virus. 
Instead, he took shelter with his 
grandmother and believes the 
medicines and traditions- of bb 
anceston have healed him.

If winning awards is a cause for 
celebrations, Channel 6 could 
have a parade. 

On June 8, ihe College Cable 
Access Center brought home four 
individual awards from the third 
annual Community Access 
Network, Inc (CAN) Video 
Festival, hosted by IPFW. 

Bernard J. Lohmuller, director 
of Ihe College Cable Access 
Center, won awards for the "IPFW 
Jazz Ensemble Spring Concert" in 
ibe live, professional category and 



also for the "Purdue- 
Indiana Theatre presents 
'A Flea in Her Ear'" in 
the entertainment, profes- 
sional category. 

Lotunuller, along with 
Gregg A. Schmiiz, pro- 
duction assistant, woti for 
their entry of "Men's 
Volleyball: Rutgcrs- 
Newark vs. IPFW" and 
were runners-up for 
"Women's Basketball: 
Indianapolis vs. IPFW" in

"The objective of this program 
is to share quality events of the efforts. 



University with the com- 
munity," said Lohmuller. 
"Our success is an indi- 
cator of the work we do 
and the contribution we 
make in the community." 
The College 
Cable Access Center has 
goals set for improve- 
ment and intends on giv- 
ing equal, if not more, 
effort to do so for the 
upcoming year. 
Lohmuller encourages 
any student interested in the lelevi- 
field to join them in their 



life. He became intoxicated fre- 
quently, used numerous drugs and 
had multiple sex partners. Now. 
with the encouragement of friends 
and his partner David, he has made 
a drastic turnaround. 

"I was only with David three 
months when 1 found I was posi- 
tive," said Ravenwolf. "It really 
brought us together; he's my push 
to go." 

Immediately after he learned he 
was infected. Ravenwolf began tak- 
ing prescription drugs. Within 
weeks, he developed many of the 
symptoms of AIDS: sores in the 
mouth, bone weakness, and pneu- 
monia. He blames the hospital 
treatments for these illnesses. 

Ravenwolf tried to commit sui- 
cide twice. His second attempt sent 
him into a coma. When he awoke, 
he found his grandmother watching 
over him. Eventually, with her 
assistance, he began to embrace his 
Cherokee heritage. 

From that time on, Ravenwolf 
has gone through many cleansing 



ceremonies. His tribe's prayers and 
herbal medicines, he said, have 
made him a healthier human being. 
He and E&gt;avid recently moved from 
Houston, Texas, to Logansport, 
Ind., to be with David's family. 

"TTieir prayers keep me going," 
said Ravenwolf. "My T-ccIl count 
is now 1.140." 

He focused on Ihe need for unity 
before any cure for AIDS can be 
found. 

"We need to get past the hatred, 
past self-righteousness," said 
Ravenwolf. "We need to join and 
fight this disease; we are the same." 

Ravenwolf s presentation had 
some moments of comic relief, 
such as his commentary on condom 
use for safer sex, 

"Before you go fishing, you bet- 
ter make sure you're wearing your 
raincoat," said Ravenwolf. 

Ravenwoirs presentation was 
.sponsored by United Native 
American Students, United 
Sexualities and Indiana Purdue 
Student Government Association.

Talking 'b©ut y©ur s^ncrati©n 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

They will soon become the 
largesi group of senior citizens 
America bas ever known. Ftooi 
tbeir early days of bucking ibe 
establishmenl to Uieir curreni trend 
of becoming tbe establishment, 
babyboomers bave in essence 
become ibe very symbols of 
America tbey abborred in their 
youtb. 

in an ironic tribute to ibe 
boomers, Time Magazine recently 
published its list of tbe most ioflu- 
enljal people of tbe baby boom gen- 
eration. Movie mogul Steven 
Spielberg dropped in at number 
two, heading the list was Apple 
computer inventor, Steve 
Jobs. Scattered along 
the lis! were several 
notable musicians, 
a couple of novel- 
ists and numer- 
ous movie and 
television star^. 

Initially the list 
seemed like more 
of a Spy magazine 
creation rather than a 
Time magazine story. Upon 
further scrutiny however, it became 
apparent that tbe list indeed repre- 
sented the creme de' la creme of the 
baby boom generation. 

So, with humble apologies (o 
Time-Warner, the following is a 
glimpse at the most influential 
Generation X heroes, 

10. River pbosniN 

OK. so he's dead, but so is half 
the gen-x crowd. Phoenix is an 
undeniable talent that was far from 
bis prime when he gave into the 
pressures of fame and overdosed. 
Anyone with a doubt about bis 
influence upon an entire generatitm 
of American youth need only rent 
My Own Private Idaho. 




9. Ren and Stimpy 

Nickelodeon and MTV catapult- 
ed this cat and dog team to cull-like 
status among many generation X 
slackers. With no jobs and a flair 
for the sublime, Ren and Stimpy 
may one day prove to be the 
Scooby Doo of their era. Besides, 
the "Where's Slinky" episode is all 
but a classic. 

8. "Puck" 

From MTVs "Tlie Real World." 
the scabbed, slinky and belching 
cast out is all that every generation 
X male strives to become and the 
very man that every slacking 
female secretly loves. 
Tbe fact he spoke his 
mind, did all that he 
wanted to do with- 
out any regard for 
what others tbought 
left a ray of hope 
for the youth of 
America. 

7&gt; Joe Camel 

An updated, too hip, cigarette 
smoking, party animal has become 

tbe new symbol for Camel ciga- 
rettes, Criticized for his appeal lo 
teenagers. RJ Reynolds has taken 
the heal and continued the cam- 
paign, 

S, Courtney Love 

If it weren't for her dead boy 
friend, tbe lead signer for Hole 
would probably be serving espresso 
someplace in Seattle instead of 
appearing ai every alternative music 
festival this side of Beijing She's a 
household name much like Yoko 
Ono gained fame by breaking up 
Tbe Beatles, Ms. Love didn't break 
up the band, she just drove ihe lead 



singer to commit suicide. 

5. Carrot Top 

The generation X answer to 
Gallagher, comedy's curly-beaded 
red bead uses his melon to m^u- 
faclure his jokes and the props he 
uses lo carry them off. His hilarious 
approach to everyday problems- 
like a toilet seal with a beaded pad- 
allows his audience to lighten up 
and laugh at themselves as well as 
their pathetic lives 

4. Pamela Sue 
Anderjon-Lee 

Need anything more be said? 
The babe of babes from Bay Watch 
Fame married ex Motley Crue rock- 
er Tommy Lee. After appearing on 
the mosl-watched television show 
in the world. Pamela has starred in 
her own feature length movie, no il 
isn't a porno. Tommy is full of lais, 
she is full of ... well you gel the 
idea. 

3. Snoop Doscy Doc 

Top selling records (CDs) with 
controversial lyrics shot da "Dog" 
out of Ihe ghetto and on lo fame. 
Gunshots and a dead guy couldn't 
keep the leader of the Dog Pound 
from bis accomplishments ll is an 
all too disturbing lesson of life and 
death that society has been too 
quick to grab hold of and too slow 
to let go. 

2, Kennedy 

MTV's socially conscious, ullra 
conservative republican VJ has 
influenced everything from fashion 
trends to the conscience of her audi- 
ence. She hob-nobs with political 
figures and inierjecis her ideas in an 
appealing naive manner that is 
almost comical. Before there was 



Lisa Lobe there was Kennedy, the 
"Lady of Camelot" for generation 



t. KurtCot^ain 

The grunge king spurned a 
whole new genre of screaming gui- 
tars and slurred lyrics while wear- 
ing lumberjack clothing. His style 
inspired a whole host of followers. 
Had it not been for a self-inflicted 
shotgun blast to the head, Cobain 
would have probably evolved into 
the generation X answer to Jim 
Morrison. 



Kurt is the idealistic icon of a aaually changed from geiKration to 



Therapy for the body and mind 



by JennJrer Sons 
Features Editor 

I'm sure everyone has 
experienced the effects of a 
five-minuie massage from 
their mate. But have you 
ever thought of a 
massage as being 
therapeutic? 

Recently. I 

attended a work- 
shop that gave 
meaning to the 
term "massage 
therapy". A 
massage thera- 
pist manipulaiesJ 
the soft tissue 
and muscles of 
the head, neck, 
back, arms and legs 
through the stimulating 
and relaxing power of 
touch. Not to be con- 
fused with a physical 
therapist or a chiroprac- 
tor, a massage therapist 
uses methods of nerve 
strokes, compression. 
vibration and other 
learned Swedish Movements, 
These movements relieve tension, 
restore and increase energy and 
improve overall well-being. 

Therapeutic touch can increase 
and improve Ute circulation of body 
fluid which, in turn, enhances 




healthy body tone and the functi(Hi 
of muscles and joints. 

Massage tberapy not only 
improves the physical body, 
including muscles and organs, but 
can also stimulate tbe mind. 
Increased circulation enhances 
the thought process so that 
one can better learn to relax 
and deal with the over 
stressed lifestyle of today s 
society. The therapeutic 
touch also has a uanquil 
izing effect on the cen 
tral nervous system 

A massage thera 
py session is the perfect 
(reat to end a stressful 
day or even just treat 
yourself because you 
warn to do somethmg 
good to your body. 

There are many trained 

massage therapists here in Fort 

Wayne and the surrounding 

area. Depending on location a 

session may consist of fifttcn 

minutes or even an hour. The 

only thing required of you is the 

ability to indulge yourself at a 

minimal fee. Just sit back and 

relax to tbe sounds of soothing 



music, the aromatic fragrance of the 
room and the magic fingers of a 
massage therapist, as you are freed 
from tbe stress on your body and 
mind.

Philosophy at the beach 



by Amanda Manton 
Copy Editor 

OK, what do 1 need to pack? Lei's see. I have my 
beach towel, baseball cap. boltled water, sun screen 
SPF 15. Whal could I be forgetting? Oh. here it is. I 
almost lefl one of the most important beach items, a 
good book. 

Thousands of people will venture towards the shore 
this summer seeking sun, surf and relaxation. Many of 
them, as tbey lay under a golden sun, will have their 
book of choice in hand, A stroll along the beach will 
most likely reveal titles from the likes of Daniel 
Steele, John Grisham and Margaret Bincbey, 

Having grown tired of steamy romance (yes, it's 
possible) and lawyer stories, my beach book of choice 
is a little atypical. This summer, I have chosen to learn 
about philosophy through a wonderful novel called 
"Sophie's World," available on Berkley Books. 

In "Sophie's World," author Jostein Gaarder 
weaves an enchanting mystery about a young girl and 
her philosophical journey, 

Tbe novel begins innocently euough, Sophie, tbe 
fourteen- year old heroin, is walking h(xne from school 
in Fmland and checks her mailbox. Wailing for her is 
a slampless envelope containing a slip of paper. The 
slip asks one single, deceivingly simple, question, 
"Who are you?" 

"TVho are you?" This one question could sum up 
"Sophie's Worid," As Sophie learns about philosophy, 
she learns about herself. I^ilosopby asks fundamental, 
yet enigmatic questions about the human state and the 



world in which il exists, 

Sophie continues to receive questions in her mail 
box and eventually finds herself enrolled in a corre- 
spondence course with a mysterious philosopher. The 
philosopher introduces Sophie to the likes of Socrates. 
John Locke and Karl Marx. 

In addition to the philosophical packages, Sophie 
begins to re&lt;xive other unusual mail. — this time post- 
cards fuL of birthday wishes that are sent to a strange 
care of Sophie, adding to tbe plot's unexpected devel- 
opments. The twists and turns ahnost appear fairy-tail- 
like at times, resulting m its cranparison to a modem- 
day "Through the Looking Glass." 

Gaarder has created a wonderful rtovel that gives a 
survey of Western Philosoi*y in a way that no text- 
book could ever do. Drawing from experience gained 
as a high school philosophy teacher, he explains 
Freudian theory and Marxism with straight- forward. 
everyday examples, 

Tbe novel's strong point is that the schools of 
thought and examples are always delivered in an 
entertaining way Readers lecjn widiout realizing thai 
they are being taught. 

"Sophie's World" has been published in over 30 
countries, reaching audieiKxs all over the world. The 
novel spent three years at the number one spot on 
Norway's bestseller list and found greai success in 
other European countries and the U.S. 

Sophie takes a philosophical Journey. As I read 
and travel along with her, 1 find myself asking many 
of the same questions she poses. 

Who am 1? Who are we?

Operation Rescue

OpciaiioD Rescue. Fort 
Wayne's inefrective 
atiempi al an anli-abonion 
organizaiion, leaves the cily quiet- 
ly. So Uwy (liink. 

AbonioD is still a boi topic in 
the couDiry Much like censoring 
the iniemci or rap lyrics. The dif- 
ference being aborlion arguments 
have been going on for what seems 

lo be forev- 

er. and will 
continue 
uDiil ihe 
tnillennium. 
Those who 
oppose 
define the 
act many 
view as 
lifesaving 
to be mur- 
der. Those 
wbo sup- 
port the 
right to 
abortion 
claim to be 
standing for 
gender 
equality. 
Roe vs. 
Wade 
proved 
even a 
Supreme 
Court rul- 
ing on the — — ^^^^^^— 
matter can 

not help people decide which is 
right and whicb'is wrong. 

So where does this leave the cit- 
izens of Fori Wayne who oppose 
abortion They no longer have a 
group 10 organize them. I!&gt;oes this departure is a temporary one. and 
mean they won't protest? Of that is probably true. Bui if ii 



'The people who 

BACKED Operation 

Rescue seem to 

forget abortion is 

currently legal... 

They should 
protest an act that 

IS illegal, LIKE CHILD 

MOLESTATION OR 

RAPE. Or PERHAPS 

THEY CAN PROTEST 

THE ILLEGAL PLACING 
OF CAMPAIGN SIGNS 
DURING ELECTIONS." 



But Ihe people who backed 
Operation Rescue seem to forget 
abortion is currenQy legal and has 
been for over twenty years. They 
should protest an act that is illegal, 
like child molestation or rape. Or 
perhaps they can protest the illegal 
placing of campaign signs during 
elections. Bui fighting abortion 
rights is a losing baiile. Politicians 
who find abor- 
tion morally 

commit to 
constituents 
for fear of los- 
ing voters. 

The 
organization 
was doomed 
from the sian. 
Its national 
leader. Randall

make his 

point. Randall

The 

group suffers 

from a lack of 
female leadership and will contin- 
ue to do so because we doubt many 
men would give up the control of 
so many women's ovaries 

Operation Rescue claims its 



course not. We can no longer be 
sure a peaceful approach lo

Commentary 



Under the same roof 




Paul 
Tupper 



For those of you who are won- 
dering: No. I'm not yet mar- 
ried. Yes. I'm still engaged. 
Yes. To the same person. Bui there 
is a new twist. 

My fiancee and I recently 
moved in together. We waited 17 
months. Kind of shocking if you 
know me on any personal level. I 
have never lived with a lover 
before (I usually break up with 
them first, and then I move in with 
them). But this new phase of rela- 
tionship has been refreshingly dif- 
ferent than 1 had expected. 

I have known niany-a-gay man 
to move in widi a lover much soon- 
er ihan probably wise. And now 1 
understand why. There is a sense of 
accomplishment that comes with 
cohabitaUon. I'VE SUCCEEDED! 
1 have what every gay man wants 
(at one time or another) I can get 
used to Ihis 



There is 
so much to do 
when you 
make such a 
giant step. 
And it goes 
beyond decid- 
ing where the 
couch will go. 
Who will 
wash the dish- 
es? Who will 
vacuum? Who 
will park in 
the right side 
of the garage? Who the left? Who 
gets the top drawer in the bath- 
room? Where should the good art 
go (yours) and where should the 
bad (his)? 

Another big question is Ihe 
finances. Do you gel joint accounts 
or separate everyihing? What if one 
makes considerably more than the 
other? What if one spends more 
freely lhan his partner? 

Moving in together really does 
change your lives. Before, you 
scheduled time lo see each other. 
After the move, you have to sched- 
ule time lo be apart (or you'll go 
nuts). You feel weird when he goes 
to another part of the bouse without 
you. You feel weird when he wants 
to go out with his friends. He wants 
lo watch "Star Trek," you want to 
watch "Are you being served?" 

You have to get used to each 
other always being around. If you 



haven't farted in front of each other evening)? Who is right when one 



by now, you'd better explain why 
you have lo visit Ibe bathroom 60 
times in a day. 

What about sex? I'll spare you 
the details, but the rules regarding 
sex definitely do change. This 
holds true for those other hobbies 
you have been engaging in since 
you were twelve (if you know what 
1 mean). Does living together mean

from the bottom and the olber

Dole claims smoking good, Koop wrong 




As a smoker, 1 have to laugh 
ai Bob Dole's latest foray 
into election rhelonc For 
some reason, Bob Dole said spiok- 
ing is not necessarily bad for you. I 



tbe fifties 
mantra, "I'd 
walk SO miles 
to smoke a 
Camel"? He 
may no( be out 
of touch with 
life but he 
*^9U&gt; eC^X seems out of 

touch with 
modem presi- 
dential cam- 
paigns. For a 
presidential 
candidate lo 
bop in[o a debate about minor items 
with his other foot in his mouth is 
just careless. He's like the Indiana 
Pacers two years ago when they 



Nol 
Beckley 

(4&amp; rnatA 



smoke quite a few cigarettes and 'eg'iimized Iheir season by beating 
die New York Knicks in Ihe play- 



cigars per day and I sure hope he is 
correct, because my life clock is 
supposed lo be licking faster than 
non-smokers. Maybe the cure for 
cancer lies within lar. nicotine and 
tobacco, but I tend lo doubt tbal 
outrageous hypothesis. 

Can Bob Dole be that out of 
touch with lite thai he still believes 



offs only to be squashed like a 
grape against Orlando. Dole's main 
drive only seemed lo concern the 
primary process with litUe thought 
for Lbe presidency Maybe Dole's 
handlers are lellmg bun be has the 
presidency locked up and nothing 
he could do could endanger bis 



position. 

Unfortunately for Bob Dole, be 
is matched against ihe consummate 
nineties politician in Bill Clinton. 
Clinton probably grew up with a 
television in his home and learned 
from hours of watching bow to uti- 
lize Ihis major tool. Dole acts like 
Dick Nixon in I960 when he was 
taken by surprise by television. 
Dole's speeches have neither tbe 
message or the fire u&gt; make tbe 6 
o'clock news sound bile on a regu- 
lar basis. Clinton on ihe other hand 
is a cyber president wiUi the fore- 
sight 10 exploit television and pboto 
ops to their utmost extent. His 
speeches although long-winded are 
spiced with sound biles tailor-made 
for the television news. 

Clinton even bas an unusual 
quality of getting into major flas- 
cocs, (see Waco, Texas; Ruby 
Ridge, Montana; Whitewater; and 
900 FBI files) Bui he comes 
through these battles unscathed in 
many Americans eyes The 
Republicans, in a vain ailempt to 
engage the president on character 



issues, have pubUshed a bocdc writ- 
ten by an FBI investigator full of 
mistruihs. nimors and innuendoes. 
This may have hurt Ihe Republicans 
more than Dick Nixon ever could 
have. What this book bas done is 
reinforce the popular (but not nec- 
essarily true) notion that tbe 
RepubUcans will stoop to any level 
lo gel what they want. The book 
has undermined any legitimate 
effort by Congress to expose tbe 
deception of tbe Clinton While 
House. 

Maybe the next few months of 
tbe campaign will completely honk 
everybody olf enough lo put an end 
to Ihe meaningless chaiicr on tbe 
airwaves. Then again this wouldn't 
be tbe United Slates if meanuigful 
dialogue was appreciated, (see Paul 
Tsongas. Steve Forbes, Ralph 
Nader and Alan Keyes) This elec- 
tion will be like every odier elec- 
tion in years past when tbe people 
go to die polls 10 cast their vote and 
feel kind of nauseous afterward. 

Who cares??????

Barkley creates havoc off the 
basketball courl« 

Charles Barkley allegedly 
punched a New York man late 
Saturday nigbl at a club in 
Cleveland, Ohio, where Dream 
Team III was preparing to take on 
tbe Brazilian Naticmal Team. 

Barkley and fellow Dream 
Teamer Reggie Mdler were at The 
Basement in "The Rats" area of 
Cleveland when the incident 
occurred Allegedly Barkley 
ordered Jcb Tyler, 23, to leave the 
establishment and Tyler refused. 
An altercation followed. 

Tyler Tiled a complaint against 
Barkley for hitting him in the nose. 
Consequently. Barkley filed his 
own complaint against Tyler for 
using "excessive bodily force " No 
arrests were made and no criminal 
charges were filed against either 



Wimbledon ruled by no-names... 

Richard Krajicck became only 
the second unseeded player ever to 
win die diustrious Wimbledon ten- 
nis tournament by defeating 
M.ilivia Washington. 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. 
The first unseeded player to wm 
the championship was Boris 
Becker who accomplished tbe feat 
in 1985. 

Krajicek's win completed a 
strange week at Wimbledon that 
saw the lop seeds all fall in the fu^t 
and second rounds. Adding to the 
oddities was a woman who 
streaked across die sacred turf prior 
to the start of the championship 
match. Weanng tKitbing more than 
an apron, tbe woman dashed across 
the gr^ss in front of Krajicek and 
Washington jusl moments before 
Ihe match was set to begin. 

Tbe victory by Krajicek dashed 
Washington's hopes of becoming 
the first black man to win at 
Wimbledon since ArUiur Asbe in 
1975. 

Marlins give manager (he hook... 

Rene Lachemann, die only man- 
ager in the three and a half year 
history of tbe Florida Marlins, 
became the fu^i managerial causal- 
ity of die 1996 season. The team 
fired Lachemann prior to a week- 
end game against the Phillies in 
Philadelphia. 

Florida fmished the first half of 
the season with a record of 40-47, 
14 games behind National League 
front-runnei Atlanta. Lachemann's 
record with tbe Marlins is 221-285 

John Boles, vice president of 
player development, was named as 
Lachemann's successor Boles 



joined the team in 1991 as the 
director of player develi^ment and 
was promoted to vice president last 
season. He has never managed in 
the major leagues. Boles last man- 
aged in the Kansas City Royals

Reds All-Star Barry Larkin's 
home Larina Lewis was arrested 
on charges of possession of a dan- 
gerous ordnance. 

Police found a Mololov cock- 
tail- a gas-filled glass container 
plugged with a rag- in Lewis's 
apartment. After being tipped by a 
neighbor who said Lewis had 
asked him how to make die device, 
police searched her residence. 

Lewis also allegedly had been 
seen driving past Larkin's home a 
number of limes last week. 

Larkin denies knowing Lewis 
and says he has never met her. 

No nudity for Suns- 
Due to an overwhebning 
response, tbe Palm Springs Suns -a 
class A minor league baseball 
team- canceled its latest marketing 
gimmick. Fearing possible safety 
problems, team officials called off 
the first-ever "clothing-optional 
day" at the ballpark. 

Team officials feared possible 
safety problems as a result of the 
vast number of interested patrons. 
In fact, die club indicated they had 
so many inquiries ihey could have 
filled Dodger Stadium with nude 
spectators. 




Dream Team III a snooze

Yawn /JJJJJ / J /J / / / f/ /'/■^^^^^^Tm^^^^ 

z The Dream Team is playing again Who gives a 

rat's ass anymore. We've already proved we have the 
best basketball players in die world and now we must 
prove it again. The Dream Team needs lo realize 
ibey are becoming a bully on the playground who 
beats up the same scrawny kid day after day. The 
bully's friends grow tired of these daily beatings and 
cease to support or associate wiUi die bully 

Maybe Americans will grow tired of The [&gt;Feam 
Team's thrashing of the Angolans, Brazilians and 
Russians and make an effort to get collegiatcs back 
into basketball. This would make tbc games at least 
exciting. Think about it. Would you pay top dollar to 
see Mike Tyson fight Peter MacNeeley again? 1 
wouldn't have given a bucket of spit to see diis fight 
die first dme and I'll be damned if I'd pay to see it 
again 

This ludicrous idea of a rematch is nearly the 
same as the Dream Team beating on the undernour- 
ished Angolans one more time Maybe the taste 
wouldn't be so bad if we would have had a Dream 
Team two years ago at die Worid Championships in 
Canada. But then again, who cares anymore. 

Tbe only bright spot on the team is Hakeem 
Oladjuwan Hakeem would never have had Ihe 
chance to win a gold medal if he played for the 
Nigerian national team, but now he is assured of 
winning one 

TTie players I really am ashamed of are Charles 
Barkley, Scottie Pippen. Karl Malone. John Stockton 
and others who have played on the Dream Team 



before. What else do dicy have to prove? Do 
diey have exceptionally small members? If they 
do why don't they just buy a gun like every 
other man in America with penis envy 

They are die best players in the world and 
do nol need to prove what die world already 
knows. They should step back like Michael 
Jordan and Magic Johnson did and let some of 
die younger players lake a stab at winning die 
gold. 

It has finally occurred to me why diey are 
called die Dream Team — They put the fans to 
sleep. It is that simple. Why didn't this moment 
of epiphany happen to me sooner. They are so 
far and above die competition it's a little like 

Camp Mohawk vs. Camp North Star in Meatballs. I

HuLK-AMANiA ends... Hogan joins the dark side 



by Rkk "ShaUow Grave" Jones 
Stan Reporter 

Although many have tried, no 
wrestler has ever been able to kill 
"Hulkamania," Until Sunday night, 
that IS. Sunday nigbl during 
WCW's Bash at the Beach, 
"Hulkamania" is officially dead. 
One man succeeded where Paul 
Orodorff, King Kong Bundy. Andre 
the Giant and Son, Randy Savage, 
Bobby Hcenan, Ric Flair. Lex 
Lugar, The Ultimate Warrior. 
Vader, The Undertaker, Yokozuna. 
Earthquake and Kevin Sulivan 
failed. What man could accomplish 
Ibis when the others fell by the 
wayside? 

HULK HOGAN himself ended 
Hulkamania when he pummeled his 
former ally. Raody Savage into a 
pulp, Hogan claimed he was not 
well received when he switched 
federations and took quite a beating 
from the fans Hogan was obviously 
not used to this Tbc pressure of not 
being number one in die fans hearts 
must have been loo much for the 
bleached blond steroid freak lo han- 
dle. 1 have bc«n waiung for die day 
when "Hulkamania" finally died. I 
had 10 wait eight years for ii, bul it 
is still sweet. 

In 1983, shortly after returning 
from a triumphant tour of Japan. 
Hogan defeated Tbe Iron Sheik at 
Madison Square Garden and 
claimed the WWF World Title. 
Hogan held die dUe for four years. 
During that time he fought off 
Roddy Piper. Paul Orndorff and 
King Kong Bundy. Hogan's 
mantra of "Prayers, vitamins and 
exercise" did not include steroids. 
The steroids took their toll on his 
body and he gained about forty 
pounds, 

Hogan also defeated Andre die 
Giant ai die Pontiac Silverdome. 
This was tbe largest Wcesilemania 
in history Over 100.000 people 



witnessed this match. 

In 1988. Hogan lost the title lo 
Andre the Giant in Indianapolis, 
This was the infamous paid off ref- 
eree incident, Hogan still had not 
been cleanly pinned since Andre the 
Giam did it in 1979, Andre gave up 
die title to Ted DiBiase, The title 
was then declared vacant. Randy 
Savage won the title in die ensuing 
tournament, 

Hogan and Savage became Ihe 
"Mega-Powers" and soon began lo 
walk all over the competition. TTie 
team disintegrated when Savage 
accused Hogan of coveting his wife, 
Elizabedi. Hogan promptly defeated 
Savage in the next WresileMania. 

Hogan held onto the title until 
The Ultimale Warrior pinned him in 
1991 for the first time in a decade. 
Soon afler, TTie Wanior was defeat- 
ed by Sgt. Slaughter, Hogan came 
to the rescue and defeated Slaughter 
for die dde. 

The Undertaker took Hogan to 
task and their battles were inconclu- 
sive. So inconclusive, in fact, that 
the tide was again declared vacant. 
The tide was won during the Royal 
Rumble by WWF newcomer, Ric 
Flair. Flair and Hogan met a few 
times, but no clear winner was 
found. 

Hogan virtually disappeared 
from die wrestling scene afler that. 
Hogan returned lo wrestling when 

■■-uji;ii.iii:intiiMJii&gt;w 



he learned with Brutus Beefcake to 
wrestle for die WWF ug team tide. 
Hogan lost that bid bul later on in 
the day he defeated Yokozuna in 
about 60 seconds for die WWF tide 
again, Hogan did not defend the 
title until several months later when 
he faced Yokozuna a second time. 
That was die last time Hogan held 
die WWF dtle, 

Hogan again left wrestling to 
pursue 3 less than mediocre acting 
career. Hogan was couned by Ted 
Turner who owns the WCW. among 
other things. Hogan entered the 
WCW widi tremendous fanfare, bul 
little fan suppon who still viewed 
him as die enemy. 

Hogan won die WCW tide from 
Ric Flair and foughl off all chal- 
lengers for a while, Hogan even 
scored an impressive win against 
Vader, This victory totally demoral- 
ized Vader and he soon left die fed- 
eration. Hogan lost die tide for die 
last time a little later to Randy 
Savage, 

Hogan repeatedly warred agamsi 
Kevin Sulivan who was bent on 
destroying "Hulkamania," Hogan 
faced Sulivan's Dungeon of Doom 
and came out mentally exhausted. 
He had been choke slammed by Tbe 
Giant (son of Andre) several times 



on a concrete floor. His psyche was 
damaged by the constant and unre- 
lenting attacks by Sulivan's min- 
ions. 

Hogan never seemed the same 
afler these beatings. Hogan seemed 
much more bent on hurting an 
opponent dian winning a match. 

Several weeks ago. two former 



members of die WWF began mak- 
ing appearances on WCW flagship 
program "Monday Nitro." Former 
champs, Diesel and Razor Ramon 
came into die WCW promising a 
diird partner in an attempt to lake 
over the WCW. Hogao was the 
diird. 

For the first dme since the sev- 



enties, Hogan turned his back on 
die fans who fueled his impressive 
career. Hogan betrayed the millions 
of fans who climbed on his back 
whenever he needed them. 

In the words of Tony 
Schiavonne, "Hulk Hogan, you can 
go to hell!"

Baseball All-Star game 
meant to please fans 

Not feed players ' egos 




Afier Iwo seasons of inner lur- 
moU aiuJ a strike that turned many 
fans away fiom ibe game, baseball 
is once again up (o iis oli) Lricks. 
Wfaen aJl seemed as if ii was going 
fairly well, all beU bas broken loose 
over an issue Ibai sbould belong lo 
ihe fans anyway 

In case you missed the discus- 
sion, here's ihc gist of the slory. 
Firsl, fans voied for their favorite 
players to play in the annual AIl- 
Star Game. I( is a ritual Ihal has 
gone on for what seems lo be an 
eiemily. Fans voie for iheir favorile 
players; the media and the players 
take opposiuon to ibe choices; and 
someone speaks ouu 

Granted, this year there are a 
handful of players who don't 
deserve to be called All-Stars. 
Likewise, there are a number of 
players who deserve to be on the 
(earn but were left off the rosters. 
Life goes on, or so you would 
think. 

Every year there is squabbling 
over those players that were chosen 
and those who were forced to sit at 
home and watch the game rather 
than participate. Each season a 
deserving player or two ot three is 
left wondering bow well he has to 
play in order lo gain the fans' 
respect It is the nature of the beast. 

The selecUon process is admit- 
tedly flawed. Anytime you put a 



group in 
charge of 
selecting the 
best players, 
you are bound 
10 have those 
who disagree. 
It is, however, 
the best and 
most accept- 
able process. 

The All- 
star game is 
supposed to 
he for the 
fans It is a chance for both Ihe 
American and the National Leagues 
to display their collective talents. It 
is alM) a chance for baseball fans to 
assemble their own baseball 
"Dieam Team." 

Aftei disappointing fans for the 
past three seasons, it is time for the 
game and its rulers to take a hard 
look at the facts. All-Star games are 
supposed to be about the fans. It's 
supposed to be a time of fun and 
relaxauon. It is a break at the mid- 
way point of the season that allows 
players and teams a chance to 
regroup and prepare for the stretch 
drive toward the pennant. 

Instead Ihe annual affair bas 
become more of a marketing tool 
and revenue generator, surprise, 
surprise Too many mediocre play- 
ers have bonuses written into their 
contracts and they raise a stink 
when they aren't chosen. Other 
times it is a player who for years 
has been nothing more than 
mediocre, then suddenly has a 
career in the first half of the season 
Sammy Sosa are you listening? 

Some, including ESPN baseball 
guru Peter Gammons, have called 
Ibe fans' choices a farce Gammons- 
goes as far as to suggest that a 
revamping of the selection process 
be implemented. Take the choice 
away from the fans he says. Oh 



good idea Pete. After turning the 
stomachs of an entire generation of 
fans due to greed, take away the 
only real connection the typical Joe 
Fan feels he has to the game. Next 
you'll wonder why attendance will 
once again fall to a new all-time 
low, 

All-Star balloting is Ihe last 
piece of the "Greai American 
Pastime" fans can hold on to. In an 
era where the average player gets 
paid 100 times what the average fan 
makes in a lifetime, it is no wonder 
fans have stars in their eyes So 
what if the most popular players are 
continually chosen. So what if Ihe 
National League's leading homenin 
hitler is snubbed by fans. So what il 
baseball actually gives the fans 
what they want to sec for once. 

With all of the crying and com- 
plaining going on, one would think 
there was some son of true injustice 
being perpetrated. Conversely, it is 
merely that the fans have spoken 
and chosen Ihe players they would 
like to see play with and against 
one another m the annual mid-sea- 
son game. 

For all of those crying and com- 
plaining players who wish they 
were chosen, consider the allema- 
live. You could be tlie average Joe. 
You could be the one paying the 
bills, forking ovct $20 a seal ai the 
ball park and another 550 or so on 
concessions. You could be the guy 
who has to explain lo his kid why 
certain players charge money for an 
autograph and how Albert Belle 
can do all thai he does and still play 
the game. Just remember, you are 
living the dream of a great number 
of those "average Joes" thai 
snubbed you in the voting process 
Maybe then you'll realize lhai it 
wasn'l necessarily a lack of respea 
for your statistics, but rather your 
crybaby attitude that kept you from 
playing in the All-Star game.
