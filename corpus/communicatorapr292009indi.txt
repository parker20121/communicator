While other students focused on an 
individual method ofgettingtheirname 
out to Ilie campus, the four friends de- 
cided ihal a group effort would prove 
more beneficial to their endeavors. 
According lo President-elect Amanda 
Marks, it was a conscious decision to 
not only go in on one ticket, but also to 
work together to promote tlieir cam- 
paigns. "1 believe we all had different 
things to bring to the ticket," Marks 
said. Having knoivn one anodier for a 
white, the group knew that they were 
capable of working together to form 
ideas and have "good dynamic discus- 
sions," 

The weeks prior to elections were vi- 
tal for each candidate. This year proved 
to have the most interest amongst stu- 
dents; with 12 people running for these 
positions, it was a challenge to set one- 
self apart. With this in mind, the four 
winning candidates got together to 
discuss how to promote their ticket in 
a way that would be recognizable and 
unique. Mickey Smith, next year's vice 
president of student programming, 
brought up the name PordeyColwell.

Allison Westropp took the idea of per-

"The other candidates did a great job of

that simply talking to the student body 
was the best method suited for the type 
of campus IPFW has. "It's a large cam- 
pus with not as many people involved 
- it's hard to gel the word out." She ex- 
pressed her point by saying that she 
would most likely do her campaign the 
same way again, if given the chance. 

With the school year reaching an 
end. president elect Marks is confident 
that her ticket will be ready for their 
upcoming term. The groups' collective 
efforts from the campaign helped them 
to realize their potential as a team. 
Their cohesion and hard work from the 
campaign should translate well when 
it comes to running the office. Marks 
concluded that she feels optimistic 
about the upcoming year and what 
IPSGA ivill be able to accomplish. "We 
can have disagreements that make us 
stronger because of them."

Obama's First 100 Days 

Country's issues far from having compreliensive resolutions, 
majority of American public remains supportive of administration 



By Katy Anderson 

Kathryn. Anderso nOipfwcommunicatororg 



A president's first 100 days in office 
is traditionally evatuated to measure 
tfie performance of a new administra- 
tion. Today, April 29th, marks Presi- 
dent Obama's lOOtii day in office, and a 
majority of U.S. citizens believe he lias 
met or exceeded expectations and the 
country is on track. However to some 
he has fallen short. 

When he first entered office, gloom 
was cast over the country and U.S. citi- 
zens had high expectations of what his 
first days would bring, especially in 
regards to bridging partisan gaps, im- 
proving the economy and repairing 
foreign affairs. ^Mlhough these issues 
are far from comprehensive resolu- 
tions, Obama's first days in office have 
been used to build a foundation for the 
rest of his presidency. 

In a Gallup poll conducted on April 
20 and April 21. 86 percent of partici- 
pants said that Obama was either meet- 
ing or exceeding expectations. When 
the pool of participants is broken doivn 
by party identification, 59 percent of 
Republicans said they were satisfied 
with Obama'sjob performance, 77 per- 



cent of Independents were satisfied as 
were 97 percent of Democrats. TXvo- 
thirds of the country also believes that 
Obama is making a genuine effort to 
work with members of both 
parties. 

Despite these efforts. Re- 
publicans mosdy remained 
unified in opposition to his 
policies, especially those 
of the economic stimulus 
package. Obama's econom- 
ic policies were the highest 
rated of all policies. Of the 
participants, 27 percent be- 
lieve his economic policies 
are the best things he has 
done since entering office. 
These policies include the 
economic stimulus pack- 
age, bailouts, and changes 
in lax policy. 

Conversely, Gallup also 
reported that 28 percent of 
the American public thinks 
the worst thing Obama has 
done so far is spend too 
much taxpayer money on 
bailouts, the budget, and 
the economic stimulus 
package. 

The American public re- 



mains optimistic of the new adminis- next 100 days will perhaps be more 

iration. Because Obama's first 100 days helpful in evaluating what sort of suc- 

have been spent building a foundation cesses or downfalls the Obama admin- 

for the administration, evaluating the istration is yet to encounter.

O'Connor lectures at IPFW; hopes 
to engage more students in civics 



By Katy Anderson 

Former Supreme 

Court Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor gave a lec- 
ture at iPi^ on April 24. 
Nearly every seat in the 
auditorium was filled as 
this was the largest lum- 
oul for the entire Omni- 
bus lecture series of this 
year. 

O'Connor's speech 
was entitled "Advancing 
the Rights of Humanitj', " 
and correlating with the 
Remnant Trust display 
currently at the Helmke 
Library, which show- 



cases "Controversial 
Documents That Have 
Changed History." 

O'Connor discussed 
Supreme Court rulings 
made throughout his- 
tory that she considered 
to be hallmarks of social 
change. 

The audience was able 
to ask O'Connor ques- 
tions at the end of the lec- 
ture. Audience members 
asked questions ranging 
from Supreme Court ap- 
pointments to issues 
regarding gay rights. 
However, O'Connor was 
straightforward and did 
not provide very lengthy 
answers for most of the 



questions. 

"I may not answer 
them, but you're free to 
ask them," O'Connor 
said. 

O'Connor did provide 
an extensive response to 
a question regarding a 
website she was instru- 
mental in implementing. 
O'Connor has grown in- 
creasingly concerned of 
the lack of education in 
civics in public schools.

Ways to save money, 
sanity, and your GPA 





Well, it's finals time. 
Time for staying up all 
night cramming for tests, 
writing papers ihat forget 
you wrote the next day, 
eating a bunch of crap 
from campus vending 
machines, and throvving 
yourself into total system 
failure, 

I love finals week, 
don't you? Let me give 
you a scenario from last 
semester's final exams. 
Picture it: 

I sat up all night in the 
Walb Union computing 
lab typing up papers for 
all three of my classes, 
trj'ing my best to A.) Stay 
awake and B.) Sound at 
least somewhat coherent 
in my papers. After all, 1 
was shooting for a pass- 
ing grade. So what did 1 
do? 1 went to Starbucks 
right before closing time 
and bought THREE tri 
pie shot laties and some 



cookies, 1 knew I ivould 
not be sleeping anyway, 
so I thought what the 
heck? 1 miglit as well be 
fully caffeinaled. Grand 
total: $22.57. Did I drink 
all those stupid drinks? 
Yup. Was it worth the 
money? Nope. I was sick 
as a dog the next day, 1 al- 
most went into a diabet- 
ic coma, and my papers 
rambled ridiculously and 
were as incoherent as I 
was. Granted, I passed 
my classes but my final 
papers were laughable 
at best. I shook like I 
had advanced stage Par- 
kinson's and every time 
1 peed for the next two 
days, my body made per- 
colating sounds. Awk- 
ward. 

So what's the point of 
this story? Simply put, 
don't dzo what i did. 
It's a waste of money 
and sanity. Instead, try 
something 



Uke this: 

Take a thermos full of 
coffee or soda and add 
some snacks to your al- 
ready stuffed backpack. 
Got a sweet tooth? Grab 
a couple of sweet snacks, 
but add in some healthy 
snacks like bananas and 
apple slices with pea- 
nut butter. Add in some 
protein because (let me 
put on my professor 
cap] protein equals brain 
food. 

Take a lot of mini 
breaks during your all 
night cram sessions. Get 
some fresh air, go sit on 
one of the many park 
benches around cam- 
pus, and stretch. Then if 
all else fails, hit the vend- 
ing machine for coffee, 
soda, or snacks. Bottom 
line: protect your budget 
by packing and a nice by- 
product is that you might 
actually ivrite something 
passable for your final

Letter to the Editor 

IPFW students make informed 

decisions when casting votes 



Dear President Obama, 



By Student Election Board 



The Election Board would like to 
clarify the incomplete article in the 
April 15 issue orThe Communicator 
cniitled "ElecUon Week Castaways" 
and also provide some insights into 
this year's election. 

The thrust of the April 15 Com- 
municator story was twofold. It was 
not about the Student Government 
Association elcciions, the candidates 
or die issues, but radier it was about 
some tenuous connection between 
pizza, voting and students being un- 
aware of student and campus issues 
and voting anyway. 

The Communicator implied that 
the pizza was more important than 
the voting or that voting seemed to 
be a requirement for pizza eating. 
Although the SGA voting tables were 
positioned near Spring Fling events 
to maximize student traffic and then 
facilitate voting opportunity, nobody 
needed to vote to eat and there was 
no "no vote, no eat" policy anywhere 
in play. 

The Election Board chose the 
election week to be the week of 
Spring Fling since there are more 
students on campus and they stay 
longer then. The premise was that 
students may be more apt to learn 
about SGA, the elections, the candi- 
dates, the issues and then be more 
inclined to participate than simply 
to drive to class and then drive away 
without even seeing or knovtring 
about the elections or Spring Fling. 

Furtlier. the article failed to note 
that voting began on Monday, April 
13, at 8:30 a.m. in Kettler Hall with 
no pizza. And voting continued all 
week with food, such as pizza, avail- 
able from the Student Activities 
Board mostlyai lunch lime, whereas 
voting continued on until 7:30 a.m. 
most nights after beginning at 8:30 
a.m. 

The fact is there were a total of 
60.25 hours of campus Election 



Board-sanctioned voting offered 
which overlapped with two hours of 
pizza offered by the Student Activi- 
ties Board, a whopping three percent 
of total voting time-the timeframe 
used for the article. 

Ttie Communicator also alleged 
that the IPFW students were unin- 
formed-yet cast "castaway" votes. 
This is baffling. 

This year in 2009, SGA sponsored 
two Meet die Candidate forums and 
three Candidate Issue Forums at- 
tended by hundreds in contrast to 
lesser attendance in prior years. 

The number of candidates con- 
tending for SGA offices doubled 
from the prior year. Last year there 
were seven, and this year there were 
12, including five candidates for 
president. 

Last year, approximately 9B0 stu- 
dents voted. This year that number 
was reached and exceeded on day 
two of the six day voting period. The 
weekly total was more than 1 ,800 - a 
new record. 

Were this year's issues publicly 
aired? Yes! Whether it be food and 
cafeteria options, the cost of studen 
t housing, campus security, student 
parking, or getting more fans to the 
Coliseum to basketball games, these 
and other issues were raised and 
discussed at the Candidate Forums 
with hundreds of students attend- 
ing. 

SGA grows and grows each year. 
From a volunteer low-budget op- 
eration decades ago, SGA now has 
paid officers and a budget exceed- 
mg $1,000,000 for the students for 
events, student organizations, travel 
for educational programs nation- 
wide, calculator rentals, and even 
student legal assistance. 

This year was a banner year for 
IPSGA elections and for one reason- 
the so-called 'castaivays " ivho voted 
to elect their representatives cherish- 
ing freedom of choice and informed 
voting for student leaders. 



I have been hearing an aivful lot in 
the news lately about stimulus plans 
and bailouts. From what I understand, 
these are actually very complicated. It 
must be really stressingyou out to know 
that you have a plan to save America 
but that the rest of the government has 
to vote on everything. 1 guess it takes a 
long time to make the magic happen. 

Anyway, Christmas does not come 
for many months and I'm worrying that 
Jesus didn't make it back this Easter, so 
I thought writing a letter to you might 
combine the; effectivenessof both writ- 
ing a letter to Santa and praying to the 
Son of God. 

Here's my situation: 

-1 quit my job to go to school last 
year. My job, which has taken me back 
for the last four summers, can't hire me 
this year, 

-My ivife just graduated from col- 
lege. 

-The job she's been working at 
where she was going to be promoted 
and work full-time put her on tempo- 
rary layoff, 

-1 have two cats who consume an 
awfiil lot of kitty food, (they're still 
groiving, they seem to be the only ones 
who refuse to tighten their belts in this 
shrinking economy. Just kidding; they 
don't wear belts.) 

-1 have to pay rent this week. 

-I have tickets to go check out Dan 
Deacon in a couple weeks but can't re- 
ally afford to buy gas to go see him. 

-1 voted for you. 

Basically I'm laying it all out on the 
table because you seem like a pretty 
nice guy and I think maybe you could 



show (hat to people even more by add- 
ing a personal touch to your economic 
plan. Specifically, you could stimulate 
me. Monetarily, 

1 understand that right now I am not 
very newsworthy and that bailing me 
out personally wouldn't garner the me- 
dia attention you cleariy deserve. After 
all, I am current on my taxes, have nol 
had one child, lei alone octuplels and I 
don't have employees to give bonuses 
with your money. However, I have an 
ever-weakening conscience ihai ivill 
allow me to do almost anything to gar- 
ner attention from the public media. 
Murder is not out of the question. Just 
tell me who pisses you off. 

Once I am famous for being a regu- 
lar guy pushed to the edge by poverty 
and weakened morals, you can swoop 
in with your golden checkbook and 
show the world how to extend a help- 
ing hand to those in need. I'm sure your 
style and grace will make the public for- 
get thai 1 am receiving taxpayer money, 
1 don't know why that's such a big deal 
any\vay... we gave it to you to spend. 

So let me know what you can do 
(anything, right?) to help, I would hate 
to wait around for your call and then 
have to hit up Vladimir Putin. I have 
heard that he is also a superhero. 

Anyway, this letter is getting long; 
Santa always puts me on the bad list for 
making my letters too long. At least I 
think that's what happens. Never seem 
togetwhat I want. 

Please don't blow me off, 

-Christopher Ray Harvey Jr. II

Hanas Thoughts Learning to let down gently in poor economy 



ByHanaAI-Hawash 

han3.hawash@ipfwcommunkdtor.arg 




DearHana, 

My friend has asked me to go on a trip 
to New York with her and her family once 
school lets out. Even though I desperately 
want to go, I recently lost my job and do 
not have the money. My friend has been 
planning this trip for weeks, and I don't 
know how to tell her without hurting her 
Feelings or disappointing her too much. 
What should I do? 

Sincerely, 

The not so big Apple. 



Dear "The Not So Big Apple," 
However you word this news, it 
is going to be a disappointment for 
your friend, if he or she has asked 
you to go to NewVork with their fam- 
ily, though, I would imagine they are 
a pretty close friend. This said, Ihey 
should be able to understand that 
you have lost your job and that you 
have other priorities with your mon- 
ey, being a college student. 

These days, some of us just can- 
not spend the money we have on 
things we truly do not need. Neces- 
sity is slowly beginning to rule our 



lives, and New York for a college stu- 
dents' vacation is not a necessity. 

So. I suggest you tell your friend 
about yourjob lossand that asof now, 
you cannot pay for the trip. Make sure 
you e.\plain that you would love to go 
and would love to be able to spend 
the time with them, but perhaps you 
coidd do it in a different way that 
would not cost so much, like hang- 
ing out when they get home. If they 
were hoping for the out of town ex- 
perience with you, a weekend trip to 
Indianapolis or somewhere close is 
much more affordable. 



Environmentally conscious businesses hide 
behind plastic bags, opaque greenwashers

Today, the term 
of spinning busi- 
ness practices to 
look like they are

when in actuality 

they really aren't, 

is referred to as "greenwashing." 

All of die current hype with using 
reusable bags started a few years ago, 
when the regular plastic grocery bag 
was declared a serious emiron mental 
hazard. Since the information hit the 
news, companies have been working

Plus, Target is contributing lo an ex-

is a vague term 
to say the least, 
many compa- 
nies have been 
using reusable 
shopping bags as 



leverage.

store sells the bags doesn't mean that 
the company is eardi-friendly. On the

die store to take home your purchases. 
There are no paper bags or plastic bags. 
"We don't bury the cost of free grocery 
bags, we instead encourage you to 
bring your own," the company web- 
site said. The store also doesn't have as 
much cardboard to throwoutorrecycle 
as other stores, because customers use 
the packaging to take home their food. 
On April 22, an EDrth Day celebra-

and sure enough, featured reusable

But next lime you are offered a reus-

there are worse environmental threats

A very divining p 
hit at Williams TF 



Story by Hana Hawash - Photos by Lu 



Upon entering the exquisite Williams Theatre on 

the IP[^ campus, you are immediately transported to 
another place. You are no longer in Fort Wayne. Indi- 
ana, but rather in a classic place like Boston. You sit 
down in your seat and the lights dim, the actors come 
QUI, the lights cue. 

From reviews and the title. The Diviners is expected 
to be a sad, utterly depressing play, but this is not the 
case. Not only is there surprise, but there is suspense. 

According to the 
IPFW website, the 
play goes a little 
something like this: 
"In the mythic town 
of Zion. in southern 
Indiana. Buddy Lay- 
man has the incred- 
ible gift of divining 
for water. His talent 
for water witching 
comes (tom his ter- 
rible fear of water. A 
tragic accident left 
him brain damaged 
and motherless as 
his mother drowned 
while trying to save him. A charismatic preacher ques- 
tioning his faith "stumbles" Into this town hefi-iending 
Buddy, helping him overcome this intense phobia, and 
propelling The Diviners to its tragic finale." 

The actors were equally impressive as was the entire 
.imbiancc. "The actors were amazing. It's unbelievable 
what these college students can do," said one couple 
in attendance. "They kept their composure, depicted 
the time and place very well."

Mcrvie magic at tfie 

Philharmonic 



By Louisa Oanielson 

Friday was the night for surprises and great music. 
The Fort Wayne Philharmonic showcased more than 
fifteen popular movie tunes from the American com- 
poser, John Williams. Music came from the movies Su- 
perman, E.T.. Schindler's List, laws, Raiders of the Lost 
Ark. lurassic Park and Star Wars. 

The concert opened with the March from Super- 
man. Blue and red tight splashed across the orchestra, 
recalling the colors of Clark Kent's other uniform. Tri- 
umphant brass soared above the swirling violin tones 



while a triangle shimmered in the distance. 

Lights changed from red to green as the sounds of 
E.T. settled into the auditorium. Sighing strings and 
trilling flutes, mimicking the litde alien, somehow hill 
of wonder yet slili real enough to make the lights spar- 
kle yellow against a blue backdrop. 

Concertmaster Hiromi ho had an entrancing solo in 
the theme from Schindler's List. In lyrical imitation of 
the actual movie, llo's notes gracefully sailed over a cel- 
lo and harp accompaniment. The music was mournful 
yet smooth. A low whisper of "Wow!" escaped the audi- 
ence as the piece slowly came to a halt. 

Almost without a pause, the orchestra moved into 



their next work, rumbling in the basses and cellos, 
gray and red lights flooding the stage. People began to 
chuckle as the French horns slid menacingly into the 
familiar laws theme, red light spilling over the musi- 
cians. Pounding drums and sawing violins brought 
the music to a climax thai, if not exacdy reminiscent 
of real sharks in the wild, was a perfect inlerpretalion 
of a deep pool with a huge drain grate under the diving 
boards. 

In direct contrast lo the menace of the ocean, a 
friendly little tune started up in the piccolo and tuba 
as the spotlights began to flicker. In perfect sync to the 
music, lights all over the auditorium flashed on and off, 
in red, yellow, green and blue, as the orchestra filled 
out the melody for the theme from Close Encounters 
of the Third Kind. 

The concert pulled into half time with the soaring 
strains from Jurassic Park. For music that went with a 
dinosaur/ monster movie, the tune is strangely noble, 
full of lonely French horn motives and cello notes. The 
music swoops, like a helicopter examining the surface 
of a new tropical island. TVumpets rang out a fanfare 
as [he piece drew to a close, drawing enthusiastic ap- 
plause from the audience.

Though, as college students, we do not have a lot

would pay eight

movie, but why not 
pay a single cent 
to go see something even better? 1 encourage you and 
your friends to support the !PFW Theater Department 
by anending all these plays. There is usually at least 
si.\ showtimes per play, so there Is no reason why you 
should not he able to make it. Set aside the party life 
for just a few hours of your free time, and go to a relax-

Baseball pounded in Louisiana 



By Dan Vance 

(iarLvanccSipfwcommunicatar.org 



The IPFW baseball team desperately needs 
wins if they want to quality for the Summit League 
Tournament aftera weekend seriesagainst Centenary 
thai had the Mastodons leaving Louisiana with four 
straight losses. 

With just two conference wins, the Mastodons 
were hoping to make up some ground in conference, 
where just the top four teams qualify for the 
tournament. They failed to do so as Centenary made 
the sweep official Sunday with a six-hit affair and 
an 8-1 final score. The Gents scored six runs in the 
fifth inning lo run away from tlie Mastodons, who 
got their only taste of scoring on a passed ball that 
allowed Scott Micinski to trot home. 

"That was the game where we really needed to 
build the pitch counts up and get into the bullpen," 
Coach Bobby Pierce said. 

In Friday's opener in Shreveport, Jordan Kohler 
hit for the cycle as part of his eight hit weekend, but 
the Gents edged out the Mastodons, 11-10. IPFW 
had pushed the lead to 3-0 in the lop of the third on 
a Kohler triple, but never pulled away much more. 
Centenary scored all of their runs in the fourth and 
seventh innings on nine hits. IPFW got homeruns in 
the lifth and sixth from Micinski and Kohler. Kohler 
had five RBI in the game. 

"Friday night was really frustrating," Pierce said. 
"The two innings where they scored, they put up 
crooked numbers and we grind out and put up some 
decent runs." 

Saturday was another good day for the Mastodon 
long ball, but not so much for the Mastodon win 
quest. Senior Shaun" VanDriessche went yard twice 
in tlie double header, in inning four of the opener 



and in the second iiming of game two. However, thi 
Mastodons fell in each (15-9. 7-3). 

In game one, IPFW opened up the scoring with a 
solid four run second inning but couldn't sustain the 
onslaught from the Gems, who scored six runs in the 
second and seven more in the third to pull away for 
good. Starter Josh Shatto gave up seven runs on five 
hits while Cory Bluhm gave up six runs on two hits. 
The two walked a combined 15 Centenary batters. 
Kohler also homered in the early game, his team high 
seventh on the year, tying Chris Gottschall. 

The day's close was not friendly to the visiting 
Mastodons either. The IPFW offense never took 
shape in the seven-inning game other than the 
second VanDriessche homerun and Mark Carden's 
3-for-4 effort at the plate. 

"This past weekend, our pitching at times was 
frustrating. At the same lime, they've performed 
really well for a long time and we haven't been that 
good offensively," Pierce said. "So we are talking 
more about consistency and trying to put togeihtr 
consistent performances." 

Kohler ended the weekend ivilh nine RBI, 
including his two homeruns. triple and two doubles. 
VanDreissche. Garden and Goltshcali each had rwfi 
RBI for the series. The first tivo did so on six hits each 
while Gottschall had five hits. IPFW's second leading 
RBI man for the weekend. loel Washko, had three RBI 
on three hits. 

The Mastodons now host Western Illinois, a 
Summit League opponent, on Saturday and Sunday. 
Both double headers are set for noon and 3 p.m. start 
times and will be diie finalw home outings of the 
season. 

"Everyone that is front of us (in the Summit 
League) right now. we still get a chance to play," 
Pierce said. "It's a make or break time. If we don't 
have a good weekend, it's

Would you like fries with that?' 



In All Directions - opEd 

By Dan Vance 

va n ce ■ la d. b I ogs pot . com 

Last week, Jeremy Tyler, a 17-year 
old high school junior in San Diego 
decided that he was just going to go 
ahead and drop out of high school. 
Not for any reason that a person \vith 
moderate intelligence would find 
reasonable, but rather to go and play 
professional basketball overseas. 

This is far from a reasonable 
decision for many reasons, both on 
and offa basketball court. 

The fact is that these days, players 
who enter the NBA Draft after foreign 
careers [though usually foreign in birth) 
are considered project players (one 
who mil take a lot of work) even when 
a NBA team does take a risk on them. 
Meaning thai come 2011, chances are 
that not only will Tyler be expected to 
adjust to the American professional 
game from the finesse he wiU then be 
accustomed to from Europe, but he 
will also have to do so without the basic 
fundamentals that basketball players 
learn on a college level. And that's a 
big factor, even as the only one on the 
court. 

Here is an- important thought that 
Tyler, his apparently crackpot father 
and "strategic advisor" should take 
into consideration: what is the answer 
going to be from a future potential 
employer if Tyler blows out his knee 
next season in Europe? If all Tyler can 
boast credential wise is that "I dropped 
out of high school, thought it would 
be a good idea to go play professional 
sports overseas, blew out me knee, 
came back and got my GED." Oh, I 



know the answer- 'would you like fries 
with that?' 

In years previous to the 
implementation of the NBA's age limit, 
players were taking a calculated gamble 
on passing on a college education that 
they could fall back on if the NBA did 
not work for any multitude of reasons. 
But the fact remained that at the very 
least; they would have a high school 
diploma in hand and the ability to 
attend a university even if they could 
no longer participate in athletics on 
that leveL Tyler won't even have that,. 
He won't have anything. 

All of these things considered, this 
does not seem like a ver&gt;'well calculated 
gamble to me. 

But the Tylers didn't take time to 
calculate here because it is all about 
the money and you can't convince me 
otherwise. 1 thought this long before 
I even heard about Sonny Vaccaro, 
that aforementioned strategic advisor. 
What in the world is that all about? 
Tyler's family is not well off, but really 
at this point, who is? This is about the 
all mighty dollar and the fact that more 
and more human beings are getting 
into the sports business, which itself 
is all about money. Wliere do we as a 
society or even those parents draw the 
line? 

Kids are getting recruited to college 
and professional sports younger 
and younger. College coaches are in 
middle school gyms, pro coaches are 
at summertime AAU hanctions for kids 
age 14 and up. It is ridiculous and it 
needs to stop. The problem is that it 
won't stop viith Jeremy Tyler. All he is 
doing is fanning the fire and making 
society and sport that much worse off.

For the first time ever, the Summit 
League tournament was held on 
Mastodon soil this past weekend. 
Tlie tournament started in the early 
morning Friday and ended later than 
expected on Saturday evening. 

"Hosting the tournamenl was great. 

1 think it was great for oul school and the 
actual environment we had out there 
was huge. We had a lot of people out to 
watch tennis and that's usually not the 
case," said head coach Eric Bums. "1 
think we had a great atmosphere which 
is surprising to me especially after we 
moved out to Wildwood because it was 
off campus. It was really good for our 
girls that everyone was behind them. 1 
am sure hosting was a lot of work but it 
was well worth it." 

Friday started with the men's team. 
With over 20 mile per hour winds, 
[PFW started out strong, but the 
winds changed as did senior Hermann 
Kuschke's luck. Kuschke led early 3- 

2 but soon after dropped the second 
two sets 7-5 and 6-0, ending his season 
with a record of 8-16 and 3-4 in the 
conference. 

"1 was really sad about iheir (mens 
teams) results. I think they played very 
hard. I think they overcame a lot of 
tilings this year with a couple guys out 
of the lineup, one from transferring 
and the other by injury," said head 
coach Eric Burns. "So they put in a lot 
of hard work and effort in to fill what 
we were missing. They baited hard in 
the tournament. I truly believe that we 
had a chance to ivin and just didn't get 
it done." 



Coming into the tournament, the 
womenwere2'l-3 overall and 9-0 in the 
conference. Friday the 'Dons began 
their day by winning doubles. By only 
needing three ivins in singles to win 
the day, IPFW got off to a slow start. 
Southern Utah gave the Mastodons a 
run for dieir money and pulled ahead 
on four of the six courts but thanks to 
Amy Recht, Alexandra Forsyth, Ingrid 
Ballus and Katie Brien, IPFW came out 
on top Friday night. 

Moving on to Saturday, the Lady 
'Dons once again grabbed the doubles 
point. Already up by one, they only 
needed three single wins to grasp the 
Conference title. Recht grabbed both of 
hersets6-2and6-4 and Ballus was able 
to finish 6-4 and 6-2, but there wasn't 
another win for IPFW for Uie rest of the 
day leaving them runners-up. 

"The women played hard all year 
long. There is nothing to be ashamed 
about by losing aginst ORU. We 
expected it to be a tough match going 
in it doesn't define our season. Being 
regular season conference champions 
and all the good things that we did, it's 
still a good year," said Burns 

Despite the loss this weekend, the 
women's team still has something to 
be excited about as announced at the 
Summit League banquet. Six of the ten 
members were named All -Conference. 
First team included Amy Recht, Ingrid 
Ballus and Alexandra Forsyth, and 
second team consisted of Katie Brien, 
Sachi Janek and Yuka Kobayashi. Along 
ivith the All-Confemce awards, Recht 
was also recognized as tlie Summit 
League Player of the Year alongside 
Ballus who was named Newcomer of 
the Year.

IPFW drops three in a row

Friday afternoon starred the series against the 
North Dakota State Bison as ihey made their 13 and 
ahalf hour trek lo IPFW field. The Mastodons ended 
up with only three home games on the week, because 
ofthe two games scheduled for Tuesday with Butler 
were cancelled on account of wet field conditions. 

Courtney Cronin came out with her cleats laced 
up tight as she rocked out the hits column batting 3- 
or-3 with one RBI in game one of two on Friday. Even 
with a total of seven hits, the 'Dons were out played 
and ended with score of 7- 1 . 

"The weekend overall we just got beat," said head 
coach Keith Fisher. "Up and down the line they are a 
better team than us and they showed that. We really 
struggled at the plate but I think our pitchers pitched 
well. With a team like North Dakota State, they really 
didn't over power us with their hitting but they have 
hitters that are aggressive at the plate and also on the 
bases, and that's how you score runs. They out played 
us. They are a better team and you can't deny that." 

The second matchup on Friday didn't go as 
planned either. Freshman Kaylee Faurote ended her 
night with tivo hits and sophomore Rachel Staschuk 
ended with three, but it was enough. (3-0) 

As Saturday came, so did the wind. With around 
25 mile per hour winds, and what seemed like a never 
ending dust storm. IPFW couldn't place enough in the 
scoring column. The Bison finished the final game of 
the series 8-1 improving their record to 28-16. IPFW 
currendy stands at 14-21 and 9-10 in the League. 

"We have Purdue on Thursday, they will be coming 
here and we will just do our best. They've got great 
hitters and, we are not going to give up, we are going 
to dial it over until the end. "Fisher finished .

Off the coun, the libero has been active with 
the university as the current President of the IPFW 
Student-Athlete Leadership Team (SALT) and in 
October was voted the President of the Summit 
League's Student-Athlete Advisory Committee. 

"Not only has Matt been a good player for us 
on the court, he's been a verj' active citizen in the 
athletic program," Ball said. "You don't replace 
those people, you just try to find people who can 
measure up." 

So far, theMastodonshave signed four freshmen 
to join the squad in Rob Samp. |.W. Kieckhefer, 
Elias Aparcedo and Anthony Randolph. The loss of 
both Morici and Pliske leaves a huge void at libero, 
which has been played almost exclusively by the 
two for the past five years. Current redshirt players 
Patrick Pinto, Eric Tomek and Garrett Bitter are all 
listed as potential liberos. as is Kieckhefer. 

In Semi-Final conference action this week. Ball 
Slate will play Levvis and MfVA Player of the Year 
Drew Pickering while the Ramblers will face top- 
seeded Ohio State on Thursday. The winners will 
meet for a spot in the Final Four on Saturday, all 
on the campus of Ohio State.

The Communicator is proud to name Chris 
Gotischall and Amy Reclit as our 2009 Most Valuable 
Athletes. 

Gottschall's season has yet to end, bul already he 
has demonstrated enough to lead the way in his level 
of value to both (he baseball program and IPFW in 
just his second year at ihe school. 

"He's just been a special player all year. He's really 
a happy-go-lucky kid who is always fun to be around. 
1 think he brings that lo other guys," baseball coach 
Bobby Pierce said. 

Two w&lt;rekends ago sfgainsi Oakland, Gottschall 
belted tliree separate homeruns including two in one 
game where he all but beat the Grizzlies by himself on 
his way to Summit League Player of llie Week honors. 
On offense, he leads ihe Mastodons in almost every 
statistical category, including batting average (.373), 
hits (57). doubles (19), homeruns (7) and slugging 
percentage (.647). On defense, he has been .solid 
moving between shortstop and first base (for injured 
Shaun VanDriessche) with a .929 fielding percentage, 
including being involved in 25 double plays. 

"Having him in the middle of the lineup is really 
special I wish he had anodier year," Pierce said. 
"People pitch around him - he's pretty dangerous. 
Everybody is concerned where he is at in the lineup 
and how they pitch to him." 

Recht dominated on the tennis couns, especially 
in the spring, with a perfect mark in the Summit 
League. She completed her second straight Summit 
League Women's Tennis Player of the Year run on 
Saturday with a win at #1 singles in the conference 
title match. 

"She's basically the best player in the history of 
the program at this point. She has almost won as 
many matches in two years as Lisa Bartelheim, who 
hold the record ofthe most wins in the history of our 
program," tennis coach Eric Burns said. 

Although IPFW lost in die finals. Recht was 9-0 
in conference and 25-2 overall at singles during the 
spring. In doubles play, she was 19-6 including a 2-0 
mark with Katie Brien. She won the other 17 doubles 
matches alongside Sachi lanek. Along the way, 
Recht captured three Summit League Player of the 
Week honors. Ilechl went 4-0 total in the conference 
tournament after finishing the regular season on a 



12-match winning streak and finished the year 33-5 
overall with a two-year record of 64-10. 

"She came in her first two years at the top of the 
lineup and put in those kind of numbers- that's 
something special," Burns said, "Everything she has 
done has been excellent." 

On the men's side of things, Gotischall is followed 
inTheCommunicator'sTop 5 by four individuals who 
all had strong years and are also still relatively new 
lo IPFW athletics. At number two is Ben Duckworth 
(volleyball), who was ranked high nationally in service 
aces all year and finished with 50, good enough for 
fourth on the all-lime single season list. Third place 
goes to freshman Max Toulette (soccer) who joined 
the team after the season had already started but 
managed to score five goals in only nine shols on 
goal. He also added Uvo assists in his 15 games. 
Fourth and fifth belong lo basketball teammates 
Deilvez Yearby and David Carson. Yearby took his 
place on the conference's 2nd Team and was the 
Summit League's Sixth Man ofthe Year, tying IPFW's 
single season block record at 54 while Carson was All- 
Conference Honorable Mention while leading IPFW 
al 14.8 points per game contest. 

The second place female was inches away from 
the top spot. Crystina Martinez had another blazing 
year on the track and the cross country course. She 
won five Summit League Athlete of the Week awards 
in route to a unanimous conference Runner of the 
Year honor. In the spring, she broke record after 
record (many of her own). In third.. Rebekah Roehm 
(volleyball) passed 1.000 kills for her career \vith 302 
as a senior on her way to an All -Conference First 
Team nod. Founh place Chelsey Jackson (basketball) 
averaged 13. 3 pointsandtotaled59 assists tobenamed 
to the Summit League Second Team. Wrapping up 
the women. Crystal Martinez followed behind her 
sister most of the year but surpassed her at the end 
of the fall in becoming the first IPFW runner to ever 
compete at the NCAA National Cross Country Meet. 

The Communicator's Most Valuable Athlete 
Award was first presetited in 2005 lo volleyball players 
Fabiana Souza and Matt Zbyszewski and won again 
in 2006 by Souza, alongside another volleyball player, 
C.I. Macias. After a one year absence, the award was 
given to one athlete in 2008 with basketball standout 
johnna Lewis-Cariisle leading the way. Although no 
separate, gender specific awards were given, laraun 
Burrows (basketball) was the top ranked male athlete 
by the Communicator in 2008.
