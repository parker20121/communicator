Fair Brings Local Jobs to IPFW Students 



Walb Ballroom was recenth lilted 
With 65 employers waiting to meet 
IPFW students who wore looking lor 
an opportunity to progress in their 
chosen career. 

The career and internship fair, held 
on Thursday, Sept. 28, was an oppor- 
tunity for students to meet with future 
employers and build relationships with 
the surrounding community. 

"This is the fourth year for this fair, 
and every year more employers oiler 



full-time jobs and internships to IPFW 
students and alumni," said Kacee Fer- 
rell, assistant director of academic 
counseling and career services. 

According to Ferrell. there were 
over 300 students at the fair last year. 
This year's event saw a similar turnout. 
with 275 students attending. 

"The thing wc want students to un- 
derstand is that there are jobs for them 
and this fair is free. All the employers 
here are looking for IPFW students and 



Enterprise Rent-A-Car, belie 



the internship fair is important 
to students not only because 
they are able to make connec- 
tions with future employers, but 
because they can also experi- 
ence what is outside of college. 
Doug Barrow, station man- 
ager for both WPTA-TV and 
WISE-TV said, "You don't even

Nobel Prize Winner Addresses IPFW Students 

Lauterbur's work lead to the development of MRI technology 



By Laura Dumas 



If you have ever had an MRI, you 
&gt;ht want to thank Dr. Paul C. Laut- 
irbur, winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize 
Medicine and Physiology, and a re- 
nt guest at IPFW. 

Last week, Lauterbur, whose work 
a to the creation of MRI scanning. 
ipoke at the 4th annual Opportunity 
3anquct, an event held in Walb Ball- 
that focused on career planning 
ind decisions. 

"Today's activities really repre- 
t the importance of universities in 
's life," Carl Drummond, associ- 
chancellor for research and exter- 
ial support, said the afternoon before 
-auterbur's appearance. 

Lauterbur, who has been a faculty 
nember at the University of Illinois 
er 20 years, is especially inter- 




ested in chemistry and its role in the 
origin of life. 

He initially began studying nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) while a re- 
search associate al the Mellon Institute. 
Dr Lauterbur, who in 1962 received his 
Ph.D. in chemistry from the University 
of Pittsburgh, was one of the first sci- 
entists to use NMR to study solutions, 
solids, and molecules, he later applied 
his research to the field of medicine. 
This research led to the invention of 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 

Considered an important advance- 
ment in medical technology, an MRI 
allows doctors to look painlessly inside 
the human body to aid in the diagnosis 
of various diseases. The process begins 
by creating a magnetic field. Radio 
waves arc sent into the body, and die 
response is measured with a computer. 
A detailed image is produced, which 
helps physicians make a diagnosis and 

Dean Gerard Voland, dean of the 

College of Engineering, Technology 
and Computer Science, said that Dr. 
Lauterbur's work has saved millions of 

"[His work) was consumed by the 
desire to improve quality of life," Vo- 
land said. 

Lauterbur himself is particularly 

proud that the details MRI scans are 
capable of producing can correctly di- 
agnose patients, while avoiding unwar- 
ranted, and often complicated, medical 
procedures. 

"The ability to uvoid unnecessary 
procedure is especially gratifying," Dr. 
Lauterbur said. "This particularly in- 
cludes cases where you do not have to 
do surgery." 

Prior to the Sept. 29 banquet, stu- 
dents in engineering, technology and 
computer science had the opportunity to 
attend a job fair where they could meet 
corporate representatives. A dinner fol-

Lauterbur's presentation was 
titled "How Do You Know What To 
Do Next?" He was optimistic thai 
students would come away from the

"]The presentation] is about my 
own path through a sequence of op-

got me to where I am. I hope they'll

Hotel Chain to 
Appear on IPFW 
Campus 

By Stephanie Samples 



IPFW, as well as the surrounding 
area, continues to experience growth, 
most recently in the form of a proposal 
for a hotel on campus. This hotel will 
hopefully bring attention to the cam- 
pus and will provide opportunities (or 
IPFW students. 

Plans for the hotel have yet to be set 
in stone, but will be underway before 
the school year ends. 

"My best guest tor construction to 
begin would be [in] spring of 2007. 
Construction is estimated to be finished 
by the end of the calendar year, mean- 
ing 2007," said Vice Chancellor Walt 
Branson. 

Many hotel chains arc being con- 
sidered for the hotel on campus. 

"We really aren't sure yet about 
which chain, I really can't suy. The ho- 
tel developers arc looking at a couple 
different chains. Wc are looking al a 
full service hotel, one with a restaurant 
and small meeting facilities - some- 
thing like a Holiday Inn or Marriol," 
said Branson. 

The hotel in itself is not part of 
(he university, but Branson hopes the 
university will profit from it being so 

"For the most part, it is standing 
on its own. What we have required 
them to do is work with the hospitality 
management program here at IPFW to 
make opportunities lor internships for 
students. We are viewing it as a lab and 
we have asked them to work with the

"Today is a special day, a day on 
which we honor and congratulate 
members of our university family," 
Chancellor Michael Wartell said as he 
opened the University's Honor Convo- 

The ceremony took place at 2 p.m. 
on Sunday, Oct. 1, in the Hilliard Gates 
Sports Center. It was held to honor 
IPFW students who either earned 
placement on the Dean's List or the Se- 
mester's Honor's List, or who received 
university-related scholarships. 

Wartell recognized several groups 
within the IPFW family, including the 
school's faculty, honoree students and 
their family members. 

Students were individually intro- 
duced by Bruce Kingsbury, professor 
of biology and Karen Ericson. assistant 
professor of chemistry as they crossed 
the front stage to be congratulated by 
Wartell, Vice Chancellor Susan Han- 
nah. Vice Chancellor Edna Neal and

having someone with clinical 
background was a big help." 

Once the three teamed up, 



they hit the ground running and 
applied for grunts lo help fund 
the development of the course. 

"We contacted SENCER,

Welfare Issues Strike Interest How to Deal With Student Stress 



Jenna Jabbering's

After a heated discussion in my

(hough I needed to vent on the issue of 
welfare. In the United States, there are 

many people who

So, shouldn't I

people who use it correctly. 

Being in poverty is nut necessarily 
the fault of those who are in that situ- 
ation. So. shouldn't they continue to 
receive assistance? 

The use of the welfare money is, in 
my opinion, a retlectinn of the parent. 
With the work requirement and the aid 
given depending on location and the 
number of children, eservone should 
be provided for in a welfare family. 
Now, those who feel that the aid is not 
sufficient are likely to not be budget- 
ing well. 

Think about those who are just 
plain set on having children but don't 
have (he means to support them. Is it 
really okay to let (hem have children 
and lo allow the children to suffer be- 
cause we are trying lo prove a point? I 
would say not. 

These people and children have 
feelings, wants, and needs just like 
those of us who are financially-stable 
So, the next lime a discussion comes 
up where welfare is involved, you 
might be tempted to judge or slander.

but there are ways we can handle the 
stress in our lives. I'm going (o (ell 
you a very ironic story and ai the same 
time, I'm going to be informing; you of 
some ways in which we can all relieve 

The other day. I came to The Com- 
municator's office. I had been trying 
to an assignment with the newspaper 
for a couple of weeks now. And fi- 
nally, I had something: an article on 
student stress I must admit thai this 
sparked some interest. But at the same 
time. I really didn't have a whole lot 
to say about the subject. Thai changed 
very quickly. 



My car igmled in Haines the oilier

rently the biggest cause of my sire

tion a few classes My family has been 
great in helping me out for the li: 
ing too. They arc helping me get lo 
school, work, and everywhere else I 
need to be. One of the biggest ways 
of relieving stress is just by allowing 
others to help. That can be difficult at 
times, but it's something that needs to 
be done. 

I enjoy writing. I believe that a 
lot of people do Some people may 
keep a journal or a diary, but person- 
ally. I don'i like those. I like to write 
my problems down in a more poetic 
form. It is something fun and easy to

lo be a great way to get rid of stress. 



I work a third shift job, which can

I realize that my grades may actually he

A lillle hint lo solve thai problem: buy 
a bulletin board and lack the syllabus

you'll get a lot more done. 

Jusl lisiening lo music, sitting back 
and relaxing, and losing yourself is the 
most common and probably the most 
effective way to relieve stress. For

Afterwards, you feel so good that you

Student Fumes on 
Smoking 

By Stephanie Samples 



.- design,] led ■■ 



i for 



The IPFW campus is no dilfcrcnt 
According to the IPFW student hand- 
book. "Smoking is prohibited in any 
university facility and on any univer- 
sity grounds except in parking lots and 
designated smoking areas." 

For someone like me. this policy 
sounds ideal. I hate the smell of smoke 
and don't appreciate smelling like il al! 
day. On the other hand, I can under- 
stand why these rules would be annoy- 
ing to smokers, which is probably why 
most of the rules are not obeyed. 

Smoking inside university build- 
ings is the one rule I have not yet seen 
broken. 

I think it would be safe to assume 
that students would not be able to get 
away with lighting up in class. Howev- 
er, most of the other rules in the univer- 
sity's smoking policy are not followed. 
Students still smoke near the doors of 
building*, and they don't remain in the 
designated smoking areas. 

Don't get me wrong, I am not say- 
ing that smoking needs to be banned 



Policy 

everywhere. If everyone who smokes 
doesn't want to have to stay in the 
shelter areas, feel free to move. I 
would be glad to go in there when its 
raining, and would love to not have to 
smell like smoke. 

People don't smoke in non-smok- 
ing restaurants because they know if 
they do, they will be asked to stop or 

Unfortunately, campus security 
has more important things to do than 
monitor smokers. This makes me won- 
der - is there really a point in having a 
policy that no one really follows? 

People have known for a long time 
that smoking is unhealthy. And over 
the past few years, more and more 
places have banned smoking as a con- 
venience to non-smokers. If a person 
chooses to continue to smoke after all 
of this, it is very unlikely that they will 
slop. This goes for students as well. 
They will smoke wherever they want 
unless they are actually stopped from 

I have many friends who smoke, 
and I don't understand the appeal. 
Nevertheless, as long as the smoke is 
not in my face, I can avoid it. I think 
we should be more concerned about 
the health of the people smoking rath- 
er than their location.

Perhaps I'm the biggest nerd to

to go to the library. 

It took rne'300 words of fluff to 
admit that I'm afraid of a library. It's 
the same reason I didn't go into ihe Li-

a few years ago— which.' while being 
the nation's library, is also (he largest

I mean, I was actually stressing a

I'm not one for allowing my fears 
to rule my life, unless we're talking 
about spiders or clowns. 

I'm not going to let this fear ruin

"On the Twentieth 
Century" Rolls into 
the Station at IPFW 



The musical. "On the Iwenticlh Cenlury" is 
making its Fori Wayne debut ai Williams The- 
atre on Ihe IPFW campus on Oci. 6 and will run 
through Oct.15. 

Set in the An Deco era of the 1930s, on the 
train, the Twentieth Cenlury Limited from Chi- 
cago to New York, this tunny, screwball musical 
opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre on 
February 19. 1978 and ran for 460 performances. 

"On the Twentieth Century" features great 
lyrics and romantic sweeping melodic written by 
Cy Coleman. Betty Comden and Adolph Green. 
Directed by Craig A. Humphrey, with musical di- 
rection by Mindy Cos. the musical is based on the 
play "Twentieth Century,'' which was a successful 
film in the 30s starring John Barrymore and Car- 
ole Lombard. 

On Broadway, the musical version starred 
Madeline Kahn. Imogene Coco. John Cullum and 
Kevin Kline. 

"On the Twentieth Century" depicts the crazed 
antics of a once powerful, now bankrupt theatrical 
producer/director as lie pints to reconcile with 
his ex-lover, a highly successful and temperamen- 
tal Hollywood star. His plans to star her in a lav- 
ish, new stage production and subsequent 
movie, and ride her coat tails hack to the top are 
thwarted when all of them are hoodwinked. 

With most of the mad-cap action taking place 
onboard the train, the department of theatre is 
thrilled to take on this exciting creative chal-

American 
Foreign Policy 



Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2006, 7:30 p.m. 
IPFW Walb Student Union Ballroom 

Seymour Hersh is one of America's finest investigative 
journalists, uncovering some of the most important 
news stories of our times. Hersh discusses the often 
shadowy world where America's official foreign policy 
stance meets the politics and power in other parts of 
the world. He reveals what happens when 
governments seek to operate unhindered by the 
checks and balances of our constitutional system. 

Hersh continues to be one of the most controversial 
and insightful commentators on foreign policy in the 
United States. His reporting goes far beyond headlines 
to the core problems of ideology and personal intrigue 
that drive so much of American foreign policy.
