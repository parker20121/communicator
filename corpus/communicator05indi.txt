For students who arc having trouble 
finding Job, the Job Location Service 
In Hoom 113 of the Walb Memorial 
Union may bcthcsolutlrai. 

"The quality and quantity of Jobs this 
year Is much belter," said Marianne 
Adair, co-director at the Job Location 
Service. "Wcdidn bigger solicllollonlo 
emplo&gt;'cra than ever before and have 
placed about Ml students In Jobs since 
school B I arlPd. 

"This year luc're trying to get a 
babpllting referral service going for 
students who need to leave their 
children someplace for the day." Adair 
said. 

She eiplalned that (he service Is also 
working on linking up with other 
departments so that when a Job Is 
available, Ihe proper department will 
bccontaelcd. 

Other plans for the service ore to 
locate temporary Christmas Jobs for 
students and to provide Inlemahips for 
students inlereslcd in career op- 
portunity Jobs 

The service uses two methods lo help 
students find Jobs and Is available to oil

Hudson enplained there ore two 
reasons work-study students are Hrst 
given Jobs "Oneisihallhe govemmenl 
grants [he school a certain amount of 
money &gt;o they con provide these 
students with Jobs. If the school dotsn'l 
Tind Jobs for them, Ihe grants will be 
lower nenl year, HudsOTi said "The 
second reason Li that lh« cJepartraents 
that have the Job openings only have to 
pay SO percenl of the wagp, " she said. 

"It's really loo bad." Hudson said, 
"that wG can't find cnou,^ Jobs for the 
students not on work -study because we 
realize they have neeit loo. Most 
departments just can't afford to pay 
full wage lo alt of their employees. If o 
student comes in, though, we will try 
hard to place him Ina Jobiiomewhere."

Carol Durham Is enthusiastic about

situations on the Job or in social or 

lamlly setlinp which once left them 

feeling inadequate, Durham sold. 

Durham sold that most of all she 

things they think slop them from doing 
what they want to do, and then she 
wants to icach them how to orercome 
tbcm Identifying those "stDppeni" and 
active participation In discussion and 



role playing to find ways t 
those attitudes and to build self-esteem 
ore basic to learning assertive 
behavior, Durham said, 

Carol Sandler took the classes one 
year ago because she felt she needed 
skills In becoming more- assertive, 
particulorly with men. Mate aulborily 
figures, especially people you go to tor 
help, like your doctor, Sandlcrsald, left 
her feeling like a little g'jl Asser- 
tiveness training helped bij- overcome 
those feelings and left her with a belter 
grasp ol her own self-worth, Santller 
said. She feels she Is now passing that 
skill on lo her clients in her Job as a 
caseworker lor Big EmilherB-Big

Durham and Sandler agree that the 
immediate result of taldng asser* 
tiveness training is increased self- 
image, but they feel the attitude 
changes and the personal growth

At Its Sept 9 meeting, the Student 
Senate heard Ken Schenk. student body

time students' activity fee. 

"Instead of charging Ihe full t-lO for 
the full-time student, hack it to $1 J and 
put some kind of a tax on the parltime 
students," Schenk suggested. 

Schenk called the proposal "a sliding 
scale." He said the parl-dme actlvily 
fee would increase participation al 
activities "since twice as many 
students would have activity cards." 
He also said it would raise as much. If 
not more, revenue. 

Schenk said the time was ripe lo 
pursue a part-time acUvity fee since 
student govenunents at Purdue 
Clalumel and Purdue University al 
Indianapolis arc presently doing so

presented the Idea to Senalclasl spring, 
but it was not considered at that time

"Signs have been tried in the past, 
but we can't enforce them, and the

Another problem brought out In the 
nonsmokers' area discussion was that 
no doors would divide the smoking and 
nonsmoking secUons, and Ihe smoke 
would travel. The proposal was sent to 
the student affairs commlllee for 
further consideration.

Institute fills need for clearinghouse 



By BRYAN' J. BROWN 
Stall Writer 
The Institute for Social and Com- 
munily Research, a new arm of Ihe 
IPFW sociology and anthropology 
dopartmcnl, may be of greal benefit lo 
the students and faculty of IPFW. as 






well ai 






The purpose of the institute is the 
training and placement of students in 
the social sciences, the conductmg of 
research in northeastern Indiana, and 
thefulfillmenlollhe communi ty 's need 
of a clearinghouse for valuable 
sociological data. 

Peter ladieola, professor ol sociology 
at IPFW, Is the impetus behind Ihe 
insUtute. ladieola, who has a doctorate 
degree in sociology and six years 
practical eiperience in social research, 
comes up against the task seemingly 
well prepared. 

He currcnlly is working alongside 



Pat Ashton of the sociology depart- 
ment, in a historical research of Fort 
Wayne's Central Neighborhood 
Association 

"Most people are called upon to in- 
tercept research data wilh llttie or no 
knowledge of how that data is 
gathered," ladieola said. He said this Is 
a problem Ihe insUlule will try to 

"Institutes al other universilies are 
dalafocised, the insUtute at IPFW will 
be student focused, " he said. 

"As the job market for social science 
graduates becomes more competitive, 
the need lo provide our students with 
additional skills in the areas ol applied 
sociology. Including applied research 
and program evaluation, policy 
analysis, community organiution and 
social service management In- 

The research Institute is designed to 
provide ongoing research and com- 
munity work opportunities in which 



ladicD 

In addition lo this training, the in- 
stitute will aid in Ihe occupallonal 
placement of students upon graduation, 
he said, "With the development of a 
closer link between the sociology and 
anthrofiology department and public 
and private agencies and organiiations 
in the community, we will be more 
successful in placing our sludenis In a 
broader range of occupations and

Just as sociology ma Jon

only students called upon to inlerprcl 
data, sociology majors will nol be Ihe 
only students participating and 
benefiting from Ihe insbtule, he said. 
The insUtute will create classes and 
directed research projects thai touch 

For instance, job loss studies and 
economic Indicator statistics may be of 



special interest lo business and 
economics majors; health core studies 
and menial health statistics may tie of 
concern to medical and psychology 
students 

The Institute will deal wilh many 
areas of Uic communlly, giving 
students a vioble link to the surroun- 
ding world, lad I cola said. 

An advUiory board for the Injlllute 
has been appointed and will begin 
working wilh ladieola to develop a 
brochure lo Inform the community 
about the Institute. Members of the 
advisory board Include one an- 
thropologist, Diane Brynon, and four 
socioloBlits, John WhiUock, Patrick 
Ashlon, Scou Shrclner and Judith 01 
lorio 

All members ol Ihe advisory board 
are assistant professors In the 
department ol sociology and an- 
ihropology 



DGTS integrates into other IPFW departments 



DOTS, Ihe Division of General and 
Technical Studies, is no longer a 
separate academic unit of IPFW. The 
DGTS program has been incorporated 
UilooUier IPFW units, elf eclive July 1. 

While a separate DGTS unit nolonger 
exists, ils programs havcbeen retained 
and BO percent ol its students sUU have 
classa that meet a I IPFTV's Ban- 
Street locaUon. 

Students who enroll in the DGTS 
program are now a pari of community 
outreach iransiUonal studies, and they 
have the choice of working toward one- 
year certificates or two-year associate 
degrees. And because DGTS students 
are now a pari of Ihe regular IPFW 
units, they can later exoand their 



certiTicates or associate degrees to 
four-year degrees. 

The classes formerly listed within the 
DGTS unit are now integrated inio 
corresponding dqiartments and units 
on the main campus For instance,

Thc curriculum for DGTS sludenis 
has been modified slightly, said Wade 
FVedrich, assisUint director ol Ihe 
DGTS program Students In the 
programs arc now required to take 
courses such as psychology, math and 
English composition, for instance, but 



le added courses will enhance the 
sluaenls' U-ansferahility if they chocse 
to go on wiUi their studies, Fredrick 

The DGTS program here has an 
enrollment of 1.000 students, and the 
associate classes are all full, Fredrick 



According lo BIckley, "Moat of the 
DGTS program's classes witl be on the

The Developmental Skills Center is 
offering a program for adults who are 
returning to college after being away 
from the scholasUc world for a number 
of years The prc^am is called 
Reluming Adult Place I RAPl 

The purpose of RAP is to help 
returning adults become oriented 10 
college life, according to Valll Pherson, 
developmental skills specialist in 
charge of BAP. "Most of the returning 
adults have been away from school so 
long that Ihcy need some help getting 
back into the swing of things." Pherson 

She explained thai RAP holds a 
special orienlaticii progrwn for 
returning adults each sonester. At the 
orientaUon, a panel of returning adult 
students, usually juniors and seniors, 
Ulk about some of the difficulties they 
experienced wbeo they first returned to 
college, Pherson said. A panel of 
faculty also participate in the orien- 

Each September and FebrAary, BAP 
hosts shori study skills presentadoiB. 
Pherson said. She explained thai tbe 
organization also [lints a monthly 
newsietler 



Monthly meetings also used to be 
offered by RAP, according lo Pherson. 
but they were curtailed because of poor 
attendance. "Most of the returning 
adults ore married," Pherson said. 
"They have children and full-time jobs. 
They jist don't have time to attend 
meetings too " She explained that the 
ne-A-sletter is going to be lengthened In 
order Lo make up for the absence of the 
monthly meetings. 

RAP was IniUaled by the translUonal 
studies dcparlmenl in the tall of 1977. 
"We began RAP because we fell there 
was a need for a special program for 
reluming adults." Pherson said. 
"Many of tbe returning adults were in 
my reading and study skills class so I 
was aware of the special problems 
confronting them." 

The enrollment of reluming adult 
students has Increased steadily at 
IPFW, Emerson said, adding that she 
feels the interest in RAP has also In- 
creased. "Our newsletter has a large 
drculalion," she said. "More people

The Intentions or Ihe students who have

received as a rev eta Hon 
from one of the best rock 
bands In the world. More 
recently, however, cribcs 
seem lo demand proof that 
Ihey still deserve their 
reputation after 19 )-ears 
together 

This usually leads (o a 
controvGrsy, Tired with 
superlatives on both sides, 
over whether or nol they sUU 
have what II lakes. This is 
the ease with the lalesi 
Stones release, "Tattoo

"TbIIoo You" has been 



goodfll 



extraordinary thing thai 
some people seem to wish for 
it For Instance, 11 is no 
more, II as much, satisFying 
than "Some Girls." 

It is also on exaggeration 
to say that "Tattoo You" Is a 
return lo the lype of music 
the Stones played In the '60s. 
These are the 'BOs. and a

tone is set by "Worried

high point of the side Is 
"Waiting For A Friend,"

Jarreau's approach balanced 



By STEVE CON'LEV 

One ol the most difficuli 
tasks any ortist who has 
Dchlcvcd a measure of 
success Faces is to continue 
to Innovate and progress. 

Tills Is especially true In 



ceptance oI a unique trend 
engenders a multitude oF 
splnofFs and the original 
trendsetter Is expected to 
produce more oF the same. 

With his new album, 
"Breakin' Awoy," vocalist 
Al Jarrcau has skillfully 
balanced a desire For ex- 
posure to wider oudiences 
and an Innate aesthetic drive 
expand his musical 



m follows his 



highly successful 1680 disc, 
"This Time." Both albums 
have been produced and 
arranged by two long-time 
asEoclales oF Jarrcau's, Jay 

guitarist, and keyboard 
player Tom Canning. The 
trio compose d the bulk of 
original material found on 
Jarreau'a albums, and the 
new songs on "Breakin' 
Away" are indicative oF 
their conlinuing ingenuity 
and craftsmanship. 

Chie especially pleasant 
Facet of Jarreau' 



Jarreau's and the sincerity 
is obvious. Tills Is nol to say 
that A] is not capable of 
romantic love songs. On the 
contrary, many of his Fans 
feel thai passionate songs 
his torle, as In the Joyous

maturity ol his lyrics. For 
inslancc,lhe first cut onslde 
one dispenses with trlle 
melodrama lies and qulle 



"We're 
Together.' 

Side two opens wiin tne 
blockbuster title cut. 
"Breakin' Away." Jarreau 
really breaks new ground 
musically on this one with a 
sophisticated, yel danceable 



harmonic progression and 
soaring Falsetto vocal. 

The high spirited "Roof 
Garden" Is the Ideal parly 

inclined to "cut the rug" at 
theirnext shindig. , 

Jarrcau has a penchant for 
adding lyrics to Jaii stan- 
dards, as with Chick Corea's 
Immortal "Spain," and now 
with a rendition of Dave 
Bru beck's "BlueRondo." 

All this and a soulful 
version oF the classic ballad 
"Teach Me Tonight" exhibit 
Jarreau's determination to 
Forge new musical avenues 
while simultaneously 
acknowledging and 
rejuvenating tradillonal 
masterpieces. This Is music
