year, NAMI Fon Wayne hopes to raise S30,000 and 
achieve a turn out of over 50 walking teams. There arc 
already 25 corporate sponsors registered for Satur- 



day's walk. 

'One of our goals wiih NAMIWalks is to educate 
the public about the need for an effective mental 
health system," says Katby Bayes, NAMI Tort Wayne 
executive director. 'When people have access to the 
services and support they need to stay well, our en- 
tire community is healthier and stronger.' 

Everyone is welcome to join and although regis- 
tration is not required, it can be done before Satur- 
day's event on NAMI's website at www.nami.org/ 
namiwalks/IN/FW. [&gt;articipants can walk in a team, 
join an existing team, or walk as an individual. Teams 
can create their own personal website for support- 
ers to make donations to, or supporters can donate 
through the NAMI website. 



If you have ever 
placed a bet or played 
a card game for money, 
you have gambled. Most 
everyone throughout 
history has done so and 
thought nothing of it. 
Gambling has become so 
commonplace in today's 
society that "We no lon- 
ger see it or hear it." said 
Vice Chancellor for Slu- 
dent Affairs, Dr. George 
S. McClellan. 

McClellani who spoke 
at the Double Down 
Blues: College Student 
Gambling lecture held 
by tlie Anthropology 
club last Wednesday, has 
studied, presented and 
written about student 
gambling since 1995. 

"It is our cullure," 
McClellan said, adding 
that college students are 
among the fastest grow- 
ing gambling popula- 
tions. He pointed this 
fact out by showing pic- 
tures, one of which was 
an advertisement to 
gamble for tuition mon- 
ey, another showing the 
University of Tennessee's 
logo in the middle of a 
poker table. 

As a reality check in 
the middle of his lec- 
ture. McClellan asked the 
audience to raise their 
hands and lower them 
only if they had taken 
part in anything that he 
mentioned. .Mter five 
simple questions, all of 
which had to do with 
gambling in one form or 
another, everyone had 
lowered their hand. Mc- 
Clellan said that every 
once in awhile he will 
have one person left over 
who had not gambled. 
When he would ask the 
non-gambler how hel 
she fell about that, they 
would usually respond 





with words like "lonely," 
or "embarrassed." 

"What game you play 
in or what size your bet 
is, is the new cool, " said 
McClellan. mentioning 
that cven.v "Rock stars 
want to be poker stars 
now." And that is very 
true, with celebrities 
such as Tobey Maguire. 
Ben Affleck and Shannon 
Elizabeth showing their 
skills. 

Though McClellan 
clearly stated that he was 
not persuading anyone 
to be for or against gam- 
bling, he seemed to be 
speaking against gam- 
bling tlie whole time. He 
did this through telling 
his audience the odds 
of the games and details 
of the downfalls some 
people encountered due 
to gambling. Neverthe- 
less, he never made any- 
one feel as if they were 
heading down a bad path 
by purchasing a lottery 
ticket or entering a poker 
tournament. 

Mainly, the thought 
diat he w^s trying to get 
across w^s that gambling 
is not alwaj-s just fun and

"There is a counter- 
narrative to the narrative 
of success." said McClel- 
lan, when he was inform- 
ing the audience of many 
people who had taken 
their oivn lives because 
of gambling debt. "We 
have embraced the gam- 
bling narrative. ..and not 
the counter-narrative." 

So, when exactly have 
we reached the point 
where we are gambling 
too much? The answer 
can be many times un- 
clear. Maybe it is when 
we feel the urge to buy 
lottery tickets with mon- 
ey that we need to save. It 
might be when we travel 
across country just to go 
to a casino. More likely, 
when we can no longer 
stay in college or sup- 
port ourselves because of 
growing gambling debts; 
each has their own low. 

In closing. McClellan 
left us ivith three ques- 
tions to ponder. "What 
can you do about all of 
this? What should &gt;t)u 
do about all of this? And 
what will do you about 
all of this?'

CAMPUS ATHEISTS 
AND AGNOSTICS 

Non-religious students 
at IPFW have a voice 



Should students play a bigger 
role in the health care debate? 



By Peter Schnellenberger 



On a campus whei^ 
nine difTereni student 
run organizations seek 
lo promote religion and 
spirituality. A single 
collection of students 
stand together raising 
the forbidden question, 
'Does God exist?" 

Campus Atheists and 
Agnostics is a newly rec- 
ognized student orga- 
nization, whose explicit 
purpose is to 'create a 
safe and welcoming en- 
vironment for students 
who are open to think- 
ing skeptically about re- 
li^otis claims.' said the 
organization's Presideni 
Brad Butierbaugh. 

'The real reason I 
wanted to start it is be- 
cause on this campus. 
die large majority of 
students who subscribe 
10 religious beliefs have 
multiple opportuni- 
ties to for socializing 
and groups.' said But- 
ierbaugh. He helped 
found the otganiiation 



so thai there would be 
an opportunity for non- 
religious students to 
have someplace to go to 
socialize. 

Buitcrbaugh also 
noted that Campus 
Atheists and Agnostics 
is not j'usl for the non- 
religious, it's for who- 
ever wants lo speak 
their mind in a safe and 
non-judgmental atmo- 
sphere. Butierbaugh 
pointed out that there 
is even a Lutheran min- 
ister who regularly at- 
tends meetings. 

On September 28. 
Campus Atheists and 
Agnostics hosted an 
event for national blas- 
phemy day promoting 
free speech: they set up 
a table in [he Science 
MaU and asked students 
to write whatever they 
wanted, religious or not. 
on a board that they 
provided. Butierbaugh 
noted how impressed 
he ^s'as at the turn out 
and the discussions thai 
toot place during the 
event.

As the health care 
debate persists, college 
studenis continue to hnd 
themselves left in ihe 
dark and may be igno- 
rant or indiffereni as to 
how the debate affects 
them or whai their cur- 
rent options are. 

A repon conducted 
by the United States 
Governmeni Accouni- 
abilir\' Office found that 
approximately 20 per- 
cent of college students 
are uninsured. Though 
this may seem like a low 
number, a majority of 
insured students are cov- 
ered by another person's 
policy, such as by being 
dependents on parents' 
policies. 

Many students are 
young and currently 
healthy may believe that 
health insurance is not 
a priorit&gt;' or for ihem. 
Others may feel iniimi- 
daied or are jaded by the 
process of learning about 
and acquiring health 

*i did IfoUow the 
health care debate] to an 



e.&lt;cient but it just goes on 
and on and I lost inter- 
est in following it." IPFW 
student Ronald Ramsey 
said. "I think I have 
some ihealih insurancel 
through the university 
but none that 1 actually 
started or pay for." 

The Student Injury 
and Sickness Insurance 
Plan was what Ramsey 
\vas referring to. which 
has a premium rate of 
S1,58G. This plan is de- 
signed for smdents of 
Purdue University, and 
according to die 2009- 
2010 brochure, it is a 
blanket student plan 
and contains limited 
benefits. Twelve months 
of previous continuous 
coverage is required to 
avoid denied claims for 
pre-existing conditions. 
No lapse between plans 
may occur. 

Having this option 
provided by the univer- 
sity can be very helpful 
and convenient to many 
students. However it 
also imposes barriers on 
those who have ne^er 
had health care before 
or had a "lapse bcnveen 
plans," such as if a parent 
recendy lost their job or 
health care coverage. 



Other students may 
have parents who will 
eventually lose their 
health care coverage due 
to job losses or because 
of other economic fac- 
tors. Students may also 
be entering a stage in life 
where they are no longer 
eligible under their par- 
ents' plans. 

"As of now I do not 
care about health care 
because as a student I 
am still covered on my 
parents' Ihealih care 
planl,' IPFW student 
Adam Hawthorne said. 
"NexlyearwhenI tum24 
I will have to get my own 
and if 1 have not gradu- 
ated yet and have no job 
I will have to buy my own 
insurance." 

Indiana Represen- 
tative Mark Souder be- 
lieves that while many 
struggle with the cost of 
health care, most unin- 
sured college students 
at IPFW are not low-in- 
come- 

'Hn students, par- 
ticularly those students 
who weni back to school 
and are giving up income 
so they're working on a 
different income level 
then now trying to ab- 
sorb health care, (then! 



that should've been fac- 
tored in as part of the op- 
portunity cost in going lo 
college." Souder said. 

Instead of incorporat- 
ing college students Into 
H.R. 3200, Souder would 
be more in favor of an 
Association Health Plan. 
According to Souder. this 
would be a plan that ex- 
tends across state lines, 
which would cut costs. 
These states would have 
more trimmed-down 
policies, and students 
could instead buy inex- 
pensive plans such as 
catastrophic health in- 
surance. 

"Every day, one in 
three young adults who 
don't have healtii insur- 
ance live one accident 
or one illness away from 
bankruptcy." President 
Barack Obama said in a 
speech at the University 
of Maryland. "Nearly 40 
percent are in debt be- 
cause of them Imedical 
expensesl." 

Regardless of where 
one stands on Ihe spec- 
Irum of the heatlh care 
debate, ii is apparent 
thai students should not 
be alienated from the de- 
bate and need to be more 
educated.

"Most households continue to give 
during times of financial insecurity," 
the report stated, "although some give 
less compared to periods of economic 
prosperity and some donors become 
non-donors, especially those earning 
less than $50,000 peryear". 

In 2009 the center reported tiiat the

Borders Gets Free WIEI 



By Craig Lloyd 

uJlbrFttaone39giTuil com 

'Monkey see, monkey do' is 
an old adage describes the game that 
i.nternatjonal bookstore franchise Bor- 
ders has been playing with its fierce 
competitor Barnes and Noble for quite 
some time.Addingcoftee shops, selling 
CDs ai ungodly prices and eating away 
ai smaller bookstores are just a few 
things thai Borders took from BSiN's. 

To add to this. Borders has now 
teamed up ivitii Verizon to offer free 
WiFi to all of its patrons, jusi a couple 
months after Barnes and Noble an- 
nounced that they would be giving up 
WiFi subscription fees in full. 

Even more, Borders will be cre- 
ating a splash page (thanks to Verizon's 
platform) that users first see when they 
log on to the free WiFi. This gives the 
bookstore the opportunity to feature 
news such as new music and books. 
special discounts and the opportunity 
to join the Borders Rewards program. 

Borders will be offering the free 
\Vi¥\ service in most of its more than 
500 stores nationwide by mid-October 
This should give you a litde bit of time 
to polish your Macintosh notebook and 



pick out your favorite scarf and pair of 
tight pants so you can look extra hip for 
die free WiFi debut around your fellow 
hipsters. 

"By offering free Wi-Fi, we are ex- 
tending the open atmosphere' oFexplo- 
ration that is at the core of every great 
bookstore experience and furthering 
the sense of community we have al- 
ways fostered at Borders," said Bor-

Roommate's Pick: Pearl Jam 



By Mark Cox 



Honestly. 1 went into listening 
to this album skeptical as I have 
with other albums liiis year with 
Backspacer from grunge and hard 
rockband Pearl Jam. Likeodierbands 
that were hot in the 90's and still 

Eroducing well into die ZOOO's they 
ave Iricdlo rejuvenate llicir sounds 



lo somewhat of what's popular now 
and have actually succeeded in 
producing a good sound with ne^v 
wave sound and pop. I never really 
liked Pearl l^m to begin with, but this 
is a pretty sound album. "The Fixer- 
is a good tr.ick that's upbeat and has 
a new wave sound that includes their 
usually sounds plus powerful sound 
and even piano work. 

Sure, their vigor and intense 
cliord work isn't as epic and angered 



as when they first started writing 
songs, bur they can still produce 
a good sound without complctelv 
conforming to new age sound. 
Like other bands they have started 
making really slow and mellow songs 
to put on their albums, which isn't 
necessarily a bad thing. 

I cannot exactly point out an 
exact group of bands that this 
new albums resembles, although 
I did hear a little bit of sound and 



vocals that reminded me of ^uq^ 
'ol Kings of Leon in their career, and 
unfoTTunaicly 'The Eiut^'&lt;tounck!;a 
bit too much like Randy Newinan:^ 
and that's not a compliment, but 
nobody can like every single track on 
an album. 'Just Breathe" is another 
song that I recommend a listen tp. 
This is a very mellow track that h^ 
a great message between a man ami 
a woman, as well as "Amongst tl^ 
Waves." ■•

AFI is one of those 
bands that had a strong, 
almost cult-like, follow- 
ing back in the day and 
(as is typical with ebtist 



fansi as they were signed 
to a major label, lost a 
majority of theirolder fol- 
lowers, or course, there 
were a solid few that were 
steadfast with their band 
in their loyalties but for 
the most pan, the origi- 
nal fans abandoned ship. 

Crash Love is a br cry 
from anything AFI has 
ever put out before. Not 
even fragments of Anjii/er 
Tliat and Siay Fashion- 
able or The Art ofDrown- 
ingare to be found within 
this piece, however, it is 
not all that bad. 

There is nothingabout 
this album that overtly 
screams 'punk rock,' 
however, front-man and 
vocalist Dave&gt;- Havok has 
always had a very iden- 
tifiable \T3ice and diat 
holds true for this album. 
It seems as though v^ith 
every release he is trying 
new things v.ith his voice. 
In the opening track en- 
nded 'Torch Song." Havok 
creates a strange influx 



of curling his voice at the 
end of certain words and 
phrases. Some tracks in- 
volve his triumphant wail 
crafted around guitar so- 
los; some have haunting 
whispering chants with 
growingly intense call 
backs -- intricately craft- 
ed indeed. 

Setting Havok's voice 
aside, the album has 
its downfalls. For one, 
it falls into a nu-metal 
radio rock trap that six 
or seven years ago, AFI 
would have never been 
caught dead in. This is 
what makes the album 
intensely hit or miss. 
Tracks like 'End Trans- 
mission' and 'Veronica 
Sawyer Smokes' provide 
windows to the old AFI. 
Shaded, verj- tinted and 
dusted windows, but 
windows nonetheless. 

The tracks that bore 
no impact sadly made 
this [us[ another typical 
radio disaster waiting to 
happen. 



The Swellers: Ups and

Sounds Like: Pes-

Bating: 3/5 




From track one 
this album gives the 
impression that The 
Swellers really have tl 
together. The harmo- 



nizing between vocal- 
ists is fantastic, the 
percussion is upbeat 
and energetic, and 
each individual in ihc 
band has a feel for how 
each other musician 
in the band works. 
This is very evident 
through the entirety 
of the listening experi- 

As is typical with a 
lot of 'pop-punk' albums 
these days, some of the 
songs seem to be a litde 
repetitive and go on for 
way longer than what it 
seems they should. This 
is not entirely detrimen- 
tal to the album, but it 
makes replay value de- 
crease pretty drastically. 

Though the harmo- 
nizing is good, the vo- 
cals themselves sound a 
little generic and similar 
to just about every other 
pop-punk group thai 
came out in tile last six or 



seven years. Not lo say it 
isn't enjoyable, it just Isn'i 
unique. Nothing overtly

Last T\iesday night. 
a not so rare event oc- 
curred; a music act came 
to Bloominglon, Indiana. 
Suljan Stevens played 
a[ the Buskirk Chumley 
Theatre right near the ItJ 
campus. A little known 
band called Cryptacize 
opened the show with 
sultry, yet sometimes 
nff-key. sounds. Singer 
Nedelle Torrisi sounds 
like a mixture between 
singers Rachael Vam a ga- 
la and Regina Spektor. 
Most of their songs told 
stories and they were 
challengingly artlul. 

Then, Su^an came 
oul on stage. He wore a 
cowboy hat and each of 
his band members were 
wearing his tour l-shirts. 
Me looks much differ- 
ent in person than he 
docs in his music videos 
or pictures. Some press 
photos have made him 
look very eccentric, but 
on the stage, perform- 
ing new and old songs, 
he looked like a college 
student. Even though he 
is thirty- four, adoring fe- 
male fans wouldn't know 
it. While he defied his 
normal pp^e^rance for 
the night, nis new songs 
were more emotional 
and seemed to be more 
about love than aniihing 
else. 

While some of his 
songi, such as "To Be 
Alone With You" or "Chi- 
cago" focus on deep is- 
sues, like doing anything 



for someone you love, or 
making a good share of 
mistakes, he did focus 
the audience back to the 
premise of inspiration. 
During a song break, he 
told the story about how 
his parents thought he 
should be a lawyer or 
pursue a job that would 
alivays be in demand. 
Sufjan shook his head 
and told the crowd how 
he disappointed his fam- 
ily by choosing to be an 
artist. But. he said an 
artist is forever. The "art 
is forever" commentary 
had the audience burst- 
ing into applause. 

It seems Sufjan has a 
specific demographic of 
followers. Although peo- 
ple of all ages and dis- 
positions attended the 
show, many of the peo- 
ple looked particularly 
"artsy." While Bloom- 
inglon is a college town. 
most of the people wait- 
ing in line were younger 
and quite "hip" by this 
season's supposed fash- 
ion standards. Yuppies 
in broivn leather jack- 
ets and knit golfing hats 
stood in line; while oth- 
ers were middle-aged 
parents ivith dumpy 
looking 80s jackets and 
receding hairlines. 

All in all. Sufjan 
played a quality show 
for his adoring fans, 
who weren't afraid to 

Kell out that they loved 
im whenever he look a 
quick break from play- 
ing. To find out more

Urinetown Review 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

uhnpJOl Chludtnli Ipfwrdu 



"This Is noi a happy musical." said 
Officer Lockstock, played by senior 
Aaron Mann. Alongside Lillle Sally, 
played by junior Cale Deventer, ihe 
duo Inlcrmittcntly narrated and gave 
satirical commentary about what was 
happening Ihroughoul "Urinetown, 
Tlic Musical". 

To say that this production empha- 
sizes the part of any single cast mem- 
ber over the other would be a blalani 
lie. Each one of the 17 members of 
the cast plays an integral role in each 
of the various scenes. Granted not ev- 
ery character played has a plethora of 
tines, but almost alt Ihe cast members 
are onstage for nearly every scene. 

Audience members who came to 
see "How to Succeed in Business with- 
out Really TVying" last year may recog- 
nize some stylistic parallels, one being 
the almost canoonish feel that they 
both shared. But not the same kind of 
cartoon that they mimic, "How to Suc- 
ceed..." was similar lo Disney cartoon, 
while "Urineloivn" was reminiscent of 
one of Tim Burtons stop action clayma- 
lion's such as "The Nightmare Before 
Christmas". It's not astonishing that 
tliese shows share similarities because 
they are rooted in the vision of the man 
who directed them, Craig Humphrey. 



Although Humphrey successfully 
cast the show with actors who were 
ideal for their roles and had the vocal 
capabilities to fulHIl their characters, 
the venue, however, could not accom- 
modate the sheer vocal power that the 
cast produced. On several occasions 
throughout the production five pan 
harmonies were belted with maximum 
force, unfortunately the lyrics spoken 
were rendered inaudible, because the 
space is loo confined. 

Another low point was the misuse of 
the stage itself, something that occurs 
during most productions in William's 
Theatre. William's Theatre is a thrust 
stage, which means the audience sur- 
rounds three-quarters of the stage. 
Most productions in the space are 
staged to fit a proscenium theatre, like 
that of The Fort Wayne Civic Theatre 
and The Embassy Theatre. Designing 
a show this way is a problem because 
only the audience members seated di- 
recUy in front of the stage get played to, 
which means the other uvo thirds of 
the audience see the actor's backs the 
entire show, a grave offense to theatre 
goers everywhere. 

Overall the production was a suc- 
cess, like a well oiled machine and a 
story whose message is peninent to to- 
day, especially with the climate of the 
healthcare debate being as heated as it 
is. The cast, crew and production staff 
should alt be proud.

Basketball trick shot team becomes online sensation 



By Katy Ralston 



Texas A&amp;M students brought a new 
meaning to the shot heard round ihe 
world. In this case it's with a basketball. 

Seniors Coby and Cor&gt;' Coilon. both 
communication majors, Garrett Hil- 
bert. a senior architecture major, Cody 
Jdnes, a senior finance and real estate 
major.TVlerToney, a junior wildlife and 
fjghcries major, and Sean Townsend. 
class of '09 and a current Texas Tech 
graduate student, make up the basket- 
ball trick shot team Dude Perfect. 

Dude Perfect has sensationalized 
the Web, appeared on national news 
stations such as ABC and CBS, and was 
even featured on ESPN sports shows 
"Around the Horn," "Sports CenterTop 
10," "Sports Nation," "First Take" and 
"Pardon the Intemipiion:" attention 
Toney said he never expected. 

"Once we came out with the first 
video we didn't expect anything lo 
happen, and we definitely didn't ex- 
pect everything that has happened to 
the degree that it has," Toney said. 

Dude Perfect started as six col- 
lege roommates betting each other 
sandwiches on scored baskets in their 
backyard. The group soon decided to 
capture their unconventional shots on 
camera. But it didn't stop there. 

After brainstorming and spend- 
ing one afternoon at Toney's ranch. 
Dude Perfect produced a ranch edi- 
tion of basketball irick shots. With two 
of the members spending the summer 
as counselors at the Christian-based 
camp Sky Ranch, a summer camp edi- 
tion was bom. Posted on Youtube, the 



videos sky-rocketed lo success. 

Their videos ha\'e made a splash, 
raised the roof, and gone the diSTancc 
- Uterally. 

The tricLs include goals scared 
while wakeboarding on Styrofoam be- 
hind a four-wheeler, baskets made up 
and over rooftops, and swishing the 
world's longest basketball shot from 
the third deck of Kyle Field. 

Debate has been raging over the 
authenticity of the videos, but Dude 
Perfect's philosophy has been "just 
because it's hard doesn't mean it's im- 



saidlbney. the shooter behind the Kyle 
Field shot. 

"It's actually more of football than 
basketball. I played quarterback in 
hi^ school so I think that's what helps 
more than any basketball skills I might 
have. Especially the long throws, that 
is pretty much all football throivs, just 
with a basketball," Toney said. 

The Dude Perfect videos have so far 
drawn 3.3 million views, and the group 
has found a way to turn this unexpect- 
ed attention into a gulden npjiortimiiy. 

"After the suiiimiT i.inui edition.

possible.' 

"We love it when people say it's fake 
because it makes the shots seem even 
more ridiculously impossible; and we 
get more publicity and hits and You- 
'I\jbe so we love tlie mystery of knowing 
whether it's real or fake," lones said. 

The guys average 15 tries for each 
made basket, wilh some of the shots. 
such as the Cloud Shot on the Ranch 
edition and the Golf Can Shot on the 
Summer Camp edition, being made on 
the lirst try. 

The secret is all in the technique. 



we were like 'listen what can we do' be- 
cause we arc makJng money off of the 
hits we are getting, Wc have to do some- 
thing with it, so we did our research, 
prayed about it and found Compassion 
International," Jones said. 

A Christian-based child advocacy 
organization focused in poverty-strick- 
en nations. Compassion International 
provides health care, hygiene training, 
suppicmenlary food and educational 
opportunities to each individually 
sponsored child. 

For every 100,000 views of the sum- 



mer camp edition the Dude Perfect 
team pledged tu sponsor one child 
through Compas.sion International. 

Dude Perfect's ministry plans do 
not stop there. The group wants to have 
a mon hands-on in\i&gt;l\iiutiu with 
kids and sharing tht'u l.nili wiih iln'm. 

"Wc want to take this f.uiif, -u wli.u- 
evcr you want to cull it. and use li hu 
something other than ourselves. If you 
ask any of us we will (ell you it's not 
about us,* Toney suld. 'It's about using 
tills opportunity to show others thai It 
doesn't always hnve to be about you. 
Tliere an; plenty of ways lo use what 
God has given you in do something 
other than glorify youreelf." 

The learn has even talked about 
slatting iheir own organisation. 

'What we are n&gt;a1ly about is show- 
uig youth and parents that you don'l 
have lo party and drink and go cnizy ull 
ihe lime with your free lime; you can 
huild fellowship and have a blast doing 
it," lones said, 

Dude Perfect has a few inoa' tricks 
up their sleeve, with coming allnicllons 
in the works, including one shoi from 
an airplane moving 65 mph, a celebrity 
edition with iheir recently expanded 
network of connections, and an Fast 
Coast/West Coast monument edition 
sinking shots around the coasts' fa- 
mous landmarks, 

"Even though all of us arc pretty 
much graduating this year we still want 
it to last after college for a little bit," 
Hilbert said. "We don't rcally know liow 
that is going lo happen hut with the di- 
rection wc are wanting to take It, sup- 
porting kids and continuing this min-

Womens Soccer Successful Weekend 



By Oliver Kook 

obnduMitagmiil torn 



The IPFW Women's Soccer team 
won both home conference matches 
this weekend improving this season's 
record to 3-5-1. With the first win of 
Ihe season on Sept. 27, the girls came 
in head strong to the first conference 
match of the year, but ll was Makell 
Southworth who scored the first goal 
of Ihe game for the Southern Utah 
I'hunderbirds after only four minutes. 

Not impressed by the early goal, the 
Mastodons kept their composure and 
answered witli a game tying goal from 
Lisa Underwood a couple minutes 
later. 

Supponcd by II'FWs fans that 
changed their blue IPFW attire to pink 
to raise awareness for breast cancer 
at the Hafner Stadium, the Women's 
Soccer team conlrolted the game for 
the remaining 75 minutes. It was the 
strong defense around senior Tammi 
Kerr, AH Okihlro, Lauren McCrackcn, 
and lustine LcBlanc thai stopped every 
attempt for the Thunderbirds to gel 
into a good position to take a shot at 
the IPFW goal. 

Winning the vast majority of 
duels in the midfield as well, IPFW 
kept possession of the ball to put ihe 
forwards. Britlni Roy and Tara OToolc 
kept the goalkeeper busy, tiring shots 
at any given opportunity until it was 
Usa Underwood again who scored the 
game winning goal after 60 minutes of 
playing time with a strong shot from 
around ten yards from the goal. 

The IWasiodons played with high 
intensity throughout the entire match, 
outrunning theThunderbirds, showing 
that the effon ihey put in daily practice 
now finally pays off. Also mentionable 



was the great energ)' that the players 
from (he bench brought into the game 
when substituted. Playinga great garni- 
Friday night, McCracken concluded 
on the win, "It feels great to be on a 
winning streak. Finally! We have been 
so close in every game this season 
that the losses have been really tough 
on us. Bui we have turned the tables 
and are creating our own luck through 
hard work in every training session and 
game." 

The Women's Soccer team 
continued the winning streak two 
days later on Sunday at noon with the 
second conference game of the season 
against the UMKC Kangaroos. 

The game started off without 
mentionable actions for the first half 
hour until Roy who received a nice 
pass right in front of the 18 yard box, 
assisted with a playbook-like heel trick 
to Arianna Mason who scored her first 
goal in an IPFWjersey to give the Dons 
the lead. 

The Kangaroos tried very hard to 
get back in the game firing a total of 
six shots at the goal, but it was Kristen 
McFadden who made four great saves 
for Ihe Dons keeping the goal clean For 
the match. 

With 15 minutes left in the game, 
Brittany Ciimmons got a hold of the 
ball in the midfield, carried it towards 
the goal before assisting to O'Toole. 
who scored the second and final goal of 
the match. Tara led the offense for the 
Mastodonswith six shots, four shots on 
goal, and her second goal of the season. 

'These two wins should give us the 
confidence that we need as we move 
further into conference play," said 
O" Toole 

T he game concluding a very 
successful weekend for IPFW Women's 
Soccer.

Senior leader works hard to play hard 




By Monica Gerdeman 



You may tind her dressed 
in pink, at Red Robin, eating 
a Slake, or at home watching 
the Desperate House Wives 
marathon with her mom, but 
on the coun this 60" student 
athlete plays nothing but the 
game. 

With a strict motto of 
"Work hard Play hard," out- 
side hitter Rebekah Roehm 
demonstrates a natural se- 
nior leadership. When the 
team is down, look no far- 
ther than Roehm to pick the 
Volleydons back up and put 
them on their feet. 

"It's really a fun think (0 
play (in college.) I've met a 
bunch of my closest friends 
through the game that I 
wouldn't have without it, but 
it's a lot of work. I would say 
make sure you want it before 
you play, and stay organized,' 
advised the senior. 

Choosing IPFW for its lo- 
cation, Roehm also traveled 
to Fort Wayne witha longtime 
friend and teammate, Jamie 
Schwartz who is also a senior

My Scholarship was 
Above: Rebekah Roehm with a bump up a huge reason of choos- 



ing iPFW, but il's also dosi- 
(o home, and home would 
probably have tn be my favor- 
ite place lo be.' commented 
Roehm. 

Coming from a larger fam- 
ily, Roehm is one of sU sib- 
lings, with three older and 
Hvo younger sisters. 

"Every one of my sisters 
played (volleyball) in high 
school, so I was interested 
from the start. My mom also 
played a big pan in teaching 
me a lot about work ethic She 
gave me the "work your hard- 
est" way of life that I still use 
today." she said. 

[n a recent game with 
Wright Slate, Roehm struck 
her career high in kUJs with 
26. She leads the team with 
259 on the year, and has a ca- 
reer total of 1,295. 

At the half-way point of 
the season, Roehm has 12 
more regular season games 
to play with her fellow team- 
mates, and eight more in 
front of a home crowd. 

Roehm said that this sea- 
son is a bit of a shaky one. 
They have some really good 
wins, but there were some 
loses that they shouldn't 
have had. She is looking for 
a strong finish lo her fourth 
and final season.
