HR 4437 



As the United States Senate 
begins to hear debate over 
new (ough laws against illegal 
immigration. hundreds of 
thousands have taken to the 
streets in protest. These new laws 
arc designed to punish companies 
that employ illegal workers in tin-. 



In Los Angeles, an area where 
the bills would strike especially 
hard, an estimated 2 1 , 975 students 
took to the streets to peacfully 
protest these new laws. They 
were in protest of aspects of the 
laws that would carry very harsh 
pen.illics fur illrg.il workers, hiring 
of illegal workers and smuggling of 
humans into the nation. Despite 
the massive crowds and traffic- 
stopping marches, the protests 






stayed peaceful. 

The 
Committee, meanwhile. 
passed legislation that will 
allow currently- illegal aliens to 
obtain citizenship without going 
through the proper channels. 
The legislation will also prevent 
criminal penatlies for illegals 
found in America. The issue goes 
to vote in the full Senate on March

coach back. We're pretty excited about next 
year. The way we ended, I think that's 
mainly why we're excited to see what's 
going to happen next year." 

The only drawback of the 5-1 finish 
was that there wasn't more basketball to 
be played and the team was finally finding 
a rhythm and having fun while playing, 
. IPFW will have to wait eight months before 
getting back on the court for regular season 
competition. 

"You still have that winning streak kind 
of going on and you just want to continue 
it," Lewis-Carlisle said. "But you get back in 
the gym and maybe we can have some new 
people in and get some new stuff going." 



Paul won his second game as coach then 
lost 12 straight before the impressive finish 
over the final six games. He said it took the 
players time to adjust to his styleof coaching 
because it differs from that of Patterson's. 
Paul emphasizes a more up-tempo style of

Employment law causes riots in France 



There have been riots in France over a new

two-year trial period.

The Prime Minister of France, Dominique de 

Villepin. planned most of rhe legislation. 

The purpose of the law. according to the 
government, is to get young people off the 
streets and in a job by lessening the risks lor the 
employers. 

This created the controversey of the polity. 
Rioters fear this will ruin the already grim job 
market for the younger age group. Critic^ say it 
would damage workers' rii;liis and job security. 

In Paris, around 120.000 youths protested

At the march in Paris cars, buses, and shops 
were damaged. 167 people were arrested and

'I can't do that' epidemic hindering society 



Staff Column 



When I look hack al r 
shori-livt-d lift' of 24 years I a 
proud and I feel thai I ha 



Those simple words sound 
to me as II someone is taking 
their nails down a chalkboard. 

The simple Fact thai when 



people say "I can't 
do this. I can't do that," makes 
me wonder what they are 
keeping from us as a society. 

What arc they hindering 
our society from actually 
accomplishing by saying "I 
can't." whether that is in regards 
to a class, a paper, a particularly 
hard challenge ai work or wiihin 

The "I can't" can not only 
stand in the way of their 
dreams, but also in the way of 
possible betterment of society 
as a whole. 

I think the biggest problem 
I have is that I am a strong 



the "impossible" and saying 
"1 can't" is one of the most 
negative behaviors our society 
has created defeating this. 



Looking back through 
history there are many people 
thai if they would have said 
"I can't," we as a society 
would be lacking so much in 
our technology, sciences and 
the basic understanding of 
ourselves. 

Epidemic, according to 
dictionary.com. is "spreading 



infection and affecting many 
individuals in an area or a 
population at the same time." 

Typically this is used in 
the medical field in regards to 
outbreaks or disease. 

However, 1 feel thai the "I 
can't" epidemic has been 
created and can continue 10 
grow at rapid rates throughout 
our society, f ask myself daily 
if it is merely an individual's 
laziness or the lack of wanting to 
put an effort into accomplishing 
something. 

Now let me be frank in 
saying not everyone seems to 
have this because we still have 
a great deal of the "impossible" 
happening in our daily lives. 

To this 1 say thank you to 
all those who put so much 
effort into making their dreams 
come true and continue along 



'Those who choose to fail 
will, but those who choose to 
succeed will only grow stronger 
from failure." 

Thisissotrue in manyaspects 
of my own life. I have not only 
grown stronger from obstacles 
and the sense of failure, but 
I have also learned so much 
more not only about myself, 
but about life in general. 

Being a college student, 
I feel, is one of the most 
challenging things one can ever 
go through; at the same time 
it is also one of the best life 



of being here at 1PFW and I can 
see how much of a change has 
taken place within me due to 
my learning and experiencing 
here on campus. 

I would like to encourage 
everyone who reads this to help 
not only encourage yourself 
against the "I can't" epidemic 
but others you encounter as 

If you would happen to 
have a solution for the "I can't" 
epidemic, volunteer it and let 

in our dreams, abilities and 

Next time you're thinking 
about saying "I can't," look at 
the reason you're saying this 
and judge for yourself honestly 
as to whether you really can't.

Screaming from the Left 



By Andrew C. Hoover 



CNN. MSNBC and even 

This ' 'trivial" matter is a new 
bill that would add a single 
line Id your tax forms. That 
single line is the difference 
between private and public. 
The new line is a signature line 
of consent to allow the IRS to 
sell all your lax information to 
advertising agencies and data

And once a company buys 
something, they have the right 
to do whatever they want with it. 
They could, in theory, mail your 
tax information to everyone

Once your information is sold 
lo one person, they can trade 
it around, selling you and re- 
selling you to anything with

Nothing is more personal

stories about stupid 
people. Well, your wish has 
been granted, my friends. 

My mom has always told 
me, "The world is full of stupid 
people, just get used to it." 1 
would never understand the 
real validity of ilfis statement, 
..until.j' started, paying more 
attention to the news around 

Obviously, we all begin to see 
that people are idiots once we 
acquire our driver's license, but 
that is just because no one else 
knows how to drive properly. 
I know, we all think the same 
thing in the car, "No one else

Now that I have somewhat 
vented about the dimwitted 
people of our society, it is story

from New Hampshire. 

A 50-year-old cafeteria 
manager at a school in the town 
of Hampstead is being accused 
of stealing lunch money for the 
past two years. Seriously, she

about her breeding, moron. 

My third stofy of the week 
comes from that big state we 
cannot seem to get enough of. 
Full of the Cowboys, Astros,

teams, Texas is a huge part of 
the western United States. In 
the town of Killeen, a soldier

According to police, the 
couple told their three-year-old

As the professors' kinr noted, posi -abortion 
responses are positively or negatively .iffecied 
by demographic, psychosoi .i.il and religions tut ■

r. Someofthei 
for a number of reasons. 

First, despite the professors' promise to "make 
people aware of the scientific evidence" that 
refutes post-abortion syndrome, they did not 
offer any statistic, reference or citation to sup- 
port their statements. 

As a reader, I want to believe what writers 
f.Bu.t 



not generalize women's reactions after abortions 
addressed Do all post-abortive women struggle with psy- 
chological difficulties? No, and to say so would 
unfairly characterize women's post- abortive 



-and especially i 



experience- Hot in the light of: 
state that abortion is only harmless or benebcial 
10 women is an unfair generalization. Doctors 
would do a great disservice to suffering post 
abortive women by idling iheni, '"ion had prob- 
lems before," or even worse, 'lis all in your head 
— it's just made up!" This would further isolate 
the women anil invalidate any grief ihey might 
have about their abortions Additionally, doc 
i ignore the possibility of psychological

PAS. 




Second, the let 


er misleadingly 


slated 'the 


majoriry of women 


who have had abortions ... 


experience few long-lasting effects 


As the let- 


ter correctly noted 


post-abortion 


eactions in 



i show high rates of relief immediateh 
following the procedure. However, long-term 
studies have shown much higher rates of psy- 
chiatric disorder in women who have had abor- 
tions, including increased risk of depression. 
For example, a 20U3 study conducted by the 
Elliot Institute collected data from Ihe National 
Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY), a 21 year 
study that annually assessed 1,894 women. The 
date showed that women who have abortions 
are 65 percent more likely to experience clinical 
depression than those who carry iheir pregnan- 



diol nines women late after abortions do their 
preguani clients a disservice in educating them 
about all their options — another issue brought 



The professors' position on this point calls into 
question their stance on abortion education, as 
then letter ini|ilic- that calm .King women about 
possible post-abortion consequences is more 
dangerous than le.u ing her with nn knowledge of 
what she might experience days, months or even 
years after an abortion procedure.

Mifepris tone-Induced Abortion," found in ihe 
Dec. 2005 issue of the "New England Journal 



n find tl 



this letter from peer-reviewed journals accessed 
through the IITW library online One Search and 
the Internet.) 

Third, the psychologists' letter confusingly 
stated "no scientific evidence exists to support the 
\ alidiiy of (post -abortion) syndrome." despite the 
existence of the 2003 study and others that show 
higher rates of negative psychological effects 
on post-abortive women. The profe:

o scientific' 

support" PAS, but they spent much of their letter 
describing adverse reactions some women expe- 
rience after abortion. Such a ie&lt; litlic.il separation 
in terms leads to the following problematic claim 
in the letter. 

Fourth, the professors over-generalized the 
causes of psychological ditticuky some women 
experience after abortion. They alleged "for die 
most part, these women (who experience some 
psychological difficulties altei abortion! suffered 
from the same ivpcol dilfu ullics belore they had 
abortions." This position is refuted by research 
recendy published in ihe Ian. JOl'Jfi issue of the 
"lournal of Child Psychology and I'sychiairy." 
Researchers found in a J r &gt;ye.n longitudinal study 
that women "having an abortion had elevated 
rates of subsequent menial health problems 
including depression, anxiety,

Beyond this scientific evidence of serious 
physical risks to women having abortions — 
another fact denied by the professors in their 
letter — it seems that medical professionals are 
encouraged to inform women about possible 
physical hazards. Why, then, do five IPFW psy- 
chology professors believe women considering 
abortion should be denied information about 
possible psychological hazards? 

One of the purposes of being an educator is 
to provide a fair and balanced perspective to 
students so that those students can actively and 
knOWledgabl) engage ill ihe pursuit of truth. As 
such, it worries me when educators fail to sup- 
port fair and balanced education for women 
in crisis pregnancies, especially when evidence 
siippoiis ihe possjlulny ol terlain consequences 
like psychological difficulties When a woman 
must make a decision about an unplanned preg- 
nancy, the greatesi gift she can receive is to be 
informed of all of her options and an honest, 
sensitive appraisal ol die consequences ol those 
options. By being educated about the possibility 
of post abortion difficulties prior to an abortion, 
a woman can be empowered to understand and 
identify emotional pain she might feel and to 
ieek guidance and siippnn -.honld she need it.

Daylight savings time 
unnecessary and confusing 



Staff Column 



Ah, Daylight Savings lime. 
The one reason why I stuck 
around Fort Wayne so long was 
to avoid this whole concept of 
Daylight Savings Time. 

Yes, it provided a bit of 
confusion at times when my 
relatives from Ohio came to 
visit. We always had to double 
check to make sure that when 
we said meet in an hour, it was 
on Indiana time and not Ohio 

That sounds pretty stupid, 
huh? Well, sometimes they 
would forget to subtract an hour 
from the time on their watches, 
which is understandable. 

This whole concept of 
moving the clocks forward an 
hour in the spring is bogus. 1 
liked the fact that we didn't 
have to worry about it in Fort 
Wayne because it was everyone 
else's problem and not mine. 
The one thing that gets to me

Daylight Savings Time

months later when I really neei 



many people travel during day 
time and people do errands 
during the day time so il will

I must say that this is quite 
interesting. My only thought 
is that many people do these 
things anyway without the 
help of moving clocks forward 
and backward. The sun is still 
going to come up no matter

Bringing Dashboard Confessional a

Last week was one of my happiest n 

Amidst the growing tiredness ol ,i deadline night, 
great news; the IPSGA is brining in Dashboard 
Confessional lor i he spring concert. 

For those of you who don't know who Dashboard 
Confessional is, well, shame on you. If you do, then you 
are as excited as me to find out about this concert. While 
last year's Good Charlotte, Simple Plan and Reliant K 
concert was decent, it was a little too TRL-rific for me, 
personally. 

Dashboard, however, gives oft a whole different mood 
and is a very relaxing band. Their cool, sing along and 
melodic music is the best to come to Fort Wayne in some 
time. And, whether ii draws in a huge crowd or not, it is 
the right choice for ll'l-VV. It will compare somewhat to 
the OAR. concert of tuo years ago mood- wise and I have 
to say, the lack of screaming wannabe punk teenage girls 
will be enjoyable.

Mason again ties things up at

"I think [the loss is] a sign

run that helps. There's no room 
for complacency."

like we gave up. They picked up 
their game a lot more."
