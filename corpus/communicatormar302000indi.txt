commentary 



March 30, 2000 



What can be done to avoid inhaling second-hand smoke on the way to class? 




We have noticed that il can be 
dirD cull lo gel in lo Ken let Hall, ihc 
Classroom Medical Building, the 
Science Building and many oilier 
buildings on campus. The sidewalk* 
arc large and cleat of obstructions. 
The door; are easily opened and hand- 
icapped accessible. Therefore, there 
shouldn't be a problem. 

The difficulty of entering many 
of tile buildings on campus arises 
because smokers choose to use the 
en try ways as cigarette lounges. 
Several smokers cluster around vari- 
ous doorways getting their nicotine 
fix. Unhealthy as it may be, we under- 
stand a person has the right to cboosc 
to smoke. Some of us who have cho- 
sen to be non-smokers have several 
problems with the current smoking 
arrangement on campus. 

The policy on campus smoking 
is too brief. Page 62 of the 1999-2000 
Student Handbook and Planner states: 
"All campus buildings are smoke 

Thai is a no brainer Nearly 
every public building (with some 
exceptions! wc con think of. whether 
on campus, in the city or in Ihc state, 
is smoke free. The passage also states 
the purpose of the policy and ends by 



asking for the cooperation of smokers 
and non 'Smokers. 

We think several things arc lack- 
ing. First, cooperation between smok- 
ers and non-smokers needs lo be 
worked on. Second, an understanding 
of bow non-smokers feel about run- 
ning the gauntlet of smoke to get into 
a building needs to be established. 
l-rn.ilh .uit.iNe alternatives for smok- 
ed need to be pul in place. 

Il was brought lo our attention 
that, according 10 a ciiy ordinance. 11 
is illegal 10 smoke within 20 feet of an 
entrance of a smokc-frce budding. 
However, wc did some checking- and 
discovered that city ordinances are 
applicable to [he campus, which is a 
stale owned facility. 

According 10 Wall Branson, vice 
chancellor of financial affairs. Ihe uni- 
iL-rMiy has moved ashtrays away from 
the entrances. Branson said that peo- 
ple continued to smoke by the door- 
ways and simply threw Uieir cigarelte 
bulls on [he ground In order 10 avoid 
ihe mess created in front of the doors, 
the ashirays were put back in their 
original places. 

Some changes need lo be made. 
Il doesn'l look very comfortable for 
smokers lo stand and smoke. Why noi 



build an enclosure away from olhcr 
campus buildings where smokers can 
go inside, sit down and enjoy their 
cigarettes? 

A "smoking only" enclosure thai 
is properly vented could benefit 
everyone. It would eliminate the bull- 
filled ashtrays that currently adorn Ihe 
building cntrywtiys. It would protect 
non-smokers from being forced 10 
breathe second-band smoke and wear 
Ule seem of cigarette smoke on their 
clothes and hair just to get into a 
building. 

As mentioned, a separate smok- 
ing enclosure would allow smokers lo 
actually sit and enjoy their cigarelte. 

This enclosure away from cam- 
pus buildings would form real cooper- 
ation between smokers and non- 
smokers. Currently, smokers and non- 
smokers appear to merely tolerate 
each other. 

A separate enclosure would keep 
a beautiful campus from looking 
unsighdy al its doorways Our build- 
ings are the centerpieces of the uni- 
versity. Shouldn't the doorways 
reflect the sentiment? An alternative 
10 smoking in the doorways is over- 
due on Ibis campus. 



The human psyche? 



by Nathan Ericson, Staff Writer 

"Violence is spread worldwide and 
ihere's families on the streets... All we do is 
eliminate our future with things we do 
loday" 1 was reminded of this song by 
Blessed Union of Souls as i drove inlo work 

Last night I was watching a show 
called "O;." This is a show on HBO about a 
prison. I have thoughi ibis show was ptrity 
interesting and last nighi proved ihis 10 me. 
yet again. In this episode, the inmates riot. 
This in itself was very shocking and with 
this being a pay channel, there are more lib- 
erties with language and content. As the 
episode progressed, there would be flash- 
backs as 10 the reason why some inmoies 

One inmate's story was most appalling 
to me. This flashback consisted of ihe crim- 
inal chasing down an undercover cop and 
chopping his head off. The inmate surely 
was high on some type ol drug, which aided 
in his hysteria. This -was the-firsl of ■many- 
instanccs lasl eMOing.uiai scnimv innards 



The second event was in ihe same 
show. Al the point that the inmates started to 
riot, they brutally beat many of the guards 
and another inmate. There was no reason for 
any ol this, other than pare brutality. One 
inmate look a pen and stabbed another 
inmate... just for fun. Why? 

The next instance was when I was 
online looking for information Tor my post- 
modernism class One of the links provided 
for the class was 10 an artist. She had an 
exhibit named "Lustmord." This is a 
German word for sexual murder involving 
rape. My first inkling was why anyone 
would want to even title something like this, 
but the reasoning behind it was that the artist 
wanted to get inlo the human psyche. 

Okay I said and 1 read a bit about it 
The exhibit consists of three LED displays 
that give dialogue. One dialogue is of the 
victim, another of the assailant and the third 
of-an observer. All three LED displays ran 
simultaneously, just as if all three of the peo- 



borrifying. While reading these dialogues, 
there arc human bones sitting on adjacent 
tables to aid in the encounter. I was repulsed 
beyond words 

My first quibble with all of this is why 
we. as humans, have to see it 1 know that it 
is our choice if we look or not. but really, 
why even make things like Ihis? 

The second problem I have is do we 
need to explore the human psyche in this 
way? I think it is fascinating to explore why 
people love and why people do the things 
they do. These arc healthy aspects of the 
human psyche that we can discover. 

If we spend money and lime on finding 
the horrible, wretched things in ihe world, 
then society will only breed and feed upon 
that. How many senseless killings have 
there been in [he past years that came from 
someone listening to another person. and 
becoming inspired by them? We can blame 



music all wc want, but it is so much more 
than that. 

Il is the human being who is to blame. 
We have stopped taking responsibility for 
our actions Wc want justice, bul much like 
the inmates in "Oz," wc also want lo be let 
off the book. 

Wc want to blame all ihe other things 
that influence us, but the bottom line is thai 
we choose to do Ihc things we do. Wc may 
be opened up to another reality by the hap- 
penings of another person, but ultimately wc 
arc in control of ourselves. We need to main- 
tain that and wc need to take responsibility 



This is beneficial. Our future becomes 
brighter. If we go out and feed the evil with- 
in us, then what do wc expect to receive in 
return? The Bible says il pcrfecUy: "As iron 
sharpens iron, so does man sharpen anoth- 



Be responsible for a change 



A critical point was recently 
directed to my attention concerning my 
pievioii', artnie entitled "Get Off Your 
Duff and Re -use " The comment was 
made lhal it is not my responsibility as 
custodian to sort the re eye tables from 
ihe trash. 1 couldn't agree more. The 
IPFW custodians have more than 
enough to do without having to rum- 
mage through other people's refuse 

The ball's in the air. but nobody 
wants to call it. Hence, 1 find myself 
personally responsible lor doing it, not 
as custodian, hut as a human consumer 
and waste producer, physically able 10 
somewhat alleviate the suess pul on the 
environment by my existence. I feel it is 
not my duly, rather my privilege 10 be 
able to contribute even an act of caring 
for Ihe world which lends so much 
intrigue lo my life. 

1 dnn't expect anyone else to pick 
up the scraps I leave behind in my strug- 
gle lo survive. To me. It's an issue of 
being personally responsible Tor the 
translation of my thoughts inlo deeds. I 
am aware of myself and my precarious 
position among the cosmos. 

We ore dusi motes, people. One 
mishap on a planetary scale and poof... 
the universe continues, possibly not 
even aware thai those cuic. but rather 
|x .iilenr. little humans are gone. 

If Ihe Earth is still here, do you 
suppose it will miss us? Mow about'ihe 
sun? And the Milky Way? Yeah, right. 
We'll be missed like mucous blown 
from a galactic nasal passage. 

We should try 10 remember haw 
small wc really are and seek lo find 
meaningful ways 10 lead our lives with 
intelligent reflection on the grander 
scale In otder to do that, I think wc need 
to first take responsibility upon our indi- 
vidual persons for every action wc per- 
form and every thought left undone. If 
your homew-ork doesn't get done, il 
wasn't Ihc lack of affection shown by 
your mate. It was you who intentionally 



suspended your better judgment and 

acted on your "ill-concei "' 

And so on,.,. Whatever th 

always seems much easier 1 

then repeal if you let the blame lie away 

bom yourself. 

If we bold ourselves accountab 
for our own mistakes, wc will be le 
liktly in kel (.'iiili-riilden by others ai 
have a slighdy more realistic .num. 
towards changing our ways. Wc have 
judge ourselves, and ourselves only, for 
who else can see Ihrough the many 
walls and false fronts wc put up all 
around us lo protect our fragile egos? 
Only we can know our own minds 

pend our own reason and allow others 10 
do our thinking for us (more about lhal 
in [be future.) 

I suppose I've been on mj 
box for long enough now. Some 
probably resent me (or assumii 
need lo be preached to. For som 
resentment is probably justifiable Who 
do I Ihink 1 am. anyway? I lell you, "" 
just a guy who can't close his- eyes I 
Ihe misery in ihe world thai we 
easily avoid with just a little r 
rational thoughi. I can't forget it, 
some. Instead, I find the emotii 
weight keeps piling on and I think 1 like 

If you also feel the world's hurt 
and accept il as your responsibility to do 
everything possible 10 change il. lhank 
you. If you think I'm wrong, then it's 
probably your faull fjusl kidding). I'm 
not trying to lell you what to do. 

I Just hope 10 inspire us all to ask 
more questions about who wc really are 
and what we're doing here. I'll keep try- 
ing lo explain myself beuer in the future 
and please look deep within yourselves 
for your own explanations. Dare 10 Ihink 
for yourself.

Smoking in doorways impolite 



It is something many of us 
at least once every day here: A group of people 
smoking next to the building enhances on cam- 
pus. This topic has been brought up in mis paper 
before, bul I believe it warrants another look, if 
only because it happens so often. 

I don't bebeve I am alone in thinking thai 
wc should not have lo hold our breath just to get 
inside a building without coughing. Certainly 
there is a place for smokers on campus, but must 
they crowd around doorways 1 Some mig hi argue 
that they stand there because that is where the 
ashtrays are, but il's quite common to sec ciga- 
relte butts scallered around die ground. While I 
am sure ihe smokers doing this are small in num- 
ber, it reflects badly on all of ihem. 

There is another reason behind my writing 
to bring up this old topic. Recently 1 discovered 
that according to city law. it is actually illegal to 
smoke within 20 feci of an entrance lo any build- 



ing in which smoking is prohibited. Violation of 
that law is punishable by a fine of up to S100 for 
the first offense. $200 Tor the second and $500 
for each after that. (A copy of ihcse sections of 
Ihc City Code are available at hitp://www.rity of 
fort wayne.org/clcrkj_oificc/code/cbap94.bim). 

A good solution might be to place addition- 
al ashtrays further out of the building, or move 
the existing ashtrays. Also, more "no smoking" 
signs and signs that stale thai there is no smok- 
ing within 20 feel of the entrances, like those at 
ihe Courthouse and City-County Building, could 
be posted. 

The laws are in place 10 protect our health, 
but it should be common courtesy 10 keep from 
forcing second band smoke upon evcryom 
ing 10 simply walk inlo a building. 



Reporter is way out of line 



tication and distribution of The 
Communicator. With every 
publication of the paper, wc 
have celebrations, emotions, 
commotions. The publicadon 
could inspire Ihc drinking of 
beer and demonstrations in 
some corners of the campus. 

1 have seen ihe "Got 
Milk" advertising campaign 
and it is very tasteful. Pun 
intended. Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving (MADD) did 
get upset and I saw them lake 
their argument to ibe Today 
Show. I thought the spokesper- 
son from PETA was very ortic- 
utaie and tried 10 explain the 
organization's point of view. 
The spokesperson for MADD 
was very good also. 1 am not 
sure if Ms. Wood saw this pro- 



gram, but maybe sbe should 
have watched a lape of it 
before trying lo make her bad 

This article definitely 
proves the old saying "don't 
believe everything you real!" 
Are Ibe claims that PETA 
mokes about osteoporosis true? 
Are most of the other claims 
true? The loyal readers of this 
paper may never know. At 
least, noi in Mlshanna's article. 
1 am so sorry Mishanna's rela- 
tive is an alcoholic, bul t have a 
relative who suffers from lac- 
tose intolerance and sbe says it 
is very painful. 1 hope every- 
thing comes out alright for her. 
It has to be a crappy situation. 

Mishan nq W ood is way 
over the line. PETA, People for 
Ibe Ethical Treatment of 



lion, but Mishanna has men- 
tioned drinking a lot of beer 
and some milk a couple of 
times in bcr article. She points 
out in her article. "This infor- 
mation may be true, but 1 don't 
think II is fairly presented." 
The same could be said for her 

It is good 10 have some 
reporters out there reporting 
news wc all care about, but 1 
am alraid Mishanna is giving a 
slightly biased view in Ihis 
case. News people harm other 
news people by wiling bad 
articles and hopefully they will 
be taken care of by the food 
chain. I don'tcxpeci Ihis article 



xthelij 
is anyway.

Relieving stress 

by Brandy Jackson, Staff Writer 



This editorial is more of a shoot out 
than an editorial This article is meant for all 
of the people who are struggling through the 
"college experience" For example. I found 
myselfoncc again at ihe Shell gas slation last 
week paying with change for gas. As I drove 
away from there with a degree of frustration, 
1 began thinking. I wondered if college was 
really going to be worth the years it was cost- 
ing me. 1 do not know about you, but it seems 
tike I am always hurting for cash flow. When 
1 do get paid, the check is gone almost before 
I gel it. It is almost a no-win situation. I 
spend so much time working, I start lo won- 
der what I am going 10 school for. 

With all ihis stress of finance and basic 
survival, how do you cope 1 Do you live off 
the kindness of your friends? Do you call 
Mom and Dad at every turn? Maybe some of 
us gain hours at work. It is a fact, people, the 
"green" rules, the world and wc arc entering 
ai a level below eiisun.] tii'tii nun 

Everywhere ^6iV~ look and anywhere 
you go. it is the some and fun can only be 
achieved ihrough the mighty dollar, actually 
a lot of the mighty dollars. To go out and 
have a decent dinner with a friend is around 
$20 and if you arc drinking, the price could 
be. anywhere from $20 to S80 easy. If you 
want lo sec a movie and have snacks, plan on 
another $25 to $30. Do noi get me started on 
wbat it costs 10 enjoy a night of loud music, 
spirits and friends. 

How do we do il? Most of us in college 
have credit cards. There is no bigger mistake 
than to give a beginner in ihc world a card 
granting gifts and adventures with a great big 
interest rate. How many of you are in debt. 1 
Wondering where you are going to live next 
year? How is your credit' Like 1 said earlier, 
you can't win. Sure, this may be a part of life. 
It may happen to everyone. Wbai is to come? 
Let's face il. With spring finally here, 
we wont lo get out more and we want to do 
lhal at a minimal cost Arc there discounts 
out there for the college students of Fort 
Wayne? If so, where are they? If noi, would 
it not be nice? 1, for one. would go see a 
movie if il did not cosi on arm and a leg. I 
would attend more concerts and cultural 
events ai school if they interested me. I could 
make IPFW a fun place lo spend leisure lime 
and not view school as being so stressful. I 
would, if there were activities offered such as 
intramural softball or a concert. 

Until then, if you want a key on the 
nigbt life, check out the weekly publications 
of WhaE Up and The Communicator lo find 
out what's going on in the world. My advice 
10 anyone going Ihrough college broke is 10 
think positively, have fun and work hard. We 
may be under pressure and time constraints, 
bul there is always lime to relax and have 
fun. I know first hand the loll debt, rent, util- 
ities, car payments, insurance, long distance, 
nourishment, gas, credit cards and every 
other little bill can crcalc. It can be incredibly 
overwhelming, bul find comfort in knowing 
that you arc not alone. 

Finally, with summer right around ihe 
comer, employers are getting ready 10 hire in 
the summer help. For college students, this is 
a great opportunity to cam a great hourly rate 
and take some of Ihc financial burden off. 
Look for Ihc classifieds in the Journal 
Gazelle or online al www.fi waynejobs com.

Cultural Spotlight 



Life in Cyprus is unforgettable for one student 



by Kerrin Langford, 
Staff Writer 






id country in the 
' of I" 



Noi . 

Mediterranean Sea. is where Gcorjc 
HaJjlm ldUd comes from He has 
been al 1PFV7 for wo years now and 
will be graduating from the denial 
technology program In a year. 
Looking forward to possibly open- 
ing up a dental lab with bil win 
brother, ftadjunichael still cannot 
forget the kind of lifestyle he once 
knew in the south porticn of Cyprus 



we gel around one million tourists 
each year.' said ll;iil|irriiili.ul 
Unlike Fort Wayne. Cyprus consisLs 
of hilltop castles, bcacbes and 
rugged mountains, with a year-long 
sunny climate, 

Although many of the people 
in Cyprus live in whal is geographi- 
cally considered pan of Asiajnost 
have a relatively high standard of 
living like southern Europeans. 

"What I miss most about 



Greece is the nightlife." said 
Ihdjimicbacl. In a country where 
partying is a natural pan of each and 
every day, Hadjimichael and his 
new wife from Athens. Greece, have 
had to adjust. 'My favonle music is 
Greek music, which is dance music. 
We begin our partying around mid- 
mghl every night and slay out until 
four or five in the morning," said 
Hadjimichael. 

Like many countries such as 
Venezuela. Cyprus docs nol have an 
age limit an alcohol 'No one is 
ju&gt; in) attention lo age limit on alco- 
hol, because (here are no problems 

Hadjimichael After a long night of 
partying, people still work the next 
day. "We parry until early in the 
morning and yet «c mirl; tight 
hour days.' said Hadjimichael. 

This may seem hard Tor 
Americans lo imagine, being coher- 
ent and alert the OKI day, but even 
more surprising may be lo know that 
in his country, lime Is equally val- 
ued. 'If you nave an appointment, 
you arc id be on time.' said 
Hadjimichael. 



Hadjimichael thinks there arc some 
differences. Since 1974, there have 
been disagreements over who 
should control In ■ country With the 
Turks invading and most of the 
Greeks now living in the South por- 
lion as a rcsull. Hadjimichael said. *1 
don't know if it j because of (he 
army or that many people in Cypius 
sludy abroad, but 1 do think family 
is closer here ihan in my country." 

For this reason. Hadjimichael 
has nol felt as distanced from his 
family, "My wife was really close 
lo her family, friends and the 
nightlife," said Hadjimichael. 
Hadjimichael does admit thai he 
misses his friends quite a bit. but for 
his wife, it has been a greater 

Hadjimichael docs visit bis 
country often, lie goes back lo 
Cyprus in die summers to leach 
scuba diving. As a rcsull of teach- 
ing a wide range of students, mostly 
tourists, he has acquired a bil of 
German. 'I speak Cynriot. Greek, 
English and a bil of German," said 
Hadjimichael. "I have more than 
100 German sludcnls plus others 
from different Scandinavian coun- 



tries." said Hadjimichael. Possibly 
due to the huge influx of tourists, the 
cost of living in Cyprus is much 
more confined. "In my country, it is 
more expensive (ban here in Fort 
Wayne.* said Hadjimichael. 

In addition, education is 
viewed differently in Cyprus. 
Education in Cyprus is only required 
in children ages 6 lo 15. Although 
Cyprus has many technical schools, 
Hadjimichael chose to attend col- 
lege here for his interest in dental 
technology. Receiving family sup- 
port in bis desire to attend college, 
Hadjimichael said. "My father want- 
ed me to attend college." 

The importance of education 
influences women and men alike, as 
the society places equal value to 
both becoming better educated. For 

Hadjimichael. more than SO percent 
of the women of Cyprus work, even 
if they have kids. 

In comparison to his country, 
Hadjimichaei was quite shocked in 
terms of how strangers arc treated 
here. "People are much more socia- 
ble where t am from. Everybody is 
friendly. I guess because people are 



so used to seeing different cultures, 

Hadjimichael, 

Not only are strangers viewed 
in a differenl light, but discrimina- 
tion is perceived differently in 
Cyprus. According to HadjrmichaeL 
in his country. "We don't have dis- 
crimination." He perceives a sense 
of tension or discomfort between 
strangers here. "It seems as though 
(bey are uncomfortable looking al 
me," said Hadjimichael. 

Even though Hadjimichael has 
been unable to determine exactly 
anal discrimination means here, he 
suspects it exists. 'In my country, 
there are differences in lifestyle, but 
not in social soafa, so even strangers 
are trcalcd real well," said 
HadjimiL'bacL Perhaps, this is why 
Hadjimichael feels he has been 
treated as though he is outside, 
rather than inside the Fon Wayne 

All differences in culture 
aside, Hadjimichael has adjusted lo 
ihe Fort Wayne culture. He believes 
thai with the support of his new wife 
and his twin brother who is also 
here, be has managed quite well. 



To fulfill his need for social 
involvement, he teaches scuba div- 
ing during the summer. His (rue 
nature, detailed and artistic, turns 
toward the creative and technical art 
of mastering many intricate puzzle- 
like pieces for the teeih. These 
onlays, inlays, crowns and bridges

natural loolh. according to doctor 
specifics lions. 

In a profession that demands 
the perfection of ihe natural look in 
al temp is lo perfect a patient's smile. 
Hadjimichael has received first hand 
experience nol only in the lab, but in 

Naturally fitting, he has 
attempted to make the unnatural 
feeling of being in a new country 
inio a natural one. 

In contrast, Hadjimichael can- 
not forget what it feels like lo be 
away from home. Thus, be said 
wben he first got here. "It was real 
bard being looked at like I stood 

Perhaps the experience of 

being in a new country, he under- 
stands the importance of home and

ous who the real winner and loser 
ended up being when the night j:i^

undoubtedly the best film of the 
year, swept most of ihe major 
awards; however. Ihe Oscar show 



_ ways 

possible: Ihe dreaded half-hour pre- 
show beginning at 8 pjn. seemed lo 
last longer then the actual show 
(ubich ran over the hefty four-houi 
mark, even though il was listed as 
being three-bui that always happens 
lo some extent). Having to watch 
three or four young annoying idiots 
fawn all over the stars and giggle 
and chirp like lir.de middle-school- 
ers was enough to make one instan- 
taneously vomii. These people were 



so wretched, thai if it were any other

annual Academy Awards, but by

like I could .sit through anything.

acceptance speeches and some 
memorable moments, but by and

Instead of amazing dance 
sequences (which the academy cut, 
thankfully, to save time) and stirring 
vocals, we got Robin Williams' 
goofy rendition of "Blame Canada" 
from the movie "South Park; Bigger, 
Longer, and Uncut." And. as if there 
isn't a loi more evidence to cilc, 
Bdly Crystal, as host, was a shell of 
his former Oscar self, cracking lim- 
ited funny jokes and acting like he 
was disinterested and just wanted 
his paycheck. 

Despite ihe show not living 



up to being an Oscar-worthy great 
event (even with the new barter- 
edged sel designs, supposedly 
quicker-paced camera wotk and 
MTV style trappings which were at 
least different, but gave the show 
more of a minor-league feel), there 
was the fulfilling climax to the show
