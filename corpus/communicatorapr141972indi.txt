Steve A'incbrcnncr hurled seven innings 
of one-hit shutout ball to lead Indiana- 
Purdue to a 7-1 victory in the '72 opener 
Tuesday at Tusker Field. Binebrcnncr, 
who posted u G-l record last year, had a 
no-hitter going for 6 1 .3 frames, when a 
teammate, whose name will be withheld, 
badly misjudged a fly hall and lei it 
drop for a "hit". The ace hurler was 
taken out after seven innings, to the 
astonishment of many of the throng of ten 
or eleven spectators on hand, but the 
reason was obviously to protect bis arm 
this early in the season. 

The contest was closer than the final 
tally indicates. Bhen Wincbrcnncr was 
lifted, the score was just 2-0 in his fa- 
vor. Single runs in the first and second 
accuunlad for thnt thin margin. In the 
first, Dnvc llahn singled, stole second, 
and then came around to score the first 
run on a single by Frank Franks. Two 
walks, a wild pilch, and a ground out in 
Ihe second produced the second run. 



The game remained uloso until the 
buit.tni nf the seventh when the futlkcra 
erupted for ihrec runs und assured win 
number one for R'inebrenner. \ two -ran 
single to center by Jim ftil/cuiiiun UCCaunl 
ed for the First two markers, and ivns 
followed by another blast to center by 
Danny Grim, which drove in the third 

fielding fluw earlier in the game. 

Other important contributors to the of- 
fense were Mark Leinhos and Dave Cook, 
wliD bad two hits each. 

The Tuskers will journey lt&gt; \ngola to- 
morrow to piny a doublchcader with these 
same Tri State Trojans.

mine said that the reason he didn't be- 
lieve in find wan because his father Hied 
when my friend needed him most. "So 
jutl Cud would do thill." 

A short lime ago another friend said: 

"Mj f [) hits nil [he bod luck. How do 

you know why I don't believe in God'" 

"There was &lt;■ man in the land of \h. 



* Job; 



ind that 



perfect nnd upright, and one that fenced 
Cod. and eschewed evil." Job was "the 
greatest of nil the men of the com." 

Job was n righteous man. Yel Cnd took 
away everything he had— all his riches, 
and even his children. Upon being in- 
formed that he had lost cverylhiog, Job's 
reaction was described thusly: ' ' Job 
arose, nnd rent hia mantle, and shaved 
his head, and fell down upon the ground. 

1 out of my mother's womb, nnd naked 
shall I return thither: the Lord guve, 
and the I ..i.l hath taken nway; blessed 
be the name of the Lord.'" 

"Bleaaod he the name of the Lord." 
Job lost everything, except his faith. But 
the trials nf Job went even further, lie 
was given i skin disease, and, lo top it 
.ill off, lii- wife turned on him and mocked 
his faith in Cod. Vet Job kept his faith. 

Too man) people have their religion 
or principles of raorolil) grounded on 
sand. Individual's guidelines tend to be 
bused on things like habit, peer pressure. 

Some who pro teas Christianity merely 
maintain certain beliefs out of habit. 
Habitual types are susceptible lo drama- 
Ik desertion of their shaky morality as a 
result pT personal erjies. \ family death

en, if not destroy, her opposition to forni- 

Evpediency is another consideration, 

frequently the basis, of personal morality. 

Flexibility is the vital ingredient. Don't 



let your beliefs 
being somebody. 

Such buses of morality lead to the des- 
pair and doubting expressed by my fri- 
ends. Cod shouldn't be expected to and 
doesn't fit into our plans; we fit into 
Ilia. 

Job is hut one example of a sound faith 
In Cod. Job's religion wasn't a ritual; 
he had communion with God. Job didn't 
let his "friends" or carping wife shake 
his faith. Job didn't alter his beliefs 
a round expediency; he was somebody who 
lost all yet praised the Lord. 

God transcends mere earthly influences. 
Our morality should be based on .His will, 
as il is expressed to us through prayer, 
Ihrough Ihe inspired Word of God, and by 
the daily guidance of the Holy Spirit. 

St. Augustine wrote that Christians are 
strangers who sojourn for a lime on earth. 
The road is not easy. Temptations cat 
away at every soul brother nud sister. 
■'Give a little here" and "give a little 
there" is the order of the day. But I 
pray that my friends will heed the example 
of Job and siand fast in the faith. It's 
going to be hot as Hell if they don't.
