BROCK BASIC 



A covey of staunch 
Republicans braved a live 
dollar donotion and flocked 
to the Sheraton lost Sotur- 
doy for the Annual Lincoln 
Day Dinner. Highlighting 
the event wos guest speoker 
William Brock, Republicon 
senotor from Tennessee, 
who spoke about the virtues 
of revenue-sharing. 

Orvaa Beers Introduced 
the senator, telling the 
guests of Brock's back- 
ground. He broke Into nat- 
ional politics in 1962 by be- 
coming Representative In o 
Tennessee district that hod 

erotic years. After serving 
eight yeors in this post, he 
wos chosen by President 
Nixon to be the Republicon 
senate candidate In 1970. 
He defeated the incombent 
Albert Gove (Democrot) by 
seven per cent of the vote, 
Senotor Brack's experience 
has been with the Banking 
and Urbon Affairs Commit- 
tees. 

The senator brought out 
revenue sharing by sloting 
that is was one of President 
Nixon's propositions (in his 
State of, the Union Address) 
thot went rother unnoticed. 
The important point of the 
$116 Indiana will receive 



through this program isn't 
jhe dollars involved. "What 
is important to me," he 
said, "is that all of those 
dollars will be spent not by 
somebody In Washington, 
but by somebody in Ind- 
iono." The people will loc- 
ally hove a soy in the use 
of their money. To Brock, 
this is basic Republiconlsm. 
Today's system of giv- 
ing money to the state Is 
the categorical grant, admin- 
istered by Washington and 
loaded with red tape. As 



differ 



the communities priority 
needs. Washington doesn't 
recogniie this difference 
with the categorical grant. 

Although Republican 
philosophy deals with in- 
dividualism. Brock says

Hist 101 Activities Fees General Course I 






discussion of the 
attack by nearly 



as held on 
sembly fly- 
icluded the 



One hardly ttno'Vfs whei 
Jtodent activity foe. It has be 
everyone at some point and yet, 
student fee cards each semester. To understand the present 
situation, one probably should begin from the time the nomi- 
al fee ($3.'50] was raised to $30.00 a year. 

In the school year 1967-68 a referendum 
whether to raise the activities fee. A student i 
er supporting an increase to $15 a semester 
following items to be gained by a raise: 1] free newspaper 
mailed to your home every week 2) inhance- local and slate 
recognition of this campus by increased athletic endeovors 
3) free access to closed circuit Indiana &amp; Purdue sports 
telecasts 4} three 80 page issues of the Sixth Circle (cam- 
pus literary magozine) 5) national recording groups at dan- 
ces 6) a yearbook each year. 

While one could argue that exaggeration could only be 
expected, just these sample promises (there were many 
more) seem a bit much. But at least the students &lt;Jeserve a 
fair referendum. For several years past members of the then 
student government have deboted whether the ballot was 
stuffed by supporters of an increase. As it was, less than 
20R of the students roised everyone's fee almost 45% a 
semester. This20^ voting was split, ossuming the count- 
ing of only legitimate ballots, meorly right down the middle. 
Those supporting on increase won by only o few votes. 

Futhermore, the method of arriving at the $15 a sem- 
ester fee was sheer chicanery. If o voter wanted the fee 
roised, he could put down the figure he desired. These fig- 
averaged to orrive at o recommended fee, 



Bfi«

sster wi 



First of all, this not only lin 

the students butto only those who voted to re 

lOS of the students. Anyone who voted "no" 

forfeited any influence on later fee determin 

tem of overoging the totol leaves many't 

ponky. Students desiring an increase to $15 c 

filling out ballots suggesting $30 and 40 o semester (they 

did keep things respectable like a good political machine 

This method was wideiopen to distortion. The topper 
was that the overage fee, in spite of attempts to hike it fur- 
ther, was only $12.50 o semester.Somewhere between Steve 
Pettyjohn's leHer to the odministration and the Board of 
Trustees on additional $5 a year was tacked on. 

So, the referendum resulted in an increose to $15 a 
semester. In one of the more Amazing coincidences in l-PU 
history, most of the Greek orgonriotions, the Student Union 
Board, the Activities Board, and the Student Assembly fly- 
ers all urged adoption of a $15 fee prior to the referendum- 
The whole referendum, which the administration and the 
Board of Trustees so 'piously. point to when questioned a- 
bout the activities fee, reeks of a fraud. 

The question then is, why hasn't it been changed? Last 



■ year I served as Student Body President. Since my first 
I days at l-PU I opposed the activities fee and favored cut- 
! ting it to a small fraction of its siie or moking it voluntory. 
! But it wasn't that eosy. The members of student governmenf 
: are the ones who benefit most from the some $80,000 col- 
r lected (though the $30,000 spent on othlelics is never 
seen by elected student representatives). Thousands are 
spent by student government itself. The power to allocate 
the some $50,000 is the major power of the Senate, which 
means Senators tend to like to mointain what power they do 
hove. Futhermore, student government i members olio tend 
to be active iM, other things. They go to dances, join the de- 
bate team, go to the film series, attend convocation, pro- 
grams, and go to PIT performances. Their $30 brings a 
nice joyride. But It is also a matter of political survival. 
The largest blocs of voters in student government elections 
benefit most from the activities fee. Most students in the 
University Singers, PIT, the school orchestra, debate teom, 
athletic teams, ond the Greek system will cut the throat of 
any candidate who is out to attack "their" fee. 

1 tried to bring the activities fee^up in the Student 
Senate lost year. The Senate voted to go into comm.ittee of 
the whole where no minutes could be token. There they 
proceeded to kill the issue. After all, what if a referendum 
was held and the students voted to ellminote the activities 
fee? 1 was prohibited from even conducting a referendum un- 
der the Executive Branch. The Senote said that If I went to 
the Board of "trustees,, they would oppose me there, claim I 
didn't represent the students (after oil, 1 couldn't hold o 
referendum to bock me up), try to impeach me, ond every 
other method of intimidotion they could use. 

So lost spring we ran o slate which contained enough 
votes to substontiolly lower the activities fee. Our oppo- 
nents, PSA, in their platform also promised to lower it. 1 
quote, "We pledge to lower the $15 activities fee now in 
effect." They won but it's r(ow been mony months and the 
fee Is still there. 

hlowever, to Scott Gillie's credit, not to many others, 
a referendum was held. E'very student was mailed a bollol. 
While the number voting was again very small, at least it 
wos honest. The choices were very limited but very en- 
lightonting. Out of some 500 plus voting, over 60S voted to 
lower the fee to S6 a semester and charge allistudents.r 
The startling thing is this. 1 wos told by a istudentfl°vern- 
ment member that there was a near one-to-one correlation 
of the following things: 1) Those* stuttents now paying $15 
(i.e. students taking 9 or more hours) voted to lower the fee. 
2) Those students not poying the fee now (i.e. students 
taking less than 9 hours) voted to keep the fee at Jl5, 
meoning they still wouldn't have to pay it. In short, about 
every student voted straight pocketbook.

a reform party, and Brock 
feels It should keep up the 
Irodition.

Brock spoke further an reve-

will be split 50/50 between 
the state and locol govern-

Actually, this money will 
probably help to expand the

Over a long term this -type

FEES.. .cam. from pg. 2 

philosophical opposition to compulsory octivity fees (i,e, 
students who attend the activities should pay, not all stu- 
dents) ond I feel the question is crystal clear. The student 
activities fee was implemented dishonestly, has been main- 
tained unjustly in the face of overwhelming student opposi- 
tion, ond is forcing oil students to pay for the joys of a lew. 
The student government, the administrotion, and the Boord 
of Trustees should get tcgether and terminate the activities 
fee beginning next semesti 



needed for jobs will not be 
held to just o classroom. 
The school will be every- 
ones, -providing on opportun- 
ity for the students to moke 
the school. 

A dance at the Union 
Holl, Jan. 16 wos held to 
raise funds for the school. 
This was important because 
it wos on exomple of the 
Folk School in operation- 
people were doing something 
because they wonted to, not 
because they had to do it. 
The people planning it and 
Ihe bonds-Atlantis, Zelda, 
ond Lucy Gray were giving 
their time on a volunteer 
basis. 

Terry Doron feels that 
good publicity is needed, 
next to money, )o present 
the group as intelligent and 
serious. A recent article in 
the News-Sentinel helped 
greatly to credit the school. 
The group has also Started 
newsletter informing 
people of the work going on 
in Change Now, In addition 
Change Now has sent let- 
ters to fifty colleges des- 
cribing the school and ask- 
ing whether o student from 
the Folk School will be giv- 
en equol consideration in 
admission to these colleges- 

A larger, more varied 
crowd comes to each meet- 
ing of Change Now. Some of 
the projects are a Folk Fes- 
tival planned for the spring, 
selling posters and buttons, 
having o film workshop, and 
a dromo group. Chonge Now 
is also working on such 
community-oriented pro[ecls 
OS the Drop-out Progrom and 
the Ecology Problem.
