Jawad Mohamined, an 
internadona] IPFW student from 
Kuwait is being mourned and 
honored today. Mohammed came 
to IPFW in the fall of '08 and was 
majoring in Electrical En^neering. 
He was named on the Dean's and 
Honor list every semester since his 
arrival. Though he was not widely 
known here at IPFW. the people 
that were lucky enough to know 
him thought of him as a wonderful 
person. 

"He was always a happy, humble 
Ipersonl... Smart, generous. 



optimistic and a nice friend," said 
Azin Saeidi. a close friend from IPFW. 

Sadly. Mohammed passed 
soon after winter break; the actual 
cause and time of death is yet to be 
determined. 

All are invited to join in honoring 
our fellow student with a memorial 
this evening beginning at 5:45-7 
in the Walb Student Union, rooms 
222-226. Friends are asking that 
everyone be there on time so there 
is no interruption. They also ask that 
everyone dress and act appropriately 
for this solemn occasion.

After some minor setbacks, the 
Writing Center at IPFW, located in 
Keitler Hall Room C19, is up and 
running For the spring semester. 
During the holiday break, TutorTVac, 
tlie computer scheduling system that 
the IPFW Writing Center uses, was 
updated causing some problems in 
students' abilities to set appointments. 
TYitorlVac is also used in other areas of 
IPFW's CASA, the Center for Academic 
Support and Advancement, such as the 
Spot Learning Center and the Math Test 
Center. Despite the delay, the Writing 
Center is already flourishing this 



semester after a very busy end to 2009, 
Being unable to enter appointments 
did not hinder students who came 
in to the Writing Center as "walk-in" 
appointments. 

Now that students are able to 
make appointments with TulorTYac. 
students will have to schedule their 
appointments at luast 24 hours 
in advance. When searching for 
appointment availability, TutorTrac 
allows the student to see one week's 
worth of open appointments. Students 
are encouraged to set appointments 
that allow them sufficient time to make 
revisions after their consultations 
before assignments are due.

Runway Rundown: D&amp;G Styles for Old Navy Prices 



By Hana Hawash 



Haute couture never really seemed to make any 
gid upset; even the most fhigal shoppers love a 
label. The prices for labels, however, seem to make 
most girls, and their males, pretty sad. Stores like 
Bebe, D&amp;G, and Oscar de la Renta are not exactly 
in a college student's price range. Even Gap can be 
too expensive. We live in Fort Wayne, Indiana where 
fashion is not at the lop of the majority's priority list. 
This might be the reason diat the priciest store at the 
mall is Banana Republic, but that is the point. We 
have all grown up here learning how to save our hard 
earned cash. After tuition, car payments, and rent, 
there is not a lot of room for shopping sprees. Finally, 
someone has noticed. 

"1 ihink it is safe (and hopefully not insulting) to 
admit that Fort Wayne is noi the fashion Mecca of 
the world. ..but amazing fashion and trends are still 
at your fingertips," said Kim Halzle. Editor-in-Chief 
of Runway Rundoivn (runwayrundovvn.com), a new 
siie lliat Halzle created along with Jamie Evans, the 
website's developer. "We launched tlie website in 
lune of 2009. Jamie is a web developer and graphic 
designer and I am a fashion addici. We took our 
interests and came out on the other end with Runway 
Rundoivn," she said. 



This site contains simple ways lo copy the runway 
looks that you might find on television or on the cover 
of Vogue for a cheaper price. Granted, the clothes are 
not exactly the same as what they are modeled after, 
but that is part of the beauty. Sometimes, clothing 
straight off the runway is ridiculous, let's be honest. 
Not everyone can - or wants to - pull off green trapeze 
pants and shirts made of zippers. 

"...we want lo appeal lo giris and women 
everywhere." said Halzle, 

After perusing the site, it will be clear to see that 
the fashion guru does her research ivith enthusiasm 
and Evans knows his stuff when it comes to web- 
editing. With ever&gt;' look comes a link that takes you 
direcdy to the store's page where it can be purchased. 

"I think it is a really good idea for Icollege] people, 
1 have never really seen a website like this; I have seen 
it on E! where they have the fashion part and they go 
through celebrities and make comparisons [in pricel 
but I never knew there was a website, so that is really 
cool." said Jennifer Snell, an IPFW student. 

If any guys reading this are feeling left out, do not 
fret. 

" We think diere are great seasonal looks that men 
wear doivn the runways and thanks lo great brands 
like Banana Republic and I. Crew, they are very easy 
to pull off on a reasonable budget," said Halzle. 

Though the site started as a blog and is still not 
making any money Halzle and Evans are hoping that 



the site will take off soon and they will be able to do 
this full time, providing paths lo adorable, affordable 
clothing for the masses. 

"Jamie and I still have our day jobs. But, we are 
thrilled for the day when we can work ftilltime on 
Runway Rundovm," said Halzle.

IPFW Anthropology Department Digs 
up Exciting Opportunities for Students 



By Holly Eggelston 

e99tivno101tud1n1j.iptw.Kiu 



Many siudenis entering the 
work force or applying for grad 
school are smacked in the face 
with that familiar old caich-22. 
Good jobs and acceptance inio 
the best graduate programs 
require experience, a necessity 
that is sometimes hard to 
come by as an undergraduate 
student. 

Dr. Richard Sutter, of the 
Anihropologi' Deparimeni, 
and his colleagues are 
working hard to offer as many 
opportunities as possible 
to their students. Seniors 
Adrienne Taylor and Nicole 
Staley know first hand the 
benefits of participating 
in oui-of-ihe-classroom 

opportunities. In the spring of 
2009 they were 2 of 4 students 
given the chance to analyze 
human skeletal remains from 
the Mount Auburn United 
Cemeter&gt;' and present their 
findings at the Midwest 
Archaeological Conference. 

Taylor remarks that "A 
lot of other undergraduate 
programs in the country aren't 



allowing this kind of work from 
their undergraduates because 
they have graduate programs 
and that work is left to them" 
She goes on to explain "Our 
Anthropology Department 
is truly one of a kind. Every 
professor has something to 
offer a student if that student 
iswilling to takeit." 

That seems to be the 
altitude of many students 
within the department. 
Staley regarded the program 
with much enthusiasm and 
was also incredibly excited 
about the opportunities the 
experience presented. "This 
opportunitj' will give me an 
edge when applying to grad 
school. Not only will 1 have my 
research, but [ will have hands 
on experience." 

The department offers 
many experiences throughout 
the year to help give their 
students an edge. In 2009 two 
students participated in a trip 
to Belize with Professor Kip 
Andrews to excavate a Mayan 
site. Three other students 
were able to assist Professor 
Hal Odden in research on 
insomnia and present their 
findings at a conference in 



the students up for success, students being published". 



Connecticut. 

All of these experiences Staley feels that "This extra 

help to set our Anthropology time is what leads to students 

department apart from others wanting lo do research and 

across the nation. These projects that lead to presenting 

unique opportunities set at conferences and those 



The department is always 

iking for more experiences 

for their students and 201D 

promises to offer just as much 

excitement as 2009.

The second month of every year 
is a time to remember the trials and 
tribulations of the men and women of

bonanza aka (Saint) Valentine's Day. 

The !PFW student activities board 
has been hard at work to bring both 
some inspirational and romantic events

On the 10"' IPSGA will be celebrating 
Valentine's Day by hosting an event 
featuring the timetessly romantic and 
popular chocolate fountain with a 
selection of fruits and sweets", said 
Michael Smitli. Student Body Vice 
President of Programming. But the

750 complimentari' teddy bears given 
away to the luck&gt;' students who get 
there early. The bears come complete 
with a to scale IPSGA T-Shirt and 
a custom message by the 
students' to their valentine, 
mother or professor whom 
they need to suck up to, in 
order to get a passing grade. 
Professional artists from the 
TJ\.G Art Company will be 
on campus to tag the T-shin;, 
with the personal message. 
According to Michael Smith,

Carter- whom readers may recognize 
as the inspiration for the feature film 
"Coach Carter"- to IPEW on the 16th 
at 7:30 PM in the Rhineheart Music 
Center. This event will be open to the 
public and tickets will be available in 
the student government offices. The

vieiving of "Coach Carter" at 6 P.M. in 
the Walb Ballroom. 

To finish out the February festivities, 
a drunk driving simulator will be on the 
campus on the 17th. 

"We try to do as many season 
specific events as possible" said Smith. 
As for the drunk driving simulator, 
Smith wanted to have an event that 
educates students about the dangers of 
drunk driving.

How would you take it if the person 
you are involved with had other 
responsibilities that were just as/more 
important than you? 

By Hana and Devin 



Hana: 1 tliink tliat if someone likes someone else, they should find 
a way to show it. 

Devin: At the same time, you cannot expec^to be lop^rionV^ soon. 
How do they know you will stick around? 

Hana: Yeah, you can't expect to be a priority right away, but if a person is 
trying to win your affection, I highly suggest they show some feeling. 

As for sticking around, you never know thai. Even when you get married; 
people these days are all about getting ahead, getdng what they ivant. 
Sometimes, even in a marriage, people will leave. 

Devin: Thie, but there has to be something there to make them feel like 
its a possibility. 

Hana: Right. Like? 

De\1n: I can not answer that. Everyone has their own little signs about 
what is significant to them. If everything is in the early stages, and it's still a 
blur. I would not expect much. 

Hana: Well, unless you take the time to get to know the person, meaning 
take time out ofyour day. you won't know those signs. 

Devin: Only thing I can say is, be patient, they will know when they 
know. Until then, you either make the best of it or leave for something better 
because they can not e.xpect you to wait around forever.

From Page 2 



Appointments can be made for either one or two 30 minute increments. It is 
suggested that students with a draft go ahead and schedule 60 minutes and risk 
having too much time rather than scheduling only one 30 minute appointment 
and risk running out of time. When attending a consultation in the Wridng Center, 

students should remember to bring their assignment sheet and/or syllabus so 
that the consultant can better understand the task at hand.

Do Ask, Do Tell 



Commentary from 
the LGBT Community 



By Azariah Southworth 



We all have an opinion about Ihem. 
We all have our own perception of 
them. These opinions and perceptions 
are more than likely comprised by im- 
ages and stories from the media, reli- 
gious beliefs, stories you've heard from 
other people or personal experiences. 
lATio am I talking about? LGBT (lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, and transgender) people. 

Now. stop right there... what just 
popped in your head? What emotion, 
image, memory and/or person just 
came to mind? Is it good? Is it negative? 
Then answer why Why is it good or 
negadve? Not homosexuality specifi- 
cally, but these people. 

When 1 first came out to my parents. 
my Mom responded by saying, "You're 
not going to get really skinny and start 
wearing girl clothes, are you?" I thought 
this was a very odd yet funny question. 
Somehow this has become her very 
real perception of gay people. For some 
reason she has been led to believe this 
is what all gay people do. I responded 
to her question by letting her know I 
am no different than I was 10 minutes 
before I told her I am gay. Which is ver&gt;' 
true. Matter of fact, I have done the 
exact opposite of what she expected. 
Since I've come out, I have packed on 
a good five pounds and been buying 
plaid button ups tike they're going out 
of style (from H&amp;M nonetheless). 

There are a lot of myths out there 
about gay people. Sadly, they are con- 
trived by people and organizations 
such as the American Family Associa- 
tion (AFA), Liberty Counsel, Focus on 



the Family, National Organization for 
Marriage (NOMl, etc. 

Myth #1... 'All gay people are pedo- 
philes." Think of that gay person you 
know, if you do know one. Do you re- 
ally think they're a pedophile? Grant it, 
pedophilia cuts across ail lines of race, 
gender, and sexuality. So, yes, there are 
gay people who have sexually abused 
children. However, to say all LXiBT peo- 
ple are pedophiles is the same as me 
saying all heterosexuals are pedophiles 
because 97% of all documented pedo- 
philes are heterosexual men. It's unfair, 
inaccurate and a downright lie that all 
gay people are pedophiles. 

Myth #2... "Gay people recruit chil- 
dren." I must have missed this one in 
"Gay Summer camp" when I was 
child. Weren't you picked up by a 
middle aged man every summer 
and taught how to be gay? 1 joke. 
As a gay man, 1 was never "re- 
cruited" in any way as a child. 
My school didn't talk about it. 
my parents panicked at the 
thought of it, and the church 
I grew up in quickly con- 
demned it. Yet, 1 managed 
to still become the healthy 
and whole gay man I am to- 
day without any influence to 
be who I am from anything 
or anyone. So maybe I wasn't 
recruited and drafted instead? 
Damn those gay drafts! I didn't 
even have a choice! 

Myth tl3... "All gays are liber- 
als." When the only political party 
who vote for your equal rights are 
democrats you to would tend to take 
their side. However, you'd be surprised 
as to how many gay republicans there 



are. Matter of fact, there are two gay 
republican organizations. There are 
the "Log Cabin Republicans" which 
claims to have thousands of members. 
Then there is, "GOProud" who are cur- 
rent sponsors of the ultra-conservative 
CPAC annual conference. Of course 
the same "Christian" organizations 
which perpetuate these myths tried 
to get GOProud kicked off the list 
of sponsorships simply 
because it's a gay 
organizi 
tion. 



The only way an individual can tru- 
ly know what a gay person is like is by 
getting to know one. I promise you we 
are just as boring, opinionated, and im- 
perfect as you. I encourage you to get to 
know us, draw your conclusions about 
us from a loving relationship with the 
LGBT community. 

Dispel the myths and make a new 
friend.

Truman Show Sparked Reality Show Fad 



By Adam Wells 

wcllapOISiludcnt.lplwtdu 

in ihc year 2000, ihe reality telei-ision 
boom iliat wc are still currently engulfed 
in began ivith the creation of "Survivor." 
There had been a few reality programs 
before it such as "The Real World" and 
"Road Rules" but these were airing on the 
cable channel MTV. There weren't any of 
these kinds of reality shows on primetime 
network television. Then along came this 
show about a group of people living on an 
island and television hasn't been the same 
since. However, even two years before 
"Survivor" there was a movie that would 
in some ways prophesize the explosion 
of reality television. This movie was "The 
Truman Show." 

Jim Carrey stars as Truman Burbank, 
who unwittingly has been the star of a 
television show about his life since birth. 
Everything thatTYuman does is depicted on 
camera for the world to see. He was adopted 
by a corporation, run by a mysterious man 
named ChristoffEd Harris], who also built 
the world ihalTVuman lives in. 

That world is known as Seahaven, 



which is a massive soundsiage that runs 
as a Utopian society for Truman to flourish 
in. The "citizens" of this world arc actually 
actors that all serve a specific purpose to the 
city. They are carefully placed to advance 
storylines for the show. In this world the 
only thing that is true is Truman himself. 
His job, his wife, his house, everything 
around him has been set up for him by the 
peoplcbehind the scenes of this show. 

The film begins with "The Truman 
Show" having been on the air for thircy 
years. People all over the world tune in to 
watch Truman's life unfold on a daily basis 
without commercial interruption. This 
false reality is able to bring people hope, 
joy, or even a release from their own life 
so they might feel that somewhere out 
there they might find a life like Truman's. 
The ironic thing about this is TVuman is 
in fact not satisfied with his life. He is in a 
marriage that he feels obligated to be in, 
his job doesn't bring him joy or excitement, 
and life for Truman is dull and he needs 
more. He dreams of a life in Fiji, with his 
dream girl who used to be on the show but 
was fired for nearly ruining the falseness of 
the world that TVuman lives in.

TIM â¢ A â  I Y 



STONEWAll 



Artist: Tim Barry 
Album: 28lb &amp; Stonetmil 
Label: Phantom 
Release Date: January 26, 2010 
Sounds Like: A combination of 
Woody Guthrie, Johnny Cash, and 
all of the heart and soul that went 
with Ihem. 
Rating: 4.5/5 

Again another album to grace 
2010 with its presence, solidifying 
the notion that ' 10 could possibly be 
one of the best years in music that 
avid Lsteners have seen in a long 
time. 

The album is heavj' on country 
without being trite, opening with a 
track entitled "Thing of the Past." 
This album speak about "raisin' 
hell and livin' cheap" backed with 
swanky guitar interludes and 
country overtones without being 
cliche. Not only is the track itself 



good, but it is also a wonderful way 
10 introduce this album. It provides 
ihe listener with ample knowledge of 
the principles that Tmi Barry holds 
near and dear. 

28"' &amp; Stonewall progresses on 
with more solemn tones and even a 
history lesson in the track "Prosser's 
Gabriel. "This is something that Barry 
hasn't done before. With every song 
that can bring the listener dovm, 
Barry brings the tones back up ivith 
songs like"WillTraver' which sounds 
like something that should be playeil 
in a speakeasy. Immediately after 
this is easily one of the saddest songs 
to grace the ears, "Moving On Blue' 
creates an emotional wreck of the 
listener. Barry's ^Inerable voice 
paired with the piano and violin 
beautifully execute pain in this track. 
It is truly heart -wrenching. 

This album spans human 
emotion, exposing both the beauty 
and ugliness of the human condition 



2'MiaO^OBIN'S 
EWilVamEVIEWS 




Artist: The Magnetic l-ields 
Album: Realism 
I Label: Nonesuch 
i Release Date: January 26, 2010 
I Sounds Like: The soundtrack to 
an early Disney movie, but more 
abstract. 

Rating:3.5/5 

This album is whimsical in 
every sense of the word. With no 
prior knowledge of an artist or their 
library', one can be weary of the 
overall musical experience yet to 
be endured. This album was one 
lead into with no expectation, no 
connotation, and no stigrna. 

The album begins with 
captivating insirumeniaiion. fairly 
monotone vocals, and a majesty 
present that is a rarity among many 
independent musicians. The album 
is intensely fun and fails, in a good 
way, lo fit into any identifiable genre. 



ThL- best part of this is that they do 
not even appear to try lo fit into a 
genre. 

Some of the songs drift through 
the motions, at times moderately 
boring, but with the boredom follows 
some him of nuance that brings 
interesi right back into the song. The 
implements pass through feeling 
like being a part of a Renaissance 
fair, halfway expectant of costumed 
actors to come parading through the 
listening area, and some create the 
feeling of watching an early Disney 
movie. 

One track in particular entided 
"The Dolls' Tea Pany" somehow 
sounds like what a tea party should 
sound like â childish, fun, and 
proper at the same time. 

This is not one for everybody, but 
for an entrancing break from general 
genres this is one to give a chance.

In jeans, a tiannel shirt, and a backwards baseball 
cap with long hair hanging down, Nathan Garner is 
not at all what one would expect a Music Performance 
major ID looklike. No one would one expect him to be 
a fan of the works of Shakespeare. However, combine 
all of thai with an engaging personality and smile, 
and you've got Nathan Gamer. As various people 
describe him, he's a "farm boy turned theater guy." 

Gamer grew up on a family farm in Decatur. His 
whole family is involved in farming â they even have 
a feed mill, which Garner worked at from "about 
the time I could lift the bags.-Being a very family- 
oriented business. Garner was around his parents a 
lot. After a few years, he wanted to get a different job, 
so he ended up at Rural King. His experience with 
farming helps at his jobs because he was taught a lot 
about agriculture. 

"I never got into the 4-H stuff, though," Garner 
adds. 

He goes on to say thalhis mothertried to encourage 



his interest in music when he was in seventh oreighth 
grade, he didn't think it was "cool.." Garner's mother 
was involved the music program here at IPFW, so' 
Garner's interest in music came from her Garner 
explains that his mother took him to a show choir 
competition at Dekalb High School and he ended up 
having so much fun that they went back each year. 
This resulted in Garner auditioning for and earning 
a spot in show choir when he entered high school. 
He also began taking lessons with Michael Hayden. a 
former IPf^V professor. Once his junior year of high 
school hit, he began taking part in solo competitions 
at show choir competitions. His favorite memory 
took place when he was in one of the night concerts, 
meaning he was one of the final five contestants of 
the solo competitions. Garner was onstage in h-ont of 
800 people (with his mom accompanying him) and... 
"I nailed it," he says, as a smile spreads over his 
face. At that moment. Garner realized that he wanted 
to pursue music in college. He started as a music 
education major. After taking his hrst education 
classes and observing a few teachers, Garner decided 
he didn't want to teach.

IPFW Unites for Haiti 



By Nana Hawash 

hsruhaviaih^yahtto com 



With the death toll rate peaking 
above 15,000 in Pon-au-Prince alone, 
Haiti is hurting more than ever. It 
seems that America as a whole is pitch- 
ing in 10 help our fellow man ivith food, 
care packages, and first aid. Even with 
all of this assistance, money is siill 
needed lo help the country rebuild it- 
self. This is exactly what IPFW students 
and friends did last Thursday. 

Over 70 people showed up to drink 
coffee, cat cookies, and listen to music. 
"Rvo bands, Novafall and Within Rea- 
son, donated their talents for the cause 
and the even ing was definitely en- 
tertaining as everyone began to make 
friends in the spirit of kindness and 
giving. It was almost as if the destnic- 
tion in Haiti brought us together as a 
university to help others. One student. 
Cole Sperry, even said that he would 
match whatever the crowd donated, up 
to 500 dollars. His reason: "It looks like 
they could use a little help |in Haiii|. 

In the end, over 1,300 dollars was 
raised, which IPFW student and "Hai- 
tian Sensation'" Max Touloute says the 
country is in desperate need of. 

"(The moneyl is going to be helping 
widi construction and food. There are a 
lot of people who still have not received 
food....or help, "he said. 

People do not know a lot about Hai- 
ti, even though it is not very far from 
the U.S. People do not usually think 
about Haiti at all, but when they do, 
[hey think of a far away country. 

"A lot of people do not know iany- 



ihing about Haiti). I have had four or 
five people ask me what part of Africa 
Haiti is in; it is not even near Africa, it is 
in the Caribbean," said Touloute. 

Touloute says that it is a completely 
different woHd and that even though 
there is a government you would not 
know it. According to Touloute, the 
Haitian people want America to take 
charge and reform their government. 
Here, our government provides public 
services, in Haiti, they do not even have 
paved roads. Barely anyone has a car 
and whoever does is considered to be 
rich. When it comes to the poor people, 
every dollar counts; one American dol- 
lar is worth eight dollars in Haiti. 

"We basically need a government 
reformation. Our government is not 
good at all. Hopefully being in the lime- 
light of the people will come help us 
redo our government. All of the people 
of Haiti want that." said Touloute hope- 
fully. 

Some students think that America 
should stop running around helping 
the wodd when we have hungry and 
homeless people on ourown lands, but 
the majority say that we should stop 
being selfish for a little bit and help 
a country that is truly hurting. If you 
want to help out. you can buy a Haiti 
relief i-shirt from Tbuloule for just ten 
dollars; a paper heart from the Eques- 
trian Team (during the month of Feb- 
ruarj'); or simply donate your time or 
money. 

Contact Max Touloute (ioulmp01@&gt; 
students.ipfiv.edu) for t-shirts and do- 
nations or the Student Government 
office located on the second floor of Haiti Fundraiser: Mark McLendon of Novafall playing guitar at tlie Haiti 
Walb. Relief Fundraser, which took place on Thursday, January 28.

5 Reasons the Ipad Sucks 



^TRUMAN 

Fmm Page 6 



By Craig Lloyd 

tfiiig.lloyiiegmai] (om 

On January 27, Apple CEO Steve 
lobs announced the iPad, an inter- 
active tablet that resembles an iPod 
Touch but is quite larger. It has a 9.7- 
inch display and weighs a pound and 
a half. It nins a modified version of the 
iPhone OS, so the user interface isn't 
anything to write home about because 
il closely resembles your iPod Touch/ 
iPhone's interface with a few added ad- 
ditions and tweaks. 

While this was one of the most an- 
ticipated devices of 2009 (and 2010). 
Apple left out quite a few things on the 
iPad that are huge deal-breakers for 
myself and many other gadget enthu- 
siasts out there. Sieve Jobs pretty much 
said it himself that the iPad is a net- 
book killer, but in actuality, it's nothing 
close to that. 

No Multitasking 

The iPad runs iPhone OS, which 
means no running multiple programs. 
You won't be able to listen to Pandora 
whiletalkingwith a friend on AIM. This 
is one of the biggest mistakes Apple 
made. If this is supposed to "compete" 
with netbooks, it's has to be able to 
multitask. 

No Camera 

The iPad has decided to go camera- 
less. No iChat, no Skype. no takingpho- 
tos and no posting tbem to Facebook. 



No Flash 

As a device that focuses on enhanc- 
ing the web browsing experience, it 
doesn't support Flash. Il seems that 
every other website you visit nowadays 
uses Rash in one way or another and 
not having Flash capabilities is unac- 
ceptable for a web browsing device. 

Lack of Versatile Ports 

Again, what century is this? Maybe 
this is Apple giving you an excuse to 
buy their overpriced adapters. But you 
would tiiink that an interactive tablet 
like the iPad would have at least one 
USB pon. It also doesn't have any kind 
of video out. So diose awesome HD vid- 
eos you bought from the ifunes Store 
will have to be enjoyed on that tiny 4:3 
display. Have fun. 

This is only the first generation of 
the iPad, so we should expect better 
out ofApple in the future. But for now, I 
see no reason for wanting one of these 
when I already have my quick and han- 
dy netbook that does a much more. 






Truman begins to un- 
ravel the secrets of his 
world and then he faces 
a question that every sin- 
gle person has had to ask 
themselves at one point 
or another in their life; 
Do 1 stay comfortable 
in the life 1 know or do 
I explore the unknown 
risking everything in the 
process? 

As TVuman. |im Carrey 
was able to shift his act- 
ing tone dramatically. 
Known for his slapstick, 
gross out humor he is 
able to make this worid 
his own. He gives a career 
best performance giving 
this character enough 
heart and brain to m;ikf 
the audience understand 
who he really is. 

The key perfor- 
mance in the film is by 
Ed Harris as Christof, 
He loves TVuman like 
a son but at the same 
time he wants to keep 
his product going on for- 
ever. In doing so, he has 
completely sheltered 
him from experiencing 
life. Truman has never 
known failure in this 
world. He has been given 
the "perfect" life but he 



isn't satisfied with it be- 
cause he never actually 
gels to make a choice. As 
Christof, Harris walks 
a fine line bet^veen be- 
ing sympathetic as the 
parental figure trying to 
protect his child from the 
eials of the "real" world 
and evil by trapping Tru- 
man in this world for his 
own game. 

"The TVuman 
Show" gave America its 
first real taste of the re- 



ality television genre. 
Il was a work of fiction 
iliai ended up being a 
lot more like the world 
today. Every network to- 
day is using reality pro- 
gramming in its prime- 
time lineup because they 
know people will tune 
in. There is something 
about the appeal of the 
"everyday" person on 
television thai is always 
going to get the masses 
to tunc in.

Women's basketball 
crushes rival Jaguars 



By Logan Pea 

|ieall01Osnjdcnts.ipfwcdu 

Something about the Men's and 
Women's basketball teams this past 
weekend motivated them to walk into 
lUPUl and show the big cit&gt;' that there 
was nothing small about Fort Wayne, 
Indiana. The Women's basketball team 
made a big statement Saturday after- 
noon as they dominated the Jaguars 
from the tip-off to the final horn to grab 
a 66-49 win. The women's team spread 
the scoring around on Saturday and 
still managed to get four teammates 
into double figures. 

Right out of the gates, IPFW hit the 
floor running. With over twelve min- 
utes remaining in the first half, the 
dons lead bad grown to an astounding 
26-4. Would they lei up? Of course not. 
At the break, thanks to a pair of free 
tosses by Sydney Weinert, IPFW went 
into the locker room with a dominai- 
ing37-18lead, 

lUPUl would fight back and evenm- 
ally cut the lead to 9, but the hard work 
of the Dons fought them offoncc again. 

lust the way she's done it all season, 
Anne Bosse knocked down a big three- 
pointer with twelve minutes rema 
and sparked a 7-3 run for IPFW. 

The laguars became desperate late 
and had nothing left to do but foul, but 
lucky for us, the Women's squad hit 
their tosses and sealed the win. IPFW 
went 18-23 from the Une and that's ex- 
actly what \v\\\ seal win for any basket- 
ball team.
