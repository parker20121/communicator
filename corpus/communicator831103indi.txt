Reagan's action 
too strong 



President RcaBfln's reactions to 
events in Lebanon and Grenada the last 
two weeks prove he insists on spilling 
more blood even though the state of 
world peace is shaky. 

In his speech last week. Reagan cited 
the situations in Lebanon and Grenada 
as examples of Soviet efforts to un- 
dermine democracy If he wants to be a 
policeman guarding world democracy, 
why can't he do so with diplomacy? Why 
does-he want the U.S. to flex Its muscles? 

Reagan showed some sympathy when 
he sent Marines to cvacualeU.S. citiiens 
from Grenada. He became a bully, 
however, when he' ordered Marines to 
invade the island After evacuating U.S. 
citizens, the Marines should have left. 
Heagan, however, claimed Grenada was 
a "Cuban-Soviet colony being readied as 
a major military bastion to export terror 
and undermine democracy." 

Over 200 Marines were killed in 
Lebanon, but Reagan claims the Soviets

Why send troops? If Reagan believes 
the Soviets encouraged violence in 
Lebanon and Grenada, why couldn't he 
have tried to arrange a time and place 
where he. Yuri Andropov and Fidel 
Castro could talk about it. Actions like 
this may take longer to produce sub- 
stantial results, but at least less people 
would have died.
