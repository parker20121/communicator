Girl Scouts gain liands-on experiences 
from Society of Women Engineers 




Area girl uzouls got a glimpse of the engineering 
profession on Saturday. Oct. 14. during a session wilh 
IPFW's Society of Women Engineers. 

The two-hour event, which began at 10 a.m. at the 
Engineering and Technology Building, acquainted girls 
between the ages of 10 and 14 with a few of the engi- 
neering fields available ai IPFW and introduced Ihem to 
the roles women play in those fields. 

"We bring girls and gel ihem eiposed lo the concept 
of what engineering is that women can be in engineering 
just as well as men can and that there arc diPferenl fields 
of engineering," said the president of the Society of 
Women Engineers. Kelly Konger. 

"We have a prcsentalion and show them a tape. 
First, we give them a disk and the disk gives Ihem an idea 
of what IPfW is and the areas of Ihe field of engineering 
ol IPFW. Then there is a tape on ihe Society of Women 
Engineers Ihat focuses on different fields and viomen in 
engineering." Konger added. 

Four stations dealing with Java programming, 
circuits, arehitectutc and wind tunnel and pumps were 
created. Women from the four fields undertook the task

whai Ihey want it to do," Lolhamer said. 

Charity Hein and Yenc Tebebu. electrical engi- 
neering students, showed Ihe girls how to build a 
simple cireuil by first introducing them to a few concepts 
such as volLige. current and resistance through the circuit 
and ihen giving them a hands-on practice eicrcise. 

"The reason why we have things like this is to intro- 
duce engineering to girls al a younger age. ID give Ihem 
an idea of how electrical engineering works and how we 
design things. We also provide fun activities, to get Ihem 
' 'ed and exposed to Ihe difTerent kinds of engineer-

Constance Killian. architectural engineering and 
technology student, talked to the students about architec- 
tural engineering and showed them how floor plans ore 
drawn. Faculty adviser for the Society of Women

well as the IPFW students benefited from Ihe mentoring 



of Ihe

Branson said this year the 
university has asked for 1.4 mil- 
lion dollars in equity funding, 
(money ihat would be used to add 
faculty, improve the library serv- 
ices and replace equipmenl). [f 
the university was granted this 
amount it would be even with Ihc 
aii'cragc amounts of other region- 
al lU and Purdue campuses.

IPFW allotted S4,054 per s,tu- 
dent; however, according to the 
Indiana Commission for Higher 
Education, the average appropri- 
ation is S5,I03. Johnson men- 
tioned that although IU Kokomo 
has less sludenls thai IPFW. it 
receives more funds. 

"Nearly eighty-two pereeni 
of IPFW graduates slay in the 
area. They are your nurses, edu- 
cators and buiiness leaders and 
much more. 1 urge you (the leg- 
islators) to make a difference," 
said Johnson.

more equipment ihat could be

tance learning ITS services IS so 
snatched that Ihe needs of die 
faculty and students aren't being 
met, she said. 

"When we try to compare 
our funding to that of other stale 
univeisities. funding for us is like 
comparing a golf cart to a

voters this election has seemed to 
focus not so much on the issues, but much more on the 

sense of how either Bush or Gore feels about certain top- 
ics, or if they are compassionate or sensitive. It's all over 

a few weeks ago and overheard a man saying, 'I would 
vote for Gore because he seems like a lunny and nice guy.' 
Whal??'? Then he went on to say. "I don't know anything 
aboul the issues, but he is just a caring guy.' Huh??? I have 
overheard oiher conveisaiions. "Bush is just woy lix&gt; gruff. 
He's just so straight-faced." Why do these things matter? 
Thai does not matter. Those oie not issues thai should be 
deciding factors in choosing Ihe leader of our country. 

This would be the optimal, no, Utopian, election cii- 
leria. We, the public, should never gel to see the candi- 
dates. We stereotype and judge when we see them. I'm not 
saying this is righi or wrong, but II happens. We, the pub- 
lic, should make our decision solely upon a candidate's 
platform, not based upon Ihe .show he gives while standing 
on a platform. We should see Ihe real issues such as lanes, 
welfare, social security and, for this election, prescription 
drugs and moke an MJucated decision based upon these 
Ihings. But since this is not a ulopia... 

Keep Ihis in mind when voting Ihis year. A person's 
showing of emotion or non-emotion is not an luue. Whal 
a candidate's plans for the future is. Please do not be one 
of those people who votes just because Ihe guy can make
