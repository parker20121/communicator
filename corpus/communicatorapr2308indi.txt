The darkest irony was 
beheld in the form of 
the yellow fliers declar- 
ing: "Dons Against Vio- 
lence," found everywhere 
around the student hous- 
ing, including the young 
woman's apanment. 

The day wore on. An 
email had gone out an 
hour after the body of 
the girl was found let* 
ting students know that 
a death had occurred in 
the student housing, ad- 
vising students to exer- 
cise caution. The police 
declared that they were 
conducting a death in- 
vestigation. TWo more 
emails were sent out; one 
at 2 p.m. and another at 
2:45. The first confirmed 
the death; the second re- 
ported that it appeared 
to have been a homicide. 
Shasta Meyers, room- 
mate to the victim, and 
the person who found 
the body, was escorted 
out by her family. 

All classes for the re- 
mainder of the day were 
cancelled. Students fil- 
tered out of building H 
in a long line of laundry 
baskets, suitcases and 
backpacks. The parking 



lot slowiy emptied of stu- 
dents' cars. 

The student body 
is now shock and awe. 
Some aie nervous, while 
others seem fascinated. 
But all are faced with the 
stark reality of two IPFW 
students suddenly and 
savagely slain within 12 
days of each other.' 

Students are worried, 
some are even moving 
out of their apartments 
in Waterfield Housing. 
The safety of not only 
the IPFW college cam- 
pus, but also the student 
housing campus has 
been questioned - ques- 
tions to which Chancel- 
lor Michael Wartell has 
responded. 

Lola Martinez was 
a girl who like televi- 
sion shows like "Grey's 
Anatomy" and "Family 
Guy" who enjoyed read- 
ing books like "Harry 
Potter" and "Running 
with Scissors." She liked 
motorcycles and party- 
ing. Although Lola didn't 
deserve the brutal death 
she was handed, we will 
all remember her the way 
she lived. 

Though there are 



questions to be raised 
regarding campus secu- 
rity, Chancellor Wartell 
addressed university 
members by remind- 
ing us that we are alt 
responsible for a secure 
campus. 

"At IPFW, our great- 
est strength and our 
shortest path to assur- 
ing our security is our 
belief in and reliance 
on community. Every 
one of us who is a mem- 
ber of the IPFW com- 
munity or who cares 
about someone that is 
a member of the IPFW 
community can and 
should help assure the 
safety and security of all 
on campus. We must be 
vigilant for signs of po- 
tential trouble or lapses 
in security. We must be 
prompt and persistent 
in bringing those mat- 
ters to the attention 
of individuals charged 
with addressing such 
issues (e.g., University 
Police, Physical Plant, 
Campus Housing, Dean 
of Students, or Student 
Affeirs)."

Invest in your sanity 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

ruckjlOieiphv.edu 



I know you'll all be 
disappointed [hat this 
week's column lias 
absolutely nothing to 
do with making/ saving/ 
gaining/ losing money. 
But finals are looming, 
and for many of IPFW's 
finest, so is graduation. 

This means graduates 
either have to suck 
it up and get a real 
job, or get ready for 
graduate school, shifting 
educational aspirations 
into overdrive. Sprinkle 
in a few final exams, term 
papers, and the recent 
campus happenings, and 
job hunting, and - BAM! 
- instant stress bomb 
seems to be ticking away 
inside each of us. ^ . ,. 

This week, take a few 
moments to list your 
priorities; educationally, 
financially, spiritually. 



Make a list of when 
things need to be 
finished, and do not 
forget to pencil in 
some time for yourself. 
If this sounds oddly 
reminiscent of the 
financial "snowball 

effect" you read about 
earlier in the semester, 
you would be correct. 

It's crunch time. 
Instead of hitting 
the panic button 
at the seemingly 
insurmountable tide 
of homework, papers, 
and social life, try this: 
plan out your week, day 
by day. 14our by hour if 
necessary. Yeah, yeah, it 
sounds stuffy and a Hide 
too lype A, but listing 
is a highly effective 
manner of prioritizing. 

You have a paper due 
TuesdayinonecIass,and 
Thursday in anoihtt?" 
All right. Budget your 
time effectively, and 
stick to your schedule. 



The next few weeks are 
not the time to lose focus. 
Tell your friends that you'll 
see them at a scheduled 
time, and leave when you 
said you would. If they 
complain that you're a 
flake, let them know it's all 
about getting through the 
final exam crunch. They 
should understand. 

If there is an 
educational meltdoivn in 
your immediate future, 
please stop and take the 
time to relax. Listen to 
your iPod, call up an old 
friend, or if you're at home 
light a few candles and 
read a few passages of a 
book. Final exams are 
merely the period to the 
semester sentence; don't 
take them too seriously if 
you'vebeenasolid student 
for the bulk of the year. 

If you've slacked off

The devil, ESP, and Social 

Generation X more likely to believe in paranormal 



By DOUGLAS SCHMIDT 

tchmdnOl Oiptw.edu 



A recent study 
conducted by Scottrade 
and Betterin vesting 

shows that the majority 
of Generation X doubts 
that they will ever be able 
to fully retire. 

According lo the 2008 
American Retirement 
Study, a poll of 1,000 
adults, only 31 percent 
of Americans aged 27 to 
42 believe that they will 
one day be able to stop 
working. 

While members 

of Gen X ate doubtful 
about retirement, many 
of them are confident 
about the existence of 
the paranormal. 

A 2005 Gallup poll 
showed that 45 percent 
of those aged 18 to 29 
believe in ghosts. By age 
3D. that figure drops to 
35 percent, but it is still 




more dian those who 
believe in retirement. 
That same year, another 
Gallop poll showed that 
42 percent of Americans 
believe that people are 
sometimes possessed 
by the devil. 41 percent 
believe in extrasensory 
perception or ESP and 
37 percent believe in 
haunted houses. 

Why does Generation 
X feel more certain about 
the supernatural than 
retirement? For many. 



doubts about Uncle 
Sam and simple lack 
of preparation are to 
blame. 

According to the 
Retirement Study, 40 
percent believe that they 
cannot depend upon 
Social Security benefits. 
Forty percent have less 
than 325,000 saved for 
retire menL TWenty-one 
percent either have not 
started saving or do not 
know how much they 
have saved. To deal with 



Security 

than retirement 

these problems, most 
membersofGenerationX 
say that they are spending 
less and working to pay 
off their debts. 

As reported earlier in 
the semester, the latest 
Social Security Trustees 
report stales that unless 
taxes are increased 
dramatically, students 
age 33 and under could 
lose one forth of the 
money they pay into 
the system. This does 
not count loss due to 
inflation. If birth or death 
rates are tower than 
the Thistees' estimate, 
the loss could be even 
greater. 

With a hfetime 

average income of 
S40.000, Social Security 
taxes takeS5,000pcr year. 
Investing that money 
privately, assuming an 
average of eight percent 
remm, could give Gen 
X over SI miUion more 
than Social Security. 



VCD Senior Exhibit 
Letter to the editor 



To whom it may 
concern. 

Upon reading the 
article published this 
week entided "IPFW's 
VCD Senior Exhibit at 
die Allen County Ihjblic 
Library" written hy 
Marisha Zimmerman. I 
noticed that there was 
absolutely no mention 
of a few of the exhibits. 
I count at least five 
exhibits that were 
omitted firom this article. 

It would have been 
nice to see all 14 of 
the graduating seniors 
featttred, or simply 
mentioned. We were 
looking fonvard to 
reading this article only 
to be dumbfounded as to 
why some of our fellow 
seniors were omitted. 

The Communicator 
dedicated an entire page 
to this article; I don't see 
why all 14 of the VCD 
graduating seniors could 
not be mentioned. 

-anonymous 



Dear Anonymous; 

You're right. We at 
The Communicator 

should have included 
every student's project 
in the article. The only 
problem is that without 
advanced notice, {i.e. 
student participation 
in the newspaper) it is 
extremely difficult to do 
so. 

Our writers try 
to cover as much as 
possible, when we have 
notice of things and 
we wholly support the 
student body, as well as 
their endeavors. Please 
understand that this is a 
student newspaper and it 
cannot function without 
student input. 

Thank you 

Anonymous for bringing 
this issue to light, and 
1 hope this response 
helps.

Eclectic Art 

College Night at the Museum of Art 



li nimnid0 1 6 iphv.ndu 



College Night at the 
Fon Wayne Museum 
of Art took place Friday 
night and was attended 
by students from Taylor 
University, St. Francis 
University, and IPFW. 
The an or students from 
IPFW. Manchester Col- 
lege, St, Francis Universi- 
ty, and Taylor University 
was displayed in the main 
entrance. Tjiere was mu- 
sic, free food, a cash bar. 
and a lot to talk about. 

The various pieces 
of art formed an eclec- 
tic, diverse gallery with 
a variety of perspectives. 
There were works made 
of paint, wood, charcoal, 
print, pencil, and photog- 
raphy 

One of these works 
was an abstract piece 
by )osh Hocring called, 
"Certaldo Alto." He paint- 
ed this picture after be- 
ing Inspired by his trip to 



Certaldo, Italy He pasted 
a shopping list and maps 
he found to the canvas 
and painted over them, 
dreiv leaves from pictures 
of the trees he took, and 
used a picture of a statue 
in the middle of the city. 
The painting is his mem- 
ories of Certaldo and it 
came through in a beauti- 
ful and expressive way. He 
had this to say about the 
evening: 'It's good to see 
this many people coming 
together in Fort Wayne 
in the name of art." losh 
participated in the even in 
order to support the com- 
munity of Fort Wayne art- 
ists. 

Another interesting 
piece included Nancy 
Ngo's "For the Greater 
Good." This haunting 
black and white image 
of a group of people who 
appear to be wailing was 
beautiful and intriguing. 

Apiece Ehatreally stood 
out was Chase Wire's 
"Retrospect." This printed 
piece was part of a series, 
as Chase eiqplained. and 
it was originally the reject 



of the series because the 
paper tore and it did not 
come out originally as he 
planned. Chase explained 
that his motivation for 
this piece was inusic. "I'm 
a musician, and I wanted 
the print to be as spon- 
taneous as when 1 create 
music. A more organic 
approach to the st\'le of 
printing I used." Cha:^e 
also said (hat the ni(;lu 
"was really well attentlL-il 



and the art isn't bad!" 
Overall, the night was a 
great evening for students 
to come together to so- 
cialize, discuss art, relax, 
and meet new people.

Witzlgreuter'°p '"'""' 



Fort Wayne 



By ANTHONY 
SWANSON 



When reviewing the Fort 
Wayne music scene, one 
person stands out from 
tliat of other musicians 
and artists, lordan Wit- 
zigreuter's unique last 
name is not the only thing 
that sets him apart in the 
loaded and ever growing 



music scene. 

Witzigreuler's talent 

showcase as a member 
of four of Fort Wayne's 
most popular bands has 
made him one of the most 
well-known artists in Fort 
Wayne, and has gained 
the attention of fans 
across the country. 
Whether he is behind 
his drum set or dancing 
around the stage with 
a microphone in hand. 



Witzigreuter knows how 

to showcase his skills. 
Since the age of 10, when 
he first started playing 
drums, Witzigreuter has 
kept his plate full. 
As a member of Take 
Sides, a now defunct ska 
band, a U-year-old Wit- 
zigreuter held down the 
drum beat and helped 
his band to a victory in 
2004 's inaugural Fort 
WajTie Battle of the Bands. 




Photo by EVAN PERIGO 



The victory thrust^Witzi- 
greuter into the spotlight 
of the Fort Wayne music 
scene and he stepped out 
since. 

After Take Sides parted 
ways, Witzigreuter, along 
with another member 
of Take Sides, Victor Al- 
varado, started brideand- 
groom in the summer of 
2006. Going away from 
the ska style and leaving 
behind his drum set, Wit- 
zigreuter shared the sing- 
ing duties with Alvarado, 
while playing some key- 
board to complement Al- 
varado's acoustic guitar 
The duo toured the Mid- 
west through 2006 and 
into 2007, providing Wit- 
zigreuter ivith some of his 
best memories of perfor- 
mances. "I had a bunch of 
sweet shows in brideand- 
groom that really stood 
out. Mosdy the small ones 
on tour," he said, reflect- 
ing on a tour that led him 
and Alvarado everywhere 
from Chicago to Texas, 
in venues ranging from 
parks to dance halls. 

The band built a large 
fan base that still thrives. 
despite Witzigreuter and 



Alvarado taking a break 
from brideandgroom last 
fall. Witzigreuter does 
not see anything hap- 
pening soon with brid- 
eandgroom, much to the 
disappointment of their 
fans. "Right now, bride- 
andgroom isn't really do- 
ing anything. Victor lives 
in Chicago and is going to 
culinary arts school and 
I'm super busy with The 
Ready Set and Saints Nev- 
er Surrender," he said. 

Witzigreuter is con- 
stantly working on new 
music for The Ready Set. 
"1 always try to keep things 
running through my head, 
like melodies and lyrics 
and everything," he said. 
"But by the lime 1 actually 
get to record them or write 
them down, I usually for- 
get them." The inspira- 
tion for his music ranges 
from friends and family to 
his girlfriend, Katelyn, 
The Ready Set's popu- 
larity has come through 
word of mouth and In- 
ternet promotion. "I 
talk to a lot of people on 
M^pace and all that, but 
i think the majority of 
(the popularity] has been 
word of mouth," said Wit- 
zigreuter, Openness and 
availability to fans is very 
important to Witzigreuter. 
"It always makes me mad 
when bands I like don't 
respond to comments or 



messages. If people take 
the time to listen to my 
music and say hi, I think 
it's important that I holla 
back," he said. 
Along ivith his work on 
The Ready Set. Witzi- 
greuter joined Saints 
Never Surrender, a hard- 
core rock band, as their 
new drummer in the fall 
of 2007. Already solidly 
established in the Fort 




Wayne music scene and 
grabbing the attention of 
fans across the country. 
Saints Never Surrender 
has become the focus of 
Witzigreuter's plans. "I 
start touring fiill time in 
Saints Never Surrender in 
June," he said, referring to 
their summer tour plans 
that will take the band 
from Florida to South 
Dakota through June and 
luly. 'Touring is what 
my life will mainly consist 
of- When I'm not on tour

with Saints Never Surren- 
der, I'll be out doing The 
Ready Set," he said. 
Despite a schedule full 
of practices and perfor- 
mances,- Witzlgreuter 
siill finds time to attend 
classes at IPFW, where 
he enrolled in January af- 
ter graduating early from 
Homestead High School. 
"I had enough crediis to 
graduate, and 1 knew that 
in (he summer I would 
sian louring, so it seemed 
lo be a better choice to 
^^llrk and go to college full 
iimt' for the semester," he 
said, comparing his op- 
lions between staying in 
high school and starting 
college. 

Mizigreuter, may be a 
prominent memberof the 
Fon Wayne music scene, 
bui he does not want that 
to limit him to just stay- 
ing and playing here. "I 
want to avoid playing in 
FonWayne too much. I'd 
rather be playing show/s 
in other cities and states," 
he said. Catch him while 
you can, whether it's v«th 
The Ready Set or Saints 
Never Surrender, or even 
btideandgroom, as he has 
not ruled out a reunion in 
the future with Alvarado, 
because this teenager 
may very well have saved 
a djing music scene.

Sciences sent a repre- 
sentative to present the 
awards to their students 

Most of the present- 
ing faculty had had direct 
interaction ivith the stu- 
dents and gave interest- 
ing anecdotes about the 
student's scholastic hab- 
its and petsonal trails. 

Awards were given 
in the form of plaques, 
checks, and 'symbolic 
envelopes' as coined by 
Jason Summers from the 
In tern a do nal Language 
and Culture Studies de- 
partment - the checks 
hadn't arrived yet. 

What was truly spe- 
cial to this event was 
the honest respect the 
instructors gave to their 
students. 

Although these dedi- 



cated faculty members 
are used to leaching stu- 
dents every day, the rec- 
ognized scholars were 
especially noted for their 
persevertmce, their curi- 
osity, and their deep in- 
terest in learning. 

As Dean Upman not- 
ed in his closing remarks, 
"Good students do not 
materialize from thin 
air." 

Faculty and families of 
the students were asked 
to stand to be recognized 
for their support, and, in 
an especially thoughtful 
gesture, guests were al- 
lowed to take the fresh 
flowers that decorated 
the tables as a memento 
of the evening.

On the coun, who is going to hit 
from the outsider? Who is going to be a 
permanent ball stopper in the middle? 
Hell, who am I going lo have lo cringe 
at regarding ball control? 

On the sidelines, who is going 
to always be smiling? Who is going 
lo be the clapping- nazi? And what 
will it be like without errant yells of 
"Yyhhooooosst!" before a serve? 

Overall, what will life be like without 
seven guys who have done amazing 
things for IPFW and always done so 
with a smile, a laugh and without taking 
it all too seriously? 

Yes, they faltered when ihe pressure 
was actually on them. I don't think that 
any of them will argue with that. But 
why in the world would thai be their 
legacy? 

Anybody who has seen them play, 
anybody who knows them personally 
will carry their oivn distinct, and I'm 
betting, positive memories of these 
guys. And that is what we should 
remember them for. 

From the first time I watched any 
of them play, on January 28, 2005 
in a loss to Lewis, you always had a 
feeling that the original core group of 
five (then including Mike Morici) was 
going to be something special. Later 
that year I cheered against Macias as 
IPFW bounced him and Findlay from 
the postseason. The next year. I did Ihe 
same to Ainsworth as the Mastodons 
dumped Rutgers during a big final 
weekend at Gales. And last year, I 
remember very vividly wondering 
"who the hell is Jason Yhost " when 
he appeared from nowhere as service 
specialist and was in the starting lineup 
a few aces later. 



I will remember these seven seniors 
for those things. 

I will remember the first time 1 
interviewed any of them. Brock Ullrich 
sure was cool and collected the first 
time I stuck a recorder in his face 
when he was a freshman. Goofy? Yeah. 
Serious? Never. He was Brock. The 
same Brock that ripped Pepperdine 
in the 2007 National Semis, the same 
Brock that adorns a towel on his head 
on thesidelineswhenwe are down and 
spikes his hair in crazy ways when the 
momentum is going our way. 

I'll know that C.l. was always wilting 
to swing by for a quick interview 
anytime I needed just one more quote 
for a story and I'll always know that he 
made having the mens volleyball beat 
during their first Final Four run the 
easiest thing in the world. 

And I'll always know that two of 
these guys, whiie never playing as 
much as their peers, spent four great 
years at IPFW filling hvo of the most 
crucial roles, as I see it, on this mens 
volleyball team. In the form of Mike 
Daiga (Class of 2006), Steve Rogers 
was a true team player who was always 
smiling and always happy to be part of 
this program. 

And Dan McNemey? What really 
would a match be like if he was not 
there? Loud, vocal, leading and the 
life of the party in the Gates Center, it 
will be awf\jlly quiet (and not in a good 
way) without him. 

We all have our memories of 
the seven of you. You all have your 
memories of each other and your time 
at IPRV. Good, bad, funny and even 
sad, that is your legacy. And it is worth 
remembering.

Outside of Kook, Pliske 
and Morici. the Mastodons 
will return six players with 
varied experience. Corey 
Stewart and Nate Berg will 
be juniors while Kevin Gon- 
calves, Daryl Shank and Ben 
Duck^vorth will help make 
up a sophomore class. 

Jonathan Meyer will like-

5th Annual IPFW Intramural Golf Outing 

@ Canterbury Green 

IXiesday, April 22nd marked the 5th Annual IPFW Intramural golf outing, and 
the weather couldn't have been better. "With 44 participants and some spon- 
sors, this turned out to he a cost effective single day event for IPFW, ' remarked 
athletics director, Ron Clark. Tee off began at 11:45 with teams High Life ( IPFW 
students, Adam Miller and Kevin Holtzciaw) vs. team Key Stone (IPFW students. 
Cory Good and Kasey Conlon.) It wouldn't have been a tournament without some 
healthy teasing from the players. ' They might as well hand me the trophy now 
- this is in the bag,"joked Conlon.

Communicator Athlete of the Year 



!^mm 



In 2005, The Communicator 
began naming both make and 
female Athletes of the Year. That 
year, it was a pair of volleyball 
players, Matt Zbyszewski and 
Fabiana Souza that earned the 
honor. The following year, Souza 

won again 

I alongside C.J. 
I Macias. 

We return to 
I that tradition 
this year, naming 
just one solo 
I Communicator 
Athlete of the 
Year and for the first time, a non- 
volleyball honoree. It was virtually 
a no-brainer to name Johrma 
Lewis- Carlisle to this position. 

She averaged 19.5 points per 
game during her senior season, 
which ranked fourteenth in the 




nation. She was the highest- 
ranking Mastodon basketball 
player in any statistical category. 
She also led the team in steals with 
56 and was second on the team in 
rebounding, averaging four. 

Although this is not an all- 
inclusive award, Lewis-Carlisle 
has been a scoring machine 
since the get-go. After a stellar 
freshman season, she led IPFW in 
scoring during 14-of-28 games as 
a sophomore. And of course, led 
the team in scoring as a junior and 
senior. Also during her time, she 
was always met with postseason 
honors. She was a member of the 
All-Independent Newcomer Team 
as a freshman, the second team 
as a sophomore and first team 
as a junior. As a senior, finally in 
a conference, she was part of the 
Summit League First Team and in 



high consideration to be named 
the conference's female player of 
the year 

The most important thing thai 
Lewis-Carlisle can lay claim to is 
being the most recent poster child 
oflPFW athletics. 

Now that the school has 
conference affiliation with the 
Summit League, it is Johnna 
Lewis-Carlisle who leads the 
school in that capacity. The school 
will have to transition again next 
year, but It is her vrfio will be 
remembered as the leader of the 
pack in the school's first year with ,■ 
a conference next to its name. 

For all that she has done and 
accomplished since coming to 
IPFW, there is no doubt that 
Lewis-Carlisle is the only pick as 
the 2007-200B Communicator 
Athlete of the Year. 



This lanUng is based on production 
stadstical analysis of IPFW's male and femalS 
athletes by Spons Editor Dan Vance The tesulta 
are completely subjective and those exclusively of 
The Communicator.

IPFW volleyball's season and hopeful nm for a 
third sirBight Final Four came crashing down with 
a 3-2 loss on Friday night. After two straight trips to 
the nation's top stage with many of the same players, 
this IPFW team finished 12-15, losers of their last 
four. 

And for seven very special seniors, that is how 
your college careers ended. That is not your legacy. 
That is not how you will be remembered. 

This group will go down as one of the best teams, 
of any kind, in the history of this institution. Josh 
Stewart, Brock Ullrich. Dan McNerney and Steve 
Rogers have shown that there are kids who buy into 
programs will be true team players for all four years. 
Graydon Ainsworlh has fiUed the most important 
role in the program by moving in at setter in 2006. 
And CI. Macias and lason Yhosi have- transferred in, 
hit hard and restored faith in a program that had its 
share of struggles in years before. 

These seven seniors have left an amazing mark 
on this school, their sport, each other and every fan 
who has watched them over the past two, three or 
four years.

And so it comes to an end 



By DAN VANCE

It wasn't supposed to end like this. That is the first 
thing that the men's volleyball team will tell you. 

They were never supposed to be a 5-seed. never 
supposed to be in Chicago to start the MIVA tourna- 
ment. But somehow they were and somehow one of 
IPFW's greatest teams ever ends their run without 
even a sniff of a winning record. 

As with six times previous this season, the Mast- 
odons forced a fifth game only to fall short. After be- 
ing down 2-1 (30-27, 28-30, 30-27), the Mastodons 
rallied back with their All-MIVA senior leaders C.J. 
Macias and lason Yhost and won game four 30-25 
before falling 20-18 in the fifth game. 

And just like last year's National Title Game, it was 
a service error that ended it all. 

It was not fitting, not ironic nor expected. It was 
simply a poignant end for a team who overachieved 
twice to get to the Final Four and underachieved from 
the first serve in 2008. 

Yhost led the team vrith 20 kills while usual pri- 
mary weapon, Macias, was crucial on defense w/ith 12 
digs. Fellow seniors Josh Stewart, Graydon Ainsworth 
and Brock Ullrich helped lead too. Stewart had seven 
blocks, Ainsworth led with 51 assists and three ser- 
vice aces while Ullrich, the third best server in school 
history, added one more ace to his career numbers. 

Those five, along with Dan McNerney and Steve 
Rogers will now exit IPFW after establishing a strong 
legacy. Just two starters (freshman Oliver Kook and 
sophomore Matt Pliske} will return to a team who will 
have just one senior in 2009 in I ibero/ service special- 
ist Mike Morici. Morici was originally a member of 

this senior class. k. ^km r,
