The finl roll lemeater meeliag d the IPFW Sbideot Senate ScpL S was full of 
conCroveny. The controversy arcse over two smendmenb and an sppro[ria(ion 
bill thai had been passed during on emergency meeting of the Executive Com- 
mitlee. The meeting was held via telephone on June 23.

Even though the Student Governmenl Constitution requires monthly summer 
meelingB to be called by ttie vice president, the Senate mel only once during the 
summer Student Government President Don Gorncy said theemergcncy meeting 
was used because senate meetings had not been planned for the rest of the sum- 

The first amendment, concerning Shi dent Union Board of Governors 
documentatioa, had to be postponed until tlie next meeting became it uiculd 
change the constitution. 

The second bill was an amendment to tl)e liylaws staUng that the Senate and 
SUBOG would meet at least twice a month during the full and spring semesters. 
Thecurrentbylaw states that thesenateandSUBOG shall meet weekly. 

"'It might be too easy to fall badi and say we only have to meet twice a month." 
said Todd Slurgill, SUBOG chairman. Ron DIehl, senator, said that hvlcc a month 
meetings would "bring up the necessity (or executive session decisions " 

The final acbon taken by the executive committee was a hill to appropriate MJS 
lor the purchase Ola button- making machine lor the Senate 

Gomey originally suggested that the button maker be purchased by SUBOG, 
which began research to determine whether expenses would be recovered and 



money made In the future on such a major eipendlture. 

Gomey wanted the machine sooner than SUBOG could act on it because he 
wanted to make bullons [or M stuffed mastodons that arrived in early August. He 
said it would have cost at leastI204 to buy the butlonsluteadrfappraxImBtelyCS 
to make them. 

The machine wasalso wanted for other promotional Ideas thatwere expected to

Controversy fUls meeting 



The IPFW Students' Government 
wasted iillle lime to stir up some con- 
troversy this semester, 

Aiier a relatively quiel, but produc' 
live, year during Tom Harris' ad- 
mlnislralton, three resolutions were 
Inlroduced at the aludenl senate 
meeting, Sept, 5. Nothing Is wronB with 
introducing three pieces ol legislation, 
however, they were acted upon in an 
emergency meeling of the executive 
council in June. 

Don Gorney, student body president, 
said the measures were okay as long as 
the senate approved the legislation al ils 
regular meeting. Therein lies the 
problem No meeting ol the senate was 
called until between the middle ot June, 
when the emergency meeting look place, 
and the beginning of September. 
According to its own bylaws, the senate 
is supposed to meet monthly during the 
summer. II didn't. 

Gorney said the emergency meeling 
was called because the senate had an 
opportunity to purchase a button maker 
as a way at raising money. At that same 
meeting, the executive council voted to 
amend the senate's bylaws. It also voted 
jo have all action taken by the Student 



Union Board of Governors approved by 
the student body president. 

Following the Sept. 5 meeting. Gorney 
said the amendment and the action 
aimed at SUBOG shouldn't have been 
considered at an emergency meeting, 
because that action could have waited. 

The button maker has been purchased, 
and the students' government is making 
buttons. 

Soraesenators have called for Gorney 
and Don Lee. student body vice 
president, to be impeached. Impeach- 
ment may be a little drastic. 

Yes, Lee may have violated the very 
bylaws he is supposed to follow by not 
calling three senate meetings during the 
summer Lee and Gorney should chalk 
the incident up to experience. They 
should, in the future, ensure they are 
following the bylaws whenever they take 

The senate mcmtters should stay in 
communication with Gorney and Lee so 
they understand what is going on. 

Members of the senate must also 
realize, they are representing the 
students interests, even though most 
members of iJie student twdy are 
apathetic to the senate and what it tries 
to accomplish.

Cricket keeps 
Nancy awake 



By MARK RUSSELL 

L.A.'nmeiSyadicale 

Since thia column only 
addresses llseU to the 
substantive Issues, we now 
take up the matter of the 
White House phantom 
cricket — which the media 
has made the chirp heard 
round the world. 

A cricket had wtrked Its 
way Into the White House 
ventilating system and made 
enough noise to keep Mrs. 
Reagan awake at night The 
cricket didn't wake the 
president — but then, 
wounded hyenas wouldn't 
wake the president. 

News accounts said that no 
one actually saw Uw 
phantom cricket — it was 
only heard. We'll never know 
If It really was a cricket In 
the ventllabng system or if 
G. Gordon Uddy Is now 
working for the Democrats. 

Over the years there have 
been sccounU of tbe White 
House being tiaunted. Hajry 
Truman ooce claimed be 
saw Lincoln walking down 
the hall. Perhapa what 
Nancy heard wot the 
tioUlng of Ulytsea S. 
Grant's Icecubes. 




Former President Harrr 

TTomao ooce claimed be u«

Or perhaps these strange 
noises marked the return of 
Jimmy Carter's killer

Sometimes It seems that 
everyone who Isn' t spending

Jogging. If you're one of the 
"guilty" ones — don't be. 
Although Jogging Is an ex- 
cellent form o( eierdM for 
some, it's not For everyone. 

"Walking may be the Ideal

Indianapolis cardiologist 
"Like jogging, walking

Walking exercises your

you should wear suitably

The building gets ila
