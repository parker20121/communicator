President plans 

Able is looking to better 
the already well-organized 
-Intramural programs on 
campus. Governed by the 
Joint Athletic Committee, 
he feels that this is one 
area where many students 
take an active interest 
in the activity program. 
Working with the estab- 
lished Intramural pro- 
grams, he hopes to expand 
and incorporate other 
sports and activities. Able 
would like to involve as 
many people in as many 
activities as possible. 

The new administration 
plans to continue such pre- 
vious projects as voter 
registration, student eval- 
uations of faculty, a stu- 
dent directory, and the 
Free University, Able will 
continue the search for an

announced by Dr. Charles 
Bolyard, Director of the 
Academic Development and 
Counseling Center, Room 
106, Main Educational

Results of the National 
Teacher Examinations are 
used by many large school 
districts as one of several 
factors In the selection of 
new teachers and by 
several states for certifi- 
cation or licensing of 
teachers. The school sys- 
tems and state departments 
of education which use the 
examination results are 
listed in an NTE leaflet en- 
titled Score Users which 
may be obtained from Dr. 
Bolyard. 

On the day of testing, pro- 
spective teachers may take 
the Common Examinations 
which measure their pro- 
fessional preparation and 
general educational back- 



ground and a Teaching Area 
Examination which mea- 
sures their mastery of the 
subject they expect to 
teach. 

Prospective teachers 

should contact the school 
systems in which they seek 
employment for specific 
advice on which examina- 
tions to take and on which 
dates they should be taken.

The I-PU Comimmicator

COMMUNITY NEWS: 
A COMMENTARY 



by Stan Jones 



New economics degree 
to be granted at I-PU 



Commission revamped 

Last week Mayor Lebamoff apjjuinted six new members 
to the Metropolitan Human Relations Commission. They 
were Mrs. Sue Wilson, Mrs. Theresa Miller, Mrs. Luella 
Bishop, Gary Lotter, Ellas Escobedo, and Louis Din- 
widdle. Under a new city ordinance; reducing the com- 
mission's size from nine to seven with the Mayor ap- 
pointing six and the City Council one, James Stler was 
named to the board by the Council. 

With the recent resignation of James Bryant as Metro 
Director, the new Commission will have to secure a 
new director plus the appropriate staff. 

With the reorganization of the commission, the resig- 
nation of Bryant, the small tiff between the Council and 
the Mayor over the appointment procedure and the history 
of past actions, the new commissioawi^ll most probably 
have a similar success story. (?) 

County Council Closes Irene Byron 

Recent discussions at the County Council hearings 
on the proposed 1973 budget have brought to Jlght many 
items such as the possibility of merging the Tiealth de- 
partments. A copy of the City Council's efforts to regu- 
late the service station dilemma was proposed but for- 
tunately fell on unresponsive ears. 

Other actions of the Council were to reduce the budget 
for the Irene Byron Hospital to such a level as to make 
it non-functional after the first of the year. The fact 
that the hospital is one of the few Institutions In the state 
that deals primarily with respiratory dlseasecases seemed 
to have tittle weight on the budget decision. The county 
needs the hospital, unless of course some cure has been 
found for tuberculosis, emphesema and other respira- 
tory diseases. What will happen to the patients now in 
the hospital? What will happen to future patients? Hope- 
fully the council will reconsider, 



United Way campaign begins 

Last Saturday the United Way of Allen County launched 
its 1972-73 campaign with opening ceremonies at the 
City-County Building and a downtown parade. Nearly 
30 units panlclpated in the parade with the Bishop Luers 
marching band and the U.S. Navy Reserve Color Guard 
leading. With the opening of the new campaign, some 
2,000 volunteers will begin to raise some $2.97 million 
to finance the 32 United Way agencies. The United Way 
cannot achieve Its goal without your help and the help 
of many other concerned citizens,. , 



HEW proposal rejected 



Persons interested in the 
study of economics for ca- 
reer possibilities no wean 
earn the degree of bachelor 
of science In business ad- 
ministration with a concen- 
tration in economics at Ind- 
iana-Purdue University at 
Fort Wayne, The new de- 
gree program recently was 
approved for this campus 
by the Indiana Higher Edu- 
cation Commission, 

According to Dr. D,A. 
Stonebarger, chairman of 
the Division of Business and 
Economics, the program is 
designed to provide back- 
ground in economics and 
business for business and 
government careers and to 
prepare those students who 
wish to pursue graduate 
study. 

Dr. Moonsong Oh, chair- 
man of economics, said that 
there is an increasing 
demand by business and 
government for economics 
majors because of rising 
needs for professional e- 
conomlc research, investi- 
gation, inalysls and inter- 



It seems once again the federal bureaucratic quagmire 
known as the Department of Health, Education and Wel- 
fare was ready to encircle its strangling hands around 
the Neighbor Redevelopment Program. The prospect 
of a new HEW project brought mostly a poor response 
from a meeting of the Project Area Committee. The 
general tone of the meeting was, "We don't want to 
be fooled again." 

It seems the HEW image is a bit tarnished In this 
area, leading some to question its usefullness. It also 
seems quite evident that the power of HEW has grown 
In recent years, but few have realized this. The power 
of HEW, in many Instances, tends to be abusive and bung- 
ling rather than useful. 

City Light runs deficit again 

Hopefully, with the disclosure of a $160,000 deficit 
at City Light, the city administration will take steps 
to correct this dismal situation. The prospect of ale- 
vlating the situation seems small, however, as the City 
Council and administration are reluctant to sell the 
thing to a private firm which would take it off the tax 
rolls. Anyway, the City Light plant and office make such 
a nice place to put local party faithfuls. 

All in all. the problems will continue to be "explained" 
away only to resurface somehwere else under a dif- 
ferent name. If the idea of supporting an inefficient 
government agency by your taxes is appalling, then the 
only thing to do is to let the city administration -ind 
council know of you^. disfavor, again and again If needed. - 



pretation of economics. 

Requirements for the de- 
gree Include 24 or more se- 
mester hours In economics 
plus general education and 
business core require- 
ments. Dr, Oh said 1,200 
students were enrolled In 
various economicscourses 
at the local campus during 
the 1971-1972 fall and spr- 
ing semesters. 

Among those career poss 
ibilltles for the Interpret- 
ation of news. Dr. Oh point- 
ed out. He added that fam- 
iliarity with econonnic prin- 
ciples is almost indispen- 
sable In the field of Inter- 
national relations such as 
foreign service, in agencies 
of the United Nations and as 
an employee of a multina- 
tional corporation. 

Full-time faculty persons 
in the department of econ- 
omics include, in addition 
to Dr. Oh, Dr, G.M. Bullion, 
Dr. Stuart Lynn and Alex- 
ander Sunday. There are 
also several assoclatefac- 
ulty members.

Editoriallq 
Speaking 



The Dual Universitv 

Two English depts. 



to teach one language? 



As of yet no one has shown 
that the Indiana and Purdue 
fitudenrs speak different 
dialects of the English lan- 
guage. Yet I-PU's aca- 
demic structure In English 
would lead one to believe 
this is the case. 

The basic requirement for 
incoming freshmen is Eng- 
lish composition. Students 
show their proficiency In 
writing the English lang- 
uage in these classes. 

The existence of two sep- 
arate department hints 
that a student must follow 
one set of grammer rules 
if he seeks a degree through 
Indiana and another if he is 
in a Purdue program. 

Granted that there are 
historical differences 
in the methods of teaching 
comp used by both institu- 
tions. Also the Indiana de- 
partment specializes In Ut- 



Academh grievances 



erature and the Purdue de- 
partment offers advanced 
writing courses. 

Differences far great- 
er than these have been 
resolved in other depart- 
ments, notably mathe- 
matics and psychology. And 
there Is no logical reason 
for separate literature and 
writing departments at I- 
PU. 

Separate departments 
only serve to further con- 
fuse an already confused 
situation. 

The two English depart 
ments should be merged yet 
this year. That institution 
that traditionally draws 
more upper-level English 
students should be given the 
mission for administrative 
purposes. 

Or must the departments

10 it 4 iJ O Q O W ^^ ^^"'^ lA^rtia^^ I 



Complain too loudly and 
you stop a promotion 



Ic is fine to accuse a sys- 
tem of Imolerance, but 
there must be support for 
such charges. The follow- 
ing example, supported by 
documented evidence, de- 
fends this accusation. 

Last spring, a required 
course for seniors In that 
major was the center of 
much controversy. The 
professor was accused of 
many things, both serious 
and trivial. 

One majorcharge was that 
the professor did not teach. 
Her anitude was that "You 
should know It by now; if 
you don't, that's your tough 
luck.' 

Secondly, no equitable 
grading standards were 
used. One paper was re- 
turned as ungradable In 
both form and content. Half 
a dozen spelling mistakes 
were corrected and the 
paper received a very high 
grade. 

The major grievance 
centered around the pro- 
fessor's flagrant misuse 
of employment re- 
commendations, a must for 
graduates in this field. In 
one instance, she threat- 
ened a bad recommendation 
unless a student cut his hair 
to meet 'acceptable stand- 



ards." 
The tragedy of tills case 
was the treatment the stu- 
dents received at the hands 
of the divisional chairman. 
After two lengthy sessions 
with the entire class, he 
could give at best two rea- 
sons why the students 
should keep silent: 

1. The whole affair was 
upsetting the professor. 
The upset suffered by 
40 seniors soon to hit an 
over-crowded job market 
was of no concern, ob- 
viously. 

2. Word of the griev- 
ances should not reach his 
superiors as she was being 
considered for promotion. 
Something like this (griev- 
ance) could prevent a "Fine 
professor from receiving 
much deserved pro- 
motion." 

The treatment the stu- 
dents received Is literally 
sickening. When a student 
pays $750 a year for an ed- 
ucation, he certainly de- 
serves better than that. 

This Is but one example 
of the system ignoring 
criticism from "non-pro- 
fessionals," i.e., students. 
Legitimate student griev- 
ances can find no place in 
such a system. 



Opinions expressed in the Editorially Speaking column 
are those of the editorial staff. We recognize the re- 
sponslblUty to print differing opinions. 



In a way, we could give 
the credit for the awaken- 
ing of a new social con- 
science to the young middle 
class Whites. Certainly It 
was they who early lent 
their support to the a- 
wakenlng sense of identity 
in Che Black. Later, when 
the Chlcano began stirring, 
and the Indian began to be 
heard, the young White was 
there to help. 

These youths were (ac- 
cording to Psychologist 
Kenneth Kenlston) sincere, 
highly dedicated, and in- 
telligent people. The work 
they did at the time they 
did it could not have been 
done by any other people. 
They taught, they Inspired, 
they led and they started Che 
minorities toward their 
rightful place in chls 
society. 

Because of this, we in- 
itially saw a great wave of 
awakening stirring across 
the land. This movement 
was held together by the 
commonality of life styles 
of the leaders. The young 
middle class Whites en- 
gaged themselves In a joy- 
ful celebration of awaken- 
ing. The mood was one of 
Jcyfulness even In time of 
sorrow, for the emotion 
guiding them was the e- 
motlon of life: love. The 
young Whites had found a 
meaning and a purpose for 
their lives. They had found 
an oasis In the spiritual 
desert of materialism. 

This rejoicing was short 
lived however, because for 
all their sincerity and de- 
dication, they were out- 
siders. As the skills of the 
minorities developed to the 
point of leadership 
abilities, the young Whites 
found themselves being 
eased into the background. 
The roles were shifted to 
the point where the Black 
or Chlcano insisted on 
making his own decisions 
for his own people. The 
young White suddenly felt 
himself slipping back Into 
the dreadful pit of irrelev- 
ancy and insignificance 
which haunts the soul of 
man. 

During this period, the 
"movement" began to de- 
velop various form.s which 
were quickly perceived to 
be actually difierent 
"movements." The former 



continuity had been Inter- 
rupted. The Black leader 
was concerned only with the 
needs of the Black people. 
The Chlcano worked only 
for "La Raza." 

Some young Whites re- 
acted by resuming their 
roles as members of the 
middle class; some chose 
the stereotyped roles a- 
scribed to "Hippies." 
Others tried to continue the 
old roles and gathered 
around them small groups 
of minority members will- 
ing to follow them rather 
than the indigenous lead- 
ers—Often the purpose of ■ 
these groups was to oppose 
the efforts of the minor- 
ity-led groups. Still others 
decided to try and awaken 
their own people to the 
needs of the world; in 
essence these took the 
movement Into the suburbs. 
And this is where we find 
ourselves today: seeing the 
various special-interest 
groups clamoring for their 
own cause. The commonal- 
ity is not readily apparent 
at the momencasthe groups 
concentrate on the growing 
awareness of their unique 
identity and needs. They 
see the distinct differences 
between the groups and, 
for the moment, these dif- 
ferences seem the em- 
phasis. 
However, the existence of 
special-interest groups can 
be just another phase in 
the evolution of our country 
toward reaching its true 



potential of human great- 
ness. As the special- 
interest groups become 
comfortable in their 
uniqueness, they may well 
begin to reach out to the 
other groups In their 
acknowledgment of com- 
mon humanity and common 
destiny. The concept of 
coalition between the re- 
sultantly peer-level groups 
on Issues of common In- 
terest can help to bring 
about such a necessary de- 
velopment. 
Such a development will 
not be automatic, however; 
It will have to become the 
conscious goal of everyone. 
The minorities are going 
to have to develop a full 
sense of the respons- 
ibilities which their newly 
won ( or acknowledged) 
rights have Imposed upon 
them. They are going to 
have to take the initiative 
In Che communication of 
their needs, desires, goals. 
Identity, and programs In 
order to allow the major- 
ity culture to understand 
and permit the growth pro- 
cess to continue. If Che 
maturation of the 
mlnoricies is not fully 
understood by the majority 
culture, that culture may 
well re-enact their history 
of genocide sparked by a 
fear and intolerance of the 
unknown (peoples). The 
motivation for such a 
change must be that of love

the FORUM 

This week's topic: Abortion 



Levison ^enlightened;' 
points need discussing 



The approach taken by 
Cathryn Levison to the a- 
bortion controversyiscer- 
tainly one of more enlight- 
enment and rationale than 
those frequently expressed 
by other viewpoints and was 
a welcome relief from the 
e m o 1 1 o n a 1 ly sensational 
pieces recently published 
by the COMMUNICATOR. 

However, while Levlson's 
article was perhaps more 
logically presented and co- 
hesive than certain com- 
mentaries, several points 
were stated with which Is- 
sue can, and should, be ta- 
ken. 

Levison suggests Chat 
there is a definite correla- 
tion between unwanted 
children and those children 
who are abused or battered. 
She further states chat par- 
ents who are not desirous 
of having children do not 
display the usual affection- 
ate attachment character- 
istic of parents. Whilethese 
assertions are no doubt 
correct, the assumption 
that such conditions pre- 
clude circumstances under 
which an abused or unwant- 
ed child would be better off 
dead Is falacious. 

Reply to Levinson 

Certainly, the fact that a 
child may be destined to 
suffer a difficult life does 
not mean that the child 
should be prevented from 
life. Mere human intelli- 
gence, In all Its fallibility, 
cannot hope to determine 
when a child would be more 
fortunate to die than to live. 

It is likewise difficult to 
accept Levlson's statement 
that "for the sake of the 
child, I am not in favor of 
compulsory pregnancy.," 
Understandably, c o m p u 1- 

Orthogon.. 



sory pregnancy Is an unfor- 
tunate situation for a wo- 
man CO face. Yet, abortion 
is more than unfortunate, 
for it Is much more conse- 
quential. 

Pregnancy, while uncom- 
fortable and painful, and 
perhaps Inconvenient as 
well. Is of short duration. 
Nine months of Incapacita- 
tion may seem an eternity 
to the pregnant woman, but 
eventually, the nine months 
are over and the woman Is 
free of the burden of car- 
rying the child. With Che al- 
ternative of adoption, the 
woman is free of the child 
for the rest of her life. 

Pregnancy does not last 
forever, but abortion is ir- 
revocable. Once an abortion 
is performed, the effect u- 
pon the fetus endures for 
infinity, and no amends can 
be made. Pregnancy may 
well be involuntary servi- 
tude tor some women, but 
abortion is nothing less 
than pre-natal homicide. 
Hence, Levlson's stand that 
she Is "for the sake of the 
child" is not easily recon- 
cilable with her stand en 
aborclon. 

Undeniably women have che 
righc c o control their own 
bodies, but they cannot In 
justice control the bodies 
of other s, even if those o- 
cher bodies are contain- 
ed within their own. All 
people have the right to fol- 
low the dictates of a free 
will, but when chat will in- 
fringes upon the right of a- 
nother to live, the freedom 
Co carry out the will ceases. 
Subsequently, no one has 
Che right to destroy life, 
even that life which is ex- 
istent in a child yet unborn,

and it must beaccomplish- 
ed in a spirit of full com- 
munication. 

And where does this leave 
the young middle class 
White who has given so 
much and found so little 
appreciation? Sime not 
wise enough to step out of 
the way at the proper time 
wIU have grown bitter at 
being pushed cut, and will 
have returned to their 
world cold to any continuing 
social change endeavors. 
They will forever mis- 
understand the reasons for 
which they were replaced. 
But Che greater number will 
become equal partners in 
the continuing movement. 
They will be operating from 
the base of their own 
uniqueness rather than 
from a temporarily as- 
sumed minority identity ■ 



Concepcs such as "cul- 
curally deprived" will be 
replaced by concepts of 
"culturally different." The 
classrooms will be able to 
tolerate children who are 
"different." More import- 
antly, our society will be- 
come more consistent in 
crying to live up to Its 
stated principles because it 
will be viewed from various 
perspectives. Hypocrisies 
will no longer be able to 
perpetuate themselves free 
from critical analysis. 
Love and tenderness will 
become acceptable and 
comfortable for our daily 
personal interactions with 
each other. In accepting 
our uniqueness we will 
acknowledge our common- 
ality — both In our human 
and in our spiritual 
ex'srence. 



Abort ton issue is dean 
is fetus a iiuman ? 



For many years I have lis- 
tened to both sides of the 
abortion issue. Illstenedto 
the pros and che cons, never 
really commenting ex- 
cept to say that 1 didn't ex- 
actly like the Idea of abor- 
tion but that I didn't consi- 
der it my business what 
someone else did. 

However in recent weeks 
the Issue has become crys- 
tal clear in my mind and 
now I find it hard to shrug 
off. The event Chat finally 
movea me to action was the 
September 1, 1972 Issue of 
the Indiana-Purdue Comm- 
unicator. The three articles 
by Souder, Martinez, and 
Levison ran the gamut from 
humanistic and enlightened 
(Souder), 1 rr ele va ntand 
meaningless (Martinez), to 
frightfully illogical (Le- 
vison). 

As I see it, the statement 
by Mark Souder argued the 
basic issue of whether or 
not a fetus is a human being 
and therefore entitled to 
protection by the law. Al- 
though we may not agree 
that Souder "proved" his 
point, at least he was at- 
tempting to argue what Is 



most certainly che key Is- 
sue. The ancillary consid- 
erations, such as whether 
or not a woman has che 
right to control her body, 
are noteable. However, they 
are of practically no signi- 
ficance when we are argu- 
ing the basic right of life. 
In my opinion noone, che 
state included, hasthe "ri- 
ght" to decide whether an- 
other person lives or dies. 
Yet people do have the "po- 
wer" to decide whetheran- 
ocher lives or dies, hence 
we have murder perpecrat- 
ed by the state or by Indi- 
viduals. War, for example, 
is an Instance of che power 
Co commit murder. And now 
c h a n k s to medical techno- 
logy, a wom.an hasthe pow- 
er (but noc che right) to ab- 
ort her unborn child. 

I must point out at this 
point chac abortion as mur- 
der Is my own opinion. My 
main argumenc In this art- 
icle, then. Is chat in dis- 
cussing the issue, we 
should speak CO che question 
of the humanessornon-hu- 
maness of the fetus. If we 
then agree chat the fetus 
Isn't human, we can allow 



abortion without anymore 
regrets than we have when 
we slaughter a cow. 

Although I have pretty well 
summed up my case, Levl- 
son's article intrigues me 
so much that I must reply 
to it. As I understand her 
thesis, a woman either has 
Che right to decide whether 
to continue being pregnant 
or noc or she Is compelled 
to be pregnane. This implies 
Chat someone other than her 
mace and herself is forcing 
her InCo performing a bio- 
logical function. By a fur- 
ther extension, a biological 
scace becomes "compell- 
ed" when we acquire che 
technology to scop It but 
don't. 

In the last analysis che 
quesclon becomes one of 
power-the power of che 
scate to prevent abortion, 
the power of the woman to 
have an abortion per- 
formed, andchepowerless- 
ness of the fetus to do any- 
thing at all, I wonder just 
how quick people would be 
to perform abortions If the 
fetus also had power?

Forum- analysis and human values 



by Mike Ellis, Forum Editor 



The FORUM Is a device for 
this academic community to 
use CO explore the data for 
any given issue, and the in- 
terpretations of this data. 
Abortion, civil disobe- 
dience, legalization of 
marajuana, and the war In 
Vietnam — these are exam- 
ples of the typical and ex 
pecced copies for debate. In 
these debates, however, 
many assumptions regarding 
che nature of Man and Wo- 
man are made without be- 
ing explicated. For ex- 
ample, when one argues the 
case for America's milita- 
ristic foreignpollcyfrom 
an economic base, he or 
she must assume that a hu- 
man being can be trans- 
formed Inco a fighting ma- 
chine. It is obvious that men 
and women can be trained to 
become killers, but the 
question arises: in che face 
of che universe and human- 
ity, what does it mean for 
one man or woman to kill 
another? What does this 
suggest about our essent- 
ial manhood or womanhood? 
The economist that argues 
for a m a k e-c h e-world- 
s a f e-for-democracy- b y- 
kllling-c o m m 1 e s foreign 
policy does not necessarily 
ask, or even care about, 
such questions. He cares 
about economics. 

I believe that exploration 
of such assumpclons Is of 
absoluce necessity if our 
arguments are to have re- 
levancy to huir.dn beings. 
We need to make war a hu- 
man issue. We need to make 
sexism a human issue. How 
can this be achelved? To 
answer this question we 
must examine our under- 



sunding of issues. 

If someone would come to 
me and tell me that eleven 
Olympic athletes were mur- 
dered, I would understand 
this in two ways. First, I 
would hear and know the 
facts, i.e. that chere were 
eleven athletes, chat these 
athletes were murdered. 
Second, I would "under- 
stand" what was told me in 
chac It would mean some- 
thing to the totality of my 
existence as a human being. 
In the first case, Che faces 
affecc me indirectly by be- 
ing a part of the earth-world 
upon which I live. In the se- 
cond, I am directly affected 
insofar as I posit, these 
facts as someching very 
much a part of mypersonal 
world. My world Is insep- 
arable from my state of 
mind, my physiological be- 
ing, my goals, my past. My 
understanding of issues, 
then, is complex, personal, 
vague, and affected by 
mood, I believe that of all 
the issues that confront us, 
most of them we examine 
and analyze In only the first 
way; that is, we try to ex- 
amine issues while remain- 
ing detached. Although this 
way of examining issues 
cannot render a full under- 
standing, it is to some ex- 
tent inescapable. We "sim- 
ply don't have the time to 
analyze every issue in the 
second mode. If there is an 
issue that we desire to un- 
derstand fully, however, we 
m use firsc examine our- 
selves in order to discover 
what this Issue can mean to 
us. 

The first mode of under- 
standing I shall call scien- 



tific, as ic Is a detached 
analysis; Che second mode, 
personal or human. Ids my 
bias chat reality lies In the 
second mode of understand- 
ing, and the first mode sup- 
plies only the evidence that 
we use tocreateand explain 
our own worlds. 

How can we make issues 
personal? We can do this by 
exploring the facets of our 
personal worlds. Because 
our physiological constitu- 
tion, our goals, and our past 
experiences are unique, 
what is left to examine here 
is first-order personal is- 
sues: fear, anxiety, gullc, 
love, loneliness, ecc. These 
are scates of mind that 
make our understanding of 
ourselves In relation to Is- 
sues possible. After dis- 
covering the meaning of 
these first-order issues, 
we can Chen proceed to 
define those issues raised 
through scientific analysis 
In terms of our personal 
life-worlds, 

, Beginning In- several 
weeks, this column will 
be devoted to the exam- 
ination of first-order hu- 
man issues; the rest of 
the FORUM will be left 
open to debate and dis- 
cussion of social and po- 
litical topics. Next week 
the issue will be che leji- 
allzatlon of marajuana. All 
members of the university 
are emphatically encour- 
aged to participate In the

erial or with replies to

Student Services 



New Union to offer recreation, services 



An interview with Dr. Joanne B. 
Lantz, Assistant Dean for Student 
Services Administration 



i: De^n Lantz, what will be 
■our role regarding the new 
itudent Union Building? 
\: I will serve in a super- 
iBlng role for the Union, 
■low that's kind of a broad 
:Iasslflcailon and I think it 
leeds to be redefined. Right 
low I'm looking at the pol- 
cles and procedures which 
ire going to govern the 
Jnlon Building. Maybe If I 
ell you a little bit about the 
Jnion Building you'll un- 
lerstand the kind of things 
we're dealing with. 



Q: What are you working on 
It the present? 
\: We're looking at faclll- 
:les and how they will oper- 
ite; we're looking at how 
:he building win be furnish- 
2d and decorated. Then 
lown the road we'll be look- 
ng at operating the Union. 



i: What will be located in 
he Union in terms of Ad- 
ninlstratlve offices? 
\: First of all there will be 
itudent Services offices, 
Tiy office and Dean Ulmer's 
)fflce, Placement and Fi- 
nancial Aids, the Academic 
development and Counsel- 
ng Center, the student act- 
vity coordinator's office. 
There will also be special 
services and the h e a 1 1 h 
services. 



Food services 



;: What other services will 
e found in the Union? 
.: Let me take It by floors 
;o we'll get a better picture 
if the building. On the 
ground floor Is the physical 
ctivlty room, a card and 
■-hess room, billiards, ping 
long, television lounge, and 
ood service. There's going 
be a kind of thing which 
vlU be for short service. 
Chat is in addition toadln- 
ng room and or cafeteria 
serving line. 



J: You mean there vrill be 
wo distinct facilities? 
»: They're side by side and 
hey're open, but they have 
'istinct areas, Thedecora- 
lon makes them distinct 
■ut at the same time Isco- 
'idinated. If you come in 
ind look through the whole 
oom you get the feeling 
hat they all match. 



;: How will food service be 
andled? 

\: We're looking at food 
ervice contractors at this 
oini and are getting propo- 
als from various service 



areas on what kinds of 
things they will offer. 
There will probably be a 
breakfast line In the morn- 
ing, hot lunch, and dinner 
In the evening. Now, there 
is some hope also that at 
Sunday noon there will be a 
hot food line. In other words 
the Union would be a place 
to go out for dinner on Sun- 
day, 



Breakfast to be served 

Q: Then the Union will offer 
breakfast for the "early 
birds?" 

A: Yes, With school start- 
ing here at 7:30 In the 
morning we have many peo- 
ple who get off work and 
come to a 7:30class. There 
are also many people who 
come In fora8:30classand 
might eat a hot breakfast. 
They might learn better If 
they'd have had a hot break- 
fast. Of cour s€, the jrlll 
area would be openfor cof- 
fee, donuts, sweet rolls, 
juice, that kind of thing. At 
least this is what is being 
anticipated at this point. 



Q: Is this being done Inan- 
ticlpatlon of dormitories? 
A: No, It's being done be- 
cause we feel that the food 
service should enhance our 
students. Since our school 
day runs so long hopefully 
we will have hot meals 3 
times a day. Also, because 
we have some lovely meet- 
ing rooms and a multi-pur- 
pose room. We would like 
to have the facilities to ser- 
vejuncheons an d ban quets. 

Q: What else will the Union 
offer In the way of lounges? 
A: There will be In addition 
to the television lounge on 
the first floor, the main 
lounge, a music lounge, and 
a smaller lounge for public 
use, which will also be used 
by Placement and Financial 
Aids. 

Q: Are there any large 
lounges? 

A: There's onemalnlounge 
that is divided up Into 
smaller conversation- 
al areas. There's also an 
information and sales desk 
which win sell candy and 
cigarettes and so on. and 
a coat checkroom. There's 
a large meeting r o o m on 
that floor and four small 
meeting rooms. 



Q: What will the second 
floor contain? 
A: On the second floor we 
have the student organiza- 
tion area. This will have the 




flexibility to have many 
separate partitioned of- 
fices. 



Q; How will this student or- 
ganization space be alloca- 
ted? 

A: This is one of the poli- 
cies that we need to dis- 
cuss, Thisis something that 
Is in the thinking stage at 
this point. 

Students' government 

Q; Which other offices are 
on the second floor? 
A: There's also the Stu- 
dents Government suite 
which has a conference 
room and a number of of- 
fices. The office of the co- 
ordinator Isalsolnthat 
area. 

Also on the second floor 
there is space for alumni 
offices, five meeting 
rooms, a student activity 
work area, and an arts and 
crafts area. 



Q: What is the student act- 
ivity work area? 
A: We're hoping to have this 
to make posters, or floats, 
or whatever. You will have 
a place to go do it. 



Q: There seems to be a dis- 
tinct purpose foreachfloor 
Is this the case? 
A: Yes, The ground floor Is 
for "food and fun", cards, 
television and so forth. The 
first floor Is formal meet- 
ing rooms, formal lounges, 
and offices. The second 
floor is the student offices. 



Q: What will the health ser- 
vice area feature? 
A: That is still in the plan- 



ning stages. We have hired 
a registered nurse who has 
worked at a college health 
center. lean t reallydelln- 
eate exactly what it will be. 
It is planned to have an of- 
fice reception area, an ex- 
amining room and a "cot 
room", where people are 
ill can be bedded down and 
rest room facilities. 



Q: When do you expect the 
Union to be opened? 
A: July 1. 



No union director 



Q: Will there be a full-time 
Union director? 
A: Our thinking at the pre- 
sent time is no, because It 
is not a Union Building In 
the sense that many are. We 
want it to be a part of the 



total University, not a sep- 
arate entity. T h 1 s is what 
I'm working on now, but I 
have not had it approved. 
My thinking is that there are 
areas that different groups, 
different individuals in the 
University would have the 
jurisdiction over. In other 
words, they would establish 
the priorities. But, as I say, 
I ha ve not discussed this 
with anyone. This is just my 
preliminary thinking. 



Q: During what hours will 
the Union be open? 
A: Probably from eight In 
the morning until 10 or U 
at night. Now I don't know 
about Saturday orSunday, 
but lean say that it will 
have the longest hours of 
any building on campus. 
I would guess that it would 
run a schedule very much 
like the library.

Roger Ford believes 
in total involvement 



Roger Lee Furd is no or- 
dinary I-PU student. In his 
second year of nursing, the 
25-year-old is not only a 
student, husband and father, 
but also President of Circle 
K, one of the most active 
organizations on campus. 

As with most students, 
Roger's reasons for at- 
tending college are not 
purely educational In the 
educational sense. He says 
he comes "To grow -not 
just in knowledge you get 
from books, but from the 
experience of personal In- 
teraction with students of 
different walks of life." 

Roger finds that Circle K 
allows him to do much of 
this growing because "Cir- 
cle K's entire reason for 
being is service to the cam- 
pus, the community, and the 
world." He claims thatbe- 
ing elected president of the 
local chapter Is his great- 
est college experience be- 
cause of the trust that the 
other members must have 
in him. 



When asked how students 
can make the most of col- 
lege, Roger said the best 
way is through "Total in- 
volvement In your school 
and campus life." He 
stressed that everyone 
"Get Involved." 

When Roger speaks of in- 
volvement, he speaks from 
experience. Being Circle K 
President, he finds himself 
Involved in numerous ser- 
vice activities, "I guess 
you could say I'm obsessed 
with it (Circle K)," Roger 
says. "This organization is 
more beneficial than any 
club I've seen." 

Describing the Circle K 
leader, one of the club's 
members said he Is sin- 
cere, outgoing and friendly. 
Roger labels himself as a 
"moderate," like many, 
being liberal on some things 
and conservative on others. 

Turning his attention to 
politics and the '72 elect- 
Ions, Roger said that "No 
party has a candidate that 



Is, 1 my : plnioii, of a cal- 
iber to be President. I'm a 
Kennedy supporter, butun- 
fortunaiely, they have a 
high death rate." 

As a-final thought to all 
people, Roger reflects: "In 
a time when our world Is a 
continuous hassle, I hope 
that through education and 
organizations like Circle K 
we can help bring peace to 
the world and health to our 
aiUng environment. 

A 1965 graduate of Ken- 
dallvIUe High School, Ro- 
ger Is the son of Mr. and 
Mrs, Robert Ford of Ken-

years In the U.S. Air Force 
as a medical ccrpsmrn. 

Roger, his wife Jeanette 
and their two children, Ro- 
ger and Michelle Marie, 
reside at 1434 St. Mary's

Study shows that 
college costs rising 



How much does it cost to 
go to college? It depends 
on what you have ro spend. 

The range of student ex- 
penditures on the Indiana 
University Bloomlngton 
campus points up the 
dilemma for parents try- 
ing to make plans for their 
children's education. 

But parents had better 
plan because a recent study 
of undergradutes indicates 
that almost 85 per cent of 
the single students rely 
heavily on financial as- 
sistance from their fam- 
ilies. I.e., parents and/or 
relatives, (Less than 40 per 
cent of married students 
cite this source, however.) 

Karl K, Hansmeier, now 
director of student 
financial aid at the Univer- 
sity of West Flordia at 
Pensacola, did the study 
of school and living costs 
for his doctoral disserta- 
tion at I.U, 

Although his study shows 
wide variation In spending, 
it offers valuable informa- 
tion for prospective stu- 
dents trying to plan 
budgets, 

Hansmeier found that for 
the first semester of the 
1970-71 school year, the 
range of expenses was from 
$783 to $6,126. The lower 
figure was spent by a sin- 
gle student, the higher by 
a married student with 
seven children. 

Married students 
spend more 

Th range for single stu- 
dents is not much more 
comforting — from $783 to 
ei4,U0. The higher figure 
was spent by a student who 
Indicated his father's 
annual income is more than 
&amp; 2 50. 000. 

Married students ex- 
penses ranged from eil,280 
to &amp;6,126, 

More valuable, perhaps, 
for budget planners are 
figures for the majority of 
students. Nearly 70 per 
cent of the single under- 
graduate students surveyed 
spent between $900 and 
&amp;1,699 in the first semester 

More than 75 per cent of 
the married men spent bet- 
ween &amp;1,400 and &amp;2,799, 

The average expenditure 
for single students was 
Bil,498; for married men, 
$2,390. 

Very few costs were fix- 
ed. However, tulttion for 
students enrolled for 12-17 
hours was $325 for Indiana 
residents, $745 for out-of- 
state students, 

Hansmeier's survey at- 
tempted to cover all living 
costs, including such things 
as c lothlngmalntenance, 
properly taxes, gifts, and 
contributions, baby sitting, 
and debt repayment. 



Hansmeier divided stu- 
dents into eight categories 
for his study. He separated 
men and women with sub- 
groups of each: organized 
(in fraternltle s-soror- 
Itles), living In town, living 
in residence halls. Married 
women were not included. 

Similar studies of I.U. 
students had been made in 
1940-41and 1951-52. Hans- 
meier used the earlier stu- 
dies for comparison. 

Doubles in 20 years 

Some of his findings were: 

—Single students spent al- 
most twice as much In 
1970-71 as m the 1951-52 
study. Married men's ex- 
penses more than doubled. 

— Single men now spend 
more than single women, a 
change from earlier 
studies. 

— Students in the new study 
spent a smaller percentage 
of their money for clothing 
than did earlier students, 

— Tuition and fees have 
replaced food as the largest 
single expense. 

— Single students spend an 
average of 4 1/2 times 
more than In 1951-52 (al- 
most 8 times more than In 
1940-41) for books, tuition, 
fees, supplies, and equip- 
ment for courses. 

Higher standard 
of living 

Hansmeier concluded, 
however, that not all the 
rise in expenses Is due to 
inflation. Students "appear 
to enjoy a higher level of 
living than did their prede- 
cessors," he said. 

Another aspect of the 
study was to identify the 
sources of income for stu- 
dents. 

In addition to relatives, 
sources of Income Included 
personal savings. Income 
and savings of wife, sum- 
mer employment, work on 
and off campus during 
school, scholarships, 
grants, fee remissions, 
loans, and military educa- 
tional benefits. 

Dr. Robert H, Shaffer, 
professor of education and 
of business administration 
at I,U., Bloomlngton, was 
faculty director for the 
study.

Music NotBM 

Jackson Brown 
takes it easy 



by Dave Hill 



The most Impressive de- 
but album I have heard for 
a long time Is the one re- 
leased by Jackson Browne. 

Until recently Jackson was 
a s e m l-o b s c u r e young 
songwriter, well respected 
In the music business, but 
virtually unknown to the 
public. Then last sprlngthe 
single released from this 
album hit it big. It was 
"Doctor My Eyes", and It 
deserved to be at the top of 
the "Top Forty" radio 
lists, because it was so 
much better than most of 
the junk being played. 

The song has a fast tempo, 
opening up with some rock- 
In g piano and driving bass 
lines, which are then joined 
by Jackson's great voice 
and David Crosby's nicely 
blended harmonies. Almost 
every time I heard "Doc- 
tor My Eyes" on the radio 
some stupid disc jockey 
would say: "Now here's 
David Crosby and Graham 
Nash with Jackson 
Browne." That always up- 
set me because Nash wasn't 
even on the record, and all 
Crosby did was sing har- 
mony in the chorus. 

All thesongsonthlsalbum 
are potential hit singles. 
There are ten songs, some 
in which Jackson only sings 
and plays his guitar. He 
carries this off well though, 
mainly because of his easy- 
on-the-ears voice and his 
outstanding lyrics. "Rock 
Me On the Water" and "Un- 
der the Falling Sky" are 
both up-tempo songs, and 
are good. 

Even though Jackson has 
established himself as a 



In MJBinr 

'Nicholas' memorable 
in many ways 

by Liz Schevtchuk 



performer besides being a 
songwriter, he Is still writ- 
ing songs for other people. 
He wrote the Eagles recent 
hit; "Take It Easy", which 
was another song almost 
too good to degrade by play- 
ing It o n t h e radio. Score 
another one for the bright 
disc jockeys, who constant- 
ly gave Browne credit for 
performing "Take It Easy" 
with his new band, the Ea- 
gles. The Eagles are not 
Jackson Browne's band, 
even though their lead sing- 
er does sound amazingly 
like Jackson. 

Browne Is one of those 
rare, talented few who be- 
lieve an album should be 
more than extended ver- 
sions of hit singles and self- 
indulgent filler material. 
Each cut deserves attention 
and could stand apart from 
the others, 

"Something Fine" Is typ- 
ical of the album; a slow 
tune featuring Jackson and 
his guitar, it sets a stand- 
ard of excellence for other 
songs of its type. 

Besides the excellent ma- 
terial (all written by 
Browne) the other notable 
thing about the album is 
Jackson's voice. It can 
sometimes sound like Steve 
Stills or Van Morrison but 
most of the time it just 
sounds like Jackson 
Browne... what could be bet- 
ter than that? 

This debut album has got 
to become a classic like 
Sgt. Pepper or Afterthe 
Gold Rush. Five years from 
now, Jackson Browne will 
still be making you happy. 



Academy Award winning 
movie, "Nicholas and 
Alexandra," memorable In 
many ways, leaves its 
strongest impression upon 
the viewer in regard to Its 
characterization. Although 
a historical film dealing 
with the most cataclysmic 
political event of the 20th 
century (the Russian Re- 
volution), "Nicholas and 
Alexandra' concentrates 
less on the historical as- 
pects of the event and more 
on its personal effects upon 
the lives of those It touched. 
The result is a detailed 
character study of the 
victim's. Instigators, and 
bystanders caught up in the 
throes' of the revolution. 

There are, of course, the 
Czar Nicholas and his 
beautiful but often sorrow- 
■ful wife, Alexandra. Pro- 
ducts of their times and 
backgrounds, neither Is 
able to escape the con- 
sequences Induced by their 
upbringing. 

Proud, obstinate, steeped 
In the authoritarian style 
of government so often 
favored by monarchists, 
Nicholas is in many cases 
unable to understand the 
forces of change under- 
mining his rule and all of 
his world. 

Refuses counsel 

Stubbornly Insisting that 
he alone knows what Is 
right for his people, he re- 
fuses to heed the counsel 
of his more capable ad- 
visors. Yet he often feels 
powerless, torn between 
his love for his wife and 
his fears of her growing 
domination over him. 

Because he is blind to the 
realities of his era, his 
ultimate awakening comes 
too late and he can save 
neither himself and his 
family nor the old Russia 
to which he clung, 

Alexandra, while display- 
ing some of the decisive- 
ness lacking in her hus- 
band. Is nonetheless weak 
herself. Unable to find a 
place for herself In the 
glittering pageantry of 
Russian aristocracy, she Is 
frightened and lonely. 

Haunted by the knowledge 
that her German heritage 
makes her an outsider at 
the " Russian court, she 
trusts no one but the 
mystical monk, Rasputin, 
who seems to hold in his 
hands the powers of life 
and death over her 
hemophiliac son. Her son's 
affliction obsesses her to 
the point that she adopts 
a secluded existence, re- 
treating from all outsiders, 
including, at times, her 
husband. 

The sensitive treatment 
accorded these two tragic 
personalities lends much to 



the beauty of the film. In- 
cluded in all of the un- 
fortunate circumstances 
confronting the royal 
family, the viewer forgets 
that these people were 
sovereigns of one of the 
most powerful nations In 
Europe. Rather, they ap- 
pear as two hopelessly 
misguided individuals, both 
innocent and guilty In their 
ignorance, wanting only to 
live their lives in their 
designated positions with- 
out hindrance from outside 
forces. 

Contrast roles 

Serving as comple- 
mentary images to the 
central figures, the lesser 
characters provide direct 
contrasts to the major 
roles. Lenin embodies all 
of the spirit and shrewd 
leadership found wanting In 
the Czar's person. 

Rasputin, while presented 
in all of his vigorous 
coarseness, reveals a gen- 
tle nature and compassion 
unmatched his aristocratic 
opponents. The young Czar, 
heir to the throne, demon- 
strates the same attributes 
responsible for his fathers' 
difficulties. He therefore 
exemplifies the recurrence 
of dynastic errors among 
a succeeding generation. 

Other characters, as well, 
note the discrepancies in 
Russian society, the futility 
of war, and the unchecked 
momentum of a revolution 
tearing through the land. 
In simple words, the 
splendor of the characteri- 
zation produces an epic 
drama well worth the 
lesson in Russian history 
it Incidentally provides.

College stabs and pro notions 

It's prediction time again, football fanatics! Grab your 
bic and get on the stick. Your baseball picks were, as 
usual, nothing but a big mess. So I feel your college and 
pro-football prognostications should iielp you redeem 
(iieli, hehl) yourselves. At least I'll get a good laugh. 

So come hither to the Communicator office (Room 
109 off the Student Lounge) with your premonitions and 
do it by next Tuesday (1:00), or your venturing voice 
will not be heard. The voice of the female must be' 
heard, tool

We go to Carl WIegman, sports writer for the Journal-

dictions follow: 

NFC EAST: Dallas, Washington, St. Louis, Phila- 
delphia. N.Y. Giants. 

NFC CENTRAL: Minnesota, Detroit, Chicago, Green 
Bay, 

NFC WEST: San Francisco, L.A., Atlanta, New Orleans, 
AFC; east; Miami, Baltimore, N.Y. Jets, New Eng- 
land, Buffalo. 

AFC CENTRAL: Cincinnati, Cleveland, Houston, Pitts- 
burgh. 

AFC WEST: Kansas City, Oakland, San Diego, Denver, 

Wlegman's NFL East and West look okay, but my choice 
Is Detroit over Minnesota In the NFC Central Division. 
My AFC East shapes up like this: Miami, N.Y. Jets, 
Baltimore, Buffalo, New England. 

Wlegman's AFC West forcast seems probable, but 
he had to be kidding when he put Pittsburgh last In the 
AFC Central Division. The Steelers have put together 
their best team In years and are a cinch, in my opin- 
ion, to finish first, not last. 

As far as the 1973 Super Bowl Is concerned, I would 
not be at all surprised to see Dallas and Miami again 
meeting in the big one next January.

ABA-NBA merger at last 

A week ago a Senate subcommittee approved legis- 
lation that would at last allow the merger of the Na- 
tional Basketball Association with the American Basket- 
ball Association. This would finally end the price war 
between the two leagues which has seen: 1) clubs from 
both leagues pay astronomical sums to their own stars 
to keep them from "jumping." 2) clubs from both 
leagues pay stars from the rival league astronomical 
sums to "jump" to their team. 3) clubs from both 
leagues lure college stars away from their campusto play 
pro ball for outrageous sums of money. 

A key amendment in the bill allows for the elimination 
of the controversial reserve clause In pro basketball. 
This amendment would permit drafted players to be 
signed for two years only, after whlcti the players would 
be free agents able to negotiate their future with any 
team they desire. 

So, on second thought, this bill. If passed, might delay 
th e price war for two years. Then it will be war be- 
tween teams of a single league Instead of two leagues. 
Wow, what an Improvement, 



The I-PU tennisteam 
showed much promise In 
their first outing ever at the 
Taylor University Invita- 
tional Doubles Tournament 
last Saturday, September 9. 

The tournament was a 
round-robin between the 
top three doubles teams of 
Taylor, Goshen, Mar- 
lon, and I-PU. 

The Mastodon's number 
one doubles team of Galen
