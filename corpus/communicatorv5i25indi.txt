Film processing, posters 
available on campus 



By TOMMY FRANKE 

Students, are you aware that 
there is a place on campus where you 
can get film developed, slides made, 
and posters drawn? 

And do you know 

easles, television 
tape recorders? 

These things, as well as many 
other services and pieces of equip- 
ment, are available to any student, 
faculty or staff member through the 
Learning Resource Center, located in 
the basement of the Library. 

The only prerequisites for taking 



advantage 






that the work be for a university 
project and that the center is notified 
soon enough to give them enough time 
to make the necessary arrangements. 
Dr. Kenneth J. Balthaser, direct- 
or of the center, noted, "We can 
usually work on pretty short notice. 
However, it sure does help us when we 
have enough notice to be able to meet 
the needs that have been expressed to 

He added that students have 
"complete and free access to any 
equipment we have." Some of the 
equipment that is available at the 
center includes: bulletin, chalk, 
felt-flannel and magnetic boards, 
projection carts, filmstrip, motion 



picture and 
phonographs and stereos, screens, 
public address systems, slide project- 
ors, tape recorders, and television 



requested equipment. 

Balthaser added, "Most students 
now can work almost any piece of 
equipment just after looking at the 
equipment. There is a far cry from 
the past when the equipment was 
more complicated." 

The center will also work on 
projects for university use. For 
example, if a student or faculty 







that he w 









m, 



a large class, 
he can take the book to the center and 
slides will be made for him. 

Other projects that the center 
does are: dry mounting, film develop- 
ing, photography, and lettering for 
flyers, posters and original slides. 

Students are limited to five units 
of one project at a time, such as five 
slides or five posters. 

The staff at the Learning Re- 
source Center consists of Balthaser, 
Larry Wahti, assistant director, and 
Robert Novi, two full-time reception- 
ists and 21 part-time student assist- 
ants. Balthaser has a doctorate and 
Wahli has a masters, both with 
majors in structural systems techno- 
logy. Novi has a baccalaureate in 
radio and television. 

Balthaser said, "The students are 
the ones that do the actual set-ups and 
have the primary contacts with 



month for faculty use alone. 

He mentioned that most of the 
students who come to work at the 
center have little or no experience in 
audio-visual areas, but simply need a 
job. 

There are two other locations on 
campus that the Learning Resource 
Center is in charge of. One, in Room 
204 of Kettler Hall, is an independent 



1 floor of Kettler, is 
also a part of the Learning Resource 
Center. Both locations are staffed by 
students working part-time for the 



The center sends out a list of films 
that are expected on campus the next 
week to all faculty and staff 
members. Any person who wants to 
view one of these films, or who wants 
to order a specific film, can contact

Mann featured 
in faculty recital 

Adrian Mann, lecturer in music at 
Indiana-Purdue University and prin- 
cipal bass with the Fort Wayne 
Philharmonic Orchestra, will be 
featured artist at a faculty recital at 
8:00 p.m. Saturday. February 16, in 
the auditorium of Ncff Hall. The event

Master of Music at the Catholic 
University of America, where he is 
presently a candidate for the Doctor 
of Musical Arts degree in Double 
Bass, a program which he helped 

Mann's prim 



ed the Colorado Philharmonic, the 
Orchestra International Inventus in 
Salerno, Italy, and the Goldovsky 

engagements have been with the 
Richmond Symphony Orchestra and

Tempest Storm, a stripper, will 
speak on the burlesque art at Indiana- 
Purdue Thursday, at 2:00 p.m. and 
8:00 p.m. in the ballroom of the 
Student Union. 

According to Jim Bolinger, stu- 
dent activities director, Miss Storm 
might give the audience "a little 
surprise performance." 

This presentation is being spon- 
sored by the Convocations Commit- 
tee. Her performance is free to 
activity card holders and $1.25 to the 
general public. Tickets may be picked 
up at Ye Olde Sweet Shoppe.

Alderman "I want lo motivate young 
people and poor people to have a hand 
in this government." 

He said that he knows what young 
people want, citing his four years of 
attendance at IU-PU as experience. 
He also said that his background 
enables him to understand the 
problems of poor people. 

"I want to motivate these people 
to go out and work for change," 
Alderman said, referring especially 
to IU-PU students. He said that he 
wants to represent change. 

Alderman criticized Republican 
Sheriff hopeful Charles Meeks' drug 
proposals. "Drug addiction is a social 
problem as well ,c. .&lt; law i.-iiloreement

should be a continual crackdown on

licked only when the cause of 
addiction is discovered and cured. 

"Social agencies are going to

find out what motivates potential 
users to become addicted and cure the 
problem there," Alderman said. 

Alderman thinks that the propos- 
ed regional corrections center is "one 
of the best ideas yet " He said that Hie 
center should stress rehabilitation 
rather than correction.

He said that vehicle n 
alone would provide a great savings 
to taxpayers. Presently the city 
operates a police garage to repair and 
maintain city police vehicles while 
the Sheriff must contract out the 
county's vehicle work. 

He also plans to emphasize 
minority employment in the Sheriff's 
Department should he be elected. He 
said that presently there are no 
minority members of the department. 

Alderman has been a student at 
Indiana-Purdue on and off for the last 
four years. In addition, he attended 
the Indiana Law Enforcement Acad- 
emy at Indiana University, where he 
was awarded an academic achieve- 
ment award by State Attorney 
General Theodore Sendak for gradu- 
ating Number One in his class. 

Alderman has also attended the 
Indiana State Police school on 
organized crime and the Provost 
Martial General's training school. He 
served for three years as a military 
policeman in the Far East. 

He has been with the Sheriff's 
Department for six years, serving 
first in the jail as both a guard and 
desk sergeant. He is presently in the 
detective bureau serving as a warrant 
officer.

Faculty mistrust 



The recent independence vote bv the Purdue faculty was very 
significant, but not at face value. The vote was 59-50 against 
independence, but the true significance lies not in the fact that 
independence was voted down. 

First of all, the vote was very close. A change in only five votes would 
have produced an endorsement for complete independence. When one 
removes the six administrators who were constitutionally eligible to vote 
- presumably all voted and against independence - the difference is a 
mere three votes. 

The fact that the vote was so close after the announcement of the 
super-chancellor agreement is also significant. Those 50 pro-indepen- 
dence votes do not say much for the integrity of the universities' 
administrations. This would indicate that Dearly half of the Purdue 
facultv have no confidence in the words of their own president. 

a" third factor is that this vote comes on the eve of academic 
autonomy for Purdue departments. Many professors apparently do not 
view even an autonomous relationship with their Lafayette colleagues as 
entirely beneficial for tU-PU programs. 

The vote did show that the faculty are still seriously divided over 
what the future should hold for this campus. The advent of the 
super-chance Mm- apparently has done little to subside this divisiveness. 

The vole lends credibility to perception that the super-chancellor is 
already chosen and that the search and screen committee is wasting its 
time to provide a front of legitimacy for the pre-chosen candidate. 

There still exists great mistrust for the central administrations. 
Presidents Ryan and Hansen had better give priority to removing this 
mistrust, or, by their failure to do anything, they will indict themselves of 
the worst of these suspicions.

Editor's Note: This is the second 
of two stories arguing for and against 
the death penalty. 

By DENNIS MCCARTHY 

LOS ANGELES (CNS) - "When I 
was 12 years old and living in another 
part of the country, I bought a mail 
order rifle with the express intent of 
killing my stepfather. 

"I remember being tremendously 
enraged at him because of the way he 
would constantly taunt me and I knew 
thai someday 1 would sit in the loft of 
the barn and shoot him dead as he 
walked back to the house." 

This statement could have come 
from thousands of homicidal persons 
in state penitentiaries throughout the 
country or possibly from the hundreds 
of thousands of potential homicidals 
in our society. 

But it did not. 

It is a statement made by the 
former medical director of the Los 
Angeles County Probation Depart- 
ment and now staff psychiatrist at 
Glendale Adventist Hospital, Dr. 
Henry Haye. 

What stopped the doctor from 
pulling the trigger in 1942, he says, 
was the thought of dying -- of giving 
his life in order to take that of his 
stepfather's. 

"In my opinion there's no doubt 
that capital punishment is a deter- 
rent. It certainly was for me," he 



behavior in stepping outside the limits 
and trying to emulate lawbreakers. 

"If the only deterrent is a lenient 
court and the possibility of a stretch in 
prison then the chances for this 
become even greater," he said. 

"But in dealing with the death 
penalty you have the situation where 
the potential homicide can recognize 
the definitiveness and absoluteness of 
it and begin to respond accordingly. 

"Likewise, anything that is indef- 
inite is hard to develop a set of 
reactions to," he said. 

Such indefiniteness can be found 
in the courts, Dr. Haye said. "If a 
person commits a crime, they should 



"After the trial then the extenuat- 
ing circumstances come into play and 
the person can be helped, but first the 
court must take the hard line," he 

Dr. Haye says he believes a 
harder line and less chance of parole 
for a convicted homicide would also 
act as a deterrent. 

"But, in the end, the most final 
sort of statement that can be made by 
society is death," he said.

Tax break for clothes

Is a woman's office dress

Revenue Service, every answer but 
the last is correct. 

Granted that women have a 
reasonable desire to be noticed by

counter to the facts. Nurses and 
' beauticians wear anything but shape- 
less sacks, yet IRS doesn't disallow 
deductions for uniforms when they 
enhance the wearer's beauty. Goth- 
ing for the office is a uniform of 
another sort. 

Businesses may deny it, but every

- 1 am very happy you asked that 
question. We are in need of a clearer 
policy concerning committees Many 
a faculty forget.-, which committees he 
serves as a chairman, vice-chairman 
or member, which creates confusion 
due to small rostrums. Also, it often 
has happened in the past that the 
same professor was scheduled to 
appear at several committees at the 
same time, but this will be avoided 
thanks to our brand new $1,(mhi.ooo,ikh&gt;

the research area we are still lagging, 
but I have suggested that our young 
faculty who are not yet fully 
participating in active academic life, 
prepare a study in depth of the 
university's releases and minutes, to 
make sure that the staff knows winch 
decision it has implemented over the 
last five decades. A multi-volume 
dictionary of committees and its 
members would be also helpful. In 
addition, in this period of shortages of 
all kinds, we could introduce a new

behind the file cabinets. 

For a woman in the c 
tions field, the pressure is even 
fiercer. She has to project the sweet 
smell of success while she's still 
struggling on a woman's meager 



salary. When a boss says (as mine 
often did) "look especially pretty 
tomorrow, important people are 
coming," that means "wear some- 
thing that looks chic and expensive." 
While women are disallowed 
deductions for dressing for the job, 
they work in offices where every cent 
of die plush carpeting, Scandinavian 
modern furniture and original works 
of art are tax deductible. So is the 
interior decorator's fee. Now any 
office can function with sensible 
metal desks, used filing cabinets and 
some nice bank calendars to enhance 
the pleasant institutional green of the 
walls. However, goes the argument 
which IRS has bought, who would 
want to do business with a firm that 
couldn't maintain an expensive fac- 



Don't try deducting your Gucci 
shoes or Vuitton bag even if you work 
in the fashion industry. But your boss 
can deduct the difference between a 
Ford and a Cadillac if a status symbol 
is deemed necessary to maintain his 
image as the successful businessman. 
And, of course, the chauffeur's salary 
from 9 to 5 is also a business expense. 
What would a potential client think of 
someone who had to drive his own 

You can't deduct the cost of the 
outfit you bought to go job-hunting in, 
but Mr. fatcat businessman charges 
off to Uncle Sam the bill for his new 
yacht (plus the cost of crew) if he 
invites prospective customers 
aboard. And IRS doesn't even ask if 
the models, starlets, bunnies and 
assorted playmates also invited to 



pla 



make the trip business 



But the wardrobe you scrimped 
and saved for so you would look like 
the girl in the Glamor "Dream Job" 
feature, that is clearly for your own 
personal pleasure as far as IRS is 
concerned. It would seem only 
elementary fairness to be allowed to 
deduct a part of its cost, some portion 
of its depreciation, or at the very least 
the dry-cleaning bills for maintaining 
it. But not a cent is allowed. 

The reason for this inequity is ' 
hardly obscure. Men hold more power 
than women and rich men more 
power than other men. As has been 
noted many times, our tax laws are 
written mainly to the advantage of 
rich men. Why should these men 
press for the recognition of clothing as 
the status symbol it is, when there is 
much higher ante for them and when, 
moreover, such a deduction would 
benefit every little secretary. Some- 
body's got to pay taxes. 

As for the man at the bottom of 
the ladder, in the days of women's 
greatest oppression, when dictatorial 
chic made each season's fashion 
instantly obsolescent, the male's 
business attire was the perennial gray 
flannel suit. 

Now that men's fashions are 
becoming as highly styled as wo- 
men's, looking like a fashionplate will 
eventually become the financial 
burden to men that it has been to 
women. Then we may see a 
recognition in our tax laws that the 
maintenance of status is not a 
business expense limited to the rich. 



FOOTNOTES: A CONGRESSIONAL REPORT 



Foreign aid questioned 



Although a longer and more 
detailed report will be available to 
you. I would like to submit this very 
brief report on my trip to Central and 
South America. The trip was taken 
during the congressional recess and 
covered fifteen days. It was an official 
working trip made as a member of the 
Foreign Operations Subcommittee of 
the Appropriations Committee. The 
Subcommittee handles the Foreign 
Assistance Appropriations Bill which 
this past year totaled $5.8 billion. As a 
critic of that program I have the 
responsibility of seeking all of the 
knowledge and understanding I can 
possibly acquire on the cost of each of 
the many programs, whether or not 
the programs are effective, and above 
all whether or not the best interests of 
the United States are being served. 

To get some feel for all of this 1 
visited two countries in Central 
America and two countries in South 
America. My instructions to those 
planning the trip were simple. "I 
want no cocktail parties, no recep- 
tions, and no formal office briefings. I 



a the people in charge and I v 
talk to those who are supposedly the 
beneficiaries of the programs." 

My instructions were followed. I 
did get out into the countryside and I 
did see where the money was actually 



farmers, teachers, doctors, engi- 
neers, government officials and 
peasants. I saw public works projects, 
schools, hospitals, clinics, farms, 
universities, fisheries and reclama- 
tion projects. I saw places where our 
money had been the stimulus for the 
local economy for years. I saw areas 
where we are just beginning to 
influence the economy, .1 saw grate- 
ful people and I saw those who were 
complaining because we were not 
doing more. I saw an expression of 
American compassion in Managua 
where a little more than a year ago a 
terrible earthquake destroyed a large 
city killing over ten thousand people 
and leaving fifty thousand families 
homeless. I also saw us doing things 
for others which we seem so reluctant 
to do for our own people. . .such as the 
building of schools, hospitals and 
roads. ..such as providing housing, 



that there is indescribable need in the 
world. I also came home knowing that 
we must establish priorities and as 
much as our help is needed we must 
ask ourselves whether or not the best 
interests of our own country are being 
served by what we do in those far 
places. 1 am going to have many 
questions to ask of those responsible 
for these foreign aid programs when 
they appear before my subcommittee 
this coming year for in so many 



being spent. I 



1 businessmen, 



interests of the United States were not 
being served by our foreign aid 
programs. 



Quotes to 
remember

America as a Government of the 
people, by the people, for the people; 
whose just powers are derived from 
the consent of the governed; a 
democracy in a republic, a sovereign 
Nation of many sovereign States; a 
perfect Union one and inseparable; 
established upon those principles of 
freedom, equality, justice and - 
humanity for which American 
patriots sacrificed their lives and 
•fortunes. I therefore believe it is my 
July to my country to love it, to 
support its Constitution, to obey i 
laws, to respect its flag, and to defend 
it against all enemies.

SUPER JOCK BROCK 

Brock Able is presently in his second 

stint as student body president of 
Indiana-Purdue. He is of the easy-going 
type and can usually be found in his niche in 
the student government complex discuss- 
ing uh. . . .relevant topics with student 
officials and friends. 

Through the misfortune of an auto 
accident, Brock is confined to a wheelchair. 
But that's hardly enough to keep him 
isolated from the sports scene. 

He coached one of the past year's best 
intramural football squads ;*nd is now 
beginning his fourth campaign as coach of 
the intramural basketball Super Jocks. His 
cage coaching record presently stands at 
31-7 for three years plus, and most of those 
losing efforts were close - overtime close. 

His best year? "The team's best year 
had to be in 1972 when we went 9-1 and 
placed second in the post-season tourna- 

That year the Posse was the only squad 
able to handle Brock's charges. In the 
tourney a 71-70 setback followed an 
overtime loss (both to the now-departed 
Posse) with handed the Super Jocks a 
second-place finish. 

This year each of 30 squads are 
scheduled to play only five games during 
the eight-week intramural span. How does 

"In 1972 there were 22 teams which 
played 10 regular season games each. And 
last year there were 24 teams playing 11 
games each before the tourney." 

"This year there are 180 guys playing 
five games all year. Five games is 
ridiculous. For one thing, it's going to lead 
to a lot of forefeits because if a team loses 
two games, they know they're out of the 



"Why not have two gyms for more 
games? The interest is there." 

He suggests a three division-ten team 
set-up where each entry plays all others in 
the division for a total of nine contests. 
Brock claims that with the short schedule 
and total point spreads possibly affecting 
playoff berths, "Some teams might have to 
humiliate other teams to get into the 
tourney for more action if nothing else. And 
it's supposed to be a league where guys go 



important things that must be done well to 
be a success in intramural basketball in 
controlling the running clock. "I think I 
know how to use that clock." 

He says that valuable time can t» 
eaten up at such points as the free throw 
line or crossing the ten-second time line. 
"And most teams have trouble controlling 
the game by the clock." 

A bit of game philosophy: "I love 
defense. If you can stop them before they 
shoot, you can better control the clock and 
the game." 

And how does Brock feel toward the 
referees? "I rarely give any flak to the 
refs. And if I do, I always preface it with 
'sir.' Intramural refs let things go unless 
someone complains." 

In 1972 technical fouls on the Super 
Jocks played a key role in sending them 
down to defeat in one tilt against the Posse. 
So now Brock attaches a severe penalty to 
anyone, including himself of course, who 
draws a technical for something like saying 



raising his a 

that, I won't penalize him." But almost 

anything else will invoke the penalty: a 

pitcher of beer for each member of the 

squad. 

And that brings up a story which took 
place in 1972. ' 'We played Dr. Ed Leonard's 
team and a keg of beer had been bet on the 
game. 'The Great Water Buffalo' had a guy 
playing for him named Jim Whitt. We 
couldn 't stop Whitt but we beat the team by 

"That Leonard has never paid up." 
You should have seen Brock sizzle after 
that one. 

Able says this year will probably be his 
last at Indiana-Purdue. "I hope to be 
accepted at Illinois and get a physical

This writer wishes all the luck in the 
world to Brock Able. Here's hoping he will

hard to achieve that goal of which he
