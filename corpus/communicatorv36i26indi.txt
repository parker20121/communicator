Hundreds protest 




■ Protestors gathered in both support 
ahdvppostion in downtown Fort 
Wayne for HR4437lasr Saturday 



By Andrew C. Hoover 



As record -set ting protests 
rocked Los Angeles and other 
majorllnited Stales cities, even 
Fort Wayne was the setting of 



gathered and took to the 
with signs that read "Stor. 
Xenophobia," "Immigran 
Rights' 



Immigrants." 

Even with the rumor that 
skinhead and other violent 
groups would arrive to break up 
the protests, the crowd surged 
on waving American (lags and 
tarrying their children. 

Very few pro-HR4437 
people were on scene to 
protest the protestors, and 



the few times they did meet it 
was non-violent, although the 
jeers were often cruel and very 
vulgar. 

I lowever. the lack of support 
for HR4437 does not reflect the 
general feel of Americans. 

A recent NBC poll showed 
an overwhelming 59 percent 
oF people were opposed to 
illegal immigrants applying lor 
temporary-worker status. 

A Quinnipiac University 
poll showed a staggering 62 
percent of people surveyed 
were opposed to making 
citizenship easier and that 57 
percent consider it a serious 
poll. Time Magazine Poll 
showed that 75 percent say that 
the U.S. is doing a "bad job" 
and "not enough" in regards to 
illegal in i migration.

Liz Murray's life is a triumph over adversity and a 
stunning example of the importance of dreaming big. 
Her life as the child of cocaine-addicted parents in the 
Bronx was grim. By the time Murray was 15, her mom had 
died, and she was homeless— living on the streets, riding 
the subway all night, and eating from dumpsters. Murray 
imagined her life could be much better. She finished high 
school in just two years and began college at Harvard, 
thanks to a scholarship from The New \brk Times. 

Murray's story sounds like a Hollywood movie— and it 
practically is. Lifetime Television produced a movie 
about Murray's life, From Homeless to Harvard, 
which premiered in April 2003. She was a recent recipient 
of Oprah Winfrey's first Chutzpah Award.

For the most pan. all of us are 
thinking about our personal health on 
a daily basis. 

We wonder how we compare to 
others, how long me might live and if 
we are doing things that are detrimental 
to our life span. Well, the odds are 
that most 1 of us are harming others 
and ourselves without even knowing it.

Anyway, the first thing all of us need 
to do is to turn off electronics and such 
when we are not using them. I know 
most of us have a problem with leaving 
lights on, but I learned the true impact 
of this once 1 started paying my own 
electric bill. Every light, television or 
stereo that is left on, lhat is energy being 
used, as well as your dollar bills. 

If you are leaving a room, turn stuff 
off. If it is sunny outside, open some 
blinds and let the sunlight in. This not 
only allows you to keep the lights off, but

Horses need Triple Crown 



Staff Column 



I love more then anything is watching 
competition involving horses, especially 
Thoroughbred racing. As a racing fan, 
I think we are in dire need of a Triple 
Crown winner. Ah, the Triple Crown. 
Three races - the Kentucky Derby, 

honor was back in 1977 with Citation. 
Eleven horses won this title. Eleven. 
That is not very many. There have been 
many horses that have tried but failed 



A horse that v

it was stolen right out from under his 

1 remember watching the race- 
thinking he's going to do it, he's going 
to do it. But, he doesn't do it. Another 
horse beats him at the end. How 
disappointing is that? I would say 
highly disappointing. 1 think how the 
horses are trained has a huge effect on 
how they run. The Thoroughbreds are 
trained a lot differendy than back in the 
20th century. The horses in the 1900s 

For example, Man 0' War raced 21 
times in the two years that he raced. 
Seabiscult and Secretariat raced even 
more then 21 times. I think trainers are 
concentrating too much on training the 
horses and get them fit and conditioned 
instead of racing. 

Training can only do so much for a 
horse until it doesn't help it anymore. 



I think the jockey took Funny Cide 
out too hard too fast. The horse was 
burned out by the end. There was so 
much hope that this horse was the horse 
that would finally win the Triple Crown 
after so many years. It was such a 
disappointment. 

Then there was Smarty Jones. This 
horse was brilliant. He looked so much 
like Secretariat, hence why he was 
referred to as Red. The horse looked 
so much like Secretariat (Big Red) that 



e seen and what I know. And 
&gt;w is that we need a horse to 
the Triple Crown after almost 



30 years. 

And the horse to do it needs to b 
strong, quick and mentally ready t 
handle a grueling three race battle t

Concert Review 






When people say a 
problem they really mean it. 

Mushroomhead is a band of 
amazingly clean-cut men whose 
members range in age from 23 
to 35. Hard to believe, when 
watching them on stage, that 



Helligent,, hardcore 



group has accomplished in the 
last 13 years, most of which has 
been spent independent of any 
record label. 

Skinny, the band's drummer, 
founded the band in 1993 
as an underground group 
located in Cleveland, Ohio. 
Mushroomhead had a huge 
following from the beginning. 



playing for 2000 people their 

They released their first 
independent album in 1995, 
called "Mushroomhead" 
followed by "Superbuick" in 
1996. "Remix" in 1997 and "M3" 
in 1999. Mushroomhead has 
also had their music featured on 

mime soundtracks like "I reddy that addre-ses 
vs. lason". "The Scorpion King", lot of emotion 
"XXX" and the newest "Texas 
( bainsaw Massacre". 

Their stage appearance, 
as seen last Wednesday 



in earlier years, they have 
opened for such bands as 
Marilyn Manson and Type O 
Negative, but it wasn't long 
before Mushroomhead became

Commentary 






Oil, money and undercover operaiions are the 
necessary components of a drama full of intrigue. 
"Syrians" is one such thought provoking movie 
that gives the viewer a peak into a new world. 
Not only does tin 1 .mine, convince the viewer 
of the severity of the topic at hand, but the plot 
does as well. 

The intertwining of behind the scenes politics 
in the United States with the oil industry gives 
the viewer one example of the way business is 
done by those in power to achieve the success 
they desire. It is just as Danny Dalton (Tim Blake 
Nelson) argued in the movie, "Corruption is our 
protection. It's what keeps us safe and warm." 

While the first 30 minutes is slow moving and 
seems to jump from country to country with little 
going on. the rest of the movie is comprised of 
more action. This highly complex plot including 
Bob Barnes (George Clooney}, a hire for hit man, 
as well as Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), a 
financial analyst, leaves the viewer wondering 
how much of the story takes place in real life 
situations. Many are prone to believe it is close 
to reality. 

Included in the intricate plot is Bennett Holiday 
(Jeffrey Wright), who is hired to investigate a 
merger of Connex oil and Kilen oil in order to 
determine any foul play. Also included in the 
twists of the movie is a Saudi royal family and 
their part in the oil industry, as well as one 
Pakistani's plight for meaning and survival. The 
camera view into different parts of the world 
creates a glimpse into how non-U.S. citizens view 
the U.S. 

You are always at the edge of grasping what is 
going on but not quite taking a tight hold until 
you leave the theater and discuss it with your 
fellow moviegoers. 

While the flavor of the movie may not be to 
someone's liking who enjoys the full throttle, 
action packed, blow 'em up movies, this movie 
embodies the workings of a strongly motivated 
politically minded director. 

At times, the back and forth motion of the 
plot leaves the viewer with too much confusion 
and the mini story of Bennett Holiday and his 
father adds to it. You get to the end of the movie 




wondering il vuu missed [lie purpose ot (his 
addition to the film. This is also Hue for Hubs

there seems to be u small highlight on every

Something thai was hindering

he heard about Coven when 
she lefl a voice mail on his 
phone in the track office asking 
if he needed any help with Ihe 
program. He added that he 
was getting to the point where 
he was looking for a coach 
last year. He had a few people 
in mind of who he wanted to 
ask. Everything worked out. 
and Covert became a pan time 

' Fruchey said that Coven 
is the most effective sprint/ 
hurdle/jump coach the team 
has had so far. He added 
that she was a good asset to 
che team because she knows 
everything well in regards to 
the springs, hurdles and jumps. 
At the age of 27, Fruchey said 
Covert relates to the kids better 
because she's younger. 

One thing Covert brings 
to the program, according to 
Fruchey, is the fact that she 
qualified for the championships 
herself. She also doesn't ask the 
athletes Co do anything that she 
hasn't done herself. Fruchey 
said that she jumps in on a 
work ouc occasionally to help 
her athleces push themselves 
harder. 

Coven hopes this season 
that her group runs faster and 
jumps further than they've ever 
done before. She wants them 
to gain experience competing 
at the collegiate level since 
her group consists of all new 

"My group of girls are great," 

She also added that she was 
proud of them. Her goal thai 
she had for them this year was 
Co break the old school records.

s for indoor and outdoor. 
And Coven's favorite part about 
coaching is the kids. She really 
likes working with people and 
helping them. Covert feels that 
her athletes can go to her with 
problems they may be having 
even outside of " 

Covert likes 
track because i 
and the alhlete has Co be serious 
about running. 

"I wouldn't mind coaching 



everything. The college level 
is at a higher and different 
level Chan high school Crack, 
according to Coven. She feels 
fortunate because she's done a 
good job. 

At 27 years old, Coven feels 
that she has an advantage for 
being young. She's fresh out 
of competing. She can relate 
to how the athletes are feeling.
