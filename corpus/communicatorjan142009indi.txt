^ Scale 

From Page 1 



Really, ihey don't. 
The administralion 

seems to be just as lost as 
the students. There were 
classes that kept the typi- 
cal straight letter scale 
last semester. There 
were also classes who 
used the new system. 
Looking through syllabi, 
it appears to be up to the 
professor or instructor 
to choose what he or she 
thinks is best, not what 
the undergraduate bul- 
letin says. 

"The optional change 
made me wonder what 
the administration is 
thinking. It didn't nega- 
tively or positively influ- 
ence my grades, but the 
issue definitely got me 
thinking." student Ra- 
chael Lydy said. 

"There are some who 
claim that with tougher 
grading scales students 
get lower letter grades, 
while others claim the 
grades normalize." Dean 
Flagel, Dean of Admis- 
sions for George Mason 
University', located in 
Fairfax, Virginia said. If 
the plus minus grading 
scale is seemingly tough* 
er than the original, then 



why would professors rules: take for example 

want grades to normal- the Electoral College 

ize? The entire purpose and who gets to pick the 

of grades is to showcase music in the car when 

those students who real- you're on a spring break 

ly understood the mate- road trip. It's all about 

rial and those who really what's popular. But is it 

did not, fair that the administra- 

It's shocking to hear tion switches the scale 

diat most colleges have for purely un-academic 



switched to the plu 
nus scale within the past 
few years because, truth- 
fully, everyone else is do- 
ing it. 

For example, Kent 
State University, located 
in Ohio, has a question 
and answer page about 

their new 

grading 
scale. When 
asked why 
the new 
system 

was imple- 

me n t ed . 

Kent Stale officials re- 
plied with, "KSU is 
among the minority of 
schools in Ohio that do 
not use a Plus/Minus 
system." 

Therefore, the admin- 
istration made the deci- 



reasons, as in the case of 
Kent State? 

"Thai's a ridiculous 
reason. To switch to 
something that is regard- 
ed as the 'popular op- 
tion' is insane." student 
Brad Koenemann said. 
Next is the question 



"The optional change 
made me wonder what tiie 
administration is blinking." 



of academic freedom. 
Should professors he 
able to be individually 
responsible for grades 
and set their oivn scales? 
Academic freedom has 
long been touted as nec- 
essary and objective; but 
sion to change the scale has it become the op- 
because the majority posite without us even 
had. The majority always knowing?

Many Indiana uni- 
versities have already 
switched to a plus minus 
scale. Is IPFW one of the 
last to essentially give in 
and go with the crowd? 
Buder University uses 
the plus minus scale. As 
does Notre Dame, Ball 
State and Indiana State 
University, just to name a 
few.There are many more 
and research has shown 
that the colleges with the 
plus minus system out- 
number ones with the 
tradidonalA-F system. 

"About every school 
district, state or private 
school has a different 
grading scale. This can 
sometimes present a 
problem because what 
can be an "A" at one 
school might be a "B+" 
or even a "B" at anoth- 
er." reports the College 
of Charleston admis- 
sions blog. The big issue 
with the optional grading 
scale is blatant discrep- 
ancj'. An 'A' may be a 'B'

New year brings new faces, positions in IPFW Student Government 




student Body 
Presidential Address 



Both the year and 
the semester are new 
and that presents a 
perfect opportunity for 
a fresh start. Student 
Government uali be 
using this time to work 
even more at improving 
our image on campus 
and the impact we can 
make for the student 
body. 

Included in this fresh 
start is the introduction 



of Hagi Bradley as the new 
Student Government Co- 
ordinator. Hagi has moved 
from his position as Asso- 
ciate Director of Student 
Life to continue his ser- 
vice to the students from 
a slightly different angle. 
I encourage students both 
in and out of student gov- 
ernment to welcome him 
with open arms. Since it is 
the beginning of the new 
semester I would also like 



to remind the students of 
a few other things. First, 
there are still posirions 
available in both the Stu- 
dent Senate and the Stu- 
dent Activities Board. For 
more information on get- 
ting involved in either of 
these contact the IPSGA 
office or just drop by and 
we will be glad to help 
you out. 

Also there is still 
around $100,000 avail- 



able from Senate for 
travel money and event 
funding. Contact Erik 
Shepherd, the Vice 
President of Finance, if 
you want to know more 
about the money up for 
grabs. And IPSGA recent- 
ly spent nearly $20,000 
from our reserve account 
to beautify certain areas 
of the Gates Sports Cen- 
ter. I encourage you lo 
take a look al the updates 



and let us know what you 

think. 

Finally I would like to. 
thank Suzanne Chalmers 
for serving the last few 
months as our Interim 
Student Government Co- 
ordinator. She did an ex- 
cellent job filling in and 
keeping IPSGA running 
smoothly 



Despite Budget Cuts 

Chancellor Wartell optimistic about IPFW's future 



By Dan Jehl 

jehldjDieipfw.edu 



Michael A. Wanell 

has been an academic, 
a scientist, and now 
for decades, a fonvard- 
planning administrator. 
In 1994. 30 years after 
Indiana Universitj'- 

Purdue University -Fort 
Wayne had its first class 
of students, Wartell was 
appointed chancellor of 
IPFW. 

In September 

2008 Wanell delivered 
the IPFW annual fall 
convocation address 
before more than 300 
attendees at , Walb 
Memorial Union for the 
new 2008-09 academic 
year. Months later 
in December, The 
Communicator sat with 
the Chancellor for a 
convocation speech 
update. 

TheCommunlcator: 
Chancellor, at the 
convocation, you 

mentioned that IPFW 
enrollment passed the 
12,000 mark for the 
first time. What's the 
enrollment goal? 
ChanceUor Michael 



Warteil: The strategic 
plan calls for a future 
enrollment goal of 
15,000, and enrollment 
increases each year 
aided by new programs. 
TC: In your fall 
convocation address, 
you mentioned building 
projects. How are the 
projects proceeding? 
MW: On future resident 
housing, 448 new 
beds or units went to 
competitive bidding in 
December, and came 
in 53,000,000 under the 
estimate. Construction 
is next. The Holiday 
Inn is fully open and 
operational and has 
the Mastodon Grill and 
IPFW Board Room. 

The bridge is a 
weather dependent 
construction project, 
and it will be the 
walkivay to the Holiday 
Inn. During the winter 
semester, the moving 
vnl\ occur for the 
Medical School. We ivill 
then have all four years 
housed on campus with 
.degrees. And the big 
one coming up is the 
Student Services Center 
which will connect the 
Gates Center, Walb, 
and Helmke. The 



hid opening is set for

One was a Learning 
Commons. What is the 
status of this? 
MW: The Learning 

Commons will be an 
environment for learning 
among all students that 
will basically be the entire 
second floorof the Helmke 
Library. It's ongoing. This 
is a collaborative campus 



said: "IPFW is tiie best 
bang for the buck." Can 
this continue? 
MW: Yes, by continuing 
to hire first rate faculty, 
keeping classes at 
reasonable numbers 
and keep doing what 
we're doing. This will 
be a challenge with the

Are there any in the 
planning stages? 
MW: TVadidons, by 
definition, lake time. 



Lit tie by little we are 
developing those 

traditions but it takes 
time and we are a very 
young campus. All kinds 
of things are coming 
about. Yet it can't be done 
overnight. 

TC: How does IPFW 
funding look in your 
crystal ball with the 
upcoming Indiana 

Legislative Session? 
MW: The Indiana 
Legislature must adopt 
a biennial budget for 
2009-2011 by May. This 
year all state-funded 
universities received a 
one percent give-back 
or recession that already 
applies to this year 
[2008-09]. We will receive 
about $400,000 less 
state funding from the 
amount the Legislature 
approved, 

TC: "Does this affect 
tuition or mean a tuition 
surcharge for the winter 
semester? 

MW: No, this does not 
mean a tuition hike, it is 
not related to tuition. For 
the future, our legislative 
delegation will do the 
best they can, and we will 
have to tighten our belts.

Ah, New Years. The 
perfect lime to resolve 
to lose 40 pounds before 

February; hit the gym 



three hours per day; 
complete assignments 
on time; breed the first 
flying pig. 

Now that we've dis- 
pensed with the peren- 
nial fairy talcs, consider 
a resolution you can 
slick with. Sock some 
of that money away for 



the future. Even though 
at age 25 it's much easier 
to think about this week- 
end than it is to ponder 
retirement finances, con- 
sider this: if a 27 -year old 
plans for retirement at 
age 65, the current esti- 
mate for necessary funds 
is roughly S2.4 



advice from author E.L. 
DoctoroW that not only 
applies to writing, but to' 

finances as well: "Writing 
a novel is like driving a 
car at night. You can only 
see as far as your head- 
lights, but you can make 
the whole trip that way." 



to plan for the big pic- 
tiue. No, really, it's true. 
And the way to conquer 
the financial mountain 
that is retirement is to in- 
vest a little bit of money 
regulariy, and ivithout 
fail. There ate numerous 
ways to invest your cash 



wisely, and in small, di- 
gestible bites. 

For instance, my res- 
olution was to begin in- 
vesting again in an old 
Rodi IRA account that I 
had opened back in 2003. 
Even though I haven't 
contributed to it in about 
five years, the money I 
had put in it has been 
compounding and earn- 
ing interest even while 
I had forgotten about 
it. That's the beauty of 
Investing. Your money 
keeps working for you 
long after you've spent 
the principal. Consider 
resolving to take a small 
chunk of your salary and 
put it toward your ftiture.

Preparing for Chris Brown Prediction 5K 



By Kelly McLendon

Runner's World Mag- 
azine writer and 1968 
Boston Marathon win- 
ner Amby Burfoot says, 
"Don't rush. In the fitness 
world, rushing leads to 
injuries and discourage- 
ment. Be patienl, and go 
slow. The goal is to reach 
30 minutes of continuous 
running, not to set any 
records getting there." 

After you've estab- 
lished a steady routine 
running iwo or three 



days a week, start think- 
ing about doing a race. 
The easiest to start off 
with is a 5k, which works 
out to 3.1 miles. 

If you start training 
now, you could enter the 
February 8 race at Gates 
Center. It's the Chris 
Brown Prediction 5K. 
You predict how fast you 
think you can run the 3 
miles and those who ac- 
tually run closest to their 
predicted times ivin. 

Brown was an IPFW 
student and cross coun- 
try and track runner who 



lost his battle iviih can- 
cer on December 1, 2007.

Day of Service 

to kick off new chapter in history 



By Katy Anderson 

Andckn01@ipFw.edu 



To many, Martin Lu- 
ther King, Jr. day is spent 
taking the day off from 
work or school and more 
llian likely not spent giv- 
ing much thought to Dr. 
King's contributions to 
community service and 
equaliiy. 

On Ian. 19, a plethora 
of volunteer opportu- 
nities will be available 
across the country. If an 
individual wants lo make 
the upcoming MLK day. 



along with President- 
elect Barack Obama's in- 
augu radon, more mean- 
ingful and prolific it is 
suggested that those in- 
terested seek volunteer 
opportunities around 
their community and 
participate in this Day of 
Service. 

Obama has asked 
the nation to kick off this 
new chapter in history 
by "creating the change 
we ivish to see." accord- 
ing to the usaservice.org 
website. 

Much like the prin- 
ciples of King's life, the 
purpose of community 



service is lo strengthen 
communities, empower 
individuals, and bridge 
barriers, according to the 
mlkday.gov website. 

Those wishing to 
participate can find and 
sign up for local events 
going on near them on 
the www.usaservice.org 
website. Events going 
on around Fort Wayne 
include blood drives and 
working at shelters and 
food banks. Additional 
information about how 
lo volunteer and the his- 
tory of diis day can also 
be found on the mlkday.

Hobby Games Entertain 
During Bad Economy 

Board and Card Games Make A Comeback to Boost Spirits 



ByWilUpchurch 

will upchu'chO gmall.com 



Entertainment buiJ- 
gets aren't what they used 
to be in this weakened 
economy. Cash-strapped 
students and families are 
seeking alternatives to ex- 
pensive trips to the mov- 
ies, bars, and restaurants. 
Enter the hobby game. 

What is a hobby game? 
You've seen games like 
Apples to Apples, Crani- 
um, and Taboo at parties 
and family gatherings, but 
these are just the tip of the 
iceberg. Board and card 
games have seen a ma- 
jor resurgence in recent 
years, with updates to 
classics such as Risk, Axis 
&amp; AUies, and Clue joining 
a new breed of "deeper" 
games being imported 
from Europe. 

These "euro games," as 
they're knoivn by aficiona- 
dos, aren't like the games 
you grew up playing. They 
have elegant rules that 
p rom o te fu n an d engagi ng 



play through player inter- 
action and choices rather 
than random throws of a 
die or draws from a stack 
of cards, 

BoardGameGeek.com 
is the hub of alt things eu- 
rogame, with thousands 
upon thousands of re- 
views, pictures, and a full- 
fledged social network for 
game enthusiasts. Scott 
Alden (username: Aldiel 
built the Geek from the 
ground up', and explains 
the appeal of eurogames 
as "a social experience." 

Perhaps that's the real 
explanation for why hob- 
hy games remain popular 
during tough economic 
times. It's a way to bring 
your friends together for 
an evening that doesn't 
cost anything. 

Whether you pick 
a family game, a party 
game, or a eurogame, 
it's going to set you back 
anywhere from $25 to 
$60. However, all have 
high replay value and are 
usually meant for at least 
three to sis players. If you 
have a group that pitches 



in, buying a new game is 
no more expensive than 
going to see a movie, and 
it's going to pro\'ide many 
nights of entertainment. 

"In the end it's not so 
much about the game, it's 
about the company and 
having fun," Alden says. 




Despite Misconceptions, 

Local Country Bar Is A Big Hit 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

schnpiOlfiiplwedu 



They said that il 
wouldn't last. They said, 
"Fort Wayne just can't 
suppon that kind of es- 
tablishment," hut they 
were wrong! After two and 
a half years. The Neon Ar- 
madillo, Fon Wayne's only 
country bar, is rocking like 
a hurricane. In fact, the 
Journal Gazette recently 
rated them Northeastern 
Indiana's ftl country bar. 
Be forewarned. The 
Neon ArmadiUo 

might not be what 
you first expect. 
There is no me- 
chanical bull, or 
random articles of 
underwear hang- 
ing from the andei 
chandelier (although 
there is a chandelier made 
of antlers.] 

Tony Rafiei. the bars' 
ovmer, sat down with 
The Communicator and 
talked about The Neon 
Armadillo. When asked 
about what makes them 
truly unique he replied, 
"Our attitude. We sell our 
attitude, not our booze. 



People come because of 
the vvay we treat them, 
it's like the old TV show 
Cheers; everyone knows 
each other here." 

When asked about how 
they came up with such a 
unique name, Tony told 
the tale. Months before 
they opened, the country 
music station K-105 held 
a contest. The listeners 
were given the opportu- 
nity to choose the name. 
"Some 




were 
freaky, wild, and scary." 
Out of 1,200 names sub- 
milted, Tlie Neon Arma- 
dillo was the ultimate 
choice. 

They have tons of sup- 
port from the community, 
"K-105 and 92.3 kept us 
alive," revealed Tony. The 
Neon Armadillo and 92.3 



hosts "Crappy Wednes- 
days" once a week, where 
there's a SI cover charge. 
Beer and food costs SI, 
and longnecks are S3, as 
well as you-call-its. This 
is good news for college 
students who can't alTord 
Pierre's on a regular basis. 
"Age is irrelevant " said 
Tony, "Whether you're 
21, 65 or anything in- 
between, young people 
come ivith their parents, 
or by themselves, for an- 
niversaries, twenty-first 
birthdays, or bach- 
elorette parties {of 
which there are 
five or six on any 
given weekend.)" 
Every Thursday 
there are line-danc- 
ng lessons from 6- 
10pm. 
Some big names to 
look forivard to include 
Luke Bryan - Jan. 31, Lost 
Trailers - Jan. 24, Adam 
Gregory - Feb 14, Jason 
Michael Carroll - Feb. 28,

One major benefit (es-

Artificial Red Adds Flavor to 




By Mark Cox 

(OUTuOZBIphvcdu 



In 2007. four young 
musicians came togeth- 
er to form a band. Their 
motives? To bring back 
the soulful vocals and 
catchy riffs to powerful 
original hard rock. After 
releasing their demo EP, 
local radio stations and 
excited fans are attract- 
ed by their mass of ex- 
posure from playing the 
Three Rivers Festival 
stage as well as playing 
shows in the region's 
mo.st popular clubs with 
their originals. Accord- 
ing to their MySpace 



band profile, the quartet 
sounds like "straight-up 
hard rock." 

Mark McLendon 
rocks out on the guitar. 
Jordan Collier takes 
charge of vocals while 
performing barefoot for 
every show. Desmond 
Gullcy plays bass and 
Reece Bada is their 
drummer. Together they 
form Artificial Red. Not 
only have they played 
clubs such as Piere's 
and Columbia Street 
West, but they have 
shared the .stage at the 
Three Rivers Festival 
with Sevendust. With 
the ranging ages of 19- 
20, Artificial Red is a 



unique band that is mak- 
ing a ton of progress for 
a young local band and 
their talent is going to 
take them a long way. 

"The name Artificial 
Red comes from the name 
of a track from an album 
by the band Mad Sea- 
son, a super group from 
the 90's." said McLen- 
don. Their band website 
can be seen at www.ar- 
tificialred.com and their 
band is also featured on 
MySpace and Facebook. 
"We started playing at 
bars and other shows 
when we were 17 and 
18." McLendon com- 
mented. Their songs ap- 
peal to a wide audience 



and musica

it will remove it from my

While a standard ac- 
count is free, a Pro ac- 
count costs S25/year, 
and allows access to RTM 
apps for the iPhone, the 
iPod touch, Blackberry, 
and Windows Mobile. The 
Blackberry and Windows 
Mobile applications sync 
the phone's tasks list with 
RTM. The iPhone/iPod 
app also syncs tasks to 



the phone, but can also 
use the iPhone's location 
awareness to tell which 
tasks are nearby. 

Remember The 
Milk is not perfect. For 
example, only a whole list 
can be shared, not just a 
part. A task can only be 
placed into one list. Once 
a task is over due, RTM 
doesn't send any more 
reminders about it. Us- 
ing RTM without inter- 
net access is problematic 
at best. Aside from these 
small problems though, 
Remember the Milk is an 
excellent to-do manager.

was releasing their mu-

was completely inde-

on a zero budget. The 
film took two days total 
lo shoot in three differ- 
ent locations around Fort 
Wayne as well as one 
month of editing. "The 
most important thing 
we learned was to take 
as many shots from as 
many different angles as 
possible," said McLen- 
don. "The scene can be 
stagnant around Fort 
Wayne with two popu- 
lar extremes— hardcore 
metal bands always 
playing the same stuff 
and electronic emo-pop 
acts with no substance. 
We want to bring back 
catchy guitar riffs with 
soulful vocals in Ihe

lin and Black Sabbath 
set the tone for so many 
generations. It would be 
a great to have an impact 
in redefining a genre."

Sing Strong, Sing Proud: Marion based Rodeo Ruby Love is a favorite among Fort Wayne residents 
as they sang along with the band during songs like "Patience" Saturday night at the Grind Coffee 
House. Opening for the night, C-Ray Harvey began with a small set (bottom left), playing a few 
acoustic versions of Wooden Satellites songs with his wife Andrea. Husband&amp;wife (bottom right), 
an indie-rock band from Bloomington followed after. Husband&amp;wife also stated that they (along 
with Rodeo Ruby Love) are planning to make another appearance in Fort Wayne in early March, 
and would have their new album with them for sale. Rodeo was the obvious choice to end the 
show, since practically every person in the room knew all the words to all the songs.

Bright Spring Fashion 2009 



By Hana Hawash 



As spring looms most influential fashion 

ahead like a mirage in a seasons. lust like in the 

desert of ice, fashion for- spring, fashions are new 

ward thinking students and crisp. Light, floiving 

prepare their closets for fabrics are taking place 



the 2009 spring season. 
Spring i! 



of wool and colors of 

every kind replace 

blacks and browns. 

After what 

seems like a century of 

cold in Fort Wayne, the 

light and bright 

colors almost 

jump out at 

you from 

your 

closet 




shelves. Solid col- 
ors are definitely in 
fashion, as well as 
dainty prints. The 
most popular colors 
for spring are nudes, 
ians, white, and light 
pinks: things with color, 



but that still take on an 
earthy vibe. 

For those who pre- 
fer dark clothing to light 
colors, do not fear. Mix 
earthygreensand browns 
with lighter tan pieces, 
and no, you cannot wear 
army pants unless ,^__ 
you are actually in 
the army. 

When it comes 
to accessories, the 
same idea applies 
to shoes and purs- 
es. Black purses ^^ 
should be replaced 
with white or tan or even 
light brown ones. Though 
its a little bit harder to 
store black shoes, try to 
change it up a little more 
by adding some other 
colors. As for jewelry, its 
either light and delicate 
or big and chunky. Ear- 
rings, especially are be- 
ing worn big again. 

Just like skinny pants, 
heavily studded shoes 
are still in, so do not get 
rid of those, but when it 
comes to jeweled shoes 



and long summer dress- 
es, you might wanna save 
those for later. Most clos- 
ets already have every- 
thing you need to look 
fresh, but if you cannot 
help but buy something 
new, try adding a light, 



No more caked faces 
heavily lined eyes.' 



and 



flowing, ruffled spring 
dress or something cov- 
ered in sequins. Mufflers, 
those triangular scarves 
everyones been wearing, 
are not just for winter. 
Instead of a heavy cot- 
ton fabric, tr&gt;' doing the 
same thing ivith a lighter 
fabric such as chiffon. 
Doing this can add a little 
color to a plain shirt and 
jeans outht. Add a ivide 
or brightly colored belt 
to update a simple dress 
or shirt. 



Although some do not 
always consider it a part 
of fashion, make up, too, 
must he updated with 
spring- o more caked fac- 
es and heavily lined eyes. 
Along with your ward- 
robe, brighten up your 
^^^^ face. For eye- 
shadow, try light 
greens, pinks 
and peachy 

tones. T^ wear- 
ing a chapstick 
with SPF instead 
=;^^ of lipstick, and 
wear minimal 
foundation. TYy using a 
concealer on limited ar- 
eas of die face such as 
dark circles or uneven 
skin tones, then cover the 
whole face with a light 
all-over powder. Finish 
off with a light, peachy 
blusher and a lot of dark 
mascara, and to make the 
eyes really pop, wear faux 
diamond study earrings 
(or the real thing, if you 
can afford them); they 
make beautifully natural 
eyes sparkle.

Cal Poly students deal with 
black-athlete stereotype 

By Omar Sanchez and get bogged down about things like that because

The biggest problem with the campus' lack of 

iually ethnic diversity, he said, is its "undercover racism. " 

Consequently, he wasn't surprised to hear about 

the recent case invoKing a noose, a Confederate flag

Wrapping up a game in college sports 
means an athlete lakes off his or her jersey and heads 
for the showers. Once the jersey is off, most athletes 
blend right in with the masses. At Cal Poly, though, 
many black athletes say their student peers always 
see them with a jersey on. 

"One of the first tilings I remember when I came to 

this school is at a party, someone asked' me, 'So what call black kids n s here and there. It's just a feeling

Lumpkin could also recall acts of racism that were 

directed at him off campus, 

"There are times when I'm out and about and I'll

Coming from Salinas, where 
the community is largely Latino, 
Lumpkin has come to cope with 
a lack of ethnic diversity at home 
and at schopl.

Wells sought comfort with 
her team. 

" We all feel passionately 
about each other and we're all

came together and spoke about

percentage throughout the 23-campus CSU system.

For some, those questions concerning recruiting

Mixon scores 
a career high 
as IPFW tops 
Centenary 

leremy Mixon scored a career-high 20 points 
and IPFW held back a frenzied Centenary College 
comeback in stopping theGents, 68-64 on Saturday 
afternoon at the Gold Dome in Shrevepon, 
Louisiana. 

After holding a slim, 29-28 lead at the half, IPFW 
began to open things up in the second half. 

Junior forward DeilvezYearby got it started with 
a one-handed slam off of an assist from starting 
point guard Zach Plackemeier. 

Following a 3-poinEer by junior guard Nick 
Daniels, Mixon slashed to the hoop for back-to- 
back layups to. give the Mastodons a 40-32 lead. 

Daniels and Mixon combined for most of 
IPFW'sscoringina24-10run to open the half and 
give the 'Dons their biggest lead of the contest at 
55-38 with just 5:04 left. 

Sensing they had nothing left to lose. Centenary 
began to sell out on the defensive end. The Gents 
went full court pressure for the remained of the 
game and climbed back into it as guards Nick 
Stallings and Gary Redus II began to heat up. 

Redus hit a short jumper to draw the Gents to 
within 12 at 63-51. 

After a Stallings jumper and a three-point play 
by Redus, the IPFW lead was cut to six at 64-58 
with 1:43 remaining. 

Stallings then slashed to thetiasket. His layup 
was good and he was fouled in the act. Fortunately 
for the 'Dons, Stallings missed the bonus. 

A Redus layup with :22 left cut the Mastodon 
lead to 64-62, but that is as close as Centenary 
would get. 

Mb(on, Vearby, and senior fonvard David 
Carson hit foul shots in the final 20-seconds to lift 
IPFW to their second conference win of the year. 

Along with Mixon, IPFW got double-digit 
scoring games from Carson (15). Vearby (131, and 
Daniels (11).

The Men's Baskelbal! regular

With a losing record (7-10) and a 
negatively unpredicted position in die

seem to be stuck in a rut.

"Highland has an excellent 
coaching staff and Pete Norman was a 
great coach," Daniels said. "We played 
good teams and it was nice coming 
out on top." 

Now that Nick is playing NCAA 
Division I basketball, things for him 
have changed a little to say the least. 

"Division 1 is way different.

are longer and there is less free time.
