IPFW professor 

reevaluates 

the ontological 
status of coconuts 



By Douglas Schmidt 



1 Jr^rijpr this week, 
IPFW biology professor 
Dura Maier made a slar- 
tling discovery. Coconuts 
have long been consid- 
ered just a plant, good 
for nothing but sunlan 
lotion and Almond Joys. 
However, Prof. Maler has 
determined that they are 
actually mammals. When 
asked for comment, the 
head of ihe biology de- 
partment said, "Really? 
Holy crap!" 




The true nature of 
coconuts has long puz- 
zled philosophers, poets 
and other unemployed 
people, but Prof Mater 
cracked the story, be- 
ginning to examine co- 
conuts three years ago, 
while attending a luau. 
The hula dancers were 
not amused. 

After this, the world 
renowned professor be- 
gan his famous research 
into coconut mating 
rituals. He was tlie first 



person to hear the coco- 
nut mating call, which 
he describes as "a sound 
like a cat being sawed in 
half." 

During mating, coco- 
nuts become extremely 
territorial. When threat- 
ened, they fall out of the 
tree, hoping to strike their 
enemies on the head and 
give them amnesia. 

After years of long, 
hard, sweaty, smelly, itchy 
research. Prof Mater un- 
covered several startling 



facts about coconuts: 

1. Coconuts produce 
milk or "lactatify." 

2. Coconuts are hairy 
little buggers. 

3. The edible part of 
a coconut is called "the 
meat," just like the edible 
part of a person. 

4. Coconut milk can 
be used as a replacement 
for blood plasma, which 
must be true because he 
read it in Wlkipedia. 

5. Coconuts like to 
vote for Ralph Nader. 



Thus, coconuts have 
milk, hair, meat, blood 
and leftist political lean- 
ings. Coconuts are mam- 
mals, which is why youVe 
allowed to marry a coco- 
nut in Gary, Indiana. 

Prof. Mater is still at- 
tempting to determine 
which animal family co- 
conuts belong to. They 
could be members of the 
goldfish family, or possi- 
bly a kind of fruit bat. 

One of the professor's 
coconuts won the West- 



minster Dog Show last 
week, so coconuts may 
also be a kind of poodle. 
But, then again, the judg- 
es might have just been 
being nice. 

To celebrate the dis- 
covery, a local pet store. 
Fur Sure, is giving away 
a free coconut with ev- 
ery purchase of an emo- 
tionally disturbed wiener 
dog. Puppy antidepres- 
sants not included.

After two incredibly 
close presidential 

elections, the youth vote 
may be the deciding 
factor in 2008, The 
election of 2000 only saw 
a 36 percent youth voter 
turnout, a 25-year low. 
However, the youth vote 
in 2004 rebounded with 
a spike of 11 percent. 
Despite this aggressive 
improvement, the 

current election season 
is expected to receive 
another jolt 

in youth voter 
turnout. 

A presidential 
poll by Harvard 
University's 
Institute of 

Politics projected 
upwards or 77 
percent of younger 
voters will turn out this 
year. This steep increase 
in turnout is due to a 
number of different 
reasons, including 

candidates reaching 
out to die youth, the 
relevancy of political 
issues to them and close 
primaries, 

Barack 



reaped success, other 
candidates also made 
efforts to entice the 
youth as well. 

Facebook and 

MySpace pages are 
the popular ways to 
attract - young voters, 
but candidates have 
also launched other 
television and Internet 



Key issues in tliis 
election are the war in 
Iraq, fought by this age 
group, and a declining 
economy that seems 
unwelcoming to those 
preparing to leave school 
and enter the business 
world. 

"One of the most 
important issues is the 



the youth. 

"This will be my first 
lime voting." first year 
student Maggie Maher 
said. "It is good to see 
candidates reach out to 
the younger generation. 
I have started to pay 



campaigns to appeal to economy." junior Arista 
Thieme said. "Younger 
people are graduating 
college and are looking 
for jobs. They want a 
good economy to look 
fonvard to. " 

The fact dial this 

primary season, 

especially that of 

the Democrats.

also intrigues 

younger voters. 

The enthusiasm 

of the presidential 

nominations has 

sparked up a lot 

of interest and the youth 

has responded. 

In several states, the 
youth vote has doubled 
since 2004 and in 
stales such as Iowa and 
Missouri the turnout has 
even tripled.

The IPSGA elections -What is at stake? 



By DOUGLAS SCHMIDT

The Indiana Purdue 
Student Government 
Association elections are 
fast approaching. While 
they may not affect the 
country asdramaticallyas 
the presidential election, 
an individual student 
has a far greater chance 
of actually determining 
die outcome of an (PSGA 
election. 

Kody Tinnel is 
running for student 
body president, When 
asked about his goals 



for his first term, Tinnel 
said that he wanted 
to "make the student 
body more active and 
as President I would 
have the means to do 
so more effectively. In 
addition IPSGA needs 
a leader with Student 
Government knowledge 
and experience, both of 
which 1 have and my 
opponent jDeAngelo 
LaVette) docs not." 

LaVeite stated 

that his leadership 
experience comes from 
outside of student 
government. He said 
that he can offer IPSGA 
more diversity, as he 



can reach out to minority 
students, who would 
feel like they are more 
likely to be heard. He also 
mentioned his close ties 



to 



die 



campus, 



childcare program, 

which he believes will 
not increase tuition for 
childless students.

some control over how 
their money is spent."

does not.

with the student body and

LaVettc will work 
to expand the student 



winner, 
it also 
allows 
students to have some 
control over how their 
money is spent. 

"Student government 
is in charge of a lot 
of money paid in by 
students," Tinnel said. "It 
is good to know how that 
money is being spent," 



Although he is not 
yet in office, Tinnel has 
already faced his first 
minor scandal. Recently, 
The Communicator 
was contacted about a 
message Tinnel posted 
on Facebook. According 
to the email. Tinnel 
wrote on the site about 
Sen. Hillary Clinton, 
saying that "someone 
needs to rape and kill 
diat stupid b""." 

Tinnel was sent an 
email from a student 
voter concerned about 
the message. It would 
have been simple to 
delete the controversial 
post and pretend it did 



not happen, but Tinnel 
replied to the student, 
saying that his comment 
was simply a joke, albeit 
one in bad taste, 

"The simple fact that 
the statement was made 
on ...facebook shows 
that it isn't exactly the 
most serious, sincere, 
or honest thing I would 
say.. [but actu^lyl 
the immature words 
used during informal 
conversations with 

friends."

Is Barack Obama truly anti-war? 

The young senator's voting record and early speeches cast some doubts 



OP-ED 
By DOUGLAS SCHMIDT 

schmdnQieiphvedu 



Sen. Barack Obama 
has clearly positioned 
himself as the antiwar 
democratic candidate. 
Unlike his opponent, 
Sen. Hillary Clinton, 
he did not vote for the 
original resolution that 
gave President Bush the 
authority to go to war 
with Saddam Hussein. 
However, he may be less 
worthy of the "antiwar 
candidate" title than his 
supporters beLeve. 

Would Obama have 
voted for the resolution 
if he had been in office? 
hi an article in July 26, 
2004's New York Times. 
he seemed imcertain. 

Obama said that, 
unlike Sen. John Kerry 
and Sen. lohn Edwards, 



he was "not privy to 
Senate intelligence 

reports... What would I 
have done? I don't know. 
What 1 know is that from 
my vantage point tiie 
case was not made." 

Other members of 
Congress had apparently 
been convinced by the 
intelligence available at 
the time. The day after 
the article was published, 
Obama appeared to be 
convinced, as well. 

During a speech at 
the Democratic National 
Convention in Boston, 
Obama spoke of a young 
man who had enlisted 
in the Marines and was 
about to be sent to Iraq. 
"And as I listened to 
him explain why he had 
enlisted - the absolute 
faith he had in our 
country and its leaders, 
his devotion to duty and 
service - I thought, this 



young man was all that 
any of us might ever 
hope for in a child." 

Obama added that 
Americans had an 
obligation to "never, 
ever go to war ivithout 
enough troops to win 
the war, secure the peace 
and earn the respect of 
the world." 

That same day, 
Obama told the Chicago 
Tribune that he was not 
in favor of pulling out 
of Iraq at the present 
time and, in that respect, 
"there's not much of a 
difference between my 
position and George 
Bush's position at this 
stage." 

In Obama's short time 
as a senator, he has voted 
many times to fund the 
war in Iraq. Since he 
took office, Obama has 
voted for more than $300 
billion in additional war

Welcome 

^^to the 

madhous 



X wo parts mys- 
tery, three parts action 
and one part sex, "Mad- 
house" hit shelves in 
February vvith a bang. 
The relieved sigh of 
the fans who had been 
waiting in trepidation 
for nearly a year for 
this third installment 
in the Leandros Broth- 
ers series was heard 
across the nation. Rob 
Thurman returns to her 
twisted fairy tale world 
and ensnares her audi- 
ence once again in this 
spooky thriller. 

The story focuses 
around CaJ and Niko 
Leandros, two Romani 
brothers who live in 
New York City and hire 
out as supernatural 
bounty hunters. Both 
are caught up in a race 
to find a mad, murder- 
ous monster who is 
slaughtering New York- 
ers and leading an army 
of the pseudo-undead. 
They're also out to find 



ByZACHARYHORNBACK 



the person who hired 
assassins to kill their 
friend and comrade, 
Robin Goodfellow. On 
top of all that, Cal is 
also struggling with the 
emotional detachment 
that he grew up with 
because of his own 
monstrous lineage. 

The plot is intense - 
this book is hard to put 
down. It is thrilling and 
Thurman's mythology 
hits right on the mark. 
Vampires, werewolves, 
boggles and redcaps 
are simple a few of the 
monsters. The setting 
is a supernatural side 
of New York that fuels 
this cynical and sur- 
real narrative. Living 
mummies and demon 
chickens punctuate 
a story that is at once 
whimsical and terrify- 
ingly dark. Thurman 
doesn'l shy away from 
gruesome death, but 
instead uses il accen- 
tuate her villains lo a 
demonic perfection. 




This book is Thur- 
man's best work to date, 
with wonderful charac- 
ters, vivid settings and 
a compelling plot. This 
book is a must- read, ris- 
ing to number three on 
the charts at both Barnes 
&amp; Noble and Borders. 
Thurman has contribut- 
ed fantastically to the ex- 
panding genre of urban 
fantasy with her work so 
far and we all should an- 
ticipate her next release 
in the Leandros Brothers' 
story.

Texas A&amp;M Student Wins 

MTVU Music Video Contest 



By BEN JOHNSON 

CourUiyofUWIRE 



Unwittingly setting 
into motion events that 
would drastically shape 
her immediate future, 
Lauren Simpson, Texas 
A&amp;M University student 
decided to check out 
this particular banner. 
The advertisement led 
her to mtvu.com, where 
she discovered a con- 
test. The contest chal- 
lenged anyone with the 
creative ability to pitch 
an idea for the next Mo- 
tion City Soundtrack 
music video. The wrinner 
would get the chance to 
bring his or her vision to 
life and direct the music 
video for Motion City 
Soundtrack's latest sin- 



gle. "It Had to Be You." 
Several weeks later, 
after submitting her 
idea, the eager Texas 
A&amp;M graduate student 
received an email. 

'At first the mes- 
sage just said my sub- 
mission was one of 
the finalists and they 
wanted to get some 
more specifics. All I 
had submitted was re- 
ally just a sort of out- 
line and some illustra- 
tions," she said. "I was 
really excited. 1 didn't 
even think mine would 
end up winning, but I 
was thrilled that 1 was 
a finalist. " 

Simpson continued 
to correspond with the 
officials of the con- 
test, as well as Justin 
Pierre, the band's lead 



vocalist. Several more 
days passed as Simpson 
wailed for the call that 
would inevitably change 
her plans for the next 
several weeks. Simpson 
said she was ecstatic 
when she was contacted 
with the information that 
her submission had been 
chosen. 

"I was so excited. I 
couldn't believe that my 
submission had won. 
The opportunity to do 
professional work that 
millions of people would 
get a chance to see was 
thrilling," Simpson said. 

With the video com- 
pleted and available now 
for everyone to see on 
mtv.com and mtvu.com, 
Simpson Is moving on to 
be an animator at Pixar

Legendary Film 

Comes to DVD 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN

Will Smith is back, 
starring in the third ver- 
sion of "1 Am Legend", 
as Robert Neville, the 
last man alive after a 
supposed cancer cure 
turns most of humanity 
into blood thirsty, vam- 
pire-type monsters. 

Originally debuted as 
a sci-fi novel in 1954 by 
Richard 
M a t h e - 
son, it 
has been 
made 
into two 
previous 
films. The 
Last Man 
On Earth 
starring 

Vincent Price in 1964, 
and The Omega Man in 
1971 starring Charlton 
Heston. 

Now, it's Will Smith's 
tiun, and instead of the 
futuristic drama taking 
place in a devastated 
Los Angeles, it is now 
New York City's turn to 
become decimated by 
disease, leaving only 
Dr, Robert Neville and 
his dog, Sam to save the 
world. 

Admittedly, 1 know 
nothing about the zom-

the truth revealed 

1^ Bringing 
/ Down 

L 1 1 the House 




By MARISHA ZIMMERMAN 

eiptvLtdu 



The new movie "21," 
which opened in the- 
aters Mar. 28, claims lo 
be the true story of six 
MIT students who took 
Vegas for millions, but 
the true story was ac- 
tually written by Ben 
Mezrich, and the mov- 
ie is only loosely based 
on his book. "21: Bring- 
ing Down the House," 
which was originally 
published in 2002, Iclls 
the true story of Kev- 
in Lewis (not his real 
name, of course) and 
his part in a group of 
students from MIT who 
formed an elite team of 
card counters that were 
able to take millions of 
dollars from Casinos 
in Las Vegas, as well as 
thousands from other 
casinos around the 
country. 

Kevin, who is also a 
mathematics genius, 
was introduced to card 
counting by two of his 
friends and took to it 
immediately. He origi- 
nally sees card count- 
ing as another math 
problem, a mathemati- 
cal challenge with high 
stakes and a big payoff. 



As time goes on, he be- 
comes a vital part of the 
group and, as a result, 
begins to lead a double 
life. 

On the weekdays, 
he's a quiet and intel- 
ligent student with a 
girlfriend, while on 
weekends he lives as 
one ofhis nine different 
alter egos in Las Vegas, 
winning big bucks and 



are only changing how 
they bet based on the 
cards in the game. 

These characters, 
along with others, justi- 
fy their actions through 
this explanation of card 
counting, but in the 
end none of them can 
deny how much they 
enjoy the payoff. By 
the time he graduates, 
Kevin is torn betiveen 



"They justify their card counting 

by saying it isn't illegal: they bet 

based on the cards in the game; 

the outcome isn't changed." 



enjoying the good life 
most people only wish 
they could win. His 
personal life, however, 
begins to suffer when 
he can't tell anyone ex- 
actly what he's doing 
on the weekends. 

Throughout the sto- 
ry, Kevin and several 
of the other characters 
must keep reminding 
themselves that what 
they are doing is not Il- 
legal because they are 
not changing the out- 
come of the game; they 



two worlds and works 
to successfully inhabit 
both. 

V^ile the major- 
ity of the book t^es 
place in the mid-nine- 
ties, the author also in- 
cludes chapters in the 
present day, describ- 
ing his meetings and 
interviews with various 
characters in the sto- 
ry. By including these 
meetings, he offers in- 
sights into the personal 
motivations, decisions, 
feelings, and actions of 



the some of the char- 
acters. 

This personal in- 
sight offers explana- 
tions of how the char- 
acters were able to pull 
of the elaborate plans 
for taking a casino and 
how they were able to 
live with their actions 
as card counters. 

Mezrich seems to 
make an argument for 
card counting as be- 
ing part of a way to 
achieve the American 
dream. At the same 
time he seems to trj' lo 
show how this Ameri- 
can dream can affect 
ones life. "21; Bring- 
ing Down the House" 
tells an exciting and 
detailed story that kept 
this reader turning the 
pages eagerly.

Way back in Febru- 
ary there was a feature 
article in the A&amp;E sec- 
tion about a student 
with an ambitious 
venture. Flavorsaurus 
Threads, by JustinHein, 
recently opened up its 
online store. The store 
is still in its infancy, 
but sports an amusing 
FAQ and several cloth- 
ing options to order. My 
personal favorite is the 
question of how to take 
care of your Flavorsau- 
rus clothing. Their an- 
swer? 



"Please don't wash 
the shirts widi glass, 
rocks, or knives. They 
tend to beat up your 
shirt pretty bad. We say 
wash them in cold and 
(lip your shirt inside 
out, that ivay tlie design 
stays so fresh and clean 
over time." 

Flavorsaurus 
Threads is a clothing 
line cunailing to the 
punk or Warped Tour 
scene, with clothing 
priced around S20.

IPFW tests new safety alert system 

Campus security gets an upgrade by incorporating 
software, speaker, telephone systems into safety program 



By LOUISA DANrELSON 

DanilaD2eiplw.edu 



In this day and age, 
police and safety does 
not jus! mean check- 
ing parking meters and 
locking doors - it means 
working through any 
means possible to help 
protect students and 
staff on campus. 

This \vas demon- 
strated recently by a test- 
ing of ihe newest secu- 
rity software that IPFW 
recently began using. 
Called Reverse 911, this 
software system allows 
campus police to send 
alerts to students across 
the campus via campus 



Thursday, Mar. 20 was a 
drj' run of the 'slow pace' 
system -such as warn- 
ings of weather alerts 
and lower- caliber emer- 
gencies. There was a 90 
percent success rate for 
the telephone side of the 
system. Approximately 
42 percent of calls were 
picked up and 48 percent 
of calls reached answer- 
ing machines. 

"We were above the 
norm on that." said Po- 
lice Chief Lauren Den- 
hanog. But the e-mail 
alerts however did not 
work as well. 

"We were watching it 
and boy, this one's fast 
- then it dropped to 450 
e-mails... (and it) came 
to a grinding slowdown," 



"What's become increasingly evident is 

that we need the best way of notifying 

students and faculty."

The police are also 
looking into synchro- 
nizing the electronic 
signboards, like those 
on the parking garages 
and over the walkway 
between Neff and Class- 
room Medical, so that an

"What's become in- 
creasingly evident is that 
we need the best way of

College and high 
school students have a 
chance lo participate in a 
favorite Indiana pastime 
with one of the presiden- 
tial candidates. 

The presidential pri- 
mary election is coming 
up in Indiana on May 
6, The competition be- 
tween the two Demo- 
cratic candidates Is high- 
ly contested this election 
year, which makes every 
vote more valuable to the 
candidates. 

In order to vole in this 
election, one must regis- 
ter to vote by April 7. 

For the purpose of 
Increasing voter registra- 
tionandvotinglngeneral, 



^ 
^ 
^ 



especially among young 
people, the Obama cam- 
paign has launched a 
competition in Indiana. 
This event Is called the 
"Three-on-Three Chal- 
lenge for Change." 

If an Indiana college 
or liigh school student 
is able to get 30 people 
registered to vote be- 
fore April 6, the winning 
college student will be 
eligible for a chance to 
play a ihtec-on-ihrce 
basketball game with 
Senator Barack Obama. 
The selected high school 
student will get lo play 
against Obama and his 
team. 

To learn more Infor-

event, one can visit the

look at text messaging. 



lit Is! definitely down the 
road, ' said Denhartog. 

The newest buildings 
on campus have differ- 
ent hre alarm and 
tornado warning 
systems than the 
older buildings. 
Tradition ally, a 
fire alarm is sig- 
naled by flash- 
ing strobe lights 
and a continu- 
ous siren blaring 
through the halls. 
Tornado warn- 
ings are indicated 
by a pulsing siren 
and no lights. 

Now. in the 
new music build- 
mg, the alarm system 
broadcasts a voice stat- 
ing whether it's a fire or 
tornado alarm, and tell- 
ing people what to do. As 



buildings are created or 
renovated, the new sys- 
tem will be installed. 

Denhartog noted that 
in his 32 years of service 
on campus, there have 
never been any major 
fires or tornados to hit 
the school. Not to say 
the alarms never go off 

- "There's so many sen- 
sors... that dust, steam, 
etc. will trigger a false 
alarm," he said. 

Fire alarms are tested 
when the school is empty 

- usually in the middle 
of the night. Fire extin- 
guishers are also checked 
routinely and quarterly 
reports are sent to staff 
and faculty. "(I take) ev- 
ery chance I can to get 
information out," Den- 
hanog said.

Mayweather crosses barrier, shines at Wrestlemania 

In All Directions 



By DAN VANCE 

vance-tad.b1ogspot.» 



"It's not easy." 

That was Floyd Mayweather's first thought lie 
passed on to the media after his pro wresding debut 
on Sunday's WWE Wrestlemania show. 

Easy or not, Ma&gt;'weather made it look pretty good 
and mildly entertaining. And in such, boxing's best 
pound-for-pound fighter look a step and crossed a 
barrier that no man really has before. He has made 
the transition from fan favorite athlete to legit bad 
guy in the male soap opera world of the WWE. 

Other celebrities and athletes have attempted to 
make crossovers, usually at Wresdemania, several 
times over the last decade. Bui none could be 
considered as ividely publicized or successful as 
Floyd Mayweather's appearance last Sunday. 

Not only did Mayweather get the ivin (ihe WWE 
wasn't paying him to come and lose), but he was 



entertaining in the process. And he was entertaining 
booked as the bad guy in the match. And if anyone 
has ever watched Mayiveather's personality, they 
know that he is far from the bad guy. 

Mayweather showed that he can be a character. 
And let's face it, that is what pro wrestling is about, 
right? And while he was obviously out of his element, 
he put on a good shoiving for a guy who's never been 
in that kind of ring before. 

From his faux-fur shorts to his "Philthy Rich" 
medallion, Mayiveather found an amazing new 
medium to showcase his over the lop personality. 

Will he pass on boxing, retire at 39-0 and become 
the WWE's next evil intruder? Doubtful. But it was 
fun to watch for one night. 

The bottom line is that Mayweather is the first 
athlete to cross this shaky barrier and be successful. 

Do I think more athletes should do this? Absolutely 
not (said with a smile). Honestly, 1 don't really 
think that anybody else could pull this oEf quite like 
"Money " Mayweather did. 

It was a once in a lifetime kind of thing and the 




CHAIR: Floyd Mayweather used a chair to help 
pick up his first pro wrestling victory. 

WWE and Mayweather both did their best. It was 
worth the watch anyway and that says a lot about 
the appeal of Mayweather in general as his real sport 
continues its' decline.

Bell's 'Operation name change' 



Athletic Director speaks on changing of the 
guard, dropping of Mastodon moniker 

AUilelic Director Tommy Beli addressed the studenl 
body (well, the 12 that showed up) on Tuesday during his 
first annual "State of IPFW Athletics Address brought to 
you by Foot Locker©" at Gates Sports Center. 

Bell, who replaced Mark Pope last summer rambled 
on for nearly two hours about how it was time for some 
changes at IPFW, first noting that new mascot was very 
badly needed, 

"Mastodon? I mean, are we serious? I am pretty sure 
the morons who came up with this name were watching 
too much Power Rangers," Bell said with a jolly chuckle. 
"Oh, it was Rep. Mark Souder? Weil that makes all of the 
sense in the world now honesUy," 

In coordination with that decision, Bell has launched 
"Operation Name Change' to get word around about 
IPFW's new moniker: the Fighting Pifia Coladas, 
.. Also, Bell has decided that the school colors need to 
change to purple and neon green. 

He noted that he doesn't really care what the Summit 
League or commissioner Tom Douple have to say about 
the changes. 

'What does that punk know? " 

In another highly controversial move, Bell has decided 
to do some rearranging of the sports. 

"So Pope dropped track and added golf; that's amateur. 
I say. let's drop women's basketball and baseball in favor 
of something that ivill be more interesting. How about 
hand ball? Now that's a sport. And who else has it? Thafs 
right. Tommy Bell bringing IPFW it's first national title! 
Put that in your pipe and smoke it lUPUT." 

'This is terrible," said women's basketball coach Chris 
Paul. "I worked hard to get this team where it is and he's

PURPLE &amp; GREEN: AD Tommy Bell is happy about 
his laniJmark changes. Others were not so positive 
while some stayed optimistic about handball, 

dropping us? But then again, I am pretty bad-ass with a 
handball." 

"Ya know, I could use a Pina Colada." Dane Fife 
added. 

Conveniently, he now can just drink the mascot.

S^// tdps Fife 

in Masto-Brawl III 

Basketball is the top college sport 
offered by IPFW. Volleyball is the school's 
claim to fame. That alone was enough to 
bring the long awaited Amie Ball/Dane 
Fife feud into the ring. 

Despite giving up a substantial age 
difference, Ball defeated Fife in front of 
an estimated 16 fans at the third annual 
Masto-Brawl event Ball used the "Spike of 
Death," powerslam to derail the upstart, 

"Him?Hewasacakeivalk,"Ballsaidafter 
the match. "I have underwear older than 
Dane Fife and toenails longer and more 
successhil than his coaching career." 

In the highly anticipated rematch 
of their 2006 Ladder Match, Don the 
Mastodon fell to Boilermaker Pete in a 
Taipei Death Match. We are certain reports 
will show that Don died of semi-natural 
causes. 

Also on the undercard, Chas Parry 
upset hoards of others to win a men's and 
women's soccer battle royal. The match 
was considered a win-win no matter the 
winner because at least the soccer program 
would win something this year. 

A proposed cockfight between baseball 
coach Billy Gemon's new warrior "I Miss 
Keena," and women's volleyball coach 
Kelly Hartley's "Kill Bird," was cancelled 
after Gemon's 3Glh arrest on organization 
of illegal cockfighting rings within the last 
72 months.
