^QcK ;10.\^-1Q 



On Wednesday, Tlarch 
l8, former congressman 
Ed Koush met with a 
small group of students 
here at the i''ort wayae- 
cp.mpus for an informal 
discussion on Ilr. 
Roush' s political cam- 
paign for congressman 
and some of the ideas 
and opinions he has on 
both local and national 
issues. 

As for initiating 
his political cp.mpaif^ 
for congressman of the 
fourth district in 1970, 
Mr. Koush and his sup- 
porters have already 
started gathering back- 
ground and speech mat- 
erial, as will as re- 
cruiting interested 
persons to help and 
staj?t a financial drive 
in order to obtain the 
necessary operating 
funds which axe now so 
desparately needed. 

In a question and 
answer period, Mr. 
Housh was asked his op- 
inion on a Vietnam pol- 
icy for withdrawal. In 
response he stated that 
his position was the 
same as that of Senator 
Muskie of Maine — we 
should have a complete 
withdrawal from Vietnam 
wxthin eighteen months.

the A. E.G. and theLS.A. 

The A.R.G. which 
stands for Association 
of Regional Campuses, 
includes just regional 
campuses and no main 
ones. The A.R.G. was 
started a few years ago; 
its purpose is to unify 
students on regional 
campuses and to provide 
lobbying and equal 
rights for regional 
campus students. The 
A.R.G. is noe in the 
process of writing a 
new constitution to 
better organize and 
strengthen it.

and the idea of a Walk 
for Development in the 
Us was conceived. The 
Walk idea is not a new 
one. It originated in 
Europe and has also been 
carried out in Ganada, 

There are six goals 
of a Walk of this na- 
ture . There would be 
total community in- 
volvement in:l. to edu- 
cate and sensitize the 
community to the needs 
for action in the hun- 
ger crises. 

2. to collect large 
Slims of money which 
will be used to combat 
hunger and the condi- 
tions that lead to hun- 
ger. 

5. to channel and coor- 
dinate the efforts of 
young people into pos- 
itive action to combat 
a major international 
problem. 

4. to inspire youth in 
other cities to begin 
similar programs for 
fighting hunger. 

5. to strengthen the 
image of youth in the 
community in a positive 

way. 

6. to unite and streng- 
then the entire commu- 
nity by speaking and 
doing. C.on\, ou P&lt;j.3

approximately 50 miles, 
each walker going as far 
as he can. Each person 
is to obtain pledges 
from 1 or more sponsors 
if he can. The sponsor 
must agree to donate at 
least a set amount for 
each mile. Each walker 
will have his check- 
point card stamped at 
various points along 
the route. After the 
walk, the walker will 
show his sponsor the 
check-point card and the 
sponsor will jay him the

The walk donations will 
then be turned in to a 
collection center near 
the valker inFort Wayne. 
All money is finally 
collected and placed in 
a Walk account in a lo-

Since hunger and mal-

both a domestic and ovei&gt;-

CARNIVAL ANTICS BRING 
ES FROM HEAVEN 



Saturday night, March 
15, will be thought of 
by 214 children as a 
iiappy» fun-filled eve- 
ning-one that may never 
be forgotten* It was 
the night of the annual 
Penny Carnival put on 
by the Student Union 
Board with participa- 
tion form various orga- 
nizations and clubs. 

Of the 214 children, 
97 were orphans from 
the Ft. Wayne Childreh's 
PIome,St, Vincent Villa, 
and the Ft. Wayne State 
School; 57 were children 
from the Riverhaven 
area; and the remaining 
50 were from the Ft. 
Wayne State School. To 
help these children Haire 
an enjoyable evening, 
"sponsors "we re assigned 
to each child. Some of 
the sponsors were with 
the orphans from the Ft. 
Wayne State School, with 
many faculty members, 
members of the general 
public, and lU-PU stu- 
dents naking up the rest 
of the list of sponsors 
for the children. 

Various clubs and or- 
ganizations took part 
in the Penny Carnival 
by having booths and 
games for the children. 
Of the thirteen booths, 
three were given tro- 



phies 2&lt;jr bexiife -xic 
best. The "Most Enthu- 
siastic" award vbb given 
to the Dental Hygienists 
with their 'Twister 
Board'.The Dental Assis- 
tants won the "Most Ori- 
ginal" title with "Flip- 
per and His Friends'.And 
the trophy for the "Best 
Overall" was given to 
the Alpha Psi Omega So- 
rority with their 'Three 
Ring Circus ' , The Uni- 
versity Singers were al- 
so a part of the pro- 
gram with a concert in 
the middle of the eve- 
nihg. 

The Carnival was con- 
sidered an overall suc- 
cess by the children, 
sponsors, and organiza- 
tion members alike. The 
proceeds of S277.52 will 
go to the Behavior Mo- 
dification Department 
of the Ft, Wayne State 
School, 

To top the evening 
off, one of the orphans 
provided his own perso- 
nal excitement for him- 
self and the rest of the 
children by pulling the 
Fire Alarm and instiga- 
ting his own Fire Drill. 
All of the children 
thought it qiite a treat 
tr;be so promptly visited 
by the Ft. Wayne Fire 
Department, to say the 
least 1 



faQr. 



Senate Meets 



The March 16, 1970 
tstudent oenate meeting 
was beg;iin at 8:50 p.m. 
by an ap;end.a report 
given by Senator 
Maurice I'Jmery. 

Jim Goestch, General 
Chairman of the Walk 
for Development slated 
for April 26th, was in- 
troduced to the Senate. 
Geestch proceeded to 
give an outline of the 
Walk and Senatro Paul 
Green was appointed as 
representative of the 
Regional Campus to at- 
tend future meetings for 
the organization of the 
Walk. 

An interested stu- 
dent petitioned for a 
seat on the Senate but 
due to an upcoming USO 
tour which will take 
him out of the country ■ 
for a month^he was not 
seated. 

The question of fi- 
nan.ces was finally ap- 
proached with a motion 
made by Senator Dave 
C^uance which read, "I 
move to allocate t^2,000 
to the COMI'lUNIGATOR vith 
astipulation that a pre- 
vious debt of 'il&gt;250 be 
paid back to Doug 
Schrock." Much discus- 
sion followed and even- 
tually the motion was 
defeated. Tiore discus- 
sion ensued and was en- 
ded by a motion make by 
Senator Don Stuckey 
which stated, "I move 
to give i^$0 to the COM- 
MUNICATOR from the Sen- 
ate funds." The motion 
was passed. 

At that time the 
quorum was broken and 
the meeting dispersed,. 



that in the area_ of 
pollution researching, 
our country iias been 
delinquent and event- 
ually the anti-pol- 
lution efforts will 
have to exceed those of 
the space program. 

When asked to what 
extent a congressman 
from our area could 
affect situations at 
the I.U.-P.U. campus, 
Mr. Roush stated that 
there is always a diff- 
iculty in trying to 
measure influence; how- 
ever, he did admit the 
presence of political 
influence on university 
administrations. He 
feels the question is 
rather, will the cong- 
ressman use his influ- 
ence for education. 



On the current issue 
of bussing children in 
the iPort Wayne area out 
of their own school 
district for the pur- 
pose of integration, 
Koush believes that the 
main complaint of the 
opposition to such a 
plan is not the quest- 
ion of integration but 
rather the impractic- 
ality of unnecessarily 
transporting children 

to other schools. 
Roush supports such a 
plan, but sees the bus- 
sing aspect as only a 
temporary comdition. 

Mr. Roush concluded 
by voicing his faith in 
young college students 
and professional people 
who will help him give 
people of the fourth 
district a better cam- 
paign than at the last 
election.

HERE'S WHAT YOU SAID 
question for this week 
is; If the University 
were to fall apart and 
you were to start it 
over again, what would 
he the first thing you 
would change? 

Mike Musbaumer - The 

ruling class — the Uni- 
versity is one of those 
institutions where the 
people who make the de- 
cisions have lost com- 
plete contact with 
their captive constit- 
uency. The Administra- 
tive Glass in the -Uni- 
versity have spun their 
own web of unpenetratap 
ble bureaucracy. They 
are so preoccupied with 
status climbing, and 
the production of a 
"smooth-operating ma- 
chine , " that they have 
forgotten the reason 
for their existence. 
The University should 
exist for the students; 
for upon their educa- 
tion rests the future 
of this country. With 
the present system, 
students are becoming 
radicalized in their 
dealings with the ad- 
ministration, yet the 
fault lies with the ad- 
ministration who stands 
in evidence of the fal- 
lacies that exist in 



our society between 
ideals and reality. I 
would hope that the ad- 
ministration would open 
its machine to those 
whom th®y serve — it 
would benefit every one 
involved.

BASEBALLI 
MARCH ?3 — i+p.m. 
WILDCAT T^IAMOOT) 



The I.S.A. which 
stands for Indiana Stu- 
dents Association, was 
started this year under 
the office of William 
Salin, Indiana Secretary 
of State. Their pur- 
pose is to unify all 
students in Indiana. 
They are organizing the 
Pollution Teach-in in 
Indiana, and are working 
on student rights and 
responsibilities, and 
student codes. 

These two organiza- 
tions were started and 
designed to help stu- 
dents on the campuses 
in Indiana. With stu- 
dent support and help 
they will make a go of 
it; without" it, like 
many other organiza- 
tions, they will wallow 
in a pool called ^3athy. 
If you would like more 
information on these 
organizations, or would 
like to attend the 
meetings get in touch 
with the Student Gov- 
ernment on your campus.
