"The idea of just silting, fishing or hun-

am looking-for something that would be 
worthwhile to someone besido myself." 

Broyles. who has been involved in 
education as a profession since 1941 when 
he began teachingchemistry 
at the I.U. Extern" 
Street, hopes to remain involved in the 
learning or teaching process. 

"I guess that if I were to put to work 
some of my skills and knowledge it would 
be related to education." 

"That does noi mean necessurily thai 
my plans are to return to the classroom. 
However, if the opportunity presented 
itself, I would have to consider leaching." 






He has seen the unprecedented 
experiment of cooperative operation with 
another university begin and thrive.

Nixon faces crisis: 

Meany, Nader 

speak out 



The worst crisis in the history of the 
United States presidency continued to 

public figures' advocated either the 
impeachment or the resignation of 
President Richard M. Nixon. 

George Meany, president of the A.F.L.- 
C.I.O., and consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader, appearing on separate televised 
interview programs on Sunday, 
September 2, had strong words 
concerning the Watergate affair, and 

Meany, appearing on the ABC 
program, "Issues and Answers", was 
asked his opinion of what should happen 
to the President if he refused to turn over 
the Watergate tapes if the Supreme Court 
so ordered he said: "Nixon should be 
impeached if he resists (he Supreme 
Court." 

He added. "If the Court says to turn the 
tapes over to Archie Cox, and Nixon 
would say, 'No, I won't do that... I'mabove 
the law,' then I think the only alternative is 
impeachment." 

Archibald Cox is the Special Prosecutor

Ralph Nader, champion of the nation's

Vending machines 

Service in Ihe new cafeteria in the Student Union is much improved over what it 
was last year. But there is one time when the service is not better than last year's, 
this being over the week-ends. 

In the past the cafeteria was always open over the weekends and other times 
when classes were not in session. People on campus had access to the vending 
machines for limited food service. 

It was not uncommon for there to be a number of students congregating in the 
cafeteria on Saturday afternoons or Sunday evenings, drinking coffee and takinga 
breather from studying. 

The vending machine area of hte cafeteria also found use during the evening ac- 
tivities, such as SUB concerts of PIT plays. Sunday evenings, the traditional 
meeting time of many student organizations, found especially heavy cafeteria 
utilization. 

This past weekend was a different case. The vending machine area of the 
cafeteria was closed even though there was a free concert in the Ball Room on 
Saturday night. 

The Union is not a Monday to l-nd.i\ building hcaust (his i .minus functions 
seven days a week. It is important that Union a tiiviUsand facilities be available to 
those who use the Building on weekends. 

The vending machine area and the southern half of the cafeteria should be open 
whenever the Union is open. This includes weekends, after nine at night, and 
between semesters. The people in charge of the Union should take action to keep 
these areas open. 

Lagoon Day 

The Johnson, Johnson, and Roy architechural study of a few years back 
depicted a beautiful campus centered on the paved mall that sits between the 
Student Union and the Library. The lagoon that lies west of this mall was to be 
dredged and maintained as a natural attraction. 

Money for the dredging ,ind restoration has not been lorth-cuniing. The Union 
project allocated no funds for this purpose, and Building D, an academic building 
to sit north of the lagoon, has been indefinably posl-poned. 

At this point in time, the natural splendor of the lagoon remains a receptacle for 
refuse and waste. Its beauty is not yet realized. 

The Students' Government is touching a multiphase project lo preserve and 
protect and the natural beauty ot i he campus I agouii Hay is the first phase of this 

Lagoon Day will bean attempt to clean up the trash, drift, and other waste that 
has depostied on the banks of the lagoon. No live vegitation will be cut or des- 
troyed. 

Lagoon Day is an admirable project for the Students' Government. The con- 
tribution of this project to the aesthetic beauty of the campus can be appreciated by 
all. 

What lies ahead of Lagoon Day? If Lagoon Day is the first phase of a multi- 
phase project, what will be phases two, three, etc.? Why was mid- 1975 picked as the 
end for the project? 

These questions need lo be asked, now and after Lagoon Day. It would be a 
tragedy if Lagoon Day was the start and the finish of the project.

Key 73 



Hard work and much time has been devoted to bring the Key 73 Crusade to the 
Fort Wayne area. Many churches have banded together in order for the program 
to work smoothly. 

Key 73 throwsaside ail denominational barriors and unites the Christians in one 
common goal - evangalism. The crusade has a definite principle behind it. The 
program is bnnging back the ideas of family ties through religion. It is giving the 
familysomething to hold it together. 

Key 73 allows people to find out if they have a definite belief. It will allow the in-

We Believe A Stereo System 

Should Sound Better At Home 

Than It Does On Paper. 

If you have $400-500 to put into a stereo system, there are lots of really 
good receivers and record players to choose from, but very few speakers that 
hold up their all-important end of the system. Which is why some systems 
wind up sounding less impressive at home than they did in the advertisement. 

We sell The Smaller Advent Loudspeaker because it turns this situation 
upside down. Not only do a pair of Smaller Advents sound as good as you 
(and we) had hoped, but well beyond unreasonable expectations. There is 
just nothing remotely like them. 

The Smaller Advents were designed to sound as good in every respect, 
including frequency bandwidth, as any speakere of anv price. Test reports in 
both High Fidelity and Stereo Review magazines agree that their response 
and overall performance would be noteworthy in anv speaker, regardless of 
size or cost. 

To understand just how much of a difference these speakers make in 
what you actually can hear for your money, come in and listen to the systems 
we ve built around a pair of them.

MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYOFFS UNFAIR 

In 1969 major league Kim.- kill wenl to divisional play. Al thai time, this writer 
was shocked to find thai there was no provision lor a wild card team in the Cham- 
pionship Series (ilie hesl-ol-five playoll between division winners todctcminc (he 
pennant winner and World Series participant). 

But in each of Ihc first lour years, the division winners in horn the Nalionaland 
American leagues were also the beu two learns in their leagues: the West and East 
divisons were evenly matched. On the surface, no flaw could be discerned in the 
playoff system. 

The 1973 season, (hough, has revealed the inevitable and mi I orgivablc defect in 
Ihc playoff procedure; the division winner in the NL East Division should be 
totally embarassed to appear in the playoffs. 

To clarify and prove my point. I have erased division lines and put the top teams 
of the National League together for a won-lost comparison. The standings as of 
Labor Day follow:

Yet there will be one plavofl representative I rum the NL East and only one from

Either Cincinnati or Los Angeles is in for a monumentally major disap- 
pointment: record-wise at this writing Ihey arc by far the best two teams in all of 
baseball. Yet one of the squads will not even make the playoffs because they 
happened to be in the same division as the other. 

Obviously this snuation is grossly unfair And the solution is blushingly simple: 
a wild card representative would join the division winners in the playoffs. 

This solution is not perfect, but it is the only realistic alternative toal least help

AFC WEST 



asked for political asylui 



Kansas City — If Len Dawson can have the kind of year he is capable of, the Chiefs 
and Hank Stram should win the divisional title. Last season the Chiefs managed 
only eight wins and failed to make the playoffs. Prediction: A healthy Dawson 
could put K.C. in the Super Bowl. 

Oakland — Daryl Lamonica (2nd best quarterback in the AFC) and Marv Hub- 
bard (3rd best rusher) are two reasons for the Raiders ten victories last year. Ques- 
tion: Will George Blanda ever retire? Prediction: Don't be surprised if the stan- 
dings are reversed. 

San Diego — San Diego should improve on its' 4-9-1 record with its "remodeled'' 
ball club. Johnny Unitas will be trying to prove that he's still young at heart. 
Prediction: Unitas will find out how it feels to play for a loser. 
Denver — The best player on the team is Floyd Little who gained only 859 yards. 
Although they were 4th in both team offense and defense, they could manage only 
five wins last year. Prediction: The Broncos have the potential to upset a few of the 
leaders, but a playoff berth is years away. 

AFC CENTRAL 

Pittsburgh — The Stcelers were the surprise learn last winning eleven games. The 
defense was the key with such stars as Mean Joe Greene and Jack Ham. Offen- 
sively, the Steelers were led by last year's AFC Rookie of the Year, Franco Harris. 
Prediction: First in the Central division and possibly first in the AFC. 
Cleveland — Last year's wildcard team with a 10-4 record, the Browns are led by 
Leroy Kelly and ex-Purdue Q.B. Mike Phipps. Prediction: Maybe the wildcard 
team again, but watch out for the Bengals. 

Cinncinati — The Bengals had the 2nd best team defense in the league last year 
under head coach Paul Brown. Tommy Casonova andLamar Parrish make the 
secondary strong. Prediction: Might be an upset winner 

Houston — The Oilers could manage only one victory last season and scored a 
conference low of 164 points. The Oilers will just have to look to the future. Predic- 
tion: The Oilers will come alive in 1985? 

AFC EAST 

Miami — The Dolphines won seventeen straight games last season and are the 

reigning world champions. Last year the Dolphins led in almost every offensive 

and defensive category with the help of such stars as BobGnese. Mercury Morris, 

Doug Swift, and Larry Csonka, just to name a few. Prediction: The start of a 

dynasty. 

New Yrok — Joe Willie Namath is the Key figure to the Jet attack. A healthy 

Namath and the Jets might win ten games. Prediction: No chance to catch the Jets, 

but a playoff berth isn't impossible. 

Baltimore — The Colts are in a rebuilding stage alter trading away such stars as 

Johnny Unitas, Tom Matte, and Bubba Smith. L.S.U. star Bert Jones will be the 

key to a winning season. Prediction: Baltimore in 74*? 

Buffalo — When you think of the Bills you think of O.J. Simpson. Simpson was 

the leading rusher in the NFL last year with 1251 yards. Prediction: Too bad talent 

like O.J.'s is wasted on a mediocre club. 

New England — Jim Plunked is due to become a star, but, even if he does, the Pats 

would be lucky to climb out of last place. Last in team defense and 12th in offense 

are the reasons the Patriots won only three games lasl year. Prediction: Celler 

Dweller.
