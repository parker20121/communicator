'Abortion 
ad' sparks 
controversy 



By Ramonu Mcgown 
Managing Editor 

On Oct. 18, Student Body 
President Mark King prcsenicd a 
leilcr requesting ihat the policy of 
adveriising in The Communicaior 
be reviewed because of a recent stu- 
dent complaint 

IPFW sophomore Kim Cast pre- 
sented a formal complaint to stu- 



dent government. Cast slated that 
she was "concerned and upset about 
an ad running concerning the issue 
of abortion." 

"The wording of the ad was 
poorly done. Ullimaiely, I would 
not like the ad to be advertised in 
the paper," said Gast. 

The Communicator contacted 
King about the issue. 

"Yes, I did write the letter and 
totally agree with it," said King. 

When asked if the student gov- 
ernment as a whole had been con- 
tacted and consulted about the let- 
ter, he added, "I did consult my 
executive board, which includes 
Mike Heil, El^e Linder and Amy 
Steenman," said King. 

Vice President of Legislation 



Amy Steenman staled to The 
Communicator that she was aware 
of a letter. 

"I db not know exactly what is 
contained in the letter, but I am 
aware that it is about an ad." said 



"I just read the letter and I 
emphatically agree with everydiing 
that is written in the letter," said 

Steenman. 

King also suggested in the letter 
that Gasi's complaint was reprcscn-

advei^ising of abortion is not a 

proper or necessary type of advertisement 

to be included in a college newspaper."

Alcohol Sc Safety 
Awareness Week 
draws to a close 



byNolT,Beckley 
Staff Writer 

Alcohol and Safety Awareness 
Week began Monday, Oct. 17, with 
the motto, "This week could save 
your life," said Chief of University 
Police Lauren DenHanog, 

The purpose of Awareness 
Week was to help "make yourself 
and the campus safe," DenHartog 
added. 

Most of die information booths 
in Kcltler ihat corresponded to the 
event were sponsored by the 
FWPD. A demonstration of the use 
of police dogs in apprehension and 
detection of drugs during a police 
investigation was one of the high- 
hgbts of the week as was a realistic 
mock accident and mock trial. 

Assisting with the accident were 
the FWPD and Parkview Hospital's 
'Samaritan' helicopter. Also donat- 
ing lime and manpower were Allen 
County Towing, Allen Couniy 
Sheriff's Department and Mercy 
Ambulance Service, said 
DenHariog, 

DenHartog also cited Ron 
Bregin of the Society of Auto 
Engineers, IPSGA, and SAB as 
major contributors to the mock 
accident and subsequent trial. 



Amy Steenman, IPSGA vice 
president of Legislation and orga- 
nizer of the mock trial, said, "We 
basically wanted to send out a mes- 
sage that drunk drivers should,, .be 
punished for it." 

During Awareness Week, 
IPFWs HIV/AIDS Information 
Committee, in coordination with 
Fort Wayne-Allen County 
Department of Health, sponsored 
free HlV/AlDS testing Monday and 
Thursday of last week. 

Fon Wayne Police Department 
Officer Bill Atkinson, along with 
associate instructor Rebecca Wolf 
held a self-defense seminar on 
Thursday, OcL 20 cntided Personal 
Safety for the 90's, Both will return 
to campus before Christmas break 
to funher instruct people about self- 
defense, 

The week's activities were fund- 
ed by McDonald's Corp.. said 
DenHanog. 

DenHartog also mentioned ihe 
contributions of the Center for 
Women and Returning Adults and 
die Human Services Depanmeni. 

Alcohol and Safety Awareness 
Week was not a pari of any national 
safety program; it is solely an IPFW 
production, according to 
DenHartog.

iroversial adveriising that would 
illicite [sic] such a strong emotion 
from the student population at 
large." said King, 

King also suggested diat student 
government as a collective entity 
does not agree with the advertising 
of abortion. 

King said, "it is the policy of this 
government that the advertising of 
aboruon is not a proper or necessary 
type of advenisemcnl to be includ- 
ed in a college new,spaper." 

The ad that appears in The 
Communicator also appears in the 
Ball State Daily News, as well as 
the lUPUI Sagamore, 

Chris Douse. IPSGA liaison to 
The Communicator, was asked if he 
was aware of the letter distributed 



by King. 

"As Ihe liaison of The 
Communicator, I had to find out 
about the letter through another 
source. I would think that King 
would have conuictcd mc first. King 
is really leaning toward a content 
issue, and as a student government 
member I do not diink that this is a 
good idea," said Douse. 

Linda Fox. associate professor of 
Spanish, felt that King's actions 
were once again remiss in diought. 

"Students must be informed of 
all allemaiives and types of services 
available to them, if one side is 
advertised, such as the Crisis 
Pregnancy ad, then the other side 
must be represented as well." said 
Fon, 



Chief Justice backs 
voter registration effort 



By S. Brant Kelley 
News Writer 

In the Ocl, 24 student senate 
meeting. IPSGA Judicial 
Court Chief Justice Jerry 
Richardson talked about 
Register Once, a project to 
make voting registration more 
accessible to college students. 

Richardson said about 20 
percent of all college students 
have voted since the 21si 
amendment was passed in 
1973, which allowed people 
ages 18 to 21 lo vole. In the 
last election, about 40 percent 
of college-age adults voted, he 
said. 

The present voting system 
presents problems for the col- 
lege student, according to 
Richardson. Since students 
often reside on or near a col- 
lege campus but are required 
to vote in Ihe dislrict of their 
permanent residence, many 
can't vote on campus. Many 
large college campuses are 
also divided into several dis- 
tricts "for city council purpos- 
es," according to Richardson. 

Richardson stated that the 
program has four goals: 

• Allow students to register to 
vote while registering for 
classes; 

• Allow students to request, 
receive and deposit their 
absentee ballots on campus; 

• Install polling stations on

On Thursday. Oct. 20. 
Sergeant Bill Atkinson, direc- 
tor of the Fort Wayne Police 
Athletic League, and associate 
instructor Rebecca Wolf, gave 
a seminar titled "Self-Defense 
in the 90s" at the Milliard 
Gales Athletic Center. 

Atkinson and Wolf demon- 
strated how a person could 
disarm an assailant so the vic- 
tim could escape without 
harm. 

A person's body language 
can have a lot to do with 
whether an attacker will 
choose him or her as a victim. 



Atkinson said. People who 
appear to be alert and aware of 
their surroundings are less 
likely to become victims than 
people who are just watching 
the ground in front of them. 



The instructors emphasized, 
that if someone is being fol- 
lowed, that person should 
absolutely not go home. He or 
she should go to places where 
there are many people, and if 



^'The quicker you can react to an 
attacker^ the better your chances 

are for survival..." 
- Sergeant Bill Atkinson, FWPD 



"You should be aware of 
the people around you when 
going to and from your car 
and your home, and an attack- 
er will probably not be some 
extremely large and rough- 
looking individual." said 
Wolf. 



he or she is attacked by an 
assailant, make as much noise 
as possible to attract attention. 
"The quicker you can react 
to an attacker, the better your 
chances are for survival, and if 
a person is still alive within 
the first two to five seconds of 



every campus with two hun- 
dred or more resident students; 
and, 

• Install campus-based voting 
for all students. This would 
allow every student who is 
registered in the university's 
county to vote at the campus, 
no matter where his or her 
precinct is. 

If a student used an absen- 
tee ballot, the student would 
fill out the ballot and sign a 
form stating he or she would 
not vote in his or her precinct 
later on voting day. The penal- 
ty for voting twice in the same 
election is stiff, said 
Richardson. He said the penal- 
ty was lo "maintain the sancti- 
ty of the voting process." 

He said next steps are to 
proceed in four steps: 
send out advertisements for 
registered voters to vole on 
Nov. 8; 

gel students on the 350 college 
campuses to fill out petitions 
to enact Register Once; send 
the petitions to the legislators 
of Ihe districts where the vari- 
ous colleges are located; and, 
direct lobbying to get legisla- 
tors to act on Register Once. 

Richardson and Steenman 
wrote a resolution for IPSGA 
to discuss during their next 
senate meeting on Nov. 7. He 
said it was an "endorsement of 
us [IPSGA) working on this 
program," 



being attacked his or her 
chance of survival is greatly 
increased." said Atkinson. 

Wolf and Atkinson both 
said that they do not condone 
the use of weapons to defend 
oneself. They said most 
assaults that occur with 
weapons end up being the vic- 
tim's own weapon. The best 
defense against an attacker is 
to be alert and aware of what 
is around, in order to avoid 
becoming a target in the first 
place. 

Atkinson and Wolf said 
they hope to return to IPFW 
before the holiday break in 
order lo give another seminar 
on self defense.

The Communicator 

Takes action without thinking 



Staff Editorial 



Do ihe words "Firsl 
Amendment" mean anything to our 
student body president? Evidently 
noi. Yet again without thinking, 
King ha.s taken ii upon himself to 
act on behalf of the student body 
without iLs input, and without input 
from the student governing body: 
This time. King has decided to sup- 
pon one student in trying to ban an 
ad that "has a tontroversial over- 
tone." 

In his letter to The 
Communicator publications board. 
King goes on to suggest that student 
government as an entity agrees and 
has concluded that The 
Communicator should look at its 
policy toward this type of advertis- 
ing. 

Does the word "censorship" 
mean anything to you. Mr. King? 
Have you forgotten that you no 
longer represent only your individ- 
ual views, but those of 12,000 oth- 
ers? Have you forgotten whose 
money you are playing with the.se 



days? Above all, Mr. King, have 
you forgotten whom you work for? 
Student government has no place 
in setting policy for its student 
newspaper. Maybe Mr. King is sug- 
gesting that student government 

Have you forgotten that 

you no longer represent 

only your individual 

views, but those of 12,000 
others? Have you forgot- 
ten whose money you are 
playing with these days? 

Above all, Mr. King, have 

you forgotten whom you 

work for? 

should control the student newspa- 
per. Now as president of the IPFW 
student body, is this really prudent 
behavior? 

Thc-Studcnubody should be 
made aware that it^ student body 



president feels as though any ads of 
a controversial nature matter should 
be removed from the paper 

It The Communicator were to 
succumb to the pressure of student 
government regarding the content 
of the paper, we would be doing a 
disservice to all students on cam- 
puses everywhere. Wc would, in 
short, be acting against journalism 
ethics. 

In other words, if King does not 
believe in a petition, then he appar- 
ently feels no one else should 
believe in it, either student govern- 
ment members or the students of 
IPFW. 

The Firsl Amendment protects 
everyone's rights to free speech, not 
the rights of only those with whom 
you happen to agree. 

The next lime you sit down to 
write a letter, you might want to 
think deeply about who you are rep- 
resenting, whether or not you have 
their consensus and what you ^c 
actually saying.

Commentary 
Africans in world history 



By Ramona Mcgown 
Managing Editor 

John Clarke, author of 
"African People in World 
History." clarifies how African 
people play a crucial role in world 
history. 

"In most Western textbooks. 
the history of Africa and its peo- 
ple is approached as if Africans 
had no history worth recording 
before the Europeans contacted 
them," Clarke wrote. 

It is quite unfonunale that in 
the year 1994, world liistory still 
excludes and exploits the global 
and national contributions by 
Africans and African-Americans. 

These contributions were and 
aie in no w^y.tninuio. In fact, if 
one took a true look at history, at 
the accomplishments, discoveries 
and inventions that Africans and 
African- Americans contributed to 
worid history, it would appear 
that in fact without African histo- 
ry, world history would lack sig- 
nificance. 

An ironic scenario that exists 
in the United States is that many 
young school children as well as 
young adults are taught the very 
opposite. Most of their history 
textbooks incorporate little or 
almost no history of Africans and 
African -Americans, 

According to Martin Dernal, 
author of "Black Athena", "it is 
commonly supposed that the 
Hermetic Texts were discredited 
in I6I4 by the great scholar Isaac 
Casaubon, who showed to his sat- 
isfaction that the Texts did not 
come from deepest Antiquity but 
were post-Christian. This view 
has been accepted as axiomatic 
since the 19th century, even by 
rebel scholars such as Frances 
Yates. However. 1 try to show 
why I am inclined to the view put 
forward by Ihe Egyptologist Sir 
Flinders Petrie that the earliest 
Texts dale back to the 5lh century 
B.C." 



In "Black Athena." Bernal 

explains how, even as early as the 
19lh century, texts were already 
being distorted and the distribu- 
tion of misinformation had 
already begun. 

Bemal intensely examines the 
study of classical civilization. In 
doing so, he is convinced that 
Afroasialic influences have pur- 
posely been depleted from worid 
history due to racist motives. 

The idea of racist motives can 
be seen through the portrayal of 
the history of Egypt. Most indi- 
viduals in the United Stales have 
accepted the fact that Egypt is 
now considered part of the 
Middle East. 

Clarke stated. "Egypt is the 
key to ancient African history. 
Unless Egypt is seen as an 
African nation, African history 
becomes disioned. The bulk of 
the Arab population in present 
day Egypt has no direct relation- 
ship to ancient Egyptian history." 

The fact thai Egypt is northern 
Africa is completely ignored and 
even denied by .some historians. 

Even though some scholars 
will admit that Egypt is in north- 
ern Africa, most still argue that 
Egyptians were people of color 
but not necessarily African. 

Clarke argues, however,""The 
ancient Egyptians were distinctly 
African people. They were not 
Hamiles as some history books 
lend to indicate." 

Another example of how histo- 
ry has been distorted by 
Europeans lies in the fact that 
Africans were discredited by text- 
books which characterize them as 
uncivilized and inhuman savages. 

Clarke gives another explicit 
description of how this was done: 

'The tragic and distinguishing 
feature of the slave u^ade thai was 
introduced by Europeans was that 
it sought to dehumanize the slave. 
This dehumanizalion effort con- 
tinued in many ways throughout 
the slavery period and well into 



the colonial era. This policy was 
given crucial support in part by 
the Christian church and was later 
extended by the writers of the 
seventeenth and eighteenth cen- 
turies. The myth that Africans 
had no history or culture comes 
out of this period." 

Therefore, people who were 
described as inhuman and sav- 
ages of course could not have 
been queens and kings, or inven- 
tors of medicine and science. 

The desire to maintain and 
support a selective memory of 
world history is supported by 
many in acadetnia who use politi- 
cal words like "revisionism." 

These admonishments are used 
to invalidate any information that 
contradicts the status quo of 
beliefs and ideas in world history. 

The fact remains that this type 
of behavior continues today and 
still is used in some instancesto 
keep African-Americans docile 
and unaware of their heritage. 

If a people does not know what 
its true history is, and it accepts a 
religion or history in which as a 
race it is not included, subcon- 
sciously or consciously that body 
of people feels inferior and main- 
tains a low self-esteem. 

If you can keep a group of peo- 
ple in the dark about its heritage 
and history, then you can control 
how it feels about itself, its self- 
worth, intelligence, and to some 
extent, its abilities to grow and 
learn. 

A vicious cycle of self-hate 
and self-destruclion will continue 
unless African-Americans take 
initiatives to change the situation. 

One way to help solve the 
problem of world history would 
be to build schools in the neigh- 
borhoods. African-Americans 
may not be able to control how 
world history is taught on a glob- 
al level, but they can control how 
world history is taught in their 
communities.

Cross and it tests 
positive for HIV? 

A: The Red Cross notifies, 
by registered letter, donors 
whose blood tests positive 
for HIV or other STDs. It is a 
felony in Indiana to 
knowingly donate blood 
containing HIV, so if you 
suspect you have HiV 
infection, you should not 
donate blood. You should 
be tested at the Board of 
Health or by your physician.

Soccer team

TTie IPFW Men's Soccer (earn 
played (wo matclies Ihts past 
weekend and came up empty twiii 
limes. 

On Saturday, agalnsi Northern 
Kentuclcy University. IPFW fell 
by a score of 3-0. The matcii on 
Sunday against I-ewis University 
saw tlie IPFW team lose 7-1 due 
lo three sianers not playing in Ihc 
game, Ben Trevino, IPFWs 
stalling stopper all year, was out 
with Ihe flu. Adnm Green, the 
starling midfielder, and Greg 
Haney. tlie starling fullback, were 
absent because in the last game 
played they both received Iheir 
fifth yellow card. This results in a 
one-game suspension for the 
players. 

Although Ihe soccer team has 
suffered through a very frustrat- 
ing season, there have been a lol 
of bright spots to build on for 
next year. Mike Harper has been a 
good field leader for the team and 
is the leading scorer in the confer- 
ence this year. Den Trevino has 
been a devastating force on the 
defensive end of the field all year, 
and Brian Hayes played like a 
wild animal on a mission. 

IPFWs last regular season 
game is next Sunday against 
Finley University. The team 
would like to fmish the season on 
a positive note so thai it can build 
on next year.

close match but couldn't quite match

Andi Rcichhail played very well and 
racked up over a ,600 hilling percent- 
age. Heffron said the women produced 
their best selling of the year against 
Michigan, and the overall play was 
good. IPFW won all Ihc long rallys in 
Ihe match, and Heffron believes Ihis 



was good for Itic future of the learn.

that the team needed mote consistency

Haunted Castle tour includes 
catwalks, paths, mazes, slides 



2Auc« 



tic^u- ^«as«^^,^,X« 



By Kura Whiling 
Features Editor 

Well boys and girls, ladies and 
gcnilcmcn, (his year's Haunted 
Casile opened its doors once again 
for ihc public 10 experience some 
scary siufr. Qui instead of jusi 
going through like a regular per- 
son, I decided to take a peek 
behind the coffins and see what 
goes on before the doors open to 
Ihc public. 

I began my tour with castle 
coordinalor Randy Young who 
look me through the casUc widi all 
of the lights on. He showed me the 
catwalks dial are above die actual 
mazes that people go through. This 
was interesting because all of iJic 
woodwork ijjat went into building 
not only the catwalks, but also die 
paths and mazes, was handmade 
by volunteers of the Si. Vincent 
Seoul's Troop. 

While you are louring die casUc, 
"catwalk security" are watching 
you to make sure everything goes 
all right. After knowing diis 1 felt 
better about going dirough diis cas- 
de on my own. 

After talldng widi many individ- 
uals affiliated with the develop- 
ment of the castle, [ began to see

that a lot of hard work goes into 
this project. Over 130 people arc 
needed per night &lt;o make sure 
everything goes smoothly. The 
ages of the volunteers arc usually 
between 18 and 65. However, 
according to Julie Young, wife of 
coordinator Randy Young, "If any 
younger kids come, a parent must 
be widi them!" 

After a while, 1 began to gel to 
know my way around the castle 
pretty well. But then 1 took a 
wrong mm and saw the new slide 
dial is about 65 feet long and takes 
only 12-16 seconds to go down. 



Many of the scouts were "testing" 
it out before the crowds poured 
into die casde. 

The slide is just one of the new 
attractions at the castle this year. 
"People were asking for somediing 
different, so we talked to Disney 
World for lips and ideas," said vol- 
unteer George Bachinsky. These 
tips and ideas became a reality this 
year widi ihe addition of an exlrav- 
agani-looking gorilla and two 
mechanical dinosaurs that do look 
like something out of Jurassic Park. 

These new additions were 
financed very carefully. Only a por- 



tion of the earnings go 10 supplies 
and additions. "The rest of the 
money goes to the boys' and girls' 
accounts that pay for trips, uni- 
forms, registration for units and 
necessary running elements," said 
Bachinsky. 

Knowing all of this infoimaiion 
before touring the casde with the 
ghosts and witches in place. I truly 
was impressed with the thought, 
determination and hard work that 
went to making this year's Haunted 
Castle. After touring the casde, 1 
can say that it is worth going to see 
if you havcn'l already. 



IPFW offers HIV testing 



By Paul TupptT 
Staff Writer 

Veronica George, freshmon. 
awaits her turn outside Kciilcr GS4, 
where she is about to be icsled for Ihc 
HIV virus. She is naturally nervous 
because she has acted "foolish" this 
past year by allowing a former 
boyrricnd to have scxual'iintcrcdursp 
with her wiihout using a c'ctidomVAt 
23. she knows ihe risk ihai such acdv- 
iiy has. An anonymous friend Is wilh 
VeroDica; she loo has allowed herself 
to have unprotccicd sex and is ready 
ro be tested as a "precaution," When 
asked why she agreed to unprotecied 
sex, the 23-year-old freshman said 
ihal she "was caughi up in the 
moment." Now she agrees that "noth- 
ing is more romantic than lo have a 
lover insist on wearing a condom" 

These iwo African-American 
women arc not alone. Also waiting to 
be tested for the HIV virus is a white, 
gay male, who has been tested many 
times before, but is here because "it's 
been awhile" and he would like to say 
lo his lover that the tests arc still neg- 
adve. 

The test diat these three are taking 
will not tell them if Ihey have AIDS, 
the fatal disease linked to HIV. There 
currenily is not a test available. But 
the participants here know that any- 
one who has died from AIDS or 



AIDS-rclaled illnesses have been c 
ricrs of the HIV virus. So it's not 
something that anyone wishes to con- 
Elizabeth Larrabee is Ihe coun- 
selor who was at IPFW. taking Ihe 
blood from students to be tested. It is 
her Job lo educate those who are 
being tested as to what Iheir options 
ate, what will happ'cii to ihcir test| 
results and exacily whlil Ihey are "get-' 
ting themselves into. Part of thai 
princess includes: 

1. calculating an accurate risk 
assessment to sec if the client 

has a little to fear, or a lot to fear, 

2. determining if the client would 
want lo reveal Iheir name in confi- 



dence or use anonymity. The advan- 
tage to revealing a name is that there 
is more money available for medical 
care for those who reveal their names. 

3. take a blood sample lo be test- 
ed and schedule a lime in which lo 
receive the test results two weeks 
later. 

Being posilive does not mean that 
life will end in Ihe near fulurc. Some 
people wilh HIV have gone on to live 
20 years before losing Ihc battle. 
Larrabee says that taking good care of 
your body and eating healthy will 
help prolong the deteriorating 
process. 

Many may not know that active 
sex lives are slill possible for those 



who lest positive. The gay student in 
line says it best, "If my partner tested 
posilive, it would not make a differ- 

If you would like to be tested but 
missed the opportunity this time, free 
tests are always available courtesy of 
the Fort Wayne/Allen County Board 
of Health. Telephone 428-7504 for
