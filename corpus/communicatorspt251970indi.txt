Dr. B. D. Erdlman of Indi-

as the lecturer. He outlined 
student and university life 
in Europe, particularly the 
University ol Oslo, which 
he uttended as a graduate 
student from 1962 to 1965. 
In short, Norway has a 

tern. The point of view in 
Norway is that higher edu-

minimum salary, also, far 
housing and food, which 
are supplied very cheaply 
on campus. There are 
sauna baths, kindergartens 
lor students' children, and 
a very wide variety of ath- 
letic activities. The most 
popular sport is skiing, 
which is understandable be- 
cause the University of Oslo 
is located in a range of 
beautiful, snowy mountains. 
The Student Union, 
which Dr. Erdtman was a 
member of, is actually a 
student parliament com- 
pascd of various political, 
student, and departmental 
study groups, ft consists 
of one third students, one 
third tenured professors, 
and one third assistant 
professors. 

There are no radical 
power struggles within the 
Student Union. It only 
takes on (usually) personal 
problems between students 
and faculty. It talks any 
other situations over ra-

Mr. Byrd has 
conceivable ovalii 
award in the field of music 
and has played at Newport, 
Monterey, Concord and other 
pop festivals. He was one of 
sixteen people to be awarded 
a master degree under Seg- 
ovis. This fact in itself, even 
if he had gone into appearing 
publically, would prove lhat 
Mr. Byrd is indeed the best 
in the business. He started 
out in the jazz Field only.hcw- 
ever and then gradually broad- 
ened his playing styles until 
he reached an nil encompas- 
sing skill at virtually anv tvpe 
of guitar imaginable. It is be- 
cause of this ability lo play 
anything, that he and his group 

several different ways. The 
symphony aspect of his ac- 
claim has taken in such 
places as Washington Nation- 
al, Ballimore.Minnesota, York 
and Shenandoah conserva- 
tory's. The group was al- 

cullural tour For the United 
States State Department. At 
present, the Blood Sweat &amp; 
Tears group is acting as 

campuses has proved lo be 
most rewarding, because a 
majority of the colleges have 
requested return performances 
of Ihc group and some have 
asked For as many as 5 or 6 
repeal showings. Incidentally, 
since Sepf. 15, they have done 
8 shows and have -18 to do be- 
fore Christmas. 

Some of Mr. Byrd's ac- 
complishments are introducing 
Ihc Boss Nova to the U.S., 
and recording 40 albums. Be 
taught music at American U- 
niversity and composed o 
score for a rock comedy pro- 
duced by Greicher Wyler and 
Paul Aaron. 

His group is comprised 
of perfectionists, however, 
they do not practice much. Mr. 
Byrd stated humbly that "We 
don't practice, we just play 
alot." 

Mr. Byrd plans a basic 

format for his shows but docs 

it plan the songs themselves 

;cause it crumps his style 

id makes it more difficult 

for him to perform. 

(believe Mr. Byrd'sta- 
'nt about not practicing.

The Consequence 
of Student Power 



6 V Scott Gillie 

When the cry For student 
participation, student voice 
in the decision-making pro- 
cess, or student power is 

sponse is to be negative. 
Most people feel that too 
much power is already non- 
negotiable policy in the hands 
of the administration. That is, 
most people sec the need For 



les; 



let 



power concentrated anywhere 
in the university.lt is not the 
the fear of students in power 
that constrains many indivi- 
duals f^m involving them- 
selves in the student cause 
hut the legitimate Fear of a 
concentration of power itself 
no matter who be the holder 
of that power. 

Less total power would 
allow more freedom in the uni- 
versity from which every mem- 
ber of the university commu- 
nity-would benefit. 

Student involvement is 
the only way to diminish the 
total amount of power, author- 
ity, now concentrated in a 
single branch of the univer- 
sity trichotomy, the admini- 



stration. For by distributing 
power in the university, the 

amount of exclusive control 



of 



,-ilhor 



sub- 



would be dim 
stantially. 

Student power is, at this 
time, the only rational ap- 
proach toward redistribution 
oE authority in ihe univer- 
sity. To ask the faculty to 
risk their few hard won 

sent political climate, is to 
ask the overwhelming major- 
ity who sympathize with stu- 
dents (having been students 
themselves) to martyr them- 
selves. Realistically, the 
student has the least to lose 
in seeking redistribution of 
authority in the university. 

Thus the student must see 
lhat he is responsible not 



it Ihc 



.the 



of the Faculty and the univer- 
sity itself. The consequence 
of student power musl be a 
reduction of the total amount 
of power resulting in meaning- 
ful participation in the univer- 
sity for every member of the 
ity.

LOT 

BURG- 
LARY 

by Steve Franks 

Sometime around 11:00 

o'clock, p.m., September 23, 
Paul Pratico, student senator, 
had his car burglarized and 
vandalized as it sat in the 
unlit free parking lot. 

The thieves took 15 stereo 
tapes, a bagful of books, his 
wallet, bis gearshift knob, 
bis interior light bulb, and a 
set of clothes. 

They broke into his Cor- 

to get to the door handle. In 
the process they bent hi 
antenna to a horizontal pos 
tion. Papers from the glov 
comportment were slreivn o 
the floor of the car. 

When Paul came back I 
the building, the thit 
dently came buck to 




ivcrsary. 

,The four days of programing 
consisted mainly of workshop 
and lectures from leading con- 
servatives. Guest speakers in- 
cluded Senator Borry Gold- 
water; William F. Buckley, 




Make me an instrument of Your Peace. 
Where there is hatred let me sow love; 
Where there is injury pardon; 
Where there is doubt, faith; 
Where there is despair, hope; 
Where there is darkness, light; and 
Where there is sadness, joy. 

Divine Master, 
Grant that I may not so much 
Seek to be consoled as to console; 
To be understood as to understand; 
To be loved as to love; 
For it is in giving that we receive; 
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and 
It is in dying thai we are born to eternal life.
