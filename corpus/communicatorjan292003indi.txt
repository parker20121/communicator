IPFW hosts Future Cities Regional Competition 



What do you get when you 
mix middle school students and 
a bunch of recycled materials? 
Usuallya big mess and someone 
gelling grounded. 

This was not the case on 
Saturday. [|*FW hosted the 2003 
Future Cities Regional 

Competition. 

Forty-two teams of middle 
school students, teachers and 
mentors from all over Northern 
Indiana as well as Indian. ipoli- 
created futuristic Cities that deal! 



with the problems of pollution, 
crime, unemployment and other 
problems that real cities face. 

Director of Outreach 
Activities Carol Dostal 
explained "They slart in 
September and they form teams. 
A learn is three students, one 
teacher and one engineer. They 
do five things. 

"The first thing they do is 
go on SimCity software and 
design a city so they kind of 
leam what are the parts or neces- 
sary element: of a city They lum

Next students were 
presented with a problem 
they had to solve. This years 

Sroblom was biotechnology

word essay in which they 
explained how they would 
resolve this issue by using bio- 
engineering technology.

"The next thing is 
they build these models 
which have certain 
dimensions thev have to

city, but they are 
allowed to embellish il 
and make it futuristic. 

"They bring those 
models here and do a 5-

Student volunteers needed for STARs 



The IPFW Student t 
Representatives (STARs) are currently recruiting 
student volunteers who want to help foster excite- 
ment and pride in IPFW while having fun and 
meeling new people STAK-- help to provide pub- 
lic relations for the Office of Admissions as well as 
supporting Alumni Relations and other campus 



. assistant director of 
IPFW Admissions and founder of STARs, noted 
that the w'ork study positions were difficult lo fill 
and remembered the fun she had participating as 
an ambassador while an undergraduate student 
at Penn Slate University. 

"I had much pride and excitement for this 
new opportunity to create an organization which 
would encompass the enthusiasm shared by the 
IPFW community," said Ziegler. 1 felt strongly 
that there were IPFW students that would be 
eager to share their success with new students." 

STARs participate in a variety of activities on 
campus including guided lours, phonc-a-lhons 
with new or prospective students, campus open 
houses and student panel 1 - through the Office of 
Admissions. New this year is the Admissions chat 
room where prospective students can chat live 
online with a STAR lo ask questions or seek 
advice about IPFW. 

STARs also asusls &gt;-. itli activities and events 
like State House Day with Alumni Relations and 
the Omnibus Lecture Series with University 
Relations. Monthly STARs member meetings arc 
held on campus to coordinate efforts. 

Due to the scope of STARs activities, student 
members are offered a chance to network with 



many departments, faculty and current and 
prospective students, all while having a good 
lime. Mandie Pierce, current STAR, noted that her 
favorite part of her involvement in STARs is "a 
three way tie: meeting new people who are looking 
at going to IPFW, making connections with people 
all over campus and working with a goofy, fun 
bunch of people." 

Pierce notes that she got involved as a freshman 
student. "I wanted to get involved on campus... 
without a lot of time c6mmilments and doing 
something fun and interesting, but yet helping 
people out." 

For students h-nkim: lo participate in campus 
activities, Ziegler notes that STARs has many 
advantages. "This is a great opportunity for lead- 
ership experiences, to really share with the IPFW 
community and visitors your pride for being a 
Mastodon," said Ziegler. 'Meet new friends, 
colleagues and staff and make IPFW your home 
away from home." 

Students interested m [inning STARs must 
meet the standards ol eligibility Members must 
be current undergraduate students in good standing 
according to unn-ersitv policies with a minimum 
GPA of 25. Prospective members must complete 
an application and participate in an interview 
process. 

According to Ziegler, there are many plans 
for the future of the STARs organization as a result 
of changes at IPFW like the rise in traditional student 
population, student housing and the move to 
Division I status. "IPFW s future is impacting the 
community, and as we grow, STARs will be front 
and center as new students are welcomed to the 
campus and begin their academic careers." 

Students interested in being a STAR or learning 
more about the organization should contact Laura 
Ziegler in Admissions at J81-6954 or via e-mail at

American Chemical Society hopes to boost 
minority participation in sciences 



African Americans, His- 
panics and Native Americans 
pursuing undergraduate 
degrees in a myriad of sci- 
ence disciplines are eligible 
for scholarships through the 
American Chemical Society. 

According to the ACS. the 
scholars program is open to 
those studying chemistry, chem-

Likewise, African Americans, 
about 12 percent of the population, 
have less than two percent of

Students' learning transcends Indiana borders with NSE 

Participants have opportunity to live and study at one of almost 170 institutions without paying additional tuition 



Thai's because Markloy is 
Currently studying at Florida 
International University, in 
Miami. "Ifs been cold. It has 
been down lo 65 degrees," he 
laughed. 

While other IPFW students 
are bracing against this winter, 
Markley — who grew up in 
Northeast Indiana — is experi- 
encing life far from it — in terms 
of both wind chill factor and 
culture. 

"You feel like you're not 
even in the US. ThedivorsaU is 
so great. My roommate is from 
the Cayman Islands Mv friend- 
upstairs are from Jamaica ! have 
friends from all over; Seattle, 
ILillimure. New Jersey, Idaho," 
he explained. That is one thing 
that really attracted me to 
Miami. 1 wanted a whole new 
experience," Markley added. 

Markley es participating in 
the National Student Exchange 



through IPFW. NSE it 

of about 170 institutions. In it, 
qualifying students are able to 
spend a semester or academic 
year attending another school, 
ivoiding out-of-state tuition 



the o 









You don't have the kids and 
mortgage and the cat and the 
dog. I would be really mad at 
myself if I hadn't done this," 
Markley said. 

He is among the nearly 300 
IPFW studenLs who have partic- 
ipated in the program since the 
university became involved in 
1975, according to IPFW NSE 
coordinator Laurie Herbrand. 

Every year, she said, about 
15 to 20 IPFW students study 
away from Fort Wayne, while a 
handful come lo IPFW, 
Herbrand explained. 

"Once we have residence 
halls, that'll change quite a bit," 



To qualify, a student has to 
be going to school full-time (12 
or more credit hours) at IPFW; 
have a cumulative overall grade 
point average of 2.5 or higher 
and have completed more than 
24 semester credit hours by the 
time the exchange begins NSE 
also suggests a sophomore or 
junior standing to participate 
and noles that an "exchange 
may not be within 30 credit 

hums unless uillege approval is 
granted.'' 

Students can go for a 
semester or full academic year. 



but financial aid and scholarships 
still apply, aside from 
work/study programs. 

Herb rand's philosophy is 
similar to MarkJey's beliefs. NSE 
is a chance for students to leam 
not just academics, but about life 
outside Indiana's borders. There 
are other positives as well. 

"Some of them benefit 
geographically. They see and 
experience a new part of the 
country they might have never 
gone to otherwise. Another benefit 



is to be able to tap into courses 
and programs we may not have 
here They can experience a 
different subject matter. Another 
benefit is expanding culturally 
into a new cultural environment 
lhat might be a stretching expe- 
rience for somebody," Herbrand 
said. 

Olher NSE participants 
have used it for a chance to live 
with family members they don't 
get to spend much time with 
Otherwise because of distance. 

Alor 
Miami c: . 
participants this year have gone 
to the University of Hawaii at 
Manoa, University of South 
Carolina, University of Virgin 
Islands at St. Thomas, Northern 
Arizona University, California 
State University at Hayward.

and Oklahoma Stale University. 

Herbrand laughed that 
romance has even sparked 
through the program. 

"A student from Oklahoma 
State came here a year ago 
because she knew someone here 
from childhood. She met a 
gentleman here, and he ended 
up going there this year so they 
could be together. They're getting 
married in March.' she said. 

However, finding a spouse 
probably shouldn't be the main 
motivation in getting involved 
with NSE. Many students go for 
the ability to take different 
courses in dilferent states, like 
Beginning Mountaineering at 
the University of Wyoming and 
Introduction to the Casino at the 
University of Nevada, Las 

"Colorado has ski classes. 
West Virginia has white-water 
rafting classes," Herbrand 

This semester, Markley is 
taking an FIU course in s-ulboatinc; 

B You gel full credit for it. 
It's a three-hour class. We go out 



on Coconut Grove and sail 
around South Beach. We loam 
how lo navigate. It's things like 
that thai we'd never have in 
Indiana," he related. 

Just three weeks into his 
stay. Markley is enjoying the 
culture shock After growing up 
in Indiana, he indicated he 
sought it. 

"I was expecting it. I was 
warning that,' Markley said. 

He's currently living in a 
donn which he said is comparable 
to his former Fort Wayne 
apartment in cost and larger in 

"It's worked out really 
well. It's on the seventh floor of 
a 10-floor tower. I look out to the 
west side of Miami. It's great." 

According lo Herbrand, lhe 
application deadline for the 
2003-200-1 academic year is Feb. 
28. She can be reached at Kettlcr

Mars &amp; Venus J Parking: No solution, just a big problem 



Venus Asks: How many of you have been 
viclims of the parking garage hit-and-run? 
Imagine this: You jus! finished the last class of 
your jam-packed day and you're nearly lo your 
, car when 0AM! A huge black mark stands out on 
your driver's side door, and you realize that 
you've been hit. 

There arc no vehicles around on which to 
blame the accident, but you can't imagine who 
would have the nerve to leave such a hideous 
marking on your car. You pull oul o( the garage 
and decide there's nothing you can do about it 
other than mope and cuss under your breath about 
the parking situation al IPFW. (Which personally, I 
fee] i^ a non-c &lt;is ling problem!) 

Here's the Ihing ... How on earth would the 
driver go about finding oul whose car he just hit? 
It's not like we have issued parking places or 



registered vehicles. So whal's a person to do? 

For all of you hit-and-runners. I suggest 
leaving a note on the person's car and letting them 
know what happened, along with a phone number 
the person may reach you at to discuss further 
actions to be taken. 

My only request is that you lake responsibility 
for your actions and leave a note. Dam cowards? 

Mars Answers: 1 actually agree with Venus 
that there is no parking problem at IPFW. There's 
a walking problem — nobody wants to. 

It is unfortunate to be the victim of a hit-and- 
run, so just consider yourself lucky if it's just your 
car that's injured. 

If you walk lo your car and see a ding, jusl get

Social inequality runs wild 



On Monday, Jan. 20, 
Americans celebrated Martin

national holiday. As Americans, 
we have come so far. A/ler 300 
years of slavery and over 100 
years of discrimination, we have 
finally made it 

We now celebrate the birth 
of an African American, a political 
and social activist. But what

much higher rate of violent

America's high rate of 
violent crime is a direct result of 
poverty, inequality and a lack of 
social support for poor 
Americans. Like I said earlier 
the current administration 
continues to reduce social

We have achieved integration,

percent certain that if you asked 
any African American about 
racial equality, you would hear 
stories lhat would shock and

has become a nation of paranoia. 
Anyone different is suspect.

you will find lhat racial inequality 
is alive and thriving in the 
Uniled Slates. It is time for a 
total overhaul of our political

ruly represented and heard.

"Well, aren't you nice?" so 1 let 
go and she walked right into it. 
Then she was pissed and 
thumped me. So that was sclf- 
delense I presume. 

Continuing on with more 
comparisons... If you like chicks 
to shave their legs and slay in 
shape, you're a sexist. If you 
don'l, you're unromanlic. 

If you Iry to slay in shape, 
dress nice and look sharp, then 
don'l, then 
you buy her 
iiuwers ur something pretly as a 
surprise, then you must be after 
something. If you don'l, then 
you're not thoughtful. If she has 
a headache, then she is tired. If 
you have a headache, then you 
don't love her anymore. 

If you're proud of your 
accomplishments, Ihen you are 
full ol yourself. If you're not that 
overachiever, then you have no 
ambition. If you want sex loo 
often, then you're oversexed. If 
you don't want it often enough, 
then you must have somebody 
on Ihe side. 

Men, hang it up. We can't 
win. It's a losing battle and all 
we can do is keep adoring them 
and loving Ihcm. After all, it's 
only natural.

Letter to the Editor: attendance 



The subject of classroom 
allondance is something to 
which I devote very little 
Ihoughl or concern, so finding 
an editorial dedicated to it was a 
little surprising Surely, this is 3 
trivial matter and not worthy ol 
ink? Alter reading the editorial. I 
realize that it is not trivia] at all, 
and thai it deserves yel more 

Your first argument against 
taking atlcndancc has a few 
pruhlfins iviih both the law and 
with ethics. As I understand it, it 
aid office but 



the feder 



thai 



s that students 
aid also altend class. 1 believe 
thai another federal law gives 
Students receiving aid the ni;hl 
lobe treated as any other sludenl 
Therefore, the suggestion Ilia! 
only those students receiving 
financial aid have their attendance 
rmimtur.-J i-. ,i gross violation ol 
their rights and the law. ll seems 
■ unfair, if not outrighl 



ethical. 



I to 



students as equals. 

Your second argument 
against taking attendance is one 
lhal really raises my ire: "As 
long as the students pass the 
course, whal difference does it 
make?" Is that what you are 
here for, lo pass courses? Is your 
reason for going to college to 
receive a piece of paper with Ihe 
letters B-5. or B.A.? No wonder 
you are so frustrated! 1 have a 
tip for you: You can buy a piece 
or paper like thai oil the Internet 
wilh fancier lellers than B.A. 



Lellers like PhD can be had for 
about S100. Far less degrading 
than attending lecture, don'l 
you think? 

If your reason for taking 
courses is to pass them, then you 
and I have a big problem. The 
Jilk-rence belwecn vour stated 
purpose ("as long as ihe students 
pass, what does it mailer?"! and 
mine could nol be more ditierenl 
I'm not here to pass you. I'm 
here to teach you. I'm here to 
help you understand. The 
iiitorm.ilion in Ihe book is 
knowledge, facts, even trivia, ll 
is Ihe soil in which Ihe Iree 0/ 
understanding grows, but it is 
not Ihe Iree. The only way 1 
know 10 plant lhal tree is by 
spending lime with you, doing 
my best lo show you the beauty 
■mil elegance of the tree you 
voursell can grow. 

We, your faculty, have 
worked many years oul of a love 
of the understanding. We have 
worked to leam, and we're not 
done yet. We've gone Ihrough 
degradations thai you can only 
imagine We have sulfered Ihe 
degradation grudgingly, 
resentfully, occasionally even 
gr.Ki.'iullv. but we have always 
endured oul ol our passion lor 
understanding. If your purpose 
lor taking triors.-, is lo p;iss, how 
can 1 ever make vou understand? 
How Joes one e ■.plain color lo a 



pass, what does it mailer?" It's 
the difference between seeing a 
child and having a child. It's Ihe 



d ill eft-nee between watching Ihe 
Olympics and winning a gold 
medal at Ihe Olympics. I could 
siruggle for a thousand years to 

famous for not being 



able I 



■sof 



the heart. 

Perhaps it was a pm ilegeJ 
upbringing lhal makes my 
altitude ;n oul of tune Neither 
of my parents finished high 
school, lei alone college. I was 
raised wilh an appreciation lor 
understanding and lor education, 
but wilh precious little respect 
tor pieces ol paper with letter- 
on them. My lather did not 
approve when I went lo graduate 
school — bul wilh his eighth 
i;r,ide vdui-.it 1 1.1 n. he understood. 

He lived his life wilh his 
passion and he understood why 
it mattered. Maybe its something 
lhal one either knows in their 
bones, or never will. Maybe I 
should not even Iry. But if I really 
believed lhal. I wouldn't be here 
al 1PFW leaching and Irying lo 
show you lhat passion mailers. 
Ihat it is Ihe only thing that docs. 

Why do some faculty lake 

attendance? Because we'll Iry 
anything and everything we 
know lo gii-e \ou lhat one, all-

In a lime where being

The Penguins scored the 
first seven points of overtime, 
but rather than taking a loss, 
IPFW rallied (or its second con- 
secutive victory, 80-77. 

"That was the second game 
in a row we've done thai, where 
we (ought down to the end and 
won the basketball game," said 
IPFW coach Bruce Patterson. "I 
was very disappointed with 
what we did in the last 10 
minutes o( the second half, and 



quite frankly, in the overtin 
when they got up by seven, 
was gelling pretty nervous."

though, the Dons were only 
down by a point.

A layup by Paul McMillen 
put Loyola ahead 71-68 with

then had three opportunities lo

IPFW's Tyler Clevenger

do it in the end." Noll said 
"They were physical inside We 
reallv ran into some foul trouble 
with our big kids at Ihe end, so 
it was tough to make some 
adjustment, but we tried." 

IPFW {4-16) was led by 
DeAneelo Woodall and Ric

Woodall also finished with lour

Woodall had the task of

The uniforms were the

about those guys gelling a

The Ued Flash never got closer 
than within nine points as the 
Dons cruised to a victory. 

"We didn't play with much
