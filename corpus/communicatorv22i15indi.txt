International unrest 

Civilized world 
not so civil today 



Fifteen months ago, on 
of Nov. 9, 1989, a 
happened. East 
German ana Soviet tr&lt; 
started tearing down 
Berlin Wall. It was a sign 
that the Cold War was fi- 
nally over and for 
everyone had come out a 

More positive events fol- 
lowed. Communist coun- 
tries started moving toward 
democratization of their 
governments. Talks in the 
House and Senate of the 
United States turned toward 
cutting defense spending. 
The reunification of Ger- 
many took place. It seemed 
that the world was finally 
becoming a peaceful place. 

Something happened. The 



Sovi 



it Union' 

nued its downward 
spiral and cracks began to 
show in its 60-year-old 
union. Racism throughout 
the world, and especially in 
the United States took off 
like a raging forest fire. 
African nations mixed 
themselves into shooting 
wars over border disputes. 
Apartheid continued to re- 
sist all efforts to dislodge it 
from South Africa. Two 
countries in the Middle 
East also started their age- 
old border dispute anew. 



these 
Iraq, seemingly overnight, 
decided to finish their ar- 
gument by military 
Resistance in Lithuania, 
and political 
views, came to a head, and 
the Soviet Union sent troops 
rising. 

From 15 short months ago 
until now, the world has 
changed radically, or so it 
seems. It seems, in retro- 
spect, that little in fact has 
changed. Maybe a few new 
infamous names have en- 
tered the limelight, and a 
few new battle lines have 
been drawn. The world of 
man has forever been at 
war with itself. Since the 
time Troy was a city-state 
and was repeatedly sacked 
by marauding Athenians, it 
seems as if man has con- 
tinued to embrace the blood 
and destruction of war. 
Perhaps it is naive to think 
that man would ever learn 
a lesson from his own past.
