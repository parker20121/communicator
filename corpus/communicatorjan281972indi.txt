War objector Jeff Gibson to be sentenced 



On Wednesday, Febru; 
at 1:30, the first draft re- 
sistance case to reach sen- 
tencing in the Ft. Wayne 
Federal Court will be con- 
cluded. At that time sentenc- 
ing will be determined for 
Jeff Gibson, a Philosophy 
and Theater Major here at 
Purdue. 

Gibson has plead "nolo 
contendere," which means 
"I admit to the facts but 
do not admit to committing 
a crime. " This is the 
first time a nolo plea has 
been accepted by this Fed- 
eral Court in a draft resis- 
tance case. 

Gibson has intentionally 
not complied with the draft 
law in order to draw atten- 
tion to the ethical and 
moral issues raised by our 
foreign policy, our in- 
volvement in Vietnam, and a 
system that endorses kill- 
ing. Gibson refused to apply 
for conscientious objector 
classification because he felt 



this 



uld ) 



ment of the system, which he 
feels, in itself is immoral. 
According to Gibson, it 
would amount to saying, it is 
a Lright to take someone else 
and ask them to kill, as 
long as you don't take me. 
"This is unacceptable.." 



The Gibson trial points 
up the difference between 
draft resistance and draft 
evasion, a difference that 
frequently has been blurred 
by the many differing atti- 
tudes about the draft laws. 
As Gibson sees it, the only 
alternatives for men who be- 
lieve that killing is con- 
trary to their religious con- 
victions, is non-cooperation, 
active non-cooperation. 
"Pacifism is not to be con- 
fused with passivism," 
according to Gibson. 

"The question is not, 
'Can a man be a soldier and 
preach th Gospel as if the 
Gospel were a compartment in 

preach the Gospel by waging 

In pleading "nolo conten- 
dere," Gibson waived the 
right to a jury trial. Judge 
Jesse Fschbach immediately 
found Gibson guilty. However 
at the February 2 sentencing, 
Gibson will have an opportun- 
ity to make a statement about 
the issues he is concerned 
with. Such statements would 
be inadmissible in a jury 
trial. 

Apparently Gibson's case 
is unprecedented in this 
area, and possibly nationally. 
Those who are interested in 
the case or issues tr.i; -t- 



cing at 1:30, 
V'ednesdgy, February ? at the 
'ednral Building (the Main 
Post Office). 

Mon, is deadline 
for senate petitions 

Monday, Jan. 31, is the

Letters — 

ear Editors: 

To those of us who hate 
lothtng more than reading 
ampus news zn Friday ;norn- 
n3B , your bold new Approach 
to Journfllis.n Is indeed wel- 
- lined, Yju cannot comprehend 
he thrill I experienced as 
I picked up a copy of the 
last COMMUNICATOR, and, in- 
stead of being forced to read 
-bout Activity Card Pictures, 
"ree Concerts by the Division 
&gt;f Music, Student Senate 
lections, Mid-Winter Carnl- 
al, etc, I was treated to 
i mood-stimulating picture 
■ f trees, snow and sidewalks. 

However, I must confess 
hat I am somewhat perplexed 
s to the intent of the front 
age of the last issue. I 
uspect that you arc attempt- 
ng to make the COMMUNICATOR 
more artistic publication, 
nd consequently, more rel- 
vant to a college campus. 
low a picture of OePauw Uni- 
versity relates to I-PFW, I 
am not sure. 

But then, maybe you .ire 
•eglnnlng a new weekly fca- 
ure, In which we will pic- 
orlally'tour the other col- 
ege campuses in the state, 
iext week, you can run a 
•icture of the goalposts at 
he Notre Dame football sta- 
ium. Other possibilities 
re the "A" parking lot at 
urdue-West Lafayette, the 
ustodlal locker room at Han- 
ver, and the new urinals at 
■t. Mary's. 

The next logical step Is 
o run nude fold-oats of 
embers of the University 
lerlcal staff. This would 
e the ultimate in art. 

In conclusion, it is good 
o know that the S7.000 al- 
ocated for publishing a stu- 
lant newspaper is not being 
•asted on such nonsense. 
ongratulatlons for your 
ost recent success in yojr 
ontinuing effort to prevent 
his newspaper from being 
Istaken for one.

Dear Editors: 

I don' t understand the 
necessity to editorialize 
the article, "Christian mor- 
ality on war to be portrayed," 
that appeared In your Janu- 
ary ?1 publication of "Com- 
municator." Can't your staff 
report something as simple as 
an upcoming play without re- 
sorting to phrases like "... 
presents with full force the 
contemporary dilemna of liv- 
ing according to Christian 
Ideals which forces war upon 
Southeast Asia..." and "... 
Christians. . .going to prisons 
for political crimes..."? Ever 
the first sentence is loaded. 
"Christian morality lead nine 
Catholics to civil disobedi- 
ence. What upsets me is the 
article wasn't even labeled 
as an editorial. 

Who is this fella that's 
so presumptuous as to say 
that Christian ideals are 
contemporary. Contemporary! 
Fully one-third of written 
history Is full of this 
"contemporary" dilemna ! 

And " Christians. . .going 

to prison etc." 1 feel sure 
that if I had a political 
disagreement with the IU-PU 
administration and pulled 
Berrlgan's trick here, it 
wouldn' t be classed as a 
political crime by anyone 
but me. Or, would you excuse 
that just because 1 said I 
did it for political reasons? 
Just how would Berrigan's 
rrotives differ from mine. 
Was Berrigan's act, in itself, 
a "political" crime? 1 don't 
think so. 

Berrigan's act can't even 
be classified as civil dis- 
obedience. Civil disobedi- 
ence does not consist of 
physical destruction. In 
the definition of civil, 
Berrigan's act and the def- 
inition are contradictory. 

Granting Christians a 
point, I feel Jesus Christ 
would roll over In his grave 
at the type of thing one of 
his ministers did.

Dear Editors: 

Regarding the front page 
of last week's Cotnmunicat &gt;r , 
two comments: 

1.) Although I applaud 
your increasing use of 
photography, I must question 
its placement. Given that 
the Communicator' s primary 
function is to report campus 
news, full page pictures or 
pictorial features are more 
appropriately located else- 
where in the paper. 

?.) Even though the 
aesthetic beauty of the pic- 
ture is readfly evident, 
this beauty- is lost when one 
realizes that the picture w.ii 
taken at Oep.iuu- University. 
The effect would have been 
so much greater If the pic- 
ture were of some scene on 
this Campus. 

The quality of your photo 
graphy is improving; 1 only 
hope that, in the future, thi 
same can be said of your 
utilization of this photo- 
graphy. 
--David James 



D.-ar E-itors: 

I would like to take the 
oportunlty to publicly thank 
the young ran who found my 
wrist' atch and turned it in 
to the Office of Safety and 
Security. His act is very 
much appreciated, and since 
the watch van quit,- rs'.uoole 
to me, I feel that his hones- 
ty should no: go unrecognirod. 
--Sincerely,

To the Editors 



Student urges environmental letters 



Dear Editor, 

The state legislature is 
nearly at the end of its 
short session. In order to 
remedy the environmental cri- 
sis the state must provide 
matching funds to obtain 
federal funds to which it is 
entitled. In the past, in- 
sufficient funds for agency 
operations and programs have 
been budgeted and even when 
authorized have not necessar- 
ily been released by the State 
Budget Office. 

Letters are urgently need- 
ed. If you don't have a 
stamp, pay a friend to send 
a telegram, or better yet, go 
to Indianapolis or call your 
representatives listed below. 

The following matters are 
of greatest environmental 
Importance: 

1) Etate Agency budgetary 
needs are set at 515,000,000 
to make up for the deficiency 
in funds for matching grants 
to cities for waste water 
treatment. 

2) Witrin the State Board 
of Health, the Division of 
Water Pollution Control needs 
S720.000; and the Division f 
Air Pollution Control requires 
51,103,000. 

1) The Department of Natur- 
al Resources, including the 
Division of State Parks, Fish 
and Wildlife Division, Division 
of State Forests, and the Div- 
ision of Reservoir Recreation, 
needs 5915,000. 

4) The Nature Preserve Act 
of 1967 has never been funded 
and we support the implementa- 
tion of this act as fully as 
possible. 

The above items need pub- 
lic support to be passed by 
the legislators. 

To protect the landmark 
law of last session, Public 



Law 174, which reduces the 
level of phosphates of 
detergents to 12* in 1972, 
we oppose S.B. 1108 and 
any industry lobby measure 
which would further delay 
enforcement of this water 
pollution prevention law. 

We oppose S.B. 49, which 
would cause county park 
boards to serve at the whim 
of other county officials, 
and to lose any sound or 
secure funding, endangering 
planning and continuity in 
land acquisition for parks. 

We support S.B. 116, which 
would require a. cash deposit 
of 5c on beverage bottles 
and prohibit the sale of met- 
al cans with detachable parts 
This measure will help pre- 
vent littering and waste of

Psychology Club 
entertains itself 

The Psychology Club pul- 
led off one of the most suc- 
cessful gatherings of facul- 
ty an I students ever recorded 
in I-PU history. Last Sat- 
urday night, at Dr. Cannon's 
home, approximately 30 to 40 
of the Freudian sympathizers 
assembled for pretzels, beer 
and conversation. 

Daryl Woolems and Dr. 

ndled the prepara- 
tions for the party. Similar 
club events will undoubtedly 
be scheduled soon, since the 
turnout and results of this 
party were so encouraging. 
If you have an interest 
in Psych . , but missed the 
party, be sure to keep an eye 
peeled for our upcoming lec- 
tures and social gatherings.

Gov. Whitcomb explains 
State views on taxes 



Dave King makes 
Congressional bid 



With an acknowledgment of 
his willingness to reveal the 
progress made for State bene- 
fit by his Administration de- 
spite his refusal to raise 
taxes, Governor F.dgar Whitcomb 



, of J 



mid 



took the occasl 
afternoon press conference at 
the Indiana-Purdue campus to 
explain his stand in regard 
to tax issues and property 
tax legislation currently be- 
fore the Indiana General As- 
sembly. 

Terming the 6 step property 
tax abatement package "a sham" 
the Governor offered the opin- 
ion that the property tax 
proposal up for passage by 
the House and Senate would 
not allow long term property 
tax relief. "We would pos- 
sibly enjoy temporary proper- 
ty tax relief and then see it 
wiped away in a year or two," 
he claimed. Moreover, as 
Whitcomb added, the property 
tax proposal would prove to 
be considerably balanced in 
favor of tax relief for 
larger corporations and hence 
discriminatory to the average 
taxpayer. Public awareness of 
the discrepancies in the pro- 
perty tax package should 
foster a reaction of thank- 
fulness on the part of the 
citizenry if the tax bill 
fails to win legislative ap- 
proval, Whitcomb maintained. 
In the words of the Gover- 
nor, "The result should be 
jubilation." 

Armed with various statis- 
tical charts, and accompanied 
by th State Budget Director, 
Tom Taylor, the Governor pre- 
sented ■ program designed to 
clarify the accomplishments 
of his Administration in re- 



gard to upgraded services for 
Hooslers on all levels and 
of j11 types. Despite a 
lack of rise in taxes, for 
example, eduea;tonal funding 
under his tenure has increas- 
ed by approximately $140 mil- 
lion and correctional facili- 
ties funding has been ex- 
panded by over $4 million. 
Mental health allottments 
have climbed by $1,803 per 
patient while the state men- 
tal institutions have begun 
a series of internal improve- 
ments as a direct result of 
Increased funding. 

Inclusively, the Governor 
noted, "We have been able to

stration has sometimes been 
referred to as an austerity 
program. If this is austeril 
we should have more of It." 



Fielding questions on 
other topics from newsmen, 
Governor Whitcomb announced 
that he has "no attitude" up 
diverse plans to alter the 
ballots utilized in primary 
elections and stated that 
although the present session 
of the General Assembly is 
limited to 10 days, "a great 
many things will be accomp- 
lished." He also commented 
that he expects to approve

office expires.

Urban America, Inc. He said 
he did not seek re-election 
for a third term in 1971 be- 
cause he wished to "expand 
my efforts beyond the Cleve- 
land area to assist others, 
particularly the locked-in 
minority groups, to better 
understand their role in 
politics and government."

of Political Science, recent- 
ly authored an article for 
the Caucus for the New Politi- 
cal Science. 

In his selection, "The 
Caucus and its Future," Dr. 
Housemann stated three ob- 
jectives of the Caucus as 
being: 

1) an attempt to become a 
permanent organization. 

2) the need to build up 
contacts with people of dif- 
ferent fields with related 
interests. 

3) foresight to plan beyond 
the preliminary stages of 
election of officers and to 
set priorities in funding al 
locations. 

The Caucus is a faction 
of the American Political 
Science Association and is 
made up of members dissatis- 
fied with the organization 
because of the irrevelancy 
of research and the mis- 
management of association 
funds. Dr. Housemann serves 
on the AFSA Executive Com- 
mittee. 



renews free 
bowling offer 

Brunswick Lanes, Fort 
Wayne, has announced that 
its offer to host a party 
for prospective league bowl- 
ers is Btill open. The 
party will consist of two 
free bowling games, free 
shoe rental, and refresh- 
ments for each of the first 
150 students to sign up. 

At the completion of the 
bowling, Brunswick officials

Free University lists 
new classes 



Die Deutsche Ecke 



This spring semester the 
Student' Government will of- 
fer the fourth series of 
Free University classes. The 
Free University was origi- 
nated by 1970-71 Student Body 
President Scott Gillie and 
has been continued during 
this administration because 
of Its strength as a program. 

The Free University is co- 
ordinated through the Depart- 
ment of the Interior, under 
the direction of Secretary 
Steve Evans. Steve's pri- 
mary problem in formulating 
the curriculum is finding 
peoplr interesting In serv- 
ing as Instructors of classes. 
Classes may be offered in 
nearly any conceivable sub- 
ject. If one feels he has 
sufficient expertise in a 
subject matter, we urge him 
to teach the class. 
They are totally autonomous 
in the teaching of their 
class. They choose the time 
it is to be taught, the num- 
ber of weeks it is to run, 
the materials to be used, 
etc. We will schedule a 
room on campus for the class 
to meet and register students 
for the class. 

Steve has already schedul- 
ed three classes for the 
Spring Series. Tnese are: 

1. Chess To Live, by Don 
Gilllg: Some basic moves to 
improve your game and enjoy 
it. Plans, openings, endings, 
strategies, etc. 

2. Environmental Quality 
class, by Izaak Walton League: 
Possible topics are Soil, 
Parks, River Basins, Water 
Quality, Citizen Action, and 
Phosphates and PollutantB, An 
especially unique feature of 
this course will be field 
trips along with possible 
weekend outings. 

3. Dan Motto will teach a 
course related to his work as 
Campus Minister. 

Potential instructors 
should submit to the Students' 
Government, by February 11, 
a description of the course 
and the time which the class 



will meet. We extend a 
special Invitation to the 
UniversLty Faculty to parti- 
cipate in this program. 

If there is sufficient 
interest expressed to us 
for a particular topic or 
subject, we will attempt to 
locate an instructor. 

Registration is scheduled 
for February 14-18. Classes 
will begin the week of Feb. 
21 and will run no longer thar 
eight weeks. 

We feel that the Free Uni- 
versity has a lot to offer to 
the Student Body. It provid- 
es an opportunity for stu- 
dents to learn more about a 
subject in which they are in- 
terested. Also, it provides 
more informal types of con- 
tact between students and 
professors, which this campus 
definitely needs. 

We urge all students to 
participate in tha Tree Uni- 
versity, either as Instruc- 
tors or as students.

SWARAJ 



by Scull Gillie 
_l 



Co-editor Meneely resigns; 
petitions now being accepted 



Here Is a hypothetical 
situation. The Idea comes 
from Paul Goodman. 

Ten faculty members se- 
cede from the university. 
Along with the secession of 
the faculty members, two hun- 
dred students secede also. 
Together they elect to start 
their own university. Let's 
explore their plans. 

Each teacher will teach 
three courses per semester 
with twenty students In each 
class. Each course will be 
for three credits (there 
really are no credits as such 
except for the purpose of 
this illustration). Each 
student will pay $15.00 per 
credit hour. This means that 
In the course of one year, 
each faculty member will gen- 
erate $5400 In student fees. 

Since, I am told, student 
costs represent one third of 
the cost of higher education, 
and since the State of Indi- 
ana has graciously offered 
to kick in the other two 
thirds, the total money gen- 
erated Is $16,200 per faculty 
member. If we pay each 
faculty member $10,000 for 

t»o semesters of »ork this mlmMi , s . mav „,„ „,. 
.llov, 56,200 for each faculty u co i v „ t= d Into 

member to purchase necessary 
equipment, rent a room in 
which to hold class meetings 
and allows a token amount to 
be given back to the taxpay- 
ers. If our ten teachers 
wish, each teacher's $6,200 
could be pooled topethcr, 
$62,000 per year In the com- 
munity fund. . . 

Since our university is 
relatively small , there Is 
really no need for a huge 
chain of administrators. Ad- 
ministrative necessities 
(keeping names and addresses 
of students and counting the 
money) can be divided among 
the members of our small com 
munlty. By cutting costs on 
administration, we may be 
able to return a larger 
amount to the taxpayers than 
we thought. 

In a university community 
with only 210 members, there 
is a lessened possibility 
that students will be pro- 
cessed, computerized, and, i' 
general, lost in the shuffle 
University policy In this ex 
perlment will be decided by 
people who know each other! 

Of course, some programs 
of study requiring huge In- 
vestments in capital cannot 
be offered through the auspice 
of this experiment. But we 
didn't say that our universit; 
would be comprehensive. We 
are primarily discussing a 
liberal arts university. 

Also, ue may hold some re- 
servations about our univer- 
sity ever becoming a "pres- 
tige" school. But we keep 
in mind that the traditional 
university of the middle ages 

6 



averaged eight to ten faculty 
members and a student popu- 
lation of about one hundred 
fifty. 

If such an experiment were 
applied widely. Fort Wayne 
might suddenly be blessed 
with a score or more of tiny 
universities. The dynamic 
effects of this experiment on 
the Fort Wayne community are 
difficult to imagine. 

The beneficial effects 
upon students are equally 
difficult to imagine, but 
let's dream a little more. 
Since university policy Is 
made by the members of the 
community (this was a huge 
concession for the State to 
make), the possibility of 
absurd course requirements 
Is greatly diminished. The 
requirements which are made 
will be subject to immediate 
feedback. Requirements will 
be justifiable or the policy- 
makers will find life diffi- 
cult within the community. 
Registration procedures will 
be simplified somewhat. Stu- 
dents pay their teachers dir- 

The degree offered by our 
university may not be Immed- 

ash; 
but then maybe what our stu- 
dents learn will be valued 
somewhere in society. 

It seems so simple.

Mark Souder, Chairman of 
the Publications Board, has 
announced that petitions are 
now being accepted for the 
position of Editor of THE 
COMMUNICATOR. The position 
Is open due to the resignation 
of Co-editor Tommy Meneely, 
effective Feb. 2. 

Miss Meneely and Janet 
Weaver were appointed Co- 
editors last spring. Be- 
cause of the conditions of 
the Co-edltorship, a 30 day 
petitioning period is re- 
quired before a permanent 
editor can be selected. Miss 
Weaver has been appointed 
temporary editor until a 
permanent editor Is selected 
following the petitioning 

To qualify applicants must 
be enrolled In nine or more 
credit hours with either or 
both Universities and must 
have a 2.0 (Indiana) or 4.0 
(Purdue) accumulative grade 
index. 

More Information may be 
obtained in the office^of the 
Students' Government," Room 



G4. A brief resume of the 
applicants' past accomplish- 
ments, quslificatlons, and 
goals should be submitted. 
The deadline for petitioning 
is February 25. 

"Taste for Love" 
is movie of week 

A Taste for Love is a pro- 
duct of a new generation of 
German film makers who arose 
to creative prominence after 
the crippling effects of 
World War II. It cost only 
about $75,000 to produce, and 
captured a large audience and 
a prize for the best film at 
the Venice Film Festival. 

The film will be shown to- 
day In room 146 at 4:30, 7 and 
9:30 p.m. and is free to stu- 
dents and faculty members. 

Essentially a look at the 
social mores that bind peo- 
ple together In marriage, and 
the social pressures that eat 
at and disintegrate the mar- 
riage, A Taste For Love is the 
story of Elisabeth (Heidi 
Stroh) and Rolf (Georg Hauke).

Communicator interviews student body prexy 



The following is the tran- 

cript of an interview of M- 

ark Franke, Student Body 

resident. The interview 

■as conducted by Scott Gillie. 

!. What is the top achieve- 
ment of Student Govern- 
ment thus far this year? 

I. Abolishing t&gt;'e Student 

Activities Advisory Board. 

I. What effect will this have 
upon students? 

I. This eliminates an agency 
which could veto and stall 
allocations of the student s . 
activity fee money. 

i. This means that alloca- 
tions go straight to the 
Deans for approval? h. 

1. Yes. 

J. Which Deans? s. 

1. Dean Manges and Tom Scott 
(Business Manager). 

J. Since the S.A.A.B. has 

been abolished, would h. 

you say that there Is now 
a more direct route to 
frustration? 

4. Yes, you might say that. 
3. What would you say has 

been the biggest draw- s, 

back of student govern- 
ment this year" 
■I. Our own personal time 

limitations. We cannot do m. 
things as completely as 
we would like. 

5. Would a salary or some 
sore of remuneration for 
members of student govern- 
ment help this situation? 

M. It might alleviate some 

of the problem, but I feel 
It would cause more prob- 
lems than it wjuld solve. 

S. If you (student jjovern- 
ment) had more time, what 
activities would student 



government pursue? 
We would io a better job 
of those tilings we do now. S. 
For instance, we would 
be able to research more 
thoroughly. We would be M. 
able to keep more people 
informed of mare situa- 
tions. It would help to 
eliminate our greatest 
liability, not enough 
people know enough of the 
facts about as many situa- 
tions as they should. 
Would you say, then, that 
because of time limita- 
tions, student government 
is ineffective? s - 

Ho, but It is not as ef- 
fective as it might be. H - 
There has been some talk 
3bout abolishing student s - 
government. What is your 
feeling about this? 
Abolishing student govern- 
ment would not make things 
better, it would simply M - 
eliminate those things 
that we can accomplish for 
students. 

What consequences would 
students notice immediately 
if student government were 
abolished? 

The Activity Fee-funded 
programs (Convocations , S. 

Student Union Board, PIT) 
would more than likely 
deteriorate in quality or M « 
disappear altogether. Al- 
so, many smaller ur less 
noticeable improvements in 
student life would be much 
less likely to occur. For 
instance, had It not been 
for student government 
action, the overflow free S. 
parking lot would not have 



been covered with cinders, 
or at least, not as soon. 
What are the greatest ob- 
stacles to student self- 
government? 

The major obstacle is a 
tendency to not be re- 
cognized by administration, 
faculty, community, etc . 
as a legitimate organ for 
expressing student opinion. 
Also, many people refuse 
to admit that college 
students are mature enough 
to make their own decisions 
or to choose their own 
values. 
This smacks of out and out 



pat. 



alls 



Unfortunately, in many In- 
stances it is. 
This accounts for the rel- 
ative lack of interest 
the student body has in 
the activities of stu- 
dent government . Correct? 
This might quite possibly 
be correct. Because we 
cannot always produce im- 
mediate results, it appears 
as if we are totally in- 
effective. Many actions 
of student government do 
not yield results until- 
two or three ypars later. 
What does the future hold 
for student government? 
More of the same? 
I like to be very optimis- 
tic about the future. As 
student government becomes 
more sophisticated In 
its methods of operation, 
it will necessarily have 
to become more effec- 
tive. 
What is the operating 
budget of Btudent gov- 



ern'tient (excluding 
Ccnvo and S.L'.B.) this 
year? 
M. Around S5.000. Ills 
is used for office ex- 
penses sucb as print- 
ing, telephone bills, 

S. This seems to be a 
large sun to p*&gt;y for 
the abolishment of the 
Student Activities Ad- 
visory Board. 

M. That would oe true if 
that was all ft paid 
for. 

S. Would you say thit stu- 
dents, as a class, have 
interests that are not 
and cannot be repre- 
sented through student 
government? 

H. We cannot even hope to 
represent all interests, 
We try to represent as 
many as we can. 

S. Would you encourage the 
development of depart- 
ment advisory boards to 
represent student con- 
cerns in curricular 

M. Yes, such board-, are 
definitely needed. 

S. Overall, are you satis- 
fied with the operation 
of student government? 

M. No. I would like to 
see student government 
be much more effective 
than it Is now. 

Similar interviews will 
be held with the top lead- 
ers of the campus. The 
Communicator solicits y?ur 
questions of the officials 
of this campus. 



'DePauw, Jeff Gibson, and Onions' a, i see n Cirde K 



entertains 



by Mark Souder 

"Darling, there is some- 
thing I must know. Am I the 
first man to sleep with you?" 
"You will be, sweetheart. 
if you doze off." 

While you may seldom agree 
with me, I hope my columns do 
at least provide entertaining 
reading. I realize that, as 
Seneca once said, "It is the 
habit of the mob to snarl at 
great men, much as little 
dogs bark at strangers." 

This week I'd like to make 
a few random comments. Our 
usually superb newspaper pul- 
led a real winner last week, 
featuring a front-page pic- 
ture of DePauw University. I 
took it personally. But the 
editors' excuse was at least 
unlque--the photographer 
spends a lot of time there. 
Oh! Chalk that one up to fe- 
male editors. I had always 
heard that an intelligent wo- 
man was a center of attrac- 
tion, as is anything else 
rare. 

Actually the newspaper 
people are doing an unprece- 
dented^ (I can make adverbs 



out of adjectives; I'm a 
writer) fine job. The co- 
editors, Janet Weaver and the 
other Mark's Tommy Meneely, 
have shown unusual feminine 
ability (they must have some 
masculine tendencies). Pretty 
Carol Reinhart diligently 
types the copy and, along 
with Sue Krom, corrects my 
spelling errors. News editor 
Liz Schevtchuk patiently waits 
in the newspaper office for 
news to come in. The others, 
from smiling Mary Heck to 
effervescent Debbie Fester, 
spend many hours working for 

It's kind of sad to see 
Jeff Gibson's sentencing day 
approach. It's unfortunate 
to see the war and related 
issues divide us. No sane 
person in this country likes 
the war in Viet Nam, and 
neither does Jeff. Though 
Jeff and I have our disagree- 
ments, I'll miss his presence. 

And speaking of PIT (you've 
got to be articulate to make 
a transition like that), I 
hear they are going to be 
producing a fairy tale this 



semester. I hope my sweet 
little friend who cusses is 
in it. 

Boy, theatre is going to

Intramurals contest in 
prelim games Sunday 



Putt, Powell add 19 each 
for Mastodon victory 



by Mark SouHo- 

A much ballyhooed prelimin- 
ary game to the long-awaited 
intramural basketball season 
occurred out at Leo High 
School on Sunday, Janjary 33. 
Intramural basketball, with 
its hotly contested rival- 
ries and exciting competition, 
is the highlight of many an 
Indiana-Purdue student's year, 

This year, as It has every 
year, the intramural league 
will continue its fantastic 
growth rate, one which dwarfs 
the Increasing enrollment 
ratio. Hundreds of sweating 
guys, and a few girls, will 
venture out onto the thrill- 
ing hardwood. 

Usually the league is very 
imba lanced . Some teams con- 
sist of card-playing buddies 
or studious looking math 
majors. The bookworms and 
beerguts seldom win, but even 
defeats are fun and oh, are 
the few victories sweet. 

Then there are the tougher 
teams which always have a 
few hotshots. Usually they 
roll through the seasonal 
warm-ups, except for the rare 
occasion of when they meet 
each other, in preparation 
for the big tourney. The 
tournament winners receive 
trophies and a year's worth 
of gloating. 

Many of the names are fami- 
liar to most students from 
high school ball. The pre- 
season super team of the 
league--Jim Chaney and Brad 
Hall of Snider, Ed Humphreys 
of Bishop Dwenger, and Tom 
Helmkamp of Central Catholic-- 
has many quivering. All 
played in high school, as 
did other team members such 
as Daryl Woolums. With a 
front-line averaging 6-4 
or a little higher, things 
are definitely looking up 
for them. 



Then there's the faculty 
basketball for Lunch bunch. 
Doc Leonard, Jim Bolinger, and 
company not only can outdrink 
most students but can outplay 
them as well. Add Jim Whttt, 
the former Indiana Tech 
sharpshooter, and the old 
■ten are going to win a few. 

Actually, like last year, 
the winner could come out of 
the woodwork. Tim Laughlin, 
the former Bishop Luers ball- 
Player, plays on the basically 
intact Ottenweller team, 
which made it into last year's 
tourney. Another tourney 
team, Hoehn, though featur- 
ing affable Louie Rpy of 
Bishop Dwenger and former 



All-City football star Mike 
Stiffler, could be tabbed the 
"unknowns." But it's tough 
to predict until all the 
cards are out on the table. 

Two of the better teams, 
and one of the better rival- 
ries, squared off Sunday. 
Brock's Jocks is a team 
coached by student senator 
Brock Able. The Leo Mafia, 
consisting largely of Leo 
grads, is coached by yours 
truly. 

Abie's team includes 
North Side's Former All-City 
guard Rich Yost, former Elm- 
hurst player Steve Tobias, 
star baseball pitcher Steve 
Winebrenner, Jim Hansen, 
Frank Franks, and Herb Parlick 
Big Brett Able, home over 
break from Purdue, provided 
the knock-out punch for his 
brother 1 s team. Last year 
Brett and Eugene Devbrow were 
probably the best individual 
players in the league. Brett's 
best was over 6n points. 
That's pretty good. The team 
was short former Churubusco 
ace Tom Blackburn and Steve 
Robinson. 

The Leo Mafia was led by 
grad students Steve Bollier 
of Leo and Kim Cress of 
Central, Both were key play- 
ers in high school and Kim 
at the University of Miami. 
Another former Leo star, Tom 
Sebert, and two other Leo 
grads, Stan Jones and John 
Perkins, played. Team mem- 
bers not present include 
former Concordia and Indi- 
ana University football play- 
er Don Grote, former Elkhart 
basketball player Gordon 
Pixley, and Bruce Menshy of 
Leo. 

The promising game turned 
into a rout. The heighth, 
speed, and balance of Brock's 
Jocks proved too much. The 
smaller Leo boys were tied'iO- 
20, fell behind by 16, caught 
up, only to fall far behind 
again. By the end of the 
grueling hour and a half, 
Brock's Jocks were up 30. 

The game proved several 
things. It proved that all 
Leo country ballplayers aren't 
invincible. It proved that 
Stan Jones should worry about 
Convo, John Perkins should con. 
centrate on math, and I, on an; 

thing else. It proved Brock 
Able can coach better than 
he can play chess. It proved 
thac the team that plays bet- 
ter usually wins. And it 
proved that Brock's Jocks 
played bettec--this time. 

It also proved -hat the 
1972 season is going to be 
another barnbjrner. And 
sway we go. 



Raising their record to 
8-9, the Mastodon basketball 
team edged International 
College, 66-66 last Tuesday 
night. Mark Putt and John 
Powell each scored 19 points 



to pace the winners. Paul 
Jacquay was next with 11 
points.

a game in 12 starts this 
year. The Mastodons lost 
high-scoring Tyrone Bishop

bility. 

lU-Southeast is the op- 
ponent in an away game for
