HPER interest accrues 

Funds found 



Indiana University-Purdue University at Ft. Wayne 



February 5, 1981 



By JIM CHAPMAN 
Chic r Reporter 

A budget cut has closed (he avenue 
leading to (he Health, Physical 
Education and Recreation (HPER&gt; 
building. 1PFW may have found a 
partial solution to the problem, but 
there are still many potholes in the 
street which must be taken to reach 
that goal. 

On Dec. 4, 1980, an article appeared in 
The Communicator that reported a 
budget cut that would affect the inside 
of the HPER Building. The budget cut 
was due to a last minute balancing of 
budgets in the Indiana General 
Assembly, the State Budget Agency 
and the stale legislature, and IPFW's 
gymnasium was slighfed 5582,579. The 
funding was needed to furnish the in- 
side of the building. 

The inside of the HPER Building was 
planned lo have 18 functional areas the 
cost of which totalled 5582,579. This 
included such items as lockers, 
bleachers, scoreboards, volleyball 
sockets, standards, and nets, gym- 
nastic equipment. But IPFW was 
granted authorization to borrow only 
$4.1 million instead of 54. 6 
million— which is what they originally 
asked for, so they ended up 5582,579 
short and faced the task of finding the 
remainder so IPFW fans will not have 
to watch their basketball team while 
sitting on the floor. 

The original solution was to go back 
to the local legislature ano ask them to 
represent IPFW at the state 
legislature, but IPFW has learned 
that between S200,000 and $300,000 can 
be obtained from interest accrued from 
the initial $4.1 million which was placed 
in an account. IPFW has to get state 
appropriation to spend the interest. 

Using the interest accrued from the 
original 54.1 million is still only half the 
battle for IPFW. The interest covers 
roughly half the cost needed to furnish 
the inside, which means that some 
functional areas would be left out. What 
next? 

John P. Ulmer, dean of student 
services and David R. Skelton, athletic 
director, along with Donald Katter, 
director of purchasing, made up a 
priority list of what the inside of the 
gymnasium needed the most. The 
functional areas were ranked ac- 
cording to necessity and how long they 
would take to order, 

Ulmer and Skelton decided that 
bleachers, scoreboards, and lockers 
were the most important items and 
would go at the top of the list. At the 
bottom of the priority list was A.V. 
equipment. The two decided that if any 



Budget needs 
under review 



By SANDRA WILEY 
Editor-in-chief 

Planning a budget and living within it 
is something most people, companies 
and individuals must do and IPFW is 
no exception. 

The assessing of the university's 
financial needs, as well as monitoring 
its spending and trying to trim away 
excesses without cutting important 
programs or operations, is a continual 
process for IPFW's administration. 

Never, however, is the assessment 
and trimming process more important 
than it is now; 1981 is the year of the 
"long session" of the Indiana General 
Assembly, in which the state 
legislature decides how much money 
will be budgeted for India..;; institutions 
of higher education. 

Thus, IPFW administrators look hard 
and long at all aspects of the univer- 
sity's budget during this time. 

Of supreme importance to IPFW is 
Ihe amount of funds the General 
Assembly allocates to Purdue and 
Indiana universities: It is from the 
amounts given to both these univer- 
sities that the amounts received by 
IPFWaredelermined. 

The state pocketbook is the largest 
single source of revenue for IPFW, said 
John R, Carnaghi, vice chancellor for 
financial affairs, and it provides about 
75 percent of its needs. (Another 23-24 
percent is from student fees; the 
remaining 1-2 percent comes from 
other sources.) 

To prepare Ihe university's budget in 
Ihe event that not all monies requested 
are granted, a letter has been sent lo 
each department of IPFW, asking (he 
department to determine where dollars 
could be trimmed from the depart- 
ment's budget. 

Besides listing areas of its budget in 
which cuts could be made, each 
department is to list the areas In which 
it would use more money, If such added 
monies were made available, Carnaghi 
said. 

He said lhal although the General 
Assembly has yet to determine IU's and 
Purdue's budgets, from which the 
IPFW budgel is determined, the local 
administration does no! want lo wait 
until the "lllh hour" lo decide where 
cutsoraddilions will be made, and that 
is why each department is listing its 
priorities 



area was to be cut, il would be the A.V. 
equipment in case the remainder of 
money (after the interest was used) 
would not be available, however, they 
did not intend to cut Ihe A.V. equipment 
from Ihe lis! once and for all. 

"We will eventually get everything on 
(hat list inio (he gym, it just turned out 
thai (he A.V. equipment was on the 
bottom of the list," said John R. Car- 
naghi, vice chancellor for financial 
affairs. 

"We decided that we could do without 
(he A.V. equipment for now," Ulmer 
said. 

The decision to possibly cut the A.V. 
equipment from the priority list would 
result in lowering the shortage of 
money needed to furnish the inside 
from $582,579 lo approximately 
5500,000, of which between $200,000 and 
$300,000 could be paid by the interest 
accrued from the initial $4.1 million 
after state approval. But how is the 
remainder, which could add up lo 
approximately 5250,000, going to be 
supplied? 

According to Carnaghi, "IPFW will 
ask Fredrick R. Ford (Executive Vice 
President and Treasurer of Purdue, 
West Lafayette) to check into funds 
available to us from other sources that 
are presently in reserves for other 
uses." 

Even if IPFW ends up gaining back 
all of the shortage, their problem is still 
not over. One more step must still be 
taken. 

Once IPFW's sporfs facility is com- 
pleted, funds will be needed from the 
state legislature to meet the recurring 
expenses of operating the building. 
These expenses cover such costs as 
salaries for custodians and other 
maintenance workers, utilities, 
basketballs, light bulbs and necessities 
such as soap and restroom tissue. 

Funds for these recurring costs need 
Lo be granted every year. 

As of this year, the Commission on 
Higher Education approved IPFW's bid 
for 5236,187 to pay the recurring ex- 
penses for the HPER Building. But 
because of a lack of stale funds, various 
stale agencies involved in Ihe budget 
process have cut this fund and olher 
ilems dealing with increases lo higher 
education. The poor state of the 
economy has been blamed for ihe cuts. 
If IPFW cannot come up with a way 
to get this money, the HPER Building 
may not be available for use. 

"If we can't get the money out of the 
slate, I don't see how we can open the 
building. We won't have the ability to 
open the building, ' ' said Carnaghi. 
What next? 




Student attrition 
rate high here

Kettler elevator falls 



By KARL JAY SMITH 
Staff Writer 

One of Kettler Hall's elevators fell 
three stories last Monday giving Joe 
O'Brien and Mike Hayes a ride they 
won't forget. They're glad the 
elevator has safety brakes. 

O'Brien and Hayes are two of the 
many students employed by the 
Learning Resource Center (LRO. 
LRC employees must use the 
elevators constantly while moving 
the equipment needed by professors 
from floor lo floor. 

O'Brien and Hayes enlered the left 
elevator at the second floor level, 
O'Brien said he then "pushed the 
button for the first floor and Ihe 
elevator went into free-fall; it 
stopped about two feet past (he 
bisement floor level. I pushed the 
first floor button again and the 
elevator wenl back up to the second 
floor and slopped about one foot to 
high." 

"Yeah, we thought it was all over. 
Write home lo ma, 'Dear Mom, Joey 
is dead.' I don't intend on using that 
elevator again." 

Hayes said lhal when the elevator 



started falling il kept going faster 
and faster and the light still in- 
dicated the second floor. In the time 
il took for the equipment Hayes 
dropped to hit the floor Ihe elevator 
was stopped and below the basement 
floor level, Hayes said. 

"I'm real afraid of going on that 
elevator with 300 to 400 pounds of 
equipment. If I didn't have louse Ihe 
elevalor and could carry the 
equipment up and down the stairs, I 
would, but you can't do thai." 

Tom Wray, assistant director of 
the physical plant, said that the 
elevators are inspected once a year 
by the state and that the Schindler- 
Haughlon Elevator Company 
performs a preventive maintenance 
check at least once a month. 

The elevators in Kelller Hall and 
flic Wall) Memorial Union are 
operated by cables, Wray said. The 
elevalor in Neff Hall is operated by 
hydrolics and can't fall like cable 
operaled elevators. Wray does not 
know of any previous elevator falls 
here. The cause of the fall was 
unknown as of Tuesday.

One half of the students who attended 
school here in 1977 did not come back 
the next year. While this sounds like an 
alarming rate of attrition, 50 percent, it 
does not mean enrollment decreased 
between (he fall semesters of 1977 and 
1978. 

According to Dean John Ulmer, 
enrollment is actually up lo percent 
from last year, bringing it to just over 
10,000 students, However, the current 
student attrition rale at IPFW is still 
high. 

Atlrition is a difficult thing to define 
and measure, said Philip Kennell, 
Director of Admissions at IPFW. 
Statistics on Ihe number of students 
leaving this campus will vary depen- 
ding on how the term is defined. Dif- 
ferent colleges define the lerm in dif- 
ferent ways, depending on what it is 
they want to measure. 

It can mean "the wearing away of the 
original numbers" of students enrolled 
a general turnover in names or a 
comparison of how many students 
remained a( the campus from one year 
to the next, said Kennell. 

Registrar Jack Dahl defined the 
textbook meaning of attrition as Ihe 
"number of students who leave 
(school) without having obtained their 
educational objectives." 

Aside from the numbers of students 
who graduate and do not return every 
year, a variety or reasons have ac- 
counted for Ihe high attrition rale here 
and at most universities. According to a 
survey conducted by IPFW in 1977, 35- 
44 percent of the students who left did so 
for financial reasons, 12 percenl left 
due lo a change in employment, 22 
percent transferred to other campuses 
and 21 percent dropped for personal 
reasons and academic failure. 

Other reasons commonly given for 
leaving include home responsibilities, 
marriage and divorce, births in the 
family, medical reasons and a general 
loss of motivation to learn. 

It is hard to measure the exact 
number of students leaving and their 
reasons lor doing so, -according lo 
Kennell and Dahl. This university does 
not require students to fill out any 
forms or attend interviews with 
campus personnel explaining their 
reasons for leaving. Students currently 
need only get the written approval of 
their advisors before departing. 

Dean Ulmer believes something can 
be done about local attrition if (he 
university is alerled lo the problem 
early enough. By concentrating more 
on attrition than new admissions, he 



thinks (he percentages could decrease. 
"Most of these things (unavoidable 
reasons for leaving) we can't do 
anything about. "If we could somehow 
identify the potential leavers earlier we 
could come up wilh intervening ser- 
vices, "said Ulmer. 

Research done al IU Indianapolis 
showed the rate of attrition decreasing 
in proportion lo the number of students 
sampled who enrolled in an in- 
troductory class about college life. 

This class offered an orientation to 
Ihe campus, provided an awareness of 
the resources available to students and 
helped them to identify career goals 
and academic programs. 

This report, compiled by Indianapolis 
personnel and in conjunction with 
Ulmer, showed the attrition rate of 
students in a particular sampling, who 
did not take the class, lo be almost 
(wice the rate of those students who did 
attend the class. 

Along with this suggested means of 
helping lower school attrition, Ulmer 
would like lo see other plans put into 
effect. A general increase in faculty 
awareness towards studenl concerns, 
expanded academic opportunilies, the 
development of career planning 
courses and programs and other 
proposals have been recommended by 

He would also like to see a plan im- 
plemented by registration time next 
fall, thai might help to t inpoinl those 
potential students leaving IPFW. If 
questions were put on Ihe registration 
cards or posted, concerning the 
likelihood of students completing their 
degrees at this campus, then the 
university could try to contact students 
who would indicate possible departure 
and might wish academic counseling. 

Because Ulmer feels that many 
students do eventually return to the 
campus and are engaged in a tem- 
porary "stopping out" rather than 
dropping out situation, this method and 
others could be used to keep in contact 
wilh students who may be leaving. 
Anymore it "is (he exception to (he 
rule," said Ulmer, "to finish (school) in 
four years," Many students, especially 
at a commuter college that is easily 
accessible to most area residents, 
extend their time in college beyond Lhe 
usual four-year period. 

By implementing plans lo identify 
students early who may prematurely 
leave school, and by keeping in touch 
with those who might come back. IPFW 
feels it can lower the attrition rate and 
keep students at the campus for a 
longer period of time.

The influenza epidemic reported 
nationally has affected Ihe IPFW 
campus as well, reports Starley Pifer. 
registered nurse and director of Health 
Services on campus. 

"In the pasi two weeks, there has 
been a definite upsurge in students and 
faculty reporting lo our clinic with flu- 
like symptoms," Pifer said. "If the 
campus were set up in a dormitory 
situation, we would be able lo be more 
accurate in our statistics." 

These flu-like symptoms are usually 
headache and sore throat followed by 
elevated temperature, muscular or 
joint pain, nausea and vomiting. 

Pifer explained that these flu cases 
cannot always be diagnosed as a cer- 
tain type of flu, mosl notably, Ihe 



Bangkok flu. because a patient must 
have a throat culture sent to the State 
Board of Health for diagnosis. One 
distinctive aspect of the Bangkok flu 
separating it from earlier global strains 
such as the Hong Kong or Asian, ap- 
pears to be (he presence of a very high 
fever, usually in the 102-104 degree 
range. 

One confirmed case of the Bangkok 
flu has been diagnosed in Ihe area. 

The flu usually runs its course in four 
to five days. Regular activity im- 
mediately following the illness is not 
recommended, because of the chances 
in getting a secondary infection, most 
commonly pneumonia or bronchitis, 
are more likely, Pifer said. 

As for prevention of the flu Pifer 
suggested slaying away from crowds 
and increasing bed rest and inlake of 



liquids "if you're not feeling well." 

"I would not advise anyone lo seek a 
vaccine against the flu at this par- 
ticular lime. While we do not know 
whether the flu season has peaked, 
immunization lakes up to six weeks 
af Ler an injection and the flu season "will 
most likely be over by Ihen," Pifer said. 
The best medication for the flu is a 
regular dose of aspirin, preferably 
every three hours, to control fever and 
warm sail water gargle lo alleviate or 
prevent a sore throat, Pifer also 
recommends restricting a diet to 
liquids and soup and staying away from 
fatty foods which are hard to digest. 

Campus health services are ad- 
ministered from Room G27 in Ihe Walb 
Memorial Union from 8 a.m. -8 p.m. 
Monday through Thursday and from 8 
a.m. -5p.m. on Friday.

Did you know exposure to cigarette 
smoke numbs (he cilia cells that line lhe 
respiratory Iracts and prevents them 
from performing the cleaning process 
Ihey were designed to do? Did you know 
thai a human felus, al one monlh of 
age, is smaller lhan a dime yet has a 
heart that pumps its own blood? 

These are among the things one can 
learn on a visit to the Harold W. 
McMillen Center for Health Education. 

The McMillen Heallh Center, which is 
new in town , is lhe second health center 
of Its kind in the nation. (The original is 
(he Robert Crown Health Center in 
Hinsdale, Illinois). The center, al 7100 
South Hanna St., is dedicaled to the 
advancement of learning in Heallh 
Education, Drug Abuse, and Life 
Begins-Family Living Education. 

The learning takes place through a 
series of programs designed lo ac- 
commodate lhe age of Ihe viewing 
audiences that visit Ihe center. All age 
groups are accommodaled, from pre- 
school lo adult, but most of the 
audiences are comprised of youlhs who 
will visit the center once each year 
through Iheir schools. 

The programs inslruct through the 



use of sophisticated visual aids, three- 
dimensional exhibits and models, and 
creative electronic devices thai 
enhance lhe expertise of an in- 
structional staff. The informalion is 
solid and factual and is presented in a 
straight-forward way so as to develop 
positive, informed, and productive 
attitudes toward physical, mental and 
emolional heallh. 

The youngest children who visit lhe 
center may learn about kindness, 
posture, and proper rest. The following 
year they may learn about the skeleton 
and proper nutrilion. And al another 
visil they may learn about lhe 
development of social relationships or 
the specialized systems of Ihe body, so 
that each visit becomes more detailed 
than the last. 

The learning process is designed lo 
allow new material to be built upon 
what was learned al the previous visit. 

Among the programs offered by the 
center is Ihe TAM, or Transparent 
Anatomical Mannikln, which is a model 
woman made of plastic. TAM's organs

"When I firsl inquired about the 
Forensic League, I was sent to Ihe 
criminal justice division," said Becky 
Niccum, half jokingly. 

Aclually the place lo inquire is in the 
communication department in Neff 
Hall, office of Janet Roncelli, facully 
advisor for the Forensic League. 

Forensics is often associated with 
criminal justice or medicine. But the 
Forensic League at IPFW isinlermsof 
deliberale speech. 

Roncelli encourages students to 
participate who wanl to improve their 
communication skills in either com- 
petitive or non-competilivc ways. 

This year is the first in several that 
the organization has had a formal and 
social struclure. "We are the only 
Purdue campus to have a learn," said 
Roncelli. 

About 12 lo 15 members meet every 
two weeks under the leadership of 
Matlhew Vokoun, execulive director. 
Many additional people participate in 
various events, which are open to all 
students. One such event is the 
preliminary rounds of the Indiana Stale 
and Peace Oratorical Contest thai 
IPFW will host Feb. 23. 

The major endeavors of the club are 
the speech tournaments and Inter- 



preter's Theater. Sandy Smilh, in- 
formation coordinator of the League, 
described the tournaments in two 
categories: public speaking and oral 
interpretation. 

Public speaking involves a prepared 
speech, written by the speaker, in a 
persuasive, informative, or en- 
tertaining classification. Extem- 
poraneous speaking Is a fourth 
classification where the contestant is 
given a current event topic jusl shortly 
before time to speak. 

"Oral interpretation is 'voice acting' 
using material (hat someone else has 
written," explained Smilh. This 
category includes classificalions of 
poelry, prose and "dramatic dual"— a 
dramatic segment from a play using 
two people. 

Interpreter's Theater, sometimes 
called Reader's Theater, uses oral 
interpretation in a non-competitive 
selling. Tryouls will be held in March 
for this spring's presentation of Wood 
Allen's short stories. "We will need 
extra people for ushers, and lo help 
wilh sets, costumes, and lights," said 
Smith. 

The Forensic group, to help support 
Iheir many activilies, will have a bagel 
sule Feb, 12, In the past the bagel sale 
has been advertised simply as a speech 
club project because of the miscon- 



ceptions over the word forensics. "We 
need to become more visible," said 
Roncelli. "We wanl lo eslablish an 
image." 

Regular and successful participation 
in Ihe tournaments may be a way to 
achieve lhal purpose. Expansion of the 
membership may be another way. 
Roncelli emphasized that the club- 
sponsored activities are open lo all 
students "whenever and wherever" 
they can parlicipale. 

The blend of academic and social 
opportunities of the League includes 
events such as lhe bowling-pizza party 
Feb. 22 at Georgetown, and the 
Forensic Fest. the ycar-cnd bash for 
both members and prospective 
members , 

Al lhe end of (he season get -togclher, 
a special presenlaiion— the annual 
"bull shooters" award— is given to the 
person who talks the most excessively 
with the leasl contenl, said Smith, 

Besides the money from projects 
such as the bagel sale, the Forensic 
League is financed from the Student 
Union Board of Governors tSUBOG), 
from the communication department, 
and special funding from ad- 
ministrative and special funding from 
administrative sources.

'Be prepared 9 
Giusti's motto 



Chancellor Joseph P. Giusti might 
have been a good Boy Scout. At least he 
practices the scout motto— Be Prepared. 

While the decision about IPFW's 
budget requests is still weeks away in 
the Indiana General Assembly, the 
Chancellor is making plans now for 
whatever the legislators decide. 

In a memo issued recently to depart- 
ment heads. Chancellor Giusti asked for 
a lisl of possible cuts that could be made 
in each department (up to 6 percent of 
each department's budget) if the IPFW 
budget request increases are denied by 
the General Assembly. 

Although such drastic cuts are not 
anticipated by the Giusti administration, 
these priority lists will help assure that 
only the departments' important budget 



items are cut— if, indeed, any cuts must 
be made. 

Chancellor Giusti has also asked for a 
list from each department head of items 
each would want added to his or her 
department's budget if more money is 
made available from the state than is 
now anticipated. 

Although few department heads want 
to admit they have expendable items in 
their departments' budgets, these lists of 
priorities will prepare Chancellor Giusti 
for making needed budget adjustment 
recommendations later this spring when 
the General Assembly decides what 
state funds IPFW will receive. 

We applaud Chancellor Giusti 's 
decision to be prepared. 



Conditions bad 



Because of 35-degree-below-zero wind- 
chill weather conditions, Monday, Feb. 
2, was an unpleasant day for all IPFW 
students. For those students with 
physical handicaps, however, the 
condition of the campus posed in- 
surmountable problems, both outside 
and inside campus buildings. 

Outside handicapped students who 
tried to go to classes were confronted 
with ice-covered parking lots and 
sidewalks. 

Although the snow removal crews 
attacked the lots and walks early in the 
day with plows to clear away the 
blowing, drifting snow, their attack on 
the ice later in the day was too little, too 
late. 



Inside, one Kettler Hall elevator was 
out of order for the day following its free- 
falling that morning with two students 
aboard. 

While a mere inconvenience to some of 
its usual passengers, the loss of the 
Kettler elevators would mean a loss of 
access to classrooms on the upper floors 
of the building to handicapped students 
who cannot use stairways. 

Until handicapped students can be 
assured of campus conditions that in- 
clude sanded, ice-free parking lots and 
sidewalks and elevators that are safe 
and dependable, IPFW cannot be con- 
sidered to be an "accessible university" 
for Hie physically handicapped.

"...if we expect professors 
to leave the ivory tower 
more oflen, they've got to be 
assured that they will be 
welcomed back," stated an 
editorial in the Journal- 
Gazette Dec. 8, 19B0. 

The editorial's main 
concern was with faculty 
involvement in community 
.'iffairs, and it interred that 
IPFW's professors may be 
unwilling to jump into 
controversy because of fear 
of reprisal from the 
heirarchy of admin- 
istrators. 

The editorial appeared 
after Ian Rolland, president 
and chief executive officer of 
Lincoln National Corp. and 
Lincoln National Life 
Company, spoke lo the 
Purdue University Faculty 
Convocation on Dec, 4. In his 
speech Rolland challenged 
IPFW's faculty to become 
more involved in community 
affairs. The editorial in- 
terpreted Holland's com- 
ment as a request for faculty 
members, to "come out of the 
ivory tower." 

Edward Nicholson, Vice 
Chancellor and Dean of 
Faculty, said that being new 
to the campus (he arrived 
last August) he would 
refrain from commenting on 
whether IPFW represses its 
faculty from becoming in- 
volved in controversial 
issues. 

However he did point out 
that involvement was an 
essentia] part of a regional 
campus. "II would be 
counter-productive to 
repress activities," 
Nicholson said.

as much insight into the 
administration as a baby

sitter has into raising 
children," he added. 

That's not right, according 
to Larry Hayes, the chief 
editorial writer for the 
Journal-Gazette. Hayes 
wrote the article and said 
that he has had a lot of 
contact with the ad- 
ministration over the years. 

Stepping out from behind 
the editorial mask, Hayes 
responded to charges that 
his article was unfair. Jerry 
Medley of University 
Relations at IPFW and Dr. 
Julius Smulkslys, acting 
dean of Arts and Letters, 
both wrote letters to the 
editor stating that the 
editorial was inaccurate. 

"The administration's 
response was an ignorant 
misreading of the editorial. 
They overreacted and 
missed the irony in it," 
Hayes said. 

He noted that the main 
issue was the degree of in- 
volvement. 

"How can we better use 
this tremendous pool of 
talent without sacrificing 
their (the faculty's) in- 
terests? Maybe we are using 
it to the utmost, but I don't 
think so," Hayes said. 

Controversial issues like 
the proposed bypass or 
Apple Glen are always open 
to more involvement, he 
said, 

But when faculty members 
get involved, it must be 
made clear whether they 
represent (he university or 
their own personal views. A 
distinction must be made to 
protect the university's 
interests, Nicholson said. 

If that distinction is a 
difficult one to make, it could 
account for why the editorial 
blamed the university's 
attitude for repressing the 
responses of its faculty 
members, 

written, but also to The 
Communicator staff. 

The Communicator 
regrets any inconvenience or 
embarrassment such 
misprints have caused. We 
can only hope that our 
readers will look upon such 
errors with a sense of humor 
and realize the errors were 
not intentional. 



We asked... 

The Communicator asked students 
what they would change if they could 
change just one thing about IPFW. 



The y said 



... 



"Nothing, except maybe traffic 
control, a more systematic way of 
handling traffic and parking— Also, 
no charge on student union pool 
tables." Joe Nouy, criminal justice 
major. 



"I would like to see more musical 
influences in the rock area for 
students, such as concerts or maybe 
local bands." Phyllis Ann Ruch, 
biology major. 





"When registering, I'd like to know 
what teacher I'm going to have, and 
how the teacher will present the 
class." L. Scabernard, non-degree 
major. 



"I'd like to see a student pub on the 
campus so some of the older students 
can have some place to relax after 
class." Tom Woodcock, business 

major.

Another of the programs is 
titled "Life Begins." 
Designed for grades five and 
up, this program tastefully 
emphasizes the miracle of 
embryonic growth and 
development leading to the 
birth of a baby. 

Some other programs 
Include "The Incredible 
Machine," "Achieving 
Maturity," "Parenting," 
and "Get High on Life." 

Dr. Ron Phillips, director 
of the center, is delighted 
with it. "Fort Wayne has 
given this center tremendous 
support, and I'm really 
pleased," he said. 
' At the Robert Crown 
Health Center, said Phillips, 
the "Get High on Life" 
program was so effective In 
leaching about the dangers 
of drinking and smoking that 
a great many youths reduced 
their uses of such sub- 
stances. 

There are three levels of 




drug program education, 
four levels of reproduction 
program education, three 
levels of children's health 
education, and two upper 
levels of health education. 

Besides learning about 
preventive health care, 
visitors also learn about 
different nerves and their 
functions, different senses 
and how they work, and 
theories of memory and 
intelligence 

The McMillen Health 
Center is open by reser- 
vation only, so if individuals 
wish to visit, they must call 
the center (at 456-4511) to 
find out when a group plans 
to be there. There is a small 
fee charged for visitation. 
(The fees are designed to 
provide for half of the 
operating income; the rest is 
provided through donations. 
The center is a non-profit 
organization. ) 

In promotion of the cen- 
ter's opening, a benefit is 



planned. The theme of the 
benefit will be "A Sound 
Mind in a Sound Body" and 
will consist of two parts. The 
first part, "Sound Mind," 
will be on Tuesday, Feb. 24 
and will include a tour of the 
Performing Arts Center, a 
reception in the gallery, and 
attendance at Ihe Civic 
Theatre's production of 
"Man of La Mancha." Ticket 
prices are S7 for adults and 
S4 for children and students. 
The second part of the 
benefit, "Sound Body," will 
be on Sunday, March i and 
will include a basketball 
tournament at Concordia 
High School in which com- 
munity figures will play. The 
Northside Wildsiders Band 
will play, and Greg Johans, 
from WPTA-TV, will an- 
nounce. Ticket prices are S5 
for adults and $3 for 
children. Tickets to both 
events can be obtained by 
calling the McMillen Health 
Center.

Band tries hard 



Benefit fails 



By STEVE R1EGEL 
Arts Editor 

In lerms of what they were 
trying to accomplish, last 
Saturday's concert by Full 
Moon at the Hilton Inn a 
benefit for Switchboard, was 
not very successful. In fact, 
according to Becky Bishton 
of Switchboard, it was a 
disaster. 

The concert drew enough 
of a crowd lo pay (or the 
room at the Inn, but the net 
proceeds fell S20 short of 
paying for (he band Full 
Moon donated this $20, but 
because of the cost of 
printing flyers, Switch- 
board ended up losing 
money. The only people who 
really benefited from the 
concerl were the band and 
those who came to see them. 

Although it was small, the 



crowd that showed up in 
support of Switchboard was 
more of a mixed group than 
the fans who went lo the Full 
Moon concert at Artlink two 
weeks ago. This is good for 
the band because they need a 
wider exposure. As avowed 
non-sexists, Full Moon has a 
loyal following among local 
feminists, but their appeal is 
really much broader. Their 
music is relevant to 
everyone. 

Full Moon's music defies 
description. It is sort of a 
mixture of folk music and 
progressive rock with jazz 
overtones. The sound is 
many textured and uses a lot 
of rhythms, None of the 
members is an exceptional 
musician, but they play as an 
ensemble very well. Their 
ngements have some 



unexpected and demanding 
changes and some unusual 
harmonies, which they keep 
tight and clean. 

Individually, Rose Lazoff's 
bass is solid and funky, and 
stands out as one of the 
driving forces of the band. 
Lynne Ostergren's 

keyboards contribute to the 
fullness of the sound while 
Jane Palajac and David 
Miller come up with some 
nice dual leads on guitar. 
Nearly everyone in the band 
sings, providing some in- 
teresting layers to the 
vocals. 

Full Moon's songs, 
mostly written by members 
of the band, express a wide 
rang of emotions, including 
self-reliance, shared ten- 
derness, .and intelligently 
assimilated outrage. While 
several of their songs, such 
as "Half Price," written by 
Jill and Jane Palajac, are 
directly related to the op- 
pression of women by this 
society, many of them 
contain sentiments . that 
could apply to anyone, A 
good ' example is _R^&lt; 
Lazoff's "Black and Blue," a 
song about taking abuse 
from a lover. 

Full Moon's sound system 
is excellent and their sound 
very' professional. 
Everything is clean and 
balanced. It would be nice if 
they had a betler light set- 
up, however. Full Moon has 
been playing around the Fort 
Wayne area for about a year. 
If they 
the endeavor as they 

they sould 
achieve a wider 

discover thai this band has 
something new to offer. 



examines the night life in 
Fort Wayne. 

This week the Com- 
municator takes a peek at 
three bars lhal seem lo share 
some common ground: 
O'Sullivan's, Mother's, and 
Our Place. What these pubs 
have in common is novel 
atmosphere. 

O'Sullivan's, ldOBW. Main. 
is probably the world's only 
Irish-Italian pub. The decor 
is great. The walls are 
covered with a complete 
menagerie of knick knacks. 
The bar room is fairly small, 
but there is a large back 
room to accommodate the 
huge weekend crowds. 

O'Sullivan's has one of (he 
wildest juke boxes I've ever 
seen, The music ranges from 
old fifties and sixties tunes to 
Bing Crosby stuff and a 
bunch of oldies like "When 
the moon hits your eye like a 
hig pizza pic..." and so on. 
That kind of stuff is okay lor 
a while, but after about three 
or four hours it starts to 
grate on my nerves. 

Offering one of the widest 



selections of imported beers 
In the city, I believe that 
O'Sullivan's is the only local 
bistro that has the big 28 
ounce cans of Foster's Lager 
on the shelves regularly. 

The only problem with 
O'Sullivan's is that the 
regular crowd is just that, 
regular. Friday is □ good 
night for the newcomer. 

Overall, O'Sullivan's is a 
good time, the atmosphere is 
pleasant and the prices are 
reasonable. On the old scale 
of one lo ten, O'Sullivan's 
comes in with an even six. 

Located in a building (hal 
Is preserved as one of the 
city's historical landmarks, 
Mother's, on the Landing, 
has one of the most in- 
teresting interior designs 
I've ever seen. Along the 
upper half of (he west wall is 
a display of antique stained 
glass (hat rivals that of our 
local churches. 

Don't get the idea thai 
Mother's is a quiet, subdued 
little pub, though. 

Mather's would have (o 
be labeled as a blues bar. 
Many limes (here are (wo 
bands playing at once, an 
electric band upstairs and an 
acoustic musician down- 
stairs in the Speakeasy. 




When (here is no live music, 
Mother's has an extremely 
reliable juke box loaded with 
good old rock 'n roll. 

Pitchers of beer are over- 
priced at $5. but mixed 
drinks are a steal. Served in 
beer mugs, drinks are strong 
and the cost is a nominal 
St. SO. The popcorn is free 
and after 11 p.m. has a 
(endaney to be thrown rather 
Ihan eaten. 



Mother's is a great place to 
rid yourself of the Friday 
night rowdies, and on our 
scale gets a whopping nine. 

Our Place, in the 
Marketplace of Canterbury, 
runs a close second to 
Mother's. Looking a lot like 
an outdoor cafe, Our Place 
offers a variety of munchies 
that is unbeatable. 

Mixed drinks are average, 
priced around the two dollar 



mark. Beer is the buy here. 
The immense mugs of eilher 
Little Kings or Lowenbrau 
dark are only $1.25. 

The chairs are padded and 
very comfortable. In back 
are a collection of arcade 
games and a juke box that is 
easily the best in (own. 

Our Place comes across 
the finish line at eight and a

By GRETCHEN

Slafr Writer 

Rod Stewart has definitely 
calmed down, and it shows in 
his latest album, "Foolish 
Behavior." 

After "Blondes Have More 
Fun," a hard work to follow, 
"Foolish Behavior" is a 
refreshing change. The 
change is big, and relates to 
Stewart's family life. With 
the addition of a wife, Alana, 
two wee ones, and one more 
on the way, his music was 
bound to change. 

There are some 
similarities between 
"Blondes" and "Foolish 
Behavior." Rod Stewart has 
always been very sensual, or 
one might say sexual, in his 
lyrics. The sexual overtones 
may not be as blatant as in 
"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy," but 
"Passion." from the new 
album, is a much better song 
with much more depth. 

Stewart has a long and 
successful history. Once a 
member of a band called The 
Small Faces, later just The 
Faces, he played for several 
years with people like Jeff 
Beck and Ron Wood. Later 
he drifted more and more 
towards solo work. In the 
early 70's, his talent was al 
its peak with "Every Picture 



Tells a Story," and such 
tender singles as "Maggie 
May," and Neil Young's 
"Tonight's The Night." 

Then the albums stopped 
selling, and until 1978 he 
wasn't doing as well. At this 
point, disco swept the nation, 
Stewart went along with it, 
and "Blondes Have More 
Fun" went Platinum. 
Fortunately, "Foolish 
Behavior" does not go to the 
same extremes in disco, and 
although it is vibrant, It is 
much more consistent. 

"Foolish Behavior" is an 
intimate piece for Stewart. 
The songs "My Girl" and 
"Oh God I Wish I Were Home 
Tonight" represent a 
revelation in his life. The 
album drags a bit, reflecting 
the fact that his life has 
slowed down somewhat also. 
However, his backing band 
is excellent, providing the 
album with some spice. 

The album is a must, and 
regardless of the method, the 
results went very well. He 
really puts his heart into it. 
Although he keeps his wallet 
In mind, rock and roll is a 
multi-billion dollar business, 
political and commercial, 
and we feel it in every form 
and walk of life. So who's to 
deny Stewart a little foolish

Men disa ppointed 

Tuskers edged 



PAGE6 — THE COMMUNICATOR — FEBRUARY 5. 1981 



ByELLIEWOLLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The irnil of disap- 
pointment following Ihe 
men's basketball team con- 
tinues as the team dropped 
two more games, leaving the 
Tuskers with a seven-game 
losing streak. 

After five defeats on the 
road, the 1PFW team got 
cheated out of a returning 
home victory Jan. 28 as 
Goshen edged out the 
Tuskers in one of the tightest 
games of the season. 

In the first half, even 
though IPFW outplayed 
Goshen, neither team 
displayed any impressive 
moves. But before the first 
hair ended, a bit of the true 
Tusker style and ability 
could be spot ted as the action 
became more energetic. 

"We seemed to be a little 
more alert with our game," 
said Head Coach Ken Work- 
man. "We began forcing 
turnovers on Goshen's part 
and took advantage of 

With a half-time IPFW 

lead of 26-33, the Tusker 
spurt didn't last long. As the 
Tuskers lost momentum." 
Goshen took on a stronger 
appearance. 

"We were loo passive," 
said Workman "We let them 
back into the game with 
some scoring inside, where 
we broke down and lost our 
aggression." 



With eight minutes to play 
and Goshen leading 50-19, the 
Tuskers still put up a decent 
fight causing the lead to 
move back and forth be- 
tween the two teams until the 
clock ran out with a score of 
59-S9. 

Goshen's aggressive play 
wrapped it up in overtime as 
the Tuskers lost 73-71. 

Rickie Smith topped the 
Tusker scoring with 26 
points, followed by Ron 
Bojrab hitting 12. and Scott 
Norris adding 10. 

In the second loss, the 
Tuskers met their city 
rivals, Indiana Tech, once 
again last Saturday, in what 
Workman described as a 
"disappointing, flat per- 
formance." 

Workman said the IPFW 
team did not match its 
performance at the Sertoma 
Tourney, Dec. 5-6, where the 
Tuskers outshot Indiana 
Tech for a win 

The teams had a com- 
petitive exchange until 
midway through the first- 
half when the Tuskers began 
a rapid decline. 

"We started to force the 
basketball against Indiana 
Tech's full-court pressure," 
Workman said. "We played 
as if we had never played 
against full-court pressure 
before."

Players return to 
join 'big boys' 

By JENS M. SORENSEN 
Staff Writer 

The unwanted stepchild has gotten an invitation to 
the ball. The Ohio State Volleyball Invitational, that is. 
IPFW, long toiling in the shadows of its parent in- 
stitutions, is playing ball with the big boys. And that's 
something neither I.U, nor Purdue can say — at least 
in men's volleyball. 

The Tusker volleyball team opens its second season 
of varsity competition Friday at the 10-team OSU 
Invitational. The tournament is divided into two five- 
team brackets, with each school playing all the others 
within its bracket. The two teams with the best records 
in each bracket will then advance to the finals. 

The Tuskers will face Ball State, Pittsburgh, Cin- 
cinnati and the University of Winnipeg (Canada). 
Competing in the other bracket are Ohio State, Ten- 
nessee, Toledo. Kellogg Community College and 
George Mason, an East Coast power. 

Coach Arnie Ball has four lettermen back from last 
season, including two who have played for two seasons 
Juniors Paul Wyss, 6 feel 4, and 6-2 Colin Leiter both 
played two years ago when men's volleyball was just a 
club sport. Both Wyss and Leiter played for Ball at 
Paul Harding High School, as did junior letterman Dan 
Scott, 6-2, and 5-11 freshman Joe Hammons. The other 
letterman is 6-2 sophomore Matt Heller from Leo. 

Newcomers to Ihe squad include a pair of freshmen 
from New Haven. 6-t Pat Menzie and 6-2 Chris Cole ; 6-2 
junior Steve Miller from Bishop Luers High School; 
and Dave Waters, a 5-10 freshman from Northside 
High School. 

Seven of the team members, including all four let- 
termen, have played high school volleyball. 

Harding, New Haven and Leo are members of the 
East Allen County Boy's Volleyball Conference, along 
with Woodlan and Heritage. It is one of only two boy's 
volleyball conferences in the stale, Ball said, the other 
being a group ol small schools near Valparaiso. 

Coach Ball is still looking for more men to tryout for 
Ihe squad. Though seven of the team members are 6 
feet 2 or taller, height is not a prerequisite for 
volleyball. Ball said. The shorter players are usually 
rotated into the backline as setters, servers and 
defensive specialists. 



34 at half-time, Workman 
summed up the second-half 
as a complete domination by 
Indiana Tech. "Wegaveupa 
lol of easy baskets because 
we did nol gel back quickly 
enough on defense," Work- 
man said. 

Indiana Tech continued to 
pull away from the 
struggling Tuskers and 
dumped the IPFW team 104- 
78. The Tuskers, however, 
still scored three in double- 
figures with Gary Bush 
hitting for 20 points, and 
Kendall Murphy and Smith 
each adding 18. 

The Tuskers are 
weathering hard times at the 
moment, and Workman feels 
(his is partly due to a lack of 
player self-motivation. 

"The players had 
seemingly reached the peak 
of their own personal ob- 
jectives back in Dec.," 
explained Workman. "As a 
result, they have not sethijh 
enough goals for themselves 
to keep them going. The 
team doesn't understand 
what success really 
requires." 
As to the immediate future 

Workman said, "We have 
players that are just 

spinning their wheels and it's 

time to park it." 

With a season record of 7- 

12, the Tuskers were to have 

met DePauwon Tuesday.

The IPFW girls basketball 
Learn suffered through its 
ninth and tenth consecutive 
losses last week. On Thurs- 
day night , Coach Peggy 
Voisin's crew had a 60-59 
lead over Manchester 
College with 2 minutes to go 
in the game, but some 
shoddy play allowed Man- 
chester to escape with a 71-62 
victory. 

Commenting on ihe late 
game collapse Voisin said. 
"we just didn't keep our cool 
in the last two minutes." 

The game was close all Ihe 
way as Manchester led by 
only four points at the half. 
35-31. Amy Brunow and Kim 
Hoimann led IPFW with 15 
points apiece. Karen Dir- 
ckson and Sue Hendricks 
added lOpolnts apiece. 

Saturday the girls squad 
went to Huntington. buL an 
all too familiar result oc- 



curred. The team bowed to 
Huntington College 71-61. 
This time it was first half 
problems thai did them In, as 
they trailed at the in- 
termission 32-22. The second 
half was a different story. A 
balanced scoring attack 
enabled IPFW to stay even 
with Huntington, as both 
teams scored 39 points in the 
second half. It wasn't enough 
though as the team went 
down to its tenth consecutive 
loss. 

Kim Heimann led the 
Tuskers with 17 points and 
Kathleen Smith added 13 
points. 

Coach Voisin thinks she 
knows why the team has 
been having such a disap- 
pointing season. Voisin said, 
"Many gomes Just a couple 
of the girls have good games 
and the rest of ihe team has a 
hard time putting it together. 
We have to find team con- 
sistency."

Saturday's trip to Can- 
nonsburg, sponsored by 
SUBOG, was considered by 
most skiers along to be a 
complete success. 

As the buses rolled out of 
the circle drive in front of 
Walb Memorial Union, it was 
fairly obvious that many of 
Ihe -people along were not 
familiar with rising at 6 in 
the morning in the pursuit of 
sport. In any event, most of 
bus number 82's passengers, 
excluding a few early 
morning rowdies land I 
think we know who we are), 
slept for the better part of 
the journey to the ski area 
near Grand Rapids. 

Upon arrival at Can- 
nonsburg, the skiers, most of 
them beginners, although 
there were a few seasoned 
veterans along, were awake 
and refreshed. We piled out 
of the bus and made our 
way to the lodge to get lilt 
tickets and rental equip- 
ment. That taken care of, we 
hit the slopes 

Conditions were fairly 
good despite warm weather 
the previous week. Can- 
nonsburg has enough snow 
making equipment to 
adequately make up for a 



111 1 1.: 



of lost 



Its 



drawbacks though, it has a 
lendancy to be a little mealy 
and it also turns from snow 
into ice towards the end of 
the day. 

Far be it that a little ice 
would stop our crew. They 
went at it like true cham- 
pions. Even counting the 
occasional stops at the 
delightful Cannonsburg bar, 
many of the beginners 
showed marked im- 
provement as the afternoon 

The true star of the day 
was Bill, our bus driver. As 
the weary members of our 
group situated themselves 
on the bus for the return trip, 
Bill saved the day. As if he 
were reading our minds. Bill 
announced that the first stop 
would be at a liquor store. 
The cheers were thunderous. 
But the kicker was the ec- 
static look on the face of the 
proprietor of the liquor store 
as three bus loads of thirsty 
skiers cleaned her out of 
beer. 

The trip home was nearly 
as enjoyable as the time 
spent at Cannonsburg. We 
drank our beers and ex- 
changed stories, most of 
them pretty funny, about the 
events of the day. We arrived 
home at about 11:30 and 
went our separate ways.
