Retraction 



Deadly Deceits 

McGehee discloses CIA secrets 



According to Athlelic's secretary Marcia Tuttle, the Oct. 1 issue of 
The Communicator incorrectly stated IPFW athletes have "school-paid 
Canterbury Green apartments."' The Communicator regrets the error. 



Perhaps one of the most shocking 
lectures ever given at IPFW was held 
on Thursday. Oct. I, by former Cen- 
tral Intelligence Agency Operations 
Director Ralph McGehee. 

His discourse, which consisted of a 
summary of the events described in 
his book, "Deadly Deceits: My 25 
Years m the CIA," was sponsored by 
SUBOG, the Three Rivers chapter of 
the Vietnam Veterans of America, the 
IPFW Global Studies Center, and the 
Fort Wayne International Affairs 
Forum. 

McGehee started out by explaining 
how any evidence thai he uses to sup- 
port his bold claims must be a matter 
of public record in order to get past 
the CIA Secrecy Act. the purpose of 
which is to halt the publication of 
classified information. Therefore, in 
order to publish anything concerning 
U S covert operations, an author has 
to prove that his material is "within 
the public domain." 

After the introduction, McGehee 
gave a brief synopsis of his personal 
history. He was careful to point out 
that he grew up in what some his- 
torians refer lo as the McCarthy era, 
in which America's anti-communist 
beliefs came to an apex. 

He went lo Notre Dame University 
on a football scholarship, and played 
on (our undefeated teams. Although 
McGehee signed up to play with the 
Green Bay Packers, he was cut before 
he had a chance to play. 

The CIA then recruited him as well 
as other "rejects from the NFL" (or 
paramilitary work. He served in the 
agency's covert arm (or 25 years, 
doing tours of duty in Japan, the 
Philippines. Taiwan, Thailand and 
Vietnam. He received many unit and 
individual commendations from both 
the CIA and the Defense Department 
as well as a distinguished service and 
two Vietnam service medals. He 
worked on "Deadly Deceits" for three 
years, although it took two more to be 
allowed to publish it. 

Since then, McGehee has been tour- 
ing the globe lo promote his book. He 
has been a witness at Congressional 
and public hearings. His most recent 
testimony was given at the Abby 
Hoffman-Amy Carter trial in 
Massachusetts, 

The CIA, accordmg to McGehee, has 
been conducting covert operations 
almost since its conception. "Covert 
Operations," he remarked, "are 
something like the sex act— there are 
only so many ways you can do 
things." In (act, he claims that the 
pattern is so distinct that anyone can 
predict a government's downifall if he 
or she can recognize the signs. 

For instance, McGehee recently 
went on a (act- fin ding mission to the 
Philippines and learned that "they 
tthe CIA) are indeed involved in 
counter-insurgency operations. ..and 
the effort is escalating." He went on to 
assert that the Philippines could very 
well become the next Vietnam. 

The CIA's involvement in the 
Vietnam War was the mam topic in 
the lecture because it "epitomized the 
agency's role around the world." Over 
a period of approxirnately five years, 
McGehee discovered that America's 
miUtary involvement in the Vietnam 
War was due to a (ailed CIA covert 
operation. The beginning of this 
private investigation started with a 
six-year assignment to Thailand. 

in the early sixties, the U.S. learned 
that Thailand had elements of 
communist insurgency. With the rest 
of the area aflame with war, the CIA 
became very concerned that another 
southeast Asian country would become 
communist. McGehee was assigned lo 
uncover the insurgents within Thai- 
land in 1965 According to the CIA's 
National Intelligence Estimate INIE) 
on Thailand, the country's communist 
party consisted entirely of "2,000 
guerillas" who lived in the mountains 
and terrorized the villagers In the 
valleys. 

At first, his programs were met with 



little success, as epitomized by "a 19- 
helicopter raid on an empty rice 
deld." Practice makes perfect, how- 
ever, and soon he arrived at a better 
method. Through isolated interro- 
gations, his team found an old man 
who admitted to being a communist. 
Each interrogation told him the same 
thing. 

A few years before McGehee's ar- 
rival. Vietnamese officers had told the 
villagers that their government con- 
sisted of the vicious imperialists. If 
the Thai joined up with 3 communist 
liberation association, then the day 
would come when the people would 
unite as one: tear down the govern- 
ment; expel the foreigners Ithe 
Americans); and a new communist 
government would rule, which would 
insure that everyone has as equal 
share of land, food, etc. 

His success led lo many things. At 
first he and his group received "the 
highest accolades." McGehee received 
commendations from both the CIA and 
the U.S. defense department Then in 
1967. McGehee's section chief 
cancelled his incredibly successful 
program and called him back to the 
CIA's headquarters, Langley Air 
Force Base. This event he would later 
call "the beginning of ttie end." 

Once he arrived at Langley, an irate 
McGehee tried to rally support for the 
reinitiation of his operation. Not only 
was the program not reinstated, he 
was reprimanded for his efforts. 
Curious, he found the new NIE on 
Thailand. It said there were "two 
thousand guerillas" in the mountains 
who terrorize the villages below them. 
However, his operation had shown 
that not only were the villagers not 
being terrorized, they were openly 
supporting and cooperating in tar 
greater numbers than listed Yet the 
NIE remained the same at least since 
1965, i.e., the CIA was lying. Over the 
course of the next few years. McGehee 
found that the CIA was lying to the 
media, the Pentagon, and the 
President. 

This discovery caused a complete 
ideological breakdown within him. 
McGehee admitted he "thought the 
only option for me was to kill myself " 
He had discovered that his program 
had been cancelled in order to protect 
the "charade of murder" in Vietnam. 

In 1959. the NIE on Vietnam said 
that the entire commimist party of 
Vietnam consisted entirely of "2,000 
guerillas" with no popular support in 
villages After the Thet offenssive, the 
1968 NIE reported there were 600,000 
guerillas with no popular support in 
the villages. 

Also in 1968, the Farmers' Commu- 
nist Liberation Association of Vietnam 
claimed a membership of seven 
million people. According to the 
agency, the association did not exist; 

These estimates, all of which are 
available to the public, made 
McGehee realize that "if we ever had 
to tell the truth about., .Thailand, then 
we'd have to tell the truth about the 
Communist Party of Vietnam." 

The effects of this charade were 
evident in the infamous Thet offensive 
of 1968. At the time, the U.S. had 
about a half million troops and seven 
hundred CIA case officers in Vietnam. 
McGehee described Thet as an event 
where "the whole countrj-side rose up 
as if one, completely unreported on by 
the CIA, and occupied every 
(militarily significant! city and town 
in Vietnam." This was the beginning 
of the end for America's war effort. 

After returning from his two-year 
tour in Vietnam, McGehee became an 
"agitator." He continually questioned 
agents, chiefs, and his superiors. As a 
result he received a desk job with 
very little importance, a sort of "CIA 
Siberia." Then after 25 years, he re- 
tired. At this point, McGehee gave his 
concludingremarks, 

VIETNAM: In 1954, the French had 
been defeated at Diem Bien Phu It 
was decided at a Geneva Conference 
that the border would be nullified (or 
300 days, allowing anyone in the north 
to move south fand vice versa. After 
two years, the nation would be reuni- 
ted by a national election. 



In order lo protect U.S. business in- 
terests in the area, "the CIA was 
ordered to create noneommunist al- 
ternative government in South 
Vietnam" which would be imposed 
over the Vietnamese and would deny 
the presence of a strong communist 
following. They encouraged Catholics 
from the north to move by distributing 
a forced North Vietnamese document 
sUting that all Catholics in North 
Vietnam would be violently persecuted 
once the elections ended. 

Then the CIA rigged the election 
results, placing their chosen man. 
Diem (a Catholic), as ruler of 
Vietnam. Eisenhower later wrote that 
80 percent of the Vietnamese would 
have voled (or the communist, Ho Chi 
Minh. The CIA controlled the country 
until 1964, when some of the power 
was given to the military via "Oper- 
ation Switchback." 

After Diem's assassination, the CIA 
reasoned that there was only one way 
lo keep the area open to U.S. com- 
mercial interest— open military in- 
volvement. In order to justify this 
action, the CIA claimed that North 
Vietnam had invaded South Vietnam 
in 1954 (which, according to McGehee, 
was entirely untrue). Then "the 
agency loaded up a Vietnamese' junk 
with communist weapons, ammu- 
nitions, demolitions; forged some 
documents; floated it down the coast 
of South Vietnam; shot it up., and the 
media said 'here's proof of the 



COVERT OPERATIONS: Vietnam 
is the epitome of all CIA operations 
globally. The agency has covert oper- 
ations in Angola, El Salvador. 
Nicaragua, Afganistan, and the 
Philippines to name just a few. All of 
these projects fall into one of the four 
types of warfare: economic , pohtieal, 
psychological, or paramilitary. The 
Church committee report on Ihe CIA 



in 1975 said that "the agency, in a 14- 
year period, conducted 900 major 
covert operations and thousands of 
smaller lonesl." 

DOMESTIC OPERATIONS: The 
CIA is, by law, not allowed to conduct 
activities within the United States. 
The CIA has employed '"approxi- 
mately five thousand academicians" 
employed to look for possible CIA 
recruits and write essays of papers 
benevolent to the CIA. 

MEDIA OPERATIONS: The 1975 
House o( Representative report on the 
agency stated that '"media propa- 
ganda is the major activity of the 
CIA." Their great propaganda ma- 
chine is known within the company as 
"'the Mighty Wurlitier." The Wurlitzer 
is a secret international network 
within the media that publishes stories 
written for or by the CIA and sup- 
presses any article that the agency 
wants covered up. At one lime, the 
U.S section of the Mighty Wurlitzer 
employed approximately 400 news- 
people, from the publisher of "The 
New York Times" to local reporters, 

GRENADA: The only purpose of Ihe 
invasion of Grenada was to boost 
Reagan's popularity. In the first two 
days of the invasion. American media 
was not allowed on the island. The 
reason tor this was to allow the CIA 
time enough lo plant Communist 
weapons, A TV producer who had 
smuggled himself in confided in 
McGehee that the Americans were 
shelling barren hills in order to make 
news reels which would be distributed 
to the press. 

Nole: The contents of this article 
are so startling to its author that he 
feels that he musl stress that the in- 
formation given above was either an 
opinion made by McGehee or a direct 
reference to publically available data.

Gregory accepts two 
student resignations 

DAVID N. BENSON 

Staff Writer 

A disagreement with President Kurt Gregory has led to the resignation ot 

secretary of the Student Senate Wioona Peters and Students' Govemmeot 

Treasurer James McCarthy III. 

The disagreement occurred on the morning of Wednesday, Sepl. 23, when 
Peters was typing the paperwork for that night's senate meeting. Included in the 
agenda was a bill sponsored by Senator Pete Groves to honor former Viee- 
Chancellor Edward Nicholson which Groves requested be kept secret. Noitetbe- 
less, Gregory insisted Peters reveal the contents of the bill. After Peters repeat- 
edly refused, Kurt Gregory said "You just remember who does the hiring and 
firing around here." , „ 

Peters resigned the next week. While her reslgnaUon mentions only un- 
foreseen changes within my working environment," Peters stated In an interview 
last Monday that Gregory's remark was the main cause of her resignation 
although she had other minor grievances. 

Gregory's treatment of Peters also appears to have caused McCarthys de- 
parture. In his letter of resignation, McCarthy cites Gregory as "being unable to 
satisfactorily settle your confUct with Winn Peters. resulUng from your threat to 
her job, and questioning of her Iftyally to you." The resipiaUon concludes: "An 
appointed position means that that person is the best one (or the job. You seem lo 
feel that it means that one must cower to your wishes. 1 will not." 

While the resignation suggests that McCarthy would reconsider if Gregory 
made amends to Peters, Gregory said in an interview last Wednesday that he 
considers the matter '"resolved," and thai he has "done no wrong." and he has no 
further quarrel with Pelere. In announcing her reslgnaUon, Gregory called Peters 
"a valuable resource," Gregory also said in the interview that replacements for 
the pair will be named at the next Senate meeting. 

In an unrelated development. Senator Pete Groves has been replaced with 
Senator Tim Smith as chair of the Studenl Senate's IPFW Independence C«m- 
mittee. The move occurred at the Wednesday. Sept, 30. meeting when Senator 
Kris Maly pointed out the fact that the committee and its chair had not been 
formally approved by the body as required by the consdtuUon. Vice President 
Phil Downs agreed and submitted the committee to a vote. 

After Ihe senate ratified the committee. Downs then asked (or a motion lo seat 
Groves as chair. The motion, introduced by Senator Terry Granahan, failed 9^. 
Downs then submitted commillee-member Tim Smilh as chair, which the body 
passed unanimously. 

Groves had an excused absence from the meeting but said in an Interview 
Thursday. Oct- 1, he "had no problems" working wilh Tim Smith but said Maly's 
motion reflected "personal bias" against him. 

Maly, in an interview Monday, Oct. 5, denied Groves' charge and said she was 
merely correcting ""a technical violation of the constitution."' 

Finally, Marian Adair, serving as acting advisor to Students' Government 
encouraged students to attend the opening of the new weight-room In the athletic 
center. The opening will be hosted by ChanceUor Tom Wallac*. "\Ve can Up-loe 
wilh Tom," Adair said. 

The Student Senate did not meet Wednesday, Sept. 30, due to (all break.

Thundav, Ociobtr IS. 1967 



Sexual harassment: Is it 
still prevalent today? 



Girls, gals, chicks, broads, 
dames.,, all of these terms mean 
the same thing. Thev are degrading 
nouns intended to identify a human 
female. 

Now. of course, one rarely hears 
the word "dame" in casual con- 
versation: such blatant sex dis- 
crimination is not in vogue. Unfor- 
tunately this does not mean sex 
discrimination is no longer preva- 
lent in today's society; it is simply 
more subtle. 

A man does not need to menace a 
woman physically to intimidate 
her. Merely threatening a woman 
with the toss of her job or the 
lowering of her grade is enough to 
coerce some women into 
submission. 

The submission inhibits change 
and only breeds fear and repressed 
anger in the woman. It is im- 
possible for women to achieve 
equality if men continue to view 
females as second class citizens. 

Sexual harassment, however, is 
not the only way a man can assert 
his dominance over women. There 
is also gender harassment. 

For example, a case of gender 
harassment would be if a male 
math professor asked a woman 
what sne was doing in his class 
because "everyone knows girls 
can't do math." 

What does a woman do when 
faced with this kind of 
discrimination. 

Fight it. 

No woman should allow herself to 
be pummeled into submission, 
Everytime a man assaults a 
woman physically or mentally he is 
robbing her of her self-respect and 
worth. 



Teachers and bosses are not the 
only ones who practice harassment. 
In Shere Hite's book. "Women and 
Love," she states that 95% of the 
women in her study reported being 
emotionally and psychologically 
harassed by their husbands. 

Just because one is not actively 
engaged in harassment does not 
mean that one does not condone it. 
Merely sitting there doing nothing 
while a woman is harassed makes 
one just as much at fault as the 
aggressor. 

The case qf.Vivienne Rabidue vs. 
Osceola Refining Company, as re- 
ported by syndicated columnist 
Carl Rowan, is a sad reminder of 
how the courts deal with the har- 
assment of women. 

Rabidue filed several complaints 
against another Osceola employee, 
Douglas Henry, for remarks he 
made, including a remark directed 
at Rabidue stating that, "All that 
bitch needs is a good lay." 

The courts noted, "Henry was an 
extremely vulgar and crude in- 
dividual who customarily made 
obscene comments about women 
generally, and. on occasion, direc- 
ted such obscenities to (RabidueJ." 

The courts decided, however. 
that Rabidue could not prove "that 
she suffered some degree of injury 
as a result of the abusive and hos- 
tile work environment," 

Which brings up another ques- 
tion: What does a woman have to 
do to prove that she's suffered in- 
jury due to a man's careless 
treatment of her? And to whom 
does she need to prove this? 

A man? Herself? The courts? 

It is past time to put a stop to 
sexual and gender harassment. 



Self-reliance can be taught 



The only real "experts" on hun- 
ger are hungry people, and their 
hunger is caused by poverty. On 
World Food Day, 1987. the agencies 
of the Interfaitn Hunger Appeal 
(IHA) ask you to reflect on this 
statement and support activities 
that enable people to lift them- 
selves from the conditions that 
deny them access to food. 

The problem of hunger cannot be 
solved by giving away food, al- 
though that may also be necessary 
in times of emergency. Rather, 
hunger will diminish only when 
those in need have the purchasing 
power and the opportunities to 
grow or buy their own food— in 
other words to become self-reliant. 
All too often the social and econom- 
ic growth of societies is achieved at 
the expense of those who are most 
in need. The benefits of growth 
must be spread broadly among all 
sectors of society. 

Removing barriers to develop- 
ment and helping to create op- 
portunities allows for the remark- 
able resourcefulness, wisdom and 
skills of capable people to flourish- 



Sharing experiences and con- 
clusions, the agencies of IHA re- 
spond to specific needs by ac- 
icnowledging and building on the 
talents and customs of their part- 
ners in the developing world. 

You may be thinking, "But what 
can I do? I am only one person," 
You can do more than you think by 
(1) understanding the problems 
and causes of hunger and actively 
involving yourself in the develop- 
ment of public policies thai address 
these injustices, (2) organizing or 
joining campus groups that inform 
and motivate others to a better 
understanding of global hunger and 
(3) upon graduation, involving your 
corporation, community, and reli- 
gious organizations in efforts that 
will make the lives of some 500 
million people more humane. 

What can you do? You can do a 
great deal by keeping informed and 
involved.

Appeal. 



To the Editor 



To Ihe Editor: 

During President 
Ehrlich's visit here on Sept, 
21, several (acuity voiced 
their perceptions Ihal IPFW 
students and faculty were 
"second-class citizens" in 
the lU system. "Oh, no," 
the president replied, "we 
are one," I'd like to offer 
the President two library- 
related examples of why we 
may perceive we are sec- 
ond^lass citizens: 

The Big Ten Universiti^, 
along with the Univereity of 
Chicago, have signed an 
agreement allowing faculty 
at these institutions to use 
the others' libraries. Fac- 
ulty may even check out 
materials. Apparently the 
"we are one" concept didn't 



phase either lU or Purdue. 
Both signed the agreement 
knowing full well it ex- 
cluded regional campus 
faculty. 

Earlier this year 
Purdue's Engineering Li- 
brary announced to the 
press its EIS, Engineering 
Information Service. Ac- 
cording to information re- 
ported in a local newspaper 
any citizen of the state 
could call the library for an 
account number that would 
allow access into the EIS 
database which is the online 
card catalog. When the 
IPFW Library applied for 
an account we were em- 
phatically turned down with 
an explanation that this is a 



stale-funded database "for 
Indiana citizens only " So 
far as the Engineering Li- 
brary IS concerned we are 
not second-class citizens. 
Indeed, we aren't even citi- 
zens! So much for the "we 
are one" theory 

Obviously, it is not 

enough for (tie Presidents to 

tell us that "we are one," It 

would be nice if they also 

emphasized this point to the 

people on the "main" 

campuses. Perhaps then we 

would not have these 

strange perceptions that we 

are "second-class citizens."

National Research Council offers associateships 



The National Research 
Council announces the I9S8 
Resident. Cooperative, and 
Postdoctoral Research As- 
soc jateship Programs for 
research in the sciences 
and engineering to t)e con- 
ducted in behalf of 2S fed- 
eral agencies or research 
institutions, whose latmr- 
atories are located 
throughout the United 
States 

The programs provide 
PhD scientists and engi- 
neers of unusual promise 
and abilit-y with op- 
portunities to perform re- 
search on problems largely 
of their own choosing yet 
compatible with the re- 
search interests of the 
supporting laboratory 

Initialed in 1954. the As- 
sociateship Programs have 
contributed to the career 
development of over 5000 
scientists ranging from re- 
cent Ph.D. recipients to 
distinguished senior 
scientists. 

Approximately -150 new 
full-time Associateships will 
be awarded on a com- 



petitive 



in 1988 for 
chemistry, 
earth and atmospheric sci- 
ences; engineering and 
applied sciences; biologi- 
cal, health, behavioral sci- 
ences and biotechnology; 
mathematics; space and 
planetary sciences, and 
physics. Most of the pro- 
grams are open to both U.S. 
and non-US. nationals, and 
to both recent Ph.D degree 
recipients and senior 
investigators. 

Awards are made for one 
or two years; senior appli- 
cants who have held the 
doctorate at least five years 
may request shorter tenure. 
Annual stipends for recent 
Ph D.'s for the 1988 pro- 
gram year will vary from 
$27,150 to $35,000, depending 
upon the sponsoring labor- 
atory, and will be appro- 
priately higher for senior 
Associates. 

Applications to the Na- 
tional Research Council 
must be postmarked no

Ramanujan's works presented 



On Monday. Oct. 19. at 
noon in Kelller 247. the 
Purdue-Indiana Mathe- 
matical Sciences Club will 
present a special talk by 
Professor Bruce Berndt of 
the University of Illinois, 
entitled 'Ramanujans 
Notebooks," Ramanujan is 
one of the greatest mathe- 
maticians of India, and 
certainly one of the most 
fascinating mathematicians 
of this century. His work is 
only now beginning to be 
fully discovered and 
appreciated. 

Ramanujan was born 100 
years ago in a small town in 
southern India. He was 
largely self-educated in 
mathematics. Before he 



turned 25, he had discov- 
ered hundreds of com- 
plicated formulas on his 
own. During 1913-1919, he 
worked with G. H. Hardy, a 
famous English mathema- 
tician. In 1919, Ramanujan 
fell seriously ill and died at 
the age of 32. 

Ramanujan used to work 
his formulas out on a slate, 
erasing them with his elbow 
as he went on. He recorded 
the final forms in his note- 
book. Mathematicians have 
spent many valuable and 
productive years providing 
theorems that Ramanujan 
knew to be true. Many new 
subdisciplines within 
mathematics have emerged 
out of Ramanujan's ideas. 



In 1976, 130 pages of his old 
handwritten notes were 

found which contain his 
work during the last year of 
his life. This is the Lost 
Notebook of Ramanujan. It 
will lake mathematicians 
several years of research to 
unravel many of the results 
in the notebook. 

The talk on Oct. 19 is be- 
ing organized by the 
Purdue-Indiana Math Club. 
All interested persons are 
invited to attend. For more

cal sciences offices jn

Like the NEA, said 
Futrell. (he CED report 
recognizes that tougher 
standards and higher ex- 
pectations are important in 
education. But to raise 
standards without increas-

■■The report also affirms 
NEA's long-held belief that 
it's critical lo intervene 
early in order to pul at-risk 
youngsters on the right path 
to educational success." 
Futrell added, pointing to 
existing programs in vari- 
ous parts of the country 
ihal exemplify tlie success 
of the early intervention 
approach. 

"The CED report reaf- 
firms the important point 
thai education for all chil- 
dren is not an expense, but 



play an important commu-

Futrell continued. "The re-

achievement of our national 
economic and social goals 
directly correlales lo our 
ability to educate all youth 
— including the more Ihan 
one-third of our school-age

The NEA, Futrell said, 
fully agrees with CED that 
"failure lo educate all youth 
is Iruly the greater cost lo 
society" and that "any plan 
for major improvements in

Problems faced by county 
and lownship officials were 
the order of (he day 
Thursday during a meeting 
Ijetween State Representa- 
tive Richard Worden (R- 
New Haven) and Allen 
County officials. 

The veteran Republican 
legislator, chairman of Ihe 
House County and Township 
Commidee, me( wilh the 
officials in an attempt lo 
define their various prob- 
lems, and trying to devise 
possible legislative solutions 
where new laws can help. 

During the meeting. 

Worden met wilh officials 
representing township trus- 
tees, township assessors, 
the Allen County Council 
and the county surveyor. 
Topics ranged from ad- 
justments to Indiana's laws 
concerning poor relief funds 
to changing properly taxes 
lo excise taxes tor boats 
and trailers. 

■I (eel the meeting gave 
the ^ ofHcehoIders in Allen 

County a chance to meet 
with me well ahead of the 
1988 session of the legisla- 
ture, " said Worden. "By 
meeting this far in advance, 



we'll be able to look at a 
variety of possible answers 
to the problems brought up 
at the meeting, lo see which 
solutions might be most 
effective " 

Worden said meetings 
with county and township 
officials have proved to be 
valuable in past sessions, 
and is hopeful (his week's 
meeting and other gath' 
erings will prove equally 
useful in the 19SB session 
scheduled to start in 
January. 

Worden plans lo meet 
wilh other county and 
(ownshlp officials from his 
district which includes por- 
tions of Allen. Whitley and 
Noble Counties as well as 
all of Adams County. Those 
representatives will include 
judges, members of law 
enforcement agencies, 
probalion departments and

Oil oversupply pressures gas prices 



A world oversupply ol 
crude oil will lead lo a 
softness in prices, but con- 
sumers probably won't see 
much of an improvement in 
gasoline prices at the 
pumps, an Indiana Uiuver- 
sity expert says. 

James M. Patterson, lU 
professor of marketing, said 
the world oil supply is cur- 
rently about 10 percent 
greater than is needed to 
make the system run 
smoothly. 

"OPEC is producing at 
atiout 3 million barrets a 
day more than the targeted 
rale, and inventories are 
about 6 percent above what 
Ihey were this time last 
yckr." he said. "With in- 
(eres( rates changing, mak- 
ing holding inventories 
more expensive, there is a 
considerable surplus and 
that's going lo pul pressure 
onjirices." 

Further pressure comes 
from flat demand for oil. 
which is estimated lo grow 
by only '- percent from 1986 
to 19B7 OPEC IS not a very 
effective cartel when de- 
mand is slack. Pallerson 
said, because the incentive 
is strong for members of 
the cartel Co cheat and 
produce more than their 
^uola. 

The excess production 
will have an even greater 
impact on oil prices now 
Piat Saudi Arabia has an- 
nounced it will no longer 



absorb the difference be- 
tween OPEC quotas and 
actual production. 

The pressure on oil prices 
will keep gasoline prices 
from rising further, but 
Patterson doubts whether 
consumers will see much 
decline in prices at the 
pumps. 

"My concern is that the 
structure of the industry 
has changed fairly sub- 
stantially since the early 
'70s. In Ihe past, with this 
kind of surplus, you'd see 
major price concessions. 

"What's happened in the 
last 15 years, though, is that 
the independent marketers 
have largely l&gt;een brought 
up by the integrated sup- 
pliers, or else they have 
come to see the wisdom of 
not breaking with the sys- 
tem. And as a result, the 
tendency for surpluses to 
result in price cuts has been 
greatly sutxlued." 

Both oil and gasoline 
prices rose in July and 
August, largely t&gt;ecause of 
speculation about (he situa- 
tion in the Persian Gulf, the 
IV professor said. The un- 
certainly of that situation 
remains the major hitch to 
projecting the behavior of 
oil markets in the near 
future. 

Although the United 
Stales receives most of its 
oil from Western sources 
ralher than from the GuU. 
Patterson explained, a dis- 



turbance in that area would 
still affect U.S. consumers 
because of the degree of in- 
terdependence of the world 
market. 

"All sources of crude are 
linked together through a 
very viable international . 
crude market. If there was 
a disruption of Gulf oil to 
Japan and Western Europe, 
then Japan and Western 
Europe would immediately 
begin bidding for Mexican, 
Canadian and Latin Amer- 
ican oil. and drive its price 
up. 

"So they're all substitutes 
(or each other, and in this 
kind of market Ihe actual 
source isn't nearly so im- 
portant as the level o( 
supply and demand on a 
worldwide basis." 

Overall, the United Slates 
imports about the same 
percentage of iU petroleum

IU promotes international awareness 



few weeks' lim 
delegates representing Ihe 
IS member-countries of 
Ihe Uniled Nations, in- 
cluding a delegation from 
Indiana University, will 
gather at Butler Univer- 
sity in Indianapolis lo 
discuss matters of foreign 
policy 

Indiana University? 

Well, the "U.N." meet- 
ing — scheduled 
Thursday, Ocl 22. lo Sat- 
urday, Ocl. 24, isn'l ex- 
actly the real thing. It is 
one of a series of model 
United Nations confer- 
ences held at different 
universities around the 
country, designed to help 
participants practice dip- 
lomatic skills and increase 
Iheir knowledge of differ- 
ent geopolitical regions. 

The delegates from IU 
are memtjers of the In- 
ternational Relations Or- 
ganization, a 40-meml&gt;er 
student group that seeks 



lo promote awareness of 



nteri 



af(air 



among its memliers and 
on (he IU campus in 

general. 

"Our main emphasis b 
on politics, and the politics 
of international relations," 
said Andreas 

Hadjikyriacos, a political 
science major from 
Cyprus who is IRO 
president. 

But, he said. "You don't 
have to have a strong 
background in politics or 
be a polilicat science ma- 
jor to participate. Politics 
includes economic, busi' 
ness. geographical, cul- 
lural and military consid- 
erations." so thai anyone 
who is interested in any 
aspect of international re- 
lations can lake part. 

In addition to partici- 
pating in the mock U.N. 
conferences, IRO mem- 
bers hold discussions on 
various inlemalional is- 



sues and sponsor films, 
lectures by guest speak- 
ers, and coffee hours held 
in conjunction with inler- 
nalional student 

associations. 

This year the group, 
which was founded in 1982. 
will try a new idea. Each 
member will be asked to 
choose a particular 
country, preferably re- 
lated to their coursework, 
interests or foreign lan- 
guage skills, then keep the 
other members informed 
of current events in or 
concerning Ihat country 
throughout the semester. 

Trish Ryan, publicity 
chairman for Ihe IRO, 
thinks the organization 
can "open inlemalional 
linBc "(iw.Trd studenL*: who 
have never been exposed 
lo them before " 

"They should know what 
is going on oulside," she 
said. "The world's getting 
smaller. There's loo much 



out there to have thai 
single poinl of view." 

One new memt&gt;er of the 
IRO is Singaporean Leong 
Yew, who joined to (ind 
out more alwul different 
countries and to meet new 

"It's a discussion group, 
so il promotes a greater 
flexibihty of thought and

opinions," he said. 

The International Rela- 
tions Organization 
sponsored by political 
science professor Alfred 
DiamanI, an expert in 
West European politics. 
The group is in the proc-

tries today as it did in 1973, 
when slightly more than 6 
million barrels per day 
were being imported, or 
34.8 percent of the nation's

That figure reached a 
high of 43 percent in 1978. 
but declined in the early

By 1986, the United Slates

Although the American oil 
industry has revived

"After the matches a 
number of people said we 
were one of the best small 
college teams they had seen 
in the islands." said Ball. 
"A number of good things 
came out of the trip for the 
kids. The lour was well or- 
ganiied; the weather was 
great; and they got a 
chance to see some culture. 
Some of them had never 
flown before and never been 
to California The team also 
went to a luau, saw Pearl 
Harbor, and visited a live 
volcano. The educational 
experience was in- 
valuabte." said Ball, 

"The trip was more than 
we expected; we didn't 
know if we could compete," 
said Ball "We are not 
really known to other 
programs."

Oct 11. in the match 
against Milwaukee. The 
Admirals and the Komets 
played this game at the 
McMillcn Ice Arena due lo 
problems with the ice at the 
Coliseum, 

Despite the change in 
surroundings, which may 
have been a plus for Fort 
Wayne, the KomeLs played 
a strong game. Dufour was 
in goal for the K's. and al- 
lowed only one goal in Ihe 
first period. Scoring in the 
first period for the Komets 
was Bob Curtis, formerly 
with Kalamazoo. 

The second period con- 
tinued with the K's bom- 



barding the Admiral de- 
fense as three more Komet 
goals were added: at 1.00, 
Matechuk tallied; Dumas 
followed at 7;S9; and t?urtis 
scored again al 16:41 on a 
powerplay. 

The Komets wrapped up 
the match in Ihe third pe- 
riod with two more goals, 
from Chin at 8:48 and Hollett 
at 9:22. t&gt;oth on the pow- 
erplay. The final score in 
this match was 6-1, with 33 
shots on goal from the K's 
and 22 from Milwaukee. 

On Saturday, Oct. 10. the 
Komets did something new 
this year, holding an inter- 
squad game at the Coll- 



seimi. Open to the public, 
the evening began with 
General Manager Bob

Coliseum, The first period 
opened Ihe game with 
several skirmishes resulting 
in over 40 penalty minutes 
total. Scoring was limited lo 
one goal each, with Gary 
Bernard tallying for the 
Komets 

In the second period, 
things lightened up. Kal- 
amazoo was first lo score, 
at 4:55, and Ihe Komets fol- 
lowed wilh a goal at 15:S5 
from Hollett on a pow- 
erplay. Laird took advan- 
tage of the game situation 
and played both goalies, 
switching from Raymond to 
Ric Poirier at 13:13 of the 
second period. 

The third period, how- 
ever, was totally dominated 
by the Wings as they scored 
three more goals and goalie 
Mike Sands shut-out the 
Komet offense. The final 
score was 5-2, wilh Ihe 
Komets marking up 23 shots 
on goal to Kalamazoo's 27, 

The Komets rebounded 
from this loss on Sunday, 



All sports agents doing 
business in Indiana will 
have (o be licensed if legis- 
lation proJKised by Stale 
Representative Robert 
Alderman (R-Fort Wayne) 
is adopted by the 1988 Gen- 
eral Assembly. 

Alderman discussed the 
preliminary bill al a press 
conference at the State- 
house Oct, 7. 

The legislation will pre- 
vent sports agents from 
paying collegiate athletes 
tor representation rights 
while Ihey are still eligible 
to play college ball, accord- 
ing to Alderman. This 



would help to avoid situa- 
tions like those of Rod 
Woodson of Purdue, and 
Chris Carter of Ohio Stale. 
Both athletes were re- 
cruited illegally by profes- 
sional sporls agents while 
still in school. Woodson had 
already graduated, but the 
NCAA ruled that Carier 
was ineligible lo play col- 
lege ball this year. 

"When you're a college 
student and not making any 
money, and a sports agent 
offers you thousands of dol- 
lars to let him represent 
you, it's tough lo turn 



down," said the Fort Wayne 
lawmaker, "But college 
athletic careers have ticcn 
ruined, and students have 
left school early to turn pro 
t}c cause of these recruiting 
practices. The athlete loses 
in the long run." 

The proposed bill would 
establish guidelines lor and 
require hcensing of sporls 
agents. The legislation 
would provide tor revoca- 
tion of licenses if the guide- 
lines are nol followed.

Looking back into the 
expanding history of rock-n- 
roU, few would contend that 
Aerosmilh was one of the 
super groups of the seven- 
ties. With the dual guitars 
of Joe Perry and Brad 
Whitford, and the banshee 
howl of vocalist Steven 
Tyler, Aerosmilh pounded 
their way into the pre- 
Heavy Metal hard rock ar- 
chives of the early-mid 
seventies 

With the sy nth-pop wave 
of the early eighties, the 
group's popularity waned, 
and a period of separation 



ensued. Now, as is so fash- 
ionable lately, they're to- 
gether again, and have 
churned out a new album. 

"Permanent Vacation" 
goes back to the blues, the 
band's roots, except that it 
bastardizes the sound, mix- 
ing in trashy power chords 
with failed experiments of 
various music forms; i.e., 
the appearance of cellos, 
horns, and even the sounds 
of killer whales dubbed over 
the tracks. Truly, instead of 
being an innovative rock 
album from the veterans of 
down-n-dirly rock, al! the 
trappings of standard gar- 
bage metal are here: 
screaming guitars, pound- 
ing bass lines, wailing 
vocab, and the same rebel 
outlaw/women-are-meat

REVIEW 



The single of the album, 
"Dude tLooks Like a 
Lady)" is one of the most 
mindless, inane pieces of 
worthlessness to hit the 
airwaves in a long time, as 
ar« many of the twelve 
songs on the record 

This is a record with no 
direction, a money-making 
venture created with the 
hope of keeping an aging 
relic alive. An act of sac- 
rilege is even committed 
here: a cover of the Beat-

probably makes John 
Lennon's spirit shudder in 
disgust. 

When Aerosmith collatx&gt;- 
rated with Run DMC on a 
re-make of their top ten hit 
'Walk this Way," I lost any 
respect for the band. Now 
with "Permanent Vaca- 
tion." lack of respect has 
turned to resentment and 
disgust. One would hope 
that after this, Aerosmith 
does lake a permanent 
vacation.

On Tuesday. Oct. 20. 
Salem 66 will be playing a 
live concert at Karma Rec- 
ords, located five minutes 



Salem 66 is an alternative 
guitar oriented band from 
Boston that are achieving 
success, especially in the 
college radio charts. Their 
music is combination of 
various influences, in- 
cluding an R,E,M.-like 
sound. 

To quote Rolling Stone, 
"Salem 66 is a rare moment 
of introspection amid the 
fury, its edgy guitars 
and melodic foreboding 
contrasting with Judy 
Grunwald's and Beth 
Kaplan's angelic altos. If 
you're looking tor the sound 
of underground America in 
revolt, here 'tis, in all its 
frenzied glory." 

The band has three al- 



bums out, the newest ju; 
released on CD, for whic 
they are currently lourinj 
released on Komestea' 
Records and tapes. Saler 
66 consists of two girls an 
two guys, the girls tjeing th 
founders of the t&gt;and. An . 
what's best of all is th 
price; only two dollars b 
the door. 

It is very important tht 
as many people show up a 
can be. This could be th 
start of a precedent in thi 
city; al long last an altei 
native music scene is gel 
ting a chance to bud an 
blossom here. Let's sho^ 
some support, it promise 
to t&gt;e a night of great ei 
tertainment. Doors open a 
nine. Be there! 



'Hellraiser' 

A confusing, frustrating mess with no plot 



It was dumb. It was sipw 
and it was dumb. All 
"Hellraiser" raised in me 
was the urge to leave before 
the predictable ending. 



REVIEW 



After plodding through 
some horrifyingly realistic 
and unexplained gore, the 
film jimips through an un- 
defined void of time to the 
present day 

Enter the family: father 
I Andrew Higgens), daugh- 



ter lAshley Laurence), 
and.. Dad's wife (Claire 
Robinson). This should 
present an interesting con- 
flict. The key word in this 
phrase is "should." We 
should have seen either all 
of the conflict or none of it. 
The amount we saw was 
frustrating at best. 

But, alas, after some 
painfully slow theatrics, the 
thrust of the film comes to 
light. Now, follow this 
closely; the blood from a 
flesh wound brings back the 
happy -head-of -household's- 
lormented-past-lhe-poinl-of- 
death brother, Frank, from 
within the floor of the attic. 
For some unexplained rea- 
son, the wife feels compel-

led to help reincarnate the 
now semi-existent (just 
musclesi Frank by brutally 
kilUng people with a ham- 
mer. We can only assume 
it's because she wants to 
have sex with him, her 
husband's undead brother, 
because she remembers 
how nice it was befored.e. 
sometime long before the 
void at the beginning of the 
film). 

Finally, about halfway 
through the film, we finally 
learn what the hellraiser is. 
All 1 will tell you is that it's 
not the man in the ad- 
vertisement with the face of 
nails. (The nail-faced dude 
is a Celobite, a bringer of 
"pleasure and pain, in- 
separable." Frank needs to 



hurry up and become re&lt; 
onstituled so he can fie 
these Celobites...). 

If all this sounds confic 
ing, it is— not to mentio 
far-fetched— and the filr 
gives us no incentive to tr 
and sort it out. Nor does i 
give us the necessary di 
tails. The lime wasted i 
bad pacing should hav 
been spent explaining th 
underlying premise. 

All in all, the film ha 
decent make-up and gor 
effects and a beautifi 
Ashley Laurence, but th 
lousy photography mor 
than cancelled the fei 
plusses out.
