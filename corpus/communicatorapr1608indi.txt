IPFW Sociology Student Association to 
Host DVD and Penpal Drive for Troops 




By KATY ANDERSON 



Recently, about 600 
soldiers from the Fort 
Wayne, who are now 
based Isi Battalion 293rd 
Infantry, were deployed 
to Kuwait, They will even- 
tually depan for Iraq. 

In the mean time, the 
soldiers will be having 
some free time in Ku- 
wait, and will be in need 
of some entertainment 
and stress relief. 

To alleviate some of 
the stresses associated 
with the duties of the sol- 
diers, the IPFW Sociology 
Student Association will 
be hosting a DVD and 
Penpal Drive for a Sup- 
port OurlVoops Project. 

The Sociology Stu- 
dent Association will 
be collecting the DVDs 
and ViHll have supplies 
and penpal information 



available at their table on 
Ihe Ground Floor ofWalb 
on Wed. Apr. 23 from 10 
a.m. until 2 p.m. 

People can bring 
DVDs to donate, all of 
which can be either new 
or used. However, the 
DVDs are required to be 
legal, meaning that they 
have not been burned. 

According to IPFW 
student and Sociol- 
ogy Student Association 
member JanelleNannini, 
the need lo show support 
for the troops was recog- 
nized and the group de- 
cided to do something to 
show their appreciation. 

"Personally, 1 do have 
several friends in the 
military and saw the ef- 
fects of this latest 
ment on the soldiers 
and their families, 
Nannini said. 



"Many of the currently 
deployed soldiers are 
IPFW students or alum- 
ni, with more soldiers 
currently attending here. 
So this deployment has a 
very direct impact on the 
[PFW community." 

Besides this upcom- 
ing drive, the Sociology 
Student Associadon re- 
cendy showed "Baghdad 
EB". which demonstrates 
the reality and harshness 
of the current war. The 
organization showed this 
in order to raise aware- 
ness of the situation and 
to affirm that their sup- 
port will not end with 
these events. The c 
nlzadon plans 



to continue these sup- 
port projects throughout 
next year. 

The Sociology Student 
Association will be taking 
a very neutral stance on 
the war itself. 

"We feel it is vital to 
drive home to the IPFW 
student body as well as 
the Fort Wayne commu 
nity that it doesn't mat 
ter how you feel abou 
the war," Nannini said. 
"We need to support out 
troops!"

Beer and biofuel 

Oil polluteSr but burning food for fuel is worse 



An Op/Ed 
By DOUGUS SCHMIDT 



Although the search 
for alternative fuels 
began with the best of 
intentions, ethanol may 
do more harm than good. 
The increasing demand 
for ethanol is creating a 
host of problems. 

Analy s t s are p roj ectin g 
that the production of 
corn-based ethanol 

will double within a 
decade. As a result, 
/\mericans may see 
pricier beer, higher food 
prices and, eventually, 
environmental 



devastation. 

In the near future, 
a night out at the bar 
could be dramatically 
mo re expensive. Massive 
ethanol subsidies are 
leading many farmers 
to abandon other, 
less profitable crops 
and switch to corn. 
As a result, the supply 
of barley has shrunk 
considerably. Breweries 
are paying more than 
double for the crop, a 
key ingredient of beer, 
and passing that cost 
along to consumers. 

Poor hops harvests 
and higher shipping 
costs also share the 
blame for the price 



hike. In some areas, the 
price of six packs has risen 
by SI. 50 or more. Small 
brewers have been hit the 
hardest, with the price 
of crafl beers increasing 
by 12 percent in the past 
year. 

Diverting the supply of 
corn away from food will 
likely lead lo higher prices 
at the grocery store. 

According to an article 
in The Economist, food 
had been getting cheaper 
for over thirty years, but 
that trend came lo an 
abrupt end in 2005. Since 
then, world food prices 
have jumped to their

By EDWARD NELSON

The Olympics is an 
international gathering 
that promotes friendly 
relations by means 
of genial athletic 
competition. However, 
the controversy that 
currently engulfs China 
may cast the -,

in weapons in 2005, 
making it Sudan's largest 
arms supplier and the 
biggest contributor

their inaction angered 
demonstrators, but it is 
believed that if China 
simply slopped trading 
with Sudan it would alter

The promise of a few 
athletes to be absent 
from the games has 
added to the Olympic 
controversy as well. 
Today, Beijing stands as 
one of the world's most 
polluted cities. 

For this reason, the

Instead, China 

continues to disapprove 

of U.N. action, with the 

claims that it is trying to 

silendy negotiate with 

Sudan. Recent 

events in Tibet have 

also hurt China's image. 

MSNBC reported 

that, in mid-March, 

demonstrations for 

Tibet's independence 

started out peaceful but 

led to the death of at least 

16 people. 

Although the Chinese 

have stringent security 

measures in place, 

Tibetans still crowd the

traditional running of 
the Olympic flame has 
met unusuaily harsh 
responses. Last week, 35 
British protestors were 
arrested orithe streets of 
London when a protest 
grew out of control and an 
attempt to extinguish the 
flame almost succeeded. 

The cause of protest 
is credited to the fact thai 
the Olympics are being 
held in Beijing. Currently, 
many in the international 
community are upset 
with_ the Chinese 
government because 
it has been supplying 
weapons to Sudan, a 
country endeavoring 
to complete the 21si 
century's first genocide 
in Darftir, and of violently 
suppressing Tibet. 

Adding to China's 
public relations problems 
are the athletes refusing 
to compete because of 
the country 'sdangerously

such as women's tennis 
champion lustine Henin, 
have also said that the 
smog and pollution in 
China has posed health 
threats that have forced 
them to withdraw from 
competing. 

Although several 

athletes have called for 
a separation of politics 
and sports this Olympic 
season, the protests 
during the running of 
the Olympic flame have 
established this request 
as fruitless. In some 
cases though, politics 
will not even be present 
at the games. Already

The lerm "lax defier" 
represents a dramatic

For decades, government 
officials have referred 
to those who question 
tax laws as "resistors" or 
"protestors." Court cases 
like Gilbert v. Miriami, 



The Department of 
Justice has created a 
new program designed 
to punish those who 
would "defy" U.S.

Attorney General for

"The term 'tax

United States v. Scott and

the term "tax protestor" 
The IRS's Web site refers

that Hochman "feels

However, "defiers" is 
far from neutral. 

The words "protest," 
"resist" and "defy" have 
similar definitions, but 
the connotations are 
^ quite different. This 
can be seen in these 
example sentences 
from the Cambridge 
dictionary (http:// 
dictionary. 
Cambridge, org): 
-^^ "A big crowd of 

protesting against cuts in 
health spending." 

"Students want

highest levels in over 150 
years, even adjusting for 
inflation. 

hi 2007, the world 
price of corn hit an all- 
time record. Data from 
Uie United Nation's 
Food and Agriculture 
Organization shows that 
world grain prices have 
increased by 80 percent 
in the last year alone. 

A big cause of the 
increasing food prices is 
burning crops for fuel. 
Americans burned a third 
of last year's corn harvest 
as biofucl. A single SUV 
tank's worth of ethanol Is 
made with enough corn 
to feed a petson for a 
year. 

The increasing 

price of food is having 
the greatest impact on 
disadvantaged countries, 
where starving workers 
are resorting to violence. 
Recent weeks have seen 
riots in Haiti, where food 
prices have risen by more 



than 50 percent in the 
last year, and in Egv^pt. 
where protestors burned 
buildings and attacked 
police. 

Some scientists are 
now saying that biofuel 
alsohasanegativeimpact 
on the environment. 
Throughout the world, 
massive amounts of 
land are being cleared to 
grow crops for biofuel. 
Huge swadis of Amazon 
rainforest have already 
been destroyed. A rccem 
study by the journal 
Science stated ihat 
clearing land to grow 
biofuel releases 17 to 
420 times more carbon 
dioxide than the fossil 
fiiel it replaces. 

Energy independence 
and helping the 
environment are obvious 
goods, but the high cost 
of biofuel may be too 
much to pay.

Top 10 Things I Don't 

Understand About Women | 

10. Ever see a women in a leather coat say she's a vegetarian? 
Apparently, cows hale being eaten but love not having skin. 

9. Women say they love long walks on the beach, but they 
always give up after five or six miles. Looks like somebody 
shouldii'i have worn heels! 

8. Women love candlelit dinners and snuggling in front of 

the fire, but eventually, they start to wonder if you have 

electricity. 

7. Why are women so greedy? I asked my last girlfriend 

if she loved me for my money, and she said "Sure, it 

seemed like a good trade." 

6. Why are women always sending you to get things? 

Every day. it's "Get my purse. Get some ice cream. Get a 

job." 

S.Women love compliments, but apparently I'm only 
allowed to comphment certain diings. "You have beau- 
tiful eyes" is okay, but not "you have sexy elbow flaps." 

4. Also, Iliey hate it when you refer to yourself as "Daddy." 
Or "Big Poppa." Or "Captain Magic Trousers." 

3. Women are always on diets, so why do they bother 
ordering when we go out to eat? Can't they just sit diere 
and look pretty while daddy has a steak? 

2. A woman will say she wants a baby, but she'll get all 
upset when you bring her one. 

1. Why do women ask such annoying questions? "What are 
you thinking?" "Does this dress make me look fat?" "Who are 
you and why are you in my hamper?"

It Scene 

5 VCD Senior Exhibit at the Allen County Public Library 




The Senior An Show 
has filled ihe gallery of the 
Allen County Public Li- 
brary. The show is exhib- 
iting work fram IPl^'s 
phoiogniphy and graphic 
design seniors. There 
were many inieresling 
exhibits displaying comic 
books, educational post- 
ers, book covers, bakery 
menus, and skate boanjs. 

The various worLs 
showed the students tal- 
ents, not only in graphic 
design, but also in creat- 
ing their own businesses 
and the products, such as 
menus, business cards, 
and product lists. One of 
the most artistic presen- 
tations was from Nicholas 
Pyle, who created com- 
positions in Adobe Pho- 
toshop. The pictures had 
names like _DSC0623.jpg 
and _DSC0086.jpg and 
were compositions of 
women who appeared to 
be floating in the air. The 
women appeared ethe- 
real and beaudhil amidst 
black and white outdoor 
backgrounds. 

Staria Williams dis- 
played the menus, invi- 
tations, price sheets, and 
ads - a&amp; well as what ap- 
peared to be a cake Itself 
- for the cake business 
she would like to open 
someday. Everything in 
her display was very pret- 
ty, colorful, and sparkly. It 
was very appealing to the 
eye and the statue looked 
good enough to eat. 

Horia MaJutan dis- 
played work for a spa and 
salon. The work, which 
included price sheets and 
business cards accented 
with pictures of beautiful 
women, had an element 
of beauty lo it that 1 find 
hard to describe. While 
some have referred to the 
work as classical. I found 
it more exotic and edgy. 

Another exhibit in- 
cluded comic book pag- 
es by Sally Scott for the 
"Darkness Aftermath" 
series. The work was re- 
ally different and it made 
me think about just how 
much work goes into cre- 
ating a comic book. The 
exhibit looked so interest- 
ing that I wanted to read 
the series. 

Another interesting 
exhibit included the work 
by Kelly Jones . She creat- 
ed what looked like shad- 
ow boxes with Uie photos 
separated into nine piec- 
es. It was such a different 
way of looking at pictures 
that makes a person con- 
sider each individual pan 
of a picture. Overall, the 
gallery is worth eiqiloring 
and considering.

Save a Life Day at IPFW 



By AARON DONOVAN 

DDnoapOieiprw.edu 



Save a Life Day is in 
recognition of April be- 
ing National Donate Life 
Month and in- 
tends to accom- 
plish two goals. 

The first goal is 
to bring a\vareness 
to the students of 
IPFW of the need 
for organ and tis- 
sue donation. The 
second goal of 
this event is to en- 
courage sbjdenis 
to sign their oi^an 
and tissue donor 
cards in addition to in- 
forming their loved ones 
of their wishes. 

The events planned 
for this day will take 
place 'I\jes., Apr, 22 from 
10 a.m. until 4 p.m. in the 
hallway of the Walb ball- 



I on the first floor. 
Six organizations will 
be present at this event, 
consisting ofThe Nation- 
al Kidney Foundation of 
Indiana, The Indiana Or- 
gan Procurement Orga- 
, Donor Services 




of Indiana, Indiana Lion's 
Eye Bank, Parkview Hos- 
pital, and Lutheran Hos- 
pital. 

Each organization 
will be given a table for 
their use, and they are 
encouraged to bring any 



signage that advertises 
their organization. 

At the same time of 
this event, above the 
ballroom, the Red Cross 
will be carrying out their 
annual campus blood 
drive. 

Additionally, 
the other orga- 
nizations will be 
bringing informa- 
tional brochures 
concerning organ 
donation, donor 
cards, pens, pen- 
cils, bracelets, and 
miscellaneous 
items to hand out 
to the students. 
Those participat- 
ing in this event 
hope to make a powerM 
statement to the students 
and community, through 
the sheer number of or- 
ganizations at the event, 
as well as highlight the 
importance of organ and 
tissue donation.

Knee injuries cut indoor career short for Zbyszewsl&lt;i 

■ Former IPFW Ail-American back in Toronto rehabbing, preparing for summer on the sand as part of Canadian National Team 



By DAN VANCE 

Aan-va ncr«1rancM» publiutiDrK-nei 

The last time IPFW had a first team Ail-American, 
his name was hardly pronounceable. Still, Matt 
Zbyszewski (pronounced zyb • shef ■ ski), left an 
indelible signature on the men's volleyball's storied 
history at the school. 

And now, his indoor volleyball career has come 
to an end after three years playing on the European 
circuit. After time in Greece, Cyprus and Spain (one 
ofthe canary islands), Zbyszewski has returned to his 
native Toronto, Ontario, Canada to rehab a longtime 
knee injury. 



"I came back before the end of the season due 
to some nagging injuries that wouldnt go away, 
Zbyszewski said. "Since then. I found out the my 
professional indoor playing days are over because 
multiple operations during my days at IPRV where 
my knee suffered irreversible damage. " 

Just two and a half weeks ago, he had his Hflh 
knee surgery where it was discovered that his lateral 
meniscus (theshockabsorber inside the knee) is gone 
and chunk of the cartilage on the head of the femur is 
also gone, exposing the bone. 

"On top of this my ACL, which was reconstructed 
twice, is incompetent and provides almost no 
stability." Zbyszewski added. 



But that is not the end for Zbyszewski, who will be 
rehabbing his knee over the next couple of months to 
prepare for beach season in the summer, where he is 
part of Canada's Senior National Team. Zbyszewski 
hopes to get into a few FiVB tournaments with his 
team this summer in the Czech Republic, Latvia, 
Sivitzerland and Poland. 

When the season ends, he will consider another 
ACL surgerj- and hopes that his body will hold up 
enough to work towards qualifying for the 2012 
Summer Olympics in London. England. 

Zbyszewski cherishes his times playing overseas, 
including Greece, where he played alongside former 
Fvlaslodons Jeff Ptak. Jorge Ralal and Panos Eracleus.

#1 Ohio State 

I The Buckeyes earned the 
top spot by one game, but 
he week off has not done 
teams well lately. 2003 was 
the last time #1 won it all, 

#2Ball5tatevs#7Quincy 

■ Ball State has been 
dominating while Qunicy 
managed just one MIVA 
win. This should be win 
#20 for the Cardinals. 

#3 Lewis vs #6 Mercyhurst 

■ Lewis is finally eligible for 
postseason play after bans. 
They have the only 20-win 
season for a MIVA team. 
Here is to number 21. 

#4 Loyola vs #5 IPFW 

■ The Mastodons have beat 
Loyola three straight years 
in the tournament. The 
'Dons are playing strong 
and should edge out a win. 



Patrick Durbin - BSU 

■ The Cardinal senior leads the 
MIVA with 4.28 kills/game. 
He has 402 overall and may 
be the MIVA POTY. 

Ian Anderson - Loyola ' 

■ Anderson Is following Durbin ; 
with 4.14 kills/game. He i 
leads the conference in total ; 
kills with 418. 

Robbie Klein - OSU 

■ A strong hitter and blocker, 
Klein leads the conference in 
points/game with 4.64. He is 
just a a junior. 

Brocic Ullrich - IPFW 

■ Now third all-time in service 
aces, Ullrich's service power 
has become a mainstay of 
postseason runs.

last hvo All-Tournament leams 
and was the loumament MVP in 
2006. 

/Vnolher thing that IPFW has 
used ro their advantage in past 
postseasons in depth on their 
bench. Ball thinks that element is 
coming around too, 

"We feel good aboul the kids 
coming in off the bench," he said. 

Freshman Daryl Shank 
played libero in game three of 
last Saturday's loss to Penn State 
and played well. Ball also noted 
the strong help from junior Mike 
Morjci as service specialist and 
senior Steve Rogers as a middle 
blocker off the bench. 

The team has also been 
shooting for the record books in 
recent weeks. Stewart was the 
first to accomplish one, setting a 
new career block assist record for 
IPFW against Penn State. His 512 
surpasses the previous mark of 



509 held by Serdar Sikca. 

Macias is now fifth in digs at 
716 and he and Ullrich have taken 
over second and third in service 
aces at 151 and 144 repectivly. 
The big watch however is in career 
kills, where Macias is now second 
at 2,053 for his career. Hector Soto 
holds the record and Macis would 
need to average 28 kills over tlie 
last possible five matches to break 
the record. 

Records aside, it is the goal of 
this team lo be the first since Ball 
State to vnn three straight MIVA 
Tournament titles. The Cardinals 
accomplished it in 1988-1990. 
Ohio State is the only other team 
to win three in a row, not counting 
the Cardinal team that won the 
first five MfVA Tournaments, 
starting in 1954. IPIW did not play 
in the tournament until 19B4. 

And it is not out of a reach. Lewis 
won the conference tournament 




POWER: Senior Jason Yhost is 
a two-time MIVA Player of the 
Week leading the Mastodons. 

as a 5-seed in the MIVA in 2004. 
IPFW won it as a 4-seed in 2006, 

"We are looking forward to it." 
Ball said. "The kids are in a good 
frame of mind." 

So the impossible Irifecta may 
just be possible after all.
