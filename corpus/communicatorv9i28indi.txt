« quite busy since he stepped down from the 
rtmental chairmanship during the summer of 1976. He spent his sabbatical 
leave during the fall semester of 1976, as well as part of the summer of 1977, 
conducting seismological research at the Lincoln Laboratory of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. His research focused upon the upper mantle heterogen- 
iety and the core-mantle boundary in the Earth. He is also studying the seis- 
mic! ty of Chile with one of his students. 

Dipak's wife, Monju. is majoring in Accounting and is a senior in the Busi- 
ness Division. They have two sons — Sagar is in kindergarten and Sudip is in 
the 2nd grade. The Chowdhury family visited India for a month during the 
summer of 1976.

GET THE FACTS 



W- 



Do you make a decision without getting all of the facts. 
If you are like most people, you probably do not make a decision 
until you have all of the facts laid out before you. Only thenars 
you able to make a competent judgement. However at the 
same time most people avoid meeting with an insurance agent 
avoiding the facts. This itself is a big decision. 
Do you have all of the facts?
