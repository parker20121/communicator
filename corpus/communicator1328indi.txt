evidence as well Issues, such as 
the size and power of SG, are 
being debated. 

A dialogue has opened upas to 
how much the students' activity 
fee should be. what kind of 
activities, if any at all, the 
students want, and how 
Studenls' Government can 
make itself more efficient and 
receptive to these it is supposed 
to represent. 

Those already in power are 
losing their complacency as 
they are faced with a challenge 
by opponents who hope lo make

The most cynical among us 
may sell all this as jusi another 
farce, the most paranoid as a

with a real choice as to who will

Representing Clergy United for

minister ol Wcillicld Presbyterian 
Church, look pari in a panel discussion 
entitled ' 'Con-Mural Majority", held on 
March W in Keltler Hall. The Iwo men 
spoke lor over Iwo hours to a group of 20 

According lo Koppitch. "People are 
really afraid ol all kinds ol things. The 
Lefl. Right, and Middle all agree lhat 
Ihe United Slates and the world have 
drastically changed." 

To deal with the resulting anxiety

"The extreme religious right is nikTing

Koppitch said 

Yearning for sumeining in the past is 
nol necessarily helpful. Koppilch said. 
In response to the Moral Majority's 
claim thai the sound moral foundations 
ol Ihe Bible have disappeared from 
America. Koppilch replied thai such 
values may not be appropriate lor the 
present "An analogy of ihe United 



reading the ,.,uil' liitik- We're tillering 
the words Ihrough selective in- 
terpretations." 

Bolh agreed thai taking scriptures 
out of context was "doing vicious

Citing a group called "Bread for the

lo deal with the problems ol the world. 
"In the long run. to be calm and

The 'Flood ol '82' left ils mark on 
IPFW Now Ihc administration is 
starling lo feel Ihc afler-etfecls as it 
laces Ihc drawn-oul process of trying lo 
procure federal lunds and repair the 
flood damage. 

According to John Carnaghi. vice- 
chancellor lor Financial Afliars, the 
Federal Emergency Management 
Agency i FEMA i has agreed to pay 75 
pcrcenl ol the damage caused by the 
flood But Carnaghi said thai although 
IPFW will get money, 11 may have 
difficulties m gelling all thai is needed. 

During an April 12 inlerview. Car- 
naghi explained that FEMA. and 
representatives from IPFW and 
Purdue Wesl Ulayetle. surveyed the 
fl*Hl ilamage in the Walt) Memorial 
i the Helmke Library during 



more than jusi thecosl to repair dining 
and kitchen equipment in the Fori, 
motors and fuses in Ihe mechanical 
rooms, carpeting, lockers, doors, pool 
and ping-pong tables and olher ilems. 
He said Ihey estimated the cnsl in 
repairing areas thai mighl breakdown 
in Ihe future These areas include Ihe 
Wesl Campus Drive parking lol closesi 
lolheSt Joseph River, Ihe floorliles in 
the Walb Memorial Union and Ihe 
Helmke Library", and Ihe loading dock 



levelling of the St. Joseph River, 
Carnaghi said. 

fPFW and West Lafayelte have 
estimated lhat 1280,000 is needed lo 
make these sewer corrections FEMA 
has no! made an estimate yei, bul iltold 
IPFW il can only provide 15 percent of

"We do nol want paid government 
employees teaching the Bible There is 
more involved in teaching than Jusi Ihe 
knowledge of ihc scnplures." Koppitch 
said "It is necessary lo have par-

Christian community, and lo know Ihe 
body of Christ." he sajd.

Together. FEMA 
Virginia estimated IPFW's flood 
damages would run approximately 
$215,000. a figure much less than thai of 
IPFW and Wesl Lafayette's 

Carnaghi said the difference between 
the two estimates resulted because* 
IPFW and Wesl Lafayelte figured in

Because damage lo these areas was 
not visible, FEMA did not include II in 
its estimate, bul [old IPFW il would slill

flood damage occurs by July 2 If il

IPFW will miss out on thai portion of 
tho funding. . - . 

"If It occurs after July J. It will be 
blamed on something that is not flood 
related. Idee the July humidity, and we 
won't gel the aid. " he said 

Besides asking for aid to repair the 
campus. Carnaghi said the ad- 
preventive measures can be taken, in 
case the campus U flooded again. 
Most of the damage was caused by

Carnaghi added thai a FEMA

IPFW's side in the issue and may prove 
lo be a lactor in the decision of whether 
or nol IPFW will have to purchase flood 
insurance. 

"He said he understands our side in 
the issue and thai he would support it." 
Carnaghi said "The Chicago office of 
FEMA will make Ihe final decision," 

After all the estimates are madeand

weapons suchas Ihc MIRV it is capable 
of putting a check on Soviet numbers
