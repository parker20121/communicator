City Council passes flood plan ordinance 



By SCOT W ESN ER 
Staff Writer 

Allhough the flood waters have 
receded, the flood problem has not 

gone away, only Into hibematlDa 

IPFW Continuing EducaUon, In 
cooperation with IFFW'i department 
of consiiuction technology held a 
seminar March 22 to give pecfile in 
flood-prone areas inTormation abojt 
Ihe Nabonal Flood Insurance Act and 
new Flood litsuranceRate Maps which 
became eflecUve April 3. 

The Fori Wayne City Council passed 
a controversial flood plain ordinance 
April 3 to keep from losing federal 
flood insurance and disaster aid. The 
Federal Emergency Management 
Agency said Ihe city had to pass the 
ordinance to remain In the program. 

FEMA wants lo reduce the number 
of stnjchires in the Rood pUln. This 
move has several neighbvhDOd 
leaders up in arms. Residents of 
Monarch Part, near Georgetown 
Square, and Wealmoor Park, near 
Times Comers Shopping Center, are 
worried what will happen to their 
homes under tbe new res trie bona. 






I would allow 
only B one time expansion of eilsllDg 
structures and new tHjiidlngs would 
have In be at least two leclhlgher than 
the wster level of the IB13 flood. II 
wculd also force residents in the ares 
lo begin paying lor flood Insurance. 
The City Council unveiled a process 

appeal their placement In the flood 
plain on ihe map. Indiana Department 
d Nahirai Resources RepresenlBllve 
William Trokimas explained tope&lt;¥le 
atlending the IPFW flood Seminar 
what farms and letters would need lo 
be filled out to make revisions or 
amendments to the state flood maps. 

Bruce Franke &lt;i IPFWs depart- 
ment of construction technology said 
the Oly Cnincil had to pass the Rood 
ordinance because "If we (Fort 
Wayne) didn't go into the federal 
program by Saturday (April 3) tl)ere 
" ' ■ ■ That 



more trouble than residenbal areas if 
ihe ordinance was col poised 

"If I were a buyer," he said, "and 
planned on doing anything with a 
building beyond buying It. I would look 
elsewhere, because there are a lol of 
places above the Rood plain

Now Ihat the city Is protected by the

Tests suggest possible freeze on student aid 



WASHINGTON D.C. (CPS)-In Ihe Rrst i 
student aid. a key Senate commillee has turr 
proposaLstocullederalsludentaid. 

The tests jugg est Congresa ultimately may freeze Ibe aid budget for a year. 

For the moment, coiiege lobbyists seem happy thai Ongress has indicated It 
won't accept the Reagan aid cuts. 

In mid-March, ihe Senate Budget Committee junked the president's plan to limit 
aid Id H.DOO per student per year, and cut off from old altogether sbidenta from 
families earning more ihan EQ.OOO a year. 

Bul committee Republicans did endorse a plan to cut 1230 million fruro the 
Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program and certain health care protosioos 
programs, arid freeie other financial aid at fiscal IMS levels. 

The committee's entire budget proposal sbojld reach the full Senate lor 
dlsciaslon sometime this sixins or early summer. 

"We're In a 'pay me now or pay me later' poaltiai with the federal budget," 
explains Bruce Post of the Senate EducltioD Subcommittee "We have to gel a 
handle on the deflcilarihere'ilbeblgprcblemsahead" 

"Someow has to do somelhlng about tbe deficit, so the Senate Is leafing tbe 
way."beadda. 

Serate Demoovts argue tbe proposed cuts won't save as much as (be 
Republicans say, tnit "tbe committee wanted (o meet a defldt reduction target," 
Post says. "We'll have to wilt til] the real world intrulea to see if Ihe estimates are 
righl Deficit forecasting Isn't an accurate art" 

Labor and Human Resources SubccsnmitteclSialnTun Sen. Robert Stafford IR- 
VI) recommended ibe freeze and tbe C;SL cuts. 

"He's pleased." Pfst says, "and the Ugher educalloo cammucity essentially 

But the plan was Just tbe nrst one. Eves with much. Congress woo' t write a rmal 
aid plan until October. 



"It's loo early to tell what the Senate's Rnal propcaal w 
Saunders of ihe American Council on Education. "There'll I 
to lncrcaselundl[«when He bill hits the Senate floor" 

"Tbe best thing." he points out. "is ibe committee rejected the prealdenfa 
recommendations on student aid and generally Imposed (he. freeze at curreol 
levels." 

But "the Senate recommendations don't recognlie the real needs In Ufber 
education or the appropriate federal respcDse." claima House EdicaUoo Sub- 
commi ttee I lalf director Tom Wo ianln. 

"The tremendous erosion In grants and Increased rellamx on loana la reducing 
opporhiUtlei and creating a new class of student deb ton." he say*. "Tttae plant 
tbe seeds of serious protilems down the road" 

Wolaoln contends be doesn't "know what the House sut&gt;commlttea wlD do. 
They're waiting to see what the Senate proposals do on the floor before tbcy get 

"Our subcommittee will encourage Ihe House not to follint the Senate patlen," 
he Inslsta. 

"Tbelr proposed ROD million culln CSLs will be difficult to acctanpllsfa witboul

If so, then you would want 
to fill out the lop piirllon of 
your petition regarding a

(SUBOG) ralher than

Washlnglon DC. April 
1— Sbinncd. BewildoreU. 
Ffujlrated, 

In the waning seconds of 
VilUinovD's £644 defeat of 
Georgetown In the NCAA 
championship game, the 
campiu d ' Qebrgelown 
University was cloaked In 
utter disbelief A raucous 
celebration that had been so 
eagerly anliclpaled only 



swelled wl lb excl lemeot and 
confidence . In retrospect, 
pisslbly too much. A victory 
celebration was almost 
considered certain, and 
Hoy* Fallhlul seemed un- 
willing to enlerlatn the 
posslblllty Ihlnp would be 
any different 

I was fonunate enough to 
« watching (he title game In 

student apartment, smack 
n the middle of campus, 
midst 17 Georgetown 
snaUcs. This even Included

As the game wore on. a 
reeling of desperation began 
to set In. GeorgeUnvn was 
supposed to make quick 
work of the Wildcats. What 
was happening? No one In 
this apartment knew the 



repeatedly fall InaltempUng 
to avert the upset, were very 
tense In Ihls apartmenl. 
These sbjden la. many dad In 
G-lovn regalia, were now 
face-to-face wllh Ihe 
unimaginable; the cnim- 
bllng 4 their dynasty. The 
atmosphere seemed divided 
by sbjnned silence and 
frusb-ated ihojls, and even 
the Jesuit priest was mut- 
tering In disgust (Wbocould 
blame him?) 

Earlier In this tour-

such animosity that may 

microscopic compared lo 
this night. As the game 
ended, no one was exactly 
sure what lo do. 11 was very 
quiet and everybody seemed 
to be bumping Into each 
other This silence was 
broken by Ihe collision of the 
television and a brick wall 



saying very little, shaking 
their heads. The night sky 
was dark and the wind was 
whipping. An air-raid 
walling In the background 
would not have been out of 
place. Hdw could this 
poislbly have happened? 

Some tried to consde each 
other, saying, "Hey, It was a 

great game." But It didn't 
seem lo work. They had iMl,

yanked out from underneath
