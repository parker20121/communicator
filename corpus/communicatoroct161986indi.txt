IPFW needs united effort to help community 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Editor-in-Chief 

In one month, IPFW has campaigned 
for and received pledges for about half 
of the goal set for United Way con- 
tributions. 

On Sept. 16, the campaign for con- 
tributions began at IPFW with a goal 
of aboul 521,300 set, according to 
Marian Adair, coordinator for the 
campaign, 

Adair, who also serves as the 
university's director of career services, 
said that presently the faculty and staff 
are half-way toward meeting that goal 
Right now, ISO people have made 



pledges for a combined total ol 512,000 
All of the pledges were supposed to 
have been lurned in by yesterday, but 
Adair said the deadline has been ex- 
tended lo.Oct. 25th. 

The figure of $21,300 is aboul a seven 
percent increase from the dollar 
amount given to United Way last year. 
The chancellor staled in a memo (dated 
Sept 161 distributed to all faculty and 
staff that he would also like to see the 
number of IPFW donations increase by 
IS percent. 

Although none of the money that is 
given lo United Way directly funds 



anything al IPFW, many of the IPFW 
students, faculty and staff benefit from 
ihe programs that the organization 
does fund Many of the IPFW com- 
munity members are involved as 
volunteers for United Way. They serve 
as solicitors for donations, campaign 
chairpersons, or on committees 
reviewing expenditures of agencies 
United Way funds. 

Some of the organizations funded by 
United Way are the Allen County 
Cancer Society, the Alien County 
Council on Aging, Big Brolhers-Big 
Sisters, Boy Scouts of America, 
Catholic Social Service, Goodwill In- 



dustries, the Fort Wayne Women's 
Bureau, Park Center. Inc.. Salvation 
Army, Switchboard, Inc., the YMCA 
and the YWCA. 

What is good aboul United Way, 
Adair said, "is lhat it's one of the lew 
campaigns where every dollar is used. 
They're very good about the utilization 
of funds " 

Adair said there are a few ways a 
faculty or staff member can make a 
United Way contribution: 11 a payroll 
deduction; 21 a flat, one-time con- 
tribution, or 3&gt; promise to pledge, but

Illiteracy difficult topic 
for many to understand 



By STACY SCHAAB 
Staff writer 

Although many may not believe ihis 
fact, it is a fact lhat requires attention: 
in elementary education, the teachers 
rely on the parents to assist their 
children on lessons. But whal happens 
when the parents cannot read? The 
child suffers. 

How is society helping its illiterates? 
Together, all federal, state, municipal, 
and private literacy programs in the 
nation reach a minimum of four per- 
cent of the illiterate population. The 
federal government spends SIOO million 
yearly to address the needs of 60 million 
people. President Reagan has 
requested that this amount be reduced 
to S50 million. Even at the present level, 
direct federal allocations represent 
approximately Sl.65 per year for each 
illiterate. 

A conference on illiteracy will be 
conducted at IPFW on Nov. 11' The 
focus of Ihe conference is to alert Ihe 
public of Ihis problem. For more in- 



formation on attending the conference, 
contact Ann Dirkes at the IPFW 
Division of Education. 

"We would like to alert the com- 
munity of this problem and help people 
who would like to learn lo read and 
write," Dirkes said 

"The largest numbers of illiterate 
adults are white, native-born 
Americans In proportion to population, 
however, the figures are higher for 
blacks and Hispanics than for whites. 
Sixteen percent of blacks and 56 per- 
cent of Hispanic citizens are functional 
or marginal illiterates," according to 
Jonathan Kozol, author of "Illiteracy in 
America." 

Most illiterates are of the low income 
bracket and cannot afford private 
tutoring In Fort Wayne there Is a 
pruexam whereby volunteers attend 
workshops and then tutor a student 
from one to two hours per week. Do you 
have ihe lime? Would you like to help'' 
If so, please contact the IPFW Division 
of Education.

By JANNET U 1 1 

Staff writer 

LooktotheskiesonNov.l and you'll sec the clouds blended with lu.oou balloons,

Lois Eubanks, who is on the Executive Board of the Allen County Arthritis 
Foundation, also serves as co-chairman of the event, known as "Up, up, and away

Foundation goes lo reserve one balloon. Donate $5, and five balloons will be 
launched. You can reservea balloon by calling the Foundation. 

A portion of the funds raised will be going to the National level, which, in turn, 
goes lo research. Another portion goes lo the stale level and Ihe remainder lo the 
local level. 

The Arthritis Foundation is attempting lo set a world's record by having the 
largest simultaneous launch spread across the U S. Fort Wayne is just one of the 
cities participating in the Northern Indiana area. Others are: Columbia City, 
Huntington and Warsaw. 



Eubank says the goal for Fort Wayne is 510,000 The event begins al 8 a.m. on 
Saturday. Nov. 1, at the downtown location of Wendy's Restaurant. The balloons 
will be launched at 3 p.m. by Miss Fort Wayne, Terri Bade, from a van donated by 
North American Van Lines. 

Eubank stressed the need for volunteers lo help inflate balloons using the 15 
tanks of helium available. Volunteers are also needed lo assist in tying theballons 
anil loading them into the van for Ihe launch. If you'd like lo donate your time, you 
can show up at Wendy's after B a.m. or call the Foundation to find out where your 
help is most needed. Eubanks would like to see some groups do fundraising ac- 
tivities, such as fraternities having a bake sale and donating (he funds raised to the 
launch , 

Arthritis doesn't just affect Ihe elderly. It is an affliction that hits children and 
young people as well. And while there are no available cures, there arc means lo

Placement office gives 
you the break you need 

" — in everyone's mind as Businesses involved include: Ball 



alie (Communicator 



Thursday, Oct. 16, 1986 



One thing on everyone's mind as 
graduation approaches is acquiring 
gainful employment. As a matter of fact, 
it may be our greatest worry. 

If you feel that you need some help, or 
you're a little nervous about entering 
"the real world" don't hesitate to give 
[he IPFW placement office a call. 

What? You don' t know what, or where, 
the placement office is? The IPFW 
placement office is a free service 
available to all IPFW graduates. Their 
goal is to assist you in getting in touch 
with employers who have career 
opportunities. The "where" is Walb 
Memorial Union, Suite 113. 

How can you use the placement 
service to benefit you most? To begin 
with, you must enroll with the office. 
You should enroll the semester prior to 
your semester of graduation ,, if you are 
to graduate in Fall 1987, enroll in Spring 
1987. To enroll, you need to fill out a 
computer card, listing positions that you 
desire and competencies you possess 
You will also be required to fill out a 
release form for the placement office so 
they can distribute your resume. An 
unofficial copy of your transcript will 
also be needed. 

Then what? The placement office can 
provide many things to a job hunter. So 
far this semester, they've sponsored 
resume writing workshops, a guide for 
cover letter formats, interviewing 
workshops, and a dress-for-interviewing 
seminar. A guide on "Tips for Your 
Executive Wardrobe" is also available 
in the placement office. Different times 
throughouf the year they will sponsor on- 
campus interviewing and recruiting. 



Businesses involved include: Ball 
Memorial Hospital, Chemical 
Engineering Corporation, Anthony 
Wayne Bank, MCI Telecommunication 
Operations, Parkview Memorial 
Hospital, Bristol-Myers, North 
American Van Lines, Phelps Dodge 
Magnet Wire Company, ITT Aerospace- 
Optical Division, and Navistar. 

The office offers other things to aid in 
your career search: employer literature 
files, college placement annuals, area 
business and industry directories, 
counseling, internship-co-op 
information, and job posting from local, 
state, and national companies. There is 
virtually no area left uncovered. 

To top it all off, you gain valuable 
knowledge that will last a lifetime, and 
at the placement office you can always 
go back to get help, service and advice. 
There has got to be a catch, right? 
Wrong! Can you believe something this 
good — and totally free is offered at 
IPFW? 

What won't they do for you? They 
won't get you a job. You must do that 
yourself. But with all they do offer, how 
can you go wrong? In the 1985-86 
placement services annual report, 
approximately 75 percent of IPFW 
students are placed within six months of 
graduation. Take into account that's 75 
percent of all who sign up. So why not 
give them a chance to help you? 

If you are serious about getting a job. 
all you have to do is visit the placement 
office. They will offer you services to 
enrich and add to the excitement of your 
job search — and to reduce some of the 
frustration. How can you go wrong? 




Student union situation 
requires investigation 



Hunger... still an international problem 



Have you wondered if IPFW is 
somehow cursed with the problem of an 
underutilized, yet beautiful, union 
building? Have you wondered what type 
of activities or promotions would draw 
masses o( students to the building, 
rather than Kettler Hall? 

IPFW is not alone Other campuses 
across the state have more elaborate 
student unions than we, yet still have the 
same problems. 

For example, look at IU-South Bend 
and their campus. Although they do no) 
have a union building, they do have an 
area where students can gather in the 
main administration building. On the 
first floor is a student association 
"room," housing offices and a game 
room. Also on that floor is a quiet study 
room and a cafeteria. Administrative 
offices are located on the second floor. 
Classrooms and the campus mailroom 
can be found in the lower level. 

The Indiana University-Purdue 
University at Indianapolis campus is a 
different story. Their student union 
houses, among other things, a swimming 
pool. There is a cafeteria for students, 
faculty and staff and a ticket office for 
the purchase of local cinema tickets and 
Bloomington football and basketball 
tickets. Five meeting rooms for faculty 
and student organizations are available, 
but there is no office space with the 
exception of Continuing Education, 
located in the basement of that building. 
Something else appears in the IUPUI 
budding that, except for the Sweet 
Shoppe, is not available at IPFW. There, 
commercial enterprises do business in 
the union: a barbershop and a hotel. The 
hotel has 25 rooms and a dining room- 
cafe — complete with waiters and 
waitresses. According to the student 
activities director, Mike Wagoner, this is 



mainly available to faculty members. 
In the same building, auxiliary 
enterprises are also housed: a 
bookstore, cafeteria, credit union and 
the alumni office. Just like IPFW? No! 
At IPFW, the cafeteria is the only 
simitar service available in the union. 
The bookstore, credit union and alumni 
office are in Kettler Hall. 

Even though there are minor 
differences between the three campuses 
and their union buildings, there is one 
similarity. Each has their own problems 
of attracting students to use the building. 
IUSB doesn't have a lot of students 
gathering in their administration 
building. In Indianapolis, where the 
offerings abound to even a swimming 
pool, the students still seem to 
congregate in other places At neither of 
these campuses is the union the sole 
meeting place for students. The same 
holds true at IPFW 

It seems you could have red carpets 
rolled out, VIP parking and valets and 
still students would not use the Union. 
Before any changes are made to the 
current set-up of Walb or Kettler, a 
detailed study should be done to 
determine specific faculty-student 
needs Only after that should decisions 
be made regarding changes to the 
physical make-up of either building. 

It is apparent other schools suffer 
from the underutilization of their student 
union buildings. With careful research 
and planning, perhaps IPFW can 
become an example to other campuses. 
It is good to finally have an 
administration willing to make changes 
for the good of the students, rather than 
for other more selfish reasons. But don't 
make the decisions loo hastily or with 
input from only a few who would not be 
affected by any changes to Walb 
Memorial Union building.

HUNGER APPEAL 
World Food Day gives us 
an opportunity to consider 
some facts related to global 
hunger. Presently, some five 
hundred million people 
experience hunger on a 
continuing basis, that is, one 
out of every ten people on 
planet Earth, approximately 
3omillion people in America 
The average person in the 
developed world consumes 
more than 3,000 calories a 
day while a person in the 
developing world gets about 
2,000 calories It should be 
remembered that a body at 
rest needs 1,600 calories 
dally. 

In rural areas of poor 
countries, the caloric intake 
of people is well below the 
required 1,600. There were 
long periods during the 
Ethiopian famine when a 
person received less than BOO 
calories a day Needless to 

rampant, starvation and 
death common, especially 
among children under five 



and expecting and lactaling 
mothers. 
For a variety of reasons, 

Commentary 

mostly man-made, the lives 
of some ZOO million people in 
Africa will be threatened for 
years to come because of 
severe food shortages Weak 
political structures, cultural

agricultural policies, and 
economic exploitation are 
some of the causes that ef- 
fect the lives of the poor who 

However, there is enough 
food produced each year in 
the world to feed every

Student's Government, 
represented by Studenl 
Senalor Steve Elser, 
researched the feasibility of 
requesting an extension of 
those hours. 

Elser met with the 
Multipurpose Building ad- 
ministration, soliciting their 



and 



■ strain 



relative to expanding the 
Athletic Center hours After 
Student's Government had a 
belter understanding of the 
unique situation of the 
Athletic Center, I contacted 
the university's central 
administration — then 
Acting Chancellor, Dr. 
Edward Nicholson and Vice 
Chancellor of Financial 
Affairs, Mr. John Carnaghi. 
Both Dr. Nicholson and Mr 
Carnaghi were very 
receptive to the idea and 
have been very involved in 
causing the initiation of the 
program. Dr. Skelton, and 
his Multipurpose Building 
administrative slaff have 
also received Ihe idea wilh 
enthusiasm and are 
currently involved in 
promoting Ihe expanded 
hours Our new Chancellor, 
Dr Thomas Wallace has 
seen lo il thai the extended 
hours program be enacted as 
soon as possible. Dr Wallace 
has been a vocal supporter of 

programs, including this 
one. Student's Government 
owes all of these people, and 
others, a warm thank you for 



their personal lime and 

support 

Now it's up to the Student 
Body to support these new 
hours and thereby help prove 
that these extended hours 
should be made permanent. 
Your use of the Multipurpose 
Building, your facility, is 
critical to the success of the 
entire project. We all have 
worked hard to make sure 
the students are served — so 
how about participating! ! 

The second example has to 
do with a student complaint 
that Student's Government 
received Iwo weeks ago. A 
particular student had 
complained that she had 
received a parking ticket 
while parked in Lot 6, next to 
Ihe Library. She felt that 
because of personal safety 
concerns that Lot 6 should 
change (o AB parking after 
sundown, instead of being 
restricted to A parking. 
Student's Government had 
tried such a change last year 
— unsuccessfully. This time 
we want to make sure that 
the students are behind us 
before we request that 
change. Student Senator Jeff 



Don) 



has 



resolution pertaining to that 
change contingent upon the 
opinion of (he students. The 
resolution includes a 
petition which has been 
displayed in the Student's 
Government office Studenls 
may support this petition 
located in Walb room 225 If 
any interested students wish 
to circulate copies of the 
petition among (he student 
body. Student's Government 
will provide them with 

Participation, that's the 
key. Several students who 
originally voiced student 
concerns are now either 
Sludent Senators or mem- 
bers ol the Student Union 
Board of Governors. I ap- 
plaud the efforts of those 
studenls who become in- 
volved and 1 ask thai the 
efforts of those students who 
become involved and I ask 
that Ihe rest of the student 
population consider the 
same. Thank you.

Be a Big

By NATALIE ALCOX 

Features Editor 

There are more than 13 
nillion children growing up 
n single-parent homes ii 
US. These children ar

program of greater Fort 
Wayne can help. 

I Brothers-Big Sisters 

provides iriendships for 

children ages 7-17 

idults. The Fort Wayne 

hapLer has paired over 550

Unfortunately, there are 
it enough volunteers

Many people seem to feel 
that to be a Big Brother or

At last... a solution for football widows 




'Tackling Football'' stars Tim Wright man of the Chicago 
Bears, and actress Lois Hall and comedian Tom Dreesen in 
an entertaining home video (photo courtesy of MPI Home 



By NATALIE ALCOX 
Features Editor 
Are you a football widow? 
Orphan? Boy-Girlfriend? 
Then this videotape is for 
you! "Tackling Football: A 
Woman's Guide to Watching 
the Game" is the how-to 
book for those who do not 
understand the game and 
hence find it exceedingly 

Unfortunately in most 
instances, this is not the 
case. It's not that they don't 
understand the game, they 
just don't like it. 

For those, however, who 
would like to know more 
about the game, this forty 
minute video presented by 
the Football Widows of 
America could be a real 
asset It answers questions 
like: 

1) What is the main objeel 
of football? 

2) What is meant by the 
line of scrimmage and where 
is it located on the field? 

3) What is the offense? 

4) What does the light end 
do? 

SI What is the defense? 

6&gt; Since every game starts 
off with a kickoff, are there 
any strategies used? 

71 What is an I formation? 

B) What is meant by 
"going in motion - '" 

9) What is meant by a 
"sweep play?" 

10) Do all the teams use 
the same basic plays 9 

11) How do you make a 
touchdown? How many 



points do you get for a touch- ball game. This is obviously 



12) What are those players 
doing in the huddle? 

13) Do the players on the 
line of scrimmage ever talk 
to each other? 

14) What is a fumble? 
These and many other 

questions like them are 
answered in the video. 

Dillon Smith of Dillon 
Smith Communications, 
publisher of the video, 
claims that women do not 
understand football, 
"because culturally she 
hasn't been exposed to 
football the same way men 
have — she's never played 

And whose fault is that? It 
most certainly is not the 
woman's fault She has tried 
diligently to comprehend 
men's games, hut somehow 
she cannot see the poinl m 
sending forty-four people out 
onto a field with the sole 
purpose being to break each 
other's neck, and to selec- 
tively break bones: for 
example a blue and gold 
uniformed person does not 
try lo hurt another blue and 
gold uniformed person. 

Furthermore, realistically 
speaking, how many of the 
millions of armchair 
quarterbacks have ever been 
on a football held 9 Dillon 
Smith Communications has 
been sadly misinformed if 
they believe that every man 
watching a football game 
has actually played a foot- 




Whatever made Dillon 
Smith believe that women 
have no inkling in how 
football is played 7 Of course 
women know how it's 
played! The real question is: 
Do we care? 

The answer is very 
probably, "Not really." 

Unlike men, women 
outgrow childhood games 
They get on with the real 
business of living. This is noi 
true of men. Mass media is 
helping men hold onto their 
childhoods longer, right up lo 
when they are on their death 
beds. Just flick on the TV 
any night of the week and if 
it's not football, it's 
basketball or wrestling or 
the World Series or any 
number of "sports," These 
programs are obviously not 
directed at women. Just look 
at the ads 

Almost all of the actors are 
male The only females a 
person sees during a 
televised sport are the 
cheerleaders and pert little 
redheads handing out beer 
bottles. It doesn't take a lot 
of brain power to figure ou! 
[hat spurls are not really 
addressed to women. What 
women would tune in to 
watch her gender be 
degraded? 

There will still be those, 
however, that feel it shows 
some loyalty to at least try to 
understand the game. For 
Ihose unfortunates, this 
video is for you. But, think 
about this: Would he go lo 
the trouble to understand the 
motivation behind shopping? 

The answer is clear

Domestic quarrels that 
result in violence are very 
common m the U.S. Today, 
six million American 
women, in all walks of life, 
are beaten by their domestic 
partners Four thousand are 
killed. Battering is the single 
major cause of injury to 
women, exceeding rapes, 
muggings and even auto 
accidents Battering 
precipitates one in every 
four suicide attempts by all 
women, and one half of all 
suicides by black women. 
Thirty percent of female 
homicide victims are killed 
by their husbands or 
boyfriends. 

Society today is respon- 
sible for the epidemic of 
battered women. Men are 
taught to "stand up and fight 
like a man" and show their 
appropriate feelings towards 



this 



way. 



Domination which primarily 
determines self-worth is also 
responsible for the battering 
of women in society. 

We are (aught to be 
ruthless in business with 
"killer instinct"; in sports 
"winning is not the most 
important thing, it's the only 
thing", the movies show 
violence is acceptable and 
macho. Even us Americans, 
we tend to think we can bully 
and control weaker nations. 

The men who feel they 
must dominate their spouses 
end up as statistics for 
battered and abused women. 
About half Ihe couples in (his 
country have experienced 
violence in an intimate 
relationship. Twenty-five 
percent of the couples in this 
country are estimated to be 
violent relationships. Some 
men feel itis their duly to 
keep their wives in line, 

mm 

WHERE AMERICA 



Women who are battered 
may be verbally abused, 
kicked, punched, thrown 
around or knifed. They may 
have minor injuries, or they 
may have very serious in- 
juries or even killed. Women 
may have broken ribs, 
concussions, permanent 
brain injuries, hearing loss, 
and miscarriages as a result 
of beatings. 

Rape in marriage is very 
common and is a form of 
abuse. Not many marital 
rapes are actually reported 
because of the definition of 
rape. Rape is defined as 
intercourse through force or 
threat of force without 
consent of the woman, other 
than one's wife Because of 
this delinition. marital rape 
legally is non-existent. 

There is help for battered 
women in this area. The 
YWCA offers a Shelter for 
Women Victims of Violence. 
The Shelter also offers a 
hotline which is designed to 
advise and listen to women. 
The hotline, open twenty- 
four hours a day, is at 447- 
8666.

Consistency falters as soccer 
team runs into rough action 



By JENNY Bll/VKI.EY 
Staff Writer 

"We have proven we can 
play against anyone," 
Soccer Coach Jim Sharpe 
comments. Unfortunately, 
the Mastodons have en- 
countered some tough 
breaks in their season. The 
kickers have compiled a 5-4-1 
record, competing against 
some difficult teams. "We 
have already played our 
toughest games," said 
sophomore Mark Coffee, a 
fullback. 

The opposition has indeed 
been rough, with an earlier 
defeat by Oakland 
University, then the number 
rive team in the nation in 
Division Two, and a loss last 
Saturday at the hands of 
Lewis University, ranked 
number three in Division 
two.

Chicago fell short for the 
Mastodons, losing 4-1 to 
Lewis. "No one had their 
head into the (Lewis) 
game," Sharpe says "There 
were a couple of bad breaks 
(with the referee), but that's 
no excuse, we still didn't 
play very well." Sharpe 
adds, "The concentration 
level was low." 

Freshman defensive back 
Mark Zumbraegel, assessing 
(he team's performance, 
adds, "It was not a good 
game. The intensity level 
was really down during the 

The Mastodons enjoyed a 
victory the week before, 
however, defeating Grace 
College, 2-1 Regardless of 
the team's success, Sharpe, 
in retrospect, is still skep- 
tical. "There were stretches 
where we played well, but we 
didn't play real well for the 
whole game." 

Consistency is a key factor 
to a team's success. The 
Mastodons' inconsistency, in 
ihe Grace match as well as 
in other contests, is a major 
facet that requires im- 
provement. "One of our 
weaknesses is the (in- 
consistency of play," states 
Sharpe. "We need to keep 
our concentration up," 

Zumbraegel echoes 
Sharpe's thoughts. "We have

played in spurts, which has 
hurt us." Zumbraegel 
comments. "Wemust play to 
our potential for Ihe full 
game." 

Coffee agrees: "We 
proved that we can play 
against some of the best 
teams in the region, but we 
are not very consistent." 

In assessing the overall 
team, Sharpe lists a positive 
characteristic as the team's 
talent, but mentions several 
areas needing betterment. 
"We are strong up the 
middle, and our midfield is 
good. Also, offensively, we 
have good skills. But 
defensively we are in- 
consistent at times," Sharpe 
alleges. "There is not a lot of 
patience or control, but 
we're getting better. 
Sometimes it's frustrating, 
because we have so much 
potential. Our players need 
to put everything together 
for an entire 90 minutes." 

Coffee lists a strong point 
as the team's experience. 
"We have a lot of older 
players (there are four 
seniors on the team). They 
provide good leadership" 
Two of the seniors, Bronn 
Pfieffer and Juan Diaz, 
placed on the Great Lakes 
Valley Conference (GLVC) 
All-Conference team last 
season. 

However, Coffee adds, the 
team's weaknesses include 
"not much depth. We start 
eleven, and there are three 
subs. You don't have the 
luxury of rotating, and 
putting in a lot of guys," 
Coffee slates. 

Zumbraegel adds that a 




major improvement 
necessitates increasing the 

enthusiasm. "Skillwise. 
we're okay, but we need to 
improve our intensity level." 

An increase in the en- 
thusiasm from fans is a 
necessity to improve ihe 
team as well. Sharpe 
comments, "We need people 
to come out to our games!" 

Zumbraegel adds, "We 
need crowd support, and the 
supporl of the ad- 
ministration." 

Coffee also stales, "We 
have the best facilities 
around. Our competition is 
great, but there is not enough 
supporl."

great problem for TPFW,

high expectations for the

The member schools of Ihe 
Great Lakes Valley Con- 
ference have approved the 
use of the three-point field 
goal in women's conference 
basketball games on an 
experimental basis for the

adopted at the GLVC's an- 
nual fall meetings conducted 
at the University of In- 
dianapolis, Sept. 25 and 26.
