Voters still a necessity 
in uncontested election 

For democracy's sake, if for no other reason, we should 
hold a Students' Government election. Actually, with the 
offices of president, vice president of legislation, vice 
president of finance, and vice president of Student Ac- 
tivities Board (SAB) all uncontested, we don't need to go 
through the expense and trouble of an election. An an- 
notating ceremony would be simpler. 

Although simpler and less expensive, an annointing 
ceremony is not what democracy is all about, so an 
election we will have. This election, no matter how poor a 
turnout of the student voter, will confirm the candidates in 
their respective offices. 

According to Kristina Frazier-Henry, vice president of 
student legislation, write-in candidates are allowed. Now 
there's a frightening thought. With unopposed candidates 
and a poor voter turnout, any deranged idiot with a cult 
following could become a write-in candidate, and win. 

Just what this campus needs, more insanity in the 
offices of Students' Government, and a further deteriora- 
tion of the student body's involvement in University ac- 
tivities. 

Yes, this is a commuter campus. Yes, we are too busy 
to care about "such nonsense," but unless we start caring, 
the leaders of this campus will not respect us as students, 
and our rights will be poorly represented or not repre- 
sented at all. 

Without our input, the Students' Government could 
quickly become a self-serving device to a small faction of 
students who are clever enough to take advantage of the 
situation. 

Students' Government is responsible for spending a 
quarter of a million dollars of our money. Ideally, this 
money would be spent on student activities, but it doesn't 
)e. Our student service fees, as well as our 
representation, could be misused and misplaced if we do 
not take that extra minute to vote for the legitimate 
candidates who have placed their names on the ballot for 
all to see and know. 

On April 23 and 24, come to campus a little early, or 
stay a few minutes after class to vote for Dan Pulley, 
candidate for student body president; Kristina Frazier- 
Henry, candidate for vice-president of student legislation; 
Lisa Onz, candidate for vice president of SAB; and Dan 
Reese, candidate for vice president of finance.
