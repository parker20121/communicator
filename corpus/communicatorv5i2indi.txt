By MARK FRANKE 

Support for Senate Bill 261, along with 
(he addition of certain key amendments, 
was voiced by a panel of Indiana-Purdue 
University faculty members last Tuesday 
afternoon in a symposium on collective 
bargaining, sponsered by the local chapter 
of the American Association of University 

Sitting on the panel was Dr. Clifford 
Scott, assistant professor of history, Ruth 
B. Kerns, reference librarian. Dr. Anne 
RUdd, Assistant Professor of French, Dr. 
Stephen P. Harroff. assistant professor of 
German. Dr. David P. Onwood, associate 
professor of chemistry, Richard E. Hill, 
associate professor ot supervision, and Dr. 
Raymond S. Wilkes, assistant professor of 

Senate Bill 261 is an omnibus bill gran- 
ting the right of collective bargaining toall 
public employees in i he stale of Indiana. 
Included in this bill is university faculty 
and staff. At present, S26I is under con- 
sideration by Indiana House of Represen- 
tatives, where it has been assigned to the 
Committee on Roads and Transportation. 

It was the consensus of the symposium 
participants that university faculty needed 
collective bargaining as a means to certain 
ends. In addition to economic and em- 
ployment considerations, the panel 
members saw collective bargaining as a 
tool for shaping educalional policy.

Summing up the prospects for a collec- 
tive bargaining bill in the General Assem- 
bly, Dr. Scott, president-elect of the In- 
diana Federation of AAUP Chapters, 
said, "All in all, the prospects look good 
for a bill to go through the legislature." 
But he hastily added that exactly which 
bill and what form was yet to be 
determined. 

Dr. Scott suggested that S26I had the 
best chance of passing the legislature. He 
urged local faculty to be careful in their 
rhetoric when lobbying for the bill, and to

So how do these things effect the In- 
diana-Purdue student? First, ap- 
proximately 2Q% of the students on this 
campus are recipients of financial aids. 
Many of them find these funds a necessity 
to pay for college expenses. 

As il becomes increasingly harder to 
qualify for a loan, many are having to 
forego their education, or limit it to a part

CHARACTER fc OPINION 



Blue flares in Currituck County 



Price of books 

There is yet to be the student that has not thought he was being gorged by the 
price of books each semester Books a.e an expensive part of the educational 
process, but the blame for this unnecessary expense is usually misplaced. 

The campus bookstore is a passive instrument in the price-setting process. 
The prices of new books are pre-set by the publisher. Used books arc priced at a 
straight 75% of the new book value. 

Likewise, the APO book exchange does not arbitrarily set prices on the used 
books in which it deals. Following thecxnmplc of the bookstore, the fraternity 
uses the 75% rule in its price determination process. 

The fact that the campus agents arc more or less price-takers docs not make 
the high prices any easier to bear. Books arc over priced by the publishers at 
student expense. 

One reason for this that comes to mind logically is the great expense of the 
promotional activities of the publishers. Each publisher has a huge mailing list 
for complimentary copies of its new books. For example when a new sociology 
book is published, every sociology professor on the mailing list receives a free 
copy. The intent is to impress the prof with the book so that he requires it for 
one or more of his classes. The cost of this promotion is then passed on to the 

Book prices are too high, but the fault lies not with the bookstore or the book 
exchange Students migght bear in mind where this blame really belongs, so 
that their frustration might he directed toward the t;ue culprit. 

Involvement 

Interwoven with despair, the thoughts of students ramble through all scopes of 
campus activities only to find yet one more event in which they cannot participate 

Student activity docs not begin with the university, it begins with the individual 
student. Each student must decide if he wants to become actively involved with the 
campus. Once the student takes thisfirsicnhc.il step he will find there are things to 
do on campus besides going to classes. 

The size of the campus plays little, if any, role in determining the range of ac- 
tivities available to the student In fact, the most impi.irt.itil factor involved is the 
atmosphere the students themselves create. For the most part, the present al- 
mo-phercol this campus is a very poor one. Most students seem to come and go 
from their classes without coring about the campus itself Perhaps this is the root 
cause lor the over-all high school impression ih.it this campus leaves upon its 

The Student Union gives the campus what it really needs to erase the present at- 
mosphere. First, the Union gives students a place to go. and a place to do almost 
anything a person would want to do on campus Second, it gives a start to student 
happenings. 

Students can use facilities such as the art rooms provided on the second floor of 
the Union. Tho-e students interested in photography, or interested in starting, 
have a darkroom at their disposal. In the Union there will be concerts, dances, 
speakersand many olhct thing' that .1 student can Income involved in. 

Students can attend PIT productions such as the upcoming "Man of LaMan- 
cha" to be given on September 7; students can also view movies offered by the 
Students' Government film series (the first movie being the award winning 
"Summer of '42"{. These activates are available 10 all activity card holders free. 

There also exist several types of clubs on campus. Persons wishing to just waste 
time, as well as those interested in furthering their education can join these clubs 
such as the hiolog\ club, psychology club and the foreign languane clubs are just a 
few of the group activities m which a student could readily find helpif he were 
having difficulty in a particular subject. All one must do to get into the club, or to 
find out if there is a club in a particulararea, is to ask his instructor. Chancesare 
that hs instructor is actively involved in the club already. 

Clubs and activities arc not hard to find on this campus if there is an interest. 
Most of the activities are free too, so that the student who has just paid his fees and 
bought his books can still afford them. 

If you have ever noticed how much more interesting something is when more 
persons become involved in it, then you can rcadilyimagine how much more 
interest ing this campus could be if all. or even half, the students would become in- 
volved in some activity. 

Quite frankly, if the students on this campus would emerge from their cacoons 
to take pan in the abundant campus activities, this campus would become a much 
more interesting place. As students begin to do this, people will be able to find 
many activities in progress, and become aware that these are an integral part of IU-

The 1973 World University Games ended in Moscow last week with the trip 
home being sweet for sonic Ann.-nL.in athletes urn.) disappointing for others.

United Slates had to offer Various hassles kepi us from sending our bcst.imalcur 
athletes into competition. 

The basketball segment of the Games was by far what everyone in the Stales was 
watching the most. Even the casual sports fan must remember the championship 
game of the 1972 Olympics. The U.S. cagers fought back from an early deficit to 
apparently shade the Russian entry 50-49, But after lime had runout, Russian star 
Belov sank a lay-up. The incompetent officials allowed (he bucket, and Russia

Cubans when defeat was inevitable. 

Thus the stage was set a week ago for the long-a wailed rematch between the U.S. 



and S,v

FAREWELL TO A LEGEND 

Whal can one way about the incomparable Willie Mays'' I he "Say Hey" kid is 
now in his earh forties and playing out his last season with ihe New York Mels. 

For over two decades Willie Was Mr Everything and became ihe idol of 
millions, black and white. Of course baseball now has its new superstars, but it is 
doubtful that a Bonds, Bench, or Dcdeno will ever approach the vast ac- 
complishments and popularity built up through so many years by Mays. 

Hank Aaron is the onl. legend still active, and lus pnpularitv and lame fall well 
short of that of marvelous Willie. Recently Mays hit home run number 660, 
leaving htm an unreachable 54 circuit clouts short of the Babe. 

This year Mays cannot play the outfield. His once deadly throwing arm is no 
longer effective. The base hits are few, and the home runs are rare. But as he make 
the last rounds of major league ballparks as an active player, the fans are showing 
just what they think of him. 

In San Francisco's Candle sin k Park recent l\. whenever Willie would even peep 
oul of the dugout, the fans would whip themselves into a frenzy. Batting practice in 
any park is a spectable, as fans beg for jus! an acknowledgement from Mr, Mays. 
And whenever Willie ambles to the plate, no matter what ballpark, score or 
situation, almost every fan clamors for a base hit or home run from the Man. 

Can Willie Mays make il as a black manager in the major leagues? Many think 
not, because, although popular with his leammatcs throughout his career. Mays' 
ability lo handle players remains doubtful. 

Mays was one of the greatest, both on the field and off. Oh, how he will be 

CELEBRITY BASEBALL 

Apparently NBC feels that Curt Gowdy and Tony Kubek don't have quite 
enough pizazz to handle a Monday rug hi baseball audience. So they are bringing in 
celebrities lo spice up the telecasts. 

Former broadcasting great Red Barber was excellent. But the others that this 
writer has seen have been utterly nauseating. Danny Kaye, Charlie Pride and 
George C. Scott were funny — when they not trying to be funny. 

To get Scott NBC probably had to pay him whal Kubek gels for a whole season. 
In addition they had to ng the game so the team Scott "lives and dies with," the 
Detroit Tigers, would win in a thriller I think I'm just kidding with the latter 



But last Monday's guest celebrity was just too much. The best 1 can say about 
Glen Campbell ("By ihe Time I Get to Phoenix"and "Gentle on My Mind") is that 
he is kind to his mother. 

A typical knowledgcrable exchange follows: 
Gowdy: "That Ferguson sure has been a great clutch hitter this year for the 



"Yessir 



. hec 



l the ball." 

Kubek: "Ferguson's power has been a " 

Glen: "Oooweee. a base hit, a base hit!" 

Gowdy: "Messersmilh has settled down now after thai wild streak." 

Glen: "Heck, that Smesserzit knows how to fire that ball." 

The highlight of the evening was when Glen Campbell's young son joined the 
crew in the telecasting booth. He stuck his longue out at the wrong camera and pin- 
ched Curt Gowdy before settling down and acting cool. 

This writer has a few picks for future guest spots on Monday night baseball: 
Gloria Steinem. Martha Mitchell. Hugh Hefner, Abbie Hoffman, and Balman. If 
you haven't caught any Monday mghi baseball extravaganzas, lune in next Mon- 
day night. But have plenty of Alka-Sehzer close by. 

NO MORE BALL IN D.C. 

It will be a catastrophe if the SanDiego Pares are allowed to move to 
Washington. The Washington Senators (now the Texas Rangers) never could 
draw in the Capilolcity. and neither would the hapless Padres. Bui ihere is more to 
Ihe move than the funure condition of the San Diego franchise.

a a few weeks, so my first column 

NFC WEST 

San Francisco — S.F. is the team to beat with Ihe return of veteran quarterba &lt; 
John Brodie and the 4th best offense in the NFC last year. Gene Washinglon 
pulled in 12 touchdown passes to lead the league and make the aerial attack deadly. 
Prediction: Barring injuries to key players, another divisional title. 
Atlanta — Bob Berry. 2nd best passer in the NFC last year, and the running of Art 
Malone and Dave Hampton helped lead Atlanta to one of its finest seasons in us 
history. The strong point of the team is the defense which topped the western 
division and finished 5th in the NFC last season. Prediction: Could give the 49'ers a 
run for the money. 

Los Angeles — Quarterback John Hadl, recently acquired from San Diego, is the 
key to the Rams attack. With the 3rd best offenseand 6th best defense last year the 
Rams could only manage six wins. New head coach Chuck Knox had better not get 
his hopes too high. Prediction: If Hadl can spark the Rams, Ihey mighl overtake 
Ihe 2nd place Falcons. 

New Orleans — Then there's the hapless Saints. Even if Archie Manning has a 
super season, the Saints will be lucky to win four games. Coach J.D. Roberts 
probably isn't looking a divisional title, bul is trying to win enough games to keep ' 
his job next year. Prediction: Dead last. 

NFC CENTRAL 
Green Bay — "The Pack is back," according lo coach Dan Devine and rightly so. 
Winning ten games last year, the Packers led Ihe NFC in team defense wilh a young 
bul skilled secondary led by Ken Ellis and Willie Buchanon. John Brockington 
and Mac Arthur Lane will head the running game while Scott Hunter and Jerry 
Tagge will battle for the QB spot. Prediction: All alone at the top. 
Minnesota — Fran is back in Minnesota and playing at his besl Tarkenton is the 
Key to whether the Vikings can regain the divisional ahamionship which alluded 
them last year. The Viking defense, which finished 3rd in the NFC, is led by All- 
Stars Alan Page and Carl Eller. Prediction: If the Vikings can gel a few breaks Ihey 
might surprise the Packers. 

Chicago — The Bears are coming off a disappointing 4-9-1 season and will be right 
in ihe thick of the race for 2nd place. The Bears will be facing some formidable foes 
in Denver, New Orleans, New England, and Houston and with a Tew upset vic- 
tories in intradivisional games, the Bears could break the .500 mark. Dick Butkus 
leads the defensive squad while the offense was led by Bobby Douglass who rushed 
for 968 yards— as a quarterback. Prediction: Because of their easy schedule, I rate 



the Bears 3rd. 

Detroit — The Lions, under 

divisional championship but 

(2nd in the NFC to San Francisco) 

question. The secondary is strong but the from four let opposing players 

yards— 2nd worst to Philadelphia. Prediction: No chance lo catch the Pack 



head coach Don McCafferly, will be looking fora 

The offense which put up 339 points 

than adequate but the defense is the ibg 



NFC EASTERN 

Washington — The "over the hill" gang should repeat as divisional champions 
especially with the return of Sonny Jurgcnson and the consistent running of NFC 
Mosl Valuable Player Larry Brown. Last year the defense allowed the fewest 
points (218) while scoring 336 points- — -2nd best to the Lions. Prediction: George 
Allen won't let the Super Bowl slip away again. 

Dallas - Last season the Dallas offense was ranked 2nd because of thegroundat- 
tack led by Walt Garrison and Calvin Hill and the passing of Craig Morton. The 
defense is once again led by All-Pro Bob Lilly and company. Prediction should 

ke the playoffs but only as the wildcard team. 
New York — With a revitalized Norm Sncad (Last season's No. I quarterback) 

' the running of Ron Johnson, the Giants won an impressive eight games lasi 
year. Prediction: It should be a fight with Philadelphia for last place. 
Philadelphia — The Eagles could manage only two victories while scoring the 
fewest points in the NFC last season (145). The bright spot of the team is All-Pro
