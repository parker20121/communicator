STEREO THIEF TARGETS 
STUDENT'S PARKED CAR 

Campus police are searching for sus- 
pecLs in a stereo equipment theft one week 
ago in a parking loi south of Kctiler HaJI, 
according to Lt. Tom Haner of the depan- 
ment of police and safety. 

In order to steal a pair of stereo speak- 
ers, valued at $40 eaih in the pohce report, 
the culprit broke the rear window of the car 
causing damage estimated at $145. said 
Haner. The theft, which occurred between 
10 and 11 p.m., was reported to the police 
Thursday night by the victim, an employee 
of the university. 

Haner said that while this theft was an 
isolated incident. student.s should exercise 
caution when parking on campus and 
should be sure to properly lock and secure 
their autos. 

Haner also advised campus drivers to 
lake extra precautions when parking this 
winter. 

"A lot of the collisions we investigate 
are caused by carelessness," said Haner, 
"You really need to pay attention in the 
parking lots, because there really aren't any 
markings and parking is on a first-come, 
first-serve basis." 

POLISH POLITICIAN SPEAKS 
ON NEW DEMOCRACY 

A specialist in the theory and practice of 
local government in Poland, visited IPFW 
and told students and faculty that Polish 
citizens are positive about changes in the 
Eastern Bloc. 

Pawel Swianiewicz, a professor at 
Warsaw University and an active member 
of local government in Poland, was on 
campus Friday. 

During his hour- 
long discussion of 
Polish government, 
Swianiewicz com- 
pared Polish and 
Hungarian govern- 
ment and the 
reforms made in 
those countries. 
Swianiewicz said 
that the local gov- 
ernment reforms of Central and East 
European countries are imponant trendset- 
ters for European government. 

"The level of understanding of local 
government problems does not depend on 
the sophistication of theoretical discussions 
and the quality of propaganda, but on the 
real, long experience of everyday life," 
Swianiewicz said. 

Swianiewicz plans to work as a visiting 
professor at the University of Chicago for 
the next year. 

ATHLETICS WANTS MONEY; 
IPSGA SAYS MAYBE 

Students' government opposes the "tax 
and spend" methods of the athletic depan- 
ment, said Rajat Suri, IPSGA president, at 
last Monday's student senate meeting. 

According to student senate polling, stu- 
dents do not want to pay a larger student 
service fee. 

"We do not want to burden the smdents in 
any fashion, and we are not against athlet- 
ics," added Suri. 

He said they are willing to work out a 
plan that is acceptable to IPSGA, the ath- 
letic depanment. and the students. 

The conflicts arose after the athletic 
depanment proposed a student service fee 
increase and a larger cut of the profits. 

Negotiations between IPSGA and the ath- 
letic depanment will continue. 

A follow-up story will appear in The 
Communicator next week updating the 
financial proposals and negotiations.

IPFW calls back spring Perkins loans 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

Only one third of the 700 stu- 
dents whose Perkins loans were 
canceled have opted for an alter- 
native plan, said Gina Roberts, 
financial aid director. 

Several weeks ago the finan- 
cial aid office recalled 700 loans 
for the spring scmesier. The 
loans ranged from S150 lo S750. 

Roberts said 40 percent of 
IPFW students receive some 
form of financial aid. Of that 40 
pctceni, 14 percent have Perkins 
loans. 

Former Perkins loan holders 
were offered the option of 



replacing the Perkins loan with 
a Stafford loan, or working with 
the financial aid office to find 
new funds. 

The loan recall, according to 
Roberts, was the result of an 
oversight by the financial aid 
office. 

Roberts said last year they 
undcr-uiiiizcd their financial 
resources. As a result, she said 
they made more aid available in 
larger amounts lo more students. 

It is impossible, she said, to 
predict how many students will 
accept and use financial aid. 

Roberts added, "It's a gamble 
wc must take every year. It is 



an unknown from our per- 
spective." 
IPFW was allocated a 

S578.000 level of spending for 
the '92-'93 school year from the 
govemmcni. 

"If they can't replace the 
loan, we are assisting 
them in finding other 
resources." 
-Gina Roberts 

Since they misjudged the 
number of Perkins loans lo be 
used, spring semester loans had 
lo be drastically cut. 

The cut in financial aid will 



not span beyond ihc spring 
semester, according to Roberts. 

"We arc working from a feder- 
al fund that is a limited amounL 
Wc can not overdraft that bud- 
get," explained Roberts. 

Prevention of an overdraft was 
the reason the Perkins loans 
were canceled, according to 
Robcru, 

Roberts said other options. 
besides the Perkins loan, arc 
available. IPFW is recommend- 
ing the Stafford loan. 

However, the aliemativc car- 
ries an interest rate of up to nine 
percent, versus about four per- 
cent with the Perkins, 



Tuition and books for an 
Indiana resident, according to 
Roberts, equal about S2.015. 
Out of stale student costs are 
estimated to be about S4,887. 

Althougti only one third of the 
700 students have responded so 
far, Roberts predicted a renewed 
concern after midterms. 

"Wc arc working with students 
who arc affected by this. If they 
can'i replace the loan, wc arc 
assisting them in finding other 
resources," added Roberts. 

She noted no students, so far, 
have indicated they could not 
reium because of the Perkins 
loan recall. 







President-elect Bill Clinton and running mate Al Gore are 
popular with many IPFW students.

University experts 
examine '92 races 




By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

This year's campaigns have 
proven hard to pin down and 
define. 

Experts squabble over who has 
run the betier campaign. 

Even political science profes- 
sors disagree on the importance 
of the campaigns. 

"People lend to say those 
ahead ran a good campaign 
white those behind ran a good 
campaign," said Julius 
Smulkstys, assistant professor of 
political science. 

"I'm not sure that running a 
good or bad cam- 
paign is all thai 
important in the 
final analysis. 1 
thmk people make 
decisions based 
more on wheiher 
or not they are 
happy with itic 
currem siiuaiion." 
said Smulkstys. 

While ruruiing a 
good or a bad 
campaign may not be that impor- 
tant, running some campaign is 
criiieal for many candidates, 
according to Michael Downs, 
chair of the political science 
deparimeni. 

"There arc some campaigns 
that don't make any difference at 
all, but this presidential cam- 
paign has been very important 
for Bill Clinton and Ross Perot." 
said Downs. 

"Clinton and Perot were rela- 
tively unknown. It's the cam- 
paign that has made them rela- 
tively acceptable lo large num- 
bers of people," said Downs. 

Since President Bush was 
already well known, the cam- 
paign wasn't as imporiani, 
according to Downs. 

Even though Smulkstys said 
the campaigns weren't that 
important, he said Ihe Republi- 
cans ran liie campaign poorly. 

"It appears lo me the Republi- 
cans ran an mept campaign. In 
the past the candidates always 
address the nation on election 
eve. Both Clinton and Perot 
bought lime on the television 
networks." 

Ross Perot has had a profound 
effect on the race for president. 



according to Downs. 

"We've never had a third party 
candidate who is so charismatic 
and unpredictable," said Downs. 
"President Bush has sufi'ered 
somewhat by having Perot in the 
race. Middle-aged, white males 
are the backbone of the Perot 
movement. These are the people 
who generally vote Republican 
in significantly larger numbers 
than they vote Democrat," said 
Downs. 

Downs and Smulkstys dis- 
agreed on ihe siaie interest levels 
of the national elections. 
"I think this has been one of 
the most colorful 
and interesting 
campaigns I've 
seen," said Downs, 
"Presidential 
races in Indiana 
have been uninicr- 
esiing because the 
Republicans as- 
sume they will win. 
So do the Demo- 
crats, so nobody 
campaigns here. 
"Presidential ly, Indiana is one 
of the least interesting places in 
the nation," said Smulkstys. 

On the state level. Downs said 
the effect of the campaigns was 
evident. 

"The most glaringly unsuc- 
cessful campaign is the Lenly 
Pearson campaign. He ran into a 
lot of [rouble and bad luck. He 
wasn't able to generate that 
much support," said Downs. 

Governor Bayh on the oiher 
hand ran a very well managed 
and professional campaign, 
according to Downs. 

Smulkstys attributes the enthu- 
siasm over Slate races to rcdis- 
triciing. 

"With the stale legislature's 
redistricling. the Democraiic 
candidates became more viable. I 
think this has generated more 
interest in the election at the 
state level," said Smulkstys. 

Also, the Fort Wayne 
Community Schools race has 
prompted voter interest, accord- 
ing to Smulkstys. 

"For a long time the Fort 
Wayne community school board 
was appointed, but in the lasi 
two elections they have been 
elected," Smulkstys said.

Campus reaction was mixed 
Tuesday night as ii became 
clear ihat Arkansas Governor 
Bill Clinton would succeed in 
his bid to become the next pres- 
ident of the United States. 

Studcnis intently watched the 
1992 national and area election 
totals ring in on television at 
several sites around campus 
Tuesday night. 

Larry Paulus. a freshman at 
IPFW. was pleased with (he 
apparent Clinton victory. 

"I'm going to feel comfort- 
able," said Paulus, "With Bush 
in the White House, I've had to 
worry about whether I'll have a 
job tomorrow. I'm going to 
sleep easier now," 

Richard Hess, an IPFW pro- 
fessor who teaches a course in 
political communications, said 
that while this election was a 
significant vote for change, it 
was not a watershed election, 

"A watershed election is an 
election where there is a signifi- 
cant change in voting patterns," 
said Hess, 'This was a rejection 
of Bush's attempts to articulate 
any kind of vision for the 
fuiure." 

Ross Perot's failed bid for the 
presidency may represent a 
more significant electoral 
change than Clinton's landslide 
victory. 

"Perot is the individual who 
really reptesents the decline of 
the political party in the United 
States," said Hess. 

The Peroi factor may have 
been one reason why voter 
turnout was high in Allen 
county. 

Hess attributes this rush to 
participate in the electoral 
process to the apparent national 
recession.

sinking ship to the bitter end.

"I think a lot of people 
bought into the idea that the 
economy needs to be addressed 
in a real way," said Hess. 

Scott Fircslinc, a graduate 
student in library science, saw 
three clear choices heading into 
election day. 

"You could either keep the 
same thing, uy something that 
could possibly be different or 
waste your vote," said Firestine. 

"Bill Clinton was really 
Teflon man," .said Firestine, 



dent and Bush supporter, saw 
the outgoing prcsidcni in a 
more positive light. 

"I think he did as well as he 
could given the situations he 
faced and the democratic con- 
gress, 

"Clinton should have told the 
truth from the start of his prob- 
lems. I really have a problem 
with his draft-dodging. You 
can't be on both sides of the 
coin," said Fin Icy

"The Republican party's scare 
tactics were very unsuccessful." 

Hess sees the Republican tac- 
tics as very normal in the con- 
text of modem politics, he said. 

"Negative campaigns work, 
provided you can back up alle- 
gations not only with conclu- 
sive proof and evidence but 
with statements of your own 
positive aiiribuies." said Hess. 

"1 think twelve years of 
Republican handling of domes- 
tic legislation frankly created

down in history as a very popu- 
lar president," said Hess, "Not 
necessarily a strong president, 
although he was very strong in 
foreign affairs." 

Hess said that while Clinton 
is inexperienced in foreign poli- 
cy, his transition into world 
affairs should be smooth. 

"The United States is still the 
800 pound gorilla. You will be 
received with due respect when 
you are the strongest nation in 
the world both militarily and 
economically," said Hess. 



Election not quite over; 
vote still in 'college' 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

Only 12 of Indiana's voles 
really counted in Tuesday's 
presidential election. And the 
results of these won't even be 
known until January. 

These voles were notched by 
the hoosicr delegation of the 
Electoral College, the group of 
appointed electors who select 
America's commander-in- 
chief. The Elccioral College 
voles are [allied in Wa.shing[on 
on Jan. 6 and are, constilulion- 
ally, ihe final word on the 
selection of the prcsidenL 

Regardless of the apparent 
impotence of the popular bal- 
lot, citizen voting in the gener- 
al election is still important. 
Local, state and national repre- 
sentatives are picked by popu- 
lar vote and the state-wide pop- 
ular vote results are the prima- 
ry factor influencing the 
Electoral College balloting. In 
the end, though, only the 
Electoral College vote is sig- 
nificant in the process. 

Indiana's 12 electors repre- 
sent the number of House and 
Senate members from this 



Slate. California makes up Ihe 
largest portion of the College, 
with 54 electors. Stales with 
slim populations, like Rhode 
Island, have three electors. All 
stales arc guaranteed at least 
three electors. 

Regardless of the margin in 
the popular vote, state electoral 
votes are meted out on a win- 
ner-iake-all basis. Winning 
California's popular vote is 
worth 54 electors whether you 
win by one or 10.000,000 pop- 
ular voles. 

The electors, usually politi- 
cal activists, are selected by 
political parties. They are 
expected to vote along party 
lines. 

But Ihe Electoral College 
doesn't have to select ihe can- 
didate picked by popular vole. 
Three limes in US. history the 
College went against die popu- 
lar vote and selected another 
candidate. The last time this 
happened was in 1888 when 
Republican Benjamin Henry 
Harrison was picked over 
Grover Cleveland - the 
Democraiic candidate who 
look the popular vote.

Athletics should hold own; 
students already poor 



The athletic department 
requested an increase in the 
student service fee and a 
larger share of the profits 
raised. 

Students need to support 
athletics, but they shouldn't 
be unduly charged for the 
enteriainmeni offered. 
Many students neither use 
the facilities themselves 
nor attend school games. 

These students should be 
free of the burden of 
increased fees while losing 
some services they actually 
use. 

With the athletic depart- 
ment requesting a larger 
share of the profitst other 
organizations will undoubt- 
edly suffer from the loss. 

If the athletic department 
needs the money to contin- 
ue functioning, of course it 
should be available. 
However, other methods of 
raising the funds may be 
more fair. 

Charge the people who 
use the facility. The athlet- 
ic center is a superb facili- 
ty. 

Athletics should advertise 
its existence to the commu- 
nity and charge a competi- 
tive fee for non-IPFW 
members. Many other 
health facilities managelo 
fund themselves by selling 
memberships. 

Of course the athletic 
department can't entirely 
fund themselves through 
outside memberships, and 
the students probably 
wouldn't want to wait 
hours for a court. 
However, charging a more 
competitive fee would help. 

In addition to raising rates 
in the community, the 
department should charge 
more for locker rental and 
start charging for equip- 
ment rental. Someone who 
brings his own racket 



shouldn't pay as much as 
someone who puts wear on 
student-purchased rackets. 

Additionally, the games 
held on campus offer an 
invaluable opportunity to 
make some more money. 

The refreshments sold at 
games are a terrific value, 
but maybe too terrific. The 
department should raise 
prices on refreshments. 

If the athletic department 
still needs money and can 
not cut costs, the students 
should fork it over. 

Although many students 
don't use the facilities, 
many do. Most students 
don't use anything that 
doesn't directly relate to 
academics. It doesn't mean 
athletics isn't a worthy 
investment. 

Health and fitness should 
be an important part of 
everyone's life. Students' 
government should encour- 
age use of the facility in 
any way it can. We have 
some terrific athletes, and 
they deserve to have decent 
equipment. 

Many of our athletes are 
the best students on cam- 
pus, there is no excuse to 
push them to other campus- 
es that are more responsive 
to their needs. 

Maybe athletics isn't for 
everyone, but looking at it 
realistically the athletic 
department wants to raise 
the fee by a total of 50 
cents per credit hour. 

Since the maximum num- 
ber of credit hours a stu- 
dent can take, even with 
special permission, is 21, 
the most the fee increase 
will cost anybody is $10.50 
per semester. Maybe 
$10.50 could pay for a cou- 
ple of trips to i\icDonald's, 
but it isn't going to break 
the bank.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 



Homosexual rights 



'Who cares if I'm gay? 



9' 



To the Editor: 

Greg Willson's article in the OcL 
22 issue of The Communicator is 
fairly typical in regards to the argu- 
ments I hear against homosexuality. 
Unfonunaiely. Willson gives what 
may be the three weakest reasons 
for opposing homosexuality. 

The first reason Willson cites is 
what he terms the '"biological 
aspect." He believes thai because 



lows: although there is evidence that 
hormones are related to gender 
nales, there is no concrete proof, "as 
of yet," tiiat sexual preference is 
related to hormonal imbalances. 

I highly doubt that these imbal- 
ances directly influence the standard 
of gender roles. It is much more 
likely that hormones influence sexu- 
al orientation, and that our society 
imposes pressure on someone with ; 



we all don't have a complete set of different preference to act in a cer- 
male and female organs, then to tain manner. Of course this doesn't 



love someone of the same sex is, 
"obviously wrong." 

If Willson is saying that homosex- 
uality is wrong because it is unnat- 
ural, then there is certainly a dis- 
crepancy in his logic. Cars, comput- 
ers, and sunglasses are all unnatural. 
Few of us would argue that these 
things are wrong. 

It's important to remember that 
people who opposed rights for 
women used "natural" laws to 
defend opinions that women were 
put here as a complement to men. 
C'mon, Greg, 1 thought we were 
beyond that. 

Willson's second point is as fol- 



mean that all homosexuals 
stereotypical manner, it just means 
that certain individuals with com- 
mon interests often have common 
mannerisms. This theory makes 
more sense than Willson's. which is 
based on somewhat antiquated and 
misinterpreted information. 

However, hormones may not be 
the single detennining factor con- 
trolling sexual preference. There has 
been research in the past few years 
that suggest psychological influence 
may exist as well. However, most of 
these studies are Just as inconclusive 
as the studies Willson cites. There is 
one point a large number of psy- 



chologists do agree on however: 
homosexuality is not a choice deci- 
sively made by an individual. It is a 
choice that is largely dictated by 
outside factors. 

Willson also uses the Bible as a 
point of reference. While he is enti- 
tled to his religious beliefs, I am 
entitled not to have a religion 
imposed on me. I suggest that if he 
is to write publicly, he avoid citing 
religious texts, simply t&gt;ecause reli- 
gion can not be used as a logical 
proof in a society that allows reli- 
gious freedom. 

1 did not choose to be gay, but I 
am. I don't believe that Greg 
Willson could choose lo be gay. 
even if he wanted lo. The only 
choice I've made is to be truthful 
with myself. Yet I continually am 
attacked and criticized for some- 
thing that I have no control over. I 
love, laugh, bleed, play sports, go 
bike riding, and love my family. 
Who cares if I'm left handed? Who 
cares if I'm gay?

Christian control unconstitutional 



To the Editor: 

I'd like to address all of the peo- 
ple who feel that our leaders arc 
abandoning family values and 
Christian morality. Are you out- 
raged that the Supreme Court feels 
it's okay to bum crosses, yet it's 
not okay to have Christian prayer 
in school. Are you convinced the 
liberals and media are bashing 
Christians every chance they get? 

Well, to all you people. I'd like 
to remind you that you live in 
America, not some right-wing fun- 
damentalist Christian nation, 
(Although that's where we are 
heading.) All Americans, not 
Christians exclusively, are allowed 
the Constitutional freedom to 
practice their religion without per- 
secution. I suggest you all brush 
up on the First Amendment, which 
begins with "Congress shall make 
no law respecting an csublishmcnt 
of religion..." For all you funda- 
mentalists, that means it is NOT 



the duty of our elected officials to 
enforce or endorse Christianity, 
and it is NOT our legislators' duty 
to make laws based on Christian 
beliefs. It is their job, in fact, to 
protect minority groups from the 
tyranny of over-bearing fanatics. 
Their jobs are lo protect the rights 
of ALL Americans, so that they 
can worship, speak, write, assem- 
ble (peaceably), and petition the 
government freely, regardless of 
whether you approve or not. 

If you are one of those people 
who claim to love freedom and 
America, yet get upset because 
you hear something you don't like, 
or because your religion won't get 
endorsed by the Supreme Court, or 
because you arc faced with the 
"offensive" lifestyles, cultures. 
and ideas of others, then I suggest 
you rethink the reasons why you 
love this country. Are you so ego- 
tistical to believe that the 
Constitution was created with only 



you in mind? Is freedom only 
good when it applies to you? 

Meanwhile, if you are so con- 
cerned with spirituality, support 
your church and the people in it. 
If you are concerned with morali- 
ty. I suggest you look at yourself 
first. Are you a racist, a sexist, or 
a homophobic? Are you dogmat- 
ic, intolerable, and selfish to the 
point it harms odiers? Would your 
God be proud of you? tvline 
wouldn't. If you truly arc con- 
cerned about people and family 
values, I suggest you elect a 
democrat who will take responsi- 
bility for helping families by pro- 
viding jobs and health care, 
instead of a republican who helps 
the rich profit by providing cheap 
foreign labor while stripping 
Americans of any human aid. 
Come on Christians, what is the 
moral vote?

Former spy 
believable, 
not traitor 

To the Editor: 

Thirteen years ago, Iranian 
students occupied the U.S. 
embassy in Tehran, taking 
over 50 Americans hostage. 
The images repeatedly 
flashed on TV screens, of 
Iranians burning Uncle Sam 
in effigy and chanting "death 
to America" infuriated me. as 
they probably did most 
Americans. 

Our collective emotional 
turmoil was expressed in var- 
ious ways. At one point dur- 
ing the year-long hostage cri- 
sis. 1 participated, along with 
fellow students, in an "anti- 
Iran" protest at the City- 
County building, replete with 
yellow ribbon armbands and 
a comical effigy of the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah 

Khomeini with an arrow 
through his head. 

My outlook at that time was 
very naive, shaped by the 
provincial tone of my envi- 
ronment and the constrained 
sources of information I con- 
sumed. The impressions I 
had of other countries were 
formed to a significant 
degree by fragmentary sound 
bytes on television news, 
Associated Press reports in 

Letter 

Of The Week 

the morning Joumal-Gazette, 
and the thin gruel served by 
Time, Newsweek, and vari- 
ous other voices of official- 
,dom. 

In this region, at that time it 
was easy to view other coun- 
tries as "enemy others"; out- 
breaks of anti-American sen- 
timent in other countries, so 
far as 1 could tell by the 
provocative, fleeting 

glimpses on the evening 
news, were the expressions 
of brainwashed ideologues 
pitted against my coimtry and 
the freedoms for which it 
stood. 

If the mainstream media had 
provided me a more com- 
plete picture of Iran's history 
in 1979. my attitude toward 
the U.S. embassy occupation 
would have been a bit less 
reactionary: 

Regarding the sidebar to 
The Communicator's article 
on Ex-CIA officer Phillip 
Agee's Oct. 20 visit to our 
campus: Two CIA "insiders" 
cited as sources in this article 
attack Agee's credibility, but 
neither source is named.

THE COMMUNICATOR 



CIA 



continued Trom pg. 2 

How much credibility should we 
grant nameless accusers? And why 
didn't The Communicator include 
their names, or an explanation as to 
why their names were nol listed? 
Did the unnamed insiders mention 
Agcc's open invitation to debate any 
active CIA ofTicer at any of his U.S. 
speaking engagements, and why this 
invitation is consistently declined? 

The report leaves open many dis- 
turbing questions, which 1 hope The 
Communicator Tollows up on, not 
the least of which is why Agec's 
replies to the anonymous allegations 
made against him were not included 
in the article. How come, for Ihal 
matter, if Agcc was working as a 
paid spy for the Cuban and Soviet 
governments - as one of The Com- 
municator's unnamed sources claims 
- he has not been arrested and put 
on trial? Traveling throughout the 
continental United Slates, he is with- 
in easy grasp of any U.S. law 
enforcement agency. 

If Agcc has not been arrested 
because there is not evidence to jus- 
tify his anesl, is it responsible for 
an anonymous "CIA insider" to 
make such allegations against him? 

One method by which The Com- 
municator attempted to solidify a 
case against Agec's character also 
lacks credibility. In what T assume 
was a typo, the reporter claimed that 
her second unnamed source, "a for- 
mer agency personnel member, col- 
laborated CIA reports" (on Agec). 

If the reporter meant thai the 
source "corroborated" the CIA 
reports, it begs the question as to 
how an unidcnlilicd source's claims 
that many in the CIA view Agcc as a 



traitor, and that his allegations are 
nol accurate, "corroborate" agency 
claims that Agec was an unsatisfac- 
tory agent, an alcoholic, a horny 
devil, and a paid spy? 

The red-baiting tactic employed by 
anonymous source number one in 
the article is rather disingenuous, 
considering the record of former 
CIA director and current U.S. presi- 
dent, George Bush, Hundreds of 
Chinese students died in their quest 
for democracy in Tiananmen Square. 
A few weeks after these students 
were gunned down like dogs, during 
a period in which China's hard-line 
leaders were still ferreting out and 
imprisoning the students their bul- 
lets missed, George Bush misled the 
American people by sending his 
National Security Advisor and 
Deputy Secretary of Stale to Beijing 
to conduct covert diplomacy with 
the students' killers. 

The claim by Ihe unnamed sources 
that Agcc is responsible for the 
deaths of several agents is false. 

In 1975, the CIA tried to blame 
Agce's exposure campaign for the 
shooting death of Richard Welch, 
the agency's chief of station in 
Athens, Greece. Welch's cover, 
however, had been blown long 
before Agce began making public 
the names of CIA operatives abroad. 
In 1968, Welch's CIA employ was 
revealed by Julius Mader in his pub- 
lication "Who's Who in Ihe CIA." 
Welch had also been named in a 
Peruvian journal in 1974. In short, 
he had no cover to protect, from 
Agee or anyone else. Congressional 
investigations later revealed that 
when Welch repbced former Athens 
Station Chief Stacy Hulse, he was 
warned by ihc CIA not to move into 
Hulsc's vacated house, which was 



widely known as the CIA Station 

Chief's residence. 

Welch disregarded this advice, at a 
lime when anti-CIA sentiments were 
especially strong in Athens. Agency 
incompetence and Welch's own poor 
judgment made him an easy target, 
not Agec. 

How The Communicator's "insid- 
ers" inlerpreied a number of deaths 
from this mcident is beyond me â€” 
although one may speculate that 
anonymity and a eoncsponding lack 
of accountability for utterances, can 
have a slanderous multiplier elTcct. 

Sunounding the single death which 
the "insiders" falsely blamed on 
Agec is a historical context which 
they convenicndy left oul 

Following World War 11, the U.S. 
and Britain tried to kill off the Greek 
Left, which had been the primary 
freedom fighting movement during 
Greece's Nazi occupation. The CIA 
ihen installed, uained. equipped and 
funded the KYP, a fascist secret 
police force designed lo quel! pro- 
gressive political reforms in Greece. 

In 1967, moderate reformist 
appeared likely to win national elec- 



tions in Greece. Fascist colonels 
subsequenily staged a coup and for 
seven years thereafter, Greece was 
subjected to a military regime, led 
by a KYP colonel who had been its 
chief liaison officer with the CIA. 

Under this ClA-supponed dictator- 
ship, thousands of Greeks were per- 
secuted for their political views 
through imprisonment, torture and 
forced exile 

One particular line in The Commu- 
nicator's article was Orwellian in the 
extreme: "...the CIA is necessary in 
any free society," claimed the 
unidentified formal agency person- 
nel member. 

Considering ihc CIA's overthrows 
of elected governments throughout 
the world, it's boosting of military 
dictatorships in their stead, and its 
role in creating and supporting death 
squads to stifle dissent, I can only 
draw one conclusion from the above 
statemcni. The reason the CIA is 
necessary in free societies is so that 
it can stop them from being free.

Gay bashers ignorant; 
Everyone deserves rights 



To the Editor: 

1 am writing this in regards lo 
ihe editorial written by Mr. Greg 
Willson in the Oci. 22 issue of The 
Communicaior. 

Mr. Willson, I am nol writing 
this letter to gel involved in gay 
rights. But, il is a shame that in 
the limes of crisis that this country 
is going through, all you arc wor- 
ried about is that gays should have 
ihcir righis taken away. 

I believe four things. One: 
Nowhere in the constitution or 
Declaration of Independence did I 
sec that anyone was excluded from 
[heir rights. Oh, wait a minute, 
here it is: All men arc created 
equal, c:(ccpt for homosexuals. 
I'm sorry I overlooked that one. 
Two: 1 finnly l)elieve that you do 
not wake up in the morning and 
say, "I think that I am going to be 



gay today." Being gay happens to 
you when you first take a breath of 
air outside your mother's womb. 
Il is not the person's fault for being 
gay so do not blame them. Recent 
scientific research confirms this. 
Three: You would never know 
95% of the homosexuals you ever 
will sec. Four: What would hap- 
pen if your best friend, or brother 
or sister would tell you that he/she 
is gay? I Just bet that you would 
exclude him from your life right 
away, wouldn't you? 

I will close with something for 
you lo think abouL I think that we 
should take the rights away from 
all ihe ignorant people in this 
world. Do you agree, Mr. Will- 
son? I guess you wouldn't, 
because then you would have no 
righis.

The Heart of the Matter 

"Best Kept Secret" 
by: Steve Bromberek, Cathutic Campus Minister 

One of the better kept secrets this semester has been 
the "Meditation/Prayer Group", sponsored by Campus 
Ministry. The groups meets every Thursday at 5: 1 5 p.m. 
in the Campus Ministry Office. 

The second best kept secret al IPFW is the actual 
location of the Campus Ministry office which, by the 
way. is not located on the third level of the new park- 
ing garage, but on the third level of Helmke Library, 
362,(481-6994). 

Attendance thus far has been scarce. By scarce I 
mean you could shoot a cannon in the room, and m 
one would qualify for the television show Rescue 
911. I'm beginning to take literally what Christ said in 
the gospel, "Where two are gathered in my name, 1 am 
present"! 

The purpose of this group is not to be a Bible study 
group, a devotional group, or a group with any slanted 
political intent. The group is focused upon a series of 
meditation exercises - blending psychology, spiritual 
therapy and practices of both Eastern and Western 
tradition. 

This is not a religious discussion group, but instead a 
group dedicated to both understanding and practicing 
the "best kept secrets" of the ancient practice of 
meditation. 

In Ihe remaining weeks of this semester, the group 
will cover: 

â–² Healing Hurtful Memories 

A Seeine Life in Perspective 

A A wareness of Persons 

A The Riches of Silence 

A Release from Resentmenfs 

A Healine the Past 

Il is our hope that this group will offer a brief refuge 
for students, faculty, and staff and allow them to 
increase their aw areness of themselves and lif e's chal- 
lenges. I Courtesy Campus Ministry |

Confused and cannibalistic? Take this test 




By Tim Schreiber 
Leisure Hack 

Well. 1 found oui about myself 
today. I took the Kcirscy Tempcra- 
mcni Test in my Speech class. It 
consisted of 70 ques- 
tions with 2 multiple 
choice answers each. 
Each one was basical- 
ly a variant of the 
question, are you a 
free spirited, irrespon- 
sible, chance-taking, 
emotional artistic type 
or an anal-rctcniive, 
inith-sccking, goal ori- 
ented, logical business 
person type? 

From those 70 
questions I was 
stamped an Introvert- 
ed Intuitive Feeling Judgmental 
Guy, Thank God. I was worried 
that I'd find out something horrible 
about myself, like I'm really a 
woman trapped in a man's body or I 
subconsciously like Gcraldo. Or 
what if I had found out that I was a 
vegetarian all this lime? And to 
think of all the llcsh I've caicn. 

But no, I'm pretty tame. 

Even so, 1 am still wary of tests 
like that. I don't trust ihem. 

I don't believe you can qualify a 
human personality with a multiple 
choice test. It's like trying to mm 
the Mona Lisa into a paini-by-num- 
bers coloring book. It's a crude imi- 
tation at besL 

Another complaint I have with 
multiple choice tests that think 
they're so smart is that they don't 
provide any way to identify deceit- 
ful psychotic pederastic cannibalis- 
tic serial killers. To mc, that would 
be an important thing to know about 
a person. 

You would think that any tem- 
perament test diat's worth the paper 
it's printed on would ask something 
like, "How many children have you 
killed and eaten in the last year?" I 
know that's high priority on my list 
when I meet someo)T'((__^, [^ ^! /\ 

â€¢ Sc^lo fill a void left by these so- 
called "scientific" personality tests. 
I have made up my own personality 
test. Not only will it tell you what 
perverted and demented thoughts lie 
deep within your subconscious, but 
it will also answer the high priority 
question. "Are you normal, neurot- 
ic, or psychotic?" 
Tim's Personality Test 
I. When you approach a yellow 
light, do you 



a) speed up 

b) slow down 

c) shout profani 



It the nearest 



d) gun down the nearest dnvcr

not answer all the questions. This 
indicates thai you have trouble fin- 
ishing things. It's probably the 
result of some unresolved childhood 
trauma. Get help. 

14-28 points: You are normal, 
which means you lied on the test. 
This is probably the result of some 
unresolved childhood trauma. Get 
help. 

29-42 points: You are neurotic. 
This may be the result of some 
childhood trauma, or it could be 
something much deeper than that, 
like your brain is infested with tiny 
gremlins who screw around with 
your subconscious. The gremlins 
were probably emotionally scarred 
as children. Ask them to get help. 

43-56 points: You are psychotic. 
You are probably having a delusion- 
al psychotic episode right now, and 
this test is a figment of your imagi- 
nation.

points: You don't scientifically 
exist. I am probably having a delu- 
sional psychotic episode, and you 
are a figment of my imagination.

Reggae release 



Bob Marley jams on new box set 



By J. William Richardson

The hisiory of Jamaica's reggae

era. 

Bob Marlcy's music has been 
marketed in "Greatest Hits" form 
before, but "Songs of Freedom," a 
4-CD numbered Island release, 
priced at S39.99, Is the most com- 
prehensive and musically pleasing 
product in the bunch. 

"Songs of Freedom" (overall rat- 
ing: 4.8 out of five) contains 78 
songs and over five hours of music. 
If you consider yourself a fan of 
Marlcy's music this is definitely 
the set for you. 

Perhaps the greatest asset of the 
set is its calchy packaging. 
Distributed in a slick, book format, 
"Freedom" can easily be carried 
around or stored on a bookshelf, 
unlike many other box sets. 

In the center of the four discs is a 
64 page book detailing Marley's 
career from the recording of "Judge 
Not" in Kingston in 1962 to ihc 
attempt on his life in 1976 to his 
death from cancer at age 36, in 
1981. 

The book takes a look at Marley 
from many angles, and essays from 
his wife, Rita, and many of his fel- 
low musicians give insights into 
the origins of his music and the 
foundations of his spiiiL 

The book talks about Jah, ihe 
drcadlocked Rasiafarians and their 
influence on Marley's reggae. Ii 
also explains the circumstances and 
meanings of many of ihc songs 




Marley's "Songs of Freedom" 
available in stores now. 



included in (he set. 

More important than ihe book is 
the music. The four discs, while 
not including the entire catalog of 
music, carry the bulk of his most 
definitive works. 

AJong widi Bob Marley and the 
Wallers standards are many previ- 
ously unreleased tracks found in 
Riia's music vault. The most 
notable previously unreleased 
tracks are "No Woman No Cry 
(Live at ihe Roxy)," and an 
acoustic medley recorded in Bob's 
bedroom in Stockholm in 1971 fea- 
turing the tunes "Guava Jelly," 
"This Train," and "Siir it Up" 
among others. 

Notably missing from the compi- 
lation is "Buffalo Soldier," a 
posthumous hit for Marley. 

The final song on the second disc, 
"I Shot the Sheriff (Live)," record- 
ed live in London, was covered by 



Eric Clapton and hit number one 
on the American pop charts in 
1974. Marley's version here is a 
very clean recording from the 
"Wailer" era and is an interesting 
contrast to the Clapton effon. 

The most moving Hack is 
undoubtedly the final one on the 
final disc and, unfortunately, the 
one with the worst recording quali- 
ty on ihe set. "Redemption Song 
(Live in Pittsburgh)" was recorded 
at Marley's final concert appear- 
ance, when he was already in ihe 
grip of terminal cancer. 

The digital remastering of the set 
has cleaned up the sound of ihe 
songs, with a few exceptions on 
disc one. lo a remarkable extent, 
especially when you consider the 
technology of the times al die Tuff 
Gong studios m Jamaica. 

I personally am glad I purchased 
the SCI, I am a fan of reggae and 
more specifically of Bob Marley 
and the Wailers, but in the end, the 
decision is yours. Bob Marley fans 
and fanatics and those seeking a 
nearly complete, exhaustive, high 
recording quality reggae box set 
should definitely lay down Iheir 40 
bucks and take one home. 

If you don't have a good idea of 
what reggae is or how you feel 
about it, 1 recommend that you pur- 
chase "Legend," (rating: 4.3 out of 
five) Island's other major Marley 
greatest hit release. Legend con- 
tains the most significant tracks 
found on "Songs of Freedom" 
(plus "Buffalo Soldier") and the 
single disc carries a reasonable 
price locally of S16.99,

He attended Notre Dame for his

Mastodon basketball faces suspensions 



By Joe Hwrsche 
Sports Editor 

Senior men's basketball siandoui. 
Scan Gibson, was temporarily 
declared ineligible lo play in the 
upcoming season due lo an NCAA 
rules violalion, 

Gibson violated an NCAA rule 
stating players who participate in 
outside basketball competition over 
the summer must have written 
approval from the athletic depart- 
ment and the event must be sanc- 
tioned by the NCAA. 

Gibson and two other rPPW play- 
ers â–  Shane Gibson and Pat Murphy - 
participated in the Woodbum Days 
basketball tourney last June. Shane 
Gibson and Murphy were also 
declared ineligible. 

But after several hearings on the 
rules violation, IPPV recommended 
the players be suspended for one 
game each and the NCAA accepted 
the recommendations. The players 
will serve their suspensions in three 
separate games. 

Scan Gibson will sit out the 
Mastodon's exhibition game against 
the Cook Industries AAU team on 
Oct 20, Shane Gibson will miss die 
first regular season game on Nov. 24 
against Sl Francis and Murphy will 
sit when IPFW faces Hillsdale 
College on Dec. 1. 

The initial investigation by IPFW 
Compliance Coordinator David 
Fairchild and Assistant Athletic 
Director Dan Gebhart, suggested a 
violation occurcd. 

Fairchild suggested a formal hear- 
ing headed by Faculty Athletic 
Representative Professor Robert A. 
Barrett be held to determine the 
cxtwt of the violations. 

The panel verified Fairehild's pre- 
liminary findings and labeled the 
infraction a secondary violation. 

The secondary violaUon required 
the players be immediately declared 
ineligible. 

DPFW then filed its full report wiUi 
â– the NCAA along with its recommen- 
dations for penalties.

team ended the regular season 
schedule with two wins in a trip 
10 Alaska over the weekend.

the University of Alaska at 
Fairbanks and The University of 
Alaska at Anchorage with deci- 
sive victories in three games for

momentum of these two victo- 
ries and a 8-0 record in the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference play in 
the GLVC tournament to be held 
on the IPFW campus in the 
Milliard Gates Sport Center. 

The tournament will be held on 
Saturday, Nov. 14 and Sunday, 
Nov, 15 at the Lady "Dons home 
coua

IPFW with the wins they need to 
gain a bid to the NCAA Final 
Four tournament.
