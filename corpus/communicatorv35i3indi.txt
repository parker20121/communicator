The inaugural Days of

days of peace, prayer and non-

day of prayer and spiritual 
awakening on Thursday, Sept. 
9. Thursday's service was led 
by Reverend Gregory Guice at 
the Unity Christ Church. Its 
purpose was to convey a mes- 
sage of peace through a bring-

Yearlong party

with dedication 
of new statue

The Communicator 



Clowns, jugglers, live 
music, free food and the dedi- 
cation of a 3,500 pound bronze 
mastodon shows that IPFW 
knows how to throw a party. 

Approximately 1,200 
IPFW students, faculty and 
staff packed into the plaza in 
front of Walb Student Union 
Tuesday night to celebrate the 
university's 40th birthday. 

The festivities were 
kicked off by live music per- 
formances by the winners of 
the local American Idol contest, 
and the band Spike &amp; the 
Bulldogs. 

But the spotlight of the 
night was clearly on the univer- 
sity's massive mastodon statue, 
which was lifted by crane and 
set on campus Monday.

parly. 

He spoke at the celebra- 
tion accepting the Mastodon 
statue. The statue was donated 
by Star Financial Bank and 
dedicated to future IPFW fami- 
ly and friends. 

"White you may not real- 
ize it, having a symbol like this 
on campus is an important step 
in the development of IPFW, 
the development of our athletic 
program, and in the develop- 
ment of the community," he 

The dedication of the statue 
was concluded with IPFW's

school fight song.

would be a helpful addition to 
the campus. 

"Hopefully the new

IPFW has accomplished 
so much in 40 years. From the 
beginning, we've played a 
major role in the life of this

life, and at the same lime, we've 
provided an excellent education 
to residents of northeast Indiana

earned degrees with us. 

Having come this far, 
IPFW has much to look forward 
to. This year, the university 
opens student housing, adding a 
new dimension to student life 
on campus. More construction

The Teach-in on peace 
and non-violence sought to 
bridge the gap and strengthen 
understanding about history, 
ideologies and positive effects 
of non-violent action, and how 
they can affect the world. The 
events on Friday were broken 
up into 30 minute blocks. They 
started with poems about peace 
and non-violence. Poems from 
famous writers were included, 
such as parts from "The 
Tempest," by William 
Shakespeare. 

Along with Johnson, 
speakers included Karen and 
Bruce Jaquish. Craig Nix and 
other various other presenters. 
Then Emily Osbun Bemes fol- 
lowed with a visualization ses- 
sion aimed at getting in touch 
with your self and finding inner 
peace. The rest of the Teach-in 
displayed various speakers and 
videos infused with peace, war 
and possible solutions and 
alternatives to war. 

Pat Ashton, Professor of 
Sociology at IPFW, also spoke 
out for peace and non-violence. 
Ashton dispelled preconceived 
notions the Days of Agreement 
was a partisan movement. 

"This is a non-partisan 
issue. It questions national poli- 
cies of not only our own gov- 
ernment, but alt governments 
concerning the various forms of 
violence," he commenled. In

part of human nature. The issue 
is how we deal with those dif-

made a point to say this search 
for peace is not a radical and 
unrealistic idea that would sug- 
gest violent people will just dis-

Suicide: Recognize the warning signs 



Did you know..,? 
•This year, approximately 
1,100 college students will die 

•Suicide is the second 
leading cause or death among 
college-age students and more 
teenagers die from suicide than 
from all medical illnesses com- 

•Five million living 
Americans have attempted to 
kill themselves, with 765.000 
Americans attempting suicide 



■Suicide kills 

nian&gt; people as homicide could include 

•There are more than four 
male suicides for every female 



untreated or undcrtreatcd. 
Depression is treatable. Studies 
indicate (hat the best way to 
prevent suicide is through the 
early recognition and treatment 
of depression and other psychi- 
atric illnesses. 

Many are not aware that 
people who are suicidal often 
exhibit warning signs. In fact, 
four out of five young adults 
who attempt suicide have given 
clear warnings. Here are the 
more typical warning signs: 

•Talking about suicide or 
dying, and make 









sinudc However, e 

as many females as males 

attempt suicide. 

Sept. 5 through 1 1 was 
National Suicide Prevention 
Week and as representatives of 
both the Allen County und the 
State suicide prevention coali- 
tions, we wish to lake this 
opportunity to raise awareness 
about the pervasiveness and 
preventable nature of suicide 
and whal you, the average citi- 
zen, can do to prevent suicide. 

Suicide is a public health 
problem that is preventable. 
Most people who die by suicide 
do not want to die, rather they 
want to relieve the pain, or 
"psychache," that ihcy are 
experiencing but feel hopeless 



'T. very one would be 
without me " 

•Being preoccupied with 
death and dying, including writ- 
ing poems, stories or letters that 
talk about death; 

•Sleeping or eating too 
much or too little; 

•Giving away personal 
belongings or making final 
arrangements like a will; 

•Withdrawing from

•Expressing rage, uncon- 
trolled anger, seeking revenge; 

•Having an acute crisis 
(see below). 

These warning signs may 
not be enough to cause a suicide 
attempt but raise the risk signif- 
icantly. There are often other 
precipitating events or crises 
that cause a person to act on 
their suicidal thoughts. These 
precipitating evcnls could 
include: getting in trouble at 
school, work or with the law; 
the threat of legal action; threat 
of or actual loss of a job or 
financial assets; relationship 
problems; fighting with parents 
or other family or friends; the 
loss of a loved one through 
death; and/or significant 
changes in family situations, 
such as divorce; or emotional, 
physical or sexual abuse. 
Remember that what does not 
appear lo be a significant or dis- 
turbing situation for an older 
person, may be for a younger 
person. Younger people may 
also show their depression in 
different ways than adults so 
look for changes in normal 
mood, activities or behavior. 

Whal can you do? 

•ir you suspect some- 
one you know is depressed and 
suicidal or could be suicidal, 
approach that person. 

•Talk openly about 
depression and suicide and ask 
directly about whether the per-

•Listen and affirm their 
feelings. Do not judge or debate

Anti-Catholic 
column in bad 
taste, insulting 



Dear Editor, 

I feel that it is necessary 
for me to respond to Tim 
Rodgers for his column in the 
last issue of the Communicator 
(Our Lady of Perpetual 
Motion, Sept. 1, 2004) I have 
re-read the article numerous 
times and still am not sure of 
the point which he was trying 

It is obvious that he was 
mpting to be humorous 



let 






obvious concern with the 
stereotype of nuns. Since I 
have never taught in a class- 
room setting, the image por- 
trayed of Sisters doesn't per- 
sonally affect me. 

It does, however, offend 
me because of all of the Sisters 
that I do know who have dedi- 
cated their life to teaching chil- 

I do not deny that the 
stereotype he described has 
some basis in the truth. 
However, what seems lo be 
quickly forgotten is that, as 
recently as the 1950s, corporal 
punishment was practiced in 
public as well as private 
schools. 

1 will admit that the prac- 
tice was a little slower to end in 
the Catholic schools. Even so. 
the practice of corporal punish- 
ment ended in the Catholic 
schools by the 1980s. While it 
is possible there have been iso- 
lated instances since then, it is 
certainly nol the norm nor is it 
condoned by any authority 
within the Catholic Church. 

I welcome anyone who 
wants to know what a Sister is 
really like (o slop by my office 
in Walb 235. 

My second - and really 
more major - concern with Ihe 
column was that it appeared to 
be making fun of the atrocity 



Child molestation 



authority. I am deeply sad- 
dened by the abuse scandal in 
the Catholic Church, as is 
every single Sister that I know, 
or, for that matter, every single 
Catholic I know. To refer to an 
attempted molestation as a 
"game of Marco Polo" is sim- 
ply unconscionable. 

Statistics would say that, 
on this campus, there are prob- 
ably over a thousand victims of 
child abuse or molestation 
from parents, teachers, rela- 
tives, coaches, friends, 
strangers or, sadly, clergy. 

No such victim (hat I 
have ever known would find 
Rodgers' comments humorous. 
Saying that blind priests would 
lower the number of molesta- 
tion cases, again, massively 
paints a large group of inno- 
cent people guilty of Ihe crimes 
of the rew. 

The vast majority of 
priests have never been 
involved in this crime and con- 
tinue to quietly and steadfastly 
serve the people of God. 

His column also appears 
to me to be ridiculing anyone 
with a physical disability. I 
don't think that students who 
use a wheelchair would find 
humor in the image of speed 
bumps in the classroom. 

Lastly, his descriptive 

society" is disconcerting. 

Maybe he could spend a 
couple of hours volunteering at 
the various homeless shelters 
in town and actually talk to the 
people there. He might realize 
the amount of truth in the old 
adage: "There but for the grace 
of God go I." 

I suspect that his reaction 
to this letter may be that I 
should get a sense of humor. 
Actually, 1 have a very good 
sense of humor and can readily 
laugh at myself and my church 
in its human foibles. "Sister 
Act" and "Nunsense" are

Mastodon pelts taken 
away by Central Mich, 
in third loss of season 



Chippewas dropped the IPFW 
Lad\ Mastodons to a 1-3 record 
on Sept. 10 at Hefner Field. 

"Il was a massacre," said 
IPFW Assistant Coach Mike 
Harper, as the Chippewas 
proved to be just loo lough on 
offense, scoring two goals in 



Midwest Athletic Conference 
school, the Lady Maslodons 
struggled to compete in the 
speed category, routinely being 
bealen to ihe ball by the 
Chippewas. 

"They were much faster - 
the speed killed us. They were 
all over the place," admitted 

indeed, the game was 
almost completely played on 
the IPFW half of Ihe field, test- 



ing and pressuring the defense 
for almosl a full 90 minutes. 
The lack of speed hindered Ihe 
Mastodons on offense, rarely 
able to attack ihe Chippewas 
and put shots on the goal. 

Already four games into 
the season, the Lady Mastodons 
look to have their hands full. In 
addition to the lack of speed on 
the front line, the coaching staff 
again switched goalies at half, 
wilh Shannon Lynn replacing 
Timeka Bailey. 

"We've been splitting 
(lime) until one of them takes 
charge," Harper acknowledged. 

A move lhat could poten- 
tially become a quick problem 
without a solid anchor on the 
back line. 

However, Harper was 
quick to note that all hope is not 
lost 

They just need io gel that 
winning fight back in them. 
They had it at ihe beginning of 
ihe year and they've losi it." 

With upcoming games 
against Murray State at home 
Sept. 19. and a road game at 
Indiana State two days later, 
Harper sees a definite chance 
for the Maslodons lo turn their 
fortune around. 

"Those are potenlial wins 
and we need to get them."
