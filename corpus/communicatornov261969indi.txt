Guest Editorial 



Edilor'i Note: The }oltowine poU iuoj suhmiUed to us by an un- 
known student. We feel that it is ol interest to our readers. 

I asked several atudenta about their ideas of the paid 
parking idea. Here are the results. 

Will you pay the ?50 or $60 that the school is asking 
for parking your car in the parking lot? 

"No! Students already have had to pay an increase in 
the academic fees and the activity fees. The increase has 
not seemed to affect anything — we still have limited activi- 
ties, even though I realize some of the increase is going 
toward the new addition. I think the students are paying 
out more than for what they are receiving, The State has 
shafted us on the increase. We (Students) are giving about 
97.4';^ and the State - 2.6% of the cost. Why should we give 
up S50 or ?60 more for something we already have free? 
How can we benefit? How about a red carpet from our cars 
to the school?" 

"No. I don't have it. I'm just lucky to be in school 
next semester." 

"Yea, School is so important to me that I would pay, 
but I'd rather not pay at all." 

If the cost was lowered would you pay? 
"No. I'll park on the side of the road before I pay 
any more. Anyway, parking in the parking lot is like parlnng 
in a gravd pit. If we have to pay $50 to 560 how about 
having someone to park the car when we arrive and bringing 
the car to the door when we are ready to go home? And if 
that is done how about having the car washed and cleaned 
out every day, too? If that is too ridiculous — why aren't 
the facilities improved then?" 

Even if teachers have to pay, I think they should not 
be allowed to park at the front of the lot. The students 
should be first — we are the ones paying to study and learn. 
Teachers may be able to get to class on time, but if the 
students don't. Who does it benefit? 
"No, Unless dovni to ?3 or lower." 
"I'd like it lowered — I'd like to see none." 
Do you think others share your ideas? 
"Yes, I am sure they do. The petition has been accepted 
by most of the students here. Those who have not signed 
are so apathetic that they don't care or they just won't 
be around for next semester." 

"Yes. I know many people who do," 
"Yea. The petitions prove that our ideas are basically 
the same." 

What do you feel about it? 

"The new administration seems to want to cut down on 
the rising student enrollment. They seem to have the policy 
that if students can't pay — they shouldn't go to school." 

"The school is State supported and it is supposed to be 
free. If we have to pay for parking, the school becomes a 
selective institution for the rich." 

Students on the main campus' have to pay a high 
parking fee. They have to pay the high parking fee. Do you 
think you are any different than they are? 

'The reason we are at the extension is because we 
cannot afford to go to the main campus. All of the students 
here commute — we have to. There are no dormitories or 
any other facilities for living on campus. The students on 
the main campus do not need cars as much as we do. The 
campus is situated so that students can move from apart- 
ments and dormitories easily." 

"No, but I don't live on campus — if I could live on 
campus with a car Td pay, but otherwise no." 

"We, are the regional campus which is very small. The 
main campus is larger. They have the facilities for more 
parking. We do not have the facilities. If we had facilities — 
we should pay." Thank you, students. 




Above, sludenls sign the yellow petitions circulated by Alpha 
Epsilon Kappo frolernity which reod, "We, the undersigned mem- 
bers of the university community at Iha indiono-Purdue Fort Wayne 
Campus, ore opposed to any form of poid porking at the Indiana- 
Purdue Fort Wayne Campus," According to President Steve Petly- 
[ohn, neofly 1500 signatures hove been gothered wilhin a 24-hour

Student Government 
Comment 

by Mark Souder, Student Body President 

The hottest issue on campus today is paid parking. 
What may be a mere rumor has started to spread throughout 
campus. The rumor possibly started at the Leadership Re- 
treat last September when the Deans said it was a possibility. 
It might have started at a Senate meeting in October when 
the then Dean Smith said, "It's coming." It may have begun 
circulating when sources reported that the Vice-Presidents 
at the main campuses were considering it. 

The rumor, briefly stated is this — In order for a student 
to have the same excellent parking space he has now ^vill 
cost him §60.00 a year,' He could park in the gravel lot for 
a mere ?50.00. There may be free parking a great distance 
from the campus. 

Several reasons which supposedly explain why — are 
these: 1) Building A will be placed in the present lot causing 
a shortage of spaces. Paid parking will cover the cost for 
building new spaces. 2) High-rise parking lots will be needed 
in the future. In order to build there, operating expenses 
will be used. Paid parking will be needed to cover operating 
expenses. These are but two often quoted "reasons." 

You may ask, what do we knowl Actually, very little 
is known, A joint student-faculty-administration committee 
has been formed to consider , paid parking. On paper, it 
looks great. What we are concerned about is preventing this 
conmiittee from becoming a mere forum for dissemination 
of information. 

The administration seems to feel it's necessary. In 
entering the discussions, open-minded students will be at 
a decided disadvantage. We need to enter these discussions 
with the backing, the strong-backing, of the student body. 

At this time we can only assume that the administration 
is discu-ssing this issue in good faith. We assume that the 
decision has not been made and that the people who would 
have to pay for parking will have a substantial voice in 
whether or not they have it. 

I for one, still oppose "taxation without representation." 



A Conservative Estimate 



by Don Stuckey 

1 am concerned over the liber- 
ties our female population has 
been taking over the past fifty 
years. Possibly, it's my rural up- 
bringing. Possibly, it's my tra- 
ditional outlook. Possibly, it's my 
fundamentalist background. What- 
ever the reason, I'm alarmed. 

First it was political equality. 
As if Uiat weren't bad enough, 
they began e crusade to get equal 
employment opportunities. This is 
dLipicabIc, Before you knoiv it, 
they tvill consider themselves on 
a level equal ivith men. 

Women, I ask you to remember 
your position. You are not sup- 
posed to be out picketing for the 
latest reform measure. You're not 
supposed to be givins orders to 



your superiors, (whether husbi 
or father). You are in a posit 
subordinate to your husband 
father. You do as they order. Your 
main duties are to bear children 
and to take care of the home. 

For diosc of you that believe 
in the Bible, I offer you certain 
choice verses from Timothy, Chap- 

idest apparel, with 
■s and sobriety; n 
with braided hair, or gold, &lt; 
pearls, or costly array; But wi 
good works. But I suffer not 
woman to teach, not to usurp 
authority over the man, bu 
be in SILENCE." 

To Mr. John Ainloy: I thank 
you for your sound advice on this 
matter, I'm happy that you agree 






Letters 
to the editor 



LETTER TO EDITOR: 

Recendy the Student Mental 
Health Association presented a 
I here at the Regional Campus, 
s documentary concerned the 
itment given the criminally in- 
e of a certain state in the 
United States, Everyone 1 talketl 
o afterward agreed tvith me that 
t was an excellent movie and 
iliould not have been missed by 
any student who has compassion 
r another human being. 
However, this is rot the point 
of the letter. My complaint is the 
following. A few minutes before 
movie begain, a gentleman 
from the Mental Health Depart- 
ment addressed a roomful of stu- 
dents and asked if as many as 
possible would sit on the floor as 
ibers of the outside commun- 
ity had called to make reservations 
see the film. Yes, that's what 
^id — sit on the floor so the 
outside community could see the 
ovie as they had reservations! 
My question is why were citi- 



\ who 






nected with nor provide any direct 
support to the university given 
preferrential treatment over stu- 
dents who must pay part of the 
cost of maintaining the school 
out of their oivn pockets? Why 
were students not abo allowed to 
make reservations? Why didn't 
tlie outside community hove to 
pay to sec this movie as happens 
with the film series? The students 
paid, through their tuition and 
activity fee, 

I believe that if this documen- 
tary was intended for members of 
tlie general community as well as 
the studenU of the Regional Cam- 
pus then there should have been 
a special showing for these "out- 
siders" that ivould not have in- 
terfered with our rights to see 
llie film. 

Before anyone gets the wrong 
idea and feels that ! am launching 
a personal tirade against the Men- 
tal Health Association, allay your 
feors. My wish is not to cast a 
bud hght on this organization, I 
am simply using this incident as a 
recent example which focuses very 
well on the broader problem. 

Ever since the Regional Cam- 
pus has been built, the rights of 
students to use the physical facili- 
ties, meeting rooms being the 
prime example, have been subor- 
dinated to the wiEhcs of the gen- 
eral community, I know of many 
students who have tried to reserve 
a meeting room and who have 
been turned down because man- 
agement in industry or some other 
such group already had it re- 
served. As a little sidelight, this 
not caring about the students is 
especially prevalent in the area 
of scheduling. Many of the upper- 
classmen who are taking required 
courses find their classes sche- 
duled at night tor the convenience 
itrial workers of the 



of the 



Students are paying more mo- 
ney than they should have to in 
order to get an education and also 
to keep the university operating. 
I feel that their wishes and rights 
to use and enjoy the facilities we 
have here should come first. I 
am hoping this will be so in the 
future, 

— Tom Heauing

Taking advantage of Indiana-

"We got our first taste of var-

taking a 128-85 setback.

so we forced him outside the se-

Team Bus Takes To Ditch

Traveling to Spring Arbor for 
their first varsity game, Indiana- 
Purdue got unexpected troubles. 
The basketball players were ready 
for a lough game, but did not 
expect such bizzare pre-game ac- 

The ABC Coach they were tra- 
veling in, missed a paved exit 
while turning around and sunk 
its rear wheels deep 
soaked birm. With the 
end blocking the west 
of Hi-way 60, the bus 
evacuated by the players. 

With no emergency flares or re- 
flectors put out by the driver, 
either because be didn't have any 
or because he didn't think they 
were necessary, a sticky situation 
existed for nearly fifteen minutes. 

During a few heort dirobbing 
moments, a ivcst bound semi load- 
ed doivn with farm fencing nar- 
rowly escaped a disaster. Not ex- 
pecting the hi-wny lo he blocked, 
the semi driver pulled tlie air 
;d past in t!ic 
bound lane. Luck- 
as in the lane at 



fer a helping band.

&lt;f the 



Concordia Senior in the opener. 
The second game at 8:45 p.m. 
pits Indiana Tech against St. 
Francis. Saturday night at 8:45. 
the previous nights' winners will 
clash for No. 1 supremecy of City 
colleges. 

Concordia Senior vrill put its 
four consecutive victory string on 
the line, with Indiana - Purdue 
hungry to snap it, Concordia's 
strength must survive the loss of 
last year's lop seven players. 
Coach Curly Haas's Saxons lost 
hvo year starters in Ron Rail, 
John Neuberger, Jim Martin, and 
Dave Martin. Tlie only returnees 
are Bob Schrocder, who started 
half a season as guard, and jun- 
ior varsity players Richard Noack 
and Dave Knuck. 

Height ivill he no problem, how- 
ever. He picked up Paul Teyer, 
Ken Gerihe and Bruce Harmon, 
all 6-5. 

Haas staled, "We've lost last 
years outside shooting, but this 
teams height should give us the 
rebounding edge for extra shots." 

The optimism of the Saxson's 
coach proved out their first game 
as they won 79-68 behind Alan 
Janneke's 26 point salvo. 

Indiana Tech playing ils first 
game of the season against St. 
Francis tbat evening, could be in 
tor a long year. Graduation took 
tlie second-highest scorer in school 
history, Jim Whitt, who had o 
four year career of 1,933 points. 

Lacking the big men, coach Boh 



Macey will probably start Sieve 
Henson 6-2 and Rick Wells 6-3. 
Getting the center position will 
probably be freshmen. Rick Clen- 
denon at 6-3. The backcourt will 
probably have starling assign- 
menls for Ben Shaffer, Pat Ma- 
lone, or Terry Tegtmeier. The 
guards only had ofC-and-on starts 
last year and will be lacking the 
experience. 

St. Francis, in going against 
Indiana Tech, should be fairly 
well matched ivith them. St. Fran- 
cis' worries begin witli gradua- 
tion. Lost from last year are 
6-5 Bob Herber. Gail Scarbrough, 
and Terry Thompson, Herber av- 
eraged 10 rebounds per game in a 
fifty game career and clicked for 
an 18 point average those same 
games, "That's a lot to replace. 
We've gol no one lo replace him," 
said coach Terry Coonan, 

The job cut out for Coonan is 
lo build around his seven relum- 
ing Icltermen, Tom Christe, Dave 
McClure, and John O'Connor, are 
the two year men among them. 
This structure ivill rely heavily on 
Bruce Logan, a 6-5, 238-pounder, 
Hoiv goes Logan is how the team,

Symbol Told 




The Nuclear Disarmament Sym- 
bol was designed on February 21, 
1958, and was adopted immediate- 
ly by Hugh Brock and Pat Arrow- 
smith on behalf of the District 
Action Committee Against Nu- 
clear War (London! who initiated 
and organized the first Aldermas- 
ton March at Easter that year. 

The Symbol, tlic composite ba- 
sic form of a semaphore signal 
for the letters N and D, was one 
small contribution to the March. 
The meaning, in its original de- 
sign context as an essential unit 
of the visual witness of the March, 
was more than "Nuclear Disarm- 
First thoughts on the need for 
a symbol {on 2/19/58) flowed 
from the obvious practical diffi- 
culty of making a large number 
of long banners with the words 
"Nuclear Disarmament" — words 
which are too long for the ma- 
jority of people to read or imder- 
sland. The first mark on paper 
was a white circle against a black 
square. This was followed by 

crosses drawn ivithin the while 
"sphere" on a black background 
and these in turn gave way to the 
final ND fgrm. 

From the moment the validity 
of the Symbol as a gesture of 




human despair became clear; the 
central motif — a human being in 
despair; a circle — the world; the 
background — eternity. This was 
the meaning of the ND sign car- 
ried on the Aldersmaston march. 

Immediately following the 
"First Morch" {there has been 
previous small scale Aldermaston 
demonstrations) an ND badge 
version of the Symbol was de- 
viled and made by Eric Austen. 
Eric's researches into the origins 
of symbolism confirmed that the 
"gesture of despair" motif has 
been associated through ancient 
history ivith the "death of man," 
and the circle with "the unhom 
child." The significance of the tivo 
motifs combined is the predica- 
ment in which, by chance, we 
live. 

Thus our peace symbol origi- 
nated and is still in common use 
today — especially ivitb the Viet- 
nam moratoriums that have so 
recently o ecu red. 



Thoughts On Thanksgiving 



Karen Griggs 

hs usual, Thanksgiving got lost 
again. The fake Christmas trees 
arc up already. Neon Santa Claus' 
is back in town. So stop and pon- 
der, as you hurriedly eat buttered 
turkey, rushing through Christmas 
shopping madness, that thousands 
of innovenl children STARVE in 
Biafro, (and America) . Others 
sleep in concrete bunkers in Is- 
rael, in the streets in Saigon and 



India. How can you have an 
appetite for mashed potatoes or 
cranberry sauce when malnutri- 
tion exists in Mississippi? What 
ever happened to our "Fading 
Pledge in Appalachia'? Go ahead, 
choke down that rich food, keep 
up your strength. It's too late for 
tivo million children in Biafro. 
They never osked for this violent 
world. Born without opportunity 
for peace, even life, now they will 
die. May il be swift and merciful.
