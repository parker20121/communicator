NAVY OFFICER. 

YOU GET RESPONSIBILITY THE MOMENT 
YOU GET THE STRIPES. 



A lot of big corporations offer you a big 
title. But how many offer a young college 
graduate a really important job? 

As a Navy Officer, you don't have 
to wait to do a job that counts. We give 
you one as soon as you've earned your 
commission. A job with responsibility for 
the lives of others, and for millions of dollars 
of complex equipment. A job that requires 
skill and leadership. A job that Navy Officers 
have been doing proudly for 200 years. 

If that's the kind of job you're looking 
for, speak to a Navy recruiter. You'll find 
that Navy Officers have unequalled 
opportunities in fields like Nuclear Power, 
Aviation, and Engineering. 
Or call toll free 800-841-8000. (In Georgia,
