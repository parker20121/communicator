Helmke campaigns 
for House seat 



By CHARLES PRATT 

State Senator Walter P. Helmke, 
candidate for the Republican con- 
gressional nomination, visited the 
campus last Monday afternoon. 
During the course of his visit, he was 
interviewed concerning his past 
experience in public service and on 
the issues confronting him in his 
campaign. 

Senator Helmke, a member of the 
law firm of Helmke, Beams, Boyer 
and Wagner, served in the office of 
the Prosecuting Attorney of Allen 
County from 1962 to 1970. In 1970, 
Helmke was elected to serve in the 
State Senate, an office he has held 
since that time. In 1971, Helmke was 
named by his peers as the best 
freshman legislator in either house. 
Now, with the completion of his term 
of State Senator, he is actively 
seeking the Republic "nod" to run for 
Congress in the Fourth District. 

During his term as S'ate Senator, 
Helmke supported legislation to 
protect the environment of Indiana. 
In addition to supporting the ban on 
phosphates, Hetmke voted in favor of 
creating an Environmental Manage- 
ment Board. This act created a board 
from the existing officials in the 
Department of Health and the 
Department of Natural Resources. 
This agency will be responsible for 
the enforcement of Indiana's Clean 
Air Act in addition to protecting the 
state's general environment. 

Concerning the fate of the 
regional campuses across the state, 
Helmke believed that, "within the 
next four to six years autonomy will 
probably be granted to the regional 
campuses." He cautioned, however, 
that before that time, the State 
Legislature will have to be convinced 
that the Higher Education Commis- 



sion will be a strong functioning body. 
Helmke believes that the HEC must 
be able to prevent overlappings of 
programs and be able to provide a 
greater service to the legislature in 
presenting fiscal policies of each 
independent campus. 

In regard to national fiscal 
policies, Helmke displayed disgust 
that the average Indiana citizen 
received little for his tax dollar. 
Helmke stated that, "because Indiana 
ranks dead last in what we receive 
back from our tax dollar, but tenth in 
the country in what we pay per capita 
in federal income taxes, it is 
important that we aggressively seek 
the return of our taxes from existing 
federal programs for education, 
environment, mental health and 
retardation programs and highway 



candidates were: 
William A. Jenkins, dean of the School 
of Education of Portland State 
University; Stanley B. Kegler, vice- 
president for administration of the 
University of Minnesota; Charles J.

istic Studies of Aspen Institute; 



chancellor and dean of administration 
affairs at Indiana University-Purdue 
University at Indianapolis; Donald 
Schwartz, acting president of State 
University College at Buffalo; and 
John Williams Snyder, executive vice 
chancellor of the University of 
California. 

Kegler withdrew his application 
after the announcement. 

Each of the six men were on 
campus two days, being interviewed 
by students, faculty and staff. The 
interviews began the first week after 
spring break and ended last week.

"a great need to cut the fat out of the 
budget." Helmke stated that the Cost 
of Living Council announced that the 
waste and inefficiency in the 
expansive budget is the cause of 
inflation. Helmke called for Congress 
to reduce expenditures and to balance 
the budget so as to curtail inflation. 
Helmke also expressed his oppo- 



to federal

Helmke, a lifelong resident of the 
fourth district, is an active member of 
the Kiwanis Club of Fort Wayne, the

also serves the Criminal Justice

Athletic committee trying 
to get full-time b-ball coach 



By ROLAND CLEMENTS 

Can you imagine a college varsity 
basketball team going on a road trip 
without its head coach? This actually 
happened to the Indiana-Purdue 
basketball team this year. The 
problem arose because of a road trip 
scheduled at mid-week and the coach 
was unable to get time off from his 
regular job. 

This is only one example of the 
problems of a part-time coach. In 
basketball this past year Coach 
George Whrmeister was forced to 
work as a full time teacher at 
Heritage High School as well as lead 



m. Coaches in 
and baseball 
employees. 

The campus Joint Athletic Advi- 
sory Committee is once again 
attempting to find a full time position 
for the coaches among the campus 
employees. The JAAC sees several 
distinct advantages to a coach who is 
on campus full time. The coach could 



maintain better relations with the 
players as well as find new players on 
the campus. A full time coach could 
also improve the counseling for the 
ballplayers to keep them eligible and 
moving towards a degree. Hopefully a 
full time coach could work on 
schedules so that the whole team 
could work together. 

The search for full time positions 
has been accelerated by the recent 
departures of Coach Wehrmeister in 
basketball and Coach Johns in soccer. 
The JAAC hopes to know in the*near 
future if any positions on campus will 
be opening soon. The JAAC hopes to 
fill both coaching vacancies at its 
May 13 meeting. 

The Communicator has learned 
from John P. Ulmer, dean of student 
services, that no resignations from 
the staff have been received. There 
are also several other obstacles to 
hiring a full time coach. Many 
departments are already under-staff- 



There is also a Purdue University 
policy against paying full time 
employees extra for part-time work,

FEAR AND LOATHING AT IU-PU 



'Universitas Actus Infantalus' 



This year ! 
overdue-day ca 



Day care inflation 

m the implementation of the long studied-and long 
e center. But somewhere between what we wanted and 
nething went wrong. 

First of all, the cost of providing the service proved to be much 
greater than expected. What started as a $6000 one time only, Student 
Senate allocation with a $.50 an hour fee, has, in the course of one year, 

become an annually recurring $10, Si udenl subsidy with a $.75 per hour 

charge, 

What Studenl Services, of which I he cenler is a part, found was that 
the wage bill was much higher than anticipated, while the utilization of 
the cenler by students, especially night-timers, was down. These two 
factors can wreak havoc on even the best planned budget in short order. 

There is a second thing thai is wrong in Trom 1, and this problem is in 
part responsible tor the financial woes of the center. The problem centers 
on the application of the objective of the day care center. 

The center was established for one and only one reason : to enable 
parents to come back to school or to increase their course loads. Studies 
have shown that the presence of inexpensive day care on campus 
increases the total number of credit hours enrolled. The service was 
intended to reach the 20 per cent-plus of IU-PU students who have 
children. 

Decision was made to build an "educational experience" into the 
center. The center would offer more than simple baby-sitting. 

It is important to note that an "educational experience" is not the 
purpose of the center. II is merely an added attraction. The center's only 
purpose for existence remains the same. 

This decision to make the center an "educational experience" has 
directly increased the cost of operating the center Higher salaries must 
be paid to attract college graduates as head and assistant teachers. 

This has also led to the determination on the part of the staff to 
minimize or eliminate volunteer or cooperative help. Volunteers are 
people who work for nothing, and coop workers are parent-users who 
work in exchange for free child care. 

Using volunteers and co-op workers would greatly decrease the wage 
bill of the center Hence, il stands to reason that this would also reduce 
the user fee and amount of the Student Senate subsidy. Parents would 
save money and the student body would save activity money for other 
uses. Co-op work plans would also help those students who are operating 
on austerity budgets, and most are. 

The staff of the center complains that such programs would endanger 
the "educational experience" now offered. This is true only if one "buys" 
the premise that parents are not "qualified" to care for children. 

It is the opinion of Ibis newspaper that many involved with the center 
firmly believe this premise This ties into the theory that child-raising 
and education should be taken from the parents and given to the 
professionals," so that society can better control the "educational 
experience." 

This attitude has been responsible for increased costs in operating 
the center. The higher user's fee and student subsidy are a definite 
movement away from the objective of the center. A means is being 
substituted for the end. 

The Communicator urges Studenl Services to consider the following

"What we have here is basically a 
failure to communicate," said Profes- 
sor Heinrich Gerbil, world renowned 
expert on just about everything. 

"One of the universities does 
something that the other does not like 
and the oilier one does something else 
to get back at the one who offended in 
the first place." 

Gerbil said that this gives him a 
great chance to prove his theory of

anything but adult. 

"I would have to say that the 
Purdue Accounting Department lADt 
here is just one great big on-going 
example of my theory." said Gerbil. 

"Their every action is done in the 
manner of a child hoarding his 
pennies. Everytime it looks like 
someone is going to do anything as 
nasty as withdrawing money for a 
worthwhile cause, the AD. stages a 
temper tantrum of gigantic propor- 

The Professor cited the trouble

Gerbil noted that ev 



Students' Government had legally 
appropriated money for the paper, 
the A.D. stalled. He mentioned the 
mysterious loss of check requests 
after approval by the various board of 
the lease back in November of 1973. 

He enumerated the various 
tactics used by the office to slow up 
any payment at all to the paper. 

"The officials felt threatened by 
the presence on this campus of a free 
spirit that they could not control," 
Gerbil noted. "Then, as all infants do 
when they feel threatened, they went 
crying for Daddy. In this case Purdue 
Vice-President and Treasurer (Fred) 
Ford." 



"Ford took them aside, patted 
them on the head, and said 'Do not 
worry fellas, daddy will screw them 
up for you.' He did just that by 
threatening to take the matter to the 
board of trustees," said Gerbil. It took 
a remarkable effort by Roger 
Manges, dean and director of Purdue 
here, to defuse the situation before a 
press conference was called by the 
paper's staff and the student Search 
and Screen people acted." 

Gerbil saw no real hope for the 
future maturity of the two institu- 
tions. "It's really sad that the 
offspring is, in many ways, more 
mature than the parents."

friends. Almost every guest I spoke to 
was in real estate, one of whom I 
recognized as a biggie in the field. 

"Are you a good friend of the

mayor's introduction of Bess Myerson

Beame's unraised consciousness

But this was no great moment of

We could have had the most

An Open Letter to the Student Body: 
In the last two years, Indiana- 
Purdue at Fort Wayne has expanded 
both physically and academically. 
During this period, Brock Able and 
the ABC Party have served as the 
elected voice of the student body. 

Due to the fact that Brock Able 
and the ABC Party have completed 
their obligations as representees; it 
is proper, therefore, that their 
accomplishments over the past two 
years be summerized. 

Brock Able, president of the 
student body and leader of the ABC 
Party, was directly responsible for 
the establishment of a Day Care 
Center on our campus and the 
organization of the Multiple Sclerosis 
Marathon. Furthurmore, Brock Able, 
with the assistance of Mike Folk, 
must be accredited with gaining a 
substantial reduction in the parking 
fees as well as the initial effort toward 
cleaning the Lagoon area. In addition 
to these accomplishments, Brock 
Able also served Ruth Lantz on the 
Student Union Board Committee, a 
e which was responsible for 



The student delegation to the 
Chancellor Search and Screen Com- 
mittee was entirely composed of ABC 
Party members. Those serving o 

Able. 

Dave James, chairman of the 
Convocations Committee, should be 



recognized for the outstanding ser- 
vices he has provided the students. 
They included the Mac Davis 
concert, the Grass Roots concert, and 
the annual Harbor Arbor Days Pig 
Roast. 

The Film Series should also be 
commended for providing a broad 



.ffilm 



campus under the combined leader- 
ship of Mike Pfundstein, Vicki 
Dossier and Rollie Clements 

Never to be forgotten is Mike 
Yann, past chairman of the Student 
l nion Hoard and an elected member 
of the ABC Party. Mike and the entire 
Union Board should be commended 
for the quality of musical entertain- 
ment they have provided for young 
adults of our community. 

Especially noteworthy \ 



The ABC Party was responsible 
for the funding of PIT, Debate Club, 
University Singers, the newspaper, 
and Impressions. 

However, none of the above 
activities would have been possible 
without John Gerber who acted as 
Student Body Treasurer. 

Yes, in fact. Brock Able and the 

ABC Party have been an Alliance for 

Belter Campus.

Harbor Arbor Days... 
a mass celebration 



Sunshine and entertainment drew over 10,000 people lo celebrate the 
coming of spring during (he annual Harbor Arbor Days at 
Indiana-Purdue last weekend. 

Friday was a day for feasting and film-watching, The Pig Roast 
offered shaved pork sandwiches, slaw and soft drinks to anyone willing to 
eat along the flowering shrubs on the cement mall between the Library 
and Student Union. 

n . In the evening a Film Orgy was free with films such as Butch 
Cassiday and the Sundance Kid, Vanishing Point, The April Fools, and 
Slaughterhouse Five. Both of Friday's activities hiitJ capacity crowds. 

Over 10,000 people attended (he band festival on the patio of the 
cafetewria Saturday, Although five bands were going to perform 
according to the Student Union Board's publicity, only three played 
Saturday. This crowd was an all time record for attendance at any 
Indiana-Purdue event.

First say to yourself, "I'd like to

whole car and pay for it little by little

machine handy, that works oul to a

CONCERNED CAMPUS CITIZENS 

Ruth Kearns says it was refreshing and reassuring to 
mark the volume of inquiries concerning the annual library 
sale which is one of the regular features of the celebration of 
National Library Week. Ruth explained to all the quiz kids 
that NO library books were being sold from the stacks. 
What goes on sale annually are the donated books and other 
materials that the library is not being ravaged, the students 
usually want to know what happens to the money. Ruth 
t for 

just like the venerable tradition of the farm wife's egg 
money. The intake of the annual sale goes to cover student 
requests that do not quite fit into any specific expentiture' 
category, but do seem to merit fulfillment. So you see, book 
buyers, the quarters you cast upon the counter are coming 

A MINI VIEW 

Marc Atz had his feet propped up on a third floor table 
at Neff and claimed to be 'just coasting.' A page full of notes 
and his pen in hand, rather destroyed that image. Marc 
says he has been easing up for the past six weeks. It was 
that long ago, he was informed he had been accepted by the 
American University at Washington D.C. for graduate 
work. That is a heady reinforcer for anyone interested in 
the field of Public Administration. Marc says the thrill goes 
on while the planning for the far away place goes on apace 
Young Mrs. Atz is a bit apprehensive about the 'big city,' 
but Marc has promised her a once over thoroughly of 
everything Washington D.C. has to offer in the next two 
years. After that? He doesn't really think he'll run for 
mayor. But he'd like an appointive, not elective, office in his 
field. 
WHO MAKES THE SECRETARY'S COFFEE? 

Or a day in the life of a work -study person, begins early, 
as early as five thirty some mornings, if you are Mary 
Enyeart and have to drive in from Huntington, with your 
fiance Pat Smith in time to arrive for his seven thirty class. 
Petite and pretty Mary gets the coffee perking over at 
Sociology and Anthro, and the hot water bubbling for Marty , 
Zusman's tea, then she's ready to don her track shoes. Part 
of her work is to "Run for everybody, everywhere." The 
bright young English major loves it all, but wishes the time 



2 bought their trailer home and car, and have even 
been discussing dog pet types. All is not completely perfect. 
Mary has a small nagging fear What is the hotel clerk 
going to look or say when they register as "Mr. and Mrs. 
Smith" on their honeymoon. The best solution seems to be 
to employ Pat's middle name, "Mr. and Mrs. Pat Thorn 
Smith," sounds sufficiently distinctive to rise above the 
John Smiths on any registry. 

THE LAST ROUND UP IU-PU MOSAIC 

Bev Johnson was among the Florida fortunates at 
spring break. She promised to post a card to home stuck 
Denise Yaney. Mid way thru the week a card showed up in 
the clutch of mail. "They've got a building down there that 
looks like out Lincoln Bank!" thought the bouncy member 
of Hess's Hussies (Dr. Hess's speech teams are frequently 
titlted toward the female side. I Then she turned it over and 
found Mary Makris hoping she was having a fine vacation in 
Fort Wayne too!— Janis Hunt studying very hard in the 
bvasement of Kettler, and 'just hoping' to pass that test in 
abnormal psych so she can count some more credits toward 
her associate degree in mental health — Dr. Sheldon 
Gottlieb observing that the conservatives in Congress are 
carrying their 'saving' ways too far, when they conserve 
their needed votes when environmental bills are being 
balloted. — If you are in classes with Steve Christman, you 
have probably noticed he is usually in attendance, even 
when you cut. Steve attributes his persistant presence to a 
'combination of regimentation, resignation and self 
discipline ' — What will we use for a biological clock next 
fall? This semester regular as the incoming tides or 
Capistrano swallows, we could count on that euchre game 
at the couch in Kettler 11:30 sharp. — Those large 
and many stacks of aluminum beer cans stacked near the 
library and elsewhere, did NOT represent the start of a 
recycling industry here on campus, but only the left overs 
from that shattering Saturday marathon musical. — You 
might ask for Dave Wall's autograph graduation night, just 
in case. The English major is preparing a paper publication 
in an English journal, and has two novels past the embryo 
stage. — Ruth Langhinrichs sitting in her office late one 
afternoon clipping coupons-grocery coupons. — How far 
does the Communicator spread its newsprint? David 
Zehner was recently in receipt of a letter from Ted 
Kennedy. The last of the Kennedy scions said in part, ' ' Your 
article in the November 29, 1973, edition of the 
INDIANA-PURDUE COMMUNICATOR moved me deep- 
ly." David might let you see the real thing if you ask like a 
Democrat.

Mastodon t&lt; 
but there have been ; 
pathetic siti 

The tennis team began the season first, and they 
finished with a very respectable 7-4 record. Charles 
Bolyard, head coordinator of the counseling center, was the 
head tennis coach, and he was assisted by Benjamin 
Becker, a professor of biology at IU-PU. 

Seniors Galen Yordy, Steve Spoltman, and John Saurer 
were joined by Tom White. Steve Beltz, Dave Goldsmith. 
Mike Schone, and Mike Corner as the key players on the 

Spoltman boasted the best record at 20-1, while every 
other player but one won more matches than he lost. 

It has been established thai the tennis team will have its 
own tennis courts in the near future. Home courts will be a 
great advantage for the team. Perhaps it will give the 
students an opportunity to support them. 

The tennis squad should be tough again next year, as 
they have several returning lettermen. They have creted a 
healthy image of IU-PU's tennis program with their quality 
performances. 

The cross-country team was able to win several meets 
in their first year of existence Don Heim was their most 
consistent runner, but they had good all around team depth. 
Frank Chorba, a communications professor, and James E. 
Gilbert, academic dean at IU-PU, were often seen running 
ahead of their squad in practice. 

The IU-PU soccer team got little recognition this year, 
but even though their record was not impressive, they 
displayed some good soccer techniques throughout the 

The Mastodon basketvall team had a long, 
disappointing season, as they were hit with numerous 
injuries throughout the year. 

They won only five games, but played some exciting 
basketball, and often scored over a hundred points. George 
Wehrmeister and Larry Hoyle shared coaching duties for 
the 73-74 season. 

Junior Rex Putt was named to the all-city first five, 
while his brother Dean was named to the all-tourney team 
in the city tournament at the beginning of the year. 

Gary Trump, Gary Gray, Dave Peterson, Keith 
Mendenhall, and Dan Grussing all average near the 10 point 
per game level. 

The Mastodons, who have not had a .500 season in three 
years, will have a new coach next year. 

The baseball team is presently suffering through a hard 
luck season, as they have showed some talent, but have 
been inconsistant in the three basic areas of the game. 

The diamond nine has had some good pitching by 
freshman Dean Lehrman and Gary Drake, but have had 
trouble with their fielding. 

Gary Trump and Dean Lehrman have led a good hitting 
attack for the Mastodons. Trump was the team's leading 
hitter last year. 

Hal Prickett is the head coach of the baseball team, and 
he is assisted by David Hey. 

The golf team has been impressive this year. They have 
already taken fifth and second places in the IU-PU and 
Tri-State invitationals, and have shown good team depth. 

Edwin C. Leonard, a business professor, coaches the 
golfers, and has given over 25 of them a chance to play 
competitive college golf. 

Skip Lesh has been shooting remarkably well for the 
Mastodons, and Gary Ream, Sherm Lewis and Stacy Clark 
among others have done a fine job. 

The golf team is capable of having the best record of 
any Mastodon team this year. If they continue to improve 
they should finish very respectably. 

The golf team has gained a good reputation for the golf 
program at IU-PU. Coach Leonard can be credited with the 
success, as he has recruited some fine golfers. 



well. I can at least brag of picking the division wir 
earlier predicted Boston to take Milwaukee in seven, and I 
will stick to that prediction. At the time of this writing 
Boston had a 1-0 lead in the series. The Celtic's coach Tom 
Heinsohn said that they were going to let Jabbar do the 
scoring and stop the other four Buck palyers. That is 
exactly what happoened in the first game, j'abbar had 35 
and the team only had 83 points. As long as Havlicek and 
Cowans continue playing the quality of ball they have been 
playing, Milwaukee is going to have problems.
