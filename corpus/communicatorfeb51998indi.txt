CAKAPl IQTHFFT- 3 continuing problem, 

w-u vi r ^ j incn,^ po//ce offer solutions 



By Dooe Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Bar generations the relative seclu- 
sion of college campuses has 
lulled some students and (acuity 
into a false sense of security. 
The recent events on college cam- 
puses nationwide have not painted 
a picture of tranquillity for America's 
learning institutions. 

IPFW is similar to many of the 
nation's universities In addition to com- 
petitive degree programs and opporiuni- 
ties, a number of colleges and universities 
are linked by the common thread of crime 
on campus. 

It would seem that IPFW would he vir- 
tually free of crime, but that is not the case. 
Crime at IPFW is quite low, compared 
with the city of Fort Wayne and lo other 
campuses, but the problem of illegal 
activity still persists 

A major problem for IPFW is book 
theft. Thefts occur in academic buildings, 
(including the library) out of lockers and, 
quite often, thefts occur out of parked 
vehicles. 

Theft from lockers has been a particu- 
lar nuisance this year, according to Police 
and Safety 

Practically since its inception, IPFW 
has had a police department. At first, there 
was no need (or a large corps of officers 
since the only building that constituted 
IPFW was Ketller Hall. 

Currently, Police and Safety consists 
of 10 sworn officers, one chief, three dis- 
patchers, and four security guards. 

The average amount of career expert- 



ence for the department is 25 years. 

"We're roughly the size of the 
Columbia City Police Department" says 
Officer Ron Motz. 

All of the officers were trained at the 
Law Enforcement Academy in Plainficld. 

Even a group of seasoned officers can- 
not prevent all crime on campus 

In a recent example, an IPFW student 
purchased textbooks at Foiletl's and left 
them momentarily unattended in Helmkc 
Library. 

The books were stolen and taken to 
Foiletl's for re-sale shortly thereafter. 

This incident is not the first of its kind 
to lake place at IPFW. 

The university has constructed and 
enforces policies in an effort to reduce the 
number of thefts and cases of fraud 

In order to help prevent fraud in the 
library, staff may ask for additional identi- 
fication if the name on the university ser- 
vices card and an individual's physical 
characteristics do not seem to match. 

"If (a woman) gives me a card with a 
man's name on it, she will be asked for 
extra ID.," says Library Director Judy 
Violet te. 

Nearly everyone who has used the 
Helmke Library has heard the alarm sound 
as someone attempted to exit. 

However, Violette explains that it is 
not a significant event each time the alarm 
sounds. It also does not mean that someone 
has stolen something. 

The alarm simply means that a library 
item has passed by the detector 

That is why library borrowers should 
remember to pass library materials along 
the designated counter area so that the sen- 
sitive detector is not set off. 

The detector and scrutiny of the uni- 
versity services card are nearly as far as the 



library can feasibly go within the means of 
its budget. 

"I know theft happens. It happens in 
every library." says Violette "It would be 
too expensive to pay for the staff it would 
take to continually watch for thieves." 

Although this year has not been partic- 
ularly plagued with thefts, there was an 
incident involving an individual who had a 
large amount of fines on her card. 

When she could no longer use the card 
because of fines, she applied for a card 
using the name of her 3-month old child. 

When she attempted to use the card 
issued to the infant, she was caught. 

People who are caught stealing library 
materials are reported to the dean of stu- 
dents for violation of the student code. 

Those who commit misdemeanors or 
felonies are charged with the crime and 
serve jail lime, if applicable, after being 
reported to the dean of students. 

Parking permits are another area that is 
carefully monitored by Police and Safety. 

While the worry or ensuring that a 
parking permit is properly displayed has 
been eliminated for students, the bother- 
some task of patrolling parking areas 
remains. 

"It's physically impossible to watch all 
lots," said Mot?.. "Students can almost do 
what they want as far as the parking is con- 
cerned." 

Users of the campus can assist in mak- 
ing IPFW safer by following common 
sense guidelines in securing their belong- 
ings. 

Persistent safeguards could create a 
permanent deterrent. 

Questions regarding safety issues can 
be forwarded to Police and Safety at 481- 
6911. 




Campus Safety Tips 



Here are some safety tips to help prevent both property loss and 
provide personal safety while on campus: 

1. Lock your car doors. Do not leave full book bags in plain view 
in a vehicle-put them in the trunk. 

2. Keep purses and other accessories close to your body when 
walking around campus so a potential thief cannot easily grab 
the item. 

3. Never leave valuable items unattended in the library or other 
building. 

4. Lock all office doors. 

5. Trust your instincts. If you feel threatened, get to a safe place 
immediately. 

6. Report any suspicious activity to Police and Safety at once. 

7. For emergencies, Police and Safety may be reached immedi- 
ately by picking up the receiver of a campus emergency tele- 
phone and pushing a button. The phone lines remain connected 
to a dispatcher for five minutes. The phones can pick up voices 
from as far away as 20 feet. There are dispatchers available 24 
hours a day to assist with emergency calls.

Your Turn: Terrence Do, 



I am a blessed man. Three limes 
I have been in the presence of a 
saint. 

One. 1 traveled a great distance 
lo see and risked my life in doing 
so, another 1 brought here from 
many miles a\yay to share her life, 
and the third 1 rode my bike to her 
house. . 

Maria Reiche was in her late 
80's, blinded and crippled by 
Parkinson's disease, when I visited 
her in her home in Nasca. l'cru. 

But this lady who devoted her 
life to the poor indigenous people of 
Peru and whose vigilance in study- 
ing and preserving the Nasca Lines 
was lo make her world famous after 
a life of obscurity and poverty, bad a 
spirit touched by fire. 

As did Sepuma Clark, also in 
her 80's at the time of our meeting. 
Septima's passion was lo the poor 
blacks of the south who were shut 
out of America's minds and political 
system. 

Her work to get blacks to vote 
led her to be a mentor to other aspir- 
ing black leaders. One such young 
man rose to world prominence, and 
when be made his journey to 
Norway to accept his Nobel Peace 
Prize; he asked Seplima Dark lo 
accompany him. 

His name was Dr. Martin Luther 
KingJr 

My third saint, well, she too was 



in ber 80's when we met, and she 
never rose to fame beyond litUe oT 
Fort Wayne. 

But her devotion to -the poor 
was legendary, and her vows of 
poverty in her own life make her 
every bit die equal of Maria and 
Seplima, and even of her own hero. 
Mother Theresa. 

1 first met Miss Virginia several 
years, ago when, with my friend 
Jamie Smead, I was making a docu- 
mentary, "Voices of Hunger." for 
the Community Harvest Food Bank. 
She was so gracious and humble, 
and yet outspoken in ber simple 
way, that I knew I was in the pres- 
ence of greatness 

She paid us the great honor of 
attending our premiere held ai 
IPFW, and I remember her still, sit- 
ting in that room, commenting, 
"The Pope could feed the hungry 
just with the money be spends on 
furnishings in the Vatican." 

That statement was classic Miss 
Virginia. It didn't matter who you 
were, if you weren't doing your part 
to erase poverty, then you were 
going to hear about it from Miss 
Virginia. 

Whenever friends came into 
town, especially from another coun- 
try. 1 always look them down to 
meet her. I wanted to show ihem 
there was somebody in this (own I 
was proud of. But the time I remem- 



ber the most about Miss Virginia 
had nothing to do with TV cameras 
or meeting new fnends 

A few years ago she was in the 
hospital. I had told my Dad and 
brothers about this remarkable 
woman, and they all went with me 
to visit her. Even in her helpless 
condition she managed a smile, and 
squeezed our hands 

1 never fell so close to my fam- 
ily as I did at that moment 
Spontaneously, with no discussion 
of any kind, each of us reached in 
our pockels and gave her a donation 
for her work 

It wasn'i the money of course. It 
was the gesture, the feeling behind 
it that motivated the contribution, 
tti.it made the moment so special. 

We all shared something that 
day lhat went beyond words, or 
even thought. Call it spiril. 

That's what a saint can do for 
you. Elevate you to a place you've 
never been, a higher ground, and if 
we aren't able to stay there. Being 
the mere mortals we are, jusi being 
there makes us realize such a spot 
exists And we know we can aim 
higher. 

I wish I had told Miss Virginia 
tin- I wish I had told Maria and 
Seplima what knowing mem meant 
lo mi. I'm telling them now. 



Rules 



Wc believe thai more of us need 
lo gel involved with this positive 
organization. 



Since last week wc ragged on 
ihe cafeteria and the bookstore, this 
week wc thought we would continue 
looking at IPFW organizations. 

The Student Activities Board 
(SAB) always seems to be doing 
something for the student body at 
IPFW. 

Jusi last weekend ihey held a 
carnival in the Walb Ballroom for 
students and their children There 
were various 
games including 
cake walks and a 
clown lhat enter- 
tained the chil- 
dren. 

During the fall ... 
and spring SAB WE KNOW THIS IS A COM

There are times when SAB col- 
laborates wilh oihcr IPFW organiza- 
tions. The carnival lasi weekend 
brought in help from the BCC 

Coming up events thai need vol- 
unteers include a Vegas Night on 
Feb 17 If you consider yourself a 
good dealer, you're needed 

In April SAB 
will join up 
w i i b 
Hisp anos 
Unidos for a 



presents 

fun such as con- 
certs in the gazebo 
and fair-like fun 
on the lawn by 
Walb. 

Last fall they 
sponsored a licket 
giveaway for the 
country concert of 
Tracey Lawrence 
and Trace Adkins 
Not to mention 
that all IPFW slu- 
denis received a 
discount on Iheir 
tickets for the con- 
cert. 

Presently. 
SAB makes avail- 
able to the stu- 
dents discounted 
movie tickets lo all 
Regal Cinemas. 
For $4, .25 we can 
gain entry into just 
about any movie. r 

SAB is also 
teaming up with 
ihe Cinema Cenier 
lo offer us SI. 00 
movies on 
Saturday after- 
noons The movies 
are new and current. 

For instance, the new movie 
wilh Wesley Snipes is included 

Look for the SAB flyer around 
campus to see what movies Ihey are 
and Ihe dates and limes. 

The Philharmonic of Fori 
Wayne has also joined the ranks of 
SAB Through SAB we arc able to 
purchase discounted tickets for con- 
cerls performed by the 
Philharmonic. 

The only problem SAB seems to 
collide with is the lack of participa- 
tion by us. the students. 

Most of the students that help 
with ihe planning and organizing are 
volunteers. Right now. SAB only 
has five steady student volunteers. 



MUTER CAMPUS, BUT 



STUDENTS CAN STILL GET 



INVOLVED WITH THEIR 



COLLEGE ORGANIZA- 



TIONS. If we don't they 



COULD DISAPPEAR, JUST 



ASK THE PEOPLE 



INVOLVED WITH UNAS, 



THE SKI CLUB OR HOCKEY 



should get in 
louch with 
SAB. 

If we 
want to con- 
tinue to have 
the benefits 
Of SAB then 
we need to do 
our pan 

Students 
need to keep 
their eyes 
open for 
events that 
interest them 
and then 
■ , ,q become a 

LUD - partofthem. 

We know 
this is a com- 
muter cam- 
pus, but stu- 
dents can still 
get involved 
with their college organizations 

If we don't then they could dis- 
appear lust ask the people involved 
wilh UNAS, ihe ski club or hockey 
club. 

We believe lhat involvement is 
ibe key lo a betier variety of oppor- 
tunities at IPFW 

For anyone that plans on landing 
a career after college, being able lo 
include activities on your resume 
thai you were involved in ai school 
is important. Especially if you were 
to hold a position of leadership. 

By gelling involved not only 
will you be helping your university 
organizations but your future as 
well.

Outside Looking In: Gall Ru6le 



"To find yourself, think for your- 
self"- Socrates 

"1 know I'm not seeing things as 
they are. I'm seeing things as I 
am. "-- Laurel Lee 

Every so often, 1 get the urge to 
be alone. Well, actually. I gel die 
urge to be flat-out antisocial. I jusi 
wanna be alone. No excuses, no 
explanations. I just wanna be by 
myself. ! need lime to think about 
my life 

This urge doesn't come wilh any 
warnings', n just appears. I guess mat 
I have the tendency to shut down to 
Ibe outside world once in awhile I 
do il because there's something 
inside me that screams for peace and 
quiet. It's this innate pari of mc lhat 
longs for placidity, for contempla- 
tion, for meditation. 

Deep inside the mask thai is my 
life, there is a clear, calm voice lhat 
makes me notice the things that I 
don't often pay enough attention to. 

I need lime to think about things 
in my life, and God knows, life itself 
sure doesn't give me the opportunity 
to find such time. So I have to make 
time on my own time, by my own 
terms. I guess that 1 do everything 
like that, by my own terms. 1 like my 
life mat way 

Sometimes il feels like the walls 
of my life are closing in on mc loo 
fast, and I'm just a runner in a race 



watching the ghost of my own life 
dash right past me. And I feel like 
I'm losing my life to that spectre. 
But how do you lose the race of your 
life to ihe ghost of yourself? 

Answer; you lose it when you 
give up control of your life and it 
plans itself, oftentimes leaving you 
behind in ihe process. In other 
words, you stop paying attention to 
who you are inside, and worry loo 
much about what's waiting at the 
finish line. 

One of my favorite quotes is. 
"Your life is your message'' (that's 
actually a book tide, but I've adopt- 
ed it as a personal quote). lis 
become my mantra-of-sorts. If I 
close my eyes and pay attention to 
the path I'm following and the lega- 
cy I am leaving in my wake, things 
become much clearer. 

In these times of placidity, I 
realize just how much I want to be 
responsible for making my own 
judgments, creating my own 
philosophies about wbo 1 am, exam- 
ining why I was given this life and 
deciding what I am going lo do wilh 
the life I've chosen to lead. 

I realize lhat I am responsible 
for those things. No one else is 
responsible for me And I am learn- 
ing to lake thai responsibility for 
creating my own happiness. // my 
life is happy, it is because I made u 
that way. I have no one but myself to 



blame for the way my life is. 
because my life is a resull of my 
choices. Removing outside respon- 
sibility for mistakes is an empower- 
ing, sometimes even healing, feel- 
ing. 

I think lhat I chose to have my 
private, peaceful, alone moments so 
lhat I can take a look inside myself 
to make changes or examine choic- 
es These moments re-affirm my 
humanity and they reaffirm my 
strength 

They let mc know thai, yes, I do 
have control over my life, no mailer 
how much it may seem (o the con- 
trary If I don't like a current path, 1 
can take a different route. 

I have the power to right my 
wrongs I am not immutable: / can 
change. 

In essence, these meditative, 
reflective moments prove that I have 
the ability to face the truth mat 
exists within me. I'm still searching 
for the whole of lhat truth, but I'm 
no longer afraid of (he search, nor of 
where it wdl lead mc 

I trust myself because I have 
realized thai only I control my des- 
tiny There's a certain peace and 
comfort in that 

There's an old saying that goes, 
"At any moment I could start beiDg 
a better person- but which moment 
should I choose?" 

/ choose now.

Atliluilos toward disabilities need to grow 



Page 3 



What I think: Heidi Heinecfe, guest columnist 



[tiere art many obstacles lac- 
ing individuals with disabilities in 
this country I believe all the obsta- 
cles can be attributed to the nega- 
tive ailiiude that society has as a 
whole toward individuals with dis- 
abilities. 

For example, as I wheel myself 
down a hall or sidewalk, mother's 
whisper "SShhh" to their curious 
children and pull them close as if I 
am going to run (hem down, 



scream, or as if my disability, Spina

What's Weak This Week: Dennis Donafiue 



"Rock and Roll is genocide," 
that's what Bowie said I think 
MTV ruined rock, so I've come up 
with a few suggestions to help 
complement the lame CD's that 
most of you probably own Much 
of this music is from the 70's and 
SO's. so be patient, something could 
surprise you. Be warned, if you lis- 
ten to local radio, you probably 
won't like any of this. If you keep 
an open mind and just listen to 
some of my suggestions, you might 
discover that old rock still rules. Go 
on. keep reading. 

I don't have a particular order. 
but from what I own, here is some 
cool music that 1 think everyone 
should have Most music "critics" 
always give mention to the new 
groups that pollute our airwaves 
Some writers in a local free weekly 
publication mention groups that no 
one has heard of 1 guess this makes 
them feel smart Not me, you've 
beard of every one I'll mention and 
I won't insult your intelligence. 

What do you think? Has it real- 
ly gotten as bad as it could get? I 
mentioned the Spice Girl's disease 
a couple weeks ago. Remember 
bow cool REM used to be? What 
has happened to Rock 'n Roll? Can 
Jewel. Fiona Apple and Oasis save 
the day? I doubt it. They are not the 
first to copy what has already been 
done in the world of music and they 
won't be the last. 

Let's start in the 60s The only 
Rolling Stones you need to own is 
"Beggars Banquet" from 1968. 
Blues, rock and some classics like 
"Street Fighting Man" and 
"Sympathy for the Devil." If you 
must, go out and buy "Hot Rocks." 
This is son of a greatest hits double 
album. I also recommend anything 
from Jefferson Airplane. This was a 
group that influenced The Dead. 
Their early stuff on "2400 Fulton 
Street" will bring you back to the 
"Summer of Love " In 1970, Black 
Sabbath released "Paranoid." This 
moody death rock/occult album 
was the cornerstone for what was to 
be known as "acid rock" and it still 
tears it up 28 years later. This my 
friends, is heavy metal Thanks 
Ozzy! 

The early 70's wasn't all hard 
rock though. Joni Mitchell's "Court 
and Spark" treated us to such clas- 
sics as "Help Me" and the timeless 



title track. Ever wonder who influ- 
enced today's so called folk singers 
like the ones you hear on The 
Edge? It was Mitchell and Joan 
Baez, they were both at Woodstock, 
pretty cool, huh? Let us not forget 
Janis. If I have to mention ber last 
name, you are too young Blues 
must come from the heart, and 
Jams Joplin bad the blues. I recom- 
mend her 1973 album "Pearl." The 
mid 70's also brought us The 
Doors. Throw away the "greatest 
hits" and get "Strange Days" from 
1975. Like Janis. Morrison had the 
blues, and it killed him also Any 
Doors is good, but 1 love "Days." 
Don't forget Bob Dylan's "Blonde 
on Blonde" or "Highway 61 
Revisited," these are classics. 

If you like Aerosmith, you have 
to own "Rocks." because it does 
just that. "Back in the Saddle" and 
"Last Child" highlight this 1976 
release from these Boston rockers 
Any Aerosmith after 1981 just 
doesn't work in my opinion Also 
in 1976, Peter Tosh's "Legalize It." 
Tosh was murdered a few years 
later for his political views This 
album blows by anything Marley 
ever did, no offense to Bob of 
course. In 1977, Pink Floyd 
released "Animals" based on 
Orwell's book "Animal Farm." we 
all read in high school, You have to 
be in the mood for Floyd, but man. 
they did it right. This album mel- 
lows you out. then kicks your butt, 
great lyrics too. a Floyd trademark 
Also in the 70's, a posthumous 
release of Jimi Hendrix out-takes 



called Crash Landing." Actually, 
any thing from Hcndrix is good, 
especially "Are You 
Experienced?," the first album they 
ever did. 

The late 70's and early 80's 
gave us the Talking Heads and 
other progressive rock groups like 
Devo and the B-52's "Fear of 
Music" from the Heads and "Wild 
Planet" from the B-52's are must- 
haves in your collection. These 
bands were so ahead of their time 
Listen to these group's releases and 
you'll see where todays "alterna- 
tive rock" borrowed. Also the 
group X, from LA. put out "Wild 
Gift" in 1981. If you like "modem 
rock," buy it today Also REM's 
"Murmur" came out when I was a 
senior, so it has sentimental memo- 
ries, but it's still their best. Still 
wanna rock? The Scorpions 
"Blackout" makes Me tallica look 
like a Christian band. Sonic Youth's 
"Daydream Nation," came out over 
ten years ago! Sonic Youth doesn't 
gel any air time on mainstream sta- 
tions, but they are such an awesome 
band I can't describe their sound 
because ihey don't sound like any- 
one. That is what is so great about 
them, they are original

Career services will be 

sponsoring its 

Eighteenth Annual 

Job Fair 

on Thursday, 

March 19, 1998, 

from 10am-2pm in 

the Walb Ballroom. 

We have invited 
representatives from 

businesses and 

industry in the NE 

Indiana area to interview 

IPFW students for 

summer jobs. 




The Student Activities 
Board (SAB) would like to 
thank the Black Collegian

Phi for contributing their 

time, effort and talents to 

make the January 3 1 , Kids'

I think at least one employee in 
every business should know sign 
language. It's not just die deaf per- 
son's responsibility to try and speak 
to a hearing person It is also the 
heanng person who should try to 
leam another way to communicate. 

Furthermore, some instructions 
on games and writing on menus are 
written in one or more foreign lan- 
guages in addition to English, so 



are tons more and, of course, your 
tastes will change. These are 
albums you can always go back to 
no matter how old you are. At least 
try diem out. Today's music just 
doesn't cut it in my book 
Overproduced, overplayed, and 
video, has, in my humble opinion, 
made it less attractive to purchase 
the newer anisls spewing out their 
tndlionaire angst. 

LOSER OF THE WEEK- The 
President of the United States Did 
he or didn't be? He said, she said. 
Haven't we done this a couple of 
times already? Who cares, let the 
guy run the country. Quit trying to 
defend yourself Bill I'll tell you 
who has got to feel bad. Hillary 
What a trooper Think about what 
she must be thinking 1 certainly 
hope he didn't, and if he did, and he 
gels impeached, Al Gore will run 
the country. Think about that for a 
while. 



why not Braille? 

There needs to be a backup sys- 
tem for all elevators. If there would 
happen to be a fire in a building. 
with more than one floor and an ele- 
vator, how would someone in a 
wheelchair get out? 

The elevators by law must be 
shut down in such a situation. Who 
would take responsibility for those 
trapped inside? 

If you have not lived with a dis- 
ability for more tban a couple days, 
knowing you can't just ignore it, 
you have no idea what it's like to 
have a disability. You don't under- 
stand what it feels like to be carried 
upstairs, or helped into a public 
restroom, or what it's like trying to 
communicate with someone who 
doesn't understand "your lan- 
guage." 



Ignorance is no longer a legiti- 
mate excuse There are people who 
know and who are willing to share 
their knowledge. 

We are people first! All of us 
want to be loved, independent and 
successful We want, need and 
deserve a fair chance to make posi- 
tive contributions to society — the 
chance that our Constitution enudes 
all of us to. 

We didn't ask for our disabili- 
ties But we definitely do not need 
or want your pity! To many of us, 
our disabdities are a challenge, not 
a defeat! 

I admit a lot of changes have 
occurred in the area of accessibility 
and therefore probably in attitudes 
too, but there is still a long way to 
go-

By Nol Beckley

According to Hoyle, these are the top 10 rea- 
sons I haven't written a column since August: 

10. Tired of all the media hysteria that seems to 
accompany anything controversial that I write. 

9. Would rather devote my time to more enlight- 
ening and educational endeavors like professional 
wrestling or South Park. 

8. I don't have a damn features editor yet. 

7. Nothing has pissed me off too much this year 
because I'm graduating in May. BITE me under- 
classmen! 

6. All the really good homosexual topics were 
taken by a previous editor. 

5. Would rather spend my free time thinking up 
new ways to exact revenge on my exes. 

4. The sobering thought that this paper will con- 
tinue without my not-so-brilliant leadership. 

3. Actually having to go to my classes this semes- 
ter. 

2. I like seeing my name in print in papers other 
than The Communicator, no offense. 

And the number one reason I haven't written a 
column since August is . . . 
1 . I am still depressed about the Browns leaving 
Cleveland.

THE RUSTY CHLOE'S GENERATIONS 
BLADEN DINER 
BAND 



National Freedom Day, Valentines Day, 
Washington's birthday, Lincoln's birthday, 
and Groundhog Day. . . with King of the Weathei 
Prophets, Punxsutawney Phil, February is undoubtedly an exciting month, 
always has been. So why has February been named National Blah Buster 
Month? We can't explain it, we're only here to help. To provide comfort to all 
who suffer the Winter Blahs. To uplift their spirits with the reminder that 
spring soon will be ushered in. 

With a Different Blah Bustin' Band Every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday 
Ya' just can't go wrong. 

Thanks from everyone at Columbia Street. Enjoy our club and always 
remember to drink responsibly.
