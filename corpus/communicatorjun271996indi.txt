Walb space creates conflict 

Student organizations appeal room assignments 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 

News Editor and 

Paul Tupper 

Editor 

Space is an issue on any campus 
bousing over 70 siudent organiza- 
tions. Bui for IPFW student organi- 
zations, ihe issue has become a bai- 
lie 

The Space Allocation Review 
Board recently assigned suites 
within Walb Memorial Union. This 
is the first year such guidelines 
were put in writing. 

The available space in question 
is located in suites 210 and 214. 
The rooms consist of small cubicles 
that are divided iimong numerous 
siudenl organizations. With the 
exception of a few, the areas lack 
privacy and are small, but their 
location makes them invaluable to 
many. Various groups tend to use 
the area simply in socialize, while 
others take advantage of the space 




to carry serious meetings. 

While some groups were pleased 
with the assignments, others debat- 
ed wheUicr the decisions were just 
and fair Many students feel the 
board did not assign the areas 
according to need by showing 
favoritism towards fraternities. 

"Students don't know what their 
rights are," said IPSGA President 
George Gounaris, who is active in a 
fraternity "They take the space 
they can gel " Gounaris has been 
criticized by fellow fraternity mem- 
bers for his stance 



Under Ihe current allocations, 
many fraternities received spacious 
lounging areas which traditionally 
have been awarded to them. Frank 
Borelli. vice chancellor of student 
affairs, explained the methodology 
io this is a matter of legacy. 

"The social Greeks have a 
unique hisiory on this campus." 
says Borelli 

Kim Jacobs, director of studenl 
activities, adds the fraternities have 
earned their place in campus soci- 
ety. "They contribute as much as 
any other group." said Jacobs. "I 
agree the fraternities are a viable 
part of the campus." 

The Space Allocation Review 
Board was composed of five stu- 
dent members and one staff adviser, 
this year filled by Jacobs Students 
consisted of group members who 
were applying for office space, 
members who already had a space 
promised and members of the 
Greek Council The board reviewed 



many applications and assigned the 
organizations to areas they felt 
appropriate 

Borelli thinks the guidelines are 
a step in a right direction "The 
guidelines arc the most straightfor- 
ward and objective method for 
assigning the rooms," said Borelli 
"The guidelines were created with 
the students " 

Questioning the administration's 
procedures, Gounaris said. "The 
administration is not doing any- 
thing to solve die problem, so orga- 
nizations arc appealing." 

As a result of the space distribu- 
tion decision, several organizations 
have decided to appeal and request 
larger, more private areas. 

United Sexualilies (US) is one of 
many organizations that utilizes the 
space that has been offered to them 
Due to the need for membership 
confidentiality, the organization, 
designed to support students of var- 
ious sexual orientations, feels it 



'Dolly' takes the stage 

Popular production reunites actors 



by Jeremy bxxnbarger 
News Editor 



Neither Carol Cbanning nor 
Barbra Streisand will preform, yet 
Williams Theatre intends to make 
its production of "Hello, Dolly" a 
musical many will remember 

"There is not one song that audi- 
ences will not want to sing along 
with; not one pan will people will 
not feel like tapping their feet to." 
said director/choreographer Larry 
Life. 

"Hello, Dolly" is a show based 
on the premise that there is a spe- 
cial someone for everyone. Il tells 
the story of a local matchmaker 
named Dolly Gallagher Levi, who 
tries hard to find love for her sur- 
rounding residents. Within her 
meddling ways, she discovers thai 
even though iwo people can be 
almost complete opposites. they 
somehow fit together perfectly 
Through its moments of laughter, 
romance and close encounters, it is 
a production that many audiences 
have seen and adored. 

Based on Thornton Wilder's 
straight farce. "The Matchmaker," 
"Hello, Dolly" bad the longest run 
of any American musical for its 
time. It ran on Broadway from 
early 1964 to the end of 1970. 

"It's the biggesl show we've 
ever done," said Life, who directs a 
cast of over 50. 

To add to the excitement, two 
community guest artists have come 
to lend their talents for the pans of 
Dolly and Vandergelder Carol 




Carol Wasson and Kirby Voltz reunite for "Hello, Dolly. " This is IPFWs largest production to date 



Wasson will play the role of the 
effervescent matchmaker, while 
Kirby Voltz will portray the balky 
hay-graio-and -feel merchant in 
Yonkers, New York, whom Dolly 
secretly plans to marry For the 
two performers, it is a reunion, for 
they have worked together in van- 
ous shows at the University of 
South Dakota Voltz enjoys Ibe 
opportunity to act with Wasson 

"It's nice to work with Carol 
again." said Voltz. "And it's 
always a terrific experience to work 



with Larry Life." 

The main title "Hello, Dolly" 
remains being the song with the 
most popularity. Yet, satirical 
melodies like "Dancing" and 
"Elegance" give it some close com- 
petition And "Ribbons Down my 
Back" and "It Only Takes a 
Moment" blend in io prove every 
story has Us serious side. Whatever 
ibe mood brings, "Hello, Dolly" 
will be entertaining for many 

Tickets are on sale now at the 
IPFW Williams Theatre box office, 
219-481-6555. or can be charged 



by phone by calling TicketMaster,

needs a private room to secure the 
members identities The group is 
appealing the room assignment and 
is requesting a room with locked 
doors. 

In ihe appeal. US stated. 
"Privacy is our largest concern. 
United Sexualilies feel that over- 
heard conversations may devastate 
the lives of our members." 

Within the space allocation 
guidelines, it states that space is 
given "based solely on need and 
contribution to the university com- 
munity." A US spokesperson said 
by offenng lectures and continually 
asking for student involvement, the 
group fulfills the university's 
requirement for community contri- 
butions. 

"We put up at least 75 flyers a 
week, and to show we are discrimi- 
nated against and need the lockable 
doors, every week over 50 percent 
of them are either tore down or van- 
dalized," said a member of US. 



who requested to have his name 
withbeld. He said US has a mailing 
listofover5.000. 

According to Jacobs, security 
was an issue for all eleven groups 
requesting special rooms "Some 
groups feared safely and security of 
identity, others were concerned 
about valuable equipment." Jacobs 
said the safety issue is not 
addressed in the guidelines. 

"Those are legitimate concerns," 
said Borelli, "especially regarding 
hardware." 

To appeal the room allocations, 
a written statement detailing which 
of the guidelines were not met must 
be turned in within 10 days of noti- 
fication of the room assignments. 
Tbc appeal is then reviewed by the 
Appeals Board, which consists of 
Marian Zimmerman, dean of stu- 
dents, and Borelli. If a decision 
cannot be made, Jacobs is then 
called in to make a decision Dates 
have noi been set for appeals. 



Course showcases 
Hollywood's women 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

This summer, the stars are noi 
just in the skies, they arc a course 
offered as an off-campus credit 
program But you don't need a 
microscope to study these stars, 
just some popcorn 

"Hollywood's Leading Ladies" 
takes students on a cinematic voy- 
age through 10 films starring leg- 
endary women, including Marilyn 
Monroe, Katherine Hepburn and 
Carole Lombard The class, which 
can be taken for undergraduate or 
graduate credit, meets Tuesdays 
and Thursdays, 7-10:20 p.m , June 
25-August 1 Classes meet at the 
Cinema Center. 437 East Berry 
Street. 

"1 would highly recommend mis 
summer course." said Lawrence S 
Friedman, professor of English and 
linguistics. "It's really simple fun" 

Films viewed in (be course 
range from "20lh Century" and 
"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" to die 
more recent "The French 
Lieutenant's Woman," while the 
women stamng in them come from 
years of Hollywood magic. 
Experienced stars like Mae West 
are joined by latter-day dramatic 
actresses like Diane Keaton. It not 
only concentrates on the improve- 



ment of women's roles in film, it 
also looks at the progress the whole 
entertainment field has made 

"Hollywood's Leading Ladies" 
offers many advantages, including 
the enjoyment some will get from 
observing classic films Many stu- 
dents will appreciate that there are 
no books required; most of the 
information is offered from the 
films themselves. Though some 
work is needed, the amount of out- 
side work is cut to a minimum. 
Plus, most of the movies can be 
found on video if an absence is 
necessary Bui some will say the 
pure essence of ibe class is to 
watch Ihem on the "big screen." 

"The books don't exist, there- 
fore there are no book fees," said 
Friedman "The class is a give- 
away." 

The course is being offered 
through Ihe English Department as 
not ooly an educational experience 
but also as a type of community 
service. It is meani to encourage 
Fort Wayne residents to continue 
their education. 

As always, early registration is 
recommended, but not a must. 
"People can still get into the class 
to the very end," says Friedman.

ister, call IPFW Off-Campus Credit 
Programs, 219-481-6172.

MOOTC WTH 'TWHPOUHE' 



by KHs Bard 
Special lo the 
Communicator 

On June 30. 
Fori Wayne's 
War Memorial 
Coliseum will be 
filled with dial- 
ed concert-goers 
waiting to see 
tbe alternative 
group Seven 
Mary Tbree. 
However, before 
tbe main act 
comes on stage, 
a name not so 
well known to 
the general pub- 
lic will be open- 
ing. 

H i s 
name is Joe 
Henry and he is 
jumping off to a 
new start with 
bis latest album 
"Trampoline ." 
Though this is a 
new album and 
some of tbe first 
mainstream 

exposure tbai tbe artist has had. this 
is bis sixth CD lo be released. 
Henry recorded the majority of bis 
past CD's live and in small studios. 
According to Henry, as stated in a 
Rolling Stone interview, this was an 
eye-opening experience tbai per- 
haps prepared him for tbe long road 
of a music career 

A little 
known inter- 
fact 
about Henry 
is one Ibat 
includes a 
famous rela- 
tive by mar- 
riage — 
Madonna 
Though 




Joe Henry will entertain audiences at the War Memonal Coliseum on June 30 



sound is also added lo several 
tracks by Page Hamilion, a member 
of the group Pavement, who plays 
electric guitar. 

According to Rolling Stone. 
Henry has been said to move away 
from ibe old sound of rural rock and 
into a new urban groove. 

"The stylistic shifts make 




sing backup on one of his old cover 
songs "Guiliy By Association ." 

"I've been answering questions 
about her for so long," Henry said. 
"But I find it kind of a relief now. 
because now there's no reason to 
talk about her." 

For many years, Henry created 
music with a heavy, country-rock 
sound Yet with this new release be 
moves away from the twangy sound 
of CDs past and moves into a more 
electric sound. Henry accomplished 
bis desired sound by including a 
heavier bass line with a combina- 
tion of instruments ranging from 
electric guitars to banjos lo pipe 
organs A mellow yet industrial 



'Trampoline' Henry's most diverse 
and adventurous work," Rolling 
Stone said. 

Entertainment Weekly calls the 
new release "a scaringly honest and 
compelling album. A-." Such rave 
reviews must please this artist who 
bad just grown bored with bis old 
style of music and moved into ihis 
new sound that is now gelling some 
major attention. 

"Trampoline," a CD containing 



Photo by Jo Ann Callis 
nine (racks, is for the most part a 
very, very mellow compilation of 
poetic lyrics and instrumentation 
ibat is poetic in ils own right 

The odd combinations of varying 
vocal elements with different brass 
and siring arrangements are mixed 
into a smooth sound with some 
heavy bass riffs and tones A basi- 
cally slow lempo 
with clear lyrics 
adds lo the almost 
subdued mood of 
the music. The 
occasional country- 
rock influence can 
be heard in some 
tracks, bul for tbe 
mosi pan Henry's 
rougher voice, 
which sounds sort 
of like a combina- 
tion between Bob 
Dylan and Tom 
Petty in some 
instances, swings 
his type of sound 
into a more alterna- 
tive classification 

The combination 
of this slow, almost 
hypnotic type of 
music with the 
rougher and louder 
sound of Seven 
Mary Three should 
be interesting, yet the balance 
between Ibe two may be just 
enough lo keep ibe fans happy. As 
for tbe career of Joe Henry, this 
new beginning gives him a chance 
to be known on a much larger scale. 
He does not seem to be leaving ihe 
music scene anytime soon. As he 
says in the litle track, "This time 
I'm noi coming down.''

^■■^^ ^" Father reflects on benefits of open adoption 



by Amanda M anion 
Features Editor 

For Father's Day this year, 
Greg Feaster opened a card like 
many fathers across Ihe nation. 
Like the average fathers, be watch- 
es bis daughter 
Alexandria grov. 
and sees glimpses 
of himself in her 
from time to 
time. 

"When I'm 
watching ber 
play with blocks, 
she'll bile her lip or 
slick her tongue out 
when she concentrates. She 
definitely gets that from me." he 
says as he watches ibe summer 
rain fall 

Feaster' s relationship with his 
daughter is unique compared to the 
average father. Two and a half 
years ago. Feaster gave up his 
legal rights to his child in an open 
adoption. 

In open adoptions, the biologi- 
cal parents have tbe opportunity to 
choose the family in which their 
child will be placed. 

During his senior year of high 
school. Feaster fell in love. Tbe 
one time he and his girlfriend, both 
virgins, had sex. she became preg- 
nant. From thai point on, Feaster, 
ihen 17 years old. had some very 
adull decisions to make 

"The adoption made me grow 
up really really quickly," says 
Feaster. 

The pregnancy pui a tremen- 
dous emotional stress on his girl- 
friend, himself and both of iheir 
families, Feaster says From the 
very beginning though, bis family 
was supportive and pushed for the 



young couple lo keep tbe baby 

Feaster's girlfriend was in her 
first year of college and ber family 
wanted tbe baby put up for adop- 
tion. Abortion was never consid- 
ered as an option. The disagree- 
ment on wbal was best for the 
baby put a rift between the 
two families, Feasler 
says, and lakes a 
drag off his 
cigarette. 

Sitting 

back in his 

chair on the 

porch, Feaster 

looks like the 

'all-American 

boy next door" wilh his 

baseball cap and tanned skin 

Smoke curls in the air as be 

exhales 

There were times when (her] 
mom wouldn't talk to me." he 
says. 

Tbe decision lo place the child 



in the home of a couple that physi- 
cally could not have children 

"They're a good Christian fami- 
ly 1 couldn't find a belter home 
for her. The parents are very lov- 
ing and giving and want us to be 
so involved in Alexandria's life." 
says Feaster. 

Alexandria's adoptive parents 
encourage Feaster and his now ex- 
guifriend, with whom he is still 
besi friends, to visit ibeir 'daughter 
Tbe adoptive couple sends Feaster 
pictures and Feaster often baby- 
sits The open adoption enables 
them to keep certain ties lo iheir 
daughier. 

"I think as far as adoption, peo- 
ple should seriously consider open 
adoption. It helps a lot Seeing ber 
in pictures Seeing how she's 
growing. Having the courtesy of 
being able to go over there and 
visit her," says Feaster 

Looking back on tbe adoption, 

Feaster realizes many ihings. He 

in an adoptive home really came says lhai tbe adoption brought turn 




down to Feasier's girlfriend, who 
was legally of age 

"When you're under 18. the 
government says that you're still 
a kid I couldn't do any 
thing legally," 
Feaster says. 

The decision 
to place the child 
for adoption was 
made and 

Feasler and his 
girlfriend 
looked at a few 
different families in 
which to place (heir 
baby. Later. Feaster

adoption has parity shaped who be

"It made me grow up so 
much But adoption didn't

was a mature deci- 
sion." says

Commentary 



Alumna issues call to save our earth 



by Christine Beauchoi 
Guest Columnist 

OK — So you've done your part to clean up 
the environment right? Recycled a few cans? 
Switched from aerosols to pumps? Bought an 
environmental license plate 1 Well guess what 
There's more toil than thai. 

When most people think of environmental 
problems they blame them on big corporations 
such as Exxon and the infamous Valdez oil spill 
or big factories and their ever-polluting smoke 
slacks Surprisingly, household chemicals have 
given us. the consumers, the honor of being the 
second highest polluters in the world 

Anything that goes down our drains is flushed 
out into our water systems. These chemicals 
don't just go down that litdc bole and disappear, 
they eventually end up in our oceans and our 



drinking water You're probably saying that you 
are not one of those environmentally clueless 
people who dump their leftover oil and sewage 
down the drain You even may make special 
trips to designated dump sites to get rid of your 
household waste don't you. Well good for you, 
but wait. ..did you wash your bair today? Wbat 
did you clean your sinks and cars with this week- 
end? How about when you washed your clothes, 
did the dishes or simply washed your bands? 
Each of these activities requires the use of some 
form of chemically created cleaning solution All 
of those chemicals go right down the drain 
Obviously, these are all necessary routines and 
we can't stop taking showers and cleaning our 
homes so the only solution is to switch to all nat- 
ural, biodegradable replacements 

1 know what you're thinking, "It's bard 
enough deciding between paper or plastic let 



alone which brand of environmentally safe 
cleaning products to use." but it's not all that dif- 
ficult. Tbe solution may be right under your 
nose There are many companies and organiza- 
tions out there working together to make this a 
healthier, safer planet If you want to find out 
more about bow you can free your home of dan- 
gerous chemicals and do your part to clean up 
our earth, call me at 484-3148 or 484-5368 

We have a lot of work to do before this earth 
is a healthy place to live again But we'll never 
get there if we don't lake the first step The 
choice you make today could mean the differ- 
ence between a place for our children to live or a 
place for life to end. There's no room for pro- 
crastination and laziness — we're running out of 
time. Call today!

Define yourself, quit 
worrying about other 
peoples lives 




Recently a fnend and I went 
to see a movie which did 
feature some minor homo- 
sexual scenes. I won't mention the 
movie because it was truly pathet- 
ic — it was not wbat I expected 
from a group of "Kids" which usu- 
ally make me laugh my tail off. 

Knowing the style of humor of 
this comedy troupe, I knew what to 
expect. But there were two gende- 
men who sat in the row in front of 
us who could not deal with the fact 
that there was a man watching gay 
porn on the screen They even 
showed the man's butt (gasp!) Both 
of these men uttered a few anti- 
homosexual comments that surpris- 
ingly I won't print 

I did not find n repulsive to see 
a man's button the big screen. If it 
would have been hairy and pimply 
1 would have objected lo the shot 
for aesthetic reasons 

1 piued these men and their lack 
of understanding for a culture 
which differs from their own. 
Much in the way I pity the people 
at 1PFW who feel this divine need 
to rip down ibe signs which adver- 
tise United Sexuahties I'm not sur- 
prised (After all we do live in the 
Bible Belt), but I am concerned 



with tbe lack 

of depth or 

security these 

lllIM 1 people have in 

w; , , their own sex- 

Beckley ua i !de nuiy. 

Myself. 

I could care 

. &lt;SToW tO%. less about who 

anyone thinks 

t&amp;e tHo,c6 ' slee P wluV l 

doubt loo 
many people 
out there do 
care. But to 
some people, whether you are a 
decent person depends on whether 
you like to butter your toast on one 
side or the other (or even both 
sides). 

Don't people have enough faith 
in their own sexual urges that they 
would decline an advance from a 
homosexual. It may even be some- 
what flattering to be approached. 
Think of it this way — you have 
fans from both teams. Kind of like 
Cal Ripken — wherever he plays be 
is respected. Tbe fans in Yankee 
Stadium do not care whether be 
plays for Baltimore — they still 
think tbe world of him. 

I'm still amazed that at a college 
campus, some people are about as 
deep as a kiddie pool. 

It is still ridiculous that we live 
in a world where we must have 
something to hate openly. 
Unfortunately, that "honor" is 
given to homosexuals Openly hat- 
ing African-Americans has become 
a social taboo This doesn't mean 
that in certain segments of America 
racism has died, it just means that 
racism is limited to a few select 
groups, like the LAPD But that is 
a different story. 



Disney courts gay lovers 

i 



have 
never 




sited 
any of the 
Walt Disney 
theme parks. 
But when I 
heard the 
company 
extended ben- 
efits lo part- 
ners of gay 
employees, I 
knew one day 
I would visit 
the parks with pride. 

It is comforting to know the 
world's leading distributor of fami- 
ly entertainment recognizes gays, 
the gay dollar and gay family val- 
ues. We haven't seen gay cartoon 
characters yet — no Mickey's high 
pitched voice and school boy fash- 
ion does not count — but we've 
made progress in the right direc- 
tion. 

The Southern Baptists' boycott 
of Disney, for me. is welcomed 
Disney may lose a little money, but 
I will feel more comfortable at a 
theme park where 1 am accepted. 
Knowing the Southern Baptists do 
not accept gays ensures I will have 
a hassle-free good time. Since this 
issue has been made so public, only 
those who are tolerant of gays wilt 
patronize the park, and if I'm going 
to be there, that's One by me 

The Southern Baptists decision 
has made many curious It doesn't 
agree with Disney's offering of 
benefits to gay partners of employ- 
ees. A statement by Disney, and 
one with which I totally agree, 
slammed the Southern Baptists for 
encouraging the denial of health 
care to anyone In this age of chaot- 
ic health care issues, why would 
anyone associated with an organi- 
zation claiming to possess religious 
morals not want to see someone 
protected by health insurance? 

Criticism by tbe Southern 
Baptists is also aimed at gay- 



Paul 
Tupper 



themed days held at the park. 
Disney, however, does not sponsor 
such days. "Gay Day," whether 
held at Disney World or Kings 
Island or Cedar Point, is organized 
by gays on their own Word of 
mouth and tradition have made 
such events popular for years Tbe 
parks have nothing to do with our 
showing up collectively. 

I have been to such gay days 
without incident. I've seen big, 
burly rednecks try to look cool by 
making jokes like, "How many fag- 
gots does it take to ride a roller 
coaster?" only to be surrounded by 
40 gays ready to defend their rights 
to be at the park without the fear of 
being bashed. I saw a little girl ask 
her parents why two women were 
holding bands, only to bear her 
mother answer, "Well honey, 
because some people are different." 
The mother's non-chalantness was 
nice to see. and proves gay days at 
parks do not just benefit gay peo- 
ple. Who knows bow this little 
girl's interactions with gays would 
have been handled under different 
circumstances. 

Disney has proven to be a true 
friend to gays. It has publicly stood 
by our side during the Southern 
Baptists attack I bet tbe company 
will not lose much money because 
of this. On the contrary — Disney 
has sent a clear message it wants 
our dollar And for sucb support, 
we shall give it.

Baseball brass sends a twisted message 




Hypocritical, spineless and self- 
serving are all words that came to 
riiinil wben trying to describe the 
current state of affairs in Major 
League Baseball After effectively 
ostracizing Marge Scbott from the 



from f/? 



game for her 
"unbecoming 
behavior." the 
league brass 
have reneged 
on their obliga- 
tion to repri- 

Cleveland's 
Albert Belle. In 
a clear case of 
double stan- 
dards. Bud 
Selig. the act- 
ing commis- 
sioner, and his friends have served 
notice lo Scholl that she is no 
longer welcome in the game, while 
baby-sitting Belle 

You might recall the latest ma- 



rom rne wire. 



dent involving the hothead Belle 
After sending Milwaukee second 
baseman Fernando Vina flying 
across the diamond with a deliber- 
ate forearm shiver to the throat. 
Belle was suspended for five 
games. He appealed the punish- 
ment The sentence was reduced to 
three games and Belle was still not 
willing to accept tbe sentence. With 
the belp of his agent and an execu- 
tive from the Player's Association, 
Belle appealed once again and tbe 
sentence was reduced once again It 
was finally sealed that Belle was to 
miss two days of action, to be 
served during a double header 

The backlash is amazing, if not 
disgusting Tbe league's reasoning 
for reducing Belle's punishment is 



JQ_f 



(bat no action (throwing him from 
the game) was taken by the umpires 
at the time of the incident It is 
il logical and incomprehensible One 
level of enforcement fails, so anoth- 
er, higher level cannot act? What 
message is this sending to players 
as well as fans? 

The illogical, unfocused prob- 
lems of baseball continue to mysti- 
fy even the most learned fans. Not 
to mention the effect upon the 
younger fans who hunger for role 
models And everyone has been so 
concerned about the bad image por- 
trayed by Dennis Rodman. 

As much as Belle's oui-of-con- 
trol behavior hurts tbe image of 
baseball, the limp-wristed and 
flawed judgments of league offi- 



cials hurls it more. Belle's com- 
ments border on absurd, bis actions 
on disgust If people continue 
telling him be is right, one of these 
days something is going to happen, 
either on or off the baseball field, 
that is loo much for the game and 
society to handle 

So while Scbott whiles away be? 
time in what may evolve into a life- 
long ban from the game. Belle is 
allowed to continue playing despite 
the vileness of his actions If it 
weren't so sickening it might be 
humorous. If Belle and Schott were 
everyday, ordinary citizens, would 
the situations be reversed, would 
we ignore Scbott as a crazy, loud- 
mouthed, old lady and possibly 
impose the deserved sentence upon 



Belle? 

Incidentally, in an odd twist of 
comparison, ii becomes even more 
clear just bow light Belle's punish- 
ment has become Wben Algeria 
lost a World Cup soccer qualifica- 
tions match to Kenya, all hell broke 
loose. Tbe Algerians promptly 
banned the coacb for lift, dissolved 
the national soccer federation and 
disbanded the national soccer 
league. "Bad Albert" should be 
counting his blessings be bves and 
plays in the United States! 

Take it as you will Just remem- 
ber, tbe view from under the 
bleachers is rarely attractive and it's 
never fair. 



A party of five- 
Corey Parker, first baseman for 
the Bangor Blue O* of the minor 
league Northeast League, had a 
career night last week. In a double 
header against Rhode Island. 
Parker hit rive home runs in five 
consecutive at bats 

After opening the first game 
with a single, Parker ripped a borne 
run in each of bis next four at bats 
He finished the game with 10 RBI 
and four runs scored In tbe night- 
cap. Parker homered in his first at 
bat to make it five dingers in five 
consecubve plate appearances.

defending its bile late last week by 
re-signing coacb Pbil Jackson, 
Terms of the agreement were not 
disclosed but it is rumored the one- 
year deal is worth nearly S2-5 mil- 
lion. Jackson bad been asking for 
S3 million for next season, after 
making a minuscule $800,000 dur- 
ing tbe Bulls title run last season 

Jackson was named the league's 
Coacb of the Year after guiding 
Chicago to the best-ever regular 
season record in NBA history and 
a fourth title in sin years. He bad 
threatened to take a year-long sab- 
batical from coaching if Bulls 
management could not come up 
with an acceptable offer. 

Bulls management must now 
concentrate on signing tbe nucleus 
of the team that set the precedent 
for greatness last season Team 
leaders Micbael Jordan and 
Dennis Rodman both become free

seeking a deal worth S20 million

Basketball camps stress the fundamentals 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

Standing before SO kids ranging 
in age from 6 to 15. new men's bas- 
ketball coach John Williams gives 
instruction on the proper techniques 
of shooting a basketball 

Proper alignment, follow through 
and repetition arc the three things 
be continues preaching to the 
group With attentive eyes this crew 
of gym rats soak up ihe coach's 
instruction like (be sweat (bat 
drenches their shins 

"You always want to do the same 
thing every time you step up to the 
free-throw line." Williams said "Get 
your shoulders square to the basket 
and follow through " 

Wilbin minutes, the kids are out 
on the court practicing what 
Williams preached, in varying 
degrees of success 

It is all a part of this year's boys' 
basketball camp at the Gates Sports 
Center The idea is to drill the fun- 
damental techniques of the game at 
the campers until it becomes second 
nature to them As a coach at the 
collegiate level, Williams said his 
biggest pet peeve is players who 
don't play with the fundamentals of 
the game. 

"The most frustrating thing is 



when a kid can't use both hands (to 
dribble or shoot), " Williams said 
"We really need to get back to the 
fundamentals."

position camps Currendy, the con- 
centration is on the post and guard 
positions. 

Despite the concentration on 
positions. Bowden says the most 



important pan of the game is still 
fundamentals She also sees a lack 
of solid, all-around players. 

"People (coaches) aren't making 
them do it (concentrate on the 
things a player 
doesn't do 
well)." 
Bowden said. 
"We're look- 
ing for the all- 
around solid 
player" 

Williams 
cited the fact 
that a great 
number of the 
summer bas- 
ketball camp 
kids are 



exp 



to 



improper 
instruction and 
instead con- 
centrate on 
playing the 

game 

"Most 

summer camps 

are stressing the five-on-five 

game." Williams said. 'Kids don't 

learn anything that way " 

The goals of the camps, accord- 
ing to Williams and Bowden, are 
for every camper to leave with a 



heightened knowledge and grasp on 
the fundamentals of basketball 

"We hope that by the time they 
walk out of here they will feel like 
they are comfortable with the things 
we have taught them." Williams 
said "I'm looking for improvement 
and perfection of the basics In 
today's game, if you can't shoot 
and dribble with both hands you're 
going to stick out like a sore 
thumb" 

Bowden also sees the camp as a 
way of heightening the exposure of 
IPFW in the community and get 
people excited about the basketball 
programs 

"We want kids that are willing to 
work hard." Bowden said "I will 
take a kid that is going to work hard 
over a good athlete any time " 

Williams hopes that by slicking 
to the basic fundamentals of the 
game, the campers will leave with a 
better understanding and a better 
grasp of the game Basketball is a 
game of basic techniques that are 
carried out in a fashion that is better 
than the opponent At the end of 
this year's basketball camp, 
Williams hopes each one of the kids 
that attended will be able to work 
his own fundamentals to perfection 
as he gets belter at playing the 
game.

mon, but Ibe captain of the United

created bis own charitable organiza- 
tion in hopes of raising half a mil- 
lion dollars for underprivileged 



children. 

Ctvnlik created the "Give Back 
Foundation" and the unique pro- 
gram he calls the "spike-a-ihon," in 
an effort to raise pledges thai total 
55,000 for every spike he slams 
past the opponent during the 
Olympic Games. As a member of 
the 1988 gold medal Olympic team 
and the 1992 bronze medal team, 
Civrtlik averaged nearly 100 suc- 
cessful spikes at both games All of 
the money raised through the foun- 



dation will benefit disabled, abused 
and terminally ill children 

"I have been blessed in many 
ways." said Ctvnlik. "I feel that 
with the creation of the Give Back 
Foundation, I will be able to use my 
position wiihm the sporting com- 
munity to raise money and aware- 
ness to help ihe most precious 
resource we have, our children " 

In addition to thousands of well- 
wishing Olympic fans who have 
donated to the cause, corporate

of dollars worth of licensed mer- 
chandise for use as incentive gifts 
given in return for charitable dona- 
tions.

show that not every professional 
athlete is in search of money, glory 
and praise There arc sou" those ath- 
letes who embody the true meaning 



of the Olympic Games
