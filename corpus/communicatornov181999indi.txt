Albee also expressed concern for the 
current state of theater. "The commercial 
theater is in serious trouble," said Albee. 
He went on to discuss the concept that

Wiihin the past four or five 
months, talk has emerged that 
all of the athletic teams at IPFW

team is the only learn at IPBV

competition for college athletics. 

Bowman and Walt Branson,

Bring cheer to a stranger 



by, Nathan Erlcson. Staff Writer 

About this time last year, I 
was working at a store In the 
mall. I really enjoyed It. I had 
never worked in retail before. (I 
am a referee by trade, so any- 
thing other than getting yelled 
and screamed at was a wonder- 
ful changel). I liked the store I 
worked at, especially because it 
lold outdoor gear and 1 love lo 
camp and hike. 1 really 
enjoyed helping people find 
what they wanted. I also 
enjoyed helping those few peo- 
ple who had no Idea what they 
wanted find something that I 
knew would work for them. 1 
was a good salesman: not the 
best, but certainly one of the 
best in the chain of stores. In 
the five shori months that 1 
worked there, I developed a 
clientele that consistcndy came 
In to see me and ask mc for 
help. 

These people didn't come 
In to see me just because I was 
a good salesman, but because I 
was polite and courteous. How 
many times do we as shoppers 
go into a store to buy some- 
thing, but the salespeople 
hound us, so we leave? I went 
looking for a desk the other 
day with my mom and the 
salesperson followed us for 
about 100 yards, hollered at us 
and then told us her name 
about sLv times In the span of a 
minute. No c.\aggcration here. 



builder's supply store, two. as a 
matter of fact, and it was not 
the salespeople that were rude, 

department. I was trying to find 
a rebate form and the guys In 
the area where 1 was looking 

forms were. They directed mc 
very politely to Customer 
Service. Customer Service was 
not io polite. 1 was Ignored for 
a good three minutes and then 
after about five minutes of ban- 
tering for Just a rebate form, 1 
was referred back to the 
department I had just left. It 
turned out that there had been 
a mistake and they had no 
rebate forms, so I went back 
later in the week. When I 
returned, I was Ignored again. 
This lime it was ver&gt;' blatant. 
Not even a. "One moment, sir." 
I left and returned with my 
purchases and got a refund. 

I came across a quote the 
other day that said, "The per- 
son who does things that count 
doesn't usually stop to count 
them." Think about this for a 
moment. It's quite profound if 
you ask me. The person who 
does things In life that are ben- 
eficial, that means something in 
someone else's life, does not do 
them for an e.vterlor praise, but 



for the satisfaction of one's self. 
When 1 sold camping gear, it 
was not to get the big sale 
(although this sometimes was a 
reward), but to make the cus- 
tomer happy with his or her 
purchases. I excelled because I 
did not pressure customers, but 
instead proposed ideas. 

I would challenge everyone 
who reads this to do one help- 
ful thing each day. One thing Is 
not hard to do and on this cam- 
pus. It is even easier. Hold the 
door for someone. You could 
even push those little blue 
handicapped entry squares and 
surprise the person In front of 
you when they start to open the 
door. Another thing is to just 
smile at someone as they walk 
across campus. Say hi to profes- 
sors as they walk by or even 
give them a call and tell them 
that you really enjojed class or 
that you will not be attending 

(This Is good for brownie points 
as welt, but don't make it too 
obvious.) 

There is so much that one 
can do to lift someone else up 
during the course of a day. It 
does not take too much lime 
and who knows, someday the 
kindness may be returned to 
you. What's Ihat age-old say- 
ing? Oh yeah,.. The GOldcn 
Rule... Do unto others as you 
would want done unto you.

This pasi Monday, the 
Supreme Court decided the) 

regarding prajer and school. 

testing whether or not stu- 
dents are allowed to pray at 
football games. 

Apparently, a Galveston, 
Te\as, school board had a 
policy allowine students to 
participate in student-led 
group prayers at their foot- 
ball games. However, a court 
ruling struck down that poli- 
cy, saying it violated the 
"separation of church and 
state" set forth in the 

Supreme Court wants to hear 
the case next June, making it 
the first "school prayer" case 
of the new millennium. 

Personally. I'm glad the 
Supreme Court decided to 
step into the matter because 
I'm getting tired of people 
blowing things like praying 
in school out of proportion. I 
hardly see praying In school 
as advocating a state-spon- 
sored religion. This Is anoth- 
er fine example of people 
misinterpreting the reason 
why a law Is made a law. 

The original intent of 
separating church and state 
was to avoid situations like 
the one In England, where 
only one religion was legal at 
"he time of the framing of 
lur Constitution. Since many 
of the people who originally 
ramc here were people seck- 
ng religious freedom and 
ijnce there were so many dif- 
ferent religions being prac- 
ticed at the lime the 
Constitution was created, the 
Constitution would have tost 

public support had It 
placed restrictions on. what 
religion people practiced. 
Just as it would now. Doesn't 



:hanges. We are pleased to 
see so much change occur- 
ring in our school, especially 
since all of these changes are 
for the better. The better our 
school looks, the better we 
feel about going here. 

Even the handful of neg- 
ative things that have 
occurred on campus rccenUy 
which make many question 
why they chose IPFW In the 
first place haven't been too 
terrible. Perhaps one thing 
Ihat stands out the most is 
the bomb threats. Despite the 
annoyance of missing class 
and having to make up a lot 
of work (or even having to 
have class in a less-than-suit- 
able location for the day), we 
believe that students at IPFW 
were verj lucky that these 
were just threats and thai no 
serious damage was done. 
That in itself Is cause to be 
thankful. 

Students should also be 
thankful that there is a gootl 
posslblllij' of dorms becom- 
ing a reallt)' in the next few 
years, changing the "com- 
muter campus" image that 
IPFW has struggled under 
since its .creailon.' There is, 



pray 



keeping people from turning 
to iheir god whenever they 
need to, though, place similar 
restrictions on the practice of 
religion? 

I don'i think prayer in 
school should be mandator)' 
□r sponsored by the school, 
but I also don't believe that 
students who wish to pray to 
their god should be forbid- 
den from doing so, cspectall)' 
in a high-stress environment 
like school. To me. I would 
really rather see someone 
praying than taking out 
stress in other ways, such as 
fighting or swearing. 

I also think that if stu- 
dents were given the option 
of praying, those that feel 
Isolated or pressured by their 
peers to fit in would have 

selves and wouldn't feel as 
pressured to give In. They 
wouldn't feel as alone if they 
were able to talk to someone 
(or something) who isn't as 
quick to judge as teenagers 
often times can be. 

Unfortunately, peer 
pressure Is at the core of the 
argument of those who wish 
to see student-led praying 
banned from football games. 
The families who successfully 
lobbied against the school 
district's policy are spear- 
heading the movement to 
have the Supreme Court 
reject the school district's 
appeal, despite support for 
the appeal coming from nine 
states in friend-of-the-couri 
briefs. 

The families have 
charged all along that even 
though it Is students and not 
facult)- or clergy leading the 
prayer, the pressure to con- 
form is still strong. In fact, 
the)- say It may even be 
stronger coming from their

IPFW continues to grow. Our

Take time for yourself 



by Kathy Delagrange, Nevirs Editor 



With the holiday season 
upon us, I have noticed that 
people seem to be 'running 
around" at an Increasingly 
faster rate. I have heard 
numerous people complain 
about how rushed and 
stressed out they arc feeling. 
Unfortunately. 1 too. have 
been feeling that way recently. 

When I was younger, it 
seemed like the time from 
November Tirst to December 
25 was the longest period of 
time in the entire year. Of 
course, with limited responsi- 
bilities, I didn't really have 
much to worry about. Now, I 

attend school full-time and 
have a fairly long list of oblig- 
ations that I have to fulfill. 

Although I keep myself 
busy by choice and often over- 
extend myself, I typically 
don't feel 'stressed out." 
However, every once In a 
while, that uneasy feeling of 
being pulled in too many 
directions does creep Into the 
pit of my stomach and I some- 
times begin to feel over- 
whelmed.

de-stress myself fairly easily 
by making a list of everything 
that I absolutely must do and

as much done as I can and I

I've noticed that some 
people can be reallj high- 
strung and anal about keeping 
things exactly on schedule. 
Being in the medical profes- 
sion and working on a labor 
and deli^eiy unit in a hospital, 
I have learned that things

Behind the scenes at the theatre department 



by Mlshanna Wood, 
Managing Edlor 



For some or us, a visit lo the local 
Saturday night performance ai IPFW's 
Williaim Theatre It a time to gel involved 
with what l! going on onstaRe and to be 
entertained. As one of the performing 
arts, theatre production involves the 
artistic talents of many individuals, for 
these people, the Saturday performances 
onstage are the result of many hours put 
into rehearsing, directing, building and 
designing. 

Theatre members have to work 
together in order to convey the vision, 
message and point of view of the play- 
wright. The director is responsible for 
the focus or vision of the play. This per- 
son hds the final word on everything that 
occurs In a production. In general, all of 
these artists have to create a willing suj- 
pcnslon of disbelief in the audience. In 
other words, the audience may be sitting 
in a theatre in 1999, but they need to be 
wllUng to tell themselves that they are in 
a differenl time period, in a different 
place. Being able to put oneself into a 
willing suspension of disbelief helps a 
person understand and get more 
involved with the theme of the play. 

Acting, making music, sounds, 
scener)', lighting and costumes are some 
of the pieces that help bring a theatre 
production together. According to Larrj' 
Ufe, chair and professor in tihe theatre 
department, it would take years to teach 
a penon alt of the different aspects that 
are involved with creating a piece. 



■Thei 



e thre 



s thai 



should be asked," according to B' 
Harwood, associate professor and light- 
ing designer in the Theatre Department, 
'What Is the theme, mood, time and 
place." Harwood designs scenery and 
specializes in lighdng design. All of these 
questions are asked when one Is prepar- 
ing to do anything related to the peifor- 

The persons iovoked with each area 
of a producdon usually have to do some 
degree of research in order to leotn the 
history or technical aspects In a play. 
The location, time period and structures 
of buildings are e.xamples of some parts 
of a production that must be researched. 
The amount of research necessary 



realistic the play needs to look. 

Harwood said that he had to work 
on a play in college that took place in 
New York. In New York, lights shine down 
on the city and reHect off of buildings. 
Pollution and srasons also have an effect 
on how the lights will appear. Harwood 
spoke to a friend from New York and 
looked at a photo essay of the citj . 
Harwood noted that there is a big differ- 
ence bettveen the lighting in Montana 
where his college was located and the 
lighting in New York, 

For lighting design and sjme 
scener}' design, Hanvood first reads a 
script ID gel a feel for iL He then reads 
the script a second time to lake notes on 
parts that stand oul Finally, he reads it a 
third time to get more pointed Ideas. 
Harwood will watch rehearsals to see 
where the characters stand and move on 
the stage. This helps him to coordinate 
the lights with the performance. Then 
diagrams are created so that he can pin- 
point the spot in which the character will 

The amount of light and the bright- 
ness of the lighting depend on the mood 
and the setting for the play. After the 
positioning and brightness of the lighting 
has been decided, the time in which the 
lighting changes Is programmed into a 
computer. The lighting coordination can 
be changed with the push of a button. 

"Lighting is woven Into the fabric of 
the show and is much more interactive 
than sccner&gt;'. It Is intriguing, energizing 
and much more immediate.' said 
Harwood. -It interacts with the charac- 
ters on stage. It can be the reacdon, stim- 
ulus or response of a character," 

Scenery is another important part of 
the performance. Harwood said that the 
age and style of architecture varies from 
one country, state or city to the next The 
demands of the play have to comply with 
the dme period. "Assassins." for oample, 
was an epic play. The setting was In 
many different locations and time peri- 
ods, therefore the scenery was composed 
of a little piece from each lime period. 
These criteria are standard for scenery as 
well as costumes. 

According to Craig Humphrey, asso- 
ciate professor of the theatre department 
and costume designer, the types of cos- 
tumes chosen for a performance come 
from the way the actor, the text and the 

demands of who the character is and the 



particular dme period chosen. 

"When the audience sees a charac- 
ter, they should know something about 
that character based on appearance.' 
said Humphrey, "The costume has to say 
something about the actor or actress. 
They are also designed according to the 
actions of the performer and the 
demands of the play." Humphrey said 
that fine details are not always needed 
because the audience cannot see them. 

Some costumes arc designed for 
quick changes. For example, the cos- 
tumes can be taken off by a pin or a but- 
ton and another one can be put on in a 
matter of minutes. Costumes that are 
worn in musicals have to go through a 
great deal of wear and tear and must be 
tailored accordingly. Another part of cos-

sories, make-up and hair. The make-up 
used on stage is heavier than street 
makeup. However, Humphrey says that 
the IPFW theatre performers usuallj' do 
not use a lot of makeup due to the prov 
imity of the audience. Costumes and 
sceneo' at IPFW may be created, bought 

Another aspect of theatre perfor- 
mance consists of acting, John Crewdson 
is a third year theatre major and said 
that acting Is his passion, 

-Memorizing lines is easy. 1 just 
write down all my lines and then keep 
saying them again and again. Putting 
meaning or an objective behind every 
word is the tough part. It has to appear 

According to Crewdson, some of the 
keys to being an actor or actress are to 
be a good listener and respond to other 
actors. A person also has to be comfort- 
able on stage, said Crewdson, 

'If you don't know yourself, how 
well can you change to become someone 
else? People react to how you walk, talk, 
the expressions on your face and how 
you carry yourself," said Crewdson. 

Life said that the theatre majors at

IPFW French club sponsors films at Cinema Center 



by Nancy Simmonds, 
Slatf Writer 



On Thursday, November 4, I was 
delighted to view the IPFW French Club 
sponsored film "Le Diner de Cons" (The 
Dinner Game) at the Cinema Center. 

The movie was a hilarious comedy 
about stupid people. A group of obnox- 
ious and wealthy businessmen Invite the 
most boring people they can find to din- 
ner. French publisher Pierre meets 
Francois, an accountant whose passion Is 
building miniatures of bridges and mon- 
uments out of matchsticks. However, the 
tables are turned and Francois topples 
the precarious construction of everyone 
else's lives. 

This clever film had the audience 
roaring with laughter and was a delight- 
ful Introduction for my friend Rosie's 
first venture into the world of foreign 
films. Most people have a fear of foreign 
nims and subtiiJcs and It Is necessary to 
read quickly If you do oot understand 
the spoken language. There Is an art to 
writing subdtles and modem translators 
are doing a far better job than those of 
the past. Rosle said, "Yes. I realized how- 
much French I did not know, but 1 also 
realized how much 1 did!" 

One of the Joys of foreign film Is the 
lack of expectations about the actors. 
Most are unknown to the audience. In 
U.S. films, typecasting runs rampant. 
Read a cast list and if all but one Is 
unknown to you, the recognizable actor 
Is either the hero or the s-lllain and you 
know he took the part to pay the mort- 
gage or alimooy payment and not to fur- 
ther his artistic career. In a foreign film, 



Kithoui knowledge of the actors, it is a 
cast of surprises. 

A foreign film Is an inexpensive way 
to e.vperience another country and a 
delightful nay to broaden your horizon. 
There Is a certain fear in trying the 
unconventional, choosing "Red" over 
"Crimson Tide," "Kolya" over "Home 
Alone," "(1 Postino" over "My Best 
Friend's Wedding" or "Life is Beautiful" 
over "It's a Wonderful Life." When you 
consider the price (less than SS), the 
time (two hours that you could have 
spent watching "VVaterworid") and the 
lasting memories of a mlnd-broadenlng 
e.Kperienee, this fear is easily overcome. 

The IPFW French Club has sponsored 
French dims for the past five years with 
the help of grants from the French 
Embassy and the Cultural Ministry of 
France, The French government offers 
these grants to promote their culture 
abroad. The club tries to choose films 
that present various views of the French 
culture including movies from French 
speaking North Africa or the Caribbean 
and films addressing issues of race and 
gender. 

If broadening your horizons is on 
the list of millennium resolutions, try the 
next movie In the French CLub series. It 
will be shown in January and is called 
"Jeanne et le garcon formidable" (Jeanne 
and the Perfect Guy), a French musical 
for the 1990s, Jeanne Is a carefree young 
woman who falls hopelessly In love with 
Olivier when they meet by chance on the 
metro. When he reveals he is HIV posi- 
tive, she declares that she will stand by 
him, despite his Illness. Olivier, however, 
retreats, leaving Jeanne on her own, 
searching the city for her lost love. 



If, however, you are ready to leap 
into life en francals, December is your 
month. Cinema Center's ne.\t foreign lan- 
guage film is "Conte D'Auiorrme" (Tale of 
Autumn), ivinner of the Best Screenplay 
In the 199B Venice Film Festival. It play 
December J-6 and December B. 

"Autumn Talc" Is the story of Magall. 
a lonely widow searching for romance. 
She CKprcsses these feelings to her friend 
Isabella who secredy places a personal ad 
for her In the newspaper, Isabella inter- 
views these candidates herself and meets 
Gerald, whom she Interviews extensively 
before telling him she Is really setting 
him up for her friend. Meanwhile, 
Magall's son's girlfriend Is also trying her 
hand at matchmaking. All of the parties 
meet at Isabella's daughter's wedding.

Scorsese scores with 'Bringing Out tJie Dead' 



by Brian Lindquist, 
SlattWriler 



Director Martin Scorsese's 
new film 'Bringing Out the 
Dead' is a gritty look at the 
life of New York City medic 
Frank Fierce, played by 
Nicolas Cage. The nim follows 
Pierce over two days and three 
of his night shifts. It Is appar- 
ent from the beginning that 
Pierce is suffering from his 
occupation and desperately 
needs to get out. However, he 
meets a breath of Inspiration 
on a call and finds a new focus 
that keeps him on this side of 



insanity.
