New program educates elderly participants 



by Jeremy Ecenbargtr 
Editor 

They're coming from California, 
New York, Connecticut, Florida. aiKl 
from all over the Midwesi lo sec 
Fori Wayne. The participants liave 
been promised a week of sharing 
Fort Wayne's huioric past, meeting 
(he Amisb neigbtxtrs. and learning 
about Fori Wayne's migbiy pipe 
organs from skilled players. 

The individuals are members of 
Ihe first two groups of Elderhosiel 
panicipanis visiting Ihe Simrtmii city, 
this week and nexi week. 

"The Elderbostel program helps 
the school, helps the economy and 
helps tbc panicipanis." said Irene 
Wallers, ditecior of university rela- 
tions. 

A loial of 81 individuals are par- 
licipaling: 42 this week and 39 next 
week. 

"We thought we'd be lucky lo 
get 20 people lo come," said 
Walters, "However, we are at our 
limit; we have a wailing list " 

The first Elderhosiel Programs 
were created at college campuses in 
New England in 1975 as a way lo 
provide life-long learning for per- 
sons age 60 and over Cunenily, 
more than 300.000 participants aged 
55 and over are being educated 
through Flderhostel programs all 



over the world. 

Saini Francis College and Ball 
Stale Univenily run Elder hciet 
Programs, but Ibis is the Tirsl attempi 
by IPFW 

"This is where learning takes 
place," said Wallers "The 
Elderhosiel Program is a very inex- 
pensive way of learning." 

According to Wallers, ibe panic- 
ipanis arc all on a lirrtiied budget but 
would like to continue learning So, 
Ihe trip is only costing the partici- 
pants $350. The lickeLs include the 
transponalion, room and board, plus 
food 

"A friend of mine has been 
altending Elderhoslels for years,' 
said Wallers. "He lold me ihai it was 
a shame that IPFW didn't have such

called, was created by ihe universiiy 
reblions department. The program 
is being coordinated ihrough ihc

in Boston. 

'rbis is a first tmie approach, 
said Pally Martone. voluniKr coor- 
dinator for tlie program, "ll's filled. 
and we're so excited."

The IPFW Interior Design 
I^ogram was invited to design a 
space in die McMillen Mansion. 
located at 1345 Wcsiover Road, for 
the lyy? Designer's Show House. 

The Designer's Show House is 
an annual event that allows city 
designers to showcase their cre- 
ations. Every year a house is chosen 
and reconstructed into a place of an 

In choosing the right house, a 
variety of factors are considered. A 
Show House commiiiee will look at 
square footage, traffic flow, histori- 
cal significance and architectural 
interest People have someiimes 
offered Uieir homes and others arc 
approached by the committee lo see 
if any agreement can he reached 

If students have a special home 
or would like to recommend one. 
they can call the Fort Wayne 
Museum of Art, at (219) 422-6467. 



Each year, after a house is cho- 
sen, designers are invited in to view 
the home They are given a ballot 
askmg for their first, second and 
third choices for spaces to design in 
Ihe home. All balloLs are put into a 
box. The firsi one drawn, gels Uieir 
first choice, as listed on their ballot. 
The process continues uniil all 
rooms or spaces are assigned. 
Designers are then welcome to 
negotiate among themselves, if 
changes are wanted. 

Several IPFW students partici- 
pated in designing the upstairs 
back hall and the porch. The 
remainder of Ihe house was 
designed by 19 Fori Wayne area 
interior design professionals. 

"Our concept was to make it 
into an art gallery." said John 
VoUmer, interior design program 
director. 

Vollmer says ihat the students 
took pictures from a phoiography 
class on campus and turned their 



space into a photo gallery. 

The use of black and white and 
sepia toned phologr^hs, coordi- 
nates with the home's overall

Students panicipaiing in the 
design effon were Denise Connelly. 
Barbara Gibbs, Nedra Hiday, 
Marabetta Leonard, l-aune Massolb, 
Judidi Nastally. Char Sheridan and 
Stacy Sluckey 

"The student group has been 
working on various aspects of die 



project. 'The Upstairs Back Hall 
and Airing Porch. " since November, 

The interior design students 
selected all materials, finishes and 
furnishings for their pan of the pro- 
ject. The students had hands-on par- 
ticipation throughout the project, 
removing existmg floor material in 
the installation phase and preparing 
and painting the decoraiive walls 
and ceiling. The students secured all 
malenals, furnishings and acces- 
sories al little or no cost. 

"The building hadn't been 
updated for 20 years." said Vollmer 
"We had to gel new carpeimg and 
wall coverings," 

VolUner said there was no finan- 
cial support from the university 
Therefore, the students went to area 
businesses for donations. Carpel 
was given by Airco, paint by

IJIIIUIIIUIIIUIIIUIIIlllllUE 



by Not Brcklry 
Copy Kdilnr 



years In ibis Teaiure I basically 
spout orr about what arc my favorite 
baseball movies or albums of all 
time etc, I doni really care if you 
(the reader) agree with them or not. 
I have such a high opinion of myself 
and my taste that I feel no need to 
explain them. Of course 1 also like 
professional wrestling, so my credi- 
bility is questionable. 

Enough introduction. let's get to 
this issue's focus. . . I plan on focus- 
ing on the greatest movie scenes in 
recent history. I would have planned 
00 using older films, but when my 
usual gang of idiots and I got togeth- 
er, we could not limit ourselves to 
around 10 movies. We left out great 
scenes like the end of Casablanca 
when Rick says, "Louis. 1 think this 
is the beginning of a beautiful 
friendship" or the Mount Rushmore 
scene in "North by Nonhwest." 

Remember no wagering: 
• The opening scene in "About Last 
Night . . ." James Belushi approach- 
es the comedic mastery of his broih- 



in in Ihis -L(.ni' Hub l.mvu plays thi' 
sUTUghL iiLin who helps the scene 
travel cohesively, but really plays no 
pan except to help the audience 
understand what's going on. 

• One of the Hnal scenes in "Stand 
by Me" when Wil Wheaion says, 
"Suck my fat one you cheap dime- 
store hood" to Ace (Keifer 
Sutherland.) This fuial act shows the 
determination and coming of age for 
four young boys who will never be 
the same. One died (River Phoenix). 
one became an efTeminate ensign on 
"Star Trek" (Wheaion). one has a 
perpetual heroine addiction (Corey 
Feldman), and one became the star 
of "Sliders" on FOX (Jerry 
O'Connell). They weie different in 
the movie too 

• The "Puitin' on the Ritz" scene in 
"Young Frankenstein," This Mel 
Brooks' classic shows Gene Wilder 
and Peter Boyle dressed to the nines 
and doing a song and dance between 
creator and monster The whole 
movie is a saeam, but the other 
idiots and myself fell this scene 
shined over all the rest. 

• In "Bull Durham" when Robert 
Wuhi strides out to the mound to see 
what's up with the rest of the team 



■iM'frii]AtiiAiirA'iii'frii i4i i rA'iiiAi 



lAhd Jeiide Ki hj\e a nieeUng in the 
miildle of g;inie and di.scuss how to 
get a curse off a glove, a good wed- 
ding gift and why Nuke's eyelids 
are jammed "Okay, let's get two." 
Wuhl says after he answers every- 
one's question. 

• Joe Pesci in "Goodfcllas" when 
he whacks Billy Batts The tense 
feel of the scene was masterfully 
directed by Martin Scorsese. The 
action builds between the two and 
Scorsese brings the audience into 
the scene by slowly moving closer 
to Pesci and Batts The scene is 
brutal, disturbing but at the same 
time, exquisite. 

■ "Fredo, 1 knew it was you" 
Michael Corleone says as he tdsses 
his brother before he has him killed 
in "Godfather 11," Although there 
were other great scenes in the fir^t 
two Godfathers, this one stands 
above the horses head in the first 
Godfather 

• John Belushi in "Animal House" 
when be starts his tirade with "Was 
it over when the ,. , Germans 
bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no! 
Cause when the going gets tough . . 
. . . ." One of the best motivational 
scenes in moviedom. 



• How can anyone forget the first 
lime they saw ihe Millennium 
Falcon break the speed of light, in 
"Star Wars" and bead into hyper 
space This effect has inspu^ more 
Sci-Fi dweebs, myself included, 
than any other moment in a Science 
Fiction fihn. 

• Speaking of sci-fi movies, "2001: 
A Space Odyssey" deserves a men- 
lion for the care fill manipulation of 
Ihe primitive man tossing the bone 
in the air and then switchmg over to 
a spaceship slowly orbiting earth If 
you had clairvoyance, you may have 
understood the message without 
having to see "2010." 

• Keeping the sci-fi flavor of these 
last few choices, we felt we must 
nominate the Borg Queen's entrance 
in the latest "Star Trek" film The 
disembodied head descending from 
the bowels of the ship gave the 
scene an eerie quahty 

Thank you for your patience, 1 
don't know if anyone stayed to see 
the credits of this piece, but who 
really cares about watching the 
credits anyway. The only crediii I've 
ever seen thai were as good as the 
movie were the ones in "Strange 
Brew." Take off. 



'Les Miz adds culture to writer, city 



by Scott Warder 
Sports Kdilor 

After a semester full of volley- 
ball, tennis and baseball I decided 
that I needed a little more culture, a 
little more variety and a bit more 
refinement in my life 

Being all polished up in a coat 
and tie was a little uncomfortable, 
bui 1 sulfcred through it as we 
entered the Embassy for last 
Thursday's production of Les 
Miserables Just to let you know 
how cultured I am. the last time that 
1 was ai the Embassy was to see the 
elegant stage production of George 
Carhn in concert. 

I might have seemed to be a lit- 
tle out of place at first, but a.s soon 
as the lights dropped and the curtain 
opened 1 was completely engrossed 



in the music, the drama and the pas- 
sion that Les Miserables offered. 

Jean Valjean, convicted and 
sentenced to 19 years for stealing a 
loaf of bread to feed his sister's 
starving son, has been released from 
his time on the chain gang and is 
forced to wear a yellow ticket to 
acknowledge the fact that he is a 
convicted felon.. ._ _ ^ 

The public condemns him uniil 
be is taken in by the Bishop of 
Oigne. While the bishop sleeps. 
Valjean shows his gratitude by 
stealing silver off of the bishop's 
table. He tries to flee, but is caught 
by the police. Valjean is astounded 
after the bishop lies and tells the 
police that the silver was a gift and 
asks to let him go free Valjean 
decides to rededicate his life 

After eight years have passed, 



Valjean has turned his life around 
and become a successful factory 
owner as well as the mayor of the 
town. He has also changed his name 
to Monsieur Madeleine to help hide 
his past. 

There is a scuffle m his factory 
after the employees discover that 
one of their coworkers. Famine, has 
a_jsecrei illegitimate . child. The 
workers demand her dismissal. 

In dire straits. Famine sells her 
locket, her hair, and eventually sells 
herself to pay for her child Cosette. 
She ends up getting into a fight with 
a poienuat client and is about to be 
taken to prison by Javen. the police- 
man who has been tracking Valjean, 
when the mayor and factory owner 
orders that she be sent lo a hospit^ 

To make the story short. 
Famine dies, but is promised by 



Valjean that he will raise her 
daughter as bis own. 

The time and seiung change. It 
IS now nine years later in Paris 
Valjean and Coseite wander the 
streets of Paris where they are 
harassed by a street gang. The two 
are rescued by Javen, who does not 
recognize Valjean until he has inade 
his escape. 

During their walk in the 
streets of Paris, Cosette eyes a 
student named Marius, who is 
involved in an attempted insur- 
rection. Though the two haven't 
met. they fall in love 

It may not have been a basket- 
ball game in double overume. but it 
had all of the drama and intensity 
Even the music was better Not that 
Jock Jams isn't good, but Les 
Miserables was ouLsianding 



Mode returns to ol(d form 



by Jay Benjamin Cuelbr 
Staff Writer 

Missmg in action for nearly four 
years, the "ULTRA" synlh-pop 
group of the 80's is back with a new 
look and a new sound to accompany 
their latest album This sound has 
been coming for ttearly seven years 
with the release of "Violator" m 
1990 that combined guitar with the 
already popular keyboard sound that 
Depeche Mode is so famous for 
Then in 1993 with the nilease of 
"Songs of Faith and Devotion" the 
group starred lo expand musically.

The once Synth-pop arena friendly 
group has staned to show a deeper, 
darker side of their existence With 
all of the bickering and drug over- 
doses that have surrounded the 
group for the last four years, even 
dedicated fans thought that they 
would never receive another 
album from the group These fans 
however, are the circumstances 
that have helped the group move 
into the partially chartered waters 
that they are in now. 

The feel for Depeche Mode's 
new album. ULTRA, is a mere 
extension of th^ fechngs the group 



and all of those in the past. There is 
an eerie, almost dismal sound. 
mixed in with a feeling of euphoria 
to basically wanting to weep. The 
morbid and tragic writing style 
that lyricist Martin Gore brings to 
the group, along with the hauni- 
ingly familiar voice of David 
Gahan. brings the songs out and 
throws them in your face. 

This is achieved with their song 
"Barrel of a Gun," Ii explores the 
endless possibilities of hfe and love. 
Their song "It's No Good" tells you 



thai there is hope, but only if you 
want to search for it. All of the songs 
in the album's repertoire are songs 
that can heighten any mood that 
you are in. There are many mean- 
ings to each of them. These mean- 
ings are all up lo the listener and 
lo your mood. 

This album docs help the Mode 
explore their musical talents 
There are a lot less keyboard 
sounds than in any of the past 
albums. It is a mote guitar driven 
album of despair and hope and the 
most moody, melodramatic album 
in their discography

Hy Year at the 
mevie thiatre: a review 



In the beginning of the college 
year, I wrote an article sharing my 
opinion on what movies I thought 
were the summer's best And like 
any other college student. I haven't 
seen a film since. No, actually, 1 had 
my chance to catch a glimpse of a 
few. So. once again, here 1 am offer- 
ing my thoughu on what five fihns 
have touched me since then. And 
don't worry, I will not be mentioning 
"The English Pauent;' it's received 
100 much credit ah-eady. So. let die 
movie magic begin. 

5. Though many bad reviews have 
been written about it, I found 
"Anaconda" to be quite action- 
packed. For viewers who enjoyed 
the great momenus of "Jaws." you 
will love this fdm On the contrary, 
my terror of snakes made it dial 
more memorable While some of the 
special effects were a httle on the 
wild side, the actors made up for it 
Upcoming star Jennifer Lopez and 
rapper Ice-T played funny and ener- 
geuc characters. Yet, let's be real, the 
snake was the highlight. 

4. Though I'm not a real Jim Carrey 
fan. I did enjoy "Liar Liar" 
immensely. White its comedic 
moments were terrific, it was the 
touching, lear-jerking moments thai 
rang in my head. It was a turning 
point for Carrey, justifying him as a 
true actor, one that could make you 
laugh and cry Nevertheless, it was 
his spontaneous humor that brought 
the fdm its magic. 

3. A movie that became a hit on its 
own and resurrected many of its 
stars was 'The First Wives Club" 
Let's face it. widi a film with this 

great of cast, how can you go 
wrong? Goldie Hawn, Belte Midler 



and Diane Keaton were all wonder- 
ful Yet. they were at dieir best when 
they played off each oQier. The 
thing diat made this film so great 
was the fact that this was a film that 
liberated women, without the use 
of guns or a pair of cut-off jeans to 
make die point 

2. Another great treat ibis year was 
the welcomed relum of the "Star 
Wars trilogy" The resurrection of 
"Star Wars" made history by 
becoming the highest grossing film 
of all time, surpassing "Jurassic 
Park." Is IS possible that its sequel 
"The Lost Worid" will cause a flip- 
Hop once again. Anyways, the new 
added tricks to the trilogy amazed 
audiences and, for me, brought 
goose bumps. 

I To name the one film that left the 
biggest impression on me is an easy 
task this time Being a honor movie 
fan. I would definitely choose 
"Scream." What idiot wouldn't? 
What guy could think of a better way 
lo spend two hours of their day than 
watching Neve Campbell, Drew 
Barrymore or Courtney Cox kicking 
some major butt. What girl can resist 
the seductive Skeet Urich? This film 
is every horror lover's fantasy No 
wonder it is currently the second 
highest grossing horror film of all 
time, righi after 'The Exorcist." It's 
just a wonderful film filled with sus- 
pense, laughs and some one-liners 
you will never forget. 

So, there you have it: my 
thoughts, my ideas, my choic- 
es. There were a vast variety to 
choose from, but these stuck in 
my head. But if you don't 
agree with me, please don't 
yell, just "scream." 



One will quench your thirst. 
The other could set you up for rape.

I*AIISfFUL IVIEDIXAXION 



A little boy finds loneliness 

in his own company. 
He searches for an answer, 
but feels there cannot be. 

Others offer help. 

but he won't let ihem in. 

He builds a wall around himself 

and slams the door again. 



he fears he cannot find. 

Days go by. weeks go by. 

He watches years pass on. 

In reuospect of his life. 

he knows it all went wrong. 

Is it his fault? 

Or should there be no blame? 

The problem he faces 

is no one knows his name. 

By keeping his heart cold. 

to those who mattered most. 

he finds himself wandering, 

as if he was a ghost. 

If only he could change the past. 

and let his feelings show. 

He would tell his friends, all the things 

that they will never know.

The woman lold ibe femlily clinic 
she was under the 55-ycar-old cul

against women 

Granted, 
older women 
generally do not 
have the stami- 
na that a 20- 
year-old woman 
has. but that is 
no reason lo 
limit a woman's 
chance lo have 
children. Giving 
binh at this age 
goes against 
nature since 
most women are 
p o s I - 
menopausal by 
the age 52. bul 
in vitro feniliza- 
lion (at any age) 
goes against 

nature. So to ~'* * 

claim it goes 

againsi nature just because the 
woman is post- menopausal is a 
weak argument. 

Although the physical dangers 
during pregnancy to an older 
woman are real — not only lo the 
woman hut also to the child— a 
woman should not be lold at what 
age she can and cannoi have a child 
Who is 10 say ihat a 25-year-old 
woman who docs drags is more 
capable of having a child than a 
healthy 60-year-old woman' 

SeT discrimination toward 



older women in this area is obvi- 
ous since many ihink it is wrong 
for an older woman to gel preg- 
nant. Yei our society causally 
accepts an older man's fathering 
of a child For instance. Tony 
Randall, who is in his 70's, 
recently fathered a child with bis 
20-somcthmg wife and we don't 
bear any complaints about that. 

It is a double standard. Our 

society sends the message thai it is 

okay for an older man to father a 

child, yei it is 

■ »&gt;- wrong for an 

older woman to 
mother a child 
Obviously the 
logic behind 
these arguments 
is thai mothers 
are still seen as 
the primary care- 
takers of chil- 
dren. So many

it matter if this 
older woman 
were married to a 
younger man 
who — as logic 
would dictate — 
would outlive 

— »*- the mother, thus 

being able to 
caie for the child? 

To presume thai we can deter- 
mine the quality of a child's life 
simply because the mother is older 
is absurd, not to mention offensive 
lo most people of goodwill. 

Those who advocate age restric- 
tions on childbearing should firsl 
consider the consequences of such a 
proposal in terms of the woman's

Low self-esteem and tiie myth of bodily perfection 






With summer 
approaching and thoughts 
turning to outdoor activities 
such as cookouis and pool 
parties, it's no shock that 
folks automatically contem- 
plate their summer 
wardrobe, or how little lo 
wear of it, as the mercury 
starts 10 climb. 
Accompanying this dearth 
of manufactured fabric/increased skin exhibiuon 
IS Ihe rise in bodily self-consciousness. In other 
words, if the thought of beaches puis your 
courage m a trance, the greater the Ukelihood 
you'll wear pants. 

This self- consciousness isn't necessarily any 
individual's fault. As we all know, images from 
television, movies, and magazines tend to create 
an ideal picture of whai the "perfect" female or 
male specimen should look like. But I smcerely 
hope that people realize ihat Cindy Crawford and 
Tom Cruise have made a career out of appearing 
"perfect" every day. 

If everyone could afford personal trainers and 
enough time off to body-build Im pretty sure thai 
there would be a loi less Chns Parleys and a lot 
more David Spades in the world. But. like it or 
not. life outside of Tinsel town is much more 
complicated. Mosi people don't Lve inside an air- 
bnjshed life-support system 

To be sure. I am not the great social theo- 
rist I fantasize myself as being, but I have 



"As we all know, images from 

television, movies, and 
magazines tend to create an 
ideal picture of what the 'per- 
fect' female or male specimen 
should look like. But I sincerely 
hope that people realize that 
Cindy Crawrford and Tom Cruise 

have made a career out of 
appearing 'perlect' every day." 



come to the cataclysmic conclusion that the 
best method of maintaining a healihy body 
weight involves math. 

No chalky Slun-Fasi shakes No "Eat a heap 
and lose weight while you sleep" diets. No 
"Absolutely the best ab-iortunng" machines need 
to be involved either Just math (of course exer- 
cise and eating healthy are important too). If you 
store more calones than you bum off, you most 
likely will gain weight It's that simple 

So instead of watching Mr T and Murdock 
exchange witiy rejoinders on reruns of "The A- 
Team" after dinner, go for a walk, ride a bike. 
COUNT ALL THE ROCKS (N YOUR DRIVE- 



WAY THAT HAVE FOSSILS, just do something 
to help maintain a healthy body. With machines 
doing a majority of our physical work anymore, it 
is imperative that we make up for that lack of 
activity on our own. 

Maybe in a million years we will have 
evolved to die point where wc don't need to move 
an inch to lead fulTilimg hves, but right now calo- 
ries still need to be burned off in order to sustain 
a strong physical (and mental) well-being 

Having said that, I would like to re-address 
the issue of self-esteem. Like many, I thought 
thai high self-worth was owed to me, that if I 
did noi have it then I had been wronged by 



1 am now learning thai self-worth comes 
from achievemenis and determination, not 
because I'm owed it I do wish that I'd realized 
that fact sooner, but revelation is welcome in 
my life at ANY time 

Certainly it is nice lo hear someone tell you 
bow attractive you are, or how intelhgent how 
shrewd, etc. But if you rely on the compliments 
of others as a drag, you are bound to come down 
from the high sooner or later, and maybe there 
won't be anybody around to supply you with a 
feel-good fix of flattery when you do. 

So set some goals. Stick to them and reap the 
benefits That is real worth Thai is real esteem. 
Just make sure to NOT set as one of your goals 
the watching of early eighties, zany action/adven- 
ture TV shows where everybody fires a gun, but 
nobody ever seems lo get hit.

I might have laken the easy 
way oui by naming co-male aih- 
lelcs of the year, bul with the sea- 
sons ihai Terry Johnson and Rico 
Martin arc having, ii would have 
been impossible lo decide on just 
i&gt;nc of ibcm 

The duo has been leanng up 
opposing pitchers. Between the 
D of them, they lead the base- 
ball team in every major offen- 
category, 
"Tprni Johnson, a senior center 

'^"y fielder, leads the learn bodi on 

and off of the field. He is pacing 
the 'Dons with 47 r\ins scored, 71 

hits. 16 doubles, four triples and 

28 stolen bases 

Accordmg lo coach Tony Viitorio, Johnson's 
stats aren't what make him the player that be is 

'The iJiing about Terry Johnson is that he's a 
great player, but more importantly he's a great leader. " 
Vittorio said "He leads by example He's not very 
vocal 

"Playing wim% the funny thing about Terry is 
that his best baseball is ahead of him, and he's a senior 
The reason 1 say that is because he was a Division-I 
baslceiball player at Lamar University for two year^ So 
now he's just starting to spend time with ba.seball and 
hopefully he'll gel a chance to play at the next level. 
"He goes down as onp of 
the five best players that I've ever 
coached and one of the five best 
people thai I've ever coached," 

Joining Johnson in the 
honor is Mailin. a sophomore 
third baseman. 

Martin leads the leam in hit- 
ting with a .398 average, and is 
also pacing the 'Dons with his 40 
runs baited in and 1 1 home runs. 

"Rico has come a long way 
this year," said Viiiorio. "Our 
biggest thing as coaches was to 
teach him bow to show up every- 
day and play and get ihuigs done. 

He's getting there. And obviously 

his stats are great and I feel like our program has a lot 
to do with building him as a player, but he's done some 
good things himself. 

"Just as il is with Terry, we haven't sec the best 
of Rico, if he jusi keeps wanting to get better, he'll have 
the opportunity to pla^, spnje.prQfe^^pnal ^seball " 

There arc many similarities between tbc two 
Each has pro potential. -Each has been pivotal in the 
baseball team's turnaround, and each has been named

Rico 
Martin 



The female athlete of the year 
wasn't [00 tough of a choice. 

Doltie Porch pushed the 
women's volleyball team to its first 
Division-II tournament birth in eight 
years, and even though they lost in 
the first round to top-seeded Northern 
Michigan. Porch showed that in only 
her second season, she is capable of 
leadmg the team on the court 

She also led the Lady T&gt;ons to 
ibeu fourth Great Lakes Valley 
Conference championship in six 
years as she recorded a career high 24 
kills in the finals of the GLVC tourna- 
ment against Northern Kentucky 
■ The sophomore middle hitler 

was named a member of the first team all-GLVC for her

Top coach - 



No one would have Uiought thai first-year head 
coach Tony Viitorio could totally tum around a cellar- 
dwelling baseball team with a 9-37 record last season 
No one except Viitorio 

Though tbe resurrection of 
IPFW baseball hasn't come full cir- 
cle. Viiiono has improved the team'', 
record to 22-23, but he knows thai 
mediocrity is not acceptable, which is 
why he has earned coach of the year 
honors. 

The man might as well ba\c 
the word "inlcnsc" lallooed across hi.-, 
forehead, because it's obvious lo 
everyone who has seen him coath 
that he doesn't expect his players to 
^ give all they've got — he demands u 

lOny You sec a liiae of Viiiono'v 

Vittorio ^'i;,^;;'" ^^^ ^"' " ""'" '' """ 

It was obvious from the sec- 
ond game of the season — a 14-10 victory over No. II 
Northern Alabama -- that Viiiorio wasn't about to settle 
for simply a good season. 

The team's record might not be where Vittorio 
wanLs it to be, but he has earned coach of the year honors 
for turning around adying program. 

His energy and confidence is simply beaming 
After nearly every 'sfortvehati on that I've had with him. 
he's told me that IPFW is just getting started — that 
there's more to come Coach, I can't wait to see it. 




Playoffs make up for lackluster seasons 

After nine months, NBA and NHL finally worth watching 



n 


^ Swa^iK' 


^itt. 





Months and months of boredom 
are over and the National Basketball 
Association and ihc National 
Hockey League are in the middle of 
their playoff seasons. I-inally. 

TTie two play for nine months 
out of the year — from October to 
June — and for eighi of those, 1 
think that I saw a combined game 
and a half between the two leagues. 

I love basketball and I'm begin- 
ning to love hockey, but I jusi can't 
quite get into their regular seasons 

I know why I don't like tbe 
NBA. It's just a cheap, fast-paced 
version of the game that collegians 
have perfected. Too much scoring. 
too htile defense and too many egos. 
Between Shaq and John Starks I've 
had all I can i^e. 

And I'm growing fond of the 
NHL. but my major problem is with 
hockey is that 1 don't care enough 
about one leam lo actually follow 
ihai club's journey throughout their 
regular season I can't exactly bold 
dial against the league, but if I could 
pay attention more, I think 1 could 
leam to love the game. 

Anodier problem with hockey is 
that I'm Ignorant about the goofy 
damn rules I'm pretty sure I've got 
icing and offside down, but hook- 
ing, slashmg, tnppmg, high-stick- 
ing, elbowing, roughing, fighting, 
boarding and cross checking all 



know the rules that 



would be 
much more 
convenient for 
me if there 
was only one 
all-encom- 
passing rule. 
We'd have to 
call it 

' w h o o p i n ' 
ass." 

Tbe only 

reason diat I 

because 

I've mastered Stanley Cup on my 
Ninlendo. Well, mastered might be a 
bit of an ovcrstaiement, bui what 
I've learned about the game. I can 
attribute to the countless hours I've 
spent playing that game. 

So normally I keep my distance, 
but now that tbe playo^s have start- 
ed, I've become enthralled with the 
two leagues. It's like I'm possessed 
I just can't get enough 

I thought Uiat I was going cta^y 
when I found myself waiching tbe 
Utah Jazz play the LA Clippef, 
Who the bell cares about cither of 
those two teams? But there 1 was, 
watching as if my life depended on 
every crisp John Stockton pass and 
on every Jazz basket 

Ii's been the same wiib hockey, 
too In die past week alone I've seen 
a few games and a couple of 
thnlling overtimes 

You might say that I'm a fair- 
weather fan, wbicb is probably true. 
but there is just an electricity in the 
air during the playoffs that is imss- 
ing in the regular season. All eight 



months of it 

Especially m hockey It's a lot 
tuning into auto racing — only 
waiching on the off-chance that you 
might get to see a few mangled cars 
screaming down the back stretch 

During hockey's regular season, 
normally I only turn a game on hop- 
ing to see a couple of grown men 
pull each other's shirts over iheir 
heads and just smack the living hell 
out of each odier. 

But not m the playoffs. There I 
warn (0 see stilling defense and 
bone-crushing hits. Goalies making 
glove saves and Greizky on a break- 
away I cant get enough 

If anyone's got any tips for me 
on how I can enjoy the regular sea- 
sons like I do the playoffs, I'd be 
wilhng to listen. 

I guess you could say that I've 
got a playoff joncs.
