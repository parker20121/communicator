Domestic argument allegedly results 
in death of Purdue professor's wife 



By Jo Ann Stein Tort h 
Newi Editor 

A domestic dtipuie between a 
Purduc-Wesi Lafayette prole nor and 
bis wife allegedly ended in her death 
earlier this week. 

Edgar Richard Knapp, Jr. of West 
Lafayette, Ind., and his wife, Brenda 
Lee Kasnrjion, were involved in a 
domestic argument on Sunday, July 
24. said Dennii Mitchell. West 
Lafayette police chief . 

Mitchell stated that, during the dis- 
pute, Kasarjian allegedly pulled out a 
38 caliber revolver that belonged to 
btr. Knapp then allegedly overpow- 
ered his wife, took the weapon from

her and shot her. 

The Tippecanoe county coroner's 
office estimated the time of the 

shooting to be 11.08 p.m Kasarjian 
was pronounced dead on arrival at 
11:50 p.m. at St. Elizabeth Hospital 
in West Lafayette. 

According to William Schultz of 



the 



i offici 






entered Kasarjian's upper torso or 
head. No other details were available 
at press lime. 

Knapp is being held in West 
Lafayette without bond for 72 hours. 
Formal charges ore pending. 

Knapp, an associate professor of 
computer science, has been employed 
by Purdue since 1992. Kasarjian was 



a former police officer from Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla. 

The couple met in Austin. Tex.. 
while Knapp was studying for his 
doctorate. 

After the shooting, the police left 
Kasarjian's and Knupp's two chil- 
dren. Elizabeth, age 5, and 
Alexander, age 2, in the care of a 
neighbor until the victim's sister 
arrives from Florida to take c

Tribal retaliation leads to Rwandan civil strife 



When walking into Goma, Zaire, one 
walks into an earthbound incarnation of 
hell. Whal began as a civil war between 
two tribes has become one of the great- 
est human tragedies since the Final 
Solution. In Rwandan border towns, 
bodies back up the water supplies, and 
corpses of relatives spoil the soil and 
pollute the air. Whether man, woman or 
child, cholera claims tbem all and will 
likely lake 50,000 or better before it is 
through. Even the wicked talons of 
bubonic plague are feared to have crept 
from Ihc deepest pits lo afflict this dis- 
integrating population. 

News reports in every form of media 
are clogged with the nefarious details of 
what is occurring there. 500,000 to 
700,000 people have been murdered. 
1.9 million arc displaced in their own 
land. 2.2 million arc running for iheir 
lives. The total population is only 7.5 
million. As people fall dead from dehy- 
dration and malnutrition, the fighting 
continues. A Tutsi woman was accused 
of serving poisoned tea lo 60 Rwandan 
soldiers who are all dead and she, in 
turn, was beaten lo dealh. On the road 
lo Goma's airport, Hutu soldiers attack 
a lone man, beat him, lay him on the 
ground and jump on bis back until bis 
spine snaps. Madness is common. 

How did this all slan, and where are 
the leaders to stop it? Ii alt began with 
the assassination of Hutu president 
Juvenal Habyarimana. The Hutus retali- 
ated by slaughtering every Tutsi Ihey 
encountered. Then the Tutsi rebels, ihc 
Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), retaliat- 



ed by amazingly defeating the Hufu 
military, effectively driving them west 
and with them a scourge of Hutu 

Eventually, Hutu and Tutsi alike 
began fleeing the violence with nothing 
but what they could manage on Ibeir 
backs. All those who flee fear dealh, 
but risk ii in a desperate attempt to 

Hutu politicians constantly broadcast 
messages lo iheir people. They tell their 
Hutu followers. "Flee, or Ihe Tutsi and 
the RPF will kill you in revenge. If you 
don't escape, we will kill you because 
you're a iroilor." 

Brussels -trained economist Jerome 
Bicamumpaka. who joined ihe Hutu 
government after Ibe murder of its pres- 
ident, was quoted in Time magazine as 
laying, "We are their government. Of 
course, they will follow their govern- 
ment. I could live in Nairobi or Paris. 
But I will stay here because this is 
where my people arc. If Ihe French 
leave, there will be no protection (for 
the Tutsis). You cannot oblige us not to 
talk. It is freedom of the press." 

What the Hutus are really doing is 
fueling the death of 

Tutsis, as well as iheir own people. 
Propelled by greed and ignorance, they 
are inciting war crimes on inconceiv- 
able scales. Tutsi rebels have shown 
amazing restraint in not taking all of 
them by the throat and destroying them 
utterly. 

The French, traditional allies of the 
Hutu govcmmenl, are lo* to respond. 
When RPF officials called on them to 
arrest Hutu militiamen responsible for 
war crimes, Ihe French responded by 



saying tbey had lo wait on United 
Nations' guidelines for dealing with 
such individuals. 

Much of the Hutu army is comprised 
of renegades whose superior officers 
tolerate their raping, drinking and 
chaos. These criminals now prey on 
Tutsi and Hutu alike. Drunk or stoned

demanding bribes and a portion of the

only other option is to die. 

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali has estimated Ibat the 
crisis require, at this very moment, an 
investment of $434 million lo alleviate 
suffering, but the figures grow too 
rapidly (o calculate effectively. 
Boutros-Ghali has constantly urged a 
maximized relief effort and has criti- 
cized U.N. member countries, particu- 
larly ibe United States, for not respond- 
ing effectively or quickly enough. 

So for, President Clinton has con- 
tributed just over S150 million to the 
nation, but refuses lo engage in a full- 
scale relief operation. Aid flights are 
now constant, if they make it to Goma's 
damaged airfield. Some planes are said 
to have dropped their payloads up to a 
mile away from the drop site, sending 
relief troops scattering in search of 
them. 

But it is not enough Hundreds of 
thousands have so far died and hun- 
dreds of thousands more will die before 
it is finished. Most of the work is being 
done by the Red Cross; UNICEF; and 
Doctors Without Borders, the French 
relief agency which dispenses field hos- 
pitals and physicians to the world's 
most war lorn zones. ♦

The Indiana-Purdue Student 
Government Association (IPSGA) con- 
vened recently for a regularly sched- 
uled senate meeting. 

According to Mark King, president of 
Ihe student body, open IPSGA projects 
include: 

1. Providing Internet computer access 
to all 1PFW students 

2. Extending Walb Union facilities — 
this effort includes moving all adminis- 
trative offices, except the dean of stu- 
dents' office, to Kcltler, and moving all 
student services offices currently locat- 
ed in Kettler to Walb. 

3. Updating student services cards — 
to include a photo on Ihe cord, render- 
ing the cord a legal I.D. 

4. Restructuring campus parking — to 
provide additional parking areas and 
maximize parking space 

5. Restoring the 50/50 split— current- 
ly Athletics receives 60 percent of stu- 
dent services fees, while IPSGA 
receives 40 percent. 

6. Lobbying slate legislature for 
additional university funding. 



7. Establishing an intcrcampus 
Purdue Student Associations prob- 
lem-solving learn — in order lo 
share best practices and discuss 
shared problems and potential solu- 
tions. 

8 Researching IPSGA self-pro- 
motional campaign possibilities —

9. Erecting a vcten 
on campus. 

Oiher IPSGA business includes a 
child care proposal Ibai is pending 
IPFW administrative review. The 



proposed facility would be located 
in Walb Union. Fees for child care 
services would include only regis- 
tration and usage fees. At the end 
of each fiscal year, an IPGSA sub- 
sidy was proposed to help pay any 
child care center project deficit. 

Student Affaire Senator Colleen 
Lemmon reported that Don Kolter 
has been contacted about revarnish- 
ing the picnic tables. A date for the 
work will be discussed at ibe next 

Finally. IPSGA senator Cecil 
Baker was appointed to the senate 
pro-temp position. ♦

The IPFW School of Engineering and 
Technology will soon have a new dean: 
George Kartsounes. who has been pro- 
fessor and head of the mechanical engi- 
neering department at GMI 
Engineering and Management Institute 
in Flint. Mich., since 1987, will assume 
his new position at IPFW effective 
August 1. 

The school of Engineering and 
Technology currently enrolls approxi- 
mately 600 full-time and 900 part-lime 
students. 



Kartsounes began his work al GMI as 
a professor of mechanical engineering 
and assistant director of research and 
graduate studies in 1984. 

Kartsounes holds three degrees in 
mechanical engineering. He earned a 
Ph.D. from Purdue University in 1970, 
an M.S. from the University of 
Pittsburgh in 1964 and a B.S from the 
University of Illinois- Urban a in 1963. 

His research projects have been in the 
areas of applied thermodynamics, heat 
transfer, fluid mechanics, analysis of 
thermal systems and process simula- 
tion. He also hold three joint patents for 
air energy storage power plants. ♦

Chowdhury was born in Jhargram, 
West Bengal. India. He came to IPFW 
in 1970 and was promoted to full pro- 
fessor in 1992. He was granted a Ph.D. 
in geophysics from Texas A&amp;M 
University in 1961. He received a 
Master of Technology degree in 1958 
and a B.S. in 1956 from the Indian 
Institute of Technology. Kharagpur. 



More married women in the United 
States are joining today's work force 
for a new kind of insurance — divorce 
insurance, according lo Elyce Rotella. 
Associate Professor of Economics. 
Indiana University, Bloomington. 

Rotella said Ibe reason for an 
increase of married women entering 
the work place is to provide a cushion 
for themselves — something to fall 
back on in case of a divorce. 

"For most women, divorce is an 
economic disaster, and they need to 
engage in behaviors that will provide 
a cushion." said Rotella. 

Rotella stresses that women must 
be dependent on their own earnings 
If a woman is not currently in Ihe 
work force, behavioral changes that 
Rotella advocates are training, educa- 
tion and maintaining attachments to 
the labor force (while still married). 

According to Rotella. when a 

decrease drastically. Instead of hav- 
ing a combined earnings with her 
husband, she receives virtually no 
alimony and. if she has children, 
child support will be unsubstantial. 
"Sixty percent of divorced women 



with children only receive an average 
of S4.000 a year in child support,!' 
said Rotella. 

"Most women find themselves sud- 
denly and totally dependent on them- 
selves. Studies show their standard ojf 
living decreases," she added 

Rotella also said that between one- 
half to Iwo-lbirds of first marriages 
end in divorce.

Decisions finding for students 
having Ihe right to publish and

student newspaper free from 
censorship clearly underscore 
the right of students for free- 
dom of expression. Neither 
students nor faculty shed con- 
stitutional rights as they enter 
the IPFW campus. 

Tbe IPFW Student 
Handbook clearly states these 
rights in the IPFW code of 
Student Rights, 
Responsibilities and Conduct. 
In the 1994-93 edition, it is 
stated in the proomble, "values 
Include freedom of inquiry, 
intellectual honesty, freedom 
for the open expression of 
ideas and opinions within lim- 
its that protect the rights of 
Others, and respect the views 
and the dignity of other per-

codo include the freedom stu- 
dents have to raise relevant 
issues, offer reasonable doubts 
about data presented and 
express alternative opinions in the 
classroom as long as the freedom 
docs not interfere with Ihe academic 
process of the class. The code fur- 
ther provides the right to form, join 
and participate in groups; the free- 
dom of assembly; tbe right to dis- 
tribute written material on campus: 
and the right to publish student pub- 
lications without unlawful censor- 
ship. For all of these rights, appeals 
procedures have been established 
whenever a student or a group of • 
students claim that these rights have 
been violated.

College administra-

nine broad categories of unprotect-

including obscenity, defamation

imminent lawless activity, fighting

matters involving national security

how to publish a paper. Tbe 
adviser is also to evaluate the 
quality of tbe stories. This 
includes structure, grammar,

The 
I 



e questions 
our own, as follows: 

1. Guilty until proven inno- 
cent. With respect to O.J,, this 
concept seems to have been 
thrown out the window not only 
by a majorily of American citi- 
zens, but the entire mass media as 
well. Can anyone remember such 
a media feeding frenzy in the last 
20 years? 

2. Time magazine, as well as 
other renowned publications, has 
played upon the infamous 911 
call made by Nicole Simpson to 
police in October, 1993. 
Domestic violence is quickly 
becoming a "hot" topic to ana- 
lyze. With all due respect, are we 
to believe that domestic violence, 
as despicable as it is, automati- 
cally makes one a murderer? 

3. The manner in which the 
police are (mis)handling this 
case: 

It appears as if they have con- 



dence? 

5. Why did the police not han- 
dle the situation at O.J.'s estate 
like they would any other emer- 
gency situation or crisis? 

6. Lead attorney Robert 
Shapiro asked several of tbe key 
investigators why they did not 
call for backup and or wear bul- 
letproof vests if, indeed, they felt 
that they were in a grave and 
urgent situation. Those who were 
cross examined testified that nei- 



ther of the 



I listed [ 



:ted 



ccd Mr. 



impson even before a trial ha 
egun. Why was O.J.'s estati 
ivesligaled before the scene of 



were utilized. 

7. There was also conflicting 
testimony concerning the eldest 
daughter, Arnellc Simpson, who 
was at the house when Ihe police 
entered the estate. She testified 
that she did not give the police 
permission to search the estate, 
yet they felt compelled to do so 
anyway. The investigating offi- 
cers stated that she did give per- 
mission for them to siart search- 
ing for evidence. Who's telling 
the truth? 

8. What was Ronald Goldman 
doing at Ms. Simpson's resi- 
dence? 

Was he there simply to return 



sunglasses? Since when do 
restaurant employees volunteer to 
return patrons' lost articles? 

9. Did any of the victims have 
any outstanding gambling debts 
or drug habits that they no longer 
could support? 

10. Apparently, Mr. Goldman 
changed clothes after leaving the 
restaurant. Where and when did 
he find time to change clothes? 

To top off all these inquires 

every American should be con- 
cerned that now their Fourth 
Amendment rights may be in 

jeopardy. 

For example, if the police feel 
that there is a grave situation on 
an individual's property, they can 
search both the property and per- 
sonal possessions. The judge in 



the Sir 



:ont OUt this 



message when she allowed evi- 
dence to be entered into the court 
record that was "found" without 
a search warrant. 

The most important question, 
though, concerns the Simpsons' 
two minor children, Justin and 
Syndcy. No one, not even the 



any t 



; to 



how the coverage of this trial has 
affected cither of the two. 

Bolh of these children not only 
do not have a molher, but they 
have also lost a father for a lime 
unknown. ♦

one point. I could easily do research to 
tell you what the exact statistics are for

of this country; instead, I want to 
tell you a story about a very 
bright young man that I recently 
met. His name is Joe. 

Joe started to recognize bis 
homosexuality at tbe early age of 
eight. By the time be was thir- 
teen, he bad done some experi- 
menting with other teen boys lo 
confirm his feelings. But be was 
raised by devoted Catholics who 
loved him deeply and already 
had his life planned for him. 
Their plan was for Joe to contin- 
ue his honor roll studies, gradu- 
ate high in bis high school class, 
enter a fine college paid for by 
scholarship and marry a petite 
red-head who would stand by bis 
side and raise their children. At the age 
of fifteen, Joe knew he would disap- 
point his parents deeply if he did not 
follow their plans for him. 

Joe's affection for other men grew 



Thanks to Phil Donahue, be saw that 
gays could build a life together and a 
normal family. Joe wanted a male 
companion, but be knew his parents 
would not approve. An intense argu- 
ment began to take control of his every 
thought. The church bo was raised in 



as no longer the young age of sixteen, Joe brought 
attraction. to his bedroom a small bottle of about 
30 sleeping pills. He began to dice 
them up into a fine powder to add to 
water for easy swallowing. He then 
wrote three notes: one lo his family, 
one to his friends, and one to God, all 
explaining why it was time for him to

A soldier's story 
by Perry Monroe 
Culture lives in cuisine 



To all of us, family has a different 
meaning. From cradle to grave, our 
family guides us in our life. 

The strength of a family is demon- 
strated in its ethnicity. The culture that 
makes up America is a multitude of 
subcultures. Through cultural assimila- 
tion many people have lost their her- 
itage in order to fit into the majority. 

My family is composed of Czech, 
English, German and Scottish ancestry. 
The strongest is the German, which 
comes from my mother's side of the 
family. My mother's father came to 
America in 1952 from what had been 
East Germany. He met my grandmother 
in 1923, and tbey were married shortly 
before World War n. Before the out- 
break of war in 1939. my grandfather 
sent his family to America while he 
stayed in Germany. 

My grandmother never forgot how 
to cook the ethnic food from 
Czechoslovakia. Ever other weekend 
when I was a litUe boy, my family 
would visit my grandmother. As soon 
as you entered the house, you could 
smell the borschl or goulash cooking. 
My mother never learned to cook like 
her mother my grandfather would say 
"if anybody can burn water she can." 

In my travels, I discovered a place 
that reminded me of my grandmother's 



and my heritage. I invited my parents 
out for dinner — the only clue I gave my 
parents was. "It's Russian." 

At the restaurant, Moscow Nights, 
Vladimir — one of the owners — greeted 
my parents like we were his family who 
he hadn't seen in years. I ordered din- 
ner for my family, everything ethnically 
Russian. 

As soon as my father tasted the 
borschl, be remembered tbe last time be 
bad eaten it My father commented that 
it was the best dinner he'd had in 
almost 25 years — pleasing Vladimir 
immensely. 

While at Moscow Nights, as older 
couple came in to have dinner, each 
ordering tbe equivalent of a hamburger 
and fries. Ok. Explain please, what is 
the idea of going to an ethnic restaurant 
and ordering typical fast-food pit slop 
fare? 

What it cost me to eat at Moscow 
Nights was no different than any of the 
fast-food places. The big difference was 
you are not rushed to make room for 
the next person. There are several other 
benefits I got from eating there. I saw 
my grades improve almost one com- 
plete grade. It relieved my test anxiety 
and provided mc with a healthy meal 
low in fal I have lost eight pounds in 
three weeks. 



Multicultural ism in our country has 
led to gross stereotyping. 
Generalizations are biased patterns and 
they abound. Unrelated to reality, the 
outcome may be positive or negative. 
Good food is good food; you will never 
know until you try it. 

Many immigrants maintain tbeir 
ethnic and cultural identities. Over lime 
they become bicultural, embracing the 
two cultures. Many Americans give lit- 
Ue or no thought to tbeir heritage except 
when there is a festival, which turns it 
into a party, such as the German 
Festival's beer tent. As a second-gener- 
ation German, I can think of better 
things than beer to remember Germany 
for, I am proud of my family's ethnic 
background. 

When I was in the Marines, the term 
"band of brothers" was a phrase applied 
to brothers in arms. Familial terms were 
exercised in an effort to form a homo- 
geneous fighting force. 

In my family, the ethnic ties are 
cemented with traditions emanating 
from both sides of my family. My 
mother's eastern European family is at 
home with my father's English and 
Scottish heritage. The only problem is 
my father makes a haggis for Chrismas- 
A haggis is blood pudding prepared in a 
goal's saznacfa. Yummy. ♦

Il's the year 2000, a new election 
year, and things hnvc changed drastical- 
ly. The citizens of the United States 
have just elected the first woman, a 
black lesbian, as president of this coun- 
try. She will lead the country into the 
21st century and beyond. The citizens 
have decided that justice will finally 
prevail in the Western Hemisphere.

How did this suddenly happen? 

After barely surviving the civil war 
between radical freedom-fighting 
African Americans and a group of 
while supremacist terrorists, the surviv- 
ing citizens of the country (the majority 
being African-American women and 
children, homosexuals, and other ethnic 
minorities who sought refuge in Canada 
and Mexico) realize that changes must 
be made in order for humans to survive 
in this country. The first thing the sur- 



viving citizens did was to elect a panel 
of people to act as their leaders until 
they became developed enough to 
expand the panel. They elected three 
African Americans: a male homosexual, 
a female heterosexual, and a black les- 
bian. The other members include a 
while female heterosexual and a 
Hispanic man. These five will serve as 
the temporary government until a per- 
manent one can be established. 

This temporary government must

ted by the Western civilization against 
(he entire universe. Then, they will 
begin to examine the remaining works 
of intellectual African-American writers 
and other writers who covered issues 
(bat deal with racism, sexism, and 
homophobia.

By the way, have any of you seen 
the k*y chains that were handed out 
at SOAR? They're bright p*ik ptasUe »i 
the shape of a numeral 1 with the 
words "Students Come First" written 
m blue on the front, Now, if students 
corn* first, why aren't gay and lesbian 
students protected In the Student 
HandbooW I'm not talKIng Indirectly 
protected, I mean directly protected. 

If students come first, where Is the 
child care facility that needs to be on 
this campus? 

If students come first, why Is the 
Student union filled with administra- 
tive offices? 

I guess these are different Issues, 
eh? 

To be FRAN* about the whole situ- 
ation, when the urtrvererty uses state- 
ments like that one to promote the 
campus to Incoming freshmen or 
returning adult students, we (as etu- 
c wts) ehould hold the administration 
r sponsible. Whether It's the chaneel- 
icr, vice-chancellor of student affairs 
of- the dean of students, who are the 
student "advocates." someone should 
bi accountable for the statements 
he that, especially when problems

Petty Crocker and stir up trouble. I 
Just want you people to stand behind

a certain administrator on the senior 
staff of 5tudent Affairs (Want a hint? 
Tfy the end of the alphabet.) Chat 
there Is a 'hft-llsf on campus. Now. I'm 
wandering If this has to deal with the 
sjtuatlon that Is happening over In 
Kettler. Even the vice-chancellor of 
Student Affairs knows what Is going 
on but will not comment because It's a 
personnel Issue. Whatever Is going on. 
sounds ugly to me. Three months?

Talk about students coming 
first.. For those of you who go to the 
library. I would suggest you keep your 
hands out of your laps. On July 12. an 
unidentified JERK was found mastur- 
bating In our campus library. I think 
this is totally disgusting, 5o. remem- 
ber, hands above the table, we don't 
want anyone getting shot. 

And for a last bit of bitching, I 
would lllie to know why there Isn't any 
African-American representation on 
the University Council. Now, I've been 
told that the list of people who sit on 
the council was taken from the names 
of senior staff under the vice-chancel- 
lors and chancellor, which Is fine. But, 
according to the August Briefings. 



this council Is to "provide Input Into 
the dec Is Ion -ma king regarding universi- 
ty priorities and efforts, and help 
Improve the awareness of activities 
and purposes of campus constituen- 
cies and communication among them." 
Now. If this Is the purpose of the 
council, where Is the minority represen- 
tation? I think the fact that there are 
no high-ranking African Americans or 
other "minorities" shows that IFFW 
has a problem. Evidently, we don't have 
any people of color In the administra- 
tion, and that's why none are part of 
the Council. What does this suggest? 

Well, that's all of the gossip that I 
have for now. 5o, remember, you didn't 
hear It from me. ♦

Holocaust was in its initial stages. 

Tbe government changed the laws 
to favor the rights of African 
Americans, homosexuals and females 
because they were tbe majority of 
people left in this country. Non-col- 
ored people still hod iheic rights, but 
they no longer can run over the tights 
of others. 

Homosexual marriages have been 
legalized, whereas, heterosexual mar- 
riages are stall legal but frowned 
upon because recent research indi- 
cates that heterosexual marriages pro- 
exploitation and violence against 
women, and the transmission of sexu- 
ally transmitted diseases. 

Tbe only time heterosexuals can 
have sexual relations is to reproduce 
and only for pleasure within the pri- 
vate confines of ibeir homes. Any 
form of public display of affection 
between the opposite sexes is punish- 
able by a Tine. 

Sexual harassment is a felony, and 
men or women who commit ibis 
transgression are banished from tbe 
country. 

White men are no longer allowed 
to serve in leadership positions in tbe 
military and business world because 
of their inability to think effectively

also, their innate insensilivity to otb-

punished immediately with castration 
and life imprisonment. 

Any display of racial hatred or

Book Review 

Homosexual 
bodybuilders tell 
their love story 



] roily wanted to like 
"Straight from toe Hear!: A 
Love Story" by Rod and Bob 
Jackson-Paris It sounded like a 
best idler to me. 
It'l an autobiography about two 
gorgeous body-building studs 
Who overcome Ibe obstacles of 
being gay in professional 
iporti They tell stories about 



. fall i 



cventuolly gel "married " 

However, there are many 
problems with this book— the 
biggest being the writing. The 
hunks should have enlisted the 
help of a talented writer to help 
them articulate their story 
Instead, we have the "he said, 
be said" effect that doesn't 
seem to work. They chose to 
each speak at the some time 
using bold face print for Bob 
and light face print for Rod. 
The book would have flowed 
better if the guys traded chap- 
ters. 

The book does have some 
great stories to tell. For 
instance, one of the best stories 

lies' refusal to attend tbe mar- 
riage ceremony. 

Mr. and Mr. Jackson-Paris 
also win points for using their 
role-model status in educating 

about homosexuality. 

If you need any other reason 
for reading this book, check 
out tbe pictures. In fact, if it 
had enough half-naked pictures 
of these guys in it. I might had 
even considered reading that 
Dan Qunyle book.*
