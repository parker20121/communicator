Campus plans memorial service for colleagues 



by Mishanna Wood. 
News Editor 



On Monday, Feb. 1, 
a "Celebration of 
Life Ceremony" 
will be held in 
remembrance of 
the fate Steven 
Hollander, associate professor 
of English and linguistics; 
David Gotlob, chair and asso- 
ciate professor of accounting 
and finance, and Kathleen 
Rassuli, associate professor of 
marketing. 

The memorial service is 



open to the entire community 
and will be held In Walb 
Ballroom at noon. 

Chancellor Michael 
Warlell will welcome everyone 
at the remembrance. 

Hermine Van Nuis, associ- 
ate professor of English, has 
put together a collection of 
poems which she will read 
throughout the ceremony. 

"There is a progression of 
ideas that 1 have worked with. 
The first poem introduces the 
first song. There are images of 
twilight, the end of song and 
falling," Van Nuis said. 

The IPFW Chamber 



singers will also perform. 

Speaking in memory 
of Gotlob is Dyne 
Pfeffenberger, associate pro- 
fessor of accounting and 
Finances. 

Richard Ramsey, associ- 
ate professor of English, will 
honor Hollander and Alamid 
Karim, professor of manage- 
ment and Interim Dean of the 
School of Business and 
Management Sciences, will 
speak in memory of Rassuli. 

Ben Gates of Campus 
Ministry will give closing 
thoughts to end the 
ceremony. 



"This is a non-denomina- 
tion service. We just want to 
remember good things on 
campus. When you lose three 
altogether, it's tough," said 
Marianne Messmann, coordi- 
nator of academic ceremonies. 

"The sun is shining, and 
there is a celebration of life 
and light," Van Nuis said of 
the last poem. 

According to Messmann, 
the ceremony should last 40 
to 45 minutes. 

Refreshments are avail- 
able during the "mingling 
time" after the ceremony. 

"This is a time of sharing 



and remembering good things 
and contributions they've 
made, rather than focusing on 
the negative side," Messman 
said. 



For more information on 
the "Celebration of Life 
Ceremony," call Messmann at 
the University Relations office, 
481-6105.

Fairchild receives 
Distinguished 
Lecturer Award 

byCameAnne Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 

After being named 1999 IPFW Arts and 
Sciences Distinguished Lecturer, David 
Fairchild, professor of philosophy and depart- 
ment chair, spoke about gender testing for 
sports and the difficult)' of establishing crite- 
ria upon which to base gender. j 

"Even if gender is to be tested, how do 
you establish the criteria for what separates 
gender?" Fairchild said. 

He was speaking in reference to females 
who are determined to be genetically men 
through a test given at some upper level sport- 
ing events, 1 

These women are sometimes disqualified 
for being genetically male and attempting to 
compete in the female division of the sport. 

Technically, they have male chromo- 
somes; however, they were raised as females 
and considered themselves as such, regardless 
of the fact that they have no uterus. 

Fairchild received the award in recogni- 
tion of his hard work as an individual in his 
field, as well as for his participation and 
involvement with the university since 1971. 

At the award presentation, friend and col- 
league Dick Hess, associate professor of com- 
munication, said, "David is truly a man of dis- 
tinction." 

"If you take a trip to his office, you will 
see that David is a loverâ€” a lover of truth," 
Hess added. 

Fairchild has authored five books and 
over 40 articles and has also presented papers 
at more than 20 international meetings. 

He does believe that in time, and with | 
more questioning and pursuit of knowledge, 
an answer may be found. However, he plans to 
continue keeping his focus on teaching at 
IPFW. 

"11 plan) to be the best damn teacher I can 
possibly be," Fairchild said.

IPFW funding 
in jeopardy 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 

If lobbying attempts by 
students, faculty, and alumni 
are not successful, IPFW may 
once again have its state fund- 
ing reduced. 

Already, IPFW is receiving 
lower funding than 11 of the 14 
funded universities in the state. 

"The big problem for this 
year is the Indiana Commission 
on Higher Education, which rec- 
ommends to the state legisla- 
ture the funding amounts," 
Director of Alumni Relations 
Jennifer Bosk said. "Their rec- 
ommendation for this year's 
budget would impact IPFW to 
the point that we would drop 
from being number 12 into a 
three-way tie for 14th." 

Bosk said she is appalled 
that IPFW would be put at the 
bottom of the list . 

She is also concerned that 
less funding would prohibit the 
university from providing the 
advanced technological training 
to students that other universi- 
ties have the funding to pro- 
vide. 

"Technology tops the list at 
IPFW (for funding uses) as well 
as providing a better quality 
education through updated 
equipment, facilities and addi- 
tional faculty," Bosk said. "(Less 
money) may translate into 
smaller advances in technology, 
with our needs not being met." 

On Feb. 10, students, facul- 
ty and alumni will travel to the 
State House for the third time 
to attend Higher Education 
Lobbying Day. Although more 



students 
attended the 
event last 
year than the 
two times 
before, Bosk 
stresses the 
importance 
of students 
speaking to 
state legisla- 



need IPFW 

students lob-

because that 
is the first group the stale legis- 
lators will listen to and believe," 
Bosk said. 

According to Bosk, in past 
years, 1U Kokomo has increased 
their funding through effective 
lobb) ing and now receives over 
SI ,000 more per student than 
IPFW, even though IU Kokomo 
has a lower enrollment than 
IPFW and has only 31 degree 
programs compared to IPFW's 
104. 

Although the state once 
considered full-time enrollment 
and the number of degree pro- 
grams to determine funding for 
each university, such an equi- 
table formula is no longer used. 

-We need students to 
explain to the state legislators 
some of the difficulties in being 
under-funded," Bosk said.

Applications 
for undergraduate 
grants, programs due 



byGailRuble-Crawford, 
Editor 



The Undergraduate Research 
and Creative Endeavors office is 
calling for applications to three 
programs: the Mini-Grants 
Program, the Travel Support 
Program and the Summer Stipends 
for Research and Creative 
Endeavor Projects Program. 

The amounts for the Mini- 
Grant Programs are normally limit- 
ed to S200. 

Applications supported finan- 
cially by the student's department 
and school or division will receive 
"most favorable application status" 
by the awards committee. 

The purpose of the Mini- 
Grants Programs is to "assist 
undergraduates with the expenses 
of doing research or creating pro- 
ductions in any academic field." 

The eligible expenses for the 
project should be itemized and will 



be considered by the awards com- 
mittee. 

Some examples of eligible 
expenses include copying and 
postage, disposable supplies, soft- 
ware, document delivery charges 
and equipment. 

Applications for expenses to 
be incurred between January and 
June 1999 should be sent by Feb. 
15. 

The purpose of the Travel 
Support Program is "to encourage 
undergraduates to present their 
research and artistic creations at 
scholarly conferences, exhibitions 
and festivals. Venues include, but 
are not limited to, undergraduate- 
only conferences and competi- 
tions."

Cafeteria undergoes changes 



by Ben Ruble, 
Staff Writer 



The IPFW cafeteria in Walb 
Union, called "The Fort," is making 
changes. 

Two weeks ago, new manager 
Susan Sanzone took over. 

Sanzone plans on addressing 
many of the student complaints 
abuut the cafeteria. 

"We have been changing our 
menu cycles, putting some different 
things on the menu that we think stu- 
dents want," said Sanzone. 

She also plans on offering more 
lunch specials. 

An entree with a side dish and 
dinner roll is one of the new lunch 
specials. 

More hot entrees are planned, 
according to Sanzone. 

Food that has been sitting for 
long periods is a common complaint 
that the cafeteria receives. 

Fresh food batches are planned, 
especially for the pizzas to help deal 
with those particular complaints, said 
Sanzone. 

Sanzone also said that she plans 
to increase "The Fort's" marketing. 




Some 
planned ways 
to do this 
include pro- 
motions, 
theme days, 
and give- 
aways. 

Currently, 
Pepsi Cola is 
offering a 
chance to 
enter a pro- 
motion for 
purchasing a 
2 0-ounce 
Pepsi bottle. 

You can 
win two air- 
line tickets to 
any location 
in the conti- 
nental United 
States. 

Sign-up 
sheets are 
available in 
the cafeteria. 

Suggestions and comments are 
always welcome.

TOPIC: 

Lazy Students 

WHAT WE THINK: 

Get busy and do 

something productive 
or leave! 



There has been a problem 
lurking around this campus for 
many years. Many people blame 
it on the community college 
type environment, but it is real- 
ly just a matter of motivation. 
The fact is that there are just a 
lot of people around here who 
are just plain lazy. 

The first problem that we 
would like to address is parking. 
We realize that most students 
have only been driving for a few 
years, but people should know 
how to park their cars by now. 
When was the last time that you 
tried to park in the parking 
garage and there wasn't a car 
parked crooked next to the 
space you wanted? It happens 
everyday for some of us. If you 
can't take the time to park your 
car straight, you are lazy! 

Another thing that we are 
concerned with is the amount of 
people that just "hang out"- on 
campus. There are a few people 
that we know that don't bother 
to go to classes just because 
they would rather sit outside 
the buildings and chat with 
whoever comes by, rather than 
go to the classes that they paid 



for. College is for learning, not 
hanging our. College is meant to 
also be a social experience, but 
some people take it a little too 
far. If you just sit there and let 
the day go by, you are lazy! 

Another problem that goes 
along with the people that skip 
classes and just hang out is that 
they fill up classes that other 
people need or want to take. 
There is another group of peo- 
ple that also do this. We'll call 
these people "floaters." Floaters 
are the people that just sit 
through class and have very lit- 
tle input or interest in the sub- 
ject. These people are the most 
disgusting to us. 

We try so hard to get into 
classes and often find out chat 
they are closed. It is so frustrat- 
ing that we know that there is 
probably one of those floaters in 
there taking up the space that 
should be ours. 

The big problem with 
floaters is that they really have 
no true interest in learning, but 
are more materialistic. They use 
college to just get a degree to 
make more money. If you really 
want to make money, do the 
hard work to make the money 
rather than filling up valuable 
class space that other people 
could use. If you are a floater, 
you are lazy! 

People that spend all day in 
the computer labs surfing the 
net or chatting really tick a lot 
of other students off. We know 
that those people really aren't 



doing anything constructive but 
wasting time. These people 
don't even try to have a social 
life here on the campus. If you 
can't get away from the comput- 
er, find a new friend. You are 
lazy! 

What people don't seem to 
understand is that schools grow 
with the more students that 
they have active in it. The exam- 
ples that we have given are just 
a few of the many problems that 
this campus has with students, 
but it all boils down to one 
thing for everyone of them: 
laziness. 

What we have to say to 
those lazy students is to either 
find some way to get busy and 
do something productive or get 
out! Yes, it is a little harsh, but 
in the long run it will be better 
for all of the students. There 
would be an increased sense of 
pride in the school rather than 
all of the criticism and negativi- 
ty that seems to surround the 
campus. 

There is something here for 
everyone. There are no excuses 
for not finding something to do 
here that is productive. We 
understand that most of the stu- 
dents are also full-time workers, 
but so are we and we still man- 
age to give you a paper to read 
every week. There's something 
here on campus for you. You 
just have to look around and 
find it. If you have already 
found something, we applaud 
you!

Get on the Bus 



To the Student Body, 

Every' student on this campus 
has come across some type of prob- 
lem related to technology and ser- 
vices on this campus. Just a few of 
the problems are upgrades for our 
computers, more hands-on technol- 
ogy for different departments, and 
student services; all are in much 
need for additional funding. 

The problems with our comput- 
ers are obvious to students. There 
are never enough, and the current 
computers are lacking the neces- 
sary upgrades to keep up with the 
world. The lack of hands-on train- 
ing on this campus is also a serious 
problem. I will use an example from 
the nursing and denial programs 
here at IPFW. In classes of 10 to 30 
people in these majors, every stu- 
dent must "huddle" around an 
example that the teacher uses to 
show the students proper training. 
This is not adequate training for 
people entering their respective 
fields. Hats off to the excellent job 
teachers are doing with limited 
resources. More training samples 
are needed to give students a true 
"hands-on" atmosphere rather than 
"huddling up" and just watching. 



More examples better prepare stu- 
dents and create a better learning 
atmosphere than the current "shar- 
ing" and "huddle up" atmosphere. 
Every student service is in dire 
need of funding. Two that immedi- 
ately come to mind are Student 
Services with Disabilities and Career 
Services. Student services like these 
are very important to the advance- 
ment of students, These are just a 
few examples of the widespread 
problems here at IPFW. Every' stu- 
dent has at one time or another 
come into contact with these prob- 
lems. The reason for these problems 
is that of the 14 public universities 
receiving state funding, IPFW is 
1 2th!!! We are in the upper half as 
far as student enrollment, but 
almost last in state funding. 

The Administration has tried 
earnestly to receive more funding 
by state representatives. This has 
fallen on deaf ears. We, the stu- 
dents, along with the IPFW Alumni 
Association, can make a difference 
on Wednesday, Feb. 10. Alumni, 
along with students, are taking 
buses to the Statehouse in 
Indianapolis to lobby for more state 
funding. It is very important thai 



the students make their needs 
known to the state representatives 
responsible for the lack of funding. 
There is no greater voice than the 
voices of many. The event is free, 
the only expense being lunch; din- 
ner is free. The event will be an 
action-packed day, and I urge any- 
one interested in going to make 
arrangements with professors first. 
The buses leave at 9 a.m. in front of 
Kettler Hall and will be back around 
9 p.m. The trip involves meetings 
with key state representatives in the 
Statehouse. If you would like to get 
involved and have a voice for this 
campus, call 481-6807 to reserve 
your seat on the bus. You can also 
sign up in the Student Government 
office on the second floor of Walb. 
If you feel you need more informa- 
tion, call 481-6807 and someone 
would be glad to help you.

Euthanasia and Our Pets 



I recently had to make the deci- 
sion to euthanize my dog. This dog 
was a member of our family for 1 3 
years. This was not an easy deci- 
sion. He started having seizures and 
the vet told me that, at his age, this 
was not a good sign. We did all we 
could to make him as comfortable 
as possible. Day by day, we moni- 
tored the quality of his life. He was 
getting worse. The seizures were 
becoming more frequent. It was tak- 
ing him longer to recover from each 
one. He stopped eating and then 
stopped drinking. He could not tell 



me how much he hurt. Making this 
decision is part of a deal I made 
with him at the very beginning. It is 
part of his medical care. It was time 
to put him down. 

As much as we loved this dog, 
and he was a highly regarded mem- 
ber of our family, he was a dog. He 
was not a human being like my 
mother or father, my sister or 
brother, my husband or son. 
During this process with my dog, I 
remember thinking that I would 
never want to have to make the 
decision to euthanize a human 



being. I think people should have a 
say in how they are treated med- 
ically, including working with the 
physician about their dying 
process. But I don't think we should 
ever equate the euthanasia of our 
beloved pets with the euthanasia of 
human beings. There needs to be a 
clear distinction between the two.

Commentary 



From the mind of a madman 



I Big Brother (or Sister) is Watching 



by Kelly Bergman, I 
Managing Editor 



From lime lo time I feel 
the need to experiment on a 
scientific level with things that 
1 have never done before. This 
time I decided to discover the 
limits of a small microwave 
appliance. 

The theory my study 
revolved around was that 
microwaves are powerful 
appliances that have been 
marketed to make people less 
intelligent. 

]t is well known that 
microwaves make people lazy, 
but what about making them 
less intelligent? By making 
people lazy they will not do 
other things that they would 
normally do and not aspire to 
do new and exciting things. 
Maybe I should be trying to 
figure out how microwaves 
make people lazy. 

How do microwaves make 
people lazy? The main reason 
that people own microwaves is 
for the convenience and the 
time that the device saves. 1 
feel that the time that the peo- 
ple save is Just wasted on 
things like television. 

People may feel that tele- 
vision may relax a person and 
let them be more efficient in 
the rest of their daily lives, 
but I have to disagree. Most of 
what television does is to just 
market new items to make 
people want to own more 
things that save them time. 
This isn't true. 

By buying more items, 
people need to spend more 
time at work to make money 
to buy those items. Therefore, 
they really aren't saving much 



time, but rather spending 
more time working for things 
that they want instead of sav- 
ing time to do other things 
like relax. Maybe microwaves 
don't make people lazy, but 
rather make them spend their 
time unwisely. 

On to the next topic: 
Testing of the microwave as a 
powerful utility. I decided to 
take this experiment out into 
the garage due to the ill 
effects that might possibly 
occur. DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY 
OF WIS AT HOME OR IN YOUR 
GARAGE!! 

I decided to do all of the 
tests on the high temperature 
setting of the small-sized 
microwave, since high is to be 
considered as the most power- 
ful setting. 

First, 1 boiled water. It 
took about 7 minutes. Then 1 
cooked some bacon. It took a 
pretty long time. Next, I took 
some baking soda and vine- 
gar, mixed them together, and 
stuck it in the microwave for 
10 minutes. It bubbled up and 
smelted pretty bad. 

For my second to last test, 
I decided to stick a whole meal 
in the microwave. The meal 
included a 7 oz. steak, a heap 
of mashed potatoes, some 
peas and a mug of my favorite 
brew. 1 wasn't too sure of how 
long to stick all of it in there 
so 1 set it to the longest time 
possible. 

To pass the time, I read 
"Of Mice and Men" and went 
back to see the results. The 
steak was done, peas and 
potatoes were crunchy, the 




brew was gone, am 
was cracked. 

I came lo ihis conjecture. 
There was some troll or goblin 
that came and took my meal, 
cooked it for me, drank my 
brew, and dropped the glass 
before returning all of it to the 
microwave. 

What else could explain 
the broken glass? Unless the 
microwave itself had a mecha- 
nism that came out when you 
weren't looking and did all of 
that. 

My final test was to col- 
lect as many steel products 1 
could and place them in the 
microwave. I turned it on and 
sparks flew. The microwave 
was trashed. 

I'm not so sure of how sci- 
entific all of this was, but what 
1 am sure of is that I'm not 
going to be able to use that 
microwave again. 

Also, the next time I use a 
microwave 1 better pay a little 
more attention to the process 
of how the food is cooked. 
Maybe the trolls or goblins 
can teach me a thing or two. 



Lobbying, continued from Page 1 



"Better technology for 
increased training translates 
into our graduates hitting the 
ground running in the busi- 
ness world and not needing to 
be re-trained by businesses. 
That translates into sound 
economic development for our 



community," Bosk added. 

There is no cost to stu- 
dents, faculty and alumni and 
anyone interested in attending 
Higher Education Lobbying 
Day on Wed., Feb. 10. 

Charter buses will be pro- 
vided for transportation and 



dinner will also be provided 
free of charge with a cash bar. 
Lunch, however, is "on your 
own," according to Bosk. 

Anyone interested in 
reserving_a seat on the buses 
or finding out more informa- 
tion can call 481-6807. 



Well, for some reason I 

ded to write about stu- 
dent web pages again. Lack of 
sleep must be getting to me. 

Perhaps the real reason 
lies in the fact that I had 
responses to my last story, 
where a number of people 
wanted me to put their pages 
in my column. 

I won't say how many, 
but the number happens to 
be a positive integer, and that 
is just enough people to con- 
vince me to do one more. 

So while I was checking 
out one of these sites, 1 
learned a horrifying fact...some- 
thing I won't reveal until the 
end of this article (don't skip 
down there, please). 

Well, here are some sites 
you just mightenjoy. If not, 
blame your fellow students. 

http://www.thecorpo- 
ration.com 

While this site is not a 
student web page, it's a good 
way to get started. Here you 
can find icons-a-plenty, all 
humorously crafted to perfec- 
tion. I already have a few on 
my site, my favorite being 
one sporting the American 
flag while proclaiming, "Made 
in the USA. ..by ille- 
gal 
immigrants." 

But remember this site's 
warning: you can post these 
up on your web page, but 
they must link back to "The 
Corporation." Otherwise, 
things only described as 
"very bad" may happen.

Applications, continued from Page 1 



The amount of an award is normally limit- 
ed to SZ50. As with the Mini-Grants, applica- 
tions supported financially by the student's 
department and school or division will be 
accorded "most favorable application status." 

Applications for presentations between 
January' and June 1999 should be received by 
Feb. IS, 1999.

else can 1 say? Great anima- 
tion! The creation from the 
mind of an IPFW student! No 
broken links as far as the 
mouse can see! A great space- 
eater when trying desperately 
to get a two-page, double- 
spaced article finished at 2:44 
in the afternoon. 

http://www.student.ipf 
w.eduMredkrOI 

This is the site that I was 
talking about at the start. 
First off, let me just say that 
while the site appears to be 
well-built, there are some 
dead-end links that brought 
me to blank pages. 

Kevin, if you want to 
keep these links while you 
finish the end product, at 
least put something on the 
page to keep them enter- 
tained. Maybe a picture of a 
corvette or Reggie Miller hit- 
ling a buzzer three with John 
Starks in his face and Spike 
Lee directly behind 
him â€” anything but a blank 
page. Even a "Page Under 
Construction" page would be 
nice. 

Anyway, the horrifying 
information I meant was this: 
in every lab, it turns out, 
there are cameras connected 
to the web. 

That means anyone with 
a computer can access pic- 
tures of innocent bystanders 
who happen to be using the 
computers. Even now 1 am 
staring into the mechanical 
iris of one, and it stares right 
back, displaying my face 
nationwide as I frantically try 
to get this done. Thanks for 
renewing my c&gt;nicism, Kevin. 

Anyways, as lucky as this 
will be to make it in the 
paper this week, next week,

cries presenls 



its l\en Meden 



by Adam Taylor, 
Features Editor 



The IPFW Plogsterth Fine and 
Performing Arts Series is pleased 
to bring the multi-ialenied Ken 
Medema to Williams Theatre Jan. 
31. 

The comedian, musician, 
composer and songwriter will be 
bringing along plenty of songs, 
stories, and improvisation to 
entertain his audience. 

Medema has been writing 
and performing his own songs 
since 1970. 

He brings together musical 
styles including classical, rock, 
ballad and blues to create a con- 
cert that not only entertains his 
listeners but also challenges 
them to become more active in 
working together to establish 
harmony. 

He also challenges people 
through his music to leave their 



"comfort zones" and reach out to 
those who are considered or 
treated as outcasts in society. 

Blind from birth himself. 
Medema understands too well the 
importance of feeling included 
and the need for social justice. 

Through his music, he tries 
to provide an enabling force for 
people to deal with issues that 
affect their lives and also encour- 
age them to be authentic and 
truthful in what they do. 

Equipped with a grand piano, 
two state-of-the-art synthesizers 
and an electronic percussion 
machine, Medema creates a flood 
of sound all by himself that not 
only entertains but inspires and 
informs as well. 

His comic and satirical skills 
leave his audiences laughing. His 
talent as a singer, poet and story- 
teller evoke tears, bringing out 
deep, unexpected feelings and 
powerful personal insights. 

On the stage, Medema is an 
entertainer, motivator, teacher, 



futurist, drill sergeant, trainer, 
host, cheerleader, insightful 
friend, member of the family, and 
master-of-cercmonies. 

With the ability to incorpo- 
rate all of these roles, Medema 
has been described as a "blind 
photographer," creating a picture 
that is not only moving but enter- 
taining as well. - 

Medema's concert is made 
possible in part by a grant from 
Arts United of Fort Wayne and is 
co-sponsored by the First 
Presbyterian Church and 
Canterbury Green Executive 
Suites. 

Tickets may be purchased 
through Ticketmaster at 424- 
1811 or at any Ticketmaster out- 
let. 

General admission is S15 
whereas admission for students 
and seniors is $10.

tact the School of Fine and 
Performing Arts at 48 1-6977. 



HIV/AIDS 

Q &amp; A 



Q. Can you get AIDS 
from a toilet seat? 

A. No, because even if 
the HIV virus could 
survive on a toilet 
seat, it would have to 
be able to enter the 
bloodstream in order 
for a person to 
become infected.

Originator of poetry slam, Marc Smith, will 
be at the Cinema Center Jan. 30, to lead 
a slam poetry session. 



Slam Poetry comes to 
the Cinema Center 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 



Poetry slam and the movie 
"Slam" will both be coming to the 
Cinema Center on Jan. 30. 

The originator of slam poetry, 
Marc Smith, will lead the slam 
poetry session after the movie is 
over. 

"Neither 'Slam' nor poetry 
slams are passive events for the 
audience," said Gail Westerfield, 
Interim Executive Director of the 
Cinema Center. 

"Slam" is about a young man 
who ends up in prison and uses 
poetry to survive. 

Smith wrote some of the poet- 
ry used in the movie. 

After the movie is over, audi- 
ence members are invited to par- 
ticipate in the poetry slam. 

"We want the audience, which 
will have just seen 'Slam,' to feel 
the creative energy of a diverse 
group of local poets and musi- 



cians," said Westerfield. "They'll 
learn by participating in the cre- 
ative, expressive event they've 
seen in the film." 

"Slam" is being presented as 
part of Cinema Center's Human 
Rights Film Series, made possible 
by the Indiana Humanities Council. 

"Both 'Slam' and the scene 
Marc Smith created in the 80s in 
Chicago are about the fact that 
everyone has something to say, 
that all of us are creators," 
Westerfield said. 

Admission is only S3 for IPFW 
students (with ID) and tickets 
should be reserved by calling 426-

In-home health care seeks 
increased funding 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 

Community members will be able to voice 
their opinions about care for the elderly at the 
upcoming Senior Rally Day on Feb. 3. 

Although in-home health care, the 
CHOICE program, costs much less than nursing 
home care, the state currently funds more for 
nursing home services. 

"Once the money for home care runs out, 
tax dollars start getting wasted to institutional- 



ize someone who neither needs nor wants to 
be in a nursing home," Diann Shappell of In- 
Home Services said. 

Those interested in attending the event 
should contact Aging and In-Home Services at 
(219)745-1200 to reserve a seat on the bus or 
to find out more information. 

"On Senior Rally Day 1999, we want to 
impress upon our legislators that they can 
take steps to help many of the elderly and dis- 
abled to live in dignity at home with the assis- 
tance of local health care services," said 
Shappell.

Let's Get Ready to Rumble... 

Mens Volleyball to square off against OSU on Friday 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Edilor 



The Mens Volleyball team will have 
quite the task against Ohio State this 
Friday. 

The Buckeyes are ranked sixth in the 
nation and bring quite the firepower to 
the Hilhard Gates Sports Center, 

Led by Angel Aja, Colin McMillan 




and Greg Lehman, the Buckeyes will be 
ready to play. 

However, the Dons will not be intim- 
idated. They also have a star-studded 
cast. 

Led by All-American Hector Soto. 
Javier Escobar and Scott Lane, the Dons 
should be ready for the first of their 
biggest games this season. 

This past week the Dons thumped 
Loyola, who was ranked ahead of them at 
number nine. 

The Dons won in four games: 15-11, 
16-14, 13-15, 15-5. This improved their 
record to a perfect 2-0. 

This past weekend was a great start 
for the Dons, but Friday's game against 
Ohio State and Saturday's game against 
Mercyhurst will show how good this 
team really is. 

The potential is unfathomable and 
recent talk has compared this team to 
being as good as the one in 1994. 

Friday's match will not only be a 
game of two of the best teams in the 
league but also two of the best coaches in 
the game. 

IPFW's Arnie Ball and Ohio State's 
Pete Hanson are good friends and expect 
this to be a coaches' duel, as both teams 
exhibit a good deal of talent. 

Hanson's team has Puerto Rican 
junior national team members, whereas 
Ball has some of the best volleyball play- 
ers from the area. 



The Dons have spent a lot of their 
time in the weight room bulking up, 
though. 

On top of that, this team has shown 
a lot of maturity. With these two factors 
in mind, look for the Dons to control the 
tempo of this game. 

The Dons returned five of their six 
starters, four of whom have strong jump 
serves. 

Chris Gisslen has spent two years 
around Coach Ball and the Dons offense. 

He will be given the reigns and will 
have to play a great game both menially 
and physically if IPFW is to win. 

For Ohio State, they have four 
starters returning. Three were on the 
Puerto Rico junior national team (Aja, 
Esteves, Pereira). 

Olree and Lehman have also stepped 
up in games vs. BYU and Ball State. 

Ohio State is also a very deep team 
and has an excellent offensive weapon in 
setter Aja, who averages 17.82 assists per 
game â€” an OSU record. 

However, the Buckeyes have had 
problems starting off quickly. They had 
to come back in their last two matches. 

If the Dons can get on a roll early, 
watch for them to pull their second upset 
in as many games. 

Bm if the Dons passing game isn't 
there, it could be a long night for the 
IPFW faithfuls.
