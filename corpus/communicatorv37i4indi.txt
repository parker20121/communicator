By Laura Dumas 



ipsa- 



IPFW students and faculty, 
as well as community members, 
are encouraged to come to Gates 
Sports Center on Saturday, Sept. 
16th for the annual Heart Walk, 
an event benefiting the American 
Heart Association. 

With a theme of "Change To- 
morrow, Today," the walk, which 
begins at 8 a.m., will support re- 
search and educational programs 
that aim to prevent, treat, and 
overcome cardiovascular ailments, 
while simultaneously raising 
awareness of heart disease among 
the general public. 

IPFW will serve as host spon- 
sor and also has a team participat- 
ing in the non- competitive walk. 
Other sponsors include Subway 
restaurants, Parkview Heart Insti- 
tute, Barnes &amp; Thornburg, Heart 
Center Medical Group, Indiana 
Ohio Heart, Fort Wayne Cardiol- 
ogy, Physicians Health Plan and 
Medical Protective Company.

Kids will be encouraged to sign 
up for the "Let's lust Play" Heart 
Healthy Challenge and will also be 
treated to a healthy snack provided 
by Parkview Hospital. 

Stacie Holley, executive direc- 
tor of the Fort Wayne metropolitan 
region of AHA said, "We estimate 
over 1,000 people walking, and we 
raise on average over $150,000 per 
year. This year, our financial goal is 
to raise $200,000. The Heart Walk, 
first held in 1994, has raised nearly 
$600 million since its inception, 
Research funded by the American 
Heart Association has led to piv- 
otal discoveries such as CPR, in- 
novative surgical techniques such 
as bypass surgery, medicines, and 
pacemakers. Although the event is 
free to the public, participants are 
encouraged to collect donations. 

"It's important for all of us to 
participate in the Heart Walk and 
do our part to help save lives,"said 
Mike Packnett, CEO of Parkview 
Health System, the presenting 
sponsor of the 2006 Walk.

strokes ranking third. In total, car- 
diovascular issues kill over 9 10,000 
Americans per year, and cost the 
country an estimated $403 billion 
annually. 

Deb Neuenschwander, a part- 
time IPFW professor with CASA, 
was personally touched by heart 
disease when she suffered a stroke 
three years ago. 

"I decided the stroke was not 
going to define me, " she said, "I've 
been fighting it ever since." 

Neuenschwanderhad planned 
to participate in last year's walk 
when a week before the event, her 
husband Ted, who teaches with 
her at IPFW, suffered a heart at- 
tack. After his bypass surgery and 
changes in both of their eating and 
exercise habits, die couple is on 
the road to recovery. 

Neuenschwanders health 
problems, combined with the fact 
that they have lost three out of 
four parents to heart disease, have 
motivated them to get involved 
with the Heart Walk. As captain of 
team IPFW, Neuenschwander esti- 
mates that 12 to 15 students have 



already signed up to participate in 
this year's event. 

"We're not expecting huge 
of money, but it's about 
is", she said. 

Neuenschwander says she 
feels that more college students 
should start taking responsibility 
for their health and lifestyle. She 
also says she believes that had she 
put more focus on being healthy 
when she was younger, she might 
not have had a stroke. 

"Students all probably know 
someone affected by heart disease, 
and at this point in their life, it's 
time to start caring about their own 
health. I was busy and didn't eat 
right or exercise when I was their 
age," Neuenschwander said. "I've 
heard a quote somewhere; Hered- 
ity loads the gun, but lifestyle pulls 
the trigger."

ticipating in the Heart Walk, Fort

Scholarships Honor 9/11/01 Victims 



By Carly Dachis 
Indiana Daily 



(U-WIRE) BLOOMINGTON, 
[nd. â€¢ Five years later, some mi^ht 
find it clifficull 10 look at the clock 
at 8:45 a.m. and not think about 
what happened on Sept. 11 only a 
lulf -decade ago. 

For 2005 Indiana University 
graduate Rachel Jacobson, it's not 
just Sept. 11 that it's difficult to 
cope with the death of her father. 

"It's not so black and white," 
Jacobson said, "It's a hard time of 
year for everyone, and I want to re- 
member the good things. I want to 
treat it as a celebration of his life 
and not a remembrance of how he 

In 2002, Jacobson did just that 
by helping establish the IU Stu- 
dent Foundation's 9/11 Scholar- 



ship Fund. 

The fund finances three me- 
morial scholarships each year, and 
this year's applications will come 
out in early October. 

Jenny Bruffey, director of 1USF, 
said the fund began because three 
IU students lost their fathers at the 
World 'trade Center, and so many 
other IU students were affected. 

"A lot of our scholarships are 
established by alumni, but this 
one is just different because of how 
tragic it was," Bruffey said. 

IUSF began fund raising for 
the scholarships in 2001 by donat- 
ing proceeds from Little 500 races 
and asking for alumni support. 
According to a 2002 press release, 
in addition to the $49,616.42 IUSF 
raised, Lawrence D. Glaubinger, a 
1949 IU graduate who lived in New 
York City at the time of the attacks, 
matched what IUSF raised. 



Following Glaubi tiger's gilt. 
other Indianaand Bast Coast 
residents responded to the news 
of the scholarship and donated an 
additional $7,000 to the fund. 

IUSF then met with the three 
students and their families in or- 
der to establish the criteria for the 
three scholarships to be awarded 
each year in memory of each of 
the students' fathers who died in 
the attacks. 

Each family had the op- 
portunity to select the criteria 
based on what aspects were most 
important to them. 

"I know that when I was con- 
templating the criteria, the most 
important thing was that it reflect- 
ed my father's beliefs and values," 
Jacobson said. "I was so lucky that 
1 got to play an active role in the 
scholarship decision lor as long as 
I did." 



Bruffey said each scholarship 
is a little different, and some of the 
specific criteria include financial 
need, a 2.7 or higher grade point 
average, involvement in student or 
community activities and an essay 
about the importance of family. 

"I'm really touched thai people 
took such a deep interest and care 
in making such a positive thing 
from something so negative," Ja- 
cobson said. 

IUSF Student President Elliott 
Chapman is especially proud of 
this scholarship because it differs 
from the other awards available to 
students. 

"It's a really meaningful way 
to give away money and help stu- 
dents at the same time," Chapman 
said. "It makes it more special, and 
it serves to remind people what 
happened that day and keep that 



Chapman said IUSF gives ap- 
proximately $80,000 in scholar- 
ships a year and has given more 
than a million dollars total since 
the organization was founded in 
1950. 

Applications for this year's 
9/ 1 1 scholarships come out in ear- 
ly October and will be awarded at 
the IUSF scholarship banquet, to 
be scheduled for late November. 

Jacobson said it's still diffi- 
cult to cope on a daily basis and 
not just on the anniversary of her 
father's death, but she maintains a 
positive outlook and her own me- 
morial. 

"He will remain with me in all 
my endeavors, wherever I go in 
life," she said. "I will never truly 
lose him because he is a part of

her daughter's former dance teacher and 
how his suffering brought the disease to 
their attention and they have been trying 
to help every since. Employee of the AIDS 
task force Jennie Arter began her involve- 
ment as a volunteer. I started volunteering 
in 1993; 1 have been working for them for 
the past five years. I got involved when two 
of my friends and a brother in law died of 
AIDS said Arter. Jennie Arter was just one 
of the many who were inspired to join after 



seeing a loved one suffer. 

As everyone began to walk a list of names 
were read for those who have died in North- 
east Indiana of HIV or AIDS. The last names 
of the deceased were not read only there last 
initial. This was done to keep the information 
private for families. The walk was 5 K, but the 
walk for those who are suffering, or know 
someone who is, will last much longer.

Transfer Students Speak on 
Matriculation 



Positive Expe 
Leaves Impression 



not think this campus is small, but 
it is obviously not huge. I person- 
ally like IPFW because 1 am closer 
to home and I think 1 am getting 
a better education as a result of 
smaller class sizes. I think the hard- 
est thing about transferring was 
getting used to the new surround- 
ings and making new friends. I 
think people sometimes underes- 
timate just how exhausting moving 
can be. You have to look for a new 
place to live, get used to your sur- 
roundings, pack, unpack, memo- 
rize your new address, etc. The fear 
of whether I made the right deci- 
sion to transfer, as well as the fear 
of my new college was stressful at 
first. That too went away once I 
got used to everything. I thought 
making new friends was going 
to be hard, 



Chain of Advisors Fall 
Through 

By Arman Ami i i 



Last year, I transferred to IPFW 
from Toledo. I think it would be 
wrong to say transferring schools 
was easy considering that 1 left my 
friends from Toledo behind. I had 
to make new friends, and 1 had to 
get used to the different environ- 
ment. Although all of those factors 
were pretty overwhelming. I was 
fortunate to want to come to IPFW, 
which made the transition easier. 

I think one of the main things 
I learned from 

transferring â€” but it did 

was that life Â»j think One Of the main not &lt;ake me

were during 

one point of their lives is how it will 
be later; that was a concept I had to 
'get past. 

I definitely still had a hard time 
moving because I hate change: 
however, I think moving to Fort 
Wayne was worth it. For me, going 
from a bigger college to a smaller 
college was definitely different. In 
Toledo, I walked everywhere and 
there were a lot of who I would la- 
bel "city people." IPFW is more of 
what I wanted out of a college. I do 



Now that I look back at my 
experience, the advice I have for 
people thinking about transfer- 
ring is to simply make sure it is 
what you want. If you decide that 
transferring is what you want, re- 
member that things are going to 
be different. That does not mean 
the transition will be bad. Lastiy, 
remember that moving is a chance 
to make new friends and if you ap- 
proach the move with a good atti- 
tude, you will find friends easily. 



I had a new state, a new city, 
a new town, and if that was not 
enough to deal with and adapt to, 
a new university. Indiana Uni- 
versity-Purdue University Fort 
Wayne offered the advantages of 
both Indiana and Purdue Univer- 
sity on a smaller scale. Who would 
not like a chance to become a part 
of this community? 

Now, for graduating high 
school seniors, many routines are 
in place to enable them to incor- 
porate into this system flawlessly. 
They have specific days to come 
in and tour the school, learn their 
new environment, and be advised 
as to what classes they may want 
to take and what career paths may 
be right for them. Specific classes 
are held so they can more conve- 
niently register for classes without 
fear of them being filled. Coupons, 
gifts, and speeches await them as 
they slip into this new lifestyle. 

And then, there is the transfer 
student. The transfer student is 
much more accustomed to col- 
lege life. In my case, I was trans- 
ferring from a university that had 
34,000 students. It was located in 
the middle of a big city and 1 knew 
many of the professors and stu- 
dents. However, I had to make the 
trip to attend IPFW. I had finished 
most of my degree requirements 
and was ready to graduate in one 
year. I sent in my transcripts from 
both a small community college 
and a large university, along with 









1 planned my fourteen-hour 
move to Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
On Sunday, May 14. I arrived at 
my new home and got ready for 
my first class, which started the 
next morning at 9 a.m. By that 
Wednesday, I began utilizing the 
university's online applications 
to check on my transfer credits. 
I noticed that many of my cred- 
its had been placed in categories 
that would not fit my degree and 
1 now faced two or more years till 
graduation. Slightly in shock, I 
contacted someone from admis- 
sions and discussed the situation 
with them. 1 was told to see my 
advisor for this problem. I went to 
my advisor, who was somewhat 
confused as to who should han- 
dle this problem. I left there with 
more questions than when I had 
arrived. 

The following morning, dedi- 
cated to resolving this issue, 1 
went and spoke with someone in 
my department. I was again sent 
out, being told I should speak 
with someone in the office that 
was in charge of this and other 
majors combined. I ended up at 
the department for the arts and 
sciences. Feeling like the de- 
partment was high in the food 
chain, I thought meeting here 
would have a great impact on 
my problem. I spoke with a lady 
there who emailed someone and 
made a copy of the information 
regarding my problem. I felt like 
things were coming together at 
this point. I was then sent away 
and told that the problems of my 
transfer would be solved. 

I continued with my sum- 
mer class for about two weeks 
until I noticed that nothing had 
changed. Snuieu'h.ii angered and 
worried (because without my 
transfers I was unable to register 
for any classes!, 1 went straight to 
the head of the arts and sciences 
department. He was very upset 
that my issue had reached him 
unresolved and explained how 
it should have been handled by 



the faculty. Next, he emailed an- 
other advisor in my department 
and asked him to review and re- 
categorize my previous courses. I 
left with a new calm and a sense of 
accomplishment. Two weeks later, 
to my horror, nothing had been 
accomplished and the person 
who had helped me the most had 
retired. So, I again contacted the 
closest person to the now retired 
department head that I could find, 
She called and spoke with some- 
one in my major who said they 
would finish the process for me. 
By this time, I had already taken 
a second summer course and was 
trying to register for the fall. If it 
had not been for Mr. Hicks, who 
went to great efforts to override me 
into courses which I could not reg- 
ister for myself, I would not have 
any schedule at all this semester. 
However, because it was so close 
to the new semester, all classes 
were full and I was stuck with what 
I could get. 

After I started the fall semester, 
the changes to my transfer credits 
were finalized. Now that I was not 
at all confident in the university's 
abilities to handle my transfer, I 
went to my advisor for a second 
time. I was not surprised by the 
meeting at all, but realized how 
much my old university appreci- 
ated its students. My advisor there 
had a file on all of his students and 
had a plan of graduation already 
worked out. If you had a problem, 
the advisors would pursue the 
answer and help you feel at ease. 
With all this trouble, it came to 
no surprise when I heard that not 
many students transferred into 
IPFW from other universities but 
plenty transferred out.

SuzyW. Givesacrap wrote on Bull (ions, random information, and 

Chit's wall at 12:30 a.m. meet random people was amazing. 



Like Atari in the 1970s... this was 
revolutionary. 

So, I had this whole column 
written out - ready to bust a cap 
into Facebook â€¢ when I log on and 
find... the apology letter. In psy- 
chology, it's called the fundamen- 
tal attribution error. I attributed 
the 'news feed' stupidity as an at- 
tempt to destroy the credibility of 



this 



untry. 



The thing I enjoyed about Face- 
book was that you couldn't just 
necessarily look at someone else's 
page from another school. You just 
had to live with the mystery of who 
they were from the picture that rep- 
resented their profile. The option 
of poking, which 1 honestly abused, 
was fun...and still is. Or, you could 
leave a message while adding them 
as a friend. I liked my options, the 
and the respect you 



could have for the site. At a time, 
it truly connected college stu- 
dents, allowing them to see what 
they wanted to see and when they 
wanted to see it. 

Facebook is evolving, maybe a 
little too fast. It was conservative. 
The information available de- 
pended on how much effort you 
put into it. If you really wanted to 
know something about a person, 
stalking would actually be an ef- 
fort. Maybe that's what the Face- 
book people wanted: to speed up 
the process. I looked at the 'news 
feed' as irrational, irresponsible, 
and cheesy. But the reality is that 
people are abusing this Internet 
movement and are using the site 
mainly for play, which doesn't 
make sense as to why people are 
disgusted by the 'news feed.' 

Clearly, people are not happy. 



[jg^^gg 



You look on Facebook and you will 
find countless groups dedicated to 
the destruction of the new layout/ 
news feed. And as the responsible 
creator of the site, Mark Zucker- 
berg, apologized and emphasized 
his intention for Facebook. 

From a sociological standpoint, 
I don't know if Mark anticipated

to such a free flowing network.

about this project, which is con- 
stantly changing. I think our gen-

result, the future for the upcoming

may not be acceptable to us, but 
represents an uncontrolled want

Reality TV All About the Money 



By Tiffany Ping 



Reality television is not a new 
phenomenon. However, 1 find it 
to be one of the most annoying. 
Most of us in the MTV Genera- 
tion assume that reality TV got its 
start with the wildly popular show 
"The Real World". Well, I'm here 
to tell you that it didn't. It actu- 
ally got its humble beginnings in 
the late 1940s with Allen Funt's 
"Candid Camera". So, for over 
60 years, we've been bombarded 
wilh crappy entertainment. 

I'm not going to lie. When I 
gel around MTV and any one of 
their asinine shows are on -espe- 
cially "The Real World"- I can't 
stop watching. It's like a train 
wreck. I have to watch. I have 
to know exactly what's going on 
in Sveilana's life and why every- 
one hates her. (I told you 1 have 
to watch!) Or who's "nexting" 
whom. Or who's raiding whose 
room. It's nuts. I can lose whole 
days because of reality TV. That's 
ridiculous. Whole days!!! 

Why is reality TV so addicting? 
Are there subliminal messages 
that keep us hooked? I mean, 
were Taylor Hicks and Katharine 
Mil'liee really worth 36 million 



people's time? I don't think so. 
Because of my lack of enthusiasm, 
their numbers weren't 36.000,001. 
Ha, take that FOX!! ('Course I did 
watch every episode of Season 1; 
but that will be our little secret.) 

I really don't understand the 
concept of reality TV. What's so 
great about it? We all know that 
reality TV is not really real. It's just 
a bunch of hotties running around 
starting drama, ending drama, 
sleeping with everyone, drinking 
and partying-unless, of course, 
you were as ensconced in PBS's 
"Colonial House" as I was. (Don't 
laugh; it was interesting ... and I 
don't have cable.) But, even PBS's 
attempt to be hip had its fair share 
of sex-related drama. 

We can't turn the television on 
without being slapped in the face 
with other people's drama. I don't 
about you, but I have got enough 
of my own. I really don't want to 
be involved in anyone else's. 1 ac- 
tually feel stressed out after been 
visually assaulted by the newest 
knock-down-drag-out on "Flavor 
of Love". 

Now, before you think this is 
one big whining session, I'll be the 
first to say that not all reality TV is 
worthless. "True Life" has educat- 
ed several of my friends and I about 
everything from being a porn star 



to being a Muay Thai Fighter to 
being a competitive eater. But, 
for every one constructive show, 
there are 10 shows that shouldn't 
have ever made it into our living 

"The Swan" is the perfect ex- 
ample of a show that, from the 
moment I heard the concept, left 
the sour taste of bile in my mouth. 
FOX's program focused on tak- 
ing regular-which, in the land 
of showbiz, means ugly-woman 
and had them undergo extreme 
plastic surgery. Then, as if that's 
not bad enough, they are forced 
to endure a pageant!!! A frig- 
gin' beauty pageant that will tell 
the no-longer-ugly-women that 
they're still not pretty enough 
to win. Just thinking about that 
show makes me mad (I can't say 
what I'm really thinking-there's 
too many expletives). 

The reality TV industry boils 
down to one simple fact: mon- 
ey. Everyone's in the business 
of making money and as much 
of it as they possibly can. To do 
so, we're willing to relinquish our 
pride and dignity at any cost. 
And this is the principle that 
we're teaching our kids. It's a sad 
state of affairs in the world to- 



Online Communities Provide A Home 
Away From Home 



By Said EL-Dajani 

Over the last decade or so, in- 
formation has become accessible 
beyond our wildest dreams. The 
ability to log on to cyber space 
to communicate, shop around, 
or just kill time has brought our 
world a little closer together. Two 
mega-sites that dominate the In- 
ternet with their networks are 
facebook.com and myspace.com. 
While they are both enormous 
entities that provide information 
and communication, their lay- 
outs are completely different, as 
is the intention behind the sites. 
I would like to discuss what each 
site has to offer, and how you, as 
the reader, who may or may not 
be apart of this network, can see 
what each may have for you. 

I personally got involved with 
facebook.com two years ago in 
October, when the phenomenal 
movement swept across my cam- 
pus like wildfire. Even before I 
joined the site, which is accessible 
with a university e-mail address 
(I believe some high schools are 
also a part of the network), groups 
were already established, and my 



friends down the hall had already 
produced their page. It was an at- 
tractive bandwagon to join. I re- 
ally believe that it still is. 
You can create groups on Face- 
book, which allows one to per- 
sonalize a page dedicated to an 
activity, an event, a community, 
or even Steve Irwin - the options 
there are unlimited. Facebook 
also gives people the chance to 
find new friends, lost friends, 
girlfriends and Facebook friends 
within a structured demographi- 
cal setting. 90 percent of Face- 
book's visitors are college stu- 

Facebook also allows members 
to create photo albums. Instead of 
having picture parties like in the 
early ) "I'llls, we can now download 
our pictures straight from our dig- 
ital cameras onto Facebook and 
organize them as we choose. This 
has revolutionized Kodak founder 
George kastman's view on pho- 
tography that everyone can be a 
picture taker Needless to say, the 
majority of pictures on Facebook 
ate of embarrassing drunk mo- 
ments - not much of an art to it. 

On the other hand, Myspace is a 
place for everyone who can han- 



dle facebook times ten. Myspace 
allows people to use coding to 
personalize and customize their 
pages. The site strongly reinforces 
the idea of change, independence, 
and personality. If you are an art- 
ist seeking exposure, posting your 
work would be an excellent way 
to advertise. If you are a musi- 
cian, movie maker, or stripper, 
Myspace, allows you to market 
yourself while building a network 
of people. You find people on 
Myspace looking for opportunity 
or love. Since there are no bound- 
aries preventing people from 
joining, Myspace is a little more 
susceptible to creepy people. 

While these two sites may seem 
,i little loo liberal, they truly define 
the age of information in which 
we live. Whether you are look- 
ing for a relationship, building a 
business, or expressing the artist 
within, Facebook and Myspace 
are mediums with growing capa- 
biliiies (hat can complement your 
lifestyle. Better to join now than 
later, because catching up is a lot 
harder than keeping up. 




Longing for Healthy Food Choices 



By Jenna Tompkins 



The age old question, "what 
is there to eat?" has definitely 
made its way to the IPFW cam- 
pus. When students have a 
break between classes or want 
to get a bite to eat while they are 
on campus, they have three not 
so health-conscious choices and 
one decent alternative. 

Those three high-calorie 
choices are Taco Bell, Pizza 
Hut, and the vending machines. 
Granted, one could probably 
pick something semi-healthy 
from all of them, but the chanc- 
es are likely that one would 
rather opt for the pepperoni 
pizza, the hard taco supreme, or 
a bag of Doritos. Unfortunately, 
these choices are aiding in the 
destruction of the human body. 

In continuation of the poor 
food offerings on campus, the 
free food we are offered as a 
bribe to join a group or to at- 



tend an event is not generally up 
to healthy standards. Usually, it 
is (again!) pizza. More groups 
should try offering cheese, fruit, or 
vegetables. 

Subway, a fairly healthy 
choice, still isn't topping my list 
of places to eat every time 1 am on 
campus. I like variety. Besides, if 
you don't order the daily special, 
then Subway can be a bit on the 
pricey side. 

So, how could IPFW appease 
those cheap health- conscious 
college students? Perhaps IPFW 
could delete the option of Taco 
Bell and Pizza Hut and add a caf- 
eteria that provides a variety of 
selections from comfort food to 
salads and wraps. 

The student body is likely to 
appreciate the choices offered to 
them and will probably utilize this 
option more so than the grease 
soaked pizzas at Pizza Hut.

By Allison Graber

On one night in 1959, a man, 
distinct from other men in his 
country, fled his home in the cover 
of darkness, fearing for his life. He 
has since ruled his country from a 
distance. 

Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai 
Lama of Tibet, has been advocat- 
ing a return to Tibetan indepen- 
dence, out from under Chinese 

Students for a Free Tibet is a 
student group sympathetic to the 
Dalai Lama's cause. With a chapter 
at IPFW, SFT seeks to work in part- 
nership with the Tibetan people to 
regain rule over their country. 

There are over 650 chapters of 
the organization in 30 countries

Conrad ascribes her interest

class. She read about the history 
and was shocked she did not know 

In 1950, China invaded Tibet, 
taking half the country by force. 
40,000 troops remained to keep 
the country secure. 

By 1959, demonstrations erupt- 
ed and thousands were dead by 
the hands of the Chinese govern- 
ment. Tibet is still under Chinese 
authority, while the Dalai Lama 
and the Tibetan government re- 
main in exile in India. 

Hilary Edwards, the organi- 
zation's regional coordinator for 
the midwest, sees SFT as a way for 
students to use their power of free 
speech to promote change. 

SFT organizes workshops and 
conferences across the country as 
well as movie nights and lectures 
on the IPFW campus. 

With a focus on the 2008 
Olympics being held in Beijing, 
SFT hopes to bring attention to Ti- 
bet by boycotting the games. 

"The Olympics are supposed 
to be an event where people come 
throughout the world peacefully. 
It really doesn't seem that China 
has earned the right to do that 
when they don't respect their own 
people," Edwards said. 

People all over the world, in- 
cluding students at IPFW, are still 
addressing the plight of the man 
fleeing in the darkness over 60 
years ago. 

Meetings for SFT are held at 
IPFW twice a month. Informa-

The concert closed with

Being a college student can be 
very stressful at times, especially 
when you have to balance many 
things in life. 

Balancing your schoolwork. 
your job, and really just finding 
time for yourself can be a diffi- 
cult task to overcome. However, 
if your time is managed well, life 
could be a lot less stressful for you 
and the people around you. 

First, make sure that you are 
not putting your schoolwork &lt;iff 
until the very last moment. Ac- 
cording to USA Today, nearly half 
of college students are working 
more than twenty-five hours a 

Working a job can and does af- 
fect how students perform in col- 
lege. Is it worth working all these 

63% of the students polled in 
the USA Today study said, "With- 
out working they could not afford 
college." 

Even though many college stu- 
dents work these long hours, there 
needs to be some kind of sched- 
ule set aside for your schoolwork. 

To help with planning, IPFW 
offers their students the student 
handbook planner. 



By simply writing down what 
you have to do in the future, your 
life will become more organized. 

Working so many hours each 
week cuts into how much time you 
can spend studying, but there are 
always options. 

All that you have to do is sim- 
ply organize these parts of your 
life. 

Organizing is a great way to get 
things done and also helps avoid
