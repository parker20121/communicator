RAGE 2 THE COMMUNICATOR 3/3/77 

Campaigns should be lengthened 



&gt;■ 



&gt; And now students again are facing that decision, which candidate should they 
support to represent their interests? The campaign has barely begun and already 
.one is being confronted with a list of names from which to choose, with little more 
than a sligt idea as to their qualifications. 

The problem with the elections is not the ole' scape goat "apathy". It is not the 

lack of interest in the elections that breeds such a poor turnout at the polls each 

*vear. Rather, it may be the format in which the elect ions are whipped through. 

The deadline for candidates sign-up sheets is less than two weeks before the 

actual election. This provides little time for student to become acquainted with the 

mi'.! ' ulei-. ibis newspaper in its coverage of the elections, thus, 

limitinc the main communications line to the students. 

Why not let the campaigns run a bit longer, say four or five weeks, maybe even 
two months? This certainly would stimulate a more issue-oriented election as well 
as probably a more vital, interesting student government. 
■ Interest may replace non-p;irii(i|Kiti(u] i! llic hi/zincss surrounding many of the 
figures running for office and the guesswork at the polls are allowed, through time,
