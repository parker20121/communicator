The search has begun for a succes- 
sor lo IPFW Chancellor Joanne B. 
Lantz who will be retiring at the end 
of the 1993-94 academic school 



year. 

Purdue President Steven Beering 
recently appointed an 11 member 
search committee. Walter P. 
Hclmkc, chair, and Rebecca A. Tea- 
garden, vice chair of the Communi- 
ty Advisory Council (CAC) have 
been chosen lo head up the commit- 
tee. 

Hclmke, a local attorney, has close 
ties with the university. He has 
served on the CAC for 17 years; has 
taught political science courses on 
campus (at (he invitation of Julius 
Smulkstys, IPFW associate profes- 
sor of political science); and is the 
son of Walter Helmke, one of the 
leading originators and supporters 
of a university for the Fort Wayne 
area 30 years ago, and in whose 
honor the Helmke Library is named. 

Additionally, Hclmkc served on 
the search committee several years 
ago when IPFW Chancellor Wallace 
was picked for the position.

Students tell 
of volunteering 

By Ramona McGowd, 
Chief Reporter 

The IPFW Student Volunteer Ser- 
vice Committee held a symposium 
last Tuesday lo recognize those stu- 
dents who were awarded grants lasi 
year. 

Mary Ball Brant, coordinator of 
student employment, and chair of 
the student volunteer service com- 
mitiee moderatored the symposium. 
She introduced the four student 
grant recipients and allowed each 
student to explain his or her program 



associaled with the university. She 
is a 1980 alumna; a pasi president of 
Ihe IU side or the IPFW Joint Alum- 
ni Board; also a pasl president of the 
Royal "Dons. Her daughter is a 
sophomore at IPFW. 

Both Helmke and Teagarden said 
that the committee will meet within 
the next two weeks with Beering 
and set an agenda. 

"Personally. I would like lo have 
our recommendations ready for 
President Beering by March or 
April," said Helmke. 

"Of course, our recommendations 
to the President and Ihe Purdue 
Board of Trustees are just lhal — 
recommendations." 

Helmke explained that the board 
and the president can accept or re- 
jecl the CAC's recommendations. 

"My desire is to find a clone of 
Joanne Laniz — someone who has 
the best interests of IPFW, Fort 
Wayne, and Northeast Indiana at 
heart," said Teagarden. 

As a member of the search com- 
mittee, Teagarden will soon be offi- 
cially requesting inpui from the 
IPFW Alumni Association Boards 
and iheir respective members (IU 
and Purdue). 



other nine members of the 
search committee are: Scott F. Ar- 
gast, associate professor of geology 
and chair of GcoScienccs; John P. 
Bell, associale professor of history; 
L. Dianne Bezdon, business admin- 
istrator. School of Engineering and 
Technology; Sandra S. Bryant, sec- 
retary, Office of the Dean of Stu- 
dents; Ronald C. Emery, professor 
and chair. Department of Electrical

Mark Oueen, an English major in- 
volved in Transitional Studies, dis- 
cussed his grant that involved assist- 
ing young teenage parents in the 
workforce and to help properly pre- 
pare them for interviews, and how to 
present themselves before their fu- 
lure employers. 

"Not only were Ihe students and 
their peers proud of each other, 1 felt 
a great deal of accomplishment," 
said Queen. 




Chris Barlow, a biology major, pre- 
sented an Earth Day summary. Her 
emphasis was the conservation of 
the earth's resources and ihe need lo 
increase awareness through using 
entertainment as a learning tool. 

Chris Douse, president of the 
Black Collegian Caucus, explained 
how funds would be used lo help un- 
derprivileged students that normally 
would not feel as though college was 
an approachable goal. 
"Students arc given counseling on 
the proper preparation for college 
and the lools needed to endure and 
atlain successfully a degree," said 
Douse. 

Louise Duguid, a double major in 
women's studies and sociology was 
involved with the Center for Women 
and Reluming Adults. This program 
lends lo focus on persons who arc 
struggling with the idea of re-enter- 
ing Ihe academia scene and helps 
those adults returning to school as-

Weekend college instructor 
shares insights of school 



By JoAnn Steinforth, 
Features Editor 
Marilyn M. Shannon, M.A., has 
been teaching weekend college as a 
specially for 10 years al IPFW. As a 
visiting instruelor of biology, she 
leaches Human Anatomy and Physi- 
ology 203 and 204 in a two semester 

For the first five years, she conduct- 
ed class on Saturday mornings from 8 
a.m. lo noon. When she realized that 
she was a night person, she moved 
her classes to Friday evenings from 6 
to 10 p.m. 

"This suited my biological rhythm 
better, and apparently, (here are a lot 
of night people in my classes, as the 
class is closed every semester," said 
Shannon. 

Shannon instituted a policy for her 
students' safely. She requires them to 
all park in the same parking lot on 
Friday nights. The university is fairly 
deserted at lhal (ime, so parking 
spaces are readily available to ensure 
everyone's safety. 

"I require that so no one is wander- 
ing around laic a( night or leaving for 
home alone," she added. 

Weekend classes have generated 
some funny stories. One evening, 
Shannon was discussing Ihe elasticity 
of the skin. She lold them lhal as one 
ages, the skin doesn't spring back as 
well as in younger days. 

"An older gentleman (ried this, and 
his skin didn't spring hack, so he slat- 
ed, Til be your next cadaver'." 

Not missing a step, Shannon 
quipped, "Well, we need one right 

Before coming to IPFW, she laughl 



at Alvemo College, a small women's 
school in Milwaukee. Shannon's 
overall feeling is that weekend col- 
lege is like a small college. 

"A small class allows more person- 
al attention to each student's ques- 
tions," said Shannon. "Students who 
attend weekend college lend to be 
non-traditional."

Sometimes at Ihe end of the semes- 
ter. Shannon and her students will go 
for pizza. And sometimes, the stu- 
dents will do nice things for their pro- 
fessor. When she was pregnant with 
her fifth child al the end of one se- 
mester, the students brought Shannon 
a pink cake with a rattle on lop. Evi- 
dently, she had let il leak that she 
wanted a girl. And she delivered 3 
girl. 

It is interesting to note that Shannon 
is pregnant with her sixth child. 

Another anecdole Shannon shared 
is in regard to Ihe fact that none of 
the lab lechnicians are ever around al 



a late hour. 

"We were dissecting hearts. I 
showed a videolape of how to dissccl 
the heart. When it was over, 1 went to 
gel the hearis for 24 students, but 
they weren'i where they were sup- 
posed to be. I looked in all of the ob- 
vious places. So, I found the lech and 
he had put the hearts in another 
place, 1 ' said Shannon. 

Another student that had enrolled in 
Shannon's class was Dennis Beech- 
ing. He is a sophomore enrolled in 
Pre-nursing. 

"The advantages of weekend col- 
lege is that it gives a full-time worker 
time lo study Ihe material from one 
week lo the next. This can work inio 
their busy schedules," said Beeehing. 

"The disadvantages of meeting once 
a week is that you might not have as 
much contact with your instructor," 
he added.

Peace and Conflict in 
Life 201 : A Commentary 



By Felicia Beeching, 
Editor in chief 

Ate you laking the class Life 
!01 this semester? I hope so, and 
when you pass, I have good news 
for you---there's Life 201 to pass, 
too. 

What is Life 201? In my thirty- 
something years of living, 1 think 
it's an ongoing process of sorting 
out what is truly important to live 
life at the fullest. It's learning 
how lo balance peace and conflict 
with olhers, learning lo compro- 
mise when one needs be to (in- 
cludes lough words like 'I'm sor- 
ry'), and learning how to say 'no' 
when needed, loo. 

This week has been tough. I've 
done all of the above in the last 
24 hours. It reminds me of the 
ihrce peace and conflict studies 
classes I've taken on campus with 
Professor Richard Johnson. 

We studied how conflicts esca- 
lale inlo wars. It starts with just 
two people unable to resolve a 
conflict, and instead of each say- 
ing, 'okay, let's do what's best for 
both of us,' (this eliminates 
bloodshed), communicaiion 
breaks down. 

Sometimes that means being 
helpless to do anything about it, 
but being guided by the principle 
of every human being (because 
each of us is made in the image of 
God) has worth, and we must 
treat olhers wilh respect. This was 
the principle behind the non-vio- 
lent resislance movement of 
Gandhi, and laler, Martin Luiher 
King, Jr. That's all greal theory, 
right? We started to practically 
apply it. 

For example, we had a neighbor 
who didn't like the shade of my 
skin. We put up a fence between 
his backyard and our backyard. 
Then we didn't have to look at his 
trash-filled yard and he didn't 
have to look at me and my brown 
children. Compromise, applied. 

Bill,' he decided to start throwing 
his empty beer bottles across the 
fence and smashing them on our 
sidewalk and calling our children 
racially inappropriate names. I 
told ray kids lo ignore the guy 
since he spent half of his life 
drunk; his faculties were im- 
paired; and we could practice 
peace instead of sinking to his 
level and choosing some juicy ad- 
jectives for his cars to hear. And I 
just swept up the glass. Peace, ap- 
plied. 

Bui our neighbor wasn't satis- 
fied. He began threatening to 
shoot us unless we moved out of 
town (We live in Huntington.). A 
drunk man with a gun is a scary 
'neighbor' to live next door. One 
morning he appeared to be stalk- 
ing my house. I went outside and 
stood on the porch, while he 
glared at me on the sidewalk in 
front of our house. 

In my most polite voice I asked, 
"May 1 help you wilh some- 
thing?" 

(Actually my kids needed to go 



lo school and they were too 
scared to come outside with him 
out iherc, and my husband had 
just left 15 minuies before.) 

He became just like a bottle of 
uncorked champagne. He let out a 
tirade of words and began acling 
like a madman. I told him to go 
home or I would call the police. 
He kept ranting and raving, so 
that's what I did. 

When the policeman arrived, the 
guy was still carrying on about 
killing all of us unless we moved 
out of town. He told the police he 
would definitely kill us soon. The 
policeman said he would arrest 
him if he didn't shut up, so finally 
the guy calmed down somewhat 
and staggered home. 

Calling the police was my way 
of finally telling my neighbor. 
'No, I won'l pui up with your ha- 
rassment anymore. I will call the 
police on you if needed.' 

To be truthful, I was really 
scared and shaken because I am 
lerrified of guns. I am afraid if 
anyone mentions shooting anoihcr 
human being, and I am unable lo 
handle watching violence on TV 
or videos. I realize my fear goes 
beyond safely and into the irra- 
tional. 

Unbelievably, within the month, 
our 'neighbor' moved. I heard 
that he moved out of (own— prob- 
ably to some safe neighborhood 
for him like Andrews or Bippus, 
Indiana. (No offense to the people 
in those places; I'm making a 
point.) 

As I think back on this incident 
from last summer, maybe this 
man was also moiivaicd by an ir- 
rational fear. He probably never 
came in contact wilh people from 
anyplace but Huntington, and al- 
though we were more than happy 
to ignore him, our presence made 
him have to deal with his irra- 
tional fear of living next to people 
he perceived as different from 
him. (And his gun threats made 
me deal wilh my irrational fear.) 

Isn't that often the way it is in 
Life 201? We are forced to face 
our fear of the unknown, whether 
it's guns, ihose of differing races, 
religions, gender, sexual orienta- 
tion, political view, or a multitude 
of other things. You fill in your 
own blank. 

How do we pass Life 201? First 
of all, I don't think ihere is a 
graduation day for this class. The 
skills you and I learn from this 
class are vocational and accumu- 
lative. Secondly, because they are 
vocational in nature, positively 
dealing wilh conflict and promot- 
ing peace are teachable skills. 
Thirdly, when the other two ideas 
lake root, a character change will 
begin inside each one of us. Do 
you remember that I said thai a 
war begins with Iwo people in un- 
solvable conflict and escalates 
from there? Maybe peace will 
prevail when each of us become 
willing to learn what's laught in 
Life 201.

if " 




Dear Auni Louise, 
Well, I admit it- 1 jus! love to play Ihc 

Lately, though, it's kinda been gelling 
out of hand- you know what I mcan- 
lollery tickets instead of lunch, and all 
lhal. 

What should 1 do? 

Yours, 
Can'i Stop 
DearCan'l Stop, 

Honey, this is kind of Funny because 1 
have Ihc same problem with bingo. I 
just love to play that game all of the 
time. 1 tell you, on a Saturday night you 
can catch me ai church playing bingo. 
Of course sve never play for big money 
like at some places. 

Whai you need lo do is pui yourself on 
a budget. Dearie, once you have lhal es- 



tablished, make sure you set aside mon- 
ey for yourself and spend il anyway. 

I would not advise you to buy a ticket 
instead of ealing. We all know what the 
odds are of somebody actually winning 
the lollery. However, if you do, remem- 
ber me? 

Your loving Aunt Louise 
Dear Aunl Louise, 

I have asked a friend to type this (or 
mc and to lell you what my problem is. 

I don't really know how I gol ihis far 
in school. I am a sophomore and I am 
really having trouble understanding 
what I am reading. I know I don'l read 
so good, and it lakes me a really long 
lime. I am afraid lhal 1 am going to gel 
caught. 

What should I do'. 1 I am really worried 
that someone, like my professors will 
find oul lhal I never learned to read very 

I don't wanl you to know who I am, so 
please answer in the paper. I read your 
column every week. Thanks. 

Sincerely, 
In Trouble 
Dear In Trouble, 

Thank you for reading my column 
every week. It's nice lo know 1 have 
fans. Now, your problem seems lo be a 

What you need lo do firsl is accept the 
fact that you gol to where you arc be- 
cause you worked hard. Lambchop, 
there is nothing wrong wilh having to 
work hard for what you have and laking 
the credit for it. So, you need to pat 
yourself on ihc back. 

The ncxi thing you need lo do is real- 
ize lhal Iherc is nothing wrong wilh gel- 



ling help. If you're frightened about the 
professor finding out, maybe you need 
to go and talk lo your professor. Profes- 
sors arc here to help students and 1 
know there are some undersianding 
ones on this campus. 

You also might want to check wilh 
Randy Borst. He's director of services 
for students wilh di.sablitics on on cam- 
pus. They can do some testing to see if 
you have a learning disability. The uni- 
versity can supply you wilh all types of 
aid if you need extra help. 

The lasi thing, 1 want you to do is get- 
ling your head oul of Ihc cow chips. It's 
nol thai had. Becoming depressed over 
something like this will make the situa- 
tion wotse, what you need lo do is cither 
go lo your prof, as I was talkin' about 
before, or gel a luior. Bui, you need to 
believe in yourself first. You arc only 
limited by your own thoughts and opin- 

Your Loving Aunt Louise 
Dear Aunt Louise, 

I jusl saw your column about ihc high 
school girl who is dating a college man, 
and 1 decided lo wrilc because I have a 
similar situation. 

II seems lhal my brother's sixteen- 
ycar-old hcsl friend has a crush on me (I 
am a junior at IPFW), and he just won't 
leave mc alone. He is over lo our house 
all (he time, and he follows mc wherev- 
er I go. Like, I have lo tell him not to 
come wilh mc because I want to use Ihc 
bathroom! 

I doo'i want to hurl his feelings, bui he 
is coming on stronger and stronger. I'm 
Haltered, but we really don't have any- 
Ihine in common. 



Any advise as to how lo let him down 

Yours truly, 
Not Interested 
Dear Not Interested, 

Child, you have it bad, don'l you? 
Well, you can do several things: lell him 
how you feel truthfully or you can ig- 

I would urge you nol to ignore it be- 
cause it could be a case of hormones or 

I strongly urge you nol lo lell your 
brother because he really doesn't need 
lo know in the first place. If he knows, 
he has the chance of letting it slip in 
front of his friend. That action could 
make young kid angry. You need lo con- 
sider his feelings, okay, sweetie? 

You need lo (ell him that you arc nol 
interested in him because of his age. 
Then he will think it's because of some- 
thing he can'l conlrol. Who can control 
age? I'm sixly-fivc and holding! Il is 
important lhat you do let Ihe young lad 
understand that you don'l have a prob- 
lem with being friends. 

This could end up being a big mess by 
Ihe lime il is finished. I think ihc only 
way to really handle il, is if you talk to 
Ihc young feller yourself, even though 
he is irying lo court you, I remember 
when my Dorcus was courting mc, he 
would come lo ihc door and ask my fa- 
ther if he could take mc out. Pappy 
would say yes and we would take long 
romantic walks to Ihe ice cream parlor. 
Dorcus was so sweet back then-as he is 

Remember, honesty is the best policy. 
Your loving Aunt Louise

Well, I ihink you need to know thai 
according lo an article written by Ellen 
Goodman, of Ihe Boston Globe, and 
reprinted in ihe Sept. 27th Journal 
Gazelle, students need to slop, think, 
act, and review when il comes down lo 
consensual sexual relations on or off 
campus. 

Let's examine this issue of a sexual re- 
lations. It all boils down to one word: 
consent. Goodman says consent is " . . . 
nol something to be assumed, ... is not 
silence, . . . [is] not ihe absence of a 
'no.'" I believe ihis definition is as clear 
as Paul Newman's sleel blue eyes, how- 
ever, is il realistic lo college students? 

Il should be, bui it isn't. 

As college students, I am sure wc have

fashion magazines, relishing the irony 
of rich jetscltcrs spending thousands to 
look "grungy." I don't know much

saving proofs of purchases towards a 
Krafi Macaroni and Cheese "Checza-

the most interesting magazine was 



Vogue, a phone book-sized tribute lo

Vogue, it appears, is ihe fashion pulpit 
from which Ihe indisputable decrees of 
style arc issued. Like a corrupt religion, 
the high pontiff Vogue and its fashion 
acolytes sap wealth and power from ils 
followers by bludgeoning their self es- 
teem. Readers run a gauntlet of adver- 
tisements displaying this year's one and 
only acceptable female body type: tall. 
leen-aged and "waif-like." So Far, fash- 
replacing the 1980's tall, (bin. while and

most elusive body frame, designers 
have allackcd the insecurities of Ihe ma- 
jority of women. And an insecure con- 
sumer is a good consumer. Hail Mary, 
praise Vogue. 

As for Ihc actual styles lhal women are 
supposed lo wear now, I'm a bil con- 
fused. The only impression I gol is lhal 
you're supposed lo dress like a Prussian 
drum major. And wear big, fuzzy hais. 



I almost forgot the big. fuzzy hats. Nol 
surprisingly, men aren't immune from 
this sham anymore. As we progress to-

Notes from Room (J47 



by F. Lane Douse, 

Managing Editor 

Well. I'm back in class for now. I 

missed a day last week, voluntarily. And 
folks, I think you need to know, I am a 
remedial math student. As are other peo- 
ple in my class. So, I had to do those 
math tutorials. What can I say? 

I hate them! 

A friend of mine just passed and 
waved "hello!" 

What's up. girlfriend! 

Quadratic equations are next. Now, I 
like that stuff! 

Test is September 27th. Man. that's 
some crap. I gotta study. 

Sure. I got a C out of Ma 111, but. this 



really confusing — I need to know 
how to complete a square- the hell out 
of me. My prof is a cool guy, but I'm' 
confused. 

Note Break 

I haic people who understand algebra. 
How is finding out how long a 500 hun- 
dred pound bomb will lake to drop go- 
ing lo help me in my field? Hold up, 
we're finding out how far the plane is 
going. Can't miss that important detail. 

Moving on more important topics like, 
the Pylhagorcan theorem. 

Damn, another airplane problem! 

1 learned how to get the quadratic 
mula, neat!

Is it a cold 
or is it the 
flu? 



Cold Symptoms 

Contrary to popular belief, colds ore nor caused by getting chilled 

in cold weather. Most colds occur in winter months Because 

people spend more lime indoors, where the cold viruses are easily 

spread. 

Colds develop slowly, over 1 8 to 48 hours. Symptoms include: 

• scrotchy, sore throat • runny nose • watery / itchy eyes 

• sneezing or coughing • general fatigue. The worst symptoms 
will lost A to 5 days, completely disappearing after 10 days. 

Flu Symptoms 

A flu develops rapidly and packs a much harder punch than a 

cold. The primary symptoms are: • weakness • muscle aches 

• chills • headaches • severe sore throat • coughing • stuffy 
nose. The cold-like effects will dear up after 3 to 4 days, however, 
the feeling of fatigue or weakness can continue for days or weeks 
afterword 

Cold &amp; Flu Treatment 

• Get lots of bed rest. 

• Drink plenty of liquids [Water, fruit juices.) 

• Take pain relievers for the aches, [NOTE: because ospirin has 
been linked to Reye's Syndrome, give children only non-ospirin 
pain relievers.) 

• Use a vaporizer to ease congestion. 

• Take throat lozenges to soolhe your scrotchy throat. 
And remember... 

There's a Medi-I-Quick just minutes from campus. So if you're 
feeling terrible, we're here to help!

AIDS Awareness 
Scholarship Available 




Sebastian und Follett's Bookstore offer $S student pack. 



By Aimce WicklifT 
Staff Writer 

Sebastian International, a leading 
beauty care company, has recently 
embarked upon a major endeavor to 
provide AIDS education to over 400 
college campuses throughout the 
United States. 

Sebastian, supported by the Inter 
Association Task Force, is a coali- 
tion of national college organiza- 
tions and the National Community 
of AIDS Partnership (NCAP), an or- 
ganization devoted to AIDS aware- 
ness and prevention that has been 
working to increase student aware- 
ness and responsibility toward this 
deadly disease and to raise $350,000 
lo fund Heart Strings 101, an AIDS 
Awareness Musical on college lour. 

Beginning this fall and continuing 
for a minimum of three terms, 
HIV/AIDS awareness scholarships 
will be available to students in all 
fields of study. 

To raise money for this special 
tour, Sebastian will be selling stu- 
dent sample packs of their products 
in Follett's bookstores across the 
country. A portion of the proceeds 
will go towards funding the Heart 
Strings 101. 

For the student price of $5, stu- 
dents can purchase a pack contain- 
ing three Sebastian products: Cel- 
loshampoof©), Sheen instant condi- 
tioner and Wet (©) liquid styling 
gel. Each purchase includes a SI do- 
nation to NCAP. Students are en- 
couraged to visit local Sebastion 
College Salons for brochures outlin- 
ing application details. 

"To wage an effective fight against 
this epidemic is going to lake an 



student organizations, and most of 
all, very special companies such as 
Sebastian and Follett's," said Paula 
Van Ness, executive director, 
NCAP. 

Oilier fundraisers include "health 
and fitness" days at local salons, 
movie premieres, and fashion and 
beauty seminars. 

In an effort to get students in- 
volved, Sebaslion and Follett's 
bookstores will be sponsoring an 
AIDS awareness scholarship, worth 
$1,000.00 to 30 students who pre- 
sent original ideas to help prevent 
the spread of HIV. 

Sebastian and Follett's believe that 
awareness will be raised through 
these scholarships. 

Applicants may use any method 
that best communicates their idea, 
such as a commercial, song, paint- 
ing, board games, logo, or market- 
ing plan. 

NCAP is working on college cam- 
puses across the country to imple- 
ment AIDs programs. They provid- 
ed these startling statistics: 

Since 1983, nearly 9,000 
HIV/AIDS cases have been reported 
among 13-24 year olds. 

Approximately 5,000 children and 
young adults have died of AIDS 
since 1981. 

HIV/AIDS infection among stu- 
dent age populations has increased 
nearly 80% in the last two years. 

Less than 5% of the total federal 
AIDS budget is spent on treatment 
and prevention of AIDS in the youth 
population. 

Future programs will include 
"movie premiere" nights, fashion 
and beauty seminars with student 
organizations to raise other monies. 



Grunge 
Rock Review 



By Bruce W. Anderson, 
Production Manager 

This is (he album your friend 
bought, said you would like, and 
then could not describe lo you. 
This is the album some will rave 
about, others will bash needlessly 
and others will appreciate quietly 
as an "interesting-if pretentious- 
debut." 

I Mother Earth's first album, 
"Dig," is a seemingly odd blend of 
rock-n-roll, psychedelia and of all 
things, grunge. While the lyrics 
are a bit hard to follow, there is no 
mistaking the drive and power of 
the music itself. 

The only complaint is the lyrical 
content. It seems murky and in- 
comprehensible at first, though re- 
peated listening can unlock its un- 
derstanding. But that is part of the 
beauty of this band: they do not re- 
ly on only their lyrics. It is already 
great music; the lyrics seem al- 
most incidental. 

For the average listener this band 
may be a bit much. Much as I hate 
to agree with the record compa- 
ny's PR robots, this band does not 
adhere to cliches and makes other 
bands seem ordinary by compari- 
son. Much as I liked "Living on 
the Edge," 1 would still rather hear 
"Levitate" or "Rain Will Fall." 
But I am the one who would rather 
hear the Cowboy Junkies than 
Guns-n-Roses. As lime goes by, 
though, this band will grow on 

Hailing from Canada, you might 
expect to hear a band heavily in- 
fluenced by the likes of Rush, Tri- 
umph and our good friend Neil 
Young, and indeed, these bands' 



Classical Spanish dancers 



By Jo Ann Stein forth 
Features Editor 

Classical and flamenco dances of 
Spain were presented Saturday, Sept. 
25 in Neff Recital Hall at 7:30 p.m. 
by Pascual Olivcra and Angela del 
Moral. 

The pair choreographed works 
from "Carmen" as well as perform- 
ing the Rhumba Flamenco, the 
Moorish Gypsy Dance and a Basque 

Pascual Olivera has studied fla- 
menco dancing since the age of 13 
and has appeared with Jose Greco's 
dance company as a soloist in the 
Royal Festival Hall in London. 

In addition, Jose Greco created the 
ballet, "The Adventures of Don 
Quixote" for this gifted dancer. 

Angela del Moral has danced pro- 
fessionally since the age of three. 
She studied dance, drama and piano 
at the Conscrvatorio del Musica y 
Declamation. When she was 13, the 
Spanish government sent her to Italy 
where she won first prize at the In- 
ternational Dance Competitions. 

The couple met in Madrid and 
have been married since 1976. They 
have danced together in perfor- 
mances with the Chicago Symphony, 
Minnesota Orchestra. Baltimore 
Symphony, Buffalo Philharmonic 
and the Cincinnati Pops. 

This event was sponsored by His- 
panos Unidos, Multicultural and 
Special Services, the School of Fine 
and Performing Arts, and 1PSGA.

The Communicator 



Boy teams 
up with cops 

By Jennifer Murray 
Staff Writer 

Don'l you just hale il when Holly- 
wood tries to keep an aging actor or 
actress young? 

Those of you who ventured far 
enough into the Communicator last 
week and actually read my movie re- 
view on '"In the Line of Fire," may 
recall my expressed pleasure at how 
Clint Eastwood was portrayed as 
what he is, an aged man. Nothing 
wrong with an aged man. Right? It is 
my own personal opinion that men 
age more gracefully than women. 

Well, il seems as though Burt 
Reynolds will have none of that. 
Those of you that stuck around last 
Wednesday night to watch "Cop and 
a HalF' in Classroom Medical may 
agree. Those loyal Burl Reynolds 
fans who do nol, belter quit reading, 
cause I'm getting ready lo blast the 
guy- 
Okay, plot: Cute, little eight year 
old boy (Norman Golden II) wit- 
nesses murder by the mob, with- 
holds information from police until 
they agree to let him learn up with 
fantasy cop Nick McKcnna (a.k.a. 
Burt Reynolds). 

Fantasy cop nol agreeable with 
arrangement, (sems to hate kids). 
They team up anyway. The bad guy 
(Ray Sharky) tries lo gel the boy. 
Nick saves the boy. A father and son 
relationship ensues. Guns arc fired. 
Boats get crashed. The bad guys get 
caught. The end. Everything you 
would expect in a Burt Reynolds 
movie and less. 

All right, I understand that maybe 
ils not geared towards adults, but 
even my kids were asking when we 
could go. 

Now, ils not that 1 hate Burt 
Reynolds (although have you read 
the latest Star Magazine?). The guy 
is not ihirty-somelhing anymore, and 
he should nol be running around in 
cowboy boois, smashing guys that 
are half his age and squealing his 
tires. 

He needs to act his age. I mean 
geez, his hair looked like something 
you would order out of a catalogue. I 
would like to see some gray. I am 
sure it must be there. 

This movie was okay if you hap- 
pen lo be a boy between the ages of 
eight and ten with a Miami Vice 
fetish, otherwise, I would suggest to 
those of you who were lucky enough 
to have missed it last week, to save 
your two bucks and not rent it when 
il comes out on video.

Experts Give Health Tips 



By Jo Ann Steinforth, 

Features Editor and 

Carrie Jo Combs, 

Staff Writer 

Between work, school, family and 
a social life, every college student 
endures a stressful period at least 
one point in his or her academic life. 
With these intense times, students 
must learn to deal with or avoid 
stress. 

There is a new approach lo chang- 
ing one's lifestyle lo combat stress, 
it is what is known as a wholistic 
approach lo living. 

Practitioners in the field of wholis- 
tic living want people lo learn how 
lo control their lifestyles by first 
wanting to make a change in their 
lives and be ready lo do ihe work. 

"You have to let your subconsious 
mind take over, then you can move 
past your limitations, said Jeanne 
Shoup, director of Vital Living. 

"Take responsibilities on all levels 
of your life. Practicing a wholistic 
approach will make people aware of 
their options," said Shoup. 

Other professionals in the field of 
wholistic living advise that your 
consciousness may hide what you 
are, but your subconsious mind re- 
veals the true self. To live under Ihe 
commands of the subconsious mind 
means to live in your past failures, 
defeals and pain; to be asleep. To 
live from the conscious mind means 
freedom. 

Begin to observe yourself each day 
and you will gradually become 
aware of how much excess baggage 
you carry in old negative patterns of 
thinking, feeling and acting. 

"When our conscious ideas, 
dreams, or visions don'l actualize in 
our lives, it's because our subcon- 
scious mind is in charge," said 
Shoup. 

The tips experis advice is to ob- 
serve yourself. Take lime for media- 
lion and daily reflection. When you 
find you are off-course, refocus and 
make (he necessary changes. 

Sophomore Rachel Heslermann, a 
computer science and mathematics 
major, has her own lips for dealing 
with stress. 

"1 organize my schedule belter by 
writing things down, making lists, 
and allocating time for each thing I 
have to gel done. I never try to do 
things when I'm tired. I'll take a 
break, or. if necessary, a nap. It's 



useless lo put myself in a non-pro- 
ductive situation. Also, laughing 
and smiling at the world always 
helps," said Heslermann. 

Stephanie Combs, a senior psy- 
chology major, has a totally differ- 
enl approach for coping with a tight 
agenda. 

"I gel on my bike and just ride. I 
may call a friend, or, I'll just go do 
something fun and forget about it all 
for a white," said Combs. 

Other students channel their stress 
toward creative and productive ac- 
tivities. 

Debbie Deere, a junior psychology 
major, lakes walks or plays her pi- 
ano and Bute. 

Senior Deanna Kolbow, also a psy- 
chology major finds other ways of 
fighting stress. 

"I'll go work out at the gym or 
walk my dog," said Kolbow. 

Ways to combat stress no longer 
include long walks or bicycling. 

Other preventive health measures 
include Iridology, which is the sci- 
ence and study of the iris. This re- 
search was brought to (his country 
in the 1900s. For nearly 40 years, 
the Mayo Clinc had an iridologisi 
on staff until he recently retired. Old 
time country doctors used lo prac- 
tice this method of studying the col- 
ored part of patient's eyes to define 
their weaknesses and strengths. As 
an example, hydrocloric acid (diges- 
tion) in the stomach can be defined 
through the iris. 

Reflexogy is the study of organs 
and glands which arc located in the 
bottom of our feel. The use of mas- 
sage on Ihe botlom of a foot, can 
help lo normalize organs and other 
glands of the body. 

Aroma therapy offers iherapeutic 
action against stress. Aroma therapy 
has two primary modes of action. 
Inhalalion-the nerves involved with 
the sense of small go directly into 
the mid-brain and Absorption-essen- 
tial oils diffuse ihroughi Ihe skin in- 
to the tissues and circulatory sys- 
tem. 

Used in skin care, it rcjuvcnlales, 
heals and also helps in cell regener- 
ation. 

And of course, there is always vit- 
amin therapy. Il does work. Vilamin 
B Complex is specifically geared to- 
ward combating stress and calming 
the nerves while taking those all loo 
frequent, stressful, exams.

Joint Initiative Protects Russia's Biological Diversity 



In an urgent new initiative. World 
Wildlife Fund (WWF) is assisting 
ihc Russian government and the So- 
cio-Ecological Union, an associa- 
tion of Russian grassroots organiza- 
tions, to develop a comprehensive 
plan aimed at protecting Russia's 
biological diversity and vast natural 
ecosystems. 

Although Russia possesses one of 
the largest systems of protected ar- 
eas in the world, the turmoil in post- 
Soviet economy and politics lias 
placed these natural treasures in se- 
rious jeopardy. 

Russia's system of strict nature re- 
serves, known as Zapovedniki, har- 
bors nearly two-thirds of Russia's 
threatened species, including the 
Siberian tiger, Anatolian leopard, 
and the musk deer. 

Many of the protected areas con- 
tain important nesting habitat for di- 
verse bird species, such as the spec- 
tacled and king ciders, parakeet 
auklct, red-breasted goose, Siberian 
ruby-throat, Stellers' sea eagle, and 
the rare spoon-billed sandpiper and 
Siberian crane. 

"In many ways, Russia presents 
the best opportunities to conserve 
vast tracts of contiguous wildlife 
habitat," says Eric Dinerstein, who 
directs WWF's Conservation Sci- 
ence Program. 

"The large size of a number of the 
reserves, as well as the substantially 
undeveloped state of many non-pro- 
tected areas, offers the potential for 
conservation of territories large 
enough to allow ecological process- 
es and wildlife populations to fluc- 
tuate naturally," said Dinerstein. 

Unfortunately, events of the past 
few years now present two broad 
threats. The first, which has resulted 
from the political fragmentation, is 
the diminished management capaci- 
ty of traditional institutions. 

The second, brought about by the 
crumbling of local economies, is a 
growing demand for rapid exploita- 
tion of important natural resources, 
such as minerals and timber. 

Incidents of poaching, logging, 
grazing, and commercial fishiny in 
protected areas have dramatically 
increased in the past two years. 
Assessing Threats to BiLilnpic.il Di- 
versity 

As the first phase of the current 
-_ initiative, WWF has been working 
with Russian experts to identify 
Russia's primary areas of biological 
diversity and determine how (hey 
relate to the existing protected area 
system. 

A portfolio of integrated projects 
is now near completion and will be 
offered to organizations such as the 
World Bank, European donor agen- 
cies, and other potential donors. 

During this initial phase, WWF 
staff conducted workshops in Rus- 
sia to identify priority projects. 

Much of the work was based on 
comprehensive research generated 
by the world-class scientists associ- 
ated with the Zapovedniki system. 
Unlike U.S. national parks and 
forests, these reserves were created 
strictly for species preservation and 
scientific research, without designa- 
tion for tourism or commercial use. 

A key consideration for WWF has 
been identifying 13 to IS "bio-re- 
gions" on which the projects should 
focus. Rather than focusing on only 
a few areas, this bio-regional ap- 
proach was taken to ensure that rep- 
resentative samples of all biological 
categories are included, from arlic 
tundra to central-Asian deserts. 

According to WWF Conservation 
Scientist David Olson, li The bio-re- 
gional approach integrates a wide 
range of activities, such as reserve 
management, designation of new 
protected areas, training programs, 
and breeding centers into a compre- 
hensive conservation strategy tai- 
lored to the particular needs of each 
bio-region.

lets us address important conserva- 
tion issues ai the landscape level. 
such as how the spatial arrangement 
of conservation areas and land-use 
in adjacent areas affects species 
populations and ecosystem dynam- 
ics." 

Implementing a 
Lon g-Term Strateg y 

The conservation plan WWF is 
helping the Russians develop also 
considers a number of other factors, 
including the success potential, rela- 
tive threats, and the cost-effective- 
ness of conservation investments. 

In addition to addressing immedi- 
ate needs, the plan involves longer- 
term strategies such as tourism po- 
tential and the sustainable use of 
natural resources. 

In addition, several groups have 
been enthusiastic about establishing 
a framework for a conservation trust 
fund, an innovative funding strategy 
that WWF helped create to promote 



conservation in Costa Rica, the 
Philippines, and Bhutan. 

The plan also considers the needs 
of species of special concern that 
might not be adequately covered 
throughout the bio-regional ap- 
proach, 

"For example, a species-specific 
response might be necessary to en- 
sure that migratory species such as 
cranes and Saiga antelopes are pro- 
tected throughout their migratory 
routes or for those that face intense 
poaching, such as Siberian tigers," 
said Dinerstein. 

The initiative's second phase will 
mark (he introduction of a long- 
term conservation strategy for the 
region, including the actual imple- 
mentation of the projects WWF 
helped develop. 

WWF anticipates that the great 
majority of the work will be done in 
Russia by Russian experts, with 
WWF offering technical and finan- 



Russia's Great Arctic Reserve 




The diverse ecosystems of the Great Arctic Reserve teem with 
wildlife, like these nalruses. 



In early May, Russia set aside 
10 million acres oHls vast Arctic 
wilderness in the Taymyr Penin- 
sula, along the northern 
Siberian coast, as its largest 
strictly protected area. This 
area, about the size of Switzer- 
land, is the Great Arctic Reserve. 

The proposal for the Reserve 
was jointly conceived by the 
Russian Academy of Sciences 
and WWF. (WWF International 
in Switzerland, as well as sev- 
eral WWF National Organiza- 






'C-lVI 



ration for a 

number of years.) The idea first 
took root four years ago when a 
biological expedition of the In- 
stitute for Evolutionary Mor- 
phology and Animal Ecology of 
the Russian Academy of Sci- 
ences and WWF visited north- 
ern Taymyr. 

The scientists were struck by 
the geological splendor of this 
unique and surprisingly varied 
environment. They saw the vast 
Arctic tundra, forest tundra, 
desert, and the many river 
deltas and lakes as treasures 
worthy of special protection. 

Seals and walruses share the 
fish in icy coastal waters with 
polar bears. Inland, the largest 
free-ranging herds of reindeer 
in the world — numbering some 
700,000— grnze-on the flat, 
moss-covered tundra along with 
reintroduced musk oxen. 

Perhaps the greatest impor- 
tance of the Taymyr is as the 
northernmost source of the mi- 
gratory bird flyways of the entire 



world. In the short Arctic sum- 
mer, the Taymyr is alive to the 

birds — sandpipers, plovers, gulls, 
terns, skuas, ducks, and geese — 
busily hatching their young. The 
turnstone, snowy owl, ptarmi- 
gan, and Lapland bunting also 
nest here. Over 150 species of 
birds have been recorded in the 
Taymyr, including the endan- 
gered red-breasted goose, which 
today nests only in this region. 

There is strong local support 
for the Great Arctic Reserve. 
The region is sparsely popu- 
lated, with no more than about 
15,000 people living there. In 
recent years, they have seen the 
wildlife on which they depend 
suffer from the growing on- 
slaught of hunters with their 
helicopters, motor boats, and 



and 1 



, hun 



methods. In additic 
large deposits of valuable met- 
als, coal, oil, and natural gas ex- 
pose it to the threat of uncon- 
trolled industrialization, 

"The indigenous people's life- 
styles are marked by respect for 
the natural rhythms of the ecol- 
ogy of the area," soys Dr. Peter 
Prokosch, coordinator of the 
WWF Arctic Program. "They 
value nature and do not want to 
see it destroyed by the kind of 
pollution that has nffected natu- 
ral habitats further south 
around the industrial city of No- 
ril'sk. Now, at least the northern 
Taymyr region has been spared 
o similar fate with the creation 
of the Great Arctic Reserve."

assistance WWF may take the 
lead, however, in specific projects 
that fit in well with its priorities. 

In the Russian Far East, for exam- 
ple, WWF is seeking to address im- 
mediate and long-term threats to 
Siberian tigers and Amur leopards, 
as well as to native peoples, such as 
the Udegei of the Bikin Valley. 

To address immediate tiger poach- 
ing threats, WWF is planning to or- 
ganize an anii-poaching network 
and reward system for exposing 
poachers. 

Over the long-ierm, WWF will 
help to develop a regional tiger con- 
servation strategy integrating con- 
servation of critical wildlife habitat, 
logging activities, and other forms 
of development. 

Finally, WWF will work with the 
Udegei to explore how the goals of 
wildlife habitat conservation and lo- 
cal income generation can be har- 
monious. 

"The biological value of Russia's 
wilderness is really so immense that 
protecting it truly has international 
implications," said Dinerstein. 

By playing a role in this encour- 
age example of international coop- 
eration in conservation, WWF 
hopes to help preserve this treasure 
for future generations.

The women's volleyball learn con- 
tinues to slrugglc after 14 matches 
inlo the season. Their overall record 
outside of the GLVC was 3-10 rank- 
ing them 7th in the conference. They 
were also defeated by Ashland Uni- 
versity giving them their first GLVC 
defeat and further denting Ihcir 
chances of repealing as champs. 
Norlhern Kentucky leads the confer- 
ence with a 11-2 overall record and 
are 2-0 in the GLVC. Lewis and In- 
dianapolis have also rushed out 10 2- 
starts in the GVLC 

In week 3 action, 1PFW defeated 
St. Francis handily with a sweep. 
The line on that match was 15-12, 
15-13, 15-8. Then the Dons were 
handed four consecutive losses. The 
first defeat came lo the hands of the 
learn from Morningside, who defeat- 
ed the Dons in four games. The final 
line was 15-8, 15-13, 12-15, 15-8. 
The next loss came from Mankalo 
Stale, who swept the Dons in three 
with a 15-6, 15-9, 15-5 whipping. 
The nexl opponent was host St. 
Cloud Stale, who also swept the 
Dons 15-13, 15-6, 15-5. The final 
defeat in the St. Cloud Slate louma- 
ment came from Minnesota-Duluth. 
They also swept the Dons 15-6, 15- 
9, 15-5. It should be noted, even 
though the Dons were 0-4 in this 
tournament, that three of those four 
learns were ranked in ihe "Top 25" 
in the nation. 

Statistically speaking, IPFWs 
Heather Teagarden ranks second in 
the conference in kills. In 46 games 
played, Teagarden has 161 kills 
(lops in conference) giving her a 
3.50 kills per game average. 

In the hilling percentage category, 
Jill Lyon ranks sixth in the confer- 
ence. In 47 games played, Lyon has 
53 kills in 119 attempts with only 14 
errors giving her a percentage of 
.328. 

- In the assist category, Lyon also 
leads the way for IPFW and ranks 
seventy in the conference in this cat- 
egory. In 47 games played, Lyon has 
had 354 assists giving her a 7.53 as- 
sist per game average.

New assistant coach 
is named to post 



Indiana-Purdue Fori Wayne has an- 
nounced Ihe hiring or Lisa Miller as 
Ihe new women's assistant basket- 
ball coach. 

Miller, a native of Fort Wayne, and 
a 1992 graduate of IPFW, will as- 
sume her new role as full-time assis- 
tant after serving as a student assis- 
tant last year. 

; The fact that Lisa Miller is contin- 
uing her basketball career at IPFW is 
certainly no surprise lo the people of 
Fort Wayne Leading the Fori Wayne 
area two years straight at Bishop 
Dwcnger High School, Miller would 
bring the same scoring punch to 
IPFW as a freshman in 1988. 
i By the time Miller's career had 
concluded, her achievements had re- 
ceived national acclaim, and her 
name was written in the record 
books of IPFW and Ihe NCAA Divi- 
sion II. Finishing with a career total 
of 2,358 pt/nts, Miller ended as 
IPFW's all-time leading scorer and 
seventh (7th) in the all-time NCAA 
record books. There was perhaps a 
no more telling season of Miller's 
dominance thai her senior season 
where she averaged 25.9 points per 
game (second in the nation) en-route 
to first team Kodak All-Amcrican 
honors. In addition. Miller w.is.i 
three-time GLVC All-Aoidtmic se- 
lection and received the NCAA 
post-graduate scholarship. 

Miller will assist head coach Eileen 
Kleinfelter wilh a team that shows as 
much promise as any learn in the 
history of IPFW basketball. Finish- 
ing last year at 10-17. the Lady Dons 
return six double figure scorers from 
last year, including 1993 GLVC 
Newcomer of the Year, Lindy Jones. 
Add to that the return of pre-season 
All-American Pam Edwards, who 
sat out last year as a medical red- 
shirt, and the optimism seems to be 
at an all-time high at IPFW.
