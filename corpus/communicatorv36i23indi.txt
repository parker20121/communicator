In fact. Mitch Daniels 
has major plans for all of 
Indiana's myriad roads, over 
seven billion dollars of plans 
for the Indiana road system, 
a program with the catchy 
name of "Major Moves." 
Officially, Major Moves is 



struction bill for the road 
system of Indiana. 

The $8.12 billion proj- 
ect has five major goals: 
to expand the Hoosier 
Heartland Highway, to build 
2 new Ohio River Bridges 
near Louisville, a new high- 
speed corridor between 
Indianapolis and South 
Bend using US 31, to finish 
1-69 between Evansville and 
Indianapolis and to mod- 
ernize the Indiana Toll Road 
Corridor.

Milosevic dies in Hague prison 



Milosvic was slated to begin bis fifth year on trial 



(LATWP Vv 



Slobodan Milosevic, the deposed Yugoslav 
le, ider who lias spent the last lour years on trial 
accused ol genocide and crimes against human- 
ity lor his role in nearlv a decide ot Balkan wars, 
died Satunla\ in his prison cell near The Hague, 
according in [he U.N. international war crimes

in his cell." according to a statement issued 
Saturday in The Hague by the tribunal. Ihe 
statement, which dirt not specify Ihe lime of his 
death, said Dutch police and a Dutch coroner 



there was no evidence of suicide. 

Milosevic's death ends the highest profile 
trial of the war crimes court's investigation of 
Balkan atror nies ot the Wills that left an esti-

as both an instigator &lt;it the violence and the key 
man who could halt it. In 1999, with mount- 
ing reports of Serb atrocities against Kosovo 
Albanians, Clinton convinced NATO partners 
to launch an air war against Serbian forces that 
lasted 78 days. 

Funeral arrangements for Milosevic remained 
in disarm late Saturday night and threatened to 
sharpen I tie divide in Vrbia between Milosevic's

they return to Serbia for a funeral. 

Milosevic had suffered from high blood pres-

and frequently won trial delays to accommo-

He still thinks they should be

Rodriguez also tells of five 
signs that may tell why children 
become involved in gangs. 

The first one is rootlessness. 
The children do not have deep 



personal, social, and political 
power. 

They see that they do not 

and that their parents do not 
have any power over their lives 

The third is hopelessness: 
they feel that there is no way to 

control their own lives. 

That leads to the next one 
which is helplessness: they feel 
like they can not do anything 
at all, and that no one will help 
them either. 

The last one is meaningless; 
here the person feels that their 
life has no meaning.

Women in Science 
Program supports

By Savannah Worley

"Woman scientist" is a 
term the Women in Science 
Program at Indiana University 
works to make a reality rather 
than a contradiction. 

The program works to 
encourage women to pursue 
careers in science, technol- 
ogy and engineering. It has 
been operating and expand- 
ing for more than 12 years. 

Carol McCord, assis- 
tant dean of the Office for 
Women's Affairs, said WISP

themselves in a science-relat- 
ed field eventually end up 
having a family, 

She said there are too many 
time conflicts for women 
between the lab and taking 
care of their children. 

She also said these women 
often encounter biases with 
their colleagues. 

"Some feel that if a woman 
has a child, she is not serious 
about her care"er," McCord 
said. "Science isn't a nurtur- 
ing thing." 

WISP also provides child-

they say, is constitutionally structured in such a way as to prevent

The reasons why tins ha- happened are not complicated. The

In both cases there is a clear cut conflict ol interest; the inter-

interests of a pohiicil party conflict with those of the citizenry. 
However, the latter case is worse; if a Senator's first loyalty isn't to 
the citizenry, or even principle, but to some other organization to 
which he belongs., the entire point of representative democracy 
has been defeated. 

Such a case results in our present situation - elected officials 
who are loyal, not to the electorate, but to the party. We end up 
with men who will sell out civil liberties, endorse a ruinous and

Indiana in need of sex ed 



by Andres Ponte / graphic5@ipfwcommunicator.0rg 



Staff Editorial 

Accoridng to a study by the 
Guttmacher Institute, Indiana 
was recently ranked 49th among 
the, states in preventing unwanted 
pregnancies. 

In the United States, about half 
the unplanned pregnancies were 
by couples using contraceptives 
incorrectly. 

The other half are from no 
contraceptives being used at all. 

Indiana's plan, along with the 
United States government, is to 
provide better sex education and 
access to birth control. 

This sounds like a good plan. 

China has already realized this. 
But, China has taken it a step too 
far. 

Kindergartners in China now 
attend sex education classes. 
fvimltT^artners. , 

How are children, who can barely 
write their own name, understand 
the concept of sex and the use of 



protection. 

Start sex education earlier, that 
makes sense, but kindergarten? 

Sex education should be taught 
in all schools to help curb the 
numbers of unwanted pregnancies 
and to keep the number of sexually 
transmitted diseases down. 

It is the responsible thing to do. 

However, the idea of teaching 
five-year-olds how to properly put 
a condom on using their banana 
from snack time as a visual aid 
that is taking responsibility to the 



According to Guttmacher, Uiere 
were 16.020 teenage pregancies in 
Indiana in 2000. 

Of these, 68% resulted in live 
births and 17% ended in abortion. 

With adequate sexual eduation 
Indiana can stop making headlines 
across the country as being one 
of the worst states in preventing 
unwanted pregnancies.

IPFW tennis coach 



Eric Burns on: 




The women's tennis 
team 

ON WINNING 8 OF 
LAST 11: We are just 
playing pretty well. 
Nothing can really be 
said other than that 
they are showing up 
and playing good 
tennis. We've had 
the makings to be a 
good team. We're just 
putting it together. 



ON THE PLAY OF FRESHMAN SACHI JANEK: 
I definetely expected her to play well. She 
has been put in a tough 
position playing one 
singles. But she has been 
playing well. Her and 
Ashley Coulson...the 
two of them are pretty 
well interchangable. 
But it's good to put her 
in as a freshman to get 
experience. She has 
pretty well earned that 
spot with good matches 
in practice. I just think 
maybe that helps her a little bit on down the 
line and our team on down the line. That 
pushes her to improve her game as much 
as it did Ashley last year. And next year we'll 
come back with a stronger team. 

The men's tennis team 

ON THEIR PLAY SO FAR (6-8): They've played 
pretty well. We've lost I believe four matches 
by a score of 4-3. That is equivalent to a couple 
points in a basketball game. Our inability to 
play solid doubles has killed us. Our singles 
play is well. It comes down to that doubles 
point where you've got to get two of three. 
We get one but not that second one. We need 
to continue to improve on that. It's just an 
ongoing thing. We have more singles than 
doubles players and got to develop doubles a 
little bit more.

Fife continued the change, like it or 
not. And in the end, it was the best thing 
for the program and for IPFW. A year 
ago, I was skeptical of the entire Dane 
Fife experiment. Heck, a year ago his 
only official title at IPFW was "Candidate." 
And 1 will admit, I did not think then what 
I think now in regards to Fife. 

1 say this for one primary reason — 
Fife, and Pope for that matter, made very 
clear statements and promises when the 
hiring was announced last March. And 
they did not lie. 

They instead stood with their word 
and carried it out. That is admirable 10 
say the least. 

Is there still work to do? Of course. 1 
don't think that Dane Fife, his staff or their 
players would say any different. But there 
are so many positives to

The six parts of the concerto were short, each section with its

The next piece was the more sedate Bach Suite No. 4 in D

The final piece was Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 in C Major. 
Hits piece was original^ performed as part of a monster 
concert which Beethoven created to advertise his musical 
abilities. It came at the close of what has been estimated 
to be almost a four-hour performance. As a result of the 
symphony's placement on the program, the original orchestra 
was exhausted and the symphony's first performance was 
lackluster. 

However, the symphony l.iiei became one of Beethoven's 
most popular and, during the early 180DS, it was hts most 
performed symphony.

Then I heard him for myself, 
and now I find myself quoting 
his jokes. Dane Cook jokes and 
quotes stay with you (like it or 
not) and il takes a true genius

As long as, while listening to
