iarize themselves with ail exits in each building.

if possible and as you leave close all doors 
behind you.

not to block exits. 

e. All persons except those specifically designated 
by the Chancellor should leave the building. 

4. Fire Alarm Pull Boxes are located throughout each 
building.

of the fire or emergency. The information will be 
channeled to the proper department.
