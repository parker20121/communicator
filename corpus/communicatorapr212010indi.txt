1PFW has a long 
history of supporting sports - in fact, they 
currently support a wide range of sports. The University's support of 
volleyball, for example, has been unwavering for years, which is one reason 
lPFW's volleyball teams are so dominant. There are, however, other sports 
that students engage in at this campus. Take skateboarding for example.

Not just anyone can run for office 
at IPFW. There are requirements, 
specifically laid out in the IPSGA 
bylaws. They are available on page 6 
of the constitution, http://www.ipfw. 
edu/stugov/constitu tionFinal.doc 

According to the IPSGA election 
code http://iprw.edu/smgov/home. 
docs.htm, the election board is to be 
made up of seven members, selected 
by the current president, and their 
primary responsibility is to run the 
student elections. Kristina Stevenson, 
current board member, stated the 
board's purpose is to "monitor how 
candidates run" and ensure that the 
elections are "fair, clean and honest." 

Part of the process includes 
sanctions for rule violations. "The 
Election Board will allocate between 
one (1) and five (5) Sanction Points 
for each violation, the exact number 
to be determined by the Election 
Board based on the severity and 
frequency of the violations. Upon 
accumulation of eight (8) (or more)

Sanction Points, the candidate will be 
removed from the ballot and all votes 
cast for that candidate will be voided. 
If the Election Board unanimously 
finds that any violation or sequence of 
violations warrants disqualification 
from candidacy, that candidate shall 
be removed from the ballot and all 
votes cast for that candidate will be 
voided regardless of Sanction Points," 
states the election code. 

Even before the campaigning 
began, there were policy issues, 
as shown in a Facebook status 
of the IPSGA Student Election 
Headquarters, posted March 4, 
2010 "Very Important Message 
for Candidates: We would like to 
reiterate that campaigning does 
not begin ANY PLACE ANYWHERE 
until Tuesday, March 16, 2010. This 
includes Facebook! Any posts must 
be deleted immediately. Thank you."

Young people are telling 
us they don't want a party: 

America Needs to Listen o P Ed 




By John Opdycke 

U. tA Michigan Graduate 



The Census Bureau is making a 
concerted effort lo fully include young 
people - witness Commerce Secretary 
Gary Locke's recent appearance on 
The Daily Show. Census takers will 
be knocking on dorm rooms and 
checking to see who is crashing on the 
couch, bu( regardless of how thorough 
Lhey are, they will miss out on one 
dramatic populaU'on migration: young 
Americans are opting not to affiliate 
with a political party. 

Fully 50% of voters aged 18-29 
now identify as independents, and the 
percentage of the electorate under 30 
is growing. In 2006, 18-29 year olds 
accounted I for 21% of the electorate. By 
2015, estimates are that 18-29 year olds 
will account for 33% of all voters. 

But the millennial generation finds 
itself confronted by an electoral system 
designed by— and for — the I Like 
Ike crowd. Party politics dominates. 
Election districts are gerrymandered 
to serve party interests. Many states 
require poll workers to be registered 
Democratic or Republican. The 
Federal Election Commission is 
comprised of three Democrats and 
three Republicans, rendering it both 
structurally Impotent and blind to the 
concerns of independents. And most 



significantly, primary elections are off 
limits to independents in 17 states. 

The official attitude among political 
elites towards the independence 
of younger voters ranges from 
amusement to outright hostility. Gail 
Collins of the New York Times recently 
opined on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" 
that "the only kind of people voting in 
primaries tend to be the lunatic ends of 
the party because everyone else thinks 
its so much suaver and cooler to say 
they are independent." 

Collins' message to new voters — 
delivered with typical sarcasm — is to 
join a party and get with the program. 
Her view is shared by many political 
insiders who see independents as 
"fence sitters" who cannot be bothered 
to get involved. 

But mlllennials' are not apathetic; 
they voted in record numbers in 2008. 
They vote, they volunteer, but they 
don't want to join a party. And their 
stubborn independence has fueled a 
national controversy on the issue of 
open vs. closed primaries. 

Republican hardliners in Rhode 
Island, Idaho, and Arizona are pushing 
to close their state's primaries. The 
Idaho GOP has gone so far as to file suit 
to force the State of Idaho to require 
voters to select a party when they 
register lo vote.

you would like to spend time with them based on 
that, then go for it.

Horoscopes 



For the Week 



ARIES (Mar. 21- April 20) If you are in the midst of 
a financial deal, this is your lucky day. Unreliable people 
will be negative about your ideas. Don't give in too quickly. 
If you put your mind to it, you could entertain or host a 
multitude of social events. 



TAURUS (Apr. 21 -may 21) Youwon'thavemuchtime 
for your mate this week. If you act with anger you may blow 
the relationship. Don't overspend on friends or children. 
This could be a serious relation ship. 



GEMINI (May 22-|une 21) You might find added 
popularity with those around you this week. Advancement 
can be yours if you are assertive in your approach. Get busy 
on projects that improve your own image; you'll have the 
discipline to succeed. 



CANCER (June 22-July 221 Talk to someone you trust 
if you need advice about broaching the subject. Strong 
willpower will come to your rescue. Don't confide in any 
relatives whom you know have a tendency to meddle in 
other people's affairs. You'll regret every word. 



LEO (July 23-Aug 22) Do not get involved in joint 
financial ventures. Problems with appliances or electrical 
gad gets will drive you crazy. You will enjoy physical activities 
more than you think. The only thing you'll accomplish is a 
bad reputation. 



VIRGO (Aug. 23 -Sept. 23) Outdoor sports events 
should entice you. You'll stay out of trouble if you pick 
projects that will benefit the whole family. This might not be 
a day for hasty decisions. Relatives may play an important 
role in your social activities. 



LIBRA (Sept. 24 -Oct. 23) It may be a disappointing 
J day emotionally. Your best gains will come through 
helping others emotionally. Any contributions you make to 
organizations will enhance your reputation and bring you 
offers. Don't settle for less than the best. 



SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22) Try not to take 
everything so seriously. Opportunities for romance will 
develop through group endeavors; however, the association 
isn't likely to last. The locks, stove, gas, or electric wires may 
not be secure. 



SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 -Dec. 21) Don't let your 
partner start any arguments. Passion should be redirected 
positively. You can offer your help to others but back off if 
they appear to be offended by your persistence. Do not get 
involved in joint financial ventures. 

CAPRICORN (Dec 22- |an. 20) Visitors may drop by 
unexpectedly, resulting in tension with your lover. Look into 
ways that you can make extra cash. Your home environment 
appears to be a little shaky. Look into physical activities that 
will help get rid of some of that tension you may be feeling. 



AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 -Feb. 19) Your need to put 
great detail into everything you do may cause you to miss 
the overall picture. Emotionally, things may not run so 
smoothly. Listen to the advice given by others. You might 
not be as reserved on an emotional level as you'd like. 



PISCES (Feb. 20-Mar. 20) Partnerships could be 
tense. Don't push your luck. Trips, educational pursuits, or 
projects that could lead to new oudooks should be on your 
agenda. Catch up on any correspondence you've neglected.

roommates, parents, or other significant people in your 
life, then reading You're a Horrible Person, But I Like 
You, could clear a few things up. The book is a collection 
of advice (often silly and sometimes inappropriate) 
from actors and writers like Sarah Silverman, Rainn 
Wilson and Judd Apatow, among others. 

The advice assortment is decendy varied- Superbad's 
Michael Cera answers a reader's question about whether 
turdes tell jokes. Cera remarks that they most definitely 
do not tell jokes. Some of his answers are perhaps the 
most serious of all the other contributors. 

But if you call Alan from The Hangover you* personal 
hero, then you'll also like reading the actor who plays 
him, Zach Galifianakis'. contribution in the book. When 
he tackles die tough question about what to do about a 
receding hairline, he keeps it simple by suggesting the 
man losing hair wear a ski mask or a fez. Another star 
of The Hangover, comedian Ed Helms, openly discusses 
theorigin of the name unicorn, by calling the questioner, 
Ava from Iowa, "really dumb." 

The book is obviously not to be taken seriously, as 
it contains impractical answers to frankly ridiculous 
questions. But if you have been stressed out lately and 
you want to read or skim through something that can 
cause a few laughs. You're a Horrible Person, But I Like 
You is a winner.

In continuing with the "summer'' 
movies, it's time to turn from the classics 
to a more contemporary story — that 
of a group of friends with a magic pair 
of pants. That's right; it's time for The 
Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. While 
defending books over movies the majority 
of the time, I'll admit that I saw this 
movie before I read the book. Was that a 
downfall? Yes, because the book, while 
a quick read, allows the reader to get 
much further into the story, whereas the 
movie simply scrapes the surface. The 
screenwriters chose to make the movie 
just about the girls, leaving many of the 
details of their family lives rather fuzzy. 
For example, the movie focuses on the 
lives of Bridget, Tibby, Carmen, and 
Lena, four girls whose mothers met in an 
aerobics class for pregnant women. Only 
Tibby has siblings, according to the first 
movie. However, according to the book, 
Lena has a sister named EfHe and Bridget 
has a twin brother. 

As for the love interests in the books 
versus that in the movie, Bridget's love 
interest is the same in both forms of the 



story; Lena's is Kostos, but 
different back story in the 
does in the book; Carmen' 
in the book has a girlfriei 
movie does not; Tibby's love 
book begins with one boy e 
to another, whereas in the 
ends up with one. After ree 
and watching the movie, ii

Overall, The Sisterhood c

story; Lena's is Kostos, but he has a very 
different back story in the movie than he 
does in the book; Carmen's love interest 
in the bouk has a girlfriend, but in the 
movie does not; Tibby's love interest in the 
book begins with one boy and later turns 
to another, whereas in the movie, simply 
ends up with one. After reading the book 
and watching the movie, it's not entirely 
clear as to why the screenwriter changed 
that. 

Overall. The Sisterhood of the Traveling 
Pants is a story about change and finding 
oneself. While Hollywood did manage to 
make two movies out of it, they captured 
the angsl of growing up and growing 
slightly apart from the friends you've 
known all your life. While it seems to be a 
movie geared toward high school students 
and the like, many college students can 
relate to having to watch our friends go to 
big universities and lead amazing, excidng 
lives while we stay here and feel like we're 
merely trudging through college, unable 
to think about anything but getting out 
of Fort Wayne. One reviewer (Christy 
Lemire of the Associated Press) said The 
Sisteriiood of the Traveling Pants was "a 
rare movie that women of any age will 
appreciate." Sorry, boys, but that's fairly

Against Me! V- 



Artist: The Menzingers 
Album: Chamberlain 

Label: -Red Scare 

Release Date: April 13, 
2010 

Sounds Like:Triumphant 
pop-punk, lively and just in 
time for Spring. 

Rating: 3.5/5 

The Menzingers second 
full-length album draws 
everything great about 
their first album, A Lesson 
in the Abuse of Information 
Technology, and turns the 
volume up several levels. 

From the first track, 
the anthem-based feel is 
overwhelming and the 
dance inducing percussion 
rings throughout every 
song. The vocals are smooth 
and raspy, weaving between 



clear and disheveled. 

Their influences are 
quite obvious as well, 
several aspects of the album 
sounding like something 
straight off a Clash album. 
Their affinity for the Clash is 
also traced back from their 
first release which holds a 
cover of the Clash's "Straight 
to Hell." 

Though some may feel 
the album, and band in 
general, is a little generic, 
they don't hold back on the 
fun, good natured aspect 
of punk rock. It's evident, 
especially on this album, 
that the band is about 
nothing more than having 
fun with their music and 
putting as much energy as 
possible into the ears of 
their listeners. 




Artist: Against Me!

Anarchist EP 

Label: Sire

has hit their stride with per- 
fection. 

Rating: 5/5 

As most fans already know. 
Against Mel's upcoming re- 
lease Wliite Crosses has leaked 
and the album is no longer 
withheld. With that said, 
Against Me! released this EP 
of four songs, two of which are 
on Wliite Crosses and two that 
are not. I've listened to the 
leadofthenewalbumandit is 
nothing short of perfect. The 
songs on the EP follow suit. 

"I Was A Teenage Anar- 
chist" and "Rapid Decom- 



pression" are the two songs 
included on the album and 
they combine influences from 
all over the place, ranging 
from Bruce Springsteen, The 
Replacements, and the bralty, 
good natured punk rack of 
old. The additional tracks en- 
titled "One by One" and "Bit- 
ter Divisions" still emanate 
perfection. 

Though fans of Against 
Mel's older material will be 
quick to trash this ER their 
sound is refined and the lyr- 
ics never fall short. Vocalist 
Tom Gabel has not lost touch 
with his songwriting, and fans 
that cannot see that need to 
reassess their music taste. As 
a sampling of White Crosses, 
this EP should be first on the 
list to listen to get a taste of 
where the band is going with 
their music.

Local Movie "Beating Traffic" Stars IPFW Student 



By Kelly McLendon 

miJfndon kellyOgiMil &lt;om 



A new film, featuring IPFW studeni 
Crystal Cully, premiered on Saturday, 
April 10, al The Marsh Foundation in 
Van Wert, Ohio. Called "Beating Traffic," 
the film is a "rural romance," showing 
what happens when two people grow 
apart and how choices that are made 
have a larger Impact than many people 
may imagine. 

It tells the story of Jay and Crystal, 
"two high school sweethearts who grew 
apart as Crystal left to pursue acting 
and Jay, a talented singer/songwriter, 
stayed behind to help his struggling 
family." Then, just as lay is getting over 
losing her, Crystal reappears in his life 
and "they must decide to take a chance 
on each other or let fate decide the 
path of their relationship," according 
to the movie press release. 

The film was shot in Ohio. The Com- 
municator interviewed the producer, 
writer and director of the movie, Len 
Archibald, to find out more. Archibald 
is an award-winning playwright and 
also writes a weekly column for 4 1 1 ma- 
nia. com. 

Communicator. How did you get the 
idea for the storyline? 

Archibald: I was initially inspired by 
a 1953 film by Japanese filmmaker Ya- 
sujir Ozu called "Tokyo Story." I wanted 



to create a film that evoked the same 
style but bring it to a Western setting. 
1 had an idea about modem relation- 
ships and drew from my own past ex- 
periences along with the experiences 
of others in my life. 

Communicator Tiiere is a line in 
the movie trailer that says, "They chose 
to drift apart. Now they must choose to 
be together." Do you think that is a com- 
mon theme with most relationships? 

Archibald: I think how our gen- 
eration treats relationships is different 
compared to that of my parents and 
theirs. From my perspective, it seemed 
like there was more of a courtship, trust 
and open-endedncss to how men and 
women treated each other. Now it feels 
like cynicism has taken over this gen- 
eration and we are more willing to walk 
out of a relationship without any true 
closure. 1 think that lack of connection 
is the driving force behind "Beating 
Traffic." 

Even though the two main charac- 
ters grew up together and are "high- 
school sweethearts," they are still cyni- 
cal. Jay had all but given up on his own 
life because Crystal left him behind; he 
sees the world move at a snail's pace 
and so moves with it. Crystal on the 
other hand is impatient and wants ev- 
erything and all answers now - wrapped 
up in a nice organized package. The 
two couldn't be more different, but that 
contradiction is what attracts them to 



each other. 

Communicator Wliat made you 
cast Crystal Cully in the film? 

Archibald: In all honesty, she's my 
muse. I wrote the script specifically 
with her in mind and felt the story 
would not work with anyone else cast 
in her role, hence why 1 didn't even give 



her character a different name. Crystal 
is able to bring a rawness to the screen 
that not many actors her age around 
here can bring. She asks 3 lot of ques- 
tions and is able to understand the 
vaguest of direction I can give her. She's 
a fantastic person to work with cre- 
atively.

Advantages to Gmail 
interface for students 



Economics classes restricted 






ByAlexAxthelrn 

luplnedu 



Earlier this year, ITS converted 
IPFW students' accounts to Google 
Apps, which allowed students to use 
the Gmall interface for their student 
email accounts. The interface for 
Google apps is similar to the Gmail. 
which means most of the features 
from Gmail are available for IPFW 
email accounts. 

The first tool that IPFW email 
users may want to use is to simply 
forward their IPFW account to an- 
other email, to reduce the number 
of inboxes that need to be checked 
each day. To forward the account in 
its entirety, Click on "Settings," in 
die upper right hand comer of the 
window, and then on "Forwardi 




and POP/IMAP" in the yellow box. 
Select "Forward a copy of incoming 
mail to," and then enter the address 
you want all of you IPFW email to be 
forwarded to. 

One of the most useful features 
of this interface is a powerful filter- 
ing system. Emails can be filtered 
based on sender, receiver, the sub- 
ject line, content of the message 
or the existence of an attachment. 
Once the message has been filtered 
based on thecriteria, it canbelabeled, 
archived, automatically marked as 
read or selectively forwarded. This is 
useful if you want to only have cer- 
tain important messages forward- 
ed to your regular email account. 
There are many useful filters to use. 
For example, to put all the emails for 
a specific class together, you could 
sort by sender, and include your pro- 
fessor, some classmates that you're 
working on a project with, and have 
any email that meets those criteria 
iatretEd wufrnbe class name, and 
starred, so"tfra't it is more noticeable 
in the Inbox. 

Another useful filter is to have 
all messages from the IPFW do- 
main never marked as Spam. 

There are other advantages to the 
Gmail interface for fPFW's students, 
such as an IM/Chat feature in the 
window, keyboard shortcuts, and a 
vacation auto-reply feature.

In this day and age, when econom- 
ics is on the top of discussion, many 
students decide to take an economics 
class to learn more about the situation 
and how everything works. However, 
because of the sudden rise in interest, a 
couple of economics classes have been 
restricted to majors, though it is only 
temporary. Intro to Micro Economics 
and Intro to Macro Economics have 
been restricted to make sure that Busi- 
ness and Economics majors are the 
first registered. 

Last Fall there was an increase in 
enrollment of 14.2 percent, said David 
Dilts, Chair of the Economics Depart- 
ment. Because of that increase, eco- 
nomics professors were stretched to 
their limit, with one instructor, for ex- 
ample, teaching over ninety students. 
If there were to be another increase 
this year, "it would be impossible," said 
Dilts. 



In addition, E20T usually has nine 
classes held in the Fall, and E202 usual- 
ly holds three, according to Dilts. Com- 
ing this Fall, IPFW will offer six classes 
for E201 - three of which are off-cam- 
pus - and two for E202, with only one 
on-campus. 

Therefore, students majoring in 
Business and Economics are able to 
register first. Supposing that the classes 
are not full, on April 26, registration for 
Summer classes will be open to non- 
majors, said Dilts. In turn, Fall classes 
will be open for registration of non- 
majors luly 1 1 , said Susan Byers, Direc- 
tor of Student Center. 

According to Byers, the Psychology 
department has also put major restric- 
tions on some of their classes for some 
time. 

Further, major restrictions are a 
common occurrence in many colleges, 
said Dilts. While Dilts said that he was 
sorry for those who have been upset 
by the restriction, he stressed that he 
needed to make sure that majors could 
take the classes that they need.

The NBA playoffs started up 
on Saturday April 17, 2010. With 
the Chicago Bulls winning their 
final game on Wednesday over 
the Bobcats, they wrapped up the 
eight seed, knocking out the Bap- 
tors. But with winning the eight 
seed comes with playing the Cav- 
aliers, who has the best record in 
the NBA. On Saturday the Cava- 
liers dominated the Bulls winning 
96-83. After that game the Hawks 
took on the Bucks, and held them 
in check for the most part. Bucks 
point guard Brandon Jennings 
scored 34 in his playoff debut but 
his team lost 102-92. D-Wade and 
the Heat came up short in Boston 
losing to the Celtics 85-76. In that 
game there was an altercation be- 
tween Kevin Gamett and Quinton 
Richardson, as Garnett elbowed 
Richardson in the head. Garnett 
has been suspended for game 
two. In the last game on Saturday 
Carmelo Anthony scored 42 lead-
