Chancellor Wartell under fire 



Campus atmosphere 'poisoned' 



By Nol Beck le* 
Editor 

One month after stepping down 
as NCAA compliance coordinator, 
David Faircbild has stepped forward 
with charges ibai Cbancelloi 
Michael Wanell is trying to harm his 
reputation 

Fairchild said he started bearing 
rumors about himself two days after 
he stepped down on Sept. 22 

Faircbild, professor and chair of 
philosophy, said the chancellor per- 
sonally approached members of the 
faculty senate and claimed Faircbild 
is emotionally unstable. 

Fairchild said the chancellor 
said his instability was because bis 
wife and daughter do not live with 

Fairchild's wile is a graduate 
student at Richmond University in 
southern Indiana and his daughter is 
a student at Purdue who lives in the 
dorms, Faircbild said. 

"This is a sleazy, underhanded 
way to gel back at me," he said. 

The chancellor does have a file 
concerning Fairchild, said William 



David 
Fairchild 



Frederick, pre- 
siding officer of 
the faculty senate 
and associate 
professor of 
computer sci- 
ence. 

Frederick 
said be was 
called into the 
chancellor's 
office a few days 
after Fairchild 
resigned as 
NCAA compli- 
ance coordinator. 

•• H e 

began a character assassination of 
Dr Fairchild." Frederick said 

According to Frederick, the 
chancellor has a file with several let- 
ters that Wartell solicited from peo- 
ple in athletics. 

These letters were not sponta- 
neously sent to Wanell. Frederick 
said, they were solicited by him only 
after charges against the university 
were made public about the NCAA 
violations. 

The chancellor said there was no 



personnel file on Fairchild other 
than the one that the personnel office 
bas. 

That file, Wanell said, contains 
records of information about which 
health plan the faculty member is a 
part of 

Frederick said he will not meet 
with the chancellor again by himself. 
He said he will definitely have 
someone witb him next time he 
meets with him. 

"1 do nol trust him, I do not 
believe him." Frederick said. 

Coming to fPFW daily has been 
difficult recently 

He said the climate was different 
since Wartell became chancellor 
three years ago. 

"It's a negative place to be," 
Fairchild said. 

Fredrerick said the chancellor 
will not lake any responsibility for 
anything of substance and will never 
go on record on anything but 
"innocuous" issues. 

'The moral and ethical climate 
is at ebb tide." Fredenck said. 

Frederick said he has trouble 
coming to the university on a daily 




Michael 
Wartell 



basis. 

He said 
he does not 
want to be here 
Micbael 
Downs, chair 
and professor of 
political sci- 
ence, also said 
being at IPFW 
has been diffi- 
cult lately. 

"Because the 
atmosphere is 
so poisoned and 
so polarized the 
reasonable cen- 
ter is not able to influence the poli- 
cies thai arc being made," Downs 
said. 

Downs said he was nol sure why 
the ambiance of the university is 
uncomfortable but there are accusa- 
tions against the chancellor that may 
have contributed to the feeling. 

"The chancellor is accused of 
ignoring due process in regards to 
grievances, search and screen com- 
mittees and the treatment of univer- 
sity employees," Downs said. 



Lets Talk about often overlooked fathers 



By Abigail Horrom 
Staff Reporter 



The Center for Women and Returning Adults 
is presenting another discussion from the "Let's 
Talk" series. This month the discussion is called 
"The Importance of Fathers." It focuses on father- 
hood wiib an all male panel 

"Very often, fathers are overlooked." said 
Christine Ziclinski, coordinator for the Center for 
Women and Reluming Adults "They may pay ihe 
bills or Ihey're there 10 toss ihe ball but some- 
times we don't take a good look at what their 
value is beyond lhaL" 

The objective is lo look at the role of the 
fathers at different stages in life. One stage deals 
with fathers who are still playing a major part in 
the development of the child. That particular 
aspect may differ tremendously because it takes 
mto consideration whether the father is physical- 
ly present or absent in the home Another stage 
considers fathers after their children have grown 
and the important role they maintain in their chil- 
dren's lives. 

The "Let's Talk" series consists of a monthly 
round table discussion concerning various topics. 

"We've selected topics each month ihat 
involve the roles we play." said Zielinski. "The 
purpose is to basically feed the mind Our discus- 



sions in the past have been really open-ended and, 
as a result, tend to go in a lot of different direc- 
tions that we don't anticipate That is good 
because it stimulates everybody and helps them 
contnbutc what their own particular thoughts 
are." 

The setup of the discussion includes a guest 
panel and anyone who wishes to lake pan in or 
listen to the opinions concerning the topic. 

The guest panel is made up of people who 
have a connection to the particular topic being 
discussed. 

"I primarily try to look for at least one person 
from the community," said Zielinski. "Then there 
are people from the university, but from different 
facets of the university." 

The goal is to have both faculty and students 
combined in the panel By doing (bis, it will 
ensure a blend. Each of them will bring a differ- 
ent look, a different perspective. 

For this month's discussion, Zielinski chose 
Thomas Fowler-Finn, Superintendent of Fort 
Wayne Community Schools, as one of the guests 
on the panel. 

She wanted to find someone in the communi- 
ty who would be interested in talking about this 
subject Zielinski knew that the Superintendent 
nol only had a commitment to education, but also 
to his family. 

The discussions are very casual They begin 



with questions addressed by the panel but then 
continue with contributions from the audience. 

The "Let's Talk" series is new this fall. The 
first one was last month on "The Faces of 
Sisterhood." The next one in November will be 
on "Risk Taking " 

"We all face nsks at different levels and nsk 
taking is something we musi face in order to real- 
ly grow," said Zielinski. "So, next month we wdl 
be having someone who bas taken tbe risk of 
going into business for themselves as well as 
someone who has changed careers We'll look at 
risks from a lot of different bases, not just one." 

Similar programs have been done on campus 
before. Lasl year, during Women's History 
Month, there was a discussion dealing with moth- 
ers and daughters. 

It went over so well that Zielinski and (be 
Center decided to offer other discussions through- 
out the entire year, as well as expand on the dif- 
ferent topics 

The original idea was to make it a woman's 
discussion group. However, men were coming to 
Zielinski exhibiting an interest to participate also 

"We'll find out with the next two and see 
whether or not that will really be true," said 
Zielinski 

These round table discussions are held on the 
last Thursday of each month at noon in the Walb 
Student Union.

Academics 

Zoo offers scholarship 

Applications are now being accepted for the Lawrence A. 
Ackerman scholarship The Fort Wayne Zoological Society is offer- 
ing a $2,000 scholarship for a deserving student pursuing an animal- 
related career. Tbe scholarship is awarded to the appbeant who is 
committed to the care of animals, tbe character of the appbeant, 
financial need and academic achievemenL 

The Fon Wayne Zoological Society started the Lawrence A. 
Ackerman Scholarship in 1992 to honor the distinguished career of 
the late Dr. Ackerman, a former zoo veterinarian. 

Students interested in applying for the scholarship can receive 
an application by calling the zoo at (21 9 (-427-6800. The application 
deadline is Feb. 1. 1998. 



None of the accusations nave 
been proven as of Oct. 28. Several 
charges are pending 

"Frederick's integrity is excel- 
lent," Downs said. 

One case of harassment has been 
given approval for consideration by 
an independent reviewer at Purdue- 
Calumet. 

A former employee in the vice- 
chancellor of academic affairs office 
has filed a grievance against tbe uni- 
versity claiming that a hostile work 
environment was created 

"The chancellor is a person who 
is vindictive and who is petty." 
Fairchild said. 

Fairchild said that the chancellor 
claimed lo have a personal file on 
him. 

According to Fairchild. tbe 
chancellor asked several faculty 
leaders if they were interested in 
seeing the file. 

Downs said that although he bas 
beard the rumors himself, Ihe chan- 
cellor never approached him to 
speak about Fairchild 

He also said be has never been 
offered lo see tbe file on Fairchild. 



Faircbild said he thinks the 
chancellor has files on what he con- 
siders unfavorable faculty that the 
cbancelloi wants to get rid of. 

"There is no good that can come 
out of this," he said. 

Fairchild noted that he has said 
nothing about the NCAA or basket- 
ball since be departed his position as 
compliance coordinator. 

The chancellor makes decisions 
"colored through the glasses of 
'How can I get back at somebody,'" 
be said 

Fairchild also said what is hap- 
pening to bim also happened lo 
anotber faculty member a few years 
ago. 

According to Fairchdd, a chair 
of a department in Arts and Sciences 
disagreed with the chancellor 

That chair incurred Wartell's 
disfavor and the chancellor began to 
say the person was unstable and hav- 
ing an unstable borne life. 

The department bad a little bit of 
their budget cut in certain places 
with the understanding that when the 
chair was replaced, the cuts would 
be reinstated. 



Campus thefts on rise 



Bv Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 

The scariest thing about going 
lo class should nol be ihe thought of 
what is going (o happen to you on 
the way there. Fortunately, IPFW is 
doing fairly well as far as crime is 
concerned. 

But that is one area that the cam- 
pus cannot afford to ignore. 

According to Officer Larry 
Jinks, the campus is "extremely 
safe." Jinks has been at the IPFW 
campus for 10 years 

So. how safe is IPFW? 
According to the Police and Safety 
Quarterly Report the statistics seem 
to illustrate that the campus, as a 
whole, has a lot to do in order to 
make the campus a safe haven of 
sorts. Here are some facts: In the 
July/September 1996 quarter, there 
was only one case of personal theft. 
During tbe July/ September 1997 
quarter, there have been 15 cases. 

Most of these thefts occur to 
vehicles Officer Jinks believes this 
phenomenon may be attributed to a 
false sense of security that some 
people develop as a result of using 
the parking garage. 

"It is much easier for someone 
to break into a car without being 
seen in a parking garage.", said 
Jinks. "Oul in the open, there is a 
greater chance that someone will 
dnve by and sec them." 

Officer Tom Haner thinks that 
individuals (faculty, students and 
staff) could all be more careful when 
it comes to preventing the two most 



prevalent problems on campus as far 
as personal safety is concerned 

"If you've noticed, we have two 
problem areas, personal theft and 
car accidents." said Haner "Faculty, 
students, and staff need to take care 
of their personal belongings 
they're a little naive leaving things 
laying around, like in the library, 
they leave things whde they go look 
for another book." 

Even with the problem areas. 
Haner feels that IPFW is a very safe 
campus He cites a survey thai sup- 
ports his position. 

"About one and a half or two 
years ago, a survey was taken and 
IPFW ranked really well." said 
Haner. "There's always improve- 
ments to be made " 

Everyone on campus can take 
an active role in keeping it safe. 

Tbe following are tips that 
everyone can incorporate into their 
routines to help keep themselves 
safe: report all suspicious activity 
immediately, don't leave your valu- 
ables unattended and make sure all 
office doors are locked. 

In keeping with its mission to 
"protect and serve the campus com- 
munity by providing a safe environ- 
ment through enforcement, service, 
and education," campus police pro- 
vide the following services: 
• jump starts for stranded motorists

Lack of leadership 
on campus, go figure 



The house of cards has top- 
pled. The cai is out of the 
bag The bam door has been 
left open and the livestock have fled. 

Whatever cliche you want to use 
here would apply because for the 
first time since Chancellor Michael 
Wartell entered IPFW the faculty 
have stood as a group against him 
and his "underhanded, sleazy" prac- 
tices. 

For several years, we at The 
Communicator have known about 
how the chancellor does business. 
He has tried to remove at least one 
editor and possibly several more. 

For years we have seen several 
professors and administrators leave 
the university 



Maybe if the 



under 

circuin- 

stances 

Recently 
we have 
become aware 
of a member 
of the admin- 
istration who 
had the cam- 
pus police 
sent to ber 
borne to 
retrieve ber 
office key 
The person in 
question 
stands barely 
five -foot tall 
and maybe 
weighs 100 
pounds soak- 
ing wet. 

Hopefully 
the Gestapo 
were not 
under orders 
to strip search 
her or do a 
body cavity 
search. 

On Oct. 
13, several 
members of 
the faculty 
senate ques- 
tioned (be 
leadership at 
this universi- 

IPFW ■" 
procedures are being ignored by the 
administration One member of the 
senate said ibe administration's lack 
of leadership reduces the faculty's 
trust in them 

Strangely, during the debate 
about whether the university admin- 
istration wdl support the faculty. 
Chancellor Wanell said, "Nothing 
this far away is carved in stone, but 
it looks as if General Colin Powell 
will be on campus for a fundraising 
opportunity for the alhleuc program 
on April 9, 1998." 

We do not understand why the 
chancellor is reluctant to assume a 
leadership position on this campus 



Being the chancellor, Wartell should 
exercise his power in a positive way 
rather than spend his time trying to 
exact revenge on bis enemies. 

Whether there is an enemies list 
or not is immaterial. Whether there 
are secret files or not is immaterial. 
The most important thing here is a 
lack of strong leadership from (be 
chancellor. He needs to stop collect- 
ing leiiers and soliciting leders 
againsi his "enemies." None of these 
actions are conducive lo a learning 
environment. Even our professors 
acknowledge that fact. Several pro- 
fessors nave said that coming to 
IPFW is no longer fun for them. 

Why is that? Maybe if the chan- 
ellor spent a lit- 



tie less time 
removing 
department 
chairs and cut- 
ting budgets 
from his enemies 
there would be 
time for I cade r-

LITTLE LESS TIME 



REMOVING 



DEPARTMENT CHAIRS 



AND CUTTING 



BUDGETS FROM HIS

LEADERSHIP. 




This is a 
trickle-down sit- 
uation. If there is 
a tumor at the 
top it will 
inevitably travel 
downward and 
infect the facul- 
ty. One of them, 
in our front page 
story, said the 
IPFW's atmos- 
phere is "poi- 
soned" and 
"polarized." 

Can the 
chancellor 
change this? Of 
course, he's the 
chancellor 



Transitional studies fails for student 



H 

long will the 
infection of the 
faculty lake to 
invade students? 

If this climate 

^^^^^^^ continues there 
is no doubt (bat we. the students, 
will be infected. The only question 
is when. 

Can the chancellor change this? 
Of course, he's the chancellor 

The chancellor may deny that he 
has a personnel file on David 
Fauxhdd despite other people who 
said they have seen it. 

We doubt the chancellor has a 
file any longer on Fairchild because 
if be were as shrewd as he appears to 
be that file would have been 
destroyed long ago 

But then again if be were so 
clever why are his former allies turn- 
ing againsi him? 



To the editor: 

You may have heard of 
Transitional Studies, located in 
Kettlcr Hall on the second floor 

Well, when I first heard of it, I 
(bought it was going to be a great 
help to me and my calculus class 

Right now 1 am struggling to gel 
a C in that class, and ibis is with no 
help from transitional studies. 

Transitional Studies supposedly 
offers each student on this campus 
two free hours of tutoring in any 
subject 

All you need to do is go and sign 
up in a book of tutors. 

There are some guidelines 
though you may need to know. 



Once you sign up, you musl call 
AT LEAST 2 hours ahead of time if 
you cannot make your appointment 
(NO PROBLEM!) 

If you do not call twice in the 
same semester, you lose the privi- 
lege of this "wonderful" tutorial 
invention. 

What if the tutor doesn't call in, 
you ask? 

Oh, that is a different story. If 
they don't call in, it's okay. 

They can make excuses at (he 
last minute and you arc stuck for an 
hour by yourself, when (bougbl you 
were going to gel help 

I know this from experience. I 
am a freshman here a( IPFW and I 
have gone through three tutors in 
Calculus in this one semester. 



How much help have I 
received? None I get more help 
from those in my class than those 
who are getting paid to do this!!! 

My first tutor didn't show up 
twice, my second said they couldn't 
help me and my third called my 
bouse 15 minutes before the session 
was supposed lo start (at the time I 
was in Calculus class — not at 
home). 

Sounds like a pretty organized 
and disciplined program we have for 
tutoring. 

My advice to all students is to 
not waste your time trying to think 
you arc going to get help, because 1 
have tried for almost nine weeks to 
do that, repeatedly telling myself 
that it will help in the long run 



But you know what, it's not. So 
why even waste my time!!! I'll just 
get help from my friends — forget 
Transitional Studies. 

And as for Trasiiional Studies, I 
think it's maybe time to gel your act 
together. 

I really care about the students 
on campus. You need to find tutors 
that are qualified to get the job done. 

I know for a fact thai I am not 
the only one that has not liked this 
experience, so either SHAPE UP or 
SHIP OUT!!!

pus as where 
I'm parking 
now." 

As I 
was thinking 
this, two stu- 
dents walked 
by and they 
were question- 
ing the location 
of the new 
parking garage 
and whether or not they will actual- 
ly park there. 

It did not sound like they were 
planning on using the new facility 
This was mainly because of 
safety concerns They did not want 
to walk that far in the dark and 
wouldn't feel safe once inside the 
garage. 

Now, I will be ihe first one to 
say that the location of the garage 
was not planned in the interest of 
the students. 

When winter comes, the Tight 
for close parking spots will 
increase and many won't volunteer 
to bike from (he new garage to 
KetUer. 

But never fear, I have my own 
theory on how this new parking 
garage could benefit the students. 
although the faculty will not be 
happy. 

The new parking garage will be 
known as "The Faculty Garage." 

There will be no "A" or "B" 
parking, there will be "Sludenl" 
and "Facully" parking. 

Faculty and staff can have full 
use of thai new garage. This will 
free up all those close parking spots 
thai are now deemed "A," for the 
students. 

Imagine, we the students, being 
able to park in the front row of any 
parking lot! 

In the winter it would be a short 
mad dash into the building, not a 
five mile hike. 



Now. bow wdl we tell the fac- 
ulty cars from those of the stu- 
dents? Simple. When we pay our 
tuition we gel "student" permits 
with the cost included witb tuition 
and the faculty will receive their 
permits 
from cam- 
pus police. — S ^^^^^^^^™ 

What 
about pnee 
you ask? 
Not a prob- 
lem either. 
There will 
be one 
straight fee 
for boib 
students 
and faculty 
As of this 
semester, 
students 
pay $2 per 
credit hour. 
So, if you 
have 12 hrs. 
this semes- 
ter, you are 
paying $24 
to park this 
year 
Faculty, if 
they choose 
lo, pay $78 
for full- 
lime and 
$32 for 
pan-time. 

B u i 
remember, ^SKSE^^^^S 
that is only 
if ihey want 

to park in "A." otherwise (hey pay 
nothing and park for free. 

Unlike the students, who pay lo 
park regardless of whether or not 
they even drive lo campus. 

I can already hear the adminis- 
tration shooting down my idea due 
to financial reasons, but I have that

and I'm sure I'm not alone. 

I'm not suggest- 
ing thai an 
^^^^^^^" increase of $30 is 
okay. I'm talking 
like $10 more per 
student 

Also, I 
believe that the 
campus police 
will still write 
tickets and collect 
money from the 
parking meters. 
Plus, there would 
be the new rev- 
enue from all the 
faculty and staff 
that are parking 
for free now I am 
no mathematician 
but I'm sure that 
the school would- 
n't lose money. 

1 know 
that the facully 
and administra- 
tion will not see 
the brilliance of 
my idea and that's 
fine. They don't 
want to hike to 
campus either 
(but nobody 
asked us where to 
^^^^SS put the new 
garage) and for 
many years they 
have had the luxury of M A" park- 
ing. 

It's time for the students to 
come oul on top when it comes to 
parking at this institution because 
without the students, there would 
be no facully, no administration 
and no parking... period.

Bombs threaten education 

Expel terrorists to Ireland 



To the editor: 

I would iik- to say something of 
the receni events happening this 
semester's mid-term 

I have noticed a lot of activity 
from a certain select group of stu- 
dents whose job it is to make every- 
one on campus stall in their educa- 
tion and push behind schedules of 
faculty and employees alike. 

The students in Terrorism 10! 
should NOT. I repeat NOT be 
allowed to conduct out-of-class pro- 
jects at the expense of the college 
community. 

They make learning incredibly 
difficult and short-change the effort 
put forth by teachers here to educate 
us to a better life. 

Instead we should be looking 
for alternative ways these students 
of mayhem can keep up their in- 
class projects without disturbing 
others who are struggling through 
their learning careers. 

Instead of calling in bomb 
threats to Kettler Hall, I think that a 
good way of conducting Terrorism 
101 during mid-terms would be to 
fly these elite students to Northern 
Ireland have them spend a week at 
some IRA day camp and explosive 
seminars. 

Perhaps they will also get to 
actually be involved in a firefighl or 
even gel to have moloiov cocktails 
hurled upon diem. Wouldn't that be 
more realistic? 

Certain students of Elementary 
Education have what is called 
"shadowing" to help them belter 
grasp the finer points of iheir cho- 
sen careers. 

We could set up a "shadowing" 
of sorts for these terrorism students 
as well. I hear that the Middle East 
is lovely this time of year 

Whatever the method chosen, 

.• ■ 



as long as they are AWAY from this 
campus and not allowed to practice 
their disruptive techniques upon us, 
I think all involved will live to be a 
happier more gentle and peace-lov- 
ing student body. 

Except for those in Terrorism 
101, but isn't that what they are 
going to school for? 
Sincerely, 



Bob Snyder 
IPFW Student 



Bomb this! 

To the Editor: 

I'm writing this letter to the per- 
son or persons responsible for the 
bomb threats. I ihink it is ridiculous 
what is going on here. I pay very 
good money to-attend IPFW and not 
only are you wasting my money, but 
also my time. My lime is very valu- 
able and I think it is very inconsid- 
erate and selfish of the people who 
are responsible. If you don't want to 
take a test or go to class, make up 
your own excuse not to go or drop 
the class. It is not fair to afieci the 
whole student body because you are 
not prepared for class.

By G«il "Hell and Damnation" 
Ruble Crawford 
Featufiei Eottor 

I love Halloween and had 
planned to ihnll all of my loyal 
readers with an account of my har- 
rowing personal experience in a 
local haunted venue Many people 
have heard of local haunted places, 
but no one could actually tell me 
where one was located. 

After many trials and tribula- 
tions, I still couldn't find the loca- 
tion of any supposedly baunied 
place. It's not as if anyone had vol- 
unteered to come with me to one. 
anyway (maybe the people thai I 
work wilb here at "The 
Cornmunicaior" are scaredy-cats) 
Whatever. 

I had to eventually give up my 
personal ghost-tracking crusade (for 
lack of facts and much help from 
anyone) and put my story idea 
aside 

Since I refuse lo pnnt even one 
tired old line about the origins of 
Halloween, I was left with squat to 
write about for this holiday. Then it 
hit me: why not pass on some popu- 
lar urban legends lo my loyal read- 
ers? Urban legends are stories that 
"supposedly" happened. 

The same stories tend to float 
through every community in one 



form or another So here I've cho- you right now that if ihis should 

sen some very popular urban leg- happen to me, I will not live to tell 

ends, and you, the reader can decide about it I will drop dead on the spot 

if you think thai they're true or not. of a bean attack. 



The Haunted Bridge 

Legend has it lhat one warm, 
summery night, a husband and wife 
were driving down a deserted 
stretch of highway when iheir car 
bad a flat tire. They pulled iheir car 
off lo the side of a bridge on the 
road to fix the flat 

The husband cvcr-so-gallantly 
got the spare lire and jack oul of the 
trunk and began to change the tire 
The wife began to gel restless and 
decided to get out of the car and 
walk around. 

Enjoying the warm night air. 
she walked toward the other side of 
the bridge to look over at the moon- 
light shining on the river below 
Seemingly out of nowhere, a semi- 
truck came roaring down (he quiet 
highway, struck (he woman dead 
and disappeared on iis way, never 
slopping. 

If you drive down that deserted 
stretch of highway on a warm sum- 
mer night, legend has it that the 
ghosl of the dead wife jumps on the 
hood of your car and stares at you 
through the windshield to see if you 
are her murderer. 

I can solemnly swear to each of 



The Face In the Wall 

There's supposed to be a house 
in Terre Haute wilh a huge slone 
wall surrounding it. In this wall, 
there is an imprint of a face. 

That's righu I said an imprint of 
a face 

The impnnt is allegedly the face 
of the owner's son. When the boy 
was sixteen years old, his father 
bought him a brand-spanking-new 
car. The boy went out and got drunk 
immediately to celebrate 

When he tried to make the turn 
into his driveway that night, he was 
driving very fas' and missed the 
turn. 

His car rammed into the stone 
wall and he was thrown forward 
through the car windshield because 
he wasn't wearing a seatbelt. 

He hit the wall so hard that his 
face left an impnnt that still remains 
today. 

Okay, this little legend has a 
moral, girls and boys — well, actual- 
ly, it has two: Don't drink and drive 
(duh) and wear a seatbelt (bigger 
dub) 

This legend is like a highly 
graphic public service message. On 



the freaky-o-meter, I don't buy it at 
all. Ob, and check this out: if you 
touch the face, you'll die very soon. 
Ooohhhhh, I'm scared. 

The Stump — Stepp Cemetery 
I've beard several versions of 
this little ditty, but here's die best 
one: Stepp Cemetery is located off 
a liny path in Morgan-Monroe State 
Forest, around Martinsville. 
Indiana. 

There are only about 25 head- 
stones lhat remain there. The names 
have faded off of the grave markers, 
but there is one thai is clearly a 
child's gravesite. 

Near (he child's grave is an old 
tree stump in the shape of a chair. 
Every night, the ghosi of the baby's 
mother sits and watches — and 
waits. She has long while hair and 
always dresses in black. She never 
bugs visitors, she jusi sits on the 
stump rocking her imaginary baby 
in her arms 

The supposed truth to this 
story is thai a local woman bad a 
child who was stuck by a car. Sbe 
buried her baby in Stepp Cemetery 
and had the stump fashioned into a 
chair so thai sbe could sit in the 
cemetery and protect ber baby from 
strangers If anyone sits in the chair 
or even touches it when she's not 
present, sbe has cursed it and that

Ghostly Battle 
Twelve miles north of 
Williamsport, there is a two-story 
bouse that is the stomping ground 
for some very, very famous spec- 
tres. It seems thai General William 
Henry Harrison doesn't know thai

This house lies on the exact 
spot where General Harrison and his 
troops marched lo battle . 
Supposedly, in early November you 
can hear the marching of hundreds 
of soldiers coming from the south 



You can hear drums rolling and

There are no actual apparitions,

Staff Reporter 

Halloween... .it's a night of trick 
or treating and getting dressed up in 
the most unique costumes Yet. 
what would this morbid holiday be 
without a Utile scary stuff mixed in. 
So tomorrow, after you've got- 
ten tired of answering the door for 
all those candy-starved kids or 
you've drunk that last bit of the 
strange-tasting punch at the party, 
there's something you must do. Pop 
some popcorn or bake some pump- 
kin seeds, grab a pillow and/or a 
blanket, dim the lights, turn up the 
volume on the television and play 
the scariesl film you can get your 
hands on 

These terrifying films have 
played an active role in many of 
their viewers' most horrible night- 
mares Yet, many of these films have 
also changed (he lives of the actress- 
es who play in them. Some of the 
effects launched actresses into 
promising careen, while others put 
an end to them 

Let's start with the positive out- 
comes And since I'm writing this 
article, I'll start with my favorite, 
Jamie Lee Curtb This woman 
was known as the "Scream Queen" 
for years, after getting started in a 
small, independent 1978 film, 
"Halloween." With a budget of only 
$300,000, the film, which launched 
rive sequels, set its heroine blazing 
into stardom Yet, Curtis was no 
one-film wonder. Her success con- 
tinued in such honor-genre films as 
"The Fog," "Prom Night," 
"Halloween 2" and "Terror Train." 
All this should have come to no sur- 
prise to the public, considering her 
motha is Janet Leigh, a star of the 
classic film "Psycho." 

Yet, the "Halloween'' films did 
not always have such a positive 
effect on its stars At ll-years-old, 
Danielle Harris portrayed Jamie 
Loyd in pans four and five of the 
series. Her portrayal as the niece of 
the demented killer Michael Myers 
was out standing, in comparison to 
other actresses who work in such 
films Yet, as ihe movies ended, 
Harris's problems began The 
actress began to be terrorized by a 
stalker herself As a result, she was 
forced to leave the big screen for her 
own protection. If you didn't notice, 



in the latest sequel her character 
returned; she didn't. For those who 
are interested, Harris can be spotted 
in such other films as "Free Willy." 
"Don't Tell Mom the Baby-sitter's 
Dead" and in re-runs of "Roseanne " 

SlaUcing is no coincidence for 
those actresses who choose to per- 
form in scary films Another exam- 
ple would be Heather 
Langenkamp, or Nancy Thompson, 
from the three of the "Nightmare on 
Elm Street" films After concluding 
her second film in the series, she 
was stalked and harassed. 
Fortunately, her stalker was caught 
and put in jail. Many may say her 
events were actually "for the best" 
after all her story was Ihe idea 
behind the latest sequel. Wes Craven 
and she worked together on the 
script for the film which did quite 
well at the box office. 

Surprisingly, many actresses 
were acknowledged for their hard 
work in these films by receiving 
Oscar nominations In Stephen 
King films alone, there were Sissy 
Spacek for "Carrie" and Kalhy 
Bales for "Misery." Who could for- 
get Linda Blair's performance in 
"The Exorcist," a movie where audi- 
ente members were known to leave 
the theater in disgust. Stgourney 
Weaver will soon be seen in anoth- 
er installation of the "Alien" fran- 
chise, a film she received a nomina- 
lion for in 1981. And while many 
people may have thought Anthony 
Hopkin's portrayal as Hannibal 
Lecture in 1990's "Silence of the 
Lambs " was magnificent, that did- 
n't stop Ihe Academy from awarding 
Jodie Foster an award for her por- 
trayal as Clarice Starling There are 
a few actress who seem to know 
nothing else but horror films: yet, 
their careers do keep strong. Dee 
Wallace Stone has become a diva of 
these films. Some of her credits 
include: "The Hills Have Eyes" 
"Howling," "Cujo." "Popcorn," 
"I'm Dangerous Tonight" and more 
recently "The Frighteners." Besides 
playing the mother in "ET," these 
films have kept this woman afloat 

Nevertheless, most actresses 
tend to start with scary films and 
then move on in Hollywood. It's 
amazing to discover how many 
actresses followed this hypothesis 
Before becoming an Academy 
award nominee. Elisabeth Shue 
was being attacked by a killer goril- 



la in "Link." Before "True 
Romance" and "Wild Flower." 
Patricia Arquette flipped out in "A 
Nightmare on Elm Street: The 
Dream Warriors ." Alexandra Paul 
saved lives in "Baywatcb" only after 
surviving "Christine." Linda 
Hamilton had to figbl off demented 
kids in "The Children of the Com" 
before lakjng on "The Terminator ." 
Finally there were two ladies who 
would eventually become "Thelma 
&amp; Louise." Yet, first while Susan 
Sarandon sang in "Rocky Horror 
Picture Show," Geena Davis was 
swatting away in "The Fly." 

Next, we have those who 
became famous and decided lo try 
the scary route to see what they 
missed. Winona Ryder got all 
dressed up for "Bram Stoker's 
"Dracula." Michelle Pfeiffer look a 
bite in "Wolf" "Veronica's Closet" 
star Klrstie Alley took a tnp to the 
"Village of ihe Damned" Virginia 
Mml-. n looked al her reflection in 
"The Candyman." Drew 
Barrymore put the "Boys on the 
Side" and started lo "Scream." 
Gabrielle Anwar got tired of 
smelling the "Scenl of a Woman" 
and decided to fight against the 
invasion of ihe "Body Snatchers." 
While, Julia Roberts got sick of 
"Sleeping with the Enemy" and 
decided lo play "Mary Reilly." The 
list goes on an on. 

So, who will be the next big 
screen sensations after their horror 
film days have seized. Is it possible 
that "Party" girl Neve Campbell's 
performances in "Scream" and "The 
Craft" are strong enough 10 set this 
actress's career rolling After already 
winning an Academy Award, could 
Mira Sorvino's performance in this 
summer's "Mimic" lead her to better 
parts or just back lo "Romy and 
Michelle's High School Reunion." 
Will we remember Jennifer Love- 
Hewitt after "I Know What You Did 
Lasi Summer?" Time will tell. 

So. if you take my advice and 
walch a few scary movies mis week- 
end, be on the look out. First, you 
may be viewing the sian of a bud- 
ding cari.er. Or second, you may 
come across a well-known actress at 
her beginning stages. Finally, third, 
while they say "it's only a movie," 
for some of these actresses, the ter- 
ror only staned there. 

Have a fun, yel terrifying 
Halloween.

how I can get so wrapped up in 
sports when they're only games 
played by multi-millionaires who 
couldn't care less about preserving 
the integri- 
ty of those 

games. ^^^^^^^^fffSS

money, once in a while I. too, get 
caught up in bashing professional 
sports. 

Then a single moment in time 
comes along and makes me realize 
why I've obsessed over these trivial 
games for a great majority of my 
life. 

Sunday it was seeing Hector 
Renteria jaunt joyfully to first after 
slapping a line-dnve over Charles 
Nagy to drive in the winning run 

It was watching Marlins' man- 
ager Jim Leyland point up to bis 
wife after winning his first champi- 
onship in 34 



than 24 hours after 
leading bis team to the World 
Series tide the talk of manger 
Jim Leyland leaving the team 
has already begun. 

There was a time 
when at least a week would 
go by before people would 
stan talking about their soul 
being for sale to the highest 
bidder. 



•The top five things that I won't sec by the end of 
the year 

5. The Bears and Colts making the playoffs. 
4 Rodman winning an emmy for his acting skills 
3. People actually believing that Deion "the 
Saint" Sanders wants to become a preacher 




2 The Clinton administration having as many 

people arrested as players at Ohio Stale. 

1 Marge Schot marrying Louis Farrakhan at a 

synagogue. 

■Jim "Rocky" Harbaugb showed that not only 
does he suck at football but he also can't box 
either when he punched Jim "I am old enough to 
collect Social Security" Kelly. Harbaugb broke 
his band after punching Kelly because of com- 
ments that he made about Harbaugh being a baby 
about his injuries. 

•Jorge Lugo gets my "dumbass of the week" 
award when he tossed a glass of ice at Charles 
"Gbandi" Barkley • Being the pacifist that he is 
"Sir Charles" threw Lugo through the from win- 
dow of the bar and told him, "You got what you

Scandal on Capitol Hill 



For the first time all 



SEASON, I SAT THROUGH A 



COMPLETE BASEBALL GAME 



N 



AND REALIZED THERE S 



NOTHING BETTER THAN A 



WELL-EXECUTED 



HIT-AND-RUN. 



until 
Sunday 
night 

For the 
first lime 
all season. I 
sal through 
a complete 
baseball 
game and 
realized 
there's 
nothing 
belter than 
a well-exe- 
cuted hit- 
and-run. ^^^^^^vi 

I'm not 
the biggest 

baseball fan in the world and to tell 
the truth, the sport isn't one of my 
favorites, but as I sat through all 11 
innings during game seven of the 
World Series. 1 remembered what it 
felt like when I was in Litde League 
— pitching under the lights. 

1 might have only been 13 and 
playing on a little diamond in 
Woodbum. but my imagination kept 
idling me that there were three on 
and two outs in the bottom of the 
ninth and I was pitching for the 
World Series. 

When baseball is played well 
there isn't anything bener. 

Especially when Bob Cosias is 
doing play-by-play. 

The way his voice portrays the 
plush green grass of the infield bor- 
ders on perfection. 

Through all 11 innings, collec- 
tive bargaining, contract negotia- 
tions, holdouts, salary caps and free 
agency were meaningless and clutch 
hits, turning two, stealing third, sac 
flies and squeeze bunts are at the 
forefront. 

People wonder why this country 
is so fascinated with the world of 
sports. They talk about the sheer 
greed of wbiny millionaires who get 
paid to do what ibey love. 

Even though I'm all for Dennis 
Rodman's right to bold out for more 



years of pro- 
f e s s i on al 
baseball and 
mouthing "I 
love you." 

Sunday 
night just 
summed up 
my pure love 
for sports. The 
drama is bet- 
ter than any 
episode of ER 
and you fall in 
love with the 
characters 
faster than in 
any Shakes- 
pearian play 

They 
might play on 
a different 
stage, but the 
situations 
throughout all 
seven games 
couldn't bave 
been written 
any better by 
Neil Simon.
