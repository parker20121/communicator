- Hi 



Why can't the United stales 
control the flow of drugs into the 
country? 

Drug growers outside 
are not regulated bv 
governments, so they ca 
their goods to the U 
much difficulty. It is im. 
the U.S. to regulate the drug trade 
within other countries without vio- 
lating international law. 

Also, drugs are a major cash 
crop for many South American 
countries. If the production of 
drugs by peasant growers would be 
cut, governments fear this would 
throw the growers into economic 
disarray and push them into the 
hands of anti-government forces. 

The American government h. isn't 



have been suggosird 
plemented, but this is now 
the type of punishment 
deter drug traffickers. 



Not enough govej nmenl hinds 
are being used for the drug war It 

targeted for defense would he u-rd 

lor the war on drills, peril, i|is there

this country. If the war on drugs is 
truly a war, then money from de- 
fense spending would he rightly 
used for deterrence of illegal ilmr, 
transport. 

Even if resources were made 
available to prevent drug trade. 
there is no guarantee that the 
money would reach the (oderal 
agencies on the front line of the 
drug war, such ;.is the Drug Kn-
