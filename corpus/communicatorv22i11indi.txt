HERE'S WHY 

THE SMART MONEY AT 

INDIANA UNW-PURDUE UNTV AT FT. WAYNE 

IS GOING WITH TIAA-CREF 

AS IF THE FUTURE DEPENDED ON IT. 





Because it does. Smart investors 
know that your future depends on 
how well your retirement system 
performs. TIAA-CREF has been the 
premier retirement system for people 
in education and research for over 70 
years. We have enabled over 200,000 
people like you to enjoy a comfortable 
retirement. And over 1,000,000 more 
are now planning for the future with 
TIAA-CREF. 

SMART MONEY LOOKS FOR SECURITY, 
GROWTH AND DIVERSITY FOR 
RETIREMENT SAVINGS. 
Security— so the resources are there 
when it is time to retire. Growth— so 
you'll have enough income for the 
kind of retirement you want. And 
diversity— to help protect you against 
market volatility and to let you benefit 
from several types of investments. 

THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET 
WITH TIAA-CREF. 
T1AA offers you the safety of a 
traditional annuity that guarantees 
your principal plus a specified rate of 
interest, and provides for additional 



growth through dividends. CREF's 
variable annuity offers opportunities 
for growth through four different 
investment accounts, each managed 
with the long-term perspective essen- 
tial to sound retirement planning: 
The CREF Stock Account 
The CREF Money Market Account 
The CREF Bond Market Account 
The CREF Social Choice Account
