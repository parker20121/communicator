Board may nol always parallel the student body's tasles closely enough. SUB 
members mighl contend that the students have elected them as their 
representatives and therefore have already had their chance for input in the 
election process. 

We feel, however, that soliciting sludenl input lur fulure concerts would nol be 
a hardship for SUB members and would allow the average sludenl a chance to 
more actively participate in campus activities If all the concerts lor this year have 
not already been contracted, the soliciting could begin soon in the lorrn of ballots 

The Communicator would be willing lo allocate free space for I his interact ions 
if the proposal appeals in students and the Sludenl Union Board. SUB members 
could compile a list of available groups in their price range, publish It in the 
newspaper, and ask students to lisl their choices Students could return their 
ballots for tabulation and the Union Board, with ibis information in hand, could 
then book bands whose schedules would permit them to appear here. 
Meager attempts at this sort of interaction huve occurred in the past, but the 
ballots were not widely circulated. A cooperative effort between The 
Communicator and the Student Union Board would allow for greater feedback in 
this use of student activity fee money.
