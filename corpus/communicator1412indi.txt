Aid should not 
be tied to age 



Rallying cry for southpaws 



Members of 'oppressed minority' speak out 



si Southpawi 



Last August, the State Student 
Assistance Commission or Indiana 
fSSACh. adopted a change in rules 
governing how state financial aid should 
be awarded, that could cost a tot of 
students money 

Students are now required to be at 
least 22 years old by Jan. 1, 1983 to claim 
Independence from their parents, unless 
they arc orphaned or wards of the court 

Usually, those who are financially 
independent of Ihcir parents are eligible 
for more financial old. 

SSACI director Shcryl Tlndal said 
students who claimed independent 
status before Ihc change will have their 
state awards revoked for the next 
semes tor. 

Because of Indiana's economic 
troubles, the SSACI cannot award as 
much aid as before, so It looks for 
students who deserve aid the most. If 
this is true, requiring a student to be 22 
to claim independence seems more like 
an excuse than a legitimate reason for 
SSACI to award less aid. 

Here's an example of what could 
happen: 

. Suppose Mary Lou Public, the 
daughter of two parents who together 
earn 525,000 a year, graduates from high 
school and enlers college while working 
a part-time job. After a year, she decides 
to move into an apartment with two 
olher women while continuing to work 
and attend closscs Because she supports 



herself and pays for her college 
education, Mary Lou proves she is 
deserving in the eyes of SSACI and is 
awarded slate financial aid This award 
might be all that makes college possible 
for her because she doesn't have to 
budget as much out of her paychecks as 
she used to to pay for three credit hour 
classes. Suddenly, the aid is stripped. 
What did she do wrong? Her income is 
still the same and her grades have not 
slipped. The problem is that Mary Lou Is 
only 20. 

So far as we know, Mary Lou is fic- 
titious, but this change will rob many 
fleshand-blood students or needed 
money for education. 

By requiring students to be 22 to claim 
independence. SSACI is ignoring many 
students who truly deserve stale 
financial aid. 

If someone under 22 is independent 
and is going to college, he or she should 
be Just as eligible as any other student to 
receive financial aid. 

What about those students claiming 
independence because their parents 
cannot pay for their education? These 
students should not have to wait until 
they are 22 to be able to attend college. 

If Ihc SSACI is looking for students 
who deserve financial aid, it should 
remember that more and more people 
under 22 are taking on the respon- 
sibilities of providing themselves with 
both a home and an education.
