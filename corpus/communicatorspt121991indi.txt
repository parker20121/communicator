Quarterly crime report released 

Rates top last year's totals 



Dental programs 
re-accredited 



By Heather Washington 
Staff Writer 

Keep a padlock on those valuables. Make a list 
of brand names and serial numbers. Don't label 
your keys. These are among suggestions given 
by university police to help protect your personal 
items from thieves. The second 1991 quatlerly 
crime report for IPFW was released by police and 
safety recently. The report lists a total of 33 per- 
sonal thefts during the first six months of 1991. 
Faculty and students reported 37 personal thefts 
during the entire 1990 calendar year. Other 
reported crimes included two auto thefts, one 
incident of battery, seven bomb threats, and six 
incidents of vandalism, all topping last year's total 
reports, except vandalism. 

"You can speculate," says IPFW Director of 
Police and Safety Stephen Roby, "{the reason for 
the rise in personal thefts) might be the econo- 
my." During the past year, Roby said, most thefts 
were traced to the same two or three individuals, 
"We think that's been the case this past 
semester," Roby continued. 

The majority of property stolen during the past 
six months was money. Wallets and purses 
accounted for 34 percent ot the thefts. Backpacks 
filled with books were stolen near the end of the 
semester, when used texts are returned for mon- 
ey at the bookstore. Personal equipment, bicy-

IPFW'S dental hygiene, dental assist- 
ing and dental laboratory technology 
programs alt received re-accteditation 
early this semester. All three programs 
were vigorously scrutinized by the 
Commission on Denial Accreditation 
and earned praising reviews. 

Accredilalion is vital to both the pro- 
grams themselves and to the campus' 
reputation. Most programs and univer- 
sities want accreditation because it 
helps attract studenis and funding. 

According to Ihe program director, 
Peter Zonakis, the process was an in- 
depih look al each ot Ihe programs. A 
commission examined the budget, the 
equipment and the facililies of the 
school Each course was analyzed lor 
content They interviewed students to 
determine their success in obtaining 
certification Irom the stale and 
checked with the dental community 
on Ihe reputation of the programs 
and the graduates. 

'Accreditation is usually a review 
process Ihat applies lo professionally 
oriented academic programs,' said 
David McCanis, Acting Vice-Chancel- 
lor for Academic Affairs. However, the 
campus as a whole also receives an 
accreditation review every seven 
years. A campuswide accreditation 
review includes a look at the university- 
mission stalameni. The association 
then determines whether or noi the 
university is luHilling that mission, said 
McCanls. 'Various programs are 
reviewed along with examination ol the 
fiscal policies, administrative policies, 
siudent affairs policies and a compre- 
hensive look al Ihe quality ol the facul- 
ty, "said McCanls. 

For the dental programs' review, a 
team ol seven prolessionals from all 
over the United Slates formed the 
commission. Atler gathering their find- 
ings, they submitted a review lor the 
state's appn^val. 
All three dental programs have been 



cles, and automobiles made up the remaining 38 
percent of reported thefts. 

To help deter the amount of thefts due to "care- 
lessness or inattentiveness" Roby suggests that 
lockers which require a refundable quarter 
deposit be purchased by the university and 
placed near the bookstore entrance. Student sup- 
port is needed to persuade the university to make 
such a purchase. Currently, security officers 
patrol the store during registration week when the 
bookstore is crowded. 

University crime rates are lower than last year's 
statistics. The average loss in the five incidents of 
stolen university properly during the first six 
months of this year was $50.00. There were 18 
campus proper^ thefts reported during the 1990 
calendar year. 

Physical threats and robbery remain virtually 
nonexistent on the IPFW campus according to 
Roby 

USA Today formulated a Crime Index Hate to 
judge 481 colleges nationwide concerning 
campus safety in areas of aggravated assult, 
rape, murder, robbery, burglary, larceny-theft, 
and motor vehicle theft in 1990. The national 
crime index average was 26 incidents per 
1,000 students. With an index number of 4.7, 
IPFW held the lowest index of all Indiana col- 
leges in the study. 



accredited since the lale 19603. 

The dental laboratory technology pro- 
gram is the only accredited program of 
its kind in Indiana. Charles Champion. 
Ihe program's director, explained, °A 
dental lab technician fabricates fixed 
and removeable prosthetic appliances 
like complete dentures, crowns, 
bridges, and orthodontic appliances.' 

Without the accreditation, students 
graduating from the programs would 
not be able to take the State board 
examinations, which allow the stu- 
dents to become certified in their 
field- Zonakis said, 'The program is 
very successful. Our graduates are 
in great demand." 

Zonakis expressed his appreciation 
for the local dental community lor their 
suppon and involvement in the pro- 
grams. Many of the professors in the 
dental programs are prolessionals from- 
the community. This allows the stu- 
dents lo be exposed to real-life experi- 
ences, he said. 

Carol Haney. assistant to Zonakis, 
was pleased with the program's ability 
to overcome Ihe obstacles it faced. 
"We're hiampered by space but 
we've turned it into a positive rather 
than a negative. Students get to 
know each other better and the stu- 
dent-teacher ratio is lower, creating 
a close-knit group." 

Haney also expressed a concern 
about campus awareness of Ihe pro- 
grams. Not very many people are 
aware of the programs offered by Ihe 
school and even less are aware that 
a Hygiene Clinic exists where low- 
cost denial cleaning and x-rays are 
offered to the community through the 
program, she said. 

Many campus programs are 
accredited, according to McCants, 
like the music, business, education, 
engineering and technology pro- 
grams. The IPFW campus as a 
whole received a successful accredi- 
tation report just last year. 




St Joseph River Valley exploration 

Archeological survey to reveal human effect on environment 



By Tina Holston, Editor In Chief 
There will be an early fall this year 
according to the Farmers Almanac and 
that may be just what Robert Jeske, 
ass&lt;.slant protessor ol anihropology, is 
hoping lor. Alter the crops are har- 
vested, his archaeok)gical survey of the 
St Joseph River Valley can continue. 

Jeske received a $30,000 grant Imm 
the Indiana Department ot Natural 
Resources last June lo conduct his sur- 
vey . Through this survey Jeske hopes 
to discover sites ol human behavior 
tram the past revealing environmental 
changes due lo human inhabitancy. 
The survey 'universe' Is a ten kilome- 



ter wide by 40 kilometer long corridor 
extending along the St. Joe River from 
just northeast of Fort Wayne to the 
Ohio border, an area ol about 5,000 
acres. In 1983 a similar study was 
done on about 400 acres ol the valley. 

"The purpose of the survey is lo 
locate archaeological sites in a con- 
trolled, sysiematic fashion,' sakj Jeske. 
who has been teaching at IPFW for 
four years. 'It is to provide data of land 
use patterns through time and lo devel- 
op a model for environmental effect on 
where people place their (living) site.* 

Since the area is mostly farm land, 
Jeske and his crew of four students 



walk Ihe fields searching for arlifacts 
which are used in dating sites. 
There is no excavation work al this 
level," Jeske said. "We date sites so 
then changes that occur through time 
on a populated location can be stud- 
ied." Jeske hopes to get future furKt- 
ing to conduct the second level of 
research which may include excava- 
tion of some sites. 

"There are two ways lo examine envi- 
ronmental change,* he said. 'One is 
based on time and the other is based 
on social ladors like population density 
among others." 

According to Jeske there are boih 



practical and academic appllcalnns to 
the results of such a study. "We will 
study soil type, site distance from the 
river, vegelation zones and 11 other 
variables lo determine which sites have 
an affect on the environment. Aside 
Irom the academic stuff, we will be giv- 
ing the stale a tool they can use when 
Ihay make cultural resource manage- 
ment decisions," he satd. 

The Historic Preservation Review 
Board, of which Jeske is a member, 
evaluates Ihe effects on historical sites 
and makes recommendations as &lt;o fur- 
Iher archaeological work. 'They may 
require a davaloper to do mtligalion,' 



he said. They may be required to relo- 
cate development or to excavate a site 
before developmerrt, or Ihe board may 
decide ihere are no importanl sites 
found In the area so devetopment may 
proceed uninhibited,* he said. 

Jeske and his crew have been walk- 
ing the liekjs ol northeast Indiana sinca 
last June and have already located 60 
sites, "We are about half done,' he 
said. 'But the crops got too high and 
we could no longer sea the ground. 
Jeske hopes to complete the project by 
next June. 'Bui for now, we will have 
to wait until October when Ihe crops 
come out to begin work again.*

Alternatives 



Exclusive use of testing 
doesn't moke the grade 



ThQ collag© student's nighlmaro: 
"You're final grade in ihis class will be 
determined by the final exam given 3t 
8 a.m., Dec. 16,' 

A whole class' wotlh ol knowledge 
crammed Into one test to be taken at 6 
in Ihe morning? Some college stu- 
dents never see the 6 o'clock hour on 
their alarm clock because they are 
usually sllll astesp. And piofessors 
expect sludenls not only to be awake 
bul In lull command of Iheir mental fac- 
ulties, too? The stress ol Christmas 
won't even curve the scale. 

Here's anotliot horror story: The 
IntelligenI student who diligently stud- 
ies lor a lesl at least a week ahead of 
time only to come lo Ihe exam and 
totally blank out. 

What about Ihe professor who asks 
queslions never even asked. 1st alone 
answered, in class? Maybe you are 
terrible at True and False tests but 
excellent at essay tests; maybe you 
hale lill in the blank tests, 

Testing is not an adequate evaluation 
ol a person's knowledge. 

Testing, if even used in a class, 
should account for a small percent- 
age of a student's grade. In the edu- 
cational syslem we have so many 
achievers' people who ulilize their 
recall ability just to pass tests. They 
theh promptly forget all the informa- 
tion until Ihey have to memorize it 
again for the linal exam. 

Prolessors have two choices facing 



Ihem: allow Ihe achievers lo pass Iheir 
class supposedly having learned 
something; or structure ihe grade so it 
(eflects Ihe actual knowledge acquired. 
Students would have lo think twice 
about "passing time" in college class- 
es. They would actually have lo learn 
something. 

II pfolessots choose la allow achiev- 
ers success based on their learned 
test-taking abilities, then students are 
headed for failure. II prolessors 
choose lo adopt objectives that can be 
measured in other ways, this University 
will produce more inlelligent people. 

Alternatives to lest taking are class 
participation, speeches, personal inter- 
views held at appropriate times during 
the semester, papers or debates. 
Nothing could be a belter gage ol 
acquired knowledge than Ihe regurgita- 
tion ol knowledge. These alternatives 
allow Ihe students to learn from the 
professor and restate the knowledge in 
their own words: evidence that the 
knowledge has been assimilated. 

Whatever Ihe teacher chooses as 
an alternative to evaluating what the 
student knows, more than one alter- 
native should be utiiiied to account 
(or personal differences. Not every- 
one can present an excellent speech 
or defend a point under fire, bul one 
way or another can be an, adequate 
gage lor evaluating a student's 
acquired knowledge.

To the Editor: 

Warning! Use of this product may 
prove serious lo your health. No, I am 
not referring to smoking, red dye #2, or 
asbestos. I am referring lo your use of 
this campus. 

Are you aware that from December of 
1990 to Ihe present there have bean 
two university police positions open 
and budgeted tot but which have 
remained unlilled? As a result this 
campus does not have 24-hoi)r police 
coverage. In fact, our university police 
lorce has two less officers than n did 
when Keltler Hall was Ihe only building 
oncampusi 

This situation is inexcusatile. Not only 
is Ihe lack of a suflicieni police force a 
disservice to the members of this aca- 
demic community, but this university 
has allowed a misconception lo exist 
among the public, as they believe that 
odicers are on campus 24 hours a day 
and in sufficient strength lo respond to 
their needs and handle all situations 
that arise. Presently there are several 



times throughout the day when we 
have a security officer working alone 
wjthoul a police officer on duty. While 
we appreciate the additional eyes and 
ears that these security ollicers provide 
the police department, it serves no pur- 
pose when there is no commissioned 
police olficer available to respond if 
trouble should arise. At present, based 



on the police department's own figures, 
there are 48 hours each week or 2S.5 
percent ol the week, in which there is 
no police coverage. 

The tact that our University has had a 
history of a relatively low crime rate 
cannot be used as an indication that 
this "luck" will remain. The very fact 
that this University, or pans thereof. Is

open on a 24-hour basis makes It civilly 
liable if an incident should occur at a 
lime when there is no police coverage 
available. 

This outrage must be corrected. The 
money to pay (or additional police olfi- 
cers exists and has been budgeted for. 
There are candidates to fill these posi- 
tions. In short, there is no excuse for 
the present situation. 

As a student on this campus. I can 
assure this University that I will hold It 
dvilty liable for my safety. As a parent, 
I can assure this University that I will 
not allow my son or daughter to attend 
this campus until I can be assured Ihat 
it Is as sale as il can and should be. As 
a citizen of this communily, I can 
promise this University that I will make 
every attempt lo bring this situation lo 
the attention of the community at large 
and to discourage any parent (rom 
sending their son or daughter lo IPFW

Student storytellers make class a living 



There's one in every class. He, she or 
it sits in the (rant row and blabs con- 
stantly interrupting the class with point- 
less comments and dopey questions. 

He, she or it is the one who runs on 
perpetually about how his life was 
changed so much after his summer trip 
to New York City, or the one who woni 
stop talking about how her little Debbie 
keeps eating from the cat litter boj. or 
the one who can't shut up about its 
mysierious itch. 

There's one in every class and some- 
times there's two or three. This is the 
nightmare I sutler through in my psy- 
chology class. 

The ring leader of these behemoth- 
mouths is a middle-aged woman who 
looks a helluva lot like Bob Dylan with 
a shoulder-length hair-sprayed bob. 
Miss Manners doesnt even bother with 
the courtesy of raising her hand t&gt;efore 




Obtruse Angle 



she so rudely interrupts the professor 
with a thoughtless burp ol a statement. 

She even talks like Bob Dylan playing 
a big city cab driver. "So should we 
write dis down?" she asks at three- 
mlnule intervals, sounding a kit like a 
taxi driver saying *So where to, mac?' 

And there's this guy who sits two 
seats away from her in the front row. 
He's lived a lull life, and ha remem- 
bered everything that he experienced 
along the way. So why not pass these 
findings on lo the resi ol Ihe class? 
'And then I put my goat badt out in Ihe 
barn," he sometimes says m conclu- 
sion lo yel another story that somehow 
fit in with Ihe lecture on Post-Traumatic 
Stress Syndrome. 

And then there's another woman who 
is determined to bring up issues for 



psychology. "I doni think we should 



have to give out our Social Security 
number to the bookstore,' she said 
during a discussion on behaviorism. 

So I'm keeping a chart on how many 
questions/comments are made by 
these jerks. I'm keeping detailed slats 
in several categories including com- 
ments Ihat draw hoots and jeers from 
other students, questions that make 
Ihe professor visibly anxious, and com- 
ments that extend the length ol the 
class period lor live minutes or longer. 

So far Ihe gruff-bul-loveable Cabbie 
lady has pulled out to an early lead 
with 25 points. 1 have one point myself 
because the professor saw me slretch- 
ing and thought I had a question, so I 
made one up. "Will this be on the lest?" 
I asked in my best Bob Dylan nasal 
whine* 

TTiere's one in every class.

College Cable Channel 6 gets grant 



By Heather Washington 
Staff Writer 

Channel 6. a college cable-access 
station offenng a cornucopia of pro- 
grams to the Fori Wayne area, 
recently received a grant to enhance 
Its programing. The City of Fort 
Wayne's Cable Television Program- 
ming Council (CATPC) allotted Ihe 
station S46.700 recently in the sec- 
ond ol three installments. 

The total grant amount is nearly 
$100,000. This second allotment will 
be used lo install a new master control 
and organizational unit into Ihe current 
Channel 6 main ollice located in the 
basement of Helmke Library. The mas- 
ter control devices consist ol equip- 
ment such as monitors, lape decks and 
a time-base corrector. 

The director of Channel 6, Bernie 
Lohmuller, said CATPC is a council 
consisting of the mayor of Fort Wayne 
and 9 or ten city council members. 
According to Lohmultef, not-for-profit 



stations like Channel 6 submit giani 
requests and make recommendations 
based on each station's exhibition ol 
responsibility. "(CATPC) tries to work 
with us to meet our needs in producing 
tocal programming,' said Lohmuller. 

The council meets monthly and 
grants are usually given annually or 
semi-annually in installments. Chan- 
nel 6'5 first grant installment received 
this year was S39.372. Lohmuller 
expects the last installment to bs 
around S12,000, 

Lohmuller, previously Ihe assislani 
director ol IPFW's Learning Resource 
Center, became the Channel 6 director 
one year ago. Lohmuller, along with 
Production l!&gt;30'dinalof Gregg Schmitz 
and two work-sludy students, make up 
the paid stall for the station. Many stu- 
dent volunteers help produce the 109 
hours ol programming originated by Ihe 
station weekly. 

The station's program guide reffects a 
broad spectrum ol interests. Last year.

Review: This Mortal Coil's "Blood" record is specturcl, beautiful 



By Chad Hasting 
Fealures Edilor 
This Mortal Coll 

Blood 
4A.D. RecordB 
There are soma records Ihat sound 
besi ai very paillcular Ilrrias and 
piQcaa. The lltsl Van Halen record, (or 
instance, was mads lo be played on 
the Vf3y to a lake weekend with a car 
full ol liiends and a cooler lull ol beer. 
Randy Travis' songs ara 7 a.m. music, 
Rasing you into Iha day as you gat 
raady lor work, REM's "ll's Ihe 

End ol tha Wo/Id as we Know ll" 
inslanTly lights up a packed (ralernily 
party. 

The lime and placa for This Mortal 
Coil's new record, "Blood,* is a familiar 
one for Ihose ol us not blessed with air 



conditioning. Play 'Bbod' al midnight 
on a humid summer evening, just 

before you slide into iMd. It will provide 
Ihe perlecl backing for the nighl's 
dreaming. The hushed (ones might 
quiet your mind, but Ihe emotions are 
hoi and fevered. 

This Mortal Coll isn't really a band, 
but a rotating cast o! playets Irom acts 
on BiHain's 4 A.D. record label. Two 
men are credited with writing and play- 
ing most ol the music. The vocals, 
though, ara traded among three 
singers - Caroline Crawley, Oeirdre 
Rutowski and Alison Limerick - and Ihe 
emotions on "Blood" come Irom them. 

The instrumentation changes on 
almost every song, letting the songs' 
shapes shift. The band will use a song 
of one particular mood to set up Ihe 



next, which will have an entirely oppo- 
site emotion. The opening tune. "Lace- 
maker.' weaves darkness and tight with 
a string quartet. Cello notes sway back 
and (orth. then give way to the violins' 
light melody. The metody cuts off Ihen, 
sharply, leaving jusi the cello's rhythm 
underneath Crawley's vocals on "Mr. 
Somewhere," 'Somewhere' is about 
playing around, trying to create an 
emotional storm lo disturb your person- 
al stasis. "Almost beat the milkman to 
Ihe door," Crawley sings. Her wish, 
though. Is 'To get out, take the tide, 
any tide/but there won't be any tide . , . 
I am Mr. Somewhere, missing some- 
where.* 

'With Tomorrow" offers hope, 
couched in a beautiful piano melody.

Student, Cosby co-own champion dogs 



By KelllE. Beery 
Copy Editor 

What do Ranaie Moore, an IPFW 
English major, and Bill Cosby have in 
common? The answer is a bunch of 
Lakeland Terriers . 

It all slarled for Moore back In 1978 
when she decided lo show Greal 
Danes In dog compelHions. Alter all ol 
her Greal Danes became champions, 
Moore decided to invest in a smaller 
breed ol dog because the Great Danes 
had loo many problems, according to 
Moore. Her nexl choice were Miniature 
Pinschers, who were quile a bit smaller 
ihan Greal Danes al only 12 Inches 
high at' (he shoulders and weighing 
only seven to nine pounds. Moore 
decided thai Miniature Pinschers didn't 
suit her personald/ either. So Moore 
bought a Welsh Teiner, which she now 
owns three champion Welsh Terriers. 

But how does Bill Cosby (il in? When 
Moore was al a dog show, she saw the 
Lakeiand Terriers and decided that she 
wanted them to show. But actually get- 
ting a Lakeland Terrier wasn't as easy 
as it sounds. 

'When you're buying a dog,' said 
Moore, 'and you think you're going to 
stick with that breed, you want to start 
with the very best you can: the best 
breed, Iha best temperament. 
Because il you're going to go on and 
breed that, you want lo have some- 
thing really solid to star! with. And 
everyone told me that Capl. Jean 
Heath and Bill Cosby bred the best 
Lakelands* 

The story goes that Heath and Cosby 
were In the Navy together (or over 20 
years and formed a Iriendship before 
breeding dogs together Moore contin- 
ued. "So I contacted her (Heath) by 
phone and talked to her. We hit il off 
and she checked my references. 
Apparently 1 checked out OK. She was 
showing a bitch at the lime called Black 
Watch (Heath and Cosby's kennel 
name] Tangaroo. I really loved the 
bitch, and I told her I wanted a puppy 
out ol that biich. She didn't take the 
first time so I ended up waiting almost 
two years before I got Vanessa." 

Vanessa was so named alter the 
:Vanessa character on "The Cosby 
Show.' 

'I Ixjughl her outright," Moore stated, 
"and when rl was lime lo show her, we 
made an agreement that they would 
co-own her with me and Ihey showed 
her for two years. She got her champi- 
onship in one weekend, and then she 
went out and was specialed and 
gained points." 

How special is Vanessa for getting 
her championship in one weekend? 
According lo Moore, in order (or a dog 
to get a championship, thai dog has to 
accumulate IS points over a period ol 
lime. Points are received by a dog 
depending on the number of dogs they 
beat in one show. The most points a 
dog can receive in one show is J5. 
Moore stated that Vanessa won three 
five-poinl shows in one weekend. 

The achievement is more delined 
when Moore slated that the shows 
were at Montgomery County, the 
biggest terrier show in the United 
States featuring over 2,000 lerriers and 
60 to 80 Lakelands, Vanessa eventu-

ally went on lo win Best-in-Show. 
which means Ihat out ol all those dogs, 
she was chosen as Ihe best dog there. 
She was also awarded the Best-ol- 

Winners. which means that she was 
Ihe best ol any olher class ol dog. And 
as Moore will boast, "This was Ihe lirsl 
lime she was seriously shown." 

Two years ago, Vanessa was retired 
lo come bach lo Moore to see what she 
could produce. 

According lo Moore, 'A mark ol a 
champion is not just what Ihey couW do 
out in Ihe lield on Ihe showgrounds, but 
what they can produce. II they pro- 
duce themselves or better, then that is 
considered a mark ol a champion, and 
we were thrilled with her lirst litter ol 
four Ihat all four ware of show quality.' 

I asked her how she knew Ihe litter 
was show quality whan they weren't 
even grown yet. Moore replied, 'You 
look at the puppies at eight weeks and 
12 weeks and make your cnlique then. 
Because after 12 weeks they kind ol go 
into an ugly "teenage' period where 
they gel long legs and thin bodies. ... II 
you look at them al 6 weeks and 12 
waaks, you can prelly much tell what 
you're going lo end up with," 

Moore's crilique was on largel (or the 
now 15-month-otd puppies because 
one is slarling his show career soon, 
and out ol Ihe three bitches, two are 
already champions and one has only 
two more shows lo win and she will 
become a champion. 

Vanessa is also credited with another 
inter. These puppies are eight weeks 
old and are starling Iheir training with 



Moore, 

The dogs' success isn't innate, how- 
ever. Moore has spent time each and 
every day training and grooming Ihe 
show dogs. 

"This just isn't an overnight phe- 
nomenon. I've worked so Jong and 
hard on my dogs and really care about 
Ihem,' 

Her long hours aren't only because ot 
the grooming and training, though. 

'I study the pedigrees (ancestry line) 
I keep files on Ihem. I write people for 
pedigrees, I keep old pictures. II in my 
pedigree, I can find a picture of one ol 
the ancestors, I try and get il and keep 
It because ihal's |ust all part ol rt. You 
have to know pedigrees, you have to 
know who produces what and how it 
(its in with your program. This is not 
luck. Heath slarled over 20 years ago. 
One ol the reasons she is successful is 
thai she has been able to import from 
England some really great Lakelands 
and incorporate Ihem in her line. She's 
the only person in the United States 
who has 10 consecutive Best-in-Show 
dogs." 

Heath, Cosby and Moore's success in 
breeding dogs is showcased by Ihe 
success of Sophie Tucker. She is a 
bitch from Vanessa's lirst litter. 

Moore slated Sophia Tucker's 
accomplishment, 'She won the United 
Stales Lakeland Terrier Club National 
Specialty at Beverly Hills Kennel Club 
this year, Irom the puppy class. She 
beat her father, she beat all the other 
champions, everything, Irom Ihe puppy 
class because she was considered so 
good 



"She's going lo be a t«g winner. ... She 
won the Sweepstakes Ihe day belore 
Santa Barbara over 740 puppies 
She's won. vron. won. We're bringing 
her out as a special at Ihe Montgomery 
County, the largest terrier show in the 
country, as her dsbul as a champion 
special. 

'That's really abnormal lor a young 
dog. She's only 15 months old and 
she's already done all Ihat winning. 
We have real high hopes lor her." 

Winning does nol always mean get- 
ting richer. Moore explained Iho cost 
involved in seriously campaigning 
dogs. In addition to Moore's countless 
hours invested in her dogs, the owners 
pay a handler lo lake the dogs to the 
shows and present Ihem lo the judges. 
Handlers cost anywhere from S50 to 
S75every lime the dog is shown. Then 
there are bonuses dependent on how 
far the dog goes in the competition 
ranging from S50 to S100, The handler 
charges Irom $7 lo $10 dollars a day 
(or board, and some charge (or groom- 
ing. In all, to seriously campaign a 
dog, il costs around 520,000 lo 
S50.000 a year and up. 

That is a good reason to co-own 
dogs, but Moore also owns four Welsh 
and co-owns one Greal Dane wilh 
someone in Florida, in addition lo Ihe 
seven Lakelands co-owned wrih Heath 
and Cosby. 

The Norlheasl Indiana Kennel Club 
will be holding a dog show Iha firsi 
Sunday ol. November at the Coliseum, 
Moore slated that they expect 1,200 lo 
1.500 dogs ol 125 breeds there.

said, 'We're looking forward to the rest

"Sam Nolan is a talented runner, hav-
