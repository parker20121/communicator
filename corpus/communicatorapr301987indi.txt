■'I never took a journalism course in 
my life. " 

That came from Ernie Williams, the 
man who has served as IPFWs jour- 
nalism coordinator for the past four 
years and will retire from that position 
at the end of this academic year. 

Williams began his career in jour- 
nalism in 1945 when he was hired at The 
News-Sentinel as a feature writer, "I 
was supposed to turn out a brightener a 
day," he sold, A brightener usually 
consisted of a feature slory on a local 
citizen with a unique hobby for in- 
stance, or someone stopping in Fort 
Wayne as they traveled across the 
country After that, Williams said, he 
was transferred to the labor and 
business beal al a lime when four 
major strikes, including one at the 
General Electric plant, were occurring 
in Fort Wayne For 15 years Williams 
served as business and labor editor, 
before working as an editorial writer 
tor the paper — a position he had for 
about tour or five years. 

From there Williams moved up to the 
position of assistant editor and was 
finally appointed editor of the paper in 
May 1966, a posilion he had for 16 years 
before retiring in October of 19B2. 

It was aRer his retirement from The 
News-SenUnel that Williams came to 
IPFW to build up the journalism 
program here. He said IPFW's jour- 
nalism nroaram was being run under 
the English and linguistics department. 
The Indiana University Board of 
Trustees asked the I.U.-Bloominglon 
school of journalism to insUll two-year 
programs in all the regional campuses 
to serve as feeder programs for the 
school in Bloomington. When thai 



request came in 1981, IPFW started to 
move journalism out on its own, i 
separate from the English antt 
linguistics department At that point in| 
May 1983, Williams entered the picture. 

He said he has counseled a numtier of I 
students who have either taken the' 
program's journalism classes or ', 
chosen to major in journalism. About 
twelve of those transferred to 
Bloominglon after they finished all the 
course work they could at IPFW, Four 
of his students have received 
Echolarslups, a teat of which Williams 
seems particularly proud considering 
the tough competiLon for journalism 
scholarships. 

One of the tasks the regional cam- 
puses' journalism programs were 
supposed to tackle. Williams said, was 
to set up the same standards that are 
upheld in Bloomington. "1 think they've 
done a pretty good job of it," he said. 

Williams has worked with the l.U. 
school of journalism since the mid-1960s 
and in that time has developed a good 
knowledge of the standards that must 
be met, particularly in hiring faculty. 
The associate faculty that he has hired 
to teach the journalism classes here, he 
said, all have a passionate enthusiasm 
for journalism and writing — an en- 
thusiasm that shows in their teaching. 

Some of the faculty hired include 
Norma Thiele who has taught 
publications at North Side for many 
years and has also taught summer 
journalism classes at I.U.-Bloominglon 
before. Jim James, editor of Bowhunter 
magazine, also teaches writing. 

Carl Hartup, who served as Williams' 
chief photographer when he was editor 
of The News-Sentinel and is now 
graphic, layout and design editor. 
teaches visual communication. 
"Hartup is a very gifted 
photographer," Williams said, 
"because he knows more about light 
than anyone I'm aware of. His 
reputation is simply impeccable." Paul 
Helmke who served as the attorney for 
The News-Sentinel in previews years, 
teaches communications law for the 
program 

"With the kind of associate faculty we 
developed, we really are offering our 
students a quality of teaching that is 
better in some cases than they would 
get in their freshman and sophomore 
years at Bloomington, " Williams said. 



confident. I had some great people 
helping me. We (both Schlueter and I) 
knew it was going to be close," said 
Gregory, 

The first Senate-SUBOG meeting of 
the new presidency will be held at 7:30 
p.m on May 11. 

With the majority of senators and 
members of SUBOG ah-eady involved 
in Student Government, Gregory has 
faced opposilion. "Working with the 
senators and the SUBOG members is 
going to take some breaking in, but 1 
know I can do it. We can work 
together," Gregory said. He continued, 
"(Vice President) Phil Downs and I 
have a real good relationship. We're 
working well together and I feel con- 
fident in that," 

Gregory has already started meeting 



Lupus attacks system 

ByDEBHARMENING 
Copy Editor 

Judy Hill is like any other student — she's looking forward to graduating. 
However, there is one important factor that sets her apart from the others. She has 
the chronic disease Lupus. 

Hill was diagnosed in 19B2 with Lupus, an inflammatory disease that can attack 
either the systematic system or the skin and hair. It is caused by the body's 
allergic reaction to its own antibodies. 

There is no known cure for Lupus. Hill said, but it can be controlled by 
medication; and the disease can go into remission in which case no medication is 
needed for about six months. 

Because Increased activity and high levels of stress aggravate symptoms, Hill 
must maintain a low level of stress and can'L participate in many outside ac- 
tivities. 

Hill keeps busy serving on the board of directors tor the Fort Wayne Lupus 
Foundation and also works on the Lupus Foundation Minority Outreach Com- 
mittee which helps educate the hlspanic and black communities on Lupus. 

The foundation educates the public, organius fund-raisers and sends the 
proceeds to the National Lupus Foundation for research. Hill said. 

One symptom of Lupus is a "butterfly rash" that develops on the face, Hill said. 
The rash, which looks like a mask, gave the disease its name: Lupus, meaning 
"wolf" in Latin. 

Living from day to day is something else Hill has learned from her battle with 
Lupus. "The point ofpower is in the present moment," Hill said. "1 have learned to 
accept that I don't have control over everything." 



Ih the administration at IPFW, "It 
feels really good The meeting with 
Dean Ulmer went great," said 
Gregory. A meeting is scheduled in 
May with Chancellor Wallace, 

Gregory's goals include having a poll 
on the parking lot situation given to all 
studenU, lockers installed in Kettler. 
and Harbor Arbor Days revamped with 
more concerts. Gregory also wants to 
keep the union building from becoming 
an administration office building. 

Gregory will request scheduled office 
hours to be posted tor all officers in 
Students' Government. "I want to get 
rid of the country club attitude in 
Student Government. I want offices 
open to students, and students' opinions 
to be recognized." Gregory said. 

Gregory also wants a secretary In 
Students Government office to take 
messages. He said this has been agreed 
to by Dean Ulmer. 

Al the Students' Government meeting 
May II, Gregory will appoint a 
treasurer, SUBOG chairperson, 
parliamenUrian. and clerk to the 
senate. 




Time to go yet?

Greenway beautified 



By JULIE MAGSAMEN 
Chief Reporter 

River Greenway will be the site for a 
sculpture designed and built by 
students in the IPFW fine arts 
department under the direction of 
Hector Garcia, associate professor of 
fine arts. 

The idea for the sculpture came about 
because of extra monies raised by The 
River Greenway Challenge, a triath- 
lon held annually on the last Sunday 
of September. Sponsored and supported 
by local businesses, the triathlon, now 
in its third year, has been a very suc- 
cessful enterprise for River Greenway. 



This year the River Greenway 
Committee decided to hold a sculpture 
contest with the winning sculpture 
displayed on River Greenway. Garda 
established the guidelines for the 
students lo follow The participants 
then submitted their designs and 
models to the judges. Work on the 
winning sculpture, designed by Phyllis 
SUnley, wiU begin in May. 

Garcia said projects like the sculp- 
ture contest are not only a way (or his 
shjdenis to thank their community, but 
the project also provides valuable 
"hands on" experience for students 
preparing for future shows of their own. 



Senate passes court, 
boxes for student body 

By MICHELE SHAFFER 

Editor-in-Chief 

Thanks to the efforts of Student Senator Steve Elser. IPFW students now have 
free access to an outdoor volleyball court. 

Elser said last spring, Phil Downs, another senator, brought up the idea. When 
school began last fall. Elser revived the idea and proposed -the outdoor volleyball 
courL He met with Chancellor Thomas Wallace and representatives from the 
Physical Plant to set up traitative plana. Elser said the court, which is located near 
the northwest corner of Walb Union Building, is complete, 

Elser said the poles and the net for the court were donated by Aniie Ball, acting 
athletic director. 

The court is tree tor students to use, Elser said. Students do need to sign out the 
rake and ball at Ihe Sweet Shoppe before using the courL The upkeep for the court 
Is in the hands of the students, Elser said. "We're expecting all the students who 
use it lo lake care of it," Elser said. 

Elser has also worked to get suggestion boxes put in campus buildings for 
students' use. "The purpose of the suggestion tioxes is to give students a door lo 
talk to Students' Government." Elser said. He said the plan calls for a screening 
committee to review the suggestions or complaints and (hen pass oo appropriate 
ones Xa Wallace. "(Chancellor Wallacei could then address anything he could 
possibly lake care of," Elser said. 

In order to make Ihe best use of the suggestion boxes, Elser said studenU need to 
include their name, address and phone numtter so Students" Government members 
can validate the complaints received 

The suggestion boxes are located In the basement of Kettler Hall above llie 
Communicator newstand; in the snack lounge of the Class room -Medical building; 
the second floorsnack lounge of NelfHaU; at theexit of the HelmkeLibrary, in the 
Ont door TV lounge of the Walb Union Building and in the Multipurpose Building.

Thimday. April 30, 1987 



After faur years, 
saying goodbye not easy 



How do you say goodbye lo something 
that has become such an integral part of 
your life? Something in which you have 
invested four years of work; something 
around which you have juggled your 
academic schedule, social life, and 
outside work schedule? 

Nevertheless, many of us graduating 
seniors will have lo do just that in the 
coming weeks. For many of us who have 
become very involved in campus ac- 
tivities — whether it has been Ihrougii 
Students' Government, the biology club. 
a sorority or a fraternity, or this 
newspaper — saying goodbye and letting 
go is not easy. 

Off the top of my head, I can think of 
one good tlOng about leaving the com- 
fortable confines of IPFW; I will have 
my degree in hand and will be able lo put 
my talents lo work elsewhere. But tliere 
are a lot of sad things about leaving 
IPFW. the kind of things that make good 
memories. 

When a student becomes active in 
extra-curricular activities at IPFW, he 
or she would undoubtedly have the op- 
porlunily to work with possibly the most 
dedicated office of student services in 
the Indiana or Purdue system: John 
Ulmer, dean of student services; and 
Mary Brant, director of student ac- 
aclivities, are two outstanding in- 
dividuals who always seem to have time 
for students- They know many students 
by name, but more importantly, take the 
time lo get to know the students. That is 
something that more administrators at 
IPFW ought to do. 

Another benefit of being involved at 
IPFW is that you gel to know people 
beyond the classroom. You plan events, 
parties, seminars, or club meetings with 
these people week after week. This 
allows you the chance lo become friends 
with people outside of an academic 
setting — in a setting thai has nothing to 



do with any of your classes. That is very 
important at IPFW, where it is easy for 
a student to drive back and forUi to 
classes every day without ever meeting 
anyone in a social selling. 

Being involved in activities at IPFW 
lets students gel lo know people who run 
this campus. These individuals, from 
Chancellor Thomas Wallace to the 
chairperson of your department or your 
own professors become more than 
names. They become "real people" if 
you will, people who really care about 
higher education, IPFW in particular. 

Being involved in activities lets you 
help mold a certain part of IPFW — the 
part that really makes IPFW a 
university What would IPFW be without 
leaders in Students' Government who 
care about what happens at this 
university? What would IPFW be like 
wilhoul the biology club sponsoring 
guesi speakers every week? What would 
IPFW be like without a Forensics 
League that has won national awards? 
What would IPFW be like without its 
own award-winning newspaper? It 
simply would lose part of its quality. 

It is student involvement Ihafmakes a 
university's programs work. It is in- 
volvement in IPFW that makes the 
years here worth every dime spent and 
every sleepless night studying for finals 
and writing papers worthwhile. 

Vour mvolvement at IPFW means a 
sacrifice of other things, but the benefits 
you gain, the experience you get, the 
lessons you learn in leading student 
organizations is all worth the tim '•"■^ 
effort. 

Being involved makes it diffici '" '" 
say goodbye, because all of a sudde '^ y" 
realize that college — IPFW - ^^^ 
become a very special part of your I ''*■ 
Thanks, 

— Michele Sh ^"^'"

Gregory has the spirit 
to succeed as president 



End of s chool sentimeh ts sincerely given 



Despite concerns to the contrary, the 
recent upset victory by Kurt Gregory 
over Elizabeth Sclilueler for Student 
Body President, can and should be the 
first step in establishing new student 
interest and involvement at IPFW. This 
year's election had one of the largest 
voter turnouts with over 700 students 
participating. 

Gregory won by a 10 vole margin over 
Schiueter, and although the margin was 
not wide, he is evidently the choice of the 
student body at IPFW 

Even though Gregory is new to 
Students' Government, and mapy argue 
that he is not qualified to properly 
represent the student body at large, he 
has the determination and enthusiasm lo 
succeed as president . 

Students' Government, Senate and the 
IPFW community can benefit largely 
from this if an effort is made to tap that 
energy rather than stifle it. 

New faces in new positions is what this 
campus needs The result of this year's 
election shows that the student body is 



anxious for change. The combiif^^ ^^' 
perience of the other Students' {govern- 
ment officers and Senate mr""*^^^ 
coupled with fresh input frc"" ^^ 
president's seat could work ve'"^ "'^^ 
together. For this to happen, hP^v^^^*"- 
those nol having voted for Greg(&gt;''y "^^d 
to realize that the election prt&gt;cess is 
over, and a winner has been nair'.®*^' ^"^ 
it is lime to get down to new bu?'"^ss — 
in a unified, supportive manner. 

There has been so much con^o^ersy 
in the past involving Students' Govern- 
ment that members need '** &lt;^on-

reputation of the organization, sv^'^^nts'

Can you believe it? It's 
thai lime again --already. It 
seems like just three parking 
tickets ago that I was 
eagerly going from class to 
class for the first lime lo see 
what kind of subjects there 
were to study Some, who 
were more subject to being 
studied than others, rarely 
passed by wilhoul a look. 
Some got tired of my staring.

■IT WAS BUCKET I ' 
I trust tbey find you in 

good class standing, both 
academically and with 
respect to classallendance. I 
hope you don't have many of 
those purite-profs who drop 
your grade a letter if you 
miss two or more limes. 1 
say that if a student can do 
well not attending class, 
that's tiis prerogative. But 
still those teachers exist who 
must provide Ihe added 
incentive by threatening 
Uiem- with lowering their, 
grade. There's a direct 
correlation between a 
teacher's abihiy to bore and 
their class-absence policy. I 
feel like I'm in grade school 
and being graded on my 
conduct. 

You look tired! You look 
like you haven't been 



sleeping well lately. What's 
the matter — getting a little 
academic-insomnia, and NO 
that's not when you fall 
asleep in class — that's when 
you can't fall asleep t&gt;ecause 
you haven't been IN class, 
though you may have been 
there. Thai's not lo say you 
don't have any class because 
you didn't go lo class, or 
because you weren't logged 
on while you were there as 
some teachers aforemen- 
tioned advocate. 

Anyway, the bottom line 
i&amp;, if you need an 87 on the 
final to get a "B" Tn the 
class, you'd better get 
cranking. So then maybe you 
too can say, when mid- 
summer you open an en-

Institution, concerning the

answer is a pre-graduation

ments and faculty members. 



Professors honored for efforts

Students recognizes and 
honors those outstanding 
professors who have 
dedicated their time and 
support to those students 
with disabilities. 

This year, two professors, 
Noel Dusendschon, professor 
of fine arts, and Frederick 



Crowley, assistant professor 

of business and economics, 
are being honored for their 
efforts beyond the call of 
duty. The two will have their 
names engraved on the 
existing faculty plaque 
located in the teacher's 
lounge in KetUer Hall. Both 
will receive certificates as 
well. Dusendschon is beine 



Tour to retire 

Working with the students 
of IPFW in the activities 
areas, like Students' 
Government, has been the 
favorite part of Lea Tour's 
employment at IPFW in the 
past 20 year^. 

Tour was honored recently 
for her service and 
dedication to IPFW. Tour 
recently announced her 
intention to retire, but she 
said she has plans to con- 
tinue working at IPFW m the 
Student Services area 
temporarily on a part-time 
basis. 

Tour began working at 
IPFW in 1966 in the 
registrar's office. She said 
she was in that position for 
about ten years, and then 
moved to Student Services 
and worked as a secretary 
for the past ten years In that 
lime, she has had a view that 
very few people have had of 
IPFW: she has had the 
opportunity to watch the 
university grow from one 
building, very few academic 
programs and few students, 
to a full-fledged campus. 

She said thai over the 
years, probably the biggest 




honored for his efforts in 
helping a blind student at 
IPFW continue her studies in 
fine arts Crowley is being 
recognized tor the personal 
lime he has spent working 
v/ith a business student who 
is a quadriplegic and is 
homebound. 

Other professors bemg 
honored with certificates 
this year are Rudy Svoboda. 
associate professor of 
mathematics. Donna Bialik, 
assistant professor of 
business and economics; 
Debra Hall, visiting in- 
structor in mathematics: 
Ruth Hamilton, associate 
faculty in mathematics; 
Roberl Pruse, associate 
faculty in manufacturing 
technology ; Sandra 
Manheimer. assistant 
professor of com- 

munications, Matthew 
Kubic, assistant professor of 



civil and architectural 
engineering; Steven 

Hollander, assistant 
professor of English and 
linguistics; Avon Crismore, 
assistant professor of 
English and linguistics; 
Hector Garcia, associate 
professor of fine arts; Les 
Motz. associate professor of 
fine arts. 

The Office of Disabled 
Student Services will also 
acknowledge some members 
of Ihe IPF'W administration 
who have helped over the 
past year. Those being 
recognized in this area are 
Philhp Kennell, director of 
international services; Jean 
Ross, lab coordinator in the 
department of nursing, and 
John Fitzgerald of the 
Learning Resource Center. 
Editcs-'s note: this .article 
was contributed by Disabled 
Student Services. 



Lea Tour 
improvement she has seen in 
IPFW is the computerized 
registration. "We used to do 
all the registration by hand," 
Tour said. Probably the 
biggest thing that stands out 
about Tour, said Brant, is 
Tour's years of experience 
and her old-fashioned con- 
cept of work. "She's a very 
dedicated person with a real 
sense of responsibiUty for 
her job," Brant said. Brant 
ateo said that Tour has a 
great loyalty to the depart- 
ment of student services and 
to the university. "She will 
\k very difficult to replace," 
Brant said.

from chronic depression 
which is more severe in

One thing separating 
ordinary, everyday 
depression from clinical 
depression is the length of 
the depression itself. It is 
normal to be depressed (or a 
few days at a time. If. 
however, one is chronically 



depressed for months, this 
indicates a more serious 
problem and should be

What is a depressed 
person? How can one tell if 
one is chronically 

depressed? 

According to Aaron Beck, 
a noted psychologist, there 
are a few simple indicators 
of possible, severe 



de press ic 

First, a peraon might think 
of committing suicide. A 
change in crying patterns 
may also signify a problem. 
Crying more than usual or 
not at alt is a significant 
change. 

Another sign of depression 
may betwing overcritical of 
self. Blaming oneself for 
everything that happens is 
typical of depression. 

Feeling like a failure Is 
another sign of depression A

Besides depression,

Volleyball team wraps up *very special season' 



By JENNY BLAKLEV 

SUH Writer 

This season was a very 

special and unique one (or 

(he IPFW men's volleyball 



team. ■'There were a lot of 
firsts this year, " said fresh- 
man player Tim Heffron. 

■'We had never beaten 
Ohio Slate more than once in 



until Ihis year. 
Also, we had never won our 
own toumamenl (the Fort 
Wayne National Bank 
Classic) before this year.

Local students active on scarcely 
known Fort Wayne Rugby club 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 
Stalf Writer 

Many people have the 
misconception thai rugby is 
a more "violent." yet very 
similar, version of football. 
Actually, there are many 
differences between this 
hard-hilling game and (he 
■'pigskin " sport. 



esh r 



T i m 



Nicodemus. a member of the 
Fort Wayne Rugby Club, 
cites an important difference 
between the two sports. 
"Football is a collision sporl, 
while rugby is a contact 
sport." The contact can be 
rough al times, however, 
because rugby playere are 
not protected by any pad- 
ding. The players have 
sustained a variely of in- 
juries, some minor, and 
others more serious. Many 
fall into the category of 
■■deep bruises," while others 
consist of such things as 
separated shoulders. 

However, severe injuries 
are fairly uncommon. 
"There are rules limiting 
dangerous play," said 
sophomore Dave Oster- 
meyer, also a Fort Wayne 
Rugby Club member. 

A major distinction bet- 
ween football and rugby is 
the method in which the ball 



, handled. "&lt;In rugby), you 
kick the ball forward instead 
of throw it," Nicodemus 
said. Also in rugby, a 
"fumble " is a necessary part 
o( the game "When you get 
tackled, you must gel rid ot 
the baU," Ostermeyer said. 
'■There is constant 
movemenl; you never slop to 
get plays together," 



1 our subunion, like 
Lima and Findlay (Ohio)," 
Ostermeyer said. 

The learn plays a spring 
and a fall season, each 
consisting of len games, 
played al Franke Park. They 
also hold the Three Rivers 
Festival Rugby Tour- 
nament.

team member 



The "Black and Blue," 
Fort Wayne's rugby club, is 
competitive with other 
teams in the midwest, in- 
cluding South Bend, Gary, 
Indianapolis and Louisville. 
as wellas Ball State, Indiana 
and Purdue Universilies. 
Fort Wayne is in the Indiana 
and Kentucky "subunion," 
which is a part of the mid- 
wesl "Union," and includes 
a total of 13 "subunions." 
"We play a lot of teams (hat 



According (o Nicodemus, 
the "membership" is run 
similar to "wildcat 

baseball, " where anyone 
who wishes may play. 
Ostermeyer said, "We 
always need new members." 
The team recruits members 
by advertising on (he radio, 
as well as placing posters in 
various locations 

Ostermeyer said he never 
had any previous com- 
petibve athletic experience 



before joining Ihe rugby 
club. "1 never played sports 
in high school. Jeff Newport 
(another rugby club 
member) was in one ot my 
classes and told me about it, 
and I love ill It makes up for 
whal I lost out in high 
school," Ostermeyer said. 

Nicodemus has been a 
member since 1973, and also 
joined after being asked by a 
friend. "1 played football in 
high school," Nicodemus 
said. 

Since the team members 
have had no previous rugby 
experience, how do they 
learn lo "master" Ihe sport? 
According lo Ostermeyer. 
"We practice every Tuesday 
and Thursday (and have 
games on Saturdays). Ex- 
perience Is the best 

The Fort Wayne Club has 
been in existence since 1969 
and was started by Todd 
Davis, who also founded 
O'Sullivan's Pub. 

The next home contest for 
the ''Black and Blue" is May 
9 against Toledo. Game lime 
is set for 2 p.m. at Franke 
Park. The next Saturday

Volleyball Association 
(MIVA) tournament 

Head Coach Arnie Ball 
echoed these ac- 

eomplishmcnls as the 
highlights of the season. The 
"standoul points ' Ball said 
were "winning the Fort

players on the all-confcrence 
team (Golsleyn and senior 
Ted Owen) , which was a first 

Although the Mastodons 
lost a match to Ohio State 
last Friday in the MIVA 
conference tournament, the 
numerous accomplishments 
the team has achieved 
should lead them to a great 
outlook for next season. 

"The outlook is good for 
next year," Ball said, 
"especially with the number 
of players that will be back 
next year lall will be back 
except for Owen), and their 
additional year of ex- 
perience." 

The Mastodons look for- 
ward lo positive future 
seasons, because of the 
youth of the team. Ball said. 
"We will be relatively young, 
with several juniors and 
sophomores and new 
recruits. We will only have 
one senior, Phil Bodine."

I MADE $18,000 
COLLEGE 
WORKING WEEKENDS. 



99 




When my friends and I graduated 
from high school, we all took part-time 
jobs to pay for college. 

They ended up in car washes and 
hamburger joints, putting in long hours 
for little pay. 

Not me. My job takes just one 
weekend a month and two weeks a year 
Yet, I'm earning $18,000 for college. 

Because I joined my local Amiy 
National Guard. 

They're the people who help our 
state during emergencies like hurri- 
canes and floods. They're also an 
important part of our country's military 
defense. 

So, since I'm helping them do such 
an important job, they're helping me 
make it through school. 



As soon as I finished Advanced 
Training, the Guard gave me a cash 
bonus of $2,000. Then, under the New 
GI Bill, I'm getting another $5,000 for 
tuition and books. 

Not to mention my monthly Army 
Guard paychecks. They'll add up to 
more than $11,000 over the six years 
I'm in the Guard. 

And if I take out a college loan, the 
Guard will help me pay it back-up to 
$1,500 a year, plus interest. 

It all adds up to $18,000-or more 
-for college for just a little of my time. 
And that's a heck of a better deal than 
any car wash will give you. 
THE GUARD CAN HELP PUT 
YOU THROUGH COLLEGE, TOO.
