Brock Able, president of the 
student body at Indiana-Purdue, 
( issued a statement Wednesday even- 
ing, October 24, calling for a "super- 
administrator" to govern the Fort 
Wayne campus in the future. 

Abie's position, which is expected 
to exert strong influence on the 
Commission of Higher Education and 
the state legislature, was arrived at 
following the release of the so-called 
Keenan Report, submitted to the 
Commission this month. Able stated 
he does not favor administration of 
Indiana-Purdue to fall under the 
control of either university, but rather 
a director who reports to the 
presidents of both schools. Able said, 
'I would like to see a super-adminis- 
trator, responsible to the presidents of 
both universities, but one who has no 
affiliation to either school." 

Able also called for the students 
at the Fort Wayne Campus to have a 
voice in selecting the new "super- 
administrator." Said Able, "I'm 
requesting at this point, that any 
select committee chosen for selecting 
names of this administrator be made 
up of one-third Indiana faculty, 



Able expressed the following view 
of the impact his plan would have on 
the present system, "Since my 
proposed plan is to combine the 
administration, I believe that the 
faculty should also b e combined into 
an Indiana-Purdue faculty, thus doing 
away with duplicative departments, 
and increasing possibilities of new 
curriculum at Fort Wayne; for 
example, Purdue, forestry, engineer- 
ing technology and computer scien- 
ces, and expansion of Indiana's 
geology and sociology departments, 
to name a few. This plan would 
eliminate duplication, such as the 
present English departments, and 



definitely provide for expansion in 

Able was asked his opinion of 

funding of the Fort Wayne Campus. 
He said, " It is my belief that we ought 
to be budgeted by the state legislature 

• sity." 



. David Gatchell said, 
"I think that both students and faculty 
alike will wholeheartedly support 
Abie's suggestions, and will make this

efficiency of the administration of this 
campus."

Bulletin 

U. S. forces here and abroad were 
placed on alert late last evening, in 
response to a warning by Russia that 
they may send troops to the Middle 
East. The Russians already are 
reported by NBC News to have some 
troops in the area and approximately 
80 ships stationed in the Mediter- 

The U.S. bases on preliminary 
alert were the SAC headquarters in 
Colorado and the nnctear bases in 
Montana. 

The Russian warning came when 
it was learnedthat the Egyptian Third 
Army was surrounded and in danger 
of annihilation by Israeli forces near 
Suez City. The Egyptia

Senator Charles Pratt added, 
"The unification of this campus' 
administration will hopefully provide 
our college with a more efficient 
means of governing. 1 would hope this 
unification will increase our ability to 
better student welfare." 

Abie's plan also calls for the 
of the present university 



the direct control of neither i

Reaction to the Able plan could be 
expected later in the week. These par-

Purdue have offered n

Purdue-Indiana Theatre's first 
major production of the season, 
Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage, will 
open here Friday night. The play, 
which will also be PIT's entry in the 
National College Theatre Festival, is 
the story of a mother and her children 
through twelve years of the holy war 
in Europe in the early seventeenth 
century. 

Mother Courage will be played by 
Patricia Victor from Van Wert, Ohio. 
Mrs. Victor has played numerous 
roles in Ohio and the Fort Wayne area 
and is presently a student at 
Indiana-Purdue. 

Mother Courage's first son, 
played by Jan Swank, is a dolt, but 
makes a dashing soldier and plunder- 
er. Her second son, Swiss Cheese, is 
honest and meets an early death from 
a firing squad. This role will be 
.portrayed by Doug Updycke. Her 
'mute daughter, Kattrin, will be 
performed by Denise Moore. 

j Briefly, the plot consists of 
Mother Courage and her mute 
daughter following the armies with 
their wagon and wares, as first one 
side then another side wins. They 
acquire in their train a chaplain, 
played by Larry Life; a cook, 
portrayed by R. Lee Stangland; and a 
camp follower, performed by Nancy 
Faulkner. One day peace is declared. 
But it is too brief. The plundering 
soldier son is brought to shame and 
the daughter who would be married is 
shot instead. War is resumed; for it 
seems that war, like love, is 
perpetual. 

Others in the large cast are 
Robert Bartel, Dave Wiikening, Jim 
Welch, Chuck Davis, Neal Bearman, 
Cindy Smythe, Robert McKee, Gerry 
Snyder, Dan Kelley. David Thomp- 
son, and Lee Wells. 

Dr. Daniel Cashman will direct 
|the production. He also has composed 
original music for the songs in the 
production. Scoring was done with the 
assistance of Robert Ferguson, Lee 
Well.s and Paul Hamman. The 
Musicians for Mother Courage are 
Lee Wells, piano and harpsichord; 
Janet Baker, accordion and harpsi- 
chord; Robert McKee, drums; Chuck 
Davis, flute and drums; and Jim 
Welch, trumpet and baritone.

Bolinger tells of 
new eligibility 
requirements 



BY TOMMY FRANKE 

The Joint Athletic Committee will 
meet Tuesday with the members of 
the soccer team and their coach to 
consider what types of awards should 
be given to the team. 

The team was forced to forfeit all 
of the games played in the 1973-74 
soccer season because three mem- 
bers did not meet eligibility require- 
ments newly-enforced this school 

According to Jim Bolinger, athle- 
tic director, these requirements are 
being enforced in order to make 
Indiana-Purdue meet the same types 
of requirements its competitors must 



n credit loads and academic 
standings for all members participat- 
ing 'in varsity sports, are the same 
requirements specif ied by the Nation- 
al Collegiate Athletic Association and 
the National Association of Intercol- 
legiate Athletics. Most schools that 
the soccer team competes with, other 
than the regional campuses, adhere to 
these or similar requirements. 

Said Bolinger, "We have been 
indirectly pressured to adhere to 
these requirements. When we first 
started our athletic programs, we 
were still fairly weak and the other 
schools were not too worried about us. 
Now that we are really able to 
compete they are beginning to care if 
we have graduate students or 



The committee (JAC) decided to 
institute these regulations in order to 
improve the quality of our teams. 

"Sooner or later we would like to 
join either the NCAA or the NAIA. We 
are trying to become ,i part of the 
Indiana Intercollegiate Athletic Asso- 
ciation as a stepping stone to joining 
the national organizations." 

Bolinger admitted that it was his 
fault that this shake-up occurred at 
this time. "I am supposed to receive 
a roster of all individuals on the teams 
at least two weeks prior to the start of 
the season. I then forward this 
information to David Shelton (direct- 
or of records and admissions). He 
then checks to see if the players meet 
the requirements of credit hours 
completed and academic standings. 

"I kept trying to get the roster 
from the soccer coach but didn't 
receive a complete one until recently. 
It is, however, my responsibility, so I 
take full responsibility for the

Speaking 



Coup d'etat didn't 
surprise Allende 



More on the Keenan Report 

Two weeks ago this newspaper gave its qualified support to the 
Keenan Report and its recommendation that Indiana-Purdue be made 
independent from both parent universities. Our qualification was that we 
were unsure of this as a real alternative, given the political facts of life of 
this state. 

Since that editorial appeared, a number of people have indicated to 
us their suppiirl lor independence On Hit' oilier IkhkI, a number ol people 
have strongly condemned the concept of independence for IU-PU. Still 
others are worried about the ramifications of independence, and are 
confused as to which way this campus should go. 

Last week we interviewed Dr. David Onwood, Purdue chapter 
president of the American Association of University Professors, on the 
subject of independence for IU-PU. His opinions are those held by a large 
number of faculty on this campus. 

We have decided to use the Onwood interview as the first in a series 
on the question of independence. We hope lo talk lo as many different 
people with different outlooks on the subject as time and space will allow. 

The intent of the interviews is to inform our readership of all the 
angles from which this matter can be approached. The series will show 
how independence can be good for IU-PU and how it can hurt us as an 
educational institution. 

We also want to encourage anyone who has an opinion to tell us, 
either through a guest opinion column or a letter to the editor. We 
especially want to urge students to write in concerning their feelings. II is 
our hope that the opinion pages of this newspaper will represent a 
cross-section of the attitudes existing on this campus. 

This is the single most important issue Facing IU-PU, our collective 
future is at stake. It is crucial that those who will ultimately seal our fate 
be made aware of our opinions. 

Energy must be conserved 



In a world full of paradoxes it is appropriate that the laughable comic 
strip beagle Snoopy should become the federal symbol to bring home to 
Americans one of the most serious problems of our times. Snoopy, 
according to John A. Love, the administration's energy adviser, will be 
wisely used to remind Americans of the need to conserve energy. 

Snoopy conserves his energy by lying flat on his back on his 
doghouse. The energy that Mr. Love is talking about right now is propane 
and oil to heat homes, jet fuel and similar distillates. His plea is simple. 
Turn down your thermostats a few degrees, close off your empty rooms, 
drive your car more slowly and use other conservation practices and you 
will save fuel and money, he says. 

Mr. Love makes a lot of sense. The United States of America is 
awakening to the need for a crash effort to once again become 
self-sufficient in energy. Just last week the Administration announced a 
new allocation of $115 million for energy research and development, 
bringing the total lo §1 billion. Additionally, a panel of 15 scientists now 
will advise the President on how best to close the time gap between 
research and development. 

However, all of this takes time-at leasl four or five years. In the 
meantime, the warning of Mr. Love is timely. "Demand (for home 
heating oil and gas) will be made to fit supply," said Mr. Love. "There 
will be some government intrusion" to allocates fuel on a priority basis. 

Some intrusion already has been felt. On Oct. 2 the Administration 
announced its plan to ration propane gas and home heating oil becaus 
some areas will be in short supply!. Details of the program were fleshed 
out by Mr. Love, and they leave no doubt that the federal government 
intends to take charge. It will include a bureaucracy to issue regulations 
and to enforce them. 

Government invasion of our living rooms is indeed a melancholy 
situation for the United States which has an abundance of energy in 
undeveloped coal, gas and oil fields. Few realize that we have, for 
example, enough coal to last us for six hundred years at the present rate 
of production. 

No purpose could be served by reciting the litany of government 
misjudgments over the years that have led us to our present energy 
predicament. Suffice it to note that the tide appears to have turned and 
political pressures on Washington now are at work to acceleratge energy 
development. A cold winter undoubtedly would increase these pressures. 

It is a critical time for Americans. Unless they pay close attention to 
their thermostats and take a more conservative view of speed on the 
freeway, the need for controls will increase and the government which 
brought us Snoopy en the doghouse will put us all into it. 



The coup that ended President 
Salvador Allende's effort to impose 
socialism on Chile, and his life, came 
as no great surprise to him. 



Talk was rife of military mkT 
vention in government, what with the 
escalating political, social and eco- 
nomic disorder in the country. 

In August, the Chamber of 
Deputies lengthily debated a resolu- 
tion calling on Allende to stop 
infringing on the constitution and the 

The final version, passed by an 
lo-47 vote, went on lo suggest that 
navy, air force and 



the 

carabineer (national policeJ chiefs i 
Allende's cabinat would be negligent 
in Iheir duty to the Chilean nation if 
they did not make sure the Marxist 
eovernmenl mended its ways. 

Allende termed the resolution a 
brazen attempt "to promote a coup 
d'etat." which it was. 

Yet the resolution passed, with 
the affirmative votes of a total of 81 
Christian Democrats and National 
Party deputies, against the nays of 47 
Marxists. 

It was not a sneak attack that the 
armed forces pulled on the Marxist 
president He was waiting for it. He 
knew it was coming. 

He was there in his offices in La 
Moneda palace in the heart of 
Santiago at an unusually early hour 
when the armed forces demanded he 
resign. 

Allende chose to resist, perhaps in 
the hope that the paramilitary 
workers, students and slum-dwellers' 
brigades that the Socialists and the 
ultra-leftists had organized, would 

That last seems quite unlikely, to 
anyone who knows the map of 
Santiago. La Moneda, a squat, 
colonial-style structure, with a block- 
square plaza in front and two block- 
square plazas in back, surrounded by 
generally taller buildings, just is not a 
rnililarv defensible position. 

The shooting and aerial bombing 
were over at La Moneda in a 
relatively short time. The army 
patrol that first entered the building 
reportedly found the president dead.r 
with a self-inflicted bullet wound in 
the head, according to the autopsy. 

One of the first official foreign 
policy actions of the military junta 
that took over the government was to 
break diplomatic relations with 
Communist Cuba. 

Cuban Ambassador Mario Carcia 
lnchaustegui and his 170-man staff, 
including Luis Fernandez Ona, who is 
married to one of Allende's daught- 
ers, left Chile within hours aboard a 
Soviet jet airliner. 

The fact that the military junta 
moved so quickly to rid Chile of the 
Cuban Communists was believed an 
indication of the depth of their 
resentment of Cuban meddling there. 

The Chilean armed forces, like 
many civilian Chilean anti-Commun- 
ists, have long been troubled by the 
Marxist policies and programs of the 
Allende regime. 

But, a year ago. the story in 
Santiago was that the Chilean armed 
forces were determined not to repeat 
the mistake that their Argentine 
counterparts made in 1955 when they 
deposed dictator Juan Domingo 



Spirit lifter 
of the week 



to feel, a dictator or objectionable 
head of state should be allowed to 
remain in power long enough for the 
errors of his ways lo become obvious 
to most, if not all, of the people. Then, 
when of necessity he must be 
removed from power, his partisans 
will not be able to make him out to be 
a martyr, a man who would have 
saved his country, had his efforts not 
been cut short by the armed forces. 

As the story in the Chilean capital 
was told, a high-ranking officer had 
said that the armed forces would not 
move against Allende, despite the 
excesses of his government "until the 
people knelt in the streets in front of 
the barracks and begged for the 
military to take over." 

The situation did not quite get to 
that point in Allende's 



himself said 
revolt and popular demonstrations 
against the government were increas- 
ing. 

That the Marxists, in Latin 
America and the world over, are 
taking Allende's ouster as a personal 



generally considered Marxist, like 
West Germany's Willy Brandt and 
Mexico's President Luis Echeverria, 
have spoken out in anguish. 




It's the Art Hansen Show 




Soccer player upset over forfeit decision 



freshman member of the IU-PU 
soccer team. I'm not one of the six 

eligible members of the team, but 




October 16 (which I didn't attend 
because I didn't know about it) it was 
declared that six of the fifteen players 
had been declared ineligible. As a 
result, every match this year will end 
in a forfeit. Couldn't this have been 
avoided by "investigating" the play- 
ers' eligibility before the season 
started? These guys out here have 
been giving their all for about two 
month's only to find out it didn't 

Many of these players had to go 
the full 90 minutes of a game without a 
rest (excluding five minutes for half) 
giving up their time and bodies just 
for the pride of the college they 



handful of fans, but the Mastodons 
kept trying. Many of these players 
sustained injuries which would have 
sidelined lesser men. Why? For 
fame? Fortune? For the fans? The 
answer is simple: Dedication to a 
sport and a school. 



The second point concerns itself 
with the proposed consideration of 
omitting soccer as an inter -collegiate 
sport at IU-PU. The alternative 
would be to make it an intramural 
sport. Sure it would save money 
($5,000) and the school would be 
getting rid of a "losing squad" (2-5-2 
Just 



That money can now go into 
setting up an inter-collegiate ping- 
pong team or maybe a TV for the 
meeting room. 
Don't talk about the lack of fan 
support because every IU-PU sport 



&gt;ut. The reason is the lack of 
advertising. It's too late for soccer, 
but putting up posters telling about 
upcoming games (which takes about 
five minutes) might have brought out 
the fan support. Was this the players' 
responsibility? No! But whose? 

The team at the start got 15 guys 
who wanted to play soccer and U are 
allowed to play at one time. If this is 
how many wanted to play, than how 



they are considered ineligible. Super 
timing. 

But don't worry, they'll probably 
get a pat on the back or a certificate 
saying, "You played soccer until we 
found you were ineligible." I really 
hope this doesn't happen in the school 
I chose to attend. To lose respect for 
your own school really is a bad thing. 



A Is. 



little 



personal, what happens to the first 
year soccer player whose goal was to 
attain the highest form of accomplish- 
ment—the letter jacket— if the sport 
goes intramural? 

The rules say that to get a jacket 
you must compete in a varsity sport 
for two years. Speaking for myself, 
but keeping in mind what some of the 
others feel, when I started thinking 
about awards, I really didn't gloat 
over the fact that I would receive a 
letter sweater, but looked forward to 
next year when I would finally get my 
jacket. 

Now if the sport turns intramural, 
my goal will be just a sad dream since 
I know that I couldn't compete in any 
of the other varsity sports to get that 
second year of playing. 

Letter sweaters are fine for 
indoor use, but I want to show the city 
that I played soccer for IU-PU. Don't 
take this chance away from me. Even 
though we had to forfeit all our games 



guy and so what these ineligible 
players get should be good enough for 
the rest of us. 

V1NCELOCHBIHLER 



Manges disputed 

To the Editor: 

I was concerned with the article 
on parking fees and, in particular. 
Dean Manges' comments. The 
faculty, staff, and students who 
served on that committee have been 
repeatedly blamed for recommending 
paid parking. Dean Manges indicated 
that the "committee's final recom- 
mentions led to the present pro- 
gram." This is false. Page 7 of the 



littee s

- and I'd do it all i 



had to forfeit because of lack of 
players! 1 .! 

My third point considers awards. 
I read the committee feels that since 
the players have been declared 
ineligible, they shouldn't receive the 
varsity award but a sort of recogni- 
tion. These guys wanted to play the 
game, but, as in everything, they 
decent type of recognition 
to show what they've accomplished. 
The players declared ineligible have 
worked two months striving for this 
award only to have their hopes shot 
down by some top brass telling them 



I heard that in that meeting ( Oct. 
16) it was brought up that the 
committee thought that some of the 
players didn't care about the game. 
Some of these guys have been out to 
every practice (even in rain and cold) 
and every game. That's dedication. 

Someof the players also twisted 
their ankles or screwed-up their knees 
and continued playing, and you say 
they don't care? How many members 
of the committee have taken time out 
from their golf game or poker games 
to support the team? 

The dedication to the game was 
shown when the players voted to 
continue the "lost season" as if 
nothing happened. Even though the 
final three games end in forfeit, I 
know that I (and the other players) 
will be giving all to win. 

In closing, I would like to say that 
whatever happens, I was proud to be a 
member of the Indiana-Purdue soccer 
team and I will always be proud to tell 
people. It was a real pleasure playing 
alongside some of the most dedicated 
people in any sport. I must admit that 
it will sadden me if soccer is dropped 
from the inter-collegiate level be- 
cause then my goal has been in vain. 
If 1 had $5,000 I would gladly give it to 
you for the continuation of the sport. 
It would give some of the guys a 
chance to earn that jacket and to get 
the respect back for a truly great 
school. 

Final note: If any of the players 
is deprived of the varsity award 
which he deserves, you can save some 
money and keep my sweater, because 
we worked and played as a team. 1

follows: "Since the use of a car is a 
necessity for the great majority, and 
recognizing that public transportation 
is adequate for only a few of the 
students and staff, the principle of 
paying for the necessity of parking is 
objectionable. Even though self- 
supporting parking (Alternative 6) 
can be seen as a viable alternative for 
providing spaces over the next ten 
years, there appear to be other 
desirable short-term alternatives. 
We present the following alternatives 
and recommend the adoption of one of 
these as opposed to the self-support- 
ing parking alternative on a short- ' 

Unfortunately. Chancellor Broy- 
les and Acting Dean Larry 0. Nelson 
either refused or neglected to read the 
recommendations and instead pro- 
posed to the Indiana and Purdue 
presidents that the trustees institute

i had rejected.

.^yndrome. 

X Government agencies like the 
Federal Trade Commission, the 
Federal Communications Commis- 
sion and the Food and Drug 
Administration constantly try to 
control the drug industry. The 
manage to call in dangerous products 
'.■at times. They try to hold advertising 
and promotion claims down to a 
'college yell but seldom seem to 
* succeed. 

In the field of pricing medicine 
cabinet drugs, the government seems 
at a loss to do much about keeping the 
cost spread on the same product from 
often doubling, tripling, or worse, 
depending on the store, the name 
brand and the circumstances. 

Some prominent medical scien- 
tists believe the three-cornered ven- 
detta will be settled only when 
overpriced, ineffective drugs are 
poured down the drain instead of 
down people's throats. 

Unfortunately, they don't hold out 
much hope that this will happen soon. 

"That's the only way we're ever 
going to solve the medicine cabinet 
drug problem , ' ' says Dr . George 
Lundberg, an eminent pathologist and 
professor of pathology at the Univer- 
sity of Southern California's School of 
Medicine, Los Angeles. 

"We believe it is our right to use 
drugs to make life a little easier - as- 
pirin, Excedrin, Alka Seltzer, Rol- 
aids, Compoz, NoDoz, cold pills and 
all sorts of ' 'magic" chemicals to ease 
our minor aches and pains," he points 

"Habit is a normal part of our 
life, whether it's dependency on 
booze, aspirin or heroin. These are 
still forms of habit and we are a drug- 
oriented nation." 

■ Dr. Lundberg concedes that 
doctors aren't always a help, especi- 
ally when they're too quick to 
prescribe drugs. 

"Like everyone else, they seem to 
be practicing with the idea of keeping 
people off their backs instead of 
trying to cure their problems," he 
asserts. "It seems as though the 
great American solution to the drug 
problem is to substitute more drugs. 

"We replace alcohol with tran- 
quilizers, heroin with methadone. 

"Why not replace drugs with no 

"Everyone gets anxious, depress- 
ed excited or suffers minor pain or 
cant't sleep. So what? We must learn 
to cope with these minor problems. 

' it's time doctors stopped relying 
on psycho-active drugs to soothe 
people. Sooner or later doctors must 
ask themselves: 'Why should I 
prescribe any drug at all?' " 

Dr. Lundberg, however, sees no 
complete solution to the drug pro- 

"The solution will come only 
when we have broken the vicious 
cycle of drugs-to-replace-drugs and 
drugs to alter emotions, instead of 
really trying to treat patients. 

"When we finally produce a 
generation of people who can cope 
with reality, then we will begin to 
control this mess that has turned us 
into a nation of pill-poppers, booze 
drinkers and junkies or one kind or

Along another vein, Harvard 
nutritionist Dr Jean Mayer describes 
nonprescription diet drugs as a 
"rhythm method of girth control" 
aimed at overweight Americans 
concerned about their sex appeal. 

He is especially critical of 
manufacturers of over-the-counter 
diet pills - the vast array of drugstore 
items promoted as quick weight loss 
aides, such as candy-flavored appe- 
tite reducers and fad diets stressing 
consumption of grapefruit and hard- 
boiled eggs. 

"The fact is that none of these 
methods works for very long," 
contends the sometime government 
consultant on nutrition matters. 
"They're like the rhythm method of 
girth control... This is a snake oil-type 
of industry of absolutely no value 
whatsoever." 

The only real way to lose weight, 
says Dr. Mayer, is to eat a sensible 
diet and exercise properly.

Sloppy reporting 
threatens press 



By TIM DUCEY 

A good news reporter, whether he 
works for a newspaper, radio or 
television, is constantly in search of 
an exclusive story, or a "scoop." 
Editors and publishers recognize the 
values of such stories, and reward a 
good investigative reporter with 
bonuses and a free rein to seek out 
his or her own way, knowing 




that such exclusives sell papers 
help gain new listeners or ' 
their news programs. 

In the same light, if 
seeks out such stories, he is 
responsible for submitting his sources 

STUDENT GUEST COLUMN 

and complete information on his story 
to his editor, so that the editor is 
satisfied lhat the story is based on 
fact, and not the imagination of the 
reporter. This is done for the 
practical reason that yellow journal- 
ism is widely recognized as distaste- 
ful to most of the general public, and 
actually causes circulation to turn 
downward, if used too often. At least, 
it used to be so, 

Since the Watergate affair and 
the Agnew criminal invest ina! inns, 



the 



of "unidentified 



"allegedly," "reportedly" and other 
such ambiguous terms have increas- 
ed dramatically. A reporter who used 
these phrases in the past would not 
last very long with a reputable news 
organization. But today, it is the rule, 
rather than the exception. 

The use of unidentified or 
unnamed sources in the case of 
Watergate or the Agnew investigation 
—\ bad enough, since, in many of 



the reporter. Too often the persons 
being reported about are innocent of 
any wrong-doing, and are victims of 
the reporters' views of a certain 
story. In such a case, a later 
retraction of a false story does not 
erase the damage done to the 
reputation of an innocent person 
because of the original story. A false 
accusation that damages a person's 
reputation is ugly and unjustifiable. 
A reporter on the national scene, 
and even more on the international 
scene, has a greater responsibility, 
since his story can influence a 
national or international audience. 
His information must be checked, and 
double-checked for accuracy, both by 
himself and again by his editors, 
because of the impact a mistake in 



CALL ME MS. 



Of equal pay for equal work 



By AUDREY GELLIS 

Feminist demands for equal pay 
for equal work have been viewed with 
alarm in some corporate circles 
which fear that its application will 
mean the demise of the family. 

Lawdson Masters, president of 
the NCP Manufacturing Co., was 
outraged recently by a memo from 
his publicity director, Miss Handout, 
a single woman of 35 earning $12,500. 
She had requested a raise to $15,000 
pointing out that her predecessor, a 
man, earned $25,000. 

Flabbergasted, Mr. Masters sum- 
moned his personnel chief . "Does this 
woman realize that the man she 
replaced has a wife and three 
children? Has she no respect for the 
institution of marriage." 

"I'll speak to her about the 
situation," the personnel head replied 
humbly. 

"Thank goodness, Miss Jamison, 
there are still truly feminine women 
like you around. Your 30 years of 
service with MCP will not go 
unnoticed." 

"Thank you, sir," Miss Jamison 
replied, pouring Mr. Master's coffee. 

"I am issuing an employe 
directive," Mr. Masters continued, 
"regarding MCP personnel policy, 
making it clear that while we take 
pride in being an equal opportunity 
employer, MCP also recognizes that 
men are the breadwinners in our 
society. A woman working for 
personal fulfillment simply can't 
expect the same pay as the head of a 
household. 

"Make that about 10 pages, Miss 
Jamison. Just polish up what I said 
and put it in your own words." 

A week later. Miss Jamison's 
neatly typed report was in her boss's 
"in" box. Five minutes later, she was 
in his office. 

"Are you drunk, Miss Jamison? 
What is the meaning of the recom- 
mendation that my salary be cut in 
half. As president of MCP, I earn 



every cent of my $100,000," Masters 

"It's like this, Mr. Masters," Miss 
Jamison crossed her legs and kicked 
off one sensible oxford. "I checked 
with Mrs. Masters and you certainly 
do take good care of her and the 
children. But all those girls she told 
me you take care of aren't part of 
your family, so you don't need all that 

While Masters was struggling for 
breath, Hughbert Hutchener, MCP's 
star salesman barged in. 

"Jamie, old girl, there you are. 
Will you please explain to the cashier 
that the cut in my paycheck is a 
mistake?" Hutchener asked. 

"It's no mistake, Hughie, ol boy. 
It's Masters' orders. He wants 
salaries based on family responsibili- 
ties and you're a bachelor," Miss 
Jamison said. 

"But I've got responsibilities. The 
payments on my stereo and my sports 
car.. .my nightclub bills...," Hutchen- 



tions are accepted, we're all going out 
on strike. Of course, if you think MCP 
can manage without its secretaries, 
clerks, bookkeepers, telephone opera- 

"Miss Jamison, be reasonable," 
Masters pleaded. "Look, I'll give you 
a two thou increase. Raise your 
salary to $13,000." 

"That's very good of you, 
Masters, but as vice president in 
charge of personnel, I'll be making 

MONEY MATTERS 



$30,000." 

"Miss Jamison, you're a 51-year- 
oldspinster. What will you do with all 
that money?" 

"It's Ms. Jamison now," the vice 
president said, standing in the 
doorway. "And I'm getting myself a 
plush pad. a yacht and a boy 
friend.. .in that order. 

"See you on the company plane," 
Ms. Jamison slammed the door 
behind her. 



such a story might have on those who 
digest it. It can only be considered 
utter irresponsibility when an inter- 
national story turns out to be untrue, 
and is reported anyway. 

An example of such irresponsibil- 
ity came to light this past week. In 
reporting on the Arab-Israeli conflict, 
CBS reporter Dean Brelis in Damas- 
cus, Syria, reported that the Russian 
Embassy there had been bombed by 
Israel, that he had "seen the rubble," 
and that 30 Russians had been killed, 
including women and children. When 
this story broke, the reaction was 
quick in coming. The Russian 
ambassador to the UN stood up in a 
General Assembly meeting, called 
the Israelis "international crimin- 
als," and stalked out, No doubt, the 
councils of war in Moscow were 
meeting that day to consider revenge 



quite possible that the Soviet Union 
could have declared war on Israel, 
which would have forced the United 
States to go to the defense of Israel, 
and could have led to World War III, 
It can and should be said here, that 
the USSR is to be applauded for 
showmi: restraint in its examination 
of this incident. The consequences of 
the CBS story could have been 
horrible. 

Finally, the truth came out. The 
facts of the bombing are so far 
removed from the story Brelis and 
CBS reported as to be astounding. It 
was discovered that the building 
destroyed was not the Russian 
Embassy, but the Russian Cultural 
Center. There were not 30 Russians 
killed, but six workmen, as yet 
unidentified as to their nationality. No 
women. No children. If Brelis 
actually "saw the rubble," then how 
could he have reported such a 
blatantly false story? He sheepishly 
admitted later (hat "an unidentified 
Soviet diplomat" told him of the 
casualties. Who told his eyes he was 
standing in front of the Russian 
Embassy? Who lold his vision he saw 
the bodies of women and children in 
the destruction? A man who has been 
a reporter for as long as Brelis must 
be aware of the impact such a story 
would have with the Russians. Is that 
impact what Brelis wanted? Did he 
envision the Russians, in a fit of rage, 
attacking the country of Israel in 
retaliation? Did he think of where 
lhat retaliation would lead, as far as 
the United States was concerned? In 
my opinion, he did. I would hesitate to 
say the same about CBS. They can 
re-establish their reputation with me 
by firing Brelis, and not only double- 
checking, but triple-checking any 
future critical news releases of this 

I don't fancy a war with the Soviet 
Union over the misreporttng of a 
newsman or the irresponsibility of a 
news network. This incident might 
promote a close look by the networks 
and other mass media into their 
now-popular practice of the use of 
"unconfirmed reports" and "sources 
close to." Freedom of the press 
carries with it the responsibility to be 
free. Such abuses as the Brelis 
incident could lead to a censorship 
that no one wants in America. The 
press should know that if it doesn't 
police itself, eventually someone else

After a siege of severe inflation, 
the public takes heart when govern- 
ment announces a price freeze. 

The trouble is. however, price 
freezes do not really work. They have 
not proved to be disinflationary, 
either in this country or abroad. 

Less popular and at least equally 
unsuccessful are wage freezes. It 
would seem that close control over 
wages might be maintained quite 
handily for modest periods. 

History documents that it does 
not work that way. 

This should not be surprising in 
democracies, but even authoritarian 
nations have failed in efforts to 
control inflation by means of either 
wage or price controls, or both. 

Twelve European countries in 
recent years have tried wage con- 
trols: Britain, Austria, Denmark, 
France, Finland, Norway, Spain. 
Switzerland, The Netherlands, Ire- 
land, Iceland and Yoguslavia. Three 
tried complete wage freezes. 

The German Tribune, an English- 
language newspaper, records their 
lack of success. 

In Britain, wage guidelines per- 
mitted a 2.5 per cent increase in 1970 
and 4.5 per cent in 1971, but collective 
bargaining alone produced an in- 



crease of approximately 10 per cent. 

Austria was acknowledged to be 
highly experienced in wage pegging 
subtleties. In 1971, that country 
planned for wages to increase no 
more than 8 per cent. They actually 
rose 14 per cent. 

The report from Germany notes 
that pay in Finland was supposed to 
rise an average of 5.5 per cent a year 
in 1968, 1969 and 1970. Statistics show 
that industrial wages alone climbed 
an average of 10.5 per cent in those 

In Ireland, the wage guidelines 
have been exceeded by almost 40 per 
cent since going into effect. 

Norwegians, in 1971, collected a 
wage drift about 50 per cent above 
negotiated wage settlements, al- 
though this was officially forbidden. 

In France from 1968 through 1971, 
wage guidelines were surpassed by 
approximately 50 per cent. 

The German Tribune states that 
"even under the authoritarian Span- 
ish government, the only wage freeze 
that came near to succeeding was in 
1968. In the next two years, the 
officially decreed level of wage rises 
was almost doubled." 

In the most geographically di- 
from Iceland to 



Spain, and under the most i 



economic conditions, from Britain to 
Yugoslavia, attempts to control 
wages did not work. 

The report says that, basically, 
there were six factors overriding in 
the breakdown of wage watchdog 
systems: 

1. Failure to back up the wage 
freeze with a sufficiently stability- 
oriented economic policy. 

2. An institutionalized connection 
between wages and the cost of living 
index in seven countries acted as a 
built-in inflator. 

3. The government and employ- 
ers often felt incentive increases 
beyond the law were necessary for 
peace. 

4. Companies with above- 
average profits as a result of 
increased productivity or efficiency 
were inclined to purchase worker 
loyalty with special bonuses. 

5. When leading labor organiza- 
tions negotiated wage settlements, 
some firms not indirectly affected 
corrected upward through special 
arrangements. 

6. When wage guidelines are set, 
men and women in the lower wage 
brackets are usually given above- 
average emoluments. Higher income 
earners then pressed for similar gains 
to retain the differential.

QUESTION: We have some friends who can get eggs for us 

fairly cheaply. With meat prices so high, I would like to rely 
more heavily on eggs as a source of protein. I am fearful, 
however, to use too many eggs because of the reported 
dangers of high cholesterol intake. How many eggs would 
be considered "too many"? My husband and I are both 21 
i health. 



: American diet contains very large amounts 
of saturated fats and cholesterol. Accumulating evidence 
indicate that for some people there is a 
relationship between dietary intake of saturated fats and 
cholesterol and subsequent development of certain types of 
cardiovascular disease. The exact causes or links between 
dietary intake and these diseases have not been firmly 
established. Disliking the possibility of becoming 
prematurly debilitated, I have become convinced that there 
is good reason to play it on the safe side by considerab ly 
curtailing one's fat and cholesterol intake. 

Women appear to be more fortunate than men with 
regard to degeneration of the arteries and appear relatively 



what that is worth. Therefore, lacking a family history of 
vascular difficulties, younger women generally do 
not have to worry about cholesterol intake. In infants and 
children, there is some evidence that decreased calorie 
intake results in the formation of fewer fat cells which 
might make them less prone to obesity later in life. 

What all this means is that you could probably get away 
with eating all the eggs you wanted to but your husband 
would be wise to limit himself to one half a dozen eggs in his 
entire diet during the week. This includes eggs from all 
that it leaves him very little leeway for having 
eggs for breakfast other than perhaps one or two per week. 
Other steps you can take to decrease cholesterol intake is to 
use skim milk (if you use the powdered variety you will 
lot of money) and the avoidance of organ meats and 
shell fish. Shell fish contain no fat but have large amounts of 
cholesterol. Coconut oil, used as a dairy substitute is 
tremendously high in saturated fats. Peanut butter, 
especially the old fashioned type made just by grinding up 
the nuts is an excellent source of protein and does not 
saturated fat or cholesterol. Your dietary situation 
can also be enhanced by using corn oil margarine and corn 
or safflower oil in your cooking since these unsaturated fats 
tend to have a beneficial effect. Fish and poultry are 
excellent sources of protein but are low in fat and 
cholesterol. Unfortunately, the price of these has risen. 
You can get useful publications on low fat diets from the 
Heart Association, 44 East 23rd St., N.Y. 10010. 



QUESTION: I have been told that bathing in water that has 
been treated with bath salts or oils can be harmful to the 
vagina. Is this true? 

ANSWER: In a normal sitting position in a bathtub, the 
vagina is fairly exposed and soapy water can enter it. 
Occasionally, one hears of women who have developed 
irritations in the area around the opening of the vagina and 
have traced this to using a particular soap or bath 
preparation. Obviously, this does not affect the vast 
majority of women. A more dangerous situation was 
uncovered several years ago involving the use of bubble 
baths by little girls. Here the soapy water had a sufficiently 
irritating and penetrating quality so as to enter the urethra 
(the tube leading to the bladder) and resulted in some 
urinary tract infections. Fur ilm n-j^m |H'(imlricians often 
advise against the use of bubble baths for little girls. I don't 
know enough about the bubble bath behavior of grown

CAN A CAR 
IMPROVE WITH AGE? 



Recenlly. Road Test Magazine had 
this to say about Volvo: 

"Volvo is the type of ear that the longer 
you live with it, the more you respect it!' 

While were 
flattered by such 
heady praise.we can't 
say we're terribly 
surprised. 

For you see, 
we've spent the last 
eleven years design - 
ingand refining 
Volvo.building things 
into it that take 
almost that long to 
fully savor. 

You'll probably 
sense the advantage 
of Volvos 4-wheel 
disc brakes the first 
time you come to a 
panic stop. But it may 
take you ages, if ever, 
to appreciate our 
triangular-circuit 
braking system.which 
suppl ies about 80% of 
braking power if one 
circuitshouldeverfail. 

And it may take a long trip with the 
family before you get the full taste of 
Volvo's interior. 

With orthopedically-designed bucket 
seats that adjust to the needs of your spine 

With about as much legroom and 
trunk space as some of the largest luxury 
sedans made. 

And a ten-outlet heating system that 




warms the passengers in back without 
wilting the ones in front. 

Tuck into enough tight parking spaces, 
weave through enough frantic cities, and 
you'll revel in yet 
another Volvo virtue 
that seems to grow 
more virtuous with 
time. 

A turning circle 
actually as small as the 
Volkswagen Beetle's. 

Wait for a f 
freeway night and 
you'll gain a clearer 
understanding of why 
Volvo is surrounded 
by 3800 square inches 
of glass. With no so- 
called opera windows 
to heighten the drama. 

And you'll

oversomeof the worst

the integrity of 
Volvos body.

Netters defeated by 
Spring Arbor, 6-3 



By REX PUTT 

The Indiana-Purdue Mastodons 
met their roughest challenge of the 
year as they were defeated by Spring 
Arbor, 6-3, in a tennis match at the 
victor's court on Thursday, October 
18, 1973. 

The netters from Spring Arbor 
captured the first four single matches 
before Dave Goldsmith was able to 
subdue his opponent in number five 
singles. Mike Sehone followed with a 
second victory for the Maslodons, but 
the match win was quickly taken by 
Spring Arbor as their number one 
doubles team breezed over the 
Mastodon's best, 

Steve Spoltman suffered his first 
setback of the season in singles 



competition, but he failed to lose his 
pride as he doubled up with Tom 
White to crush their opponents in 
number three doubles. The Masto- 
dons were handicapped at the 
beginning when GalenVordy, their 









compete in singles competition. They 
also played without Steve Beltz, who 
has been playing number three for 
most of the season. With the absence 
of these two, it was necessary for 
Coach Bolyard to move every man up 

Despite the handicap, Coach 
Bolyard accepted the defeal graceful- 
ly, noting that the top two men for 
Spring Arbor had played last year for 
a Junior College team that was 
runner-up in the Junior College 
National Tennis 



Maslodons showed great poise 
against the more experienced Spring 
Arbor team. The 6-3 score indicates 
that it was a close match and not a 
slaughter. Indiana-Purdue has yet to 
score less than three points in a 
match, and they sport a very 
respectable 7-4 record. They will play 
their final match of the season at the 
Wildwood Racquet Club against 
Indiana Tech on the 25th of October

2 unbeaten teams to 
clash for championship 



ByVINCELOCHBIHLER 

It looks as though the November 4 
meeting between Stoneface and Smith 
will decide the regular season 

Flaglootball League. Barring upsets, 
it will also match two teams with 
perfect records. 

This week's action saw the 
Geology Club forfeit to Circle K while 
the Super Jocks beat the Frosh 14-0 
and Stoneface demolished the 73 
Calt's 32-6. Smith had the bye. 

The Geology Club picked up 
another loss as they failed to show for 
their game with Circle K. The loss 
kepi the Geology Club winless in four 



contests while Circle K pushed their 
record to 3-2. 

The other 1:30 game saw Stone- 
face romp to a 32-6 win over the 73 



streak of five i 

The later contest saw the Super 
Jocks beat the surprising Frosh squad 
14-0. The first half went scoreless as 
the Frosh defense proved equal to the 
Super Jock offense. In the second 
frame, Kevin Tonne tossed two 
liiuchdown p.i^i'v "iK'to John Hayes 
and the other to Don Yadon. Doug

The Indiana-Purdue soccer team 
lost to North Manchester and Hunt- 
ington College last week. The local 
kickers, although forfeiting the 
games beforehand because of ineligi- 
ble players, experimented with differ- 
l people at new positions to help 
t year's competition. 

The soccer squad lost to North 
Manchester College 3-1 last Friday at 
the victors' field. Host Manchester 
scored twice in the opening half and 
held the Mastodons to only four shots 
on goal. 

Ed Shankster opened the scoring 
after fifteen minutes had elapsed on a 
hard shot from the right side of the 
goal. With 4:10 remaining in the half, 
Dave Drostar put Manchester ahead 
2-0 as his shot rippled the left side of 
the net. 



Shankster again scored early in 
the second half for Manchesters final 
tally. The IU-PU squad, under the 
threat of being shutout for the first 
time this year, finally scored on Terry 
Younghan's penalty kick. 

Against Huntington Tuesday, the 
Mastodons had to go with a new goalie 
because of an injury to starter Terry 
Kundysek. 

The visiting Foresters got off to a 
fast start with two first half 
goals— the first by Mike McGee at the 
twelve minute mark and the other by 
Steve Tyson. 

In the second half, right winger 
Phil Roberts decided to use his head 
and scored two goals. The first came 
on a pass from Vince Lochbihler and 
Roberts "headed" his second on a 
pass from Terry Younghans to tie the 

Younghans put the Mastodons 



ahead 3-2 on a shot past the Forester 
goalie. Ed Schmieman and Phil Freck 
assisted on the play. But Huntington 
scored three final goals in the last 
fifteen minutes to post the 5-3 victory. 





Berkeley breeding ground 
for athletic revolution 



ByLORENTATE 

Since Pete Elliott coached the 
University of California into the Rose 
Bowl 15 years ago, the Bears have 
secured far more recognition in fields 
greatly removed from the gridiron. 

For while the team has won a 
meager 55 of 145 football decisions, 
the Berkeley campus has firmly 
established itself as the focal point of 
dissident reaction in this nation. 

During the 1960's, when social 
reform and antiwar movements 
rocked the nation's campuses, Cal 
was "national headquarters." 

Nor did this breeding ground for

For the first time on a broad 
scale, athletes ceased to respond 
instinctively to their coaches' de- 
mands. They began to ask: "Why?" 
And blacks, who once "stayed in line" 
athletically because it provided the 
primary path to social improvement, 
employed their numbers in a manner 
which stunned athletic departments 
from coast to coast. Boycott became 
the most feared word in the coaches' 
dictionary. 

The athletic upheaval which took 
rot in Berkeley brought about open 
disruptions on more than 100 college 
campuses. 

Writing from the Cal campus in 
his book, "The Athletic Revolution," 
Jack SfcoLi opined: 

"The revolt of black athletes, 
which began in earnest during 1968, 
caught the white American sports 
establishment completely off guard... 
because it mistakenly assumed that 
the docility and acquiescence com- 
mon in Negro athletes of the past was 
an inherent quality rather than a 
posture Negroes had adopted as the 
only way to survive in a racist sports

Individuals labeled as "trouble- 
makers" by the Establishment -

concerns above their commitment to

athletes already there. 

Demands grew out of squad

defiant terms. 

Elsewhere, coaches demanded

Intramural football observations 

The Intramural Flag Football regular season is about over with only 
three weeks of action remaining. Here is a quick analysis of each team 
from someone who played against them. These summaries are my own 
and not based on current standings. 

My choices for the top two teams are Smith and Stoneface. I would 
give the edge to Smith because of their superior offensive squad. The 
"general" of the team is quarterback Joe Clinkenbeard who calls a good 
game. The offensive line gives him good protection and the ends are 
talented receivers. Hank Kuleza is the key to the big matchup of these 
two teams on November 4. 

Stoneface has got the best defense against the rush and their pass 
defense is no fluke. The offense really hasn't been able to get on track in 
their recent games against Circle K and the Super Jocks. Probably one of 
the highlights of the team is their punt returns. Steve Ottenweller has 
scored about three touchdowns for the specialty squad. 

The Super Jocks are currently third on my list. Brock Abie's troops 
have yet to put over 25 points on the board in one game. The defense is 
tough and aggressive but the offense will keep them from an upset over 
Smith next week. Kevin Tonne had a couple of touchdown passes last 
week but unless a drastic change occurs—look out for Smith to post a 
shutout. 

The Frosh is rated fourth. This team is just getting used to the game 
and has proven that they can play with the best. Against Smith, the 
freshman team was down only 13-6 at the half while they held the Super 
Jocks scoreless in the opening stanza. The defensive line has been tough 
but the backfield has been a disappointment. When the playoffs come, 
don't be surprised if this team pulls off an upset. 

Circle K is next, but could very well be third depending on the 
outcome of their November 4 meeting with the Super Jocks. Most of the 
team members are ex-New Haven players and the defense has been 
tough all year. They beat the Frosh 2-0 and lost to last year's champs 
Stoneface by only 8-0. If the offense gets going, watch out for Circle K! 

I have to rate the 73 Calt's next because my team (Frosh) hasn't 
played them yet. Players around the league say that the 73 Calt's are 
really improving since the opening week. November 4 is the time to find 
out when the Frosh battle them in the lone 2:30 contest. 

Finally, there is the Geology Club. What can you say about a team 
which has forfeited half their games already this year? Maybe next 

There you have a quick analysis of all the teams. The games are at 
1:30 and 2:30 at City Utilities Park and fans are encouraged to attend. 
Admission is free and the games prove very exciting.
