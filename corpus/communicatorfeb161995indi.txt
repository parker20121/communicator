On Tuesday. IPFW Chancellor 
Michael Wattell announced 
Stanley "Bulch" Perchan will be 
the new director of intercollegiate 
altileiics at IPFW, beginning on 
March 1. 

Perchan. who recently resigned 
as athletic director of Tri-State 
University (TSU), graduated from 
Ashland University in 1969. He 
was a high school teacher until 
1974. when he became the assis- 
tant to tbe director of athletics at 
Tri-Slate University. 

In 1981. Perchan became the 
dean of students at TSU. He left 
TSU for a year to become director 
of sates and 
marketing at 
Lubertronics, 
Inc., then 
returned to 
become direc- 
tor of athlet- 
ics al TSU in 
1984. 

"We're 
very pleased 
to welcome Dutch Perchan to the 
IPFW family." Wanell said in the 
opening statement of a press con- 
fcttitice. 

Wartell was optimistic about 
Pcrchan's potential al IPFW. "We 
know that he will do a wonderful 
job for us, and wc look forward to 
increasing the quality of an 
already excellent program here at 
IPFW." he added. 

Perchan said he looks forward 
to his position at IPI^. "Dorothy 
(Perchan's wife) and I are thrilled 
to be a part of the IPFW fami- 
ly...We are excited about the chal- 
lenges that are going to be before 
us at IPI^." he said. 

Perchan toured the campus on 
T\icsday. He added that he wanted 
to turn IPFW's athletic program 
into the premier program in the 
nation's division II ranks. 

A large market for college ath- 
letics exists in Fort Wayne, 
according to Perchan. He said he 
thought tbe media coverage and 
athletic facilities are excellent, 
and IPFW has a good start for 
where he wanLs to tale the pro- 
gram. 

IPFW's present athletic direc- 
tor. Arnie Ball, will step down 
and become an assistant to the 
athletic director. He will also 
devote more lime to coaching the 
men's volleyball team.

employment. "I have been aware 
for some time that tbe vice chancel- 
lor has been reconstructing several 
positions within his division, and 
mine was intended lo be one that be 
restruciured," Callen said. 

Acconling to Callen, he was not 
involved in his department's 
revampment and therefore believes 
his current position is now intended 
for someone else. When asked 
about the nature of the unrenewed 
contract, he had no comment, but 
redirected the question io the vice 
chancellor. 



Chapman, who came to the uni- 
versity seven years ago, after a 
national search, has already left the 
university. She had no comment 
about her dismissal. 

According to Marian 
Zimmerman, dean of students. 
Chapman has been gone since the 
end of December and Judy Gillman 
is currently the interim director. 

Jane Silva, former assistant 
director of development, said, "I 
know two people for sure who were 
asked lo leave, but most of the peo- 
ple thai I've noticed that were not 



asked to return were women over 
fifty." 

IPFW Chancellor Michael 
Wanell denied the university has or 
is discriminating against its employ- 
ees or former employees. "That is 
simply not true," Wanell said. "The 
university does noi discriminate." 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Frank BorelU said. "I have 
no comment about personnel mat- 
ter." 

Wanell said, "I cannot comment 
about personnel matters. It is uni- 
versity policy."

College students investigate 
employment opportunities 



By Adum Sanders 
GuesI Wrller 

Over 1000 students from across 
tbe nation assembled Monday in a 
quest for employment at the eighth 
annual Careers *95 conference in 
Chicago. Students from over 25 
universities crossed the nation to 
meci with 45 companies during the 
job fair. 

Co-founder and Executive Vice 
Prcsidcni of Careers "95 Joe Price 
said, "1 am very pleased with the 
turnout. Employer numbers are up 
and student numbers have been 
holding steady over ihe past couple 
of years." 

Students interacted with repre- 
sentatives from companies with 
hopes of fmding a contact within a 
company, getting noticed, deliver- 
ing a resume, or just meeting peo- 
ple, 

Brian Bush, a senior at Indiana 
University, said, "1 think a good 
number of students have come here 
to do some networking. I certainly 
don't expect to get an interview 
today, but I wanted lo meet as 
many people as I could and find out 
as much as possible about the com- 
panies." 

Meeting with employers can be 
stressful and some students were 
content to relieve their job jitters. 
Caroline Grolsh, a junior at Boston 
College, said, "1 was real nervous 
coming in here. I didn't know what 
to expect. So 1 went to the Peace 
Corps people first because I 
thought they would be nice. Afler I 
was done . . . my anxiety was 
gone." 



Careers '95 recruits students 
from across the nation in an attempt 
to accommodate employer needs 
with student abilities. "We try to 
match ihe needs of the companies 
with the types of students 
involved," Price s.iid. "Some peo- 
ple think that you have to be from 
Har,'ard or Yale to get a job these 
days but that's simply untrue. There 
arc great students at every school 
and we try to go to the instinitions 
with students who are recruited less 
than other schools. We aim for vari- 
ety as well as quality." 

The range of companies was 
diverse as ihe students were. Some 
companies and agencies involved 
were: the Peace Corps, United 
States Secret Service. E&amp;J Gallo 
Winery. Toys R Us. The Dial 
Corporation, andTerminix. 

Among the most popular was 
General Electric. Founded in 1892, 
GE earns over S59 billion in rev- 
enues white employing 217.000 
people worldwide. They hired 
approximately 1. 000 people for 
entry level positions in 1994. 
During Careers '95 Chicago, GE 
received over 500 applications and 
resumes. OE was interested in a 
wide variety majors and drew most 
of the applicants at the job fair. 

In contrast, the Garmer Group, a 
small information technology com- 
pany founded in 1979. had never 
recruited from colleges until 1993. 
when they put in place an entry- 
level recruiting program. The pro- 
gram has annually increased its 
enrollment by thirds. Garmer repre- 
sentative Thomas Bass explained, 
"We were surprised by the enor- 



mous response. This is our first 
year with Careers "95 and we got 
about 200 resumes." 

Ganner representative Bass said 
he looked for students with good 
communication skills. "I look for 
people with personality, someone 
who is intelligent bul can also carry 
themselves well. Grades aren't as 
important if the candidate can com- 
municate and analyze well," Bass 
explained. 

Chris Thomas, a representative 
of Honda North America, Inc., said 
his company received 150 resumes. 
"We just can't estimate how many 
people we will be interested in. The 
range has varied widely from con- 
ference to conference." Thomas 
staled that he looked for people 
who were "car nuts", interested in 
personal and career paths. "We're 
looking for someone who knows 
what they want to do." Thomas 
said. 

A high GPA docs not guarantee 
success at Honda, according to 
Thomas. "I've seen engineers with 
2.2s work out better than 4.0s." he 
explained. 

According to Peterson's Annual 
Guide 10 Careers and Employment, 
only seven percent of entry-level 
positions are hired through career 
fairs. Sandy McGuigan. direaor of 
career development at Valparaiso 
University, said that 5-10 percent of 
Valparaiso's class of '94 received 
jobs through career fairs. Katy 
Bergstrom, a senior at Bradley 
University, said, "Even if I don't 
gel a job from this (Careers

Currently ihere are three univer- 
sity administration positions avail- 
able Last year's national search for 
a dean of education did not fill the 
position. Acting Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Fred Kirchhoff 
announced his resignation from the 
university this week, and the posi- 
tion of executive director of univer- 
sity affairs is still vacant, as well as 
several faculty positions. 

Kirchhoff indicated that it usual- 
ly takes thiee to four months to fill 
a position, and that it will be the 
responsibility of the future director 



of university affairs to fill 
Chapman's former position. He 
said that the search to fill the execu- 
tive affairs position is already 
underway and should be filled .soon. 
He said he could not comment 
on the replacement for Callen's 
position, 

Zimmerman, however, stated 
that Callen will be with the univer- 
sity until the end of May. He wilt be 
replaced by a new director who will 
take charge effective June 13. 



Vice Chancellor 
addresses 
financial aid 
problems 



By Nol T. Bcckley 
News Editor 

In response to the growing num- 
ber of students frustrated widi the 
financial aid office. Frank Borclli, 
vice chancellor of student affairs. 
has identified three major difficul- 
ties facing the Office of 
Scholarships and Financial Aid: 
staffing, technology and chcnt ser- 
vices. 

'The fnjstration is shared by the 
financial aid staff; they don't like to 
be in a position where they can't 
respond quickly and accurately to 
student requests," Borclli said. 

These areas were also identified 
in Purdue University Financial Aid 
Director Joyce Hall's report on 
IPlAV's financial aid office. 

"We already know what the 
[problems] are. but when you are 
totally immersed in an operation of a 
unil, sometimes it's a good idea to 
slep back and have somebody come 
in to look at it who hasn't seen it. 
because ihey can point out things 
that can help you." Borelli said. 

The three areas needing improve- 
ment are: 

•Staffing: The current staff has not 
increased compared to with Ihe 
amount of loan applicalions. "We've 
had ... a tripling of the loan volume 
without a corresponding increase in 
the [financial aid office] staff," 
Borclli said. 

•Technology: Currently all loan 
applicalions are processed by hand 
and the financial aid office is nut 
able to electronically follow sludent 
records. On March I. a new sludent 
information system will come on 
line and will help tbe financial aid 
office speed up its response lime to 
student queries, said Borelli. 
■Client services: According lo 
Borelh, the rotation of people at the 
front desk and manning the tele- 
phone could be improved. He called 
this a management issue in terms of 
staff training and development. The 
insiallmeni of the student informa- 
tion system will be an immense help 
to the students and to the people 
behind the from desk. "Wiih the 
staff so shori ihey divide up the 
tasks perhaps in a way which we 
could do better." Borelli said. 

"We're trying lo do belter by our 
students. . .and 1 think there will be a 
notable improvement by nexi fall," 
said Borelli. 

Borelli also announced that 
Roben Zellars of Southeast Missouri 
Stale will take over the responsibili- 
ties of financial aid office director 
on March 1 . 

"The whole staff would like to 
welcome Roben Zellars to IPFW 
and we are eager lo see how he can 
help us." said Gary Davis, associate 




Borelli 



director of the financial aid office. 

To assist Zellars in becoming 
comfonabic witli IPFW financial aid 
office, Borelli asked Hall to submit 
her aforementioned report recom- 
mending-areas needing impnavemcnt 
within IPl-'W's financial aid office. 

"I don't think students need to 
know every line of the recommcnda- 
Iton. . .our job 
is to take 
those recom- 
mendations 
and see which 
of those 
apply, which 
of those we 
agree with 
and which of 
those we can 
do something 
about," 
Borelli said. 

Zellars will be given Hall's rec- 
ommendations and will become 
acquainted with IPFW procedure 
when Zellars arrives at IPFW. 

In a telephone interview, Zellars 
said there were some issues that 
needed to be addressed and he want- 
ed students to know that the finan- 
cial aid office docs want to help. 

"There are high expectations of 
me and I hope to meet those expec- 
tations," Zellars said. "My primary 
goal is good customer service," he 

Zellars expressed a desire to 
receive student input and will possi- 
bly form student groups to better 
communicate with the financial aid 
office. Zetlars also reiterated 
Borclli's point about the need to 
improve technology. Once it occurs, 
Zellars said he believed many of tbe 
current difficulties would be solved. 

Zellars had high praise for the 
current financial aid staff. "Gary 
Davis is extremely dedicated. . .1 
know everyone in that office wants 
to serve siudenis belter." he said. He 
also praised the university for its 
commitment in implementing the 
new student information system. 

"We are continuously looking for 
ways to improve the efficiency of 
the financial aid office and the ser- 
vice to the students," Borelli said. 

Odier ways lo improve the finan- 
cial aid office which Borelli men- 
tioned were electronically transfer- 
ring funds into students' bank 
accounts, improving communica- 
tions between the Bursar's office 
and the financial aid office, and hav- 
ing the siudcni information system 
fully operational in 12 to 18 mondis. 

Zellars was bom in South Bend 
and received his roaster's degree 
from Indiana University- 
Bloomingion. He earned his doctor- 
ate from the University of Michigan.

IPFW volleyball coach Arnic 
Ball is pushing for his team lo setUc 
down and reduce its service errors 
and improve its passing perfor- 
mance. After Ihc American 
Airlines/Atncrican Eagle invitation-

After squeaking past winless

25 serving errors, which is way, 
way too many." 

In Friday's first match, LMU 
came back from a iwo-gamc deficit 
to defeat Lewis University (LU) 14- 
16, 3-15. 15-2. 17-15, 15-7 to

84 kills, including 82 by Zane 
S my the,

of a Gates Center crowd of 770. 
IPFW improved to 5-4 with the 
win. 

The Volleydons erred in service 
25 limes. URN had 28 service 
errors of its own. 

"Our passing was \-ery 



icni. In the last game and a half. 
Justin Luna. ..came in and solidified 
our passing," said Ball. 

IPFW recorded a .324 kill per- 
centage, including .462 by sopho- 
more Ricardo Solcr, who registered 
a career-high 23 kills for the match. 
Craig Collins and Felipe Ralat 
added 19 and 17 kills, respectively. 
Setter Scott Lauer assisted 72 kilLs. 

Ball staled. "We. ..try and take 
advantage of what the other team is 
doing defensively. ..Rici was the 
one who was available last night. 
He had an opportunity to score." 

Ail-American Jose Luis Estrada 
had a match-leading 35 kills for the 
Raiders. Jim Cassels added 17 kills 
and 10 digs. Estaban Rodriguez had 
23 assists for Ihe nighu

Examine the Life of Purdue Indiana Theater: 

A profile on Larry Life, IPFW Theater Department chair 



By Kan Whiting 
Features Editor 

Larry Life. When someone men- 
tions his name all Idnds of things 
pop into mind. Director, actor, 
adviser, friend. These words 
describe Life and what he is all 
aboul. Life has been around IPFW 
for the last 25 years and plans to 
stick around for many more years. 

The words used to describe Life 
above were not mine, but students 
of Life. Sophomore theater major 
Joel Moorman said thai "Larry has 
a loi of experience, and that is an 
understatement." Amy Qall. fresh- 
man theater major said that "he 
[Life] is a wonderful teacher. He 
caies a lot about this department 
[theater], which in lum cares about 



il5SludcnLs." 

This is Life's first season as the 

Theater Department chair he has 
already 
brought 
many posi- 



;ryf^ 



changes to 
the Purduc- 
Indiana 
Theater 
(PIT). Life 
said he 
feels that 
by bringing 
in guest 
performers, sluuents benefit 
immensely from the workshops. 
Both Ball and Moorman agreed 
with Life and said they enjoyed 



Lany Life 



working with guest performers 
Kristine Holtvedt and Dale Miller 
who are working on "Who's Afriad 
of Virginia Woolf." 

Besides being the Theater 
Dcpanmeni chair, director, choroe- 
grapher and adviser to students in 
the Theater department. Life also 
takes time to guest direct at theaters 
across the nation. 

He has worked with the theatre 
departments at Louisiana State 
University. Wabash College, 
Tulanc University, UNLV, Miami 
University of Ohio and Black Hills 
Play House in South Dakota. 

Life completed undergraduate 
and gradute work at Ball State 
University. After college Life went 
to New York and performed off- 



Droadway for a few years. He went 
down south to Texas and taught for 
a while. Finally, he came back lo 
Indiana and took a position at IPFW 
in 1971, 

Life started dancing at age 
seven, he has mastered ballet, jazz, 
tap and .some modem dance. Life 
docs a lot of choreograptiy for PIT 
and other suites across the nation, 
but he also knows his limitations. 

"It's important to know your 
limitations." commented Life. He is 
not a playwright because Life 
believes that although one should 
have a broad base of theater knowl- 
edge, one should also respect those 
who specialize in cenain areas like 
playwrighting. 

"I'm very much in awe of play- 



Student profiles: 

A glance at two new faces to the PIT stage 



Wrights," Slated Life. 

While juggling directing, travel- 
ing and acting, Life now has an 
important role as the department 
chair. His focus for the future 
stresses higher enrollment in the 
program and getting more sludcnis 
in the audience. "We arc a universi- 
ty theater and we arc here for the 
students as well as the community." 
explained Life. 

As for the department as a 
whole, Life said "it's really grow- 
ing and moving ahead and I think 
the students are incredibly exciting. 
I'm excited by the students and I'm 
pleased with the support the pro- 
gram is being given by the chancel- 
lor." 



YOU DONT HAVE 

TO DRINK 
TO RIDE DRUNK. 



By Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

One of this year's leading 
Purduc-Indiana-Theater (PIT) 
students is Amy Ball, a freshman 
majoring in theater. Yes, the 
men's volleyball coach's daugh- 
ter. But according to Amy Ball, 
"1 don't play volleyball." Instead. 
she is an actress on the PIT stage. 

Ball started her life on the 
stage at age 13. At Woodlan High 
School, Ball performed in "Once 
Upon a Mattress," "Our Town" 
and many other plays. Ball has 
also participated in many plays at 
the Civic Youth Theater in Fort 
Wayne. 

Ball said she likes the theater 
department at IPFW because of 
the small size. "I tike that the 
department isn't real big. You 
know you'll be involved," staled 
Ball. 

The small size is especially 
advantageous for freshmen. Ball 
recognized (he fact (hat if she 
were at another school, she prob- 
ably would not be able to per- 
form as much as she docs here. 

Interestingly enough, these 
sentiments arc echoed by another 
PIT performer, Joel Moorman. 
The name Moorman is not new 
to the PIT stage; Moorman's

mother graduated from IPFW in 
1972 with a degree in theater. 
One could say that Moorman is 
following in his mother's foot- 
steps. 

Moorman is relatively new to 
the PIT stage because he recently 
transferred lo IPFW from Ball 
State. Currently he is working on 
"Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Wooir with Ball. 

Moorman also started in the- 
ater at an early age. Moorman 
started at age seven. He has per- 
formed in 15-16 shows at (he 
Civic Youih Theater including 
"Peter Pan," "Cinderella" and 
"Tom Sawyer," just to name a 
few. Moorman continued to act 
through high school at Bellmont 
High School. At Bellmont, he 
performed in plays such as "Our 
Town," "The Sound of Music," 
"South Pacific," "The King and 
I" and "Singing in the Rain." 

Moorman said he feels that 
IPFW's Theater Department is 
great, especially its young actors. 
'This is a wonderful theater. It's 
smaller, it's new and the thrust 
stage is fun to work with," com- 
mented Moorman. 

"IPFW sticks lo educational 
Ihcaler- you can learn a lot," 
Moorman explained. Moorman is

Life invites to help wiih the

Q&amp;A 



Q: Which lubricants 
are safe to use with 
condoms? 

A: Water-based 
lubricants— such as KY 
Jelly and Astroglide— are 
the only ones that are 
safe. Do NOT use oil- 
based lubricants— such 
as vaseline, cooking oil, 
or hand lotion— as these 
weaken latex, making it 
likely to break.

Fourth Amendment 
rights worth protecting 



The Bill of Righls is Ihcrc lo 
protcd tlic righls of ihe ciii/cns of 
iho United Siaies. One righi it pro- 
lecis. ihfougb tbe Fourib 
Afncndmcril, is ihc righi lo be safe 
in our own borne, Tbu amendmeni 
says. The right of ihc people lo be 
secure in their persons, houses, 
papers, and effects, against unrea- 
sonable searches and seizures, shall 

not be violated, and 

no warrants shall 
issue, but upon proba- 
bJc cause, supporting 
by Oath or affirma- 
tion, anil particularly 
describing the place 
t6 be searched or 
things to be seized." 
Anyone who thinks 
Ibis right is not 
important should 
imagine what it 
would be like if Ihc 
police could walk 
into our homes and 

search anytime they 

wiinicd. 
. If the Republicans get their way 
thiii is exactly what will happen. 
They have introduced a bill in Uie 
house called the "Exclusionary 
Rule Reforni Aci of 1995." A simi- 
lar bill, entitled "The Violent Crime 
Conlrol and Law Enforcement Act 
of 1995" bas been introduced in the 
Senate. 

These reforms would allow fed- 
er^ Law enforcement agents lo per- 
form warrantless searches. They 
would be able to bre^ into homes 
and businesses and conduct search- 
es, as long as it is in "good faith." 

What does "good faith" mean 



" iTie right of the 

people to be secure 

in their persons, 

houses, papers 

and effects, against 

unreasonable 

searches and 

seizures, shall 

not be violated ..."

and how will it be proved in a coun 
of law? Currently people are pro- 
teacd from warrantless searches If 
law enforcement agents conduct 
warranlless searches the evidence 
gathered can not be used in a coun 
of bw ThLs deters law enforcement 
agents from resorting lo illegal 
means to obtain evidence. 

If the changes introduced by tbe 

Republicans in 

Congress are institut- 
ed, law enforcement 
agents will no longer 
be required to prove 
they have reason to 
enter and search our 
homes. In fact, they 
may enter and search 
for any reason what- 
soever. After the fact 
they will have plenty 
of lime to develop a 
cause that would be 
in "good faith." 
How are we, as 

citii'.ens of the United 

States, expected to be able to feel 
safe in our own homes if police can 
walk in and conduct a search any 
time they like? The Fourth 
Amendment protects one of our 
inalienable righls. The govcmmeni 
docs not have the right to lake this 
away from us; these rights are there 
for a reason. Looking back in histo- 
ry, people have been afraid in their 
own homes. If we want to feel 
secure, then ibe people of the 
United Slates need to make sure 
thai their Fourth Amendment rights 
slay securely in place.

East Allen Community 
Schools need changes 



, 'East Allen Community Schools 
are currently introducing a scries of 
changes to desegregate tbeir school 
syistem. These changes include 
closing some schools, and moving 
all sixth through eighth grade stu- 
dents into the high schools. 

East Allen bas waited loo long to 
make these changes. The disparities 
between Ihese schools are ridicu- 
lous. No student should feel like the 
school they attend is obviously 
inferior or superior. 

People inherently resist change. 
Tea years down the road, residents 
of the school district will be happy 
that they've made these changes. 
The students will be more well- 
rounded, and they will have a wider 
array of subjects available to them. 

With the pfcsjnii situation, small- 
er schools arc having a hard lime 
offering all the subjects students' 
require The larger school buildings 
arc full to capacity. By allowing 
parents the option of moving their 



children to magnet schools, the 
school system has made a move in 
the right direction. 

All school systems should allow 
students the right to chose between 
all of the schools in the system. If 
the school district would offer spe- 
cific specialized programs at each 
school. East Allen schools would be 
more able to address the needs of 
all its students. 

Residents of the East Allen 
County school district need lo mon- 
itor the progress of these reforms 
closely. Although most of die pro- 
posals the school district has come 
up with seem sound, the realities of 
these programs may vary gready. In 
order lo assure a quality education 
for all students in die area, parents 
and community members need to 
be open to change: however, they 
should also be wary of any changes 
. ihat compromise education in ihe 
name of desegregation.

A Dose of Douse 

Psychological 
reparations are in order 



By F. Lane Douse 
Guest Columnist 

The deadline is February 27. 
1995. 

On that day Ihe govcmmeni of 
Ihe United Slates of Amerika is 
supposed 10 pay every single 
African- American Ihe sum of $5 
million dollars as a reparation for 
the African-American Holocaust 
known as slavery. 

Will this happen? 
Let's Just put il like this. I'm 
not writing any checks that aren't 
covered by the current balance in 
my checking account. 

Reparations, or Ihe making of 
amends (for some terrible injus- 
tice), according to Webster's dic- 
tionary, is an on-going battle 
waged by African-Americans 
against this government. 

1 think il is lime for African- 
Americans to realize that ihe 
Amerikan govemmeni (the elite 
while folk of this country) are 
not going to give them any type 
of monetary reparation simply 
because they aintinue to not rec- 
ognize and accept Ihc indirect 
responsibility for Ihe atrociiies 
their ancestors have commilied 
againsi people of color in this 
country. 

Of course, if one examines the 
reparations made for Native 
Americans. I don't think being 
rounded up and kenneled on a 
reservation is sufficient enough 
for African- Americans. By Ihe 
way, I find il amusing that the 
definition for reservation is the 
act of keeping back,- witJiolding, 
or selling apart, or a tract of pub- 
lic land sel apart for a special 
purpose, as for the use of an 
Indian tribe. Il's amazing how 
both dermiiions of the word indi- 
rectly corrolaie with what one 
calls the gheilo or inner city: a 
place where African -Americans 
have been socially set apart and 
prevented from participating in 
the social slruciure of the United 
Slates. 

If one investigates the history 
of African-Americans in this 
country, he or she will leam that 
people of color were brought 
over here for one reason only; to

work for Ihe while man. It 
doesn't mailer who else had 
slaves at this point in lime, it is 
Ihc fact that enslaved Africans 
were treated the most inhumane- 
ly by Ihe descendants of disad- 
vantaged Europeans (poor while 
Europeans) who were only acting 
out the negative experiences suf- 
fered from Ihe class discrimina- 
tion Ihcy were exposed to wiihin 
the European culture. 

Frances Cress Wclsing, an 
African-American psychiatrist, 
discusses in her book, "The Isis 
Papers," ihc interaction and 
response while Europeans had 
towards Africans. 

Weising stales: 
"This psychological response, 
whether conscious or uncon- 
scious, revealed an inadequacy 
based on the most obvious part 
of their being, their external 
appearance. As might be antici- 
pated in lerms of modem psycho- 
logical theories, whites defen- 
sively developed an uncontrol- 
lable sense of hostility and 
aggression. This attitude has con- 
tinued lo manifest itself through- 
out the history of mass con- 
frontations between whites and 
people of color." 

Because of the insiiiuiion of 
slavery and (he denial of it. while 
folks continue to ireat the 
descendants of Ihc enslaved 
Africans as second cla.ss citizens. 

So. Ihe first step towards repa- 
rations for African-Americans is 
for while folks to realize thai 
they benefit from white privilege 
or while skin. 

I think, from the brief example 
I have given regarding the treat- 
ment of African-Americans in 
this country, any individual can 
realize that if one has white skin 
one benefits from the domination 
of nol only just African- 
Americans but also Native 
Americans, the Chinese and so 
forth. It is because of ihis inhu- 
mane trealmcnl that racism was 
created to justify the institution 
of slavery. 

Jim Wallis. editor of 
Sojourner?, addresses die issue of 
racism in his article. "Whites' 
Racist Attitudes are a Serious 
Problem" 

Wailis slates, "To benefit from 
domination is lo be responsible 
for it. Merely to keep personally 
free of the taint of racist attitudes 
is both illusory and inadequate. 
Just to go along with a racist 
social structure, to acccpl eco- 
nomic order as il is. jusi to do 
one's job with impersonal institu- 
tions is to participate in racisriL 
Racism has to do with the power 
to dominate and enforce oppres- 
sion, and that power in America 
is in white hands. In fact, white 
racism is primarily a white 
responsibility." 

Need I say more? 



Homosexually Speaking: 

Gays want gays, not heterosexuals 

What is il with you straight 
guys, anyway? Whenever you 
encounter a gay man. you come 
to think thai we arc hilling on 
you. Lei me be Ihc one lo ease 
your mind. Nol every homosex- 
ual man is after every hetero- 



sexual guy. Sui 




This was a subject two years 
ago when President Clinton 
wanted to allow gays into Ihe 
miliiary. The issue of shower- 
ing with gay men was used to 
help win Ihe argument against 
leiting gays into the military. If 
you saw what I saw. the mem- 
bers of ihe media interviewed 
those who felt they would fall 
victim lo gazing homosexuals. 
None of these men were very 
attractive. I hate to admit it ,bul 
gay men are as shallow as 
straight men and are allracled id 
looks; looks thai none of these 
men had. If you talk to anyone 
else who feels Ihal gays will 
haunt and taunl ihem ihey arc 
not usually atliaciive either 

Could it also be that people 
who feel like the entire gay 
community is out to rape them 
are nol entirely secure about 
their own sexuality? Maybe 
those of you who think thai 1 
am flirting with you have some 
issues of sexuality Ihal you 
have not yet resolved. Perhaps 
you want to be hit on to sec if it 
is something that you want. If 
ihal is the case, why don't you 
try ... maybe we will respond. 

I feel safe in saying thai not 
many gay men are even attract- 
ed to straight men. Personally, I 
like a man who is a bit on the 
feminine side. Not a complete 



queen mind you, bul someone 
who is openly comforiablc 
about his sexuality. Mosl gay 
men will lell you that they want 
someone who is "straight act- 
ing," bul Ihal does not necessar- 
ily mean that he wants a 
straight man. 

In short, it takes more than 
simply being a man for gays lo 
be attracted to you. It helps if 
you have looks, charm and 
good personality. If you fear 
being wanted by homosexuals, 
then give yourself this Icsl. 
First, look in the mirror; what 
do you have lo offer a gay 
man? If il's nol more than what 
is between your legs, chances 
are wc don't want you. Second. 
if dales with women arc few 
and far between, why would a 
gay man want what women 
don't? Third, are the gay men 
looking at you in lust or dis- 
gust? There is a fine line 
between the Iwo and you need 
to leam which is which. 

If you are hit on by a gay 
man, take it as a compliment 
and move on. That's all that hit- 
ons really are. compliments. 
Gay men are complimented 
when girls hit on Ihem. so feel 
special when you are getting 
attention by a gay man. 

I would tike lo end with a 
personal note to a public figure 
in this city who thinks I was 
hilling on him one night in a 
bar. Let me lell you that you arc 
not someone I would be inter- 
ested in. even if you were gay. 
There were many other men 
who had a lot more lo offer 
than you. There is a reason why 
you were scoping out ai\ of Ihe 
ladies, because none were scop- 
ing you out . And finally, I've 
got a man. A wonderful man 
who has changed my life and 
who I want to be wilh 24 hours 
a day, seven days a week. I'm 
more of a man than you'll ever 
be, and more of a woman than 
you'll ever get. So you may 
now sleep sound knowing that I 
was nol out to gel you for sexu- 
al reasons.

Israeli Singers 
come to IPFW 



By Angk.Smllh 
Staff Wrlltr 

Enicring Williams Thcaier I 
didn'i know exactly what lo expect. 
I have never really been subject to 
miKh citllure in my life so I figured 
I would cilbcr hale Ihi.s assignmcni 
or I would love il. 

I wa.s the Tirsl patron to arrive ai 
Williams Thcalcr. I went in lo find 
a seal and found Noa and Gil Dor 
wanninj; up for ihe few songs ihey 
would perform during liieir presen- 
tation, J was toiaJly amaj:ed. 
Tbey were boih relaxed and teal. 
Their love of music was evidcni in 
the way in which ihcy carried them- 
selves, in the way they warmed up, 
and the way they moved to Ibe 
music. To (hem il was not just 
music or performance: it was their 
life, their feelings and their hcan. 
The music flowed through them, it 
run through their veins. The music 
was absolutely beautiful. Noa has 
the type of voice that when you 
bear i[ you're hypnotized, you gel 
chills all over and it moves you in a 
way thai is indescribable. 

Noa. bom in Israel, moved lo 
New York when she was one-and- 
a-half and was raised in the Bronx. 
She attended several very strict 
Jewish elementary schools and high 
schools. Her dream was to attend 
the High School of Performing Arts 
in New York, the same high school 
featured in the movie "Fame." 

She eventually persuaded her 
parcnLs into letting her attend this 
high school, which she found very 



compeiitive. In high school, she 
performed in musicals and stage 
productions. When Noa was 17 she 
moved back to Israel, where she 
Lves today. 

Gil was bom and raised in Israel, 
For about seven years in the 1970s 
he lived in America and attended 
Ihe Ramon School of Music for 
Contemporary and Jazz, music. Il 
was at this school that he met Noa. 
They then paired up and have been 
working together for 5 years. 

Together Ihey have produced 3 
albums. Their laiesi album, tilled 
"Noa." is an international release 
produced under the Gcffen label. 
They sing in both Hebrew and 
English: many of iheir Hebrew 
songs are Jewish poetry set to 
music. 

The songs Ihey performed in 
English arc inspired by their lives 
and feelings. For example, one of 
ihcir songs tided "Wildflower" 
reflects on Noa's childhood in New 
York. The duo avoids religous 
songs. A lot of Iheir music reflects 
their culture and their background, 
Noa is very open about her feelings 
toward their music. "Our album 
consists of original music, songs in 
English and in Hebrew. In general, 
we deal with both of those lan- 
guages and with a variety of differ- 
ent styles. I tiy to avoid calagoriz- 
ing what we do," she said. 

"In general it (music] shouldn't 
be defmed. it is difficuli lo define. 
You just need to listen to it and it 
cither effects you or it doesn't." 



Successful student director 



By Kura Whiting 
t'ealures tailor 

If you are familiar with IPFW 
theater than you probably have 
noticed a very successful student 
director. Greg Stieber, Siiebcr is 
cuiTcniJy a senior at IPFW who has 
been around the university for quite 
some time. 

Currently, Stieber is directing 
"Cadiolic School Girls," which sold

Purduc-indiana Theater (PIT) per-

Room" and "Follies." He has per- 
formed in "A Midsummer's Night 
Dream" at the Fort Wayne Civic 
Youth llicaler and in addition to his 
acting, he has also directed many 
shows at PIT and around town. 

Stieber did not si;tn acting until 



he began college here at IPFW. It 
was then that be realized he would 
pursue a career in the theater. Since 
he discovered his love for thelhe- 
ater Stieber has performed in many 
roles at PIT and several other Fort 
Wayne theaters as well. 

Although his emphasis is on act- 
ing, Stieber, a theater major, is also 
strongly interested in directing and 
play writing. 

Eventually Stieber said he plans 
to go to graduate school, but not 
until he is about 30 years old. He 
said he would like to go to Chicago 
and/or New York and see what is 
out there. "I like both places very 
much," cotmnented Stieber. 

After he completes his graduate 
work. Stieber would like lo leach at 
college level. 

Stieber said he was fonunaie to 
be able to direct two shows in one 
school year. "I'm incredibly lucky

Career -From page 1 

'95); il will have been worth com- 
ing. It's good to get some practice 
networking with employers. Some 
people gave up after talking with 
only one or two companies. I think 
iMose people really missed out." 

Since 1987, the Connecticut 
based Careers '95 company has 
been linking companies and stu- 
dents. This year they expect to take 
their relationship one step funher. 
Under contract from the city of 
Daylona, Career '95 expects lo plan 
a career fair during Ihe spring break 
weeks in March, 

"The formal will be a little dif- 
ferent but the basic process of inter- 
action will be the same," slated 
Price. Daylona seems adamant 
about improving its image, accord- 
ing to Price. 'The spring break pop- 
ulation has decreased from half a 
million ten years ago to about 



15.000. The city of Daylona is seri- 
ous about improving their image 
and the basic quality of life during 
and the basic quality of life during 
diose weeks," he said. 

Booths will be set up near the 
beaches. Studenis will have the 
chance to meet with companies and 
create handwritten resumes. The 
clothes and atmosphere of the con- 
ference may be casual and some of 
the employers are concerned. 

A representative from Honda 
pondered, "Will any of the students 
show up straight?" Price admitted 
thai was a concern, but he expected 
plenty of interest. "The number and 
demographics are there. 1 believe 
that there will be a large interest." 

Price said he met with Ihe 
Daylona chamber of commerce and 
things looked good. No companies 
have yet to committed but Price 
said he received "substantial inter- 
est" from companies.
