By Edward Nelson 



The last time Indi- 
ana was a battleground 
in the Democratic Pri- 
maries, all the Beatles 
were all still alive, Mar- 
tin Luther King Jr. was 
still giving speeches 



and the Vietnam War 
was still raging. 

Recently. Bill Clin- 
ton came to campaign 
in Fort Wayne, marking 
the first time in 40 years 
that Indiana's citizens 
will have an impact in 
choosing a Democrat- 
ic presidential candi- 
date. Speaking in front 
of a capacity crowd at 



tlie Grand Wayne Cen- 
ter, the former presi- 
dent promised citizens 
of the Summit City and 
surrounding areas that 
if Hillary wins Indi- 
ana's primary she will 
win the Presidential 
Nomination. He cited 
three reasons why he 
believes Hillary is the 
most qualified candi- 



date: she will be able to 
fix die struggling econ- 
omy, she would make 
a good commander- 
in-chief, and she is the 
best equipped to beat 
lohn McCain.

Hide and seek for 

hidden expenses 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

iudijl01@ipfw(Ledu 



When I receive my 
paycheck, the money 
is often gone before it 
hits the bonom of my 
checking account. My 
Spidey senses lel! me 
that I'm not the only 
student who feels that 
way - but where does 
all that money 
go? 



to wony about when 
you open your wallet. 
Most people only 
factor in major bills, 
such as rent, car loans, 
insurance, and God 
forbid, credit cards. 

Though it is 
important to put 
money aside for those 
big bills, it is also 
essendal that people 
on budgets think 



Your hard- 
earned cash 
has not run 
away and 

hidden from 

you, so don't , 
bother checking under 
the couch cushions 
or shaking down 
your sticky- lingered 
roommate for the 
goods. The likely culprit 
is you, miscalculating 
your total expenditures. 
(See, that word alone is 
worth S5.) 

Chew on diis: when 
budgeting monthly 
expenses, don't forget to 
figure in the incidentals, 
those things you may 
think are too 



"When you figure up 
your bills, think of little 
things such as these that 
can add up to big bucks/' 



small. Loolefor those 
litde extras you shell 
out money for, and 
write them down in a 
notebook somewhere 
so that you can track 
just how much you're 
spending. 

Next month, when 
you figure up your 
bills, think of Utde 
things such as these 
because they can add 
up to big bucks and a 
much lighter wallet: 



•Gas 

"Car maintenance 

•Groceries 

•Fastfood, 
conveniently located 
on campus 

•Weekend 
entertainment {movies, 
bar cover charges, etc.) 

•Restaurant tabs 

•Entertainment 
(DVDs, CDs. video 
games, etc) 

,^^ •Doctor visits 
or prescriptions 
•Clothing 
•Random 
splurges 

•Don't forget 
taxes! 
If any of these 
"minor" expenses apply 
to you. add a ballpark 
estimate loyour monthly 
list of bills. Factor in 
what means the most to 
you in terms of necessitj', 
and trim the financial fat 
where you can. 

Make these small 
changes and pretty 
soon, you won't have to 
shake down your shady 
roommate for laco or 
entertainment money

Obama speech exudes 

practicality, thoughtfulness 



An OP-ED 
By MARK PAGE 



In Philadelphia . 
on'Hjesday, Barack 
Obama graduated from 
rhetorical spinster to 
a social critic with the 
ability to bridge deep- 
seeded tensions with his 
eloquent elocution. 

Obama gave the 
speech on race relations 
in modern America 
to face down the flak 
he's gotten over his 
refusal to disown his 
former pastor and 
spiritual mentor Rev. 
Jeremiah Wright, after 
Wright's racist and anti- 
American comments 
were broadcast across 
the stratosphere. 

The speech not only 
took audience members 
through the history of 
racism in the United 
Slates, but also Obuma's 
own personal story of 
racial tension, a story 
about a family from 
each side of the racial 
divide, half Kansas and 
half Africa. He spun this 
talc, saying that even 
his white grandmother 



had admitted her 
fear of black men 
to him; something 
Obama said made him 
uncomfortable as a 
child. 

He took his stor&gt;' and 
pressed it against the 
history of our nation's 
racist past, weaving 
them together to tell 
not only why Wright 
may feel as he does, but 
also why working-class 
white America may 
espouse its own form 
of racial resentment. 
Obama said that though 
these resentments don't 
usually gel expressed 
in polite company, 
they sometimes spill 
over from kitchen table 
conversation into the 
"most segregated hour" ■ 
Sunday morning during 
church. 

The purity of the 
ideas Obama expressed 
during his 38-minute 
oration did not come 
untainted by posturing 
and politicizing. Obama 
twice mentioned 
Gcroldlne Ferraro, one 
of Hillary Clinton's 
fund-raisers and a 
former vice-presidential 
candidate, who created 



a firestorm when she 
said Obama's success 
could be attributed to 
his race. 

It was unnecessary 
for him to take a 
political shot at Clinton 
while speaking about 
the serious topic of 
racist undertones 
seeping to the surface of 
2 Ist-centuty America. 

Except the polidcal 
maneuvering, the 
speech was a noble 
undertaking. Too 
often in such a fierce 
campaign, old friends, 
even lifelong buddies, 
can be quickly thrown 
by the wayside the 
moment they say 
something unpopular. 

Clinton told Ferraro 
to hit the road recently 
and Obama nixed 
Samantha Power, one of 
his senior foreign policy 
advisers, both at record 
speeds. Sacrificing a 
friendship as obviously 
dear to Obama as 
Wright's, as quickly as a 
You'I\jbe video can load, 
would in itself show 
a lack of character far 
greater than attending 
a church witli a radical 
pastor.

decades. However, there 
is a problem. 

In a recent Neiv York 
Times article, Jay Carson, 
a Clinton campaign 
spokesperson, said that 
the schedules "by their 
nature don'i include a 
lot of the very kinds of 
things that gave her deep 
experience in her eight 
years there," 

[n order to make up 
for these tragic gaps, 
a few of the major 
events from Clinton's 
years of political and 
business experience are 
summarized ■ 

here. 

Clinton 
began her 
career as 
a lawyer, 
spending 
several years 

doing pro 

bono work 
in child advocacy. In 
1977, she wrote a review 
of Children's Policies: 
Abandonmcnl and 

Neglect by Gllberi Y. 
Steiner, In her review, 
she cTitidzcd Sleiner for 
his "cautious attitude 
toward governmental 
involvcmenl In child- 
rearing." 

What kind of 



services firm that 
handled herinvestments, 
was later fined by the 
Chicago Mercantile 

Exchange for violating 
margin trading rules. 
Clinton was never found 

guilty of any 

wrongdoing. 

From 1986 
to 1992, Clinton 
continued to 
gain experience 
in the business 
wo rid by serving 
^^__ on the board 
of directors of 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 

According to an 
interna! memopublished 
by ihe New York Times, 
ahnosi one-fifth of Wal- 
Mart employees have 
no health insurance. A 
report by Rep. George 
Miller states that, due to 
their low wages, many 
Wal-Mart employees 
receive housing 

assistance, low income 
assistance and help from 
other social programs. 

The average Wal- 
Mart employee costs 
taxpayers S2.103 per 
year. Effectively, Wal- 
Mart's low prices are 
made possible because 
of government subsidies. 
If Clinton becomes the 
next president, perhaps 
she can remedy these 
serious problems with 
her former employer's 
business practices. 

As first 
lady, Clinton 
earned 
valuable 
policymaking 
experience 
with her 

creation of 

the Clinton 

health care 
futures. An analysis of plan. In a speech in 1993, 
Clinton's trades in The President Bill Clinton 



and others where the 
decision or lack of one 
will significantly affect 
the child's future should 
not be made unilaterally 
by parents." 

Presumably, she 

would allow parents to 
make decisions that do 
not affect their children 
in any significant way. 

Clinton also has 
significant experience 
in the financial world. 
Between 1978 and 79, 
she made a 10,000 
percent profit on a S 1 .000 
investment in cattle 




^i^ 



"Clinton was alllowed to 

make large investments 

without having the money in 

her account to cover them." 



Wall Street journal said 
that her profits could 
make her "one of the 
luckiest amateur futures 
traders ever." 

According to Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange 
records, Clinton was 
allowed to make large 
investments without

system, saying that

than simply separating 
health insurance from 
employment, the first 



would have forced 
Americans to get 
their coverage from 
employer- funded

The plan received 
heavy __ 

criticism 
from both 
sides of the

Secretary 
of Health

Services. ^

How to Lose a Movie Set in Vegas 

Jin Sturgess talks about filming '21 ' with Jillian Berry, Senior Editor at The Tech 



ByJILLIANA.BERRY 

Courleni olUWIRE 



A few weeks ago, 1 sat 
down with ihe charm- 
* ing Jim Sturgess. the up 
and coming 26 year old 
British actor best know 
for his role as Jude in the 
Beades musical, "Across 
the Universe." In the up- 
coming film "21," (based 
on the book Bringing 
Doivn the House by Ben 
Mezrich) Mr. Sturgess 
plays Ben Campbell, an 
MIT student who uses 
his math acumen to ivin 
millions playing black- 
jack in Vegas. During 
our conversation, Mr. 
Sturgess talked about 
what it was like playing 
a character who is based 
on a real life MIT alum, 
Jeffrey Ma '94, filming in 
Las Vegas, and working 
with Kevin Spacey. Be- 
low is an excerpt: 

The Tech: Are you 
happy with the final re- 
sults of the film? 

Jim Sturgess: Yeah, 
definitely, i saw it a while 
ago. When you're mttk- 
ing the film you have no 
concept of how kind of 
visual it's going to look. 
Especially in the scenes 
when we're playing 
cards and all that kind 
of stuff. While we were 
shooting those scenes it 
was fairly kind of tedious 
kind of work; push- 
ing chips and flipping 
cards and all that kind 
of stuff. And then when 
you see the film you see 
how dramatic it looks. It 
was a shock to all of us, I 
think. The director [Rob- 
ert LuketicI kepi saying 
just trust me, trust me, 
it's going to look great 
... stuff that you kind of 
don't like doing as much. 
Actually you want to do 
the kind of big shouting 
scenes or alJ the meaty 
scenes or whatever. But 
we kind of stuck with it 
and I think it paid off. 

IT: Did you actually 
understand the math 
concepts in it? 

IS: Not at all. No. 
Couldn't gel my head 
round it at all, 1 mean we 
tried. On the weekends I 
had to play basic strategy 
blackjack, which Is pret- 
ty much all you can do 
unless .,. you'ri; a mathe- 



matical genius, which is 
why I think it's so specif- 
ic to these people's story. 
It's just not something 
everyday people can do. 

7T. What drew you to 
the movie? 

/S: The stor^', Jihink. I 
was kind of approached. 
I was shooting another 
film called "The Other 
Boleyn Girl" at the time, 
and I just got a call sajang 
that Robert Luketic, the 
director, wanted to meet 
me about this film that 
he's making .. I guess 
the idea of these kind of 
everyday people just go- 
ing against the system 
like that and coming out 
on top, which is always 
a nice take on life. It was 
just a feel good movie 
that was exciting to read 
as a script and ! think ex- 
citing to watch as a film. 
And I got to go to Vegas. 
And I got to wear de- 
signer suiis which 1 had 
never worn before. 

TT: Were you worried 
about doing an Ameri- 
can accent since you're 
British? 

JS: Yeah, definitely 
it's always a challenge. 
I enjoy a challenge that 
I've never done before. 
Anyone from England 
always thinks they can 
do an alright American 
accent. And you quickly 
learn once you're put 
in a room with a dialect 
coach that you can't ... I 
think 1 maybe 2 weeks to 
learn how to do it before 
we started shooting, so it 
was pretty rushed. I was 
nervous about it. 

TT, Did you play 
cards at all before? 

/S: No, not at all. Com- 
ing from England, it's not 
really — I mean we play 
poker for maybe match- 
sticks or spare change, 
or something like that ... 
We don't have a casino 
kind of culture as much 
as you guys do over here. 
And we certainly don't 
have an equivalent to Las 
Vegas. So that was part of 
the appeal really, to sort 
of learn this whole new 
world that I didn't know 
anything Eibout. 

TT. What was it like 
filming in Vegas with all 
the cra/.iness siill going 
on around you? 
JS: It was Insane. It was 
Ihe only time ever a film 
set seemed Inconspicu- 
ous, I remember I went 



to Ihe toilet in the casino 
and I remember I came 
back and I couldn't find 
the film set. It's like, it's in 
here somewhere. That's 
how crazy it is ... We were 
kind of sectioned off in 
areas of the casino. We 
couldn't shut doivn Ihe 
whole place. So of course 
the everyday life and the 
machines and all that 
were all going on whilst 
we were kind of play- 



JS: They were a big 
part of the whole pro- 
cess. They were on set a 
lot, we hung out a lot, we 
went out on the week- 
ends, we gambled with 
them a lot. 

77^ Did they win and 
you lose? 

JS: Pretty much. They 
woidd kind of shout out, 
Jim — they were just 
playing around — what's 
the count (shakes head 




ing, which helped the 
atmosphere of the film, 1 
think. Somebody would 
be doing a scene when 
somebody would belike, 
"Wlieel of Fortune," and 
we'd have to cut and wait 



and mouths 'no idea') ... 
So it was fun. And I think 
for them, they were just 
loving the fact that we 
were making this film 
about them. 

TT. This film is very 




for that to finish. 

TT. Did yim get a 
chance to speak with 
some of the original MIT 
team niomhers before or 
during shooting? 



dlffcreni from "Across 
the Universe," obviously, 
because you don't sing. 
Do you prefer being a 
singer over an actor or 
vise versa? 



JS: I don't have a 
preference, really. I've 
always done both. I've 
been sort of writing mu- 
sic, and playing music, 
and being in bands and 
stuff like that since I was 
about 15. And kind of 
acting — it's always just 
kind of been both. I've 
never had to separate 
the Uvo. I've never felt I 
had to separate the two. I 
still kind of feel like that. 
"Across the Universe" 
was a kind of dream job 
really because it was 
both molded into one, 
which then became a 
whole different difficult 
and complex thing; hav- 
ing to sing your kind of 
dialogue. Singing a song 
is one thing, singing 
what you're supposed to 
be thinking or saying is 
another. And then trying 
not to laugh is another. I 
was pleased I didn't have 
losing lin"2r'l. 

TT: Did you see any 
similarities between 
your character in the 
movie and yourself? 

JS: Yes, certainly. I 
think the fact that he 
needs a sort of push or 
kick start to think out- 
side the bo.t and not live 
in a kind of safe environ- 
ment, which is just so 
easy for all of us to do. 
And I think 1 could see 
a lot of myself in that, I 
think acting really is one 
— the only reason that 
Slops me from being like 
that. You're often kind of 
throivn into these dif- 
ficult situations which 
make you have to thirdc 
and behave different 
... Other than that, he's 
a very intellectual hu- 
man being, which 1 am 
not. IThe former] would 
probably be the main 
similarily that we share 
and 1 think most people 
share. 

TT. Now that you've 
done "Across the Uni- 
verse," "The Other 
Boleyn Girl," and "21." 
do you find that you're 
getting recognized 

more? 

JS: Not really, no. No, 
I wish it would (laughs), 
but no. No, I'm joking, 
"Across the Universe" 
was really the only film 
that's come out. Wliich 
was mainly more so 
here in America and I've 
been in Belfast shooting 
another film the whole 



time it's been out. 

TT What film was 
that that you were shoot- 
ing? 

JS: It's a film called 
"50 Dead Men Walking." 
It's about the troubles in 
Northern Ireland in the 
1980's. kind of the Cath- 
olics and the Protestants 
and all that stuff. 

TT. Not the feel good 
movie. 

JS: No. And no sing- 
ing in it either. So I've 
really been kind of living 
in that little bubble since 
the film's come out so I 
haven't kind of stepped 
out into the real world I 
guess. 

TT: What was it like 
working with Kevin 
Spacey? 

JS: It was cool. He's an 
amazing actor, a great 
guy, fun guy, and a very 
intense guy ... I've seen 
so many of his films and 
he's someone 1 certainly 
have been so aware of ... 
i remember he phoned 
me when I first got the 
part and I was back in 
London, and 1 just got 
a phone call and it was 
an anonj-mous number 
and I answered it, and 
said 'hello.' And he said, 
(in an intense American 
accent) 'Hello, this is 
Kevin Spacey.' But then 
we went out and we had 
lunch back in London 
because he lives in Lon- 
don. I went to see his 
play that he was doing at 
the Old Vic, land) then 
we just hung out then 
and it was cool. He just 
felt like a kind of friend. 

TT. Did you have a 
lot of free time when you 
were filming, especially 
in Vegas? 

JS: On the weekends 
we did. A lot of times we 
shot 6 day weeks and wo 
only got one day off. Ire- 
member we did a scene 
where on the weekend 
we'd all been out and 
partied and did all this 
crazystuffthatyoudoin 
Vegas, and then we woke 
up and pretty much the 
next of filmhig was act- 
ing what we had just 
done tlie night before. 
The line between real- 
ity and work was slowly 
blurring. Vegas it's easy 
to kind of get into trou- 
ble over there. Not trou- 
ble, but fun. which wc 
definitely did. 




R&amp;B Fans Rejoice: 'Day 26' is Here 



By DAN VANCE 

dannnceOf raiKhhepubNutians. ncl 



I'm not a huge fan of 
R&amp;B. But, I am a big fan 
of reality tv. But my love 
for that thing has cer- 
tainly peaked my inter- 
esi about the other one. 

Enier MTV's Making 
ihe Band and enter Day 
26. 

The product of hip- 
hop mogul RDiddy's 
mosi recent trip down 
reality tv street, Day 26, 
hits the bullscye wlttl 
cheir self-titled debut. 
In a time when oh-so 
many R&amp;B singers and 
groups fall short, Day 
26 is pretty successful. 
Thai is even more im- 
porlant in a lime that 90 
percent of realiiy-born 
musicians pretty much 
suck. 

The only real draw- 
back of the disc Is their 



most well known track 
"Exclusive (No Excus- 
es)." Born on Ihe first 
season of Making the 
Band 4 and used as a 
theme song for the show, 
it just really doesn't work 
as an upbeat club track. 
It is not a terrible track 
now, but in its infancy 
the track was a straight 
ballad and sounded re- 
ally good. Maybe I just 
got spoiled 
bylhal. ! 

Where 
"Exclusive" jgf 
fails 



on displaying all of the 
singers' unique voices. 

On this debut al- 
bum, I think thai "Since 
You've Been Gone" is by 
far the standard. The 
backing track is not 
overdone, helping the 
lyrics stay simple. The 
only problem that I see 
for this album is it really 
only showcases group 
members Willie Taylor 
and Brian 
. Andrews. 






How 
Ihc 



side of that 
is ihal the 
second verse 
docs the 
most justice 
for Andrews 
on the entire 



club hit, 
the group's 
debut sin- 
gle "Got 
Mc Going" 
hits all of 

the right places. The disc. His standout per- 
background track is formance mixed with 
full of bass and one of Ibeconslslcntvocalpat- 
the best of its kind that terns of Taylor keep this 
I have heard in quite track clean and vibrant, 
some time, "Got Me Go- Another solid track is 

ing" also does a nice job "Come In," which is yet 



another strong track for 
Taylor. It is a nice song to 
bring the ballad side of 
the album together with 
the upbeat club side of 
the album. Taylor (and 
the rest of the group) get 
diverse vocally on this 
track to keep up with 
the changing vibe of ihe 
music on the track. 

In addition to Ihe in- 
storc release, the group 
has many non-album 
songs available online 
that are worth listen- 
ing lo as well. Included 
in those is my personal 
favorite Day 26 track 
"No More," which is the 
most real and vivid song 
lyrically that I have head 
from then). 

All in all. Day 26 is 
worth checking out for 
all fans of music, wheth- 
er li&amp;B is your vibe or 
not.

IPFW Wrestling Club kicks off inaugural year, 
collaborates with IPFW Jujitsu team 

students have the 
chance to maintain 
peak physical condition 
and help develop IPFW 



By KATY ANDERSON 

An d ekn D 1 @ i p hv.cdu 



Dan Gable, a well- 
known American ama- 
teur wrestler, once said, 
"Once you've wrestled, 
everything else in life is 
easy." He said this be- 
cause of the strenuous 
physical and mental de- 
mands wrestling requires 
from its participants. 

"Every wrestler kno*vs 
that in high school they 
were in the best shape 
of their life," IPFW Wres- 
tling Treasurer Nathan 
Cheviron said, "Now they 
can keep in shape ai the 
collegiate level." 

IPFW students have die 
chance to perhaps rehve 
their high school memo- 
ries, gel into iheir peak 



physical condition, and 
help develop IPFW ath- 
letics and student life, as 
die IPFW Wresding Club 
is kicking of its inaugu- 
ral year on campus. The 
club was approved by the 
IPFW Student Govern- 
ment on Mar. 17. 

"Students have the 
opportunity to create a 
legacy and gel to be on 
the first IPFW Wresding 
Team," IPFW Wresding 
President Eric Rivera 
said. Rivera is an IPFW 
freshman who previous- 
ly wresUed at New Haven 
High School. 

The club is in conjunc- 
tion with the IPFWIujitsu 
Club. According to iPFW 
lujiisu president Jimmy 
Darabi, both wresding 
and jujitsu are ground 
oriented sports in which 
the primary goal of com- 
petitions is to get one's 




opponent to submit. 

According to Darabi, 
the main goal of activi- 
ties such as jujitsu and 
wrestling is self-defense 
and could be beneficiaJ 
to any individual, no 
matter what the extent is 
of an individual's athletic 
abilides. 

Every Tuesday and 
Thursday evening from 
7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., the 
IPFW lujilsu Club hosts 
open mat practices in 
the Gates Sports Center 
racqueiball court. Wres- 
tlers also come to this 
session to get into shape 



and to learn the basic 
techniques of defense. 
The only requirements of 
those wishing to partici- 
pate must be enrolled in 
six credit hours. 

Joining either of these 
two clubs is also free, 
which is possible be- 
cause of the sponsor- 
ship these teams have 
received from the Star 
Sponser Program. The 
Healdi Food Shoppe, 
The Bookmark, Indiana 



Spot 



Purdue Student Govern- 
ment Association, and 
the Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs. 

Although the wres- 
ding. team is currently 
recognized only as a club 
sport at IPFW, Rivera 
and Cheviron agree that 
there will not be a lack of 
competition or efforts of 
hard work from the team 
members. 

"We're going to be a 
serious and competi- 



tive team," Rivera said. 
The instructors for these 
clubs are also all world- 
accredited and ranked 
Jason Fox. 

For more informa- 
tion on either of these 
two clubs, one can visit

djng.com/ or http://

"Both organizations 
will enhance student 
life," Darabi said.

potentially lead to a full- 
time job."

Close election calls for 
voter registration drive 

Tight presidential race puts more focus 
and importance on voters in Indiana 



By KATY ANDERSON 

AndeVnOISipfwc.edu 



The presidential elec- 
tion is highly contended 
for among the Demo- 
cratic candidates, and 
such a tight race makes 
every vote more valuable 
than ever. 
OnApr. l,2,and3avot- 
er registration drive will 
be held in the basement 
of Kettler Hall around 
noontime. At this drive, 
students, faculty mem- 
bers, and other members 
of the IPFW community 
can register to vote right 
before the presidential 
primary nomination 



takes place on May 6. 

Because of its tate pri- 
mary date, Indiana nor- 
mally is not a state that 
is highly contended for 
among candidates. But 
with the close race be- 
tween Obama and Clin- 



ton, every vote clearly 
matters. 

If unable to register at 
IPFW, Indiana voter reg- 
istration forms can also 
be found online at www.

Track team opens strong 



The IPFW women's track and field 
team opened the outdoor portion of 
ihe season with a second place finish at 
the University of Cincinnati Early Bird 
Belays. 

Host Cincinnati look home first 
place ivith a score of 184. IPFW was a 
ways back at 76. Xavier placed third 
with 60 points, followed by Kent State 
and Northern Kentucky. 

Powered by first place finishes 
from Valerie Hardesty in the 3,000 
meter steeplechase and a 1-2 finish 
by Crystina and Crystal Martinez in 
ihe 5,000 meter run, tlie Mastodons 
finished only behind host Cincinnati. 

Hardestj' finished the steeplechase 
in a time of 11:46.56, nearly eight 
seconds better than the second place 
finisher. 

Crystina Martinez set a new school 
record, shattering the previous mark of 



17:30 set by Ashley Ritchey in 2007. by 
20-secondsinatimeof 17:10.15. Crystal 
Martinez also crushed that previous 
record ivitli a time of 17.17.08. 

"Thet\vin's races were phenomenal." 
Coach Mike Fruchey said. 

"it really is a testament lo their 
relentless work ethic and dedication.

weeks ago in a lime of 17:27 and the 
conference champion ran 17:24."

■ Rainy weather causes other postponements on baseball and 
Softball diamonds over past week

The baseball team only got two of 
their big four games played last week 
due to the inclement weather in the 
Midwest. Games in Indianapolis at 
Butler and in Ann Arbor, Michigan 
against the University of Michigan were 
postponed due lo rain. 

The game against Buder was made 
up on March 25, post-deadline. The 
game ai Michigan will be made up 
today, March 26 in Ann Arbor. 

In the games they did get in. IPFW 
hung close to the Indiana Hoosiers 
before falling 2-3 on Saturday and 2-4 
on Easier Sunday. 

On Saturday, Brandon Knowling 
pitched seveninning, giving upjusi one 
nin on six hits. Coming into the game 
2-0, he was not a factor in the loss, 

lared Davis put IPFW on the 
scoreboard first with a two-on, two-out 
hil in the third scoring Mark Garden. 
Indiana returned the run in the sixth 
and IPFW wenl back up on a Shaun 
VanDriessche RBI in the eighth. 

After tying the game in the ninth, 
the Hoosiers loaded up the bases and 
scored on a walk-off RBI from Andrew 
Means. 



Matt Anlos was the losing pitched 
for IPFW despite pitching just one- 
third of an inning. 

On Sunday, IPFW scored two 
late runs, but it was not enough to 
comeback. Indiana got three of their 
four runs in the fifth inning led off by a 
Means triple. After Means scored on a 
single, outfielder Kipp Schutz homered 
for Ihe Hoosiers to put them up 4-0. 
Cole Uebelhor gave up all four runs and 
picked up his third loss of the year. 

Coach Billy Gernon's team is 
scheduled to return to the field with 
a home opener against Goshen on 
Thursday as well as playing three games 
against visiting Long Island over the 
weekend pending weatlier conditions. 

The Softball team had all three of 
their games with conference foe South 
Dakota State postponed. 

The meetings would have been 
the home opening series for the 
Mastodons. They now are scheduled 
to open up home games on Friday and 
Saturday against Southern Utah. The 
girls have only played two games since 
their spring break trip, dropping both 
to Western Illinois. 

None of their four games that 
have been postponed have been 
rescheduled.

their way. That was brought to fruition urith a huge four game winning steak to 
end ihe month of lanuary. During that run, the women won by an average of just 
over 12 points/game. 

One of the major strengths for the team that they did not have in the past 
was diversity in rebounding. While they had spent some time relying to specific 
people in past seasons, the Mastodons were led in rebounds by nine different 
players in 2007-2008 from a 14 player roster. 

The top returning rebounder was Samantha Edwards, a sophomore. Edwards' 
4.B rebounds per contest was second on the team behind senior Natalie Roberts. 

The team will lost just three players in Levris-Carlisle, Roberts and luliane 
Hohnc, The three however made up 44 percent of the team's scoring and 34 
percent of their rebounding, 

Anoiher highlight for the women was when they became the first Summit 
League school to host a "Pink Out" to support breast cancer awareness.

!n the vast Madness that is 
college basketball in March, one 
ex-Masiodon used 2008 as another 
year to stand out. 

Let US all now reminisce and 
remember Pete Campbell, a guy 
we all once knew at 'Soup.' 

Hearing or reading his name 
on ESPN or in Sports illustrated 
has been really cool over the last 
year. But notliing was as good 
as watching three-pointer after 
ihree-pointer swish through the 
net in an opening round victory 
over South Alabama. 

Campbell, who spent two years 
at IPFV\'(onlyone playing) was the 
Independent Newcomer of the 
Year in 2005. He left shortly after 
the hiring of Dane Fife, citing that 




he wanted a guaranteed chance to 

play in the NCJ\A Tournament. 

And Pete made the right choice. 
He has been there twice in his uvo 
years as a Butler Bulldog, going to 
the Sweet 16 in 2007. 

He scored a big 26 points last 
Friday in a first round ivin. Though 
the Bulldogs lost on Sunday to 
Tennessee, his 8-for-lO shooting 
clinic from three-point range 
in round one was definitely his 
shining moment. 

In his five tournament games. 
Pete averaged 14 points/game. 
hitting a massive 21 three- pointers 
along the way. 

Kudos to Campbell for making 
a decision for the right reason 
and sticking to it despite losing a 
season of eligibility. 

As much as I have missed Pete 
Campbell at IPFW, his five game 
N(^A/\ Tournament career was 
well worth the move he made.

Rebuilt program will shine for Paul 



Emergence of Zuppe and strong interior play are steps in the 
right directions for IPFW, emerging second year head coach 



By DAN VANCE 

The IPFW team is inching closer and closer to 
making a big impact. 

After a strong final push as an Independent in 
2006-2007, the team did not seem to miss a beat in a 
semi-coaching transition that was taking place. 

And yes, they stumbled this past season as they 
transitioned again, this time to the Summit League. 
Their first year in conference play resulted in a .500 
conference record, but signs that this IPFW team will 
be a tough one to handle in years ahead. 

The similarities between the women and their 
male counterparts on campus are quite haunting. 
Like the men, this learn will lose their prime time 
player, Johrma Lewis -Carlisle, to graduation. 

Lewis- Carlisle was nothing short of amazing for 
the Mastodons, leading them in scoring for 26-of-30 
games including the first 20 games. She played in an 
average of 32.1-of-40 minutes per contest and scored 
more than 1 /4th of the team's points with 584. 

She capped off her big senior year by being named 
First Team All-Summit League and, as of press time, 
was ranked 16thin the nation in points per game. 

Frankly, Lewis -Carlisle is irreplaceable. 

However, as valuable as she was on the court, 
the things she did for this team will continue to be 
valuable in the future. It has been a few years since 
iPFW has had a face to attach to women's athletics. 
They now have one in lohnna Lewis -Carlisle. Her 




2007-2Q0B Summit League 

Though a five-seed in the 
conference tournament, IPFW 
placed seventh in Ihe Summit 
Leagie at 9-9. They did 
however hold wans over six 
confeience schools.

a huge addition for IPFW in 2008, hitting a team high 74 three-pointers. 



name and the things that she accomplished at IPFW 
will help the school and the program in so many ways 
over the next several years. 

But where she steps out. Jordan Zuppe will step In. 
Zuppe lead the team in scoring those other four game 
and shot over 40 percent from three-point range over 
her first season. Zuppe becomes the heir-apparent to 
help continue to build on what has been started. 

After starting the 2007-2008 campaign with a 
pair of tough losses, coach Chris Paul's team broke 



through with a 79-74 overtime win over Miami of 
Ohio and made the statement that they could be a 
very strong team. They struggled out of conference, 
going just 3-9 including two tough losses to Detroit. 

But still they were always on the cusp, looking like 
they could pounce if one or two more things went
