The decision by (lie National Council

NCATE is a nBlionslly recognised 
group that sets ilandards tor varinis 
teacher training programs tbiaughout 
the nation's colleges. The group is 
mode up ol educators Irom around the 
counlQ', so the accreditation Is actually 
a Judgement from the Institution's 



National 

CouncllolExceplional Children and the 
National Association ol Scbool Psy-

The NCATE accreditation of IPF- 
Vl's teacher training program expired 
in September of 1982, said Kenneth

Since IPFW has improved these 
condlUons based on the NCATE slon- 
dardi, accreditation looks hopeful. "We 
hope we did well," said Keller. He said 
"Thejuiy Is slillout, so we're waiting." 

The IPFW program is currently 
accredited by the North Central 
Association for Secondary College, 
which IS a ten-year accrodllatton. Also, 
the Deparlinenl of Public Inslnictian 
has accredited the IPFW program, so 
the program doesn't lack accreditation. 
However, Keller said thai the NCATE 
accreditation Is Important (or students

that go much smoother when you have

X.n 1886, following a shipwreck off the west coast of Africa, an infant 
child became part of a family of apes who raised and protected him. 

As he grew, he learned the laws of the jungle and eventually claimed 
the title. Lord of the Apes. 

"^t, years later, when he was returned to civilization, he would remain 

uncertain as to which laws he should obey. . . those of man. . . 

or those of the jungle. 

Now, the director of "Chariots of Fire" captures this epic adventure 

of a man caught between two different worlds.
