Every Rage Tin knows Ihe

On Ocl IS of Issl yen. 
MTV-com broke the slory with 
a single, chilling headline thai 
would leave Rigc Againsi die

has announced thai he has led

Ciling an inabilily lo

iighi, De La Rocha, the man 
who pul Rage*s message to 
words, decided to pack up and

"It (Rage Against die Machine) 
It no longer meeting the aspira- 
tions of all four of us collective-

in a sl3lemenl lo MTV com. 



'and from my perspective, has 
undermined our artistic and

Despite Rage's bieak-up. 
or at least die old Rage breaking

would nol picture Rage Against 
die Machine members listening 
lo, for example, and all of them 
have songs Rage sings on the 
new album. It is. as I said, very 
surprising. 

Another band whose 
music is featured is Cypress 
Hill, which was one of my 
favorite bands when I was a 
teenager Though I can't say I 
like il when Cypress Hill incor- 
porates rock into dieir music

one of my favonle Rage songs. 
It's slow, dark and does an

Likewise, in Rage's ^ver 
of Dylan's 'Maggie's Farm.' Dc

patriots take a slow song and 
put an edgy, up-tempo I

Anodier good song fea- 
lurcd on the album is Rage's 
cover of Springsteen's ballad 
"The Ghost of Tom Joad." I first 
heard diis song a few years ago 
featured on a 'battle of the 
songs'" on a local radio station. 
Ever since. Rage's cover of the 
Springsteen classic has become
