60 per cent of students 
think Union is needed 



Nearly 60 per cent of the student 
body feel that the Student Union is 
definitely needed on this campus, 
according to a survey made by Dick 



evaluation of the Student Union was 
taken last fall for a supervision class 
project and the results have been 
tabulated just recently. 

Fall classes were selected ran- 
domly trom official schedule lists and 
were asked to complete the survey in 
the presence of monitors. Faculty and 
staff opinion was canvassed by a 
random mailing of 350 questionnaires 
to the 450 population. 

After a three month testing period 
a total of 1.649 responses to the survey 
were collected which reflected a 23 
per cent samping of the entire 
campus population. 

The compilation of the results 
was conducted by using the campus 
computer center. 

The survey compares faculty and 
staff feeling with students opinions, 
academic loads, marital status, age, 
class standings, school affiliation, 
», and residency 73 per cent of 

ent of 



' the health services 
available on campus, compared to a 
71 per cent of the faculty and 87 per 
cent of thestalf Only 9 per cent of the 






faculty. The staff had taken 
advantage of the health service 
34 per cent responding positively. 

Students use the recreational 
facilities more than the others 
according to this evaluation. 83 per 
cent of the faculty, 75 per cent of the 
staff, and 64 per cent of the students 
never use the recreational facilities. 

54 per cent of part-time students 
never use the Union, while only 20 per 
cent of full-time students never use it 

21 per cent of the staff feel that 
the Arts and Crafts Room is definitely 
needed, compared to only 12 per cent 
of students and 10 per cent of faculty 
who do. 

48 per cent of the full-time 
students strongly agree that a 
recreational room is needed, and 36 
per cent of the part-time students feel 
this way. 

75 per cent of the part-time 
students never use the recreational 
area and 61 per cent of the full-time 
students never use it. 

In comparing the class standings, 
the survey found that freshmen use 
the building most, while the graduate 
students utitlize the building the least. 



IU-PU to graduate 
i honors students 

Indiana-Purdue will grant the 
first three honors degrees this year. 
Two will be in English and one in 
history. The three involved are 
Rebecca Stefoff and Carol Sowle in 
English and James Hansen in history. 

To become an honors graduate at 
I.U. one must have a grade point 
average of 3.30 in his major area, and 
not less than 3.25 overall. In addition, 
one must take nine hours of a special 
honors course. 

Most of the work is done outside of 
the regular classroom routine. The 
content of these courses is decided 
upon by the student and at least one 
member of the department involved. 

In the senior year, the honor 
candidate must take a three hour 
course in the fall devoted to research 
for a final paper. In the spring, one 
must write the 10,000 word paper and 
participate in a two hour session with 
at least three faculty members during 
which the candidate must defend not 
only the thesis of the paper, but also 
any questions on the area of study. 

There are four different types of 
honor degrees. They are highest 
honor, high honor, honor, and no 
honor. These categories are decided 
upon by the faculty involved in the 
oral defense section of the program. 

Miss Stetoff received bids from 
both I.U.-Bloomington and Purdue in 
West Lafayette for research and 
teaching assistantships. The I.U. plan 
would be for $2,500 and complete 
waiver of graduate school fees. P.U. 
is offering $3,200 and fee remission. 

Mrs. Sowle has been offered a 
fellowship and fee remission to the 
University of Pennsylvania. She is the 
first from this campus to be offered 
such an opportunity from an Ivy 
League school. 



Approximately 25 per cent of each 
class do not use the cafeteria. 

There was no significant differ- 
ence in attitudes among the various 
class standings about agreeing that 
the Union is definitely needed, except 
for graduate students. 33 per cent of 
the graduate students felt indifferent 
toward the Student Union. 

It was found that attitudes or use 
of the Union was the same regardless 
of which school the students attend. 
The data resulted in nearly identical 
percentages to the various questions. 

The section of the survey 
comparing differences between 
people from the Fort Wayne commu- 
nity and those who live outside the 
community showed that interest in 
the Union is slightly higher with Ft. 
Wayne residents. In responding about 
their use and attitudes concerning the 
music room, the recreational room, 
the TV room, the Arts and Crafts 
room, the Coat Room and the lockers, 
there were no significant differences. 

There were significant differ- 
ences in the attitudes of the male and 
female population. 52 per cent of the 
females use the cafeteria for dining 
and 46 per cent of the males use the 
cafeteria in that way Male respond- 
ents indicated that they use the 
cafeteria a little more for studying 
than do the females 

The 17-20 age group tends to use 
the Union building more than the 
other age groups. 

44 per cent of the single people 
agreed that the Union fulfilled their 
needs, compared to 45 per cent of the 
married. 40 per cent of the married 
people never use the Union, while 22 
per cent of the single people never use 

A general comments section was 
provided on the questionnaire to 
provide the students, faculty and staff 
with a means to express their 
constructive criticisms pertaining to 
the Student Union. 

In order to respond to the 
criticisms received, interviews were 
conducted with Rogert Manges, dean 
and director of Purdue University; 
John P Ulmer, associate dean for 
Student Services!; Joanne B. Lantz, 
assistant dean for Student Services 
Administration; Kenneth Keller; Don 
Haver, manager of ARA Food 
Services. 

The complaint received most was 
that it is too far to walk to the Union 
from the other buildings. The 
administrators interviewed remark- 
ed that the distance traveled between 
buildings on main campuses is much 
greater than the required on the Fort 
Wayne Campus. 

Some people expressed the idea 
that the building should be centrally 
located. Dean Lantz pointed out that 
the Union will be centrally located 
with the addition of more buildings 
planned for construction in the near 
future. 

Another frequently received cri- 
ticism is the need for signs, posters, 
and flyers informing the people of the 
university about what is available in 
the Union. Dean Lantz felt it would 
possibly be a good project for the 
Students' Government to print up a 
brochure about what is available in 
the Student Union. 

Many respondents also expressed 
a need for tennis courts and a 
gymnasium. Ulmer felt hopeful that

there is a committee exploring the 
possibility of a temporary bubble 
gymnasium to be put up until the 
construction of a permanent strtic- 

A few people felt small group 
study rooms were needed and some 
complaints were received about 
excessive noise outside the lounge 
areas. Dean Lantz said that the Union 
is not a study building per se. 

One person wrote a comment 
about a need for a larger couches or a 
separate bedroom area to which Dean 
Lantz indicated that the building is 
not a place to sleep. 

Some respondents stressed the 
need for more entertainment as well 
as a desire for more Friday afternoon 

Some people felt some amuse- 
ment games were needed and some 
expressed the need for more pin ball 
machines. 

A suggestion was made about the 
necessity lor a swimming pool and art 
exhibits in the Ballrooms. 

A few people felt that the building 
should be open on weekends. As such 
the building is open on weekends; 
however, many areas are closed 
because of little utilization which 
resulted in a cost of staffing the areas 
to be unprofitable. 

Other respondents felt that the 
price of pool is too high or that they 
should not have to pay for pool. Dean 
Lantz indicated that the situation will 
be checked and possibly that activity 
card holders may play free or with 
reduced rates. 

Some people felt that the area is 
too full of men loo much of the time, 
Ulmer said that il may be possible to 
get female instructors in the various 
areas to encourage more female 
participation. 

One person expressed the desire 
for a steam bath which at this point in 
time is nearly impossible. 

Only a few respondents expressed 
a desire for the Arts and Crafts room 
to be open on weekends and evenings. 
The Student Union Council deter- 
mines that the area should be under 
supervision while it is open but due to 
insufficient funds it may not be open 
on evenings and weekends. 

There are some comments 
expressing the desire for the Sales 
and Information Counter to sell 
magazines, cigarettes and pencils 
and other miscellaneous items. 
Because of University contracts with 
ARA, Canteen and Follett's Book 
Store, the Sales and Information 
Counter is limited in what it may sell. 

Dr. Lantz indicated that the 
Union Building was not designed as a 
study building and that classes were 
not to be held in the Union. However, 
special classes for informal or lecture

interviewed. Comments about bad 
food and some comments about bad 
coffee were received. He replied that 
"no matter what you do or how close 
to perfection you get, there will 
always be a small per cent who will 
complain." 

Fifteen people stated that they 
fell that the price was loo high. Haver 
stated the prices are determined by 
what he is charged for food and his 
overhead and the necessary profit. If 
profits rise above a certain point the 
money goes back to the University. 
Haver stated that the cafeteria prices 
are lower than prices charged by area 
restaurants for the same food. 
Requests for sandwich machines and 
ovens in Kettler and Neff Halls are 
the responsibility of Canteen, 



"I have mixed feelings ahoul 
leaving. I'm glad for the new 
challenge, but it's nnt a pleasure to 
leave good friends," Dan Motto, 
campus minister, expressed his 
feelings about his recently announced 
intention to leave Indiana-Purdue for 
a similar position at IndinnaUniver- 
sity-Purduc University at Indian- 
apolis HUPUI). 

Motto has been campus minister 
al Indiana-Purdue for 4Vi years. He 
has been sponsored by the Associated 
Churches. 

Inciting the things he has worked 
on and accomplished here, Motto said 
that his most important accomplish- 
ment was being a model of ministry to 
a commuter campus, When he was 
first appointed, I here was some doubt 



full-t 

Another important accomplish- 
ment was the work that he did on the 
Commuter Campus Study. He said. 
"The study brought forth awareness 
of particular problems of commuter 
students This resulted in some policy 
changes to help alleviate those 
problems.

newspaper Staffs. 

Motto was involved with the 
planning and eventual nrgam/al ion of 
the Child Care Center, He helped in a 
small way with the Center for the 
Study of the Person. 

He added, "There are a lot of 
other things that I've helped with. In 
all of those I mentioned there was a 
combination of other people's ideas 



and my ideas." 

"Here there have not been many 
things that I did by myself My job has 
been, within a certain perimeter, to 
help people to make things happen." 
The minister said, "The general idea 
of my new job is the same. My job 
depends on what is going on there."

On Friday, May 10, Saturday, 
May 11, and Sunday, May 12, 
Purdue-Indiana Theatre will present 
a series of student showcases. They 
will consist of three acting recifals by 
advanced acting students of the 
department and an original musical 
written and directed by the author. 

The students presenting acting 
recitals will be Jill Armstrong Ferry. 
Gerry Snyder, Connie Bartkiewicz 
and Jack Davis The original musical 
has been written and will be directed 
by Pam Jensen. 

The theme or Snyder and Miss 
Barkiewicz's recital. Illusion Hushes 
In, Where Minds Fear to Tread, deals 
with people who are unwilling to face 
their present existence. The recital 
will present people who avoid the 
present by looking to the past when 
like seemed more pleasant; people 
who will not see their lives happening 
right before them; and people whose 
love for someone prevents them from 
seeing that person as he or she really 
was. Illustrating this theme are 
scenes from The Rooming House by 
Karl Bromberg; Two Images by 
Peter Taylor; and Night by Harold 

Gerry Snyder is presently a 
sophomore at Indiana-purdue. At 
PIT. he has appeared in Canterbury 
Tales, Man of LaMancha, Mother

Cole, which has been presented 
throughout Indiana this year. He has 
also appeared in First Presbyterian 
Theatre productions of A Company of 
Wayward SainLs and The Apple Tree. 
He also designed and made costumes 
for their production of J.B. Working 
with the Summer Theatre Festival for 
two years, he was seen in Hello Dolly.

The Mousetrap presented by the 
Arens Theatre 

Jill Armstrong Ferry's recital is 
composed of four monologues which 
show insight to four different women 
and the way they fantasize in order to 
cope with their lives. The fantasies 
these women experience are in four 
different areas: the past, the present, 
the future and the "everlasting." 
Although their fantasies vary from 



one brought, on by religious feelings tu 
one of a deranged mind, they all 
demonstrate an inability in the minds 
of the characters to cope with the 
frustration and unhappiness in their

for Jacques Brel. Outside of PIT she 
has appeared in Cabaret, Thurber 
Carnival and Dark of the Moon. This 
summer she will appear in the role of

The third acting recital by Jack

Editorially 
Speaking 



FROM THE PECK OF THE TITANIC 



Follow our own rules 



The Student Supreme Court's decision to void the recent election has 
created quite a stir on campus. It certainly has taken our minds off 
unification for a while. 

It also has brought out into the open the very crucial issue of the role 
of the Student Body Constitution. The outcome of the present trouble 
should make it clear what that role is. 

One group, mostly Un-Party people, think that the Constitution 
should not be allowed to get into the way of what is '•right." In this case, 
"right" means letting the Un-Party lake office even though the election 
rules were broken, even though the Constitution clearly says that in such 
a case the Court must throw the election out. 

This group stresses the ethics of the situation. They say that Rusty 
Cane and all but one candidate were legitimate winners and should lake 
office The Constitution in this particular case is unethical and should not 
be enforced. 

The other opinion group consists mostly of people who have been 
around for a number o[ years. This group supports the Court's decision to 
apply the Constitution strictly to the situation. 

These Students' Government veterans feel that we must follow the 
rules we set for ourselves at all times, not only when it is convenient or 
"ethical." The Communicator supports this position. 

If a clause of the Constitution is poorly written and working other 
than it was intended to work, it must be amended through the proper 
channels and not by mob fiat. It must be amended only after much 
thought and study, not by emotion. 

The Un-Party senators have said that they intend to rewrite the 
Constitution as their first order of business. We urge strongly against 
this. 

The present Constitution is the result of five years' work by four 
different governments. The experience that has been written into it 
cannot be bettered by the emotions of a handful of neophytes. 

Rewriting a Constitution which is less than a year old will cause 
many more problems than it will solve. We hope the more mature 
Un-Party officials will take this into account 



Career-oriented counseling 



Rusty Cane, the maybe student hmly president -elect, lias said that bis 
administration, if it does take office, will give high priority to the study of 
the counseling problems that exist on campus. 

Cane, along with this newspaper and many others, is not happy with 
the counseling system that we have. Too many students are finding out 
too late that they have done the wrong thing academically. 

There are two functions of the counseling system. The first is 
academic advising, in which students in a particular major are told what 
courses they must take to complete the program. 

Academic advising is a verbal communication of the information that 
is printed in the academic bulletin Anyone who has read a bulletin will 
attest to the fact that it is difficult to read. Also, the bulletin must leave 
out much information because of space constraints. 

Academic advising should begin once a student has determined what 
program he wishes to enroll in Before he makes this decision, he needs 
the second form of counseling. 

Students need a better understanding of career opportunities and the 
job market. They need to know what it is that they are suited for or have 
an interest in. They also need to know their chances of finding a job. 

The Counseling and Academic Development Division exists to aid the 
student in this regard. The division, unfortunately, has not developed its 
full potential because of organizational problems that can plague any new 
program. 

Time will solve many of these problems for CADD. Then it will be 
possible to realize the potential that exists in the division and in the people 
who staff it. 

Although CADD bears the brunt of much criticism from the faculty, it 
is attempting to meet a need that is not being met anywhere else. And this 
is what Rusty Cane and others are talking about. 

IN BLACK AND WHITE 



Un-Party 'harumps' student court 



In last Thursday's Communica- 
tor, there appeared an article by Tim 
Ducey that announced the Student 
Supreme Court's action against the 
results of the general elections. To 
refresh everyone's memory, these 
writers will attempt to reconstruct 
l he events that occurred on May first; 
the day in which the Court declared 
that the Student Body elections were 
invalid. To many, this day has been 
referred to as the "Wednesday Night 
Massacre" or an UNfortuunle day in 
which the Un-Partv was UNable to 
UNderstand or UNdermine the ACT- 
ions of the Supreme Court. 

The actual drama began several 
weeks ago, when, Stan Jones 
announced that, because of flagrant 
iregularilies during the election, he 
was placing an injunction on the 
newly elected Students' Government. 
During the following weeks, Jones led 
the Supreme Court through a 
thorough investigation of the alleged 
mis-handling of the elections. As a 
result, the court found that the 
Un-Party had run an Indiana student 
for a Purdue senatorial post. This 
fact, compounded with several other 
irregularities, caused the Supreme 
Court to invalidate the election 
results. These findings, announced 
during the day of May first, started an 
avalanche of demands calling for an 
open meeting with the Supreme Court 
that night. It was at this point the 
massacre began to shake the 
hallowed halls of the Student 
Government offices. 

The special meeting was ar- 
ranged to begin at 9:00 pin. in the 
Student Union. These writers, being 
the representatives of the ACT party, 
felt obligated to attend. The meeting 
began on a solemn note as the 
Supreme Court Chief Justice, Stan 
Jones, entered a conference room 
that was packed with assorted 
Un-Party officials. The following is an 
unofficial transcript of the sessions 
beginning (expletives deleted): 

JONES: I suppose that you 
are all wondering why I called you 
here this evening...! assorted laughter 
and jeers) Seriously, I am here to

Each party is now obligated to 
present an oral argument before the 
court. It has been rumored that Braun 
will act as the official representative 
of the Un-Party. However, it is 
questionable if Charlie Braun, or even 
Perry Mason, can change the opinion 
of this Court. 

After this meeting, these writers 
spent the next day getting other 
people's impressions of the :

otherwise But it is questionable if it's 
in the best interest of the student 
body, the very people they are 
supposedly representing." 

Another Government official re- 
sponded, "Students' Government has 
again proved that although it may at 
times be unable to represent the 



students, it has never been unable to 
amuse itself, and thereby, hopefully, 
amusing the entire student body." 

Finally, when these columnists 
asked Charles Pratt, the defeated 
presidential candidate, what he felt 
about the Court's decision, he 
responded, "terrific, just terrific." 
When pressed for further comment, 
Pratt snapped that he wasn't about to 
be quoted further in such an asinine 
column. To which these columnists 
replied, "Terrific, just terrific." 

And that's the way it was,

was off to a serious and intelligent

jeer at the court. Amid all the 
mayhem three rational voices were 
heard. It is these writer's opinions 
that, in addition to Jones, two others 
were sincerely trying to solve the 
problem before them. They were 
Charlie Braun, the "attorney" for the 
Un-Party, and Rusty Cane. 

Thanks to a combined effort by 
Charlie Braun, Rusty Cane and Stan

a disastrous ending. Braun found that

By MAC HAMILTON 

Just in time for us to begin 
writing our last column for the year, it 
was announced that higher education 
will once again receive over the next 
two vears what is left at the very 
bottom of the budget. We felt that 
some money saving suggestions were 
in store, so we made them. 

It is our feeling that it is 
somewhat useless for the presidents 
of the two schools to be ferried all 
over creation on University -owned 
jets. If they would just quit trying to 
imitate "The President," there would 
be untold savings for us in pilot pay, 
gas, etc. "Hold down the junkets, hold 
down tuition" should be the battle cry 
for the next few years. 

Added to the personal savings is 
another fringe benefit. The planes are 
probably worth a million or two a 
piece, which would almost buy a fifth 
of building "D." 

Another place to practice auster- 
ity over the next biennium would be in 
the area of police protection. 

Why should the chief of Safety 
and Security, Ear) Warnock, have 
more fringe benefits than his men? 
We feel that he should have the second 
bullet taken away and carry only one 
like the rest of his men. An even 
better suggestion from our viewpoint 
would be to give the bullet to 
whomever is out on a share and share 
alike principle. 

Another savings from our beloved 
' SS would be to make the fellows walk 
the rounds when they are giving out 
tickets. 

It is their patriotic duty to help us 
conserve gasoline as our beloved 
president has asked us to do. It is 
estimated that savings on gas and oil 
would probably amount to a yearly 
savings equal to athe other four fifths 
of a new building.

A fantastic side benefit would be 
putting our cops into peak physical 
condition. A better shape would help 
them in their never ending battle and 
keep our A-lots free from the blue 
menace of the B sticker! 

We also would like to suggest to 
the SS that they ration Officer 
Maroney. Untold millions of the green 
could be saved each year in pens, ink 
and paper if Officer M were limited to 
giving out only 500 tickets a day. 

As a sidelight, we found out that 
M was responsible for the death of 
80,000 trees last year alone. 

Another good idea for making 
money would be to buy Canterbury 
Green and use it as a dorm. Fees from 
the Golf course, swimming pool and 
the other recreational activities 
would be a major factor in easing the 
money crunch. In additon, students 
would flock to this campus as the only 
one offering free golf, tennis and 



n't IU-PU 



not forget about the meeting house 
for Union Board dances and the like. 

Another good bet from our point 
of view would be to follow the lead of 
Fort Wayne in certain areas. Perhaps 
the two U's could talk I&amp;M into, 
leasing our electrical generating 
facilities for a few mil a year. If City 
Light can do i 
Light? 

Do not get us wrong, however; the 
administration is doing some great 
things in the area of saving money. 
The immediate example that comes-. 
to mind is the Xerox machine. There,! 
is only one, shared by both 
administrative staffs, sitting idle 85 
per cent of the time. 

We did save the best idea for last. 

Unify this campus, throw half a., 
dozen administrators out of jobs, and 
save the schools enough money so 
they won't have to rip us off next y 




University should fund center 



To the Editor : 

I wish to reply to the editorial in 
the Communicator of May 2, 1974 
regarding day care inflation. I feel 
that the editors have done a great 
diservice to the quality of care at the 
IU-PU Child Care Center. 

As a parent, and a full time 
student at IU-PU, I am very happy 
ih.U such .i laeihtv r\isls I am also in 
favor of keeping the high educational 
level that the center now offers. It is 
not simply a baby sitting service. The 
IU-PU community needs and has in 
the C.C.C. a child care facility run by 
people trained in childhood education. 

The following is a quote from the 
newsletter of the IU-PU Child Care 
Center Vol. 1, number 3 and it shows 
the type of care that the children get 
when professional people are used to 
staff the center. 

"We've tried to emphasize verbal 
expression, manipulation, coordina- 
tion, visual discrimination, creativ- 
ity, social interaction and, most 
importantly, positive self-concepts." 

There are plenty of baby sitters in 
Fort Wayne, but there is no place 
where high quality care is offered for 
such a low price. 

To imply as your editorial did that 
this means that I feel that parents are 
not "qualified" to care for children is 
false and infuriating. I consider 
myself competent and "qualified" to 
care for children, but the C.C.C. often 
handles a dozen children in one room 
in one time period. Taking into 
consideration the fact that team- 
teaching techniques are used, that is 
still too many children for inexper- 
ienced and untrained people to 
handle 

Furthermore, paid staff mem- 
bers work extended, continuous hours 
whereas co-op parents would be 
coming and going throughout the day. 
This would lead to discontinuity in the 
program and cause the small center 
to be more hectic than it already is. 

I suggest that the university 
sider the following: 



oriented C.C.C or a "baby sitting 

2. That the incoming Student 
Government who had on their 
platform keeping the child care 
center, rebudget the $1200 that the old 
Student Government cut. 

3. That the office of Students' 
Services, and the Student Govern- 
ment evaluate the way in which the 
C.C.C. budget has been spent. 

4. That the rules pertaining 



i hours of child t 
ridpi'My and uniformly enforced. 
5. That the use of evening 



Thursday and the evening hours 
have a very low registration 

6. That the university consider 
full funding of the C.C.C. making it 
free to faculty, staff and students. 

These are only a few things that 
could be tried. I feel that it is 
extremely important to

Un-Party wants 
chance at job 

To the Editor: 

Since the Communicator's arti- 
cles were mainly downgrading to the 
Un-Party, I feel that I should put my 
two cents worth in this paper. Points 
of interest that concern me will be a 



First, I would like ti

Board had planned on having five 
bands play Saturday, granted. We

We had a $4,000 expected income 
which was taken away without our 
knowledge after we had the contracts 
for Cactus and Spirit. We had to 
cancel them because of this. 

As far as advertising, we had 3 
bands, Ethos, Bull Angus, and REO 
Speedwagon announced on the radio.

step in the right direction for this 
school, though. 

Our platform was cut down a" 



the end of each article it said, 
O.K. Rusty Cane and the Un-Party, 
you do it!" Well, we've been 



thrown out of Student Government 
before we've ever got in so how in the 
hell are we suppose to do anything. 
I read some articles about how 
great the ABC party was. Since they 
control the government, convoca- 
tions, student budget, Day Care 
Center and the Supreme Court, I 
should hope they can get something 
done. They did get the Day Care 
Center started and now have cut their 
budget so they can't operate. That's 



real clas:

down before we've had a chance 
anything except win the election in 
which we've been thrown out. All I 
can say is the Un-Party will do all 
of it over again and work hard to help 
any student I hope this sheds a new 
light on the subject.
