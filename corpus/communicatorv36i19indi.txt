Challenges 
face getting 
aid overseas 



Inside Thailand, very close 
to the border with Burma, there 
sits a clinic in the jungle. This 
clinic is staffed with volun- 
teers and the occasional U.S. 
physician and is supplied by 
donations. This clinic gives the 
residents access to reproduc- 
tive health care, family plan- 
ning, in-and-out patient work, 
. disease pre- 



of supplies from Indiana i 

This supply project was the 
brainchild of IPFW's own Kyaw 
Soe, a Burmese civil rights Fight- 
er and teacher for the Burmese 
population here in Fort Wayne. 
Kyaw Sue thought of the idea 
when asked by IRC Program 
Director Sarah Younker- 
Koeppel for a community ser- 
vice project. Wanting to help 
out his homeland and people, 
Soe immediately suggested the 
Mae Tao Clinic. Soe is the lead- 
er of the IPFW branch of the 
IRC, or Indiana Reading Corps, 
a branch of the AmeriCorps. 
Indiana has 16 such groups 
scattered across campuses, ele- 
mentary schools, and commu- 
nity- and faith-based organiza- 
tions. These 16 groups were 
able to raise supplies for the 
clinic from 13 different Indiana 
communities, including Fort 
Wayne and IPFW. 

Challenges still face the 
group as they now face the tre- 
mendous cost of shipping the

IPFW Students and Alumni take 10th 
Annual ttip to lobby for funding for 
IPFW. The fund raising trip was the first 
time IPFW has gone to the Statehouse 
alone.

Indianapolis during the legislative ; 
lnhli\ nurihcasiern Indian,! lawmakers on behalf 
of IPFW The goal was to raise $30 million in 
.iddiiinti.il funding lor the new Student Service 
i (uii[)k'\ and to increase the status and prestige 
Of IPFW as an economic and cultural center of 
nnrilieast Indiana. 

Once the group arrived at the Indiana 
Statehouse, Kevin Green, the Vice President ol 
Purdue State Relations, met the group. This 
was II'i : W's lirsi lime coining without Purdue 
University or Indiana University main-campus 
representatives, so Mr. Green took some time 
explaining the protocol and rules of engaging 
the state senators and representatives. An 
informational meeting followed about various 
education bills being voted on, with a strong 
focus on the various things being considered lor 
Indiana colleges. Mr. dreed seemed unaware thai 
ll'RV was here to further a personal agenda, anil 
spoke IngliK of various initiatives on the table lor 
Lafayette, including a plan to give 
e $10 million for various renovations. IPFW 
01 mentioned in this plan.

the popcorn maker, the teenage 
ticket seller and the blue-collar 
set designer. This "everyman 
suffers" information campaign 
prevents the MPAA as being 
viewed as greedy and malicious 
by the public at large, a viewpoint 
the RIAA was stuck with. Even 
today, the MPAA's only comment 
on piracy is how it hurts these 
simple folk, and makes no 
mention of the ultra-rich stars, 
producers or directors. 

However, the MPAA has had 
its share of lawsuits as well. The 
most recent was on Feb. 1. with 
the indictment of 19 people on 
15 counts of plans to distribute 
brand-new movie titles. Unlike 
the RIAA, the MPAA has made 
sure that the federal government 
issues these indictments and 
that it is a purely criminal 
proceeding on the grounds of 
copyright infringement and

The federal government, 

however, has shown little increase 
in anti-piracy activity with such 

violent crime, the war on drugs, 
the war on porn and illegal 
immigration consuming the vast 
majority of its resources. For 
the moment, the pirates seem to 
lie enjoying a victory, operating 



Success was varied. 

The IPFW lobbyists began to 
mingle into the busy floors of 
the Statehouse trying to sell the 
agenda outlined in pamphlets 
by the event organizers, and 
they were not alone. Among 
the throng, signs showing 
disapproval at the Bill 1383 
seemed most numerous. They 
were happy to speak out on HR 
1383. an anti-immigration bill 
that would prevent any illegal 
alien from attending college in 
Indiana at any point even if they 
graduated from an Indiana high 
school. According to the activist 
against HR 1383 and acting on 
the behalf of the ACLU, numbers 
get the most attention and just 
being persistent gets the best 
results.

In the fifth, the 49crs capitalized on

to last for the Mastodons who saw the 
high-ranked 49ers battle back strong. 

"They did make adjustments to what 
we were doing to slow us down and one 
of them was to put in a new opposite 
and he played really well against us 
especially in games three and four," 
noted Macias. 

With IPFW shutting down Tarr, Long 
Beach State went to that second option 
in the last three games in opposite hitler 
Norm Hutton. 

Hutton had 10 kills in game three, 
helping Long Beach begin to claw back 

A group of IPFW attack errors and 
three kills from Tarr helped the 49ers 
jump out to an 11-1 lead in game three. 
The 49ers never looked back in evening 



Macias again led IPFW with 23 kills. 
The sophomore transfer also had nine 
digs, two service aces and a hitting 
percentage of .421. 

A kill by Matt Fritz put Juniata up 
4-2 in the opening game, but after a kill 
by Stewart evened things up at 4-4, the 
M.isiudons nevei looked back. 

Stewart led IPFW on the block with a 
solo block and live block assists. Senior 
Serdar Sikca had five block assists 
while setter Colin Lundeen also helped 
in shutting down the Eagles with four 
assists and one solo block. 

"It was pretty big because we knew 
we had to win a match and they are a 
good team so it was uplifting to just go 
out and beat them in three," Macias 

In the weekend split, Macias totaled 
up 50 kills with over 20 each match. 
However, no other Mastodon was able 
to reach double digits in either match in 
kills. The next best performance came 
from Stewart who had nine against 
Long Beach State. That factor however, 
does not worry Macias as the season 
progresses. 

"It doesn't really concern me because 
it is just the new offense that we have 
been running," he noted. "The other 
hitters may not be getting as many kills 
but they are more effective, hitting at a 
higher percentage." 

IPFW will now travel to Quincy as 
they continue their conference season

Grimm balances plenty 

■ A full-time classroom load and part-time job keeps this IPFW thrower busy 



ByAmieSarka 

Loree Grimm's day starts at 4 a.m. to get 
ready for work, which she has to be at by 5 
a.m. to open. Her day ends at 1 1 p.m. 

She works 22 to 28 hours a week on 
top of 17 credit hours. Oh yeah, she also 
participates in IPFW women's track and 
field as a thrower. 

She gets things done through time 
management. 

"I'm really good at it," Grimm said. 

She is able to manage her time by 
not getting a lot of sleep. She is good at 
managing her time because she had to 
learn how to do it her freshman year of high 
school. Grimm was involved in volleyball, 
basketball, track, show choir, marching 
band, concert choir and concert band that 
year. That is how she became good while 
maintaining a "B" average. 

Long-time friend and former IPFW men's 
track and field student- athlete Brandon 
Reichert described Grimm in one word.

reliable and throws consistently. There is 
no need to worry about bad performances 
with Grimm. 

Even though breaking her indoor record 
was one of her goals this season, Grimm 
would like to accomplish it again. In her 
outdoor season, she would like to break 
her shot put record as well. She wants to 
be able to hit her personal goals since this 
is her last year on the team because she 
will be student teaching and graduate in 
May 2007. 

If Grimm breaks her outdoor record, she 
has ahigh chance of competing individually 
at the regional meet. 

"I guess |the regional meetl is a goal, but 
it's a siit. goal." stated Grimm. 

Grimm's coach is not at practice when 
Grimm can be there, at 4:30, since the 
coach works 60 hours a week at Spiece. She

it so long. My body just knows." 

This also comes from training at a young 
age. Grimm started throwing with her older 
sister when she was in the sixth grade. She 
started competing in the seventh grade at 
her middle school where her sister was her 

One thing that helps Grimm do so well 
in the ring ts the years of training that she 
had. It also comes from the moral support

Exxon Mobil fleecing America 



Exxon Mobil recently 

announced their yearly profits 
- an astounding S36 billion. 
This is more than a 40 percent 
jump from the profits they made 
last year Exxon Mobil has even 
risen above Wal-Mart, making 
the oil company's income the 
largest in the nation. 

Companies can make profits 
h\ charging extra, that is the 
point of existing as a company. 
Hm in ,uies : Rila and Katrina 
made oil and naiural gas prices 
rise, we understand that. But 
gas prices were obviously set too 
high in order for Exxon to receive 
such a large profit. How is it 
legal for oil companies to make 
such overwhelming earnings 
while Americans struggle to 
meet prices at the pumps? 

Sometimes Americans don't 
hi'lfi themselves when it comes 



to paying at the pump. It costs a 
lot more to fill up an SUV than a 
car. Americans are dependent, 
basically addicted to fuel and oil 
companies are taking advantage 
of that. 

Sierraclub.org states that 
Exxon will not pay the S4 billion 
in damages it owes because of 
the Exxon Valdez oil spill back 
in 1989. The case is stuck 
somewhere in a Court of Appeals 
with no, trial date set. With such 
a large profit they can pay off 
that bill and still have plenty left 

Why isn't something being 
done to regulate what these 
companies legally can and 
cannot do? Last fall an energy 
bill was passed by Congress 
that gave more than S2 billion 
in tax breaks for oil and gas 
companies. This is in addition 



to the tax breaks they .ue already 
receiving. The government is 
just putting money in these 
companie's pockets. 

Finally, President Bush 
proposed, in the 2007 budget, 
to cut a S50 million per-year 
research and development 
program. Hopefully now it will 
be approved. Oil companies 
need to bring oil and gas prices 

There is no need for a 

company to have a yearly 40 
percent increase in profits. 
Exxon Mobil could have given 
consumers a slight break at the 
pump, a few cents here and a 
few cents there, and they still 
would have seen a large increase 
in profits on their end.

In order to get away with this stuff, the

The word "lobbying" appears

with no elaboration, to have "an 
excellent lobbying trip." 

The message tells students 



itself. 

It does promise that

available the day of the trip- 
two days after the cancellation 
deadline. 

I cancelled immediately.

Grammy nominated album rereleased with a new twist 



Album Review 



This week Trisha Yearwood 
re-released her latest Grammy 
nominaled CD, Jasper County, 
to include ihe single "Love 
Will Always Win', a duel with 
her iconic husband, Garth 
Brooks. He, too, rc-rcleascd his 
'Lost Sessions' CD to include 
additional tracks along with the 



Jasper County op- 
Who Invented The Wr

than it should be for a song 
about loss. It's either about a 
car crash or an over-the-road 

For some true honky-tonk 
Pistol offers a classic country 



The popularity that Georgia 
Rain saw on the country charts 
this past fall can surely be made 



ever get by me. Maybe 1 
Id undo ,ill the hurt you've 
n through... Try me, try me. 



Try Me offers the young and 
old looking for love a song of 
hope. The lyrics are a Valentine 
in of themselves to that 



different, Then maybe that's 

Georgia Rain, however, will 
be the one song anyone in the 
music industry will remember 
on this album. With the 
background vocals provided 



by]

t for v, 









'ork. 



for a night. 

Recently Yearwood release 
her single Trying' To Love You. 
The slow love song will most 
likely be a crossover hit with 
Adult Contemporary stations. 



u say ihe right words to. 

"You don't think you can 
ind true love again... won't 
ou try me? There's somebody 



theme song about those who 
are Too short, too tall; Flower 
against the wall... The last one 
chosen to play. Too smart, too 
dumb, Too strange a place to 
be from... Same shoes every 
day. With all these ways to be 



love revisited. 



As I finish putting the 
songs on my MP3 player I am 
wondering in what kind of 
mood I'm going to have to be 
in to listen to Jasper County. 



Closing my eyes I can see myself 
walking barefoot in the dewy 
grass making wishes upon the 
stars that wink from above. 
There are definitely days 1 

get away from it all. I'll pop 
on the AJanis Morissette or 
fim Morrison depending i 



life I'll try take my MI'3 player

thrown together again — only 

this time it's business. Though 

she's incredibly reluctant, she's 

attracted to his work and, let's be honest, him. As he's working, she finds herself 

more and more interested in him as a man. She allows herself to lower her guard; 

step out from her iron-clad mold. Sadly, .ill tomes to screeching halt when Kenya 

can't face how her parents (mainly her mother) will view their relationship. The

Album Review 






WhenThehilU Down released their debut full 
length album ■'Don't t.et Lost in ihe Movement' 
at the end of 2005. they had only a cult-following 
in most areas of the country. 

A couple of months later, the fans have not 
got lost m the movement ol Ihe Folly Down, in 
fact they have stayed avid followers of the hand 
thanks to a stellar debut. 

The disc opens with the hard hitting beats and 
guitar chords of "Cost of Comfort,.' a song thai 
also blends melodic modern-punk in with lyrics 
that are a rare breed of genius. 

In today's music scene, most emotionally 
charged songs are either A) recycled garbage 
lyrics or B) soft inslnimentally, lacking an\ edge 
whatsoever Cost ol Condon' meets neither of 
those pre-concieved emotional points. Instead. 
it start the disc off on a very high note, perhaps 
as the best song Hut die oilier i racks don't miss 
much themselves. 

I m mediatly on the next track "Decent, 
Rebellion, and All Around Hell raising, the hand 



lyrical and vocal .ibilin and how rhey mix it with 

Midway through the album on "Plug in the 
l-.limiiuior." the vocals take a on a softer, yet 
si i II eh raged nielodicness. This is one of the few 
tracks where I he Hilly Down slow up the vocals

Mastodons 
split at Dakotas 



By Nick West

The IPFW men's basketball 
team headed to the upper- 
Midwest this past weekend 
to lake on North Dakota State 
Bfson und South Dakota State 
lackrabbils. 

What they got 



lead the 
Bison over the Mastodons. Brad 
Pompey had 20 and Quiniln 
Carouthers 18 in the loss. 

Two days later, IPFW got some 
solid production from Zeljko 



State (71-59) 
defeated in every statistical 
category and clamped down the 
defense on South Dakota State 

rouie to a 58-38 victory. 

Perhaps the most curious 

tistic was that IPFW never 
led against the Bison, but never 
trailed against the lackrabbits. 

They are tough," IPFW 
coach Dane Fife said about the 
Bison in an interview before the 
team hit the road for the games. 
"They are a tough squad. Four of 
their five starters are in double- 
figures. And obviously, they beat 
Wisconsin so they are capable of 
beating anyone." 

lough they were. 

North Dakota State out- 
rebounded (38-26), out-shot 
(49.2%-44.9%), out-passed (16 
assists to eight) and forced the 
Mastodons into 14 turnovers to 
their nine in the Feb. 4 contest. 

The Bison 113-10) are no fluke 
of a team. When Wisconsin was 
ranked No. 15 in the country, 
they headed into the Kohl Center 
- where the Badgers were 68-4 in 
their last 72 games - and puljed a 



liesi is day-to-day. 

The Mastodons forced the 
lackrabbits into 20 turnovers 
and a dismal 36.4 shooting 
percentage. The lackrabbits 
were also 0-of-12 from behind -

Losing streak slides to 11 
straight games under Paul 



MVP?: IPFW junior guard Ashley Johnson has had an outstanding 
season, averaging 13 points and 3.2 assists per game, And at 5-foot- 
8, she is the team's leading rebounder with 5.9 per contest. In IPFW 
losses to Texas Pan-American and Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi on Feb. 
4 and Feb. 6, Johnson scored 37 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and 
dished out six assists. Johnson will lead the Mastodons to one final 
road game of 2005-06 against Purdue on Thursday, Feb. 9 before 
IPFW finishes out its season with six straight home games.
