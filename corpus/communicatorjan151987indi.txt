Sludents waiting for IPFW to cancel 
classes because of snow may bewailing 
quite a long time. 

1 The overriding philosophy is that we 
will be open," John Carnaghi, vice 
chancellor of financial affairs, said 
Tuesday. 

Carnaghi said university officials 
consider two main factors in deciding 
whether to cancel school because of 
snow "The first thing," Carnaghi said, 
"is, have we the resources in men and 
machinery to clear the lots?" Carnaghi 
said being a commuter campus, IPFW 



parking lots have to be cleared for 
students, regardless of the condition of 
city streets. The second factor officials 
consider, Carnaghi said, is the situation 
in the city. For example, he said, if a 
snow emergency is declared for Fort 
Wayne, the university has to abide by 
that. The only exception Carnaghi could 
think of, is for instance if an emergency 
were called during a week such as final 
examinations week, something that 
almost cannot be cancelled. 

The decision to cancel classes is 
really a judgement call losee if city and 
campus streets are passable, Judy 
Clinton, executive director o( univer- 
sity relations, said, "We have lo decide 



early in the morning, between 3 a.m. 
and 6 a.m., then we gel it out to the 
public." 

Clinton said the first source students 
should go to find out if there has been a 
cancellation or not is cable Channel 23. 

She said the university also notifies 
area radio stations and the four 
television stations. The radio stations 
that should have Ihe information, she 
said are WOWO, WMEE, WQHK, 
WEZV, WFWQ, WXKE, WGL, KOOL 
Cable, WBNI, WBCL and WAJI. A last 
source for the information, she said, 
should be the IPFW switchboard, 
although that number will have taped 
messages if there are any class can- 



cellations. 

Carnaghi and Clinton both urged that 
any faculty and students who live in the 
outlying counties or in rural Allen 
Counly lo use their best judgement in 
deciding to come to work or school. 

Clinton also said that if 'a student 
lives in a rural area and knows his or 
her streets or roads are' usually nol 
clear during a snow storm to discuss 
the potential of a problem with his or 
her instructor now — before a 

Students should also know, Clinton 
said, that if an emergency arises, they 
should call the department of police and 
safety at 481-6827. 



Foundation approves 
land lease to Coliseum 

The Indiana-Purdue Foundation at Fori Wayne and the Allen County Memorial 
Coliseum have entered into an agreement so the Coliseum may install a parking lot 
lor vendors and exhibitors. 

Ihe parking lot, 200 feet by 200 feet, to be located between the American Red 
Cross property and St. Joseph River, will be used only by lessees of the Coliseum, 
and not for paid public parking. The land is part of a tract leased by the I-P 
Foundation from Allen Counly, 

By the agreement, the Coliseum will maintain the property and mow the area 
surrounding it. provide insurance coverages in which the I-P Foundation is named 
as co-insured, and allow IPFW to store vehicles, such as snow removal equipment 
and trucks, on the lot when it would otherwise be empty. 

If the Foundation needs the property for Campus use at some point, the Coliseum 
also agrees to remove all improvements made. 

John R. Carnaghi, vice chancellor (or financial affairs, said the university 
stages ils commencements in the Coliseum and next summer, will sponsor the 
Muddy Rivers Auto Show on campus lo benefit athletic scholarships.

Controversy surfaces 
over safety belt law: 

A waste of time, money 



the 



By now everyone has seen 
televison commercials or read the 
news reports on Indiana's new safety 
belt law This law, which goes into effect 
this summer, requires the driver and 
front seat passenger to wear safety belts 
when traveling. 

"Buckling up" has been a major 
safety campaign for many years. It was 
only within recent times that car 
manufactuers began to put safety belts 
in all cars, which is required of them by 
federal safety standards 

The problems which Indiana will 
undoubtedly encounter— and have in 
some cases—are many. 

One problem is enforcing the law. A 
patrolman cannot stop every motorist he 
suspects is not wearing his safety belt. 
However,, the patrolman could stop a 
motorisl-Jor speeding, reckless driving 
— even a.hurnt-out taillight — and ticket 
the driver for not using his safety belt. 

Another problem is posting signs to 
make aware any out-of-state drivers 
entering Indiana. When driving to 
Michigan or Ohio, both of which have 
safety belt laws, you may have noticed 
the roadsigns which read something to 
the affect' of "The State of Michigan- 
Ohio requires the wearing of safety 
bells." But most of these signs are seen 
when crossing the state line on a major 
highway: 1 ;; . where stopping on the 
roadside is prohibited Not all motorists 
wear their'safety belts and putting them 
on while the car is in motion can be 
hazardous. 



Another problem with the safety belt 
law is older model ears. Some older 
automobiles are not equipped with 
safety belts, and as with Fort Wayne's 
smoke alarm law, the state should find 
some way of providing the addition of 
safety belts to motorists who cannot 
afford it themselves. 

How should these problems be dealt 
with? There aren't many ways to 
enforce the law without increasing state 
police manpower. One way to make 
motorists buckle up is by staging 
roadblocks along major roads. This 
would create more problems than it 
would solve, however, and many drivers 
would simply buckle up when 
approaching then unbuckle when 
departing. 

Another way could be to impose a 
monetary fine upon drivers not wearing 
safety belts — but only if they were 
pulled over for a separate violation. 

Signposting is a relatively easy 
problem to solve: although stopping 
along the freeway is prohibited, special 
strips just inside the state line could be 
marked off for motorists to pull over and 
buckle up. This would require posting 
signs to mark the area off, though. 

Wearing a safety belt is only common 
sense. Having a safety belt law merely 
wastes lawmakers' and law enforcers' 
time If a motorist chooses not to wear 
his safety belt then it is his 
responsibility. Requiring cars to have 
safety belts is more than enough.

Enforcement, fines needed 



The scene reminded me of so many 
others I've seen on the evening news ... 
skid marks, broken glass, demolished 
autos, ambulances, and sheet-covered 
bodies .cryiclims of yet another drunk 
driving ::jlcclflent. This time it was 
different;- An; innocent victim was a 
family irtember. 

One dai? gd on for days about drunk 
driving - and the penalties that should 
accompany it. In this case, however, 
there was;-3, different emphasis. The 
outcomeof the accident would have been 
different had the involved been wearing 
_ seatbelts. 

The drunk driver, as in so many cases, 
walked away uninjured The carload of 
teenagers were not as fortunate. White ■ 
two remained trapped in the wreckage, 
the third was thrown over the seat, 
through the windshield and down an 
embankment. Only one of the three wore 
seatbelts. She was treated and released. 
The other two were not as fortunate 

It is unfortunate that accidents and 
deaths sueh as these are needed to make 
people aware of the importance of 
seatbelts. It is not until tragedy strikes 
that one begins to look serious at the 
consequences. 

July 1 marks a very important date in 
Indiana's history. On that day, a state 
law goes into affect making it 
mandatory that all motorists and 
passengers wear seatbelts when 
traveling on Indiana roads This is long 
overdue. 

Statistics readily obtainable at police 
posts across the country reflect a need 
for strict enforcement of such a law. 
Although still six months away, 
opposition is being voiced Can these 
people truthfully say they see no benefit 
in this law? 



If you can honestly argue against this 
"invasion of rights" for once put 
yourself aside for a moment Consider 
your family ... the loved ones you'd be 
leaving behind if something would 
happen to you. Picture them at your 
funeral service or at your gravesite. 
Concentrate on their tears. Aren't they 
worth the extra two seconds it takes to 
buckle up? 

This law may be difficult to enforce at 
first. It will take time to get used to. 
Protesters argue that additional 
manpower will be needed to enforce the 
law. If that is indeed the case, which is 
itself arguable, the hiring of additional 
personnel would be warranted if 
responsible for the saving of human 
lives. In states already having this law. 
employment figures have not directly 
increased due to this addition. 

One final plea to motorists; even if you 
do not buckle up, for whatever reason, 
make it a priority to buckle up your 
children. They are too young to decide 
for themselves. Their lives are in your 
hands every time they are your 
passengers. In this new law there should 
be very stringent fines when children 
are found unbuckled. No excuse should 
be good enough to avoid a serious 
penalty. 

Although my children have always 
been secured, I never buckled myself in, 
basically due to laziness, until the other 
day ...on my way home from the funeral 
home. 

Hopefully as it becomes a taw, more 
and more people will see the importance 
of such state action Loud, unending 
applause should be given to those 
introducing this law to Indiana. 



\-Letters to the Editor 



To the Editor: 

I am writing in regard Lo 
the Heartland' strip that 
appeared in the Dec. 12 issue 
of The Communicator. Upon 
first reading this strip, I Felt 
its content was totally un- 
called (or land still do) and 
wondered why the editors 
were pressuring Mr Linville 
to do this. 



he assured me it was not due 
to pressure from his editors, 
bul rather the response to an 
inside joke concerning his 
"inability" lo draw a female 
figure. I could also un- 
derstand the problems with 
drawing the human body, as 
I am still at the "lollipop- 
shaped" tree stage. 
However, it would have 



been belter if Mr. Linville 
had not tried at all. Our 
society still tends to per- 
petrate a woman as "simple, 
childlike with tils" and this 
is exactly what this cartoon 
strip has done as well. 

Granted, Mr Linville 
assured mi' ihis was not his 
intention, but that does not 
excuse us from thinking 



about the i m plica t ions that 
Ihis representation of women 
brings forth. • 

Une must be careful when 
rcspuniiihK in ,i public forum 
to an inside joke— your 
readers would not know that 
your editors did not pressure 
you and (lie "humor" of the 
inside joke can be lost and 
even harmful to those who 
read your newspaper. 



We should, at least, at this 
university try not to continue 
to perpetrate sterolypes. I 
would urge The Com- 
municator staff to look at its 
copy in the future and do 
away with this form of 
stereotyping.

Exercise buffs gain much fromphysical activity 

Studies shatter 
exercise myths 



By GLENN WRIGHT 

Contrary to persistent 

myth, there is no evidence 
ihat we wear out our joints 
with physical activity. 

In fact, it may be quite the 
opposite For example, in 
spile of constant pounding 
running seems to give legs, a 
Finnish sludy found that 
runners were actually three 
to (our limes less likely lo 
have degenerative hip 
problems than non-runners. 
Several recent studies show 
lhat the joints (including 
injury-prone knees and 
anklesi of long-term high 
mileage runners are no more 
likely lo show signs of joint 
disease than those of non- 
runners. We "nourish" 1 our 
joints when we are active by 
Increasing blood supply 
around the cartilage Plus 
muscles, tendons and 
ligaments that support them 
become stronger. 

Osteoporosis, a thinning of 
the bones' density, is a 



'■silent" disease that may 
not reveal itself until a 
fracture occurs While a 
number of factors put 
women at a higher risk How 
calcium, low estrogen, ex- 
cess protein intake, 
smoking, alcoholism and 

authorities report that the 
primary' cause for bone loss 
is inactivity. 

Bones, like muscles, 
respond to exercise by 
becoming thicker and 
stronger Everett Smith, 
from the University of 
Wisconsin, has done ex- 
tensive studies with older 
women who have increased 
their bone mass with regular 
exercise. Smith claims lhat 
we would prevent 75 to 60 
percent of spine and hip 
fractures in this country by 
keeping our bones strong 
through exercise

Longer life a plus of exercise 



By GLENN WRIGHT 
A controversial theory for 
a reason to exercise has been 
lhat a longer life might be 
one of (he many benefits of 
regular exercise, Now there 
is new evidence to support 
that theory. 

A recent study shows that 
exercising regularly can add 
as much as two years to your 
length of life. 

Dr. Ralph Paffenbarger 
Jr., researcher a I a Stanford 



Uni 



sity 



Schoi 



or 



Medicine, followed almosl 
17.000 men, ages 35-74, o 
16-year period, 

He found lhat the mer 
exercised regularly I 
longer lhan those who 
less active. And the 
calories burned — up 
calories each week — tne 
greater the longevity 

The men who burned more 
lhan 500 calories but less 
lhan 1000 each week (equal 



O3500 



lo five to 10 miles of walking 
or jogging i reduced their 
risk of death by 22 percent, 
while men who burned i500 
calories each week had a 54 
percent reduction in risk. 

Benefits seemed to 
diminish as ihe amount of 
calories burned exceeded 
3500. 

Even people wilh known 
risk factors like smoking, 
obesity and family history of 
heart disease received some 
protection from i 



Most of us complain, at one 
lime or another, about how 
much lime exercise lakes, 
but Paffenbarger found that 
each lime you exercise, you 
gain some time. 

For every one hour spent 
exercising, the average 40- 
year-old man gains almost 
two hours of extended life.

Telephone 
registration: 

System eliminates 
long lines, waiting 

By PAULETTE WITTENBERG 

Stall Writer Oaklon College 

DES PLA1NES, 1L. — Oaklun Community College students 
are the first community college in Illinois to be able " 
register for classes by telephone. 

According to John Gagin, OCC's director of admissions and 
records, Oakton College and Bradley University are the only 
institutes in the slate lo have such a system. 

To register, the student calls 635-1616 and listens lo a short 
message which directs him to enter a code which 
corresponds to the purpose of the call: a registration call, a 
schedule revision, how much money is owed or to find out 
which classes the student has already enrolled. 

The computer requests the social security number, birth 
date and class code. 

All that's needed is a louch-tone telephone that makes 
different sound for each button pressed. "If students don't 
have a louch-tone phone in Iheir home, they can use the pay 
phones in the school. We will also have phones available tn 
Ihe building," said Maggie Hladilek of the admissions office. 

According to Gagin, over 200 students have enrolled lor the 
spring semester so far and it is going very well. "We strongly 
encourage students to talk with student services or see a 
counselor if they have any doubts or questions," said Gagin. 

Current studenls will receive a letter towards the' middle o( 
(he week explaining the new system and encouraging them to 
use the new system. 

When asked if students will ultimately be able to pay Iheir 
tuition by phoning in Iheir credit card numbers, Gagin said It 
would probably be instituted for the fall term. For now, 
tuition payment remains the same Students will receive a 
bill just as before. 

The new system is available for full or part-time students. 
Any new or transfer student can use the system if they Till out 
an application first- 
Phone registration hours are Monday-Thursday from 8:30 
a.m. to fl p.m., Friday from 8:30 am to 5 p.m. and on 
Saturday from 8:30 a.m. until noon.

by JUDY RAMSEY 
Staff Writer 
In December 1978, Mike 
Wallace on "60 Minutes" 
said, "thirty million 
Americans are overweight, 
and 15 million of these are 
■grossly' overweight." 
According lo a more recent 
government survey 
published in the Reader's 
Digest November, 1986. 
"Some 32 million adult 
Americans are overweight 

'severely' so 

Being ovi 
fun. Bet wee 
and taking 
American population has 
become totally obsessed 
with food. Food is fuel for the 
body's warmth and energy. 
It furnishes building 
materials for growth, repair 
and reproduction. Food also 
provides regulating sub- 
stances that enable the body 
to use other materials for 
energy production. 

The over-indulgence of 
food the body does not need 
or use is transformed into fat 
and deposited into various 
storage area in the body 
Over an extended period of 
time, these fat deposits 
begin to protrude altering 
the physical appearance of 
the individual. All loo soon, 
closets become packed with 
clothes which no longer fit, 
and health problems begin (o 
occur with regularity. 

In "Jane Fonda's Workout 
Book" Fonda said, "Snack 
foods, processed foods and 
convenience foods have 
become the staples of the 
American diet It's no 
wonder four out of 10

overweight." Weight is 
defined by Dr Paul J. Kiell, 
M.D. and Joseph S. 
Frelinghuysen in their book 
entitled "Keep Your Heart 
Running" as the "amount 
each individual has of fat, 
bone, muscle and other lean 
tissue and organs. Weight 
varies according to In- 
dividual types and 
characteristics." 

"Each year, ap- 
proximately one million 
Americans die from heart 
disease. More than 30 per- 
cent of adults are overweight 
as a result of too many 
calories and too little 
exercise." This information 
was excerpted from a 
pamphlet advertising a 
nutrition program called 
Healthy Ealing Lifetime 
Plan. H.E.L.P. was 
developed by the Registered 
Dietitians at Parkview 
Memorial Hospital to teach 
people how lo improve their 
eating habits The focus of 
this program is to educate 
the public about the facts 
concerning proper nutrition. 

Nutrition is defined in the 
Funk &amp; Wagnalls 

Encyclopedia as "the 
processes by which the body 
obtains, modifies and 
utilizes the chemical sub- 
stances required for growth 
and health ." When trying lo

weight loss in a matter of 

weeks. Unfortunately, this 
creates more hazards lo the 
health of the dieter than the 
extra weight. Jenny Smith, a 
dietician at Parkview 
Memorial Hospital said, 
"Anybody can loose weight 
on any kind of diet Keeping 
it off is the secret," 

Proper nutrition consists 
of seven basic food groups. 
Kiell and Frelinghuysen list 
these groups in the following 
manner: whole grains and 
cereals, dairy products, 
fruits, vegetables, meats, 
fish and poultry and eggs. 

Drinking, smoking and 
ingesting refined flour and 
sugar are discouraged. 
Eight glasses of water 
should be included in the 
daily diet to flush waste 
deposits from the body. Also, 
always consult the family 
physician before starting 
any diet program. 

Three basic diet rules 
given by Kiell and 
Frelinghuysen were: eat 
three meals a day, eat slowly 
and chew food properly 
before swallowing and 
exercise three to six days 
per week for 30-45 
minutes. Exercise brings 
Ihe food intake into balance 
with the energy output. It 
keeps the blood circulating 
to various parts of the body 
including the brain. Exer- 
cising is also a great way to 
feel better and relieve 
tension. 



Exercise can be broken 
down into two areas. One is 
the recreational exercises. 
These exercises contribute 
little lo one's overall fitness. 
Games, sports, leisure ac- 
tivities, golf, bowling and 
sailing are classified under 
this category. The second 
area is called the true fitness 
exercises. According to Kiel! 
and Frelinghuysen these 
exercises "develop the 
heart, blood vessels, lungs 
and limbers and strengthens 
muscle joints," Aerobics, 
calisthenics, and weight 
training are considered true 
fitness 



Students wishing to 
workout inexpensively can

basketball courts, an indoor 
running track and five

The Dance Collective is 
holding a dance concert on 
Feb. 7 to show off their 
performers. The Concert 
will be held at the Per- 
forming Arts Center and is 
titled "Far from the 
Freeway." A guest artist 
will be featured, Andrew 
Janetti, a co-director of the 
"Red Peonies Performance 
Project" in New York. 

Whether you are dancing 
for fun or just for the 
exercise, both schools have a 
dress code. The Dance 
Collective requires students 
in technique classes to wear 
leotards and tights. All other 
classes may wear easy to 
move in clothing. Students 
should be barefoot or 
wearing appropriate shoes. 

The Fort Wayne Ballet 
requires all of its ballet 
students to wear pastel or 
dark colored leotards and 
pink ballet shoes, and pink 
tights. For the jazz classes 
students should wear low 
heeled jazz shoes and a 
leotard. 

"Dance requires more 
concentration," states 
Monnier. "It's a good feeling 
to be able to achieve 
something."

Riding a three-game 

winning streak, the IPFW 

men's basketball team faces 

two Great Lakes Valley 

Conference road tests this 

week as they travel to Lewis, 

Thursday at 8:30 p.m.. and 

to St. Joseph's, Saturday at 

9:05 p.m. The Mastodons ore 

looking to improve on an 8-6 

mark with a 2-2 slate in 

GLVC action. 

Lewis is 9-5 on the year 
and 1-4 in GLVC play while 
St. Joseph's is 5-7 and 2-3 in 
the conference. IPFW lost to 
GLVC champion Lewis twice 
last season, 55-52 in the first 
meeting and 69-52 when the 
teams met later in the year. 
St. Joseph's and the 
Mastodons split their pair of 
games, St. Joe winning 74-73 



GLVC advancement 



IPFW's two-game con- 
ference winning streak has 
moved the &gt;Dons into a tie 
for fourth place in the Great 
Lakes ''Valley Conference 
with a 2-2 mark. Kentucky 
Wesley an tops the nine-team 
loop with a 4-0 conference 



mark. Wesleyan, 12-2 
overall, was ranked seventh 
in the nation in NCAA 
Division II in the initial 
NCAA poll released last 
week, One other league 
school, Lewis 19-5, 1-4) was 
also in the Top 20 at 19. 



despite a 20 point, 10 rebound 
effort by Bruce Erwin and 
IPFW taking a 63-61 win in 
the final game of the season 
with Jim Morlan scoring 19 
paints. 

IPFW's current three 
game win string matches 
their longest of the season 
set when the 'Dons won their 
first three games of the year. 



It's the first time since 1984- 
65 that they have won back- 
to-back games in conference 
play. 

Sophomore Bruce Roland 
tops the Mastodons with a 
16.1 scoring average and his 
6.3 rebounding mark is 
second on the squad. The 
'Dons have used a balanced 



attack this season as Bruce 
Erwin 112.1 points per game 
and 6.8 rebounds), Eric 
Wilson (11.7 and 1.3), Jim 
Morlan tll.fi and 7.1), and 
Charlie Washington (11.5 
and 3.9) are all averaging in 
double figures. 

Earlier this season, Jim 
Morlan passed Brian Grady 
to become IPFW's career 
rebounding leader. Morlan 
now has 498 rebounds for his 
career and should pass the 
500 mark (his week. He's 
also starting to move up the 
career scoring ladder. 
Morlan has scored 725 points 
in his career and needs just 
two points to tie Mitch 
Easterly (727) for seventh on 
the all-time list. Sixth place 
is also in sight in the next 
week as he needs just 29 
points to lie Rex Putt (744) 
for that position.

By law 3-3-1 of the NCAA 
guidebook tells us that every 
Division I and II member 
institution "shall limit its 
total playing schedule in 
each sport in any one year to 
the number of contests ... set 
forth in this section." 

For basketball, the magic 
number for the regular 
season is 28. Plus, the 
powers that be in Shawnee 
Mission allow another six 
additional games that it 
would take for any team to 
win the NCAA post-season 
championship. 

How then, did Louisville 
end up with a 32-7 record last 
year? And why was Duke 37- 
3? 

What I'm talking about is 
what 1 call inching. The 
NCAA's practice of allowing 
the schedule to grow a tiny 
bit each season, till now 
we've got to the point where 
the colleges are playing 




about half the number of 
games the pros are — a 
situation that is detrimental 
to the student-athlete which 
it depends on. 

Any team headed for Don 
Ho land can schedule games 
against any NCAA team on 
the islands — Hawaii-Hilo. 
Hawaii-Hula, Hawaii-Bikini, 
or Hawaii-Whatever. 
Believe me, there are 
schools on those atolls that 
even the government doesn't 



know about, and if a team is 
really desperate, it can 
always play the US Navy 
squad at Pear) Harbor. Also 
allowed is the Alaska 
Shootout, which gives us 
great insight into that 
famous phrase '"Call of the 
Wild" by Jack London. 

Think about it. What 
possible reason would 
coaches bring their team all 
the way to Alaska, where the 
nights are lone and thev olav 



in a Quanset hut in front of 
1,200 people — if there isn't a 
snowstorm? 

I guarantee you, next 
year, that a minimum of four 
teams from the Big Ten, the 
Big East, the ACC, the 
Southeastern and probably 
the Big Eight and PAC-10 
conferences, will all go to the 
NCAA tournament. And if a 
sleeper wins the post-season 
tourney, it automatically 

Next on our list of 
"Freebtes" are the foreign 
trips, the Summit Tours, 
that any member school is 
allowed to take once every 
four years. We're talking 10 
days of practice time here, 
and up to 20 basketball 
games being allowed. 

Off they go, to the Con- 
tinent, to the Mediterranean, 
Asia and the beat goes on. 
And then there's the ACC 
All-Star teams, the World 



Games, the Nicaragua 
Round Ball Classic, and of 
course, the Olympics. 
Today, there is moreof these 
trips than there are slot 
machines in Las Vegas. 

Finally, there's the pre- 
season warm-up game the 
NCAA allows against a 
foreign team — and usually 
it's that country's B or C 
team — which also doesn't 
count. Every year, around 
the first week of December 
the scoreboards are flooded 
with names like the Russian 
Nationals, the Crech 



Nationals, the Hungarian 
Nationals, and so on. And 
then there's the Athletes in 
Action teams — and there 
must be 20 of 'em — and as 
long as you let 'em preach at 
halflime, they'll be sure to 
show up. 

What's happening here is a 
slow trend — a slow edging 
towards pro ball. It's crazy. 
Today it seems like anything 
the student-athletes do can 
make them illegal — while 
the institutions can do just 
about anything. 



V-Ball squad awaits tough weekend 



ByDAURENJ. 
WAGGONER 
Sports Editor 
Arnie Bali, IPFW men's 
volleyball coach, won't have 
to wait long to gauge the 
talent level of his young 
team this season. The 
Volleydons, 2-2 on the year, 
host the Fort Wayne 
National Bank Volleyball 
Classic on Friday and 
Saturday in the IPFW 
Multipurpose Building with 
a nationally competitive 
Held on hand to contest for 
the tournament title. 



Defending champion Ohio 
State brings another strong 
team to town while Navy is a 
Top 20 contender and New 
Jersey Tech rounds out the 
strong field. The competition 
level should give Ball a good 
idea of how high his team 
can move in the Top 20 this 
year after finishing 15th last 
season. 

Ball has a solid core of 
veterans leading the 
Volleydons this season but 
he'll have to rely on a couple 
of younger faces to fill key 



spots. Senior Ted Owen and 
junior setter Phil Bodine are 
both seasoned players for 
the squad this year. Both are 
home town talents with 
Bodine from North Side High 
School and Owen from 
Heritage High School. 

Sophomore Jay Golsteyn 
was an all -Midwestern 
Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association selection last 
season and will be an im- 
portant offensive threat 
again this year. The West 
Allis, Wisconsin native is a 



definite all-America 
candidate. Other returning 
players are Keith 

Neargarder (Dayton, Ohio) 
and Bobby Kramer (Yellow 
Springs, Ohio). 

The newcomers expected 
to make the biggest impact 
are Andy Heffron (Min- 
neapolis, Minnesota) and 
Dan Springob (Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin). Springob is a 
transfer from the University 
of Wisconsin, where he was a 
standout for the school's club 
team.
