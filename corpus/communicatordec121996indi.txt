Policy puts restrictions on rollerblading 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

Complaints went to the 
administration, a ban went 
into play in an aliempi to 
alter their decision, and a new 
policy was finally made 
Controversy regarding 
rollerblading on campus has 
reached students throughout the fall 
semester 

In November, the University 
Resource and Policy Committee 
(URPC) recommended a new 
rollerblading/skateboarding policy 
due to the potential of personal 
injury and damage (o university 
property The policy was approved 
by ihe Executive Cabinet and will 
go into effect Jan. 1. 

At the beginning of the 
semester, several students and 
faculty began complaining about 
accidents taking place involving 
rollerbladers and skateboarders 
Those who posed complaints said 
they witnessed the skaters 
disturbing passing students and 
destroying university property. 

As a result of the complaints, 
the URPC began formulating a new 
policy. 

"We began working with the 
student government almost 
immediately after the complaints 
began," said Lauren DenHartog, 
Chief of Police. 

On Thursday, Sept. 26. George 
Gounans. Indiana Purdue Student 
Government Association ITPSGA) 




George 
Gounaris 



president, organized a rally lo 
protest an attempted ban by the 
URPC. Students gathered near 
Kettler Hall and signed petitions, 
talked about the 
and mainly 
gathered to show 
their support. 
The previous 
policy allowed 
students to skate 
for strictly 
transportation 
reasons only, not 
recreational. 
However, the 
,new policy has 
taken more 
serious steps. 

The URPC's new policy is 
putting a major restriction on 
skateboarders It will not allow any 
skateboarding in any IPFW 
budding or on the grounds at any 
time. 

Rollerblading is being 
prohibited from all buildings also, 
including the parking garage. 
However, it wdl be allowed, during 
daylight hours only, in all areas 
north of the Gates Sports Center 
One exception is the mall area at 
the entrances of the Fine Arts 
Building and the Williams Theatre. 
"It (the rollerblade rally) 
changed tbeir decision," said 
Gounaris. "Originally they were 
going to end it completely ." 

However, rollerblading will be 
restricted to certain locations It 
will be allowed in the area north of 



the sidewalk on the south side of 
the Gate Sports Center This new 
policy will allow one loop of the 
sidewalk and parking lots one, two 
and three for rollerblading during 
daylight hours only, 

"The new policy is going to give 
students a more clear-cut policy," 
said DenHartog "Before, it was a 
litde vague." 

In addition, certain conduct will 
be restricted. Rollerbladers and 
skateboarders cannot use excessive 
speed on the sidewalk, jump steps, 
benches, tables or engage in other 
types of acrobatic activities when 
rollerblading. and may not weave in 
and out of pedestrians on the 
sidewalks. Furthermore, there will 
be no skating in or around special 
events that may cause injury lo 
others. 

If the policy is violated, several 
penalties may be imposed. These 
penalties include removal from 
campus property, disciplinary 
action by (he dean of students, a 
$20 fine (skateboards may be 
confiscated until fines are paid) or 
criminal prosecution if the situation 
leads up toil. 

"I don't see it resolved in the 
eyes of the student body," said 
Gounaris. 

Students who have questions 
concerning Ihe policy should 
contact DenHartog, at 481-6827 

"It should cut down on the 
damage done lo university property 
and complaints from students and 
faculty," said DenHartog 




Rollerblading is limiled to parking lots one, two and three, located al the lop right c 
Offenders will be fined $20 and run the risk of having their skateboards confiscated.

Reward offered to end bomb threats 



by Paul Tupper 
Editor 

One would think it was a new 
class being offered on campus: 
Bomb Threat 101 But it's not, for 
would-be terrorists are teaming how 
to clear a building, without any 
instruction, by making a phone call, 
suggesting a bomb has been 
mysteriously planted within a 
building, causing all classes and 
offices to close in that building for 
an hour. 

But who pays for the lessons? 

Chancellor Mike Wartell says 
that all of us pay the price when 
someone makes a bomb threat on 
campus. 



"Our ability to provide our 
students with a bigh-qualiiy 
education is severely diminished 
when interruptions like this occur," 
said Wartell "Many of our students 
drive from out of town to attend 
classes or participate in study 
groups Building closings for bomb 
threats hinder their studies and 
waste their time " 

According to Lauren 
DenHartog, chief of University 
Police, when a bomb threat is 
received via phone, whoever 
receives the call notifies university 
police, who then notify (he 
chancellor's office and evacuate (he 
building. Each budding is closed for 
approximately one-and-a-half hours 



while i( is inspected. 

"This is a difficult thing to 
investigate," said DenHartog "But 
we have plans." 

Students are not the only group 
affected by bomb threats. When a 
building has to be evacuated, 
everyone musl go - including the 
chancellor, who usually lakes his 
paper work lo the cafeteria in Walb 
Union. 

"It's very annoying anytime 
your day gets interrupted because of 
a bomb threat," said Carl 
Drummond, assistant professor of 
geoscienccs, who recently had to 
cancel a final lab meeting because 
of a bomb threat. "There is no way 
to make up (he lost time." 



Resolution requires student presence 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

Consistency, (hat is the key. 

in the spring of '96, Kerry 
Adkins, former Indiana Purdue 
Student Government Association 
(1PSGA) presidential candidate, 
had been placed on probation after 
be was found guilty of trespassing 
in the Career Services Office. 

Adkins remained on probation 
after bis appeal was denied by the 
Campus Appeals Board in October. 
After the meeting, Adkins became 
angry when the board bad no other 
students present. He fell that the 
board was Dot fairly represented. 



As a result of situations such as 
this one, the student senate recendy 
reed on an 



^^^^^ "Amendment 

MA ^^ (be IPFW Code of 

IL. ^K Student Rights.

I to specifically 

'^■i f mandate the 

L_3HMBLJ formation of 

ChriS individual hearing 

Douse committees. The 

legislation was 

authored and 

sponsored by the Legislative Affairs 
Committee. 



"There was no previous policy. 
said Chris Douse. IPSGA's student 
body vice president. "It's not fair 
handle a panel without a student 
being there." 

The new resolution will require 
me committees to consist of two 
student members, two faculty 
members and one administrative 
member. The resolution is in 
contrast to the current policy that 
does not specify the make-up of 
bearing committees except as those 
designated by the chair of the 
Campus Appeals Board.

In an effort to minimize the

Columnist leaves, thanks everyone 




Just shoot me. The friggin holidays arrived 
and I could care less. It's not that I dislike 
spending time with my family, only some of 
mem. (I know this will never gel back to them 
because I never see tbem) 

But enough of that crap because I don't want 
this to be a rant. I want to leave this paper on a 
decent note, but then again "to thine own self be 
true." 

I don't really have a clue about why I'm so 
melancholy. Maybe it's the weather. Maybe it's 
because finals week is approaching and I am 
going to blow my grades and I know tt. I don't 
care because instead of studying I've been trying 
to conquer the world on my persona] computer. 

Ahh . . . hell. Who cares? 

Someone musL 

My mother does. She gave me a Christmas 
present four years ago. A class at IPFW. I was 
fresh off a divorce and 1 needed to get my life 
back on track. My mother and stepfather made 



my return to school possible. 

Without them, I would not be able to 
work at this paper or go to night classes or 
have any son of a life outside IPFW and 
the various vocations I have had. You see 
they watch my six-year-old son for me 
while I'm at school or at The 
Communicator. 

My mother made a deal with me to 
watch Jacob while I'm at school until I 
graduated They have become a large pan 
of his life. He's a belter person because of 
their help 
Thank you. 

My father always believed in me and 
knew 1 could accomplish anything I wanted to do. 
Even when I didn't even believe in myself. He is 
a great father, but I never realized that unul 1 
became a father myself. 

I really need to thank everyone with whom 
I've worked with at The Communicator. I wish I 
could name mem all . . . 

1 ili ink I will, it's my damn column so bite me 
if you don't like it! 1 might. 

This may not be in order, so forgive me: 
Kristie Kicci-Schlundt, Ramona McGowan. Fred 
Douse, Steve Ketley, Kara Wbiting. Megan 
McCardle, Michelle (Tisland) DiNovo, Nathan 
Sommers, Robert Squatrito, Rachel Deltmer. 
Melissa Young. Jeremy Ecenbarger, Sara 
Valentine, Amanda Man ion, Andrew Yoder, 
Jennifer Sons. Jcb Waldscnmidt, Travis Stahl. 
Christy Beauchot, Jim Porter and Cassie Ritter. 

All of you — be proud of your 
accomplishments at mis paper. You have done 



something special — thankless jobs for lilUe pay. 
You did your job well and with pride My respect 
goes out to each and every one of you. 

To everyone who read my columns ovct the 
last couple of years. Your commenLs have made it 
all worthwhile. Every writer needs a reader and I 
know I bad a few. I enjoyed hearing your 
comments Even the bad ones. 

Several people have made a tremendous 
impact on my life I happened to meet these , 
people ai The Communicator. They have enriched 
my life more than I can measure 

Paul Tupper, what more can I say? He's my 
friend. When 1 was editor, he was a huge pari of 
wby we accomplished what we did. He was the 
driving force. 

Eric Ledbeiter. I love arguing with ibis man. 
He helps me make my arguments sound better 
and makes me think through most everything I 
have written I will miss him when he leaves for 
the big city. 

Janet Tobey. no one has helped me grow more 
as a person in tbe last year than Janet Sue is 
probably me closest friend I have. She brings me 
up when I'm low and listens to me vent my 
frustrations. She's someone special to me. 

Lastly I warn to thank Done Reynolds, the 
publisher of The Communicator. Her input 
(whether I listened to it or not) was helpful in my 
becoming a successful entity at this paper. The 
Communicator will lose a good teacher/adviser if 
she ever leaves. 

Farewell May peace and love be with you for 
evermore. And just to close out my column on a 
familiar note, ahhh. f#@% it, you do the math!!!

't44M- t*il 



This semester has come and 
gone in rather a blur. [ 
thought for sure I would be 
done after last spring, but sure 
enough I received another magical 
phone call and I answered, allowing 
me to stretch my First Amendment 
rights to the Limbaugh-like limit! 

This time, 1 wdl be gone for 
sure Working during the day with 
degree long-since in band and 
graduate school about to begin. I 
need to pull some energy drains in 



and surge 
forth. Sorry 
to the athletic 
department, 
and to those 
whom I have 
afflicted with 
religion 
commentary, 
I am now out 
^lcfa{, of your hair! 

With the 
Christmas 
holiday just 
around the 
comer, step back once and see 
beyond the crowded shopping malls 
and abundant turkey leftovers and 
look at some of life's more 
important questions. 

By the way, I will say 
Christmas, not just holiday; it 
started as a celebration of Christ's 
birth and besides, it's freedom of 
speech. 

Long before Saint Nicholas took 
to the scene in a slightly more 
humble fashion, and before any 



such thing as a Christmas ' 
became vogue, the real reason for 
the holiday's celebration came to 
earth without any of the notoriety 
which accompanies today's 
festivities. 

Jesus Christ appeared on the 
scene when most of the known 
world's primary concerns were 
deeper than mother's or brothers 
Christmas present. 

The world then under the 
crushing weight of Roman rule, 
people yearned for a deliverance 
Our society now under the 
influences of spiritual apathy and 
crass materialism, people invisibly 
yearn for something to fill the 
emotional void existent within tbe 
human soul. 

Money doesn't do it; 
millionaires constantly make the 
news for stealing more mdlions 

Jesus, the one and only, came to 
show mankind to God, 
overshadowing monetary or 
material concerns. Not concerned 
with the means of the people He 



came down to. He came to earth 
through a working-class carpenter 
family and was first gazed upon by 
penniless shepherds. 

Like those shepherds and like 
die kings who later visited Him 
("wisemen" is an appropriate 
name), anyone who wants to go to 
Jesus is welcome. He didn't turn 
away the shepherds for lack of 
offering and He still lakes in anyone 
who will come to Him. 

During the year I spent in Africa, 
I celebrated Christinas with people 
who make far less than S1.000 per 
capita per year and they had a better 
grasp of die Christmas event than 
tile average American. 

While wreaths, holly. Russian 
tone and elegant wrappings are tun. 
Christmas is more meaningful with 
a Savior to celebrate. 

I am going on, with much of the 
rest of the staff leaving at the same 
time As I depan I hope each one 
will find greater meaning to 
Christmas than presents under a tree 
and strained family gatherings.

Spanking: 

beating 

or bettering? 



by Leab Morris 
Guest Columnist 

To many parents, grocery 
topping lends to be very stressful 
As you axe walking down the aisle, 
you and many other bystanders 
may see a parent losing their 
temper They reach over to thcir 
cbild and grab their arm and make 
them bend over They smack the 
child's buttocks excessively 

Then the child starts screaming 
and causes even more of a scene in 
the store. This makes me 
sympathize for the poor. 
defenseless child. This type of 
behavior belittles the child and 
makes the parent look like they are 
at their wits end and have 
uncontrollable children As a 
daycare provider. I have seen 
different techniques that work and 
would be a good alternative to 
spanking. 

Many parents are confused 
about discipline procedures The 
confusion is brought on by so many 
conflicting opinions. One book 
says one thing, another says just the 
opposite. 

The next door neighbor advises 
one type of discipline procedure, 
while the other neighbor swears 
against it. Parents are continually 
asking themselves questions such 
as: 

"Am I being loo strict? Am I 
being too permissive? Was it wrong 
of me to spank Jesse this morning?" 

Spanking is used by most 
parents to make their lives easier It 
is the "lazy" discipline. When 
parents' anger is finally to the point 
of when they have had enough, 
they explode, which brings upon 
spanking It helps the parents to 
relieve built up tension caused by a 
long day at work. 

Spanking makes the parents' 
lives easier by having the 
punishment be over so quickly, so 
they do not have to deal with the 
child's behavior It also makes the 
child's life easier by letting them 
off the book. 

If the child knows the pain is 
only going to last a couple of 
seconds, they are just going to try 
harder not to get caught. Spanking 
does not improve behavior, it just 
stops the behavior temporarily The 
child becomes more preoccupied 
with the feeling of pain that is about 
to come upon them that they forget 
about what they did wrong to get 
themselves punished. 

Behaviors can be unproved by 
using other techniques such as lime 
outs, toys taken away or grounding 
Although spanking may stop the 
child's behavior temporarily, these 
other techniques are the pain free 
ones for your child thai may have a 
longer lasting effect. 

There are certain dilemmas that 
cause parents to spank. Parents say 
tbey have tried everything and 
supposedly nothing works 
anymore But instead of using 
spanking, many other techniques 
will work if used m the correct way. 

Also, with spanking some 
parents want to use it as 
reinforcement of safety lessons. An 
example of this would be if a child 
runs into the middle of the street 
without looking both ways before 
crossing and almost gets bit by a 
car. 

Parents think thai spanking the 
child for these actions will help the 
child remember not to do it. 
Actually, the child will only 
remember for a couple of days. 

A better way to teach a child to 
cross the street is to go with them 
and teach them to look both ways 
before crossing. The child should 
not be allowed to cross the street, 
until they can remember the steps 
to crossing the street and snow 



responsibility. 

Parents also want their children 
to know what it feels like when 
tbey fight with others As parents, 
you witness your oldest child 
beating up on your younger child. 
Most parents do not want their 
children to hit and fight Parents 
want this behavior to stop So in 
order to get the older child's 
attention, the child gets spanked 

This is the wrong punishment. It 
actually shows the older child that 
it is okay to bit. The picture that it 
paints in the child's mind is that 
Mom or Dad is bitting me so it is 
okay to hit. I know that you are 
thinking the child is not going to be 
able to figure that out But, children 
are very smart and perceptive 
human beings. 

Spanking causes bad memories. 
As parents, you want the memories 
that your chdd may have to be 
great. But spanking causes bad 
memories They forget some of the 
pleasureful memories and insert 
them with the ones of getting hit. 

And adults that remember 
gelling spanked as a child, now say. 
"I was spanked and I turned out 
okay." But what the adults do not 
remember is what they felt before, 
during and after getting spanked 

I was spanked as a child and 
yes, I did turn out okay even though 
the spanking was used excessively 
in my point of view But the 
fix- lings I felt towards my parents 
was resentment. I may be a fine 
adult now but, I sure did not feel 
this way while I was getting 
spanked. 

Hitting may also lead to abuse 
When parents use spanking as the 
only method of discipline, the 
parent may spank the child twice as 
long and twice as hard. That type of 
spanking may lead to abuse. 

No one really knows where the 
line is drawn for abuse when it 
comes to spanking. I know that you 
as parents do not want to go to jail 
for taking spanking to the point 
where it is classified as abuse. 

This also presents the fact that 
the child my become abusive as an 
adult. This happens especially in 
males. They may grow up to be 
abusive husbands and fathers 

Spanking does have many 
effects on children These effects 
need to be taken into consideration 
because children arc the next 
generation lis no fun knowing that 
you've been too rough on your 
child. After all. be is your own flesh 
and blood, and you love nun dearly 
It must hurt, as a parent, to see a 
child hurt and crying, especially 
when iii.. pain was brought upon by 



The meaning of Christmas 



by Mary Rt*gling-Fre*ze 
Guest Columnist 

To feel the "spirit of love" and 
see the world through the eyes of a 
child lakes a special gift I was 
doubly blessed, as both my parents 
knew how to love, not only at 
Christmas, but every day I 

learned this lesson well on 
Christmas Eve 1958. 

Oliver Street and all the roof 
tops were covered with fresh snow 
that bad fallen earlier that morning 
A snowman stood in the front yard, 
and sunset revealed brilliant colors 
on bushes and around the frames of 
the bouses on the block. 

Daddy (his name is Bill) was in 
our cozy, warm kitchen, humming a 
cheery rune as he put away dishes 
from supper The smell of fresh- 
baked gingerbread filled every 
room of the bouse 

Mama was at the dining room 
table wrapping a few last minute 
packages for family and friends. 
Her list always included the 
mailman, milkman, paper boy, Avon 
lady, Fuller Brush and Watkins men. 
parish priest, the sisters that taught 
school and several close neighbors. 
She always felt they deserved "a 
little something." 

They had all received something 
the week before, but there was 
always one more last minute gift. 
As for us children, we were all 
under the tree playing with our 
"Lionel" trains (hat Daddy 
traditionally set up every Chrisimas. 

We weren't nch. but our spirits 
were Our hearts, minds and 
stomachs were always full, as was 
our house. Full of love, we were 
truly blessed 

Several weeks before Ibis 
solemn evening. I had expressed a 
sadness of heart to my mother, 
regarding a classmate who didn't 
think Santa would come* to ber 
bouse ibis year I remember 
wondering how this could happen, 
as she was as good a girl as I was 
and Santa always came to me 

Mama felt my pain and asked 
me not to worry, that Santa would 
come to my friend, she just knew in 
her heart that he would. 1 listened to 
my Mama, 'cause 1 believed she 
knew everything and was never 
wrong 

So on this memorable Christmas 
Eve. Mama gathered all of her 
children around ihe table and asked 
us if we'd like to help ber fix a 
basket for a "Christmas surprise." 
In a matter of seconds and before 
the affirmative shouts bad vanished, 
we were all transformed into elves. 

There before us was a huge, 
brown-wicker basket; a beautiful 
red ribbon (the largest I had ever 
seen); and a box full of a variety of 
fruits and nuts Wow! I didn't know 
who it was for, but I thought they 
must be really "special " 

Mama knew ... she had known 
for weeks. I'm sure she sacrificed 



DASH-IN 




many things to be able to afford the 
basket, fruits, nuts and ribbon to 
assemble such a lovely gift. We all 
helped arrange the fruit and as a 
finishing touch, she bed the large 
velvet ribbon onto the handle 

It was magnificent! I wondered 
why she wouldn't let me put a tag 
on it saying "Love and Merry 
Christmas from the Perkins 
Family." but she reminded me lhat it 
was a "surprise." so I understood 1 
also wondered why I was allowed to 
stay up extra late that night Mama 
wanted to be sure that my friend's 
family was asleep, I guess. 

Soon Daddy said, "Aggie, I'll go 
out and warm the car. Come out 
when you're ready." 

Mama said, "Children, get your 
mittens, scarves, galoshes and coats 
on, and go out and get in the car 
with daddy." 

"Where are we going?" I asked. 

Again, I was reminded of our 
"surprise." I laughed as 1 went out 
to the car Surprises were fun. and I 
fell so tickled to be doing this with 
my wbole family What's more. I 
remember feeling how calm the 
night was There was a special kind 
of stillness that filled me with 
wonder and an extra sense of peace. 

As 1 climbed into our '55 Chevy 
station-wagon, the smell of "Sir 
Waller Raleigh" filled the air 
Daddy was smoking his favorite 
pipe ... we drove off Again, a 
sensation came over me — I wasn't 
sure where I was going, but it felt 
real good 

After driving a few blocks, 
daddy stopped tbe car. I looked out 
the window and realized that I was 
in front of my friend's house 
Quietly mama said, "Follow me 



All the hide elves tippy-toed in 
the snow up to my friend's front 
porch 

As we placed the fruit basket 
down. Mama said, "Okay, let's get 
back into tbe car and never, never 
tell them who this gift came from, 
okay? Let's let tbem ihink that 
Santa brought it" 

I held my mittened bands to my 
face and giggled joyfully. I 
remember feeling this was a good 
thing. As we crept back (o the car. I 
was overcome with the "spirit of 
love." 

The true spirit of Christmas 
awoke within me, and I realized thai 
my Christmas 1958 bad taken place 
at that very moment — thai whatever 
I felt tomorrow morning, while 
opening my gifts, would only be a 
pan of the deep joy I felt tonight I

Q&amp;A 



Q. How can I protect 
myself from HIV 
infection? 

A. ■ Not having sex. 

■ Having sex with only 
one mutually faithful, 
uninfected partner. 

■ Not shooting drugs or 
sharing needles and 
syringes. If your 
sexual behavior places 
you at risk, latex 
condoms used 
correctly every time 
you have sex can 
reduce, but not 
eliminate, your risk.

Journey to Diversity 



^iiadimg my way 



by Paul TUppcr 
Editor 



With this semester-long 
experiment I named 
"Journey 10 Diversity." 
1 wanted to explore life as an 
outsider looking in. I knew as a gay 
person what i( is like having 
neterosexism shoved in my face. 
and I knew what it is like growing 
up without any role models thai I 
could admire and after whom 1 
could pattern my life. Yet 1 was sure 
my experiences were not exclusive, 
and I think this experiment supports 
that hypothesis. But bow can 
someone who isn't sure what 
diversity is begin to find it within 
themselves. I can't answer this, but 
1 can tell the story of when I began 
to embrace diversity. 

For me. tapping into my diverse 
side wasn't difficult As a child, I 
grew up in a cesspool of negative 
racial commentary. And I always 
knew that what I beard in reference 
to blacks, Jews and Latinos was not 
representation of what 1 fell of the 



human race. So knowing that instantly knew this was a product of 

diversity was important to me was our current system of oppression, 
not a surprise, nor was Then I started to lake classes in 

understanding that racial tension which I knew 1 would encounter 



was a bigger problem , 
than anyone close to 
me cared to speak 
about. 

Finally, it was 
when I entered this 
campus that 1 realized 
how bad the problem 
really was. I looked at 
Tbe Communicator, 



'I feel compelled 
to destroy the 

myth that 
diversity is a 



discourse about 
diversity Courses 
such as philosophy. 
Intercultural 
Communication. 
Controversy in 
America and 
Women, Men and 
Media have offered 
alternati 



which was tackling matter Of political education of race. 



the issue of race with 
full vigor at the time, 
and I saw intelligent 
people saying 
intelligent things with 
regards to race and 
gender. And then I 
looked at my fellow 
students In the four 
classes I was taking at 



correctness. 
That's simply not 
true. Diversity is 
about respect." 



gender and religion 
that my high 
school education 
failed to deliver. 
And it was in those 
classes that I 
started to become 
the informed 
opinionated person 
that 1 strived to be 



the time. I only shared one class I feel compelled to destroy the 

with an African-American woman myth that diversity is a matter of 

who sat quietly, never feeling political correctness That's simply 

confident enough to participate I not true. Diversity is about respect. 



Respect those whose life and 
experiences make them different. 
Know when you encounter a film, 
television show or advertisement 
that is insulting to someone who 
doesn't fit in your "group" And 
don't be afraid to confront those 
closest to you who use diversity 
and ethnicity as punch lines to bad 
jokes. Those jokes aren't funny and 
your friends need you to tell them 
that. 

Whenever I openly discuss 
diversity, I am reminded of tbe 
"melting pot" theory, This was a 
way of telling our valuable people 
of color that they should be more 
like us - the white people But that 
rationale is so wrong. Let me re- 
equate it like this: 

Take that melting pot and try to 
make soup. If every ingredient 
lasted the same, it would be a very 
bland soup. Add spices of different 
colors to the soup and the soup will 
taste better. The same thing is true 
with our time on Eartb. Add people 
of color in your life and your life 
(and theirs) will be more fulfilling.

Public opinion worries 
PepsiCo, causes changes 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

Sometimes it takes an old idea (o solve 
current problems. Since protesting worked in 
the sixties, many thought protesting would 
work in the nineties, It looks like it has. 

Recently. PepsiCo responded to the 
boycott being placed upon them throughout 
the country In hopes of mending their public 
relations, according to Louise Finnerty, 
president of government affairs for PepsiCo, 
the company has withdrawn many of their 
business relations from Burma. 

"We do listen and care about the world- 
wide public opinion, especially our 
consumers, customers and investors," stated 
Finnerty in a letter sent to The Communicator 
office. "So we've decided to sell our slake in 
that business." 

The company chose not to comment 
formally. But Wendy Wiilauer. a consumer 
relations specialist for PepsiCo, questioned 
whether our campus was large enough to 
have any effect on the public with an article. 

Until now. Finnerty said PepsiCo had 
been a minority partner in Pepsi Products 
Myanmar. Ltd., a privately owned joint 
venture with a Burmese entrepreneur. 



"We believe that we 
were a good employer, 
paving the employees 
more than twice the 
government's 
minimum wage, and 
contributing to sports 
and youth programs," 
said Finnerty 

Within the letter.

Children, faculty perform 
ensembles in Neff 



by Shannon Flnton 
Staff Writer 

Just in time for Christinas, the 
sound of children's music is being 
provided for students' ears. 

When music students on campus 
were unable to participate, children 
and faculty decided to take it upon 
themselves to perform in various 
recitals on campus. 

The IPFW Department of Music 
is proud to announce the IPFW 
Recorder Ensemble in concert. 
Sunday, Dec. 15, at 7:30 p.m. in the 
Neff Recital Hall. 

The concert will feature IPFW 
faculty and children from Abbett 
Elementary and Haverhill 
Elementary Schools in recorder 
ensembles. Tickets will be 
purchased at the door for $2. 

"It was supposed to involve 
college students, however there 
wasn't enough involvement," said 
Jacqeline K. Loomis, director of the 
the ensemble and instructor at the 
two elementary schools. 



Therefore, the faculty met and 
decided to do it themselves " 

Loomis said she later asked the 
administrators of the schools if the 
children could participate also. 

The program is completely 
instrumental, bestowing upon the 
audience a variety of different 
recorders. The different types of 
recorders include the soprano 
recorder, the alto recorder and the 
viola da gamba. Another attraction 
will be the harpsichord, which is 
like a piano but quite smaller. 

The recorders look like flutes, 
but all have different sounds. They 
are made of plastic, are smaller than 
the flute and are all different colors 

Works to be performed include 
"Sonata V" by Sammartini; 
"Fantasia I" by Lupo; and "Sonata" 
by Boismortier. 

"We're really excited about it," 
said Loomis. 

Students interested in more 
information about ensemble may 
contact Loomis, at 481-6811.

"I think 
its a great idea," 
said Marian

dean of 
students. 
"There is a 
loophole in the 
system that 
needs to be 
cleared up. It's 
precedent to 
have a student 

there." 

According to Zimmerman, the 
Adkin's incident was the only 
appeal she could remember that did 




not have a student presenL She said 
that the board decided to go ahead 
and hold the meeting because it had 
been planned so far in advance. 

"The student just didn't show 
up," said Zimmerman. "There 
should be alternative students and

was a good experience."

field-goal shooting 

After showing some dismay with 
her players' effort during tbe 
season's first two contests, Bowden 
said she thinks the team is beginning 
to play with more intensity. 

"I think tbe kids played hard," 
Bowden said of the team's effort, 
"they just didn't shoot well. 

"I( was a new environment for 
them." 

The Flyers hammered the 'Dons

IPFW's men's basketball team goi its firsi 
tasie ol defeat last week, but then started the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference season with a 
win over Bellarmine College to up its record

"We didn't play well (in the first half)." 
IPFW coach John Williams said. 

"We just did not come out ready lo play 
in the first half." 

IPFW shot 41 percent from ihe field and 
gave up six three-pointers while spotting the 
Thunder a 41-32 half-time lead. 

Williams' troops began to silence ihe 
Thunder during the second half, building a 
five-pomi lead at one point before falling 
down in the final minutes, 

According to Williams, the first half was 
the key: if the Mastodons had stayed with 
Tri-Siate during the initial 20 minutes, all 
would have been well. IPFW out-rebounded 
ihe Thunder by 12 and held TSU lo 30 



percent field-goal shooting in the second

Kmgbl guard Brad Bixler and isolated A1I- 
American candidate Sieve Mercer on the 
inside lo pull out the win. 

"Our guys did a great job on (Mercer)." 
Williams said. "Kevin started out on him." 

Bixler hit six ihree-pointers for all of his 
18 points as ihe Knights shot 33 times from 
long range. An outside-oriented (earn, the 
Knights connected on 11 treys for 33 
percent, 

"We did a good job defending (ihe 
perimeter)," Williams said. 

Mastodons Beady and company held 
Mercer, a three-time all-GLVC selection, to 
only seven shots and 13 points, and 
Bellarmine hit 34.5 percent for the game 



Porter led the 'Dons with 22 points and 
Jason Werling and Kyle Kirby scored 1 1 and 
10, respectively, in a reserve role 

"Jason and Kyle came in and really 
picked us up," Williams said
