Judge fines student 
for campus incident 



Indiana University- Purdue University at Ft- Wayne 



April 30, 1981 



By SANDRA WILEY 
Editor-in-chief 

. Jane Bartholomy, an elementary 
education student here, was convicted 
April 27 in Allen County Superior Court 
on charges of disregarding a stop sign 
and resisting arrest. 

The charges stemmed from an in- 
cident Feb. 25 on the west drive of the 
campus involving Bartholomy, campus 
police sergeant Larry Gaff and city 
police officers Rick Bodeker and 
William Wismer. 

At the time of the incident, Bar- 
tholomy lodged a complaint of 
harassment against Gaff with 
university officials. 

Bartholomy was given the minimum 
fine and sentence — S10 and costs for 
disregarding the stop sign and £50 and 
costs plus a 30-day suspended sen- 
tence—for resisting arrest— by 
Superior Court judge Dal ton C. 
McAlister who presided in the case. 

Although Bartholomy has 30 days in 
which to appeal the court's decision, 
she said in a phone interview Tuesday 
morning she does not intend to appeal. 

"I'd never want to go through it (the 
incident and court proceedings) again. 
I felt totally victimized," shesaid. 

Bartholomy said she thought her 
inability to find a witness to the incident 



who would support her claim of in- 
nocence was a major factor in losing 
the case. She said she had believed, 
however, she would be found innocent 
of the charges even without witnesses, 

"I guess I was somewhat idealistic in 
believing, because I was telling the 
truth, everything would come out 
alright in court," Bartholomy said. She 
still maintains her innocence. 

Campus police chief Maurice Shady 
doesn't agree. "I think the court's 
finding speaks for itself," Shady said in 
a Monday interview. 

At the time of the incident, Shady said 
the campus police department fully 
supported Gaff. "According to his 
report, he was properly executing his 
duties," Shady said at that time. 

Sergeant Gaff refuses to comment 
on the incident or the outcome of the 
court precedings. 

Bartholomy said she does not plan to 
pursue further her charge that Gaff and 
the city officers had verbally and 
physically harassedher. 

"I lodged my protest with university 
officials so that they would know about 
what happened," Bartholomy said. "I 
hope it has some effect on how they 
(campus officers) treat people in the 
future."

Senate urges higher PIT casting ratio 



ByJ.G.GRISWOLD 
Staff Writer 

IPFW could have a new grade ap- 
peals policy early next fall, replacing a 
"not too well of a defined and uni- 
formed policy," according to Rudy 
Svoboda, chairman of the Faculty 
Senate's Educational Policy Com- 
mittee (EPC). 

Two other such proposals have 
previously gone before the Indiana and 
Purdue Senates. Both measures failed 
to pass. 

Svoboda said that he could not predict 
whether his committee's proposed 
policy would pass the newly combined 
Indiana-Purdue Faculty Senate. 

According to 0. Franklin Kenworthy, 
assistant vice chancellor for academic 
affairs, IPFW does not have a campus- 
wide grade appeals policy. "Each 
department has its own policy," said 
Worthy. 

Svoboda believes that the proposed 
policy is "relatively sL-nple. The 
policy we propose will allow students to 
have a well determined procedure that 
is acceptable to the faculty," Svoboda 
said. 

The EPC proposal calls for a three- 
step procedure 1 for a student to follow 
who believes that he has received an 
unfair grade or a grade that is a 
product of a clerical mistake. 

The first step for a student wishing to 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

Chief Reporter 

Two resolutions, new Senate 

positions, presidential appointments, 
and six new Senate petitioners were the 
issues at hand when the newly elected 
Student Senate met for the first time 
April 22. 

The Senate decided to help out what it 
found was a significant number of left- 
handed students by resolving to 
recommend the purchase of left-handed 
desks for Kettler Hall. 

Kent Bowman, the originator of the 
resolution, said that he had talked to 
Don Katler, director of purchasing. 
According to Bowman, Katter said that 
10 percent of all the class rooms in the 
new building (Building D, located 
between Neff Hall and the Helmke 
Library ) would contain left-handed 
desks, and that part of that 10 percent 



would be moved to Neff Hall. 

Katter said no desks would be moved 
to or purchased for Kettler Hall 
because of the old style of desks already 
there, according to Bowman. 

Next, a heated debate centered 
around a resolution to urge a TO percent 
IPFW student casting ratio for each 
Purdue Indiana Theater (PIT) 
production. The resolution was even- 
tually passed. 

PIT already has a 55 percent student 
casting ratio. The Senate stated that 
more IPFW students, especially 
theater majors, should be cast intoeach 
production to gain the experience of the 
stage instead of non-IPFW students 
getting the roles. 

The Senate pointed out there are 
other playhouses in the Fort Wayne 
area in which non-fPFW students can 
perform and cited this fact as a reason 



for the resolution. Debate on the topic 
was so strong that three motions were 
needed to end it. 

Former Senate President Steve 
Westrick was elected as President Pro 
Tern of the Senate. Senator Ron Diehl 
was elected Sergeant at Arms. 

Kent Bowman was appointed 
Internal Affairs Committee Chair- 
person, Steve Westrick was appointed 
Legislative Affairs Committee 
Chairperson, and Tom Harris and Ron 
Diehl were appointed co-chairpersons 
of the Student Affairs Committee. 

Cathy Kortenber was appointed by 
Student Body President Ken Schenk to 
fill the vacant Purdue seat of the Joint 
Athletic Committee. Schenk also ap- 
pointed Student Body Vice President 
Ellen Engleman as a member of the 
IPFW Student Newspaper Inc. Board 
of Directors. 



Among decisions made was a gen- 
tlemen's agreement among the 
Senators to spend at least three hours a 
week working in the Students' 
Government Office. The Senate passed 
its Standing Rules for new Senators and 
decided that at least two-thirds of the 
acting membership of the Senate had to 
be present at each meeting in order to 
obtain a quorum. 

The Senate accepted six Senate 
petitioners. Bruce Clark, Coleen Clark, 
Julia Shaffer, Don Guffey, Mark 
Smedal, and Kevin de Ville are the new 
Senators. 

Senator Kent Bowman announced 
that the bicycle race around the 
Westlarid Mall will be held on May 9. 
Any interested IPFW organization 
which would like to participate should 
visit the Students' Government Office 
or contact Kent Bowman for details. 



Psychology classmates investigate pornography 



By WAYNE STEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

"Pornography is a way of life. It is a 
consistent objectification of women. 
And it includes children more and 
more," said Beth Beams, an anth- 
ropology major. 

"Pornography separates us from our 
humanness. You don't have to interact 
with someone if you make them an 
object. It frees you from respon- 
sibility," shesaid. 

"It's much the same as we do in 
warfare. We make the enemy an object 
so that we can kill. Sex and aggression 
become so entwined that you can't tell 
the difference," shesaid. 

Nancy Gray, a medical technology 
major, agreed. "People don't see the 
violence and it is sometimes very 
subtle. Pornography looks like sex, and 
sex is more accepted today in society, 
so pornography is accepted," she said. 

Both women are members of 
Psychology 493, an interdisciplinary 
class taught by Rick Johnson and 
Catheryn Adamsky, which has been 
studying pornography this semester. 

' "Oneof the favorite techniques of the 
pornographers to achieve a 
dehumanizing effect is to fragment the 
bodies of women, focusing only on 
Certain parts of the anatomy to excite 
interest," Beams said. 

&gt; It is interesting to take a stroll 
through the racks of an "adult" 
bookstore. On one cover you see a 
woman's hand, on another a foot, and 
On a third the head and shoulders. But 
the men in the pictures or drawings are 
always shown as complete individuals, 
and always in control, 

■ Women are catalogued In Hie same 
way as puppies in a pet shop; by size, 
weight, and breed. The shelves are kept 
neat and well organized. You would 
never find a "red-hot stepmother" in 
the middle of the "teen nymph" sec- 
tion. 

. "Men are shown that it is okay to 
rape women and to beat them and tie 
them up. Men are told that women 
enjoy that sort ol thing even though 
they would never admit it," Gray said. 

"People should be educated to the 
truth. I don't want to be thought of that 
way Pornography is duping a lot of 
people," shesaid. 

But you don't have to go sneaking 
through the back streets to find por- 
nography. M.A. Rager, another 




Qmaicitr'8( 

■s)*y 



member of the class, pointed out 
"pornography is everywhere. It's 
always in the public eye and easily 
accessible ' to kids— magazine ads, 
recordalbum covers, etc." 

This type or pornography is often 
called "soft" pom or "erotica." 
"Erotica is less violent than hardcore 
pornography. I feel that hard core is 
worse because there is more 
degradation of the human body," 
Rager said. 

Beams disagreed. ' 'Soft porn is more 
dangerous because it is more subtle. 
It's the lady in the car ad in the low- 
necked dress, it's the deodorant 
commercial with the sexual innuendo. 
Hard core is easily recognized, soft is 
seen as very natural," shesaid. 

"Soft porn is sex used to sell 
products. The issue Is exploitation. We 
have to stop the* exploitation without 

reducing sensuality, "Beamssaid. 

Al the present time, stopping or even 
controlling pornography seems to be 
next to impossible because there still 
does not exist a firm definition of what 
pornography is. 

"The local laws use terms like of- 
fensive and 'in poor taste,' but whose 
authority do we go by? " Gray asked. 

"The general public cannot decide 



what is offensive. Indiana is a con- 
servative state, but Fort Wayne is a 
much more conservative city than 
Bloomington," Graysaid. 

Rager said that pornography should 
be "banned completely. There would 
still be a black market, but at least we 
would have laws and could take ac- 
tion." 

Gray and Beams disagreed. "People 
must be educated. They must be 
willing to change their perceptions. 
People want pornography, but they 
must be made to realize that it is 
inaccurate and unrealistic. The basic 
saleable fact of pornography is that it 
can seem real, not a separate reality, 
but just an exaggeration of present 
reality," Beamssaid. 

Some defenders of pornography say 
it provides a catharsis for feelings that 
cannot be expressed in other ways. Or 
that it provides a calming, fantasy 
escape, much the same way as some 
art. Indeed, some works that we now 
consider great art, such as Whitman's 
"Leaves of Grass," were considered 
pornography at one time. 

"Art should not be banned. , The 
context is sexual arousal," Roger said. 

"Pornography isnol meant to have a 
calming effect. It is meant to incite 



men to action. Pornography provides 
no calming effect," Graysaid. 

"There is nothing wrong with the 
nude body, but we should look at what 
the body is being used for. If Monet had 
painted nudes that were tied up we 
probably wouldn't see much of Monet 
in museums today," shesaid. 

"We have to look beneath the sur- 
face. Art uses the sexual act for 
analogy and imagery, pornography 
stops at the act," shesaid. 

Pornography is often classed with 
gambling and marijuana use as 
"victimless crimes." 

"Women and children are the vic- 
tims, men the aggressors," Rager 
said. 

Gray agreed. "The women in those 
books and movies are not the victims, 1 
am. There are not immediate, obvious 
results. Men do not read "Hustler" and 
go right out and rape someone. It's 
more subtle and dangerous than that. 
Men don't have a meter on the side of 
their heads to show how much is 
dangerous and how much they can 
handle. And the pornographic 
magazine doesn't have a label from 
the surgeon general," she said. 

But men may be victims as well. 

"Pornography provides a sick role 
model of male power and female 
submission. This can create feelings of 
self dissatisfaction in the male. A 
feeling that he is missing the boat. Men 
become frustrated when given this 
unattainable image of a man who can 
(through the use of time-lapse 
photography in a film) satisfy women 
after woman without taking a break," 
Beamssaid. 

Whatever the problems and 
whomever the victims, pornography 
continues to grind along. By many 
accounts its annual revenues are in the 
double billion figure. It continues to 
open new markets and expand in the 
same way as any other enterprise. 

So what should one look for on that 
next shopping trip? "The newest 
trends seem to be in family porn, with 
everyone — mother, father, sister, and 
brother — getting into the act " Gray 
said. 

"More violence, chains, and bond 
age," Roger said. 

"More of the subtle forms in ads. 
Increasing use of children as sexual 
objects. Pornography will respond to 
what people want," Beamssaid. 



appeal a grade would be for the student 
to approach the instructor. 

If the student is not satisfied with the 
results with this meeting, the student 
then would go on to the second step. At 
this level, the student would approach 
the department or division chairman. 
The chairman would assist the student 
in processing his appeal to the ap- 
propriate department or division 
committee. This committee would then 
makeadecision. 

Should the student still be unsatisfied, 
he would then address the dean or 
coordinator of the school or unit from 
which the grade came. The dean or 
coordinator would present the case to 
the standing grade appeals committee, 
consisting of seven regular faculty 
members. 

The committee would decide whether 
to hear the case, depending if there was 
sufficient reason for further con- 
sideration of the student's appeal. If 
they decided to hear the case, they 
would make a decision which would be 
final. 

Svoboda said that this proposed 
policy is "both fair to students and 
faculty." 

According to Kenworthy, grade 
appeals are quite few. "I have only 
heard and decided six cases in the last 



Gambling exists in city 



' ' We just don 'I have (he manpower lo provide officers 
to investigate the gambling houses ..." Lloyd Ellis, Fort 
Wayne police vice and narcotics division. 



Although Indiana steadfastly 
refuses to legalize gambling, that 
doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Almost 
as old as brothels, the after hour 
gambling houses continue to thrive. 
In recent weeks a Fort Wayne man, 
Earl Underwood, was shot to death 
at one such house in an argument 
over a _diee game. 

The house, in operation for years, 
opens its doors after bars and night 
clubs haveclosed down for the night. 

Along the unlit street cars are 
parked tight, almost 50 on any 
weekend night. Just outside the 
house young men patrol, scouting 
for any signs of trouble. Police raids 
are rare, but the threat exists. 

Inside it's standing room only. In 
the main room beer and half pints of 
whiskey are sold illegally. 

Breaking through the fog of smoke 
and the smell of sweat, couples 
stagger and dance wildly to the loud 
thumping disco music that causes 
the walls to vibrate. 

Off in a side room, about 10 men 
and a young woman surround a dice 
table. The man rolling the dice pulls 
what seems an endless amount of 
dollar bills from the pockets of bis 
black velveteen suit. He wins two or 
three rolls right away, but then loses 
the next 10. Relentlessly he keeps 
laying his money down, determined 
to go home a winner. 

In still another room, two men are 
locked in a game of blackjack. At a 
table surrounded by an attentive 
audience, a hustler named Bob is 
hard at work dealing the cards. 
Opposite him sits a balding, middle- 
aged man named Mike. Many of the 
onlookers whisper behind his back 
calling him a sucker. With his eyes 
half shut and speech slurred, Mike is 
clearly drunk. 

With each of Bob's deals. Mike 
lays out another £20 bill. But Mike Is 
making a very big mistake. He 
continues to watch his own cards 
being laid and not the dealer's 

With each card laid Bob stops to 
see what he has given himself, which 
isn't difficult since the cards are 
marked. When Bob sees a card he 
doesn't want, he quickly slips it into 
the wad of S20 bills he holds, un- 
noticed by Mike. 

According to the rules of black- 
jack, if a player gets an ace and a 
face card, he or she receives double 
in return for the amount that's bet. 
Because of his drunkenness, Mike 
doesn't notice Bob cheating him by 
giving him back the original -.:&gt;&gt; 
instead of S40. 

Bob is good at what he does. 
Barely a moment goes by when he 
isn't talking to Mike or joking with 
the crowd around him. At one point, 
Bob lets Mike win a few hands. Bob 
acts mad, gets up and stalks off, only 
to return minutes later to win back 
his money and more. It's all a ploy to 
keep Mike betting. 

In just over an hour, Bob wins 
more than $800 from Mike. Mike, 
now out of cash, turns lo a friend 
who has patiently been watching the 
game. The well-dressed man agrees 
to cash a $500 check for Mike so he 
can continue lo play. Bob wilt later 
tip the man a percentage of his 



winnings. It's Bob's way of saying 
thanks for keeping Mike supplied 
with money. 

As the game goes on, the owner of 
the gambling house frequently 
walks about chatting with the 
customers and supplying cases of 
beer to the bar. He wants to make 
sure control is maintained. This is 
his livelihood and he wants the 
paying customers to return. He eyes 
anyone he doesn't recognize 
suspiciously. He's wary of anyone 
who might be connected with the 
law; at his age he doesn't need to be 
stuck in jail again. 

He is well known by the police, and 
greets officers who patrol the neigh- 
borhood warmly. And the officers 
will exchange hell as, or say, 
"You're not running crap tables are 
you?" 

"No, I don't do that any more. It 
takes too much out of an old black 
man like myself," the owner 
responds. And the police continue 
their patrol. 

But if the after hour gambling 
houses are illegal, why aren't the 
authorities closing them down? Why 
isn't the old man being charged with 
promoting gambling, or selling 
liquor without a license? Or why 
aren't hustlers like Bob being 
convicted for unlawful or 
professional gambling? 

"It takes a lot of money and a lot of 
time," stated Lieutenant Lloyd Ellis 
of the Fort Wayne Police, Vice and 
Narcotics Division. "We just don't 
have the manpower to provide of- 
ficers to investigate gambling 
houses alone." 

Ellis explained that to convict 
someone of professional gambling 
was tougher than it might seem. On 
federal charges you would have to 
prove someone was bringing in 
$5,000 a week, plus proving five or 
more people were involved. On the 
local level, proof has to be shown a 
person maintained a living from 
gambling alone. 

"It's pretty easy for a person to 
claim he or she works part-time at a 
bar or restaurant and get someone 
to cover up for them," added Ellis. 

So what would the police need to 
crack down on the gambling houses 
in Fort Wayne? 

Ellis emphasized that his 
department didn't have the use of 
wire tap, or full time attorneys. "A 
lot of gambling transactions and 
money is exchanged over the phone. 
Especially when you deal with the 
bookies. So without the modern 
investigative equipment to provide 
the proof, you're not going to get 
many convictions, "Ellis said. 

"When you consider the amount of 
time an undercover officer spends 
collecting proof, and the amount of 
money spent to conduct the in- 
vestigation, plus sending the case 
through the criminal justice system, 
it's simply not worth it," he said. 

Court dockets show that Allen 
County Superior Court over the past 
two years has sentenced only one 
Fort Wayne man to spend time 
behind bars. He is currently serving 
two consecutive two-year terms at 
West ville Correctional Center. 

The standard sentence a majority 
of offenders received was a 
suspended sentence ranging from 
one to two years, and a $500 fine, 
records show.

•■Congratulations!" to each of the more 
tbanl, 300 students gradual ing May 13, 

We hope that when you luok back on the 
years you've spent at IPFW you'll look back 
on them fondly. 

Sure, you'll remember the things you 
didn't like here — the parking hassles, the 
few "bad" courses you might have taken, or 
the sometimes "cold" atmosphere of a 
commuter campus, 

But, even more than those things, you'll 
remember the good things about IPFW ... 

... The fine faculty The majority of IPFW's 
faculty members are well qualified and 
capable instructors. Most care about their 
students as individuals rather than numbers. 
The forward- looking administration 
Although IPFW's administrators are facing 
budget pinches, they continue to strive for 
the highest quality in education for students 
here. Their top priority is to maintain IP- 
FW's excellent faculty, staff and services. 

. . The hard-working staff IPFW's 
custodians, grounds people, office workers, 
postal employees and police force keep 
IPFW running smoothly. They're dedicated 
individuals who care about how the campus 
looks and functions.

But attitudes similar lo 
those taken by Fort Wayne 
officials prevails nationally 
According to a congressional 
report released in 1976, 
American cities tend to 
downplay the importance o( 
professional gambling as a 
felony 

For example, between 1969 
and 1974 Chicago Police 
made 36,207 arrests for 
gambling. Only 6 percent 

The report also showed 
gambling was a pastime of 
two-thirds of the American 
people and approved by 
nearly 80 percent But 
perhaps more importantly, it 
reported that the American 
public would rather see the 
police departments devote 
their time to investigating 
violent crimes such as theft 
or rape Gambling simply 
was not considered a 
priority-

them hold down jobs, raise families and 
maintain households while working toward 
their degrees They're here not merely to be 
"in college" but because they realize the 
value of higher education. 

The campus grounds. The IPFW mam 
campus, with its limestone and br.. k 
buildings, lush, well-kept lawns and iree- 
lined walkways, is beautiful. It's a source of 
pride to all studen" - past, present and 
future. 

The Arts School campus on Berry St. 
provides a warm, if quaint, atmosphere 
where students become acquainted with the 
beauty of life as well as that of art. 

The'BarrSl DGTS campus, although it's 
housed ir an old building, provides excellent 
lea mini; facilities in many practical fields. 

Yes its easy to overlook the many good 
thing: about IPFW — especially when you're 
still struggling to finish your degree 
prog am. 

We congratulate those of you who have 
accomplished your goals here. 

We're confident that in the years lo come 
you will took back fondly and say, 
"Congratulations, IPFW, for what you are 
and thank you for what you've given me."

felt about gambling as a 
private citizen. "I think it 
should be legalized. 
Especially with all the 
budget cutting the President 
is doing. Indiana could 
subsidize some of its 
programs with taxes levied 
against the gambling 
houses," hesaid. 

Lietuenant Ellis said if 
gambling was made legal in 
Indiana, police would have 
an easier time running 
hustlers and cheats like Bob

"With no moi

say that drug trafficking was 
the Fort Wayne Vice Squad's 
main concern 'With

as it seems to be, gambling 
and the gambling houses are 
continue being a 
moral issue."

IU jazz season ends 



By GK ETCH EN HOLODICK 
Staff Writer 

The IU Jazz Ensemble, 
along wilh the Fori Wayje 
Community Jazz Band and 
the IU Jazz Combo, per- 
formed (heir last concert of 
(he year last Tuesday. The 
attendance was fair, and 
everyone there seemed to 
enjoy the performance. 

The first band to perform 
was the Fort Wayne Com- 
munity Jazz Band, con- 
sisting of a few high school 
students, musicians from 
around the area, and a few

Bv NANCY SLICK 
Slaff Writer 

The Fort Wayne Ballet, 
which is celebrating its lith 
anniversary (his year, gave 
a delight ful spring per- 
formance last weekend at 
the Performing Arts Center. 
The show included the work 
of artists Dace Dmdonis and 
William Carter 

Dindoms has done ex- 
tensive work with the Joliet 
Ballet Society and is the 
assistant artistic director 
for the Indianapolis Ballel 
Theatre For this show, she 
choreographed a colorful 
ballet of kaleidoscopic 
movement entitled 

"Tapestries," which was 
inspired by medieval 
tapestries and paintings. The 
dance was unbelievably 
graceful. 



Choreographed by guest 
artisl-in-residence Mr. 
Williams, were the Brahms 
waltzes and his solo number. 
"Allegrins " The waltzes, 
beautiful company pieces 
accompanied by Dorothy 
Escosa, were inspired by the 
memory of Isadora Duncan 

Williams, who has worked 
wilh Jerome Robbins, 
George Balanchine and 
Martha Graham, has earned 
a reputation as a dance 
virtuoso. In "Allegrias," he 
demonstrated his great 
talent for Spanish flamenco 
dancing 

The closing "Silhouettes" 
was choreographed by the 
Fort Wayne Ballet's artistic 
director, James Franklin. It 
provided an overview of 
American musical theatre of , 
the past 70 years. Some 



featured songs were from "A 
Chorus Line." "Oklahoma." 
"West Side Story" and 
"Annie." A number from 
"Porgy and Bess" was sung 
by soprano Janice Further 
and accompanied by harpist 
Nancy Morse. 

Other pieces included in 
the program were the 
dramalic solo "The Dying 
Swan," performed by Janet 
Parke and the vibrant lap 
dance performed by Arlene 
Kennedy. Cory Chenault was 
featured throughout the 
show. 

The entire show had a 
wonderful variety of dance 
forms and was thoroughly 
enjoyable but unfortunately 
poorly attended. Too many 
people missed out on a very 
entertaining evening. 



The Communicator is 
looking for an ambitious, 
bright, and dedicated writer 
with artistic sensibilities to 
betheArts Editor for the fall 
semester. 

For an interview ap- 
pointment, call 482-5565, or

performers from Hie 1L : 
band. Though this band only 
gels a chance to practice 
once a week, they did a 
pretty good job. A highlight 
of their performance was 
their rendition of Weather 
Report's "Birdland." 

The next band to come on 
was the IU Jazz Combo. This 
group just started this year, 
but its success is obvious — it 
will become a credit course 
next year. The IU Jazz 
Combo is Gary Gerke on 
guitar, Owen McClellend on 
saxophone, Tom Frye on 
trumpet, Bill Jackson on 
bass, Steve Billings on 
trombone, Scott Weltner on 
drums, and David La t chaw 
on piano. 

All of the songs performed 
were arranged by members 
in the combo. Tom Frye 
arranged Miles Davis' 
"Freddy the Freeloader" 
and Gary Gerke arranged 
Chick Corea's "Sea Jour- 
ney" All of the : 



played very well, but the 
piano player must be given 
special tribute for a fine 
performance, 

The IU Jazz Ensemble 
performed Phil Wood's 
"Flatjack Willie." Duke 
Ellington's "Concerto for 
Cootie." and "Heliopolis" by 
Spyro Gyra. Tom Frye was 
excellent as the featured 
soloist in "Concerto for 
Cootie." The rock rhythms 
accentuated during 
"Heliopolis" were out- 
standing, and all around, the 
band seemed really positive 
and loose. They appeared to 
be comfortable and enjoying 
themselves, This was made 
possible in great part by the 
conductor, John Branam. 
The band showed marked 
improvement over the first 
concert this semester, 

The performance had a lot 
of variety and the superb 
insl rumentals went over

Tune in to 'As Heaven 's Gate Opens 9 

ByMIKEGEFFEN on showing the texture of life th e emotions. II the nim "1 thought he was pretty ahit-" -*• 



ByMIKEGEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

It's time now for another 
episode of "As 'Heaven's 
Gate' Opens," or "Michael 
Cimino, Michael Cimino." 

At the end of the last 
episode our hero was 
feverishly working on re- 
editing and redubbing the 
film after it opened and 
closed in New York in one 
day. Battling negative 
publicity, he is now 
anxiously awaiting the 
verdict from the head of 
United Artists. As today's 
episode begins, the phone 
rings. 

"Mike, I've just seen the 
new version of 'Heaven's 
Gate.' The good news is that 
you've lightened it upquitea 
bit, polished up the rough 
edges, and improved the film 
immensely. The bad news is 
that I doubt we'll break 
even." 

"What do you mean?" 

"You spend loo much lime 



on showing the texture of life 
in the west, but not enough 
time on the characters. It's 
not that Vilmos Zigmond's 
Sepia-toned cinematography 
isn't good, but don't you 
think that the panoramic 
shots could be trimmed?" 

"But I thought those shots 
added to the power of the 
film." 

"Tell me Mike, do you 
honestly believe that 
showing three minutes of 
people roller skating in the 
old west adds to the power of 
the film?" 

"Those scenes are sup- 
posed to show how the 
townspeople spent their 
leisure time." 

"Your basic idea is fine, 
this is the first film that's 
dealt with the Johnson 
County Wars, and the part of 
the film that deals with the 
immigrants versus the 
businessmen is brilliant 
filmmaking. Much of it is 
strong, and it cuts right to 



the emotions. 11 the tilm 
stuck to thai, it would have 
been magnificent. Your 
point that America was 
founded on the immigrants' 
blood is well taken, but as it 
is, there's simply not enough 
characterdevelopment." 

"1 always thought that was 
the film's strongest point." 

"Maybe the problem's not 
in the characters so much as 
in the casting. Isabelle 
Huppert, Christopher 
Walken, Sam Waterson and 
John Hurt are all fine. They 
give good performances; I 
don't think the problem's 
with them. But, really Mike, 
do you honestly think that 
Kris Kristofferson is that big 
a box office draw? He's a 
mediocre singer at best, and 
to put as much faith in him 
as an actor as you did ruins 
the film. He doesn't have the 
intensity that will have a 
scene the way DeNiro did in 
'The Deer Hunter.'" 



1 thought he was pretty 
good." 

"Is that why you billed his 
name above yours? " 

"No, he promised to in- 
troduce me to Rita 
Coolidge." 

"Mike, I know you're a big 
fan of hers, but that is 
ridiculous. There's 
something else about the 
billing that bothers me. 
Don't you think that billing 
your name above the tille is 
a little presumptious? Face 
it Mike, you're a . fine 
director, for small films, but 
you're not in the same league 
with a Coppola, Kubrick or 
Capra. You've only made 
three films. Granted one of 
them won some Oscars, but 
that is no reason to bill 
yourself like that. Face it, 
you're not that good a 
director." 

"Then why did you give all 
that money?" 

"Our psychic, Tamara 
Rand, said the film would be 



"Oh, that explains quite a 
few things." 

"Look Mike, 'Heaven's 
Gate' is not thai bad a film. 
In fact, some of it is very 
good, better than 'The Deer 
Hunter' If this was the 
version thai first came out I 
have no doubt that critics 
would be hailing it as a 
masterpiece," 

"Bull think..." 

"That's what got us into 
this problem in the first 
place, your thinking. The 
fatal facts are that the Rim 
still has a lot 6f dead weight, 
it has no bankable stars, (we 
could have sold it if you had 
Burt Reynolds, Barbra 
Streisand and John Travolta 
in it) and westerns just 
aren't profitable anymore. I 
guarantee it won't play for 
more than two weeks in Fort 
Wayne, and both you and I 
know that Fort Wayne is 
crucial to the midwestem 
market. If a film makes it in 
Fort Wayne, it will do well in 



the rest of the midwest. The 
painful fact is, Mike, we've 
got a white elephant on our 
hands." 

"I've just had a brain- 
storm. Pull the film from 
release and I can get it down 
to 97 minules. That would 
pick up the pace." 

"1 don't know, Mike." 

"Please, this Is my career 
we're talkingabout. I know if 
I can get it down to 97 
minules, everything will 
workout." 

"I'll talk it over with 
Transamerica and get back 
to you." 

Will Michael Cimino be 
able to cut "Heaven's Gate" 
down to 97 minutes and save 
his career? Will he ever be 
more than a hack director 
with one hit under his bell? 
Who cares? For the answers 
to these insipid questions, 
tune in to the next episode of 
"As 'Heaven's Gate' Opens" 
or "Michael Cimino, Michael

Direct Student Loan (made after October 1 , 1975) hanging 
over your head, consider spending a couple of yeSrs in 
the Army. 

If you train for certain specialties, the government will 
release you from 1/3 of your indebtedness (or $1,500, which- 
ever is greater) for each year of aenve duty 

Obviously, a three-year enlistment would eliminate 
100% of your indebtedness. But you may prefer to take a 
shorter route and sign up under the Army's two-year enlist- 
ment option (and put 2/3 of your debt behind you) 

Or you might want to join the Army Reserve !t you 
qualify, as a Reservist you can stay home, get paid for your 
active duty, and receive 15% loan forgiveness (or $500, 
whichever is greater) for each year you serve 

But we're not just offering you loan forgiveness With 
your education, you can probably qualify for a higher rank 
ana pay grade. You'll have your choice of many sophis- 
ticated Army skills. 

And you may be eligible tor generous monetary educa- 
tional incentives 

TWO-FOR-ONE SAVINGS PLAN 

If your dream is to continue your educatii in a &gt;me day, 
joining the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program can 
bring that day closer. 



In fact, in just two years you can accumulate up to 
$9,200 for grad school. (Only the Army can offer you a two- 
year enlistment I 

It's not a loan, so you II never have to worry about 
making payments. It's simply a savings program between you 
and the government. 

If you save between $25 
and $100 of your monthly 

Army pay, the government will 
match that amount two- 
for-one On top of that, you 
might qualify lor an exclusive 
Army educational incentive 
of $2,000. (Longer enlistments 
can result in higher incentives) 
And you can participate in 
VEAP at the same tunc yi iu re 
receiving loan forgiveness 
;o back to school with 2/3 ci 
,200 for your education ahead

When finals are ap- 
proaching and the only thing 
you can think about is how 
you're going to get five 
papers written, two books 
read and three projects 
finished in one week, it's a 
little difficult to think of 
spending your summer in a 
classroom. You're a rare 
bird in academia if you have 
everything all wrapped up 
and all your pencils sharp- 
ened waiting for the prof to 
hand out those little, icy-blue 
exam books. 

But remember, profs were 
like us, yes,- once upon a 
time. You can't tell me they 
never procrastinated, never 
sweated a deadline, never 
faced the reckoning day. 

What this means is they 
know us a little better than 
we might think. Yes, they 
know the tricks, the 
petitions, the "personal 
problems," and how many 
times you had to cook for 
your sick mother. 

But they're witling to give 
us another chance. Some 
have even given up wild and 
exotic summer trips to 
Russia and Saudi Arabia to 
be on hand at 1PPW and 
teach us little darlings 
something more in our great 
thirst for knowledge. And 



I'm taking time out from 
cramming for my five 
papers, two books and three 
projects to tell you the big 
news about summer classes. 

Imagine reading bawdy 
18th century satire and 
comedy while you watch the 
boats go by on Lake George. 
Or step into the mind of 
Cervantes, who watched his 
boats go by in 15th century 
Spain. Transform your 
summer cottage into a 
Copernican planetarium and 
study the stars while taking 
Astronomy 100, or better yet, 
Stellar Astronomy, A105. 

While you have your cook- 
outs, you can impress your 
father with your new-found 
political theories gained 
solidly through Introduction 
lo American Politics or 
Political Theory. Obtain a 
lay-about grandiloquence as 
you spout intimate 
knowledge of Middle 
Eastern politics(Y362). 

If you have younger 
brothers and sisters and 
they're bugging you because 
they have nothing to do, 
clean out the kitchen of its 
pots and pans, spoons and 
salt shakers and dazzle (hem

Summertime means suntime. But for anyone out to get a 
tan, there's more to it than just lying out in the yard. 

Fort Wayne dermatologist Dr. Alan Gilbert recommends 
the sensible approach to sunbathing, starting with a half hour 
exposure on the first day out, then increasing each sub- 
sequent day's tanning by 20 to 25 minutes. 

Some form of applied protection is advisable, initially with 
the use of a sunscreen. Extensive testing has been done on 
the levels of SPF's (sun protecting factors) contained in 
suncreens, said Gilbert, with No. 15 being an almost total sun 
blockage. Fair skinned people should use a sunscreen with an 
SPF in the 10 to 12 range, medium complexioned — ap 
proximately eight, and those with darker skin — about a four. 

The most dangerous rays of the sun occur between the 
hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun's heat is naturally 
at its hottest and the chances of sunburn are increased. 

Dr. Gilbert recommends a prescription cream containing 
cortisone as the best and quickest way to relieve minor 
sunburn pain. 

Medical studies have determined there is a definite 
relation between sun exposure, over a long period of time 
and skin cancer, said Gilbert. The fairer the skin is, the 
higher the risk for skin diseases like cancer to occur. Other 
long term side effects of prolonged sun exposure can be 
extensive drying out and premature wrinkling of the skin.

in 42 days — all for less than 
$20 a day, meals and over- 
night expenses included.

made possible through 
American Youth Hostels 
(AYHl, a nonprofit 
organization which has been 
operating since 1934. The 
group's purpose, in part, Is to 
provide inexpensive travel 
via hosteling — sharing 
living expenses and over- 
night accomodations. 
Membership is open to

The hostels are usually 
campgrounds, hotels, lodges 
or other buildings which 
have been converted to 
dormitory-style housing, 
said Tom Hill, a travel 
coordinator for AYH, From 
two to eight people stay 



overnight in a room and use 
communal facilities. 
Everyone is expected to help 
with the cooking and 
cleaning. "They share the 
ride and share the load," Hill 
said. 

Almost all trips, mostly in 
this country although 
several are lo foreign 
countries, are organized as 
bicycle tours. Hill said about 
35-40 miles are covered each 
day at a 10 m.p.h. pace. 
"That's three lo four hours of 
cycling," he said, "with lots 
of stops." He said par-

Job could highlight summer 



ByELLlEWOLLMAN

Being a lour guide on a 
riverboat cruise, flagging for 
a construction company, or 
mowing the lawn at a 
cemetery are just a few of 
the "out-of-the-ordinary" 
summer jobs in Fort Wayne. 

The riverboat cruise, 
sponsored by the Historic 
Fort Wayne Corp., takes 
passengers on a scenic trip 
through the Fori Wayne 
rivers, with a tour guide 
pointing out the historic 
spots along the river banks. 
The tour guide uses a 
prepared script and works 
only the weekends. Several 
of these positions will go to 
students that have already 
been interviewed through 
Ihe Job Location Service on 
campus. 

As for mowing and 
trimming work at the 
cemetery, it may sound a bit 
dreary, but Thomas Pehlke, 
Executive Director of 
Lin den wood Cemetery, said 
that students are some of the 
best workers he has. He said 
thai after a year of studying 
and sitting in class, students 
are raring to go and enjoy 
the outside work. And with 
175 acres at Linden wood, 
there's a lot to mow. 

Flagging for a con- 
struction company is a 
position many more women 
are becoming involved in. 
This involves controlling 
traffic out on the highway. 



Joyce Spider, Equal 
Employment Opportunity- 
Officer at Brooks Con- 
struction Co., Inc., said that 
women are not only working 
in flagging positions these 
days, but are also getting 
more involved in common 
laborer's work in con- 
struction. 

If students are interested 
in summer employment, 
they should definitely drop 
by the Job Location Service, 
said Anne Hoover, co- 
coordinator. Some of their 
available job listings are for 
computer operators, bank 
clerks, babysitters, waiters 
and waitresses, cashiers, 
salespeople, and clerical 
workers. 

Listings also included a 
position as lifeguard and 
activities director at 
Jellystone Campground in 
Pierceton, doorman al the 
Great Wall Restaurant, and 
a telephone solicitor for 
Arthur Murray Dance 
Studios. 

Students should also check 
with temporary employment 
agencies as a source of 
summer employment. There 
are several listed in the 
yellow pages. 

Anne Hoover, co- 
coordinator of the Job 
Location Service, offered Ihe 
following tips when looking 
for a summer job:

Racing cars at Southtown 
provoke youthful thoughts 



By WAYNE STEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

Old lovers die hard. 

In by-gone days of twenty- 
live-cents- a -gallon gasoline 
our mistresses reposed in 
sequin gowns of melal-flake 
lacquer Wrapped in colors 
like "Candy Apple Red," 
"Electric Blue," and "Hot 
Tangerine Orange." they 
gazed longingly back at us 
from the six page layouts of 
"Hot Rod" and "Rod and 
Custom." 

Days a( the races were 
capped by nights of eruisin' 
I own They spoke to us 
through throaty chrome 
pipes as they crouched in the 
dark corners or ran just 
ahead down the streets. The 
most beautiful of them ait 
had just screamed away 
from us as we pulled up to 
(he red light. 

Going to aulo shows was 
heaven and everyone was 
building a dream in his own 
backyard 

We were (if lee n years old 
.Hid did iiui Rc-t girls because. 
Frankly, we smelled funny 
Bui who needed girls? We 
had cars 

And this past weekend 
Southtown Mall had cars. 
The cars we used to dream of 
driving as we revved our 
ramshackle Chevys down 
Mam Street, heading flat out 
for the Burger Chef and 
singing rock music as it 
sizzled through the exposed 
wires of jerry-rigged car 
stereos. 

Race cars are a cut above 
even Ihe hottest street rod 
and race cars were 
displayed down Ihe Mall. 
Race cars lined up like hot 
summer herself. The smell 



of gas and exotic fuels could 
almost be (ell on the longue. 

Perhaps the star of the 
show was a 1981 Indy 500 car 
owned locally by Bob Gaby. 
The 1971 Cayote was 
originally pari of A.J Foyt's 
stable bui has been com- 
pletely rebuilt by the present 
owner. 

Driving chores are to be 
handled by another Fort 
Wayne native. Steve Ball. 
The 30-ycar-old Ball started 
driving midget cars four 
years ago and progressed to 
ihe larger sprint cars last 
year Ball would have been a 
rookie at the 500 this May but 
had problems getting a 
sponsor for the car. 

"We still don't have a full 
time sponsor for the car and 
because of (hat I couldn't run 
in rookie orientation in 
April," Ballsaid. 

Gaby can still run the car 
but the driver's spot is still 
open, if anyone is a budding 
race driver 

"Without a sponsor we can 
run the car as long as we 
don't have any major break- 
downs. If we can qualify 
right away and then jusl let 
her sit for the rest of May. 
we'll be in good shape," Ball 
said. 

Walking through a 
medium sized crowd of 
railbirds, where a few people 
looked pretty knowledgeable 
and the rest tried awfully 
hard, the next car in line was 
a very clean orange and 
yellow Firebird. This was 
the A.R.C.A. Grand 
Nationals champion No. 11, 
formerly owned by Bobby 
Allison. 

A couple of late model 
stock cars were on display. 



among Ihem is the i98&lt;i Baer 
Field champ, a Camaro 
owned by Joe Wallace. 

There were two semi-late 
model slockers at 
Southtown. One of them, 
painted a -comparatively 
sedate brown and tan, wore 
the number 1. Owner Lee 
Hegerfcld must have been 
very optimistic about (he 
coming season. 

For Ihe beginner, there 
were a couple of street stock 
class racers. 

One of them was especially 
interesting because it 
provided suggested readings 
Tor fans and fellow com- 
petitors. 

The blue and gold 1970 
Chevelle proclaimed "Jesus 
is Coming" on its sides and 
had Luke 21 :33 written on the 
hood. After it passed, the 
beaten foe could be consoled 
by looking al John 3; 16 

Afterwards, walking back 
through Ihe parking lot one 
couldn't help notice that 
today, the plain-janes have 
taken our lovers away. Eye 
pleasing curves have given 
way to economy -plea sing 
boxes in car lots 
everywhere 

R.P.M.'s have become 
M.P.G.'s and our wild 
flames of the 50's through 
early 70s have become the 
practical housewives of the 
80's. 

Now, confined to race- 
tracks, we see them only as 
blurs on a straightaway or 
refractions on a turn. It was 
good lo be able to get close to 
them again, to lovingly eye 
the curves and pal the 



Skydiving gains popularity 



By TIMOTHY J. ROSS 
Sports Editor 

The engines rev and the 
plane taxis onto the grass 
airstrip — il is too late for 
anything except maybe a 
short prayer. 

A prayer that will 
momentarily be interrupted 
by a lump rising in Ihe throat 
as the wheels of Ihe plane 
leave the ground and is then 
lost in a mixture of fear and 
excitement 

After climbing steadily for 
a few minutes, the plane 
levels off at 3000 feel, the 
door is flung open, and out 
pops some crazy guy lhat 
thinks he can defy the laws of 
gravity — a skydiver. 

These crazy people are 
becoming more and more 
numerous as the sport of 
ftydiving gains popularity. 



In any sport the beginner 
must first be taught the 
basics before he can play the 
game; skydiving is the 
same 

Currently there are two 
locations close to Fort 
Wayne (hal (each the basics 
in skydiving, Paris Port at 
Tocsin and Mentone At the 
jump sites or drop zones, 
instructors will leach an 
individual how to jump, 
guide the parachute, and 
land. 

The ground lesson usually 
takes four to five hours. 

The individual is then 
outfitted, taken up, and 
dropped from the plane, said 
IPFW student, pilot, and 
skydiver John Krasienko. 

The first several jumps 
are made with a static line— 
a line connected to the plane 



that opens the parachute. 
Usually after five jumps an 
individual makes a clearent 
pull — he pulls the cord 
himself — and he is in 
complete control. 

Student jumps are made at 
3000 feel, and experienced 
jumpers can jump from 
15,000 feet, but according to 
Krasienko the average jump 
is at 7500 feet. In any event 
the parachute should be 
deployedataoOOfeet. 

"It's an experience thai 
everyone has lo try; it's 
something that can't be 
described lo others," said 
Krasienko. 

When a diver begins 
making clearent pulls, he 
also, in most cases, begins to 
free fall before he opens his 
parachute. A person can 
literally learn to fly, said 



Komets face competition 
both on and off the ice 



ByMIKEFRANKE 
Chief Reporter 

This season for the Fort 
Wayne Komets was very 
similar to the 1979- 
80 campaign. The learn 
started out fast and then 
faded Attendance at the 
Coliseum dropped last year, 
and this season the situation 
became worse 

In years past the Komets 
drew very well. Saturday 
night games attracted 5,000 
fans on a regular basis, and 
Wednesday nights broughl 
3.500 fans through ihe 
turnstiles 

At this time the Komets 
are in quest of the Inter- 
national Hockey League's 
Turner Cup Championship. 

The last lime the Coliseum 
(rophy case held (he Turner 
Cup award was after the 
1972-73 season, when Komel 
Hockey lever was strong, 
and the learn was even 
better. Players like Bob 
FUchner. Terry Pembroke. 
Don Atchison and Robbie 
Irons were household names 
Hockey games drew big 
crowds al (he Coliseum 
Everyone wanted lo see the 
K sin action. 

As the years rolled by the 
Komets were still playing a 
good brand of hockey, and 
the attendance al Ihe 
Coliseum was better than 
any team's in the league. 

Then came the lale 
seventies The National 
Hockey League expanded, 
mi! then &lt;rxparided again, lo 
Ihe present twenty -one learn 
league Players of quality 
become scarce in the I H.L. 
The economic situation was 



bad all over the League. 

Fort Wayne was hit hard, 
as companies began laying 
off employees, and some 
even packed up and moved 
out of the city. With the 
rising prices the Komets 
were forced to raise their 
own ticket prices to the 
current $5,50 I Lower arena) 
and W.S0 ( Upper arena 1 , just 
to stay one step ahead of the 
bill collectors. 

Attendance began to fall 
off drastically last year and 
that trend continued 
throughout this season. 
Things got so bad that an 
opening round playoff game 
with Milwaukee drew only 
1,700 fans, and a crowd of 
only 3,300 showed up for a 
Friday night game 

What's been the reason for 
the attendance decline in the 
past couple of years? Komet 
play-by-play man Bob Chase 
said, "the economic 
situation in the area has been 
a problem, but we've go( 
some work to do loo." Chase 
said it was time to 
rediscover ihe hockey fans in 
Fort Wayne, even if it means 
going back to the basics and 
leaching a new generation of 
fans "We've been in the city 
for 29 years, but we still can't 
call ourselves a fixture," 
said Chase 

Chase also believes lhat 
television has been a lactor 
in the declining attendance 
figures. Chase said, "Cable 
Television has hurt us loo 
People can slay home and be 
entertained for a fairly 
reasonable, price." 

As far as the [.H.L and Ihe 
Komets are concerned. 



Chase has an optimistic 
viewpoint on both, despite 
Ihe fact lhat Toledo and Port 
Huron have decided to cease 
operations, at least for next 
season. 

"The league is in good 
shape elsewhere, because 
the learns are run by good 
people. Don't be surprised to 
see Port Huron and Toledo 
back in the league for the 
1982-83 season," explained 
Chase. Chase said one year 
should be long enough for 
those two franchises to 
straighten out organizational 
problems. 

Despite the club's poor 
attendance this season 
Chase said that the Komets 
are in good shape. "Il's been 
kind of a rough year for us, 
but we're not going 
anywhere We'll be around 
for awhile," he said. 

Over the past couple cf 
seasons it has been 
suggested by many that the 
Komets should get out of Ihe 
I H.L and place themselves 
in a higher ranking league, 
such as the Central Hockey 
League The Central League 
is just one step under the 
National League, so Ihe 
affiliated minor league learn 
would be almost completely 
controlled by the parent 
N.H.L. club Independen! 
ownership, such as is seen in 
Fort Wayne, would be a 
rarity in that type of 
situation. 

Would ihe Komels ever 
consider such a move -1 
Chase said, "I would hope 
that a situation like that 
would never arise, bul if 
push came lo shove, I sup- 
pose we'd have to."

Tennis team nears 
season's conclusion 



By KEVIN SMITH and 
TIMOTHY J. ROSS 

The IPFW men's tennis 
team will end its season this 
Saturday against Bluffton 
and Cedarvtlle, at Cedar- 
ville 

Although the season has 
been somewhat of a disap- 
pointment for the men's 
team. Coach Ben Becker 
regards the year as one of 
rebuilding and eagerly 
anticipates next season. 

Next season the whole 
tennis program should be 
elevated, said Becker He 
explained that the team 
would take the spring trip to 
Florida even if they (the 
members of the learn ) had to 
finance il with funds from 
their own pockets The trip 
would allow the team several 
preseason games that it 
lacks now It should benefit 
ihe (earn, said Becker. 

Members of the men's and 
women's tennis teams will 
be participating in several 
city tournaments during the 
summer to keep in shape and 
good form Two new indoor 
tennis courts in (he new gym 
will aid the team by allowing 
practice lo begin earlier than 



it would on the outdoor 
courts. 

Top seeded freshman 
Holden Maecker will be 
returning next season, but 
his sighls are set on the rest 
of thisseason. 

"I am looking forward lo 
next week's rematch," 
Maecker said in reference lo 
his victory over Bluffton's 
top seed, Eric Simcox Russ 
Carrol also defeated his 
Bluffton, Ohio opponent, 
Pete Yosl. The rest of the 
IPFW squad did not fair as 
well, however, as all bowed 
down to the superior Bluffton 
squad. 

The team also met Olivet 
last week in Michigan. IPFW 
carried only one victory in 
the singles matches; Dennis 
Graf defeated Steve 
Jackson. 

The women's team also 
played a few sets last week 
against St. Mary's of South 
Bend, bul their lack of 
practice time was evident as 
Ihey lost all of the matches. 

The men's tennis team will 
meel Taylor in its final home 
match on April 30, and will 
finish its season on May 2, at 
Cedarville.

The 1981 Tusker baseball 
season was going lo be a 
rebuilding year for coach 
Larry Windmiller and 
company. Windmiller knew 
lhat would be the case so he 
came prepared. 

Gone from last year's 
veteran pi(ching staff were 
Mike Lothamer, Joe Pea and 
Rick Genessi. This year's 
staff was comprised of 
newcomers with the ex- 
ception of lefthander Rick 
Stevens. 

Both the infield and out- 
field were anchored down by 
freshmen, with the exception 
of (wo infield positions. 

The outfield, which has 
been a problem area for the 
team all season has been 
made up of players who 
didn't have experience at 
those outfield positions. The 
outfield has also been 
decimated by injuries 
throughout the season. 

When the season opened 
coach Windmiller's roster 
was comprised of just 15 
players. It seems that a 
small roster would have its 
disadvantages, bul Wind- 
miller sees one positive 
aspect that makes any 
suffering worth it. 

"By keeping the rosier 
down I was able lo eliminate 
those players who had 
scheduling conflicts. 1 
wanted players who were 
going to show up all of the 
time," said Windmiller. 

In recent seasons the 



team's practices had been 
upset by players who didn't 
show up because of job 
commitments. There would 
be none of lhal this year 
Windmiller explained, "You 
cannot become accustomed 
lo your leammates when 
different people show up at 
practice every night," he 
said. 

The only real glaring 
problem (hat is seen with the 
small roster is that Ihe team 
lacks depth at most 
positions. This can create 
problems when Ihe team has 
back-to-back double headers. 

After staggering through a 
1-7 start the Tuskers began 
playing better baseball even 
though the results didn't 
show up in the Iinescore. 
Calcher Ron Dull said, "It 
took us time, but once we 
picked up some college play- 
ing experience we seemed 
lo loosen up a bit." 

Dull had Iwo hits in last 
Friday's 7-1 victory over 
Saint Francis. Dull scored 
the game's winning run in 
the opening inning, as he 
came home on a double by 
Ken Seltenright Mike 
Hollowell had three hits for 
Ihe Tuskers. 

Rick Stevens was brilliant 
on the mound as he tossed a 
two-hitter. Stevens went the 
distance, recording seven 
strikeouts That win gave the 
Tuskers a 6-13 record. 

On Saturday the Tuskers 
lost a doubleheader to 
DePauw by scores of 5-1 and 
M. Those losses dropped Ihe 



team's record to6-15. 

Even though this Tusker 
squad has struggled through 
the schedule thus far, there 
have been some positive in- 
dications that would forecast 
better things to come. 

Shortstop Mike Hollowell 
sel a IPFW record for assists 
in one season. He had 46 
after just fifteen games. 

The enlire infield has 
played very well defensively 
since the outset of the 
season, and the team's 
hitting has picked up con- 
siderably. 

Going into last week's 
games Ron Dull led the club 
with a .400 baiting average. 
Senior Barry Backer punch- 
ed in at .345 for the season 
thus far. 

The team is aware that 
these last few games of the 
season will be important to 
build character for next 
year. Even though Ihe 
victories haven't come as 
ofien as he'd like, Coach 
Windmiller is still looking 
forward to playing the 
remaining games. 

"I really enjoyed coaching 
this team. They've been a 
great bunch of guys. We 
seemed to do everything but 
win bailgames," Windmiller 
said. 

The Tuskers played 
Huntington College on 
Tuesday, and will face 
Marion at home on Saturday. 
The team will travel to Tri- 
State on Sunday and wind up 
the season on the road at 
Purdue.

Competition has begun 
sprouting up in various parts 
of Ihe country 

In Oklahoma al the end of 
June and (he beginning of 
July, a national competition 
referred to as a "boogie" by 
(he jumpers, will be held. 

The competition is as 
serious as the competition in 
the World Series, said Don 
Sprandel, a member of a 
four-man skydiving team. 
The other members of Lie 



Fort Wayne team are Steve 
Redding. Kevin Deininger. 
and Charlie Andrews. 

The "boogie" provides a 
chance for both group and 
individual competition. The 
categories include accuracy 
and style, and jumpers are 
judged on execution of a 
routine within a given time 
limit 

What drives these people 
to go thousands of feet into 
the air and then step from 
the plane into an empty sky 
— and even pay to do it? 

"Well, I always wanted to 
skydive, and doing 
something — anything in the 
air, I love it," said Sprandel. 

"Besides I feel more 
comfortable in the air than 
on Ihe ground," hesaid.

Remember the slory about 
the little train lhat thought it 
could? Well, the IPFW men's 
volleyball season progressed 
much the same as thai story 
— only without the happy 
ending. 

The Tuskers opened their 
second season of varsity 
competition by losing their 
first seven games, all 
against more-experienced, 
major-college teams. "I 
can't doit. I can't do il." 

Then the team began 
playing some schools closer 
to its own size. And they 
started winning, finishing 
third in two tournaments. "I 
think I can. I (hink I can," 

When the Tuskers opened 
their conference season with 
a few more wins, they 
started to get more con- 
fident. "I think- 1 can. I think 
1 can." It was early in the 
conference season and some 
of their toughest matches 
were yet to come, bul they 
were winning. 

Having beat Cincinnati at 
home after losing three 
times to the Bearcats early 
in the season, the volleyball 
team knew it belonged at 
that level of play. All of a 
sudden, IPFW was in 
position to win the division 
title. "I know I can. I know I 



To force a showdoivn with 
George Williams and a 
chance for a piece of Ihe 
title, the Tuskers had to win 
the rest of their conference 
matches. And they did. Now 
only the match with George 
Williams on the last day of 
the season stood between the 
Tuskers and the top of the 
hill. "I know I can. I know I 

Then the little train ran out 
of gas. 

The Tuskers lost to the 
Chicago school Saturday, 15- 
8, 16-14, 15-6. "In the second 
sel, wewereaheadl4-12wilh 
the serve, and just didn't get 
the job done," coach Arnie 
Ball said. The little train 
thought il could . . . and 
almost did. 

IPFW also faced 
Wisconsin Saturday, losing 
15-10, 15-8, 15-6. "After we 
gul beal by George Williams, 
it just didn't seem the 
Wisconsin match meant a 
tot." Ballsaid. 

Last Wednesday, the 
Tuskers spiked Fort Wayne 
Bible College, 15-2, 15-7, 15-8. 
"We had a good time," the 
coach said. "I played 
everybody." 

For (he season, IPFW 
wound up 14-20 overall and 5- 
3 in the conference. It 
marked an improvement 
over last year's 9-21 mark 
with only two conference 



Juniors Paul Wyss and 
Colin Leiter, both of Harding 
High School, were named co- 
MVPs at last night's 
banquel. Chris Cole, a fresh- 
man from New Haven, 
received the award for most 
improved player. 

Wyss led the Tuskers in 
spikes with 346 kills. His kill 
rate (kills minus errors 
divided by attempts) was 30 
percent. Freshman Pat 
Menzie had a kill rate of 17.8 
percent for 179 points. 

Leiter topped the servers 
with 87 aces in 531 serves. 
Freshman Joe Hammons 
served 40 aces in 341 serves. 

Ball rales his squad's 
passes on a scale of zero 
imisplayed ball) lo four 
(perfect pass). Menzie ac- 
cumulated 769 points for Ihe 
season in 333 attempts for a 
2.3 average. Matt Heller, a 
sophomore from Leo, had 244 
points in 87 attempts for a 
2.86average. 

The future appears bright 
for the Tuskers since there 
are no seniors on the learn. 
Most of Ihe players have 
indicated they will play next 
year, Ball said. On the 
recruiting front, two players 
from Harding have given 
Ball a verbal commitment. A 
number of other prospects 
are considering IPFW. Ball 



Team members may 
be best in state

He may be tiny for his 
species 'only eight inches 
(all), but "Tuskers" is one 
stuffed elephant who wields 
some power. 

"Tuskers" is the mascot of 
the women's track (earn 
who, according lo coach 
Peggy Voison, "brings the 
team together." The."cule" 
little elephant travels lo all 
Ihe meets and seems lo have 
laken a pari in helping the 
women as they progress 
through a good season. 

Although Ihe women are 
not laking first place in all 
their meets, ihey are con- 
sistently selling records and 
breaking them in their next 
meets. 

Last week in Manchester, 
the learn sel five new 
records, and four days later, 
at the Marion Invitational, 
Ihey set three more In 
Manchester Ihe learn placed 
third in Ihe three-loam 
lineup, and in Marion the 
learn placed third in a six- 
team lineup 

Most of the team has 
already qualified for the 
Lillle Stale competition at 
Taylor on May 9. where 
members of 20 schools will 
be running for top honors 

Linda Przeniczny, the 
team's main sprinter, 
regislcred her first defeats 
in Ihe 100 and 2iMi meter 
dashes at the Marion 
Invitational; iiui sin.' allows 



good potential for the state 
meet. "She is very talented, 
and in my mind she's 
number one in the state," 
said Voison. 

Chances are also good thai 
Jill Thiele will earn the title 
of best in the sta(e in the 1500 
meter run. She has yet to be 
beaten. "She won't give up," 
said Voison. 

Unless someone qualifies 
for the AIAW Nationals, the 
team will end its season with 
the state meet at Taylor. 
Then il may begin preparing 
for next season. 

Next year looks really 
good and there should be a 
good nucleus returning from 
which lo build, said Voison. 
And "Tuskers" will be there 




now servicing 
foreign and 
domestic cars 
also light trucks!
