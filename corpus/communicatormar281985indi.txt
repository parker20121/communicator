Conlcmporary American slang lives! 
Really t[ doa Just not here. 

Who among lu dreary commuter 
sludenU knows "Swooping on a FJy"

inKCcI dcslroyer, but rather the donning 
of a "Totally llol" ouiTil and a splash of 
"Killer" cologne''

In many parLi of the (.-oufilry, and on 
many high-school and college campuses. 
And swooping (which can t&gt;c practiced 
by and on either seitj is making a move 
on your male of choice. See how easy it 
If? 

Spring break is nearly upon us. Now 
listen up all you happy campers, and you 
shall leorn Ihc ropes of the live vocab 
that's hoppcnln' in Spring Break. USA 

And please, try to lake this seriously. 
or you might be unexpectedly "Faced"

cholce next week. 

OK, gel "Jacked"' igeared up,

It'sPrlday afternoon and you and your 
"Gopher" (an eager and frequent 
swoopce&gt; ore ready to "Rage" (havea 
good time) along with .some other 
"Happy Campers" (people In a good

rude and "Bogus" thing to do, but your

And who knows? By the lime you're 
ready to "Trckkit" home you might be

Fort cleans up it's act 



Letters to the Editor 



ByJULIEA.RORlCK 
Staff Writer 

Although patrons may disagree on the 
quality and taste of The Fort's food, Ihey 
seem to agree the cleanliness of the 
cafeteria has improved in the past 
couple of weeks. Yes, Servomalion, 
IPFW's mechanical nutrition supplier, 
now comes complete with its own 
"picker upper" who takes care of The 
Fort's sanitary needs, 

Prcsenled with concerned remarks 
IroSii coreKria patrons, "higher ups" 
strongly urged the need lo employ an 
Individual to lidy up the dining area. So 
now. an individual spends eight hour 
days cleoring puddles, crumbs, wadded 
napkins, cigarette bulls and anything 



else patrons leave behind to duller the 
dining area, while newly-covered trash 
cans stand only a few feel away. 

Other cafeteria workersare kepi more 
than busy with their jobs and previously 
have had little lime to clear the dining 
area. Bui with one problem out bf ihe 
way. other employees have managed lo 
miraculously diminish the pile of dishes 
wailing to be scraped and washed. 
Perhaps cafeteria workers now have 
more lime lo spend on their other tasks, 
such as food preparation? 

The Fort should be applauded for its 
sincere effort towards cleanliness and 
sanitation With one problem solved, few
