Student elections 



Smith wins presidency 



By DAVID N. BENSON 
News Editor 

Tim Smith has emerged the winner 
in the election tor student body 
president, which was held last 
Tuesday and Wednesday. Smith 
defeated rivals Eric Record and Mike 
Ganaway. 

Kris Maly, Smith's running mate. 
has won the race for vice president, 
defeating Carol Hildebrand. Tina 
Long, who was also on the ticket with 
Smith, has been elected chair of the 
Student Activities Board, Long ran 
unopposed. 

The election results were certified 
on Friday by Judie Bowers, 
parliamentarian to Students' 
Government, 

In an interview Monday, Smith said 
he would like to see Students' 
Government become more profession- 
al. The sophomore political science 
major said he is working with Marian 
Adair, acting Dean of Students, to 
inform senators on parliamentary 
procedure, 

■'Sometime in the summer, we will 
have a weekend retreat. We will go 
over proper procedure and how to 
introduce a bill and get it passed," 
Smith said. 

Smith said he would move to recruit 
students for Students' Government. 
"Next year we are going to send out a 
letter telling students who we are and 
what we can do for students, I would 
like to see a full senate next year." 



Businesses 
provide funds 
for engineer 



The department of engineering has 
created a new faculty position. ITT 
Aerospace/Optical and Magnavox 
have provided funds to hire a radio- 
frequency engineer for a high-level 
position. 

This professor will have a lighter 
teaching load for undergraduate 
courses but must also be available to 
ITT and Magnavox for consulting. 

"He or she will be available to these 
companies to help with research 
projects and commercial ventures." 
said Ron Emery, acting chair of the 
engineering department, "He or she 
could also be responsible for teaching 
technical courses for engineers from 
the participating companies." 

The faculty position opening will t&gt;e 
advertised in the April issue of the 
IEEE Spectrum magazine. Chancellor 
Thomas Wallace indicated that filling 
this position will enable IPFW to pro- 
vide more technical support (or the 
community. 



Smith said. 

Smith also talked about what he 
would like to see happen at the state 
level. Last year, the president-elect 
was a member of the Stale Legislative 
Coordinating Committee, which has 
been renamed the Indiana Student 
Association. The association lobbies 



for legislation it feels is in the best 
interest of students. 

Smith said the association is work- 
ing toward making the process of 
transferring credits within the lU 
system easier. He wants to see tuition 
costs limited to no more than one- third 
of a university's operating costs. 



By CAROL CARNALL 

Staff Writer 

Increasing numbers of adults are 

returning to school, and their presence 

on college campuses is having a wide 
range of effects on higher education. 
This was the subject of a presentation 
by individuals from various campuses 
of Indiana University (or the Board of 
Trustees meeting on April 9 at Walb 
Memorial Union, 

The speakers said adulls return to 
college for a variety of reasons. 

As the numbers of older people in- 
crease, a growing percentage o( senior 
citizens look for enrichment and 
renewal through educational 
programs. 

Economic and social changes are 
bringing more women to the campuses 
to seek new careers or to return to 
their academic work after interruption 
by family obligations. 

As businesses, professions and ser- 
vice industries increasingly mandate 
continuous learning or competency 
certification, adult men and women 
are turning to the universities for pro- 
fessional development and licensing 
requirements. 

In response to the explosion of in- 
formation and technical innovation, 
many adults need retraining for job 
changes. It is estimated that current 
college graduates entering the work 
force can expect to change jobs every 
three years. 

The presence of these adult learners 
in the university system has given 
birth to the concept of "lifelong learn- 
ing". Panel presentations at the 
meeting reported the efforts of 
Indiana University to meet the needs 
of these older, typically part-time 
students enrolled in credit programs. 

New procedures for registration, 
allowing students to register by mail 
and telephone, are being explored on 
some of the Indiana University 
campuses. Evening and weekend 
classes make programs more 
accessible to adults with personal and 
work obligations, Telecourses and off- 
campus course sites, such as business 
establishments, shopping centers, high 
schools, government and retirement 
facilities, respond to problems of 
geography and time. Over 200 credit 



courses that meet degree require- 
ments are offered by correspondence, 
as well as an extensive high school 
completion program. 

Services such as day care and "how 
to succeed in college" programs (or 
the returning adult student have 
l)ecome important considerations. 

Special support groups for returning 
women have been organized on most 
campuses. A recent survey shows that 
of Indiana University students over 25 
years old. 64 percent are women and 
77 percent attend part time. 

Continuing education programs 
provide an array of non-credit classes, 
including professional development, 
labor studies and personal enrichment 
programs in literature, music,' drama 
and the fine arts. 

The demand for lifelong learning 
programs is expected to intensify. 
Meeting that demand, however, will 
mean making significant new 
commitments by universities. Despite 
their increasing numbers, lifelong 
learners are still considered as a non- 
traditional presence on campuses, the 
speakers said. 

Although some campuses have 
special scholarships for adults and 
women, and financial assistance is 
theoretically available to all who meet 
the published guidehnes, financial aid 
is quite limited to students with part- 
time status. This and other issues, 
such as the statute of limitations on 
undergraduate credit, need to be 
re-examined, they stressed. 

Older students have become a 
stimulus for the new vision of the 
imiversity as a marketplace of ideas, 
A study of their needs could have a 
profound implication on curriculum 
planning, program design and future 
resource allocation, which has become 
a critical issue, they contend. 

Proposed lief ore the Board of 
Trustees was the establishment of a 
Center for the Study of Lifelong 
Learning. Through such a center, 
Indiana University could serve as a 
national resource by sponsoring re- 
search on lifelong learning, promoting 
the exchange of ideas and designing a 
more comprehensive program of 
support services to match an adult's 
academic experience, they concluded. 



Increase of adult jstudents 
affecting higher education 



Trustees 
discuss 



issues 



By JOHN AUGUSTVNIAK 

Copy Editor 

The Indiana University Board of 

Trustees discussed campus concerns 

at the IPFW Faculty Relations 

Committee meeting on Saturday. 

Steve Hollander, speaker for the lU 
faculty, was asked to address the 
board. "I see lU moving from a 
colonial system to a commonwealth, I 
welcome that change," he said. 

Hollander stated the faculty were 
upset by a memorandum issued by 

Indiana University President Tom 
Ehrlich. Ehrlich's two-paragraph 
memorandum, not intended for 
circulation, stated thai all candidates 
for promotion and tenure should have 
six letters of recommendation, four of 
which should come from non-collegial 
affiliation. This is an abrogation of 
faculty prerogative. which is 
guaranteed by the faculty constitution, 
Bald Hollander. 

Bob Gates, chairman of the board, 
asked, "Why is it that lU-Indianapolis 
has very few problems?" 

"One (reason) is the nature of the 
press," Hollander replied, questioning 
whether lUI is really as problem-free 
as the public or press may believe. 

Citing administrative instability as 
another cause of local problems, 
Hollander said he has worked under 
nine chancellors in this 19 years at 
IPFW. Because of leadership from 
people who did not have the authority 
to lead and self-styled administrators, 
it will take some time (or faculty to 
believe administrators should t&gt;e 
listened to, said Hollander. 

Gates admitted. "You do have a 

unique situation." 

Trustee James Dye criticized the 
process of search-and-screen for 

chancellors as expensive, tedious and 
ineffective. It's against one's nature to 
subject one's self to such a procedure, 
Dye said, and the best candidates are 
lost. 

Problems with the merger school of 
Arts and Sciences, which contains 
both lU and Purdue employees, were 
addressed, but no resolutions were 
reached. 



C ommunicator

TTiucidsv. April 14. 1988 



Election results 



Students Rights Party 
governs student senate 



Tim Smith's election victory 
gives IPFW students a talented, 
student body president. Even so. 
Students' Government will face 
problems in the coming school 
year. 

Smith must never forget that he 
is the president of all IPFW stu- 
dents, not just those who voted for 
him. Last fall Students' Govern- 
ment gave some of its office space 
to the Black Collegian Caucus. 
There are no black senators, so the 
move puts Students' Government in 
contact with an important group it 
seldom saw. 




There are many other such 
groups. At the moment, the senate 
is almost exclusively ID students, 
many of whom are in the School of 
Arts'and Sciences. The previous 17- 
member senate had only one engi- 
neering major. In contrast, it had 
seven political science majors. Any 
decision the senate makes will be 
without the advice of large seg- 
ments of the student body. There- 
fore, recruitment will mean not 
only more bodies to fill empty 



chairs but people from depart- 
ments underrepresented. 

Smith will not be alone. The vice 
president, Kris Maly, is a member 
of the International Students Or- 
ganization. The Student Activities 
Board Charr, Tina Long, works in 
the Women's Center. Smith should 
listen carefully to the views of 
Maly and Long. 

Currently, Students' Government 
is between shifts. Most of this 
vear's veterans have left. The in- 
flux of new talent in Students' 
Government has not yet arrived. A 
good policy would be to ensure that 
new talent comes from those un- 
derrepresented segments from the 
student body. 

Smith will also have to rebuild 
the strained relations between 
Students' Government and the 
administration. Of course, no one is 
asking for a love affair between 
Students' Government and the 
administration, but irresponsible 
battles between the two benefit no 
one. 

Finally. Smith should endorse the 
writing of a new constitution that 
reflects the needs of Students' 
Government today, not five years 
ago. 

As the year comes to a close, a 
students' government more repre- 
sentative of students and more 
willing to work with the adminis- 
tration and a new constitution 
should top Smith's agenda.

Writings critiqued 

To the Edllor: 

You might want to review 
your commitment to your 
mission as a newspaper in 
the students' interest— all 
the students. Two articles in 
the April 7, 1988 issue of 
The Communicator caused 
me to wonder if anyone is 
awake over there at Walb. 

After first questioning the 
pi-opriety of the appearance, 
of John Augustyniak's 



sermon (which was lat)eleii 
a commentary) in The 
Communicator, I suggest 
Uiat he take Gaii Williams' 
course in religion, which is 
offered through the philos- 
ophy department. After 
taking some time and mak- 
ing some effort to educate 
himself, he might learn that 
Christianity is, indeed, a 
religious denomination- 
only one of those to which 
students on this campus 
might l)elong. 
Might I also suggest to 



Kim Scrogham that she do 
some comparison shopping 
and check for the possibility 
of self-interest in her 
sources before submitting 
an ad disguised as an ar- 
ticle? It would seem only 
fair that any further ads for 
Follett's be identified as 
such and paid for, as is re- 
quired of other, less ex- 
ploitive, business entities. 

Kathleen Richards 
Student,

the 'Dons on Sunday, April

On Ihe strength of a run- 
ner-up finish on their Naval 
Academy Spiketacula 
Tournamenl, the IPFW 
\'olleydons prepare for 
what could lie a very 
pivotal Midwest Inter- 
collegiate Volleyball Asso- 
ciation match with Ball 
Slate The Dons host the 
event this Saturday, April 
16, al Ihe Athletic Center, 

At the lime of this writ- 
ing. Ball Slate is leading the 
MIVA with a perfect 3-0 
record, IPFW is in second 
with a mark of 3-2, By the 
time the Cardinals come (o 
Fort Wayne this weekend, 
they will have played MIVA 
member Ohio Slate this 
past Tuesday. If the 
Buckeyes defeat Ball State, 
the Vol ley dons will only be 
a half game out of first 
place in the MIVA, and with 
a win Saturday, they could 
tie with the Cards and the 
Buckeyes for the conference 
title with identical 4-2 
records, 

A point system will tie 
used to break the tie and 
determine which of the 
three learns will get the bye 
in the MIVA tournament. 
The MIVA tourney winner 
will get an automatic bid to 
the NCAA Tournament. 
Even if IPFW doesn't tie 
for the conference lead, it 
could still get an NCAA bid 
by winning the MIVA 
tourney, 

"I feel good about the 
upcoming Ball State match; 
we'll play well, and the kids 
are really looking forward 
to playing at home," said 
Coach Arnie Ball,

Bodine again led in 
assists, this time with 47.

Bodine, 39 assists. The win 
over Navy put the 'Dons in

against Ohio State. 

"It would have been nice 



lo have won (the tourna- 
menl), bul we did play 
l)elter offensively than we 
have in a white," said Ball. 

"We still have to work on 
some Ijltte things-our 
transition game-and we still 
have lo serve with more 
confidence," the coach 
added. 

Volleydons named lo the 
all-tourney team were 



Golsteyn and Malcolm.
