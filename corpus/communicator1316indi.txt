advisors lo help students with un- 
declared majors. The advisors' duties 
include coordinating scheduling, ad- 
ding and dropping courses, advising

helping select a major best suited lo Ihe

Donna Worlhley founded the Student

nearly 4D0 students each semester. 

According to Worlhley. the program

The senate, in its own way, is trying lo

Bui the objective of ihe PIT program is 
lo teach all phases of theater, skills such 
as management, set and costume

techniques. These crews are composed 
almost entirely of students. They should
