POLITICAL FORUM 
HOSTS SILVERMAN 



Last Wednesday, the 
ReRionel Campus was host 
to Mr. Manuel Silvcrmau, 
Democratic candidate for 
Slate le^isUturE. Mr. Sil- 
verman spoke to approxi- 
mately twenty concerned 
students about the pro- 
blems of our state. In re- 
sponse to student's ques- 
tions, Mr. Silverman pointed 
out the advantaj;..; oi (lie 
Democratic platform. He 
atated that Indiana's lax 
rate js one of tbe lowest 
with matching state services. 

L.wtriog or mxe. is . fiaral 
impoBBiblily but the re- 
is a necessity. Tbe Demo- 

2% sales tax, take from the 
property tax the burden of 
sehooU which is about 60% 
of the property lax dollar. 
All education would be 
funded by tbe state. A 3 to 
f7% graduated lax would be 
instituted along with a raise 
of the corporate tax from 2 
to 4S. Mr. Silverman also 
pointed out that as it stands 
an older person on social 
security, a young couple just 
starting out, and the inner- 
city poor are disproportion- 
ately hard hit because they 
have to pay a larger propor- 
tion of ihcir income in sales 



and personal property tax for 
the same purchase as does 
someone who can easily af- 
ford it. Tbe Republican plan 
only offers more of the same; 
in fact, thev wish to increase 
the sales tax. 

Also, Mr. Silverman urged 
each citizen to vote [or the 
referendum on this year's 
ballot allowing the legis- 
lature to meet every year. 
This would cut the time 

tional amendment from more 
than 4 years down to 2 years. 



Trash Is Cash 



One of the major sour- 
ces of pollution today is 
tbe nonrclurnable container. 
The President's Environ- 
mental Quality Council re- 
ports that, unless something 
is done rapidly to prevent it, 
there will be as many as 100 
billion virtually indestruc- 
table bottles and cans by 
19a0. Luckily, already sev- 
eral states have realized 
this growing problem and 
hove begun some form of 
legislative action to tax and 
even ban tbe nonrctumables.

BANDANA TOUR 



tjandana, a rock group 
from Los Angeles whose 
music resembles that of the 
early Jefferson Airplane, 
took time to visit our cam- 
pus Inst Friday. Three 
members of the group were 
bcrc and although their 
feelings about our lovely 
city were far from warm, 
they did admit Ft. Wayni^ 
like most other places, did 
hove some really good peo- 
pie.

Student Body President 
Scott Gillie is in the pro- 
cess of drawing up plans 
tor a Presidential News 
Conference. The plan has 
not been fully articulated

means through which the

Gillie stated tbnt he 
hopes to include the Chair- 
man of the Studeut Union 
Board. Mike Herron, in the 
program in order that stu- 
dents may confer with repre- 
sentatives of all segments 
of elected student leadership. 
Gillie further slated, "This 
is one opportunity for any- 
one with an opinion about 
student government to air 
that opinion." 

The date for the event 
has not been set but is 
expected to he sometime in 
the latter part of October.

It was decided quickly 
that o sidewalk to the free

will be planned and completed 
as soon as possible. Other 
discussion included the cost 
of the sidewalk and where

ALL CAVIPUS TRAFFIC APPEALS BOARD 



CONFLICT EXPLAINED 



RE: All Campus Traffic Appeals Board 

Dear Dean Nelson and Chancellor Broyles 

As meinbers of the Student Body, we recently read with 
much interest the pamphlet entitled Motor Vehicle, Bicycle, &amp; 
Traffic Regulations. Mentioned in the pamphlet is the forma- 
tion oF an All Campus Traffic Appeals Board, which will, in 
essence, supersede the present Student Body Traffic Appeals 
Court and Student Supreme Court. Accordingly, we checked 
the legality of such a board with the present authority struc- 
ture, i.e.. Student Body Constitution, past procedures rcgard- 
ing constitutional change, and found that the formation of the 
Traffic Appeals Board was completely outside the jurisdiction 
of the school administration. 

It is our belief that the Student Board Constitution serves 
as a compact between students and school administration. It 
is this compact which serves as the only viable inlet for stu- 
dent participation in the formation of school policy. It is, in 
other words, the only existing facility for student input within 
the present authority structure of Indiana and Purdue Univer- 
sities of Fort Wayne. Communication to Assistant Dean Man- 
ges regarding this breach ot contract was made and later con- 
siderations by your offices were sent to Student Body Presi- 
dent Scott Gillie. Your reply and denial to altering the Traf- 
fic Appeals Board is a complete denial of any concept of stu- 
dent input within the present system, ft would seem that you 
have deliberately launched a policy of excluding students 
from controlling, or even participating in those decisions 
that will affect them. 

Students' Government and the Student Body have made 
every attempt to work within the present power structure. All 
procedures have failed. In effect, the present administrations 
have lost or are losing their legitimacy with the students.- 
Loss of legitimacy within the system often results in internal 
conflict, often manifesting itself in different forms of civil 
and social upheaval. Perhaps more important though, loss of 
legitimacy causes individuals to act outside the existing 
structure, whether manifested in counter-culture, or more em- 
phatically, civil disobedience. 

Proper channels have not been followed bf your depart- 
ments. Resultant from your abrasive actions is the loss of 
student participation. Loss of student participation results in 
loss of belief and trust in the present system. A prime exam- 
ple of one of the many possible manifestations of this loss is 
the University of Columbia incidents In the spring of 1968. 
We, as students, have been thrust out of the structure by the 
administrations' arbitrary action. The means used to ostra- 
cize us were also outside the present structure. Are we. In 
turn, expected to begin acting from without in order to change 
the system? 

There has been more than a lack of good faith on your 
part, You have broken a compact that was made by your pre- 
decessors and ours. A compact that we have attempted to ful- 
fill, but one to which you do not seem to feel obligated. We 
have no choice but to interpret your action as arbitrary, ar- 
rogant, and in the final analysis illegal . 

We studentsare told to work through the established chan- 
nels, but you take actions which show your disdain For your 
ownchanncls',when you find them inconvenient. If the admin- 
istration refuses to follow the 'established channels, to up- 
hold ihe tompact. then that compact has been shattered. One 
party, the administration, cannot be above the iaw.

BY STEVE FRANKS 



Wednesday night, Octo- 
ber 14, 1970 the Student Sen- 
ate met to discuss the crisis 
of the Campus Traffic Appeah 
Board. Present besides tht 
Senate were two Boord of 
Trustees members, Dean R. 
Manges, and ( coming in late) 
Dean L.O. Nelson. 

Mr. Gillie brought out ihc 
problem by sayinft that the 
Board is ilcgal, because it 
was started without the con- 
sent of Student Government. 
He admitted talking with Nel- 
son last July, but he pre- 
sumed they (Kent Stier, Dean 
Nelson, Dean Manges, and 
Mr. Gillie ) had only reached 
a philosophical agreement. 
He heard nolhinR more on the 
idea until he read the yellow 
booklet. 

Dean Manges stated that 
there had been a misunder- 
standing in July. He felt a 
formol decision had been 
made , and he moved in full 
faith. Manges suggested em- 
ploying a new Joint Parking 
Advisory Committee to study 
the problem and make a rec- 
comendatio as to its solu- 

Mike Nusbaumer asked if 
Dean Manges did not know 
the Board had been started in 
direct violation of the Stu- 
dent Government Constitu- 
tion, Manges replied, "[ 
quite frankly did not realize 

lation of the constitution. 
And [ don't think Kent and 
Scott did cither." Mr, Gillie 
then stated, "The proposal 
which we were offered at 
that time, thot we did say we 
were philosophically in a- 
greement, is not the proposal 
that came out in the final 
form anyway," 



The 



then 



turned to ways of solving the 

problem. It was sugftested 

that the Board of Trustees 

rescind the Traffic Board 



Nels. 



Ihcr 



lered and slated hostilly that 
he was ready to discuss the 
problem. He was tired of com- 
municaling by letters only. 

Then, opinions came out 
saying that the student gov- 
ernment had only been rep- 
resented by two people. They 
wanted to see a written draft 
of Ihe Traffic Board, in order 
lo implement it themselves. 

It was then brought up 
that one should go back to 
Ihe beginning of everything 
and start over on a New 
Traffic Board. The solution 
came in a suggestion by Tom 
Newman to suspend the Cam- 
pus Traffic Appeals Board for 
ninety days ond let a Joint 
Parking Advisory Committee 
work on it. Dean Nelson said 
he would talk favorably with 
whoever has ihe authority to 
suspend arlicle 9.01 of the 
yellow booklet. 

Newman then put his sug- 
gestion in form of a motion: 
"[ move to ask Dean Nelson 
to attempt to secure a ninety 
day suspension on Article 
9.01 on Traffic Appeals 
Board to allow time for a 

Traffic Advisory Committee 

to find a workable solution 

lo traffic appeals." This mo- 

in was seconded, discussed 

1(1 finally voted on. It was 

irricd unanimously. 

This leaves the Appeals 
Board situatioa in a ninety 
day holding period. Much of 



but a fine

Edit, 



With beer in hand. I sit 
down to write you this letter. 
I have realized that the park- 
ing system here on campus is 
not the best in the world. 
Thursday, I had to make-up a 
test, so I parked my usual 
three miles away in the B lot 
and ran to the building so 
that I would not be lole and 
miss my test. I completed my 
test and again, walked all the 
way out to my car. When { fi- 
nally reached it. there was a 
parking ticket on the wind- 
shield. Since I'm not used to 
getting parking tickets, I hur- 
ried and read this one. ll 
seems thai I had placed my 
fruity sticker in the wrong 
place— it is next -to my C 



federate flag in the rear of mr 
car. So. I was fined t2.00 foi 
this formality. I decided ic 
go up to the Safety and Secur- 
ity Office and check this thing 
out. The lady was very nice 
about ike whole thing and 
gave me two forms lo fill out 
in order fgr me to gel a new 
slicker. I was really in a bad 
mood over the whale thing and 
really let her know how I felt. 
I said that next year, I was 
going to park across the river 
in the free lot and that the 
University {College or what- 
ever) could lake their parking 
system and shove it up iheir 
ass. A bit gross., but straight 
to ihc point. I still feel thai 
they can shove it iip their 
ass and if I had enough money, 
I would park my Gran Prix any- 
where I wanted. Maybe, right

Gillie 



Dear Editor: 

In the Slate of Campus 
delivered by Seott 
he athletic program 
was needlessly assaulted 
and criticised for ezpendi- 
lures. To mild-mannered 
Scotl Gillie. Ihe idea of hav- 
ing collegiate sports seems 
useless. Why should all 
pay for a few? In biv op- 
inion this question is what 
Mr. -Mild-mannered GHUe' 
is trying to say. 

However, the sports 
program should be delved 
into and a few more ideas 
should be produced. I.U.- 
P.V. Campus is young in 
its sports tradition; thus it 
lacks the lustre of schools 
such as Notre Dame, 
U.C.L.A. orV-S.C. These 
schools thai arc rich in 
sports tradition arc also 
rich financially due to 
the dollar produced by 
sports activity. This re- 



gional campus may not have 
the potential to reach a 
peak such as N.D.. V.C.L..i. 
or V.S.C., but it does have 
a surrounding area thai 
could produce intake instead 
of output. Since this school 
is just starling to grow, it 
needs output to draw the es- 
sential ingredients to build 
a solid program. 

For years this school 
has been hardly more than a 
figment of

M. STANTON EVANS' "HARD-HATS" 



by Mark Souder 

The following article first appeared in the tiatiaoii 
RfviBw Bjilptin on June 9, 1970 in H. Stanton Evans' 
regular column entitled "At Home." M. Stanton Evans, in 
addition to being a senior editor of National Review and of 
Human Fvp|^^y is editor of the Indjanpolis News . He has 
authored man)* books including The Future of Conservation . 
The LihBral Fittahiishment. TH^ Politics o f Surrender. The 
Lawbreakers , and Revolt on Campus . His articles appear 
in journals of opinion across the country andhe's ahighly 
sought after lecturer. Among his accomplishments is the 
authorship of the "Sharon Statement," the philosophical 
foundation of Young Americans for Freedom. He has kindly 
given me permission to reprint It. 

It is diatressing to note that Mayor John Lindsay and 
certain other political spokemen were so quick to denounce 
the construction workers who jumped a group of Vietnik de- 
monstrators in the New York financial district. 

This seems, to say ihe least, out of character. Shortly 
before this episode, Lindsay had praised New Left types 
who defy laws which ihey disagree with, and indeed has 
made a career for himself by apologizing for and declaring 
his solidarity with leftists who take the law into their own 
hands. In this he has had the vociferous backing of count- 
less other liberals in government, the academy and the com- 
municalions media." 

To be consistent with their previous stand, Lindsay 
and bis liberal friends should form themselves into a Com- 
mission to Study Iho Causes of the Construction Workers' 
Alienation, and find out just what inadequacies in our so- 
ciety have driven the workers to feel ihe need for Mtra- 
legal action. It is easy to pontificate about "law and ori 
der," but we have become well aware of late that these are 
merely code words for repression. What is demanded is not 
tbe slinging about of empty phrases, but some effort to un- 
derstand the causes of such bcbavior. 

The first and most obvious conclusion of this inquir)- 
would undoubtedly be that the existing state of (he law is 
unjust and should be changed. While this column in no 
sense condones violence, it is apparent the construction 
workers feel ihe laws governing this sort of conduct are 
no longer relevant and that the very existence of slalulcs 
punishing assault ond battery and other forms of dissent is 

over outmoded notions of legality. Repealing these statutes

cumslonccs and that this contributes to iheir feeling that 
"The System" is unresponsive. Small wonder tbey are 
frustrated and angry when they are getting so little atten- 
tion from federal authorities. U may be alleged that the 
workers ore already enjoying high rates of pay, but this ig- 
nores the fact that no rale of pay is to treat ibcm fairly. 
A gigantic program of federal subsidies to help ihem over- 
come ibc conditions that breed violence would seem 'o be 



indicated. 

There is another factor in the liberal analys 
should be applied. We must realize that construe 
kcrs are earnestly trying to "relate," in an open 
est fashion, to the publit 

'boys" so to speak 
illy our idealistic 
1 the politico] pro- 
way which to them 
iningful. That tbc) are breaking 
past artificial conventions and simply "doing their thing" 
completely and unashamedly is a cause for hope, not sor- 



iing the construction workers' performance, 
&lt;n might also note that this is perhaps the 
finest generation of construction workers our nation has 
ever seen. Although it ia true that "ibe boys" have not 
delved into the classics and in many coses are not great 
readers, we must remember this is the first group of con- 
struction workers we have had which has grown up entirely 
under the influence of television. They are in many ways 
far better informed on truly important matters than the con- 
struction workers of the past. We need only took at the 
impressive buildings they have been putting up to realize 
this. 

Finally, it should be observed that it is totally unfair 
to. judge all construction ivorkers by the actions of a few. 
A worker interviewed by columnist Don Maclean points out 
that the vast majority of the hard-hala in New York did not 
want violence, and ihal the Wall Street "confrontation" 
occurred only because the workers were unwisely provoked, 
[t is reasonable to suppose most of "the boys" will not en- 
gage in violence if their demands are met without hesita- 
tion. Should their desires be thwarted, however, responsi- 
bility for the ensuing holocaust will rest with those who 
resist the imperatives of necessary change. 

There are no easy answers to the questions the con- 
struction workers have raised, but the least we can do is to 
listen to wbot they are trying to tell us and work with them 
toward a common solution- While "law-and-order" fanatics 
like Mayor Lindsay may find that attacking "the bays"is 
an easy way to gel voles, men of good will must try to ham- 
,ncr out some kind of response to the issues the workers 
have so forcefully projected. Continued abuse by politicians 
of the Lindsay stripe can only serve further lo polarize os. 
As a result, some of the finest minds among the present 
generation of construction workers may be lost to us for- 



All in all, tbe liberal answci 
theater should be clear: Such n

~. that 



"the boys" crying oul in protest. In a 
real sense, we have failed the construction workers. The 
only possible recourse is to have them lour the campuses 
for a handsome fee and explain their philosophy of life. 
Perhaps then we can learn from ihem the lesson they are 
so desperately trying to teach.

ENROLLMENT 



Exactly 150 studtnls 
arc . as of Monday. Ocl- 
nber 5 . now enrolled in 
:ourecs sponsored by the Fort 
Wuync Free Universily. Of 
the 15 classes originally of- 
fered, livo have been defin- 
itely caneelled due to n lack 
of evidenced interest. 

For those students who

Gillie advises that they

the opportunities 
cation open to students and 
the general public free of 
charge, but also the course 
offerings and methods of 
teaching represent a more 
liberal attitude towards 
learning than that to which 
most students are probably 



concerned with the growth of 
dependence upon governm£nt 
and the threat of communism. 
lie complimented Roudebush 
for articulating conservative 
positions even ivhen the risk 
exceeds the benefit, such as 
Roudebush's criticism of 
r/ixon's visit to Yugoslavia. 
Stuckey pointed out that, 
despite Hartke's recent com- 
ments concerning cancer 
("If I am re-elected, we will 
have a cure for cancer by 
1976"), neither he nor the 
other Roudebush leaders s'up- 
port cancer either.

Trash.. cont. from pg. I 
The Environmental Action 
Coalition launched, in mid- 
September, a "Trash is 
Cash" reclamation project 

panics who have agreed to 
pay for collected bottles, 
aluminum, bimetal, and steel 
cans. Many youth, church and 
conservation groups through- 
out the country have also 
taken part in cleanup drives 
to help beautify their area aod 
make money 

Among the legislative 
proposals now under consid- 

sponsored by Sen. Gaytord 
Nelson, D-Wis., which would 
impose a "disposal charge" 
on cootainer manufacturers. 
Hisbill would return the dis- 
posal charge to state and 
municipal governments. 

Private industry and 

other areas which deal with 

disposable containers. Tests 
are underway to develop self- 
destruct bottles. plastic 
bottles that can be burned 
without polluting the air, and 
warp to crush and reuse old 
glass. But these containers 
are still several years from 
perfection and by then who 
knows what (he situation 
will be. 



LOVE 

I may be able to speak 
the languages of men ond 
even of angels, but if I hove 
not love, my speech is no 

clanging bell, l' may have 
the gift of inspired preach- 
ing; I may hove all Knowl- 
edge and understand all 
secrets; I may have all the 
faith aeeded to move moun- 
tains-but if I have not love, 
I am nothing. I may give 
away everything I have, and 
even give up my body to be 
burned-bulirihaveaollove, 
it doca me no good. 

Love is patient and kin4 

ceitcd, or proud; love is not 
ill-mannered, or selfish, or 
irritable; love does not keep 

not happy with evil, but is 
happy with the truth. Love 
never gives up: its faith, 

fail. ' 

Love is eternal. There 
are inspired messages, but 
they arc temporary; there is 
knowledge, but it will pass. 
For our gifts of knowledge 
and of inspired messages 
arc only partial; but

When I was a child, my

all those of a 
child; now that I am a man, 
I have no more use {or child- 
ish ways. What we see oow 
is like the dim image in a 
mirror; then we shall see 
face -to face. What I know now 
is only partial; then it will 
be complete, as complete as 
Cod's knowledge of me. 

Meanwhile these three 
remain: faith, hope, and 
love; and the greatest of these 
is love. I Cor. 13
