"We're not saying we're too percent

we're in a comparable situation." he 
said. "We're not where we want to be

Senate wants 
more courts 
made available 

By JOHNETTE TOPUSEK 
Staff Writer 

Availabilliy of basketball courts for IPFW students was the concern of the 
sludenl senate Nov. 9. 

The senate passed a resolution, with a vote of 6-3 and one abstalnment, 
requesting the othldlc center administration and coaches to allow students access 
lo courts not being used lor team practices. 

The problem is all three courts are closed to students when the men's and 
women's basketball "earns are practicing; 

Many times when thcteams are practicing, however, oneor two of the courts axe 
being used. With the other courts available and with curtains that could be used to 
separate the courts. Ihc senate feels students should be allowed lo use the available 

Earl Daugheny, student senator, said, "The facility Ilhe Multi-purpose 
Building) is for all students . " 

"I am for the men's and women's basketball teams," said Ken McBride, student 
senator, "but the gym Is for everybody " 

In other business; The Si udent Union Boaxdof Governors (SUBOG) is plannlnga 
Chicago Shopping trip for Nov 26. The cosl of the trip will be 117 tor activity card 
holders and JI3.75 lor non-activily card holders. For more information about the 
trip ask at the Sweet Shoppe in the Walb Memorial Union. 

Also. SUBOG is planning a Christmas dinner-dance on Dec. 9 at Ihc Shcralon 
Hotel. The band Cadillac will perform The cost of the dance will be W for activity

Jackson seen as 'power broker' 



By RANDY MISHLER 

Stalf Writer 

While Jessee Jackson has Utile 
chance of being Ihc Democratic can- 
didate in Ihc 1984 presidential election. 
he will be a "power broker" at the 
Democratic convention, possibly af- 
fecting the party's platform and even 
influencing who the Democrats 
nominate lo run against President 
Reagan, said Michael Dawns, associate 
professor of political science and chair 
of the department of polilical science. 

Jackson's power lo affect the election 



Mike Edmonds, president of the 
Black Collegiate Caucus, said his 
organization never endorsed a political 
candidate and hasn't decided if il would
