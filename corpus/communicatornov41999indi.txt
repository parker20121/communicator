MVP people 

by, Nattcy Simmonds, Staff Writer 

Lasi week, Mariano Rivera was named 
Most Valuable Player ot the 1999 World 
Scries. A right-handed pitcher for the New 
York Yankees, Rivera had an Impressive 
performance on Ihe mound, helping his 
team sweep the World Series. 

The naming of an MVP began at ihe 
end of the 1911 baseball season, Hugh 
Chalmers of Chalmers Motor Company 
decided lo give one of his automobiles lo 
one player in each league who "should 
prove himself as the most Important and 
useful player lo his club and to the league 
at large In point of deportment and value 
of services rendered," 

1 am not part of the professional base- 






lallots 



May and November. 1 got to thinking about 
the Most Valuable Player and wondered for 
whom I would vote In this year's game of 



movies, live seen amazing pliiys and aaves. 
I have beefl'tiiithiia'^y aitSeVfMVlf^u'or- 
expresslon. Unlike mosi people who choose 
celebrities and politicians as their MVP. I 
thoughi my vote should be a little closer lo 

I'm a neiv student ai IPFW. I haven't 
been In a university classroom in j-ears. 1 
sat In my beginning drawing class with slu- 
denis fresh out of high school art classes or 
wlih arilsilc Job experience. Our First class- 
room prolect was a great challenge for me 
I felt Inadequate and spent a great deal of 
the drawing time talking lo myself and 
pulling out all of the self-afflrmlng mantras 
I could ihink of. An hour and a half later, 
the tesi of the class put down their drawing 
pencils and took a break. 

A young girl came up behind mc, 
looked at my work and said, 'Wow,- In that 
one word of admiration, I shed all of my 
personal concerns, Sue's comment was Ihe 
encouragement I needed to remain In Ihe 
class and lake a siep toward my dteam. 

I started a new Job this year, I haven't 
been In the workforce for a while and was 
discouraged by friends and family lo do so, 
1 heard horror stories right and lefi of Idloi 
bosses, sniping co-workers and ihp 
drudgery of nlnc-to-flve life. 

They were wrong. 1 have the best Job 
on campus and the best supervisor In the 
world, Janci Is encouraging, palleni and 
smart. She also has a sense of humor, 
which Is probably the best quality a person 
can have, 

Vou may have seen my third nominee 
around Keliler Hall. Every day, she comes 
Inio my office with a smile on her face. 
■Another day another dollar,- she says. 1 
see her push her supply carl and clean 
windows on Ihe first floor of Kciller. 
Fcnonally. 1 view cleaning as a thankless 
Job and It is Ihe very tasi thing I ever want 
10 do, Eiel. who Is 80 year^ old, will have 
been working on the custodial staff of IPFW 
for SO years come next April, She has my 
undying admiration for slicking wlih her 
Job for all that time. She Is an example of 
perseverance and loyally to everyone. 

Encouragomeni, creating a comfort- 
able work environment, loyalty and 
dependability are all admirable qualities. 
Ail of these women deserv'e an MVP award, 
I'll let Ihem know 1i. 

Who Is your MVP? Take a moment to 
consider the people who have touched 
your life over the past year and In some 
way, honor your Most Valuable Player.

I was first introduced to British

television shows

PBS 39 airs "Brllcoms" Monday 
ugh Friday from 11-11:30 p.m. 
on Saturdays from 8-10 p,m, 1 
usually try to catch the two hours of

those episodes are a repeal of the ones 
on the weekdays, 

3ritish sitcom was flrsi produced in the 
of the episodes made before 1 was even 
ningly Innocently made doublc-cnton- 
i|| off the longues of ihe cast members In "Are You 
Being Served," a comedy revolving around the experi- 
ences of the employees of the men's and women's cloth- 
ing dcparimenis of the Grace Bros, Store, 

One of my favorite episodes of this program Is when 
an altempi Is made by another firm to take over Grace 
Bros, Once the staff members realize ihat their Jobs may 
■be in danger, they beglh 'ploiling ways t6 prevWt the 
shareholdtrs from voting In favor of Ihc takeover. Wlih

floor assistant. Mr. Lucas (Trevor Bannister), lakes over 
as head waiter. Chipper Mr. Humphries (John Inman) Is 
overwhelmed by the dinner planned for the e\enlng and 
exclaims, "If 1 don'l find a tin opener, it's going to be a

soup for dinner,* All ends well, as Lord Stableforth, a 
shareholder represenied by NIr. Harmon (one of ihe 
store's JanlloT3), voles to halt the takeover and continue 
Ihe meal at a nearby restaurant. 

Another comedy that 1 greatly cn|oy Is "Keeping Up

(pronounced bouquet), a would-be social climber, always 
concerned with how she and her family present them- 
selves. Unfortunately tor poor Hyacinth, two of her sis-

1 find British comedies lo be a breath of fresh air 
from Ihe American sitcoms created In the past few years. 
The wUiy. almosi slapstick humor of ihese shows Is a bli

As I recolL It was 75

1 don'i like the weather situation and I

there Is noihlng I can do to change this 
Issue. I think that we should use the weath- 
er In Indiana as an example of situations 
that happen In our everyday lives. One day 
It Is sunny and warm and the ne.vi day it 
snows. This is an example of how my life 
goes and most likely everyone else's. 

One week Ihe car Is running properly, 
all the bills are paid off and every deadline 
has been met. The world could not be more 
perfect. You think to yourself, "Hey, every- 
thing Is Just fine. I don't have to worry." 
Then the nexl week comes along and the 
car's brakes are gone, you find yourself 
with a horrible cold and you liave to miss

Features E(S1or 



The IPFW Department of 
Theatre will preicnt the play 
"Spike Heelx' at B p.m.. Nov. 
5,6,12 and 13. Performancei 
will take plare In the Studio 
Theatre, located In Room G3Z 
orKeitlcrlfall. 

The School of Fine and 
Performing Am gives this 
brief description of (he play: 
"Spike Heels" Is a modem-day 
Pygmalion aiiempi that goes 
awry In this contemporary 
comedy of manners which 
explores sexual harassment, 
misplaced romance and the 
endless possibilities In a four- 
sided love triangle.' 

The main character. 
Gcorgle, Is a resourceful 
woman "from the wrong side 
of the tracks." By wearing 



flashy shoes that make her 
taller and show off her legs, 
Georgle manipulates her 
Image In a way that causes the 
other characters to question 
some of their assumptions 
about class and gender. The 
other characters Include 
Edward, an attorney with 
questionable ethics; Andrew, 
Georgle's would-be mentor; 
and Lydia, Edward's Former 
fiancee. Throughout the play, 
Georgle uses her appearance 
and her spike heels as a way 
to empower herself in the 
midst of se.xual objecuncaiion 
and dismissal. 

In IPFWs production of 
"Spike Heels." Bridget Banncc 
takes on the role of LydIa, 
John Crewdson Is Edward. Dan 
P. Ambrose portrays Andrew 
and Sarah M. Lankcnau plays 

A 1998 Larry Siarks 
review of the Actors- 



Workshop of Boston perfor- 
mance of "Spike Heels" is 
located at hltpy/iA'ww.theater- 
mirror.com/heels.htm. 

In this review, Siarks 
writes of Georgle: "Those spike 
heels that Georgle wears 'to 
make my legs look dangerous' 
even though they hurt her 
feet are the symbol of every- 
thing she docs to please men 
— even though she is trivial- 
ized into a sex-object in the 
bargain. She Is the center of 
this swiftly witty play. She is 
willing to be what people 
think she is, so long as that 
gets her what she wants, but 
eventually what she thinks of 
herself, and what she really 
wants, is the central question." 

The author of "Spike 
Heels," Theresa Rebeck, is a 
well-known screenwriter and 
plaj-wrighi. Rebeck currently 
writes and produces for televi- 
sion's "NYPD Blue.'' She has 



"Dream On" and "Brooklyn 
Bridge." Rebeck's film credits 
include the screenplay 
"Harriet the Spy." Along with 
"Spike Heels," Rebeck has wTit- 
len the plays "Loose Knit" and 
"The Family Mann", as well as 
"Sunday on the Rocks." 

"Spike Heels" contains

by Nancy SimmontJs 

SlaH Writer 

Poet Helen Frost Joined the AAUW- 
IPFW Book Group Tuesday at noon to dis- 
cuss "Why Darkness Seems So Light: 
Young People Speak Out About Violence." 
Frost worked with the YWCA in conjunc- 
tion with their Week Without Violence 
awareness campaign in compiling essays 
by area high school students describing 
how violence has touched their lives. 

Frost spent one week each at the 
Alternative Learning Program, Heritage. 
Homestead, North Side, South Side and 
Wayne High Schools. Students were asked 
to write stories in response to the ques- 
tion. "Have you ever been personally 
affccicd by violence?" The 40 stories in 
the book represent a range of experl* 
enccs and emotions echoed by the Z49 
essays completed as part of the projecL 
These are stories of physical and verbal 
violence in the home, gang violence, 
rape, abduction and murder. 

In her introduction to the book, 
Frost mentions the concerns of portray- 
ing such a negative picture of our com- 
munit&gt;', "Many students were reluctant to 
tell stories about their friends and fami- 
H^,,y,et.whea they listened to each 
other's stories, they often found relief in 
knowing others had been through similar 
experiences." Frost hopes that the stories 
will open discussion about violence and 
help bring communities to a greater 



Violence is not uncommon. Many 
people have became casual about it. The 
title of the book. "Why Darkness Seems 
So Light." raises a question that many are 
tr&gt;ing to answer. Frost writes, "If dark- 
ness Is all around us, these stories sug- 
gest It begins to seem light. In both sens- 
es. We cease to recognize it as darkness, 
and we become unaware of its weight on 

The discussion group was interested 
in the process of the project and asked 
how Frost could, in such a short amount 
of time, bring young people to share such 
indmate details of their lives. 

Frost said that most young people 
never told anyone about these experi- 
ences; they felt no one eared to listen. 
She repeatedly heard an expression of 
grartiude in asking them lo speak about 
this "taboo" subject. She instructed the 
students In writing anonymouslj', with a 
pseudonym, or in a fictional manner in 
order not onlj' to provide a safe environ- 
ment for them to speak, but to protect 
themselves. She said that of all the essays 
she read, she guessed that only one or 
two wrote something that had never hap- 
pened. Whether writing fictionally or 
anonymously, she looked for the essen- 
tial truth. In their experiences and. includ- 
ed stories in the book that spoke with "an 
authentic voice." 

Many of the stories expressed "if 
only" feelings. These young people, how- 
ever illogicall&gt;. are blaming themselves 



for outcomes of which they had no con- 
trol. These are kids with a conscience and 
the weight of violence can be hcaiy. 

In Frost's work with the Fort Wayne 
Dance Collective she spends time with 
the young people at Wood Youth Center. 
She said that more kids than one would 
expect do something to ensure their 
admittance to Wood. They know' they can 
get three meals a day there, as well as be 
in a safe environment. This is not possi- 
ble In their homes. 

In addition to this book, the project 
also prompted a play co-authored and 
directed by Harvey Cocks of the Fort 
Wayne Youtheatre. The script has been 
published, and upon request has been 
sent to other communit&gt; theaters. 

'Why Darkness Seems So Light" Is 
published by Pecan Grove Press and is 
available at bookstores. 

The AAUW-IPFW Book Discussion 
Group next meets on Nov. 23 at noon in 
Ketiler. Room 101 to discuss Carol 
Anway's book. "Daughters of Another 
Path." Anway writes of her daughter's 
conversion to Islam, how it affected her 
family and how other families have 
responded to this situation. The book 
includes information about Islam and its 
practice, as well as a chapter on what 
these women would like non-Muslims to 
know about their faith.
