INDIANA-PURDUE UNIVERSITY, FORT 



Committee develops plans 
for academic autonomy 



By REX PUTT 

After three years of study and 
research the Academic Structure 
Development Committee has develop- 
ed a plan for an autonomous 
university to be presented to the 
Purdue Faculty Senate at Fort 
Wayne. 

Dr. 0. Franklin Kenworthy, 
chairman of the ASD committee, 
described the new plan as "a nice 
plan that recognizes unique needs of 
this campus." 

Kenworthy strongly supports the 
new academic structure. He said 
"We've (the committee) worked or it 



for three years and we feel it serves 
the needs of students very well. There 
are still many things the community 
would like to have more autonomy on, 
but there are limits set by Purdue of 
Lafayette." 

He went on to evaluate the 
necessity of a new academic plan. 
"Everybody should put aside the old 
unless the old does the job." He 
continued to point out that the old ( the 
present system) is definitely not 
doing the proper job, so it should be

Some big news 
from One A.D. 



By SAM STEWART 

(History records that St. Luke 
was a physician, not a newspaper- 
man, but his work in the Gospel 
according to St. Luke is still regarded 
as a good story by a good reporter. 
Still, one can't help wondering how a 
20th Century newsman would have 
reported the event we celebrate 
today. Maybe something like this...) 

BETHLEHEM, Judea -The rela- 
tionship of unprecedented wonders in 
the heavens over Judea to the birth of 
a child in Bethlehem was being 
studied today. 

That more than coincidence was 
involved was established by the 
stories of eye-witnesses. 

These facts stand out from a 
piecing-together of background infor- 

Because of a decree from Caesar 
Augustus that all the world should be 
taxed, citizens everywhere had con- 
verged upon their own cities to pay 
their taxes. The decree had been 
handed along to the people through 
Cyrenius, governor of Syria. 

Among those coming to Bethle- 
hem to pay their tax was Joseph, who 
had come from Galilee, out of the City 
of Nazareth, unto Bethlehem, the City 
of David, inasmuch as he was of the 
house and lineage of David. 

Joseph, accompanied by his 
expectant wife, Mary, arrived late in 
Bethlehem and found housing imposs- 
ible to obtain. Rooms everywhere 
were taken by the scores of citizens in 
town to pay their taxes. 

One Bethlehem innkeeper, recog- 
nizing the situation and sympathetic 
with the travelers' plight, granted 
them the use of his stable for the 
night. 

-, It was in this stable that Mary 
brought forth her first-born son. She 
wrapped him in swaddling clothes, 
routine procedure for the times, and 
laid him in a manger. 

This, by itself, might have stirred 



How they came to leave the 
country and hasten to Bethlehem is 
told in this interview with one of the 
shepherds: 

"There we were, when the Angel 
of the Lord came upon us, and the 
glory of the Lord shone all around us. 
I'll be frank about it - we were 
frightened almost out of our wits. 

"Then the Angel said, 'Fear not; 
for behold I bring you tidings of great 
joy, which shall be to all people. For 
unto you is born this day a Saviour, 
which is Christ the Lord.' You can 
imagine how we felt." 

The Angel gave specific instruct- 
ions, the shepherd said, continuing: 

"He said to watch for a sign. He 
assured us that we would find the 
babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, 
lying in a manger. I'll admit we were 
more puzzled than impressed, at this 

"Then," the shepherd went on, 
"suddenly there was with the Angel a 
multitude of the heavenly host 
praising God, and saying, 'Glory to 
God in the highest, and on earth 
peace, good will toward men!'" 

All the shepherds, by their own 
statements, were deeply impressed 
and talked among themselves about 
the next step they should take. As 
each recalled it, they said to one 
another : 



"Let 



go

There were shepherds abiding in 
their fields, keeping watch over their 
flocks by night, certainly unprepared 
for what was to come, and resigned to 
the boredom of another night guard- 
ing their sheep. 



Bethlehem, and see this thing which is 
come to pass, which the Lord hath 
made known unto us. We came as fast 

"And sure enough, we found 
Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying 
in a manger." 

The shepherds lost no time in 
spreading the word about the child 
and what they had heard about Him; 
they admit to encountering some 
raised eyebrows. 

Before they returned, glorifying 
and praising God for all the things 
they had heard and seen, the 
shepherds met with the press and one 
of them expressed the mood which 
seemed to prevail through Judea that 

"It was an experience I shall 
never forget. I am only a poor 
shepherd, but I am convinced I was 
privileged to be in on the start of 
something big." 



IU-PU to ask for 
more money 



Indiana-Purdue will be asking for 
an additional appropriation from the 
General Assembly when it meets in 
January. The IU-PU request is part of 
an 511.7 million request by the 
Indiana Commission on Higher Edu- 
cation for all state-supported univers- 
ities in Indiana. 

IU-PU's money, if granted, will 
be used primarily for 5 per cent 
faculty salary increments for the next 
fiscal year. 

Although IU-PU will be on a 
unified budget next year, the two 
schools placed separate requests with 
the legislature. Purdue has asked for 
5170,325. I.U.'s figure was not 
available. 



According to Roger J. Manges, 
dean and director of Purdue here, the 
additional allocation and increased 
faculty increments will not result in a 

reported by one of the city newspap- 
ers earlier this week. 

"We're trying to respond to a real 
need on the part of faculty that we 
have not been fiscally able to respond 
to at an earlier time," said James E. 
Gilbert, associate dean for academic 
affairs for Purdue here. 

The additional funding request 
will go before the upcoming legisla- 
tive session. If approved, the addition- 
al money will be used in the fiscal 
year beginning July 1, 1974. 



approval. The committee, which has 
11 members (all of whom are 
associated with the Purdue faction of 
Indiana-Purdue, was originally form- 
ed in 1970 with the approval of the 
Purdue University administration in 
Lafayette. 

The new system calls for what Dr. 
Kenworthy describes as "a university 
with two major colleges. Under these 
colleges will be Curriculum Councils 
which are responsible for making 
curriculum decisions for allied de- 
partments. These councils will act as 
curriculum funnels." 

Besides the two major colleges, 



programs will be referred t 



The two colleges, which will be 
referred to as the College of Applied 
Studies, and the College of Arts &amp; 
Sciences will each be divided into 
Curriculum Councils. 

Arts &amp; Sciences will have 
Curriculum Councils of Behavioral St 
Social Sciences, Humanities and 
Sciences. Applied Studies will have 
Curriculum Councils of Engineering 
&amp; Engineering Technologies, Health 
Professions &amp; Paramedical Technolo- 
gies, and Education &amp; Service 
Technologies. 

All Curriculum Councils will 
consist of two or more departments 
and several of the departments will 
have different sections. 

For an example: in the College of 
Applied Studies there is the Curricu- 
lum Council of Education &amp; Service 
Technologies. Under this Curriculum 
Council is a department of Education. 
This department is in turn divided 
into sections of Audiology &amp; Speech 
Pathology, Home Economics, and 
Industrial Education. 



The main proposal of this new 
academic plan is to have a dean 
heading each college, and otie faculty 



senate representing both colleges. 
The faculty senate shall act as what 
Kenworth calls "the supreme court of 
the University." 

The new academic plan hasn't 
been actively publicized (as of the 
time this article was written), but 
many faculty members and adminis- 
trators on the Purdue side have at 
least had a chance to glance at the 
proposed document. 

Dr. Benjamin Becker, a professor 
of biology, was dissatisfied with 
several items he had the chance to 
examine. He feels that "there should 
be no elected Senate, but rather an 
organization that involves all faculty 
members." The plan proposed by the 
committee to form one Senate would 
decrease the number of faculty 
members representing the faculty. 

Becker also questioned which 
teachers would be the ones to go if the 
English departments, which are now 
separate, would be combined. "What 
will happen to Dean Manges and 



Roger J. Manges, dean and 
director of the Purdue faction of 
Indiana-Purdue, was asked to form a 
committee for the purpose of creating 
a structure that could hopefully serve 
the entire campus. In the early stages 
the Purdue committee met with 
Indiana representatives, but the 
progress of the two representatives in 
Fort Wayne was thwarted when there 



The reconstruction plan for a new 
academic structure had to be revised 
to suit the standards of the new 
administration. For awhile under new 
Purdue president Arthur Hansen, the 
action of the Fort Wayne committee 
was stymied. The faculty finally got 
the go-ahead to continue with the 
plan, so they quickly prepared the 
document for the new structure which 
they presented this week at the 
Purdue Faculty Senate meeting in 
Fort Wayne. 




The famous Circle K tub, which collected Jlfioo for a family

Indiana-Purdue University's nat- 
ional service fraternity. Circle K, is 
currently sponsoring a drive to raise 
donations for radio station WOWO's 
1973 Penny Pitch family. The organi- 
zation will take an old-fashioned 
bathtub on wheels to various locations 
in Fort Wayne in an effort to raise 
money for the needy family. 

On two Saturdays, December 15 
and 22, 1973, the Circle K group will go 
out into the Fort Wayne community to 
collect donations. On Saturday, Dec- 
ember 15, the bathtub will be at North 
K-Mart, Georgetown Square, Time 
Corners, and Southtown Mall. 



A week later Circle K members, 
alumni, and Kiwanis Club members 
will push the tub from the south Sears 
store to the downtown area, at the 
corner of Wayne and Calhoun Streets. 
On that same day another tub will be 
pushed from the Indiana-Purdue 
campus, also to the downtown area, 

The money collected will be 
donated to the WOWO Penny Pitch. 
Annually radio station WOWO spon- 
sors a needy family, asks for any size 
donation from anyone, and then buys 
much-needed items for the family. 
This year the Penny Pitch family 
includes a father, mother, and their 
five children, ranging in age from 
seven months to 12 years.

The committee voted to close its

for the addition of a black representa-

IU-PU will test a standardized 
exam schedule during final week, but 
one university staff member is 
pessimistic that the new system will 
work without considerable problems. 

The staff member, who asked not 
to be identified, expects a large 
number of scheduling problems to 
surface during finals, which will run 
next week, December 17-21. He cited 
the fact that there is no break time 
between one final and the next as a 

He also criticized the lack of 
contingency planning to handle such 
problems as two classes meeting in 
the same room at the same time to 
take different finals. The official said 
that the schedule did allow this to 
happen. 

IU-PU Registrar David Skelton 
disputed these charges when they 
were brought to his attention by the 

Regarding the two-finals-in-one-

checked that situation to make it a 

Skelton said that the new sched- 
ule was put through a dry run, and 
most of these problems were taken 
care of at that time. 

Dr. Skelton defended a standard- 
ized schedule because of the adminis- 
trative time saved. "This eliminates 
the need to put together a whole new 
schedule just for exam week," he 



45 minutes each. The faculty instruct- 
ed Skelton to increase the exam time 
to a full two hours, eliminating the 15 
minute breaks. According to Skelton, 
by that time it was too late to 
completely rework the schedule to 
allow for breaks. 

"It won't go without any prob- 
lems, but neither did any other exam 
schedule," said Skelton, adding that 
final week "should be relatively 
problem free as far as format is 



concerned." 

The standardized schedule as- 
signs most finals to the approximate 



i. This eliminates the need 
for students and faculty to remember 
a time and place that may be 
completely different from the regular 
class meetings. 

All instructors have been given 
the matrix which is used to determine 
the exact time for each final. They 
have been asked to inform their 
students of this time. 

The matrix is posted in the 
registration area for those who forget 
or want to double-check the informa- 
tion. The registration offices are 
located in the north wing of Kettler 
Hall on the ground floor. 

Any IU-PU student who has more 
than two finals on any one day can 
request that one of the exams be 
rescheduled. Likewise, if a student 
has two finals meeting at the same 
time, one can be taken at another 

Dr. Skelton said that a standard- 
ized schedule was instituted at the 
request of a number of faculty 
members. This schedule saved staff 
time, and according to Skelton, 
reduces the chance of a student 
having two finals at the same time. 

A standardized schedule also 
reduces the confusion of remember- 
ing when and where finals are to be 
given, said Skelton.

Changes for the spring 

Beginning with the January 14 issue, we will be making many 
changes in the stvle and format of the Communicator. The most 
significant change "will be a twice-weekly publishing format. We will 
come out on Mondays and Thursdays, hopefully around noon. The 
Thursday issue will be much like it has been this semester. The Monday 
issue will probably be only four or six pages, depending on the advertising 
volume for that issue. 

The sports page will add regular coverage of home Komet games. We 
also hope lo begin some coverage of Indiana and Purdue basketball, but 
this will probably not be on a steady basis. 

We will institute an entertainment page in the Thursday issue. This 
will feature leviews and columns of campus programs and off-campus 
items, such as records, chess, books, and other related matters. The page 
will also publish an activities calendar. Requirements for having events 
listed in this calendar are given elsewhere in this paper. 

The editorial page will offer two new sludenl columnists, and Dan 
Motto's Non-Prophet Corner will be moved to this page. 

We hope to resume coverage of city news items that concern this 
campus or are of general interest to our readership. Before we can do 
this, we need to hire a reporter with a good background in city 
government and community affairs. 

We also will be usmu the Indiana Collegiak' Press Association's news 
service to inform our readers of the happenings in Indianapolis during the 
General Assembly session in January and February. 

National issues that are of vital interest to our readers, such as the 
energy crisis and the Middle East, will be featured on both news and 
editorial pages in manner that will supplement other news sources. 

And, of course, we will increase our coverage of campus news. We 
will keep our readers up-to-date on such vital topics as the search for a 
new super-chancellor and business manager. We will be giving priority to 
stories concerning the future unification of this campus and the 
ramifications of that issue.

The energy demand on these 
newer appliances is much higher than 
the appliances of the 1950's as well. A

compared to a 1950's black and white 
wattage of 237. Air conditioners have 
wattages of 1,566, dishwashers 1,201 
and clothes dryers 4,856, much 
greater than older appliances like 
small refrigerators (241 watts), 
radios (71 watts) or food mixers (127 

We can help save energy and 
money if we keep our appliances in 
good working order. Consult the 
owner's manual for detailed informa- 
tion about operating and maintaining 
your appliances. Be sure to have your 
furnace checked once a year and 
change the filters frequently during 
use. Defrost your freezer as soon as 
the ice buildup reaches one-fourth 

If you are going to purchase a new 
appliance, perhaps for a Christmas 
present, consider the energy efficien- 
cy of the various models in addition to 
their color and utility. The energy and 
efficiencies of heating systems, 
air -conditioners, refrigerators and 
other major appliances vary consid- . 
erably from one model to another. 
Shop around, requesting information 
on energy efficiency and operation 
costs of the models you are consider- 
ing. 

This is not as difficult as it 
sounds. Many manufacturers already 
voluntarily label appliances accord- 
ing to their energy efficiency. 
Although the more efficient may cost 



more, it is likely to save enough 
energy to pay for the extra initial 
expense. 

The House of Representatives' 
Subcommittee on Energy tells me 
that side-by-side refrigerator-freez- 
ers and upright full size freezers are 
often the least efficient models. In 
addition, they have found that 
frost-free refrigerators and freezers 
consume up to fifty percent more 
electricity than conventional models. 
They also note that stoves, clothes 
cryers and water heaters that use gas 
consume less total energy than do 
their electric counterparts.

As is evidenced by all but the 
weather, the Christmas season has 
once again made its presence known. 
While all around us we perceive 
shortages of some sort, the acknow- 
lendged length of the yule season has 
been steadily increasing. Long before 
Thanksgiving the commercials begin 
blaring their glaring sales pitch to an 
admittedly indignant yet thoroughly 
receptive public The mad rush to lay- 
away gifts, with no charge, of course, 
creates an increasing momentum to 
incorporate even those who show 
reluctance to the tide. 

To what has Christmas evolved 
that we revere this above all days'" 
From a purely commercial view, the 
sales during this time are supreme 
above all events. Even the total sales 
from the combined birthdays come 
nowhere close. The show we see 
during this time, the proliferation of 
innumerable Santas, snowmen, and 
silver angels, lends a vaudevillian 
touch lacking in the other eleven 
months. Good theatre of sorts, 
escapism from the doldrums of 
despair, and a time to recoup and 
regroup for the advent of yet another 

Christmas seems to have evolved 
into an artificial panorama of tinsel, 
wildly blinking colored lights and 
glaring neon signs proclaiming cheer, 
peace and good will toward men. All 
to little avail. Peace, cheer and good 
will toward men seem as distant 
today as does the comet Kohoutek. 
The season of giving to many centers 
around the dilemma of trying to find 
the perfect gift for the person who has 
everything. This problem is in most 
cases solved by merely purchasing a 
more elaborate and expensive item of 
what one already possesses. Nice, but 
in most instances only superfluous. 

Fortunately, the Spirit of Christ- 
mas has not been totally lost. Even 
with the overpowering presence of the 
artificial, many bright spots emerge. 
The many organizations and indivi- 
duals who perform innumerable acts 

" kindness and generosity show that 
people are still willing to give that 
most precious of gifts: themselves. 
Giving of their time and also their 
financial resources where needed is 
the outward expression of that inner 
love toward those who are, to say the 
least, less fortunate than themselves. 
The range of activities is almost as 
diversified as those involved. From 
jthe grand programs such as WOWO 
Penny Pilch and those conducted by 
the Salvation Army, local corpora- 
ions and labor unions, to the simple

Mortuary art of living 



By RICHARD SOKOLOWSKI 



Envious of other nations' art of 
life, American architects finally 
succeeded in endowing the U.S. with 
the cheapest, newest, and best 
mortuary art of living. 

It did not happen over one electric 
day, but slowly has evolved to its 
present greatness. The transition 
period is best exemplified by I.U. 
Purdue's new library. The goal - 
windowless structure, is here only 
partly achieved, windows being 
raised above human heads The next 
step will be to remove them 
completely, following the best exam- 
_• pie of Lake Mortuary House, Medical- 
Dental Center of Lake Avenue, 
I.U.-Purdue classrooms 



Leo Road, and other like buildings 
spring up all over Fort Wayne. 

This evolution was socially neces- 
sary, since our library's raised 
windows caused giraffe-like growth of 
the necks of the readers, caused by 
primitive, anti-American, undevelop- 



; clouds, 



anxiety about after-life, 
catacombs resembling offices remind 
constantly its occupants about death, 
thus making it easier to relocate, an 
important fact in our high-death-rate 
society . 



It also serves a useful purpose of 
muffling the shouts of patients being 
robbed by our leading dental and 
medical industry. Religious feelings 
are also born, due to the eternal 
aspect of the 8 hour working day, 
which thus seems endlessly long, 
without the distraction of looking on 
something natural, except on silent 
rows of tomb-like buried files. 

The success of the new architec- 
ture is proved by the wish of the 
I.U .-Purdue architect and the approv- 
ing committee to leave their pre- 
progress large-windowed houses, in 
order lo spend the rest of their life in 
walled seclusion of the reading

Singers defend Dickens Dinner 



To the Editor: 

There is apparently no end to the 
Communicator's potential for attack- 
ing any person or organization of this 
campus connected with any form of 
art. Only a few weeks back it was the 
campus literary magazine, of which I 
am editor; now the victim-elect is 
University Singers, and the charge is 
NEGLECTING THE STUDENTS. 

In the first place, Franke is in 
incredibly poor taste in using his 
column as propaganda space; he had 
ought to bully the senate into carrying 
out his whims more subtly, or at least 
elsewhere and nti under the inept 
guise of journalism. 

In the second, procedures regard- 
ing this year's ticket sales were made 
clear to everyone, and Dickens 
Dinner is not a capitalistic adventure; 
at best we wdl break even. Therefore 
these rantings of students being 
ignored or ripped off, as it were, are 
pure silliness. Discount prices for 
students would be nice but probably 
impossible ; one would have to discuss 
the matter with the head of the Music 
Department, which Franke apparent- 
ly has not done; he has in classic 
Communicator style merely begun 
shooting venom before even research- 
ing his target. As for the suggestion 
that we are neglecting the students 
and playing up to the community, 
Franke might do well to attend some 
of our performances and see for 
himself that the students on this 
campus are apparently more interest- 
ed in acid rock than music; the 
students are always in a pronounced 
minority while the community seems 
more interested. 

Regarding the incidental sum 
allocated Singers by the senate, 
Franke need not try to fool anyone 
into thinking that this money is 
allocated out of concern for Singers or 
for music. It is allocated because a 
group of bright-eyed singers to 
bounce onstage and chant briefly at 
university functions is a necessary 
status symbol to any campus. Beyond 
that, the senate could care less about 
Singers; music is a background item 
to our senate and students, and we 
have consistently been treated as a 
background group, at best an 
eccentric fringe whenever we ab 
andoned the Johnny Mann image for 
the Anton Bruckner. Franke had 
ought to take a closer look at who is 
neglecting whom. 

The most disgusting thing about 
this editorial is the assumption 
inherent in it that a few foreboding 
words from Franke are going to strike 
fear into the hearts of University 
Singers and make them cower 
frantically into doing whatever 
Franke in his self-appointed role as 
God deems should be done. If his 
Word would be enough to have all of 
our senate money cut off and he could 
by some Nixonic alliance with the 
administration foreclose all of our 
equipment, sheet music, and cos- 
tumes, the campus can rest assured 
that Harper and his eccentrics would 



still have their voices and would 
rather calmly borrow a pitch pipe and 
go about the business of getting ready 
for the spring Brahms concert— this 
latest piece of journalistic porno- 
graphy has only served to further 
alienate Singers from the student 
body, a sad situation indeed, when 
both parties could draw so much from 
the artistic achievement that is the 
purpose of University Singers. 

S. M. BRATTAIN 

To the Editor: 

I confess that I was rather taken 
aback by your editorial, of Thursday 



of the truth? 

1. The Dickens Dinner will not be 
held December 10. 

2. The University Singers did not 
receive the sum you indicated from 
student activity monies, but rather a 
figure some one thousand dollars less. 

3. This sum is used to further the 
work of the Singers, not to subsidize 
the Dinner. The Dickens Dinner must 
be self-supporting since it is not 
budgeted by the Student Senate. 

4. Students did in fact have 
priority for ticket purchase, since 
they are in a position to deliver ticket 
requests personally, whereas outsid- 
ers have to use the mail. 

5. It is perhaps unreasonable to 
draw conclusions about the attitudes 
of the Director of the Singers in the 
face of the fact that Dr. Harper has 
been out of the country for some 
months. You may attribute any 
deficiencies in the organisation of the 
dinner this year to the fact that the 
work is being performed by volun- 
teers, such as the undersigned, who 
are working to preserve a campus 
tradition of which many people have 
become fond and where generates a 
very positive impression in the 
community. 

6. The Student Senate has no 
investment in the Dickens Dinner per 
se. The Senate budgets the Singers, 
but it does not budget catering nor 



Certainly, it would be good if 
more people could attend the Dickens 
Dinner. The problem is that the 
'break-even point' is at 100 per cent of 
capacity: every seat must be filled, 
every meal must be paid for. The 
expansion of the dinners so that 1050 
tickets were offered (rather than the 
current 700) would involve a financial 
risk. Would the Student Senate be 
prepared to underwrite this risk? I 
hope so. After all the flack we get 
about 'Hippie Heaven' and 'Mari- 
juana Tech' we certainly need to 
encourage those organisations which 
show the public a truer, more 
attractive, aspect of our campus 
community.

Doctor's Bag 

By ARNOLD WERNER, M.D. 

QUESTION : This summer a half dozen of us hitch hiked to 
the Rocky Mountains to spend some time camping. One of 
our group started a rumor that had the girls freaked out and 
the fellows reluctant to camp near the women. She 
maintained that bears are attracted to women during their 
menstrual period and in more than just an amorous fashion. 
We knew enough to hang our food up high and away from 
camp, but with all the stuff about women's liberation, it 
seemed unrealistic to expect the women to put up with 
similar treatment. Was there a real need for caution and 
what could we have done about it? 

ANSWER: The longer I write this column the more I 
become convinced that the questions are actually much 
better than the answers. This particular concern sent me 
scrambling for some data which turned out to be hard to 
come by. One summer in the late 1960's two women 
backpacking in Glacier National Park were attacked by a 
grizzly bear. One of the women was menstruating at the 
time. The wildlife expert I spoke with confirmed this story 
and recalled hearing one or two other similar reports. 
Needless to say, the fact that the women were menstruating 
and were subsequently attacked by the bear does not 
necessarily indicate a causal relationship, it easily could 
have been a coincidence. As well, the bear might have been 
attracted by bacon or other odoriferous food stuffs, a more 
likely occurance when the natural food supply for animals 

Grizzly bears are known to attack even though 
apparently unprovoked but the more usual black bear found 
in many parts of this country does not usually attack unless 
bothered. Getting between a bear and its cubs constitutes 
being bothered. 

Attacks by animals on campers, including back 
packers, are extraordinarily rare. On this basis alone, it 
would seem there was little source for concern. Camping in 
the more populous parts of the country would give little 
reason for concern, the greater threat to tranquility coming 
from other campers. I cannot give you absolute 
reassurance on the behavior of grizzlies in the Rocky 
Mountains. 



QUESTION: My husband is a graduate student who has just 
been awarded a minor but significant honor. He is pleased 
and proud and I am trying to think of a surprise celebration, 
but my husband doesn't like to celebrate anything-birth- 
days, Christmas, weddings, graduations, anything. 

Why is it that some men are simply unable to loosen up 
and enjoy being fussed over, or enjoy making a fuss over 
someone else? It is frustrating to be so excited for my 
husband and yet to know that a gift, part or a dinner out 
would meet with polite indifference. 

ANSWER: This is a complex problem. Some people, and it 
seems to be men more often than women, have been 
brought up to believe that the expression of feelings, happy 
ones as well as sad ones, is generally unacceptable. Such 
people are made very uncomfortable by attention or 
recognition which would call forth from them some 
expression of appreciation. On the other hand, tremendous 
uncertainty about one's own abilities can result in 
significant feelings of discomfort every time a success 
Occurs. Since such people might not feel they deserve 
success, any fuss made over them just increases their 
discomfort. In the statement about your husband being 
proud of his accomplishment this certainly does not appear 
to be the case. 

I have seen it happen that such an incredible fuss is 
made over all events, be they anniversaries or 
accomplishments, that all but the most vain would be 
acutely embarrassed. A few such occurances can easily 
condition a person to prefer a private sense of self 
fulfillment rather than other people's overexuberance. 
Rather than take responsibility for making a fuss over your 
husband, you might try giving him an opportunity to plan 
with you in doing something special you both enjoy as a

THE CONTINUING SAGA OF CHARLIE O. 

The Oakland A's have annexed two straight world championships. 
Their owner is Charlie 0. Finley. affectionately known as "Charlie the 

Thus you might deduce that Finley is a great sports mastermind. But 
some say that the Athletics did the job in spite of Mr. Finley. Let's take a 
brief closer look at this millionaire from La Porte, Indiana. 

He is the owner of the Memphis Tarns of the ABA. The Tarns for 
several years have been the worst team in the league, both 
performance-wise and financially. 

He is the owner of the California Golden Seals of the NHL. The Seals 
are in the same boat as the ABA Tarns, and NHL owners are trying to buy 
out the west coast franchise from Mr. Finley before he does any more 
bungling. 

He also was owner of the Columbus Seals of the International Hockey 
League. The team did so badly that Finley decided to get out. Thank God, 
because one more year of his rule could well have resulted in the severe 
financial crippling of the entire league. 

Incidentally, this year under new leadership the Seals are recovering 

Charlie, why dont you set up your empire somewhere else? Like, say, 
Juneau, Alaska, for example. 

VETERAN QBS FINALLY GIVEN A CHANCE 

For years veteran quarterbacks John Hadl and Charley Johnson 
toiled in the far background of Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, and 
Company. They put the tallies on the board for their losing clubs, but 
always seemed to come out on the short end of something like a 45-30 

The offense was there but the recognition was not. Hadl endured 
many a losing, frustrating season with the defense-less San Diego 
Chargers. And Johnson worked fulilely for eons with the hapless Houston 

But in 1973 both professionals have at last been given the chance to 
prove their worth while playing for real winners. 

The results are fast coming in : Hadl is currently the leading passer in 
the NFL and has led the Los Angeles Rams to a powerful 10-2 mark. He 
has lifted the Rams into serious contention for the Super Bowl. 

Johnson has been the key factor in Denver's rise into contention in the 
AFC West Division. He must have had to look up such terms as "win," 
"victory," "cheer," and "stardom" before the season started, as those 
words were unknown in Houston, Texas, 

INDIANAPOLIS NOT ALL THAT BAD 

For the past several years Indianapolis has been considered as a 
possible site for major league baseball, football and hockey franchises. 
However, interested parties have always shied away from Indy because 
of its lack of past success in minor league classifications. 

But one major league sports team, the Indiana Pacers of the 
American Basketball Association, has tested the Indiana city and has 
found a home, 

The Pacers have won the ABA championship in three of the last four 
years. At times during that span the Pacers looked like anything but a 
champion team. But the fans have always turned out in capacity numbers 
at the Indiana State Fairgrounds to support their major league basketball 

This year, through the first 30 contests, the Pacers have been just a 
.500 club. Yet whenever they battle ABA foes at home, the attendance 
rarely dips below the 9,000 mark. 

VACATION WISHES 

Here's hoping that all Indiana-Purdue students have a long and 
satisfying vacation period. Inevitably the energy crisis will be on 
everyone's mind, but hopefully the situation will improve as the new year 
sets in. At any rate, if you've got the gas, drive carefully. 

As you celebrate the season give a little thought to the families of the 
hundreds of men still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia. And pray that 
Golda and the Arabs find the true meaning and bliss of peace.

IU-PU rally falls short 

Indiana-Purdue played one of 
their usual flat first halves and fell 
short in a spirited second half rally as 
they were defeated by Northwood 
Institute, 106-81 in a college basket- 
ball game Thursday night at the 
Concordia Senior College gymnas- 

Northwood took advantage of the 
Mastodon cold first half by going to 
the boards and scoring on many 
offensive rebounds. The Mastodon 
guards, Dean Putt, Gary Daub, and 
Gary Trump did most of the first half 
scoring, as the Mastodons fell behind 
by 21 at the intermission. 

Northwood took an early 12-6 
lead, and used their offensive 
rebounds strength and a good 
shooting percentage to extend their 
lead to 24-9. Indiana-Purdue came 
back behind the fabulous shooting of 
guards Trump and Putt to narrow the 
deficit to 10 points, but with the score 
33-23, the Northwood five again hit a 
hot streak as forwards Weeks and 
Weber scored consistently from short 
range. The Mastodons went cold, 
throwing the ball away and making 
other miscues that benefited the 
opposition. The half time score ended 
at 56-35. 

Indiana-Purdue came out strong 
in the second half and nearly hustled 
the visitors out of the gym. Captains 
Rex Putt and Gary Trump ignited a 
torrid fast break that along with a 
rugged full court man to man press 
brought the Mastodons back into 
contention. Dean Putt continued to 
score, and forwards Grussing, Gray 
and Peterson all contributed to the 
rally that was a reversal of the first 
half play. The Northwood lead was 
cut down to 10 points at one time, and 
still didn't look secure when the 
Mastodon's leading scorer, Rex Putt, 
fouled out with over five minutes to 
go. 

Northwood led by 15 with a little 
over four minutes left to play, so with 
little hope of a victory Coach 
Wehrmeister sent in a new squad to 
finish it up. 



long outside shots, and guard Gary 
Trump had a fine night with 16 points 
Forward Hex Putt shook off a bad 
first half with 10 second half points 
and Gary Gray added 9. 

Weber was the big gun for 
Norlhwood with an impressive 35 
points, and Weeks and Snow added 22 
and 21. 



and enthusiasm. 

Members of the team of judges 
were Terry Kundysek, Rollie Clem- 
ents, Jerry Hetrick, Gary Trump, Dr 
Jack Kirby, Dr. Edwin Leonard, and 
Dr. Judy Kamnikar. 

Alice Thomas, a sophomore, will 
serve as captain of the squad. "I hope 
we can get as much participation as 
passible from the students and faculty 
at the games," she commented. 

The squad will cheer at all IU-PU 
gasketball games, both home and 
away. Plans also indicate that the 
girls will be at soccer and baseball 
games. They are being advised by 
Judy Kamnikar. 

Georgia Ward, assistant squad 
captain, is a sophomore majoring in 
nursing. She stated, "It would be 
great if the students at IU-PU could 
get out there and support their 

Both Char Snearing, a senior 
majoring in art education, and Pam 
Craig, a junior in Germanic lan- 
guages, also expressed hopes of 
increased student support at games. 
"Most people have never been to a 
gameand the team does need backing 
from the student body," said Char. 

Pam called for student attend- 
ance at the games, "Let's all get out 
there and show them we're backing 

To generate more spirit and 
support for the athletic teams, the 
squad hopes to form a booster club. 
Students who might be interested are 
asked to leave their names at the 
Student Services office or at the 
athletic office in the Student Union. 



Mastodons score 100, lose 

The Indiana-Purdue Mastodons 
performed very well as thev rebound- 
ed from an early 20-point deficit, but 
still lost 114-110 as they ran into foul 
trouble against a rugged squad from 
Spring Arbor in a Saturday night 
game at the Central gym. 

Highly-favored Spring Arbor had 
taken a quick 20-2 lead early in the 
game, but a tenacious offensive rally 
led by leading Mastodon scorer Rex 
Putt, and a spirited defense which 
forced Spring Arbor to turn the ball 
over time after time closed the gap 
and turned the premature run-away 
victory into a barn-burner. The 
Mastodon squad was loudly cheered 
throughout the game by a sizeable 
crowd in their first home game of the 
season. An all-male cheering section 
added an additional inspiration to the 

Spring Arbor brought their own 
cheering section along and acted as 
though they were going to blow the 
hosts out of the gym as they put 20 
quick points on the board while the 
Mastodons could only manage one 
bucket. Indiana-Purdue called time 
out with over 15 minutes to go in the 
half, but still couldn't get the offense 
together. They fell down by as much 
as 28-6 before they finally decided to 

Captains Rex Putt and Gary 
Trump took charge and helped the 
Mastodons to gain on the visitors. 
Trump, who only stands 5'9", but was 
moved to forward by Coach Wehr- 
meister because of his outstanding 
jumping ability, made several key 
plays that brought the Mastodons 
within 13 at 40-27 with nearly five 
minutes remaining in the hall. The 
rest of the half was all Indiana- 
Purdue as they outscored the visitors 
vith Rex Putt netting nearly 



second half, but forwards Rex Putt 
and Keith Mendenhall (who at 5'10" 
was playing forward for about the 
first time since elementary school) 
led a tremendous surge by the 
Mastodons that gained them a 65-64 
lead with about 14 minutes left on the 
clock. The lead switched hands 
throughout the sixties and into the 
seventies until leading Mastodon 
scorer Rex Putt was saddled with his 
fourth foul. All four Mastodon big men 
were in foul trouble, so even though 
Keith Mendenhall, the blond bomber 
for the Mastodons, attempted to keep 
them in the game with long arching 
shots and accurate free throw 
shooting, the Spring Arbor heighth 
advantage was too much. 

All four Mastodon big men ended 
up fouling out, and the visitors 
coasled in with a victory, scoring over 
half of their final 20 points from the 
charity stripe. 

Rex Putt's 32 points was one of 
the seasonal highs in the city this 
year, while Keith Mendenhall, a 
former Woodlan High School stand- 
out, who only had a four-point 
average going into the game, netted 
20 points. Gary Trump performed 
well at his forward post with 13 points, 
and freshman standouts Dean Putt 
and Gary Daub, who led the effective 
full court man-to-man defense that 
forced Spring Arbor into numerous 
turnovers, added 10 points apiece. 

Tom Wilson led a balance scoring 
attack for the winners with 20 points. 
Rhew and Kinnear contributed 19 and 
18, while Gray, Siefert and Klinger 
scored 16, 15, and 10 respectively. 

The win brought Spring Arbor's 
record to 5-2, while the Mastodons lost 
for the eighth time in nine outings this 



boards. Gary Trump and Dean Putt 

also contributed to the brief comback 
with several steals and baskets from 
long range. 



lead^ but the inspired Mastodons 
battled back again with a pressuring 
defense and came within 7 at 80-73 and 
again at 82-75. But they got no closer 
as St. Francis began to use their big 
man effectively, and as sparkplug 
Charles King hit from outside. The 
Mastodons threatened many times 
thereafter, but each time St. Francis 
was able to regain their secure lead. 
Despite the loss, the Mastodons 
scored well; Rex Putt scored 27 and 
raised his average to 17.8, while Dave 



drives. Dean Putt added 17, and Gary 
Trump, Keith Mendenhall, and Gary 
Daub all hit double figures with 14, 14, 
and 10 points. 

St. Francis improved its record to 
3-6, while the luckless Mastodons 
dropped to 1-9. 



Mastodons score 108, lose 

St. Francis took an early first-half 
lead and then held off an Indiana- 
Purdue rally to defeat the Mastodons 
in a grueling offensive battle 120-108 
Tuesday night at the Central Catholic 
gym. It was the second battle of the 
year for these two teams, and St. 
Francis won both by the same 
margin. 

An early hot hand by big 
Troubadour Chuck James, who 
scored 25 points before fouling out 
early in the second half, helped St. 
Francis to jump into the lead by as 
much as 21 points in the first half. 
Guard Charles King and 6'8" Mike 
Jensen look hold where James left off 
as they scored 30 and 20 points 
respectively. 

St. Francis scored first on a field 
goal by James, and they never trailed 
in the game. The Mastodons got off to 
a slow start and the Troubadours 
nearly ran them out of the gym with 
amazing shooting from all over the 
floor. The Mastodons scored a 
respectable 50 first-half points, but 
their opponents had an incredible 66 
points at intermission. 

In the second half the Mastodons 
came out fighting, getting the tip and 
scoring quickly. The lead was soon 
cut down to 10 with the score 70-60. 
The rally was led by the two big men 
for the Mastodons, Dave Peterson and 
Rex Putt, Peterson scored consistent- 
ly on beautiful baseline drives, while 
Putt was strong on the offensive 

Pigskin title 
to Stonef ace 

Last Sunday Stoneface proved to 
be the toughest team as they 
embarrassed Smith 28-0 to take the 
intramural football championship for 
the second straight year. The 
relatively easy victory climaxed an 
undefeated season for Stoneface. 

On the first punt of the game, 
Steve Ottenweller twisted through the 
Smith coverage to open the scoring 
barrage. It was the first of two 
touchdowns scored by the speedy 
defensive safety. 

Stoneface's second tally, this ( 

Jon Werli

t of reach. 

Ottenweller's second score and 
another touchdown by Werli just 
added insult to injury as the Stoneface 
defense posted the shutout. John 
Jaquay and Tom Dunlap added the 
extra points to cap the scoring. 

The shutout was the first against 
Smith all season, while the 28 points 
by the Stoneface offense was twice as 
great as the previous high allowed by 
the Smith defense in a single game.

December is a special month for sports writers because it gives us a 
chance to choose our "Sportsman of the Year" for 1973. Last year it was 
Mark Spitz, and this year again the coveted award will go to an athlete 
who excelled in his-her particular sporl. 

Is it Hammerin' Hank Aaron? Not this year, Atlanta fans. Although 
Hank battled pitchers and pressure tu come within one home run of Babe 
Ruth's so far insurmountable 714, he just didn't quite make it. And that's 
what counts-tliis year. 

If it isn't Aaron, then it must be Billie Jean King, the "king" of 
women's tennis. Not only has Billie Jean dominated the women's circuit, 
but she has proved victorious in the senior men's league with her victory 
over Bobby Riggs. In the "Battle of the Sexes" King handily defeated the 
55-year-old self-proclaimed male chauvinist pig in straight sets. But the 
award winner isn't Billie Jean. 

Who else could it be, then? Why, of course, O.J. Simpson, the 
superstar of the Buffalo Bills, who will break Jimmy Brown's rushing 
record of 1863 yards this week. O.J. has really been impressive this year, 
as he will need only 61 yards to break the mark. The ex-USC star also 
broke the record for most yards compiled in a single game with about 250 
earlier in the season. But Simpson is only the runner-up this year. 

The star of pro basketball had to be Willis Reed of the Knicks. 
Although Willis wasn't the top rebounder or top scorer, it was just his 
presence which brought the NBA championship back to New York. But 
Willis isnt number one either. 

That leave only one superstar left, right? --George Foreman. 
Foreman, the 1968 Olympic boxing champion, totally demolished Joe 
Frazier in the second round to become the current heavy-weight 
champion of the world. The only problem with Foreman now is that he" 
hasn't defended his title against any "name" fighters, so that one night's 
work won't bring him the top award for 1973. 

So, my pick for the 1973 "Sportsman of the Year" award is none other 
than Bill Walton, the 6'11" center of the UCLA Bruins. Why Walton? I 
really never got to see Walton in action on a regular basis, but from what 
I saw, he was intimidating. 

There was a rumor going around that Walton was the reason UCLA 
wins all the time. Last year's undefeated season and a string of over 70 
consecutive victories might be considered excellent proof. 

The clincher concerning Walton's ability came in the championship 
game against Memphis State in late April. The Bruin guards had only to 
flip the ball anywhere within his reach and it was a sure basket. 
Defensively, Big Bill cuffed shots and rebounded so well that he was 
name college "Player of the Year" in basketball. Quite an athlete and 
quite a basketball player. 



Since this is the last issue until next semester, here a 
predictions for the Christmas break: 

Notre Dame over Alabama by 3 in the Sugar Bowl 

USC over Ohio State by 10 in the Rose Bowl 

Minnesota to take the NFC championship 

Pittsburgh to take the AFC title

In basketball. North Carolina State over UCLA by 1
