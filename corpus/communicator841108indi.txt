A committee was formed when

The committee, Harrell said, took 
applications and nominations unlil late

The committee accepted 159 ap-

advisory committees — one made up 
of IS members of the Eastern Ken- 
tucky staff and faculty, one made up of 
nine members of the student body and 
one made up of the 21 members of the 
executive council of the alumni

narrowed it down to Ihe final three 
candidates. 

The Eastern Kentucky Board of

Riders voice opinions about PTC 



By MICIIELE SHAFFER 
Chief reporter 

Beginning Nov. 1], th e Fw t Wo yn e Publi cTranspor la tl on Corpora ti on will enact 
changes in bus routes, someaflecting the PTC routes servicing IPFW. 

Several of the routes have been extended lo Include stops at shopping centers, 
while other routes will now pass by hospitals. The new schedules, including these 
stops at shopping centers are an attempt by the management of Ihe PTC lo en- 
courage new ridership Irom shoppers and employees at the shopping centers 

One of the two routes which service IPFW will begin passing Parkview 
Memorial Hospital when the changes take effect. This change's made on the Kirk- 
wood line that runs to IPFW. 

Although the changes are viewed positively, more Improvement is needed, 
according lo some student riders at IPFW. 

"They shouldn't have two (buses) coming here at the same lime." said Sharon 
Black. "They should be 15 minutes apart." Such a change, said Black, would make 
it easier lo catch transfers upon arriving downtown. The present times on the 
schedule require a person to wait even longer lo catch a transfer ride 

Another problem expressed Is the correlation between the limes buses arrive at 



IPFW. and the times class* 

"They have one (busl that's supposed to come at ll:S0," said Jean Rondel, 
"which mokes Ureal hard lo catch II you're coming from class." 

Another IPFW student, Mary R Voors said, "It's kind of a Catch-22 because 
without more people riding. Ihey can't pick up the number of routes But unless 
they pickup more routes, they wont pickup more riders." 

Theroules travelled are generally satisfactory, Voors said. 

"The routes are real good," she said, "the frequency they (ravel from point A lo 
pointBis notgood" 

Other problems expressed by student riders ore PTC presently offers no 
discount rale to students The cost for n ride Is 75 cents Reduced rates are offered, 
however, to senior citizens, handicapped individuals and children five to eleven 
years old Children under live years of age can ride free if Ihey arc accompanied 
byanadult 

Another difficulty some student riders encounter Is service to IPFW is cut off 
around 6:15 p.m. This makes it Impassible for students who a [Lend night classes to 
use the services offered by PTC. 

"For a city this sire." said Voors, "we should certainly have nighttime service." 



Transitional Studies provide services for students 



By JENNIFER ACKLEY 
Staff writer 

A student receives a fading grndeon 
the first exam of the semester The 
second exam approaches and, 
although nervous, the same sludenl 
passes with a B. 1 1 was more (han luck 
that caused the improvement 

By enlisting the aid of Ihe tran- 
sitional studies program, the student 
learned how to take notes, understand 
the text and develop more efficient 
shidy skills This self-help process 
enabled the student lo achieve a higher 
level of performance. 

Offering a variety of services to a 
variety of students, the Transitional 
Studies program has a high success 
rate The tutoring program, which 
serves about l« students this 
semester. Is available for introductory 
courses in the fields of science, foreign 
languages, English and math. The 
success rate of the program la above 

"About 63-65 percent of the students 



tutoring is available on a drop-In, 
volunlcer basis." said Michael 
O'Heor, coord ma tor of Transitional 
Studies. 
For the nan-traditional student who 



years, the Returning Adult Program 
iRAPi can provide an opportunity lo 
work on deficiencies while meeting 
others in similar situations. 

RAP consists of an orientation lo the 
university, a monthly newsletter, and 
a series of half-hour long workshops. 
These are geared to problems per- 

noles. manage time, cope with stress 
and use of the library Faculty 
members take advantage of the 
workshops to meet with the student! 
and inform them about expectations In 
their classes. 

RAP Ills about loo students per 
semester. A study, completed by 
O'Hear. on all students Involved In Ihe 
program up to the 1983-84 year, found 
that 54.9 percent of the students had 
stayed In IPFW for a minimum of two 
years, which compares favorably to 
the uni versify asa whole. 

Transitional Studies also serves 
foreign students by acting as an ad- 
vising unit until a major Held Is 
selected. But, the largest service of- 
fered by the program Is for those 
students with reading deficiencies who 
need lo develop their study ixiils 
Reading courses are scheduled to meet 
the demand of the 220 students enrolled 



this fall. This figure Is up 50 percent 

"Roughly 25 percent of these people 
areB average students, and 80 percent 
are coming out with at least a C 
average. These are positive results, 
considering thai a large number of 
these students did not have a good 
reading level when they entered." said 
O'Hear. 

With their resources presently being 
used extensively, O'Hear said that ihe 
program as a whole is not highly 
publicized. 

"Usually, in classes which tutoring 
is available, instructors are aware of 
our program and direct the students to 
our resources." It Is also ihe 
responsibility of advisors lo make 
referrals and lo let students know that

that the program exists and employ!

people. It needs lo be developed and

Outreach. The amount supplied has 
been relatively constant and has gone 
up little through the years. However,

Ashlon. "It appears that Ihe program 
is not doing less, but that interest and

Campus celebrates 20th 



Maybe a lot of people don'l Ihink it's 
such a big deal thai 20 yean ago today 
the Indiana -Purdue regional campus at 
Fort Wayne was dedicated. We think it's 
kind ol neal and a big deal should be 
made of the event. 

When 1934 first rolled around, IPFW 
gave the impression ii would celebrate 
the event. The alumni office developed a 
logo that is put on nearly every 
university publication. Intercom, IPF- 
W*s monthly public relations newsletter, 
publishes articles about the history of 
the campus Yet, IPFW bas only two 
events planned to celebrate the 20th 
birthday. 

Next month, Ihe alumni office plans a 
reunion of all the former student body 
presidents. Sometime next year, the 
Purdue-Indiana Theatre is planning an

Wayne across the alley from each other 
on Barr Street. 

In 1964, the joint campus opened up. 
The building, now known as Kelller Hall, 
was the result of hard work on the pari of 
people both inside and outside the two 
schools 

Today. IPFW occupies six major 
buildings at Its original location on 
Coliseum Boulevard. II also occupies the 



former Fort Wayne Art School on Berry 
Street and a biological research center 
at Crooked Lake near Columbia City. 
IPFW is also the sixth largest university 
in Indiana. 

In the future, IPFW will work to 
acquire a fine arts complex on campus. 
And it will work to further assist Fort 
Wayne in its economic redevelopment 

Some have suggested the ad' 

ministration, students' government and 
other organizations have chosen to 
downplay a 20th anniversary celebration 
because they don'l want lo steal the 
thunder for 1989, the 25th anniversary. 

We're not suggesting the thunder be 
stolen. We're suggesting maybe a 
campus-wide party, in which, for one 
day the entire IPFW community — 
students, alumni, staff and faculty — let 
it all hang out. 

Our campus is unique. No other 
community has ever attempted to bring 
together two "apposing" universities on 
one location. The entire world of higher 
education can look at IPFW and see, 
while there are problems concerning 
conflicting policy, that IPFW has been a
