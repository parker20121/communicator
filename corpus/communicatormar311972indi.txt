"Drag 'em off 

At 9:45 p.m., according [o State 
Police reports, a red Mach I went into a 
tkjd on an icy bridge on 1-69 near Mun- 
clc. The Mustang swerved toward the 
cement bridge, spun around, and headed 
Tor the guardrail and a 20'foot deep 
ditch at nboul 70 mph. The driver 
slammed the brakes in an attempt to 
ilow Ihe car, to prevent it from Hipping 
upon contact. After a 400 fool £iide, 
the car climbed onto Ihe guardrail and 
bounced along it for another 120 feet 
(Ihe body shop expresEcd amazement 
that the iron poslsdldn't comeup 
through the bottom of the car, killing 
both passengers). 

To Mike Pfundsteln and I, It was a bit 
mote exciting. My life didn't whiz by 
like it does in the movies. Only one 
thing was on my mind-'don't let Ihe car 
roll or you're a dead duck. That ditch 
looked like a 100 foot gorge with a rush- 
ing river filled with hungry piranhas. 

Most fatal accidenls occur? within 25 
miles of home. We were glad we were 
farther away or we'd of been dead for 

As we began out two-mile hike to the 
nearest gas sUtion, leaving Ihe car 
hanging at a 45 degree angle on the 
guardrail. Mike started grumbling that 
we went through such a spectacular 
crash and didn't have anything lo 
show [or it. No broken ribs, no nothing. 

To me that sounded like crazy talk, 
but he went on tempting me. "Just 
imagine, you could have been laid up for 
a month or so. giving you a good ex- 
cuse for not attending school. And, you 
could have gotten a lovely young Purdue 
or Parkview nurse (Is there a differenced

We waited at Ihe gas station until

us up. He could tell we were in college. 
"What's that?" "Hey look at the hand-

"Some days you eat the bear. Some days 
the bear eats you." 

Trooper J, D. and 1 discussed the 
wreck. I wasn't warned of my rights. 
He read his report. He got lo. "driving 
too fast for icy road conditions," just as 
Ihe Tooth Fairy concluded over WOWO 
"Every school should be headed by a

Then began the hour and a half wait 
for my father to arrive from Grabill. [

my car. It was a beautiful machine. Now 
it was mangled. Mike pointed out that

"You know, if I knew I wouldn't get 
hurt, t wouldn't mind doing it again." 

One wonders what God was trying 
to tell me. Was it the FIT plays or a 
devil woman? Maybe He was just 
talking to Pfundsteln. Regardless. 
it was only through His grace that we're

ple ol the Fourth District. 

Bloom told reporters, "The job of seek- 
ing out views ond opinions of the people 
Is not an easy task but one that must be 
achieved if the common sense of Indiana's 
Fourth District is to become a part of 
our Nation's Congress." 

Oloom has repeatedly told of the need 
In today's 'Big Government' for this 



"Common sense," he said, "like that 
found among the people right here that 
I'm meeting today, is what we need to 
hear from In Washington." 

In emphasizing his intentions of full 
communication with people in every walk 
of life the candidate talked about agri- 
culture today and its importance to the 
Fourth DbtricI economy. 

He aid. "A congressman must relate 
directly to problems and solutions in agri- 
culture by involving those who know their 
problems best. Ihose engaged in farming. 
I have a growing concern about the fu- 
ture of agriculture but I have discovered 
there are problems most people don't know 
exist and they won't know Ihey exist un-

The candidate concluded that the peo- 
ple are not getting this kind of true rep-

He said. "It Is necessary, not only at 
campaign time, but as an important part 
of true representation, for the congressman 
to seek out face to face solutions among

AMERICA AT WAR 1972 



A special feature 
By Scolt Gillie 

Wllh the "Issue of Vietnam 'ietumd," 
and with the trial of [he Hurlstiure 8. 
and wllh the piesldenlUI primailes In 
full swing, let ui examine once again the 
cauK of the p«ace makers. 

Although AmcTlcan troop withdrawals 
have reduced the American role In Indo- 
china ground actions, the American 
automated air war has wrought inoTede- 
UrMCtlon (caaiaiti^and refugees) during 
the Nixon administration than during 
the three years of (he Johnson regime. 
Thlsls"de-cicatation." 

In prcvioue discussions of alienation, 
alienation has been treated as the separ- 
ation of the worker or student ftom the 
whole process of work or schooling. 
Automated war is the most insane, cruel 
expression of allenalion ImBglnablc, War 
becomes Bcadumic. Feeling is totally di- 
vorced from hlliing. War rhetoric becomes 
so woll rationalized In euphemisms that 
clearing an area for niasslve bombing is 
"forced urbanisation," bombing North 



Vietnam Is referred to as "protective 
reaction," and the slaughter of human 
beings U termed "successful kill ratio." 
In automated war distance prevents hu- 
mane motives interrupting the pur- 
suit of war objectives. 

While apotoglsta of The System pro- 
claim that the protests of the sixties have 
had significant impact upon American 
foreign policy, the automated war In 
Southeast Asia continues. 

The Movement which sought to stop 
the war machine has l&gt;een. Itself, stopped 
by frustrating political realities. 

The 1972 political campaign is concen- 
trating on race issues and economic 
Issues. Everyone agrees that the dirty 
mistake In Indochina Is no longer an 
Issue. According to Department of De- 
fense figures, 3,773,336 human beings 
have been killed, wounded, or made refu- 
gees In the Indochina War since Richanl 
Nixon took of flee. This figure does not 
Include the casualties of the Viet Cong 
or the North Vietnamese combatants. 
And ycl, [he war is no longer an issue. 
Meanwhile, American planes continue 
the most protracted bombing of civilian 
areas in history.

R.D. Laing 

'The condition of alienation, of be- 
ing asleep, of being unconscious, of 
being out of one's mind. Is the condition 
of the normal man. 

Society highly values Its normal man. 
It educates children to lose themselves 
and to become absurd, and thus to be 
normal. 

Normal men have killed perhaps 
100,000,000 of their fellow men In the 
last fifty years... 

We are not able even to think adequate- 
ly about the behaviour that is at the 
annihilating edge. But what we think Is 
less than what we know; what we know 
is less than what we love: what we love 
b so much less than what there is. And 
to that precise extent we are so much 
less than what we are..." —R.D. LaIng 

George Orwell 

"...war involves very small numbers of 
people, moslily highly trained specialists. 
The fighting. ..takes place on the vague 
frontiers whose whereabouts the average 
man can only guess at.. ."--George 
Orwell, 1984. 

Col. Robert D. Heinl, jr. 

...In Vietnam. ..the best army the 
United States ever put into the field, is 
numbly extricating itself from a night-

foisted on them by bright ctviliass who

about the toUy of it all. -Col. Robert D.

'To me, in youth, science was more 
important than either man or God. Like 
most of modern youth, I worshipped

Theodore Roszak 

" ... a vocabulary filled with nebulous 
quantities of things that have every 
appearance of predse calibration, and 
decorated with vaguely mechanistic- mathe- 
matical terms like "parameters," "struc- 
tures," "variables," "inputi and outputs," 
"correlations," "inventories," "maximi- 
zations," and "optimizations." The 
terminology derives from Involuted Stt- 
tistical procedures and methodological 
mysteries to which only graduate edu- 
cation gives access. The more such langl^ 
age and numerology one packs Into a 
document, the mote "objective" the 
document becomes-whlch normally means 
the less morally abrasive to the sources 
that have subsidized the research or to 
any sources that might conceivably sub- 
ddlzc one's research at any time In the 
future. The vocabulary and the methodo- 
logy mask the root ethical assumptions of 
policy or neatly transcribe them into a 
depersonalized rhetoric which provides a 
gto^ of military or political necessity. To 
think ond to talk in such terms becomes 
the sure sign of being a certified realist, a 
"hard research" man. 

Thus to bomb more hell out of a tiny 
Asian country in one year than was bomb- 
ed out of Europe In the whole Second 
World War becomes "escalation." Threat- 
ening to burn and blast to death several 
million dvUlans in an enemy country Is 
called "deterrence." Turning a dty Into 
radioactive rubble is called "taking out" 
a city. A concentration camp (already a 
euphemism for a political prison) becomes 
a "stral^ic hamlet," A comparison of 
the slaughter on both sides in a war la 
called a "kill ratio." Totaling up the 
corpses is called a "body count," Ruimlng 
the blacks out of town is called "urban 
renewal." Discovering ingenious new 
ways to bilk the public is called "market 
research." Outflanking the discontent of 
employees iscaUed "personnel manage- 
ment." Wherever possible, hldeousreall- 
ties ate referred toby cryptic initials and 
rormuUhke phrases: ICBM. CBR, maga- 
deaths, or "operation" this, "operation" 
that. -Theodore Roszak

POLITICAL AWARENESS WEEK

John Roche 
9:00 



John P. Roche, whose column or 
commentary on current cvcnlsand 
politics, titled. "A Word Edgewise,.." is - 
Internationally distributed by King Fea- 
tures Syndicate, has an impressive repu- 
tation as one ot this country's most dls- 
tlnguliticd liberal historians and writers 
on political science. 

Professor Roche resigned September 9, 
I96S from the White House staff after 
two years as Special ConauJLant to Presl' 
dent Lyndon B. John.win, for whom he 
monitored various foreign ond domestic 
problems, notably Vietnam and the Mid' 
die East. At that lime, the 4&amp;'ycar-old, 
Brooklyn -born writer announced that, in 
addition to undertaking the thrice weekly 
column, he would return to the faculty 
of Brandeis University, from which he 
had been on leave of absence. 

Dr. Roche is a former naltonai Choir- 
mon of Americans for Democratic Action 
(l962to 1965) and the author of more 
than B dozen books on political thought, 
government and history. He has been, at 
various times. Consultant to the U.S. 
Stale Department, the Vice-President, and 
the Civil Rights Oimmission. 

From 1949 to 1956 Roche was an 
associate professor of political science 
at Kaverford College, Pennsylvania. He 
was appointed Chairman of the Politics 
Department at Brandeis University in 
1956 and Dean of Faculty in 1958. He 
resigned as Dean of Faculty in I960 to 
return as Chairman of the Polities 
Department. 

Now he has returned to tli^- Massaehu-- 
sett5 campus as Professor of Polities and 
History, holding the Morris HlUquit 
Chair to which he was named as the first 
occupant in 1957. 

Roche, who has an A.B. from Hofstra 
College and his M.A. and Ph.D. from 
Cornell University, has been a visiting 
professor at Swaithmore College, Massa- 
chuselU Institute of Technology, Cornell 
University, Columbia University and the 
University of Chicago, as well as teaching 
overseas at the Salzburg Seminar in Am- 
erican Studies and at the University of Aix 
en Provenct (Nice Seminars) in France as 
a Kulbrlght professor. 

He also has been a member of the 
Executive Council of the American Poli- 
tical Science Association, and a Fellow 
of both the Fund for the Advancement of 
Education and the Rockefeller Founda- 
tion 

Roche's writing style Is marked by 
incisive wit, pungency, and c love of com- 
bat. One reviewer remarked, "Roche has 
an unsurpased instinct for the jugular." 
His study of American civil liberties, 
•The Quest For the Dream" (Macmiltan) 
claimed national attention In hard cover 
and In 1968 was issued as a paperback 
(QuadtTingle Books). "Shadow and Sub- 
stance" was on outstanding collection of 
his essays on the theory and structure of 
politics; and his "Courts and Rights" 
(Random House), dealing with the Am- 
erican Judiciary In action, has been 
called a "classic" in Its Tield. 

In addition. Dr. Roche has written more 
than one hundred articles and reviews 
In scholarly and popular journals, In- 
cludlrtg leading law reviews and "The In- 
ternational Encyclopedia of Social Sd-

that Buckley surely knows who David 
Frye is; so do Lyndon B. Johnson and 
President Richard Nixon. To some Am- 
erican TV watchers. David Frye Is Wil- 
liam F. Buckley, just as he often Is 
Johnson, Nixon, and all of the other famous 
peisonalilles, political and otherwise, he 
is known to imper»&gt;nate. This has all come 
about In the last couple of years. 

Today, the name David Frye is synono- 
mous with political caricature and mimi- 
cry. Helsoneof Ihemost In-demand 
comedians in the nation and there is 
hardly a video variety show or late night 
panel program that has not had him as a 
guest. His fame further Increased recently 
with the release of Elelttra Records' 
"I am the President," an album contain- 
ing original sketches of Frye performing 




OS the President. Vice President (Agnew), 
Humphrey, Johnson. David Sussklnd, 
Henry Fonda, and others. 

All of this Impact on American cul- 
ture and comedy came about because 
young David was absolutely convinced he 
could not follow In his father's fooUleps 
asa businessman. Brooklyn born New 
York bred, David's Hrsl try wos Edward 
G, Robinson for friends while at James 
Madison High School, Like most mimics 
he went on to the "trndltlonal stars: 
Cagney, Lionel Uarrymore, etc." 

Collegelife wos hardly different. He 
studied hard, but wound up doing Im- 
pressions every weekend, leaving little 
time to devote to being Dovid. Never- 
theless, he graduated. Later, he entered 
the Army. After dlschorgc he landed a 
job Bsa salesman for the Anchor Office 
Cleaning Company In Manhallan...a firm 
that happened to be owned by his father. 
Despite the fact that he was sober, dili- 
gent and honest, he was fired... seems 
every time he answered the phone his 
voice was disguised as Humphrey Go- 
garl, 3 sound that often threw unaware 
customers way off balance. 

Now unemployed, he began haunting 
the Greenwich Village Coffee Houses and 
ere long developed a following: as well 
asa broadly based act specializing In 
political figures. 

"My first political impersonallon was 
of a now forgotten conservative named 
Godfrey P. Schmidt. I was just a kid, but 
something about his style prodded me in- 
to developing a characterization," says 
Frye. "I didn't do another one for years 
until the Kennedys came along. From 
there on I seemed to just fall into one 
afteranother." 

Since then he has become so well- 
known asa comedian, political satirist 
and mimic, that he has almost replaced 
the actual personolltics of the men he 
mimes in the public's mind. No one 
can remember whether Richard Nixon 
ever actually said "and now let me make 
one thii^ perfectly clear." But they 
know David Frye does say them. 

Just as Gary Grant never said "Judy, 
Judy, Judy" in any film, he'll be remem- 
bered for those words in years to come. 
And Richard Nixon may forever find 
bimseir asociated with David Frye (or 
words he never actually uttered. 

The fact that it is happening at all is 
a tribute to David's talent; for as long as 
there are politicians and personalities 
making news, there will be a David Frye 
standing by to satirize them. 

When this nation stops laughing at it- 
self it won't need any more David Frye*. 
There just won't be anylhiif aiound to 
laughtaL

fuls as (hey prepare for the opener just 
eight days away. This year's squad will 
be trying to lop last year's 14-6 log 
which was by far the best record of all 
the city college learns. That might be a 
tough trick Eo pull, but Athletic Director 
Jim Bollinger is conHdent that this 
year's team can and will get the job done. 

Hal Prickett will be reluming for his 
second year as head coach with Dave 
Hey scrvingashisasslstanl. Prickett 
Is a high school teacher al West Noble 
while Hey teaches physical education at 
Gtenwixid Park elementary. Hey hurled 
Tor Ande(v&gt;n College under former 
major league pitching star Carl Erskine 
and thus handling the pitchers will be 
his main task. 

The pitchers and catchers have been 
working out ror nearly a month at the 
Central gym and were joined by Ihe 
reslof the squad Match 20. Running, 
throwing, and calisthenics have been 
stressed thus far, wilh the team hoping lo 
begin practice oulslde next Wednesday. 

One bright spot already is the return 
of the entire varsity infield led by the 
team's leading '71 hitler, shortstop 
Frank Franks. The outHeld Is not yet 
sel-nelther is the pitching. The main 
weak point for the coaches to deal wilh 
In the pitching situation appears lo be 
the lack or a southpaw.

manager and /or slots man. Bollinger 
points out that this job includes cligt. 
bility for a teller and free travel. Anyone 
interested in this post Is urged lo get in

port of the second half . He didn't re- 
ceive much help from his teammates and 
the Barnstormers countered with a bal- 
anced scoring attack. Beard and Brown 
topped the winners with 16 and 13 points, 
respectively. 

In Tuesday's action. Sauers downed the 
Dudes. 49-47. and the Posse edged 
Brock's Jocks. 63-60. Sauers played 
again In the third game, and bowed to 
the Barnstormers, 58-46. 

The Barnstormers jumped oul to a 12- 
lead, and kept their margin at that for 
rnosl of the contest. The Award for 
Poor Losers of the Year goes to Sauer's 
team for (heir actions during this game.

buildings will be closed and locked dur- 
ing this period. Ifany plants, aninals. 
or other items need special consideration 
during this utility outage, plan ahead. 



Student group travel... 
safe or risky adventure? 



b&gt; Dennis J. Sosinslu 

sometime during the summer months, 
I'll wager thai you'll see a picture of for- 
lorn American students sitting or lying on 
the floor of a major airport in the U.S. or 
Europe. This picture will be followed up 
by an article which wilt b.&lt; headlineC 
"Student Group Stranded as Charter 
Flight Cancelled" or "Would-be Vaca- 
tioners Stalled by Illegal Flight." 

Being basically a commuting campus. 
studenU here at lU-PU Fort Wayne don't 
have the opportunity to be heavily ex- 
posed to student group charter flights. 
On both the main campuses of lU and 
Pit, the existence of these flights are num- 
erous and varied. One can spend any of 
his or her vacations in Mexico, the Baha- 
mas, Jamaica, San Juan or anywhere else 
in the Carribean. 

Longer vacations are spent in England, 
Europe. South America, etc. at really un- 
believably low cosls. Actually, where- 
evcT one wishes to go, there's bound lo 
be a student group charter flight organized 
Right there is where the problems are most 
likely to exist. 

I'll bet also that this summer yoult 
hear of a news story telling of thousands 
of Americans (students in particular) who 
signed up for cut-rate charter fiights, paid 
in full, arrived at the ah-port only to find 
that: 1.) NO seats were availnble for them 
on the night Ihey expected lo board; 2.) 
The night hasbeen cancelled; 3.) Thenight 
has been cancelled for a week; or 4.) The 
travel agent who had arranged the lour had 
gone bankrupt or absconded and the whole 



Irip^ 



is off. 



Two summers ago. Worid Academy, a 
foreign study^roup organizer bases in 
Cinc\nnati, went bankrupt, and stranded 
more than 3,000 students who had already 
been nown to Europe and abruptly can- , 
celled the lours of another 1,800 to 2,000 
who had paid in Full for their trips and 
were waiting to depart to Europe. This 
was only one charter lour operator that 
failed, in a maze of many which are suc- 
cessful in providing proper transportation 
and tour operations. 

In 1971 alone, belter than 3,800,000 Hew 
overseas, primarily lo Europe. This was at 
an estimate of $3,800 million spent-dose 
to au all time high. Ot this. 1,100,000 or 
nearly one out of four Hew by charter 
plane and spent approximately $700 mll- 
llun. These figures should definitely hit an 
all time high again this year. 
These figures were reached because of 
three main reasons: 1.) 50% on an air- 
line ticket alone could be saved by going 
on a charter flight-thus trips never thought 
possible before could be taken: 2.) Most 
charter nights are safe, well managed and 
compare quite favorable with regular 
scheduled airiine nights; and 3.) Most 
tour operators are honest, responsible and 
well informed about the travel they rccom- 
ment, Bui "traveling abroad" can be 
accomplished in a wide range of prices. 



brands, grades, quality, types and suann- 

Individual fares ate available on the 
scheduled airlines, which offer you the 
greatest flexibility in schedule, with the 
highest guarantee of service and rcsDon- 
sibllity. Pitfall-ah. yes. the very top of 
the price range. Package lours, excur- 
sion, and group fores are offered on the 
scheduled airlines and gives you the bene- 
fits of above for a lesser price-bul these 
are only offered al various limes-afler the 
peak season is over. 

Finally there are the charters which 
can be bought from many sources and in 
a variety of forms Some charters include 
transportation only, while others Include 
ground accomodations Some charters 
ore HowS^y the scheduled airlines 
(T.W.A-. United, etc.), some by larger 
American nonschedulcd (charkr only) 
airiines. And some by a mixture of 
European companies of different degrees 
of reputation and performance. 

The charters are by far the chcapest- 
and ihls, of course, is Iheir main attrac- 
tion. Next week 111 discuss whal you 
should look for In chatters lo avoid the 
pitfalls and get the most out for the 
least amount and slill be assured of 
going.
