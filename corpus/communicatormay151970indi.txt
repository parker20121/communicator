erica was or ganize d 
Monday on the Regional 
Campus as an outgrowth 
of the April 22 Earth

The second annual Geneva, ^Switaerlan 



The second annual 
fencing match was held

in the event were Doug 
Opdyke, first; Eric An- 
derson, second; and

holds a degree as a 
fencing master given 
to him four years ago 
by the International 
Fencing Association in 



Geneva, "Switzerland, 
This degree has two re- 
quirements after it is 
earned: 1) that the 
instructor promote fen-

who studied fencing at 
the Fencing Academy in 
Stuttgart, Germany has

September, 1969 , —The IU-PU COMMUNICATOR is 
named the official newspaper of t he Fort Wayne 
Regional Campus. 

Mav 16. ^.970 — Volume I of the IU-PU COMMUNI- 
CATOR is completed. 

And so one whole school year has passed (or 
maybe flown would be a better word). Now it's 
time for me to thank the staff who went through 
so much, the various printers who put up with our 
changing deadlines, the old Student Government 
who kept us on our toes, the new Student Govern- 
ment who wants to help, all the secretaries and 
information people who found answers to all our 
questions, the faculty and administration who 
offered advice and ajhelping hand, and to all the 
students who gave us their support and construc- 
tive criticism. 

Now is the time... and an editorial that has 
been planned since March is long in materializing* 
How can I say thank you in a special way — a way 
that hasn't been uttered since the time of Adam 
and Eve? 

I can't. 

Thank you from the bottom of my he art o

I thought some of us 
in college were out to 
better society (each in 
his own way.) We say 
that we are fed up with 
our government and poli- 
tics. Fine — nice words. 

But, dammit the PSA 
party, like any political 
party worth its salt, 
soon turns around and 
screws the people. 

In the April ?i| issue 
of the COMMUNICATOR, the 
PSA platform included 
"WE PLEDGE NOT TO ALLY 
OURSELVES WITH ANY OR- 
GANIZATION, PERSON , ~0R 
OFFICE OUTSIDE OF THIS 
CAMPUS . " 

This is a simple 
violation of one of the 
principles of the PSA's 
platform, (at least true 
politicians do it by 
covert and devious 
methods . ) 

This shows how "hu- 
man" the PSA senate is r 
They still use the "sys- 
tem" which some of us 
want thrown out— of not 
speaking an d consulting 
the studentsT (sounds 
familiar) 

So will the PSA se- 
nate please explain the 
course of action they 
followed regarding Kent 
State?

Dear Editor, 

I consider myself 
one of the "silent ma- 
jority"; however, I 
found that I'm not as 
silent as I thought. 
Witness the student 
body elections In which 
of some 7,ooo students 
only 8^1 voted. This 
means that only 12.1% 
of the students of this 
univeristy voted. 

Many students wonder 
why the administration 
will not listen to the 
student government on 
paid parking, tuition 
fees and other matters. 
Well, maybe it is be- 
cause the administra- 
tion doesn't think that 
a student government 
elected by only 7 »1% 
( the PSA had only 51+0 
of the 851 votes) 
doesn 't really speak 
for the "silent major- 
ity.

To the SDSers and 
Leftist Radicals in the 
Student's Government In 
c/o IU-PU COMMUNICATOR: 

Your attempts to 
subvert some of the 
striking workers of 
this great city x and 
hence, attempt to gain 
a city-wide worker's 
strike will be to no a- 
vail. The workers of 
this great city will 
never allow themselves 
to be degraded by your 
presence or influence. 

To the Students' 
Government: 

1. Where are those 
jobs you promised all 
of us students? (St* 
dents: Thank Mr.Chavis 



for getting you a job, 
not Scott Gilliel ) 

2. Have you stopped 
PAID PARKING yet? 

3. Have you lowered 
the activities fee yet? 

_ Maurice A. Emery 



The People's Student 
Alliance has pledged to 
use their minds, their 
strength, and their po- 
wer to aid the students 
of this campus. Where 
are the new ideas to 
lower the activities 
fee? Where are the 
creative plans to eli- 
minate paid parking? 
Where are the students? 

The PSA party has 
been caught up In a 
national, save the 
world, whirlpool. They 
are transporting in no» 
student organizational 
supporters off the 
streets of Fort Wayne 
to carry out PSA poli- 
cies. They are seeking 
advice from dissenting 
Notre Dame students. 
They are dividing the 
students of our campus. 
I consider it a gross 
injustice to the stu- 
dents of this universi- 
ty that the PSA party 
sees fit to shun the 
intelligence of the In- 
diana-Purdue students, 
but to seek advice from 
such reputable sources. 

Even the imaginative 
leader of the PSA busies 
himself back-slapping 
party members for apply- 
ing the finishing 
touches on the jobs on 
campus policy and the 
teacher evaluation 
study. But, the only 
creative thought he has 
so far devised is to 
change the wording of 



teacher evaluation to 
read teacher elevation. 
I sincerely hope in 
the future that the PSA 
will try to develop 
their own creative 
thinking and work only 
for the students on this 
campus .

H ITLER- 
ANTI-WAR 



by Joseph Alsop 

WASHINGTON --IN 1933: 
With Adolf Hitler al- 
ready in power in Ger- 
many, a substantial 
majority of the members 
of Oxford tfion voted that 
they would never "bear 
arms for King or coun- 
try." 

This Oxford oath, as 
it was called in the 
time, must be wholly 
unknown to the young 
anti-war demonstrators, 
since they are also 
anti-history. l ^ut Lhey 
will do well to nonder 
it all the same. 

The vote of the Ox- 
ford Union undoubtedly 
reflected the views 
then held by most Bri- 
tish undergraduates. 
For that very nason, 
and also because it had 
a certsin dramatic suc- 
cinctness, it made alot 
of noise in the world. 

Amoni' those who re- 
member the Oxford Oath 
today, t h e ci 1 s t oms r j 
thing to say i3 that 
the very same under- 
graduates who swore 
they would never bear 
arms in Britain's de- 
fense, then went out 
and fought like hell in 
Hitler's war. This is 
2 cont. on pg. i| 



IU-PTT COMMUNICATOP 



cont. from pg. 3 
true, in the main, but 
it is also completely 
unimportant. 

It is most important, 
however, that the Ox- 
ford Oath made a tre- 
mendous impression uoon 
Hitler himself, as the 
archives reveal. In 
fact, Hitler customar- 
ily cited the Oath, . 
whenever the German 
General Staff warned 
him of the risks of his 
next move forward. It 
was proof, Hitler said, 
that Britain was rotten 
to the core, which 
meant that the risks 
were being exaggerated 
by the general staff. 

In this manner, in 
fact, the Oxford Oath 
even played a certain 
role in the bringing of 
World War II . Even more 
important, it was slso' 
a mere reflection of 
the condition of moral 
and material disarma- 
ment into which Britain 
had fallen at the time.* 

It revealed the cli- 
mate that left Britain 
almost unarmed, while 
Hitler built up Ger- 
many's armed might at a 
furious rate. It fore- 
cast the impotence of ( 
Britain's response to 
the imvasion of the 
Rhineland, when Hitler^ 
rule would have ended 
if the British gover- 
nment had been vigorous 
and firm. 

In sum, the Oxford 
Oath, the climate that J 
produced it, and the 
results of that climate 
also produced, add up 
to a grim textbook case 
for today's young de- 
monstrators to study. 
If they study the case 
carefully, they will 



learn exactly how to 
blunder into a Third 
World War by being 
anti-war. And that is 
precisely where we are 
tending. 

It is just this as-, 
pect of the American 
situation that most 
disturbs a traveler, 
like this reporter, who 
has just returned from 
an intensive inspectim 
of two wars, in Vietnam 
and in Israel. The war 
in Vietnam is going 
very well, indeed, as 
President Nixon quite 
truthfully informed the 
nation. 

It will go even bet- 
ter if the president 
wirts his Cambodian gam- 
ble. Without Cambodian 
supplies and Cambodian 
bases, in fact, Hanoi 
must eventually abandon 
the war altogether in 

the richest and meet im- 
portant part of South 
Vietnam, the two big 
southern corps areas. 
And if this happens, 
American lives will in- 
deed be saved, just as 
the President said. 

But in the middle 
East, it is very dif- 
ferent indeed. Here the 
Russians have now taken 
over Egypt's air de- 
fense, pretty near, 
lock, stock, and barrel. 
They have thereby 
placed the hate-swollen 
Ehyptians in a position 
to wear down Israel by 
slow stages, until Is- 
rael is destroyed. And 
let no one deceive him- 
self: Israel's total 
destruction is Gamal 
Abdel Nasser's real aim. 

It remains to be 
seen what the Israels 
will do p'oout this. 
Since they are too few 
to fight a purely de- 
fensive war, whatever 



they do must involve 
really desperate risks. 
There is something else 
however, that most em- 
phatically does not 
remain to be seen. The 
new Soviet step in the 
Middle East implies a 
dramatic change of 
course, toward a much 
bolder, more aggressive 
national policy. 

It can be said on 
highest, authority that 
this .ominous Soviet 
change,, of course, was 
very much present in 
the President's m'nd, 
when he made his Cambo- 
dian decision. Looking 
at the toughness of the! 
President that he show- 
ed in this action, the 
Kremlin leaders must 
naturally recalculate 
their risks all over 
the world. 

But it is now a con- 
test between the Pres- 
ident and the anti-war. 

demonstrators. Let us 
suppose the demonstra- 
tors win, by senatorial 
fat-headedness or In 
some other way . The 
United States will then 
sink into the condition 
of moral and military 
disarmament which these 
young people have been 
taught to regard as the 
national ideal. 

Israel's destruction 
will be among the first 
consequences; In fact, 
the demonstrators and 
their older inspirers 
will be Nasser's part- 
ners in the murder of 
Israel. One could go 
further with the les- 
sons of the Oxford Oath, 
but this s hould be suf- 
ficient.

TASTE OF BREAD &amp; BUTTER 



The PSA was not elected on a platform of screa- 
ming Leftism. We were elected on a platform of 
cold bread and butter issues — economic issues: 
more jobs, lowering the activity fee, halting 
Paid Parking, adding studying areas. 

We will not use the offices of Student Govern- 
ment as the spring board for advancing political 
ends. I feel that his type of orientation led 
the previous administration into a split in the 
Student Assembly which divided the Student Gov- 
ernme nt alo ng the_ lines of - the U. N*

The question of the

who cares about a well-

*Is this school's extra 
curricular activities 
adequate for the stu- 
dents?" 

Dennis Ambriole -I feel 
that they lacked quite 
a lot. They should be 
made up by what the 
students enjoy. The 
money that we give in 
activities fees should 

be used more for what 
the students want. 
Doug Schrock -The stu- 
dents in many cases are 
unaware of extra-curri- 
cular programs and ac- 
t*"*ties. Mar I udents 
do not even jmowbt&amp;fere 



is a newspaper at this 
campus. The extra-cur- 
ricular activities are 
adequate, but student 
participation is inade- 
quate. Sports could be 
dropped as far as I am 
concerned and other 
progjraras which have a 
small number of parti- 
cipants. Other a ctivi- 
ties should remain or be 
expanded depending upon 
the number of people 
involved or the number 
attending such activi- 
ties. Extra-curricular 
a cjg.yji t ie s ar e adeq uate 
and in some cases over- 
adequate and are a 
waste of time and money 
for the students. 
Sue Kaufman -No. So far

Pam Durbin- No. The ex- 
TTra- curricula^ activit- 
ies .tQjt wepg. offered 
were Aot even known by 
most of the students. 
Miw&gt; Manes - Yes, for the 
"gnys, but no, for the 
girls. There are plen- 
ty of things for the 
guys to get into like 
soccer, basketball, 
baseball, etc. but I 
will say that the girls 
have no extra curricu- 
lar activities connect* 
ed with the school. 
Don Predricks - Not 
really! 

Gary Sprunger -No, be- 
cause I'm not interested 
inthe extra - curricular 
activities this campus 
offers.

Here's What ... 

cont. from n&amp; f, 
Mike Clay -I feel the 
In Samurai and ' e xt rauiu- 
ral programs at I.U.-- 
P.U. are well organized 
and lack adequate sup- 
ervision and promotion, 

O txe Booker - 

There are many advan- 
tages in participating 
in extra-curricular ac- 
tivities. You could ask 
the Univeristy Singers, 
why do you enjoy meeting 
people, going places, 
performing for different 
audienced? You could 
ask the University Swing- 
ers, did you enjoy tra- 
veling out of the Uni- 
ted States to those un- 
civilized countriesTHal 
You could ask a member 
of the debate team or 
speech team, why do you 
enjoy going to different 
campuses in Michigan, 
•Ohio, Indiana, and 
Pennsylvania? You mean, 
you like to meet people 
with different ideas, 
people that are unfcra- 
liberal? You mean you 
would rather discuss 
things, than to be a 
member of the silent 
majority? (Nutsl) I'm 
sure that math clubs, 
drama, discussion 
, groups, the newspaper 
and student government 
have, a lot to offer gcs. 
I feel that extra 
curricular activities 
on campus are adequate 
for the students. I 
also feel that there 
are many reasons the 
■students don't partici- 
pate in the available 
activities. First _ of 
all the campus has a 
"Walk on," "Walk off" 
atmosphere, mostly be- 
cause of the size and 
'facilities. While the 
campus is expanding in 



size, the students are 
not expanding ideas for 
the future . Secondly, 
a number of students 
work and go to school 
and they don't have 

time for otner activi- 
ties. Thirdly, a num- 
ber of students are not 
informed about what is 
offered. 

The students that 
are informed sometimes 
do not like the work 
that is involved, or 1 
they are not familiar 
with the activity. A 
number of us do not 
like to try anything 
different, or look into 
other things with open 
minds. On the contrary, 

when the majority of 
students are doing 
something that we don't 
really know about, the 
rest tend to follow. 
We'll boycott classes 
or really get concerned 
about pollution. But 
this enthusiasm lasts 
only a short time. 

Some of us are very 
narrow minded, hung up 
on ourselves, preju- 
diced and ultra-con- 
servative; this could 
be due to the environ- 
ment of many people in 
Port Wayne and the 
United States as a 
whole •

personal interview 
by Sandy Bradway 

Steppenwolf -- live 
and joining them....... 

in concert, . .Atlantis . , 

On Friday, May 8, 
the Steppenwolf -Atlan- 
tis concert stertedwith 
Atlantis. Among the 
songs Atlantis played 
were "Nothing Easy" and 
'Ode to an Albatross," 
Atlantis does all of 
their own arrangements. 
They have a new one, 
"Memories of Kent 
State," that may be re- 
leased as a J+5. 

Steppenwolf came on 
in an aura of oran ,- e 
violet and blue spot- 
lights. They played a 
number of songs from 
their Monster album, 
and ended with "Pusher 
Man." and "Born to be 
Wild." They also dedi- 
cated a song to the 
four students killed at 
Kent State. 

In an interview af- 
ter the concert, they 
had this to say about 
the demonstrations and 
Kent State, They agree 
with the demonstrations, 
but say the violence is 
regrettable. They said 
that America's young 
people have become its 




conscience anu the 
young are trying to 
preserve the country as 
it should be. 

Stenpenwol r got to- 
gether In September of 
1968 and got their name 
from the book 5 teppen - 
w olf . All their sonars 
"Have been original with 
the exception of four 
songs from their first 
album. 

They have been to 
Europe twice, and other 

than tours such as 
these, they just give 
concerts on the week- 
ends . 

They said besides 
their music, they all 
have private homes and 
lives to look after. 

When asked how they 
felt about some of their 
songs being used in 
"Easy Rider," they com- 
mented. Peter Fonda 
picked all the songs 
that were used in the 
show himself. It was 
the best score done and 
a fine show. 

They said that per- 
forming their songs and 
making records would do 
for awhile, but that 
someday they may quit 
performing and go into 
other things.
