Dickens Dinner open to students 

The Dickens Dinner, coming up on December 1st. 
2nd, 3rd and 4th. is the largest annual event sponsored 
by the IPFW Music Department. 

Special arrangements have been made by the 
department to include students this year. The new 
arrangement is that students may attend the program 
on any of the four days, pay one dollar, receive coffee 
and doughnuts, and benefit from the programs. 
Students also have the option of paying 55-25. thereby
