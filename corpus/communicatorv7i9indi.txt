EDITORIAL 

Parking plan good 

Students" Government has endorsed a parking proposal -engineered by several 
student JPAC members-thai has some very good and interesting points. 

First of all the measure finally puts the financial burden OD the proper pari lea 
it to afford parking close to the buildings. Students and 
staff that don't want to put out the money can take their chances in finding a space, 
what many are paying $6.00 a year for now. 

Individuals who don't have long classes hut still need rd.ilivHy H..m- ii.trkini: 
can park at the meters This could benefit working students and part-time 
members tremendously. 

e proposal also calls for study to invest n:;&lt;l ■■ ll»- 1*^1 In lilies for DGTS and 
IPFW parking stickers to be mutually acceptable The two campuses are in the 
process of merging operations and such a mutual acceptance will only help speed 
up this process. , 

1 t thing about the parking plan is that il .■limiimfcs Ihe faculty elite

Mike Folk and his study group have done an admirable job in drawing up this 
parking proposal. The reaction of the university administration will be another 




60% of BOSE Owners 
Changed Our Mind 



While we enjoy talking about the technology that 
distinguishes the BOSE 901, and about the 
unprecedented series of rave reviews by leading 
critics, the purpose of an advertisement is to 
increase sales by introducing more people to the 
product. 

A surprising result of a customer survey changed 
our mind as to the most effective use of 
advertising funds. It revealed that 60 percent of 
the people who select the BOSE 901 do so at the 
recommendation of a 901 owner! This told us that 
the best advertisement is the product, and the 
best salesman is the enthusiastic owner. 



We concluded that an excellent use of advertising 
funds would be to help set up an absolutely 
phenomenal music system in as many owners' 
homes as possible. Known as the SUPER BOSE 
SYSTEM, it consists of the 1801 power amplifier 
and two pairs of 901 speakers. One pair of 901s is 
placed to reflect sound off a front wall, and the 
second pair reflects off side walls, producing 
sound with spatial realism and presence that is 
simply astounding. 




_JB£JSk 



program in setting up these systems in 
ts' homes is to provide the SECOND PAIR 
OF 901s FREE to all those serious enough tol 
purchase a component system consisting of the| 
1801 amplifier and a pair of 901s. We havs 
allocated sufficient advertising funds to cover all 
purchases made from October 15, 1975 to January 
15, 1976. 

We believe that the SUPER BOSE SYSTEM is 
the best music system available today. 




And we believe that its owners i 
BOSE salesmen tomorrow.
