Aid targeted for 'the neediest' 



ByJOHNMcGAULEY 

Chief Reporter 

Concerns continue in IPFW's 
Financial Aid Office (or the fate of 
those who are being affected by new 
federal regulations restricting granls 
for higher education. 

These new restrictions, geared 
toward reducing the federal deficit, 
have resulted in financial aid being 
targeted lo what Director of Scholar- 
ships and Financial Aid Richard 
Bellows feels are '"the neediest of the 

As reported in The Communicator, 
December 11, a redefinition of "in- 
dependent" student status may 
eliminate upwards of sbcty percent of 
those receiving higher education 
granls. However, according to Bellows, 
another change, involving the 
Guaranteed Student Loan program, 
may prove more critical than the 
charge in independent student status. 

In the past, those sbidents applying

education 

Director of The Office of Minority 
Affairs, Bettye Poignard, has an- 
nounced Ihe launching of a program 
geared for middle school students 
called ■■Mastering the Possibilities." 

The objectives of the program are to 
reach minority students 'early with 
information concerning the values of 
higher education, the importance of 
goal selling, planning a course of study 
which will prepare students to make 
appropriate career decisions, 
researching career opportunities, and 
maximizing and mastering the 
possibilities at Indiana-Purdue Fort 
Wayne, 

Sludents from the Black Collegian 
Caucus visit middle schools in the area, 
utilizing Afro-American clubs at their 
entre. Poignard indicated that 
■'students are your be^i ambassadors." 
■'They are in a position to relate to other 
students, and lo handle questions that 
students would not pose to adults." 
Sludents from the Black Collegian are 
directly involved in the program, 
talking to students in groups and one-to- 

Blackhawk Middle School was used 
as Lhe pilot school, and the program 
was well received. 

In a personal letter to each student, 
Poignard said, '"We want your middle 
school years to be exciting, lull of fun, 
sports, dances, concerts — We also 
want you to explore future career 



for the Guaranteed Student Loan 
program (GSL) have only had to 
participate in a simple test involving 
looking up on a reference table exactly 
how much of a loan the siudeni was 
eligible for. Starting this year, sludents 
applying for any available aid 
programs, including the GSL must file 
the Financial Aid Form (FAF). 
Bellows called this piece of documen- 
tation ■■[oreign^^ to upwards of thirty- 
five percent of those fihng only for the 
GSL- He also revealed the residts of 
recent simulations conducted by In- 
diana University which predict that 
some forty to forty-five percent of those 
applying for the GSL will be affected by 
these new restrictions, some loans 
being reduced by twenty-five percent or 
more. According lo the 1,U 
simulations, fifteen to twenty percent of 
Indiana students filing for lhe GSL 
would not be eligible al all. 

Due lo the six to eight weeks required 
for processing the new Financial Aid 



Forms, Bellows stressed that the FAF 
must be filed with the Financial Aid 
Office as quickly as possible. Those 
waiting until late to file the FAF will 
probably run into trouble getting Ihe 
results back by the beginning of the 
next school year Bellows speculated 
that anyone filing after June 1 will have 
problems, 

A number of sludents have already 
started the process of applying for aid 
and have found out that they are likely 
no longer eligible for aid. Bellows said 
that these students "are not happy and 
we are not happy to have to lell them 
(that they are no longer eligible for 
aid) '■ The Financial Aid office does 
work with the student lo find other 
methods of aid. However, Bellows said 
that it is "pretty lough lo come up with 
other alternatives." 

Among the other ways of obtaining 
aid for higher education are the PLUS 
loan program, which is guaranteed liv 
the federal government Only lhe in- 



terest on the loan is payed while the 
siudeni is still in school. The Fori 
Wayne Education Foundation does 
offer some form of scholarships or 
grants, but officials of the foundation 
could not be reached for further deUils, 

Bellows said that only under ex- 
tenuating circumstances would any 
appeals be considered, and then only 
challenges lo judgements on the 
student's independent status would be 
considered. These must \x written 
appeals and filed with the Financial Aid 
Office. 

Chancellor Thomas Wallace sUled 
Ihal he is ■■interested in pursuing 
financial aid tor part lime students." 
Being considered in conjunction wilh 
the continuing evaluation of IPFW, tiiis 
aid would be supported by the state. 
Currently, a number of stales, with the 
notable exception of Indiana, do offer 
some financial aid to part lime 
students.

Franklin named to Leadership Fort Wayne 



ByJOHNMcGAULEY 
Chief Reporter 

The Fort Wayne Corporate Council 
has announced its fifth "Leadership 
Fort Wayne" program and class 
members. 

Elizabeth Frankliln, director of 
community relations and assistant to 
the Chancellor, was selected last month 
to participate in the year long program. 

According lo Franklin the main 
thrust of the class is aimed toward 
familiarizing people, in positions of 
community leadership or who show 
potential for attaining such positions, 
with the activities and inner workings 
of the Fort Wayne community. 

Out of the several methods ot being 
admitted to the program. Franklin 
jokes that she "got in the easy way," 
being selected by the program's 
sponsors to participate under a full 
scholarship. Fifteen area businesses, 
such as Lincoln National Corp., 
General Telephone, and the Fori 
Wayne Public Transportation Cor- 
poration, paid to send representatives 
to the one day a month program. 

Franklin graduated from Duhe 
University in 1971 with a degree In 
Psychology and received a MS-BA frwn 
IPFW in 1964. She joined the IPFW 



faculty in December 1985 and entered 
her current position in July 1986. At the 
present, she is responsible for coor- 
dinating all of the Chancellor's major 
community functions, such as the 
Forte" Festival. She is also involved in 
the ongoing re-evaluation of IPF,W. 
Ftankhn said through the program. 



she will be able to expand her horizons 
and obtain a more in-depth un- 
derstanding of the community and its 
major personalities. She said she felt 
the professional performance of par- 
ticipants in Leadership Fort Wayne 
could be positively affected by 
enlarging their perspective on com- 



munity affairs, 

Franklin said perhaps the most 
positive affect the class will have on her 
will be lhe large number of contacts in 
the community, many different 
professions she will develop both by 
working wilh her classmates and the 
program's past participants.

Financial aid cutbacks: 
future jeopardized 
for needy students 



TRey say that life in America gets 
better for each coming generation. 

Many of today's professionals ai^ 
better educated, have lietter careers and 
make more money than their parents 
and grandparents. 

However, recent changes in federal 
regulations on college aid have made it 
difficult for middle income families to 
qualify for aid in two of the more 
frequently found methods students use. 

The Guaranteed Student Ixian (GSL), 
first of all, is no longer so guaranteed. 
Previously, anyone whose income, or 
whose parents' income was less than 
(30.000 was qualified for a GSL, The 
loans distributed at an eight percent 
interest rate, will likely be cut by about 
30 percent because of the changes 
Reagan approved last October. Now, all 
applicants must meet a needs test — 
based on many factors — that previously 
only applicants listing an income 
greater than S30.000 had to meet. The 
factors questioned include income, 
assets, savings, number of children, 
number of children in college and the 
cost of the school they attend. 

Sound fair? Maybe But read on 

The other major change concerns how 
students declare themselves 
independent Prior to this year, a 
student had only to live away from home 
for a year and not tte claimed by parents 
for tax purposes. This would qualify the 
student, whose income is probably 
substantially lower than his parents, as 
an independent Thus, the student would 
qualify for more aid, or at least a GSL, a 
GUARANTEED student loan. 

But thai is in the pasl, too. 

Now a student has to be 24 years old to 
declare independence. The exceptions 
are orphans, wards of the court, 
veterans, married students or students 
with legal dependents. 

Still sound promising? Probably not. 

The admmistration can tell us how the 
GSL program costs taxpayers S3 billion 
in interests and defaults a year 

The administration can boast about 
how they have increased the amount 
students can borrow from $25,000 for 
iinder.gradu3tg,and"Eradyate studies to 
^,750. If students can't qualify, how 
can they borrow? Perhaps, the latter 
move was just a token gesture on the 
government's part. 

It is depressing to consider the recent 
moves to decrease federal aid and at the 
same time think about the futures of our 
youth, College costs are rising; federal 
grants and loans are cut What is leff A 
future that seems bleek for many 
promising minds. 

Consider the student who comes from 
a large family and is blessed as the 
youngest of six children. All of the 
student's siblings have careers and are 



very successful. At the same time, the 
student's parents, after raising six 
children on a combined income that was 
never much larger than 522,000, are now 
semi-retired. In all likelihood, they are 
saving for retirement. They are happy, 
having been able to pay all their 
children's education through high 
school; unfortunately, they could not 
afford the college tuition that goes with 
six children. Or at least do that and put 
food on the table at the same time. So, 
like many "middle-income" families, 
the student has to pay for his or her 
education 

If they live at home — or even on 
campus for that matter — it will be 
awful difficult to get financial aid with 
the recent changes. If the student lives 
at home he will probably need 
transportation to get to school, work and 
back home, creating an added expense. 
Maybe he has a part-time job That 
income will pay for the cost of books and 
possibly transportation for a year, plus 
minor personal expenses. Where does 
the rest come from? The governmenf 
No, The parents? The government 
thinks so. On paper, this student's 
parents look wealthy. Maybe they have a 
few thousand in the bank. So what if only 
one parent is working and making 
S15,000 a year. Together, the student and 
one parent make 519,000 for a household 
of three. That's enough to get by They 
can spare, according to the 
administration's thinking, an extra S3000 
or $4000, Can't they' 

Apparently, the government thinks 
they can force the parents to pay 
because the education is worth it. Sure, 
it is worth it, no one will argue that. But 
then agam, paying heal and light bills, 
home mortgages and car loans and 
buying groceries are important too. 
Where does the money come for that? 

Is the next generation really more 
lucky than the one it is following? Maybe 
not Today's society increasingly relies 
on a public that is educated, on citizens 
who know how to devise better, 
advanced life support systems, 
computers, cars ... and even the star 
.wars techniques Reagan supports so 
heartily. Today's youth in America 
shouldn't have to face such a poor 
outlook. Many kids dream of the chance 
to attend college and "move the world" 
when they graduate. 

Just try and explain to them why they 
can't. Explain to the next ten or 11-year- 
old child you see why they probably 
won't get any governmental aid to pay 
for their college tuition. Tell them 
they can't afford a college tuition. 

While you are at it, say boodbye to a 
future doctor, engmeer, lawyer or 
teacher.

article in question put Ihe 
Flames ina negative context

lets be fair in reporting. 
Comparing 35 years ex-

Flames. Why such an article 
was approved and published 



IS a disgrace for this paper. 

The Flames is a business. 
It has it's officers and 
stockholders who have in- 
vested time, money and 
"energy into developing into a 
successful investment. Like 
any business it will take time 
before anyone will know if its 
a success, i Normally il lakes 
3 years to find out if any 
business is successful,) This 
paper has done an injustice 
lo Ihe Flames for the way il 
has compared it lo a totally 
different pro sports team. 

Because the product of this 
business is public en- 
lertainmenl, Ihls paper has 
mislead the public. For 
example: would this paper 
wrile such an article, (under 
the same circumstances?), 
comparing a new depart- 
ment store in Fort Wayne 
againsi an established one? 



And then lell ever.vone not lo

its first few weeks of

If you found yoursell once 
again dreaming of snow 
cancellations last week, 
there was good reason. 
Monday morning, Jan 19, 
Fort Wayne and surrounding 
counties were hit wilha snow 
storm that, along with 
thunder and lightning, left 
8 Z inches of fluff in ils wake. 
IPFW cancelled classes for 
that afternoon and evening. 
Later thai evening officials 
al IPFW made the decision 
lo cancel classes for 
Tuesday 

In the Jan. 15 issue nf The 
Communicator, John Car- 
nagW, vice chancellor of 
financial affairs, stated that 
the overriding philosophy of 
the university was lo remain 



open. With that recently

people were surprised al

pifiisanlly surprised that is.' 

University Police staled 
classes weresuspended so as 
to enable crews to clear 
all parking lots. This seems 
justifiable as 8.2 inches of 
drifting snow is no easy task 
to handle. 

The University should be 
commended for the closing 
of IPFW. The roads in the

*Mercy^ has unique 
quality and ending 

B&gt; MICHELLE LYNN New Orleans. To get to the 



ERTEL 
Surt Writer 
"No Mercy" is a movie 
directed by Richard Pearce 
and starring Richard Gere 
as Eddie Jillele, a Chicago 
police officer. 



Review 



Gere's parlner is killed 
and the only lead Gere has lo 
the killer is a strawberry 
blonde named Michelle 
played by Kim Basinger. 
BaHJneer adds a unique 
qtullty to the film because 
her character is surrounded 
in mystery 

The movie starU out in 
Chicago, but Basinger leads 
G«re to Algiers, a ghetto in 



Gere kidnaps 
Basinger, the killer's 
girlfriend. The movie ends in 
showdown Ijetween the 
killer and Gere with 
Basinger adding more 
suspense lo the movie. 

1 thought the movie would 
be (tiled with graphic sex 
and violence, knowing past 
movies of Gere's. I was 
pleasantly surprised 
because there was no 
graphic sex scenes and 
hardly any violence. 

The movie itself was very 
entertaining and kept me 
very interested until the very 
end. I would recommend 
"No Mercy" as a worthwhile 
movie to see. It is currently 
playing at Georgetown 
Cinemas.

Ford buys town 
to fulfill vision 



By MICHELLE LYNN 

EBTEL 

SUfI Writer 

Harrison Ford's most 

recent movie role as Allie 
Fox in "The Mosquito 
CoasI" was a modern day 
Robinson Crusoe adventure. 
Helen Mirren stars as his 
loyal wife, and River 
Phoenix portrays Ford's son, 
Charlie Fox Phoenix's 
character idolizes his father 
and his father's ideas. 
Phoenix gives a good per- 
formance and adds en- 
tertaining quality to the film. 



Review 



Mosquito CoasI." Photo courtesy of 



The story starts out on an 
asparagus farm in the 
United Stales. Ford portrays 
an inventor who is tired of 
the American way of life He 



admires the basic way of 
living of immigrants from 
Central America. Ford 
decides lo move to Central 
America, the Mosquito 
CoasI. He buys an entire 
town and he and his family 
are going to rebuild the 
desolated place. Ford has a 
vision of how life will be in 
his own town. 

Three visitors threaten 
Ford's dream. Suddenly his 
vision and town turn to total 
chaos. Ford then leads his 
family on a wild chase lo find 
his vision again. His family 
begins to doubt him and 
starts rebelling against him. 

The story ends leaving you 
with an empty feeling. 
wondering what will happen 
to the family The movie 
holds viewers' attention until 
the last half hour, when it 
becomes drawn out and very 
tedious. 



AIDS: 1.5 million carry virus 



Bv MICHELLE LYNN 

ERTEL 

Slalf Writer 

Aids? What do we know 
alwul this disease? In just 
four more years, the disease 
will have killed more 
Americans than the Vietnam 
and Korean wars combined, 
according lo U.S. News and 
World Report, 

But what exactly is AIDS? 
AIDS is a disease in which 
there is a deficiency in the 
functioning of the body's 
immune system involving a 
virus called HTLV-III, ac- 
cording lo Indiana Stale 
Board of Health. The af- 
fected individual becomes 
unusually susceptible to 
certain serious infections 
and malignancies Al the end 
ol 1986, more than 29,000 



Americans had contracted 
AIDS. An estimated total of 
1,370 heterosexuals, ac- 
cording to U.S. News and 
World Report statistics, will 
have died from AIDS by 
1987. 

AIDS is no longer just a 
problem for homosexuals 
but is moving rapidly into 
the heterosexual society. 
The reason for the increase 
of AIDS in heterosexuals is 
due to intravenous drug 
users and bisexuals who do 
nol realize they actually 
carry the disease and thus 
spread it. The Cenler for 
Disease Control estimates 
thai 1.5 million Americans 
now carry the virus but 
display no symptoms. 
BecauseAIDShasa long and 
indeterminate incubation 



period, you or your partner 
may carry the disease thus 
spreading it around with 
perfect innocence perhaps 
for more than lOyears. 

AIDS is transmitted by 
intimate sexual contact, 
sharing of hypodermic 
needles, transfusion of blood 
or blood products, and 
transmission from mother to 
infant before or at the time 
of birth. The virus is 
present in blood, semen and 
saliva. Transfer of one or 
more of these body fluids 
between sexual partners 
seems to be the mechanism 
by which the virus is spread, 
according to Indiana State 
Board of Health. 

People who are at risk of 
having AIDS are those who 
are sexual active with 



homosexuals or bisexuals, 
present or past abusers of 
intravenous drugs, patients 
with hemophilia, people with 
multiple sex partners and 
people with exposure to 
prostitutes. 

Informing the public about 
this serious disease may be a 
factor in its widespread 
consequences. The media 
has been very reluctant to 
permit "safe sex" ad- 
vertisements on billboards 
and in newspapers tor fear of 
offending public sensibility. 

It was last October, five 
years after the disease was 
detected in the U.S.. that 
Surgeon General C. Everett 
Koop issued his first public 
report on AIDS. Every year 
since 1M4, the White House 
has proposed spending less 
on AIDS programs than the 
Public Health Service wants 
and much less than Congress 
eventually put aside. The 
AIDS budget of.S^ll million 
for 1987 is almosti'double the 
administration's proposal. 
Part of the reason for federal 
foot traffing, critics charge, 
is thai AIDS still strikes 
largely at groups outside 
society's mainstream. 

As to dale there is no cure 
for the fatal disease of AIDS. 
There are tests available to 
determine whether or not 
you have the disease. AIDS 
hotline (B00447-ArDSl is 
available to ask questions of 
physicians assistants from 
Ihehoursof Sam. to7p m.

Mastodons take 
FWNB Classic 



ByDARRENJ. 
WAGGONER 
Sports Edilor 

Fresh from taking the 
championship in their own 
Fort Wayne National Bank 
Volleyball Classic, the IPFW 
men's volleyball squad took 
on another tough challenge 
last weekend when they 
traveled to University Park. 
Pennsylvania to participate 
in the Penn State 
Invitational. 

The Volleydons lost to 
Penn State 15-10, 15-S and IS- 
3 before defeating Western 
Ontario 15-11, 15-11, 15-11 
Next on the list was Navy 
whom they defeated 10-15. 
15-0. B-15, 15-7 and 15^. 
George Mason handed them 
a solid 15-6. 15-1, 15-B set- 

IPFW took three matches 
in the FWNB Classic in- 
cluding wins over Navy, a 
top 20 team last year, and 
final four participant Ohio 
State, but needed foilr games 
to defeat upstart New Jersey 
Stale. 

Coach Arnie Ball knows 
his squad faces a lough 
early-season slate but feels 
the play against top 20 
competition will do his team 



got to play 
these tj'pes of teams if you 
want to improve," Ball said. 
"Win or lose, you're going to 
be a better team for having 
played the Iwst," 

In other news: Volleyball 
monthly has published its 
preseason top 10 with 
perennial power UCLA 
lopping the chart. Midwest 
Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association opponent Ball 
Stale is ranked tenlh. while 
IPFW is listed just below the 
lop group in "Best of (he 
Rest." 

Sophomore outside hitter 
Jay Golsteyn (West Allis, 
Wisconsin) is listed as a 
preseason honorable 
mention All-American. Also 
earning mention in "Best of 
the Hest" are MIVA op- 
ponents Ohio State and

Quest for GLVC win continues 



ByDARRENJ. 
WAGGONER 
SporU Edilor 

Still searching for their 
first conference win of the 
season, the IPFW women's 
basketball team will have a 
couple of opportunities to 
pick up their initial GLVC 
win with two away games 
this week. IPFW, 3-15 and 0-8 
in the conference, will travel 
to Kentucky Wesleyan, 



Thursday, twfore a contest 
with Southern Indiana on 
Saturday 

The L^dy Wildcats from 
Wesleyan lake a 6-10 record 
to the contest including a 66- 
62 victory over the Dons last 
week. Cheryl Reynolds 
usually comes oft the bench 
for Wesleyan but she tops the 
leamal 11.4 points per game. 
Holly Brown and Willia 
Haynes are also important 
parts of the balanced attack. 



Southern Indiana. 7-8 on 
the year with a 4-3 GLVC 
mark, is led by Tina Diele at 
17.1 points per game. Connie 
Van Meter chips in 13.7 
points while Janet Brown 
tops the Lady Eagles with G.9 
rebounding average. Last 
week the Lady Eagles edged 
IPFW 67-63 on the road. 

FYeshman Teena Merrell 
is averaging H.8 points and 7 
rebounds to pace the Lady 



Dons in both categories. She 
has also converted B7 per- 
cent of her free throws and 
was ranked fif Ih in the nation 
in Division II in that 
statistic. Lori Miller, 13.4 
points, and Bev Miller. 10.6 
are also averaging in double 
figures. 

The Lady Dons return 
home on February Sth to 
lake on GLVC rival Lewis 

University. 



Thompson: Wise choice for Seoul 



Seoul, South Korea, 19SS, is 
just around the comer, and 
for the first time we have an 
Olympic basketball coach 
that's over 6-foot-4 inches 
tall: John Thompson, the 
towel-wringing, resident 
capital-G genius of 
Georgetown University. 

For the few who are un- 
familiar, he's known as "Big 
Bad John" lo his opponents 
in the B^t of Ten East — a 
strong, General Patton, Lee 
laeocca liberty person who's 
very patriotic, and in my 
mind at least, there's no 
doubt thati he was a clear-cut 
choice if the U.S. is to 
maintain the gold once 
again. 

First off. he was an 
assistant to Dean Smith of 
North Carolina in Montreal, 
whenwewoninI976. And. he 
also helped in selecting the 
material for Bobby Knight of 
Indiana in 19H4. 

Positives'" "Big Bad 
John" is loaded. His style of 
play was created for the 
Olympics — coasl-lo-coasl 
pressure on D, and a giddy- 
up offense, which if it doesn't 
immediately convert, is 
followed by patient patterns. 
Coacli John also knows how 
to use a long bench, which is 
a definite asset because of 
the physical style of in- 
ternational play, and which 
means that at least 10 of the 
12 U.S. Olympians will be 
sure to get their fair share of 
PT 

One other thing: Coach 
John also has a complete 
understanding of in- 
ternational rules, and he also 
spent time last summer with 
Coach Lute Olson of Arizona 
at the World Games m 
Madrid. Make no mistake, 
he is no stranger to the in- 
ternational bullring. 

So, those are all the 
positives. All the items on 
the asset side of the ledger 




Now, 1 think, it's time we got 
on lo the list of things on the 
liability side — things that 
Coach John, or for that 
matter, any Olympic coach, 
has to deal with this lime 
around. 

First off. this is not a 
summer Olympics, but a 
Games of the tall, when the 
leaves are starting to turn. It 
goes from September to 
October, which creates 
major headaches tor the 
National Basketball 
Association flow, for 
example, can a senior who 
was drafted in the spring be 
watching Ihe sunset on the 
Yellow Sea at a lime when 
NBA clute are already 
through their training camp 
and getting ready for their 
season opener' 

As it that weren't enough, 
let's take a look at problem 
number 2, which concerns 
the athletes who are still in 
college. Right now, it looks 
like they'd be missing at 
least three weeks of class — 
which is a no-no — unless 
you figure to lake 'em out for 
the whole semester. And, 
believe me, that's a no-no to 
the poor college coach who 
has recruited the kid and has 
himonhisteam. 

As far as the college 
basketball players are 
concerned, I think what 
you'll see is a reaching into 
and response from the

who would go through 
training and the traveling

Coach John. quite 
naturally, is reacting to all 
this with top hat and cane 
diplomacy. 

The only comment he'll 
make about all the problems 
is that he would like to have 
three Patrick Ewings in his 
selection of a team, and that 
he plans to spend quite a bit 
of lime this year at the Pan- 
Am Games in Indianapolis, 
where Denny Crum ot 
Louisville is handling the 
head coaching duties. What 
Coach John hopes lo do there 
is to gel a big leg up on 
evaluating the prospective 
ballplayers, and get some 
feeling on what the desires 
and commitments of certain 
players will be, before they 
start the 1987-88 college 

What does he need? First 
of all, he'll he looking for 
players mainly that can play 
up-court. who can defense 
the three-point shot, and who 
are mobil as well as 



physical. Olympic games 
are played in a push-shove, 
grunt, mulliplc-foul type 
style, and you must 
remember that John will not 
have the big advantage of 
'84. when we were on our 
own blacktop in LaLa Land. 
which made it super inviting 
for the players who wanted 
to use the Five Rings and the 
Olympic Anthem to open 
doors and gain exposure into 
the financial league, the 
NBA, 

Another thing to 
remember: one of the dif- 
ficult things, too, now that 
Coach John has picked up 
the OljTnpic torch, is that he 
will have two head coaching 
jobs. He has to be careful not 
to put in too much time on 
the Olympics, so that it 
might adversely affect Ws 
Hoyas, or vice-versa. And 
there are the constant 
rumors that the pros want 
him. which can be a fatal 
distraction if he allows it to 
turn his head too soon. 

You know, it's ironic. 
When John Thompson was a 
senior at Providence in 19&amp;1, 
he tried to make the Olympic 
team that was gomg to 
Tokyo, and ended up in 
Heartbreak Hotel. And now, 
how the world turns, tor here 
we are approximately a 
quarter-century later, and 
now he's the head man, 
NumeroUno. 

Personally, I'm really 
pleased that I'll be in this 
giant's shadow, when I'm 
covering the Games in Seoul 
tor the Peacock in '88, For 
now, we can only wish him — 
and his eventual team which 
has yet to be born — the besi
