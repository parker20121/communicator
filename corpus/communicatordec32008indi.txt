"why docs the river smell 
so bad? How can water 
possibly be safe when It 
smells so toxic before it's 
treated? 

Safety of our river wa- 
ter in Fori Wayne is not 
the big question. Rather, 
(he smell of It is. 

The explanation be- 



gins with the color of the 
SI. Joseph River. Clearly, 
it is brown. The actual 
shade can be described 
as desen sand on a clean- 
er water day and dark 
chocolate on a bad day. 
If you drive past the riv- 
er and see die water for 
yourself, you will want 
to completely forget the 
fact that the St. Joe is the 
primary source of Fori 
Wayne drinking water. 



Remember, it's filtered, 

IPFW Student Rachel 
Bullock agrees that the 
color of (he river is dis- 
heartening. "1 used to go 
10 the river after school 
and take pictures of the 
ducks. Now all 1 see is 
brown water," she said. 

There are two rea- 
sons why the water in 
the Saint Joseph river 
isn't clear. First, there is 
a large amount of mud 
build-up, and human 
and animal excrement 
make their way into the 
river, one way or anoth- 
er. It's a rather disgusting 
fact that the excrement- 
laced water is fihered and 
then we drink it; but. it's 
much more sanitary than 
in other countries where 
they have no filters at all. 
"I can't bring myself to 
even go near the river 
anymore: seeing it sick- 
ens me," Bullock added 
Consequendy, the 



Fort Wayne water 



Tlic Fort Wayne City 
Utilities diligently sends 
out a report detailing the 
average findings in each 
year's water supply to 
customers. The Annual 
Drinking Water Qual- 
ity Report for Fort Waj-ne 
City Utilities shows no 
major problems with the 
safety of the water. "All 
test results were better 
than health standards 
require," the report says. 
However, the result sheet 
nlso adds, "drinking wa- 
ter may reasonably be ex- 
pected to contain at least 
small amounts of some 
contaminants." Basical- 
ly, there ivill always be 
small amounts of con- 
taminants, possibly 
Including radioacti\' 
materials 
in the \va- 
ter. Some 
CD lit ami- 
nants will 
be simply 
unavoid- 
able. That 
said, the an- 
nual report 
fails to include 
a complimen- 
tary scratch and 
sniff river sticker. Scent 
doesnt seem to be a con- 
cern at all. 

Not many people 
know where Fort Wayne's 
drinking water conies 
from, "The St. loseph 
Ri\Tr is the sole source 
of drinking water for the 
citizens ser\'ed by Fort 
Wayne City Utilities. Raw- 



water is pumped to the 
plant from the St. loseph 
River Dam located near 
North Anthony and Coli- 
seum Boulevards." says 
the consumer report. 

There it is. The water 
that smells nauseating 
is the primary' source of 
Fort Wayne's water. Not 
to worry though, the wa- 
ter is filtered and cleaned 
before consumers 




How does that 
explain the varia- 
tion of water you may 
find on campus? .\t The 
Communicator, we like 
coffee and sometimes, 
when the editor-in-chief 
goes to fill up the coffee 
pot, what he brings back 
is cloudy water. This 
happens for a number of 
reasons. First, the Water 
Maintenance &amp; Sen-ice 
DiWsion recommends 
running abnormally 



colored water for a few 
minutes until it returns 
to its usual coloring. Oc- 
casionally, minerals and 
deposits become con- 
centrated in the pipes 
and then when the spigot 
is finally turned on after 
not being used, the con- 
centrated material pro- 
duces cloudy water. 

If you call the City 
Utilities Water Hodine, 
the calm recording will 
tell you that, "during 
the winter months, 
water can appear very 
cloudy," and that it 
is not a large con- 
cern. The line 
will also tell 
you everything 
you wanted to 
know about Fort 
Wayne rivers. 
Like, h is not rec- 
ommended tliat the 
St. Mar\''s River be 
used for recreational 
sports, or any type of 
body submersion, as it 
is much too contaminat- 
ed at the present time. 

In addition to the 
cloudy ivaters of Walb, 
yau can also find rust 
colored water on cam- 
pus, typically in keitler 
or the Science Building. 
The red di sh - b ro wni va ler 
simply indicates an ex- 
cess of iron. Brown-black 
water is a sign of excess 
manganese, another ele- 
ment.

particles breaking down 
in mud and excrement 
create craz&gt;' smells from 
elements tike sulfur. Sul- 
fur is also the reason why 
people with wells often 
experience "rotten egg 
water." 

In the river, die bacte- 
ria releases compounds, 
which interact with the 
air to produce an even 
stronger scent. The same 
can be said if you drive 
past a garbage dump. 
When the chemicals 
break down, they release 



compounds. The com- 
pounds intermingle vrith 
air and a horrible odor 
emerges. 

"If you can isolate 
where that smell [ofsew- 
agel is coming from, I 
would contact the City 
of Fort Wayne." Renken- 
berger said. He said he 
was unaware of a smell 
and recommends that 
those concerned contact 
the city. 

You are not in luck. 
The river odor is not go- 
ing away anytime soon. 



So next time you'te taking 
a walk and you're going 
to be in the viciniij' of the 
river, bring a gas mask. 
You'll save &gt;'our nose, and 
maybe your body, from 
breathing in the toxic 
ftimes of Fori Wayne's 
very own rampant brown 
river of doom. For more 
information about the 
quality of water you use 
daily, call die City Utifi-

Let's face it: If we are

we are just going lo have

a way to sacrifice what we 
can for the greater good. 
And if we could just find 
some way lo increase 
Black Friday's sales by, 
say, 200 or even 300 per- 



centage points in 2009, 
think about the good il 
would do our economy. 

So let's make sure that 
in 20m. Black Friday Is 
an even greater success. 

When preparing for 
your Black Friday festivi- 
ties next year, don'l for- 
get your essentials: a list 
of the gifts you're looking 
for. a winter coat for the 
overnight wait, your Kev- 
lar vest and your steel- 
toed boots. 

Remember, the econ- 
omy is counting on you. 



Take Emmanuel. An 
avid supporter of Israel, 
the former senior adviser 
in the Clinton adminis- 
tration is known to be 
tough and idealistic — in 
the early '90s he did a 
brief stint as a volunteer 
mechanic in Israelduring 
the Gulf War. He's exactly 
the kind of man anti-Is- 
rael leftists don't want in 
the White House — and 
that makes me feel good. 
Besides, when members 
of Al-Qaeda are publicly 
endorsing Obama. it's 
clear we need a public 
official who knows the 
Middle East and is able 
to take a firm stance on 
the issues related to that 
region. 

Then there's Timothy 



Geithner, Obama's pick 
for treasury secretary. A 
kind of Wall Street wun- 
derkind, Geithner gen- 
erally isn't viewed in a 
partisan light. And his 
knowledge of the ins and 
outs of the American fi- 
nancial system is essen- 
tial at a time when that 
system is going through 
a prolonged crisis. And, 
of course, there's Hillary. 
If anything, choosing her 
to be secretary of state is 
symbolic of Obama's ap- 
parent refusal to kowtow 
to the expectations of the 
far lefL It's also a decision 
that illustrates a bold- 
ness i like. No longer is 
Obama the golden chUd 
of the left: he's making 
decisions that have re- 



percussions even among 
his own party members, 
but decisions that he 
feels confident about re- 
gardless. 

More significantly, 
though, many of Obama's 
choices are centrists. 
The conservatives' fear 
that an Obama admin- 
istration would move 
this country far to the 
left seems superfluous 
now. There's no question 
Obama has made many 
good choices in the past 
few weeks. Because of 
this, Americans — con- 
servatives, moderates 
and liberals alike — have . 
a lot to be optimistic

Top Ten Holiday Shopping Tips 

10. You can have a custom message printed on just about any- 
thing. Finally, you can get your father that "World's 43rd Great- 
est Dad" mug. 

9. Instead of buying your brother that John Grisham novel he 
asked for, just give him a phone bock. It's longer, has more 
charaaers, and the plot's just as good. 

8. If you're buying your sister some socks, make sure they match 
her earrings. 

7. Don't bother shopping for your brother's nev/ girlfriend. She's 
just a lav\/n gnome. 

6. People love homemade gifts. Try making your girlfriend some 
lingerie out of a vi/elcome mat. 

5. Got a C5I fan on your list? Consider buying them a UV light. 
They can spend the holidays solving The Mystery of the Filthy 
Bed Sheets. 

4, Instead of buying your girlfriend expensive clothes and cos- 
metics, why not save some cash and just take off your glasses? 

3. If you're the arts and crafts type, you can make your own 
Christmas tree with nothing but glue, some pipe cleaners, and 
a large axe, 

2. Your boyfriend loves Scotland, so why not buy him a kilt? A 
kilt with a satin bodice, spaghetti straps and a matching purse. 

1. If you get your uncle a gun and a ski mask, he'll get you an 
iPhone and some guy's wallet.

"The biggest reason 
liie water is brown is due 
lo the suspended sedi- 
ments, most commonly 
clay particles." said Rod- 
ney Renkenberger, Ex- 
ecutive Director of the 
Maiimee River Basin 
Commission. 

Those concerned 
\^ith safety \vill be glad to 
know that the Fort Wayne 
City Utilities water re- 
ceived the score of A' for 
lead and copper, mean- 
ing the water does not 
carry dangerous levels. 

Another large con- 
cern among consumers 
of the water is the accu- 
racy of the annual water 
reports. The statement 
that Fort Wayne water 
exceeded all health stan- 
dards may lead some to 
beLeve the numbers were 



skewed and that it is all 
a conspiracy. However, 
the EPA keeps close labs 
on local water systems. 
If a water filiralion plant 
does not report its results 
for a year, or there seems 
to be a discrepancy, the 
EPA posts the infonma- 
tion on its data website. 
For example, in 2004, 
the Three Rivers Filtra- 
tion received a violation 
report for inadequate re- 
porting ofdata. 

There seems to 
be no way to hide from 
the EPA. If they don't 
receive data, the water 
company will hear from 
them and the results wOl 
be posted online for citi- 
zens to dissect. 

For the Fort 
Wayne City Utilities wa- 
ter, not only do they have 



to report to the EPA, but 
they also have the Indi- 
ana Department of Envi- 
ronmental Management 
looking over their shoul- 
der. The management 
department sets strin- 
gent standards that must 
be followed, or a viola- 
tion is in order. 

Ihe department 
also follows the federal 
Clean Water Act. "Sec- 
tion 305(b) of the Clean 
Water Act requires the 
state to assess and report 
on how well the waters of 
Indiana support the ben- 
elicia] uses,* the website 
says. Hence, it's very dif- 
ficult to fabricate data or 
assert false assumptions. 
It can happen, but with 
so many organizations 
scrutinizing, it's a fairly 
unlikely conjecture.

Leaving Scratch Marks 

Nine Inch Nails rocics the Coliseum 




By Craig Lloyd 



As Ihc only oriiciDl 
mombcr of Nine Inch 
Niiils, lYent Rcznor is re- 
spnnsibte for all ihe mu- 
sic made by tlie indus- 
irial ruck band. In otiier 
wards, he is ilic only mu- 
sician you will hear on Ihc 
hand's albums, with ihc 
exception of a few songs. 
Heznor formed Nine Inch 
Nulls hack In ISBB. 

After 20 years, the 
band is still alive and well. 
Wtierc were they recently? 
The band madf a stop in 



Fort Wayne on November stall earplugs to block 32 

lath. VVidi a free ticket in of the approximately 150 

hand, there was no reason decibels of a typical rock 

for me not to check il out. concert. I could still hear 

Wliile roaming everything perfectly, but 

through the hallways on it prevented mc from hav- 

theoutskirtsofdieMemo- ing severe hearing loss on 

rial Coliseum. I bean) the ihe spot. Once I found my 
speclacu- 



"... bleeding through 
the section openings," 



sound 
of Nine 
Inch Nails 
bleeding 
through 

the section "^^ 

openings, which meani 
that the concert unfor- 
tunately started without 
me. Luckily. I didn't miss 
much. I proceeded to in- 



1 fo- 
cused 



from to see TVent Reznor 
and his touring band 
sweating it up on stage. 

Not only did the band 
impress me, but the 



light show was definitely 
something to gaze at. The 
stage featured three mas- 
sive cage-like panels that 
spanned the width of the 
stage. All three were titled 
with thousands of LEDs 
that were wired for video 
display. For a portion of 
the concert, the band was 
sandwiched in between 
the massive panels, but 
remained visible while 
rocking out. The displays 
also featured iniricate ef- 
fects that Included a rain 
downpour and abstract 
shapes that went along 
with Ihe music. 

Along with crowd fa- 
vorites like "Closer". Nine 
Inch Nails included a few 
tracks from the Ghost al- 
bum which Includes all 
instrumental songs. Many 
unique instruments ac- 
companied the band dur- 
ing that time such as elec- 
tric dulcimers, a drum 
machine, an upright bass, 
and a xylophone. 

Thi; band ended iheir 
triumphant show with 
two up-beat crowd pleas- 
ers, "The Hand That 
Feeds" and "Head Like A 
Hole", which is a 20 year 
old track that is still kick- 
ing butt. Unfortunately, il 
left the crowd (including 
me) annoyingly humming 
Nine Inch Nails tunes for 
the next few days. Never- 
theless, the concert was 
definitely something not 
to miss out on. Even if 
you're not a big Nine Inch 
Nails fan like I was, you 
should still look into go- 
ing to one of their shows. 
It will be well worth your 
lime.

Wlial comes to mind 
when you think Guns and 
Roses? Songs about au- 
tumnal showers, heaven- 
ly metropolises, and lov- 
able children, this would 
be correct had you been 
talking about the original 
line-up. Their songs that 
would later come to be 
Known as classics were 
bluesy, full of soul and 
highly identifiable. No- 
body else sounds any 

thing like lead singer 
.■\xl Rose, and that lyas 



in 1985, Fast fonvard 23 
years, six albums, and 
midtipte changes in the 
line-up, and the only 
thing that remains the 
same about GNR is Axl 
Rose himself 

On November 23, 
2008, the highly anticipat- 
ed Chinese Democracy- 
album was released. The 
band's first album since 
The Spaghetti Incident 
which was released back 
in 1993. makes Chinese 
Democracy GNR's first 
album in 15 years. This 
is not TOur granddaddys 
Guns and Roses: Ihe al- 
biuuieatures^ brand new 



line up including Bucket- 
head and Nine Inch Nails' 
Robin Finch. /\xl Rose is 
the sole reluming mem- 
ber from GNR's original 
incarnation. There are 
14 original tracks about 
love, loss, forgiveness and 
peace. 

With new members 
comes a new sound, and 
Chinese Democracy has 
a complex assortment of 
rhyihms and beats. It is 
more than just rock and 
roll: it has elements of 
hip-hop. rap. and classi- 
cal Mith copious amounts 
of s\-nlhesizer work very 
. similar to tbe sotmd ol. 



The Mars Volta. f\xl did 
manage to stay true lo 
the essence of the original 
Guns and Roses by fitting 
in a powerful rock ballad. 
All in all, Chinese Democ- 
racy is a quality album. 
Some classic rock fiinda- 
mentalists would say oth- 
erwise, due to the fact that 
Rose Is the only returning 
member from the original 
Une-up. 

Over time all things 
change, and rock bands, 
especially 80 s rock bands, 
are no excepuon. So put 
all bias aside and open up

Gingerbread Festival 

2008 begins 



By Louisa Danietson 



Ii's beginning to look, 
&lt;ind smell, a lot like 
Christmas - especially 
If you sicp inio ihc His- 
lory Cenler of Ihc Allen 
(&gt;iiinty/ForI Wayne His- 
torical Society. 

Up on the second 
floor of the old county 
court house, in what 
Wiis once the courtroom, 



about 105 gingerbread 
confections, decorated 
with every kind of candy 
and frosting combina- 
tion imaginable, are dis- 
played. Spicy ginger, 
rich vanilla and exhila- 
rating peppermint per- 
meate the room. From 
cathedrals to computers 
and robots, creativity in 
cookie dough abounds. 
Both professional food 
artisans and amateurs 
have displayed entries 
for the festival. 



The Festival is open 
from Friday, Nov. 28 to 
Sunday, Dec. 14. during 
regular History Center 
hours. Admission is free 
to History Center mem- 
bers and children five 
and younger, $2 for prc- 
scheduled group tours, 
and S5 for adults, S3 for 
seniors and students. For 
more information, con- 
tact lamia Alexander at

This gingerbread house, one from the ages 3 to 6 group, is decorated wilh 
mnls. Slarbursls and ribbon candy. 



ow to Build 

a Gingerbread Bungalow 






E By Louisa Danielson 



You will need: 

1 large cutting board 

2 boxes of Dominoes 
Sugar Cubes Dots 

1 can of Belly Crocker 
Easy Flow Decorating 
Icing 

1 batch of Gingerbread 
Dough, pn^ mixed and 
chilled 

Star cuke decorations 

2 mini Kit Kat bars 

1 I lershcys nuni bar 
1 fruit leather strip 
Creen and Yellow salt 
I sheet of cardboard, 
about 12x10* 

Whal to do; 

1. On the cutting 
board, space sugar 
cubes in a small rect- 
angle. Side walls should 
be about 9 cubes long, 
front and back walls 7 
cubes wide. 

2. Carefully spread a 
thin line of frosting on 
the board in the rect- 
angular shape that the 
bungalow will cover. 
Place one row of sugar 
cubes on (he icing out- 
lineandletsetuniilfinii. 
Make sure the cubes are 
snugly spaced - no gaps 
between cubes'. 

3. Build walls Lego- 
style, Put a thin line of 
icing on top of the first 
layer of cubes, then 
carefully set another 
row of cubes on top 
of the fresh icing, be- 
.ing sure that the sugar 
Uiricks' are directly on 



lop of the other cubes. 

4. Continue building 
the walls until they are 
about 5 cubes high. 

5. On the front and 
back wails, stack sugar 
cubes into pyramids, 
forming a peak for the 
roof, cementing each 
layer with icing. 

l^ke thin cardboard 
(the kind that is an the 
backs of draiving tablets 
or reams of paper), and 
fold it in half, to form a 
roof. Be sure the peak 
of the cardboard roof is 
straight - this will deter- 
mine how straight the 
gingerbread roof will 
be. If the fold isn't quite 
right, cut the cardboard 
in half and tape the un- 
cut sides together. Fit 
the roof to the bunga- 
low; trim excess sides, if 
needed. The roof should 
give generous eves to the 
sides of the house and 
overhang the front and 
back of the bungalow by 
about an inch. Punch a 
hole in each comer of 
the cardboard roof and 
run string from comer 
lo comer, so the roof will 
stay siifBy peaked. Tie 
knots at each end of the 
string or run twist-tics 
through the holes and 
tighdy ttvisi around the 
knotted string- 

6. Take pre-mbted 
and chilled gingerbread 
dough and roll it out to 
14 inch thickness. TVim 
the dou^ into a rect- 
angle, the same size as 
the roof- Carefully dnipe 
the dough over the card- 
board faun, trim any 



excess (the parts that 
droop onto tlte pan past 
the eves) and bake as the 
recipe directs. 

7. Once the roof has 
cooled, carefully lift if 
from the cardboard form 
and Uy it on the bunga- 
low. Spread icing on the 
topmost sugar cubes of 
the bungalow, then gen- 
tly press the roof on top. 
Let icing dry until the 
roof is firm (let set over- 
night to a full day for best 
results), 

8. Fill in gaps between 
roof and sugar cubes 
with more icing, 

9. Decorate! 

lO.Lay Kit Kat bars for 
front steps. Use a fun-size 
Hershey bar for the front 
door, gluing it in with 
more icing. Dab a touch 
of frosting on large cake- 
sprinkle stars and attach 
to the roof of the bunga- 
low to create a pretty bor- 
der, like Christmas li^ts. 
Cut the fmit strip in half, 
then trim [^vo ends to 
form a rounded- lopped 
cathedral -shaped win- 
dow. Squirt some icing 
onto ihebungalow's back 
wall, then carefully press 
the window into the ic- 
ing- The while icing will 
blend in ^vith the white 
wall behind the Uanslu- 
cent fruit leather 

Add colored salt for 
ground cover. 

Colored Sail 

You will need: 

Yellow and green fiaod 

coloring 

Uo-iodized salt 



2 zip-iop sandwich bags 
Spoon for sprinkling salt 
ontowalicway 

In two separate zip- 
lop bags, pour several 
tablespoons of salt. For 
green grass, add about 
four drops of green food 
coloring to one bag of 
sail. Zip the lop shut and 
shake vigorously until all 
the salt is green. Do the 
same thing for the yellow 
salt in a separate bag 

Sift the yellow salt in 
front of the bungalow, 
like a sandy walkway, 
with the spoon. Then, 
spread the green salt 
around both the bunga- 
low and the path, tilting 
the salt out of the bag 
so as to keep the lawn as 
smooth as possible. 

Enjoy the results!

tailed mouse.

Men capitalize on MSU momentum, win ttiree of four 

■ Strong defensive effort keeps game with Michigan State close; Mastodons follow with wins over Eastern Illinois, in-state foe 



In All Directions opEd

IPFW mens basketball is now 
3-3, winners of three of their last 
four; a streak that shows that when 
Dane Fife says that his team can 
compete, you belter believe it. 

After a damn near pefectly 
impressing game against one of 
the top ten teams in the nation 
to start Homecoming week, the 
Mastodons rallied off three straight, 
including imposing their will on 

Eastern Illinois -^ 

and knocking 
out an in-state 
opponents. And 
now, can you 
question if this 
Mastodon team 
is for realT 
On November 
19, Michigan State became ihe first 
BigTenteaintovisit the Mastodons 
and iliey barely slipped out still 
alive, 70-59. They have since lost 
to Maryland, but the smothering 
defense of IPFW and Nick Daniels 
and Zach Plackemeier's ability to 
control against Ihe Sparian press 
almost led to the biggest upset 
of tlie young college basketball 
season. 

Last issue. I wrote about the big 
risk in playing teams like Michigan 
State and IPFW almost cashed in 
on the looming rc\%'ard. Literally, 
the team ivas 10-minutes a^vay 
from upending a Spartan team 
that in no way was prepared for 
the fire that Fife's squad brought 
to the table. 



they pulled off two huge wins 
over Eastern Illinois. All-in-all, 
the f^nthers are not a top-notch 
program but they are a very good 
one. More than that, Fife noted in 
the preseason that he wanted to 
change his team's ability to seal 
the deal at the end of close games. 
In an 81-77 overtime 
Homecoming win and a 76-74 
road win this past Saturday night 
at Eastern Illinois, the Mastodons 
did just that. The games were close 
and the team rallied behind their 
leader David Carson to seal two 
very big wins. Carson hit clutch 
free throws 




Feeding off that momentuin. 



(IjiiffpniEi) at the end of 

the first win 

(following 

some clutch 

charity shots 

of Ben Botts) 

and then 

knocked down 

a game ivinner at the Panthers 

with just less than two seconds on 

the clock. 

Takethosetivowins.lheMichigan 
State defensive showcase, throw 
in a 79-36 thrashing of lU-Easi 
and just like that, the Mastodons 
go from a major question mark to 
a scary team. 

On Monday, the played their last 
home game until December 31 
when they hosted Ball State, just 
the second time in IPRV's Division 
1 era that the nvo schools have met. 
Last season, the Cardinals got the 
best of the Mastodons. 69-62. 

This time, it was an Anthony 
NeweU buzzer-beater that shook 
the fiest&gt;- Masiodons, 54-52. 

TYey McCorkle was strong 
offensively and John Peckinpaugh 



was ace on defense despite fouling 
out of the contest. Though it was 
a loss in a close game, there was 
a silver lining in this one; IPFW 
played with heart even when shots 
weren't fallingat all. 

The missing piece to what could 
make this puzzle a contender in 
the Summit League is senior guard 
Jakari Johnson, who has yet to see 
any lloor time (minus his dozen 
or so minutes in the exhibition). 
An early ankle injury has taken 
Johnson out of the lineup for six 
games, despite only missing one 
game total in the previous two 
years. When Johnson returns, he 
may be the ace that Fife needs to 
get this team over the top. 

As for the rest of the Summit 
League, maybe they were wrong 
after all. In the preseason, this was 
the fifth best conference team and 
it was a shock. Maybe the shock 
was that they were not ranked 
higher. More lime v«II lell better. 
but right now. IPFW has laken a 
stance and there is little doubt left 
thai this team is for real.

Early exit haults volleyball season 

■ Team loses to Oral Roberts in tournament opener, falls short of 20-win season 



The IPFW Mastodons fell in the opening round of 
the Summit League Tournament on November 21. 
falling in four sels to toumameni host Oral Roberts 
3-1 (25-12, 25-22,21-25. 25-23). 

IPFW was led by All-Summit league First 
Team member Rebekah Roehm, who had 17 kills 
and a remarkable .405 attack percentage. Maya 
Schlindwein added 12 kills with an even-better .456 
attack percentage. Schlindwein's attack percentage 
is the fifth highest in the IPFW rally-scoring era 
for a four-sel match, while Roehm's is the I3lh 
highest total. Jessica Miller (eight kills), and Ashley 
Dillon (seven) were third and fourth on the team, 
respcclively, in kills for the 'Dons. Senior lessica 
Dominiak dished out 35 assists, while Dillon had a 
team-best ISdigs.Taryn Parker had five total blocks 
to pace the squad, while Miller had four and Roehm 
and Kylee Hervey had three apiece. 

After finding themselves down early in the first 
two games, IPFW jumped ahead 2-0 in the third set, 
and did not trail at any portion in the frame; leading 
by as many as four at 14-10 in the middle of the set 
after a Jackie Oliviera service error. 

Ahead by four at 19-15, ORU made a run at the 
match win by scoring three straight points to cut 
the deficit to one at 19-18. The lead remained one at 
22-21 before IPFW ran off three straight points, two 
on kills by Dillon and one by Schlindwein. to secure 
a 25-21 third-set victory, sending the match into a 
fourth set. 

The 'Dons Jumped out to a quick 3-1 lead in the 
fourth frame on kills by Schlindwein and T^ryn 
Parker, and a combo block by Miller and Parker. The 
leadwouldbeshonlived:however,asthehoslsscored 
three straight to push ahead to a 4-3 advantage. The 
lead changed hands two more times, most recently 
whun IPFW led 9-8, before a 4-0 ORU run gave the 



Golden Eagles a 12-9. With ORU ahead 18-14. IPFW 
rattled off three consecutive points on a Roehm Idll 
and a pair of Golden Eagle attack errors, cutting the 
deficit to one at 18-17. Oral Roberts pushed ahead 
again, before IPRV clawed back, eventually tying 
the SCI at 22 following a Schlindwein kill, forcing a 
Golden Eagle timeout. The teams traded points and 
were tied again at 23, before ORU scored the final 
two points of the match, the final one on a service 
ace, sending the hosts to the league championship 
match. 

Although the loss eliminated them from any title 
contention and cost them a chance to get to the 
often accomplished 20-win plateau, the team had 
one more match to complete the season. 

Despite a team-high 17 kills from junior Rebekah 
Roehm, the IPFW Mastodons (16-15) fell in their 
season finale to the RedHawks of Miami (20- 1 1 ) by 
a 3-1 SCOTS (25-20. 25-16, 24-26. 25-21) last Friday. 

Roehm tallied 17 kills for the fourth time in her 
final five matches, while also serving up four serves, 
tops in a match this season. Maya Schlindwein 
finished second on the team ^vith eight kills, with 
freshman Ashley Dillon totaling seven. Playing in 
her final match in the Blue and White, setter lessica 
Dominiak dished out 36 assists. Jamie Schwartz 
led the team with 28 digs, with Dillon pulling up 
II. Schlindwein and Kylee Hervey each had seven 
blocks, all assisted, with Jessica Miller and Tkryn 
Parker teaming up with one. 

Megan Griffin led Miami with a game-high 18 kills, 
with Emily Schroeder and Hallie Hanks adding 15 
and 10 kills, respectively 

The loss caps the season for IPFW with a 16-15 
record, their sixth straight season with a winning 
record, and the 29th time in the 32 years of the 
program. 



Ex-Mastodon makes 
strong Mad Ant debut 

He wasn't drafted, nor was he allocated by the NBA 
Developmental League. However, on Friday night 
former Mastodon DeWitt Scott made his professional 
debut with the Fori Wa&gt;'ne Mad Ants. 

Scott made the NBA D-Lcague club in nn 
unconventional way, through tryouts. In Scott's 
first professional game, he was 3-5 from the field, 
including a triple for seven points. He also had three 
rebounds in 23:42 of action.

timeof21:48.2
