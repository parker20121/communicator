issues at the Wednesday, Sept, 9,

The resolution throwing Students' 
Government support behind the Oct. 
26-30 AIDS awareness week, passed 
unanimously with little floor debate. 
Resolution 8788-4, sponsored by Sena- 
tor Barbara Kucharski, labeled AIDS 
an "evergrowing risk" with "no 
known cure" and worried that 
"student knowledge is incomplete and 
not always based on facts". 

Also surfacing in the meeting was 
the question of independence Presi- 



dent Kurt Gregory stated in his report 
that the Chamber of Commerce had 
expressed interest in knowing 
Gregory's views on whether IPF^W 
should break its ties with Indiana and 
Purdue universities. 

However, since no student poll or 
survey had ever been done, Gregory 
proposed a commission to study the 
issue. The panel appointed by Vice- 
President Phil Downs, will have Sena- 
tors Pete Groves, Tim Smith, Tina 
Long, Carol Hildebrand, Robert 
Bishop, Itris Maly and Jeff Pieper as 
members. Independence was also ex- 
pected to be an issue at the Monday, 
Sept, H, Faculty Senate meeting. 
Faculty were also to appoint a 
commiitee lo study the issue. 

Dealing with the state government 



was the topic presented by Legislative 
Affairs Chair Kris Maiy, 

According to Maly, she and Senator 
Tim Smith will attend a legislative 
affairs conference in Indianapolis on 
Saturday, Sept. 19. The conference is 
organized by the lU-Bloomington 
Student Legislative Relations Com- 
mittee, which Maly described as 
"very open" lo ideas from the re- 
gional campuses. Right now Bloom- 
ington is especially interested in 
IPFW student's reviews on raising the 
minimum wage, and controlhng the 
costs of tuition and books, Maly said. 

Turning lo old business, the move to 
grant former dean of Student Ser- 
vices, John Ulmer, a plaque of appre- 
ciation moved one step closer to real- 
ization. Senator Sandra Hadiey, chair

Ehrlich to visit on September 21 



BY GINA JONES 

The Indiana University community 
is planning a two day public celebra- 
tion of higher education in the state 
next month which will culminate In 
the inauguration and special address 
of Indiana University's new president, 
Thomas Ehrlich, 

Specially invited guests include 
representatives of all the colleges and 
universities in Indiana, 

The festivities will begin in In- 
dianapolis on Sunday. Oct. 11, when 
the public will have the opportunity to 
meet President Ehrlich and his wife 
Ellen from 2-3 p.m. in the main foyer 
of the University Conference Center ot 
the Indiana University-Purdue 
University at Indianapolis campus. 

Ehrlich, who is also a professor of 
law at Indiana University, had been 
chief academic officer and professor 
of law at the University of Pennsyl- 
vania since 1982, His career has taken 
him into several professional arenas: 
private law practice, university 
teaching and administration, and 



public service. 

Ehrlich graduated magna cum 
laude from both Harvard College and 
Harvard Law School, receiving his 
law degree In 1959. He then served as 
law clerk for the highly respected 
Judge Learned Hand of the United 
States Court ot Appeals for the Second 
Circuit in New York City. 

In 1960 he entered private law prac- 
tice as an associate with the firm 
Foley, Sammond and Lardner in 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 

He left Milwaukee in 1962 lo become 
special assistant to the legal advisor 
In the U.S. Department of State in 
Washington, D,C. In 1964 he was 
named special assistant to Under 
Secretary of State George W, Ball, 

Ehrlich subsequently taught inter- 
national law at Stanford Law School, 
joining the faculty there in 1965. His 
other main teaching interests were 
contracts and the legal process. 

In 1971 Ehrlich was named dean of 
the Stanford Law School. 

In 1976, under President Gerald 



of the Appropriations Comniltlee, said 
the plaques would cost a ound one 
hundred dollars, Treos .rer Jim 
McCarthy described the sun as no 
strain on the budget and Downs re- 
minded the Senate that Mmer had 
sponsored many galherintJS at his 
house at his own expense The tiody 
moved to authorize Hadiey lo spend no 
more than S125 on the two pnques. 

Lastly, the Senate accepted the pe- 
titions of Terry Granalian, Pete 
Groves, Kim Teter, Carol liildebrand 
and Joy Williamson. The!.' addition 
brings the total to eighteen senators- 
the maximum number permitted by 
the constitution. According to Downs, 
this is the first time "in memory" that 
the Senate has been full. 

Fraternity 
to recruit 

BY DARREN J. WAGGONER 
Managing Editor 

One of the obvious problems of a 
commuter college, such as ours, Is the 
limited opportunity to meet other 
students outside of the classroom. 

There are, however, a few Greek 
organizations on campus, including a 
coed, professional business fraternity. 

Delta Sigma Pi is open to all 
business, pre-business and supervision 
majors. It was started at IPFW in 1976 
but only recently has attention drifted 
its way, 

Delia Sigma Pi members are active 
in the community, including work at 
local hospitals and in the WOWO 
Penny Ktch. Unlike a social frater- 
nity, the setting is very business- 
oriented for members of Di Ita Sigma 
Pi, 

According to Dave Demar -e, former 
president and current secreiary of the 
IV ranked 12 In the nation. See 'ratemity, the group is als.. very ac- 
tive with surrounding chapters 
including those at lU and Purdue. 

Local lawyers, bankers ind oUier 
prominent business people i'(|en come 
in to speak to the group, "We nor- 
mally have one speaker a month and 
someUmes more," said Deniaree. 

The Delta Sigma Pi nal onal con- 
vention was held in New Orleans, 
Sunday, Aug, 16 to Saturday. Aug, 22. 
Based on a point scale, km wn as the 
Chapter Efficiency Indti (CEI), 
IPFW's chapter was prei^ented the 
most improved award, "("ir point 
total rose from 3,000 in 'BS-'i-Ji to 61,500 
in 'B6-'87," said Demaree. 

Demaree hopes more poople will 
look into Delta Sigma Pi. "Not many 
people know about us but we hope to 
increase our membership tnis year." 
he said. 

Delta Sigma Pi will be holding a 
"Meet the Fraternity Nighi ' Friday, 
Sept. 18, in room 224 of the Walb 
Memorial Union Building, beginning 
at7:30p,m. 



Ford, Ehrlich became the first chief 
executive of a new federal organiza- 
tion, the Legal Services Corporation, 
In 1979 Ehrlich Was asked by Presi- 
dent Jimmy Carter lo head another 
new agency, the International De- 
velopment Corporation Agency, 
reporting directly to the president. 

In 1981 Ehrlich left government 
service to become a guest scholar at 
The Brookings Institution. He went to 
the University of Pennsylvania the 
following year. 

Ehrlich holds honorary LL.D. de- 
grees from Notre Dame and Villanova 
universities. 

Ehrlich will spend the day at IPFW 
on Monday, Sept. 21.

Fatalities decreasing but problem still exists 



Drunk driving among the 
15-24 year old age group 
continues to be a tragic 
problem in Indiana and 
throughout the country. 

Though the Governor's 
Task Force' to Reduce 
Drunk Driving has t)een 
able to document successes 
through an increase in Stu- 
dents Against Drunk Driv- 
ing (SADD) chapters to a 
total of 275 statewide and a 
decrease in the percentage 
of alcohol -related fatalities 
this age group still reports 
35% of all alcohol-related 
fatalities while only repre- 
senting 18%' of Indiana's 



driving population. Efforts

drinking and driving to be 
used within Indiana schools. 
This event is the only one of 
its kind in the nation, and 
nearly 700 high school stu- 
dents are expected to 
participate. 

We invite you to join the

Tops of the Pops 

New Pink Floyd not the same without Waters 



"MomeDtary Lapse of 
ReasDB" 
Pink Floyd 
Colombia Records 

Unless you've been living 
under a rock for the last 
few months, I'm sure 
you've heard about the 
controversy going on with 
Pink Floyd. 

Review 

Lead singer /songwriter/ 
bassist Roger Waters is 
suing guitarist David 
GUmour and drummer Nick 



Mason because Pink Floyd 
has broken up and Waters 
does not want to see It re- 
lormed in any way, shape, 
or form. 

Gilmour and Mason, 
along with original key- 
boardist Richard Wright 
have, however, joined again 
and are calling themselves 
Pink Floyd. They have put 
oul an album and are touT' 
ing under this name, much 
to the vehemence of 
Waters. It's really sad, ac- 
tually. Pink Floyd was 
perhaps one of the greatest 
bands in existence, and it is 
truly awful to see things 
come to this. 

Being a fanatical Roger 



Waters affectionado, I must 
admit I was a little skep- 
tical about what the pseudo- 
Pink Floyd would sound 
like, since Waters was not 
there to mastermind the 
recording. And off the bat it 
does sound very much like 
Dave Gilmour solo mate- 
rial. But I love ,Dave 
Gilmour's solo material. 

"Momentary Lapse of 
Reason" is a worthy piece. 
There are many remi- 
niscent sounds and chords 
from earlier Pink Floyd 
songs, mostly from Richard 
Wright's eerie keyboards. 

I particularly like the 
songs "Learning to Fly," 
"The Big Machine; parts I 



and II," and "Dogs of 
War." Some of the songs 
meander a little bit, with 
Gilmour's vocals becoming 
monotonous after awhile, 
but nothing t&gt;ad. 

Gilmour and Mason got a 
lot of help musically, which 
might tie another reason it 
is some very good music. 
Jim Keltner and Carmine 
Appice play drums on some 
tracks, Tony Levin who is 
Peter Gabriel's bassist, 
plays bass, and Jobn 
Hellweil of Supertramp 
plays saxophone. 

Gilmour sings all of the 
vocals, and his voice still 
sounds great, althou^ I 
was hoping (or Wright to

sing one or two songs. The 
guitar work comes out 
forcefully; however, a little 
drab compared to what 
Gilmour is capable of doing. 
The album has t&gt;een very 
well produced, and It 
sounds Incredible on com- 
pact disc. 

There are countless 
numbers of people who pray 
and wish that the four mu- 
sicians who were Pink 
Floyd would settle their 
differences and re-unite 
again. This will almost def- 



initely never happen, but at 
least Waters is producing 
solo material just as good 
as Fink Floyd did when he 
was part of that group. 

We can also be thankful 
for the new Pink Floyd, al- 
though it's not the same. 
Pink Floyd Is coming 
around to this part of the 
country, selling out stadi- 
ums everywhere.

coach Ruth Longardner 
emphasized the team's 
youth by saying, "we 
sometimes fuid ourselves 
playing four TreshmeD and 
two sophomores, so we're 
really young," 

Despite this. Coach 
Longardner and her team 
are looking forward to fac- 
ing the veteran-laden team 
of IPFW. "We have a lot of 
fun when we play IPFW, 
It's really exciting to play 
someone in Fort Wayne that 
is as good as they are. 
Amie has worked hard with 
the program and has a nice 
team. But we're looking to 
playing Ihem because we 
have fun." 

The Dons increased their 
season mark to 5-0 by win- 
ning four matches over the 
weekend cnroute to captur- 
ing the fourth annual IPFW 
Invitational, The. title 
marked the first time that 



an IPFW team captured the 
championship. 

The Dons opened the tour- 
ney by sweeping Hillsdale 
by scores of 15-11, 15-12 and 
15-4. They followed that up 
by beating Oakland Uni- 
versity lS-9, 15-9 and 15-8 in 
Saturday's opening round. 
Ball's team then played the 
first of two matches with 
last year's runner-up. 
Grand Valley State. The 
Dons were forced to play 
five games before putting 
away the visiting Lakers. 
IPFW lost the fir^t two 
games 13-15 and 12-15, be- 
fore rallying to win 15-4, 17- 
15 and 15-6 The same two

onsWp games, with the Voi- 
le vdons prevailing 15-5. 15-5.

Soccer has always played 
a large part in the life of 
hometown star Bronn 
Pfeiffer, 

First, as an AU-City mid- 
fielder at Wayne High 
School and more recently 
here at IPFW, where he 
was team captain last sea- 
son. But this year Pfeiffer 
has abandoned the soccer 
cleats for the clipboard and 
has become the team's new 
coach. 

Pfeiffer, who is still a 
student at IPFW, wanted to 
stay involved in the soccer 
program. When it was con- 
firmed that Jim- Sharp 
would not return as coach 
for the 1987 season, Pfeiffer 
was approached by the 
school's athletic department 
{or the coaching position. 

"I wanted to be involved 
in the program in some 
way." said Pfeiffer, "When 
I decided 1 would be able to 
commit, I took the offer " 

In his last year as a 
player at IPFW, Pfeiffer 



led the Mastodons to second 
place Finish in the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference, 
They advanced to the final 
round of the past season 
tournament, but were de- 
feated by Lewis University. 
2-0 Pfeiffer was named Atl- 
conference after making 
All-Region his first three 
years. 

Despite his interest in the 
game, Pfeiffer did not play 
soccer in an organized 
league until his freshman 
year at Wayae John 
Bierbaum. Wayne's soccer 
coach at the time, placed 
him at the midfield position, 
where he was named All- 
City. 

■'John kept me interested 
in the game and taught me 
the majority of the game I 
know now." said Pfeiffer. 

Following his senior year 
at Wayne, Pfeiffer was re- 
cruited by local colleges 
such as St. Francis and 
Earlham, Dayton Univer- 
sity and Appalacian State 
also made an effort to re- 
cruit him before he com- 
mitted to IPFW- 



Terry Stefankiewicz, tiie 
Mastodon coach, hired 
Bierbaum as an assistant, 
and lured the prize recruit 
to IPFW, Most of Pfelffer's 
schooling was paid for 
through the athletic schol- 
arship he received. 

Now that Pfeiffer has Tm- 
ished his playing days at 
the college level end has 
taken the coaching route, he 
has no regrets about his 
decision to attend a Division 
II school. However, Pfeiffer 
feels soccer does not get the 
proper recognition at IPFW 
and needs stronger crowd 
Following, 

"It (lack of school sup- 
port) has hurt recruiting 
because of the stigma that's 
stuck with us," he said, "If 
we got more attention, we 
could get more kids inter- 
ested in Division I soccer, 
or IPFW, a streng Division 
n program." 

Pfeiffer also feels the 
team needs more "campus 
involvement," as well as a 
larger crowd appeal to get 
more area soccer players 
interested in IPFW,
