IPFW reorganization approved 



By MICHELE R.SHAFFER 

Editor-in-Chief 

With (he approval of the presidents of 

Purdue University and Indiana 

University, Chancellor Thomas 
Wallace announced plans for an 
academic reorganisation of IPFW to 
lake effect July I, 1987. 

I'lie reorganization will group IPF- 
W's academic departments into six 
divisions, each supervised by a 
director. The six divisions are Arts and 
Sciences. Engineering and Technology. 
Fine and Performing Arts, Business 
AdminLslration. Health Sciences and 
Education 

Ihe reorganization plan grew out of a 
request last March from Purdue 
University I^esidenl Steven Beering 
(or IPFW to initiate a study of the 
academic organization of IPFW. With 
his iniLation. and Wallace's direction 
since last July when he look over as 
chancellor, the faculty, departmental 
chairs and Ihe academic officers each 
were directed to come up with plans for 
a new academic structure of IPFW, 
Each group came up with almost 
identical plans that grouped academic 
programs into schools, with a dean at 
the helm of each school. 

"I appreciate very much the great 
deal of lime and effort the faculty spent 
on tliis," Wallace said al a news con- 
ference on Monday 

This plan, which Wallace said„was 
"approved in principle" by the Purdue 
and lU officials, differs from the plan 
approved by the Fort Wayne facully 
senate in their December meeting. 
1'hal plan organized the academic 
departments into schools, each school 



supervised by a dean. The plan ap- 
proved for imple men union calls the 
different units divisions and their 
supervisors directors. The directors of 
the divisions will report to Edward 
Nicholson, vice chancellor and dean of 
faculty. 

Wallace said the plan did not violate 
the management agreement and that it 
would begin next fall, with no effect 
really being tell by the shidents, "This 
IS very clearly, in my judgment, a 
reorganizalion, administratively," 
Wallace said. "We're becoming more of 
a hybrid structure rather than &lt;lwo 
divided structures)." 

Wallace also said it would offer 
students a more liberal arts-based 
education, "I see it definitely as giving 
us a much more aggressive approach to 
the quality of undergraduate life," he 
said. 

"The reorganization plan does not 
change present Indiana University or 
Purdue University policies and 
procedures for faculty personnel 
matters, control of curriculum, or 
financial management," Wallace said 
in a March 16 memorandum distributed 
lo IPFW faculty and staff. 

Under Ihe plan, all academic majors, 
except the Medical School, public and 
environmental affairs and labor studies 
ore repnjsenled In one of the Six 
academic divisions. The Medical 
School, Wallace said, is a statewide 
program that IPFW simply serves as o 
host for; therefore, it will nol be af- 
fected by an IPFW reorganization 

Public and environmental affairs and 
labor studies will be considered 
"units," Wallace said, and will be 



associated with the office of the dean of 
faculty, as they have in the past. The 
recently re-instated HPER (Health, 
Physical Education and Recreation! 
classes will fall under the ad- 
ministration of Ihe division of 



education. The newly-approved 
Masters in Business Administration 
program is an Indiana University 
program, Wallace said, and will be 
regulated by lU policies of budgeting, 
tiiring of facully and other personnel. 




Cultures meet at IPFW 



tnternatlonal Students Organiiatlon hosted II students from Takaoka, Japan on 
March 8. in conjunction with Fort Wayne's Sister City program. Phil Kennell, 
director of International student services: Mary Brant, director of student ac- 
tivities: and a student from Takaoka were among those attending the get- 
together tor Fort Wayne teachers and students and Ihe Takaokan citizens iphotu

Legislature delays budgetary procedures 



BjJOIlNMcGAULEY 
Chief Reporter 

Tuilion costs for the 1987-88 school 
year are unknown al this point in time 
because the State Legislature is having 
problems agreeing on a budget for Ihe 
next fiscal year. According to Jotm 
Carnaghi, vice chancellor for financial 
affairs, the budget package affecting 
the slate's educational system "fell 
apart ' in the state House of 
iteprcscntalives on March 11. 

Wtiile problems with the education 
package. House Bill 1360, do not affect 
tlie State's public colleges, it does delay 
action which will determine how much 
money the stale will contribute to 
higher education next year. 

Carnaghi said Indiana currently 
picks up the bill for 70 percent of IPF- 
W*s operating costs Another five 
percent of operational cosis are 
covered by other sources, such as rent 
from the bookstore and returns on 
university investments. Students 
finance the remaining 25 percent 
Uirough Ihe fees they pay. 

Carnaghi Said a continuing debate 
over the appropriate amount of funding 
for stale colleges has resulted in a 
decline in thai support over the past six 
yers. Despite a nationwide thrust 
toward improved education. Carnaghi 
said "the slate hasn't always kept up its 
end of the deal" when it came lime to 
appropriate money for Indiana's public 
schools. He attributed this fact lo 
declining revenues from parts of the 
stale where the economy is not 
necessarily as strong as in Allen 
County. He also said that the slate must 
be prudent in its spending because of a 
stipulation in the state constitution 
prolnbilmg deficit spending. 

The decline in state funding does 
liavc adverse effects outside of in- 
creased fees lo the student. When the 
university is forced lo fund more of its 
own operation, pay increases for 
facully and staff are decreased or 
eliminated altogether. Carnaghi said 
that such a situation will force "your 
very best people to start looking for a 
new place lo make a livelihood" where 
salaries are more competitive. Such a 
reduction in the caliber of the teaching 
staff will eventually cause "a 
deterioration of what we have In the 
classroom for you," Carnaghi said. 

With al least a monlh lo go before die 
stale finalizes a budget, Carnaghi said 
thai any changes in tuilion costs al 



IPFW would be entirely "driven by 
whatever the stale does," Unless the 
legislature calls a special session lo 
wrap up any unfinished business, the 
budget must be complete l»fore the 
legislature adjourns on April 30, 

In the slate budget, certain assump- 
tions are made regarding the univer- 
sity's ability to support itself and how 
much the slate believes students are 
able to pay. Once a budget is approved. 



il wdl be presented to the Iwo trustee 
groups representing Indiana and 
Purdue Universities, who will accept or 
reject recommendations on student 
tuitioncosls.lf Ihe trustees reject those 
suggestions, Ihe school assumes 
whatever costs student fe«s do not 

A new fee was recently recom- 
mended by IPFW's Facully Senate 
which would reduce the fees paid by 



some sludnets while at the same lime 
increase those paid by others. Referred 
lo as an "academic support fee," the 
new fee would, if proved by Ihe chan- 
cellor, eliminate special lab fees paid 
by some sludenis. However, Ihe fee 
would be paid by all students, whether 
enrolled in a lab course or not. Car- 
naghi was unable lo predict when ac- 
tion might be taken on the new fee, but 
said it would not affect student costs for 
next year.

said. "If we just let il be a firefighter's

"The fire department can't push

"In Sociology 1 learned lo take a big

Something new each day for Ulmer

(Second In a series) 

Spending a day in the life of John 
Ulmcr would probably be physically 
and mentally exhausting lor people half 
his age. but the 56-year-old dean of 
sludent affairs would nol have it any 
other way. 

A typical day lor Ulmcr could likely 
include thirty to forty phone calls. 
meetings with two or three of his 
directors, about _one-half dozen 
meetings with sludenis [scheduled 
appointments and-or drop-ins 1 and 
likely at least one or two committee 
meetings. On the average, Ulmer 
serves on a dozen committees, 

"No day is the same," Ulmer said. 
"There is Ihe diversity and variety of

ble without going through lots and lots of layers."

the job and the challenge of working 
with a student body whose age ranges 
virtually from 14 lo 70. 

"I think il would gel a little boring 
working (as dean of students) on a 
rcsidegtial campus, having typical 
problems of IB- and 2D-year-old students 
lo deal with. 1 specifically chose a 
campus in an urban setting because of 
that variety." 

Ulmer said that a great deal of his 
time, about 50 percent, is devoted to a 
kind of ombudsman's role in dealing 
with students' issues and students' 



concerns. "I've always had the 
philosophy that students have Ihe right 
lo go to the highest source possible 
without going through lots and lots of 
layers," Ulmer said. That is why Ulmer 
chose to have his office in Walb

^Change' to change little 



Chancellor Thomas Wallace 
announced Monday llial officials from 
Purdue University and Indiana 
Universily had approved a 
reorganization plan for the academic 
structure of IPFW. 

With the new plan. IPFW departments 
will be grouped into six divisions: Arts 
and Sciences, Engineering and 
Technology, Fine and Performing Arts, 
Business Administration, Education and 
Health Sciences. Each of those divisions 
will be supervised by a director. 

This plan, "approved in principle" as 
Wallace slated in a news release, is 
significantly different from a plan 
approved by the IPFW faculty senate 
last December The approved plan calls 
for divisions — NOT COLLEGES — of 
study. The new plan, scheduled for 
implementation starting in July, calls 
for directors of the divisions — NOT 
DEANS — of different areas of study. 

Several faculty and students have 
expressed concern and disappointment 
over this, saying this could harm IPFW 
in significant ways. For example, what 
person looking for a position in higher 
education. upon seeing an 
advertisement for a position as director 
of the division of arts and sciences would 
give equal consideration to an available 
position as dean of a college of arts and 
sciences? Probably not many. 

What person would thmk of a division 
of arts and sciences as liaving as much 
prestige as a college of arts and 
sciences'' Probably not many. IPFW has 
grown from a place of education offering 
only two associate's degree programs 
and a handful of faculty to an institution 
of education with over eight buildings, 
many, many baccalaureate and master 
degree programs and numerous 
qualified, nationally-recognized faculty. 
Doesn't IPFW deserve the recognition 
and prestige that would come with being 
organized into colleges of study headed 
by deans? 

Like Wallace said, the substance is the 
same. However, even if the substance is 
the same, the impressions left in 
peoples' minds is significantly different. 
That matters. It matters in student 



recruitment. It matters when it comes to 
recruiting irte best and brightest faculty. 
II matters to faculty retention. 

IPFW is not just a place to attend 
school for a couple years before moving 
on to one of the 'real colleges' in Indiana. 
It is a legitimate institution of higher 
learning with all the respect and 
prestige of its two namesakes. It is timei 
ihe main campuses realize the only way 
it CAN grow, is if it is able to attract thel 
best faculty and students possible. 

Aside from that significant drawback, 
many positive things can be said about 
the reorganization plan. First of all, it 
marks Wallace's first major 
achievement. The fact that he was able 
to direct and lead such a major 
undertaking, having it completed and 
approved in less than a year, says a lot 
about his leadership and abilities. 

Another benefit is that the 
reorganization leaves room open for the 
Purdue and lU faculty at IPFW to begin 
working together more. As Wallace toid 
a group of reporters at a news 
conference Monday, the reorganization 
plan will bring more of a "hybrid" 
atmosphere at IPFW No longer will 
IPFW be divided into "Indiana courses 
of study" and "Purdue courses of 
study." The two will, in some cases, be 
combined into one division. For 
example, the division of arts and 
sciences includes classes like chemistry 
and English, One is an offspring of 
Purdue curriculum and the other is an 
offspring of an Indiana curriculum. 
Under the new plan, faculty will be 
housed in one division, forcing them to 
work together for the students they are 
charged with educating. 

Despite the opinions of several faculty. 
the reorganization plan is probably the 
best thing to happen to IPFW in a long 
time. It is a streamlining that will 
benefit students and faculty in the long 
run. It is a step toward an improved 
IPFW. Just think though, of what we 
could do if we had FULL cooperation of 
both administrations for other projects 
we would like to implement at this 
campus.

Smokers now beware Senate Bill 145: Little 

impact oii Indiana yoiith 



• Thanks to a document created by a 
subcommitee tor Ihe University 
■Resource Policy Committee iURPC) 
■students and faculty may soon be seeing 
needed changes in campus smoking 
t)olicies. The document was presented to 
URPC Monday morning for review, and 
calls for smoking only in specially 
designated areas on campus 

IPFW currently has a "no-smoking 
policy tor classrooms, laboratories and 
some designated corridors. However, 
these rules are not strongly enforced and 
often ignored by students and faculty 
alike. This laissez-faire altitude is 
causing problems. First, non-smokers' 
rights are being infringed upon when 
someone lights up a cigarette in an area 
that is blatantly posted as "NO 
SMOKING," This is especially upsetting 
when professors walk in a classroom and 
light up, standing within inches of a no- 
smokingsign. Also, it is more than a non- 
ismoker should have to endure to walk 
into a restroom and be greeted by clouds 
of unpleasant smoke. 
: While smokers should have their 
rights too, it is only out of respect that 
they should adhere to campus smoking 
policies. Today, when so much research 
points to the life threatening results of 
smoking, it seems only fair that a 
smoker shouldn't infringe on his non- 
smoking neighbors' rights. 

The above mentioned document would 
not only reinforce old policies, but also 



create new standards "prohibiting 
infringement of non-smokers rights in 
certain areas, while making smoking 
acceptable in other areas of campus. 

According to the six-part document, 
smoking would be banned in offices, 
restrooms, meeting rooms, hallways, 
classrooms and laboratories, but would 
provide for designated smoking areas in 
selected buildings. 

The multi-purpose building and the 
animal care facihty would be declared 
non-smoking buildings. The classroom- 
medical building is also being 
considered as a third non-smoking area. 

The fourth section of the document 
calls for removal of all ashtrays except 
those in designated smoking areas and 
the fifth section states that all employees 
and students should be informed of the 
policy and no-smoking signs should be 
posted where the no-smoking rule is in 
effect. 

Finally, the document would require 
the smoking ban to be enforced by IPFW 
police with support and cooperation 
from students and employees. 

Although smokers may think the new 
proposal is simply trying to limit their 
rights maybe those same people should 
consider the rights of others too. Not 
only IS it rude to disregard smoking 
policies, but it is also unfair to smoke 
around others who are concerned about 
their health. 



Onl'uesday, March 10. the 
Indiana Senate approved a 
new bill that would raise the 
legal purchasing age ol all 
tobacco products to 
eighteen. The current legal 
age is sixteen 

Commentary 

Senate Bill 145 was ap- 
proved 38-11, The bill not 
only includes cigarelles, ahd 
cigars, but chewing tobacco 
and snuff. The inclusion of 
chewing tobacco and snilff 
would curb Ihe sale of these 
Items to the younger 
teenagers — who, unab'le 
because of age to purchase 



cigarettes or cigars, pur- 
chase the chewing products. 
The smokeless tobacco is 
linked to throat and mouth 

At this moment the bill 
calls lor the seller of tobacco 
products to anyone under 
sbctccn to be fined up to sm 
dollars The bill does not 
have a provision to fine or 
penalize (he purchasers in 
any way. 

II IS our recommendation 
thai the bill have a 
■'delinquency" penalty 
added, fining minors that 
purchase the illegal tobacco 
substances, if the bill is to 



have any impact on tlie 
children ol this slate, it must 
carry a more substantial 
threat. The bill should take 
into consideration that a 
minor found with liquor is 
considered a "dehnquent." 
The liquor is not only illegal 
to purchase but also to 
consume or have in one's 
possession if under age. 

The toltacco law should 
have a provision which 
would make Ihe use of 
lobaceo by minors illegal. If 
(hebillispassedas it stands, 
minors under age 18 would 
be able to use the products, 
as long as they are not 
caughl purchasing il. 



Women who are affected 
by tlus idea may consider it a 
good thing. They will feel 
more control and safety 
from disease and pregnancy. 
Some women from a 
generation where sex was a 
dirty word may be disgusted 
and offended by the idea of 
women providing men with 
condoms. This is un- 
derstandable, however, 
times are different and we 
arc looking at potential 
death as well as potential 
life 

Convincing women of 
these facts and making these 
ideas about condoms ac- 



eplable to society may be 
difficult, but approaching 
men with this may be 
challenging and discom- 
forting. 

Men's attitudes are 
evolving but women 
providing condoms is not 
exactly "traditional" and 
men may not agree wilh this 
action This could be a power 
struggle issue as well as an 
issue of life and death 

Protection from sexually 
transmitted diseases is an 
issue wliich must be con- 
"Tronfed 5y society. There 
were approximately 27,000 
cases of AIDS diagnosed as' 
of November. 1986 in the 
UnitedStates; lS,000ormore 
ol these men, women and 
children are now dead.

Want to have a love affair with 
a plastic mannequin? Why not! 



By NATALIE ALCOX 
Feature Editar 

■■Mannequin" is a lighl- 
heartcd comedy about a 
young man and his devotion 
lo inspiraljon. 



Review 



Johnathoi 



Swjl 



I Mc- 



carty) searching for an 

inspirational career. By 

. mere chance he lands a job 

. at the Prince Co., an equally 

' downtrodden department 

store. Then, ot course, our 

; hero falls in love. There's 

■ one catch however, she's a 

; mannequin in the store 

' window. One would think 

' that this would make a love 

allair highly unlikely, if not 

impossible Through some 

whim of the gods this 

: mannequin, Emmie, comes 

alive at night. Hurray!!! 



Now we can really start 
watching the movie. 

If you can accept the basic 
premise the move is based 
on, love amongst plastics 
and people, it's a great 
romantic comedy. The 
romance flows evenly and 
naturally. Just when you're 
thinking "O.K. things look 
loo perfect, something's 
going to happen" — 
something docs. 

The only serious flaw this 
movie has is the lack of 
detail in some parts. 
Although you find out how 
Emmie gets lo Prince 
Co. and meets Switzer, you 
never find out what makes 
her so special — that the 
gods or fate or whoever is 
twhmd the camera to allow 
her to come alive at night. 
Also, what makes Switzer so 
special that he deserves the 
. . mannequin? 

The other characters add 



lo the humor of the movie. 
Especially Switier's friend, 
Hollywood. Hollywood is a 
v/indow dresser at Prince 
Co. and is having his own 
love affair with a guy named 
Albert, 

Swi tier's ex -girlfriend, 
floxy. also plays an active 
role as the movie unfolds. 

Fortunately, the ending 
suits the rest of the movie. 
Although It's predictable, it 
is a happy ending. 

All in all "Mannequin" 
was a good movie if it is 
taken in the spirit in which it 
was intended. If you're 
looking for blood and gore 
and action, wait for the next 
Etambo movie. If, however, 
you are looking for a comedy 
in which the characters are 
believable, "Mannequin" is 
for you and the kids. It is 
rated PG and is playing at 
Southtown Theatres.

Healthy tan is easily available 



BylLENESMITH 

Staff Writer 
What is better lookmg than 

; alan? A dark Ian, ot course. 
For those who live in the 

: sunny south, getting a tan 

can be a year long process. 

In the rest of the country, 

there is cold and snow to 

' contend with. Thus, for those 
of us who can't afford to 
spend the winter in Florida, 
a healthy tan is restricted to 
the summer months of the 
year A solution to this UO' 
fortunate fact of Northern 
life has been found. II is the 



tanning salon. 

Going to a tanning salon 
may be a new experience for, 
many. One of the first 
questions first-lime visitors 
liave is how damaging is 
indoor tanning to the skin? 
Becky Miller of Studio II 
Hair Design's tanning room 
explained that il is actually 
safer Ihan tanning by the 
sun. Sunlight is made up of 



al diffe 



ent 



wavelengths of light. Some 
of these cause lanning, and 
others cause sunburn. The 
lights used for indoor tan- 



ning do nut give off the 
burning wavelengths. 

People also want to know 
what precautions they 
should fallow in salon tan- 
ning. Lisa Bryer of the 
Tanfashion tanning salon 
offered some lips. First, 
always wear eye protection. 
Although Ihe lights used in 
lanning beds may cause the 
skin lo burn, they are intense 
enough to damage one's 
eyesight Goggles should be 
available at the salon. 
Another safety tip is to 
gradually build up a tan. 



This is particularly im- 
portant for people with fair 
skin. Initial lanning sessions 
may only be 15 or 20 minutes, 
but once a base tan has been 
established, more lime can 
be spent in a session. 

A final lip that Byers of- 
fers tanners is to use 
moisturizers. Many Unning 
products are suitable for 
this Accelerating lotions are 
particularly good. Not only 
do they moisturize the skin, 
but also speed up the skin's 
own tanning process, without 
the use of dyes and bronzers. 



Psychedelic Furs straddle fine line 
between commercialism, originality 



ByDAVEWISNER 
Staff Writer 
"MIDNIGHT TO MID- 
NIGHT," The Psychedelic 
Furs. 



Review 



On the road lo success and 
fame, many bands walk the 
thin wire separating unique. 
original music and com- 
: mercialized, one-sound-fits- 
I all music, usually plunging 
way into the latter side to 
reach their stardom. Every 



once and awhile, along 
comes a band that has their 
own sound, and they still 
become popular. 

The Psychedelic Furs 
have walked that wire, and 
have straddled bolh sides. 
They have patented their 
own sound, easily itentified 
by Richard Butler's raspy, 
sighing voice and the 
somewhat dreamy quality of 
their music. Looking back at 
the previous Furs albums, 
this sound has always been 



•MIDNIGHT TO MID- 
NIGHT^' IS their moat 
commercially palatable 
album to date, but they 
haven't sold out yet. 

The band still features 
Richard Butler on vocals. 
John Ashton on guitars, and 
I'lm Butler on bass. Side one 
starts off mellow, with 
■'Heartbreak Beat, ■' picks up 
somewhat, and then ends 



with a syrupy ditty called 
"Angels Don't Cry." On side 
two the pace quickens, and 
they rock a lilUe more, "One 
Moffi Word" and" "Torture" 
stand out as the really good 
songs on this one. 

"Forever Now" and "Talk 
Talk Talk" are the best 
products by this band, 
although this is decent work, 
and I did like the horns, 
played by Mars Williams.

Here's a good stuff offer from Wend/s" 



Russeirs contract not renewed; Calahan resigns 




B.\ JOllNMtGAULEY 
Chief Itcpnrlcr 
A sudden and unexpected 
turn ol events has led lo the 
firing of TPFW's men's 
hnskclball coiicli 1'im 
Itussell and the resignation 
of women's L-03i.'h Julie 
Calahan. 

The unexpected staff 
changes first eame to tight 
last week in a press release 
from the alhletic dcpart- 
mcnl. The short, four-line 
announcement released 
Mareli 1 1 said only thai "Tim 
Russell's conlrael as he^d 
men's basketball coach 
would not be renewed (or the 
1907-88 school year," The 
announcement gave no 
explanation (or (iussell's 
firing, saying only thai the 
"search (or a new coach will 
l)cgin immediately " 

When readied at hurne 
^undav evening. Kussell's 
only comment before 
abruplly ending the con- 



I don't \ 
10 talk to you now. I have no 
comment," 

Russell will reportedly 
remain on Uie payroll until 
next month. His plans a(ter 
leaving IPFW are not 
known. 

Since coming aboard for 
llie 1982-03 season, Russell 
skippered the Mastodons to 
an overall record of 67-72, his 
best season coming in 1983- 
(M. with a record of 18-10. The 
team had a disappointing 
season this year, with an 
overall record of 9-19 and 3- 
13 in the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference, one possible 
factor in'his dismissal. 

Arnie Ball, athletic 
director and coach o( the 
men's volleyball team, made 
llie decision to terminate 
Russell's (.'onlraci. Ball, who 
became athletic director on 
I-'eb 1. re(used to say why 
Hussell was being let go, 
saying that information to tie 



"confidential." One report 
said that Russell and Ball 
had a disagreement, in- 
volving funding for iPFWs 
individual teams. When 
questioned on (he unequal 
distribution of funding to 
athletic teams on campus. 
Ball refused comment, 
saying tliat it would only 
"open up a can of worms I 
don't care to get into," An 
insider in the athletic 
department claims that, 
percentage- wise, the men's 
basketball team receives 
more money than the men's 
volleyball team. 

Ball said that the process 
for locating a new coach has 
already begun, and the exact 
structure of the search will 
be announced next week. He 
uLso said that the search- 
and-screen committee would 
begin interviewing possible 
candidates by April 1. 

Ball added that the 
assistant coach (or the men's 



team. C C Fullove, is ort the 
athletic deparlmenl's full- 
time staff and will be 
retained, although his status 
as assistant coach will be 
decided by the incoming 
head coach. 

Julie Calahan, the 
women's head coach, said 
Monday that her resignation 
is in no way lied to the firing 
of Russell. In fact, she said 
that her emminent depar- 
ture was known of by her 
assistants and players two 
weeks before it was an- 
nounced publicly. According 
to Calahan. she expressed an 
interest in leaving midway 
through the season, which 
ended February 28, but was 
asked by Ball to reconsider. 

Calahan feels that she is 
leaving on a positive note. 
saying that "1 am still very 
supportive of (IPFWi and 
the people " She expressed 
pride in the improvements 
made in player recruiting 



sinceshe became head coach 
two years ago. In the past, 
she said that no com- 
prehensive list of potential 
recruits was available. Now. 
future coaches have a 
computer listing o( high 
school juniors and seniors 
that may be valuable 
recruits for (he basketball 
program. 

On the subject of Russell's 
Tiring, Calahan said "I was 
surprised. I really had no 
idea the was being fired)." 
She continued "it wasn't just 
one particular situation" 
that led to his dismissal. 
"They (the athte[ic depart- 
ment) just (elt there needed 
(0 be a change, " Calahan 

Due to the impending 
signing of new players on 
April 8, C:alahan said that it 
is imperative that 
replacements tor Russell 
and herself t&gt;e found soon. 
"I'd be lying if I say it won't

Springob How did Coach 



Ball find Springob? "He 
probably knew me from the 
Junior Olympics in Chicago 
last summer," Springob 
said. "Maybe also because I 
played Sports Festival. A

for the rest o( the season: "1
