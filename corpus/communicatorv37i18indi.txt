Indiana University- Purdue 
University Police and Safety 
will be holding Rape Aggres- 
sion Defense (RAD) classes 
throughout the month of Feb- 
ruary in order to better educate 
and protect the school's female 
students and faculty. 

The classes will be held in 
Walb Union on Feb. 5, 12, 19 
and 26 from 6:00 p.m. until 
9:00 p.m. and are intended to 
teach women basic self-de- 
fense tactics in the event that 
they are in an uncomfortable or 
dangerous situation. 

Though there were no report- 
ed rapes last year on the IPFW 
campus, there were 44 reported 
rapes in the Fort Wayne area, 
and IPFW Police and Safety 
are doing their best to make 
sure that female students are 
protected. 

The classes are intended "to 
develop and enhance the op- 
tions of self-defense so they 
may become viable consid- 
erations to the woman who 



The RAD class is a 12-hour 
instructional course, spread out 
over four evenings, and begins 
with awareness, prevention, 
risk reduction and risk avoid- 
ance, and then progressing to 
hands-on defense training ba- 
sics. On the last evening of 
class, there will be a simulated 
attack situation and students 
are encouraged to participate. 

Students who complete RAD 
classes are offered a free life- 
time return and practice policy 
once they have graduated from 
the course and incase they feel 
a future need to brush up on 
their skills. 

"I would be willing to consid- 
er taking the RAD class since 
it's offered, but I don't think I 
would ever seek it out myself," 
said junior Amanda Parrish. 

According to a survey com- 
pleted by recent IPFW RAD 
graduates, they experienced 
significant increases in confi- 
dence in many scenarios, in- 
cluding being alone in public

places, beint: alone at work and 
home, and in their ability to de- 
fend ihemselves. 

"1 think I would feel safer 
afterwards because the class 
would teach me how to ward 
off attackers and to know what 
to do and how to react if I was 
in a dangerous situation," said 
Parrish. 

The RAD class is open to 



women, and is free to IPFW 
faculty, staff, students, alumni 
and the spouses and dependent 
children of IPFW staff. . 

Those women who are unaf- 
filiated with the school but still 
are interested in the Rape Ag- 
gression Defense course will 
be charged $25 for the class.

Just in time for Valentine's 
Day, IPFW students are en- 
couraged to join the rest of the 
nation in wearing red on Fri., 
Feb. 2. 

The American Heart Asso- 
ciation.^ "Go Red Day" is an 
annual event intended to cel- 
ebrate and raise awareness for 
women's heart health. 

Those interested can check 
out the lower level of Kettler 
Hal! this Friday from 1 1 a.m. to 
1 p.m. Students who stop by 
the "Go Red" information table 
will be offered free blood pres- 
sure screenings and be given 
the opportunity to ask questions 
about cardiovascular health. 

Heart disease is the leading 
cause of death for women and 
men, taking more lives than the 
next four causes of death com- 
bined. According to the Amer- 
ican Heart Association, car- 
diovascular diseases kill over 
480,000 women every year. 
That is roughly one per min- 
ute, and despite these statistics, 
only 13 percent of women view 
bean disease as a threat to their

health. 

IPFW has been "going red" 
for the past several years ac- 
cording to April Parks, a 
nurse-practitioner at the IPFW/ 
Parkview Health and Wellness 
Clinic. Along with the IPFW 
Department of Athletics Rec- 
reation and Intramural Sports, 
the clinic will serve as a spon- 
sor of the event. 
"We very much observe it ev- 
ery year," Parks said. "There 
are lots of women on this cam- 
pus. It's a good eye opener." 



Parks also said that many 
women believe they should 
be more concerned about their 
risk for breast cancer than their 
potential for cardiovascular 

In reality, among the female 
population, one in 2.6 deaths 
are from heart problems, while 
one in 30 die from breast can- 
cer. In particular, strokes arc 
of major concern. 
"Strokes are one of the things 
women need to be aware of,"

The Indiana University - 
Purdue University Police and 
Safety department provides 
more services than just writing 
parking tickets. They also of- 
fer services to students in need 
of assistance on campus. 

"We do escorts, vehicle un- 
locks, jump starts and just all- 
around patrol of campus to en- 
sure the safety of students and 
staff." said Lieutenant William 
Daugherty of Police and Safe- 
ty- 
Anyone on campus can rely 
on the police to help them feel 
comfortable and safe. "Anyone 
who feels uneasy about their 
area may call for an escort any- 
time day or night," said Daugh- 
erty. The police are there to 
serve those on the campus, but 
there are things that students 
and faculty can do to ensure 
their own safety. "Anything 
that a person can learn to help 
protect themselves is always 
useful," said Daugherty.

Parks said, adding thai 
ihey kill more women 
(han men. 

Fortunately, knowledge 
and awareness can make 
a difference in women's 
heart health. 

"There arc things you 
can do to help lower your 
risk of cardiovascular dis- 
ease," Parks explained. 

Controllable causes of 
heart disease include: 
high blood pressure, 
smoking, high cholester- 
ol, obesity, physical inac- 
tivity and diabetes. 

Parks emphasizes the 
importance of monitoring 
caffeine and salt intake as 
well. She recommends 
daily exercise in addition 
to thirty minutes or more 
of physical activity at 
least five times a week. 



Parks encourages stu- 
dents with any questions 
or concerns about their 
heart health, or their 
health in general, to stop 
by the Health and Well- 
ness Clinic, located in 
Room 234 of Walb Stu- 
dent Union. The clinic 
is open from 8 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Monday through 
Thursday, and from 8 
a.m. to noon on Fridays. 



physical exams are avail- 
able for a fee. Staffed 
with two nationally certi- 
fied nurse-practitioners, 
two collaborating phy- 
sicians and a certified 
medical assistant, the 
clinic accepts patients 
on a walk-in basis or by 
appointment. For more

said the lieutenant. Yet 
if there is a case where a 
student or faculty mem- 
ber may have overlooked 
something the Police 
and Safety department is 
there to help. 

Students also need 
to be aware of the blue 
lighted safety poles 
around campus that im- 
mediately alert Police 
and Safety. Although 



are not as disturbing as 
"simple theft. Books and 
book bags," said Daugh- 

LieutenantDaughertyalso 
provided some news that 
can be considered good 
or bad, depending on the 
perspective. "Crime rate 
on campus stays about 
the same from year-to- 
year," said Daughterly. 
Overall, crime is not get- 
ting &lt; 



, but i 



getting noticeably better. 

Students need not be 
shy in asking for help, 
and if the police depart- 
ment cannot provide a 
needed service, the po- 
lice can assist in finding 
that help. 

With theft being the 
most common campus 
crime, students are en- 
couraged to pay attention 
to bathroom signs that 
wam not to leave items 
unattended, as there are 
reasons for these signs. 
If something is lost or 



stolen. 1PFW is not re- 
sponsible. 

The IPFW Police and the 
safety they provide is a 
service to those on cam- 
pus. To seek information 
for personal use, students 
can select the Police and 
Safety link on the IPFW 
homepage, or stop by 
the office in the Physi- 
cal Plant located behind 
that Classroom Medical 
building.

ihe current president will not be able 
to run for office as he has served two 
terms. This being the case, many are 
wondering who will run. It seems 
so far there has been more media in- 
lerest in who will be running for the 
democratic seat. 

The two potential democratic can- 
didates that have received the most 
media attention are Hillary Clinton 
and Barack Obama. If either ran and 
were elected for the 



and then won Ihe position of Presi- 
dent, their roll would be ground- 
breaking. 

On many news and talk show pro- 
grams two questions have been re- 
peatedly asked. The first being: "Are 
we ready for a female Presidcm'" 
and the second being: 'Arc we ready 
for an African American president .'" 
I find the fact that people are even 
asking these questions lo be ridicu- 
lous. Is this country so close minded 
to having someone, who isn't an old- 
er white male leading this country? 
Are those people not aware of the 
efunges dial are happening in this 
country, and more importantly the 
changes ihal still need lo be made? 

I am not saying that Clinton or 
Obama are the perfect individuals 



for ihe job, but I a

Many say that Clinton is a mis- 
lake because she is a former hrsi 
lady. This could be true. On the olher 
hand, a person could look al her and 
think she would have a strong sup- 
port syslcm behind her. 

Most individuals who are against 
Clinton were most likely in the past 
for Bush. Yel why were (hey nol con-

Shyamalan's 'Lady in the Water' 
sinks to the bottom of new releases 



By Mike Webb 

Arts &amp; Entertainment Editor 



Ever since 1999s "'The Sixth Sense" I have 
been a fan of writer/director M. Night Shyama- 
lan's work. Though often criticized for relying 
loo much on plot twists in order to create buzz 
about what many consider me- 
diocre work, Shyamalan con- 
tinues to make films the way 
he wants to make them. This 
approach has yielded what I 
call a "Shyamalanian vibe," as 
his approach to filmmaking is 
distinct and recognizable. 

Perhaps it's due to my 
own lack of expertise when 
it comes to filmmaking, but 1 
have enjoyed all that I have 
seen of Mr. Shyamalan's work. 
He has consistently taken an 
almost relatable world and 
dropped ihe supernatural into 
the center of it in a way that is 
reminiscent of a modem day 
fairy tale •- often a scary fai- 

lt is for that reason that I 
fully expected to enjoy "Lady 
in the Water." Of all his mov- 
ies, this one appeared to be the 
most whimsical and fun. 

As much as it pains mc 
to admit, I finally find myself 
on the other side of the fence 
when il comes to this film. I 
just didn't find the movie en-

Mitchell's voice is shocking in 
the fact that it is so ordinary and yei 
so honest. At first, her voice didn't 
appeal to me. It is high pitched and 
childlike. 

It sounds similar to Leigh Nash

less polished.

Her voice sounds touchable to the
