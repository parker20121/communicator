By Dan Jehl 



The first campaign

ycarbya Republican can- 
didate in the prcsidentia] 
elcclion took place. 

In Marcli, former 
President Bill Jefferson 
Clinton, campaigning 
for Sen. Hilary Clinton 
(Dem) drew 5,000 to the 
Grand Wayne Center. 
Later, the entire Obama 
family drew the same at 
Headwaters Park, but 
Sarah Palin topped them 
both combined at the Al-

a Saturday night, Oclo-.

Washington Post's Eugene Robinson 



"This (election) favors 
Obama for not jusl a vic- 
tory but a tsunami-type 
Wclory for Obama," stat- 
ed Washington Post's Eu- 
gene Robinson ai IPfWs 
Omnibus Lecture on 
October 21. Robinson, a 
33-year veteran political 
journalisi, gave his spin 
on the presidential elec- 
tion at IPBV's John and 
Ruth Rhinchart Music 
Center. 

Robinson is an asso- 
ciate editor and twice- 
weekly columnist forThe 
Washington Post. His 
column is carried by The 



Fort Wayne fournal Ga- 
zette. He has authored 
Coal to Cream: A Black 
Man's loumey Beyond 
Color to an Affirma- 
tion of Race (1999) and 
Last Dance in Havana 
(2004). Robinson is a 
frequent guest on MSN- 
BC as a political analyst 
for Race for (he While 
House, Countdown 
with Keith Olbermann, 
and Hardball with Chris 
Matthews. 

Robinson gave a free- 
wheeling insightful 
tale of the 2008 elec- 
tion. He reminded the 
1.500-strong audience 
that at the beginning of 
2008, the two leading 
presidential candidates 



among ihe 15 in con- 
tention were Sen. Hilary 
Clinton (Dem) and for- 
mer Mayor of New York 
Rudy Gulliani (Rep). 

Things changed. 

Obama won the Iowa 
caucuses and proved he 
could win. Gulliani fad- 
ed under public scrutiny. 
McCain started winning 
Ihe primaries. 

Robinson criticized 
both candidates. Sen. 
Barack Obama (Dem) 
and Sen. John McCain 
(Rep), for how they han- 
dled the recent economic 
bailout in Congress and 
how they are not pro- 
posing specifics with the 
economic issues today. 

He argues the economy 



is the 'paramount issue" 
and that it shapes the 'is- 
sue landscape." 

Robinson echoed re- 
marks from his Oct. 11 
"Talk About the Melt- 
down" piece in The 
Washington Post where 
he bluntly wrote: "I'd like 
to know how the presi- 
dential candidates view 
this economic crisis, and 
I don't want any boiler- 
plate about how Ameri- 
can workers are the best 
in the world. Is this a 
temporary setback or a 
fundamental shift?" 

He also said: "Sen. 
Obama? Sen. McCain? 
Reassure me. Don't give 
me empty words about 
American exception- 



alism. Tbll me in plain 
language what our new 
place is In the world and 
how we're going (o give 
our children the good life 
that we've enjoyed." 

At IPFW. Robinson or 
gucd that the economic 
climate favors Obama. 
He explained when the 
economy sours, incum- 
bents arc at risk, and 
people favor change. 

Robinson made his pre- 
diction. 

'I am saying that a black 
man, Barack Hussein 
Obama, is favored to win 
and will be the President 
of Ihe United Slates," 
said Robinson. 'Hold on 
to your seats, it's going to 
be a bumpy ride." 




Here are some Eu- 
gent- Robinson-isms- 
- inicrcsbng and in- 
sightful points mostly 
on election-related 
subjects, 

• On graduating from 
the Uniwrsity of Mich- 
igan and their football 
team. "We're heading a 
certain direction, but it 
seems (o be (he wrong 
one." 

• On caricalureit of 
the candidates, "Voters 
have a choice between 
a young Sidney Poilier 
or a Don Rickles on a 
bad night." 

• On the value of 
money, money is "what 
we laughingly refer to 
as our money." 

• On the 2008 elec- 
tion. "This is ihc dam- 
mdesi presidenlial 
election I have ever 
seen. It is the most 
surprising, most excit- 
ing, and most historic. 
And we haven't even 
voted yet-' 

• On the importance 
of this election, 'The 
stakes in this election 
are incredibly high.* 
And the slakes are get- 
ting higher.' 

• On the election be- 
ing a referendum for 
America. "This is a ref- 
erendum. It's a referen- 
dum on Barack Obama 
and John McCain and 
which one can get tis 
through this crisis,' 

• On negative cam- 
paigning, "In the short 
run, it may work but 
not really in the long 
run. People are not in 
(he mood. to talk about 
ancient history." 

• On John McCain, "I 
actually like John Mc- 
Cain.'. 

■ On Barack Obama, 
"I don't think of him as 
all that liberal myself" 

• Is Sarah Palin quali- 
fied to step in as Presi- 
denl? Robinson: "No." 

• Is race a factor in 
this election? Rob- 
inson said: "Race is a 
factor in the election, 
mostly already taken 
into account. It's most- 
ly already factored in." 

• What is the most 
important number in 
this election? Robin- 
son said: "The most 
imponam single num- 
ber in this election is 
80 and now 85% of 
Americans who think 
the country is on the 
ivrong track.' 

• On his father and 
an African -American 
presidential candidate, 
"My fathet bom in 
1916. is alive today It 
is incredible lo me that 
he is alive to see a black 
man not only running 
for presideni but also 
probably winning it.'

Contributing to something bigger than yourself 




By KodyTinnei 

Sludtnl Body President 



Last Saturday, I took 
advantage of early vot- 
ing and cast my ballot 
for the 2008 genera! elec- 
tion. 1 won't go into de- 
tail about who exactly I 
voted for. although one 
could pretty easily guess 
by looking at the decora- 
tions on my office door. 
This was the first time I 
was able to vote in a na- 



tional election and I was 
very happy to be part of 
such an exciting political 
year. 

Voting is something 
I take very seriously, 
which seems to make 
sense because I am a 
Public Affairs major and 
the Student Body Presi- 
dent. But for me voting 
is more than just choos- 
ing our elected officials 
every few years. Voting 
is an act that creates a 
sense of community. It 



brings people together 
despite political or ideo- 
logical differences. By 
casting your ballot you 
are approving a system 
of government designed 
to better the lives of the 
people through demo- 
cradc elections and a 
strong belief in liberty. 

People often claim 
that their one vote isn't 
going to make a differ- 
ence, but when several 
million other people 
have that same attitude 



it will greatly affect the 
outcomes. By not voting, 
you are passing on our 
basic ideals and show- 
ing others that you are 
loo apathetic to contrib- 
ute to something bigger 
than yourself. While ease 
of voting could be in- 
creased, the act is not all 
that challenging by most 
standards. 

This year, on the first 
Tljesday after the first 
Monday in November, 
be sure to make your 



voice heard. T^e pride 
in exercising your right, 
responsibility, and privi- 
lege to cast your vote. 
Show love for your fellow 
men and women by do- 
ing your part in our gov- 
ernment. 



Encouraging the young voter, 



By Craig Lloyd 



Vl'e've all heand that 
young people need to 
vote. We've seen cam- 
paigns like MTV's 
"Choose or Lose" and 
Rock the Vote aimed at 
tlie people of youth. Why 
exactly are all these orga- 
nizations and different 
campaigns encouraging 
the youth to vote? The 
answers are simple. 

Where do you 
think the candidates are 
targeting their advertis- 
ing dollars and public 
relation efforts? They 
want to target tl\e group 
of citizens that bring in 
tlie most votes, and that 
group of citizens is not 
the j^outh, it's tlie older 
folks. According to the 
U.S. Census Bureau in 
2004, only -17% of 18- to 
24-year-olds showed up 
at the polls compared to 
the 64% of older citizens. 
That's right; the youth are 



being left out of the can- 
didates' campaign plans 
and ideas. 

The biggest is- 
sues of the economy often 
effect the youth. The war 
in Iraq is one example- 
More and more young 
soldiers arc being sent 
overseas. Education is 
another example. Tbition 
fees for college students 
are ever more increas- 
ing. Tiiese are just some 
of the hot topics that ef- 
fect the youth directly. 
These issues are the big- 
gest pan of an election. If 
you don't ^-ote, you throw 
away your ability to have 
any say in these issues 
that affect YOU. 

A big reason most 
youth (and even the old- 
er folks) do not vote is 
because they think their 
vote does not matter. 
The realitv' is. even' \iDie 
counts. Does Florida 
ring a bell? In the 2000 
presidential election. 
Florida was the deciding 
factor in who would be 



right to complain, ple^ 
vote. 



OpEd 
the next president. The down to an art form. So if 
votes were so close that youiranttoexerciseyour 
numerous recounts were 
demanded. Finally, a 5 to 
4 Supreme Court deci- 
sion ended the recount 
of Florida's votes, allow- 
ing Florida to certify its 
electoral vote. You might 
think that your vote 
is nothing but a small 
campfire in the middle 
of a gigantic forest, but 
when your vote is com- 
bined with those voters 
that share the same opin- 
ions and views as you, 
your campfire becomes a 
forest fire of destruction. 
Lookout! 

ffyou don't vote, 
you have no right to com- 
plain about the govern- 
ment. Not voting is sim- 
ply not caring ho^v your 
coimtry is run. So if you 
don't care, why would 
you complain when the 
government does some- 
thing that you don't 
tike? If i'ou're like most 
young people, you enjoy 
complaining and hare it 





Just in case the 
"I'm starting an 
online company" 

idea doesn't pan out. 

Nov/ is a perfect time to take the GRE 
Test for grad school. Your scores are good 
for 5 years— giving you plenty of tin— '- 
try a few things first. Think of it as h 
an insurance policy for your future.

Your Freedumb to Vote 



By Doug Schmidt 

Maglcim EruaordlruliF 



While the "youth 
vote" has grown signifi- 
cantly, some of you are 
planning to spend Super 
Tuesday playing Wii un- 
til your arm feels like it's 
made of pudding. But, 
remember, democracy' 
is the fuel that keeps the 
Indy 500 of freedom roll- 
ing! America needs your 
vote to keep going in an 
endless circle. 

Voting is about choic- 
es! We have 31 flavors of 
ice cream, 200 channels 
on the TV and 43,000 
blogs about cute cat 
pictures, and two politi- 
cal parties. Everyone in 
America is a Democrat 
or a Republican, just like 
everyone is named Dave 
or Becky. 

The two parties are 
as different as night and 
slightly later that night. 
Democrats love expen- 
sive social programs, 
but Republicans are hs- 
cally responsible. That's 
why the Republicans put 
an end lo Medicare and 
Social Security. Republi- 
cans like war, but Demo- 
crats prefer diplomacy. 
That's why the Demo- 
crats brought our troops 
home 6om Iraq. 



For every person who 
researches the issues, 
there are two who vote 
by picking the candidate 
with the nicest eyebrows. 
Their vote counts just as 
much as yours. Isn't de- 
mocracy great? 

You don't have to be 
'right' to have the right 
to vote! Before you can 
cut someone's finger- 
nails, you have to spend 
2,000 hours in cosmetol- 
ogy school and apply for 
a manicurist's license. To 
elect the people who run 
the country, all you need 
to do is stand in a voting 
booth long enough to fig- 
ure out which button is 
"Donkey" and which one 
is "Elephant." Why limit 
voting to people who are 
actually informed? Lim- 
iting voting to smart peo- 
ple would be like limiting 
driving to sober people. 

Majorities rule! To be 
good at sports, you have 
to be strong or talented. 
Bui voting's different! 
The only thing you need 
is to have more people 
on your team. As long as 
50.001 percent of Ameri- 
ca is on your side, youre 
a winner! It's like pick- 
ing a toothpaste because 
four out of five dentists 
recommended it. only 
the dentists don't have 
degrees or licenses and 



think "toothpaste" is how 
you fix broken dentures. 

Voting is magic! No 
money for school or 
childcarc? Let the tax- 
payers fool the bill! Vot- 
ing allows you to empty 
other people's wallets 
without the hassle of 
buying a ski mask. Voting 
gets you a tilde cash. It 
gets politicians millions 
of dollars, power, fame 
and their names written 
on the side of buildings. 
But hey. enjoy your gov- 
ernment cheese! 

Politicians need your 
vote to do their jobs! 
Without your vote, poli- 
ticians wouldn't have ac- 
cess to the IBS, the CIA or 
the ATF- That's the Bu- 
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms, which 
doesn't actually sell any- 
thing. 

Without the power 
structure, a president 
would be all alone in the 
war on terriers! Remem- 
ber, politicians are like 
children. They need you 
to sign a "permission 
slip" so they can tax you. 
arrest you or blow up 
foreigners. Voting means 
that, whoever wins, 
whatever the next presi- 
dent does, you asked for

History

By Kelly McLendon 



Earlier this year, TIME 
Magazine n;ported, 'his- 
tory shows that when it 
comes to the presidency, 
experience doesn't guar- 
antee success." 

Yet, many people are 
still caught up in deciding 
whether the next presi- 
dent should be an ex- 
Navy pilot with more than 
20 years of Senate experi- 
ence, or an Illinois lawyer 
with 3 years of applicable 
Senate experience. 

History might be able 
to assuage any doubts, 
or cement an already 
formed opinion on how 
political experience fac- 
tors into the selection of 
the President. 

The first President of 
the United States, the no- 
table George Washington, 
had little political experi- 
ence when he was elected 
to oversee the creation of 
a belter nation in 1789. 
Washington, however, is 
always regarded as one of

two of the nation's worst 
Presldcnls. This is not to 
say that McCain would 
be regarded In the same 
light, McCain's political

Oliama's, but he's alsu 25

Useless Information Overload 

How the Media alters the Election 



By Abigail Kopen 



It is getting harder 
and harder not (o notice 
thai many ptople seem 
10 base their vote com- 
pletely on a candidate's 
appearance, [l seems that 
people care more about a 
candidate's age. race, and 
personal life than politics 
- but why? Why are any nf 
those Tactors important 
in choosing a presiden- 
tial candidate instead or 
simply the issues facing 
the country at the time? 
It is because of the in- 
fluence of the media on 
campaigns and politics. 



Campaigns are nin 
through the media. If the 
media covered up thefac- 
es of the candidates and 
the only information that 
the world knew about 
them was their politics 
and opinions, elections 
would be very different. 
The media lends lo affect 
voters by giving them too 
much information about 
a candidate. 

Each election be- 
comes more and more 
degraded into something 
of a TMZ showcase than 
an educated and formal 
run for becoming the 
head of the country. The 
big culprits are commer- 
cials about the candi- 



dates, either endorsing 
or discrediting the candi- 
date and constant news 
coverage of the candi- 
dates and their families. 
where they arc, what 
they are doing there, 
wrhat they stand for, and 
who is with or not with 
them at that very second. 
Many candidates are 
now endorsed by celebri- 
ties. It's a vicious cycle of 
just way too much infor- 
mation and not enough 
unbiased journalism. 

According to "Psy- 
chology Today," Ameri- 
cans are faced with too 
much information and 
too many choices. "Some 
people respond by trying 



every pos- 
sibility thoroughly — and 
they are the unhappi- 
est of all." says Barry 
Schwartz, an author of 
six books about human 
behavior. A "maximizer," 
to use Schwartz's term, 
second -guesses his deci- 
sions, "constantly look- 
ing over his shoulder to 
see what he missed." 

How does this tie into 
the run for president? 
"People faced with too 
many options are likely 
to throw up their hands 
and not bother — even 
when a lot is at stake." 
says Schwartz. But there 
is lot at stake in choosing 
the next president of the 



country. 

The bottom line Is that 
free American citizens 
owe it to the country to 
vote, to be blind to age. 
sex. and race, and Jo sim- 
ply educate themselves 
as much as possible on 
the candidates. 

Once voters can ac- 
complish that, they can 
decide whether or not 
they ivant higher taxes, 
gay marriages, universal 
health care, or anything 
else. Either vVay, don't be 
swayed by the media; be 
swayed by the individual 
right to make educated 
decisions that line up 
with individual morals. 



Music that people 100 years ago would have enjoyed 



By Louisa Damelson 



There's just something 
about sbcteenth and sev- 
enteenth century instru- 
ments that evokes asensc 
of age. Maybe it is the gut 
strings on the carefully 
crafted wooden frames 
or maybe it is simply the 
style of the music. What- 
ever the cause. "Fanta- 
sies. Songs, and Dances: 
an Early Music Evening" 
was a modern glimpse of 
some of the music that 
people from hundreds 
of years ago would have 
enjoyed. 

Including music by such 
composers as lohn Dow- 



land, Orlando Gibbons, a much gentler sound, 
I.S. Bach and G.R Han- closer to that of a muted 
del, this concert focused guitar, 
on music for the viola Due to the fragile con-

As an-

er Ted 
Connor,

^^=^s^^^^ noted, 
when 
playing ancient instru- 
ments, "you spend half

This did nothing to de- 
ter from the grace of the 
music, however, I'or each 
work performed, listen- 
ers were taken back in 
tiTne lo an age of flicker- 
ing candles and pearl- 
bedecked costumes. Like 
a modern string quartet, 
the concert began with 
five violas da gamba 
placing together, accom- 
panied by light percus- 
sion. The instruments 
had a softer sound than 
modern violins and cel- 
los - they seemed to sigh 
at the ends of phrases 
and come to a delicate 
close at the end. 

A special highlight to 
the performance was 
a selection from Bach's 
St. Matthew Passion, 



"Komm susses Krcuz". 
Text sung for this work 
was translated by IPFW 
professor Melanle Book- 
out and German guest 
artist Uli Giese to Eng- 
lish from German. As 
Bookout stated. "This is 
one of the most famous 
pieces for viola da gam- 
ba." Although the two 
accompanying violas da 
gamba played in a lively 
style with rolled chords, 
the deep bass of singer 
Allen Saunders tinged 
the work with dolor. 



blending the whole into 
a low mahogany sound 
oflxinten passion. 

The close of the con- 
cen was more vibrant, 
including two dances by 
Anthony (lolbome. The 
Galliurd: Faerie Kound 
was cheery, sounding 
like a close ancestor of 
early American folk mu- 
sic. With the close of this 
work came the end of the 
concert - a short glimpse 
of early European music. 



Not another West Wing movie 



By Peter pcncd behind the doors a futile attempt to avoid 

Sdinellenberger oftheWestWing. but that grooving up. By bring- 

siatiWKirt js a minor discussion in ingio life many of Bush's 

Oliver 

Stone's 
What went wrong? This 

is the question George W. 

Bushmustbeaskinghim- 

self right now. Eight years 

ago things were right on 

track. The economy was 

going well, the U.S. dol- 
lar was worth the paper it 

was printed on, and our 

country was at peace. 

Then 9/ 1 1 happened and 

ewryihing fell apart. As a 

people we instinctively 

blamed our esteemed 

leader, the great George 

W. Bush. But was it truly 

all his fault? No Ameri- 
can can be blamed for 

9/ 1 1 however the events 

that followed are a differ- 
ent story. 

The film "W," gi\-es 

insight into what hap- 




portra\-al of Bush. As he displa\Tng how very 

goes through life, play- inhuman and tyianni- 

ing the part of a prover- cal Dick Cheney is. The 

bial Peter Pan, skipping morie proposes that 

out on rP5ponsibiht&gt;- in Bush is Cheney's puppet. 



After all he did propose 
an "oil empire' in the 
Middle East while at the 
same time declaring that 
there will be no exit plan 
concerning the invasion 
of Iraq. 

One must beg the qut", ■ 
tion, why now? Why h^is 
Oliver Stone released a 
movie about a president 
who is leaving office a 
month before elections? 
After all, it won't really 
influence the upcom- 
ing election - unless of 
course you think Bush 
and McCain are the same 
person even though 
diey aren't. Maybe Oli- 
ver just thought that a 
Bush movie would bring 
in capital during times 
like these. Whate\-er the 
case, 'W.' inspires some 
understanding of George 
Jr.'s decisions. After all he 
is 'the decision maker."

Rest assured, this team is 
going to mal&lt;e statements 



In All Directions - oped 

By Dan Vance 

vance-lad.btogspol.tom 

It was 2005 the only other time I have 
seen somcihing (he likes of what I saw 
when watching back-to-back-to-back 
IPFWvolleybali exhibition matches last 
Sunday. It was a completely revamped 
scene that sometimes saw all six active 
players on the court as new faces to 
everyone. 

Ablgsentorclasstastycarhadtobrecd 
a new, big freshman class this year, we 
all knew that. Bui thai concept scared 
me a bit. Ii scared me just as much as it 
did in 2005 when unfamiliar names like 
Brock Ullrich and Josh Stewart joined 
the familiar's of Matt Zybyszewski and 
Serdar Sikca. 

1 guess I can rest easy now. Because 
what 1 sawmade me cracka reminiscent 
smile. Much like that January day in 
2005, I have found myself thinking 
"these new kids- they are going to do 
alright." 

More than alright, they were pretty 
impressive on a 2-1 day where they 
hung with a pretty experienced Ball 
Slate, even in a loss. 

To me, last year's team and ilie 
personality driven spark that they put 
out cannot be replaced. But this team 
has already, in one day, gone a long way 
in reminding me that 1 also once had to 



adjust to those departed ex-players. 

The roster has the names of Rvelve 
players who. coming into this year, 
have never worn the blue and white 
in a match. Eight of them did il for the 
first time Sunday in Gates and for the 
most pan, they did it delightfully. 

While familiar faces of ex-IPFW 
players Dan McNemey and lason Yhost 
watched from the stands and another 
former player, Ion Bassillo, sat nearby 
on the sidelines as pan of the Quincy 
coaching staff- it was the sight of Phil 
Peterson, lonalhan Meyer, Eric Hardek 
and a host of others that peaked my 
interest the most. 

Peterson, thus far, is the most 
impressive I have seen a freshman be 
since losh Siewan in the 2005 regular 
season. He led IPFW in kills against 
Carthage and Ball Stale as well as overall 
for the day with a powerfully fast spike. 
Filling in the void of CI Macias. Ullrich 
and Yhost on the outside will be a 
difficull task, but Peterson showed that 
he will be a big part of that. And while 
his passing and defense sometimes 
looked weak, he also led IPFW on the 
block. I can see his versatility being the 
main ingredient in how successful this 
team can be from the early going, 

I'm equally impressed by the power, 
control and emotion of sophomore 
Darryl Shank, who played little as a 
freshman. Arnie Ball is going to have 
his hands full in deciding the balance

SHANKED: Though not a brand new face, sophomore Oarryt Shank (6) 
led strong in Sunday's exhibition with 12 kills against Quincy, 



bet\veen these two, as well as freshmen 
Hardek and Ivan Malos on the outsides 
as all four showed a major upside over 
the weekend with day-totals of 28, 24. 
18 and 10 kills (more than 60 percent of 
the team's total). 

And if it was only the outside hitters, 
I would still be impressed. But it was 
much more, 

Chris Brigson showed much of that 
freshman inexperience early on the 
offensive side but also helped stuff 
down the opponent with big middle 
blocks alongside Oliver Kook and 
Nathaniel Berg, Freshman Dan Mader 
is going to give Corey Stewart and 
Kevin Goncalves a run for their money 
at the setter spot where both Mader 



and Stewan showed Sunday that they 
are very capable of handling one of the 
mosi important positions of any IPFW 
team. And. I cannot wait to see the 
battle at libero bet^vecn the veterans 
Mike Morici and Matt Pliske, each of 
whom has led IPFW to a Final Four 
appearance. Not to mention, they have 
a little libero in the wings in Ganett 
Bitter who will be anxiously waiting, 
watching and learning. 

This team has restored hope in my 
mind (not that all of it was lost). If they 
continue to develop over these nexl two 
months of practice, I can only imagine 
that they ivill be a special thing to 
watch in many ways come that lanuary 
9 home opener.
