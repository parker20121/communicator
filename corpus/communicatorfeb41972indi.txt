Building F proposed, 
Parliament junked 



by Mark Franke 

PROPOSED ATHLETIC STRUCTURE 

Last week In the Purdue 
Faculty Senate, Dean anM 
Director Roger J. Manges 
announced that the proposal 
had been made to build an 
athletic structure. In 
considering the need for 
such a facility on this 
campus, the following 
facts should be kept in 
mind. 

I.) According to the 
space needs by functional 
catagorles, a ratio com- 
puted on the basis of 
number of students and 
academic needs, this cam- 
pus needs 21,350 square 
feet of physical recreation 
space. By 1978 this fig- 
ure will have doubled. 
This space estimate does 
not Include extra-curric- 
ular athletic programs. 
Of course, we have none at 
present. 

2.) The major function 
of the structure will be 
to house the School of 
Health, Physical Education, 
and Recreation. This will 
enable to University to 
offer full academic pro- 
grams in these areas. 
Secondly, the building 
will have facilities for 
general physical activity 
and recreation, facilities 
that can be taken advan- 
tage of by students in 
their leisure time. These 
are the two major functions 
to be served by this 
building. 

3.) By virtue of this 
structure being "Building 
F", following a Library, 
the Union, and thrt^e gen- 
eral education facilities 
it is obvious that It 



hasn't been high on the 
list of priorities. The 
more fundamental or basic 
needs of the campus have 
been satisfied first. 

Given the three reasons 
above, with particular 
attention to the academic 
programs in physical edu- 
cation. It Is my deep 
personal conviction that 
our campus is now in need 
of an athletic structure. 

CAMPUS PARLIAMENT 
Last week, the Indiana 
Faculty Senate voted down 
proposed legislation 
creating a Campus Psrlia- 
ment. The Parliament's 
strength, as envisioned by 
those of UB who supported 
its inception, was not in 
specific powers delegated 
It, but rather In Its 
vaguely-defined scope. 
The Parliament could have 
been whatever we would 
have cared to make it. 

But the Parliament Is 
dead. Its critics argued 
that It would simply be 
one more bureaucratic 
layer. To the contrary. 
It would have been capable 
of eliminating existing 
layers. It would have 
been the only body at 
this campus with author- 
ity by virtue of its 
prestige anil composition 
(both Faculties and Stu- 
dent Body). 

Its defeat is an iron- 
ical lesson for us. It 
was supported or opposed 
on the basis of parochial 
interest. He need a body 
such as the Parliament 
that will act in terms of 
the Interests of the en- 
tire university.

A plan for a r-ulti-

the Indiana-Purdue Campus 
at Port Mayne has been 
announced by Dean and Di- 
rector Roger Manges. 

Details of Che facility 
have not been made public. 

Students of the Fort 
Wayne Campus should con-

Are there higher priorities 
than an athletic building?

Letters 



Dear Editor: 

1 was glad to see a 
Carman article in the last 
COMMUNICATOR; however, my 
happiness ended when I 
discovered the poor con- 
tent of the article. After 
two grotesque jokes, there 
should not have been a 
hlgjily philosophical quote. 
It's like mixing sugar and 
garlic. The quote was 
good, but it didn't fit. 
Besides, there are so 
many quotes which were 
originally made In German 
and cannot be translated 
without losing much of 
their effectiveness. 

Thanks for trying any- 
how.

Apologies to Franke 

Apologies to Student 
Body President Mark Franke 
and to the Student Govern- 
ment. Franke 's column was 
published without his by- 
line in last week's paper. 
He, not the COhQ^UNICATOR, 
was responsible for the 
article "Free University 
Lists Hew Classes."

tate the goals of a com- 
muter campus. Is the 
planned facility to be 
a HPER facility, a var- 
sity facility, an in- 
tramural facility, or a 
combined facility? 

Mill the planners of 
this facility be respons- 
ive to a referendum from 
the university connunlty 
on the desirability of 
such a facility? What 
opportunity will the 
members of the univers- 
ity community have in

Mental health technicians stage 



Dear Editor: 

Last week you sustained 
much criticism concerning 
the 15th Issue of the COM- 
MUNICATOR. Having exam- 
ined the 16th Issue, I 
think that you merit the 
approval of the critics 
for responding Co their 
objections. 

I am pleased to see the 
COMMUNICATOR is attempcing 
to return to the high stan- 
dards of responsible jour- 
nalism It should adhere to.

awareness session 

by John Logan 

The mental health tech- 
nicians under the guidance 
of their Instructor Bob 
Hawley co-ordinated the 
first awareness session at 
the regional campus last 
week. Participants In the 
session Included the mental 
health technicians them- 
selves and minority group 
members picked randomly 
from the campus conmunity . 
The majority of the minority 
participants were black 
students and staff members, 
while all except one of the 
mental technicians parti- 
cipating were white. 

Dr. Hawley described 
Che goal of the awareness 
session as the discovery 
and breaking down of pre- 
judice so that people can 
meet each other as people. 

In this particular In- 
stance the goal was pri- 
marily Co .-nake the whites 
aware of their prejudices 
and to give them an oppor- 



Although some partlci- 
p.^ncs felt that the for- 
mal structure of the ses- 
sion was coo restrictive, 
most expressed a desire 
to participate again. 

Dr. Hawley conrnented 
chat he was greatly pleased 
by co-operation on the 
part of the minority par- 
ticipants and the enthu- 
siasm displayed by the 
white participants. Be- 
cause of the success of 
this session, Dr. Hawley 
plans to repeat tfie ses- 
sions In Free University 
classes.

3 bands, 3 sounds featured 
at Mid -Winter Carnival 



by Davi 



Hill 



Included in Hid-Wlnter 
Carnival activities last 
weekend were dances on 
Friday and Saturday nights. 
The muFlc Friday was pro- 
vided by Connecticut, 9 
Geven-man band from Ohio 
State. The group was 
billed as having the 
"Chicago" sound, and had 
a three-man horn section. 
"Connecticut" plsyed many 
currently popular songs, 
with several songs by 
Chicago. The small crowd 
on hand seemed to enjoy 
Che bands' music. 

Saturday night "The 
Buoys" famous for their 
hit single 'Timothy", and 
"Smoke", a student-faculty 
group entertained. 

Smoke included Dr. Ken 
Kassover at the piano. Dr. 
Jon Halstead on bass and 
Kent Stler on drums. Any- 
one who thought the group 
was going to be a Joke re- 
ceived a pleasant surprise. 
The group played an hour 
and a hnlf o£ Jazz, fea- 
turing Dr. Kassover. 

After a 15 minute Inter- 
mission "The Buoys" took 
the stage for thrir set. 

I The Classifieds 



Pe sonally, I didn't know 
what to -ypect '^"^n the 
group. My only previous 
exposure to them was 
the song "Timothy'', which 
I didn't particularly like. 

The opening half hour 
of the set consisted of 
quiet Music with acousti- 
cal qultars. From the 
first song everyone In 
the large crowd knew that 
"The Buoys" were no ordin- 
ary group. The singing 
was beautiful and the 
playing masterful. Their 
version yf "Suite Judy 
Blue Eyes" was exactly 
like the record. 

"The Buoys" used a mix- 
ture of their own material 
and other people's songs 
for the rest of the night. 
They did two knockout 
encores, "Somebody to Love" 
and "Southern Man." This 
concluded nearly two hours 
of non-stop music, during 
which the band constantly 
kept up a fast pace. 

"The Buoys" proved why 
-they have played with 
nearly every major group 
In the country, and have 
never failed to get a 

Im standing ovation from a 
college audience.

ALIENATION, ANOMIE, AND THE 

AMERICAN STUDENT 

P.irt 1 

By Scott GUlIe 

To Innovate in higher 
education, as to create 
through arc forma, requires 
that those who seek to 
Innovate escape the pri- 
son of our present con- 
cepts. Too often, we re- 
strict our field of vision 
to the comfortable, the 
ordinary, and the routine. 
In higher education, the 
day-to-day operations of 
the Institutions constitute 
the sum of reality. 

If we can break out of 
our narrow concepts, we 
may find solutions to some 
of our complex problems. 
These solutions may well 
be B mple In comparison Co 
the apparent complexity of 
our problems. But as 
Marshall McLuhan has deft- 
ly reminded us, "Uhoever 
It was discovered uater, 
you can be sure It wasn't 
B fish." 

In nearly every discus- 
sion of the fuCure of high- 
er education, there emerge 
three distinct points of 
view, A student points 
oiit, "It's mostly buUshlC 
now. Starting from this 
foundation, the university 
can only get worse; how- 
ever, 1 find it difficult 
CO Inugine how It could 
get any worse. For the 
situation to Improve, the 
university must change 
fundamentally." The stu- 
dent's inarticulatenesB is 
possibly his best argument. 
"They don't care about 
their studies anymore. If 
they would spend more time 
in the library than they 
do bitching, there wouldn't 
be any problems," a hold- 
over professor fr m the 
good old days points out. 
The third point of view 
comes from the Administra- 
tor: "Calm down, gentle- ■ 

men. Our program 

to be instituted next faU 
if the state legislature 
approvi&gt;s should at least 
partially remedy the situ- 
ation." 

Throughout the sixties, 
the student power inove- 

Intramurals urged 
to report games 

The 22 intramural basket- 
ball squads will be entering 
their second full week of 
action next week. 

Teams are urged to send 
reports of Chelt games to 
the COMMUNICATOR. Due to 
printing deadlines, only 
scores through Monday of 
the previous week will 
appear in each issue. 



ment pressed for institu- ' 
tional change in the uni- 
versities. Unfortunately, 
the movement was little 
.ible to break away from 
Che despicable de.ins', pres- 
idents', and professors' 
way of viewing the alter- 
natives to mass higher ed- 
ucation. The complaint 
made by those in the move- 
ment was quite general: 
"The university is rotten," 
Specific Issues were 
raised concerning univer- 
sity complicity with the 
Vietnam War, biological 
warfare research, censor- 
ship of dissent, and others 
less familiar. The thread 
of continuity from Peoples' 
Park, til ."■IiKiibla lo Jock- 
son State seams to me to 
be related, however, to 
the overall dissatisfaction 
of students with the uni- 
versity as proclaimed tn 
the general statement a- 
bove. The change sought 
througli the student power 
movement was for author- 
ity to be placed in the 
hands of students. 

As a sympathizer and 
participant (to this day) 
in the student power move- 
ment, I see two flaws lead- 
ing to the futility and 
fatality of the movement. 
The first is that it is 
not a student pO'jer move- 
ment. 

As students, our In- 
authenticity is self-pro- 
fessed. We play games on 
tests CO gee credits to get 
degrees. This reduces the 
movement to a power strug- 
gle. 

The second flaw is that 
we have failed to create 
real alternatives. The 
solution proposed Is that 
one elite be substituted 
with another. 1 fail to 
see the difference. 

Senate prospects 
of two parties 

Candidates In the Stu- 
dent Senate race Monday 
will be running on two 
tickets, Che Alliance for 
a Better Campus Party, 
and the Independent Tarty.

nounced candidates Obie 
Booker, Rosle Hover, Hike 
Lewis, and Gary Trowbridge. 
Booker and Lewis are In- 
diana University students, 
while Hower and Trowbridge

Independent Party can- 
didates are Jane Kitson

chuck of Purdue, 

Voting will take place 
all day Monday.

The Mastodon cagers 
have come upon hard times, 
losing their last four 
contests. 

The first loss came 
Wednesday night. J.in. 26, 
against Ft. Wayne' Bible 
College 68-53. Bruce 
Masopust scored 30 points 
for the winners, and lU-P 
was led by Gary Trump 
and John Powell with 18 
and 13 points respectively. 

Friday night the Masto- 
dons traveled to Jeffer- 
sonvllle to play lU-South- 
east and canie out on the 
short end of an 64-81 
score. 

The home team overcame 
a five point Mastodon ad- 
vantage Incurred before 
the game even at.irted. 
lU-Southeast came out 
wearing the wrong num- 
bers, and was hit with 
5 technical fouls, all 
of which were scored by 
Indiana-Purdue. Hark 
Putt and John Powell 
shared the Mastodon scoring 
lead with 17 points apiece. 

A fine Marlon team 
downed the Mastodons Sat- 
urday night in Indiana- 
polis. Shooting a torrid 
60 per cent from the floor, 
the Knights piled up 116 
poincs, compared to only 
68 for lU-P. Steve Yahn 
had 14 points for the 
Mastodons and John Powell 
added 1^. 

Last Wednesday night 
Purdue North Central 
downed lU-P at Central 
High gyrti by a 93-83 score. 
Thp Mastodons rallied In 
the second half, when 
Paul Jacquay scored 20 
of his game-high 26 points. 
Their rally fell short 
as North Central countered 



ich balanced scoring. 
Five players scored in 
double figures for the 
winners. John Powell 
and Gary Trump each added 
16 points for lU-P.
