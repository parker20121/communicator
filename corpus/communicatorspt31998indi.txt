Undergraduate 
research award 



IPFW students who have con- 
ducted undergraduate research may 
be eligible for the first annual I^1lin 
Sanipai Memorial Undergraduate 
Research Award. 

Pulin Sampai, a native of 
Calcutta, India, graduated in com- 
puter science, earning a bachelor of 
science degree from the School of 
Engineering. Technology and 
Computer Science in 1994. 

He received a scholarship to 
attend Brandeis University. 

He died as a result of a severe 
asthma attack on January 26, 1996. 

At the time of his death, he was 
a graduate student at Drandeis 
University, working on a Ph.D. in 
Neuroscience. 

Sampai was an exemplary stu- 
dent, delving deeply into the many 
subjects he studied, from computer 
science to Jungian psychology. 

He became intrigued with 
research and soon found himself 
involved in several undergraduate 
research projects. 

He worked with IPFW profes- 
sors in computer science, physics, 
mathematics, biology and geology. 

To many of the friends Sampai 
left behind, Pulin was much more 
than a remarkable student. 

He developed his own personal 
philosophy based on the wisdom of 
the Upanishads, on Hinduism and 
on the views of Thoreau. 

He lived deliberately, showing 
unconditional love and worked self- 
lessly for the sake of work. 

The family and friends of Pulin 
Sampat have established the under- 
graduate research award in 
Sampat's memory. 

As Jun Eng, 1995 IPFW gradu- 
ate and currently a graduate student 
at the University of Michigan, 
explained, "(Whiie] Pulin would 
not have cared whether his name 
was attached to such a pri^e, he 
would have liked the idea of recog- 
nizing outstanding undergraduate 
research within IPFW. 

"He would have liked die idea 
^l future students would be told a 
siory about another student who did 
unexpected things, especially if thai 
story helped show them that similar 
things are within their reach." Eng 
added. 

A five-member panel of judges, 
, comprised of four faculty members 
from four differeni schools widiin 
IPFW as well as one ondergradu,iie 
judge selected by the International 
Students' Organizations, will select 
the wiimer. 

The recipient of this award will 
receive a S250 prize and will be rec- 
ognized at the IPFW Honors 
Convocation on Oct. 4. 1998. 

The applicant must explain the 



nature and significance of research 
insufficient detail to enable the fac- 
ulty judges in unrelated disciplines, 
as well as the undergraduate judge, 
to evaluate it accurately. 

Application forms are available 
in the following locations: Kettler 
252 and 289, Science 330, Neff 240, 
and Walb 118. 

Completed applications can be 
relumed to Multicultural Services,

Topic: 

Princess Di and 
other dead 
people 

Our Verdict: 

The people are 
dead; let them 
rest In peace. 



If you happened lo miss 
it , ihc anniversary of 
Princess Diana's dcalh was 
on Aug. 31. It was hard lo 
avoid on lelevision. and 
everyone was offering their 
Inpul on how Diana affecicd 
Iheir lives and how they 
miss her. 

To tell you I he 
trulh, we really don't 
miss her. How can you 
miss her. when almost 
once or twice a week 
you hear about some- 
thing related lo her, or, 
about some new prod- 
uct that has come out 
for her foundation, or 
about other people try- 
ing lo make some 
money off of her death. 
We're sure that you 
have seen the Princess 
Di collectible Beanie 
Baby that is a purple- 



colored bear with a while 
rose embroidered on iis 
chest, or how about the col- 
lectable plate?All of this is 
exploit ing what good the 
woman actually did in her 
life, just to make a few 
bucks. 

Why was there so much 
media coverage of the 
anniversary of Di's death? 
The answer is simple. The 
royal family has been seen 
as the greatest soap opera of 
the last few decades or 
more. How many people 
viewed at least part of Di 
and Charles' marriage? The 
answer is simply tliis: an 
uncountable number. Now 
that one character has been 
written out, the story has to 
continue by paying atten- 
tion to her sons who now 
have to grow up without a 
mother. 

The thing thai we are 
trying lo figure out is why 
we still pay any attention to 
the royal family at all. As 



far js we can remember, the 
US gave up ihe monarchy 
over 200 years ago. Why 
should we still have to put 
up with all of the hype? 

If we remember correct- 
ly, didn't Mother Teresa die 
just a short time after 
Princess Di? We didn't hear 
much news about the 
anniversary of her death. As 
far as we're concerned, 
Mother Teresa was a much 
more important person in 
what she accomplished in 
her life. 

To add lo all the hype 
that revolved around the 
anniversary of Di's death, 
someone had to talk lo 
Elton John, who com- 
plained that she shouldn't 
have been buried ai her 
family estate, but rather at 
Westminster Abbey. 

Frankly, who really 
cares where she's buried? 
No one is ever going to be 
able to ever see her grave 
anyway. Just imagine if 




'For the dead there are 
no more toils." 



-Sophocles 



by Denny She, Editorial Cartoonist 



people were to see her 
grave; it would be much 

worse than the chaos sur- 
rounding Jim Morrison's 
final resting place. 

The cemetery in which 
Morrison was buried is 
rumored to have been 
closed to the public due to 
the amount of traffic and 
vandalism that has gone on. 
We are sick and tired of 
being reminded of the trag- 
ic events of the deaths of 
celebrities. For who knows 
how many years straight in 
April we have been remind- 
ed of the death of Kurt 
Cobain. Who really wants 



to be reminded of how he 
died alone? Why don't we 
try another approach and try 
to remember their lives and 
not some of the trivial 
things that surrounded their 
deaths? 

Why do we celebrate the 
anniversary of the deaths of 
some personalities or 
celebrities and not others? 
We never heard a peep 
about George Burns after 
his death, and he brought 
joy and laughter to millions 
of people. 

What we're wailing for 
is the anniversary of the 
death of John Denver. 



We're already stocking up 
on 8-tracks and granola bars 
for the ceremony, 

Finally, we would just 
like to say that from now on 
could we just please forget 
about people's deaths and 
concentrate more on the 
positive things that people 
had to contribute to the 
world that we live in? 

Also, could someone put 
and end to this Beanie Baby 
thing? It's gelling to be a 
little ridiculous.

IPFW Coverage 



Financial Aid 



I write to thank the News 
Sentinel and Frost Illustrated 
for Iheir fine work in research- 
ing and explaining the multi- 
ple problems inside and out- 
side the Indiana- Purdue Fori 
Wayne Campus. I hope that 
the students there have kept as 
close an eye on the story as 
Ihe policymakers in our area. 
Your coverage is acknowl- 
edged by all policymakers as 
significant, credible and often 
quite brave. ll'FW Student 
Senate needs to listen up. 

The recent faculty report 
on funding leaves more work 
to be done, as our local stu- 
dents are bearing an even 
greater weight than their on- 
campus counterparts than sim- 
ple hourly tuition differences. 
Thanks to legislators like 
Winfield Moses and the coura- 
geous work of the former 
chancellor Joanne Lantz. both

antz was especially coura- 
geous in her aggressive efforts 
outside the wishes of Dr. 
Beering's over-bearing colo-

The students of IPFW can 
affect some real change with 
the legislature if they can use 
their student power to organize 
by late October a 
grassroot effort to help favor- 
able legislators gel more 
money so their tuition can be 
more fair. This effort is critical 
to success and reflects the fact 
that student -consumers of 
IPFW are the only ones free to 
speak for the needs of the 
school. 

My personal experience in 
working with Dr. Wanel! is 
that he is exactly what Dr. 
Deering wants him to be, and 
that does nol include anything 
crcaiive, especially involving

In respon.se to Ihe Staff 
Editorial: Financial Aid, I 
would like to add some com- 
ments of my own. 

First of all, when we deal 
with Financial Aid. we are basi- 
cally dealing with Ihe govern- 
ment and anyone who has any 
prior experience in dealing with 
the government, knows how 
difficult it can be. I know. 
because ! spent four years in tlie 
U.S. Army and I am a student at 
IPf^V. So I have come to expect 
the worst when it comes to the 
Government in any shape or 
form. If you Uiink Financial Aid 
is bad, just pray that you never 
need Slate Assistance. 

Second, 1 learned the hard 
way that it is best to turn in 
your FAFSA as soon as possi- 
ble. If you don't get any 
response from the main office 
after a month, call them. They 
have several numbers they can 
be reached at. Don't go to the 
financial Aid office if you 
haven't received your FAFSA in 
the mail. If you didn't get it in 
the mail, dien the Financial Aid 



office hasn't got anything either. 

Third, an easy way of filling 
out die FAFSA form is to use 
the "FAFSA on the web" form. 
Or download the "FAPSA 
Express" software lo your com- 
puter. You can file your FAFSA 
on the web if you are a first 
time filer or filing a renewal 
application. Using this electron- 
ic form will speed up the whole 
process by not having to use the 
U.S. mail. Not to mention the 
possibility of your applicaiion 
getting lost in the mail. Another 
plus when filing on the web is 
that you can make a copy of it 
onto a floppy disk. The disk 
will set itself up with a pass- 
word protection program, so 
that only you will be able to 
view it. 

Now you might tfiink that 
this isn't a safe way to file your 
form, but it is no riskier than 
sending it by mail and having it 
inlercepted by the wrong per- 
son. When the form is filed 
over the Internet, it is encryplcd 
by the browser, which keeps it 
from easily being looked at by 



the wrong individual. If you 
ifiink about it, is anything 100 
percent safe? No. but of course 
nol. Besides, your form is sent 
electronically from the main 
office lo the Financial Aid 
office at IPFW and a hacker 
with enough knowledge and 
luck could break into any sys- 
tem. 

Finally 1 would like to say 
that out of all the government 
institutions, the Financial Aid 
office has been die best in help- 
ing me out. Sometimes they get 
tilings mixed up, but nobody is 
perfect. Now they don't always 
seem to be the friendliest of 
people, but I would guess that it 
depends on who you get when 
you talk to ihem and what kind 
of mood they are in. If you 
think Financial Aid is bad, wait 
until you have to deal with the 
IRS, Just Ihink of Financial Aid 
as anodier class for dealing with 
the government.

what's weak this week 



I jusi want lo say '"welconie 
back" lo all of (bosc reluming slu- 
(Icnls and a hearty "good luck" lo 
aJl of those new siuLlcnt&gt;; who will 
call IPFW home for ihc next 35 
weeks. It seems as ir il was only 
yesterday that 1 was complaining 
about this or that. In Tact, il proba- 
bly was. Last week wc opened up 
tbe new school year and already. 
I've rwliced some weaknesses. 

For all of Ihosc who aie new to 
campus, or college allogeUier, I 
have put logcihcr a list of things 
[lull we should do around here lo 
make things go more smoothly. 
Unforlunaicly, some people jusi 
don' I follow the rules. Shame on 
litem. For those of us who do fol- 
low the rules, I give Ihanks. So, 
pay attention; I might be talking 
,iboui you. 

RULEHl-Benice. You might 
have been a tough guy in high 
school, but here, wc can lake you. 
The atliiude needs to be turned 
down just a liiile bit. Relax and 
have fun. This is the pan of your 
life where the process of neiwork- 
ing begins. Sicp on somebody 
iiuw. and ihey just may be inier- 
viewing you lomorrow. This town 
is supposed to be full of 
Christians: so act like il. try hold- 




U U U U U &gt;i*ii7 u u tJ&gt; kSU 



On Monday, Aug. 17. citirtns 
.icro^s the U.S. witnessed I'resideni 
Cliniun admit to having an affair 
with a woman. Monica Lewinsky. 
who is old enough lo be his daugh- 
ter. And my oh my, the public was 
outraged. A surprised nation longed 
to know the Inith. And once Ihey 
heard it straight from the source. 
they hungered lo know every detail 
that lead to the affair Uiat was just 
"not appropriate." 

In fact, the day after the presi- 
deni's address, people began to hear 
all the secret details sunounding the 
two lovebirds. The confiscated gifts 
lo Lewinsky and itie notorious tie 
(an ugly one at ihai) were men- 
tioned in nearly every newspaper 
and magazine covering the indecent 
act. The public just could not gel 
enough. 



ing a door for once, too, M.inners 
shouldn't disappear when you lum 
18. 

RULE flZ- Slow down. I know 
that there are speed limit signs on 
campus and I've seen them. The 
parking lots arc full of students 
everyday. hJlting one of them 
would be a le.rible way to .start 
college. Just leave earlier, you 
know parking will be difficult, 
deal with it. And lum down the 
PulT Daddy and Meiallica, When I 
honk at you for being a bad driver. 
I want you lo be able to hear me. 
The drivers in ihis town are bad 
enough. Let's uy to make this a 
safe campus. 

RULE #3- Be quiet. This isn"t 
high school. Quit screaming in the 
halls. Some of us are actually in 
the clas.^rooms ti^'ing lo learn. 1 
don't think I've seen Ihis many 
freshmen since 1 have been out 
here. Most of you carry yourselves 
very well and we hope that you 
succeed here at IPFW, or wherever 
else you end up. But there are 
always going to be the clowns and 
jerks in our system. I hope you 
flunk out. we don'i need you here. 

RUI,E #4- Be paiieni. Tlie old 
cliche "College isn't for every- 
body" always pops up at ihis time 
of year. Don'i buy il. You can sue- 



On lop of the affair. Clinton 
was. and still is, being accused of 
coercing people lo lie on his behalf 
in order to protect himself in the 
Lewinsky and Paula Jones cases. In 
fact, if proven guilty of these accu- 
.saiions. he could be impeached. 

On the third day. Americans had 
so many details, they did not know 
what to think when a sudden bomb- 
ing of alleged terromt targcLs in 
Sudan and Afghanistan- took place. 
People thought of similarities 
between the incident acts and the 
events that took place in ilie film 
"Wag the Dog," in which a presi- 
dent tries to hide a sex scandal by 
allowing cohorts to create a war to 
distract the public before an 
eleciion. 

So, as the week drew to a close, 
everyone was in question as to how 
far tJiey could trust the man who 
was leading their country. It was 
amazing to see one man's populari- 
ty take a drastic nosedive. And it all 
began with his a^air. 

Is ihc country mote upset that 
he had the affair or the fact that he 
lied about his involvement from the 
heginning? If you get right down to 
il. the "relationship" was what shot 
off the flares. Honestly, what man 
tells the truth when he's sleeping 
around with another woman? 

A man cheating on his wife is 
not something that is all that uncom- 
mon. Even though ii is nol necessar- 
ily something that we should be 
proud of, it does happen often. And 




Them or us?

scratching, but you

scratch!

ceed here or at any other institu- 
tion. There are a TON of resources 
here on campus. "Ibe library, (ihai 
big building) isn't great, but ihey 
have a fantastic sLiff and will help 
you as much as they can. The 
Writing Center and MuUiculiurat 
Services are just two of the many 
services provided to us for free. 
Hang in dicre. Don't do il alone. 
Join a study group, talk to your 
profes,sors, make some friends. 

RULES5- Be supponive. I 
know this is a "commuter cam- 
pus." but we have lots of ihings to 
do. We have a nationally ranked 
volleyball leam. men and womens 
basketball, .sofiball. baseball, and 
several odicr sporLs. We will have 
free lectures from some pretly 
famous people, and there will be 
plays and other cultural events as 
well. We also have some pretty 
cheap grub in the cafeteria and in 
the basemeni of Keiller. Be Irue to 
your school, be true to your city, 
get out and cheer for Ihc Dons. 
Check out The Communicator 
every Thursday for game times 
and event calendars, 

RULE (16- Be yourself. Usi 
year was Tommy and Nike, Ihis 
year is Gap, I mean Old Navy and 
that ugly Fubu stuff. Try to be 
more of an individual and less like 



a follower. Be original, it will help 
your brain work better, and save 
you some cash. If you see il on 
MTV today, it will be out of style 
in January. But hey. it's your 
money. What do I know'? 1 grew up 
in the seventies, dude. 

Rule #7- Re.spcct people. Treat 
people how you would like to be 
treated. Don't like people in your 
face'? Then don't get in iheirs. 
Walk away from compromising 
situations. Don't chat so much in 
cla.ss thai you become disruptive: 
this isn't daycare, it's college. 
Socialize outside. If you aren't into 
being here, stay home or drop out. 

Rule H8- Work hard, I have to 
study to get O's and C's. Il is a 
drag. Studying isn't the most fun 
thing to do in Uie world, but you 
need to make time for it. If you arc 
one of those brainiacs who doesn't 
need to study to get good grades, 
well, we hale you! Just kidding, 
son of. Don't get bad grades and 
complain that the cla'is is hard. 
Work hard and tlie results will be 
there. 

RULE #9- Recycle, Itey, it's 
your planet. You guys are sup- 
posed 10 be the sLicker, I hope not. 
All aluminum cans are recyclable. 
Stop throwing them out in the 
wasiebaskeis. Maybe we need 



more bins around campus'? And 
what about the plastic pop bottles? 
How many of Ihosc are tossed out? 
Student government, Ihis is 
addressable, is it not? Save the 
planet. Reduce, re-use, and recy- 
cle. 

RULE #10- Have fun. ntijoy 
yourself here. It isn't supposed to 
be easy. Some of you arc here from 
olhcr schools. It will take lime lo 
adjust. Some of you will he leav- 
ing here afler a year: diis is a g(K&gt;d 
time lo develop your skills as siu- 
dents, and as people. Enjoy the 
fact that you are getting a chance 
at higher education. It will pay off 
in the long run.

This week: The American 
Public. Why are we so fascinated

becau.se it had to do with .sex? 
This is Ihc same country where

like Clinton's tuneni dilemma, the 
country does not lake il lightly 

Actor and director Woody 
Allen's popularity quickly vani,shed 
after it was known that he had an 
affair widi his own foster child, widi 
whom he still maintains a relation- 
ship. "Titanic" director James 
Cameron got "ihe boot" after his 
wife, actress Linda llamilton, found 
him widi another woman. The pub- 
lic still hasn't fully forgiven actor 
Bun Reynolds for cheating on 
actress Lonnic Anderson. And 
rumors still thrive as to whedier 
screen legend Marilyn Monroe was 
involved with Johh F. Kennedy, one 
of the most popular presidents of all 
time. 

Have people not become u.sed to 



this type of behavior in the 90s? It 
seems hard to believe thai our coun- 
try, widi a divorce rale of nearly 50 
percent, would react this way. Sadly 
enough, maniage does not hold the 
sentiments it held 20 years ago. and 
this is not by the fault of one man's 
actions, 

Clinton's personal life is 
becoming an open book. A book 
that the rest of the nation, besides 
his family, should have no business 
reading. In his own words, "It's 
nobody's business but ours," which 
is what most Americans would say 
of Iheir own lives. 

Ilierefore. if Americans hate 
Clinton for having an affair widi 
obviously conniving Lewinsky, ihcy 
may want to exiimine Ihe lives of 



those around them. 

Neatly .10 percent of ;ill niarricd 
men cheat on their wives; Uiis is a 
statistic that seems to be growing 
with each new year. 

He was "not appropriate." and 
he admitted Ihat. While i[. may 
destroy his marriage and family, it 
should not affect the way he makes 
presidential decisions. Vet, he did 
lie, and people have a right lo judge 
his actions. 

So, if you are one of Ihe thou- 
sands that di.slikc the man running 
our country, m.ike sure you base 
your decision on things that actually 
affect you and nol ^iogs you hear 
are going oii^urTdor^is sweaty 
sheets. -■■-.: ^

Elusive Destiny, Part Two: When Lost Souls Collide.. 



Features Editor 

As the sun wenl down over a small apartnieni 
building, a young man was climbing Ihe stairs to 
ihe higher of ihe iwo aparlments in the complex. 

He'd jusi relumed from a trip through town 
with only one conclusion: there was itothing to do 
in this town on a Sunday. 

He entered Ihe building and glided the door 
shut, careful not to disturb the sleeping corpse of a 
body lying on the couch. 

wikjng 10 the refrigerator and getting a beer, 
he sighed and sai down in from of the television. 

Scanning through the channels, he was only 
met with more frustration, finally settling on base- 
ball. 

"This sucks," he couldn't help saying aloud to 
himself, sitting back to watch the final endings of 
a meaningless ball game. 

After fifteen minutes had made his evening 
stretch an eternity, he was sianled by a groan from 
the direction of his presumed dead roommate, fol- 
lowed shortly thereafter by a series of choice swear 
words. "Tim? What happened to me. man?" 

"Well Mark, there was an accident. You'll be 
fine, but the whiskey bottle didn't make it. Your 
liver's in critical condition as well," 

"You ain't kiddin'. man. Ever think about cut- 
tin' me off there?" Mark said with what voice he 
could muster. 

"1 thought about it. yeah. Didn't think you'd like 
it too much, though. Besides, you're too enienain- 
ing when you're drunk," Tim replied with half a 
smile. 

"I'll remember that. man. What lime is it, any- 
way?" 

"Going on 8:30." 

"Tbo early." Mark said as he went for the 
aspirin. "Do we have anything let^ for breakfast? 
I'm starvin'." 

"Yeah, we do, but you might wanna sian with 
dinner," Tim said with a laugh. Mark dropped the 
aspirin on the lloor at his feel and walked over to 
the window. Pulling back the curtains, he realized 
his mistake. "Well." Mark siud wiOi a tinge of evil 
in his voice. "While we're both up. may. as well 
make the best of it and go lookin' for some com- 
pany for the evening, Been to town yet, dude?" 

"Yeah, and there isn't anything out there. Gotia 
hate Sundays sometimes," tlm said as he went for 
another beer "Nothing goin' on and nothin' lo look 
forward to." 



"I heard that," Mark said as he sat back down 
on the couch and flipped through the channels 
himself. After a long silence, Mark went to the 
kitchen to fix something to eat. "You've got that 
job interview tomorrow, don't you?" 

"Yeah, bright and early," Tim replied sarcasti- 
cally. "I just hope it isn't another one of those crap 
Jobs where the boss gives you more to do than they 
have to get done. People like that should be banned 
from positions of power." 

"Have you talked lo anyone out there yet?" 
Mark asked as he sat down with tiis dinner. 

'Yeah, some Michelle lady. She wasn't too 
pleasant, but great body. Goiia love the tall ones. 
you know? I tfiink she's gonna be training me out 
tJiere. cause she's the only other paralegal that 
works there," 

"Killer. Can't be that bad of a job." 

"Guess I'll find out tomorrow," Tim said as he 
stole the remote from Mark. Drink it away, he told 
himself, and tilings will be belter in the morning. 

As night passed into day and the Earth came lo 
li fe again, a restless body began lo stir on the other 
side of town. 

Michelle dreaded the day ahead of her, having 
spent most of the previous night convincing herself 
she had made the right decision in getting rid of her 
drunken boyfriend. 

She really didn't mind it when people drank a 
little bit socially, just as long as they didn't take 
things too far. 

Aaron, however, had been steadily evolving 
into a flill-blown alcoholic and she really didn't 
want to be there when the ship hit rock bottom. 

If he wants to waste his life away, he can do 
whatever he wants as far as she's concerned. She 
wasn't going to be around for him to waste hers. 
though. 

11115 she thought about as she groggily put on 
some coffee and got ready for work. 

Today was to be relatively light at the office, 
she recalled, so it shouldn't be too taxing on her. 

All she remembered she had to do of impor- 
tance was interview a man applying for a paralegal 
position and look over a couple of cases for her 
employers. 

That was the beauty of being a paralegal. 
Although the work could be tough sometimes and 
she'd find herself doing the work of four by her- 
self, other times she'd have to scramble around to 
find work. 

With the addition of this new guy. her scram- 
bling days were bound to increase. That is, if he 
makes the cui. 



Eventually. Michelle finally found herself ai the 
office. 

As she thought back, she didn't even remember 
the drive through town nor even getting ready for 
work. 

Her mind was completely distracted today and 
it was all because of something as shipid as her ex- 
boyfriend. 

As she got out of her car. she paused and 
looked at herself in the mirror. "No more of this." 
she said to herself. 

"It'll all be in the past sooner when you slop 
making it a pan of the present. No more" With a 
renewed sense of duty. Michelle went inside and 
sat down at her desk. Today was going to be a good 
day. 

Time drifted by pretty fast as Michelle found the 
old passion for her work that had escaped het. 

Pretty soon she heard a knock on the door and 
the creaking of rusty hinges. "Whoops," she 
thought lo herself "Guess I missed 
oiling those hinges." 

As she gazed on at the door, she 
almost couldn't believe her eyes. 
There before her stood one of the 
most attractive men she'd seen 
around there in years. Tall, black 
hair, and an innocent smile. Tim 
walked in the room like he already 
had the job. 

Shaking it off, Michelle got to 
the interview. "Hi Tim. Nice to see 
you again. My name's Michelle," 
she said as she motioned for him to 
have a seat. "Now, it's my under- 
standing from your resume that 
you've just recendy graduated, cor- 
rect?" 

"Yes ma'am," Tim replied cour- 
teously. "I made it through law 
school in three years with adequate 
comments from my professors, but 
I've yet lo take the bar exam. I'm 
looking for a little experience in the 
field before I embark upon my own 
endeavors." 

"That sounds like a good plan," 
Michelle said back. "However, you 
need to be aware that with five 
practicing attorneys working in our 
firm that the workload can be quite 
overwhelming from time to lime. 
especially considering each attor-

Web Review: Internet provides ample entertainment for those with time to kill 



Features Editor 

Rccenily I must confess ihat I wnMc an 
editorial condemning the quality of the 
Internet. In recent monihs, however, I musi 
also confess that my opinion has slowly 
been changing as more and more people 
bring to my attention more and more sites 
worthy of praise. 

Feeling somewhat guilty for having the 
benefit of countless people correcting me 
and not sharing the results with those that 
may have read the editorial in question, I've 
resolved to make the readers of The 
Communicator informed of my more inter- 
esting findings. 

The Tint site I found interesting (not so 
much for what it docs but by what it 
attempts to accomplish) was www.jennl- 



camAtrg. This site, made and maintained by 
the same person that stars in it, is a site ded- 
icated fully 10 the life in the average 
woman's apartment. 

The camera Ls situated as to give the 
viewers a shot of the main room of Jenni's 
apanment and never shuts down, revealing 
all of the goings-on of Jenni's life in that 
particular artta. 

The whole premise of ibe idea i\ to 
entertain as well as teach, for as any good 
anthropologist knows the best way to learn 
about a cuhure is to observe a member of it. 

The mam problem with this site is that it 
takes too long to re-load (20 minutes) for a 
person tbai isn't a member of the site. (In 
contrast, members get a new picture every 
two minutes ) Ocspite this, the concept is an 
amazing one. in my opinion. It's like a web- 
based "Tniman Show" of sorts. 

The aeM site was one I personally came 
up with while doing a search on one of my 
hobby inieresls ■■ parapsychology. While 



there is very little to do with para- 
psychology on this site, 
wv*w.best.ci)m/-gazis5aK/clly.hlml offers 
an eerie took at what some call Cemetery 
Culture, or what could best be described as 
being richly occult. 

The one pan of the site that I did find 
interesting (if not somewhat disrespectful) 
was "The Epitaph Browser" 

This section of the site was totally dedi- 
cated to epitaphs taken from actual tomb- 
stones around the world and arranged alpha- 
betically. 

Some epitaphs featured were celebrities 
such as famous women's rights worker 
Susan B. Anthony (whose epitaph reads 
"Liberty, Humanity, Justice, Equality") and 
common people such as Boston firework 
manufacturer Abe Bell (whose read. "He 
has gone to the only place where his own 
works are excelled.") This site, if you can 
tolerate it, is perfect for tho.sc nights alone 
when you're looking for a little scare. 



This final site, hltp://blg-gyanl- 
head .com/run/. 1 found rather amusing. It 
was full of entertaining downloads for the 
Windows 95 platform that adds a little 
humor to the desktop. 

One item available for download is the 
"Magic 8-BalI." Once you run this program, 
an eight ball appears next to the clock at the 
bottom of the screen that, when you drag 
your mouse over it, gives you a response in 
typical "Magic S-Ball" fashion. 

Another item available for download is 
a program called "Esheep" thai, when run, 
creates a litde sheep that roams all over your 
desktop area. 

You can 
drag it up and 
drop it wherev- 
er you like; but 
if you drop it 
too far, you 
may end up 



mess. This program is somewhat compatible 
with another of the downloads called "Go 
Postal" that allows you to "shoot up" your 
desktop in typical old west fashion, litis 
program is rather difficult to close, but il is 
fairly entertaining, especially on your more 
swcssed out days. 

Regardless of what one may find on the 
Internet, though, it can still be pretty enter- 
taining. 

As 1 always say, half the fun of finding 
something is the process of looking it up. 
You never know what you may find along 
the way. 



Faculty Spotlight: Robin Newman 



by Adam Taylor and Erica Dytr 



Features Editor and Staff Writer 

As the new school year starts, IPFW is welcoming in a new class of fresh- 
man, first lime students, returrung students, and new facuUy members. 

One such faculty member is the new direaor of the Center for Women 
and Returning Adults. 

Approximately a month ago, Robin E. Newman was added to the IPFW 
staff and assigned to head up the Center for Women and Returning Adults 

The Center, located in Walb G25, assists reluming adults as well as first 
time students over the traditional age of 22 in becoming better adjusted to the 
ever-changing IPFW campus. 

With this challenging task, the Center for Women and Returning AdulLs 
finds a competent, qualified director in Robin Newman. 

Newman attended Indiana State University in Terre Haute and received her 
masters degree in education from Oregon State University in Corvallis. 

After living in Oregon for ten years, she made the decision to move back 
to Indiana where her f^nily was located. 

The move proved to be a good one for Newman, since she met her hus- 
bwd here and really enjoys the community. She has three daughters that 
attend school locally, the youngest being two years old. 

When she's not working hard to make sure the Center for Women and 
Returning Adults is running smoothly, Newman enjoys bike riding with her 
three daughters. 

She and her husband are abo active in the community beyond work. 
They enjoy singing in a choir together and playing the guitar. They even 
recently played a solo at a friend's wedding. 

Before she came to IPFW. Newman worked as the vice president and dean 
of students at the University of St. Francis in Fort Wayne. While there she 
remained very active in the university and even helped organize die sch(K)l's 




first newspaper. 

Although her paper at Sl Francis 
wasn't quite as established as Ttiu 
Communicator was when she left St 
Francis, she feels as though il is well on 
its way to becoming so. 

Despite her succes.s at St. Francis, 
Newman docs not regret leaving there for 
IPFW. She says she loves it here and has 
"always wanted to work here." 

One of the many things she wani.s to 
stress to the students, however, is the 
importance of not only being students but 
becoming actively involved in the univer- 
sity in .some way or another on campus. 

She feels it is important to find a niche: something that will make us feel 
that we are pan of the conmiunity 

She does that herself by being involved in the IPFW mentoring program 
and recoiiunends odier students to do the same, in their own way 

Newman is already enjoying success as the new director of the Center for 
Women and Returning Adults. 

The Center recently completed the ASTRO program, designed to intro- 
duce reluming or new adults lo the IPFW campus. 

The program consisted of a series of workshops and tours provided for 
the alleviation of anxiety and stress one might face in a new environment. 

Of the 63 panicipanLs, all of them said they were glad they attended and 
Newman considered it a huge succe,s.s. 

If you should ever find yourself in Walb, be sure lo slop by the Center for 
Women and Returning Adults and .see what they have to offer in way of 
resources, books, tapes, and pamphlets while you're there.

New Science Building running successfully

The lobby of the new Science Building 



Science Building opened in lime for [he beginning of 

fall scmesier. 

Housing chemistry, geology, and biology, as well as 

other select courses, the builchng offers new types of 

technology and educational means to enhance leaniing. 
The building is great," student Joseph Frenizel 

said. "It's a little more proressional than Keider." 
Most of the classes now taught in the new building 

were at one time spread out among the floors of Keitlcr 
The new building offers advantages for all students. 
Computer screens as well as 
notes and photos can be pro- 
jected without the need of 
overhead sheets. 

Besides lecture technique 
advantages, the new labs are 
much safer than those previ- 
ously used in Kcnler where 
air ventilation systems were 
not designed spcciTically for a 
science building. 

■'Probably, number one 
(advantage), is safely, espe- 
cially in the chemistry labs." 
Michael Columbia, assistant 
professor of chemistry, said. 
'The layout is a lot safer, and 
we also have things that will 
accommodate people with 
disabilities." 

Besides benefits for the 
chemistry department, the 
biology department has also 
had benefiL'i due to relocation. 
"Most important, this is a 
teaching institution. We now 
have six teaching laboratories 
(before there were only four), 
said Frank Paladino, chair of 
the biology department. "It's a 
great enhancement. It gives us 
more flexibility with schedul- 
ing; we're servicing our stu- 
dents belter." 

The depanmeni of geo- 
sciences has set up two com- 
puters currently functioning 
on die first floor (just above 
the lobby) that show bow seis- 
mic waves propagate through 
the Earth, results of volcanic 
eruptions and earthquake 
sights from the 1960s to the 
present. 

The third computer, not yet 
running, will display die seis- 
mograms taken by the newly 
acquired seismograph, cour- 
lesy of the U.S. Geological 
Survey. 




Lecture Hall 168 in the new Science Building 



"A person will be able to sec a seismogram for an 
earthquake anywhere around the world," said Scon 
Argasi, chair of the department of geosciences. "Data 
received here (into IPFW's seismograph) would go into 
long-term studies," 

Directly to the right of the computers is a display of 
over 200 minerals, along with some samples of pure ele- 
ments, and a smaller display of the Stony meteorites, 
which date back 4,5 billion years, offering insight into 
die composition of the earth's mantle. 

"They (die displays) provide info that directly .sup- 
ports classroom material," Argast said, "It brings imme- 
diacy to die Iccti^re^maierial: you talk about a rock or 
mineral and diey cU go see il at anytime they want." 

Besides being functional for students in the build- 
ing. Argasi hopes dial all students, as well as the com- 



munity, can. find enjoyment and interest in the displays. 
"We hope that people that have an inierusi in the 
Earth will come by and see," Argasi said. "It's a small 
museum, really I diink that we have the best minenil 
and interactive display in town." 

There will also be a working ground water module 
near the elevator on the first fioor, however, like many 
portions of the new building, it is not yet complele and 
will be running in the near future. 

Even widi the building not yet complete, it offers 
much, to students and die community through enhanced 
lecnnology and the prospect of new educational iRSlJ),-, 
ods and displays.

Summer sports wrap up: What you have missed 



What is going on with the Bulls and the NBA for that matter? What is all this 
baseball stuff, Yankees best team ever? Maris who? and how 'bout them Cubbies 



Staff Writer 

Aaaahhhh summer: a lime to gel off 
your buic and enjoy ihe nice weather while 
it lasL'.. 

Even Ihe die-hard spoiv^ fans can lake a 
brealc from channel surfing. 

When your choices consisi of PGA 
Golf. NASCAR, and the WNBA, the greai 
outdoors appears lo be Lbe only logical alier- 
naiivc. 

So, if you've been away from the spons 
scene, here are a few of ihc summer's high- 
lights- 

No Bull 

After winning their third straight cham- 
pionship, and sixth in the last eight seasons, 
the Chicago Bulls dynasty looks as if it has 
come to an end. 

Head Coach Phil Jackson, staying true 
to his word, rode his Harley oul of Chicago 
and into the beautiful Montana sunset. 
Thus, the Bulls future remains unclear. 

Will Michael play for new coach Tim 
Floyd? Will Pippen return, even if MJ 
does? Will Rodnian ever win an Academy 
Award? 

NBA Lockout 

Since Ihe players arc currently locked 
out, none of these questions (except 
Rodman's) will be answered until the play- 
ers union and owners can hammer oul a new 
collective bargaining agreement. 

Based on lililc progress in early negoti- 
ations, the NBA may lose regular season 
games for Ihe first time in league history. 

Three notes to the NBA: 1) Football 
starts Sunday, with baseball playoffs fol- 
lowing soon after. 




2) Fans will not sympathize with either 
billionaire owners or multi-millionaire play- 
ers fighting over who gets more money 

3)Keep in mind how badly ba.scball suf- 
fered after canceling die 1994 World Series. 
It took major renovations and records that 
needed to be broken. I don't think any one 
will ever score 100 points in a game again 
and I don't think losing "Air Jordan" will 
help smiations either. 



Baseball Renaissance 



It has been four year^ since baseball's 
attempted suicide, and only now are fans 
beginning to return lo the ballpark. 

This season has had many compelling 
stories that are direaly responsible for the 
renewed interest in baseball, whether it be 
the Yankees and their successful run 
throughout diis season or all of the transac- 



tions thai have made baseball as interesting 
as ever before. And whai about those 
McGwire and Sosa guys? Aren't they doing 
something? And how 'bout them Cubbies. 
Harry sure would be proud. 

The Greatest Team 

The New York Yankees are not only Ihe 
best team in baseball this year, but they are 



threatening to shaltet the all-time record for 
wins in a season: a record that many feel 
would be irrelevant if they fail to win the 
World Series. 

Aside from the Yankees, Ihc balance of 
power is evenly distributed between Boston. 
Cleveland. Atlanta. San Diego, and with the 
acquisition of Randy Johnson, now 
Houston. 

As last season's "rent-a-championship," 
Rorida Marlins proved, anything can hap- 
pen in a seven-game scries. 

The bad news for Yankees fans: their 
record over playoff contenders is barely 
over .500. 

The Chase 

The chase for former Yankee Roger 
Maris' home run record is in full swing. 
While Ken Griffey Jr has fallen oul of con- 
leniion. the Cardinals' Mark McGwire arid 
the Cubs' SaiTuny Sosa have caught fire as 
of late. 

In the first week of Seplember. Dig Mac 
is sitting on 57 and Sosa is right behind at 
55, 

Maris' record of 61 looks vulnerable, 
but as the record nears these sluggers will 
see fewer good pilches to hii. 

No pitcher wants to be the answer to the 
trivia question. Who gave up homer *(62? 
But then again who wants to be the pitcher 
to walk McGwire on bis last at bat for 62! 

Lovable Losers? 

In addition to Sosa's accomplishments, 
the Cubs have quiedy stayed in the playoff 
hunt and are virtually even with die New 
York Mets and the San Francisco Giants for 
the final playoff spot in the N.L. League, 

However, don't get too excited Cubs 
fans, because I don't think they have what it 
takes to beat eidicr die Astros, Braves, or 
Padres in a seven-game series. But hey it's 
a start!

sive mid-fielder James Ryland, a 
sophomore liansfcr from Easiem 
Illinois. 

The new guys should give die 
Dons the perfect combination of 
quickness and aggressiveness 
which will work real well with 
reiuming offensive threats Malt 
Hein and Danny Perez. 

Hein, a mid-fielder from 
Omaha, Neb., made the regional 
team last year for Division I and 
was invited lo iry out for ihc nation- 
al team. 

Perez, a senior from Madrid 
Spain, is a huge scorer for die Dons. 
At the present time Perez is over- 
coming a sprained ankle which 
should be healed in time for Labor 
Day. 

The Dons have a strong defen- 
sive squad reiuming with senior 
Adam Strack of Homestead High 
School, junior Dave Smith from 
Elkhart and .sophomores Kevin
