Whether we avoid it or not,

approach I used when facing sonic-

group dynamics. 



Recently, I had the unfortu-

left feeling uncomfortable, not only 
about the situation at hand, but also 
about the fact ihat my friends were 
potentially jeopardizing their rela-

The lifestyle and habit was unat-

old ones. While some choices seem 
obvious, it's always more of a chal-

selves from within our groove and

times change is necessary. 

Ultimately, 1 didn't want to throw 
away friendships that I had spent 
time developing- Anything you put

A group of people will always

hard tiling is realizing when it's time

thi-- thought careful analysis before 
jumping to a conclusion. Not only 
are there natural factors that we must 
take into effect, but there are also 
man-made factors, and I'm not just 
talking cops and robbers here. While 
criminals love summer for their own 
reasons, it is mostly because of hu- 
man error that we must be careful. 

So here are my tips tor things to 
watch out for: 

1. Every summer we hear 
about tons of people who cither end 
up injuring themselves, burning 



down a house or accidentally calch- 
ing someone on lire because of fire- 
works. If I can offer you one piece 
of advicc--don't be that idiot. It isn't 
terribly iliflicuh lo use common sense 
and precaution is It? 

Now I know we all gel excited 
when we see sparkly things in the .or 
or on the ground, but come on, just let 
someone else make that mistake and 
spare yourself the embarrassment. 

2. My next qualm with summer- 
time is sunburns. Again, don't be that 
fool. I'm all about a nice tan, don't get 
me wronjj, but when you see the guy 
walking around like a lobster, don't 
you just want to go up and slap him 
on his burns? Jeez, if he just would 
have put on some sunscreen, he- 
would have been fine. Not only that, 
but it would cut down on the amount 
ol money he has to spend on aloe vera 



for the rest of the month And then we it's lots .it Inn. and soon they'll forget

3. Pools and other bodies of water, on your bug spray, people!

To be big, 

Start small 



Said Said Something 
again 

By Said El-Dajani 



While trying to a build a business 
during one year of my life I was re- 
petitively lokl to think big and dream

Even though I may not have been 
ready to commit to a business at the 
time 1 pursued it, I realized that I 
wauled to learn as much as I could to 
be prepared tor whatever endeavors 
came my way. The biggest problem 1 
found with thinking big was starling 
big whereas building a foundation 
and. developing a process usually is 
more effective. 

After graduating high school. 
I took the initial route of' attending 
Purdue Universal) in West Lafayette. 
1 thought the transition to indepen- 
dence would be smooth, I was look- 
ing forward to being on my own, 
making my own decisions, and more 
importantly, building an academic fu- 
ture thai would carry me on to a lifc-

complemented my lifestyle and no! would be the key to a wonderful job. 

the other way around, I left realizing By the time I left Purdue, I knew I 

that 1 was starting too big. didn't want a job. 

I decided IPFW would be a bet- A job to me means that you are 

ter school at which to start small. I doing something thai you have to do 

came back home and lived with my instead dome something you want to

So I got what I wanted!

right at home The city thai I found 
disgusting a year and a halt" earlier 
was finally com fort able. The school 
I thought to be less superior was ex- 
actly what I was looking for. 

While in the past IPFW would not 
have been a first choice, the reality is 
that this university has a lot lo offer to 
people looking lo do something big 

Graduating high school I had the

Advice for incomming freshman 



Welcome Freshmen! Some of 
you are on this campus by your own 
decisions, and the rest of you are not. 
But don't be discouraged just because 
you aren't on a big campus with the 
rest of your friends. IPFW is a great 
school and you will all enjoy your 
time here if you let your self. So, I 
am going to give you some advice so 
that you may enjoy your time here as 
much as 1 did. 

First of all, get -involved with 
something, anything, whether it 
is your major's club or intramural 
sports. Getting involved will link 
you to other people and eventually 
you will become acquainted with 
many other people who will become 
long lasting friends. When you have 
friends, anything is bearable. 

Secondly, get to know your pro- 
fessors! If you take the time to get 10 
know your professors they will gel to 
know you, making the trips to their 
office lo ask questions much easier. 
Also, I have always found that ihe 
more I talked lo m\ professor the bet- 
ter 1 wanted to do, I didn't want to let 
them down by failing. 

Third, take advantage of every- 
thing I PFW offers you, from the Writ- 
ing Center to CASA. These centers 
an: here to help you succeed, because 
lhat is what you deserve. If you feel 
like you arc struggling, stop by one 
of these places and the friendly stall 
would love to help you out. There 
is no reason to do poorly in a class 
with all the resources around to as- 

Also. use common sense when 
it conies to making decisions about 
class. Don't show up late to class 
everyday. Because, I, it is disre- 
spectful lo your instructor and your 
classmates, and 2, you often miss 
,.11) announcements or important in- 
formation regarding the class. It is 
understandable if you are late a few 
limes .1 semester but registering for a 
class that you just cannot make it to 
on time is not a wise decision. Fur- 
ther, don't be thai person who fails 
his class because you skipped too 
many days. This is avoidable as long 
as you slay in good communication 
with your instructor. These people 
are here 10 help you, so use them. 

Lastly, consult your advisor. I 
know this is probabl) really repetitive 



to you, because you've heard it so 
many times before. If you have any 
questions ask them. You don't want 
10 go through a whole semester of the 
wrong classes or just simply have a 
misunderstanding of something. 



ill likely be set up for success and 
ill more likely enjoy your time on 
e IPFW campus. Have a wonder-
