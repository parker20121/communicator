Professor has own theory 
on disappearing lake 



ByMary Shrock 
Staff Writer 

Solomon Isiorho, assistant pro- 
fessor of geology, takes great 
interest in a lake thai, by all out- 
ward appearance, is shrinking. 

During his doctoral program at 
Case Western Reserve Universi- 
ty, Isiorho began research on 
Lake Chad, located in Nordiem 
Africa. 

Isiorho, who is himself from 
Nigeria, said he became interest- 
ed in Lake Chad while living in 
Africa. "I was there during one 
of the droughts. Being from thai 
pan of ihe world, I Ihoughl thai 
would be a good research pro- 
ject," he said, 

Isiorho, a hydrogcologist, as 
well as a professor, found that 
underneath Lake Chad, a layer 
of bedrock was absorbing huge 
amounts of water. The people 
living off the water of Lake 
Chad Ixilieved iheir water supply 
was disappearing forever. 

Isiorbo's research supports the 
idea that Lake Chad's water is 
underground, and not merely 
evaporating. He said this is 
because the lake's water is fresh, 



not salt. Lakes located in seini- 
arid areas should collect salt, 
according to Isiorho, but Lake 
Chad's water remains fresh, 

Isiorho said the salt must be 
going somewhere, and if he can 
find out where, he said it's possi- 
ble he can Imd where the water 
has gone as well. 

Critics who warn against the 
dangers of depleting the new 
found source of water don't wor- 
ry Isiorho who said, "We need 
information, so we can manage 
our resources, and I think we 
jusi have to be responsible for 
whatever resources we have." 

Isiorho went on to say, "If we 
are going to have a sustainable 
environment we need to know 
what resources we have—noi just 
for the present generations but 
for the future. 

For those students witli a great 
sense of ailvenlure. and enough 
money for travel, Isiorho is tak- 
ing anodier trip to Africa in July 
and welcomes any help with his 
project. Contact Solomon 
Isiorho at the Geology Deparl- 
ment in Kelller Hall if you arc 
interested. 



in hiring practices and require- 
ments among the four agencies 
as a source of conflict for the 
consortium agencies. 

Parkview has taken over man- 
agement of the EduCare Center, 
Adair said, and will hold it until 
a decision can be reached 
behvcen the four member- agen- 
cies on how to run the center sat- 
isfactorily. 

In other senate news, the sec- 
ond senator in as many weeks 
resigned, leaving the number of 
active senators in the senate at 



14. Rhonda McCrary resigned 
her position as senator at the 

meeting, citing time constraints 
as her reason for leaving. 

MeCrary's departure vacated a 
seat on the campus organizations 
committee. Vice president of 
legislation, John Weisenburger, 
appointed senator Elbert Web- 
ster to the vacated position. 

A Campus Appeals Board 
hearing on the impeachment of 
student senator Nancy Barger 
will be held Monday, March 16. 
according to Evangelos 



Coufoudakis, appeals board 
chair. 

Adair reported lo the senate 
that a full chronology of the 
events leading up lo accusadons 
of impropriety against Barger 
has been submitted to 
Coufoudakis. 

Barger is charged with making 
false accusations of misconduct 
against a student petitioning for 
a seat on ihe student senate. 

The next student senate meeting 
will be Feb. 28 at 3 p.m. in Walb 
Memorial Union. Room 114. 



University uses associate 
professors to cut costs 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Features Editor 

IPFW is dealing with increased 
enrollment and skyrocketing cam- 
pus operating costs by employing 
part-time professors at low 
salaries, according to David 
McCuits, vice chancellor for aca- 
demic affairs. 

"There arc many options," said 
McCants. "Some ways to reduce 
campus costs coutd be increased 
class sizes so we need fewer pro- 
fessors, we could offer fewer 
courses and programs, or we could 
reduce salaries of employees. " 
McCants suggested. 

McCants said that students may 
not like Ihe implementation of 
those options, so the campus is 
using part-time associate faculty 
members who arc paid low wages. 

"Our rehance on part-lime facul- 
ty is growing. Many universities 
rely heavily on part-time faculty, 
and we arc no diffcrcnl. We 
depend on them to meet staffing 
needs and lo give high quality 
teaching services." tic said. 

According lo McCanls. the asso- 
ciate faculty are part-time profes- 
sors who often have full-time jobs 
in addition 10 leaching. 

Frederick Kiichhoff. cbilr of the 
English and linguistic deparlmenl, 
said (he associate faculty members 
are distinctly different from full- 
time professors. He said fuU-timc 
professors arc called on to serve on 
committees, participate in board 
meetings, and conduct research. 

"These are important differences 
t&gt;ccause the associate faculty mem- 
ber is only concerned wiih teach- 
ing. There is also a difference in 
the credentials Ihey are required lo 
have," K ire hhoff said. 

McCants said the requirements 
for associate faculty and full-lime 
professors differ from department 
to department. In some depart- 
ments, he said, the associate facul- 
ty member needs a bachelor's 
degree, and in other cases Ihey 
need to be acknowledged as a pro- 
fessional in their field. 

Anson Shupc, professor of 
anthropology and sociology, said 
in a commentary printed in Ihe 
Journal- Gazelle, that associate fac- 
ulty members ( 



IPFW offers study tour of Rome in May 



By Mike Wade 
News Editor 

The IPFW department of civil 
and archiieclural engineering 
technology is sponsoring a 14- 
day study lour of Rome. 

Students may enroll in ihc 
course for three credits, or audit 
the course for no credit 

The course is open to all stu- 
dents and has no prerequisites. 

Participants will visit such as 
the Colosseum, the Pantheon. 
the Vatican, St Peter's Square, 
and Rome's medieval churches. 

Matthew Kubic. professor of 
civil and architectural engineer- 
ing, developed the study in con- 
junction with ihc continuing 
education program at Purdue - 
West Lafayette. 

"This is a fairly unique situa- 
tion because this is the fint time 
dial Purdue - West Lafayette has 
developed such a course with 
faculty from a regional campus," 
said Kubic. 

"I feel like we are breaking 
ground with the extension of 
West Lafayette services lo a 



regional campus," continued 
Kubic, 

Students enrolled in the course 
for credit will be expected to 
attend a one-day prc-tour semi- 
nar and complete pre-iour essays 
and readings, according to 
Kubic, 

In addition, students enrolled 
for credit will be required to 
keep a journal or sketch book 
and complete a post-tour 
research paper, said Kubic. 

The travel costs for the tour 
will be S2040. These costs will 
cover round-trip airfare from 
Chicago to Rome, ground trans- 
portation from West Lafayette lo 
Chicago, lodging in the three- 
star hotels with private facilities, 
and all breakfasts. 

The tuition fees for Ihc class 
arc S2S0,50 for Indiana residents 
and S733.50 for non-residents, 

A S200 deposit is required to 
reserve space on the lour and is 
due by March 10, The lour bal- 
ance, $1840, is due April 3. and 
die tuition fee is due April 30. 

Kubic will be the primary 



insOTJCior for the course. Kubic 
studied architecture while hving 
in London and Rome, and has 
completed post-graduate studies 
in Roman history. 

The tour assisiani will be Portia 
Prebys. director of the Rome 
program for St Mary's College, 
Prebys specializes in Iiahan his- 
tory, culture and language. 

According to Kubic. Prebys 
lived in Italy for 23 years and 
will enhance with ihc tour's edu- 
cational opportunity. 

Kubic said, bodi he and Prebys 
have had experience in Rome, so 
the students won't be following 
around lour leaders who don't 
know where ihcy arc. 

Kubic hopes that the course 
will upgrade the education of 
IPFW's architecture students. 

"This was an effort lo expand 
the opportunities for our archi- 
tecture students and give them 
the lype of experience that they 
would gel through some other 
architectural programs," said 
Kiibic. 



problems. The commentary said 
some problems part-time faculty 
face are "miserly" wages given on 
a semester-lo-scmester basis, 
denial of dignity accorded "real 
professors," and a lack of insur- 
ance or retirement benefits. 

"This is a nasty, undcipublici/cd 
problem, tlnivcrsity officials may 
offer any number of excuses, but 
the blatant fact is thai a large pro- 
portion of essential courses arc 
taught by grossly underpaid, 
moonlighting inslruclors." he 

McCanls agreed that part-time 
professors are underpaid. He said 
the university meets the demands 
of financial cutbacks by "hiring 
people at very modest rates." He 
also said that the number of part- 
time professors is rising. IPFW 
had 334 full-time professors and 
333 associate faculty as of Fall 
1991. 

"As long as the person 
knows how to communi- 
cate and talk in front of 
people, and how to explain 
things and make them 
interesting, then I don't see 
a problem with using part- 
time professors. " 
-Kerry Hubartt 

A likely salary tor an associate 
faculty member, McCants said, 
would range from S1200 to S1500 
per three-credit class. Parl-limc 
faculty arc restricted to leaching a 
maximum of three courses per 
semester; and they are not eligible 
to receive benefits. 

Other disadvantages for associate 
faculty members, according to 
Shupc's. commentary arc office 
space and office hours. He said 
that part-time faculty generally 
have no offices at all and find it 
difficult to meet with students out- 
side of class. 

On the other hand, Kerry 
Hubartt, an associate faculty mem- 
ber in the journalism department, 
said that he has encountered mini- 
mal problems. 

"I have had problems in the past 
with office space and student 
meetings because of a lack of 



lOom. But this semester I really 
don't have those problems because 
of Ihc nature of my class. My stu- 
dents know how lo gel in touch 
with me. and Fm available before 
and after class," Hubartt said. 

Shupc said Ihe stigma of not 
being a "real professor" may cause 
problems for the students' educa- 
tion. Shupe's commeniury slates 
that part-time professors "are sec- 
ond-class academics," 

Kirchhoff disagreed saying that 
some of Ihe parl-iimc faculty are 
better teachers than full-time pro- 

Diniclle Shearer, an EngUsh stu- 
dent, said she has had only positive 
experiences with associate faulty 
members. "They offer good expe- 
riences because they're actually in 
that field of work." 

Another question Shupc asked 
was why the part-time faculty tol- 
erate being "used poorly by the 
.system," He suggested some asso- 
ciate faculiy members want the 
leaching experience, others like 
contributing to Ihe commtmily, and 
some are economically desperate 
and moonlight at various institu- 
tions to moke financial ends meet 

Hubartt said he volunteered lo 
leach at IPFW because he want- 
ed to teach, and t)ccuuse there is 
a consisteni need for part-time 
faculty. 

"As long as Ihe person knows 
how lo communicate, and talk in 
front of people, and how lo explain 
things and make them interesting, 
then I don't see a problem wilh 
using part-time professors," 
Hubarli explained. 

McCants said as the siudenl pop- 
ulation continues to increase, the 
demand for part-time faculty will 

To help solve these problems. 
Kichhoff would like lo improve 
die financial situation of port-limo 
faculty, but he said the university 
budget is just not large enough. 

Shupe suggested drastic mea- 
sures to get immediate results. He 
said, "Perhaps an institutional 
shakeup is due. Organized work- 
stoppage or faculty unionization, 
anyone?"

Conservative Buchanan is 
helping Hberal foes 



There's a lol of irony in what Pal Buchanan is 
doing. 

The conservative Republican candidate used 
cunning attacks on George Bush's broken 
promises and on Bush's stand- for-nothing poli- 
tics to take a moral victory in the New Hamp- 
shire primary. 

By showing so strongly in New Hampshire, 
Buchanan has ironicaily helped the Democrats 
whose libera] politics he so strongly despises. 

On the campaign nail, Buchanan has used neg- 
ative adverlisemenls and pointed jabs to make 
Bush look like an ass. All the while, the 
Democrats have been able to focus on other 
issues. 

Paul Tsongas has plenty of lime to tell us he 
isn't "Santa Claus" because he doesn't have lo 
talk about Bush, Bill Clinton can concentrate on 
clearing his stained name because he doesn't 
have to say what Bush has done wrong, Jerry 
Brown can get his "We the People" message out 
because he doesn't have to lell us why Bush 
slinks. 

Buchanan, on the other hand, does little but 
challenge the president. Buchanan has a com- 
mercial that features Busb on video, delivering 
die now famous "Read my lips, no new taxes" 
promise. 

Buchanan also was quick to tell New Hamp- 
shire voters about how little Bush cares about 
their economic needs. "Send George Bush a 
message," Buchanan told vowfs before the pri- 
mary last week. H ];■■■' • 

And they did. Buchanilftook an amazing 40 
percent of the votes in the primary. A Bush cam- 
paign aide told the Washington Post that ibe 
New Hampshire message was "a 2-by-4 across 
the front of (he face and head." 

But Buchanan isn't going to get the G.O.P. 
nominaiion. He's never held public office and he 



holds little respect in the party. 

Last Friday. Buchanan was stifled by Republi- 
can party leaders in South Carolina. Bush was 
given time al a G.O.P. meeting but Buchanan 
was not. Buchanan ended up stuck in a traffic 
jam caused by Bush's motorcade. 

Along with his problem with a lack of party 
respect, Buchanan is an easy target. He's been 
accused of slurring gays, immigrants, blacks and 
Jews in newspaper columns he wrote in die pa.si. 
He stands for "America-First" isolationism and 
racist "Naiivism." 

Right now Bush has Dan Quayle out to rip on 
Buchanan. Even Quayle may be able lo put in a 
painful word or two. 

That is if Bush will attack Buchanan for being 
against gays and minorities. Bush himself has 
never been known as a champion for civil rights. 

Regardless, Buchanan can't win. So what he 
can do is help the Democrats. The New Hamp- 
shire showing has already shown Bush as weak, 
and this may open the door for some new Demo- 
cratic candidates to enter the race. 

There's been talk, according to the Washington 
Post, that House Majority Leader Richard 
Gephardt, D-Mo., may run. 

New 1'ork Governor Mario Cuomo is still a 
possible candidate and Senator Lloyd Benlsen, 
D-Texas, has "not closed the door." according to 
one of his associates. Even Jesse Jackson is con- 
sidering arelum of the Rainbow Coalition. . ., 

Even if ■voters are left io choose between the 
winner ofthe current Democratic field and Susli, 
come November 3 Bush will be much weaker for 
that race, thanks to Buchanan, 

Maybe down deep Buchanan craves a liberal 
Democratic president to complain about next 
season on Crossfire. Even if that isn't Buchanan'.s 
intention with his campaign, it may be the result. 




This election offers some good 



reasons to vote 

ByK.L.CarafT 
Staff Writer 

Somewhere in my head. I carry around a list 
diat could be tided: "Things 1 ought to do but 
am too lazy or indifferent lo accomplish." Writ- 
ing thank-you notes on time and returning 
library books arc at the top of ihat list Cleaning 
the heating register is at the very bottom. 
There's a whole lot of embarrassing stuff in 
between. 

I'm proud to say, however, thai remembering to 
vote during presidential elections isn't on that 
list. (Okay, sometimes remembering to vote 
during die "off-year" local primaries gets there. 
It's somewhere between picking up clothes from 
the dry cleaners and getting a physical.) 

Every four years since I turned 18, I've cast my 
vote for a losing candidate. Thank God I can 
look back and say, "1 did my best as a citizen to 
avoid this current economic debacle. It was 
everybody else's fault," In 1980, Carter got my 
vote; in 1984, Mondale was my man; and in 
1988 1 was not fooled by Bush's WUlie Honon 
advenisements. In short, I may have a weakness 
for underdogs and losers, but I tried, in my own 
small way, to make what 1 thought was a change 
for the better, or, to be more precise, avoid dis- 
aster.

This year. I'm once again planning to vole and 
I think this may well be the most important elec- 
tion I've yet taken part in. The economy, educa- 
tion and Ihe environment are in critical need of 
attention. Our next president will have lo be the 
one to do die job. 

That's why I'm urging every reader to cast her 
ballot, I know, you've probably heard or read 
lots of "good citi2£n" smff before, and it's most 
likely getting dreary by now. But this is the year 
no eligible voter should avoid her duty. 

Just think of the issues at hand. Besides die 
three "Big E's" listed above, diere's the question 
of what to do to about the struggling American 
family, AIDS, drugs, crime, and abortion. 1 have 
a friend who will only vote for a pro-life candi- 
date. I have others who will only vote for a pro- 
choice candidate. By voting their beliefs, they 
are demonstrating the power of their commit- 
ment. There's plenty to get passionate about. 

Find your passion(s) and vote your hearts and 
minds. To those of you already exercising your 
right to vote, keep it up. And do your best to 
help our numbers grow.

Letters TO The Editor 



Please do not meddle in women's choices 



To the Editor: 

Like my colleague, Jeanette 
Clausen, 1 am equally appalled 
to see no! one single letter in 
support of Chad nesting's 
tlioughtfully deuiiled position on 
Ihe trying issue of abortion. 
Instead, an avalanche of abusrd 
arguments has been filling The 
Communicaior ever since. 

You "holy" people out there - 
do you think there is a single 
person on this planet who is 
killing die unborn? Are you so 
blind in your self-righteousness 
diJit;}(t&gt;H ;dp.l'l gfiisp diat'ii may 



actually be more humane in 
deeply desperate situations for 
the unwanted fetus to be aborted 
at an early stage so that it may 
be spared a life of pain, hunger, 
neglect, and abuse which is 
beyond its control? 
Doesn't your heart go out to 
neglected children who are at the 
mercy of uncaring parents pr 
strangers, who suffering unjust- 
ly, like the children bom in the 
wake of Ccausescu's ban on 
abortion? Don't those most 
recent horror stories alert you to 
the face that every baby born 



onto this planet has a right not 
just to life, but to a life free of 
pain and hugcr, nurtured by 

love? 

Arc you committed to taking 

care of those suffering children 
after they are born? If yes, 1 
applaud you; if no, please, do 
not meddle anymore in women's 
choices - what they do or don't 
do concerns them alone and is 
none of your business. 

If you arc so "pro-life", why 
not invest your energy in the liv- 
ing, by caring for the millions of 



victims of war, famine, eco- 
nomics, and religion and thereby 
ensuring their right lo life. I 
think it is irresponsible of you to 
continue to inflict your opnions 
on diose who are less fortumaie 
than you. by taking leisurely 
walks in pro-Ufe marches and by 
sitting smugly in front of abor- 
tion clinics bothering paiients, 
thus showing us sinners how 
good the Lord has made you.

Column ignored many good Christian charities 



To the Editor: 

Chad Hesling, you are truly 
amazing. Or, perhaps, visible 
Christianity caused chaos in 
your mind. You stood on a Fort 
Wayne street corner on a Sunday 
and watched a parade that 
occurred on Saturday. And then 
you were able to directly quote, 
in the first paragraph of your 
Jan. 30 editorial, each of the 
4,500 non-picketers of tlie Wom- 
en's Health Organization Clinic, 
as well as the 500 people you 
lecognized as pickeiers. In die 
name of science, did they really 
tell you thai life begins ihe day 
after conception? Do you die 
the day before your brain ceases 



to function? So much for your 

journalistic aedibility. 
1 suggest you do some research 

on Christianity in Fort Wayne, 

Maybe you should start by ask- 
ing the homeless men in Ihe park 
beside the clinic if they had 
lunch at Si. Mary's soup kitchen, 
if they slept the night before at 
the Fon Wayne Rescue Mission, 
if perhaps their clothing was 
supplied by St. Mary's Free 
Store or the Salvation Army, if 
dieir last headache or toothache 
was eased by volunteers at 
Matdiew 25 Free Clinic, if they 
asked Miss Virginia for a warm 
blanket, or if they know any of 
the homeless families who live 



al Vincent House. 

Maybe you could suggest that 
these homeless men call 
Cadiolic or Lutheran Social Ser- 
vices or the St. Vincent de Paul 
Society for immediaic and 
longieim assistants. Of course, 
these any many more services 
arc supported by Christians who 
dig deep into their pay- 
envelopes each week to help 
those in need. Incidentally, 
when was the last time you made 
a substantial monetary contribu- 
tion to any cause? 

Do not suppose that pro-lifers 
are single-minded. Life al its 
greatest potential is what these 
people are "for." If you want to 



know what a Chrisinin thinks, 
ask a Christian. If you want to 
write about the teachings and 
beliefs of the Roman CailioUc 
Church, you are most welcome 
to come to church and hsten to 
the message. 
Chad, please, for the sake of 
your sensibiUties, don't gel sick or 
injured in Fort Wayne. You may 
end up-God forhid-overwhelmed 
by Christian atmosphere al cidier 
Lutheran Hospital. St. Joseph 
Medical Center, or Parkview Hos- 
pital. God bless you, despite your 
chaotic befuddlcdness.

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Hesting 'shoddy' journalist 



Tci lliL- Kdlfor: 
1 am a junior uansfcr philosophy major 
enjoying my first scmeslcf of conunuling 
bliss here in Fori Wayne. Ihus I really 
don'i know ir anyone realty reads (his 
paper ot nol. bui jusi in case I wont lo 
make sure Ibai Mr, Hcsiing's commentary 
on (he March for UTe in [he Jan. 30 issue 
docs not go unnoticed. 

Mr, Hcsling, I have never before seen 
an oriicle full of more false accusaiioiis, 
political diarThca. and illogical innuendo 
than the one you cntiUcJ "Pro-lifcis guilty 
ot creating chaos." 1 was personally 
offended because 1 parlicipalcd in this 
march and your commentary told me Ihal 
I am someone I am not. As a moitcr of 
fad, the group of people you spoke of 
docs nol exist. You, Mr. Hestine, are 
guilty of shoddy, unrcsearched. poorly 
reasoned joumntism and are a disgrace lo 
your editorial staff and the media in gen- 

Lcl me respond poini by point. 

1. "Anti-aborlion aclivists stopped 
trjfric." Arc you pointing out a problem 
you have wilb firsi amendment righls lo 
public prolesl? Was Mailin Luther King 
wrong because he slopped traffic? (Not lo 
mention that the march this year took 
place during a snow advisory.) 

2. "Slopping Ihc embryo's progress is 
murder." Your article would have done a 
lot more real good for your position it you 



had at least attempted lo debunk this pro- 
life premise. Instead of dealing with 
things inleltcclually you spent the icsl of 
your article randomly inventing mean pro- 
lifers. Why avoid Ihc issue? 

3. "March for Life separate from 
N.E.I.R. laughnble." Your suggestion that 
because 1 out of 10 people allcnding were 
involved with N.E.I.R. means March for 
Life is N.E.I.R. is laughable. Who cares 
anyway. 

4. "Same people who nearly pushed 
over Janet Bradbury." Mr. Hcsling, you 
are welcome to come over to my house 
for lea anytime and we can then walch the 
news clip of Janet Bradbury, against the 
wishes of the fire marshal on hand, Irylng 
to walk over passive people who were sil- 
ling on ihcir knees. To write that she was 
pushed was a deliberate distortion of his- 
lorical fact. 

5. "Wendell Brane punched female 
escort." This is a mere story that was fab- 
ricated by the escorts in an aliempl to ral- 
ly support. The 'accusation was nol vcri- 
Tied by the video tape and Wendell was 
never corvic led for batlery. 

6. "Yelled 'fool.' 'slul.' -son of a 
bitch.' 'murderer'." I've been active in 
the Fori Wayne pro-life movement for six 
years. I've heard pro-lifers who might on 
occasion sing their hymns a bit loud or 
even pray a bit self-righleou.';ly. Howev- 
er, no one has ever yelled any of those 



things al a clinic patient. You're dream- 
ing. 

7. "Catholics. Protestants, pro-lifers 
only care about abortion," This is the 
most annganl and fallacious pari of your 
"commentary." Have you ever heard ot 
St. Mary's soup kitchen? How about Ihc 
Rescue Mission? Do you know of the 
work Broadway Christian Church docs 
with the poor and the sick? Did you know 
that the Fori Wayne Crisis Pregnancy 
Center can provide clothing, shelter, baby 
supplies, training, cic. to expectant moth- 
ers? Are you so blind Ihat you haven't 
seen pro-lifers reaching out lo the home- 
less in the park nexi to the clinic? What 
do you do for those homeless lhal you 
walk by every lime you go lo Ihc library? 
Don't lell mc who doesn't sacrifice, or 
who isn't compassionate. Are you ready 
to compare side by side those who do 
believe ours is a moral universe and those 
who don'l on the criteria of their core for 
Ihc less foriunalc. I'll be belting on the 
Catholic. Ihc Protestant and the pro-life. 

In the future I'll be hoping for more 
accurate and well-reasoned "cominen- 
lary" Mayl&gt;c you could star! by defend- 
ing the legality ot killing a unique human 
being wilh its owji genetic code, brain 
waves, heart beat, and sensory percep- 



Pro-choice column is 'idiotic' 



'Beauty pageant bimbo' 

Victim is unworthy of recourse 



To Ihe Ed I lor: 

Once again your bleeding-licarl 
stance hits cast a long shadow of con- 
fusion over iliis campus. Of course, I 
am not personally surpristxJ, this seems 
to be the basic premise of opefation for 
iliis kinda-sona-might-be-a-real-paper- 
somcday. 

Let us look ai rape. Yes. I agree it 
is a violent and traumatic event, il 
adversely affects the victim and diose 
that are close in their lives. However, 
there must be a line drawn as to 
actount-ibiliiy of action. Shoultl we 
feel badly for some beauty pageant 
bimbo who places herself in a situation 
[hat is dangerous at besi? 

Mike Tyson has a long standing 
repuLilion as being one that has lillle 
or no regard for women in general, 
Knowing (his. would a living being 
with any amount of inielligence place 
themselves in a hotel room at 4 in the 
morning with this idiot and expect to 
discuss ancient China, or maybe a 
lengthy exchange of ideas on individu- 
al rights and freedoms. Nol! 

Therefore I personally feel ihai this 
bimbo queen has no logical recourse in 
the judicial system. If I were lo have a 
liide slumber party with Charlie Man- 
son and I lose my head while sleep- 
ing, would I be the recipient of sympa- 
thy. I don't think so. 

Sure, the law says all people have a 
right to security, but that also means 
dial we should use our head. If a white

To Ihe Editor; 

Where do I begin to redirect the fab- 
rications of one so-called comraeniaiy 
by Chad Hesting, whose writing abili- 
ties frankly do not belong in any publi- 
cation meant for public consumption.? 
There is no need for personal animosi- 
ty, though, because there arc much 
more important issues lo deal wilh oth- 
, er ihan the garble of a liberal, secular 
humanist, anti-Christian, die-cast of 
Faye Waitleion. junkie columnist. 

The real issue is that once again 
pro-lifers, as well as Christians, are pui 
on the defensive by The Communica- 
tor. They musi defend ihemselves 
against certain managing editors who 
believe their opinion lo be the undis- 
puiable fact. Whatever happened to 
freedom of choice? Where is the free- 
dom of choice to be pro-life without 
suffering scrutiny and damaging lies 
from the Fori Wayne Feminists or oth- 
er ulira-liberals. 

The first issue I would like lo take 
up with Chad Hesting is the cartoon at 
the lop of the commentary page. 
Although a cute depiction of some- 
one's vivid imagination, it is laced 
with perjury. For one. the lady wilh 
the blinders holds a remarkable like- 
ness to Molly Yard. Has she seaeUy 
turned pro-life? For another, there are 
a good many Christians out working 
for the causes that you described, 
homelessness, AIDS, and child abuse; 
and for you to underrate ihose efforts 
thai are being made is detestable. 

Now in regards to your article, 
while you were remembering every 
face you ever saw march at the cbtiic 
downtown well enough to sec one of

them in every 10 marching in the 
March for Life, a memory of magnifi- 
ceni proportions which I find highly 
unlikely, you were still too unobser- 
vani. and if I may say ignorant, to rec- 
ognize the impact of a force of 5.000 
citizens marching through the streets 
of Fort Wayne. Perhaps you should 
write an article on the history of 
marches and tbcir success in gaining 
civil rights in this country. One cannot 
ignore the people when they come out 
in force. 

The next contention I will take up is 
how you so eloquently put it, that 
Wendell Brane "punched" an escort in 
the face. Actually, he was putting his 
arm up In defense when she spat on 
him. I do not believe the judge ever 
said he "punched"' anyone, and further- 
more I do not believe you were an eye- 
witness, therefore such remarks are 
slanderous. 

Also, your theories about the sexual 
revolution, Christianity, and right- 
wing goals arc quite impressive, but 
your attempts to back up your idiotic 
conjectures wilh a few vague dates 
hardly made an impression on this 
reader. There is really no need to 
compare the worth of causes, but since 
you brought it up, how can you com- 
pare the deaths of over 23.000,000 
innocent human beings to a compara- 
ble handful of homeless people. 



Furthermore, if you think that hav- 
ing abortion legal curbs child abuse 
you arc sadly mistaken because child 
abuse statistics have tripled in this 
country since abortion has become 
legal. The mentality of violence that 
abortion has brought upon the children 
of this country is certainly account- 
able. Violence used to bring us instant 
solutions to our problems is wrong, 
whether you're black, white, male or 
female. There must be a better way.

Even ihough I have fond memories 
of a youijiful Elvis from the classic 
films "Blue Hawaii" and "Girls, 



Girl.s. Girls," I still would rather see 
sideburns on my envelopes. 

Why you may ask. Well, I have 
several reasons for my beliefs. First, 
sideburns are hip today. Jason

I'm also for the stamp featuring 
Elvis of tbe jumpsuit days because 
he told me during a telephone inter- 
view Monday Uiat he still looks like 
that. Elvis, it seems, has remained 
untouched by tlie fashion movements 
of Uie last two decades. 

"I still where them same white suits 
baby." Elvis told me. He called from 
a phone booth at a Dubuque, Iowa, 
truck slop. Elvis said he has been 
making a living lately performing as 
an Elvis impersonator. "I'm pretty 
good," he said.

Artistic films 

Local theater offers movie alternatives 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

In a lime when wiilcss comedies 
and brain-dead aclion movies make the 
big money. Fori Wayne's Northwood 
Cinema offers a rcfrpshing option. 

Since Dec. 20, Norihwood Cinema 
has exclusively featured aitislic and 
inicUigcnt Films, Mosl of ihe movies 
thai play at Norihwood Cinema arc 
critically acclaimed but make little 
money. 

Some of tlic films screened so far 
this winicr incluJei! Peier Grccn- 
away's uikc on "The I'L'mpesl" — 




DL'bbi&lt;: Koepke 



"Prosperos Books;" the Coen broiiier's 
"Darion Fink;" Gus Van Sam's "My 
Own Privaie Idaho;" and David Cro- 
nenburg's "Naked Lunch" which is 
now showing along with "At Play in 
the Fields of the Lords," 

Debbie Koepke, Norihwood Cine- 
ma's manager, said there were several 
reasons for the switch to artistic films. 
"I've always had an interest with this 
kind of film, and when the new Gener- 
al Cinema al Coldwaler Crossing came 
here, we had a chance to change our 
formal," she said.

PLEASE. 



American Red Cross 



Koepke said Northwood Cinema is 
part of Ihc General Cinema chain. She 
noted that some General Cinema the- 
aters in other cities have also switched 
to playing artistic films. 

Along with current movies. Koepke 
plans 10 screen some classics. "Citizen 
Kane" played two weeks ago. and 
Koepke said she hopes to bring back 
more movies of that caliber. 

"We are going to show classic films 
from time to ijme if we have the space 
and die interest. 1 hope to stan a classic 
series, maybe running several musicals 
and a series of Alfred Hitchcock 
films," said Koepke. 

She noted that, like "Citizen Kane", 
classic films are being restored and te- 
released. "Surely when ihe restored 
prints are made available, we'll play 
(hose films too," she said. 

"I'd like to devote more lime to 
classic films," Koepke said. "But I 
haven't researched it enough to know 
how il would go over," 

Koepke said much of her re-iiearch 
comes from feedback offered by the- 
ater goers. "Our audience lends lo be 
more vocal th.-in Uiose at commercial 
theaicrs. They have requests on what 
they'd like to see and what they'd like 
10 see come back." she said. "That can 
help a lot. We arc very open to sugges- 
lions, Il helps us know what people 
want lo see." 

Bui some people arc surprised by 
what they see, Koepke said. 

"We've had some surprises and 
some complaiius, especially when ilie 
film has an ad campaign with a critic 
calling it 'die best movie of the year.' 
A lot of people came to see 'My Own 
Privaie Idaho' thinking ii was 'Bill and 
Ted ir or something because it had 
River Pheonix and Kcanu Reeves in il. 
People like that are often shocked and 
surprised by what ihey see," she said. 

Koepke said she enjoys discussing 
film with people who go lo her theater. 
"The people who come to movies here 
usually love film and like to talk about 



movies. I find thai really enjoyable." 
she said. 

Along with input from theater 
goers, Koepke said she uses several 
criteria lo help her pick Ihe flicks to 
SCTeen al Northwood Cinema. She said 
she reads film irade-ioagazines and 
reviews, and attends special screen- 
ings. Koepke said her favorite pari of 
the job is picking die movies. 

Some of the filnis coming soon lo 



Northwood Cinema include; Beeban 
Kidron's "Antonia and Jane." Claude 
Chabrol's "Madame Bovary," Pedro 
Almodavor's "High Heels," and 
Sieven Soderbergh's "KAFKA" which 
siars Jeremy Irons. 

Koepke noted thai Northwood Cine- 
ma is now offering a discounted ticket 
price lo IPFW students. All regular 
shows are now just S3 for students.

The win moved the Volleydons lo 2- 

in the MIVA and dropped the Buck- 
eyes lo 1-1. The win also marked ihe 
eighili consecutive victory for iPFW at 
home over Ohio Stale, Buckeye 
Coach, Pete H.inson, aitrtbuted Raul 
Papaleo's effeclive middle hilling as a 
decisive factor in the loss. Papaleo 
finished with nine kills. However, 
inconsistent play by Ohio State was 
also a factor. 

Tlic IPFW defense stepped up lo slop 
Ohio Slate as Quenlin Spiegel and 
Felipe Ralat were able to gel six and 
nine blocks, respeciively. 

Spiegel was also able to score nine 
kills coming off the bench in a subsli-
