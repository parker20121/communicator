Soccer team uses ineligible 
players; athletic board 
votes to forfeit all games 



By KATHY CONRAD 

; In a meeting held Tuesday, 
October 16, the Joint Athletic Com- 
mittee revealed that six of the fifteen 
members now playing on the Indiana- 
Purdue University soccer team are 
ineligible players. Consequently, 
previous wins and tied games are 
being forfeited by the team 

It was voted by the committee to 
contact the three teams with which 
the IU-PU team won or tied games. 
The schools will be notified that these 
games will be forfeited as a result of 
the ineligibility of the ~ ! ~" 
members. 






Another decision was made to 
contact the three remaining teams 
scheduled to play the team this 
season. The situation will be 
explained and the schools will be 
offered the option to play or not with 
the IU-PU team. Regardless of the 
decision made by the schools, all 
games will be automatic forfeits. 



According to James Bolinger, 
director of student activities, the 
common practice to determine eligi- 
bility of players serving on inter- 
collegiate sports at IU-PU involves 



thre basic steps. First, the names of 
players on the team must be sent by 
the coach of each sport to Bolinger. 
Concerning the soccer team, Andy 
Johns is IU-PU's part-time soccer 
coach. He also teaches at Saint 
Charles elementary school in Fort 
Wayne and is an assistant football 
coach at Swenger High School. 



Then forms are sent to Dr. Dave 
Skelton, director of records and 
admissions, where he fills out needed 
information on each student. In the 
final step the information is simply 
sent back to Bolinger for the determi- 
nation of eligibility of the players. 

Eligibility rules for IU-PU inter- 
collegiate athletic participatio 



For freshman students, the predi- 
ctability table, a Big Ten Conference 
Eligibility Table combining high 
school and SAT scores, is used to find 
the academic standing of the student. 
During the second semester the 
fresliman student should have al- 
ready taken 12 credit hours and have 
a semester grade point (index) of 1.60 
or more (Indiana University scale!. 

As a sophomore, the player must 
have a cumulative grade point index 
of 2,00 with a semester grade point 



By KATHY CONRAD 

Should the Fort Wayne Indiana- 
Purdue University campus become a 
unified and independent state-sup- 
ported college? In recent months a 
great deal of controversy has arisen 
over a report concerned with the 
governance of multi-campus univer- 
sities in Indiana. 

Prepared by Boyd R. Keenan, the 
report has become known as the 
Keenan Report and has caused i 



throughout the s 

In a recent interview with Dr. 
David Onwood, president of the 
Purdue chapter of the American 
Association of University Professors, 
(AAUP) the possibility of becoming 
an independent college was discus- 
sed. According to Onwood there are a 
large number of advantages to IU-PU 
breaking away from the mother 



index of 1.60 or better. 

Junior and senior eligibility 
requirements involve a 2.00 cumula- 

: grade point index and a 1.70 
r grade point index. 



All students ir 
full-time program of studies. This 
includes completing at least 12 credit 
hours per term for each term enrolled 



According to Bolinger, the major 
problem with the ineligibility of the 
six team members centered on the 
completion of enough credit hours. 

Further discussion at the meeting 
concerned the possibility of soccer 
being omitted as an inter-collegiate 
sportat IU-PU. Soccer would become 
an organizational, intramural sport. 
This would mean the loss of any 
funding for the team through the 
student fees. 

The possibility that the six 
ineligible players might receive 
varsity awards was also discussed.

Onwood was asked how he felt

which must make the faculty more 
efficient, happier with the fact that 
they are able to do their job better.

crazy. I can discuss some of my

roast is another project planned in 
order to get students and organizat- 
ions to use the Student Union 
facilities. 

He also commented, "Student 
response was so good to our first pig 
roast held during the Harbor Arbor 
days last spring that we felt we should 
sponsor it every semester. This is 
another opportunity free to students 
who have activity cards." 

He also noted that a spring pig 
roast and concert is in the planning 
forr 



"There are some people who feel 
they like the name, yes, but I'm not 
sure how wide-spread" this attitude is. 
Most of us have a professional 
standing which depends on what we 
do. 

"it's our faculty, I think as much 
as anything else, who realize that to 
do their job better, they want 
unification. I do believe that the 
faculty are feeling that the job is here 
to be done and they're here to do it. 

Dr. Onwood expressed some 
thoughts concerning the problems he 
encounters when trying to get 
changes in the way things are done. 
"I go to my section chairman who 
goes to his academic dean who goes to 
the dean and director on this campus. 
That's only three layers, that's not too 
bad, But the dean and director on this 
campus then report to a man in 
Lafayette who finally might report to 
the president at Lafayette, who then 
inturnwiU make iccomnwiida lions to 
the board of trustees or not. That man 
is in a very unfortunate position, 
because he is president of Purdue 
University, and he has to make 
decisions about the Fort Wayne 
campus, even though his prime 
concern is the Lafayette campus." 

The changeover to a unified, 
independent university would not

are no academic programs that need 
to be changed, no duplicated sections 
except English, I believe, and 
perhaps education. 

"I don't see that there's a great 
danger that the programs would be 
weakened; I think, if anything, we 
could get to strengthen our offer- 
ings." 

Dr. Onwood was asked his opinion 
of whether the community would 
accept the campus if it were to 
become independent of the mother 
universities. "Well, I think the 
community as a whole has been 
astounded that we've kept this 
ramshackle arrangement going so 
long. The question I hear out there 
from people who understand the 
set-up is, 'When are you going to do 
something about that place?' " 

According to Dr. Onwood, there

be tied in to an old campus - it's better 
for the students, it's better for the 
faculty. But you can't do this 
forever." 

When asked if the time is now, he 
replied, "I think it's the best of all 
possible times, because if we don't do 
it now we're going to get in another 
band aid situation, and this place has 
been band aided for long enough." 



2 ineligible, they could not receive 
the awards. However, the possibility 
of some sort of recognition is being 
considered. 



"Also, too, I think we could do a 
better job of serving our students if 
we were one campus." According to 
Onwood, study programs need to be 
under one system. He feels it is 
difficult for students to get into areas 
which only one school, IU or PU, 
offers. "To generate a student who 
had an engineering background and a 
language background on this campus 
isn't very easy right now. Engin- 
eering, what there is of it, is offered 
by Purdue, languages are offered by 
IU and it's very rare for that sort of 
across the Berlin Wall type combina- 
tion to be offered. . . .Surely it should be 
something that the university should 
be forseeing as desirable. 

"It would help to have one set of 
procedures for dealing with students 
and with grades. Right now the 
students in one course are being 
subjected to two different grading 
systems." Purdue students can 
receive a grade E, which means the 
student has failed, but that they can 
take a test which, if the student does 
well enough on, they can receive a 
final grade of D. In the Iu half of 
IU-PU, the student would simply fail. 
"I believe most of us really agree that 
this campus must be unified." 



Some comment has been made 
concerning whether or not the 
professional standing of the educators 
at IU-PU would be affected by the 
unification of both halves of the 
University. Dr. Onwood expressed 
his personal feelings on the subject. 
"I believe that if I need to wave a flag 
that says Purdue on it to show people 
that I'm a good guy, then I'm not a 
very good guy. If I need that name 
behind me to do my job well, then I'm 
not very good, am I? I believe that 
my professional standing depends on 
what I do, not on the label I'm sold

ST. JOHN'S JOURNAL 



Student control of athletics 



The Student Senate recently passed a resolution demanding equal 
representation on the Joint Athletic Advisory Committee. While equal 
representation will be a step in the right direction, it does not go far 
enough in righting the injustice of the present committee make-up. 

At present there are six faculty members and four students on the 
committee, each appointed through their respective senates. Also on the 
committee in an ex-officio position is the campus athletic director. 

Taking the committee at face falue. students seem to be well 
represented, especially when one considers the norm for such 
committees across the nation. Most universities give students little or no 
voice in athletic affairs. 

But this is not most universities, as athletics are financed almost 100 
percenl by student fees and not by ticket sales and alumni grants. When 
examined in this light, having four student members on the committee is 
nothing more than tokenism. 

Since the monies that fund athletics are received through a student 
tax, the athletic budget must be examined by and meet the approval of 
the students' elected representatives in the Student Senate. 

To meet this condition, we recommend that the following procedure 
be adopted; (1) the committee be composed of equal faculty and student 
representation; (2) the committee act much in the same manner as it 
does now, formulating policy and budget proposals; and (3) the 
committee submit to the Student Senate the annual athletic budget for its 
approval. 

We realize that requiring Senate approval of athletic budgets is a 
significant change in the present policy. But we feel strongly that this 
change is necessary and justifiable. Those who must pay the bills should 
be entitled to determine which bills will be paid. 

We urge the Student Senate to reconsider its resolution for equal 
representation, and to strengthen it with our suggestions. It is imperative 
that the power over the purse strings be placed where it rightfully 
belongs. 

Change in habits vital 



"Waste not, want not" was an adage that served earlier generations 
of Americans well. Food and firewood were the direct product of toil. 
Security was gained only by being prudent today with an eye on 
tomorrow. When the frontier faded and industry and mechanization 
began to transform American life, basic foodstuffs became plentiful and 
cheap enough to allow a certain profligacy in deciding what goes into the 
pot and what is thrown away. As for fuel and power, we began turning up 
thermostats, driving cars and switching on appliances with little mind for 
the cost, especially in terms of natural resources. 

We ascribe all this to what we call "progress" and, while we can still 
look forward to more of it in creating a good life for ourselves and our 
neighbors, we have clearly reached a turning point in the way we 
consume food and energy. Our farmers now are going to be feeding 
people in many countries besides our own. We are going to pay dearly for 
the oil we must import. Concern for the environment is limiting the 
electric power at our disposal. Circumstances are demanding that we 
come to grips with the fact that our living standard is not only the highest 
in the world but undeniably the most wasteful. 

An agronomist at the University of Washington estimates the 
American people will throw enough food out with their garbage next year 
to prevednt a significant proportion of the deaths by famine that are 
likely to occur because of drought and crop failure in Africa and Asia. 

The irony is that the worldwide capacity for food production is great 
enough that no one on this planet needs to starve. However, the 
mechanism for producing, marketing and distributing foodstuffs is not 
based on hunger but on buying power. People in industrialized countries 
are affluent enough to pay whatever it takes to sustain their eating habits 
- including their habits of waste. We have not bid up grain prices so high 
that poorer countries which must import food, and relief agencies which 
can help them, are being squeezed out of the market. 

Meanwhile our country is facing both diplomatic and economic 
problems because of the amount of petroleum we must import. We are 
now burning up 12 million barrels of oil a day in one form or another and 
the figure rises steadily. Developing new sources of fuel and energy is 
only part of the solution. The fact is that our petroleum "needs" are 
higher than they should be because of our lackadaisical attitude toward 
energy conservation in our daily lives. 



Foreign policy in moral quagmire

"I cannot see the United States 
expanding commercial markets with 
the Soviet Union," observed Rep. 
Wilbur Mills, D-Ark., "if the price is 
to paid in the martyrdom of men of

lectuals like novelist Solzhenitsyn and 
physicist Sakrahov, both of whom 
have warned that expanded trade and 
technological help from the Unitd 
States will only strengthen the Soviet 
dictatorship. 

However, while Mills' initial 
opposition is welcome, the Soviets are 
likely to give the surface appearance 
of relenting in their campaign of 
repression to gain from the United

More 'corners' in heroin war 





By JOHN PINKERMAN 

President Nixon said recently, 
"We have turned the corner on drug 
addiction in the United States." 

The President doubtless has more 
information available to him than any 
other person in the country, so his 
words would seem to be good news in 
the extreme. Also, his credentials 
have been applauded by Dr. Robert 
W. Baird, a New York expert on 
heroin, who told a Senate Judiciary 
subcommittee hearing, "I think we 
have to thank President Nixon. I 
think he was the best drug expert of 
all by pulling out of Vietnam." 

Other evidence, however, is not so 
encouraging - it is in fact downright 
frightening. 

At the same time Mr. Nixon was 
telling us that we had "turned the 
corner" and were spending 10 times 
as much on antidrug campaigns as

this park once was, and for a number

Chilean Marxists 
ruined themselves 



By WILLIAM GIANDONI 



licide, the 
Marxist cause suffered a serious 
reverse, at least in the Western 
Hemisphere. 

What Moscow, Havana and the 
Marxist world term "the correlation 
of forces" was destroyed when the 
democratic people of Chile rose up 
against their oppressors. 

No longer could the Reds point to 
Chile as the wave of the future, as 
proof that socialism could be imposed 
on a freedom-loving nation without 
the military intervention of the Soviet 

In Chile, the worst fears of the 
Moscow-line Communists, those who 
prefess to believe in the "peaceful 
road to socialism," were confirmed. 

The fast-paced events Tuesday, 
Sept. 11, showed not all Marxists are 
disciplined enough to play the 
democratic, or pseudo-democratic, 
game that would be required of them. 

It was not Salvador Allende's 
mistake. It was impatience of many 
of the men around him, in his govern- 
ment, in the political parties that 
made up the Marxist "Popular 
Unity" coalition. 

Allende was a lifelong Marxist, 
one of the founders of Chile's Socialist 
Party, an organization that 1

Communists as well as Socialists, 
and the other Marxist organizations 
in Chile, all proclaim "socialism" as 
their immediate goal. 

But there are serious differences 
within the individual parties and 
between the parties as to the means to 
attain that end.

in Chile. But the firebrands, notably 
Sen. Carlos Altamirano, youthful- 
looking secretary-general of the 
Socialist Party, and the leaders ■ of 
terroristic Movement of the Revolu- 
tionary 'Left (MIR), who include 
Allende's own nephew, sought to force 
the Popular Unit government .to 
eradicate capitalism, to eliminate the 
bourgeoisie, once and for all, and to 
get on with the revolution, right now. 

Chilean Communists, who were 
preaching a form of peaceful coexist- 
tence long before the late Soviet 
Premier Nikita Khrushchev made the 
phrase popular, counseled Allende to 
take a cautious approach to the 
building of socialism. 



But, just as Allende allowed the 
opposition - the Christian Democrats 
and the conservative National Party 
- to voice their dissent, in Congress 
where the opposition was the major- 
ity, in their newspapers and over the 
radio, so he allowed the Marxist 
extremists to speak out. And, 
inevitably, he was pushed, or allowed 
himself to be pushed, into even more 
radical positions. 

What seems to have really 
aroused the Chilean military was the 

evidence that not only were the ultra- 
leftist groups, like MIR, trying to stir 



That is to say, at one and the 
same time, President Allende, a

trying to subvert the armed forces.

VOLVO: 

IDEALLY SITUATED 

BETWEEN THE ABSURD 

AND THE RIDICULOUS. 

By not going to 
extremes, Volvo 
accomplishes more 
than cars that do. 

Up front, a Volvo has 
as much legroom as a 
Cadillac DeVille. In back, 
as much as a Buick Electra^ 

Which gives Volvo the 
space and comfort of big cars li 
the one on the right. Instead of 
squeezing you into the ridiculously 1 
small space of little cars like the 
one on the left. 

Yet a Volvo's turning radius is 
actually smaller than a VW Beetle. 

Which means Volvo can maneuver ' 
in and out of parking spaces and traffic 
like little cars. 

To call maneuverability a big-car 
specialty would be absurd. 

And while a Volvo may not leave.j 
big cars behind in the dust, its fuel- 
injected 2 liter engine lets you move 
right out in the fast lane. Something t 
can't be said as quickly about little qfl 

So instead of compromising by 
going to extremes, go halfway and j 
everything. Get a Volvo. 

To get anything else would be 
either absurd or ridiculous.

Doctor's Bag 

By ARNOLD WERNER, M.D. 

QUESTION: I am studying to be a dancer and also enjoy 
jogging. It is undesirable for dancers to develop bulky 
muscles. My dance teacher said that heavy jogging would 
develop big athletic muscles, is this true? (Written by a 



ANSWER: There are many factors that go into muscle size 
and shape other than just exercise. The shape of muscles 
appears to be largely dependent upon the presence or absence 
of androgens (male hormones). Hormones with androgenic 
activity are found in both men and women as are hormones 
with estrogenic (feminizing) qualities. In the presence of 
large amounts of androgen, muscles tend to assume more 
mass and appear more bulky. The tendency can be 
accentuated by certain types of exercises such as weight 
lifting. However, women who engage in the same type of 
activities as men will not develop as bulky appearing muscles 
because of a lack of sufficient amount of androgens in their 
systems. 

Another important fact in the shape of muscles appears to 
be genetic. Body size and shape is often hereditary and two 
people from different families on the same diet engaged in the 
same activities are apt to have vastly different appearing 
muscular configurations. An interesting sidelight to this is 
that there are also differences between individuals in terms of 
muscle metabolism, so that some people are capable of energy 
expenditure over a very long period of time, whereas others 
are better equipped to utilize large amounts of energy over a 
short period of time. This is most apparent if one studies the 
difference between sprinters and long distance runners, where 
they often have markedly different body configurations and 
also have different patterns of energy consumption during 
activity. Jogging and swimming tend not to develop bulky 
muscles, but rather to develop thinner muscles with longer 

QUESTION : I heard that if a man were to wear boxer shorts 
instead of tight fitting underwear, he would remain sexually 
potent longer. The idea was that one's testes would be freer, 
get more exercise, and hence have better circulation. 

ANSWER: The theory behind wearing loose fitting underwear 
that you allude to, is not related to freedom or exercise. Testes 
are designed to be indolent. They hang loose in the scrotal sac 
so that they are maintained at a slightly lower temperature 
than the rest of the body, this being more conducive to the 
production of live sperm. However, it would only be in the 
most unusual of circumstances that tight fitting underwear 
would hold the testes close enough to the body to heat them up 
sufficiently to inactivate them. In any case, producing active 
sperm is not the same thing as impotence, which is a failure to 
be able to perform sexually. Excessive worry can produce 
impotence, however. 



marriage and children. If he were to die before we were ready 
for this, I would like to be able to get pregnant by artificial 
insemination with his sperm that had been frozen. I am 
wondering how long sperm can be frozen and still be capable 
of fertilizing an ovum. 

ANSWER: Unfortunately, your very touching idea does not 
have much of a chance of working. Although there has been a 
great deal of publicity to the contrary, the facts are that sperm 
frozen under the best of circumstances do not have a high 
liidihood of fertilizing an "egg for more than a few months. 
Beyond 6-9 months the possibility of fertilization occuring 
successfully diminishes greatly. 

A few simple measures can decrease significantly the 
chance of your boyfriend dying before you could get married. 
A very large number of deaths in young people occur due to 
accidents, many of which involve automobiles and 
motorcycles. Survival can be increased dramatically by not 
driving a motorcycle at all, and by fastening your seat and 
shoulder belt when driving a car. In addition, never driving 
while intoxicated also enhances survival greatly.

CHARLIE HUSTLE-THE HOT DOG WHO MADE IT 

Charlie Hustle adopted his father's philosophy on life: give it all 
you've got, and when vou have to, give it more than you've got. And 
Charlie, one of the top professional baseball players today, has done just 
that for 11 years. 



In the spring of 1963, the players of the Cincinnati Heels look a poll on 
the green, rookie second baseman, Charlie Hustle. Theciiirslinn- will this 
upstart win a spot on the Reds' squad? Everyone said no except regular 
second sacker Don Blasingame. 

Hustle did not have a great arm. bl.i/ing speed un-u-eptinnal power 
All he did was plav his guts out, day in and day out. Surely after a slum 
while his unextinguishable enthusiasm would wane. That's what they 
thought. . , . . . 

But Charlie Hustle made that una team and is new en Ins way to 
Cooperstown He has won the National League batting title three 
times-in 1968, 1969, and last year, 1973. He has now hit over .300 for ten 

Inevitably though, once in a while he has overhustled and looked 
bad \nd at 'those times to many fans, he was just a funny little kid in a 
man's game. He gained the reputation in many circles el being a hot dog. 

mil lle-ile ke| In vine apposing pitchers wild with his base hits and 

heads up play. He kept the hoi dog trademark through the years, but 
everyone knew thai he was also in elite company: he was a superstar. 

Justrecenllv Charlie Hustle and bis Ciiieinnali n s laeeil the New 

York Mets in the 1973 Notional League championship playel Is. In the first 
game Hustle, who hil only five home runs in the regular season, cracked a 
game-tying circuit clout off Tom Terrific. 

Then he won the fourth game with a dramatic twelfth-inning blast at 
Shea Stadium to tie the playoffs at two games apiece. 

Hustle also batted nearly .400 in the playoffs. But his antics in game 
three will forever overshadow his roundtrippers and oilier balling feals 

In the fifth inning with the Reds out of the game 9-2, Hustle slid into 
second trying to break up a double play. Aller Hie play Mots' shortstop 
Bud Harrelson hurled a few greetings at Hustle who in turn started 
pummeling and touched off a brawl. 

Most defmilelv Harrelson should have kept his trap buttoned. But as 
well, Charlie Hustle should not have started a brawl in a stadium filled 
with rabid Met fans. 

When he returned to his left field post after the inning, Hustle was 
bombarded with assorted objects. He was forced to leav e the field and 
could oot return until Yogi and three Met players begged the fans to stop 
the onslaught. 

The contest ended without further incident as did the playoffs. 

But fabulous Charlie Hustle and Met fans are still al war. After game 
four he stated. "I was trying to break up a double play. Thai doesn't mean 
I'm dirty. Look, I'm a "professional ballplayer, not a chorus girl. What 
was I supposed to do, stand there and look at him?" 

And after the playoffs: "They got the fans in the zoo and took them 
out to the ballpark." 

These comments may well have had considerable substance. But 
some things are better left alone. Has Charlie forgotten that he must go 
to Shea Stadium nexl year to play in the regular season? 

Many of the signs which greeted Mr. Huslleui I he final playoff game 
were obscene. Many of those sign writers will be back nexl year just to 
see Charlie Hustle. They might figure that the hot dog needs some 
dressing: home-made dressing. 

Take care, Charlie Hustle,

locations on the Fort Wayne campus. 
The games and dates scheduled are 
as follows: October 20, Indiana vs

Purdue. 

The locations that will be used

President Brock Able and those in 
the Students' Government who work-

AL pitchers hit 20 

In 1973 twelve pitchers from the 
American League reached the charm- 
ed 20-game win circle. 

The defending world champions 
from Oakland produced three: Ken 
Holtzman, Vida Blue, and Catfish 
Hunter. California ended the 1973 
campaign with two: Nolan Ryan and 
Bill Singer. 

On the other hand, the National 
League came up with just one pitcher 
who collected a score of triumphs. He 
was Ron Bryant of the San Francisco 

So you conclude that baseball's 
top throwers in 1973 came from the 
junior circuit, right? 

Wrong. The American League's

managers to stick with their starting 
pitchers longer: the designated hitter

Smith, Stoneface 
collect triumphs 



By VINCE LOCHBIHLER 

Both Smith and Stoneface seem to 
be looking toward their November 4 
clash to decide which team will finish 
the regular season undefeated. Smith 
and Stoneface raised their records to 
4-0 last Sunday as Smith beat the 
Frosh 32-6 and Stoneface edged Circle 



In an opening game, the Geology 
Club failed to appear against the '73 
Calls and dropped their third straight 
game. The Geology Club is the only 
team which has failed to score this 
season. The '73 Calts tallied their first 
victory in three outings. 

The other 1:30 contest saw the 
inspired Circle K club play almost 
even to Stoneface in an 8-0 loss. Mike 
Stratton scored from 15 yards out for 
the winning touchdown. The loss 
evened Circle K's record at 2-2 but 
they remained in fourth place. 

The 2:30 game saw Smith have 
their hands full in their 32-6 win over 
the Frosh. The all-freshman squad 



played well against undefeated Smith 
and was down only 13-6 at the half. 
Shib Neddeff scored twice for Smith 
while Mike Usina and Bill Sommers 
each tallied once. Mark Pantello 
added the final touchdown. 

Don Klein scored the first 
touchdown or the year for the Frosh 
on a one-yard plunge. It was the first 
score off the Smith defense this year. 

Next Sunday, the Frosh will play 
the Super Jocks in a 2 :30 contest while 
the opening games feature Circle K 
against the Geology Club and 
Stoneface versus the '73 Calts.

The Indiana-Purdue soccer team 
fell to the Lakeland Lakers 7-3 last . 
Saturday at the Mastodons' field. It . 



Tony Host started the Laker 
scoring in the opening minutes with a 
shot from the penalty line. Juro Peric 
scored minutes later to put Lakeland 
ahead 2-0. Andy Lochstampfor 
assisted on the play. 

Peric again scored at the 21:56 
mark of the opening period with a shot 
into the right corner of the net. But 
Greg Roberts brought the Mastodons 
to within two on a direct kick which 
floated over the Laker goalie into the

from the game— including three from 
IU-PU. Terry Younghans and the 
Laker goalie exchanged words and 
were promptly ejected b y the 
referee. 

Ed Schmieman and Greg Roberts 
were also given the "thumb" in the 
second stanza. Schmieman was 
tossed out for interfering with the 
goalie, and Roberts for returning a 
punch from a Lakeland halfback. 



Sadler took a pass from Phil Roberts 
to make it 5-2. Roberts scored five 
minutes later on a pass from 
Schmieman.

QUESTION: The A. L. record for most total bases in a rookie reason is 
374 held by Tony Oliva while the N. L. record is 352 held by which current

Piccolo lives 



The book, A Short Season, depicts 
the life and ultimate death of Brian 
Piccolo. What Piccolo said in May, 
1970, just one month before his death, 
shows the personality and dedication 
of a great man. It has been an 
inspiration to everyone to keep 
fighting even though the "chips may 
be down." 

Pro football is not easy-it's a 
damn tough profession. I think 
anyone who says it's easy is kidding 
himself. Sure we're doing something 
we love. But there's so damn much'' 
practice. Hockey, baseball, and 
basketball players-when they hit 
their season, they're playing games. 
We live from week to week-getting 
ready, always ready. It's hard work 
involving great physical and mental 
strain.. .but to me,- it's a glorious way 
to make a buck." 

"you know, it's the fans who really 
make it worthwhile. You should see 
the mail I've been getting. I love the 
notes from kids, things like, 'I'm 
sorry to hear you have a sore chest. 
Hope it'll get better soon'-things like 
that. Or the letters from people who 
have had surgery similar to mine. 
Those I really appreciate-especially 
the ones who've been around a while 
after their operations." 

"I feel I can do a heck of a lot of 
good, once this thing is licked, but I 
know it's going to take time. It's not 
an easy fight, and it's not a short 
fight. It'll take time-but hell, I've got 
lots of time." 

Piccolo died at the age of 26, yet 
he lived his life to the fullest. Pro 
football indeed lost one of its finest
