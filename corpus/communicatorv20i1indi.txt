...Accelerated 

Enter college going in the right direction with one of the new computers from Zenith 



V\m Smt 



sophisticated rollers are built with the college student in 
mind for today and the future professional tomorrow. 

One look at the syllabus and you'll see why this new 
class is 80 popular. The semester starts off in high gear 
with an introduction to the new road scholars: the Zenith 
Super Sports &amp; LIMITED EDITION Super Sport. 

These rugged on-road, off-road portables really show 
their stuff even under the worst driving conditions. And 
without being gas guzzlers. With "intelligent power 
management", power is rationed to subsystems for 
maximum battery operation. Giving you great mileage. 

Whether you choose the LIMITED EDITION model 
with an internal 1200 baud modem or the Super Sport 
with RAM option of 1.64MB with EMS, even the most 
advanced course is clocked in record time. ^ 

Setting the curve in its class is the new Zenith Z-286 
desktop PC. This high speed racer runs at 8MHz with 
zero wait states, is AT compatible and can move up to MS 
OS/2 technology in the future. And talk % 
Z-286 comes complete with 1MB RAM with e 
room capabilities - to 6MB ■ without using a 
slot. Plus i^single 3.5" 1.44MB media sensing floppy drive 
lets you "read and write" 72bK disks. 

It's an accelerated course. The new class of computers 
from Zenith put you on the fast track in college and get 
you going in the right direction.
