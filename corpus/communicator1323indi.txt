opinion 



Let's put Reagan 
back on his horse 



Life lu.il hasn't been easy for poor 
Ronald Reagan this past year. Faeed 
with ninunlains nf numbers even his own 
expert! don'l understand, an economy 
lhal stubbornly refuses to do what he 
gay* il will, and a war in El Salvador 
thai isn't anything like the ones that 
John Wiiyno won so often, it's just no 
wonder lhal our he I en gu red President 
has forgollen about us . 

Forgotten diut behind his reams of 
statistics hide reams or people— human 
beings, nol all of whom can make it to his 
■100-a-pIalC fundraisers or help put new 
Clllno on bis table. The people whom 
Reagan flew over on his recent trips 
through the midwest are the forgollen 
ones, not Ihe people he met in the state 
legislatures 

II the Presidenl is too busy to get in 
touch with us then il is our responsibility 
lodosnwilh him tor his hired helpi. And 
(he 1FFW Student Senate Is doing just 
lhal. 

The Senate's Legislative Affairs 
Committee, chaired by Barry 
Ilaumgnrlner and Diane Kandis, has 
begun u teller writing campaign to 
proles I Ihe proposed cuts in financial aid 
lo college students Campaigns such as 
Ibi-s one have proven effective in the past 



on projects such as the building of the 
Athletic Center 

Thus far. this is the only action being 
proposed by any group on campus The 
Communicator hopes lhal both the 
faculty and the administration will not 
only support the students, but will 
Initiate programs of their own. It would 
be very depressing for a professor to 
give a really exciting lecture to a 
roomful of empty chairs. 

More can be done than just writing 
tellers. A public hearing by the State 
Student Assistance Commission (SSACi 
will take place at IPFW on Thursday. 
March 4. at 10 a.m., in the Walb 
Memorial Union. 

Also 4th District Congressman Dan 
Coats will host a "Town Meeting" at 1 :30 
pm on Saturday, March 6, at the Noble 
County Public Library' in Albion. 

Attending cither or both of these 
meetings will go a long way toward 
making our wishes known to those 
chosen lo represent us. 

If students, faculty and administration 
all get together lo help OUR President, 
he Milt not have to face these problems 
nlonc— then he can get out of that stuffy 
office and back to his wood-chopping and 
horseback riding, where he really wants
