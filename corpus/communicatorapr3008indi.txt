Q 
•o 



Miether students 
are planning lo spend the 
summer traveling or sim- 
ply driving to and from 
work, they will have to 
deal with the increasing 
price of gas. According 
to http://www.gasprice- 
watch.com, the national 
average is $3.57 a gallon. 
Why is gas so expensive? 
Are greedy oil company 
executives to blame? 
The biggest cause of the 
problem may come as a 
surprise. 

This campaign sea- 
son, the candidates have 
been quick to criticize 
oil companies for mak- 
ing "record profits." An 
article on Sen. Barack 
Obama's campaign Web 
siteTtates that he "fought 
to eliminate the tax give- 
aways to oil companies... 
oil companies that have 
spent half a billion dol- 
lars lobb&gt;ing Congress 
in the last ten years while 
their profits have risen to 
record highs,"

Fort Wayne stands against violence: Iwo peace [allies, marches, and a vigil in one day 



ByDANEILJEHL

Last weekend, over 
400 attended a rally and 
march against violence 
in the community. The 
events were held because 



is violence, and change 
begins by taking a stand 
against it." 

Then came the 
march. Following the 
police motorcade were 
the community group 
"Peace in the Streets, 
Inc. ", the Urban League's 



week, and the thirteenth 
of the year just over a 
week ago. The city of Fort 
Wayne held a vigil and 
had testimonials at night 
vrith 13 lit candles for 
each of the homicides in 
the city. 

"Peace in the Streets 
Rally" was the first event 
of the day. The march 



began al South Anthony be change in the com-

Marche Solomon 
brought her eight-year 
old lahari Burrett for 
that very reason. Ms. 
Solomon said, "I want to 
show my son the main 
idea is to keep peace and 
we need to stop the vio- 
lence; and so we are both 
here to support the com- 
munity." 

For Larry and Betsy 
Carswell, it was all about 



family. Larry Carswell 
said, "This is personal 
for us. This has a per- 
sonal focus as it should 
for everyone." 

There are more 
planned events. The 
Urban League is having 
three straight nights of 
community meetings 
from June 3-5, with each 
from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.. 
at the Fort Wayne Urban 
League on Creighton and 
Hannah Streets. 

At IPFW in the after- 
noon, there was a vigil. 
On April 18, barely a 
week earlier, Liette "Lola" 
Martinez, an exchange 
student from Las Cruces, 
New Mexico, was stabbed 
to death in her apartment 
at Waterfield Campus 
student housing. Una 
Morris, the mother of 
one of Martinez's room- 
mates has been arrested 
and charged. About lOD 
held an afternoon vigil 
in her memory outside 
her apartment in student 
housing. 

Again at IPFW that 
night, it was Take Back 
the Night, the second 



annual march and rally to 
stop the violence against 
women and children. 
MayorTom Henry issued 
a proclamation. The 
event i.vas organized by 
a number of IPFW orga- 
nizations and local com- 
munity groups. Over 100 
marched while chanting, 
"TWo, four, six eight: no 
more date rape." 

The purpose was also 
to raise awareness and 
end violence, including 
physical abuse violence 
and violence against 
children. The group lit 
31 candles depicting the 
number of homicides 
since the first annual 



Take Back the Night a 
year ago. 

Channel 15 News, 
Fort Wayne, reported on 
the 11:00 evening news 
that police had been 
called to a shooting of an 
unidentified person in 
the face near North Reed 
Road. Later they learned 
it was a paintball gun. 
The fad this was not the 
founeenth homicide of 
the year may be a sign of 
hope. 

One thing is certain. 
The residents of Fort 
Wayne are ready to take 
a stand— to stop the vio- 
lence.

Unfortunately, adding to 



increased by over 3500 
billion since the start of 
2007. Partly due to this 
increase in the money 
supply, the purchasing 
power of the dollar has 
decreased. According 



to the Consumer Price 
Index, the doUar has 
lost 4.28 percent of 
its purchasing power 
since 2007. Many non- 
government sources 
show even greater loss. 

This lossofpurchaslng 
power means that 
increasing the money 
supply is effectively 
the same as increasing 
taxes: more money 
for the government 
and less money for 
individuals. Exxon 

Mobile, ConocoPhillips 
and Valero Energy have 
an average profit margin 
of 7.9 percent. Including 



inflation and gasoline 
taxes, the government 
increases the cost of a 
gallon of gas by 18.38 
percent, more than 
double oil company 

Even if the 

government forced oil 
companies to operate 
on zero profits, it would 
not help Americans as 
much as controlling 
inflation and ending 
gasoline taxes. However, 
regardless of who wins 
the election, it wrill likely 
be the oil companies that 
continue to be blamed 
for the high price of gas. 



Watch your mouth! "Gay" is not an insult 



By Chris Schlarb

Imagine being a 
student, waiting for the 
professor to start class, 
and some people sitting 
behind you are chatting. 
Then you hear "That Is 
so gay." The whole class 
hears the phrase that was 
spoken and no one says 
anything. Nowimagineif 
you were a Gay, Lesbian. 
Bisexual, Transgender or 
Ally tGLBTA) indiudual. 
sitting in tliat same class, 
hearing that phrase, time 




after time. How would 
you feel? 

Every time I hear

sick to my stomach. Its interrupted. I decided are saying and the effects 

asionishingthataplirase, to write this article to of that phrase on others, 

which is hate speech, is educate the general By writing this article, 1

feel safe to be who 
they are and not worry 
about being ridiculed 
because of it. We can 
only accomplish this 
by speaking out for one 
another. 

When someone says 
"That is so gay," what 
word is the word "gay" 
replacing? Normally, 
it's a word like "lame" 
or "stupid." When the 
word "gay" is used in that 
context, it has a negative 
or derogatory meaning. 
So avoid looking hateful 
by not saying 'gay" in a 
derogatory manner.

IPFW professor publishes poetry 
book, encourages students to write 

Curtis Cfisler, a visiting professor, iiiustfdtes rebiith of creativity tlirougf) determir)dtion 



By ANDREW STACKHOUSE nalism, as he didn't like 
(cyraln8liolmail.com hoW editors WOUld "CUt up 
his Stories. " 

After graduating &amp;om 
IPFW with BA in English 
a minor in theatre, Crisler 
pursued an MFA in po- 
etry at Southern Illinois 
University Carbondale. 
Through his 
graduate work, 
Crisler began 
to lake part in 
more poetrj' 
workshops. 

These work- 
shops were 
truly generative 
to him, tliough 
he warned new 
writers that it 
was a process one had to 
get used to. He was "beat 
up so long through the 
process" that work- shop- 
ping wasn't damaging to 
his writing ambitions. 

In fact, the process was 
great because it offered 
ivriters the chance to re- 
ceive constructive criti- 
cism from both peers and 



"There is an isolation 
in writing, but if you're 
v^^ling to accept it. there's 
also a community," slates 
Curtis Crisler, in a recent 
interview about his career 
as a writer. Crisler, a visit- 
ing professor of creative 
writing here at IPRV, re- 
cently published his first 
book of poems, Tbugh 
Boy Sonatas. 

Crisler spoke much 
about creative writing and 
its relation to its audience, 
both in inception and 
throughout the process. 
Indeed, he was inspired to 
further his writing career 
after taking several Eng- 
lish classes and achieving 
positive reviews from his 
peers and teachers. 

Crisler was also pro- 
pelled into writing after 
becoming dissatislied 
with his prior major, jour- 



i 



more experienced poets. 
When asked what 
was the best advice to 
give aspiring ivriters, 
Crisler said "The best 
thing to do... is to read 
and write," 

For him, it is impera- 
tive to read as much as 
possible and to 

learn as much 

about the writ- 
ers one reads 
as well. Read- 
ing will encour- 
age one to try 
out new writing 
techniques and 
emulate the 
various writers. 
However, it 
isn't enough to imitate; 
one has to make a tech- 
nique his own. Crisler 
compared this experience 
to a band doing a cover 
song. When approaching 
a song, one has to keep 
its strengths, but also in- 
corporate the strengths of 
the band into the song. 
In talking about ivri ting. 



Crisler also mentioned 
how one sometimes has 
to rely on the whims of 
serendipity. 

Finding a good editor 
and group of peers to re- 
view poems are only met 
by chance. One will never 
know where you will meet 
someone who will influ- 
ence you, so it's impor- 
tant to keep your eyes and 
ears open. 

In fact, a chance en- 
counter led Crisler to get- 
ting Tough Boy Soiialas 
published. While attend- 
ing a poetry workshop, 
one of the facilitators 
of the workshop asked 
Crisler for more of his 
work. 

He handed over his po- 
etry manuscript without 
giving much thought of 
much happening. 

Fortunately, the fa- 
cilitator then showed the 
manuscript to his now 
publisher who encour- 
aged him to publish the 
compillation. 



"Baby Mama" roars into theaters: 
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler's chem- 
istry makes storyline believable 



By RUDI GREENBERG 

U-WIRE 



Post-Will FerreU "Satur- , 
day Night Live" has had its 
highs and lows, but one 
thing shone above all the 
others: Weekend Update 
with Tina Fey and Amy 
Poehler. "Baby Mama' re- 
unites the duo in a chick 
flick as funny as it is sen- 
timental. 

Fey, in her first lead- 
ing film role ("Mean 
Girls" doesn't coimt; Fey 
may have ivritten it, but 
Lindsay Lohan stole the 
show), stars as Kate Hol- 
brook, the yoiuigest vice 
president at Whole Foods 
knockoff Round Earth, 
who has just been tapped 
to spearhead Round 
Earth's new flagship store 
in Philadelphia. She's a 
successftil, 37-year-oId 
single woman, but she's 
unfulfilled -- Kateivantsa 
baby But alas, Kate tries to 
conceive artificially nine 
times to no avail, and her 
doctor tells her she has a 
"one in a million chance 
of conception." 

So. Kate opts to hire 
a surrogate. The fee? 



Sino,000. The surrogate? 
The Dr. Pepper-drinking, 
ignorant-thinking, white- 
trash-looking Angie (Poe- 
hler, "Satinday Night 
Live"). Enter baby mama 
drama. 

Angie rolls up to Kate's 
swank Philadelphia 

apartment in a trashed 
Suzuki with her common- 
law husband Carl (Dax 
Shepard). "He never asked 
me to be his wife, but he 
never didn't ask me. So, 
it's going pretty well," An- 
gie ex|Dlains. But then, the 
marriage goes bad and 
Angie, now cartying Kate's 
baby, shows up at Kate's 
apartment and effectively 
moves in. 

Kate and Angie live to- 
gether as a modern-day 
odd couple -■ the strict, 
neat, healthy and ca- 
reer-driven Kale trying 
to tame the immature, 
messy junk food-eating 
and TV-watching Angie. 
Tliey leam to live to- 
gether and even become 
^ends -- a task thai isn't 
so hard, considering the 
pair's chemistry. Fey and 
Poehler could go down as 
one of the great comedic 
teams if they continue to 
make movies together - 



the dichotomy between 
die two works extremely 
well. Fey is tlie straight 
man to Poehler's wackj- 
ness. 

When Angie decides 
she's gouig to be Kate's 
surrogate, she reads Kate's 
energy {something she's 
apparently good at) and 
likes what she sees. "Kate, 
I want you to put your 
baby inside of me," she 
says. "Angie, I'm going to 
put my baby inside you." 
Kate replies. Then, the 
pair embraces as the sun 
sets. That scene, plus the 
following insemination 
scene, defines the chem- 
istry betiveen the two. 
It doesn't matter if both 
characters have elements 
that are a tad unrealisUc - 
- Fey and Poehler work so 
weL together they make 
the characters more be- 
lievable. 

One might assume 
that with Lome Michaels 
aboard as executive pro- 
ducer and a host of "SNL" 
cast members and alumni 
diroughout the film. Fey 
wrote "Baby Mama" like 
she did "Mean Girls," but 
surprisin^y. she didn't. 
The man behind "Baby 
Mama" is Michael Mc- 



Cullers ("Enough About 
Me"), a former "SNL" 
writer who was also one 
of the writers behind Mike 
Myers's "Austin Powers" 
trilogy. McCullers gets his 
first chance to direct here, 
and he does a formidable 
job. He makes some of the 
more ridiculous scenes 
(Angle's insemination] 
work, and manages to 
strike a good balance be- 
tween absurdity and real- 
ity. 

There's also an excellent 
s u pp o rtin gca s t, wi th Steve 
Martin (The Pink Panther) 
stealing the show as Barry, 
the CEO of Round Earth. 
Martin's character sports 
a graying 
ponytail 
and talks 
about es- 
sences and 
out-of-the- 
box ideas. 
He's the ex- 
treme cari- 

cature of the corporate 
hippie. So. what is Barry's 
reason for opening a flag- 
ship Round Earth store 
in Philadelphia? "I was 
swimming with the dol- 
phins in Costa Rica this

Granite 

Growls Into Fort \ 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

mckjIOielpfw.tdu 



Every morning at 
Granite City Food &amp; Brew- 
ery, located at 3809 Cold- 
water Rd., manager Malt 
Burrous is busy micro 
brewing a small, but pow- 
erful range of beers suited 
to every mood. Burrous 
lovingly creates these 
beers every day, whether 
he is to be in the restau- 
rant or not. 

It may be because 
Granite City's microbrew- 
ery has a patented brew 
process called "Beverage 
Leverage", or as the staff 
has lovingly dubbed it, 
"Fermentus Interruptus." 
The process is compli- 
cated, begirming in a wart 
house in Iowa, where wa- 
ter undergoes detailed 
treatment to get the per- 
fect flavor . . . long before 
hops are added. 



"Great beer making is a 
process, and it's very pre- 
cise for this restaurant," 
said Burrous. 

If the meticulousness 
of beer production is any 
indicator, it should be 
pointed out that the rest 
of the Granite City is jus! 
as meticulous. 

Beginning at the door, 
greeters are there to smile 
and open the door for pa- 
trons, and though there 
was a wait, it was pleasant 
in the heated foyer where 
conversation can spon- 
taneously erupt between 
groups of people. 

The wait time was al- 
most exactly what the 
hostess calculated, and 
my dining companion 
and I were ushered and 
greeted immediately by&lt;

and management were 
friendly and fun. And the 
appetizer (Monterey Crab 
Wontons) was worth the 
wait. 

Remember at the Chi- 
nese restaurants when 
you order Crab Rangoon 
and youget a wad of cream 
cheese with "crab" flecks? 
The Monterey Crab Won- 
tons are the antithesis. 
Mounds of blue sum- 
ming crab were folded in 
ivith a bit of cream cheese 
and spices, and fried to 
golden brown. They were 
fresh, hot and delicious, 
though I would have cho- 
sen a different sauce than 
honey mustard to com- 
plement the flavors. 

Though Granite City 
has a full range of dining 
options from salads to 
steaks and seafood, my 
dining companion and 
■I ordered burgers. We 
chose the Buffalo Burger 
(with only 4 grams of fatl, 




and the Bleu Peppercorn 
Burger, and both were 
cooked to the proper 
temperatures, and were 
big, juicy and delicious. 
We chose waffle fries as 
sides, and while they were 
flavorful and decent, but 
next time 1 will get a salad 
instead. 

The real highlight of 
the meal was definitely 



the "little" chocolate cake: 
the first bite sent shiv- 
ers of delight down to 
my toes, and the home- 
made whipped cream 
was heaverily. And the 
whiskey buner sauce was 
no slouch, either. But the 
proverbial cherry on top 
of this dessert was the 
Broad Axe Stout beer that 
finished off the cake won- 



derfully, and I wj.ii [ biiFt 
if the euphoric feeling was 
my dining companion, 
the burgers or the beers. 
Either way, the combina- 
tion was intoxicating. 

Speaking of an intoxi- 
cadng experience, -check 
out GC's growlers. Pur- 
chase a handsome brown 
glass 2-liter jug from GC

Philharmonic 

presents award to 
music educator 



By LOUISA DANIELSON 

DanMgDJQiptwedu 



The Fort Wayne Phil- 
harmonic Music Educa- 
tors Award was present- 
ed lo Edward Keene from 
Norlhside High School 
for his ihirty plus years in 
Ihe field of music educa- 
tion. As a reward, he re- 
ceived five hundred dol- 
lars, with a matching gift 
of five hundred dollars 
tha[ went to his school 
for use towards musical 
needs. 

The firsi piece of the 
night was Beethoven's Pi- 
ano Concerto no. 1. and 
was performed by ler- 
emy Denk. This Annan- 
dale-on-Hudson pianist 
was called in last minute 
when Orli Shaham, the 
originally anticipated so- 
loist, was unable to per- 
form due to illness. 

Denk did a masterful 
job with Ihe concerto. 
Originally written in 1795, 
this concerto was full 
of Mozart-like runs and 
trills, yet still held some 
of the resolute determi- 
nation of Beethoven. Tre- 
mendously expressive 
both in music and in his 
actions. Denk stomped 
pedals, threw his hands 
above his head, and rip- 
pled slithering chromatic 
scales in the first move- 
ment. The second move- 
ment was more graceful. 
with a slow opening. Its 
waltz-like tempo took a 
touch of grand ceremony, 
then soft string pizzica- 
tos. The third movement 
again was vigorous, full 
of a fanfare-like sound. 



With great facility, Denk 
played with his hands 
crossing over, creating 
ringing arpeggios and 
driving the movement to 
a rousing finish. 

The audience re- 
sponded with an instan- 
taneous standing ova- 
tion. Denk bowed, then 
announced his encore, 
an Ives sonata. "He was 
a great American com- 
poser, of course," noted 
Denk on Ives, "and also a 
great fan of Beethoven!" 
This piece was a spin on 
Beethoven's fifth sym- 
phony juxtaposed with 
a children's chorus. The 
piece was akin lo elevator 
music, with a Beethoven 
flavor spun out in De- 
bussy-like chords -pleas- 
ant, albeit different. 

Following the inter- 
mission, the Philhar- 
monic played the Sym- 
phony No. 2 in e minor, 
op. 27 by Rachmaninoff, 
Led by Conductor Edvard 
Tchivzhel, this piece had 
an open, vibrant sound, 
as though the orchestra 
was dispersed about the 
auditorium instead of 
sitting on the stage. The 
first movement was a 
meanderinglamenl, unth 
sweeping strings. 

During the second 
movement, a frantic 
brass call traveled 
the string section, to 
be echoed by the .xylo- 
phone. A sweeter melody 
started in the third move- 
ment, evoking thoughts 
of glimmering starshine 
as the tune wound itself 
around the inner melody. 
In Ihe final movei 
the wheeling sir 
bmss and cymbals r 
a festive cacophony. 



Helpful hints for conserving gas 



By STEPHANIE SAMPLES 



With gas prices con- 
stantly rising it Is be- 
coming more and more 
necessary for ever^'- 
one to find new ways to 
conserve gas. Although 
there are the conven- 
tional options like hybrid 
cars or vehicles that can 
run on other fluids such 
as hemp or cooking oil, 
both of these changes 
are very costly. In an ef- 
fort to help those who 
do not have these high- 
cost options, there have 
been Web sites created 
that give tips on how to 
conserve gas with the car 
you have now. 

Running all errands 
at the same time, no un- 
necessary trips, carpool- 
ing, and taking a bike or 
walking whenever pos- 
sible is common sense. 



The "how to conserve 
gas" Web sites offer tips 
that may not be of com- 
mon knowledge. On the 
website www.autotrader. 
com under Lifestyle Cen- 
tral there are several lips 
on how to conserve gas. 

One of the uncom- 
mon tips is called Proper 
Maintenance, which is 
just inejfpensive do-ii- 
youiself maintenance. 



there is a tip that many 
people might overlook, 

/Another tip is to buy a 
locking gas cap. Reports 
from several automotive 
parts stores report when- 
ever a spike in gas prices 
occurs they see a run on 
locking gas caps. Many 
of the people purchasing 
them tell the clerks the 
same story: "I went out in 
the morning and my tank 



As gas prices soar, more 
resources become available for 
tips on how to save fuel. 



This includes replacing 
your air-filter and prop- 
erly inflating your tires, 
and usingonlythe neces- 
sary octane, all of which 
can make a big impact 
on one's fiiel economy. In 
addition, using the prop- 
er weight of oil and per- 
forming scheduled tune- 
ups can make noticeable 
improvements in gas 
conservation as well.

had been drained." Buy- 
ing a new gas cap may 
not be necessary, but is 
a smart investment for 
those who live in apari- 
ment complexes, or park 
outside for an extended 
amount of time. 

Another helpful Web 
site is www. farmers alma- 
nac. com. Located under 
the home and garden tab 
there is a list of very help- 
ful tips such as empt\'ing 



your trunk or truck bed. 
According to this web- 
site, 'every 200 pounds 
of unnecessary weight 
reduces mileage by one 
mile per gallon." The site 
also points out that the 
best time to buy gaso- 
line is during the coolest 
times of the day — early 
morning or late evening. 
During those times gaso- 
line is densest. 

Another tip is to use 
cruise control whenever 
possible, if you have it. 
By using cruise control, 
one can potentially gain 
5 to 10 percent per gallon 
ofgas on long trips. 

The previously men- 
tioned lips are all effec- 
tive ways to conser\'e 
gas and as a result save 
money. With no sign of 
gas prices decreasing it is 
important to utilize these 
Web sites and the tips on 
them, as well as doing ex- 
tensive research on fuel 
efficiency when buying a

^ THE PHRASE 

From Page 4 



Hale speech, other- 
wise know as antilocu- 
lion, can lead to worse 
ihings. According to 
Dr. Wallher, a faculty 
member of the IPFW 
Sociology Deparlmcnt, 
antilocution allows for 



verbal remarks lo be 
made about a group, 
people, or community. 
This leads to discrimina- 
lion that is acceptable by 
the general population 
or society. Once deroga- 
tory verbal remarks be- 



come acceptable, it is a 

very short step to defin- 
ing a person, group, or 
community in negative 
terms or as the other. 
However, when deroga- 
tory verbal remarks be- 
come acceptable to a 



society, the society may 
define the person, group, 
or community may lead 
to other damaging forms 
of behavior such as hate 
crimes and genocides. 

Research about hate 
crimes and genocide find 
that the person or group 
committing the hate 
crime or genocide must 



first hold negative views 
of the person, group, or 
community. Now, one 
may ask what can the 
campus do to eradi- 
cate or eliminate hate 
speech. 

First, interrupt the 
person saying the derog- 
atory term or phmse and 
educate them on what 



they just said and how it 
hurts people. Second, in- 
vite the person to attend 
a Safe Zone for Students 
workshop to learn more 
about homophobia and 
oppression. Ifyouwould 
like to learn more, email 
szstprog@iphv.edu. In- 
terrupt hate speech ev-

For the first time since 2005. the 
men's volleyball Final Four is set and 
without IPFW in the fight. 

Conference rivals Ohio State will 
represent the MIVA after a 3-0 sweep 
of Loyola last Thursday and another 
sweep of Bail State on Saturday. Loyola 
was the team that knocked IPFW out of 
the postseason, 3-2. 

This is the first time since 2003 
that the MIVA's top seed won the 
conference tournament. That Leivis 
Flyer team ended up forfeiting that title 
due to NCAA recruiting violations. 

The Buckeyes were named the 
four-seed on Sunday and will face top- 
seeded Penn State in the semi-finals. 



The Nittany Lions are ranked 
#1 in the country and defeated the 
Mastodons themselves just two weeks 
ago on Senior Night. Penn State won 
their lOth straight EIVA Tournament. 
This will be Penn Slate's 23rd trip to the 
Final Four although they have not won 
the National Title since 1994. 

The 2-3 matchup will be between 
Pepperdine and Long Beach State. The 
Waves of Pepperdine. who lost in last 
year's semi to IPFW, won the MPSF title 
on Saturday night, defeating BYU. 

Long Beach Stale, the n\ seed in the 
MPSF tournament, lost to Pepperdine 
in the semi-finals but will earn the al- 
large bid into the Final Four.

Is this the best time for a volleyball change? 



In All Directions 

By DAN VANCE 
vance-tad.blogspot.com 



In the past five years, IPFW has experienced many 
changes including an influx of young coaches. Since 
the fall of 2002, when the program became fuliy 
Division I certified, only four coaches have left the 
school. 

That low number leaves me expectant that will 
change in coming years. The biggest and most 
important change that could come in that area is the 
retirement of Arnie Ball, whenever thai may occur. 

When it comes to coaches at IPI^, mens volleyball 
coaches nationwide and preity much coaching in 
general, Amie Ball is in a certain class of his own. 

When you have been at a school for almost 30 
years and are one of the winningest coaches in your 
spon, there is never a "right time" to walk away. But 
the fact is that eventually, Arnie will choose to do 
so. And when he does, I pray that it is the right way 
because Amie Ball is the epitome of IPFW athletics 
and should always be remembered that way. 



There has always been talk of who would replace 
Amie when he retires from the sport he has helped 
define. Wdl it be son Lloy when he retires from 
professional and Olympic play? How about assistant 
Ryan Perrotte, who seems like he has been groomed 
well for the replacement? 

But most importantly, when is the best time? As I 
said before, there is no right time. So when would it 
be best to hand over the reigns? 

And as much as I respect and like Coach Ball (and 
as much as he"ll adimently disagree with my next 
assessment). I believe that this is the best time to 
leave IPFW in the capable hands of either replacmeni. 
Though, 1 am all for Ryan Perrotte. 

Coach and I have had some disagreements over 
theyears, sol expect him to yell at me for this, I really 
do. But it is nothing personal. Hell, if I had what I 
considered a family in IPFW athletics after covering 
them for six years, Amie would easily be the dad. 

But think about this: 

Coach Ball is fresh off of back-lo-back Final Four 
appearances, the school's first National Runner-Up 
finish, a 2007 AVCA Coach of the Year honor and 
saying goodbye to seven seniors {the most for IPFW

in quite sometime). 

As it stands now. there will be just two seniors in 
2009. The team is quite young with only two starters 
returning.' And those who are still around have quite 
the relationship with Perrotte. The next couple of 
years will be a rebuilding time for the mens volleyball 
program. I think it could be best to let someone else 
rebuild. No, Arnie would not be going out on top, and 
I know he wants to win a National tide pretty damn 
bad. But this may be the closest to going out on top 
that he may ever get. 

I'm not saying I want Amie to leave. On the 
contrary, I would love for him to stay forever. And 
coach, if I still have you reading my articles all these 
years later, let me say that I have truly enjoyed every 
second of covering you, talking to and interviewing 
you. I really do hope that you continue to coach at 
IPFW forever. Because as long as you coach, 1 will 
definandy be in the stands watching you do it. 

Since I won't be here when he does hang up the 
clipboard. I do truly hope that IPFW gives Amie 
the caring and emotional pariing that he deserves. 
Because when it does happen. Mastodon athletics 
will never be the same again. 



IPFW falls flat VS. 
Notre Dame at 
Memorial Stadium 



The Notre Dame Fighting Irish capitalized on 
four IPFW errors to shutout the Mastodons, 5-0 on 
Wednesday night at Memorial Stadium. 

The Irish only outhit IPFW, 10-7, but three of those 
hits came in a first inning rally that plated three. 

Notre Dame got RBI's from center fielder A.J, 
Pollack, leremy Barnes, and Billy Boockford. Those 
three runs chased IPF^ senior starter Ben Boehne 
after on two-thirds of an inning. 

The Mastodons turned to sophomore reliever Matt 
Ransbottom to stop the bleeding, and Ransbottom 
answered the call. 

In the third, Ransbottom got the teadoff hiner to 
fly out to left. He also induced two fly balls by the 
next two batters and should have been out of the 
inning, 1-2-3. However, the Mastodons dropped 
both routine fly balls to extend the inning. 

Boockford made them pay with a two-run double 
to left center, making it 5-0. 

Those would be the final runs of the game as 
Ransbottom and fellow relievers Sam Walker and 
Man Antos kept Notre Dame ofr' the board the rest 
of the way 

On the flip side, Irish starter Ryan Sharpley worked 
out of a pair of jams early. He left with the 5-0 lead 
after six innings. He gave way to Steven Mazur in the 
seventh and Tony Lanford in the eighth. 

Sharpley gave up three hits over six complete, 
striking out six Mastodons and walking three for his 
third win of the season (3-1). Mazuie gave up a hit in 
his only inning of work, and Langford gave up three 
hits in the combined shutout. 

IPFW shortstop Mark Garden, center fielder Jared 
Davis, and right fielder Garrett Segraves each had a 
pair of hits for the Mastodons. 

Boehne took the loss (1-2). 

Boockford vras 4-5 with three RBI for Notre Dame 
(27-10-1). 

IPFW versus Centenary 

The Mastodons played four games widi visiting 
Summit League opponent Centenary over the 
weekend, splitting the series. 

IPFW routed the Gents on Friday before losing 
both games of a double header on Saturday. IPFW 
took a 3-2 win in Sunda/s finale, keeping them in 
striking range of a postseason birth. 

IPFW opened the scoring in the 3rd inning as left 
fielder Quentin Brown scored on a two-out RBI single 
fi-om catcher Devin Taylor.

Mastodons shot down in Summit opener 



The IPFW women's tennis team fell 4-2 lo 
the Southern Utdi University Thundcrbirds 
on Friday evening in a marathon-match. 
The team dropped their Summit League 
tournament opener in a match that lasted 
over three hours, and finished at 1 1:15 PM. 

Things looked promising for the 
Mastodons, as they took the doubles point 
after 8-4 wins at No. 1 and No. 2 pairs. The 
duo of Ashley Coulson and Stacy Lish won at 
No. 1 with Amy flecht and Sachi Janek taking 
No. 2. The doubles win looked promising for 
IPFW, as the squad was 19-1 in matches in

IPFW Student-athletes recognized nationally for Academic Progress Rate numbers 



T\vo IPFW athletic teams have been 
honored by the NCAA in its annual 
Division I Academic Progress Rate 
(APR) Public Recognition Awards, 
released by the governing body In 
Indianapolis, Indiana. 

IPFW's women's volleyball and 
men's cross country teams each ranked 
in the top 10 percent within their 
respective sports nationwide among 
NCAA Division-I programs for their 



academic progress rate as determined 
by the NCAA. 

The APR provides a real-time look 
at a team's academic success each 
semester by tracking the academic 
progress of each student-athlete. The 
APR includes eligibility, retention 
and graduation in the calculation and 
provides a clear picture of the academic 
culture in each sport. 

"IPFW Athletics is very proud of 



the overall academic success that our 
student-athletes and teams continue 
to achieve on a yearly basis," IPFW 
Director of Athletics Tommy Bell said. 

'This honor for our Women's 
Volleyball and Men's Cross Country 
teams could not be possible without a 
concerted effort between our student- 
athletes, athletic academic counseling 
team, coaches, and the outstanding 
faculty oflPFW. " 



IPFW Athletic Department Faculty 
Academic Representative Dr. Elliot 
Blumenthal echoed Bell's comments. 

"IPFW's Student Athletes have 
worked extremely hard over the past 
four years to maintain an overall grade 
point average of greater than 3.0. In 
our first year of play in the Summit 
League they have also demonstrated 
their outstanding ability to compete 
successfully at the Division I level."
