FACULTY NOTES 



Indiana University Press has recently published a 
book by English and Linguistics Associate Professor, 
George Dillion. The book: Language Processing and 
Literary Criticism: Toward a Model of Reading has 
received favorable review by Choice, a journal for 
librarians. Indications are that the book will see wide 
distribution. 



Dr. Joseph Meyers, Associate Professor of Music, has 
recently had one of his students, Larry N. Reed, win 
first place in the division for advanced men in student 
auditions for the Great Lakes Region of the National 
Association of Teachers of Singing, Inc. The com- 
petition was held at Ball State University. Approx- 
imately 200 students and 40 vocal teachers from 
Indiana, Michigan and Ohio participated. 

Acting Chairperson and Associate Professor of 
Theatre, Dan Cashmon has participated in the ''Tree 
of People'' project held in Wroclaw, Poland. Cashman 
was one of approximately 25 people invited to par- 
ticipate in the 12 day, 12 night experimental theatre 
project. 

Dr. Warren W. Worthley, Chairperson of Manufactur- 
ing Technology Deportment, has been appointed 
member of the five member ad hoc committee to 
help draft the "objectives and organization" of a 
foundation to further develop the educational 
objectives of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers.
