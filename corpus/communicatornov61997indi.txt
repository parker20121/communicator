University faces harassment charge 

Wartell defended by staff 



Br Not Beckley 

Editor 

Started less than one year ago. 
the Campus Climate Committee was 
formed to look for ways to improve 
(he campus and to make IPFW the 
besl employer in Fori Wayne 

Irene Walters, director of univer- 
sity relations, said the committee is 
helping to foster a sense of family 
and pride at the university. 

She said the meetings have been 
successful and have led to many 
campus improvements. 

"I thought those meetings were 
amazingly constructive," Walters 
said Some of the improvements that 
have come out of the Campus 
Climate Committee are changing the 
campus map to show handicap 
access areas and inviting children to 
the IPFW picnic 

About 12 to 15 people show up 
at the committee meetings on 
Wednesday morning, Walters said. 
The meetings give the IPFW "fami- 
ly" a chance to criticize Chancellor 
Michael Waneil. 

"He's going way out of his way 
to encourage discussion," Walters 
said. 

Mary Helen Thuente. chair and 



professor of English and linguistics, 
said the Campus Climate Committee 
that Walters runs "is a joke." 

"It's a horrible climate ... I 
would call it a reign of terror,'' she 
added. "We're in a downward spi- 
ral." 

Thuente said many people on 
campus arc reluctant to speak out, 
especially deans of departments, 
because IDcy arc afraid their budgets 
will be changed. 

She said the chancellor has very 
little tolerance for academic free- 
dom, which is, Thuente said, at the 
"heart of the university." 

Thuente noted that the amount 
of grievances have increased recent- 
ly. She said most of these more 
recent grievances concern harass- 
ment and intimidation rather than 
grievances for not receiving promo- 
tion or tenure 

Thuente said she and her bus- 
band, David Thuente. associate pro- 
fessor of computer science, used to 
be close with the chancellor, but 
they had a failing out. After their 
falling out, Thuente said they were 
placed on the chancellor's enemies 
list. 

William Frederick, associate 
professor of computer science, said 
be was approached by the chancellor 



Getting help on campus 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 

It is common knowledge that 
being a student can be stressful. The 
cold winter days can also wreak 
havoc on a person's mental health. 
Gray skies and damp weather are not 
known to lift foul moods. So what is 
a person supposed to do? Getting 
over it is easier said than done. 

While there are many people 
who can do just that even the tough- 
est person needs someone to talk to 
about things that they cannot figure 
out on their own. 

That is where Personal 
Counseling Services for IPFW 
comes in to help. Donald Smith, 
MSW, ACSW, CCSW, has provided 
personal counseling for IPFW stu- 
dents for two years, and he enjoys It 

"I do assessments and evalua- 
tions and supportive counseling at 
no cost," said Smith. "I want stu- 
dents to understand that it is simple 
and straightforward; confidential 
and free " 

There is no subject that cannot 
be covered in these free counseling 
sessions. Smith addresses personal 
and relationship problems which are 
often characterized by depression, 
anxiety and a host of other mental 
health problems. 

"I see a lot of students because 
of the dark, gloomy days and stress 
of midterms." said Smith. 

The needs of each student are 
assessed and if further or different 
type of help is needed. Smith can 
make a referral to the necessary pro- 



fessional Referrals are made to 
psychiatrists, other social workers, 
and psychologists 

There is no reason to suffer 
through the melancholy days of win- 
ter with no one to help you address 
your problems. If you are not sure if 
you need help, answer the following 
questions. If you answer "yes" to 
any of them, you may want to give 
Smith a call. 

1. Are you unable to make everyday 
decisions without an excessive 
amount of advice from others? 

2. Do you choose people and situa- 
tions that lead to disappointmcni. 
failure, and mistreatment even when 
better options are clearly available? 

3. Do you have difficulty sleeping or 
do you sleep too much? 

4 Have you lost interest in activities 
you used to enjoy? 

5. Do you have difficulty concentrat- 
ing? 

6. Have you wondered if you use loo 
much alcohol or other drugs? 

7. Do you worry excessively about 
things for no good reason? 

8. Do you have low self esteem? 

9 Have your grades dropped recent- 
ly? 

10 Do you have a persistent sense of 
hopelessness and despair? 

If you would like with talk to 
Don Smith call 481-6592 or 481- 
6595. If you would like to make an 
appointment through the Student 
Services call 481-6601. 
Appointments are scheduled on 
. Wednesday through Friday 8 a.m to 

5 p.m., and on Monday. Tuesday and 
Saturday evenings. 



to write a grievance against David 
Thuente, associate professor of com- 
puter science and Mary Helen 
Thuente's husband. 

"(The chancellor) he wanted me 
to file a harassment charge that I 
witnessed David Thuente harass 
him," Frederick said- 
Other IPFW staff may have been 
harassed by the university. Vickie 
Benccke, in charge of faculty 
records and budget in the academic 
affairs office, has a harassment suit 
fded with the university claiming 
that a hostile work environment was 
created 

Fenwick English, vice-chancel- 
lor of academic affairs, said that be 
could not comment publicly on the 
Benecke's suit. 

English said the chancellor of 
Purdue-Calumet had reviewed the 
case and said that "if the allegations 
are true, they would constitute 
harassment" 



Bcneckc's attorney, John 
Theisen said no complaints have 
been filed in court. Every avenue at 
the university level will be taken 
Once they are exhausted, then legal 
u. in -i i ■ could be taken 

"We expect to have something 
on file in about 10 days," Theisen 
said. 

Around 2 p.m., July 23, 1997, 
the campus police were sent to 
Bcneckc's house to hand deliver a 
letter 10 Benecke 

The letter apparently requested 
Benecke to return items that were 
removed from her office, 

Lieutenant Larry Jenks, campus 
police, said they did deliver an offi- 
cial university letter to Beneckc's 
house. 

Jenks said to the best of his 
knowledge, the police have never 
done (his before. 

Thuente said she entered 
Benecke's office to retrieve 



Beneckc's personal calendar and 
campus phone book 

Benecke gave written permis- 
sion for Thuente to enter her office. 
Benecke was on medical leave and, 
as of press time, is still an employee 
of IPFW 

Shortly after Thuente was in 
Benecke's office, she received an e- 
iii.nl from English. 

The e-mail said the items 
removed were taken without autho- 
rization and Benecke had not cleared 
the matter with the university 

Thuente was "directed to return" 
the items removed 

Thuente responded to English 
and said Benecke's authorization 
was being sent over to his office. 

One hour after that, English sent 
another e-mail to Thuente. This let- 
ter said "Mrs Benecke's calendar is 
not her personal property. It is uni- 
versity property . . 1 am reiterating 
my directive to return the calendar 



University property has been 
removed without authorization. 

I am referring this matter to 
Purdue University Counsel " 

Walters noted that less than one 
percent of the nearly 900 members 
IPFW community have filed griev- 

She said that was a surprising 
figure given the litigious climate of 
society today. 

She said what has happened 
recently on campus reflects very lit- 
tle of what is actually happening at 
IPFW. 

Walters said she was disappoint- 
ed in what has happened recently at 
the university She said the chancel- 
lor has a very positive reputation 

outside the campus. 

"It makes me very sad ... He 
has such a vision for (his place," 
Walters said. 



Omnibus Lecture Series 



Native-American writer re-enacts poetry 



Bv Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 

The Omnibus Lecture Series 
seeks to broaden horizons by pre- 
senting a performer who incorpo- 
rates prayer and song as well as sto- 
rytelling in her repertoire. 

Joy If. hi. renowned Native 
American poet and musician, will 
perform Nov. 10 at 7:30 p.m. in the 
Walb Student Union Ballroom 

Harjo will be using the ele- 
ments of storytelling, prayer and 
song when she reenacts her poetry 
collection from "The Woman Who 
Fell from the Sky." 

Joy Harjo was bom in Tulsa, 
Okla., in 1951 and is a member of 
the Muskogee tribe. She began 
writing poetry when the national 
Indian political climate demanded 
singers and speakers 

She has been called "one of the 
most powerful Native American 
voices of her generation." She has 
also earned a Master of Fine Ans 
from me L'niversity of Iowa 

Harjo's latest book, "The 
Woman Who Fell from the Sky." 
was published by W.W. Norton. 

The company describes the 
book as one that "draws from the 
Native American tradition of prais- 
ing the land and (he spirit, the real- 
ities of American culture, and the 
concept of feminine individuality " 

She has published a total of 
five poetry books, including "She 
Had Some Horses" and her award- 
winning, "In Mad Love and War." 

Added to her list of talents is 
screen writing. Currently she is 
working on an original screenplay, 
"When We Used to be Humans." 
for the American Rim Foundation. 
Harjo's participation in film began 



when she served as narrator for 
"The Native Americans" on TBS 
and Navajo Code talkers for 
National Geographic. 

There are also more literary 
projects in the works for Joy Harjo 
including "The Goodluck Cat" and 
an anthology of Native women's 
writings, "Reinventing The 
Enemy's Language," are soon to 
be released. 

Harjo has received numerous 
awards for her works including the 
William Carlos Williams Award 
from the Poetry Society of 
America, the Delmore Schwartz 
Award from New York University 
and the 1990 American Indian 
Distinguished Achievement 
Award. Recently she was awarded 
the Lifetime Achievement Award 
from the Native Writers' Circle of 
Americas. 

Chad Thompson, Associate 
Professor of Linguistics, feels that 
the accolades given Harjo are war- 
ranted He uses her work in bis 
Native American Literature class 

Harjo is "usually the favorite 
poet in my classes," said 
Thompson. 

"Harjo has the ability to create 
something very human in her 
work at the same time (exuding) a 
great deal of wisdom, but doesn't 
make the audience feel talked 
down to. Harjo has done amazing 
things " 

Among (hose he considers lo 
be remarkable are the way that she 
has been able to earn such recog- 
nition for being a poet 

Usually to gain such populari- 
ty a writer has (o produce short sto- 
ries or novels. Thompson feels the 
poem '"Woman Who Fell From the 
Sky' is masterful " 



Thompson is also impressed by 
the non-conventional way Harjo 
arranged the collection "The 
Woman Who Fell From the Sky." 
After each poem, Harjo adds com- 
mentary which adds depth to each 
piece. 

Thompson says that Harjo pos- 



sesses "a real skill that is respected 
by other poets and talent (bat is 
well-received by the public, both 
native and non-native." 

The event is co-sponsored by 
WBNI and WANE-TV News 

Channel 15 




Joy Harjo will speak at 7:30 p.m., Nov 10, in Walb Union.

Campus goes public,

"How long will ii take until 
Michael Wanell is gone?" has been 
the continual refrain beard around 
many offices after last week's issue. 

Stephen Bcering. president of 
Purdue, has already received Ihe 
smoke signals Time will tell what 
action, if any, will be taken about 
this matter. 

Criticism is, of course, expected 
from the chancellor. Why has he 
given the faculty the choice to write 
evaluation forms anonymously if 
faculty feel too intimidated to attend 
regular Wednesday meetings for 
"the campus cli- 



ignoring due process in regards to 
grievances, search and screen com- 
mittees and the treatment of univer- 
sity employees." said Michael 
Downs, chair of political science. 

But according to Walters, the 
faculty are satisfied with their work- 
ing conditions on campus. 
"According to our records." Walters 
told the News- Sentinel, "I can con- 
fidently say at least 95 percent of 
our employees are happy with their 
job situation."

The stature of those faculty

from the chancellor's approach to 
solve campus grievance procedures. 
The credibility and professionalism 
of the professors who decided to

They have spoken with nearly

Bomb threats: Enough is enough 



To the Editor: 

It seems to me that (here are a few students 
roaming about our campus who were deprived as 
children. Deprived of being told the classic tale 
of the boy who cried wolf. Why don't you huddle 
around my rocking chair and I will brief you on 
the story. By my recollection, it goes: 

There once was a little boy who watched 
over his sheep in the pasture. One day he decid- 
ed it would be fun to scream, "wolf' to sec what 
would happen. He did so and witnessed an 
incredible result. Not only his mother, but the 
whole town he lived in, came to help save the 
sheep. But when they arrived there they found 



Poor choice 

To the Editor: 

Printing Bob Snyder's letter was 
irresponsible. I am sick and tired of 
the stereotype that all Irish people do 
is sit around in their drawing rooms 
and talk about making bombs. That 
represents only a few people. I am 
positive that the Muslim Student 
Association would absolutely love "I 
hear that the Middle East is lovely 
this time of year." I'm sure that they 
are sick and tired of being stereo- 
typed as crazy bombing terrorists as 
well. Abigail Frost's letter was much 
better. She was very precise and did- 
n't attack other ethnic groups. Her 
point was made in a more intelligent 
and professional way. 

Renee Gilbert 
IPFW Student 



that there wasn't a wolf in sight 

The boy, impressed with this turn out, decid- 
ed to cry. "wolf again. And again... As time went 
on people became desensitized to cries of the lit- 
tle boy and thus became less prone to respond. 

To make the story short, one day tbe little boy 
really did come upon a wolf while his sheep were 
grazing in the pasture. He cried and cried, but no 
one came to help and so the wolf gobbled up the 
flock of sheep within moments, leaving the boy 
helpless and alone in the pasture. 

The moral of this story is that unless you 
need help you shouldn't call for it For one day 
when you really need help, it is not going to be 
there for you. 



The translation for those of you who call in 
bomb threats is that one of these days there may 
be a real bomb threat. Considering our student 
body waits right outside of the infected building, 
we, as a whole, have also become desensitized. If 
a bomb were to explode, many would be hurt and 
perhaps even killed. 

I hope to God nothing like this wdl ever hap- 
pen, but if it did, like tbe little boy. you would 
have the guilt upon your shoulders. Can you bear 
the weight? 

Andy Hanefeld 
IPFW Student 



Another side of the bomb threats 



To the Editor: 

Although 1 agree with many 
students who have written into The 
Communicator about bow disrup- 
tive the bomb threats are. I must 
admit that 1 do not mind missing a 
class every now and then. 

It's a strange dilemma. 

On one hand I am angry that 1 
drive all the way out to IPFW and 
find my class cancelled. 

Often it is the only class I have 
that day. 

I feel like I've wasted half a 
day coming out here just to fmd 
some ignorant fool cannot make up 
a good excuse for not doing bis 
work and must resort to terrorist 



lacacs. 

What ever happened to 'The 
dog ate my homework?" 

On the other hand, I don't 
mind too much if I have to miss a 
class 1 bate. 

I'm a senior and I'm Ured of 
taking classes that I feel have noth- 
ing to do with my major I know I 
should have taken care of that long 
ago, but I didn't 

Missing class gives me the 
opportunity to study without the 
distractions of my home life 

I can use (he time to apply 
myself to my next class or to 
review something more thorough- 
ly- 



All things considered, this is 

getting ridiculous. 

Sooner or later someone will 
figure out who is doing this and 
they will get their butts put in jail 
on federal charges. 

I'm sure that looks good on a 
resume.

At this point I would say, "You

What about all of the folks from out

Leave a little bit earlier 

Let's wait until kids are eigh- 
teen to get their drivers license. And 
how about driver's education in the 
winter? Almost anyone can drive 
under normal conditions Winter 
driving is a whole new ball game. 

And in the roundabout here at 
school, stay in the right hand lane. 
The inside lane is for suckers. As 
you come around, signal. You can 
only turn right. It is really that sim- 
ple. Don't wait until you get 
involved in an accident that is your 
fault. You'll see. When you finally 



hit someone in the lots here at 
school because you were driving 
bad, then I suggest you move to 
Michigan. You'll feel right at home 
there. 

Starting this week. I have a new 
idea for my column. I'm going to 
call it. "LOSER OF THE WEEK." 
This is a person, or group I feel 
needs 10 be recognized for their 
lameness. This week's is a no-brain- 
er. The bomb threat guy SO far, at 
least 6 this year. Each one can cost 
about a thousand bucks of our 
money. Plus time spent driving to 
class, salaries, etc.. I have been told 
that it has always been a male caller. 
They (the campus police) do have 
leads so if it's you. please stop it. It 
is a felony. Prison can be a drag. If 
you know who he is, or who they 
are, contact the 1PFW Police. And 
remember, you will be a hero. There 
is a $1000 reward for information 
leading to the arrest of this loser. 



John Denver: Country boy inspiration

.^ ^^^ J. X. b e e n 
B^^_V several weeks 

jRy since John 

MM. Denver's sad. 

. ^^^fr^L untimely death. 
^^^ 1 feel that it 
■ still fresh 
^H enough in our 
^^^^^^^^^^ collective mem- 
ory to reflect on just how much one 
thoughtful, unselfish individual can 
influence and inspire so many oth- 
ers. 

His passing prompted me to 
consider what the world would have 
been like had he never been bom. 1 
shuddered. 

1 then began to contemplate all 
the things I would have said to him 
in person if given the chance, and 
wrote it down in a letter that I'll 
never be able to mail. Good-bye, 
John. I wish you peace and love. 

Dear John, 

You don't know me. Well, yes 
you do know me. In fact, how was 
it possible for you to know not only 
me, but hundreds of thousands of 
other souls in the world through 
your music? 

Now that you're gone and your 
soul has transcended this world 
maybe you can truly get a feel for 
just how many lives your music 
actually touched. 



Lbe opportunity to hear your songs. 

My siblings and I must have 
played our parents' copies of your 
records a thousand times. Truth to 
tell, "Grandma's Feather Bed," 
"Thank God I'm a Country Boy," 
and "Calypso" were the highlights 
of the soundtrack to our childhood. 

I thank you for that. 

I wish I could have met you in 
person to tell you how much your 
music meant to me. I wish I would 
have been wise enough to attend one 
of your concerts when I still had the 
chance. But no, I kept putting it off 
until some other year. 

I'd get around to it sooner or 
later, I kept telling myself. 

Those are all fool's wishes 
now. The shattered remains of your 
experimental airplane informed me 
of that in no uncertain terms. 



Still, I had the insight to pur- 
chase some of your music within the 
last year; although it's not just 
music to me. 

I like to think of it as "How to 
Live Life" set to a melody. 

And I'd be willing to bet that 
I'm not the only one who'd testify to 
that statement. 

Your music told us how life 
could be lived to its fullest It cele- 
brated the wonder and beauty of 
nature. 

Jt told us to forget about the 
concrete and steel cities/prison cells 
that we've constructed for ourselves 
and live a simpler, more country- 
oriented lifestyle. 

You were always right. Thank 
you for continuing to remind me of 
the importance of rural conscious- 
ness. 

I'm still trying lo heed your 



message, John 

While having enough money 
to lead a comfortable existence is 
important to me, I believe that down 
scaling one's lifestyle paves the 
road lo true happiness. 

Lose the excess baggage! Your 
simple, yet lyrically complex, 
melodically crafted odes to content- 
ment are a faithful reminder of that 
mantra. 

I must tell you, John, that my 
life would sorely lack an integral 



element of its foundation had you 
never published your music 
"Looking For Space." "Rocky 
Mountain High," "Windsong," 
"Spirit:" These are all songs that 
describe me and my attitude. 

They make me want to see the 
good in everything and to cherish 
the fleeting amount of time that 
we've been allotted in these earthly 
vessels. 

lohn, I hope that you're still as 
happy and optimistic as ever now 



that you've traveled beyond this 
fragile world. As you leave us on 
that jet plane in the sky, remem- 



You've been an inspiration lo 

not only me. but to many countless 
others during your lifetime. 

I thank you for that, lohn, and 
know that, wherever I go, you'll be 
there to guide me home on the coun- 
try roads of my soul.

Imti Nisiitt: Seed Uniss in the IS 1 * rem liiiuitn 



Br Gail Ruble Crawford 
Features Editor 

One of my guy friends and I 
have a long-standing agreement: we 
both feel (bat, as a whole, the seven- 
ties were a pretty worthless time. 
Aside from Watergate, not a hell of 
a lot of importance happened Bad 
polyester shins and freaky bell-bot- 
toms, while 1 realize that they arc in 
style again, don'i count Come 
on — do those things really 
look good on anyone who 
isn't heroin-addicted? 

My mom flipped one 
time when she saw me 
wear a piece of seven- 
ties-inspired clothing — 
she said, "God, 1 wore 
stuff like thai when I was 
your age I feel old." 
Now I do, too. 

Granted, rock and folk 
music were great during 
that time, but I'll just try 10 
erase that horrifying phenome- 
non known as disco from my 
mind before it sears a painful bole 
into my skull. However, as seven- 
ties-phobic as I usually am, I was 
ecstatic about seeing the new movie 
called "Boogie Nights." 

"Boogie Nights" follows six 
years in the life of a dun-willed boy 
named Eddie, played by Mark 
Wahlberg Yes, that's former barc- 
cbested and underwear-exposing 
Calvin Klein model and former 
"Good Vibrations" rapper "Marky 
Mark" Wahlberg. The movie starts 
out in 1977, with our bero as a sev- 
enteen year old bus boy al a nighl 
club in California. 

As expected, Eddie wants lo be 
a star. He tells his girlfriend after 
they've had sex and smoked a joinL 
(Hey. this WAS 1977— sex was- 
n't dangerous back then, you 
know,) "Everyone's got one 
special gift." Eddie's 
special gift involves his 
"Torpedo Area," as 
porn director Jacl 
Horner (a spectacular 
Burt Reynolds) calls it after meet- 
ing the boy at the nighl club Lei'; 
just suffice it to say that Eddie's spe- 
cial gift has lo do with the size of &lt;? 



certain part of his anatomy. 

After asking Jack. "Do you 
wanna see it?" Eddie finds himself 
invited to star in a pom film. Eddie 
returns home that evening and, in an 
exceptionally disturbing scene, 
cries while bis mother tells him how 
worthless and stupid be and his 
dreams arc 




another room and doesn't defend 
him So he leaves, and beads 
straight to Jack's home. 

Eddie soon stars in his first big 
pom movie, but first be has to come 
up with a screen name He immedi- 
ately invents one, saying that this 
name appeared to him ; 
lights so bright that they explod- 
ed — or something like that. 
His chosen moniker: 
"Dirk Diggler. 
Don't laugh. I 
told you that 




dense 

Anyway. 
Eddie, or should I say. 
Dirk, proceeds to charm 
everyone with his child- 
like sweetness. After his first 
big, um, "love" scene, the camera 
man was so impressed with Dirk's 
"gift" that be missed a pivotal scene 
(lake a wild guess which scene I'm 
referring to). Dirk looks innocently 
at Jack and says, "Do you want me 



to do it again?" like it's no big deal. 
Thus, a pom star is bom. 

The other characters along for 
the ride (no pun intended) in this 
movie are an interesting Iol First, 
there's Rollergirl (Heath. 
Graham), a high school 
drop out who never, 
ever takes off her 
skates — and I do 
mean never There's 
a very disturbing 
scene at the end of 
the movie where she 
runs into someone 
who went to high 
school with ber He 
recognizes her as 
they're about lo have 
sex in a umo. on camera. 
She freaks out, can't finish (he 
deed and beats the crap out of him 
with ber rollerskates. 

Then we have Amber Waves 
(Jullanne Moore) I truly felt sorry 
for this character She has a son that 
she isn't allowed lo see because her 
ex-husband doesn't want turn to be 
exposed (again, no pun intended) to 
bis mother's lifestyle She sees her 
son exactly two times in six years 
and missing him destroys her. She 
tums to drugs and plays mother to 
the younger porno stars, especially 
Dirk. 

Then there's Reed Rothchild. a 
guy who's even more 
dim-witied than 
Dirk When the 
two first meet, 
they try to one-up 
each other by compar- 
ing how much weight each 
can lift. As anyone who's ever 
seen Mark Wablberg's naked chest 
can attest, there's no way that Reed, 
a scrawny, not -so- beautiful man can 
compete. 

Lastly, there's Buck, an 
African -American actor who has a 
penchant for wearing cowboy cloth- 
ing. He has a dream — he wants to 
open a stereo superstore someday. 
When he gets married halfway 
through the film, be and his wife 
apply for a loan to fulfill bis long- 
lime dream. The bank refuses the 
loan, saying that it won't support the 
pom industry, 




As his shooting star begins to 
fade (God. these jokes are too easy), 
Dirk tries desperately to cling to his 
fleeting fame He tries to do what 
every other seventies and 
ighties idol ined — 
to sing — which 
he does very 
badly (a great 
inside joke) 
He can't sell 
his demo 
tape and 
begins to 
realize that, 
outside of the 
porn world, 
Dirk Diggler is 
a nobody. 
Soon he finds him- 
self doing whatever it takes 
to survive on the street — including 
becoming a son of "peep show-hus- 
tler" type for people who will pay to 
see him "work" his gift Sorry, but I 
probably can't print an exact 
description of what he really does; 
you'll just have to see the movie if 
you're curious Does Dirk disappear 
or will he rise to Ihe top again (pun 
enlirely intended this time)'.' You'll 
have to see it lo find out. 

All in all, "Boogie Nights" was a 
good movie. It pokes fun at the flesh 
industry with often hilarious results. 
However, it also has scenes that are 
genuinely disturbing. I 
cringed on several 
occasions a 
watched bo 1 
some of the 
characters 
were treated. 
Outside of 
their world 
of sex, they 
each did 
whatever it 
took to sur- 
vive — and the 



par- 
ticu- 
larly a 




resui 



were 




painful to watch 

The movie 
drags in the middle, 
but the beginning and 
end are entertaining. Kudos 
must be given to Mark Wahlberg 
and Burt Reynolds — both were 
excellent in (his movie and I'm not 



cither But 
I will give 
credit where 
credit is due. 

Adding to the 
gaudy scvendi 
glory, the soundtrack is 
fantastic. My best friend 
and I spent the whole movie 
silently groovin' to ihe tunes, 
also spent a great deal of time laugh- 
ing at how "realistic" the porno 
scenes were This movie captures 
the pom industry perfectly — crappy 
plotlines, cheesy music, big-breast- 
ed women — everything 

Oh, and for a movie about (he sex 

industry, there's not really thai much 

flesh exposed Until the end After 

almost three hours, you get to see 

what makes our hero Dirk 

special. I read 

somewhere that it's 

not real So relax. 



However, be 
fore- 
warned — 
this movie is 
two hours 
and 35 min- 
utes long. If 
you're tail like 
me, find a seat 
here you can 
stretch out your 
s, or you'll regret it 
about an hour into the 
movie. Oh, and don't sit in the sec- 
ond row like my companions and I 
did. I still have a headache and it's 
been three days since 1 saw this

Singer Abra Moore 
at Piere's on Nov. 13 



ainger/song- 
writer Abra 
Moore will be 
appearing at Piere's 
on Thurs., Nov. 13, 
along with Big Head 
Todd and the 
Monsters. In case 
you're not familiar 
with Moore's musk, 
perhaps you've 
heard it in some of 
your favorite movies 
and television 
shows. 



shows Two of the Ihrcc films were 
in (beaiers recently — Excess 
Baggage, which stars Alicia 
Silverstonc, Benicio del Toro and 
Christopher Walkcn, and The 
Matchmaker, starring Janeanne 
Garafolo. 

Fox Television's Melrose Place 
and the season premiere of Parry of 
Five also featured Moore's music 

Abra makes a cameo appearance 
in The Newton Boys, set to open in 
February 1998. The film stars 
Matthew McConaghey, Ethan 
Hawke, Skect 



At a time when almost every 
new rock artist feels the need to 
trumpet her personal angst, Abra 
Moore offers a true alternative 
We're talking alternative-pop that 
stands up next to Liz Phair, Joan 
Osborne, and Ani Di Franco Listen 
to the prophetic lyrics and hooky 
refrain of "Four Leaf Clover." the 
darker, melodic psychedelia of 
"Keeps My Body Warm," and the 
guitar crunch of "Don't Feel Like 
Cryin'." 

Strangest Places is Moore's 
major label debut for Arista Austin 
and a perfect blend of the various 
sounds that have shaped her life 
since early childhood. 

"It's a canvas that I threw all my 
life experiences and musical experi- 
ences onto and (his is what came 
out." she says of the new album. 

"This music thing kind of just 
cbose me," says Abra. "I come from 
a very artistic family, so I"vc always 
done this, My father is an artist from 
(he.Beat generation. 1 grew up hear- 
ing Billie Holiday. Chet Baker and 
the whole jazz era. I was into the 
Beades, the Rolling Stones, Bob 
Dylan. Judy Garland, Belle Midler, 
Tom Petty and also all the 70s stuff. 
It colored my palette" 

Abra never bad to make a con- 
scious decision to pursue a musical 
career U came naturally She com- 
posed ber fust song ai age six whde 
growing up in the scenic splendor of 
Hawaii. Sbe studied piano during 
her early teens in New York City, 
later moving top Europe where she 
played small clubs along tbe coast of 
England and begged for change on 
the romantic streets of Paris. 

"I did a lot of growing up over- 
seas," sbe says. While studying at 
the University of Hawaii, she started 
playing with some friends she'd met 
on campus and soon became one of 
(he founding members of Poi Dog 
Pondering (a band thai would even- 
tually release two albums on 
Columbia Records) 

Settling in the music mccca of 
Austin. Texas, Abra recorded ber 
critically acclaimed debut album. 
Sing, for Bohemia Beat records. 
Sing was a quieter, more mtimaie 
work (ban Strangest Places 

Critics were especially touched 
by tbe title track, which was 
addressed to Abra's mother who 
died when she was four. 

In recent months, Abra Moore

Duron Duron returns 



Bv Oooie Miller 
Chief Reporter 

Well, it has finally happened 
No. not that something else, but 
something awesome. A band has 
made a comeback without overus- 
ing what made them popular in the 
first place — thereby making the lis- 
tening public hate them. You know 
that I am not talking about Motley 
Crue or Aerosmilh. These groups 
manage to write songs that sound as 
if they should be done by artists at 
least ten years younger. 

The super- talented group I'm 
referring to is Duran Duran. Now. 
don't get mad — if you like Duran 
Duran, you should still like them 
with Medazzaland. 

A while ago. I heard this song, 
"Electric Barbarella." on the radio. 
Shortly thereafter, a friend and I 
compared notes because she had 
heard it too 

"Is that a new one?" she asked. 

"I don't know," I replied. 



"Those keyboards were very 80s." 

"1 love 80s keyboards!" she 
exclaimed. 

"Me too!" I cried. Then we dis- 
solved into gales of squeals and gig- 
gles. 

1 was such a fan of Duran 
Duran. It was almost as if we could- 
n't have had the 80s without them 

They had the definitive 80s 
sound and they had the clothes to 
match. I felt so hip when I got my 
own copy of "Seven and the Ragged 
Tiger" when 1 was in the fifth grade 

I literally cheered when I found 
oul that "Electric Barbarella" was 
on a new CD They still have it. I 
spotted a recent photo of them — 
Simon LeBon looks Ihe same. 
(Yea!) 

The new Duran Duran is down 
to three members: two original; 
LeBon and Nick Rhodes and a new 
guy. Warren Cuccurullo. 

After listening to 
"Medazzaland," I realized what 
makes Duran Duran durable: It's 
their uncanny ability to address tbe 



world in a postmodern way with 
pulsating, hypnotic rhythms 
They always seem to have this 
above-it-all persona, but they 
address real-world themes such as 
"Undergoing TreatmenL" Listening 
to this CD made me feel as though 1 
should be driving around European 
tunnels at night with ihis CD in my 
Lexus. 

Now. that is an extreme fantasy. 
This CD is for you if you like a Hi- 
de surrealism with your realism as 
far as music is concerned. 

Simon LcBon's haunting tenor 
voice with provocative lyrics are the 
selling poinLs of this album. And as 
far as fantasy goes, I think I'll put 
the cassetle in my Cavalier and sing 
along... "pretty, pretty, pretty 
Barbarella." 

One cntic wrote, "I've always 
found LcBon's voice a bit disturb- 
ing." 

That's a good thing: Maybe 
that's why Duran Duran included 
that in their liner notes. My recom- 
mendation? Gel this one.

The holiest thing alive

NCAA, GLVC 

to inspect athletics 



By Tony Laux 
Spouts Editor 




Butch 
Perchan 



With 
the recent con- 
finned viola- 
tions in the ath- 
letic program 
and concerns 
that Chancellor 
Wartell and 
members of the 
faculty bave 
raised with the 
resignation of 
NCAA 
Compliance 
Officer David 
Fairchild, it has 



announced that Commissioner Tom 
Brown of the Great Lakes 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
(.GLIAC). Commissioner Carl 
McAloose of (he Great Lakes 
Valley Conference (GLVC), and 
members of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association (NCAA), will 
be coming to this campus to evalu- 
ate the compliance program here at 
IPFW 

Butch Perchan said 
Commissioner Brown and 
McAloose "will look at the compli- 
ance records that we have and 
make recommendations for any 
changes that will need to be made." 

The NCAA will be here for 
four days and will examine compli- 
ance also and will be very thorough 
in its review of the athletic depart- 
ments observance of compliance 
regulations. 

"I expect on the whole thai the 
athletic department will get a posi- 
tive review," Perchan said 

"I'm not concerned about any 
particular sport," he added. 

'•Commissioner McAloose will 
come and make 
recommenda- 
tions on the exist- 
ing compliance 
program and will 
tell us (the athlet- 
ic department) 
what is being 




Perchan said. 

These visits came at the 
prompting of Chancellor Wartell 
who discussed this with professors 
Downs, Frederick and Hersberger 
who agreed thai these people need- 
ed to be invited to IPFW for inde- 
pendent reviews of our athletic pro- 
grams, focusing on, but not limited 
to the issues widely discussed on 
campus and in the community 

Commissioner Brown of the 
GLIAC will be here on Nov 5, 
Commissioner McAloose of the 
GLVC will be here on Nov 19 and 
20. and the NCAA will be coming 
after the recent violations of the 
program have been ruled upon 

After the reports are done the 
Subcommittee on Athletics will be 
asked to give these reports special 
attention and to make recommen- 
dations to the Faculty Senate based 
on the reports. 

In September The 
Communicator ran a story that 
IPFW self-reported several sec- 
ondary NCAA violations. 

David Fairchild, chair and pro- 
fessor of philosophy, resigned as 
NCAA compliance cooridnalor 
after reporting the violations to the 
NCAA and 
after bi s 
NCAA file 
turned up 
missing from 
his office.

Toretta best prospect ever, Wannstedt says 



Dirtu Laundru: Tonu laux 




* Congratulations to the Marlins for 
being the best team that money 
could buy I just laugh every time 
their owner Wayne Huizenga com- 
plains about the 33 million dollars 
that he lost, its 
not like any- A^ 
body twisted J 
his arm to 
go out and spend 
money on every free 
agent available. 

*Even though the 
Bears won a game 
ihey really lost in 
the long run. The 
Colts are never 
going to win two games 
the Bears won't get the num- 
ber one pick in this April's 
NFL draft I guess its okay 
because Ihey probably would 
have traded it away for anoth- 
er quarterback of the future 
like Gino Toretta or the great 
Tommy Maddox 

•The Iowa fans showed 
that they obviously don't 
have any intelligence. 
While beating the Purdue 
Boilermakers the chants of 
"Overrated" could be heard for a 
long time. Its not like Purdue had 
this great preseason hype like Iowa 
did before they did the typical Hay 
"dem guys are better than us" Frye 
dance 

•Let the bidding begin!! The free 
agents in baseball have already 
begun to file and the prices could hit 

an all lime high. The Sporting News 




said that we shouldn't expect such 
high salaries this year and I have to 
say that the train to fantasy land 
must have made a slop at their 
offices. Every year I hear that same 
crap and every year the salaries go 
higher and higher If owners want 
to keep paying the wondrous Steve 
Avery S3 8 million then let them go 
bankrupt. 

•The NBA started on Halloween 
night and the Boston fans got a real 
treat with the start of the Pilino era 
Not only did they win their home 
opener but them beat the Chicago 
Bulls. I love how the TNT announc- 
ers acted like that the season was 
over and that we should just hand 
the trophy to the Celtics. It was one 
damn game, wake up you fools, as 
much as I hale the Bulls they are the 
team to beat because of Michael. 
Go Pacers!!! 

•Top five reasons that lerry Rice 

/ill be back by the end of the 

season: 

5. JJ. Stokes can't cover 

all of Steve Young's 

lame ducks 

4 Wants to 
show off his 
scar to the 
Cheerleaders 
who have Iheir own form 
of "knee therapy." 
3. Tired of getting marital 
advice from O.J. Simpson 
and Ike Turner 
2. Can't find Ihe right 
"crutch" endorsement. 
1. Jerry can't keep up with 
Michael Irvin on the "coke" 
lines. 

•Top five reasons that figure skating 

isn't a real sport: 

5. Kristi Yamaguchi looks so "fit" 

doing those Wendy's commercials. 

4. Since the Russians aren't holding 

the participants' families hostage 

anymore the jumps and spins have 

gone down hill. 

3 It rums possible Armenian ke 

fishing holes 

2. The scoring is subjective not 

objective. 



1. Nike doesn't sponsor iL (Yet!!!). 
•Top five excuses by Dave 
Wannstedt why the Bears are losing: 
5, "Our punter kicks the ball loo 
far." 

4, "The other teams are lucky that I 
can't coach." 

3 "My calls to Doug Fluiie are 
going unanswered." 
2 "I needed money because I can't 
get any endorsements so 1 bought 
my offensive playbook from some 
guy named Buddy Ryan." 
1, "I can't get the respect of my 
players because I look too much like 
Sonny Bono. 



Top five reasons that the Colts 
won't win a game: 
5. Harbaugh is your quarterback, 
'miff said, 

4 Marshall Faulk sounds more like 
a Supreme Court Judge than run- 
ning back. 

3 Coach Infante says best lineman 
is Mandarich 

2 Colts fans are the same people 
who think that IU will go to the 
Rose Bowl. 

1 Players can't hear the audible: 
because of (he fighting fans who are 
trying to leave when the Colts are 
losing This usually happens during 
the National Anthem.
