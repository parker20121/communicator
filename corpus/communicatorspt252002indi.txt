In the 10 years Ihal Chancellor 
Michael Wartell has been at IPFW. he 
has seen a great deal of chance. "Folks 
coming lo IPFW who haven't been here 



ititled. 



"The 



last Wednesday, 

The leclui 
University Today," was prescnlcd as 

fiart of the anthropology department's 
uneh lecture series. VSrtell covered a 
broad variety of issues concerning 
IPFW including: housing, which he 
indicated is the number one priority 
right now; changine enrollment demo- 
graphics; sportSilPFVV's academic repu- 
tation; parking and strategies for the 
future of Ihe campus. 

Warlell began by discussing the 
changing student population, 
Enrollmeni increased 5.6 percent this 
year, from 11,129 students last fall to 
11,757 this lerm. This is nol Ihe greatest 
number of students Ihat have ever been 
enrolled al IPBV, however. 

Student enrollment was higher 
during Ihe 1990s. The number of credit 
hours taken this semester, which is how 



the administration measures growth, 
was al a record high. Students enrolled 
in 116,126 credit hours this fall, a 7S 
percent increase over lasl fall. 

The type of students attending 
IPFW has also changed. Students are 
younger now than they used to be as 
shovvn by the average sludenl age 
decreasing from 27 lo 25 years of age. 
More students are enrolled full-time 
now as well. Fi/ty-four percent are noiv 
al full-lime stalus, versus 40 percent 
previously. 

This changing sludent body has 
also meant changes for Ihe campus, and 
will mean ever greater change is in store 
in the future. IPFW now has more than 
SO student organizations, and Ihat num- 
ber is continually growing as new stu- 
dents create new groups. 

A health services lacility has also 
been added to the campus to accommo- 
date the medical needs of students, A 
nurse practitioner is now available all 
day for those in need. 

The stalled student housing initia- 
tive is a major locus, particularly now 
thai the sludent demogranhic has 
changed and more tradillonal students 
are attending the university. 

IPFW alhlelics have become more 



prominent as teams have gained 
Division I status this year. The 
new soccer facility has also 
helped lo draw visitors to the 
campus. 

Academics may also benefit I 
from Ihe increaHxt athletic locus, [ 
"Our academic repulabon vvill grow 
aspef^learedmwnbyathleticsand | 
other events." asserted Wartell, 

Many are not aware oi Ihe | 
academic successes that IPFW h; 
to its credit already. About 80 pe 
cent of IPFW's pre-mcd ina]o 
get into medical school, and l! 
numbers are similar lor pte-l.i 
sludenls. according to Wartell 

Those percentages m 
extraordinary for a school th 
size. Wartell attributes small cl:!' 
sizes and direct c 
ully. as well as a 
support structure, for IP?\ 
uale' successes. Fhcic tv Eu^ciic H,udmg. Plwlo EdKor

Peace Corps volunteers should begin application 

Interested students must apply up to a year in advance 



Students who are thinking ol 
serving in the Peace Corps should 
start the application process now il 
Ihey would like to begin wilh Ihe 
PeaceCorps Ihis summer, according 
lo Scot Roskelley, a spokesman lor 
Ihe regional Peace Corps office in 

The application process can 
easily take nine months lo a year, he 
says. There us one person ivho has 
attended IPFW wlio is currently 
serving in the Peace Corps, Over 
the their 41-year history, 15 people 
from IPRV have served 

Interest in the Peace Corps is 
up considerably, Roskelley says, 
Thciehast&gt;eena 17 percent increase 
in Ihe number of applications com- 
pared to last year. Also, ivcb traffic 
is up 231 pcreent this year and 
inquiricsareup43 percent, he adds, 

"Seniors arcn'l finding as 
many job opportunities as Ihev 
were last year. The lacklu 
market has partially contril 
the interest in Peace Corps," 
Roskelley says, 

"However. President Bush 






lor 






Americans lo do volunteer work, 
and in his State of the Union 
Address Ihis year, indicated that he 
wants to double the number of 
Peace Corps volunteers in Ihe next 
five years. This has also had an 
impact on the number ol volun- 
teers." Roskelley added. 

Peace Corps requires a 27- 

Volunleeis receive a monthly stipend 
to cover housing, food anrf inciden- 
tals. Health insurance is also paid for 
during that service commitment. 

Upon completion of service, 
volunteers are given slightly over 
S6,IX)0 that can be used to re-estab- 
lish themselves upon return lo the 
United Stales, or for travel abroad. 

Relumed volunteers also have 
enhanced hiring status for federal gov- 
enmient jobs for one year following 
completion of Peace Corps service. 

The Peace Corps is looking for 
college gradualcs wilh a wide vari- 
ety of backgrounds and degrees to 
serve in 70 countries around the 
world. A commilmeni lo service is 



Ihe biggest pre-requisile. 

Roskelley says Peace Corps 
assigrunenls fall under several cate- 
gories; education (looking for peo- 
ple who are certified teachers as 
well as those with an interest in 
teachmg), as well as people with a 
degree in any discipline and strong 
leadership skills. 

"We have a particular need for 
people who have taken French 
classes — even a year or two. We 
have posts in countries in the 
Caribbean and West Africa where 
French is the predominant lan- 
guage. Even though we provide 
intensive language training for any 
location during Ihe first three 
months of sen.1ce, we like lo have 
people wilh some previous French 
training." Roskelley says. 

Peace Corps recruiters are 
traveling throughout the slale this 
fall giving presentations about Ihe 
Corps. For a schedule of recruiting

Letters to the Editor 

Computer lab courtesy in need of improvement 



I had a disconccrling e«pe- 
rience in Ihc compuler lab on 
Thuisday, Sepl. 19. I decided ro 
check my email and do some 
homework between classes. 
When I logged on. I discovcicd 
Ihat this particular computer had 
AOL Instanl Messenger (AIM). 

Since not all of the comput- 
ers seem to have chal programs 
on Ihcm, 1 was pleasantly sur- 
prised and decided to see if any 
of my (amily or friends were 
online before I proceeded, 

I didn'l see anyone, so I 
logged oul of thai program and 
went into Intemel Explorer to do 
whal I'd come in (or. II wasn't 
thai simple, however.

peculiarly worded note from an

Somehow my AIM account 
name and password had stayed 
on the lab compuler, even alter I 
had logged oul of il and my 
school user account. Olher peo- 
ple had been logging on lo my

had chatted with al least Iwo 
people (one of which was a very, 



shall &lt;

esting-;c. 



tralors only talked lo two peo- 
ple); however. 1 am confused as 
to how this information slaved 
in the computer after I nad 



ilely changed my 
passwords for both AIM and 
AOL. and I had to send mes- 
sages or emails lo everyone on 
my buddy list (well over 50 peo- 
ple) telling Ihcm what happened 
and lo disregard any messages 
that mighlhavecome from "me" 
that day. Those people included 
friends, family, acquaintances 
and business clients. 

I am thankful Ihal notfung

pened lo the Golden Rule? 



Writer finds flaws in 'From the Left' 



°r:x 



In Ihe Sepl. I) issue, a col- 
umn enlitled "Patriotism from 
the Left" by Penny Tsigulolf 
attempled to convmce us that 
the government m general (and 
George Bush in particular) are 
simply ivar-mongcrs who eager- 
ly disregard Ihe opinions of Ihe 
public — especially in mailers of 
terrorism. I have lo t ' 
with Penny's column 
because her ramblings 
ficull to follow, but also due to 
the several factual inaccuracies I 
noted in the piece. 

For instance. Tsiguloff stat- 
ed, "...despite Ihe protest of its 
citizens and many foreign lead- 
ers. President Bush wants to 
begin a new war against Iraq." t 
agree Ihal no sane person wants 
a war. However, a CBS 
News/New York Times poll 
laken from Sept. 2-5 of this year 

approved of the United Stales 
taking military action against 
Iraq lo remove Saddam Hussem. 
ftecenlly. Great Britain also 
added its support lo this cause. 
Alter President Bush's speech to 
the United Natioiu about the 
military capabilities of Iraq, I 
eipcct many more loreign lead* 
erslojoin this list. 

Another example of an 

Tsiguloll's idea that "Since 9/11, 
our govenunent has cut both 
Medicare and Medicaid reim- 
bursements." She wants us lo 
believe thai President Bush and 
the government of our country 
are closing nursing homes and 
leaving our elderly in the streets 
to finance Ihe war on terrorism. 
According lo government 
figures, the spending lor 
Medicare and Medicaid was 
actually increased for Ihe fiscal 



year 2(X)2, which began in Oct. 
2001 — less than one month alter 
Ihe lerrorist attacks. This budget 
IS scheduled to mcrease in fiscal 
year 2003 as well. 

Additionally, the column 
claims, "We have bombed 
Afghanistan, killing hundreds of 
civilians, and slill nave no idea 
where our enemy is." As a for- 
mer member of the United Stales 
Army. I can certamly tell you 
Ihat every effort is made lo avoid 
civilian casualties and lo only 
attack military targets. I loo 
regret the loss of innocent life in 
A%hanislati. Lei us nol forget, 
however, thai there were nearly 
3.000 iruiocent civilians in the 
World Trade Center who were 
specifically targeted by our 
enemy. Their anger is not direct- 
ed al our government, bul al the 
citizens themselves. 

It also bears mentioning 
that we did know where our 
e.iemy was before the first bomb 
dropped in Afghanistan. We 
asked the Afghan government to 
give us Osama Bin Laden and 
the Al-Qaeda operatives who we 
knew were lesponsiblc (or the 
9/11 atrocity. iTus war and all 
the civilian deaths could have 
been avoided if the request was 
accommodated. With total disre- 
gard (or the safety of its own cit- 
izens, the Taliban govemmenl 
refused this request, knowing an 
armed conflict would result. 
The war allowed many of the 
perpetrators of the altack on 
America to slip into hiding. 
They did this because they were 
a truly corrupt government, 
bought and paid for by none 
other than Osama Bin Laden 
himself. 

Ms. Tsiguloff dedicated sev- 
eral paragraphs of her column lo 



equalily. 



the hghl against oppression in 
the United States. I will be the 
firsi to recognise the heroic 
efforts of both Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. and Rosa 
(ight for racial 
However, Iraqi minormes are 
among the most oppressed peo- 
ple in Ihe world. Political oppo- 
nents and foreien prisoners are 
executed with alarming regulari- 
ty. Citizens guilty o( minor 
offenses are imprisoned and 
forced to watch as their loved 
ones are inhumanely tortured. 
Women are raped and disfigured 
(or amusement. I&gt;aruel Pearl was 
kidnapped and murdered in bar- 
baric fashion simply because of 
his religion. Yes, there are 
oppressive goverrmicnls in Ihe 
world, but I nardly think ours is 
one of Ihcm, 

The column also misrepre- 
sents the justification for military 
action against Iraq^ "The reason: 
harboring terrorists. Or, is il real- 
ly Ihe control of oil?" There is no 
logic in this statement. Even if 
Ihe United States attacks Iraq 






^ the current gi 



the oil does nol

member of OPEC; anci that 
organization will control, the 
price and availability of oil.

Arab allies who oppose military 



n that the ei 



;ult will be 



price lag. Truly, if we do attack 
Saddam Hussein, II will nol be 
because of oil, but in spite of it. 

Finally, I would like lo men- 
tion the real reason that the pres- 
ident and most Americans feel 
Ihal military action is justified 
agair\sl Iraq: Weaporw of mass 
destruction. 



Saddam Hussein, as a con- 
dition of ending the Gulf War, 
agreed lo completely dismantle 
his nuclear, biological and chem- 
ical weapons program. Several 
B:ars ago. Iraq expelled all of the 
nited Nations weapon irupec- 
tors before they could verify that 
this had taken place. All current 
intelligence indicates that 
Saddam is rebuilding his chemi- 
cal and biological weaporu 
stockpile and is close lo obtain- 
ing nuclear weapons. Lei me 
repeal that. Saddam Hussein is 
trying to get nuclear weapons! 

I want peace as much as 
you do. Ms. iTsiguloff. 1 wani lo 
be able lo forgive those who per- 
petrated Ihose horrendous 
attacks on America. Forgiveness, 
however, has a prc-rcquisite of

I was wailing outside for my class to start Ihe other day when 

Iremcndously loud sound echoed down the hallway of Kettler's 

basement floor. Nol more than two minules later, three wheely 

backpacks went rushing by being pulled furiously by Iheii oivners.

asked a girl in my class. She had the nerve to say whal 1 was Ihmk-

I would also like to note that wheely backpacks arc a danger- 
ous weapon. Nol only are they heavy rolling objects that can easi- 
ly glide over ones toes, crushing them to the point of numbness, 
bul they can also cause tall people, like myself, lo Irip quite often. 

Here is the scenario, a person whips around a comer at a high 
rate of speed, dragging behind them a load of bricks — I'm sony 
— a rolling pack. I am looking ahead inio the sea of students fleck- 
ing from their previous class when SMACK, I am hil and tripped 
by the wheeling backpack. Down I go, 15 pound bookbag and all. 
Do I receive an apology from Ihe wheeling backpack person? NO. 
Irislead I receive a look that says, "You should've been paying 
attention." I feel that they should be paying attention where Ihey 
are pulling their "bookbags." 

When it comes lo rolling backpacks, all il comes down lo is 
laziness on the part of most of the students (those who are pregnant 
or have a severe physical disability arc allowed to roll). These are 
the same students who will someday be wheely backpacking

Al limes during Uie IPFW Invitalional. 
Ihe Dons appeared lo be on lop ol Iheir game. 
Moments laler, Ihey would be in chaos. 

"I was disappointed we couldn't main* 
tain any type ol consistency." Hartley said. 
"It's like ihi^re are two different teams that 
show up not just day-to-day but game-lo- 
game and even stretches of live points." 

The Mastodons opened their own invila- 
iLonal Friday by keeping pace with eventual 
invitational winner wngnt State before falling 
in three close games 30-27, 34-32, 30-21. 

IPFWIhen won a sloppy match over 
Western Illinois Saturday morning 30-25, 30- 
28. 30-16 and dropped a four-game hearl- 
brcaker lo Matquetto 30-23, 21-30, 26-30. 30-32 
Saturday night. 

Wright State finished the weekend unde- 
feated to lake Ihe trophy. Marquette placed sec- 
ond, followed by [PHV and Western Illinois, 

The Dons' Janclle Pollard was named to 
the All-Toumament leam with an impressive 
showing in the final match. 



"Janellc was instrumental al the end." 
Hartley said. 'I was yelling lor Lindi 
|Bankowski| lo Tmd Janclle because you could

end.Shejuslhad a pretty good tournament lor us." 

The MMlodons played sluggi^ly against 
Western Illinois, and although she was happy lo 
get a victory. Hartley was making no excuses, 

"Western Illinois played this morning, 
too, so I'm not going to make Ihe excuse of 
playing in Ihe morning," Hartley said. "Our 
team sometimes just isn't ready lo play. We've 
been unready lo play in the evenmgs and in 
Ihe altemoon, sometimes in practice. We're 
just not always ready lo play." 

Againsl Marquette, the Dons got off lo 
the start they were looking for but fell behind 
in the second and IhinJ games. 

In Ihe fourth game, IPFW found itself 
down 29-23, but Mo MeirOiart served the 
Mastodons back to 29-29 with the help of /our 
kills from Pollard.

pickel fence. 
farm Iraclor This could all be 
yours, if you have a boosler at 
your college. 

Thai was the subjecl of Ihi" 
1994 film "Blue Chips." Sure it 
made /or j good laugh ot two, but 
ll happens today in nearly all of 
our colleges. 

So is the idea of boosters 
comical to you? If so, maybe you 
should have a little talk with 
Chris Webber. 

Webber has become a 
household name in the last sev- 
eral years, bul never has he been 
more mentioned than in the last 



six or seven monlHs 

Webber began his stoned 
career at the University of 
Michigan in 1991. He entered the 
NBA draft in 1993 and has been 
playing in Ihe league ever since. 
It was jusi last year Webber was 
fusl alb^ to have accepted rnoncj'. 

Former Michiean booster 
Ed Martin claimed he loaned 
$280,000 to Webber while he was 
slill an amateur playmg lor the 
Michigan Wolverines, 

Since when is it wrong to 
accept a loan from someone? Is it 
illegal lo accept a loan? Not in 
this country. It's not even illegal 
to tntcniionallv accept money 
from a booster because you play 
on a college team. 

So why the grand jury? 
What docs the Uniled Stales gov- 
emmenl have to do ivilh the way 
Martin and Webber spend their 
money? ll doesn'l mate sense. 

Webber denied the allega- 
tions in front of a grand jury on 
March 30, In the followine 
weeks and months, Martin slat- 
ed that he had given moncv lo 



several oiher Michigan players. 
Robert Tr^ylor and Louis Bullock 
admitted to accepting lar^e 
amounts of money from Marlin 
while they were at Michigan. 

Marlin also said he gave 
money to Maurice Taylor, and 
Jalcn Rose admillcd to accepting 
"pocket money" from Marlin, 

So maybe the FBI and the 
federal govemmeni should 
focus on a different aspect of this 
investigation. Exactly where does 
a man come up with S616J»0 to 
give lo college athletes? And 
those are only the loans Ihal we 
have heard about. 

So where does Marlin gel 
his money? It seems to me that 
any reasonable member of Ihe 
federal government could come 
up with this ctuestion. then again 
I have never thought very highly 
of the ivay our government con- 
duels business. 

On Sept. 9, Webber was 
mdicled on charges of obstruc- 
tion of justice and lying lo a 
grand |ury. That's great, another 
step in the wrong direction lor 



our wonderful justice system. 

We continue lo Icl convict- 
ed murderers go free because we 
lack Ihe facililics lo contain all 

Eirisoners, yel we want to send 
Vebber to prison for 10 years for 
something that can't be proven. 
And why does the fedeml 
goverrunenl think Webber is 
guilty? Just because Thiylor and 
Bullock admitted to accepting Ihe 
money, does Ihal aulomalicatly 
make Webber guilty? 

Here is anodier curveball 
for you. If accepting money from 
a booster is not illegal and the 
person who accepted the money 
would not be brought up on any 
charges, why would they deny 
that they tooV it? 

The only logical reason I 
could think of to lie about this is 



a los 



1 this situation? It he 









Now, I am a Webber fan. bi 
far too late for him to keep a pos- 
itive teputabon. This is a man who 
has been arrested numerous times 
for possession of illegal drugs and 
dnving while intoxicated. 

So what does Webber have 



jke the 

happens lo him as far as criminal 
proceedings. But if he did lake it, 
why would he lie about it? What 
does Webber have lo protect? 

ll all comes doivr to who 
the federal courts believe. It's 
Martin's word against Webber's. 

Webber's problems will not 
be the only legal issues that arise 
from the situation. Now that 
Ttaylor and Bullock have both 
staled that Ihe booster allega- 
tions ate true, the University of 
Michigan is under review. 

■The Ihreal lo Ihe Wfolverincs 
15 clear. Most likely, Michigan \vill 
be banned from tournament play 
lor five lo 10 years. 

In addition, the NCAA has 
decided Ihal they will most likely 
have all Michigan resulls stricken 
from the record books during 
V\tbber's tenure. 

Basically, Michigan
