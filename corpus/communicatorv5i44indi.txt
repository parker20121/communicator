Senate passes 
activity budgets 



The Student Senate of 1973-74 
concluded business Wednesday by 
passing on all of the budgets for next 
year. In approving budgets for the 
up-coming year, the Senate has spent 
just over $88,000 for funding all of the 
various programs paid for by the $15 
activity fee. 

The major increase experienced 
by a fee recipient was to the Student 
Government office Account for 
"74-75, as it was upped by $22,900 from 
last year. Most of the rise was traced 
to a $10,000 appropriation for tennis 
courts and $12,400 for buying the 
student newspaper next year. 

The Film Series budget for next 
year was_another big winner in the 
race for funding. The budget was 
increased by $1,500, most of it to 
enable the series to employ a 
projectionist. 

Those scoring lesser gains for 
1974-75 were the Student Activities 
Office account with a $176 raise, 
Purdue-Indiana Theatre increased by 
$2,665 and the Impressions magazine 

Nightwear must 
indicate flammabilrty 

All children's nightwear manu- 
factured from Jan. 1, 1974, and on sale 
in Australia must carry labels 
indicating flammability risk, mark- 
ing an important step toward 
lowering burn deaths, says Australian 
Minister for Science Bill Morrison. 

In 1972, 62 children spent an 
average 25 days in the Royal 
Children's Hospital in Australia 
undergoing treatment for clothing 



with a budget $1,500 higher than last 

Perhaps the surprise of the 
budgetary sessions was found within 
the budget of the Student Union 
Board. After approving a supplemen- 
tal allocation of approximately $2,000 
to fund the Harbor-Arbor Days 
concert, the Senate cut next year's 
request by over $7,800. While most of 
the slash was in the area of supplies 
needed for next year, the Senate also 
cut funding for two concerts from the 



request for a $4,0 

A possible controversy arose over 
the budget passed by the Senate for 



Student's Government, however, &lt; 
decreased to $500 to be released "If, 
and only if the Joint Athletic 
Committee will allocate not less than 
$1,000" for the organization to use. 

It was felt by the Senators that 
since the PISS is an intercollegiate 
sport, the JAC should help fund it. 

Students' Government officials 
expressed pleasure with the new 
budgets just enacted. 

I feel that the budgets for next 



money," said John Gerber, chairman 
of the Appropriations Committee. His 
feelings were echoed by Senators and

Jack M. Ryder, vice chancellor 
and dean of administrative affairs at 
Indiana University-Purdue Univer-

candidate for super-chancellor to be 
inlerviewed on campus. Ryder was at 
Indiana-Purdue last Thursday and 
Friday.

job. The presidents, however, 

not bound to having to select one of 

the committee's choices. 

In a meeting with Indiana-Purdue 
students, Friday, Ryder said, 
"this campus cannot be viewed as a 
regional campus anymore. It is like 
an independent university..." He 
added that he feels the campus should 
be unified with an autonomous 
faculty. 

Ryder would not accept the 
position of super-chancellor unless his 
responsibilities would be set forth in 
writing. He also said that as 
condition of his appointment, he must 
be able to select his own business 
manager. He termed the possibility of 
having a business manager that did 
not answer to the super -chancellor 
but rather Purdue Lafayette as 
completely "not acceptable" to him. 

Concerning other academic prob- 
lems. Ryder said that local initiative 
is a must. "There should be no central 
dean controlling us from some other 
city." 

Ryder received his Ph.D. in 1962 
from Michigan State University in 
Educational Administration. From 
1952 until 1954 he taught in the 
Anglo-American Schools in Athens, 
Greece. In 1954 he became a graduate 
teaching assistant at MSU. Then in 
1961 he became an assistant instruc- 
tor. He received his administra- 
tive experience when he served as 
principal of the Anglo-American 
schools. In 1955 he was the 
superintendent of schools at the 
Brady Community Schools near 
Saginaw, Michigan. In 1957 he

dean of University Extension Admini- 
stration at Purdue University in 
Lafayette. At that time he held the 
rank of associate professor. From 
1963 until 1966 he was director of 
Purdue University at Indianapolis. 
He also served as interim director for 
Ivy Technical Institute from 1964 until 
1965. From 1966 until 1969 he was the

Women's studies courses unnounced 



Out of a desire for i 
informality in which both students 
and faculty can participate and share 
new perspectives has grown the 
Women's Studies Committee. This 
group, currently numbers 16 women 
from the campus community. 

The Women's Studies Committee 
is a totally voluntary group of people 
who have taught or taken courses in 
women's studies or are interested in 
learning and sharing ideas in this 
area. The group is open to all 
interested in creative thinking. 

The key themes are openness, 
sharing, caring, involvement, and 
dedication to the great need felt for

Center for the Study of the Person. 
The latter program is currently 
offering a course entitled, Exploring 
the Female Experience to a class of 26 
(21 women and 5 men) plus numerous 
non-enrolled but very interested 
onlooker-participants. This course 
has run the gamut of such topics as 
the place of women in religion, 
history, the arts, and philosophy, to 
femal sexuality, female societal 
roles, birth control, abortion, parent-

Course facilitators are Micki 
Kepes, Kathy Mettler, and Alice 
Scott. Exploring the Female Experi- 
ence provides an arena in which 
students can encounter ideas from a 
myriad of sources: assigned reading, 
films, guest speakers, traditional 
lectures, small and large group 
discussions and presentations of 
student course projects. 

There are four fall 1974 course 
offering in Women's Studies at 
Indiana-Purdue. Exploring the Fe- 
male Experience will again be offered 
as PHIL.493-2, although it was 
inadvertently omitted from next fall's 
schedule of classes. Facilitators for 
this course will be Micki Kepes and 
Peggy WeJlin. 

Ann Ladd will teach FR-266, 
Women in French Literature. Writers 
included will be Colette, Duras, 
Sarraute, LeDuc, James, and Woolf. 
Kathy Mettler and Alice Scott will 
be facilitators for Three Feminist 
Profiles: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, 
Virginia Woolf, and Robin Morgan. 
The course number is PHIL493-1. 

The Psychology of the Female

in society. It will be taught by Cathryn

have proven to be the ones which 
cause the student the most difficulty. 
A student, Lu Hurley, stated it in the 
following way: "Typing is all right 
the way it is because it isn't difficult 
to grasp; it is a skill one can acquire 
with practice. Accounting involves 
more theory than typing; it would be

The key to sucess in the CAVE is 
definitely self-motivation. A student 
must practice self-discipline in order 
to obtain the best results from his 
work. As another accounting major 
phrased it, "The CAVE is good only 
for self-motivated students. Unfor- 
tunately, there aren't enough among 
us. I think the student should be given 
the choice between a class or the 
CAVE." This suggestion may seem 
ideal, but it is not practical since the 
Division of General and Technical 
Studies (DGTS) does not have the 
faculty for the number of classes this 
would require. However, in the fall, 
DGTS will offer a special accounting 
class which will utilize both the 
classroom and the CAVE. It will be 
available to students who meet 
certain requirements set up by the 
accounting department. Also, the

Speaking 



What we want 



Autonomy. That is what it is all about these days; all the furor at 
IU-PU centers on the issue of autonomy. 

Autonomy can be defined in terms of self-governance. In our case, it 
means the right and responsibility to make local decisions at the local 
level. It implies a high degree of decentralization in the administrative 
structures of the two universities. 

A second factor of autonomy for IU-PU is the necessity of unification. 
If we are to make our decisions, we must have one clearly defined line of 
command in the decision-making process. We certainly cannot act 
autonomously without a single campus head and a unified structure of 
subordinate officers. 

Autonomy means that we have a high degree of self-sufficiency and a 
minimal dependence on Lafayette and Bloomington. We must also have a 
merged administrative and academic structure for this autonomy to be 
meaningful. 

We can achieve autonomy under (wo different sets of circumstances. 
Both of these are being discussed in depth on campus. 

We can go independent. We will become Fort Wayne State University 
or some such thing, and have no ties whatsoever with I. U. or Purdue. This 
is autonomy in the purest sense. 

This route may be the ultimate answer for IU-PU and many other 
regional campuses. To be forced into such a situation at this point in time, 
however, could prove very counterproductive. We will have to walk 
before we have really learned to crawl. 

Our reputation in the Fort Wayne community and in the local job 
market, where most IU-PU students go to work, would not be harmed. It 
may even be strengthened by community pride. But outside the Fort 
Wayne area, we will have little or not credibility for quite some time. 

The future more than likely holds independence for this and other 
campuses. The change-over must come through evolution rather than 
revolution for the protection of all involved. 

The second form of autonomy is a high degree of self-determination 
within the I.U. and Purdue systems. When someone on campus talks 
about autonomy, this option two is most generally what he means. 

Under this approach, Indiana-Purdue University at Fort Wayne 
remains--or becomes-- exactly that. The campus is no longer treated as 
an extension center of Bloomington and Lafayette. Our relation to the 
main campuses would become one similar to that between UCLA and 
Berkeley. 

With this arrangement we have academic autonomy to develop 
programs that are needed locally; we have a complete unification of 
administrative and academic structures; and we are not at the mercy of 
the Lafayette Business Office. Most people on campus would gladly 
accept this alternative. Many of these are endorsing independence 
because they feel that the two universities will not allow any meaningful 
autonomy for this campus. 

Expressed in its crudest form, the IU-PU community is giving the 
universities an ultimatum: give us true autonomy within the system, or 
we will separate. This newspaper still clings to the hope that the 
presidents have sensed this ultimatum and that they will grant us 
autonomy-in the best interests of I.U , Purdue, and the Fort Wayne 
campus. 



Harbor Arbor Days 



Harbor Arbor Days were observed this past weekend, and this year's 
activities were easily the best since those of the late 1960's. 

Harbor Arbor Days are the spring festival that comes on or near the 
last weekend in April each year. The Days emphasize outside activity as 
a relaxing contrast to the inside activity of semester finals. 

The Days have been going downhill since the 1967-68 era of student 
involvement in nearly everything. Students' interests have narrowed 
considerably since that time, and the social planners have not been able 
to compensate for this change in mood. 

That is. until this year. The newly established Pig Roast, with 
donations going to the XGI scholarship fund, was very well attended. The 
Film Orgy was shown to capacity-plus crowds. And the rock concert was 
a tremendous success, as illustrated by the picture below. 

Police estimated the crowd at 10,000 or more. Surprisingly, the 
majority of these were not teeny-boppers, but college age people. The fact 
o trouble attests to the emotional and physical maturity 



that there v 
of the crowd. 

The only black spot on the weekend's record was the unbelievable 
mess that was left all over campus-and we mean allover. A 
commendable clean-up effort headed by Student Body President Rusty 
Cane and Dean Jack Ulmer took care of most of the mess Sunday. 

the Students' Government has a year to figure out the many things it 
did right this time and the few things it did wrong. If the newly elected 
government is perceptive, we can expect another good Harbor Arbor 
Days next spring. 



Oil crisis case 
of over-reaction 



By DR. GEORGE C. ROCHE III 

An international pattern is beginn- 
ing to emerge in the so-called "energy 
crisis, ' ' and that pattern is not 
reassuring. 

The economist reports that some 70 
per cent of Sweden's energy origin- 
ales in domestically produced hydro- 
electric power. As a result, Swedish 
oil stocks have not been diminished by 
the current embargo and no rationing 
should have been required. Swedes 
have been disgusted to learn, 
however, that the bureaucracy has 
imposed the most stringent rationing 



Swedish character. Whatever the 
Swedes might think of that, the facts 
remain that the planners have 
imposed rationing absolutely without 
necessity, all in the name of an 
imagined "crisis." 

Meanwhile, the crisis in England is 
far from imaginary. Columnist 
Anthony Lejeune reports from Lon- 
don that, "Across the Channel, 
Britain's new partners in the 
European Economic Community... 
watched in astonishment as the 
incomprehensible British made a 
catastrophe out of an oil shortage 
which was, for them, simply an 
inconvenience.. .an unholy combinat- 
ion of Arab oil sheiks with militant 
British coal miners, train drivers, and 
electrical engineers is producing i 






The 






absolutely no regard for the effect o 
the national economy, have taken 
various forms of 'industrial action' in 
an attempt to break 'Stage III' of the 
government's price-and-incomes pol- 
icy. The result is a lack of coal for the 
power stations, a lack of trains to 
carry such coal as is produced, and a 
lack of engineers to operate sophisti- 



offices would be allowed to 
electric only three days a week. ..The 
Chancellor of the Exchequer, a 
shivering British public was told, 
would shortly announce a grim 
'minibudget.' " 

Here at home we are doing little 
better. Petroleum shortages generat- 
ed by the government price fixing 
have quickly spread to shortages in 
other vital items. More workers are 
laid off, more shelves are empty, 
truckers announce their unwilling- 
ness to continue hauling in the present 
price-distorted situation. As govern- 
ment regulation of prices dries upi 
available supplies. We find ourselves' 
caught between rising prices and 
failing supplies. We then blame one 
another for this turn of events and 
begin a series of strikes and 
showdowns which are guaranteed to I 
aggravate the problem. 

As one of the nation's brightest 
young economists, Alan Reynolds, 
recently put it, "Politicians control 
the price of beef and find we have not 
only a shortage of beef and freezers, 
but of substitute meats and of tallow 
used to make candles, soap and 
rubber. Politicians control the price 
of steel pipe, so there isn't any 
available for drilling oil wells. 
Politicians control the price of natural 
gas and discover that everyone 
abandons costly coal, and that the 
shortage of natural gas creates a 
shortage of bricks (dried by gas) and 
fertilizer. Politicians control the price 



The energy shortage is only one of 
many shortages, and if we are to turn 
to rationing every time demand 
exceeds supply by 10-20 percent at the 
controlled price, we will soon be 
rationing nearly everything. The idea 
that poverty can be solved by keeping 
prices at a level that discourages 
production and encourages waste is 
simply ludicrous." 

Earlier I mentioned a pattern which 
was now developing in the internat- 
ional "energy crisis." Whether we see 
rationing and shortages imposed 
needlessly by the bureaucracy (as in 
Sweden) or as a desperation measure 
by a government already deeply 
entangled in the failures of bureau- 
cratic controls over prices, product- 
ion and distribution (as in England 
and the United States), the same old 
government itch to run the business of 
all men remains all too evident. 

The cycle of regulation, inflation, 
price control, shortages and rationing 
seems to repeat itself endlessly. The 
only surprise is how gullible we seem 
to be the next time when politicians 
promise to "save" us from our 
problems with another dose of the 
same governmental medicine which 
has already made our economy so 




At least. Hoover knew how to run a depressk

Concsiousness raised 



By AUDREY GELLIS 

Consumer-controlled medicine is 
the newest idea whose time has come. 

Our medical system today is a 
dictatorship of, for and by doctors. 
Most health care is on a fee-for-ser- 
vice basis and it's the doctor who sets 
up the fee. Usually, it's what the 
traffic will bear. 

Furthermore, the doc tor- patient 
relationship is one of God-priest-par- 
ent to ignorant child. We patients 
know nothing of our medical histories 
except what our doctors choose to tell 
us; ours not to question why, ours 
simply to blindly obey "doctor's 
orders" whether it be for drugs, 
surgery or simply benign neglect. 

This is changing, however, and the 
change has been sparked by the 
Women's Movement which, as women 
demanded control over their bodies, 
focused attention on medical care. 
Ultimately, this raised consciousness 
will affect every woman, man and 
child in the country. 

What may very well be a pilot 
program for future health care has 
been launched by the National

often do they go without gynecological

The clinic is located in a modest- 
rental area instead of a prestigious 
high-rent address. Under this one roof 
are ultramodern procedure rooms, 
x-ray room and laboratory as well as 
a cheerful waiting lounge. 

The $90 annual fee was arrived at 
by dividing the projected budget 
(staff, equipment, overhead, etc.) by 
the projected patient load ($360,000 by 

In addition to putting medicine on a 
nonprofit basis the clinic features a 
patient's bill of rights which makes a 
woman an equal participant with the 
medical clinic personnel in her 
personal health care. 

Every patient has access to all 
medical information about herself 
including history, diagnosis, x-rays, 
test results and drug data. Before any 
drug is administered, she is informed 
of all contra-indications and possible 
side effects. No treatment is under- 
taken without her informed consent, 
which is defined as complete 
information on all the available 
options and their consequences. 

Other patient-centered innovations 
include a cooperative pharmacy 



where prescriptions are filled at cost. 
And 10 per cent of everyday 's 
bookings is left open for emergencies 
(acute anxiety of physical discomfort 
are classified as emergencies). '"' 

Merle Goldberg is now in the 
process of setting up similar clinics'in 
Los Angelos and in Mississippi. She is 
also helping women throughout the 
country to start their own consumer- 
controlled medical cooperatives. 

Unlike other prepaid medical plans 
which are doctor controlled, women 
who set up their own clinics can also 
set down the conditions. According to 
Goldberg, as few as 100 women within 
a town or community can start a 
women's health center; all that is 
really essential is a core of 10 
dedicated women who are willing, to 
make a commitment to the work 
involved.

NFL IN A HEAP OF TROUBLE 

The National Football League Players' 
(NFLPA) recently submitted a list of over 50 demands to 
the league owners. At first the owners just laughed at the 
demands. But now they are realizing that it's no matter for 
jest: a long bitter struggle looms ahead in the coming 
weeks, with the result of a full-scale players' strike a 
distinct possibility. 

The fledgling World Football League, the NFL's new 
rival (and a formidable one), could well hold the key to all: 
close to 500 NFL athletes will be playing out their options 
during the 1974-75 campaign. The NFL owners certainly 
must be feeling increased pressure and apprehension due to 
the defections of Ted Kwalick, Virgil Carter. Ken Stabler, 
Darryl Lamonica. Calvin Hill, and of course Zonk, Jim 
Kiick and Paul Warfield.

The NFL could easily be 
and players fail to 
compromise. And negotiation 
slow pace. 

Players jumping to the WFL already are expressing a 
high level of optimism toward the league's future. The 
league's organizer and mastermind, Gary Davidson, 
successfully led the way for the American Basketball 
Association and the World Hockey Association. And he I ia- 
a group of seemingly competent and level-headed team 
lers to back him up. 

With that backbone, the NFL is definitely in a heap oi 
trouble. But bv hoarding all of their revenue and not sharing 
the bounty with their employees in the last decade, they 

e than asked for it. 

Virgil Carter, who was more than happy to depart Iron, 
the NFL outlines another impressive reason pointing to ilu 
ultimate success of the WFL: "The kickoffs will be made 
from the 30 yard line instead of the 40. which means the 
offense should have field position immediately. Instead oi 
the great number of kickoffs going deep in the end zone, 
unreturnable, they'll be run back. We are also going i&lt;&gt; haw 
toward the line of scrimmage, as the 
Canadian League does. There will be no fair catches on 
punts. Instead the coverage team will have to give thi 
returner five yards, as the Canadian League does Bui we'U 
also have downfield blocking, which should help put one of 
xciting plays back into the game." 
rule changes will definitely make the WFL 
games more exciting and will enhance its chances for 
becoming the second effective rival to the NFL. Bui the 
pending war between the players and owners of the NFL is 
still the top item being closely watched by all. 

The NFL players may take a good thing too far. though, 

and wind up with nothing. Some of their demands may be a 

Among other demands, they want to have the 

following items eliminated entirely: the option clause in 

- liver system, all fines and the 

imissioner's rights in disciplining players. 

The NFL owners say that they will not even consider 

above changes. Many players say that they will
