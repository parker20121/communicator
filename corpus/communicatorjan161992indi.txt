NEWS BRIEFS 

SNOW SHUTS DOWN 
CAMPUS TUESDAY 

Even Don Kauer can't remember ihe last lime IPFW 
was closed for a day due to the weather. 

Kalter. ihc director of the Physical Plant, said "It's 
been a few years" since the school was closed for 
weather reasons. Kaiter said he couldn't recall a date 
for sure. 

The decision to shut down IPFW for the day Tuesday 
was made before six a.m. by Richard Ritchie, Vice 
Chancellor of Financial Affairs. When Ritchie is faced 
with a school closure decision he is aided by recom- 
mendations from Katter and the IPFW police depart- 
ment, 

Kalter said the decision to close the campus was 
made to protect the students, "Wc chose to close down 
today because of the intensity of the snow storm this 
morning. If you looked outside today you might won- 
der why we closed. But once you drop it's hard to get 
people back in." 

"We could have had school today but a lot of students 
would have been at risk," Katter said. 



IPFW PREPARES FOR FUTURE 
WEATHER EMERGENCIES 

If the area should be struck by another snow storm in 
the future. IPFW will again be ready. 

Although university officials attempt to keep IPFW 
fully operational during adverse weather, occasionally 
they will suspend campus operations. Two types of 
weather suspensions are possible - a weather emergen- 
cy and a weather recess. 

During a weather emergency, classes are cancelled 
but all other activities continue. During an IPFW 
weather emergency, all non-insiructional staff should 
report to work. Special parking restrictions may be 
imposed, according to university officials. 

During a weather recess like we had Tuesday, all 
non-critical IPFW operatons are suspended. Designat- 
ed essential personnel are required to work during a 
weather recess, but students and all ether employees 
should vacate the premises or not come to campus. 

Listen to local radio and television news for future 
IPFW weather related closings or call the campus 
weather emergency information number, 481-6050. 
Whenever possible, university officials said that 
announcements will be made by 6:30 a.m. for daytime 
activities and by 3 p.m. for evening activities. 



PROFESSOR'S WORK 
TO BE EXHIBITED 

An exhibition of paintings by Norman Bradley will 
be on display in the gallery of the fine arts building 
from Februrary 10 to March 8. Bradley is a tenured 
associate professor of fine arts. 

Bradley teaches painting and an history, including a 
course on the art of pre-Columbian America. 

According to Bradley his work has taken new direc- 
tions. " The European aspect of the "old world" is 
really the "new" of my work. That is, modem abstract 
art as it has evolved in the 20th century and as it has 
influenced me." 

In conjuction with Bradley's show, "Fruedian Slip- 
pers," a display of shoes from around the world will be 
shown in the gallery case. The collection is owned by 
Jaleh Fazel, an associate faculty member of the fine 
arts department.

Snyder, Green resign from senate; avoid impeachment 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

Embniilcd student senators 
Mark Snydet and Sally Green 
have had enough. 

Snyder and Green both 
resigned at the end of last 
semester rather than continue 
wrestling through the web of 
IPSGA impeachment proceed- 
ings. 

Snyder and Green were 
charged with several conduct 
violaiions by IPSGA's internal 



affairs commiliec last fall. The 
senators were to be tried for 
impeachment in November but 
several trial dales were bumped 
back by a slow moving IPSGA 
judicial committee. The latest 
lri.il date for the impeachment 
hearings has been slated for laler 
this month. 

Even though Snyder and 
Green are out now. Ihe 
impeachment ptocedings will 
continue for ^^'ancy Barger. She 
was the ihird senator charged 



for impeachment in November. 
Barger has expressed no plans 
to resign, according to Marian 
Adair, Dean of Students and 
advisor to IPSGA. 

It was Adair who accepted the 
Idlers of resignation from Sny- 
der and Green in December. 

Snyder said he quit because 
he'd had enough of the system. 
"I've always tended to be out- 
side fighting the system. But 
some people suggested that I try 
fighting from within the sys- 




Even Ihougli Monday's wnnler itorm played havoc with .student schedules, it did render lovely 
scenes like this on campus.

Policies, goals outlined 
in candidate capsules 



By Chad Resting 
Managing Editor 
This year, five Democrats and 
two Republicans will challenge 
President Bush in the election. 
Here is a breakdown of their 
proposals, and Ihe issues sut- 
rounding their candidacies. 

Jerry Brown (D) - Former 
two-term governor of Califomia. 
Brown has focused most of his 
rhetoric on the electoral process, 
saying that presidential candida- 
cies are fueled by and answer- 
able 10 Political Action Commit- 
tees' money alone. Brown has 



pledged lo accept no campaign 
conuibution larger than SIOO. 
As governor of California during 
the 70s, Brown was a champion 
of affirmative -action policies. 
Nearly one-half of his appoint- 
ments to slate positions were 
minorities. Under bis tutelage as 
governor, Califomia stringently 
enforced clean-air laws and 
curbed loxic wastes. 

Patrick Buchannan (R) - 
Specchwriier for President 
Richard Nixon and the conserva- 
tive co-host of die Cable News 
Network's "Crossfire" news 



show. Buchannan has been 
sharply critical of the Bush 
Administration's economic poli- 
cies. He claims the U.S. is suf- 
fering economic hardships by 
not insisting on free markets for 
U.S. goods around the world, 
and by spending loo much on 
foreign aid. Buchannan also 
opposed die Gulf War. citing the 
cost involved. In recent weeks. 
Buchannan has been attacked as 
anti-Semitic for saying the 
"Israeli lobby" had acted as an 
"amen comer" for the US Gulf 
See Candidate Capsules page 3 



tcm, â–  Snyder said. "It didn't 
work. Now I'm convinced that 
the system doesn't work," 

"I resigned because I felt like a 
hypocrite. I was always attack- 
ing student government while I 
was still pan of it. It wasn't right 
for me to be condemning an 
organization I was part of." 
added Snyder. 

Green said that she resigned 
because she didn't want to be 
associated with an "unethical" 
group. "There's no way to play 



by the rules with people who 
have no rules," Green said of 
IPSGA. 

Green was also disappointed 
in the lack of support she 
received from university offi- 
cials. "I got no backing from 
the university for the protection 
of my civil liberties, they said 
they thought the whole thing 
was terrible but they wouldn't 
do anything," Green said. "It 
was just a lot of lip service."

Psychic foresees 
bright future 
for IPFW 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

When Ian Bliss looks into 
IPFW's future, he smiles. 

Bliss, a nationally renowned 
psychic Ls in town to promote a 
physic fair he's hosting this 
weekend at Ihe Days Inn on 
Lima Road. 

The San Antonio-based clar- 
ivoyant claims to be 90% accu- 
rate with his soothsaying. BlLss 
predicted the Gulf War a year 
before il came about. He fore- 
saw die current economic slump 
and even picked Washington 
and Buffalo for Ihe Superbowl 
this year. Bliss can ramble on 
with a long list of dead-on pre- 
dictions he made in the past. 

Bui lei's look into die future. 
What does Bliss see in the com- 
ing year for IPFW? "There are 
going 10 be a lot of Indian arti- 
facts found underground here," 
he said. Bliss said die artifacts 
will be from a very early origin. 

Bliss sees successful seasons 
ahead for Mastodon sports 
teams. He said the men's team 
will finish strongly this year but 
next season will be even bellcr. 
He predicted that the women's 
leam will do well this season but 
may taper off loward Ihe end of 
their schedule, He noted that he 
feels "really good" about the 
men's volleyball team's chances 
at taking an NCAA title, 

"I do .see a good future for 
sports here." Bliss said. 

From the student body. Bliss 
sees two individuals who will 
become famous. One student, 
he .said, will Ix; president of Ihe 
United States in the year 2017. 

Fod Wayne can also expect a 
rosy future according to Bliss. 
He said the city will not have 
any flooding problems, it will 
get its minor league baseball 
team and the Fury and Komets 
will go on to banner years. 

On the national front. Bliss has 



predicted George Bush whipping 
Bill Clinton in the upcoming 
presidential election. He also 
sees an end to our nation's eco- 
nomic woes. 

Bliss said to watch for Cuban 
dictator Fidel Castro in future 
world headlines. The psychic 
said Castro may attempt to take 
over the Panama Canal. "He 
will go out in a blaze of glory," 
Bliss Siud. 

Bliss also said that Mikhail 
Gorbachev will emerge again as 
a world figure. Bliss .said that 
Gorbachev will someday speak 
at our campus. 

In the world of pro sports, 
Bliss predicted that the San 
Antonio Spurs would win the 
NBA championship. He also 
said that the Cleveland Indians 
would win iheir division next 
summer. 

Bliss says he's a psychic like 
no other. "There's not a psy- 
chic around as accurate as 1 
am. And there's not a psychic 
around with the balls to predict 
the things I do." 

Bliss calls himself the psy- 
chic with a conscience. He 
says he never uses his powers 
for gambling or to exploit oth- 
ers. He even refused an offer 
from the National Enquirer to 
serve on die tabloid's panel of 
psychic experts. 

"If I wanted to make big 
bucks I could book private 
clients and tell diem to pay me 
S5,000 and I'd make things 
right for them, " Bliss said. 
"I'm just not into that." 

Bliss graduated from 
Columbia University with a 
degree in business. Along with 
his psychic activities, he is a 
guitar playing hard-rock musi- 
cian. Bliss also hosts two talk 
radio shows in Texas when 
he's not on the road.

Volleydons set to start promising season Saturday 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

If the IPFW men's volleyball 
leam surpasses last season's per- 
formance, they may be called the 
number one leam in die country. 

The IPFW men's volleyball 
leam finished last season wilh a 
record of 19-9 and netted a third 
place finish in the NCAA Final 
Four Toumamcni. The Volley- 
dons defeated Penn State, fin- 
ished behind winner Long Beach 
Stale and ninncr-up USC in the 
toumamenl held in Hawaii. 

Undefeated in the MIVA con- 
ference with a 6-0 record, IPFW 
is again picked lo finish first by 
volleyball Mondily. Ohio Slate 
and Ball Sate arc expected to fin- 
ish second and third, respective- 
ly in the MIVA, 

Arnie Ball, coach of Ihe Vol- 
leydons, believes Ohio Stale will 
offer stiff competition for the 
conference championship 
because of die strcngUi of dicir 
reluming players. 

Lost to graduation this season 



was opposite hitter Fred Mal- 
colm. Second Team Ail-Ameri- 
can and Most Valuable Player on 
the All-MIVA team. Ball 
believes even wilh the loss of 
Malcolm, IPFW will be a heller 
offensive team. 

"We tiave more people to carry 
the offensive load. The offease 
will be more diversified." 

Reluming All-MIVA player, 
Raul Pappalco at swing hitter, is 
even a stronger player, according 
to Ball, and will be relied on to 
diversify the offense. 

Lloy Ball, a sophomore setter, 
will also return. LasI season 
Lloy Ball was named Fresh- 
man Player of the Year by Vol- 
leyball Monthly and a memtxr 
of die All-MIVA team. Lloy 
Dull will be the pivotal player 
in die offense. 

"It is necessary that he leads 
us," according to Coach Ball. 
"Lloy Is a year older," which 
Coach Ball believes will also 
diversify the offense with his 
improved placement of sets 



and court awareness. 

Swing hitters, Norman 
Almodovar and Chad Blaichley 
are also expected lo contribute 
to the offense. 

However, the play of the 
backcourt defense is a concern 
for Coach Ball. "We are 
spending a lot of lime on the 
backcourt defense; it is a weak 
spot." The front line defense 
will be "very comparable in 
the height division." which 
coach Ball believes should 
assist Ihe play of die backcourt. 

The Volleydons set die season 
in motion Jan. 18 nt the ASICS 
Qualifier at Ball Stale, The win- 
ner of Ihe Ball Statc-IPFW 
matchup earns a trip lo San 
Diego, Calif.. Feb 14 and 15. lo

Editorial 



Voters say "Enough" 



Why edilorialize about the election in Janijaiy? 
The New Hampshire primary is a month away. 
The presidential camp^gns are at a low boil. 

The questions at hand is why only half of eligi- 
ble Amcri^ins go to the polls. It is an issue better 
dealt with in January than on Nov. 3. 

Consider the 1988 presidential election. 
According to a 1988 New York Tmies/CBS poll, 
two-thirds of the eligible voters questioned want- 
ed choices other than George Bush and Michael 
Dukakis. 

One-half of the polled voters thought that the 
campaign was more "negative" than campaigns 
of the recent pasL Over one-half also described 
the 1988 election as "dull." "Dull," even diough 
neither was an incumbent, and Bush didn't hold a 
clear lead until the last weeks of the campaign. 

If presidential politics is termed dull, what word 
would voters use to describe school board elec- 
tions? 

The registration process is a serious obstacle for 
American voters. In three separate studies, the 
level of voter registration accounted for 80% of 
the variance in the percentage of die population 
that actually voted, more than all other factors 
combined. Where voter registration is conve- 
nient, a.s il is in Minnesota, the percentile of vot- 
ers is sharply higher. 

Measures have been proposed and used to make 
voting easier, like "motor-voter" registration and 
Election Day registration at the polls. If these 
ideas get voters to the polls, the entire nation 
should adopt them. 

It'.s no secret, though, that Americans' faith in 
their government tiÂ»k a sharp decline after Viet- 
nam and Watergate TTie public takes bureaucrat- 
ic duplicity as busines.s as usual, not as a reason 
for outrage. 



Modem politics sells a candidate by using that 
cynicism. The candidate, even if he or she is an 
incumbent, strives to label him or her self as an 
"outsider" to the political process, taking bacon 
from the fat cats in Washington and bringing it 
back to the home district. 

The opposing candidate gets called a "liheral" 
or an "old-boy network" Republican, whatever 
marks him as a political game-player. 

The opinions of most Americans buck those 
labels. Smdies have shown their views cut across 
traditional "liberal" and "conservative" lines. 
Labelling merely cuts voters into demographics, 
the easier targeL 

While our breach of faith in the government is 
played upon, no solutions arc offered, jusi ene- 
mies. 

If Americans agreed that both Bush and 
Dukakis are "dull," some sort of coalition-build- 
ing government ought to be possible. If Ameri- 
cans are tired of "either/or" politics, "both/and" 
ought lobe tried, 

There is another action a disgusted citizen may 
lake, and that's inaction. For many, non-voting is 
a slap at the American government. The Ameri- 
can two-party system is loo narrow a choice for 
them. 

Non-voting is a good protest, but it bears a 
responsibility, loo. A non-voie by itself is a 
silent gesture, with only personal needs served. 

Refusal to vole should be accompanied by let- 
ters to editors, stalehouse protest, and petilfon 
signings. Non-voters have to tell everyone they 
are sick and tired of empty choices. 

Money, jobs, and lives all flow through the 
bands of elected officials. It's too important to 
just ignore. 




Shopping horrors 

Over the brink at Xmas 



By Chad Hesling 
Managing Editor 

Christmas is over, thank God, Anyone who 
came within a mile of The Mall in December has 
to be relieved. 

During the holiday season, everything gets 
pushed 10 the limit. Your patience and your 
MasterCard can't take anymore by Christmas 
Eve. Everyone talks about stocking stuffers and 
Christmas candy and egg nog, but what people 
really want for Christmas is some sleep. 

Not everyone makes it through, (bough. 
Some were pushed over the brink by the holiday 
madness. Here are a few of the uglier lakes. 

The Hazardous Materials division of the 
FWFD was called to The Mall's largest depan- 
mcnt 10 investigate a noxious cloud hanging over 
the perfume counters. 

According to the store manager, who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity, the emergency 
began when shoppers began to complain of 
dizziness and nausea from the fumes, 

"The counter ladies had been spraying per- 
fume on shoppers' wrists all day," the m.-uiager 
explained, "there were pools of Passion and 
Obsession all over the floor, and that weird yel- 
low cloud was making everyone nervous. When 
people started lo get ill, we called the experts." 

When Fon Wayne police officers anested an 
alleged pickpocket at Tlie Mall in early Decem- 
ber, they were shocked lo fmd dial die 14-year- 
old boy had lived in The Mall for five years. 

In an interview with "fhc Communicaior, the 
boy said he was dropped off by his mother at the 
food coun entrance in 1986, and ha.sn'i left since. 
"1 lake wallets for money, but otherwise The 
Mall fills all my needs." the boy said. "1 watch 
department store TV's when I'm bored. During 
closed hours, I jusi get in with the maJl-walkcrs. 
It's a good life here." 

A clerk at die Bobks "R" Us store ai The Mall 
was fued after a Dec. IS incident in which she 
attempted lo strangle a customer. Assault 
charges are pending against the clerk. 

The fight broke out when the customer 
approached the counter with a copy of both 
"Gone With the Wind" and "Scarlett." and a.skcd 



which book was written fu^t. 

The clerk, reportedly a literature major at a 
local college, dien crawled over the counter and 
clutched the customer's neck, according to wit- 
nesses. The two had to be separated by Mall 
security. 

Local mental-health professionals noted a 
marked rise in the number of cases of "Yuleo- 
phobia" this year. 

Yulophobia sufferers complain of holiday- 
related paranoid delusions every winter. Doctor 
Sieg Fried Schneider of ihe Indiana State Mental 
Health Commission reports what this season's 
complaints have been especially pronounced. 

"Ve had von man complain zal Zanta vos 
chasinck him in his dreams, vil a candy cane 
shaped like a siilelio," Dr. Schneider said, "isn't 
zat crazy? Also ve had lo tok down a voman 
who had a shotgun. She said she hat lo prolcck 
her home from dcr MasterCard collectors." 

A mob of angry Mall customers dismembered 
and killed a man near die two-mile marker in the 
northeast sector of the Mall parking lot on Dec. 
20. 

According to wiines.ses, the man parked his 
'92 Camaro diagonally, taking up three whole 
parking spaces. As he was wedging his vehicle 
into the slots, some 20 cruising drivers goi out of 
their cars and began lo pound his car. 

The man reportedly opened his door and 
retoned that "one of you morons might ding my 
painijob" The crowd then yanked the man from 
his car and began to beat him with tire irons and 
snow chains The Camaro was set on fire, as 
onlookers chanted "Hey. hey. whai do you say, 
we need parking spoLs today." 

A Mall security spokesman said, "By the lime 
our officers gol out there, all thai was left was 
some bloody mush and a finger or two. No sus- 
pects. All we could do was put the fire out. 
Somebody look the parking spaces, though," he 
said. 

Employees at die Becfstick Farms store were 
spoiled pulling up Christmas decorations on Jan. 
8, one week after they had taken them down, 

"Christmas is our high-dollar season here," 
said an employee, "so we got an early suirt," 



Senator resigns 

Snyder chastises senate, student body 



To The Editor: 

On December 19, 1991 lliis 
senator submitted his letter of 
resignation to the Indiana-Pur- 
due Student Government 
Association. 

To my friends and former 
constituents I apologize for, 
what may appear lo be, quit- 
ting the good fighl. The deci- 
sion to resign was one of the 
most difficult decisions I have 
ever had to make, as il repre- 
sents one of the very few 
limes I have ever left a job 
undone. It was. however, no 
longer possible for me lo con- 
jifiue to associaie myself with 
stich an unconscionable orga- 
nization as student govern- 
ment. 

Your student government has 
become. I believe, corrupted 
by bigotry, prejudice, and 
racism. It is an organization 
in which "to uphold student 
rights" as its conslilution and 
seal proclaim, seemingly takes 
a backseat lo self-prescrvalion 
and sclf-aggrandizemenl. 

What began as a basic issue 
of safeguarding student con- 
stitutional rights and civil lib- 
erties was perverted by some 
in student government into 
political posturing. The mem- 
bers of the judicial branch of 
student government seemed lo 
suffer a moral, if not physical, 
paralysis born out of a fear 
that they might be ihc next 
viclims of a hate campaign. 

As a result, they have 



refused to answer, or act upon, 
the many appeals, I, and oth- 
ers, placed before Uiem. Dur- 
ing the 45 days that they dal- 
lied, 1 and my family suffered. 
I ailcmpled lo resolve these 
issues by asking our university 
to uphold student's constitu- 
tional guarantees and rights as 
it has pledged to do in its 
Code of Student Rights. 
Responsibilities, and Conduct. 
By so doing, I was asking this 
university lo affirm the U.S. 
Supreme Court's decision in 
Tinker vs. Des Moines School 
District in which Justice Fort- 
as, writing for the^majprity, 
slated: " ] 

"Students in scKooT as 
well as out of school arc 
'persons' under our Con- 
stitution. They are pos- 
sessed of fundamental 
rights which the state 
must respect... It can 
hardly be argued that 
either students or teach- 
ers shed their constitu- 
tional rights, ..at the 
school house gale." 
Unfortunately, it would now 
seem that the concept 
expressed in Tinker and those 
rights fought so hard for no 
longer exist at this university 
as my appeals were either 
denied or dismissed as insub- 
stantial or irrelevant. As a 
result I withdrew all further or 
pending appeals. 

While I attempted to "work 
within the system," the "sys- 



tem" - in this case a slate uni- 
versity - once again proved 
itself to be comprised of ccn^ 
sors for the common good; 
purveyors of parochialism; 
and prostitutes to its profes- 
sion and prodigy. I am not 
suggesting that all administra- 
tors or faculty members at this 
university are deserving of 
this condemnation. Unfortu- 
nately, however, the excep- 
tions arc .few and their voice 
can seldom be heard over Uie 
ravings of the many. 

Because I believe in the pri- 
macy of my (and all student's) 
civil liberties over any concept 
of school tradition or alle- 
giance, 1 say Uie following lo 
my University: You have, 
through your actions and the 
explicit or implicit support of 
a university-sponsored and 
salaried student government, 
which has proven itself to 
more closely embrace Ihe ten- 
ants of fascism rather than 
democracy, demonslralcd your 
inability or unwillingness to 
uphold or protect my constitu- 
tional guarantees, civil righLs, 
or civil liberties. You have 
idly sat by while these rights 
and liberties have been ground 
under the heel of jackboots by 
demagogues, ideologies, and 
like-minded individuals who 
would represent themselves to 
be (his university's student 
leaders. 

Leaders such as these will 
indeed emerge from the ranks 



of this university's graduates. 
Among (hem will be lawyers, 
judges, educators, anij legisla- 
tors of the future. And (he 
mind-se( with which they 
leave this campus in these 
years is that some civil rights 
and liberties are OK provided 
the motivations are OK. This 
will be the legacy of IPFW. 

I believe the university has a 
fundamental mission which is 
to search for the truth. And a 
university is a place where 
people have to have the right 
to speak the unspeakable and 
challenge the unchallengeable. 

This mission is being per- 
verted, if not abrogated, at 
IPFW. 

I began this letter by apolo- 
gizing for quilling. Know 
this, however, while I am 
ceasing my efforts lo fight 
within the system for what I 
believe in, I will never quit Ihe 
fight. I will now take my 
issues to itie student body and 
the community as a whole. 

Finally, lo all who read this. 
know that I am guilty. I did 
speak the unspeakable and 
challenge the unchallengeable 
but know too that, to para- 
phrase from a, now infamous, 
student manifesto of some 
twenty-five years ago, The 
Port Huron Statement: 

"If I tried to do the impossi- 
ble as some have said. I did so 
to avoid die unimaginable."

PTC resumes Kettler stops at IPFW 



To the Editor: 

The Public Transportation 
Corporation of Fort Wayne 
halted service lo Kettler Hall 
last year because construction 
projects and roadway changes 
made it difficult for the buses 
to negotiate all the turns 
between Walb and Kettler. 
Since then the university has 
widened the most problematic 



intersection, and on January 6 
PTC resumed service to Ket- 
tler Hall. 

Many students and employ- 
ees have told me how much 
they appreciate being able to 
catch Ihe bus at Kettler Hall 
once again. The thanks 
should go lo Mr. Tom Pfeffer- 
kom. PTC Direclor of Opera- 
tions. Mr. Robert Morton, 



PTC Manager, and the PTC 
drivers for dieir willingness to 
put Kettler Hall back on the 
Village Woods- IPFW-C an ler- 
bury route bus #3. I also want 
to thank Mr. Al Peters, repre- 
senting the Clerical and Ser- 
vice Advisory Council, for 
working with me to inform 
PTC of IPFW's public trans- 
portation needs.

Governor William Clinton (D) - 
Two term governor of Arkansas. 
Acknowledged as having a small 
edge on the other four Democrat- 
ic contenders after winning an 
informal straw poll of Florida 
delegates. Clinton states that he 
wants to put "government back 
on the side of the forgotten mid- 
dle class," espousing a tax cut for 
the middle-class. Clinton wants 
federal welfare to be extended to 
healthy recipients for a limit of 
two years, in exchange for cours- 
es in parenting and job skills, 
Clinton has also proposed a 
National Service Corps, in which 
two or three years of public ser- 
vice may be served in return for 
low-interest loans. 

David Duke (R) - Louisiana 
state representative. Received 
nationwide publicity in his failed 
campaign for governor of 
Louisiana, Seen as a stalking 
horse for racial poHtics. Duke has 
positioned himself against "crime 
in the streets, welfare illegitima- 
cy, and affirmative action." Cast- 
ing a vote for Duke may prove to 
be difficult, as several states' 
Republican party conventions 
(including Michigan's) have vot- 
ed to keep Duke off the ballot. 

Senator Thomas Harkin (D) - 
Senator from Iowa. Objects to a 
middle-class tax cut, claiming the 
one Clinton and Senator Robert 
Kerrey support would save "only

Senator Robert Kerrey (D) - 
TXvo-term governor of Nebraska, 
then elected to the Senate in 
1988. Kerrey proposes a national 
health-care program called the 
"Health USA" designed to con- 
trol health costs. He also plans to 
direct communications infrastruc- 
ture." Kerrey is critical of the 
Gulf War, citing a lack of clear 
purpose in the war effort. He has 
claimed that the Bush administra- 
tion hasn't done enough to foster 
democracy in the new Eurasian 
republics. 

Paul Tsongas (D) - Former Mas- 
sachusetts Senator. A centrist 
politician, working to establish 
himself as the "pre-business 
Democrat," Tsongas espouses 
budget trimming to bring the 
deficit under control, while set- 
ting up federal small-business 
incentives and redirecting Ihe 
American economy to a techno- 
logical focus. He has denounced 
middle-class tax cuts proposed by 
two of his Democratic opponents. 



Senate- 



continued from page 1 
Snyder and Green have both 
dropped their parts of a suit Hied 
with IPFW's appeals board against 
IPSGA and the internal affairs 
committee. 

John Wiesenburger. vice presi- 
dent of legislature, had nothing 
nice to say about the departing 
senators. "Snyder has done so 
much harm to the credibility of 
senate that it's going to lake a 
while to work through it," he said. 
"But there's only one way to go 
from here - up " 

Wiesenburger noted that senate 
has already begun to run more 



smoothly sans Snyder. "Since 
Mark left, the meetings have been 
lasting about a half an hour less. 
And if you look at the minutes, the 
time is no longer dominated by 
one person. The meetings are 
much more civil now," Wiesen- 
burger said. 

Even though Snyder has dropped 
out of the system, he says he 
won't be silent. Snyder is current- 
ly working on bringing a student 
branch of the American Civil Lib- 
erties Union lo IPFW's campus 
and he says he plans to continue 
scorching the pages of this paper 
with his letters lo the editor.

Campus expansion 

New Fine Arts building creative, efficient 



Bj Sarah Jakacky 
Features Editor 

The new Fine Arts building, which 
opened lasl fall, helps the department 
run more efficiently and allows more 
creative freedom for siudenls, said 
Leslie Motz, associate professor of 
fine arts and acting department chair- 
man. 

According to Molz, the structure is 
nol simply a new building but a 
replacement of the old, inadequate 
buildings that were located in down- 
town Port Wayne on West Berry 
Street. 

Molz says that a new facility was 
desperately needed to replace the other 
buildings. 

There was no money for repairs so 
the buildings were in a state of serious 
disrepair. The old buildings were built 
jusi before the turn of the century. 
Despite problems, Moiz said they 
served the school well for the past 69 
years. 

In 1976. according to Moii, the Fort 
Wayne School of Fine Arls merged 
with IPfW 10 become the department 
of fine arts. He expl^ns that the union 



OCKARt&amp;TA 



increased enrollmeni, which created an 
even greater need for a new faciLly. 

Although there were many positive 
aspects of the old buildings, Molz said 
that it was nol designed for leaching. 
"The space was very cut up and not 
very efficient,- he says. 

Professor of fine arts. Russell Oeiiel. 
said thai the buildings were originally 
houses, bul were transformed into the 
art school in 1922. 

Mou feels thai the new facility has a 
more professional atmosphere and 
offers much to the campus. 

"Wc are clo.ser lo the academics and 
are finally a pan of the campus. We've 
developed a philosophical attitude 
toward work and have encouraged slu- 
denLs lo think creatively. We have a 
humanistic view of things, which 1 
think oihcr departmcnls may be envi- 
ous of." said Motz. 

Anoihcr benefit of the new building, 
according lo Motz, is thai, even though 
the replacement structure isn't much 
larger than the previous facility, the 
department is now beller equipped lo 
handle increases in enrollment. 



Currently, Motz said, there are 250 
fine art majors, and he predicts this 
figure will grow. 

Accompanying the many benefits of 
the new building were a few problems. 
Molz confessed. 

"The roof leaked, the ventilation sys- 
tems were improperly adjusted and 
were programmed wrong, and there 
were various leaky water pipes that 
were not tightened enough," Motz 
said, "It's a wonder it came off as well 
as it did," he said, because it was the 
first time the technicians worked 
together on a project 

Octtcl also had some complaints, 
saying, "The new building is serving 
its purpose quite well. Bul due to 
financial restrictions there isn't the 
storage that I would have liked lo have 
seen. I would have like lo have seen 
larger sludios, too," he said. 

Motz said that if Ihey had "gone to 
legislation for the funding for a new 
facility, we probably wouldn't have 
gotten it." 

The primary funding for the project, 
Molz said, came from legislation. 



Other sources of income came from 
bonds that were sold lo finance the 
new building. Eventually Jie said, the 
bonds will be payed back. 

"The whole concept is actually very 
confusing," Molz said. 

The Fine Arts Building is virtually 
compleled, but is awaiung the addition 
of an art gallery lo display the studenLs' 
work. The arl gallery, according to 
Molz, will connect the Fine Aris 
Building and the new theater, which is 
currently under construction 

The theater, located to the northeast 
of the Fine Arts Building, will be com- 
pleled early next fall. Motz said thai 
classes will probably not take place 
there until ihe spring semester. 

Motz said that, although he is very 
happy wilh the new art building, 
"some people liked the personality of 
the old building. This is a colder 
atmosphere," he said. "This is much 
more business-like. " 

He added that, no matter what, ihc 
new building offers more of a chance 
to think creatively and a more efficient 
work atmasphcre.

Turnovers stuff Mastodons 



By Mark Donald&lt;&lt;on 
Staff Writer 

Don'l offer Andy Piazza an apple 

turnover for desscn. he may explode. 
The IPFW men's baskeiball coach 

watched his team turn the ball over 17 
Unies in (he firsi half in a Great Lakes 
Valley Conference conlcsi at Kentucky 
Wcsleyan University on Thursday, 
Jan. 9. The Mastodons were not able 
10 climb oul of the hole they dug for ' 
themselves and fell lo the Panihcrs 80- 
65. IPFW has not bcaicn Wesleyan in 

16a(lcmpis. 

On Saturday the 'Dons salvaged a 
split for the road trip when they beat 
University of Southern Indiana 94-80. 
IPFW with.slood the ScfKiming Bagles' 
second half charge behind 22 points 
from senior Eric Vaughn. Vaughn hit 
five of five ihree-poinler;, in the half 
and seven of eight for die game. He 
finished with 34 points, including 11 
of 13 from the floor and five of six 
from the frec-lhrow tine. 

Against Wesleyan. senior Clarence 
Rich hit dirce of four ihrcc-poini shots 
and two other field goals in the first 10 
minuies to help the 'Dons lo a 20-16 
lead with 9:38 remaining in the half. 

From thai point die PanUiers went on 
a 21-3 tear capped by junior Mike 
Gray's short Jumper which made it 37- 
23 at die 2:39 mark. 

IPFW was down 10 at the half when 
junior Doug Reincke's tip-in made it 
40-30. 

Piazza felt fortunate to be only 10 
points behind. 

"We had a miserable first half," he 
said. "But we turned the ball over 17 
limes, and when you compound thai 
with dieit 14 free throws, we're still 
down only 10." 

The Panthers went to die free-throw 
line 37 times in the game, hilling 31, 
while the 'Dons hil 11 of 13 charity 
tosses. 

Wesleyan opened the second half by 
hitting five of six free throws lo go up 
45-30 with three minutes gone. 

Junior Scan Gibson started IPFW on 
the way back, gelling fouled as he 
scored inside and converting die bonus 
lo make il 45-33. 

Aficr senior Kenneth Martin hil a ' 
short jumper for ihe Panthers, the 
Masiodons began methodically work- 
ing the ball inside while holding Wes- 
leyan scoreless. 



Rcincke powered in three straight 
baskets then dished lo Gibson for 
anodicr as the Ttons cut die lead lo six. 
47-41, at Ihe 14;19maik. 

That was as close as the T)ons would 
gel. After a Panther limeoul junior 
Sieve Divine broke the IPFW press 
and hit a threc-poinicr lo stop the run. 

Wesleyan look advantage of Uic free- 
throw line 10 oulscore IPFW 30-24 the 
rest of the way. 

Reincke hil eight of 10 field goal 
aiiempts to lead the 'Dons with 17 
points, all but Uiree in the second half. 

Rich didn't score after his opening 
outburst and finished wiUi 13 points, 
five rebounds and three assists. 

Gibson had nine points and 11 
rebounds and junior Pal Murphy had 

10 points. 

In Saturday's contest on the USI cam- 
pus in Fvansvillc. IPFW fashioned an 

1 1 point lead, 27-16. wilh 9:53 remain- 
ing in Ihe first half as Vaughn sand- 
wiched a pair of three-pointers ;iround 
junior John Hohnstre iter's pul-back of 
his own miss. 

The Saeaming Eagles cut the lead lo 
six, 45-39, with just over a minute left 
in die half by scoring six points in 40 
seconds before Vaughn converted a 
steal to send ihe 'Dons into die locker 
room up 47-39. 

IPFW stretched the lead as junior Pal 
Murphy scored twice in Ihe first 
minute of the second half 

Over the next five minutes. USI 
outscorcd the 'Dons 15-8 to cut the 
lead to 55-54 at the 14:40 mark. Dur- 
ing the run nine of the Screaming 
Eagles' points were scored by junior 
Chris Bowles, Bowles, a 6-fool-lO- 
inch center, sal oul most of the first 
half with foul trouble. lie scored 24 of 
his 27 poinis in Ihe second half. 

Il was at that point thai Vaughn look 
die game into his own hands hitting 
three ihree-pointers in a row in just 
over a minute, EachofhisshoLs was a 
step farther away from the previous 

"I have a thing going with our assis- 
Lint coach (Die Doumanian)," laughed 
Vaughn after the game. "I tell him 
wherever 1 shoot froip, ihai's my 
range," '"" 'â€¢' ' " ' 

"Really, though, that's the most

Ball set for life 



The ifu^flcrback takes ihc snap and 
pilches ihe fooiball to the running 
back who gains six yards. The point 
guard lakes Ihe inbound pass and 
dribbles Ihc basketball across the Icn- 
sccond line, delivers a Ntunce pass lo 
the forward who makes a iwelvc-fooi 
jump shol. The seller receives itie 
bump pass and sets a pass lo ihc hii- 
ler who spikes Ihc ball and scores a 
point. 

The quarterback, potnl guard, and 
Ihc seller all arc leadership pasitions 
in Iheir respective sports o( Tootball, 
basketball, and volleyball. The 
IPFW men's volleyball team is lead 
by its setter Lloy Ball, 



IPFW Sports 
Spotlight 




Only a sophomore. Ball will be 
relied on lo be the team leader, lo 
direcl the offense, and give support, 
along with crilicism, to other team 
members. This is a role Ball accord- 
ing to Arnie Ball, Volley Dons' 
coach, feels comfortable wilh. 

At 6-fcei-9-inches, B-ill's height, 
along with his extensive playing 
experiences, has mode in on one of 
ibe best selteni in the country. Vol- 
leyball Monihly recognized his talent 
by naming him Freshman Player of 
Ihe Year last year. Ball also made 
Ihc All-MIVA team. 

As a senior basketball standout at 
Woodlan High School in Woodbum, 
Intl. Ball was recognized for his 
leadership abilities on ihe playing 
coun. many limes playing the posi- 
tion of point guard, Indiana Univer- 
sity Coach, Bob Knight, sensing Bal- 



l's leadership, offered him, a scholar- 
ship tor basketball. Declining 
Knight's offer. Ball chose to play 
volleyball for his father at IPnV, 

With his mind nrmly set on volley- 
ball. Ball participated ai levels that 
defined his ability and sharpened his 
leadership skills. In the summer of 
1990, Ball played on Ihc National B 
Team, from which players for Ihe 
Olympic leam are sclecied. Ball Ihen 
competed in the World University 
Games in England During the 1991 
summer. 

With three years of eligibility lefl 
for NCAA volleyball, it seems proba- 
ble that Ball will lead IPFW to a 
NCAA tide. 

Personal goals of competing in the 1992 
or 1996 Olympic Games, and ihu profes- 
sional volleyball in Europe are never put 
of reach for Uie 6-fool-9-inch Ball.
