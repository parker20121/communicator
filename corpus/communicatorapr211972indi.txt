"A History of Yoo Poo V." 



By Scoll Gillie 



miJwesiern ciiy there was bom a 
new university. Yoo Poo U. With a 
modenile facully and o modcBt stu- 
dent body, the fledging academy act 
upon lis mission of bringing enlight- 
enment to the barbarians. 

IV task waa not cosy. Barhar- 
inm cannot be conquered overnight. 
Tlio elders of the academy wore 
wise in perceiving ihia. With al- 
mighty conviction and a moderate 
commitment of funds, the elders of 
the academy I'ccogni/ed the neces- 
sity of importing inyolics from the 
lands of Ihc PJges. 

America in the mid-twentieth cen- 
tury was roughly analogous to o 
human brain. Most of the provoca- 
tive thinking in the society occurr- 
ed along the edges, the Eastern and 
ivcatem coasts. The interior ful- 
filled the analogy as it was seen 
to contain mostly fatty mutter. 

Yoo Poo U. found, unforlunnteiy, 
that mystics from the Edges 
brought high prices at auction! 
some mystics brought as much as 
JlOO per pound per year. Thus, 
out of necessity, Y.P.U. supple- 
mented its focully with mystics 
from Minnesota and Texas and 
with junior mystics, 

Since Yoo Poo hud grown into 

effort of two existing universi- 
ties, Yoo and Poo, the commun- 
ity in which Yoo Poo (I. was 
established was extremely pleased 
thul two great traditions would 
bring cnlighlcnmcnl lo ihc land. 



Alas, Yoo Poo U. and its fac- 
ulty found the intellectual cli- 
mate of the land to be quite back- 
waril. Among the inner circles 
of the mystics, frequent jokes 
were to be made regarding the 

ity. And in the community, one 
heard carping criticism from citi- 
zens resenting the iairusion of the 

All coald have been saved hod 
Yoo Poo and the community work- 
ed cooperatively in solving some 
of the serious problems associat- 
ed wilb barbarism. 

Hut the mystics, being imported 
from the Edges and olher far- 
away places found little allegi- 
ance to anylfiing except places 
like Burr Clce and Hah Vahd. Al- 
legiance to Yoo Poo U. and. 
particularly, allegiance to ihe 
community simply did not exist. 

Graduslly, the mystics built 

great walla around Yoo Poo to keep 

out barbarians, Expensive fees.

demit standards of excellence 
guarded Yoo Poo from any incur- 
sion by barbarians. 

One day, a crushing blow was 
dealt Yoo Poo. Citizens from the 
communily infiltrated tbc Stale 
Legislature. Even the moderute 
flow of funds to Yoo Poo was cut 
to u trickle. The mystics from the 
Edges returned to the Edges. 

Those mystics who chose to slay 
became barbariuns.

LETTERS TO THE EDITORS 



Anoaymity forever 

Oeor \ngrv and Pissed Students 
with No Name. 

U»t week's COMMUNICATOR 
carried a leller by you which mild- 
ly complained about the Siudcnt 
Union Board's selection of the 
Association as the main group for 
Harborarbor Days. 

Your main point seemed to be 
that ihe "Association" is only 
cherished by the "crutch and cane" 
cinwd. While we can't disagree 
that ihe Association has had big 
hits in ibe past,. they arc for from 
dead. In fact, they've just hod a 
new single come out in the last 
week. 

A Student Union Board poll did 
show ihol the Association were 

25% of those voting used canes. 
The SUD has been begging "piss- 
ed" students to gel involved all 
year. They wanted Johnny Cash 
and ihc Brothers Four. 

Selecting a major group with 
the limited capital available is 
difficult. S25,000 groups require 
outside backing, not just student 
backing. And the Association sure 
beats the Prijid Pink (the major 
group, costing ihe same price, two 
years agtj). 

We hope that the widespread dis- 
satisfaction continues to be shown 
through long lines of "pissed" 
eludcnls picking up lickels. Uul 
please don't dig out your old 
dresses.

Much more community hosti- 
lity was experienced during the 
"Saperstar" episode. Lawsuits 
were even ihrealcned at ihe

actions in the community. Nor 
was Mr. Gillie upset at the "slu-

in the 16,000 spent on the 
"Superstar" program. 

I cannot help but conclude thai 
Mr. Gillie is motivated less by 
an altruistic concern for ihe Slu-

personal tastes. It seems spend-

Prt;Bidenlial candidate Abli^ 
feels that the purpose of ihc Slu-

the most imporiunl issue in the

best interests of the student

signed to fairly 'serve the stu-

it seems thnt minority groups lake

ABC plolfomi tvhich rends "our

students, they must be involved,

role in any campus activity, and 
that is l« develop programs in

AAA Party Statement 



AAA. \belurd's \ciiv 
ntes, is a new parly on campus 
this Spring. The name stems 
fmm the theologian and educator, 
Peter Abelatd. Abelard stood for 
Quality Education, as does A\A. 

One of the requirements on this 
campus, in the area of Arts, is 
outdated. AAA is recommending 
t at the present language require- 
ment be nbolished and that the 
first yeur of language taken should 

Steps are being taken at both Indi- 
ana and Punjde main campuses lo 
make this change also. 

One of the most talked about 
issues this Spring is the concept 
of a Single Administration and the 
possibility of an autonomous cnm- 
puB. AAA advocates n single 
administration on this campus to 
rid the students of constant prob- 
lems. The idea of Indiana-Purdue 
at Fort Wayne being un autonomous 
campus is worthy of careful con- 
sideration. AAA would like the 
students to have n voice ia this 
area. Perhaps n petition should 

the Administration of the student's 

The Pass/Fail Option should 
have equal weight at both Univer- 
sities. Presently, Indiana honors 
A-D as passing, but Purdue only 
honors A-C as n passing grade. 
AAA goes a step further in suggest- 
ing that the Pass/Fail Option be 



other than just clectivos. 

As many students ore evening 
sludenLi seeking a degree program, 
AAA, with its goal as qunlity edu- 
cation, is stressing the idea of 
more high level evening courses. 
This will aid all students and 
will help the night student lo 
complete his degree in less time. 
During the last vent, there has 
been much discussion about a 
Day Core Center, AAA bucks 
the proposal of a Day Carr; Cen- 
ter to assist students with young 
children, but again AAA takes 
another step. The possibility 
of the center remaining open dur- 
ing evening hours should be 
stressed with the large numbnr of 
mniried, evening students. 

AAA believes that students 
should have a fair opportunity to 
have their grievances heard. If 
desired, a student should he 
allowed to have a faculty member 
assist them in this goal. Counncl- 
ing in three areas should be united. 
A single counseling division lo

for this campus. 

AAA would like the students lo 
become more involved in the cnm- 
pus affairs, One way to do this is 
to put student government into the 
hands of the student body. This

E^ch student of this campus

AAA chooses . . . Able, Henson . , 



like to lake the "cliciucishacss" 
out of student government and put 
(student government) buck in the 
hiindt of the student body. We're 
inlcrestcd in the students on the 
campus — not just at ciceliun time 
but through the entire year. 

If elected president, I'm suggest- 
ing ive hnve an open door policy 
nnil also, I ivauld like to go out 
and see the students, Perhupa we 
could huve an area set aside in the 
cufctcria or the lounge that the 
students could come in nnd talk 
over their problems and I could 
relate to them what the student 
government is doing. ..This way, 
they ivould have a direct "in" to 
student government so it isn't an 
office down at the end of the 
cafeteria tbnl they hnve to go in 
and wait around to see somebody— 
that they know at leost once u 
week someone's going to care 
enough to be available to discuss 
the problems... 

M.S. Just how did AAA get 
slnrlcd? This isn't u parly we've 

J.C. No, this is u new parly. A 

group of students in communicn- 

and we thought perhaps as a class 
we could orgaaize □ campaign 
so we could have better student 
government here. Looking at the 
situation we decided that this 
would not be fair to the opposition 
so we have completely separated 
the classroom situation and the 
parly. The concerned students 
that many of you heard of last 
month that had two petitions here 
on the regional campus fiaally 
developed into what is now the AAA 
party-Abe lade Activists Assoc"!- 
Qtes. Peter Abelarde in the 11th 
century started the University oF 
Paris. He v«as a theologian nad 
educator. Ke picked this name 
as pan of our party name to empha- 
size thai this party stands for 
quality education. 



n the platform that 
s been developed by the ABC 
■ p. Able 






Able 



pointed out that point five oF the 
seven-point platform pertains to 
one minority group getting into 
office, "This is not to say thai 
minority groups should not be 
rcprescated in the Studenls' Gov- 
ernment. The duties of the gover- 
nment is to see that programs for 
minority groups are fulfilled and 
not to cotcr to juat one specific 
minority group." 

Khat type of guy is Brock Albe? 
"The Conservatives believe I'm 
a Liberal, and the Uberals con- 
sider me a Conscrvulive, mu I 
suppose I represent the student 
body," he explained. 

ABC vice-presidential contender 
James Henson attends Purdue 
University, where he is majoring 
in computer technology. He is d 
member of the l-P Student Senate. 
He has been a member oF the 
Senate's Appropriations Committee. 
In the past, he was active on the 
Student Council in high school. A 
graduate of Milford High School, 
Henson is from Milford, Indiana, 
and presently resides in Fort 
Wayne. 

■'ffc stand for the students; that's 

of the ABC party. He feels that 
"I he purpose of the Students' 
Government is to protect the stu- 
dents and provide the best facili- 
ties for obtaining their all-around 
education." He stressed "keep- 
ing in mind at aU limes the stu- 

'llie present l-P government, 
he feels, "is doing a tine job in 
its endeavors in making this a 
belter campus for all." 

Summiag up his ideas for the 
Students' Government, Henson 
said that what is necessary is 
"more student control: more pow- 
er to (he students and less pow- 
er to ihe administration."

IV. The Studrtt.-Go\ 
Parly 

As the University exists solely 
for the benefit of the students, 

students should share in univer- 
sity governance. The ABC has 

part in this task. 

1. Participation in more thnn 
30 advisory and decision-making 

2. Responsible and sensible 
action and words, so that these 
are more readily heeded. 

3. Complete self-governance in 
strictly student matters through 
definite, workable structure and 
business-like procedures. 

V. The Studcnl-ScTviec Party 
The Students' Government primary 
(unction is to serve the students. 
The ABC has made this its priority 
throughout the past year. 

1. Voter Registration 

2. Facilities for handicapped 
studenls 

3. Cinders in the free lot 

4. Sludenl Directory 

5. Faculty Evaluntions, with 
published results 

6. Free University 

7. Student Jobs on campus 

VI. The "Student Power" Parly 
The ABC StudenU' Government 
Administration of this past year 
worked hard to increase sludenl 

1. The Convocations Commit- 
tee was token awoy from the Uni- 
versity Administration and placed 
firmly under Student Control. 

2. The Student Activity Advisory 
Board, a board with appointed 
faculty members having veto pow- 
er over the Studcot Senate was 
abolished. Result— Student Con- 
trol 

3. Income earned by Student 
Activities was formerly regulated 
by the UnivetBity Administration. 
[t is now under Sludenl Control. 

In summary, the Alliance For 
A Better Campus has been serving 
the students of Indiana-Purdue 
University at Fort Wayne for the 
past year. While fulfilling our 
elev-en-poinl platform of last 
spring, we not only enhanced cam- 
pus life bul olso increased the 
students' power. Our efforts have 
resulted in the Studenls' Govern- 
ment being a respectable and re- 
sponsible spokesman For studenls' 
needs and opinions. 



In conjunction with our explicit 
purpose of serving the students, 
we pledge, that if elected, we will: 

1. Continue the business-like 
and orderly functioning of all 
branches of the Students' Govetn- 

2. Continue dovelopmenl of the 
social iilmospberc of this campus 
by cKpnnding nnd improving the 
programs of the Sludenl Union 
Board, the Convocations Committer 
and the Film Scries Committee. 

3. Work to ensure student con- 
tml of activities in and policies 
governing the Student Union Build- 
ing, 

-I. Continue the extensive ef- 
forts oF the Students' Government 
administralions of the pnst four 
years in advocating and working 
for a ainelc campus adminislra- 

5. Once ugain prevent the Stu- 
dents' Government For fulling under 
the influence ur control of special 
interest and outside groups. 

6. Ensure an expanded, high 
caliber intra-mural program appeal- 
ing to all students. 

7. Conlinuc expanding responsi- 
ble student power through student 
control oF student activities and 
student participation in Univer- 
sity governance. 

In the Student Body General 
Elections last spring, the Alliance 
For a Better Campus was elected 
to serve the students during the 
71-72 academic year, ffe Feel that 

oF us by our constituency. We 
stand by our record and out plat- 
form in our bid for re-election. 

AAA 

should bcmmade to the students 
concerning all student government 
activities. The studenls should 
have an opportunity to see and 
talk t. th govemnent officials at 
anytime. Also, the President 
coali set up o time each week to 
talk with the sludEnts in the cafe- 
teria and lounge. In this way, the 
students, individual students, 
ould be heard. 

AAA is looking Foreword to an 
open and clean election. They 
stand firm on thicr plalForai and in 
no way aim to degrade anyone or 
any party. AAA seeks quality 
education and equality for all sto- 
dents at Indiana-Purdue Regional

Dear Editors: 

While going thru last week's 
paper, I searched in vain for the 
classified ads as I had aa item ia 
them for sale. I laughed to my- 
self when I read your insert tor 
placing free ads since this had 
been the 5th week I had tried to 
get my "free ad" in the paper, 
\a I turned to the Inst page, eX' 
pecting to Had the classifieds, 
1 iaalead found aaothcr sermon by 
"Reverend" Souder for his upstand- 
ing morals and beliefs but I do aot 
feel [hat a college newspaper is 
the place for him to expound on 
his ideas about our "bankrupt 
morality." I am sure that if his- 
article usurps mare space than you 
anticipated this week, this letter 
will be the one lo suffer in that 
I will hove 16 "give a little here" 
instead of Mr. Souder "giving a 
little there."

"Land of the Aardvarks" 



Nothing is more inlcrcsling than 
u visit to the land of ihe aard- 
varks. Aardvarks, unlike most 
people, ore open-minded and easy- 
going. Nobody hos ever heard of 
an clhnocenlric aordvark. 

TTiere is a lot of "peace" aad 
"understanding" in the -land of 
the aardvorks. They "relate" lo 
one another. One aardvark doesn't 
Icll uuolhcr thai he's wrong, be- 
cause aardvarks know thai it's all 
just u mailer of opinion. They 
realize thai things only sccm 
"wrong" because of their environ- 
mcnl. After all, if ihcy'd of been 
born in France rather than Africa, 
their whole moral framework would 
have been different. 

For example, little aardvarks 
used to be told ibni ii ivns wrong

ivilh other aardvarks. Bui 
then Ihc aardvarks began fjues- 
lioning iheir elders. They exer- 
cised "roason". They became, 
well, rational eorlb pigs. 

'I1ic lililc aardvarks pointed out 
Ihc French aardvarks believed in 
free sen. No French aardvark 
would drcum of burrowing in with 
jusl one female. Tlie little aard- 
varks rculi/cj thai if Ihcv'd of 
been born Frencli aardvarks, ii'd 
all be different. So who's to say 
which philosophy is right? 

Of course, such a philosophy 
also happened lo please the horny 
little aardvarks. R. Aardvark, the 
sen symbol of ihe land, -had' u bull. 
Khy have tcslrictions: everylbiag 
is relative. The whole anrdvurk 
culture became one big celcbra- 



TJieir creator, Cod, dii 
culurly liLc ihe ohilosophv of 






the lillle aardvarks. He felt that 
ton many worshipped Abclard Aard- 
vark, the heretic who taught that 

the Word of God. God had made it 
painstakingly clear that little 
aardvarks would go to Hell for 
adultery or fornication, regardless 
of whether tboy were African or 
French. 

Aardvarks of every nationality 
had come from Adam Aardvark. 
They scattered over time, with 
sonic cultures abondoning God and 
developing ihcir own philosophies. 
But each aardvark is still governed 
by God's. Word, and in spite of all 
his "open-mindcdncss," and all 
his "ratinaatiiy," und all his 
"reason." each liltle aardvark 
will still be governed by the Word 
of Cod. 

God, as revealed through his 
Word, is not un African anrdvark 
creation. God is universal. God 
was before African aardvarks: He 
was not created bv ihem. God is. 
Tbc fad Ihat African aardvarks 
believe ia God and French aard- 
varks follow some dead aardvark 
who laughl lhat there was nothing 
better than a good lay, doesn't 
change the fact thai God says lhat 
fornicalion and adultery arc 
wrong. His commandments trans- 
cend aardvark wants, aardvark 
wishes, and the uatdvark's cn- 
vironmcnl. 

On the other hand, the Devil 
really loves ibe moral relativity 
of Ihe lillle aardvarks. Il's the 
Devil's aid, and fuels iheir way 
to the fim. And there's nothing 
the Devil likes better than roast- 
ed earth pigs.
