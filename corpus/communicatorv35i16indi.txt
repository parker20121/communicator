Coach Noll fired, Pechota takes lead 



By Nick West 



IPFW head men's basket- 
ball coach Doug Noll was fired 
on Wednesday, January 12, by 
athletic director Mark Pope. 

The official announce- 
ment was made at a noon press 
following day 



conference 
at the Hilliard 

Associate coach Joe 
Pechota was named interim 
head coach of a program that 
had lost eight straight games 
and was 3-13 under Noll this 
season. Pechota won his coach- 
ing debut on Saturday, Jan. 15 
against Youngstown State. 



Pope said he began to 
consider a head coaching 
change after traveling to the 
Butler game and watchinglPFW 
lose to the Bulldogs by 34 points 

IPFW was narrowly 
defeated by then 10-4 Middle

had possibly turned a corner,

—a 






pus senate meeting Ian. 10. 

In a discourse on the gen- 
eral welfare of IPFW, the speak- 
er for Indiana University faculty 
at IPFW, Brian Fife, made a pro- 
posal for a formal discussion 
on the matter. Fife prefaced 
that this was his opinion, but 
the proposal was supported by 
other faculty of both IU and

discussion of the issue.

increased maturity of

main reason for independence. 
The addition of campus hous-

changes seen to improve IP-

THE COMMUNICA 



Included in the senate 
meeting was a discussion of 
IPFW's financial standing in 
Indiana. IPFW ranks second to 
last (15 out of 16) in state fund- 
ing per student. Average state 
funding for IPFW is $3,856 per 
student, this is approximately 
half of what IU students re- 

The topic of indepen- 
dence was also debated in 1994, 
but was not formally proposed. 

If IPFW were to move for- 
ward on independence, that ac- 
ruld need approval from 



services at IPFW. The university 
also wanted to support its pol- 
icy to use email as the primary 
way of communicating with 
students for business matters. 
Features include 1 PFW an- 
link to OASIS, 
priority reg- 

student's records, finances, stu- 
dent news and events and other 
university services like webCT 
and webm&lt; 

and financial aid director Mark 
Franke said 52 percent of spring 
payments came through self- 
service such as web check, web 
credit card or voice credit card 
compared to the 28 percent 
last spring. Asofja'n. 17, 11,464 
electronic bills were sent out 
and 4,181 students had logged 
into the new mylPFW system to 
see their bill. 

Payments that came 
through mylPFW totaled 1,526 
while 1 ,073 paid by ecommerce 
through OASIS. The mail-in for 
payment reached one percent. 
Franke adds that students who 
receive financial aide to cover 
tuition do not actually pay any-

He said that students push 
for more "high tech self-service 
options" because the students 
know what they want to do and 
don't want to deal with things 
that may slow them down in the 
process.

Smith added that there

be unable to log into OASIS and 
register for classes. 

Junior Hachel Bisig has 
concerns about the digital sys-

would also rather go in person

On the other hand, junior 
Don Cunningham liked the new 

"I would use the website 
at home," he said. 

Cunningham would rather 
use mylPFW at home because 
it is more private than using a 
computer at school to pay for 
his bill. He also said part of the 
bill was unclear about payment 
because of the installment plan 
that he is on. but other than that 
he had no problems with it.

Questions of independence for IPFW 



At the lan. Ill ll'IW faculty 
senate meeting, Brian Fife, In- 
diana University's IPFW liaison, 
made a proposal for formal dis- 
cussion about making IPFW an 
autonomous university. 

We think this is a good 
idea, but not yet. IPFW is in its 
adolescent stages of develop- 
ment, the awkward period of 
growth between the childhood 
of a commuter campus and the 
adulthood ofa full-fledged rcsl- 



organizatlon si 

Fort Wayne University or Three 

Rivers University have been 

suggested in the past within 



die next few decades would be 
a mistake. So many students at- 
tend IPFW because they can get 
a degree from Indiana Universi- 
ty or Purdue University without 
having to spend the money to 



tween an 1U graduate or a Fort 
Wayne University graduate, the 

IPFW is growing in popu- 
lation and prestige to be sure. 
The anthropoid^ depart- 



t and the school of r 



linked with 1 
West Lafayette, though th 
medical school is arguably o 
of the best in the state. 

Inevitably, once or twi 



from our mothci 
and father campuses. 

We still have a long way tc 
go: dormitories, additional stu 
dent food options (with extend 
ed hours to encourage intra 
campus spending), and mort 
class options to name a few. 

Talking about it is all wel 
and good, but there is no point ir 
aiU'mptitig to stir enthusiasm ovc 



something as unrealistic a seced- 
ing from the union, as it were. 

When the time is ripe for 
autonomy, we will know it. The 
tudent atmospht 






ther semester is upon all of us. The 
eason has started to diminish from our minds, as 
s of another ai adorn k. semester start to occupy our 
thoughts. The fact that we've already tailed to keep the commit- 
ment to our New Year's resnlut s keep- nagging away at us, and 

the guilt keeps intruding into our mind. 

However, there is a ua\ tu keep yourself from feeling guilty 
about the lack ofcommitment and the vague notion that this 
year will be just as mundane as die last When I spoke with the 
Pro-Temporeof the Senate. Lamar Dixon, and asked what he 
suggested he replied. "He productive! Do something with your 
spare time by getting in vol veil and making a difference in our 
university." IPFW's student government is an excellent way to

tions and promises of a better, more fulfilling year. 

There are several ways to get involved with IPSGA, die first 
is through the SAB i. so idem Ac i niiy Board), and the second is 
through the Senate. Both avenues of involvement will surely 
benefit you in some way.

Oregon bill proposed to Students' perceptions of

(U-WIRE) EUGENE. Ore. - State 
legislation has been drafted in 
response to a proposed Uni- 
versity policy that could force 
suicidal students out of school 
if they continually refuse help 
It is unclear whether the legis- 
lation will actually impact the 
University of Oregon. 

Oregon Senator Bill Morri- 
sette requested the legislation, 
drafted by retired pharmacist 
lim Whittenburg on Thursday. 
Morrisettc called it a "student 
protection bill to make sure a 
student isn'l put on mandatory 
leave without due process." 

"We're protecting both 
the University and students by 
making sure they don't make 
any off-the-wall diagnoses," 
Morrisette said. 

But drafting the final lan- 
guage has been difficult be- 
cause the University has not 
released a copy of the proposed 
policy to the senator's office, 
he said. The Emerald has also 
been unable to obtain a draft of 
the proposed policy.

sel Melinda Grier said Monday

mind-altering drugs, such as 
antidepressants, in response

posed bill would, among other 
things, extend the rule to Or- 
egon colleges and universities. 

■ However, Health Cen- 
ler Director Tom Ryan, who 
helped create the new policy, 
said mandatory leave wouldn't 
hinge on whether high-risk sui- 
cidal students would take pre- 
scription drugs; rather, it would 
depend on whether they were 
still suicidal and unwilling to 
accept help after the proposed 
four mandatory meetings with 
ity psychologist or 



reported they're suicidal, have 

have a family history of suicide 
or have tried to commit suicide 
before. 

Ryan said students occa- 
sionally need help and are un- 
willing to accept it, estimating

The University proposed

said he felt placing the campus

"was not a very human way to 
look at things." 

Morrisette said he will 
wait to introduce the bill un- 
til he has received more input 
from the Oregon Student Asso- 
ciation and has had a chance to 
review a draft of the Universi- 
ty's proposed policy. Morrisette 
must introduce the bill by the 
end of February, he said. 

"I'm going to wait," Mor- 
risette said. "I'm not going to 



have a big war in my hands."

This experience isn't an 
isolated one for freshman stu- 
dent Victoria Chang and other 
minority students at the Uni- 
versity. 

With a campus that is 87

ensure that a student can be

points of common interests or

"It depends on the 
course," Tyrone Cherry, a junior 
in biology, said. "If it is a science

matter, but in a class like histo-

will be able to identify where

The availability of minor-

important issue -- not only on 
college campuses, but in the 
public school system as well. 
According to the NCDTF, ap- 
proximately 17 percent of stu-

teachers are.

greater in urban school systems.
