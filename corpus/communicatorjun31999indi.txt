Tuition higher 
due to low budget 
appropriations 



by CarrieAnne Lealhers, 
News Editor 



$iuJc'nts will have a raise in tuition and fees of 
5.5 percent for the 1999-2000 school year. 
Due to appropriated funding being low- 
ered bj the 1999-2000 budget bill, IPFW was 
forced to make the difference up in a higher 
luition increase than normal. 
'The tuition raising is a result of the slate 
not gi\'ing us quite enough money," said Michael 
Wartell, Chancellor. "We had to do it; it's not that much 
different." 

Most other Indiana universities also will raise their 
tuition for the 1999-2000 year, however the average 
Increase will be 3.3 percent. Wartell believes the increase 
to be quite minimal. 

-We're only talking about 1 percent higher than 
most other institutions," Wartell said. 

Students will be paying around S3, 534 for the 1999- 
2000 academic year if they attend full-time. This means 
that students will be paying approximate!)' S73 more for 
the year than if the increase had been only 3.3 percent. 

"There will probably be an even greater reliance on 
Hnancial aid for students and I don't know if that's a 
good thing. I've seen a lot of students go bankrupt com- 
ing out of school because their bills are so high and they 
can't find sufficient employment," said Jim Corson, stu- 
dent body vice president. 

Although the increased tuition may not be appreci- 
ated by students, Corson believes the media attention is 
beneficial. 

"One of the best things right now going on is that 
this is getting press time," Corson said. "1 think the com- 
munitj' is starting to reach a fuller realization of the high 
qualit&gt;' education available at IPFW." 



Funding short of IPFW's goals 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



"We will use the money for items that 



more expensive to pay for computer spe- 
cialists and instructors in the area of com- 
puter science, therefore more mone&gt;' is 
'^^^^^^^^^^~^^^^^^^~ needed to paj' them, as well as for equip- 

ment. Much of the budget will go towards 
State appropriations and funding for technolog)' expenses and Wartell believes 
the universitj's next t^vo fiscal years were technological advances help the entire cam- 
finalized earlier this month by the General pus &lt; 
Assemblj', 

"State appropriations fit with a 
formula, so we get our fair share, 
essentially," said Michael Wartell, 
Chancellor. 

However, the formula is deter- 
mined two years prior to when it 
actuall) takes effect, and although 
IPFW had decreasing enrollment two 
&gt;ears ago, enrollment is now on the 
rise. Therefore, appropriations were 
not enough. 

"If at the point where it takes 
mone)' away from us we are increas- 
ing in enrollment, we are decreasing 
the amount of money we get per stu- 
dent. This can cause great problems 
in our budget," Wartell said. 

One result of this has been the 
higher than normal tuition increase 
of 5.5 percent versus the average 
statewide increase of 3.3 percent. 
In the area of qualit&gt; improv 




receiving when the formula was originall)- 
set. Because IPFW was receiving consider- 
ably less funding 20-30 jears ago when the 
formula was made, e\en when the formula 
is raised the same amount for all universi- 
ties, IPFW still receives considerably less 
overall. 

"The formulas raise everybodj- the 
same amounts, so we asked for equtt&gt; 
monej' to fix that unfairness that 
occurred 20 or 30 &gt;'ears ago," 
Wartell said. 

IPFW asked for SI million 
starting next )ear and through the 
bill, was granted 62 percent of that 
amount for the following year 
(2000-2001). 

Wartell suggests the univer- 
sity should continue to try to 
increase funding. He also would like 
to see students taking pride in their 
education at IPIW. 

"We need to keep being 
\ocal about it and take pride in 
what goes on at this institution," 
Wartell said. 

Currently, IPFW is lowest in 
the state, along with three other 
universities, in terms of appropria- 
tions per students. Despite this,

One reason IPFW is still underfunded 
in comparison to other Indiana universities 
is due to the appropriations IPFW was

tions, are great teachers and really

have used resources ver^' well at this insti-

students here is better than other places 
have been able to do." 



IBM and lU Bloomington merge to form information network 



by Tracy Powell, 
Chief Reporter 



Indiana Universit)- will be making signifi- 
cant acquisitions of IBM hardware and soft^vare 
to further the university's Information 
Technology Strategic Plan as part of a recent 
agreement to work together with IBM to 
upgrade lU's information technology infra- 
structure and collaborate on joint research 
projects. 

"This far-reaching agreement bet\\een lU 
and IBM will make a major contribution to our 
goal of leadership in information technology," 
said Myles Brand, lU President. "We believe 
that the abilitj' to manage and store informa- 
tion assets, whether for research or adminisira- 



tion, as effectively and efficiently as possible, 
will be vital to the leading universities of the 
future and lU's relationship with IBM will 
ensure that we lead in this crucial area." 

IBM's soft^vare will enable lU to expand its 
storage system to provide extensi\e capacitj 
for researchers to store and access huge 
amounts of data. Students will be able to 
access this data from their personal computers 
using a Web-based interface being de\'eloped 
by lU. 

"Universities are moving from business-as- 
usual to e-business," said Mark Elliott, general 
manager, Marketing, Engagement and Business 
Development, IBM Global Services. "IBM is 
looking forward to working with lU, one of the 
countrj 's great research universities, to help it 
manage its information assets effecti\'elj for 



competitive advantage." 

The Bloomington campus will be one of 
the first educational sites in the world where 
students are prixj' to such large amounts of 
researched material. Once upgraded. lU's 
supercomputer will be the most poxverful com- 
puter at an&gt; uni\ersitj' in Indiana. The nqw 
supercomputer will support research in a \ari- 
et)' of disciplines including astronomy, sociolo- 
g&gt;', computer science and economics, and will 
allow faculty and IBM research and develop- 
ment teams to collaborate on a number of 
projects. 

"The abilit)' to store \'ast amounts of data 
will have an enormous effect on research at 
lU," said Michael McRobbie, lU vice president 
for information technologj and chief informa- 
tion officer. "This initiative will enable whole 



new research projects to be started in areas as 
diverse as data mining, astrophysics, high 
energy physics, and bio in forma tics." 

lU plans to use the IBM systems as the 
main computing platform for its new student 
administration, human resources, financial, 
librar&gt;'and research sj stems to be developed 
o\er the next fi\e jears. The servers will also 
support lU's new enterprise resource planning 
applications and other critical sj'Stems, includ- 
ing electronic commerce. 

The massive storage s&gt; stem will soon have 
two terabytes (two million megabytes) of fast 
disk space and another 57 lerabj tes of storage 
space on tape. In comparison, the entire hold- 
ings of the lU Library', nearly 5.7 million vol- 
umes, would amount to about 1.5 terabytes of 
information. 



Improvements to campus underway 



by Tracy Powell, 
Chief Reporter 



Improved lighting and heating are among many pro- 
jects currenti) underwaj' on campus this summer. 
Although the construction and renovation have caused 
disruptions, students and facultj are coping with it. 




"U is amazing how much is going on," said Kenneth 
Long, associate facultj' member in the department of phi- 
losoph}-. "Combine that with the work on the roads now. It 
is a lot," 

Currently, besides missing ceiling tiles throughout 
Kettler, the circle dri\e in front of Kettler has also been 
temporarily shut down and is being redone in order to put 
the parking spots on the same side of the drive as the 
building, therefore those parked do not have to cross the 
road after parking. 

South Campus Dri\e to Gold 
Dri\e is another area where it ma)' be 
difficult to drive until curbs and 
pavements have been replaced. 
Completion is expected at the end of 
Jul) , given that weather permits. 

In Ketder, currentiy the lighting 
is being replaced with newer, more 
efficient lighting and a sprinkler sys- 
tem is also being installed. Some of 
the rooms are also being updated 
after being vacated last &gt;ear b&gt;' the 
biolog) and geolog) departments. 

Heating ventilation and air con- 
ditioning boxes are also being 
replaced with new boxes to make it 
more efficient. 

Gas fired hot water heat is also 
replacing the electric heating in 
Kettler Hall, Neff Hall, and Walb 
Student Union. 

"We're doing this to save mone)' 
and we're able to pa)' for this work 
by the monej that will be saved," 
said Don Katter, project coordinator 
minimally with the physical plant department. 
In Walb Student Union ceiling 
tiles are also being replaced, but this 
and lighting replacements across 
campus are expected to be completed 
by the beginning of the fall semester. 
Although there is additional 
noise, commotion, and dust due to 
construction, complaints have been 
minimal and students have been 
adjusting since before the end of the 
spring semester when the more 
noticeable renovations began. 

"I'm onl&gt;' taking one class at 
night this semester so it's not been 
an inconvenience for me. But 1 have 
heard complaints about the lighting." 
said Jason Parrish, graduate student. 



Area activists plan 
protest against violence 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



As a call for nonviolence in 
the U.S. and elsewhere, urea stu- 
dents that recently formed a local 
chapter of the national organiza- 
tion Fellowship of Reconciliation 
(FOR) will be holding a peace vigil. 
The group will be meeting at 3 
p.m. on the south side of the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Bridge 
(Fourth and Clinton 
streets). 

"We are meeting 
on this bridge to 
show solidarit) with 
the innocent people 
in Yugoslavia who are 
being killed by our 
irresponsible bomb-

'Overqualified' 

by Mishanna Wood, Managing Editor 

America is one of the most advanced countries on the 
planet. 

Almost everyone lias a car, computer and a cell phone. 

People who don't have them may be viewed as "outdat- 
ed" and out of touch with the world. Advancement should 
be the (heme for America, &gt; ei man&gt;' people are "shut out." 

People go [o college to keep up with the ever- changing 
pace of this societ&gt;'. Howe\'er, sometimes the degree gained in 
attending college makes the person "overqualified" for the 
position they seek, according to emplojers. 

I don't understand how a person could ever be overqual- 
ified. 

One would think that a person of better training would 
be perfect for a position that requires education and training. 

An acquaintance of mine has 1 2 years of teaching experi- 
ence and a masters degree. 

Despite these credentials, this person can't obtain a posi- 
tion in his chosen field. 

Another person 1 know had worked as a chemist at a 
drug company for 25 &gt;ears and was permanentlj laid off. 

This person can't find a job as well, because of being 
overqualified. 

I think American businesses are willing lo accept second 
best because they don't want to pay more for the "overquali- 
fied" employee. 

Shouldn't they want the best? 

On a related note, large companies are packing them- 
selves up and moving out of the countrj'. 

The workers are cheaper there, making them more valu- 
able in the eyes of American businesses. 

Money has caused American businesses to forsake their 
country lo save a buck. 

By observable fact, the United Stales is one of the richest 
countries in the world. Why must we be so hungrj' for 

money and run our fellow countr&gt;'men into bad dmes or take 
away a lifetime of work? 

Has this land of opportunity turned into the land of 
greedy sellouts?

Funding at IPFW a 

WHAT WE THINK: Tuition increase is just 

anotlier result of being overlool&lt;ed lor 

funding. 

WHAT DO YOU THINK? Send your e-mail 

response to stupaper@holmes.ipfw.edu or a 

letter to Walb 215. 

The continuous lack of funds from the state has created 
another drawback for students on this campus. 

IPFW is falling behind. 

Not onlj' is there a lack of money to buy updated tech- 
nology and keep IPFW competitive with other schools, but 
there will also be a S.S percent increase In tuition and fees 
for the 1999-2000 school year. 

Administrators have been forced to raise the price of 
education because no other alternatives were available. 

The monej from the tuition increase was made to help 
make up for a lack of funding. 

Without a tuition increase, 
mone&gt; would have been taken from 
other resources such as programs 
and extracurricular activities. 

IPFW has the third highest 
increase in tuition out of all of the 
colleges in Indiana. 

The average increase among 
Indiana colleges for the upcoming 
year is 3.3 percent. 

We wonder what is going on 
here. 

Why can't this campus receive 
enough funds? 

Have the students done some- 
thing wrong? 

They are the ones who are being 
punished. 

Throughout the past school 
year, IPFW has been using almost 
every tactic in the book to gei legisla- 
tors to approve more money for this 
university. 

A legislative luncheon was held 
for facult)', members of the commu- 
nity and students to express the 



persistent problem 

needs of the campus. 

Students went to the state house and spoke with legisla- 
tors about funds for IPFW. 

Efforts such as these have been employed for years \vith 
few or no results. 

Last Februar&gt;. IPFW was ranked 14th out of IS schools 
funded b&gt; Indiana. 

Although 2.6 million dollars of funding was approved, 
IPFW will receive only a small portion of the money by 
2000-2001. 

It Is now tied at the bottom of the list with three other 
schools. 

The increase in tuition is &gt;'et another example of what 
neglect can do, 

We would like to know if there is an&gt;one out there who 
can answer this question: Why does IPFW remain on the bot- 
tom of the list for funds? 

Is there some t&gt;pe of standard IPFW is not measuring 
up to? 

The IPFW community desenes to understand why fund- 
ing is so low in order to launch an effective campaign to 
remed) this fiscal imbalance. 




LETTER TO THE EDITOR; Americans should 
know how their money can affect Mexican Indians 



by Jeff Brunson 

After several hundred 
years of genocide and ethnic 
cleansing against Indians in 
the New World, one might 
hope that the killers and 
cleansers would call it a daj-; 
the remnants of North 
America's indigenous people 
are, after all, either assimilat- 
ed into American societj' or 
concentrated on small 
reservations. 

Mexico, however, still has 
large numbers of unkilled 
Indians, and the same U.S. 
government which once 
emplojed massacres, forced 
stan'ation and biological war- 
fare (through the distribution 
of disease-infested blankets) 
against northern Native 
Americans now supports a 
brutal "low-intensity" war 
against Mayan Indians in the 
southern Mexican state of 
Chiapas, 

Since the Zapatisata 
rebellion on January 1, 1994 
(begun purposefully on the 
daj' the North American "Free 
Trade" Agreement was imple- 
mented). Mexico's govern- 
ment has poured military 
troops into Chiapas, and aug- 
mented its occupation and 
dismantling of indigenous 



societies with death squads. 

These "unofficial" groups, 
in turn, conduct some of the 
dirtier work, while allowing 
the Mexican militarj' to dis- 
unce itself from the results. 

One such result was the 
1997 Acteal massacre, in 
which 45 unarmed civilians, 
including 20 women and 14 
children, were slaughtered bj 
paramilitaries while an official 
military unit stood watch 
nearbj , 

The role of our own gov- 
ernment has been to support 
the blood)' repression of 
Chiapas Indians by giving 
scores of assault and trans- 
port helicopters to Mexico's 
air force and granting its mil- 
itarj' other weapon aid cour- 
tes&gt;- of U.S. ta.xpajers. 

Training for Mexico's 
Indian-kitlers is also provided 
and paid for, bj our tax dol- 
lars at the Georgia-based 
School of the Americas, whose 
graduates include Mexican 
officers responsible for mas- 
sacres, executions without 
trial and torture in Chiapas. 

The Mexican military, 
under SOA-trained officers, 
appears to know no limits to 
human rights abuses in 



Chiapas. They steal food and 
tradable goods from already 
■severely irnpoverished Indians 
with impunit&gt;; the&gt; rape 
Indian women and beat chil- 
dren as joung as one jear old 
with rifle butts, and are 
rewarded for such brutalit&gt; 
with escalating assistance and 
training b) our government. 

What I find particular- 
ly disappointing is the media 
silence in our own countr&gt; 
concerning this ongoing war 
against Indians. 

American citizens 
should have enough informa- 
tion to make informed judg- 
ments as to whether or not we 
want our tax dollars used to 
slaughter and repress Indians 
in Mexico, but this issue is 
almost ne\er telecast on TV 
networks owned b&gt; militarj' 
contractors, such as General 
Electric/NBC or 

Westingho use/CBS. 

Man&gt; of the newspapers 
in our country which editori- 
alized in support of NAFTA 
with benign-sounding claims 
that it would improve the eco- 
nomic and human rights situ- 
ation in Mexico, have had 
nothing to say about NAFTA's 
role in driving indigenous 



Mexican peasants off their 
farms, and lowering wages lo 
bare subsistence levels, while 
human rights violations con- 
ducted b) a military that 
we subsidize skjTOCket. 

This weekend, folks in 
northeast Indiana who would 
like 10 know more about this 
contemporar)' Indian war will 
have an excellent opportunitj 
when the Fort Wajne Cinema 
Center shows the documen- 
tar&gt;, "A Place Called Chiapas."

Books and Blinders: After 20 years student seeks college to enrich lifestyle 

by Darci L. Denton, Staff Writer 



The spring semester of 1999 was 
my first experience with high- 
er education. I graduated from high 
school in 1980 and turned down a 
scholarship in creative writing at 
Indiana State University the same 
year. 

Thai was a lifetime ago, and as 
always, hindsight is far greater than 
foresight. 

Majbe I should have gone to col- 
lege back then; I'm sure it would 
have made a significant difference in 
my life. 

I didn't know what I wanted 
then, much less what career I might 
be inierested in. 

Even now I don't know exactly 
what Iwant to do for a living, but 
being in the work force for nearlj- 
twenty jears has given me a lot of 
insight and I'm much more certain of 
what I don't want to do with my life. 

I think 1 assumed that all people 
attending college would be open- 
minded and hungry for knowledge. 

This is undoubtedly true of a 
substantial portion of the student 
body at IPFW, but an astounding 
number of the students I've come 
into contact with are here for one 
thing only. 



They are here for a degree and 
seem unconcerned with a deeper 
kind of knowledge, or what we call 
wisdom. 

Man&gt; are dogmatic in their 
beliefs, and although it can be good 
to know what jou believe in and to 
have convictions, I find it a bit scary 
that so many students (young and 
older alike) are not more open-mind- 
ed and willing to experience life from 
someone else's point of view. 

I guess I expected the younger 
generation lo think more like the 
young people of the 1960's, and 
quite probably 1 came lo this expec- 
tation, at least partiallj', because of 
the way the younger generation has 
attempted to copj the language and 
clothing stjle so popular with liberal 
young people back then. 

I'm not striving to be 
judgmental. 

I'm writing this to express my 
disillusionment and maybe because 
I'm just a little disappointed. 

The educators here at IPFW, at 
least the ones that I have had experi- 
ences with, are learned, well-read, 
eas&gt; to contact and connect with, 
and more than willing to help their 
students succeed and grow into 



thinking, knowledgeable members of 
societj'. 

There is so much here (and 
elsewhere) lo be learned, that I per- 
sonally can't imagine not taking full 
advantage of the opportunitj to 
leave mj- opinions at the front door 
each and every time 1 enter this uni- 
versitj' and fullj absorb any and all 
information to be found here. 

For me, opinions can change 
with new information. 

If I believe that I already know 
enough about life and ! hold the 
belief that no one can change mj' 
mind about anj thing and thai 1 
alreadj have life figured out, then 
whj' am 1 here spending mj hard- 
earned monej- on an education'! 

You may ask how I can condemn 
seeminglj unchangeable opinions in 
one paragraph and then in the next 
paragraph offer the reader my own 
seemingly unchangeable opinion 
about what a college experience 
should be like. 

If this is the case, I only have to 
say that I welcome opposing views 
and that I hope I'm wrong in 
my perception. 

I also want to point out the fact 
that my \1ews on learning are right 



for me and may not be right for ences of my life. 



another person. 

I appeal to those of you, though, 
that truly want to grow inleliectuallj , 
and are here for more than a piece of 
paper that will help you gel the job

All About the Movies 

Impressive 'Wars' can't live up to hype 




by Ben Freese 
Guest Writer 



When all of the hype for 
"Star Wars: Episode 1-The 
Phaniom Menace" began over 
a )'ear ago, I thought that this 
movie had belter be darn 
■good or else today's finicky 
movie-going audience won't 
be able to appreciate the 
incredible phenomenon that Is 
"Star Wars." 

Well, here we are one 
year later. 

The articles about 
"Phantom's" imminent release 



and success are gone, audi- 
ences have apparently alread)' 
gotten their fill of the new 
movie, nobody seems to be 
talking about it anjmore, and 
only a little over one week has 
passed since Us hugelj' antici- 
pated opening. 

1 ask mjself, "Why is this 
happening?" The answer is 
simple: No movie could ever 
Jive up to this kind of hjpe, 
not even "Star Wars," 

The original movie, "Star 
Wars-A New Hope" (Episode 
4, for those who don't under- 
stand all of this "prequel" talk 
about the new film), was the 




kind of movie that had little 
hope for success, 

George Lucas, the film's 
director, e\en stated that he 
just hoped ltd make back its 
S30 million dollar budget. 

Well, the film, despite 
lackluster test audience show- 
ings and mixed critical 
reviews, ended up raking in 
over S300 million and reigned 
as box office champ for quite 
some time. 

Obviousl)', the original 
"Star Wars" had the element 
of surprise going for it and 
wasn't the movie everyone 
was banking on to fund the 

studio's other film 

projects. 

Other produc- 
tion companies did- 
n't shut down to 
enable it to be a hit, 
the movie simply 
touched America and 
made an impact 
unlike anj' other 
movie all on its own. 
That's the big 
difference between 
the "old" three and 
the "new" three; the 
new film just tried 
too hard to be a hit. 

If it hadn't 
been marketed as the 
biggest movie of all 
time with quotes like 
"The new Star Wars 
may overtake Titanic 
as the number one 
box office champ," 
then it m a J 
have been more 
successful. 

The way it's 
going right now, 
despite setting 

records its first week, 
it appears the movie, 
ma\- fall way short of 
original expectations. 
Sure, it may 
wind up as the high- 
est grossing movie of ^ 



the year and a monstrous box 
office hit, but fans wanted it 
to be the biggest thing since 
the invention of the wheel. 

How could anj' movie 
ever hope to be so good that it 
could get this 1990s societ&gt;' to 
stick with it for so long? 

Oka&gt;'. Titanic did it. but it 
chugged along for months to 
get to that point and e\'ery- 
bod&gt; was constantlj' talking 
about it. 

For "Phantom Menace," it 
appears to have been the "in" 
thing to go sec and talk about 
when it first came out, and 
now it is starting to be just 
that: the flavor of the week. 

We'll see if it can make 
an&gt; money past its huge open- 
ing weekend or if it'll quickly 
and quieil)' disappear. 

The big question about 
"Phantom," though, is "Was it 
anj' good?" 

Well, the jurj- seems to be 
out on that one, as fans 
seemed to enjo) it, but not to 
the extent of what this "e\ent 
movie" was supposed to be in 
the initial planning stages. 

Critic responses were ver&gt;' 
mixed, but, then again, it was- 
n't any different for the origi- 
nal "Star Wars," and that did- 
n't stop it from being the leg- 
endarj' film it was or stop the 
hordes of people running out 
to see its re-release just tivo 
J ears ago. 

The fact is that "Phantom 
Menace" was a great movie, 
unfortunately geared more 
towards a 90s audience, Ei\'ing 
them the awesome special 
effects thej were drooling for 
but lacking in the "fun" aspect 
that the original movies rev- 
eled in. 

It's hard to explain, but 
the original mo\ie had charac- 
ters you could care about and 
never forget. 

It took those characters 
and threw them into, an elabo- 



rate journej through a uni- 
verse nobod) had e\er 
dreamed of before. 

This time, we've seen it 
before and nobod&gt;- knows the 
characters because the biggest 
weakness of "Menace" (other 
then a sometimes-annoying 
character named Jar Jar Binks) 
is the lack of character 
development. 

"Menace" doesn't create 
characters and put them in, it 
just thrusts these new people 
in and runs with them so that 
we can see the new "pretty" 
special effects. 

1 personally found myself 
wanting less of the special 
effects (which were ama/ing, 
although the) looked so com- 
puterized) and more of the 
storj' to emerge, 

1 mean, the)- create this 
great new bad guy. Darth 
Maul, and throw him into the 
story so infrequently that he 
barel&gt;' has any dialogue. 

Honestlj', the biggest 
complaint I heard was that 
people wanted to see more of 
Maul. 

I, for one, also wanted to 
see more of this guj who had 
the possibilit&gt;' of 
eclipsini 
Vader 



legendarj- Star Wars main bad 

Instead, Lucas fumbled 
the ball and onlj- let Darth 
Maul get to have an awesome 
light saber fight at the end, 
rather then actuallj- involving 
him in the storyline in a big 
wa\.' 

Among the pluses arc 
other characters portra&gt;ed by 
Liam Nceson, Ian McDiarmand, 
Samuel L Jackson, and Natalie 
Portman (plus cameos for 
Yoda, C3P0, and R2D2). 

The Anakin character 
came off great, but 1 was dis- 
appointed that Obi-Wan (Ewan 
NIcGregor) wasn't really devel- 
oped that much, although 
he'll have a chance for that in 
the next movie (Episode 2) 
which will focus more on his 
relationship with Anakin. 

Sadly, we'll have to wait 
three \ears for that slor&gt;' and, 
hopefulK next lime, Lucas will 
find a better balance between 
what the audience wants and 
what made Star Wars so great 
the first three times around.

Extreme 96.3 makes some noise at 




^^ 



There she is...Miss America. Courtney Love from the band "Hole" closed the evening's festivities. 



Photos and story 

by 

Jasen Savage, Staff Writer 



Hey there all jou summeriime scholars! 

Well, since I'm writing &gt;ou this piece of 
review, it can only mean that our sleepy little 
town has once again been privy to six strings 
of ampliHed rebellion, common!)' known as a 
rock concert. 

("Now honestly, why can't those kids play 
nice music, .like that Kcnnj- G fellow?!") 

The time: last Mondaj night. 

The place: the Memorial Coliseum, 

The event: the first annual Extremefest 



minipalooza. 

(This was the first, since it was "Edgefesi" 
in previous years.) 

Once again, five bands took the stage and 
fought like little troopers to see if they could 
create a legion of hoarse teenagers. 

The lineup was comprised of Hole, plajing 
the rollof anchor store, Orgy as second in 
command and Econoline Crush, Two Skinee 
Jays and Imperial Teen mixed in to add flavor. 

Sorry, no hometown heroes at this show. 

This show was a bit different for me than 
ones I have covered in the past. 

This time, 1 was armed with an all-access 
pass that allowed me to frolic in the flower 
fields of the backstage area. 

The dressing rooms were the onlj' no-n\' 
zones in the building for me. 

Once I had discovered that backstage 
wasn't all the se\-crazed lunac&gt; that I had 



hoped for, I just sort of hung out and waited 
for the first band to go on. 

Imperial Teen was the show opener, 
thumping the stage with songs from their two 
albums. 

This was the main band 1 had come to see 
and could do an entire review on them alone. 

If you're a fan of rock with an indepen- 
dent, well-crafted sound, check out their 
albums "What is Not to Love" and "Seasick." 

After their set, I was awaiting the perfor- 
mance of Econoline Crush when, lo and 
behold, what do I see as I peer into the crowd? 

I tell you brothers and sisters, 1 saw 
breasts! 



Breasts that were naked, with no clothes 
on even. 

Some of the crowd started lo get a little 
restless and tops began to come off, much to 
the enjoyment of surrounding 
spectators. 

First one girl popped up on shoulders, 
then another, then another, 

It was as if someone planted breast seeds 
in the crowd. 

The next band came on and, unfortunate- 
l&gt;, the only memoo that will remain with me 
from their set is the beer shower I received 
from some charming moron in the crowd. 

I was soon over that and ready to shoot 
Two Skinee Ja&gt;s. 

The&gt; came out in their red uniforms, yel- 
low helmets and part) , funk sound, leaving me 
to believe there had been a love child con- 
ceived between 311 and Devo. 

They had a good sound, decent choreogra- 
phy, and it will be interesting to see if they can 
make it through the dreaded "one hit wonder" 
waters. 

Next on the bill was Orgy. If you'll look 
carefully at the accompanying pictures, jou 
will notice that there are no pictures of this 
band to go with this article. 

This is because of some sense of punish- 
ment the Orgy people had, due to an object 
that was hurled at the stage. 

The stage lights went off, and the band 
played the first part of the set in almost total 
darkness, save for a couple of neon lights and 
a strobe. 

The other photographers that were there 
shared the same distaste for this unnecessary 
decision. 

Perhaps the band was afraid of some rabid 
New Order fans in the crowd. 

Finally, it was time for Hole to take the 
stage. 

Let me give you a little info on the general 
atdtude of this band. 

While waiting backstage earlier, we were 
all informed that Courtnej' Love was going to 
be walking from her bus to the dressing room. 

"Hey," I thought, "majbe I'll get to talk to 





Two Skinee Jays put showmanship into the songs, showing that uniformity 
isn't always a bad thing. 




Imperial Teen was the show's opener, as well as the favorite of photographer 
Jasen Savage.

HA! We wGre all told that 
we had to and hide in the 
shadows so she wouldn't see 
us. 

I was flabbergasted at this 
and had to avoid the urge to 
jump out as she walked b&gt;' 
and yell "Happ)' birthday!" 

Just before the Hole set, a 
couple photographers and I 
were herded behind the 
bleachers and were told to 
wait until the band was

with fans and radio people 
backstage. 

This show was a different 
experience for me as opposed 
to others I have done. 

Usually, I have plenc&gt;' of 
horror stories about security 
guards but this time it was a 
Cakewalk. 

The show was a good time 
and the audience seemed to 
enjoy themselves. 

Except for Orgj's love of 
the dark and Courtney's pri- 
madonna attitude, it was a 



not so temperamental, successful night. 



Huzzahs and kudos to the 
Extreme people for putting 
together another show to cut 
through the monoton&gt; of life 
in this town. 

It would be great to see 
more acts roll through here on

Men's Cross Country team signs eight local recruits 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 



After finishing a iubpar season, (he 
men's cross counirj leam knew that 
things needed lo thange if ihej' wanted 
to compete in the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference. 

In March, Robert Waterson was 
named head coach of the Men's Cross 
Country team and had many goals in 
mind. 

Two of Waterson's goals included 
recruiting players close lo home and 
becoming one of the best teams in the 
conference. 

Waterson set out and signed him- 
self eight recruits, starting with three- 
time all-state distance runner Michael 
Watts from Westview. 



Watts has recorded a 9:24 two- 
mile time and a 2:01 800 meter- 
Mike Seevcrs of Prairie Heights was 
also on Waterson's list. He has record- 
ed times of 4:35 in the 1600 meter and 
2:01 in the 800 meter. 

Waterson also snatched up a trio of 
Northeast Hoosier Conference runners 
in Dekalb's R&gt;an Middleton and Chad 
Bcattj' and Carroll's Steve Girardot. 
The three consistently have 5K times 
around 16:25-10:45. 

Girardot sums up the altitude of 
the freshman class stating, "I am ver&gt;' 
excited to be with such a talented class. 
I feel we will step up immediately and 
help the gu)s that ha\'e been here and 
help bring a winning program here to 
Tort Wajne."

the attitude that Girardot spoke of. 

"This is an exciting group of &gt;'0ung 
men who have some advanced running
