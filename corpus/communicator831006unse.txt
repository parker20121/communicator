"The staff Is there to lay oul all the 
options for the president," Pallcrson 
said The oplions arc vital to smooth 
operation of the executive branch of 
government, he added 

The president must know every 
possible avenue when making 
decisions. Patterson said. 



Patterson's second poinl referred to 
staff responsibilities regarding sen- 
si live issues He cited busing and school 
segregation during the 1960s as Issues 
While House slalf members were "to 
keep buried in their vest pockels." 

Nixon, for example, thought die 
subject matter was "too sensitive lo be 
considered in open discussion." Pal-

held until official policy was formalized

Pallcrson emphasized five points In 
his lecture to clarify the use of the 
White House staff. 

The firsl poinl was. "Ihe president is 
president of Ihe entire executive slaff." 
Patterson said. "The entire choice of 
decisions slays in one person's hands 
and lhat one person is the president." 

There is grcal pressure on the 
president, he said, and for him to make 
acceptable decisions, his slaff must 
"give il linfarmalloni la the president

tact*," 

After hearing all aides of an Issue, ihe

formation intended lo help the 
president make betler decisions and 
focus on problems before Iney leak lo

other departmen is or agencies. Pat- 
terson said 

Presidents need many sources of

times presidents will ask. "Whal arc

One nl the more difficult problems in 
government, Patterson said, is when 
deparimcnls and agencies are reluc- 
tant lo give presidents bad reports and 
try to painl a good picture instead. 

Patterson's fourth poinl referred to 
policy im piemen lalion. 

If policies are challenged, it's Ihe 
staff's responsibility lo carry Ihem out. 
Patterson said.

an example.

New Pride-Fort Wayne, a group of local 
businessmen, have for Die past several 
months been Irying lo acquire some land and 



in I960, to be used for the sladium. 

The land, leased lo 1PFW unlit HS9 al fl n 
year, is located west of the St. Joseph River. 
fPFW's alhlcbc fields were located on lhal 
land unlit last spring. 

The county wanted to put its proposition on 
Ihe agenda for the Indiana -Purdue Foun- 
dation's annua] meeting Sept. 20. It didn't get 
on Ihe agenda. Carol Gulman, president of the 
foundation, said in an article published by

said Ihe land is needed tor passible luture 

separated Irom the res! oi the universily by a 
river. Any future growth on lhal land would 
require Ihe building of a pedestrian bridge 
Why don't Ihe foundation members, Ihe 
administration and the students' government 
sit down with Ihe commissioners and hear 
their proposal Maybe a deal could be worked 
out where IPFW could use the sladium for 
home games. Maybe Ihe NCAA someday will 
consider IPFW for a possible baseball 

Both Ihc city ol Fort Wayne and IPFW 
would benclil greatly from Ihe stadium, so 
lei's slop dragging our feel and give Ihe land 
back lo the county and let it build the sladium.
