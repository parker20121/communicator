Alumni Spotlight 



Grad dances to eclectic mix 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



B everyone wants to know if there 
is life after graduation. Elaine 
Linder is living proof that there 
is. 
Elaine is a 1990 graduate of 
Northrop High school in Fort 
Wayne. 

In 1995, she graduated from IPFW 
with a degree in psychology. 

Her road to a professional life may 
seem smooth, but it was actually quite 
rocky with indecision. 

Directly after high school, Linder 
spent two years at IPFW, her first at any 
college. 

Elaine spent the next two years at 
DePauw University in Greencastle 
before settling down at IPFW for the 
final two years of her studies. 

Each lime she attended IPFW. 
Linder was heavily involved with the 
Student Activity Board (SAB) and the 
University Singers. 1 

When she began her post-secondary 
educational pursuits, Linder, like many 
college students, was unsure of what to 
study. 

"I thought aboul elementary ed„" 
she said. "Then I was undecided before 
ending up in psychology." 

Currently, Linder works for Arts 
United of Greater Fort Wayne as a 
Creative Alternative Program Grant 
Administrator. 

Linder describes her work of the past 
two and a half years as "(the) funding of 
art programs for disadvantaged 
teenagers." 

She shares her enthusiasm for her 
work in the following manner: "I 
encourage artists and youth-serving 
organizations (0 plan a program and 
come 10 us for funding." 

Given Linder's bubbly personality, it 
is no surprise that she "loves to be ihe 
center of attention." 



The single 26-year old spends Lime Nol conient with full-lime work and 

hanging out with her friends and her sis- a part-lime school schedule, Linder is 

ler. also youth coordinator al Gethsemane 

Most of her free time is spent danc- Lutheran Church. She enjoys planning 

ing. Her favorite type of music and fun, recreational and service projects for 



dance is disco. 

Linder can be 
found enjoying 
reiro-night at a 
local establish- 
ment, when her 
schedule allows. 

Although she 
has fun in lbe 
existing clubs, 
that has not 
stopped Linder 
from imagining 
how things could 
be better in the 
local entertain- 
ment arena. 

"My enter- 
tainment dream 
for Fort Wayne is 
lo have a club 
with one floor of 
70s and 80s 
music, and one 
floor of synth- 
pop," she says. 
"And no seals." 

She paused. 
"Well, at least 
more dance floor 
than seats." 

A more seri- 
ous dream of 
Linder's is thai 
there would be an 
end to violence- 
not just in Fort 
Wayne, but every- 
where. 

Although she 
has already 
obtained a bache- 
lor's degree, 
Linder is- currently 
taking a Spanish 
class to satisfy her 



the youth of her church.

Curing the sexual assault epidemic 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Sexual assault is a problem without 
boundaries or discrimination. 

Because of ihe seemingly epidemic 
numbers of this offense, April has been 
designated as Sexual Assault Awareness 
Month. 

Sexual Assault Awareness For 
Everyone tSAAFE) recently hosted an 
appearance by professionals from ihe 
Sexual Assault Treatment Center. 

The Sexual Assault Treatment 
Center is an independent agency ihat 
works cooperatively with hospital and 
police departments in supplying neces- 
sary aid and treatment to sexual assault 
victims. 

The center has recently moved ils 
location and expanded its services. 

The center made iis debul in Fori 
Wayne about one and a half years ago. 

Fort Wayne is one of the few areas in 
Lbe United Slates equipped with a facili- 
ty of this nature. 

The nurses who staff ihe center have 
a greal deal of expertise and are avail- 
able 24 hours a day, seven days a week 
and even on holidays. 

'They are always available," said 



Christine Zielinski, director of ihe 
Center for Women and Returning 
Adults. 

The recent presentation by the 
Sexual Assault Treatment Center on 
April 20 was the last in a continuing 
series on sexual assault. 

The series included talks by profes- 
sors John and Susan Parrish-S prowl on 
date rape and 
talks from repre- 
sentatives of the 
Fort Wayne 
Women's 
Bureau, entitled 



"People 
think it/s 

a terrible 
thing that 
happens 
to other 
people." 

-Christine ZJeinjkj. 
Center for Women inc 
Returning Adults 



"Risky 

Business." 

Essentially, 
ihe center strives 
to help victims in 
both the most 
fundamental and 
important ways, 
which include 
things like gath- 
ering appropriate 
evidence of Ihe 
attack. 

More specif- 
n case the victim 



that the term sexual assault applies to all 
of the forms. 

"Il's very encompassing," Zielinski 
said. "It can mean every type of sexual 
assaulL" 

Zielinski thinks that Ihere is no sec- 
tor of (he population lhat is immune 
from ihe effects of sexual assault. 

"People think it's a terrible thing that 
happens to other people, even if it does- 
n't happen 10 them personally," said 
Zielinski. 

Zielinski also stresses the impor- 
tance of learning about sexual assault. 

She points out that because people 
may know someone who will be a victim 
of sexual assault, everyone should be 
educated on the Issue of sexual abuse. 

"They may have a friend or relative 
thai it will happen to. They should be 
aware of what to do and should iry to 
help people who have gone through it, to 
help them deal with it," she added. 



ic evidence is gathered i 
decides to prosecute. 

The center also provides medical 
treatment for the victim. 

Zielinski points oul Lhat the center 
treats every form of sexual abuse, and 



The Center for Sexual 

Assault is located at 

800 Broadway, Suite 301. 

The center can be reached by 

phone at 425-3333, 840-7144, 

or by pager at 430-0369. 



To stumble twice against the same stone is a proverbial 

disgrace.

What is your Senator DOING?? 



I hi' Student Senate has, under 
Ibc fearless leadership of Jeff 
Sterling, decided lo use the distribu- 
tion of your student fees in a politi- 
cal matter. I should say fearful and 
not fearless. 

Whenever the mass communica- 
tion comes into direct conflict with 
the ruling party's goals. The idea is 
to CUT THAT AVENUE at the 
knees so it cannot work. 

The Allocation Committee was 
charged with putting together a bud- 
get proposal for the Student 
Government at IPFW. The Senate, 
under Mr. Sterling's bad advice, has 
taken it upon themselves to REDO 
the committee's recommendations 
and start over. 

Tin- Senate cannot make a wise 
and just decision with the lack of 
information they have received It is 
too late for them to receive more 
unless they want to drag tbis into the 
next Senate, which means what they 
do now is for nothing, 

The Allocation Committee met 
and cut many programs. Some of 
these programs are being used for 
political gain by people who do not 
favor certain programs because 
those programs are not in their best 
interests. That program being The 
Communicator, I will be one to say 
The Communicator is not the best 
written, but I will also say The 
Communicator needs to be here if 
for no other reason to keep everyone 



in check with each other. 

President Kevin Orttunaii stated 
at the Senate meeting on April 20 
that there are many student newspa- 
pers of campuses of our size that arc 
self-sufficient. It is easy to say that. I 
do not doubt this word. This is the 
time for facts. 

The Allocation Committee 
made cuts to almost every group. We 
made cuts that the groups could 
recover from. We cut the fat, not the 
bone. We submitted a budget lo the 
Senate that was $4,533 in a deficit. 
After more discussion with Mr. Dan 
Gebhan, the money should be in the 
balance forward from this year, so 
the budget submitted should be in 
balance. 

Mr. Sterling is placing tbis into a 
political battle because the 
Allocation Committee deemed it 
necessary to only give the student 
Senate an INCREASE of 5 percent. 
About the same increase from the 
Student Activity fee this year. 

Because be did not get his 
$40,000 allocation for Senate, he 
wants to cut every program he does 
not feel Student Service money 
should pay. 1 agree that there are 
things the Student Service fee 
should not pay for, but we have to 
decrease the amount slowly. 

Allocation Committee cut the 
Communicator's budget by 14.71 
percent. Mr. Sterling's actions would 
cut the Communicator by 25.83 per- 



cent which is NOT RECOVER- 
ABLE. The Communicator would 
more than likely die. 

Tbis is coming from Mr. Sterling 
who has said in a Senate meeting, 
that if the Communicator needs 
more money to investigate 
Chancellor Wartell the Senate wdl 
find more money for tbe 
Communicator. 

Upon talking to Doric Reynolds. 
a S3 1,050 allocation would just 
make the Communicator more 
resourceful in making financial deal- 
ings this next year. We did not fund 
the complete $36,406 even though 
we, being the Senate, placed the 
Communicator in those hard limes. 

The Allocation Committee voted 
lo pay for the increases in printing, 
but left the loans made due (o a pre- 
vious Senate's actions unpaid 

There is a copy of the budget 
presented to the Senate in the 
Student Governments office along 
with all tbe requests. You arc more 
than welcome to look at these. 

TALK TO YOUR SENATORS 
AND TELL THEM WHAT THEY 
ARE DOING IS WRONG! 
STUDENT FEES ARE NOT 
POLITICAL, THEY ARE WHAT IS 
BEST FOR THE STUDENTS! 

Chuck Newman 

Vice-President of Legislation-Elect 



Right back at ya, Mr. Adkins 



To the Editor 

1 would like lo respond to 
Kerry Adkin's bashing of me in 
the April 16 edition. 

Adkins states that I have 
"failed to see that the IPSGA is 
just a puppet government used by 
the administration lo push 
through any and all increases in 
student service fees, the reduc- 
tion of new fees and any other 
propaganda that they wanted to 
show student support." 

My response: That is a lol of 
bullshit Mr. Adkins. IPSGA is the 
"Sludenis Government!" If you 
want to put some blame some- 
where, my suggestion is the 
administration of IPFW, NOT 
Daniel J. Westrick, Kevin 
Orthman or Mark Spninger. 

Case in point: Last year. SAB 
was going to do an off-campus 
party called "House Bash 1998." 
Tbe party was going to have beer 
and pop, and our ads said, "18 to 
get in, 21 to drink" or something 
like that. 

The reason why we (SAB) 
did not put on the event is 
because Ihe administration pulled 
the funding. Not IPSGA. 

If I was elected this year 
there would have been off-cam- 
pus parties every month! 

Plus. Mr. Adkins stales ibat 
he WAS a member of IPSGA. 



Well, "was" is in the past, and 
currently I am a member. 
Remember Mr. Adkins, that there 
was a movie night here. If I was 
elected. Movie Night would have 
been back. 

Then he says, "What fun will 
it be to have a big name aci like 
Ms. Crow and Aerosmilh come 
to the university for an outdoor 
concert and not have the students 
pay a dime to sec it " Mr. Adkins, 
SAB tried that this year with 
Traccy Lawerence and Trace 
Adkins! 

However, the students failed 
to come lo this event. Like other 
events, the attendance was bad! 

Case in point: Craig Kargess. 
Only 10 people showed up! Ten 
and that event was free. And if 
we wanted to bring a big name, 
like "Carrot Top," it cost money 
which SAB does not have. For 
this year, SAB got $80,000 to 
spend on events/prqgramming up 
until (his summer. Wc put 
SI 5,000 of that for tickets for that 
concert and offer to the students 
at a low cost. These names 
Adkins talks about cost at least 6 
figures! SAB's budget only has 
5 ! What happened ? Of the 1 500 
tickets we got, only a lilUe over 
100 were sold. 

Plus, that student service fee 
money goes to fund other organi- 



sations, like the IPFW Forensics 
League, United Scxualities, even 
this paper! Jusi ask any person of 
that staff and they will tell that 
some of their money comes from 
IPSGA! 

Lei me tell what IPSGA has 
done in Ore past. Last year. 
IPSGA sponsored an event where 
the City of Fort Wayne, business 
and other city organizations. 
came to IPFW. 

That event was a success and 
was done by my very good friend 
and campaign manager. Mrs. 
Gina Burgess. I bave done Vegas 
Night for the past three years and 
I got credit for that! 

Mr. Adkins ended with this 
statement, "Open your eyes Mr. 
Westrick or better yet pull the 
wool from them ." My eyes are 
wide open and I was not bom 
yesterday! I know what is going 
on. 

At least, I am a part of the 
answer, you are part of the prob- 
lem. Mr. Adkins, for Ore love of 
God, face it. You lost and since 
you can not live with that fact, 
my advice: Stan worrying about 
your problems and stop attacking 
people with no reason, 

Daniel J. Westrick 
IPFW Student

Well, what can we say? After the 
past week of being slapped in the 
face by our administration, our sen- 
ate and our college it's a wonder wc 
can see through our swollen eyes lo 
produce your student newspaper. 

The latest smack felt across our 
already warm cheeks comes from 
our Student Senate. 
Apparently, the Senate 
isn't getting as much 
money as Ihey had 
planned. 

Therefore, they are 
having to cut the budgets 
of student organizations 
across the board in order 
to compensate for the loss 
of funding. 

One of the original 
budget plans presented 
contained a cut of 25 per- 
cent for us. We can barely 
operate on the budget we 
are allotted now And it's 
a rather shameful budget 
compared to the student 
newspapers we compete against 
every year. 

If these budget cuts are 
approved, the chances of YOU hav- 
ing a student newspaper this sum- 
mer are small. We have decided to 
fight the good Tight and try to pre- 
vent this from happening. 

After all, who will report the lat- 
est administrative happenings or give 
you information concerning YOUR 



campus/ 

No one. If we arc no longer here, 
who is going to keep labs on the peo- 
ple with power on this campus? 
Where will you go to veni your 
bitches and to keep in touch with 
your campus community? 

Who are you going to seek the 
truth from ? The 
Administration? We 
don't think so. 

This is YOUR 
money they are spending, 
or rather, taking away 
from your student news- 
paper. These are the peo- 
ple YOU elected and 
have decided to let man- 
age YOUR student ser- 
vice fee money. We real- 
ize that these officials 
have been placed in this 
position by the adminis- 
tration, but these same 
people are also expected 
to act in the student's best 
interest in the end. 
It is YOUR responsibility to 
beat down their door and let them 
know YOU are not happy with their 
actions. 

Unless of course, you don't mind 
Big Brother telling you everything 
i hey decide you need to know. 

But you'll bave to stand in line 
behind our staff. We aren't going 
away without a knock-down, drag-' 
out fight 



APPROVED, THE 
CHANCES OF YOU 



HAVING A STUDENT 



NEWSPAPER THIS 



SUMMER ARE 



Food for Summer Students! ! 



Thorn In Mi/ Side: Susan Spii 



A few issues ago 1 wrote a "feel- 
good'' piece regarding the cafeteria 
and its contracted service providers, 
Aramark. In that article Scott 
Pearson, a member of the Aramark 
management team, stated that some 
changes would be taking effect that 
would benefit the student body of 
IPFW. 

Well, a few of you have brought 
it to my attention that some of these 
changes-to-be haven't been imple- 
mented. So, I made my way back to 
the cafeteria to discuss these con- 
cerns with Aramark. 

One of the major complaints that 
was voiced to me was tbe lack of 
food after 2 pm. In my article, 1 
reported, that the soup and salad bar 
would be available until 4 p.m. 
Apparently, this hasn't been the 
case. I, myself, went down a few 
times last week to check on this 
information and found it to be true. 
It was 1:50 p.m. and the salad bar 
and soups had been removed. I 



found this a little disconcerting, con- 
sidering I wrote that changes would 
take place and they hadn't. 

"I'll lake care of that," stated 
Pearson when I brought this to bis 
attention. "We've been very busy 
switching things around." 

We'll see, I'll be watching! 

Now. on to the good news for 
the students. 

First, and most exciting, for the 
first time there will be food service 
during the summer sessions. 

"Please, help us and support our 
efforts," said Pearson. The cafeteria 
and Kenler Kart will close on May 
8, but the Kcttler Kan will re-open 
on May 18. The hours of the Kan 
will be from 11:30 a.m.- 1 pm. 
Monday-Friday. "The Friday hours 
are tentative and will be based on 
amount of students having classes 
on that day," said Pearson. 

Then beginning in mid-June and 
continuing through August the cafe- 
teria will be open due lo a depart- 



mental program ihat will bring in 
high school students who will be 
eating breakfast, lunch and dinner 
here. So. Pearson has decided to 
welcome all students, staff and fac- 
ulty at these times as well. The menu 
will be limited, but ii is a place to eat 
on campus! 

The prices at the cafeteria have 
also dropped. The main entree's 
bave seen the most recognizable 
reduction in price. 

Some entrees that were costing 
customers S4.59 have now been 
reduced lo S3.79. 

Aramark also offers "frequent 
buyer" cards for their customers, 
Tnis allows them to buy seven ala 
cane or entree meals and get the 
eighth one free," said Pearson. 

There arc still a few bugs that 
need working out, but all in all the 
new management team of Aramark 
are slowly making improvements for 
the sludenis.

I am frustrated and absolutely livid at this partic- 
ular point in time. It seems that The Communicator's 
budget is about to be slashed by approximately one- 
ihird by the Senate (that we staff members helped 
elect, mind you). 

The cuncnt understanding is that they seem to feel 
that we should be a fully self-sufficient student news- 
paper, one not supported al all by student activity 
fees. Fine and dandy, people. However. I venture to 
say that there are some points that 
you should keep in mind before 
making this cruel decision. 



It is pathetic, 
disappointing and 
disheartening to 
attend a campus 

that doesn't 

support its student 

organizations. 



1. The Communicator staff just 
returned from the Indiana 
Collegiate Press Association 
awards. We won 17 awards In 
Division II for this little-bilty 
paper that some members of the 
Senate seem set to destroy. Not 
loo bad for what we can accomplish 
with the few resources and outdated 
technology that we make due with 
every week. 

We had a hard lime competing 
with those other schools who have 
buge budgets and all the latest tech- 
nological advances. Somehow we 
still managed to walk away from 
there with 17 awards and our heads 
held high. Thai was a tough thing to 
do, considering the fact that we can barely keep up 
with them now. and it ^eems thai budget cuts will only 
make things worse. The car rides home were depress-

2. We were the only Fort Wayne representatives at 
this conference. No other Fort Wayne-based universi- 
ty was there. This contest has awards in categories for 
yearbooks, newspapers, news magazines and literary 
magazines. IPFW only bad a newspaper enter the 
competition. What happens when we don't even have 
that anymore? Doesn't this bother anyone?? 

3. We have tried to get outside grants and funding. 
However, wc get refused by foundations, as they tell 
us that we should be "getting money from our univer- 
sity."' Hmmm. We aren't getting supported by our uni- 
versity. 

Our own administration doesn't whole-heartedly 
support us To their defense, we don't print exclusive- 
ly "rose -colored" images of this campus, but our job 
is to report the news Unfortunately, bad things are 
news just as much as are bappy things. Ignoring things 
doesn't make them just go away. 
4. 1 bad fully intended to work together with IPSGA 
and the Senate to achieve goals that included building 
some school pride, increasing student participation in 
events; after all, we all bave the same aims and may as 
well get ihem accomplished together. It's no secret 
that there isn't a heck of a lot of 

school pride here. This paper has 

the abibty to make a difference and 

help this school flourish. We bave 

the ability to make a visible, imme- 
diate difference. 

Sadly enough, the cynism that 

abounds here seems to bave actual 

merit. That is so sad It would be 

nice to blow off the negativity and 

blame it on a few whiny people. 

However, I can no longer do that. 

These problems are real I bave just 

exoerienced them, personally, for 



the very first time, and I don't like them al all. 
5. Those of us who work at this paper aren't here jusl 
for fun, you know. We actually work every single day 
of every single week. We work weekends. We work 
nights. We put in more work than many other sludent 
organizations on this campus ever do. We do Ihis 
because it makes us proud. This is my job. This is 
something that prepares me for Ihe future. Granted, 
ihere are things thai 1 plan to do diffcrendy if I am in 
charge, but for the most part, this is a dam good paper. 
We've got 17 awards to prove iL Why destroy some- 
thing lhat woiks?? 

I have news for you: We will nol be censored. We 
will noi be bullied. Just because you bave found a 
"legal" way to censor your only source for student 
information on ihis campus doesn't mean that we will 
take it lying down. After all. this is my job, and I quit 
a high-paying, full-time, career-track job to work here 
because I loved il so much. I won't be quiet about this. 
It is pathetic, disappointing and 
disheartening to attend a campus that 
doesn't support its student organiza- 
tions. If you think that there is little studenl 
pride in IPFW now, making such horren- 
dously-contrived decisions will only per- 
petuate the laissez-faire attitude that is felt 
towards Ihis university. 

1 myself have lost all faith in this 
institution. As the editor-io-bc, it will be 
awfully hard for me to print nice things 
about this place when I am being stabbed 
in the back by the very people that 1 
elected to represent my best Interests. 

If this paper goes under because of 
financial problems, and I lose the job thai I 
care so much about, I can guarantee you 
that I will be running for the student Senate 
next year. 

Someone needs to make decisions 

that will make this campus a better place. 

Someone needs to do the job lhat they are 

elected to do. If necessary, maybe 1 will just have to be 

lhat person. 

Power seems lo have a very bad effect in the 
hands of certain people on ibis campus. Maybe those 
people need lo be removed from office if they cannoi 
control themselves. Just a thought. 

I would like to be able to attend the 1CPA confer- 
ence and awards next year and brag lo Ball State, 
Indiana Stale and DePauw representatives about how 
our university supports us and makes us feel like we 
provide a real service lo the student body, just like 
they did this yearlo us. 

Bui I can't. I can't even say that our university 
likes us. I can't brag about a whole heck of a lot at ail. 
All I con do is bitch and complain, and that's not 
exactly the image that I wanted to project. 
Unfortunately it's all lhal 1 have. Thai is truly, truly 
sad. 

If The Communicator is not here lo service ihe 
studeni body and faculty, who will? We are ihe most 
active organization on this campus, nol lhat anyone 
really seems lo care or notice. 

We are taken for granted on an almost-daily basis. 
I feel thai I sure don't have much to look forward to if 
1 become your editor, and I haven't even done any- 
thing yet. What a nice outlook.

Denting opinions about the issues 



what's weak this week: Dennis 
Donahue 



1 guess bomb threats are taken 
seriously. Anymore of you want a 
piece of the IPFW Police 
Department? I hope Ihey (Klotz 
and Drake) gel into a bunch of 
trouble, nol jusl kicked out of 
school. I laugh when I think about 
seeing them in court. I mean, did 
they really think they would gel 
away wilh il? Treai'em like crim- 
inals, that's what I say. Make ihem 
pay everybody back what was 
lost. Lei's sec, lhal would cover 
gas, professors' salaries, child- 
care, law enforcement and other 
miscellaneous dollars. They can 
cut me a check for aboul $150, 
considering 1 missed three classes 
and one exam. And that's all I 
have lo say about lhal. 

What else is bugging me? I 
actually have a couple of things 
on my mind (what a shocker). 
What's up with the stuff on televi- 
sion these days? A quick tip; if it's 
"made-for-tv", it will be terrible. 
And is it me or does the FOX net- 
work still create and produce 
mind numbing, non-intelligent 
crap? How aboul Warner Brothers 
network. Are these writers who 
couldn't make il in ihe real world? 
Kill your television, except for 
ESPN of course. 

How come telemarketers call 
my bouse everyday? Did you 
know lhal if you ask lo be pul on 
ihe "Do Nol Call" list ihey are 
legally obligated to your request? 
The Journal-Gazelle calls me 
aboul every six weeks, asking me 
if I would like lo receive ihe 
Sunday paper. Every time, I men- 
tion to them that I already receive 
the Sunday paper. Don'l Ihey have 
a list? 

Why is it thai ihe Jazz &amp; 
Blues Club, downtown, across 
from Columbia Street, doesn't lei 
people under ihe age of 26 in after 
9 p.m.? I'm over 26, and a policy 



like that.. .well, I'll never go inside 
thai place, nor will any of my 
friends. Take note owners, you arc 
actually losing business. 

Do you ever wonder how 
McDonald's stays in business? 
Have you ever had good service 
of half-way decent food al a local 
MacShack? I don'l appreciate the 
long lines and rude managers that 
operale ANY of Fort Wayne's 
local franchises. If you want a 
good burger, no frills or scream- 
ing kids, do like the commercials, 
bead lo Rally's. 

Why is good service so hard 
to Find in this town? How can ihe 
"City of Churches" have so many 
insensitive people and why do 
they have lo work al all the stores 
I patronize? Try Lowe's, a million 
employees and none will even 
make eye contact. For all of your 
hardware needs, I suggest any of 
ibe three True Values located in 
Fort Wayne. Customer service 
still remains as the number one 
priority, go in once and you'll 
noiicc what I mean 

Are speed limit signs in Fort 
Wayne just a suggestion? 
Everyone speeds, but I never see 
"speed traps" on Coliseum. This 
is the most unsafe road in the City. 
I would like to blame the 16-22 
year old crowd for this one. You 
guys are the worsi. 

Have fun when you have to 
finally pay for your own insur- 
ance. You'll see how bad driving 
affects your premiums. I seem bit- 
ter, but I drive in this town every- 
day, Ii is bad. 

Is it me or does local radio 
keep gelling worse? The "Edge." I 
think that's what they call them- 
selves, plays about 15 songs a day, 
in heavy rotation. I also think 
there are waaaay loo many 
female/folk/"mcn have treated me 
bad' Vo vena led/ singers out there. 



Fiona Apple needs to just have a 
hamburger and relax, and Jewel 
hpsyncbed the national anihem at 
the Super Bowl, 

If I hear "Jerry Springer" one 
more lime, my head will explode. 
No wonder this country is going 
to hell in a handbaskei (I sound 
like my parents). Warn to waich a 
good talk show? Oh yeah, there 
aren't any. I realize the entertain- 
ment value, but what is worse, 
being on the show or wasting an 
hour of your life watching ii? 
Think about lhat. 

I'd like mention lhat the Fort 
Wayne Wizard's baseball season 
has started. The stadium, also 
know as "The Casde," hosts about 
70 games through September. It's 
about six bucks to get in and you 
can enjoy some preliy good pro- 
fessional baseball. Clean, safe, 
friendly and not a bad scat in the 
house There is more lo ihis town 
than (he Komels and Fury, no 
offense lo ihem. Have a beer, 
enjoy those cool summer nights 
and see some future stars. 

I saw "Volcano" on cable ihe 
other night. Yawn. Good special 
effects, terrible dialogue Ellen 
DeGenercs's girlfriend is in the 
movie. I thought she was terrible. 

Seen "Titanic" yet? Good 
movie, nol excellent, bul il was 
and su'U is, a tragic siory. In case 
you haven't seen it, ihe boat sinks. 
(Yes, that joke is about four 
months old, and no, it isn't funny.) 

Well, lhai's all for ihis week, 
kudos again to the Campus Cops, 
we appreciate Ihe hard work 

LOSER OF THE WEEK: The 
weather I wish il would either be 
nice or nasty, not different every- 
day. Pretty soon we'll all be com- 
plaining about the mosquitoes and 
how damn hot il is. God, I love 
Hoosiers, ihe worst weaiher in the 
country and nobody ever leaves!

Automotive industry 
helping out graduates 



By Kelly Bergman 
Features Editor 

There are ai leas) three things 
thai college graduates need when 
they leave the confines of college 
and head out to the real world: 3 
good resume, an interview suit and 
some wheels. 

To help you out with this some 
major car makers have made incen- 
tives for those heading out to the 
workplace. 

Both GMC and Ford Motor 
company offer similar offers. 

The Ford College Graduate 
program offers recent graduates a 
$400 cash bonus on the purchase or 
lease of any eligible Ford or 
Mercury car, mini van, pickup or 
sports utility vehicle. 

More then 32,000 students look 
advantage of the program last year. 

"Our goal is to build long-term 
relationships and loyaJty," said 
Ross Roberts, Ford Motor 
Company vice president and gener- 
al manager, Ford Division. 



The eligible vehicles that apply 
to this program are selected by most 
younger customers to be the most 
popular. 

Some of them include the 
Escort 7X2, Mustang, Contour, 
Explorer and Ranger. 

They are among the highest 
scoring Ford vehicles in the terms 
of owner loyalty. 

These vehicles account for 
more than 60 percent of College 
Graduate Program purchases. 

Students that nave graduated or 
will graduate from an accredited 
institution including four-year col- 
leges, junior colleges, community 
colleges, nursing schools and trade 
schools, between October 1, 1996, 
and January 5, 1999, arc eligible to 
apply for die program. 

Students who are enrolled in 
graduate school are also eligible. 

By far the most popular vehicle 
among the graduates is the 
Mustang. 

Mustang sales have risen ever 
since the pony car was introduced 




to the world in 1964. 

Why are the 
Mustangs so hot? 

"It's a simple formu- 
la," said Ross Roberts. 
"For 1998. we offered 
the customer more 
Mustang for the money. 
the customer response 
was almost immediate, 
but the magnitude of the 
response was greater 
than we expected ." 

This response has 
caused many workers in 
their plants to work 
maximum overtime 
hours to accommodate 
for it. 

Some of the new 

enhancements for the 1998 Ford Mustang GT 

1998 Mustangs are just 
adding items to the regular standard 
package instead of having the new 
car buyers pay extra for them. 

Some of the new features 
include air conditioning, AM/FM 
car stereo with CD player and cas- 



sette player, power windows and 
door locks, remote keyless entry 
system and polished 15-inch alu- 
minum wheels. 

The GT models have a few 
extra added features from the stan- 
dard version. They include a power 



driver's seat, fog lamps, rear spoil- 
er, leather wrapped steering wheel 
and cast aluminum 16-incb wheels. 
Even though these two versions 
of (he Mustang series have added 
features to them, the price has gone 
down rather than gone up. The V-6 



coupe has gone down in price by 
about $1300 and the V-6 convert- 
ible has gone down almost $1700. 

Some of you just might be able 
to graduate to a new car after col- 
lege with deals like these. 



Industrial Joe's presents a comfortable environment for all 



By (Catherine Mbchsner 
Staff Writer 



Industrial Joe's is a mirage of 
culture in a local coffeehouse with 
an industrial theme, 

The gears you see on the 
walls as you walk in sym- 
bolize a world full of 
busy and uneasy souls 
needing a break from 
mainstream American 
society 

Everyone is wel- 
come to make their 
mark at Industrial 
Joe's, indicated by the 
signatures . that cover 
the walls. 

The'walls 

are the inspira- 
tions of those 
wbo come to Joe's and are a sign of 
their involvement in the business. 
"Industrial Joe's provides a 
relaxed environment for all people 
to achieve an experience of securi- 
ty away from friends and family," 
said Andrew Beacby. owner. 

"The barriers between all crea- 
tures' walks of life need to crum- 
ble." be said. 

Joe's is a place where discus- 
sions of religion, politics, pbiloso- 
; phy and poetry go on daily. 

Beachy said he wants to see 
those topics become catalysts for a 
new community of world-aware 
individuals seeking a world-aware 
community. He also would like to 
! see his coffeehouse bring people 
: closer together. 

"1 wanted to make a safe hang 
out for all people to come to." says 
Beacby. "1 like to talk to creative 
people about their lives. I also like 
learning about things outside my 
group of friends." 

The people that work at Joe's 
are from many walks and paths of 
life.

Acthletic cvicfi/isf 



By Tony Laux 

Sports Editor 



Tbe year is almost over for 
IPFW athletics and it is time to start 
looking at things thai need to be 
addressed for next year 

'Tin retention of Amle Ball 
and Butch Perchan must be 
a priority of the university: 
The Athletic Department isn't 
where it should be yet but these two 
men are what this school needs to 
be successful in athletics. 

•Monetary funding for the 
department needs to be 

increased: 

Lets face it, this department 
needs an increase in tbe budget. It 
is one of the few organizations that 
represent this campus to the other 
schools around the nation. 

There aren't really any other 
year-long activities that promote 
the campus with the possible 
exceptions of the Theatre Program 
and The Communicator. 

'■All home matches to be 
covered on the campus TV 
Channel 6: 

This campus needs to have 
exposure and what better way than 
using TV. 

IPFW athletes are as good as 
they come and they need to have as 
much chance to get exposure as 
possible. 

'■'Continued academic sue- 
cess of the IPFW athletes: 

Most people may not realize 
this but to participate in athletics 
you need to maintain at least a 2,0 
GPA and most athletes score well 
over this. 



The department keeps statistics 
on which team does belter when 
grades come out and most coaches 
have to be pleased witb the results 
of their players. 

\ hard look at adding 
more sports to this school: 

This school has 11 NCAA var- 
sity sports and there is always room 
for more. 

Womens soccer is on its way 
but football and golf would be nice. 

*A better coordination 
between events that SAB 
puts on and home athletic 
events: 

It is hard to get people on this 
campus to do things and maybe it 
would be better to coordinate 
smaller events with athletic event. 

For example, when SAB puts 
on their casino night they should 
have it before a game and give out 
the prizes between games. It might 
increase attendance at both events 
if they are on the same day. 

♦Better athlete recognition 
on campus: 

Maybe letter jackets aren't the best 
answer but something needs to be 
done so that the teams could be rec- 
ognized. 

'■Creek organizations regu- 
lar attendance at athletic 
events: 

They should be in the stands 
every night to show their support 
for this school, but most people 
would settle for a couple of nights. 



Baseball closing 
in on school record 



By Tony Laux 
Sports Editor 



The mens baseball team is hit- 
ting on all cylinders. They have 
won five straight games and have 
moved themselves into third place 
in the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference North Division. 

The team started the streak by 
crushing Indiana Wesleyan 
University 17-3 on the road. 

The Dons spent this weekend 
showing Wisconsin-Parkside why 
they are in last place in the division. 
The team won four straight over the 
weekend by winning Saturday 3-0 
in game one and 9-6 in game two. 
Not to be outdone the Dons crushed 
Parkside 9-3 and 19-6 on Sunday. 

Dan Matbews, Jim 
McCulIough, Mike Scroggs and 
Shawn Bloom all won this weekend 
for the Dons. 

Jason Jaffe has continued to be 
the hot man for the team. He is in 
the top ten of several offensive cat- 
egories for the GLVC. 

With these wins the i^m has 
crept within four games of the 
school record for wins. The team 
has sixteen games left to win two 
more to break the record. 

Seven more wins are needed for 



Tony Vittorio to reach his 200th 
career win.

Brad Smock .351

Pepband needed on campus 



By Amy Roberts 
Sports Reporter 

The IPFW athletic events are a 
puzzle with a missing piece. The 
songs of a pep band which rally the 
crowd and athletes would complete 
ibis puzzle. 

Talking to Butch Perchan, 
IPFW's athletic director. 1 found 
out that a student in the music pro- 
gram formed the first IPFW pep 
band in the spring of 1994. Doug 
Hassell, a senior who plays lead 
trumpet in the Jazz Band at IPFW, 
led the first pep band. 

Some of its major supporters 
included Perchan and Steven 
Sarratorre, an interim music 
department chair in 1994. 

The first pep band consisted of 
three trumpets, three trombones, a 
drummer and a bass player. And 
its leader had to find all music on 
bis own, since it was not provided 
by IPFW. 

The pep band performed at 
most volleyball home games over 
the two years of its existence. 
Unfortunately, the pep band was 



^I^*i*T7j iHti*ivii 

somewhat disorganized. Not all of 
the members showed up regularly, 
even though members were 
informed of all game performance 
dates and limes. If the band bad 
more members, these problems 
could have been avoided. 

After two years, due to lack of 
communication on both sides, the 
pep band dissolved. Hassell added 
that be felt be received inadequate 
support from the athletic depart- 
ment. 

Perchan and Sarratorre unsuc- 
cessfully tried to encourage other 
students to lake over the pep band 
The only qualifications necessary 
to lead the pep band are interest, 
knowledge of how to play an 
instrument and some time. But, 
students felt they were underpaid 
for the amount of time they put into 
the band. Also the music depart- 
ment offered no credits for a pep 
band, nor did any of its staff help to 
sponsor it 

Despite these problems, IPFW 
valued its pep band. It even tried 
to pay high schools S100 for them 
to send (heir students to play at the 



w 



ann 



tTT&gt;?m 5TT?!jj 



home games. Due to the multiple 
conflicts with the high schools' 
own events, these students were 
also forced to quit the IPFW pep 
band. 

My solution is to restart a larg- 
er pep band. Athletics could pro- 
vide the band members free con- 
cessions and pay its members per 
game. This would exhibit the ath- 
leiic departments appreciation for 
the band and encourage the band 
members to be committed to the 
pep band and athletics. IPFW 
should also provide the pep band 
with music. 

Sanatorre suggested that the 
pep band be made an official 
ensemble, and offer it for credit. 
This would encourage students 
who join the pep band to stay in it, 
and would help recruit more mem- 
bers. 

This is a good idea, but I don't 
believe it is necessary to offer cred- 
it for being in the pep band. Hasell 
agrees that most students don't 
need extra credit for band. 

The most important improve- 
ment would be to have the support 



of the athletic department This 
includes letting the pep band have 
the home game schedule well in 
advance, and letting its members 
know how long they will be 
expected to perform at games. 

Hassell thinks that the athletics 
should also support the music 
department by coming to music 
concerts. He thinks that if the ath- 
letics wants the pep band to come 
and support them, they should do 
the same thing for tbe music 
department, 

I think (hat the head of the 
music department should also help 
decide what actions need to be 
taken to determine the solution to 
this problem. 

A pep band is a great way for 
more excitement and support at 
sporting events. For example, 
Purdue's pep bands play an impor- 
tant role in charging up the crowd 
and athletes in Mackey Arena, just 
as IPFW's pep band did and can do 
again at the Gates Sports Center. 
After all, without a pep band, there 
is one less group of fans at the 
game cheering on the 'Dons. 



Flyers down Dons 



By Joan Pools en 
Sports Reporter 

The mens volleyball team 
closed out its season last Friday by 
losing to the Lewis Flyers in four 
games at the Midwestern 
Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association championships in Ball 
State. 

Victor Rivera, of Lewis 
University, showed all night why 
be was voted player of the year by 
the conference. He was simply 
unstoppable. IPFW tried to use 
three blockers against his powerful 
bitting but it seemed like every- 
thing the Dons tried couldn't stop 
him, 

This is not to say that the 
'Dons didn't keep trying. Hector 
Soto, Chris Gisslen and Javier 
Escobar helped keep the game 
interesting. Escobar's serving in 
the second match helped lead the 



'Dons but the Flyers seemed 
focused on stopping the hitting of 
Soto. Most times that Gisslen set 
him at tbe net he was facing two 
and three blockers on every 
attempt. 

Another high note for this 
match is all of the people from Fort 
Wayne who made the trip to Ball 
State. IPFW had the most fans 
there of all the schools involved 
and it showed when IPFW was 
playing. 

Even though this season is 
probably over the 'Dons have com- 
pleted a season that fans can be 
proud of The team fought through 
injuries that would have crippled 
other teams, and Arnie Ball 
showed us all why he is the wizard 
of volleyball. 

Unlike when the Cubs fans say 
wail until next year it means some- 
thing when we talk about IPFW 
volleyball.
