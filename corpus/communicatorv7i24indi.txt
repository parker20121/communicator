Both Tim 'Peterson, the Campus 
Minister and Maxine McKnlglit, 
the Worship Coordinator of the 
Metropolitan Community

Mike Schlatter's letter "Homo-

appeared last week. Their letters 
appear on page 2.

Dave Nichols spent some 
time downtown drinking in the 
atmosphere of the historic build-

some of these feelings as well as 
some descriptions of newer

Service suggestions sought 

A decision will be made in the near future having to do with who will serve 
IPFW its food for the next three years. 

Al present A.R.A holds the contract for the food operations in the Student 
Union Building, -ind Canteen services the vending machines on campus. 

The decision on which bid to accept will be made sometime between now and 
June 30. at which time the present contracts expire. According lo Don Katler, 
Purchasing Director, the decision will most likely be made by the Chancellor's 
cabinet Hatter stated that he certainly hoped there would be student inpul into the 
decision. Kalter stated that a number of bids had been received, and that some 
Interesting concepts concerning the food operation on campus were being 
considered, including some survey work to discover just what the persons on 
campus would like to see in types of service to be offered. 

It is general knowledge that the present food service is an unprofitable venture 
for A.R.A. Any numbe5 of reasons have been mentioned as to the reason (or the 
cafeteria losing money; the Student Union Building is too isolated, the hours of 
operlion are wrong, this campus is not compa table to a fast-food Operation, etc, etc. 

We disagree None of the reasons given hit the nail on the head; the present 
operation simply doesn't offer the quality in its fast -food-service necessary to 
convince persons on campus to take ad vantage of eating here Thai is why we have 
fast-food operations all around the perimeter ol the campus There niusl he enough 
business In the area, there are certainly enough competitors seeking campus 
support from A to Z (Azars to Zolis). 

If you have suggestions as to what type of service ought to be available, a letter 
tother'dilor is a way lo express your views. Any new contract will probably run for 
the next three years; so now is the time to speak out.

Some individuals are looking for a god 
to judge them. Someone will always assume 
such a position for them. Perhaps you have 
the address of such a god?? It is a different 
matter to convince an individual of a loving

human sinscould really be forgiven by a 
loving God? Who can believe that 
repentance is so simple as giving Him our 
guilt? A great number of humans prefer to
