Otumble into any casino and the 
bombardment begins - a visual spec- 
tacle of a glamorous life waiting to hap- 
pen - a dream world where one coin 
or two chips can change your destiny. 
Since the gambling culture has shifted 
toward the Internet with over 1400 on- 
line casinos, the opportunity to win 
money has increased. 

When the lavish underbelly of pos- 
sibility and chance conveniently hides 
the facade of gambling, it is sometimes 
hard to see the truth behind it, and its 
destructive nature - one affecting the 
college student the most. 

Pathological gambling by definition 
a progressive disease that devastates 
ot only the gambler, but everyone 
th whom he or she has a significant 
elationship. 

White the nature of gambling maybe 
larmless, according to Michelle Smith, 
counselor at Suicide &amp; Gambling Pre- 
'ention, " the impulse to gamble can 
quickly accelerate.™ This acceleration 
brings on [he potential and higher risk 
for losing everything. 
Due to the problems associated with 
;ambling, three phases ot gambling 
have been noted to help with preven-

Options for you

By Doug Schmidt

Last month, the Re- 
cording Industry Asso- 
ciation of America won 
a lawsuit against a Min- 
nesota woman accused 
of illegally downloading 
two dozen songs. The 
court awarded the RIAA 
$220,000 in damages. 
It seems that, for those 
who get caught, "free" 
music costs over $9,000 a 

song. Fortunately, IPFW ^oupusa'comirwhar^e 
students do not have - 
to meet the same fate. 
There are a variety of 
ways to find free music 
■ inline without risking a 
lawsuit.

The biggest place to get 
these legal recordings is 
The Live Music Archive 
(http:// www. archive. 
org/details/etree). 
Look for free samples 
from record companies. 
While large record labels 
spend millions fighting 
piracy, some small la- 
bels use free tracks as a 
promotional tool. A few 
to try are And Records

Stay away from the

Across the country, 
affirmative action 

on the line 



ByTAMARABARTLETT 
U=W1RE 



More than a decade 
after California voters 
passed Proposition 209 
to prohibit affirmative 
action in college admis- 
sions, five other states 
may consider similar 
bans for their public in- 
stitutions, prompting 
some to worry about 
maintaining diversity in 
higher education. 

Petitions ate currently 
being circulated in Arizo- 
na, Colorado, Missouri, 
Nebraska and Oklahoma 
to put affirmative action 
bans on the November 
2008 ballot. 

The bans would pro- 
hibit the states from 
discriminating against 
or granting preferential 
treatment based on race, 
sex or ethnicity, among 
other factors, in public 
employment, education 
and contracting. 

Ward Connerly, chair- 
man a( [he American 
Civil Rights Institute and 
a former University of 
California regent influ- 
ential in implementing 
Proposition 209, helped 
propose the initiatives 
planned for the five 
states. He said the bans 
would help to redirect the 
public's attention back to 
educational issues and 
away from race. 
"Once the consideration 
of race is eliminated, my 
own belief is that then we 
will focus on study habits 
and why Asians are out- 
performing blacks, Lati- 
nos, outperforming ev- 
erybody," he said. 

But some others said 
discounting race in the 
admissions process will 
limit the range of cultural 
experiences represented 
on college campuses. 

"It's going to get to the 
point where diversity is 
a completely different 
thing than what it was 
before," said Associated 
Students of the Univer- 
sity of California Exter- 
nal Affairs Vice Presi- 
dent Danny Monies. "A 
lot of universities pride 
themselves on having 
a diverse population, 
but really how diverse 
is it when people's ex- 
periences ... (are) being 
banned form the admis- 
sions process?" 

After Proposition 209 
passed In 1996, simi- 
lar bans also passed in 
Washington in 1998 and 



in Michigan in 2006. 

According to UC ad- 
missions data, minority 
enrollment saw a slight 
decline for some eth- 
nicities after the Cali- 
fornia law passed. 

In fall 2005, 144 Amer- 
ican Indians enrolled 
as in-state freshmen 
across the university, 
down from 248 in 1995 
before the ban was en- 
acted. Also in fall 2005, 
909 African American 
students enrolled, down 
from 945 in 1995. 

Chi cano/ Latino and 
Asian-Filipino-Pacific 
Islanders saw an in- 
crease in enrollment af- 
ter the ban was passed, 
with 4,652 Chicano/La- 
tinos enrolled in 2005, 
up from 3.432 in 1995. 
Asian-Filipino-Pacific 
Islanders numbering 
12,254 enrolled in 2005, 
up from 7,910 a decade 
earlier. 

The use of affirma- 
tive action was also 
banned in faculty and 
staff employment after 
Proposition 209 passed 
but some said because 
faculty and staff were 
already underre pre- 
sented, the proposition 
had a relatively small 
impact. 

"The most dramatic 
impact was on student 
admissions," said Da- 
vid Montejano, associ- 
ate professor of ethnic 
studies at UC Berkeley. 
"Representation among 
the faculty and the ad- 
ministration has always 
been poor." 

While Connerly said 
the proposed bans in 
other states may have 
the same effects that 
Proposition 209 had in 
California, others said 
that because each re- 
gion is unique, it is too 
early to tell. 

"It's hard to predict 
whether Colorado will 
mirror those trends," 
said Ken McConnel- 
logue, a spokesperson 
for the University of 
Colorado at Boulder. 
"It's kind of a different 
story each place you 
look." 

Officials at Arizona 
State University said 
the Arizona initiative, 
if passed, would not 
change admissions and 
employment practices, 
as the school does not 
place preferences on 
applicants. 



Students hope site gets candidates 
to answer questions 



ByLARAlNEWESCHLER 

U-WIRE 



Voters who did not get 
their YouTube questions 
answered by presidential 
candidates have a new 
option, according to Ra- 
chel Tardiff, a freshman 
in the School of Commu- 
nication. 

Tardiff and a group of 
students.incl uding about 
15 from AU, created 
Straight2theCandidates. 
com, a Web site designed 
to encourage candidates 
to answer voters' most 
pressing questions. The 
Web site was launched 
in the beginning of Oc- 
tober. 

Users of the site can 
"speak out" by posting 
questions to specific 
candidates or "listening" 
by reading and voting for 
the questions they find 
most important. 

The site's administra- 
tors plan to send the 
first batch of questions 
via e-mail to campaign 
staff Nov. 4, according to 
Anna Cottone, a member 
of the site's press group 
and a freshman in SOC. 

There is no guarantee 
that the candidates will 
answer, but those in- 
volved with the project 



hope that enough people 
will ask questions to cre- 
ate a media buzz about 
the site, which will force 
the candidates to re- 
spond, Cottone said. 

The founders of a simi- 
lar German site, direk- 
tzu.de, presented the 
idea for a U.S. version of 
the Web site. 

Tardiff, nowpresident of 
Straight2theCandidates. 
com, jumped on the 
idea, meeting with the 
Germans who began the 
site, Alexander Puschldn 
and Caveh V. Zonooz, 
many times over two 
weeks. The Germans 
traveled to the United 
States to recruit students 
for the project, but AU 
students took the lead 
in getting the project off 
the ground. 

"[The Web site] was 
created just as a means 
for regular citizens to 
contact the officials in 
charge," said Alyssa Wo- 
lice, a freshman in SOC 
and a member of the 
Web team. "It's a way 
for them to voice their 
opinions and have their 
questions and concerns 
presented." 

Although the Ger- 
mans act as consul- 
tants for the American 
site, the student group 
is in control of the Web 
site, said Shannon Sul- 



livan, vice president of 
Straight2theCandidates. 
com and a freshman in 
the School of Interna- 
tional Service. 

The site is a win -win 
situation for both candi- 
dates and voters because 
it allows for democratic 
political dialogue, Cot- 
tone said. 

1 Unlike the CNN/You- 
Tube debates, in which 
voters posted video 
questions on YouTube. 
com that were then 
chosen by CNN for tele- 
vised debates, there is 
not a "middle man" on 
Straight2theCahdidates. 
com, Sullivan said. The 
Web team hopes to send 
the top three voted ques- 
tions each week to the 
candidates. 

Sen. Barack Obama, 
D-I1L has garnered the 
most questions so far, 
with 34 posted on the 
site. 

Student members 
across the country are 
working to promote the 
site on their campuses, 
and the team has a long 
list of media contacts to 
try to generate more in- 
terest, Cottone said. 

The team has handed 
out fliers at the anti-war 
protest, an Obama fund- 
raising event and at 
Georgetown and George 
Washington universities, 



Tardiff said. 

The team has been con- 
tacting tech and media 
representatives in all the 
candidates' campaigns 
to tell them about the 
project in hopes of get- 
ting a direct line to the 
candidates. They hope 
lesser-known candidates 
will respond to questions 
and the site's credibility 
will gain momentum as 
more people hear about 
it. 

"It seems like college 
students have the po- 
tential to create the most 
dynamic, interactive 
Web sites," said Hillary 
Blank, a senior in the 
College of Arts and Sci- 
ences, referencing sites 
like Facebook. 

Straight2theCandidates. 
com and other Web sites 
are the start of a revolu- 
tion in the relationship 
between candidates and 
the voters that they are 
courting, Blank said. 

Straight2theCandidates. 
com will be useful as 
long as the questions 
are answered, said Caleb 
Skeath. 

"[Internet outreach 
campaigns] won't turn 
the election one way or 
another, but it will be a 
factor," he said.

From Page 1 



The Winning Phase is the 
period of gambling where 
one is having fun, the 
sense of excitement is still 
prevalent, more money is 
being bet, ego is boosted, 
and before the person 
knows it, they are betting 
everything. The psycho- 
logical down fail begins 
with an unrealistic opti- 
mism being developed, 
leading rapidly to the sec- 
ond phase. 

Synda Clements, a nurs- 
ing student at 1PFW notes 
a friend who has the po- 
tential for problems. "My 
friend plays online poker 
everyday - that's how he 
makes money during 
school." While there is 
strategy to playing these 
online games, an addic- 
tion can turn a winning 
streak sour. 

The losing phase consists 
of the gambler losing big, 
bragging about past wins, 
begging, borrowing, steal- 
ing to gamble, gambling 
alone, lying to family and 
friends, and begin feeling 
moody, grumpy, and with- 



drawn. 

Desperation soon set- 
tles and the gambler be- 
comes obsessed, starts 
blaming others, 
and contin- 
ues to lie, 
cheat, and 
steal. The 
gambler by 
this point 
could com- 
mit illegal 
acts to get 
money, alienate 
others, and increase 
drug and alcohol use. Be- 
cause the mental severity, 
the gambler could reach 
an emotional breakdown 
and a feeling of hopeless- 
ness can lead to suicidal 
thoughts and attempts. 

According to a study 
of gambling and col- 
lege students done by 
the Gambling Problem 
Resource Center at the 
Minnesota Institute of 
Public Health, the col- 
lege years may represent 
a heightened risk for de- 
veloping gambling prob- 
lems because this period 
is associated with a wide 



range of at-risk behav- 
iors, including heavy use 
of alcohol, and the legal 
age of gambling is 18 in 
many states. 

"Gambling 
is another 
form of 




stated Smith, i 
The association with ' 
gaming allows gam- 
bling to become a norm 
among the college stu- 
dents, which represent 
5.1 percent of patho- 
logical gamblers in the 
United States. According 
to research at the Uni- 
versity of Washington, at 
least 15 percent of col- 
lege students are at risk 
for developing gambling 



problems. 

While not all students 
become problem gam- 
blers, the risk is notable 
high. Indiana is the sec- 
ond largest gambling 
revenue contributor in 
the U.S. This statistic is 
in correlation to Indiana 
having the highest bank- 
ruptcy and repossession 
in the U.S. The majority 
of lottery winners also 
end up going bankrupt.

Broadway Lights Dimmed 

The marquees may be dark, but Broadway has never had more drama. 



By Laura Hedli 

U-W1RE 

Three angry middle- 
aged women stood out- 
side "Chicago's" Ambas- 
sador Theatre Saturday 
night where curtains 
were scheduled to go up 
on Grammy-nominated 
Brian McKnight as law- 
yer Billy Flynn. Hailing 
from Ohio, the theater 
lovers had spent thou- 
sands on airfare and ho- 
tel rooms. They had tick- 
ets to see five Broadway 
shows in one weekend. 
But because of the Lo- 
cal One stagehand strike, 
they would only be see- 
ing one. 

"I sympathize with 
what they're doing, but 
it sucks to be me." said 
Laura, one of the three, a 
high school teacher who 
had taken off time from 
her job to come to New 
York. 

At 11 a.m. on Satur- 
day, Nov. 10, Local One, 
a 3000-member stage- 
hand union, declared a 
strike on the League of 
American Theatres and 
Producers. Their actions 
were sanctioned by In- 
ternational President 
Thomas C. Short of the 
International Alliance of 
Theatrical Stage Employ- 
ees (IATSE). 

"Dr. Seuss' How the 
Grinch Stole Christmas! 
The Musical" was the 
first show to be affected. 
Gearing up for the holi- 
day season and cater- 
ing to family theatergo- 
e r s , the musical 



had its first performance 
scheduled for 1 1 a.m. But 
by the time matinee au- 
diences were gathering 
in midtown, only seven 
Broadway theater houses 
remained open. 

"It's hard to tell little 5- 
year-old girls they won't 
be going to see 'Wicked' 
today," said an employ- 
ee at the Gershwin who 
wished to remain anony-' 
mous. "A lot of them start 
to cry." 

Disputes between Lo- 
cal One and the League 
have been ongoing since 
late July, but according 
to a statement posted on 
IATSE's official Web site, 
tensions mounted when 
IATSE President Short 
was forced to leave the 
table this past Thursday 
due to issues involving 
the Writers Guild strike. 
He said that because 
employers of the League 
were unwilling to com- 
promise with members 
of the Local One Union's 
bargaining team upon 
his departure, he had no 
choice but to authorize 
the hold. 

Outside each empty 
theater Saturday night 
stood a dozen or more 
Local One picketers with 
signs that read "Our Fam- 
ilies Are Number One." 
This marks the first strike 
in the Union's 125-year 
history. Forbidden by IA- 
TSE to provide any expla- 
nation, they could only 
offer colored 
flyen 



that outlined their argu- 
ments, citing producers' 
demandsfora39-percent 
cut in jobs and wages as 
the underlying cause, 
lust steps away (torn the 
picketers, managers and 
workers employed by 
League theaters handed 
patrons a different type 
of flyer — one that read 
"The Facts about the 
Stagehands' Strike." The 
League, it reads, claims 
to uphold a 3.5-percent

can't take their stuff out 
and tour. We are all es- 
sentially frozen." 

But it doesn't bode well 
for band members of 
Duran Duran, whose in- 
struments remain inside 
the Barrymore Theatre 
indefinitely. Dana Lios 
and Ml Reiss from New 
Jersey were "devastated" 
to hear that the popular 
'80s band wouldn't be 
playing Saturday night, 



"Because stagehands can't 
go into the theater, they can't 
take their stuff out and tour. 
We are all essentially frozen." 



wage increase each year 
for five years in addition 
to other bonuses, but it 
wants to eliminate what 
it see as "featherbed- 
ding," which involves the 
i overruling and overpay- 
ing of workers. 

One worker, who wi sh e d 
to remain anonymous, 
said that the League was 
fighting against Local 
One's "antiquated work 
issues," and the flyer cites 
many examples of stage- 
hands receiving large 
lump sums for doing lit- 
tle-to-no work. Standing 
outside the locked the- 
ater, he said, "Because 
stagehands can't 



one of 10 concerts in the 
group's limited engage- 
ment series. 

"We both have little 
babies that we left with 
babysitters tonight, and 
we came out as faithful 
fans," said Reiss. 

"I'm really shocked," 
said Lios, "I've been lis- 
tening since the eighth 
grade, and I really wanted 
to hear 'The Reflex' and 
'Save a Prayer' tonight." 

Troubled ticket-hold- 
ers concerned about 
ways to obtain refunds 
were met by employees 
who provided handouts 
with Ticketmaster and 
Tele charge infor- 



"We only have the in- 
formation for tickets pur- 
chased through Ticket- 
master in our box office," 
said the Gershwin em- 
ployee. "If you buy your 
tickets from a broker, we 
can't do anything about 
that." She explained that 
it was at the discretion of 
the brokers if they would 
refund a patron's money. 
Other theater employees, 
such as those outside the 
"Avenue Q" box office, 
were offering a list of en- 
tertainment alternatives

forms at the Circle in the 
Square, an independent 
theater, and its stage- 
hands are on a separate 
contract. "Xanadu" also 
played to two sold-out 
houses on Saturday. 

"They took a long time 
to go on strike, and I've 
heard people say that 
it's going to last just one 
week. But just imagine 
all the money they're 
losing," said one anony- 
mous 'Xanadu' promot- 
er standing outside the 
TKTS booth. 

An online statement 
released by Charlotte St. 
Martin, executive direc- 
tor for the League, says 
t h a r the strike will 



cost the industry $17 mil- 
lion a day. 

But the actors are still 
in attendance. Just min- 
utes before evening show 
times, actors and ac- 
tresses gathered outside 
their respective theaters 
in solidarity. Stephen 
Buntrock, who plays 
Teen Angel in the new 
Grease revival, stood 
at the Brooks Atkinson 
Theatre as a member of 
Actors' Equity, an entity 
that supports the Local 
One Union. It too had a 
flyer detailing its stance 
on the issue. 

"This flyer was writ- 
ten this afternoon, and 
I believe everything it 
says," said Buntrock. 
"We're here to support 
Local One. It's unani- 
mous across the board 
— there's a lot of unity 
out here." 

"Honestly, as an actor, 
I'm really new to these 
types of things," said 
2007 Tony-winner John 
Gallagher Jr. of "Spring 
Awakening" ashechatted 
with fellow cast members 
while strumming chords 
on his ukulele."' 

"I don't think you'll see 
any of us crossing picket 
lines a) by choice and 
bl even if we were to do 
so, there'd be no point. 
Plus, it's kind of fun." he 
added, smiling, "It's like a 
snow day."

SouljaBoy: 



Worse than global waiming 
Twice as annoying, 



Courtesy of U-WIRE drops lo zero. 

The only way for such an artist to stay 

successful is to write more hit singles 

that come with dances. Unfortunately 

PITTSBURGH — I sat at my com- for SouljaBoy, the quality of his current 

puter for a solid half-hour, trying to dance hints that any subsequent danc- 

think of a witty, yet still caustic way to es will be about as interesting as sitting 

say this, but I just can't come up with on a couch or lying down. His "Crank 

anything. So here goes: Soulja Boy is That" dance makes drunk people look 

terrible. Awful. Maybe the worst thing drunker and awkward people more 

to happen in hip-hop since Notorious awkward, causing many to fall over and 

B.I.G. died. And that was a decade ago. hurt themselves on a sharp object near- 

Now before you call me an indie-rock by. Who's ready for a lawsuit? 

snob, let's explore why it is that I might 

be so perturbed by this bad little boy. 4. Comes Comple\ 

With that, I present to you The Top sponding "Soulja Girl' 
Seven Reasons Why 



Soulja Boy is Worse 
Than Global Warm- 
ing and Twice as An- 
noying. Let us begin. 

6. Name Confu- 
sion and Shame- 
less Self-Promotion 

- Soulja Boy is also 



"The lyrics of 'Crank That' 
are the rap equivalent of 
the dialogue in an episode 
of'Beavis and Butthead."' 



with Cor re - 
— Soulja Boy 
wasn't satisfied 
with only one 
Soulja-related 
song, and we 
all know that 
he isn't at all 
sexist, so the 
album also fea- 
tures the tune 
"Soulja Girl." 



known as Soulja BoyTell'em. His album This tune, just released as the next sin- 



gle, is a smooth, love ballad, and actu- 
ally doesn't suck that bad. That is, until 
the chorus, when Soulja Boy chimes in 
with the same "YOUUUUUUU" chant 
that plagues "Crank That." Yup, Mr. Boy 
wrote two songs using the same chorus. 
He's a creative one, that Soulja. About as 



is called Souljaboytellem.com, which is 
also the address of his Web site. Now, 
this extended name would imply that 
Mr. Boy, whose real name is DeAndre 
Way, is being instructed to tell us some- 
thing, as in, "Hey Soulja Boy, tell 'em 
about your hot new album called Soul- 
jab oyteUem.com." But, no, that's just creative as a coma patient. 
his name. 

Thankfully, in case any of us were 3. Lyrical Content — Now we get to 

confused*, Mr. Boy repeals some incar- thereal meat of my argument. The lyrics 
nation of his name no less than 46 times of "Crank That" are the rap equivalent 
in the course of his hit song, "Crank of the dialogue in an episode of 'Beavis 
That (Soulja Boy)." He also includes his and Butthead." That is to say, they are 
name in the song's title for those of us utterly and unequivocally stupid. But at 
who are deaf and can only read track 
listings. What a gentleman. * &lt;~% ^^ ^^ 



5. Special Dance Equals Career Death 
— If Soulja Boy wishes his career to be 
long and illustrious, it's a shame, be- 
cause by creating a dance to go with his 
hit single, he has effectively slaughtered 



least Beavis and ^W ^ 

Butthead were funny. f 

Lines like, "Nope you can't 

do it like me/ So don't do it lik e me/ 
I seen you tryin' to do it like me/ Man, 



this possibility. Remember the guys that dance was ugly," sound like either 

who wrote "Macarena?" How about a drunken catfight at a fiat house or a 

"The Electric Slide?" Exactly. By bas- second grade playground taunt, 
ing the first hit song — the foundation Either way, to glean any meaning 

of a commercial artist's career — on an from Soulja Boy's lyrics will have the 

instructional dance, any chance that same result as listening to Nickelback 

people will view said artist as legitimate — you'll just end up with a headache. 



There are two lines, however, that have 
garnered a certain amount of special 
attention, leading us to ... 

2. Blatant Misogyny — Soulja Boy, 
like many rappers of his breed, 
loves the ladies. Or rather, being gross- 
ly sexist and disgusting towards them. 
Now I haven't conducted any solid re- 
search, but I'm reasonably sure that 
the majority of women out there would 
prefer not to be "super-soaked" or "Su- 
permanned." Honestly, I'd be less dis- 
gusted with Soulja Boy if he wrote a 
song about having a water gun fight 
with himself — at least no one would 
be degraded. And on that note ... 

1, Soulja Boy Has Ruined My Child- 
hood — Like many of you reading this, 
Super Soakers were about the coolest 
thing to own anywhere from third un- 
til sixth grade. The bigger Super Soak- 
er you had, the cooler you were, and 
water fights could rage all over any 
neighborhood. 

Thanks to "Crank That," I can no 
longer think of these wonderful child 
hood memories without the notion ol 
Soulja Boy super-soaking his favor- 
ite "Hooooooo." Thank you, Soulja 
Boy. Really. It's a much more pleas- 
ant image. 

So there you have it, The Top 
Seven Reasons Why Soulja Boy is 
Worse Than Global Warming and 
Twice as Annoying. Keep in mind 
that these are only the top seven 
— a veritable encyclopedia of 
other reasons is currently in ex- 
istence, including "Soulja Boy is 
Everything That is Wrong 



With ^^ 

Music To- 
day" and 
"Wearing Sunglasses 
With Your Name on the 
Lenses is Not Cool." 

In conclusion, "Crank That (Soulja 



Boy)" by Soulja 
Boy, AKA Soul- 
ja Boy Tell'em 
is the first sin- 
gle on Soul- 
jaboytellem. 
com. And it 
sucks.

It's time for angat-filled teenagers ev- 
erywhere lo rejoice. The Spill Canvas has 
a new record qui. 

Even the title, "No Really, I'm Fine" 
brings mental images of jaded and love- 
siruck youth to the forefront. 

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the 
musicianship on this record has received 
■ i in. iji n jumps tart and travels far beyond 
that of the typical alternative-rock band 
in an overcrowded, cookie-cutter indus- 
try. 

Formed in 2002 in Sioux Falls, South 
Dakota, The Spill Canvas was the early 
brainchild of frantman Nick Thomas, 
who first used the artsy moniker to be- 
gin writing and recording at the age of 
15. Since that time, he has put together 
a full band, shuffled the lineup several 
times, released four records and toured 
extensively. 

The current incarnation of the band 
features Nick Thomas (lead vocals, and 
guitar), |oe Beck (drums), Dan Ludcman 
(guitar) and London Heil (bass), and 



with "No Really, I'm Fine," this lineup has 
crafted a well-rounded and solid entry into 
the Warped Tour territory. 

The songs are short, catchy and mostly 
upbeat sounding without becoming overly 
pop-oriented. The guitar work in particu- 
lar is worth a special mention. Thomas and 
Ludcman are un-afraid to make their in- 
struments take the lead and sing their own 
melody. This approach is complimentary 
to the verses and contributes to the form- 
ing of an individual sound for the band 
- and important thing when your contem- 
poraries are bands like Panic! At the Disco. 

Though interesting in its arrangement, 
"No Really, I'm Fine" may turn some off 
who feel like they have been through the 
angry relationship phases of their lives al- 
ready. Though some of the lyrical content 
consists of angst of a different sort, mostly 
political, angst is still the keyword, and 
without a truly high energy level, it some- 
times comes off as a wasted effort. 

Overall, "No Really, I'm Fine" is a sur- 
prisingly satisfying experience, even if a bit 
cliche. There is a lot of potential with this 
band to evolve into a true heavy hitter at 
some point down the road.

an earthy theme; it is simple yet ele-

centerpiece. 

John Clay's artwork is the artwork 
of our generation. His work is very 
idealistic and 
conceptually 
based, invit- 
ing the view- 
er to question 
their purpose 



The Kachmann Institute in down- 
town Ft. Wayne is now hosting an ex- 
hibition of work from iPFW's graduat- 
ing visual communications students. 
The Kachmann Institute itself is a 
work of art; the entire building en- 
courages relaxation and almost seems 
to open the mind with its spacious or w h "^ey 
interior. The art is varied, some of the are. Clay's 
artists used concepts to define their artwork is 
work while others almost seemed to mostly dim- 
present sales pitches or marketing ta j p rm t s _ a 
examples. All of the art is presented choice that 
well, with each exhibit greatly vary- was made

in concept and idealization as well as cause of the 
form. One was presented with gourds digital era 
and about gourds, while another was mat we i; ve

Brandon Geisel created a coffee 
experience for his exhibit, focusing 
around marketing for a coffee compa- 
ny, "Verve" and thegraphic design used 
in the marketing. The exhibit includ- 
ed Verve coffee mugs filled with coffee 
beans. 




Each capti- 
vates the viewer's 
interest in its own 
right. It is evident 
that these exhib- 
i .Its were painstak- 
ingly put togeth- 
er, and that we 
may expect great 
things from these 
student artists. 



"In my work, I illustrate 
the simplicity of childhood,

Clay. 

An interest- 
ing part of this 
exhibit is that 



tal next to business cards and plastic 
cups, encouraging the viewers to take 
part in the experience. 

Ryan Pape takes his exhibit to a

AmandaMcConnellcomposedher 
exhibit around gourd art. She began 
working with gourds as a medium a 
few years ago and the love of the art 
simply grew. 

"I think that the 
thing that I love most 
about gourds is that 
each vessel has to be 
approached in a dif- 
ferent way because 
every one is-unique. 
Even one color will 
be more vibrant on 
one gourd to the 
next," said McCon- 
nell. 

Her exhibit fea- 
tured not only very 
colorful and tex- 
tured gourds, but 
also information 
about gourd art. She 
discussed how it is 
done, what instru- 
ments are used and 

even included some folklore about different people. This concept is very

created a physi-

mediums to reinforce the concept. 

"My intent is to shoot forward, in-

ent elements of this sub-culture in 
his exhibit. 

"With the ability to quickly apply 
gradations of color and create areas 
of fine detail, airbrushing has become 
the predominant focus and outlet for 
my creativity." 

Lisa Schwaberow used both stain 
glass images and moving, animated 
kaleidoscopes in her exhibit. She 
uses a large television screen with a 
presentation that can be activated 
and viewed on it. This presentation 
is comprised of kaleidoscope images 
dissolving into themselves along with 
music. Schwaberow also has several 
prints hanging on one wall, which are 
stain glass images that she reworked 
into Rose Window Designs. These are 
beautiful images that are calming and 
inspiring. 

"The Kaleidoscope imagery has a 
life of its own and sometimes I feel 
like it is leading me, instead of it be- 
fee on a ing commanded by any genius I may 
pedes- have." 

Jill Weaver created a provocative 
presentation using Photoshop, Flash 
animation, digital photography and 
fine art. Her concept? "... to express 
my own personal feelings about the 
overwhelming nature of the media." 
Her presentation consists of two tele- 
vision screens with fixed pictures 
against a newspaper background and 
. a Flash anima-

on a separate 
screen. It begs 
the question of

said Pape. ' 

Andrew McMillen combined his 
passion for airbrushing wi th his inter-

the automotive and motorcycle in- 
dustry. He designed and illustrated 
several graphics that include diffcr-

and asks when 
too much is

voking and displays its concept well. 
Joe Leman displays his business 
identity at the gallery. He 
shows off both his web- 
site and his commitment 
to utilizing all that he 
has learned as a graphic 
design student to further 
his career. Expression 
through design of his we 
bsite and business is ap- 
plaudable. 

"1 strive to obtain the 
proper balance of form 
and functionality that 
will allow my work to 
be most true to its cor- 
responding purpose. 
In fact, I would be bold 
enough to say that my 
actions pledge their al- 
legiance to this truth 
before all the traditions 
of modern and ancient 
art. To say it simply: I love truth more 
than art and I love purpose more than 
beauty," said Leman.

lery is open on Saturdays from 12 to 
4 p.m. Admission is free. For more in-

Hunger Banquet Strikes Home with IPFW Students 



By ZACHAHV HOHNBACK 

homihOieipfw.edu 

Of the 49 least de- 
veloped countries in 
the world, 50 percent 
of the population of 
these countries is es- 
timated to live at or 
below the absolute 
poverty line of US $1 
per day. This is just 
one fact of many dis- 
tributed at the Hunger 



Banquet on Monday. 
Students were issued 
seating and the many 
tables in the Walb Stu- 
dent Union Ballroom 
were filled up with 
people. Scattered on 
each table were fact 
sheets, maps, and 
information regard- 
ing the poverty and 
the hunger situation 
everywhere in the 
world. There were sev- 
eral speakers and at 
each table 
there was 
a mod- 
erator of 
sorts who 
was there 
to lead 
the con- 
versation 
ask the 
difficult 




students. dents went up only 

The thing that to receive a meager

idea of such poverty rice and a cup of the

meal it- — 

self. One 

student from each 

table was given clean 

water in a nice glass 

with real silverware 

and ceramic plates. 

This student was 

served a salad with 

dressing, chicken with Three out 

gravy, potatoes and of the 10 

green beans. 

Three students at 

the table recieved a 

rice mixture and some 

simulated "dirty wa-

with chocolate. Fi- 
nally, the re-

end, only one out of 
the ten people at the 
table was eating well 
and to the 
standards 
that we are 
used to. 



Americans take 
granted. So many 
people in the U.S. 
don't think about how 
incredibly rich we are, 
compared to the ma- 
jority of the world. 
Most U.S. citizens are 
the "haves" while the 
majority of the world 
are the "have-nots." 
So many Americans 
don't think about the 
people of the world 
— some of whom may 
even be found within 
the U.S. - who are 
chronically hungry 



and have so little to 
look forward to. This 
exercise of dividing 
up the students per 
table showed them 
in a provocative way 
the difference that is 
there every day and 
Americans don't seem 
to notice. 

There is enough 
food in the world for 
no one to go hungry, 
and yet so many exist 
every day on the bare 
minimum and many 
on less than that. What 
will you do to help?

Food Facts 



The average American eats almost 5 IDS. OT fOOCJ each day. 
However, one and a half billion people survive on tWO Or 

three ounces of beans or a half-cup of rice a day. 

If you keep food in a refrigerator, your clothes in a closet, if 
you have a bed to sleep in and a roof over your head you are 

richer than 75% of the entire world population. 

More than 50% of the population of the least developed 
countries in the world are estimated to live ator below the 

u.s. absolute poverty line of one dollar a day.

Men's Basketball Drops Season Opener vs. Wisconsin 



Courtesy of 
IPFW Athletics 



The IPFW Mastodons 
men's basketball team 
opened the 2007-08 sea- 
son on Sunday night in 
Madison, Wisconsin, 
taking on the Wisconsin 
Badgers. IPFW gave UW 
all they could handle in 
the first half, but Wiscon- 
sin's size was too much to 
overcome in the second 
half, falling to the Bad- 



gers, 83-55. 

IPFW showed the sell- 
out crowd of 17,901 at 
the Kohl Center that they 
were ready to battle their 
Big Ten opponents from 
the outset. 

The Mastodons took 
an early 12-6 lead just 
five minutes in as senior 
forward Jaraun Burrows 
found a slashing senior 
forward DeWitt Scott for 
a lay-in. 

IPFW increased the 
lead to nine points on a 
3-pointer by freshman 



guard Ben Botts at the 
8:35 mark- In fact Botts 
drilled his first three 3- 
points attempts and the 
'Dons had Wisconsin in a 
world of trouble. 

On a Burrows' bucket 
in the paint, IPFW took 
its largest lead of the half 
at 27-16 with 8:01 re- 
maining. 

But, the Badgers used 
an 11-3 advantage in first 
half fouis and a number 
of trips to the charity 
stripe to whittle the IPFW 
lead to just two with 3:27

left in the period. 

In fact, Wisconsin 
went on a 20-5 run to re- 
take the lead by six at the 
break, 38-32. 

Early in the second half, 
Burrows used his speed 
to beat the Badgers up 
the floor on two succes- 
sive possessions to draw 
the 'Dons to within three 
at 42-39, but that is when 
Wisconsin's size became 
a factor. 

Senior forward Brian 
Butch began throwing 
his 6-11 frame around 
and started to get his op- 
portunities, and he made 
the best of them. 

Butch tipped in a shot 
at the 15:08 mark that 
pushed the Badger lead 
to nine (48-39). 

His jumper from about 
15-feet pushed that edge 
to 57-40, and a triple from 
sophomore guard Trevon 
Hughes gave the Badgers 
a 21-point edge and end- 
ed the 'Dons hopes of an 
upset. 

Hughes had a huge 
night forWisconsin, scor- 
inga game-high 25 points, 




dishing 
out five 

assists. 

Butch 
regis- 
tered a 
double- 
double 
with 24 
points 



bounds. 
The 
Mast- 
odons 
were led 
by Botts 
with 14 points on 5-6 
shooting. The freshman 
was 4-5 from behind the 
arc. 

Burrows was the only 
otherMastodon in double 
figures with 12 points. 

After starting the game 
shooting around the 42% 
mark, IPFW finished the 
night at 34.5% (19-55). 



Wisconsin picked up 
their shooting in the sec- 
ond half to finish at 49.2% 
(32-65). 

IPFW will return home 
to host Valpariaso on 
Thursday night in the 
2007-08 home opener. 
Game time is set for 7:00
