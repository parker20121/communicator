Closing 
guidelines 



By CIlRlS'nNA MERCER 
Stall Writer 

Along with the winter months comes 
snow, freezing rain, bitter cold 
weather, slick roads and school can- 
cellations. However, IPFW rarely 
doses due to weather conditions. 

"We make every attempt to be open 
if we can. ' said John Camaghl, vice 
chancellor of rinancial affairs "lilBin 



thcsehool," added Carnaghi. 

Several foclors arc considered when 
deciding whether or not to close the 
campus, said Carnaghi. Cantaghi 
finds out whether or not the buildings 
and grounds crew can clean up the 
parking lots and slay ahead of ae- 
cumulaUng anow. He considers what 
(he experts say about the weather. He 
also looks al what the public schools 
arcdcring. 

If the city delcares a slate of 
emergency. IPFW will close ta 
cooperate with the Clean up 
procedures by keeping IPF^ students

IPFW health club 
is practically free 



Kvcn though Ihc holidayn arc nver 
mnny peopk arc ilill left with happy 
rcmmden of Ui« festivities: boxes erf 
wrapping paper and bows, a closeifuUot 
new cluihts (some eighi s\ia too big or 
fivoiius tooimolli, a vengeful lurhey 
■till taking up room In the fridge/ and 
miiybc a tew extra pounds that he and 
hl8 fallening cronies pJaccd on some 
Klf-lndulg«il bodies. 

Well maybe thai last one Isn't exactly 
a happy reminder of the holidays, but For 
loU of people It's (he one that hangs 
u round the longejit. 

And so, armed with sweatshirts and 
deodorant ihcy go out to join the ma&amp;ses 
ul people In expensive health clubs to rid 
themselves of the post- hoi I day ftubber. 

What many of these people who attend 
IHKW apparently do not know Is the 
Mulllpurpose Building right here on 
tumpus provides all the facilities Ihey 
need to gel back Into shape. 

And the best pnrt is the use ol the fa- 
cilities has olrcady been paid for by the 
120 student service fees. A student ID is 
all one needs to take advantage of mosl 



of the facilities and equipment 

Terniis courts, an indoor running 
track, basketttall and volleyball courts, 
a weight room equipped with Nautilus. 
Universal and free weights are Just a 
few of the many facilities open to faculty 
and students. The only fee charged Is the 
very reasonable t3 an hour charge tor 
the use of the raquetliall courts. Com- 
pare that with (he high pnce of mem- 
Iwrship dues and hourly rates charged 
by some oi the racquet clubs around 
Fort Wayne. 

Why would any student Join an ex- 
pensive, crowded ond inconveniently 
located fitness club when they've got 
such a modem, well-equipped and very 
exclusive "health club" right on eam- 

Everyone who wants to shed unwanted 
pounds of fat, gain much-wanted pounds 
ofmuscic, or just look belter in a bathing 
suit by summer should definitely check 
out the Multipurpose Building's facilities 
before Ihcy run out and spend a lot of 
moneytQrwhatUicy'veaii|eady paid for.

Classes as usual

Pledge allegiance to inaugural souvenirs 



Why In Ihc world did we have school 
Monday? 

Sure, (he roads were, for (he most 
part, clear No huge drifts or snowfalls 
were snarling Iroffte. Yes. Ihc IPFW 
parking loU were even cleared, 

Uul Mondoy morning, the tem- 
perature hovered around a below zero. 
Schools all over the area, including Fort 
Wayni' Community Schools and several 
local colleges, closed because of the 
dangerously cold temperature. 

tPPW, however, opened as usual. 
Doesn't the administration understand 
cars don't like to start when It's so cold? 
Don't they remember IPFW is a com- 
muter campus where students depend on 
their curs to get them to class? Why then 
did IPKW hold classes? 

Apparently the administration doesn't 
understand nice, cozy garages aren't 
avoiloble for all sludenU to pull their 
cars Into. )Iow can it make sense then. 
tor u commuter campus to hold classes 
when cars all over the city won't start? 

Maybe the administration thinks 
education is so important that class 
should be held no matter what But is 
education scri'ed when nearly halt the 
students can'l make it to class because 
their ears won't stnit? 



I met 






professors feel compelled to keep lec- 
tures to a minimum so that absent 
students won't get too tar behind. Why 
hold class at all? 

And what about how ridiculous 
students must feel when, after 
struggling In the cold and risking 
Frostbite to get their cars started, they 
arrive at school only to find their 
professor was unable to get his car 
started. 

On top of all this, nearly half of IPF^V 
students live oulside Allen County. 
Listening to any radio report Monday 
morning should have told the ad- 
ministration many students from 
outlying areas not only had to fight the 
cold, but drifted roads as well. 

Looking over the parking lots Monday 
morning at 10 a.m., two Communicator 
editors noted alraut holt of the lots were 
empty. 

Surely the administration knows 
Monday was essentially a wasted day. 
Maybe they think it Iniiks good tor the 
university (o stay open during adverse 
weather conditions. What it does more is 
show Ju.it how lacking ol common sense 
our highly educated administrators are 
when it comes to understanding sub-zero 
temperatures keep many cars from 
running.
