groups were registered for 
the walk. 



The Indiana Commission 
for Higher Education today 
released a document that 
"can be a milestone in the 
development of a compre- 
hensive, people-centered 
plan fortheresponslblede- 
velopment of postsecond- 
ary education". 

The document Is In the 
form of a preliminary draft 
for public discussion. It 
was released by the Com- 
mission at a meeting in the 
offices of Indiana Vocation- 
al Technical College. Ind- 
ianapolis. 

The document Is in two vo- 
lumes. Volume I provides 
detailed data on the present 
state of higher education In 
Indiana. Volume II. which is 
In large part based on Vol- 
ume I, Includes a series of 
recommendations to which 
citizens are encouraged to 
react. 

Citizen suggestions will be 
Incorporated In a final draft 
which will be subject 
to Commission approval 
before It Is submitted to the 
General Assembly and 
Govenor in 1973, 

O.C. Carmichael Jr., 
Commission Chairman, and 
James B. Kessler, Com- 
missioner for Higher Ed- 
ucation, said the draft for 
public discussion released 
today treats alt of Indiana's 



resources for postsecond- 
ary education as a single 
system. They said the draft 
emphasizes the services 
the system can provide for 
the people of the state. In- 
cluded In the draft is a 
recommendation that ac- 
cess to the postsecondary 
education system be made 
available to every resi- 
dent of Indiana. 

In a statement, Carmi- 
chael, of South Bend, said, 
"Today we are releasing a 
preliminary draft of a doc- 
ument that focuses on the 
future of higher education 
In Indiana. The draft was 
the result of hundreds of 
hours of work by the Com- 
mission, its professional 
staff and experienced con- 
sultants. It was specifically 
designed tc stimulate the 
public discussion that will 
play a major role in the 
development of a final se. 
of recommendations. 

While the draft released 
today is preliminary. It 
nonetheless constitutes a 
very imponani step for the 
Commission and for Ind 
lana. Publication of thi^ 
draft for discussion can b^ 
milestone In the develop- 
ment of a comprehensive, 
people-centered plan for 
the responsible devel- 
opment of postsecondar&gt; ' 



Spiro T. Agnew visits Fort Wayne Tuesday 



Like one of the crowd 
of 300 pressing close to 
the airport fence stated, 
"It's not every day that 
the Vice-President of the 
United States come s to 
town." And, in the true 
political style accompany- 
ing any national campaign 
effort, the visitof the Vice- 
President tothecityof Fort 
Wayne was an occasionde- 
slgned to bring momentary 
madness to the downtown 
section. 

Everything was primed 
and planned, from the som- 
ber-visaged law enforce- 
ment officials scrutinizing 
the situation from atop the 
courthouse and the city- 
county building to the in- 
evitable red, white, and 
blue bunting bedecking the 
podium. All of the trap- 
pings and sights of a cam- 
paign were very much 
present also— the miles of 
TV cables and grinding 
machinery of the televised 
media, the throngs of eager . 



press dutifully jotting notes 
Into Bpiraled notebooks, the 
scores of political pleni- 
potentaries smiling over 
the masses like so many 
benevolent gods, theBowen 
and Bloom youth al- 
ternately applauding and 
cheering every other word 
spoken by the various GOP 
officials. 

Of course, the star at- 
traction of the afternoon, 
the Vice-President him- 
self, was full of all the 
verve and out-spoken man- 
nerisms attributed to him. 
Whether It was the "old 
Agnew" or the new, 
the majority of the crowd 
loved his style, "Isn't he 
WONDERFUL?" one mid- 
dle-aged woman beamed to 
no one in particular after 
the VP had mounted the 
podium. To loyal Agnew 
fans, he was wonderful. 
True, he seemed to have 
left hisformer, heatedrhe- 
torlc behind and adopted a 
_more restrained speech 



than that formerly charac- 
teristic of him, buthedidn't

come out with a few swings 
against George McGovern 
and the Democrats and to

sented by PreB, MIcheal Colchln, accepts the winner's 
trophy from IPU Librarian Ted Hunsberger, 

Master plan.., (Cont'd from p. 1) 



Kessler said, "The draft 
contains some fifty (50) re- 
commendations and every 
one of those recommenda- 
tions are Interrelated. The 
Commission looked at 
higher education as a sys- 
tem, not a set of Isolated 
Institutions. 

The draft for discussion 
also states the principle 
that access to the system of 
higher education should be 
available to all people In all 
parts of the State. The ob- 
jective Is the creation of a 
postsecondary educational 
program -that responds to 
the real needs of Indiana 
both as they exist and as 
they will exist tomorrow". 

Among the specific re- 
commendations Included In 
the draft fordiscusslon: 

All Institutions of higher 
education should make an 
effort to effect operating e- 
conomles without jeopard- 
izing educational quality. 
Cooperation among Insti- 
tutions should be Increased 
and more use should be 
made of contractual agree- 
ments for services. Sucha- 
greements can eliminate 
duplication of effort without 
lessening educational op- 
portunities. 

The first two years of a 
baccalaureate program 
should be available to cit- 
izens through public Insti- 
tutions Ineach of the State's 
fourteen (14) Planning and 
Development Regions. In 
each region, all institu- 
tions, both public and In- 
dependent should work to- 
gether to Increase the ef- 
ficiency and effectiveness 
of the educational delivery 
system. 

The state scholarship sys- 
tem should be expanded and 
the distribution of scholar- 
ship funds should be based 
on the financial need of the 
student. 

In determining this need, 
the tuition/fee cost of the 
Indiana institution chosen 
by the student should be 
considered. Included would 
be Institutions in both the 
public and Independent sec- 
tors. 

New graduate programs 
for the most part should be 
restricted to the home 
campuses of four ,{4) , unii . 



versltles. Ball State, Ind- 
iana State, Indiana and Pur- 
due. New undergraduate 
degree programs on re- 
glonally-o r 1 e n t e d col- 
lege and university cam- 
puses should be closely tied 
to community needs. 

The Boards of Trustees of 
Indiana University and Pur- 
due University should study 
the operations of their cam- 
puses In Northwest Indiana, 
Allen County and Marlon 
County. The study should 
lead to recommendations 
involving suchposelblUtles 
as the consolidation of 
supporting services, the 
elimination of duplicated 
academic programs, the 
transfer of complete re- 
sponsibility to e i t h e r Ind- 
iana or Purdue, creation of 
a completely separate In- 
stitution In one or more of 
the three locations or 
maintenance of the current 
pattern In one or more 
location. For Marion 
County, the study should 
consider all aspects of the 
governance of the health 
care educational programs 
at Indiana University- Pur- 
due University at Ihdiana- 
polls. 

— The ties between Indiana 
State University Evansville 
and Indiana State Univer- 
sity Terre Haute should be 
cut and an Interim board 
should be created to govern 
the Evansville campus for 
two years. The board 
should study community 
needs and then recommend 
how Chose needs can best 
be met. 

— The Indiana University 
extension center at Colum- 
bus should become a re- 
gional campus within the 
I.U. system. The Indiana 
University programs at 
Columbus, Kokomo, Rich- 
mond and Purdue programs 
at the North Cental Campus 
should be at the two-year, 
community college level. 
The Vincennes University 
extension center at Jasper 
should be eliminated. 
— Occupational education, 
a particular responsibility 
of Indiana Voctional Tech- 
nical College, should be 
more closely coordinated 
with academic education on 
,^^a ^^gion-by -region basis.

expected from a political 
rally? 

To complete the scene, 
ami - Agnew and Nixon 
hecklers contributed a few 
choruses of catcalls peri- 
odically as pro-McGovem 
banners vied with Agnew 
signs against the skyline. 
But no matter. The af- 
ternoon would've been 
lacking In an essential el- 
ement without them. Added 
to all the other hoopla, 
they served to reinforce 
the Impression that poli- 
tics can often appear to be 
nothing more than an e- 
laborately staged floor 
show. Oh well, at least 
nationally It only happens 
once every four years. 

Vets to 
receive credits 

Phillip A. Kennel, Assoc- 
iate Director of Admis- 
sions for I-PU, has announ- 
ced that veterans enrolled

Flexibilitv stressed 

III academic programs set 
national trends for universities 



In [he past, Midwestern 
universities In the United 
States often looked to their 
peers on the east and west 
coasts for leadership. 

Now the tables are tur- 
ning, according to Kenneth 
GroB Louis, associatedean 
of the Indiana University 
College of Arts and Sci- 
ences. 

For example, he said. 
Eastern schools frequent- 
ly ask I. U. about estab- 
lished programs, indi- 
cating their interest in 
starting similar ones. 

The I.U. FOCUS pro- 
gram is an example. 
FOCUS was initiated here 
In 1967 to draw attention 
to social Issues. That year 
there was an all-campus 
program called "FOCUS: 
The City." It was fol- 
lowed by programs on black 
America, the environment, 
and, this year, citizenship. 
This semester, FOCUS 
is sponsoring a course, 
1'Scudencs as Citizens and 
Citizens as Students," 
bringing to the campus 
promlnant state and nat- 
ional figures. 

As pan of this program, 
Indiana will host the Se- 
cond National Conference 
on Student Consumer Ac- 
tion next month. Speakers 
will Include Betty Furness, 
former,, coji^m^z. advisor 
to ■president Lyndon John- 
son, and Lee Richardson, 
director of consumer edu- 
cation in President Nixon's 
Office of Consumer Af- 
fairs. 

Indiana University has 
taken a leading role 
in adapting and Incorpor- 
ating into a large univer- 
sity programs previously 
tried only in much small- 
er schools, Gros Louis 
said. Many of these are 
designed to allow more 
flexibility in undergraduate 
teaching and curriculum. 
They are more easily 
included at smaller schools 
which have smaller facul- 
ties and smaller student- 
faculty ratios, Gros Louis 
■explained. It is fairly- 
easy at a small college, 
where the faculty all know 
each other, to design an 
Interdisciplinary course 
which will be taught by a 
team of teachers, Gros 
Louis said. 

At a larger university, 
faculty members do not al- 
ways know their colleagues 
in other fields. This makes 
planning and cooperation 
more difficult. 

It is also easier for a 
teacher who has only a 
few students to take on the 
job of individual tutoring 
and instruction. 

But Gros Louis and others 
at I.U. areconvlnced — and 
are demonstrating — that 
bigness does not make such 
programs impossible. 

An example of flexibil- 
ity In curriculum now well 
esrabllshed at I.U. is the 
foreign culture option. 
Since the fall of 1969, stu- 
dents in the College of 



Arts and Sciences have 
been able to substitute for- 
eign culture courses for 
the traditional foreign lan- 
guage requirement. 

This option has inspired 
interdisciplinary team 

teaching, and has led to 
the initiation of new 
courses In areas like Af- 
rican studies. 

The change In the re- 
quirement has. In some 
cases, actually r esul ted In 
Increased enrollment In^ 
foreign language courses. 
Enrollment in Latin, for 
example, has risen as stu- 
dents have taken the cul- 
ture option and become in- 
terested in pursuing clas- 
sical studies. The Classic 
Department is booming, 
Gros Louis commented. 

Indiana University has an 
Independent Learning Pro- 
gram, which is not lim- 
ited to honor students. In 
this program, there are no 
pre-set course require- 
ments. The emphasis is 
on the process of learn- 
ing and helping students 
master that process so they 
can work independently 
throughout life. 

A student with special 
interests designs his own 
program (within the spir- 
it of a liberal arts edu- 
cation) with the guidance 
and approval of a com- 
mittee of faculty and stu- 
dents. Faculty voluntar- 
ily participate in indivi- 
dual tutorials, adding to 
their own load what often 
amounts to teaching a whole 
separate course designed 
especially for the student. 
The Independent Learn- 
ing Program is not an 
easy path to adegeee. Each 
student does a major in- 
dependent research pro- 
ject. The titles of a few 
illustrate the demands of 
the program: "Miniatur- 
ized Continuous Gradient 
Centrifugatlon as a Tech- 
nique In Neurosciences," 
"Conceptual Analysis of 
the Meaning and Use of 
the Nominal Cases and 
Postpositions in Designa- 
ting Position In the Esto- 
nia n Language," and "At- 
titudes Toward Historyand 
the Tradition in the Poetry 
of T.S. Eliot and Ezra 
Pound." 

Flexibility also has en- 
tered the scientific field. 
At LU„ there are several 
courses designed for non- 
science majors. These 
stress the role and im- 
portance of the scientific 
fields. Appreciatlngof sci- 
ence will be more use- 
ful to non-science majors 
than the traditional begin- 
ning course in a subject 
which is really designed 
as the first Btep~to spec- 
ialization, Gros Louis said. 
The science series in- 
cludes a course called 
"Excursions In Mathema- 
tics," as well as courses 
In physics, chemistry, and 
several biological sci- 
ences. The courses em- 
phasize theory but do in- 



clude some laboratory 
work. 

A "J-course" at I.U. 
Is an experimental course. 
Sometimes these are cre- 
ated by students — and even 
taught by them. J-courses 
are not part of the regular 
curriculum, but do offer 
academic credit toward 
graduation. Many have e- 
ventually been accepted in- 
to the curriculum. 

Students who design and 
teach courses often learn 
more from that experience 
than they would simply ta- 
king a course, Gros Louis 
said. They learn that it 
takes planning and organ- 
ization to develop a course; 
it is not simply making up 
a reading list. 

The J-courses provide 
a place for trying new ap- 
proaches to learning as 
well ascontent. Professors 
are developing many 
courses utilizing new ways 
of teaching and presenting 
materials. These have 
proved effective in such 
fields as mathematics, for- 
eign language, and politi- 
cal science. 

One of the most publi- 
cized Innovations at I.U. 
is the experimental "aca- 
demic bankruptcy" policy, 
which allows a student to 
"eliminate" a semester's 
work which suffered se- 
verely because of personal 
or financial difficulties. 

The elimination involves 
eliminating the record 
from computation of grad- 
uation requirements and 
grade point average) not 
removing it from the tran- 
script entirely, Gros Louis 
noted. 

He added tijat though aca- 
demic bankruptcy has 
sparked public Interest, It 
affects only a few students 
and is not the most aig- 
nificanc program in the to- 
tal College of Arts and 
Sciences,

Mythical morality- 
a rebuttal 



The notion chat Che Issue 
of sexual inexclusivicy is 
not a real problem Is plaus- 
ible only when aeen from 
a societal viewpolnc. It is 
true that It is not a near- 
future possibility for 
society co accepc tocal sex- 
ual freedom, (and it may 
also be true that we as 
human beings are noc ready 
to accept theresponslblUcy 
for our own sexuality); but 
Is this the Issue? Is It not 
a real problem when one 
Individual finds that he or 
she is laden with guilt 
feelings, frustrations, and 
anxieties which aredirecc- 
ly connected to his or her 
sexuality? Js waiting for 
social norms to be changed, 
or waiting until conditions 
are such that the norms can 
be changed - is this not 
merely perpetuating the 
myth of social norms which 
has caused the problem In 
the first place? 

Men and women have sex- 
uality because they are 
born with natural sexual 
capacities. Their sexual- 
ity is one mode of exist- 
ing in the world, one mode 
of expression oftheir real- 
ity. If sexuality Is a mere 
function, then this ex- 
pression suggests that we 
are not free, but rather 
machines. If it Is going to 
have meaning, however, we 
must supply it. what our

sexuality means and how we 
use it reflects how we view 
ourselves. If our sexual 
views are without re- 
flection. I.e. if our views 
are totally molded by 
social norms, then this 
suggests that we are noth- 
ing but puppets for some 
non - existent social 
machine. 

What are some guidelines 
for choosing a position In 
for choosing a position in 
relationship to our sexual 
interaction? The most pri- 
mary consideration is the 
consequences of the act. 
Our actions In the present 
are meaningful inasfar as 
they fulfill some goal we 
have chosen. We first must 
decide what we're after if 
we are to be able to judge 
where we're at. Isdemand-

of limiting the other's free-

demanding sexual in- 
exclusivlty a way of bribing 
the other to give more? 
These are iiuestions that 
must ultimately be asked. 
The problem with pro- 
pounding freedom without 
considerations of respons- 
ibility now becomes 
evident: On the one side. 
If we allow social myths 
to determine the meaning 
of our sexuity, it becomes 
empty and unfulfllling; on 
the other, if there is to'al 
freedom In sexuality 
without responsibility, it 
becomes meaningless and 
Irrelevant. The balance 
between the two ends is up

And the children go to

(as sung by Pete Seeger) 

It is interesting Chat our 
psychology department 
teaches us about leart\Ing, 
motivation, and normal hu- 
man behavior by starving 
rats, then giving them a 
tiny food pellet when they 
perform up to pre-deter- 
mined specifications. Tor- 
ture enough animals and we 
may learn to be human be- 
ings. 

Science, in order to be 
exact, has given us notions 
of "exact" units of time, 
"exact" units of space. It's 
interesting chat there Is no 
exact definition of "exact." 
More Interesting Is that, 
even though the time we 
live In Is a flow rather 
than individual segments, 
common sense academia 
teaches us to live by the 
scientist's digital clock, E- 
ven though the electron mi- 
croscope has shown uathat 
objects are made up of con- 
stantly flowing molecules, 
we view the world as 
merely a collection of stag- 
nant, determinate objects. 
And what does that make 
of our experiences? Stag- 
nant, determinate objects. 

And what does that make 
of our learning? Tiny 
eight-component bits of in- 
formation spewed from the 
teachers fortran mouth. 
Sorry, sonny, but you were 
rejected in the B-pocket. 
Reprogram. Re-run, Beep. 

It is, indeed, fascinating 
to see how well we've 



learned to make other 
people things. A chick with 
nice tits. Burning Viet- 
namese flesh. Sucker stu- 
dents to keep it all going. 
Machines to push torpedo 
release buttons. Human 
cattle to held to boot camp 
and then off to do Uncle 
Sam a favor. Exploitation 
can't be all bad when A- 
merica's pride, two poli- 
tical parties, uses it to 
survive. 

Exploitation can't be coo 
bad when a Communi- 
cations class Is taught that 
reason and truth don't mat- 
ter as long as you con- 
vince the audience. Ex- 
ploitation can't be coo bad 
when it saves ^employers 
money for not having to 
pay women-things equal 
pay. There's laws about 
that. There's principles 
of people-things' rights and 
freedoms; there's also the 
Slave - Master Selective 
Service System. Sorry, 
sonnyj you're a free A- 
merlcan boy with fine par- 
ents, two brothers, one sis- 
ter, one fiancee; however, 
because we gave you all 
of this, you must go to 
war and be killed in ac- 
tion. Serving his country, 
19 years old. Exploita- 
tion Is Benevolence. 

Then there's a military 
that not only maks^. men 
out of petty people, ■ but 
also argues that the only 
way to secure peace is to 
threaten the most violence. 
The only way we can ra- 
tionalize our Military-In- 
dustrial Complex is to 
make it more necessary. 
Peace is Violence. Security 
is Insecurity, 

A play comes to the 
theater to show the cor- 
ruptness and Insanity of 
our situation; it Is called 
i m mora 1, indecent, unfit

Is about. When a child is 
born, he or she (or may- 
be it already) is confron- 
ted with all this violence 
and insanity, named Love 
and Sanity. 

We teach children at an 
early age all about pro- 
, prlety, rules, nice things, 
nasty things, good people, 
bad people, the Bible, Mr. 
President. We want our 
children to have more ma- 
terial things to fight over 
than we had, so make cer- 
tain both parentsare work- 
ing after the child reaches 
age four. Of course, the 
parents need time alone on 
Friday night, Saturday eve- 
ning for dinner dates at the 
night club. Then we fin- 
ish the week off by send- 
ing the children co church, 
then a quick dinner, and a 
football game on T.V. 

We teach the little girls 
to not be intelligent, to not 
be self-sufficient, to not 
be self-actualizing, but to 
be ladies and mommiesand 
cooks and bodies. V/e teach 
little boys to be men, to be 
strong, to put down women, 
to constitute the power 
structure, to be the "pants 
of the family," to bring 
home the pay check. And 
little girls become ladies 
and mommies and cooks 
and bodies. And the lit- 
,tle boys bccQnje.^strQng.,, 
■and ready ■V&amp;--AGtv&amp;'-^&amp;'" 
Nation and authoritative 
and Important. 

We want to train our 
'.children to be as Insane 
as we are, but with college 
degrees. One can't live 
until he or she gets a good 
job. And one can't really 
live until he or she has 
a few luxuries. Several,, 
cars. Color television, Flf-. 
teen charge cards. A large 
house with central air con- 
ditioning. And one can't 
really, really live until he 
or she retires. And one 
can't,., and then one dies. 
New program. 

We are quietly destroy- 
ing ourselves with all the 
violence and myths and all 
the Insanity, but we call it 
Love, Truth, Goodness, 
Sanity, The peacemaking 
Marines are now drawing 
up one more war game to 
learn. So we learn some 
more war. We call It 
Prestige. Honor. 

Torturing animals leads 
one to believe that the sci- 
entists are right. Life is 
a meaningless, brutal fact. 
If anyone rebels. If anyone 
sees things differently, 
then he or she must be in- 
sane. That person, must be 
locked up. Catholic priests 
are given many years In 
prison for burning paper. 
Insane people - things are 
committed to institutions. 
Well I'm going to begin 
hunting for my sanity Just 
so I can get rid of It. 
Let me be Insane in peace. 
Want to join me? 1 1 Is 
a very interesting life if 
you don't think about It too 
long.

"We need a 'ical salesman" 




elate Board composed of 
ten members. 

Four SUB officers are in 
charge of all Board pro- 
jects. Chairman Michael 
G. Yann is responsible for 
directing and overseeing 
SUB activities and the 
spending of the allocated 
$15,000. He is assisted by 
Vice Chairman Rusty Cane, 
Treasurer StanScheimann, 
and Secretary Kama 
SchoUe. 

Chairman Yann urges all 
students "to let me or 
members of the Union 
Board Irnow how they want 
us to spend their money 
and to help make these 
campus activities the best 
they've ever been." 

In the past, activities 
handled by the SUB were 
the Penny Carnival, the 
Mid-Winter Carnival. Har- 
bararbar Days, the Dean's 
Ball, and numerous dances 
and concerts. In addition 
to these projects, this 
year's Board Is planning 
a ski trip, a best ball golf 
tournament, a hayrlde, and 
a big concert In the Coli- 
seum with a top name 
group. 

sub's first social event 
this year was held a few 
weeks ago. It was also a 
mixer-dance, and a fair 
attendance was reponed. 
One problem cited by 
the Board Is that SUB- 
sponsored .activities, along 
with generally every other 
event held at Indiana-Pur- 
due, have had rather low 
attendance. According to 



Chairman Yann, "The 
cause and effect of thlshas 
been because of thenon-ln- 
volvement of the students 
with the Union Board. Thus, 
the SUB does not know what 
the students want in the 
line of social activities. 

"I plan to raise the in- 
volvement factor," ex- 
plains Yann, "by getting 
the students involved. This 
year we areallocatedmore 
money and we are raising 
the standard of perform- 
ances and activities. 

"We have the money," 
Yann continued, "and If 
the students will let the 
SUB know what they would 
like in the form of en- 
tertainment, 1 feel that we 
can raise the amount of 
Involvement substantially, 
but only If the students let 
us know howthey want their 
money spent." 

The distribution of the 
SUB'a $15,000 Isdone sole- 
ly by students. Although 
two faculty advisors are 
present at meetings, they 
are there only to advise. 
The final say Is made by 
students as to how money 
Is spent. 

The Indiana-Purdue Stu- 
dent Union Board has been 
well-known for its ener- 
getic and resourceful 
members who are involved 
in all sorts of campus ac- 
tivities. If anyone is In- 
terested In the SUB, they 
may contact Mike Yann 
through the Students' Gov- 
ernment Office, Room 109, 
off the Student Lounge.

Seals and 
Crofts 
takes you 
'Down 
Home' 

by Dave Hill 

A mandolin player and a 
guitarist - violinist; 
decidedly not a common 
combination on the music 
Bcene today. Jimmy Seals 
and Dash Crofts are doing 
a good Job with it though, 
as evidenced on their new- 
est album, "Down Home." 

This Is their fourth al- 
bum, so Seals and Crofts 
have been around for a good 
while. Yet they still haven't 
received much recognition. 
Their last album, "Year 
of Sundays," was a mild 
success, and they should 
gain quite a few new fans 
with this album. 

I happened to see Seals 
and Crofts on the Dick Ca- 
vett Show a while back, 
and they did two numbers 
with no accompaniment 
other than their own in- 
struments. I liked what 
I heard, and as a result 
went out and bought this 
album. They sound even 
tetter on the album, be- 
t^BSuse thfe-back'^rCufiargtil- 
led with various musicians 
on bass, piano, organ, elec- 
tric guitar and drums. 

All but one of the eleven 
songs were written by Seals 
and Crofts. Crofts' man- 
dolin Is used on every tune, 
and is featured quite a bit. 
Though Seals plays the vi- 
olin on five or six num- 
bers. It doesn't stand out 
much until side two when 
the listener is hit with a 
38 second quickie called 
"Granny Will Your Dog 
Bite?" In it. Seals sounds 
just like a caller at a square 
dance, and the way he plays 
that fiddle makes me wish 
he would've made the song 
longer. 

Crofts sings lead on all 
the songs, and Seals con- 
tributes the exceptionally 
tight harmony. The songs 
themselves could probably 
be described as electric 
folk songs or ballads. Best 
among them Is one titled 
"Cotton Mouth" In which 
the listener is lulled along 
by the soft, rythmic be- 
ginning, then jarred out 
of his seat by some fan- 
tastic licks from the elec- 
tric guitar. 

"Tin Town," asthename 
suggests, is a song about 
a child's fantasy world. 
Again, the tune sticks In 
your head after hearing it, 
which should prove to be 
an asset If any of the al- 
bum's songs are released 
as singles. 

Every song Is worth lis- 
tening to; there aren't any 
fillers on the album. A 
very solid effort by two 
fellows I hope are around 
for a long while.

"Blue Beard" not for 
blue noses 



As long as this year Is 
when womens lib iBin,a mo- 
ovle built on the Impotence 
of a cavelier European no- 
ble is in also. Add violence 
and nudity for box office 
success and you have Blue- 
beard. 

For about ten minutes Into 
the movie, the viewer Is not 
sure whether 3aronVonSe- 
ege (Richard Burton) is a 
good guy or a bad guy. But 
when his wife "mysterlos- 
ly" Is killed on a hunt, the 
Count's bad side begins to 
materialize. 

And Just to make sure ev- 
eryone Is clear as to his 
u.lBc^feveousness, he is I- 
dentltied as a German Ba- 
ron (filthy rich capitalist), 
officer In Hitler's S.S. (Bi- 
goted Fascist), and, worst 
of all, woman killer (In 
more ways than one). 

Now that one knows who he 
is against, who Is hefor?A 
number of candidates pre- 
sent themselves for select- 
ion. There are seven or 
eight wives of the Baron. 
All but Anne (Joey Heather- 
ton) are characterized as 
intolerable females: A 
throaty singer who wouldn't 
quit, a masochistic femin- 
ist, a nymphomaniac nun. It 
seems to be Pandora's box 
on parade as the Baron re- 
counts his marriages.

suasive young Jewish mu-

Chances are, though, that 
you pick your anti-hero and 
wish him/her/them luck 
throughout the movie. 

Richard Burton does a 
good job as Bluebeard, al- 
though one expect s much 
more from him. Heather- 
ton, Lisi. Et. Al. are a 
voyeurs delight as they 
strut their stuff. Unfortu-

who, we all know, is a ta- 
lented actress.) 

It can truly be said of 
Bluebeard that it has some- 
thing for everyone. Forthe 
grotesque-the Baron's 
many years dead mother, 
propped In a rocking chair 
having her hair combed by 
a decrepid maid; for the 
violent-the Baron's as- 
sassination, the murders of 
his wives, and scenes of 
Nazi stormtroopers beat- 
ing up Jews; for the lech- 
erous-eight beautiful wo- 
men sans wardrobe; and for 
the penslve-a message 
somewhere. 

Bluebeard is showing at 
the Georgetown I Theatre. 
If you like that sort of thing, 
see It; If not, you can't say 
I didn't warn you.
