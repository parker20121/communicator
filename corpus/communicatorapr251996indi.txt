Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne 



Presidential 
candidate may 
face misconduct 
charges 

by Cassle Bitter 
Staff Writer 
and S. Brant Kelley 
News Editor 

Last week, IPSGA presiden- 
tial candidate Kerry Adkins 
Tiled an official complaint with 
the student government's elec- 
tion board, asking thai it rule ihe 
ballots from Monday invalid. 
Adkins filed an additional com- 
plaint slating that George 
Gounaris bad violated elements 
of IPSGA's constitution 

Adkins said IPSGA's consti- 
tution states the ballot box must 
be secured in the office of the 
University Police directly after 
the closing of polls each day. 
Adkins said he is concerned that 
someone may have tampered 
with the ballot box since it was 
accessible to anyone in (be 
Career Services Office after vot- 
ing hours. 

Dean of Students Marian 
Zimmerman said procedures for 
handling the box have become 
lax the last few years She attrib- 
uted pan of the problem to the 
lack of a manual to which elec- 
tion board members could have 
access. 

"There's nothing written in 
any one place for everyone to 
grab," Zimmerman said, "and 
that's going to change." 

She added that the current 
situation will produce not only a 
review of the constitution, but 
also an elecuon board manual 

Zimmerman said she 
informed Adkins that University 
Police may bring charges 
against him for allegedly tam- 
pering with the ballots. In addi- 
tion, be may face a disciplinary 
review for allegedly trespassing 
into Zimmerman's office, 
according to Zimmerman. 

She said she doesn't believe 
Adkins' intent was malicious, 
but be should bave bandied the 
complaint by other means than 
by entering into her open office 
after dark 

"1 do believe that (he did not 
intend to do barm)." 
Zimmerman said. "I think he 
was right to be concerned ..File 
a complaint with the election 
board." 

As of this week, no formal 
charges have been filed because 
Zimmerman wanted any action 
to be separated from the elec- 
tions themselves. 

"I haven't received anything 
official from 1PFW concerning 
any violation on my part,'' 
Adkins said. "Due to the fact 
that the ballot box wasn't in the 
proper place as IPSGA constitu- 
tion states, tne ballots from 
Monday should be ruled 
invalid." 

In addition to the ballot box 
not being where it was supposed 
to be, Adkins claims that 
George Gounaris, winner of 
IPSGA's presidential election, 
broke major constitutional vot- 
ing rules.

Gounaris runs away with presidency 



by Cassit Kitter 

Chief Reporter 

and S. Brant Kelley 

News Editor 

The 1996 Indiana-Purdue Student 
Government Association (IPSGA) 
elections came to an end last Friday at 
noon The results showed George Gounaris 
won the presidency, and Chris Douse won the 
vice presidency. 

George Gounaris ran against Kerry 
Adkins. Gounaris obtained 388 votes com- 
pared to Kerry Adkins' 123 votes for presi- 
dent of the student body. 

"I would hope that if George becomes 



president that he will keep in mind the stu- 
dents' concerns when it comes to luition and 
fee increases," Adkins said, "because that is 
exacUy what's coming down the line from the 
administration. 

"I hope he doesn't jump on the university 
bandwagon and state that this is really what 
we need when the students have been finan- 
cially burdened long enough." 

Gounaris said he wants to see luition fee 
increases remain at a minimum. 

"I don't receive any form of financial aid 
or other support for my tuition," Gounaris 
said, "so every lime tuition goes up, it affects 
me one hundred percent because I pay 
one hundred percent-" 



Gounans also said the student body must 
get involved as a whole 

"One person speaking up tails on deaf 
ears," be said. "But ten thousand students can 
have an impact. In this campus, I will contin- 
ue to do so until we can improve communica- 
tion . „ and that applies towards any issue." 

The office of vice president of legislation 
had four contestants Chns Douse won with 
304 votes; Tan "Tony" Bui came in second 
with 144 votes; J. Tilden Brown obtained 42 
votes, while Tony Laux received 40. 

The office of vice president of finance will 
be filled by Michael Heit, who was uncon- 
tested for the fourth straight year. Erin Fridh 
also ran uncontested and received 416 votes 



to be the programming director. 

Only three students petitioned for seats in 
the student senate. Current president Kevin 
Eads petitioned for senate and received 307 
signatures. Gina Burgess petitioned and 
received 300 signatures, while Linda Shelton 
obtained 277. 

In the accompanying ballot asking if stu- 
dents thought Walb Memorial Union should 
be renamed Walb Memorial Students' Union, 
364 students voted yes, while 122 voted no. 

According to Steven Kauffman. elecuon 
board member, an estimated 539 students 
voted He said that number is a typical 
turnout average.

University employees 
shafted ... again 



"OOOOOOH. OK What's goin' 
on?"- Beavis 

It looks like 1PSGA is not the 
only organization tbai needs to buy 
a calendar. The administration told 
Eurest (formerly The Fort, lPFW's 
definition of food) April 15 would 
be the day it learned its future on 
campus. The Eurest contract 
expired this year and they have lost 
their contract 

Tbe people who work in (be 
cafeteria deserved better than what 
they received from the administra- 
tion. The administration should not 
have let toe employees dangle from 
a book like some forgotten piece of 
meal 

Those workers, many of whom 
have families, were in the dark 
about their future for one week 
after the date given to them by the 
administration. 

Tbe administration knew what 
their recommendation was on Apnl 

15. but they wailed like spineless they would realize thai The Fort's 
administrators, afraid to tell their employees are people and deserve 
people bad news When the con- more respect than they received, 
tract is signed by the new vendor 
and Purdue, the decision will be 

Kudos to campus police 



official. Shouldn't a financial agent 
be more than just a scapegoat for 
tough decisions? 

At The Communicator we 
understand deadlines and we con- 
sistently meet them Are adminis- 
trators lacking so much in human 
consideration that they failed to live 
up to their word? We know the 
administration is not this inconsid- 
erate when it comes to tuition, 
library late fees or parking tickets 

Tbe administration wastes no 
time to gel its money The adminis- 
tration wastes no time in washing 
out students who have not paid 
their tuition Tbe administration 
wastes no lime during registration 
days Why were the employees of 
The Fori given less respeel than 
students? (Or is that "less respect 
than students' money?") Maybe if 
tbe administration would slop treat- 
ing IPFW less like a business and 
like an institution of learning 



In an effort to dispel any rumors 
thai all cops are pigs, we have a 
story io tell. 

One of The Communicator's 
staff members was recently strand- 
ed at the corner of Coliseum 
Boulevard and Crescent Avenue 
without anyone to call or any hope 
of a miracle. The university police 
offered to loan a gallon of gas with 
(he only repayment being thai of 
replenishing the gas can. 

When that didn'i work, the 
police pushed the siranded car to a 
not -so -near service siaiion and 
tried to jump the car After that 



effort failed, the university police 
made sure the strandee had some- 
one to call for a safe ride home 
This whole procedure took about 
forty-five minutes and the officers 
never once ridiculed or made the 
staff member feel automotively- 
illiterate. In fact, the officers were 
cordial and comforting Not adjec- 
tives often used to describe police 
officers 

So to them we offer a hardy 
THANK YOU And we urge other 
IPFW family members to feel 
secure in asking them for assis- 
tance.

Letters to the editor 



Souder 

dominates 

media 



To the editor; 

After reading Souder's com- 
plaint about too many people in our 
district disagreeing with him 
(Journal Gazette. March 31. 1996), 
a question occurred to me: Why is 
this guy whining? 

Souder's got the media in this 
town just about locked up. He' got 
bis own weekly radio show on 
WGL. and he's featured on another 
show on the same station each week 
as well, but bis Republican primary 
opponent and the three Democratic 
primary candidates are not granted 
equal time On the call-in show, 
Souder's partisan hosts are quick to 
hang up on callers who are critical 
of the incumbent Souder need not 
worry about disagreeing with his 
extremist agenda on corporate talk 
radio, which silences dissent for 
him, and effectively gives him free 
weekly campaign promotions that 
don't have to be reported to the 
Federal Election Commission 

Souder need not worry about the 
local television network affiliates 
either When the single credible 
candidate in the Democratic con- 
gressional primary, Jerry 
Houseman, recently held a press 
conference on environmental poli- 
cy, all ihree of tbe local television 
news shows declined to cover it, but 
none of them are averse to broad- 
casting spin control puff pieces on 
Souder. 

As for the print journalism, one 
local daily newspaper continues a 
virtual blackout on coverage of 
Houseman, despite the candidate's 
numerous position releases on fair 
labor policies, tax system reform, 
healthcare, regulatory relief for 
small businesses and many other 
important issues 

While Souder gets plenty of flat- 
tering press locally, oddly enough, 
many lcss-than-flattering facts 
about the incumbent arc never 
reported, I didn'i learn about 
Souder's refusal to support the reso- 
lution against the "midnight 
payraise" approved by the previous 
session of Congress, for example, 
until Ralph Nader brought it up 
when he spoke at IPFW last 
September By this refusal, Souder 
effectively supported granting him- 
self a pay increase. This from a guy 



who actively seeks to gut wage 
standards for ordinary working 
Americans, which have already lost 
16 percent of their real value over 
the last two decades. This from a 
guy who adamantly opposes any 
increase in the minimum wage. 
which has lost 26 percent of its 
actual value over tbe past two 
decades. 

Those who support Jerry 
Houseman's campaign for honest 
and responsive representation, the 
thousands of Fourth District resi- 
dents who oppose Souder's destruc- 
tive agenda, are far more limited in 
terms of communication access than 
Souder In addition to bis media 
lock-up, Souder cranks out tens of 
thousands of dollars worth of tax- 
funded franked mailings promoting 
himself, and he's already filled his 
campaign coffers with tobacco, 
alcohol and other big-money contri- 
butions, ensuring plenty of spin- 
control ads come next November 

In light of this. Souder's fretting 
over those letters to tbe editor that 
disagree with bim suggest Souder 
may be the biggest whiner on God's 
green earth. 



Hispanos 
Unidos 
gets no 
respect 

To the editor; 

Diversity on the IPFW campus 
does not exist and we offer Ibis 
proof: 

Last semester the Hispanos 
Unidos student organization want- 
ed to find a way to promote 
Hispanics in a positive manner. 
What better way to do this than a 
charily ball used lo obtain monies 
for a scholarship fund named 
Amigos de los hispanos which 
translates inio Friends of tbe 
Hispanics? We put this plan into 
action in December by reserving tbe 
ballroom with Walb Union 
Operations. This was a verbal reser- 
vation that somehow never made it 
into the system. 



The ballroom was given lo an 
outside organization that has no 
affiliation witb the university. The 
reason given to Hispanos Unidos 
was that the outside organization's 
signed contract was more concrete 
than (he agreement which Hispanos 
Unidos gave first In a court of law 
a verbal contract is as powerful as a 
signed contract. 

Furthermore it was recently 
brought to the attention of Hispanos 
Unidos that IPSGA would be help- 
ing in the sponsorship of the charity 
ball because (he money raised 
would be going toward the Hispanic 
student fund which would in fact 
belp promote the university and 
belp to maintain if not increase stu- 
dent enrollment This agreement 
was later rescinded. It is also our 
understanding that a member of the 
administration was tbe one who 
instigated this change of IPSGA's 
word of honor. 

The whole point is this: No one 
seems lo care about our organiza- 
tion. Whenever Hispanos Unidos 
tries to have an event that will not 
only benefit Latino students, but (he 
whole community, we are stopped. 
But this never seems to happen to 
any of the other student organiza- 
tions The Black Collegiate Caucus 
(BCC) can seem to do whatever it 
wants witb great ease, but we con- 
tinuously have to cross thick red 
tape and even that doesn't seem to 
be enough. Not that the BCC is not 
doing great things, but we want the 
chance to join their efforts in creat- 
ing a friendlier, more unified cam- 
pus The International Students 
Organization can receive money for 
a fundraising banquet, but we can't 
do this even lo help students? The 
Biology Club can get $2000 to 
sponsor Earth Day celebrations, 
which may have helped the environ- 
ment, but none of the students who 
put in their blood, sweat and tears. 

With this new attention on diver- 
sity, why docs the administration 
insist on stifling the efforts of those 
organizations and students who are 
diverse? If the university wants to 
draw students and faculty of color, 
it needs to recognize all colors of 
ihe spectrum. We, Ihe people of 
Hispanos Unidos, are quality people 
and can achieve great things if 
only someone would lei us.

Vote Tom 
Harris 



To the editor; 

I've grown up with and known 
Tom Harris for more than 28 years. 
That's why I'm writing this letter to 
encourage the registered voters of 
Allen County lo cast your vote for 
him in the May 7 primary for 
County Council. 

Tom has demonstrated his lead- 
ership abilities by his participation 
in numerous community and profes- 
sional organizations, including: 
president of Leadership Fort 
Wayne; administrative board mem- 
ber at Si. Joseph United Methodist 
Church; past president of IPFW 
Alumni Association; Fort Wayne 
Jaycees; Three Rivers Literacy 
Alliance, board member and certi- 
fied tutor, and IPFW student body 
president. 

Tom also has political experi- 
ence that includes: president of the 
Allen Couniy Republican Club, 
president of the Indiana Young 
Republicans; Precinct Committee 
member; and delegate to the 
Republican State Convention 

I feel Tom can do ihe job of 
County Council because as the 
Director of Human Resources for 
Allen Couniy: he attended 98 per- 
cent of all Couniy Council meet- 
ings: he was directly involved in tbe 
last 4 years of budgets passed by the 
County Council; and he has been 
accountable to the County Council 
for questions or concerns for per- 
sonnel salaries and wages (this rep- 
resents over 60 percent of tbe entire 
County's budget). 

Why should the Allen Couniy 
taxpayers pay to train someone for 
iwo years as a County Council per- 
son when Tom has the experience 
to make the tough decisions now 
and the knowledge to ask (be right 
questions to the right people? It 
doesn't make sense to vole for 
another candidate for Couniy 
Councd. 

So 1 urge you lo vote in the May 
7 primary for Tom Harris for 
County Council because his accom- 
plishments are more than a list of 
activities. Through Tom's active 
roles, he accepts and follows 
through on his commitments by 
assuming personal responsibility for 
bis community and by providing for 
his community and by providing 
continued effective leadership for 
die citizens of Allen County

heads in incredulous disbelief 
What is your point, we wonder 
Why are you so proud of the human 
pain and suffering witnessed by 
your era? Do you really have so 
much hubris that you cannot see the 
struggles we face 1 It is insane to 
insist that a generation's worth can 
be measured by the amount of suf- 
fering it has endured, and it makes 
even less sense to assume that such 
things can be quantified. 

If you must see reality in this 
way. however, why do you not look 
more closely at our experiences? 
We have our Vietnam today. It is a 
quieter war. a less publicized war, 
but it is killing us with the same 
indifferent destruction. Do not 
assume that only you know the 
aching pain of facing death too 
soon. You had the draft, we have 
the two-week wailing period. We 
live with the knowledge that AIDS 
is among us and we can't stop it 
We see young people dying every- 
day and know that it could strike us 
at any moment For us, there is no 
lottery, no short tour of duty, no 
education deferment. There is only 
quiet wailing; there is only the dis- 
gusting awareness that sex equals 
death. 

Oh, we suffer. We suffer from a 
lack of role models. Our young 
women appreciate your Gloria 
Steinems and Betty Friedans, but 
their wonderful rhetoric docs not 
answer the basic questions, who am 
I in the world 7 at school? al work'' 
at home? Our young men look 
around and wonder why so many 
seek to persecute them for actions 
they never committed. Despite your 



fine ideals, our gays and lesbians 
still have no place in society. And 
the great experiment for which we 
were you laboratory mice still con- 
tinues. Don't you realize that your 
noble belief in racial harmony and 
its subsequent forced busing has 
been earned out through ihe tears 
and blood of this generation Of 
course we are happy to have inte- 
gration, but where, are our dues? 
Where are our role models? We are 
responsible for this great shift 
toward justice, not you Your con- 
tribution ended when you rode that 
Freedom Bus home way back in 
1966. We have our defining

and just as significant as yours. 

So, if you must know who we 
are. you need only look in the mir- 
ror We insist that neither 
Hollywood nor Wall Street can 
define us. because wc do not want 
to be exploited We are loo aware, 
too jaded for such nonsense. And so 
we answer the question cryptically 
bui with honesty: We are the prod- 
ucts of a grand revolution begun by 
you and then abandoned by you. 
And. unfortunately, we are the 
products of your same fears and 
prejudices Finally, we are a new 
generation with expectations of a 
new world.

Signing off from Janets Planet 

A fond farewell 




Well, here n is. Ihe end of the 
semester. Although we had the 
longest winter in recent memory, 
the semester zoomed by Or at least 
the last few weeks did Well, this 
week is going pretty fast, I mean 

For some of us. this is the end of 
our course work at 1PFW. 1 am 
among those who graduate May 8. 
Having been at IPFW for so long. I 
leave with feelings of pride and 
relief, as well as some uncertainly 
in now facing the "real world." 

I also know that I will miss 

MMfllflM 



many of the people I 
have been fortunate 
enough to get to 
know Perhaps some 
of us will keep in 
touch as lime goes 
by. 

I have grown to 
appreciate the incred- 
ible wealth we have 
in our professors and 
instructors. With 
their knowledge and commitment to 
the students, they make our univer- 
sity one we should be proud to 
attend. 

As I go on to Ihe work world, 
and hope to start my career as a 
writer, I'm sure 1 will look back on 
IPFW with fondness and gratitude 
for giving me a good base from 
which to start 

Writing feature stones for The 



Communicator was one of the best 
things I did at IPFW. I learned 
about many of ihe faces and places 
that make up our campus. For those 
of you who will still be here next 
fall, keep in mind that writing fea- 
tures is a great way to work on your 
writing skills, while helping to 
increase awareness of and involve- 
ment in campus activities. 

This is the end, for now, of 
Janet's Planet. I wish you all peace, 
good grades and a relaxing summer 
break.

Madonna did it on David

every reporter how to do it. George

Limbaugh brags about how well he

wherever the bell he wants to. 

These people have a bond which 
has created a new counter-culture 
America Cigars and the people 
who love ibem The boom started 
three and a half years ago when ihe 
edilor and publisher of "Wine 
Spectator," Marvin Shanken, creat- 
ed the magazine "Cigar 
Aficionado." What Shanken did 
was to apply the same principles 
and categories lo cigar smoking 
mat were applied lo fine wines. 

Very few people in Fort Wayne 
lake cigar smoking as seriously as 
Byron Braun, president of the Fort 
Wayne Cigar Connoisseurs Club 
Braun used to be involved with the 
Chicago Cigar Connoisseurs Club 
and decided to create a similar 
coterie in Fort Wayne. 

Braun said the circle began with 
only 20 members three years ago 
and now has mushroomed to 122 
members The club meets four 
times a year and mel last Tuesday 
for their "Signature Dinner" at 
Bill's Bistro 

"The only thing we have in com- 
mon is cigars. Thai is the glue of 
our club," Braun said 

Bill's Bistro is one of a few cigar 
friendly restaurants in Fort Wayne. 
Most restaurants allow cigareiie 
smoking but forbid cigar or pipe 
smoking (go figure). One restau- 
rant which is bucking this trend is 
Cafe Johnell 

"A good cigar will have an 
aroma, but a bad cigar will stink," 
remarks Nike Spillson, president of 
Cafe Johnell Her father laught her 
the finer points of cigar smoking 
which she applies to her patronage. 
Her father also had an illicit source 
of Cuban cigars (Cuban cigars 
have been illegal for several gener- 



ations.) Caffi Johnell allows cigar- 
smoking at certain occasions but it 
musi be a quality cigar The restau- 
rant also features an stale -of- the - 
art air purification system which 
cleanses the air of the cigar aroma. 

If (he cigar does noi meet 
Spillson's high standards, she will 
introduce them to an exceptional 
cigar Cigar smoking is a recre- 
ational activity, and tbe smoker 
should use it as a relaxation tool, 
according to Spillson. 

"Communal sharing of leisure 
and cigar smoking are great stress 
relievers," Spillson explains 

The renaissance of cigar smok- 
ing has been a boon to many of the 
tobacco stores in Fort Wayne. 

"What happened was the editor 
of 'Cigar Aficionado' got the right 
representation like Bill Cosby and 
Rush Limbaugh to promote the 
cigar industry." Frank Bougher 
says within the humid confines of 
Riegel's Pipe and Tobacco Store's 
cigar room. (The cigar room is 
about the size of a walk-in closet 
and is humidified to keep the cig- 
ars moisL) 

Bougher explains how the cigar 
smoker of today differs from the 
one of five or ten years ago 
Traditionally, men just chose a 
brand and stayed with it. Today's 
connoisseurs are educating them- 
selves about the finer points of cig- 
ars and experimenting with them to 
find tbe perfect cigar, Bougher 
says. 

"We've got more people who've 
never smoked before come in and 
ask for a good cigar," Bougher 
remarks. 

This consumer desire for a new 
cigar experience is driving the 
market to try new things and create 
more varieties for the discerning 
cigar smoker, according to 
Bougher. The massive demand 
for cigars has surpassed the 
industry's ability to keep up 
with rising consumer needs. 
Bougher said nationwide cigar 
sales increased 40 percent while 
production last year only 
jumped up by 20 percent

Amanda "Victot/Vicloria" draws on a fine Honduran Robuslo (cigar term (or short and blunt). 



Bougher explained that the rea- 
son behind the industry's inability 
to supply the market is the time it 
takes to grow and age a crop of 
tobacco. Usually, a tobacco crop is 
aged two or three years before cig- 
ars are made Tobacco growers 
were not prepared for the "Cigar 
Renaissance." Prices have been ris- 
ing at an alarming rate according to 
Bougher 

"Usually cigar prices are bumped 
up about five percent once a year, 
but just this year pnees have risen 
twice at a rate of 10 to 15 percent 
each lime," Bougher said. 

Bougher calls it gouging but he 
hopes this will lead to more pipe 
smoking. Pipe tobacco is cheaper 
than cigars and Riegel's business 
used to be aimed toward pipe 
smokers. 

In the last two years, Bougher 
said Riegel's cigar business has 
increased tenfold, and three per- 



cent of their sales are 
buying cigars for themselves 

"If I were around a group of 
women who are smoking them I 
would, but usually 1 just smoke my 
husband's," commented a woman 
who was buying cigars for her hus- 
band. 

The proper way to light 
and smoke a cigar 

Lighting a cigar differs from 
lighting a cigarette At no time 
should the smoker ever let Ihe 
flame touch the cigar. Flames 
scorch the leaf and create an acrid 
taste similar to bumt paper 

Matches are the preferred choice 
of ignition for true cigar smokers 
When the match is lighted, the 
smoker should let the flame con- 
sume the sulfuric head of the 
match. If the smoker does not wait 
for the head to burn completely, 
then there is the possibility of ruin- 
ing a whole cigar. Sulfur filtered 



through tobacco creates a rather 
unpleasant taste according to 
"Cigar Aficionado's Pocket Guide 
to buying and smoking a cigar " 
Match sticks made from cedar pro- 
duce tbe best aroma and taste. 

Never under any circumstances 
light a cigar from a candle. The 
wax wilt completely ruin the 
cigar's taste. The aroma discharged 
from the cigar will be unpleasant 
much like the scent of a cigarette 
when it bums down lo the filter 

Once the cigar is lit, the connois- 
seur should rotate tbe cigar to 
ensure an even bum. 

A premium cigar is most often 
enhanced by the proper choice of 
wine or liquor The most popular is 
a fine cognac or brandy The 
brandy or cognac should be barrel- 
aged lo enhance the essence of the 
cigar. Bourbon or scotch also make 
wonderful companions to a superi- 
or cigar.

about gradually," he said.

Cox, 61, said he wants to spend

Gounaris said he continually 
verified his actions with the elec- 
tion board. 

"The facts haven't been checked 
out." he said. 

Adkins said the IPSGA constitu- 
tion states that a candidate must 
submu an itemized expenditure lisi 
to the election board before ihe 
closing of polls on Friday 

"George did not lum that list in 
before the closing of the polls on 
Friday," Adkins said. 

Gounaris responded by saying 
the election board granted an 
extension because not all bills were 
received by his campaign in a time- 
ly manner. 

Adkins also said the IPSGA 
constitution states all campaigning 
material must be removed from the 
campus within 24 hours after the 
closing of ihe polls on Fnday 

"George slill had flyers up in 
the buildings." Adkins said. "I 
Hied an official complaint with the 
election board regarding these vio- 
lations. They should disqualify him 
because these are two major viola- 
tions of constitutional rules." 

"The only violation was ... I still 
had campaign flyers up after noon 
on Saturday." Gounaris said. 
"Keny Adkins also had flyers up 
after noon on Saturday, as wit- 
nessed by an election board offi- 
cial." 

Gounaris added that the election 
board cleared him of all other vio- 
lations concerning campaigning. 

Adkins said if the eleciion board 
rules in favor of Gounaris, he will 
lake it lo Ihe judicial court and 
from there to the campus appeals 
board. 

"He is supposed to be the leader 
of IPSGA and if he can't follow 
these rules just during election 
time, how do we know that the 
rules are going 10 be followed (dur- 
ing his tenure)." Adkins said. "To 
say ihat he broke ihe rules and can 
still be president brings out a lot of 
serious doubi about the people who 
are leading." 



HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. What's the point of 
HIV testing? If you've 
got HIV, you're going to 
die "before your time" 
and why would anyone 
want to know that? 

A. Medicines are now 
available that can prolong 
the period of good health 
and prevent illness in 
people with HIV. Better 
treatments and possibly a 
cure may be found before 
those now infected get sick 
or die. Also, if you are 
infected, you must take 
precautions not to infect 
others.

Universiiy of Connecticut All- 
American Ray Allen has decided to 
forego his final year or eligibility 
and enter the National Basketball 
League draft 

The 6-foot-5 guard averaged 
23.4 points per game last season 
while leading the Huskies to the 
Big East Tournament championship 
and an NCAA tournament appear- 
ance He announced bis decision at 
a press conference from Gampcl 
Pavilion where he helped UConn 
amass a 19-1 home court record 
over the past three seasons. 
Nebraska Q&amp; Laid, 
to rent... 

About 4.000 mourners paid their 
final respecis to Brook Bernnger 
and Tobcy Lake Monday in 
Goodland. Kan. 

Bemnger, the back-up quarter- 
back who replaced an injured 
Tommic Fra/.icr and helped 
Nebraska to the 1994 national 
championship, was killed in a plane 
crash near Lincoln. Neb., last 
Thursday Lake, who was a passen- 
ger in the plane, was Bernnger's 



girlfriend's brother 

Air Force jets played one last 
tribute as the two caskets were 
placed inside Max Jones Fieldhouse 
where Bemnger had played basket- 
ball in high school Lake's casket 
was adorned with a heap of red 
roses. Perched atop Bemnger's was 
the helmet he had worn as a football 
player for the 'Huskcrs. 

Two scholarship funds have 
been established in memory of 
Bernnger who was 22 years old and 
was expected to have been selected 
in the NFL draft conducted just two 
days after his death. 
Houston center sets

Rocket's center Hakeem 
Olajuwon became the NBA's all- 
time leader in blocked shots 
Sunday The record setting block 
came against Phoenix Sun's guard 
A.C. Green Olajuwon now has 
3.190 blocks. 

Blocks have been kept as an offi- 
cial staiisbc since the 1973-74 sea- 
son, the fifth of Kareem Abdul- 
Jabbar's 20-year career, five years 
after Bill Russell retired and one 
season after Will Chamberlain's 



final games. 

Even more impressive is the fact 
that Olajuwon accomplished the 
feat in 12 seasons, while it took 
Abdul-Jabbar 20 seasons to set the 
previous record of 3.189 blocked 
shots. 

Miami tosses OR a 
new Heal... 

Dan Marino, the NFL's most 
prolific passer, signed a three-year 
contract extension with the 
Dolphins on Tuesday. Terms of the 
agreement were not disclosed, but it 
is believed the deal is worth S18 
million 

The signing comes just one week 
after Denver inked a five-year.

The 34-year-old Marino has

completions (3.913). attempts 
(6,571), and touchdown passes 
(352). 

Hart Albert is at it 
again... 

Indian's slugger Albert Belle is 
once again being investigated for an 
incident stemming from his bad 



temper. Belle threw a baseball at a 
Sports Illustrated photographer 
prior to an April 6 game in 
Cleveland. 

Belle hit Tom Tomsic after he 
took a picture of the Indian's slug- 
ger as he stretched near the 
Cleveland dugout Tomsic suffered 
a cut to the hand but did not file a 
complaint following the incident. 

A history of temperamental 
tirades haunts Belle. Most recently 
he was fined S50.000 by the com- 
missioner for his verbal assault 
against reporter Hannah Storm dur- 
ing last year's World Series. In 
1991 he was suspended for seven 
games after hitting a fan in the chest 
with a ball. 

No decision has been made by 
the commissioner as to how he will 
handle this latest incident. 
Coaching changes in 
the NRA... 

Raptors ax Malone, New Jersey 
trims Beard from staff. Hornets 
sting Bristow and Milwaukee may 
buck Dunleavy 

A plethora of coaching changes 
have taken place since the end of 
the NBA's regular season and more 



are rumored to be about to take 
place. 

Brendan Malone has been fired 
after one season as head coach of 
the expansion Toronto Raptors. 

"Philosophical differences" were 
cited by Raptor's General Manager 
Isaiah Thomas as the reason for 
Malone's dismissal Malone guided 
Toronto to a 21-61 record in its first 
season in the league. 

Assistant Coach Darrcll Walker 
has been tabbed to replace Malone. 

The New Jersey Nets fired Butch 
Beard on Monday. Beard posted 
identical 30-52 records each of the 
last two seasons with the team. The 
Nets finished this season by losing 
11 of its last 13 games 

No replacement has been named 
for Beard 

The Hornets and Allen Bristow 
announced Tuesday that a mutual 
agreement has been reached on a 
coaching change for next season. 

Bristow. the winningest coach in 
team history, posted a 41-41 record 
this season and failed to qualify for 
the playoffs. Last season he guided 
Charlotte to its first 50- win season. 

A search for a new head coach 
will begin immediately 



Unconfirmed repotU'Uy ESPN 
said that the Bucks will soon relieve 
Mike Dunleavy of his coaching 
duties in Milwaukee Dunleavy. 
who has four years remaining on an 
eight-year contract, may remain in 
some capacity in the front office 

Milwaukee finished the season a 
disappointing 25-57 this season. 
Dunleavy has a 107-221 record in 
four seasons at the helm for the 
Bucks. 

Rangers anxbush 
Orioles... 

Texas used a 16-run eighth 
inning to demolish Baltimore. 26-7, 
last Thursday. 1 lie 16-run output 
fell just one run short of the major 
league record Boston scored 17 
runs in one inning against Detroit in 
1953 The record for most runs in a 
game is 29. That record was set by 
the While Sox against the Kansas 
City A's in 1955. 

The Rangers faced three pitchers 
in the eighth inning which took 
nearly 55 minutes to play. Texas 
has 19 hits and collected 13 walks 
in the game. 



Good-bye Brook... you'll be missed 




Sometimes you just have to stop 
and wonder why. Why is it that 
those with an unselfish regard for 
humanity arc the first taken from 
us? Why is it that so many with 
bright futures and the ability to 
make a positive influence upon our 
world arc snatched away from us? 

Another episode of the "whys" 
hit once again late last week when 
Nebraska quarterback Brook 
Bernnger was killed in a plane 
crash near Lincoln, Neb. Berringer, 
a career-long backup to standout 



T o m m i e 
Frazier. played 
Jim bis rate lo per- 

fection. He 
tPOfter marched the 

sideline during 
each and every 
H|L 'Husker game 

I *€-Kd.en j us t waiting to 

/A# gel his chance. 

:-. . Finally. 

(Kfot^A^Td late in the 1994 

season, 
Berringer got 
the ultimate 
chance. With Fra/ier sidelined due 
to bloodclois in his leg, the consum- 
mate backup took the field. He 
stepped up and filled the role 
admirably He led the 'Huskers to 
seven consecutive wins, many of 
which were played with a collapsed 



lung. He got his chance and made 
the most of it. Berringer played an 
important role in Nebraska's quest 
for the first of what would eventual- 
ly become a pair of national cham- 
pionships. 

Bemnger's life wasn't all about 
football, however Yes, he was an 
outstanding athlete. He played both 
football and basketball in high 
school He was a man of true char- 
acter according to those who had 
the fortune of knowing him. The 
night of his death, Berringer was to 
have been the keynote speaker at a 
gathering of Christian athletes on 
the Nebraska campus. 

I never had the good fortune of 
meeting Bemnger, but by all indi- 
cations he was the type of guy any- 
one would want as bis best friend 
He enjoyed not only football but 



also hunting, fishing and a number 
of outdoor activities. He was a true 
sportsman in every sense of the 
word. A man of true character and a 
great outdoors man. 

It was a sad moment last 
Thursday night when the news of 
Berringer' s death was reported by 
ESPN, To be truthfully honest, I 
almost shed tears for the young man 
and his family Most of all I had to 
stop and ihink of the hardship that 
Bemnger's girlfriend must be fac- 
ing. Not only did she lose the love 
of her life, but she also lost her 
older brother. Tobey Lake was a 



passenger in the plane Berringer 
was flying. 

It seems that every time a feci 
good, almost too good to be true 
character graces the front page it is 
because of some unfortunate inci- 
dent, Why is it (hat those with an 
unselfish love of humanity always 
get stolen from us 9 Why is it that 
those with the greatest ability to 
make a positive impact upon our 
society arc taken before they can do 
so? 

Berringer was expected to be 
picked in the middle rounds of the 
National Football League draft that 



was conducted just two days after 
his death. No. he wasn't the caliber 
of player that gets picked in the first 
round and is awarded some out- 
landish sum of money He was. 
however, the type of player who 
could win games on sheer guts and 
determination The type of player 
that his teammates would rally 
around in a time of need The type 
of man that every man would have 
chosen to be his best friend if given 
the chance to choose. Sadly, those 
moments will never be witnessed 
by those of us who yearn for a true 
hero in the world of sports.

Whoa, what another excit- 
ing NFL draft for us "Drafiniks." 
Surprisingly enough, I was not 
drafted again this year I was a little 
off on my draft projections, mainly 
because 1 would have never 
guessed that (he New York Jets 
would have done the right thing 
and drafied Keyshawn Johnson. I 
was still able to call more first- 
round seleclions right than The 
Sporting News or Sports Illustrated. 
so maybe I'm getting belter Here is 
a quick look at some of the draft's 
high lights and low lights. 

Surprise pick of the draft: 
The Green Bay Packers with 
pick number 21 in the first 
round selected USC offensive tack- 
le John Michels The Packers aciu- 
ally drafted Michels ahead of two 
tackles thai rated higher Michels is 
a former defensive end with a mean 
streak a mile wide and the size 
(6*6, 282 lbs.) to back it up. This 
selection tells me the Packers must 
be worried about Aaron Taylor 
returning from bis second major 
knee injury, otherwise why would 
the team take such a gamble? 



Stupid pick or the draft: The 
Houston Oilers selecting 
Eddie George with pick num- 
ber 14 in the first round George, 
the running back from Ohio Slate 
who won the lleisman Trophy, is 
definitely first-round material, 
don't get me wrong there. The 
Oilers had their choice of almost 
every player in the draft at pick 
number 9 and traded down lo draft 
George. The Oilers already have 
Rodney Thomas who was a 1,000 
yard rusher last year as a rookie and

England 
Patriots draft- 
ing University 
of Arizona defensive end Tedy 
Bruschi in the third round. Scouts 
knocked Bruschi, saying he was loo 
slow to play linebacker and too 
small to play defensive end. 
Bmscbi is 6'1 and about 265 lbs 
(roughly the same sue as Charles 
Haley) and was one sack shy of set- 
ting the NCAA all-time record. The 
guy can flat out play the 
game and was one of 
the only players in the 
draft who could domi- 
nate a game. On 
lop of that he was 
the defensive MVP 
at the Hula Bowl. 
Bill Parcells, here is 
your next Lawrence 
Taylor. 

Moving up in 
the world: 
The Cincinnati 
Bengals. The Bengals 

drafted offensive tack- 
les Willie Anderson 
and Ken Blackmen and both will 
slari next year. On the defensive 
side of Ihe ball Jevon Langford 
from Oklahoma State will start at 
defensive end and Greg Meyers 
from Colorado State should - 1 . i n at 
safety Meyers is a tremendous ath- 
lete and is considered a coach on 
the field. The Bengals just keep 
adding quality pieces to their puz- 
lber one pick 

~2T~ 




Ki-Jana Carter is almost fully 
recovered from a knee injury, and 
the team already had a strong pass- 
ing game. Playing in a weak divi- 
sion will help end the Bengals' six- 
year playoff drought. 

From bad to worse: The 
Arizona Cardinals. The 
Cardinals have three defen- 
sive linemen and two running backs 
ihey cannot cut because of salary 
cap reasons, so what did the team 
draft with its first two picks? 
Defensive end Simeon Rice and 
running back Leeland McElroy 
Huh? Rice and McElroy are both 
great players that might help the 
team, but come on, is Buddy Ryan 
still running things down there 
Plus the team failed to make an 
effort lo address its quarterback 
problems 

For the most part, teams 
drafied quality players for 
depth and ended up with the 
players they wanted The 
Rams. Dolphins and 
Buccaneers were three 
teams that did excep- 
tionally well, while the 
Redskins followed 
Arizona's road lo 
suckville. Lawrence 
Phillips will be the 
Offensive Rookie of the 
year with the Rams and the 
previously mentioned Bruschi 
will capture the Defensive 
Rookie of the year honors. The 
disappointment of the draft to 
me was that no team took a 
chance on Tommie 
Frazier. He is the most successful 
quarterback in NCAA history and 
thai should be worthy of a shot at 
making a team somewhere, even if 
it is in Arizona.
