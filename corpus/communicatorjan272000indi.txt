Comedian Reno celebrates diversity 



In celebration of Diversit&gt;' Week, 
Women's Studies Is co-sponsoring a two-day 
event. Fob. 24 and 25, featuring comedic per- 
formance artist Reno, She has performed at 
the lincoln Center and off-Broadway and has 
been featured on HBO. 

Her short-form tragicomic essays 
have appeared on PBS. VII-1 and Comedy 
Central. Reno is among IS distinguished solo 
performers/ writers whose work will be pub- 
hshed in Theatre Communications Croup's 
"E.\rreme Exposure; An Antholog&gt;' of Solo 
Performance Texts from the Twentieth 

Reno's docucomedy, "Reno Finds Her 
Mom," will be shown Feb. 24 at 7 p.m. at the 
Cinema Center, 437 E. BerT&gt;- Sl It Is a Film 
written and produced by Reno In which she 
deals wldi the Issues of adoption and finding 
one's birih mother In a humorous way. 'The 
feature length documentary features appear- 
ances by Lily Tomlln and Mary "IVIer Moore. 

She will perform her new comedy 
show, -Reno Finds Her Mind," Feb. 25 at 8 
p.OL In IPFWi Williams Theatre. According to 
Linda Fon. director of Women's Studies, 
■Reno's comedy is full of social and political 
commentary." 

Fos said. -ThU woman talks about 



social and political issues from the tens o&lt; 
someone who is lesbian in our society. She 
does not do comedy for lesbians only, 
though. In fact, she doesn't bill that ivay 
because she Is who she is and she doesn't 
hide it. it's so much who she Is and part of her 
that she doesn't feel the need to bill thai way. 
It will be apparent from what she says.' 

Fox chose to bring Reno to campus 
because she says, "1 tell It was really Impor- 
tant to get a different kind of diverslt&gt;' repre- 
sented here. Diversitj' is diversitj- of a lot of 
different kinds and not Jusl gender, race, eth- 
nicity and social class, but also se.\ual orien- 
tation. This is a side that I think nc don't see 
at IPFW." 

According to Fox, "I do feel that she is 
a social critic and the fact that she happens to 
be a lesbian is a plus in terms of divenity 
issues."

that. She U a New Yorker and wheri-.'cr she 
visits, she Hnds things from the local scene

According to Fox, "Reno has some 
wonderful reviews. The Film is a serious topic 
treated semi -comically. It's a very' sensitively 
done film about this issue, hut very open," 

Both the film showing and the live 
comedy show are free to the public. Because 
Reno uses a lot of strong language in her com- 
edy, it Is Intended for mature audiences only. 



A recent proposal has recommended the 
expansion of the Memorial Coliseum. This expan- 
sion will include new modem padded seats to 
replace the old wooden ones, an arena capacitj' 
increase from 10,000 to 13,000, improved access 
for people with disabilities, renovated restrooms, 
three new high-speed elevators, two escalators 
and the addition of club seats and suites. The 
anchor from the battleship Indian will also be 
moved to a pavilion adjacent to Memorial Hall, 

The Memorial Coliseum was erected fifty 
years ago. The estimated cost of the proposed 
modeml/ation is S28 million while dte cost to 
build a brand new racilit&gt;' would be S80 to SlOO 
million. The renovation would be financed by 
earned revenues and property ta.v 

Many citizens of Fort Wajne have an opinion 
about w'hethcr or not this expansion should occur 
and many are taking action to see that their voic- 
es are heard. Two such individuals are right here 
on the IPFW campus, 

Agnes Auchtung, who works In the Career 
Services office, decided to start a petition oppos- 
ing (he Coliseum expansion. "1 heard on the news 
that anyone could go to the auditor's office and 
get a petition," she said. She got three petitions 
and received approximately forti' signatures of 
individuals opposing the expansion proposal. She 
said she decided to take action because "I didn't 



like the idea of them using propeny taxes to 
expand the Coliseum. I don't use the Coliseum 
that much and why should we have to pay for 
something we don't use? It's a business. Why 
should property owners have to pay for a 
business!" 

Like Auchtung, Ann Souligny Brown, who Is 
the Collegiate Connection coordinator in the 
School of Education, also h.id a strong opinion 
about the proposed expansion of the Memorial 
Coliseum. She, too, decided to get a petition. Her 
husband. Randy Brown. Is the General Manager of 
Memorial Coliseum. "While I'm not officially con- 
nected to the Coliseum," she said, "1 do have an 
interest In the continued success of the Coliseum, 
not only to support my husband, but for the good 
of the communitj." 

According to Brown, "The economic impact 
of the Memorial Coliseum is slgnincani. The trade 
shows, concerts and sporting events attract peo- 
ple to Fort Wayne where they spend their monej' 
at loc^l restaurants, hotels and businesses. In 
order to remain competitive and plan for the 
future, the e.xpansion is needed. The expansion 
will not only allow for larger venues to come to 
Fort Wayne, but will improve access for disabled 
patrons, add restrooms. more comfortable seat- 
ing, additional concession stands and provide 
greater ne.xibilit&gt;- in scheduling." 

According to Brown, "The petition drive 
ended Thursday, Jan, 20 and the auditor's office 
Is now verifying the signatures, but we anticipate 
the opposition will win the remonstrance drive."

Students possess ability to m ake an impact on university community 




According to Joe Schroeder, 
student bod}- president, IPSCA elec- 
Cinni are coming up In about three 
weeki. In order to hive an election, 
one needs both people to run for 
the ^'artety of offices and people to 
vote for (he candidates. 

Although this Is a simple con- 
cept, we at The Communicator have 
noticed thai this poses a huge 
problem. 

For the last thtee yean, the 
number of people who have run for 
a position and the number of peo- 
ple who have voted for a candidate 
have been extremely low. 

We do rot want to repeat the 
numbers, but In order to give you 
newcomers a taste of how low the 
turnout was (and some of you who 
may have forgotten) we have to go 
back in time. 

The first e.\ampie that comes 
to mind Is the number of people 
who ran for president last year. 
There were merely two individuals 
out of approximately 11,000 stu- 
dents who ran for the presidency.

Letter to Jhe Editor 



A difficult commute 



1 am a biolog&gt; major here at IPFW. This 
spring begins my fourth semester on this cam- 
pus. Ch-erail, I would have to say that I am happy 
with my choice lo attend this university. The 
faculty here is helpful, the classroom experience 
Is well-rounded and I feel that 1 am getting a 
very solid education. TTiis is encouraging when 
one considers that this Is a commuter campus in 
which the student body Is somewhat transient 

At this school, everyone must drive, there Is 
no on-campus housing, as I am sure all of you 
are aware. I drive from Auburn ever&gt; day to get 
here, I would consider my 30-minutc dally trek 
to be moderate compared to the one hour com- 
mutes that some of my fellow classmates must 
endureonadajlybasis. When one considers this 
information, certain questions arise concerning 
an entire student body on the road in had 

On the thineenih of January, there was a 
sheet of ice covering the roads In the morning. 
The roads were, to put it mildly, dangerous. On 
thai panicuiar morning 1 had an analytical 
chemistry lab that was to meet at 9;00 a.m. For 
those of you who are not science majors, I will 
point out that skipping lab is, for all intents and 
purposes, not an option. This doesn't c\en bring 
into focus the fact that two of my professors 
hand out sign-up sheets in lecture to ensure that 
we are attending. 

My opinion of this practice notwithstand- 
ing, it becomes vital for me to make it to class 
when classes are scheduled. I know that other 
students are in the same position that I am. We 
don't get the luxury of deciding that we don't 
"want" to drive into school without affecting our 
standiog in class. 

Now, 1 know that there is someone on cam- 
pus who makes the judgment concerning delays 
or cancellations of school. I must ask what his 
priorities are, because it certainly is NOT the 
more than 10.000 individuals who drive the 
roads to get here for class. This last Thursday, I 
passed two accidents in which ambulances were 
present. 

Does one of my classmates have to die 
before wc can get a little personal consideration 
here? Do I have to die before my good friend 
Mike can stay home in IDecatur when the roads 
are so bad that people are sliding across inter- 
sections? 

The way 1 see it, the system under which we 
are operating is completely unacceptable. Docs 
anyoneremembcrthe bad snow we had last win- 
ter over Christmas break? Did anyone stop to 
wonder why campus was closed for only one 
day? The rest of the civilized universe was shut 
down for the better part of a week- 
Even though classes were not In session, 
there were people with families driving here to 
get to work. I realized that the administration 
here likes to remain Invisible on this campus, as 
they hide In that black hole in Ketller, but 1 feel 
that It is time that we see some action from that 
unseen appendage that wields all the power here 
on campus. Some action that might actually ben- 
efit the student population, something that 
might actually cause us to say "thank you." 



Consideration for others 



by Erika Nordblom, News Editor 



1 was eating alone in the 
food court at Glenbrook Mall a 
few days ago when [ noticed a 
blind woman searching for a 
place to sit and eat. She spoke 
softly to the beautiful black lab 
that was her seeing eye dog as 
she moved towards a table near 
me. As 1 ate my meal, I observed 
the behavior of the mall patrons 
toward the woman. Several indi- 
viduals stared at her rudely as 
they walked past her table. As I 
gazed on, I was struck by the 
reaiizaUon of the sense of Isola- 
tion this woman must Uve-in due 
to her lack of sight and the fact 
that she Is probably treated like 
that on a dally basis. 

Every Individual feels a 
sense of aUenacJon at some point 
In his or her life; we all feel that 
we get D-eated poorly by others 
and that we are isolated from the 
rest of society every once in a 
while. Many people experience It 
on a dally basis. But Imagine also 
living in a worid of perpetual 
darkness, as this blind woman 
does. One's sense of Isolation and 
the feeling associated with being 
treated differently would esca- 
late. Actually, I've noticed that 
anyone In our society who devi- 
ates from the norm In any way, 
whether they are blind, obese or 
have purple hair, gets treated 
differently and I imagine the 
sense of isolation In society is 
great. 

I used to work in a coffee 
shop and I remember a man in a 
wheelchair who ordered coffee 
from me one day. He could not 
use his liand very well, so he had 
to ask me to take his cup of cof- 
fee over to the table for him. I 
remember thinking to myself, 
'Just treat him as 1 would any 
other individual." 1 didn't want 
to overcompensate hj being 
overly helpful and, in turn, seem 
as though 1 were patronizing 
him. 1 also wanted to be helpful, 
though. In the end, the situation 
turned out fine, but I realized 
that it would have been so easy 



treat everyo 



n diffcrenliy thar 






noticed that when some- 
one is different, many people 
simply avoid contact with that 
person. Or. as I've mentioned 
earlier, many people act unnatu- 
rally nice and end op patroniz- 
ing the person. 

For the most part, 1 believe 
that people's Intentions are good 
when they interact with Oiose 
who are different in some waj-. 
TTielr reactions Just seem to stem 
from ■feeling.- uncomfortable 
around such Individuals. In 
other words, they simply don't 
know how to acL 

The answer to that Is very 
easy. Just treat people who you 
see as different the same way 
you would treat everyone else. Of 
course, that opens up another 
can of worms because 1 think 
most people treat one another 
pteitj- shabbily in our society. 
I'm talking about our day to day 
interactions with people who are 
similar to ourselves, not to men- 
tion those with differences. 

I&gt;:l me conclude by telling 
you what I decided to do when I 
noticed the blind woman in the 
mall who got me to thinking 
about all of this stuff In the first 
place. I decided to go over and 
talk to the woman because, 
whether she was blind or not, 
most people could benefit from 
being reached out to by another 
penon, I went over and asked 
her about her dog. 

She seemed to truly appreci- 
ate the friendly gesture and told 
me that she was gtad that I had 
come to speak with her. It rein- 
forced mv Idea that there is no 
one on Earth who couldn't bene- 
fit from the kindness of a 
stranger. Oh, and one more 
thing. You can really meet some 
Interesting people who will 
enrich your life if you lake the 
time to reach out to others. I 
think I've been on this soapbox 
long enough. 



What to do with EUan 




by Chadd Pierce, Staff Writer 

1 am having a little bit of trou- 
ble grasping this whole issue with 
Elian Gonzales. He is some kid 
found as the result of a wreck. The 
boat with which he and his family 
were trying to escape from Cuba 
capsized. Most media are not exact- 
ly focusing on that. It seems that 
there are people who arc really 
concerned about whether this boy 
should be mailed back to his HOME 
country or noL "His mom and 
other family members were trying 
to rescue him from the shackles of 
communism,- one might say. Most 
likely, this is veiy tiue. The prob- 
lem Is the fact that we, as a coun- 
try, have him, and his Cuban father 
wants him back. This Is where I 
would have expected it to end, as 
we all move our focus to the next 
horrific school shooting, but no. 
His American greot uncle wants to 
keep him. So we kept him. 

Last time I checked, the family 
food chain listed great uncles sig- 
nificantly lower than fathers. 
Father trumps anything below 
mother and there Is no mother. I 
would not even bring up where 
father ranks In regard to the nation 
(sorry. It beats a pair of U.S.'s an&gt; 
day.) So, what is the problem, here? 
Eihnocentrism. Okay, that is not 
the only problem, but that is the 
bulk of what 1 am hearing in the 
"reasons Elian should stay" catego- 
r)- on Family Feud. "One hundred 
people were surveyed..." This 
whole communism equals bad, cap- 
italism equals good, concept is real- 
ly Immature. Twisting some little 
kid's life Jtist to please the anti- 
commie American Nationalist who 
wants to prove he is greater than 
any country who docs not accept 
dcmocrncv. Is sick and it Is the 
work of a Nazi's mind. The funnj 
thing is, I might have become Mr. 
Red to some after that comment, 
but it is reall) sad to see that this 
itiy thinks we are so big and 






right, r 



how much God and 
to get us. (For the record, 
"Communism" is an economic the- 
or&gt;-, not a political one.) Who cares 
what country this kid Is from? Who 
cares how he go there? All that is 
Important is that he has a parent 
that wants him back home. Here is 
not, home. This policeman of the 
world cliche Is really starting to 
become a self-fulfllling prophecy. 
The VS. hates Cuba. Kidnapping a 
kid Is not exactly going to help our 
relationship. Check this one out, 
new legislation to grant Elian 
Instant citizenship! 

This Is not totally unheard of

ably ihould have for John Lennon. 



tool,, but in this case, it is really get- 
ting a bit out of hand. Majbc some- 
body can write a letter to this 
paper with my name on It e.vplain- 
Ing the driving force behind these 
parades, these trips to Disneyland, 
these television blurbs. How 
screwed up are we willing to make 
this kid? Of course he Is going to 
want to stay. After all that, you 
would have lo be blind to tempta- 
tion to not want to stay! This kid is 
already ripe to join some sort of 
rebel group when he gctf to be 
about twelve. What is lnhat these 
protesten and lawmaken and dis- 
tant, unacquainted relatives want? 
To win! 

Sometimes I really question 
Che motives of Mr. Bill and the leg- 
islators on Capital Hill. My opinion: 
this kid should have been shipped 
right back to Cuba the minute we 
found him. That Is what we do to 
thousands at a time, all the time. 
Why is he so different? 1 suppose 
we need one more immigrant for 
John Rocker to whine about. 

Being just about as political as 
1 can be, I have a simple time look- 
ing at this. Talking about It with 
some people Is like to'ing to tell my 
step-father why I dislike the idea of 
the draft. I never get far without 
him yelling and cursing at my lack 
of support for the country. 

1 recently received this incred- 
ible c-mall. It talked about a com- 
pany with hundreds of cmplo3'ces 
(I cannot find It, but it really lies in 
here, so I will go from memory) 
and described overiapping statis- 
tics of criminal acts, charges and 
convictions for most of the mem- 

Among the proven accusations 
Here a number of spousal abuse 
incidents, fraud, theft, drugs and 
many of them have such records. 
Their histories are so tainted that 
thcj cannot even get credit cards. 

Well, after a length; descrip- 
tion of the sins of this "eompanv ," 
it finally divulged in the letter that 
it was the United Slates Congress. 
This applies in this situation In a 
way that is very political. Why do 
we let these wife-beating, drug- 
abusing, money laundering, bank- 
rupt old men decide what is best 
for a child. 

We might want to take another 
look at our own situation If THAT Is 
the only deciding factor and right 
now, I cannot figure out any other 
reason as to why the kid is still 

Oh, was 1 talking about a six- 
year-old kid! I guess 1 got com- 
pletely wTapped up in everything 
else and forgot why I was arguing 
In the first place.

Should South Carolina be allowed to fly the battle flag? 



Recently, the controversy in South I 
Carolina has resurfaced over flying the I 
Confederate flag along with the American I 
flag at their Statehouse. People have differ- I

to them; therefore, there is a lot of contro- I 
versy. We decided to ask some of the stu- 1

flag are. They were also asked about their I

Viral STDS are on the rise in today's society 



by Michele Kadenko- 
Monirian, R.N.. 
Guesl Writer 



This U the second ot a (mo 
pan scries on STDs. The fint 
pari discussed bacterial STDs, 
while [his part uill focus on 
viral STDs. 

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 
i)pc 2 and the common cold 
sore virus (HSV 1) can be com- 
mon sources of genital herpes, 
one ij'pe of viral STD. 
Symptoms of the first episode 
can appear two lo ten days 
after exposure and last up to 
tno to three weeks. Up 10 
eighl&gt;' percent of those with 

because they never developed 
symptoms or did not recognize 
them. Symptoms usually begin 
as an itching or burning sensa- 
tion; pain In the legs, buttocks 
or genital area; vaginal dis- 
charge; or a feeling of pressure 



In the abdomen. After a few 
days, lesions appear which 
begin as small red bumps that 
soon develop into blisters 
which become painful open 
sores. The sores become crust- 
ed In a few days and heal with- 
out scarring. Lesions can 
occur Inside the vagina, the 
cervix or in the urinaij- pas- 
sage of both men and women. 
During the primao' episode of 
genital herpes, fever, 

headache, muscle aches, 
painful or difficult urination 
and snoUen glands In the 
groin area can occur. Once a 
person has become infected 
with herpes, symptoms can 
recur at anytime. New sores 
do not always erupt, but small 
amounts of the \irus may be 
shed at or near sites of the 
original Infection. Recurrent 
episodes are usually not as 
severe as the primary out- 
breai^ Many recognize only 
one or two recurrences in a 



lifetime. There is no cure, but 
andviral medication can short- 
en the tlrsl episode and sup-

some warts disappear while 
others grow Into large masses.

There Is no cure for genital 
warts and treatment is s&gt;Trp-

rise. Those most at risk are 



indMduali with multiple sex 
partners, IV drug users and 
individuals who received 
blood products before 1992, 
Infection can occur after one 
sexual encounter. Because it Is 
a virus, there Is no cure. Often 
the disease goes undetected or 
mimics less serious Illnesses, (t 
Is not until slgnlHcani liver 
damage occurs that it is com- 
monly diagnosed. Powerful 
drugs have recently been 
approved by the FDA that can 
possibly eradicate the virus, 
but not all Individuals 
respond. A vaccine Is available 
for Hepatitis B. but not C 

HIV/ AIDS Is also on the rise 
in the United States and new 
cases are disproportionately 
afTectjng minorities, African 
Americans and Hispanlcs rep-

Globally, over 75 percent of 
Infections occurred from het- 



erosexual conocL if an indi- 
vidual Is not tested for HIV, It 
can remain undetected for 
years until it progresses Into 
AIDS. Medication combina- 
tions can delay progression of 
the HIV infection to AIDS. 
Still, there is no cure.

'Angela's Ashes': Frank McCourt's struggles of life in Ireland 



by Todd Hamm 
Staff Wriler 



In "Angela's Ashes" an 
unimaginable poverty circum- 
vents all else. One's own trou- 
bles seem meager in compari- 
son. The mo\ic is told from the 
perspective of Frank McCourl, 
the eldest of Malachy and 
Angela McCourt's eventual 
sc\'en children. It Is based on 
his memoir of growing up a 
miserably poor Irish Catholic. 

It begins tvhen the family 
is sail In New York and Frank Is 
five. He is pla)ed bj' a \er&gt;' 
Alfalfa-like young actor, com- 
plete with tittle boy bull dog 
face and unruly black hair. 

The family does not stay 
in America long, however. 
When his sister Margaret dies 
at only a few months of age, 
Angela is bedridden with mis- 
ery, and cannot care for her 
children. A cousin sends them 
back to Ireland, where the)' 



take up residency In Umerlck. 

Margaret was Malachy's 
favorite child. Because of her, 
he had stopped drinking. In 
Limerick, Malachy resumes 
drinking and is unable to get a 
job. The family Rne.^ on the 
dole (welfare), which Malachy 
squanders on the drink. He 
comes home stumbling, 
singing patriotic songs and 
demands Frank and his broth- 
er line up like soldiers and 
sivear they'll die for Ireland. 
Frank's twin brothers, who are 
still toddlen, die within weeks 
of arriving In Ireland. Malachy 
refuses to beg. 

It is beneath him. It is up 
to Angela to provide. She man- 
ages to rent an apartment with 
what money 'Klalachy gives 
her. The apartment is at the 
end of a lane of like tenements 
and families. It is perpetually 
raining. Frank and his brother, 
also named Malachy, are 
always soaked. The state of the 



tenements is atT(x:ious: color- 
less and drear)', with heat and 
light provided by candles and 
a solitar}' Tircplace, tor which 
the family has no money for 
fuel. Sewage is poured into the 
street outside their door. They 
sleep together under old coats 
In a flea -Infested mattress, 
' Emily Watson, as Angela, 
has (he same captivating 
naivete as in her role In the 
horrid film "Breaking the 
Waves." She Is bitten weet, a 
tragic beaut)', consigned to 
frayed, secondhand clothes, 
begging for the newspaper 
wrapped scraps at the door of 
the Catholic rector)' among a 
mass of like women. 

When Frank sees his 
mother beg, he turns away. He 
has none of Malachy's stub- 
born pride. Nonetheless, he is 
ashamed. He is likewise 
ashamed when he realizes the 
state of his mother's relation- 
ship with her cousin Laman 



Criffm; they sleep together. 
Laman has allowed Angela and 
her brood to live at his place 
for no rent. It is at this time 
that Malachy has gone to work 
In an English factor)- while the 
Germans slaughter the former 
English workers. 

He leaves. Intent on earn- 
ing respectable wages, but 
within a week of his departure, 
it Is clear he has abandoned 
his family. Frank and his 
brothers are devastated to fmd 
no Friday telegram containing 
Malachy's wired wages. They 
persevere. 

All Frank wants to do is to 
be a man, work an honest Job 
and bring homo the wages to 
his mother. He and his broth- 
ers have been attending 
Lcam)''s boys school since they 
came to Ireland, but from the 
time he is around 10, he is far 
more interested in working 
odd jobs and cutting class with 
his friend Paddy for forages in 



the country where they would 
steal green apples and raw' 
milk from a farmer's orchards 

When he is 16, Frank 
becomes a telegram delivery 
boy. Many of the people he 
delivers telegrams to tip him. 
He is able to support his moth- 
er and brothers somewhat, but 
the job more or less leads him 
to his first love encounter. He 
is seduced bj' a girl his age who 
is said to have the consump- 
tion and so Is desperate tor 
\o\e. 

They meet many times 
w'hen Frank delivers her fami- 
ly's weekly telegram. One day, 
however, a woman he docs not 
know answers the door and 
tells him she has gone to the 
sanitarium. Frank goes to her 
funeral. He is distraught. Her 
loss is a pain for which he has 
no previous experience. Later, 
he has his Tirst pint, gels 
drunk, comes home singing 



the same songs his father used 
to sing and Hnds his mother 
waiting up for him. They get 
into an appropriate argument 
within which Frank accuses his 
mother of being a slui and 
then slaps her. 

His life crumbling around 
him, Frank takes refuge In his 
church, under the statue of St. 
Francis. An understanding 
priest consoles him and 
coerces him Into purging his 
mind of ever)-ihing he Is 
ashamed of, especially the fear 
condemned his ■ 



lovei 



o hell. 



The priest absolves him 
and gels him to feel his trou- 
bles are much less oppressive 

Aftenvards, with ihc 
insight of one of his teachers 
and by helping himself to a 
dead employer's purse, he is 
able to afford the trip back to 
America,

Spicer shines on and off the court 



by Le'Kresia Outlaw, 
Slaff Writer 



The name Randy Spicer It 
synonymous with success at 
IPFW. A four-year starter on 
this year's basketball team, 
Spicer is much more than Just 
the team's starting point 
guard, the student government 
comptroller and second on the 
school's All-Time assist record. 

As a role model for his 
peers, Randy spends a major 
pan of his dme in student 
govemmenl. During his 
tenurc,"he has been able to 
meet new people and 
participate In a plethora of 
different activities within the 
university which have resulted 
in a great network of 
opportunities for him. 

Spicer choose to come to 
[PFW not only because he was 
recruited for basketball, but 
also to receive an Indiana 
Unlversit)' "Big !0- education, 
which is very Important to 
him. 

Being Randy Spicer means 
being dependable. People can 
count on him no matter what, 
and being there for others tops 
his list of priorities. 

Being a basketball player 
at IPFW Is no easy task, 
however, Spicer accepts his 
role as team leader and moti- 
vator along with other duties 
that come with being the 
team's "door general.' 

"H involves leadership, 
teamwork and becoming more 
experienced by being put into 
different situations," Spicer 
said. 

When people look at the 
=30 Jersey, Spicer wants 
people 10 see not only a 
student athlete, but also a 

He has accomplished and 
Improved many things here at 
IPFW and will continue to do 
so In his path of life. 

Basketball has helped him 
become more motivated and 
more experienced in dealing 
with different situations. 

Three people whom Spicer 
said he has turned to in those 



situations have been his mom. 
dad and God. All three play a 
major role in Splcer's life. 

He looks up to his father 
who is the number one reason 
why basketball Is his favorite 
sporL His father is very 
supportive of him and attends 
cveo' game, even If they're 

Splcer's mother has 
inspired him to move tow-ard 
the best things in life. In limes 
of frusQ^tlon. Spicer said, "She 
was alwajs there to give the 
advice.- 

~You can do all things 
through Chrisr said Spicer, 
who believes that God will 
ne\'er gi\'e you more than you 
can handle. 

One day. Spicer would like 
to be able to support his 
family without them ever 
being financially in need. 

Because basketball is veo' 
lime-consuming, it necessi- 
tates having one's priorities in 

Spicer does this by trying 
to have understanding 
professors, taking advantage 
of his time, making sacrifices 
and figuring out what's most 
Important to him: his team and 
the student body he represents 



r: 



white in olTlce. 

Spicer even speaks a little 
French. However, there are 

some things at which IPFWs 
point guard does not excel. 

One area which Spicer 
said he would like to Improve 
includes his 'dancing skills.' 

HonCTw, Splcor's mcncs 
on Ihe dance floor do not com- 
pare to his most oitonass- 
ing moment. 

'I was a junior in high 
school and I had to give a 
speech in front of a lot of 
middle school students about 
sportsmanship. The occasion 
was like the Olyinplcs where 
everyone wore the colors of 
the countT&gt;' that they were 
representing. I was the one 
who would fun around the 
crack with a torch. I was all 
prepared for my speech; I even 
put the speech in my pocket in 
case of an accident." Spicer 
said. "However, I ended up 
changing my pants, so when I 
went to say my speech, 
everything had erased from 
my memory and all I could say 
was, 'Sportsmanship is good.' " 

This negathe event had a 
positive impact on him. Spicer 
is now able to speak In front of 



forward lo giving speeches. 

Former head basketball 
coach. John Williams Is 
Splcer's cousin. 

•Coach Williams allowed 
me 10 do a lot of dilTerent 
activities; he didn't Just focus 
all on basketball.- 

"Acadcmlcs in the previ- 
ous years weren't his (Coach 
Williams) fault. He did more 
than a llttic bit to help his 
players. He cared and shcnved 
great concern.' said Spicer. 

"Head Coach Doug Noll 
has a winning attitude. He 
pushes the team and gets more 
out of them than what they 
thought they had. Coach Noll 
is fair, challenging and dedi- 
cated," Spicer said. 

During conditioning, Noll 
would make all the guards run 
(he mile in 5 minutes 4S 
seconds, and Randy didn't 
think he could do It at all. 
However, before the 
pre-season opened, he was 
able to run the mile In S min- 
utes and 17 seconds. 

"My goal is to win the 
National Championship. The 
basketball team hasn't done as 
well as they hoped lo; 
however, the opportunity still 
looms there and they can 



-Assistant Coach 
Lawrence Jordan. former 
All-Amerlcan, was the best 
point guard to come through 
1PF\V,- Spicer said. 

Aaron "The Dishman" 
Ishman Is a senior for IPFVVs 
men's basketball team. He b 
also Splcer's best friend. 

Ishman has been with 
Spicer since his freshman year. 
"He's been someone that I can 
count on for whatever the 
reason may be," said Ishman. 

Spicer is a very Inspiring 
person. He says to all Incoming 
students at IPFW, Take advan- 
tage of every' opportunity that 
comes iheir way and look for 
things because they're out 

His strong work ethic pro- 
motes living every' day to the 
fullest. -If what you did 
yesterday still looks big to 
you," Spicer said, "then you 
haven't done much today.'

In Wilson's senior 
ye^r, he led the Redskins 
to a 02 state ranking and 
was very grateful lo have 
been a part of that suc- 
cess. "I was fortunate to 
be on a great team. I 
learned a lot from Coach 
Miller.' 

Wilson, who is a \er&gt;' 
laid back person, takes 
collegiate baseball seri- 
ously. "It's a team game. I 
go about my business and 
lead by example,' said 
Wilson. 

TTiat goes for both on 
and off the field. Wilson 
currently has a GPA lin- 
gering just over 3.S. 

-Head Coach Billy 



Gcmon puts a major 
emphasis on study tables 
and academics," Wilson 

The baseball team 
had the second highest 
combined GPA of all ath- 
letic teams here at IPFW. 

"I take the classroom 
seriously. TTie chances of 
being drafted arc slim and 
then the chances of even 
making It professionally 
are slimnter than that, so 
it's really important to me 
to get m&gt;- degree,' said 
Wilson. 

'Collegiate baseball is 
my life, I love It more than 
anything I've ever loved." 
Wilson said. "[ know that 
when If s over with, it will 
hurt more than any- 



thing." 

When asked about 
the life skills that baseball 
and Coach Gcmon have 
instilled in him, Wilson 
cited 'patience, disci- 

"These last two years, 
I've never worked harder. 
It's important to me to 
achle\-e my goals." 

Wilson's personal 
goal is something he 
striies to achieve ever)' 
day. "When I practice, 1 
must give 100 percent of 
what I have, no matter 



One thing that 
Wilson has tried to 
improve Is defense, "I've 
always been a good hiiicr. 
HoH-ever, last &gt;ear I onl&gt;' 
had eight errors in over 
200 attompu." 

Wilson has had many 
inspirations in his life, 
none greater than his 
father. "My dad was my 
coach from 5 to IS. 
Basically, he taught me 
evcrj' thing 1 know." 

"He has always been 
my biggest fan and only 
missed a handful of 



games when I ^vas playing 
JUCO at Vlncennei,- said 
Wilson. 

Wilson Is quick to 
point out that the thing 
that makes this team so 
great Is team chemistry. 
"It's a lot better than last 
year and Ccrnon makes 
that possible,* Wilson 
said. Thankfully, most of 
the guys arc returning 
and we're really close." 

The team attitude is 
portrayed by an analog}' 
to the Sequoia tree, the 
world's largest living 



If a Sequoia tree 
jiood alone, It would top- 
ple over in the wind 
because its roots arc only 



The way the Sequoias 
stay together is by inter- 
locking their roots and 
forming a stand. 

Wilson ttuy be just 
one of those roots, but put 
him in his uniform with 
27 le.immates and this Is 
going to be one strong

Men's basketball team drops pair of conference games 



Las[ week the men's bas- 
ketball team hosted two con- 
ference games against two of 
the tougher teams in the GLVC. 

Thursday night. Northern 
Kentucky (11-2 overall, 6-1 
GLVC) came w loivn to play 
the Dons. 

The nnit half was close 
behind some good defense on 
both sides of the court. 
Trailing by 11. IPFW finished 
the half with a spectacular 
allcy-oop from Benji Gibbs 
which was thrown down with 
force bj' Michael Akanni to go 
Into halftime down by 9. 

Dave Meshberger, who 
finished the game with 6 

opened the second half with a 
hy-up for the Dons. Then the 
guards from NKU took over, 
penetrating into the heart of 
the defense for good looks at 
jumpers and dishing out to the 
open man outside the arc for 
the open 3-pointers. They did 
not miss either, as NKU shot 
nearly 65 percent In the sec- 
ond half and IPFW only shot a 
dismal 37 percent. 

"We were playing a 'no 



help, no cover" defense i , . _ 
vent them from hitting the 
three," IPFW Head Coach Doug 
Noll said, 'but Northern 
Kentuck&gt;- did a great job and 
found the weakness In ihe 
middle of our spread-out 
defense." 

Northern Kentucky then 
wentonal3-2run toputlPFW 
down by as manj' as 24 points 
and that sealed their way to a 
92-74 victory. 

Leading the way In 
Northern Kentucky's decisive 
victory was Craig Con ley, who 
finished the game with 21 
points while shooting 8-10 
from the field and 5-7 from the 
line. The sharpshooter for NKU 
in the second half, guard Brian 
Lawhon, finished the game 3-S 
from behind the arc and 
scored 11 points respectively. 

[PFW's leading scorers in 
the loss were forward Nick 
Wise, who finished the game 
with 16 points; fonvard 
Michael Akanni, 13 points; and 
guards Steve Griffin and Randy 
Spicer, each with 1 1 points. 

Hoping to bounce back 
from their disappointing loss 
on Thursday, the Dons played 
host to the University of 
indianapohs (9-6 overall, S-4 
GLVC). 

Unfortunately for the 



Dons, their poor second half of 
shooting on Thursday carried 
over to the first half against U 
of 1. Shooting only 8 for 29 
from the field, including 2 for 

11 from behind the arc, the 
Dons finished the half 27 per- 
cent from the Held and went 
into the locker rooms down by 

12 at halftime. 

As the game resumed in 
the second halt, the Dons 
broke out of their ihooling 
slump. However, U of I was also 
on fire. IPFW got Ihe game 
down to single digits for the 
majoritj' of the second half, led 
by the spectacular 25-poini 
performance of Senior guard 
Griffin, making small runs. The 
Dons shot 53 percent in the 
second half, including 7 of 17 
three- pointers. Everj' time the 
Dons seemed to gain momen- 
tum, Indianapolis had an 
answer. They shot a sizzling 
65 percent from the field to 
keep IPFW from getting too 
close to striking distance. 

"Sometimes you work so 
hard to get back in a game,' 
said Noll. -We had it tied at 5S- 
55 and I felt that my starters 
needed a break, so I made 
some substitutions, but the 
subs weren't sharp right off 
the bench and we were back 
down by 6." 



The places Indianapolis 
hurt the ttons the most were 
from the line and on the glass. 
U of I made as many tree 
throws as IPFW attempted, fin- 
ishing the game 23 of 33 from 
the line. Many of those fi-ee 
throws were created b&gt;- second 
chance points from rebounds. 
Indianapolis out-rebounded 
IPFW 42 to 30. Tivclve of those 
42 were pulled down by U of 
I's Chris Martin. That was 
enough lo catapult 
Indianapolis to vit-ior&gt;'. 91-79. 
Peek performers for U of I 
were Martin, who had a dou- 
ble-double with IS points and

Qui, 



Davidson, scoring 16 poii. 

8 for 9 shooting from the line: 
and Andy Fosier, who scored 
15 points on 8 for 1 1 from the 
line. 

"With a new program and 
coaching staff, we can't expect 
10 gel the calls, w hich may par- 
tially e\plain why we aren't 
getting to the line as much as 
the opposition," Coach Noll 
said, "it's like if Michael Jordan 
were still playing and he was 
up against a rookie. Who do 
you think would get the calls!" 

Out ot the 9 players 
Indianapolis put into the 
game, 6 of them scored In dou- 
ble tlgures.
