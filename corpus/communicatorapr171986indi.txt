Loan forms available 

Students planning to apply for a Guaranteed Student Loan for the 1986-87 
academic year are being urged by the IPFW Financial Aid Of rice lo file the 
Financial Aid Form (FAF) for 1986-87, if they have not already filed one. 
Guaranteed Student Loans are B percent interest loans that students may apply 
for through their own bank or credit union. Repayment on the principal and 
interest are deferred until after graduation as long as the student carries at 
least six credit hours each semester. 

The GSL program will be subject to the same verification procedures that 
are required for the Pell Grant program and Pell Grant eligibility for each 
student must be determined before a GSL can be processed. Filing the FAF 
will satisfy the verification requirements and includes filing for the Pell Grant 
with a single form. The Financial Aid Forms (FAF) are available in the 
Financial Aid Office, Kettler 109, 

Leasing classes offered 

Tom Keltey Buick, in cooperation with GMAC and IPFW, is offering in- 
structional classes on ear leasing. The program has been set up through the 
Student Affairs Administration as a service lo students graduating from IP- 
FW. Specific information regarding classes will be announced. 



Grads to be honored 



May grads from the department of supervision will get a send-off from 
supervision faculty and alumni at Snickerz Comedy Bar, Wednesday, 8 to 10 
p.m. Grads are urged to pick up tickets from !he supervision office.

outstanding seniors. For more information, contact Shirley Rickert in the 
supervision department. 

Engineers compete 

This year's Mini-Baja Race for the Midwest Region of the Society of 
Automotive Engineers is being held May 30 and 31 at Houghton, Michigan. This 
is a two day event in which students from their respective schools compete 
with cars they have designed and built. 

The cars are one man, four wheeled, recreational vehicles that resemble 
miniature dune buggys. The cars are judged in the areas of design, safety, 
marketability, performance, handling, and endurance. The endurance race is 
the most grueling as last year's race saw only eight of the 28 entries still run- 
ning at the completion of the race. This is the first year IPFW students will 
participate in the competition. All students who would like to be a member of 
the pit crew, race learn, or just want to cheer at the race, contact Don 
McAleece in Neff Hail, room 360G, to make reservations.

WHERE AMERICA 



Search for 
new chancellor 
continues 

By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 

Managing Editor 

Despite rumors lo the contrary, Ihe process of selecting an IPFW chancellor is 

"moving," according to Joanne Lantz, an IPFW chancellor search and screen 

member. 

Lantz, also chair of the department of psychological sciences, was addressing 
questions Michael Downs, assistant professor political science, askedat the IPFW 
Facultv Senate meeting, Monday- 
Downs was questioning the progress the committee is making and the progress 
President Steven Beering and President John Ryan are having in trying to in- 
terview the final candidates. Beering is president of Purdue University, and Ryan 
is president of Indiana University. 

According lo a memorandum sent to all IPFW faculty and staff members last 
week from Donald Brown, chairman of the Chancellor Search and Screen Com- 
mittee. Ihe committee narrowed the list of candidates down to four finalists, all 
from outside Indiana Brown said the presidents would then interview Ihose 
candidates and decide who to invite to visit IPFW and the Fort Wayne community. 
"While we do not know what the schedule for the visils will be," said Brown in his 
memorandum, "it is hoped Ihey can take place before commencement in May." 

Brown again confirmed the goal remains the same: to have the candidates visit 
IPFW beforeschool recesses for Ihe summer. 

Tuesday, Brown said Ihe candidates may not be able to visit IPFW before school 
recesses for the summer. 

"The original goal was to try to have Ihem (the linalisls) visit before school is 
out," Brown said Tuesday. "Everyone wants that lo be true, but it may not be 
possible." 

When questioned if the committee is postponing the search process until fall. 
Brown replied, "Not lo my knowledge." To do so, according lo Brown, would mean 
that the search would have lo be reopened because the present four finalists would 
have to renew current contracts so as to be exployed next fall. 
"As far as I know, they're working as fast as they can," continued Brown. 
However, Brown did indicate the search would take longer than originally 
planned. 

Brown was unable lo say whether IPFW would start the 1986-87 academic year 
with a new chancellor. "I don't know. These things do take time," said Brown. 

The candidates have remained interested, though, according to Brown. He 
explained that if, and when, the visils are scheduled, an agenda would be released 
so Ihose involved tn the process could schedule i

IPFW promotes faculty exchange program 



By RALPH HAINES 
Staff Writer 

"The exchange was arranged so 
easily. I think anyone concerned that it 
might be a long, difficult process will 
be surprised," stated Roberta A. 
Tierney. associate professor of nursing 
and IPFW's first National Faculty 
Exchange participant. 

The National Facully Exchange is 
headquartered at IPFW and is the 
brainchild of Betie Worley, assistant lo 
the Vice Chancellor. Worley, who is 
executive direclor of the NFE, ex- 
plains that, in her visits to campuses 
across the counlry as director of the 
National Student Exchange, many of 
the faculty members, while praising 
the Student Exchange Program, would 
ask why something of the sort was not 
being done for faculty and staff. A 
task force was put together as a result 
of this concern and the National 
Faculty Exchange was formed three 
years ago. 

The National Faculty Exchange is a 
campus-based membership program. 
Membership, which is open Lo 
regionally accredited two-and four- 
year colleges and universities in the 
U.S. (and in Canada starting this 
summer), now includes 131 colleges 
and universities. Two federal agencies 
and four Washington-based 
educational associations are also in- 
cluded in the consortium. 

The NFE is national in scope and, 
unlike clearinghouses, centrally 
brokers the exchange of faculty and 
staff. While a one-to-one exchange 
would be the ideal situation, according 



to IPFW campus coordinator O. 
Franklin Kenworthy, dean of 
academic services, the pool concept 
used by the NFE accommodates multi- 
lateral placements, eliminating the 
need for direct campus-to-campus 
exchange. An incoming replacement is 
likely lo come from a campus other 
than the one receiving the exchangee. 

According to Kenworthy, the two 
greatest problems wilh the NFE at 
IPFW are : 1 1 the natural reluctance of 
ihe department to release a professor 
without a replacement; and 21 the 
Midwest (this applies lo all colleges 
and universities in the Midwestl has 
less to offer geographically and 
educalionally than the easl or west 
coasts, the mountain states, or certain 
cities — such as Washington, D C. 

Bette Worley points out the NFE is 
starting to look at a possibility of co- 
writing grants with local instilutions to 
obtain funds for temporary 
replacement where an incoming ex- 
changee is not available. While the 
exchanges are primarily for 
educational reasons, the faculty 
members understandably often wish to 
see a totally different environment — 
and many wish to involve their entire 
family in the experience. 

Worley stresses that the exchanges 
are different than sabbaticals. "Many 
sabbaticals are research -oriented or 
for the purpose of producing a book," 
she explains, "whereas with the 
faculty and staff exchange the op- 
portunity is, to some extent, lo do the 
things similar to what you are doing on 
your home campus, bul a chance to do 
them in a very different teaching 



environment with different colleagues 
and different student population, and a 
chance to experiment or to learn 
things that you might not learn in the 
raiher stable environment al your 
homecampus." 

In Ihe first year of the exchange, 
Worley notes, every one of the 27 ex- 
changees reported a significant 
change in their approach to leaching 
as a result of their experience. 

Roberta Tierney, associate 
professor of nursing, views her 
semester at the University of North 
Carolina al Charlotte as a positive 
experience. "It gives you an op- 
portunity lo go somewhere else, see 
how olher people do things, compare 
how you do things," she says, "and see 
if there are either some ideas lhat you 
can transplant back lo your depart- 
ment or some things you can share 
with them (the host department)." 
One of Tierney's more unusual 
assignments while al UNC was to 
serve on a search and screen com- 
mittee for a new dean of Ihe depart- 
ment of nursing. 

Kenworthy points out there was a 
great deal of mobility among faculty 
until the mid-seventies, and thai 
mobility stimulated and challenged 
the professional in higher education. 
Today, economic uncertainty has 
reduced lhai mobility with a 
corresponding loss of challenge 
creating a need for special programs. 
He feels Ihe NFE can be one of Ihe 
lools to be used to maintain an ef- 
fective, quality education. 

Worley mentions that many of the 
host coordinators tor department 



chairs) reported thai the interaction of 
Ihe exchangees did something to 
change their departments. The 
department lo which the faculty 
member returned also felt it bad 
gained by the exchange. Elaine 
Cowan, chair of the department of 
nursing at IPFW said of Tierney, 
"When Roberta came back, she 
brought a wealth of knowledge about 
another school of nursing, one similar 
lo ours in that they did have an R.N. 
completion program. She brought 
back suggestions about things they 
were doing there that we might in- 
corporate here. She also wrote me 
. several times with information. " 

Kenworthy and Worley both em- 
phasize the NFE program is new and 
growing, and in something of an ex- 
perimental stage, with changes yel to 
be made. At present, it appears the 
principle benefactors of the program 
may be faculty and staff in mid-forties 
to mid-fifties, because they arc freer lo 
pursue such a course; their families 
are raised and the economic pressures 
are lessened. However, there has been 
considerable interest among the 
younger faculty. 

One of Ihe timetables the NFE is in 
at this moment is the solicitation of 
interest in the program — not in the 
form of applications, but simply by an 
indication of interest in a possible 
exchange in Ihe future. Preliminary 
applicalion forms are available for 
that purpose. Anyone wanting more 
information concerning the National 
Faculty Exchange program is en- 
couraged to contact Worley in Ihe 
office of the vice chancellor 



Campus launches Young Child celebration 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

No rain, nor sleet , nor snow can slop 
IPFW families from gathering for an 
afternoon of fun and games Sunday 
afternoon, north of the Multipurpose 
building. 

The occasion is the second annual 
Family Day sponsored by the fPFW 
division of education. 

"This is really a fun festival type of 
thing," said Gregory Bell, assistant 
professor in the division of education. 

Family Day is the first day of a week 
of events lo celebrate the national 
Week of the Young Child, April 20-26. 
Winiield Moses, mayor of Fort Wayne, 
will be al IPFW Sunday al noon to 
launch family day and lo present a 



formal proclamation of the Week of the 
Voung Child In Fort Wayne. 

On Family Day, all the events are 
free and open to the public, according 
to Bell. However, the event is coor- 
dinated for IPFW families. 
"Specifically, we try to focus in on the 
faculty, students and staff of IPFW," 
continued Bell. 

Some of Ihe activities lhat will be 
sponsored are a puppet show, a moon 
walk, and a balloon launch. The Fori 
Wayne Police Department will also 
have a fingerprinting booth, and will 
bring Robby the Robot to talk lo the 
children about safety rules and traffic 
signs. 

In the event of rain, the events will 
move inside the Multipurpose 
Building, according to Bell 



The week of celebrations in honor of 
young children will continue on 
Monday wilh a seminar lo discuss the 
national accreditation syslem for 
early childhood programs. That evenl 
will take place al 7 p.m. at the Fort 
Wayne Public Library. 

On Tuesday at 7 p.m., Ihe 
Association of preschool leachers will 
have a meeting at the New Haven 
United Methodist Nursery. After- 
wards, Lowell Madden, assistant 
professor of education at IPFW, will 
talk about "Self-esteem in Children." 

Wednesday night, there will be a 
teacher appreciation dinner at 6:30 
p.m. in the IPFW Walb Memorial 
Ballroom. The North Side High School 
Jazz Choir will enlertain. and Carol 



Carley, president of the Indiana 

License Child Care Association, will be 
theguest speaker. 

The week will conclude Saturday al 
IPFW with a Northeast Indiana 
Association for the Education of Young 
Children Regional Conference. The 
conference will last from8:30a.m.to4 
p.m. 

Beli felt it important lo nole that the 
studenls in his classroom development 
course have contributed greatly to 
organizing the events for Family Day. 
Bell said his students gave him an 
ultimatum - lo either let them help with 
this year's Family Day, or not have the 
events al IPFW. Bell complied with 
their wishes. 

"I facilitate, not profess," said Bell. 
" ..Students should be involved."

Advice on improving 
IPFW student elections 



vip Ipu Vote jzr in tub stvdmnt 

G(NMNflEMT ELECTION T 



Last week's Students Government and 
SUBOG elections came and went, with 
only 2.5 percent of the IPFW student 
body casting votes for their peers. That 
means 97.5 percent of the students didn't 
vote for one reason or another. Many 
students said that they didn't even know 
about the election and never saw any 
place to vote, let atone who the 
candidates in question were. 

However, of the students who did 
make an effort to vote ( this took place in 
the basement of Kettler Hall, in case you 
weren't one of them) , east theirs 
overwhelmingly for the Mothenvell- 
Kostoff-SehJueter team. 

In an informal poll of students taken in 
the library, the Classroom-Medical 
Building, Walb Memorial Union and 
Neff Hall, only one out of four students 
were aware of the event at all. 

Many of these students had advice for 
running future elections. One of the most 
frequently offered was creating a 
greater visibility of the candidates — 
they'd like to at least know who they're 
voting for. 

Another suggestion was for the 



distribution of voting "districts" in 
various buildings around the campus. 
Many students, believe it or not, do not 
frequent the basement of Kettler Hall. 
The possibility of the candidates 
holding forums in the often empty 
Classroom-Medical Building auditorium 
was also raised. If the candidates heed 
this advice, the voters would benefit in 
several ways: 

1. Voters could attach a face and voice 
to the names and stances of the 
candidates. 

2. Voters would be given more of an 
opportunity to cast their votes if more 
than one site were provided. 

3. Voters would have the chance to ask 
questions of the candidates, about their 
past performance, policies and future 
activities. 

Taking these suggestions into 
consideration, we are given the 
impression that a higher voter turnout is 
potentially out there. Many voters chose 
toabstain not because they didn't bother 
to vote, but because they don't want to 
make an uninformed choice. 



On choosing professors 



Having trouble deciding which classes 
you should sign up to take this fall? And 
which professors to take those classes 
with? You're not alone. 

Last week, an IPFW student, Ray 
Raynor, wrote a Letter to the Editor 
suggesting a solution to this problem: a 
class -profess or directory. 

We suggest this directory be a 
compilation of the biographies of 
professors, listing their educational 
background, their teaching experience, 
the number of semesters they have 
taught certain classes, and classes they 
taught in the past. 

Students could then check under a 
professor's name and discover that 
Professor X graduated in 1975 from the 
state university with a Master's Degree 
in a certain subject. He has since taught 
classes A, B, and C in that subject at 
IPFW. 

However, Raynor's idea of including 
students evaluations creates a problem. 
If the professor himself, or his 
department, chooses the evaluations to 
print in the directory, then there is a 
high risk of bias Not all evaluations 
could feasibly be included, either. 

If an unbiased third parly were to 
choose the evaluations, this would solve 
the dilemma. But face it, each 
evaluation is different because each 
student is influenced by different things. 
No student fills out a completely 



objective evaluation of a class. 

In addition to consulting the professor 
list, students could consult another 
section of the directory, a 
comprehensive listing of course 
descriptions similar to that in the 
Bulletin. However, this listing would 
also include a general synopsis of the 
course assignments, exams, and 
expectations written by each of the 
professors instructing a section of that 
course. 

This listing would read something like 
"Course A, basics of some subject..." 
followed by a brief paragraph, similar to 
that in the bulletin, describing the course 
in general. 

Then after that, "Professor X requires 
three exams, five quizzes, and a written 
essay. He also grades down for repeated 
absences." Professor Y requires four 
exams and five quizzes, and while he 
does not require attendance, N percent 
of his exams are based on class 
"lecture." t ! 1 "" ■' ..' -' ! • • 

This directory would then be placed in 
the library for student use, solving the 
dilemma of choosing courses and 
professors. This is a viable solution, and 
it compromises with both the students 
and the faculty. 

Perhaps the new Students 
Government officers should look into 
this as a project for next Spring or Fall 
'87. 




Unlike Ronny, Billy 'kept his pants on' 



By MARK RUSSELL 

The Reagans are reported 
to be privately embarrassed 
over their son Ron dancing 

"Saturday Night Live." 
Neither party has a corner 
on good taste, but at least 
Billy Carter kept his pants 
on. 

Billy drank a few beers 
and the public went crazy. 
Young Ron prances around 
in his skivvies and the public 
figures he must be doing an 
artistic interpretation of 
"Swan Lake'' and a Fruit of 
the Loom commercial. 

Oh, I know — what family 
hasn't been embarrassed at 
one time or another by their 
kid standing in front of the 
presidential seal half-naked 



on network television? 
happens all the time. 
At any rate, the I 
need not be embarrassed 
There will be plenty of time 
for that when NBC reruns 
the show during every big 
rating period for the next 
three years. 

Banana glamourama 

Does your town have a 
Banana Republic? It's a new 
chain of clothing stores 
featuring trendy safari 
outfits — worn mostly by 
people stalking the deli 
counter on Saturday mor- 
nings pretending lo be 
Robert Redford and Meryl 
Streep. 

Banana Republic outlets 



were right there in responses 
to the "Out of Africa" look 
among Americans whose 
beast of burden is a Volvo. 

It's a jungle in there — 
with the leather, the zebra 
skins, the dusty suede, and 
day-old leopard hides. And 
that's just the underwear. 

Talk about authentic. I 
was in one of the stores last 
week and all the clerks were 
busy — boiling a missionary. 

Banana Republics look 
like, well, banana republics. 
Ronald Reagan saw one and 
wanted to give il Sioo 
million. 

About my wealth 



about success. 

Stuck in a job with no 
future? I started with $5,000 
a year and wound up owning 
real estate on Park Avenue 
and sacks of money hidden 
from Bangkok to Barcelona, 
How? Selling soap door to 
door. 

I, too, was skeptical at 
first. An annual income of 
only five grand can become 
a piece of Manhatlen's 
Trump Tower and clothes 
closets the size of Macy's for 
your wife., -But^you gotta 



believe in miracles! 

I try not lo listen to the 
grouches who refuse to 
believe 1 made my fortune 
honestly. They never had the 
perseverance it lakes to talk 
lo a housewife inlo signing 
an order for S3 million worth 
of bleach. 

Let them scoff. Let them 
probe. In my heart I know 
I'm honest All it takes is a 
level playing field and a flat 
lax.

Fast paced action at PIT greets spring 




By M.KATHLEEN 

GREVEN 

Features Editor 

Before you settle in lo 

watch PIT'S production of 

Neil Simon's 'Barefoot in the 

Park,' directed by Joel K. 

Murray, practice listening 

carefully — you'll want to 

catch every one-liner and 

wiltyquipin the play. 

Donette Blanks is at her 
perkiest as Corrie Bratter, a 
newlywed delighted with the 
possibilities of the couple's 
new apartment. 

Not everyone in her life 
shares her enthusiasm, 
though. As her husband, 
Paul, enters the threshold of 
the apartment gasping for 
the faintest of breath, Corrie 
can't fathom why he's so 
winded from "just five 
flights, if you don't count the 
front stoop!" He finally 
musters up the strength for 
his reply. "I counted the 
front stoop!" He gasps. 



Played by PIT 
Fredrich Basnight, he is the 
perfect foil for Corrie's 
unbridled enthusiasm. They 
play off each other with split- 
second precision throughout 
the show, 

Corrie's mother, the 
equally enthusiastic Natalie 



Edmond English, is also 
appalled by Corrie's choice 
of living quarters. "When 
you were litUe, you always 
wanted to live on the moon," 
she said sweetly, "but I 
thought you were kidding ! " 

As we are introduced to 
the gasping delivery man, 
Charles Aston Humphrey, 
and the phone man, Stuart 
Washington, only one visitor 
seems oblivious to the six 
flight climb and doesn't 
enter the apartment righting 
to breathe He's Has Busta 
Manley, the neighbor who 
lives in a tiny apartment on 
the roof. He reaches his 
home by cheerfully climbing 
through the Bratter's 
bedroom window. 

The plot thickens as 
Corrie's mother and ec- 
centric neighbor get to know 
each other as Paul and 
Carrie gel acquainted 

The theme song for this 
play should be Jimminy 
Cricket's rendition of "If 
you're young at heart," 
because that seems to be 
what it takes to survive. Ask 
Corrie's mother and Bas 
Busta! 

The play continues this 
weekend and next at 8 p.m. 
Tickets are available at the 
PITboxoffice

Van Halen shows off new lead at concert May 2 



By GARY LACY 

Staff Writer 

When David Lee Roth left 

Van Halen last year, the 

future of the band was 
questionable. Would the 
band continue — if so, who 
would be lead singer? Those 
questions were quickly 
answered just a few months 
ago. 

Shortly after Roth left the 
band, it was announced at a 
music awards ceremony 
that solo rock artist Sammy 
Hagar would take the lead 



singing post for Van Halen. 
This announcement led to 
Van Halen's first album with 
Hagar, "5150." 

The title of the album is 
the California police code for 
the criminally insane 

The album contains nine 
new songs that provide a 
new direction for the band. 
From the fast-moving, hard- 
driving "Get Up" to the 
slower feel of "Dreams," 
each song shows a new 



The last song on side two of 
the album, entitled "Inside," 
displays Hagar's en- 
thusiasm for being a part of 
Van Halen. He states in the 
lead vocal that "It's not what 
you are, it's how you dress. 
That's one thing I've learned 
from these guys." 

Although Hagar does not 
play guitar on the new 
album, Van Halen's concert 
appearances promoting the 
album will give him plenty of 



energy for the veteran opportunity to use the guitar 
rockers. Edward Van Halen steps 



back to the synthesizers that 
appeared on the band's last 
album, "1984." The syn- 
thesizer makes some ap- 
pearances on "5150," mainly 
on the tracks "Love Walks 
In" and "Dreams." 

Another change in Van 
Halen with the release of the 
new album is that every 
current member is married. 
They all claim wives, 
eliminating the bachelor 
image that the single David 
Lee Roth look with him when 
he left.

"5150" definitely has great 
potential, mainly because of 
the new direction each track 
on the album takes. The new 
Van Halen is a polished, 
revamped band with fresh 
material for their many 
dedicated fans.

Cass D'Angelo Coldwater Road 

10 minutes by car IS minutes to gel order 

I The next time you're hungry for Italian food, skip 
out to Casa D'Angelo, where the waitress will describe 
(he two daily lunch specials for a mereS2.50. 

For this one low price, you get the dark, quiet in- 
timacy that Casa has long been known for, impeccable 
service and a choice of the two rotating entrees, their 
signature salad and warm loaves of bread. 

One recent special was the spaghetti and meatball 
lunch — firm pasta in a thick red sauce, dotted with 
herbs, spices and diced vegetables. 

The house salad that is included with the lunch 
special is one of this cities favorites. It consists of 
fresh lettuce torn into bite-sized pieces, crumbled 
chunks of cheese, pimento strips and, rumor has it, 
certain addictive substances. This assertion is based 
upon an informal survey of faithful customers. Their 
mouths were stuffed with the salad at the time the 
question was posed, but a vigorous nod is scientific 
enough for me. 

An added attraction at lunch time are the warm 
little loaves of bread. The thick, crusty slices are great 
slathered with the butter provided and are also very 
useful for cornering every last drop of the spaghetti 
sauce. 

The service at Casa is so efficient and the at- 
mosphere so unhurried that it's actually _ 
eat a leisurely lunch and still have time left over to 
visit with your companion(s). 

However, you must be warned that this restaurant 
can be habit forming. You'll start daydreaming about 
the salad or little warm loaves of bread during a 
lecture then find yourself mysteriously in front of the 
place instead of at your next class. If this does occur, 
take comfort in the fact that if your instructor shows 
up during the course of your lunch, by the time his or 
her eyes adjust to the lighting, you can be out of there!

double and Paul Fower- 
baugh followed with a walk. 
Both batters advanced a 
base on a wild pilch. Matt 
Norlh layed down a sacrifice 
bunt to score Dickerson and 
Troy Hershberger then 
singled in Fowerbaugh. 



Both Dickerson and Glen 
Berggoelaz had two hits and 
Hershberger picked up the 
win. North was credited with

IPFW eight innings, but the 
'Dons finally got the job 
done. North pitched IPFW to

against seven St. Joe pit- 
chers, but it took a three-run 
eighth inning to secure the

has signed a letter of intent to attend IPFW. Williams 
averuged 13.8 points and 9.2 rebounds per game last season 
for Malcom X Junior College in Chicago. He is the first

Kast to coach runners 



By BART AKEV 
Sports Editor 

Michael H, Kast is the new 
coach of the men's and 
women's cross country 
teams of IPFW, announced 
Dave Skelton, director of 
athletics. 

For Kast, the appointment 
is a homecoming of sorts. He 
was interim coach for the 



Mastodons in 1983-84. An 
experienced runner himself, 
Kast finished third in the 
National Senior Master's 
Track and Field 10,000 meter 
run in Indianapolis last year. 

He has tutored several 
area runners in the finer 
skills of long-distance 
running for four years and 



has taught the YMCA's 
marathon classes for two 
years. 

The Mastodon's new coach 
will conduct 

organizational meeting e 
p.m.. April 30, in the Multi- 
purpose Building. 
runners interested in joining 
ihe I9B6-87 team should 
attend. 



Soccer coach named 



By BART AKEY 
Sports Editor 

Jim Sharpe has been 
named the new soccer coach 
at IPFW, announced Dave 
Skelton, Director of 
Athletics. 

Sharpe, who played for the 
Mastodons from 1979 to 1983, 
admits it will be a change 
HuiriK from player to coach, 
but he believes the fact that 



he has played at IPFW will 
help him in recruiting and 
relating to the players. 

"I will concentrate on the 
same areas or recruiting 
that IPFW has in the past, 
because that is where I also 
have mv contacts," Sharpe 
said. 

His main recruiting thrust 
will be locally, where he 
hopes to sign some of the top 



area talent. Another soccer 
stronghold is the East 
Chicago-Munsler area and 
Sharpe will be recruiting 
there as well as all over ' 
state. 

A forward for the 'Dons. 
during his playing days, 
Sharpe netted 16 goals and 
was a four-year starter. He 
helped lead the team lo a 36 
20-6 record during that span.
