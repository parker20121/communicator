Campus police crack down on speeding 



by Mishanna Wood. 
Managing Editor 

Speeding has always been a 
problem on campu.^, according to 
Lauren Denhanog. chief ol PoUec 
and Saltiy; howci'en Ihe nddlUun of 
an esira squad car wiUi ladar has 
helped ioaic more dnvers widi lead 
(cvl. In die pasL Police and Salcly 
only had a single vehicle equipped 
widi radar. It was frequendy used 
for avariciy of services, making the 
enfoncmEnt of speeding laws raUler 
diriiculi. 

"Students have a lut on dieir 
minds. Many speed becau^ ihcy 
gol up laic and they are running laic 
for class." said Siephan Dunon, a 
Police and Safety oHicer. People arc 
used to going a cenain speed, said 
Burton. 

There arc about five to sii con- 
lacls (being pulled over by police 
and safety) for speeding a day. The 
speed limit on campus toads is 20 
miles per hour and 15 miles per hour 
in parking lots. Dunon said he has 
clocked people as bigh as 45 miles 
per hour. 

This speed may seem slow lo 
die driver, bul imagine bow fasi ii 
seems to a pedestrian, said 
Denhanog, Bunon and Denhanog 
feel diat 20 miles per hour is an 
approprble speed for a campus sel- 



ling. I'specially during diis lime of 

The roundabout is an area of 
panicular concern to die ofTiccR 
and members of the campus com- 
munity. Heavy pedestrian [raffle is 
present neartbc baseball and soccer 
fields and tennis eoutts, which are in 
the vicinity oflhc roundabout. ?as\- 
moving vehicles arc a hazard lo any- 
one near them, according to 
Denhanog and Bunon 

"When people speed on die 
roundabout, dicy think diey're on a 
racetrack," said Denhanog. When 
people drive, dicy have lo pay atten- 
tion to diemselves and everything 
going an around them, said 
Denhanog. 

An accident widi a pedcsuian 
bas not occurred on campus, accord- 
ing to Denhanog and Burton, 
although there have been some 
fender benders. In order to bclp pre- 
vent any wrecks between people 
and auios, mcmbcn of Police and 
Safely confront iratTic violators widi 
a verbal or written warning, a cam- 
pus ticket or a traffic violauon, 
Bunon said he has never adminis- 
icnaj a tegular uidTic viobtion and 
few campus tickets. When a person 
docs receive a campus ticket, said 
Bunon. dial person is getting a 

Police and Safety have die 
same audioiity as city officers, 
therefore they could pcnidizc 



one widi a tratTie violation thjt 
would cost S130 to S200 and add 
points to dieit driving rceoid. A 
campus ticket only costs S40 and no 
points arc added to a dnving record. 
A person has 1 5 days to pay a cam- 
pus lickcl or appeal iL II Uie dead- 
line Is not met and no appeal has 
been made, SIO is added for each 
week die payment is laic and stu- 
dents cannot view grades or register 
for classes. Bunon said he only 

frequent violators 

"Students are poll u; and Uiey 
understand. They are glad it is a 
campus ticket. Iliere usually isn't 
anyone who doesn't know dK rea- 
son why diey are being stopped," 
said Burton. 

Bunon and Dcnhartog agree 
Ihal everyone at IPPW has a stake in 
its safety. The actions of one indi- 
vidual do have an effect on odier 
individuals Bunon said dial every- 
one is in a hurry and speeding is n« 
the only problem. Disregarding uaf- 
Oc signs and parking designation.s 
arc other ongoing problems. 

Fur the most part, die campos 
community obeys \bac laivs, said 
Bunon and Deiihanog, Police and 
Safety penaliies Uiosc who disobey 
Ihe laws as a reminder, said 
Denhanog, Tralfic signs an: posted

can also be found in die student

TiiJte for example ihe situation we saw 
here on campus about two weeks :igo. A car 
ibai had been dhving aiound caoipus puUed 
into one of Ihc disabled paiifing spots in front 
of NelT Hall. On the ccview miiTDC bung a 
handicapped paiking lag. Wc really did not 
think much about ttii.'; until bodi car doors 
openeil and out stepped the car's occupants. 
Both the male and (cmalc sludenu strutted up

even paying attention (o tlie fai:t dial diey 



I u miklii nLi hji. thought 

znt driving around trying to find a

she did nol look [ike Ihe happiest of people as 
she made her way up to campu'^. Who con 
blame her though 1 

This is nol ihe only dmc wc have seen 
ihis occur on campus. This incideni seems to 
happen on a more regular basis. It is sad lo 
see some of our own fellow siudcnts taking 
advantage of ifae handicapped parking spots. 
[I is hard lo ci3ck down on such incidents 
happening here on campus when Ibe car is 
ab-cady parked and one would have no reason 
to doubt Ihat the person legitimately was dLi- 
ablcd, Yel it does happen. Realistically, the 
campus police cannot monitor djc handi- 
capped parking spols designated in each paik- 



Pi;ople just need lo show respect to odi 
CIS who are disabled and not lake aw-ay ibei 
parking spou just toamd parking m a distant 
parking lot and walk across campus If Ihc 
rest of us can make il up lo campus, si 
those parking in handicapped paiking spou 
who should not be. What gives people Ihe 
right 10 diink Ihal Ihey can gel away w' * 
parking in the handicapped paiking spoisl 
it because diey have nol been caught yet? 
Eventually, it will caich up with Uiem. In " 
way. il seems thai wc are taking somelhir 
lhal does not belong to us. Some people might 
call it stealing, some might consider il against 
dicir bcilei moral judgment nol to do such a 
thing, [n Ibe end. it is uncalled for and very 



ftji yourself in the posiljon of those who 
are disabled and ask yourself bow you would 
feel. We hope lhal people will think twice 
again before pulling into handicapped park- 
ing spots when they are not disabled and 
decide not to lake advantage of dial handl 
capped parking tag on dicir rearview mirror.

The parable of the 
curt coffee sippers 

by Nalhan Ericson. Staff Wriler 

ll's a beautiful spring evening downtown It's 
Saturday eight and the moon is out. The temperature 
reached a nice 60 degrees ard there was a gende breeze 
ii dw fweaifli ytacQewiMdoyp-p at HcadiMlMi 
Park. 1 was nt ihc Pfeilfcr House wj^ my girlfriend for 
some coHee. it you have never hcud of the Pfeiffcr 
House, il Is a historic house downtown thai has been 
trmsformed into a cnffee/dessen shop 

Tbe PfeifTer House is a very intriguing place to sit 
and relax and ibis evening it was particularly inicreit- 
ing. I knew who the woiier was. He's a nice guy and he 
was running around like a chicken with his head cut 0^. 
The PTeifler House was bu.^icr Ihu Saluiday evening 
than 1 have ever seen iL Our waiter was trying hard, bui 
al one poini he got confused ot something and he start- 
ed U) take an order from a mblc of people wbo had just 
goaen there Dierc was a table of people who had been 
there previously-maybe duee minules-but he missed 
ibcm for one reason or another. In my book, ii would 
have been no big deal. 1 would have simply raised my 
band when he walked by and said, "1 think we are ready 
to order" I would have had a smile on my face and I 
would have been extremely polite tueause bey, we arc 
all human, aren't we? 

Well. 1 gues.s i just handle things a bit diffeiendy 
than some. Before our waiter could finish his. "Hi, I 
will be your wii-" speech, 1 beard, "HEY! What do you 
think j-ou'ic doing.' We were bcre firsi!" 1 pu^iosefully 
capiialiicd die "HEY," because it was very loud. 
Needless to say. our waiter slopped helping the other 
table and went straight to ibe "Cun Coffee Sippers'" 

Tlicy didn't get iheir drinks any faster dian ihe rest 
of us, but Ihey really embarrassed the guy Did 1 forget 
to mention that he was working hard and that it was 
really busy? Well, it was. One question, and it seems as 
though this comes up a great deal in my "How To Treat 
Olhet People" column dial I write most every week. 

Why is the general populauon so rude and selfish? 
I don'i understand why we is humans feel dial we have 
the light [odegiade and basically "poop" upon o diets in 
order to make ourselves feci belter Is this a power 
thing? Do hutnan beings need to put others tJown m 
order lo make diemselves feci special and imponani? I 
don'i diink I have ever done thai purposefully, nor do I 

What about working hard and having a sense of 
pride in what you do? Does that make you feci special? 
It should. Whal about your family and friends? Do [bey 
lost you and make &gt;'ou feel special? Ttcy should. Then 
why ija we focus on die quirks ofodiers or small occur- 
reoces in our days lo nit-pick and slander someone? 1 
hale to say it, bul "Can't we all jusl get alongT' 

I think I know why diis couple at Ihe colfee shop 
was so distraught about not ordering right away. They 
muii not have had Uieir daily dose of one pot of coffee 
and Ihey were going through wldidrawal Yes. that's it. 
and ibcy NEEDED dieir coffee RIGHT AWAY in order 
to gel the caffeine into dieir bloodstream. I guess 1 
understand??? 



'Working' your retirement: Wrestling's most popular con game 



by Ben Freese, Staff Wriler 
In the world of profession' 
al wresihng, leliremenu come 
quickly and often. Whedier it's 
due 10 injuries, personal deci- 
sion or a little of bodi, rcurmg 
ha.s always been a respectable 
tianiiii fm to fcal. lititJM,.Bj(i, 
wTcsllcrs. Leaving die job, never 
10 iclum lo Un: "squared circle,", 
was indeed a goal most 
wresUeis wated and longed for 
and, when il came, the time was 
right 10 finally settle down. Any 
wrestler reading diis right now 
IS laughing his butt off or realiz- 
ing die sad irony of his life. 
WrestleRne«r retire. 

They pretend lo, Ihey actu- 
ally try 10 and they're told lo. 
but Ihc only way any pro 
wrestler is ever going to suiy 
iciirad is by dying. 

The an of "working" is a 
popular one in pro wrestling. 
Basicilly, what "working" 
means is tliat the person is con- 
ning you. "Woiking the boys" is ' 
a popular expression dial pro- 
molers use in reference lo how 
they are able to trick dieu own 



employees. 

It's also used to describe 
when a wrestler is having a 
match (no wrestler back in die 
locket room says, "Hey, I'm 
workmg with Hulk Hogan 
.lOdfghLc'.') Comc.loUiink of ii, 
that means essc^ally die same 
thing, because- a' wrestling 
match is merely an illusion or a 
lie to Ihe audience. 

The problem with "work- 
mg" isn't wiih ihe piomoieis or 
the wrestlers [hcmsclves (pro- 
moters have to trick Uieii own 
employees lo remain the evil 
carnivores that ihcy arc and 
wresdcrs bav-c to trick the crowd 
if the sbow's supposed to be 
entertain log); ihe problem is 
widi wrestlers "woiking" their 
relircmenis. It's guaranteed dial 
if &gt;'ou watch a wrestling pro- 
giam, whedici &gt;'ou'ie a fan or 

wiesdci is just "working" you. 

It used to be less obvious. 
3i die '80s and Wi wcie perfect 
e^tamplcs of the long "working" 
process. A wicstler would rclire. 



go make some movies, go home, 
etc. and evcniually find his/her 
way back lo dK big game. 

Thai usually lasled any- 
where from six monlhs lo six 
years, bul the wresOeis always 
came back. Even if dicir inten- 
lions were good at first, by com- 
ing back Oicy revealed they 
were e&amp;scntially "working" die 
wrcsding audience. For the last 
two ycai^i it's become a differ- 
ent silualion entirely 

[n Ibis day and age. where 
lucking or "woiking" Ihe audi- 
ence is so important and inlegial 
to TV ratings {keeping die audi- 
ence guessing, basically, lo 
ensure they'll come back for 
more), retirements happen pmc- 
ticaUy cvay week. Seriously. 
It's gelling ridiculous and it's 
dcsuoying die credibility of alt 
diose wrestlers who parocipalc 
In these little games played by 
promoters lo fallen their pocket- 
To all those fools out d)ere 
who are non-wresding fans wbo 
are saying, "Cridibiliiy? A pro 



daily jusl to please a television 
audience or some screaming, 
bloodthirsty tans. 

Shame on you for even 
considering your shallovf life 
more imponani Uian iSi lives of 
these people. These people give 
up dicit families, their jobs, their 
healdi. welfare and bodies, some 
jusl lo get ahead or to earn a 
ridiculously low pay-off Don't 
bebeve me? Go rem die real-life 
documentary "Wrestling with 
Shadows" or see "Beyond die 
Mat" at the Ihcalcr (well, not in 
Fort Wayne where it isn't show- 
ing, but somewhere) and you'll 
undentand die pain and 
heariacbc iliese people go 
through on a dady basis 

Despite die pain and agony 
Uicsc wresUers experience, die 
profession itself is like a drug 
that keeps summoning them 
back for more. Hence, dte retire- 
ment to spend lime with family 
is really just like a vaeauon to 



Maine where you can'i wall to 
gel back to sunny California, 

That is bow wrestlers Itiink 
and they're destroying them- 
selves widioul even realising it. 
Now they can 'I even come back 
wil^ta,iiHl|e digniti; or self- 
re ^e^^Krausc die^''ic retiring 
every week. 

My plea lo professional 
wrestling has to start witli pco- 
motcis. Give up thb rememeni 
game and allow dicse baiiered 
human beings to leave graceful- 
ly. Sure, diey're your puppets, 
but dierc wUl always be more 
pro wrcstlen lo take their place. 
To the wrestlers, I say tliis; 
When you're ready, give it up. 
Don't Slay past your welcome 
and don't bold on until you keel 
over. When you retire, don't 
"work" the boys, audience, ihc 
promoters or yourself. Just let 
go and begin to work on patch- 
ing your rugged life into a nice 
new fresh slarL Remember, pro 
wrestling will always be around. 
You won't.

Procrastination is a regular in my life 



by Malissa Fritz, Features Editor 

Well, ii ii coming closer lo \b&lt; 
end ol yel anoiber taneua bac al 
IPFW. Thai means finiiUng last 
minule projccu. japcn and studying 
fur final exanu. Oil yeab. wtul joy 
that will bcl Eadi sonutcr at this 
(imc, I sian to get ntirmcly lUesscd 
out like 3 lot ormy olbcr (eUow xni- 
denU. I'm sure. It would be la easy 
for mc 10 blame my profKMij tor 
iJl llie ilrcu dial I'm feeling right 
now. but in reality it is myKll that [ 
need 10 blaroc. For me, ii LI this con- 
cept dT pntcrastinalion that I take 
full adinniage of. The qucsiion thai 
pops into my mind, though. Is 
wtuiher procra.Mination really a all 
that bad? 

A/ier four years here ai IPFW. 
one would think ihai I would Isam 
noi to procrastinati; so mucli 
Choosing ID proos^slinale all the 
time has not been one of the 
anarlcsi decisions that I have ever 
made. Each semesier I tell myself 
that (his lime around will be difTer- 
cnl, I'm going lo slay on top of 
things and gel assigntnenls done 
ahead of time, yet 1 never fallow 
through with this wonderful idea, li 
was delinitcly a nice ihougbl. 



though only for ihe momenL Once 
again, 1 end up in &amp;ont of my com- 
puter. Ma:i, very late ai nigfii wiib 
my cans of Mounlain Dew sitting 
nm to me ready forme to drink and 
some chocolaie to eat. wondering if 
tonight 1 would be so lucky as lo get 
some sleep. unUke the night before. 
If only I would have started diat 
paper a few days earlier like I told 
myieU I would instead of gomg out 
wiih my friends. This would be the 
bad side lo procia^tuution. 

1 must say, though, some of my 
best work bas been done while 
under last minute deadlines. Not all 
ol my work, but some. Maybe ii is 
the aillcnaline rush that I gcl once 
that 2 a.m. mark hits ajid I realize 
that my paper is due in seven hours 
1 sometimes gcl a sudden inspiraiion 
that keeps me going and makes the 
difference in my paper. That makes 
me think that procrastination is a 
good conccpi Tlic feeling that I was 
able to get the paper done and it 
actually turned out belter Ulan I bad 
eipected makes me think dial pro- 
crastination may not be all that bad. 

Now I know some of you 
would probably disagree wilh me. I 



can see it from both the good side 
and bad side of procrastination. That 
h assuming ihat there are two sides 
ID procrastination To those wbo do 
not procrastinate. 1 greatly envy 
you. 1 can hear my mom yelling at 
me ('Malissa Kayn for waiting 
until the lasi minute That is bow I 
have always done things though, 
just put everything off lo Ihe last 
minute. Idoknowthaiitcannotbea 
healthy aspect dje lo the fact thai 
I'm up late at night and drinking 
Mounlain Dew, but hey, it's pan of 
bemg a college siudenL 

Whether piooTisti nation works 
is up to each individual. For me. I 
have grown so accustomed to hav- 
ing procrastination as a pan of my 
college years that 1 do not know 
what it would be like not to have 
procrastination Hguied into my 
stress load. Actually, I might be lost 
wiibout it in life. Sad. t know. 1 have 
gotten belter over the years by cut- 
ling back on procrastination though. 
if Uwt is at all possible. Hopefully 
one day I will tnovt beyond procras- 
imation and appreciate the free lime 
Ihal will possibly come along with 
nut having ii as part ol my life.

Car accident reveals backwards priorities 

by Jody Reiter, Staff Writer ■'■ 



ClBu had ended and now 1 
only had twenty minutes lo get 
home; ettaoge and make it to work. 
Red light] were aggravating me and 
every driver in front ol me lecmed 
to drive slowly on purptse. It was 
strange because I kriew it was going 
to happen. There u-as a tan car 
pulUng oul of an upcoming intcr- 
seclioa. Suddenly the driver went 
and she hadn't e^m made it half 
way oul before ttie ear in ftoni of 
me rushed rigbl iaui her. Having the 
strange susptdan an accident was 
about to occur, I had my foot ready 

Being in a fair number of acci- 
dents myself. I could tell thai what I 
had seen was nothing substantially 
dangerous The woman who had 
been hit had an cupression of 
embarrassment and the man who hit 
her seemed ilumfounded. Then I did 
sumeihing that later surprised me. I 
swerved to Ihe left and kept 

driving. 

In my mind. I felt a little self' 
ish. Here I found myself rushing to 
makeitoit time to my joti- a job thai 
I didn't even really enjoy- when i 
should have been slopping my ear 
to nuke sure nobody was hurt I 



was rebeved aller I glanced into rny 
rear view mirror and noticed every 
drikei behind me hid (oUowcd my 
example. 

Car accidents are strange phe^ 
nomena. I had once witnessed one 
where an elderly woman had acci- 
dentally run a led light She v,-^ 
then hit by a man in a red pickup 
truck. Upon squeahng id a stop on 
tbe sidewalk, Ihe pickup truck iJriv- 
er stormed out and lushed over to 
this elderly woman. He then verbal- 
ly assaulted her wtiilc using words 
that nc all know, but shouldn't say. 
He was pointing and screaming and 
callingberstupid. All tbe while, she 
held her chest, trying to eaich tier 

■Tliis IS my good truck! You 
wrecked my good tnickV he bel- 
lowed as dried paint chips (lew 
from what appeared lo be his work 

His good midc. 

Here stood a man in bis early 
thirties, very strong and physically 
unharmed, shouting at a woman 
who was twice his age and gasping 
for an- because she had caused him 
to wreck his good iruck. Was his 
truck so good that it was worth 
more than a human life? What it 



that woman had been dying right 
before his angry eyes? Would 
knoaing thai this woman's losi life 
experience might be the paia felt 
from single-handedly causing a 
man to ruin his good b^Kk satisfy 
him? Arc people really thai self- 
absorbed? 

Instead of completely snap- 
ping, why didn't this man icaliic 
that be sail had bis trudt and that be 
shouldn't worry about anything 
right now but the safety of the eld- 
erly woman he just smashed into? 

People make mistakes. 
\Vboever causes an accident feels 
bad enough. You're wasting your 
time and Ijecoming redundant if you 
lell them to feel bad 

As 1 drove past the intersec- 
tion accident, I may not have shout- 
ed "Way to go, ladyl You're going 
to make me tale for work," but I 
might as well tiave. Ilad I stopped 
to make sure both victimi w-crc 
TiiK. 1 would have at least been 
pleased with myself. Instead. I 
thought selfishly and scrambkd ofT 
to my S7.2S-an-hDur job. And. as 
far as I could lell. everyone ■ ■ ■ ■

were all pcrfenncd on Monday 
nighi in the Walb Union Ballroom 
by Mike Raybum. 

A crowd galhcied to hear 
Raybum's pefFormance (ha( ivas 
pan of bis bike tour across the 
United Slates. Raybum's perform- 
ance u-as upbeat, eiciting and full 
of laughlcr (broughoul the majority 
of the hour and a half show. 

Numerous ariisls inspired 
Raybum's presentation. 'My inspi- 
rations come from singos sueb as 
Jobnny Cash, the Beatles, the 
Eagles and Tom Petty,' said 
Raybum. These inspirations were 
obvious throughout ihe evening as 
Raybum sang "Green Acres" 
Beatles-slylc and bis personal imi- 
tation of Johnny Cash, which both 
bii the mark. 

Raybum cnieriained ihe 



crowd with his version of 
"Hawaiiaii Punch", with (be meet- 
ing of a Dole banana and a papaya. 
We heard T&gt;evil Went Down lo 
Georgia' on bis acoustic guitar, 
instead of a fiddle. Instead of 'Hotel 
California." v.« beird "Hotel West 
Virginia." A loi of these songs are 
ones ibai be taken requests for ai his 
shows and has rewritten himself 
and put on his CDs. 

Raybum decided (o do a bike 
tour because he knew Uiai physical- 
ly, be could accomplish it and also 
because ii was something new and 
different ud raise attention lo the 
lour. The lour has already taken him 
over 3.O0O miles and will end May 
12 ia New York. Raybum has had 
w-ealher conditions

and bad days along ihc way. "My 
first day was probably my wor^I 
day.' said Raybum. ' 1 hal two flat

aflcr biking S6 miles, which be said 
was a lo( in the bcgiiming "My 
wife and I camped in the desens of 
Arizona." said Raybum. 'We weie

two dogs." Raybum's wife and bis 



mother have been his biggest ftuiu- 
ly suppoiL Tley hope Um( his tnoUi- 
er will be able to Join ibcm on the 
last pan of his lour. 

TbCTC arc iwo reasons why 
Raybum is doing this bike lour. The 
dm reason is lo help raise money 
forSlJude's Hospital. Raybumhas 
a 7.year-old nephew who is now 
cancer-ftce after being diagnosed 
wiih a brain [umoi. His nephew had 
14 surgeries all before the age of 
one. Sl Jude's specializes in cancer 
research and trcatmenl. The second 
reason for the tour it to show thai, 
even wilhout a big record label, one 
can still be successful. With the 
help of Songs com. Raybum has 
be«n able ui produce bis musk and 
go on this bike tour. They also help
