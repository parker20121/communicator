Rain forest perils discussed at festival 



New« Editor 

As port of P.arlh Day ft divides and 
The Distinguished Lecturer Series, 
Mario A. Bo/.o presented a lecture last 
Sunday on "Biodiversity and 
Conservation In Latin America," spon- 
sored by the Biology Department. 

Bozo is a well-known conservation- 
ist, educator, and political policy 
maker, and served as Vice Minister of 
Natural Resources, Energy und Mines, 
in Coila Rica for many yean. 

In addition, be was one of tbe main 
architects for the Notional Park system 
in Costa Rica, which has been used as a 
model (or Third World 

His lecture described 
efforts in Central America. He has been 
a strong force in the development of a 
corridor plan for all of Central America 
that would link National Porks and pri- 
vate reserves to enable the movement 
of animals across many habitats, and to 
provide a biologicol corridor (or the 
movement ond preservation of species 
throughout Central America. 

This Is his dream, he soys. 

Boza also wants people to be aware 
of what is happening 10 the rain forests 
and the problems that mankind is bring- 
ing to the rain forest. 

Funding is one of his main road- 
blocks. Funding is a permanent prob- 
lem—It is olwuys needed for basic 
research and equipment 

Programs have been initialed to pro- 
tect the rain forest— such as "Rcnt-a- 
Forcsls" people are encouraged to rent 
a block of forests to prevent them from 
being cut further. 



His goal is to expand the rain forest 
in Costa Rica (land acres) by 13%. 

According to Bozo, cutting up the 
forest causes climate change in both 
temperature and rain fall. 

'In some areas the rainfall changes 
rapidly in the rain forest of Costa Rica,"

professor of biology, is an expert in

said Boza. 

In the past 70 years, recorded rain- 
fall has decreased by one-third of the 
total. It is estimated around 700 mil- 
limeters. 

Boza says this is too much — it has a 
strong effect on the species. 

"Some species, such as the red mon- 
grovc will probably be reduced as a 
result of this," said Boza. 

Boza is working on The 
Mcsoamerican Biological Corridor, a 
project approved last Fall One of 
Bozas' goals is to establish contact with 
professors who are conducting research 
projects in this area, 
and to increase education applied

Boza, and added "This is detrimental to 
the species." 

Bo/a stressed these projects do 
work: He says the rent-a-forcsl project 
is working, land swaps are working; 
families arc willing to swap their land 
for a price ond move lo better schools, 

Boza states they arc using different 
techniques to acquire land, littlc-by-lit-

A visitor in the audience voiced his 
concern about the effects of tourism on 
the cco-system 

Boza stated as tourism increases, 
human activities create problems. 

"Parks have been established, but 
tourists do not want to contribute 
money to put back into ihe environ- 
ment, said Boza. 

Tourism is always increasing — 
bringing in new hotels ond other infra- 
structure 

It is the second source of revenue to 
this area. 

Land is becoming exhausted that is 
why buying property is so important for 
the eco-structure. 

Banana farming is the primary 
source of revenue. Banana's ore high in 
soil depletion, but it is the Ml money 
maker. Major companies own these 
plantations 

Boza's solution is the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) project, 
sponsored by the Rain Forest Alliance,

New guidelines are required for 
additiunal certification to grow 
bananas. 

All bananas require a stamp with the 
Banana Amigo. New regulations also 
require recycling or incineration of dis- 
eased fruit; in order to prevent harm to 
other species. 

"We think this is a good solution to 
the environmental problem caused by 
bananas." said Boza. 



Know your rights when 
traveling abroad 



by Jo AnnStclnforlh 
News Editor 

Students traveling abroad this 
summer should be aware that their 
constitutional rights will nol follow 
(hem, particularly if they arc caught 
with drugs or performing "harmless" 
acts of vandalism. 

Michael Fay. 18, of Dayton. Ohio. 
did not know that when be broke tbe 
law in Singapore, 

Gary Shcaffer is tbe spokesman 
for the U.S. State Department Bureau 
of Consular Affairs. According to 
Shcaffer, the Bureau of Consular 
Affairs is responsible for the protec- 
tion ond welfare of U.S. citizens 
abroad. The U.S. consular officers 
can visit an American citizen being 
held in a foreign jail. Shcaffer said, 
but cannot get them released. 

In 1993. over 2.500 American cit- 
izens were arrested abroad. Almost 
1.000 of those arrested were held on 
charges of using or possessing drugs. 

Once you leave U.S. soil, U.S. 
laws and constitutional rights no 
longer apply. 

"Most countries don't have bail 
and habeas corpus," said Shcaffer. 
and added "Many countries have 
judicial systems keeping you in jail 
while you are being charged," It 
could take months to be charged. 

According to Shcaffer. what tbe 
U.S. government tries to do is to sec 
if an American prisoner is treated 
humanely and fairly. 

"But often Ihey can't. You will 
be treated like a citizen of that coun- 



try." said Shcaffer 

This applies to all foreign coun- 
tries. Mexico has frequent problems 
with misdemeanors, like drunk and 
d ^orderliness Drug offenses? 

Presently, there ire 50 Americans 
under arrest in Thailand for drug 
offenses 

Young Americans in their 
think they can visit a foreign cour 
and make quick money. Sbaeffcr 
explained. They will carry a suite; 
and think customs people are paid 
off Not so, said Shcaffer. 

Fay is now serving a four month 
jail sentence in Singapore. He has 
been convicted of spray painting can 
over a 10 day-vjndalum spree His 
punishment will be lo be beaten with 
six strokes of a bamboo cane, which 
is tbe custom of that country. 

"His attorneys appealed, but they 
lost the appeal and now arc pursuing 
clemency from Singapore President 
Ong Tcng Chcong," said Shcaffer. 

Shcaffer also warns to be parties 
lorly wary of persons who ask you to 
cany a package by car across a bor- 
der. Once that package or anything ir 
the car is in your possession, yoi 
become responsible for it. 

"You will be blamed for It, m 
matter who has put it there." hi 
warns "You might unknowingly 
become a. narcotics trafficker. To 
local authorities, ignorance is not on 
excuse — you will have to pay tbe 
Fine and may even spend time in jail 
for a crime that you did not know you 
committed." added Shcaffer.

It means one of two tributes to an 
individual with a long and outstanding 
career with IPFW. 

The miniature waterfall wos created 
in honor of Chancellor Joanne Lantz.

5cbolonbips to regularly admitted full- 
time and part-time students with cumu- 
lative grade-point averages of at least 
25- Age of students can range from 14 
to 79. Her goal has been to enlarge 
scholarship opportunities for all stu- 
dents and to address issues of cultural 
diversity. 

"There aren't enough words to tell 
everyone bow excited I am about the 
scholarships." said Lantz. She added 
that it will go a long way in helping the 
students und that it is important lo bcr. 

After a distinguished 29-year 
on this campus, Lantz will be awarded 
on honorary degree — a doctor of 
humane letters, which will be presented 
at IPFW's 27th Commencement on 
May II at the Memorial Coliseum. 

"1 was both surprised and pleased," 
said Lantz. 

Lantz received a B.S From the 
University of Indianapolis in 1953; her 
M.S. from Indiana University in 1957. 
and her PhD from Michigan State 
University in 1969 

'Her career on this campus began in

Where arc the African -American

When is the university going to stop

No! 

According to the government's

your home seminar to the poor indi-

Snyder hears his calling 



To the editor, 

Nearly all semester (at least since 
Ihe cultural/racial wars began being 
waged on these pages) I have resisted 
the urge to write notwithstanding the 
coll: "When is Snyder going lo 
respond?" I have Died, believe me. but 
each lime 1 begin my pages become 
either stained with tears of sadness or 
crumpled in a fist of anger- 
So many people of my generation — 
black, white, red, brown, yellow — gave 
their lives to preventing and eliminat- 
ing the racial and cultural hatreds that 
separatism formerly created. And while 
we did not succeed, we each were com- 
mitted lo healing Ihe wounds that 
remained open wounds in our society. 

Now, it seems, there is again a 
small bul vocal minority of individuals 
who, in the name of cultural or racial 
purity, wish lo inflame Ihc old hatreds 



and prejudices. Strangely, it is not a 
while, balding, ignorant Southern gov- 
ernor with axe-handle in hand calling 
for separatism as a panacea for preserv- 
ing a particular racial or cultural her- 
itage, but young, educaled people of 
color (or the "wanna-be" disenfran- 
chised) wielding pens (or should I say 
word processors) of vitriol. 

Oh, it is easy for you to sit at your 
desks in air-conditioned rooms and 
pound out your rhetoric on anhedonic 
machines. It js wonderful that you can 
philosophize, theorize, and propagan- 
dize in the abstract regarding victim- 
hood. But that is all it is: an abstrac- 

Wbile I am not suggesting that Ms. 
Mcgown. el al. have never been vic- 
tims of racism or prejudice, there is a 
vast difference between receiving sus- 
picious looks or reading other's 
accounts, and trying to rescue a five- 
year old black girl from being encircled 



and urinated on by a group of white 
males. Or, having your hands run scar- 
let from the blood of friends who were 
attacked for doing nothing more than 
trying to buy an ice cream cone. 

No, the world is still far from per- 
fect or even just. Yes. racial and cultur- 
al prejudices ( or worse, apathy) still 
exisls. The answer, however, is not lo 
inflame them through incendiary 
rhetoric or worsen them through 
assigning guilt. Tbe answer is lo invite 
ail to join bands and sing "We shall 
Overcome": to overcome the preju- 
dices, bias, and hatreds which keep us 
from achieving a true brotherhood/ sis- 
terhood of all peoples. 



If we do not learn from our 
past, we are bound to repeat it 



An Open letler To The People 

Two hundred yean ago, an Irishman 
slopped onto a dock in New York and 
thought he would see streets paved with 

gold. 

Two hundred years ago, a Woman 
who had been brought to this country 
by the Dutch horn Africa and sold into 
indentured servitude, was given her 
papers and set free. 

Two hundred years ago. a tribe 
(officially named Ihe Delaware) of Tbe 
People (direct translation of what they 
called themselves) found themselves 
being pushed out of their ancestral 
lands by migrating tribes from all parts 
of the world. 

Two hundred years ago. my family 
was beginning. ...from the dock in New 
York to the plantation in the South lo 
the woodlands of Indiana... 

The Irishman found he was consid- 
ered to be lower than any other man... 
the Woman ( I give her no country des- 
ignation because she came from no 
country and haled her tribe because 
they sold her into slavery) found she 
was not truly free because of tbe color 
of ber skin.. .and The People had no 
concept of freedom because ihey had 
no concept of captivity. The Irishman 
found kinship with Ihe Woman and 
they married- They settled in ihe ances- 
tral lands of Tbe People and found 



acceptance with them. The People mar- 
ried into the couple's family and the 
family married into Tbe People. 

The Irishman was my Great-Great- 
Great-Great Grandfather and the 
Woman was my Great-Grcat-Greal- 
Great- Grandmother. The People were 
also a part of my family and my Father 
holds a direct line lo one of The 
Peoples Water women (beaten). Tbe 
point of my recording my lineage is to 
show thai I like most Americans come 
from a varied and colorful background. 

"Black" Spirituals, Irish Folk Tales, 
and Tribal legends all played an impor- 
tant role in my upbringing. I was born 
in Fairbanks. Alaska and spent much of 
my time out in tbe Eskimo Villages, 
playing and learning with the other 
cbddren....and being "ligbt"-skinned 
made me a minority where I grew up. 
bul I don'l ever remember having lhal 
pointed out to me (except perhaps Ihe 
time someone called me "Litlle Crab" 
when I was sunburned.) 

We spend a lot of time in our soci- 
ety attempting lo balance history with 
today. Perhaps we could lake a lesson 
from The People in lhal Ihey don'l use 
the past as a lever for Ibe present or 
future, bul rather use history to make 
tomorrow a beOer day. My husband's 
ancestors in this country could easily 



the owners of Woman or the 
f The People or Ihe degradcrs 
of The Irishman to me it does not mat- 
ter, because I love him for who be is 
today, ..not what he might have been 
yesterday.,., not for who he might be 
tomorrow. There are many painful 
facets lo history and every group of 
people on Earth is guilty of atrocities al 
some time or another. We musi learn

One of the primary reasons I

the educational arena Juil because 
you ore not right out of high school, 
what you have done with your life U 
important, after all, you arc here lo 
make a difference. This Is not going 
to be a flag-waving sermon extolling 
the virtue* of the great American 
way; this is going lo be about peo- 
ple, reluming adults, and veterans. 
All too often people walk around 
with blinders on, only seeing what they 
wont lo see. Even in our search for 
higher learning, we create questions to 
gel only Ihc answers we want to bear. 
When someone points out a problem or 
answers the question with an answer 
we don'l wanl to hear they ore labeled 
unforgivably. 

When 1 enlisted in the military in 
1979, people who I thought were my 
friends had changed their opinion of 
me, I was still tbe same person, but to 
Ihem I was a war monger. I am active 
In vcierans' affairs, always slaying 
informed on Ihc issues Ibol effect my

important to other veterans, 1 pass it on.

This appears lo be the term people 
around campus loosely associate with 
Tbe Communicator Could i( he that our 
fellow students, frankly, can not handle 
bearing the truth about thai which chal- 
lenges their ideals and beliefs? For 
example, recently a student editor stated 
thai the country was founded by "poor 
white crash." 

A significant number of persons 
who came over to "America" were 
prostitutes, prisoners, and cx-convicls. 
They were outcasts from their country. 
What would you call them? 

These same students were also upset 
that this editor said that the two main 
privileges in this country today are 
being white and male. This is not to 
excite persons, but to tell the truth.

If ibis country is basically run b&gt; 
white males, bow could this statement 
be seen as propaganda ^ Over 70 percent 
of those in Congress and the Senate arc 
while males. There has never been a 
president of color I do not believe thai 
anyone would argue that these persons 
are in control of tbe government, ergo. 
in charge of this country 

Last week, one student publicly 
posted his opinions in the buildings on 
campus. He discussed the open Black 
Collegian Caucus forum that took place 
last Monday Tbe author of Ibis publi- 
cation forgot to add that after be and 
some of his friends kit the room, one of 
the gentlemen in his group decided lo 
share some information with those who 
remained. 

This student staled that he wanted lo 
apologize for the behavior of bis 
friends, and said they were from 
Huntington. He also staled that he hon- 
estly did not know how to talk to other 
African -Americans because of the envi- 
ronment in which he was raised. 



After in exhausting femm m which 
both Douse and 1 were being imdBKt, 
it was very comforting to have a student 
admit his fears and canJiJIt state »h&gt; 
bis peers bad a problem with the news- 
paper. 

If our newspaper is fdlcd with pro. 
paganda. then why would we print the 
letters to ihe editor that are quite tnui.il

Anolher student complained because 
we put Michael Cunegin on the front 
page. We put Jill Long on the front 
page We also put Robert Scdlmeycr 
on Ihe front page Alt of these candi- 
dates are running in the upcoming May 
primary. 

I honestly have lo question what 
validity this complaint has Could 1 1 he 
that Cunegin is African -Am eric an and 
■ bat most of Ihe lime African- 
Americans make the front page il is due 
10 tbe fact Ibat they are reported as 
stealing something or being involved in 
some type of drug and ganj; activity?

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q: Just how effective 
are condoms at 
preventing AIDS? 

A: Recent studies show 
that latex condoms, used 
correctly and consistently, 
do prevent the 
transmission of HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS. 
They also prevent the 
transmission of other STDs 
such as syphilis and 
gonorrhea. Animal 
membrane condoms 
should NOT be counted on 
to prevent STDs.

Violent Femmes are fablulous in concert 



by Jamie Cr*ver 
Staff Writer 

Well, if you were lucky enough to 
read 'Alternative View' last week than 
you know lhal I attended the Violent 
Femme* concert last Thursday. 

This band out of Milwaukee reared 
its warped bead in 1981 and released id 
Tint album in 1983. Tbc band has since 
attracted a large cult following and uses 
an interesting blend of rock and folk 

They arc loved for tbeir self-pro- 
claimed, individualistic and "I'm a 
loser" lyrical proclamations. The lead 
singer, Gordan Guno, has a vociferous, 
almosl wtnn, voice that mixes well with 
tbc strange, experimental music of the 

The concert was held in the athletic 
gymnasium at Valparaiso University 
and was performed on a very moderate 
stage with likewise lighting and sound 
effects. It was a nice change of pace 
from your usual big stadium rock con- 
cert because it gave a sort of intimate 
feeling with the audience lo the band 
and their music Tbc reserved seating in 
the gymnasium fdlcd quickly. 

There were chairs on tbc floor but 
by halfway through the second song 
every last chair bad been hoisted and 
passed lo Ibe back of the gym. 

The band stalled off with some new 
songs that will be coming out on their 
soon lo be released album. But you 



could tee i ipirk in Gano's eyes when 
be tuned to roll out some of the older 
tunes The crowd went nuts when they 
performed "Blister in the Sun." and 
"Kiss off" and the crowd really had the 
mosh pits in full swing when they per- 
formed, my personal favorile, "Add It 
Up." 

Tbc crowd did seem lo be, for Ihe 
most part, there more for Ibe mere 
chance to gel wild at a concert and 
moth all wound rather than to truly 
enjoy Ihe music. I noticed a lot of very 
young people who I highly doubi were 
even familiar wilh the band's music 
But ihe crowd did really get into Ihe 
concert and there seemed lo be no 
injuries or Tights. 

At one stage of the concert the light- 
ing turned slowly lo a very deep dark 
red color lhal was centered on Gordon 
Gano and which made him look quite 
like a devil up on stage. 

And, while dodging a number of 
shoes thrown onto the stage, the band 
experimented with a song thai they had 
never performed before titled 
"Machine." During this song a violin 
was used along with a strange, long

Professor comments on Jehl Memorial Scholarship 



by Bob Gillespie 
Assistant Protestor of Biology 

Al inc. lime '■( year. Ihe School of 
Aria and Sciences honors our best stu- 
dent* by presenting Ibem witb award* 
.ir.il scholarships at the Annual Scbool 
of Am and Science Awards Banquet ]&lt; 
wu my pleasure to present the award* 
under the stewardship of the 
Department of Biology at Ibif year* 
banquet- Maybe it was my un/amiliarity 
witb such attain, or maybe it was my 
unpreparedneit, or maybe it was juii 
plain urn...' But. I feci as though I did 
not adequately honor the lack Jehl II! 
Memorial Scholarship as it deserves 

Jack Jehl graduated from III W in 
1988. majoring In prc-medicine, but 
died of cancer before beginning bis 
medical education. Although 1 never 



met lack Jehl. I know the type of stu- 
dent that Jack typifiei Jack Jehl was in 
his 30's wben be ended a successful 
business in construction to pursue bis 
academic goals at IPFW Therefore, be 
is what we call a "no n- traditional" stu- 
dent, which is a polite way of saying 
that Jack was older than our average 
undergraduate at II'IW More important 
than age, non-traditional students are 
those who for many reasons have decid- 
ed later in life to pursue academic goals 
that were either not formulated yet, rep- 
resent a change in career pursuits, or 
were put on hold due to life'* circum- 
stances I am sure that I speak for many 
faculty when I say that it is truly 
rewarding to teach and work with non- 
traditional students because of their 
high motivation, clear focus on their 



goals, and mature perspective of the 
value of their education. 

The Jack Jehl 111 Memorial 
Scholarship is awarded annually to a 
non- traditional student majoring in pre- 
medicine. As was the case this year, in 
years when there are no non -traditional 
candidates, we award the scholarship to 
a more traditional pre-med student. 
However, the Jebl Memorial 
Scholarship is special because it recog- 
ni2cs a population of students wbo are a 
significant part of the IPFW communi- 
ty. After years at other more traditional 
universities and colleges, 1 am thor- 
oughly impressed with the success with 
which IPFW has served non -traditional 
students. 

The Jack Jehl HI Memorial 
Scholarship his honored non- traditional 



students wbo have either completed, arc 
in the process of completing, or are 
about to begin their medical education. 
This scholarship is awarded to a pre 
medicine major because this was Ibe 
goal of non-traditional student Jack 
Jehl. However, because of tbeir gen- 
erosity and recognition of the impor- 
tance that IPFW played in Jack Jehl's 
life, the Jehl family has recognized all 
non -traditional students and recognized 
the very important role that IPFW plays 
in serving these important members of 
our community For this service, we 
thank the Jebl family I regret that I 
never met Jack. Jehl, but more impor- 
tantly I regret not having expressed 
these thoughts on April 22, '94 at the 
Arts and Sciences Banquet

the recent death of rock star Kurt 
Cobaln of Nirvana has left them a little 
shaken up. 

And for the very few that do not 
already know some of the bands that 
will be attending this year's 
Lollapaloo/a here is a list of some of 
the main bands: Smashing Pumpkins. 
L7, Beaslic Boys, George Clinton, The 
Breeders, and possibly look for a lost 
second decision for Pomo for Pyros to 

And on a final, very important 
note: Thursday, April 21. was Robert 
Smith's 35th birthday. So I send a 
happy birthday to one of our greatest 
singer/songwriters. That's all for Ibis 
year, so have a great summer and hope 
to sec you next year.

some passible Yoruba. He can oclually 
make conversation, that is, be bos gone 
beyond the phrase- book level. So you 
see, languages con be learned Cultures 
are learned Uw: they do not run in the 
blood or repose in the skin or in skin 
color. Some would say all things are 
knowable but I would qualify that and 
say: Most things are knowable so we 
can learn everything if we try. 

Enough of preaching ! Go with God 
(or your Higher Power, the Creator, or 
the Great Spirit) however you con-

folks, Ibis is it in a nutshell We nn 
say things are fine and dandy with 
race relations, we can call it mulikut- 
turalism. political correctness or any 
other scapegoat slogan/title we want 
to call it. It is ilill racism Toe ever- 
pressing use of political correctness. 
multkulturalism and things of this 
nature are undertoned, submissive 
ways lo cupbemize and whitewash 
one clear and relevant issue — racism 
is alive and breeding babies. Blood 
runs through all that is human. 

We want to use titles and names to 
say one thing. It doesn't matter if you 
are Jewish. Christian, Muslim. 
Liberal, Feminist, Native- American 
or whatever, even if you are a punk 
rocker, hip-hopper, child or lesbian 
all say one Ibing- which means 
human. No matter what ethnic back- 
ground, religious orientation, color or 
sex people are still considered lo be 
human. (Using the term loosely) 
Nevertheless wilh the use of many 
titles come relevant and real issues 
To conserve things the way tbey were 
in tha past is ludicrous. Tunc cannot 
stand still, it moves on. Slavery of 
any form brings forth rebellion and 
here we ore on the eve of revolution. 



Black, Hispanic*. Allans, Whites 

and countless amounts of other ethnic 
groups are yelling lex freedom in i&gt;iu 
"democratic society." So now, in 
uproar, cilies axe burnt, looted and 
run over by all. Racing to the game, 
the revolution, is our American

Multicultural Retreat 



The Communicator 



Thur%da&gt; . April 28, 1 994 



Campus ministry and Multicultural services sponsor 
multicultural retreat 



By Amy Krach 
Gurst repurltr 

On (he third weekend of March. 
eleven tludenii and live .i.ii'i' member* 
from Muliicullural Service* and 
Cam put Ministry came together for an 
amazing experience, an experience 
which hai changed lives, That experi- 
ence wa&gt; Ibc II IV.' Muliicullural 
Rttrealof 1994. 

The group met at Camp 
Lulherhaven. norlh of Fori Wayne. 
Students bad a chance (o gel lo know 
each other on the short trip up there and 
by Ihe lime we (finally) reached our 
destination, conversation was flowing 
easily. The firs! activity was begun by 
Sister Morybeth Martin. II was a game 
to remember names, which was helpful 
in making the new acquaintances. A 
discussion with Ken "Coop" Co op wood 
and Tim Lake from muliicullural ser- 
vices was followed by an activity that 
allowed all to show pride in the groups 
we belonged lo. including some groups 
we had never thought about being in 
before. From this, we began to piece 
together some of our thoughts on diver- 
sity in a list (for the complete rundown, 
see the end of this article) Afterwards, 
we were afforded one of the many large 
spaces of free lime we got throughout 
the weekend. These were a lot of fun as 



students got to know each other better 
playing games, dancing to music from 
the various cultures, and doing what we 
do best, talking 

Many of the activities were fun and 
enlightening On Saturday nighl each 
person in the group was given lime to 
stand up and tell a little bit about their 
culture, presenting music, stories and 
traditions. This activity was led by 
Paulina Salvador from Multicultural 
Services. 

Others were on o more serious note. 
In an activity called Speak Outs, Cheryl 
Peterson, campus minister, invited sev- 
eral people to tell a story of t lime when 
they experienced prejudice or discrimi- 
nation. These stories were an opportuni- 
ty for some healing for those who bad 
been wronged. They also permitted us 
as a group to recognize that prejudice is 
alive and well and present on our cam- 
pus and in our community. We learned 
more about Ihe subtleties of discrimina- 
lion-and perhaps some of the ways we 
have been offensive to others. It certain- 
ly builds up our convictions lo do some- 
thing about the injustice: which exists, 

We all need opporlunitics lo team 
more about olher cultures. Even those 
who allempt lo be open to those who 
are different from themselves can often 
be prejudiced in ways they were not 
aware of. There are so many messages 



our society leaches us that it is difficult 
sometimes lo distinguish the truth from 
.hype. This is why we need so much to 
interact wilh many different people — to 
force us to take a closer look at our- 
selves and the messages we have 
recorded throughout our lives. This is 
not to excuse even subtle racism and 
prejudice, because these kinds can often 
be more dangerous than Ihe olher, and 
the best ways to Fight them are close 
introspection and first hand experience. 
That's what this weekend was all about. 
Weekends like this arc helpful because 
they give people time to really gel to 
know one another as we share meals, 
free lime, our lives, actually — some- 
thing we don't always freely choose lo 
do when given the opportunity, 

"Yeah, so what are you going to do 
about it?" I hear asking. "You're just 
like ail the rest of those politically cor- 
rect meetings — all talk and no action. 
That's so pathetic." Yeah, we all know 
about those pretty plans everyone is 
always coming up wilh all the lime 
which never get off the pretty paper 
they're printed on, they're all loo typi- 
cal today. We're hoping this weekend 
does more lhan thai. Here is what we've 
done: On Wednesday, April 21. we held 
a luncheon in Ibe fireside lounge in 
Walb, we hope you came and talked to 
us and gave us some of your ideas; after 



all. making a difference starts with you. 
If anything, we hope you came for Ibe 
free popcorn and checked out our dis- 
play table while you were there. You 
couldn't have missed our banner which 
read "See every one again for the first 
time" in Spanish, Vijav's language from 
the Fiji Islands, and English. Can all 
this really moke a difference? We think 
it can, but it all depends on us, Ihe stu- 
dents. Our ideas are practical, things we 
as students can practice. So now it's our 
turn lo ask you — "What are you going 
lo do about prejudice and racism on this 

world?" We suggest you lake a real 
good look in Ibe mirror, plan some 
changes within yourself, because every- 
one has prejudices in their recordings. 
Take a look at our list and think of ways 
you might be able to use it, and think 
about maybe joining us on this retreat 
next year because the more diverse we 
are, ihe better our retreat is, the better 

DIVERSITY DIALOGUE 

1 . How does diversity affect us? 

-"We have enough resources to do 
the right thing." 

-"Our commonalities exist beyond 
the boundaries." 

-"Diversity doesn't mean forgetting 



our humanity " 

-"To appreciate diversity, I must 
appreciate/love my own diversity." 

"Diversity is a self-fulfilling 
prophecy." 

-"Being integrated into different 
groups breaks the stereotypes " 

-"Botlom line, everyone needs a 
sense of self." 

-"The differences are what you make 

-"United we stand, divided we fall." 
-"Altitude, daily attitude, is impor- 
tant." 

-"See everyone again for the first 

-"We should be flexible, open and 

lions — internal and cxiemol." 

-"Don'l assume the role equals the 
person." 

-"You must first know yourself lo 
know others," 

-"Growth comes after pain, struggle, 
effort and pushing beyond the 
boundaries." 

-"The more we know of others, the 
more we know of ourselves." 

•"Diversity doesn't prohibit your 



"Be willing to make and forgive 
mis lakes." 

-"Have a child's mind — open." 
-"Stretch our world's view." 
"Make every encounter a teachable 
moment. Actively listen, don't attack " 
"Be willing to dialogue and listen "

-Ask questions and be willing lo 

ABOUT PEOPLE
