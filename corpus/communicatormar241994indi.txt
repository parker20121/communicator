Panel encourages open discussion 



by Dodlc Miller 
Chief Reporter 

The dreary weather of the first day 
of spring was eclipsed by an hour of 
enligblment in Kcttler Hall. 

On March 21 in G 41 in Kcitler 
Hall, a panel discussion on the topic of 
gender perspectives was held. Included 
among Ihe six member sludenl panel 
were Ramona McGown; editor-in-chief 
of the Communicator, and Chris Douse. 
a Student Government senator. The 
discussion was led by Molara 
Ogundipe- Leslie, director of Women's 
Studies. "The primary objective (of the 
panel disccussion). is lo generate infor- 
mation," said Ogundipe. 

The panelist stressed thai the discus- 



"Sadly, there are far loo 
many lales of women's 
issues being placed behind 
those that were male-ori- 
ented." 

— Chris Douse 

sion was more than a 'gripe-session', 
and wanted those wbo participated in 
the informative talk to offer solutions lo 
circumvent gender bias. 

"Sadly, there are far too many tales 
of u-omen's issues being placed behind 
those that were male-oricnied; under 
Ihe guise of broadening one's perspec- 
tive," said Chris Douse, an IPFW stu- 



denL 

Many at tbe discussion said IPFW 
has far lo go before it can truly consider 
itself a "fair" campus. 

The point of most consternaiion, 
frustration, and even anger, among bolh 
panelists and audience members, was 
that of childcarc. The point was made 
that : "Lack of childcarc is a form of 
gender bias, and should be an embar- 
rassment (to the administration)"

STAFF EDITORIAL 



Revisionists reject historical facts of Holocaust 



It has been approximately 
50 years since the Holocaust 
and certain individuals claim 
it never happened 

Calling themselves 

"Revisionists," they are trying 
to claim the genocide of Jews 
never happened, or that they 
died from other diseases such 
as "typhus," not from being 
gassed. These "revisionists" 
will try all sort of tactics or 
maneuvers to try and side- 
track the real issue. They real- 
ly give no justification as to 
why they take this stand. 
This is another form of big- 
otry. 

Ernst Zundell was on last 
week's 60 Minutes expressing 
his "revisionist" propaganda. 

We need to be aware and 



These "revisionists" 
will try all sort of 
tactics or maneuvers 
to try and side-track 
the real issue. 



remember that this atrocity 
against the Jewish people did 
happen and voice our con- 
cern. We should not forget it, 
nor allow our children, or our 
children's children to forget 
the Nazis wartime crimes. 

The U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum was 
established recently in 



Washington, D.C. to remind 
us of the horrors the Nazis 
were allowed to perform dur- 
ing World War II. 

This kind of fanaticism still 
exists with letters being dis- 
tributed asking for open 
debate on the gas chambers. 

Millions of Jews died and 
now "revisionists" are asking 
for open debate? How many 
lives had to be lost before 
they accept what is fact. 

By avoiding the real issue 
and claiming that there is no 
evidence of gas chambers, 
"revisionists" assert that the 
Holocaust never happened. 

Today, even in Munich, 
where Hitler launched his 
dark career, a museum was 
established portraying pho-

tographs of his activities, 
thereby exposing that these 
atrocities happened. 

So on behalf of the approx- 
imately six million Jews mur- 
dered during World War II, 
individuals and groups alike 
should stand against "revi- 
sionist" racists, for the past 
and for the future. 



Frightened student 
dreads summer violence 



by Rarnona Mcgown 
Ediior In chief 

As Ihe warm weather approaches, 
I nervously til and dread Ihe next 
obituary thai I will have to read, I 
even try to mentally prepare myself 
for (he pain if it so happens that the 
person is a loved one or close friend. 

Some area ministers have taken it 
upon themselves to stand and become 
community leaders. I have a question 
for tbose persons. 

Who asked them lo speak for the 
community? Why is it that every lime 
there is a crisis in Ihe inner cily, the 
media chooses lo identify these per- 

These same persons arc only loo 
often the hypocrites and persons that 
seem lo be selling out Ihe community 
as a whole. Why is it that when [bey 
are faced with the problems of 
African-Americans tbey frequently 
focus directly on how "religion" can 
help (he problem? If ihey were deal- 
ing with the killings in a realistic 
manner, then Ihey would address Ihe 
young men and women thai are being 
affected by ihe problems daily? 

Then tbcre is a local radio station 
where people can call in and voice 



Commentary 



and solutions. This is 
very productive and inventive, bul 
let's look at the station itself First, 
■his particular station has in one way 
blatantly decided lo alienate many of 
Ihe youth lhat they seem so concerned 
about. They state very clearly thai il 
is a station that will not play rap 
music, and ibis is the very same 
music with which ihcsc young men 
and women often identify with. 

But I guess if a communily does 
not own its black radio station there 

effectively be made, 

I honestly feel the only people 
who can effectively deal wilb tbe 
young African- American men in ihe 
community causing havoc, are tbe 
older African -American men. 

African-American women must 
stop putting down our black men in 
fronl of our sons. They are hearing 
the harsh words much Jquder than we 
think and we are seeing their behavior 
manifest this truth.

Comment of the week: 

"There is perhaps one human being in a thousand who is 
passionately interested in job for the job's sake. The differ- 
ence is that if that one person in a thousand is a man. we 
say. simply, that he is passionately keen on his job; if she

Letter to the editor 

'A few bad apples should not represent the barrel. 



Dear Editor. 

I am writing this letter in response to 
your article "'Hypocrisy often lies with- 
in Christianity." 

Let me sian by saying that I agree 
with some of what you are saying. 
There are hypocritical Christians and 
there have been hypocritical Christians 
throughout history. These are Ihe sort of 
Christians you and Michelle (who 
wrote the letter on gay-bashing) are 
talking about. However. I think that this 
is a case, to use an old clichf. of "a few 
bad apples spoiling Ihe whole barrel." 
The problem lies in thai it is usually Ihe 
bad apples who get everyone's atten- 
tion. I am a Christian and the majority 
of the Christians I have mel have been 
loving, caring and supportive people. 
lhat is why I choose to remain a 
Christian and declare my Christianity 
despite its increasingly bad reputation- 
Just last weekend 1 attended an 
IPFW multicultural retreat in which I 



r Cbristiai 



■tile 



address some of the things which are 
said about us as a grouprand some of 
what we talked about pertained to that 
bad reputation lhat is quickly becom- 
ing a stereotype in our nation. For 
instance, we said that we are not all 



far-right 

all judge others. 

In your article you cited some exam- 
ples in Ihe past and present of some 
Christians' hypocritical actions, and I 
agree with you thai they are hypocritical, 
but I must stress lhat / There are a lol of 
Christians in Ihe pro-life movement, and 
there arc a lot of Christians who believe 
homosexuality and sex education in the 
schools is wrong, and while I totally dis- 
agree with them I need to acknowledge 
their right to believe that and to acl on 
thai belief. However. I do strongly disap- 
prove of any hale-filled, violent acts 
anyone commits, be they Christian or 
otherwise. 

I would have lilted you to include in 
your article a few of the many good 
things Christians have done as well as 
your criticism of il such as the number 
of Christians involved in tbe Tight for 
rights for Native-Americans, and the 
millions of Christians who volunteer 
their lime and effort for worthy causes 

The important thing to remember is 
that not all Christians are hypocrites 
and not all hypocrites are Cbristians- 
Tbere have been a lol of bxl things said 
and done in ihe name of God. but I 



think thai the number of good things 
done for the same reason has fax, far 
outweighed them. If anyone is interest- 
ed in knowing some specific instances 
or would like to get involved in doing 
something good for God, right here on 
campus, I invite you to get in contact 
wilh the Campus Ministry, on the third 
floor of Helmke Library. 



Lastly, I'd like to commend you on 
your statement that whal Christians and 
everyone needs lo do is build thctr own 
personal relationship wilh God. I Ihink 
thai it makes a world of difference 

Thank you from a pro-choice, pro- 
gay rights, pro-sex education, feminist, 
liberal. Christian.

Q: How do you feel race relations are on this campus? 






Adam A. Brown 
Freshman 

"I really haven't 
noticed any precon- 
ceived bias by most 
IPFW students, but 
my classes are pre- 
dominately white. I 
feel thai the environ- 
ment that people are 
in is what shapes a 
person's beliefs and 
IPFW tries really hard 
not to discriminate." 




Doug Carroll 
Freshman 

"1 believe that race 
relations on campus 
are just fine, although 
I believe the 
Communicator is 
filled with editorials 
and other articles that 
make it appear as 
though there are big 
problems." 



Kevia Sims

A Dose of Douse 

A sad commentary on life 



If there is anything thai I have 
learned m life it is the fact lhat there 
is a time to speak and a time to be 
quiet. I think it is about lime we. as 
a community, begin to speak out 
against any injustice that takes 
place whether it is on Ihis campus 
or in this community. People need 
to stand for what is right. Wc, as 
human beings, can no longer sil idle 
and allow atrocities to continue to 
take place in Ihis country, on this 
campus, and in our community. 

Earlier Ihis year there was a ter- 
rible accident in New York in 
which a person of color shot and 
murdered several white people on a 
train. Now. some people would 
consider this person to be sick and 
dcmcnled. Some people would 
probably think what else would you 
expect from him, he's black, isn'l 
he? 

When I look at Ihe incident, I do 
not sec any of those things. 1 sec a 
political statement being made I 
sec an African-American man wbo 
is no longer going to tolerate the 
unfair, in humane treatment of peo- 
ple of color no more. 

If I bad lo put it into one state- 
ment, I would say, "The hunting 
season on jungle bunnies is no 
longer in season. Now the prey is 
going after the predator." 

j know something 
else. It actually fell good to finally 
sec Ihe tables turn. For while folk to 
actually see and feel what African- 
Americans goes through on a day to 
day basis, I'm not talking about the 
murder in particular, I'm talking 
about the lack of respect for Ihe 
lives of African -American people in 
Ihis country thai was founded on 
Christian values. 

Dy ibis time I expect some 
white folk to be upset if not out- 
raged at the suggestion that it's 
okay for a black lo shoot and kill 
innocent white people without 
regard to Ihcir lives. And if you are 
good, because you're now feeling 
S that you have never had to 



experience. Now you know what il 
feels like to see political statements 
made and have no way of even 
combating them became society 
docs have a problem with iL If you 
don't believe look at Rodney King 
Even with the video tape, those 
police officers were left off the 
hook originally by the jury which 
sent the message that there is no 
regard or respect for the lives of 
people of color in the United States 
of America. The only way some 
justice was served was when Ihe 
LA Four were brought up on 
charges of violating his civil rights. 

But that's not the point of this 
article. 

The point of this article is lo 
make people aware of the fact that 
the shooting in New York is not an 
isolated incident, il is situation lhat 
may become a reality to all citizens 
of the United Slates. 

Why do I soy lhat? Well, Ihe 
longer I live ihe more people I 
come in contact with, the more I 
realize lhat the madness is still 
alive. And I'm talking just about 
racism. I'm talking about sexism 
and homophobia. 

If you don't know what I am 
talking about, take this inlo consid- 
eration. People will say African- 
American people arc citizens of Ihe 
United States. Yet, they fail to real- 
ize thai Congress passed the 13 
ent in 1S6S. the 14th 
cnt in 1868. the Civil 
Rights Act in 1964. and just in 1991 
amended the Civil Rights Act in 
1991. Now, if black folk arc consid- 
ered citizens, why do they &lt; 
to make these changes. See, it's 
things like thai we don'l 

Look at the recent incident that 
look place in Gas City wilh the new 
gay that just opened. Oh, those 
white folks were highly upset that 
those "people" had infiltrated their 
ity. These good folk of 
Indiana were holding up signs such 
as "Honk, if you're not gay!" But

Movie Review 



Ace is a success 



by Jennifer Skinner 
SUIT writer 

Have you ever lo« a pel? A dbj, ■ 
ol err maybe a goldfish? (Well, maybe 
not a goldfish) If so. then you probsbl) 
know the unfortunate truth lh..i flyers 
stapled to telephone polei merely blow 
haplessly in the wind, and the lost pet 
ads in the classified go unanswered, if 
nol unread. 

So where could you possibly lum to 
find help wilh the icarch for your lost 
pet? The yellow pages are not likely to 
reveal any alternative for you and your 
lost Fluffy or Snookuim or Bandit— 
certainly you won't find an ad for a pel 
detective. 

But Ihot-s reality We're talking 
movies, here — Warner Brothers' "Ace 
Ventura: Pel Detective," specifically. 

The movie stars Jim Carrey, belter 
recognized as a cast member on Fox 
network's "In Living Color" than as 
Miami pet detective Ace Ventura. 

As ihe movie opens, the Miami 
Dolphins hire Ventura to find the 
team's missing mascot, a dolphin, 
before the SupcrBowl The mascot 
Snowflake has mysteriously disap- 
peared from his home, an enormous 
lank at Ihe stadium 

Two elements carry the plot further; 
a love-hate relationship (a favorite 
Hollywood device) between client and 



professions]— II the eccentric Ventura 
can be compared U a profcisionil, lhat 
U. Second, and more imrvrUnt it the 
disappearance of Dolphin 4 u art tr tacit 
Dan Marino, for who Ventura alio 
searches. 

In an attempt to uncover the culprit 
responsible for both disappearances. 
Ventura and the Dolphins' chief publi- 
cist, played by courtney Cox, are chas- 
ing millionaire Ronald Camp (Lido 
Kier) and the Dolphin football players. 

Because Carrey's portrayal of 
Ventura (hows us a bizarre and overly 
hyper man, his senseless, abnormal 
adventures fit perfectly with his abnor- 
mal behaviors It is impossible nol to 
laugh at Ventura's ridiculous mishaps 

Ventura shares his apartment with 
more animals than a zookceper would 
be able to manage. These animals seem 
to have as many human characteristics 
as Ventura has animal characteristics, 
ihcir personalities blending into one 
quirky persona 

While this movie is extremely comi- 
cal, the storyline lends to be misreprc- 
senlcd to ihe audience. The title alone 
quickly draws children to the box 
office. But the previews and commer- 
cials fail to show one important aspect 
of Ventura's life: his sexual a

Aunt Louise confronts racist, tells student to act like a man 




Dear Aunt Louise, 

Hey Ann' Louise, I have a question 
for youT Wby is il that tome men just 
can't gel ihcir set together. I meet to 
many arc indecisive! At Tint ihey like 
you, then ihey don't. They can't make 
up their damn mindi, I'm. like, lo the 
point that moil men juil don't know 



wbtt they want period 

Wbit ibould [ do? Continue to hive 
faith in men or become t nun? 

Sincerely, 
When Arc Ibe Real Men? 

Dear Where Arc the Real Men, 

Now, dearie, don't you think that 

becoming a nun is just a bit too much? I 
hope so because. I could ceiuinly never 
become one myself. 

About thii here men problem. I'll 
(ell you ibis much. Most men know 
what they want and who they want. 
What most men have a problem doing 
ii expressing their feelings correctly to 
us, women. Sec, tbey have been trained 
by their papas not to show any reeling' 
or emotion, where as we ore encoraged 
top snow those very feelings. 

Personally. I think the best thing for 
you to do is just walk right up to that 
there young lad you're interested in and 
say, "Look, I really don't have time for 



all of the games Do you like me or 
not7" 

You see. I am slowly changing with 
this new generation. I am beginning to 
realize that some women just need to 
tell these little rascals bow it is. We 
don'l bave time for mind games. We 
want to find males for a lifetime. Why. 
you know, Dorcui and I bave been 
together for yean and years? I think 
honesty is what keeps us together- hon- 
esty and love. 

Honey-dew, just tell him like it is 

Your loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

I just found out that my girlfriend is 
pregnant and I am stuck. I am too 
young to be a parent. I want to finish 
my college education first and then 
have a family. My girlfriend on the 
other hand wants this baby. 

1 want to do the right thing, but I do 
not know what it is. What should I do? 



A Dose of Douse from page 4 



that's alright because these folks 
normal, right? However, 
ty did bave o problem when the club 
woi previously a strip joint in which 
women were disrespected and pawed 
at, of course that it a part of the 
American Dream, right? I won't go 
there. 

Bock to our block gunmen, I don'l 
feel like this man was showing a disre- 
gard for life. Ho was jusi expressing his 
outrage at the condition of black folk in 
America in Ibe moil common way 
known to Americans, violence. He just 
lost control. His losing control does not 
condone bis violent actions in which 
Innocent people were murdered, but it 
does present a sad commentary on the 
way this country has dehumanized 
human beings lo the level of lavages. 



The saddest part is 
that the only time an 
issue is addressed is 
when someone has died. 

The saddest part is that the only 
time an issue is addressed is when 
someone bas died. If you don't believe 
look at Port Wayne, this city has just 
undergone five homicides within the 
some week. People are calling it a phe- 
nomenon. How in the hell do tbey con- 
sider these killings to be a phenome- 
non? 

If a person is from Detroit or 
Washington, DC. this is not a phenom- 
enon, it is a fact of life. If a person Lives 



in the infamous community called 
Cabrini Green, this would be a fact of 
life 

This is no phenomenon this is the 
society's way of showing us that the 
biggest cause of all of this violence is 
the lack of respect for the value of life. 
This lack of respect is engraved in 
American consciousness and must be 
removed just like a cancer. 

So, how do we remove this cancer? 

I don't know. Maybe by start treat- 
ing people like (hey are human. Maybe 
by understanding people and their dif- 
ferences. Maybe by respecting and tak- 
ing people as is. Maybe by (aking a 
stand for a cause. A cause in which we 
don't just look out for ourselves but a 
cause in which we look out for the 
human race as a whole. 



Father lobe or not? 

Dear Father to be or do(? 

Oh, sonny, you have a terrible prob- 
lem. I will try my best to help you with 
the situation. First, you do not want to 
get rid of Ibis little life that is growing 
inside of your girlfriend. It is not the 
baby's fault Ibat it is here. You two 
probably should have considered using 
some type of binb control. You should 
have wajled until you were married, but 
I will not get into that because that is a 
different issue 

It sounds like your girlfriend is not 
going to have an abortion so you need 
to accept the fact that your baby is on 
Ibe way. You have two choices, lad. 
You can support the child financially 
and leave them alone, or you can raise 
the child with the mother as a family. 

I can tell you this much, once your 
girlfriend bas ber baby and you see it.

NCAA Volleyball championship time rolls around 



hy Jennifer Skinner 
Sports Editor 

For the second lime since 1988, the 
NCAA Volleyball Championships will 
bo held in Fort Wayne. 

"The primary reason (choosing Fort 
Wayne) is because the Bicentennial 
Committee, of which I'm part of 
through the sports corporation, asked if 
we would be interested in having a 
NCAA mojor event in town and helping 
celebrate the bicentennial." said Head 
Coach Amie Ball. 

Since Ihe first NCAA Volleyball 
Championships that were held in Fort 
Wayne were successful. Ball and his 
staff decided to attempt lo repeat their 
good fortune again. And, on May 6-7 
Ihe 25(h Annual NCAA Tournament 
will be held at Ihe Allen County War 
Memorial Coliseum. 

On May 1, the team schedules for 
tournament play will be selected. 

For the remainder of the season, 
Ball feels Ihe games left will be a 
"springboard" into Ihe postseason com- 
Dciition for ibe Volleydons. 

"The fact that we play a very com- 
petitive schedule, I think adds to Ihe 
strength of our team and gels them pre- 
pared lo play in the conference and 
hopefully the NCAA Tournament at the

Another area Ball feels that needs 
improvement is with the leam's defense 
because it is not real strong. Therefore, 
the team is devoting a lol of lime to 
both defense and serving before the 
NCAA Tournament.
