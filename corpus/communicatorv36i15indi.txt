In 2003. Fort Wayne was dubbed the 
nation's Fattest City by Men's Fitness 
magazine. 

Monday, the popular magazine released 
the top 25 fattest city and Fort Wayne was 



(ranked in at number 11). 

Before lunch most students have 
usually had a class or two and checked 
their email. For junior marketing major 
and softball player Kacie Stone, working 
out before lunch is just another added task 
on herTo-Oo list for the day. 

"1 started working out when I was old 
enough to realize what was going on, what 
to do," said Stone. "My family is really into 

Around Fort Wayne faculty and students 
who wish to work out have ample choice 
lo do it. Over 30 facilities, not including 
educational instutitions, offer their 
sei vices for people of all ages and abilities. 

At IPFW students can acess Gates by 
showing their student ID, 

" I here are a lot of students who come 
in." said Stone, "I think that not having to 
pay for a membership gets them in there 
(Gates)." 

Although some students believe that 



their acess to Gates is 'free', it is stated that 
the fee is applied to each students bill at 
the beginning of the semester. 

For those in the Fort who like to be part 
of a team the Spiece Fieldhouse might be 
the ticket. 

For a comparable price to what IPFW 
charges students to use Gates, Speice 
offers more equipment, larger facilities, 
and intermaruaJ team sports year-round. 

"I'm pretty sure that those people who 
are just out to lose weight do their cardio 
{at Gates)," said Stone. "But those who 
want to be involved and play sports like 

I, would probably enjoy 



IPFW also offers fitness classes for a 
small fee. Students and faculty can take 
Yoga, body conditioning, strengthening 
and stretching, or a mixture of the above.

In addition to the classes offered 
at IPFW, smitiar classes are being held

"You can't win In the long run

The summit comes after declining

"If the politicians turn to the

A similar approach to increasing 
American's knowledge of "strategic

"It's important to offer broad

Congress favors bill

Dubbed the "reconciliation

The Fulbrighi Program was created 
after President Harry S. Truman signed the 
bill into law on August 1, 1946. Senator I.

Wanted: varied food selection 



Staff Editorial 



It has been a long day of 
classes. You're tired, you're 
hungry, you're busy, and you 
have a billion things to do. So, 
like most college students, you 
just stop in the school cafeteria, 
use your meal plan, and get 

Well, you say, I would, but 
1PFW doesn't have a cafeteria, 
a dining hall, or any type of 
meal plan, whatever you 
chose to call it. Even with the 
addition of student housing to 
this campus, no meal plan has 
been added for students. 

Students, especially those 
living on campus, could use 
the help of a meal plan. We 
understand, because we know 
from experience. 

Sometimes you simply do 
not have much time to cook. Or 
maybe you just don't want to; 
finding something to eat every 
night is not a small problem for 
some college students. 



Buying groceries is another 
pain of not having a dining 
hall. Sure, if you commute 
to school then perhaps you 
are living at home and your 
parents still provide the food. 
Or maybe you are a returning 
adult and already used m fixing 
meals and buying groceries. 
But, there are many of us that 
don't live at home and aren't 
used to providing for ourselves 



is true that we all have i 

shopping and cooking c 



with a meal plan groceries 
would still be bought. People 
would still cook; just not all 
the time. For most, a dining 
hall would just be used as a 
helpful place to eat quickly 
and maybe a little healthier, 
without having to add extra 
stress to busy days. 

Of course, we have Taco Bell, 
Pizza Hut, and Subway. Don't 



get us wrong; We love thosi 
additions to our campus. We'n 
just saying it isn't economical 
for us, or even healthy, 
consider them some sort 
school cafeteria. Even adults 
and commuters might be 
interested in a smaller meal 
plan— that way when they a 
stuck on campus all eveni: 
they don't have to worry about 
bringing a lunch or dinner. 

Instead of wasting so much 
money on building a walking 
bridge across the river to 
soccer fields, IPFW should 
spend some money to build z 
new dining hall. That would be 
money well spent. 

A dining hal! would be a 
good addition to our campus. 
It would be a good way to make 
it feel more like an "ordinary" 
university. With the right 
kinds of plans and with good 
promotion, a meal plan could 
be a huge success at IPFW.

However, we also saw progress the last

many players left the program. For IPFW to 
continue lo grow on the court, they must 
stay die course. Yeah, I might sound like a 
minute-man from the Revolutionary War.

Last year, the future looked bright with 
a young floor leader in Beau Bauer and a 
sniper from the outside in Pete Campbell. 
Both were young with tremendous upside 
that could have anchored the IPFW 
backcourt for years to come. Sadly, both 
transferred out of die program, with Bauer 
heading to Florida GuIfCoast and Campbell 

Two years ago, promising players such 
as Ric Wyand and Tyler Clcvenger left after 
a 3-25 campaign. The Mastodons have 
been a "young" team for about four straight 
years, because as people leave the program, 
freshmen are asked to lake their place. 
IPFW has been unable to build a solid, 
uppcrclassman-dominaied team because 
of dii' defections. 

That is why it is so important for this 
year's team lo stay together. Chances are, 
Coach Dane Fife will make a few moves to 
make room on the roster for a few recruits, 
perhaps a JuCo or two to help out in the 
inside. But as far as players transferring 
or leaving the team, this isn't what the 
Mastodons need. It has happened too 
much in the past and it can be seen bow it 



has affected the next year. 

You can see the relationships growing on 
this team. The guards are learning forward 
Tyler Best's tendencies. Where he likes the 
ball, where he likes lo post up. In turn, the 
inside guys are learning where the guards 
set up and where they are most likely to 
hil an outside jumper. In short, they are 
learning things about each other that 
only come with continued practice and 
experience in playing with one another.

IPFW stepped up lire pressure defense and 
shot 62 percent from the field in the second 
hall, lopping the visitors. 75-61, in front of 
2.{&lt;?.i fans at Memorial Coliseum. 

The Thunder held a 34-30 halftime thanks 
to outhustling and outshooting a initial 
sluggish Mastodon squad. 

"We stunk it up in the first half." IPFW 
coach Dane Fife said, "I thought Tri-State 
came out ready to go and 1 thought we didn't. 
From player one all the way down the bench 
we weren't ready to go. That's ultimately the 
coach's fault. I've got to get them ready to go

game defining point as Northern Iowa took a 42-21 lead into the 
locker room. In the second half, (.assje llager took the lead to 
51-29 for Northern Iowa before IPFW mounted a small 12-8 run.
