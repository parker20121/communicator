Athletic department requests more money 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

The IPFW athletic department 
is proposing an increase in the 
student service fee, a deletion of 
the S30 service cap, and a larger 
cut of Ihe profits. 

According to Rajat Suri. 
IPSGA prcsidcni, the current 
sludcni service fee rate is S2.50 
pet credit hour with S30 being 
the maximum paid. 

Suri said the athletic depart- 
mcni wants to raise the service 
fee to S2.75 per credit hour next 
scmcsler, and raise it again to S3 
for the 1993-1994 school year. 

The aihlcljc department is also 
requesting the S30 limit be 
removed so students will pay 
strictly on a per credit hour 
basis. 

Currently the student service 
fee income is split SO/SO 



between the student government 
and the adiletic departmenL 

Arnie Ball, athletic director, 
declined to comment on the 
details of the plan. 

"This is strictly a proposal and 
negotiations. We have only had 
one informal meeting, " said 
Ball. 

Because IPFW athletics is fac- 
ing dire financial straits they 
have also asked siudeni govern- 
ment to give up a share of their 
funds. 

Next year the athletic depan- 
ment has proposed a 45/55 
break down in its favor, and 
for 1994-1995 wants a 40/60 
advantage. 

Suri said the proposal was dis- 
cussed at the student senate 
meeting last Monday. 
"Senators were asking what the 
needs are. They want to know 



whether or not a fee increase is 
justified," commented Suri. 

He said the senators are 
opposed to an unjustified fee 
increase because it is not a mat- 
ter of inflation nor a benefit to 
education. 

"We are already stretch- 
ing our dollars very far 
and it is unfair to ask us 
to stretch our money 
further." 
-Rajat Suri 

Suri said another reason they 
are opposed to the plan is 
because of the call for the 
removal of the S30 cap. 

Suri argued students taking a 
lot of credit hours aren't going 
to have as much time to spend 



on campus involved in extracur- 
ricular activities, 

"We want lo sec the athletic 
deparuncnt's budgcL They say 
ihey have one but we haven't 
seen it," Suri pointed out. 

Among other complaints, Suri 
said money problems arc always 
placed on students. Instead of 
raising service fees, Suri sug- 
gested individual departments 
implement tougher restraints 
and cut expenditures. 

Suri .said he doubts the athletic 
department is doing this, 

"We are already stretching our 
dollars very far and it is unfair 
to ask us to stretch our money 
further when other departments 
aren't doing the same," Suri 
said. 

Suri said the student govern- 
ment offers more benefits than 
the athletic department. 



"We fund a spectrum of 
cvenis. All clubs arc fully or 
partially funded by student gov- 
ernment. We bring a range of 
activities lo the sludenls, too." 
Sun said. 

He added sludcni government 
offers something for everyone. 
If student govemraenl funding is 
cut down, Suri said there will be 
a drop in campus activities. 

He noted die athletic depart- 
ment offers only one kind of 
entertainment while student 
govcmment covers the needs of 
all students. 

Meanwhile, student govern- 
ment and athletic department 
officials will meet soon to work 
out a Anancial agn^ment. 

Suri said, "Wc would like to 
figure out a middle of the road 
agreement that docs not burden 
the students." 



Campus collision 
leaves two dead, 
four injured 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

Two dead bodies and a pair 
of critically injured victims lit- 
lered the IPFW landscape last 
week, after an alcohol related 
parking lot colUsion. 

Luckily for the "victims," 
their injuries were not perma- 
nent. Their injuries were the 
result of a mock accident orga- 
nized by die IPFW chapter of 
the Society of Automotive 
Engineers, the IPFW police, 
the Substance Abuse Council, 
and InierVarsiiy Christian 
Fellowship, 

The collision was a demon- 
stration of the dangers of drunk 
driving and the response capa- 
bility of local emergency ser- 
vices. 

The "accident," which was 
staged in the parking lot 
between Neff Hall and Hclmke 
Library, drew a speedy 
response IJom local authorities 



including the IPFW police. 

Fort Wayne's police and fire 
units, the Allen County Sheriff 
and Parkview Memorial 
Hospital's Samaritan Air 
Rescue helicopter.

EduCare families organize to fight back 

University denies spot on task force 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

Parents aren't going to take 
IPFW's withdrawal from the 
child care consortium silting 
down. 

The EduCare Center, original- 
ly staned by IPFW, 
will lose the 
school's support at 
the end of the year. 

Administrators 
said the pull out 
was purely finan- 
cialilPFW simply 
couldn't afford to 
continue. 

Richard Ritchie. 
vice chancellor for 
financial affairs, further 
explained, "The child care pro- 
gram is not an academic pro- 
gram. It is an auxiliary program. 
It needs to make its own way 




Frank Borelli 



and at least break even. It is 
Simply our policy not to make 
Ihc taxpayers pay for our auxil- 
iary programs," 
The decision has left close to 
100 families scrambling for day 
care services. 

The school is 
putting together a 
list of day care cen- 
ters in Fort Wayne 
in an attempt to 
help out the parents, 
according to Marian 
Zimmerman, dean 
ofstudenis. 

However, par- 
ent Debbie Beck 
said most centers in 
Fort Wayne do not accept pan- 
lime users. 

Parent Lori Martin said most 
of die school's families who use 
the facility are pan-iime users. 



Over 30 people showed up at 
the Oct. 22 meeting that was 
held to discuss the situation. 

Martin led the discussion and 
is trying lo gel the parents rec- 
ognized as a student organiza- 
don. 

The parents have started circu- 
laiing petitions in an attempt to 
get IPFW to respond to their 
needs, according lo Manin. 

"The peiiiions are going a hi- 
de slower than I wanted, but wc 
still have time. We sianed col- 
lecting signatures last week. So 
far we have about 250." said 
Martin. 

Frank Borelli, vice chancellor 
for student affairs, said he 
would start a task force to sec 
what the school could do, 
according lo a memo released 
by Borelli. 

At the parents meeting, Beck

"We wanted to make this an

Base decision on facts 
in November election 



The conveniional wisdom of 
the conventional media states 
that you are too dumb lo know 
who to vote for. The only way 
you can make the correct deci- 
sion is to have your president 
spoon fed to you by slanted 
news and twisted editorials. 

We at The Communicator 
hope you are too smart for this. 
In this final issue before the 
November election our goal is 
to provide you with accurate, 
balanced coverage of the major 
candidates for the presidency. 

Hard sell negative campaign- 
ing and^lligerent spin-doclor- 
ing are the results of the 
media's bias, not the cause. 

True ignorance can only 
occur when you close your 
mind. Do not let one-sided, 
biased media coverage close 
your mind. 

Open your mind. Use your 
head. Cast your vote. The 
choice is yours. 

Bush 

George Bush, the incuinbenl, 
has been in office in the execu- 
tive branch for twelve years. 
His policies are supportive of 
free trade and call on America 
to be an economic superpower 
in the years ahead. 

Bush's staled goal of dou- 
bling the gross national product 
of the United Slates before the 
year 2000, while criticized for 
its optimism, is attainable 
through exierisive retooling of 
former defense contractors and 
the refocusing of America on 
becoming a world leader. 

Bush's experience in foreign 
affairs is his greatest asset and 
his mettie has been tested on a 
regular basis during his years 
in public life. He has passed 
[he tesL 

Clinton 

Arkansas Governor Bill 
Clinton, the democratic con- 
tender for the presidency, seeks 
to refonn government and put 
"people first. " His campaign 
has focused on "change" as a 
central theme and lo its credit, 
has publicized substantive 
plans 10 affect the changes he 
pnjposes. 

Clinton's views on foreign 
policy are generally proieciion- 



ist in nature and seek to save 
the middle class from further 
"trickle -down" economic dam- 
age. 

Clinton has improved 
Arkansas in many respects in 
his 12 years of service as 
Governor in such areas as edu- 
cation and job creation. Clinton 
hopes to do the same as the 
next president of the United 
States. 
Perot 

Ross Perot, an independent 
candidate for president, has 
focused on the national debt as 
a major point of contention in 
the 1992 campaign. 

Perot's plan for eliminating 
the debt over a five year period 
includes shared sacrifices on 
tax issues for the future eco- 
nomic benefit of the entire 
nation. 

Peroi was placed on the presi- 
dential ballot by volunteers in 
all SO Slates and has counted on 
their suppon throughout his 
campaign. 

Perot is an experienced busi- 
ness leader and an accom- 
plished entrepreneur He hopes 
10 apply his experience solving 
the economic problems facing 
America today 
Mannou 

Andre Mannou, the Ubertari- 
an candidate for president, 
offers severe governmental 
refonn as a platform and also 
appears on all 50 state ballots. 

Mannou seeks to minimize 
govertmienfs size, focus and 
powers in most instances. The 
libertarian platform supports 
the legalization of drugs to cut 
expenditures on the drug war 
and allow the American people 
freedom of choice in their per- 
sonal behavior. 

Mannou also suppons large 
scale cuts in all non-defensive 
(army, police) domestic pro- 
grams and seeks to pay off the 
national debt with these pro- 
gram cuts, not higher taxes.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 



Homosexual 

discrimmation 

'appalling' 

To the Editor: 

The responses to Greg 
Willson's comments about homo- 
sexuality made mc ashamed that I 
didn't write sooner. I, too, was 
appalled by his assertion that 
homosexuals "don't deserve 
rights." What has be done or not 
done to deserve fiis rights? 1 
knew I had to write when he used 
editorial space in the Oct. 22 edi- 
tion of The Communicator lo 
expand his hateful ideas. 

Those of us who disagree wilh 
that kind of narrow, prejudiced 
thinking need to speak out, or it 
will never change. Statistically 
speaking, 10 percent of the stu- 
dent body and faculty at IPFW is 
homosexual. Can't believe that 
there are that many gay people on 
campus? That's because a lot of 
them lie about who they are 
because they know that Greg 



"/ think the real problem 
will be solved when people 
stop misusing Christianity 
to spread hate." 



Wiltson isn't alone in his think- 
ing. 1 want them to know that 
most of us arc more accepting 
and compassionate than he is. 

By the way, Mr. Willson, I don't 
know when you took your psych 
class, but it must have been a 
long time ago, since it has been 
several years since homosexuality 
was considered a mental disorder. 
Sexual preference is a pan of who 
we are as a person. It should not 
be a characteristic which deter- 
mines whether or not we have the 
same rights as everyone else. 
You suggest that if ^1 homosexu- 
als would get AIDS and die, it 
would "solve the problem." I 
think the real problem will be 
solved when people like you stop 
misusing Christianity to spread 
hate.

Homosexual rights 



Hypocrisy greater evil 



To the Editor: 

I'm writing in response to Greg 
WiUson's letter in the Oct. 22 issue 
of The Communicator. 

Mr. Willson you are entitled to 
your own opinion. Just as I am enti- 
tled to mine, I think your "three 
major reasons" why homosexualily 
is wrong are very weak ones. To 
begin with, if you are going to try to 
convince us that you are correct, 
please do us die justice of having 
researched your subject. 

The physiological aspect of homo- 
sexuality is still being researched. 
The information on this subject is 
scarce. One element they have dis- 
covered in homosexual men that 
were studied were found to have 
above average sized glands found in 
the brain. This led researchers to 
believe that homosexuality is some- 
thing one is bom widi and not some- 
thing one chooses. 

Mr. Wilson, it doesn't take a rock- 
el scientist lo figure out dial die rea- 
son research groups are studying 
homosexuality is because we would 
like to belter understand why a per- 
son is that way. It is natural human 
nature to try to figure out things thai 
we do not understand. With a belter 
understanding of homosexualily wdl 
come more acceptance. This is 
exactly the reason why homosexuals 
are so willing to answer questions 
and be part of study groups. 

I don't know where you took your 
psychology class, but there is noi a 
single psychology class at IPFW 
that teaches that homosexuality is a 
mental disorder. The American 
Psychiatric Association's 

"Diagnostic and Statistical Manuai- 
DSM-Iir has not listed homosexu- 
ality since 1973. 

Mr. Wdlson. for a person dial lives 
so closely by die Bible you sure are 
a hypocrite. The Bible never says to 
wish death upon anodier person for 
any reason. Christ will forgive no 
matter what "sin" you have commit- 
ted. Mr. Wdlson don't tell me you 
one of ihose fools that believes 
AIDS was crcaurd by God to kill off 
all homosexuals. I'm sure you are 



well aware of the fact that homosex- 
uals are not the only individuals on 
the planet stricken with Uiis disease. 
In fact, although homosexuals do 
make up the largest group of indi- 
viduals with the AIDS virus, dicy 
are not the group that die virus is 
spreading most quickly in. The 
number of new cases reported for 
homosexuals has leveled off. while 
the group dial has shown an alarm- 
ing increase is women living in 
povcrly. The single most affected 
group of women is black women. 

Mr. WiLson homosexuality is not 
againsi die law. The only law it is 
against is yours. Fortunately for the 
resi of society no one has to live by 
your "laws" but you. Murder on the 
other hand is againsi the law. 
Categorizing murderers and homo- 
sexuals together is ludicrous. Sex 
between two consenting adults is no 
one else's business, and unlike mur- 
der, harms no one else. 

Mr, Willson, I feel sorry for you. 
You Inily sound like a sick individ- 
ual. Having that much haired in 
your heart can't possibly be healdiy. 
I agree with staff writer Tim 
Schreiber and ask the same ques- 
tion, "Why are you so direaiencd by 
homosexuals?" Suaighi men thai 
are threatened by homosexual men 
arc not comfortable widi their own 
sexuality. They try to deal with 
their uncomfortable feelings by 
directing the attention toward others. 
An example is every lime this 
uncomfortable individual sees some- 
one that they think is homosexual 
they make a big deal and point this 
person out to everyone instead of 
just minding their own business. 
The term for this behavior is reac- 
tion formation and is listed in psy- 
chology text books unlike homosex- 
uality. 

Mr, Willson, the last thing I have 
to say is dial beliefs like yours are 
dcAniicly in the minority. Not giv- 
ing homosexuals equal rights will 
not solve anything, just as it did not 
solve anydiing when America tried 
to deny blacks their rights.

Homosexuality 

not considered 

'mental disorder' 

To the Editor; 

As faculty in die department of 
psychology sciences, we feel diat it 
is imponaiu to address a number of 
inaccurate statements made by Greg 
Willson in his Oct. 22 editorial " 
The Communicator. We are aware 
dial professor Jeffrey Wilson has 
already provided rebuttal to Mr. 
Willson's colutnn. However, wc 
wish lo add some further objections. 

Wc strongly reject many of die 
premises and conclusions advanced 
in Mr. Willson's column arguing 
that homosexuality is "wrong, '' 
"abnormal," and "unnatural.' 
Cunrcntiy, science has not yet iden- 
tified all of the factors deiemiining 
heterosexual, homosexual, or bisex- 
ual development, but dicre is evi- 
dence of biological influence on 
sexual orientation. Mr. Willson's 
statement that there is no physiolog- 
ical link to homosexuality is incor- 
rect, and hence carmoi be used lo 
justify the claim dial homosexualily 
is unnatural. 

Our major concern wilh Mr. 
Willson's column focuses on his 
discussion of psychology, and the 
information he claims to have 
gained from his psychology class. 
In response we offer Uie following 
iwo points: 

Firsl, if Mr. Willson had taken an 
introductory class in our depart- 
ment, he would have been infomicd 
that psychology is the scientific 
study of behavior. Most of that 
shidy is of normal behavior. Only 
some psychologists devote their 
research or dieir leaching lo behav- 
ior defined as "abnormal." In addi- 
tion, it isn't always clear, even to 
those psychologists who do focus 
on "abnormality," what an appropri- 
ate definition of abnormal might be 



Letter 
Of The Week 



Second, Mr. Willson suies diai, in 
his psychology class, "homosexuali- 
ty was considered a mental disorder 
when we discussed it." Wc do not 
believe dial discussion took place in 
a psychology class at IPFW, In fact, 
it would be a violation of the 
Ethical Principles of Psychologists; 
and Code of Conduct (American 
Psychological Associ-ation, 1992) 
for a psychology professor to sug- 
gest that such a statement has been 
supported by research. The 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
the American Psychiatric 
Association does not include homo- 
sexuality as a disorder, and has not 
done so since 1974, It does include 
a disorder involving "persistent and 
marked distress about one's sexual 
orientation." In odier words, the 
psychiatric and psychological com- 
munities consider the inability to 
accept one's homosexuality as a 
disorder, but not homosexuality 
itself. 

FurUiemiore, Mr. Willson's point 
regarding die "obviousness" of the 
human body being designed for bei- 
erosexualiiy is not so obvious lo us. 
For example, research has shown 
that heterosexual intercourse is a 
relatively ineffcciive method of sex- 
ual stimulation for women, 
Masturbation and oral and manual 
stimulation of the clitoris are usual- 
ly more effective. These activities

of men's and women's bodies, 
and provide cffeclive sexual 
stimulanon 10 iheir panners. 

Mr. Willson stales ihai "homo- 
sexuality goes againsl the laws, 
period." Like many of his other 
statements, this one is false. 
Homosexuality is not illegal in 
the United Stales. Certain sexual 
behaviors, such as oral-genital 
sex. are illegal in about half the 
states. Even if the couple doing 
it arc husband and wife, it is still 
illegal in these states. In the 
other half of the states, including 
Indiana, consenting sexual 
behavior, whether between two 
men. a man and a woman, or two 
women, is not a crime. 

Mr. Willson's final siaicmcnl 
concerning his hope that homo- 
sexuals will move to California, 
contract AIDS and "Iteel over" is 
perhaps his most reprehensible. 
History is clear in its lessons of 
what happens when we identify a 
group as somehow "deviani," or 
worse yei, a danger lo the wider 
population. Millions of humans 
have been systematically mur- 
dered based on a characteristic 
that some fell was undesirable 
(race, religion, ethnic origin, for 
example). We believe that each 
human being should be ueated 
with dignity, regardless of their 
race, religion, ethnic origin, or 
sexual preference. To do other- 
wise establishes the social cli- 
mate that could eventually lead 
lo the destruction of human life 
on a large scale. The vitriolic 
altitudes expressed by Mr. Will- 
son certainly contribute to such a 
climate. 

Lastly, chances arc that Mr. 
Willson has unknowingly inter- 
acted with homosexuals who 
may have been his teachers. 
friends, family members or cler- 
gy. Not knowing that they were 
homosexual, Mr. Willson 
undoubtedly treated these people 
with respect. If Mr. Willson's 
attitudes were to be adopted 
widely, those people may be 
placed at the head of the line for 
elimination.

Psychologists study all behavior, not just abnormal 



To the Editor: 

Greg Willson (please note the iwo 
"l"s, no rclauon) has wriitcn an edi- 
torial condemning homosexuality 
that is so Tilled with errors thai it 
demands a response. Regarding his 
"biological design" argument, the 
human body was not "designed" for 
masturbation, oral sex. anal sex. or 
for thai matter for kissing (noses 
tend 10 get in the way) and yet het- 
erosexuals engage in all of these 
behaviors. If the body was 
"designed" expressly for vaginal 
intercourse then a design error 
occurred, for the cliloris is cicariy 
not in the optimal location. The 
physical arrangement of bodily 
pans has liltle to do with how peo- 



ple express love or derive sexual 

pleasure. 

"Physiologically" speaking, there 
have been lots of studies on hor- 
monal involvement in sexuality and 
sexual preference. Current data 
suggest that prenatal hormonal 
exposure might well determine 
adult sexual orientation by deter- 
mining brain structure, just as pre- 
natal hormonal exposure determines 
external sexual anatomy and the 
anatomy of the internal reproductive 
organs. If one chooses to condemn 
homosexuality because its cause is 
not known, then one must also con- 
demn hcterosexuality. for science 
knows just as liltle about its cause. 

Homosexuality is not considered a 



mental disorder. It has not been 
classified as such since the early 
1970's. Unless Mr, Willson's psy- 
chology class was taken a very long 
time ago, 1 doubt he was told that it 



"// the body was designed 
expressly for heterosexual 
vaginal intercourse then a 
design error occurred." 
-W. Jeffrey Wilson 

is a mental disorder. Funhcrmorc, 
if Mr. Willson classifies a behavior 
as abnormal simply because psy- 
chologists are interested in it. then 



learning, perception, memory, and 
social interaction (to name a few) 
must all be considered abnormal as 
well. Psychology is concerned with 
all behavior, and most of its subject 
matter is "nomial" behavior. 

"Religiously" speaking, well, he's 
got me iherc. Mr. Willson's interpre- 
tation of his religion apparently 
docs condemn homosexuality. Not 
all religions do so, however, and 
available data suggcsu that most 
cultures, present and historical, have 
condoned some forms of homosexu- 
al behavior. 

The statement that most homosex- 
uals are in California is wrong. Per- 
haps homosexuals in California 
have found a political voice, but 



homosexuality is present in every 
locale, among every human sociciy. 
Available data suggests that 2% to 
10% of all people are homosexual, 
even in Indiana. 

Finally, to believe thai AIDS is a 
disease that is linked to homosexu- 
ality in any way except through a 
historical accident is to be incredi- 
bly naive and foolish. AIDS is a 
disease that can affect any sexually 
active person. It is caused by a 
virus that knows nothing of morali- 
ty. To feci safe because of an exclu- 
sively heterosexual preference is 
delusional and dangerous. 

W. Jeffrey Wilson

Free love started AIDS epidemic 



To the Editor: 

1 am responding to Mr. Mark Sny- 
der's letter printed in the Oct. 22 
issue of The Communicator. Mr. 
Snyder's letter was written on a 
superior Icaer. He used words such 
as "clandestine," "bacchanaha." and 
"dilettantism." This leuer should be 
printed in a professional joumal of 
some type, but it appears, instead, in 
a college newspaper. 

However, the point of my letter is 
not that Mr, Snyder's writing is 
inappropriate for a newspaper. The 
point of my letter is something 
entirely diffetenL 

Mr. Snyder states, in his long- 
winded way, thai he believes that a 
monogamous relationship with one 
person is one that is inferior to a 
polygamous or promiscuous rela- 
tionship. He slates that his genera- 
tion thought up this idea. For my 
generation, the one in which our 
teenage years were lived in die 80's 
and 90's. I would like to express my 



sorrow to you. I am sorry that you 
bnoughi our worid such a casual look 
at life and threw religion and faith 
out the door. I am sorry that your 
generation started the epidemic of 
uncontrollable STD's and AIDS, 1 
am sorry that I now have to worry 
about having a transfusion of blood 
because I can longer be sure 1 will 
not end up with HIV positive blood. 

You see, Mr. Snyder, your genera- 
lion taught the present generation 
that sex with more than one person 
is okay. But how can that be when 
there arc so many diseases that you 
can catch by being promiscuous. 
even if you are practicing so called 
"safe sex" methods. 

1 believe. Mr. Snyder, that our 
nation needs lo begin teaching its 
children and teenagers about the 
joys that abstinence can bring to 
their lives. I hope that my genera- 
lion can learn from your genera- 
tion's mistakes and try to reverse 
ihem. Maybe then, our children will

Third party deserves recognition 




By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 
Seeking freedom of choice in ihc 
boardroom and die bedroom. Ala.s- 
ka's Andre Marrou faces many 
obstacles in his bid to become the 
hextprcsidcni of the United Slates, 
according to Nick Dunbar, the 
national direcior of die Libertarian 
party. 

' Dunbar says 
hiS party's can- 
didate 

was snubbed by 
the commission 
on presidential 
debates, Mar- 
rou was one of 

'Four candidates 

-bn the presi- 
dential ballot of 

'all 50 slates. 
Unfortunately 

'"^ "",'-"'"■ The Libertarian 

tanans, Marrou _ 

was [he only "arty 

.one of the four not selected to par- 
;ticipate in the nationally televised 
;debaics. 

- "Being on the ballot in all 50 
'S.talcs was the only objective criteri- 
Ion for selection by Ihc commis- 
sion," said Dunbar, "The other criie- 
^a were all subjective in nature. 
That was how we were left off. 
We're the third largest party in 
America. It's a nationwide party. 
They know we're here." 

Janet Brown, Executive Director 
of the debate commission, was con- 
tacted by the Communicator, but 
refused to comment on the rejection 
of Marrou's bid to parlicipalc in die 
■"debates. 

Marrou's problems don't end 
;-jhcre, according to Indiana Libertar- 
-\ian Pany director Barbara Bourland. 
»1 "We don't show up in the polls 
. tecause we aren't even a pan of die 
^-questions asked," said Boiuland, "In 
tja national student survey that 
-^eluded the Marrou/Lord ticket we 
I ^01 1 1 percent of the vote." 
, ," According lo Bourland, the News 
• lEIection Service, an independent 
f^jagency thai collects .vote totals and 
■'jdistribui&amp;sthemioihe media refuses 
pto count and report votes for Liber- 
'tarian candidates. 

,r; "Their system does not allow for 
,— the counting of our votes." said 
'Bourland. "We could take a signifi- 
■*cant portion of the votes and not be 
listed in their totals." 



Marrou's appearance on CNN's 
"Lany King Live" generated greater 
interest in the party, despite the 
polling difficulties the Libertarians 
face, according to Bourland. 

Dr. Nancy Lord is Manou's run- 
ning mate on die ticket. Lord ran for 
Mayor of the District of Columbia 
in 1990. 

Marrou is a former state represen- 
tative from Alaska and was the Lib- 
ertarian's vicc-presidentJaJ nominee 
in 1988, 

Bourland is optimistic about the 
Libcnarian party's future, despite its 
20 years of problems spreading its 
message. 

"If everyone voted their con- 
science Marrou and Lord would win 
next Tuesday," said Bourland, 
"Eventually we'll win the White 
House." 

The Marrou/Lord ticket is 
joined on the Indiana ballot by 
Steve Dillon, a candidate for the 
U.S. Senate seal currently held by 
Dan Coats. 

Despite an extensive statewide 
effort. Dillon's campaign has lan- 



guished in obscurity, drawing little 
attention in the Indiana media. 

The parly's Libertarian Party Pro- 
gram, Marrou's platform passed on 
Aug. 23. said ihc pany's main goal 
is to allow personal determinism in 
the lives of the American people, 
through vast reductions in govern- 
mental influence at all levels, 

"The Democrats will let you 
have freedom in your personal life, 
but take away your economic deci- 
sion making options," said Scott 
McKenney, a staff member in the 
party's New York office, "The 
Republicans will let you do what 
you want in die boardroom but want 
to control you in die bedroom," 

The platform, which is pro-choice 
on abortion, advocates the legaliia- 
tion of drugs to stem the tide of drug 
related crime and the elimination of 
many domestic support programs. 

The platfonn is also highly critical 
of the cunent state of the healdi care 
system and advocates removing the 
government from health care 
entirely.

Book store holds mock election 
Bush nips Perot in campus vote 



Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

Geoi^e Bush won the election. At 
least that's how students voted at 
Folleii's mock election last week. 

One hundred eighty five students 
voted in [he mock election. Bush 
got 75 votes, Peiot pulled in 60. and 
Clinton lagged behind with only SO. 

However, Ron Wyckoff, manager 
of Folleti's bookstore, said IPFW's 
results were not representative of 
their other stores. 

Follcifs first mock election was 
the largest collegiate poll ever, and 
over 400 FoUell stores participaied. 

Wyckoff said over 40,000 students 
nationwide participated in the mock 
election, which was pari of their 
"Smanen Up and Vole" campaign. 

The national presidential winner. 



according to Folleit's, was Clinton 
wiih 20.293 votes. Bush placed sec- 
ond with 11,887 and Perot got just 
8.518 votes.

being "a different sector of the coun- 
try. Ii has a lot to do with lifestyle 
and differences in concerns. Income 
and age certainly have a lot to do 
with it." 

Besides electing a candidate stu- 
dents were asked to rank the top two 
issues out of 10 possibilities. 



Issues listed were: crime, the 

environment, education, health care. 
family values, women's values, the 
economy, the candidates' chaiactcr. 
the national deficit, and televised 
debates. 

Both local and nationwide results 
said education and the economy 
were the two main issues for this 
election. 

Wyckoff said he was not surprised 
the number one concern was educa- 
tion since the polls were open only 
to students. 

Of those who voted 84 percent 
were registered voters. Wyckoff 
said die numtrer of registered voters 
was high. 

"This is a good indication of how 
college students will vote in Novem- 
ber," said Wyckoff.

Irish literature professor continues to learn from students 



By Mary Shrock 
Features Editor 

Mary Helen Thuente, associate 
professor of Irish literature, was 
recently appointed president of the 
American Conference for Irish 
Studies, 

Thuente said the American 
Conference 
is the 

largest 
scholarly 
conference 
in the 

world. 

"We have 
1600 mem- 
bers now. 
Primarily. 
we're con- 
cerned with 
cultural 
activities," said TTiuenie. 

Over 500 people, including 
Ireland's president, Maiy Robinson, 
attended the most recent meeting of 
lhe American Conference held in 
Ireland. 

"Ireland is so central to our cus- 
toms and beliefs and Mary 
Robinson is so wonderful, she 
opened up the conference," 
Tliucnic. 




In addition to being president of 
lhe American conference. Thuenlc 
has also become director of IPFW's 
Masters of Liberal Arts program. 

Thuenlc received her bachelor's 
degree ai Clarke college in Iowa in 
English. 

It was later in graduate school at 
lhe University of Kansas that 
Thuente began to research Irish lit- 
erature and history. 

"I actually did my dissenation on 
Ydats and Irish folklore, ihen 1 con- 
tinued research on thai topic for my 
Ph.D. program," Thuente said, " At 
the time, in lhe '70's my theories 
were very new. Now it's standard in 
Irish swdics classes to look at Yeats 
in relation to folklore." 

lt"s only fitting after so much 
research on William Butler Yeats 
thai Thuente 's first book was about 
Yeats. 

"William Butler Yeats and Irish 
Folklore," was the name of 
Thuentc's book published in 1980. 



Her newest book, "Uniied 
Inshmcn and the Development of 
Irish Literary Nationalism," is due 
oul in the next year. 

Thuente has also been published 
in scholarly Journals in Canada, 
England. America and Ireland. 

Thuente grew up in Chicago. She, 
herself, comes from an Irish- 
American heritage. 

She came to IPFW as a pan-lime 
instuctor with her husband. David, 
who is a professor of mathematics 
and computer science, 17 years ago. 

The Thuente's have iwo sons, 
Dan, who attends Notre Dame, and 
Michael Patrick, a fifth grader. 

Dan is also a member of Notre 
Dame's efite Irish Guard. 

Thucnie said she primarily thinks 
of herself as a teacher But she is 
also very devoted to her family. 

"I will always continue lo learn in 
my leaching. Students are conslanl- 
ly developing and changing my per- 
specbve on things," Thuente s^d.

Local spiritualist guides community 



By Mary Sbrock 
Features Editor 

Modem day witches exist. They 
could be living next door to any of 
us. They could be students al IPFW 
or teachers. They could even be a 
Zamboni driver. 

John Schnieders, manager of the 
Crystal Cove a store specializing in 
the metaphysical, said witches regu- 
larly shop at his store. 

"A wilch is really just a person 
thai has a knowledge of the natural 
energies on earth that benefit 
mankind. It's not black magic." 
Schnieders said. 

Schnieders said metaphysics is not 
considered New Age. 

"There's nothing new about New 
Age. It's just a bunch of things 
coming together from all differenl 
religions," he said. 

According lo Schnieders meta- 
physics is a philosophy based on the 
concept all people are one. Each 
person affects others around him 
and everything we do, all actions 
people take, come back in some 
way. 



"It's not religion. It's spirituality. 
Metaphysics realizes the creator is 
within each of us. He's not on the 
outside looking in. He's right here 
guiding us," Schnieders said, 

'Tarot cards are the tools for help- 
ing people listen to their own 
insights," Schnieders said, "It's 
putting the answer to the question in 
front of your face." 

But Schnieders pointed out not 
everyone can be a Tanat card reader. 

"Anyone can deal Tarot cards, and 
lay ihem out, but being a inie spiri- 
tual guide lakes a person who can 
tune into their intuitions. You've 
gotta have either the potential for 
learning the skills or be bom with 
the ability," Schnieders said. 

Charlotte Hetrick does three Ibnt 
card readings a day at the Crystal 
Cove. 

Hetrick said she doesn't want to be 
considered a psychic. 

"I don't like lo do predictions or 
fortune telling, I believe we are all 
psychic. We are all guided by ener- 
gy, we can all feel it and use it," 
Hetrick said
