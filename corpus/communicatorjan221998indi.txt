Financial aid still available 



Bv Oodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



aside from registering for 
classes, paying for one's col- 
lege tuition can be a source 
of great confusion That is 
why the Financial Aid Office 
at IPFW can be of some 
assistance lo many. 

According lo Ruben Garcia, 
associate director of Financial Aid, 
about 49 percent of all students on 
campus receive financial aid. 

The number could be higher. 
but there are some who are under 
the impression that they do not qual- 
ify for any financial aid and others 
who are daunted by the idea of the 
paperwork involved in the applica- 
tion process. 

Many are under the impression 
that financial aid planning need be 
done wbile one is still in high school 
or it is loo late. 

No one wanLs to be stuck pay- 
ing back loans with astronomical 
interest, but loans arc not the only 
form of financial aid available to 
most students. 

In addition lo loans, financial 
aid comes in different forms: schol- 
arships, grants and subsequent sub- 
divisions. 

Wben the application process 
begins for financial aid, a student is 
issued a generic Financial Aid Form 
fFAF) 

"The Financial Aid Form is 
used strictly for providing informa- 
tion about the student to the [United 
Slates] Department of Education," 
said Garcia. 

Robert Zellers. director of 
Financial Aid, hopes those in need 
of more information will attend one 
of two financial aid nights on cam- 
pus. 

The sessions will be held Feb 
9 and 16 at 6:30 p.m.. in the Walb 



Ballroom 

At the financial aid information 
sessions, applicants are taken step 
by step through filling out the finan- 
cial aid forms. 

h is helpful for applicants to 
have their tax forms with them 

While nearly half of the campus 
is in need of financial aid, atten- 
dance at the sessions is sparse 

Garcia notes that at the finan- 
cial aid presentations he has hosted 



Ebout 49 per- 
cent of all stu- 
dents on cam- 
pus receive financial 
aid. The number 
could be higher, but 
there are some who 
are under the 
impression that they 
do not qualify for 
any financial aid, 
and others who are 
daunted by the idea 
of the paperwork 
involved in the appli- 
cation process. 



recently there were only ten people 
in attendance. 

"CThe attendance) is not as good 
as I would like for it to be," said 
Garcia. 

Besides their tax forms, it is not 
necessary for those wishing to 
attend to bring anything else; the 



forms are provided at the presenta- 
tions 

It is unknown how many stu- 
dents' aid has been processed slow- 
ly due to incorrect completion of the 
form. 

The financial aid form is used to 
create a student profile as far as 
family contribution and what indi- 
viduals or their families are able to 
use to supplement any aid that is 
awarded. 

The university then determines 
how much aid students will receive, 
based on the findings provided by 
the Department of Education. 

The Department of Education, 
in turn, determines if one is eligible 
for loans, grants, or work-study, or 
in some cases, a combination of all 

The Department of Education 
findings are sent 10 applicants in the 
form of a student aid report, which 
is an acknowledgment of the FAJF 

The financial aid presentations 
which are to be held in February 
will be have different presenters 
The Feb. 9 session will be conduct- 
ed by Vickie Dahl, the assistant 
director of Financial Aid, and the 
Feb 16 presentation by Garcia. 

The presentations will include 
an overview of what is available in 
financial aid. "The whole purpose is 
to assist students in filling out the 
form and meeting IPFW's dead- 
line." said Garcia. 

Incidentally, (he people most 
likely to benefit from the newly 
passed Taxpayer Relief Act are 
those with HOPE scholarships or 
those receiving aid under Tide IV 
from the Department of Education 

The Act will allow those who 
qualify to use their scholarship 
award as earned income tax credit.

Looking for a job? Look no fur- 
ther. IPFW possesses two new 
JobView terminals to help you in 
your search. 

JofcView is an ATM-style 
machine that gives touch-screen 
access to descriptions of thousands 
of local jobs. 

These jobs are from among 
those listed previously in the classi- 
fieds from The Journal Gazette and 
The New-Sentinel. 

Those seeking employment can 
visit one of the two free JobView 
kiosks on campus and search 
through the listed job opportunities. 



Job descriptions can be searched 
by category and printed. 
Applications can even be directly 
submitted for some jobs at the termi- 
nal. 

The service includes ads not in 
the locaJ Sunday newspapers. IPFW 
JobLinc jobs, and a sampling of the 
jobs offered through career service.

Dhe start of a new semester 
often gives students the 
feeling of starting over: 
new classes, new profes- 
sors, new theories, etc. 
Unfortunately, sometimes 
things do not change from one 
semester to the next. 

One of those things is the seem- 
ingly perpetual construction of the 
second parking garage which is 
located near (he Gates Sports 
Center. 

According lo Lieutenant Tom 
Haner of Police and Safety, the 
structure should be completed 



sometime in April. 

That knowledge will allow 
many to breathe a sigh of relief. 

The construction of the fall 
semester brought with it much 
unpleasantness. 

There were extraordinary 
amounts of mud on the walkway 
between the Gates parking lot and 
Walb Union. 

Trucks often blocked the road if 
one had the misfortune of attempt- 
ing lo make a right turn out of the 
Gates Center parking lot. 

The boisterous voices of con- 
struction workers added to the mud 
and traffic problems. 

In return for enduring such con- 
ditions, the users of the IPFW cam- 
pus are rewarded with a brand new 
parking garage that will bouse 950 
spaces to accommodate A, B, hand- 
icapped and metered parking. 



Even though the semester will 
be nearly over by the time the 
garage is ready for use, the sooner 
the building is complete, the sooner 
the faculty and students will be able 
to enjoy it. 

The cost of this luxury is sever- 
al million dollars. 

Most users of the north side of 
campus will agree this is a small 
price to pay in order to decrease the 
stress caused by wailing for a park- 
ing place, being late to class or hav- 
ing to park much farther away from 
the building one needs to access. 

The purpose of the garage, as 
far as the university is concerned, is 
"lo get more parking on the north 
side of the campus for the expan- 
sion area and for the existing build- 
ings." said Haner.

Jones u. Clinton 



Unless you don'i have a televi- 
sion, don'i read Ihe newspaper and 
basically, have no connection lo ihe 
outside world you know about (he 
Ms. Paula Jones v. Prcsidenl Clinton 
case. 

Well, we aren't too sure Ms 
Jones has enough evidence or credi- 
biJity to persuade us into thinking 
that President Clinton sexually 
harassed her in a hotel room back 
when he was still governor of 
Arkanas. 

Now. all the women that just 
jumped out their chairs exclaiming, 
"Sexisl!" take a seat and hear us out. 

We find that Ms. Jones has some 
questionable areas to her story. First 
and foremost, what did she think his 
intentions were when, and if. he 
asked her up to his hotel room? M ilk 
and cookies with conversation about 
hide Chelsea, we think not. 

Any woman of the '90's knows 
the rule about going up to stranger's 
hotel room, ihey don'L True. Bill 
Clinton was ^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

governor and 

was "known" to 
the public, but

ing him well | F SHE WERE TRULY CON-

ence. 

Ms. Jones was also given anoth- 
er chance lo make her claim when 
Gennifcr Flowers came forward 
with accusations of an affair with the 
now President Clinton, who denied 
il. 

Imagine the front those women 
could have formed if ihey had 
banned together. But no. Ms. Jones 
continued to remain silent. It's only 
been in the last several years or so 
that we have heard about her alleged 
conflict with the Preside nL 

And as far as these other 
women, who have been found by 
attorneys for Ms Jones, and who say 
ihey have experienced some of the 
same unwanted advances from the 
Prcsidenl. ..PLEASE. How bard 
would it be to dig up a few women 
dial knew the President? Or some 
that are willing to lie about it for 
some personal gain? 

We believe that what folks do in 
the privacy of their bedrooms is no 
^^^^^^^^^m one's business 
but theirs We 
don't need to 
know who slept 
with whom five 
years ago 

Unless it 
wasn't consen-

change every- 
thing We are in 
no way stating 
that il would be 
okay for a per- 
son to forcibly 
have sex with

Another 
aspect of her 
story that does- ' • • 
n't jive with us is the time period 
which she waited to make these alle- 
gations. 

If she were truly concerned 
about her reputation and appalled by 
the actions of ihe governor, she 
would have been yelbng, "Sexual

The 

problem is that no one wdl ever

The only ones that know die

We simply believe lhat if il was

We feel this hints towards Ms.

To THE editor: 

What holds femaJe students at 
IPFW back from joining a sorority? 
Many students are not willing to 
join a sorority because ihey are 
unaware of die activities sororily 
members at IPFW are involved in 
and they often tend to stereotype the 
girls thai are in them. This occurs 
because people believe sorority 
behavior is modeled like that depict- 
ed in such movies as "Animal 
House " Television has developed a 
very biased view of sororiiies caus- 
ing its viewers to stereotype mem- 
bers who belong to a sorority such 
as Pi Beia Phi Many students are 
unaware of the value of joining a 
sorority and the benefits the Pi Beta 
Phi sorority offers lis members 

The Pi Beta Phi chapter is 130 
years old. which means this Greek 
Chapter is well-established. The Pi 
Beta Phi sorority has many mem- 
bers around the country. Al biannu- 
al conventions members from many 
different colleges join together for 
workshops and olher ceremonial 
events to bring together other Pi Phi 
members. Many members are rec- 
ognized within the organization for 
various reasons such as service, pro- 
gramming and scholarship, along 
with many other things. 

Numerous myths and rumors 
exist about sorority members. Many 
individuals believe only wealthy

Let it be said- 

The Communicator extends a sincere 
welcome to any and all members of the 
student body who arc interested in work- 
ing for IPFW's student newspaper. We 
arc looking for student* with diverse 
backgrounds and from all majors to par- 
ticipate in all sections of the paper. 
Experience is not necessary. Wheiher 
you are a writer, artist, photographer, or 
have an opinion about something, be 
assured that your participation will be 
appreciated and will make a difference. 



women can afford to join a soronly 
Greek life is actually quite afford- 
able. You must pay a S5 Rush fee. 
which allows the Pi Phi's to have 
rush events. Later on you will learn 
the exact cost, which can, in most 
cases, be made in monthly install- 
ments for about S20 a month 

Often sorority members may be 
looked at as under-achievers who 
have bad grades The Pi Phi chapter 
at IPFW needs a chapter grade of 
2.75. Study tables are held and 
tutoring is available to keep the 
grades of members up The 2.75 
GPA is actually higher than ihe 
campus requirements 

Others look at sororily members 
as sex maniacs The most important 
fact to point out is lhat it is an 
unwarranted assumption Pi Phi's 
have rules of how one musl behave 
in social situations These rules 
must be maintained at all limes 
because of high moral standards, 
Often umes it is believed thai soror- 
ily members do embarrassing and 
painful things as a part of hazing 
Indiana Purdue Panhellenic Council 
has a zero tolerance stand on hazing. 
Newcomers who are pledging to 
join Pi Phi sorority can join without 
fear and intimidation. 

The benefits of joining the Pi 
Phi organization arc endless. Just 
some of the advantages include 
social experiences such as formats, 
teamwork skills, leadership skills 
and friendships By joining, self- 



esteem improves and grades, in 
mosl cases, improve as well. Not lo 
mention sisterhood which will last a 
lifetime Many more benefits exist, 
however, it is impossible lo lisl 
them all. It is important to point out 
lhat Ihe Pi Phi organization is well 
known for its high academic and 
moral standards. 

The Pi Phi organization has 
many events throughout the year. It 
has always had a tradition of service 
and education. They were the firsi to 
develop a national philanthropic 
project. Links lo Liieracy is a foun- 
dation thai the Pi Phi chapters all 
around die country support. Links lo 
Literacy is a foundation which helps 
children in the process of learning to 
read. They do this by reading to 
young children, buying books and 
recognizing and helping adults who 
are illiterate. 

Pi Phi's do many things such as 
bake sales to help raise money. 
These events enable students lo 
interact with the communiiy. They 
also do other ihings throughout the 
year such as formals. cookouts and 
sisterhood retreats. 

Becoming a member is simple. 
Any women at IPFW is eligible for 
rush if they meet university grade 
requirements, which is a 2.5 GPA 
You are suggested to attend at leasi 
rwo meetings, so ihe members will 
have a chance to meei you. The rush 
events include gelling information 
about ihe Pi Phi chapter along with 



registenng 

Many wonder if being a sorori- 
ly member has any advantages wiih 
future job opportuniiies. There are 
many justifications for adding to 
your resume lhat you were involved 
in a soronly. A prospective employ- 
er may have been a member of a 
sorority or fraternity once them- 
selves and they will instantly realize 
the abilities you possess, such as 
teamwork and leadership. Jusi at 
IPFW atone, there are nearly 30.000 
alumni Thinecn thousand of Ihem 
live and work in Allen Couniy. For 
students, this means an instant 
source for career guidance, job 
information and job referral. 

As you may now sec. joining a 
sororily has many benefits. The 
value of joining an organization 
such as Pi Beta Phi is endless and 
the stereotypes you may have had 
may no longer exist. Members are 
also involved in many other campus 
activities and arc always trying lo 
make a difference which says a 
great deal for ihis organization. As 
you can see, being a part of a soror- 
ity means more than partying on the 
weekends. It involves much more. 
Why not make the most of your col- 
lege experience and join die Pi Beta 
Phi sorority loday?

New year reaffirms faith 



Learning as I go: Lisa Zinn 



As a new year is under way, I 
challenge everyone to look inside 
themselves and see what is really 
important lo ihem. Is il the lax 
returns that you will be receiving 
laier in ihe year? Or is it the new 
relationship you staned wiih the 
boy/girl you met at ihe New Year's 
party? For some, il may be the 
degree they will be receiving at the 
end of ihe semester. 

Either way, it is greai to have 
things important to you; however, il 
is necessary to decide what is mosl 
important to you Whai is the one 
thing thai you would never be able 
to be truly happy without? 

For mc. il is my relationship 
with God Whenever I am thrown a 
disappointment (or 10!) 1 often sit 
back and ask Him to help me under- 
stand it. 

People often say I am a disgust- 
ingly happy person. Yes. overall I do 
not have much to complain about 
and 1 figure I am only as happy as I 
choose to be. Sure, I have moods as 
anyone else docs, but in the end, it 
comes right down lo perspective. 

We all have something to learn 
from all things. Granted, lhat does 



not mean everything in life should 
be psychoanalyzed. Sometimes you 
jusi have to enjoy them. 

Jesus Christ has given me many 
opportunities to grasp hold of and 
delight in. For these, I am truly 
thankful. 1 have also been thrown 
some real curves throughout my life 
lhat have caused my relationship 
with Him to be strained al times 
Overall, what I thought weakened 
my relationship, strengthened tl. 
One way or anoiher. He always 
helps me figure il out 

Luckily, I have a best friend in 
Him lhat will never lei me down II 
is very easy for me to think of the 
times thai He bas saved my sanity 
and pulled me out of some real dis- 
appointments Bui. whal aboul ihe 
times when everything seemed to be 
going jusi fine? Have I always 
praised Him for His blessings? Do I. 
in all lhat I do. show others that I 
truly love my Savior? 

Honestly? No. Not because of a 
lack of caring. Simply because of 
basic human sin. 

I recently ihougbl about my life. 
Even though I can't visually see all 
thai He offers, do I stdl believe in 



'.: -■ 

Him? Even Ihough I hear His Word 
wiih my cars, do I really trust in 
Him? 

Just because I canno! see God in 
human form, lhat docs not mean I do 
not believe thai He exists I see Him 
in the world around me. My belief is 
based on failh 

Listening lo God's Word is noi 
merely using our ears, but our 
([■. hi- Someumes it can be easy to 
listen to Him wiih our ears, bui 
using our beans allows us lo trust in 
Him and make our failh even 
stronger 

Too many limes, we only come 
to God asking for Hun to fix the big 
and Little things in our lives. It is 
good lo come to Him in times of 
need, but whai about the times of 
joy and celebration? God wants our 
prayers as well as our praises. And 
surely. He deserves praises. 

Whai is important most in my 
life? How much do I love God? 
Moreso. how much does He love 
me? Closing my eyes, imagining 
His outstretched hands showing nail 
piercing, I can do nothing else but 
bow to Him and truly thank Him for 
His Grace.

Your Turn: Amu Austin 



In high school, I played soccer 
for Northrop's girls leam. I started 
playing during my sophomore year 
and was no! very good at Ihc begin- 
ning I warned more than anything 
lo improve and build my skills, so I 
could possibly play in college 

Well, I did get better My skills 
grew each year. Last year, when I 
was a senior, I started varsity in 
goal. I was named most improved 
player my junior year and leitered 
in both my junior and senior years. 
I found a passion for the game and 
I still have it. 

My one chance of playing was 
here at IPFW My high school 
coach kept telling our senior class 
that IPFW would probably have a 
women s team this year. 

That was my window, my one 
opportune chance We did not get a 
team this year and now I am stuck 
here only going to class. No soccer 
I am going 10 play indoor soc- 
cer this winier. I am hoping that 
IPFW will have a women's team to 
play for next year, 

Title IX the Educational 
Amendments of 1972 stales that 
"Colleges receiving federal funds 
must offer the underre presented 
sex [fot the most part, women] 
equal opportunity in athletic pro- 
grams to the majority sex." In other 
words, colleges that are federally 
funded, must offer the same athlet- 
ic programs to both men and 
women. 

Title IX requires schools lo 
meet one of three requirements 
One, "Match the proportion or men 
and women in the school's total 
enrollment with the proportion to 
men and women participating in 
athletics" 

Two, "Show a continuing his- 
tory of expansion and good faith 
effort to improve the participation 
of the underrepresented sex." 

Three. "Demonstrate that it 
fully and effectively accommo- 
dates the . interests and abilities of 
the underrepresented sex." 

Under these three guidelines. 1 
feel that IPFW should form a 
women's soccer team. I know for a 
fact, that there are several women 
at IPFW who feel the same way. I 
know this because I used to play 
with and against several girls who 
went here after they graduated 
from high school. 

Womens soccer has been the 
largest growing sport to come out 
of Title IX "Between 1991 and 
1995, the amount of Division II 
schools offering womens soccer 
has increased from 60 (o 120, a 210 
percent increase." according lo the 
January 1996 issue of "Soccer 
Digest" 

This means that the compeii- 
lion is out there wailing for IPFW 
lo gel a team and dominate 

I have had the opportunity to 
talk lo several high school girls 
coaches this past high school sea- 
son. Coaches from Nonhrop, 
Snider, Bishop Dwenger and South 
Side ihink that IPFW should have 
had a team a long time ago, 

Many high school players 



want to play for IPFW if they had 
the chance. I know several girls 
who played in high school and go 
here now who would love to have 
the chance lo represent IPFW on 
the soccer field In addition, (here 
are girls who are graduating this 
year from their respected high 
schools who bave a lot of talent. 
who are planning on attending 
IPFW in the fall 

Obviously IPFW won't be a 
North Carolina or a Notre Dame 
their first couple seasons. However, 
if they do get a team and begin 
building the talent and potential is 
right here in Fort Wayne lo become 
a Division II power house some- 
day. 

I'm sure thai the expense is not 
the reason that we do not have a 
team yet. It has to be one of the 
least expensive sports lo gel started 
It's kind of like a field of dreams to 
many of us who play soccer that 
attend classes here. If (hey build it. 

On behalf of those who still 
play soccer afier high school, we 
want a team 

I realize lhat there are some 
people oui there that don'l ihink 
that girls should be playing soccer. 
My mom is one of ihem. 

Those people ihink thai it's loo 
rough of a sport for girls That there 
is too great of a chance of being 
injured. There is a risk of being 
hurt at any sport. Granted thai soc- 
cer may be slightly more physical. 
People nave lo remember that girls 
can be just as physical as guys are. 

It's more of a choice as to 
whether a sport becomes physical 
or not. Even being laken down 
becomes a way of life lo some soc- 
cer players. It just comes with the 
territory We. both men and 
women, understand the risks of the 
game. People play their sport for 
the love, not for ihe risk. 

In closing, I want to reiterate 
my request that IPFW organizes a 
women's soccer program next fall. 
It is a federally funded college and 
must offer the same aihlciic oppor- 
tunities to boih men and women 

I am not sure if it is illegal thai 
we don'l have a women's team, but 
in my mind we should, if for noth- 
ing else lhan for the interest of the 
women soccer players attending 
this university. 

I know lhat gelling a leam is 
under consideration. I only hope 
lhal ibe athletic director and 
Chancellor decide lo send the 
women to play soccer in 1998.

What's weak this week: Dennis Donahue 



Hey kids, what are you doing 
on Sunday? Oh yeah, it's the Super 
Bowl, or should I say the NFC 
Bowl Let the rout begin. You know. 
1 get sick of the same learns win- 
ning every year, don'l you? Even 
diehard fans have to admit that this 
has become the Redundant Bowl If 
you believe the hype about this 
game, you must have a shallow 
existence. Green Bay fans, ihe real 
ones, have got lo be fired up about 
their chances for a fourth title 
Sorry Denver, at least you have 
South Park. 

There have been 31 Super 
Bowls and like, three winners, 
right? I guess you can tell I'm noi a 
huge pro football fan, bul I've 
always liked the Bears, ever since I 
was little. You see, my mom is from 
Chicago and she got me hooked on 
'Da Bears' a long, long time ago I 
also like ihe Colts. (I had a VERY 
long football season) My dad 
bought season tickets when the 
leam moved here from Baltimore 
Remember that? I was still in high 
school, and we got to see the Coils 
lose a bunch of games, but we've 
always been fans. Win or lose, I still 
love the Bears and the Colts That is 
whal separates me from the band- 
wagon' fans. Real fans support their 
teams through all sons of changes, 
ask a loyal Raiders fan about that 
Look at Ihe Cubs, they've sucked 
for years, but they have millions of 
fans, like me. 

Everybody loves a winner and 
this is very true for fans in this pan 
of the state. And what's up with all 
die Steelers fans in this town' Is 
this a Woodson thing? Vaughn 
Dunbar played for Ihe Saints and 
how many of you rooted for them' 
That's what I thought. And there 
sure is a lot of Green Bay apparel 
being worn lately. And the 
Cowboy's thing? I even see Florida 
Stale and Duke jackets here in the 
Fort Whatever. 



I laugh at people that say. "I've 
always been a (recently good or last 
year's championship leam five 
stales away) fan." You know you 
haven't The last couple years sure 
have produced a lot of Cleveland 
Indian fans You were the same 
people thai didn'l go to the games 
for the last forty years, right? Are 
you a Marlins fan this year? All the 
merchandise you wear is new, so 
don'l kid yourself You are on the 
bandwagon, and we know ii. 

The funny thing is people don't 
root for teams anymore, they root 
for players. I feel bad for all the 
sports fans who follow Deion 
Sanders. He has played for three 
football teams and three baseball 
teams in sin years How many jer- 
seys do they own? If Waller Payion 
ever left Chicago. I would have still 
been a Bears fan. A very sad one 
too. I wouldn't root for the team he 
left for. In my day. this would have 
been a sin. Today, we follow the 
players and coaches around 1 even 
caught myself pulling for Ditka one 
game this year and, of course, they 
lost. 

So let's lalk about Sunday's 
game. Actually, lei's not The media 
has been talking about it for over 
two weeks now How much is there 
to know? Football isn't that compli- 
cated 1 played for seven years. We 
had pass plays for slow defensive 
comers, pass rush plays on defense. 
sweeps, options, zones, traps and 
some trick plays loo It is a very 
simple game. You try and get the 
ball into ihe end zone. That's it. Oh 
sure, it is a little challenging but 
some teams do it well and some 
don'l. It isn't ihe pure science that 
husbands and boyfriends portray il 
lo be. Il is fun lo talk about but 
watching pro football can be bor- 
ing, especially Ihe Super Bowl 

When a guy sacks ihe quarter- 
back, he acts like a hero. This is him 
at his best, at work. I don't high five 
my bass when I meet a deadline or 
do a project that is expected of me.

And I sure as hell don't kneel and 
pray every lime I gel to work on 
lime. 

You know of course there is 
'holding' on every play Watch Ihe 
replays. Every play, a guy is hold- 
ing, defensively and offensively. So 
don't tell me someone has a great 
offensive line They just don'l get 
caught as much And tackling is 
your job. so slop celebrating so 
much. Let the fans scream for you. 

Who will win'' Probably the 
Packers, but football fans outside of 
Wis. are rooting for the Broncos 
It's the "1 feel sorry for Elway" 
thing that has swept the nation Or 
the "Denver's never won it" senti- 
ment. Thai's my approach Let 
someone else win ihe damn thing 
Besides, this is the best opportunity 
for the AFC. The NFC just keeps 
getting belter, with the exception of 
the Si. Louis Rams. 

And besides, Super Sunday is 
for being wilh friends and family 
and drinking so much thai our 
wives have lo drive home My wife 
and I have been going to the same 
parly for whal will be our fourth 
year The food and company is 
always great and we usually stop 
watching around half-lime. As a 



group, 1 Ihink more of us arc inter- 
ested in the new commercials that 
air. This is ihe best pan of the whole 
game in my opinion. This year 
we'll have a recent Packer fan ihcre 
with his girlfriend He has been lo 
Lambcau Field, (like Wrigley Field 
in status, but for football. And ihcy 
win there) so I qualify him as a 
cheese-bead. I'm sure he will have 
his Green Bay hat and sweatshirt on 
and we will try hard to make him 
feel like he's alone rooting for the 
Packers. We will give him grief, 
because he is our friend and we love 
him 

So enjoy the game this week- 
end, and ignore the hype It proba- 
bly won't be super 1 will waich the 
ads and play a little euchre I'll eai 
a Ion of food and drink some beer. 
And again, my wife will drive us 
home. As for ihe Bears and Colls? 
Well, maybe next year. By Ihc way, 
in the Bud Bowl, I've got Bud Lite 
and I'm giving 61/2 points if any- 
body wants a piece of the action. 
Since everyone has a prediction, 
here's mine: Denver upsets Ihe 
Packers 27-20. It could happen 
Plus, it would be a great game.

there is Ally's roommate Renae

built a show around this wonderful her often-uptight roomy The 

woman Can you guess the title? It woman encourages Ally to be out- 
is none other than "Ally McBeal 



Furthermore, critics have recog- 
nized her brilliance and have gra- 
ciously awarded her two Golden 
Globes So if you haven' t caught on 
to the "Ally McBeal" craze, il 
seems high time that you get on 
board. 

Airing Monday nights at 9 p.m. 
on the FOX network, the show has 
wedged past its competitors to offer 
viewers of prime time television 
something fresh and original. And I 
say it is about damn time! No it 
may not be as funny as "South 
Park," maybe not as melodramatic 
as "ER," and the courtroom battles 
probably do not throw as many 
punches as "Law &amp; Order," but as I 
said before, this show is breaking 
new ground. 

Its a refreshing hour of televi- 
sion that follows the life of a 
woman dealing with problems we 
all deal with: dealing with lost 
loves, competitiveness on the job, 
sexual harassment, sexual hor- 
mones (well, sex in general really) 
and so on. The laughs are instanta- 
neous that can result from her 
{ drinking her morning coffee, 
: sculpting a man with a large 
"piece" or fighting imaginary 
images that constantly cross her 
mind. 

Ally, portrayed perfectly by 
Calista Flockhart, is a female 
' lawyer trying to find her way in a 
; field dominated by men Each 
week, the episode follows the 
young woman through her life, in 
and out of die workplace. On the 



ragcous, danng and adventurous, 
yet sometimes ber advice can lead 
to devastating results. 

The ensemble cast is terrific 
and is far too complex to describe 
in simple terms The women take 
advantage of the men and lease 
them ruthlessly Men discuss 
important things like whether size 
really counts and everyone has a 
ball. "Ally McBcaJ" pulls all the 
strings. 

Created by David E. Kelly 
(husband of actress Michelle 
PliefeO, "Ally McBeal" warns par- 
ents before the show airs. It con- 
centrates on issues that all adults 
face. Some of ils contcnl may be 
offensive to some, but most will 
realize how truc-to-lifc it really is. 

One final highlight of the show 
is the music heard throughout it. 
Singer, songwriter Venda Shepard 
is the sole provider of the soulTul 
tunes. Attaining critical success 
from the show, the songs often shed 
a light on ihe thoughts and ideas 
that are roaming through Ally's 
head. Later this year. Shepard wilt 
be releasing a soundtrack of the 
television show, thai could be a big 
seller due to the popularity of the 
show. 

Even though I may not wear 
heels, suffer from cramps or com- 
pletely understand the thoughts 
roaming through a woman's mind, I 
somehow relate to "Ally McBeal." 
She's real intelligent and caring. 
It's a mix sure to catch the hearts of 
its viewers. Men may feel it is an 
hour of man bashing, but for me. I

Valeritine's Day expenses can 
run quite high if you do not plan 
how to spend your money wisely. 
Cash will disappear faster from 
your account than a Tiajuana prosti- 
tute with your wallet. 

Since we arc all college stu- 
dents, money has a tendency to 
be scarce and we all try save 
wherever we can. 

But when it comes 
to Valentine's Day and 
if you have a signifi 
cant other, you 
must do some- 
thing. You may 
not be able spend 
a wad of cash, 
but there are 
other ways to 
show that some- 
one special you 
care and love 
them. 

Here are a few 
that will come in 
under S5: 



you are proud to be with them 

If you want to leave an erotic 
message on your lover's machine, 
be sure you have the correct num- 
ber. You do not want to accidentally

machine telling her how much you 
would like to suck her 



get your point across to the special 
one in your life Spray some per- 
fume on the letter 

Make a tape of all the songs that 
remind you of each other 
Hopefully, you won't have to buy 
anything for this. If you do not have

Make breakfast in bed for your 
lover This really puts you in the 
mood for love Hopefully you both 
will be naked. But be careful, blue- 
berry syrup is almost impossible to

them. A single rose is just as 

romantic as a dozen.

group of men and women who hilarity. I love this woman and soon 
have, since the show began in millions of others will loo 
September, become her closest 
friends. 

First, there is Billy (Greg 
Germann), who was the college 
flame of Ally's and whom she con- 
siders to be the love of her life 
Coincidenially, there is one prob- 
lem: be is married to Georgi 
(Courtney Thome -Smith, previous- 
ly of Melrose Place), who is not 
only beautiful, but a lawyer as well. 
Things can gel pretty tight in ihe 
office between the three, yel Ally 
has found other men who catch her 
eye and has befriended her ex- 
love's spouse. 

Olher co-workers include 
Elaine (lane Krakowski). ihe nosy 
receptionist who seems to catch all 
the gossip that crawls within the 
walls of the law firm. She's cither 
got her ear attached to a closed 
office door, has climbed upon a toi- 
let in one of the bathroom stalls or 
has accidentally pressed ihe wrong 
line on the telephone system to hear 
the latest 

The boss, Richard (Peier 
MacNichol), seems almost as bad. 
The man will do anything for a 
buck; bul he's a lawyer, so what can 
you expect? Yet his one liners real- 
ly get viewers rolling with laughter 
He was once asked what he would

If your other is not in a place to 
hear it, tape it and play it back for 
them in the car. like you are listen- 
ing to the radio. 

Write a poem for them This is 
not the daunting task it seems. If it 
comes from the heart, the other will 
treasure it. If you are intimidated by 
writing a poem for someone, copy 
one and give it to ihem. The thought 
is there and your olher will know it. 

If your lover is away, call them 
and read them a bedtime story. This 
may cost a little bit on the phone 
bill, but il is not an immediate bill 
so you can put this off 

Take out a small ad in the paper. 
These cost very little and it shows 
the world that you are proud of your 
mate and are willing to tell every- 
one about your love 

Make a candlelight dinner for 
two at your home. Nothing shows 
love as much as nourishing your 
lover by making everything with 
your own hands Dress up like you 
are going out to a fancy restaurant 
it adds to the mood of the evening.

Alcoholism is a primary, pro- 
gressive, chronic disease character- 
ized by a growing compulsion lo 
drink. Scientists do not know pre- 
cisely what causes this disease, but 
research suggests thai physiological 
factors, such as heredity and 
metabolism, play an impor- 
tant role in determining who 
becomes alcoholics. 

Children of alcoholics ; 
three or four times more likely than 
others to develop this disease, but 
people with no known history of 
family alcoholism may also be at 
risk. 

Since researchers have not yet 
identified the factors which predis- 
pose 10 percent of all drinkers to 
become alcoholic, anyone who 
drinks lakes that chance. 

Alcoholism has no known cure 
and, if left unchecked, ends in death. 
Only abstinence can stop ihe dis- 
ease's progress. 

FACTS: 

Progression 

No one sets out to become 
addicted to alcohol. Many recover- 
ing alcoholics say their first drink 
filled them with profound enjoy- 
ment, as if they had found a magical 
elixir In retrospect, they can see 
that from the very beginning their 
bodies process alcohol abnormally. 

Other alcoholics remember no 
early clues. But for all alcoholics, 
whether subtle signs appear wiih the 
first drink or after many years of 
drinking, the disease progresses 
long before they exhibit obvious 



secret, altering not only their body 
chemistry, but their judgments, feel- 
ings and perspective At first, alco- 
holics seem to respond to alcohol no 
differently than Ihe majority of 
drinkers 

Such warning signs as preoccu- 
pation with alcohol and frequent 
drinking are socially acceptable and 
may fail lo cause alarm. 



become resentful and depressed 

They may also hide their bottles 
and make attempts to drink less In 
late-stage alcoholics, tolerance 
decreases. They cannot achieve the 
desired effects, no matter how much 
they dnnk Rather than get "high" 
from alcohol, they just get sick. 
Late-stage alcoholics drink in spite 
of adverse consequences. They 
experi- 
e n c e 
deep 
cravings 
for alcohol, 
:vere with- 
drawal symp- 
toms and malnu- 
trition. 

Blackouts

Idiana UnFef 



A high tolerance for 
alcohol — the ability to 
drink in great quantities 
without appearing 
drunk — is a noticeable 
early warning sign. 

As the disease pro- 
gresses, tolerance 
changes. In the middle- 
stage alcoholics, toler- 
ance increases. They 
require more alcohol to, 
achieve the desired 
effect. They dnnk more 
than they intend to, 
experience tensions in 
their relationships with 

ids, deny having a 
lem with alcohol 



Also known as 
alcoholic amnesia, black- 
outs can occur in any stage 
of these disease. An alcoholic 
in a blackout may appear to 
behave normally, so that the casu- 
al observer might not guess he or 
' c is drunk 

Later on, however, the alcoholic 
will have no recollection of what 
was said or done 

Blackouts can last from a few 
minutes during a night of drinking 
up lo several days during a pro- 
longed period of binge drinking. 
They are one of the more frighten- 
ing symptoms that alcoholics expc- 
nence.

Br Tony Laux 
Sports Editor 

Lasi year the Mastodons 
climbed back into the national pic- 
lure wiihavery young team. Coach 
Amie Ball eniers his 18th season 
and has compiled a 291-212 record 
ai IPFW The team is currently 
ranked 5(h in the nation afier a 
strong performance al the Santa 
Barbara Invitational, where the 
Dons placed third overall Ball felt 
that the tournament in California 
was a good gauge to see where his 
team was. 

Last year's team placed third in 
the Midwest Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association (MIVA) and 
was ranked I2th overall in the 
American Volleyball Coaches 
Association (AVCA) final national 
poll. 

The key losses from last year's 
learn are Brad Prieditis and all- 
Mi VA middle hitter Mike Ter 
Molen, but with twelve reluming 
leitermen and four starters, Ball 
thinks "the team is very capable to 
compete with the teams in the top 
ten." 

Two huge additions to the team 
are Ricardo Soler and Chris Fanner, 
Fanner missed last season with a 
heart condition, and Soler, an all- 
MIVA pick two years ago, skipped 
last year to return to Puerto Rico. 

Returnees from last year's team 
are Ryan Perrotte (Junior. Middle 
Hiiter, Starter), Javier Escobar

Ball's team strength has to be 
its depth and ability to play at a high 
level on offense, but the glaring 
weakness is the team's ability to 
serve aggressively, play good 
defense and make good blocks.

schedule If this team wants to make 
it to this year's NCAA tournament 
in Hawaii, they will have some 
tough competition on the way. Ohio 
State, Loyola-Chicago and Lewis 
are always tough and the Dons will 
have to face last year's MIVA cham- 
pion Ball Slate twice 

"This team is very athletic and 
has the potential to be very compet- 
itive. It has a real strong possibility 
lo make the NCAA tournament," 
said Ball. But for the team to make 
the tournament Coach Ball wants 
some people to make contributions. 

"It all starts with Ricardo Soler, 
we need consistent leadership 
because he will be the staning point 
of the learn. The team needs good 
passing from Soler, Javier Escobar 
and Hector Soto," he said. 

Since the team's strength is 
offense "consistent offensive play 
setting will be needed from Chris 
Gisslen," he added 

Ball compared this team to his 
1991-1994 team "This team will be 
flying high and we are hoping to get 
some suppon and make the school 
proud." 

The Dons open their season on 
the road for the whole month of 
January with games at Ohio State, 
Mercyhurst and Penn State.
