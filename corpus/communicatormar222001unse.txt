At Ihc 2001 Miss Gay IPFW Pageanl, livo 
sccunty guaidi were required lo be presenl. U.S.

Sterling bioughl ICLU inio the mal

Sterling added thai "it is hoped that the u 
versiiy will keep this issue in mind when they arc 
working on the new security guidelines and whi 
anil how they apply those guidelines in the Tmui 
Wc may not be the only organization that cou

benefit all student groups." 

The ICLU letter goes on to say that IPFW's 
requirement of Uniled Seiualilies to foot the bill 
(SHO) for the guards also "violates Ihc First 
Amendmenl rights of (U.S.t." 

The letter ended by urging the university to 
rescind ils policy and wilhdraw its demand for 
payment for the guards. 

Wall Branson, vice chancellor of Financial

Two student leaders have taken [heir own 
lives during the last three mondis. 

According to Don Smith, personal coun- 
selor al IPFW. depression affects at leasl 10 per- 
ccnloflhe population. Twice as many females as 
males have depression, while males arc twice as 
likely as females to commit suicide. 

There is help, however, for people who have 
depression or have thought about suicide. "Eighty 
to 90 percent of people who seek help for major 
depression get relief in (WO lo four weeks," Smilh 
said, "Medication and psychotherapy are belter 
than ever... clinical depression is a biochemical 
imbalance in Ihe brain and is treatable," 

Smith, whose oilicc is in Room 111 of Walb 
Union, is available to those in need of assistance. 

He said suicide rates among young people 
are on the rise and the onset of depression is often 
an indicator of other physical problems, 

"Depression can be a sign of the beginning 
of diabetes or other illness," Smilh said. For that 
reason, he insists upon Ihe intervention of a 
physician and a physical assessment when pro- 
viding ircalmenl. He added (hal substance abuse 
■ depression often arc inlerrelatcd and 



on -campus groups (including the Vice- 
Chancclliw's Wellness Council) and is r^inning 
for president of Student Body, wants to stan up a 
suicide/crisis hotline for the IPFW community. 

Wade said he spoke with Smilh. who agmd 
lo answer calls during the day if the plan is 
implemented, 

"I diink il's important because we've lost 
iwo people in the last three months." Wade said, 
"About three years ago we losi a professor. Two 
people in three months is a bunch."

Subway opens on campus 



The IPFW Purchasing Depanmcnt and Ihe 
Subway Food Company have teamed up to offer 
students a more selective menu through the new 
Subway Subshop. Opened on the ground floor of 
Keltk-r Hal! during spring break for a ninety-day 

the subshop operates Monday-Friday from

After Subway contacted Ihe Purchasing 
epartment earlier in the year, cj;prcssing interest 
I opening a store on campus, a survey was given 
I staff and students. The survey found that more 
lan 60 percent of respondents would more than 
kely cat al Subway if it were on this campus. 
Hobbs said IPFW is trying to figure out how 
fQod service on campus will be pnjvlded after the 
Aramark contract en pi res. 

"Whether or not Subway Subshop will slay 
this campus iSi partly dependent upon Ihecon- 
:liencc of the food service provider we will 
select. However, Ihe determining factor is the

. Hobbs said. 
ly franchiser Jack Miller said Ihal 
Subway shops operating al other colleges have 



Students purchase subs al fha nev/ Subway ir 

from. We appreciate the warm welcome and kind- 
ness of the school," Miller said. 

According lo Trevor Bell, manager of 
Subway Subshop at IPFW, it is easier to work nt 
a college campus, as opposed lo the regular 
stores. Pan of the reason for this, he said, was that 
the customers at college locations were often 
more congenial than at regular slorcs- 

Sinee Subway opened on campus, students 
have avidly patronized the shop. "We have 
approximately 250 customers per day," Bell said. 

The shop offers a variety of subs. The 
"Seven Subs Under Six Grams of Fat'" option 
icorporalcs food ranging from Ihe least eipen- 



sivc Veggie Dclitc which costs S2.Z9 (or a si«- 
inch and S3.49 for a 13-inch, to the most enpcn- 
Sive Roasi Beef, Subway Club and Turkey Breast 
and Ham which cost S3. 29 for a sii-inch and 
S4.99 for the 12-inch. The "Subway Classics" 
Opiion ranges from Ihe least expensive Subway 
Club at S3.29 for the si»-inch and ia.&lt;S9 for the 
fool- long- 
Fresh Value Meals, which include a sand- 
wich, 21-ouncc drink and chips or two cookies, 
are also offered, Ffuizle Smoodiies Exprcssos are 
offered in a vajieiy of flavors like the Berry 
'Lishus and the pineapple delighl.

Ihc actual helium convent of the universe closely match the
