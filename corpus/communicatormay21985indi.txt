A three person team chaired by

review o( Ihc department's t9Sl-M 
academic year. Last December, the 
team visited the IPFW department for 
a n ths i le evaluatl 00. 

In its review, the team discovered 



two problem areas. The first dealt wllh 
the Master's program curriculum 
which could be sdvcd by adding six 
additional credit houn The second 
problem dealt with the established 
pronlc records of departmental

are the ones— the only ones — directly 
responsible for the funding we did get. ■ 

When the new fmc arts building finally 
stands on the grounds of this campus, we

of the enthusiasm of a bygone era, a CamclolklndDf Ume

CM this campus there is a shorl-slghled disregard for

The team batUng average is

The good news? Maybe Ihe 
best news for ihe basetull

IPFW had s rough week, 
losing all six of the games 
they played. First. Grand 
Valley State handed IPFW 
11-T and 6-3 decisions last

It's adequate, but ni 
the opposition scores eight 
ruis a ball game," said 
IP F W coach Lee DeTurii . 

DeTurk added that, in 
Sunday's second game with 
Valpo, he was pleased in the 
play of the squad. 

"Even though we're not 
winning, in some cases, 
we're playing well. In 
baseball, you can play well 
and still get best," said 
DeTurt, in his second season 

A bright spot lately (or

At the beginning of the se 
Lee DeTlirii felt a 5O0 re

son. IPFW coach 
urd by the team 
would be GuUlandlng because of the tough 
schedule IPFW would face The schedule has 
proven lo be tougher than eipected. as the 
Mastodons are 6- IT with eight games 
remaining. And ihe schedule [robably will 
remain lougb nenl year, according lo 

"There's Jusl not a lot of Division II schools 
inthisarea,"saldDeTuric. 

And if IPFW chooses to pUy several 
Division III or \AIA division schoois and has 
a good &gt;-ear, the Dons may not be included In 
any post-season tournament because they 
playedsomaoysmailersc hools. 

One ^rt of ihe 1985 ieam DcTurli felt 
would be stronger than preiiiaus years was 



ihe pitching. But the pllching slalf hu not 
proven itself on the Meld, allwlng over eight 
carnal runs a game. Any Improvement neil 
year would come from experience this year 

' In rccrulilng. 

"Recruiting starts now and runs to the 
sectional. The neut three weeks are very 
important." said DeTurlc. 

Some highllghia from the 19U season have 
Included the whis at Dayton and (he 
University of Cindnnatl. twlh Division I 
(chools Trips south like the Daylm snl

At any rate, the IMS season wa« one In 
which IPFW took a lot of lumps from some 
top-nolch programs. One can only hope that 
wilh some luck, good recruits and ex- 
perienced rebimlng players, IPFW will be 
able to dish out so me lumps ne:i( season.
