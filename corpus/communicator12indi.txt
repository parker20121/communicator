A conservative estimate 



Student President against Moratorium 



I have bet!ii askL'd lo clve my 
viawB on the moratorium, both 
otflclally and privately. 

0(flc;lally, i feel that each 
student should (let ermine for 
himself whether hP should march 

debate, except by pxpresslng my 
personal views In a small flyer, 
because 1 [eel as Sludanl Body 
presldeni, 1 represent the entire 
Gtmlent body uhlc^h was much too 
divorsllled for me to take an 
(iKIclal position. 1 tell 1 could 
not separate my personal and 
niriclal roles to the exienl need- 
ed lo voice my opinions publicly. 

TIr' Student Assembly, as a 
body, roll the same as landvoled 
a non-lnler[orence policy In the 
moratorium. However, as Indivi- 
dual senators, Ihey felt Ihey could 
tnilet'd represent I he student body 
and Ks many diverse opinions 
and therefore, as Individuals and 
senators, they entered the debate. 

They did In fact represent the 
sludenl body In that there were

be ihree major goals: 1) Initiate

ther develop presenl student 
"leaders" and 3) recomtnend 
solutions for solving present 
lampus problems. 

The malor problem was de- 
termining who .&lt;ihould l&gt;e Inviied. 
Those students servUlg i-ither on 
the Senate or the Union Hoard 
were Invited as well as other 
leaders such as Cordell Mathleu, 
Student Body President, and Ron 
Rice of Project Abelard. Dean

How does one rhoose twenty- 
five freshmen from approximate- 
ly nineteen hundredT We con- 
sidered many methods and fin- 
ally settled on a combination. We 
first limited It to only those 
freshmen attending orientation. 
Of those, we sorted out atiout 
two hundred to interview. Then 
about twenty-five of those inter- 
viewed were selected. 

This may .seam arbHr3ry,but 
one doesn't invest six hundred 
dollars In students who have 
never, In the past, dc'monstrated 
oulstattdlng leadership qualities. 
It's true that there wilt be "late- 
one before "blooms". 

We feel the Leadership Re- 
treat was surn-s.sfiil. The pre- 
sent student leaders learned 
much, as well as getllne many 
excellent suggestions and pro- 
posed solutions. .\Iain of the

At the same lime, we urge 
students Interested in Student 
Government or the Studeni Union 
Board to Join. Just because you 
didn't attend the Leadership Re-

of being In Student Government. 
We are considering haUng anoth-

I Would like lo consralulato 
you and ihe Communicator staff 
for tlie (bie coverage of the two 
major views cuncenilng the re- 
cent .Maralorlum. However, (or

of S.A. M, should be further ex- 
plained. 

As thename(SiudentsAB»insl

organization opposes the ^to^a- 
lornim Iwcause It Is felt that 
the Moratorium places stress In 
the wrong place, namely Ihe pre- 
senl admlnlstrallon. Instead of 
the Communists In North Viet-

Is to back the policies of Iho
