Take Arms... 

...against that sea of boredom. 

Join the Communicator staff. 

If you are the average commuter type student 
who wants to get more out of your campus 
experience than drab, institutional green class- 
rooms, try us. You'll like us, and you'll be 
involved. 

The pay is meagre, but the hours are 
beautiful. 

Working conditions are better than those in 
your average salt mine. 

But if you like to write, you'll gain rewards. 

You've got plenty of time to think it over while 
you're languishing through spring break. 

After that, we'll be taking applications for 
next year's staff. Drop in and fill one out any- 
time. We're in Suite 215 in the Walb Memorial
