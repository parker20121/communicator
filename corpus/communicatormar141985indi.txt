He replaces Maurice Shady, who left 
IPFW Jan 31. 

"His (Gaffsi understanding nf this 
campus is a greal benefit," Carnaghi 
said "He's spent nearly one-thtrd of 
his life on this campus, as bolh a 
student and police ofricer. So he 
clearly understands the role of the 
police, and Is Just as aware of the 
problems of being a student. " 

Gaff, 30, has been a student at IPFW 
since 1976, having earned a bachelor's 
degree in general studies during Ihat 
period. He also has an associate's 
degree in administrative Justice from 
Los Angeles Community College - 
Overseas 

He joined the IPFW poliec force In 
1977, serving as a student security 
guard. In 1979 he became a police 
officer alter graduating from the 
Indiana Slate Police Academy. He was 
promoted to the r^nk of sergeant 
during Shady's term ol office. 

"I really enjoy working here." Gaff 
said. "And I enjoy Ibe students. I'm 
looking forward to the opportuni^ of 
working U'llh them."

position, he would be 
ncia evon more responsible than olher 
students for his behavior. It was a 
facet of Ihe job he said he expected, 
though. 

He also does not foresee a conflict 
with the other officers, with whom he 
has been used to sharing duties, 

"It's not my department, it's our 
deportment." Gaff said "Still. I'll 
depend heavily on those who work 
under me." 

l^rnaghi said Gaff's appoin 
had been supported by others on Ihe 
police force. He saw that as a sign of 
GafPs potential for functioning ef- 
ficiently as chief. 

"The job is a challenge," Gaff said. 
"But I think 1 can do a lot for the 
univerally," 

Some of Gafrs long range goals 
Include becoming more involved with 
the shidcnl government, as well as

Although an associate degree in 
criminal justice has be*n offered al 
IPFW for several years, IPFW 
students could not receive a BSCJ at 
the Fori Wayne campus. After ob- 
taining an associate degree in criminal

"We (IPFW) cssentiaUy had

Charles. IPFW mainly restructured 
our OKlsling program

Graduates of Ihe r 
program can pursue careers as police 
officers, planners and researchers (or 
police agencies, court administrators,

also would provide appropriate

Congress considers

Staff Writer 

Despite sharp changes in federal 
student aid proposals, the IPFW 
Financial Aid Office has a wait-and- 
see attilude. 

Joan Eaton, assistant director of 
financial aid, say-s sludents should not 
be too concerned. 

"Since these changes would not be 
effective until the 1986-87 school year, 
we want to wail and see what Congress 

A major adminislratioa proposal 
would be lo place an annual cap of 
H.VOO on fedoal aid to each student, 
including Pell grants, loans and work- 
study earning.

proposed a restriction on independent 
Student status, requiring all applicants 
below 32 years (o be classified as 
dependent on their parents. This would 
place more emphasis oa parental 
responsibility for meeting college 
costs, says the Education Department. 

Eaton says a $32,500 family adjusted 
gross income limit has been proposed 
for the ^aranteed soideat loan 
program. This guideline would have 
affected 18 percent of Unse IPFW 
students receivtng a guaranteed

Mandatory seatbelt 
violates Constitution 



We're nol sure who Invented walhcHs 
wllh shoulder straps, but it's a sure bet it 
wasn't an averwdfChl perton. Bn ar- 
Ihrilic old genllfrman. or a well-endnwcd 
woman. The rest of the world might not 
think too much about It. but tot certain 
people wearing n seatbelt is downright 
dIKIculi 

But actually, sestbclls aren't all th^t 
hardtogetusedtolfyoujuslglve thema 
chance. Remember when you had to 
force ybursell to drink diet pop when it 
tasted like yeehh? Well, it got a little 
canler o» lime went by. didn't 11? And 
pretty soon you couldn't taste Ihe sac- 
charin anymarc, nnd began to tell the 
rest of the world to "just give It a 
chancel" 

Now the supreme lawmakers of 
Indiana arc trying lo make the wearing 
ofscalbelUmandatory. Whalbclierway 
lo keep people from wearing their 
Bcalbclts? Violate Iheir Cons lilu liana I 
right lo be idiots! 

The proposed law is In the best interest 
of Ihe people, of course. Fewer people 
would probably die if the law were 
strictly obeyed and enforced. But It - 
won't do any good. Any Inlelligcnl 
person already knows how unattractive 
a person is iMund to look after their head 
has hit the windshield and shattered II ... 
as they live in their casket. 

And whotarcnduilAbutgrawn up little 
kids? Tell them they must do something, 
and they're bound to do Just the opposite, 
especially it they feel their right lo make 
their own decisions Is at stake, 

Should Ihe laws protect people from 
their own stupidity or lailness? If so, the 
lobncco producers are going lo get 
mighty riled, Everyone knows 



. and thej' 
harmful eftecLs on innocent bystanders 
as well. Surely if the law is going to 
protect us from oursclvs by forcing us 
to tHlckle up, it won't be long tieTore we 
can't smoke. And it won't be long l&gt;elore 
the American llBarl Association will be 
lobbying to ban sales of Twinkles and 
Hagan'Daa^ chocolate chip ice cream, 
as millions of Amencans are eating 
themselves into on early grave. 

Proponents of the sealbclt law say il 
will help protect minors whose parents 
have never really considered seatbells 
lo be terribly important. 

If ihal's their best 
dating sealbelts, then maybe a better 
solution would be lo make 11 mandatory 
for minors lo wear seatbells until they 
reach the age ol sixteen, at *ihich lime 
they would be allowed to make their own 
decision about whelher or nol to buckle 
up — but only after viewing Tiims of 
gruesome accidents in which the victim 
was nol wearing a seatbelt. 

If kids got used lo wearing seatbells. 
chances are they would continue 
wearing them all their lives. Parents 
who plop their children In a car without 
mahingsurc they arc reasonably certain 
□f surviving the trip should tie fined. 

It's a funny thing about seatbells. 
Users swear by the things and swear 
they feel naked without one. Non-users 
generally are not just absent-minded 
about putting one on. They are adamant 
aboul not wearing il, and swear they 
wouldn't be caught dead buckling up 
every lime they got in the car. Judging 
by what sheriffs and emergency medical 
service people say, however, there are a 
lot more people caught dead without one 
than with one.

or Indiana Stale-Evansvilte. 
He's a great player 

My GLVC all-star team 
starts with senior guard Ray 
Harper, of Kentucky 
Wesle&gt;'an Harper made the 
steal that led to the PsTt- 
Ihera' 71-69 victory over 
IPFW March Z. He also ran 
(he Panthers' offense with 
Intelligence. The o(her guard 
would have to be Mark Cock, 
of IPFW. Cook seemed to 
play with the kind of in- 
tensity that might even 
moke Bobby Knight happy 

Since IPFW didn't tiave a 
Inie center, my team won't 
have a (rue center either. 
Jell Fullove wwjid tie Ihe 
Ihlrd guard or small forward 
on this team. Lewis' Bobby 
Tribble would be the fourth 
guard. Tribble scored the 
game- winner against IPFW 
Feb. 9. Tom Niego, with his 
bruuiing inside games, 
should be on the team as a 
sb-ong forward. The inside 



Wilsom and Freundt provide 
the kind of strength that 
compliments a player os

Lewis' Rosemary Turner 
and tPFWs Rita Boyle 
belong at guards. Turner
