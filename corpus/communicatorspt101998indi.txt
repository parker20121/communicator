Anse! Adams exhibit in the Fort 



by Carrie Anne Leathers 
Chief Reporter 

Over 100 photographs by the famous pho- 
tographer Ansel Adains will be visiting the Fort 
Wayne Museum of An as part of the "A Legacy: 
Maslerworks from The Friends of Photography 
Collection." 

The exhibition will open on Dec. 5, 1998, 
and run through Feb. 14. 

"Ansd's work is brilliant," IPFW student 
Holly Jafri said. "He paved Hie way for a lot of 
landscaping photographers." 

Landscape photography was Adams' mosi 
most common subject, although he also did 
some intimate portraits and close-ups. 

He helped push photography towards being 
viewed as an art form and not just a product of a 
machine. 

"He made us more aware of the spectacular 
scenes and views of the West and ^specially 
Yosemite National Park," IPFW student and 
Sales, and Rental Coordinator for the Fort Wayne 

"The snapshot is not as 
simple a statement as 
some may believe. It 
represents something 
that each of us has seen- 
more as human beings 
than photographers- and 
wants to keep as a 
memento, a special thing 
encountered." 
-Ansel Adams 



Museum of An Vanessa Freygang said. 

Adams, who was bom in 1902. First found 
his love Tor Yosemite at the age of 14, when he 
visited die park with his family. 

Not quite sure what to expect, Adams was 
overwhelmed and saw great beauty in the sun- 
light and rivers, but also something even more 
significant to him, according to his autobiogra- 
phy, "A New Era Began for Me." 

In the following summers of the next few 
years, Adams continued to photograph 
Yosemite. 

To him, photographs were the result not only 
of what one saw, but of what the photographers 
had experienced and caused them to first take 
the photograph. 

"You don't make a photograph just with a 
camera," Adams said. "You bring to the act of 
photography all the pictures you have seen, all 
the books you have read, the music you have 
heard, the people you bave loved." 

This applied to his Yosemite photography, as 
well. 

Although he stood by the idea that his pho- 
tographs there were documentary rather than 
artistic or expressive, he was still aware of the 
principle of personal influence. 

"The snapshot is not as simple a statement 
as some may believe," Adams said. "It repre- 
sents something that each of us has seen — more 
as human beings than photographers— and 
wants to keep as a memento, a special thing 
encountered." 

One of Adams' more technical accomplish- 
ments was in his ability to visualize how he 
wanted a print to appear, despite how it looked 
through his camera upon phoiographing it 

His first breakthrough with this also came at 
Yosemite on the day that he photographed the 
North Dome, Kings River Canyon. 

"I had achieved my first true visualization!" 
Adams wrote later. "1 had been able to realize a 
desired image not the way the subject appeared 
in reality but how it felt to me and how it must 
appear in the finished print." 

Although Adams' work is sometimes criti- 
cized for being merely landscape photography 
and nothing monumental or extraordinary, pub- 
lic appeal is enough to cause one 10 reexamine 
his work. 

Adams did more than just photograph natur- 
al scenes, he captured moods and, in some ways. 
a view of the natural world that would have been 
missed by the naked eye. 

"1 think that his work has brought photogra- 




phy 10 a new level," Freygang said. 
"The technical skill involved and how he manip- 
ulated them, produced an excellent image." 

These images are what have attracted eyes 
to his work over and over again, even since 
Adams' death in 1984. 

People often know his work without even 
knowing that it was photographed by him. 

"His images are very widely merchandised. 
You see a lot of his work in many of the local 
shops in the mall and a lot of people like it," 
Freygang said. "People know his images, but not 
his name." 

The exhibit coming 10 the museum is a col- 
lection of an earlier exhibit called The Friends of 
Photography, which ran in 1983 and toured 
throughout the world. 

These had been photographs that Adams had 
taken near the end of his life to which he had 
applied his style to subjects besides landscape. 

The photographs selected to make up the 
exhibition coming to Fort Wayne represent 
works of Adams that are believed to be his final 
portrayal of his versatility as a photographer. 

Tickets for the exhibition will go on sale 
Thursday, Oct. 1, and will be available in the 
Museum Shop for S4 per person (cash/check 
only). 

Tickemasier oudcis will also have the tickets 
for S4 and phone orders may also be made, but 
cost S4.50. 

Before the regular exhibition opens, a 
Preview Reception on Friday, Dec. 4, at the Fort 
Wayne Museum of Art will discuss the life. 
limes, and photography of Adams. 

Reservations to attend can be made by con- 
tacting the museum and the cost for non-mem- 
bers is 58 (members S6).

Purcell said. "Students 
keep coming out with a

sometimes with fairly

both of which can place

Besides students 
in the area, over 33 per- 
cent of the total enroll- 
ment for IPFW's fall 
semester came from 
outside of Allen 
County. 

Borelli believes 
that besides accommodating such 
students, resident halls arc one of 
the future additions to the campus. 
"Resident halls would provide 
a fuller college experience for stu- 
dents," Borclli said. "I'm confident 
that it will happen in the ncxl 10 
years." 

There were also 956 students 
that transferred to IPFW for the fall 
semester This is not unusual for 
the university. 

"Far more students transfer in 
than leave IPFW for olher institu- 
tions." Borelli said. "There have

Minority enrollment for

Overall, full lime enrollment 
has also increased by 467 students.

Topic: 

Campus Parking 

Our Verdict:: 

Something has 
to be done to fix 
the confusion 



When was the last limti thai 
you remembered actually seeing 
ihe A-parking section full? 

You know ihe section that 



vhere all of 
the professors and other privi- 
leged faculty park. 

It appears all of the places 
in A-parking are seldom taken. 

Actually, the only lots that 
ever appear to be full arc the 
one by the library and the one at 
the Gales Sports facility. 

Why do the students have lo 
struggle for spaces to park, 
when the faculty always have 
close parking? 

Sometimes we feel as if we 
have to walk from New Haven 
to get to class because we have 
to park so far away. 

We know that (his is a sub- 
ject that is as old as lime on this 
campus, but there is something 
that has to be done. 

We're glad that there was

anolher parking garage 
added, but why docs 
there have lo be A 
parking in the garage. 

There aren't many 
classrooms out that 
way, so why docs there 
need to be more A 
parking when the rest 
of the A permit parking 
isn't fully used? 

It doesn't make 
much sense to us. 

Anolher problem 
that we have with the 
parking situation is 
that there are way too 
many meters here on 
campus. 

It seems like it's 
just anolher way lo 
nickcl-and-dime Ihe 
students into poverty. 

We can understand 
having the metered 
parking in front of Ketller hall, 
because there are many impor- 
tant offices in that building, but 
having them in parking garages 
is a little silly. 

In the past, metered parking 
was for the campus visitors. 

It seems lhai most of ihe 
mclers turned into students- 
thal-are-late-for-class parking. 

By the way, when did the A 









IA_\i 



parking signs come up in the 
new parking garage? 

One day Ihey weren't there, 
and ihe ne&gt;tt day, people were 
confused about whether or not 
they were parking in the wrong 
sections. 

Many people are concerned 
about whether or not ihey are 
going to get a parking ticket 
while on campus, simply 



because the regulations and 
changes aren't always very 
clear. 

Just a reminder: If you 
choose not to pay a ticket, you 
won'i be able lo register for 
classes for [he next semester. So 
pay your fines on lime! 

The thing that would proba- 
bly help Ihe most is posting Ihe

sight in more areas on campus 
or sending out notices about Ihe 
changes. 

Most people know how 10 
park, but a lot of the time a 
number of the campus parking 
areas are a little confusing. 

In some of the parking 
areas, maybe better usage of 
signs would help lo clear things 
up for a few people.

PTC Efficiency 



] would like to take this 
time to comment on the 
usage of the Technology 
Fee. 

For the past two years 1 
have done nothing but 
degrade the powers that 
be, who allocate the funds, 
for not really taking the 
time to use this fee for the 
betterment of the students. 

Sure new teaching labs 
have been opened but for 
the past two years, and 
millions of dollars of our 
money, only one open 
access lab was established. 

Yet when I arrived on 
campus this year, I could 
not help but notice two 
more open access labs are 
in operation. 



Not only that but CD- 
ROM drives have been 
installed in the existing 
labs that 1 have seen. 

I want to thank Ihose 
responsible for these 
changes for now maybe 
the students can find a 
computer, and we won't 
have to hear the attendants 
asking us to log off 
because students can't find 
an open spot. 

Keep up the good work 
and remember that the stu- 
dents are paying for 
improvements for the rest 
of this University's life. 



Kerry Adkins 
Student 



In the past six months, there has 
been an intense study concerning the 
Public Transportation Corporation, 
or PTC. In an attempt to improve on 
the local transportation system, the 
United Way of Allen County has, 
along with the city's Planning 
Department and other various agen- 
cies, developed a transit survey. This 
information will be used to make the 
City's bus system more efficient. 

Unfortunately, many of you in 
our educational institutions, who 
need transportation to and from 
school, have not been adequately 
represented. 

Realizing this, we have decided 
that in order for the system to work 
better for you, we need your input. 
Whether riding once a week or 
everyday, the information you pro- 
vide is vital to insure that the PTC 



reflects the needs of you; the stu- 
dent, the parent, and the employee. 

The survey not only asks about 
ridership and class times, but work- 
times, and also childcare. We feel 
that this data is important because 
IPFW students account for a large 
number of PTC riders. 

In the same manner, it is also sig- 
nificant for those with transportation 
needs that are not being met by the 
current system. 

If you need transportation, or 
know someone that does not have 
reliable transportation, now is your 
chance to be heard. 

In the upcoming weeks, an IPFW 
student (our research assistant) will 
be handing out surveys at the bus 
stop in front of Kettler Hall on 
Monday and Tuesday Mornings. We 
ask that you fill them out as com- 



pletely as possible and return them 
when you return for classes on 
Wednesday and Thursday, as he will 
be there again to collect them. 

If you cannot return them, then 
arrangements will be made to have 
them picked up, or a "drop-box" 
will be provided. 

The improvements made to our 
community's transit system will be 
based on the suggestions of the com- 
munity, and especially you, the 
clients. 

We need your help in these deci- 
sions and we hope you will respond. 



Sincerely.

What's weak this week 



by Dennis Donahue 



I have always wondered about 
people who break (he law. Whai 
exactly separates the "normal" 
from the "abnormal"? How can 
some citizens of this planet be so 
wonderful in (heir daily lives, and 
yel others can be so horrible. Are 
you. or someone you know on the 
edge of deviant or ami-social 
behavior? Whal are the signs? 
What has happened to the world 
we live in? Can this problem be 
fixed? Can we as students, the 
future of this country, make it bet- 
ter? 

Some say that life is only as 
bad as we make it. We all control 
our own destiny right? Does this 
mean I can drive anywhere at any- 
time of the day or night without 
having to worry about being car- 
jacked? Do I travel, knowing that a 
plane could crash because some 
terrorist feels that bombing a jet is 
good for his cause? Is traveling 
even safe anymore? And exacdy 
how safe are the highways of 
America? Whal psycho full of 
'road-rage' will blow my head off 
when I honk at him for cutting me 
off? 1 don't believe in fate. I don't 
think that you can be "at the wrong 
place at the wrong lime." I just 
don't buy it. Call me paranoid, call 
me a pessimist. 



Whenever I find out that inno- 
cent people are hurt or killed by an 
unnatural act, it makes me think, 
"How can someone hurt another 
person who has done nothing to 
him or her?" Random violence has 
become widespread Crimes are at 
an all-time high. Theft, rape, petty 
crimes can happen anywhere to 
anybody. Think aboul the ones that 
aren't reported. Breaking into 
someone's house is wrong, but 
hurting them is worse. Break into 
my house, you won't need an 
ambulance, you'll need a bag. You 
think I'm a hypocrite for saying 
that? Sure, "but I'm not going to let 
you hurt me or anyone else. I also 
don't want my taxes to pay for (he 
weights you lift, and (he cable tele- 
vision that you watch in prison. 

See, you waived your rights 
the minute you walked onto my 
property with the intent to take 
something that wasn't yours: 
something that I worked for, some- 
thing that is mine. This gives me 
the right, as a victim, to lake care 
of whai is mine. Then some lousy 
lawyer will screw it up, and I'll go 
to jail. Do victims even have rights 
anymore? Oh, did I hurt the poor 
criminal? Hey, the system protects 
these idiots. 

Maybe that is the problem 



within itself. Are the sentences in 
this country tough enough to even 
be considered a deterrent'* What do 
you think about the death penalty? 
If killing a person is so terribly 
wrong, what then gives us (he right 
lo lake their life? We're killing 
someone because they killed 
someone. Talk about hypocritical. 
This doesn't merit much justice in 
my eyes. I think as a nation, we 
have become numb to violence. It 
appears to be all around us The 
music industry, Hollywood, televi- 
sion, the media, check out any 
comic book: guns, guns, guns. 
Ncxi lime you arc at your video 
store, look at (he video box covers. 
Count the guns, even on the so- 
called "comedy films." You'll need 
both hands. Do kids really need to 
sec litis? 

I have always taken the slant 
that children learn what they live. 
Seeing violence in the home breeds 
violence. Abused children will 
more than likely abuse their chil- 
dren. And mat's another thing I 
don't gel. When an abuser says (hat 
ihey themselves were abused, 
either sexually or physically, they 
are forgiven, because of how horri- 
ble their life must have been. Hey, 
if it was so bad, men why did YOU 
commit the same horrendous 



crime? 1 think it was Dennis Miller 
who said: "... if for some rea- 
son...your life has become so con- 
fusing. .thai you feel the need to 
touch a child, you need to kill 
yourself You need to lean into the 
strike zone and take one for the 
team..." I agree. 

We all make excuses for our 
behaviors. "1 was drunk," or "1 did- 
n't think that anyone would get 
hurt" are the worst. Have we basi- 
cally refused to take responsibility 
for our actions? Can we really have 
victimless crimes? 1 look at it this 
way; laws arc created for the igno- 
rant people around us. I read in the 
local paper every morning about 
the scatbelt law in this state. People 
think that this is a violation of their 
rigbis. I always laugh at this state- 
ment. Let me try and explain it to 
you boneheads. You see, smart 
people wear their seatbelts. 
Scatbelt and child-seat laws are for 
those irresponsible parents who let 
their kids run around the back seat. 
I see this all the time. This is so 
dangerous. It makes me sad. 

What aboul gun control? 1 per- 
sonally don't believe in guns, 
except for the one that is registered 
to me. I deserve this gun because I 
obey the law. I practice safe gun 
ownership. No child can get to my 



gun. No burglar can get to my gun 
to use it against me or in another 
crime, I respect the gun that I own. 
We shouldn't all have the right lo 
bear arms; I don't care what the 
Constitution says. 1 love America, 
don't get me wrong. I just think we 
have forgotten what freedom and 
liberty mean. 

So what am I trying to say? 
Follow the rules. If you don't like 
the laws that are set for you, go 
about changing them through the 
political system. Don't blame your 
childhood for how you behave as 
an adult. Stop blaming society for 
your troubles. If you feel oppressed 
because of your race, gender, reli- 
gion, or sexual preference, make 
changes for the good of everyone. 
Stop crying "Foul" when a law 
doesn't suit you. Life isn'i fair. 
That is the best advice I can give. 

Loser of the Week- The 
Hoosier Lottery is coming to town 
tonight. Il is bad enough standing 
behind the lottery players in line at 
the gas station? But, coming to the 
Grand Wayne Center? Are sales 
down in this area or what? 
Promoting gambling is bad. If you 
want, just give me a buck, I'll tell 
you ya' lost. Have a great weekend, 
be nice.

HIV/AIDS 

Q &amp; A 



Q. Can you get AIDS 
from a toilet seat? 

A. No, because even if 
the HIV virus could 
survive on a toilet 
seat, it would have to 
be able to enter the 
bloodstream in order 
for a person to 
become infected. 





If you can't get it when you want it, what good is it? 

Email. While there's no chance you'll ever run out of it, there are times when you need 
it but just can't get to it. Unless, like 20 million other email users, you have Hotmail. 
Hotmail is a free service that lets you get your email from any computer with web access. 
So you can always reach it when you need it.

Features Editor 

Groggily, Tim awoke lo the sounds of 
!■■■!(']. chirping and cars driving past the 
building, 

Lasi nighi was a mistake, he resolved, as 
he began 10 get ready for his first day ai his 
new job. 

Looking around his and Mark's apart- 
ment, Tim observed a pile of bodies, half of 
which he didn't know. 

"Good Lord," Tun thought to himself. 
"If the police came in here, they'd think we 
killed all these people." 

The party may have been a misiake. but 
they all had a good lime from what be 
remembered. 

The people sleeping ii off would proba- 
bly agree, even though he couldn't be sure 
aboui what had happened after he'd gone 10 
bed. 

Careful not lo slep on anyone sleeping. 
Tim grabbed a piece of leftover pizza off of 
the kitchen table and headed out to his first 
day as a paralegal. 

In a house just outside of town, a woman 
was leaving for the same job 

Michelle had !&gt;ecn winking as a parale- 
gal for three years and still hadn't quite mas- 
tered the an of getting out of the house on 
lime. 

In her hectic race to gel ready for work, 
ihough, she'd only forgotten one ihing - 
she'd jusi broken up with her boyfriend 
Friday. 

Today was her fourth day on her own and 
she was doing belter than she probably 
should be doing at this point in gelling over 
Aaron. 

The stunningly attractive man she'd 
interviewed at ihe office Monday may have 
played a catalyst in her not dwelling on ihe 
relationship 100 much, but ihen again the 
day was new and il was hard telling wbai 
would be given to her loday. 

She arrived ai the office to find Tim wail- 
ing on her outside. 

With an apology for being laie, Michelle 
hurriedly opened the door 10 ihe office and 
got to work Iraining Tim. 

Tim seemed lo grasp things prelly easi- 



ly and yei carried himself rather weakly as 
though he was sick. 

He kept insisting he was fine, bul 
Michelle noticed die grimaces of pain lhai 
would sneak across Tun's face from time 10 
lime. Tim appeared to be suffering from a 
hangover. 

With someone else's hands 10 help, ihe 
workload was cut considerably. 

Just the same, wiih someone else lo talk 
to, the lime flew by pretty quickly. 

The conversation was basically stuck on 
work, but little things, such as where Ihey 
both were from, would find its way inio ihe 
dialogue from lime to lime. 

Early in the afternoon the telephone rang, 
breaking an hour of silence enjoyed by both 
Trm and Michelle. 

Michelle let Tim answer the phone, 
despite his being new. and Tun in lum hand- 
ed the telephone to Michelle wiih a puzzled 
look on his face. ApparenUy it was for her. 

"Hello?" Michelle asked, curious about 
whai would cause the look of confusion on 
Tun's face. 

"Who was that guy, Michelle?" the voice 
returned. "Don't take loo long findin' my 
replacement, do ya?" 

"Thai guy is my new co-worker. Aaron," 
Michelle responded wiih agitalion. ""If you 
would've paid attention when 1 was talking 
last week, you would've known thai we 
hired a new paralegal lo help me with the 
work. You'd also remember I told you I 
don't want to speak to you again, so what do 
you want?" 

"I want you back, baby. I can't lake liv- 
ing without you anymore. I cry myself to 
sleep. I can't eat anymore- I'm miserable," 
Aaron said with sincerity. 

"You drink yourself lo sleep, Aaron. I 
know you better than thai, you lush. And if 
you wanted me so badly in ihe first place, 
you wouldn't be miserable. Now leave me 
alone." Michelle hung up ihe phone and 
walked back to her desk, snapping a pencd 
in half to ease her frustration. 

Two minutes later, the telephone rang 
again. "I'll get it again. Don'i worry,'' Tun 
said as he rushed over to the phone. After 
listening to a familiar voice tell him to put 
Michelle on, Tim replied "Didn't you hear 
her? It's over. Get over il." Culling the man 



off in mid-sentence, Tim slammed down Ihe 
phone and walked back 10 his desk. 
Michelle looked at Tun and smiled as he 
weniback lo work. 

Four o'clock came around and Michelle 
was ready to call it quits for the day. 

Between ihe two of them, they'd gotten 
a lot of work done, and things were gelling 
slow again as they both found il hard 10 keep 
busy. "I ihink we'd be safe in leaving for the 
day, Tim." Michelle said with a sigh. 

"Sounds good," Tim said wiih a stretch. 
"I'm kinda geilin' Ured, personally. Golta 
gel out and do something or I'll lose my 
mind." 

"I heard thai," Michelle chuckled back. 
Getting her things together, she gave inio 
spontaneity. "Hey, you don' I have any plans, 
do you? I could use some coffee myself and 
would love il if you came along." 

"No, I don'i, but I was kinda hopin' for a 
beer. Coffee doesn't have the same appeal to 
me right now." Tim replied, eyes twinkling. 
"I know a good bar a few minutes from 
here." 

"Beer doesn't really appeal to me lhai 
much," Michelle countered wiih doubi in 
her voice. 

"Well, it is a bar and I'm sure they have 
coffee there," Tun said with a smile. "They 
have to use something to get the more 
respectable types lo come in regularly." 

"Umm, 1 don't know,,. I don't really like 
bars." 

"Come on," Tim said enthusiastically. 
"You'll like this one. Let's go." 

"All right. I guess I can go this one lime," 
Michelle said. 

As Michelle turned out the lights, Tim 
wailed and ihey walked out to his car 
together 

As they drove, Tim couldn't help bul 
smile as he thought to himself whai may lie 
ahead. 

All Michelle could do was batter her 
mind wiih questions in regard 10 Tim's pref- 
erence to a bar over a coffee house. 

"This guy belter not be another Aaron," 
she thought to herself. 

They goi to the bar and took a seal close 
to the door. 

The bar was a lot nicer lhan Michelle 



had expecied ii to be; it was quiet, yet 
seemed lively. 

As Ihe waitress left with their orders. 
Michelle finally decided on an ke breaker. 
"So ihis is how you relax, huh?" she said 
with questioning eyes. 

"Yeah, ihis is one way," Tim casually 
said. "Hang out with my friends, drink some 
beer, have a good time, that about sums il up 
wiih me. What do you do 10 relax?" he 
countered. 

"Usually jusl bang oui around the house," 
she said. "1 used lo go out a lot with Aaron, 
but things didn't quite work out" 
"Oh, thai guy from ihe phone?" 
"Yeah, he's my ex-boyfriend. I don't real- 
ly feel like going into details, but 1 broke up 
with him last Friday. We weren'l gelling 
anywhere, ya know? One of [hose things," 
Michelle said as she sipped her coffee. 
"What about you, do you date a lot?" 

"No, I'm afraid not." Tim said, feeling 
uncomfortable. "Got tired of the game, you 
know? I thought I'd sii back and let things 
fly for a little bit until I know where I'm 
going with 
life. Better not 
to gel distract- 
ed. I go on the 
occasional 
date from lime 
lo lime but 
nothing really 
comes out of

Michelle said 
with a feeling 
of comfort. 

They sat

for a lillle bit. 
enjoying their 
drinks and the 
silence ihey 
shared. 

The con- 
versation was 
soon changed 
10 topics of 
lesser depth 
such as their 



backgrounds. 

Tun told her how he and Mark had come 
down from Massachu sells together after col- 
lege and how his family still lives there 
while Michelle told Tim aboui her days back 
in Iowa and her family in California. 

They both seemed isolated wiih excep- 
tion to a few close friends in the area and an 
occasional telephone call from home. 

After a couple more drinks, ihey both 
decided they should probably be getting 
home. 

Driving Michelle back to the office lo 
pick up her car. Tim couldn'i help noticing 
how beautiful she was and how much they 
seemed lo have in common. 



As he said goodbye to her. an emptiness 
filled his heart and a smile crept across his 
face "Haven't felt like this in a while." he 
thought to himself. 

He sighed a deep sigh of happiness and 
started home to check on Mark.

ON 

Psycho college life 
portrayed on dig screen 



by Adam Taylor 



Features Editor 

Being a product of commuier 
college, I find ii difficult sometimes 
to imagine what living on a college 
campus must be like. 

I've always thought that it 
sounds like a lot of fun, having a 
wide variety of neighbors all my 
age with different interests, and I 
have always considered doing it. 

That is to say, until 1 saw "Dead 
Man on Campus," 

"Dead Man on Campus" is the 
latest production from MTV Films 
about college life. 

A film I would consider to be 
the "Animal House" of the 90s, 
"Dead Man on Campus" is about 
an Indiana boy named Josh and 
his first semester at college 

Upon arriving at college on an 
academic scholarship. Josh finds 
out thai his roommate, Cooper, is 
a total slacker. 

Josh is greeted with a party 
his roommate put together from 
people he met in the lobby. 

At this party Josh meets the 
girl of his dreams, Rachel, whom 
he ends up dating. 

As the semester creeps on. 
Cooper and Rachel play different 
roles in transforming Josb into the 
"Anti-Josh," a fully-fledged party 
machine. 

His grades plummet like a bot- 
tle cap falling to the ground, and his 
midterm exams see him flunking 
all of his classes. 

Things go just as badly for his 
roommate Cooper who finds out at 
midterm that if he doesn't pass all 
of his classes, he's off to work for 
his dad as a professional toilet 
cleaner. 

As the two lament their prob- 
lems 10 one another in a bar. the 
! story 1 CjUfckens as they find out 



from one of the barflies that if their 
roommate kills himself, they'll get 
straight A's. 

Always a capitalist, Cooper 
talks Josh into helping him launch a 
plot to get a roommate unstable 
enough to do the job and get them 
on the road to success 

I see this movie as being one of 
the best college comedies I've seen 
in a long time. 

The writers deal with all of the 
pleasures and pains of seeking a 
higher education in a humorous 
fashion, reminiscent of a National 
Lampoon's movie. 

They deal with all of the dis- 
tractions of college, such as excess 



In their search, they 

uncover a total 

psycho of a fraternity 

member named Cliff 

who almost kills all 

three of them just by 

being himself. 



partying, as well as the frustration 
of going to class with intent to 
learn. 

As funny as the first pan of the 
movie may be, though, it gets even 
funnier when the two roommates 
go out to look Tor a possible "sui- 
cide wailing to happen." 

In their search, they uncover a 
total psycho of a fraternity member 
named Cliff who almost kills all 
three of them just by being himself. 

Other people they find are a 
paranoid genius who thinks Bill 
Gates is trying lo kill him and a 
musician who pretends to be 
depressed in order to get women 
and fame. 

It all ends' erl an ironic note, 



but the ending left me feeling just 
as good about the movie as I did in 
the beginning. 

They wrapped it all up pretty 
well. I thought. 

The actors involved were just 
as well as the screenplay writers. 

It had Tom Everett Scott (who 
played the drummer in "That Thing 
You Do") as the conservative Josh 
and Mark-Paul Gossclaar (Zack 
from "Saved By the Bell") as his 
carefree roommate Cooper. 

Poppy Montgomery made her 
feature film debut as Josh's girl- 
friend, Rachel, and did a fine job 
playing the typical college campus 
girlfriend. 

My personal favorite, though, 
was Lochlyn Munro's portrayal of 
the psychotic Cliff (who eerily 
reminds me of my best friend) 
who enlers the picture throwing 
water balloons at pedestrians from 
atop his frat house, right before 
mooning everyone. 

This guy was a riot, but he was- 
n't in the movie enough to make 
me happy. 

I got duped by the trailers, I 
guess. 

Despite that one flaw, though, 
the movie was great. 

The story may have had its 
weak points, such as the "suicide 
clause" in the college charter and 
Cooper's dad getting rich by own- 
ing a professional toilet cleaning 
business, but oh well. 

It was worth every bit of my 
time if only because I laughed 
through most of the movie. 

I highly recommend this movie 
to anyone with a sense of college 



life.

Radio personality to 
present lecture on 
sex in advertising 



Bob Berkowitz, radio personal- 
ity and former hast of CNBC's 
Real Person, will present "Is There 
Sex after Advertising?" Thursday, 
Sept. 17. at 7:30 p.m. in IPFW's 
Walb Union Ballroom. 

The talk will explore sex and 
"censorship through sponsorship" 
in advertising and media. 

Berkowitz will also share how 
he went from CNN White House 
correspondent to reporting on 
human relationships and sexuality. 

Berkowitz addresses the issues 
of whether or not a show tan be 
controversial and still get ad sup- 
port as well as what happens when 
ad agencies play it too safe. 

According to him, advertisers' 
fear of controversy is causing a 



"blending of the American market- 
place of ideas"--a "censorship 
through sponsorship." 

He argues that advertisers are 
finding it much easier to buy air 
lime during shows they or audi- 
ences "approve of." 

Berkowitz, who has a degree in 
psychology and communications 
from the University of Denver. 
hosted CNBC's call-in show Real 
Person from 1992 to 1996. 

He recently authored the best- 
seller What Men Won't Tell You 
but Women Need lo Know and His 
Secret Life: Male Sexual 
Fantasies. 

Before gaining recognition for 
hi work on human relationships 
and sexuality, Berkowitz worked 



for Associated Press Radio, then as 
CNN White House correspondent. 

He covered such stories as the 
crisis at Three Mile Island and the 
assassination attempt on President 
Reagan. 

"Is There Sex after Advertising" 
promises to be a "provocative and 
humorous look at sex, advertising, 
and the new and improved politi- 
cally correct America." the talk is 
free and open to the public as well.

Internet interests: 



wor 



by Adam Tayloi 



Features Editor 

In dealing with die Internet over 
the past two years. I've discovered 
something amazing: the Internet can 
save a lot of money by offering 
countless sites from which to down- 
load soft ware. 

With this in mind, I've compiled 
a list of various sites on the Internet 
that can save quite a bit of money by 
giving you an opportunity to down- 
load software (or information) at lit- 
tle or no expense. 

Tbe first such site has an amaz- 
ing address: www.download.com 

All this site otters is direct 
downloads of every nature, and it's 
organized in such a fashion to make 
your time spent there well worth it, 
and yet limited. 

Tbe categories offered on this 
site arc Business. Development 
Tools, Drivers. Education, Games, 
Home and Personal, Internet, 
Multimedia and Design, PaimPilot, 
Utilities, and Windows CE. 

In this site, anything you could 
ever imagine being downloadable is 
there. 

The quality of the programs are 
pretty good as well, usually top of 
me line. 

If you ever need a program at 
the last minute and the computer 
store can't help you, this is a great 
site to go to. 

Up there with the latter is 
www.lucows.com, where the same 
service is offered with better 
organization. 

This site is one of my personal 
favorites due to its simplicity. 

The categories are arranged in a 
self-explaining manner that seem 
perfect for those that know as little 
about computers as I do, with sub- 
categories to further simplify the 
otherwise painstaking task of find- 
ing what you're looking for. 



h browsing 



For simplified download ability, 
few can contend with Tucows. 

If you are looking for communi- 
cation software, probably the best 
site (0 visit is www.mirc.com. 

This site is the home base for 
mIRC, which is an Internet Relay 
Chat program that allows you to talk 
to people from all over the world at 
no cost (above your monthly 
Internet bill). 

It's a litUe bit better organized 
than most of the chat programs I've 
seen, since there are thousands of 
different rooms people can join and 
chat in called channels. 

Each channel has its own name 
and the topics usually vary pretty 
well. 

The only problem with this pro- 
gram is that whenever you get thou- 
sands of people together of varying 
interests and backgrounds there can 
sometimes be fights. 

Although the operators of the 
channel can control the channel, lit- 
tle can be done otherwise to regulate 
the program. 

Best advice in dealing with 
mIRC is to be careful what you say. 

It's a great program, as long as 
you're smart about it. 

Another good IRC program to 
download is a program called ICQ. 
Available at www, I cq .com. ICQ ("I 
seek you") is a sort of an Internet 
pager that connects to the ICQ serv- 
er upon connection to the Internet. 

This allows for anyone that has 
a user in their contact list to see 
when that person is online, allowing 
them to send a message to them. 

This can be extremely useful for 
those with friends that live long dis- 
tance, I've found, and can cut back 
on telephone bills considerably. 

I think mlRC's organized a little 
better as far as the chat channels are 
concerned, but I think ICQ's conve- 
nient when considering its "pager" 
capability. 

The next site was a site my little 




sister discovered linked to the 
"There's Something About Mary" 
site, http://www.geocities.com/ 
SunsetStrip/Mezzantne/4480/ 

A site solely dedicated to the 
80s, I found it interesting because it 
brought back a lot of childhood 
memories. 

Although I spent most of my 
lime in the "Cartoons" section, the 
site also includes "Hit Music," "Hot 
Movies," "Rad TV," and "Gnarly 
Fashion" as subdirectories to the 
main site. 

It's a very nostalgic site and 
very hard to leave. 

The final site I accidentally dis- 
covered while searching for a Carl 
Sandburg poem. 

The site, http://www.buff net 
.nel/-mikel/(imeline.h(m), is a site 
designed to display a quick view of 
the history of civilization up until 
the 20th Century. 



It's pretty loose in its descrip- 
tions, but (and perhaps only because 
of my interest in history) I found it 
to be very interesting because of the 
way it put together major historical 
events. 

It's so well-constructed, oDe 
could look at it in great detail and 
probably draw parallels between the 
major events if given the time. 

The author of that site apparent- 
ly had a lot of time on his or her 
hands. 

At any rate, if you ever find your- 
self near a computer lab with noth- 
ing to do, check these sites out 

They are all very well done and 
may even pass the time faster for 



I know they did for me.

Cross Country preview 



by Brian Miller 



Sports Editor 

A new look not only on cam- 
pus bui on this year's cross country 
team looks lo provide e*citemenl 
for Coach Judy Tillapaugh and her 
teams this season. 

Tillapaugh is opiimislic aboul 
both her mens and womens cross 
country team. 

"On the mens side of things, 
we have three guys returning and 
the rest are new faces." 

Three returning key members 
arc seniors Adam Barton and 
David Fooie, and junior Nathan 
Diehl. 

Barton recorded the second 
best time in 1PFW history last sea- 
son with a lime of 27:13. 

Banon has spent a lot of this 
summer working on his lime and 
has shown that he has what it takes 
to be one of the best runners in the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference. 

Although Banon is one of the 
bright spots on the team. Coach 
Tillapaugh is very excited aboul 
her core of freshman. 

Joining the group were rookies 
Paul Trahin from Carroll, Jeff 
Nidlinger from Northrop, Jason 
Sorg from Homestead, Eric 
Marqueling from Bishop Dwenger, 
and Todd Hockemeyer from 
Woodlan. Also new to the team is 
senior Ed Baker. 

Senior David Fooie is very 
optimistic about mis team. 

"1 think wc have a stronger 
team than last year, we have more 
depth, and the learn unity is much 
stronger on the team," Fooie said 

Foote, along with Barton, will 
be called upon 10 lead this team 



"I think we have a 
stronger team than last 

year, we have more 
depth and the team unity- 
is much stronger on 
the team." 



David Foote 
Class of '99 



through a perennially lough GLVC 
conference. 

"So far it is a lot more strenu- 
ous than high school running," 
Trahin said. "The guys are a loi of 
fun, and I think thai we will have 
success this season." 

The learn will be gelling its 
season under way in the 1PFW 
Cross Country Classic. 

"It will really test this learn and 
show ihe newer runners what col- 
lege competition is all about," 
Tillapaugh said, "lam really excit- 
ed lo see how they do." 

Another thing Tillapaugh is 
excited about is ihe womens learn. 
She brings back junior Kelli 
Kunkel and sophomore Janet 
So utter. 

Kunkel has the fourth best lime 
in school history with a lime of 
19:52 and Janet Souder has the 
10th best time with a score of 
21:04. 

Boih have worked together lo 
help each oiher along this season. 
The iwo hope lo improve and make 



their senior season successful. 

Kunkel and Souder, two of the 
besi runners lo go through this pro- 
gram, will have to be consiani and 
superb on a leam thai is not very 
deep. 

They have a few newcomers: 
Amy Nicoll from Pioneer High 
School. Trisha Eifert a junior trans- 
fer from Lansing Community 
College, and senior Julie Von 
Bargon, who is in her Fust year of 
running cross country. 

The lack of depth has really put 
ihis team in a bind. 

In cross country, you need Five 
runners to finish a race lo be able lo 
score. 

Unfortunately for ihe Lady 
Dons, they only have a total of five 
healthy runners. 

However, lo make up for Ihe 
lack of depth they make up for it in 
leam chemistry. 

"1 think it is closer between Ihe 
younger and older team members," 
Julie Von Bargon said. "As a 
whole we gel along really well 
together." 

Like the men the women will 
have their first match here on 
Saturday. 

Some of the oilier top names 
coming io this fall classic are: St. 
Francis. Tri-State. Findlay. Spring 
Arbor, Goshen, Alma College, and 
Heidelburg College. 

The women will run their five- 
kilomeier race at &gt;lQia.m.. and the 
men will start an eighi-kilomeier 
race at 10:45 ajn. 

The leam is always looking for 
new runners to put Ihem over ihe

Sporting world celebrates historic week 



BIG MAC: 62 AND COUNTING 

For some time now, il has been a mailer 
of when and not if Mark Mc 
Gwire would hit his record-breaking 62nd 
home run. The when was answered 
Tuesday in ihe fourth inning of the 
Cardinals' 6-3 victory over the Chicago 
Cubs. 

Cubs pitcher Sieve Traschel is ihe 
answer lo the trivia question, although he 
attempted to downplay his significance in 
the history books. " I think whoever gives 
up the last one (homer) of ihe season will be 
the one that people remember." Nice try 
Steve 

The shot, a line drive into the left field 
stands, travelled only 341 feet. Il was 
McGwire's shortest home run of Ihe season. 

The last week has been very special for 
McGwire. He was able to hit fl's 60,61 &amp;62 
in front of ihe hometown St. Louis fans. 

He hit his 61st on his father John's 61st 
birthday, who was in attendance for the 
game. 

Perhaps the greatest showing of class 
the sports world has seen occurred when 
McGwire honored Ihe Maris family, and ihe 
memory of Roger by including ihem in Ihe 
celebration. 

More importantly to McGwire was 
sharing the moment wilh his son Malt, Ihe 
Cardinals' bat boy as he crossed home plate. 

Although most of us who witnessed his- 
tory on Tuesday appreciate McGwire's 
accomplishments, we will not realize how 
impressive this event was until wc are our 
grandparents' age and someone (Ken 
Griffey IV) will be approaching MCGwire's 
fifty year old record. 

What is truly amazing is Ihe manner in 
which McGwire has handled (he attendon. 
After hilling 58 last season, he was actually 
expected io break ihis record. The reality is 
that most fans are noi surprised, rather. Ihey 
are in awe. 

Such an honor could not have been 
hcsiowed upon any nicer individual The 
consummate team player, who did not wani 
his personal accomplishments to detract 
from the team's focus. (Finishing Lasl) 

Lei us not forget Sammy Sosa, who has 
provided compeiliion, and companionship 
for McGwire, not lo mention a MVP quali- 
ty performance on a team fighting for a 
playoff spot. 

I don't know if these two have saved base- 
ball but they have made ibis a summer to 
remember for millions. Congrats Mac and 
Sammy. 



IRISH FEVER 

The 2-lih ranked Notre Dame Fighiing 
Irish shocked the country Saturday, upset- 
ling ff5-defending national champion, 
Michigan Wolverines, 36-20 in Soulh Bend. 

Il did noi look good early for the Irish. 

Plagued by inconsistency and poor exe- 
cution, the Irish struggled early in quarter- 
back Jarious Jackson's first start. 

The defense compensated by keeping 
the Wolverines out of the end zone for all 
but :23 in ihe first half, where Michigan 
took a 13-6 lead into the intermission. 

Whatever adjustments head coach Bob 
Davie and ihe Irish coaching slaff made ai 
halftime worked brilliantly. 

The option, ineffective in the first half, 
was executed lo perfections Notre Dame 
rolled up thiny consecutive second half 
points. 

On ofrense, die Irish were led by tail- 
back Aulry Denson who finished with 162 
yards and two touchdowns, and Jackson 
who threw for two second half scores. 

The defense was solid, giving up only 
one more touchdown after the game was oul 
of reach. 

Noire Dame's steady, opportunistic 
defense and a strong running game conjured 
up images of the 1988 champs, whose 10 
year anniversary was honored before ihe 
game. 

Co incidentally, that team also opened 
up the season ai home upsetting highly- 
ranked Michigan. 

With their impressive victory Noire 
Dame jumped from #24 to #11 in the polls 
and face a struggling Michigan Slate team 
in East Lansing this weekend. 

The Irish have a long road ahcad.wilh 
one of the nation's most difficult schedules. 
As an Irish fan, 1 enjoyed this victory with 
cautious optimism. 

The Ron Powlus era is behind us, and 
we can look forward to old school Nt&gt; foot- 
ball: jamming the ball down the opponents' 
throats. 

KATZEYE 

Media scrutiny is something that every 
major athlete has to deal wilh at some 
point.whether it is performance- related or 
personal. 

Ohio State LB Andy Katzenmoyer, 
learned how quickly ihey lum when his aca- 
demic eligibility was in jeopardy this sum- 
mer. What lumed out to be a non- story 
was the talk of college football for weeks 
Ihis summer. 

Katzenmoyer was cleared to play last 
week, days before ihe Buckeyes' season 
opener at West Virginia, (which they won 



The Next Mark McGwire? 




34-17). 

Maybe Katz spent more time in die 
weight room than ihe class room last semes- 
ter. As a result, he took a few blowoff class- 
es io boost his GPA. 

He passed all three classes and 
remained eligible. As usual the media blew 
the story out of proportion. 

Katz was maligned for his class load, 
which consisted of golf, music appreciation, 
and AIDS awareness, and was branded Ihe 
typical dumb jock. If ihis 21- year- old kid 
doesn't have enough pressure being the best 
player on the #1 ranked team, he has to lis- 
ten io reports about his eligibility and jokes 
about his intelligence. 

I realize that this kind of scrutiny is ihe 
price lhat these athletes pay. but the only 
way we should hear about his academic 
progress is if he is 
ruled academically 
inclgible. 

Imagine a campus 
of 50,00 wailing to 
find oul how you did 
on your finals, 

Don'i expect 
Katz, lasl years 



Bulkus Award winner to stick around for his 
senior season. 

He is projected as a top 5 pick, possibly 
first overall. 

PEY DAY 

This years #1 pick, Peylon Manning goi 
thrown to ihe wolves in his first NFL start 
lasl weekend, and the results were noi 
prelly. 

The Colts were thoroughly oul- played, 
losing 24-15 io the Miami Dolphins. 

The game was not nearly as close as the 
final score reflected. Allhough Pcyion threw 
for over 300 yards, he also threw three cost- 
ly interceptions, one lhat was returned for a 
touchdown. 

The good news was lhat he did noi get 



injured. 

On a day that saw eight sorting quaner- 
backs lost to injury, Manning looked poised 
under pressure and shook off die hits. 

With a young offensive line and a thin 
corps of receivers, look for the Colts lo 
struggle in Manning's first year, bul GM 
Bill Polian is a proven winner and should 
eventually surround Manning with enough 
taicni to win. 

Parity defines the NFLlhis season. 
While the standard core of good teams will 
be Ihere such as: Green Bay, San 
Fran, Pittsburgh. KC, and Denver, look for 
younger learns to push them including: 
Tampa Bay, Minnesoia, SealUe, the Jets and 
my long-shot Super Bowl tcam--
