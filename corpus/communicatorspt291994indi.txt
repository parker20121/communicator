Internet project at risk 



By S. Brant KcDey 
News EdIIor 

Accessing an oulside computer 
syslem on campus may soon be 
easier, bul It won't happen any- 
time soon. 

Inlemei is a compuier commu- 
nication networit designed lo 
allow a user logged on to one 
compuier syslem to access a daia- 
basc on another computer system. 



During Qie student government 
session on September 26. IPSGA 
President Mark King said the 
Internet system could possibly be 
in place for the fall 1995 semester. 
bul it would rwi be in place during 
the current academic year. 

King said he hopes to hear for- 
mally from the Information 
Technology Steering Committee 
in November on whether Internet 
will be installed at IPFW at all. 



King said the Internet project 
was "rymored dead, but it is not." 

The proposal is presently in the 
Information Technology Steering 
Committee, King said. 

According to King, Ed Katter 
resigned from Computing and 
Data Processing (C&amp;DP) and 
nobody else there would know 
how lo install and run the Internet 
system. 

However, Steve Hollander, 



associate professor of English and 
a faculty adviser for Campus 
Information System Computing 
Organization, said other people in 
C&amp;DP would know how to install 
and maintain a campus Internet 
syslem. 

Hollander said the main con- 
cern over Internet is maintenance 
cost after the system is installed. 

King said there were funding 
problems, as well. 



Anti-harassment policy adopted 



By KrblleRkdSchlundl 
Edilor in Chief 

Effective Sept. 16. Purdue 
University, which has management 
authority over IPFW, adopted a new 
anti-bara.ismcnt policy and interim 
procedures for addressing complaints. 

I^irduc I*resident Steven Beering 
stated, "'Harassment of any kind is 
demeaning, nonproductive and con- 
trary to the ideals of a university. It 
stifles the individual talent that is 
our most precious commodity,, .the 
University does not condone and 



will not tolerate harassment of any 
individual for any reason," 

The most significant language in 
the new policy, said IPFW Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Frank 
Dorelli, is as follows; 

"This policy addresses harass- 
ment in all forms, covering those 
with legally protected status for rea- 
sons of race, gender, reUgion, color, 
age, national origin, ancestry or dis- 
ability, as well as those who are 
harassed for other reasons, such as 
sexual orientation," 

The new policy replaces existing 



harassment and sexual harassment 
policies that were not as broad in 
their scope as the new policy, 
Borelli said, 

"These are guidelines for 
addressing problems," said IPFW 
Chancellor Michael Wartcll. 

Harassment complaints may be 
handled infonnally or formally, said 
Borelli. "Each incident is individu- 
ally evaluated unless it's blatant 
harassment. A case that involves 
simple insensitivily, for example, 
can be dealt with informally." 

Wartell explained that, in the 



event harassment charges are seri- 
ous in naiure, "cases will t&gt;c handled 
by the Affirmative Action 
Committee, and the chancellor is the 
final adjudicator," 

"The basic issue is that the policy 
is there to protect anyone involved 
at tlic university," Wancll said. 

For more information about the 
IPFW mechanisms for dealing with 
issues of harassment, students 
should consult the student hand- 
book, which is distributed free of 
charge at the information office 
located in Kettler Hall.

Site chosen 

for child care 
facility at IPFW 



ByS. UrantKelley 
News Editor 

Plans are being made for a 
child care center lo serve parents 
who attend class at IPFW. 

During the IPSGA senate 
meeting on Sept. 26, Marian 
Zimmerman, dean of students, 
presented the child care program 
plans on behalf of the Child Care 
T^k Force. 

Zimmerman said the new cen- 
ter will be located on the comer 
of Hobson and Stellhom Roads 
on properly presently held by the 
State Developmental Center. 

I.U. President Miles Brand 
decided where to put the new 
center, Zimmerman said. 

Zimmerman said the new 
child care program would not be 
licensed by the slate; therefore, 
students will not be able to leave 
their children at the center for 
more than four hours per day. 

The child care center was 
located on the grounds of the 
future site during the late 1970s, 
When ihe child care center was 
closed down, the State 
Developmental Center look over 
the site and has housed its own 
faculty there ever since, accord- 
ing to Zimmerman. 

Space on the bottom floor of 
Walb Memorial Union has been 
considered for the proposed child 
care center, but Zimmerman said 
it was too small. "We felt that the 
space downstairs was simply not 
adequate." she said, 

A temporary child care facility 
near the Gates Sports Center was 
considered as an option at one 
time, Zimmerman explained. 
However, the cost to reclaim the 
former site for campus child care 



would be the cheaper option, 
"and parking around it is so 
much easier," she said. 

Students would not mind leav- 
ing their children across the 
street from IPFW since few com- 
plaints were received about the 
former facility, which was locat- 
ed at Parkview Memorial 
Hospital, Zimmerman said. 

Zimmerman gave several rea- 
sons that the new child caie pro- 
gram would not be licensed: 

• IPFW would have to hire 
full-time staff lo meel state 
guidelines for a licetued facilily; 

■ IPFW would have to provide 
hoi meals which would be 
required to meet slate guidelines; 
and, 

• IPFW would have lo provide 
a sort of educational session for 
the children who stay for more 
than four hours, in order lo meet 
slate guidelines. 

In short, everything which 
would go with Slate licensing 
would increase the cost of the 
facility for its users, said 
Zimmerman. "They cannot 
afford what it would cost," she 
said, 

Students will be allowed to 
leave their children at Ihe center 
for only four hours a day because 
it will remain unlicensed, 
Zimmerman said. Furthermore, 
die center would operate under a 
limit of 45 children at any lime. 

Zimmerman added thai the 
center could become licensed in 
the future if the School of 
Education's early childhood 
development program grows sig- 
niricantly. Students from the pro- 
gram would be able to work at 
the child care center for 
practicum work. 



Computer science 
gains recognition 



By Jamie Crave r 
SUfr Writer 

On Friday. Sept 16. die Purdue 
University Board of Trustees 
approved a proposed name change 
for IPFW's School of Engineering 
and Technology. 

The name is now the School of 
Engineering, Technology and 
Computer Science. George 
Kartsounes. dean of the school. 
wrote a t*o page request to Purdue 
requesting name recognition for 
what has become the school's 
"biggest program." 

"The name of the school no 
longer reflects the programs we 
now have, because computer sci- 



ence is not represented at all," 
explained Kartsounes. 

Kartsounes also said the name 
change was neccessary to foster 
both student and community 
awareness of the "scnxig computer 
science program" available ai 
IPFW, 

"People dealing with us need to 
know that we have computer sci- 
ence, and it is kind of awkward to 
try to sell the program when it is 
not even represented in our name," 
Kartsounes added. 

Kartsounes also said that an 
applied masters in compuier sci- 
ence is in the final stages of 
approval and may be okayed as 
soon as this ncek.

Staff Editorial 



SAD srands for Smclcni 
AcUvidcs Board; but, perhaps some 
of ihosc Mudcnis involved on the 
board have forgoilcn purpose of 
Iheirown organization. 

So far this semester SAB-spon- 
sorcd activities have been geared 
toward while students. Furtbcrmore, 
activities are frequently scheduled 
during a Ume when many students 
are attending class, or on Mondays 
a( noon, when virtually all student 
organizations hold dwir events. 

Il appears as if SAB has forgot- 
ten that even though IPFW is a 



commuter campus, minority slu- 
denis do in fact attend classes and 
make up pan of the student body. 

We are grateful that students are 
taking out their time lo participate 
in SAB. but thu fact remains they 
are not bringing us a diverse group 
of activities. 

What about students who are in 
their late twenties and early thirties, 
that is, the average IPFW student? 
Would a jazz ensemble be that dif- 
ricuU to bring to campus? In fact, 
don* t we have one of our own? 

Having some activities during 



the evenings as well as weekends 
might allow more students to attend 
activities. 

How about getting some input 
from the smdenls diemselves? 

Or is SAB going to behave like 
the rest of our student government 
and randomly make decisions with- 
out real student input? 

We are not bashing SAB. Instead 
we are politely suggesting that if 
SAB is going to spend students' 
money, then ibcy should bring 
entertainment for all students.

Letters to the Editor 



Hostility clouds student body 
president's decision making 



To (he editor, 

Our student body president. 

Mark ICing, must think the average 
IPFW student is financially inde- 
pendent, has lots of free time, and 
lives in Fort Wayne. These have lo 
be his assumptions to justify the 
"benefits" of replacing the weekly 
Campus Calendar in The 
Communicator. He suggests send- 
ing il via the mail, setting up a 
Campus Calendar phone line, and 
possibly the campus E-mail. 

The E-mail possibility is just 
that At present it's a closed systetn 
for faculty and administration and a 
few students with VAX accounts. 
That's not feasible now. 

The bulk monthly mailing idea 
to 12,000 students seems environ- 
mentally and financially very 
unfriendly to me. It will be a big 
waste of our natural resources and 
IPSGA funding for paper and 
postage. 



If the Campus Calendar is put on 
phone accessibility, how long is il 
going to take to listen to a month's 
worth of activities? If only the cur- 
rent week's activities are listed, 
those of us with busy lives won't 
have enough lead time to plan to 

"Please read the demograph- 
ics about the average IPf^ 

student. We are not rich. 

financially independent nor 

do we have time to kill. 

We have neither the time 

or money to 

implement or access yoiu- 

new Campus Calander 

schemes." 

attend an activity. 

Also, for those of us who live 
outside Fort Wayne, how much is 
this phone call going to COST? 
Since ihis is a commuter campus, 



you should provide cgual access for 
all studenLs and install an 800 mm)- 
ber to hear the Campus Calendar. 
How much will that cosl? 

Mr. King, your ideas for replac- 
ing the Campus Calendar in the stu- 
dent newspaper show flawed rea- 
soning. It's so easy lo pick up The 
Communicator and flip to the 
Campus Calendar. I bet it's a lot 
less expensive, too. 

Please read the demographics 
about the average IPFW student. 
We are not rich, Hnancially inde- 
pendent, nor do we have time to 
kill. We have neither the lime or 
money to implement or access your 
new Campus Calendar schemes, I 
suggest you release your hostility 
for the student newspaper in some 
other way that doesn't negatively 
affect the student body you serve.

Woodstock has become 
too commercialized 



To the editor, 

I was very disappointed when I 
read the feature entitled 
"Woodstock Revisited"in the 
August 25 issue of The 
Communicator. 

This may seem very unusual 
coming from a person who loves 
music as much as I do. 1 am very 
tired of people of my generation 
(X) having 'hang-ups' on the whole 
Woodstock thing. Sure, it was a 
very good idea for today's anisis to 
gather at one site. However, it is a 
shame that Woodstock was chosen 
at that site. How very novel! 
Woodstock was for the Baby 



Boomers — not for Generation X, 
Woodstock is the classic example 
of how people in my generation are 
basically unable to create a legacy 
of our own. 

The commercialization of 
Woodstock almost makes me 
vomit! The ticket prices alone 
(SI35) icU die story. But that is not 
all. Woodstock shirts and other 
assorted memorabilia are seen 
everywhere now. Money is now 
more imponanl than music; money 
seems now more important than art, 
than even creativity. That, if any- 
thing, will be the legacy of 
Generation X. 

For those reasons, 1 have person- 



ally decided to boycott all of the 
performers who were at Woodstock 
'94, even Bob Dylan, who disap- 
pointed me most. Luckily, most of 
my favorite bands were not al 
Woodstock — bands, such as. Pearl 
Jam. Soundgardcn, Smashing 
Pumpkins, Stone Temple Pilots 
and, yes, Alice in Chains ( a last 
minute withdrawal from the 
"Festival") and others. Perhaps, 
these artists realized what a farce 
Woodstock '94 really was. I hope 
diat others will come around to this 
point of view. 

Sincerely, 
Jamie Drake

To the editor. 

Regarding the child care head- 
line story in The Communicator on 
September 22, 1994: 

This student government, 
whether run by Suri or King, seems 
to "govern" a population having no 
connection or influence on me or 
my academic career. Student body 
president Mark King is not willing 
to saCTifice a gameroom "available 
to all students" to serve a minority 
composed of students with children. 

One year ago, fony-three per- 
cent of IPFW's student body was 
ages 26-50. with twenty-eight per- 
cent being 31-50. according to the 
Institutional Research department 



on campus. 

It seems illogical to conclude 
thai students with children are some 
negligible minority, but perhaps 
Mr. King is only president of the 
students he understands and associ- 
ates with. 

When I'm on campus. I don't 
have time to hang out and use \he 
gameroom. This is die room next to 
the Center for Women and 
Returning Adults, right? As to a 
lack of students with children in 
student government, perhaps none 
of us working student parents have 
time to be a student government 
member. Children take even more 
dme to nurmre than is necessary to 
maintain a competitive GPA. 



Of course, the irony is that cer- 
tain factions on campus want to 
defend the rights of the smoking 
minority at the expense of the 
majority of non-smokers. Only 
twenty-seven percent of the U.S. 
population as a whole smoke, 
according to "Statistical Abstracts 
of die United States." 

Why are the needs of a numeri- 
cally comparable minority of stu- 
dent parents deemed unimportant 
by Mark King, while the rights of 
the smoking minority on campus 
are regularly championed?

Douse needs to stop whining 



Poetry by Curtis Crisler 



To the editor, 

I am a prnud, while, male citizen 
of the United Siaici (Douse can 
nop reading now.) 1 do not find a 
special pride in being white or 
male. However, I do feel proud to 
be an American, Not an Angto- 
German-QicroVcc American, all of 
which I am comprised. Just 
American. 

My history is American history. 
It is where 1 am today. The wrongs 
of post "while folk" (a Douse quote) 
arc no&lt; things that I should be bcld 
accountable for. However, it seems 
that 1 am being held accountable for 
them, anyway. 

So rather than let my fellow 
brothers or sisters in humanity 
filumbic — sacrificing the fact that I 
am guilty of nothing but not doing 
Ibis sooner — I will admit to the 
wrongs that arc being held against 



me and apologize so thai my broth- 
ers and sisters might move on with 
their lives, and all repression will 
end. It seems that various writers 

"It's my fault that your 
country was so bad that 
you haiJ to come to this 
hellhole that I have creat- 
ed, I'm sorry that I only 
speak English. (Don't 
you go to college 
for free?)" 

for The Communicalor believe this. 

It's my fault that your own peo- 
ple sold you to me. It's my fault 
that your own people kill you and 
sell you drugs. All my fault. 

Il's my fault that J took your land 
and thai 1 forced you to become an 



alcoholic. 

I'm sorry that my moral stan- 
dards do not accept your sexual 
practices. It's my fault (hat you 
don't have the guts to openly and 
publicly stand for whatever you are. 
I'm sorry that you are embarrassed 
by what you arc. 

It's my fault that your country 
was so bad that you had to come to 
this hellhole that I have crcaied. I'm 
sorry that I only speak English. 
(Don't you go to college for free?) 

Do you think this apology 
worked? I don't, because my fellow- 
brothers and sisters realize thai if 
they accept this apology and get on 
with their lives they wiU no longer 
have a crutch to lean on. Then there 
would only be one thing to blame 
for their failure. Themselves. 
Reality is tough, hub Douse?

IPFW co-op program benefits all 



By Melwa Vnung 
Fealurei Writer 

ITs graduation day. You ate 
ready. The hair is perfect, cap and 
gown wrinkle free, and soon ihc 
diploma will be in your hand, bui 
Ihcn you realize you don'l have a 
job and fear ihai flipping burgers ai 
McDonalds is in the ne.ir and per- 
manenl fulurc. This scenario is 
more common ihan many of us 
might think, but some students 
have found a way to eliminate the 
McDonalds fear. 

"After graduation, one of the 
greatest dilemmas students face is 
how (0 land that extra special 
opportunity that will lead to fuinil- 
ing employment," said Diana 
Hcrgatt, associate director of 
Career Services and Cooperative 
Education. "Co-op students have 
the inside track to this predica- 
mcnL" 

Among the spring of 1994 grad- 
uates who participated in the pro- 
gram, over ninety percent found 
competitive jobs quickly "Within 
one month of graduation, ninety- 
one percent of IPFW's May 1994 
graduates landed outstanding car- 
rcr-rclated employment." Hcrgatt 
said/'Fofiy percent were hired per- 
manently by their co-op employers, 
and a another twenty percent were 
hired by coop employers who used 
the program in the past. 

Hcrgatt places students from 
three IPFW school's into full-lime, 
career-related positions during ihcir 



college education. Participants 
alternate a semester of school with 
a semester of full-lime, career- 
related employment. According to 
Hergati, students not only make 
competitive wages, but also gain 
valuable skills, and many even earn 
academic credit. "Co-op helps with 
career-making decisions," Hergatt 
said. "It allows students to lest 
classroom learning in the laborato- 
ry of the real world." 

Currently, the program serves 
approximately 102 students, but 
Hergatts plans to alter ihc number 
next month by adding new partici- 
pants, particularly minorities and 
studenLs with disabilities, "October 
has been designated as National 
Cooperative education month," 
Hergatt said. 

Hergatt has established several 
sessions to meet with Hispanos 
Unidos, DASEL, and the Black 
Collegian Caucus, but states that 
The Co-op Comer is the highlight 
of the month. The event will allow 
potential panicipants to meet cur- 
rent co-op students, explore co-op 
opportunities, meet a co-op 
employer and the new dean of EET, 
George Kartsounes. "This is the 
major event in celebration of 
National Cooperative Education 
month," Hergatt said. 

According to the fall 1994 
"Competitive Edge." the 
Cooperative Education Newsletter. 
approximately 900 colleges and 
universities nationwide support 
cooperative education, and co-op

students are employed by close to 
50.000 employers. " Several stud- 
ies have shown that co-op students 
are more likely to persist to gradua- 
tion. Studies show that at the lead- 
ing cooperative education institu- 
tions, approximately eighty percent 
of co-op students receive an offer 
for permanent employment from a 
company that participated in the 
institution's co-op program." 
Hergatt said.

Ry Paul Tupper 
Feptures Writer 

The Hotel, Restaurant, and 
Tourism Management Program, 
under the direction of Dr. John 
Knight, will be presenting their fall 
dinner seiics. According to Dr. 
Knight, the dinner series gives stu- 
dents in the program actual hands- 
on experience in managing and 
planning elegant meals for large 
groups of people in cooperation 
with business owners and man- 
agers. 

Dcing involved with the dinner 
series involves students rotating 
between writing and planning the 
menu, working as the event manag- 
er, the event host, cook and cus- 
tomer. "This gives the student a les- 
son in management, not just culi- 
nary arts", said Knight. 

The dinners, which will be 
served to the dining public, offer 
excellent cuisine and wine tasting at 
most events. At each event, heart 
healthy or vegetarian meals are 
available by request at the time of 
ticket purchase. 

The pria\s for each dinner ranges 



from fifeteen to thirty-five dollars, 
or a season ticket for every event 
can be purchased for S200, which 
offers a savings of forty dollars. For 
more information, telephone 481- 
6562. 

The students of the program, 
along with Novus International 
Travel Academy, will also be host- 
ing an extended four-day weekend 
trip to Las Vegas. Departure is set 
for Thursday, Oct, 6, from 
Indianapolis. The return flight will 
leave for Indianapolis lale evening, 
Sunday, Oct, 9. 

During the stay, a side trip has 
been planned to the University of 
Nevada, Las Vegas Hotel School 
for all who are iniersted This will 
include casino classrooms and a 
facility featuring restaurant and 



hotel rooms. Tours of such mega- 
botels as Ceasars Palace, MGM

University Women: 

Real life: trials and tribulations 



University women i^ a new 
leries Uul will rcalurc ibe difrcrent 
stories and lives of women here on 
ibc IPFW campus. TTic purpose of 
ihLs Mmes is nut jusi (o inform or 
10 cnicrtain but lo open om minds 
lo the real life struggles of women 
today. 

Our first prorilc is Joni Queen. 
Some of you may be familiar with 
her as your teacher, but did you 
Icnow bow she has come to be in 
Uiat position? Or how difncult her 
jouiney has been? 

At age 16. Queen dropped out 
of high school and got married. 
Shordy after die maniagc Queen 
bore two children. However living 
"happily ever after" never hap- 
pened for Queen. 

When she was 17 years old her 
first bom child died. Then two 
years later her second child died as 
well. 

Just when Ibe worst was over, 
Queen fell into deep depression. 
And after a few years she and hus- 
band Mark divorced. 

For the next several years 
Queen farmed as a way to cope 
with some of the pain and anguish. 

"1 grew out of it," commented 
Queen, And so she moved back to 
Fori Wayne to pursue her GED. 

Queen succeeded well in earn- 
ing her GED degree and was 
encouraged to continue her educa- 
tion at IPFW. 

She took die advice and has not

regretted it at all. 

Her first malb class at IPFW 
was MA153. "I enjoyed it so 
much, 1 started having study 
groups right away." Queen said. 

Queen's success in the class 
was well known. She started help- 
ing others in the class and then 
began to tutor in the Women's 
Center and Transitional Studies, all 
as a Iresbaman, 

"This has been such a learning 
experience in the classroom," com- 
mented Queen. 

Queen went on to earn her 
bachelor's degree to teach mathe- 
matics. 



Domini(jtie llouge i 



Not only is Queen a mathemat- 
ics teacher here at IPFW. she also 
is a volunteer tutor at CooperTeen 
and Arbors of Fon Wayne. 

And to make her life more com- 
plete, she has recently remarried 
her first and only husband, Mark. 

When asked what to tell other 
women who have suffered form 
personal tragedy she responded, 
"Eton'l give up."

lU geology professor probes ocean floor 



by S. Branl Kelley 
News Fdiror 

An Indiana University geology 
professor rcccnily accompanied a 
mulll-natlonal expedition to Ihe 
boilom of \ltc ocean floor lo drill 
between two tectonic plates In the 
second cxpctlitJon o{ Its kind. 

lU professor Andrew Fisher 
went aboul 150 miles wesi of the 
Bahamas Ihls summer lo drill 
several holes In the ocean floor 
between the North American and 
Caribbean tectonic plates. 

The group of scientists on the 
expedition placed sensors, or 
recording devices. In two of the 
holes. A soil sampler was also 



placed in one of the holes. This Is 
only the second tinie holes have 
been drilled between two plates, 
and the first lime sensors were 
placed there. 

Nine or ten holes were drilled 
aboul 1500 feet into the ocean 
floor, said Fisher. Sensors were 
placed into two of the holes. The 
ocean depth at the placement site 
Is aboul 5500 meters. 

The sensors record tempera- 
ture, pressure, and one also .sam- 
ples fluid found between the 
plates. About 20 sensors arc 
placed in one hole and ten in the 
other. 

The holes were covered after 
the sensors were placed into ihcm 



so the sea water would not inter- 
fere with the sensors' readings of 
data. The sensors themselves 
were suspended from the rims of 
their holes by cables, he said. 

Fisher said the sensors will 
record data for a couple of years. 
Readings are taken once an hour. 
They perform no analysis on the 
data or the samples: they are "just 
dumb recorders," he said. 

Readings of pressure and tem- 



perature will be retrieved by an 
electronic cable or by manually 
removing the recording medium 
from the sensor. The fluid sam- 
ples will need to be taken from 
the samplers manually. 

Fisher said he became interest- 
ed in the plaie boundary between 
the North American and 
Caribbean plates because the fault 
line between the two plates shows 
relatively little activity. A fault 



Secrets Beneath 
the Sea 



line will usually show a signin- 
cant amount of earthquake activi- 
ty- 

Fisher wants to study the com- 
position and floor movement of 
the area to Hnd out why the area 
shows little earthquake activity. 
The Caribbean tectonic plate Is 
moving at normal speed, or aboul 
six centimeters per year, over the 
North American plate. 

He was able to go on the expe- 
dition because his expertise was 
in operating some of the equip- 
ment used in this particular voy- 
age. 

Fisher said he and his col- 
leagues won'l know If the data 
recording was successful or not 



for another year until they icltim 
to the site for data and sample 
retrieval. 

Rsher was successful in mea- 
suring of permeability of the rock 
in and around the fault. TWo pre- 
vious attempts to measure rock 
permeability in a fault had been 
unsuccessful, he said. This Icsl 
was successful and yielded results 
close to predictions.

Understanding 

plate 

tectonics 

By S, Branl Kelley 
News Editor 
Undei^ianding what Fisher and 
his colleagues did at the boiiom 
of Utt ijcean is impossible without 
a basic knowledge of plate tecton- 
ics. 

Dipak Chowdury, professor of 
geosciences at IPFW. said, "The 
uppermost layer of the eaith is 
broken into a number of plates, 
and Ihese plates move with 
respect to one another." 

When one tectonic plate moves 
over or beneath another, the 
resulting friction eventually pro- 
duces an earthquake. 

Plate movement is produced by 
[ock migrating from the earth's 
core toward the crust. As rock 
moves toward the surface, materi- 
al on the surface, which forms Ihe 
crust, is moved out of the way. 

Often, the hot rock will pene- 
trate the crust and form a volcano. 
This son of penetration accounts 
for the ridge of underwater moun- 
tains found in the middle of the 
Atlantic Ocean, 

When plates are moved, one 
will oflen be pushed underneath 
another in a process called sub- 
liuction. Typically, a tectonic plate 
will move at about the rate of Hn- 
gemail growth, or six centimelers 
per year. 

Plate movement also accounts 
for mountains. When one plate 
subducts another, fragniients of the 
plate are pushed upward. When 
fragments of a plate are pushed 
upward on land, a mountain

Soccer coach says 
team won't give up 



By Eric Butler 
Sporb Editor 

The IPFW men's soccer team 
played iwo games this past week- 
end, and both games ended in 
complete disappointmenl. 

The IPFW men's soccer team 
is struggling this year lo fmd con- 
sistency in tbcir play. The team's 
overall record is 2-5. and their 
Great LaJtcs Valley Conference 
record is 0-2, 

Coach Troy Rushing points to 
a lack of experience as being one 
of the problems. An abundance of 
first year players could be a rea- 
son for the teams lack of execu- 
tion. 

In IPFW's loss lo Kentucky 
Wcsleyan last Saturday, Rushing 
said be believes that his team 
actually outplayed their opponent, 
but three huge defensive mental 
lapses resulted in defeat. The 
teams second game last weekend 
against St. Joseph's turned out 
much the same way. According 
to Rushing, IPFW dominated the 
entire game, but ended up losing 
because of poor officiating and an 
overly aRErcssivc St. Joseph 
squad. 

Rushing said (hat the goals 
scored against IPFW were a result 



of Sl Joseph forwards knocking 
down the defensemen of IPFW. 
Sl Josqih racked up a total of 33 
fouls compared to a much cleaner 
seven by IPFW. 

This past weekend IPFW look 
on Northeast Missouri Sute, a 
powerful Division II midwest 
team. IPFW played a strong 
game, but lost 0-1 in double over- 
time. Back-up goaltendcr. Matt 
Scbmitz played like a possessed 
madman in the near upset. He 
blocked one shy of everything that 
was launched against him. 

Although Rushing cited many 
problem areas on this year's 
squad, he has nothing but praise 
for bis seniors. Ryan Hays. Erich 
Rommel, and James Ewing arc a 
few of the seniors who have pro- 
vided the leadership for this year's 
team. Rushing says the team will 
try (0 improve with each remain- 
ing game. He makes it clear that 
this year's team is noi giving up 
yet 

On Sunday. Oct 2. IPFW wUI 
host the game against a much 
improved lUPUI team that tied 
Oakland last week. Oakland went 
lo the national Finals last year. It 
should definitely be an exciting 
match. 



Schmitz's spectatular play impresses super Dave 



Super Dive'i (J+-A 

Dear Super Dave: 

Q: Wbit is Ibe future of major 
league baMb&amp;117 

-ivid t&gt;ueball fai&gt;- 

Dcaravid: 

Ar Being the "avid" fan ihal you 
lie, my advice to you is this. Le\ this 
season be a premonition. It's over 
nua Baseballs future is looking aloi 
like OJ.'s, Not very good. Very few 
fans care about the game like Ihey 
used to. Football is lovin it. It's a rat- 
ings thing. Footballs hoi; Baseballs 



Dear Super Dave: 

Q: What do you think about Deion 
Sanders sighning with the 49'efs7 

■49er fan- 
Dear 49cr fan: 

A: I think it's a great move! Doth 
Ibe 49er's and Delon are benefiting 
from the deal. Deion might noi be 
malcing as much money, but be gets 
to play for a real Super Bowl con- 
tender. He's a good player on a very 
good team now. Unlike before when 
he was a superstar player on a 
mediocre team. 

Dear Super Dave: 

Q; Who will win the Heisman tro- 
phy this year? 

-IPFW student. 
Dear studcm; 

A: That was an easy question until 
Tyrone Wheatly (Michigan) got hurt. 



Now it"j hard lo say. My oiher 
Heisman hopeful «tiuld be Powlu* of 
N.D. Tberes a few things, however, 
thai will hold him back. One, he's too 
young. He's twund to make alot of 
mistakes. Two, I tttink he's overrated. 
Yeah he's good, but he's no Montana 
like he was billed to be. Its early in 
ihe season Ihougb. and right now 
iheies no clear favorite. I did hear 
about 3 diamond in the rough, a long- 
shot pick who plays for Alcorn State. 
His name ii Steve Mcnair. He has 
been averaging over 577 yards a 
game. So watch for him, also. 

I&gt;ear Super Dave: 

Q: Did you hear about SchmitzT 
-IPFW siudent- 

Dcar SchmitzFan: 

Who the bell hasn'lM!!! This man 
is a God, For those who still lead a 
secluded life and haven't heard of 
him; he is the second, should be fir^l, 
siring goalie for the IPFW men's 
soccer team. This man was nothing 
less than a brick wall against a power- 
ful Northeast Missouri State this past 
weekend. Seven, yes count them 
seven, spinclingling saves against a 
high-powered offensive onslaught. 
When pressure mounted most 



Footbag fad 'hooks' student 



By: EricBuller 
Sports Editor 

The hacky sack syndrome has 
stm-ted. Evcryiime I turn around 
nowadays. I run into a "hacky-cir- 
clc." These circles can be sized 
anywhere from two to 25 and have 
become commonplace on school- 
yards, campuses and sidewalks 
evoywhcrc. Because of the grow- 
ing popularity of the "footbag," 1 
have decided to explore this new 
fad. 

First olT, you're going to need 
feel to play. The object is to keep 
the footbag off the ground using 
your lower body. Once the five 
basic kicks arc learned, a whole 
series of games becomes possible. 

I asked Nikki Sawyer, a fresh- 
man at IPFW this year and hacky 
enihusia.sl, how long it took her to 
become modcraiely skilled in 
kicking the footbag, "Aflcr a few 
tears and a lot of repitition, you 
start 10 get the hang of it." she 
said. 

Hacky sack is a full-fledged 
sport which demands the same 
kind of discipline and practice 



associated with any ball or racket 
game. I asked Jeff Mosely, part- 
time student at IPFW, why hacky 
sack was the sport for him. "It was 
hard at first, but once I got the 
hang of it. I got hooked, I think it's 
the challenge that I like mosC he 
said. 



Hacky sack is even document- 
ed in the Guincss Book of World 
Records. Ted Manin of Parkridgc. 
IL. set a 1989 record by kicking a 
footbag 48,825 limes consecutive- 
ly. For eight hours, II minutes 
and 25 seconds, he never let the 
bag touch the ground.

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. What's ihe point of 
HIV testing? If you've 
got HIV, you're going to 
die "before your time," 
and why would anyone 
want to know that? 

A. Medicines are now 
available that can prolong 
the period of good health 
and prevent illness in 
people With HIV, Better 
treatments and possibly a 
cure may be found before 
those now infected get sick 
or die. Also, if you are 
infected, you must take 
precautions not to infect 
others.
