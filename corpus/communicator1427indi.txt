5 'Waste of lime, 

§■ By law. males born aflcr Jan. 1, 1960 
^ must register tor thedrafl, but there are 
^ those who don't for personal reasons. 
^ Individual feelings, especially 
N thoughtful, educated reasons against 
t war or the draft should not affect how 
&gt;; much aid a student gets to continue his 
5; higher education. It's a shame minds 
^ will be wasted because of this. 

5 The law discriminates against males 
^ since females aren't required lo 
^ register. Will only females be educated? 
■; According lo the Indiana Daily 
5 Student (IDSI, the regulations would 
^ require universities to collect from each 
^^^llldenl an acknowledgement leiler from 

Ihe Selective Service or an affidavit 
slating he has not received an 



aclinowledgement letler or an 
explanation why he did not register. 
Universities could spend Iheir lime 
doing more conslruclive things than 
making sure males are registered, 
especially when the Selective Service 
has estimated up to 97 percent of those 
required lo register have done so. Why 
waste lime on such a small amount of 
Students? 

In a letter lo the Department of 
Education, Ed Sample, director of the 
University Office of Scholarships and 
Financial Aids at lU, said, "To embroil 
thousands of institutions al their own 
and considerable expense in Ihe en- 
forcement of Selective Service 
registration requirements lo identify the 
very small numl&gt;er of students who have 
not registered with Selective Service 
seems totally out of proportion."

Students' Government members serve 
as liasons between the students and the 
adininistralion. They schedule speeches, 
performances and other programs. They 
decide how students' activity fee money 
should be spent. They are important. 

We applaud everyone who decided to 
run for student body president, vice 
president, SUBOG chairperson, senator 
or SUBOG member. It shows they want 
lo get involved.

I Congrzitulations coach 



We would like to take this opportunity 
to congratulale IPFW volleyball coach 
Arnie Ball on his selection as the men's 
coach of the north squad for the 1983 
National Sports Festival. 

It isn't everyday a local coach 
receives national attention in any sport, 
much less volleyball. Ball's selection 
should help lo add credibility to the 






IPFW athletic program, 
Ball in recruiting. 

Volleyball isn't Ihe most popular sport 
at IPFW or in Fort Wayne. The local 
high schools don't have a varsity 
program for boys, yet Ball has worked 
hard in developing a strong program at 
IPFW with a numtjer of local players on 
both the men's and women's squads.
