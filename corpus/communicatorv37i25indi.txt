# April Fool's Day! Did 

you know that the day is celebrat- 
ed because of the switch from 
the Julian Calendar to the modern 
Gregorian Calendar? According 
to infoplease.com, many people 
either refused to accept the new 
date (of the new year on the Gre- 
gorian calendar), or did not learn 
about it and continued to cel- 
ebrate New Year's Day on April 
1 . Other people began to make 
fun of these traditionalists, send- 
ing them on "fool's errands" or 
trying to trick them into believing 
something false. 



* On this day in 1792, 
Congress authorized the first U.S. 
Mint in Philadelphia. 

* On this day in 1870, 
Victoria Claflin Woodhull an- 
nounced her candidacy for presi- 
dent of the United States. 

* On this day in 1917. 
President Woodrow Wilson asked 
Congress to declare war against 
Germany. 



* On this day in 1882, 
outlaw Jesse James was shot in 
the back by Bob Ford, one of his 
own gang members, reportedly 
for a $10,000 reward. 

* On this day in 1936, 
Bruno Hauptmann was electro- 
cuted for the kidnapping and

Depressed? Stressed? 
IPFW programs can help 



By Stephanie Samples 
Chief Reporter 



Many college students fan.- prob- 
lems every day. In the strain of pur- 
suing an education, students are not 

At IPFW there are personal coun- 
seling services available to students 
who may have any kind of mental 
health need. 

"In general. I see people for de- 
pression, anxiety. 1 1 also seel students 
who are having trouble coping and 
adjust pi iii to student hie The changes 
between rural to urban environments, 
and even change from tropical en- 
vironments in Midwest ean be very 
hard on a student," said licensed clin- 
ieal social worker Donald F. Smith. 

Smith has worked for the person- 
al counseling services at IPFW for 12 
years and practiced social work for 
33 years. 

Many college students will at 
some point go through some kind of 
depres-ion or anxiety, hut when does 
a small issue tum into a problem? 

"Before I see someone, I need 
to know what the student's general 
health is from the regular medical 
doctor. I need to know this informa- 
tion because many limes symptoms 
lor depression can go hand-in-hand 
with other medical problems, such as 
diabetes," said Smith. 

Smith is aware of why students 
may feci uncomfortable seeking 
help through counseling. "There is a 
stigma in seeking out help, but I have 
seen many students who are very so- 
phisticated; the\ seek therapy and are 
not intimidated. 

"In the U.S., we are thought of as 
being independent people, and not in 
need of help. It is as if people expect 
others in be superman or superwom- 



an. but to acknowledge that there is a 
problem is very strong," said Smith. 

While some students may feel un- 
easy about therapy, others lake it very 
seriously. 

"Young people 1 sec are open to 
gelling help; they will work their guts 
to fix their situation. An important 
part is trust. When students come to 
me for help it means (hey trust me." 
said Smith. 

Trust is one of the most impor- 
tant components of seeking therapy. 
When students go through personal 
counseling they are given confiden- 
tiality agreements that remain confi- 
dential unless a dangerous situation 



Other i n stance ■ would be it a student 
was planning on harming someone 
or committing a crime on campus, it 
would be my responsibility to contact 
the police," said Smith. 

Ouside of those situations. Smith 
and the other personal counselors will 
keep all iiiloriii.nioii private, "If I sec 
a student on campus. 1 am not going 
to ask them how they are. 

I do not do this to be ntde, bui 
because I do not want to embarrass 
anyone. If the student speaks lo me, 
I would be more than happy to speak 
with them." said Smith.

Renovations force 
musical chairs' 



By Louisa Danielson 



The IPFW department of music is 
gelling re,,dy for the lug move to its 
\\&lt;\\ building in May. Several other 
dcpanmeiils will also he moving, ei- 
ther in full or in part. 

Classroom Medical is getting a 
major shake up as its basement will 
be cleared, then renovated and hllcd 
again with the philosophy and wom- 
en's studies departments, and some- 
English offices. 

This move will free up room on 
the second lloor of CM for the his- 
tory, political science, sociology, and 
miernaiional languages and culture 
studies departments to expand. 

Health sciences will take the va- 
cant space in Nell Nail created by Ihe 
pliilnso|&gt;h&gt; department's move. 

"We're doing this to improve 
university opportunities." said Mare 
Lipman, Dean of Arts and Sciences. 
"I ile will be better after the move." 

He cited the space crunch that 
many of Ihe* departments have. For 
example, only full-lime faculty have 
space to meet with students privately. 
Also, several offices for the interna- 
tional languages and culture stud- 
ies department have more than one 
instructor sharing the same office 
space With the departmental moves, 
the university hopes lo relieve some 
of the of lice crowding, if not all. 

Departments began making plans 
to move the instant procedures were 
finalized for the new music building. 
Lipman mentioned that it is a cooper- 
ative effort to identify the needs and 
desires of people working at IPFW. 

The exact strategy for moving the 
departments origin. iled in the Office 
of the Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs, then was sent to Lipman's of- 
liee. where he has been working with 



the various departments to determine 
which department goes where. "He 
(Lipman) is the one who has to do 
the divvying up." said Smart Wythe, 
chair of the English and linguistics 
department, "(And he's) very good 
about saying what the priorities are," 

Music faculty will he moving out 
of CM at the end of the semester. As 
soon as they leave, renovations will 
begin on lite vacated basement. All 
practice modules will be removed 
and the area will be turned into 
classrooms. The large music studios 
will be turned into smaller offices. 
Rooms !36 and 138 will be lom 
down to create one large classroom. 
Room 158. next lo the student lobby, 
will be made inlo student space, pos- 
sibly with vending machines, new 
furniture and room for CM's Wi-Fi 
system. 

"We're trying very hard lo not 
spend too much money doing this," 
commented Lipman. 

According to Walt Hranson. vice 
chancellor ol financial affairs, build- 
ing n 



$200,000. "We tried lo r

Repairs to the outside oft helm ild- 
mg will also be completed, including 

tuek-poniiing ,uid joint re-caulking. 

renovation should be completed by 
early July. According to schedule, ihe 
music faculty should be moved inlo 
their new building by July 25 and the 
phplosnphv department will be in its 
new rooms by August I . 

"We're not moving people once 
classes start," assured Lipman. 

Some construction will be done 
after Ihe semester begins - the 1600- 
scai auditorium of ihe new music 
building isn't slaled to open until 
September.

By Louisa Danielson 

They've go! rhythm, ihey'vc got

Ihc IPFW campus is scheduled lo 
open by the beginning of the Full 
2007 semester, 

The music building entrance will 
fcaiurc a circular drive and wide win- 
dows in the front. The west wing will 
be filled with a 1.650-scat audito- 
rium; the east wing will be devoted In 
academic rooms. 

Very few walls ol the building are 
exactly straight - most have a 2-dc- 
grec slant thai deflect sound upward 
into ceiling tiles. Practice rooms arc 
se! on floating slabs separated from 
the main slab of the building by a 
layer of caulk. 

Nine layers of dry wall separate 
the practice rooms Iruiu the hallways. 
To prevent vibrations throughout Mr- 
building, utility pipes (like water and 
air pipes) are hung from springs in 
the ceiling

the walls of the auditoriums. 

The building will hold 22 prac- 
tice rooms, two specialized practice 
rooms (l hor.il .Hid iiiviruincnl.il), two 
auditoriums, a music library, two 
docks, two star dressing rooms (with 
private baths and showers), a gang

Choir and UNITY. Upstairs studios 
will hold pianos, including two grand 
pianos in each ol the main piano stu- 

Windows line the walls on both 
floors, flooding the siudios and 
practice rooms with light. The paint 

scheme of the interior is peach, yel- 
low and taupe, matching the cheerful 
lighi scheme. The windows are made 
of low-e glass, which screens out 70 
percent o I radiation. 

Special features in some of the 
classrooms will include the Crestron 
technology system, which links the 
computer, sound system, projector 
and VCR/DVD into one desk with 
a flip-up touch-pad screen. The mu- 
sic education room will have Inkling 
chairs , hkI desks that can be removed 
to allow for demonstrations. 

The 250-scat auditorium will 



have an ll-seat hjkony overlooking 
the stage. Once the main auditorium 
is completed, it will be the third-larg- 
est venue in Fort Wayne, aside from 
tin' f.mhassy Theatre and the Scottish 
Rite. 

The large IPFW auditorium will 
have a convertible stage with scissor 
lifts and an orchestra pit. The stage 
will be large enough to hold the en- 
tire Fort Wayne Philharmonic when 
the moveable pit/floor is raised Hush 
with the rest of the stage.

panel monitors will be suspended 
outside the auditorium so that people 
can sec what is going on inside if 
there isn't enough room within the 
auditorium. The iwo auditoriums will

An insecure future for safety 



A Sample 

of What I Think 

By Stephanie Samples 



Over Spring Break I spent my 
time in Long Beach, California. My 
boyfriend John and I went together 
and it was a wonderful trip. 1 was 
sure that I would write about some- 
thing that happened while in Cali- 
fornia. While there is plenty I could 
say, that is not what 1 am going to 

While in the Los Angeles airport 
John made a comment about the 
safely in the airport. He was pointing 
out how we were probably safer Ihere 
than most places, because everyone 
who was in the restaurant with us had 
lo go through metal detectors, have 
their bags checked and even remove 
(heir shoes to make sure they were 
not carrying anything dangerous. 

After John made his comment, 
I began to appreciate the annoying 
process of entering an airport. Al- 
though 1 realize that some people 
may find ways to get past the secu- 
rity process, most won't. This made 
me think. How sad is u that in order 
to feel completely safe in a public 
place today, you have to know lhat 
everyone has literally been checked'.' 
Is this our future? 

I know that my old high school 
now has metal detectors, and dogs 
lo search for drugs. I find it sad lhat 
students hcuvcen the ages of 14 lo 



feel safe in school. What this is just passing the buck. The fact 
lat a video game is being used to 
love blame away from the criminal 
; ridiculous. I am saying that these 
/pes of entertainment do nol affect 
outlooks on certain types of behav- 
)r; a video game docs not put a gun 
i the hands of the viewers. In this 
rjuntry wc have the power of choice, 
take responsibility 



is next, metal detectors outside art 
class before ihe kindergarlners linger 
paint? 

This trend is not just in schools. 
Shopping areas, parking lots and all 
public places are not considered com- 
pletely safe. I know that in the past 
there have always been criminals and 
that bad things have always unex- and many do no

Steven Seagal sparks 
up an energy drink 



By Said El-Dajani 
Managing Editor 



Some guys get their adrenaline 
pumping by watching sports, shoot- 
ing a gun or watching Steven Seagal 
movies jusl like Joe Swanson in 'The 
Family Guy," The rest drink eilhcr 
coffee it the new beverage of choice 
-Ihe energy drink. Usually Idled wilh 
stiperlluous amounts of taurine, the 
energy drink of this week combines 
oilier questionable elements, includ- 
ing cordyceps (which sounds like a 
fake muscle), guarana tguava') and 
my favorite, goji berry. 

Steve Seagal's Lightning Bolt 
comes in two flavors: Cherry Charge 
and Asian Experience. Personally. 
both sound like feelings I want to 
avoid. I decided to sample these two 
drinks to see their energy level po- 
tency and of course, their taste. 

While Cherry Charge resembles 
watered-down cherry Coke, the fla- 
vor is not too bad. It doesn't sting, 
yei ildoesn't bile. However, when it 
comes down to it. the cherry doesn't 
charge me ai all. In taei. after drink- 
ing tins "elixir." I quickly fell tired 
,ui-.\ unappreciated Who would have 
known lhat a energy drink could have 
side effects? 

Asian Experience sounds exactly 
as it tastes- a conflict between the 
taste buds and the intestinal track. 
Not only does ihis drink ruin an Asian 
experience, hut I'm thankful that I've 



experienced Asia before I drank it. 
False advertising my friends. 

When it comes down lo Seagal's 
I ighlning Boll, ihe only thing n has 
going for it i 



:. Thee 



■e.uls. 



.then 






Don't be discouraged here. ' write 
these reviews nol lo change your 
mind, but to keep you aware of the 
products lhat hit the shelves, which, 
as far as my research is concerned, is 
only at Wal-Mart. 

So, look for the black can with 
a small Sleven .Seagal head on the 
bottom This can is poorly designed 
and not very well thought-out. It was 
probahly the lirst concept made and 
Sieve was probably too busy making 
slraight-lo-DVD movies at the time. 
What I do like is the font choice. If 
Steven Seagal spoke in any format, it 
would be all capitals.

Fifth grade gameshow gives education a new grade 



Pardon the Pun 

By Michelle Yahne 



I am smarter than a fifth grader, 
bill T do no! think that the kids in the 
hit tv show arc fifth graders at all. This 
new television game show, "Arc You 
Smarter Than a Fifth Grader", hosted 
by none other than "he might be Jell 
Foxworthy", is a new show where it 
lesfs adults again-.l lif'lli graders and 
their own knowledge. 

On this particular episode, even 
though I tou Id nni siand this woman, 
she had did what 1 ihink was the stu- 
pid wuy of answering questions - try- 
ing; the hard ones first. Why not start 
with the easy ones and work your 
way up? Then stop when they get loo 
hard or you run out ol the lifelines. 



how many other people would tesi 
their intelligence against a fifth grad- 
er and be confident. Don't get me 
wrong, some of those questions are 
difficult, but most arc typical com- 
mon knowledge questions. 

I understand lhat you are under 
tons of pressure and studio lights, 
with a little brain power and .1 detent 
thought process but, one can surely 
get through most of these questions, 
especially when they're basically la- 
beled from easy to bard, and the con-

Well, regardless of her 
idea, she got lo the half of .1 n 
dollars question. Now, when 
thing angers me on 
screen. I don't normally yell, but her 
question was "What continent is also 
a country?" 

Now. this lady contestant did two 
things wrong. Firstly, she did no! 
even attempt to use her last lifeline, 
which made rue angry And secondly, 
she didn't know the answer! "Auslra- 
lia, lady! Australia!" came out of my 
mouth more than once (if I can re- 
call correcllyl. 1 mean, come on now. 
who doesn't know that? 

Even though she got lo Ihe sec- 
ond toihe last question, I don't think 
she deserves the money at all. 

Well, maybe she does, because 



Well. 1 am trying to be the only 
person who has no! been on a reality 
or game show. That is if they keep 
coming up Willi more ol those shows, 
hecjuselhey've got to be running out 
ot p.iriictpanls by now. 

Finally, back to the lifth grad- 
ers. America has been getting a Itlilc 
lax on education and things, but I 
never realized ihe problem was this 
catastrophic. We're currently mak- 
ing television shows ilia! reflect our

I could say a lot of things, but I'll 
let you come to your own decision 
on thai one. Well... maybe I'll give 
you a few. Il says thai even though 
we essentially have some of the best 
education, we cannot, or will no! be 
receplive to it. We have more peo- 
ple enrolled in colleges around the 
country than ever before, and while

I wish lhat I could be a career

Stunting developing ideas in a conservative school 



There has been a fuss lately sur- 
rounding the Woodlun High School 
student. Megan Chase, who wrote an 
opinions piece lor the school news- 
paper concerning homosexuality 
Unfortunately, tins story was never 
allowed to be published in the student 
paper. Bui. I am sure that nearly all

lacked "balance and thoroughness " 
1 am not sure where this person 
came up with the requirements tor an

quite annoying.

New movies bring back 
memories 



Spring is a lime for all things new. 
except for Teenage Mutant Ninj.i

things so much that twice is nice. 



Bui it 



; like people in the 



movie business have just 
ideas and are recycling everything. I 
i on I J pros ide a plethora of examples, 
but let's just stick with two. 

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" 
looks ridiculous. Excuse me. make 
that "TMNT." Did they really think 
that by just using the initials and 
duelling ihe men drc--cd like turtles 
thai they were creating a whole new 
idea ' 1 don't know how many of you

I'll admit I loved the turtles when 
I was young I had the pi/za -hoot- 
ing van and action figures. I prayed 
for a yellow jumpsuit for Christmas 
so thai I could play the part ol April 
when my broihcruiid his friends were 
prcie riding lo light crime. But how 
long ago was that? I'm not a 6-year- 
old boy today, so I don't know how 
much of a crowd iln- lad i- gathering 
ibis time around, bin u can't be as big 
as it was 15 years ago. Most of the 



people in the theater will probably be 
boys my age who want lo reminisce 
(They are probably single and live in 
their parent's basements.) 

right now. Now there's a movie that 
I could never tire of, unless it some- 
how sucks. The first three in the se- 
ries were fantastic. They had a good 
plot, good action, and people of all 
ages could enjoy them. It does bother 
me though that whoever was mak- 
ing movies thought, "Well, I'm out 
ol good ideas, so lei's go back years 
and years and see if any of those ac- 
tors want to remake another one of 
the hits." But, they did, and I have to 
admil that I will go see this one. 

I suppose all I really want is a good 
movie that wasn't previously made 
with the exact same plot. Even if I re- 
ally enjoyed a film, I only want to see 
it with one set of actors. Maybe the 
producers are sticking with a classic 
rather than trying a radical new idea 
that may flop. Old or new, I just ask 
that it's good. 

For those of you who have been 
wailing in anticipation for "TMNT," 
enjoy yourselves. There's a new plot, 
new actors (or new compuler-ani- 
m.iled aciorsi and new action. I hope 
lhal you feel the same rush of excite- 
ment that you fell years ago. 



Your vs/aist watches moire than calories

Almost every day 1 hear or read 
a story on healthy eaiing and how 
Americans need to practice more of 
it. On the same day I see commer- 
cials, signs and other advertisements 
for cheap food that isn't so healthy. 

Many college siudenis experience 
ihe somewhat tragic freshmen fifteen 
due to the intake of these foods. Not 
only do many people choose lo eat 
these foods because of the cheap 
prices, they choose them because 
they arc quick and easy. Luckily, on 
campus we have some healthier op- 
tions. Diel on campus is not perfect, 
but at least we have more options 
than the dollar menu. 

Seeing all these commercials can 
be lempting. unless you really think 
about what you are eating. Even the 
best options should not really even 
be considered healthy. I did a little

Type O Negative: back from the dead with 'Dead Again' 



Type Negative is a band that 
spurs fear in the hearts of children all 
over the world. Maybe that's an ex- 
aggeration, but not much of one. 

Fronted by Peter Steele, a 6'7" 
hulk who plays an upright bass us- 
ing a chain as a shoulder strap, this 
band's image and sound conveys 
dreariness io the delight of outcasts 
everywhere. 

But it almost came to an end two 
years ago when Ihe band's oftieial 
website po-ied an image of a tomb- 
stone with an inscription reading: 
Peter Steele 1962-2005. Fans lit up 
message boards trying lo Itndoul any 



information (hey could (myself in- 
cluded), and official comments from 
the band were nowhere to be found.
