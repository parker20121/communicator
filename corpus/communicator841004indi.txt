chairman of the communication nnd theater deparlmenl, said It does. 

"The nature of Ihe injlruellon and the nature o( Ihe activity delermines whether

by the prisence of speciallied equipment mipeclaltied space " McCants said that

"Icanlcach this course wilh out the use c&lt; typewriters In Ihectassroom," Florea 
said, and McCants agreed, ButMcCantsstUl believes that iheclass Is a lobcnirse, 
and ihercfoTB docs not think that the students have been unjustly made lo pay the 
128 fee. 

"I guess I thlnlilt's(alr,"saldMcCanls. "The fact that the faculty has said that 
this course is such that the struchire determines II lo be a lab course jusliHes the 
shidentshovlng topay a tab fee." 

McCanlssaid, however, that he cannot justify Ihe fee on Ihebaslscflheexpense 
that IPFW has incurred (or o(ferlng the class. "We provide handouts. Thai Is the 
only material we provide." 

The department provides handouts toany class which requests them, regardless 
o( wl^lher It isa laboratory cnirae Andsofor, Florea has nol tnade that request 



Grote believes that lab fees were originally assessed on Ihcbaslsofn class's use 
ot consumable supplies when the use of those supplies represented an extra- 
ordinary e.iperue to the university. And In his view, the definition has been ex- 
panded upon to Includclhe use of any equipment, extra rooms or additloiuil In- 
sliuctors newled. 

IPFW does not seem to have a written definition of the word "lab" m Its policy. 
There is none In Ihe student Bulletin. Grote has neither seen nor heard of such s 
definition, and does nol know K one even exists. 

Grole feels that while it may be helpful to have a written deflnllion of the term 
" — — n all-encompassing one which would be

avcid (u 



taken directly from Purdue's maalcr course schedule, the

McCanis, however, would rather wait lo see If a business department's request

"Any relief from the fee would have to come through the academic unit seeking

Students ripped off 



In America, we're supposed to gel 
whal we pay for. Wc learned about that 
In elementary school 

Unloriunaiely, we don't always get 
what we pay for. Sometimes the can- 
fiumer Is ripped off. 

College students, wlien they enroll in 
college, are also eonsumere They pay a 
large fee to become educated. Unfor- 
tunately, college students are also 
ripped off. They may be ripped off by a 
shady dealer selling gooda on campus, 
but you wouldn't CKpcct them lo be 
rippHid off by the very college thai is 
trying to educate (hem. 

Twenty-one students enrolled in COM 
334. electronic jDUmalism, believe ihcy 
have been ripped oft. Each student was 
assessed a J28 fee for a two-hour lab. The 
studenlA don't believe Ihey have at- 
tended anylhing which may constitute a 
lab, and have asked tor iheir money 

David McCanls, chair of the com- 
munication and theatre deparlment, 
said the nature of the instruction con- 
stitutes a lab The faculty delermined 
the course will be taught with a Iwo-hour 
lecture, two-hour lab pattern. The class 
only meets, however, twice a week tor 



less than an-bour-and-a-half each 
meeting. 

The students use one textbook— a book 
they bought at Follett's Bookstore, not 
from Ihc communication and theatre 
deparlment. 

The IPFW Bulletin didn't mention a 
lab McCant said that was a mistake on 
the printer's part. We understand 
printer's mistakes. They happen all the 
time. The fact that the printer made a 
mistake, however, doesn't let the 
university off the hook The university 
should show it can act in good faith and 
refund the money. 

As for what constitutes a lab and how 
it is assessed, the faculty should form a 
committee to look into labs and lab fees 
and issue a report to the boards of 
trustees for both Purdue and Indiana 
universities. 

The definition of a lab should be 
spelled out in ofticial university 
publications, such as the Bulletin, 
Schedule of Classes and the Student 
Handbook. 

A definition of a lab would help the 
students be better educated c 
and thus possibly prevent ! 
problems in the future. 



Will Giusti return? 



On the surface, Chancellor Joseph P. 
Giusli's leave of absence is clear. He is 
convening a council of presidents in 
Indiana to gather information to assist 
Congress In reauthorization of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965. 

His duties are supposed to be tem- 
porary, and by all accounts he will 
return lo IPFW when his assignment is 
completed. 

Rumors have persisted, however, that 
Giusli won't be returning to LPFW when 
his assignment concerning the High 
Education Act is completed. 

Actions taken by different 
organizations at IPFW have given the 
impression that Giusti is fighting for his 
career at IPFW. 

The Fort Wayne Faculty Senate 
passed a resolution praising Giusli's 
work as presiding officer of the senate. 
Raymond E. Pippert, professor of 
malhemalhics and author of the senate's 
resolution said, "There was nothing 
implicit or explicit (in the resolution). 

"lit isl something the whole senate 
can support. It is a gesture of ap- 
preciation from the senate." 

A couple of days after the senate's 
resolution, iPFW's community relations 
ofHce released a slick-paged, black-and- 
white booklet, titled. "Giusti: the first 



This booklet gave the immediate 
impression that Giusti was the periect 
chancellor and adminislrator at IPFW. 
But who is community relations trying to 
impress with the booklet? Community 
Relations may have aroused more 
curiosity than it would have liked with 
the booklet. 

It Giusli is returning to IPFW, why 
pubhsh a booklet? 

A third action which may be adding lo 
the impression that Giusti won't be 
returning to IPFW is a resolution passed 
by the IPFW Student Senate. The senate 
thanked Giusti tor his job at IPFW and 
wished him a speedy return lo IPFW 

Like the other resolution and the 
booklet, it praised Giusti for the same 
things: enhancing the image of IPFW. 

While rumors will always persist after 
a person in power lakes a leave of ab- 
sence, these rumors seem lo make 
certain facets of the rumors true— that 
Giusti will not return to IPFW when his 
job with the higher education act is 
complete. 

The IPFW community and the nor- 
theastern-Indiana community need to 
know the truth. Will Giusti be reluming

Increase funding 



Five years ago, the slate of Indiana 
provided both Indiana and Purdue 
universities about to percent of their 
funding. Today, that Tigure is close to GO 
percent. 

Five years ago, student fee provided 
both universities less than 30 percent of 
their funding. Today, students provide 
both universities about 35 percent of 
their funding. 

Faculty members at both Indiana and 
Purdue universities are among the 
lowest paid in the Big Ten Conference, 
with Purdue faculty in eighth place and 
Indiana in 10th place. Throughout 
September, the presidents of Indiana 
and Purdue, John W. Ryan and Steven C. 
Bee ring, travelled together throughout 
the stale appealing lo members of the 
General Assembly for increased funding 
for the universities. 

They are using economic develop- 
ment as one of their arguments. This is 
probably the best argument. 

"Indiana University is graduating 
(tie kind of talent that can make a dif- 
ference in the stale's economic future," 
Ryan said. "And make a difference they 
will because a large number of Indiana 
University graduates call Indiana their 
home. There are over 150,000 lU alumni 
throughout Indiana. Indiana business 



works because of the 24,000 Indiana 
University business graduates 
throughout the state making it work." 

Beering said: "Our state's economy 
today depends more than ever on our 
mveslmenl in higher education. Every 
evaluation of regions that have 
prospered in recent years has shown 
that tIrst-clBss universities are the 
catalyst. Certainly, there are other 
factors, but it cannot happen without 
quality education." 

A3 the two presidents travel 
throughout the slate, making their 
appeal, they should let it be known that 
students shouldn't be asked to carry the 
brunt anymore. 

Tuition at IPFW and throughout the 
lU and Purdue systems was increased 
by about 7 percent last spring. Pell 
Grants and other forms of financial aid 
haven't kept up with the increases In 
tuition, 

Indiana, Purdue and IPFW are all 
stale-supported institutions, and as 
such, the state should be Increasing its 
support. 

If the slate is serious about economic 
development, higher education, lo again 
quote Beering, '■First-class universities 
are the catalyst."

director of acbvlties and student union buildingcoordina tor, 
have decided to resurrect the International Students

The chib was formed on campus in 1967 by a group of 
(^iban refugee students. The number of International 
students on campus declined, and the club's actJviUes

He said the club should be a social organization focused on 
giving Intemabonat students a chance to meet each other 
and share their Ihou^ts and Ideas. 

The second area, Ulmer said. Is one of acultural obJecUve. 
This would enable the members to share their respective 
cultures with other club members and the rest of the IPFW 
student body. 

The third area, Ulmer said, la one of a locus on political 
and educational objective. This would give (he members a 
chance to Identify and articulate their needs, which in him, 
would help the university respond to those needs. 
... The club will meet in (he coming months to elect c^ficers 
and form committees toorganlie club activities. 

At the Sept 24 meeting, some activities were sutcgested 



Among those suggcsteit. included an InternaUonal potluck

Without senior cocaptiln 
Clara Schortgen la the 
lineup, the IPFW women's 
i-olteyball team was nip- 
posed lo hai-e ■ long week; 
but no one told them that 

Instead, the Mastodons 
went M last week, and no 
ooe is mm pleased than 
Schortgen. But more Im- 
porlanlly. was she sur- 

"Naw, I had all the con- 
iideniie in the world In Uum. 
1 thmjght the seniora came 
through and that is Im^ 
porta nt becuase Ihe younger 
kids on the cnirl are locking 
for someone lo lead them." 

Schortgen ■ [rained an 
anklo during a match al 
Grand Valley Slate and h«a 
been out nearly two week* 
Her replaeemeoi has t&gt;een 
Julie Hefty, a young and 
heretofore untested fresh- 
man Yet Hefty has [roved a 
pleasant surprise, prowling 
the frontline and showing 
occasional flashes of 
dominance usually provided 
by Schortgen. "She Is 
playing citremely well fa- 
never having played a 
middle poslUon beJore," 
says Schortgeno* Hefty 

And Hefty is not the only 
youngster on Ihe squad 
There are a handful dtrcsh- 
men contributing to the 

although this may have been 
a concern early in the year, 
Schortgen is impressed with 
their abilities. "I think 
they're doing a ffeat Job. 
They've accepted their 



rdes. Also, they are ftr 
mire advanced thati we 
(senlon) were fixir yeui 
ago, and thu Is a Iwlpi 
They're dolag a Hne Job 
eiecullng." 

Although the Mtstodoa 
will welcotne Schorlgatfa 
rtbjm. possibly u early u 
this weekend, aha is ttlll 
quick to dUb M any Ideas 
that the team's tucceas it 
dependent oo her, "In 
volleyball. It lakes mere 
than one player to win a 
game. I'm only go(ng to be 
OS good as the setters and 
Lhey, In hini. only as good at 
the paisen." She Is willing 
to take It ooe step further, 
saying. "I think II has helpul 
the team that I am out. 
because people are playing 
better together." 

Schortgen his by no 
means taken a passive role 
since t&gt;elng oil of Ihe starl- 
ing lineup. "I try lo help out 
OS much as poulble; lo be 
positive and encMuaglng lo 
the players on the floor, I tiy

It's wotklng. tor In the Uil
