According to Hamburger the sequence 
consists of two classes. Math 16311 and

"What's new about this class is that I try

"1 have been working on a couple of

though underneath il il wry hard" 

"A lol of the research activity has been

connection between his research and his stu-

I changed my major and decided Urn I would

After two long years of being a part of

fixed deadlines and having lo write two pages 
worm of copy for each story would force me 
into quitting, insirarf , I gradually grew used to

could communicate through writing. One year 
Eater, I was pnmoted from features editor to 
editor. Now, another year lain, I find myself 
leaving a job I've loved since Ihc fall of 1998. 

Tbe tamificauans of this decision are

after aD. is one of ibe best r ve seen assembled 
since I've been here and I'm sine whoever the

Regal switch doesn't bode well for future 



by Ben Freese, Staff Writer 

Over a month ago a change in Regal 
Cinemas look place and il appears to only 

prise rip off Ibe public Regal Gncmas 
(Ihc company which owns and runs 
almost every theater in town, with the 
exception of Southtown. Ihc Cinema 
Center and Ihc newer Cinema Grill) 
decided it would pull a quick switch 
involving Glenbrook and Holiday I &amp; 2 
(tbe big, run-down theaters beside 
Holiday 6). The Glenbrook Cinema. 
which bad been a disc runt theater for sev- 
eral years now, suddenly changed places, 
money-wise, wilb the old disheveled 

price now arc required to get into the 
Glenbrook location., whereas Holiday I &amp; 



that we get lo see discount movies on the 
largest screens in Fort Wayne, Ibe nostal- 
gic old Holiday I &amp; 2 (which was proba- 
bly one of tbe firsi theaters, out of all Ibe 
current ones, id ever be hull here in tbe 
Fort"). Thai's about where any of Ibe sup- 
nosed good Qualities stop. 

Holiday is still the same run-down 
complex. No renovations (at least not thai 
one can physically see), no change in 
atmosphere and no 
for customers (unless you count the "love 
gangc"-rype machine in the lobby that 
tells you if you're a told lisb or a hot 
lover). Yep, we arc quite lucky: I can't 
believe what a concept il is thai Ibe same 
old embarrassing situation (involving how 
ustamers must walk through ■ ball- 
way id get id Holiday screen I 
because ibcy can't afford u&gt; open up 
'he other side of the theater com- 
plex) sun exists. Glenbrook is 



diet of movies (probably an average of 
three theater lilms a week from about 
1992 lo a few yeas ago and. now, one or 
iwo a week) and 1 can say Ibis isn't ihc 
fust tunc Regal Cinemas has said "shove 
oil" lo the fans of filmdom. Does anybody 
remember those poor union workers with 
signs saying "sry no id Regal Cinemas™? 
Well, sadly, those were professional pro- 
jCctioDrsts who were find in favor of hn- 

Of course, nobody stopped going to ibe 

movies and I've seen Ibe ugly res alls

done correctly, then things that shouldn't

Now. Regal Cinemas aren't all bad,

The rap veriion. tilled "Rap 
Superstar," has a rap beat with a tap 
style while the rock version. "Rock 
Superstar,' is the same music as 
"Rap Superstar" with a heavy metal 
feci. "Rock Superstar" is remtnii. 
ccnl of when Cypress teamed up 
with Pearl Jam for the song "Real 
Thing' on the "Judgment Night" 
soundtrack, a refreshing approach lo 
Cypress Hill's already e*cellem 

Both versions of 'Superstar," 
which have received airplay all over 
the nation, can be found on Cypress 
Hill's latest album, 'Skull and 
Bones.* Other tracks worth men- 
tioning from the album are "Valley 
of Chrome," "Can't Get the Best of 
Me;' "What You Want From Me" 



and others. The album is built 
around (he innovative style they 
forged with their third album. 
Temple of Boom." and continued 
with their fourth major album 
'Cypress Hill TV.' 

The older Cypress Hill siyle is 
still evident, though, existing uisiiiti 
songs as 'Cant Get the Best or Me* 
as much of the lyrics arc repeated 
throughout the song. "Can't Get the 
Besl of Me," despite its copying the 
lyrical style of earlier Cypress Hill 
songs, mines in a guitar in an 
attempt to combine their old style 
with the style they've basically kept 
suppressed until now. 

Personally. I think many of the 
songs on this album make the album 
worth getting. However, as "Can't 
Get the Best of Me" dcmonsiriiits, 
not all or the songs can be classified 
in that category. The repeating of 
'You can't gel the best of me... canl 
gel the best of me" gets annoying 
afier the fourth cycle and makes me 
want to turn off my CD player. Also, 
1 can't agree with how they mned in 
the electric guitar with the beat that 
was established through the lyncs 
Something about it just diiln'i click 

Fans of Cypress Hill shouldn't 
fret over one terrible song. Whatever 
was lost on "Can't Get the Best of 
Me" was made up for in "Valley of 
Chrome." This song demonstrates 
the proper way to combine heavy 



mctaT guitars with rap music. A soft 
electric guitar can be beard in the 
background during the regular vers- 
es, which are sung in softer tones (as 
they did throughout the 'Cypress 
Hill IV" album), with the guitar gel- 
ling cranked during Ihe chorus. The 
mix puts tap and rock together in an 
easy-lo-lisien-io piece of music. 

As much as I enjoy "Valley of 
Chrome." 1 think I like bow they 
presented "Superstar" even better. 
Normally, I donl like remixes, bul 
each of the versinns'of "Supeistar" 
could ptobably make a decent show- 
ing on Billboard's lists, given 
enough exposure. 1 especially like 
the cock version as I feel they copied 
the success made in crealing "Valley 
of Chiome" in ibis version. As rare

dial iv.mil better than the original 
lln- -.I'-ng hiis to be one of the besl

Overall, this album Is a very

very well, although il doesn't beat

(Yprcss Hill came out strong with

'Double Jeopardy' doesn't live up to expectations 



by Malissa Fritz, 
Features Editor 



This past weekend. I was able 
to take in Ihe movie "Double 
Jeopardy" starring Ashley Judd and 
Tommy Lee Jones. Thankfully, a 
friend let me borrow the film so that 

Libby Parsons (Judd) is a hap- 
pily married woman enjoying i j ■._ 
success of her husband, Nick 
(fltuce Greenwood) and very much 
involved with their sou. Malty An 
abrupt change occurs when she 
spends a romantic evening an a 
sailboat with Nick. While ai sea, 
she finds Nick missing anil discov- 
ers a knife on the boat deck and 
blood everywhere. Shortly there- 
after, she is arrested by Ihe Coasl 
Guard and is placed behind bars. 
While imprisoned, Libby 






i her t 



friend, Angie (Annabclh Gish). 

Angie disappears soon alter 
Libby is imprisoned. With the help 
of some fellow inmates, the 
accused murderer finds her friend 
living in San Francisco wilh the 



very much alive Nick. Libby does- 
n't pursue revenge while in prison, 
but rather patiently waits for her 
parole (advice thai she gels from 
the same two afoiemuiiiancii 
inmaics who welcome her with 
open arms for no apparent reason 
and seem to help her wilh every- 
thing accordingly). One of the two 
inmaits was a lawyer and explained 
that since Libby was already con. 
viclcd of murdering her husband, 
under the fifth amendment, she 
could not be tried again. 

After a suspiciously short 
period of lime for a convicted mur- 
der. Libby is taken to a halfway 
house under the supervision of 
L'ravis Lehman (Jones) From there, 
the search for her beloved son is 
underway and her quest keeps her 
out alter curfew. She realizes this 
and Ikes die stale with Travis fol- 
lowing in clo&lt;e pursuit The rest of 
the film is as much of a cliche as 
one might imagine, with the payoff 
scene having plot twists that hardly 
catch ihe audience by surprise. 

Although the fifth amendment 
clause is noi too far fetched, some 
of the other details are. Libby's pos- 



ing ai 



a of a 



u no 



breaking and entering 
a school and destruction or federal 
property might just be enough to 
land her behind bars. Il also strikes 
me as particulatly amazing that the 
police always seem lo show up at 
jusi the right moment and Libby 
always manages to escape by trip, 
ping up ihe officers. Ironically, it is 
the same branch of government that 
manages lo convict her so quickly 
and efficiently in the beginning, 
even without a body lo show the 
jury. 

The real treat of this movie is 
Tommy Lee Jones. Jones has the 
oo'lhe-run film down lo a science 
afier his critically acclaimed role in 
"The Fugitive," The two rsclors are 
very rarely on screen together, as 
ihe nature of their rales requires 
thai they be in pursuit of each other, 

-Double Jeopardy" was 
expected to be one of Ihe best films 
thai came out. both artistically and 
financially. Unfortunately, ihe 
movie serves as a reminder thai 
those two qualities do not always

Ideas to take care of those 
summer blahs 



by Malissa Fritz, 
Features Editor 



Well, the end of the semester 
is drawing near which means tree 
time for some of our lucky fellow 
students. The question that is run- 
ning through a lot of our minds, 
beside school of course, is what is 
exactly out there lo do for fun in 
this city of Fort Wayne? How do I 
pass those summer blahs away? 
Well. I shall attempt to answer 
those ever-important questions 
with some ideas of what one can 
do to pass the time and have some 
fun over the summer break. Get 
your sunblock ready, sunglasses 
out, comfortable walking shoes, 
camera ready 10 go and a little bit 
of cash because here we go 

If you are into sports, take in 
a ball game or two at Memorial 
Stadium Watch the Fori Wayne 
Wizards in one of the 7,046 seats 
in the stadium. Also, there are 
other baseball and Softball games 
that wdl be taking place around the 
city and surrounding areas. Take 
me out to the ball game? 

If you arc not interested in 
watching sports, but love the out- 
doors and possibly lake pan your- 
self in a game or two. lake some 
time and walk around the lovely 
parks of this city. Foster Part, 
located at Old Mill Road and 
Rudisill Boulevard, is one of the 
biggest parks in the city. Facdilies 
at the park consist of an 18-hole 



golf course, trails for biking and 
biking and fields for football and 
soccer. Tennis courts and baseball 
diamonds arc also available. 

One of Fort Wayne's newest 
parks is Kreagcr Park, located on 
North River Road. Kreager Park's 
227 acres of land features such 
activities as tennis, baseball and 
soccer. You can also enjoy the 
peace and quiet by having a picnic 
or by discovering the land by bik- 
ing and biking on the park's trails. 

The city's pools will be open 
for those wishing to cool of from 
the hot Indiana heat that we are all 
so accustomed to, ok, so maybe not 
all of us ore accustomed to it. 
Enjoy a day out by one of the 
pools, with family and friends, 
wbite getting a little sun and 
enjoying the outdoors at the same 
lime. lust watch for those bugs 
crawling and flying around. 

The Three Rivers Festival

extravaganza with a variety events 
that arc spread throughout the city. 
Starting with the parade and end- 
ing with the fireworks, these vari- 
ous events are geared towards all 
ages Numerous events are held at 
Headwaters Pork. 

Okay, so maybe you arc not

If animals are not your 
favorite thing to go see on your 
summer break and you would 
rather stay inside in the air condi- 
tioning than deal with the Indiana 
summer heat, there are several 
museums in the city that you can 
visit. The Firefighlcr Museum on 
W. Washington Boulevard upholds 
the city's fircfighting heritage. The 
Firefighter Museum displays 
equipment and andque fire trucks 
that date back to the 1890s. along
