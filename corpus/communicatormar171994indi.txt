Legislators reject funding for new building 



by Jo Ann Stelnforth 
News Editor 

The IPFW Science Building Project has 
been temporarily on hold 33 state legislators 
wrapped up their "'short session." 

The Indiana House of Representatives last 
month approved 522 million for the new 
science building. 

Dill S1375 was supported by 
Representative D. Patrick Bauer, a democ- 
rat from South Bend. 

The Senate rejected funding the proposal. 

"They did not believe in funding addi- 
tional money for another building," said 
Winfteld C. Moses, Democrat, Indiana 
House of Representatives. 

The bill which went into tie conference 



committee did not include bonding authori- 
ty for the science building. 

"It was during this period where time ran 
out to vote on this issue," said Moses. 

The proposal for the new science building 
was the second of a two-pan proposal. 

The first proposal included The 
Engineering and Technology Building, 
which was approved in 1988. The building 
opened last year according to plan. 

The science building was originally to be 
part of the new engineering building, but 
the project was so large, it was divided into 
two pans. 

In a recent statement from Judith M. 
Clinton, Director of University Relations. 
"The science building is critical to expand 
and improve facilities for science education 



at IPFW and to help the university meet 
new environmental standards." 

This renovation is needed to relieve over- 
crowding campus wide" Clinton said. 

"By renovating Kctller Hall, which 
opened in 1964, existing space can be used 
more efficiently to alleviate campus wide 
space pressures," said Clinton. 

"The renovated space will permit the 
computerization of instruction in English 
and mathematics, create new laboratories 
for computer science and physics, resolve 
overcrowding in Classroom Medical 
Building (by relocating Sociology and 
Anthropology programs to Keltler Hall), 
and add badly needed classroom space to 
the campus inventory," said Clinton. 

"The second half of the two-part plan to 



improve science and engineering education 
needs to be put back on track," said 
Clinton. 

"The original proposal was modified six 
years ago so that engineering and technolo- 
gy facilities could be considered in one 
biennium and science facilities in the fol- 
lowing biennium" said Clinton. A bienni- 
um is two years long for legislators. 

"The Engineering and Technology 
Buildings was approved in 1988 and the 
building opened last year, according to 
plan, said Clinton. Unfortunately, the sec- 
ond part of the proposal, for the science 
building and Kctller renovation, came for- 
ward in 1993, when the legislature was 
unable to approve any new buildings. 

"We are very disappointed that the sci- 



ence building has been delayed once again, 
the science facilities at IPFW need to be 
renovated and expanded as soon as possible 
to accommodate increasing student demand 
and to keep up with environmental and 
technological standards," added Clinton. 

"We will be working to try to gel that 
project funded in the next legislation ses- 
sion and we will need continued public sup- 
port Tor this project to get that project 
approved," said Clinton. 

"Wc hope to present another request at 
the next session, in January 1995," said 
Clinton. "The need has not gone away." 

"I imagine the bill will be introduced in 
the next long session, a legislative session 
that lasts two years, which will be in 
January 1995," said Moses.

News Editor 

The University Resource Policy 
Committee met Friday. March 4, to 
continue discussions of a 25-year 
plan for this campus. 

Issues discussed at the meeting 
were budgetary affairs subcommit- 
tee resolution, parking near Walb. 
the towing policy, and identifica- 
tion of a long-range planning 



cxpen. 

According to Linda S. Wooten, 
chair, the committee agreed to have 
Vice Chancellor of financial affairs 
Walter J. Branson arrange to bring 
in a facilities planner and a land- 
scape and architect planner from 
Purdue to come to the IPFW cam- 
pus to assist in creating a long- 
range master plan. 

"In the late 60s, a facility master 
plan was developed for the campus, 



which identified certain areas for 
academic buildings, parking, and 
recreational facilities," said 

Branson. 

"We are now 25 years into that 
plan, and wc have added some new 
buildings. In the 
next few months.

Lady Dons finish season 



by Jennifer Skiner 
Start" writer 

The Lady Dons basketball team 
finished off itsl993-94 season with 
a 17-10 overall record and 10-8 in 
the GLVC. 

"1 am very pleased with the sea- 
son," said Head Coach Eileen 
Kleinfelter, "We Hip flopped our 
record from last season (10-17)." 

Since the team's first game, a vic- 
tory over Taylor by nine points, the 
Lady Dons have advanced in the 
GLVC standing to fifth place. Last 
season the team lied for sixth. 

"In the beginning, wc set some 
very high goals." said Kleinfelter. 
"If you don't set high goals, you 
won't meet high goals. Wc were 
very competitive." 

Throughout the season, the Lady 
Dons were challenged with tough 
competition. 

In the Lady Buff Classic against 
West Texas State with a 104-2 
record, the Lady Dons had a rush of 
"adrenaline pumping" throughout 
the game, even though they suf- 
fered di-te.il 

In conference play, the team 
defeated third-ranked Southern 
Indiana in both games. 

"It's very gratifying to beat them 
on their home floor," stated 
Kleinfelter "Wc didn't expect to 
win by 21 points" 

Kleinfcltet said each player has 
her own talent and combined the 
team has overlaying strengths. 

Sophomore Lindy Jones, named 
first team All-GLVC. ranks fourth 
in conference steals and field goal 
percentage and is top-ranked in free 
throw percentage. 

Pam Edwards, senior fifth-year 
redshirt, didn't start until confer- 
ence play because of an achilles 
injury. Scoring her 1,000 points in 
January, Edwards is one of the 
team's leading scorers. 

Senior Kim Recker. ranks ninth in

career scoring. 

Dawn Dressier, senior, leads in 
rebounds and is one of the teams 
leading scorers. 

Graduating five seniors, Dressier, 
Recker, Edwards, Amy Perkins, 
and Michelle Conley. Kleinfelter is 
optimistic about next season. 

The Lady Dons, next season, 
expect to be more of a three-point 
shooting team with freshman 
Wendy Rcckers and Jones shoot- 
ing. 

The big position needing to be 
filled will be Kim Recker's post 
position. 

"Pam has been effective for us on 
the boards," said Kleinfelter. "She 
has been a leader by example." 

The team will also be advancing 
freshmen into play. Kleinfelter said 
there's talent on the bench people 
haven't seen yet. 

The last game of the Lady Don's 
1993-94 season ended in a 77-59 
victory over St. Josephs. 

"During the last game, everyone 
played and was effective," stated 
Kleinfelter. "Everyone supported 
each tidier well."

City deaths gain 
community's attention 

Within the past month the city of Fort 
Wayne has seen 5 homicides. Most of the indi- 
viduals were young African-Americans well 
under twenty-five years of age. America's 
African-American youth are clearly in a state 
of crisis and something needs to be done. 

Since the last two homicides have occurred, 
so-called preachers and leaders in the commu- 
nity have decided that something needs to be 
done. 

is the African-American community in Fort 
Wayne going to finally address the real issues 
that are facing it's community? Are they going 
to face the fact that they have lost control of 
their young people? 

Are the bourgoise blacks going to come 
down from their high horses, help their com- 
munity, and remember where they came from? 

It appears as though the middle-aged adults 
in the community have either given up on the 
youth, or are simply tired and feel a sense of 
hopelessness. 

Young African-American men and women 
have lost all sense of self-esteem and self- 
respect for themselves and those around them. 
It becomes very apparent in the young 
African-American's youth demeanor and the 
often disheartening rise of black-on-black 
crimes. 

With summer approaching soon, most citi- 
zens in the community dread the idea of the 
heat and warm weather that infamously invites 
more crime and chaos. 

Rhetoric and no action will not effectively 
put an indentation on this serious problem. 
Serious action on the part of all the citizens is 
not only necessary, but essential.

Comment of the week: 

"I tend to agree that celibacy for a time is worth 
considering, for sex is dirty if all it means is win- 
ning a man, conquering a woman, beating some- 
one out of something, abusing each other's digni- 
ty in order to prove that I am a man, I am a 
woman."

Letters to the editor 



IPFW students still have a long way to go 



To the Editor 

I WAS THERE!....lhat Thursday 
morning in CM, but I think it was 
after Paul Tuppcr was there I went 
to the lounge to escape one frustrat- 
ing atmosphere and landed in 
another. 1 sat down to relax, stare 
absently at the TV. The conversa- 
tion of those gathered around the 
TV drifted to me. "I'm glad they 
have the Gay Games. It would be a 
good way to round'em all up so you 
could v'-i i-iLi or bomb' em or some- 
thing." said one particularly fat, 
slovenly, greasy-looking, blond 
lough-guy. The poodle -doed chicks 
with him all giggled in agreement. 
When the blond saw that I was lis- 
tening he lowered his voice, but at 
least they continued to talk. After 
all, I may look like a dyke, but he 
could not be sure. He talked, then, 
about some guy who said he'd been 



to the games two years in a row, 
and how the blond guy bad "plenty 
of reason" to rough up that guy, but 
was generous and did not. Then the 
conversation turned to beer swill- 
ing, sex in cars, getting f — cd up, 
and then church?! Well, yeah, llicy 
were talking about after church and 
what Susie told who at church, but 
these same people apparenily go to 
church. Ah. ..church You know, it's 
a good thing that their civil rights 
have not been reduced to whether 
or not people find their Christian 
fundamentalism distasteful or not. 
It reminded me of the idiotic quotes 
from the 3-8-94 article on Gas City 
in the Journal Gazette: "...if they're 
queer, we'd have to kill them," 

Anyway, 1 sat there and fumed. I 
did not invite him to the Stonewall 
25 celebration this June, the week 
of the Gay Games, nor the March 
for Human Rights. I did not do any- 



thing but get angry. And I am sorry 
foriL 

Last November I went to the 
NGLTF Creating Change confer- 
ence for gays, lesbians, bisexuals, 
and parents and friends of. I went 
with high aspirations that 1 could 
change the face of Fort Wayne. I 
came back forgetting that I don't 
know many of our gay community, 
and therefore lack support against 
the shadow of physical violences 
such as happened at Gas City. My 
haircut these days gets me enough 
comments and thrown objects. I 
might have been stronger with sup- 
port. I might have felt safer if the 
Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhance- 
ment Act was going to be enforced 
without question. But jurors can be 
prejudiced too. 

I don't dismiss people's right to 
hate, but I do believe that education 
might change some of the bate to at 



least tolerance. Hopefully, one day 
gays will not be picked out of a 
crowd. But while gays are being 
picked out of a crowd in a negative 
fashion, gays might as well pick 
themselves out of the crowd in a 
positive fashion to counteract igno- 
rance. There is no P-Flag creating 
social change on campus. There is 
no USS A branch of an LGB organi- 
zation here, though there might be 
an affiliate at Btoomington. There 
is no united group offering to edu- 
cate within the campus system: no 
awareness programming, gay diver- 
sity, celebration, no panels of 
LGB's to answer questions, no PFs 
to talk with hclerophobes, no 
LGB's lo talk with homophobes. 

This all should be, it's not, despite 
its importance.

Q: 



What would you like the new Chancellor to do? 




Stephanie Kaiser 
Freshman 

"I would like lo see 
the new chancellor lo 
try to get more funds 
for improvements in 
the physical science 
laboratories." 




Barbara Howard 
Freshman 

"I would like to see 
her do something 
about the parking sit- 
uation. I feel there is a 
strong need for anoth- 
er garage for the stu- 
dents! Not the staff. 
Half the time the staff 
lot is only half full 
while we students 
miss classes because 
we can't park our 
cars." 



Michelle Boykin 
Sophomore 

"Low level classes 
should be low level, 
not start from the end. 
And end up at the 
beginning. The com- 
munication gap 
should be more open 
than closed when it 
comes to learning. 
(Can we all get 
along?)" 




Jason Edwards 
Freshman 

"The Chancellor 
should spend the 
largest part of his/her 
time to find a better 
way to spend tuition 
money. One idea I 
would have is to build 
another parking gar- 
age to help alleviate 
the parking problem."

Hypocrisy often lies within Christianity 



by F- Lane Douse 
Feature* editor 

There's a saying going around. 
It's noi new nor is il old. It's 
becoming one of the most common 
dcfcn.scs heard in any debate deal- 
ing with a sociaJ issue. This saying 
transcends ethnic background and 
gender. 

The saying: "As a Christian, 1 
cannot believe in that because my 
religion docs not believe in it, and, 
if you believe in that, you must be a 
sinner." 

It's not always said in that man- 
ner, but il is said. Now, 1 do whole- 
heartedly believe there are some 
good Christian folk who do not use 
this saying and arc actually true 
Christians. How do wc know that? 
Their actions reflect thai of ituc 
Christians. 

However, the concern of this 
defense is the fact that a lot of peo- 
ple who consider themselves 
Christians do use this defense. It is 
becoming dangerous because these 
types of people who arc not only 
influencing our children, giving 
Christianity a bad rap, but arc also 
increasing America's descent into 
hell by continuing to denounce 
people who arc different according 
to what they know in terms of 
being a "true follower of Christ." 

I think for people to fully under- 
stand what 1 am talking about they 
need to examine the history of how 
Christians have affected not only 
this country but the world. 

For instance, the Crusades is a 
prime example of Christians at 
work. Now, if I recall history cor- 
rectly, it was self-righteous 
Christians who began the mass 
murdering of Muslims because 
they fell they only Christian folk 
could inhabit Jerusalem. If you 
were not Christian, then you had to 
go because you committed a crime 



against God. Now, doesn't their 
own Bible say that killing Ls a sin. 
Shall I quote, Thou shall not kill." 
But, I guess since these folks claim 
God instructed them and the 
Church supported their actions, 
they arc exempt from the Ten 
Commandments, [ don't think so. 

If we speed up to this century and 
examine how these Christians have 
affected the world around us, peo- 
ple will see why Christianity is get- 
ting a bad rap. 

I also think it is important to look 
at the effect these Christians had in 
this country. For instance, they 
assimilated different people into 
seeing their religion as being the 
right way. 

In "Racism in America: Opposing 
Viewpoints," Carol Hampton, a 
member of the Caddo Indian 
Nation, comments on the detrimen- 
tal effect while Christians had on 
Native Americans when they dis- 
covered this country. 

"Well-meaning people, many of 
them representing their churches, 
presented federal government 
agents with a policy of assimilation 
of American Indians. If they failed 
at annihilating us, they would oblit- 
erate us through making us in their 
image, albeit darker. As one of 
those good-hearted men said, "Kill 
the Indian and save the man. 

"If wc were to survive, our tribal 
identities would cease to exist. 
These 'friends' of ours looked at 
our reservations and saw what they 
referred lo as poverty, Tilth, and 
pagan rituals. They failed to see the 
beauty, spirituality, generosity, and 
love of the land that marked our 
lives. Believing thai they would 
"save" us, they took the land that 
sustained us." 



Didn't these people even think to 
ask if these people were actually 
lost? 

The same thing happened to the 
African slaves that were brought 
over here. They were stripped of 
their culture and forced to live in a 
world that sees them as "less than 
human." But they were savages, 
remember? 

Whenever there is a discussion on 
issues such as homosexuality, abor- 
tion, or sex education, it is lo cer- 
tain groups of Christians who 
denounce others as being "abnor- 
mal, sodomites, baby-killers, liber- 
als who want to pass out condemns, 
and of course, sinners." Yet they 
fail to see that by all of their judg- 
ing, they haven't even began to 



take the wooden planks out of Ibeir 
eyes to see they are committing a 
sin, the sin of judging others. 

These are the same people who 
sit in church and listen to these 
ministers who are not educating 
their congregations on the word of 
God, but instead are Tilling them 
with their own personal agenda. 
Instead of allowing people to tap 
into the God-like force that lies 
within themselves, Christianity has 
become the most effective tool in 
controlling people's actions, emo- 
tions, morals and values. 

This is what I am talking about. 
the fact that people in society have 
seem to prefer having people inter- 
pret and present information to 
them, instead of searching, finding, 



and interpreting the truth for what 
it is. 1 believe that until people 
begin to look at the Dibit- from 
their own personal viewpoint, chal- 
lenge the information with a minis- 
ter in hopes of learning why they 
feel a certain way, and create their 
own personal relationship with 
God, America will continue on Iter 
journey to hell. 

When it comes down lo it, only 
one person can truthfully commu- 
nicate lo God about how he or she 
feels, and that is lhai person.

Jim Breuer is not your average comedy 
performer. He's a walking, breathing trans- 
former; one minute he is a flamingo in the 
Florida heat, next he's a tough New Yoris 
pigeon and then he's a one man party playing 
the most unique cast of guests you've ever 
seenl This talented actor/comedian portrays 
everything from the ordinary to the absurd 
with his special ability to immediately become 
the character at hand. 

Jim's act is a grab bag of hilarious jokes. 
and superb physical comedy. .While other 
comedians rely on sight gags and a rubbery 
face, Jim is a comedian with something to say. 
that is aftvavs insightful and always hysterical. 
He's a native New Yorker who has been "kfling' 
at clubs and campuses regularly, is a cast 
member of FOX television's Uptown Comedy 
Cbb. and has appeared on VHl's Fools For 
Love and ASEs Caroline's Comedy Hour. Jims 
fresh, high-energy performances redefine 
words like "zany" and \vacky" and make him 
one of the most unique performers working 
in comedy today. 




For the past nine years, singer/songwrit- 
er/keyboardist Rick Kelley has earned a repu- 
tation as a solid performer in the college 
market. His interpretation of Motown-soul 
classics, emphasizing crowd interaction, along 
with his timely original material, have 
impressed audiences enough to vote him the 
coveted NACA Campus Entertainment Award 
in the Coffeehouse category in 689. 1990. 199Z 
and 1994. Rick has also been nominated for the 
NACA Campus Entertainer of the Year Award 
for the past frve years. And in r992. Rick was 
the Campus Activkies Today Readers' Choice 
Awards' Best Male Entertainer. Rick's songs 
have also been signed by several major pub- 
lishers. And currently. Rick is stated to perform 
his song "Ravaged" on the soundtrack of an 
upcoming episode of Showtime's Red Shoe 
Diaries. As a performer. RicK has played at 
more than 1000 college campuses and has 
opened for such notable acts as Robert 
Townsend, Sinbad, and Jake Johannsen.

"We went from African Kings lo 
.Martin Lutlier King/Now ihcy want 
they waul to make us all Rodney 
King," rhymes Freddie Foxxx, in 
his new single "So Tough." 

Actress and rapper Queen Latifah 
adds a reggae twist in the new sin- 
gle "So Tough" and in Ihc final 
words of the song Lalifah stales: 
We must live-life, We must Uiink- 
ilie mind, We must leant -lessons. 

This Iwcnty-scven year old rap- 
per, from Wcsibury New York, 
combines the base beat with a con- 
scious message from the school of 
hard knocks. 

"I do mil try and be like other rap- 
pers. I give to ihcm raw and then I 
give io them straight," said Freddie 
Foxxx. 

Foxxx expressed bis frustration 
with the music industry and me fact 
that he could not gel a record com- 
pany lo produce his album because 
he not only wanted to entertain 
people but also io speak the truth 
through his own life experiences. 
■ Through involving himself in the 
music department, Foxxx began his 



career early at high school, by coor- 
dinating and screening acts for the 
school talent shows. 

In 197'.), Foxxx joined the group 
Royal Nation, he then later he went 
on to produce his first album with 
the group Supreme Force. 

Foxxx has worked along with 
such groups as "Ruff Ruff, KRS- 
Onc's Sex &amp; Violence, and 
Naughty by Nature. 

In addition to his musical talents, 
Foxxx also has appeared in both 
motion pictures "Who's The ManT 
and box seller "Philadelphia." 

Although Foxxx admits that he 
lends to be very militant, which 
often is regarded as a negative 
attribute, Foxxx merely feels that 
he is just conscious of the insanity 
and hypocrisy thai lies within our 
society today. 

"I have a problem wiih African- 
Americans like Dclores Tucker. 
who put down rap music and have 
labeled it as 'gangster rap,' People 
like her are spending their energy 
on rap music and not really dealing 
with the severe and pressing issues 
lhai desperately need to be dealt 
with in our community," said 
Foxxx.
