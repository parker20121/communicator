~A UTILE POLISH 



by Darrell Parmn 
'Flic basketballs are bounc- 
ing ond I'm back because da 
Jevil made mc do it. Why else 
would I come back and report 
for a icam that manogcd only 3 

Some of last year's games were 
80 boring, ihat people gol more 
excitement out of reading una- 
bridged diclionorics. And then 
there were those tantalizing 
away-pme meals. I'd seen 
animals hu/t wmsc than them 
get up and walk away. 

One thing thai will make 
basketball play a spectator 
sport this season is the addi- 
tion of six cheerleaders. In my 
league, ivhen you feilk about 
females, you put down the 
blackjacks and use a little po- 
iisb-Q little poise. 

Tliere's Carol Baker. 



Color her a person of charm 
and beauty who is considered a 
first round drofi choice by the 
Chicago Bears. She plays flag 
football and models her ^me in 
the style of Dick Butkus: 
"destroying the football ear- 
ner." Off the field it's another 
slorj'. {Almost forgot the polish 
and poise.) Checrleading ex- 
perience and a vibrant person- 
ality have given her a new glime; 
destroying the apathy carrier. 

There's Brenda Rouse. 
Color her. a mountain climber 
who dares challenge the peaks 
of "spirit" mountain, to plant 
this university's flog there. 
Color her gutsy, color her won-

Although our campus

it seems that many students 
have still been complaining 
about their policies regard-

Presidential News Conference Held 



TTie Presidential tiaws 
Conference was held TTiureday 
promptly at 12:15- TTiirtocn 
people, mostly studcntisenators, 
attended this special event. 

PW^sidcnl Gillie slated an 
old Russian proverb, "It the 
people don't complain, you're 
doing a good job." He said he 
would like to communicate to 
the whole school population but 
't took up a lot of time and they 
wouldn't be interested in what 
the Student Government's busi- 
ness was. He does however 
have contact with the faculty 
and administration. He reported 
that Dean Manges had talked to 
him about this campus' disrup- 
tions. Gillie went onto say that 



the 



lal 



juldn-t 



bother to think about that pro- 
blem or any other problem- 
Different problems were 
discussed by the president. 
Someone in the crow'd asked 
about paid parking. Gillie said 
thai be didn't advise people to 
park in the free lot and Jic 
doesn't know lif- the inconre 



system to pay for the parking 
atmcture is valid. He said 
there were some improvements 
such as a nev( gravel "B" lot, 
Mr. Gillie ihou^t that if any of 
our other sister campuses want- 
ed to use our paid parking sink- 
ing fund they could. 

When asked about the stu- 
dent's bookstore, the President 
said that he saw much improve- 
ment of the bookstore down-' 
stairs and that the business 
charged those prices because 
the publisher set the prices of 
boi^ and that the bookstore 
has to make a profit. 'Hial ivas 
why the prices were oa they 
were. Alpha Phi Omega, Na- 
tional Service Fraternity, was 
planning on having a bookstore 
second semester of this year, 
so the student's government 
decided to drop the project. 

KTien^skcd about grades 
being wiRtlTC Id -be cause parking 
fines weren't paid, FVesidcnt 
Gillie said that it didn't hold 
up in court for students who did 
bring it to court. But the stu-

dents may not get to register 
for the next semester. If l.QOO 
students didn't pay their traffic 
fines and couldn't register, the 
adminiBtrotion would miss 20% 
of their income and probably 
would let that 1,000 students 
register without paying fines. 
TTiis could be the way the stu- 
dents could get rid of paid 
parking. 

Other subjects the Presi- 
dent touched upon were: the 
Liberal Studies program was 
being shortened by the hard 
work of the student government, 
the Traffic Appeab Court Arti- 
cle Nine bos not been suspcn 
ded, and that the bids on the 
cafeteria can't be seen by the 
student government. Gillie has 
an attorney checking out this 
fishy problem. 

To finish out the news 
conference he talked about the 
athletic fees with on interested 
gentleman in the back row. \V. 
Gillie held to his belief that 
too much money was given to 
the athletic voreity pro^m and 
it was frivolous spending. He 
said he would rather see a li- 
brary aumadeff of the sinking 



fraternity turned from plans 
to action as it launched the

A new fraternity program, 

was initiated with two being 
held during the month. The 
polls are designed to reflect 
student opinion on campus 
issues and arc intended to
