Tuberculosis scare rocks Fort; 
authorities advise testing 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

What began as a precautionary 
measure has erupted into a city- 
wide problem. 

Since the Board of Health post- 
ed public notices urging that 
library and Salvation Army 
patrons be tested for tuberculo- 
sis, officials have determined 
that people numbering in the 
thousands are turning up in doc- 
tors' waiung rooms. 

According to Susan Hansen, a 
registered nurse at the Board of 
Health's tuberculosis outpatient 

"People are generally not 
susceptible to TB unless 
their immunity is already 
down. If they are already 
sick or are fatigued, their 
bodies are more open for 
illness. " 
-Susan Hansen 

clinic, TB is a communicable 
disease transmitted primarily by 
sneezing or coughing. 

Hansen said the public can 
come into contact with infec- 
tious tuberculosis virtually any- 
where, but it is not contracted 
easily. 

"People are generally not sus- 
ceptible to TB unless their 
immunity is already down. If 
they are already sick or are 
fatigued, their bodies are more 
open for illness." Hansen noted. 

People, according to Hansen. 



can be exposed to TB but will 
not contract the disease. Instead 
iheir bodies wiU form antibodies, 
which will cause a false positive 
test result 

The Board of Health requires 
that a specific chain of testing 
steps be followed to hall the 
spread of TB. 

Jane Irmscher, Fort Wayne 
health commissioner, recom- 
mends that anyone who may 
have been exposed to TB imme- 
diately contact the Board of 
Health or their family physician. 

The first step is to have a TB 
skintesL 

Dr. David Sand, a local family 
physician, said standard proce- 
dure is to have a skin test, which 
is a shot injecting a rcocuuit into 
the arm. After the shot, the 
patient should keep an eye on 
the area and note any redness, 
swelling, or soreness. 

If within 72 hours there is a 
reaction. Sand said the palient 
should seek follow-up testing. 
The next step is chest X-rays 
to determine if the lungs are 
infected. 

According to Sand, it is not 
uncommon for a patient to have 
a positive skin reaction, but a 
negative X-ray. He said he has 
numerous patients fitting this 
description, and he added gener- 
al policy is to treat them for TB 
"juslinca.sc..," 

A positive skin test indicates 
exposure, but does not confirm a 
tuberculosis diagnosis. It must 
corroborate the X-ray results. 



Sand added that once a person 
tests positive for TB, they will 
always have a positive skin tesu 

"If the patient is under 35 years 
of age. we will put them on med- 
ication for one year as a precau- 
tionary measure. Even though 
they don't have tuberculosis, 
they have been exposed to it, and 
it is in their body. Just because 
they haven't developed it yet 
doesn't mean they won't," 
explained Sand, 

For patients over 35. Sand said 
it is more risky to start treatment 
because the side-effects of the 

"Even though they don't 
have tuberculosis, they 
have been exposed to it, 
and it is in their body. Just 
because they haven't 
developed it yet doesn't

medication are more dangerous 
than getting full-blown TB. 

Symptoms of tuberculosis 
include night sweats, fever, 
coughing with phlegm, chills, 
fatigue, shortness of breath, 
physical weakness, unexplained 
weight loss, and chest pains. 

So far, the Board of Health has 
no reported cases of TB. even 
though there have been many 
positive tests. 

Hansen recommends that peo- 
ple be tested, strictly as a pre- 
ventive 1

Co-op experience may make 
students more employable. 

89 percent of last year's gradu- 
ates received job offers before or 
just after graduation. Almost half 
of those students received offers 
from their co-op employer, 

"In today's competitive job 
market, students need something 
more than just a degree," said 
Diana Hergati, associate director 
of Career Services and Co-opera- 
tive Education, 

"The typical job search can 
take as long as six months, so 
our co-op students are way 
ahead," said Hergati 

Paul Selking, a co-op student 
working for GE Motors, said he 
wjs pleased with the program. 



"The typical job search 
can take as long as six 
months, so our cO'Op stu- 
dents are way ahead." 
-Diana Hergatt 



"I wanted ihe experience, and 
at the same time I wanted an 
income. That is the main reason 
I'm co-opping." said Selking. 

Co-op education offers students 
a chance to sample the different 
types of work available within 
their major. 

"1 work in different areas all 
the time. I get a wide perspective 
of the business, and it helps me 
determine what area I want to 
focus on," said Selking. 

Many students may shy away 
from co-op education because of 
the extra semesters it adds, but 
Selking said there isn't much dif- 
ference, 

"It really doesn't slow you 
down that much, I'll only be a 



semester behind when I gradu- 
ate. It will take me four and a 
half years." said Selking, 

"Another advantage of co- 
opping is the real worid experi- 
ence. A lot of what 1 learn. I 
could never get out of a class- 
room. There's not equivalent to 
what you can learn in the real 
world." said Selking. 

The CD-op program also offers 
advantages for IPFW and the 
employer, according to Hergatt. 

"The program offers employers 
the chance to evaluate potential 
employees on the job." said 
Hergatt 

"The program also offers area 
businesses the opportunity to 
give something back to the com- 
munity. That's very important to 
area companies." said Hergatt. 

IPFW gets input from the pro- 
gram which helps to keep its cur- 
riculum up-to-date, according to 
HergatL 

"It also builds a strong and pos- 
itive relationship between IPFW 
and the greater Fort Wayne busi- 
ness community." s^d HcrgaiL 

"The program gives students 
something relative to discuss in 
job interviews. They have some- 
thing other than their GPA to 
talk about," said Hergatt. 

Co-op graduates from IPFW 
an; entering the work force mak- 
ing from ten to 20 percent more 
than entry level employees, 
according to Hergatt. 

The program offers two types 
of co-ops. Engineering and tech- 
nology students usually enroll in 
an alternating program. 

The students work full time for 
one semester, then go to school 
full time the following semester. 

The program also offers a par- 
allel plan in which students work 
part lime throughout the entire 
school year and also attend class- 
es pan time.

STAFF EDITORIAL 



Presidential candidates 
need to debate soon 



Debates have been cancelled 
because of the uncompromis- 
ing siance of President Bush. 

Bush is still refusing to 
debate in a single moderator 
format. He hopes to side step 
high impact accusations by 
Democrat candidate. Gov. Bill 
Clinton. 

Clinton is' using the cancelled 
debates to undermine the 
Republican race. 

So our presidential candidates 
arc at a standoff, and the 
American public pays the 
price. 

One of our greatest founding 
fathers, Thomas Jefferson, said 
the main concern of our gov- 
ernment should be educating 
the pubHc on the affairs of the 
government. 

If our government is truly to 
be a government for the peo- 
ple, by the people, the general 
public must be infonned. 

Clinton has been governor of 
Arkansas for a decade, Ixii re- 
election didn't always come 
easy. 

After his fir^l term, Clinion 
lost his seat as governor. 
However, two years laier. 
Clinton talked his way back 
into the governor's mansion. 

Clinton found the Arkansas 
public felt left out of their poli- 
tics. They didn't feel Clinion 
was talking lo them, listening 
to them, involving them in 
state affairs. They elected 
someone else. 

Clinion learned fnam his mis- 
take and regained the gover- 
nor's office and the respect of 
his constituents. 

Bush needs lo learn the same 
lesson. He is trying lo block the 
involvement of the American 
people in politics. 

Bush needs to focus on listen- 
ing to the American people. 
His failure to do so thus far has 
bought him a losing ticket. 

ll is the responsibility of our 



commander in chief to inform 
the public of his actions and 
plans. It is time the public 
demanded this communication. 

The presidential debates, in 
the past, have been an invalu- 
able source of information to 
the public, especially to first 
time voters. 

There arc thbiisands of young 
Americans who will be voting 
for the first time this 
Novcmticr. 

The candidates need to offer 
morc than mud-slinging com- 
mercials and intentional distor- 
tions of the truth. 

Our current candidates are 
robbing us of our right to infor- 
mation. They are forcing the 
American public to cast voles 
based on gut reaction and pre- 
ferred hairstyles. 

It used to be that the presi- 
dential candidates rehed on the 
intelligence of the American 
public to get themselves elect- 
ed. 

Now the candidates rely on 
the stupidity of the public to 
get elected. 

The public should demand 
presidential debates. Voters 
should write to their represen- 
tatives and ask that campaign 
funding be given out with the 
requirement that the candidates 
participate in debates. 

Our government has separat- 
ed themselves from the public. 
The public must demand infor- 
mation. 

It has come to the point 
where the public believes it has 
no control over the govern- 
ment, and as it stands, we 
don't. 

The debates in East Lansing 
and Louisville have already 
been cancelled. The candidates 
should stop this childish ban- 
tering and focus on some issues 
in a televised national debate. 

We are the American public. 
We deserve better.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 



Snyder says writers should cram it 



To the Editor: 

Oscar Wilde once wrote, "Modem 
journalism by giving us the opinions 
of the uneducated, keeps us in louch 
with the ignorance of the communi- 
ty." I recalled those words as I read 
ihe bleatings of two of this commu- 
nity's ignorant sheep: Gregg 
Willson and "Dong." 

In [he past ihree years I have 
become inured to the small-minded 
and menial auacks lo my person 
which spew from the mouths of my 
pedomorphic adver5aries as the 
putrefied feces which comprises 
iheir right-wing. cam. In neatly 
every instance 1 have declined lo 
Joust in the mental cesspool in 
which these miscreants breed. In the 
mosi receni attacks by Mr. Willson 
and "Dong" - aitacks which were an 
abomination of sbnder and defama- 
tion - 1 have decided lo forswear any 
self-denial and respond in kind. 

I do not deny thai many of ihe 
positions on issues which I espouse 
are radical lo many. 1 openly and 
gladly accept ihe label of "liberal" 
or, if you will,'"radical,''lt is often 
my intent in my letters lo ihis news- 
paper to offer an alternative voice to 
ihe reactionary ouipourings of the 
majority in this community, I invite 
and welcome an open debate on the 
issues I raise. Unfortunately, howev- 
er, rather than challenge my posi- 
tions on issues or my personal phi- 
losophy these Philistines would typ- 
ically ailcmpt 10 censor me through 
the intimidaiion of their conlcmptu- 
ous personal attacks. This causes me 
more sadness ihan anRcr, and in the 
words of Adiai Stevenson on losing 
his bid for ihc Presidency. "I'm too 
old 10 cry and it is loo sad to laugh." 
Like Stevenson, this writer will not 
cry and is unable to laugh any 
longer 

It would be futile for me to address 
each of the lies in cither Mr, 
Willson's or "Dong's" sophomoric 
atiempts at verse or prose, I will. 
however, correct a few "errors." 



This writer has accumulated nine- 
ty-plus crcdil hours towards a 
degree in the ihree years I have been 
ai this campus. A difficult task tak- 
ing "one ot two classes" as Mr. 
Wdlson claims! 

Sorry, Mr. Willson but I do not 
park at meters or collect fines. If 
you are as observant as you pretend 
10 be you would sec me walking 
from either the parking garage or 
the "outer lois" where my car is 
parked from 10 a.m. until 9 p.m. 
during the five days per week thai 
you suggest I "visit" the campus. 

"I do not deny thai many of the 
positions on issues which I 
espouse are radical to many." 
■Mark S. Snyder 

Wrong again, Mr. Willson! My 
administradon did not purchase con- 
doms with "studcnLs' monies" as 
you claimed, so it was not an issue 
of subsidizing "people on this cam- 
pus who warn to screw around" as 
you so poetically described intimate 
scAual behavior. 

I am sorry to have to be the one to 
burst your bubble of ignorance but 
in this counuy ihe majority do not 
rule, as you claim. Women comprise 
the majority in this counuy. They 
will be greatly surprised to learn 
ihai Lhey "rule." 

As 10 the issue of smoking, you 
would deny everyone ihe freedom 
of choice except those wiih whom 
you live as you admitted to living 
with a smoker. I would diink that, 
recardlcss of the cost or personal 
sacrifice to you, you would move as 
it would be a small price to pay 
indeed to save you from "ruining 
your lungs with the intake of car- 
cinogenic compounds." Your siate- 
mcni, however, is typical of the dou- 
ble-standard applied by your ilk. I 
wonder if you were invited to the 
While House to dine with the 
President of ihe United Slates, 
would you refuse to sit at the table 



because the President smoked 

tobacco? 

Mr. Willson claims that his reason 
for being at this campus is "for 
learning and getting an education." 
It is interesting ihai Mr Willson 
makes a distinction between the 
iwo. In fact, I would heanily agree 
to his distinction. One can "get an 
education" without any "learning" 
as Mr. Willson so ably demon- 
strates. 

To Mr. Willson 1 would suggest 
that instead of following me aiound 
the campus to see where I park - 
especially in light of his siaiemeni 
thai he has so hide time lo waste on 
being involved in his campus - thai 
he enroll in the following courses 
before atiempling to write any fur- 
ther leuers advertising his stupidity: 
freshman composition, critical 
thinking, and any sociology course. 

Finally, it is interesting (and sad) 
10 note thai both Mr. Willson and 
"Dong" (undoubtedly a euphemism 
for the name of Richard, the diminu- 
tive of which he obviously is) find 
issues such as homophobia, racism,

"complaining about nothing" as 
they stale. Obviously. Willson and 
"Dong" will be absent from the vot- 
ing booth this November as neither

I wanted to end ihis leaer by sug-

I was going to suggest that he fold it

Unfortunately, however, that partic-

Frat boys 
lose out 
on couch 

To the Editor: 

I am writing regarding the furniture 
problem in ihc Greek lobby. Nol 
only do we at Phi Kappa Theta occu- 
py an office which is smaller than 
most professors' offices, all of the 
furniture in the Greek lobby was 
removed for re-upholstering. The 
furniture was sent over six weeks i 
ago with no dale o;i when the furhi- ■ 
lure will come back. 

When we iricd to move one chair i 
and one couch to help accommodate 
our 25 member organization, we 
were threatened that the furniture., 
would be removed pemianendy. The. 
lounge from which we took the 
couch and the chair has eight couch- 
es and over ten chairs and is uiili/ed 
by less than ten people at any one 
time. We are asking diat the univer- 
sity allow us to have one couch and 
a chair to ease the seating problem 
caused by the removal of the fur- 
niture.

To The Editor: 

I am wriiing in reply lo your staff 
editorial in the Sept. 10 edition of 
The Communicalor. Obviously, your 
in lerp relation of the informaiion age 
is somcwhai dated, because ihc 
Helmke Library is doing a compc- 
icni job of keeping up wiih other 
libr^cs of similar si/e. In case you 
haven't noticed, limes have 
changed, and you can no longer use 
ihe old-fashioned card catalog in 
any local library. Every library has 
computerised their collections in 
some form or another, whether you 
approve of it or not. When was the 
last time the card catalog told you 
that a book was checked out, or 
when it was due, thos saving you a 
trip upstairs lo find out if it was on 
the shell? The 10 system allows you 
to do this firom any VAX terminal on 
campus or from home if you have 
access to a computer. The terminals 
that you believe cost us some books 
are actually funded by the statewide 
10 budgeL 

As a BMS graduate student, and 
also a graduate assistant. I hear the 
same complaint from faculty that 
you put forth for the students, not 
enough information on hand for 
research projects. Due lo the infor- 
mation e:(plosion, most up-to-date 
facts and theories arc contained in 
academic journals, rather than in 
completed books. Unfortunately, 
due to budget constraints, we do not 
have as many of these as we could 
use in our various endeavors. 1 have 
not met many people working on 
their doctoral dissenaiion at this 
campus, but the few I have seen talk 
a lot about going to other libraries lo 
find the things they need. The 
Helmke Library does noi expend all 
o( their resources for doctoral mate- 
rials. The library committee last 
year mandated that more money be 
spent on undergraduate level books 
than on periodicals. The 91-93 bud- 
get includes a special SIOO.OOO allo- 
cation for more books 

Yes studenti do pay the bills Slu 
dent fees bring \n about thirty three 
percent of the annual budget The 
money goes to \Ve^i Lafayette and 
we receive back a line ilem alloca 
uon from die slate budget for fundi 
available for local use Unforlunati, 
ly there is an administrative fee 
attached to everything so this cam 
pus does not receive all the funds

If students would not wait till the 
last minute, then they would not 
have difficulties utilizing the docu- 
ment delivery services. Remember, 
"poor planning on your pari docs 
not constitute an emergency on my 
part," When you know that the 
materials you need might have to be 
ordered, than all you have to do is 
start working on your project in a 
timely fashion. It IS not die respon- 
sibility of the Helmke Library to 
cover up for your inaction in begin- 
ning a term paper too close to the 
deadline. The library is open seven 
days a week, and undl late at night 
on most of dicm. 

Wc deserve bciicr. 

The information sources for the 
90s arc on on-line computers and on 
CD-ROMs. This is a fad. Gel used

are replacing printed materials. 
Some of the items are no longer 
available in a printed format. No 
matter how much you complain the 
old card catalog will not return. You 
have more sources available to you 
now than when I did my undergrad- 
ualc work in the 70s. Il also takes a 
great deal less effort to find this 
information due to the advantages of

Student senate 



IPSGA brand new, 
needs student input 



Over the last few years the stu- 
dent senate has gone through a 
series of scandals thai have 
destroyed its image. These scan- 
dals seem to find themselves con- 
tinuously plaguing die current sen- 
ate. Let's set the record straighL 

The student senate that was sur- 
rounded in two years of scandals 
has been dissolved and a newly 
elected, as well as, appointed gov- 
ernment is now convened. Current 
members have nothing to do with 
the mistakes of die past and have 
spent die first four months in office 
trying to recover from the previous 
year's mistakes. 

1 can not speak for the former 
senate, but let us get something 
clear about this senate. We are not 
lazy bums, "who only take one or 
two classes at a time" then "sit 
back and blow political clinches at 
each odier." We are full time stu- 
dents who care about this universi- 
ty and its student body. We are not 
IPFW's brain trust; we are average 
students who have decided it is 
time to change the image of the 
senate and to bring a lilUe pride 
back to this university. 

The senate is here for the stu- 
dents. We are wUling to help and 
to hear what the students have to 
say. Student senators can only do 
so much without student input. If 
you have comments, suggesuons. 
or complaints then please stop by 



die IPSGA office and talk to a stu- 
dent senator. Simply ignoring die 
problem will not get it resolved. 

The once prestigious senate is 
now thought to be an "infamous 
body of no good lazy bums that 
tries ID find the worst and most idi- 
otic way of spending our money." 
Perhaps the reason the former sen- 
ate was able to do this is because 
of a lack of interest by die student 
body at large. 

The senate needs the student 
body's support in order to remain 
an effective voice on campus. Get 
involved! Join! You don't need a 
lot of time. The senate has room 
for 15 new senators, and die aver- 
age lime needed from diosc sena- 
tors is less than three hours per 
week, and diat is only if you have 
that much time. Your senate has 
thousands of dollars to spend this 
year. Do wc wish to leave that up 
to five people? Even widi the most 
honest of intentions, five senators 
couldn't possibly represent the 
entire student body. 

It is lime to let the past rest and 
to concentrate on die future. 1 of 
course do not speak on behalf of 
die IPSGA or any other member of 
the student senate. However. I do 
feel diis needed to be said so as to 
gel our minds off the past and to 
look forward toward the future.

Stop discrimination 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

There is a pnablem of discrimina- 
tion in the United States. But affir- 
mative action quotas arc not the 

answer. 

Recently, my father was dis- 
cu.wing affirmative action with a co- 
worker. My father said. "A company 
should hire the most qualified appli- 
cant, always. If die the most quali- 

Commentary 

fied is a white male, the company 
should hire him. If iwo applicants 
are equally qualified, Hip a coin, just 
as you would if two white males 
were ctjually qualified." 

The co-worker became very upset 
and said that if a company only 
hired the most qualified, blacks 
would never be hired. 



The co-worker failed to realize 
that his statement, not my father's, 
was racist. He assumed that blacks 
were too stupid to actually qualify 
for a job. 

Even when the two candidates arc 
equally qualified, there is no reason 
to hire a black over a white, a 
woman over a man. Flip a coin. 
Fifty percent should come up on the 
side of ihe minority. 

To automatically give the job to 
the minority is discriminating 
against die majority. 

Discrimination is never justified. Ii 
is bad to have a majority ruling a 
minority. It is downright absurd to 
have a minority ruling a majority. 

There is nodiing wrong widi help- 
ing the underprivileged. But do it 
because they arc underprivileged, 
not because they are black, or 
women, or handicapped, or Hispan- 
ic. Discrimination is never justified.

THROUGH RETIREMENT. 



Think about supporting _voiirsclf for

financial test you'll ever face. Fortunately, 
you have one valuable asset in your 
favor. Time. 

Time lo take advantage of tax-deferral. 
Time for your money to grow. 

But starting early is key. Consider this: 
if vou begin saving just Si do a month at 
age thirty, you can accumulate Si()2.53;i* 
by the time you reach age sixty-five. 
Wait ten years and you'd need to set aside 
Sa27 a month to reach the same goal. 



At TlAA-CREf; we not only under- 
stand the value of starting early, we 
can help make it possible— with flexible 
retirement and tax-deferred annuity 
plans, a diverse portfolio of investment 
choices, and a record of personal

Hey Undecided, get your head out of the oven 



By Tim Schreiber 
Leisure wriler 

li's lime 10 think about your 
career Just what the hell do you 
think you're doing with your life? 

Don't you have a 25 year plan? 
No? Well, what about your len year 
plan? No ten year plan? What kind 
of unmotivated, lazy, gelatinous 
sloth are you? Don't you know thai 
plans are what separate the winners 
from Ike losers? 

Okay, let's plan your life. What's 
your major? You don'l have a 
major?! Welt, quick, pick one! You 
have to have one rigitt now! 

What' II il be? Economics? Engi- 
neering? Education? Poly-Nuclear 
Physics with a dash of 18th Century 
Austrian Cabinet Making? 

If you don't decide soon, someone 
is going to decide for you. His name 
is Bob, and he's the Dean in Charge 
of Deciding Majors for Wishy- 
Washy. Indecisive, Commitment 
Fearing Creampuffs. Hopefully. Bob 
will be in a good mood when decid- 
ing your fate. Some days, though, 
he forgets his daily helping of bran 
and sentences some pitiful Unde- 
cided student to something like Hair 
Design or Face-Lift An. The siu- 
deni then spends the rest of his or 
her life wondering the streets, or, 
even worse, becomes a game show 
host . . . 

So goes the plight of the Undecid- 
ed studcni. *He wanders around 
campus with a dazed and confused 
look on his face. looking for any 
kind of sign thai will guide him into 
ihe appropriate career. Perhaps a 
band of light shining down upon 
him, wiUi angels singing, and a deep 



resounding voice insiruciing, "You 
want lo be a Podiairist, Now

and be 

happy." 

Unfor- 
tunate- 
ly for 
the 
Unde- 
cided, 
[his 
rarely 
hap- 
pens. 

And when it does, it is usually a 
simple case of a drug - or stress - 
induced hallucination. So the poor 
Undccideds have to reson to sam- 
pling a variety of classes, finding 
some interests, and deciding on 
something that they want to do for 
the rest of their life until they're 
dead. 

It's a tough decision. And it 
doesn't help that everyone else 
seems to know exactly what he 
wants and where he is going. 

(*By using the pronoun "he," 1 am 
not implying that alt Undecideds arc 
male. There are plenty of Undecided 
females, I'm sure. And I'm making 
no effort to slight females by using 
'■he," "him," or "his" in my Unde- 
cided example. The thing is, we 
don't have a word in our language 
for a third person singular thai could 
be either male or female. I suppose I 
could use "it." bul this may offend 
many Undecideds. On behalf of the 
English language, 1 apologize lo all 



the feminists out there with flaming 
arrows. I'm just a slave to my insuf- 
licicnl language.) 

1 have no qualms admitting that 1 
have a history of Undecidedness. 
Hi, my name is Tim. and I'm a 
recovering Undecided. See? 

When I was Undecided, die thing 
[hat bugged me most was being 
asked, "What's your major?" I'm 
convinced that this is the most com- 
monly asked question of college 
students. As opposed to the most 
commonly asked question by col- 
lege students, which is, of course, 
"Is this going to be on the test?" 

When you are an Undecided, it 
seems you can't swing a dead cat 
without hitting some schmuck who 
wants to know what you're planning 
to do with your life. "What's your 
Major" is the champion small talk 
question on American campuses; 
the precursor to the real-life ques- 
Lon, "What do you do for a liv- 
ing?" 

Everyone, Undecided or not. will 
be asked these questions at least 387 
times in his or her life. Even when 
you know the answer, it can get tir- 
ing. You feel like a broken record, 
"Accounting with a minor in 
Physics . . . Accounting with a 
minor in Physics . . . Accounting 
with a minor in Physics , , ," or "I 
supervise loiicry drawings on local 
TV. ... I supervise lottery draw- 
ings on local T.V. . , . etc," 

In this respect, the Total Undecid- 
ed has a slight advantage over the 
Partial Undecided. It is much quick- 
er and easier to say "I don't have 
one," then ii is to say, "Well, techni- 
cally, it's Biology, but I'm in the

process of changing lo Political Sci- 
ence, If thai doesn 'I workout, I may 
go back to my founh major, which 
was Modem Dance ..." 

I iry to be creative with my 
answers, so il doesn't gci loo tiring. 
For instance, my major is English. I 
don'l know what ihe hell I'm going 
to do with it, bul ihai's it. When 
people ask me what 1 plan to do 
with my life, I answer, "I want lo be 
an anisl, lo creaic. lo sing, to dance. 
to frolic, lo laugh, to cry (insert 
"Bom Free" here), lo write!" They 
usually jusi smile and nod and then 
go away. 

Sometimes people will ask "What 
are you studying?" This is a much 
more open-ended qucsUon, and can 
be answered wiih. "I'm studying 
Satanic indo-fracturomaiic indifibu- 
lums. I'd explain more about it, but 
then I'd have lo kill you." This 
response usually ends the conversa- 
tion abruptly. 

Earlier I made a distinction 
between Total and Partial Undecid- 
eds. I ihink most college students 
are Partially Undecided. There is a 
litiJc Undecided lurking within all 
of us, just wailing to pop out and 
tell us 10 abandon our previous 
plans 10 become a Rockette, or 
something like thaL 

1 have siatisiics to back up my 
claim. They say that the average 
college sludeni changes his or her 
major something like 2.5 limes in 
his or her career. (I don'i know who 
Ihe omniscient "They" are, but ihey 
sure are full of neat facts, arcn'i 
they?) This proves thai, on the aver- 
age, we don't know whai we wanL 
We're just a bunch of wafflers. 



Oh, 1 know ihcrc are those excep- 
tions where someone was fed some 
sort of strange chemical in his Ger- 
bers and consequently knew what he 
wanted with his life before he could 
control his bladder. But these are 
rare cases, and you should remem- 
ber that these people aren't really 
happy with their choice, they jusl 
think they are. Besides, in ten years. 
they'll have a change of heart and be 
locked into their career and miser- 
able, trying to buy happiness with 
fast cars and bad toupees. 

By then, we Undecideds will still 
have plenty of options open lo us, 
and 837 credii hours to boot. 

In fact, as young people entering 
the real world, it is our privilege, 
nay, our duty, to be confused about 



ihe future, Wc owe ii to the older 
generaiions to dawdle around, trying 
10 "find ourselves." so they can call 
us lazy and unmotivated and feel 
smug about how much more respon- 
sible they were ai our age. "By 
golly, when 1 was your age, 1 had 
direction," They love gloating 
about such things. 

So don'l worry about not having a 
major, or not being sure about your 
major. You don't have to decide 
right now, and no one is going to 
decide for you. 

It will come. 

And when it does, ihe world will 
still be here, ready lo beat down 
your dreams with big splintery 
clubs.

So you want to know what's really hot? 
Classroom Medical could boil up rice 



By Jim Walker 
Edilor in Chief 

Hello from Hades. Wha[ you arc 
jusl aboul to Slop reading here is one 
of ihosc puny '"Mini-Angles" ihai 
are so dam small ihat ihe picture of 
my goofy disembodied head won'l 
even fil. 

Disappointing huh? 

Well, don'l cry you babies. Just 
rela:(, breathe deeply, shut your eyes 
and picture in your mind my column 
photo. Hey, stop that! I don't look 
anything like Sharon Stone without 
her shirt 

CLASSROOM MEDICAL 
HELL - I've lost 37 pounds since 
this semester started. Stairmastering? 
You ask. No. no, 1 haven't lifted my 
while ass off the sofa in months, 
ej(ccpl to go to class once in a while. 



Mini - Angle 



And oddly enough, class is where 
I've been shedding my fatty tissue. 
That's right, I too spend my 
evenings in CM sauna. 

CM's that cinder block bunker 
over by the library. You know, [hat 
building that is so hot inside you 
come out of it all glassy and warped 
like a fresh baked Shrinky Dink. 

One cool prof of mine brings a 
small electric fan with him to class. 
Nice try sir, but it doesn't do much 
to cool the students. But it does 
vibrate ever so gently, relaxing us all 
into a fitful slumber. 

What can be done about the lack of 
breathable air in the dreaded CM 
building? Nothing. Last year, several 
students dropped dead and nothing 
was done. 



They just hauled the corpses up to 
the fourth floor and used them for 
dissections.

Veteran K's begin 1992-93 run for IHL's Grey Cup P\X7BNi™89i^ 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Edilor 

After being eliminated from the 
IHL playoffs in ihe Crsi round last 
year by the Kiilamazoo Wings, Fori 
Wayne's Komeis are bent on 
vengeance and looking for a league 
championship. 

The Komets captured the IHL 
eastern division regular season 
crown for 1991-1992 with a record 
of 52-22-8 but fell to their nonhcm 
rivals early in the playoffs. 

Kernel President Micheal Frankc 
has higher hopes for the 1992-93 
squad. 

"Quite frankly, our goal is to win 
it all," said Franke, "Anything else 
will not satisfy us. Our c^ipectations 
arc very high. We have a very 
strong nucleus of veteran players 
returning plus we've added a num- 
ber of free agents during the sum- 
mer. 

The Komets, who have secondary 
affiliations with the Detroit Red 
Wings and Winnepeg Jets of the 
National Hockey League, open the 
season against their southern rivals, 
the Indianapolis Ice, Oct. 9 and 10 
at the Coliseum, Both weekend 




An early exit Trom Ihe 1992 playofTs has motivated the Komets to train 
hard in the ofT-season. Photo courtesy of Ihe Komets. 



games are set to begin at 8 p.m. and 
should be exciting, according to 
Tom Weiscnbach, the public rela- 
tions director of the Ice. 

"It's a great rivalry. We play each 
other quite often," said Weiscnbach. 
"The players take it up another 
notch. They play tougher and hard- 
er thanks to the support of the fans." 

The Ice, who won the IHL's 
Turner Cup in 1990, languished in 
the basement of the eastern division 
last season, finishing at 31-41-10. 
The Ice, who arc affiliated with the 



Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL, 
return a number of veterans and a 
few highly touted new-airivals from 
the Western Hockey League. 

"We'll have more speed and 
quickness this year and hopefully 
score more goats. Scoring was our 
weakness last year." said 
Weiscnbach, "Our defense was 
solid." 

The Komeis return several veter- 
ans hut have not rested on their lau- 
rels in the ofT-scason. 

Igor Chibircv, a center who spent 



season leadi 
Commonwealth of Independent 
States Elite League in scoring, will 
be the first Russian to spend a full 
season in ihe Fon Wayne organiza- 
tion. 

The Komets boast a number of 
players under contract with the 
NHL. including Max Middcndorf, 
Kory Kocur. Gui DuPais and Kelly 
Hurd- 

The Komeis announced a two year 
contract extension of their lease with 
the Coliseum last month, extending 
their lease through July 31, 1995. 
According to Franke. "The coniract 
extension is just another sign of how 
well the Komeis and Coliseum have 
become working partners over the 
past two years."

Divisional realignment, league 
expansion, new restrictions on fight- 
ing, and a woman goalie highlight 
the changes in the International 
Hockey Uaguc for the 1992-1993 
season. 

The IHL now boasts a league- 
record 12 franchises with a pair of 
new arrivals to the league. Atlanta is 
the sole expansion club and is an 
affiliate of one of the NHL's new 
arrivals, the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
The Cincinnati Cyclones come to the 
IHL from the East Coast Hockey 
League and led minor league hockey 
in attendance in 1991-1992, filling 
9,500 seats per game. 

Muskegon closed its doors but has 
iropened in Cleveland and will play 
at Richfield Coliseum, the home of 
the NBA's Cavaliers, Muskegon 
look second place in the eastern divi- 
sion last season with a regular season 
record of41-28-]3. 

Andy McGowan, the IHL's director 
of media relations, is pleased with 
the expansion and relocation. 

"This has helped the league a great 
deal. These teams are great additions 
to the league," said McGowan, 
"We've expanded into major market 
places." 

The new expansion led to the 
realignment of the conferences and 
divisions of the IHL, placing Fon 
Wayne's Komets in the central divi- 
sion of the eastern conference. The 
Komeis will now compete for thcii 
division crown against regional 
rivals Indianapolis and Kalamazoo. 

The IHL has taken a new stance 
against on-ice fisticuffs, following 
the lead of the NHL, Fighi instiga- 
tion will still carry a two-minute 
minor penalty but will now include a 
game misconduct penalty, disqualify- 
ing the fight instigator from the con-

test. The rclaliaior will be given a 
five minute major penalty, as 
before. 

According to McGowan, it will be 
up to the IHL's crack force of offi- 
cials to enforce diis strict policy on 
fighting. The NHL trains, supervis- 
es and evaluates referees for the 
international league, while linesmen 
fall under the jurisdiction of the IHL 
commissioner's office headed by 
Commissioner Thomas Berry. 

The commissioner's office has 
indicated, in a memo on Sept. 23, 
that these new standards "arc to be 
strict and the commissioner has 
issued a strong mandate," 



The league that helped propel 
Goalie Ed Belfour of the 

Blackhawks and Quebec Goalie Ron 
Hcxiall to stardom has a new twist 
on the up and coming nctmindcr 

Manon Rheumc, who became the 
NHL's first woman player two 
weeks ago with a slart in goal 
against Sl Louis, became the IHL's 
first lady of goaliending last week 
after being assigned to Atlanta by 
the Tampa Bay Lighming. Rheume. 
a native of Canada, signed an NHL 
contract with the Lightning on 
Monday and began pracdcing in the 
crease with the Knights on Tuesday. 



"She has played quite well so far," 
said McGowan of Rheumc's 
progress. 

The Komets Micheal Frankc is 
excited but a little apprehensive 
about this progress. "1 hope she 
plays in both home and away 
games," said the club president, 
"Just playing home games would 
defeat the purpose of what she's 
doing. It would make it a circus," 

The Knights will visii Fon Wayne ' 
during the second Komct homesiand 
of the season, OcL 23 and 24. 

The 1992-93 IHL All-Star game 
wilt be held in Phoenix on Feb. 2, 
1993.

THE COMMUNICATOR 



"niursday.Octobcr 1.1992 



Lat pull down back in action 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

A poieniially hazardous exercise 
machine has been repaired in the 
weight room at the Gates Sports 
Center, but is slill slated for replace- 
mem. 

The high pulley-low pulley, or Hi- 
Lo, a machine ihai o^crcises the 
back muscles through cither a lai 
pulldown or a seated row, had an 
extra pulley attached to allow the 
weight stack perfect vertical movc- 
mcnl. 

The Hi-Lo was highlighted in the 
ScpL 10 issue of The Communicator 
in the IPFW Sports Spoilighi column 

IPFW Sports 
Spotlight 

as being unsafe and in poor operat- 
ing condition. 

The Hi-Lo had been scheduled for 
this repair as far back as July, but at 
the time of ihe writing of the article 
had not been repaired 

Cheryl Pasko. the manager of the 
Gates Sports Center, is currently 
assessing the needs of the exercise 
room, and then will put a proposal 
together to present to Richard 
Ritchie, the Vice Chancellor of 
Financial Affairs. 

According to Pasko a new seated 
lat pull will be at the top of this list, 
along with a calf machine, a resur- 
faced floor and a military bench 
press. 

"I want to spend the necessary 
funds to buy a new (sealed lat pull) 
machine. The Hi-Lo was purchased 
several years ago and was bought 
cheaply. Ii is more for home use than 
commercial applications," Pasko 
said. 

The calf machine, along with the 
Hi-Lo was purchased through the, 
now bankrupt, Prince Company. 

Pasko ranks the seated lat pull 
from Heartlinc as a good candidate 
to replace the Hi-Lo. "It comes with 
a good warranty and a good service 
contract. Wc need a heavy duty 
model," Pasko said. 

The Hcarrline model will not have 
the added capability of a seated row 
as the old Prince model did. 

However. Pasko points out that 
two Nautilus machines in the Gates 
Sports Center will simulate the same 
exercise. 

'The super pullover and the row- 
ing machine allow you to use the 
same muscle groups, and we don't 
have the floor room for a machine 
that does a row and a pulldown," 
Pasko said. 

The new lat pulldown alone could 
cost up to S1800. For this reason. 



Pasko believes it could be six 

months before the funds for the new 
equipment are approved and it is 
purchased and installed. 

Meanwhile, Pasko has dipped imo 
ihe special account for maintenance 
and repairs for the Gales Sports 
Center to install the pulley and pur- 
chase the weights to repair the Hi- 
U. 

"There is hardly ever enough to 
make ends meet." Pasko said. 

"I decided over the weekend to go 
ahead and replace the weights on the 
Hi-Lo. I want to keep the students 
happy, they arc our customers. But I 
won't repair it again. It will be out 
the door." 

Pasko estimated the Hi-Lo will be 
back in use in about a week, depend- 
ing on the Physical Plant schedule. 
The Physical Plant will install the 
weights. 

Pasko said she realized the incon- 
venience of having the Hi-Lo out of 
service, but puts the safety of the 
students first. 

"If a machine goes down, an out of 
order sign is immediately placed on 
it," Pasko said. 

Some confusion over the safety of 
the Hi-Lo allowed students to use 
the machine after the weights had 
been cracked, but when notified of 
the problem, Pasko did not hesitate 
to close it down. 

Pasko performs a monthly piece- 
by- piece audit of the exercise room 
that ratcly lasts less than two hours. 
A SK 10 twelve point check inspects 
chains, spnxkets, pulleys, bushings, 
cushions and much more. 

Safely first, then convenience, 
marks the attitude of the Gates 
Sports Center personnel. 



IPFW biathlon draws 102 
participants in first year 



By Joe Heersche 

Sports Editor 

The first annual IPFW "Fall 

Into Fitness" Biathlon was held 

Sunday, Sept. 20, at the IPFW 

campus. 

The biathlon, consisting of a 20 
mile bike ride that snaked its way 
through St. Joe Township, and a 

"/ hoped for 100 people." 
-Cheryl Pasko, 
event coordinator 

5K run, attracted 102 participants. 

Cheryl Pasko, ihe event coordi- 
nator, was pleased with the turn 
out. "I hoped for 100 people," 
Pasko said. 

The biathlon replaces last 
year's triathlon that attracted con- 
siderably less participants due to 
die canoe leg of the competition, 
"There arc not many good nawers 
in this area I found out. and the 
river didn't cooperate last year, " 
Pasko said. 

This year's event consisted of 
both male and female individual 
competition in four age brackets; 
18-25: 26-39: 40-54: and 5S-up. 
Also, team competition took 
place in all-male, all-female, and 
mixed teams, 

Paul Kucharski won the 18-25 
bracket, but was bested overall by 
26-39 bracket winner, Ken 
Babcock. Babcock's time of 



1:11:32 was five seconds faster 
than Kucharski's. 

Rounding out the men's compe- 
tition winners was Dan Fineran at 
1:15:35 in the 40-54 bracket, and 
David Wilson in the 55-up group. 

The female winner with the best 
lime was Kim Larson at 1:24:19 
in the 26-39 bracket 

Erica Dekko finished first in the 
18-25 bracket with a time of 
1:39:47, and Julia Wilson in the 
40-54 bracket scored a first with 
1:47:16 time. There were no 
female competitors in ihe 55-up 
group. 

The team winners were: all- 
male masters, Dave Elliott and 
Sieve Elliott; all-male, Scott 
Schumann and Jay Gilbert; all- 
female masters. Joan Gary and 
Betty Gary; all-female, Ann 
Fremon and Margart North; 
mixed-masters, Alan Bradley and 
Barb Scrogram; mixed, Lisa 
Kraizen and Matt Lewis. 

In other intramural news, the 
sand volleyball tournament, held 
on Saturday, Sept. 26, saw the 
Silica Spikcrs defeat the Dig 
Heads in two games, 15-3 and 15- 
8. 

The Silica Spikcrs were repre- 
sented by Matt Metzgcr. Shea 
Shimasari, Shelly Landis, Heather 
Bradford, and Larry Klcber.
