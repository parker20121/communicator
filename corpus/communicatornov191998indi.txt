Citizens Action wants to inform voters about finance reform 



Chief Reporier 

Members of the Ciiizens Action 
CtxiUlion's Educaiion Fund (CACKF) met 
with aiea citizens last Friday to discuss the 
issue of campaign finance refoim. 

CACEF hopes lo gel ciiiuins inforaied 
and work wiiti the Indiana Legislatuic to 
improve this Lssuc. 

"We want to set citizens educated and 
talking about these issues," CACEF Project 
Coordinator Julia Vaughn said. "If we can 
give people a better base of infonnalion, 
ihcy can become advocates in their own 
area— we want people lo take specific 
stands on campaign financing." 

Ten sites throughout hidiana have been 



used by CACEF for public hearings about 
campaign finance reform. 

Random telephone polling has also 
been used to gather public opinion of Ibis 
issue. 

"This is an issue that citizens must take 
the lead on," Vaughn said. "If people are 
better educated and understand the issue, 
they will be able to approach legislators 
more effectively." 

According to Vaughn, even though elec- 
tions are over, the opponuniiy to make 
changes through Indiana's General 
Assembly is noL Tbc legislators will not 
ofTicially convene again until January. 

"We need people talking (o their legisla- 
tors now — months before the General 
Assembly gets together," Vaughn said. 



"legislators will be more sensitive to peo- 
ple in their own districts than to the CACEF 
in general." 

Some of the goals set forth by CACEF 
at the meeting were to gel elections equally 
competitive, restore public confidence in 
politics, inaea.se the number of citizens vot- 
ing, and give those running for political 
offices more time lo discuss important cur- 
rent issues, 

"If people have confidence in the elec- 
toral process, ihey are more likely to vote," 
said CAC Legislative Director John 
Caldwell. "Hopefully we can make a sys- 
tem that will leave candidates more time to 
focus on the issues." 

Cardwcll pointed out that in 50 districts 
in Indiana, candidates ran unopposed. 



This is often a result of the high costs of 
running a political campaign for positions 
that pay very little in comparison. 

"It seems that we elect people based on 
their ability lo raise rund.s." said Fourth 
District Reform Party Representative 
Nor\is Hill. "I think that lax payers may he 
interested in doing something together (to 
make changes) because usually they are not 
represented." 

One possibility discussed was bringing 
back the tax credit for individuals who want 
to contribute to a candidate's political 
campaign. 

Only 4 percent of Indiana citizens 
presendy give Individually to political can- 
didates' campaigns. 

The possibility of limiting the amount 



of money that labor unions and corporations 
can donate to campaigns was also dis- 
cussed. 

In Indiana, PACS are not limited to the 
amount they can donate, although in other 
states, this is not always allowed. 

"Special interest groups are the main 
funders (of political campaigns) in our 
state," Vaughn said. "CACEF wants to give 
citizens some ideas on how changes could 
be made." 

For more information or to gel 
involved, the Citizens Action Coalition can 
be contacted ai 423-4492, 

A copy of the report on the A copy 
statewide public hearings of June and July 
can also be obtained from the CAC.

American Indians Inonored during November 

by Carrie Lealhers 



Chief Reporter 

Through the efforts of presi- 
dents George Bush and Bill Clinton, 
November ha.&lt;, been set aside as 
National American Indian Heritage 
Month in recognition of the nations 
of people here long before the 
Europeans. 

"At this momentous ume, we 
pay tribute to this country's first 
pcoples-lhe American Indians." 
Clinton slated in a proclamation in 
1994 

"We celebrate ihe innumerable 
contributions that generations of 
American Indians and Alaska 
Natives have made to our country 
and 10 our world." 

Most United Stales citizens are 
unaware of how poorly Ihe indige- 
nous peoples were treated by early 
Europeans and even well into the 
present century. 

In 1992. Bobby Castillo of the 
American Indian Movement (AIM) 
spoke to I&gt;iaiiibc magazine aboul 




Tecumwah Recreation Center cel- 
ebrates heritage of local tribes 



this [H'oblcm. 

"I don't think you can build for 
a better future by teaching hes and 
disU)riions." Castillo said. 

"Every one of our societies has 



done something wrong. What's 
wrong with facing the wrongs that 
we've done? You look at the wrongs 
and you correct it Build a future. 
But 1 think we've got to look at 
those things." 

Early on, according to Louis 
Cantor, professor of history, the 
native cultures in America were not 
recognized accurately. 

"Pan of the problem was the 
U.S. government saw them as a for- 
eign enemy," Cantor said. 

"We negotiated treaties with 
them just as we would with a for- 
eign country." 

Strategies taken by the U.S. war 
department included kilUng as many 
Indians as possible. 

On the other hand, Ihe Bureau 
of Indian Affairs dealt with the 
Indians as though they needed to be 
made into while American farmers. 

Both viewpoints ignored the 
culiu[e.s and beliefs of the American 
Indians. 

Not until the New Deal, under 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
were American Indians finally given 



encouragement to pursue tribal cus- 
toms and cullures. 

National American Indian 
Heritage Month is an additional 
siep towards recognizing the impor- 
tance and beauty of native American 
cultures. 

"Native peoples were the first 
environmentalists, understanding 
that air. water, plants, and animals 
must be treated with respect if they 
are to remain available for genera- 
Lons to come," Clinton said. 

"American Indians taught the 
first European settlers how to sur- 
vive in new surroundings and 
helped them to explore uncharted 
wilderness." 

In 1994 CUnton said that he 
would like to see the entire nation 

observe this month. 

"I urge all Americans, as well as 
their elected representatives at the 
federal, state, and local levels, to 
observe this month with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activi- 
ties," Clinton said. 



United Sexualities 
to crown first 
'Miss Gay IPFW 



by Carrie Lenlhers 



Chief Reporter 

United Sexualities will be pre- 
senting IPFW's first "Miss Gay 
IPE^" Pageant this Sunday from 6- 
9:30 p.m. in the Walb Union 
Ballroom. 

Although five drag shows have 
been held at IPFW in the past two 
andahalfyears, this will be the first 
competitive show. 

"Most people come to watch for 
the first time just out of curiosity," 
said Todd King, benefit coordinator 
"Usually d)js is something people 
have only seen on talk shows, but 
IPFW is a place to go where people 
don't have to feel uncomfortable." 

King noted that this is generally 
somcdiing found only in gay bars, 
but by being at IPFW, the pageant 
caters to an audience that does not 
have lo be 21 or gay to get in, 

'There are three other universi- 
ties in Indiana that do this." King 
said, "We give all the proceeds to 
United Sexualities — this is mainly 
just a fundraiser." 

The pageant will feature three 
caiegones, and twelve men from 



Allen County and surrounding 
counties will make up the pageant's 
contestants. 

The contestants will first appear 
as themselves, some possibly 
dressed in suits and sporting beards 
and mustaches. 

Tlicn, when they reappear on 
stage, they will be In full drag. 
facial hair shaved off, and ready for 
the talent portion of the pageant. 

According to King, the talent 
portion will involve an upbeat song 
and dance for each contestant. 

Following the talent portion, the 
coniestanLs will appear in their drag 
evening wear and will perform 
another song, most likely a ballad. 

To King's knowledge, the con- 
testants will only be Up-syncing. 

In March, as part of the conclu- 
sion of Cyber City week. United 
Sexualities will be holding another 
pageant for fundraising. 

Tickets can be purchased in 
advance for S5 at After Dark or by

What's Weak this week 



by Deddy Hidayai Jong -Ediwrial Canoonhi 



Staff Editorial 



Topic: 

IPFW Autobahn and 
Student parking 

What we think: 

Slow it down and 
take your time. 



Everyone knows Ihai parking 
at IPFW has always been a prob- 
lem, bul do we really need lo 
make it worse by driving at 
break-neck speeds lo find a spot? 

Just a few days ago one of the 
members of our staff was almost 
in an accident wiih another stu- 
dent. The student was zooming 
from row lo row to find the clos- 
est spot that he could. 

The staff member has a small 
car and the idiot who was driving 
too fast almost didn't see his car, 
swerved towards it and almost hit 
him. 

Another staff member was 
almost in an accident about a 



week ago with an unnamed. 
marked campus vehicle. The 
offending vehicle was heading 
the wrong way out of a parking 
garage while our staffer was 
lieading in. 

This could have made for a 
lethaf combination if both 
weren't totally aware of what was 
going on. Luckily, neither was 
hurt. These are just a few of the 
stories thai we have regarding the 
traffic around campus. 

People, this isn't the 
Autobahn. There are speed limits 
on this campus. Yes, some of 
them are unusually slow, but 
there is no reason lo jeopardize 
the life and properly of others 
while you are on campus. There 
are always people coming and 
going on campus. There's no rea- 
son to drive around this campus 
like a bunch of idiots. 

Many of the problems with 
driving on this campus have to do 
with ihe structure of the parking 
system. Are there not enough 
spots to go around, or are we just 
being too lazy by trying to find 
the closest spot? We ihink that it 



may be the latter ol the two 

There are plenty of parking 
spots out by the Gates Sports 
Center all day long. There are 
plenty of faculty and metered 
parking spots available in the 
new parking garage. They are 
never full. 

Why don'l we all try jusl find^ 
ing a parking spot wherever one 
is available. It really doesn't take 
that much effort lo go to the back 
of the lot and park instead of fol- 
lowing everyone else to the front 
of the lots. For most of us, we can 
probably use the extra exercise. 
Try it for a week, and you'll lose 
the weight. 



"The car has become a 
secular sanctuary for the 
individual, his shrine to the 
self, his mobile Walden 
Pond." 

-Edward McDonagh

Whai's up Iraq? Do you warn us to 
destroy your cities, kill your innocent 
citizens, desiroy your oil fields ? I 
mean, wbat is Ihe deal? 

If I could talk to Hussein, man-io- 
coward, I would have a hard time 
keeping a straigtil face. 1 would lell 
him that besides the few that suppoit 
bim in Iraq, the rest of ihe world can 
live without him. In fact, he is belter 
off dead. 

We can only hope that there will 
be a revolution, (backed by the U.S. of 
course) that will ovcnhrow his 
regime, kill him. and then the world, 
especially the Middle East, will be 
safe again. 

I'm sure something will happen to 
him this time. Is [he CIA even going 
after him? Maybe we should send 
Slallone over there. 

I noticed that there is a "rapper" 
playing for the Fury this year. 
Marketing? Maybe, we'll see if he is a 
real basketball player or not. The guy 
has nothing to lose. I wish him and the 
rest of the Fury "Good luck." 

By they way, the first game is 
tomorrow night, I hope that a lot of 
people will go and support them. This 
city embarrassed me when it came to 
the baseball season. 

The Wizards made the playoffs, 
the Budweiser was only 50 cents, and 
only 600 people showed up. How 
embarrassing. Don't give me (hat 
"hockey town" crap either. 

Real fans support the local teams; 
ALL of them. If you were there, the 
players tJ)ank you. I miss baseball, can 
you lell? 

Hey Notre Dame, the 8-1 record 
looks pretty good, They could t&gt;e 5-4 
just the same I love the Irish, but they 
sure make me nervous. They arc play- 
ing with a lot of heart this year, 

1 still think they have a shot at a 
national championship in the next 
couple of years. 

The class coming in is supposed to 
be one of the best they have had in 
at&gt;oui 10 years. I hope and'pray that 
they don'l jom Ihe Big Ten, Noire 
Dame vs, Minnesota just doesn't 
sound right. 

The Old Oaken Bucket game this 
weekend, go Hoosiers! I'm sure 
Purdue has a better chance of winning. 
but being a fan is what it is all about, 
right? 

Thanksgiving is coming up next 
week. All of my family lives in 
Florida so obviously I'll be spending 
the holiday with my wife's parents in 
Indy. 

1 miss spending Thanksgiving with 
my folks. And yes. my Mom is the best 
cook in the world. Thanksgiving is a 
great holiday except for those who 
have no one to spend it with. 

Do your soul a favor and kick in 
about five or ten bucks to the charity 
of your choice. Help feed some 
people. 

And don't tell anyone; just do it 
for yourself You will feel great, trust 
me. Maybe even volunteer ai a local 
kitchen. 

How come parents dress twins and 
triplets alike? Doesn't this totally lake 
away a child's identity? It's cute for 
about thee months, then it gets a little 
ridiculous. I mean, are you trying to 
confuse them, or other people, or is it 
a fashion staiemenf 

Speaking of children, do parents 
have to set their children on counter- 
tops where food is being served? 1 see 
this at public places all over town. 
including banks and supermarkeis. 

This is unhealthy and just gross, 
and yes, when I see this occur, I say 
something. 

I don'l have anything else left but 
finals. All of our tests should be fin- 
ished by now, just a paper or two left, 
maybe a speech. Has this semester 
cruised or what? It feels like finals are 
less than a month away-wait a minute, 
they arc. 

I haven't even registered yet for 
next semester. I have no money You 
have to have money to get an educa- 
tion, to gel a Job, to pay for your 
school Vicious cycle isn'i it? 

Again, could the clocks on campus 
all be set on the same time for Pete's 
sake? Is it something difficult, would 
you like me to do it? I have some time 
next week. 

And I'm glad my professors read 
my column. 1 have been able to actual- 
ly relax between classes, use the 
resiroom, get something to drink, have 
a smoke, etc. 

Thanks Bill! (I think the only peo- 
ple that'll get this are in my V371 
class!) 

I saw Joe Clark speak a couple of 
weeks ago. If you missed it, you real-

ly missed ii. He was the guy they 
based the movie "Lean On Me" on 
with Morgan Freeman back in the 80s. 

Talk about energy and a vision. 
This guy was amazing. Speaking of 
lectures, you know they're free, and 
you should try and get as much culture 
as you can. We are supposed to be the 
tolerant generation. 

Let's act like it. By the way. Spike 
Lee will be here in March, I'll be 
there, will you? 

Speaking of tolerance, there are a 
lot of diversified student organisations 
out iherc on campus, I'll have more on 
student organizations later. 

But if you feel bored with your 
current friends, or you're a little shy. 
and you need an outlet to be with peo- 
ple you think arc like you, or if you 
would just like to meet some new peo- 
ple, call Multicultural Services or stop 
by the Union. 

You've been to the Union right? 
Ping-Pong, billiards, comfy sofas, TV. 
food, and you can cash checks over 
there loo. With proper ID of course. 

Loser of the Week: People who eat in 
class. Could you he a little more rude? 
At least open the plastic up before 
class starts. 

None of us want to hear you 
crunching on Frito's as we are taking 
notes. 

I know I'm anal about this, but it's 
jusl a matter of common courtesy 
towards the profs and your fellow stu- 
dents. 

Also, if you must cat. throw your 
garbage away, and please, please recy- 
cle your cans and bottles. Be nice, 
have a great weekend.

Birth of a Hero, Part One: The Great Feast 



Features Editor 

Tirin pulled his blanket lighter 
around bim as ibe wind blew anoth- 
er fierce howl. The days had become 
shorter and ihe weather chillier as 
harvest season had nearly come to a 
close. 

All that remained was the Great 
Feast, he ihoughi to himselT, and 
soon life would become dormant for 
a great while as Ibe snow would 
soon fall. 

Relocating himself to the now 
vacated campfire, he tried to keep 
warm as he watched his people pre- 
pare for the Great Feast 

The Great Feast, as he was quick 
to gather in his ten years, went as far 
bac k as his people's 
history. 

Since Tirin lived during the time 
before the Europeans spread their 
disease and waged their wars 
against the natives of North 
America his people were permitted 
10 be very close to the land and 
worked the warmer pan of the year 
to reap its benefits, 

The Great feast was the crown- 
ing event of the year, as it was when 
everything they bad worked towards 
was broughl to a close for four more 
months. 

It followed Ihe harvesting of the 
com and other crops and was hut a 
few short weeks after the ceasing of 
hostiliiies between the tribes for that 
year 

It was a lime of celebration that 
often lasted for days. His people 
were always big on ce legations, 
and none could top Ihe one they had 
preceding ihe bitter winter. 

This year's feast was going to be 
vKy different for the people of his 
village, though. 

Their chief, Saumou had been 
taken in the last fighting of the year 
with a local tribe, dying Ibe death of 
a wanior. 

Tlie man who took his place was 
indeed a natural leader, having 



fought with valor at die side of 
Saumoi until his death, but Tirin 
couldn't help but miss Saumot. 

He was noi only the leader of 
the Azous but the father as well. He 
was one of the most caring people 
Tirin had ever met. 

Ramosca, his replacement, was 
indeed a good replacement, though. 
He was elected, according to cus- 
tom, by the men of the \illage just 
hours after Saumot fell and the 
Azous emerged victorious over iheir 



It was a unanimous vote, and 
everyone, including Tirin. had the 
utmost faith in their newly appoint- 
ed chief It was the beginning of a 
new era for the Azous. 

Tuin poked at the fire with a stick 
he found as he developed a fixation 
on the orange burning flames thai 
engulfed the wood. 

Seeing his friend poking aim- 
lessly ai the fu'e, Billoka walked 
over from his former recreation and 
to(A a seat nent to him 

Siding in peace. Billoka broke 
the silence witli ,ihe boopi, of ,his, 
voice. "Almost time for Ihe Great 
Feast. Tirin," Bilioka said 
with noted antic ipation. 

Breaking hLs fu on the flames. 
Tirin looked up to see his fnend at 
his side. "Ob. hello Bilioka. How is 
everything goingT' 

"Pretty good, 1 ihink," Bilioka 
said as he picked up a stick and 
joined his friend stirring a log, 
"How iseverydiing with you?" 

"Not loo bad, I'd say. Just think- 
ing about things" 

"What things?" Bilioka said with 
curiosity in his voice. 

"Oh. just little things 1 guess." 
Tirin paused and stared into ihe fire, 
trying to find the right words and the 
sirengih to use them. "Things aren't 
going to be the same this year with- 
out Saumot, you knowT' 

"Yeah. I know," Bilioka replied. 
"It's definitely not going to be the 
same," 

"Do you think he's happy where 
he is now?" 



"Yes, I'd say he is. He was a great 
person, and to great people go great 
things." 

"1 guess," Tuin said, unsure about 
his friend's last staicmeni. "I guess 
I'm just worried that maybe 
Ramosca isn't going to be as good a 
chief as Saumot was. Only time will 
tell, though." 

Tirin threw his stick in the fire 
and watched it as ii burned. Turning 
to his friend, he pushed him down 
and began to wrestle with him, 

Soundly beating him, Tirin pat- 
ted Bilioka on the back and the two 
turned back to their previous 
engagement with the fire. 

"Can 1 ask you something. 
Tirin?" 

"Sure, go ahead Bilioka." 
"Ever wonder what things are 
going to be like when we're allowed 
to hunt with the other men?" 

"Yeah, sometimes 1 do. I'm real- 
ly looking forward to it, to be hon- 
est. It sounds like a lot of fun." 

"What about when we're old 
enough to go inio battle like Saumot 
and RamoscaT' 

"That sounds like fun, too." 
"You aren't worried about get- 
ting hunT' 

"Why worry about ii if it isn't 
going to happen? I'm gonna be the 
best warrior our people has ever 
had, and nobody's going to hurt mc . 
You can't even hun me, Bilioka. 1 
beat you every time," 

"Only because you cheat." 
"The only way to win is to play 
to win, which is why you never 
win," Tirin replied with a smug look 
on his face. 

He enjoyed teasing hL-. friend. 
especially since he knew Bilioka 
never took him seriously. 

They had the hidden under- 
standing that comes with being 
friends thai nothing either of them 
could do 10 each other would ever 
be oui of anger. 

Thai's why Tirin never worried 
about the future he knew he'd 
always have Bilioka by his side to 
help him deal wiih it 



As the two conversed further, 
they were soon interrupted by Uie 
sounds of loud drums and music 
pervading throughout the village. 

Dancers began to dance, singers 
began to sing, and the Greai Feast 
was beginning to get underway. 

Looking at each other, the two 
friends smiled as they both got up 
and got involved in the 
festivities. 

The Great Feast didn't look as it 
it were going to be so different after 
all.

Staff Writer 

Well, once again, I. tlie procrasiinalion mas- 
iL-r, have wailed utiiil ihe last minute to write ibi*;. 

Yet eailier in ihc wc(;k, 1 managed to compile 
several si/angc web sites thai can be enjoyed hy 
ttiDsc of high inlclligence and those who have 
lower IQ's than most jungle primates. 

How are these sites created^ If ! knew, I'd 
Stan creating my web site in the &amp;amc ra-sbion. 

As of now, however, it is unclear (o me just 
how they do it. I just enjoy them, How weird can 
the web gel.' I'll lei you be the judge of that. 

http://www.game.com/furby/lndex. 
html/ 

I won't spend much time on this one. 
Basically, it's about some play animal called a 
"Furby" tliat looks like a small furbaJl, walk-s. 
talk.s and opens and closes its eyelids, 

I put this site in here basically as a reference 
for a site discussed later in the arucle. 

http://www.totallyabsurd.com/ 

This site was a list of very strange inventions 
Ihal have been patented over the years. One 
invention was a hat one could put on that would 
coot the head via a built-in radiator. 

Two problems I could see were that it could 
give you looks that could turn you into an outcast 



and the fact that the radiator L-^n't too light. 

Anodier invention is Ihc poriablc atomic 
bomb sh'^ltcr that filters water and air. 

Ba.Mcally. you dig a hole in the ground and 
put a half-sphere over your head. J could do an 
entire separate anicle on the problems this thing 
would have. 

What do you do about fallout? 

Wouldn't nuclear wind or debris (such as fly- 
ing automobiles) blow the top clean off? 

What if the ground isn't firm? 

Would you have to buy six for a family of 



Here 1 found a din enthusiast's site, revealing his 
din treasures. 

Some of those included are din from the 
Green Bay Packer's Lambcau Held. 

I once saw a Packer's football game where 
they were handing out soil when they redid the 
surface. Those people were actually buying iL I 
diiiik that's a little overboard. 

I have nothing against Ihe Green Bay 
Packers, in fact most of the members of my fam- 
ily like the Green Bay Packers. I just think buy- 
ing soil is a little too much.

How much food can you actually stuff ii 
hole in die ground? I'm soiry, I'm just a cui 

guy: I like to know. 



http://www.sixsides.com/ 

I know we must have some "box" enthusiasts 
out there, so for you people 1 have found this site. 
It is a site where ynu can leam all about the won- 
derful device, the box, 

TTiere are even quotes referring to boxes. 
Best of all (or strangest of all), you can electron- 
ically customize a box to your standards, choos- 
ing from size, color, and type. 

Catch your breath, box fans, and run to the 
nearest PC to check this site out. 

http://www.planet.com/diitweb/dir 
t.html/ 

You din enUiusiasts are probably jealous that 
the box fans got dieir own site. Not to worry. 



a http://www.phobe.com/furby/ 

This site is titled "A Furby Autopsy." 
ApparenUy someone's Furby broke down, and he 
or she decided to do what any kind, caring person 
would do with a Furby iliat kicked the bucket — 
he or sbe decided to tear it apart. 

It's not just d]e concept of a "Furby Autopsy" 
Uiat makes it amusing to me but how well it was 
put together. 

The title image is of the Furby's hand with a 
tag like those put on dead bodies in a coroner's 
ofTice, I'm guessing this will soon become a Fox 
special. 

In the next issue or the one after, I'm hoping 
to get my section on IPFW students' personal 
web sites started. 

If you want to help me, send me your web 
site addresses. 

Odierwise. I might just search some last 
names and pick web sites from die student direc- 
tory. Don't make me mme for you!

College Football rejuvenated with unbelievable week of play 



S{ajff Writer 

I'm noi sure if this weekend's college 
fooiball action can equal last weekend's 
exciiemcnu but loolung at the scbcdulc, Ihe 
poicntial is there. 

Co-#l Kansas Stale Tinally goi by 
Nebraska (fot the fii^i time in thirty plus 
seasons) in a 40-30 ihrillcr. K-Siate 
Quarterback Michael Bishop overcame Tour 
turnovers by accounting for four touch- 
downs and over 400 yiirds of loial offense. 

This week the Wildcats iravet lo 
Mi.ssouri, who nearly upset S7 Texas A&amp;M 
last weekend. Should K-Siaic and A&amp;M 
win their remaining games, diey would 
meet in the Big 12 Cbampion^ihip game, 
December 5. 

Arkansas snatched dcfeai from ihc jaws 
of victory against the other fl Tennessee 
Volunteers, In the games nnaj minutes with 
Arkansas leading 24-20, the Razorbacks 
self-desimcted. 

First, the center shot the hall over the 
punter's head, toward the end zone. The 
punter wisely booted the tiall out 
of the end zone for a safety. 

Arkansas still had a two- point 
lead, and with the ball, all dicy 
needed to do was run the clock 
out 10 ensure a victory. 
Unfortunately for Arkansas, QB 
Oini Sioemcr stumbled and fum- 
bled (untouched). Mid Tennessee 
recovered. 

The Volunieers scored the 
game-winning touchdown with 
on ly ; 28 left to play. 
Redemption? If both of these 
teams win out, there will be a 
rematch in the SEC championship 
game in Atlanta's Georgia Dome 
on December 5. These two 
games featured three unbeaten 
teams and #11 Nebraska, but 
instead of seeing them locally, we 
were stuck with Notre 
Dame/Navy and Ohio Siate/lnwa. 

If you don't have a satellite 
dish, or DirecTV, or whatever is 
new, then gel yourself to a sports 
bar maybe Legends or Alumni to 
waich the games on tap for this 
weekend. 

Speaking of tap, Legends has 
a great variety of imports on tap, 
' including my favorites, Sierra 
I Nevada and New Castle, .... 



Tliis weekend's lineup features; USC at 
UCLA. Florida ai Rorida Stale. Kansas 
State at Missouri. Kentucky at TentKssee. 
Michigan at Ohio Stale. Penn State at 
Wisconsin, and Ihe game I will be attending. 
LSU at Noire Dame, 

Pan of me would rather be at the sports 
pub watching all of the other games. Have a 
great Saturday. 

Football, Football, Football, is there 
anything else to write about? Sure, ihere is 
college basketball, which is barely 
underway. 

Indiana won iLs Hrst three, but lacks the 
dominant inside game ncccs-sary lo win in 
the Big 10. Purdue and Michigan State will 
battle for die conference title. 
There's also the NHL. the worst of the 
major sporLs to waicb on television, but the 
besi to see in person. 

The NHL, like the NBA plays too many 
regular season games, and only gets inter- 
esting come playoff lime. 

TTiere's no NBA, and the only thing 1 
miss are the highlights on Sponscenter, The 
players and owners meet Friday for the first 
time in three weeks, 

I'm glad to see the sense of urgency to 



get a deal done. Still, I have no empathy for 
either side. 

This is the business side of spoas that 
the fans (including myself) cannot under- 
stand. Go ahead and cancel the entire sea- 
son. Both the players and the owners will 
loose billions collectively, and the fans will 
lose interest. Good idea, it worked brilliant- 
ly for baseball. 

Pro football is Ihe only other outlet for 
ii'e sports junkies. Last weekend saw a 
number of great games. 

The Falcons are in 1st place this late in 
the season for the first lime since 1980, after 
defeating the 49ers 31-19 in the Georgia 
Dome, 

After jumping out to 28-0 lead, the 
Cowboys needed a leniblc missed-call 
(pass interference) in the end zone no less, 
to escape Arizona with a 35-28 win over the 
Cardinals, 

The Tennessee Titans swept Ihe Sieelers 
and continue lo surprise, but the most sur- 
prising upset went to the lowly Colls, who 
are lookinE better as the season progresses. 

Peyton Manning threw a last minute 
touchdown pass to beat the then 1st place 
Jets 24-23. 



The Big T\ma cuuld not have been 
happy, getting shut out in the second half by 
a team widi only one win. Tlie Colts are 
usually good for one big win each year, and 
this was the one. 

The last three seasons the Colls have 
upset the defending Super Bowl Champs, 
though this year they don't face the Denver 
Broncos. 

TTk Broncos continue to roll, with a 
perfect 10-0 record. Their most difiicult 
game may come against the Miami 
Dolphins in the next to the last week on 
Monday Night Football. 

Games to watch this weekend include 
Green Bay at Minnesota Jacksonville at 
Pittsburgh, and Miami at New England on 
MNF, 



be nred. 

If these guys have a bad show is anyone 
calling for their jobs? It Ls ridiculous. Hie 
sad thing ls that they actually do have some 
degree of power 

By generating a public backlash against 
a coach, the owners (whether they admit it 
or not) do feel compelled to make a change. 

Media members watch and analyze 
games, bul are not in any position to call for 
a guy's head. 

TTierc an; so many iniangjbles that go 
into winning and losing that if you simply 
watch the games or Ttnal scores you have no 
idea where the problem lies. 

Media members, leive the personnel 
changes to those who are qualified.

Womens Volleyball team upset in Semi-finals 



Spans Fdiwr 

Ii was a greai weekend of vol- 
leyball in ihc Greai Lakes Volleyball 
Conrercnce [oumameni. 

Unronunaiely. Tor the Etons iliis 
[oumameni had up.sci ciiy wrilicn all 
over ii. 

In ihe rirst match a classy 
Beltarminc squad defeaied a hyped 
SIU-Edwardsville 3-2 

Tben an unheralded Lewis team 
was up 2-1 befofe letting Quiney 
back in the game and eventually 
winning the malcb. 

However, in the thiid match. 
nrsi .seed Nnnhcm Kentucky had no 
problem against St. Joseph's 
College. 

This led to a gym filled with 
Blue .ind While fans waiting lo see 
the Dons, 

What Uiey saw was atypical: a 
Dons team that struggled early on 
and was out of sync the whole 
match. The Dons did battle back and 
defeat ITMSL in four games. 

In the middle ot the Hrsl game 
Middle hitler Rachel Brown went 
down and tore her Anterior Cniciale 
Ligament and will have to undergo 
surgery over semester break. 

This loss is crucial, bui hopeful- 
ly Freshman Jenny Miller can step 
up. 

Milter is one of the Icam's best 
blockers but as a freshimui, has litile 
NCAA experience. 

Her play was put lo the test 
against a feisty Quiney team. 

The Northern Kenlucky- 
Bcllcrminc semirmal game started 
out with Bellerminc playing tough 
and winning the first game but NKU 
proved too tough and defeated them 
in four games. 

The IPFW-Quincy game started 
out with great intensity. 

The Dons took the first game 
16-14, then lost the second 14-16. 
Quiney took the third game 15-12, 
but was smoked by IPFW 2-15 in 
the fourth. 

With momentum on the Dons 
side, game five looked to be swing- 
ing the Dons' way. 

In rally play the game changed

soon quieted the crowd aitd ended 
up winning the game and the match 
17-15. 

That featured NKU-Quincy in 
the final game, NKU defeated 
Quiney with little difficulty in three 
games. 

Despite the Dons' disappoint- 
ment in the conference tournament 
they will be given a second chance 
(his time in the NCAA tournament 



against conference foe Northern 
Kentucky, 

The teams met earlier and NKI_I 
defeated the Dons in four games. 

This time the Dons are going to 
be t{x&gt;king for revenge. 

It is their fourth appearance in 
the NCAA tournament and they are 
hoping it will be belter than their 
last in 1996 when they lost to 
Nonhem Michigan in three straight 



Heffron named Coach of the Year
