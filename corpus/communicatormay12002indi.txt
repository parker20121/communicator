New sculpture, building to transform Purdue campus 



WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind, — 
{PU News SeAice) Purdue 
University, long known for its 
international reputation as a 
leader in cngincenng, the sci- 
ences and agriculture, is now 
flexing its artistic muscles. 

The transformation is under 
way at the south end of campus 
where a 40-fool bronze sculp- 
ture, designed by a renowned 
Spanish artist was installed this 
week ncxi lo Ihe girders and 
bearru forming the skeleton for 
Purdue's new S38 million visual 
and performing arts building. 

Created by Faustino 
Aizkorbe (pronounced eye- 
SKOR-bay). the sculpture 
~Trai\s format ion" was unveiled 
Saturday in Ihe heart of the 
Agricultural Mall, al the inter- 
section of Marsteller and Wood 
streets. The ceremony featured 
coirunents by Purdue President 
Martin C, Jischke. Aizkorbe and 
Donald Roach, campaign co- 
chairman of the Class of 1952, 
who made the gilt Dossible. The 
dedication is part of the ongoing 
Discover Purdue celebrations, a 
yearlong campaign to highlight 
Ihe university's accomplish- 
ments and aspirations. 

The Class of '52 raised 
S860.000 in private contributioru 
lor the sculpture and lo provide 
Academic Success Awards lor 
students. These awards provide 
students with ioui-year scholar- 
ships based on their high school 
academic records, in tunv they 
must maintain a 35 grade point 
average while al Purdue, 

"Transformation' beautiHes 
Ihc campus — allowmg the arts 
to complement and eiihance our 
academic life," Jischke said. "At 
the same time, many students 
will benefit from neiv scholar- 
stup opportunities that have been 
created by a group of individuals 
who have demorulrated their 



commitment to their alma mater," 

Roach said his classmates — 
many of them engineering and 
science graduates — recognized 
that a great university must 
embrace the arts, 

"We are convinced that our 
gift will have a significant 
impact on the aesthetic quality 
of campus and will contribute to 
an environment that will help 
Purdue attract and retain hign 
quality students, faculty and 
staff." he said. 

Transformation" is mounted 
underground on a footing that is 
16 by 16 feet (vide, so the sculp- 
ture appears to emerge directly 
from the earth, 

"The locahon of the sculpture 
brings more aesthetic promi- 
r;ence to the south end of cam- 

tius. hopefully serving as a cata- 
yst for future changes to 
Agriculture Mall, making it 
more pedestrian friendly." said 
Jotm Collier, university architect, 
"We've certainly erijoyed work- 
ing with Faustino. His warm and 
engaging style makes our lan- 
guage barrier easier to manage," 

Aizkortw is well known for 
his large-scale abstract sculp- 
tures made from marble, steel, 
bronze, stone and wood. His 
polished surfaces, curved lines 
and circles combine to create 
self-standing forms, resembling 
and suggestuig the cormection to 
the pieces of a machine. Made of 
cast bronze, "Transformation" 
marks his first commissioned 
work m the United Slates. 

The artist visited Purdue 
twice to meet with students, fac- 
ulh' and Class of '52 leaders 
Iwiore beginning the sculpture, 
and hestayed on campus to help 
oversee the mstalbtion. 

The massive installabon effort 
required significant landscape 
modilicalions, ttxe installahon of 
a sidewalk and a new retaining 



wall. Collier said, 

"Trans forma hon," positioned 
at the west end of the future 
visual and performing arts 
building, was strategically locat- 
ed to provide a new gathering 
spot where people can sit, relax 
and share time together. Collier 
said. The bcautificalion is pari of 
an ongoing architectural masler 
plan designed to form a "spine" 
that creates visual pathways and 
dear sight lines from the 
Agriculhiral Mall to the Class of '39 
water sculpture and the bell tower. 

Viewed from above. 
"Transformalion" appears as if it 
were unfurling to create a sym- 
metrical pattern, symbolizing 
what Aizkorbe refers lo as 
Purdue's continued evolution 
and changing nature, supported 
by the strength of its heritage. 

Aizkort&gt;e said his inspiration

Purdue remmded him of Ihe 
Romanesque pillars and capitals 
required to support some of the 
world's great buildings. He 
believes the sculpture represents 
Purdue's engineering heritage

expanding scope. 

Across the road, work contin- 
ues on the construction of the

advising 

By Todd Hamm, News Editor 

After hearing "horror sto- 
ries" and "lots of complaints" 
from students about their facul- 
ty advisors, Student Body 
President Justin Busch plans to 
spend the summer working 
with the Student Senate to 
rework and improve advising 
on campus, 

"This is a major problem. 
This is the biggest gripe 1 hear 
from students." Busch said, 
"bul I think we can find a solu- 
tion lo this problem," 

Working with the Student 
Senate, Busch plaru to pass a 
resolution that will create a 
committee to look inio advising 
on campus. The corrunillee will 
then draw una report on advis- 
ing and offer solulioiu and 
improvements, Busch said. 

Busch said professors need 
more training in advising stu- 
dents. He said he believed spe- 
cific schools within the univer- 
sity need lo place more empha- 
sis on advising. Another solu- 
tion he offered entailed hiring 
Erofe&amp;sionab whose jobs would

ing students. 

"My hope is that the Senate 
and myself can put together a 
resolution lo solve this prott- 
lem," Busch said, 

"I think our retention rate 
would improve with better 
advising." he added, 

Busch dc&gt;es not Itiink that 
advising on campus is. on Ihe 
whole, a disaster, 

Ttiere are some great advisors 
on campus, but some look at it as 
a chore and a nuisance," he said, 

William Bruening, assistant 
dean of the School of Arts and 
Sciences, agreed with some of 
Busch's sentiments. 

Some faculty advisors, he 
said, look at the job of advising 
with a "sometimes adversarial 

"On the whole, advising is

In the April 17th issue of Thi- 
Coniinuiiicalor, a staff editorial cntillcd 
"Human Cloning Issues: A catastroohe 
wailing lo happen." was printed in 
which the author outlined in a very 
simplistic (and often incorrect) manner 
the evils of human cloning as he or she 
understands it. 

We. as sludenls in the 500-lcvel 
Biolechnology course at IPFW. biology 
majors and future scientists, wish to 
take this opportunity to coirecl many 
of Ihe fallacies and misrepresentations 
of facts aboul cloning contained in this 
editorial. It is clear tn reading this edi- 
torial Ihal the author has little or no 
knowledge about the cloning process, 
I'm afraid that a superficial search of 
the literature carmot possibly provide 
one with all of Ihe background knowl- 
edge needed to be able to make a 
Ihoughtful logical argument either for 
or against human cloninc. The amount 
of misinformation regarding cloning is 
staggering, and we suspect Ihat Ihe 
author has fallen victim to the purvey- 

We have serious issues wilh the 
presentation of certain "facts" regard- 
mg cloning. The author claims ll\at in 
W7, Dolly was created after 300 failed 



Parthenogenesis creates an 
"embryo" via self-fertilization, i,c,, the 
egg is induced to fertilize ilsel/. At four 
orlive days of development, stem cells 
can be harvested from Ihe iruier cell 
mass and potentially t&gt;e used to form 
new tissues or organs. SCNT works in 
a similar maimer, except Ihe nucleus is 
removed from an unfertilized egg and 
replaced with Ihe nucleus from a non- 
sex cell.

'The author proudly points out 
Ihat the creation of one human life 
could result in the deaths of 300 others. 
This point of view is possibly Ihe 
creates I misconception regarding 
human cloning: that somehow life 
must be destroyed to "create life." In 
the editorial, the author does nut make 
the distinction between therapeutic 
cloning and reproductive cloning.

- - -^w should nol be undertaken at 



this 



ne), the desired end product is an

if there is a minuscule chance (if any) 
that these entities will be capable of 
developing inio fetuses? I don't realis- 
tically thinli Ihat the author would con- 
sider a parthenogenelic egg to be 
equivalent to a human, but where do 
we draw the line? 

A few other inaccuracies con- 
tained in Ihe editorial need to be 
addressed. The author stales that 
cloning is a risky process because of 
recent unexplained deaths in cloned 
animals. He or she refers lo a sludy 
carried out in Japan in which only two 
out of 12 cloned mice lived more than 
BOO days, or approximately 26 to 27 
months. This would be very com- 
pelling evidence were il not for Ihe fad 
that Ihe average lifespan of a healthy 
mouse is appiosimately 18-36 months. 
We shudder to think of the public out- 
rage thai would ensue if it were 
aruiounced that only i/6 of all human 
clones would live beyond the age of 60. 

Another issue that makes the bJI 
before the Senate insufficient is the lack 
of an accurate definition of a "done," 
The (vay the bill before Ihe Senate is 
worded, there will be a ban on all 
human cloning, but we found it interest- 
ing that Ihe author would so adamantly 
supporl the ban wilhout accurately 
denning what constitutes a clone. 

In simplest terms. . '

lutlawing the 



found on Ihe Internet and in the media 
regarding human cloning The author 
reveals Ihat he or she has fallen victim 
to Ihis misinformation by referring lo 
Clonaid, Inc. as a pnvalety funded 
company pursuing the cloning of a 
human being, II the author would 
have bothered lo perform a simple 
background cheek on Clonaid, Inc,, he 
or she would have found that Ihis 
company was founded by a cull called 
the Ra^hans, who believe that humans 
were created by alien scientists from 
their own cloned DNA (vhen their 
spaceships landed on Earth long ago. 

Their leader, in fact, actually testi- 
fied before Congress dressed in a 
spacesuit and claimed that they will 
have a human clone by the end of the 
year. Given what is known about the 
funding of tliis group and theli scien- 
tific knowledge, these claims are 
almost certainly false. Their leader in 
fact wrote to followers that cult mem- 
bership has greatly increased since his 
aiuiouncemenl, and that "We got 
510.000 worth of advertising for free " 

Using this group as an example of 
why cloning should oe outlawed wilh- 
out giving the appropriate background 
information to readers is at best irre- 
sponsible journalism, and at worst bla- 
tant, politically motivated deception. 
Besides, if Ihe bill outlawing clorung 
passes, it is highly doubtful that 
Clonaid, Inc. will oe affected since Ihe 
Raelians are headquartered in Canada. 

We appreciate being given the 
opportimity lo answer Ihe edilonal 
published on April 17. We feel as 
though the author oversimphfied the 
issue by leavmg out fads without 
which it would be impossible to make 
an informed decision on human 
cloning. The amount of misleading 
information on the Internet and m the 
media regarding human cloning is

points oul. can lead lo many unforeseen 
difficulties and psychological trauma. 

However, in therapeutic cloning, 
the end products are stem cells that can 

entire organs to replace defective tis- 
sues and orgaiB in people with disease. 
They are t^vo very dishnct areas 
of research that Ihe author (not lo men- 
tion Ihe bill before the Senate) has 
erroneously joined together in an 
allempt to bring about a comprehen- 
sive ban on all cloning research. It may 
surprise the author to learn Ihat the 
stem cells used to create these new lis- 

from unfertilized eges. The unnamed 
author must not nave researched 
parthenogenesis or somatic cell 
nuclear transler (SCNT) because these 
terms were nowhere to be found in the 
editorial. Both of these techniques are 
used lo create embryos from eggs that 
have not been fetliUzed by sperm for 
Ihe sole purpose of harvestmg their 
stem cells.

The 



DNA located in the nucleus, bul there 
IS a small amount of DNA contained in 
the mitochondria of most non-sex cells. 

One of the most commonly used 
cloning technologies (the SCNT tech- 
nique used lo create Dolly) consists of 
transplanting Ihe nucleus of a non-sex 
cell inIo an egg whose nucleus has 
been removed. The intent is to create 
an individual genetically similar to the 
individual from whom the non-sex cell 
was taken. Hcnvever. the enucleated 
egg still retains its original mitochon- 
dria, and therefore some of the DNA 
contamed in the clone will "belong" to 
the donor of the egg. This is nol an 
exact genetic copy of an mdividual, 
and as such cannot t&gt;e considered a 
"done." How wiU the bill before Ihe 
Senate address this concern? If this bill 
is made law without taking litis con- 
sideration into account, it could open 
up a gigantic loophole that would ren-

As linal'. iveek approaches, we at TTie Communicator would like lo 
lake this lime to remind students that, althou^ this time of Ihe sernes- 
ler can be very stressful, calling in a Iromb threat is a very serious 

According lo IPf^ Police and Safety, false reporting ol a bomb 
threat is a Class D felony, punishable by a sentence of IB months to two 
years in prison. Persons convicted of Ihis felony also receive a fine of up 
to 510,000 and must reimburse the university for time lost due lo the call. 
Police and Safety reported that one student convicted of phoning in a 
false bomb threat was required lo pay an addilional S7,000 fee for the 
university's lost time. 

The avenues and tools used for investigating false reports have 
improved greatly in Ihe past few years, according lo IPFW Police and 
Safety', and they are able lo get more evidence than ever before. Police 
and Safety also reported that the last four persons who called in false 
bomb threats have been apprehended. 

As students, we at Tlie Communicator urge others to refrain from 
this practice. Time and money are lost when people come lo campus Ic 
lake their finals, only lo be turned away because of someone's prarvk.

Banshees scream in Chicago 

British pop goddess Siouxsie shines at Chicago's famous Vic Theatre after long hiatus 




By Jonah Ctl-

ined audiences for more than 25 years, and is not by any 
lalion disappointing fans now with her present tour. 



in 1977, stie made music hisiory ivhen she 
tupponcd lo be on It\e ill-faled "Btll Gnindy 
Show- Willi The Sen Pistols. Thai was the same 
show in which The Sex PisloLs were heard using 
several profanities that resulted m Grundy losing 
his show. A vear later, she took the UK charts by 
slorm with me song "^ong Kong Garden." 

Throughout the 19805 she created hit after 
hit with songs Uke "Christine" and "Red Light," 
Rol&gt;ert Srruth of The Cure was so enlranced by 
her, he temporarily broke up his own band in 
order to late the plare as hef guitarist. This 
woman, who m her 25 years recording has not 
made a very marketable splash in the United 
States, yet is considered to be one of the most 
influential female artists of all lime, is none other 
than Siouisie. 

Forming lines hours before the start of the 
show, the fa[\s came lo see one thing — Siouisie 
and The Banshees in concert, Siouxsie sold out 
two mammoth shows at the Vic Theatre in 
Chicago, drawing in thousands of black clad 
youths from all over. What made this show so 
important was the fact thai Siouxsie has not hit 
the road with the Banshees in close to 10 years. 

The show began with girl rock band X-Cirl, 
who quickly won the admiration and praise of a 
few members of the audience, but in the end 
seemed lo disappoint the vast majority of the 
fans. While X-Cirl demonstrated a great deal of 
enthusiasm and energy, their shoiv seemed pale 
m comparison to what was in store when Siouxsie 
and The Banshees took the stage. 

X-Cirl, entering the stage in foam outfits, 
combined improvisalion ballet and heavy-hitting 
rock. Hearing Ihe jeers of the crowd, they wcnl 
into their hardest son^, still wearing smiles. 
Eventually the audience warmed up to this band, 
after the pleads to leave the stage were overpow- 
ered by X-Girl's hard rhythm section. A fan was 
even heard losay tlul X'Cirl's music made her sick. 

After X&lt;;irl left the stage, the fans were left 
to lalk among Ihetnselves, some of whom had 
never seen Siouxsie and some of whom have fol- 
lowed Siouvsic through ever)' leg of her lour. The 



dimmed and s- .... 

over Ihe audience. The spotlights hit Ihe sla^ 
and Ihe Banshees entered, loUowod by a very chic 
and graceful Siouisie. 

Opening with songs from her earlier days, 
Siouxsie wooed the audience by her movements, 
her facial expressions and her voice. 

The Banshees sounded tlghler than ever 
before, playing each song as energized as though 
it was conung from The Banshee's fiisl albums. 

Technical difhcultics at the Vic, a subject 
many artists complain about, &gt;vcre at a minimum 
for Siouxsie. During only one song did Siouxsie's 
vocals fade out from Ihe rest of The Banshees' 
music. However, a sound engineer quickly fixed 
the situation and saved the song. 

The fans of this concert were as much a part of 
the concert as Ihe sultry star The fans sang Iheir 
hearts out ^vilh every song and moved on Ihe floor 
almost as much as Siouxsie moved on stage. Fans 
e^en complained of losing Iheir voices alter scream- 
ing so loud during the applause after each song. 

Explaining lo Ihe audience thai this slop in 
Chicago was the only stop for the Banshees in Ihe 
midwest, Siouxsie (vas blown aisray by a barrage 
of pleas from Ihe audience lo remain in Chicago, 
If there is one place al one lime where an artist 
could feel truly apprecialed, it would have been 
al Chicago on that Monday night. 

After confirming the audience's fears that 
Ihe concert would come lo an end and the 
Bar\shec5 needed lo get ready for Ihe trip to Ihe 
West Coast. Siouxsie sang her last song "Blue lay 
Vhy" the Beatles' cover. Covering The Beatles is not 
new for Siou.xsie who has recorded very pulsatine 
versions of "Heller Skelter" arui "Clear Pnidcnce. 
bolh of which were from Ihe Beatles' "VVhite Album." 

This lour marks the first lour for The 
Banshees after disbanding in 1993. when Siouxsie 
and husband and drummer Budgie decided to 
devote Iheir musical efforts in Iheir side project, 
The Creahjres, 

Siouxsie and The Banshees have played 
shows all along the East Coast, stopping in 
Chicago for two day:;, and are novv touting along 
the Wesi Coast.

Hovak has been out since April 5 (wilh a

Left Vs. Right 



Left, right discuss pedophilia, priesthood. Catholic Church 



1 imagine Ihat Ihcrc are few v/ho have not 
heard about Ihe recent set scandal within the 
Catholic Church. I hear about it on television. I 
hear about it on the radio. 1 was even involved 
in a hcjtcd and lengthy debate in one of my 
classes here at school. I'm wondering why Ihis Is 
classified as a ■'recent" scandal. Why has it taken 
so long for Ihe church, its parishioners and socie- 
ty at large lo bring lon^tanding issues of sexual 
abu&amp;e into the public eye? 

I have heard people talking about piolecl- 
ing the church. 1 have heard people talk about 
restoring trust. What about all ol the good 
priests who are being hurt by the scandal? What 
about Ihe Mother Church? It is all loo common 
lor the mother to prolcci Ihe abuser, rather than 
protect Ihe child. I believe that is what Ihe 
Molhct Church has been doing (or generations. 
The church has become a safe haven for 






From 

the 

Left 



No. I don't 
believe that all 
priests arc devianlsl 
I do believe Ihal 
through systematic 
efforts lo suppress 
the truth, the Mother 
Chun:h has alloived 
her children tobc- 
hurt m Ihe most hor- 
rific way possible. 
Tlic teal Question we 
should all be asking 
is what can we do for 
the victims. 



sciiual abu!«. Ihe children are damaged nol only 
by the offender and by the rape or molestation, 
they are damaged by their own silence and by 
the fad Ihal wRen they do dare lo speak, the 
repercussions often tcsull in more cfamage to Ihe 
child. The adults may nol believe them. The 
abuser alien goes unpunished. 

The mother, or in Ihis case the church, does 
nothing lo prolecl Ihe children from future inci- 
dences of aliiise. I read the statement issued by 
the United Slates cardirwis. They slate thai they 
"regret that Episcopal oversight has not been 
able lo preserve the church from Ihis scandal." 
They go on lo say that. "The entire church. Ihe 
bride of Christ, is afflicted by this wound— the 
vicbms and their families hrst of all, but also 
Ihose who have dedicated their lives to the 
priestly service of the Gospel of God." The first 
thing that the statement adoiesscs is the scandal 
and the damage lo Ihe church, while only later docs 
it acknowledge the victims. 

The Catholic Church has a history of sup- 
pressing sciuality. Sex is sin, unless il is between 



a married couple and m the missionary Dosition. 
Religion has taught us to keep quiet alio not lo 
have sex. If we do have sei. we shouldn't enjoy 
it. and we certainly shouldn't talk about sex. 
even if we are molested or raped. Shaine perpet- 

The priests must lake vows of celibacy. 
Don't gel me wrong, I don't believe that celibacy 
causes pedophilia, but il certainly limits the 
number and type of people who choose lo be 
priests. As long as we seek to keep senuahty in 
the closet, as long as we are afraid to speak out. 

will continue lo be plagued by abuse 
ps. 

Even now, the church refuses to adopt a 
zero tolerance policy toward pedophiles They 
agreed to make il "easier" to defrock priests who 
arc guilly of sexual abuse of children, but, and 
there il is. Ihe big "Tjut." they only want lo turn 
the "notorious" abusers over to authorities. 

They are willing to lum over the serial 
offenders, but whal about Ihe ones who only get 
caught once? Well then it is up to the bishop to 
decide if they are really a threat to children. Isn't 
once enough? Should wc ask the one child? 
What about Ihe priests who offended years ago, 
possibly repeatedly, but have nol re-offended for 
years? The filial statement issued by Ihc Vatican 
failed lo include a blanket order for dusmissal. 
and il failed lo make specific proposals regardmg 
reporting sexual abuse crimes lo the authorities. 

I wonder, whal does this say about us as a 
society? I think Ihal the outcome can speak vol- 
umes. If wc as a society demand Ihal the silence 
be broken, if we come logelher lo speak on 
behalf of our children, we can make some seri- 
ous strides forward. Just Ihe fact thai this has 
made the news is positive. 

Now what? Do wc let il move back into Ihe 
closet? I know a man who was molested by a 
priesi; he ivent on lo become an offender. Did 
Ihe pnesl make him an offender? 1 don't believe 
thai we can place all Ihe blame on the priest; as 
adults, we all make choices and are responsible 
for our own actions. I do believe that the priest 
played his part in perpetuating a cycle of sick- 
ness and abuse. 1 believe that when we decide lo 
make those who protect the abusers accountable, 
the instances of abuse will decline. It is not only 
the priests who abused the children, but also 
their superiors — by refusing lo act lo prolecl the 
children, they allowed Ihe abuse lo continue. 

Bad things happen when good people 
refuse to act. Ibelieve that it is time for action. I 
believe that it is time that we demand change 
and break the cycle. I believe that it is lime Ihal 
we embrace the individual, rather than protect 
the institution. Bui that's fusl my opinion. 



We i-e all heard the slones about Caihotjc pnests arid pedophilia, and most rwenl- 
ly, Ihe Pope's meeting ivith all 13 American Cattiolic Canlinals to discuss the piobloiL 

As tired as I am sure ynu are about hearing about Ihe disgushng habits of a few 
sick individuals, I thought I owed j-ou, my faithful followers and readers, my two cents 
on the issue. 

At first look and after ^arvnng bnclly at the rvws media coverage of Ihe issue, 
one might draw ttw conclusion that aU Cathobcpnests are pedophiles- Bui thai IS nol 
the case. Rather, only a smaU pit^rticm of the thousands of Catholic priests in America 
have a problem. 

Sillily less noticeable is the fad Ihal these pedophiks aren't vour topical 
pedorfuie. thoe pedophiks generally molesl childien of the same sex, 

llie problem bes ncl m the CaihoW Oiuidi's denund for ccUbac)- trom lis pnests,

quately follow and logcomplaints against its priests.

with another nun is forbidden 
Ihe very scriptures these men call 
holy; "Do you nol know that the 
wicked wilt nol inherit tfie king- 
dom of God? Do nol be deceived; 
Neither the sexually immoral nor 
idolaters nor adullerere nor male 
proehtulcs nor homosexual offend- 
cis . . will inhent the kingdom of 
God." 1 Connthians 6.-9-10 (NIV) 

How, then, do these men. 
who claim lo be believers and fol- 
lowers of Jesus Christ and Ihe very Holy Bible. God- inspired, practice such habits, 
e.fpressly forbidden by Ihe Holy ftriptures and the official teachings of Ihe Catholic 
Church? 

The answer, lo me, is simple. These men have, despite Ihe waminjp of Paul in 1 
Corinthians, been deceived. These pncsis have al some lime convinced themselves that 
their desires lo nol oiJy violate the Holy Bible, Ihe official leadiing of the Catholic 
Church and their governing bws, but lo violate the very innocence of a small boy. who 
looks up lo and admiies Ihls phesl. 

The boy, in all his innocence, believes this pnesl to be a man oICakI, someone 
who nol onl^ knows righl from wrong, but who practices right ivhile shunning ivnaig. 
The boy desires nothing more than lo spend lime wilh this man of God, gleaning what 
he can about Cod from Ihe life of this pnesl. 

The boy, in all his innocence, doesn't understand Ihal a pnesl isn't supposed lobe 
fondling his pnvate parts. "Is this part of normal life, lo be male, touching another 
boy's privates? ' 

"These few priests have robbed these boys of Iheir innocenct', stealing from them 
what was nol theirs for the taking, while wreaking havoc upon the Catholic Church. 

These fe^v men, when ihcy have chosen ID live Ihcii life according lo their own 
dtsires instead of following Ihe set standard lor right and wrcng scl forth in the Holy 
Bible, have set a huge problem now facing the CaSolic Church. 

Was the bnef enjoyment ol pedophiEac homosexual encounters (vilh innocent 
boys worth il in Ihe long run for If^se men? 

My heart and prayers go out to Ihe boys whose life is elerruUy scarred by the 
actions of a few selnsh and weak men. 

These few moi aren't an accurate represoitation of the Catholic Church, or any 
other Christiiin church, for that mailer These feiv men, who have mistakenly been 
given the title of priesi. are a disgrace to the faith, the Church and Christiaiiily 

All is nol lost. ho(ve\er. there are slil! many, many priests and pastors who ate 
nornul. who actually follow the Holy Bible Ihej' claim lo believe in. Find a church 
ivhere Ihe priesi or pastor pieadies the Holy Bible as Ihc holy Wird ol God — and does 
a ptetty dam good |ob of following il. loo.
