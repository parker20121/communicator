just because the main parking

Forum on energy policy 
Dec. 7 



One of the many unfortunate side 
effects of the disputed presidential 
election is how the fracas in Florida 
icfocuscd political coverage on per- 
sonalities, instead of on questions of 
public policy. The race for president is 
like any other: ^e important question 
is not who will lake office, but what 
the person will do to affect people, 
families and communities. If we can 
take a well-deserved break from the 
nation's longest election night, we will 
realize there is a critical need lo focus 
al least some of our attention on ques- 
tions of energy policy 

After a rash of oil company 
mergers, drivers in the U.S. and else- 
where paid record high prices for 
gasoline this summer Families using 
natural gas face increases of AO to 60 
percent in healing bills this winter. 
Inlcmalional talks to address global 
climate change collapsed this month in 
the Hague, with many nations blaming 
U.S. delegation for failing to support 
steps to reduce the world's dependence 
on fossil fuels. 

Across the U.S.. electric utilities 
are leading a state-by.slate push lo 
"de-regulate" electric markets, thereby 
dismantling almost a century's worth 
of proleclions for residential ratepay- 
ers, De- regulation's first and most 
spectacular failure was in California, 
where San Diego ratepayers saw elec- 
tric rales increase 300 percent after de- 
regulation was implemented. 

Electric de-regulation is about 






: pow&lt; 



however. De-regulation means hand 
ing enormous electric, economic and 
polilical power to a few multinational 
energy companies. Families in Aboile 
Township have already seen what hap. 
pens when a mcdium-siied water util- 
ily runs amok. Imagine the damage a 
de- regulated electric behemoth with 

After repeated failures to find 
suppon for proposals to de-regulate 
Indiana's electric market, one such 
behtmoth. American Electric Power, 
announced it will split itself inlo two 
companies. One company will focus 
on gpjierat ing power for lucrative. 



high-iTjIume 'wholesale' 
the other will play the role of a iradi- 
lional monthly utility serving fami- 
lies and other "letair cuitomcis. 

This is an apparent end tun 
around slate regulation vvhich raises 
serious qucslioni for Indiana cus- 
tomers: Will the "wholesale" company 
with most of the generating capacity 
be able to cut sweetheart deals with 
the 'retail" utility at the cipense of 
Indiana families? Who will wind up 
paying millions of dollars lo de-com- 
mission AEFs Cook nuclear power 
plant and store its tonic nuclear wosle? 

Elsewhere in Indiana. NIPSCO's 
electric customers are still paying 
Indiana's highest electric rales lo a 
utility which on several occasion! 
failed to pn&gt;vide reliable service to iu 
customers. The union representing 
NIPSCO employees says that utility 
has cut staffing and maintenance costs 
10 finance acquisitions such as the %6 
billion purchase of Columbia Gas. 

Rural residents across Indiana 
face the prospect of }0 or more natural 
gas-fired "peaket' plants being 
brought inlo theii communities. This 
building boom can affect even those 
living nowhere near a proposed plant. 
Gas turbines bum millions of Btu's of 
natural gas, which will only exacer- 
bate already high natural gas prices. 

Our political system allows citi- 
zens to educate themselves and organ'

Hardy finds Junuh drinking and playing cards
