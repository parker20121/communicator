As the final days of 
National Blood Donor 
Month come to an end, 
the oppominit&gt;' and 
chance to make a differ- 
ence towards someone's 
life continues. 

Though the commit- 
ment of dedicating an 



hour or more out of your 
day towards drawing 
bl ood may seem like a 
burden, establishments 
such as the American 
Red Cross (ARC) and Bio- 
Life, are in constant ef- 
foris towards making the 
process of donating more 
efficient and pleasant. 

While the. ARC em- 
phasizes Shfe, need, for 
blood, thejjdo not'iro^ 



vide monetary compen- 
sation for donating. On 
the other hand, the ARC 
does have more donating 
options. 

Platelet Pheresls 
Besides whole blood, 
which is the more popu- 
lar option of blood dona- 
tion, there is a process of 
drawing blood known as 
Platelet Pheresis, which 
separates blood into its 



components, drawing 
platelets, possibly plas- 
ma, then returning re- 
maining blood. Though 
the procedure is longer 
than donating whole 
blood (about two and a 
half hours), it is easier 
on the body and you can 
actually finish watching 
an entire movie from 
their library.

Perfect ion. It is a 
word to often thrust 
upon those who do not 
actually deserve such a 
severe honor. 

But it is not on the 
field of athletic battle. 
Because in sports per- 
fection always has to 
end with 

And it is that word 
"perfection" and that 
lingering zero that 
brings fourth SuperBowl 



XLII and the New Eng- 
land Patriots' pursuit of 
further perfection. 

A win makes them 
just the second NFL 
tt*am to go perfect and 
justthe fifth in the major 
four sports (including 
the Cleveland Browns in 
the pte-NFL league the 
AAFC). 

Consequently, they 
were also the first to ac- 
complish this under the 
NFL's salary cap policy, 
which was established 
in 1994 to encourage 
competitive equality 
among teams. 



Their perfect season 
started in the fall and 
continued, week after 
week. NFL record after 
NFL record, highlighted 
by an AFC title game 
win over the San Diego 
Chargers on January 21, 
A win that sends them 
to Arizona this Sun- 
day to compete for that 
aforementioned fourth 
SuperBowl crown. 

The perfect season 
has also occurred once 
in Canadian football, 
five times in NCAA 
men's basketball, and 
a number of times in 



NCAA football and 

leagues : 
the world. The last un- 
defeated season came in 
1976 when the Indiana 
Hoosiers won a national 
men's basketball title. 

But as their perfect 
19-0 season is on the 
line against the New 
York Giants this Sunday 
New England has some- 
thing much bigger than 
perfection on the line. 

They, in fact, have 
the chance to go down 
as the best franchise in

Feeling blue? 

Those 'winter blahs' may be 
Seasonal Affective Disorder 



By MELISSA AKA50N 
AkasmaOl @ipfw.edu 



Do you feel lethargic, 
moody, resdess, and un- 
able to concentrate? If so, 

then you may be experi- 
encing Seasonal Affec- 
tive Disorder (SAD). 

Seasonal Affective 
Disorder is a form of 
depression that occurs 
most commonly during 
the winter months and is 
caused by the shortened 
days and longer nights. 

The disorder is still 
being researched and has 
not been recognized by 
the Diagnostic and Sta- 
dstical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM4} as a 
unique mood disorder It 
is however, according to 
the American Academy 
of Family Physicians, a 
specifier of major de- 
pression. 

The disorder is com- 
monly referred to as the 



'winter blues' and is spec- 
ulated by psychiatrists 
to be caused by the sea- 
sonal change of chemical 
levels in the body. 

Melatonin, accord- 
ing to http://s!eepcom- 
pliance.com, a natural 
hormone that is secreted 
by the pineal gland in 
the brain in response to 
darkness associated with 
sleep. 

While our bodies ad- 
just to the lighting of 
seasonal change, a neu- 
rotransmitter known as 
serotonin, which regu- 
lates many functions in- 
cluding mood, appetite. 
and sensory perception, 
is being fluctuated and 
unbalanced. 

There are plenty of 
options to be consid- 
ered when treating SAD 
including a regimen 
known as light therapy 
This treatment uses a 
specially designed light 
box in which a patient 



would sit away from it to 
increase serotonin levels. 
One unorthodox method 
to a light box session is a 
tanning bed. 

Though diese meth- 
ods are not FDA ap- 
proved, according to an 
article in Science News 
Online, daily exposure to 
bright light is about as ef- 
fective as antidepressant 
drugs. 

For those hesitant to 
spend money on tan- 
ning minutes an alterna- 
tive would be the more 
popular medication 

route. FDA approved 
pharmaceuticals such 
as Wellbutrin XL, Zoloft, 
Paxil, and Prozac are all 
serotonin inducers that 
influence balance in the 
body. 

So if you're feeling 
down right now. lake a 
flashlight to the face, and 
go outside aiid play. It's a 
temporary solution, but 
you might get a laugh.

Surviving the slump 

Make a budget, stick to it and drop the excuses 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

riichjl01@ipfw.edu 



So the buzz around 
ihe keg is that tlie U.S. 
economy is heading to- 
ward a recession. 

But really, does 
it matter since 
we are all broke 
college students 
anyway? Well, 
the obvious an- 
swer is. ..yes. Of _ 



"Live within your means 

by refusing to charge 

anything but emergencies 

on credit cards." 



By THOMAS KING 

U-WIRE 



A tax rebate of $300 
to fight Ihe recession? 
Realty? An unimpressed 
"thanks" is the best the 
government will get from 
me. In the hands of col- 
lege students, S300 will 
last all of two weeks. In- 
stead of cutting checks, 
they should pay attention 
to the primary concerns 
of most consumers: gas 
and food. 

But wait. If you did 
not make more than 
$3,000 dollars during the 
2007 tax year, then you 
do not get any money. 
Upset now? Good, let's 
continue. 

Congress will be vot- 
ing in the next week on 
whether to pass a $150 
billion economic stimu- 
lus package. Single Amer- 
icans who make between 
575.000 andS150,000 will 
receive $600; $1,200 will 
go to couples, with an 
additional $300 for every 
child. Workers who do not 
earn enough to pay taxes 
but have earned more 
than S3.000 will receive 



roughly S300. Don't fiet; 
no one is getting paid 
until May or lune. By 
then I cannot imagine 
how much gas will cost 
- maybe S3.20? Prices 
always skyrocket in the 
summer; we might even 
seeS3.50or$3.75, 

Gas is more than 
twice as expensive as it 
was five years ago. Food 
prices arc rising along 
with the cost of fuel for 
shipping and the re- 
sulting increased price 
of corn for ethanol. 
Instead of addressing 
these issues, Congress 
is throwing money ^t 
people — and it isn't 
even that much. 

1 equate this to giv- 
ing someone CPR for a 
stab wound. Congress 
ends up looking like idi- 
ots, and we feel a little 
less human. 

What is even more 
exciting is the noncha- 
lant way economists 
have gone around 
praising this misguided 
plan. 

Here's a fun quote: 
"While a stimulus pack- 
age will cost us, It's go- 
ing to cost us much less 



than doing nothing." That 
was Mark Zandi, chief 
economist of economy, 
com. That's right, he just 
made an argument that 
the expensive decision is 
better than nothing. 

The stimulus pack- 
age under debate right 
now is $150 billion, and 
Zandi predicted on CNN 
that even a mild recession 
would cost the United 
Stales $300 billion. 

Not only is this pack- 
age better than nothing, 
it's cheaper, too. If Con- 
gress is serious enough 
about righting the econo- 
my to throw real money at 
us, then they should make 
, fuel cheaper, or make food 
cheaper, or at least do 
something halfway mean- 
ingful, 

"You have to go hack to 
tlie Great Depression for 
something comparable" 
to the risks of financial 
meltdown that we have 
stacked right now, accord- 
ing to Nouriel Roubini in 
an article on newsweek.

sor of economics and in- 
ternational business at 
New York University.

Giuliani 
gambled 
it all on 
sunshine 
state 



By EDWARD NELSON 



After focusing his 
campaign on Florida 
for months, former New 
York Nfayor Rudolpli Gi- 
uliani is starting to feel 
the heat. Giuliani ne- 
glected to campaign in 
any of (he early caucuses 
and primaries, hoping 
tliat whatever success he 
had in the Florida prima- 
ry would build enough 
momentum to win many 
of the primaries set for 
Fehruary5, when over 20 
stales will participate. 

Giuliani's focus on 
Rorida may have corhe 
at too great a cost. Not 
vrinning any of the early 
primaries- cost Giuliani 
vital attention from the 
media and the voters. 

This lime last year, 
CNN reported lliat Giu- 
liani was by far the stand 
out candidate, whh [he 
support of 34 percent of 
Republican voters. Af- 
ter the recent success of 
his opponents John Mc- 
Cain and Milt Romney. 
Giuliani finds himself In 
fourdi place. 

Not only has Giuliani 
suffered from lack of ai- 
tenlion from the press, 
but information critical 
of him has been brought 
to voters' attention. 

He told MSNBC that 
he would not criticize the 
odier candidates unless 
they spoke ill of him, a 
characteristic he said set 
him apart from the other 
Republicans. However, 
Giuliani was recently put 
into a negative light when 
he denounced Sen. John 
McCain's policies in ftont 
ofai'lorida audience. 

Giuliani's speech 
broke the parly's "elev- 



entli commandment": 
thou shalt not speak ill 
of a fellow Republican. 
This statute was first pro- 
posed by Ronald Reagan 
to prevent candidates 
from injuring each oth- 
er's reputations during 
prestdennal primaries, 
which cost die GOP the 
election in 1964. 

Giuliani's support 
base does not appear to 
be very sturdy. He cites 
his success as New York 
City's mayor as evidence 
that he is hi to lead the 
nation, but it seems the 
people of New York ace 
not all behind him. The 
New York Times recently 
reported that the city 
has paid over S7 millioii 
in setding lawsuits and 
damages caused by Giu- 
liani's policies. 

In fact, his popularity 
has descended so much 
that he will be forced to 
fight McCain for the win 
in the state's upcoming 
primary. Other slalom 
like New Jersey ihai weri' 
supposed to be easy w\n\ 
Tor Giuliani are also be- 
ginning to favor other 
candidates. 

Recent polls from 
CNN, Gallop and others 
show the former mayor 
in fourth place for the 
Republican nomination, 
just ahead of controver- 
sial Texas Representa- 
tive Ron Paul. Perhaps 
most lellingly, Florida 
Gov. Charlie Crist, Sen. 
Mel Martinez (R-FL) and 
even the New York Times 
have all recently en- 
dorsed Sen. McCain. It 
seems lliat Giuliani's en- 
deavors in Florida were 
not wortli the losses he 
has suffered.

While candidates 

from both parties have 
been promoting them- 
selves as "agents of 
change," it appears that 
many Americans , would 
prefer more of the same. 
According to daia col- 
lected by http://www. 
realclearpoliiics.com, 
recent polls from CNN, 
Gallop, Reuters and other 
sources have Sen. Hillary 
Climon as the favorite for 
the Democratic nomina- 
tion. It appears that our 
nation is likely to face an- 
other four years of lead- 
ership from the Clinton 
family. 



Our country was 
founded by people flee- 
ing from a king but, 
somewhere along the 
way, Americans have lost 
their distaste for dynas- 
tic rule. 

For almost 20 years, 
there has been either a 
Bush or a Clinton in the 
White House. Most IPFW 
students have never vot- 
ed in a presidential elec- 
tion wihoui one on the 
ballot. Including George 
H.W. Bush's eight years 
as Vice President, a win 
for Clinton would resuU 
in an uninterrupted 32 
years of the Uvo families 
controlling the nation. 

These dynasties are 
nol a new phenomenon. 
America has a long histo- 
ry of political "repeals." 



lolin Adams was fol- 
lowed by his son, John 
Quincy Adams. James 
Madison was followed by 
his second cousin. Zach- 
ary Taylor. William Henry 
Harrison was followed by 
his grandson, Benjamin 
Harrison. 

Theodore Roosevelt 
was followed by his dis- 
tant cousin, Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt. In 
fact, according to the 
Franklin Roosevelt li- 
brary Web site, Roosevelt 
was relaied to n total of 
eight presidents, either 
by blood or by marriage. 

llie list of related 
members of Congress is 
even longer. From the 
Breckinridges to the Ken- 
nedys, the Rockefellers 
to tlie Van Rensselaers, a 



handful of elite families 
has long controlled much 
of our government. It 
seems that a well-known 
"brand name" is just as 
important in politics as

This year's Immer- 
sion Festival was full of so 
much Irish culture that 
one couldn't help but 
learn something. The Irish 
Catholic Mass performed 
by Reverend Sean R Kealy, 
C.S.Sp. was very interest- 
ing and performed mosUy 
in Gaelic- Celtic Rhythm 
Dancers performed tra- 
ditional Irish step dances 
and Roger Drawdy and the 
Fire starters performed a 
rock and roll show mixed 
\vilh iraditional Irish 
rhythms and instruments. 
I even caught up with Cao- 
imhe (pronounced KEE- 
vah) McNeil, the woman 
behind it all. 

Why did you starl the 
Irish Immersion Festival? 

I'm a member of Omi- 
cron Psi and one of our 
goals is to do charitable

Heath Ledger Found Dead 

But Batman is still coining out... right? 



VHl has debuted yet another reality T.V. show. 
Gone Country. I personally am astounded by the 
B-list celeb line up, which includes anywhere from 
Sisqo, yes, the singer of the "Thong Song" and even 
Maureen McCormick aka Marsha Brady. The show 
is quite pointless, it's just taking people who already 
can sing and turning them Into country music stars. 

Nicole Richie has recendy debuted her after-birth 
body and she is already back to being nearly invis- 
ible. 

Miley Cyrus, of Hannah Montana fame, has had 
some scandalous new photos leaked. The photos in- 
clude her in nothing but a pulled up tank-top and her 
undies, baring her stomach. Disney will most likely 
ignore the scandal, seeing as how everyone and their 
cousin has seen it's biggest star, Vanessa Hudgens, as 
naked as the day she was born. 

Britney Spears boyfriend, Adnan Ghalib, has been 
selling his boyfriend status lo places like Entertain- 
mentTonight. He has been featured in five minute in- 
terviews with the show for the last week, talking about 
everything from him loving her to saving voicemails 
from her. 

In other Britney news, her uncle has also spoke 
out about her. Claiming he's done cocaine with her 
and smoked pot a few times too. He also claimed 
she's tried nearly every drug, including meth. 

Someone, somewhere sparked the bright idea 
to turn The Jerry Springer Show into a musical. One 
can't wait to hear more about that. 

Amy Winehouse has FINALLY gone to rehab. Yes, 
you read right, REHAB. She entered an unidcndfied 
program to seek help earlier last week. 

Tori Spelling is supposedly pregnant again, and 
we will all get to watch every single step of the way 
thanks to Oxygen! 

Brangelina is supposedly pregnant still, but this 
time with twins - excitement!

Recently, Hollywood 
suffered from a majorloss 
of a fantastic actor. Heath 
Ledger, was found dead 
in his apartment in the 
SoHo disirici on Januarj'

have ruled out suicide or 
foul play, although claim- 
ing there were many pre- 
scription drugs found in 
the bathroom, including 
many sleep-aids, both 
over-the-counter and 
prescribed. The intial 



autopsy failed to find 
cause of death, but ir

Ledger fell in love with 
co-star Michelle Williams 
while filming Brokeback 
Mountain. They later be-

called it quits in early

This loss is ver&gt;' sad-

It's been agreed it's a trag-

AndeknOieipfw.edu 



The crilically ac- 
claimed play, The Vagina 
Monologues, vvil! be per- 
formed at IPFW on Feb. 1 
and 2 to commemorate 
the tenth anniversary of 
Eve En Bier's play. 

This event will be 
sponsored by IPFW Stu- 
dent Theatre Organiza- 
tion as well as by Voices 
Not Victims, an organiza- 
tion dedicated to bring- 
ing awareness of abuse 
and to bring empower- 
ment to women. 

The Vagina Mono- 
logues was a play written 
as a response to the guilt 
and embarrassment that 
women oftentimes asso- 
ciate with their bodies or 
their sexuality. 

The play features 
women from various 
ages, cultures, and ex- 
periences and has been 
translated into 45 differ- 
ent languages and per- 
formed in more than 1 19 
countries. 

IPFW students, staff, 
and faculty will be fea- 
tured in theperformance, 
A percentage of the prof- 
its will also be donated 
to the Fort Wayne Sexual 
Assault TVeatmenl Center 
as well as to Eve Ensler's 
V-day Campaign, which 
is a proposed day of re- 
membrance for victims 
of female sexual abuse 



and is also an effort to 
Slop violence against 
women worldwide. 

Audience members 
will also have an oppor- 
tunity to purchase Valen- 
tine's Day items or gifts 
suitable for any occasion 
from the local vendors 
and artisans who will be 
present at the perfor- 
mance. 

Vendors will be do- 
nating a percentage of 
their sales to The Sexual 
Assault TYeatment Cen- 
ter. 

The performances 
will lake place at 8 p.m. 
each night in the Waib 
Student Union Ballroom, 
with doors opening at 7 
p.m. 

Tickets can be pur- 
chased at the IPFW Wil- 
liams Theatre box office 
before the performances 
for $15 per ticket, and 
also for $20 at the door. 
Only cash and checks 
will be accepted. IPFW 
students receive a $3 dis- 
count with a student ID. 

James Valez, who is 
president of Student 
Theatre and is the direc- 
tor of the play, believes 
that presenting The Va- 
gina Monologues will 
put perspective on abuse 
and bring empowerment 
to victims. 

"This is a great way to 
bring awareness |of sex- 
ual abuse) to the IPFW 
and Fort Wayne com- 
munity, and is a a worth- 
while cause," Valez said.

When did you learn 
to use a toothbrush? 
Have you ever stopped to 
wonder whether or not 
the emergency room will 
take care of you? How 
about crayons - does 
ever)'body know how to 
use the colorful school 
staples? 

Consider the Mayan 
Mexico located on the 
Yucatan Peninsula. The 
village of Valladollid, is 
made up of mostly Ma- 
yan Indians who up until 
the early twentieth cen- 
tury, were still in a state 
of opposition towards the 
Mexican government. 

Due to their draivn- 
out resistance, these 
people are extremely 
poor and have limited 
access to some of the 
things (hey desperately 
need, such as medical at- 
tention. 

The International 
Medical Assistance, 

founded by doctors Ro- 
berto Rodriguez and 
Bruce W, Bonnell, sends 
teams of Chrisdan doc- 



tors and nurses to Mexi- 
co to a small hospital in 
Valladollid for two weeks 
at a time to give care to 
those who need it. 

Medical procedures 
include cleft lip and pal- 
let repair, tumor and 
laparoscopic gall blad- 
der removal and cataract 



Women 25 to 30 
years old come 
into the hospital 
ivith gallstones 
they have had 
for years. If the 
gallstones are 
not removed 
they can cause 
pancreatic in- 
fections, which 
are painful and 
lead to eventual 
death. 

On the first 
day of their trip, 
McGaffick said 
that there were 
about 500 Mayans wait- 
ing for consultations out- 
side the hospital by 7 a.m. 
During the two weeks 
she was there, they per-

the neck and jaw open a 
bit so they could breathe 
better [after surgery]," 
said Jill McGaffick, a Fort 
Wayne nurse who trav- 
eled to Valladollid last 
February. 

Although there are 
two operating rooms in 
the hospital, there is no 
real oxygen equipment 




for post operative use. 
Many of the operations 
performed are for chil- 
dren who have cleft lips 
or palates.

McGaffick recalled 
one boy who was feeling 
the tip of his crayon. He 
had never seen one be-

how to use it, according 
to McGaffick. However, 
she also noted how beau-

Coach Amie Ball's team overcame a 2- 1 deficit on 
Friday night on their way to a big win over number 
12 ranked George Mason; 30-19. 21-30, 26-30, 30-19, 
and 15-g. 

"We were pretty fortunate. Played really good tlie 
first sei, poorly two and three," Ball said. "But they 
went up and beat Loyola the next nighl so they are a 
pretty good team." 

Senior Brock Ullrich was big in 
the opening game with a pair of 
service aces. The Patriots never really 
contended in the rest of the opening 
game. 

George Mason hit .561 in the 
second game, screaming back into 
a match that seemed questionable 
early on. Junior Kyle Gramit led the 
. .. then undefeted Patriots in games two 

iSb ■ ^""^ three. By the end of the third. 

JE, with George Mason up 2-1, he had 

B ^jfth ammassed 20 kills. 

Gramit had a team high 23 kills for 
the match. 

Senior Ail-American CJ. Macias 
led the way with 23 kills, his best 
match of the year. Fellow senior lason Yhost added a 
near double-double of 1 1 kills and nine digs. 
Josh Stewart had 14 kills. 

'Certainly we are pleased ivith lason Yhost, 
especially since Josh Stewart started the year slow. 
And Graydon (Ainsworth) . our setter, has done a nice 
job so all of the pressure is not on CI," Ball said. 
Ainsworth had 56 assists. 

IPFW w\\\ play the Patriots two more times this 
season. 

On Saturday, it was another EIVA team, Butgers- 
Newark, that came and fell to the Mastodons. This 
time, it was a sweep for Bail's team; 32-30, 30-21, and 
30-20. 

"They are a rebuilding team and we came out and 
were pretty good the first set and we gol a little flat," 
Ball said. 

The Scarlet Knights, led by first year coach Karl 
France, seemed to let their frustrations get (he better 
of them throughout the evening. 

After a tough first game. IPFW came on strong in 
the second, allowing for Ball to go much deeper onto 
his bench than he had been able to do thus far in the 
young season. Part of that depth came fi-om always 
vocal team motivator Dan McNerny. 

"Dan has always been a key player for us. We 
are happy to get him in there a little bit more," Ball

noted. 

In the third game Saturday night, the senior came 
on strong playing setter. He had two kills, two digs, a 
pair of service aces and a solo block on the night. He 
also put up nine assists, including the game winner 
to fellow senior Steve Rogers. 

The Mastodons also got quality minutes from 
freshmen Daryl Shank and Ben Duckworth. 
Duckworth had a service ace and four digs, 

"Obviously our young kids are pushing our 
starters. They came in and played Rutgers better than 
the starters in diat third game," Ball said. 

This week, IPIW will only be in action once, 
visiting Quincy on Friday night. 

"Its match we should win which is kind ofthe kiss 
of death when you say that. We've struggled playing 
well over there." Ball said of visiting Qunicy. 

Ball said the team wll travel to Qunicy a day early 
for rest, so they are not going into the game straight 
off the bus. 

"It is a match we need to win." 

The team returns home February 16 against Park 
University after four road games.

set. falling to Michelle Liew, 6-0, 7-6 (2).

'Dons. All the singles matches were won in straight 
sets, except for No. 4 singles where senior Hanna 
Hager oudasted Uura Gonzales, 6-3. 4-6, 10-8. 

The 'Dons weren't as fortunate against die Lady 
Aces of Evansville. The day started off on a positive 
note, as IPFW took all die doubles matches. But, 
the only win the 'Dons could manage in the singles 
competition was at No, 1 where freshman Amy 
Recht topped Lisa Kawamoto in straight set, 6-4.

cause problems, espe- 
cially when the trans- 
lator leaves for lunch. 
Once when this 
happened, a man 
who had just received 
surgery near his eye 
was trying to commu- 
nicate with the medi- 
cal personnel about 
his new toothbrush 
and toothpaste. Af- 
ter much gesturing, 
[hey figured out that 
he was trying to find 
out how 
much

paste to 
apply to 
his inci- 
sion!

"There's so many 
peopleand they crowd 
in and they need help 

- it's scary," she re- 
called. Three to five 
hundred people wait, 
sitting very quietly for 
glasses, dentistry, and 
medicines. 

'Ever\'body we saw 
we gave vitamins to 

- especially folic acid 
for expecting wom- 
en," she said. 

Folic acid prevents 



the 



backs 
of cattle 
trucks 

or a bus, visiting vil- 
lages around the Yu- 
catan peninsula. On 
her trip, McGaffick 
stopped in ten villag- 




cleft lips and palates 
in unborn children. 
Prescriptions were 
given out in thirty day 
doses or more, espe- 
cially for those need- 
ing vitamins. 



"Some villages 
had electricity, most 
didn't," McGaffick 
said. "Most (of the 
people) live in huts 
and hammocks ... to 
stay off the fioor." 

Some people trav- 
eled four hours just 
to reach the hospital. 
She recalled one boy 
who arrived at Vall- 
adollid with a broken 
arm. 

The Mexican gov- 
ernment re- 
quires that 
patients in 
need of elec- 
tive surgery 
arrive with 
10,000 pe- 
sos in hand. 
Otherwise, 
they will 
. only per- 

I form sur- 

\._ gery if there 
-anr is 3 life or 

death situ- 
ation. This 
boy had had x-rays 
but no other care for 
his compound frac- 
ture. 

Some patients 
arrived ai Valladollid 




with their own bottles 
of IV medicine, tubes 
and bag. 

This is common 
practice; local phar- 
macies freely sell 
medicines that in the 
United States would 
require a prescrip- 
tion. 

In Mexico, a pa- 
tient comes with his 
own Zofran and Toro- 
dol {nausea and pain 
medication) for sur- 
gery. If it isn't all used 



during his stay, it will 
be used for another 
patient's. 

"It's something 
that once you see, 
you have to go again," 
said McGaffick, who 
will be returning to 
Valladollid February 
16 for a second two- 
week stay. She vrill 
be collecting t-shirts, 
crayons, small toys 
and travel-sized bot- 
tles of shampoo for 
the patients she treats.
