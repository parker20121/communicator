Students' Government elections, to commenceat 8 a.m. Tuesday, March 2. will 
be the start of the race for twenty-six elective officers in Students' Government. 
The presidential race is wide open ; with three teams of candidates at the starting 
gate: Cyndy Harris, with Mike McAlexander. Mark Warsco, with John Barnet, and 
;\likr m&lt; iin.ihii, with Mary Paige Greig will all be campaigning hard and last lur 
the presidential and VP slots. At this time, it appears that no one of the presuh-nli.tl 
contenders will have a full slate of candidates for the fourteen nl fires of the Student 
Senate, and ten offices of the Student Board of Governors (SUBOG). 

Every student should vote. There is absolutely no reason not too-il only 
requires one credit hour of registration at IPFW. 

The voting hours are 8 a.m. to 9: 15 p.m .Tuesday and Wednesday, March L'and

The 

Army Officer 

Citizen-Soldier' 

1775-1976 

(A Bicentennial Look At Army ROTC) 

The first officers of volunteer militia units in the rebellious New England 
colonies received their commissions through political connections or for raising 
companies of men. Many were not qualified for military leadership. 

When General George Washington took command of the colonial army on July 4, 
1775, in Cambridge, Mass., he found "...a mixed multitude of people here under very 
little discipline, order or government..." One of the new commander's first acts was 
to dismiss unqualified militia officers. 

But the general's dismissals did not have a lasting impact on the methods used 
for granting officer commissions during the Revolution. After the war, Washington 
sought the advice of friends on how to improve the quality of American military 
leadership. George Clinton, who later became a vice president of the United States, 
suggested that one college In each state should be responsible for officer training. 
Although Washington presented the proposal to Congress, it was not acted upon. 

The suggestion was based on precedents set during the Revolutionary War. In 
1777, students and faculty at the College of William and Mary In Williamsburg, Va„ 
formed their own militia unit. Other colleges in New York, New Jersey and 
Connecticut also raised companies of students to fight the British. 

Another staunch supporter of military instruction on the college campus was 
Thomas Jefferson. When he was organizing the University of Virginia, Jefferson 
proposed that the "students should be required to spend sometime learning military 
maneuvers and tactcs in general." 

It took several more years for military instruction to become a regular part of 
collegiate education. The concept took hold in 1819, when Captain Alden Partridge, a 
former superintendent of West Point, founded the American Literary, Scientific and 
Military Academy in Norwich, Vermont. The school's name was later changed to 
Norwich University. Partridge shared Jefferson's and other statesmen's beliefs that 
the best way to train officers was through a liberal arts education which included 
military studies. 

Gradually, the concept gathered support, until the National Defense Act of 1916 
formally created the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC). Since then, the 
civilian educated Army officers, the citizen-soldier, has proven his worth by 
answering the call to duty every time his country has needed him. 

Today, the majority of the Army's new second lieutenants come from the ranks 
of ROTC cadets. These officers are assigned not only to the Active Army, but to 
equally important roles in the Army Reserve and National Guard. 

Now, as throughout the nation's history, the U.S. Army and the American 
college campus are working together to provide the future leaders needed to defend 
and pursue the ideals of their forefathers.
