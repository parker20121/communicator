Activities Fee 

Referendum 
2 

The activities fee refetendum 
for 1971-72 will be mailed lo all 
students during the first week o[ Way. 
The referendum proposes a new 
fee structure to be scaled according 
to the number of hours a student will 
take. The new slniclurc would niao 
call for a diviaion of the fees, with 
separate activity and athletic fees. 
Presenil)' 85 of each students' 
815 au lorn ali cully goes toward the 
athletic fee. 

One advantage of the proposed 
fee structure is that persons interes- 
ted in part-time athletics or activi- 
ties would not be required to pay 
full fees, unless they arc enrolled in 
nine or more credit hours. 

A second advantage is that the 
fees of full-time students would be 
reduced from 815 per semesler to 89 

The proposed scale request a 
fee of 82 for activities nnd 81 for 
athletics for students enrolled in 
1-4 credit hours. This would admit 
the student to three activities and 
one athletic event. 

For students enrolled in 5.8^ 
hours, the fee would be 84 for acti- 
y ties nnd 52 for athletics, permitting 
participotion in 6 activities and 
2 intramurals. 

Students enrolled in nine or 
more hours would pay 86 for octivi- 
tics and 83 for athletics and would 
be admitted to all events. 

Part time students may opt to 
purchase larger activity cards.

I believe it is time to give you 
some helpful criticism of the news- 
paper. I do believe thai ike people 
on the newspaper staff cannot count. 
Although all the pages were not num- 
bered, I guessed thai the pages ap- 
peared in this order: I, 8, 3. 4. 9, 10, 
n, 6, 7, 2, 5, 12. Now when I read 
an article on page 7 and it is sup- 
posed to be continued on page 8, I 
like to be able to turn the page to 
finish the article. I don't like to 
search the paper in order to finish 
the article. Maybe our staff should 
be required to watch Sesame Street. 
With a little effort, they may learn 
2 follows I, not 7. 

Sincerely, 
Craig Chaney 
Dear Craig, 

Yeah, we know—except our 
printer didn't. No lie! You can come 
in and check our lay-out sheets if 
you want. We weren't exactlj' over- 
joyed with it either. But face it: even 
if you didn't like to search through 
the paper for continuations, at least 
you did, which shows that you are a 
kind and warm-hearted newspaper 
lover.

Sincerely, 
The Editor 



As the time of student gov- 

for this year, I feel inclined to 
comment abaul the slali 'of our 
campus and its representative 

I am a senior this year and 
have been observing the campus 
political body since / began in 
college. This observation has led 
me to one main conclusion: that 
the students' government- has, 
for all intents and purposes, been 
basically ineffective. One of the 
duties of a government is to fight 
for the rights and try to improve 
the conditions of its constituents; 
in our case the students. Our 
campus government has not effec- 
tively done this. 

In order that someone won't 
answer this letter by accusing 
me of being fast another apathetic, 
complaining student with no 
business writing this letter as 
he has never been involved, let 
me slate some of the things I 
have done here on campus. 

I was Business Manager of 
the campus newspaper for a sem- 
ester, and Seniors Editor of oar 
nou' defunct yearbook for a sem- 
ester. I uas also involved in • 



Project Abelard heavily ini-oUed 
in the fight against paid parking 
and the bookstore policies, and 
am currently a member of the 
Campus Publications Board. 
But lei lis lum now to the 
reasons why the students' gov- 
ernment has not been able to 
function to its full capacities. 
Actually there is only one reason: 

the students that the government 
is trying to represent. The stu- 
dent body here at Our Regional 
Campus has shown an amazing 
disregard and disrespect for the 
job the students' government is 
trying to do for them. Our student 
government cannot function effec 
lively unless and until the students 
rid themselves of their apathetic 
altitudes and block our representa- 
tives. The administration here at 
the campus is very congnizant 
of the .fact that the students in no 
way back their representatives and 
use this fact when dealing with 
our student government. It is very 
easy ifor one group to overstep 
its bounds in its relations with 
a second if the second group 
does not have the support of 
its people. This is the problem the 
students' government has: the 
the students don't give a damn. 
Until this campus and its 
students grow up and rid them- 
selves of their idea of this uni- 
versity as a hamburger-stand 

drives in, goes to class, and drives 
home, remaining totally uncon- 
cerned about the life of the institu- 
tion, they will continue to remain 
second class members of this 
. campus community, and the 
students' government will have 
a long uphill battle trying to fight 
for the students. I commend the 
students' government for their 
efforts to this point, and hope 
the students wilt soon wake up 
and back their government, making 
it much more effective in the 
future. 

■Yours truly, 
Tom Henning

The expansion ot student government into ocuilcmic offiiirs mid univer- 
sity gaverniince arc, by for, the most significant of the nciv underi&gt;ikings gf 

Many of the nclivilics of the past year have been geared to the csi.ili. 

lishmcnl of contact and rapport with the student body. \Vc buvx- iiitiHianlk 

ate. Throughout the year, Ihc number of students seeking to ulili/.' the ser- 
vices of student government has steadily increased. 

■\lthough most of these issues were not raised in the current elet'lion 
campaign, 1 hope that the victorious candidates will utilize mnny i&gt;r theair 
programs as a basis from which to build n stronger student government. 

The year has been enormously busy and often frustrating. The true 
consequence of the year's activities cannot be measured immediiitelvi 
Many ot those important programs which we have labored over arc not com- 
pleted. The Student Bill o( Rights and Responsibilities and the Campus 
Parliament must be pursued to completion by the new student governmenl 
administration. These projects may reap great rewards for students— if 
they arc aggressively pursued. 

The programs which my administration implemented have been many: 
however, these is one area ia which we did not realise our potcniiul and in 
which we were unable to fulfill our obligation to the student body. That area 

ersighl; we simply lacked the tools to effectively lobby for student support, 
'I slressi the word "effectively" as in the courscof the year over IfiO.OOO 
sheets of paper were used in an attempt to inform students. 

Prospects for next year are not clear at this time. No matter who w'lw- 
the election, the incoming administration has already lost valuable limr 
by not familiarizing the members of that administration with the issues fa, 
cing student government. I sincerely hope that the winners of the elcctiim 
utilize our efforts ond accomplishments to build a more effective and more 
broadly representative student governmenl for ncKi year.

never were too good at remembering 
dates— right? 

For the inrormatjon of those of 
you who had forgotten about that 
"incident" this week will be the 
first anniversary of the murder of 
the four. The four (Allison Krause, 
19, a freshman from Pittsburg; 
Jeff Miller, 20, transfer student to 
Keiit Stale; Sandy Schever, 20, 
a speech-therapy major from Young- 
stown, Ohio; Bill Schroeder, |9. 
a sophomore majoring In psychology 
attending Kent State on a ROTC 
scholarship) were martyrs for the 
right to protest. 

Perhaps a brief history of the 
massacre and surrounding events 
are appropriate at this time; Or 
April 30 President Richard HHhous 
Nixon announced that 20,000 U.S. 
servicemen had been sent Into 
Cambodia. Upon this announcement 
protest demonstrations on colleges 
throughout th« nation were organ- 
ized. On Hay |. at Kent State about 
2,000 students met at noon to bury 
the U.S. Constitution. In the evening 
the National Guard was brought in.

Injured (two of them later died froii 
their injuries). At least the English 
brought the ten murder 
and found them guilty of mansUugh- 
ter. But in our "great society" the 
murderers weren't even indicted. 
How, in our modern society, 
can we let murderer^ wander around 
Have we become so hard 
murder fails to affect us? 
How can we simply brush this "con- 
frontation" aside? Many excuses 
have been used; "They were a bunch 
of radicals." Schroeder was atten-

larship. "They asked for it," 
Throwing stones cannot be equated 
with firing Into a crowd of unarmed

ore Icchnieally free from slavery 
they arc still bound by "psycholog-

Many whites say that Ihcy

educated before the time of Christ," 
says Bryant. Only lately have the 
important black figures in history 
been brought out. Bryant says 
blacks" "history and culture has 
been stolen from us." 

Another myth is the while 
fear that blacks are out to take 
white jobs. All blacks want is the

begin to match the whites dollar
