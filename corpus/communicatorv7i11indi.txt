A more lasting and dignified, way, we say. 

Since our foundation in 1859, this has been the 
Saleslan way. Education is the keynote. What good is a 
meal today when one must think of all the tomorrows? 
St. John Bosco knew this well. What good are dreams 
unless they are translated in reality by deeds? 

Around the world, Saleslan missioners hBlp their 
flock by giving them ways to help themselves. Whether It 
is agricultural training or technical training for a trade 
(hey can learn, people are encouraged to find their 
own niche, their own way of betterment, their own road 
to human dignity and self help. 

Salesians work primarily for youth, for it Is in the 
young that hope is born. There are Saleslan missions In 
73 countries around the world. If you are Interested
