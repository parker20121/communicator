Catchup 
in 6 tough weeks. 



If you missed the first 2 years of 
Army ROTC, you can make it up in 
our 6-week Basic Camp. 

Frankly, it's tough. You cram a 
regular 2-year course into 6-weeks. 
That'll keep you hopping. You'll earn 
over $500.00 plus travel allowance. 

There's no obligation for taking the 
Basic Camp. In fact, you can quit any 
time you like (but over 90% finished 



last year's camp.) 

Then, return to college and go into 
the Advanced Course. You'll get $100 
a month and earn a commission while 
you're earning your degree. 

The Basic Camp is open for men and 
women. Check it out. It's one summer 
you'll never forget!
