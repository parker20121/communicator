Cold air moves into Midwest 



WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —A biller-

things lo come in ihe new season for 
Mldwesterners, says a Purdue 
University professor. 

Tnough many early reports predicted 

point to evidence thai ll's going lo be 
cold — and Slay cold — for much of the 
winter season, says geoscienccs 
Professor Ernest Agee. 



The presence of a heavy snow cover 
usually breeds more cold weather by- 
reflecting more of the sun's radiation 
away from ihe surface of the earth, he 

"Snow can reflect BO percent of the 
sun's radiation, compared lo 20 percent 
normnlly reflected by the bare 
ground." says Agee. "This loss of beat, 
in I urn, works lo cool Ihe lower part of 
the atmosphere, generating a con- 
tinuing source region for cold air. 

"Further, the southern boundary of

1984 marks 20th 



With the beginning of the new year 12 
days ago. IPFW began ils year-long 
celebration of the school's 20th an- 
niversary . 

In November of 1964 Lyndon Johnson 
had just been elected president and in an 
occasion of less national significance, a 
new building was dedicated on the 
northeast side of Fort Wayne. Thai 
building, now known as Alfred W 
Kettlcr Hall, was the original campus, 
and home of the joint university center. 

3,100 students were enrolled then. 
Today, about 10.000 students are 
enrolled in nearly SOU degree programs. 

At that time, Indiana and Purdue had 
separate administrations at Fori 
Wayne. The Iwo schools also had 
separate admissions of rices and various 
other offices and departments Today, 
one administration oversees the cam- 
pus. Any student, regardless of which 
school he is enrolled in, may take almost 
any class offered by the other school. 

Many of the original sludenls at IPFW 
20 years ago probably wouldn't 
recognize the campus today.

Moses files suit 



Mayor Winfield Moses, acting as a 
private citizen, has filed a suit in the U.S. 
Dislricl Court in Fori Wayne, charging 
Ihe slate's license branches practice of 
making political contributions to (he 
parly controlling Ihe governor's office, 
unconstitutional 

Rep. Phyllis Pond of New Haven, a 
Republican, has introduced legislation 
into Hie General Assembly calling for 
the license branches lo be operated by 
Ihe stale and nol Ihe Republican Party. 

Both politicians should be com- 
mended. The license branches should 
never have been controlled by one party 
in the (irel place. When people drive 
their cars, they do so as private citizens, 
not as members of one political parly. 

If a person wants to contribute to a 
certain political parliGet him do it 
voluntarily, not through the guise of a 
driver's license. 

Reaction to Moses' suit by the 
Republicans has been typically against. 
Gov, Roberl Orr said the suit was 
"political." Allen County Republican 
Chairman Orvas Beers said Moses is 



"jumping on the legal bandwagon " 

The suit contends Ihe practice or in- 
direclly forcing motorists to contribute 
to a political party violates their rights 
under the First, Ninth and Fourteenth 
Amendments to the Constitution, 

In her bill, Pond would like all money 
received by the license branches to be 
turned over lo Ihe Bureau of Motor 
Vehicles, and for Ihe employees to be 
state employees receiving benefits as 

Currently the branch keeps a portion 
of Ihose fees to cover operating cosls. 
and sends a portion of any balance to 
stale and local political committees. 
Records of the State Election Board 
reveal that the three branches in Allen 
County contributed 526,843 lo Ihe stale 
Republican committee in 1982 and 
$27,439 lo the Allen County Republican 
committee in 1982. 

Hopefully Ihe practice will end. 
Neither political parly should be 
receiving that kind of money from 
something thai should be operated by 
ihe stale.
