Vietnam veterans talk about their participation in the war in light of 
current developments in southeast Asia. Also, a former Port Wayne 
resident shares some thoughts on her participation in the American 
airlift of war orphans from Saigon. Details on page 3. 

Purdue-Indiana Theatre receives some coverage this week on the 
entertainment page. Award-winner Dan Butler, the Family Theatre 
Festival, and PIT'S participation in the Fine Arts Festival are covered 
in articles by Michael Snyder. Brenda Merkel. and Susan Morrison.

The SUB's 1975 



. t festival is just around the corner. 

Student Union Board chairman Mike Yarm anil I roups have promised a full day 
of entertainment for a one dollar parking "donation " Vann has explained 
subsequent to his first statement thai the lee is nol really a parking fee but an 
admission fee to the rock concert on Saturday. 

This is all very confusing isn't it?

reach the goal without cliareann Hie admission fee lo the concert. 

But this is nol fair to students who have paid lor an activity card and .are 
therefore paving for Ihc festival with these monies. Those students and 
rinn-sKiiSi-i Ms who do nol own an activity card should pay sonic admission fee 

We suggest Ihose who have paid the activity lee nol pay the .sum requested by

We often receive verbal complaints lluoiijdioiil Ihc year about particular 
instructors Sometimes we are personally familiar with a situation where a 
professor is somehow (ailing in his or her duties Reasons for the failure seem to 
vary from cose to case. 

Sometimes, instructors are knowledgeable but liable In commiinilcale that 
knowledge In their students. Others are so heavily involved in extracurricular 
activities ur movements thai ihey either can't or won't teach the subjects they are 
being paid to teach. 

Still others arc just not interested in I he welfare of I heir students; some 
atlempl lo revolutionize I lie present grading system at the expense of those 
students who must live with it lor the resl ol their academic careers. .lust one 
example el this was the resignation lasl year ol an Knglish instructor after she had 
given all ol her comp students blanket "A"s to prolesl (he university grading 
system Those students who bad difficulty in later Kngbsh classes because they 
had nol learned much in freshman comp can allesl lo the fuel (hat her "protest" 

More recently, we have learned ol an instance where a professor reacted to 
criticism niwhal some si udents judged In be "excessive" mil of class assignments 
by further increasing the work load and banassmg the critical students. 

If the net result of a professor's extracurricular activities, disinterest, or 
didacticism is the short -changing ot his or her students, those si udents have a right 
U&gt; object In some of the cases brought lo us, the sluilcnls involved reported success 
afler discussing, the situation with Ihc professor's department chairman or an 
administrator. Others feared "going over the instructor's head" because of 
recrimination or puiiishinenl lor their action. 

This "punishment" might take the form of increased work load, verbal 
intimidation ol the si in lent in class, lowered gi ados, or oilier hanassmcnl. There is 
no excuse for this kind of treatment being meted out to sludents in any class. 

Although The Communicator attracts slaff members with many different 
majors and hum many different divisions, it is impossible for us lo lie aware ol (he 
leachcr-stndeiil relationship in every class offered each semester It any students

Instructors, whether Ihey have a It. A. or Ph 11 , should remember that they 
have a responsibility lo Ibeir sludents as well as lo I he university No one wishes to 
curtail academic freedom, but students who are paying lor classes have a right to 
expect their money's worth They arc not paving for busy work, intimidation, or 
neglect.
