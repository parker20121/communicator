Bomb threat evacuates Kettler 



Ry KmtleSchlundl 
Slafr Writer 

LasI week Ihe regional campus ex- 
perienced a bomb scare. An anony- 
mous caller told ihe Fori Wayne Fire 
Deparlmenl that bombs were planted 
al Ihe Regional Campus and Sainl 
Francis College. 

This resulted in an evacuation of 
the buildings. The alarm bell rang 
and many people, thinking il was only 
afire drill, left ihe building with their 
books, purses, brie/cases, elc , still 
inside. Once Ihey walked outside, 
ihey discovered that the campus 
would be closed for an hour or more. 
The students made the best of it, 
though, by studying on the lawn, 
leaving, or playing football uncon- 
cernedly on Ihe lawn. 

The Fort Wayne police deparlmenl, 
fire department, and Ihe university 
staff members seated Ihe building, 
and Ihe 50 searchers combed the en- 

Volunteers 
help library

Volunteers have saved the Helmkc Li- 
brary staff 1346 hours of labor and 
$13,460.0(1 in tosts for the 1992-93 aca- 
demic year, 

According to Judith Violcitc, Hcimke 
Library assistant direcior, people who 
volunteer lo help in the difCcrcni areas 
of ihc library have given invaluable help 
in administration, circulation, govern- 
mem documems, documcnl delivery, 
preservation, and other departments. 

The library volunteer program began 
as soon as the IPF\V volunieer program 
was iniiiaicd icn years ago under the di- 
rection of Pauline Flynn. Jobs may ^c 
short-term tasks, such as prepiiring j 
mailing or photocopying documents. 

"We have foiwd out that some people 
arc wilting 10 be irained 10 do some 
rather complicated things." said Vio- 
leite. These include computer program- 
ming and book preservation. 

To repair a damaged book, for e»am- 
ple, the cover is removed, the glue is 
scraped off, and a new cover is prcpirecl 
10 make the book look like new. 

"We save a loi of money, not just in 
manpower but in binding, thanks to the 
volunteers," Violetlc added. 

Most volunteers are retired though 
people of all ages have offered their ser- 
vices. Violetlc said a young woman 
worked in various departments to see il 
she wanted to apply 10 library school. 

High school students have also greatly 
helped to fuinil service commitmcni 
hours in a non-profit insiiiuiion. Many 
of the volunteers have worked at the li- 
brary for several yeare. 

Maiy Van Drew, a school teacher for- 
merly of Frankc Park Elementary 
School, wanted something to do after 
she retired. She has been helping at ilnj 
library for three years in several dejian- 
mcnis. Every Monday she assists 
Pauline Hunsbergcr, reference and 
archives librarian, in book preservation. 

"1 have really enjoyed working with 
Pauline Hunsbergcr.— she's a wonderful 
person," said Van Drew. 

Arthur Beal, Yale hisioiy graduate and 
Tcuree from die Goodyear Tire conipj- 
ny, has been an IPFW volunteer for sev- 
eral ycaK. He found out about the vol- 
unteer pingram dirough a newspaper ai-

research for professors in die histoo', 
political science, and madi dcpanmenis 

Deal's Jobs al the library include filmg

Since his leiircmcni IS years ago.

While this story seems to relate a 
recent incident, this particular bomb

On Tuesday of this week, at approx- 
imately 2:30 p.m., another bomb 
scare disrupted classroom and student 
activities in Kettler Hall. The build-

classes resumed as soon as it was de-

re -enter. 

Tuesday's bomb scare was the sec-

Yet every semester, and particularly 
at mid-icrm and on finals week, 
anonymous callers continue to harass 
university staff and students with liic- 
some bomb threats. 

Suspects in these threat incidents 
could face criminal charges. Chief 
DenHanog emphasizes (hat any sus- 
pect in these crimes will be prosecut-

state law, and if applicable, federal 
charges will be levied. 

Marian Zimmerman, dean of Stu- 
dents, warns that IPPV students who 
are suspected of involvement in the 
bomb scares violate the Student Code 
of Conduct. 

Disciplinary sanctions against a stu- 
dent found guilty of involvement in 
bomb threat incidents could include 
in any combination: reprimand and 
warning, disciplinary probation, resti-

Communicator editor 
establishes tradition 



By Krlstte Schlundt 
Staff Writer and 
Felicia Ueeching, 
Editor In Chief 

When Jennifer Bosk completed her 
editorship of The Communicator in 
May 1971, Ihc survival prospects for 
Ihe campus paper were grim. In fact. 
several student newspapers with dif- 
ferent names had come and gone at 
the young IPF\V campus, 

"They (faculty and administration! 
kept telling me that it would never 
last. In fact, many faculty were op- 
posed to Ihc campus having a smdcnt 
newspaper." said Bosk. 

Tlie Communicator was bom in re- 
sponse to B 1969 summer survey in 
which incoming freshmen expressed 
an interest in a campus newspaper. 
Sophomore Steve Huddlcston became 
editor in chief of the new paper, but 
he resigned after only six weeks. 

Jennifer Bosk, the assistant editor at 
Ihe time, assumed his duties. She 
spent the next two years as ihc editor 
in chief, an unpaid position thai of- 
fered neither praise nor rccogniuon, 

"The Communicator was accused of 
having a 'militant altitude' back 
then.. I spent a lot of iime in Deans' 
(rfTiccs because of content [of the arti- 
cles printed)." Bosk recalls. "Some- 
times we fell like everyone was for 
us. and somciimcs wc felt like every- 
one was agaimi us." 

In addition 10 ihe faculty oppositJon 
toward the paper. Bosk continues. 
"the Student Go\'cmmeni hid our pa- 
pers if wc printed things they didn't 
Ukc." 

"All funding was cut one semester 
in an attempt to control (die conicnt|. 
and we went underground." Bosk re- 
flects, 

lATien Bosk managed the paper, "We 
did all our own lypcsetling, and we 
did stick-on teitering fw headlines." 

Bosk recalls ihat her staff had to 
spend the entire night editing, and tin- 
kering with page la&gt;-oui and lypeict- 



ling. Then they would rush the paper 
to Ihc Greyhound bus station and send 
the paper on its way to the piintcr in 
Angola. The bus line made a regular 
Slop in Angola and delivered it for 
The Communicator staff. 

After stepping down from being edi- 
tor in May 1971, Bosk weni 10 ID 
Bloomington the following fall, but 
rctumed in 1972 to many and have a 
family. 

In 19B4, Bosk became an unem- 
ployed single parent wiih three chil- 
dren. She decided to return to IPFW 
and finish her uncompleted degree in 
communications. 

Confident in her wriung skills. Bosk 
began publishing the New Haven 
News in 1985. In 1987 die paper ex- 
panded and named the New Allen 
News. Bosk sold the paper in June 
1991. Under its new ownership, tlie 
paper she founded is called The Allen 
County Times. 

Bosk began other publications as 
well: she was responsible for the cir- 
culation of newsletters and similar 
publications for several area organiza- 

Today. Bosk works in the field of 
public relations. She is currently em- 
ployed as the director of marketing 
and public relations ai Saint Francis 
College. 

Ironically, Saint Francis College has 
no student newspaper. 

Bosk and her former CommunJcaur 
staff still keep in touch. In fact, the 
group met for their ten year reunion in 
1979. 

Bosk relates that she feels a sense 
of ac«)mplishmcni whenever she sees 
^ copy of die campus paper. 

"1 always read The Communicai^ 
whene'&gt;^ I'm on campus. I get a tim 
out of the fact that it's still Brouni^ 
said Bosk. "We fought for a studenP 
newspaper on this campus and we

Area tales 
show quirks 

By Krislie Schlundt 
Staff Writer 

In Fort Wayne, our fondness for bend- 
ing a visitor's ear is exceeded only by 
our fondness for embellishing the truth 
of stories about some of Indiana's most 
Lulorful characters, such as Johnny Ap- 
plesccd. Chiefs Little Turtle and 
TiLLumsch. General "Mad" Anthony 
Wayne, John Dillinger. and of course, 
Bobby KnighL 

Fori Wayne residents willingly chat 
with oui-of-towners about the austere 
Amish folk who live in the niral com- 
munities surrounding the city. We even 
smile good-naturedly when we inform 
the inquisitive diat glacial movement 
accounts for most of the one hundred- 
pius lakes in our odierwise uninterest- 
ing Nonheasiem Indiana topography. 
But our patience ends here. 

Some of the historical characters and 
cvenLs continue to entertain us. Some 
of the facts. Ihe lore, and the bits of 
Americana we've collected over the 
generations continue to fuel our fancy. 
Bui, when we explain to someone for 
Ihe umpteenth lime that there is no 
summit per se in die "Summit City." 
ihat Fort Wayne merely marks die high- 
est point above sea level along a canal 
route dial no longer exists; when wc be- 
gin for the nineiy-milliondi time lo say. 
"No. Fort Wayne is NOT a military 
base ..." — when we encounter these 
all-ioo-familiar aspects of Fort Wayne 
hisior&gt;'. we then truly appreciate litde 
known facts about Fort Wayne and the 
surrounding area like diose that follow. 
• T\\i streets and alleys of Fort Wayne 
jre filled with untold treasures; I'm 
sure you guessed il — manhole covers. 

In 1988 Kaduyn Moore of Leo. Indi- 
ana published a book in which she doc- 
uments the many mardiole covers in 
Fon Wayne, and die foundries which 
made them (See Moore. Kathiyn. Man- 
hole Covers of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Ft 
Wayne: Moore. 1988) The book 
traces the fascinating evoluiion of the 
manhole cover, from individual works 
of an to standardized utilitarian covers. 
Moore even provides copies of the rub- 
bings taken fiom the area manhole cov- 



sentcd with

Ihc program is lo provide the regional 
campus with a spectator sport that of- 
fers spirited competition al an intercol- 
legiate level and to offer hope to those 
seeking eventual NCAA recognition." 
Leonard, along with coaches David 
Skelton and Wanen Wonhlcy, and the 
team members fought adversity to get 
ihis athletic program off the ground. 
They did everydiing, including wash- 
ing thcunifomis. 



The team practiced ai odd hours any- 
where they could fmii a gym. whether 
early mornings at 6 a.m. or late at 
night at 9 p,mi Workouts might be at 
the Slate School Gym one day, the Ar- 
mory Ihc nent day, or the old Indiana 
Tech Gym on another day. They rarely 
had all ten players available on any 
given game day because classes came 
first. 

"Wc went wherever wc could find a 
place to play; we were gypsies," said 
Leonard, 

They once traveled to Michigan City 
to play Purdue North Central at the 
state penitentiary because the prison 
system provided travel money to the 
team and cnicnainmcni to ihc inmates.

lieve it or not, Moore is not alone in her

Black balled 

Racial injustice still 
exists in pro sports 



Since Jackie Robinson broke 
baseball's color barrier in 1947, 
American spons increasingly has 
become an example of positive 
racial coopcralion. On the playing 
Held, ihc cliche goes, all mccs are 
equal — only individual ability 
ninitcrs. 

Bui professional spons in particu- 
lar has never fully lived up to this 
ethos. Too few blacks are coaching, 
managing, or leading icams on the 
field. We gladly add our voice to 
the chorus of outrage about the 
treatment of blacks in major sports. 

The National Football League ac- 
lualy believes fans will nor pay lo 
see black quarterbacks lead their 
home team. To date, only eight of 
the leagues' 28 teams have ever 
had a black quarterback on their 
ler, altltough half of the players 
in Ihe league arc black. Warren 
Moon. Randall Cunningham, and 
Rodney Pcetc — today, some of the 
finest field leaders in the NFL — 
were all snubbed when ihey came 
out of college. Moon was forced to 
play in Canada because no one 
here wanted him, Pcete. who fin- 
ished second in Heisman Trophy 
balloting his senior year, wasn 'i se- 
lected unii\^t1ie sniih'rOiiniJ'or'liie 
NFL draft, behind several marginal 
prospects, 

Major League Baseball has had 
only five black managers in its his- 
tory; the NFL has had only, two 
black head coaches. Given that sor- 
ry record, the racism wc need to 
complain about is not Marge 
Schoit's petty slurs, but rather the 
endemic prcjuilice that's preventing 
blacks from even getting a chance 
to coach. 

We arc generally not sympatJietic 
to gratuitous cries of racism. It is 
one of the most abused, and abu- 
sive, terms in the public discourse. 
When, for example, the claim is 
heard that "racism" accounts tor 
the shortage of black professors on 
campus, it is first necessary to look 
at the applicant pool. Arc there 
enough qualified black candidates 
for jobs teaching physics or mathe- 
matics, or even political science? 

The answer, sadly, is no. 

There arc an abundance of quali- 
fied black athletes and coaches. 
however. Thai these men don't get 
the chance to reach the highest lev- 
els of their professions is one of the 
most flagrant expressions of racism 
that survives in America. 

.But Ihc professional leagues arc 
just perpetuating a system whose 
flaws take root much earlier. Too 
many high schools, already shon- 
changing the majority of students, 
give an especially short-shrift to 
student athletes. Sports star are 
even more likely than their peers to 
pass through the educational sys- 
tem barely functional at math and 



reading. 

Colleges then rccmii marginally- 
literate studenLs. pretend to educate 
them for four years, and leave them 
without a degree or prospect for a 
job. Schools need to stop using 
sports only as a fundraising device, 
and put the "student" back in stu- 
dent athlete. The National Colle- 
giate Association, one of the most 
shamelessly self-interested organi- 
zations in the country, ought to 
scrap its silly rules that prevent 
jocks from even holding a part- 
time job while the universities use 
them as unpaid, fult-iime athletes. 
The schools rake in millions of dol- 
lars on the backs of these young 
men. who sec noi a penny in return. 
The NCAA and the higher educa- 
tion establishment counter by say- 
ing tliat these kids receive a "free 
education." Well, anyone who has 
attended college in the last decade 
or so knows that ain't worth spit. 

Professional football and basket- 
ball need to stop exploiting the free 
labor pool provided by universities, 
and invest in their own minor- 
league systems. Thai way. aihleies 
who aren'i qualified to go to col- 
lege won't waste four years at a 
.second-rate school just to get a 
'slim chance to play professional 
ball. After a couple of years in the 
mintJrs. they will know just where 
they stand— and ihcy won't be 
working for free, either. 

This corrupt system was not cre- 
ated to hold down blacks in partic- 
ular, but it does Impact dispropor- 
tionately on black athletes who rely 
on spons as their sole opportunity 
for personal uplift. It is tragic that 
so many young black men see no 
other future. College and pro sports 
should be ashamed for manipulat- 
ing these kids' despair. 

All of this begs one important 
question: where arc die pro athletes 
and big-name coaches themselves 
in this discussion? Multi-million- 
aires who have managed through 
talent and luck to make the system 
work for themselves have a special 
responsibility to the generation that 
follows. Before more young men 
gel sucked into the black hole of 
college sports to be used and cor- 
rupted by the self-righieous bandits 
who run the NCAA, the pro ath- 
letes of today must take a vigorous 
stand against the exploitation ^d 
the greed — otherwise, they are just 
as guilty as the college administra- 
tors and the pro owners. Jackie 
Robinson, who never forgot his 
duly as a public figure to do the 
right thing is a fllting role for to- 
day's egocentric, over-paid mcgas- 
lars.

Letters to the editor 

Take environmental concerns seriously 



To the editor: 

When the USA Today featured the 
headline, 'M.eoo OWLS vs. 32,100 
JOBS," in their Apnl 1. 1993 edition. 
I thought, "Hey, now there's a story!" 

All that day, I spoke to students 
who were on different sides of the is- 
sue. This is qncoE:the "really big 
deals" for America today. President 
Clinton and Vice-President Gore held 
an Environmental Summit trying to 
hammer out the horrible situation for 
our ancient forests. 

White man is really stupid. My lab 
instructor said it the other day. 
"While man has never learned. The 
Indians took great care of the earth. 
The while man only knows how to 
destroy everthing in his path." 



We've got to get hard on ourselves! 
Imagine a world where you never 
hear the hooi of a spotted owl! What 
if you never see a tree again? You 
rush to the libray, but all the books on 
u-ccs have been checked out or stolen. 
Bookstores con'i keep up wiih the or- 
ders for books about trees. Sure,;this 
may sound extreme, but the time will 
come. Maybe not for you — but what 
about future generations? Don't they 
have a right to hug a tree? WAKE UP 
PEOPLE!!! This is your life! 

Okay, hugging a tree may be a little 
bit funny. I admit it's odd. Guess 
what? I hug tiees every chance I get! 
Ask my friends, they'll turn me in. I 
also know that the great poet 
Theodore Roethke felt the eanh move 



beneath him; plus, Walt Whitman 
bathed in the sunshine and waters of 
the earth. These people weren't in- 
sane. They just understood ttic impor- 
tance of balance between nature and 
human beings. 

Please don't throw paper out your 
car window. There's no reason to take 
hour long showers. If you like sex in 
the shower. I'm sorry, try the kitchen 
table. Turn out the light if you're not 
in the room. Find out which compa- 
nies recycle and work for the envi- 
ronment. All it takes is a little re- 
search. If the company hurts the 
earth, write them a leiier and stop us- 
ing their product. Insn'thardU 

The reason why I've decided to 
write this letter is because of what 



happened today. I was taking some 
viiicos back to the video store and I 
watched a young boy crinkle up some 
paper and throw it in the air iikc he 
was making a basket. Then he just 
walked on with his friends, enjoying 
the beautiful sunshine of the day. I 
wanted to kill him! It killed to sec the 
future generation doing what my gen- 
eration did! There wasJiD thought or 
care, just mindless living. It's disgust- 
ing! We are a nation of idiots. We are 
the walking dead, lelting the big boys 
in Washington spoon feed us our 
lives. It is a choice. Iidoes matter, 

Please love the earth — reduce. 
reuse, recycle.

Diary of a IVlad Graduate

so hard to believe. 

My son is nm too pleased. I'm steal-

to a bachelor's degree by two years. I 
was begirming to wonder about that. 

February 1993 — I've been here 
for so long that people I've never 
seen before nod and speak to me in 
die halls. They've seen me so much 
they think -I'm a permanent fixture 

March 1993 — Just think, no more 
hassles with closed classes. No more 
circling parking lots for ages and 
then, being late for class. No more 
waiting in u-afiic for a line of geese to 
cross the street. No more being fnis- 
trated in my research at the library. 
No more juggling school, work, fami- 



ly, and having no personal lime. 
Maybe, I will finally, truly be free. 

April 1993 — "Not to scare you. 
but . . . ," my boss left a note on my 
desk. Attached to the note was on ar- 
ticle about the worst job market in 
many years for new graduates, I went 
to the Job Expo and found nothing 
even remotely connected to my field. 
I talk to everyone I run inio. I have 
found no prospects. I may end up 
working at a fast food place again. 

I went to the exit interview for the 
loans I have taken. 1 owe more money 
for my education than for my house! I 
start to pay in December. Six months 
sounds OK when you fill out the loan 
papers, but now, it seems awfully 
soon. 

Why should 1 be so afraid? I've 
been without a job before. I've 
worked fast food before. It is still 
scary.

You didn't 
hear it 

from me, 
but... 



by F.L. Douse 
Copy F^ltor 

You didn'i hear it from me but . . . 

Well, Senator Douse, my twin broth- 
er, answered a student's qucsLion at the 
budget meeting Monday lo the be;t of 
his knowledge. Maybe the reason that 
the student's question wasn't answered 
completely was because the chairman 
of the committee was not there, espe- 
cially at such an important meeting. 

A student wanted Dr. Borelli to 
please deliver his messages to the Stu- 
dent Senate in petsoa not via Wesicm 
Zimmerman. I meant. Western Union 
(It'sjustajokei). 

I also wanted you, Ihc readers lo 
know that I made a mistake In a 
quote that referred lo Seemab 
Rasheed as being Indian. He In- 
fonned me that he Is not. Seemab Is 
from Bangladesh. Sorry about that 

Linda. I want you to know thai I did 
not forget your request. She wanted 
mc to let you. the readers, know ihai 
our editor-in-chief. Felicia Bceching, 
was one of the u:n Extension Home- 
makers Scholarship recipients in the 
state. 

Here is my 'sip that deals with the 
faculty. Now, I ain't one to talk, but 
my source informed me that one of the 
most prestigious figures in IPFW's his- 
tory feck as if he is a carbon copy of 
Rodney Dangerfield because he gels 

Ye«, once again. Dictator Bccring 
cried on Bill Frederick's shoulder and 
complamed about the lack of respect 
shown to him at IPFW. 

Ii scans Frederick has been getting a 
lot of calls fi-om West Layaffeiie. Gen- 
eralissimo Ringel called last Friday 
and called the colonel a racist. Isn't 
that getting a liide loo much? Obvi- 
ously, Ringel needs a few lessons from 
the DCC, Hispanos Unides. and other 
minorities on campus about what true 
racism is like. Professor Frederick is 
not a racist! 

If you didn't know. well, you know 
now. There have been several changes 
made in departments on campus that 
deal with key people stepping down 
from their positions of power. 1 won- 
der who that dean or dcpanmeni head 




is and why that person has to step 
down- bad allocation of funds o: 
what? 

I would like lo commend my algebra 
teacher, Sharon Hathaway, for allow- 
ing a student to bring her child in 
class. Even when the child was mak- 
ing noise, she continued to teach the 
class as if she had not even heard the 
interruption. Another thing she docs: 
Sharon blesses students when they 
snec/c, which is a scldon-seen practice 
these days. So, if any of you have 
Sharon, give her a big hug. She's a re- 
ally great person and excellent teacher! 

For you jerks who left beer cans oui 
in the parking lot between the library 
and engineering building, you need to 
grow up. If you want to bring beer on- 
to campus in violation of the student 
code, clean up your own s — . You're 
noi at home, atrighl! Don't leave trash 
crushed on the pavement! You should 
show a bit more respect for yourself by 
not bringing your alcohol on campus 
unless you have enough to share 
with all! Thank-you! 

I think the Student Government de- 
serves a standing ovation (or all of 
their efforts on campus. For those of 
you who don't know, they are respon- 
sible for the resurfacing of the tennis 
courts (something the athletic depart- 
ment probably should have done). 
They also obtained televisions, provid- 
ing some funding and supplies for new 
and old student organizations, and paid 
the students' subscripiJon to The Com- 
municator. So. if you want lo really 
know where the majority of student 
fees need to go, it is to our Student 
Covcmmeni not the Athletic Center. 

I would also like to applaud any 
IPFW students who went down 10 
Washington to show support for the 
march in favor of lesbian, gay, and bi- 
sexual rights. We alt must remember, 
that we are in this together. So. let's 
iry to be good to one another! 

Oh. well this is the last Communica- 
tor for the year, I have no more lidtHts 
and facts to give you. However, [ will 
be back next year lo dish the dirt with 
you. as one of my favorite gossips. 
Joan Rivers, would say. Good luck on 
all your finals. And remember, you 
didn't hear it from me'

Getting summer job 
requires imagination 



By Nathan Somers 
Surr Writer 

It's ihc end o( Hie scmcsicr. which 
incaiu ihai [ have lo sum looking for 
a job again to pay for all the classes I 
railed, because I was too busy looking 
for a Job. It doesn't help that all col- 
lege courses arc weighted with 70% 
or the work at tlie end of the scmcstct. 
nor docs it help (hat I'm an unabashed 
procrasiinator who can ofTcr an em- 
ployer no tangible skills. 

When I scon the classilicd pages. I 
sec ihrcc general types of jobs of- 
fered. The most abundant opponuni- 
lies arc nursing Jobs, for which I will 
never be qualified, since 1 can't even 
watch someone else pull off a band- 
aid. Almost as numerous aic the op- 
ponunilics for people wiih such cryp- 
tic, pseudo -Indus trial skills as shunt 
driver, jig rigger, fiamdrill foreman, 
bit kibbler, nit picker, brick batter, 
and cam corder. i think they're all 
code names for types of hitmen, but I 
wouldn't be good ai that for the same 
reason 1 can't be a nurse. So with 
medical and/or organized crime em- 
ployment ruled oui, I'm left with the 
scams and cons. 

Some of the scam ads read, "Deliv- 
ery job. Payment in cash — no ques- 
tions. Ask for Smokey." Other ads 
offer good pay as an operator for one 
of those shady charity organizations 
that call people to announce that "you 
have already won a trip to Bermuda, 
but 10 claim your prize you must 
make a S30 deposit." A couple years 
ago 1 applied for this S8 an hour sales 
job. The secretary crowded me and a 
few dozen other applicants into this 
cavernous lobby which was already 
crowded with leather sofas. This 
room was large enough to have its 
own weather patterns, and with its 
thundering herds of leather sofas, it 
was sort of like visiting one of the 
Great Plains states. 

I was really intimidated by all these 
older, well dressed people JtKkeying 
for good positions on the sofas. I 
found a good spot on an extra-cush- 
iony sofa which seemed lo be grazing 
on a nearby potted fern. We were 
each handed a lengthy three page ap- 
plication. 1 remember on the last 
page it read. "This page is for inter- 
view evaluation only, Please do not 



; here," So I wrote, "Okay" Ai 
that point 1 wasn't too confident about 
gelling the Job. but I tilled the rest out 
anyhow. 

They wanted to know my previous 
work history and qualifications and 
ihc usual siud. I hate that question at 
the end of the applications when ihcy 
ask you "What other qualifications 
can you offer this company and what 
son of warm fuzzy attitudes will you 
bring to the workplace?" This is 
where they evaluate your ability to 
lie. They cupcct you to say, "I'm an 
enthusiastic, industrious, fanatically 
dcicrmincd. and enihusiastic worker 
drone, I am opposed to employee 
benefits, vacations, and child labor 
regulations — which I enthusiastically 
believe are killing American compa- 
nies' gompciiiivcness. And I'm vio- 
lently enthusiastic about working 
here," 

If you're like mc. and Ihc authorities 
haven't caught on to you yet, you 
might not like the idea of indentured 
servitude. I was sick of telling em- 
ployers what they wanted to hear, so I 
wrote, "I'm good at Jeopardy." I 
turned it in to the secretary and she 
lold mc to wait for my interview. I 
Uioughi this was unusual, since most 
places look at your application and 
then call you for an interview. After a 
while, I was called into the Chief En- 
ecuiive Suit's office. He was perus- 
ing my application, nodding, hm- 
ming. and obviously not really read- 
ing it. He was a young, sandy-haired 
guy who looked like any number of 
local newscasters. Enplaining that his 
company marketed cutlery, he added 
diat he liked my application and was 
really enthusiastic about placing me 
in the training program, [ think 1 re- 
sponded with a very businesslike 
"Huh?" 

Yes. all I had lo do was send a check 
for S99 and 1 could enter the compa- 
ny's training program. Of course. Llic 
company would enthusiastically re- 
fund the training fee if I wasn't cho- 
sen for the job. "1 may be unskilled 
but I'm not stupid," I wish I had said 
as I dipped his tic in a coffee mug. 
Instead. I left disillusioned and de- 
jected, 

I guess until I become a registered 
nurse/ trumbcl extractor. I'm stuck 
with the scams. 



Diary- 



Continued from page 2 

1 walk across campus, and see the 
signs of spring everywhere. 1 Sit in 
my car, watch robins squabbling in 
ihc trees, and squirrels bouncing 
across die lawns. It's really a pretty 
and peaceful place. 

Where have 1 ever found such a var- 
ied bunch of people? So many people 
that I've gotten to know, and I'll 
probably never see again. So many 
people, teachers, students and staff 
who have laughi me so much. So 
many people 1 will miss. 



Soon I will be free? No more class- 
es. No more geese. No more parking 
problems. And 1 find as it gels closer. 
I am less sure about it. Why was 1 in 
such a hurry? I have always been a 
little afraid of die urtknown. 

Almost May 1993 — Graduation is 
ambivalence. I have been in such a 
hurry to leave, but now I wish the se- 
mester had gone slower. This semes- 
ter went by with the speed of light. 

I am e^ciicd I am afraid. And I siill 
can't wait! Can &gt;ou?

IPSGA hammers out solutions 



By Ngozi R. Rogers 
Chief reporter 

Sludcni Senate met Monday. April 
26 and the heat was on again. TTiough 
this was the final senate meeting of 
the spring semester, the big issue was 
ihc senate's vote on the budget for 
next year. 

Jcn7 Richardson, who was presid- 
ing for Student Body President Elbcn 
Webster, asked for committee reports 
and the only report came from the 
Student Affairs commiiiee. 

The committee has been circulating 
a dorm survey and will continue to do 
so over summer break. 

Onto new business. 

The resolution 1992/93 L was 
brought to the senate concerning die 
review on the retention of Professor 
Ales Kyrou in die history dcpanmeni 
sponsored by senator Mark King. 

The students of the history depan- 
meni were lobbying for the reicniion 
of Professor Kyrou as a tenure track 
professor. Kyrou, an IPFW staff pro- 
fessor for dirce years, has a doctorate 
degree from Indiana University with 
a specialty in Eastern Europe, Bal- 
karis and Greek American history. He 
promoted courses in Eastern Euro- 
pean and Ottoman history and taught 
Byzantine history, a course thai hasn't 
been offered on any lU campus for 20 
years. 

The resolution was a recommenda- 
tion by die IPFW Student Govcm- 
"ment Association to the History dc- 
panmeni 10 reconsider their decision 
of not hiring Professor Kyrou, 

Tlie resolution passed unanimously 
widt all eight senators in favor. 

Old Business. 

The budget proposal from last week 



INSURED C/D 



was brought lo the table. However the 
budget committee chair Sccmab 
Rasheed was not in attendance for 
furdicr discussion and qucsiioTis. "I 
was not there because I had to work 
and my Job was finished," said 
Rasheed. 

There were changes made in the 
proposal by senators. For example, 
the amount for new organizations wa.s 
sliced into a fourth of the amount 
suggested. The organization m ques- 
tion was F!RE-(Fighting Ideologies 
Resistant to Equality). 

Senator Chris Douse, because of 
FIRE'S decrease told senate. "Lf you 
do that to FIRE then do die same to 
UCO (United Campus Organiza- 
tions). Do it across the board." 

Vice Chancellor for student affairs, 
Frank BorcUi was discussed also, 

Borclli, dirough die senate advisor 
Marian Zimmerman, dean of Stu- 
dents, sent word diat he wanted the 
senate to reconsider funding amounts 
for the Odyssey lecture scries and the 
smdcm handtxmk. 

The student handbook was not dis- 
cussed and one senator did not know 
what the Odyssey Lecture Scrie:; was. 

The motion lo incrca.'ic the amnuni 



to the lecture scries was mtt with 
none in favor, si* oppiiscd and tvvo 
abstinences. 

A motion to accept the resolution as 
it was at that time was pi.«cd tvViec 
but not seconded. Widiout a second, 
the motion died and the decreases 
continued. 

The budget request by Purdue-Indi- 
ana Theatre (PIT) was reduced by 
SI2.200 with six in favor, one op- 
posed and one .ibstincncc, 

TTie discussion ivas quick. 

Ttic argument was that PIT should 
raise its ticket prices and operate out 
of one building lastead of two- Kct- 
tler and the Rne Arts building. 

That was the end of the discussion, 
there were no arguments to oppose 
die cut. 

The Student Activities Board (SAB) 
was also effected with a decrease 
ofSS.-lOO. The vote was unanimous. 

SAB, one senator said, did a good 
Job but needed lo generate more 
money. 

This was disputed with, "perhaps 
their goal isn't lo make money but to 
spend it tiecausc they do activities for 
studciiLs. " mainiainal one senator.

Last Monday. Die Royal "Dons Hied 
their be:ii to ihow ihcir apptcciiHion to 
the senior athletes on the IPFW campus 
during IhcLr annual Royal Dons Awatili 
Bui quel. 

All or Die senior athletes were hon- 
ored at Ihe banquet, especially three 
ipccial individuals who were riamed 
athletes o! the year. 

Jennifer Martin, a soFlball player from 
Hobari. Indiana, was named Female 
Athlete of the Year. 

The emotional presentation was given 
by her coach of four years and good 
friend. Dale Van H out en. 

Martin is a thrcc-timc All-Great Lakes 
Valley Conference selection and o 1993 
All-GLVC candidate by lending her 
team to a 20-5 record so for this season. 

Co-athletes of the year were awarded 
for the men: Sean Gibson and Raul Pa- 
paleo claimed this honor. 

Papateo, the men's volleyball co-cap- 
lain from Cogvas. Puerto Rico, has col- 
lected an impressive list of awards dur- 
ing his past four years: second team 
All-American last season, Conference 
Player of the Year last season, several 
all -conference teams and numerous all- 

Papalco led his learn to two consecu- 
tive final appearances, 

Sean Gibson, ftom Lonevillc, Indiana. 
is IPFWs all-time leading scorer and 
reboundcr for the men's basketball 

Gibson's accomplishments for his 
four years of participation compile a 
long list of awards and honors, most re- 
cently. Great Lakes Valley Conference 
Player of the Year, third team All- 
American (basketball leams). and sec- 
ond team All-American (Division II 
Bulletin). 

At Ihc banquet, Gibson thanked his 
brother for coming to play basketball at 
IPBV. 

Shane Oibson. Scan's older broUicr, 
was awarded one more year of eligibili- 
ty earlier this week, which he had lost 
due to the failure of fulfilting a one-year 
residency requirement contained in his 
national letter of intcnL 

The additional year was granted to 
Gibson since the NCAA National Letter 
of Intent Committee found he had left 
Charleston Southern University for 
non- basketball reasons. 

Many seniors were honored at the 
Royal 'Dons Banquet lot their connibu- 
tions and dedication to IPFW and its,

I PREGNANT?! 



The 'Dons ended the season 23-7. 

Raul Papaleo. a senior said, "1 have to 
give credit to Ohio State, because they 
played tough when they had to, I don't 
know why they played so well, but they 
got the job done," 

Papaleo also said, "I had a good ca- 
reer here at IPFW and learned quite a 
bit about Volleyball." He will be look- 
ing towards Ihc Olympic Festival tiy- 
ouis next month and may be returning 
to help the team next year as an assis- 
tant coach. 

Another graduating senior, Spiegel 
said. "This loss was disappointing, con- 
sidering wc had such a good season. 
We just didn't have enough to put us 
over." 

Spiegel added, "We know wc are the 
belter team, hut wcdidn'tplay like it in 
the final, even with four people 
named to the MIVA All-Tournament

'Don plays (dual roles 



]()' Jo Ann SteinforLh 
SlafT Writer 

Nick Gchl, otherwise known 
IPPiVs mascot "Don" happened 
\x in [he righl place at 
the right lime to be 
magically uansformcd 
into the role of 
"Wayne" for the Fori 
Wayne Wizard's 
Amazing Baseball 

Gchl. a junior Gen- 
eral Studies in Riilos- 
ophy major, will hold 
dual mascot roles for 
both teams for the 
next year and a half 
until he graduates 
sometime in 1995. 

The reaction to Gchl 
as the wizard was 
overwhelming, "In fgi^, 

the Wiiiard's opener, i 
signed autographs from the sian of 
the game umil five minutes after the 
final out," said Gehl. 

Playing ihe pan of the 'Don has 



prcpuircd liim for becoming Wayne, 
Although Wa&gt;Tie is still perfecting 
his crafi, 'Don wants to come out. 
but the Wizard won't let him. "It is 
hard to shift gears." added Gehl. 

"Wayne is slill 
trying lo gel used to 
the costume and the 
slower paced tempo 
of baseball, but will 
occasionally throw 
whammies at the op- 
posing team." Gchl 
claboraicd. 

if this is not chal- 
lenging enough for 
Gchl, on Wednesday 
he played both Don 
and Wayne on April 
28. IPFW played 
Huntingion at Memo- 
rial Stadium at 3:00 
p.m. Later the same 
Gehl ^^y' Wayne appeared 

when the Wizards 
played Burlington at 7:00 p,m. 

Gchl will retire as the 'Don niM 
year at ihc conclusion of the Final 
Four men's volleyball season.

Of all the terms discussed today con- 
cerning ihe conliaccption wars, ihe one 
nol mentioned quite as often is the 
emergency contnicepiion. The fact thai 
it. ihc 'morning after' pill, is nol dis- 
cussed is one thing. The fact that it is 
legal and also being distributed to siu- 
dcnis at Indiana University in Bloom- 
ington is another. 

The 'morning after' pill, also called en 
'emergency contraceptive,' is available 
to lU students within 72 hours after tin- 
proleclcd or faulty coniraceptive inter- 
course through lU's Student Health 
Center, 

The importance of this information is 
that it. like other options to women, arc 
nut publicized. 

Women should be informed of oil 
their options in order to make informed 
decisions that will effect their lives. 

The Director of Health and Wellness 

Adams Revie\A{ed 

ByJoAnnSlclnforlh 
Slaff Writer 

Stephen Perfcci, IPBV Professor of Pho- 
tography, introduced Sarah Adams to a 
near cajwciiy crowd at Ncff Hall on Tues- 
day April 20 at 7:30 p.m. 

Adam's lecture and slide show "The 
American Earih: The Phoiogtnphy of 
Ansel Adams," provided the audience a 
close up chronological view of the anisis 
work spanning over fifty years. 

Ansel Adams began his career taking 
pictures of Yoscmiic National Park in Cali- 
fornia. She described his work as a visual 
diary. Known as an environmentalist who 
drove a Cadillac, ale beef and consumed 
large amounts of iiijuor, Adams bcciunc a 
member of the Siena Club and was ap- 
pointed ihc first Sierra Club photographer 
and served on the board of dinicrors from 
1933 to the 1960s, 

After the 30s, Adam's style transformed 
in the images that he is famous for today. 
He discovered the power of the light fomi 
and was known to wait hours for the right 
light. 

By the time his Moonlight over Hernan- 
dez (New Mc.iico) was cicatcd iti ihc 70's. 
he was paid a record S71,000 for a phoio- 
grBphoflhat time. 

Sarah Adams eiiplaincd his view as "all 
that is needed to cupcnencc the emotional 
event is the photograph and ihc viewer."

Education at lU's student health 
Ann Reese agrees. "lThe| more people 
that know, [about the 'morning after' 
pilll the more likely the information 
will teach a person who is in an emer- 
gency situation." 

Becsc commented that the 'morning 
after' pill has been available at lU's 
campus for the 10 years that she has 
been employed at lU. 

Yet she admits dial many students still 
don't know it is available. 

"If you ask a lot of people here, 
they've never heard of emergency con- 
iraccplion either." Reese said, "We've 
got lo gel the word out." 

Gelling the word out is important to 
all sides of the issue considering that 
the 'morning aficr' pill is on the line t&gt;c- 
twecn conlraceplion and abortion. 

Il is considered a contraceptive be- 
cause ii prevents the fcnili/ed egg from 
being attached to the uterus wall; it is 
actually a high dose of hormones and 



several birth control pills. 

Some arc concerned that ii will be 
used as an abortion allemative. 

Planned Parcnthood's Director of Pa- 
tient Services. Marilyn McConncIl ex- 
plains. "To give the pills requires a 
pregnancy test and a physical exam to 
be Sim: the (patient] is not pregnant." 

The 'morning after' pill is prescribable 
by physicians but many physicians ei- 
ther don't know, won't prcicibc Ihcm or 
worse won't icll patients about the op- 



Women's Studies director. Jcanctu 
Clausen was glad to hear that the 
'morning after' pill was available ai !U, 
She pondered. "I wonder aboul Ihe sin- 
cerity of those who "shy away' from 
prescribing the pill for this purpose 
(emergency conlraceplion] because it 
'dredges up the murky issue of when 
contraception ends and abortion be- 
gins'. You've probably noticed that the 
'murky issues' tend to be less worri- 
some when there's a lot of money to be
