The first question. In two parts, 
WD3 directed al Senate members 
and asked why no special elcellon

Al that point, Jeff Sandy, speaking 
for the concerned students, said, 
"There Is a question whether people

In response, Schcnk said Sandy 
was con'ect that C4ily e small

that such activities were necessary

"I don't want lopay an actlvily fee

question, Maeckcr said "The special 
election simply docs not apply lathis

Senate conslitulion referred to by 
those who deem the election 
necessary Is "a mailer o( In- 
terpretation." 

The special election m question 
was called [or by Sandy, then Senate 
parliamentarian, in a decision last 
spring. Sandy said because the 
Students' Government general

because no rules exist in Ihe con- 
slilution for Ihe special election and 
therefore could not be held until 
eight weeks alter being called by 
Schenk. 

He said ihc Senate and SUBOG 
could not conduct Students'

election we re called. 

Sandy disputed Ihis claim saying 
there were sllpulalions in his April

The agent of change In Ihis revolution 
Is an army of "knowledge workers" —

professionals ranging Irom computer 
experts lo personnel administrators. 
Not only ore such workers new' on Ihc

'Watchdog agency' studies tax 



By CAROLYN ROGERS WILBER 

Staff Writer 
Local taxpayers can be better in- 
formed about how iheir tax dollars are 
teing spent by Ihe clly, Ihc counly, 
lownshijfi, and school districts. ' 



The To X payer's Research 
Association, a "watchdog agency" 
founded in 1934 for local government 
budgets, is concerned with the clflcicnl 
use of the local lax dollar This service 
IS a nonprofit corporation governed by 
a t-&gt;ard ol director? and run by R. Dean 
Hall, executive vicc-presldenl of the 
association, and his staff of one full- 
time and one part-lime employee from 
an otRce on Ihe Oiird floor of Ihe 
Chamtier of Commerce building, B26 
Ewing Street. 

The actual studies of local budgets 
arc done by volunteer commit lees

While the State Legislature is In

part of Hall's viork for the service. 
During legislative sessions. Hall said, 
bulletins go out almost weekly to 
members, keeping them abreast of 
developments and issues which would

White^rollar workers, a majority of 
whom ore college graduates, have also 
proliferated Since 1960, white-collar 
ranks have Increased 72 pcrccnl. irom 
28,5 million lo -19 million. By conlrnsl, 
blufrcoliar workers — once a majorily 
IQ labor's ranks — Increased only 30 
percent, from 2-1 million to 31.2 million. 
Spearheading Ihis invasion of 
knowledge workers Is whal the census 
calls "professional and technical" 
w-orters. whose numbers more than 
doubled between 1960 and 1960. Such 
groups as computer specialists, ac- 
counlanls, personnel admimslrators, 
quality conlnri experts, and social 
scicnlisUlcdtheadvancc. 
CHANGING TtlE NA-a^KE OF WORK 
The real slory. however. Is nol m 
their numbers but in the qualilalive 
impact ol knowledge woiicers on 
working conditions. First, they ore 
raliona tiling more of the work of the 
corporalioti and public agency; Ihey 



gather facts, onalyic data, and reason 
lo an extent unknown to mosl of their 
predectBsors. According lo Alan C. 
Nixon, former president of the 
American Chemical Society, aboul half 
ol the U,S, labor force is involved in 
creating, manipulating, or using in- 
formation, or working wilh 
technologies based on data 

Second, knowledge workers exploit 
new technologies. 11 is a neat trick to 
invent a more powerful computer or a 
more sophisticated drilling rig. but it Is 
an e\en neater trick (as scares of other 
countries that have failed in this 
respect know loo well) to educate and 
Ira In employees lo make full use of that 
computer or rig. 

Inlcrmsof the quality ot work life — 
especially the sense of cxdlemenl and 
reward one gains during working hours 
— knowledge workers have had a still 
more significant infiuence. II is 
because of them, more than any other 
employee group, that thousands of 
companies and agencies have 
liberallied decision-making, taking 
many day-tonlay decisions out of Ihe 
hani^ ol a few- leaders and distributing 
respDosibilily among Irained em- 
ployees down Ihe line. 

Using slalistical analysis, a factory 
manager decides on his awn, instead of 
asking the chief executi\'e. whether to 
shut down the A line and add an extra 
shin on the B line Again, the promotion 
manager ol a retail store oflen decides 
on her own. instead ol asking the 
president, what specials lo advertise. 
EXTENSION OF IIUH^N RIGHTS 

But the most lar-reoclnng influence 
of all will be the demand of 
professional, lectmical. and other 
knowledge workers for more human 
rights, especially dvil liberties, 
Tliroughoul their education, these men 



ond women have been trained, as pari 
of Ihcir lechnical approach, lo value 
such Ihings as freedom of inquiry and 
Ihepowerolevidence. 

ProfQsionals and technicians see no 
reason why they should nol be allowed 
lo speak out against an action of the 
organization thai seems illegal or 
unethical to them, or why Ihey should 
have lo carry oul a boss's directive that 
violates their norms of fair play. They 
see no reason why they should not 
engage in ofl-hours acbvilies ol tbdr 
choice, so long as the aclivilies don't 
conflict with the employer's interest 

They sec no reason why Iheur privacy 
should be invaded by polygraphs, 
psychological tests, or electronic 
Eurvelllancc. nor any reason why their 
personnel files should be kept secret 
from Ihcm. And they see no reason why 
confiicls With their supervisors should 
be arbitrated by biased superiors ; they 
want fair hearuigs by neutral In- 

Wtat IS especially galliiig to them is 
Ihal many employers object lo their 
pressure for greater civil liberties 
while disregarding incompetence In 
order lo avoid unpleasant discharge 
procedures

After refusing an opportunity to 
resign. Jeff Sandy, Sludcnt Senate 
parliamentarian, was recalled by Ken 
Schenk. sludcnt body president, al the 
Senate's Oct. 14 meeting 

The recall came in response to 
charges made by the Inlcrtml Affairs 
Commillee. which were read by Holden 
Maeeker. committee chairman 

"The parliamentanan mkssed three 
Senate meetings," Maeckcr said Bui 
Maeeker later admitted that theSenale 
constitution allowed a member to miss 
five meetings and therefore, "Thai 
chareeisopcntorcinlcrprelallon " 

Dereliction of duty was another 
charge leveled at Sandy. "When 
handling an appeal ion the con- 
stitutionality of a piece of leglslalloni. 
the parliamentarian must ask the 
student body president to nominate four 
provisional court Justices to assist In 
ruling on the appeal. On Sept. 30, Sandy 
failed to do this," Maeeker said. 

All the charges were contained In a 
document signed by Maeeker and Suzy 
Scare, former cOH;hairpcr50n of the 
committee, who has since resigned 
fromtheScnate 

After lengthy and strident debate, 
during which senators Mark Smedal 
and Don Moore spoke in Sandy's 
defense, saying that he was not given 
the opporiunily lo answer Ihe charges 
prior to his recall. Schenk announced 
his recall of Sandy and appointed EUIen 
Engteman, student bod&gt;' vice- 
president, acting parliamentarian 

Earlier in the meeting Engtemanhad 
called for senator Bruce Clark's 
resignation in a disagreement con- 
cerning tapes which Clark had made ol 
Senate meetings "No official tape was 
made for the last meeting because of a 
proUem with the Stnate's tape 
recorder," Engleman said. "Senator 
Clark made a tape on his own recorder 
w-hich he has refused to turn over to the 
Senate clerk ( then Ron Diehl i so thai 
we could have the minutes of that 
meeting. 



"He has seen fit to turn the tape aver 
to The Communicator, bul he has 
refused to honor Ihe request ol the 
secretary of Students' Government 
lEnglemanl," hesaid. « 

Engleman also charged that Gark 
Illegally taped a seclion of a closed 
session on Sept 30 and has several 
times reficed Engleman's requests lo 
erase that portion of the tape In her 

"It is my opinion that he has no 
respect for his position as a senator, 
and, therefore, no respect lor the 
Senate," Engleman said. 



Gark refused lo resign. 

In other business: 

—Internal Affairs announced that 
there are three lelt-handed desks In 
every room in Building D 

—The senate allocated tlia for two 
poster boards lo lisl classified ads and 
information envelopes. Ron Diehl, 
sponsor of the "Swap and Shop" bill, 
called it "The university's own Ped- 
dlers' PoiL" 

—A newsletter will be started to 
inform students of Students' Govern- 
ment happenings

The Bame being played wilh parking

In ihc shell game, a small objecl Uike

Alter a sucker. ..cr... a,, .player makes 
a bet on his or her uhllily (o find the halt

switches around Ihe shells, attempting 
1(1 fool Ihe player 

The player then chooaea a shell 
lusually Ihc choice is wrong and the 
gamespcrson wins), the gamespcrson 
chides Ihe player (or not t)eing 'with the 
game' and goes on about business 
preparing for the next game and its next 
suckers.,. er.., play era. 

In tile parking lot game, likewise, the 
edmlnlslration is Uiking a small object 
(a compus parking space) and switching 
It back and forlh beneath various "A," 
"B," "V," and "Handicapped Only" 
signs. 

HIdccn In all this Is Ihe fact that 
switching signs over existing spaces 
docs not create more parking spaces for 
anyone, 

CerUilnly the s^&lt;ilches will make 
parking more convenient for "A" and 
"Ilnndlcopped Only" space users, a 
move we believe to be Justified since the 
"A" people have paid extra money for 
(he privilege oF parking near campus 
buildings and the handicapped who use 
the campus need easier access than the 
non-handicapped. 

However, the holders "B" parking 
permits have made (heir bels,„er...paid 
their fees for the chance (o play the 
garncer ..hunt for parking spaces, and 
unlike Uie players ol Ihe shell game al 



lis, these people expect to 
win., er. find a parking space 

The players of Ihe parking game know 
the game well and are not easily fooled 
They know that when only 2,B00 parking 
spaces exist on campus and 8,300 people 
have permits Ihe odds are not in their 

While we've been told that FREE 
spaces exist nearby— only about one-half 
mile from KelUer Hall-we know that 
we have paid a fee for the right to park in 
a "B" designated parking lot 

We expect to find a space in which lo 
park for our money. 

We'll not be content until the odds of 
our finding a parking space are in- 
creased and the number of available 
spaces more nearly equal the number of 
people who have paid for the right lo use 

The administration has said they are 
studying the parking situation. The 
projected enrollmani for future 
semesters Is being studied, and the need 
for additional parking lots will be 
delermined from that study. 

While we do not advocate needless 
cementing of green, grassy areas 
around campus, we do advocate 
reasonable assumptions about Ihe 
continued need for more parking spaces. 

We believe that Ihc great disparity 
between the number of people wanting to 
park and the available spaces is reason 
enough to create additional parking lots. 

We want lo know what is being done to 
increase our odds of finding a parking 

We don't want lo be Ihe "suckers" in

Then came Ihe league

against Ihe ever-popular 
Yankees and those menln- 
blue I&gt;odgers against the

In fact, it was the rtodgers-

The parcnls of &lt; 
million children under IB 
dlvorco each year, according 
lo Dr David Young, clinical 
psychologist and associate 
professor ol psychology al 
IPFW, 

In many coses, the 
children of the divorcing 
parents have not been 
[MTlparcd for the divorce. 
Parents often won't discuss

problems, Young said. 

Voune Is currently doing 
research on IhocffecUveiiMS 
o( Iho divorce workshops 
thai hove been BCl up by the 
Family Relations Division of 
the Superior Court of Allen 

Over the last three years. 
Ihe Superior Court has 
required the pareni who filed 
for divorce to attend a four* 
hour divorce experience 
workshop Because of the 
success of the adult 
workshops, the pro}ccl 
directors established Iwo 
more workshops lor children 
ol divorcing parcnls, Young 

One workshop is for 
&gt;ounger children (seven lo 
11 years old) and one Is fcT 
adolescents (12 lo 17 years 
oldl. The workshops arc 
designed to help divorcing 
parents and their children 
understand and cope wilh 
the problems they face 
because of the divorce. 

Young explained that even 
fairly young children need tu 
discuss the divorce, either 
with their parents or with a 
counselor, "Parents need to 
reallie that even K the 
children aren't told about the 
divorce they'll know." he 
sold. "If they don'l know the 
righl iuformBtlon, they'll 

Parents who ha\e a hard 



ing aboul ihe 
n find that, their 
children don'l adjust i-ery 
well. Voung finds thai so 
percent of the children 
blame themselves for their 
parents' divorce to some 
degree. 

Through questionnaires 
given lo Ihe children before 
Ihc worhshop. Young also 
discovered that children who 
blomed both parents or jual 
their mother anilclpaled a 
more difricull period of seU- 
adjustmenl, while those who 
blamed ncllher pareni or 
only iheir father anticlpfltcd 
a leas di in cult adjustment 

The inlerprelallon of Ihese 
findings is not quite dear. 
"Most of the children who 
allcndi^ Ihe ivorkshop were 
living with their mother," 
Young said, "and perhaps 
those who blamed Mother 
were less secure about the 
safely of Iheir home base." 
This could be Ihc reason Ihat 
children who blamed their 
mother anilclpaled having a 
harder time adjusting to Ihe 



Just when you thought II

from Maurice Shady, IPFW 
chief of Safely and Security, 
about parking space 

Lol It, between Nelf Hall 
and Building D, will have 
three east-side handicapped 
spaces combined into one, 
and gain eight new hand-

All of this is in effect right 
now. Dccording lo Shady. In 
coming weeks the north side

Lial Monday niglil at Uie Coliseum, an event took place 

Ihai marked ibt beginning of a Hcraier ritual — muscubr

Thf crwwd roared u.hen one team was able lo put the ball

making craiy geslures at players, ofriciala, and fans.

haihetball-ilylc at Ihc Kanus Cily Kings defeated the 
Indiana Pacers 111-109 In a pre-scason eihlbttlon game, 
fcalurtnganoppearaneel^the"SanDiegoChicken " 

The game, ns a whole, was less exciting than a high school 
secllonal. Bui, afler all, what can one cipect from a pe 
season mhilnllon where mllllon-doMar athletes are sirel 
chlng thpir musclta and coaches are trying 10 trim their 
foitcrs by seeing which rookies Ihcy can cut? 

Even so, why would people pay oa much as Ht.SO for 
game Ihal had no bearing whatsoever on which leam makes 
thePJUA playoffs nentApriP Many could not find a reason lo 
come, and did not, bul the 1.705 who did found plenty of 
reasons lo spend a Monday night watching Iwo leams run and 
dunk. 

Some JurI wanted to sec n professional basketball gamo, 
since very few NBA gomes arc played In non-PJBA- 
fronehised Fori Wayne. The last NBA game played In Fort 
Wayne was InSeptembcr, 1960. 

(Mhcra wanted to uc former ii; starting guard Bulch 
Carter make his debut ina Pacer luilform. The Bobby Knlghl 
disciple scored eight paints as the partisan crowd cheered for 
him more tluin for any other player 

Sllllolherj came to sec such long-lime NBA standouts as 
George McGinnl.s, nnolhcr former lU player who scored 
seven points; Billy Knlghl. who scored IZ points; or Phil 
Ford, a former University o( North Carolina All-Amertcan 
who scored ID. 

ir the rest were bored by Ihc game, however, Ihcy were not 
bored by Ihe "San Diego Chicken." This human-drcssedin- 
feathers pulled several antics: He posed for several 
phalographors just like Cheryl Ticgs once posed for Sports 
Illustrated, he punched out a mannequin dressed like a

The Tuskers' Oct. 17 win, 
along wilh their 2-1 win over 
Bethal Oct. is. upped Ihelr 
record to B+1. 

Oulshooting Marion Z6-2 
tor the game, the Tuskers' 
goal came when Mtaden 
KralJ received a pass a few 
feet in front of the goal. 
Sharpe came up from behind 
Kralj, who Ihen passed the 
ball over lo Sharpe. bhorpe

Afterwards, C!Oach Ed 
Slefankiewncz cited the 
defense for their bnllient 
play. Ho was especially 
pleased with junior fullback 




much at the beginning of Ihc 
year." Slefankiewici said, 
"but he's been starling since 
about mid-season and he's 
really done the job," 

Throughout the afternoon, 
luUbacks Mark Gabrek, 
Dave Husar and Dwire 
battled up Marlon's attack 
and forced the play in 
Marion's end. 

With Saturday's win, 
Stcfanktewicz believes the 
TUskcrs will receive a 
playolf berth In the NAIA 
playoffs. The team is 
currently ranked third in its 
district, and the coach ex- 
plained that the top six 
teams In the districl will 
make Ihe playoffs. 

CWt 15, the Tuskers got 
two quick goals from Sharpe 
and Tony Davis, and then 
held off Bethal to drop them 
from Ihe numtwr three spol 
In the rankings "We came 



iHiI ilrong. In Lhefirsl liienlv 
minules," Slelankiewici 
satd. ■■Tlien we played great 
defense lo win the game." 

Though the TUskers were 
only able 10 tally one goal 
Saturday, they completely 
dominated the game. Were II 
not for some brilliant 
goal tending by the Marion 
goalie, Ihe score could have 
been Hveor six to nothing. 

In Ihc first half, Krai] was 
Iwicc stopped on point-blank 
shots by the Marion goalie. 
The Tuskers also seemed to 
try to get too fancy wilh the 
tiall; on few rushes 
downfleld. Tusker forwards 
made one too many passes, 
thus allowing Ihe Motion 
defense lo recover and 
break-up Ihc play. 

The Tuskers' season so far 
has been like a roller-coaster 
ride, ihey opened the season 
with four high scoring wins 
before meeting Indiana 



itraight. They seemed to 
bead back on the winning 
path when Ihey downed Trl- 
Statc, but tost lo North Park 
College, their next game. 

Following North Park, 
they were behind 3-0 at 
halltimc lo St. Fronds, Tlic 
Tuskers took Ihe gome from 
St. Francis, and won 4-3 in 



Slefanklewid believes the 
St Francis game was the 
turning point. "We were 
down that game," he said. 
"We proved to ourselves that 
we could come back. It has 
built up oiu- confidence."

The team was mentally in

the start, as hesitancy many 
times was the dilferencc 
belwecn getting the job done 
and lositig possession of the 

ITommenling en the night's

consistency out there,, .They 
just didn't have their heads 
m the game." Tliis has been 
a stumbling block ol the 
team all season. 

"When we needed a big 
play we didn't get it," he 
continued. Sophomore Sue 
Hendricks, realiiing that the 

sistency, added. "We play 
well, bul then let up. We 
have lo want lo win allot the

Hendhcks, one of the 



portanl factor liccause most 
of the women on this year's
