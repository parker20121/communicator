ALSO approval precipitates 
conspiracy allegations 



A source who spoke lo The 
Communicator only on condition of 
anonymity alleged that several IPSGA 
senators recently conspired to block 
senate approval of the ALSO constitu- 
tion "on tbe basis of homophobia and 

ALSO is a new IPFW student orga- 
nization that supports and promotes 
gay and lesbian lifestyles. 

"A member of the Campus 
Organizations Committee suggested 
that the Committee inform the Senate 
that they were unable lo properly 
review ALSO's constitution, and that 
they try lo bury it for at least the 
remainder of the summer sessions," 
the source alleged. 

Another source close lo IPSGA 
confirmed the story and further 
alleged. "They said that they wanted to 
bury the ALSO eo million because 
Indiana is a conservative slate and 
IPFW is a conservative campus-thai 
the students wouldn't wont a gay and 
lesbian organization on campus." 

The second source also commented 
on ihe timing of the alleged conspira- 
cy, 'Two members decided they could 
block ALSO now since the Senate had 
just reconvened and some of the mem- 



IPSGA President Mark King com- 
mented, 'I'm 1o1aJ.lv appalled that any- 
one in this government would violate 
their own constitution — but if these 
allegations are true, it surely docs." 

King said if the allegations prove 
true, he will recommend appropriate 
action be taken by the Vice President 
of Legislation and/or Infernal Affairs. 

IPSGA Senator Chris Douse slated, 
"There should be a full inquiry. If the 
allegations ore true, what other organi- 
zations arc being or could be blocked? 
"People who would do something ILkt 
that are not the kind of people whe 
should be part of Sludcn 
Govemmenl." Douse added. 

IPSGA Senator and former Vict 
President of Legislation Jerr) 
Richardson said. "I think the Campus 
Organization Committee wank 
review the ALSO constitutio 
ensure that it met IPSGA require- 
ments. I think they would have 'con- 
spired lo block' any organization's 
constitution for that legitimate reason.' 

Richardson also staled that the stu 
dent government supports the start of .

ihe field of poetry 

Crisler. on IPFW English major, was 
awarded a national and prestigious 
honor by the United Stales

Crisler's advisers, Tim Lake and 
Paulina Salvador, recommended him 
for ihe award. 

According to Salvador, less than 
10% of all American college students 
receive this prestigious award. 

Crisler will be featured in the United 
Stales Achievement Academy Official 
Collegiate Yearbook, lo be published in 

"I was surprised that Paulina recom- 
mended me, but even more surprised 
that I won." said Crisler. 

According lo Salvador, criteria for 
selection of this award is academic per- 
formance, interest and aptitude, leader- 
ship qualities, responsibility, enthusi- 
asm, motivation lo learn and improve, 
citizenship, attitude and cooperative 
spirit and dependability. Cnsler met the 
standards of selection established by the 
academy-

before in America's history," said 
George Stevens. Executive Director of 
tbe United Stales Achievement

portive to the school, in particular to ihe 
Multicultural Services office.

program, be was always willing lo offer 
his assistance." 

Crisler. whose main interest is poet- 
ry, had a book of poems published in

sible for getting him interested in poet- 
ry 

He describes his slyle as ""poetry and 
prose, combined with narrative."

Working for tbe Mastering the 
Possibilities program, he goes into 
junior and senior high school classes 
and gives them advice and encourage- 
ment on post- secondary education. 

He is also involved in mentoring

for fun he enjoys participating in a con- 
temporary gospel singing group "Music

Faculty Forum 

Instructors owe students each 
week 'bought-and-paid-for,' 
professor says 



By Richard Ramsey 
AuocUl* Professor or English 

In addition to enjoying luch topical 
rights u freedom from race or gender 
peneculion, students ate naturally 
entitled to expect that instructors will 
observe long-standing, reasonable, and 
widely practiced administrative proce- 
dures, even when those procedures are 
not ipcllcd out in published IPFW pol- 
icy. Unfortunately, some instructors 
ire not above ignoring print as well as 
history in suit their own convenience, 
offering the flimsy justification thai 
students are only too happy to accept, 
for example, scheduling "occommoda- 

Such policy distortions are loo 
commonly associated with the end of a 
term and the administration of final 
examinations. Few people, students or 
instructor*, relish finals, but many take 
them seriously. Final examinations do 
influence final grades and Ihey can 
stimulate worthwhile review and syn- 
Ifaeiii, 

Recognizing the practical and theo- 
retical importance of finals, IPFW has 
seconded common sense with a writ- 
ten policy, widely available and 
enshrined in local history. That policy 
has long recognized that Final exami- 
nations arc not equally suitable to all 
subjects. 

li provides for a sixteen-week 
semester during the last week of which 
classes meet for a single (wo-hour 
period, but it does not mandate a final 
examination. If a final is pcdagogicoly. 
advisable, the instructor is responsible 
for tailoring it to this period. 1/ a final 
is not appropriate, the instructor is 
responsible for conducting a regular 
clogs, 

"Responsible"' is the operative 
word Nobody expects end -of- the -term 
activities to be particularly uniform. 
For example, a final meeting may be a 
course review or a pass -back -and -dis- 
cus session based on term papers 

detailed tests of cumulative recall to 
impromptu essays 

Responsible alternatives abound, 
bul the point is that many students 
expect to be called on for some sort of 
serious performance. Based. I suppose, 
on this view of the sixteenth week as a 
relatively important one in the acade- 
mic calendar, IPFW has historically 
banned major tests in Ibe fifteenth, 
penultimate week of the term, the idea 
being thai students would use the (rel- 



ative) respite to review for loose class- 
es in which final examinations would 
influence, perhaps fatefully, their 
grades 

This attitude toward the nature and 
pace of the semester has long seemed 
reasonable. So reasonable, in fact, thai 
not long ago the Senate, apparently 
operating on the model of our 
Bloomingion branch, officially afford- 
ed instructors the option of scheduling 
the fifteenth week as a review period, 
free of regular class meeting. 

Some instructors prefer to continue 
on IPFW's old model, also used by the 
West Lafayette branch, bul others 
bave round this new option an 
improvcmcnl. A few even schedule 
review sessions on demand during the 
fifteenth week, or provide additional 
office hours instead of simply leaving 
students lime lo review their lexis and 
notes. 

Consider, however, the long histo- 
ry of abuse accumulated by term-end 
activities even before this week of 
review was made available. Some 
instructors have almost routinely taken 
advantage of the altered sixteenth- 
week schedule (one two-bour meeting 
replacing two or three meetings, or 
one longer meeting) by simply cancel- 
ing the final class or by treating it as a 
non-academic period. 

Such cavalier dismissal of a week 
of bought-and-paid-for education is 
unconscionable enough, bul some 



o -opted into thinking they're gelling 
i break, that less is more, bul it stinks 
vhen il intrudes inconvenience on 
crious students trying to work to the 
cquircments of instructors who

offending against bolh history and 
innovation by scheduling important 
examinations in the fifteenth week, 
defying policy lo be sure, bul also 
usurping lime other instructors have 
set aside for review. 

Nor is it unknown for instructors lo 
go even further, conducting a last, sub- 
stantial examination in the fourteenth 
week while olso canceling classes dur- 
ing Ihe fifteenth week and scheduling 
some trivial octivity, which they prob- 
ably hope no one will attend, for Ihe 
two now-meaningless hours reserved 
for them during the sixieenlh week. 

How are such frauds perpetrated on 
students who have paid a full semes- 
ter's luition? The inslructor blandly 
announces the course calendar- 
maybe ai Ihe beginning of the semes- 
ter, or maybe as a "modification" 
much lalcr— and says he or she is sure 
no one will object to the arrangement, 
which may or may not be presented as 
'"special." This low-caliber connivance 
is smelly, of course, when students ore 



Those sbori-cbanged students ore 
faced with preparing for a final test in 
one course while completing work, 
perhaps including term papers, for 
oihcr courses. Instructors who bave 
structured their courses expecting stu- 
dents to spend lime pulling the semes- 
ter together arc also frustrated. 

The question is what you can do if 
one of your instructors offers you such 
an "opportunity," one you feel you 
can't refuse because of orchestrated 
peer pressure or because the instructor 
will lower your grade if you don't go 
along. 

The firs! hard answer is thai you 
must react immediately; you must say, 
interrupting if necessary, that Ibe new 
(illicit) calendar is likely to be a bur- 
den lo you. And you should not accept 
"exceptional" status in response, some 
special provision made for you 
because you won'l go along with the 
majority. (Of, course it's unthinkable 
that ony instructor, even one unscrupu- 
lous enough to try to get an extra week 
or two off him- or herself, would actu- 
ally hear any malice loward you for 
such recalcitrance.) 

The second hard answer is Ibat you 
should go to the instructor's chairper- 
son — in which case you should go lo a 
dean, either the instructor's or your 
own. (If you happen lo have an advi- 
sor you think can help you, he or she 
might be a good source of advice.) 

I like to think thai if you raise the 
issue your inslructor will respond by 
making arrangements to respect poli- 
cy, which in this case reflects bolh 
your interests and the university's 
expectations. 1 also like lo think thai 
chairpersons and deans know what to 



doit 









Ultimately, bo* 
protect you from such self-serving 
manipulation but yourself Ask about 
the calendar on the first day of class, 
and if the answers don'l square with 
what's published in the schedule of 
classes, be prepared to drop the course 
or change sections while you can get 
all your money back. Don't let one 
instructor's convenience compromise 
your grade in courses whose schedules 
rcspccl history as well as policy. ♦

True commitment to diversity needed at IPFW campus 



Tbe concept of diversity is ricochet- 
ing off the walls of nearly every 
American institutional structure— big 
business, multi-media, government, 
schools and churches 

Diversity is nothing new— only the 
rhetoric surrounding diversity is new. 
Until recently, diversity in American 
institutions has been closeted Diverse 
groups of people have not appeared 
suddenly or miraculously Yet, it is 
only lately thai Americans have begun 
to "communicate diversity." lo include 
the historically excluded and lo extol 
tbe virtue of difference 

In the interest of participating in this 
"new" community that celebrates dif- 
ference, tbe editorial board of The 
Communicator has madf, and will con- 
tinue to make, diversity a matter of pol- 
icy. 

The board is committed lo present- 
ing tbe news that affects all factions of 
tbe IPFW student body. That is not lo 
say that the board selects information 
thai appeals lo "the average IPFW stu- 



dent;" thji ls to the urban, white. Mid- 
western. middle-ela»i. belcroseiua]. 
adult college student- Tbe board's goal 
is noi to spoon-feed some watered- 
down version of the campus news lo an 
amorphous mass tagged "the average 
IPFW student;" rather. Ibe goal is lo 
communicate diverse information to a 
diverse body of students. The board is 
dedicated lo facilitating communication 
across j unique group of individuals 

Furthermore, tbe board intends, as 
in the past, lo give voice to ihe entire 
IPFW community The Communicator 
is committed lo giving faculty, staff, 
administrators and students an opportu- 
nity to enter into dialogue with one 
another through their student newspa- 
per. 

Il is easy, however, to spcaV the lan- 
guage of diversity. Il is much more dif-

Lyrics need second glance 



By Ramona Mcgown 
Managing Editor 

Do me baby, and let me lick you up and 
down, bumps and pump, pour some 
sugar on me. 

Sound familiar? 

If not. ihesc ore the titles of the sin- 
gles thai are currently somewhat popu- 
lar on the R&amp;B and Rock charts 

I will be Ibe first to admit that these 
singles ore some of my favorites, bul I 
also will admit ibat I am somewhat 
embarrassed by the lyrics and videos 
that the artists choose to come up with. 

They are not only explicit, bul I 
often found myself wondering whether 
or not I was watching a Cinema* show 

In all honesly, most college students 
do nol have a problem with the content 
shown on Ihe video lapes and CD's. 
Yet, I would bel ibat most students 
would not like their future nieces and 
nephews or sons and daughters lo view 
such material, 

Is this all lhat my generation can 



sing and dance about? Everyone likes 
entertainment, but where do we draw 
the line? 

Writers of explicit lyrics (Dure I 
sound like Tipper Gore? Ugh!) need to 
lake a second look in which direction 
our generation is going. 

When will my generation lake Ihe 
time to pull our heads out of our asses. 
and start taking steps towards making a 
difference in society? 

Many generations have used music 
to address social concerns white enter- 
taining their fans as well. 

Some would say lhat Snoop Doggy 
Dog is expressing ihe harsh realities of 
life in the ghetto, bul I would say those 
persons enduring hardships during the 
civil rights movement experienced 
harsher realities. 

Degrading women in videos has 
nothing to do with a struggle. 

Mosl of the artists are not creating 
new music, jusl copying old music, 
while changing the lyrics to include 
graphic descriptions of certain body 
pans and what should be done with

The editorial board of Tbe

tors must learn tolerance, after all. 
IPFW community members have a 
common goal: to give and lo gel the 
best education possible. 

Difference docs not have to be divi- 
sive, but il dues have lo be acknowl- 
edged and deall with in a positive, 
proactive manner if IPFW expects to 
continue to grow and change ♦ 



Ihem. 

I am nol in favor of censorship, bul, 
in ihe same vein showing people grop- 
ing and grinding in their underwear is a 
bit much. 

II seems almost as though nothing is 
left lo Ihe imagination of the audience. 

Most young artists' lyrics have no 
social value whatsoever. It's whatever 
sells 

"An albino, a mosquito, my libido," 
Ihesc ore Ibe lyrics by Ihe alternative 
group Nirvana. What does Ihis mean? 
Most fans could not tell you, cither. 

In no way am I saying artists never 
write meaningful lyrics, bul mosl of Ihe 
music of my generation is copied from 
other artists. 

It appears Ibat we have become a 
commercialized group of young people 
who take what has been written from 
ihe past and. in most cases, use and 
abuse material. 

I do believe without a doubt lhat my 
generation is filled with a generous 
amount of talent thai has yel lo be dis-

A soldier's story 

by Perry Monroe 

Getting a hand on handed-ness 



You know, it's been a mystery since 
lime immemorial: why we are left- or 
right-banded? We have come lo believe 
that left- or right-handed orientation has 
a deeper meaning; in fact, we often 
assign our orientation a meaning that 
borders on the divine. Our onenlalion 
even mokes for debate among scholars 

The experts say left-handed individ- 
uals bave higher IQ's lhan right-ban- 

More males are left-handed than 
females, but females have higher IQ's 
lhan us males (what we guys don'l bave 
in quality we make up in quantity). We 
left-handed people are such a minority 
we only notice that most noble of traits: 
tbe art of using our left hands to com- 
mand Ihe necessities of life I've been 
lold we even go lo an early grave 
because everything is geared for those 
right-handed people-it's all thai stress. 
you know. 

Tbe Establishment refers lo left-or 
right-handed "dominance "(like it's not 
torture enough just learning how to 
write). My commanding officer's wife 
teaches kindergarten and advocates 
teaching Icft-brain/rigbl-brain domi- 
nance. Because many children have 
not yel developed the motor 
skills lo determine left- or 
right- banded control, she helps 
her students discover which band 
Ihey are mosl comfortable using. 

My second grade teacher was on&lt; 
of those who believed in uniformity 
Ibe classroom ("Children, all of you 
will write with your right bands"). She 
was once reprimanded for lying stu- 
dents inio their desks. I think it had 
something to do with Ibat dominance 
thing. It's sadistic when a child is learn- 
ing to wrile one way and then the 
Establishment tries to convert Ihe poor 
kid to the other. 

Some people are ambidextrous, 
which is the ability lo use bolh bands 
equally. I haven't found much informa- 
tion on these people, bul I know 
enough to say 1 don't trust them They 
strike me as indecisive tbey don'l have 
to own up lo what orientation Ihey 
bave. Being ambidextrous has advan- 



There are a lol of famous left-hand- 
ed people, like Michelangelo, Leonardo 
da Vinci. Jack the Ripper and the 
Boston Strangles You could say we 
lefties have a predilection for becoming 
artists or moss murderers. I'd jusl 
about kill for the opportunity to be a 
full-lime student able to spend more 
lime on my artwork. Hopefully il won't 
come to that; insurance premiums are 
high right now. 

All joking aside, mankind has long 
harbored prejudices against leflies. but 
left-handed people arc the only ones in 
their right minds and right-handed peo- 
ple arc out of theirs 1 have Ihe proof! 

Some right-banded person during 
ancienl Roman times came up with 
'tight laws," which governed every- 
thing the Roman Empire did People 
bad to gel up from Ihe right side of the 
bed and drive on the right side of the 
road, not lo mention write and eal wilh 
their right hands. Furthermore. Ibe

Ambidextrous people could do twice 
tbe work in half the lime. But wouldn't 
il be a quandary for them lo try to 
decide which hand lo use every time 
Ihey go lo do something 1 I wouldn't 
want lhat worry. 



ics a bad rep long 
before Ibai lack tbe 
Ripper fellow showed up. 

I have plenty more facts about the 
pattern of unfairness of right-banders 
towards leflies: 

The Eastern Orthodox church was 
the first lo splil wilh tbe Holy Roman 
Empire over'bow to moke Ihe sign of 
Ihe cross Now you can cross yourself 
lefl-to-righl or righl-to-left Take your 
pick. 

The Church of England splil wilh 
Ihe Caiholics when Henry the Eighth 
desired a divorce. What do you expect 
from a country lhat drives on the lefi 



side of the road? 

When in court we raise our right 
hands-not our left and swear to God to 
tell Ihe truth. When we drive ou.r cars lo 
an intersection, it's the car lo our right 
thai has ihe right-of-way. As a writer, I 
express my constitutional rights to free- 
dom of speech in a country cstoblishcd 
on a foundation of common civil rigbts 
- ore you getting ihis, c 
behind somewhere? 

In our brains, there ai 
enecs in tbe thought processes of a 
brained person and a "right minded" 
one On a basic level, a left brainier is 
more rational wilh a methodical sense 
of progression; wberc a right-minded 
person is more emotionally prone to the 
whims of his or her libido. Subjects 
such as math, language, science, logic 
and writing arc the mosl common traits 
of left-brain dominance. On Ihe other 
side, music, art, dance, sculpture, per- 
ception and fantasy are unique to right- 
brain dominance. 

All of this sounds like forlune- 
lelling lo me. bul no mailer whal 
you hear, it's as good an excuse as 
I've beard to dale. Some of the theo- 
ries that the psychological experts 
come up with make you wonder if 
they are orally fixated with a foot 
fetish. 

Many of us left-banded, 

right-brained people live perplexed 

y Ihe sileni rules of our righl- 

mded society We can take 

ilcasure in the beauty of a sun- - 

set without trying lo analyze 

it for irace elements When I 

Irink a cup of coffee and 

; of far away places. I have yet 

and bridge the boundaries of 

and space to walk upon Ihe 

shores of lhat far off land Walter Mitty 

ain't got nothing on me 

To some people. Ihis whole affair 
becomes a crusade for promoting their 
handedness and finding safely in num- 
bers. I'm surprised the government has 
noi yet pronounced a study on handed- 
ness as worthy as a study on how many 
people wash Iheir hands after ihey use 
ihe toilet when they think no one is 

I hope this hasn'l laken too much of 
the mystery from your life. We all have 
lo gel a grip on our lives, whatever 
hand we use In parting, there is a deep- 
er meaning we could sec in all of Ihis 
For myself. I like lo think the issue is in

Coming Out 

Achieving self awareness 



I viow coming oui as a homoscnual 
in be ,i Ihrec-part process. First, one 
ii him come mil 10 him or herself 

Set II v, one usually comes out lo a 

.|n&lt; nl friend or family member he or 
ilic II close lo And lastly, (he hardest 
pari «l nil, one comes out lo those 
family memben thai might not 
approve of homosexuality. This article 
i Hi. in .i in j three-part scries which 
ill offci tips 'in criming out. and still 
u i.Kin the process. 

Wll.ii makal someone an open 
homosexual? 1 think il is anyone who 
realizes thai they arc gay and cannot 
change Ibe fact Ai first this is a bnrsh 
[hanks to the pressures of 
. roups and heterosexual 
tociciy Moil of us are laughi that 
homosexual! arc evil and perverted 
creatures thai God hates. But once you 
realize that these urges you have to be 
intimate Wilh someone of Ibe some sex 
will not pass, then you have begun the 
coming out process. 

• II a) so now that you understand 
ih ii you ore different, what do you do? 
If you arc like most others who are 



dealing with their homosexuality, you 
probably feel like you are the only one 
in town who is gay. Afler all. homo- 
sexuals only live in San Francisco, 
right? Wrong. 

Homosexuals ore everywhere and 
you are just one of many. Dut how do 
you meet other homosexuals? I think 
the last place you want lo consider is 
going lo a gay bar as your first outing. 
Bars arc great for dancing and social- 
izing but, like the straight bars, meet- 
ing in bars might be driven by ulterior 
motives. Find a gay-friendly organiza- 
tion lo join, such as the one on campus 
called Alternative Lifestyle Student 
Organization (ALS O). Guy organi- 
zations will be more positive than a 
bar and their members are experienced 
in helping those just coming ouL 

After you start meeting other gay 
people, get involved. Make gay 
friends, go lo social events like AIDS 
benefits, join gay bowling leagues and 
volleyball tournaments, celebrate at 
gay pride festivals like the one in 
Chicago (scheduled for the first week 
of June). You will soon see that lead- 
ing a gay life can be very complete 
and more satisfying lhan hiding out in

Actions are louder than words 



To the editor, 

There ore whites who think blacks 
should not blankctly hold all whiles 
responsible for the plight of black peo- 
ple. Whites say we arc racist because 
we include all whites in our indict- 
ments. It is absolutely necessary that we 
include all whites because our (blacks) 
oppressors arc while; century afler cen- 
tury, whites have racially murdered our 
people by the millions in horrible fash- 
ions: We have been robbed for cen- 
turies by while people, and these atroci- 
lics continue lo this very moment. 

Black people can not assume ibe 
responsibility of differentiating between 
white people. For while people who do 
not wish to be viewed as racist and the 
enemy of black people, il falls lo Ibi 
while individuals to declare themselves 
Friend or Foe, There is not a way for 
to know that. 

Whites, through their actions, must 
openly show that they arc about the 
right thing. We (blacks) have no way to 
tell Ihc difference in white folks except 
in their actions! 

Once, brother Malcolm was asked 
by whites; could while people join the 
movement of Ihc OAAU ( Organization 
of African American Unity). Brother 
Malcolm's response was: "Yes. John 



Brown. Brother Malcolm was alluding 
to John Brown, the white revolutionist 
that led the raid on Harper's Ferry in 
1859. John Brown showed that he was 
about the right thing. He and his sons 
were committed to the liberation of 
black people and they demonstrated 
that commitment with their actions! 

So, we say to all while people who 
are not racist, [hat you openly declare 
yourself through your actions. Whites 
must moke special efforts to let blacks 
know who they arc; otherwise, we have 
not way of knowing. 

ft is not that blacks arc racist, il's 
only that we have no way of identifying 
a racist while from a friend of the strug- 
gle. ♦

'Roomates' looks at attitudes of people with AIDS 



Rctcnily. 1 hod the wonderful 
opportunity to experience Ihc television 
drama. "Roommates," o movie aboul 
two men from different backgrounds 
who have only one thing in common: 
Ihey both hove the 90's black plague — 
AIDS. 

Jim Riley (Randy Quaid) is an 
angry, rowdy, tcll-it-likc-it-is ex-con- 
vict who contracts the disease through a 
blood tranfuiion. His world is tumed 



upside down when he is forced to room 
with on uppcrclass homosexual named 
Bill Thomas (Eric Sloltz). 

What I like most about this film is 
Ihc personal relationship thai forms 
between the two men. They honestly 
cure about each other's welfare without 
the implication of being in a homosexu- 
al relationship. This intimacy between 
men is something that is needed in this 
society. 

In one memorable scene early in the 
film. Jim, who is suffering from excru- 
ciating migraines caused by a brain 



tumor, yells, "This isn't my disease, it's 

After hearing Jim scream his frus- 
tration of contracting a "gay" disease, 
Bill responds, "How dare you assume 
that I'm not hurling. I'm terrified! I'm 
33 and I feel like I'm 80. I want lo cry 
but I don't dare because it takes lung 
power to cry ... I don't even have the 
luxury of crying." 

From this scene forward, one sees 
the relationship grow between the two, 
until Bill dies of pneumo-cystic pneu- 
monia at the end of the movie. 



At their apartment, a mutual friend 
of theirs comes over to tell Jim that Bill 
has passed. Before she tells him, Jim 
already knows what she will say. It's at 
this point, I think, thai all of us can 
sympathize wilh Jim's character 
because we all know bow it feels when 
a close friend or member of the family 
has died. 

But it's also al Ibis point when wc 
realize, as Jim docs, what effect indi- 
viduals can bave on our lives and how 
important they are lo us.4 



'Crooklyn' looks at 70's 



By Dodlc Miller 

Features Writer 

Spike Lee's lalesl offering, 

"Crooklyn," is an authentic flashback to 
a lower middle class black family sur- 
viving in the early I970'i. 

The selling is quite like those of 
other Spike Lcc movies: summertime in 
a crowded metropolitan area. Unlike his 



cndci 



; lacks 



Tory, the heroine, lums ten in the 
middle of the movie. Despite her age. 
people can learn something from Tory 
about having courage in Ihe midst of 
adversity. The strength of the human 
spirit is demonstrated throughout the

Spike's movie, continued from page 4 



pray togther in memory of their 



movie especially between-all of Ihc 
siblings during a family crisis. 

In spile of their ages, the children 
can leacb older people about being an 
individual and the importance of fami- 
ly sticking together (Tory Tights a lot 
with her brothers, but when an outsider 
threatens one of the siblings, they all 
come together for revenge). 

One feature Ibal makes this movie 
particularly enjoyable is that il looks 
and feels like Ihc 70's. nol a 90's pol- 
ished iinilulion. Houses were painlcd 
in the carlhloncs colors'of brown, 
orange and yellow. Charactcrsworc 
bcll-bonoms. and there were beads in 
people's hair, and around Ihcir necks. 
However, the movie was realistic in 
the fact (bat the characters weren't 
always talking about what they were 
wearing, as people do today. 

Whether by accident, or on pur- 
pose, this movie points out the differ- 
ence between that time and present. 
Girls over the age of ten slill played 
with Barbies and jumped rope. 
Children ployed hopscotch and base- 
ball. Of course there were fights, but 
there were no weapons involved like 

Because the central characters arc 
black, a film can't be accurate without 
using some of the topics of discussion 
that were, and still are present in the 
conversations of black Americans. 
The subject of "good" and "bad" hair, 
a reprising Iheme in several of Spike's 
movies, comes up off-and-on but not

often enough to he distracting. 

Overall, all the elements of the 70's 
ore rather its the Hanna-Barbcra car- 
loons, Afro-Sheen commercials, and 
Soul Train. Most imporianUy, the sto- 
ryline was more than the icons of the 
decade. When taken together as a tola] 
package, this movie is quite realistic, 
entertaining, and sometimes moving. 

1 personally feel that this is one of 
Spike's best films. While il has many 
good features, there arc some errors 
that 1 think deserve note: 

In one scene, one of Tory's broth- 
er's exclaims, "Oh. snap!" Maybe it's 
just me, but I don't remember "snap" 
being used as an expression before 
1990. 

In a brief moment of unorignality, 
Spike uses the ever-popular-juvcniles- 
in-crisis-theme song- "Ooo Child." 
This song was used in John Singleton's 
"Boyz in the Hood." 

Aside from that. Ihc film is 
poignant-funny, moving, and above all 
I suggest Spike Lee's critics and
