There were no classes to 
attend last weekend, but for 
over 500 rPFW sluderits, there 
was definite homework. 

Over 500 IPFW students 
moved into the new 



Waterfield Student Campus - 
the seven building, 568 unit 
housing facility across 
Crescent Avenue. 

Like any large moving 
experience, there were family 
members along with some 
friends to help shuttle back 
and forth to gather boxes and 
belongings. 

Some parents stayed a 
while, walking the grounds 
with their children. Others left 
early, allowing their kids time 
to finish their suites and

slated, for those who wanted 
lo participate. 

During the move-in, 
which began Aug. 19, the 
energy was high. 

---'-'I'm happy they're here.

The parking predicament, 
which entails too few parking 
places and too many students, 
seems to resurface each year - 
especially at the beginning of 
the fall and spring semesters. 
Students find it to be a major 
stressor — something that hap- 
pens every year, just like clock- 

For some IPFW students, 
it is an annoying fact of life 
learned by experience. 

"I have to allow quite a lot 
of lime," junior Joyce Gillespie 
said of parking and getting to

Gillespie said. 

The number of students 



IPFW's website states that 
11,806 students currently 
attend the college for credit, 
and about 9,000 for non-credit 
classes. 

And David Danielson, the 
director of the Physical Plant, 
said as of a year ago. there were 
4,757 parking spaces. Of these. 
3,484 of these were designated 
larking.

Parking

THE COMMUNICATOR PAGE 



"There are enough park- 
ing spaces," Daniel ton said. 

He slated the problem is 
not the number of spaces avail- 
able, but where they are locat- 
ed. Because most of the classes 
are held on the south side of the 
campus, that side fills up fast. 
But the north side of the cam- 
pus is often empty. 

If the parking problem is 
debatably bad now, what will 
be the effect of Waterficld 
housing this fall? 

"1 hope (the student hous- 
ing residents) will walk across 
the bridge" Danielson. 

It was made easy for peo- 
ple to walk over the bridge, he

classes will Physical

if these Director 

students do 

choose to walk across the 
bridge, Danielson estimated it 
could save between 200 and 
300 parking spaces per day. 

Dependent on class 
schedule, spots are easier to 
find. Those attending 8 a.m. or 
8 p.m. courses tend to have an 
easier time finding a space. But 
even then, students need to be 
aware of where they're leaving 
their vehicles. 

Gillespie once took a 
night class, and for safety rea- 
sons, she often parked in the 
"A" parking spaces - and one 
night she got a ticket. She has 
noticed that often, especially at 
night, there are quite a few 
empty spaces in the "A" lot. 

Under discussion is 
Parking Garage No. 3. If built, 
it wilt probably be near the new 
music building, currently in the 
opening phases of construction. 
The music building will have 
an auditorium with 1,600 seals, 
and it would be impossible for 
the existing parking facilities to 
accommodate a need for that 
number of parking spaces. 

The decision regarding 
this third parking garage will 
likely be made next year. But it 
would not alleviate the problem 
any too soon. If the decision is 
made to build a new parking 
garage, it would take four addi- 
tional years before it would be 

The cost in building 
Parking Garage No. 2 was sub- 
stantial. About $12,000 per 
parking space. With 950 
spaces, the total price for lhat 
parking garage was $1 1.4 mil- 

A new parking garage is 
far from guaranteed.

Three attempts and a year 
and a half later, the approval for 
the IPFW specialty plates came 
through this spring from the

After the third time of 
applying for the plates by cur- 
rent Director of Alumni 
Relations, Jennifer Bosk, IPFW 
gained acceptance of the license 
plate proposal in March. 

The objeciive behind 
these plates displaying the blue 
IPFW logo, is to "allow alumni, 
students, faculty, staff and 
friends to 'Ride with pride' and 
acknowledge their IPFW spir- 
it," Bosk explained. 

"It's a great marketing 
tool when people see hundreds 
and hundreds of these plates on 
the road each day," she said. 

Bosk believes that to "ride 
with pride" is a way to show 
how proud those associated 
with the university are of being

We thought since you are

the college experience, you 

should know a few things to 
help you in the long r 



With the opening of the s 
dent housing, we arc starting to 
look and feel like one. but we 
are not there yet. 

IPFW is primarily a com- 
muter campus, which means 
most of the student body 
comes here to go to class, and 
then leaves to go to work, or 
somewhere else. Although the 
Student Activities Board and 
the other numerous student 
organizations do an exception- 
al job of keeping us on campus 
and properly entertained, we 



things about IPFW. Being a 
small campus, the professors 
are much more reachable and 
personable. Our administrators 
are friendly, and if you are 
friendly back, they will proba- 
bly remember your name. This 
is handy if you find yourself in 
a bine, Hieratic bind. 

You'll be able to walk 
though the halls and outside 
the buildings and see people 
whom you know all along the 
way. You may even be in a

Here's what to watch out 
for: parking. Like all college 
campuses, parking is abom- 
inable. Make sure to get here 
with plenty of time to spare 



driving through the campus. 

And for God's sake, be 
careful on the roundabout on 
the north side campus. Most 
accidents that happen there 
could be avoided if drivers 
would yield to the traffic 
already on the circle. There are 
too many instances where you 
are driving counter-clockwise 
on the outside lane of the 
roundabout, and someone 
might be driving clockwise on 
the inside lane. 

Speaking of the round-! 
about, you'll probably notice 
our new speed bump/cross- 
walk just south of it. Although 



be careful. If 1 
doesn't tell you that, the laser- 
like blinking lights will. 

If you don't like Subway 
or Pizza Hut, bring a lunch. 
Unfortunately, the food 
options here are somewhat 
limited. Don't get the wrong 
impression, both Subway and 
Pizza Hut provide excellent 
cuisine. But a six-inch cold cut 
trio twice a week and a Meat 
Lover's personal pan pizza 
with breadsticks the other three 
days gets old after a while — 
and expensive. 

By thc way, don't even 
ask about trying to find a Pepsi 
around here. Although Subway

We are with the players as

national anthem is played, even 
a rendition of Waltzing Matilda 
can bring a tear to the eye. 

Cynics might claim that 
the Olympics have no relevance

would say just it is just the 
opposite. Despite intense inter- 
national fears of terrorism, the 
main focus was on the competi-

Student housing woes: Roomate wanted 



Someone should invent a 
device that can infallibly set 
you up with your perfect room- 
mate. This way, you can forget 
the 2:00 a.m. wake-up calls 
from your previous horrible 
roommate that just wanted to let 
you know how drunk she really 
was, or the times when she used 
your bed as a dresser while you 
were still sleeping in it. 

Granted, it's pretty hard to 
get along perfectly with some- 
one all the time, but just think if 
there was a machine that could 
guarantee you the perfect living 
arrangement. You'd never have 
to worry about being woken up 
by the sound of the TV at some 
ungodly hour or have to listen 

his/her significant other so 
loudly everyone in northern 
Indiana can hear them. 

There are three types of 
roommates. The first is just like 
Mom. She asks you where you 
were, who you were with, and 
what you had for dinner. 

The second can only be 
described as an inconsiderate 
jerk who steals your things and 
never knows when to shut up. 

The third is the ideal 
roommate who is impossible to 
find. This is the person whom 
you never know is there., That, 
my friends, is the perfect room- 
mate. Someone who can't 
bother you because ; 
know they're around.

Simple luxuries, like gro-

Recently, I found myself 
in a predicament that I'm sure 
at least one of you can sympa- 
thize with: digging into my 
pocket and finding nothing. 

I began to think to myself. 
"okay, here's the deal. You're

small diner in the center of

inquiry, others had told me that 
the food was tasty and inexpen- 

As all sure things tend to

had been closed Tor nearly three 
years, and was now a bakery.

before it closed. 

Right away, everyone was 
very courteous and helpful. The 
dining room had a hit of a coun- 
try feel lo it and was sectioned 
into two rooms, smoking and 
non-smoking. 

With the quick service I 
received, I had my drink within 
the first few minutes of sitting 

It was Mexican Monday, 
so I decided to spice it up and 
try the special — chicken que- 
sadilla. 

Upon arrival, there was 
this fleeting, "this kind of looks 
like the one we used to have at 
school" thought, but with that 
first bite, I was proven very 
wrong. 

At only $5.95. it was 
bursting with onions, red and 
green peppers, and chunks of 
chicken. 

On the side came tomato 
slices, lettuce, cheese, sour

Omnibus Lecture Series to begin 

continue from Page One 



Williams. 

The Capiiol Steps will 
inaugurate the Omnibus 
Lecture Series on Sept. 14. The 
political comedy troupe began 
in 1981 at the Christmas party 
of an American senator and has 
continued for over 20 years. 
They have since recorded 23 
comedy albums. The group has 
appeared on "Good Morning, 
America," the 'Today Show," 
'•20/20," "Inside Politics" and 
other broadcast productions. 
Along with those, they have 
performed for five U.S. presi- 
dents since their inception. 

"Its political satire brings 
chuckles ... rave reviews ... 
guffaws ... and bipartisan grins 
all around. The satire hits the 
mark," according to a Wall 
Street Journal review. 

Performers in The Capitol 
Steps have often worked on 
Capitol Hill for both 
Republicans and Democrats, 
with the current cast working 
for 11 U.S. senators and seven 
U.S. representatives. 

Among the bipartisan 
songs they'll likely perform 
include selections such as "Son 
of a Bush," "You're So Vague," 
"Cheney and the Jets" and 
"Send in the Clones." 

James Earl Jones will give 
a presentation at the Omnibus 
Lecture Series on Nov. 9. 

While he's received 
acclaim for his acting - he's 
won two Tony Awards and has 
been nominated for Emmys - it 
is possibly his voice that is just 
as legendary. 

That voice has given 
strong and haunting lives to the 
character Darth Vader of the 



"Star Wars" series and King 
Mufasa in the Disney movie 
•The Lion King." 

His voice is also well 
known to viewers of CNN and 
he has worked for Bell Atlantic 
- the company that eventually 
evolved to what is now known 
as Verizon - since 1989. 

Among his other movies 
include the baseball classic 
"Field of Dreams" and his 

ing roles of Admiral 



"The Hunt for Red October," 
"Patriot Games" and "Clear and 
Present Danger." 

His Emmy nominations 
have come from performances 
on "Under One Roof and 
"Frasier" while his Tonys were 
for his work in "Great White 
Hope" and "Fences." 

On Dec. 10. Deepak 
Chopra will arrive at IPFW. 
Chopra is considered one of the 



societies around the world 
looks at the entire wellness of a 
person. 

He was once the chief of 
staff at Boston Regional 
Medical Center, and began a 
successful private practice. 

He envisioned a new para- 
digm to encompass a "principle 
that perfect health is more than 
just absence of disease," 
according to information pro- 






100 audio, video and CD-ROM 
titles available in 35 languages. 
More than 200 million copies of 
his available media have been 
sold. Among his best sellers are 
"Ageless Body, Timeless 
Mind," "Grow Younger, Life 
Longer" and "The Path To 

In the Spring Semester of 
2005, writer and poet Nikki 
Giovanni will give a presenta- 
tion. Her lecture will take place 
on Feb. 2. She has been writing 
since 1968 and is a best-selling 
poet, author and essayist, 
according to information from 
IPFW's University Relations. 
Her lectures are known for their 
humor, but she also insists on 
prc-L-iiiiiiy the truth. 

Her works have sold more 
than 100,000 copies of her 
works, including "The Love 
Poems of Nikki Giovanni," 
"The Sun Is So Quiet" and "The 
Genie in the Jar and Peppermint 
Dreams." 

She has been named 
"Woman of the Year" by three 
different magazines and is a 
University Distinguished 

Professor at Virginia Tech - 
where she has taught since 
1987. 

On March 17, commenta- 
tor David Brooks will present. 
His goal, according to informa- 
tion provided in a press release, 

live to both the East and West 



He is considered "a keen 
observer of the American way 
of life and a savvy analyst of 
present-day politics and foreign 



umn for The New York Times, 
with one aimed toward humor 
and the other toward current 
news and politics. Along with 
that, he is a regular for "The 
NewsHour with Jim Lehrcr" 

Brooks' works have 
appeared in The Washington 
Post, The New Yorker, The New 
Republic, U.S. News and World 
Report along with broadcasts 
on National Public Radio. 

The Omnibus Lecture 
Series will end on a musical 
note, slightly different than the 
type that is beginning the year. 
On April 13, the free presenta- 
tion will consist of vocalist 
Lynn Anderson and songwriter 
Mentor Williams. 

Anderson had a career as 
a crossover artist in the 1960s 
and 1970s. Her hits included 
"Rocky Top," "Promises, 
Promises" and "Rose Garden." 
The latter song became a No. 1 
hit on the country charts and 
cracked the Top 5 on the pop 
charts. Since then, she has had 
eight No. Is, over a ddzeri Top 
10s and more than 50 Top 40 
songs released. She has 16 Gold 
Records and has won the 
American Music Award. 

Williams is a prolific 
songwriter, with his songs 
being re-recorded by country 
and popular artists since the 
1970s. 

His songs include "Drift 
Away" most recently covered 
by Uncle Kracker and "She's 
Gonna Win Your Heart." Along 
with Uncle Kracker, Roy 
Orbison and Randy Travis are 
among the artists who have uti- 
lized his songs.

Band Reuieui: 

Franz Ferdinand, a 
hidden treasure 



bccai 



the 



My first introduction to 
Franz Ferdinand happened one 
morning as my wife was brows- 
ing through television stations 
When she flipped pasl MTV I 
noticed a video that looked 
interesting and told her to turn 
it back. The song had a catchy 
beat and a weird video, to I 
took to liking it immediately. 
My wife, on the other hand, 
thought it was stupid. I waited 
until the end (o find out the 
band was called Franz 
Ferdinand and the song was 
called "Take Me Out." 

They started out as a cou- 
ple of Scottish guys with an 
idea to "make music that girls 
can dance to," according to 
their web page. Their history is 



from 



band members originally not 
knowing how to play their 
instruments, to fixing up an 
abandoned warehouse to play 
shows in, and getting busted by 
the cops. 

The band started in 2001, 
but their first, sell-litled allium 
wasn't released until 2004, The 
disc case promotes "Take Me 
Out" and "Darts of Pleasure." 
There have been videos made 
for both tracks, and also for 
"Michael" and "40." 

Some of the tracks seem 
to start off on a certain style and 
different style 



smooth, making it sound like 
two different songs mixed 
together, yet you can still tell 
it's the same song. The second 
hall of the song has a catchy 
beat. Other tracks have obvious 
influences from older bands, 
such as the Beatles-esque 'Tell 
Her Tonight." 

"Cheating on You" also 
may have Beatles influence, but 
with a harder indie-rock sound. 

"This Fire" is a typical 
rock track about burning some- 
thing. The music of one track, 
"Auf Achsc," oddly enough 
reminded me of a video game, 
but the lyrics of course did not. 
"Darts of Pleasure" also has 
some outside influence, but 1 
can't place where from. It is a 
very catchy track. The song 
ends with some odd lyrics in 
German that have nothing to do 
With the rest of the track. They 
are compared with some of the 
new indie rock groups such us 
The Strokes, The Vines, and 
The While Stripes, but I would 
place Franz Ferdinand in their 
own category. 

Their influence seems to 
mostly come from British 
bands throughout the 1970's, 
but with more of an edge. I'm 
not sure if all the tracks arc 
ones ihat girls could dance to. 
like they had dreamed, but 
many of them certainly are 
upliL-at and catchy.

Chris Yahne is the Student 
Body President of IPFW. 

1 . Why did you decide to 
go to IPFW? 

When 1 started at IPFW I 
was 16 years old, so I didn't 
have the option of moving away 
from home to go to college. 
After attending IPFW for two 
years, 1 enjoyed die experience 
and saw no reason to transfer. 

2. What made you become 
involved in S 
Government? 

I wanted to become 
involved on campus. 1 had some 
friends in Student Government, 
so it was the most appealing 
student organization for me to 
become involved with. 

3. What are some of the 
goals of Student Government 
this year? 

With the addition of the 
student housing this year, IPFW 
now has residents on campus. 
We are exploring different pro- 
grams and entertainment ideas 
that will be directed towards 
these students, and make their 
experience here more enjoy- 
able. These will not be exclu- 
sive however; all of our pro- 
open and available to all IPFW 
students. Student Government 
is also looking forward to the 
beginning of the Student Legal 
Services program, and hosting 
another spring concert featuring 
a national act. 

4. How can other students 
hectime involved? 

There are two avenues in 
which one can become 
involved. If the student's inter- 
est is in the planning, coordina- 
tion, and implementation of the 
events Student Government 
holds, then they would want to 
join the Student Activities 
Board (S.A.B.). To become a 
member of S.A.B., one simply 
needs to obtain a petition from 



If their i 
government oriented, then join- 
ing the Student Senate would be 
more appropriate. The Senate 
drafts Student Government's 
annual budget, as well as bills 
that allocate money out of the 
Senate Discretionary Fund. To 
become a Senator, one can 
either petition as previously 
mentioned, or seek a depart- 
mental appointment from the 
chair of their education depart- 




IPFW Student Body President Chris Yahne became 8 
ment because he wanted to be involved in college life.

James Hardy. 

On a hoi nighl in July, he was 
certainly the happiest person in 
the IPFW Gates Ccnler, 

The former Elmhursi High 
School two-sport star and cur- 
rent Indiana football and bas- 
ketball player made an appear- 
ance with his fellow freshmen 
basketball players at IPFW July 
3 1 10 showcase their skills 
against a team of local high 
school all-stars. The Indiana 
recruits pummcled the all-stars 
132-98 in a game highlighted 
by dunks and alley-oops. 

The G-fool-5. 185 pound 
Hardy was happy lo be home, 
but also eager lo begin his first 
coltegialc cumpuign in two 

"BaskelbalJ is where my heart 
is," Hardy said, "We have 
played together every day and it 
feels good to come out here and 
have a somewhat organized 
game and put on a little show 
for the Tans." 

The game was more than a lit- 
tle show; it was a huge show. 



Nearly 1,500 people packed 
into the undersized Gates 
Center to watch arguably the 
No. I rccmiling class in ihc 
nation perform. D.J. While of 
Tuscaloosa, AL and Roberl 
Vaden and A.J. Ralliff of 
Indianapolis also participated in 
the game. White clearly showed 
why he is one of ihc lop power

Thai sentiment seems lo be 
spread throughout the class.

Hardy said. "And ii's kind of

But if he does pick Indiana he 
has a prelly good friend that can 
give him advice and guidance. 

*'If the lime is righl and that is 
what he wants lo do, it'll be 
great to have him on the team," 
Hardy said. 

"Bui he needs to do the thing 
dial's best for him and his fam- 
ily. It would be great to have 
him with us, he is a great play- 
er," he added. 

"I have been playing James 
(Hardy) since we were little 
kids down ai the (YMCA)." 
Johnson said. "So il is pretty 
much like playing against my 
big brother" 

Hardy is a busy big broUicr, 
Hardy has already begun foot- 
ball practice and has one day off 
a week to train for basketball, a 
totally different type of condi- 
tioning. 

"On the days off you have lo 
work harder than anyone else, 
basically," Hardy said. 
"(Indiana foolball coach Gerry 
DiNardo) and I have talked 
aboul it and he says I can only 
do two things al once, football 
and school, then basketball and

Busy man indeed.

along with a plethora of Ihc lop 
college soccer programs in the 
country and area high school 
teams competing. The pretty 
boy, curly-haired "Survivor: 
Africa" winner and avid soccer 
fan Ethan Zahn even made an 
appearance. 

"We kicked things off wonder- 
fully," Athletic Director Mark 
Pope said. "These kids really 
set a great tone for the rest of 
our student athletes all year

The women's soccer team 
came out a bit tepid in the first

up in the latter half, lightened 
down ihc screws on defense 
and attacked the favored oppo- 
sition. The men played defense

Pope said if the athletes play

Give credit to the defense. For 
the first 45 minutes they stood 
strong against an all-out assault

for every offensive possession

Miami was the ob&lt;

dominating the ball and the 
time of possession, as well as 
continually pressuring the 
IPFW defense. The Redhawks 
moved ahead 1-0 on an Ashley

about to roll over and die, 
however. They responded with
