Union Board asks for members 



Dear Activity Card Holders 

The Student Union Board 
needs your help. Our con- 
stitution states that the SUB 
is allowed ten voting mem- 
bers. We are also allowed 
ten associate members who 
train for next year to be vo- 
ting members. 

This year, your SUB was 
allocated $15,000 to use for 
activities for all activity 
card holders. The board 
started out with Its ten 
members and through the 
first semester up until now 
It hasdropped to four mem- 
bers. Most of the members 

a couple quit because of 
lack of enthusiasm of the 
students. This creates a 
problem because we have 
only four students deciding 
what to do with your 
$15,000. That's a lot of 
bread and with your help 
we may be able to find bet- 
ter ways to use this money. 
We have been trying new 
ideas this year and seeing 
what the reaction will be. 
Instead of having $200 teeny 
bop dances every month we 
are spending two and three 
thousand for small concerts 
such as Ethos and Cactus 



this Saturday and Bull An- 
gus last semester. We've 
also spent alot for adverti- 
sing because the money we 
do bring in at the door can 
be used for future activi- 
ties. 

We are also changing the 
midwinter carnival this 
year. It's pretty hard to 
build snow sculptures out 
of mud. We also checked 
the records of past years 
and found that a lot of mon- 
ey was gambled away just 
because there was no snow. 
So this year we are spon- 
soring a ski trip for the 
students and hope to raise 
'.^uclT" erithusiaSrn~ovcfTtr 
It's your money so we hope 
you plan on tripping with us 
up to Michigan. 

Now, what can you do if you 
are interested in these act- 
ivities or working on the 
board. We have our office 
in the Office of Students' 
Government (Room 1 09), 
Just stop by and ask for 
Info about the SUB or con- 
tact a member. We hope to 
hear from you. 

Sincerely, 
Russ Cane 
S.U.B. V.P.

Death Course 



\im^ 



— Now — perhaps for the 
first time i n modern his- 
tory — a few individuals and 
groups are beginning to 
take an interest In the 
take an Interest in the 
delicate subject of death. 
The usual attitude is that 
death is such a grim 
topic that nobody wants to 
talk about it. 

However, things are be- 
ginning to change and the 
Purdue Office of Continu- 
ing Education will offer a 
six - week course titled 
"Dealing with Death" which 
will start Wednesday, 
March 7, from 7:30 to 9 
p.m. 

During the six weeks, 
participants will hear lec- 
tures on the psychology of 
death, funeral home 

operates, body donation, 
postmortem examinations, 



organ transplants, the 
making of wills and the 
statutes which pertain to 
death, geriatric care and 
alternatives to exoensive 
funerals. 

One program will be made 
up entirely of a panel dis- 
cussion concerned with 
various religious customs 
which prevail at the time 
of death. Representatives 
of various religious de- 
nominations will part- 
icipate in a general dis- 
cussion with a question- 
and-answer period to 
follow. 

For information about the 
registration fee for the 
course and other details, 
the public may call the 
Purdue Office of Continu- 
ing Education on Its direct 
telephone line. 



'Young, Damned' 
is today's film 



A savage drama of juven- 
ile delinquency seen with 
brutal realism, "Th'e 
Young and the Damned," 
will be the Indiana-Purdue 
Regional Campus Film 
Series presentation, today 

Directed by Luis Bunuel, 
a name that appears on al- 
most every film critic's 
list of the world's top di- 
rectors, the movie was 
made In Mexico City. Bu- 
nuel has frequently been 
banned from his native 
Spain. 

On the outskirts of the city 
adolescent gangs fight each 
other out of fear, hate, 
lawlessness, and hunger. 
The stories of the poverty- 
haunted youths have not 



been softened. Each cruel 
outcome is faced with un- 
relenting realism. Bunuel 
won the Grand Prize for 
Direction at the Cannes 
Festival, 

The New York Post said, 
"Bunuel has supplied the 
incisive thrust of pitiless 
truth, the incident reduced 
to stark outline, unmodified 
by humanity, kind interven- 
tion, or the justice of hu- 
man punishment." 

Showings will be at 3:30 
p.m. in Room 146, Educa- 
tion Building, and at 5:30, 
and 8:10 p.m. in the audi- 
torium of Building A. Ad- 
mission is free to activity 
card holders and $1 to the 
public.

Dear Editor 

In regard to the letter con- 
cerning utilization of traf- 
fic funds, I might add that 
someone also Investigate 
the rules governing handi- 
capped parking. A handi- 
capped student Is required 
to purchase an "A" stick- 
er if he wants to use the 
handicapped parking facili- 
ties. Yet, if unable to af- 
ford the "A" sticker, the 
handicapped student Is ex- 
pected to shift for himself. 
As a handicapped student, 
I have encountered this 
problem for five consecu- 
tive semesters, not Inclu- 
ding the summer semes- 
ters when I scraped up the 
fee. Well, I'm almost done 
here, but the problem still 
remains. I just hope some- 
one can make It easier for 
another handicapped stu- 
dent who will have this 
same problem.

"Frankly Speaking" 



Phil Frank 



A few points concerning 
the recent Insane decision 
by the Supreme Court con- 
cerning abortion: (I) The 
coincidence of makingpub- 
lie the Court's decision 
when it did obviously help- 
ed to soften its impact. With 
the death of former Presi- 
dent Johnson and the sign- 
ing of the Vietnam Cease- 
fire, the Court's decision 
had to resign Itself to in- 
side frontpage small head- 
lines. The fact that the de- 
cision received less than a 
resounding splash In the 
news does not mean a wide 
acceptance of the ruling. 
We will see, from indica- 
tion of anti-abortion pro- 
life groups, a concerted ef- 
fort to nullify the Court's 
ruling either by a Consti- 
tutional Amendment or an 
action more appropriate, 
that of Congress removing 
the issue of abortion from 
the Appelate Jurisdiction of 
the Supreme Court. (2) The 
very fact that the Court 
decided to rule on the a- 
bortlon issue raised ques- 
tions as to the legitimacy 
of such a ruling. Many feel, 
among them the decisions 
minority, that the Court 
overstepped Its Constitu- 
tional powers^ legislating 
state statuates In 'foFty-'^ 
nine of the fifty states. One 
of the desenting justices, 
Byron White, sees the de- 
cision as "an exercise of 
raw judicial power" de- 
signed to usurp the power 
of the state legislatures and 
incoporate them within the 
judicial framework. Justice 
White further states: "In 
a sensitive area such as 
this. Involving as It does 
Issues over which reason- 
able men may easily and 
heatedly differ, I cannot 
accept the court's (deter- 
mInation)„ This Issue, for 
the most part, should be 
left with the people and to 
the political processes the 
people have devised to go- 
vern their affairs."Consti- 
tutional-La w-e Xpert, A- 
lexander BIckel of Yale 
feels the abortion issue 
"should have been regard- 
ed as beyond the bounds of 
judicial competence." And 
the other desenter. Jus- 
tice Rehnquist, argued that 
it smacked "more of judi- 
cial legislation than It does 
of a determination ofthe in- 
tent of the drafters of the 
Fourteenth Amemdment". 
It does appear that the 
Court has acted in an ex- 
tremely questionable man- 
ner. With the question of Its 
Constitutional boundaries 
up for heated debate, it 
would seem that the Court 
also acted arrogantly and 
without regard to the wish- 
es of the people. In a na- 
tion which places consider- 
able re spec t In its dem- 
ocratic process, the Court 
has pushed the results of 
this process completely a- 
slde. Opposition to legaliz- 
ed abortions have grown 



considerably in recent 
years, so much so that 
when referendums calling 
for more liberalized abor- 
tion laws were presented 
to the people in both Cali- 
fornia (1972) and Michigan 
(1972), they were defeated 
by a resounding 2-1 mar- 
gin. The New York State 
Assembly also repealed its 
liberal abortion laws last 
year only to have it vetoed 
by G ovenor Rockefeller. 
The people do not want a 
wanten slaughter of unborn 
children. The possibility of 
a Constitutional Am- 
endment to correct this sit- 
uation has already started 
Its course, and other legal 
actions can be forthcom- 
ing. (3) It would appear 
from the Court's thinking 
that their ruling came from 
the assumption that a hu- 
man life does not begin 
within the first six months 
of pregnancy and that as- 
suming that life does begin 
within that time frame they 
would not have so ruled. 
This assertion of course is 
based on the belief that the 
majority Justices are not 
insane and did not want to 
legalize murder. It there- 
fore behoves us to once a- 
galn question whether life 
"does " bBgJrf "aT "cbnceptTdh " 
and or during the first six 
months of pregnancy. The 
Court in so ruling has flat- 
ly stated that life does not 
begin within the first six 
months. It has in other 
words not given the issue 
of life the, should we say, 
benefit of the doubt over 
death. When the airplane 
carrying Representative 
Hale Boggs crashed in Ala- 
ska, did the rescuers as- 
sume Rep. Boggs to be 
dead? No, they assumed 
him to be alive and search- 
ed extensively for him over 
a period of days. They 
gave him the benefit of the 
doubt. Rep. Boggs did not 
have to prove life, he was 
assumed alive. The need 
for ambulance services and 
hospital emergency rooms 
are for the benefit of acci- 
dent victims. If a person 
is in an automobile wreck, 
he is assumed alive, res- 
cued from the car and rush- 
ed to the hospital to aid in 
his recovery. He Is given 
the benefit of the doubt as 
being alive, not dead. Our 
society, when questions of 
this nature arise has tend- 
ed toward life over death, 

but not the Court. The Court 
has taken the question of 
life and death for the un- 
born child and decided to 
play God with it. "Even If 
you are alive, we say you 
are not". Until this ques- 
tion can be satisfactorily 
decided death reigns over 
life. What If five years from 
now there comes a general 
consensus that Indeed life 
does begin at conception, 
are the women who had a- 
bortlons and the doctors 




who performed them guilty 
of murder? And what ofthe 
Justices who made such a 
hasty decision? Can we as 
a society live with the 
thought and memory of this 
wholesale slaughter? 

Finally, I think an analogy 
can be drawn here with the 
1857 Dred Scott decision in 
that although he may have 
a beating heart and a func- 
tioning brain and be-biolo- 



gically human the black 
man was not a legal person 
entitled to equal protection 
and due process of the law. 
Today *£ unborn children 
face the same situation. 
Now this may all be an ar- 
guement in futility but, I 
fear the Court has more 
than overstepped its boun- 
daries, it has led usall Into 
the beginning of a Dark 
Age. 



PERSPECTIVE 



(A weekly report) 
This week's author is 
Larry Strong, 
Student Senator 



Your Students' Govern- 
ment has been working 
since October to reoresent 
your voice concerning the 
Higher Education Commls- 
s 1 o n's re commendations 
and the frightening budget 
recommendations of the 
State Budget Agency, which 
would cause our camous to 
supposedly operate on less 
money this year than what 
we functioned on the year 
previous. 

In order to successfully 
fulfill our objective, which 
was to inform the student 
body, faculty, and citizens 
of Northeastern Indiana as 
to how this campus was go- 
ing to be affected, we felt 
that it was our responsi- 
bility, being the voice of 
the student body, to contact 
those persons who would 
do us the most good In the 
best possible places. We 
did just that. The best qual- 
ified Individuals that we 
could have contacted were 
our area representatives 
and senators. These men 
would have the final say on 
Issues concerning all re- 
gional campuses, and we 
felt that it was our job to 
tell ' them.ytLCMV^i^ student- 



body felt. 

As most of you know, the 
Education Study Committee 
was created specifically 
for that purpose, to not only 
Inform the public, but to 
correspond with legisla- 
tors in order to find the best 
possible means for us to 
counter the recommend- 
ations, and make our feel- 
ings known. 

Of course, we knew that 
this was going to cost mo- 
ney, so we asked the Pur- 
due Bursar's office for a 
$2000 supplementary allo- 
cation. To our dismay, the 
allocation was refused. The 
reason for the refusal I 
think Is rather interesting. 
Under Section 1, Part D, 
Paragraph 8, of the Man- 
ual for Administration of 
Purdue University Activi- 
ty and Athletic Fee Funds, 
It states that money may 
not be used by organiza- 
tions that in anyway "sub- 
stantially influence legis- 
lation." This sentence 
fragment leaves much to be 
interpreted, but who are we 
as students to have the right 
to Interpret what the Pur- 
due Bursar's office hasal- 
ready deemed illegal? It 
should be made known, 
however, that the Purdue 
Bursar's office is not 
really at fault. After all, 
they were just "going by the 
book." It remains, how- 
ever, that we are out of 
$2000, and our activities 
have been forced to temp- 
'^a.rily~i|ease.-=f&gt;We w©r*An-

formed that If we presented 
an "unbiased, pro-con pre- 
sentation of our views," we 
could then get the money. 
How can we morally pre- 
sent an unbiased, pro-con 
presentation on an issue 
tiiat our student body has 
come out strongly against? 
We would be defeating the 
purpose of the Students' 
Government. Representing 
you is one of the real pow- 
ers that we have, and we are 
not going to give that up e- 
ven if it means not getting 
the allocation. 

I have introduced a bill in 
the senate to create a vol- 
untary student donation of 
$.50 for the purpose of re- 
presenting the student body 
on all legislative matters 
that may influence them. 
This donation would be 
given during registration of 
each semester, and the stu- 
dents would be kept inform- 
ed on how their donation 
was being used. Since the 
Purdue Bursar's office 
thought we were "substan- 
tially" influencing legisla- 
tion, and since it is un- 
lawful to use state funds 
for that purpose, we are 
going to the student body 
for help. We hope that you 
will respond. 
Ihopethat the Purdue 
Bursar's office feels justi- 
fied In the sense that we, 
perhaps, were "substant- 
ially" influencing legisla- 
tion, legislation that would 
have probably helped this 
campus immensely. For 
their sake, I hope that the 
budget recommendations of 
"the State budget AgencfAtt 
not adopted, in the legisla- 
ture, for if they are, this 
campus may have to cut 
down on personnel. I would 
hate to speculate as to 
where the cuts might be-

. ..Junk Mail, Part U. 

Last week, we discussed 
some of the vices of junk 
mail, Its effect on the en- 
vironment and the harass- 
ment of the people. This 
week, we are going to turn 
our attention towards some 
of the methods that we can 
employ to slow down the 
flow of senseless and un- 
wanted advertisement. 

One of the commonest 
tricks to curb the flow of 
such mall is simply to re- 
turn the postage paid envel- 
ope with nothing in it. In 
this way, the sender of the 
unwanted material has to 
pay the postage to receive 
the empty envelope. He al ■ 
so wastes working hours to 
find nothing. 

A more sophisticated 
trick is to stuff the en- 
velope with packets of pa- 
per. This adds extra weight 
and increases the postage. 



More time is consumed as 
the employee has to search 
through the paper for a 
possible order. If a paper 
containing pictures, scrib- 
bles or short storys Is in- 
cluded, more wage earning 
time is consumed. 

The idea behind the war 
against junk mail isto raise 
the cost of operations so 
high that the operation can 
no longer stay in business. 
Another point of interest Is 
that it takes time and mo- 
ney to train employees to 0- 
pen the mail and fill the or- 
ders. If there is a massive 
turnover of workers, then 
there will be a steady drain 
of funds from the company 
treasury. As the funds are 
depleated, the company will 
no longer be a b I e to main- 
tain the expected wages or 
work force that add com- 
fort to the minds of the ex- 
isting employees. The one 
thing that will tempt an 
employee of such an insti- 
tution is to make them dis- 



satisfied with theirpresent 
position. One way is to ex- 
pose them to positions of 
better pay. Send clippings 
from the help wanted adds 
of your newspaper along 
with the packets of scrap 
paper. There are some 
ways to make their pre- 
sent job m o re disagree- 
able. Fold a sheet of paper 
In half with the fold at the 
bottom of the envelope and 
put a spoonful of instant 
coffee or pepper in it. We 
can also empty our ash- 
trays in it. When the paper 
Is pulled out, the contents 
are distributed over the 
person as well as the room 
and machinery, adding to 
malntainance costs. If the 
employees are driven to 
better jobs, then there is 
little umemployment when 
the company has to fold. 

Another method of drain- 
ing funds from the treasury 
is to have costly material 
sent out of the institution. 



Whenever there is anything 
offered for free or on a free 
trial basis, send for it. 
Ti»en cancel any further 
shipments or ' return the 
merchandise. All that we 
have to do is write "Re- 
turn to Sender" on the pac- 
kage and the company has 
to pay out money in order 
to obtain their material. If 
you don't want to bother 
with sending it back your- 
self, have It sent to a ficti- 
tious name and address. 
The return postage is still 
guaranteed, and when there 
is no such address found, 
more money is paid out of 
the company. 

It is everyone's responsi- 
bility to clean up our envi- 
ronment and our society. If 
we all come together to 
wage war against the dis- 
agreeable happenings 1 n 
our world, we can soon have 
a better place in which to 
live and raise our young.

Purdue Office of Continu- 
ing Education. 

Headed by Dr. O. Frank- 
lin Kenworthy, the crime 
purpose will be to make 
theatre-going more-enjoy- 
able for persons who do 
attend theatrical pro-

who have never before seen 
a live show on the stage. 

The first of the four 
sessions will be held on 
Friday, March 2, at 8 p.m.. 
In the Indiana - Purdue

the class will learn about 
such things as stage move- 
ment, how scenery is built 
and stored, theatrical 
traditions, how plays are 
cast and rehearsed, and 
other facets of the theatri- 
cal arts. 

Participants will also re- 
ceive an introduction to the 
three plays which they will 
see as the remaining parts 
of the course. They are 
"Canterbury Tales" on 
March 16 at 8 p.m., "Story 
Theatre" on April 11 at 
8 p.m., and "King Lear" 
on May 4 at 8 p.m. 

Following each of the pro- 
ductions, the participants 
in the course will meet 
each play's director, some 
of the cast members, and 
engage in an open dis- 
cussion and evaluate each 
show.
