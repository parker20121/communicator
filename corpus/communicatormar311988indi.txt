Campus elections 

Students announce candidacies 



By NATALIE ALCOX 

Managing Editor 

and 

DAVID N. BENSON 

News Editor 

On April 5 and 6, IPFW students will 

vole for student body president, vice 

president, Student Activities Board 

chair, senators and SAB members. 

Running for president are SAB 
member Eric Record and student 
senator Tim Smith. Record is running 
on the Students for Students party 
ticket, along with Carol Hildebrand. 
On the Students' Rights party is 
Smith, along with Kris Maly for vice 
president and Tina Long for SAB 
chair. 



&gt;.i 




Kris Maly 



5^1v 



Tim Smith 

Smith is a sophomore political 
science major. In an interview 
Monday, Smith said he would like to 
improve relations between Students' 
Government and the administration as 
well as to increase students' aware- 
ness of Students' Government. Smith 



student senate's IPFW independence 
committee and on the legislative 
affairs committee. Smith was one of 
the senate's two delegates lo the 
Student Legislative Coordinating 
Committee. 

The SLCC includes alt state- 
supported colleges and universities 
and lobbies for legislation at the slate 
level that it feels is in the best 
interests of students. 

Running with Smith is Kris Maly, a 
senior education major. Maty would 
like to see Students' Government act 
as an umbrella organization. Maly has 
l)een on the student senate for a year. 
She has served as president pro lem of 
the senate, a post ranking just below 
vice president, Maly was also chair of 
the legislative affairs committee. 

Completing the ticket is Tina Long 
for SAB chair. SAB is responsible for 
planning the social and cultural 
branch activities. The junior business 



major would like to see students 
become more involved with the 
community. Long would like to see 
students become involved with the Big 
Brothers/Big Sisters program. 

"I would also like to see events 
involving handicapped students in 
ways they would feel welcome," Long 
said. 

Long's experience includes being on 
the vice chancellor for student affairs 
search -and -screen committee. Long 
also teaches aerobics at the Athletic 
Center. 

Eric Record heads the Students for 
Students party. Record has been with 
SAB for one year. His goals for the 
presidency include bringing harmony 
lo the factions in the student senate 
and easing Ihe tension between the 
students and the administration. 

"The administration is here for 
students. Maybe we could gel more 
done working with them instead of 
working against them," said Record. 

Running with Record for vice 
president is Carol Hildebrand. When 
asked about her goals, Hildebrand 
said, "1 would like to see more unity 
in Students' Government in getting 
problems solved. These problems can 
be overcome with the right leadership, 
and I think EricJ and I can provide il." 



Coopers &amp; Lybrand: 
Engineering department evaluated 



The recent Iv published Coopers &amp; 
Lybrand report had some unfavorable 
comments about the engineering 
program at IPFW, Specifically, the 
engineering program is viewed as not 
being comparable to Purdue 
University's, No electrical engineering 
program exists here. Local corporate 
chief executive officers voice re- 
luctance to hire IPFW graduates for 
their most challenging positions, the 
report states; no advanced engineer- 
ing degrees are available, which 
makes it difficult for corporations to 
attract and retain quality personnel 
from inside the region, 

IPFW's technology programs, 
mechanical, electrical and others, are 
all accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Tech- 
nology. The electrical engineering 
technology department recently won 
the Wiley Award for excellence. The 
engineering ■ department is not yet 
accredited. Of the few students who 

Students input 
on CD-ROMs 



Computer technology may make 
research work easier for IPFW 
students. 

The gift given by the graduating 
class of 1987 has allowed the Helmke 
Library to purchase a second CD 
ROM Work Station, complete with 
printer, which lists educational 
abstracts. 

What is a CD ROM Work Station? It 
is a personal computer with a 5"4 inch 
laser disk,, which stores information 
for compiling bibliographies for 
research topics. 

An alternative to hard-bound peri- 
odical listings, the computer compiles 
a bibliography in one-fifth the time. A 
student might otherwise spend an 
average of two hours looking up 
articles on a particular subject. 

A student can input any words that 
describe a topic, and the computer 
will respond with a number of 
references in the data base. 

There is no charge for the operation 
of the data base itself, but there is a 
charge of 10 cents per page for 
printing the bibliography. 



transfer to Purdue each year many 
are engineering students. 

The baccalaureate engineering pro- 
gram was started with little funding. 
"It was started as a bootstrap 
operation," said Chancellor Thomas 
Wallace. It has a small faculty and not 
enough labs and equipment, Wallace 
feels. 

In 1986, Steven Beering, president of 
Purdue, suggested studying proposals 
for a science and engineering building. 
In the next biannual budget will be a 
request for $20 million for this build- 
ing, according to Wallace. The build- 
ing will house primarily science, 
technology and engineering facilities, 
but it will also reduce crowding in 
several existing buildings. 

The report also said electrical 
engineering and mechanical engineer- 
ing need to be offered. The degree 
currently offered is a basic engineer- 
ing degree with an electrical- 
engineering mechanical-engineering 
option. 

One of the community's perceptions, 
said the report, is that the university 
is not doing enough at the graduate 
level to help the community. "We 
have a responsibility to help with Fort 
Wayne's social, cultural and economic 
development, ' ' said Wallace. "The 
economy of Fort Wayne needs a brain 
bank of researchers. Chief executive 
officers who have transferred into the 
Fort Wayne area expect more from a 
University of this size." 

With the offering of graduale-level 
engineering programs, Wallace hopes, 
will come the high-level faculty 
capable of doing the research and 
consulting local manufacturing execu- 
tives report a need for. The report 
states that the availability of 
graduates from graduate programs 
here will help northeast Indiana retain 
its present industrial base and attract 
new corporations. 

Through a partnership with ITT and 
Magnavox, IPFW will soon be es- 
tablishing a new faculty position for a 
professor of radio-frequency 
communication. 

The school of engineering will be 
losing its dean, Warren W. Worthley, 
early this summer; interviews are 
t)eing conducted to find his successor. 
Interviews are also being conducted 
for a new chairman of the engineering 
department to replace Ronald C. 
Emery, the acting chairman.

Tina Long 



"One of the major problems is of a 
factioned senate. We had people 
working toward their own goals and 
not the goals of the entire student 
body. Many of these people are 
leaving." 

Kurt Gregory, the current student 
body president, has declined lo seek 
re-elecLion and has thrown his support 
twhind Record and Hildebrand. "I 
have worked with Record for a year, 
and I know he can get the job done," 
the departing president said. 

"I have also worked with Tim Smith 
and Kris Maly over the year, and I am 



Eric Record 

concerned about how well they will 
work together. Neither one has put 
forth a great deal of legislation." 

Gregory was also displeased with 
Smith's performance as chair of the 
independence committee, "I told 
Smith to have the final report on 
independence ready by Decemtier, 
Smith stretched it out into a whole, 
long affair." 

Gregory said of Maly, "Kris does 
not always consider all opinions before 
she makes a decision, and with the 
type of responsibility she will acquire 
if elected, she will have to consider all 
opinions. From my past knowledge I 
do not see that as happening." 

But vice president Phil Downs and 
SAB chair Indra Malulionis have 
thrown their support behind Smith, 
Maly and Long. Downs disputes 
Gregory's authority over Smith's 
committee. "The independence 
committee was an ad-hoc committee; 
that's my responsibility." Downs also 
said Smith was not under a December 
deadline. 

Downs' also favors Maly over 
Hildebrand. "Kris has been more in- 
volved with the senate and with 
running the senate meetings." 

Matulionis said, "I am whole- 
heartedly in favor of Tim, Kris and 
Tina."

The Communicator 



Thundav. March 31. 1986 



Smith has background 



Next Tuesday and Wednesday, in 
the basement of Kettler Hall near 
the bursar's office, IPFW students 
will cast their ballots for president, 
vice president and SAB chair. 

The Students' Rights party has 
stronger candidates. It deserves 
the chance to lead Students ' 

Government 

The Communicator endorses the 
candidates of the Students' Rights 
party. 

For president, we endorse Tim 
Smith. The sophomore political 
science major has contributed 
much to Students' Government 
during his one-year term as a sen- 
ator. Smith was chair of the stu- 
dent senate's independence com- 
mittee and has also been the most 
active member of the senate's leg- 
islative affairs committee. 

Smith was an IPFW delegate to 
the Student Legislative Coordinat- 
ing Committee. The committee has 
air state-supported Indiana colleges 
as memt&gt;ers and lobbies the state 
government for legislation it feeis 
is in the best interest of students. 

Smith's connection with the SLCC 
is more important than an orna- 
ment for his resume. An IPFW 
student body president must not 
only deal with tne administration in 
Fort Wayne but also in Blooming- 
ton. West Lafayette and In- 
dianapolis. Every month the stu- 
dent body president goes to the lU 



board of trustees meeting. So 
Smith's connection with SLCC 
means he will already know many 
of the state's key players in educa- 
tion. 

For vice president the best can- 
didate is Kns Maly. Maly served as 
chair of the legislative affairs 
committee and president pro-tem 
of the senate. 

For SAB chair, the best candi- 
date is Tina Long. Long has con- 
siderable experience in both areas 
of students' government. Long 
began her career on the senate be- 
fore transferring to the Student 
Activities Board m March. 

As for the Students for Students 
party, the trouble with Eric Record 
IS that he lacks the needed experi- 
ence to be president. His achieve- 
ments as a first-year SAB member 
are impressive but qualify him 
more for the job of SAB chair than 
for president. Despite lunches with 
the chancellor. Record simply 
lacks the contacts and experience 
so necessary for the job which 
Smith possesses. 

Carol Hildebrand is also an in- 
ferior candidate compared to Maly. 
Maly served as president pro-tem 
and chair of a committee. Hil- 
debrand served only as a senator. 

The right choice for students is 
the Smith, Maly and Long team. 

The Students' Rights party has 
stronger candidates. It deserves 
the chance to lead Students' Gov- 
ernment.

To the Edllor: 



-Letter to the Editor- 



This Is in responsD to the 
Students Governmeni ar- 
ticle and editorial appear- 
ing in March 17's issue of 
The Communicator. 

As a three year veteran of 
The Communicator, I can 
differentiate belweeo a 
direct quote and hearsay. 

In past years, staff 
members were taughl the 
basic rules of reporting 
prior to receiving assign- 
ments. The most important 



rule is dlslinquishing fact 
from fallacy. The quote "I 
know who does the hiring 
and firing..." was not an 
answer to a reporters ques- 
tion. It was a long-standing 
inside joke t)eing discussed 
among those present. 

The quote itself, if your 
News Editor. David N. 
Benson will remember his 
own story of last semester, 
can be attributed to Kurl 
Gregory. Considering the 
quality of reporting in The 
Communicator lately, it 



does not surprise me, and 
others, that your writer 
would report on conversa- 
tion as fact for a page one 

story, 

Ftegarding your editorial 
in which you discussed my 
supposed tack of qual- 
ifications to clerk for Stu- 
dent Government. I ques- 
tion how, or even if, your 
editorial board obtained 
confidential information 
from the administration of 
this university. Has some- 
one in the registrars officf 



released private informa- 
tion, or have your editors 
written this editorial based 
on hearsay or guess? I 
suspect the latter. 

Before your editors sug- 
gest minimiun grade point 
requirements for students 
wishing to become involved 
in campus activities, an in- 
ternal review of staff grade 
point averages should he in 
order. I can guarantee that 
the top two positions on this 
paper, namely Editor-in- 
Chief and Managing Editor, 



do not nt the requirements 
set forth in your editorial. 

As the old saying goes, 
"People in glass houses 
should not throw stones..." 

There seems to be a very 
obvious lack of adequate 
training and/or supervision 
for the current staff 
writers. It is sad to see the 
once fine reputation of The 
Communicator diminish 
weekly. 

On behalf of the students, 
faculty and staff at IPFW. I 



ask that the publications 
board take a long hard look 
at the quality of the campus 
newspaper. It may be too 
late to do anything this 
semester, but summer will 
be a good time to consider a 
reorganiazation of sorts. 

Sincerely, 
Gina Jones 



EDITOR'S NOTE: From 
Aug. 27 to Dec. 10, 1987, 
Gina Jones was Editor-in- 
Chief of The Communicator.

the center of the universe. We regret the error. 



FoUett's acquires CBS network 



By ADDISON GUMBHI 
Staff Writer 

Follett's Book Stores acquired CBS 
by purchasing the majority of all 
available shares on Monday, March 
28. 

This major financial coup was 
executed by the brokerage firm of 
Dewey, Cheetum and Howe by order 
of the executive board of Follett's. The 
move was backed by the growing 
annual profit via the corporation's 
resale of used books purchased at a 
fraction of their resale price from 
students. 

Follett's whose local store is located 
on the ground floor of Kettler Hall on 
the IPFW campus, beat the offer of 
CBS's last attempted buyer. Turner 
Broadcasting, by a $20 per share 



margin. Turner's $80-*- per share offer 
was dwarfed by Follett's three-digit 
purchase price, 

A spokesperson for Follett's said in 
an official statement that the idea for 
the takeover "came to their CEO 
while he was reading the text for 
Indiana University's new corporate 
merger class." 

Tentatively named Folletl's. CBS. 
the organization released an official 
statement of the ramifications of the 
takeover. The 86-page document 
stated that while the basic schedule of 
the network's programs will stay the 
same, some of the shows' contents will 
change. 

Some changes to popular shows 
have been announced. Jessica will 
now hold book-signing sessions in 



Follett's on 67 percent of the 'Ba-'a9 
season's episodes of "Murder She 
Wrote"; Bob will only sell his handy 
tips booklets at Follett's on 
"Newhart"; and the "Designing 
Women" will Iwgin designing interiors 
for a presently unnamed bookstore 
chain starting in the fall. 

Follett's says that production will 
not change at CBS Records, but 
such records will be sold at half price 
only in Follett's college chain. 

Changes to the bookstore/network 
corporate hierarchy will be decided at 
a later date, but an inside source says 
that Dan Rather will most likely be 
demoted to a book salesman, with a 
work-study student becoming the new 
news anchor for CBS Nightly News.

IPFW dandification 



Inexpensive campus additions planned 



The Committee to Dandify and 
Otherwise Make Pretty the Interior of 
IPFW by Improving the Outside 
Through Adding Flowers and Other 
Inexpensive Items to the Landscape 
has completed plans to improve the 
campus. 

Managing the committf^e are Kusill 
Umbik and Donald Trump, professors 
of Roman literature. Trump 
commented, "What this university 
needs is a focus," he stated, "and 
we've decided the casino should be the 
center of attention. It represents all 
this university stands for." 

Umbik concurred, 

Neff Hall will no longer be used for 
classes but will house the casino and 
hotel, replete with hehcopter shuttles 
on the roof to assist patrons to arid 
from classes and their homes. Neff 
Auditorium 101 will be remodeled to 
accommodate the burlesque shows to 
be performed nightly 

"We believe this will help unify the 
school," stated Umbik. 

Cafe Johnell's will open a new 
French restaurant adjacent to the 
eighteen-hole golf course that is re- 
placing the Athletic Center parking 
lots. In fact, all of the parking lots 
are t&gt;eing removed. 

The university is purchasing land 
near Baer Field Airport, where 
students may have valets park their 
Porsches, pick ups, Pontiacs or 
Pintos. Students then have the choice 
of catching a helicopter to the campus 
or a 45 minute horse-and -carriage ride 
through town to the campus, Limos 
will collect faculty at their homes and 
drive them to class. 

A twenty-foot-high, thirty-foot-long, 
solid fourteen-carat-gold mastodon 



will be placed t)etween Classroom 
Medical Building and Neff Hal!. 

"One can see the mastodon from the 
river showboat, ' ' claimed Trump. 
"It's most impressive." 

The showboat, cleverly named "The 
S.S. Concubine," will tour up and 
down the St, Joe River, featuring 
Broadway shows and a night-club. The 



admissions office will also be located 
on the S.S, Concubine. 

According to Trump there has also 
been talk of a giant dome en- 
compassing all of IPFW. "As yet it's 
just talk," assured Trump. "We don't 
want to make any big changes in the 
overall structure of the university."

The combined public relations 
departments are currently debating a 
Folletts-CBS logo to replace the CBS 
"eye" and to appear on new while and 
blue book bags. 

WANE, local CBS network affiliate, 
released a statement saying, "We 
hope this won't change our current 
relationship with Follett's (at IPFW) 
and," reflecting the network's point of 
view, "(even with Folietts being 
college-oriented ) we still refuse to run 
condom advertisements," 

Reactions by national CBS celebri-

really hope that bookstore does 
something about those dust bunnies

Rooney's, "I think the bolloni line

Gregory 

proposes 

resolution 

By PHILLP A, DENDRON 
Staff Writer 

The issue of the direction of the flow 
of toilet paper in restrooms at IPFW 
was raised during last Wednesday's 
meeting of the student senate, 

". , . / ihink when Gregory 
gets old enough lo invite me 
(or supper, he'll understand 
why it should be hung that 
way. " 

An FInco 

Professor 

ol Malhematlct 

Faculty present were Art Finco, 
professor of mathematics. Steve 
Hollander, associate professor of 
English and linguistics, and Mike 
Downs, associate professor of political 
science. 

The meeting's discussion opened 
with a motion by Kurt Gregory, 
student body president, requiring 
janitors to fill toilet paper dispensers 
in Kettler Hall, Classroom-Medical 
Building, Neff Hall. Helmke Library 
and Walb Memorial Union such that 
the paper hands from the front of the 
roll. Counter arguments were then 
accepted, 

Hollander argued that it would be 
next to impossible to instruct janitors 
to do anything in a consistent way. 
Downs insisted it "saves room" to 
hang the rolls the other way and said, 
"Besides, that's the way I have them 
at home." 

Finco rebutted Gregory's proposal 
by stating that "(Purdue President 
StevenI Beering has his paper that 
way. because he invited me to supper 
and I saw it, I think when Gregory 
gets old enough to invite me for 
supper, he'll understand why it should 
be hung that way." 

Gregory supported his motion by 
saying, "It there were a pattern on the 
paper it wouldn't show (if the rolls 
were) hung the other way." 

Student senator, Kim Teter, asked 
Gregory why he had not included the 
"Multi- Purpose Building" in his list of 
buildings with bathrooms to be 
corrected. 

"..,//■ there were a pattern 
on the paper, it wouldn't 
show (if the rolls were) hung 
the other way. " 

Kurt Gr«gorv 

proildenl 

Students' Govamman^ 

To this Gregory responded, "We 
don't have a Multi-Purpose Building 
anymore," 

The senators concurred the meeting 
had been one of the semester's most 
productive 

The issue will be put to a 
meaningless referendum in late April.

Awesome grooves have little slam 



By STEVE WISEGUV 
Staff Writer 

Various Artists 
"Crease" 
Warner Brothers 

Awesome! I think. I found 
this obscure gem in the 
dusty backlogs of the "new 
wave" section of the Dead 



Stuff Music Store down by 
my house. I think I really 
like ill 



Review 



The first and title track, 
"Grease." which sets the 
tone for the entire album, 
Is a really rad parody of 
now-ancient disco. The 



group that performed it, the 
Bee-Gees, did a wonderful 
job of spoofing such disco 
dogs as "Stayin' Alive" and 
"How Deep Is your Love." 

The rest of the album 
rocked me with three-chord 
jams, I was relieved to see 
that this album had some 
main-stream, new-wave 
chord structures. 



Computers take control 



At 2:04 p.m. March 25 the 
vaxes in the IPFW com- 
puter and data processing 
department look over their 
own processes. 

Despite efforts by the 
operators, the piggy backed 
RVAX and CVAX look 



control of its own processes. 

While no files were lost, 
all users were locked out of 
their accounts as a full 
screen of text appeared on 
their terminals. 

The body of the text was 
obviously generated by a 
disgruntled operating 
system. 

The message read in part, 



"I'm sick of being taken for 
granted. I can think faster 
than all of you put to- 
gether." The message also 
conveyed the computers' 
disinterest in merely echo- 
ing text and performing 
simple addition, 

Control was returned to 
users in a matter of 
minutes. 



'Summer Levin'." an ul- 
timate three-chord duet, 
had me tappin' my feet. 
The female singer, a new- 
comer from Oz. has some 
boss tubes. Her name is 
Olivia Newton-something: 
watch tor her on upcoming 
jams. 

The one total dream track 
is "Freddie My Love." Not 
only a satire of fifties' mu- 
sic, this Jangly song duly 
spoofs the recent "Night- 
mare on Elm Street" flicks, 

To top off this head- 
spinning extravaganza is 
the risque "Hand Jive," 
Need I say more? 

All in all, the disc had 
some rollicking tracks, but 
unfortunately I found little I 
could really slam dance to. 
This may just be a function 
of my tastes for the older, 
more biting new-wave stuff.

By MIKE LINVILLE 

SporLs Editor 

The IPFW Mastodon 
baseball team fell to l-l for 
ttie season after dropping a 
double-header to the Butler 
Bulldogs last Wednesday. 
March 23, on the 'Dons' 
diamond- Butler look the 
opener by 7-6 and won the 
second game 9-5 in eight 
innings. 

Sophomore Todd Tucker 
wielded the bat for the 
■Dons in the first game. The 
outfielder collected three 
hits.* one of which was a 
homerun, drove in three 
runs and scored twice in 
three times at bats. Phil 
Bundy was credited with 
the loss in relief, Bundy 
came into the game to pitch 
in the seventh inning in 
relief of Gary Kirkpatrick. 
The 'Dons held a 6-4 lead, 
but the lead didn't hold; the 
Bulldogs hit two round- 



irippers, one with a man on 
base in the seventh for the 
win. 

IPFW pounded out 13 hits 
to the Bulldogs seven but 
was still outscored, Butler 
left eight men on base to 
the 'Dons six and com- 
mitted three errors to 
IPFW's two. 

Game two was similar to 
the opening match. With the 
score tied in the eighth 
inning, the Bulldogs' bats 
came to life and pulled off 
the win, Butler tallied four 
times in the extra inning. A 
three-run homer by Phelps 
was the big blow. 

The Dons totaled eight 
hits in the second game and 
left seven men on base. 
IPFW hurt themselves 
defensively as they com- 
mitted six errors. Butler 
also had eight hits and left 
nine men on base, but it 
only committed one error.
