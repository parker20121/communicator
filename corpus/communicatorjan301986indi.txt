Legal aid available to students 



Students Government and Legal 
Services of Maumee Valley Inc. 
(LSMV), have announced a joint 
program to provide legal assistance on 
ihe IPFW campus during the current 
semester. 

Legal Services will provide an at- 
torney or paralegal for two two-hour 
periods each week beginning Tuesday, 
February IB. 198G. The LSMV 
representative will be available to 
anyone on campus who has a question 
or a legal problem. The problem will 
operate in Room 225, in space provided 
by the Students Government 
Administration. 

Office hours for consultation will be 
each Tuesday, from 2:30 p.m: to 4:30 
p.m., and Wednesday from 6 to 8 p.m., 
whenever IPFW is in session. This 
schedule was developed so that as 
many persons as possible might have 
access to the program Itwas endorsed 



by Dean John Ulmer, wo noted an 
increase in the number of inquiries 
about legal assistance from both day 
and evening students, and who 
welcomed this opportunity provided by 
the inquiry of Legal Services staff 
earlier in the year. Appointments may 
be made at the Student Services 
Administration office in Room 118 of 
Walb Memorial Union, or by calling 
the Student Services Administration 
offices. 

Legal Services of Maumee Valley, 
Inc. is mandated to provide legal 
representation without fee to low- 
income persons in the seven nor- 
theastern Indiana counties of Adams, 
Allen. Huntington, Steuben, Wells and 
Whitlev. The executive director of 
LSMV," Gregg H. Haifley. explained 
thai it is possible that LSMV may be 
unable to provide ongoing represen- 
tation to some on campus because 




their income is above the federally- 
estblished limits for services, or if ihe 
problem does not match the prioril.ies 
established by the Board of Directors 
of LSMV. "Nevertheless,'* he said, 
"LSMV will be available to anyone 
who has an inquiry. If the interviewer 
discovers that we are una bit; to 
provide representation for your 
problem, the attorney or paralegal will 
be happy to guide you to an ajjency 
which may. We also can make 
referrals to the Allen -County.. E-ar-or 
other bar associations. LSMV will do 
the best it can to provide services to 
the IPFW community, within the 
restrictions of its mandate." 

Haifley ' added Legal Services 
maintains its offices in Fort Wayne, 
and encourages individuals with 
questions to call the office for services 
if they are unable to see the on-campus 
representative. Haifley noted that 
while walk-in consultation is possible 
(time consideration permitting), 
LSMV encourages telephone intake 
through its local service telephone line

Senate assists council 

By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

The Handicapped Students Council will be selling Dine-a-Male coupon books in 
conjunction with Student Senate. 

Last week, Student Senate voted to give the profits from this project toward the 
purchase of a Viewscan. 

Viewscans enlarge and provide differing contrasts to allow studenls with vision 
handicaps to read more easily. Barbara Johnson, disabled studenls counselor, told 
The Communicator. The Viewscan is an element of a computerized system which 
is compatible with personal computers such as IBM and Apple, includes a word 
processor and is portable, said Johnson. 

Dine-a-Mate coupons will sell for S12 and are for a variety of restaurants plus 
theatre and other recreational activities, said Student Body President Joe 
Motherwell. 

In other business: the Search and Screen Committee has been divided into four 
subcommittees to interview applicants for chancellor, said Motherwell. Those 
applicants receiving three "yes" votes from subcommittee members are referred 
lo the full committee for further consideration, he said. The Committee is 
scheduled to meet today (Jan. 30). 

Motherwell told student senate his last Leadership Fort Wayne meeting focused 
on economic development and how the new General Motors plant will impact the 
Fort Wayne economy. The decrease of revenue sharing as a result of the Gramm- 
Rudman Act was also discussed, he said. 

Mastodon sales at recent athletic events have netted $76.50, said Student Body 
Vice-President Gina Kostoff. Student Senators will continue selling them. 

Senator Jim Ruckel reported on research into crosswalk placement. He is in- 
vestigating the possibility of placing a crosswalk at the four-way stop. 

A proposal to have Student Senate buy a bulletin board for students interested in 
selling used books was introduced and will be discussed more at the next meeting 



Law service available to poverty-level students 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

Beginning (his semester IPFW 
students may lake advantage of a legal 
service offered to studenls who fall al 
or below ihe federal poverty level. 

Formerly, IPFW did have a legal 
counseling service to students. But 
Mary Brandt, Director of Activities, 
said that it was a total different 
situation. "Il was more of an advisory 
situation than actually representing 
their clients. The attorneys were 
volunteering their time. iThe 
program) was not a structured 
program as il is now," said Brandt. 
Consequently, after lime, the program 
lapsed. 



However, Legal Services of Maumee 
Valley, Inc. is a highly structured 
program. The group of local altorneys 
are mandated by Congress to serve 
low-income individuals who fall within 
123 percent of federal poverty level. 
The organization is limited in its type 
of practice, according to Roberl Zahrt, 
program administrator. "We can't do 
criminal law, (The service) does not 
duplicate other services," said Zahrt. 
Legal Services only deals in civil law. 

"We are concerned with providing 
the basic human needs." added Zahrt. 
This includes areas like food, shelter. 
The Federal Trade Commission, 
lownship trustees, the Social Security, 



unemployment benefits, Medicare, 
Medicaid, utilities collection, landlord 
dealings and things of that nature. The 
service also occasionally deals with 
divorce, in cases where there is recent 
evidence of recent abuse, according to 
Zahrt. 

The service will work on a volunteer 
basis. Students may make ap- 
pointments with representatives at the 
appointed hours. The representatives, 
both attorneys or paralegals, will 
volunteer when they have the time to 
fit these visits into their schedules. 
They'll volunteer on a monthly basis," 
said Zahrt. "We've got a pool of five 
attorneys and three or four 



paralegals." 

According to Zahrt, Ihere is no other 
type of outreach program specializing 
in legal services on other campuses. 
"We go where we think there might be 
a need," added Zahrt, who teaches a 
course called History of Man's 
Environment — a history of ar- 
chitecture — at IPFW. Many cam- 
puses, especially ihose with law 
schools will have legal clinics, but not 
anything like colleges like Valparaiso, 
Indiana Universily-Bloomington, and 
IUPUI. "Many campuses, particularly 
those with graduate law schools, often 
have legal clinics." said Zahrt. "It is 
not unusual to have services on 
campus." 



Calls for independence ring out at IPFW 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

Imagine two rival universities of- 
fering classes on one campus Both 
universities have their own ad- 
ministrations, registrars, competing 
admissions officers and faculties 
which meet separately to discuss 
issues and send resoluiions lo their 
parent universities. 

Both universities offer courses In the 
same areas, such as history, English 
and education. II students of one 
university wanted to take courses of 
the other, they would first need to be 
admitted to that university even 
though both classes were held in the 
same room, 

The description is that IPFW in the 
mid-sixties. Slowly, changes and joint 
agreements were made to eliminate 
the duplications. 

"In 1966, Indiana University and 
Purdue University agreed lo assign 
certain curriculum to certain 
universities," said Julius Smulkstys, 
dean of the school of Arts and Letters. 



Recently calls have been made for in- 
dependence by those who feel the 
IPFW chancellor should not answer 
only to the president of Purdue 
University. 



Fruslration with the status-quo 
cause many to call for an independent 
state university at Fort Wayne 
"Almost since its opening in '64, there 
has been talk of independence." said 
John P. Ulmer, dean of Student Ser- 
vices. 

As student enrollment increased, 
adminislraiivc problems caused more 
strains in the "marriage of con- 
venience" which had occurred. In 1971, 
the Commission on Higher Education 
was established to assist in prioritizing 
needs. 

An early action of the Con 



was to fund "an independent study on ' 
the status of governance 
arrangements by Purdue University 
and Indiana University for their 
operations in three regions of the 
state," wrote Francis T Borkowski. 
former dean of faculty in a thesis "A 
House Divided; Indiana University- 
Purdue University at Fort Wayne." 

Dr. Boyd Keenan, professor of 
political science at Ihe University of 
Illinois-Chicago Circle, headed the 
study team to investigate the best 
means "to achieve maximum 
cooperation In the management and 
operation" of joint university cam- 



puses. While Kennan could not make 
any clearcut recommendations, he 
presented two options which seemed to 
be more acceptable than the status- 

"The Keenan report recommended 
that a chancellor be appointed who 
would answer to both presidents," said 
Ulmer. Another proposal was for both 
business offices to be combined and 
Purdue to be given fiscal responsibility 
for operating the IPFW campus, said 
Ulmer. 

The issue of fiscal control has raised 
the fear of one university dominating 
the other's activities, leading to calls 
for IPFW independence from 
Bloomington and West Lafayette, said 
Ulmer. One such call came in the form 
of legislation introduced in the 1977 
General Assembly by Phillip Gutman, 
Senate Majority Leader, to establish 
the State University of Fort Wayne. 

Recently calls have been made for 
independence by those who feel the 
IPFW chancellor should not answer 
only to the president of Purdue 
University.

Independency at IPFW 
could spell t-r-o-u-b-l-e 



Would you attend "Northern Indiana 
University" at Fort Wayne? 

Years down the road, IPFW, the 
conglomerate of two of the most 
respected universities in America, could 
cease to exist. Well, not really. It would 
become an independent university, if 
some planners get their way. 

When IPFW was established, the two 
universities combined their resources 
for fiscal reasons. After expanding and 
being cramped in downtown Fort 
Wayne, it was evident that IPFW was 
growing. 

After moving to our present location, 
the college enjoyed the benefits of both 
universities. The two were still very 
much segregated — separate 
registration, separate bursar's offices, 
separate everything. 

To "streamline" business. IPFW has 
evolved to what it is today: a place of 
quality higher education where students 
enjoy benefits of both Indiana and 
Purdue universities. 

However, it seems this isn't good 
enough for some. Some people are now 
tossing about the idea of making IPFW 
an autonymous university — severing 
any bonds with those two great 
institutions. This ball game has been 
vollied back and forth since 1974. 

Even though we respect the idea of 
these people to improve IPFW, we see 
some very serious flaws in making 
IPFW an independent university. 

First off, would faculty recruitment 
and retention be seriously hindered? 

Probably so, in our eyes. Right now, 
some IPFW departments have problems 
recruiting faculty, even with the 
advantage of being part of Purdue 



college or a strong college with all of the 
benefits of two big universities? 

Secondly, would enrollment drop' 
That's hard to say, but based on our own 
ideas, we would say enrollment would be 
sorely affected, for reasons stated 
above. A degree from Indiana or Purdue 
would say a lot, mean a lot more, and 
probably be better respected than one 
from "Northern Indiana University. 

Thirdly, would accreditation be 
affected? This would depend on faculty 
recruitment and whether that became a 
problem. They are interrelated. You 
need a good faculty to have a good 
department. You need a good 
department to gain accreditation. 

Finally, would funding be a problem? 
This, again, depends on the quality of 
faculty that would be recruited. 
Acquiring funding is a result of 
dedicated people who are willing tc 
lobby for the dollars to improve their 
scliool. If Northern Indiana University 
recruited a mediocre faculty, it is highly 
likely that they would be less than 
enthusiastic in lobbying for funds. 

All of these factors, and many more 
are important considerations in deciding 
to go the route officials did in Evansville. 
It may be working in Evansville — but 
that is Evansville. 

Would it work in Fort Wayne? Would 
attendance drop severely? Would a 
move like this alienate any support, 
monetarily or otherwise, from Fort 
Wayne community members? 

A move like this requires careful, 
deliberated consideration and 
investigation, of course. Before making 
a move like this, the administration 
should think long and hard about how

Letter 



To the Editor: 

As a tuition paying student I felt that a contract between 
IPFW and me had been established. In return for the 
payment made for class credits, I was to receive an 
education in my field of study. 

My field of study is radio, TV and Film, Broadcasting, 
Telecommunication and-or telecommunications. By 
whatever name you call it, IPFW is not, has not and, as 
things stand, will not be anywhere near capable of 
fulfilling that contract. There is no equipment, no in- 
structor, no facilities. At one time a true facility did exist 
but was unceremoniously thrown off campus under the 
Giusti reign. 

Fort Wayne has three network TV stations, plus one 
independent commercial and one independent non-profit 
station. There are more than a dozen radio stations. The 
setting is perfect for a school lo provide this market with 
capable broadcasters — but doesn't. Instead, thousands of 
dollars are shot down the tubes on failing athletic 
programs as the academic level drops to new lows — and 
my contract is breached. 

Name Withheld 



Letters Policy 



Yet another controversy has struck 
our fair campus. It's a question of 
royalty. Not the sort of royalty one must 
bow and curtsy to — the sort that is paid 
by the publishers of books. 

Several instructors on this campus 
have written textbooks or manuals and 
contributed to anthologies which are 
used in the classes they teach. The 
students enrolled in these classes are 
required to purchase these books, 
racking up royalties for the author — 
ranging from 20 cents to $2 per book sold. 

This is where the controvery comes in. 
One question being raised is who will 
benefit from the sale of these books'' 
Another, not directly related to the 
controversy itself, but no less puzzling, 
Is why did we have to learn about this 
from an article in the News Sentinel? 

According to the evening paper, the 
IPFW Faculty Senate is in the process of 
recommending a textbook policy, "...if a 
professor has a direct interest in his 
course materials, he must distribute the 
royalties to students individually or to a 
university fund designated by the 
Student Affairs Committee." 

The same article stated the Senate 
adjourned before voting on the measure, 
and that the educational policy 
committee has already approved the 
measure 



So how is this going to affect the 
practice of instructors having their own 
work published for the purpose of 
becoming a required text for their class? 

At least one instructor was quoted in 
the News Sentinel as saying that he'd 
worked hard on his book and felt that he 
deserved any royalties resulting in its 
sale. If an instructor has done some 
innovative research or has developed 
some valid approaches to a specific 
topic, this proposed policy may prevent 
the information from ever reaching us, 
the students, who pay for the privilege of 
enrolling in the classes of our choice. 

Who will be the losers if the instructor 
disagrees with the policy that is handed 
down by the Student Affairs Committee? 
We feel that the student ultimately loses. 
Why impose a blanket judgment 
covering the students or a designated 
fund? Why not consider distributing the 
royalty money to several channels and 
create a win-win situation? 

If a designated percentage of the funds 
went to the author and-or a special 
account, we would all benefit. 

We, as students are here to learn as 
much as we can from our instructors, 
not to become embroiled in a game of 
administrative hardball. Please give us 
every opportunity to do so. We are also 
interested in a return on our investment.

Starks kept busy with internship through IPFW 



Thursday, Jan. 30. 1986 



By MARY II ARM AN 
Staff Writer 

As part of most of the degree programs offered at IPFW, 
an internship is required, or at least encouraged. Often the 
personal rewards a student obtains through an internship 
greatly exceed the credits being offered. This is what oc- 
curred during Deborah Slarks' Mass Communications in- 
ternship as assistant coordinator and publicity chairperson 
for the local chapter of United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) of 
Indiana. 

"In the beginning, I took this internship for the credits and 
the experience, but it soon went way beyond that. Meeting 
with children who have cerebral palsy solidified my support 
— became very enthused and dedicated to the cause. There's 
not another course I could have taken that would have given 
me that kind of personal satisfaction," said Deborah in a 
recent interview.

STUDENT DISCOUNTS 



UCP of Indiana serves over 20,000 Hoosiers affected with 
cerebral palsy. Every January the organization stages its 
largest fund-raising drive of the year — the "Weekend With 
The Stars" telethon. Months of planning and preparation are 
involved in readying for the telethon, as Deborah, who began 
her internship in October, soon found out. 

"I became a sort of 'girl Friday,' she said with a laugh. "I 
did whatever needed to be done. " 

The success of the telethon depended largely on local 
support. One of Deborah's duties as publicity chairperson 
involved drumming up support for the telethon. Along with 
securing public support and donations, she contacted area 
businesses to utilize their resources to help publicize the 
event. 

During the telethon weekend, Deborah's "girl Friday" 
role was accentuated when she found herslef playing several 
different roles. She was involved in the accounting aspect of 
keeping track of the pledges. A new total had to be reported 
to the "tote board" every fifteen minutes. Deborah also 
delivered two televised personal appeals to raise donations, 
and answered the phones when there wasn't a sufficient 
number of volunteers to do so. 

One of the things that Deborah, who is employed by 
Southern Heights Elementary School, found especially 
touching was when children would phone in and contribute 
one or two dollars. "Their little hearts were in the right 
places," she remembered fondly. 

The goal of the telethon locally was to raise 50,000 dollars 
It was the dedication to reaching that goal which kept her 
going through the long telethon weekend. Deborah, who 
commutes to Fort Wayne from her home in Churubusco, 
practically moved into the television studio and worked long 
hours to contribute to the cause. 

Now that the telethon is over, things have calmed down a 

bit as Deborah enthusiastically continues her internship. 

Although her internship is officially over this spring, she 

s to continue to work for UCP as a part-time volunteer.

The first time you have lunch at the Bagel Station, 
plan to set aside some time to just browse. 

This is not just another sandwich counter! Your 
choices include cold pasta and vegetable salads, soup du 
jour and a variety of deli-style meats You'll be offered a 

iriety of toppings for the sandwich, including sprouts, 
cheese, tomato, cucumber, mayonnaise and mustard. 
Try "the works" at least once — everything is fresh and 
crisp. 

Have your sandwich on a handmade bagel &lt; six kinds: 

thickly sliced bread, but be sure to leave room for 

dessert! 

The pastry (also made on the site) is one of the 
station's main attractions Their array varies, but _ 
sure to include a selection of flaky pastries, some filled 
with fruit, "bagelettes" filled with wonderful mixtures 
to order, and a coffee cake that is to die for. Even if you 
swore off coffee cake long ago, try this one! Fresh, 
plump blueberries embedded in a cream cheese coffee 
cake that is moist and just chewy enough to not crumble 

your lap. 

If you aren't the adventurous type, or just aren't in the 
mood for a mile high sandwich, you do have the more 
traditional choices of tuna and chicken salad sandwich 

Weight watchers out there, don't despair! There ar 
always a couple of salads that aren't mayonnaise based 
- the artichoke hearts salad is always good. 

Of course, you could always go right for the dessert! 

The Bagel Station also will prepare party trays for 
that hungry bunch of friends you have over on ' 

eekends.

Lady 'Dons rally late 
over Bellarmine, 60-58 



Bev milter, shown here In a recent game, hit a 15-foot Jumpshot with seven seconds 
remaining In the game lo lilt the Lady 'Dons to a 80-58 victory over Bellarmine College lost 
Saturday (file photo). 



At the Alumni games, the 
Lady Mastodons displayed a 
da2zling defense in a come- 
from-behind victory ° v «" 
Bellarmine College, 60-58, 

The Belles, who currently 
hold down second place in 
the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference (GLVC1, 
displayed great outside 
shooting ability from 
Stephanie Tracy, who scored 
18 points, and Roxanne Cox, 
who made her first five shots 
in a row — all from the fif- 
teen foot range — and 
finished the game with 16 
points. 

But on this day, Coach 
Julie Calahan's ladies were 
not to be denied. Trailing 58- 
51 with 3:38 left in 
regulation, the Lady 
Mastodons began to claw 
their way back into what 



became a 58-58 tie with only 
36 seconds to go. The Belles 
had a chance to win, but 
missed a 10-foot baseline 
jumper before Bev Miller 
from 1PFW swished a 15- 
footer with only seven 
seconds to go for the winning 
basket. 

Terri Lydy scored 22 
points and grabbed eight 
rebounds for the Lady 
Mastodons. 

Last Tuesday, the Lady 
Mastodons downed Hun- 
tington College, 57-19, in a 
non-conference matchup. 
Clara Trowbridge led the 
attack with 13 points in a 
game where the Lady 
Mastodons had four players 
scoring in double figures. 

The Lady Mastodons, who 
have now won three games 
in a row, are 8-8 overall and 
3^ in GLVC play, will host 
Northern Kentucky at 5 p.m. 
tonight. 




Men lose two; host NKU tonight

Staff Writer 

On Alumni Night, the 
Mastodons were defeated by 
Bellarmine College, 66-61, 
but not before giving their 
fans an exciting comeback 
thrill. 

The Mastodons trailed, 34- 
22, at the half, and the 
Knights quickly jumped to a 
commanding 15-point lead 
early in the second half 
before the Mastodons began 
their rally. Scott Reed and 



Schann Leathers started to 
connect on several outside 
jumpers and the team began 
to roll. With 18 seconds left, 
Reed drove the baseline in 
heavy traffic and made a 
lay-up to draw the 
Mastodons within one, 62-61, 
but Gint Davis sank a pair of 
free throws at the 14 second 
mark to secure the win for 
the Knights. 

Jim Crawford, a six foot 
seven inch center, led all 
scorers with 19 points, white 



Schann Leathers had 16 
points TorlPFW. 

Last Wednesday, the 
Mastodons traveled to Ohio 
to play Central State and 
were defeated, 64-58. Bruce 
Erwin scored 13 points as the 
Mastodons had four players 
in double figures. 

The Mastodons hope to 
start turning things around 
when they host Northern 
Kentucky tonight at 7:30 
p.m. at the Multipurpose 
Building.

Russell cites changes in IPFW sports 




By JENNY BLAKLEY 
Slot! Writer 

Tim Russell has seen 
many changes in IPFW 
athletics. Most of the 
changes have been positive 
since his arrival four years 
ago as men's basketball 
head coach. "Four years 
ago. there were virtually no 
athletic scholarships," 
Russell comments. "We 
have made a lot of progress 
in that area." 

The major important 
aspect of the Mastodon 
athletics' development is the 
movement into a higher 
level of competition. "The 
ability in all of the sports to 
be competitive in the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference 



at 



im- 



Coach Tim Russell 
(Fllephntm 



provement)," Russell 
comments. Previous to 
IPFW's transition into the 
GLVC. Mastodon athletics 
were not faring well. 
"(Before going into the 
GLVC). the men's basket- 
ball team won 27 percent of 
their games. Most of their 
competition were business 
schools and the seminary. 
They would occasionally 



play bigger schools, but 
most of the games were 
against minor competition." 
Russell says. "Now we are 
very competitive with some 
very good opposition. The 
entire program, in all sports, 
is competing very suc- 
cessfully against very good 
opposition." 

Russell cites a few 
examples in men's 
basketball. "We have a three 
year record of 50-33 against 
some strong basketball 
schools," Russell comments. 
"Kentucky Weslyan has won 
several national cham- 
pionships in Division II, and 
Wright State has been 
national champion Uwo 
teams on IPFW's schedule}. 
H took a lot of hard work, 
effort and cooperation to 
move us to that point . ' ' 

Although the athletic 
program has come a long 
way since its induction, 
Russell sees some im- 
provements need to be 
made. "The overall athletic 
program is relatively new; 
the budget is not what it 
needs to be," Russell states. 

Russell coached at 



Wabash Valley Junior 
College before coming to ■ 
IPFW. The position at 
Wabash Valley, in which 
Russell describes as "one of 
the premier junior college 
jobs in the country," reaped 
in its own benefits. "We had 
a lot of fan support. There 
was a full gym every time 
we played basketball. Also, 
there were excellent budgets 
for recruiting," Russell 
says. 

Russell is a member of the 
Indiana Basketball Coaches 
Association, as well as the 
National Basketball Coaches 
Association. Russell 
describes these positions as 
"extensions of my job." He 
remarks, "They are to 
generate interest and to 
promote the program," 

Russell performs various 
duties in his involvement 
with the associations. "I give 
speeches to civic 
organizations, to promote 
and 'sell' the program," 
Russell comments. "I am 
very involved in the com- 
munity."

Peterson resigns 



By LILLY LYON 

Copy Editor 

IPFW Cross Country 

Coach Barrie Peterson has 

resigned his position after 
two years with the program. 

Peterson cited several 
reasons for his resignation, 
among them the desire to 
spend more time with his 
family. However, he also 
noted most importantly a 
lack of availability of sports 
scholarships at IPFW as a 
major factor in his decision 
to leave the position at this 
time. 

Peterson joined the IPFW 
coaching staff after 13 years 
as cross country coach at 



Northrop High School, where 
he taught business. His 
years at Northrop included 
11 as track coach, during 
which his teams placed first 
in three sectionals and one 
regional. They also took 
three Summit Athletic 
Conference titles. His cross 
country squads were five- 
time sectional and regional 
winners, in addition to 
holding nine city cham- 
pionships. 

Peterson's future plans 
include volunteering as 
assistant coach to the 
Concordia High School track 
leam, whose roster includes 
two of his three sons.
