President John Ryan 
advisory board 



Hdiana- Purdue University at Fort Wayne 



nenemher 8. 1972 



announces 






president John W. Ryan 
has announed that an ad- 
visory board will be ap- 
pointed soon at each of 
Indiana University's six 
regional campuses to pro- 
vide a direct com- 
munications link between 
those campuses and the 
Board of Trustees. 
The trustees, in author- 
izing the boards last Jan- 
uary, said they believed 
"the Interests of the stu- 
dent, faculty, and the 
economic and political re- 
gions shared by each 
campus should be con- 
sidered in the policy 
decisions affecting that 
campus." 

Further, the trustees said, 
they "will seek the evalu- 
ation and recommendation 
of Che boards of the re- 
gional campuses Involved 
before acting upon any 
major policy decision con- 
cerning that campus." 

And, to Insure that there 
Is no breakdown in com- 
munications between the 
trustees and the boards, 
easch advisory board will 
Include one trustee. 

Other members on each 
advisory board shall be the 
campus chancellor, and at 
least three community 
leaders and six represent- 
ative citlzens-at-large. 
The board meeting will be 
chaired be the regional 
campus chancellor. 

The boards, thus, will 
serve as a liaison mec- 
hanism between the pres- 
ident (or, while the admin- 
istrative office exists, the 
chancellor for regional 
campus administration) and 
the external problems of the 
state. 

■The boards will advise 
and counsel the trustees 
on matters of primary In- 
terest and concern on their 
Individual campuses," 

President Ryan said. 

'This will have the happy 
effect of strengthening the 
University family as a 
whole, at the same time it 
strengthens each individual 
member of chat family. 

"The net result will be a 
srtonger, more efficient 
system of higher education 
available to the citizens of 
Indiana in every part ofthe 
state." 

Dr. Sylvia Bowman, who 
Just a year ago was named 
chancellor for regional 
campus administration. 



also welcomed the new de- 
velopment. 

"I said at the time of 
my appointment that my 
major responsibility would 
be to lead the different 
regional campuses toward 
functional autonomy and to 
improve the multiple ser- 
vices they render to the 
Individual communities In 
which they are located,' 
she said. 

"The appointment of the 
advisory boards is a long 
step toward that functional 
autonomy. In effect, each 
regional campus will now 
have its own voice in the 
deliberations of the Board 
of Trustees, 

"These boards will pro- 
vide valuable Insights, In- 
formation, and advice 
which will enable the Uni- 
versity to become more 
sensitive to the changing 
needs of these communities 
and to react promptly to 
recommendations that 

develop from the con- 
sistent, periodic reviews 
of local programs and 
operations." 

The University's six re- 
gional campuses are 
located In Fort Wayne, 
Kokomo, Richmond, South 
Bend, Gary, and Jefferson- 
vllle.

17 and 23. 



The Indiana-Purdue 
branch of Circle K Is co- 
sponsoring its annual Pen- 
ny Pitch with WOWO, a 
Fort Wayne radio station. 

The co-ed group and

money for a local disad-

Concerned scholar 
tells of Chinese life, 
foreign relations 



Ken Levin, a member of 
the Friend Ship Delegation 
of the Committee of Con- 
cerned Asian Scholars, 
spoke last night at an Ind- 
Inana - Purdue Con- 

vocations - sponsored 
lecture. 

Spending 31 days in the 
People's Republic of China 
In 1971, Levin found what 
Impressed him most "is 
how China has been able 
to solve the basic needs 
of that mass of humanities." 

To see, he further ex- 
plained that "everyone has 
enough to eat, clothes to 
wear. Everyone has a job 
and roof over his head." 

Then President Nixon an- 
nounced his proposed trip 
to China, Levin was in 
Peking. Two days later the 
group had an interview with 
Premier Chou En-lal. 
Levin, a former instructor 



In Modern Chinese history 
at Antloch College, said 
the interviw lasted from 
9 p.m. to about 1 a.m. 

The talk revolved around 
topics such as forlegn re- 
lations and relations bet- 
ween China and the United 
States. Some obstacles in 
the betterment of relations 
between China and the U.S. 
Include Vietnam, Korea, 
Taiwan, and the "tre- 
mendous economical grow- 
th In China. 

.\nother thing that Im- 
pressed Levin was "how 
happy the people are. You 
hear that in Eastern Europe 
evryone walks around 
glum. This Is something 
we didn't find In China. 
The people work very hard 
but they're always smiling. 
They're productive. Im- 
proving their standards of 
living all the time.'

Circle K Is trying to raise 
money by keeping tubs In 
the hallways at the I-PU 
campus unti^ Dec. 23. The 
group urges all students, 
faculty, and staff to pitch 
their loose change into the 
tubs as donations for the 
family. 

One tub will be located In 
the Educational Build- 
ing and one in the Library. 
On Dec. 17 the tubs will be 
pushed around the Ayr- Way 
and K-Mart parking lot s 
from 10:30 a.m. 'til 5:30 
p.m. The tubs will be push- 
ed frojn the I-PU campus 
and from SearsatRudlsell. 
A third additional tub will 
be pushed in the Times 
Corners area. The three 
routes will culminate at 
the corners of Wayne and 
Calhoun In downtown Fort 
Wayne. 

The money collected will 
then be counted at WOWO 
and the amount will be an- 
nounced over Che air, 
WOWO will be giving reg- 
ular announcements 
throughout the days of the 



Pushes about the progress 
of the tubs and their Circle 

K pushers. 

Circle K President Roger 
Ford said, "I hope every- 
one win pitch-in for a fam- 
ily that hasn't been as for- 
tunate as we have." 

"Last year," said Pen. 
ny Pitch Chairwoman Janet 
Hatfield, "we collected 
$1350. We hope tolncrease 
that amount this year by a 

couple hundred dollars." 

This Is the third year that 
this campus organization 
has sponsored the Penny 
Pitch in. a tub. The group 
started using a milk can co 
collect money in then pro- 
gressed to one, then two, 
and now three tubs as do- 
nations got larger. 

Circle K also uses Icstubs 
to collect money for the 
Multiple Sclerosis Found- 
ation. In recent attempts 
to raise money, the mem- 
bers pushed tubs through 
Huntington and Ken d- 
allvlUe.

Ridiculous residency 
requirements 

Earlier this week rhe United States Supreme Court an- 
nounced its decision to hear a case on out-of-state fees 
charged by state supported universities. The outcome of 
this case wlU be very important for this campus, as out- 
of-state students are charged double of what Indiana resi- 
dents pay. 

The particular case before the Court involves a Connect- 
icut!, but the situation Is the same as ours. The dispute 
centers not around residency requirements in principle, 
but their application. 

Both in Connecticutt and Indiana residency is contingent 
upon the student's, or his parents' legal residency upon 
his entering the university. Subsequent residency changes 
In later years are not allowed to work for the benefit of the 
student, regardless of the logic or ethics of the situation. 
These three examples bear this out: 

A fourth or fifth year student, in a graduate course of 
study, was required to pay out-of-state fees because his 
parents lived In Ohio. He was 24, married, payed Indiana 
Income and property taxes, had Indiana plate on his Indlna 
titled car, and lived In Ft. Wayne since his freshman year. 

Another student began as a resident, but when her parents 
moved to Ohio, lost the residency classification although she 
stayed In Ft. Wayne to continue here. 

A third found himself In the same situation as the second 
when his parents moved to Toledo. He had previously at- 
tended I-PU for two and a half years as a resident. 

In all three cases the student payed various Indlna taxes, 
were registered to vote in Indiana, and had no Intention of 
moving out-of-state in the foreseeable futurt;. In fact all 
three are "more" Indiana residents than Is the president- 
of Purdue University. But none of this did them any good. 

Neither university is likely to make residency require- 
ments sensible. It Is unfortunate we have to rely on the 
Supreme Court to make the changes. 

Counseling services 

perhaps the greatest tragedy for a student Is to find he is 
no longer interested In his chosen major field. Usually this 
occurs after two years of college work. 

Many of these tragedies need never have happened If the 
student had simply made use of available University re- 
sources. Extensive services are being made available 
through the Academic Development and Counseling Division 
of Student Services. 

First of all, there Is the Psychological Testing Center, 
Through this office, students can take interest and apptl- 
tude tests to help in making career decisions. 

Secondly, the Career Development and Placement Center 
helps graduating seniors find jobs. It is now laying plans 
for offering career counseling to undergraduates. 

And lastly, but most Important of all, the division coun- 
sels students who have not decided on a major, the so- 
called "homeless" students. The counsellors suggest ex- 
ploratory academic programs and other means to help 
crystallize for a student his vocational goals. 

Students who do not utilize these services are only ask- 
ing for later problems. If you are not sure of your goals 
see the ADCD counsellors, Nowl

The amerlcan population 
has got to be the laziest 
animal put on this earth. 
They have devised fvftry 
conceivable machine, at 
great expense, to reduce 
their work load. This is 
really great, because now 
they can sit around and get 
fat. And then to get rid of 
their excess of weight, they 
engage in a great expendi- 
ture to rent some machine 
to exercise for them. 

American lazyness isn't 
confined to industry. The 
utmost lazyness is found In 
the amerlcan home. Just 
take a look at the utensil 
in the kitchen that is used 
to open a can. Almost every 
kitchen has an electric can 
opener. Is turning a handle 
such a chore that you have 
to spend at least $9.98 to 
have It done at the touch 
of a button. Then there's 
the man who sits in his 
easy chair and Is hypnotiz- 
ed by the television set. 
If he doesn't like the pro- 
gram he doesn't get up to 
change It. He pushes a 
button on his remote con- 
trol. If that doesn't work 
he can always get his wife 
to change it. Getting up and 
crossing the room himself 
to change It Is always the 
last resort. Then comes 
time to get ready for bed. 
They go Into the bathroom 
and plug in their Snoopy 
toothbrush. Then they stand 
there and foam at the mouth. 
It would do them more good 
if they would unplug the 
toothbrush, hold their hand 
still and rattle their head 
up and down. This would 
not only clean their teeth, 
but It would woek some of 
the fat off that rests bet- 
ween their ears. 

Our factories are an ex- 
cellent example of our abil- 
ity to lessen our work 
load to a limple exercise 
of pushing buttonsand turn- 
ing dials, with the result 
being a mass of Inferior 
products flooding the mar- 
ket and an overabundence 
of waste products to 
strangle our environment. 
It Is no wonder that in- 
telligent people are turning 
to products that are made 
overseas. If you need proof 
of this, just take notice of 
how many European cars 
are on the road now or look 
at the manufacturer's 
nameplate on the chassis 
of your stereo. For further 
proof, look at the past ser- 
vice record of your car. 

The remarkable part about 
these animals Is how they 
can sit in their easy chairs, 
enjoying all of there use- 
less luxuries and bitch a- 
bout the high cost of living 
and how the factories are 
polluting the enlvoenment. 
Still they never notice their 
own stack of garbage cans, 
nor do they do anything a- 
bout the problems them- 
selves. Perhaps they should 
change their national 
emblem from the amerlcan 
eagle to the ^merlcap pig.

This past Wednesday eve- 
ning, for those few of us 
who attended, the Convo- 
cations Committee pre- 
sented Kenneth Levin 
speaking on the topic "In- 
side China Today." Mr. 
t-evin, a member of the 
Committee of Concerned 
Asian Scholars, toured with 
other CCAS members for 
approximately six weeks 
Inside Red China during the 
summer of 1971. The CCAS 
is an antl - war student 
group formed in the late 
1960* s with, quite natur- 
ally, pre-conceived notions 
about the roles of China, 
the United States and other 
Asian countries In Asian 
affairs. Their visit, pre- 
ceded by the ping-pong 
team and followed by the 
President, led them to see 
China in much the way they 
had hoped and presumably 
their Chinese hosts guided 
them accordingly. 

Mr. Levin's slides, re- 
calling the dullness of home 
movies, were, however, in- 
teresting for a number of 
reasons; 1) the lack of 
non-smiling faces led me 
to believe I was being put- 
on. Nowhere but nowliere 
have I seen pictures, or 
live situations, of more 
than a dozen people at one 
time where at least one 
person was displaying a 
non-smlUng facial expres- 
sion (assuming of course 
they were sober), I don't 
know what they were try- 
ing to portray to the photo- 
grapher, unless maybe the 
joy of living under the 
Maoist dictatorship, or the 
results of Chinese dentis- 
try, or that under the as- 
sumption of Communist su- 
periority, the hope that 
Chairman Mao will some 
day reveal to the masses 
that he has found the means 
for the elimination of the 
^ services, of a.lacrine; -.' 



Stan Jones 



2) the consistency of 
pleasant scenes portrayed 
by the slides could only 
be accounted for by a) Mr, 
Levin's selective photo- 
graphy, or b) a well thought 
through tour, leaving no- 

■ thitig'to' cha-nu*'any"ntfHjn- 
hlcetles to View. Presli'm- 
ably Mr. Levin liad an aca- 
demic desire to acquire 
knowledge. even if it 
did not run well with the 
prevailing propaganda, and 
that he would not withhold 
unpleasant scenes from his 
audience. I do not feel 
Mr, Levin is any less an- 
ti - Communist than say 
George McGovern. As- 
suming this (b), becomes 
the most plausible expla- 
nation for such steady 
monotonous viewing. 

Mr, Levin's slides and 
impressions were very 
complimentary to the 
Chairman, the situation 
presumably being better in 
China today under Mao than 
it would be under someone 
else. The Chinese, por- 
trayed last Wednesday, 
were undoubtedly belter off 
materially than they were 
In 1949, however^, after the 
Second World War and the 
Revolution the conditions 
were extremely poor and 
the only way out was up, 
whether Mao had done it 
or some sampan driver 
from Shang-hl. 

The fact still remains that 
the Chinese people are be- 
ing driven by as ruthless 
a dictatorship the world has 
known; and. If as the pre- 
vailing political winds 
seem to blow, relations 
with Red China areto "Im- 
prove," it mustberemem- 
bered that we must deal 
exclusively with the Com- 
munist government andean 
not appeal, unlike a Chinese 
Initiated move toward us, 
to the vast masses of 

-people.

I am 



woman 



by Dee Motto 

There Is paper on the ta- 
ble In front of me, a pen 
In my hand. There is hot 
coffee and a letter plead- 
ing for answering. There 
are ten minutes, at least, 
to devote to my good friend 
Mary before Dietrich 
screams awake from his 
nap. But I martyr myself on 
those ten minutes until only 
seven are left. Before 
children, I aent long letters 
to Mary, well-thought out, 
well-written. Now my 
thoughts spin round each 
other, competing for the 
time and energy expression 
requires, and what I hur- 
riedly pen is only barely 
legible. 

Former students come 
distances to visit me. They 
are looking for, wanting 
niPPflieshlngrhey remember. 
It is- not in words. They 
want from me a way I once 
was able to let them feel 
about themselves. They 
want a mood of absolutes, a 
tenderness for the world. 
Their unexpected phenom- 
enon^ several years ago, 
was to disc over — they 
thought— that thelrgrowing 
up and growing aware was 
-going to change the world 
yithout the world's having 
to be changed. Their inno- 
cence is gone, but they want 
it back and they think I still 
have it to give to them. In- 
stead, I give them break- 
fast and leave them to talk 
to each other while I change 
the baby's diaper and see 
what Phoebe is crying 
about. I answer the tele- 
phone every damn time it 
rings. I avoid them be- 
cause I don't know how to 
care for them anymore. 

Their bewilderment 
makes me hostile; I have 
given away more than I'd 
intended and It shows. lam 
in a rage over having al- 
lowed an attitude In me of 
possibility to disappear. 
Blind endurance Is not ap- 
propriate to my former 
life- management, my plan 
for survival, and my stu- 
dents justly hate me for 
having come to it. They 
thought I had taught them 
that nothing In lifehastobe 
any panlcular way. My de- 
mise makes them doubt 
their own visions, and lam 
embarrassed and diminish- 
ed by my not being able to 
prove to them that lam still 
Dee. 1 don't know where I've 
gone. {Where have all the 
flowers gone?) At po other 
time than when ore-child- 



ren people happen to wan- 
der temporarily back Into 
my life, am I more aware 
of the low prestige, the loss 
of self-esteem, even of 
self-knowledge, which ac- 
company wifehood and mo- 
therhood. 

There Is war on the earth. 
There is war In my house. 
There is war in me. All 
these wars because my 
people want me to make 
love uninhlbltedly and with 
ever-ready spontaneous 
desire; they want me to 
read to them and paint and 
play Lotto; they want me to 
talk cheerfully as I feed and 
bathe them. My people need 
me to activate their strong 
self-images and me to find 
each of them valuable be- 
yond precedent. And my 
people want me to be all of 
myself amid their needs. 

But I want a room of my 
own. And time to be In it; 
alone. 

During the past two years, 
I have begun to name the 
resentments and agonies I 
have experienced all my 
life — many of them most 
Intensely felt in my mar- 
raige and especially inten- 
sely felt since the births 
of my children. That naming 
process has freed me from 
being oppressed by clr- 
"cumstances and conditions 
so subtle that I could not 
even recognize them, but it 
has not freed me from be- 
has not freed me from the 
oppression itself. That 
naming process has led me 
to name new potentials for 
myself as well, and faintly 
to see that other arrange- 
ments than those which I 
presently have in my life 
are possible, and that new 
patterns of relationship 
would make me happier. 
But It — that same naming 
process, that raised con- ■ 
Bciousness — also reveals 
to me my thwarted plans 
and desires. So, I become 
a feminist, because I need 
the support of like-minded 
women and I need commun- 
ity with them in order to 
keep me eyes on the prize. 

Being a feminist in a 
male-dominated society 
means that I often feel an- 
gry, often bitter. Just mak- 
ing that statement makes 

me angry because It is 

true, however lopsided, 
that males do rule our so- 
ciety, but also because I 
begin to fantasize that those 
males who read it or hear 
it are then bolstered In 
their notions of their own 
self-importance. But It's 
all right. We women are 
getting smarter and strong- 
er, and falsely held ideas 
of male superiority will not 
thwart our Insistence one- 
quality, I Intend no threat; 
simply, 1 admire and sup- 
port my sisters and bro- 
thers who seek and end of 
the war between men and 
women, the End of the War. 
The goal of feminism is 
love'-telailionfehips- -McHout 



negative power plays. 
Should that goal be even 
neared, social organization 
will change radically and 
every person will know it. 

Not having had a vivid 
and confident sense of my- 
self and, so, not having kept 
my own name when I mar- 
ried makes me angry. When 
I consented — indeed, looked 
forward to it — to become 
"Mrs, Daniel Motto," I 
agreed unconsciously to be 
Dan's appendage. Two sep- 
arate persons agreed to 
share one identity: his. I 
assumed that his education, 
his work, his prerogatives 
were more meaningful and 
worthy than mine; it seems 
to me now a reasonable 
assumption when we both 
were presented to the world 
by his name. Even now I 
often am not recognized un- 
less I am with Dan — espe- 
cially if I happen to appear 
with a man other than my 
husband. Being invisible 
and anonymous makes me 
angry. 

Being excluded makes me 
angry. I smolder, for ex- 
ample, over the generic use 
of male words, "Man does 
not acquire authentic self- 
hood 'naturally' the way one 
acqulres.„a beard." 11 Van 
A. Harvey may want to 
claim that "man" In that 
sentence is generic, since 
presumably authentic self- 
hood is a possibility also 
for women, but I am 30 
years old and have not yet 
grown a beard. The lang- 
uage works exactly as it 
was designed to; using the 
word "man" brought to 
Hairvey's mind an example 
of male experience, not an 
Inclusively human exper- 
ience. 

That no women writers 
are anthologized in The 
Harvard Classics in New 
Harvard Classics excludes 
me. Also: Reading that The 
Women Filmmakers Film 
Festival in New York was 
boycotted by the dally 
newspapers. Studying sta- 
tistics which show the dis- 
proportionately small num- 
ber of high-paying of high- 
paying and prestigious 
positions in business and 
government held nation- 
wide by women. Having 
been preached to by 
males to believe in a male 
deity. Living in a country 
which has been governed — 
in the office of chief exe- 
cutive — only by men. Hav- 
ing mentally to transpose 
all literature about "man," 
"mankind," "brother- 

hood," and "liim" to make 
it apply to me; "woman," 
' ' womankind, ' ' "sister- 
hood," and "her." 

Being laughed at; being 
dismissed as crazy, pet- 
ty, neurotic, overreacting, 
selfish; generally not be- 
ing taken seriously — all 
make me angry. Last sum- 
mer I arranged for me and 
others to speak In Novem- 
ber about "Women In the 
' Churcii''' '-to pfeo'ple 1ft" rny 



church who gather at 10 
a.m. for coffee. Rumors 
reached me Thursday, but 
not until Saturday morn- 
ing was I called and told 
that, since a retired bish- 
op was in town, the cof- 
fee-discussion hour would 
be converted to a recep- 
tion for the bishopi Top- 
down decisions are anti- 
democratic and, there- 
fore, maddening in them- 
selves, but my added sus- 
picion that not Ed Roush 
or the Black Panthers or 
even the League of Wo- 
men Voters, had they been 
scheduled, would have been 
put aside, makes me very 
angry. 

Parenthood Is high on the 
list of sources of resent- 
ment and rage in women. 
Although recent research 
Indicates that all people 
have a "parental" In- 
stinct — it varies in degree 
from Individual to indivi- 
dual, but not on the basis 
of gender — which is trig- 
gered by the actual caring 
for young children, we have 
been unfairly led to expect 
that child-rearing is to- 
tally fulfilling for one sex 
(female), but not for the 
other (guess who). The 
fulfillment fantasy Is ac- 
companied In reality by 
the loss of adult authority 
for women (a mother's ap- 
praisal of the school's 
reading program is not ta- 
ken seriously, even though 
she knows whether her 
child can read) and a de- 
nigrated personal and so- 
cial status, as well as a 
humiliating financial de- 
pendence. Glorified mo- 
therhood without glorified 
fatherhood is doublethink. 
Being valued by the society 
more if one is male than 
If one is female is, there- 
fore, also doublethink: Do 
mothers who return to work 
when their families are 
grown have positions on the 
pay scale appropriate to 
their years of experience 
devoted to the all-Impor- 
tant vork of rearing chil- 
dren? Of course not, and 
that's what I mean by not 
being valued by the soci- 
ety. 

Someone recently com- 
plained to me that, although 
he sympathizes with the 
women's movement, he 
fears leaving child-rear- 
ing to the uninspired and 
uncreative. Shouldn't aU 
people be allowed to per- 
form the tasks which in- 
spire greatness In them 
(as well as being required 
to do their fare share of 
the maintenance work), the 
tasks which require their 
particular creativities? 
Then why whould all women 
be even asked--certalnly 
not expected I— to channel 
their Inspiration and crea- 
tivity Into one effort: 
child-rearing. People who 
are gifted In the caring for 
and nurturing and loving of 
children abound. Half of 
them are men. Anti-femi- 



nists would attempt to 
threaten the feminity of In- 
dependent, self-reliant wo- 
men by attacking them for 
their lack of nurturant 
qualities. Biology Is not 
destiny for men; trying 
to make It so for women 
is hateful and destructive. 

Children, children. Peo- 
ple who are not also pa- 
rents do not readily ac- 
cept my ambivalent feel- 
ings for my own children. 
My children need other a- 
duits as advocates (I am 
too angry, too demanding); 
they benefit from their in- 
creasing mobility -through . 
their experiences in nur- 
sery schools and with pro- 
fessional and familial baby- 
sitters, they are learning 
to feel at homeinthe world, 
away from me, and to ex- 
pect to be loved and enjoyed 
by adults other than their 
parents. 

Children are mystics. 
Learning from my children 
their peculiar relation- 
ships to the world is time- 
and emotions-consuming, 

Children are mystics. 
Learning from my child- 
ren their peculiar relation- 
ships to the world Is time- 
a nd emotions-consuming, 
too frustrating. Inconsist- 
ent, and destructive of rea- 
son and order for me glad- 
ly to choose full-time re- 
sponsibility for their well- 
being. I want time for my- 
self. They playfully impose 
on me, nevertheless, fresh- 
ness, Idiosyncrasy, and a 
compelling return to the 
essential feelings and act- 
ivities of life. The changes 
In me they create are im- 
portant to me, I love my 
husband and I believe that 
he, too, is entitled to being 
forced to be involved in 
their discoveries and pro- 
cesses. 

Anger and bitterness 
sometimes seem to be rot- 
ting me right away. I 
find I can't finally adjust 
to being put down, con- 
fined, excluded, disap- 
proved of, feared, threat- 
ened of rape, and hated. 
I resent - because I know 
myself as I am to be ac- 
ceptable - being made to 
feel I am not presentable 
unless combed, shaven, 
made - up, and carefully 
dressed. I fear and detest 
men's fetishes for 

"pieces" of women'sbod- 
les, my body. I feel beaten 
and ignored by the popular- 
ity of Playboy standards 
of female beauty, which my 
body does not meet. I 
resist being, first, body. 
I am woman. 

I am woman. I eat, sleep, 
ovulate, make love, men- 
struate, conceive, I think, 
study, dream, envision, 
write. I solve problems. 
I fix things. I laugh. I 
have ambitions, plans i- 
deas, talents. I whistle 
talk, mutter, scream, sing, 
whisper. I am a whole 
person, all by myself. , I

Student Services 

OFFICE OF FINANCIAL AID 
ENDEA VORS TO MEET 
NEEDS OF STUDENTS 



The President of the 
United States has made a 
scatemenc to the effect Ehai 
no student should be denied 
an education due to lack of 
funds. So to this end, the 
Division of Financial Aid 
is attempting to carry out 
and administer specifically 
to that statement. This Is 
the reason forflnlncialald. 
At the same time, it is 
the Federal Government's 
position, as well as that of 
the University that the stu- 
dent and/or his family 
should contribute as much 
as can be reasonably ex- 
pected toward his own edu- 
cation. If the student cannot 
raise the monies necessary 
it is the purpose of the 
Office of Financial Aid to 
assist them In meeting the 
need, be it in the form of 
Federal aid, institutional 
aid, or aid from the local 
community. 

The Federal programs 
are the Educational Op- 
portunity Grant, National 
Direct Student Loan Pro- 
gram and the College 
Work - Study Program. 
There are also Nursing 
Scholarships and Nursing 
loans. 
The Federally Insured 
student loan program is 
also available. In the future 
months the Office of 
Financial Aid will be play- 
ing a much larger role in 
this program, because 
there will then be required 
a needs analysis for every 
student applying for an 
Interest subsidized federal 
loan. This loan, though, is 
primarily administered 
through local lending in- 
stitutions, that is, all the 
banks In Fort Wayne. 

A dependent student- one 
living at home with his fam- 
ily - must first file a par- 
ents confidential statement. 
This may be obtained in 
the Office of Financial Aid 
and Is sent by the student 
to the College Testing Ser- 
vices. The results are re- 
turned to the educational 
Institution. Thlsisiheform 
that is used to evaluate 
the reasonable expectation 
of financial contribution of 
both the student and his 
parents. 

Many students at I-PU 
are in the Independent stu- 
dent category - a student 
who has lived away from 
home for some extended 
period, a married student, 
or returning veteran. He 
must file a separate form 
developed by the local 
campus office of financial 
aid which Is a statement 
of the family budget. This 
is returned to the Office 
of Financial Aid. 



By Anita Lamos 

Ac this point, the student 
must submit an application 
for financial aid. This is 
separate from the other 
form because the Individual 
if he Is still in high school 
may not have decided which 
college he desires to 
attend. The results of the 
financial statement may be 
sent to several educational 
InstitutlonE, with the actual 
application for aid being 
made to the Institution the 
individual desires to attend. 
The Office of Financial 
Aid then, when the affor- 
mentloned two forms are 
In their possession, checks 
with the Office of Ad- 
missions to verify that the 
person has been admitted. 
If they have then an 
evaluation of the family 
Income situation is per- 
formed and an award of 
some type or, in many 
cases, a package of award 
utilizing the various kinds 
of aid at the disposal of 
the office. The student Is 
then notified as to the type 
and amount of the award. 
This, understandably must 
be done early In the year. 
The deadline for applica- 
tions for financial aid is 
Fecruary 15 for entering 
freshmen and March 1 for 
returning students. Evalua- 
tion takes place in March, 
April, May and June, with 
notification of recipients 
set for July. 

There Is no actual dollar 
cut-off on Income which 
allows one to qualify for 
financial aid. This is, 
rather, based on a complex 
formula involving the num- 
ber of children In the fam- 
ily, the number of child- 
ren in college, the fact 
of whether or not the 
mother is working, and 
most Importally -the fund- 
ing by the Federal Govern- 
ment which constltues the 
greatest part of available 
aid. If the Government 
should allocate 100% of 
the monies the requested, 
more financial aid is 
available. If only 5C% is 
funded, there must be 
arbitrary cut-offs. The 
position of the office Is 
that they assist the most 
needy students until the 
funds are depleted. Very 
often, because of restric- 
tions many students will 
receive no aid at all. 

With the passage of the 
1972 Higher Education BUI 
monies will now be more 
readily available to stu- 
dents In the form of loans. 
At present a student may 
borrow up to $1500 per 
academic year and. If the 
family's income Is less 
than $15,000, the Federal 



Government will pay the 
interest on that while the 
student Is in school at least 
half time. The student 
would start repaying the 
loan nine months after re- 
ceiving their degree at an 
Interest rate of 7 per cent. 
As of March 1 the student 
will be able to borrow up 
to $2500 per academic year 
to meet their educational 
needs. Along with this 
change comes another 
which requires the educa- 
tional institution to per- 
form a needs analysis of 
each applicant and make a 
recommendation to the 
lending institution as to the 
amont that the individual 
may borrow on a Federally 
subsidized basis. If the stu- 
dent Is able to demonstrate 
need, the Government will 
pay the interest. If the stu- 
dent does not demonstrate 
need( the student or his 
family will be required to 
pay the Interest while he is 
in school. 

Because of the additional 
work to be done in connec- 
tion with this change, the 
demands on the personnel 
of the Office of Financial 
Aid wiU increade tremen- 
dously with the Im- 
plemenatatlon of this 
particular program. The 
wo;tk loan, and hopefully, 
the size of the staff will 
be Increased. If the re- 
quest for additional staff 
is not given priority, it 
seems Inevitable that the 
student will be the ones 
who suffer greatest. 

Because of inadequate 
funding on the Federal 
level, graduate students on 
this campus have never 
been considered for Fed- 
eral Funds. The rationale 
for this being that it is 
of prime importance for 
undergratuate students to 
obtain their first degree. 
If proper funding were 
given, full time students 
on the gratuate level might 
be considered, but the need 
is not as great in that 
area. 

The Federal Government 
is constantly revising their ' 
programs. One of the re- 
cent considerations Is that 
part-time students may al- 
so be assisted. However the 
Office of Financial Aids 
feels that if not even all of 
the full-time students who 
request aid may be assist- 
ed, there is no acceptable 
rationale to assist some 
full-lime and some part- 
time students. Presently

Mr. Bill Arnold, Director 
of Financial Aid has and 
Associate Degree in Pro- 
fe'sslonal Accounting from 
International Business 

College, a B.A. in Business 
from Saint Francis College 
and win complete a M,A. 
in Higher EducaticnatI~PU 
this coming Spring, He 
came to Purdue Univer- 
sity Extension at Fort 
Wayne in 1960, occupying a 
one-man business office. 



In June of 1971 Mr. Arnold ' 
became the Director of 
Financial Aid. 

Mr. Arnold Is married to 
the former Mary Lou 
Twigg, and is the father of 
four children; Pam and 
Mike, students at Elmhurst 
High School, Mitchell in 
sixth grade at Anthony 
Wayne, and Brenda in kin- 
dergarden at Anthony

less they feel the need for 
monies above and beyond 
that supplied by their in- 
come, thelrspouses in- 
come, and the GI Bill. 

The Federal Educational 
Opportunity Grant Is a de- 
finite gift-aid program. 
This is designed specific- 
ally for students who come 
from a family with a his- 
torical trend of low Income. 
Because of the Federalre- 
strlctlons this grant is gen- 
erally limited to dependent 
students because of parents 
confidential financial state- 
ment is needed in order to 
make a judgement of the ex- 
tent of historical trend of 
the family. 

Indiana Unl verslty al- 
so has a grant program 
which Is usually coupled 
with other aid. This is used 
provided there is grant mo- 
ney available. The monies 
for this grant are allocated 
through the Chancellor's 
office. 

Through Purdue Univer- 
sity fee exemptions maybe 
authorized; this being an- 
other form of a grant. 

Separate requests are 



made to the Feder"! Gov- 
ernment for the nursing 
loan and nursing grant 
funds. These funds of 
course are restricted to 
nurses. 

Because of the unusual 
situation at thiscampusthe 
financial aid office Is really 
two separate officesinone, 
being administered by one 
man under the jurisdiction 
of each parent university. 
To make financial aid more 
equitable to Che students at 
I-PU, the best thing that 
could happen would be the 
unification of the financial 
aid offices. As it stands 
right now, there are two 
separate and distinct forms 
for different students. 
Clearly, this cannot be to 
this office's or the stu- 
dents' best advantage to 
have to operate this way. 
If unification were imple- 
mented, the long-range im- 
plications are that there 
would be less staffing re- 
quired and the office most 
certainly would be able to 
minister to the needsofthe 
total student body ina more 
equitable form.

Capacity crowd 
listens to orchestra 



By Anita Lamos 



Last Sunday evening a 
capacity crowd was 
privileged to hear the first 
concert of the newly- 
formed I-PU Community 
Orchestra. From the 
moment Mr. David Jones 

perched his six-foot-plus 
frame atop the two-step 
podium to the end of the 
exciting Allegro con brio 
of the 'Overture toEgmont' 
It was an exciting evening 
'or everyone. For several 
members of the orchestra, 
this was their first ex- 
perience on this level. This 
was true of second vio- 
linists Bobby Smith, age 
10 and Butch Worman, age 
12. They attend Southern 
Heights and HUlcrest 
School, respectively. 

The program opened with 
"An Outdoor Overture" by 
Aaron Copland. Com- 
missioned * initially as an 
optomistic composition 
with youth-appeal, eMs 



proved to bf just that. It 
was bright, lively, and 
beautifully melodic. 

The Schubert 'Symphony 
No, 8 in B minor" ex- 
hibited some colorful con- 
trasts but seemed a bit 
too much like Brahms or 
Beethoven perhaps due the 
large French horn section 
of the orchestra. 

The closing selection. 
Overture to Egmont, Opus 
84 by Beethoven was a 
fitting climax to the in- 
teresting program. It 
certainly required much on 
the part of the youttiful 
members of the orchestra, 
but they certainly tried 
to be equal to it and carried 
on to the end. 

We congratulate Mr. Jones 
for putting together such 
varied levels of maturity 
and experience into such 
a fine-sounding orchestra. 
We are looking forv/ard to 
hearing more, soon. 



'The New Messiah not so new 

By Mike Snyder 



The New Messiah. Your 
reaction to this new release 
on the Columbia label might 
hinge^^Qri,j{our reaction to 
Handel s original. I always 
rather liked the original, 
although admittedly more 
so at Christmastime (there 
is something about the Hal- 
lelujah Chorus and Christ- 
mas trees together that 
strangely affects me.) 

Perhaps it is for that rea- 
son that I cannot rave about 
this new version adapted by 
Andy Belling. It is music- 
ally tight and well-arran- 
ged, but not nearly as pow- 
erful as the original as per- 
formed by. say, the New 
York Philharmonic with 
Leonard Bernstein. The 
singing is always adequate 
and often excellent, but at 
its very best only ap- 
proaches the vocalizing 
scored in the original. At 
many points in the work, 
one might think that he was 
listening to a version of the 
original with a percussion 
track added. 

Except for featured solo- 
ist Jimmy Walker's vocals 
on "The Trumpet Shall 
Sound," the entire album 
seems to be primarily an 
up-beat musical track io 
the original 1741 vocal 
score. Perhaps that is just 
what you've been waiting 
for all these years, but I 
think not. It appears to be 
another in a series of works 
to capitalize on the publi- 
city and artistic acceptance 
of Jesus Christ Superstar, 
that phenomenon of two 
years ago. The drumming 
in The New Messiah sounds 
almost identical to that of 
Superstar but there there- 
semblance ends. Jesus 
Christ, Superstar was new 
music, new words, a new 
■perspecrtve; TheNew Mes- 



siah either changed too lit- 
tle or too much. Had they 
changed less, Andy Belling 
et. al could have called it 
simply The Messiah. Un- 
fortunately, they didn't 
change it enough to merit 
the adjective "new", 
either. 

The ironic thing about The 
New Messiah is that Mr, 
Belling spent months re- 
arranging portions of Han- 
del's masterpiece to come 
up with a half-hour of ra- 
ther un-exciting music. It 
took George Handel three 
weeks to write the entire 
original work.

NOTHING 

BUT A MAN 

Shown Today 

"Nothing But a Man," the 
moving drama of the per- 
sonal struggle of a South- 
ern Negro and his wife in 
a society hostile to them, 
will be shown today on 
campus. 

Showings in either Room 
107 or the Recital Hall of 
the Academic Building will 
be at 3:30, 5:30 and 8:10 
p.m. and are part of a 
film series sponsored this 
year by the Students' 
Government. Admission is 
free to campus activity 
card holders and $1 per 
person to the public. 

Ivan Dixon and Abbey 
Lincoln have the leading 
roles in this movie made 
by independent film makers 
Michael Roemer and 
Robert Young, who have re- 
ceived international re- 
cognition. 

The story concerns a 
young railway worker, who 
gives up a good job to 
settle down and marry the 
preacher's daughter, a 
schoolteacher. His 
emotional ajustment to 
the problems of earning 
a living and supporting a 
family, of living in peace 
and dignity, becomes 
poignantly difficult be- 
cause the place is Alabama 
today and the man will not 
play the expected Negro 
role.

PIT'S ' 'Rosmersholm' 
unique, exciting 

By Sue Perrine 



;hi Papers j

essiah | 



A play by Henrik Ibsen, 
"Rosmersholm," is now 
being performed by PIT. 
This weekend marks the 
final performances of this 
quite exciting play. 

"Rosmersholm" is a 
unique play which could be 
considered very contra- 
versial. It is a story of 
a man trying to decide 
which side, politically, he 
wishes to support. This 
man is John Rosmer, His 
choice la to affect all, 
for he Is a respected man 
in his community. On his 
decision is based their 
friendship. His choice is 
not entirely his own 
though. John Rosmer. 
through the course of the 
play, is influenced by many 
different people. During 
this time is when ques- 
tions arise as to how this 
man should live his life. 
The final decision that 
John Rosmer makes is a 
sumbol of a free man going 
through life only as a man 
ought to; making his own 
decisions and living his 
own life. 

The part of John Rosmer 
Is played by Lee Stang- 
land. John Rosmer is a 
confused man trying to gain 
contentment wltfiln him- 
self. His part Is difficult, 
but Lee Stangland handles 
It well, 

Sharon Gatob plays the 
part of Rebecca West, 
Rebecca West Is the 
"good dear friend' o f 
John Rosmer, Miss West 
is an emotional woman 
whose part requires much 
work. It has to be the most 
. dlfflcylt. .rolP- iP. tbe play, _ 



The pan of Rebecca West 
is not the leading role, 
but It is by far the most 
exciting. Sharon Cabot 
portrays this mysterious 
woman with fantastic 
ability. 

Mr. Kroll Is the good 
friend of John Rosmer. His 
part is played by Dale 
Ware. Mr. Kroll is always 
furious about something. 
He is forever finding faults 
in someone and becoming 
enraged about it. The tem- 
per of Mr. Kroll Is port- 
rayed well by Dale Ware. 

The housekeeper, Mrs. 
Helseth, played by Susan 
Glazebrook, is the prissy 
mediator of the play. She 
provides little tidbits 
necessary to the plot. And 
engenders humor for the 
audience with her finicky 
mannerisms. 

Ulrlc Brendall is the old 
friend who is now poor and 
in need of assistance. 
Richard Knecht plays the 
part of this overbearing 
radical In a quite humorous 
way. 

Jeff Gibson Is Peter 
Mortensgaard. Jeff Gibson 
is only on stage for a 
brief time, but even so, 
he does and excellent job 
of portraying Peter 
Mortensgaard. Mr, Mor- 
tensgaard Is a newspaper 
man who helps reveal John 
Rosmer past to the audi- 
ence. 

Directed by Daniel Cash- 
man, the play "Rosmer- 
sholm" has turned out to 
be an excellent perforance. 
It provides humor, excite- 
ment, and thought for the 
. ItPU audience.

Everything you never really wanted 
to know about Roller Derby 



by Dave Seiy 



It has been termed as 
the "fastest growing spon 
In America.' The Roller 
Derby has captured the at- 
tention of the television 
sports fans in over 75 

cities on a special Roller 
Derby network throughout 
the country. Fort Wayne 
happens to be one of those 
elite. Although many peo- 
ple have questioned the 
legitimacy of the Derby, 
few have ever followed up 
their doubts. The Roller 
Derby is just a way of 
life and this a composite 
of the lifestyle which a few 
ambitious skaters have 
chosen to follow. 

To begin with, the Derby 
Is managed by young 
suburban dwelling execu- 
tives who understand tele- 
vision and urban de- 
mography and how to mani- 
pulate the realities of the 
times. The players them- 
selves, like Clyde Beaty's 
elephants, construct and 
dismantle their track and 
carry It along to the next 
town. It is a game played 
by kids who come right out 
of high school or the farm 
or off the assemble llne- 
the way they used to In 
all other sports before 
everyone started going to 
junior college. 

The heart of the Roller 
Derby Is the San Francisco 
Bay Area Bombers team. 
It is the home team for 
most every Derby fan in 
America. From early April 
through mid September the 
Sunday night Bombers' 
games are video-taped at 
Kezar Pavilion and are sent 
out to 79 stations all over 
the U.S. (and Japan) which 
schedule the tapes at their 
own convlence. 

One-half the Roller Derby 
Is still a woman's con- 
test. The audiences they 
play to are predominantly 
female. The Bombers op- 
ponents, "the visitors,' are 
usually called the Pioneers 
or the Cardinals. Many 
times, too, the opposition 
is simply billed as the All- 
Stars. Occasionally the 
All - Stars will even go 
under another name; they 
were the New England 
Braves, for example, when 
the tour hit Providence and 
Boston. They are the Mid- 
west Pioneers when they 
play In this area. It doesn't 
matter. Everyone still 
roots for the Bombers. 

The Bombers and the All- 
Stars tour to those cities 
that feature them on tele- 
vision. They're used to 
travelling more than 
15.000 miles with 13 car- 
loads of skaters and one 
semitrailer that carries 
the track and is usually 
driven by Jimmy Piere, 
a teamster who also dou- 
bles as one of the referees, 
touring schedule 
makes no sense. It winds 
and goes back and forth, 
up and down, here, over 



there and then winds back 
again. Charlie O'Connell, 
the greatest male star In 
the game, who Is always 
billed as "Bomber Great, 
Charlie O'Connell," says 
that Jerry Seltzer, the 
Roller Derby president, 
plans the trips by throw- 
ing darts at a map. "Blind 
folded, over his shoulder.' 
adds O'Connell. 

On a typical performance, 
the Bombers would move 
into their locker room at 
halftime, exhausted and 
disgusted. Everybody 

would go for a cigarette 
first thing. Nearly every- 
one on the Derby smokes 
a lot. The jhlghlights of 
the tour would be the dis- 
covery that cigarettes went 
for 250 a pack in cigar- 
ette machines in North 
Carolina. 

"How can you skate be- 
fore so few people?" Julian 
Silva would ask, 

"And all sitting on their 
hands,' would come the 
bedraggled reply. 

Everybody takes another 
drag. "Can't we all just 
chip In a dollar each and 
pay them to go home?" 
Silva asked. 

As halftime nears an end, 
everybody puts down their 
cigarettes and reaches for 
a comb. Interestingly 
enough, besides smoking, 
the thing that distinguishes 
a skater, male or female, 
is a continuing Interest in 
maintaining a neat and well- 
designed head of hair. 

Back on the track after 
the break, there are not 
enough real fights growing 
naturally out of the action, 
so when things drag, "fiery" 
Ann Calvello invariably 
gets a little skirmish going 
between jams. It Is a trans- 
parent facade, but for a 
large portion of the 
audience, the phony 
theatrics are more enter- 
taining than the sport. 

There is much more vio- 
lence, real and contrived, 
than what passes for 
comedy because it is quite 
obvious that this appeals 
most to the fans. "Fans 
at any age, I don't care 
what It Is, they want to 
see blood,' Calvello says. 
"They want to see us 
broken up and my body 
carried out. They want to 
see ttiat. Oh, we've had 
some vicious skaters, too. 
There are still some 
around, people so mean 
you'd hang'em by a good 
rope, they'd still complain. 
But they're rare. I could 
never hurt anyone deliber- 
ately," 

"Sure I have a fear of 
getting hurt,' Joanle Wes- 
ton says. "All I want out 
of Roller Derby is to make 
good money, get out of it 
in one piece, and years 
from now. when I say I 
was in the Roller Derby, 
I want people to still know 
what it is. I want that." 



So they are all, as veteran 
skater Larry Smith says, 
schizophrenic, like the 
game Itself, torn between 
the oldtlme clowning and 
the display of speed and 
muscle that marks real 
sport. The Derby can be- 
come so violent that there 
are unwritten laws about 
what should not be toler- 
ated. The experienced 
know, for Instance, how 
easy It Is to trip an op- 
ponent, undetected, and 
knock him flat out. A 

practiced hip can be more 



lethal than the more overt 
forearm smash. The girls 
know how to use an elbow 
to force the zipper of an 
opponents blouse down 
hard, digging it into her 
breasts. A simple poke to 
the bosom or a hairpulllng 
Is mor mundane but It is 
also a rare form of re- 
venge. 

A question among specta- 
tors is why skaters are not 
seriously hurt. After all, 
they are seldom in the best 
condition and they only 
wear knee and elbow pads 
for protection. Ankles are 
not bound and the high 

skate shoes are usually 
not laced at the top as 
that would restrict move- 
ment. The answer lies in 
their reslllenceandintheir 
training, during which, like 
in a course in judo, the 
learn how to fall properly. 
"Hey, remember The 
Mummy?" Charlie 



O'Connell asked one night 
in the locker room. "The 
guy wrapped himself here 
and here, and I swear to 
God, even across the rear. 
Afterward, we're all out of 
the shower getting dressed 
and he's still untangling 
himself." 

The Roller Derby Is real. 
It's contestants are also 
very real, brulsable, 
breakable human being 
breakable human beings 
who don't enjoy getting hurt 
or making others hurt any 
more than anyone else 
would. And even as con- 
testants file Into the lock- 
er rooms, the two teams 
sharing facilities, the men 
in one and the women In 
the other, there are very 
few incidents. "What's it 
going to prove to get all 
busted up In the locker 
room? You don't get paid 
for that."

Wehrmeister 

forecasts fine 
14-11 season 

by Steve Butcher 

g^ Mf » - m^ - In only its third year of 

i\onfiet s DOW to L/flvro/i,^°'"p«"*o" ^^e i-pubas. 

' 'ketball team has compiled 

a 4 and 6 record so far this 
season. Back from a ten 
game road trip, the Masto- 
dons will see action in the 
team's home-opener this 
Saturday against highly- 
touted I-PU of Indianapolis. 
George Wehrmeister is 
the head coach this year. 
He with the aid of assistant 
coach Gene Hany, holds 
practice for the tioys each 
night at the old Central 
gymnasium. Coach Wehr- 
meister states that he en- 
joys working with young 
people and derives great 
pleasure In helping them 
mold themselves into a so- 
lid team. 

The probable starters for 
this Saturday's game will 
be Don Chaney at center, 
Gary Trump and Mike Rich 
at Guard, and Tom Berning 
at forward. The other for- 
ward spot is shared by Rex 
Putt, Steve Yahn, and Bruce 
Haines, The tall Mastodons 
are lead by capable center 
Don Chaney. Chaney, who 
displays both good Inside 
moves and strong rebound- 
ing, averages over 20 points 
a game. He lead the Masto- 
dons with 21 points in their 
102-6B rout of Concordia 
Senior College. The other 
starters fo a fine job also. 
Coach Wehrmeister says 
that we have a taller team 
this year and that hopefully 
this season we will achieve 
a winning record of 14 and 



The K's are at It again 
by losing a home gamef 
They, continue their home 
Ice losing jinx by bowing 
to the Dayton Gems last 
Saturday night and the fol- 
lowing night recovering on 
the road against the Col- 
umbus Seals with a 7-1 
victory. The Komets show 
a great difficulty in per- 
forming for the home crowd 
for three full periods of 
professional hockey. 

Although the largest 
crowd thus far this season 
was on hand for the Dayton 
game and gave unending 
support to the K's, the Ko- 
mets fell flat on their heels 
In the last two periods of 
play. Dayton was checked 
heavily in the first period 
as the K's showed total 
control in the opening of 
the game. 

The recovery of the K's 
on Sunday could have been 
expected but not by such 
a large margin. The Kom- 
ets had seven different 
players score a goal. Cur- 
rently among them was the 
K's hottest stick handler. 
Dean Sheremeta, As a 
rookie left winger, Shere- 
meta has scored a goal in 
each of the last six games. 
This feat is comparable to 
a baseball player being able 
to maintain a batting av- 
erage of .350 or better. 

The defeat Saturday 
marked the first lost for 
the K's rookie goalie, Don 

Atchison. Atchison has a 
record of 7-1-0 and vet- 
eran Robbie Irons has a 
8-19-0 record. The goal- 
es show goal against aver- 
age 2.21 and 3.15 respec- 
tively. The K's goal tend- 
ing Is presently the best 
In the IHL with the least 



by Leo Herendeen 

goal scored against. 79, 
The continual break down 
of the defense has been a 
major set back for the 
Komets, however. 

The way to victory In 
most sports is the num- 
ber of points scored and 
the K's will have to come 
alive in the next few weeks 
to be able to catch the di- 
vision leading Dayton Gems 
as the season reaches the 
halfway mark later this 
month. Wayne Ego contin- 
ues to lead the K's In scor- 
ing with Chic Balon trail- 
ing hy eight points. How- 
ever, a surprise for this 
year's Bob Pitcher over 
his last year's perform- 
ance as he has scored 18 
points so far this season 
and scored 17 points In all 
last season. The Komets 
scoring will hopefully in- 
crease in their more crit- 
ical games If they are to 
catch any place in the play- 
offs. 

The next home games are: 
Dec. 9-Sat.-Columbus 
Dec. 16-Sat,-Saginaw 
Dec. 2 2 -Sat. -Dayton 
Dec. 25-Mon.-Toledo 
Dec. 27-Wed.-Port Huron

Dec. 30-Sat,-Flint 
Dec. 31-Sun,-Des Moines 

All games start at 8 p.m. 
at the Memorial Coliseum 
except the Dec. 27 game.

Cagers to play first 
home game Saturday 



The Indiana -Purdue bas- 
ketball team will play Its 
first home game at Cen- 
tral's gym this Saturday 
at 2 p.m. The Mastodons 
will play host to Indiana- 
Purdue -Indianapolis, and 
from my poln t of view, 
I foresee an exciting game 
with the Fort Wayne team 
finishing ahead by ten 
points. 

I know that there are a 
lot of people who will read 
this article who will not go 
to the game. So I'll tell 
you what you're going to 
miss. 

You won't get to see Don 
Glianeyl When Don gets 
the ball under the basket 
you can bet that the next 
place the ball will go Is 
through the hoop. Don 
isn't particular about how 
me makes his points. He'll 
put the ball In the basket 
by using his right hand, 
left hand, over handed, un- 
der handed, backwards, 
forewards, sideways, and 
with or without his glasses. 
When Don isn't busy making 
baskets on offense, he's 
blocking opponents' shots 
on defense just as though 
he were swatting flies. 

You won't get the privi- 
lege of watching Gary 
Trump bring the ball down 
the court to the attack, 
Gary's got to be the best 
guard Indiana-Purdue has 
ever hadl He's not only 
the playmaker but is also 
one of the leading rebound- 
ers on the team, which 
shows that he's alwayS' in 
there where the action Is. 

You won't get to see Tom 
Berning. Tom doesn't look 
like a basketball player, 
but he scores lots of points, 
plays excellent defense, 
and is a strong retwunder. 
No, Tom doesn't look like 
a basketball player - un- 
til you see him play. 

You won't get to see Mike 
Rich, the guard who almost 
didn't get to play because 
he didn't want to shave. 
But he has shaved, and he's 



by Paul Jacquay 

playing. No one can spot 
an open man and get the 
ball to him like Mike can. 

Rex Putt will be dealing 
on his defensive man, and 
Rex is a smooth dealer 
from underneath, but you 
won't get to see him. 

Steve Yahn and Keith 
Woebbeking can both dunk 
the ball behind their backs. 
Bruce Halne's jump shot 
is much more pleasing to 
watch than anything Rick 
Mount ever attempted. But 
you won't get to see them. 

The Mastodons' bench 
strength Is so fantastic that 
they racked up 46 points 
against Concordia, but you 
won't get to see them. 

You won't get to see the 
seven gracious cheerlead- 
ers as they tell Indiana- 
polis that "we're goona get 
you[" 

There's only one way you 
can get to see this team 
which has won four of its 
last six games. Be at 
Central High School gym at 
2 p.m., Saturday, Decem- 
ber 9,

11. The rest oi the team 
includes Denny Blanken- 
becker, Terry Gach, Kent 
Rosenberry, Bob Spice, and 
Keith Woebbeking. 

So farthls season the team 
has had very little student 
support. At some of the 
games there were as little 
as 10 spectators for the 
home club. No one reason 
can be pinpointed for this, 
but its very disappointing 
for the team and even more 
disappointing for the cheer- 
leaders. The game this Sat- 
urday will be played at the 
Central gymnasium at 2:00 
with the preceeding J.V. 
game at 12:00, Both games 
promise to be real barn- 
burners, so come on outl

Ode to an ashtray 



Before I was an ashtray 
My life was dull and grey 
I used to be a split pea can 
To pass my time away 
But now I've flattened out 

a bit 
And yet I'm kind of bumpy 
I guess it must be puberty 
That makes me seem so

And people now look down

They've really got some

The mirrors and doors get

And I get all the ...
