Coacti Tony 

Dungy, 

Coaching Fort 

Wayne youth to 

be uncommon

"TIlis is my passion," said Tony Dungy in Fort 
Wayne, two weeks after retiring as coach of the India- 
napolis Coits. Dungy, the first-ever African-American 
coach to win the Super Bowl in 2007, was not talking 
about rootbaJl. he was talking about working with 
today's youth. 

Dungy spent all day February 4 at North Side High 
school. 

Dungy spoke not once, but tivice, and not at a foot- 
ball field; it was the basketball gymnasium. He spoke 
to Fort WajTie high school freshmen from North Side. 
South Side, Snider, Elmhurst, Northrop, and Wayne. 

Dung&gt;' wasn't coaching Football but high school 
freshmen on living life and living it by being "uncom- 
mon." Uncommon is the tide of Dungy's new book. 

Wlien Dungy retired as coach of the Colts two 
weeks earlier, he said, "Don't shed any tears for me. I 
got to live a dream most people don't get to live," 

Dung&gt;' retired on January 17, then prepared for 
being a Super Bowl TV sports analyst on February' 1, 
which he said "was a lot more work than I expected," 
and llien hit the road promoting his new book and 
giving motivadonal speeches to youth. 

Dungy is the Colts' leader in victories. He went 
85-27 in the regular season and 7-6 in the playoffs, 
including a victor)' over the Chicago Bears in Super 
Bowl XLI. 

His new book Uncommon is about people step- 
ping outside being average, setting goals and selling 
them high, and not letting anyone say you can't do 

He stressed, "You need to be willing to work for 



He said his 2007 Indianapolis Colts football team 
won the Super Bowl because, "They refused to be 
just average." 

He talked about race not being a barrier and that 
President Barack Obama showed that (o the entire 
world. He talked about one's gender not being an 
obstacle and that Secretary of Stale Hillary Clinton 
showed that to the entire world. 

He said that Rod Woodson, a Snider high school 
alumni, was another example of being "uncommon." 
Wijodson is the former defensive back for the Pitts- 
burgh Sieelers, Baltimore Ravens, San Francisco 
■l^iors and Oakland Raiders, and recent inductee into 
the i'ro Football Hall of Fame. 

Coach Dungy talked and walked the gymnasium 
taking questions from the appreciative and enthu- 
siastic high schoolers. He answered that he lives in 
Tampa Bay as "my home base," and also spends time 
in Indianapolis and around the slate to work with 
youth. 

He explained his favorite player was Warrick 
Dunn, running back from the Tampa Bay Bucca- 
neers, because he was undersized and became a star 
"the hard way." He said Dunn was an example of liv- 
ing life by being uncommon and that anyone can do 
anything in life today if "willing to work for it." 

When asked about his five-year game plan, he 
said it would be working with youth in Indianapolis 
and elsewhere, but not coaching pro football. The 
retired Dungy said, "and yes I will be back to Fort 
Wayne too."

Additional security needed to keep all areas of Walb open to students 



-i^ 



By KodyTinnel 

siupieseiplw.edu 



As most Students 
know the RemnantTrust 
is occupying the area of 
Helmke Library for the 
remainder of the spring 
semester. This area in 
the past has generally 
been known as the 24- 
hour computer lab on 
the IPFW campus. 



Student Body 
Presidential Address 



Because of tliis, the 
WaJb Student Union lab 
has become the new all- 
hours student study spot. 
For most students this is a 
nice change. The Walb lab 
has a lot more computers 
available and also offers a 
cozier atmosphere. 

Although the lab in Walb 
is open 24 hours, the rest 
of the building is not. Stu- 
dents might notice signs 
'staling that anyone in the 
building afterhours will be 
asked to leave unless they 



are in the lab. I strongly 
believe that all areas of 
our Union, except the 
offices, should be open 
all hours to fit students' 
oftentimes hectic sched- 
ules. 

1 brought forth this is- 
sue last Thursday at 
the Chancellor's Chat. 
Chancellor Michael War- 
telt stated that the Union 
could be open 24 hours 
but IPFW would have to 
pay for additional secu- 
rity 10 make sure all ar- 



eas are safe for students 
to be in and no shenani- 
gans are taking place. 

This spring when the 
IPSGA Allocations Com- 
mittee meets to form the 
recommended IPSGA 
budget for the coming 
fiscal year 1 will be re- 
questing that money be 
set aside to pay for 24 
hour security of Walb so 
that our Student Union 
can be open ail day ev- 
eryday. 

We have about 12,000 



students at IPFW so there 
is no reason we shouldn't 
have at least one build- 
ing open all the time for 
studying or socializing. 

On a somewhat related 
note, if anyone has opin- 
ions on how to redeco- 
rate and refurnish the 
Ufiion please contact 
me. I want to get a lot 
of feedback and hope- 
fully Stan making Walb a 
more comfortable place 
for years to come.

In this installment, 
we will give you the lop 
two mistakes of poor in- 
vesting. While investing 
can yield high rewards, 
people commonly forget 
to have some fun iviih 
their money. There are 
so many responsibilities 



for us to consider as stu- 
dents, and we can gel 
very weighed down by 
them. To help counter 
this, you need to factor 
in some fiin. Do what 
makes you happy now 
that you are beginning 
to think money-smart.

take you can make in

The 'Top Five' 

Valentine's Day Horror Films 



By Kelly McLendon 

k el I y. m ele n do tie rpfwco m m 1 



Valentine's Day is as much about 
death and dying as it is about getting 
cheap Russell Stover chocolates and 
overpriced grocery store roses that 
sell for $18 a dozen. This year, the 
day falls directly after Friday the i3'^ 
which only points to oneexcellent way 
to celebrate the holiday: by watching 
Valentine's- inspired horror fliclts. 
While the day is about happiness and 
love, these movies prove some pretty 
evil stuff can happen amid all the 
celebration. 

Top Five Valentine's Day Horror Films (in 
no particular order): 

1. My Bloody Valentine (2009). 
It's about a February 14 massacre that 
claimed the lives of nearly two dozen 
people, all because of a mistake in a 
coal mine. 

Logically, what happens in the 
movie could happen in real life; a 
person who was supposedly killed 
comesbacktolifeandseeksvengeance 
on those he thought harmed him. 
Hey, it could happen. Somewhere, 
maybe. 

2. Valenrine (2001). The 
interesting part of the story begins 
when a group of friends get Valentine's 
Day cards that point to Impending 
death. They don'l know wJio sent the 
cards, but the friends do know that 
the sender is about to get revenge. 
The story line is believable, but takes 
the situation too far. 

Sure, we all have people who hate 
us and would like to send us cards 
that tell us how we totally messed up 



their lives, but do they really want us 
dead most of the time? No. Valentine 
is, however, a decent example of what 
can happen if you treat people poorly: 
they will send you a card threatening 
to kill you and you might just die. Or 
you might not. Who knows. 

3. Hospital Massacre (1982). 
The most unbelievable of them all. A 
former psychiatric hospital patient 
grows up and returns back to loivn 
and dresses up in a doctor's uniform. 
He then proceeds to Idll some of the 
hospital staff, while keeping a nurse 
who took care of him when he was 
young in his watch. It's unbelievable 
because it's highly unlikely. You 
will never hear of a story like this 
happening. Not even on Fox News. 
But the killer should get effort points 
for disguising himself as a doctor 

4. Lovers Lane (1999). Seriously, 
how many times do they have to make 
a movie about two people who park 
out in the middle of nowhere and 
then are rudely interrupted by a man 
with a hook hand who always kills the 
conceited boyfriend first? And why 
does there seem to be an actual street 
called Lovers Lane in most towns? 
What's up with that? 

5. Friday the 13'" (2009). So, 
this is technically not a traditional 
Valentine's Day movie; and the 
whole Friday the 13'^ lason series has 
spiraled out of control. There are so 
many renditions of this story that it's 
often di£licult to tell them apart. This 
new version hits theaters February 13 
and while everyone knows the story 
of Jason, it might still be interesting. 
Plus, it has actor lared Padalecki in it, 
which is a definite added bonus.

Roommate's Pick: 

Copeland 



By Mark Cox 

FTiariLcoiQiphvcorainunicalDrorg 

Copeland was origi- 
nally formed in 2000 by 
Aaron Marsh and his 
t\vo friends in Lakeland. 
Florida. They consist of 
guitar, piano, drums and 
bass and give a unique 
sound to the pop and 
alternative genres and 
produce a calm aura. In 
2002, they signed a re- 
cord deal wnth The Mi- 
litia Group and released 
Beneath MedicineTteea 
year after. Their second 
album. In Motion, was 
released in March 2005 
and isn't as known as 
their other albums. 

In luly 2007, bassist 
lames Likeness made 
a public decision to no 
longer be affiliated with 
Copeland and went on 
to pursue his career as 
a graphic designer. This 
led the band to announce 
they have split ways with 
Columbia Records after 
ilieir third full length 
album. Copeland was 
thought to be done for as 
a group, but about a year 
after the split released a 



B-side album along with 
some new songs and by 
iatc 2008 released their 
most current EP You Are 
My Sunshine. , 

Marsh has contrlbut- [ 
ed his time and vocals to 
Bittersweet Symphony, a 
benefit \'H1 did for the ,

A wide range of singers 
from bands contributed 
to the project; 100 per- |

dozens more, have been 
espousing their geekliood 
on late-night talk shows 
and in interviews over the 
past few years. The in- 
credible popularity of the 
neweditionsof D&amp;D, and 
creative marketing that 
has reached out to col- 
lege students and popular 
media figures, has seen 
the game's popularity ex- 
plode. You can't go into a 
Barnes &amp; Noble without 
stumbling over a big rack 
of DSiD books and boxes 
of miniatures, other role- 
playing games have their 
own aisle. 

The newest edition of 
D&amp;D has been designed 
as a modern game tliat's 
easy to pick up for new 
players and computer 
gamers who want to give 
the real thing a shot. 

"The game mechan- 
ics have been amped up 
to. ..make play faster and 
more exciting," Bill Slav- 
iscek said in an article on 
the D&amp;D website. 

On Super Bowl week- 
end, the full D&amp;D experi- 
ence was on display at the 
Grand Wayne Center at a 
convention called D&amp;D 
Experience. Everything 
from D&amp;D Miniatures to 
the "hack-em-up" style 
Delve to the D&amp;D-themed 
card game. Three Dragon 
Ante, could be found. To 
support the lifestyle, ven- 
dors sold crates full of 
dice, clothing and acces- 
sories. 

The main even though, 
was the opportunity to 
play In four days' worth of 
the worldwide campaign 
knoivn as Living Forgot- 
ten Realms (LFR). Players 
from as far as Australia 
came to test their mettle 
in Uiese adventures and 
to gain valuable abilities 
that they can use in LFR 
games anywhere in the 



'orld. 
Living . 



Realms is run by the RPGA 
(Role-Playing Gamers As- 
sociation), which tracks 
players and their charac- 
ters through the persis- 
tent game world. 

"The players and judg- 
es here are the dedicated 
core of our member- 
ship," said Dave Rayman, 
a long-time RPGA mem- 
ber who organizes D&amp;D 
Experience. "They 
here every year then take 
the modules and infor- 
mation back to their lo- 
cal stores, where they run 
LFR games year-round." 

There's quite a bit of 
information to he had 
at D&amp;D Experience, too. 
Wizards of the Coast, the 
company that publish- 
es D&amp;D, sent five of the 
game's designers to the 
show to host seminars, 
run games, and mingle 
with their biggest fans. At- 
tendees could hear about 
upcoming releases, get 
advice on different as- 
pects of the game, and 
just talk shop with 
of the industry's most fa- 
mous names. 

"The economy's tough 
for everyone," says Bart 
Carroll of Wizards of the 
Coast." And D&amp;D pro- 
vides great value. The 
Starter Set is under $20 
and has everything you 
need to play. Our website 
[www.wizards.com/dnd) 
has even more free ad- 
ventures and digital tools 
to help you get started," 

If you're interested in 
checking out an RPGA 
game in Fort Wayne, head 
over to htlp://www.wiz- 
ards.com/rpga and take 
a look at the local 
calendar. 

"We know they'll be

said Rayman. "It's an

By Said El-Dajani 

'The Pink Panther 2' 
was a rather dull Fam- 
ily film, a salad ivith too 
much dressing and little 
texture. 

in this sequel of a re- 
make, the writers tr\' and 
explore Steve Martin's 
characier, the mumble 
bumbling, Inspector 

lacque Clouseau, All ihe 
while a cheap plot un- 
folds, as a super detective 
team, comprised of once 
respected actors, try and 
slop a globetrotting thief, 
'The Tornado.' 

A social worker is 
around to constandy cor- 
rect Cousieau's ignorant 



child-like behaxior, a 
weak attempt at pointing 
out real stereotypes, so- 
cial faux pas, and sexual 
harassment. 

While a renovated 
Pink Panther film would 
be nothing without a 
love story, Martin at best 
shows us that love can be 
of all things, extremely 
awkward. 

Clouseau's signature 
punch line, 'hamburger' 
was reintroduced in this 
epic failure. With its nov- 
elty gone, even Martin's 
accent had lost its luster. 
The only dimension to his 
character he had down 
pat seemed over practiced 
and overboard. 

Though I laughed and 



hid my face in my mom's 
shoulders in embarrass- 
ment, at least there was 
one good kick in the face, 
and an essential bul- 
let ricochet that got the 
wrong guy. Classic? Check 
please.

In her mind's eye, Ihe 
images converge; purple 
lace and satin stitched 
together by dark thread. 
Rendering her vision on 
to a sheet of paper, the 
design for the lead's dress 
is complete. 

Kathryn Wimer is a ju- 
nior theatre major, with 
an emphasis in make-up 
and costume design. "My 
dream job would be to 
one day work for Cirque 
Du Soleil, just because 
a lot of their stuff is very 
abstract." Wimer also 
mentioned an interest in 
designing puppets for the 
lim Henson Company. 

When Wimer began 
her college career, she 
knew she wanted to be 
ilicairc major, but she 
didn't know which of the 
ihrt'e concentrations she 
wanted to focus in. The 
one thing she did know 
wiis thai she didn't want 
to be an actress. [Wimer 
ultimately chose to focus 
on make-up and costume 
design because of her long 
history in drawing and 
visual arts. She wanted 
to add elements of draw- 
ing into her career.l "I'm 
mystified by theatre de- 
sign because the pictures 
1 draw can become a real 
life costume or character." 
She went on to describe 
how costume and make- 
up are intricately parts of 
a character's design. 

During her sophomore 



year, Wimer "burned out" 
out on the theatre depart- 
ment, when at one point 
she was slage-nianaging 
Wailing for Godot and 
helped with lighting de- 
sign for Purely Dance. 

"Stage-managing 
scared me away from 
the theatre department," 
Wimer said. Getting back 
to her roots Wimer chose 
to become a fine aris ma- 
jor. 

That wasn't the end of 
the stor&gt;' for Wimer, who 
like the prodigal child 
returned home. After a 
semester away, Wimer re- 
turned 10 the Theatre de- 
partment. Wimer missed 
the cooperative effort. "In 
theatre you have to rely 
on other people to get the 
show together" 

Wimer hasn't had 
any of her work become 
"real-life" characters yet, 
but next year is her se- 
nior year and for her se- 
nior project she will most 
likely be doing costume 
design for a show. Which 
show and when has yet 
to be decided yet. But for 
now, Wimer is working 
hard in the costume shop, 
as well as developing her 
character for her acting 
role in the upcoming The 
Taming of the Shrew.

ART 

AND THE 

CITY 

8 tips on how to act at an opening 

By Kelly McLendon 



Art is for everyone. It's for the girt with an armfiil of 
tattoos and pink hair, as well as for the sophisticated guy 
who wears a tie with his super-cool 80s checkered sweaters. 
Most importantly, it's for the average college student, who 
are just looking for something interesting to see. 

Take the Art Off Main event last Friday. [l was well at- 
tended by The Communicaior staffers, as well as dozens of 
IPFW students, some who were even in the Fashion Show. 

An is becoming a big deal in Fort Wayne, regardless if 
the masses have noticed the small changes. There's more lo 
do, more lo see on Friday and Saturday nights than in the 
past. That expansion and the rise of little galleries, is going 
to bring more fun events local. 

If you've never been to the opening reception of an art 
event, you should go. Going lo ihe An Off Main opening re- 
ception showed that art draws out everyone. There are many 
types of people who show up for shows like that, not jusi 
avid artists anddcsigners.TypicaI.everyday people can find 
enjoymenl in going to Fort Wayne art shows. 



A few tips on how to act at an 
opening reception: 

1 . Don't stand in one place the whole evening. Take a cou- 
ple friends with you and move around the area, chat with 
some people you know (and some you don'l) and keeping 
moving. 

2. Check out the art while waiting for the main attraction 

3. If it makes you more comfortable, get a drink from Ihe 
bar. Even if you're just having Tup "on the rocks" you in- 
sianlly look a little cooler. 

4. Have fun! Opening receptions are about celebrating the 
artist and checking out his or her work. You're supposed lo 
have a good time. 

5. You can dress up if you want. Some people wear jeans, 
some people dress more formally. It doesn't matter what 
you wear, bul if you want lo make a statement with your 
clothing, this is ihe venue for it. 

6. Sign-up on the gallery or studio mailing list before you 
leave the event. Thai way, you'll stay informed about what's 
going on and when to expect the next show. 

7. Chai with the artists/designers. Some shows have a loca- 
tion set up where ihe community can ask the artist or de- 
signer questions during or after his or her show. Take advan- 
tage of this opportunity if you really enjoyed that person's 
artwork. 

8. If you're into fashion, lake note at what everyone else is 
wearing. You'll definitely see highly unique outfits and you 
might even be able to get some ideas. Sometimes, you'll get 
more ideas ai an art show, than in a fashion magazine like 
InStyle or Vogue. 

Follow these suggestions, create a few of your awn and 
you're well on your way to having an exciting and thrilling 
limcai an artshow or opening reception.

Hardly predictable, but 'Dons should be in 



In a league where anything can happen, it is hard 
lo tell what the rest of February' will hold on both the 
men's and women's sides of the Summit League. 

As it stands right now, IPFW's men are seventh 
in the standings, while the women are ninth in 
theirs. Only the top eight in the final regular season 
standingseamabirth in the conference tournaments. 
Ultimately, the winners of the tournament recieve an 
automatic bid to the NCAA Tournaments. 

Last season, getting in the top eight was not an 
issue for IPFW because only eight teams were eligible 
as newer Division I schools North Dakota State and 
South Dakota Slate were finishing up their NCAA 
self-certification process. 

Looking forward, the men have five games left, that 



they could win three or four of. Sweeping Southern 
Utah and UMKC in the final weekend at home is 
probable, as is at least one road win (likely at Western 
Illinois on Feb. 21). That said, a second road win at 
lUPUl or this weekend at Oakland could garner the 
men a seed as high as fourth. However, just an invite 
alone is highly likely. 

For the women, it's a tougher road, but luckily 
against lesser teams, 1 could see Chris Paul's team 
winning their final three against lUPUT. UMKC and 
Southern Utah, so they should finish with six or 
seven Summit League wins. It won't be pretty, but an 
eighth seed is possible. That final weekend game with 
Southern Utah could see the winner get the final spot 
in the lournameni.

event for breast cancer awareness. 

"This is a way for the university to 
provide communitj' awareness and 
provide kind of an outreach to the 
community," IPFW Athletic Director 
Tommy Bell said. 

The PinkOut event was 
conceptualised in 2007 when Bell came 
to IPFW and the Womens Basketball 
Coaches 
Association 
started the 

general concept 
of the event. 

IPFW was Ihe 
first to hold such 
an event in the 
Summit League 
in 2008 and held 
a second event ^^==^^^^^ 
in the fall with 

women's volleyball. Western Illinois, 
a fellow conference member, also held 
their PinkOut event this past Saturday. 

The proceeds from the ticket sales 
and silent auction, roughly $1,400, 
will be split betiveen the Northern 
Indiana Susam G. Komen for the Cure 
Foundation and the American Cancer 
Society. 

"We are pleased IPFW chose to 
support the idea of a PinkOut and 



"Last year when the women 
came up to me and said 'you 

don't know what its like to 

be on the floor and get a 

standing ovation from 2,000 

people.' That's powerful." 



The acknowledgement was great 
according the Fleck, who also helps 
organize the ACS's fall walk "Making 
Strides against Breast Cancer." That 
event drew participation from 5,000 
people this past fall. 

"The truth is, it's not a female 

disease, it's a family disease," Fleck 

said. "Weare so blessed with really good 

hearted students 

. at IPFW." 

Breast cancer, 
according 
the Fleck, is 
98 percent 

survivable, if 
detected early. 
However, fewer 
women are 

— getting routine 
mammograms 
she says. That has also triggered the 
ACS's "Tell a Friend" program to make 
sure the message gets out to women to 
get ycady mammograms, especially if 
over theageofilO. 

Willie thai messages is still getting 
told, the general message has been 
clear at IPFW's PinkOut events and 
according to Bell, has been a powerful 
one.

executive director for the American

"We are very fortunate to be able

Before the game, a video was shown 
featuring Kay Yow, the former North 
Carolina State womens coach who 

recently lost a near 20-year battle with 
breast cancer. A moment of silence for 
Yow was also held. 

"She really became like Jimmy 
Valvano did on the mens side, " Bell 
said, "We were just happy to do that 
because she has brought a lot to the 
womens basketball college game." 

Valvano, also a former NCSU 
coach, died in 1993 after a tenth month 
battle with bone cancer. Valvano's 
"V Foundation" has raised over $80 
million for cancer research. 

The game itself was an interesting 
battle for the Mastodons, who are 
struggling to obtain the eighth and 
final place in Ihe forlhcorning Summit 
League Tournament. 

After leading by as many as 17 
points, IPFW let the lead slip away, 
but still held ofl" Oral Roberts, 67-54. 
Chelsey Jackson was a perfect 10-for- 
10 from the free throw line on her way 
to a game high 1 9 points. 

Eva Ivanova added 16, while Jordan 
Zuppehad 12. 

But the real story Saturday was the 
positive visual of so many hard hghting 
breast cancer survivors.

One week after starting the MIVA off with a split, the 
men's volleyball team again started strong, but fell short 
Friday with a 3-0 loss to visiting Lewis, 

The first game went into volleyball overtime as IPFW 
fell 32-34 in the "first to 30' format. After trailing much of 
the first game, IPFW took the lead for the first time at 24- 
23 on a Lewis attack error. IPFW took their only two point 
lead of the game at 26-24 off a kill from Darryl Shank and a 
Nadianiel Berg/Ben Duckworth block, 

Lewis kept pace and each team had a crack at game 
point before Leivis rallied off kills from Drew Pickering and 
Alex Vigansk&gt;'. 

The second game saw IPFW take a 2-0 lead but go 
flat after the mentally tough game one loss. The Flyers 
countered the 2-0 slan to get four straight points off die 
Brian Muesenfechler serve. IPFW eventually dropped the 
second game 20-30. 

In the third, coach Amie Ball subbed most of his team 
and the bench went on a roil. Thougli they only led at 1-0 
and 2- 1 , IPFW held steady throughout the game, led by five 
kills from Ivan Matos. Lewis however, was too much and 
won 30-26. 

!PFW was led by 12 kills and seven digs from Shank, who 
also had five block assists. Lewis' Pickering led all players 
widi 19 kills. Nick Perekas had 12 digs for the Flyers. 

Lewis, the preseason MIVA favorite, is now 1-1 in 
conference play. IPFW is at home this weekend for two 
matches with new program, Grand Canyon.
