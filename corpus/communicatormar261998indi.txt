Univei^iiy poLcc were busy

According 10 IPFW Police and 
Safely Chief Uuren DenHaOog. 
itae seven bomb ihreaL^ that have 
occulted so far this semesier were

arrested on Dec 10 

Klotz was cbaigcd with two 
counts of false reporting and 
infonning in iwo of ihe more than 
20 bomb threats reported last 
semesier. 

If convicted. Klolz could face 
a minimum one-year sentence and 
a 510,000 fine. False reporting and 
informing is a Class D felony 

Campus police have also been 
following other leads in an effod

responsible for the threats. 

A S5.000 reward was estab- 
lished la^t fall 10 help catch the 
personts) responsible.

anyone has information thai leads 
10 the arrest and conviction of 
unrelated, separate suspecLs m the 
bomb threats, then there is a sepa-

Job search and 

Career Services; career direction 

just a visit away 



By Dodie Miller 

Chief Hepohter 



A college degree is an item 
many students envision in their 
lives four years after high school 

Many students are over- 
whehned by the choices they have 
concerning degrees and subsequent 
careers. 

That is where IPFW Career 
Services comes in to help 

According 10 Charles 
Washington, interim director of 
Career Services, a visit 10 the Career 
Services office should complete the 
collegiate cycle for students attend- 
ing IPFW. 

"Career Services is the begin- 
ning and the end point for siudcnis." 
he says. "When they come in, stu- 
dents take the placement tests and as 
they leave, ihey should [alsol Uike 
career testing." 

He suggests Ihal students visit 
Career Services by their junior year 

Placement Services is another 
Career Services offering. It provides 
a wide variety of means to help stu- 
dents reach their post-college goals 

Vicki Dandor Braun. assistant 
director for Placement Services. 
suggests that students who want to 
attend the orientation sessions held 
at the beginning of each semester 
make their intent known during die 
previous semester; scsMons fill up 



quickly 

Career Services sponsors sever- 
al "talks" dunng each semesier 

Business Talk has a panel from 
area businesses that discusses what 
they look for in potential employ- 
ees 

Straight Talk is designed for 
education majors to hear from area 
school corporation representatives. 
Straight Talk will be held this fall. 

The Job Search Strategy 
workshop and Resume Critique 
sessions gives students feedback on 
what could be done to improve 
resumes 

There is also an Interviewing 
Strategies workshop, in which p^- 
ticipants are videotaped and ihen 
are allowed 10 view themselves 
from the employers' point of view 

"That way they see how ibey 
come across," Qandor Braun said 

Washington describes Ihe 
Placement Services method of help- 
ing students as "a holistic 
approach " 

He feels that it is unportani for 
students to both present themselves 
well and interview well 

Although an education is 
imponani, the ultimate goal is a 
career Without proper preparation. 
many students have difficulty find- 
ing and aliainmg the position Ihcy 
want 

In addition to the many com- 
modities currently offered 10 IPFW 
students, another workshop entitled 
"21sl Century Career Strategies." 



will be held soon 

Bandor Braun is pleased 10 o^er 
the service "I'm real excited about 
it." she said. 

Bandor Braun has always 
worked in positions that enabled her 
to assist those looking for work. 

"In this arena, it allows me lo 
work with people (students) who 
have gotten a wonderful education," 
she said. "I help them realize what 
they can do with their education. 1 
make il easier for them to see how 
they can be successful. Il's very ful- 
filling." 

The "2151 Ceniury Career 
Strategies" teaches ihose who are 
going to be a part of Ihe work force 
of tomorrow, the rules of the work- 
place 

The Career Opportunity bul- 
letins that are posted around cam- 
pus are also a courtesy of Career 
Services 

The bulletin, published bi- 
monthly, presents a only fraction of 
positions available.

editorial note 

After receiving numerous phone 
calls from mothers, visits and let- 
ters from cheerleaders we've decid- 
ed lo to lake the high road and apol- 
ogize for the 3/19 staffed. 

The main reason for ibis is 
because we refuse lo be blamed. 
once again, for others' misfortune. 

We have been informed, by the 
cheerleaders, that they may not be 
able to to travel to OSU and 
Hawaii, due lo our article slating 
that they don't cheer Even ihough 
we arc being used as an excuse by 
Ihcir board (according to the cheer- 
leaders) not to let them go. we'll 
lake the role of scapegoat proudly. 

Our intention was never lo short- 
change the men and women of the 
cheer squads We were just making 
personal observations

To the Editor: 

My congraiulaiions to IX&gt;nnis 
Donahue for finally having the 
courage to stand up for men's 
rights. It is about lime that we 
exposed a lilile-known irtiih It's a 
woman's world. Always has 
been, always will be. 

Men may enjoy such inconse- 
quential luxuries as monopoly 
control of the world's financial. 
political and cultural instiluiions, 
but as Mr. Donahue pomts out. 
until women tee off a few yards 
farther from the green, we can't 
really expect gender equality. 

I'm just sorry that Mr. 
Donahue didn't have the courage 



to gel to the whole truUi- that it's 
really a black lesbian's world. 
Now there is a group that enjoys 
privilege 

Rnally though, someone like 
Mr Donahue has the conviction 
10 expose the history of the 
shameful ireannent while, hetero- 
sexual men have suffered, and 
continue to suffer, at the hands of 
the oppressive woman Perhaps 
now, though, we can begin lo con- 
stnici a more just society Well

Cheerleader defends 
spirit squads 



To tbe Editor 

I would like lo address tbe 
issue raised in an article titled 
"Rah, rah, sis boom bah" on 
Thurs., March 19, 1998. 1 felt this 
article did not truly capture what 
IPPA' cheerleading and dance 
squads are all about. As a two- 
year cheerleader for IPFW, I 
would like to point out some 
things that may not have been 
considered when this anicle was 
wniien 

First, wc are the ONLY team

we have goiien a third and first

squad jusi gained three new girls 
for the end of the season. They are 
preparing a routine for a competi- 
tion at the end of March, 

I Ihink IPFW should be 

cnihused to know that there are so 

many people wanting lo cheer for 

IPFW's athletic leants that we 

needed to have Ihrec separate 

squads. IPFW's spirit squads are 

not only growing in number, but 

the talent is surging as well We 

are making a name for ourselves. 

So why tan'i we get fans to stand 

up? Good question! 

We try doing

and get no response.

our coach is only

We run our own

see what IPFW cheerleading is all 
about Those abilities arc brought 
out 10 the games and I'm sorry for 
those who overlook thai Our tal- 
ent and cheerleading abilities are 
far too valuable lo be overlooked. 
We've actually gotten to ihe point 
where the players ask us if we are 
going to come lo the games and 
cheer for them As long as the

Police experiences: good and bad 



WHAT S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?: KATHRYN MEICH 



Recendy. I was talkmg wiih 
someofmyfnends about our expe- 
riences with the police. It was an 
interesting conversaLon. 

We mainly complained about 
situations where we thought we 
were in ihe right and they were 
wrong. 

One of my friends told me thai 
be was recendy pulled over not loo 
far down ihc road fmm my house 
I agreed with him thai whai he got 
a iickei for was unreasonable. 

A car came around the curve in 
front of him and it had its brighis 
on. So tike any normal driver be 



quickly flashed bis brigbis, asking 
Ihe other car to turn off its bright 
hghis 

Reasonable enough. I thought, 
wouldn't JUSI about everyone 
agree? Ii turned oui thai the car 
with ils bnghts on was a cop and he 
pulled my friend over and gave him 
a UckeL 

My friend did nothing wrong 
and he was given a ticket for ii I 
don't know about anyone else, bui 1 
think that was wrong 

Then there are tbe campus 
police, who I have found to be very 
competent and helpful at times. I 



have a tendency lo lock my keys in 
my car. which is a problem I have 
always gotten some pretty good 
help from the pohce. 

A couple of days ago a girl col- 
lapsed in one of my classes. The 
police and medics were there with- 
in two minutes 1 was personally 
impressed with our campus staff 

Although I'm trying not to say 
that there are good police and bad 
pohce, lis )usi that I'm upset with 
some of their acuom I am a firm 
believer dial actions speak louder 
than wottls.

Help Your Heart 



What IS going on today to cause 
numerous occasions where children 
go to school with a gun and kill theu* 
classmates? 

Are the parents that absent from 
their hves'' Are there no adult figures 
involved with these children^ Or are 
we Just faihng our children as parents? 

By now, most of us have heard 
about die latest tragedy m Arkansas. 
Two young boys, just children, widi a 
gun enter school ^^'^ proceed to elim- 
inate four young lives and the life of a 



teacher, 

1 guess what 1 don't understand is 
how did these children reach that 
point widiout anyone noticing there 
was a problem before they grabbed for 
tie guns^ 

Before our press time, the rumors 
were that one of die boys was dumped 
by a girl and bad stated that he would 
kill anyone else that broke up widi 
him Apparently, someone did 

Maybe this chdd has a probletn 
with rejetuon Perhaps he fell that 



many people have left him behind and 

It wouldn't happen to him again, with- 
out retaliation 

Personally, I think, that the fami- 
hes are accountable for die actions ot 
these young boys. Somewhere they 
have been failed by dieir par- 
ents and extended families 

Perhaps we all can learn 
from, yet another, tragedy. 
Perhaps now a few parents 
will lock dieir guns away 
from their children

a writer instead of Kate Winslct. 
and Kim Basinger took home the 
Best Supporting Actress award for 
her pad in "L.A. Confidential"

Worsi Actor and Worst Direcior 

"The Postman" aJso went home 
with lhe awards for lhe Worst 
Screenplay and Worst Piclurc 

Thai brings Iheir grand loials of 
Razzies to five 

"Double Team" featured Jean- 
Claude van Damme as his siereoiyp-

dent bad boy Dennis Rodman 
Rodman received an outstanding 
three Razzies 

They were Worst Supporting 
Actor and Worst New Actor. Jean- 
Claude and Dennis also shared the 
Worst Screen Couple award 

It's very seldom that Rodman 
buries the trey, but he managed lo 
earn three Razzies. and hopefully 
this also buried his acting career. 

The category thai I actually pre- 
dicied correctly was the Worst 
AcUess caie gory- 
Demi Moore took away the 
award for her portrayal of a woman 
who goes through Navy S.E.A.L. 
trainmg 

Alicia Silversione earned her 
award for Worst Supporting Actress 
m the summer hit "Batman &amp;

Look for Ms Silvetitone to take 
this award again next year with 
"Excess Baggage." 

The awards committee added a 
new category to the awards ceremo- 
ny diis year. 

It's the Worst Reckless

went to "Con \a."

Wild Things: 



C larks ville 



By Gran Roberts and Pat Carter 



Softcore porn? 

Maybe, but a good flick anyway 



By Gajl Ruble Crawford 
News Eoptor 

Alnghl. ril admii it— I was NOT 
Ihc one who chose Ihis movie Tor 
our weekend viewing pleasure. 

Thai honor goes to one of my 
younger hroihcrs, However, I liked 
what I saw— anJ boy, did 1 gel an 
eyeful of ihings ihai I wasn't 
expecting, and some were much 
beiicr ihan others 

Wild Things, now playing 
ai local theaters, stars Scream- 
Chick Ncvc Campbell. Matt 
DlUon, and Kevin Bacon as resi- 
dents of a stnall town In Florida. 

Campbell plays Suzie, a 
dr\j|ged-out Iramp who lives in a 
trailer behind a alligator-infested 
wrestling freak show in ibe 
Everglades 

Kelly, played by Denise 
Richards, is ihe girl from the right 
side of the tracks who is hoi. hot. 
hot for school guidance counselor 
Sam Lombardo (Dillon). 

She makes every effon to get 
him into bed. but be always spurns 
ber advances. 

One sunny day. Kelly and a 
friend offer to wash Lombardo's 
jeep for a school fundraiser 

After a gratuitous bunch of 
shots of a water-soaked Kelly. 
Kelly makes a move on poor Mr 
Lombardo. 

The ne»t shot shows Kelly 
running angrily from Lombardo's 
bouse with torn clothing 

Soon Kelly confesses to her 
mother, played by Black Widow's 
Debra Winger 

Her response to her daughter's 
admis.sion: "How dare be do that to 
meV Turns out, she is the town's 
good-Io-go rich-slut lady, and 
Lombardo is the town "him-bo. " 

They once had a passionate 
affair after Kelly's father commit- 
ted suicide. 

Kelly's mom, always con- 
cerned about how she looks in the 
eyes of the town, itiinks that be did 
this to Kelly just to get back at her 
r,-.-.- -Suddenly Dillon's character 
*j[aoes criminal charges of raping 
*Kelly " 

rhe plot soon thickens when 
Su2ie calls the investigating offi- 
cers. Bacon and Daphne Rubln- 
Vega. to her trailer and says that 
Dillon raped ber, too. 

Rubin-Vega's character does- 
n't believe Kelly, but seems to 
believe Suzie 

The case goes to court, and 
tearful testimonies are given by 
both girls. 

However, some starthng past 
indiscretions from Suzie's check- 
ered bfe arc brought to the court's 
aneniion, and Suzie admits to the 
court that she and Kelly made the 
whole thing up 

Dillon's ambulance-chasing 
lawyer, played by BUI Murray, 
sees an opportunity in- the girls' 
perjury. 

To spare themselves from fur- 
ther embajrassment, Kelly's fami- 
ly settles out of court for a nic« 
tidy sum of several milhon doll^i; 
with Dillon 

This seems simple enough thus 
far, ngAr' Think again Just when 
you think that you understand 
what the heck is going on. this 
movie does an about-face that 
nearly makes you fall out of your 
cushy theater scat. 



Turns out, Mr Lombardo. 
nice-guy guidance coun.selor. has a 
thing going on with bot-for-ieacher 
KcUy Ob. and he also has a thing 
going on with trampy Suzie. too. 

The kicker here: these arc not 
separate flings, if you catch my 
drift 

Yep. there are more gratuitous 
sen scenes than can probably fill 
most male fantasies m less ilian ten 
minutes of film. 

Warning: // you do not 
approve oj biseiual sei scenes or 
fult-fronial male nudii\. then I 
strongly advise you to skip this 
movie. 

Hint. hint. Let's just say that 
the men in this movie never take 
each other's clothes off However, 
there is a sc«ne towards the end 
where one of the characters need- 
lessly shows a bit more than tlie 
audience needed to sec. Judging by 
the "Oh my Gods" and "NO 
WAYS " that I heard m the theater 

This is one of those movies 
that Ls really good at sucking you 
in and making you unconsciously 
play a guesslng-game about what's 
going on. 

The plot has more twists than 
the President's current problems 

You have to pay close atten- 
tion to every single scene if you 
want to figure out what the bell is 
going on before it Ls revealed to 
you. 

Otherwise, you won't know 
the real story until the credits are 
done rolling 

Yeah, this movie is about as 
elegant as any B-movie plot. 

It also features sex, sex and 
more sex. if you like that kmd of 
thing. However, these things are 
only on the surface. 

If you really dig deep into Lhe 
story, this movie is complicated 
and contrived. 

It is also extremely well-wni- 
ten. 

Wild Things makes no 
claims of bemg on the intellectual 
or moral level of Titanic or Good 
WUI Hunting, but it is good enter- 
tainmcm for what it is— a movie 
about sex, lies, betrayal and the 
swamps of Southern Rorida.

Aramark is Making Changes for the Students 



By Susan Spindler 
Manaqino Editor 



Aramark, which is responsible 
for the cafeteria in Walb Union, is 
going through some positive 
changes. 

A few weeks ago new manage- 
ment took control of the cafeteria 
and the alterations began 

Scott Pearson is the latest mem- 
ber of the Aramark management 
team 

He has been m the industry for 
17 years and was working for 
Marriott before coming to our cam- 
pus cafeteria. 

The biggest contrast between 
the old Aramark and lhe tiew is that 
the new Aramark cares about its 
products and the service given to 
IPFW, 

The goals Pearson has set to 



accomplish in the cafeteria are long 
overdue and will benefit the student 
body of IPFW 

First, he wants to increase the 
quality of their food "More home- 
styte cooking, where food is made- 
to-order," said Pearson 

For those of us that eat there 
regularly, we have noticed thai there 
aren't as many burgers soaking up 
grease wbile waiung to be pur- 
chased. 

Instead, when you get up to the 
grill, the pohle Aramark employee 
is. normally, just finishing cooking 
up a new batch 

They are also moving away 
from anything processed. 

The roast beef ihey had avail- 
able last week was like Mom's 

Another change to come 
includes expanding the menu selec-

Which means, for S2. a student 
can get a sandwich and beverage. 
Try that at a fast food restaurant 

The third goal is to cater more 
towards the students' needs which 
makes sense. 

The food cart in Keiller is now 
open from 4 p.m -6 p m , allowing 
night students the chance at some 
decent food instead of being forced 
to eat out of the vending tnachines. 
Plus, some of the prices have 
dropped considerably. 



Okay, now for the big issue. . . 
hours The Kettler food can will be 
open dunng the stmimer sessions, 
tentatively, from 11 ajn.-l p,m. 

As far as increasmg hours now, 
dunng a regular semester, it is being 
looked mto Pearson is watching 
sales and traffic through the cafete- 
na after 2 p.m and checking the 
vending machine sales after houc^. 

The possibility of longer hours, 
staymg open until 6 p m . for a "trial 
week" is being discu&amp;sed 

The new goals of Aramark are 
obtainable and would benefit all of 
the customers of Aramark 

The overall service is improv- 
ing and our concerns are being taken 
seriously, thanks to the new man- 
agement. 



It's a simple thing, really. 

You might have been hearing lately that the Supreme 
Court satd federal credit unions have to stop adding 
members from more than one employee group. That's 
because a law written in 1934 is worded that way. 

It would be simple to change it. Simple to give back consumers' 
right to choose where to transact their financial business. Simple to 
give employees of small businesses the opportunity to choose the 
credit union option. Simple to let consumers benefit from the lower 
fees, better rates and better service that not-for-profit credit unions 
can provide. 

H.R. 1151, a bill pending in the U.S. Congress, can change it. The 
bill says, simply; 

"Section 109 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 L/.S.C. 1759) is 
amended by striking 'Federal Credit Union membership shall be 
limited to groups having a common bond' atid inserting 'the 
membership of amj federal credit union sliaU be limited to one or 
more groups each dfwliich have (within such group) a common 
bond. " 

Isn't that simple? 

Unless H.R, 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, is passed, 
63 percent of American workers face the possibility of being denied 
the option of credit union membership. Maybe even you. 

Thanks from credit unions to Congressman Mark Souder, who 
already has co-sponsored H.R. 1151! But the fight is not over. 
Write to your senators today and ask them lo vote for legisla- 
tion that will protect the right of all citizens to choose the 
credit union alternative:

ITie Final Four has been set and 



Volleydon's rip through Trojans 



By Tony Laux 
Sports Edptor 

After several matches this year 
Coach Amie Ball commented that 
bis team needed to continue to raise 
the level of play if they wanted to 
win. This may have happened this 
weekend at the Spring Fling, IPFW 
faced two teams that are ranked ui 
the Top 15 in the nation and beat 
them both 

On Friday the Etons faced the 
University of Pacific and swept 
them in three straight matches. 
Hector Soio had a match high 24 
kills while setter Chns Gisslen 
dished out 48 assists The Dons 
dominated the match in almost 
every statistical category by a wide 
margin and won the second match 
in a 15-0 sweep, 

Saturday nigbt the Trojans 
came calhng on the Mastodons and 
found the same result as Pacific 
The Dons won the first two match- 
es before losing the third 16-14 and 
winning the fourth match 15-12, 
use faced a balanced attack by the 
Dons with Ricardo Soler. Hector 
Soto and Javier Escobar each hav- 
ing at least twenty kills. Chris 
Gisslen handed out 77 assists to go 
along with four blocks 

The Dons go right back into tbe 
fire this weekend with two Midwest 
Intercollegiate Volleyball 



Associations (MIVA) road matches 
On Fnday the Dons will face the 
Ramblers of Loyola-Chicago Six 
starters return for Coach Gordon 
Mayforth including all-MIVA star 
DanSchult2 Scbultz wasin thelop 
ten in hitting percentage and kills 
per game, right behind Hector Soto, 

Last year's match against 
Loyola was a five-game nailbiier 
with IPFW coming out on top Ted 
Groves and Marcos Cordova will 
try and help Schultz keep the team 
in the Top 10 Cordova was tied for 
second m the conference la.st year 
in aces and will test the [&gt;ons 
defense 

Lewis University will be the 
next stop on the road to the MIVA 
conference championship The 
Flyers are led by opposite hitler 
Victor Rivera. 

Rivera, an all-MIVA player, is 



one of the most well-rounded play- 
er in the conference. He was m the 
lop ten in hitting percentage, blocks 
per game, kills per game, aces per 
game and digs per game 

Role players that will have to 
step up include Eduardo Quinones, 
Erie Simms and Edgardo Deni/. 
These three will play a major role in 
trying to derail the Dt)ns 

Coach Dave Deuser's 5th sea- 
son may he his toughest to repeat as 
runner-up in the championship 
With seven freshman on the roster 
his team may be a "sleeper" ai the 
MIVA Championships at Ball Stale 
April 17-18 

Tbe next two home mjtihc-. 
will be on April 3 and 4, Rulgtr\- 
Newark and Penn State will maJte 
the trip to face the Top 10 ranked 
Dons.
