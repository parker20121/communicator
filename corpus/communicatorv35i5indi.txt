Miller and the rest of the 
marketing team in athletics 
won a top award in student pro- 
motion for last year's car give- 
away, and IPFW was the only 
school in the country to double 
its attendance of men's basket- 
ball and tennis last year. 

Students are getting 



the past year in funding a tail- 
gate party, signing up 450 stu- 
dents to its membership during 
SOAR, and bringing around 
250 people to the first women's 
volleyball game of the season. 
, Miller says it's about 
encouraging students to have 
pride in their school; he hopes 
the days of students claiming 
their degrees are from Indiana 
or Purdue are almost over. "At

Athletics has certainly

have attracted celebrities like

Rodgers's

of the writer of the column, 
Tim Rodgers, I would like to 
say that if Murray had really 
thought about ihe contenl of 
ihe article, she would have 

Catholic, nor anti-auything in 
il. Rodgers' words are simply, 
"why don'l you see those 
things?" Granted, he took a 
more leftist and liberal 
approach to the topic. Still I 
give him praise for putting it 
in a style of writing and lan- 
guage that I think the people 
of our generation can under- 
stand. There was no beating 
around the bush, no political 
correctness in his type. He 
said what he meant, straight 
and lo the point. 

I want to ask a question 
of my own, why don't you

road to recovery working for 
the church, instead of being 
stuck in the same place? 

Why not use the power 
of the church lo rehabilitate -- 
and in the way Rodgers out- 
lined? Don't give them soup, 
offer them a job working 
alongside you. Sister. I do not 
understand what the problem 
is with asking these questions, 
and pulling them in a form 
thai people can understand. 

You always see the cler- 
gy working alongside those 
people, but you never see 
those people working along- 
side the clergy. You don't see 
Ihe handicapped up at the pul- 
pit preaching. Have you ever 
heard of a pastor being a for- 
mer "wino" who was laken in 
and put on the road to recov- 
ery? Point being, you never 
see them trying to bring the 
people they are trying to help 

I will not say that 
Rodgers was not at fault. He 

did cross a few lines and tram- 
ple a few toes, but il takes a 
stronger person to speak his 
opinion and stand behind it 
than il does lo tear it apart. 

Lastly, Rodgers' column

some stories focused on the

I had to do was wait five min-

would have yet another report 
on American politics — espe- 
cially John Kerry. 1 even heard 
a promotion for a special report 
on gerrymandering in the 
United States. 

"Gerrymandering?" I 
asked myself moments after I 
heard the promo. I stared at my 
computer and thought back to 
my elevendi-grade history class 
and what exactly that strange 
word meant. "How many 
Americans even know what 
that is?"

I wanted to quit listening

thought that might be bad to do 
as a journalist. So I knew I 
needed to look for my national 
news somewhere else. 

I looked for a resource on 
the other side of the ocean, and 
I found the British 
Broadcasting Corporation. I 
was still done with television,

March beginning for art of new 
fiberglass Mastodons On Parade 



The Masiodons on Parade 
Community An Project is seek- 
ing design proposals from 
artists, designers, architects, 
community members and cre- 
ative groups from Allen County 
and surrounding areas. 

The Mastodons on Parade 
is a collaboration of area busi- 
nesses, local artists, and com- 
munity organizations, to help 
IPFW commemorate the 40th 
anniversary. The goal is to fill 
Fort Wayne with 40 individual- 
ized fiberglass replicas of the 

mastodon. 

The mastodons will be 
designed by artists, and, if 
approved by the Art Review 



Committee, then sponsored. 
For several months, (the first 
Monday of the months through 
March 2005) artists will have 
chances to submit designs. 

The Mastodons on Parade 
community art project is similar 
to what many other regions 
have done, including 
Washington, D.C., Utah. 
Raleigh!] North Carolina and 
others even around the world. 

Many citywide events arc 
planned to display publicly the 
mastodons from May through 
September 2005. An auction 
will then be held, with proceeds 
going to the United Way of 
Allen County. 

They will be on parade, at 



a variety of events, including 
Three Rivers Festival, Gold 
Wings Convention, 

Reoopening of the Grand 
Wayne Center, Germanfest, 
Greekfest, Johnny Applesecd 
Festival, concerts and programs 
at the Allen County War 
Memorial Coliseum and mis- 
cellaneous sporting events. 

The Call for Proposals can 
be downloaded from the web- 
site via IPFW's home page, 

www.mjsiodons.org. 

The official sponsor of the 
eveni is Tower Bank.
