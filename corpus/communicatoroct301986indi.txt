Walker a guest 
at university 
lecture series 




Alice Walker 

By LILLIAN LYON 
Managing Editor 

Here is your chance for a personal 
conversation with Alice Walker, 
Pulitzer Prize-winning author of 'The 
Color Purple.' 'In Search of Our 
Mother's Gardens,' and 'Horses Make a 
Landscape Look More Beautiful.' 

How? This Wed., Nov. 5, at 9 p.m., 
Alice Walker will be live at IPFW in the 
Classroom Medical Building, Room 159 
— via satellite hook-up from San 
Francisco, Ca lifornia . The presentation 



will be broadcast to dozens of college 
campuses aeross'the country. 

The presentation is co-sponsored by 
the School of Arts and Letlers, the 
department of English and Linguistics, 
the Indiana University President's 
Council for the Humanities, the fPFW 
Studenl Union Board of Governors, and 
Women's studies It is the first in a 
series entitled "The Impossible Lecture 
Series," a program developed and 
marketed by the American Program 
Bureau to bring to campuses authors 
and other lecturers who do not nor- 
mally make personal speaking ap- 
pearances or travel on a lecture tour. 

Walker will present a dramatic 
reading in addition to discussing the 
issues of an artist whose work is con- 
verted to film, her personal reflections 
on the movie "The Color Purple," her 
concept of an artist's role in today's 
society and fiction and poetry writing. 

Following i he lecture, viewers may 
participate and ask Walker questions

Bachelor's of Arts degree from Sarah 
Lawrence, has taught at several 
universities and colleges in the United 
States, among them Jackson State,

Computer expansion 
adds new terminals 



By LILLIAN R. LYON 

Managing Editor 
Finding it hard to get computer 
terminal time to complete your 
classwork'' The solution is here- 
New terminal clusters have been 
installed in three campus buildings to 
facilitate student course work, said 
Alan Federman, coordinator of 
academic computing in the computing 
and data processing department. 

"Additional terminals make il easier 
for students to sign on for terminal 
course work," Federman said. "Last 
year il was hard for students to get 
computer time." 

New terminals have been placed in 
the library opposite the entrance, in 



Neff Hall. Room B74 and in Kettler 
Hall, Room 204A. The terminals in the 
library are also used by library staff, 
and faculty members use the com- 
puters for research. 

The new terminals have increased 
capabilities, Federman said. "Some 
terminals are graphics-capable, which 
is a new feature," he said. Graphics- 
capability allows the user to create a 
wide range of charts, graphs and other 
drawings 

Federman commented that many 
students are not aware of the clusters in 
Ketllerand Neff Halls. "They are more 
aware of the library terminals because 
they are visible to from outside," 
Federman said. 



Red Cross still needs donors 



In early September, The Com- 
municator reported the Allen-Wells 
Chapter of the Red Cross had declared 
a blood emergency on Aug. 25, and that 
a code red, an all-blood- types-needed 
situation, was in effect The blood 
supply in an emergency state is 
dangerously low and the public is asked 
to donate, regardless of blood type they 

The emergency has long since 
cleared, and the Red Cross is now in 
code green, or at a safe blood supply 
level. But code green does not mean 
donors are not needed. 

"We want everybody to continue to 
donate, but we are not in an emergency 



Parking 
for guests 
a problem 



The University Police and Safety 
Department has announced a policy 
they would like to see followed during 
situations warranting special guest 
parking 

The increase in requests for 

suspension of parking regulations in 
situations like these has increased 
greatly, said a memorandum 
distributed to IPFW faculty. Con- 
sequently, a burden is placed on the 
present parking program for em- 
ployees and students. 

Complimentary parking permits can 
be obtained for such guests, Roby said, 
or visitors can be directed to park in 
specific lots. Roby said his staff would 
be willing to work with people coor- 
dinating events to choose lots ap- 
propriate for a program's need, while 
keeping others' needs in mind. 

The alternatives, Roby continued, 
will help his department from ticketing 
unnecessarily during such guest 
situations, and still afford the depart- 
ment the chance to offer com- 
plimentary parking to guests. 



situation, 1 said Marcia Robbins, 
director of chapter donor recruitment 
at the California Road site. 

Code yellow is the other situalion for 
blood supply levels Yellow means that 
only certain blood types are needed, 
and the types are announced when the 
situalion is broadcast. Donors can also 
call the Red Cross. 

Donating blood is a simple process, 
taking only an hour at most. But the 
process your blood must go through to 
be used for medical purposes takes a 
great deal longer depending upon how it 
is needed — as whole blood or divided 
up into components for various pur- 

Because of (his two-day difference, 



donors should nui wait until a code red 
situation or a blood emergency. The 
Red Cross collects for 57 hospitals in 
Iheir 37-county area. It is the only 
collecting agency in Fort Wayne with 
the facilities to process blood to make it 
safe for use 

Though the Red Cross office in Fort 
Wayne takes donors, they also par- 
ticipate in sponsored blood drives For 
example, on Nov 6, the Clerical Service 
Staff Advisory Committee (CSSAC) is 
holding a fall blood drive in Walb 
Memorial Union Building, Suites G21 
jrid G21A -Signup sheets are available 
in Kelller Hall at the information desk, 
in Helmke Library at the circulation 
desk, and in Walb at Ihe Sweete Shoppe. 



Faculty or students who wish to 
donate should eat within six hours prior 
to Ihe donation, although no greasy 
foods can be ingested. Also, a good 
night's rest is important, and no 
strenuous activity should follow the 
donation. 

To give blood, donors must be 17-65 
years old, weigh at least 110 pounds, be 
in good health la limited physical 
examination is giveni Donors are also 
tested for biood pressure levels, body 
temperature and blood iron counts. A 
brief family history is also taken. 

Robbins stressed (hat all equipment, 
from swabs to syringes, is disposable, 
so there is no chance of contacting a 
communicable disease from con- 
taminated material.

Education before profit 



Firstlnaeer.es 

Another semester of class registration is 
about to begin. Most of the same classes are 
being offered, which is all right; after .ill. 
calculus doesn't change much year to year 

Unfortunately, neither does the way IPFW 
holds its registration process. This is 
something that desperately needs changed. 

IPFW has grown into a fairly good-sized 
campus but the registration process is 
reminiscent of a one-room school house. 

Part of the problem is that the system is 
working backwards. It is decided what 
classes are going to be offered by what the 
professors feel like teaching. Then the 
students gel to choose from that It should be 
the other way around. Students should be 
given a list of all the classes IPFW professors 
are qualified to leach. After that the students 
can choose what classes they'd like to take. 
Then the administration can decide how 
many classes are needed for each course. 
This is how Purdue does it. It simply makes 
more sense. 

This high demand-low supply situation 
found in IPFW's registration process is fine 
for business but it should not be used to 
capitalize a state-funded institution. 

By glancing over some back-issues of The 
Communicator an article on changing the 
registration could be found. This discovery 
was not very encouraging. First it was 
written in the fall of 1985 and nothing has been 
done yet Second, the only thing the ad- 
ministration was going to change was the fee 



payment deadline. 

Obviously we have a very good 
businessman somewhere high up in this 
organization. We. the students, are simply 
education consumers. We consume 
everything we are given, either because we 
don't know any belter or we are very poor 
business people. 

Perhaps it is time we, the consumers, did 
something to help ourselves instead of 
wailing for a change to drop in our laps. After 
all why should they change? They've cor- 
nered the market. 

If the students could get the ad- 
ministration's attention and remind them 
that the function of IPFW is to educate, not to 
turn it into a Fortune SOO company, maybe 
something could be accomplished. 

Maybe the only way to accomplish 
something is if everyone bombarded the 
registrar's office with letters, phone calls, 
personal visits if you can arrange it. Tell him 
that you are afraid education is taking second 
place and that a healthy change in 
registration would help pull us into the 80's 
with the other Indiana schools 

Also you might mention since Chancellor 
Wallace is pulling together a Task Force on 
the quality of university life anyway, this 
might be the perfect opportunity for 
change. 

If nothing else, the administration might 
get so tired of consumer complaints they 
might do something. 

But do not hold your breath. 



Student votes do count 



What are you doing Tuesday? Is a trip to the 
polls on your agenda for the day? 

Are you concerned about why you did not 
get as much state assistance (o help pay your 
tuition as you would have liked? Do you wish 
the rest of the funding. for the proposed fine 
arts building on campus would get approved 
by the General Assembly? Do you complain 
that your car's alignment, shocks and tires 
are ruined after trying to dodge the potholes 
on Fori Wayne streets and state highways? 

Are you worried the money being deducted 
from your weekly pay check for social 
security won't be there when you turn 62 
years old? Do you wonder why your property 
taxes, license plate taxes and the food and 
beverage laxes are so high 1 Are you, as 
prospective job candidates, hoping that there 
will be proper economic development in the 
next two to four years to ensure that Indiana 
will have jobs available for college 
graduates? 

The point we are trying to make is that 
students often think their vote doesn't count. 
Many students probably never even register 
lo vote 

But that philosophy of politics is wrong. The 
students' votes do count. They count when 
legislators are trying to decide whether to 
approve the remaining funding for the fine 
arts building. They count when the same 
legislators remember that student voters 
elected them, and maybe the IPFW students 
really would like to have the fine arts building 



constructed in our lifetime. 

The same students who have not registered 
to vote and who will not vote Tuesday are 
probably thesame ones who will be the first to 
complain when they don't get Iheir tuition 
assistance from the state or when they have 
to pay high taxes They will complain when 
the roads are in a state of disrepair and they 
have to pay to get their cars realigned. And 
you can be guaranteed they would chime in to 
complain with others about the funding for 
buildings on universities. 

It is of utmost importance that students 
remember that elected officials do keep their 
constituents in mind when voting in the House 
and in the Senate. But if you are not a 
registered voter, or if you are and just don't 
take the time to vote, how will they know what 
your concerns are? If you don't care enough 
lo vote, why should they care enough lo listen 
to your complaints? 

Tell the legislators you are worried that 
social security funds will not be there when 
you retire; you are worried about the high 
cost of license plate laxes; you are worried 
your campus will not be improved by the 
addition of a fine arts building because 
enough funding was not received from the 

Before you exercise your right to complain 
about the elected officials and their per- 
formance in office, you have to exercise your 
right to vote — on Nov 4

Letter to the Editors 



I V 

Oct. 



■ Editor: 

was surprised by the 
23 Communicator 
editorial protesting no 
knowledge of the ihree-week 
trial period for weekend 
hours at the Multipurpose 
Building. Only one week 
earlier the Communicator 
itself carried a front-page 
article about (he new hours. 
Joseph Motherwell, 
president of Students' 
Government, mentioned to 
me several months ago the 
need to open the Multipur- 
pose Building on weekends to 
accommodate the busy 
schedules of IPFW students. 
It was in response to this 
very legitimate request that 
a trial period was 
authorized, and I asked 
Students' Government's help 
and advice on the best way to 
publicize it among our 



students The Athletics 
Office informed Motherwell 
of the trial schedule, and I 
appreciate his notifying the 
sludent newspaper about 
what was being planned. 
Announcements of the trial 
period appeared in the 
Communicator on Oct. 16 
and Oct. 23, in flyers placed 
about campus by Students' 
Government, in notices 
posted in the Multipurpose 
Building by the Athletics 
Office, and in the October 
issue of the faculty and staff 
newsletter Briefings 

In retrospect, the whole 
question of who- info rmed- 
whom-and-when does point 
to how difficult it is to 
communicate with students 
al an urban campus. I am 
very much interested in 
exploring with Students' 
Government, Communicator 



Staff writers needed 



staff, and any other in- 
terested persons ways in 
which all or us can com- 
municate more effectively 
The trial period for the 
Multipurpose Building is 
only one example of in- 
formation that needs to 
reach our students in a 
timely fashion. 

The good news is thai, 
despite communications 
concerns, (he response to the 
new hours has been 
significant enough to 
warrant keeping the 
Multipurpose Building open 
on weekends for the 
remainder of the academic 
year, assuming the interest 
continues to justify the 
additional hours. These 
hours are from noon to 3 p.m 
on Saturdays and 2 p.m. to 5 
p.m. on Sundays, in addition 
lo the regular weekday 
hours. I encourage students,

Center helps everyone

"When they told me it was 
impossible to get help for 
children who were failing, I 
decided to do something 
about it," said Sister Miriam 
Schulthois, founder of the 
Benel Learning Center. 

The Benet Learning 
Center was founded in 1973 
when Sister Miriam realized 
how many children needed 
help: personally, 
academically, emotionally, 
and socially She wanted to 
help children who were 
"falling through the cracks" 
in the school system by 
reaching them through a 
one-on-one tutoring basis. 

"It is hard to keep good 
instructors because most of 
them are volunteers and 
eventually get better job 
offers somewhere else." 
commented Sister Miriam. 

The center tutors children 
who cannot adapt to a 
regular curriculum and that 
have learning disabilities 
from which they developed a 
poor self -concept. Often a 
child is bright but cannot 
learn in a typical school 
setting. The first step in 
assisting a learning disabled 
child is building his-her self- 



confidence. Once a child has 
a better self-image and 
begins to have some success, 
the learning disability often 
disappears, says Sister 
Miriam. 

Adults lacking formal 
education feel that they 
cannot function in a group, 
so they do not enroll in adult 
classes. Many would prefer a 
one-to-one tutoring basis. 
Adults can also take the 
G.E.D. (the high school 
equivalency test) through 
the center. 

When students enter the 
school, they are tested to 
determine their strengths 
and weaknesses. A per- 
sonalized curriculum is then 
prescribed. The students are 
periodically tested to 
measure their progress. 
Special attention is given to 
all to help improve learning 
abilities. Each student is 
assigned a tutor that is 
responsible for guiding the 
student through the 
curriculum, according to 
Sister Miriam. 

The Benet Learning 
Center recognizes the 
benefits of having a student 
attend regular school with 
his-her peers. Students are 
taught how to develop good 



study habits and how to get 
maximum benefits from 
their use of time. 

Many schools do not even 
realize that the center exists. 
If they do recommend the 
center, it is only as a last 
resort. "We are the best kept 
secretin Fort Wayne," joked 
Sister Miriam. 

The school itself is a non- 
profit, self-supporting 
organization. A monthly 
tuition is charged, with 
special arrangements made 
for deferred payments. The 
center also accepts 
donations which is tax 
deductible. 

If you need any further 
information you can call or 
stop by the center, 1671 Spy 
Run Avenue.

"We are very anxious to 
gel started," said fifth year 
Coach Tim Russell. "We felt 
like a lot of people had bad 
years all at once last year. 
We all accept the blame for 
what happened, and, 
because of it, you're going 
to see a much more mature, 
harder-working team this 

Russell anticipates im- 
provement from his four 
seniors — Bruce Erwin, Jim 
Morlan. Scott Reed and 
Charles Washington. That 
quartet, coupled with 
returning lettermen Richard 
Ivy and Eric Wilson, gives 
Russell a solid crew with a 
lot of collegiate experience. 

"I would expect to have a 
better club with just the 
people we have coming 
back," Russell said. "Just 
the fact that they have 
played together, matured 
together, and are a year 
older and wiser should make 
us a stronger team. 

Washington and Morlan 
are the first players Russell 



has had under his command 
for a full four-year career, 
Reed and Erwin joined the 
squad last season as junior 
college transfers. 

At 6-7 and 6-6 respectively, 
Erwin and Morlan are 
counted on to do the bulk of 
the inside work this season. 
Both played well down the 
stretch last year and should 
be prepared to lead the way. 

Veterans Reed , 
Washington, Ivy and Wilson 
should be pushed by a strong 
set of newcomers, led by 
three junior college trans- 
fers. Dennis Williams is a 
solid inside player from 
Malcolm X Junior College in 
Chicago and Pat Pollard 
(Illinois Central College) 
and Bobby Marshall (Lin- 
coln College) are strong 
perimeter players who 
aren't afraid to mix it up 
inside. That trio could play 
an integral part in Ihe 
Mastodons' fortunes in 1986- 
B7. 

Another player who could 
figure strongly in Russell's 



plans is Bruce Roland. 
Roland played one game for 
the Mastodons last year 
before leaving the team. He 
returned to the classroom 
this summer and is expected 
to be eligible by December 
21. The squad is completed 
by returnee Eric Metheny 
and freshmen Rex Carroll. 
Jim Rayl and Kevin Soltis. 

The Mastodons' schedule 
includes some of the top 
talent in NCAA Division II. 

"To start off, our con- 
ference is very strong from 
lop to bottom," Russell said. 
"Kentucky Wesleyan, 
Southern Indiana, Lewis, 
and Bellarmine have strong 
programs year after year. 
Wesleyan and Southern 
Indiana both have a 
tremendous amount of talent 
back. Add two games 
against Wright State to our 
conference schedule, and 
you have 18 games against 
the very best in Division II." 

The Mastodons also will 
participate in two tour- 
naments this year. They 



open the season hosting Lake 
Superior State, Rosary 
College and St. Francis, 
November 21 and 22, in the 



IPFW Tip-off Classic. On 

December 29 and 30, IPFW 
will play in the Findlay

beautiful course. We have 
been invited back there for 
next year's regionals, and 
the National Championship 
will be held there loo next 
year," Coach Kast com- 
mented. 

"I feel we have just im- 
proved so much this year. I 
am very pleased with that. 
We are all looking forward to 
next year with enthusiasm. 
We will be having fun runs 




that are open to everyone on
