Missing tiles believed to be cause of Columbia's crash 



Anolhrr crash has marred 
Ihc image ^nd reputnliott a( the 
space program. The Space 
Snultle Columbia, along with its 

destroyed on Satuiday in whai 
is believed lo be an accident 
involving Ihe iruulation liles on 
one d( Ihe shullle's wings. 

Many IPFVV studenls are 
loo young lo remember Ihc last 
tragedy, the eiLptosion the 
Shuttle Challenger, shorlly alter 
i(5 take olf in 19S6. Even though 
accidents such as this are tragic 
and shocking, Ihev are also rare. 
The destruction of Ihe Columbia 
represents only the second acci- 
denl, which has resulted in a 
loss of life, out of more Ihan 150 
manned flights undertaken by 
NASA. 

However, Ihc shultle's

may be al ieasi pariially to 
blame tor Ihe desliuclion of the 
Columbia. Michael VViskcrchen, 
associate director of the 
California Space Irtslilule al the 
University of California. San 
Diego was quoted by Newsweek 
as saying, This has everything 
lo do with money, and the time

NASA, and the drive to priva- 

Profess or Carlos PomalaTO- 
Raez, who is Chair of the 
Engmecring Department at 
IPFW does not believe that Ihe 
accident should affect the space 
program, "We have to accept the 
risla involved unless the coun- 
try wants to forget about space 
exploration. We have airplane 
crashes, car crashes, train crash- 
es; it happens. Does that mean 
that we should not drive or fly?" 
said Pomalaza-Raez. 

Though rumors of sabotage 
or terrorism had begun lo circu- 
late after the accident, officials a I 
NASA now believe that missing 
heal liles may have been respon- 
sible for Ihe crash of the Space 
Shuttle Columbia on Salurday. It 
had been suggested that some 



msulalion, which had broken off 
of a rocket booster and hit the 
left wing durmg Ihe shuttle's 
launch, may have been responsi- 
ble for damaging the tiles on Ihe 

However, Space Shuttle 
Program Manager Ron 
Diltcmorc believes thai the 
impact of Ihe insulation w,is, 
"inconsequential," but added 
that nothing has been ruled out 
as a possible cause, according to 
NASA's Web site. In ordet for 
the tiles lo have been responsible 
for the accident a substantial 
amount of them would have to 
have been affected, according to 
Pomalaza-Raei, "They would 
have to lose ten or more tile right 
next to each other to have an 
effect," Pomalaaa-Baei 

remarked. 

The liles are crucial to reen- 
try lot the rocket since they pro- 
vide insulation for the ship's 
aluminum frame against tem- 
peratures which can reach more 
that 3000 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Aluminum is used for [he frame 
of all of Ihe shuttles as well as 
most ' commercial aircraft 
because it is relatively lough, but 



also lightweight. It does not. 
however, withstand hieh lem- 

feratures well, according lo 
rofessor Robert |, Duchovic of 
IPFW's chemistry department. 

This may suggest another 
cause for the crash, "(The crash] 
could have also been caused by 
structural faligue. The airframe 
itself could have failed, though 
there has not yet been any data 
to support this. "said Duchovic. 
NASA is currently continumg ils

Gathering the debris from the

been a crucial aspect of the 
investigation. Residents of the 
area surrounding the crash site

Financial aid changes may affect IPFW students 



Now is Ihe time of year 
when students' thoughts hjm to 
money, specifically lo financial 
aid and scholarship money. In 
addition to the multitude of 
existing forms and regutntions 
that students have had to deal 
with m onder to apply lor finan- 
cial aid ond scholarships, there 
are some rules that are new this 
spring. 

One of the biggest changes 
involves the filing date for the 
FAFSA, which is Ihe form that 
studenls must file to receive fed- 
eral and slate funds. This year 
the Filing deadline has changed 



in several ways. First, it has been 
moved from March 1 to March 
10 for those studenls who wish 
to receive an SSACl grant from 
the slate. This is also different 
from previous yea;s because the 
new date is no longer Ihc date by 
which Ihe form must be post- 
marked. It IS the date Ihal the 
form must be received by the 

Even though studenls tech- 
nically have a longer deadline, 
they are still being urged to file 
as early as possible, "I'm recom- 
mending that studenls still shoot 
for that March 1 dale, (fncome 
figures! can tie an estimate, as 
long as the form is submitted. It 
can be amended later if neces- 



i Gerald Curd, 
ireclor of Ihe IPRV 
Financial aid department. He 
alsQ advises students to file their 
FAFSA online because thai 
method offers several benefits. 

The student will be able to 
sec their expected family contri- 
bution, or Ihe amount that finan- 
cial aid will not cover, instantly, 
ft is also much quicker to send 
the form electronically, "For all 
practical purposes it is instanta- 
neously received." said Curd. 

Another change that was 
instituted this semester involves 
Ihc dispersal of student loan 
money. Due lo a change in feder- 
al regulations. IPFW lost the 
exemption thai allowed first 



year studenls to forego a 30 day 
waiting period for their student 
loan dispersal. This wailing peri- 
od was irrslituted because the 
highest drop out rate occurs in 
students' first semester of 
school, specifically in the first 
lew weeks, "If, a student drops 
within the first thirty days, now 
Ihey won't end up with a 
defaulted loon." said Curd. 

Unfortunately this has 
placed a financial strain on stu- 
dents who need the loan money 
for books; or to help with other 
bills, IPFW's financial aid office 
has made attempts to assist stu- 
dents until they get Iheir loan 
money, "We've tried to assist stU' 
dents with emergency book 



loans, bul we quickly went over 
Ihc budgeted amount and had to 
slop," added Curd, Besides the 
federal and slate grants and stu- 
dent loarw there are numerous 
scholarships that studenls can 
avail themselves of to help cover 
expenses. 

Forms for IPFW scholar- 
ships, as well as Ihe FAFSA, are 
available in Ihe financial aid 
office. Curd also recommends 
the Web site www, fas tweb.com 
for scholarship searches. 
Students can go to wwwjtuden- 
taid,cd,gov to find out more 
about federal aid programs and 
lo file their FAFSA onW.

What 



inside the 



t goes 
heads of high school athletes 
these days? They are cocky and 
driven only by the all mighty 
dollar. It's actually kinda sad 

From Kevin Gamelt to Kobe 
Bryant and beyond, the stars of 
high school basketball have 

arroganl. The newest local pomt 
a( this arrogance: LeBron James. 
As any sports fan knows by 
now, lames was suspended for 
the resi of his senior season at St, 
Vincent-SI, Marj' in Ohio. Afler 
accepting over S800 of clothing 
(two throw-back jerseys), the 
Ohio High School Athletic 
Association look away the 
remainder ai James' high school 

Uh. d^ No slate (hampitsiship, 
; no third Ohio Mr. Basketball and 
no spot in the McDonald's 
All-Ameficao game. I feel bad 
for James, t really do. No wait, 1 
really don't. 

Let's all lace the facts. 
Nobody else has had the testicular 
fortitude to say this yet, so I will. 
James stole. Technically he didn't 
steal from the store, although he 
did lake things without paying. 
I'm not talking about stealing 
Gale Sayers and Wes Unscid 
jerseys, but he really did. 

He robbed so many people 
of so many things. He roobed Kis 
team of their good name. 
Likeivise. he did the same to his 
high school and town. He robbed 
myself and many people out 
there ol any respect they may 
have had lor him. And I guaranlee 
thai I had very little before and 
'. absolutely none now. 

I could care less how 

■good" James is. Big deal, he is 

I the best high school basketball 

' player in tne world. It's high 

school. Michael Jordan in lus 

; prime with the Chicago Bulls 

; could have dominated the high 

' school ranks too. Wait until next 

year and we'll see if he's worlh 

the hype. 

Sure 1 watched one of his 
games on ESPN2. He appears to 
be a solid player — I'll give him 
that much. But Joe Poindeidcr 
over at Elmhurst can amaie 
crowds with spectacular dunks 
and Jody Folks at North Side 
scored 40 points last week. So 
hoiv is James special? Oh yeah, 
he's not. 



and Tony Komhciser spend j 
half of Pandon the Interruptii 
breaking down the siluati 
Komhciser brought up an 
intriguing ijueslion when he 
asked il James should tie allowed 
back on his team il he relumed 
the jerseys. 

On Feb. 2, ESPN's usually 
respectable Dick Vltalc decided 
to voice his opinion on Ihat matter. 
Well, guess whal Vilale, your 
opinion sucks. I'll agree with one 
thing and one thing only, James 
made a mistake. I don't care if 
he's "done a heckuva job in the 
classroom." We're not kicking 
him out of school here, Vilale. 
Another point that Vitale and 
others have made is saying that 
James is only a kid. 

Well guess whal, James 
wants to tie treated like an adult, 
everyone saj's he should be treated 
like on adult and be allowed to 
make his own decisions. So, I say 
treat him like an adult. He's 18. 
he's not a kid, so don't Ireat him 
like that. Damn right James 
deserves a reprimand, and this is 
the one he deserves. I actually 
have lost respect for Vitale due to 
his comments on the subject. So 
as Vin Diesel said in "XXX," 
"Don't be a dick. Dick." 

[ know that if the Hummer 
incident never happened, then 
this one would have never been 
brought up. They had to bust this 
no good kid on something. 
That s right, 1 said no good. In 
my opinion, James was given 
that Hummer H2. Anyone could 
make up enough iaise inloimation 
lopiovideadequaledocumentation 
that his mother bought ihe car. 

Let's be honest, the James 
lamily is not wealthy and 
nowhere neat well enough oil to 
alfonj a 550,000 Hummer H2. So 
they obtained a batvk loan? Yeah, 
what kind of bonk is going to 
give a loan lo a person who has 



that Jan 
are the or 



&gt;' school and 
who really 



lost Fnday. He started it with 
"The Ohio High School Athletic 
Association is buggin'." Well, 
take some English classes and 
then gel back to me. Yes. Mr. 
Frazier. he is the hot slory of the 
moment. And as such, he should 
realize that he is under a more 
watdiful eye. Ask Tony Stewart 
or Chris Webber, Welcome to Ihe 
spotlight James, get used to it. 
And T do agree with Frazier's 



,nd guess 
screwed Ihem? Survey says: Oh 
yes, LeBron James. The OHSAA 
didn't screw anyone; they simply 
did their jobs. The OHSAA could 
care less if James was such a hot 
commodity. They come and they 
go. I'm sure that the OHSAA 
would rather not have a Ihief 
represenline them. 

Since the ruling, Dru Joyce, 
James' basketball coach, has 
implied several times that the 
media is at fault for prying into 
James' life and harassing the 
school. Is il just me or didn't St. 
Vincenl/Sl. Mary ask for this? 
Celebrities are always under the 
close eye of the media. It's part of 
being a celebrity. If you don't 

make James a celebrity;' 

■ ■' why c" ■ 

the ^JK^m^t d^idj;^!^ 
to travel the country lo give ' 
James more exposure. He went 
to IMorth Carolina, to Los 
Angeles and many other places 
to playoutofstaleond across the 
country'. All of that louring the 
school did was lo pull in more 
money. It's all aboul greed. St. 
Vincenl/St. Mary exposed James 
lo the media in exchange for 
racking in thousands of dollars, 
so who's being greedy now? 

How about allowing St, 
Vincent/St. Mary games lo be 
broadcast on national television? 
All we, as the media, did was 
cash in on Ihe decision of James' 
school. How dare they try and 
crucify us now for their mistake. 

He can appeal all he wants. 
His mother can complain thai 
she was not contacted when they 
were looking into the jersev 
situation. Guess what mom, its 
not your problem. Gloria James' 
had nothing lo do with this and 
needs lo slop whii\ing. 

I don't recall, did Gloria 
James take the jersey's? No. And 
considering the fact that l^Bron 
is of age, Gloria is technically not 
consicTeted a guardian. So guess 
what, nobody needed lo contact 
her, il wasn't her issue. 

He's 18 — let him grow up. 
It's been reported that James is 
depressed with the decision to 
suspend him. Well, tough James. 
Maybe someone should have 
thought of that. If I stole some 
shirts, was arresled, apologized 
and returned them, would I get a 
slap on the wrist? I don't Ihmk 
so. So 1 say we give LeBron James 
exactly what hedeser^'es: nothing. 



Issue with From the Left 



I have to fake issue with 
Ihe Jan. 29 column, "Social 
Inequality Runs Wild," by 
Penny Tsiguloff for a few 
reasons, the first of which is 
several (actual and statistical 
inaccuracies thai immediately 
jumped out at me. Admilledly, 1 
can't verify the numbers used 
in the column because the 

would like lo show the readers 
what 1 found in my limited 
research. 

Ms. Tsiguloff wrote, "80 
percent of the innor-cih^ poor 
?re minorities." According lo 
the United States Census 
2002, 46.4 percent of 
\ below the poverty 
White, Non- 



lor Medicare, Medicaid, 
education and many other 
social programs. Ms. Tsiguloff 
is once again trying lo skew {or 
outridit misiep resent) ihe policies 
of President Bush. I am 
convinced that she is shil stuck 
on her "Bush is a president the 
people didn't elect" argument, 
and she is allowmg it to distort 
her view ol reality {remind me 
to explain that whole electoral 
college concept to hersomebme. 
By the way. tliey counted all the 
votes in Florida. Bush still won.) 
What Penny is attempting 






. (.01 



' as they were incorrectly 
caiieo in the column). In fact, 
according to the same report, 
only 40 percent of Americans 
be low the poverty level reside 
.JiT^he" "inner-city." There is 
absolutely no way to manipulate 
these numbers lo provide Ihe 80 
percent figure lor inner city 
mmorilies cited in the column. 
1 also take issue with the 
repeated misrepresentation ol 



the 



: adi 



I spending policies. I 
checked a Uniled Stales 
governmeni Web site, 
www.whilehouse.gov, and 
guess what? The budget lor 
2003 includes increased spendmg 



outs and socialist progr 
can lix the problem ofpoverty I 
would submit that the problem 
Is not lack of government binding, 
but a decline in Ihe work ethic 
of our society, I find it amazing 
that unemployed Americans 
I picky about what kind of 



be glamorous, but they pay far 
better than not working at all. 
The fact is this — we as a nalion 
have become so spoiled that we 
would rather not ivork than 
take a job that is "beneath us." 
I remember my father 
working two jobs when 1 was a 
young child. He would work all 
day long, come home for a 
quick shower and then head 
right back out for another part- 
time Job. He did this so my 



molher could be home with me 
full-lime. I remember that neither 
of the jobs he was working paid 
well or were "dream jobs by 
any means, bul he made sura 
the bills were always paid and 
that our family always had 
everything we needed. 

IVhicn leads into my final 
point — the decline of morals 
and the destruction of the family 
has much more to do with 
poverty in this country than 
any other factor. According lo 
the 2002 Census Bureau rcfwrt, 
almost 60 pereent of farnilies 
below the poverty level were 
single parent households, I 
know In at the "progressive" 
readers at this school may not 
want to hear this, but the 
devaluation ol Ihe two-parent 
household has done more to 
increase poverty in this eouritry 
than anything else. 

Child support doesn't 
even remotely replace the missing

check will absolulcly not 
replace a missing parent.

--^ ■ ■ The album starts out with 

four tracks from their 1996 

release. "Gas City

rock and roll gui-

up. Kay's vocals 
go from deep.

neit two songs. "Creepy Guy" is 
a bass-driven punk rock tune 
with screaming vocals. The next 
ballad. "One of Them," 
foreshadows what was to come 
of the Beautys. It is reminiscent 
of their second full-length 
album, "Thing of Beauty." 

OH of tlieir "Sweetheart. 
Sweetheart" record come four 
diverse songs. "Sweetheart. 
Sweetheart" is a girly song with 
bile and a rocking guitar solo. 
"Jocks on |unk" is a fast, punk 
rock song dedicated to frat bov 
hipsters everywhere. "Black

Beautys album wouldn't be 
compfeic without some of their 
classic surf instrumentals like 
"Party Pants." All you need is 
Gidgct dancing on a surfboard 
to make this song flawless. 

The next three tracks are 
from Iheir 1999 release "A 11 



Sex Shop Employee." The title 
track from tfiat record is a drum- 
driven, powerful rock song 
about the perils of working in a 
sen shop. "IDTs" really displays 
their distinct surf punk sound 
with a clean guitar solo. Ne.il is 
"Coverband.' a melodic ballad 
about a has-been rock star. 

From the Patty Duke 
Fanzine connpilation 13 comes 
"Girl is a Girl." It's hard to 
tielieve tliat an en-Queer and an 
evSmcar play on this pop song. 
Regardless, it somehoiv flows 
with the whole anthology. 

"Dead Go Getter," from 
un released eight- track demos, 
exhibits Kay's humor with a 
doleful ballad. Also from the 
unreleased tracks is "Purple 
Knife," which made its wav 
onto the Beautys' second full- 
length album. It's another surf- 
dnvHi instrumental demonstrating 
Kay's diverse guitar playing.

From an unreleased demo 
recorded in 1999, "Jackson" 
proves that you can't go wrong 
with some good old rock and 
roll rilfs and dueling male- 
female vocals. 

The last four tracks were 
recorded live and they really 
show off Kay's onstage wil. 



They also prove that the Beautys 
are a remarkable live net.

Importance and risks of antibiotic use and misuse 



It's that time of the )»ar 
again. Colds, flu, bronchitis, 
strep throat, pneumonia and 
other respiratory ailments are on 
the horizon. With winter in full 



fore 



e you 



robab!)' see your doctor 
because you have "caught one 
of those bugs," 

If you are diagnosed with a 
bacterial illness such as strep 
throat or bacterial pneumonia, 
your physician will most likely 
prescribe antibiotic therapy lor 
(or the illness. Have you ever 
missed doses or not finished the 



prescription? There is a very 

food reason that you need to 
inish the prescribed dose of 
antibiotic therapy. 

If you slop taking your 
antibiotic on dav five because 
you feel better, the antibiotic is 
not kilting all of the bacleria that 
have invaded your body, 
liutead. you are possibly causing 
■he bacteria to acquire a resist- 
ance to the original antibiotic 
that was prescribed. The impor- 
tant thing is take your pills. 

What usually happens is 
repeated. You begin to feel betler. 
Vou stop taking your antibiotic, 
and then you start to feel like 
you are catching the same buR 



all over again. 

In reality, you were never 
"cured" of the original bacleria. If 
this cycle continues, these par- 
ticular bacteria now have built 
up a resistance against the origi- 
nal antibiotic. Now your 
doctor has to 
prescribe a stronger antibiotic 
because Ihe bacteria are back 
wilh stronger force and have 
created a more vigorous strain. 

This vicious cycle of not 
finishing your prescription and 
getting sick can lead to an infection 
called methicillin-resislant 
staphylococcus aureus. Medical 
experts warn that this organism 
can develop into a condition 



that can be fatal. It produces 
toxins that can cause toxic shock 

A study published in the 
louma! of American Medical 
Association found that infections 
caused by MRSA are increasing 
in adults and children. 

There arc few antibiotics on 
the market thai will kill the 
MRSA bacteria. When a person 
acquires MRSA, Ihe person is 
treated with a potent antibiotic 
called vancomycin. 

Tfiis antibiotic is very expen- 
sive, can be toxic, has many side 
effects and has to be given 
intravenously- Physician 
researchers associated wilh the 



Centers of Disease Control and 
Prevention emphasize that van- 
comycin has been the only con- 
sistently effective treatment for 
staphylococcal infections. 

Even with vancomycin treat- 
ment, the patient can acquire 
vanco- resist ant MRSA, leaving 
the person with a weak immune 
system that is unable to light 
those strains of bacleria. 

Compliance with your 
doctor's orders is important. 
This year, as winter continues 
and you are "down and out with 
the bug," lake your doctor's 
advice: rest, drink plenty of 
fluids and take all of your 
antibiotic. 



By doing this, you arc sav- 
ing yourself from developing 
antibiotic resistance, as well as 
the added expense of purchasing 
another "round" of aniibiotics 
when you start to feel the bug 
coming on again. 

The key thing to remember 
when prescribed an antibiotic is 
don't misuse them. Don't use 
left over antibiotics from a 
previous illness. 

Make sure you lake the 
pills at the same time every day. 
Finish your prescription, and 
don't ask the doctor (or an 
antibiotic if your illness is 
caused by a virus instead of a 
bacteria.

Mastodons push winning streak to three 



It's sUrling !□ become a 
Irend lor Ihc fPFW women's 
basketball leani. 

Build a double-digit lead. 
Lose thai lead. Roily to a victory. 
Whatever worU nghl? 

It worked for the third 
slraigfit lime Salurdav as the 
Mastodons defeated Lipscomb 
88-73 at Ihe Gates Cenler, 

The Dons led by as many as 
16 points in the first half, and 
held a ninc-poinl advantage a I 
haldime. By Ihc 15:18 mark in 
Ihe second half, though, the 
store was tied at 48-48, and less 
Ihan two minutes later, the 
Bisons were ahead by two on a 
jumper by Monica Blako. 



said IPFVV coach Bruce 
Pallorson, "Once we picked it 
back up, I thought we pretty 
much controlled it," 

The lead traded hands two 
more limes before IPFW went 
ahead for good following a pair 
of free throws by Maggie 
Bniening with 8:34 to play. 
Baskets by Amy Gearlds, Verea 
Bibbs, Couilney Nicley and 
Bruening cjuickly built the IPFW 
lead back to 11 paints with 5:42 
an the clock. 

"I was telling myself 'don't 
quil.' That's the last thing you 
need to do," Gearlds said. 
"Especially when you have the 
lead and you get behind, there's 
no rca.Min to quit because you 



know you can beat this t 

IPFW (6-15) was led by 
Gearlds with 22 points, five 
rebounds and four steals, while 
three other Mastodons scored 
nine points or more. Bmening 
finished with 19 points, eight 
boards, eighl assists and steals, 
and Nicley had 16 points and 
five rebounds. Bibbs had IQ 
points and live boards, while 
Lindy Carey added nirie points 
and six rebounds. 

Also for Ihe third consecutive 
game. IPFW committed just 15 
turnovers. And although 
Patterson was pleased with that 
statistic, he felt most of Ihe 
turnovers were unforced. 

"1 don't Ihink the turnovers 
had anything to do with them." 
he said, "Most of c " " " 



happened simply 'becau__ 
didn't focus, so we made a few 
mistaVes. but 15 turnovers is a 
nice numljer. If ivc can slay near 
that number, we're going lo beat 
a lot of teams." 

Because IPFW is an NCAA 
independent and is not part of a 
conlen.'nce. Ihe Dons decided to 
approach Iheiricmoimngsdiedule 
(oUowing the Cleveland Stale 
game on fan. 22 as their "conference 
schedule," The Mastodons have 
not been beaten since, 

"One of the things Ihat 
Coach talked to us about before 
the game was that we were 
going to be the first Division 1 
iPnv learn lo go 3-0 [in Ihcir 
conference] besides the men's 
volleyball learn," Gearlds said. 
"It (eeLs great to be Ihat."

Dons split with Dalhousie 



Just watching IPBV battle 
Dalhousie Friday and Saturday, one 
probably wouldn't have guessed 
the matches were little more than 
praclicc for the Mnslodons. 

Bolh matches werit lo Ihe 
maximum of live games. The 
Dons won Friday's 28-30. 30-18, 
19-30. 30-19 and 18-16. The 
Tigers bounced back Saturday, 
defeatmg IPFVV 30-28, 24-30. 28- 
30. 30-18 and 15-13, 

Because Dalhousie is in 
Nova Scotia, Canada, the matches 
will not count on IPFW's NCAA 
record, and the Dons approached 
the matches much like practice 
scrimmages. 

NCAA record, so it's a couple 
matches that we can play and 
just gel belter, so that's what it's 
all about," IPRV coach Amie Ball 
said. "VVhen you get to play good 
teams and get Ihem on videotape, 
you can teach the kids some 
things they need to work on." 

Dalhousie's season began 
in November, while the Dons 
did not take Ihe court until mid- 
January. Ball fell playing the 
more-experienced Tigers would 
benefit his team. 

"They've only got two weeks 



lefl until Ihcy go lo their pbyolfs, 
so they're way ahead of us." he 
said. "No douDt it's good for us lo 
play those types of Icams." 

Immediately following 
Saluiday's loss, the veteran coach 
was foi:usir\E on airas where his 
team was solid and where it could 

"1 certamly think their middle 
attack was better than ours, and 
theirbackcouit defense was better 
than ours," he said. "1 though! 
our blocking was belter than 
theirs, and we have more diversitj' 
in our olfense than they do. So 
they're two different kinds of 
teams, but Ihe score ended up 
being close anyhow. ' 

On Friday. IPFW was led by 
)eff Ptak and Mall Zbyszewstii 
with 20 kills apiece. Areangel 
Kuiz finished with 12 kills, II 
digs and three aces. Rhyen 
Slaley also had 11 digs, and 
Serdar Sikca added seven 
blocks. Dennis Santiago finished 
with 58 assists and eight blocks. 

Ptak led Ihe Doru again 
Saturday with 29 kills and nine 
digs. Zoyszewski had 16 kills 
and six digs, while Ruiz finished 
with 12 kills and seven blocks. 
Angel Ruiz-Rivera added 11 
kills and five digs, while

To err is human, but chocolate is divine 

A review of Fort Wayne's best cocoa bean artists 



EJjIor 

I'm not claiming to know 
the ins and outs of chocolate. I'm 
not claiming to know the correct 
ratio of cocoa lo milk that 
should be used in onier lo make 

Perfect chocolale. I do know this: 
like chocolate, and ai certain 
timesof themonth, I find myself 
consuming mass quantities of it. 

assignment thai 1 realized that 
not all chocolates an; Ihe same. 

I ventured out and bought 
plain milk chocolate candy from 
Fannie May (a popular chocolate 
establishment based in Chicago, 
convcnienlly located in 
Clenbrook). Codiva (from 
Marshall Field's), Abby Brown's 
(located on State Street) and 
DeBrand (on Coldwater Road). I 
also bought dark chocolate from 
DeBrand and Fannie May and 
'^— ngo Mint Chocolate from 



Field'^s. 



1 based my re 






itiy say that when it 
came 10 plain milk chocolate, 
DeBrand was by far Ihe best! 
Their chocolate was veiy 
creamy, practically melting in 
my mouth, and hardly had a 
waxy taste. The chcKolale had a 
healthy balance of sugar and 

On a scale of one lo 10, I 
gave DeBrand a nine. Their 
diocolale was eiceUent. but a little 
pricey. But for a quality gift for 
your significant olher, should 
cost really be a factor? 

So, say cost does mean 
something to you, but you still 
wanl cjualily. Then your best 
choice is going lo be chocolate 



from Fannie May. While the 
chocolate isn't as flavorful as 
DeBrand. it is decent chocolate 
and much belter than Ihe others. 
All in all. I ranked Fannie May a 

Ranking nest, ivith a middle- 
of-the-road five, was Godiva. 
This chocolate was a liltle wany. 
but creamy at the same time. 
The one big drawback was the 
constant vanilla flavor thalover- 

Sowercd any sorl of chocolate 
avor Ihis candy might have. 
After a while, I founo it rather 
repulsive and didn't even allow 
adequate lime for it to melt in 
my mouth because I just wanted 
to get rid of the constant vanilla 
Ravor. But 1 did have to give it a 
higher rank than others because 
il was creamy and not too waxy 

Next on my review ranking 
comes Abby Brown's milk 
chocolate. The only chocolate 
worse than Ihis was Hershey's. 
II wasn't very creamy and was 
rather w.ny. II didn't have a 
strong enough chocolalc flavor, 
or even a sweet flavor for that 
matter. Compared to DeBrand 
and Fannie May chocolates, 
Abby Brown's chocolate didn't 
impress me al all. In the rank of 
things. 1 gave Abby Brown's a 
Ihree. 

Lasl. but nol least, is Ihe 
ever-popular Hcrshey bar, 
which ranked a two. This candy 
bar was so filled with sugar Ihal 
it lacked any sort of chocolate 
flavor. They should actually 
rewrite the package and say 
Hershey's Sugar Bar. 

If you even look at the list 
of ingredients, il may list milk 
chocolate as the first ingredi- 
ent, but it is. in actuality, 
milk chocolate wilh sugar. 

When il came to dark 
chocolate, the Fannie May 




Company has this one mastered 
and blew out Ihe competition. 
Even before the candy was 
opened. I couJd smell Ihe cocoa. 

The candy had a rich and 
deep chocolate taste that didn't 
have loo much bile. 

It was very smooth and 
creamy and lacked the waxy fla- 
vor that was found in the milk 
chocolate bar. DeBrand 's dark 
diocolale ivasn't too bad. but still 
didn'l have the powerful cocoa 
flavor like Farmie May's did. 

By far Ihe absolute best was 
the Frango Mint Chocolate Bar 
found at Marshall Field's. II was 
the creamiest, smoothest, richest 
and most flavorful of all the 
other diocolales. 

Tic mint flavor accented the 



chocolate flavor and didn't 
overpower it like the vanilla 
did in. the Godiva chocolate. II 
was also very eosi efficient, 
The chocolate bar was SI .50 
and they also had boxed 
chocolates which were less 
expensive than the other 
chocolate establishments.

The Communicator 



Mars: 



To me, Ihc ideal 

Valentine's Day dale begins 
wilh giving someone a 
thoughlful gifl. White a to! 
of people maydread In^ng 
to come up with a gift for 
someone for Valentine's 
day. I kind of think of il as a 
challenge! I try to think □( 
something Ihat my 
girlfriend would never 
eipccl. Altec all. il seems lo 
me thai women love gelling 
flowers everyday BUT 
Valentine's Day. For example, 
one year I gave my fiance a 
door knocker with our 
names engr.ived on it so we 
could pul on our first 
house (which is now on our 
front door). Another year 1 
gave hcf a picture (rame 
wilh four pictures in it. 
Two of the photos were of 
us. one was of me when I 
was a kid and one of the 
pictures was of her when 




Mars and Venus, 

"What is your ideal Valentine's Date?" 




she was a kid, t had gotten 
the photo from her parents 
without her knowing. [ 
think that a thoughtful gift 
is Ihe best way lo starl out a 
great Valentine's Day. 

An ideal Valentine's Day 
evening is.a simple one, in 
my opinion. 1 like lo just 
rent some movies (maybe 
Ihe one Ihat you watcncd 
on your firsl dale) make a 
nice dinner, drink some 
wine (only if you're of age, 
of course!) and do lots of... 
umm — cuddling. Yeah, 
cuddling, Ihal's the ticket! 

I think that the worst 
Valentine's Days are Ihe 
ones thai are nothing but 
corporate. Roses. Hallmark 
cards. Dinner. Movie. 
Anything special should 
involve a lillle creativity 
and though I. 




For women: alternatives to bitterness 



[ hale it when people describe single 
women wilh the lenii "biller." 1 am not 
saying thai some single women don't harbor 
feelings of billemess al limes — 
Valentine's Day in particular — but I 
think thai il is a mistake lo assume that 
ALL single women are bitter. Many are 
simply "opiimism free" when il comes lo 
men and relationships 

And why shouldn't Ihey be? 
Although cultural evolution has begun to 
narrow the disparity behveen perceptions 
of single men and single women {Ihe 
playboy and Ihe spinster), there is new 
evidence Ihat we naven'l come such "a 
long way. baby." 

For instance, just when a television 
network balanced the reality show gender 
gap by having a bachelorette use Ihe same 
demeaning process lo choose her (so- 
called) soul mate, anolher network airs a 
similar show with a new bachelor — 
except this lime they are deceiving the 
single gals inio believing thai the man is a 

n. Isn't Ihis basically a super-sized 



and veg with a movie, don't watch some 
sappy love slory. Rent "Thelma and 
Louise" or "Beaches" for a heavy dose of 

firl power, (No. that Spice Girls movie 
oes NOT count.) 

As a matter of fact, make il a parly. 
Then, after the movie you can all 



dumped you and guys you should have 
dumped. If misery loves company, then 
make it a crowd. Make margaritas' 

For those who ace into self-help 
books, there's a great one titled "Why 
There Are No Good Men Uft: The 
Romanlic Plighl of the New Single 
Woman" by Barbara Da foe Whitehead. 

This book discusses the difficulties 

cultural changes in the last 30 years and 
examines solutions for modem dating. 
Amazon.com readers gave il four and a 
half slars, and Ihe reader rcvictvs were 
excel ten I. 

I have to admil that thi 



be "man free" any lime. 

The key word here is "free" as in 
"freedom" — something a lelalionship 
offers in limited quantities. Most 
importantly, if you are still agonizing over 
your single lifestyle, remernbcr Ihat it is 
far, far better lo be atone than lo be witfi 
and wish you were alone.

model in the sample pholo Ihal came with 

a waltel? Here's an idea: Next lime, pick a 

guy to be the "millionaire" who looks less 

tike Peter Gallagher and more like Steve 

Buscemi. 

Admitlcdly, I am not a single woman — 
I am virtually a newlywed. But I do 
remember feeling "opiimism free" at 
various points in my dating life. Plus, I 
have several single female friends who

So what ace single women to do on a 
traditionally "couples" holiday like 
Valentine's Day? A typical option for 
Valentine's Day is (or single gals lo hook 
up with other romantic malcontents and 
enjoy a night oul. Dress up and go out to 
a reslaurani lor a nice dinner. Or, skip a 
chocolate calorie lesl (and resullmg 
insulin shock), go to a club, shake your 
groove thane wilh friends and release 
those endorphins productively. 

But, if you are dying to slay home 



optimism&lt;liallenged and reading . 
or watching a movie will simply not 
alleviate their anger, frustration and 
well... billemess. While 1 don'l condone 
violence, 1 will make Iwo suggestions. 

First, take somelhing Ihat an ex- 
boyfriend gave you and break il, shred it 
or mangle il in some manner Avoid 
breaking laws or fire codes. 

Second, if you are so hateful about 
Ihe entire Valentine's holiday Ihat ALL 
couples make you feel homicidal, this 



this.) Dress up in your holiest outfit, get 
your nails done and your hair "did," Then 

smiling and cooing lo each other, walk up 
to the man and say the following. "VVhecc 
have you been? Why didn't you call me? 
What was I lo you? Just a one-nighl 
slandT"Then storm oul. Let him deal with 
Ihe afteimalh. No guilt — just remind 
yourself that he was probably going lo be 
a creep to her anyivay. y\nd. since you're 
looking great, go out and flirt shamelessly 
wilh whomever you want. 

IVhile these options may or may not 
work for some single women, there are 
some basic truths these gals should 
remember: You arc nol alone. It is okay to 
be "opiimism free" at limes. It is okay lo 



Things not to give 
for Valentine's Day 



Some people have an innate sensi 
lor finding a Ihoughtlul gift lor Ihei 
partner. This skill requires a lillle thing 
nlled empathy — a sense Ihat allows 
, ou to envision Ihe world beyond 
yourself and become aware of (and care) 
how others feel. 

This leaves me at a disadvantage, 

idering thai 1 don't fiave such a luxury 
on more Ihan one occasion, have 
single-handedly destroyed relationships 
because of it. Draiving from personal 
experience, I will tell you men what 
NOT lo gel your loved ones for 
Valentine's Day, 

Here il goes, from lop lo bollom. the 
Imst serious offense lo the greatest. 

1, A make-up chesb Nothing says "I 
love you" more than an item Ihat gives 
the unintentional message of "You could 
be pretber so I got you Ihis big box of 
skanky clown painl. 

2, A condom in a sleazy card: 1 saw 
friend do this and let's just say that the 

condom was never used. 1 guess il gives 
her the idea Dial he is actually saying, 
Happy Valentine's dav lo ME " 

3, A hearl-shapecf Pez dispenser I 
did Ihis m my junior year of high school. 
I got her this, and she got me a large box 
ofchocolalcs, tivo roses (one from some 
other guy) and a teddy bear She w: 



have been a less painful allemaliv 

If you are a guy who thinks Ihese 

good gifts, then I can honestly say 

u're screwed" and you should ask a 

friend of hers for an idea. Have a happy 

(and not lonely) Valentine's Day! 



Venus: 



Blah to traditional 
Valentine's Day eventsi The 
longevity of a relationship can 
be pre-determined by Ihe 
success of Feb. U! Boys. I'm 
telling you, without a htlle 
charm and crealivity, you're 
just another V-Day date gone 
wrong! So, I've been solo for 
the past Iwo years on 
Valentine's Day, and I've had 
plenty of time lo think about 
what I would love to have 
happen. 1 agree, the typical 






)uld love ti 



svould be great, but not enough 
— sorry it's not Ihat easy' I 
don'l need to be wined and 
dined on Valentine's Day. [ 
want my guy to take me 
somewhere fun' Here's how 
my day tvould go (if I had a 
date!): My valentine would 
pick me up (because we both 
took Ihe day off work, of 
couisc!). and we would toad trip 
for the lu^t. I would love it if my 
guy could make all the plans 
and just take me somewhere so 
we could spend lime together, 
alone. I don't need flowers or 
chocolate. Well, okay, maybe I 
do need chocolate, but axe the 
flowers, and jusl lake me some- 
where we can just hang oul and 
have (un relaxing together! 

Honestly bo)^, gifts aren't 

remember lo al least gel a card. 
Girls like to hold on lo those 
and if she doesn't have one 
from Valentine's Day 2003, 
she's not going to be happy! 
Believe me! Try lo be a lilltc 
musliier Ihan usual on V-Day, 
Telling us how great we look 
and how pcrlecl we are for you 



that whole day! That alone makes us melt! 

Why is V-day so important? 

By Dan Vance day Ihe pilgrims landed al 

Mamsina Edilar Plymouth, that's a holiday. 

Chrislmas, Ihe day of Ihe birth of 
Christ, that's a holiday. Rosh 
Hashanah, Easter. Arbor Day, each 
more of a holiday than Valentine's 
Day. All Feb, H represents is an 
love Ihal, overall, is ac hi ally rare in 
the world, h is an artificial holiday 
Ihat was made lo help sell more 
candy, flowers and cheesy greeting 
cards. Baseball stadiums now have 
sponsors so why can't Ihe arlificial 
holidays like this have them? Why 
don'l we just slart lo refer to Feb. 
14 as Hallmark Valentine's Day? It 
would make sense. 

Now, I'm sure thai for every 
person like me ivho mostly despises 
Valentine's Day. Ihere arc single 
men who cherish il and wish that 
Ihey had someone special in their 
lives. Hey, I was like thai al one 

60 int. More power to those people. 
ut looking back on last year. I 
realized Ihal the day was over- 
hyped. 

So for all you single guys, 
think about il for a while. Last year, 
1 spent who knoivs how much 
money on flowers, candy; a Icddy 
bear and a sappy (and somewhat 

ralhelic) card. Money. 1 might add, 
really didn't have lo spend. Now 
1 have nobody, and I also hav 



Bitter is such an ugly term. 
Like women, single men are also 
quite often considered biller. But 
you know what? In Ihis case, 
they're right. You bet I'm bitter, I 
always have been and I always will 
be. Even when I'm not single. I'm 
biller, Bui the fact that I will be single 
this Valentine's Day, like most oth- 
ers in my life, heightens my 
billemess in some regards, 

Bui my billemess comes from 
a different approach. See, 1 can live 
without having a girlfriend on 
Valentine's Day — it^ nol the end 
of Ihe world. In reality, last year 
was Ihe only year in the 18 of my 
life thai 1 had a girlfriend. So 
obviously. 1 can live wilhout one. 

My billemess comes from 
many things, including the pure 
vomil-evokinc fad of seeing two 
other people shanng this day. Keep 
il in your o(vn houses and keep the 
blinds closed, 1 don't wont lo see it. 
Granted, public displays of affection 
lake place on other days loo, but on 
Feb, 14. all Ihe candy hearts, roses 
and teddy bears used as added 

So wilh all of that said, what is 
there to do on the most bile extracting 
holiday fgr a single, quite possibly 
bitter male? For me, it will simply 
be anolher day, I will get up al 7:30 
a.m. and take a shower. I'll grab 
some breakfast and head from 
home to campus lo catch my 
criminal justice class al nine, Hien 
I'll go lo sociology, eal lunch and 
go lo my writing for mass media 
class. From there. I will go home 
and most likely sleep for a few 
hours, gel up, eat dinner, watch 
television and go back lo bed. No 
big difference for me. Same stuff, 
different day, 1 figure, why get all 
worked up over a holiday Ihat 
doesn'l mean anything to me at all? 

While 1 am on Ihis subject 
(kinda), what makes Valentine's 
Day a holiday? Independence Day, 
Ihc day Ihal America became free 
and gained our independence, 
that's a holiday. Thanksgiving, the 



last February, Also, if hitting the 
town rather than sleeping is your 
thing, then you're set. If you plan 
to go out on Feb, 14 wilh friends or 
whatever, you don't have to worry 
about being held down. You can be 
fm? to do whatever il is that you do. 

allachmeni on this day is one of 
those great things about being 
male. While single women might 
watch their chick-flicks and eat 
candy all night, we don't have lo be 
down and out. Being carefree is the 
best part. You can be bitter like me
