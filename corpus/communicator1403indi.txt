said there was enough Inlercst to bring 
some programs on campus, "for Ihe 
relative convenience of students." 

Major David Nelson, prolcssor of 
military science, said he could see 
IPFW as an ROTC host school o "lew 
years down Ihe rood " But Insisted that 
the main objective of the HOTC U to 
offer additional courses tor students 

"All we try In do Is provide an op- 
tion," sold Nelson. "We provide ad- 
ditional education." 

Julius Smulkslys. dean of aria and 
letters, the deportment under which the 
HOTC is housed said grealer visibility 
is what the ROTC is after. 

"The general goal, or major thrust, ol 
Ihe revision ol the existing agreemenl 
Is to make Ihe ROTC program more 
visible on campus and to make in- 
formation more accessable lo 
students," said Smutkstys 

The "revision of the existing 
agreement" thai Smulkatys speaks of 
could probably be more accurately 
described as a counteraction lo the 
existing agreement. 

For e»ample, the im ITT agreemenl 
spcdllcolly stales: 

■'There will be no marching, showing 
of arms, mandatory wearing of 
uniforms, or public m Hilary demon- 
strations on the IUPUFW (IPFW) 
campus 

The Ball Slate agreement, however, 
counteracts the ITT provision by in- 
cluding provisions ol its own that 
require'

which, according lo Nelson, consists of 



Falrchlld agreed that cadets would 
eventually become accuslomed to 
wearing Ihe uniforms, but said Ihere 
was also a "flip side" lo wearing one. 

"They (ROTC) would be the only 
group on campus who would wear the 
uniforms full-time," Falrchlld said. 
"As a highly visible minority, they 
may Creole some antipathy (among 
other students), and the tendency is to

In the case of Kathleen Brila, a

into the bank, and he'd keep the 
children as hostages. She refused 
vehemently, even when Elam put the 
gun to her head. Reflecting back now 
that she knows that Elam was on drugs 
si the time, she says she doesn't know If 
the could have refused so boldly But 
finally, Elam allowed her to take ihree

Ihe children relumed to the car. The

previously came to her car pretending 
to ask directions. He proceeded to force 
his way Into ihe back seat of the car 
where two of the children were seated. 
"This is a holdup, and you're doing 
Ihe driving." he said, pulling oul a gun . 

The abductor, Larry Elam. 
demanded that Mrs. Brila drive lo her 
bank and withdraw all the money from 
her savings account. "You better have 
at least two thousand dollars." he said. 

Mrs. Brila drove to the bank Ihinking

managed it. One of the tellers noticed 
her anxiety and terror. Mrs. Brita told 
her the problem but didn't want her to 
call Ihe police. She handed Ihe children 
one by one over the teller's window so 
they would be safe. Then, accompanied 
by some marked bills and a bank 
executive. Thomas Talro. Mrs. Brita 
went back to her car. 

They drove for about one mile lo a 
vacant narking lot where Elam look the 
keys, jumped oul of Ihc cor and storied

the police The ordeal was aver, or

accept Elam's plea bargaining. Elam is 
currently serving twenty years in 
Wcslville Correction Cenler lor armed 
robbery, but he Is receiving no punish- 
ment for the kidnapping. 

Now, six years after Ihe event. Mrs. 
Brita's story, colled "This is a Hold- 
Up!" is appearing in the September 
issue of "Ladles Home Journal" in a 
continuing series of stories called "It's 
Nat Easy To Be A Woman Today." 

The idea of writing the story for 
publication came to Mrs. Brila while 
taking an Intermediate Expository 
Writing class here at IPFW Her In- 
structor, Joan Montgomery, en- 
couraged her to try to get something 
published after reading Just four or five 
of her assignments. When Mrs. Brita 
told her ins true lor about Ihe kid- 
napping, she was laid that writing Ihe 
story would be therapeutic, thai It 
would help her lo accept Hie experience 
and put II behind her. And to Mrs. 
Brila's surprise, the Lhcrapy worked. 

She followed Joan Montgomery's 
instrue lions and Ihe ins I rue lions of 
"Writer's Market," a guide lo gelling 
something published She sent a letter 
of inquiry lo "Ladies' Home Journal," 

phone call telling af Ihe mogaiine's 
interest In Ihe story. All Ihe lime that 
Mrs. Brita worked on the Story, the 
"Ladies' Homo Journal" kept in close 
contact, phoning her three limes per

own style. 

In addition 10 appearing in Ihe 
"Ladies' Home Journal." Mrs Brllo's 
story will air on a nationally syndicated 
radio show on September 8. 1SH. 

Since the success of Mrs Brila's 
published story, her main goal is to gel 
other things published She is currently 
working from experience on a story 
about a re-entry sludcnl, and she hopes 
lo wrllc a children's book 

A strange event led lo Mrs. Brita's 
final acceptance of her kidnapping A 
reverend asked Mrs Brila for her 
impression of Elam because he thought 
Elam should be institutionalized In- 
stead of Incarcerated. Mrs. Brila told 
the reverend that she had Ihoughl him

Damage being repaired 

Carnaghi: IPFW could 
receive flood aid soon 



Most people would like lo forget the 
"Flood of '»." 

Unfortunately, many reminders are 
'till evident, especially Ihose faced by 
the IPFW administration, which is slill 
going through the long drawn oul 
process of procuring federal funds to 
repair the March flood damage to the 
Helmkc Library and Waib Memorial 

Some aid, however, could be 
available in a matter of weeks, ac- 
cording to John Camoghl. vice chan- 
cellor for Financial Affairs 

Last April. Ihe Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) 
estimated IPFW's damage lo run

cent, or 1)63,000, of that amounL 

FEMA said it will send IPFW a check 
worth W.aTS (half of llSS.TSOl In a few 
weeks, Carnaghi said, but dilficullles 
could delay II further 

'We have every expectation It will be 
coming, but who knows what could 
happen 1 "Carnaghi sold "We expected 
a check last April. That was four 
months ago " 

FEMA will send IPFW Ihe 



all when IPFW can prove it used the 
noney lor its inlended purpose, Car- 
aghi said. "We have lo show them that

FEMA said it will pay IS percent of

making sewer corrections. Carnaghi 
said Most of the damage was caused by 
water thai backed up Into the sanitary 
and storm sewers by the leveling of the 
St. Joseph River. 

Right now. FEMA and Purdue West

a way to fix the sewers, Carnaghi ad-

"It came down lo a point of how to fix

about the next major flood.' Purdue 
said, 'We're worried aboul any major

Even though FEMA and West 
Lafayette disagreed during the sum- 
mer. Carnaghi said the two are very 
close to o compromise at this time.
