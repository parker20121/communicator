Celebrating Black 
History Month 

Multicultural Services, Black Collegian Caucus, 
co-sponsors of local events with WBNI-89. 1 FM

By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Although February is the short- 
est month of tin. year, ii is full of 
evenLs that help commemorate the 
creation of America's heritage. 

February is Black History 
Month, and in light of thai, the 
Black Collegian Caucus, the Office 
of Multicultural Services and 
WBNI-89. 1 FM. 
have all sponsored 
or co-sponsored 
various events to 
aid in fostering 
awareness of 
African-Ameri- 
can culture and 
history 

Heightened 
awareness is one 
ihing that BCC 
President Lynclte 
Lewis would like 
to see happen. 

The aware- 
ness should he all 
year, not just one 
month, she said 

The BCC was 
the sole sponsor of 
the musical tribute 
that took place on 
Feb. 7 

The bulk of 
the remaining 
events will be 
sponsored by 
Multicultural 
Services and/or 
WBNI 

Sponsoring 
the musical tribute 
was important to 
Lewis 

"The musical put a different 
spin on Black History Month," she 
said. 

As far as WBNI's contribution 
to Black History Month, the station 
is proud to have sponsored radio 
programs to commemorate Black 
History Month for at least 10 years 

The station has also become 
increasingly involved with other 



community groups, such as IPFW's 
Multicultural Services, which it has 
worked with for six years. 

Janice Furtner. Music Director 
at WBNI, fceLs thai Black History 
Month is a time worthy of celebra- 
tion. 

"From a musical standpoint, a 
unique contribution has been 
made," Furtner said. 

She echoes Lewis' sentiments 
about how the contributions of 
African Americans have been over- 
looked except for once a year. 

" I l 
seems unfortu- 
nate that these 
programs and 
songs are only 
seen and beard 
during February." 
says Furtner

grams to air

to Furtner, some 
of the programs 
return year after 
year. 

She adds. 
"We will continue 
to get involved." 
As with 
all campus events, those events 
sponsored by BCC and/or the Office 
of Multicultural Services deserve 
support 

"Last year, mosdy (he commu-

said. 

"I would like to see more stu-

Diversity Week photo contest 



By Nol Beckley 

Editor 



Although the faculty decided 
an evaluation of chancellor 
Wartell would not be prudent at 
this time, they did send a strong 
message to the faculty senaie to 
enforce a six-year-old measure 
that set up guidelines for an 
administrative evaluation at 
Monday's faculty convocation. 

The evaluation question was 
asked in a resolution put fortb by 
several professors. 

The same professors were ihe 
ones who circulated the petition 
to call a faculty convocation Al 
least 59 members or 20 percent of 
the 294 voting faculty had to sign 
the pcution to call ihe convoca- 
tion. 

Several members of the facul- 
ty were against the original reso- 
lution which called for the evalu- 
ation because it would publicize 
the results. 

"We would be holding the 
administration io a different stan- 
dard than we have." said Frank 
Paladino. chair and professor of 
biology. Student evaluations of 
faculty are not published. 

Mike Downs, chair and asso- 
ciate professor of political sci- 



ence, said he neither opposed nor 
supported the resolution. 

He said he was concerned 
with what the evaluation would 
create. 

"1 don't think it would direct- 
ly provide us with solutions." 
Downs said. He also said that the 
conditions are right for an evalua- 
tion 

Paladino said he thought the 
administrative evaluation had the 
"underlying current of trying io 
embarrass the central administra- 
tion." 

He also said he would encour- 
age open lines of communication 
before issues became incendi- 
ary." 

"It would be an enormous 
mistake to conduct an opinion 
poll' at this time." said Steve 
Hollander, assistant professor of 
English and linguistics. 

Other faculty members 
echoed Paladino's words about 
communications among the facul- 

iy- 

"I really believe we've for- 
gotten bow to disagree." said 
William Bruening, professor of 
philosophy. 

Jeffrey Wilson, professor of 
psychological sciences, said be 
wasn't sure if what he had been 
bearing in the press were the loud 



complaints of a minority or the 
strong murmurs of the great 
majority. 

"We have a role Io play in the 
governance of this university . . 
We need io know our collective 
voice," said Peter ladicola. asso- 
ciate professor of sociology and 
anthropology, 

Michael Nusbaumer, associ- 
ate professor of sociology and 
anthropology and one of profes- 
sors who circulated the petition, 
said he was concerned about peo- 
ple claiming to speak for the 
whole faculty when the faculty 
has not spoken collectively. 

"I'm concerned we've done 
little to clear the air," Nusbaumer 
said. 

Faculty who spoke at the con- 
vocation were divided on several 
issues 

Richard Manalis, associate 
professor of biology, said the pub- 
he i. ... 1. 1.. hi among the faculty 
has caused four problems: It has 
decreased faculty morale; it has 
decreased the ouusidc perception 
of the university; it docs not 
impress members of state govern- 
ment and it has polarized (he 
administration and the faculty. 

Some said they did not feel 
there was enough lime io formu- 
late a proper evaluative 



instrument. 

The faculty did decide to 
encourage the faculty senate to 
enforce a six-year-old measure 
setting up guidelines to evaluate 
members of the administration 
and also to meet two more times 
before Spring Break to discuss 
collcgiality, freedom of expres- 
sion, allocation of resources and 
(he effectiveness of IPFW acade- 
mic leadership 

The faculty also approved of 
a committee consisting of four 
faculty chosen by mutual agree- 
ment of the chancellor and facul- 
ly senate to mediate disputes 
between the administration and 
faculty. 

The faculty will meet on Feb. 
23 to discuss collegiality and free- 
dom of expression and will meet 
again on March 2 to discuss allo- 
cation of resources and the effec- 
tiveness of IPFW academic lead- 
ership 

Chancellor Wartell and sever- 
al other members of the adminis- 
tration also attended the meeting 

Others attending the meeting 
included representatives from 
three local television stations and 
the Journal Gazette and the News- 
Sentinel

To the Editor: 

The "Faculty petitions to eval- 
uate Wartell" headline in the Feb 
12 Communicator and related 
information in the accompanying 
front-page story are wrong. In their 
petition faculty members suggest- 
ed no evaluation of any administra- 
tor Rather, they identified "a num- 
ber of campus policies and issues" 
they believed merited discussion: 



collegiality; free expression; cam- 
pus funding, especially of faculty 
positions: numbers and salaries of 
administrators; the Purdue griev- 
ance policy; the General Education 
program: re pre sen tali on of IPFW 
within Fort Wayne; and unspeci- 
fied "other campus issues and con- 
cerns." 

The petition identifies no 
administrator, either by name or by 



position, and requests no evalua- 
tion of anyone Some-perhaps 
many-of the faculty who signed 
tbe petition would nol have done so 
had it included a request for such 
an evaluation

To the Editor: 

After reading the editorial a 
couple weeks ago about the hours 
of the bookstore and the cafeteria I 
was relieved. 

It was nice lo know I'm not the 
only one who has encountered 
hardships because of these hours. 

I'm a night student and I come 
straight from work Which makes 
it difficult to find something to eai 
before class It would be nice to be 
able to go to the cafeteria and get 
something to eat and study both 
before my class. 



I think it wouldn't be that 
much trouble for the cafeteria to 
stay open a liltle later to serve the 
night students. 

I have also been in the sttua- 



I have friends at other campus- 
es and they have no problem get- 
ting into their bookstore when they 
need to 

I would think that the book- 
store would realize that since this 
is a commuter campus and many 
of us have jobs during the week 
lhai the weekends are when we 



have time io get lo campus and 
work on our studies. 

I think the bookstore and the 
cafeteria should re-think their pol- 
icy on hours because they are sup- 
pose to be here for us. 

I know (his letter won't change 
anything but I wanted 10 voice my 
opinion.

Okay, so what the bell is the big

We jusi don't get it. 

We aren't sure if players on the

Martin's skills or

have always been 
portrayed to be. 

For those that 
aren't sure what

you up to speed

We believe 
that the PGA with 
its rules and regu- 
lations lost sight of what was at 
stake. With the explosion of Tiger

ties, but tins event has pushed them 
back a few paces.

We feel that the 

PGA has sustained its 

stereotype and has 

failed to break 

through barriers that could lead the 

sport of golf into new frontiers. 

We leave with a few words of 
advice for the PGA, "Sometimes 
you've just gotta say, 'What the

Bulldog gives $$$$ 



Who says no one gets out of Fort 
Wayne or thai not much comes out 
of Fort Wayne? Well, those folks are 
wrong and we have proof. 

Anyone who watches the award- 
winning TV show "Frasier" knows 
who the Bob "Bulldog" Briscoe 
character is, but many don't know 
thai Dan Butler, who plays Bulldog, 
is a Fort Wayne native 

We give Butler a high five for 
nol forgetting his roots. Recently. 
Butler established a $25,000 
endowed scholarship for theatre 



majors at IPFW 

Butler went 10 Northrop High 
School and attended IPFW for a year 
before making the big move out of 
here He was involved in many pro- 
ductions at PIT theatre 

We feel it is outstanding that 
Butler cares enough about IPFW and 
its student body lo help further our 
educational goals We give a huge 
"Thank You" lo Buder for thinking 
about us. waaay back here in 
Indiana. Way to go Dan!! 



Come and

w fiat's Weak this Week.: D 



Everybody who smokes will 
probably die. Yep. that's what the 
good ol' Surgeon General is telling 
us Not that there is anything wrong 
with dying. We all die someday. 
Some of us go early and some go 
late The problem is, does second 
band smoke really effect a non- 
smoker? I'll bet it does I'm not a 
doctor. I just play one on campus. 

Do you have to smoke right at 
the entrance ways of all buddings? I 
don't enjoy coming out of a class and 
inhaling all of the smoke that has 
already damaged your lungs. It does- 
n't seem fair Can you smoke some- 
where else? Does it have to be ten 
smokers huddled at the entrance of 
Kettler? No offense, but smoking 
slinks. 

What makes a person begin to 
smoke? Some children start when 
they are between the ages of ten and 
fifteen Wow, that is really young if 
you ask me. 1 see children smoking 
all of the time I always see some kid 
hitting a cigarette acting like he's 
James Dean or something- Hell, 1 
even see pregnant women smoking 
What is the protocol on something 
like that? Are we supposed to ask 
them to put it out so as not to harm 
the unborn? Or do we let her harm 
the baby and pay for her medical 
expenses after the child is bom 
What do you guys think? 

As teens grow older, smoking is 
everywhere. Movies, television, bill- 
boards, stadiums, race cars, you 
name it This is the problem It is so 
force-fed for kids to smoke, yet we 
still allow it to be seen everywhere. 
Now who do we blame? We look 
cigarette ads off television about 20 
years ago or so and sales never fal- 
tered. Now, we have a billion dollar 
industry killing thousands a month. 
There is even a trophy awarded to 
the points winner in NASCAR called 
the Winston Cup Pretty ironic 

If you go to major sports venues, 
tobacco companies line the bill- 
boards with the Marlboro Man and 
up until lately. Joe Camel You know 
the ads. You see them at baseball and 
football games. And yet, when you 
see these ads in these places, you are 
prohibited from smoking in these 
stadiums. Pretty funny if you ask me. 

Today, prices are reaching over 
two dollars a pack. Two bucks a day 
is almost S800 a year You can buy 
generic smokes for about a buck and 
a half. But. what is generic tobacco? 
Open a magazine and you'll notice 
the target of smokers There are 
brands for women, blacks, tough 
guys, and executives. What is your 
favorite brand? Can men smoke 
Virginia Slims? Would this make 
them less of a man? I don't think so 
But I have NEVER seen a man in an 
ad for thai brand 

Smoking can give people all 
sons of medical problems I don't 
have room for all of them, but look 
at a medical journal and you'll see 
just a few. Yet, we continue 10 
smoke. Smoking also has an additive 
product in it. I'm not sure if it is the 
tar or the nicotine, but it is supposed 
to be really hard to quit. I think there 
is also the psychological aspect of 
having something in your hand or 



mouth all of the time. (Don't be 
sick!) There are people who eventu- 
ally quit smoking; they die 

How can a smoker quit? Lei's 
see. there's gum, patches, hypnosis, 
self-help tapes, or you could just stop 
altogether, it's called Cold Turkey 
How did this expression ever come 
around as a term for quitting some- 
thing? Non-smokers don't under- 
stand how hard it is to actually stop 
Try doing something every day. a 
couple of times a day, for len or so 
years and tell me how easy you think 
it is Kdd a physical need, and there 
you are Weight gain, irritability, 
mood swings and a short attention 
span are only a few symptoms I'm 
telling you it must be very lough 

But let's get back to all of" those" 
that stand outside the buddings at 
school and smoke 1 hope that you 
wdl eventually quit, for our sake Or 
maybe you could stand away from 
the doors like 20 feet or so That 
would at least give us a chance to 
hold our breath It also gets on 
clothes, ask a non-smoker about that 
one I can only make these sugges- 
tions based on what I know You see. 
I am a smoker. That's right. Merit 
regulars I'm not proud of my fellow 
smokers, most of the time because 
they are son of obnoxious. 

I only hope that my smoke does- 
n't bug you I'm not trying to wreck 
your health, I just have a really bad 
habit If you don't like smoke, go 
around us. We more than likely don't 
care about your clean air anyway. I 
can relate to non-smokers. 1 used to 
be one. Speaking of which, I think 
I'll go out and "enjoy" one now 
(cough). 

LOSER OF THE WEEK: Iraq. 
What does It take to convince this 
guy that we arc serious? I'm not in 
favor of innocent people dying, but I 
also don't want to pay two dollars for 
a gallon of gas If you don't support 
air strikes, move to Canada Please 
suppori our men and women, they 
are just trying to do their job Grab 
some beer, make popcorn and get 
ready for Desert Slonn pan II I 
think this lime we need to close the 
deal Who would attend a Iraqi flag 
burning if I held it? I'm sick of 
watching the Stars and Stnpes bum. 



Grads and undergrads in same class 



Thorn In my side: Susan Splndler 



There are some undergrad- 
classes that have grad students 
sprinkled into them. I, personally, 
do not like this idea 

This has occurred in most of 
my English courses here at IPFW 
The class I register for is a 300 
level class, bui there will be grads 
in my class gelling credit for a 500 
or 600 level course, This I don't 
quite understand. 

When I was down on campus, 
this never happened, grads bad 
grad courses and we undergrads 
had ours. 

I understand that the number of 
students are less here, but there 
should be more of a difference 



between the two. 

What gets me is that the main 
difference between my course 
work and the grad students' course 
work seems lo only bod down to a 
paper 

They lake the same exams, 
read the same material, yet they are 
getting graduate level credits based 
on an extra paper. 

Does this mean that if I wnte 
the paper, too. I can get credit for a 
grad class? Sure seems to me thai's 
the way it should work. 

During these classes I have 
talked to other undergrads and 
have found I'm not the only one to 
feel this way. 



Another reason I don t find 
this practice pleasing is thai the 
grad students seem to take over the 
class. 

I can remember a class I took 
last year It was split rather evenly 
between undergrad and grad stu- 
dents 

Continuously throughout the 
semester the discussion was domi- 
nated by the grads. 

If an undergrad wanted to give 
input they were immediatly shot 
down and their opinon shredded. 

Needless to say, I kept my 
mouth shut after witnessing that a 
couple limes. 

Which sucks because pan of 



my grade depended on participa- 
tion But, I'd rather lose a couple 
points than have some smarty grad 
student make me feel like a fool 
because I'm not enthralled with the 
text. 

Please don'l take me wrong 
grad students. I'm not coming 
down on you. 

1 think it's great what you're 
doing and trying to accomplish. 
just do it in your own classes. 

We undergrads are still grasp- 
ing for the basics We may not see 
everything you do. And if you're in 
our classes you should be helping 
us to understand, not ridiculing us 
because we don't. 



Doubting the President 



Do trie matfi: Nol Becfcley 



111 admit it. I was a fan of Bill 
Clinton I voted for him twice. Am 
I proud of that? No. Have I ever 
been proud of voting for Clinton'' 
Not overly proud, but in '92 any 
choad would have been belter than 
George Bush. 

But like in most relationships, 
the time has come to bid farewell to 
my former hberal-loving self (yeah 
nghO and shun Bill Don't worry, 
I'm not gonna stan wearing jack- 
boots and marching to that 
Buchanan/Nazi drummer, but there 
comes a lime to realize that we've 
been hoodwinked, bamboozled, 
etc. 

What really gets my panties in 
a bunch is how. with all the crap 
we've seen Clinton go through, 87 
percent of America can suppon the 
president. I'm abso-freakin-lutely 
floored. Do we want to be lied to? 
Reagan did it and we loved turn 
Bush did ii and we voted him out. 
Clinton lies and still gets more 
action than a Senate page in the 
80s. 

Have our standards dropped so 
low? Why have we not cared about 
his Little- Willie -Gale (also called a 
zipper) being down all the time. 
Isn't it time character mattered 
again? 

Would anyone have the guts to 
tell Lincoln or Teddy Roosevelt 
thai character didn't matter? Why 
can't we send a message to get 
Clinton out? Why don't we care 
that he painted the tonsils of a 21-

year-old iniem? Why don't we care 
that be may have dropped irou in 
front of Paula Jones. 

In Russia, they have a drunk as 
their president, why couldn'l we be 
so lucky 1 We have a lecherous vile 
sexual predator in the most power- 
ful position in the free world (and 
no, thai's not standing over 
Lewinsky). And we don'l give a 
damn about iL 

No one does. The National 
Organization of Women has been 
virtually silent on all matter con- 
cerning the abuse of presidential 
power Were the women of NOW 
ibis slow to mobilize when 
Clarence Thomas found a pubic 
hair in his Coke? Were they this 
slow when Senator Bob Packwood 
was trying to "pack wood?" 

Would NOW be dragging their 
feel like this if Newt Gingrich's 



intern performed oral favors on 
him? They would have been there 
before the iniem would have bad a 
chance (o rinse ber mouth out 1 
thought NOW was dedicated to all 
women, not just the ones persecut- 
ed by the GOP, but also the women 
harassed by the Democrats 

To me the most abhorrent thing 
about this crap is Hillary If she is 
this 90s liberated woman, why ihe 
bell is she just standing by her 
man? Hell, even Tina Turner got 
out of her relationship Hillary said 
she has heard these accusations for 
years and . . and what? If you hear 
something over and over again. 
don'l you begin to sian to wonder? 
Even just a smidgen? If 1 were mar- 
ried (God forbid) and someone lold 
me my wife was getting oral favors 
from someone at work, don't you 
think I would check it out. 



Wouldn't you? What if you beard 
your mate was cheating and you 
beard it for 10 or 12 years, would- 
n't you be just a little suspicious? 

Some people say Hillary just 
wants to stay in power, but at what 
cost? Nothing is more priceless 
than your soul, and if she sold hers 
for power, status and a political 
footnote, then I hope she enjoys her 
ride down the River Styx. 

None of this will matter any- 
way in about two months. Well 
have forgotten all this anyway. All 
it will lake is another superstar to 
die or another war or a new Spice 
Girl Do ihe Main America. We 
have (he attention span of a lab rat 
hooked on nicotine and crack. All it 
lakes is one more dead princess and 
we won't even know who won ihe 
next election.

Q: Tom Cruise movies and 
Gladiator movies: What do they 
have in common? 



Bv No; Becklev 

Editor 



Since I returned 10 writing my 
column this week. I thought I 
would return lo my old semi- 
regular feature of "Editor's Picks" 
(a.k_a. space filler). And since I've 
been smoking crack every 15 min- 
utes since Saiurday, my usual gang 
of idiols and I decided lo tackle the 
most homosoiually explicit movies 
that claimed lo be heterosexual. But 
dammit, we're not gay! 

We had several "red light" items 
thai we looked ai. Some of them arc: 
Tom Cruise movies, boat movies. 
j Tony Cunis movies and prison 
movies. These are not in any order 
and remember, no wagering 



â¢ Top Gun 



All anyone has lo do is watch 
the volleyball scene and realize that 
sweaty men in [-shuts and jeans just 
scream "Scratch my eyes out. 
Mary." The ending scene when Val 
Kilmer says to Cruise, "You can be 
my wing man. anytime." And we all 
know what "wing man" is a 
metaphor for For added effect the 
locker room scene 

â¢ Spartacus 

This one is simple. Tony Curtis, 
a slave who sings songs, bathes Sir 
Laurence Olivier in a big Roman 
bath And if that ain't enough, as a 
rule, any movie with gladiators is a 
shoo-in for this list 

â¢ Reservoir Dogs 

The whole argument between 
who takes the name "Mr Pink" 
sums up this whole film. Everyone 
is arguing about who the snitch is. It 
could ha ye be en everyone arguing 
about who the straight in the mix is. 
And it ends so sweetly with Harvey 
Kietel holding Tun Roth in his arms 
as the police bust in and ruin their 
moment 

â¢ Green Berets 

Although we hate to include any 
. John Wayne film on this list, this 



HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. Can you get AIDS 
from a toilet seat? 

A. No, because even if 
the HIV virus could 
survive on a toilet 
seat, it would have to 
be able to enter the 
bloodstream in order 
for a person to 
become infected. 



about HIV/AIDS ans 
this column, you may submit 
lously to: 

HIV/AIDS information 



KelllerCSe, IPFW 



one screeched "Pick me, pick me " 

â¢ Moby Dick 

Here is another rule, any movie 
set on a boat full of men will nearly 
always earn a place on this list. 
Read (he book and try "&gt; figure out 
why Queequeg and Ishmacl are 
sleeping in the same hammock 
Hmmm can you say "Harpoon me"? 

â¢ Ben-Hur 

A group of shirtless slaves who 
arc being watched by ihe Roman 
leader and he chooses his favorite, 
Ben-Hur. "I like you big fella." is 
what the Roman basically says, or 
"come and play with me." 

â¢ Wall Street 

The locker room scene when 
Gordon Gecko dresses up in his 
Wall Street attire shows 
more than we needed to 
know. Michael 
Douglas plays the vet- 
eran queen while 
Charlie Sheen meek- 
ly becomes the inter- 
ested student who 
wants Gecko to show 
him the rope(s).

Dwarves 

C'mon. whal do you think the 
Dwarves did with each other before 

Snow showed up 

â¢ Cool Hand Luke 

This flick falls under another 
category of prison films with sweaty 
men. Paul Newman's unhealthy fix- 
ation with his mother is anoihcr red 
light in ibis classic siory of a guy 
struggling to be straight when 
everyone around him is trying to 
ium him. "What we have here is a 
failure to communicate." Sure. 

So there we go. There are many 
films that could have made the list, 
but for some straight reason or 
another they didn'i have the right 
swish. 

They are: Hang'em High, Tango 
and Cash, Conan the Barbarian and 
George of the Jungle.
