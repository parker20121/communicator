University rescinds banner prohibition 



Bv Gail Ruble Crawford 
News Editor 



Dasl Friday, the university 
rescinded the campus 
SOAR and ASTRO banner 
prohibition after a univer- 
sity review found that there 
was "a perception by some thai the 
policy was directed at a particular 
student organization," according to 
a campus memo outlining the new 
changes 

The Indiana Civil Liberties 
Union (ICLU) has been closely 
monitoring the recent prohibition at 
the request of United Sexualilies. 

In a letter addressed to 
Chancellor Michael Wanell. dated 
Jan. 14, Sean Lemicux. director of 
the Project for Equal Rights for the 
ICLU. declared IPFW's recent ban- 
ner prohibition '•unconstitutional."

current and

tion policies as

Fourteenth Amendment rights. 

The letter staled thai, "Although 
Firsi Amendment nghis are not 
absolute and may be subject io time, 
place and manner regulation, such 
restrictions must be narrowly tai- 
lored to serve legitimate govern- 
mental intercsLs and must be applied 
without regard to the content of the 



message 

"The expressive activity here 
docs not materially disrupt class 
work, does noi involve substantial 
disorder and docs not invade the 
rights of others. The regulation is 
not a reasonable time, place or man- 
ner restriction imposed in further- 
ance of the University's educational 
mission." 

According to Frank Borelli. vice- 
chancellor of student affairs, the 
decision to rescind the policy did not 
occur as a result of the ICLU inves- 
tigation or [be impending litigation 
posed by United Scxualities. 

"That's the opinion of that orga- 
nization, obviously," said Borelli. 

"The review of what was 
changed in policy was found to be 
constitutionally permissible. But 
because it seemed pointed at one 
student group, a review was con- 
ducted. We will be reverting back io 
the current posting policy as staled 




in the student handbook." 

Even though the university has 
rescinded the policy, the group at the 
center of the controversy. United 
Sexualilies, has decided to press 
campus charges against the universi- 
ty 

The group is asking that the 
Campus Board of Appeals hear the 
case and determine if a violation of 
their student rights has taken place. 
If the board determines thai a 
violation has taken place, Uniicd 
Scxualities would like the adminis- 
tration io adopt measures that ensure 
that similar violations of student 
rights do not occur in the future. 
according to Jeff Sterling, president 
of United Sexualilies. 

"This is not a gay rights 
issue. "said Sterling. "If Ihe 
University so carelessly breaks its 
own rules, what's to stop them from 
doing it again?" said Sterling. 

The alleged violation of nghts in 
question stems from the banner pro- 
hibition. The prohibition was added 
to the current campus posting policy 
in June. 

The change allowed only ihe 
Student Activities Department to 
hang banners during SOAR and 
ASTRO student orientation periods. 
Prior io the policy change, cam- 
pus organizations were guaranteed 
up to iwo reserved weeks each 
semester during which to hang their 
banner. Longer periods of display 
were available on the approval of 
Kim Jacobs, director of Student 
Activities. 

Alter the change in policy, the 
banner slots reserved by Uniied 
Scxualities for (he June. July and 
August student orientations were 
revoked. 

"The change was made to reflect 
the availability of spaces to post 
banners. There are a limited number 
of spaces on campus to post, but 
there are more (student groups) than 



Cars blur as they race through the Round-a-bout. 



there are spaces." said Borelli, in a 
phone interview. 

However, allegations have sur- 
faced about the reason for the poli- 
cy change 

According to Sterling, the uni- 
versity allegedly staled, in a 
Seplember meeting between 
Sterling, Borelli and IPSGA presi- 
dent Kevin Orthman, that the reason 
for the policy change was in 
response to an atmosphere created 
by Uniied Scxualities' advertising 
that makes current and potential stu- 
dents uncomfortable. 

Further, the university did not 
want lo endorse the gay lifestyle and 
felt that il needed to remove the 
"offensive" advertising, Sterling 
said. 

One such "offensive" advertise- 
ment in question was posted in early 
summer by United Scxualities. The 
posier depicted two shirtless males 
kissing 

Several complaints were regis- 
tered with the university concerning 
these posters. 

A meeting between Jacobs and 
Sterling, resolved that ihese posters 
were not pornographic in nature and 
United Sexualilies had violated no 
posting rules 

However, due to the volume of 
complaints regarding the posier. an 
agreement was reached between 
Jacobs and Sterling that posters such 
as the one in question would not be 
hung again. 

On Oct 27, a meeting between 
Donna Bialik. intenm dean of stu- 
dents, and Sterling resulted in a rcc- 
ommendation that United 
Scxualities pursue a violation of 
point one of the definition of harass- 
ment, as defined in the Student 
Handbook, against the university 
and Borelli, acting as an agent of the 
university. 

Sterling made the decision to 
pursue the complaint, "based on part 



one of the student code, which 
includes the nondiscrimination poli- 
cy protections for alternative 
lifestyles and guarantees First and 
Fourteenth Amendment protec- 
tions" 

On Nov. 4, an informal hearing 
occurred to discuss and resolve the 
issue in order to avoid possible liti- 
gation. 

United Sexualilies maintained 
thai the formation of the new policy 
was "a violation of their rights, as 
expressed in ihe 1PFW Code of 
Student Rights, Responsibilities, 
and Conduct and outlined in the 
Student Handbook ." Sterling said. 

He said the university had not 
recognized ihe "...freedom for the 
open expression of ideas and opin- 
ions within limits that protect the 
rights of others, and respeci for the 
views and dignity of other persons." 
According to Sterling, United 
Scxualities requested three things at 
the meeting: 

I Public apology issued to United 
Sexualilies, 

2. Reversal of Ihe new banner pro- 
hibition, 

3 Mandatory diversity training for 
all university employees. 

According to Sterling, Borelli 
stated at the lime that the universi- 
ty's position concerning the banner 
prohibition policy would remain in 
effect. 

He also staled that Uniicd 
Sexualilies advertising docs not cre- 
ate a comfoning, supportive envi- 
ronment for freshmen 

No agreement was reached at 
the meeting United Sexualilies then 
expressed its intention to file formal 
charges against the university 

"United Sexualilies Filed wilh 
Campus Appeals for a violation of 
the student code The Campus 
Appeals Board makes a recommen- 
dation lo the chancellor, who has the 
final say," said Sterling.

Legislative Issues results 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



This year's Legislative Issues 
Luncheon was held on Jan. 20, in 
Walb Union. Room 224. 

'The luncheon was organized in 
order lo educate people about Slate 
House Day." says Jennifer Bosk. 
Alumni Office Director. The lun- 
cheon was sponsored by the Alumni 
Office. 

Stale House Day involves lobby- 
ists from various Indiana campuses, 
vying to get more funding for the 
campus that they represent 

The Legislative Issues Luncheon 
is "a good way for all IPFW lobbyists 
io be (homogeneous) in what they 
address as IPFW's needs," said Bosk. 

The Legislative Issues Luncheon 
and subsequent State House Day 
should not be viewed as activities 
thai are dominated by administrators. 

If students opt nol lo get 
involved, however, the possibility 
exists. Thai is an option dial Bosk 
hopes students do nol choose. 

"We are trying to get more slu- 
dents involved," said Bosk, "because 
the legislators want io hear from stu- 
dents They feel administrators are 
just doing iheir jobs, but when a stu- 
dent says something, (about the uni- 
versity's needs) it is seen as a more 
irue re flection. " 

The State House Day trip lo 



Indianapolis is free for students. 
which Bosk hopes is an incentive for 
attending 

The students also get a chance to 
meel with legislators face-lo-facc to 
discuss Ihe financial needs of IPFW. 

The effort to get more students 
involved has been moderately suc- 
cessful. Last year, only three students 
made the trip to Indianapolis. Thirty 
people are slated lo go this year. 

The increase of 27 people may 
seem more than moderate to some, 
but when compared wilh other 
regional branches of Indiana 
University that bring busloads of lob- 
byists, having only 30 seems lo put 
ihe campus ai a disadvantage. 

"We're starting small," said 
Bosk. 

The speakers at the Legislative 
Issues Luncheon were: Wall 
Branson, vice chancellor of Financial 
Affairs; Terry Slrueh; assistanl vice 
president for Stale Relations al 
Purdue Universiiy; Sue Talbot direc- 
tor of Hoosicrs for Higher Education, 
Indiana University. Bloomington; 
and Chris Ternei, director of 
Government Affairs at the Fori 
Wayne Chamber 

According to Wall Branson, the 
luncheon "was a success." 

The first issue discussed al (he 
luncheon was doubling the amount of 
the technology fund, which is cur- 
rently non-recurring and is set at 
S450.000. 

The goal is turn it into a recurring 
fund (thai is. an amount thai the uni- 



versity will automatically receive 
yearly) and to double il to $900,000. 

The second issue presented was 
Purdue Universily's (West Lafayette) 
proposal for an agriculture extension 
program, which will house two lo 
three professors and would establish 
an agricultural center on campus. 

The lasl issue discussed was a 
plan io establish a technical outreach 
program in which IPFW staff would 
help businesses with start up and 
operational concerns and provide 
consultations on business and techni- 
cal mailers. 

Another issue raised ai the lun- 
cheon was "cquily funding " 
According lo Branson "compare 
IPFW to other regional campuses, 
we're near the bottom." 

Branson went on to say that if 
IPFW's direct-operating appropria- 
tions (basic funds allotted for stu- 
dents attending) were given a markei- 
adjusuneni io $3 million, the campus 
would be considered average in terms 
of funding. 

If ihe universily's funding was 
increased to 56 million, ihe campus 
would be fall into the above-average 
category, as docs IUPUL 

Jennifer Bosk summarized: 
"(The point) was educating people as 
io the goals, and as a result of educa- 
tion, people saw the duly they had to 
attend the special day in Indy "

Cafe, bookstore need better hours 



Any student knows thai 
oui "workday" isn't nine to 
five, and our "workweek" 
doesn't completely end come 
Friday evening. 

Our job, being student*, is 
24 hours a day without week- 
ends off. Unfortunately a 
couple of businesses here on 
campus seem to have forgot- 
ten this. 

Has anyone else noticed 
the quirky hours of the cafete- 
ria 7 Or the lack of hours the 
bookstore holds on die week- 
ends? Our question is this. 
"How can they serve the stu- 
dents when they aren't open?" 

Our first concern is the 
bookstore. We believe that 
being open only from 10 a.m. 
to 1 p.m. on Saturdays is com- 
pletely unsatisfactory. 

We have been on campus 
during the weekends before 
and were in need of computer 
discs. We went to the campus 
bookstore to purchase some, 
but to no avail, they were 
closed. This was at 3 p.m. in 
the afternoon. 

In their defense, they say 
there aren't enough students 
on campus and the minimal 
amount of traffic is the reason 
for their absence of hours. 

We feel that regardless of 
how many students there are 
on campus on the weekends, 



we are entitled to 
bookstore. 

Have you ever 
been in a comput- 
er lab and realized 
that you've for- 
gotten your disc? 
You've just fin- 
ished your term 
paper and you 
find someone to 
guard the comput- 
er that holds your 
grade. You sprint 
to the bookstore 
only to find it 
closed and it's 
only 2:30 p.m. on 
a Saturday. Now 
what do you do? 

The fact is. 
you should never 
be placed in that 
situation. 

Your campus 
bookstore should 
be open on the 
weekends, includ- 
ing Sundays. 

Maybe the 
bookstore thinks 
once the weekend 
hits we're all out 
partying, because 
according to their 
hours we don't do 
much on the 
weekends. We beg 



i open to differ. 

College is a job that nevi

pm. and by the time 
we get to the cafete- 
ria you've got all the 
hot food cleaned up 
and put in the back. 
Not to mention the 
salad bar has disap- 
peared by then too. 

We believe that 
there should be hot food 
available until 3 p.m. That it 
is die busiest tune on campus. 
From about 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m. is when most classes are 
\cheduled Therefore, most of 
us are in class and can't get to 
the cafeteria until after 2 p.m 

We don't think the cafete- 
ria is serving the best interests 
of the student body. If so. they 
would coordinate their hours 
to those of the students 

Why not be open for 
lunch 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Then 
close down for two hours. 
Prepare things for the next 
day and re-open at 5 p.m. to 
serve a "hot" dinner for night 
students until 7 pm.~ 



To the Editor: 

A long tune ago, I heard a story 
about two frogs One, upon being 
placed into a pot of boiling water, 

ediately reacted to her sudden 

imfon by jumping out. The 
other frog was placed into a pot of 

n water. As the temperature 

increased, he failed to realize 
that the water was gradually com- 
ing to a boil. He stayed until it was 
too late to jump 

More recently, a story in the 
loumal-Gazette stated that political 
activity among today's college stu- 
dent's was at an all lime low One 

m given for this attitude was 
that many young people feel that 
there are no "burning issues" com- 
pelling them to take action. How. 
you might ask, could these two sto- 
ries be related? Please read on. 

Most people, like frogs, react to 
extreme discomfort while failing to 
perceive the subtle changes 
Unfortunately, many political 
.ues are "slow-burning" rather 
than "boiling point." This results in 
a situation where people are unwill- 
ing to take action, while the prob- 
lems in our society slowly come to 
a boil I believe that people who 
are not involved in the political 
process can be divided into four 
groups; stupid, ignorant, think they 
can't make a difference and just 
don't give a damn I have a 
response for each of these posi- 
tions. 

For those who are stupid, let 
me educate you. A decline happens 
gradually, but the fall comes quick- 
ly Try chopping down a tree. With 
each cut, it's strength is weakened, 
it begins lo waver, but still stands. _. ... 
Finally, you hear it crack, then Phillip Marx 
there's nothing you can do but run ,__.,., -^ 
because it's going to fall-fast and IPFW STUDENT 
hard Don't be stupid, don't wait 



until the issues are beyond your 
control. 

Some of you know there are 
problems that need attention, but 
you're not sure what the solutions 
are. or bow to implement them. 
You fall into the ignorant category, 
and I suggest this: Educate your- 
self Learn the issues and learn the 
political processes so that you can 
affect change. 

"But one person can't make a 
difference." Let's be realistic. You 
cant expect everyone to just bow 
down to your selfish desires. But 
you can find issues upon which 
your views arc shared by others 
Join an organization and combine 
your efforts with others By orga- 
nizing you multiply (he results of 
your efforts and in this way you 
make a difference. 

For those who just don't give a 
damn: I'm sorry to have disturbed 
you Please go back to sleep, or 
hang out at Pierre's, or whatever it 
is you do with your spare time And 
don't worry, within 50 years or so 
you'll probably be dead Surely 
your unaitenliveness to our prob- 
lems can't make things much worse 
in that short period of lime. But 
please, in the mean time, don't be 
one of those people who constantly 
complains about or interferes with 
those who arc at least trying to 
solve the problems 

The fact of the matter is 
there are burning issues today But 



like the frog, we don't perceive the 
slowly changing situation 
maybe we're just too comfortable 
in our little pots, unwillin;

Besides, the water's not boiling yet, 
it's just hot. very hot.

On my mind: sdanna Dove, 



There is an epidemic sweeping 
through the classrooms across IPFW. 
Whai is it you ask, considering no 
one has informed you of anything 
out of the ordinary going on. That is 
why I am here, to explain to you 
what I call: Classroom Corruption. 

It is a cons [ant growing problem 
that affects every student here in 

i way or another, Maybe it is 
you who is causing the corruption or 
maybe you are one of its countless 
victims. 

I. myself, am a victim of this 
plague Jusl the other day I was dili- 
gently taking notes in class, when 
&gt; students nexl to me decided to 
make plans for the upcoming week- 
end. They were talking for at leasi 
len minutes straight. I was so 
annoyed by the situation that the pro- 
fessor's voice was totally drowned 
out. and I completely missed the 
entire summary of his lecture 1 was 

a happy person Bui, there was 
really not loo much I could do about 

After this episode I watched over 
my class for the next couple of times 
and decided 1 would find the ulti- 
mate power seat I decided to posi- 
tion myself in a seal where I was sure 
the surrounding students would not 
talk. I was wrong The two students, 
Who 1 assumed were as eager to 



learn as I, talked almost the entire 50 
minutes of the class. Once again I 
was the victim of Classroom 
Corruption 

1 tried very hard to understand 
the need for my fellow students lo 
talk dunng class, but I really could 
not. I could not comprehend why 
they didn't write down whai they 
bad to say or simply wail I then 
asked myself whose faull is it really? 
I came down lo the conclusion of 
three possibilities: myself, my peers 
or my professors. 

When I considered myself as a 
possibility for the blame of the prob- 
lem I was only trying lo be fair. Who 
knows, maybe I am the one with die 
problem 

We are all here to get a better 
education, so thai we can get better 
jobs, so why is it necessary to talk 
during class Should I be forced to sit 
in a place that I am not comfortable, 
just because others have a problem 
with talking'' I honcsdy do noi feel 
that placing the blame on myself is a 
very rational answer, but I was only 
trying to be fair. 

The next possibility were my 
peers. Without having assigned seats 
in college, many students cannot 
handle the adult atmosphere, where 
they are permitted to sil by their 
friends. Who would think that col- 



lege students would find the concept 
of shutting up so hard to grasp? 

Bui, can we really place the 
blame on the students or do the pro- 
fessors have a major problem with 
the lack of control? 

When most students talk, the 
professor is aware of it so why don'l 
they say anything? You know they 
have lo get imtated by students who 
interrupt their lectures and don't pay 
attention. They also have to realize 
the interference that ii provides for 
the rest of ihe students in the class. 

With the different people lo 
blame. I came down to one issue that 
has to be the answer respect. The 
students do not have respect for the 
other studenLs or the professors for 
ihat matter. There is an overall lack 
of respeel that the students are giving 
off and it's popping up more and 
more around campus. 

I have talked to some fellow stu- 
dents and they think just as I do. 
although they are guilty of talking 
during class. 

1 only want people to realize 
that even if they think no one can 
hear them whispering, we can. I 
know I am not the only one that 
wants to succeed in college, so if you 
are contributing lo Classroom 
Corruption in a negative manner, 
shut your mouth and pass a note!

Role models, responsibility and influence 



Your Turn: Heide Helnlck.e 



According 10 the Random House 
Websier's College dictionary, a role 
mode) is a "person whose behavior 
in a particular social selling is imi- 
taicd by others, especially by 
younger persons" 

As very young children, we 
grow up imitating cartoon super 
heroes like Superman. Wonder 
Woman, or the Power Rangers. 

As we get older, our role models 
become singers, aclors and athletes 
like Barbara Streisand. Ellen 
Degeneres and Michael Jordon 
Role models even take the form of 
teachers, clergy, relatives and neigh- 
bors. 

Young children and teenagers 
learn good things like the value of 
honest work and caring enough to 
spend tunc with someone. Many 
young people have made something 
out of their lives because someone 



I have bad a few role models in 
my life. I admired them for many 
reasons and learned valuable tilings 
from them 

First, I learned at a young age 
that I would have to push myself 
very bard to get ahead in this world, 
not just because I'm a female, but 
because I also nave a disability I 
guess I learned that from my parents 
and it has served me well in certain 
situations. 

I met a gentleman in the theater 
several years ago named Hal 
Gunderson He was the director of 
Jesters, a group of actors with vari- 
ous types of disabilities. He gave 
each of us an incredible opportunity 
to show others that we had value. He 
believed in each of us and that is a 
most precious gift, I think, anyone 
has ever given to me and I can give 
to another 



I had a professor in college. Dr. 
Kcllcy. who had a good impact on 
my life too. She cared enough to lis- 
ten when I needed it She also 
encouraged me to reach my poten- 
tial even when 1 thought about giv- 
ing up She wouldn't accept my 
excuses. 

I also had a couple of singers as 
role models They were Dolly 
Panon and Barbara Streisand. Both 
of these women grew up poor, but 
became famous in spite of it. They 
didn't let their spirit be broken by 
people making fun of their large 
chest or big nose These women also 
have donated money to worthwhile 
causes. 

Barbara Streisand, in particular, 
is a role model because she is not 
only talented and. in my opinion, 
pretty, she is also very smart and has 
definite views about various things. 
For a woman, I think, that is still not 



Fires ianite thouqhts throuqh the ashes 



Letting Go. Jeremy Ecen6arger 



"The day of the lord will 
come like a thief The heavens will 
disappear with a roar, the elements 
will be destroyed by fire, and the 
earth and everything in it will he 
laid bare." 2 Peter 3:10 

The smoke has entered my 
lungs, crept its way to my brain and 
has altered my view of the world. It 
has come from the left, the nght and 
directly in front of me. The blaze 
has beckoned me. The red, blanng 
Dames have burned me. Yet, what 
docs it all mean? 

Is it just me or have there been 
a rare flash of fires lately' First, 
they took my friend's house when 
his Christmas tree suddenly caught 
fire and turned the walls to ashes. 
Next, my poor friend at Three 
Rivers Apartments left her clothes 
drying on the heater and sent her 
studio in a blaze Finally, beyond all 
horror, they look my restaurant. 
Cheddars' menu is no longer exis- 
tent. Each fire has made its way 
closer to me, as if warning me lo 
beware and to take heed. 

Being a strong believer that 
everything happens for a reason, I 
cannot help hut think that these are 
signs of something still to come. 
So, since the fires began, I find 
myself looking over my apartment 
for things that may cause the next 
91 1 call. I scurry to the trash can to 
make sure the cigarette butts 1 bad 
thrown in there earlier were fully 
burnt out. Next, I fly up the stairs 10 
make sure my roommate remem- 
bered to blow out the candles she 
constantly lights. Finally, my jour- 
ney lakes me to every light in the 
house to make sure the light bulbs 
are not overheating. Paranoia is just 
running through my veins. 

However, the fumes of these 
fires have mostly affected my way 
of thinking My life sometimes 
feels like a Chicago interstate, 
where I'm going 75 miles-per-hour 
and cannot slow down because of 
the fear that someone might ram me 
from behind So. instead of pushing 
on the break, 1 push the cruise con- 
trol and glide in and out of traffic 



Many times, collisions alter my 
path; yet I never stop to see if 
everything is OK The highway is 

long, with no rest slops, and the 
traffic never seems to weaken 

These fires have set off a type 
ofexplosioninmy mind. They have 
eluded my every thought. The light 
which illuminates them has given 
me the ability to stop and think 
about my long journey and final 
destination. For once, 1 see the vic- 
tims of the accidents of my pasi and 
the ones who have somehow man- 
aged lo stay up to speed. 

It seems like a practical result. 
Disaster strikes and makes a person 
realize that hfe takes many swerv- 
ing turns. However, it's only when 
that person sits and thinks about 
those turns when their life begins to 
take a clear direction. 

Students, particularly at 1PFW, 
often get caught up in a bind when 
trying to manage a job, school and a 
social life. Sometimes things can 
become so overbearing that the stu- 
dent docs not know whether to 
maintain their responsibilities or 
their heart. So. eventually, there 
comes a time when that person has 
lo let things slip by them. Whether 
it is the one true love who cannot 
take the busy schedule. The class 
that requires too much lime to 
achieve an adequate grade The pro- 
motion that makes it necessary for a 
person to be in the office more but 
increases their salary. Something is 
always being passed by. 

The fires have made me realize 
that life is too short to worry about 
the things that have blown by me.

Sure. I once was editor of a great 
newspaper, but now I have the time 
to divide between work, my friends 
and projects long left unfinished. 
Although, 1 would not have traded 
that experience for anything. And 
maybe that person would have been 
the love of my life, but. if that's so, 
they will return I regret letting 
some things get away from me. yet 
somehow other developments have 
Liken their place. I guess that is the 
evolution of life. 

So, as I look at the remains the 
fires have left behind. I Hunk about 
the importance of every small thing 
that means something lo me. Within 
the ashes at my feet, I see the 
importance of life's lessons. In fact.

coincidental fires? Or a sign lo 
never take anything for granted?

Young people can learn many 
valuable things from role models. 
but they can also learn the perceived 
fun of smoking, drugs, sex without 
consequences and that it is okay to 
disrespect, bale and hurt others 

I believe ii is viial that all of us 
watch what we say and do all of the 
time because chances are there is a 
young child watching us. looking for

bility to be a role model It doesn't 
necessarily require money Your time 
is more valuable to a child.

Bv Nol Beckley 
Editor 

Monday night. Fort Wayne host- 
ed the number one wrestling pro- 
gram on television. They may nol be 
a big deal to some, but World 
Championship Wresiiing"s (WCW) 
Monday NITRO is also one of the 
highest rated shows on cable. 

Monday night's show sold more 
than S 100.000 in ticket sales the first 
day tickets went on sale. Wrestling 
has not been this popular since the 
hey-day of the Rock-n- 
Wrcstling connection in the 80s. 

But this resurgence of 
wrestling is different from 80s 
according to Bobby 'The Brain" 
Heenan, former wrestler and 
manager. 

Heenan said wrestling's 
popularity during the 80s was 
only based on one company that 
basically dominated the 
wrestling scene, especially north 
of the Mason/Dixon line Now 
there is competition for 
wrestling's viewers. 

"[WWF owner) Vincc 
[McMahon] had no competi- 
tion," Heenan said. 

NITRO faces the World 
Wrestling Federation's RAW 
every Monday night and for the 
last two years. NITRO has won 
the timeslol 

Heenan, who has been 
around wrestling since 1965, 
has watched wrestling and 
wrestlers evolve since the 60s to 
today's faster and better condi- 
tioned wrestlers. 

Along came cable and the 
landscape of wrestling changed. 
Heenan said wrestling was shot 
for TV on Saturday morning and 
you spent the rest of the week dri- 



ving around to different venues 

"In the early days you ale late 
and you ate shit," Heenan said 

Even though Heenan sounds as 
if he misses those early barnstorm- 
ing days of wrestling, he said being 
in wrestling today is great. 

'This is the most fun I've ever 
had in wrestling," Heenan said 

Much of wrestling revival 
comes from the president of WCW, 
Eric Bischoff. 

"Bischoff he's a genius . . He's 
like the Donald Trump of 



wrestling," Heenan said. 

The style of wresUing shown on 
TV has changed, Heenan said. Ted 
Turner, who also owns WCW (along 
with the rest of the world) wants to 
see "more family oriented entertain- 
ment." 

Heenan look some shots at 
WCW's main competitor, the WWF 
and its attempt bring a "reality cle- 
ment" into wresding. 

"There is no reason to be lewd. . . 
Desperate people will do desperate 



things," Heenan said. 

Heenan left the nng in 1991 
after an incident when he tried to 
interview Hulk Hogan. According to 
Heenan, Hogan grabbed him by the 
neck and aggravated a neck injury 
that happened in 1983 In 1983. 
Heenan thought he pinched a nerve 
in his neck, when in reality his neck 
was broken. 

Heenan had some disks from his 
spine removed to remedy the prob- 
lem.

Modems 
speed up 



Mac vs. Windows . . . 




By Ben Ruble 
Staff Whiter 

Do you get tired of all of the 

wailing of the Internet with your 
small 14.4 Kbps modem or 
maybe your 33.6 Kbps modem? 

Ii can be so slow. The worst 
part is if you download a large 
file. It can take several hours 
depending on the size of the file. 

The Internet is the frontline 
of technology. 

Why is it so slow? Well, 
somebody is finally going to do 
something about it. 

Intel Corp., Microsoft, 
Compaq Computer Corp. and 
many oilier major companies are 
planning on working with 
telecommunication companies to 
develop high speed Internet 
access. 

This high speed access is 
called Tl. Tl was developed in 
the 1980s and there have been 
many versions available for sev- 
eral years. 

But, this generally costs 
about S2.200 per month. Much 
of this is because of the exten- 
sive labor costs for everything 
that must be installed. 

The companies working on 
developing this are hoping to 
make it very practical and afford- 
able. 

They believe that it would 
cost Internet customers about 
S40/monlh. 

For S40/monih, customers 
would have Tl which can deliver 
1.5 million bytes (1 million 
bytes= 1 megabyte) per second 
which is approximately 30 times 
faster than today's fastest 
modems. 

What does it mean for us? 

We are finally going to be 
able to see the "Teal" Internet. 

Now. people have to limit the 
size of each webpage due to slow 
modems. 

With Tl, the websites can 
come alive with Java, Active X, 
Real Audio. Dynamic HTML, 
etc. 

When will Tl be available 1 

Ameriiech and GTE plan on 
offering Tl on a limited basis 
early this year. 

It appears within the next 
year we will see major changes 
in Internet access and the Internet 
itself.

Corner 




By Ben Ruble 
Staff Writer 

There arc many loyal Apple 
Macintosh users who believe that 
the Mac is best PC to use. But, then 
there are the vast majority of com- 
puter users who use computers with 
the Windows 95 operating system 
because they like it. a larger variety 
of software is available, or they use 
it just because of the dominance of 
Micro so fL 

Whaiever the case, almost 
every computer 
prefers one system 
the other. 

A rece 
Family PC 
magazine 
designee 
seven rounds 
of tests 

out which system 
comes out on top in 
a certain area. 

The one with the 
most points would be 
considered the ■ best sys- 
tem to use. This sounds 
like a simple enough of 
test, right? Below are the 
results of each round. I won' 
go into much detail on each 
round, but I will list their' 
results. 

Computers used for this test cost 
under $2000. 

Round 1: 

The Hardware Specs 

They used a Hewlett-Packard 

Pavilion to compare against a Power 
Macintosh 6500/225. Both have 
similar specs, but the Pavilion has a 
better modem, larger bard disk, 
wavetable support in ihe sound sys- 
tem and a faster CD-ROM. 
Edge: fdvillwn 



Round 2, 
Bundled Software 

Family PC believes the Mac has a 
better software bundle than the 
Pavilion. The Mac came with 31 
programs and the Pavilion came 
with 23. 
Edge: Macintosh 

Round 3: 
The Setup 

The setup on the Pavilion comes 
with very little reading for the new 
ser. The Mae is loaded with 
things to read. However, the 
rest of the setup is pretty easy 
on both machines. 
Edge: Push 




Well. Family PC 
agreed that is easier to 
use than ihe Windows 95 
based Pavilion. 1 have to dis- 
agree with this statement. I 
believe Windows 95 just looks 
complicated because it offers 
more features. If you ignore 
the special features, 
whatever. J 

Edge: Macintosh «i 



Round 6: 
Software Availability 

What system won? Obviously the 
Pavilion won this round. However, 
Family PC did point out that there is 
almost as much software available 
for the Macs as for the Windows 
machines, but retailers carry smaller 
varieties of Mac software. 
Edge: Pavillion 

Round 7; 
Maintenance 

Fixing software problems on the 
Mac is easier than fixing problems 
on Windows machines. But, if you 
need maintenance on your Mac. 
you're likely to spend more. They 
gave this round to the Mac. I would 
have called it a tie. Windows 
machines tend to be cheaper to fix 
and that is a major plus. 
Edge: Macintosh 

The Final Results 

It is a lie! 

It is very difficult to choose 
which system to buy. I would buy a 
Windows 95 machine any- 
,/"■ day Apple may be back to 
making a profit, but look 
company in the 
last few years. For 
an in-depth 
version of 
this analy- 
is, it is avail- 
able in the 
February Family 




Round 5: 
Speed 

The Pavilion used 
in this test had a 200- 
Mhz Intel MMX processor. 
The Mac had a 225-Mhz 
PowerPC processor. During the 
speed experiments, the Pavilion won 
every time.

Spouts Editor 



Afler several years in the cellar of die Great Lakes Valley 
Conference (GLVC), head coach Tony Vitiorio begins this season 
wiih a more optimistic look at where his learn will finish, and he 
isn't alone. 

In Hie preseason coaches poll ll'FW was picked to finish fifth 
in the North Division Even though this is only one place higher 
than last place it Mill shows some respect. The individual voles 
showed a greater mark of respect because the Dons not only did- 
n't get any last place votes but also the preseason favorite to win 
the division, Lewis University picked the Dons to place third. 

"We had a ihree-gamc series last season with Lewis 
thai was as hard fought as I have seen," Vitiorio said 
"Every game was decided by one run and we came 
ready to play." Obviously Lewis U was impressed. 

Some key players that the Dons will be looking to 
replace are Terry Johnson. Jim Knight and John 
Cummings. Johnson led me team in several offensive 
categories and is headed to Arizona this summer to try 
and play professional baseball in an independent 
league. Knight hit .323 and was second in doubles, but 
the loss of his leadership on and off the field will be the 
hardest to replace Cummings didn't have the greatest 
numbers but was very consistent and was rewarded for 
his good play by being drafted by the Tampa Bay 
Devi trays 

The players that Vitiorio will be looking for from 
last year lo lead the team are Danny Mathews (RHP), 
Jason JafTe (OF), Rico Martin (IF) and Ryan Wallace 
(IF). Mathews was last year's number one pitcher with 
a solid 90 mph fastball Jaffe had 10 homeruns and led 
the team in Runs Batted in. Martin had II homeruns 
but is nursing a serious knee injury from this fall and 
Vitiorio doesn't know whether he will be 100 percent at 
the start of the season. 

Wallace "is one of the most consistent players lhat I 
have ever coached and coaches are comfortable with 
consistency because you don't gel a surprise that is neg- 
ative," said Vitiorio. 

Last year's team was very explosive offensively. 
The big inning was the Don's bread and butler, but 
Vntorio doesn't feel comfortable in winning this way. 

"Big inning (earns are lough to coach because you 
don't know when the inning is going to come around. 
We showed ihis type of offense in the fall season bul I 
will try to get a more consistent type of offense this 
spring." Vitiorio said. 

Last year's team hit .320 and had 46 homeruns, but 
the pitching staff allowed 47 homeruns and was Ihe 
Dons nemesis last year. The combined youth and lack 
of experience sorely hurt Ihe learn down the stretch. 

To stabilize the pitching staff three junior college 
transfers were brought in to help: Curtis Wagers (RHP) 



and Keith Weaver (LHP) from Danville Community College and 
Michael Scroggs (LHP) from Lincoln Trail Community College. 
Other players lhat are going lo be counted on to make significant 
contributions are Bill Seagerman (IF) from Olympic Junior 
College, Brad Smock (C/OF) from Carroll High School and Evan 
Glassley (IF) from Concordia High School 

Instead of resting on last year's success the Dons will have 
their work cut out for them with five opponents in the preseason 
Top 30. The Dons make a inp to North Alabama and these first 
games will be very important on how ihe season goes. 

"1PFW baseball isn't a fluke anymore," said Vmorio. "You 
had better strap your shoes on and gel afler it because I know my 
team has "
