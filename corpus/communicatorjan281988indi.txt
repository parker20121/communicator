Senate tables search for adviser 



BY DAVID N, BRNSON 
News Editor 

The student senate tabled a resolu- 
tion calling for a search and screen 
committee to find an adviser. 

The bill, introduced by Robert 
Bishop, student senator, would es- 
tablish a search and screen committee 
consisting of four student senators 
appointed by FYesident Kurt Gregory 
and would be headed by Vice 
President Phil Downs, 

"/ think I've really taken a 
strong pro-student stand. I 
have supported Students ' 
Government on the colors 
issue and the booksale. " 

Marion Adair 



Although the student senate is cur- 
rently advised by Marian Adair, di- 
rector of career services, Bishop said 
he saw no resolutions making Adair 
adviser, although he. invited Adair to 
apply tor the post durmg floor debate. 
In an interview after the meeting 
Bishop said Adair had not been ex- 
tremely helpful to the senate, "Her 
level of support and guidance has been 
negligible as far as passing bills and 
resolutions,'* Bishop said 



Adair defends her performance. In 
an interview Friday, Adair said, "I 
think I've really taken a strong pro- 
student stand. I have supported Stu- 
denls' Government on the colors issue 
and the booksale." 

Both Gregory and Downs voiced 
confidence in Adair. After the meet- 
ing. Downs, who would chair Uie 
search and screen commlltee, said he 
would vote for Adair without even 
considering other candidates. Gregory 
also said he was satisfied with Adair's 
performance, "She stepped into the 
job under very controversial circum- 
stances and under those circum- 
stances she's done a very good job," 
Gregory said. 

Bishop also introduced a bill to 
grant a one-time gift of (500 for the 
formation of a pep band The bill 
passed unanimously. Karen Chapman 
from the alumni office attended the 
meeting to answer questions about llie 
pep banA. Chapman said the alumni 
office was donating $1000 as was the 
athletic department and Students' 
Government money would be used for 
general expenses such as buying 
music. 

"What we are really working toward 
is to get a really slick group together 
by the time of the NCAA volleyball 
playoffs. National television exposure 
would be really good." Chapman said. 



A scries of personnel changes also 
occurred, Tina Long and Sandra 
Hadtey resigned as student senators. 
The student senate accepted the peti- 
tion of Rhonda Ransophcr, a 
sophomore political science major. 



Mary Brant has resigned her posi- 
tion as adviser to the Student Ac- 
tivities Board lo lake a new position in 
Career Services. Indra Matulionis. 
SAB chairperson, said. "We are sorry 
to see a valuable adviser leave us." 



Coufoudakis interviewed 
for vice chancellor post 



BV CHRIS HELMS 
Staff Writer 

The search for a new vice chancel- 
lor of academic affairs continued last 
Thursday with the interviewing of 
candidate Van Coufoudakis on his 
qualifications and goals, 

Coufoudakis, who is now assistant 
vice chancellor for academic affairs, 
said his 20 years of experience in the 
lU system provided him with a unique 
perspective on the problems and needs 
of the university, Coufoudakis also 
said he had been the chairman for the 
lU Center for Global Studies for six 
years and had been assistant dean of 
the faculty, for one year 

Coufoudakis said his objectives in- 
clude increasing minority membership 
on both the staff and the student body, 
expanding the scope of undergraduate 
education, and beginning an assess- 
ment of undergraduate training, 

"Assessment would give us the op- 
portunity to see which areas we need 
to improve as well as giving an over- 
all picture of the type of students 
we're graduating." Coufoudakis said, 

Psi Iota Xi 
offers prize 



Aspiring writers may try the Psi 
lota Xi writing contest. The contest 
winner will earn (200 provided by the 
organization, 

Steve Hollander, an assisUnt pro- 
fessor of English who is coordinating 
the contest, explained that entrants 
must be undergraduates at IPFW and 
have a 3,0 grade point average in both 
college English work and a 3.0 grade 
point average overall, Hollander 
pointed out that entrants may be 
enrolled for either semester. 

Those entering the contest may 
submit no more than two short stories 
between 750 and 2500 words in length. 
The stories must be unpublished, 
typewritten, and double-spaced Au- 
thors should not place their names on 
Ihe manuscript; instead each author 
should include a blank, sealed enve- 
lope containing the title of the manu- 
script as welt as the author's name, 
address and telephone number. 

Entries should be dropped off in the 
department of English and linguistics, 
room US of the Classroom Medical 
Building before the Monday, March 
28. deadline. The winner will be 
announced by Tuesday, April 26. 



Coufoudakis also said under- 
graduate assessment Is becoming a 
national trend and, more importantly, 
the slate will want to know how ef- 
ficiently its grant dollars are spent. 
"When that day comes." Coufoudakis 
said, '"we will be able to say not only 
are we graduating enlightened stu- 
dents, but we are also doing it in a 
very cost-efficient manner.

dent plaza located between Neff Hall 
and the Classroom-Medical Building. 

According to Matthew Kublk, asso- 
ciate professor of civil and archi- 
tectural engineering, the studehts 
have nowhere to gather on campus. A 
student plaza would solve that 
problem. 



Enrollment on the rise 
from fall 1987 figures 



student enrollment at IPFW has 
risen from last year. The enroll- 
ment tor the spring of 1988 is 10.086 
students, compared with 9,626 
students during the spring of 1987. 

"We have sufficient work- 
study dollars available for 
students even with in- 
creased enrollment. The 
question is whether stu- 
dents really want to work 
on campus. " 

Richard 8«IIowb 



"We're up by about 460 stu- 
dents," said Jack Dahl, IPFW 
Registrar, "that is, about 4.8 per- 
cent." Dahl said the enrollment for 
the fall semester of 1987 was 10,851 
students, but added that the figures 
were not really comparable. 

Transfer students are also in- 
cluded in the statistics. "We ad- 
mitted jusi over 500 students who 
were transferring to Fort Wayne 
from another university." Dahl 



said of this semester ■That is not 
significantly different from last 
year." 

The enrollment figures are still 
well within the bounds of what 
IPFW can handle. "There's really 
none," said Dahl of Ihe potential 
limit of IPFW's enrollment, "be- 
cause of the large number of part- 
time students. When you have that 
kind of enrollment, there's really 
no way to set a max- 
imum enrollment," 

ftelated to enrollment is Ihe 
availability of financial aid and 
work-sludy programs, Richard M. 
Bellows, director of Financial Aid, 
said there are approximately 2,500 
students receiving financial aid, as 
well as another 200 on work study. 

Even if enrollment increases, 
though, there should be no problem 
with student funding. Besides fi- 
nancial aid, Bellows said, "We 
have sutflcleni work-study dollars 
available for students even with 
increased enrollment The question 
is whether students really want to 
work on campus." 

Bellows added that students in- 
terested in financial aid and work 
study should first file a fuiancia! 
aid form, then check with the 
financial aid office. 



The pla^ would include sculptures 
by Faculty and students, and possibly 
a life-size mastodon model. 

Benches would also be scattered 
throughout the Plaza and protected 
from the wind by sculptured stone 
windbreaks. Reflecting pools might be 
added to the plaza to draw attention 
back to the campus local point, the 

The student plaza will replace Ihe 
parking lots between Neff Hall and 
(; lass room -Medical Building, 

Another proposed change is an a- 
Irium connecting Helmke Library and 




Walb Memorial Union. Walls and a 
glass roof would form an enclosed 
area which could be used in all 
weather for a much better use of that 
space, Kubik said. 

Another addition to the campus is a 
research tower. The tower will be 
placed along the river and will be 
prominent enough to view from 
downtown Fort Wayne, 

Kubik said the tower will tie IPFW 
in with the community by being im- 
mediately identifiable with the 
campus.

Money talks 

What are we paying for? 



Modernizing IPFW is a long, 
overdue process Ihat is just 
beginning 

Plans have been drafted and re- 
vised to renovate the exterior of the 
campus Atriums have lieen added, 
plazas planned and structures 
sketched. 

Obviously, one major obstacle to 
all this reaching fruition remains: 
money . 

Unfortunately, no one seems to 
want to discuss where the money 
for these planned ventures is going 
to come from. There has been some 
talk about "donations" and "pri- 
vate funding" bul nothing definite 
and nothing the administration is 
willing to discuss. 

This project is not a nickel and 
dime operation. Millions of dollars 
will be needed to build roads, tow- 
ers, plazas and parking lots to re- 
place the lots IPFW is losing. 

Where will this money come 
from? 

Unforlunalely, the money could 
come from students in the form of 
higher tuition. 

Do students really wani to pay to 
"modernize" the exterior of IPFW? 



Students may feel that adding 
classes or developing a core cur- 
riculum might aid them more in 
Iheir academic progress at IPFW 
than say— a research tower 

Unfortunately, the students may 
not have much voice in these deci- 
sions. If the administration won't 
talk about money with students, it 
is doubtful if the administration 
will confer with students before 
raising tuition- 

Of course it is entirely possible 
the administration can raise sever- 
al million dollars without a tuition 
hike After all. nearly nine million 
dollars was raised to build the 
proposed Fine Arts Building. 

Money aside, there is always the 
parking issue. However in the pro- 
posals are there plans for a parking 
garage A parking garage is more 
than twice as expensive as flat-land 
parking. However, since the ren- 
ovation already has run into mil- 
lions of dollars, what's a paltry few 
thousand more? 

The students would appreciate 
convenient parking more than any 
of the other "improvements." 



Management talks let Bearing 
Mend fences, build bridges 



Next Tuesday. Purdue University 
President Steven Beering and In- 
diana University President Tom 
Ehrlich will visit Fort Wayne 
From 2 to 2:45 p.m. the two presi- 
dents will hold an open meeting in 
room G21 in Walb Memorial Union 
and hear from student groups 

The purpose of the two presi- 
dents' visit will be to discuss the 
management agreement by which 
Indiana and Purdue Universities 
run IPFW, There could be no better 
time for this- 

For Beering, now is the time to 
mend fences. Beering's decision 
requiring IPFW to use only lU or 
Purdue colors for official use has 
given the color issue a new dimen- 
sion. No more is it simply a ques- 
tion of whether Arnie Ball's vol- 
leyball team will wear red and gold 
or blue and white to the Division II 
championships. Now the question is 
how much power IPFW has in 
making the decisions that affect it 
Beering's actions suggest IPFW's 
influence should be nil. 

The IPFW faculty senate under- 
stands this point well Last week, 
the body voted to declare blue and 
white the official colors of IPFW 
Although the vote cannot reverse 
Beering's decision, it was certainly 
a slap at what the senate saw as 
Beering's heavy-handedness. 

More disturbing than Beering 



was an editorial supporting the 

Purdue president's actions on the 

color issue printed in the Exponent, 

the Purdue student paper. The ffjM rf r'rkwn wnt&gt;nf^ 

Exponent took the position that -«»"**'*' ^unirriVill9 

since Purdue "doles out" money to 

IPFW, Purdue should have a say in 

how that money is spent. If IPFW 




doesn't like it, then the Fort Wayne 
campus should consider becoming 
an independent university. The 
editorial even concluded, "Don't 
bite the hand that feeds you," 

What is irksome is that some of 
the data being gathered suggest 
that IPFW is actually underfundei' 
in comparison to other regiona 
campuses- So much for the hanc 
that feeds us. 

It is important not to link the 
Exponent's views too closely with 
Beering's. The Exponent no more 
speaks for Beering than The 
Communicator speaks for Chancel- 
lor Wallace. But if the Exponent 
represents any fraction of West 
Lafayette's view of Fort Wayne, 
then Beering's visit becomes even 
more important. Neither president 
should be allowed to leave Walb 
agreeing with the Exponent's edi- 
torial writers. 

Instead, both presidents should 
leave Fort Wayne with a keener 
appreciation of IPFW's needs and 
aspirations. 



Textbook answers do not tell whole story 



Every once in a while a 
student will come up to me 
and say, "Just whal exactly 
do you people in Students' 
Government do?" After 
fumbling through some 
textbook answer about how 
we lobby for student rights 
and mleresLs. they will say. 
"well, what have you done 
for me?" That's an easy 
one 

Commentary 

The Student Activity 
Board. SAB. chaired by 
Indra Matulionis, has had 
an excellent year. They 
have brought us a concert 
by Henry Lee Summer, 
lectures (most notably, the 
lecture by former U.S. 
Senator Birch Bayh), and 
sponsored Breakfast with 
Santa in December. Aside 
from these big projects, 
they have their week to 
week platining to do as well, 
for example, the " 
parties. 



Tlie Senate, while being 
called everything from 
"dedicated" to "neo-nazis," 
has done more in the last 
semester than in the pre- 
vious two years. They have 
passed resolutions calling 
for AB parking in the lot 
between Neff Hall and the 
Classroom-Medical Build- 
ing, and been vocal on the 
color issue. Perhaps the 
largest project of "the 
semester was undertaken - 
by Barb Kucharski and 
Forbes Mcintosh. They 
sponsored bills and resolu- 
tions calling for a used 
booksale. While drawing up 
resolutions is pretty easy, 
they did all the work setting 
it up, running it, and paying 
the employees. All in all, 
the twoksale delivered over 
$1,000 of Follett's profit 
back to the students. Con- 



d thanks. Barb and 



All in all, ihe booksale 
delivered over $1000 of 
Foiled 's prolii back lo 
the students 



So what will your Stu- 
-dents' Government be doing 
Jor you this_s_em ester? Al- 
ready some' senators are 
planning an improved 
booksale for the end of this 
year. Don't give up on the 
faculty /course evaluations, 
we haven't. SAB is bringing 
Frank Burns home when 
they welcome Larry 
Linville back to Fort 
Wayne, and they will still 
have those great parties out 
at Hoagland

Attraction" not attractive 



There were two things 1 
liked about "Fatal Attrac- 
tion" and there were two 
things I hated. They were 
the same two things— the 
pacing and the 
cinematography. 

Review 

The slowing of the 
movie's pace was brilliantly 
executed to build suspense. 
unfortunately, the rest of 
the film was conducted at a 
similar but ureffective fine- 
that -w a s-nice-but-E -sure- 
hope -something-else- 
happens- soon pace "At- 
traction" seemed like it was 
happening in real time. I 
felt I had spent four hours 
watching a two-hour ti^ovie. 

Likewise the cine- 
matography was at times 
brilliant but at other times f 
wished 1 could have (old the 
director of photography to 
lock the camera to a tripod 
and leave it alone. 

Someone told me to do all 
non-movie things (e.g. 
snacks, bathroom) before 
the film started because 1 
would be glued to my seat 
during the entire show I 
was disappointed. For only 
the second time in my rec- 



ollection I felt 1 could have 
gone out for some M&amp;Ms in 
the middle of the movie. 
The first such time was at 
the epic dud, "Dune." 

A few — a very few- 
— suspenseful moments 
broke the grinding mo- 
notony. The monotony could 
have stood a little more 

The main problems were 
not, however, any fault of 
the actors. Michael Douglas 
was quite believable as the 
guilty-party -turned-victim 
of a weekend frolic and the 
object of the torments of 



Glenn Close. Close ("The 
Big Chill") excelled as the 
scorned woman whom hell- 
halh-no-fury like. And what 
a fury she hath 

Taking the efforts of the 
lead actors and the could- 
ha ve-been-done -better plot 
and adding to it proper 
pacing and a tripod or two, 
this film could have been 
what people are led into 
believing it already 
is— good.
