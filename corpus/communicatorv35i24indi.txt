David Brooks addresses 
concern over national debt 



By Stephen Pepple 

sp e ppl e@ip fwcotn m u n ka t o r. o i 



Author and New York Times columnist, [&gt;,i- 
vid Brooks, warned of national trouble because 
of the goven ins growing ilebi, but was op- 
timistic about the ability of Americans to ad- 
dress this potential crisis in his lecture to over 
200 hundred people at last Thursday's cJmnibus 
Lecture. 

"Countries fail because they get indebted." 
Brooks said, "and Social Security and Medicare 
are going to crush us." 

Brooks is the hOuse conservative at the 
New York Times, where he writes a biweekly op- 
ed column. He also is a regular analyst on the 
News Hour with Jim Lehrer. 

Brooks explained that the nation's deficit 
along with an inability to pay for entitlement 
programs like Social Security ,ini! Medicare will 
become a crucial problem for the next genera- 
tion. "We are spending are kids' money," Brooks 



According to Brooks, this polarization h,is 
damaged the political process. "There is no 
middle political class, because the center has no 
money," he said. 

Brooks further maintained that normal 
people could resolve many of the problems that 
divide Washington. Considering this, Brooks 
suggested the emergence of a successful third 
party in American politics may become a pos- 
sibility in the next few decades. 

Although it is a ways off. Brooks said that 
his next book will probably deal with these is- 
sues in the political climate.

A partnership of almost 
msumer groups with (he 



ana, is a push to make access to 
prescription medications free 
or significantly discounted for 
eligible Indiana residents. 

Governor Mitch Daniels 
announced the launch of Rx 
for Indiana on March 8, thank- 
ing the companies and orga- 
nizations who have made the 
program possible. 

Prescription assistance 
programs have existed in the

The creation of Rx for 
Indiana is intended to build 
upon the national success of 
these existing pharmaceutical

In the past, departments

The GAO report was is-

the decline, to changing visa

accessibility, and requests for 
data error corrections have de-

Personal rights versus the quality of life 



The 15-year h.it ik- for ihc lite of I t-rri Schiavo 
has raised painful, heart-wrenching questions in the 
public forum. Though it sounds callous, the ques- 
tion at the center of the debate concerning Schiavo 
is that of worth: when one becomes incapaci- 
tated, of what degree is a persons life worth living? 
Furthermore, is it better to live in an incapacitated 
state, or is it better lo simply die? At the time that 
this paper goes to press, Schiavo is currently starving 
to death in a Florida hospice facility after her feeding 
tube was removed on Friday, March 18. According 
to a story from Bloomherg.com, "The U.S. Senate 
voted in a hastily convened Sunday session to allow 
the case of Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged Florida 



woman, to be placed under federal review." The law- 
makers will be debating a bill designed to keep her 
alive while her case is being reviewed, according to 
the Bloomberg report. 

Each medical case is unique, but the Schiavo 
case has certainly taken several interesting turns. 
On March 12 of this year, Tern's husband Michael 
Schiavo refused a Californian businessman's offer of 
$1 million to allow his wife to live. Her husband and 
Tern's family are divided on the issue, with the fam- 
ily Firmly believing that Terri may one day recover. 
"Please, please, please save my little girl," said the 
mother of Terri Schiavo, according to an Associated 
Press report. 



However, the woman's husband wants to allow 
her to die. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, 
"Michael Schiavo has said his wife told him she 
would not want to live like this." 

The discussion over this issue is not often in the 
public consciousness. Now should be the time for 
individuals and families to discuss the options of a 
living will, and to determine what measures should 
be taken in the event of a tragic occurrence like that 
of Schiavo's, Though the personal-rights debate will 
not be setded with any ruling on this court case, per- 
haps some good can come from this heartbreaking 
dilemma if it incites a thoughtful public dialogue on 
the subject.

Losing its edge: Rap music going soft 

As the World Turns 



Why Rap Sucks, Part I 

As I pondered what to write for this 
week's column, I kept getting distracted 
by basketball and drunken lack Russell 
terriers. Yes, it's true, I must admit I got 
a dog drunk this weekend. It was funny at 
first, but then kind of pathetic. Apparently 
dogs can't taste vodka when it's mixed with 
fruit punch. They just run around in a big 
circle, fall over and lose control of their 
bowels. Like 1 said, funny, yet sad. 



1 promise that 1 did i 
Honest. Please believe me. 

Anyway, as I was saying, sometime 
around the moment 1 watched the dog run 
into the dishwasher, it occurred to me that 
my topic this week would be rap music. 
I have no idea how and/or why rap is 
related to dogs, but you'll have that. What 
I'd like to say is this: rap music is in a state 
of creative disarray. Actually, if we really 
want to get technical about it, I'd have to 
say it pretty much sucks right now. 

Go to any club, or turn on any urban 
music station, and you'll hear the same 
garbage recycled over and over again. It's 
music for those who want to be hard, but 
yet can't quite pull it off very well. 

And so the conundrum reveals itself: 
where did good rap music go? More impor- 
tantly, who killed rap, and why? 

Let's tackle the last question first. 



Now. in all fairness, I've got to admit that 
I've always been a fan of gangster rap, or 
whatever term defines rap that talks about 
the three most important topics of rap: 
violence, hos and lots and lots of drug 
usage and distributorship. I like my rap 
mean and vicious. I don't like happy rap. 



And I especially can't stand hip-hop. But

Vivica Fox isn't a bad consolation 
prize, but we all knew she was slumming

I apologize for the digression. As I 



was saying, [a Rule's debut album, "Vcnni 
Vetti Vecci" was hard, no lie. It had some 
nice tracks on it, and people thought we 
had a new badass on our hands, However, 
as Lee Corso would say, "Not so fast, my 
friend." It seems la had a hankering to 
team up with every single female R.&amp;B 
artist on the planet. I guess he needed 
to make sure everybody knew that even 
thugs cry. and he was the most goll-darned 
sensitive of all the hard-core thug rappers. 

Nobody hates Ja because he wants to 
be 'Pac. We hate him because he's a wuss. 
See, hardcore rap says that if you're gonna 
be a badass, you've gotta keep everyone 
away from you except for God and your 
mama. Ills like Snoop said, "We don't love 
them hos," Well, apparently Ja just didn't 
get the memo because he runs around 
constantly letting us know how much he 
misses his boo, 

I love you baby, blah blah blah, yada 
yada yada, etcetera, etcetera. Now, I know 
Nelly did that song a while ago around 
thinking of you when I'm with my boo 
and all that, but die point remains that Ja 
went from "Kill "Em All" to "Put It On Me" 
in a little over a year. Life must be good 
for him. If it's that good, stop pretending 
you're hard! You're not. 

The aforementioned drunk dog could 
probably kick your ass, given the fact you're 
constantly high. And then he says that he's 
probably going to get murdered one of 
these days. Take my advice: stop making 
music and you'll have no worries. 

And it would nice as well if 50 Cent 
(and the name is so appropriate given 
that's about all I'd pay for an album of his) 
would just stop beefing. That would be 
phenomenal. No one likes Ja Rule, We 
understand you hate him. too. We get the 
picture. Shut up! 



Satan is a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle 



Vance's Views 



The dark prince has arrived. 

Yes, Satan has arrived on the plan- 
et earth in the form of a turtle shell. At 
least, that is what a pet storeowner in 
Michigantown Jndiana is claiming. 

So over in Michigantown, a turtle 
named Lucky survived a fire. He was the 
only pet at Bryan Dora's pet-store "Dora's 
A-Dora-ble Pet Shop" to survive a recent 
fire. And now, crazy Bryan Dora thinks that 
you can see the image of Satan on the back 
of the turtle's shell. 

Now. I can go with the fire depart- 
ment's assessment that the heat caused the 
shell to warp, but that the fire brought Satan 
out in the turtle is pretty hard to believe. 
Why don't we call the rapper Houston and 
compare notes about the devil taking over. 

Anyone? 

For anyone who has not seen the 
post-fire photo of Lucky the Turtle, let me 



fill you in. Dora claims that he can now 
see facial features, including a goatee and 
horns on the shell. But to me, it looks more 
like a cow. 

And for any reader who has seen a 
Kevin Smith directed movie, the image 
looks for like Mooby, the ill-worshiped tele- 



store owner that must ftave inhaled a few 
too many of the fire fumes himself. Did 
anyone think to psychologically evaluate 



"The marking on the shell was like 
the devil wanted us to know he was down 
there," Dora said in his CNN debut. "To 
me, it's too coincidental that the only thing 



So, I am opening up a small, unof- 
ficial poll to our readers Do we believe that 
Bryan Dora is completely stupid, seeking

their website, it seems like Dora is just 
another picture of the average republi 



t unscathed would have this 



Michigantown averaged .7 shoppers per 
day before the fire and exposure due to the 
'satan shell.' And now he probably gets 
least twenty a day who just want to see t 
stupid turtle. 

I think I am going to go light my hand 
on fire, then claim that I can see Jesus. 
Maybe then CNN will do a story about me. 

Heck, I need the publicity. 



Homosexuals, serial killers and the Boy Scouts 

Staff Column 



I would like to commend the Boy 
Scouts of America. It turns out that they 
are not as discriminatory as first thought. 
They have a long standing ban on gay 



But it turns out that they have no such 
ban on serial killers. They are allowed full 
benefits and privileges. 

BTK, a self-named serial killer in the 
Wichita, Kansas area has been captured 
after over 3D years of investigating. 

His original name came from none 
other than himself as he taunted authori- 
ties in the 1970s. BTK stands for "Bind, 
Torture and Kill." That is what he did to all 
of his victims, man and women. 

But the icing on the cake is the fact 
that Dennis L Rader was, of all things, a 
Cub Scout Leader. 

I don't know about most of the people 
in this country, but I would definitely prefer 



The Boy Scouts of America really need 
to rethink their blatantly discriminatory 
policy on homosexuals. How can they hon- 
esdy look anyone in the face and claim that 
they ban homosexuals for the "safety" of 
our children. What? 

? safety of our children should have 



i the only dangerously violent 
acting as a Cub Scout leader, think again. 

According to the National Crime 
Statistics, heterosexual men are more often 
likely to become violent and, in turn, dan- 
gerous. Homosexual men, traditionally are 
not considered violent. Most FBI profiles 
of serial killers lead authorities to hetero- 

So, I am not sure why the "safety" of 
our children is in such good hands with the 
heterosexual men, if on a statistical average 



kucK ridiculous. At 
Scouts are obviously having a hard time 
finding good help, why are they throwing 
out one whole group of people based on 
their sexual orientation? 

Homosexual people can lead a den 
meeting just as well as anyone else. They 
are as nurturing and as loving as everyone 
else, and apparendy safer too. But the Boy 
Scouts insist that the safety of our kids 
comes first. Well, if the leader in my area is 
anything like BTK. I will definitely pass up 
the Boy Scout experience for my kids for 
the simple fact that I refuse to be associ- 
ated with anyone who discriminates. What 
kind of message is that sending our kids? 
Love your neighbors, except the gay ones?

attention, but his or her belief. 
Unless you accept the premise,

The Butterfly Effect, The Jacket 
nevertheless has the capacity 
lo provoke thought and con- 



1 appreciate the way the 
story is developed, taking audi- 
ences into The Twilight Zone, 
but not leaving them stranded 



there. The Jacket toys with time 
travel in a way that shouldn't 
confuse too many viewers, and 
it addresses the often discussed 
paradox of how an action in 
the past can wipe out an infin- 
ity of possible futures. And, 
while M.ivhury's style

which seems perfect for a slow- 
burn production of this nature. 
The Jacket opens in 
199J Iraq, with the Gulf War in 
full swing. Jack Starks (Adricn 
Brody) gets the back of his head 
blown open when he lets down 
his guard. He is initially left for 
dead - in fact, his voiceover 
informs us. "I was 27 the first 
time I died" - but doctors soon 
realize their mistake. A year 



hitchhikes a ride from anoth-

- it results in Jack becoming 
involved in a shooting, and end- 
ing up confined to the Alpine 
Grove Psychiatric Hospital for 
the criminally insane. He has 
entered the cuckoo's nest. 

A maverick doctor, Dr. 
Becker (Kris Krlstofferson). 
begins experimenting on Jack, 
confining him in a straightjack- 
et and (rapping htm inside a 
morgue drawer. The intent of 
the experiment: to "reset his 
violent proclivities." The justifi- 
cation: "You can't break some- 
thing that's already broken." The 
result: somehow (the "whys" 



and "wherefores" are thank- 
fully left unexplained), Jack 
travels through time to 2007, 
15 years in the future. There, he 
encounters the future version 
of Jackie (Keira Knightley). the 
girl he rescued by the roadside 
all those years ago. Not only 
does he begin a romance with 
Jackie, but he embarks upon a 
desperate quest to save his own 
life. According to 2007 news 
reports, he died on January 1,

film's goal is to encourage us 
to contemplate the reality of 
Jack's world, whether the trips 
to the future are actually hap-

old argument: predestination 
vs. free will. Maybury litters the 
movie with red herrings (such 
as the green beads that more

order to vary the number of 
possible interpretations.

They conquered everything 
but death. 

Past rulers like Alexander the Great, Tutankhamen and Augustus Caesar all have one thing in 
common: the past. They're stuck in it. Doesn't it make more sense to follow somone wholias 
conquered death? Jesus Christ accomplished what no ruler ever could. He paid the penalty 
for our sin. And by rising bodily from the grave, he conquered death — not only for himself 
but for us. Listen to whathe said: "He who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has 
eternal life; he does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life." (John 5:24) 

Jesus conquered death. Would you like to know what else he's capable of conquering in your 

life? Read the section called "John" in the Bible, or see the feature article Beyond Blind Faith

■ Mastodons split games over weekend against Valparaiso, team improves record to 9 - 6 on the season 



A home and home weekend pair of games turned 
into a single-day doulileheacler he. anse of inclement 
weather condition', .it Valparaiso's and IPFW's home 
fields. 

In games played at ncuu.il [hitler University in 
Indianapolis on Sunday, March 20. the Mastodons 
won the first game of a doubleheader. 10-5. but lost 
the second, 8-2. 

A five-run fourth inning in game one fueled by 
five Mastodon singles and sloppy Crusader fielding 
put IPFW up 6-2. Junior catcher Brent Doty knocked 
in Tyler Fowler to lie it at two. 

Valparaiso pitcher I Lave v \t;rgin committed an 
error, allowing Sean Kirk, who had singled earlier in 
the inning, to score an unearned run. 



Eric Steinbacb knocked in the final run of the inning, 
Walton, on a single. 

"Doty got a big base hit for us and really got us 
going," IPFW head coach Billy Gernon said. "It was 
cold and I didn't think the sennne, was going to be as 
high as it was. It was just a really solid inning for gs 
and everyone contributed." 

IPFW starter Eric Lambert had given up just two 
runs on five hits in the first four innings, but began to 
labor in the fifth. 

He walked the first batter he faced and hit the 
next. Cole Uebelhor replaced him and allowed three 
runs, two charged to Lambert. Valparaiso was back in 



e poor Crusader play.

"He was a hard-luck pin. her last year and just

Improved offense, defense and base running

Despite playing on a soil and sloppy held, IPFW

Valparaiso committed eight. • 



Pechota behind the 
times in fashion 



In All Directions 



The second bracket is for assistant coaches. And 
who sits at the No. 14 seed in the Midwest? Our own 
interim head coach Joe Pechota. 

But by some conspiracy, Coach P was knocked 
out in the first round by Rodney Terry of Texas. And by 
that, lam appalled. 

Now, it is one thing to have a fashion contest held 
by a college basketball website. And, yes, it is a very 
horrible thing. But to deny one of the best-dressed 
coaches in college basketball a first round win is the 
worst piece of hrackctolngy I have seen all year. 

I, for one, should not be allowed to critique fash- 
ion in any way. After all, there was a reason that this 
paper did away with its twice-yearly "Fashion Special 
Section." But if there is ,i beacon ol fashion at IPFW, it

the "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" type of way. 

And that alone should make him a member of the 
Best Dressed Final Lour, and definitely not eliminated 
in the first round. 

• the people at Collegelnsider. 



If the media holds Joe Pechotas fashion down, 
they can hold the Mastodons down. And how fair is 
that for anyone at IPFW? 

During my brief comparison between Pechota 
and Terry (his round one competition), I see that 
IPFW's coach should be a fat and away winner. There 
is nothing special about Coach Terry and his choice of 
clothing.
