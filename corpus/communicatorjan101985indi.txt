Fori Wayne native James Schaller,

"1 wanted lo come up with new

spent more than a year researching 
and traveling throughout 
the stale la talk to placement direc- 
tors. He says he applied Ideas from 
fields such as marketing, advertising 
and psychology lo tbe Job-hunting 

"All research shows Ihe number one 

problem in Job hunting is rejection."

CoUege maturity factor in lower DWI arrest 



By CRAIG NIX 

Staff Wrller 

It might seem Inappropriate to bring 
up the subject o( drinking and driving 
on Jan 10. Holiday celehrsllons are 
over for most butalcoholconsumpLon 
does not end when the holiday season 
does And when people drink they all 
too cften drive as well 

Sergeant Denharlag of the campus 
police says there have been few 
prohlemj concerning student drinking 
al IPFW in Ihe past. He said this is 
probablyduelo Ihe higher average age 
c/ Ihe lUidenls, which translates into a 
greater degree of responsibility 

A similar view is held by Martin 
Bender o( Ihe Fort Wayne Police He 
sees college students' maturity as a 
major faclor in tbe lower number of 
arrests for alcc^ol violations. Unof- 
ficial slallslics show only one c&lt; every

Penalties for first offenders are also 
seen as a delerenl to dnuik driving. 
Tlie offender's driver's license is 
usually suspended tor at least six

Students could aid starving 



Pari of the rtaion for the big al- 
tracllon lo Cabbage Patch dolls a [heir 
unlqucnaa Each chubby-cheeked, 
slarry-eycd llllle darhng It tupposedly 
untlfce any other, and people pay a lot of 
money In beamung Ihe select Few loown 

On the other hand, children dying in 
pain and fear from (he ravage* of 
hunger all look prelly much alike. You 
nee one child's gauni face with dark, 
hollow eyn and you've teen them all. 
Bill Ju&lt;il one look into the ccnibic lace of 
a hard-won Cabbage Patch Kid lets 
nwncra know Ihcy have something really 

So. why give money (o the Africa 
Kuminu Kelief Campaign the Red Cross 
Is sponsoring'' Sure. Ihere are starving 
people in the world, but why should a 
collcgcsludcnl (eel obligaledlo sacrifice 
his or htr rrt/n hard-earned money to 
pursueKUchafuUk' purpose as feeding a 
starving world? 

There arc at least three very good 
reasons E-'lrst. college students ere 
human - starving Ethiopian people are 
human. That alone should sulfice. 

But if that doesn't move an apathetic 
studenl, maybe the second reason will. 
ItlK not futile. It only takes twadollars to 
feed a starving child for an entire 
month— $90 will feed an entire village. If 
\t\v price of lunch for a single day is too 
much lo spare lo save somebody's life, 
then n hungry child will die today at the 
expense of a single trip to McDonald's. 



If every student and faculty member 
at [PFW sent just two dollars lo the 
Africa Ftelief Campaign in care of Ihe 
Red Cross, 1.000 people could eat for an 
entircyear Many peoptecoutd be saved 
from a horribly painFul death by star- 
vation If Just the people on Ihis campus 
decide Uiat a human life is a more 
worthy cause than a Big Mac and fries 

But for each one who lacks the 
motivation (surely nobody bcks the 
human decency or compas3ian&gt; one 
little bay or girl wdl not survive the 
month of January. 

If neither one of these reasons is good 
enough tu really make an individual 
iLslen to his hearl, then he might try 
listening lo his stomach. 

Just for one day he should go wilhoul 
food The gnawing pain and light- 
teadedncss he would invariably ex- 
perience would only be the slightest 
indication of what It must feel like to 
starve to death. 

Let's sec. if your average black- 
market Cabbage Patch Kid goes for 
around 180, that would be enough to feed 
a real, live three-year-old In Ethiopia 
unUI August of 1991. 

Actually, all Cabbage Patch Kids tend 
(0 look alike. And word has it their heads 
pop off anyway. 

But the plastic children continue to 
flourish in this part of the world The 
real, hve. truly uniqucchildren a " 

in Ethiopia And they are dying 



Resolution to combat apathy 



Ti.s the season to start breaking New 
Year's resolutions. Well, there's one 
campits-wlde goal for 19B5 whiI^h each 
Individual ought lo take seriously: "The 
students, faculty and slaff of IPFW 
hereby resolve to slop whining and start 
ncling, " 

Commuter campus or not. the apathy 
level here Is phenomenal. Who knows 
what Is going on around hcre^ Who has a 
gripe they would like to air? Who would 
like lo see some positive action taken to 
Improve parking, gel a new Fine Arts 
Facility, Improve campus security, or 
oven somcthlngas mundane as fixing all 
the blasted clocks? Who cares? 

Well if anything Is going to get do 
around here in 19B&amp;, everyone needs to 
not only care, but get Involved as well. 
Each person on this campus has an 
opinion about something. But opinions 
dan't accomplish anything; whining Is 
only irritating to those who have to listen 
to 11. People who whihe oimlcssly are 
Just generally Irritating. People who 
whine with direction — now they get 

So why are there so few people taking 
action? Because It's hopeless? Or time- 
consuming'' Or somebody else's 
problem'' 

It's not hopeless. Take the COM 334 
class last semester, for example. The 
students felt the university had slighted 



them by charging a S2S lab fee 
class which the students said had no lab. 
When they appealed lo the department 
Ihcy were told it was an unfortunate 
situation, but nothing could be done to 
secure a refund for them 

They could have slopped there, but 
Ihey didn't. They drew up a petition and 
were prepared to push Ihe issue as far as 
Ihey had to. Once the administration 
realized the students were not about lo 
give in, all the red tape miraculously 
melted away. 

They got their money back. And the 
situation prompted a campus-wide in- 
vesbgation into the a&amp;°iessment of lab 

Itwasnoian^asy task, andycsjt.looh 
awhile Bulafter awhile, thetsabecame 
more Ihan just money It became a 
symbol to everyone on campus that 
positive change is possible if somebody 
wants it bad enough to make it happen 
And it also made people realize 
"somebody else's problem" could effect 
them in the long run 

In I9SS it would be wonderful if 
everyone could keep all their 
resolutions. IPFW would be a campus 
full of physically fit people and 
breathably smoke-free air But even 
belter than than, the squeaky wheels on 
this campus would squeak loud enough 
to gel some oil, and IPFW might finally 
go somewhere
