NEWS BRIEFS 

POLICE SEEK STUDENT HELP 
TO IDENTIFY SUSPECT 

Campus police have had four or five reports of 
indecent exposure. Paul Strouts, interim chief of 
police and director of safety, requests that students 
with information about the suspect contact the 
campus police. 

Sgt. Thomas Haner said they are looking for a 
white maie in his mid to late 20s. The suspect is 
approximately 6-feet tall, weighing 170-185 
pounds. He has long sandy brown hair and a 
mustache. 

Haner said that he has been seen in or around a 
large white or cream-colored car. The car has sev- 
eral dents and a lot of rust. One report said the car 
was possibly an early model Monte Carlo or 
Oldsmobile. 



IPSGA SET TO IMPEACH 
TRUANT SENATE, SAB MEMBERS 

Impeachment proceedings have been initiated 
against student senators and student activities 
board members who have violated the IPSGA 
attendance policy. 

Voting IPSGA members are to meet on Friday, 
April 10 to vote on impeachment for truant repre- 
sentatives. 

Attendance policy is uniform for senators and 
SAB members. IPSGA by-laws state that they 
may be removed from their offices after four or 
more absences. 

According to student senate attendance records, 
seven of the fifteen active senators have four or 
more absences, including Chad Downey with 
recorded seven unexcused absences, Robert 
Murray with unexcused absences from six meet- 
ings, and Seemab Rasheed, recently elected 
IPSGA vice president of finance, with five unex- 
cused absences. 

Attendance records were kept for 17 senate 
meetings, dating back to Oct. 10, 1991. No atten- 
dance records were available for SAB meetings. 

Frazier-Henry claims that IPSGA has been crip- 
pled by poor attendance. "Student senate can't 
make quorum, and SAB hasn't made quorum all 
semester," said Frazier-Henry. "What are we to 
do? IPSGA can't conduct business anymore." 

John Weisenberger, vice president of legislation, 
concurs, "Maybe this will show everyone that the 
executive branch is finally getting serious about 
(Attendance)." 

Lisa Onz, vice president of student activities has 
reservations about the impeachment proceedings. 
Onz agrees that SAB attendance should be 
reviewed, "because everyone else is being 
burdened." 

Onz claims that SAB functions because of coop- 
eration between voting members and volunteers. 
Onz said that "I was never able to fulfill the 20- 
seat requirement" set down by the IPSGA 
constitution. 

"If we don't carry on business as usual," Onz 
said, "events fall flat on their face." 



CAMPUS POLICE INSTALLS 
EMERGENCY PHONES 

IPFW police have installed eleven emergency 
phones around campus. 

GTE still needs to add the phones to IPFW's 
lines, but police expect the phones to be opera- 
tional within two weeks, said Paul Strouts, interim 
chief of police and director of safety. 

The phones will work like an intercom system. 
A button on the post will connect the caller to the 
campus police. When the connection is made, the 
police will be able to locate the origin of the call. 

"There is no siren on the phone because we 
need the voice connection, but there is a big strobe 
light that should alert anyone in the area," said 
Strouts. 

The police will be able to speak through the 
intercom to give instructions and let the caller 
know how quickly an officer will be responding, 
according to Strouts. 



Unlike Congress, bad checks no problem at IPFW 



By June! Ausbury 
Staff Writer 

Bounced checks may be a 
scandal on Capitol Hill, but not 
at IPFW, as students rarely write 
or cash bad checks. 

"Maybe 25 or 30 individuals 
per semester, out of 12,000 stu- 
dents, bounce tuition checks." 
said bursar Pamela Michalcc. 
She added [hat perhaps five out 
of these 25-30 students arc with- 
drawn from classes because ihcy 
do not respond to notification 
regarding their bad checks. 

A S20 service fee is charged 
for each bad check. Students 



must pay this fee within 10 days 
lo avoid having their records 
encumbered. 

The number of students cash- 
ing bad personal checks is harder 
lo estimate because they arc 
scattered throughout the year, 
instead of occurring at a partic- 
ular deadline as bad tuition 
checks do. 

Students who cash bad checks 
must not only pay die S20 ser- 
vice fee but also pay back the 
amount given them by the bur- 
sar's office. 

Because so few students 
bounce checks, the bursar's 



office considers bad checks an 
inconvenience rather than a 
major problem. 

Michalcc emphasized that her 
office gives students the benefit 
of the doubt. "We don'ljusi drop 
them from classes," she said. 
Sometimes a check will bounce 
due to an error by the student's 
bank. If the bank notifies the 
bursar's office in writing of such 
a mistake, the S20 service fee is 
refunded to the student. 

Repeat offenders are an occa- 
sional problem. If they pay back 
what dicy owe, their privilege to 
write and cash checks at the bur- 



sar's office will not be suspend- 
ed. "And it is a privilege, not a 
right," said Michalcc. 

Students who bounce checks 
more than twice have their check 
privileges suspended for two 
years. After this period is up, the 
student may again write or cash 
checks at the bursar's office. 

If, after the initial two-year sus- 
pension, a student writes or cash- 
es another bad check, his or her 
check privilege is permanently 
revoked. This rarely happens, 
according lo Michalcc. 

When asked if police or legal 
action has ever been taken 



against students due to bad 
checks, Michalcc declined to 
comment. She did note that few 
if any students have complained 
about routine actions taken by 
the bursar's office, such as the 
S20 service fee or encumbrance 
of records. 

Michalcc encouraged students 
to contact the bursar's office as 
soon as possible after receiving 
notice that a check has bounced. 
"If we don't hear from them, wc 
can't help them," she said. "Wc 
want to work with students when 
there's a problem." 




Fuel tank records recovered, 
contamination was reported

Features Editor 

The Indiana Department of 

Environmental Management 
finally found a record of an 
IPFW report of a fuel tank con- 
tamination in their files, accord- 
ing to Don Fitzpatrick, an 
IDEM official. 

Fitzpatrick could not explain 
how the files were lost, and then 
suddenly recovered, but he said 
the soil contamination was 
reported. 

"Our reports show [hat the soil 
was tested and the tests came 
back below toxic levels. It was 
what wc call old, weathered 
petroleum thai was probably 
very old," explained Fitzpatrick. 

The soil tests, which were con- 
ducted by Purdue-West 
Lafayette, revealed a pctroleum- 
bascd product had leaked into 
the ground under the current 
constructionsiteof the Engineer- 
ing and Technology Building. 

Because of the petroleum in 
the soil, Fitzpatrick said the uni- 
versity had several options of 
disposal to choose from. Among 
the choices, he said IPFW could 
have landfillcd the soil, or 
spread ii out thinly for the gases 
to evaporate inio the atmos- 



Communication students help create 
Nasca Lines documentary to air soon 



By Mary Shrock 
Staff Writer 

There is a 600-foot lizard in 
the desert sand of Nasca. 
South America. 

Among such friends as a mon- 
key with a tail 20 miles in diam- 
eter and a larger than life bird, 
â– he lizard is a line drawing in the 
sands of a desert 

No one is certain how the lines 
got there or why ihe mysterious 
lines of Nasca exist. But for 
anyone who has seen them, it is 
quickly evident that these lines 
go beyond mere drawings in 
the sand. 

Terry Doren, host of the col- 
lege cable access program 
Thcaier For Ideas, learned from 
a fan [hat a woman named Maria 
Rciche was studying the lines. 

"I was interested in Maria right 
away and so I decided to go to 
South America to see her." 
said Dorcn. 

Rciche weni to South America 
from Germany during the sec- 
ond world war. 

Dorcn said Reichc left 
Germany because of the hate 
in her country during the 
war years. 

While living in Lima, Peru, 
Reiche met the scientist who 
discovered Ihe Nasca lines. It 
was at this time lhat Rciche took 
over and began a forty year love 
affair with studying and preserv- 
ing the lines. 

"Maria has tried to stop people 
from ruining ihe lines ... and she 
even tried lo stop Ihe govern- 
ment when they decided to build 
a highway through one of the 
lizard designs," said Doren. 

During his time with Rciche, 
Dorcn made a documentary of 
her work with the Nasca lines 
and her life in South America. 

The program was aired on 
Channel 6 on April 6; and will 
be shown again at 1 and 8 p.m. 
on May 11. 

During Doren's two weeks in 
South America he visited Cusco, 
Lima, Nasca, lea and Machu 
Pichu, or the lost city of 
ihe Incas. 



The Nasca lines arc so big that 
one of its spiral designs is 80 
miles in diameter. 

The figures arc so immense 
they arc only visable from 
above. 

Il wasn't until 1952, however, 
that Rcicbc goi her first flight 
over the lines. 

She had viewing lowers con- 
structed so the public can look 
at the lines. 

According lo Doren, Reichc is 
a highly respected citizen among 
Peruvian people. She was once 
voted the most honored citizen 
and has her own foundation. 

"Maria is a great admirer of the 
Indians," said Doren, "she loves 
the simplicity and harmony of 
Indian life." 

It is possible that the ancestors 
of the very people Rciche lives 
with, could have created the 
Nasca lines more than 3,000 
years ago. 

"Nobody knows how the lines 
got there," said Dorcn. 

Scientists have been asking 
why the lines exist since their 
discovery in the 1940s. 

Phyllis Pilugh, senior astron- 
omer at the Adlcr Planetarium in 
Chicago is taking over Reiche's 
work, Pilugh has her own ideas 
about why the lines arc there. 

Dorcn said Pillugh believes 
the lines arc astronomical and 



related to the seasons. He said 
Pillugh thinks ihe Inca's created 
the lines as a part of iheir mysti- 
cal beliefs. 

Other people have their own 
theories about why the lines arc 
in Nasca. 

Mary Scarbrough, assistant 
producer of Doren's documen- 
tary said, "They're so large. It 
has to be some kind of a spirit 
that clched it. It's a way that 
spirit's were communicating." 

Another person involved as an 
editor of the documentary, Jim 
Everill said, "I've heard they're 
landing strips for unidentified 
flying objects." 

Whether the lines arc reli- 
gious or aesthetic in nature, they 
arc most definitely marvels 
of design. 

According to Doren they are 
set up in patterns of correspond- 
ing relationships. Monkey's, 
bird's and lizard's which arc all 
animals: All representing some 
different meaning and purpose 
for the people who created [hem. 

Maria Reiche is now blind and 
can no longer look at the lines 
[hat she helped preserve. But 
with Phyllis Pillugh, Reiche's 
work will be carried on. 

Perhaps someday wc will find 
out the who, what and why of 
the Nasca lines. 




phcrc. IPFW chose to air out the 
din. He added this was a vol- 
untary action done by the 
university. 

"It appears that the university 
has not violated any regulations 
or requirements," added 
FilzpaBick. 

However, a source who 
requested anonymity said he 
questions IPFW's methods. He 
works with environmental inves- 
tigations and remediation of 

"It appears that the university

or any requirements" 
â– Don Fitzpatrick, 
IDEM official 

petroleum-rclaied spills. 

Through his work the source 
said he has become familiar with 
Federal regulations pertaining to 
petroleum-contaminated soil. He 
said these types of spills are con- 
sidered a "special waste", which 
means they require specific 
methods of disposal. 

"This waste material must be 
disposed of at a licensed solid 
waste disposal facility. I ques- 
tion whether the area selected 
for soil disposal is a licensed 



waste disposal facility," the 
source said. 

Stuart Kline, head of radiologi- 
cal and environmental manage- 
ment at Purduc-Wcst Lafaycitc, 
already confirmed the soil was 
not dumped in a licensed 
facility. 

Kline said IPFW dumped the 
dirt on the IPFW-owned McKay 
farm across the river. 

Kline said, according to his 
documents, the contractor was 
approved to spread out the dirt 
for evaporation on the 
McKay site. 

The anonymous source said 
although surface treatment of 
contaminated soil is an accepted 
remedial alternative, "the trcat- 
mem area must be properly con- 
sulted and monilored to pre- 
vent surface run off, ircspass- 
ing, etc." 

After the soil is disposed of, 
the anonymous source said, the 
soil in the area must be sampled 
to confirm a reduction in petro- 
leum content. He said tests and 
test results musL be forwarded to 
the slate for evaluations. 

IDEM had no response as to 
any soil contamination up- 
dates and continuous testing 
regulations. 



These figures make up part of the Nasca tines seen in a locally 
produced documentary. 



Disabled students say facilities 
at IPFW lack accessibility 



By Mike Wade 
News Editor 

IPFW students with disabili- 
ties are quick to voice their 
opinions on what the university 
could do to improve accessibil- 
ity on campus. 

Several students relayed a 
story of a woman who was 
recently trapped in Kettler 
Hall. 

The woman, who uses a 
wheel chair, was on the top 
floor of Keitler when the 
building was evacuated 
because of a bomb threat. 

In case of a bomb threat or a 
fire, the elevators arc shut 
down. The woman had no way 
to get out of the building. 

Two men ended up carrying 
her down the steps and out of 
the building. 

The woman could not be con- 
lacted for comment. 

Randall Borst, director of the 
office of Services for Students 
with Disabilities, said that the 
incident was not solitary. 

"It is not ihe only lime such a 
thing has occurred," he said. 

Borst said he wroie a plan to 
handle evacuations, and the 
issue will be re-addressed 
when the chancellor appoints a 
new director of safety. 

Lenn Fiedler, a student who 
has a sight impairment, voiced 
a complaint of his own. He 
said the room number plaques 
need to be moved. 

"Each semester I humble 
myself and have someone walk 
me around and point out the 
room numbers. Having the 
numbers at about eye level in 
raised lettering would be an 
improvement to mc," he said. 

Borst said the university is 
looking into changing the 
room numbers. 

"A blind person should be 
able to find the room number 
without feeling all over the 
wall," said Borst 

Students with learning dis- 
abilities face problems of their 
own. One such student said 
she wanted Ihe location of the 
DASEL office changed. 

"A loi of the students who 
use the office have attention 



span deficits. 

"The fraternities are right 
down the hall. They make a lot 
of noise. They're not doing 
anything wrong, but it can be a 
big distraction," she said. 

The student wanted to remain 
anonymous because she was 
afraid people would think she 
was a iroublc- maker. 

"I have loo many problems 
now. I don't want a professor 
reading this and thinking,' Oh. 
She's the one,'" she said. 

Many people don't recognize 
ihe existence of learning dis- 
abilities, she said. 

"I had one professor basically 
lell mc that if I saw a psycholo- 
gist, my disability would go 
away. Lots of people refuse to 
believe thai I have a disabili- 
ty," she said. 

Borst agreed that many peo- 
ple arc ignorant about learn- 
ing disabilities. 

"People with learning disabil- 
ities have a very hard time 
because the disability is so 
invisible. Many don't recog- 
nize learning disabilities as dis- 
abilities," said Borst. 

Another problem lhat affects 
students with disabilities is the 
fire doors in Kettler Hall, 
said Borst. 

The basement entrance to the 
building has electronic door 
openers which open the outside 
doors. Students in wheelchairs 
can get into Ihe stairwell but 
cannot get through the second 
set of doors. 

"I've already addressed that 
matter with the Physical Plant. 
The inside doors are lo be left 
open. Otherwise the building is 
inaccessible. Wc can't have 
that," said Borst. 

The university is working on 
a three-year plan to correct 
whatever problems they can, 
according to BorsL 

The plan should be done by 
July 26. 

"We're not done; that's for 
sure. We've got some serious 
problems lo work out," said 
Borst.

America can not pay 
for capitalist Russia 



Last week President Bush made 
his first major foreign- policy initia- 
tive in three months. On Wednesday, 
April 1, Bush and German chancel- 
lor Helmut Kohl announced that 
some $24 billion in financial credits, 
loan guarantees and increased allot- 
ments to the International Monetary 
Fund to help stabilize the Russian 
economy. 

The $24 billion total is to be 
divided up between the seven major 
industrialized democracies, with the 
U.S. shouldering one-fifth of the 
total cost of the package. 

$18 billion is earmarked for new 
loans and debt deferral. $6 billion 
has been set aside to stabilize the 
weak ruble. 

$24 billion is not a lot of money, 
when dealing with the huge, multi- 
faceted economy of the free 
republics. Indeed, it is something of 
a low-risk venture for the Bush 
administration. The U.S. side of the 
program consists primarily of loan 
guarantees, credits, and the freeing 
of money to give to the International 
Monetary Fund. None of these out- 
lays require new spending of federal 
dollars. Therefore, it's a move that's 
easily defended in an election year. 

The very fact that this program is 
being created now, in an election 
year, that is significant. American 
voters are very skeptical about 
extending foreign aid while the 
American economy is slumping. 
Part of Bush's foreign policy silence 
this winter is proof of conservative 
GOP contender Patrick Buchanan's 
success at exploiting that fear. 

So Bush has sent out the signal 
that foreign aid will continue, even 
under domestic duress. Part of the 
government's need for immediate 
action was signals from Russia that 
its economic reforms of last 
December were going to be rolled 
back. 

Russia's government's proclama- 
tion that 1992 was to be a zero- 
deficit spending year was shown to 
be a pipe dream, as its first-quarter 
deficit total exceeded its deficit for 
the whole of 1991. The Russian gov- 
ernment jacked up energy prices to 
pay for energy-production costs. 
Would old-style price controls be 
next? 

President Bush has opted not to 
wait to find out, and that is his 
misstep. 

The current economic scene in 
Russia is bad, but from here it just 



gets worse. If the republics continue 
on the road to free-market capital- 
ism, inefficient and archaic factories 
will go under, throwing many out of 
work. Indeed, the Russian unem- 
ployment rate stands in excess of 
15%, from an artificially sustained 
rate of near zero under the 
Communist regime. 

The unemployment rate is going 
to go up from here. On the same 
Wednesday Bush and Kohl 
announced the new aid package, 
Yeltsin announced that the Russian 
army would be cut to 1.2 million 
troops from its current total of 3 mil- 
lion. That's 1.8 million soldiers, 
coming home to an already-bad job 
situation. 

The lifting of price controls has 
already made the quality of life for 
Russians bad. Though Russians have 
the rubles, the food and goods are 
not getting to the marketplace. 

President Bush then is left with two 
options in a worsening situation. On 
one hand, he can continue the stream 
of aid to help Russia on its road to a 
free market economy. 

The problem with that is, how 
deep are Russian problems going to 
be? Is the U.S. going to infuse cash 
to help the Russian economy at each 
painful stage of transition? What if 
the Yeltsin government isn't strong 
enough to oversee privatization 
beyond Moscow's borders, as has 
been suggested? Can he weather the 
hard times politically? 

It's a very dark hole to be throw- 
ing money into, especially when our 
own economy is in poor shape. 

The problems that Russia is expe- 
riencing now are the birth pangs of a 
capitalist economy. It will be some 
time before real markets appear 
there. 

Bush is left with the option on the 
other hand, and that is to wait and 
watch. Humanitarian aid to stave off 
disease and hunger should be the 
only offers extended. Throwing tax 
dollars at such a risky venture is bad 
economics. If Russia has the will to 
carry out the conversion, it can do so 
without American help. 

That is the option Bush should 
choose. 



Advisors won't play 
nursemaid to students 



To the editor: 

I have a Bachelor of Science degree in 
education ('77) and a Master of Science in 
education ('88). I am a candidate this semes- 
ter for a Master of Arts degree in English. I 
am teaching composition at IPFW (this is my 
fourth semester). 

I have had good advisors throughout this 
educational process. Mr. Wade, ihcir names 
arc Drs. Ken Keller, Julius SmuJkstys. Aurclc 
Violeilc, and John Brcnnan. 

However, none of these advisors ever told 
mc ihat I would get good grades if 1 didn't 
attend class (whether I was bored or not). 

I know students who have taken two lab 
courses in one semester. I myself have taken 
si* consecutive hours of class. It can be done 
and I would not want an advisor who told mc 
that 1 will not be able to do so. Students arc 



responsible for knowing their own strengths. 
If you arc a night owl, don't take morning 
classes. If you can't take more than three 
hours of consecutive classes, don't sign up for 
them. As far as students not coming back if 
their breaks are long enough to go home is 
concerned, students need to know if they arc 
prone to do this. If so, don't schedule long 
breaks. 

Advisors arc there to help us understand 
what courses fit what requirements. They arc 
nol there to hold our hands, manage our 
lifestyles, or to serve as surrogaic parents. 

Each student needs to be responsible for 
his or her own education. Primary school is 
over.

Student defends pro-life, punishment stances 



To the Editor: 

I am responding 10 die article, 
"New Angle on Abortion" thai 
Fayc Mohandespour wrolc in the 
March 5 issue. She stated, "... I 
was talking lo a Christian woman 
who is pro-life. However, she is 
also pro-capiial punishment ... I 
am hoping to discover if there are 
others oul there who fit ihis 
description ... I would have 10 say 
you arc hypocrilcs." I would like 
to explain why I believe ihis is not 
a hypocrisy. 

We boih agree, Faye, that 
killing a liny unborn baby is clear- 
ly murder. I find ii interesting that, 
according lo die Alan Guttinacher 
Institute (the research arm of 
Planned Parenthood), more lhan 
95 percent of children killed by 
abortion arc killed for reasons of 
convenience; not incest, nol rape, 
not the physical condition of the 
unborn, and not the threatened 
health of the mother. 



I 8 



/iih what Chai 



Swindoll wrote in a Focus on the 
Family publication, "The pathetic 
tragedy of abortion is that those 



who are being killed can nciihcr 
represent themselves before a 
court of law nor defend them- 
selves from sure death." (A crimi- 
nal docs appear before a judge in 
many trials before he is sentenced 
to a death penalty.) 

Killing an innocent unborn 
child is obviously different lhan a 
court of law sentencing someone 
to be executed because of his 
actions. 

You asked how someone who 
is pro-life can also be for capital 
punishment. Let mc explain why I 
am for capiial punishment. 

My standards and values come 
from what my Lord says in the 
Bible. When the court of law 
chooses to execute a murderer, 
they arc protecting society from 
evil men a Timothy 1:9-11). 

God upholds law and order as 
authorities over us (Romans 13), 
For those of us who are 
Chrisuans. we arc to rum ihc other 
check and be forgiving in our per- 
sonal relationships, but never to 
the detriment of what is lawful. 
We need to uphold the law and 



a righteous standard. 
In order to have a just and 
orderly court system, there must 
be consequences for crimes com- 
mitted in society. Now. the Lord 
mentions three times in the 
Scripture that you should take "an 
eye for an eye, and a tooth for a 
tooth." It is vital to note ihat all 
three limes it is regarding a civil 

That means ii docs not give us 
the right to personal revenge, yet 
that is how our human heart wants 
to interpret it: "Well, if he poked 
your eye out, go poke his eye 
oui." It applies to civil matters 
only. 

It simply means that the pun- 
ishment should equal the crime. 
The first time "eye for eye" is 
mentioned in Ihc Bible is in 
Exodus 21, and all of that chapter 
should be read carefully for ihc 
context, bui verses 23-25 specifi- 
cally say, "But if there is serious 
injury, you are to take life for life, 
eye for eye ... wound Tor wound." 

God's intern is for protecting 
good from evil in just (civil) 



recourse. The second place "eye 
for eye" is mentioned is in 
Leviticus 24; verses 17-24 slate 
thai die punishment should equal 
the crime: ".,. eye for eye, tooih 
for tooth. As he has injured Ihc 
other, so he is lo be injured. 
Whoever kills an animal (some- 
one else's property) must make 
restitution, but whoever kills a 
man must be put to death." 

There has to be consequence 
For crime. Finally, Deuteronomy 
19:11-13 siatcs that just punish- 
ment must be sought for society to 
be preserved, and that the court is 
not the place for pity. It is for jus- 
tice to be upheld. 

It is just for a man lo receive the 
consequence of his own decisions 
and actions; however, I see no jus- 
tice in allowing an innocent 
unborn baby to be mutilated by a 
doctor because it is convenient for 
someone.

Prevention is solution 



To the Editor: 

Yes, I am writing yet another 
letter addressing the abortion 
issue. Bui no, I will not try lo 
persuade you ihat women have a 
right to control their own lives. 

We've dcbaicd enough 
already and ihc argument has 
taken on a life of its own. 
Ultimately, neither ihc women 
nor their unborn children will 
win, but ralher the vicior will be 
group with the mosi deafening 
argument. 

Meanwhile we ignore the only 
acceptable solution, namely pre- 
vention. This is prevention 
beyond condoms and the pill, 
prevention thai insures a decent 
standard of living for everyone. 

We must all work towards 
guaranteeing every newborn a 
home where he is loved, fed and 
educated. Before a woman can 
choose lo be a mother she herself 
must live in such a home and 
know that she can afford the 
same for her children. Anything 



less constitutes child abuse. 

Do we realize what we have 
gollcn ourselves into? One in 
four children in the United Slates 
lives in poverty. How thankful 
arc they for their lives of hunger, 
cold and above all fear? Will they 
as adults overcome poverty and 
lead productive lives? I doubt it. 
Can we still afford lo point fin- 
gers in all directions telling other 
people how they must live, with- 
out truly making the Right Way a 
viable, feasible reality, nol to 
mention an appealing option? 

Blanket morals and ideals 
cannot be laid upon everyone 
with equal and positive results. 
We must be flexible and adapt lo 
our future or else our future (and 
all those unwanted children) will 
shape us against our will. The 
forced birth of children we arc 
not prepared for is a nightmare 
we might want to avoid.

Choice is ours alone 



To the Editor, 

The world has indeed become a 
complicated place. There are holes 
in ihc ozone, we can't tell by look- 
ing if our car is American or 
Japanese, and there arc people 
who try to make the people of the 
world think pro-choice and pro- 
abortion arc one in Ihc same. 

It is no! so. 

There arc valid grounds to 
siand on when you wish lo argue 
abortion. On the one side we can 
speak of "The sanctity of life," 
"The right to life," "God's will," 
"Cherishing the life of every indi- 
vidual human," "Life begins ai 
conception," "Who gives us the 
righl to play God?" You have 
heard these statements and many 

On the other side we can know 
that a human male will produce 
about a trillion sperm cells, all but 
two to four of which will perish, a 
human female produces perhaps 
100,000 ova of which 400 fully 
mature and fertilizable egg cells 



will perish fruitlessly. Anywhere 
from 30-50 percent of all embryos 
implanted in the human uterus are 
normally and spontaneously abort- 
ed. Mother nature seems to have a 
different scale by which to judge 
the "Sanctity of life." Can it be 
said acorns arc oak trees? A newly 
implanted clump of cells is no 
more a person than an acorn is an 
oak tree. 

Wiih so many diverse and truly 
good people agonizing over such a 
difficult question as abortion, il 
seems only the pro-choice stance 
serves lo quiet die waters. We all 
have our cross to bear. We live in 
difficult times. We arc trying to do 
our best. We arc responsible for 
our actions. We must each make 
such a serious and personal choice 
within our own understanding and 
faith and live with Ihc conse- 
quences of thai choice. That is ihc 
beauty and responsibility of living 
in a free society.

Flesh-eaters beware, vegetarianism way of the future 



By Chad Hesting 
Managing Editor 

Not too long back, I was leaf- 
ing through a humor magazine. 
On the page after the "Spy vs. 
Spy" cartoons, I happened upon 
a pair of lists, headlined 
"Politically Correct" and "Not 
Politically Correct." 

On the politically correct list, 
sandwiched between Ralph 
Nader and compost heaps was 
vegetarianism. 

"Hot Dog!" I exclaimed, 
"that's me." I started the veg- 
gie life about a year ago. Damn 
proud of it, too. 

If you've been going around 
thinking that vegetarians were a 
bunch of black-clad bohos and 
old hippie throwbacks, 
well. ..you 're right. The vegetar- 
ian lifestyle has its advantages, 
though, and you should think 
seriously about adopting it. 

I'm here to educate you. I'll 
address some widely asked 
questions about vegetarianism. 
Perhaps you'll come away with 
more respect for our rice-cake- 
chomping friends than you 
started with. 

Let's use that Q-and-A style 
that the Journal -Gazette staff 
passes off as editorials when 
they're feeling too lazy to write 
... shall we? 

Q: Does vegetarianism mean 
simply shunning meat? 

A: Nope. Vegetarianism means 
you have to leave all our four- 
footed buddies alone. Leather 
shoes? Forget 'em â€” nothing but 
vinyl from now on. Mary Kay 
Cosmetics? No more. They test 
on animals. Betting a fiver on 
Fido at the dog track this week- 
end? Use it to spring a pooch 



out of the pound instead. 

There's another breed of vege- 
tarian called a vegan, who 
won't even touch milk or eggs. 

That slack-jawed mushwit 
that's in your comp class is sim- 
ply called a veg. He reached his 
state of zen-like dumbness by 
consuming only Stroh's barley 
sodas. Technically, you could 
call that 




A: Money. A head of lettuce is 
always cheaper than a pound of 
ground chuck. Green in your 
mouth, green in your pocket. 
Get it? 

Q: Maybe rephrasing is in 
order. Why should I become a 
vegetarian? 

A: Oh. It cuts fat and choles- 
terol levels way down, for one. 
You won't be rolling the dice on 
whatever steroids Fanner Jones 
shot his livestock full of. Also, 
your new, paler skin tone means 
that beautiful gray suit will 
finally look right on you. 

Some environmentalists will 
try to sell you some cockeyed 
reasons for eating veggie. Like 
the grain used to feed a steer for 
one day will feed New Haven 
for a month. Or that our diges- 
tive systems aren't meant to 



handle anything heavier than, 
say, okra. Or that Dave 
"Wendy" Thomas' cattle are 
eating the Amazonian rain 
forest 

Forget them, choices should be 
personal. This is the United 
States, and the consumer rules. 
Remember what Warhol said: 
Shopping is more American 
than thinking. 

Q: Exactly what is tofu? 

A: Good question. I've never 
figured it out, myself. 

Q: Do I have to eat tofu if 
I'm vegetarian? 

A: Absolutely not. Nobody 
should eat that mushy shit. 

Q: Won't I lose a lot of pro- 
tein from my diet if I stop eat- 
ing meat? 

A: Not if you eat right. 
Problem is, I don't know any 
vegetarians who know exactly 
how to eat right. 

I mean, I've been hearing for 
years about some mythical com- 
bination of red beans and brown 
rice, or fava beans and brown 
rice, or eggs and pinto beans, 
maybe that creates a "perfect 
protein" found in red meat. That 
"perfect protein" is the holy 
grail for veggies, but damned if 
anyone knows exactly why. 

Except Irvin. Irvin is a veggie 
friend of mine who says that 
perfect protein exists in massive 
quantities in dried blue-green 
algae. 

So Irvin does his grocery 
shopping from the Germ-O- 
Rama Biological Supply Co. of 
Otter Falls, Michigan. The algae 
comes from them in what looks 
like a pill bottle, and Irvin eats 
it by the spoonful. 

Turns his teeth green. It's not a

pretty sight. 

Q: How do I spot a vegetari- 
an in a crowd? 

A: Look for a few distinguish- 
ing characteristics. Birkenstock 
sandals is a good one. A neck- 
lace with a crystal in it is anoth- 
er. (I have a suspicion that those 
crystals are actually rock salt, 
but I fear being locked up for a 
pervert if I try lo lick one.) A 
PETA button is a good tip-off, 
but a button that reads "OVER 
80 BILLION SLAUGH- 
TERED" is a sure thing. 

Q: What is anthropomor- 
phism? 

A: Now we're getting some- 
where. Anthropomorphism 
means assigning human charac- 
teristics to something that is not. 
Philosophical vegetarians suffer 
from it. 

Let's cut to the chase, shall 
we? Anthropomorphism lets us 
think that droopy-eared basset 
hounds are sad creatures, lets us 
laugh at Bugs Bunny, and 
makes philosophical vegetarians 
think cattle in the slaughter- 
house are squealing in pain. 

Q: Is it easy to find vege- 
tarian menu options in 
restaurants? 

A: Sometimes it is. The smell 
from Ernie's Steak House can 
shake one's faith to the core. 

Q: Isn't vegetarian life hard? 

A: Only vegetarians know the 
joy of finally locating preserva- 
tive-free bagels, only to experi- 
ence the pain of finding them 
molded over, 24 hours after you 
got them home. It can be a hard 
yoke to bear. 

Q: Wait a minute. You're 
faking all this. Didn't I see 
you in the Fort last week, eat- 



ing a cheeseburger? 

A: Why'd you have to bring 
that up? Next question. 

Q: 'Fessup! 

A: Alright, that was me. I was 
vegetarian, but I kinda fell off 
the wagon. 

It's almost impossible to be a 
busy student and cook veggie 
meals for yourself. If you don't 
cook for yourself, that means 
someone cooks for you. Most 



likely, that someone's gonna be 
Ronald McDonald, Dave 
"Wendy" Thomas, or that clown 
that plays the 50 m.p.h. piano 
on Taco Bell commercials. 
I plan to climb back on that 
wagon during the summer, 
though. My family holds a hog 
roast that doubles as a dull fam- 
ily reunion every summer. 

Vegetarianism is the best 
dodge I could think of.

Mega City Four cuts US debut; 
singles monotonous, yet unique 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Features Editor 

Danny and Gerry were away at 
school logciher. Wiz was Danny's 
brother. Chris used to go watch their 
band, which folded in 1986. The four 
formed a band called Mega City Four 
in 1987. 

In their first year MC4 played only 
15 gigs, but continued to play togeth- 
er despite their dismal beginning. 

In 1989 MC4 signed a record con- 
tract and released their debut album, 
"Tranzophobia" in Europe. Their 
success began to build, and they were 
booked for over 200 gigs. Later the 
same year MC4 look to the road to 
played with the Wonder Stuff. 

By 1990 MC4 released their second 
album, "Who Cares Wins," and 
began to tour again. This time MC4 
was booked to lour with The Cramps, 
the Lemonheads and Ned's Atomic 
Dustbin. The band even earned a 
spot at Reading Festival. 

More than 400 gigs later, MC4 
signed with an American label, Big 
Life Records, and have just released 



their U.S. debut "Scbastopol Road." 
MC4's first single, "Stop," was 
released last month, but has yet to 
gain radio air play. 

For their U.S. debut. "Scbastopol 
Road" offers safely selected cuts 
reminiscent of their origins. The 
music mimics sounds of the early 
British invasion of the 60s while 
combining techniques similar to the 
early 80s. Prevalent guitar sounds 
and a driving tempo characterize 
MC4's style. 

"Scbastopol Road" features 12 cuts. 
Although (he music docs become 
monotonous and repetitive, several 
cuts do stand out. "Callous," 
"Clown." "What's Up" and "Vague" 
arc characterized by unique drum pat- 
terns. The songs contain cool, up- 
beat rhythms, which arc different 
from the same sounds of the other 
songs. 

MC4's strongest asset is their gui- 
tar. "Ticket Collector" opens with 
short guitar bursts and "Scared of 
Cats" is laced with adventurous string 
sounds. "Anne Bancroft" takes on a 



different pace and is more acoustic 
than other tunes. 

Lyrically, the songs arc character- 
ized by themes of selfishness, using 
people, misunderstood love and 
accepting people for who they are. 
"Stop" stresses that everyone take his 
time to pay attention to details, which 
is a suitable topic for their U.S. debut 
single. 

MC4's music is basically main- 
stream alternative, which will appeal 
to a large audience. Although MC4 
docs have some good music on 
"Scbastopol Road," they will have to 
deviate from mainstream material to 
increase their popularity. With the 
numbers of up-and-coming music 
hopefuls, MC4 will have to make an 
effort to be different, instead of 
sounding like everyone else. 
However, with the powerful guitars 
and off-beat drums of some songs, 
MC4 has potential. 

MC4 is scheduled to tour the United 
States this summer.

Women's Softball squad gains momentum 
in conference after slow start in Florida 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW women's sofiball squad 
began the 1992 season with five wins 
and six losses in their Spring Break 
trip to Pcnsacola, Fla. 

The extended road trip has proved 
valuable to the 'Dons as they have 
jumped to a 5-3 record in Great Lakes 
Valley conference play. 

Against Kentucky State, IPFW won 
18-3 and 25-1 in the double header 
that kicked off conference play for the 
'Dons. Kcrric Quickcry and Mindc 
Raney both picked up a win in their 
pitching records. 

Head coach, Dale Van Houten, is 
pleased with the pitching staff so far 
this season. Sophomore Angic 
Quickcry, sister to freshman Kerric, 
have pitched the bulk of IPFW's 
innings this season. "Angie and Kcni 
are pitching real well," Van Houten 
said. 

Coming off the double header win at 
Kentucky State, IPFW traveled to 
Bcllarminc and split the games, 
boosting their record to 3-1 in the 
GLVC. 

Sixteen games into the season, IPFW 
finally opened home play with a 
double header against GLVC rival Sl 
Joscph's. IPFW won the first game 2- 
1 behind Angic Quickery's pitching, 
and Kcrric Quickcry pitched the 



second for IPFW in the 12-2 victory. 

Van Houten attributed the strong 
start in the GLVC to the experience 
and the athleticism of the players. "We 
have all players back from last year 
except one. and the girls are in good 
condition," said Van Houten. Five 
members of the team were also on the 
baseball team, including All- American 
Lisa Miller. 

Van Houten, in his sixth year as 
coach, has Jennifer Martin reluming 
who, as a sophomore, last season led 
the conference in hitting. "She is an 
experienced catcher, loo," Van Houten 
added. 

"Our hitting is pretty good this 
season, but our hits arc not timely," 
Van Houten said. This was evident in 
Sunday's double header against Lewis 
who won the conference last year. 
IPFW dropped both games by a 0-4 
and 1-4 scores. 

The losses gave IPFW a 5-3 record 
in conference play, which keeps Van 
Houten and the 'Dons on track to the 
goals. "We arc shooting for the top 
four places in the conference. That 
will allow us to play in ihc conference

Volleydons break school record with 24 wins 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

The Volleydons set a school record 
with 24 wins in a season, as they beat 
both No. 12 Pcnn Stale and No. 13 
George Mason this past weekend. 

Both wins came at the Volleycard 
Classic at Ball State University. 

In the first match against Penn State 
on Friday, the Volleydons needed four 
games to inch closer lo the record. On 
Saturday, however, IPFW wasted no 
time as they handed George Mason 



15-8. 15-8. and 15-12. 

IPFW has now won 14 of the last 16 
matches it has played. 

One of the most crucial matches 
IPFW will play this season is Saturday 
against Ball State (3-1) at home. The 
Volleydons are 5-0 in the Midwest 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association, 
and a win would mark the third 
consecutive MIVA regular season 
title. 

With the conference title comes the 
top seed in the MIVA conference 



nt to be held at Ohio State 
April 17 and 18. The top seed would 
mean a first round matchup with 
Wisconsin -Milwaukee, who has never 
beaten IPFW. 

The conference tournament winner is 
then seeded into the NCAA 
tournament for national champion.
