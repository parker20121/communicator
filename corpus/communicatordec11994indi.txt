Tax plans 
may reduce 
education 
funding 

By Angle Smith 
Staff Writer 

The American Association 
of University Professors 
(AAUP) anticipates hard limes 
for higher education in the 
wake of the GOP sweep of 
both houses of Congress and a 
majority of governorships. 

The AAUP President James 
E. Perlcy voiced concerns that 
the 104th Congress will not 
maintain sufficient federal 
investment in higher education. 

Perlcy, a professor of biolo- 
gy at the College of Wooster in 
Ohio, listed other areas, such as 
student aid funding, arts and 
humanities, and scientific 
research that faculty members 
fear may suffer in the hands of 
a leadership committed to cut- 
ting federal spending. 

The "Contract With 
America" contains several pro- 
visions that will have an 
adverse impact on higher edu- 
cation, AAUP believes. 
Specifically, if the in-school 
interest subsidy provision of 
the Contract is enacted, stu- 
dents would have to start pay- 
ing interest on their loans while 
still in school. 

The current practice, enact- 
ed in 1958, allows students a 
six-month grace period after 
they leave school. For a stu- 
dent in a four-year college who 
borrows the maximum for four 
years, eliminating the subsidy 
will add over S3. 500 to the 
amount he or she borrows 
(517,000), bringing the total to 
over $20,500 - a 20 percent 
increase. 

If the student goes on to 
graduate or professional 
school, the burden becomes 
higher, adding almost S13,000 
to an already-staggering 
S42,000-plus total. 

The contract also recom- 
mends elimination of those 
campus-based student aid pro- 
grams which are awarded to 
the most financially needy stu- 
dents. At the same time, it pro- 
poses reducing support for 
international education and cul- 
tural exchanges. 

Enactment of a balanced 
budget amendment, as called 
for in the Contract, will almost 
certainly mean reduced spend- 
ing for higher education, for 
arts and humanities, and for 
high-performance com- 
puting. Reimbursement rates 
for indirect costs for research 
projects will be slashed. 

Newly elected Republicans 
proposed cutting taxes in their 
campaigns; President Clinton 
has already indicated his will- 
ingness to consider cuts. 
Although it is too soon to know 
which programs will be 
reduced or eliminated, higher 
education, the arts, science and 
other programs that are of 
interest to professors will 
almost certainly have to lake 
hits. 

The AAUP is the national 
organization thai represents 
college and university faculty 
members exclusively. The 
AAUP is dedicated to defend- 
ing the principles of academic 
freedom and tenure and to 
establish sound academic stan- 
dards to ensure due process. 
The Association represents 
more ihan 43.000 faculty mem- 
bers ai colleges and universi- 
ties throughout the country.

discuss child care 



IPFW students to vote 
on technology fee 



By Nol T. Beckley 
Staff Writer 

In an unprecedented referendum, 
IPSGA will let the students decide 
whether they would pay a technolo- 
gy fee for installing Internet. 

Although IPFW is a state-funded 
university, no state money will be 
used for the Internet projecL 

IPSGA President Mark King, 
said, "The state doesn't consider 
Internet a necessity." 

This week. King, with the unani- 
mous support of the IPSGA, will 
send out pamphlets informing the 
students of the benefits of Internet. 

Four open forums discussing the 
educational aspects of Internet will 
be held the week before finals. 
Student Government invited Frank 



Borelli, vice chancellor of student 
affairs and Marian Zimmerman, 
dean of students of participate in 
these forums explained King. 

Also invited was the IPFW 
Computer Data Processing 
DepartmenL 

Internet has been the primary 
goal for the current administration 
under King. "Internet and other on- 
line services are the future of edu- 
cation, in my opinion." 

The referendum included a pro- 
vision for representation by the stu- 
dent body "on the board... involved 
in the expenditure of funds derived 
from the technology fee." 

Richardson said, "Information 
rules the world and we are taking 
steps to see the future is accounted 
for." 



The technology fee will costs S3 
per credit hour and will raise 
$600,000. 

Indiana University-Bloomington 
charges a technology fee of $100 
per semester for underclassmen and 
S32 per semester for seniors, 
according to the Indiana University 
Bursar's Office. 

Ball State University has no 
technology fee. The cost of support- 
ing Internet is included within the 
Student Activity fee of S300 per 
semester, according to Herb 
Stahlke, associate director of con- 
sulting services at Ball State. 

Stahlke said. "We [Ball State] 
cannot have special fees for tech- 
nology."

News Editor 

The Indiana-Purdue Student 
Government Association (IPSGA) 
held an open forum on Nov. 16 
with Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Frank Borelli. Comptroller 
Phil Davicb, Dean of Students 
Marian Zimmerman, and IPSGA 
Vice President Amy Steenman to 
discuss future provisions for child 
care. 

The location for the new child- 
care center will be at the single- 
level building on the southwest cor- 
ner of Crescent Avenue and 
Hobson Road. IPFW's child-care 
facilities were located there in the 
late 1970' s. 

The State Developmental Center 
has used it for the past several years 
by university agreement, according 
to Borelli. They will vacate the 
building by March of 1995, he said. 

He said the university will not 
remodel the building extensively 
because it is already in good shape. 
The building has enough room for 
the child-care center to expand as 
additional needs arise in the future. 
according to Davich. 

Borelli said IPFW is not interest- 
ed in conducting a joint child-care 
program wilh .mother school or cor- 
poration, Zimmerman said IPFW 
students' needs would be different 
from other students' needs and the 
facility isn't as close to other 
schools and employers as to IPFW. 
"That is our position. We don't 
want to be encumbered by the 
needs of another school," Borelli 
added. 

According to Borelli, student 
parents will be able lo drop their 
children off at the child-care center, 
and the center will be accessible. 

Borelli said the facility will be 
accessible to part-time faculty and 
staff, but students will receive top 



priority. He said full-time faculty 
will not have access to the child- 
care cenier. 

Davich said students may only 
keep their children at the center 
during class, to minimize service 
costs. 

He also said mosi students who 
need child care do not care if the 
center is licensed. Since Ihc center 
will not be licensed, it may super- 
vise a maximum of 45 children, 
according to Zimmerman. If 
demand exceeds capacity, 
Zimmerman said the center will be 
filled on a first come, first serve 
basis. 

The cenier is planned lo be open 
from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Mondays 
through Thursdays, and from 7 am. 
to 5 p.m. on Fridays. Zimmerman 
said the center's hours will depend 
on demand. Each child may remain 
at the center for a maximum of four 
hours. 

Zimmerman said she plans to 
hire a director who has the proper 
credentials lo manage the child-care 
cenier. The child-care task force 
would aid the decision-making 
process. Ii may also hire an assis- 
tant director. Students wtil form the 
rest of the staff. 

Zimmerman also said the stu- 
dents who work at the cenier may 
be work-study students. In addition 
(o a salary, work-study students 
receive financial aid for which the 
university is reimbursed by the fed- 
eral government. 

Zimmerman stressed that the 
unlicensed child-care cenier will 
still provide quality child care. "We 
really intend to run a quality opera- 
tion," she said. 

The IPFW School of Education 

will receive a new dean in the 

future. Questions about the early

New graduate degree 

Purdue approves M.S. in computer science 



By Melissa Young 
Staff Writer 

This monih, the Purdue Board 
of Trustees approved a Masters of 
Science program in applied com- 
puter science. 

On Nov. 18. ihe board 
answered the call of Northeastern 
Indiana employers and crealed a 
degree to train siudents and 
already-established business per- 



sonnel for higher efficiency In 
complex computer and informa- 
tion systems, as well as software 
engineering. 

"We did a survey of employ- 
ers... a very large number indicat- 
ed that they had a need for an 
advanced computer science 
degree." said James Silver, asso- 
ciate professor and chair of com- 
puter science. 

The program is geared toward 



those with a bachelor's degree in 
computer science, business, or 
mathematics; however, the pro- 
gram is available to other bache- 
lor degree-holders who have the 
proper prerequisites. 

Any student wishing to enter 
the program must have an 
advanced course in statistics or 
probability, a course in data struc- 
tures, a finite or discrete mathe- 
matics course, and knowledge of 



an advanced computer language, 
as well as meet Purdue's 
Graduate School criteria. 

The graduate students must 
complete 30 credit hours of 
course work. Each student will be 
able to plan his or her study plan 
with the approval of the graduate 
committee and the student's 
adviser. 

The major emphasis of the 
program is to allow the students 



to obtain "the ability to remain 
current as the technology changes 
daily," Silver said. 

According to Silver, the pro- 
gram will face the Indiana 
Commission for Higher 
Education for final approval dur- 
ing this winter. 

The program will require two 
new faculty members, and "we 
will also need additional clerical 
support," said Silver.

Theater 
professor 
named chair 

By Joel Kclky 
SUTT Writer 

Larry L. Life was named chair 
of ihe 1PFW Department of 
Theaier on Friday Nov. 11. He 
had been the acting chair since 
Mayl. 

Life has a long history of work 
and education in the iheater. First 
acquiring a Bachelor of Science 
degree in 1967, and then a Master 
of Arcs degree in 1969 at Ball 
Stale University, Life went on to 
work professionally in New York. 

Two years later. Life relumed 
to Indiana to leach at IPFW. In 
1973, one of Life's theater pro- 
ductions, Dames at Sea, was per- 
formed at The American College 
Theater Festival in Washington 
DC Life returned to the Festival 
in 1976 for his production of Hair. 

Life has directed several pro- 
ductions with the Philharmonic 
and has directed more than 90 
shows in Fort Wayne and all over 
the United States. 

Life received the Jack Ulmer 
Memorial Award in 1990 for 
addressing issues that concerned 
minorities, women, and people 
with disabilities, and was named 
Outstanding Artist and Educator. 

Among his olher achieve- 
ments, Life has served as guest 
director at several olher 
ties and institutes. 



Child care 



- from page 1 

childhood education program will 
be brought to the new dean of the 
school of education. 

According to Zimmerman, 
IPFW has had a child-care plan of 
some sort since the late I970's. 

IPFW students took their chil- 
dren to the child-care center at 
Parkview Memorial Hospital from 
September of 1991 to December of 
1992. Zimmerman said IPFW stu- 
dents and a few faculty members 
became the center's largest users, 
which was not planned. 

Borelli said IPFW lost about 
$100,000 over the 16-month period. 
IPSGA subsidized the program 
with the amount necessary to hire 
the child care director, which is 
about $27,000. 

Zimmerman said the quality at 
Parkview's child-care center was 
excellent, but the fees were high, 
and students couldn't afford it. 
Students can still use the center at 
Parkview, if (hey wish, she said. 

Borelli created a child-care task 
force in the fall of 1992. The task 
force consists of Davich, Kim 
McDon, Stcenman. Linda Johnson, 



Snippets 



and students Pearl Heath and Deb 
Deer. 

The task force advertised a sur- 
vey in The Communicator and set 
up locations for students to nil out a 
preliminary survey in the spring of 
1993. Zimmerman said the survey 
received loo little response to draw 
any conclusions from it 

The task force sent out another 
survey in the spring of 1994 to 
every IPFW student. Davich said 
the task force received about 500 
responses. Of the respondents, 205 
had children and the majority want- 
ed on-site child care. 

Zimmerman said the child-care 
center will be publicized in the 
coming months. It will be men- 
tioned at Student Orientation and 
Registration, and possibly an adver- 
tisement will be placed in the fall 
1995 schedule. In addition, she 
said, "We will be announcing it at 
ASTRO (Adult Student Reentry 
and Orientation)." The Child care 
Referral Service would probably be 
in charge of the advertising, she 
said.

Letters to the Editor 



It's not a question 
of hair color 



To the editor: 

I am submitting this concerning 
the article titled "There is no solu- 
tion in this movie," written by 
Sbizz-Man. This will be the one 
and only time that I express my 
viewpoini, I am an African- 
American woman who is engaged 
to be married to a Caucasian. I am 
tired of individuals who do not 
know me trying to analyze wby I 
am in love with the MAN of my 
choice. Notice that 1 stressed 
MAN, not black man, white man or 
any other race. 

Shizz-Man, let me lell you 
something: I am a strong WOMAN 
because 1 know who I am and I 
know where I am going. My par- 
ents, both of whom have a racially 
mixed culture, as most of us do, 
raised me with love and under- 



standing. That is the same love that 
my husband and I will give to our 
children. 

All that 1 am trying to say is that 
this is my life, and 1 will do with it 
as I wish. My future husband and 1 
will raise strong children (not 
strong black or white children, just 
children). Besides, children do not 
distinguish between races.. .it takes 
an older individual to point out the 
differences to them. 

By the way, tbose who know me 
can see that my skin may be a little 
light, my hair is very curly, and my 
nose is not narrow. Amazingly, my 
significant other has curly hair, and 
bis nose is larger than mine. So 
Shizz-Man, as you can sec I have 
broken your expert moldl

IPFW Employee and Student 



Pedestrians have 
the right-of-way 



To the editor: 

IPFW is a great school and it 
has a great curriculum, but one 
drawback is that IPFW has no 
on-campus housing. Many stu- 
dents and parents would seri- 
ously consider IPFW as a uni- 
versity to attend if there were 
on-campus housing. 

One reason that there aren't 
as many students at IPFW is 



that the parents of high school 
seniors look for several things 
in their consideration of the 
school that their children attend. 
One of those things is if there is 
campus housing. Parents want 
to know that their children are 
safe after they leave home. 
IPFW can't offer on-campus 
housing to those who look for it 
as a prerequisite in a university 



to attend. 

Another reason that there 
should be housing for students 
is that students don't really like 
to have to find a job and an 
apartment just to attend school. 
There are many pressures on a 
freshman when starting at a 
new school. A job and rent add 
more pressures for them. IPFW 
offers good programs, but 



doesn't offer good alternatives 
for housing. 

The price for classes at IPFW 
is very competitive and the 
quality of the school is very 
good, but campus housing 
would just add another great 
component to this school. 

F Carrillo 



To the Editor: 

As a student at IPFW. I have 
recently noticed the disregard of 
pedestrian rights-of-ways by drivers 
on the campus. This past week, I 
have witnessed two incidents that 
greatly concern me. 

In the first incident, a driver had 
yielded to a student walking across 
the street. A second car passed the 
stopped car on the right side and 
nearly hit the student crossing the 
streeL 

In the second incident, a pedes- 
trian was forced back onto the curb 
when a driver refused to yield to 
him. 

Because of these two incidents, I 
believe every driver should make a 
conscious effort to obey a pedestri- 



an's right-of way. 

This concerns me for the simple 
fact of my personal safety. The 
crosswalks are painted on the roads 
for a reason. The pedestrian has the 
right-of-way, not the drivers. 
Drivers are supposed to yield when 
pedestrians are crossing the road. 

1 don't think this is a difficult 
thing to do. It does not lake much 
time After all, when you think 
about it, at one time or another we 
are all pedestrians. If every driver 
could be a little more conscious of 
the people crossing the roads to and 
from the parking lot, then no one 
will ever have to think twice about 
safety when exercising his or her 
right-of-way as a pedestrian.

Seen the vehicle vomit coagu- 
lated on the cement? Trampled 
through tbe oil and grease? 
Perchance slipping? Got chicle 
seeping into your insoles? Got 
your permit privileging you blue 
and henceforth situating you in 
lieu for a beeline toward tutelage? 
Got it dangling from the neck of 
your vehicle's rear-view mirror in 
case the police should peruse? 
Taken a gander at the asphalt as 
you navigate through the parked 
automobiles in either class A, B or 
free? Free? Free parking out yon- 
der past gymnasium on the far side 
of nowhere. Dubbed Green, I 
believe. You know, out yonder 
where tbe gypsy caravans park 
their circus at night and one can 
distinctly discern upon sneaking 
next to the gypsies' omnibuses, 
suctioning one's ear against the 
metallic exoskeleton like a 
Peeping Tom or an 007; ear suc- 
tioned as such one can audibly dis- 
cern wheezes as of a contortionist 
yawning or an acrobat snoring, 
both dreaming in the prime of their 
sleep, perhaps, although perhaps 
the gypsies are not dreaming. You 
must realize that by cloaking your- 
self with the persona of a Peeping 
Thomas, your thoughts and subse- 
quent clairvoyance can only stray 
so far and then you must acknowl- 
edge that any extension of thought 
is merely fantasy or figment on 
your pan. Even so, the hope still 
lingers that the sky is the limit with 
such fantastic speculations and just 
perhaps this once you will be bona 
fide in your fantastic scenarios. 



But unfortunately this time much 
to your dismay and dejection, all 
you bear are fragments of snore 
and yawn and you are unable to 
snowball snore and yawn into hal- 
lucination. Your nodes inform you 
that there is nothing exotic to be 
snowballed when it comes to the 
rhythmic somnolence of yawning 
or snoring. Dejected, you shrug 
and unsuck your ear realizing that 
all is sterile and sleepy with the 
gypsies tonight, and seeing so you 
are content with the fact that all 
you beard was the respiration of 
gypsies sleeping somnolently in 
their renovated double-deckers. 
This gypsy anecdote an aside sim- 
ply for a point. The point portrayed 
is in likeness of a parable insinuat- 
ing that gypsies know the knack 
and therefore park in freedom, 
whereas the rest of us ignoramuses 
fork over sixteen clams to park our 
participles on soiled cement and 
therefore we are aficionados is of 
academia and acquiscenters for the 
disenfranchisement of people who 
can't embroider their cars with six- 
teen clam parking stubs. State 
cement mottled with dysenteric 
blotches of car chyme. Not even 
tarnished with cedar chips to keep 
our stomachs calm. As such, envi- 
sion blue and contrast this to the 
cement out yonder in freedom, and 
you will discover that though it be 
old and splayed with fissures, it 
has much less oil on its surface per 
parking space. How is it, then that 
free parking is cleaner than paid 
parking? Perhaps money doesn't 
buy sanitary cement. Next year's 
price tag on parking? Probably 
umpteen SS.SS as opposed to S16 
and furthermore a flat price and an 



eradication of green freedom to 
thwart any thrifty mavericks who 
would otherwise say the hell with 
umpteen S5SS. Ubiquitous expanse 
of dubbed blue everywhere. Think 
about it. Perhaps we can boycott 
blue and patronize green before the 
price lag inflates and green is 
gone. Who knows, perhaps you 
can wear that spare lire off your 
torso with ihe extra mileage you 
put on by being vegetarian. Green, 
1 mean. Trot the European walk, or 
whatever trot suits your contour 
and comportment. Wobble, if nec- 
essary. Then perhaps green will 
spill over into the green-going- 
grey grass and the parameters of 
freedom will be challenged and an 
addition of green parking will be 
allotted or a former portion of blue 
parking will be converted into 
green. And even better yet envi- 
sion, if you dare, a green parking 
garage! A stack of pancakes 
absolutely free of charge, compli- 
ments of the state. Such fantasy 
and flight of imagination! Imagine 
all the happy Peeping Toms and 
007s playing hide amongst the 
pancakes. What a gas they will 
have! I've fatigued with this paltry 
prophesy so take it for its 
inevitability and verisimilitude and 
be forewarned lhai if you don't 
boycou blue in favor of green then 
the price will escalate and no ceil- 
ing will be implemented on tbe 
price of parking permits. 
Mavericks and gypsies alike will 
be forced into complacence and 
individuality will become a monot- 
onous blue.

Professor Knox is nowhere to be found 



To the editor; 

WHERE IS PROFESSOR 
KNOX77? 

This question may sound much 
like the title of the uniquely popular 
game where we find ourselves fever- 
ishly searching for the ever-elusive 
Carmen San Diego; however. I will 
comment on only two significant sim- 
ilarities between them 1) In both 
cases, we are searching for an 
assertive, resourceful and intelligent 
female role model 2) Both females 
are exiremely popular. The most 
noted differences between the two; 
Carmen (an international thief) is 
likely to steal just about anything, 
whereas Ms. Knox, will steal your 
undivided attention (and quite possi- 
bly your ethically directed heart). 

What I want to know is this: 
WHY. WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH 



THE SCHEDULE BOOK TO HELP 
A YOUNG FRIEND EVALUATE 
CHOICES FOR THE 1995 SPRING 
SEMESTER. CAN'T I FIND MS 
KNOX OR MANY OF THE 
DIVERSELY POPULAR CLASSES 
SHE IS QUALIFIED TO TEACH??? 
NOTE: I did see her listed as instruct- 
ing an Introduction to Political 
Science class. While I believe the his- 
torical accuracy and insight she CAN 
bring this class to be an important 
foundation for any student, I find this 
only placement of her talents as 
insultingly wasteful ag having 
Thoreau teach first graders how to 
write in cursive. 

1 am a recent graduate of IPFW 
(May 1994) and plan on attending 
Law School in the fall of 1995. Since 
I am no longer on campus you may 
wonder why I am so concerned about 
what is currently being taught at the 



undergraduate level. As an alumna of 
this university. I am quite concerned 
that the benefits that were offered to 
me remain in place, grow and 
improve for those that will follow 
after me. Second, when I tell you how 



off) of the knowledge and s 

of an instructor already employed 

with YOUR MONEY by IPFW. 

In Ms. Knox's classes I learned to 
emancipate my mind from paradigms 
I previously thought were chiseled in 



"In Ms. Knox's classes I

mind from paradigms I

I benefited on a personal level and as 
pari of (he greater group called "stu- 
dents" YOU DECIDE whether you 
are being unduly deprived (that's 
politically correct for being "ripped-

Support for athletics needed at IPFW 



To the editor, 

"IPFW wins men's attendance 
title for the 1994 season!" 
According lo a statistical atten- 
dance report released by the 
American Volleyball Coaches 
Association, the IPFW men's 
volleyball team averaged 2090 
fans at their 15 home matches. 
600 more fans than the number- 
two-ranked school in the list. 
While the attendance for men's 
volleyball has been very impres- 
sive, the attendance for all other 
athletic events has been very 
poor. 

I am a student at IPFW. I am 
also a member of the men's vol- 
leyball team here at IPFW. As a 



volleyball player, I have become 
familiar with many of the other 
athletic teams. 1 have gone lo 
several different games and have 
noticed something similar at all 
of them: no student support 

I know there are many excus- 
es that students use for not 
attending the games, and all of 
them can be justified; however, 
there are several reasons to 
include IPFW athletics in your 
social agenda. One of the rea- 
sons involves the activities fee 
that is included in every stu- 
dent's tuition. The activities fee 
is a payment that supports the 
athletic department at (he school. 
One aspeel that accompanies the 
activities fee is the fact that stu- 



dents arc admitted free to all ath- 
letic events with the presentation 
of their student identification. 
Another reason students should 
attend the sporting events at 
school is the teams here at IPFW 
need student support. The prima- 
ry support for athletics on a col- 
lege campus should be the stu- 
dent. 

In conclusion, 1 would like to 
introduce some of my ideas that 
might help increase the student 
attendance at athletic events at 
IPFW. I suggest that our student 
newspaper strengthen its cover- 
age and acknowledement of all 
the athletic teams. Also, the 
Student Activities Board could 
begin to make announcements of 



upcoming athletic events and 
create new events that would fur- 
ther involve students. These are 
my suggestions. I realize that 
they will not solve the problem 
entirely: but, they will provide a 
step in the right direction. So, I 
hope the administration, the fac- 
ulty, and especially the students 
at IPFW will consider the unique 
opportunity they have and begin 
to support their various 
Mastadon teams. 

Yours truly, 

Justin Luna

Gays, lesbians need protection in work place 



To The Editor, 

I noticed some letters and com- 
mentary in the Nov. 10, 1994 
Communicator on lesbians and 
gays. 1 would like lo make a cor- 
rection and a couple of comments. 
Paul Tupper refers lo Mayor 
Helmke's recent Executive Order. 
What the Mayor has done is 
attempt to protect gay, lesbian and 
heterosexual city employees from 
discrimination in the workplace 
by using the personnel policy. 
This is in line with such compa- 
nies as Lincoln Life and General 
Motors, which also use their per- 
sonnel policies 10 prohibit dis- 
crimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation. 

In addition, the Indiana Civil 
Rights Commission (ICRC) does 
plan to back a move to add sexual 



orientation and age to the stale 
Civil Rights Statute in this com- 
ing session of the slate legislature. 
The local Metropolitan Human 
Rights Commission has appointed 
a committee to study this entire 
issue. It will be chaired by 
Commissioner Karen Fowler- 
Williams, who is a former 
Director of the ICRC. The issue 
of sexual orientation may also be 
addressed by the slate legislature 
in the context of a hate crimes 
bill. 

Why are cities, stales and busi- 
nesses taking this step? Sexual 
conduct is normally prohibited at 
work, so why the need to protect 
employees on the basis of sexual 
orientation? It is because people 
are mscriminated against, hassled 
and harassed for no other reason 
than that someone THINKS that 



they are gay or lesbian. This rea- 
son alone is sufficient to try to 
protect people. 

Does any of this mean that we 
have to approve or disapprove of 
private consensual sex? Is it not 
possible that if we all had to put 
up our past or present sexual 
behaviors before a "board of cor- 
rect sex" that many people would 
maybe never get to have any sex 
again? Is sex really the issue any- 
way or is it the institution of the 
family and the mess that many 
straights have made of it with no 
help at all from homosexuals!! 
Are gays and lesbians the 
modem- day scapegoats for some- 
body else's problem (and maybe a 
fundraising strategy for bigots)? 

In addition, the Bible is not so 
clear on this subject as some peo- 
ple seem to think and Jesus said 



not one word about it. 
Furthermore, deer, cattle, birds, 
monkeys and a large number of 
other animals in nature have been 
caught in the act, too. Not natu- 
ral? Are we saying that nature is 
not natural? Furthermore, Eve and 
her partner are having tots of kids 
and Adam and Steve are, too. 
Guess what? Some of these kids 
turn out heterosexual and some of 
them do not Genetics classes are 
offered at IPFW, maybe Jason 
Vice should sign up. Behavior is 
always chosen but attractions just 
happen. Some people are never 
attracted to the opposite sex. This 
will never ruin the world and 
plenty of kids will continue to be 
bom. Chill out! 

Sincerely, 

Joyce A. Stevens, M.P.A. 79 



Commuter college needs 
to change its tune at IPFW 



To the editor: 

I am a student at IPFW, and 
every day I spend from two to 
two-and-a-half hours driving 
between home and school. I 
know there are many other stu- 
dents like me who also drive 
long distances to come to 
school. I believe that most stu- 
dents would agree with me when 
I say that IPFW would greatly 
improve with dorms. 

Although this would cost a 
large amount of money, I feel 
that it would pay for itself in a 
few years. Dorms would tremen- 
dously improve the almost non- 
existent social atmosphere on 
campus. This would definitely 
increase the appeal of IPFW to 



high school students who are the school could bring in enough 
choosing a college to attend At extra money to pay for the pro- 
the same time, it would most jecL 

"As with most students here, I am 
becoming very bored and discour- 
aged with the commuter-college life. 
Don't you think it's time for a little 
change for the better?" 



likely cut back on the rate of stu- 
dents transferring to another col- 
lege. Dorms would also make it 
easier for students to take more 
credit hours. With increased 
enrollment, an increase in credit 
hours, and room and board fees, 



Another beneficial factor to 
building dorms is the resolving 
of the parking problems. How 
often do you hear students who 
live on campus complain about 
being late because they can't 
find parking spaces? 



you agree with the aforementioned 
statement trust me — you NEED one 
of her classes before you end up own- 
ing a bridge over some swampland. 

As a student in three of her upper 
division classes, I had the benefit of 
being part of a collective and partici- 
patory method of instruction. You 
may know this as "Socratic" method. 
(Not necessarily a random compari- 
son when we consider what happened 
to that truth teacher). 

I also had the benefit of her years 
of education and vastly diverse expe- 
riences I believe it suffices to say 
that her curriculum viiac would fill 
this page. 

If you have never had the opportu- 
nity to take one of her classes person- 
ally, or to be a member of a class she 
has developed, you do not know what 
you are missing. It is like the old 
adage of the worm in the sauerkraut 



Lastly, it would save a lot of 
wear and tear on the people's 
cars, as well as save them gas 
money. Every week I put about 
four hundred miles on my car. 
just commuting to and from 
school. I find myself stopping at 
the gas station two to three times 
a week to fill up. After about 
nine months of this. $30-$40 a 
week on gas adds up to be a 
large sum of money. 

As with most students here, I 
am becoming very bored and 
discouraged with the commuter- 
college life. Don't you think it's 
time for a little change for the 
better?

I now ask YOU to ask YOUR-

Stop bashing; 
start voting 



To the editor: 

Being an IPFW student, I've 
noticed that many people on this 
campus always seem to find one 
person to speak negatively about 
and this year it seems to be Mark 
King, student body president. I 
think people have judged him to the 
point that whatever be does will not 
be good enough. These people will 
always find some kind of fault with 
his decision. Let me remind all of 
you that sometime in our life we've 
all made bad decisions. Please, 
don't get me wrong, I am not totally 
defending or excusing his mistakes, 
but I do feel everyone needs to be 
given a little slack sometime. To 
tell you the truth, I get tired of hear- 
ing everyone complain about what 
a terrible job Mark King is doing. 
Everyone seems to be directing all 
of their attention to bis mistakes 
instead of how we can solve the 
problems facing this campus. 
Fighting and arguing from both 
sides will not benefit anyone on this 
campus in any way. The whole pur- 
pose of a student government is to 
help the students, faculty and 
administrators work together 
through problems in a compromis- 
ing way. 

Let me remind everyone there is 



something each and every one of us 
can do and that is vote. I ask all of 
you one thing: Did you vote in the 
last election for student body presi- 
dent? Voting is the first thing we 
can to do to make a change in our 
student government. A good exam- 
ple of how voting can make a dif- 
ference was the recent national gov- 
ernment election. The people of the 
United States wanted lo change 
their government and that's exactly 
what they did. By regaining 
Congress, the people sent a mes- 
sage to Washington that they want- 
ed someone to do a job and to do it 
right. We, as students of IPFW. can 
do exactly (be same tbing. To 
begin, we must have a majority of 
the campus vote. This would send 
our message to the high and mighty 
people that we want change, but the 
change not only comes by voting. 
Everyone must be aware of the 
issues on campus and be willing to 
take action by voicing ideas in a 
constructive manner consistently 
throughout the year We can all 
work together — students, student 
body and administrators to make 
the system work. 

Sincerely. 
Megan Bannec 



Commentary 

Not a choice 



By Paul Tupper 

The far religious right would like 
everyone to believe that homosexu- 
ality is a choice that sinners make. If 
you have ever spoken with a homo- 
sexual, you would probably hear that 
this is not a choice. No one chooses 
to like rock music; no one chooses 
not lo like rap music. But, until now, 
there had been no proof thai homo- 
sexuality is biologically -based. 

In the Nov. 18. 1994 issue of The 
Journal-Gazelle, an article ran that 
proved homosexual and heterosexual 
men have significant differences in 
the brain. The difference is that in 
homosexual men, the isthmus is 13 
percent larger than in heterosexual 
men. This was uncovered by a learn 
of Canadian researchers. 

So what does this mean? 

It means thai, indeed, homosexu- 
als are born gay, just as Afro- 
Americans are bom black. There has 
been controversy dealing with the 
struggle in both communities. Many 
gays, including myself, feel dial our 
fighi for freedom parallels that of the 
black race. Some African-Americans 
are insulted by this, saying thai gays 
can hide their sexuality and not be 
discriminated against- 1 now ask, are 
we really free if we are hiding our 
sexuality, our true selves, from the 
bigoted? 

I also ask, would blacks hide their 
color if they had the opportunity? 
With thai said, it's obvious who ihe 



problem is. It's noi the African- 
Americans; they were bom black. 
and they cannot change thai. It's not 
die homosexuals; we were bom gay, 
and we cannot change that. So, it 
must be the white heterosexuals who 
are tbe problem. It is they who will 
not lei us progress. 

All people (I hope) believe thai 
blacks are equal to whites because 
they are as intelligent, as articulate 
and as talented as whites. And 
because color is not a choice. I am 
here lo tell all of you non-believers 
that we homosexuals are, in fact, as 
intelligent, as articulate and as tal- 
ented as any other orientation. We 
want freedoms you have: the right to 
marriage, the right to adopt and the 
right to freely express ourselves at 
any given moment. 

Now that we know it's not a 
choice homosexuals make, maybe 
homosexuality will be taken more 
seriously across the board. Maybe 
gays will be included in more stud- 
ies (like the ones you learn about in 
many of your classes). Maybe peo- 
ple will see thai there is more to us 
than our habits in the bedroom. 
Maybe there will be a sitcom with an 
entire cast of gays playing gay roles. 

Who knows what the future will 
bold? I believe that the only way is 
up, and we are gaining. Life is get- 
ting better for lie open homosexual. 
This study is a major step for us.

By S. Branl Kclky 
News Editor 

The IPFW women'* basketball

Grand Valley Stale University 
(GVSU) tournament over the week- 
end of Nov. 18 and 19, then relumed

Porch, 
Teagarden 
named 
all-GLVC 



By S. Brant Kelley 
News Editor 

Heather Teagarden and Dottle 
Porch of IPFW's women's volley- 
ball team were named to the 1994 
All-Great Lakes Valley Conference 
(GLVC) learn. 

Freshman Andi Rcichart was 
selected for the Division II all- 
regional team, but ironically, was 
not nominated for on all -con fere nee 
spot by GLVC coaches. IPFW vol- 
leyball coach Tim Hcffron said she 
didn't stand out to the conference's 
coaches. 

Teagarden, a junior, was named 
to the all-GLVC team for the sec- 
ond straight year. She was among 
the conference's leaders in kills and 
digs per game and in hitting per- 
centage. 

Porch, a freshman, averaged 
1 .24 blocks per game. Her 252 kills 
for the season ranked third on the 
team. 

Teagarden graduated from 
Snider High School, where she 
helped win the Indiana slate high 
school volleyball championship in 
1991. She is currently third on 
IPFW's all-time kill list, with 1 180. 

IPFW volleyball coach Tim 
Hcffron said Teagarden, a second- 
time selection, is a very consistent 
player. She also matured into one 
of the team's leaders. 

Porch, from Richmond, had 104 
block assists to rank in IPFW's top- 
10 career list. She is an academic 
sophomore and did not play during 
her freshman year. 

Heffron said Porch can jump to 
touch 10 feel, one inch. "1 think she 
could be one of those all-American 
types," be said. 

Teagarden, Porch and Rcichart 
led IPFW to a season mark of 19- 
16 and the GLVC tournament 
championship.

In search of... the best Blow Pop , The Communicator 



Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

This week I am delving into 
the world of Blow-Pops. Yes, my 
friends, Blow-Pops. I have decid- 
ed to, once and for all. find out 
which flavor is the best. The cri- 
teria for this investigation are 
quite simple. First, the Blow-Pop 
must have a lot of flavor. The 
aflerta-ste must also be sweet and 
fulfilling. And, of course, the 
reward (the gum), after sucking 
the Blow-Pop until you are fin- 
ished, must have a lasting flavor. 

The rating system for the 
Blow-Pop investigation is based 
on licks. One lick means that the 
Blow-Pop makers should go back 
and rethink how to improve the 
flavor. Two licks is that the 
Blow-Pop is .ill right, but could 
use a little improvement. Three 
licks is good, but there was just 
one little thing missing. Four 
licks is unbelievably delicious 
and calls for an encore. 

WATERMELON: 
3 1/2 LICKS 
My first taste was mouthwa- 
tering and amazing. I loved the 
watermelon from the start. The 
flavor was apparent and it wasn't 
strong, but the fruitiness of the 
sucker was good. The gum at the 
end of the sucker was all right. It 
got old and hard really fast. So 
out of a possible four licks, the 
watermelon flavor ranked 3 1/2 
licks. 

STRAWBERRY; 

4 LICKS 

After experiencing wonderful 

flavor with the watermelon 



Blow-Pop, I was in for an even 
better experience with the straw- 
berry flavor. The flavor of the 
sucker was perfect. The sucker 
itself lasted a little longer and the 
aftertaste was pure heaven. The 

gum was, again, not that great, 
but, hey. with that great taste, 
who cares! Out of a possible four 



licks, the strawberry flavor 
received all four licks for perfec- 
tion. 

SOUR APPLE: 
1LICK 
This flavor was such a let- 
down compared to the watermel- 
on and strawberry flavors, that I 
do not even want to have to dis- 




Travis Stahl tries a Blow-Pop on Monday.

cuss this flavor. But I will be fair. 
I felt the taste was too sour and 
because of this 1 could hardly fin- 
ish the sucker. But, after a while, 
when I finally completed it, I 
found the aftertaste to be just as 
bad as the sucker itself. And the 
gum was just about the same as 
all the others, bland and hard. 
This sucker only received one 
lick, and that is being nice! 

GRAPE: 
I LICK 
The next-to-last flavor in this 
investigation is grape. And it is 
just as well, because my tongue 
cannot lake any more! This fla- 
vor is bland and had no taste. At 
least the sour apple had some sort 
of taste. This grape thing was 
tasteless. And because of this 
tastelessness, there was basically 
no aftertaste. And I couldn't tell 
you what the gum was like 
because I couldn't even finish the 
sucker to gel to it. So, on the 
basis of the tasle of the sucker 
itself, I gave this Blow-Pop one 
lick. 

CHERRY: 
5 LICKS 
The final flavor in question is 
cherry. I personally love cherries 
and looked forward to tasting this 
one. If I thought that strawberry 
and watermelon were awesome, 
boy, I had no idea what was in 
store for me. The taste was utter- 
ly amazing; those Blow-Pop peo- 
ple really know suckers. 
Everything about this sucker just 
said perfection all over it. So out 
of a possible four licks, this fla- 
vor received 5 because it is per- 
fect.
