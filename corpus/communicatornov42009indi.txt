Fund Merger 

Student Government fuse Travel and 
Discretionary Funds 



By Peter Schnellenberger 



On Ocl. 21, The Communicatot 
reponeil ihat Ihe IPSGA student senate 
had allocated half of the funds that 
ihcy distribute to various Miidcnis and 
c&lt;tmpus organizations for the entire 
year- $in'l,362 out of S210,000. As of 
Nov. 2. Ihai number had dropped again 

To help even out Ihe remaining 
funds and allow for more money to be 
spcnl on campus, KodyTinnel, Student 
llody Vice President of Legislation, 
pul forth a bill that would merge ihe 
lliscrctionary funds- money used to 
host student events -- and Travel funds 

■ ■ money used to send students on trips 

■ - Info one. The proposal would not 
only affect the remainder of this school 
year, but for subsequent years to come 
unless Senate decides to divide the 
funds again or create an entirely new 
system. 

Whenever Senate dispenses funds 
to recipients, the money comes from a 
single reservoir. The arbitrary division 
beiwecn travel and discretionary funds 
was an internal device scl up by (he 
Senate. "The two funds were set up as 



guidelines for hnw much Senate should 
spend on (ravel and discretionary'. 
From an administialivc standpoint 
IPFW doesn't care (hat we have (wo 
separ3(e funds." saidTinnel, 

Now (hat the funds have been 
united, in (he future there can be 
more money spent on activities to 
serve the campus, as a whole, instead 
being spent (o send small groups and 
individuals on (rips, Tmncl said. "If 
in any given year Senate decides thai 
they feel events on campus are more 
worthwhile, they can spend money on 
those sor(5 oF cven(s ins(e3d of travel, 
or vice versa." 

Deangelo LaVette, Head of (he 
Legisladve Committee, fell thai 
the merger wasn't needed because 
having Ihe two funds allowed for 
"travel to compete againsi iravel and 
discretionary to compete against 
discretionary." Now that the division 
has been removed, Iravel will have to 
compete against discrelionary. 

From now on, students interested 
in traveling to conferences will have 
lo think about how (heir (rip will 
benetir the campus community and 
organizations will have to find the most 
bang for their buck, if ihcy want to have 
IPSGA foot the bill.

Andrew Sullivan uses his columns, online blog, and frequent 
television appearances to question the present course of 
conservatism in America, arguing for the revival of conservative 
traditions for the Republican Party, not religious ideology. 

As senior editor and blogger at The Atlantic and as a columnist 
for the Sunday Times of London, Sullivan is one of the most 
provocative political and social commentators today. His blog, 
7/ie Daily Dish, is found on The Atlantic.com, where his incisive

"Dear Apple, Your Mouse 
Sucks" corrections 



By Alexander Devinney-Stoner 

6tm0 1 0ilud*nll-&gt;phii tin 



This lelicr is in response lo lasi 
weeks article eniiifed "Dear Apple Your 
Mouse Sucks.' IhavebeenaMacowner 
for almosi a year now. and was shacked 
at die anicle Tor several reasons. 

Reason I: Malf of (he argument 
was thai It only has one button. 
That 'Apple eventually 
gave ihe Mighty Mouse 
secondary button m 

runclionality." This , " 

argument that took 
up hair Ihe article is 
outdated since the 
Mighty Mouse was 
released back in 2005. 
Why exactly are we 
having complainis 
about an Issue thai 
was solved over Tour 
years ago? Going 
further Into what I 
believe was being said 
in Ihe article was that, 
even ihough il could 
be a two button mouse 
it still only has one shell. 
Really? It is ton hard to press 
the right side of the shell? Give 
me a break. 

Kcason 2: In the editorial the author 
states, 'Do not get me wrong ii is a 
gical mouse crgonomically,' then 
liHct the author criticizes the mouse 
by slating, "The last problem pertains 
to the shape of the Apple mouse, and 



Letter to the Editor 

i.s by far my biggest concern." However, 
I disagree with this contradiction. I 
have a surgically repaired wrist and I 
have more problems with other mice 
based on their height and design. My 
Mac mouse is great and I never have a 
problem, because of its low prohle and 
smaller shape. 

Reason 3: The 360 degree scroU 

bail, which was also added 

back in 2005. is small but 

still does its job just fine. 

I do not think you have 

' to have a giant wheel 

in the middle of your 

mouse to be able to 

use it. Plus a lot of 

mice track wheels do 

not have 360-degree 

capabilities tike the 

trackball on the 

Apple Mouse. This 

allows you to pan 

large documents and, 

obviously, maneuver 

in all directions. 

This article focuses 
3n the fact that Mac 
took awhile to get 
functions, but that 
was an article that should 
have been written prior to the 
release ofthe mighty mouse in 2005. 

In closing, I feel I should mention 
that if one is unhappy ivith the 
Apple mouse, they can use a Logitec, 
Kensington and even a Microsoft 
Mouse and still be able to use all of its 
functionality on a Apple computer.

Smoke Hut Diaries 



By Robin Crowell 

A topic of discussion rarely 
absent from the smoke hut is dial 
of bragging. Well, bragging merged 
with complaining, that is. Generally 
the complainis revolved around the 
topic of politics, money and IPFW 
in general. One individual, though, 
tends to share his complaints and 
unknowingly steps on others toes in 
doing so. 

Recently Gimp Chris informed 
ihe hut of his triumphs at a casino 
in one of the surrounding cities, 
boasting about his $1,600 doUar 
win. That Is great; congratulations 
by alt means, but please consider the 
following. 



Do not brag about how much 
money you have won and then 
proceed to ask of almost every 
smoker in the hut to bum a 
cigarette. Not only is this just 
nide. ii enttrel&gt;' goes against 
smoker enqueue. 

[f &gt;-ou have won thai much 
nioncv, jvoid talking about it in 
front "I people who vou know 



1 afford 



are broke. I cannot e 
textbooks half of the time, tet 
alone maintiuning my smoking 
habit along with someone else's. 

Informing us once of your 
wiiuiings at a casino is more 
than enough. We do not want to 
hear about it every day foUotving 
your triumph. 

Finally, do not complain 
about money Ever. 



The hut was happy to know that 
the weekend following this valiant 
win al the casino, Gimp Chris 
proceeded to lose the vast majority of 
his winnings. We do not \vish poorly 
upon him at all; however, what ^ve do 
consider this is a lesson in etiquette 
when surrounded by a largely broke 
group of people. 

He lost his money: bring this piece 
to full circle regarding ihecomplaints 
and all. The conversauons switch 
\\ith ease. Bragging ri^ts happen. 
and generally the hut will rejoice 
with the part)' in need of direct 
congramlating. However, what we 
are bragging about one day i 
into a gripe test the follos\ing. Just 
keep thi^ in mind, folks.

I The Community Living A.uisiance Services and Supports (CLASS) Act. propo^ by Ihe 
I laic Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA). a&lt;&gt; chairman of the Senate Health. Education,

The CongieiMonal Budgcl Office found that ihe CLASS Act is sustainable over time, and

E for E-Books 



By Jason Ward 

Imon WAitlOgnull.iom 



Imagine having an entire 
library in your backpack. Imagine 
that library weighs less than a 
pound and has batteries that last 
more than a week. The hiture is 
here; books can be ordered from 
thousands of miles away and 
delivered instantaneously lo a 
device known as an eBook reader. 

Tlie current generation of 
readers feature e-ink displays from 
E-ink Corporation. Developed at 
MITIahs, E-ink is a new technology 
developed to imitate the look of 
printed text on paper this is much 
easier to look at than a computer 
screen. 

The Amazon Kindle was not 
first to the market, but \vith the 
backing of Amazon.com and a 
catalog of over 350,000 eBooks it 
certainly has become the most 
popular. Using Sprint's network, 
the Kindle is able to access 
Amazon's book catalog as well as 
Wikipedia. 

With the release of the Kindle 
DX. Amazon's large screen eBook 



reader, there is promise that 
textbooks may be delivered lo 
this platform. While many of 
the classics may be downloaded 
without charge, it remains 
unknown as to whether this would 
deliver any cost saving benefit to 
students. 

Barnes &amp; Noble has a new and 
interesting entry into the eBook 
reader market and they call it 
the Nook. At the same price as 
die small kindle, the Nook will 
certainly turn heads with its duel 
screens. The top screen is an e-ink 




display while the bollom screen is 
a color touch screen. 

Nook connects to WiFi or 
AT&amp;T's network. Barnes &amp; Noble 
has partnered with Google bonks 
lo offer a catalog of more ihanhalf 
a million books, many of which 
are in ihe public domain and 
absolutely free. 

Both Amazon and Barnes &amp; 
Noble have produced software for 
the iPhone and the iPod touch. 
This sofr.vare offers the ability to 
purchase and read eBooks, though 
the screen may be a bit too small 
for some. 

"I like the feel of a book in my 
hands. The relationship one can 
form with a bookis very tactile, you 
cannot develop that relationship 
with an e-book reader. rm49 years 
old... so I developed my reading 
skills and affection for reading 
with books, not screens," said 
IPFW student, Wayne Huxhold. 

The technology is here, the 
question is will there be a social 
and cultural shift to this new use 
of technology. The Barnes &amp; Noble 
Nook will be available December 
7^; the Amazon Kindle is available 
now.

"How do you make the person 
you are interested In like you?" 



y Devin and Hana 



Giri: You cannot. If someone likes you. Ihey 
will like you. If someone does not, that Is the end; 
you cannot make someone feel a true emotion. 
You can filrt and put yourself way nut there, but 
that does not really make the person honestly 
have feelings for you. Also, you can like someone 

ihoui having romantic feelings for the person. 

When you ate interested in someone, you 
should be yourself. In fact, you should alwiiys he 
yourself in any situation. If someone docs not like 
you, there is nothing wrong with that. I lowever. 
humans should learn to respect people that are 
different from one another, but that does not 
always happen. So, brush off the haters and move 
on; there area billion other people that you can be 
friends with or like. 

Boy:Tlieyalway5sayyou should just be yourself 
when you are trying to get someone lo like you. 
Ultimately, you are Itying lo find the right person 
for you. To find the right person for yourself, you 
have to make surt you are being yourself. If the 
person ends up liking a dilfeient version of you 
that is just a front, then they do not actually like 
you, they like thai different version of yourself. 
Another thing is, you cannot be intimidated. 
Some people get so intimidated by the one they 
are aiming for and pur on a front to hopefully not 
lum them off. They are a human being jusl like 
yourself with fears and insecurities. You do not 
need to be nervous around any human being. If 
you are most comfortable around your friends, 
then just think of them as another ftiend. If that 
person responds to what they see and wants to 
take things a step further then It will eventually 

^ecome apparent. The most Important thing to 
Joiow is that no matter who tikes you or does not 
me you. the most important opinion Is what you 
(hink of yourself. If you get turned down, do not 
let thai inake you think less of yourself. Do not 
measure your self-worth by who ever has a crush 
j&gt;n you. You might just not be each others type. As 
long as you make sure you are a great individual: 
Ibem not being able to recognize that means ihey

As far

Ihe ba.ss lines nre always

The Creepshow is no

The track Demon Lover' 
is sexy, bratty and classic

Paranormal Activity:

This film has

people worse than Vie

Is probably for the fact 
that it was hlmed much 
In the vein of 77ie Blair

nausea efTeci Is pretty 
\'acant because the 
majority of the hlmJng 
takes place with the 
camera stationery on a 
tripod. 

The beginning Is 
slo\\; however. this 
is more effective in 
building up the scares 
for later on In the 
film. Instances do not 
happen right away, 
leaving the audience 
expecting more as the 
film goes on. Another 
effective scare factor in 
this movie Is the lack of 
a musical score, again 
in the vein of a horror 
predecessor The Texas 
Chat maw Massacre. 
The lack of score leaves 
the audience hanging, 
unknowing when the 
demonic presence in

The Man Behind the Curtains 



By Terrence Holiday 

Before seating ourselves on a padded 
bench in the lobby of a nonh end 
campus building, Cbris Nelson, a 
senior who studies theatre there, stood 
waiting outside one of its entryways. 
As he wafted, ashes from his cigarette 
dissolved in the heavy rain, 
A bundle of hair niled his hooded 
jacket and disguised a face that yielded 
little emotion. 

Nelson, who will tell me that people 
describe him as easygoing, did not 
appear bothered by the precipitation 
or my tardiness. He realizes that his 
carefree attitude is a resource for the art 
he creates. "The deadlines associated 
with it can be dreadful," he said, 
ffis work was shown for the play 



Urinetown--3 musical that adapts to 

a water shortage in a ridiculous way 

Nelson had been working on pieces for 

the set on a near full-time schedule for 

over a month. 

Nelson worked with welder's 

equipment and a 

newly purchased 

plasma cutter for 

the production. 

"The plasma 

cutter is a really 

hot torch that 

makes it really 

easy to cut through metal," he said. 

The theatre department also purchased 

steel that Nelson helped fashion into a 

bridge. 



parents have o^vncd and operated a 
Central Ace Hardware store for more 
than 30 years. B&gt;- ihc time Nelsons 
mom had him, the store was about 14 
years old. He helped customers select 
the things that their projects required, 
and it shaped him 



"The thrill will come 

from the audience's 

reaction" 



along the way. 
Ycors later, at 
Carmel High 

School, 'a big 
performance art's 
school," Nelson 
discovered a way 
to pursue his passion by participating 
in theatre set productions. 
His parents have not always cheered 
the direction of their son's career 
Nelson, - tools and building choice, 
materials are literally the family trade. "There's this idea of the starving anist," 
In his hometown of Cannel, IN, his Nelson offered as the reasoning behind 



his dad's Initial skepticism. A tioo^c 
search of 'production designer' would 
eventually erase those doubts 'Once 
he discii\Tred that I could support 
myself.' he has been behind me. 
Nelson declared. 

With family in (own, he'll beam when 
he hnally watches Urinctown. "The 
thrill will come from (he audience'^ 
reaction,' he said, but he'll ptobabty 
play special attention to the Oiled seats 
beside hbii. 

'And when it's all said and done, and 
the cunain closes on the last show, 
there'll be no mixed feelings.' Nelson 
said. 

'It's a relief,' Nelson said about a given 
plays hnal run-- ensuring disassembly 
included. 'You see it so rnnny limes 
that when It's finally over, you're ready 
to move onto the nest thing."

Shop Victoriously: 10 Helpful Tips for eBay Users 



By Craig Lloyd 

caI Ibf cl(E»n«}Ogrruil-C0fn 



flip been an eBay user for a Utile oivr six years now and it's hon- 
estly a primary sourceof income for me duringcollege.l recommend 
other money-deprived college students to get an eBay account. Not 
only do I sell on eBay, but I also buy many of the things I own. Most 
of the time, you can buy things for half the retail price. Here are 
some helpful tips to maximize your eBay experience 



Five Tips for Sellers: 

- Build up a good feedback rating. Most buyers will look at your feedback rat- 
ing to see if you are a reputable eBayer and are worth buying from, so make sure 
that you have a majority of positive comments before you start selling. 

- A picture is worth a thousand words, or in this case, a thousand bids. Take 
good pictures of yout item. No one likes a blurr&gt;- or distoned photo. Take pictures 
at angles in which the item looks most appealing. eBay gives you your first photo 
free and then charges you for each one after that, so make the first photo count! 

- Write a good item description and title. Be as detailed as possible when de- 
scribing your item. Point out any dents or scratches the item may have and where 
they're located. Make &gt;'Our tide search engine friendly by using popular words 
and phrases. 

- -Accept Pa&gt;T)aI as a pajTnent method in your listing. Like I already mentioned. 
Paypal is the preferred \say to pay among eBay users. 

- Act professional. Provide the kind ofcustomer service that will build up your 
reputation. Doing so \vill increase your feedback rating, in turn, giving j-ou a 
greater chance at selling yxiur item at a higher price. 



Five Tips for Buyers: 



- Learn how to snipe. This is a sure-fire way of winning auctions on eBay and 
it's really fun to do. If you know an item will be hot. then learn how to snipe at the 
last minute. Here's how; Open one window with (he auction listing. Open a sec- 
ond window with the same listing and place the highest amount you are willing 
to pay for the item and hit "Place Bid." Now enter your usemame and password 
if you haven't done so already and then it should ask to confirm your bid. Do not 
do this yet. Wait until 10 or 15 seconds before the auction ends, (Refresh your first 
window to keep track of the time left). At the right moment, hit "Confirm Bid", 
With luck, your bid will arrive at the perfect lime to leave your competition in the 
dust, easy win. 

- Use I^ypal. Sellers vrant to be paid quickly and everyone Is concerned about 
fraud. There is no faster or safer way to complete an eBay transaction than by 
using PayPal (owned by eBay). PayPal is used by almost all eBay users and is abo 
frilly in tegrated into eBay. Take the time to become a verified seller and use a veri- 
fied shipping address. This gets you (he fraud protection. Go to Error! Hyperiink 
reference not valid, (o create an account if you haven't already. 

- Check (he seller's feedback rating. You are spending your hardeamed money, 
so i[ pays to check the feedback about the person you're thinking of buying from. 
It's obvious that if you see a bunch of negative comments, stay away from (his 
seller. If you see positive, then proceed but don't let one or two negatives keep 
you away. Everyone makes mistakes and things get lost in the mail. There are also 
some people out (here who are very difficult to please. Also, be careful buyingex- 
pensive items from sellers who are newly registered or have a low feedback raring. 

- Know v.-hat you're bidding on. Take the time to thoroughly read through the 
item's description. E-mail the seller and ask questionsor for clarification about the 
item if need be. Some sellers try to sneak in small text that most buyers wouldn't 
catch Uke "Not sure if item works completely" or "Sold avis." Also, check out what 
the return policy is for the item if it has one.

10. College Football- 
Oklahoma at Nebraska 
In this matchup with

quite competitive. But 
even without Bradford 1 
choose nklalionia to win. 

9. NIIL-Blackhawks

improved but I believe 
the Blackhawks have too 
much talent to lose this 
match up. 

8, College Football- 
South Carolina at Ar- 
kansas. I believe that Ar- 
kansas' QB Ryan Mallet 
will put up big numbers 
in the win. This may hi' 
viewed as an upset. 

7. NDA-we have a 
tie. Suns at Magic on 
Wednesday and Suns at

lieve that the Suns will 
lose both because they 
don't ha\-e as much tal-

Celtics. 

6. NBA-Nuggets Heal

Team captain, senior Jon 
Balyeat, sees future in golf 



By Jessica Williams 

y.ill(i.myil(r1jaahDtmiiir(om 



Ion Balyeat. a senior 
Don golfer (team 
captain, in fact) and 
Business Management 
major, is not the only 
golfer in his family. 

Balyeat said he has 
played golf since he 
was four years old and 
his favorite memories 
Irom growing up come 
from going out to play 
golf with his dad and 
younger brother. His 
favorite place to be is 
Brookwood Golf Club, 
His favorite athlete is 
lack Nicklaus. Even his 
older sister played golf 
in high school. 

The Fori Wayne 
native said he decided 
Id play golf in college 
when he found out he 



could not play football 
anymore when he was 
a senior at Bishop Luers 
High School. 

"I chose to attend 
IPF"W because of the 
local atmosphere 

landl to play golf." said 
Balyeat. 

In the spring of his 
junior ypar at IPFW, 
Balyeat was second 
on the team with an 
average of 75.3 after 
nine rounds. His 
sophomore year, he was 
named to the Division 
I Independent All- 
Academic Team with a 
3.'1 grade point average 
in business. 

In high school. 
he was named All- 
Conference SAC his 
sophomore. junior 
and senior seasons. 
He was the individual 
conference champion 



Bengals. This is a top 
battle between two 
teams fighting for a di- 
vision. I ihink that the 
(cardiac cats) Bengals 
will get past the Ravens 
defense. 

3. NFL-Steelers at 
Broncos. These are two 
of the best in the league 
with top rated defenses. 
With that said I think the 
Steelers can go into Den- 
\'er and pull out a win. 

2. College Football- 
Ohio St. at Penn St. Both 
learns are in a batde for 
the Big Ten title if Io\va 
drops in the coming 
weeks. This game should 



be one of the best of the 
year and 1 choose Penn 
State to win in a close 
one. 

1. College Football- ! 
LSU at .Mabama. Both 
teams are ranked in the 
top ten and fighting for 
the SEC West title. This 
game should be a game 
of defense and the edge 
on that goes to .Mabama 
bui I am picking ihe up- 
set and going with LSU 
to lakedo^^7l undefeated 
.■\Iabama and their for- 
mer coach Nick Saban.

in 2005 and runner-up 
in sectionals. It Is no 
surprise he was named 
MVP at Luers that year. 

Balyeat credits his 
mom for helping him 
get through college. 
(Both his dad and 
brother have passed 
away). 

His favorite ()uotc 
is, "Whatever doesn't 
kill you only makes you 
stronger." 

Although his senior 
season is only half over, 
he has future plans In 
front of him. Balyeat 
warns to enter the PGM 
(Pro Golf Management) 
program with hopes of 
being a PGA member. 

Balyeat concluded 
with something for the 
underclassmen 

'Do not waste your 
time in college because 
it goes way too fasL' 



UPDATE 

The next IPFW men's 
cross country meet 
will take place on 
Saturday, November
