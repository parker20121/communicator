Greek myths 
come alive 



Natural disasters have all the 
elements of high Creek drama: lavish 
sets, great acts of heroism and villany 
and a cast of thousands. 

The Fort Wayne food of 1982 has been 
no different. 

As a matter or Tact, it has been the 
more exciting because, after a hard day 
of filling and stacking sandbags on the 
scenes of the Great Battle, weary 
gladiators could go home and perhaps 
catch a glimpse of themselves on the 
national stage of network news. 

In the tense, heightened drama of the 
shadow play, broadcasters acted as 
Mercury, messenger of the gods, 
spinning the tale in hushed tones. 

There was our commanding general, a 
tall and strong conquering hero ar- 
mored in cotion jacket, directing ihe 
Tire or sandbags, and braving incredible 
dangers to lead his loynl minions in the 
face of seemingly insurmountable odds. 

There were the general's corps 
commanders, who refrained from 
lighting among themselves in order to 
better serve, thinking not of glory or the 
rewards of heroism, but only of saving 
our city in its lime of need. 



In the midst of alt, came a visit from 
the king, coming out of the sky in true 
Sophoclean fashion, cheering us and 
guiding us when circumstances looked 
their worst. 

And. most important but most often 
forgotten, were the hordes, (he "com- 
mon" people who dusted themselves off 
from their usual lives to show thai they 
have at least as much determination and 
heroism in them as any professional 

The villian in this epic is a classic one 
as well— nature, the gods at their most 
malicious and perverse, who seek to 
amuse themselves at (he expense of a 
few worthless lives. 

All of this was told in true Homeric 
style at six and eleven by the modern 
epic pacts of the airwaves. 

Now. as (he waters recede and the 
poets go on to new adventures while we 
mortals seek to clean (he wreckage and 
resume our lives, we can remember that 
for at least one moment the myths came 

, And when it happened, we of Fort 
Wayne were ready and acted our parts 
to the fullest.

every week would turn- on their,
