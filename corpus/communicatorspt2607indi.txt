More than a just a 
video game , the f ran - 
chise known as "Halo" 
has defined the en- 
te rtainment indus - 
try, with a shattering 
day-one sales record, 
initially projected 
to make more than 200 
million dollars on the 
first day , surpassing 
"Halo 2" which made an 
anbarrassing 125 mil-

pated and played across 
the world , "Halo 3" and 
its counter parts have 
cracked the code to a 
successful gaming tril-

equation: graphics,

"Halo" developer Bun-

"Halo 3" looks better

Keeping the prod-

last thing Bungie want-

the look and feel of 
"Halo , " while improving 
the game visually with 
every release. The jump 
from "Halo" to "Halo 2" 
was significant. From

Gala Music Opening at 
new Auer Performance 
Hall showcasing Soloist 
Panayis Lyras and the 
Fort Wayne Philharmonic 



By LOUISA DANIELSON 




October 4, 2007 - the 
brand new Auer Perfor- 
mance Hall is about to 
open with a bang. Solo- 
ist Panayis Lyras will 
perform with the Fort 
Wayne Philharmonic in 
their 7:30 Gala Mu- 
sic Opening. "I look 
forward to visiting. " 

Music of the 
celebration will fea- 
ture Rhapsody in Blue, 
by Gershwin, An Ameri- 
can in Paris, excerpts 
from The Tender Land 
by Copland , and Bern- 
stein's Candide Over- 
ture. 

"I play all 
sorts of music . " stated 
Lyras. In his opinion, 
modern music helps lis- 
teners better under- 
stand music from earli- 
er periods. Composers 
have always stretched 
the forms and rules for 
music. It's like space 
exploration - there's 
always a new frontier 
to explore. When we 
look at modern music . 
we can see the precur- 
sor patterns that in- 
spired it from earlier 

Lyras began 
studying piano at the 
age of four and a half. 
His father was a com- 
poser of popular music 
and had taken classi- 
cal piano lessons as a 
youth. By the age of 
six. Lyras was enrolled 
in the Athens Conserva- 
tory in Greece. 

When his fam- 
ily moved to the United 
States . thirteen year 
old Lyras began to 
study at Jul Hard in 
New York. After com- 



pleting both bachelors 
and masters degrees 
programs there , Lyras 
won the Van Clibum 
piano competition in 
19B1. Since then he has 
taught at Butler Uni- 
versity in Indianapolis 
and four years ago. he 
moved to the Universi- 
ty of Michigan where he 
now serves as Artist in 
Residence . His mother 
and sister still live 
in Indianapolis, where 
his sister teaches bal- 
let. 

Music - espe- 
cially memorizing it 
- takes concentration. 
"A lot of the prac- 
ticing goes on in you 
head," Lyras said. "The 
best way to memorize 
something is to un- 
derstand what is hap- 
pening. . .what is to be 
expected . " This means 
that the musician must 
have aural memory {know 
what the music sounds 
like) tactile memory 
(r member how 
the fingers pattern the 
notes) and visual mem- 
ory (remember what the 
music looks like) . "It 
all works together," he 

When discussing 
the new music 
hall . Lyras 
is excited. 
"I know (Ki- 
erkegaard's) 
work. (They) 
are one of the 
finest acousti- 
cians around." 

In addition 
to the Thursday 
night Gala. Ly- 
ras will also be 
performing again 
on Friday night 
in the smaller 
Rhinehart Recital 
Hall. This con- 
cert will be de- 
voted to more Ro- 
mantic composers 
like Mend els - 

" I ' m 
so excited for 
the campus and 
those that work 
there , " Ly- 
ras said about 
the new music 
building. "I'm 
thrilled."

Childcare delivered 
to IPFW students 



By MELISSA AKAS0N 

altasnaO lfflpfu.edu 

There are students 
at IPFW who have chil- 
dren and need someone 
care for their children 
so they can get an edu- 
cation? 

There is a place on 
campus for any student 
who has a child that is 
need of quality care. 

A place where stu- 
dents can feel com- 
fortable leaving their 
children in the trusted 
hands of the childcare 
staff. 

Along with the conve- 
nience of it being lo- 
cated right across the 
street from campus. 

Over the next few 



weeks . The Communica - 
tor be looking into 
the heart of the IPEU 
childcare program. 
The pros and the cons 
will be explored fcom 
the points of view of 
students, staff, and 
anyone willing to put 
their two cents in! 

First, those of 
you who may not even 
know that there is this 
resource available here 
on campus, and I did a 
little research of my 
own and found that Ivy 
Tech (offers assistance 
with cost). ITT Tech, 
Brown Kackie, and Saint 
Francis do not offer 
childcare to their stu- 
dents, so some of those 
students utilize IPFW's 



childcare. 

The childcare build- 
ing is located at: 
1133 Hobson Road (Cor- 
ner of Hobson Road and 
Stellhom Roads across 
from Speedway) 
Telephone: (260) 481- 
0111. 

Hours of Operation :

Hon.* Thurs. 7:45a.m. -

ning care is dependent

rollment .

Governor who? From where? 

Indiana governor's race heats up around the 
state. ..but where is the political heat at IPFW? 



By ELAINE BAKLE 



Okay . . . and we're 
off _to the race for 
governor . 

Yes. well, only if 
you happen to know that 
there is a race for 
governor. On the cam- 
pus of IPFW, students 
seem to have lost their 
political connection 
to the governor's race 
and in a small body of 
students at Classroom 
Medical the question 
and answer period went 
kind of like this. 

"Hi. I'm a reporter 
for the Communicator 
and would like to know 
what your opinions are 
in the race for gover- 
nor of Indiana . " 

"Uh. is there a race 
for governor? " (Pro - 
fuse laughing by ev- 
eryone) 

"Oh. well. I guess I 
haven't paid that much 
attention to the gov- 

"Gee. Who's run- 
ning, exactly?" 

Alrightie then, let's 
attack this problem 
from a different angle. 



"Hi. I'm a reporter for 
the Communicator and I 
was just wondering if 
you knew WHO the gov- 
ernor of Indiana is?" 
Bewildered looks all 
around . Now . granted . 
this was a group of 
students who were 18 
to 20 years old. but. 
gads , don ' t you think 
they should know who 
the governor is of the 
state they call home? 
Finally . a shout from 
the crowd. 

"Oh. that, that . . 
. um. my man Mitch!" 

"Oh, yeah. He's that 
guy who leased the toll 
roads to some other 
country. 



Listen up, my fellow 
Dons! We are taking a 
stroll down Governor's 
Lane, today and come 
Election Day, which is 



not the front 

so let's not pull a 

that thread. 

The front runners ii 
this race will undoubt 
edly 



"Uh, is there a race 

for governor?" 1^1 
(Profuse laughing by p-nii 
everyone) 



1 1 



Yes ! Now w 



e get- 



ting somewhere. "Well 
then, do you know who 
the leading Democratic 
candidate for governor 
is?" Blank stares, 

followed by furrowed 
brows , followed by 
painful expressions of 
ignorance - 

"Ah . . . no." 

"Ho." 

"No." 

"No." 

"Well, thanks for 
that. Now I know what 
this article will re- 
ally be about." 



Nov. 4. 2008. 

I hope you are thank- 
ful for this small bit 
of information that 
should launch you into 
an insatiable frenzy of 
political awareness. 

Thus far, there are 
three Democratic can- 
didates for governor 
of Indiana. 

They are Jill 
Long Thompson, Jim 
Schel linger and Richard 
D. Young. Jr. Governor 
Mitch Daniels decided 

to run for reelection 
on June 16, 3007 as. of 
course, the Republican 
candidate. 

There are other peo- 
ple who have given the 
governor ' s seat some 
thought, but they are 



an advocate for work- 
ing families and con- 
scientious, approach- 
able government. 

She was a member of 
the U.S. House of Rep- 
resentatives (in Hark 
Souder's seat) from 
1989 to 1995. Her most 
recent political posi- 
tion was as U.S. Under 
Secretary of Agricul - 
ture from 1995 to 2001. 
Oddly enough, as a Dem- 
ocrat in Congress she 
opposed tax increases 
and at the same time 
defended funding for 
education. Medicare 
and Social Security . 
As Under Sec- 
retary of Ag- 
riculture, she 
restructured 



the single- family loan 
program which generat- 
ed jobs in communities 
that were struggling 
financially. 

Hitch Daniels or "My 
Man . Mitch" has been 
Indiana's • governor 
since January 2005. 

In 2001 . he was the 
director of the Office 
of Management and Bud- 
get (CMB) after being 
appointed by Presi- 
dent George W. Bush. 
He held this position 
from 2001 to 2003. 

While he was direc-

As governor of In-

Police in Boston 

Mistake LED Display, 
Play-Doh for Bomb 



Star Simpson, a 19- 
yearold HIT student, 
was arrested Friday for 
entering Boston's Lo- 
gan Airport with what 
authorities believed 
to be a bomb strapped 
to her chest. 

According to an ar- 
ticle in The Boston 
Globe. Simpson was 
wearing a sweatshirt 
with a- circuit board 
attached to the front. 
The circuit board 
had a star-shaped dis- 
play of T.Fn lights pow- 
ered by a 9-volt bat- 
tery connected with 
loose wires . Simpson 
was also carrying a 
lump of Play-Doh. which 
authorities mistook for 
explosives. The Play- 
Doh was not attached to 
the circuit board. 

Simpson was stopped 
outside the terminal by 
police officers armed 
with submachine guns. 
According to CMN.com. 
Simpson was arrested 
and charged with disor- 
derly conduct and car- 
rying a "hoax device." 
a felony. 

After her arrest, 
Simpson explained that 



she had come to the 
airport to pick up her 
boyfriend, who was ar- 
riving on a flight from 
Oakland. California. 

The circuit board 
was a "piece of art" 
she had built to catch 
the attention of poten- 
tial employers during 
MIT's career fair. 

According to reports 



leased on $750 bail and 
is awaiting her hear- 
ing, scheduled for Oct.

citizens spotted sever- 
al LED displays placed 
on buildings and under 
bridges and overpasses 
around the city.

from the Associated 
Press . the commanding 
officer at Logan Air - 
port. Maj. Scott Pare, 
stated that Simpson was 
"lucky she followed the 
instructions or deadly 
force would have been 
used! .. .she's lucky'to 
be in a cell as opposed 
to the morgue. ' ' 

While many early me- 
dia reports referred 
to the circuit board 
as a "fake bomb. " at 
this time, there does 
not appear to be any 
evidence that Simpson 
actually intended to 
deceive anyone or cause 

Simpson has been re- 



ing an 
obscene gesture. When 
police were called in 
to investigate . the 
displays were -thought

The displays were 
later determined to be 
part of a marketing

later, the Boston bcsnb 
detonated a plastic

Many students would

a few quick, free ways 
that students can use 
their computers to make

able to get their child 
in due to limited re- 
serve space. . .which is 
another thing that I 
am going to look into. 
I want to know so that 
I can tell you what it 
is that the University 
can do to expand the 
building size so that 



more students and com- 
munity members here in 
Fort Wayne can consider 
their education more 
of a possibility than 
a financial burden. 
Increasing the enroll- 
ment numbers may allow 
for a decrease. in the 
hourly costs to stu- 
dents, staff, and non- 
students. Also, they 
would have more room 
for increasing their 
employees, which means 
more jobs for the city 
of Fort Wayne. 

But this is all specu- 
lation for now... could 
IPFW do more to help 
the community by taking 
a closer look at the 
childcare facility? Is 



there really that much 
of a need for a bigger 
building? Would there 
be a increase in en- 
rollment for childcare 
if the cost was less 
for students, facul- 
ty, and nonstudents? 
And with that in mind, 
would there be an in- 
crease in the enroll- 
ment to IPFW because of 
the childcare as an op- 
tion for parents?

Once the concept be- 
hind how "Halo" was to 
function, it was im- 
portant for Bungle to 
update the weaponry 
and create a balance 
between than. 

An example would be 
the pistol in the first 
"Halo." which if mas- 
tered could be an over- 
ly dominant arm. It was 
rapid and its scoping 
capability allowed for 
long distant accuracy. 
It practically made the 
sniper obsolete. 

In "Halo 2" the 
covenant plasma sword 
became available and 
locked on to opponents 
at such a distance that 
close range kills were 



obnoxious. It would be 
come strategy just t&lt; 
obtain the weapon si 
kills would be easier. 
On the other hand 
locking on with the 
rocket launcher was ad 
justed to be more chal 
lenging and realistic 
On the same note, thi 
pistols scope was re 
moved and the sniper 
got the recognition it 
deserved. 

"Halo 3" offers a 
more extensive variety 
of artillery and vehi- 
cles with weapon bal- 
ance reexamined . Some

The Mongoose is a smaller version

might be excited to learn that the game 
also has it's own official drink. It is 
from the makers of Mountain Dew and it 
is called Game Fuel. The new drink fea-

The 'Final Fantasy' 
Just Won't End 



Classic Games Back From the Dead 



video game consoles have 
collectively brought us

support and the

es . displaying jumbled 
graphics, and requires 
then to remove the car- 
tridge and blow in it 
before playing again . 
effectively ruining 
their day. and causing 
a potential 
fight or two 
in the pro- 



with the X-Box live Ar- 
cade. The classic games 




by many 

in the form of the abil- 
ity to download classic 
games long cherished - or 
forgotten - through each 
systems online store. 

Those familiar with 
video game emulators 
have had access to many 
of these gaming staples 
for years - 



would say 
it's even better than 
the real thing. 

For example, if you 
have a shiny new PS3 , 
and you sold all of your 



old 






to buy it, you may find 
yourself missing 'Crash 
Bandicoot ' . This game 



these titles is rela- 
tively low , but let ' s 
faces it. if you can af- 
ford a PS3 or an X-Box 
360. you can afford an 
occasional classic down- 
load. 

Another exciting fea- 
ture of the two afore- 
mentioned services is 
that they frequently 
offer original games 




of classic 
gamers are quick 
mit that there is noth- 
ing like playing these 
games with a 20-year- 
old controller in hand, 
on a television the way 
they were intended to be 
played. They will swear 



at the Play- 
Store. purchase 
the game, and download 
it fot play not only on 
your new PS3, but also 
on your portable PSP if 
you have one. 

It's the same concept 



for download, and these 
aren't all old-school in 
nature, as evidenced by 
"Tekken 5: Dark Resur- 



rection' . an upgraded 
game offered exclusive- 
ly from the Playstation 
Store. This game is phe- 
and 
this approach 

ing games on- 
line is only 
expected to 
grow. It may 

jump aboard. 
That 
brings us to 
the Wii Vir- 
tual Console 

garnet's dream 

Did you own an B-bit 
NES? Of course you did! 
How about a SNES. Sega 
Genesis, or NEC Tux- 
bografx-16? It almost 
doesn't matter, because 
there are games from each 
system offered through 
Nintendo' s service . and 
new games are released 

Maybe you never 
thought you would play 
the original 'Sonic the 
Hedgehog' on a Nintendo 
home console, but now 
you can. it won't freeze 
on you. and you can turn 
it off halfway through 
a level and continue at 
a later date from that 
very same point. 

Of course, there are 
always the essential Ma- 
rio and Zelda games as 
well. 

Though some have 
aged better than others, 
there has never been a 
better time to be a nos- 
talgic gamer, and there 
is much more on the way. 
Have fun! 



The 



'Final Fantasy' 



of 



that one either loves 
or hates (or both). Ar- 
guably one of the most 
popular series of all 
time, there has been 
nothing final about it. 
The original game has 
spawned 12 sequels and 
numerous spin-offs, as 
well as novels, animes, 
and full-length feature 
films. If the newest 
releases in the series 
are any indication, the 
craze won ' t be ending 
anytime soon, as Square 
Enix - the company be- 
hind the games - has 
re- released the first 
2 titles in the series 
on the Sony PSP to cel- 
ebrate their 20th an- 
niversary. 

The original Final 
Fantasy was released on 
the NES way back in the 
80s before electricity 
was discovered - okay, 
maybe it wasn't that 
bad back then. 

As a top-down, pro- 
gressive role playing 
experience with a de- 
tailed storyline, it 
became a hit worldwide. 
Its sequel was not re- 
leased in the states 
until ' Final Fantasy 
Origins' came out for 
the PS1 in 2003. 

The version that we 
called "Final Fantasy 
2" was actually 'Final 
Fantasy V in Japan.

tively confusing gam- 
ers stateside when the 
series jumped straight 
from 3 to 7. 

Now, gamers on this 
side of the Atlantic 
have access to each 
game in series, and to 
top it off. the missing 
pieces play much better 
in their updated forms 
than their original in- 
carnations did. 

These remakes for 
the PSP are essentially 
the same as the Gameboy 
Advance incarnations 
known as ' Final Fan- 
tasy: Dawn f Souls' . 
only the graphics are 
greatly enhanced. 

These games make full 
use of the high resolu- 
tion PSP screen, giving 
2D gaming fans some- 
thing to celebrate. 

There are new CGI 
openings and endings 
for each (carried over 
from the PS1 incarna- 
tion, the musical score 
is has been revamped, 
and the game simply 
plays phenomenally. 

Fans of the SNES in- 
carnations will feel 
right at home, and 
anyone who ' s already 
played through these 
games before will find 
more to do in the form 
of new dungeons exclu- 
sive to these remakes. 

These games scream 
quality, and fans of 
the series will not be 
disappointed . 

Don't hesitate to 
relive the beginnings 
of the never-ending

He 



is Alabaster

they are Alabas-

about preforming 
when I stepped 

Andrea, who has been 
a vocalist for most of 
her "life,- 1 joined Ala-

Their performane - 
ate unique in that 



and progres - 
sion of mixed music 
and mediums. Alabaster 
Foxs' versatility and 
personal lyrics create 
and build up quite an 
exciting musical expe- 
rience . 

"I try to write per- 
sonal lyrics . " said 
C.Ray, adding, "It's 
personally ... "expressive. 



t Essentially, its

While the lyrics ex-

ations and religion, 
both positive and nega- 
tive aspects, the sound 
is influenced by Xiu- 
Xiu. Modest House. Co- 
corosie , Wolf parade . 
and Arcadefire. 

Host -interestingly-- 

is the hip-hop. feel, 
delicately sprinkled 
throughout the indie 
sound . C.Ray . seeming- 
ly open-minded with his 
choice for music say 
he likes "real issue 
rapping" from artists 



like Killer Mike. Com- 
mon, Lupe Fiasco, and 
Dj Girl Talk. 

When it comes down 
to these two and their 
potential in the music 
industry. C.Ray ex- 
presses his longing de- 
sire for people to hear 
what he has to say. "I 
know people down play 
fame and popularity- 
but it's a pretty big 
deal." 

More importantly 
Alabaster Fox is con- 
fident that their music 
delivers a very unique 
aspect to the local 
scene. "On a Fort Wayne 
level we're good. But, 
I dpn't think there is 
anything ground break- 
ing about our music and 
■1 find that senselessly 
depressing." 

Keeping in mind that 
Alabaster Fox is capa- 
ble of doing their own 
marketing (the firefly 
advertisement was made 
by Andrea) and music, 
the team definitely un- 
derstands -what it takes - 
to succeed . Their spe-
