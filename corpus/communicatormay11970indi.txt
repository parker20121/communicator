PSA Sweeps Election 



The posters are down, 
the flyers are in the 
trash cans, the cam- 
paign buttons remain 
as either pleasant or 
unpleasant reminders 
and now we have a new 
student body president- 
Scott Gillie. 

At approximately 
9:00 p. mo on the even- 
ing of April 28 the 
suspense began as the 
voting machine was 
rolled in the Receiving 
and Service Room on the 
ground floor, like a 
pregnant mother-to-be 
being taken to the de- 
livery room. Trail- 
ing behind were approx- 
imately 30 anxious 
"parents" — party can- 
didates and loyal sup- 
porters — who began 
their agonizing vigil. 
Into the forbidden 
chamber filed the "se- 
lect few" who would be 
the first to know the 
winning candidates. 
The select ffroup con- 
sisted of Dean Manges, 
Mr, Jim Bolinger, Prank 
Akey (President of the 
Elections Board), Bob 
Prough( Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court), 
Maurice Emery, Bob 
A'Hearn (President of 
Student Union Board), 
and the two president- 
ial candidates — --Murk 



Souder and Scott Gillie. 
Between 9:05 and 9:15 
there were intermittent 
cases of near "heart 
attacks" as those ws^lt- 
tng outside saw the 
door open and a person 
emerge. Unfortunately 
the person who went in 
and out of the room 
knew nothing of the out* 
come or at least they 
didn't acknowledge it» 
So anxiety prevailed 
as the mood of the eve- 
ning until 9:15. After 
an eternity of ten min- 
utes complete with 
sweaty hands, finely 
chewed fingernails, and 
worried express ions j 
Scott Gillie entered 
the "waiting room" to 
make the announcement. 
Was it a boy or a girl? 
Neither one--it was PSA 
as was evident by Gil- 
lie's victorious grin. 
Of the 85l votes cast, 
the breakdown was 5^4-0 
votes for the Progres- 
sive Student Alliance 
and 311 votes for the 
Action Party. 

And now the caval- 
cade of candidates has 
passed bef*ore us. Some 
of them have met defeat 
and the others w ill a s- ' 
amne office. As for 
the future --we 11, that 
remains to be seen.

Wasted Money? 

by Jennifer Bosk 

For most of the year people have written to the newspaper wanting to 
know where all the activity fee money went. After we published the bud- 
geti we received more letters and comments demanding more "show" 
for the fee, and many comments slammed Student Government arid^the 
Student Union Board fcr this. 

It seemed quite a large sum went to the Student Union Board, and most 
of it was used in the planning of HarbarArbar days. So all of a sudden 
the "show" that students bellowed all year for began Saturday night. The 
kickoff for HarbarArbar days was a dance featuring the fantastic "Pure 
Funk" from Bloomington. 

. Great! Here comes the biggest social event of the year and only 75 
people show. WhyTWho knows^^ll I can say is that the fault now does not 
lie with Student Government-it lies with yourselves. It's your money, 
your fun, and your yelled-for activity fee "show". Yes--it's YOUR waste- 
fulness!!!

Letters 
to the editor 



Dear Miss Bosk: 

I have a few comments that I would 
like to make regarding the COMMUNI- 
CATOR. These comments were con- 
sidered many times before the decision 
was made to write you a letter concern- 
ing them. I hope these comments will 
not be taken as an overly critical I'uw 
of your newspaper, but as constructive 
criticism. 

I would like to start with the fact 
that you write a very decent newspaper. 
The articles in it are informative and 
seem to be correct and to the point 
The way the paper is put together on an 
overall basis shows the ability of the 
staff to create a newspaper of high 
caliber in regard to the caliber of the 
college and the students this paper repre- 
sents. 

The only critical view I have of your 
newspaper is that your efforts to make 
it a better than average newspaper are 
goint to waste. If you are going to 
have an above-average publication, von 
must do a good job on every aspect of 
it. The typing and the typographical 
ERRORS that are made take a lot away 
from it. Being a secretary, I know that 
when you start to read a letter, a paper 
or book, such glaring errors really make 
you wonder why these people even at- 
tempt to get a message across if they 
overlook errors instead of correcting 
them. 

You have a great newspaper as far 
as content is concerned; just get rid of 
those errors and make it the best news- 
paper there is at a college with the high 
standards of Indiana-Purdue! 

Sincerely, 

Carolyn Brown

Athletic Facilities Begin Expansion 



by Danrell Parnin 
Yesterday, the Joint Committee 
on Athletic Affairs held its organ- 
izational meeting. Seated on the 
eleven member Committe are: ex 
officio, the Coordinator of Student 
Activities, Mr. Bolinger (until such 
time as a administrative person re- 
sponsible for athletics is on the 
staff); three (3) faculty members 
from Indiana University; Dr. 

Virginia Craig, Dr. V. Randolph 
Kirby, and Dr. Geoffrey Mathews; 
three (3) faculty members from 
Purdue University: Dr. Ronald 
Emery, Dr. Joshua Gerow, and Dr. 
Charles McKinley; two (2) students 
from Indiana University: Tom 
Newman and Chuck Rossman; two 
(2) students from Purdue Univer- 
sity: Darrell Parnin and Diane 
Fridley. 

The Joint Athletic Committe by 
various budgetary approvals will • 
seek to establish a program for girls 
and general student use. Areas to be 
put under consideration will be an 
intramural volleyball program, the 
erection of an archery range, and 
the construction of a convertible 
tennis court-ice skating rink. Equip- 
ment for use of the tennis court 
(rackets and balls), and archery 
(various pound pullage bows) 
would also be considered for pur- 
chase at such a time with the athle- 
tic fee. Those who pay the activity 
fee or purchase an activity card 
will be aloud use of the equipment 
if purchased, through a check-out 
system and use of the outdoor 
facilities. 

Other budgetary approvals for 
and discussions concerning the all- 
purpose field across the river (shown 
in the artist sketch drawing) will be 
undertaken. Items to be discussed 
include a picnic grounds in area 
(A) of the sketch; a soccer field in 
area (B); and other facilities for the 
benefit and use of the students at- 




tending the Regional Campus. The 
area already has marked off parking 
and a pubhc boat launch site. 

The duties of the Joint Athletic 
Committee are 1) to approve the 
annual athletic budget, both intra- 
mural and intercollegiate, and sup- 
porting activities. The budget will 
be submitted by the Coordinator of 
Student Activities. Marking as one 
of their first duties is the approval 
of submitted bids for a softball 
diamond. It should be mentioned 
that an athletic budget cannot be 
passed without this committee's 
approval; 2) to approve schedules 
for intercollegiate athletics; 3) to 
establish eligibility requirements for 
participation in intercollegiate athle- 
tics. 

Further duties are 4) to approve 
participation in an intercollegiate 
activity; including post season ac- 
tivities, with the consent of .Fort 
Wayne senates of Indiana and 
Purdue University; 5) to establish 
and approve ticket pricing policy 
and seating allocations; 6) to estab- 



lish policies and procedures for ath- 
letic awards, such as letters, jackets, 
etc.; 7) to propose, for the approval 
of the Fort Wayne senate, member- 
ship in athletic conferences; 8) to 
serve in an advisory capacity to the 
director of the athletic program; 
9) in cooperation with the Admis- 
sions Office, to determine alio - 
cation of athletic grants when avail- 
able in accordance with conference 
policies; and 10) to reccomend to 
the Dean of Purdue University the 
appointment of the Director of In- 
tercollegiate Athletics and the Di- 
rector of Intramural Programs. 

Faculty appointments to the 
committee are made for three years, 
with one appointed each year. The 
faculty of each institution deter- 
mines t he mechanism b y which 
thefacuTty appointments are made. 
The stu dent app ointments are made 
for two years, with one appointed 
each year from each institution. The 
President of the Student Body, with 
the assembly's approval, appoints 
the student members.

BOLINGER... 
A MAN ON THE 
GO 

by Teresa Larson 

James Bolinger, who is now ser- 
ving as Coordinator of Student Ac- 
tivities on this campus received his 
B. A. in psychology in 1966 from 
Northern University. He worked in 
vocational rehabilitation in Detroit 
his first year, in Tiffin, Ohio, for 
about six months, and in Chicago 
for about fourteen months. He 
heard about his present job from a 
friend he was working with at a 
summer agency who had held the 
positionTwo years ago. At the pre- 
sent time he is also workin g towar ds 
his Masters Degree in psychology at 
St. Francis College. 

Mr. Bolinger resides in Fort 
Wayne with his wife, Judy, and 
his three and a half year-old son, 
David. Basketball, softball-really 
all sports-interest him. 

He enjoys working with college 
students and feels that this campus 
has "great potential for growth." 
One of his goals is to strengthen the 
Greek system at lU-Purdue. The 
other one, which is in the planning 
stages, is to have a regional campus 
athletic conference among the 
state universities besides starting 
intramural sports for girls and possi- 
bly intercollegiate sports such as 
tennis and cross country.

''WALK" 
Makes It 



More than 1,200 people from 
the Fort Wayne area took part in 
the "Walk for Development" spon- 
sored by the American Freedom 
from Hunger Foundation 

The walkers left from Zollner 
Stadium at 9:30 a.m. Sunday and 
proceeded to cover the 24 mile 
route. Of those that managed to 
last throughout the entire walk, 
many were limping from their tired 
legs or complaining about their sun- 
burn. The youngest of the walkers 
was only 1 1 years old, and the Old- 
est was Sister M. Maris, who listed 
her age as "50 plus." 

It is not known at this time how 
much money was obtained in the 
form of pledges, but it is estimated 
that it could total as much as 
$15,000. 



Students wishing to apply for a 
Rhodes of Marshall Scholarship are 
reminded that the deadlines for 
applications are early next fall.; 
Marshall, October 22, and Rhodes, 
October 31. Since these deadlines 
are early, Professor A. Rolfs, Pur- 
due representative for national 
graduate fellowships, suggest that 
it would be advisable to have fac 
ulty recommendations of possible 
nominees before the end of the 
current semester. 

Faculty members who wish to 
sponsor certain students of the 
requisite caliber and interest are 
urged to send names of students to, 
or have the students visit Professor 
Rolfs at his office in West Lafay 
ette.

The Threat of Impatience 

A fundamental threat to the survival of the university is impatience. 
While destructivencss is limited to a very small number, and while 
romantic visions of the university as a misty community vv'ithout form 
or authority are confined to a minority, impatience is pervasive. 

One target of impatience is inaction. Its stimulus is the daily intimacy 
with the horrors of war, poverty, violence, and oppression — all brought 
into the parlor on the television screen. 

Another target of impatience is complexity. Hate and love seem so 
simple, so obvious and direct. Yet the structures of a technological 
society and its government seem hopelessly complicated, beyond the 
reach of most, seemingly unmanageable even to the few who do grasp 
Ihe levers of power. 

A third target of impatience is doubt. With a world to be saved, or 
simply a life to be lived, there is an overpowering urge to insulate 
yourself from the nagging, nibbling doubts which seem to spoil every 
confident hope and tarnish even the most ecstatic dream. Dogmatic 
assertion is a great relief. To some, blind fanaticism is "beautiful." 

Patience, we urge, but patience without purpose is boredom. So 
"relevance" becomes the slogan of an impatient generation. Their plea 
is for release from the tedium of learning without purpose. 

Better they should cry "significance," for the crisis of purpose tran- 
scends topical problems. Today's problem could be "solved," and still 
the vacuum of purpose would sap the patience which learning requires. 

I do think we should be more forthcoming in our admission of the 
weaknesses and contradictions in our university inheritance. We should 
recognize and admit that the university is not for all people, nor for 
most people at all times of their lives. It is not even the only or, for 
many, even the best circumstance for learning. Action, too, has its claim 
as a teacher of wisdom. Capacity can be extended and enlarged by 
doing as well as by thinking. 

Wc should recognize also that, as knowledge does become more 
relevant to operational decisions, universities do have an increasing 
professional and clinical function, for the potential operator as well as 
for the scholar. The applications of learning once associated primarily 
with law and medicine and engineering must spawn analogous applied 
sciences in social and environmental studies. 

Most of all, we should admit that not all scholarship and learning 
are equally significant. The quality of intellectual excitement depends 
on whether the scholar is truly opening a new perspective or is simply 
accumulating data which do not themselves contribute to understanding. 
Definitiveness should not excuse the want of significance. 

We must even admit that reason is not the only clue to truth. 
Intuition and creative imagination have their role in perception as well 
as in expression, in learning as well as in life. Not all that is perceived 
can be analyzed, let alone weighed or measured. Not all that is worth 
expressing can be "programmed." Not all that is "true" can be proved 
by objective evidence. 

We should admit all this. Wc should leave room for — we should 
positively encourage — intuition, imagination, and the affirmation of 
revealed truth, even within the academy. We can acknowledge all these 
things, but wc must continue to assert that impetuous action, conscious 
oversimplificalion, refusal to doubt, and the rejection of reason are 
enemies of the university.

Swinging - Hoosiers Are Back ! 



Ten thousand miles, 
twenty-nine days, foui»- 
teen weary students, 
one haggard faculty 
member, and a million 
happy memories made up 
I1S0 Tour GA616. When 
the tour left Port 
Wayne we could hardl;y 
believe that all the 
rehearsals, passport ap- 
plications and tetanus 
shots were finally over 
and we were on our way. 
Twenty-six long hours 
after leaving Fbrt 
Wayne we arrived in 
Thule, Greenland, The 
eight girls on the toup 
have probably never had 
so much attention in 
their lives. In 
Greenland there is a 
saying thai; there is a 
girl behind every tree. 
The only catch is that 
there are no trees in 
Greenland. 

At every station 
we were warmly greeted 
and well received. We 
sang thirty performan- 
ces for audi&lt;5nces rang- 
ing in size from ?S at 
a remote radar site in 
Greenland to 500 in the 
base theater at Kef- 
lavik, Iceland. In 
addition to our club 
and theater performan- 
ces we also sang five 
programs at the depen- 
dent schools located 
at the large bases in 
Labrador, Newfoundland, 
and Iceland. 

The tour was certain- 
ly not all worko There 
was lots of time for 
playing tourist. Tom 
Stucky fished in Wew- 
foundland, Jeanne Hoff- 
man and Dave Kuebler 



shopped everywhere, 
"Doc" Harper collected 
rocks and lava, Char- 
lene Post danced, and 
eight of us Bent swim- 
.mlng in the outdoor 
polls in Reyjavik, 

What were the high- 
lights of the Tour? How 
can one explain the 
many experiences that 
were ours? To some it, 
may have been singing 
in the Catholic and 
Protestant Chapel ser- 
vices on Easter Sunday. 
Our choir was composed 
of military and civi- 
lian personnel and se- 
veral of the Danish 
civilians from Dundas 
Village, To others the 
highlight may have been 
the professional demands 
required of all of us. 
The rugged beauty of tie 
polar ice cap and the 
icebergs or the first 
time we saw open water 
in Labrador may have 
been the memorable time 
for some. To all of us 
I am sure that there is 
a deep sense of grati- 
tude that you, through 
United Community Ser- 
vices, helped send us 
and that we are a part 
of a Univeriity that 
will allow us to parti- 
cipate^ in such an expei* 
ience. It is diTficult 
to express the feelings 
and relationships expei»- 
ienced on such tour. As 
director of the group 
I can only say that we 
represented our univer- 
sity well and I feel 
sure that each of us 
would welcome tha 
opportunity to make a- 
nother tour if we 
should be chosen again. 



THANK YOU 
STUDENTS \ 



Prom responses that 
I have received. Earth 
Day-April 22, 1970-was 
a success. When asked 
if we would do it agaii&gt; 
there was a resounding 
"yes"; and due to this 
response, a student En- 
vironmental Organiza- 
tion is being formed 
here on campus just to 
illustrate that our ef- 
forts would not cease 
on April 23, 

The success of this 
effort is attributed to 
the countless number of 
students who partici- 
pated in Earth Day ac- 
tivities. Granted, 
there were specific 
committees of people 
who worked from the 
very beginning of the 
preparation. However, 
there is a vast number 
of students who gave 
assistance that did not 
receive recognition for 
their efforts. 

I stated many times 
during the past few 
weeks that I have never 
seen an organization 
working toward a goal 
on this campus receive 
as much responsible 
cooperation from every 
student as this coali- 
tion did. For this I 
am pleased and proud of 
my fellow students. A 
sincere note of thanks 
is to be given to this 
student body that cer- 
tainly demonstrated an 
attack against apathy 
that we have so often 
been accused of.

your opinion of the e- 
lertlon results?" 
Daniel C . Sutmonds- If 
they {f/s.kj) So^half

do OK, Where were they 
when paid parking was 
an issue? A. P. shall

Glynn Croge - I was dis- 
appointed th at more in- 
dependents weren't run- 
ning. It wasn't sur- 
prising that P.S.A, woi) 
it was expected. It 
isn't going to change 
that much: new people- 
same thing. 

Dana Christie - It would 
have been better if 
there had been a more 
equal distribution sn 
we could have two dif- 
ferent approaches to 
all upcoming situationa 
Larry Johnson - The re- 
sults were like I ex- 
pected. Just from 
talking to people, Mark 
Souder wasn't too well 
like&lt;S and was blamed 
for a lot of things 
that happened like Paid 
Parking and I think 
that is why P.S.A » won. 
Rex Pranger - I feel it 
would "be "nice if they 
would follow their 
platform and carry it 
out. I think a few of 
the goals are a little 



unreal but are good to 

dream about. It will

VIEWS OF THE 



by Sandy Bradway 

The elections are over, the drama 
of who will win is now forgotten, 
and anticipation fills the air as this 
new Senate goes into office. When 
talking to the new Student Govern- 
ment members today, 1 noticed 
an ambitious and anxious attitude 
amonq all thejiew members. They 
seem to be eager and ready to take 
over their new jobs and responsi- 
bilities. 

The new Student Body President, 
Scott Gillie, is a junior at lU ma- 
joring in Sociology. He has no pre- 
vious experience in Student Govern- 
ment, but said he is ready to get 
down to work and learn. He said , 
. that the initial relief of having won&lt; ' 
is wearing off as he realizes the 
work that has to be done. He also 
said that one of the main things^ 
they wanted to do was build a bet- 
terTine of communication withthe 
students. They would like to do 
this through personal contact, va- 
rious publications, and speeches,to 
let the students know what is going 
on in Student Government. He said 
he feels they have an ambitious plat- 
form, a nd a lot of work to d o. 

Kent Stier, our new Student 
Body V'ce President, . a junior at 
lU majo ring in So ciology.His reac- 
tion to his party's victory 
was that they have a lot of work 
ahead of them. He said they would 
take action against paid 

^.^^'^JJ^; ^."1.^° everything they 
could to tight it. He saia irtey wiJ 

maintain contact with the students 
personally, and make the minutes 
of all their meetings readily avail- 
able to the students. 

The newly elected student sen- . 
ators had this to say: Jim 

Hultiquist a sophomore majoring in 
secondary education at lU, said 
that he was very happy and elated 



that the party made such a clean 
sweep. He said they would work 
to see the activity fee lowered.and 
he would J_ike_tg see the money 
being spent itimized so they would 
know exactly where it is going and 
how it is being spent. 

Tom Newman, a student senator 
from last term, is a sophomore maj- 
oring in business administration at 
lU. He said he would like to see 
paid parking stopped, and a joint 
government of faculty, adminis- 
tration, and students started here 
on campus. 

Karen Nill, a junior at lU maj- 
oring in history, said she was very 
i happy her party won. She said she 
wanted to see some form of def- 
inite communication between the 
senate and the students started. 

Hal Meyers, a junior at lU maj- 
oring in Sociology, said that he had 
"mixed emotions" when he heard 
of the PSA victory. First of all, 
he feels that the students in the 
PSA party are "conscientous stu- 
dents" with "admirable goals" but 
that the problems of student go- 
vernment are not solved by the 
elections because the inconsidera- 
tion of administrative decisions 
still exists. A. id until students^ u- 
nify into a bloc as the administra- 
tion has, "it is meaningless to talk 
about such things as a campus 
parliament." 

Bernice Dammeyer, a Freshman 
majoring in Medical Records at lU, 
was a Student Senator this past 
term. She said she was very glad 
that they won, and that this new 
party will be able to do something 
for the school, as the others have 
previously said. She also would 
like to see a better line of commu- 
nication between the students and 
the senate so that they will know 



what the students want, ..She also 
said this term she would like to 
work on more committees, and she 
would like to work to do away with 
paid parking. 

Bonnie Bunch, a Sophomore ma- 
joring in Special Education at lU, 
said that she was surprised that 
she won, but she had a lot to learn 
and a lot of work to do now. She 
said she would like to see the Senate 
as a "go-between" for the students 
and the administration. She said 
there are a lot of things on the 
platform she would like to see get 
done, and she would work to see 
these things get done. 

Gary McOmber said he was sur- 
prised his party made such a clean 
sweep but was glad of the fact. He 
is a freshman majoring in engineer- 
ing at Purdue. He said that he 
would like to see more students in- 
volvement and more things done 
for the students. 

Kathy Clevenger, a freshman ma- 
joring in Math at Purdue, said she 
had a lot of confidence in the 
party and was sure they would 
win. The main thing to get ac- 
complished this year, according to 
her, is to get the money situation 
straightened out. 

Paul Pratico said he would like 
to help develop a more active stu- 
dent body, and be able to go back 
to the students to find out what 
they thing and want. He said he 
would also like to establish a feel- 
ing of partidpatson for the night- 
time students. Paul is a Sophomore 
majoring in Sociology at lU. 

Kathy Knopp, a Freshman at Pur- 
due majoring in Pharmacy, was e- 
lated that their party had won the 
elections. She said, as others have, 
more student involvement and bet- 
ter communications between the 
Cent, on pgo 9 



Gov* Members: 
Cont. from p^, 8 

students and Student Government 
are needed. According to her if the 
students were better informed, 
there would be so much more that 
could be done. 

"We intend to try to hold up the 
platform" was a statement made by 
Bea Chipko, a junior majoring in 
Theater at Purdue. She also said 
that they intend to try to repre- 
sent all students. 

Stan Giant feels it is great that 
the party won as a whole. He is a 
Freshman majoring in engineering 
at Purdue. He said he would like to 
see the PSA platform fulfilled, and 
better student participation on the 
different projects. 

"I was totally amazed at the 
whole party winning" was the reac- 
tion from Dianne Fridley, a junior 
majoring in Theater at Purdue. 
She said she would like to see the 
administration asking for the stu- 
dents' advice, and the "mickey 
mouse" in Student Government 
substantially reduced. 

Violence 
Results-- 

As a result of the 
violence that broke out 
at the April 13th and 
17th dances the follow- 
ing four suggestions 
were made at a meeting 
headed by Dean Manges: 
1) To have more out- 
side police with the 
university security 
officer presiding 
over themo 2) Lock- 
ing off the gates in 
the hallways so the 
whole building would 
not be open, 3) Not 
to sponsor the dances 
directly to High 
school students, I4.) 
The organic it ion 
sponsoring the dance 
would have to pay 



TTT-PTT rnT^MTmrrA^DR 



for any damage up to 

a certain amount of 

money. 

These suggestions wHl 
be looked into and scdb 
kind of policy formed 
to see that the disturb- 
ances do not occur 
again.

SEPTEMBER!!! 




Effect 



The Purdue Un ver- 
sity Board of Trustees 
Thursday (April 30) ap- 
proved self-supporting 
parking for the Indiana 
Purdue University Cam- 
pus at Fbrt Wayne. 

The nev paid parking 
program for students 
and faculty will go in- 
to effect in September* 
The Port Wayne Campus 
is the last of Purdue *s 
five campuses to come 
under a self-supporting 
program. 

The new program will 
operate under policies 
and a fee schedule a- 
dopted in June, 19 6? » 
when the Purdue North 
Central, Calumet, and 
Indianapolis campuses 
to come under a self- 
supporting parking at 
the Lafayette Campus 
has been in effect 
since 1963, 

The program at Port 
Wayne was approved by 
the Indiana University 
Board of Trustees in 
session last week in 
Blooming ton. 

The new piTOgram pro- 
vides some area for 
free parking. This 
feature was jjart of a 
five-point recommenda- 
tion of a special fac- 
ulty-student parking 
problem committee at 

the Port Wayne Campus' 
which studiea "cne cam- 
pus parking problem for 
five months. The re».^ 
ommendatlons were sub- 
mitted by Port Wayne 
Chancellor Ralph £. 



Broylesy Indiana, ana 
Dean and Director Law- 
rence 0. Nelson, Purdue 
to the universities' 
two presidents, Preder- 
ick L. Hovde and Joseph 
L* Sutton* 

Only one of the five 
recommendations— to re- 
quest state funds for 
future parking needs- 
was eliminated from the 
recommendations submit- 
ted to the two boards 
of trustees. 

The Port Wavne Cam- 
pus now has l,9ol park- 
ing spaces, but project 
tlons indicate need for 
nearly 5&gt;000 by 1980 
when the campus is ex- 
pected to enx»oll nearly 
9,500 full and part- 
time students. Like 
Purdue's other regional 
campuses, Fbrt Wayne Is 
primarily a "commuter 
campus •** 

Under the program, ' 
faculty and staff may 
obtain "A" spaces, con- 
sidered the most con- 
venient or desirable, 
at #30 per semester or 
$60 per year, and "B" 
spaces which will cost 
12.50 per semester of* 
^25 per year. Students 
taking five to eight 
credit hours and fac- 
ulty and staff employed 
less than half time may 
obtain an "A" permit at 
$15 per semester or $30 
per year, or a "B" Per- 
mit at |6.?5 per sem- 
ester or $12.50 per 
year. Students' en- 
rolled in, or staff as- 



signed to» one to four 
credit hours may elect 

to^ take the same plan 

as prevails fey rive i.o 
eight credit hours or 
they may use visitor 
parking meters on a 
day-to-d ay b asi s* 

Visitor parking ar- 
eas will be metered* 
Under university park- 
ing regulations, park- 
ing permits at the Port 
Wayne Campus are valid 
at all other Purdue 
campuses. 

The work of the spe- 
cial Port Wayne Campus 
faculty- student parking 
committee which pre- 
pared the original re- 
port to the two Port 
M&amp;jne deans won high 
praise from Dr. C, H. 
Law she, vice president 
for regional campus ad- 
ministration. 

"The final report of 
this committee is a 
classical example of 
student and faculty In- 
put into the operation 
of a university," 
Lawshe told the board. 
"We are extremely 
grateful for the many 
hours this group put in 
In the development of 
the program and Its re- 
commendations. Though 
not every recommenda- 
tion was followed, 
this program is basic- 
ally the product of 
students and faculty 
working hand- in -hand 
with the administration 
to solve an Important 
and basic problem."
