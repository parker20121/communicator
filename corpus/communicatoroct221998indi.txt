Artist Judy Chicago speaks on life's work 




Judy Chicago begins the lecture on her 
experiences in the art world, 



by MLshanna Wood 



/VVn'j Editor 

Anisi Judy Chicago shared her 
visions of birth, ihe holocausi. 
women's hislory, the power of men and 
the future of Ibe world this past 
Monday nighl in ibc Walb Ballroom 

Some of her greatesl aecomplish- 
menls are Ihe "Dinner Party." 
"Through the Flower," "Man and 
Power," and "Holocaust, from 
Darkness into Light" and "The Birth 
Project." 

Yet to come is "Resolutions, a 
siiich in Time," 

Chicago started off as a rebel in the 
early 1960s . trying 10 establish herself 
in the lx)s Angeles art world with her 
depictions of women. 

She found thai women often had to 



imitate male art. Women have the righi 
lo achieve their own artwork, said 
Chicago. 

She became bolder with "The 
Dinner Pany," her most well-known 
piece. In the piece, 39 plate; represent- 
ing women in history are set on a trian- 
gular table, which is an old symbol of 
the goddess and femininity. 

The table is engraved with the 
names of 999 women who made a sig- 
nificant contribution 10 hislory. 

The names of these women were 
simply erased or forgotten, 

Chicago wants this piece to become 
as universal as the Sistine Chapel or the 
"Last Supper" by Michelangelo. 

There are universal pieces of art- 
work by men and almost none by 
women. 

According to Chicago, if one walks 
into a major art museum, 90 to 95 per- 



cent of the works were created by men 
and only 5 percent by women. 

Chicago is trying to change all of 
this through her pieces and a goal to 
help women work out of direct 
enperience. 

She has used a wide variety of 
mediums such as fireworks, ceramics, 
stained glass windows and needlework 

'The Birth Project" was created 
between 1980-85 and consists of 80 
colorful tapestries which display and 
explain tlie pains and joys of binh. 

"Out of the chaos came a scream of 
birth, the birth of the universe." pro- 
claims Chicago's "Birth Project." 

Her depiction of men deals with the 
issues ofthe universal power that some 
men have in society and their tendency 
to withhold their feelings. 

Chicago made it clear that her art 
is not directed toward all men, but 



some men. 

Her works displayed tough faces 
that hid sorrow and other faces which 
revealed masked feelings. 

She also dealt with the attitude 
some men have who think they are con- 
querors of the world with a natural 
right lo repress others, 

Chicago's depiction of the 
Holocaust displays the pain and victim- 
ization of Jewish people. 

A multi-colored triangle represenu 
the ones the Jews wore for identifica- 
tion. 

Red flames surround the tnangle to 
represent a barbed wire wall of indif- 
ference.

Healthy Lung 
Month: 

Lose the habit and breathe 



hy Carrie Anne Leathers 

Chief Reporter 

Although October is almost over, 
(he efforts of the American Lung 
Associations (ALA) towards Healthy 
Lung Month will continue year 
round. 

Smoking continues to damage the 
health of millions of Americans every 
year, but the ALA will continue to 
urge smokers loquiL 

New on-line versions of the 
ALA's Freedom From Smoking pro- 
gram arc now available, making it 
possible for smokers lo cope with 
their habits in the security of their 
own homes. 

"The American Lung 
Association's Freedom From 
Smoking program is built on the 
premise that no two smokers are 
alike," said president of the ALA 
Donald L. Clark said. 

"Thai's why the on-line clinic 
begins by finding out why each per- 
son smokes and the specific people, 
places and things that trigger their 
urge to light up, in order to, develop 
an individual set of coping strategies 
to handle these triggers." 

The programs have been avail- 
able for a year, however the on-line 
version is more recent and those 
interested should check out the ALA 
website fore more information. 

Some important symptoms for 
smokers to waich for arc chronic 
cough, production, wheezing, and 
coughing up blood. 

Any of these symptoms could be 
an early warning sign and early treat- 
ment from a doctor can sometimes 
reverse lung disease. 

Adult smokers are not the only 
ones injured by cigarette smoking. 



Children are e'^pecially harmed 
from cigarettes and cigars (or pipes), 
whether it be second-hand smoke or 
directly from a mother lo an unborn 
baby. 

At a time when as many high 
school senior females smoke as 
males, pregnant smokers is an 
increasing problem. 

Of utmost concern for pregnant 
smokers should be that their children 
will be slower learners in school and 
may even be shorter and smaller than 
children of non-smokers. 

However, there are other more 
serious immediate health risks, as 
well. 

Birthweighi can be dangerously 
less for babies of smokers and babies 
of smokers are often born 
prematurely. 

This may cause portions of a 
baby's internal organs to be too 
underdeveloped to function without 
special equipment. Even on venlila- 
lors and in incubators, a baby is not 
guaranteed normal development. 

Also there are dangers associated 
with the birth of an underweight baby 
diat can harm the mother. 

Once a child is brought into this 
world, second-hand cigarciic smoke 
makes him or her more likely to get 
pneumonia, bronchitis, ear infections 
and develop asthma. 

Between 150.000 to 300,000 
children under 18 months of age get 
lung infections yearly as a result of 
secondhand smoke and these result in 
between 7,500 and 15,000 
hospitalizations.

Lung Month or lung health in gener-

Ed Schick speaks at a memorial service remembering Matthew 
Shepard on Sunday at Freimann Square, 



In general the ALA suggests these 10 
tips for healthy lungs. 

1, Don't smoke. 

2. II you do snru)ke. quit today Call Ihe American 'Quit Smoking Action 
Plan* 

3 Avoid second-hand smoke Smoke-filled, poorly-ventilated rooms can 
worse than smoking Request their brochure on 'Second-hand Smoke.' 

4 Consul! your doctor if you have a persistent cough, (requeni colds, 
sneezing, or il you are short ol breath after simple exercise. 

5 ir you already have a lung disorder or are over 65, ask your doctor 
about a flu or pneumonia shot. 

6 If you have been ir^ contact with someone who has tuberculosis, con- 
sult your dodor 

7 Check for lung hazards on the job and in your home-eliminate 
aerosol products, test Tor radon, check air quality, and protect yourself from 
dust and fumes 

8 Keep small objects that can be inhaled or ingested out of a child's 
reach. 

9. Some illnesses can be reduced or avoided by immuncalions 

10. Reduce air pollution. 



'Captive Free' performs 
for Campus Ministry 



by Brian Long 



IPFW's Campus Ministry program will spon- 
sor a concert featuring the Qiristian band Captive 
Free at United Methodist Church on Nov. 17 at 7 
p.m. 

The band tours all over the country performing 
in churches, schools coffee houses and prisons. 

Incorporating music, drama, puppets, and per- 
sonal sharing. Captive Free attempts to make a 
statement relevant to people of all ages. The pro- 
gram theme this year is "Won by one." 

Captive Free is the brain child of a specialised 
youth ministry program based in Minneapolis 
called youth Encounter. 

Each year they sponsor eight bands such as 
Captive Free to travel in different pans of the coun- 
try and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. They also 
sponsor two to four Band tours overseas each year. 

Campus Ministry is designed as a ministry to 
students and offers Bible studies, recreational 
events, an annual workshop over Spring Break, and 
opportunities to become involved in local and 
national service projects. 



There is also a monthly lecture series offered 
during the academic year. The forum is casual and 
is a junction of a provocative topic with a light 
lunch. 

It encourages dialogue between students, facul- 
ty, local clergy, and members of the community, 
■fhe lectures are free, and reservations are not 
necessary- 
Pastor Ben Gates is in charge of the organiza- 
tion and has been active in ministry for over 20 
years. 

In addition to his ministry, he leaches hisiory 
at IPFW. ITT and the University of St. Francis. 

He encourages students to investigate the 
teachings of Jesus Christ, and he helps them expe- 
rience the power and reality of the love of God. 

Gates is also available for pastoral counseling 
and spiritual guidance free of charge. 

There arc meetings every Monday at United 
Methodist Church at 7 p.m. College age youth from 
all over iow.ti attend and share their experiences in 
small groups. 

Campus Ministry reminds the academic com- 
munity that the secular and sacred, reason and 
faith, must be held in balance in any honest intel- 
lectual search. 



Undergrad 
receives 
research 
award 



The first Pulin Sampai Memorial 
Award for Undergraduate Research was 
presented at the IPFW Honors 
Convocation on Oct. 4, 

Pamela Bell, the winner of the award, 
is an undergraduate majonng in chemistry. 

Her research topic, Prompt and 
Delayed Electron Photoejcction from 
Triammmecopper (1) and Formation of a 
Dinuclear Excited State Complex in 
Aqueous Solution, was selected from 
applicants representing the biology, chem- 
Lstry and physics departments at IPFW. 

Bell worked with Kenneth Stevenson, 
chemistry department chair, during the 
summer of 1997, to conduct the research. 

Their work was later published in the 
Journal of American Chemical Society in 
May. 

"We worked on using ultraviolet light, 
a high-energy light, to drive chemical reac- 
tions," Bell explained. "Using light is dif- 
ferent from using heal to drive the reac- 
tions; this is a new way lo create a chemi- 
cal compound in the laboratory." 

"We were working on photochemical 
reactions ibai occur when exposed to light; 
Ihis occurs quickly, on a time-scale as long 
as one-millionth of a second." said 
Stevenson "Any photochemical reaction 
involves these fast processes. 
Photochemistry also has uses in business 
(photography), environmental studies 
{photo-conversion of energy) and medi- 
cine (dentisEry)." 

Undergraduate research is available in 
many disciplines at IPFW. 

"There are lots of opportunities to do 
undergraduate research ai this campus, 
especially in the chemLsiry department. We 
conduct research that's original, research 
that can be published in a reputable jour- 
nal, research that can be reported on at 
conferences," said Stevensoo. 

The Pulin Sampai Memorial Award 
was established to reward exceptional 
undergraduate students working in and 
exploring research. 

Pulin Sampai graduated from IPFW in 
1994 and went on to conduct graduate 
research at Brandeis University. He died 
Jan. 26, 1996 

Though applicants for this year's rep- 
resented research performed in ihe sci- 
ences, the Puhn Sampai Award is open to 
all disciplines. 

Applicauons for next year's award will 
be available in March 1999. 

Contaa Nancy Vojtash Moore at 747- 
2487.

Life at 24fps 



by Denny She -Edilorial CanoonisI 



Staff Editorial 



Topic: 

Gay hate crimes 

What we think: 

Let's do something to 
put an end to violence 
and cruelty 



rhc apparent haie-cnme rclaied di;ath 
of Wyoming college siudeni Maiihew 
Shepaid, 21, has caused boib horror and 
outrage all over America in Uie lasl two 
weeks, 

Shepard was robbed and pisiol- 
whipped afler allegedly "llirting" with two 
men at a bar in Laramie. Wyoming. 

He waii subsequently tied lo a split-rail 
fence outside Laramie in temperatures near 
freezing and left for dead. 

Discovered by someone who happened 
(o be riding a bike in the area, Shepard was 
taken to a nearby hospital but never 
regained consciousness. He died on 
Monday, OcL 12. 

Shepard's death has caused an already 
sensitive topic lo be pushed to the forefront 
of national legislation and local discussion. 

Federal hatc-ciime laws currently pro- 
tect citizens with race, color, religion or 
national origin, not sexual orientation, as 
the focus. 

Twenty-one states have hate-crime 
laws; however, Indiana is not one of those 



■States. 

In Wyoming and other states there have 
been repeated cffons lo pass hate-crime 
laws. The efforts have generally failed 
because the opposition claims that passing 
these laws gives homosexuals "'special 
rights." 

Special rights? Huh? While it's true 
that we legally protect people based on 
things beyond the scope of their control, 
such as their skin color and nationality, we 
also legally protect people based on things 
that are personal choices, such as religion. 

Regardless of whether you think that 
homosexuality is a personal choice or a 
biological fact, there is no denying that 
there is little cause to refuse the same legal 
protections to gays and lesbians that other 
groups arc accorded if the above stream of 
logic is implemented 

Shouldn't all Americans be secure in 
the knowledge that they are protected 
from violence? Or only those groups that 
people in power are comfortable with? 

Even if you Oppose homosexuality alto- 
gether, you cannot deny the fact that to 
oppose such inclusive legislation is to con- 
done violence and hatred. Is that die kind 
of world that you want lo live in? We sure 
don'L 

The beauty of this country's 
Constitution is that it gives an equal voice 
to everyone, even those who live lives that 
some individuals do not agree with. 
However, gays and lesbians have long 
been exempt from such equality. How is 
that okay? 

Yet legislation extending what are. 
essentially, equal rights to gays and les- 
bians is again and again defeated because 
some people think diat they are getting 



special rights. 

Since when are fair ireaimeni and tol- 
erance "special rights"? Don't all people 
deserve dignity? Vou needn't approve of or 
respect homosexuality lo afford others the 
dignity that all humans deserve. Matthew 
Shepard was not given any dignity in his 
last moments of life. He was a victim of 
cruelty based on his sexual 
orieni^tion. 

What happened to Matthew Shepard 
was horrifying. This country needs to get 
its act together and stop tolerating hatred 
against anyone, senual orientation notwith- 
standing. Violence against anyone is sim- 
ply wrong. 

No one wants to have a crime similar to 
what occurred in Wyoming happen in Ton 
Wayne, but it could. There is no law to dis- 
courage such an occurrence. 

We are an All-American city. Let's 
show the country what we can do to stop 
hate crimes.

Missing legends 



I can't say that I was ever a big sports fan 
like most of my friends. Sure. I'd play bas- 
ketball and football like any other kid grow- 
ing up. but most of my henxs that I had 
growing up were movie stars, musicians, 
artists, film directors, and people on 
television. 

Having heroes is a big pan of our cul- 
ture. Look at who most kids idolize today: 
Michael Jordan, Deion Sanders, Ken Griffey, 
and, most recently, Sammy Sosa and Mark 
McGwire. For some reason, I just have a 
problem with having professional athletes as 
heroes, 

I guess it is just because 1 feel that spons 
arc Just a physical challenge and not much of 
an intellectual or artLstic challenge. I do 
imderstand that there is a certain amount of 
mental strain and pressure involved in athlet- 
ics. This is piobably why I don't find sports 
too pleasing. 

Some of my heroes growing up were 
Alfred Hitchcock. Steven Spielberg, Buddy 
Rich, Glen Miller. George Lucas, 
George Bums, and Salvador Dali. All of 
these people 1 prelty much would follow 
almost religiously to extremes. 

Lately I have been following more 
actors and directors, since film is the 
field of entertainment that 1 have profes- 
sionally chosen to pursue. For the past 
five or six years I have been paying 
attention to all of the major players and 
some of the minor people. 

Like most any other person interest- 
ed in film, I looked into Tarantino and 
other directors who are ouLside of main- 
stream Hollywood. If you have ever 



talked to me about movies, you know that I 
sec at least 15 films a week. 

I'd have to say that some of the film peo- 
ple whom I appreciate most arc the filminak- 
ers who break away from the mainstream. 

nic thing I keep thinking of is how 
many people 1 would really like to know in 
Hollywood who have now passed on. Most 
of them are actors, except for Hitchcock. 

If 1 had a chance to talk to Hitchcock. 
one of the fu'st things I would ask is this: 
How did you do it? How did you become a 
great director? Then I would ask him what he 
thinks of Gus Van Sani's remake of Psycho. 
I know he's tunung over in his giavc. 

The actors that I really miss arc J.T. 
WaJsb. Lloyd Bridges, George Bums and 
Jimmy Stuart. 1 think that these are probably 
some of the greatest people to ever grace the 
silver screen. Every time that I sec a film 
with one of them in it, it makes me wonder 
what more they could have done for their an. 



'Retirement at 
sixty-five is 
ridiculous. When 
I was sixty-five I 
still had pimples" 

-George Burns 



Letter to the Editor 



I read with great interest Dennis 
Donahue's proposal thai the sttj- 
denls publish a guide to faculty, in 
order lo assist students in locating 
the gond teachers and avoiding the 
had. When I was an undergraduate 
we published such a guide every 
year, the Harvard Confi-Guide for 
short, and on the day it came out 
the faculty always bought their 
copies early to look up their own 
evaluations. 

It was more than the summary 
of student evaluations that Donahue 
proposes^it was a literate, enter- 
taining description, with brief or 
not-so-b(ief narratives about cours- 
es, what to expect in class, in 
assignments, on tests; it described 
different teachers' lecture styles and 
pedagogical philosophies. It could 
hardly be described as fair or even- 
handed, since the teachers who 
aroused the liveliest responses 
always got the most detailed write- 
ups, but it was certainly entertain- 
ing reading. 

At my first teaching position the 



students published a guide more ■■••"&lt; 
like the one that Donahue propos-i i-' 
es — a summary of evaluations. The 
evaluations were student- written, 
and participation was voluntary on 
the part of the faculty. Some factjlty 
members developed their own eval- 
uation forms. 

Either way the guide was a good 
exercise in publishing for students 
interested in a career in publishing, 
and I don't think they did the stu- 
dents any harm. Whether they did 
them any good or not, is more diffi- 
cult to say. But if there's any gen- 
uine interest in such a project I 
would be delighted to assist — it 
would have to be a studen [-generat- 
ed effort, obviously, but it would do 
no harm to have some faculty 
assistance.

What's Weak this Week 



by Dennis Donahue 
Columnist 



Mes, sports, fall, traffic, vending, voting and cMs. 



I went (o a couple of movies 
last week during break. First, I 
waiched "Saving Private Ryan,'" 
This was by far the bkwdiest wax 
movie 1 have ever seen. Ii is proba- 
bly one of the bloodiesi movies I've 
ever seen. 

Spielberg held nothing back. It 
i&gt;in'I a Tom Hanks movie either. I 
mean, he's good, but the movie 
could have been made wiihoul him. 
I liink he's in it for the box office 
draw. 

Ii was a faniastic movie. If you 
don't like blood, avoid this movie 
ai all costs. If you like history 
and/or war movies, ils a must see. 
Eat afterwards though, not before. 

The other movie I checked out 
was ai the Cinema Center down- 
town. Ii was called "Smoke 
Signals." 

This movie was one of the 
coolest I have seen in a long time. Il 
was the fixsl movie directed, pro- 
duced, and starring a mostly Native 
American cast. 

It wasn't about "'Indians" bul 
more about bow people grow up 
and survive without parents. It was 
sad at some limes, bul it made you 
laugh very hard at other times. 

If you like dialogue, Native 
American history, and beautiful 
cinematography (it was filmed in 
Idaho), rent this with your better 
half You will love thLs movie. Ii 
makes you appreciate movie mak- 
ing just thai much more, Tmie lo 
nunbleon... 

Can you believe thai we are 



half way done with the semester 
already? This semesler is jusi flying 
by. At least the weather has been 
reasonably nice. 

I remember last year the weath- 
er was just as awesome, (prc-El 
Nino). Hopefully, ii will stay cool 
till about April. I miss snow and all, 
bul I'm just not ready for iL 

I noticed ihat the mosquitoes 
and yellow jackets were terrible 
this year. Have we even had a frost 
yet? I think fall is ihc greatest time 
of the year. It's football, raking 
leaves, Halloween, bonfires, and 
hot apple cider. 

1 don'i have much lo complain 
about this week. My Dad is coming 
up from Rorida for the Notre Dame 
game this weekend; we should have 
an cxa;llcni time. I haven't seen 
him since May. 

The Irish look better ihis year 
bul I still think they need work. The 
Yankees look like Ihey have il 
locked up this year. By the way, 
there sure is a lot of new Yankee 
merchandise on campus this year. 

I know everybody loves a win- 
ner, but come on guys. How 'boui 
those Boilers? The Oaken Bucket 
game looks like a loss up this year. 
Go Hoosiers, I guess. 1 just want 
basketball season to start. 

Has anybody else noticed ihc 
traffic in Fort Wayne has gotten 
worse? 

Is the turn signal optional? Are 
speed limit signs but mere sugges- 
titMis? Even some of the cops drive 
fast; nice example officers. How is 



it that parents let their children gel 
away with such obnoxious driving? 

Kids today are extremely 
spoiled. Did your parents buy you a 
nice car, or something just lo get 
around in? I think I've noticed that 
Ihe more expensive the car, the 
worse the driver. Just a theory. 

I think I'm getting pretty sick of 
paying a buck for a 20 oz. Pepsi. In 
fact all of Ihe food and snacks on 
this campus are a rip-off. One 
would think thai the prices would 
be lower as we are just poor college 
students. 

I really feel like we should 
boycott the vending companies 
imtil they reduce the prices, maybe 
the school is jusi being greedy, I 
don't know the whole sioty, but I'm 
nol paying for another pop again, 
I'm going lo stari bringing my own. 
It will also reduce waste, and lhat is 
a good thing. 

Is everyone registered lo vote? 
It's loo late by now. You really miss 
Ihe boat when you choose nol lo 
vole. Other countries in Ihe world 
force you to vote, or won't even let 
you. 

In the United States, you have 
Ihe choice to decide who makes 
Ihe public policy in the areas you 
live in. yet less than 40 percent of 
Ihe voting public participates. That 
is some uliimaie weakness. 

You want a skateboard park? 
Beiler council-members? Safer 
sireeis? Lobby, organize, and vote, 
don't sil back and whine. Being a 
slacker will nol accomplish goals. 



You really should vote; it is a 
responsibility and a privilege. If 
you don'l vole, don't complain, it's 
thai simple. 

Also, don't give me Ihe "my 
vote doesn't couni" bit cither, if you 
really believe that, than YOU don'l 
count. 

Let's see. what else is bugging 
me in my hlUe world. Movies, 
sports, fall, traffic, vending, voUng, 
there was something else. 

Oh yeah, could the clocks on 
campus all possibly be set on the 
SAME time? What gives? If il 
doesn't work, fix it or replace il. 
Where exacUy does our tuition go? 

Shouldn't the buildings reflect 
the standard of education? Trivial 
as it may seem, time is very impor- 
tant to siudents. And that's the other 
thing I forgot to mention tasi week. 

Professors should respecl Ihe 
fact thai we might have a class in 
the next ten lo fifteen minutes. Slop 
going over. How would you feel if 
all of US came in late for every 
period? 



Check your watch with time 
and temperature and reset il if you 
have to. but pay attention to what's 
going on. we have places to be loo. | 

Well, that does it for this week. 
I hope everyone is settling in. Next 
week is the last week to drop. t&gt;on't 
get an "F": it isn't worth iL Drop it 
now and just take it again. Trust 
me. 

Loser of the Wcck-The 'hate- 
crime' buzz. Maybe Mallhcw 
Shepard was killed as just another 
act of violence by a bunch of stupid 
hicks. 

If you kill someone, you proba- 
bly hate them, right? I think the gay 
conmiuniiy is crying "Wolf a little 
too early in Ihis case. 

This Ls the way the media is 
manipulating the public against 
each other. I really hope he wasn't 
killed just because he was gay. 

But I think we beiier wail for 
the facts, Ihcn repori on them. Be 
nice, have a great weekend.

Forever Friends, Pan 3: Drea/T\5 



by Adam Taylor 



Features Editor 

TVcnty years had passed since 
ihe passing of Bob's cbildhood 
friend Luke and yei he siill couldn't 
Slop dreaming aboui him. 

Bob would wake up in the mid- 
dle of the night swcaiing profusely, 
dreaming of limes be and his friend 
Luke had shared in ihcir short exis- 
lence together, and it was beginning 
lo bother him. 

He had gone lo a psychiatrist 
over bis dilcTtima, but no one had lo 
[ell him he had a hard lime Idling 
goof the past. 

That was evident in his dreams. 

Bob's problems with sleep 
bothered his wife Melissa as much 
as it did Bob. 

She bad known both Luke and 
Bob at the lime of Luke's death and 
was even dating Luke before ibe 
siomacb cancer look him to an 
early grave. 

She stili felt as though she'd 
never be able lo understand this 
morbid infaiuaiion Boh seemed lo 
slill have wiUi his long since 
departed friend. 

What was more, she didn'i 
know what she could do about iL 

She'd try holding him, telUng 
him it was all just a dream and thai 
be shouldn't lei it get to htm, but 
he'd only respond with a distant 
look that signified he wasn't listen- 
ing inside. 

She tried her best to comfon 
bun otherwise by diminishing some 
of his workload at home, even by 
lalking him into taking a week's 
vacation to get away from work, 
but it was all to no avail. 

It was thus in frustration that 
she found herself imdemeath the 
tree by the fog-enshrouded lake in 
her backyard, searching for a way 
10 ease Bob's pain on the 20lb 
anniversary of bis friend's death. 

She bad loved Bob since the day 
tiiey first ki.ssed in bis backyard. 
They were boib only 16 then, but 
she knew in her heart that they 
would always be logelber. 

They both graduated with hon- 
ors from high school and both got 
in at tJie local siaie college, refusing 
to leave each other's side even for 
four years. 

Bob ended up graduating with a 
degree in engineering while she 
graduated with a degree in English 
literature. 

She got a job as a high school 
English teacher not far from where 
they both grew up where Bob had 
promised her they would live when 
ihcy were financially stable enough 
to get married. 

The love between her and Bob 
never wavered throughout college, 
growing stronger through their per- 
sonal experiences, until one day 
they finally got married. 

The wedding was simply beauti- 



ful. Both of their families showed 
up, as did their friends, and every- 
one had a fabulous time. Luke's 
mother, whom Bob bad known 
since he first entered the world, 
even came and highlighted the 
evening by dancing with Bob at the 
wedding reception. 

The honeymoon followed 
shortly after with a trip lo France; 
before she knew it. Melissa was a 
mother 

They named their son Luke so 
as not 10 forget the person responsi- 
ble for [heir being together. 

They owed Luke everything 
they bad, even though be was just a 
boy when he met with his destiny. 

They were all just children 
when Luke passed on but he gave 
them something that no one in the 
world could have ever afforded to 
— each other. 

More children would come with- 
in the few short years after their 
firsi was bom and everything had 
seemed to be going well. 

Bob would have occasional 
dreams about his childhood that 
would seem to coincide with days 
he spent with the kids, although the 
subject matter of the dreams would 
remain rather pleasant and would- 
n't really bother him. 

Lately, however, the dreams 
had become darker and more mor- 
bid and would center upon the 
months prior to Luke's death when 
his health was on the decline. 

The night before, he told 
Melissa he'd dreamed of Luke 
watching him and his children play 
baseball in the backyard. 

This gave Melissa chills, as 
she'd always felt Luke was still part 
o( their life, watching over them. It 
was hard to imagine what would 
come next. 

As she reflected on Bob's 
dream from the previous nigbi. the 
wind began to pick up and die fog 
that had accumulated around the 
lake gave way to the figure of a per- 
son approaching Melissa from the 
other side of the water. 

Walking slowly in the chilly 
evening, the person was holding his 
siomacb as if in pain and glided 
across die ground as if it were air. 

Upon die further advance of the 
figure, Melissa's bean nearly 
stopped in her chest as she began lo 
make out the face of die person. 
She was staring at the figure of her 
dead friend Luke. 

As Luke approached Melissa, 
Melissa's fears quickly dissipated. 
Luke had a caring smile on his face, 
just as she'd remembered him, and 
seemed to be glad to see her 

Forgetting for a moment dial 
Luke had died years ago, she ran 
over to him and embraced him. 

Thousands of questions became 
one large cluster as she took her 
arms from around his body and 
stepped back to look him over. 

He hadn't changed one bit from 



her childhood memories. "Luke, is 
that really you?" she asked the boy 
with wMider in her voice. 

"Ves, Melissa," the boy replied, 
"it's really me." 

Melissa cried when she heard the 
voice from ih. boy answer her 
question, to which Luke responded 
with a quick embrace. 

It had been so long since she 
had heard his voice, and bearing it 
again reminded her of happier, 
younger days when dicy all thought 
they were going to live forever. 

Tunc breached itself for her and 
she was a little girl again, innocent 
to the pain of ihe worid, "Ob my 
God. Luke, it's so good lo see you 
again." she said with a smile, ceas- 
ing her tears and wiping her eyes. 

"It's good to see you, too, 
Mehssa. It's been far too long." 

"I know it has. So much has 
changed, Luke," 

"i know il. Melissa. I've been 
watching over all of you," the boy 
replied with a lost look on his face, 
"li's good to sec you all have 
moved on." 

"It all would've been better with 
you as a pan of it, Luke." As 
Mehssa said this, she noticed the 
difference in Luke's appearance. 

He looked content, yet distant. 
His feet moved back and forth and 
be wouldn't look her straight in the 
eyes. 

Adding everything together, die 
difference was too much for 
MeUssa to undergo widiout further 
inquiry. "There's somediing wrong, 
isn't there? There's a reason why 
you're here," she trailed off. not 
sure she wanted to hear bis 
response. 

"I'll be honest with you, as you 
were a dear friend to me in life and 
you deserve nodiing less. Thae is 
something wrong, and you likely 
won't wish to hear about it if you 
knew die nature of it. With respect 
for your well-being. I'll omit the 
details in regards to my visit and 
tell you instead that Bob and I have 
always had the understanding that 
we would always be logeiher." 

"Yes, 1 know that. I know neither 
of you would do anydiing without 
the other, and if you did, it would 
kill bodi of you inside. But whai 
does dial have lo do with now? 
Why did you come here to tell me 
that now, Luke? What is so impor- 
lani about right now?" Melis,sa said, 
growing more frantic wiUi every 
word. "What is it dial you aren't 
telling me?" 

"Bob will recognize me when 
next we meet, though he will not 
recognize me as a friend. Bob will 
be screaming when I come for 
him." 

As Melissa heard these words 
uttered from the shadow of her 
fnend, her bean sunk siraigbl to her 
stomach, 

A fceUng of panic embraced 
her as she saw Luke grab his stom- 



ach with a look of pain and slowly 
walk away. 

She tried to walk after him, but 
her legs ceased to move. In die mid- 
dle of what seemed like an eternity, 
she heard Bob's voice calling to 
her 

"Melissa? Melissa, wake up! 
You're having a nigbimare." 

Melissa lurched forward from 
her sleep and, looking around, real- 
ized she was back in her room widi 
Bob. 

Bob pnampdy asked her what 
she was dreaming about as though 
diere was something he could do to 
keep it from happening again. 

In an effort to save Bob from 
heartache, she neglected to tell him 
the nature of her dream and 
resolved thai bis a.sking was just his 
way of showing concern for the 
woman he loved 

Rolling over to go to sleep, she 
convinced herself it was all just a 
dream and thai there was nothing to 
worry about. 

With an exhausting yawn, she 
quickly fell back asleep. 



Wdcomt to tfie Tempfe of Luna(cy) 



Staff Writer 

Here I am once again, with 
some Halloween sites for you. 

This tmne 1 tried to focus more 
on mythological aeatures such as 
the werewolf, witches, eic. 

And like last time, die authors 
of some ihese sites genuinely 
believe in what they write abouL 

It's a dream for a "web site 
heckler" such as myself. 

Despite all witches and were- 
wolves who may be reading, 1 will 
say bluntly that the subjects of 
some of ihcse sites are complete 
crap — that's why I write about 

h ltp://www.rscreatlonsxoin/wert 
wolE/mylhs.hlml 

This site doesn't claim ihat any 
of these myths are uiie, and thai's a 
good diing. 

It has a section tided "You 
might be a werewolf if..." you meet 
the following criteria; 

1. If you have tasted human fiesh 

2. If you have eaten the brain of a 
werewolf 

3. If you have eaien roasted wolf 
flesh 

4. If you were bom on Chrisimas 
Eve 

Now I don'i know about you. 
but I got nailed on the second pomt 
there. 

Also, some signs in recognizing 
if someone else might be a were- 
wolf are tattoos of a crescent moon 



and palms with razor stubble. 

Is Richard Simmons a were- 
wolf? 

http.7/www.cog.Drg/wJcca/raq.ht 
ml 

As opposed to the last site, ibis 
site does claim dial die "facts" list- 
ed are tnie. 

So just what 15 diis site? Well, 
suppose you were having some 
problems in general. 

If you were an ordinary person, 
you could just ask your friends, 
neighbors, strangers, and as a last 
reson, your family. 

If you were a witch however, it 
wouldn't be quite so easy. 

Widi that in mind, die designer 
of this page made a "frequendy 
asked questioas" secdon where all 
of your witch questions could be 
answered, such as why they spell 
magic "magick." (My dieory is 
because all witches failed spelling 
in grade school.) 

It also informs me that witches 
are aaually people of die earth per- 
forming natural magic 

First of all. I have my doubts, 
meaning by that this person needs a 
CAT scan. 

Secondly, who cares about 
■plural" magic? I want to see 
someone make the Sears Tower dis- 
^pear, or give me free cable for a 
year. 

As far as visiting this site goes, 
don't bother unless you're really 
into this kind of stuff, or if you just 
want something to make fun of. 

http://www.ds.djal.plpcK/shuck 

This site is about die "Shuck" 



of the southeast comer of England. 

The legend says that the 
"Shuck" is a large dog the size of a 
calf with blazing red eyes, some- 
times widi one large eye in the mid- 
dle of its forehead. 

On bad days, it says, it'll have 
fire dripping from its moudi. 

I think I've seen it before. 

During the summer, when I 
used to run in the mornings, I 
would fmd myself being chased by 
some huge dog that looked at me as 
if I was going to be lU chew toy for 
the morning. 

I don't recall one eye in the 
forehead or fire dripping from iis 
moudi, but if I did ever come across 
one of these dogs one day, 1 would- 
n't be surprised 

http : //ww w.so und.net/-mutant 

This site is dded "The Temple 
of Luna." It was written by some 
"lunatic" who believes die moon 
should be wonhiped, or somediing 
to diat exient. 

You can even see what phase 
the moon is on a particular night. 

I guess the author doesn't know 
that we've landed on die moon 
about a "zillion" times and found 
the same thing each and every time 
it's jusi one big rock circling die 
earth. 

Next week, I'll be fmisbing up 
my Halloween series. 

I think I'll shoot for more plau- 
sible sites, as I feel I've done too 
much heckling, (People who really 
know me will be laughing at die 
dioughi of diat.)

for the final installment

Lauren 
Hill, 

'Miseducated' 



by BrUn Long 



Staff Writer 

Lauren Hill's debut solo album | 
■'The Miscducaiion of Lauren Hill" 
has been at ihc lop of (be BillboaiiJ for I 
Ihe pasl two wtxis. and with her super I 
soul sound she promises lo be ihcrc I 
for a while. 

The album is full of innovative 
and fresh pop and soul ideas and has a I 
lot to offer a somewhat stagnant I 
scene. 

She is prized as a great rapper, but I 
with a thick sassy voice she also I 
exhibits an cucepUonal talent for I 
singing. 

Most of ttie tracks arc remarkably I 
tame compared to her work with the I 
Fugees. The message, however, is still I 
very strong. She uses a sort of family I 
values approach to writing ber songs I 
ihat is really refreshing. 

She's not "all about 
Benjamins," nor does she emphasi7.e I 
expensive cars or gaudy gold jewelry. [ 
She's about being real, really real, and | 
being true to what you believe. 

Lauren had her first child last year I 
and devoted a crack to him on the I 
album called "To Zion " The track I 
features none other than guitar guru I 
Carlos Santnna. 

Tlie song Ls about her battle with I 
the idea of having an abortion and I 
choosing her heart over her head. 

Tie whole album shares this very I 
intfospective and personal nature and B 
is a much needed representation of [ 
, someone with something to say. She I 
aUo produced Aretha Franklin's best I 
single in years. "A Rose is Still a \ 
Rose," 

Lauren is dcfmitely proving to be { 
a real pro in the studio. I'd like to see [ 
her do some moic producing in the I 
next few years. 

Though the album is not incredi- 
bly homogenous, it is easy to sit down I 
and listen to the whole thing in one | 
sitting. It I had to describe the whole [ 
qlbum in one word, it would be "hope- 
ful.- 

' TheV4ri:"no shiibV 'feVh'iiJi ^lleit'6"| 
images and no self- proclaiming rap- 
ping prowess — just good music and 
hard-hitting soul-felt lyrics.

Save Money: 

Fill out /our Financial Aid Forms in Advance

story by Carrie Anne Leathers 

Chief Reponer 

DIjstrallon by Denny She 

Editor iai Cartoomsi 



Ai a lime when funding college 
is becoming incrcasingty difTiculi. 
students must utilize all resources. 

Although college is doi fully 
paid very often, there are still 
options to make the cost less and the 
loans less obtrusive. 

Director of Financial Aid 
Services Robert M. Zellcrs advises 



students to fill 
out the Free 
Application for 
Financial Aid 
(FAFSA) on time 
or as early as pos- 
sible. 

"That 
will meet the 
states' deadlines 
for state grants 
and for a federal 
grant as well." 
Zellcrs said. 

Until a 

student's FAFSA 

has been lumed 

in and calculated 

by a federal 

processor, the 

university will 

not even sec iL 

Therefore, the 

sooner it is processed and sent to the 

university, the sooner the university 

can also examine a student's need 

for funding (tbai the college might 

be able to also help provide). 

'Timeliness can affect the kind 
and amount of aid ihal a &gt;;ludent can 
receive," Zellers said, "It puLs them 



in priority ordering." 

Besides turning in the FAFSA 
on lime, students are warned to lake 
every precaution to be complcicly 
accurate throughout the form. 

Mistakes greatly change the 
speed with which a FAFSA is 
processed. 

'The application goes lo a feder- 
al processor and if there is missing 
info, the federal processor will not 
calculaie the student's need (for 
financial aid)." Zellers said. "Errors 
can be corrected, hut it slows the 
process down," 

Zellers also warns students 
against esUmaling on the FAFSA-it 
is imponani lo be accurate and com-

Did you know the average family is 5110,000 in 
debt and up to eighty percent of their earnings goes 
toward debt payments? 

Yikes! How do they survive? Most likely they 
have loans, mongages and credit cards. 

Guess what, you can get rid of your credit cards, 
car and house pay- 
ments in up to three 
years. 

Impossible, you

Dave Luethold 
from ihe Debt Free 
Living Company 
will be conducting a 
tliree-houi seminar 
on Tuesday, Nov. 3, 
in Room G69 of the 
new Science 
Building M)m 6:30 
to 9:30 p.m. 

The cosi'is S40 
and pre -registration 
is available through 
Continuing 
Education at 4SI- 
6619 

"I know a man 
who has paid off his 
5100,000 house in 
three years." 
Barbara Osirowski, 
Continuing 
Education program 
coordinator said. 

Using linear 
math and crucial 
path technology, all 
debts can be elimi- 
nated allowing a 
person to function 
nonnally on cash alone. 

This means don't even think about piddng up a 
second Job or not going out on the weekends anymore. 
It's all in iheplan. 




"People can save over 5100,000 in interest pay- 
ments. They can use ihe money for themselves. This 
program is practical and down to earth," Luethold said. 
Whai you need lo do is bring in a list of your debts 
with balances and monthly payments (principal and 
interest for the mortgage). 

And, don't forget your calculators! These items 
are necessary in order for your debt -elimination plan to 
go into effect immediately. 

A reconunendcd reading to assist you with your 
new way of life, "Debt-Free and Prosperous' Living." 
can be bought at Follett's books tore located in ibe base- 
ment of Keiller Hall. 

Luethold and his parmer Phil Nace know their 
information. They arc 
both certified seminar 
leaders, 

Nace has traveled 
throughout the nation as a 
business consultant and is 
a co-founder of Debt Free 
Seminars Inc. 

Luethold has a 
B.S. in accounting from 
Penn State, 

He has served on 
the president's staff in 
Washington D.C. as 
senior executive special- 
ist in financial and 
administrative matters. 

The partners leach 
this class lo over 100 
workshops in the eastern 
pan of the United States. 
Not only do they teach at 
colleges and universities 
but at major companies as 
well. 

This is not a "gel 
rich quick scheme," 

This is a ctas.s, my 
friends, for education 
only. So please eliminate 
your premonitions along 
with your bills. It will be 
much less stres^sful in the 
long run 

This doesn'icome 
easy. You must work 
hard, you must believe 
and you cannot quiL 

If you can keep up those three things than you can 
get out of debt! 



"The FAFSA applies students 
for all federal financial aid programs 
and esiablLshes campus work study 
eligibility," Zellers said. "Without it, 
you can't get a loan." 

If students have any questions 
about the form, the stall in financial 
aid services welcomes questions and 
also advises students to check with 
financial aid rather than relying on a 
any rumors going about campus. 

"We'll try to answer any ques- 
tions," Zellets said. "If we can 
avoid confusion early on, we won't 
have students coming in on the first 
day of school asking where their 
money is." 

Students are aware, however, 
that fmancial aid often cannot pro- 
vide surTicieni funding for college- 
There are other options worth look- 
ing into. 

There are scholarships on the 
internet that are not for substantia] 
amounts of money they may still be 
of some help. 

Zellers also warns students 
against paying money for a scholar- 
ship search to be done.

1998 World Series, Padres vs. Yankees? a.k.a. David vs. Goliath? 

World Series to put the exclamation point on this year's unforgettable 
baseball spectacular plus an in depth look at the toughest job in sports 



Staff Wnier 

TTk New York Yankees aie well 
on ihcir way lo another title. While 
fans warned lo see the marquee 
matchup bciween the Braves and the 
Yanks, the San Diego Padres had 
other plans. 

Game 1 in New York was a 
slugfesL 

The Yankees erased a ihree-nin 
deficit in the 7th behind a Chuck 
Knoblacb ihree-rTin homer. 

Later in the same inning, Tmo 
Martinez hil a grand slam, which 
proved 10 be the difference, as the 
Yankees held on 9-6. 

The Yankees put Game 2 out of 
reach early. 

Slarler Andy Ashby walked 
Knoblacb to start Ihc game, who 
then stole second and then scored on 
a Ken Caminili error. 

This opened the floodgates for 
Uie Yankees who collected sixteen 
hits and scored nine runs to the 
Padres three. 

The Yankees are the epitome of 
balance. Every starter bad a hit in 
the victory. 

From lop to bottom there are no 
weak links, including their pitching 
staff. 

The Series now heads lo 
San Diego with the Yankees in com- 
plete control. 

The Pinstripes would like to 
close it out in San Diego, but look or 
the Padres to regroup and send the 
Series back lo the Bronx, where the 
Yankees will clinch it in front of 
their fans for a storybook ending to 
a fantasy season. 

Major League , Baseball has 
overshadowed football for most of 
\hefalP"' '*""■'■ '^'' 



With die World Series ending 
and the NBA not starting, that leaves 
football as the main entree on the 
spons menu. 

Sorry bockey fans, but similar to 
Ibe NBA. the regular season is much 
100 long, and much too meaningless, 
I've mentioned before how the 
NFL is defined by parity, especially 
this season. 

Rather Ihan parity, 1 think medi- 
ocrity is (he case. Free agency and 
die salary cap prevent teams from 
developing continuity over a num- 
ber of years. 

As a result there are no great 
teams, but die same handful of good 
teanns are at the top nearly every 
year 

The NFL is the only sport, 
where one individual is so responsi- 
ble for Ihe team's success — the 
quarterback. 

There is no position even com- 
parable in team spons. 

No position receives the amount 
of praise for a victory, or blame for a 
loss as the quarterback does. 

Many teams have instability at 
QB. Carolina, Washington and 
Philadelphia are all without a con- 
sistent starter. 

Not only do the pathetic teams 
have problems at QB, but the best 
teams do as well. Minnesota. Dallas, 
Kansas City, and the Super Bowl 
champion Denver Broncos all have 
lost dieir quarterbacks to injury for 
at least two games this season, hut 
their replacements have perfonned 
as well or better. 

These teams have the luxury of 
two good quarterbacks, while most 
teams would be happy to simply 
have one. 

Much has been made of die lack 
of quarterbacks in the NFL this sea- 
son, iiidrigitftjny &amp;d! "■" 



Due 10 either injury or poor per- 
formance by the starter, more than 
half of the league's diirtyteanLS have 
used more dian one quarterback for 
a substantial amount of lime this 
season. 

Names like Donald Hollas, 
Trent Green, Jason Garrelt. and Eric 
Zeier head Ihe list of unknowns who 
have started for their respective 
teams diis season. 
The general 
consensus is that 
there are not 
enough good 
quarterbacks 
around, but iberc 
are many, many 
factors that 
determine a 
quarterback's 
fate other than 
pure physical tal- 
ent 

A quarter- 
back must be an 
extension of the 
coach on the 
field, knowing 
what every play- 
er's assignment 
is on every play 

To be suc- 
cessful they also 
have 10 be in a 
system that com- 
plements their 
strengths with 
players around 
them who can 
make plays when given the chance. 
Jeff George has one of the 
strongest, most accurate arms in the 
NFL, but widiout a consistent run- 
ning game to keep die defense hon- 
est, he has been an average NFL 
quarterback. 
1 1 With defenses getting bigger 



and stronger die NFL quarterback 
job as become die toughest job in all 
of sports. 

Great college quanerhacks like 
Charlie Ward. Rick Mirer, Gino 
Toretia. Andrc Ware and Tommy 
Frazier have never made the transi- 
tion to die pro game. All of diose 
guys had die physical ability to play, 
but were given up on, pressed into 
action loo early, or never given a 



game. 

Detroit rookie quarterback 
Charlie Batch who was not Uirown 
to die wolves tike his peers, replaced 
Mitchell and has outplayed both 
Manning and Leaf. 

Joe Montana is widely consid- 
ered die best quarterback in Uie his- 
tory of die NFL. 

He did not have die strongest 
arm, or quickest feet, but he did 




chance. 

Scott Mitchell and Jeff Blake 
are maJcing millions of dollars ihLs 
year to hold a clipboard, because 
coaches have given up on diem. 
Meanwhile rookies Ryan Leaf and 
Peyton Manning, starters since draft 
day. are struggling to grasp the pro 



have many things around him to 
help him achieve all of his success. 

First, Montana was drafted in 
die third round, and not expected to 
make an impact right away. He had 
a chance to ease into the position 
and learn. 

Second, Montana had die good 



fortune to learn under die tutelage of 
one of die grcaicsi minds in football 
history— Bill Walsh. Walsh is 
known as die fadicr of die West 
coast offense, which spreads die ball 
around the field using all of die 
offensive weapons, and prevents 
defenses from keying on one indi- 
vidual. 

Montana's greatest attributes were 
his intelligence, poise and leader- 
ship, but he also had die good for- 
tune to be te&lt;uned with other great 
playen like Jerry Rice, Roger Craig, 
Tom Radiman, Brent Jones and John 
Taylor. 

This was also in the era before 
unrestricted free agency and the 
salary cap. 

As a result, the 49ers were able 
to keep dieir teams intact, even after 
championships, which is unheard of 
today. 

The Montana example illus- 
trates dial in order to be successful. 
a quarterback needs a number of 
factors to work in his favor. 

He bas lo be with die right team, 
in a system dial cooiplemenls his 
abiliues, at the right time widi the 
right coaches and talented team- 
mates, white not getting injured. 

You can see how liming and 
luck are as important as talent and 
intelligence. 

Even if you have all of the nec- 
essary component, you still need a 
good defense, so thai you don't have 
to constantly oulscoie opponents. 

In real estate, il is location, loca- 
tion, location In comedy, timing is 
everyUiing. For an NFL quarterback 
it is essential to have all of die qual- 
ilies: location, timing, luck, ability, 
inictligence, perseverance, and dedi- 
cation.

Womens tennis wraps up another successful season 

Dynamic Duo of Becky Bermes and Laura Fisher lead tennis team to 
third place finish in conference tournament 



Sports EJiior 

The Womens lermis icam rinished ils 
season Lhis past week, placing tbird in the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference, 

Tbc lean) gave an oulsianding efTon, bui 
fell shon lo number one seed Kentucky 
Wcsleyan, placing ihem in ihc Consolation 
Game. 

Tlie leam, which was ranked fourth in 
the louxnament, upsei number three seed 
Souihera Illinois Universiiy-Edwardsville lo 
give [hem their third-place ranking. 

The loumament signified what IPFW 
lennis is all aboui; team unity and team 
depth. 

Great games came from all six players. 



However, it was Ihe 
play of senior Becky 
Bermes which made 
this tournament so 
great. 

Bcnnes. a senior, 
has been the heart and 
soul of this team. 

"Becky played 
great for us," Coach 
Horion said, '"Every 
match she comes too 
play and ihat was con- 
tagious for this team." 

Bermes was 

rewarded for her efforts 

this past week when the 

GLVC awarded iL"; All -Conference awards. 

Dermes. along with leammaie Laura 




Becky 
Bermes 



Season Highlights 



O 

o 
o 

o 



Detealed an undefeated Edwardsville team in regular season and again 
beating them in the GLVC lournameni. 



First round victory against Southern Indiana. 



Christina Rape's Golden Set: 84 straight points. 



Finished 3fd in the GLVC, 18-5 overall record (8-2 in conference). 



I-istier. were Ixiih unanimous selections to 
be awarded the honor 

For Bermes it was just one of many post 
season awards but without a doubt probably 
one of her most meaningful. 

For Fisher, it was her first of many to 
come. Fisher, a sophomore from Bellmoni 
High School, will have many more magical 
moments in her career. 

However, for Bermes, her career has 
come to an end and 1 don't think she could 
have a.'Oced for a better storybook ending. 
Bermes went 16-4-1 in singles play this sea- 
son and went 8-4 with April Hatch as her 
doubles partner 

However Bermes and Fisher will 
be the first to admit that the prime reason 
ihey have had so much success this season 
was because of their depth. 

Dawn Caryer who has played number 
one singles most of die year is only a 
sophomore. She had a very successful 



season at die toughest spot in the spon. 

Caryer compiled a 11-10 record over the 
course of the year and was a key member to 
this year's squad. She will be called upon lo 
fill Ihe shoes left by Betmes. 

Also a sophomore, Jeima Hamieyer 
will be a huge bright spot for next year's 
leam. Hanneyer compiled a 9-10-2 record 
this season and 4-5 in doubles play. 

ChnsLna Pape played great this season 
for the Dons. She compiled a 17-1-2 record 
but more importantly knows and docs what 
it lakes to win. 

Mehssa George also provided another 
aspect of depth. George will be called upon 
to step up and again play a viial rote. 
George was 13-4-2 in singles play and 99-9 
in doubles action this season. 

As fw April Hatch, only lennis is done 
and she will now start concenlialing on 
basketball. 

Hatch provided some needed inspiration 



and depdi lo the leam. 
She played really well 
for her first year. c*im- 
piling a 8-4 doubles 
record. 

The team will 
have a lot lo look for- 
ward to for next .sea- 
son, but for this season 
it will be remembered 
as "Becky Bermes 
season." 

'"She was very 
good and very insiru- 
mental in all of our 
games ibis season and 

1 would hale to think 

where we would be widiout her," Coach 
Honon said. "As for the future of IPFW 
lennis. I think it looks bright: if the girls pul 
in the lime they need lo this spring, we will 
l&gt;C very good."
