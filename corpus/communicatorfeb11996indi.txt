IPFW enrollment drops. ..again 



by Nol Jleckley 

Editor 

Spring enrollment declined four 
percent from last year and contin- 
ued B trend of small declines from 
I'n ■• 1' ■■■■ years, according (o figures 
released by Jack Dahl, associate 
vice chancellor and registrar 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Prank Borelli said in a 
statement the university is aggres- 
sively pursuing prospective stu- 
dents with an strategic advertising 
campaign on radio, television and 
area newspapers. 

"We no longer can expect stu- 
dents to come to II*1 : W simply 
because we are here; we should not 
assume that students understand (he 
value of higher education," Borelli 
said in his statement. 

Part-time enrollment has also 
declined according to Dahl's fig- 
ures, Chancellor Michael Warlell 



attributed this 
decline to a 
strong region- 
al economy. 

The decline 
in enrollment 
has nol affect- 
ed the depart- 
ments of com- 
puter science, 
dental educa- 
tion, educa- 
tion and gen- 
eral studies, 
according to 
Dahl's fig- 
ures. Minority 

enrollment fluctuated little since 
last year's record level Students 
commuting from outside Allen 
County increased to 28 percent of 
total enrollment 

IPFW's decline can be attrib- 
uted to five factors according to 
Borelli's statement 




•a decline in the number of high 
school graduates in Allen County 
from 3.991 graduates in 1988 to 
only 3.310 in 1995 

•a strong economy that is pro- 
viding more jobs and overtime 
which students are taking advan- 
tage of instead of education 

•more higher education opportu- 



nities in the 
Fort Wayne 
area, particular- 
ly for the older, 
part-time stu- 
dent, thereby 
creating a com- 
petition for stu- 
dents which did 
nol exist sever- 
al years ago 

• a 

decline in the 
value of higher 
education 
among those 
who take a 
short-term view of their economic 
well-being 

•changes in students' personal 
and family circumstances 

"We have to do a better job in 
positioning IPFW within the area 
higher education community; pro- 
moting the value of a degree from 



1U or Purdue," Borelli said, 

The Admissions office is 
expanding its recruiting efforts to 
include high school visits and 
senior exit interviews, direct mail- 
ings, campus lours and IPFW 
departments, according to Borelli's 
statement. 

Borelli's statement also said 
every 1U campus' enrollment 
decreased except 1UPUI and IU 
East in Richmond. IU Kokomo's 
enrollment dropped 8 6 percent and 
4 6 percent at IU NorthwesL 

His statement also mentioned 
the new child care center as an 
important promotional initiative. In 
addition, IPFW alumni and Fort 
Wayne Community Schools have 
been solicited to assist in recruiting 
new students. 

Borelli also said the university 
must meet student needs concern- 
ing advising and course scheduling.

Broken elevator causes few problems 




by Travis Stahl 
Staff Reporter 

The elevator in Walb has been 
out of service since the beginning 
of this semester due to a fluid leak 
in the elevator's hydraulic cylinder 

The leak has caused a loss of 
hydraulic pressure, which creates 
the power necessary to raise and 
lower the elevator completely 

The project is on schedule 
according to Don Karter. director of 
the physical plant heading up the 
repair operation If the damage to 
the cylinder liner is too severe, the 
lift will have to be disassembled, he 



This could cause flooding, as 
the campus is so close to the St. 
Joseph River, according to Katter. 

In addition, because Katter said 
he is unsure about the cause of the 
problem, there is at present no way 
of knowing what steps could be 
taken to prevent a similar break- 
down. 

The elevator must be hoisted to 
the top of the shaft, allowing main- 
tenance engineers to enter at the 
bottom in order to repair the dam- 
aged liner in the hydraulic system. 
However, the repairs cannot take 
place until the new liner arrives. 
According to Katter. this could take 
several weeks In order to assure 
against future teaks and fit (be 
cylinder perfectly, the liner has to 
be machined to precision. 

"Without the use of the elevator 
the employees now have to wheel 
large packages for classes on dol- 
lies to the back of Walb and use the 
service elevator." said Tammy 
Southern, registration secretary for 
Continuing Education, which is 
located at the top of the staircase in 
Walb While some people do not 
object to taking the stairs, others 
who have had to make use of the 
Continuing Education office nave 
expressed discomfort in climbing 



the stairs, according to Souther 

Advisers at Disabled Students 
Services have been directing stu- 
dents who are unable to use the 
stairs to the service elevator located 
on the north side of Walb. 

"Overall there have been few if 
any complaints from students with 
disabilities about this point." said 
Nancy Bloom, a secretary for 
Disabled Students Services "There 
is still a usable elevator in Walb 
unlike in Kettler. Neff and 
Classroom Medical where disabled 
students can sometimes encounter 
great difficulty in using the eleva- 
tors," she added Kettler was built 
over 30 years ago Neff and 
Classroom Medical only have one 
elevator each. 

"One student knew that there 
was an elevator back there We just 
had to show him where it was a 
couple of times so be could get 
(here comfortably." said Margie 
Guthrie, a counselor for students 
with disabUiues. 

According to Katter, the project 
should be completed by spring 
break In the meantime. Disabled 
Student Services would like people 
who are in need to be aware of (he 
availability of the service elevator. 



"He has 



ty to 
speak on 
the sub- 
ject," Neri 
said of 
Sonier 



Tbe president of the Native 
American Student Association 
(NASA) denied any political 
involvement with the petition to 
dismiss an IU professor for his 
alleged comments about Native 
American burial practices. 

LuAnn Neri, president of 
NASA, said her group is not 
allowed under university guidelines 
and the NASA Constitution to sup- 
port or renounce any ~~ 
side on political issues, 

NASA cannot offi- no au thori 
cially associate with 
Arthur Medicine Eagle 
Sonier, who wrote the 
petition, according to 
Neri. Sonier was origi- 
nally scheduled to 
speak to NASA on 
Wednesday. Jan. 31 
but Neri said Sonier 
will not be speaking. 

"He has no authority to speak on 
the subject," Neri said of Sonier 

Jheri Neri. LuAnn Neri's hus- 
band and executive director of the 
Fort Wayne Indian Center said. 
"Arthur Sonier is a charlatan and a 
fake He has no standing in the 
Native American community." 

"Technically, I can't have 
Arthur (Sonier] speak under the 
NASA banner I can't advertise. I 
can't put up flyers." Felicia 
Beeching, vice president of NASA, 
said Flyers advertising Sonier's 
Wednesday speech have been post- 
ed around campus, 

The Multicultural Services 
office confirmed Sonier is not 
speaking on Wednesday The flyer 
said the event was "Cosponsored 
by the Office of Multicultural 
Services and Native American 
Student Alliance " 

According to Beeching. Jheri 
Neri will protest if Sonier speaks 
on Wednesday. 

Tbe petition has been circulated 
by Beeching, and was initiated by 



Sonier. Sonier, former vice presi- 
dent of NASA at IPFW and current 
executive director of the Five Stale 
Alliance of First Americans, wrote 
the petition to dismiss IU anthro- 
pology professor Christopher 
Peebles for his alleged comments 
which appeared in the Indianapolis 
Star 

According to the Star, Peebles 
said, "Once you arc dead, you're 
dead. Your soul leaves your body 
and then you are just a bunch of 
bones " Peebles denies ever mak- 
ing this comment to the 
Indianapolis Star. 

Peebles said bis 
department has con- 
formed completely with 
the Native American 
Grave and Reparation 
Act (NAGRA). 

"As far as I 
know, the lab is in com- 
pliance with tbe 
NAGRA," Geoff 
Conrad. professor 
of antbropolog y 
_ at IU, said. 
^The NAGRA requires arcbcolo- 
gisis to notify Native American 
groups when remains are found 
Sonier said although NAGRA 
requires notification. Native 
American remains are not returned 
"Some archeologisis think their 
word is as good as God...No other 
people could understand our feel- 
ings." Sonier said. 

Sonier said although Peebles is 
not in violation of NAGRA. he was 
insulted by his comments. 

'They are supposed to give us 
back the Native American 
remains," Sonier said. 

According to Sonier, the 
Eurorace has no right to make 
determinations concerning Sonier's 
ancestors and what should be done 
with the remains and burial sites 

"I know a lot of Native 
American brothers and sisters and 
they share ibis point of view." 
Sonier said 

LuAnn Nen said she has never 
spoken with Peebles and never read

SES 
assists 
working 
students 



by Rebecca Kocnig 
Chief Reporter 

Undergraduates in need of a 
job can rind assistance from 
Student Employment Services 
(SES) located in Walb 113. 
Businesses interested in hiring 
new employees are listed in 
several large black binders in 
the SES office. For students 
whb qualify, work study 
opportunities are also available 
through SES. 

''Right now it's a student 
market because employers are 
almost desperate." said Mary 
Ball Brant, director of SES. 
According to Brant, anyone 
who comes into the office 
looking for a job should find 
one Because of the high 
employment rate, less people 
are searching for jobs through 
SES. 

An increased demand for 
employees has caused the 
average earnings to increase 
from minimum wage to about 
a dollar an hour more. Brant 
stated that some jobs even pay 
near ten dollars an hour. 

"I want something that's 
flexible and geared toward my 
major, communications." 
Monica Espinosa, junior, said. 
Espinosa said she had not yet 
found the job she was looking 
for. 

The SES office is for siu- 
dent use only. However, 
according to Brant the office 
does not check identification. 
Brant said there has nol been a 
problem in the past with non- 
students using the service and, 
if a non-student did use SES, 
then be or she may be able to 
afford to attend college, 
i "We don't chase anyone 
away." said Brant, 

The Federal Work Study 
Program also functions 
through SES, Students can 
apply for this program based 
on need when filling out finan- 
cial aid forms According to 
Brant, some students who 
qualify for the work study pro- 
gram are not currently using it 
SES is planning to contact 
those students soon. 

Students Tony Laux and 
Nick George work in the SES 
office as assistants as part of 
die work study program. 

"1 got to know the staff of 
career services and being a 
business major being with peo- 
ple like that may also help me 
get a job." said George. 
t SES is coordinating the six- 
teenth annual Summer Job Fair 
to be held on Thursday, March 
21 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in 
Walb Ballroom. Many area 
businesses are represented at 
' the job fair 

In the past as many as 800 
students have attended tbe Job 
Fair, according to BranL Due 
to high student employment. 
Brant said she only expects 
400 students this year

The Magic returns to NBA 



Ervin "Magic" Johnson recently announced 
his reemergence from retirement and his inten- 
tion to finish the season playing basketball for 
the Los Angeles Lakers, the team he led to five 
NBA championships. Johnson has made this 
comeback attempt before, but this time is differ- 



In 1993, Johnson announced he would be 
returning to the game despite having tested posi- 
tive for the HIV virus. Rumors about how 
Johnson contracted the desease plagued him for 
months as many refused lo believe the African- 
American athlete could get HIV through hetero- 



sexual sen. He met opposition from ignorant 
players who feared (hey were in danger of catch- 
ing the virus by playing games against Johnson. 
This prompted Johnson to bow out gracefully. 

Through education, the NBA players of today 
understand what causes HIV and what prevents 
it. If it had not been for Magic's unfortunate 
diagnosis, these individuals may not have 
learned the truth unlit it was loo late. Young 
people who idolize Johnson may not have 
learned aboui the ramifications unlit it was too 
late. Johnson's tragedy undoubtedly saved many 



Magic has always represented a kind of pas- 
sion that has been missing from the game of bas- 
ketball lately. With his and Michael Jordan's 
return, the sport has gained a sense of dignity 
again, which had recently been up-staged by big 
money players and green hair. 

We wish Johnson the best and salute the 
NBA's positive reaction to his return We hope 
the rest of the world will soon learn thai life 
does not cease when one contracts HIV.

ple of all, France during 
the French Revolution 

The differences 
between (he American 
Revolution and the 
French Revolution are 
striking, both in their 
philosophical origins and 
in their results The 
American independence 
^~ ^~ movement was led by 
men who believed that 
man was endowed by his creator 
with inalienable rights. We still 
function in a political system which 
originated over 200 years ago. pos- 
sessing basic freedoms which 
inspire foreigners to come to our 
shores, often at great cosl 

The French Revolution, led by 
Maximillian Robespierre. Georges 
Damon and Jean-Paul Marat, 
among crthers, foisted its own ver- 



sion of atheism upon the populace 
and expelled God altogether from 
society With no other higher 
authority to answer to, its leaders 
were "free" lo deal wilh society as 
they pleased, executing people at 
will. 

Being the leader of the known 
free world for mosi of ihe twentieth 
century is one of America's lega- 
cies. One of France's legacies is the 
guillotine; another is Napoleon 
Bonapane, who eventually dug that 
country out of its social upheaval 
only to devastate it wilh twenty 
years of foreign wars 

This nation's founding fathers 
were religious, Christian people. 
Their religion was the basis for the 
design of our government. It is also 
the reason this country has never 
experienced die shackles of dicta- 
torship in iis lifetime Abraham 
Lincoln's devotion to God led to his 
corresponding haded of slavery and 
is ihe reason the horrible institution 
is a part of our past, not our present. 

The problem lies in society's 
willingness lo kick God out of the 
public eye With a benign ignorance 
of history and a baseless fear of 
theocracy, so many people are will- 
ing to expel the true basis of our 
freedoms as they stand. That basis: 
Men are endowed by their creator 
with rights and are created equal 

Today, we are losing those 
bases. Ignoring a personal mandate 
from God. people have no reason to 
act outside of their own feelings; 
that was France's problem two cen- 
turies ago We still possess a legal 
system, which for all of its human 
faults, is the envy of the rest of the 
world. But wilh the nation's lack of

now only accom- 
plished through 
national tragedies like 
the Oklahoma bomb- 
ing and the Space 
Shuttle Challenger 
explosion. So on this 
first decade anniver- 
sary of that explosion, 
I challenge everyone 
to try lo remember 
where you were when 
you first learned of 
the tragedy. 

I was in the eighth grade It was 
a special day because in science 
class — I hated 
science class 
— we were 
going to skip 
lecture and 
watch the shut- 
tle launch live 
on television. 
Watching 
planes and 
rockets fly was 
never exciting 
to me. but ii 
got me out of 
talking aboul 
science, so I 
was support- 
ive. I sat in the 
_^_^^_^__ back of the 
room and was 
joined by Mr. Wells, my teacher. 
When the shuttle exploded, the 
room fell dead silent, with Ihe 
exception of Mr. Wells' sniffling 
nose I think I was the only one 
who noticed him crying because 
everyone else couldn't take their 
eyes off the screen- 
Mr. Wells regained bis steel 
composure and tried to comfort us 
We all walked out knowing we had 
jusi seen a dark moment of history 
take place. 




wish I too could 

be on a space 

ship, flouncing 

through the 

galaxies..." 



My next class was math, more 
my forte. The teacher, whose name 
I can't seem to remember, was not 
her usual self II tums out dial she 
nol only was upset aboul the shuttle 
explosion, bul she herself was a 
finalist to go aboard. This ruined 
me. I spent the next week watching 
all of (be news regarding 
Challenger and lying awake won- 
dering what would have happened 
if it had been my teacher instead of 
Chrisia McAubffe. 

The question ihat has resurfaced 
during ibis anniversary and ai 
many other occasions is: "Should 
we be wasting money exploring 
outer space?" I answer an adamant 
YES. The Challenger heroes may 
have lost their lives, but ibey did so 
for humanity. Space exploration 
has the potential of making life bet- 
ter for our children here on and, 
maybe one day, off Earth For the 
nol-so-disiant future, space explo- 
ration means many jobs and a 
chance for those talented individu- 
als who spend their lives studying 
space and astronomy to use their 
skills 

My roommate thinks that by ihe 
lime we get to live in space, scien- 
tists will have eliminated (he 
homosexuality gene, but I refuse to 
believe it. Look ai Wesley Crusher

Death penalty is fair 



To the editor, 

Friday, Jan, 26. 1996. John 
Albert Taylor was killed in Utah 
He was sentenced and executed by 
the state for the crime of raping and 
murdering a young girl. Some peo- 
ple were against this action, think- 
ing that it constituted cruel and 
unusual punishment or that capital 
punishment provides no deterrent to 
commuting murder. 1. however, 
believe that both these ideas are 
seriously flawed 

Is the death penalty, by defini- 
tion, a cruel and unusual punish- 
ment? I don't think so A cruel pun- 
ishment would be to peel off the 
man's skin and rub salt into his bare 
flesh If it was mandated that he 



should be sodomized in order to 
understand what it feels like to be 
raped, then this would be an unusu- 
al punishment John Taylor was 
quickly put to death by the method 
he requested: a bullet shot through 
the heart. 

Docs the death penalty provide a 
deterrent to murder? Of course it 
docs To believe otherwise is sim- 
ply to defy common sense. Bui for 
those people who have no common 
sense, let me pose the question this 
way: Does the death penally pro- 
vide any incentive for people to 
commit murder? Of course it docs 
not. Therefore, capital punishment 
is at worst neutral, at best a deter- 
rent, but never an incentive to com- 
mit murder 



To those who say that capital 
punishment is cruel and unusual. I 
respond this way It would be more 
cruel and more unusual to allow the 
demented and dangerous mind of 
John Taylor to continue it's exis- 
tence. To those who say that the 
death penalty provides no deter- 
rence to committing murder, 1 say 
this: John Taylor, a man who is 
known to have raped and murdered 
a young girl, has been permanendy 
deierred from ever committing such 
a crime again. On Friday morning, 
nothing cruel and nothing unusual 
took place. But justice was served 
in Utah as John Albert Taylor was 
put to death.

Gingrich/Souder agenda in question 



To the editor; 

In a recent tax-funded newslet- 
ter, incumbent 4th District 
Congressman Mark Souder advised 
readers to "Stand with us as we 
work to re-establish integrity in 
government,,." Interesiing advice 
from a guy who campaigned on the 
coattails of Newt Gingrich 
Consider this partial sampling of 
facts about Gingrich, culled from a 
Public Citizen mailer: 

• Gingrich bounced 22 checks dur- 
ing the House Bank scandal — 
including a $9463 payment to the 
IRS. 

• Gingrich took special interests 
paid vacations to the Bahamas and 
to a Colorado ski resort collecting 
S105.000 from 21 political support- 



ers to boost his income from a book 
he'd written, and in another case, 
took 513,000 that was supposed to 
support bis research for a novel 
That book was never finished, but 
Gingrich used the money to pay for 
a family trip to Europe 
* Gingrich pushed and voted for a

Souder' s refusal to support a res-

session of congress is one indica- 
tion that be is learning from the 
example of "integrity" set forth by 
his political role model Gingrich. Roger Schlegel 
The self-serving actions of Gingrich

when you lake inio account the

Instructor asks many questions 
about gay rights 



To the editor, 

This is a response to Paul 
Tupper's column of Jan. 11, 
"EACS — Not as Chrisiian as They 
Think," where Tupper expressed 
his displeasure with the condemna- 
tion by East Allen County Schools 
of the National Education 
Associations pro-homosexuality 
resolution. I also go beyond the 
specifics of that column. 

If you're in favor of eliminating 
"name-calling and jokes in the 
classroom," do you think that 
name -calling in Ihe form of "homo- 
phobe," "gay-basher" and "breed- 
er" should also be eliminated? If 
calling a homosexual a "fag" is hate 
speech, then is calling Christians 
narrow-minded bigots (as homo- 
sexual activists have done) also 
hate speech? If not, why not? 
Should anyone who publicly oppos- 
es the agenda of homosexual 
activists be jailed for a bate speech 

"Diversity" on a university cam- 
pus is now considered a good thing. 
Are Christians considered a part of 
diversity. (One good test of this 
would be to see if the need for 
Christians to be free from harass- 
ment and ridicule on campus has 
been discussed at Diversity Council 
meetings.) If not, why not? 

If you believe in the "separation 
of church and state," and it is true 
that some religions (and even some 
"Christian" denominations) are say- 
ing that homosexuality is accept- 
able, then is a pro-homosexuality 
message in the schools a violation 
of this separation? If so, exactly 
what church do you intend to sepa- 
rate from the state, and why? 

As a taxpayer, should 1 be forced 
to provide money for anti-Christian 
speakers like homosexual activist 
Donna Red Wing to come to 
IPFW? Are you as angry about that 
as you are about EACS claiming to 
be Christian? If not, why not? 

Do you know where the phrase 
"separation of church and state" 
came from? If so, do you kno 



what the intent was of the person 
who wrote that? 

People often accuse Christians 
of trying to "impose" their values 
on society. Since the purpose of a 
police force is to impose someone's 
values on society, should we elimi- 
nate it? Isn't the real question not 
whether someone's values will be 
imposed, but in fact whose values 
arc the best ones to impose? 

You say that "what we all have 
to agree on is that God loves all 
people and all things." If that is so. 
why does the Bible say, "The 
LORD detests men of perverse 
heart" (Proverbs 11:20) or that 
"The wrath of God is revealed from 
heaven against all unGodliness and 
wickedness of those who by their 
wickedness suppress Ihe truth " 
(Romans 1:18)? 

What would you think of a 
father who lets his children do 
whatever they want, no matter how 
much they barm themselves and 
others? Would you call such a 
father "loving?" If not, why is it so 
often claimed that the Christian 
God (described by Christ as our 
Father) is nothing but love? Is love 
without justice really love? 

One of the legacies of the sixties 
is that most college students have 
been brainwashed into believing is 
that people should have the free- 
dom to do whatever they want to 
with their own bodies'. Do you 
believe this? If so, are you in favor 
of the related "rights" to euthanasia, 
to use drugs, to engage in prostitu- 
tion, and to have an abortion? If 
you arc not in favor of these rights. 
how do you rationalize your incon- 
sistency? If you are in favor of 
these rights, where do you draw the 
line? What kind of things do human 
beings not have the right to do with 
their own bodies, and why? 

Homosexuals claim that they arc 
bom with homosexual desires and 
should not. therefore, be con- 
demned for acting on them. Since 
heterosexuals are also born with 



strong sexual desires, do you 
believe that teens or preteens 
should not be discouraged in any 
way from having sex. regardless of 
the personal and societal conse- 
quences? If kids arc "going to do it 
anyway." how is it that a number 
remain virgins until maniagc? 

If sexual desires arc "irre- 
sistible," are there other desires that 
arc also "irresistible?" If so, should 
society tolerate and encourage 
actions resulting from those desires, 
loo? 

If people should not be con- 
demned for acting on their sexual 
desires because such desires are too 
difficult to resist, should we base 
all of our moral decisions on avoid- 
ing difficulties? 

Do you believe that consenting 
adults have the nghi to do whatever 
they want to in the privacy of their 
own bedrooms? Given the fact that 
adultery usually leads to divorce, 
and given that divorce leads to dev- 
astating social consequences, would 
you be in favor of encouraging peo- 
ple to commit adultery? If not, why 
not? 

Many homosexuals claim that 
homosexuality has a genetic basis, 
Since alcoholism also has a genetic 
basis, should we celebrate National 
Alcoholics History Month' 1 If not. 
why not?

From the wheel to the kiln 

Students work with ancient art 
of ceramics " 



by Diane Duniel 
Staff Writer 



A walk through the ceram- 
ics laboratory on a 
Friday afternoon reveals 
about a dozen advanced students 
deeply engrossed in moving earth 
Some pottery is functional, while 
others are only decorative They 
include such items as cups, vases, 
bowls and even a large model of an 
Islamic mosque Each project is a 
unique expression of the artiM who 
created it 

One such artist senior Daphne 
Mildred, a general studies major, is 
taking her ninth semester of ceram- 
ics. She enjoys working with her 
hands and said she likes "(he primi- 
tive way that it is done" She no 
longer gets credit for taking the 
course, since she has far more cred- 
its in fine arts than the general stud- 
ies program allows, but that doesn't 
bother her. She loves what she is 
doing 

Mildred's specially is 
Southwestern style pottery, and her 
current project is a large bowl, a 
type probably once used to hold 
grains Her bowl will be used to 
bold plants, magazines or any num- 
ber of things She gives a lot of her 
pottery away and says they make 
great gifts 

Sophomore Mary Liebermari- 
Brandt is busy working at the pot- 
ter's wheel creating a lid cover for 
her recently finished bowl. The 
wheel is electrically run although 
Lieberman- Brandt controls the rale 
of speed with her foot pedal. She is 
working on her second degree. Her 
first was in business and she "hated 
it." When Lieberman -Brandt 
reached her 40s, she decided to do 
something she liked and returned to 
IPFW — this time in the fine arts 
field. 

"Slam it down in the middle 
Bring it up and push it down, and 
keep bringing it up and down until 
it's centered Then you make a hole 
in the center and bring it out to the 
sides," said Lieberman-Brandt,

describing the process of working 
with clay on the wheel She keeps 
her hands moistened with water 
from a bowl while working with the 
clay. 

Molly Fiechter, a junior fine arts 
major, is completing an earthen- 
ware cup. The process is time-con- 
suming and quite involved. First 
Fiechter mixes the necessary clays 
with water until the right consisten- 
cy is reached. Then the clay is 
kneaded like dough to remove all 
the air bubbles Next the cup is 
formed on the potter's wheel and 
allowed to dry to a leather-like con- 
dition. For a decorative design, 
strips of paper are placed over the 
cup, which is then is painted with 
black runny (slip) clay When the 
paper strips are removed, a design 
remains. The cup is then bisqued 
(fired) in a kiln (brick oven) 
overnight at a low temperature 
Finally, a clear glaze is applied and 
it is once again fired overnight in 
the kiln, this tune at a much higher 
temperature. The glaze makes the 
cup waterproof. 

Dianna Rowleii, who completed 
her B.F.A. three years ago, is now 
taking ceramics to complete a port- 
folio necessary for admission to 
graduate school. Her project is a 
large teapot that she has sculpted to 
resemble a tree trunk with a twig- 
like spout. Actual bark was pressed 
into the surface of the clay to give 
its texture a tree-like appearance 

Rowleit said she loves working 
with clay because "it is a very for- 
giving materia) You don't have to 
be intimidated by it. If you make a 
mistake, you just add water and go 
back and repair it." Her only disas- 
ters have occurred when bubbling 
or pin holing of the clay occurred 
during the firing process, and then 
she had to start all over again 



When pottery is fired, the kilns 
may reach temperatures as high as 
2300 degrees Fahrenheit, said 
McCroskey-Hrehov, an IPFW 
ceramics professor. The ceramics 
department utilizes several kilns. 
Many are needed, since different 
types of pottery require different 
temperature settings Common 
earthenware requires the lowest 
temperature setting and porcelain 
the highest, with stoneware some- 
where in between. For reasons of 
safety and proper ventilation, the 
gas-fueled kilns are located in sepa- 
rate sheds behind the Fine Arts 
Building. 

The ceramics department has 
recently acquired a massive gas- 
fueled brick kiln. It should be 
hooked up and ready for use in a 
couple of weeks This badly needed 
acquisition is largely due to the stu- 
dents' hard work and fundraising 
over the past year. Last spring the 
college ceramics club raised $5,000 
toward the cost of the $10,000 kiln. 
They did this by making ceramic 
tiles for the bicentennial murals 
located throughout the city of Fort 
Wayne (called gateway markers). 
In addition, last November the stu- 
dents held an exhibit and sale of 
their pottery and raised $1,000 
which will cover the cost of instal- 
lation of the kiln. 

Each spring the best of the stu- 
dent projects are entered in a stu- 
dent show or a separate show for 
seniors with only juried competi- 
tion, A display case in the hallway 
of the Fine Arts Building now 
showcases some very unusual and 
humorous student pottery creations 
from last semester. Most are worth 
the long walk over to see.

Organ donation: 

Making the choice 



by Jolene Adams and 

LLsa Steiner 

Special to The Communicator 

One Saturday evening a 27- 
year-old victim of an automobile 
accident is wheeled into the emer- 
gency room. His head injuries are 
so massive that within an hour he is 
declared brain dead In his wallet is 
a donor card authorizing (be 
removal of his organs for trans- 
plant. 

Instead of beginning the organ 
retrieval process immediately, 
however, the transplant coordinator 
reaches for the telephone to contact 
the victim's next of kin. In that 
short time, the victim's heart stops 
and the young man's organs .which 
may have saved several lives, are 
wasted. 

In Indiana organ donation is 
made possible through the Indiana 
Organ Procurement Organization 
(IOPO) Upon death of 
an individual 
IOPO 
notified 
imme- 
diately. 
IOPO 
then makes 
arrangements lo 
have the organ or tis- 
sue removed from the 
body within 8 to 16 
hours. With organ 
removal, the body ts not 
disfigured and can have a 
normal funeral After 
organ extraction, the trans- 
plant group in charge of the 
patient awaiting the dona- 
tion will pick up the organ, 
cool and preserve it. The viability 
of the displanted organs and tissue 
vary with each type. The heart, for 




instance, remains good for up to 
four hours, while hearl valves arc 
useful for ten. 

The number of organ donors has 
increased only slightly over the 
past five years, yet the number of 
people wailing for organs has dou- 
bled. A new name is added to the 
list approximately every 20 min- 
utes according to the United 
Network of Organ Sharing 
Approximately one fourth of the 
people waiting for organ donation 
will die before an appropriate an 
organ becomes available 

IOPO delegates to whom ihe 
donaiion will be given by use of a 
computer generated list. The list is 
confidential and identifies patients 
by a number and occasionally a last 
name. The record is arranged so 
that (hose with the most urgent 
needs have first priority 2nd the 
organs are distributed accordingly 
A need is present for donations 
of almost every part of 
the body Hearts 
are used for 
patients 
v I t h 
various 
lypes of 
l failure 
Emphysema and 
cystic fibrosis paticnis are 
only a couple of lypes of 
patients needing lung trans- 
plants The pancreas is 
given to patients with 
insulin dependent diabetes 
mellitus The outcome of the 
people's lives is contingent 
on Ihe generosity of others. 

There are iwo main class- 
es of death which determine 
what parts of the body can be 
donated. The two divisions are 
brain death and heart failure. Brain 



death occurs when patients are kept 
alive on a ventilator and the doctor 
pronounces thai the brain is no 
longer active. Almost any organ or 
tissue can be donated when this 
type of death occurs Cardiac death 
occurs when ihe heart stops beat- 
ing. In ihe event of cardiac death, 
organ donation is limited to the 
corneas, heart valves, skin, bone, 
saphenous veins and ischea. 

In a questionnaire sent lo donor 
families, 98 percent of the families 
who responded said they were 
happy with their decision in sup- 
port of organ donaiion. Many have 
fell consoled by being able lo offer 
their relative's organs lo others 
despite their own loss. 

People should see themselves 
not as potential donors, bui as 
poteniial recipients. Each person 
needs to analyze how he or she 
would feel if wailing for an organ 
donation. 

To become an organ tissue 
donor, simply sign an organ dona- 
tion card or the organ donor portion 
of ihe driver's license and have it 
witnessed by two persons. The 
most important step in becoming a 
donor is to discuss your wishes 
with your famdy members

Exploring thrift store shopping 



by Andrew Voder 
Staff Writer 

With the holiday season safely 
behind us and the charge card bills 
mounting ferociously, many stu- 
dents have no surplus money to buy 
clothes. This can be a genuine 
problem if one suddenly has the 
need for a new outfit or two and the 
Visa is already maxed-oul 

Have no fear, impoverished pro- 
letariat, your solution has been 
found. Now you too can buy new 
clothes at prices affordable enough 
for even the most meager budget 
You can experience what millions 
of people around the world and 
more than a dozen people in Fort 
Wayne have discovered. The joys 
of thrift store shopping can be 
yours as well. 

In Fort Wayne alone there are 
over half a dozen thrift stores to 
choose from. They sell items of 
clothing, furniture, kJtcbenware and 



virtually everything else under the 
sun. The items for sale have all 
been owned previously by someone 
who grew tired of ihcm and donat- 
ed them to the store. Some items 
were probably worn or used once, 
while others seem to have seen 
their last days during the beginning 
of the Reagan administration. 

"The best thing about shopping 
for clothes at a thrift store is that 
you can gel name brand clothing at 
a fraction of the cost," said sopho- 
more Becky Quail, anthropology 
major and dedicated thrift store 
shopper She said that she often 
spends up to half an hour searching 
for correct sizes and colors among 
the racks of clothing. Quail went on 
to say that the only type of clothing 
she does not buy at thrift stores is 
footwear. 

"I never buy shoes — except 
once — at thrift stores. It's just aes- 
thetically gross, thinking about 
someone else's feel," said Quail. 



Thrift stores, many of which are 
non-profit organizations operated 
by volunteers, arc plentiful in Fort 
Wayne. Most of the population are 
probably familiar wiih stores such 
as ihc Salvation Army and The 
Goodwill Thrift Stores — each with 
two locations in the Fon — but not 
everyone has heard of the Dove's 
Nest Located in Georgetown 
Square, Dove's Nest offers a vari- 
ety' of eclectic cloihing as well as 
African self-help crafts. Other 
stores include Concordia Thrift. 
located on 3319 N. Anthony Blvd.. 
and The Comer Connection on 901 
Huffman Rd 

Thrift stores arc all different and 
change regularly as the content of 
the donated goods changes They

Expressions in verse 



hy Alsha La Roche 

Staff Writer 

Drawing from memories of what 
some might say is one of the most 
beautiful places in the world. 
George Kalamaras. assistant profes- 
sor of English and linguistics, 
expresses his feelings on paper 
The words and rhyme seem to 
come to him naturally. Eventually, 
those feelings will produce a song 
or poem thai illuminates the 
moment the professor captured. 

During the summer of 1994, 
Kalamaras received a gram to go lo 
India There he spent .three months 
writing down his experiences. The 
poems were the product of his writ- 
ings. Kalamaras will be sharing 



those poems with any listening ear 
Feb. 12 from I to 2 p.m. in WaJb 
Union 224. 

Writing is not unfamiliar territo- 
ry to Professor Kalamaras. During 
his six years at IPFW. he has held 
positions that include assistant 
director of the English Department 
and the director of Creative 
Writing 

He is the professor one might 
see slaying after class to teach 
someone how lo reach inside her- 
self to bring forth the best that stu- 
dent has to offer Kalamaras says, 
"I want to give my students what I 
already have and watch them 
grow." 

Teaching and writing is a gift 
Kalamaras shares with his students 



everyday In fact, he says his inspi 
ration comes direcily from his stu 
dents. Relaxed, sitting with his legs 
comfortably crossed. Kalamaras 
explained, "I am inspired by stu 
dents who come with a longing to 
learn. "The professor said that it 
inspires him to see the accomplish- 
ments his students make as they 
grow and their worlds enlarge. 

"I really try to listen to my stu- 
dents. 1 want to understand where 
they're coming from so that I can 
help them grow within themselves 
and become better writers," said 
Kalamaras. 

If interested in creative writing, 
Kalamaras encourages students to 
attend the readings held here on 
campus He says it's a great way 



for writers to meet other writers 
The readings are a way of building 
a community of writers here on 
campus and in the Fort Wayne area 

"Writing has a rich oral tradi- 
tion, "Kalamaras said. Students 
should attend the readings knowing 
that a live performance gives the 
poems life and makes the piece eas- 
ier to understand, according lo 
Kalamaras. 

The readers who perform their 
work on campus include students, 
faculty members and renowned 
national poets. Professor Kalamaras 
has 45 minutes of poetry to read. 
He says be has no favorite writing 
but promises a delightful reading 



Real life includes 
real responsibility.

IPFW to offer free screening for eating disorders 



Press releas* from Nursing Degt 

Do you or your friends exercise 
compulsively and couni calories in 
an effort to lose weight and be 
extremely thin? Does your room- 
mate mn to the bathroom to ihrow 
up after a big meal? Do you or your 
friends think about food and dieting 
constantly? These behaviors are all 
signs that you or your friends may 
have an eating disorder Before 
these illnesses get out of hand, learn 
how to get help. 

IPFW will join hundreds of col- 
leges across the country in the first 
ever National Eating Disorders 
Screening Program (NEDSP) dur- 
ing Ealing Disorders Awareness 
Week, Feb 5 to 11. 1996. IPFW 
will bold the free program on 
Tuesday. Feb. 6 from noon to 3:30 
p.m. in Walb All screenings are 
free and anonymous. 

NEDSP is a public outreach 
effort designed to teach students 
about eating disorders and to direct 
those in need toward treatment 
The program provides students with 
the opponunity to bear an educa- 
tional presentation on eating disor- 
ders, complete a screening ques-

a health care professional. Those 
who show symptoms of an eating 
disorder will be encouraged to 
make an appointment for a full 
evaluation. 

"Each year we see students with 
advanced eating disorders brought 
into the health center only after 
ihcy have passed out while trying to 
jog. Even then, lying in a hospital 
bed with a weak heartbeat and 
almost no blood pressure, it often 
takes days for the students to admit 
they have been eating practically 
nothing and exercising compulsive- 
ly." said Kathy Hotelling, president 
of the Association of University 
and College Counseling Center 
Directors. 

Eating disorders are illnesses 
associated with severe body image 
distortion and an obsession with 
weight Sufferers are terrified of 
gaining weight and continue to diet 
or binge and purge even as their 
mental and physical health deterio- 
rate In addition to depression and 
substance abuse disorders, victims 



of eating disorders are also at risk 
of developing heart problems, 
osteoporosis, and reproductive dif- 
ficulties. Left unchecked, eating 
disorders can kill. 

"Four to five percent of all 
female college students suffer from 
anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating 
disorder, and at least five limes as 
many engage in substantially disor- 
dered eating behaviors," said David 
B, Her?.og, M.D., director of the 
Harvard Eating Disorders Center 
and scientific director of NEDSP 
"Although there is a preponderance 
of women with eating disorders, 
men are also susceptible and can 
suffer similar complications. Five 
to ten percent of all people with eat- 
ing disorders are men," be said 

People with anorexia nervosa lit- 
erally starve themselves by drasti- 
cally restricting their calonc intake. 
Symptoms include significant 
weight loss, loss of menstruation, 
dry skin, sallow complexion and an 
intense fear of gaining weight, even 
when underweight.

From the Locker Room with.., 

Assistant coach Tom Sutherland 



Sianding only 5-5. few people 
would ever assume that Tom 
Sutherland is a college basketball 
coach. Enter his house anil he will 
change that impression immediate- 
ly. As the assistant coach of the 



women's basketball team. 
Sutherland uses bis size and other 
impressions of him as motivation. 

"The best comment anyone ever 
made about me was that I coach 
everyday like I have a chip on my 
shoulder," Sutherland said. 

To put it mildly. Sutherland is 
intense He is a stickler for funda- 



mentals and has tried to instill that 
in the play of die basketball learn. 

"I am not very tolerant of people 
that are not fundamentally sound. 
However, my strongest suit might 
be defense." Sutherland said. 

Sutherland began his pursuit of 
defense and fundamental excellence 
nearly 14 years ago. 



"A friend of mine asked me to 
help him out coaching high school 
girl's basketball," said Sutherland. 
"1 have been coaching women ever 
since." 

Sutherland says that it is easier 
to coach women than men. 

"Girls far outwork guys." said 
Sutherland. "They have far less of 
an ego thing. Plus they arc more 
willing to listen and learn. It was 
true 12 years ago and is still true 
today." 

This is Sutherland's first season 
at IPFW. and he sees his coaching 
stint here as both a personal- and 
team-oriented opportunity. 

After working with current 
women's head coach. Pam Bowden, 
at Manst College. Sutherland 



thought ihe opportunity to rejoin 
her at IPFW loo good to pass up. 

"I came here (or three reasons." 
Sutherland said. "First, she is my 
friend. I needed a change in my 
coaching career and this was that 
chance. Finally, after talking with 
her a lot last year. 1 realized this 
was an opportunity to become a 
part of a program on the rise. That 
is pretty exciting." 

Sutherland has played a key role 
in the recent success of the 
women's basketball team. Although 
he would rather play his role from 
behind the scenes, his fiery attitude 
and intensity are hard to miss 

A few have said that if the 
members of this year's team can 
play for him, they could play for 



Bobby Knight at Indiana 
University. It is a reference 
Sutherland shies away from in an 
instant 

"1 take it as a compliment; it's 
extremely flattering but inaccurate." 
Sutherland said. "I have been to his 
coaching clinic and seen him run 
practice. What they (IU basketball 
players) go through everyday. .our 
practices are not nearly as hard." 

After last week's military style 
practices, his players might disagree 
with Sutherland. 

"Intense is probably the least 
offensive word they would use to 
describe me. but that is okay." 
Sutherland said.

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. What's the point of 
HIV testing? If you've 
got HIV, you're going to 
die "before your time" 
and why would anyone 
want to know that? 

A. Medicines are now 
available that can prolong 
the period of good health 
and prevent illness in 
people with HIV. Better 
treatments and possibly a 
cure may be found before 
those now infected get sick 
or die. Also, if you are 
infected, you must take 
precautions not to infect 
others.

Women return to winning ways; men's team continues struggle 



by Jim I'urtcr 
Sports Editor 

The women's basketball leam 
gol just what it deserved: a rest. 
Alter a week of military style prac- 
tice, the '[ions earned a bit of lime 
off- 
Two big conference wins last 
week put the Mastodons back in, the 
driver's seat in the GLVC By capi- 
talizing on their opponent's short- 
comings and improving upon their 
own defense and rebounding, the 
'Dons defeated Wisconsin- Parkside 
69-59 and St. Joseph's 92-76. 

"We decided to play." Coach 
Pam Bowden said. "We finally 
rebounded and the defense was 
much better " 

"I have to give the kids credit. 
tbey really rose to the occasion." 

Led by A 11 -American and Player 
of The Year candidate Lindy Jones, 



the 'Dons turned up the intensity on 
both ends of the court and took care 
of business according to Bowden 
Jones scored a combined 65 points 
in both games For this week's 
efforts the 5-9 senior was named 
the GLVC Player of the Week for 
the fourth time this season. 

Jones scored 22 points and col- 
lected a career-high eight steals 
against Wisconsin-Parks ide 
Against St. Joseph's. Jones poured 
in a school-high 43 points, grabbed 
14 rebounds and dished out six 
assists. 

"Usually I like to drive to the 
middle but they were cutting that 
off so I went baseline," Jones said. 
"Nobody was stepping in to stop 
me I don't want people to think it 
was an individual effort, it was a 
team effort." 

Tara Muzzillo. Jessica Henry 
and Leah Sheets all stepped up their 



efforts to complement Jones. In the 
win over UW-P. Muzzillo scored 
12 points and four steals Henry 
added seven points and six 
rebounds Sheets tallied eight points 
and four rebounds. 

In the win over St. Joseph's, 
Mu//ill&lt; i added 21 points and seven 
rebounds while Henry scored 12 
points. 

"We need to play hard all of the 
time and not take our talent for 
granted." Mu/zillo said. "1 think 
that last week we learned a lot 
about ourselves personally and we 
have come together as a team." 

Bowden credited the return to a 
more physical style of play as cen- 
tral to the success. 

'They proved a lot on Saturday 
(against St Joseph's) I feel real 
good... they had the guts to go out 
there and lake care of it," Bowden 
said. 



Against Wisconsin-Parkside, the 
'Dons forced 26 turnovers, includ- 
ing an astounding 23 steals. The 
leam also out rebounded both oppo- 
nents by an average of six rebounds 
per game 

"I think we are back on track." 
said junior Wendy Recker "We are 
still looking to accomplish the goals 
we set our sights on early in the 
season." 

The men's basketball team has 
yet to put together 40 minutes of 
consistent play thus far this season 
according to Coach Andy Piazza. 

"I have no idea what's causing 
it," Piazza said. 

Against both Wisconsin- 
Parkside and St. Joseph's, the 
Mastodons shot well from the field 
but failed to take care of the ball 
Against St. Joseph's, a premier 
team in the conference, the Dons 
shot 58 percent from the field but 



committed 26 turnovers. 

It is just one part of the team's 
play that frustrates Piazza and his 
staff and has taken a toll on the 
team. 

"It makes no sense to shoot the 
ball that well and commit that many 
turnovers." Piazza said. "We are 
doing everything well except we 
aren't taking care of the ball." 

The Dons last three games have 
come down to the last two or three 
ball possessions according to 
Piazza. The close losses have taken 
their loll on the team, but Piazza 
remains encouraged for the rest of 
the season. 

"We need to keep playing with 
our hearts," Piazza said. "The close 
losses are emotionally draining We 
need to keep our emotional batteries 
charged and I think we are doing 
that." 

For the Mastodons to return to 



the winning column, they will need 
to continue shooting the ball well 
from the field and somehow find a 
way to cut down the number of 
turnovers committed. 

"Right how wc are our own 
worst enemy," Piazza said. 

The 'Dons will get another 
chance to take care of the ball and 
return to winning ways this week as 
they return to the Gates Center for a 
pair of games. 

Tonight both (be men and 
women take on Quincy with the 
action starting a( 6 p.m. On 
Saturday both teams return to action 
against Southern Illinois 
Universily-Edwardsville. The 
women's game starts at 6 p.m. with 
the men's game immediately fol- 
lowing.

National Basketball Association 
Commissioner David Stem has 
done an excellent job in bringing 
the NBA into the middle stages of 
(he 1990's. When Larry Bird, 
Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan 
retired, many thought the NBA 
would lake a nose dive in populari- 
ty. However with Jordan and 
Jobnson back, the NBA is flourish- 
ing. The question that needs to be 
raised is that with powerhouse 
teams like the Bulls. Magic and 
Rockets all having a legitimate 
chance to win a championship why 
are so many teams in the league 
spinning their wheels in medioc- 
rity?

s on 
the shoulders 
of Bird, Kevin 
McHale, and 
OW-C Robert Parish 

is now treading 
to keep its 
beads above 
water. This 
transformation from contender to 
pretender did not occur over the 
course of one season as happens 
with some teams; no. this story 
begins in 1986. 

In the 1986 NBA draft the 
Celtics owned the fourth overall 
pick and chose Len Bias from the 
University of Maryland. Bias was 
considered a gift from God sent 
directly to the Celtics. He could 
shoot, pass and play defense and 
was an extremely popular choice 
with Celtic fans as he was a New 
Englander. Two days after the 



draft. Bias died of cocaine i 
cation. 

Bias, along with Reggie Lewis, 
Brian Shaw, and Michael Smith 
were to be the cornerstones on 
which the Celtics would build for 
the 90's. In '91 Shaw was traded to 
the Miami Heal, however. Then, in 
'93 the Celtics decided that Smith 
was not the player they had thought 
when they drafted him and he was 
promptly cut. And, finally, in 1994 
team captain Lewis died as a result 
of scar tissue which had built up on 
his heart. That brings us to the pre- 
sent-day Celtics and bungling 
coach, G.M.. waterboy. popcorn 
vender. M.L Carr. 

Carr has been unable to rebuild 
the franchise because of poor draft 
and personnel decisions. To con- 
tend in the NBA today every team 
must have at least one guard in the 
6'4 to 6'6 range. The Celtics have 
one at best, Todd Day And while 
Day has the height to be successful, 
he is considered average at besi. 
With backcourt mates Dee Brown 
and David Wesley, Day and the 
Celtics are often overpowered in 



games against teams with big 
guards like the Magic and BulLs. 

Another problem plaguing (he 
Celtics is poor draft decisions Acie 
Earl, Eric Montross and Erik 
Williams are good players but not 
the kind who will develop into 
superstars capable of carrying a 
team. Earl could not even make the 
roster this year and was let go in the 
expansion draft. The Celtics have 
been drafting these type of role 
players for eight years now with no 
pay off, except Dino Radja, who 
can score with ease but could not 
guard a closed door. Perhaps that 
has something to do with the 
Celtics status as the worst defensive 
team in the NBA. 



Carr needs to realize that it is 
time to rebuild and stop signing 
overpriced veterans who have 
passed their prime. After the mis- 
take last year of signing Dominique 
Wilkins and allowing Xavier 
McDanial to stay, Carr resolved the 
issue by letting both leave for 
Europe. Great move by Carr right? 
Not when you considered that he let 
the two leave so he could sign Artis 
Gilmore. one of the oldest player's 
in the league, and keep "Out of 
Service" Pervis Ellison who has 
been injured for most of his lime as 
a Celtic. Can needs to stop spend- 
ing on older players and use the 
money, instead, for younger players 
with talent to develop. 



As a Celtic fan it's time to real- 
ize the only way for the team to 
improve is for them to lose, and 

lose often to improve their draft 
position Only then will the Celtics 
get that impact player they need to 
rebuild Maybe then the Celtics 
could stumble onto a player like 
Marcus Camby or Tim Duncan to 
rebuild around And then maybe as 
Celtics fans we can be proud to 
wear green again Only then will 
the mighty Celtics be able to raise 
another championship banner to the 
rafters of the great Boston Garden, 
or I guess we could put it in the new 
Fleet Center.
