Earth Day '98 
activities planned 



By Dooie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Several years ago, when people 
were first made aware of a means lo 
prevent [be destruction of natural 
resources, recycling became a 
trendy thing to do. 

Much progress has been made 
since the early days of recycling. 
Recycling is still important, but 
more could be done. 

Sharon Murficld, president of 
the Biology Club, said she thinks 
involvement could be wider spread. 

"In the last 10 years people have 
taken an interest in recycling," 
Murfield said. "But we've stagnat- 
ed; we keep doing the same things. 
We need to do something to keep 
from going back to natural 
resources." 

"The earth is This 

year s Earth 

what 1 call awork Day should 

in progress. M S'Z' 



affect it. It's up to methods. 

Not only 
are new 



us whether ifs 



trve." 



als previously thought to be unrecy- 
clable, are now being recycled. 

Earth Day will be celebrated 
locally on Sunday, April 26, from 
noon until 7 p.m. at Headwaters 
Park. 

The national dale for Earth Day 
is April 22. but Murfield explains 
that it is easier to gel people lo come 
oui on die weekend. 

The seven hours of activities 
will include music by local groups 
and exhibits by local companies. 
Approximaiely 25 exhibitors are 
scheduled lo appear, including 
Omnisource, Citizens Action 
Coalition, Friends of the Third 
World, the City of Fort Wayne 
Community and Economic 
Development and City Utilities. 

Earth Day Festival '98 even 
includes enviro-based games and 
activities for kids, thai will not only 
cducale ihem aboul environmental 
concerns, but could raise self- 
esteem. Everyone receives a prize. 

Murfield is particularly excited 
aboul OmniSource's exhibit, which 
is a replica of aluminum recycling. 



This allows festival attendees to see 
what goes on in the process. 

Not all exhibits are extravagant, 
nor are they required to be. 
Some exhibitors may simply distrib- 
ute flyers about their company 
and/or Earth Day activities they are 
involved in. 

Murfield feels it is important 
ihat people have as much informa- 
uon as possible on recycling. 

"People are surprised aboul how 
Hide changes Ihey make can make a 
difference," she says. 

The Biology Club is working in 
conjunction wilh the Fort Wayne 
Museum of Art, which contacted 
them about "Recycle Reseen." 

"Recycle Reseen," can be 
described as 'folk art from ihe glob- 
al scrap heap,'" said Murfield, quot- 
ing from Museum of An promotion- 
al maierial. 

The traveling exhibit will be on 
display until mid-May. 

The Fort Wayne Museum of Art 
will also host a presentation by 
Janie Fink from the Raptor Chapter. 
The presentation is entided "Wings 
of Freedom." 

The Raptor Chapter works for 
the conservation and rehabilitation 
of birds of prey. 

The group's exhibit will be held 
inside the Museum of Art, instead of 
at Headwaters Park with (he other 
exhibits, because live birds will be 
present. 

Fink will bring a hawk, falcon, 
owl and bald eagle. 

The presentation is free, but 
space is limited. 

To reserve a space, call die Fort 
Wayne Museum of Art Education 
Department at 422-6467. 

The bands who will be playing 
ai Earth Day Festival '98. will be as 
follows: the Wailhounds, Todd 
Hanold, Might as Well, Rushville 
Whig and Adada. 

Sara Bums and Multiplicity will 
play acoustic sets between the other 
acts. 

Earth Day is funded by Student 
Government and the Biology Club. 

Most of the Biology Club 
money has been generated through 
its bake sales, Murfield notes. 

When one learns of Murfield's 
description of the Earth, it is only 
fitting that art and music be used lo 
celebrate Earth Day. 

"The earth is what I call a work 
in progress," she said. "Just by 
being here we affect it. It's up to us 
whether it's positive or negative."

Powell inspires at Coliseum 



American hero offers 
advice on the future 
of our children 



By Kathhyn Meichsner 
Staff Writer 



H ment, i must chose carefully 
when it comes to its chil- 



dren, said Colin Powell last 

Thursday at the Memorial 

Coliseum. 

"We either have to build them up 

or we have to continue 10 build more 

jails," he said. 

Powell discussed five areas mat 
can be improved to help America's 
youth: 

1) Make sure that every child has 
a loving, caring adult to go tc- ... 
role model, 

2) Have safe places where chil- 
dren can go to such as Boy's and 
Girl's Clubs and the YMCA, 

3) Make sure that children gel a 
healthy start in life and that they 
have gotten all the medical atten- 
tion that they need, 

4) Make sure Ihat they have Ihe 
necessary skills lo make it and 

5) Instill in children the need lo 
be active in Ihe community. 

Last year. Powell took part in the 
Presidenl's Summit for America's 
Future, which took place in 
Philadelphia. 

A result of the Summit was Ihe 
formation of "America's Promise- 
The Alliance for Youth," on which 
Powell has been serving as a chair- 
man. 

The Summit wilt be meeting 
again this year to discuss the 
progress that has been made on the 
goals that were set last April. 



This was also one of the parts of 
his speech. He focused on America's 
young people and what can be done 
to make this a better world for them 
to grow up in in. 

Powell represents the American 
dream of a person who did not have 
the best opportunities growing up, 
but has now become one of the top 
people in his field. 

He said that his family through- 
out his entire lire excepted nothing 
but his very best from him. 

Powell grew up in Harlem and 
from there he joined the military. He 
had a very distinguished military 
career having served his country for 
35 years and through 28 crises. 

His military career peaked with 
his appointment as Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. After leaving 
thai office, Powell said he needed to 
make a decision about where his 
party loyalty was. 

Powell compared his idealogy 
with that of the Democratic Party 
and the Republican Party. He said 
mosL but not all, of his beliefs fell on 
the Republican side of the fence. 

Powell believes that America is 
ready for a black, minority president, 
although he staled that he would not 
be running for die Presidency. He 
also believes that it would be possi- 
ble for a woman to become presi- 
dent. 

He spent 28 of his 35 years in the 
military fighting communism. With 
the end of the Cold War and the tear- 
ing down of the Berlin Wall, those 
who had once been our enemies, are 
now allies. 

One thing Powell pointed oul 
was the ability of this country to 
change when we focus on our prob- 
lems. 

"The image of IPFW has been 
enhanced by his appearance in Fort 
Wayne. It was a first-rate event. 
Powell was more than I hoped he 
would be. His speech was mar- 
velous," Butch Perchan, athletic

Police arrest second suspect 



By Nol Beckley 

Editor 



University police made the sec- 
ond arrest on Tuesday in iheir ongo- 
ing batde against people calling in 
bomb threats. 

Eric Stephen Drake, 19, has 
been charged with four counts of 
false reporting and informing for 
allegedly making bomb threats on 
the IPFW campus. 

Each count carries with it a min- 
imum punishment of one year jail 
sentence and a S10.000 fine. The 
charges are class D felonies and at 
press lime, Drake was being held in 
Allen County Lockup. 

Drake's arrest followed a month 
long investigation which is current- 
ly ongoing. 

University police chief Lauren 
DenHanog praised Ihe efforts of his 



entire staff in the arrest and capture 
of the alleged felon. 

"The whole department worked 
very hard on this case," said 
DenHartog. "It was a real team 
effort." 

In December, Allen County 
Police arresied Marcie Klotz of 
New Haven in connection with 
bomb threais made in the fall semes- 
ter. 

Klotz faces two counts of false 
reporting and informing for alleged- 
ly making bomb threats. 

This school year, IPFW has seen 
nearly 30 bomb threats. 

Most recently, seven bomb 
threats were made during the week 
before spring break. 

"This is the second arrest, and 
everyone needs to realize this is a 
serious offense," DenHanog said. 

"It's a felony and it will slick 
with you for the rest of your life. It's 
not a joke," he added.

Associate degrees 
expand scope 



By Dodie Miller 
Staff Writer 



Long a staple of technical and 
vocational schools. Associate 
Degree options have recently 
expanded at IPFW. 

Associate of Art (A. A.), 
degrees are being offered in pro- 
grams whose options before Ihe 
spring 1998 semester were only the 
Bachelor's Degree. 

The new A. A. degrees are 
available in the following pro- 
grams: Women's Studies, German. 
Spanish, History, English. 
Psychology, Biology and Political 
Science. 

According to Linda Fox, direc- 
tor of Women's Studies, the A.A. in 
Women's Studies alone is not nec- 
essarily preparation for a career in 
Women's Studies. 

"This kind of degree doesn't 
prepare a person for a job. It is help- 
ful for people who already have 
jobs. It enhances job skills," said 
Fox. 

Mary Helen Thuentc. die acade- 
mic adviser for the A.A. English 
degree, has similar thoughts. 

"The degree may nol qualify 
someone for the same positions as 
would a Bachelor's Degree, but it 
gives credentials and marks a mile- 
stone," she said. 

Thuente points out that many 
people attend IPFW for a number of 
years before graduating and reach- 
ing their original goals. 

Thuente is optimistic that hold- 
ers of the new degree will find 
employment. 



"There were many positions 

which require a two-year degree," 
she said. 

She does not, however, note a 
large number of students deciding 
against a Bachelor's degree in favor 
or an Associate's. 

The A. A. seems to provide a 
well-rounded education wilh con- 
centrations in the major area of 
study, which seems 10 make it 
attractive to many. 

Richard Manalis. academic 
advisor for the A. A. in Biology, 
takes a slightly different view from 
some of the other advisers regard- 
ing the usefulness of the A.A. 
degree. 

"I think it might be a good thing 
for students who aren't sure about 
college and (hey can at least come 
out with some degree," he says. 

However, he adds that many 
pursuing an Associate's degree in 
an area in which a Bachelor's 
degree is already available are 
painfully aware of a difference in 
usefullnesa of ihe degree. 

The degrees are "certainly not 
as competitive as a Bachelor's 
degree, but belter than a high school 
diploma," he said. 

The Associate's Degree is by no 
means obsolete, meaning there is 
still a percentage of the population 
that would rather be in school for 
two years instead of four. 

Linda Fox summed up the pur- 
pose of die A. A. degree: "An asso- 
ciate degree is like a mile-marker on 
the way to a 4-ycar degree, unless it 
is in a very technical field." 

Information on the degrees are 
available by visiting Kettler Hall or 
calling 481-6160. 



what is defeat? Nothing but education, nothing but 
the first step to something better.

We aren't leaders? 



iST UDE Nr^DE«Hip BAA/Qi/er / 



The evening was perfect. The rain 
had slopped, Ihe food was warm and 
everyone fell greai at (he Siudcnl 
Leadership Banquet . . . well, that's 
what wc were told. Wc wouldn't 
know for a fact, we weren't invited to 
participate. 

Apparently, we aren't considered 
leaders on this campus. Even though 
wc cover Ihe breaking stories and lead 
the siudcnl body to information about 
our campus. Even though wc give 
more time to our organization than 
some IPSGA members who show up 
once a month for a meeting, 

But that's okay, we aren't bitter or 
anything. It's just so nice to feel 
appreciated and to be recognized by 
the wonderful university that wc work 
for and strive to improve. 

Maybe if the folks who made out 
the invitations got off their backsides 
and came to our office they would see 
the work that is involved in putting 
together The Communicator each 
week. Perhaps then wc could qualify 
for attending the Leadership Banquet. 

Or, it could be something com- 
pletely different. Suppose some indis- 
cretion is said at the Banquet and it's 
the fear of us printing it in next 



week's issue. Because you all know, 
everyone is fair game to us. 

If we aren't considered leaders on 
campus then who is? The Vice- 
I'resideni and Treasurer of the "Magic 
the Gathering" Club? We think not. 
We aren't trying to toot our own 
boms . . , well maybe we are. We put 
in a lot of work for you and our cam- 
pus. The Student Leadership Banquet 
is a way for the University to pat us 
on the back and say. "Thanks for rep- 
resenting IPFW and for caring about 
our campus." 

Wc are guessing that either we 
have pissed someone off that 
addressed invitations or we haven't 
stirred things up enough for them to 
remember us. 

Either way. the hard-working 
staff at The Communicator, got shaft- 
ed. You'd think they could come up 
with something new; that's getting 
old. 

Our only mission this year was to 
produce the best paper that we could 
with the slim resources we have had. 
We thought we were doing a helluva 
job accenting the IPFW community 
with leadership in the direction of the 
future. Perhaps not.

Former IPSGA member defends letter 



To the Editor: 

Mr, Westrick. oh how soon you 
forget If you remember correcdy I 
was part of IPSGA before you even 
came to this university. In the three 
years that I served the students 1 
have tried hard to ensure that the 
students were treated fairly by the 
University and- IPSGA -itself. I 
wou ld ha ve served this year also, 
but 1 would nol commit myseTTlo 
doing most of the work and having 
others take credit for it. 

Mr. Westrick you have failed to 
see that the IPSGA is just a puppet 
government used by the administra- 
tion to push through any and all 
increases in student service fees, the 
production of new fees and any 
other propaganda that they wanted 
to show student support. 1 do 
believe that unless the IPSGA can 



truly reflect the views of the student 
population then they should be dis- 
banded. 

The only true service that is 
done for the students is that of the 
Student Activities Board. Matter of 
fact, SAB should be a separate enti- 
ty for IPSGA altogether. They 
should get a percentage of the stu- 
dent service fees, say 25 percent, so 
maTThey~cah TuIfHT their commit- 
ment to the students. What fun it 
would be to have a big name act. 
like Ms. Crow or Aerosmith, come 
to the university for an outdoor con- 
cert and not have the students pay a 
dime to see them. 

Yet, you know that will not be 
possible since it is a charter of the 
university to bleed its students dry 
without giving them anything in 
return. 



For example, when the student 
service fee was taken from 50 per- 
cent student use and 50 percent ath- 
letics use lo 40 percent-60 percent, 
the Chancellor's Office promised 
the students picnic events and free 
movies; that never happened We 
were lold that the new tech fee 
would give us unlimited access to 
the Internet and e-mail, but we still- 
have to log off of both if "we're" nor 
involved in class-related activities." 
Plus, only one new lab has been 
opened since the fee took effect 
three years ago. 

Open your eyes Mr. Westrick. 
or better yet pull the wool from 
them.

Spiritual power and Satanism 



To the Editor 

In the article "Boy Scouts 
today, tomorrow the world" in the 
March 26 issue of The 
Communicator, editor Nol Beckley 
correctly identifies lie spiritual 
power behind the California 
Supreme Court ruling-Christianity 

I would like to identify the 
spiritual power behind the prosecu- 
tion-Satanism. As these two 



armies mass for the great battle of 
Armageddon, it would behoove 
each of us to be aware of the prin- 
cipals, Jesus the Christ represented 
by Michael the archangel, and 
Satan represented by the beast (of 
the book of Revelation). 

Mr. Beckley appears, perhaps 
unwillingly, to have chosen which 
'side he will fight on. Others may 
choose nol to fight, but since with- 
out God's forgiveness offered in 



Jesus, we are all under God's sen- 
tence of death for sin, none can 
expect to survive as "innocent 
civilians." 

And now. none can claim igno- 
rance of the spiritual issues behind 
events either, ch? 

Tom Kruse

C&amp;DP Services 



If you don't like it, don't read it 



To the Editor' 

Mr, Wick, thanks for your letter 
to the editor concerning Nol 
Berkley's reverse racism story. It 
immediately made me realize that 
whiny little maggots like yourself 
make me sick. If the cursing in the 
article offended you, here's a novel 
suggestion. STOP' READING IT! 
It's J shame thai ihis newspaper his 
to waste valuable paper for some- 
thing as trivial as your complaint. 

Mine, I'm sure, is equally triv- 
ial however, I can laugh at myself. 



You on the other hand, seem to take 
yourself way too seriously. I could 
feel your pain when I read how put 
off you were when Mr. Beckley 
used such horrible phrases as 
"sorry-ass" and "bullshit." 

I'll explain this to you. Mr. 
Wick: I'm being sarcastic. I feel 
that, you calling Mr. Beckley igno- 
rant was totally uncalled for. The 
guy had a good point and I don't 
believe that cursing is grounds for 
you to call him ignorant. 1 think you 
should apologize to him. 

Really, I couldn't give a rats- 



ass about your complaint but if you 
felt so wronged that it compelled 
you to write and complain about 
this horrible travesty, I have news 
for you pal: In the real world, 
almost everyone talks this way. 
That's just the way life is. 

So my suggestion to you is get 
ashilload of stationery, or get over

Let it be said- 



The Communicator extends a sincere 
welcome to any and all members of the 
student body who are interested in work- 
ing for IPFW's student newspaper. We 
are looking for students with diverse 
backgrounds and from all majors to par- 
ticipate in all sections of the paper. 
Experience is not necessary. Whether 
you are a writer, artist, photographer, or 
have an opinion about something, be 
assured that your participation will be 
appreciated and will make a difference. 



What's up with all of the slick- 
ers people have on their cars these 
days? In the old days, you would put 
your favorite team on your bumper 
or window. Occasionally, the local 
"fish-fry" sticker hid a rusiing 
bumper. And then there was the old 
green and while "Pitch-In" sticker 
that adorned some cars in the 70s. 
Flower power created those really 
big flower stickers found on mostly 
hippie vans. My parents had (he 
"Support your local sheriff" one on 
their car; they never got pulled over 
either. I've got a Cubs sticker on my 
car and that's it. 

As you drive around Fort 
Wayne, you'll notice the vast array 
of stickers people put on their vehi- 
cles. It sort of shows the mentality 
of the city we live in. I see sports, 
especially NASCAR, alternative 
music bands, "tough guy" ones (you 
know who you are), siupid ones I 
see here at school, but I ran out of 
paper. I'm pretty sure that most peo- 
ple put slickers on their cars lo make 
some sort of statement The one that 
comes to mind is "Look. I'm a big 
tool!" 

First of all, less is more. I sit 
behind people at stop lights and 
barely have enough time to read 
them all. And yes. I do read them, it 
son of helps me qualify people, let's 
me know who I'm dealing with. 
Whenever I see a sports team, espe- 
cially one from five states away, that 
happens to be good, I think "band- 
wagon." The diehards, as they call 
themselves, also buy the team's 
apparel, just to complete the pack- 
age. Whatever guys, sports loyalty is 
one thing, but being a front runner 
fan is weak. 

Next, we have all of the little 
sayings. "Mean people suck" is my 
favorite. What do you mean by this? 
Are you trying to say you are nice 
all the time? Have you ever treated 
an animal badly or lied to a good 
friend? If you have . . . well . . . you 
suck too. Maybe you should go peel 
the slicker off now. 



Another one that comes to mind 
is the Christian sayings. "God is my 
co-pilot" and "My boss was a 
Jewish carpenter" are my favorites. 
Good for you, thanks for letting me 
know your religious agenda. I keep 
my religion to myself, my God tells 
me that ii is personal. And since we 
don't share the same God, I'm 
gonna back off. I did see a funny one 
the other day though. It read, 
"Gretsky ShooLs, Jesus Saves." I 
had to pull over 1 was laughing so 
hard. 

Then there's Nike. Treating 
third world citizens the way they 
do? Man, what a rotten company. 
Wearing this stuff is bad enough, but 
Nike slickers on cars and license 
plates on the front of cars? You kids 
crack me up. What do you want to 
be known as? Nike merchandise 
sales are on the way down, which 
proves it isn't as popular as it used 
to be. 1 still see it around this cam- 
pus and sometimes when I'm watch- 
ing "COPS" or music videos, if that 
tells you anything. Soon, Nike will 
be just another style fad, replaced by 
something new. I have a friend who 
won'l buy his kids anything with a 
"swoosh" on it. Right on. 

Here's the easy one, the num- 
bers. Let's see. ihe most common 
are: 2, 3, 6 and 24. It is cool to sup- 
port the drivers you love, but there is 
a limit. The bigger the slicker the 
bigger the moron. Again, less is 
more. Plus having more than one 
number on a car. just pick one okay? 
When I moved here from California, 
I wondered what all of the little 
numbers meant, I thought they were 
some sort of Christian thing 

Anyway, let's not forget the lit- 
tle cartoon man urinating on another 
car number or car make. This is 
probably the lamest expression 
someone can have. First of all, is 
this supposed to be Calvin from 
"Calvin &amp; Hobbes?" That strip went 
out like three years ago. So first, you 
are behind (he time in thai sense. 
Secondly, to be taken seriously, are 



you saying you would like to urinate 
on the number? Or the car? Or the 
driver? It sounds to me like you 
have some sort of problem, that 
maybe you should see somebody 
about your desire to urinate on 
something And you are doing it vic- 
ariously through a cartoon character. 
I can't even talk to people that have 
these stickers. Thanks for putting 
them on your car, now I know who 
Ihe idiots are. 

There is also tbe little Calvin 
holding bis crotch and giving the 
finger. 

Sorry, too easy, not much to say 
about this. I will say this though, are 
you flipping me off or just everyone 
behind you? You must not have 
many friends. At least not many 
adult, mature friends. And that is 
sad, just like Ihe decaJ. 

The "Bad Boy Club" admits 
right away lhat lis members are boys 
nol men. right. A small, little boy, 
wanting us lo know he is bad. 
"Waaaaa, I want my mommy!" 

By the way, decals are only con- 
sidered cool by the people who buy 
them. That is why you purchase 
them. I see all the "South Park" 
stickers are making their way lo Fort 
Wayne. Let it go guys, remember, 
when you buy into the mainstream, 
you become mainstream. And main- 
stream is very boring. 

Thanks for all Dead Head stick- 
ers loo, I know who hasn'l show- 
ered Patchouli smells worse than 
body odor. So remember when you 
buy a stupid sticker, think twice 
before you put il on your car 
because everyone who sees il. sees 
something other than a slicker 

Loser of the week- 1 golta say Paula 
Jones on this one. She loses her 
appeal to a higher court to have her 
case heard The nexl day we see her 
driving a Mercedes. She is still a 
loser. Everyone who believed her is

The Economy of the Soul Fort Wayne: City of Fear 



My Ou/n Viewpoint: Brett Coni 



l have a proposition for you. I 
know of a process that would allow 
a doctor to extract an eye from your 
head. The eye could be replaced 
with a glass replica thai appears 
identical to the original eye. No 
one could tell the differcnce-the 
replica can even move with your 
other actual eye so that everyone 
would believe you had two work- 
ing, functional eyes. Only, you 
wouldn't be able to see out of the 
glass replica. 

Here's the proposition: For SI 
million would you be interested in 
donating one of your eyes to sci- 
ence? Is the money worth it to you? 
Is SI million worth losing one 
functioning eye? 

1 first read this proposition in a 
book by a favorite author and since 
then I have asked quite a few peo- 
ple if they would consider doing 
this. About ball" of them admitted 
they would be willing to lose the 
function of an eye in exchange for 
a 51 million. The other half wasn't 
interested. 

Now let's up the stakes: For 
$50 milium would you be interest- 
ed in donating both of your eyes to 
science? Think of ii— $50 million. 
You would never have to work 
another day in your life. Free to 
enjoy all the pleasures of the world. 
Close your eyes and imagine just 
looking at $50 million in cash. 

Er... except not for you. You 
wouldn't be able to see your 
money. But you would be able to 
spend it and visit the most exotic 
and exciting landmarks of civiliza- 
tion. In America alone, you could 
enjoy the majesty of the Rocky 
Mountains, the mystery of the 
Niagara Falls and the glory of the 
Florida Keys. 

You just wouldn't be able to 
see any of them. 

And for that reason I have 
never encountered anyone who 
would be willing to give up both 
eyes for S50 million even if they 
could replace them with two glori- 
fied marbles. Now the real question 
is this: If you wouldn't give up 
your eyes for S50 million, how

much more valuable is your soul? 

Soul? The idea of the soul has 
fallen under hard times in America, 
not to mention the rest of the first 
World. Evolution has ridiculed it: 
TV has trivialized it and the 
Psychic Network has commercial- 
ized it. 

The death of a "soul" on televi- 
sion is too often dramatized for 
maximum ratings on television, 
whether it is a fictional account or 
factual report. Shell out fifty bucks 
and get 10 minutes of "wisdom" 
from someone you've never met 
and who's never met you. Make- 
believe spiritual advice invented 
with a pop psychology, sensible 
guesses and vulgar theatrics. 
Something to tingle the soul, if it 
exists. 

How valuable is the soul? If 
the eyes can't even be measured in 
millions of dollars, then surely the 
soul is priceless. 

So how should we respond to 
this truth: The soul is priceless? 
Let's make a whole bunch of taws! 
Right? The relevance of this strate- 
gy expired almost at its invention. 

We have spent too long whin- 
ing to the government about mak- 
ing laws. The government can't 
change the bean of people. As long 
as we do not consider a human 
being precious we will not respond 
to any influx of laws. 

With eager eyes we watch the 
highest court in (he country to see 
what trend it will set with deci- 
sions. We lobby and demand legis- 
lation from our Congress. We wait 
for the President to write an execu- 
tive order. But the soul of America 
is dying. 

The Fathers and Mothers 
throughout the history of our coun- 
try bled for what they believed in. 
The bad passion. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. bled for bis beliefs. Let 
truth bleed through you like blood 
soaks through the bandage placed 
on a deep wound. Be wounded 
with sorrow for the slain of this 
country. We weep for our ances- 
tors-the Native Americans who 
were the victims of genocide in the

those who perished in the slave 
trade or as staves in our country: 
the Jewish people who were 
butchered at the bands of Nazis; 
the immigrants victimized in the

We should weep for the suffering 
of our ancestors; there is no wrong 
in this- But how much more should 
we weep for our neighbors! Not 
Hispanics weeping for Hispanics, 
blacks for blacks, whiles for

Letting Go: Jeremi/ Ecenbarger 



Life is like a New York Cily play- 
ground. You've goi to jump over a 
lot of dog shit to get to the 
swings." 

-Steven Infantino 

I smell the fear that moves 
down the streets of Fort Wayne. 
The raw stench comes from many 
rural homes that fill the area where 
the three rivers meet. The grotesque 
odor passes from the mouths of 
familiar faces that we all know. A 
ghastly scent that is so overwhelm- 
ing many people do not recognize it 
anymore Yes, this cily reeks from a 
fear of change. ' 

A dread of modifying a com- 
munity's lifestyle is very common 
among small, rural areas like the 
cily of Fort Wayne. Many conserv- 
ative minds cringe at the idea of 
having lo alter their way of life. 
They continually work to ignore 
the switches that are being made 
around them. Most do not even try 
to fight against the variation, yet go 
out of their way to avoid direct con- 
tact with it. While many limes the 
avoidance may lead to a positive 
outcome, there are instances when 
drastic transformations can happen 
right under their noses. 

Southtown Mall is a clear 



example of how fear can cause a 
tragic metamorphosis. Has anyone 
been there lately? Looking back, 
many of us can remember how the 
shopping center used to thrive with 
business. Ii seemed like only yes- 
terday when my grandmother hand- 
ed me those pennies thai turned 
into my wishes as I threw them in 
the waterfall in front of what was 
once Walgrecns. I could have 
sworn thai it was just last week 
when I bought my dog at 
Southtown's pet store. And bow 
could I forget the first time I laid 
eyes on a naked woman? The 
posters in the back corner of 
Spencer's taught me all about "he 
birds and the bees. 

How things change. Now, as 1 
walk through the building, I only 
smell that overwhelming funk of 
. fear. As I look ai vacated areas 
where my memories lie, the smell 
becomes worse. I tried to listen for 
some sign of hope, but only echoes 
of the horrible change are heard. 
The arcade. J.C. Penney and even 
McDonald's have disappeared. The 
strong odor clearly chased them 
away. 

What was the fear? Different 
opinions range from gang violence, 
bad location id improper manage- 



ment. Maybe it was a little of each. 
All three elements were changes 
that the surrounding community. 
Fort Wayne residents, refused to 
deal with. In effect, we avoided 
confrontation and moved. People 
were engrossed with protecting 
themselves and allowed the shop- 
ping center lo become what it now 
is, extremely broke. The stench was 
just too strong for us lo bear 

Everyone is accustomed to this 
odor I smell. Each of us has a dif- 
ferent scent that we cannot seem to 
rid ourselves of. We try to light a 
candle, burn incense or spray 
deodorizer to weaken it. However, 
it has embedded itself into our 
clothing, has soaked our skin and 
fogged our minds We overwhelm 
ourselves with ideas of how things 
should be or smell, which only 
makes the aroma more inescapable. 

Small towns are filled with this 
polluted air. Sooner or later, there 
will come a time when we can 
begin to find the significance 
behind this strong sense. Maybe 
then, wc can embrace ii. study it 
and find ways lo rid ourselves of it 
completely. The intensity of the 
stench has gone down over lime. 
But, 1 still feel it in my nostrils. 
And oh, how it makes me feel sick.

Toys! Toys! Toys! 



By Kellv Bergman 
Features Editor 

When I was a boy. the toys to 
have were the Star Wars action fig- 
ures. I would spend hours wilb 
ibose Utile pieces of molded plas- 
tic. Occasionally the family dog 
would gel bold of one and I'd have 
lo save for weeks to get another. 

As time has passed, we have 
seen many action figures come out 
and there have really been quite a 
few changes from the ones that 
were popular back in the days of 
Star Wars. 

Since then there have been 
many action figures come and go. 
You remember them as well as I 
do. The Transformers, Teenage 



Mutant Ninja Turtle. Centurions 
and coundess other pieces of plas- 
tic have hit the shelves of the stores 
in the last several years. 

The action figures that have 
usually held out and been the most 
popular are the ones that have been 
based on the characters from tele- 
vision and the silver screen. We 
have all seen the Mighty Morphin 
Power Rangers who came from the 
television show of the same name. 

As of lately, about every 
"blockbuster" film that comes out, 
you can expect to find an assort- 
ment of action figures. "Jurassic 
Park" and "Lost World" put out a 
wide assortment of dinosaurs for 
children, complete with removable 
flesh on some of them. 



"Independence Day" put out some 
action figures and toy models of 
the alien ships. 

Already this year, "Lost in 
Space" action figures and assorted 
other items have been put onto 
shelves. The one from this film that 
I am most impressed with is the the 
ED 209- looking lobot from the film 
that is remote-controlled. 

Look forward to seeing an 
onslaught of Godzilla action fig- 
ures. Expect the new Godzillato be 
a greenish -black color. 

For all of you fans of horror 
films, an action figure of Jason 
Voorhecs from the Friday the 13th 
series is expected to come out 
some time in September. Expect 
him to be wielding a machete. 



Some things are worth waiting for 



By Adam Taylor 
Staff Writer 

Amy and Dave were an unlike- 
ly pair. 

They met each other during the 
beginning of their senior year of 
college and hardly fell in love at 
first sight. 

As a matter of fact, it look 
Dave two weeks to ask her out and 
even longer for her to agree to it. 
After going out on a few dates 
though, they realized that whatever 
it took them to get where they were 
was well worth it. 

After a few months, they were 
together nearly all of the time. 

One couldn't be seen on cam- 
pus without seeing the other right 
by their side, or not far from it. 

They began staying together on 
the weekend, their designated 
"blow-off' time together when nei- 
ther work nor school was allowed 
to get in the way. if at all possible. 

Dave would fall asleep on the 
couch most of the time, as his 
workload was a bit more than hers, 
i but Amy would just grab a blanket 
and cuddle up there with him. 

They both slept so soundly 
you'd think they were sleeping 
alone in a king sized bed. 

The school year progresses. 
however, and things began to get a 
little rough. 

Dave, an engineering major, 
was having to do more and 
keep his grades up and Amy wa 
doing her best just to keep her 
bills paid. 

Pretty soon, they wen 
having lo cut into their 
weekends more and more. 

At first it didn't seem 
like much, as it'd just be a 
few hours or so, but after 
awhile things had got- 
ten so hectic, they 
barely saw each other 
at all, with the excep- 
tion of school. 

Graduation time 
came around and 



Dave began to worry. 

He knew that Amy wasn't 
ready to leave and that they'd 
grown so far apart by then, there 
was no way be could compromise 
his career over the possibility that 
things might work out. 

The way be saw it, the only 
options be had were to stay there 
with Amy or forget about his 
career. 

Despite knowing he'd hate 
himself if he left her, he knew he'd 
begrudge ber if he gave up his 
engineering career for her. 

With a long face, Dave told 
Amy goodbye. 

A girl with Amy's looks would- 
n't have taken long to find a possi- 
ble replacement for Dave. She'd 
already had three offers to go out to 
dinner sometime. For some reason 
though, she just didn't have it in 
her. no matter how much they'd 
grown apart. 

She wanted Dave to stay 
because things would have likely 
been belter if she would've only 
had to worry about work. 

She also knew that where they 
were was the last place an engi- 
neering major would want to be as 
far as possible jobs were con- 
cerned. 

Also, she wasn't ready to leave 
yet. as Dave had accurately 
guessed. 



decid- 
ed lo 




about relationships for awhile and 
concentrate on her goal: to become 
a high school math teacher. 

Years passed and neither Dave 
nor Amy thought too often about 
each other. 

Amy had gotten her Master's 
Degree in Mathematics and was 
leaching a high school math class 
in Vermont just as she dreamed. 

Dave was a successful architect 
living in New York City. 

Neither had married, as their 
careers were just gelling underway, 
but both had dated over the years lo 
keep themselves in contact with the 
possibility of a family someday. 

Though a couple of Amy's 
relationships had been prospective, 
she'd always find some sort of fault 
with the guy and leave him. 

Dave was the other way 
around, though. 

The woman usually found fault 
with him and left him standing at 
the skid marks. 

One day, Dave was hanging 
around an empty apartment build- 
ing going through some of his old 
junk, and found, a letter tha.t.Ainy, 
had written him once. Upon read- 
ing it, Dave was reminded of a time 
that had seemed hectic, yet was 
also one of the most enjoyable 
times of his life. After thinking a 
while, he called up Amy's mom 
(whose number he had written on 
an envelope in his desk drawer) 
and got Amy's new number. 

Dave flew out there the follow- 
ing weekend and, a good eight 
years after they'd first met and left 
each other, he and Amy hit it off all 
over again. 

Two years later, iheir ten years 

of waiting for the other, right 

person ended wiih the sound 

of wedding bells. 

Perhaps some 

things were 

meant to be 

after all.

Soto named to first team Dons stoked to play Lewis, OSU 



By Nol Beckley 
Editor 

A fter a spectacular year 
/\ spending most of the lime 
* V near the top of the polls, 
L &lt;&gt;cvcral Volleydons have received 
recognition for their above-average 
performance. 

Hector Soio joined three play- 
ers from MIVA leader Ohio Stale 
and players from Lewis University 
and Loyola of Chicago on the first 
team. 

This is Soto's second trip to the 
first learn. The first came last year. 

Sellers Chris Gisslen and 
Ricardo Soler were named to the 
MIVA second team. 

This was a first time selection 
for both players. 

Soler and Gisslen joined two 
players from Lewis University, one 
from Ball Stale and one from Obio 
Stale. 

Amie Ball, head volleyball 
coach, said ibis conference compe- 
tition was very tough this year, so 
this year's ail-conference selections 
were tougher to receive. 

This year three MIVA teams 
(Lewis. IPFW and Ohio State) 
stayed solidly in the top 10 national 
rankings. 

"We're very pleased to place 
three kids in the all-conference 
teams," he said. 

Although Ball said be was 
proud of the selections, he said he 
would be even prouder if the Dons 
took home the MIVA crown in the 
next couple of weeks. 

If the Dons take the tourney. 
they will travel to Hawaii for the 
final four.

The Midwest Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Conference (MIVA) iout- 
nameni started with a bang this 
weekend Tor IPFW. 

The team swept its opening- 
round match against Quincy 
University by winning ihree straight 
matches. 

To win the conference tide the 
team must next beat Lewis 
University. 

In the two earlier matches 
involving these learns, IPFW won 
the first but Lewis captured liie sec- 
ond match in five games. 

Lewis is led by Victor Rivera 
and Edgardo Deniz. 

Rivera was voted as Player of 

the Year in the MIVA and Deniz was 

Freshman of the Year for the Flyers. 

Coach Amie Ball feels that his 



team has been successful in the mid- 
dle on offense against Lewis and i&lt; 
already plan- 
ning on how to 
defeat the 
Flyers. 

"Lewis has 
several differ- 
ent lineups but 
each lineup has 



us, but they may look down on us 
because of the loss of Ricky," said 



"I will have the 
team ready to play 



Ball. "They 
will come pre- 
pared to play 
us though."

"We would like to lake s

With two losses against Ohio 
State during the regular season they

"When we make 'il 10

Coach, team keep winning 



By Tony Laux 
Sports Editor 

The mens baseball team found 
the right track last week by winning 
three games and only losing once. 
IPFW lost lo Indiana Tech hut won 
against Hillsdale and swept 
Kentucky Wesleyan in a two game 
set. 

Coach Tony Villorio felt 
Kentucky Wesleyan was the best 
"speed" team that his players had 
faced this season. 

"This weekend knotted tilings 
up in the Conference," said Vittorio. 
"This puts us fourth in the division, 
so everybody is within striking dis- 
tance." 

Matt Erpelding and Brad 
Smock have lead the charge to the 
team's success. 

"Erpelding has been pitching 
well for the team," said Viltorio. 
"Smock is a freshman outfielder 
who is tied for lhe lead in bailing," 

Even wilh lhe success, Viltorio 
feels thai he still needs some of his 
players to step up, especially on lhe 



mound. 

"Mike Scroggs and Keith 
Weaver ... we need them 10 put us 
over the lop," Vittorio said. 

Unlike past years, this team's 
success has left the Dons with 
something lo play for. Their 20-10 
record leaves them only four games 
away from lhe school record for 
wins with 20 games left. 

Another milestone within reach 
is Viltorio's 200th collegiate win. 
He only needs 11 more wins to 
reach this goal, but he said team 
success is more important to him 
than his own personal success. 

Viltorio plays down talk about 
reaching this milestone because he 
wants lhe players to remain focused 
on winning the conference. 

This week's opponents are 
Buder, University of Indianapolis 
and Indiana Wesleyan here on 
Thursday and away at the 
University of Wisconsin-Parkside 
on Saturday and Sunday.
