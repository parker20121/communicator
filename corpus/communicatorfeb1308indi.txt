Market prepares

By Jessie Ruckman 



A hough economists 
say ihe U.S. may be 
heading for a recession, 
Valentine's Day sales 
may remain unaffected 
by the backslide. The flo- 
ral, confection, and even 
restaurant industries are 
expecting to see at least 
some growth over last 



year's Valentine's totals. 
According to FTD Group, 
Inc.'s quarterly forecast 
for 2008, 2008's consoli- 
dated revenue grew S4.0 
million to S155.5 million, 
compared to consolidat- 
ed revenue of S 1 5 1 .5 mil-

of fiscal year 2007.

One marketing insider 
said, "Flowers, choco- 
late, jewelry, lingerie, and 
perfume merchants do 
quite well for Valentines 
day. Also personalized 
romantic gifts do well 
do for Valentine's Day. 
Chocolate sells well on 
this holiday. Seems odd, 
but I only (purchase) 
chocolate gifts before 
the Valentine's holiday." 
Speaking of Chocolate 

The Ft. Wayne 
chocolate industry is 
preparing for V-Day, 
and businesses like 
DeBrand's Fine Choco- 
lates are also expect- 
ing a boost in business 
in the week leading up 
to Valentine's Day. Ac- 
cording to Tl Ochoa, as- 
sistant manager of the 
Auburn Road store, the 
staff prepares for V-Day 



by providing extra staff, 
greeters and an overall 
game plan. 

"We prepare for 
Valentine's Day like we 
do Christmas, but we 
generally have one con- 
solidated week of sales 
as opposed to the month 
leading up to Christ- 
mas. The week leading 
up to Valentine's Day is 
intense because we are 
dealing with a bunch of 
guys, and the rush is so 
compact," said Ochoa. 

Ochoa's best 
advice: beat the crowd. 
Confections, such as 
chocolate from DeBrand 
last anywhere from three 
days to four weeks, and 
the staff is trained to ed- 
ucate customers. Boxes 
of chocolate also come 
with a guide with details 
about how to care for the 
chocolate. 

The American 



economy may be back- 
peddling faster than 
the stance of presiden- 
tial candidates, but the 
Valentine's Day holiday 
may be doing its part in 
building a dam to stop 
the slide. 

And as the old adage goes, 
"Love makes the world 
Imarket] go 'round."

Save some sweet 
cash on VDay 



It's 

(third 

party! 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

RuckjIOISiphved 



I despise Valentine's 
Day. There is so much 
pressure to be impossi- 
bly romantic, extra beau- 
tiful, thoughtful, etc.; it's 
24 hours of nightmarish 
surreralism. This is a day 
- nay- an annual institu- 
tion based on Saint Hall- 
mark instead of Saint 
Valentine. 1 am muti- 
nous and slightly hostile 
when it comes to Feb. 14, 
to say the very least. 

The expectation is 
much like this: your Val- 
entine meets you at the 
door with a dozen red 
roses (cliche, and at a 
price of about $90), a 
snooty dinner at Club 
Soda complete with a 
botde of Jadot Beaujolais 
Village and rack of lamb, 
hold the mini sauce 
please (conservatively 
S150). 



Then it's off to the 
romantically lit down- 
town for a carriage ride 
($75 per hour), and as a 
nightcap there's always 
dessert at Debrand's 
Fine Chocolates, lo- 
cated throughout Fort 
Wayne (hot chocolate 
and dessert for two will 
run no less than $20). 

How many college 
students can afford to 
drop over $300 for one 
evening with not even 
a guarantee of V Day 
coitus? Much like spit- 
ting into the wind, that's 
just stupid. Let's discuss 
some realistic options, 
shall we? 

For those who are 
winos, toss a great bot- 
tle of wine into a ther- 
mos, grab some paper 
cups and snuggle on a 
park bench, laughing 
the evening away. Even 
some great wines are 
reasonable in cost, and 
the Beaujolais Village 
runs about $15 at most 



stores. 

Grab some Chinese 
takeout and rent a cou- 
ple of great classic horror 
movies. Light a few can- 
dles and - bam! - ins tan dy 
excellent V Day that is well 
within the budget. 

Take a bubble bath 
with your loved one - 
again, add some candles 
and wine to the equation. 

Get out your old board 
games, invite a couple of 
friends over and order a 
pizza. Split the cost and 
enjoy a little friendship 
with a dash of romance. 

Think about this before 
you drop a boatioad of 
cash on just one evening 
of pomp &amp; circumstance: 
someone who really loves 
you knows what makes 
you tick. 

And while everyone 
likes to be spoiled, use 
your brain instead of plas- 
tic and so something really 
romantic - spend quality 
time with someone, and 
not just quality cash. 



Politics &amp; dating just don't mix 

By Anonymous 



Like a rash on yourin- 
ner thigh, Valentine's Day 
has returned. If you're 
single, the entire month 
of February is just one 
long reminder of how 
alone you are. Still, there 
is one good thing about 
being single on Valen- 
tine's Day: no matter 
how lonely I get, al leasi 
I'm not with Heather.* 

I admit, 1 may be 
partly to blame for what 
happened. Political de- 
bates have no place on a 
date. Still, I hope I never 
see her again. 

A couple weeks be- 
fore the semester hegan, 
a friend of mine men- 
tioned that one of his co- 
workers was a beautiful 
girl in need of a guy. Her 
name was Heather, and 
we had the same major. 

"What does she look 
like?" I asked. "If you say 
■great personality,' the 



deal's off." He assured 
me that Heather looked 
like a young, if slightly 
more cu rvac e ou s , Wino- 
na Ryder. This was great 
news. My last blind date 
had looked like Danny 
DeVito in capris. So, 
Operation Big Date was 
all systems go. 

As I strolled into the 
resturant, I looked for 
the black dress she had 
promised to wear ihat 
night. As promised, she 
looked just like Winona 
Ryder. InBeetlejuice. 

The date started well 
enough. She had a great 
laugh, and she seemed 
pretty smart. But when I 
brought up politics, ev- 
erything went downhill. 

She said, "I'm voting 
for Hillary. 1 don't really 
care about her policies, 
I just want a girl presi- 
dent." 

1 remarked that 
Lindsay Lohan was also 
a girl, but she would 
probably make a poor 
Commander-tn-Cheif. 
Also, if this was how 



women were going to use 
their right to vote, per- 
haps they shouldn't have 
it. How did Heather read 
to all this? 

She stabbed me. 

Earlier, 1 had handed 
Heather a pencil so she 
could write down my 
email address. As we de- 
bated the merits of anoth- 
er Clinton administration, 
she gestured vigorously 
and, the next thing I knew, 
1 had the sharpest pencil 
in the world imbedded in 
the back of my hand. 

I screamed, grabbed 
my coat and phone, and 
left her with the check. 
(Hey, you slab me, you 
have lo pay. It's only fair.) 
Moments later, I was in 
the ER, having my hand 
cut open. A piece of wood 
had broken off and the 
doc cut my hand open to 
gel it out, leaving me with 
five stitches. 

VDay will be a bit less 
depressing this year. No 
matter how lonely I get, 
being alone is better than 
being with a psycho.

Time to pay the piper? The importance of Iraq 

New legislation may force college T he candidates each have very 
students to subsidize the music industry di ff er ent plans for the war 




By DOUGALAS SCHMIDT 

5chmdnD1©iplw.edu 



The House recently 
passed the College Op- 
portunity and Afford- 
abilityAct of 2007, which 
is designed to reduce the 
cost of textbooksand to 
make it easier to apply 
for financial aid. How- 
ever, a portion of the bill, 
if not removed by the 
Senate, would effectively 
force college students to 
subsidize the music in- 
dustry. 

Section 494, "Cam- 
pus-based digital theft 
prevention," would re- 
quire colleges to offer 
"alternatives to illegal 
downloading or peer- 
to-peer distribution of 
intellectual property as 
well as a plan to explore 
technology-based deter- 
rents to prevent such il- 
legal activity." The "legal 
alternatives" would like- 
ly be paid services like 



Napster, Rhapsody and 
iTunes. 

According to the non- 
profit association Edu- 
cause, the bill could re- 
sult in the educational 
system being forced to 
provide a $400 million 
subsidy to the music in- 
dustry every year. Col- 
lege students could find 
music added to their tu- 
ition bills, whether they 
want it or not. 

The "technology- 
based deterrents" men- 
tioned in the bill refer to 
network filters designed 
to prevent file sharing. 
Like the legal music ser- 
vices, the filters would 
also have to be paid for 
by someone, most likely 
the students. 

However, any sort of 
file sharing prevention 
plan is unlikely to com- 
pletely eliminate illegal 
copying. Even a school 
shut down its network 
entirely, students could 
still resort to "sneaker- 
nets," simply exchanging 
mp3-filled CDs, DVDs or 



flash drives by hand. As 
portable media becomes 
ever cheaper, such 
sneakernets will become 
easier and more difficult 
to stop. Already, 160 giga- 
byte portable hard drives 
can be had for less than 
$100. 

At this point, the lan- 
guage of the bill does not 
make it clear what pen- 
alty schools would suf- 
fer for not developing a 
"digital theft prevention" 
plan. Opponents of the 
legislation, such as Edu- 
carse and the Associa- 
tion of American Univer- 
sities, are concerned that 
schools may risk losing 
federal funding. 

According to tech- 
nology news site http:// 
arstechnica.com, Rep. 
Steve Cohen (D-Tenn) 
introduced an amend- 
ment that would have 
prevented schools from 
losing their funding, but 
the amendment was later 
pulled from the floor.

The United States has 
been firmly entrenched 
in Iraq for nearly five 
years, and as voters grow 
weary of the ongoing 
struggle and primary 
season winds down, the 
clear frontrunners are 
Republican Sen. John 
McCain and Democrats 
Sen. Hillary Clinton and 
Sen. Barack Obama. 
They each have different 
strategies on how to deal 
with the war in Iraq. 

McCain's Web site

The question of stay- 
ing in or getting out of 
Iraq is a complicated one 
and either choice could 
yield very negative con- 
sequences. CNN reports 
that leaving an unse- 
cured Iraq could lead to 
a war involving most of 
the Middle East. It could 
also provide a safe haven

Top 10 tips for a romantic VI 

10. If you waited until now, the flower shops are empty, but you cai 

still get roses at pharmacies, gas stations, and cemeteries. 

9. When you pick up your date, there's no reason to walk all the way 

to the door. Just honk until she comes outside. Keep honking until 

she gets in the car, puts on her seatbelt, and kisses you hello. 

8. Good gift: chocolate. Better gift: jewelry. Best gift: 

chocolate jewelry. 

7. Mix CDs are always a nice touch... then again, so is ecstasy... then 

again, what touch isn't nice...ladies? 
6. Ladies love a "take charge" kind of guy, so if you go out to dinner, 
feel free to order for her. "I'll have a salad and a Diet Sprite, and the 
lady will have three Big Macs, six large fries, and eight hot apple pies. 

And can you pour the burger grease into a Coke? She likes that." 
5. If you have kids and need time alone for romance, try making 

milkshakes widi vanilla ice cream and Nyquil. 
4. Feeding each other can be romantic, but only if you pick the right 

foods. Strawberries are a great choice. BBQ ribs, not so much. 
3. If you're in a moment of passion and forget your date's name, 

don't worry! Most girls are named "Becky." 
2. Having a chauffeur will allow you to have more time in the back- 
seat. Letting your mom drive might be awkward at first...but what 

isn't? 

1. If your date doesn't end well, you can always go home, pop in Star 

Wars, pull out your light saber, and Han Solo.

AVery Happy Un-Valentine's Day To You 



ByANDREWSTACKHOUSE 

Valentine's Day dawns upon a single person's 
morning with the weight of a metaphorical ele- 
phant. Everywhere they go, hearts, cupids and other 
annoyingly romantic symbols accost the senses, 
reminding them of their own singularity. However. 
instead of being depressed that evening, try some- 
thing new and invite some single friends over to 
have a thoroughly un-romantic movie party. Here 
are some movies that won't sicken your heart: 



Ocean's Thirteen - The 

stakes are a lot higher in this 
movie as well, as one of the origi- 
nal eleven thieves has been dou- 
ble-crossed by a vicious casino 
owner. Watch as the other ten, 
along with one of their old nem- 
eses, joins their ranks and make 
the greatest heist of all. 



The Brave One - jodie fos- 

ter plays a wife who takes the 
law into her own hands after she 
watches her fiance get murdered 
by thugs. This revenge flick cen- 
ters on Miss Foster's performance 
and truly depicts the sense of an- 
gry solitude the main character 
feels. 



The Bourne Ultimatum - 

The third Bourne movie features 
an even more intricate storyline 
and thrilling chase scenes. As 
with the other Bourne films, this 
movie is more than just an adren- 
aline-filled roller coaster ride. 
Expect moral and political ques- 
tions to surface throughout the 
movie as Bourne learns about his 
past and eludes the government. 



Michael Clayton - The 

truth can be adjusted" or so the 
tagline for the movie reads. The 
movie follows the intensive path 
of a lawyer who usually "fixes" 
dirty cases for his corporate cli- 
ents. When one of his fellow law- 
yers is killed he unearths a dark 
web of deceit that puts his own 
life (and morals) in danger. 



3:10 tO Yuma -This west- 
ern remake starring Russell 
Crowe and Christian Bale follows 
a smalltime rancher who gets 
paid to escort a captured outlaw 
to a train station. The action is 
intense in this movie, but the sto- 
ryline is also deep, insightful and 
thoroughly unromantic. 



The Invasion -This remake 

of Invasion of the Body Snatchers 
is an intense psychological thrill- 
er with an intriguing social com- 
mentary. The entire movie keeps 
you on the edge of your seat with 
it's creepy feel. The movie also 
features an amaazing cast that 
includes Nicole Kidman, Daniel 
Craig, and Jeremy Northam. 



Death PrOOf -This slasher 
flick of sorts is Quentin Tarantino's 
latest directorial achievement. 
The movie is talkie and a bit long 
at times, but the last thirty min- 
utes are pure adrenaline rush. 



ThisWeekln 



From Page 6 



The first 

opened with a longing 
melody. Very much like 
Smetana's Ma Vlast, this 
movement wandered 
through the strings, 
new waves of sound 
surging forth as the 
melody changed then 
ended with tragic, mi- 
nor chords. The second 
movement incorporat- 
ed string pizzicato in a 
somber tune. A fugue- 



like passage stomped 
through the move- 
ment, only to melt into 

dark sweeping tones 
and a high note at the 
close. 

The third move- 
ment was snappy, 
blasting the first notes 
wide open. Beginning 
like a march, the main 
musical thought sud- 
denly switched moods 
back to the seagoing 
roll of the first move- 
ment, gaining the fla- 
vor of the cinema mu- 



sic behind the Pirates 
of the Caribbean. The 
fourth movement includ- 
ed a brass and woodwind 
fanfare, a flute solo and 
noisy syncopations. 

The entire work ex- 
uded a romantic flair: 
sweeping from brooding 
themes to triumphant 
jaunts; it was a lovely way 
to end the concert. Audi- 
ence response was warm 
for this terrific display of 
musicianship. Conduc- 
tor Edvard Tchivzhel re- 
ceived two bows. 



Pan's Labyrinth -Director 

Guillermo del Toro's dark fantasy 
about a girl who learns about her 
mythical past is both mesmer- 
izing and disturbing. The visuals 
are awesome and the plotiine is 
intense. This isn't your average 
fairytale... and There are no princ- 
es to be found.

"Gypsy Fires" Lights Up the Philharmonic 




By LOUISA DANIELSON 

danilaOJeipfw.cdi; 



Saturday, February 
2 at 8 pm - the Fort 
Wayne Philharmonic 
performed "Gypsy Fire" 
with Hungarian solo- 
ist Barnabas Kelemen. 
The concert included 
works by Bela Bartok 
and lohannes Brahms. 

Kelemen opened the 



concert with the tech- 
nically difficult Bartok 
Concerto No. 2 for vio- 
lin. Composed of three 
movements, this work 
showcased Kelemen's 
fantasticabilitywithglis- 
sandos, trills and rapid 
bowing. The work was 
originally performed 
in 1939; its composer 
(also a Hungarian] had 
a fascination with the 



mathematical aspects 
of music, preferring to 
compose structurally 
accurate pieces rather 
than melodic. This was 
especially evident when 
the soloist did a duet 
with the timpani in the 
second movement, and 
when the orchestra 
spiraled ever higher in 
mysterious trills, like 
electronic toy space 



blasters. 

Kelemen received 
tremendous applause 
and a standing ovation 
for his rendition of the 
concerto. Following 
three bows, he left the 
stage in a swirl of black 
frock coat and silver 
cummerbund and van- 
ished behind the scrim. 

The next piece of the 
evening was Brahms' 



Symphony no. 4 in E 
minor op. 98. This piece 
was an example of pure 
music, composed for 
the benefit of both the 
listener and the per- 
former. The orchestra 
did a wonderful job with 
smooth transitions, cre- 
ating an idyllic panora- 
ma of sound on which 
to paint the thoughts of 
the listeners.

A History of Valentine's Day 

February 14 is a day that has been taken over by Valentine's Day cards, chocolate, flowers, and stuffed animals. 

The commercialism of Valentine's day has perhaps obscured the meaning and history of the holiday, so here are 

a few anecdotes to commemorate exactly what this holiday is all about.

Claudius II, 
who isalso known 
as "Claudius the

lieved that the 
best army was 
formed from 
single soldiers, 
instead of men 
with a wife and 
children. With 
that thought he 
banned all sin- 
gle men at that 
time from get- 
ting married. 

Saint Valen-

raged with this 
ruling and decided that 
he was not going to obey 
this law. He and another 
priest secretly continued 




While in jail, Saint 
Valentine became 

friends with the jailer's 
daughter. She would

and call to Saint

During the middle ages, 
young men and women 
would pick the name 
of their Valentine from 
a bowl, and then they 
would wear that name on 
their sleeve for a week. 
That is where the phrase 
"wearing your heart on

A phone vibrates. Two 
text messages emanate 
from a puny screen. 

A friend has sent 
plans about the upcom-

sor has sent a reminder 
about an assignment due 
Monday. 

With Blackboard Inc.'s 
acquisition of mobile 
messaging group NTi, 
this scenario could be- 
come a reality. 

Blackboard bought 
NTI for a reported $182 
million with aims of in- 
creasing its users and 
its capabilities in mass 
communications. 

"We also see tremen- 
dous potential for excit- 
ing applications of the 
technology," Peter Se- 
gal!, the president North 
America Higher Educa- 
tion and Operations, 
Blackboard, wrote in an 
e-mail. 

In the future, Segall 
said, students may be 



able to choose how to 
receive grades or assign- 
ments via text message, 
e-mail or even a phone 
call. 

Blackboard will ex- 
plore integration pos- 
sibilities for NTI group's 
Connect-ED with Black- 
board Academic Suite. 

Blackboard Academ- 
ic Suite offers online 
course management for 
students' grades and as- 
signments in addition to 
offering communication 
options between faculty 
members and students. 

The service Connect- 
ED, under NTI, powers 
enrollment communica- 
tions, financial aid no- 
tices, first-year student 
outreach and incident 
awareness to text- receiv- 
ing devices such as cell 
phones. 

"Tune-sensitive mass 
notifications systems 
are a top priority for aca- 
demic institutions to- 
day," Segall said. 

Alert notification sys- 
tems have been a grow- 
ing concern since the 
VirginiaTech shooting.

Exit of Bob Knight a major 
loss to all of college sports 



In All Directions 

By DAN VANCE 

dan.vanceefranchisepublications.net 

There have been a lot of major losses 
in the sports world as of late. There 
have been even more big stories. 

But nothing that the grand steroid 
drama could produce would be lead in 
my mind now that college basketball is 
wit Ik i nt Bob Knight. 

I love basketball. I love basketball 
in the state of Indiana. But, I have 
never been a fan of Indiana University 
basketball. Likewise, I cannot really say 
that I have ever been real fond of Bob 
Knight at any point in my life. 

But even as critical as I can be, I 
must say that the face of college sports 
(no jusi basketball) would not be the 
same without Knight. He has become 
one of a handful of always familiar 
faces on the scene of the NCAA's most 
profitable sport. Like Adolf Rupp, 
John Wooden and Dean Smith before 
him, Bob Knight has left his chosen 
profession a little less full because his 
bigtime personality and spirit will no 
longer be on the sidelines. 

He has also contributed to other 
big names. If there was no Bob Knight, 
there would be no Mike Krzyz'ewski 
and possibly no Duke dynasty. And as 
a longtime Blue Devil fanatic, 1 cannot 
imagine life without Coach K. 

And without Bob Knight, today 



would not be "Pat Knight Day" in 
Lubbock, Texas. And WHAT would life 
be like without that? 

First, note the sarcasm in the 
previous paragraph. And now, let's 
move on. 

Through 902 wins, Knight has done 
some tremendous things. None more 
so than coaching the last undefeated 
college basketball team to a national 
title in 1976. 

When he was fired from Indiana 
University in 2000 after a questionable 
(for lack of a better, non-profain word) 
decision by then-AD Miles Brand, 
the Knight legacy could have folded. 
Instead, it got a new life in the form of 
the Texas Tech Red Raiders. 

Knight was quoted in the press 
conference to announce his Texas 
Tech hiring as saying "this is by far 
the most comfortable red sweater I 
have worn in years." It was also the 
most comfortable the often enraged, 
sometimes downright cranky, coach 
had looked in years. 

It was sad to see that comfort 
starting to slip away this season and 
last. You could tell that Knight's end 
was coming. 

But that does not make it any 
easier. Bobby Knight has been college 
basketball for a long time. And sports 
history should recognize that because 
February 4, 2008 will go down as the 
day that sports changed forever. 



Up and down week for women's tennis 

The women's tennis team posted a 
very up and down week, coming out 
with only one win in Tor attempts. 

On Friday, the ladies split their 
afternoon, falling to Wisconsin- 
Milwaukee, but toppling Wisconsin- 
Green Bay, both of the Horizon 
League. 

The weekend also saw them post 
losses to Akron and Dayton. 

But showing a good ray of light 
was Ashley Recht, who was named the 
Summit League Female Athlete of the 
Month. 

Recht gamers Women's Athlete 
of the Month accolades after going 
undefeated during the month of 
January. The freshman posted a 3-0 
record at No. 1 singles, taking all of 
her matches in straight sets. She and 
partner Sachi Janek also went 3-0 at 
No. 2 doubles during the month. 

In a loss to Evansvillc, Recht was the 
only IPFW player to record a singles 
victory. Against Cleveland State, she 
was one of two Mastodons to post 



singles wins. The Summit League 
Athlete of the Week for Jan. 29, Recht is 
a perfect 7-0 on the year. 

Recht is the first IPFW student- 
athlete to be given this award. 

In their only win of the week, Recht 
continued her dominance at No. I 
singles with a 6-1, 6-3 win over Emily 
Lawent. 

Senior Ashley Coulson rolled to her 
third straight win at No. 2 singles, 6-0, 
6-4 against Kelly Stadum. 

Senior Hanna Hager gutted out a 
tough three-setter with Calle Conda, 6- 
2,4-6, 10-8. 

Unlike earlier in the day against 
UW-Milwaukee. JPFW started off the 
match winning the doubles point. 
The Mastodons won all three doubles 
matches. 

Recht did drop one match over the 
weekend to fall to 7-1 on the year. IPFW 
is now 3-5 and will return to action this 
Friday against Niagara and Eastern 
Illinois at home.

The Penn State Nittany Lions 
lived up to their ranking and rep- 
utation tonight. No. 2 PSU easily 
swept No. 10 IPFW, 3-0 at Alumni 
Hall. 

Penn State dispatched the 
Mastodons in quick fashion, 30- 
20,30-22, and 30-20. 

The win was the Nittany Lions' 
12th straight to begin the season 
(12-0). 

PSU was led by the trio of Matt 
Anderson, Ryan Sweitzer, and Max 
Holt with 16, 15, and 10 kills, re- 
spectively. 

Penn State dominated the net, 
outblocking IPFW 9.0 to 3.0. 

IPFW managed just one player 
in double-digit (alls. Senior out- 
side hitter C.J. Macias put down 12 
balls. 



The loss breaks a five-game 
winning streak for the Mastodons. 

The Saint Francis Red Flash 
already have one victory over a 
ranked opponent on their resume 
this season, knocking off No. 12 
George Mason. The Red Flash 
nearly got their second tonight in 
Loretto, Pennsylvania, but IPFW 
had enough at the finish to pull 
out the match, 3-2. 

The Mastodons won by the 
scores of 30-20, 30-21, 27-30, 25- 
30, and 15-11. 

IPFW cruised in the first two 
sets, hitting .562 and .375, respec- 
tively. The Red Flash didn't put up 
much of a struggle in those sets, 
hitting .074 and. 103. 

Saint Francis came out firing in 
the third set as sophomore outside 
hitter Nick Rivett put down a pair 
of kills to open up a, 7-3 lead. 



IPFW battled back to tie the 
game a number of times, includ- 
ing 26-all off of a pair of kills from 
Macias. Saint Francis would put 
game three on ice with kills from 
sophomores Jordan Varee and 
Patrick McManaman. 

Game four again was a close af- 
fair, but after a tie at 23-all, the Red 
Flash went on a 7-3 run, finishing 
it out on another Riven kill. IPFW 
regrouped in game five, taking a 
5-2 lead on a kill by senior middle 
Josh Stewart. 

Varee got Saint Francis to with- 
in two at 11-9, but the 'Dons could 
see the finish line, and ended the 
2:10 match on the final of Macias' 
match-high 20 kills. 

Senior opposite Jason Yhost 
had 14 kills. Stewart added lOand- 
nine blocks in the match (3 solo/6 
assists).

Oral Roberts University dominated all facets 
of play Saturday night, moving to 12-0 in Summit 
League action with an, 88-56 win over IPFW at the 
Mabee Center. 

ORU senior guard/forward Moses Ehambe was 
too much for the Mastodons to handle, pouring in a 
game-high 21 points, including three triples. 

The Golden Eagles exploded out of the gate with a 
13-2 run, putting the 'Dons behind the eight ball with 
just over six minutes gone. 

Oral Roberts pushed that lead to 17 on a layup by 
Ehambe and went to the break up, 44-24. 

At the beginning of the second half, IPFW cut 
the lead back to 13 on a 3-pointer by 
freshman guard Ben Botts. 

Unfortunately for IPFW, every time 
they made a run. ORU had an answer, 
lunior guard Robert Jarvis knocked 
down at triple of his own, increasing 
the Golden Eagles lead to, 59-35. 

ORU led by as many as 35 before 
winning the game by 32. 

Ehambe led four Golden Eagles in 
double-digit scoring. Jarvis chipped 
in 15. 

Botts was team-high for IPFW with 
13. Juniorguard jakari Johnson tossed 
in 11 points while senior forward 
Jaraun Burrows added 10. 

OralRoberts(17-5, 12-0) controlled 
the glass, outrebounding IPFW, 43-26. 

IPFW, who uses the three-pointer as a weapon, 
could only manage one on the evening, and the 'Dons 
turned the ball over 20 times. 

The loss snapped IPFW's three-game winning 
streak and dropped them to 10-14, 7-6 in the Summit 




J.JOHNSON 



Before the loss, IPFW topped Centenary 65-44 in a 
visit to Shreveport, Louisiana. DeWitt Scott and David 
Carson had 13 points each to lead the Mastodons.

in the win.
