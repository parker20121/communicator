Stadium favored 



The student senate, in September, 
voted unanimously nol lo support a 
baseball stadium being proposed by the 
Allen County Commissioners for land 
currently leased tn IPPW. 

That resolution stated that future 
growth and building needs cannot be 
specifically determined years in ad- 
vance. The senate then changed its 
collective mind Jan. 10 supporting the 
stadium. 

It seems the senate is going with 
whatever the popular opinion of the day 
happens lo be. 

In this space on Oct. 6, The Com- 
municator endorsed the idea of a 
stadium being built on land across the 
river from Ihe campus What took the 
senate so long? 

The senators seemed to be afraid that 
ihe IPFW Foundation would blindly give 
the land lo the county. The senators 
should have had the insight to at least 
call an the foundation to negotiate with 
the county before any land is turned 

The senate would like the following 
guidelines met before any land is turned 
r to the county: 



— IPFW students will have first 
priority For any jobs available at the 
stadium. 

— The design and development of the 
building must be compatible with 
university design and architecture. 

— All parking Tees for any events be 
lifted for IPFW students 

— University officials and other 
designees, in cooperation with Students' 
government, choose the official 
nickname of the stadium. 

— Ail IPFW activity card holders 
receive discounts at all stadium evenls. 

All of these guidelines are worthy, 
particularly (he -jobs," parking 1 'and 
discounts. However, does the senate 
want a red- brick stadium? Several 
members of students' government say 
they want people lo associate the sta- 
dium as being IPFW's and nol the 
Coliseum's. 

As far as an official nickname goes, 
what do they mean? In Detroit, Tiger 
Stadium is the official name of the 
stadium, nol a nickname. Surely 
Mastodon Stadium would be a nice name 
or how about Tusker Field?
