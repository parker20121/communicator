I-PU COMMUNICATOR 



To The Editor 



Dear Editor: 

A few points concerning a 
letter to the Editor In last 
week's Issue of your Illus- 
trious newspaper written 
by "Name Withheld By Re- 
quest". 

Mr. (or Ms.) Request 
seems to feel by his (or 
her) remarks, somewhat 
distraught over the plight 
of American society and the 
American working class In 
particular. Stating that the 
American working class 
has "less time for true 
leisure, less time for con- 
templation and , cultural 
activities, less time to re- 
ally enjoy the beauties of 
Nature, less time for true 
arts and crafts and family 
life than any other people 
In the modern or develop- 
ing world" the writer has 
shown himself (or herself) 
to be up to their ears in 
their own rhetorical dung. 
Psychological and Sociolo- 
gical studies have shown 
that one of the most ser- 
ious problems facing the 
working class is what to do 
with more leisure time not 
little or less leisure time. 
With today's five day 40 
hour workweek likely to be 
shortened to a four day 40 
hour (or, in some indus- 
tries a 36 hour) workweek, 
the laboring man will have 
a three day weekend, or, in 
other words an extra day of 
leisure time to spend. 
Speaking from an aesthetic 
standpoint, as far as "true" 
arts and crafts are con- 
cerned, sitting in front of 
the tube on Saturday after- 
noons watching football 
while consuming a case of 
Bud could be considered 
as cultural for "Joe Work- 
er" as reading Plato could 
be for someone else. 

Mr. (or Ms.) Request 
claims of the Soviet Union 
(that land of Journalistic 
"freedom" and Solzhenl- 
tsyn, hardly a compatible 
condition but there none the 
less) that, "All people 
share in the economic pro- 
gress of the country and the 
fruits of their labor." 
This may be true, but to 
have an equal share of little 
is not very much. The So- 
viet government has taken 
the "br eadba sket of 
Europe" which alone could 
feed Russia, and has arri- 
ved at a point where now 
a 1 1 of Russia cannot feed 
Russia. Last year we wit- 
nessed the 55th annual crop 
failure In the Soviet and, 
even with the massive Am- 
erican wheat shipments 
(surplus "produced by the 
repressed American work- 
ing class) arriving daily, 
next year will no doubt 
bring fonh the 56th annual 
crop failure. This has, I 
feel, something to do with 
the Soviet belief in Marx- 
ian certitude. 

Even in Cuba where "Am- 
erica hasdone everything it 
could short ofamilltaryat- 
tack to destroy it" Cuba 
lives on and on. In Cuba the 
sltpatlon was such that in 



order to finish harvesting 
the sugar crop, Premier 
Castro cancelled Christ- 
mas. This may be true, but 
to have an equal share of 
mas. This, however, still 
did not bring a crop any lar- 
ger thanlnpre-Castro 
time. Maybe Castro should 
take the initiative, exer- 
cise his cosmic powers and 
Just add an extra summer 
month at the years end. In- 
stead of just one extra har- 
vest day, they could have 
thirty-one extra harvest 
days. 
Mr. (or Ms.) Request's 
knowledge of his (or her) 
stated position is greatly 
wanting. Maybe that is why 
the writer refused to take 
credit for his (or her) art- 
icle. 

Stan Jones 

Dear Editor: 
Once again I find I must 
take issue with some of the 
assertions in Stan Jones' 
latest commentary on the 
"Peace Movement". Mr. 
Jones attacks the move- 
ment by saying that It is 
hypocritlcal-that it pro- 
tests the U.S. Involvement 
in Indo China yet says no- 
thing about the violence be- 
ing done in the name of th^ 
North Vietnamese. I will 
grant to Mr. Jones the fact 
that on the surface many of 
the most vocal in the peace 
movement do seem to pos- 
sess a double standard of 
morality. Yet if Mr. Jones 
wculd take the time to deal 
in depth with this Issue (as 
well as the others he has 
covered in past editorials) 
Instead of taking up points 
which seem best suited for 
ad hominem arguementshe 
would find that many of the 
"double standard" types 
are only on the fringe of the 
real peace movement. As 
to those who have made 
worthwhile contributions to 
the movement yet still pos- 
sess this "duel ethic" one 
should easily see that what 
is being employed here in 
the case of the Vietnam 
conflict is the time worn 
notion of the "Just War 
Theory". The only differ- 
ence In the application of 
the theory is that the Unit- 
ed States is seen to be un- 
just in this case- a fact not 
easy to swallow by many 
Americans. I wonder if the 
challenge to the so easily 
assumed and (unfortunate- 
ly) unquestioned notion of 
America's moral right- 
eousness is really the rea- 
son Mr. Jones wrote his 
article. 

But beyond this Mr. Jones 
has failed to recognize that 
the past World War II his- 
tory of Southeast Asia re- 
veals beyond a shadow of a 
doubt that the great dis- 
rupture and destructive a- 
lien presence in this srea 
since 1945 has been not out- 
side Communist agitators 
but the military machines 
of the French and Ameri- 
cans. The unfortuante fact 



is that the U.S. conduct in 
the war, in terms of des- 
truction hasfaroutshadow- 
ed anything done by the op- 
position. While I personally 
agree that acts of violence 
should be condemned when- 
ever and where ever they 
occur, Mr. Jones disre- 
gards the fact that protest- 
ation of aggressive acts 
gravitate t o the side which 
is most responsible for ag- 
gression. I find very little 
worth in Mr. Jones asser- 
tions that the peace move- 
ment glorifies the actions 
of the North Vietnamese 
while cbndemning those of 
the U.S. It is unfortunate 
that peace movement peo- 
ple do not speak out again- 
st the actions of the North 
but that Is not because the 
movement embraces those 
actions "warmly" and 
"with both arms." Rather 
it is because It Is natural 
to protest the actions of 
those who are most respon- 
sible for destruction and 
killing. Protest directed a- 
gainst one side in a con- 
flict is not necessarily sup- 
port of the other. But Mr. 
Jones would have us be- 
lieve that, at least with the 
"Peace Movement", this is 
the case. 

Mr. Jones also overlooks 
the fact that as Americans 
we are responsible for the 
actions which are carried 
out in our name. The Peace 
movement is not so naive 
that itwants only to carry 
out protest for protest's 
sake, but rather there is al- 
so an open desire for the 
movement to be politically 
effective. Naturally enough 
one protests toward those 
one has the most chance of 
Influencing. If thepeace 
movement's protests have 
been against the actions of 
the U.S. at the expense of 
protest against the Nonh 
Vietnamese It is because 
we are in America not 
North Vietnam. As Amer- 
icans we are responsible 
for what Americans do, not 
what North Vietnamese do. 
Mr. Jones almost seems to 
imply that Americans will 
become responsible for 
their actions only after 
the North Vietnamese do. 
Throughout his article 
there seems to run the no- 
tion of "they're not doing 
such and such, so why 
should we?" Mr. Jones 
questions the consistency 



Jan&gt; 



of the "peace movement's" 
morality. I question the 
consistency of his notion 
of national responsibility. 

Thirdly, there are very 
responsible groups of peo- 
ple within the "peace 
movement" who have de- 
cried the violence on both 
sides of the Indo China con- 
flict. I need only refer Mr. 
Jones to the American 
Friends Service Commi- 
ttee's report entitled Peace 
In Vietnam. If Mr. Jones 
had done a little research 
into this group as well as 
others such as the Fellow- 
ship of Rexoncillatlon, War 
Resistors League, and 
Clergy and Laity Con- 
cerned he would not have 
been able to make his as- 
sertions so glibly. 
There remains yet an- 
other problem. Mr. Jones 
obviously feels the U.S. 
presence in Vietnam has 
been Justified. And from all 
indications Mr. Jones also 
supports the way In which 
the war has been carried 
out in our name. After all 
if one is going to decry un- 
just actions one should de- 
cry them wherever they oc- 
cur. Mr. Jones complains 
that the "peace movement" 
does not do this. And yet 
neither does Mr. Jones. He 
protests the actions of the 
North Vietnamese, yet says 
nothing about the actions of 
the United States. Does Mr. 
Jones claim that there have 
never been or are now act- 
ions of the United States in 
Vietnam which are unjust? 
He Is amazingly silent on 
this point. Is that because 
he feels that no matter what 
the United States does in 
order to stem the "injust- 
ice" of the other side such 
action is always "Just- 
ified?" Have we In the his- 
tory of the war never step- 
ped beyond the limits of 
"justified" actions (even 
if we assume our presence 
as morally correct)? 
It would seem that Mr. 
Jones is as Inconsistent 
in hismoralltyasheclaims 
the "peace movement" Is 
In its own, since he seems 
to be unwilling to apply 
a standard of judgement 
to himself which he would 
impose on others. 
Last of all Mr. Jones ac- 
cuses the "peace move- 
ment" with the use of fraud 
and the distonion of facts 
in order to win people to

its cause, w. 
this is true I- 
gullty of what he - 
Mr. Jones refers to ttm...- 
c idnet at Hue in order to 
show that the peace move- 
ment Is inconsistent be- 
cause they do not protest 
what tool place there. He 
refers to the 3.000 Viet- 
namese civilians wh o were 
eliminated by the Viet Cong. 
But Mr. Jones again fails 
to note the facts. During the 
1968 Tet offensive Hue was 
held by Viet Cong and North 
Vietnamese troops for 
three weeks, and was cap- 
tured by U.S. marines In 
severe fighting. While the 
former chief information 
officer of the Saigon re- 
geime claimed that the In- 
habitants of Hue were kill- 
ed by the Viet Cong he was 
covering up the fact that 
many of the victims were 
killed by American bomb- 
ings and buried In mass 
graves. Some executions 
did take place but many of 
those executed were mem- 
bers of the police and se- 
cret police, not innocent 
civilians as the admin- 
istration claims. According 
to the director of Hue's 
special police, the VC bro- 
ught a list of all the "en- 
emies of the people" into 
the Gia Hoi area of Hue. 
Gla Hoi consists of 25,000 
residents. The list consist- 
ed of five names. What Is 
clear is tha most of the dead 
at Hue were killed during 
the massive U.S. bombard- 
ments during the climax of 
an extremely hard fought 
battle. They did not occur 
after a cease fire. 
While Mr. Jones may be 
able to bring forth lists of 
"atrocities" carried out by 
our "enemies", he fails to 
come to grips with the 
question as to whether 
those atrocities would have 
occured If not for the pre- 
sence of U.S. troops in 
Vietnam? The preoccupa- 
tions of U.S. policy have ne- 
ver been with those of the 
majority of Vietnamese, 
rather they have been a 
program based primarily 
on the needs of America's 
antl-C mm u ni St foreign 
policy. Again I must reiter- 
ate that the great disrup- 
tive and destructive alien 
presence in Southeast A- 
sia has been, not outside 
Communist agitators, but 
the war machines of the 
French and Americans. 
Sometimes I marvel at 
Mr. Jones' humanitarian 
concern. It is very easy to 
pass judgement on a group 
of people and dismiss them 
as out of hand. Sometimes 
this is necessary and pro- 
per. But the way Mr. Jones 
has been doing this in the 
past and present often 
makes me wonder whether 
his judgements show a real 
concern for justice in the 
world or whether they are 
merely attempts to attain 
a status of moral purity 
for himself. The way Mr. 
Jones so easily applies tit- 
les like "sanctimonious", 
"charlatanism" makes me 
suspicious that he projects 
such titles on his opponents 
so that he won't have to deal 
with them in himself.

ABORTION 



"We hold these truths to 
be self-evident: That all 
men are created equal; that 
they are endowed by their 
creator with certain Inali- 
enable rights; that among 
these are life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness*. 
If you agree with this fa- 
mous segment of the Dec- 
laration of Independence, 
you cannot be In favor of 
legalized abortion. If you 
are, then you obviously 
cannot agree with or do not 
understand what the afor 
mentioned statement says. 
Monday, the Supreme 
Court granted American 
women the right to have 
medical abortions during 
the first six months of 
pregnancy. Ironically, the 
state may only interfere 
with this "right of privacy" 
during the last three 
months when the unborn 
child is developed enough 
"to live outside of the mo- 
ther." The Court evident- 
ly believes that until the 
unborn child is capable of 
living outside the mother 
it is not "human". How- 
ever, Webster's dictionary 
seems to create conflict in 
the very definition of the 
word "abortion". It states, 
"abortion is the expulsion 
of the human fetus prema- 
turely". Therefore, expul- 
sion of an unborn child dur- 
ing the first six months is 
prevention or termination 
of that childs'life, orasthe 
Declaration would imply. 



It's Constitutionality 

"right to life". It may have 
been beneficial for the Jus- 
tices to have read the Dec- . 
laration of Independence 
before they toolc action. 
This country, as a result 
of our society, has the uni- 
que quality of reading only 
what it wants, and changing 
definitions of terms In or- 
der to satisfy the desires 
or actions of the few. In 
this case it was nine Su- 
preme Court Justices, a 
model example of what is 
Icnown as the "power elite". 
It would seem logical that 
the Supreme Court would 
act similarly to the be- 
liefs of most of the Amer- 
ican people. Didn't they 
hear that both states that 
had the abortion referen- 
dum on the ballot during 
the election defeated it by 
voting against legalized a- 
bortlon? And to thlnlc that 
these men are appointed 
for life I What the hell hap- 
pened to the system of 
checks and balances? 
Someone had better start 
"checlcing" or "balan- 
cing" the Supreme Court 
because they have already 
destroyed one or our "In- 
alienable rights," the right 
to live. Liberty and the pur- 
suit of happiness are next. 
Maybe when these ri ght s 
are infringed upon people 
win start to give a damn a- 
bout what the Supreme 
Coun can and cannot do.

From the President's desk 

by Brock Able 



Fellow students. If you 
have been wondering what 
your Students' Government 
is doing I can only say we 
are fighting for our uni- 
versity. As some of you 
may or maynot know, there 
Is a State Senator by the 
name of Gene Snowden from 
Huntington. This kind gen- 
tleman suggests that Ind- 
iana-Purdue at Fort Wayne 
should become a feeder for 
the main campuses. Now, 
this bothers me a little. 
Possibly if you would think 
about it you would become 
disturbed also. I wrote let- 
ters to the editors of the 
Fort Wayne Newspaper 
saying my thoughts on this 
matter. I would hope that 
some of you Huntington 
people would express your 
thoughts In writing and send 
them to the good Senator 
Snowden. 

Last week In my column 
I said that I would go out 
and talk with the students. 
This I have been doingand 
I have recieved some good 
feedback. There is one 
point that I want to elab- 
orate on. The Students' 
Government represents all 
of the students. However, 
what many students do not 
realize Is chat the Students' 



Government consists of 
maybe twenty to thirty stu- 
dents. These students are 
very busy with their duties, 
classes, and extra 
activities. Now, many mar- 
ried students are Interested 
In a campus day care cent- 
er. So am I, but, we are 
busy. What we need are stu- 
dents, preferably students 
who are interested In a day 
care center. 

In fact, we need people 
In all areas of the Stu- 
dents' Government. The 
Student Union Board has 
five vacancies that need to 
be filled. We constantly 
have projects that are shot 
down because of a lack of 
active people to do t h e 
work. In short we need you. 
If you are Interested come 
In and see us.

Anger Is an opposition to 
a given situation. Circum- 
stances arise which we po- 
sit as that-to-which-we- 
should - be - angry. Some- 
thing attacks and we engage 
It; but our engagement Is In 
an emotive way, a way 
v/hich attempts to trans- 
form the situation into 
something for us. 
Bitterness seems to have 
In It a resolve; nothing Is 
left. Anger that was once 
directed toward the situa- 
tion now bounds back upon 
us. In anger we are faced 
with our strength to op- 
pose the situation. In bit- 
terness, we concentrate u- 
pon our weakness, our 
helplessness In the face of 
the situation. But in both, 
we can jet in touch with 
ourselves. Is not weak- 
ness merely the limits of 
our strengths? Can we, 
then, know our strength 
without knowing our weak- 
ness? But we must ask. in 
what ways is our anger, es- 
pecially our bitterness, 
destructive of the ends we 
seek? 
To be honest with our- 
selves, we must "own," 
be responsible for our feel- 
ings and actions. But at the 
same time, we must realize 
that we are solely respon- 
sible for their conseq- 
ences.

On Love 

Love as something which 
we have In our head, some- 
thing we "feel" inside, 
makes no sense. If this 
were the case, how could 
we ever share it? No, 
love is something that we 
do. To the extent It Is 
seen as something "In- 
side" it becomes hateful 
and deceiving. How much 
hateful and deceiving 
"love" do we know t:day? 
Passions? Only our act- 
ing towards, our defining 
01 not defining, our words 
to, our silence for tte o- 
ther makes passionate 
"feelings" possible. Sub- 
stituting feeling for ction 
Is self deceit. Dema idlng 
the other's feelings a.id/or 
actions is arrogant. Look- 
ing for exclusivity Is ..lur- 
der. Self-hatred Is death.

Tn Resentment 
We resent things; we re-

'lon of a lack of creatl- 
ity. We resent some- 
'ling when it seems to be 
npo: Ing on our "rights," 
ur "freedom." We have 
10 rights. We can be free 
nly when we assert it, 
jrasp It, live It. How can 
anything be an imposi on, 
except when we name as 
such? Why would we n ne 
it as sucli except that we 
can no longer claim our 
self-hood? 
Some of us have been 
taught that we have no self- 
hood in the first place, 
e.g. women, children, 
businessmen /women, stu- 
dents, soldiers. Should we 
resent our teachers? On 
the contrary, we should 
laugh at their myths and 



our lives. 

Amidst the plenitude of 
human experiences, anger 
and joy seem to be the 
two moods most common- 
ly expressed. When we are 
"full of joy," we see the 
world as fresh and new. 
What of anger? what Is 
this thing called anger? 

Anger Is a mood, a state 
of mind. Perhaps to un- 
derstand anger It Is neces- 
sary that we first explore 
moods. Within all ranges 
of understanding, know- 
ledge, and perception, we 
are always and already in 
a particular state of mind. 
We are never without 
moods. Thus, even the at- 
tempt to understand any 
given situation demands 
that we first have an un- 
derstanding of moods. 
Every understanding has 
a j^iood; every mood, an 
understanding. 

I have been told that there 
are good moods and bad 
moods, Ihat there Is no 
reason to be always In a 
bad mjod, that being in a 
bad mood distorts reality. 
However, if bad moods are 
just as much a "mood" as 
good moods, then isn't It 
the case that good moods 
also equally distort real- 
ity? If we are always in 
some state oi mind, then 
what Is this "reality" that 
Is distorted? How can we 
know any "reality" beyond, 
11 we are continuously dis- 
torting it? within human 
experience. Is there no 
reality at all, or is the 
reality, rather, within the 
moods themselves? 



First, just as we are al- 
ways in a state of mind, 
we are always In a sit- 
uation with its own set of 
circumstances. Tradition- 
al psychological analyses 
argue that we become a 
state of mind because we 
are confronted by a given 
set of circumstances. Is 
this correct? Let'sassume 
this to ask: If I am dis- 
turbed (put in a bad mood) 
because of a given set of 
circumstances. Is it the 
factual circumstances 

themselves which disturb 
me, or 1« It the meaning 
those circumstances have 
for my existence or my 
goals? Obviously, It Is the 
meanings, for the circum- 
stances In themselves are 
nothing but inaffecting 
facts. It Is, then, the mean- 
ing of those facts, sup- 
posedly, which affect us. 
But where do the meanings 
the Interpretations of the 
facts, come from? From 
me. My goals, my dreams, 
my moods determine what 
any given situation will bo 
to me. Thus. It is not the 
case that I am In a mood 
because of a situation; on 
the contrary; i am In this 
situation because of the 
mood I'm in. 

What Is mood, then? It 
is not, as claimed, some- 
thing which overpowers us. 
but rather a way in which 
we face the world. It Is 
revelatory of the world we 
have constructed.

Don't spread It. 




It is through love and within love that we must lool for 
the deepening of our deepest self. In the llfe-glving c jm- 
Ing together of humankind. Love Is the free and Imagin- 
ative outpouring of the tpirit over all unexplored paths. 
It links those who love in bonds that unite but do nt 
confound, causing them to discover in their mutual 
contact an exaltation capable. Incomparably more thar 
any solitude, of arousing in the heart of their being al 
that they possess of uniqueness and creative power.

Letters To The Editor 

To the Editor; 

I must disagree with Mr. 
"Name Withheld by- 
Request, " the author of one 
of last week's letters to the 
editor. The American 
breed has more free time 
now than he ever had, pro- 
viding he doesn't have to 
work two or three jobs in 
order to maintain his silly 
luxuries. But, what free 
time that he has is spent 
In front of a television set. 

True, the Americans have 
made great progress in 
technical achievements. 
But, he has become a slave 
to these machines that he 
has created. The Ameri- 
cans have become totally 
dependent on machines to 
do their work for them. 
They have been inactive 
for sojlong that they are no 
longer capable of partici- 
pation In any form of art 
or recreational activity. 
This dependence on mach- 
ines has resulted in an e- 
conomic explosion, result- 
ing in higher prices for 
those whoare slave to these 
gadgets as well as those 
who are man enough to do 
without them.

Dear Editor: 

Once again I find I must 
take issue with some of the 
assertions In Stan Jones' 
latest commentary on the 
"Peace Movement". Mr. 
Jones attacks the move- 
ment by saying that it is 
hypocritlcal-t hat It pro- 
tests the U.S. Involvement 

in Indo China yet says no- 
thing about the violence be- 
ing done In the name of the 
North Vietnamese. I will 

grant to Mr, Jones the fact 
that on the surface many of 
Che most vocal in the peace 

movement do seem to pos- 
sess a double standard o/ 
morality. Yet if Mr. Jones 
would take the time to deal 
in depth with this issue (as 

well as the others he has 

covered in past editorials) 
instead of tak

I-PU COMMUNICATOR 

Karl Schweppe 

How free Is freedom? If 
you have totaled up all of 
the taxes that you pay in a 
years time, you would find 
that more than half of your 
annual Income is going to 
the government In one form 

or another. By the time that 

I totaled my state and fed- 
eral Income tax, sales tax, 
excise tax, various city and 
county taxes, my tax bill 
came to fifty-three per- 
cent of my annual income. 
This doesn't even Include 
hidden taxes such as those 
on transportation charges. 
Imported goods, or various 
cosmetic and drugitems. 

The amount that we have 
to pay isn't as disgusting 
as the paltry services that 
we receive. Wegetbigbea- 
utiful buildings, to be used 
by the political officials, 
who are another useless 
expenditure. We get a bunch 
of freeloaders who sit a- 
round and decide what fs 
proper for us to use and 
what isn't. We get the plea- 
sure of sendlnga man tothe 
moon to pick up useless 
rocks or to hit a golf ball. 
We get to go into another 
person's country and kill 
the inhabitants who live 
there. What we don't get Is 
what we need. We can't 
even get our roads main- 
tained or an effective law 
enforcement system. If we 
would pay only for what we 
receive, our taxes would 
be cut In half. 

If our present tax trend 
continues, we will be pay- 
ing $15,000 for each man, 
woman and child by the 
year 1980. This will result 
in an Increase of property 
loss for those who are un- 
able to pay an outrageous 
amount. Poverty and crime 
will increase, with the re- 
sult that our country will 
be destroyed. 

I feel that we have been 
supporting this non-func- 
tioning charity long enough. 
The only peaceful way to 
stop the unnecessary 
spending by our political 
playboys is to speak out 
against what they are do- 
ing. Write to every politi- 
cal officeholder that you 
know. Whether it is local, 
state or federal, they must 
know how the people feel 
about how their money is 
being squandered. The 
price of a few stamps and 
envelopes is small com- 
pared to that which we will 
pay through increased tax- 
es or property loss to the 
government. 

Whatis the price of free- 
dom? It could be a lot less 
than what we are paying 
now, and we should be get- 
ting much more for our mo- 
ney.
