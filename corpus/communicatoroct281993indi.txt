Students to perform dance to benefit 
Indian earthquake survivors 



by F. Lane Douse 
Editor In chief 

On Sept. 30, India was shaken by its 
worsl earthquake in (he past 50 years. 
Tens of thousands of lives were lost in 
Ibis natural disaster. 

However, help is on the way as mem- 
bers of IPFW's International Students 
Organization prepare for a fundraiser 
to be held this Saturday at 7 p.m. at 
Neff Recital Hall. 

"It's a catastrophe. It's a major disas- 
ter," Rajat Suri. student body president 
and ISO member, commented. 

Suri expressed appreciation of the 
chancellor and other campus commu- 
nity members for showing their con- 
cern for his family living in India. His 
family was not affecled by the earth- 

Arpana Lingaraj, a freshman major- 
ing in Speech and Audiology, and her 
sister Trupti Lingaraj, a student at 
Northrop High School, will be per- 
forming the native classical Indian 
dance bharathanatyam, in order to 
raise money that will be sent to the 
Prime Minisler's Relief fund in India. 

Commenting on her desire to perform 
for the relief effort, Arpana said, "It's 
nice lo know you can do something 
useful to help people in need." 



According to the official count, at 
least 32,000 lives were taken by Ibis 
earthquake. Some speculate that the 
death toll is much higher than official- 
ly reported. 

The last earthquake that devastated 
India bit on Oct. 20, 1991, at the 
foothills of the Himalayan mountains. 
Seven hundred and forty-four lives 
were lost in that quake, 

Suri and Arpana both stated that the 
earthquake is an additional setback Tor 
this particular area, which includes the 
cities of Killari, Umarga, Sholapur. 
Gulbarga, and Latur. because the resi- 
dents had just recovered from an on- 
going political crisis. 

Freshman Uruj Saeed. a Pakistani 
bom in Kuwait, can sympathize with 
the devastation and bard times to come 
because she faced similar devastation 
in Kuwait at the time of the Iraqi inva- 
sion. 

"'I sympathize with the victims. . . It is 
tragic and really sad. I would be glad 
to be of some help," said Saeed. 

The relief fundraiser will be held this 
Saturday at Neff Recital Hall at 7 p.m. 
Attendance is free. Donations will be 
accepted at the event and until Nov. 
20. Checks can be made payable to the 
International Student Organization and 
sent to Walb Memorial Union, Room 

118.

Student Senate discusses new guidelines 



Student Senate discussed adopting a 
new seven page document that would 
change the way student organizations 
receive monies for special events. 

Previously, the senate had no guide- 
lines outlining the budgetary allocations 
for student organizations' events. 
Instead, general rules of thumb have 



been passed down and inierpreted by 
the senate. 

The document specifies ibat requests 
for funding by special interest groups 
like the Black Collegian Caucus (BCC) 
and Fighting Ideaotogies Resistant lo 
Equality (FIRE) be presented lo Ihe sen- 
ate body and "not just lo four people 
deciding how $15,000 will be spent," 
according lo one senator. 

"There are two groups: campus-wide 



activity groups like PIT. Forensics and 
tbc Music Department and then, there 
are special inlercsl groups. The term 
'special interest group' came from the 
student service fee manual," explained 
Chris Douse, student senator, and one 
of three members of the Budget 
Committee who constructed the 
document. 
The guidelines will be voted on later. 
One senator emphazied the importance 



of bow monies will be budgeted differ- 
ently if the guidelines arc passed and 
wanls student organization representa- 
tives involved in this issue. 

"This is a very important document 
thai needs to be scrutinized, " added 
Douse. "It must be fair to both special 
interest groups and campus-wide activi- 
ties groups. I encourage student organi- 
zation representatives to come to Ihe 
hciuing and ask questions." 



Collegiate Fair motivates community adults 



by Anita Stelnbachcr 
Copy Editor 

College Anyone? Go For It! 

By 6 p.m. lasl Tuesday evening, there 
was hardly a parking space lo be found 
within a block of the Allen County 
Public Library (ACPL). Parking spaces 
were rilled by potential adult students 
and presenters of ihe Returning to 
Learning Adult College Fair. 

The Fair was co-sponsored by Inter- 
College Adult Network (ICAN) and the 
Adult &amp; Community Task Force of the 
Allen County Collaborative for 
Education from 3 to 8 p.m. that 
evening. 

Although it was u rather brisk, cool 
fall evening, the enthusiasm of Ihe 
attendees and presenters was not damj 



encd. As one Walked through the double 
doors of the entrance of Ihe ACPL, on 
the right hand side, tbe enthusiastic, 
cheerful faces of Linda Johnson, 
Coordinator of the Center for Women 
and Returning Adults of IPFW with her 
secretary, Lois Ketlercr could be seen 
seated behind a table set up with vari- 
ous materials greeting and providing 
information for people as they entered. 
Adults were asked lo fill out cards and 
handed materials. Parents with children 
in low were told about Ihe child care 
service available during the fair, cour- 
tesy of IVY TECH Cookies, coffee and 
vegetables with dip were provided cour- 
tesy of Taylor University and Saint 
Francis College. 

In the room to ihe right of the 
behind tbe tabic, several col- 



leges and universities were represented. 
There was also a small child care center 
that had been partitioned off for Ihe 
occasion, behind which children were 
playing contentedly . 

Charles Washington, the new 
Associate Director of Career 
Counseling was also present. 

IVY TECH, ITT, Lutheran College, 
Saint Frances College and several oth- 
ers as well, were also represented. 

From 3:30 p.m. on, 20 minute lo 45 
minute workshops wee presented 
upstairs, in continuous succession until 
8 p.m. with only 10 to 15 minute breaks 
between Ihcm. 

The workshops presented were, 
Gelling Started: Identify Your Dream; 
Taking Charge: Money Mailers; (pre- 
Careen: Choose Your 




Lois Ketterer. Lynn McKenna-Frazier end Linda Johnson look enthusiastic al Ihe Adult College fair 



Path; Employer Perspective: The Value 
oj Education in the Workplace; 
Juggling Family, Work and School; 
The Act of Having It All and Graduate 
School: A Reality. 

Juggling Family. Work and School: 
was very popular and attendees came 
from all walks of life, 

Sandra DeMoss, an Adult Psychology 
student from Taylor University stated, 
"I'm learning about me and I'm learn- 
ing about relationships around me." 

Fayc Lcamon, a Nursing student al 
Lutheran College reiterated DcMoss' 
advice, saying, "You have to be willing 
lo ask for help when you need it." 

Tammy Orta, a Practical Nursing stu- 
dent at IVY TECH. said that the best 
part about going back to school is lhat 
for the first time in bcr life she s doing 
something for herself. The worst part 
is, "not spending the lime I would like 
lo wilh my kids." a very common 
dilemma for Ihe "non-traditional" adull 
student. 

The general consensus wos, "If you 
are thinking of college - go for it! 
College is worth it It is really 
satisfying." 

The final workshop of Ihe day, 
Graduate School: A Reality, was sur- 
prisingly well attended by people. 
Dr. George Wood, Professor of 
Educational Leadership from Ball Stale 
University, mode a tremendous impres- 
sion on tbe attendees 
The seminar was still going strong 8 
p.m.. when parents had lo be reminded 
to pick up their children from the child 

Johnson was pleased with Ibc fair 
describing it as "wonderful!" 

It gave the universities and colleges in 
Ibc area a chance to interact positively 
together. The fair hod an excellent turn- 
out and was definitely worth attending, 



Mock trial produces 
a guilty verdict in case 



"Guilty!" That was the verdict of Ihe 
mock trial sponsored by the University 
:c and Safely Department and 
na-Purdue Student Government 
Association as a part of the Alcohol and 
Safety Awareness Week. 

The mock trial settled the mock acci- 
dent involving a drunk driver and the 
deaths of his two passengers earlier in 
the week. 

IPFW students Kamran Rao, a senior 
and Rajat Suri. also a senior, portrayed 
the two students involved in the mock 
accident. 

Everything felt real as soon as the 
police officers put the cuffs on me," 
Rao stated. 

Chris Douse and Jerry Richardson 

espectively serve as the defendant's 
lawyer and the prosecutor. 

Les Williams, one of IPSGA's Judicial 
Court judges, presides as the judge. 

vas really excited and happy to be 
given the chance to participate in Ihis 
octivity," said Williams. 

Six IPFW students served as the peer 
jury lhat delivered the guilty verdict. 
They were Melinda Williams, Mclanie 
De Vore, Ann Lehto, Kathy Halflich, 
Peter Parton, and KeroyAdkins. 



Tbc case was about a student driving 
drunk on campus who ends up getting 
into an accident thai results in the death 
of his friends. 

The prosecution side was to pTOve dial 
the student was under influence of alco- 
hol and above the legal limit at .18 
when Ihe accident occurred. 

The defense was lhat the student wa 
distracted and could noi be held liabli 
for the deaths of his friends because his 
blood alcohol level rendered him inca- 
pable of responsibility for his actions. 

'1 was very pleased wilh Ihe ouicome 
of ihe case. It was won on scientifu 
evidence," said Richardson, who won 
the case. 

However Ihe defense felt thai they 
tried to present Ihe best defense for die 
studeni according to Douse. 

After Ihe trial. Douse remained in 
character and said, "I felt that b( 
hoodwinked and bamboozled. We shall 
appeal this in the future." 

"Student turnout was very poor. I 
surprised and disoppoinled that very 
few students showed up to watch tht 
judicial process in action." said Kristii 
Schlundt, IPFW senior. 

Hopefully next year more people wil 
participate â€” we had a lot of fun trying 
to heckle the legal counsel about their 
professional attire, not lo mention the 
logic of their arguments. 



Campus safety issues 
addressed by administration 



Felicia Bccchlng 
News Editor and 

F. Lane Douse 

Editor Id chief 

During IPSGA's second Open Forum 
last Wednesday, several IPFW adminis- 
trators and approximately 50 students 
discussed 'campus safety,' which was 
the topic of the forum. The discussion 
included: campus entrances, ihe juris- 
diction of campus police, emergency 
telephones, lighted areas around cam- 
pus. and several other topics. 

Rajat Suri. student body president, 
moderated the forum which included 
IPFW administrators Donald R. Katter, 
physical plant director; Walter J 
Branson, vice chancellor of financial 
affairs; Lauren D. DcnHortog, chief of 
university police and safety. Jack C. 
Dab.), registrar and associate vice chan- 
cellor of planning: Gregpry L. Callcn, 
director of student affairs, and David L. 



Lccka, assistant comptrollei 

Several students expressed disap- 
proval of the fact that they hod seen 
campus police on the U.S. 30 Bypass 
watching traffic instead of. in their 
opinion, taking care of campus needs. 

"IPFW police are Fort Wayne City 
police and under city-wide jurisdiction. 
At times, Ibey (campus police] are 
needed to assist tbem [the Fort Wayne 
City police]," said Denllartog. 

Students also asked about the safety of 
Ihe entrances into the campus. Traffic is 
often congested, the students noted, 
especially ul tbc Coliseum Boulevard 



Katter asked ihe students to try the 
new entrance into Ihe campus from 
Crescent Avenue. Tbe Indiana 
Department of Transportation designed 
ibc entronce to make it eosier to lum 
left from Coliseum Boulevard and left 
again at the new entrance.

Smokers around 
Kettler sent 'packing' 
again 



Wc heard your pica, and we look 
action. You wanted campus build- 
ings to be free of smoke. All of ihc 
buildings on campus arc smoke 
free with the exception of the lower 
level of the Walb Memorial Union, 
What more do you want? 

In a recent letter to the editor. 
Dartayna Porch wrote about how 
/as disgusted with the smoking 
outside of Kettler. She said that 
when she exited the building, she 
was engulfed with smoke fumes. 

If they don't smoke there, where 
are they supposed lo go? If we 
,ke the campus smoke free, 
aren't we infringing upon the rights 
of Ihc individuals who smoke? 
Individual rights and civil liberties 
are what this country is based upon. 
If we take away our rights, what do 
have left. 

Granted, the Surgeon General 
reports have proved that smoking is 
hazardous to your health. Smoking 



makes your lungs filled with tar, 
your teeth yellow and your life 
shorter. But voicing opinions about 
this issue has become an everyday 
occurance. Why is there such a 
need? The smokers already know 
all of this. And as a result, many 
smokers have become non-smok- 
ers. 

Yet the world is not completely 
smoke free and we must realize 
that. We've gone so far as to make 
specific sectons in restaurants for 
the non-smokers, smoke free stores, 
hotels, even smoke free malls. It 
seems lo us that the non smokers 
arc the ones who have the freedom, 
not the smokers. 

Additionally, smokers should have 
just as many rights as anyone else. 
Ycl, We seem lo be taking them 
away, rather than helping them fix 
the habit The extra tax on tobacco 
is enough to send anyone packing 
up their habit.

Commentary

By now, we all have certainly heard 
that the Supreme Court is slated to hear 
Ihe cose thai pits a female employee of 
a Tennessee construction firm against 
bcr male employer. The case will be 
heard because it calls for yet another 
interpretation of the Civil Rigbls Act, 
which is intended (o promote equity in 
our society. 

What Ls an 'equitable' society? It is a 
society in which you and I have the 
same chance as the next person lo suc- 
ceed or to foil. 
I caught pari of a newscast aired last 
week on National Public Radio in 
which Ihe plaintiff in the case bravely 
read a written account of the misery she 
endured under the employ of the foul- 
mouthed and offensive defendant He 
habitually made crass, juvenile com- 
ments of a sexually suggestive nature to 
his female employees: for example, he 
often said that ihe women in his office 
should fish coins from his pants pockets 
or bend over to retrieve coins from the 
floor. Furthermore, he was fond of 
making personalized remarks to the 
plaintiff, such as, "If you wore a thong- 
back bikini to the beach, there would be 
a total eclipse of Ihe sun." 
I can't imagine that anyone could lis- 
ten to such a case without feeling sym- 
pathy for the plaintiff. Her employer 
abused bis authority. His behavior was 
lewd and disgusting. He was cruel and 
abusive toward the women in the office 
(particularly toward the plaintiff), and 
his actions, wiihout question, were 
deplorable. In short, the man behaved 



But the woman did not quit her job, 
confront her employer, nor get any sort 
of professional help for ber emotional 
duress. What she got was angry. She 
sued the man, She got even.. 

But the case proved a complicated

n the ci 



ntry. 



Allow me to pui die case into perspec- 
tive for you: here we have a woman 
seeking restitution from a man who 
harmed her emotionally. We can't 
blame the woman for going after him; 
after all, ber former employer hurt her 
feelings and damaged bcr self-esteem, 
and for that the plaintiff wants him to 
pay. So, this woman has taken him to 
court; that is, she has taken legal action 
to resolve a personal 



bavi 



: of s 



harassment. What we have here is a 
matter of injured feelings. It's not fair 
that wc hurt one another's feelings â€” 
that's not playing nice. 
But what are Ihc implications of taking 
a matter of injured feelings onto a legal 
balllc ground? Essentially, we arc try- 
ing a man for being asinine. Wc are 
calling it criminal to hurt another's feel- 
ings. We're making it illegal to be 

The Civil Rights Act serves lo protect

Letters to the editor 
A note from the editor 



As the editor in chief of The 

Communicator, I try to present boib 
sides of every issue. However, in the 
recent scries dealing with the sexual 
harassment charges filed against John 
Taylor, there were some inaccuracies 
which need to be clarified. 

Below is a fax Dr. Gerald L. Ratliff. 
dean of the IPFW School of Fine Arts, 
received last Friday from Dr. Andrew 
.Froclich, chair of the North Dakota 
State University music department. He 
staled that The Communicator bad 
wrongly identified Dr. Robert 
Paltengale as the chair of the NDSU 
music department. 

Paltengale is the chair of the 
Moorhead State University music 
department. 

I called Paltengale to verify his posi- 
tion at Moorhead Stale University. 
Paltengale informed me that he is the 
chair of the Moorhead music depart- 
ment, not the NDSU music department. 

Pallcngalc also informed mc lhat he 
stood by his comments which were 
reported in last week's Communicator 



article regarding Taylor's unethical 
behavior. 

He also explained that North Dakota 
State University, Moorhead State 
University, and Concordia College are 
three different universities within close 
proximity of each other. 

These three universities joined togeth- 
er lo create an entity called the Tri- 
Coltcgc University which, as stated in 
the fax below, "enables students at one 
school to enroll in classes at either of 
,the other two institutions. . . ." This is 
what confused The Communicator 
reporter when identifying which univer- 
sity Dr. Robert Patiengale represent;. 

The Communicator interviewed 
Patiengale Uircc limes and tried lo con- 
tact Froclich twice during the month of 
September and a week before press 
time of last week's issue. 

Froclich did not respond. 

I hope (his clarification will allow 
people to form a more objective opin- 
ion on (his controversial issue,

Vou didn't hear it 
from me but. . . 




Chair supports Taylor 



Dear Editor, 

I have jusl read Ihe article by 
Felicia Beech ing regarding John 
Taylor in your sludenl newspaper. 
(I'm sorry Ihc dale of the arlicle 
was not included.) There are 
enough factual errors in the hrief 
article lo render it at best both 
ludicrous and worthless and at 
worsl, deceitful. 

The slalement "ihe university ai 
Fargo is three institutions on one 
campus" is not true. The Fargo- 
Moorhead area has three distinct 
colleges: North Dakola State 
University in Fargo; Concordia 
College in Moorhead; and 
Moorhead State University in 
Moorhead. There is an entity 
called the Tri-Collegc University 
which enables students at one 
school to enroll in classes at 
either of the Iwo other institutions 
for various reasons. (Such as the 
unavailability of a certain course 
alone university.) 

Robert Patiengale is the chair- 
man of the Moorhead State 
University music department and 
has never been a faculty member 



at NDSU. The lead sentence 
"Robert Paltengale, chair of the 
Music Department at ND State 
University" makes Ihe rest of the 
article rely on Pattengale's per- 
spective as a member of NDSU 
where Taylor was employed. This 
is a lie. As lo "taking two faculty 
members to TTU," I am personal- 
ly unaware of any faculty mem- 
ber who departed unwillingly 
from either Moorhead State or 
North Dakola Slate University. I 
would also presume that 
Tennessee Tech University has 
job search procedures which pre- 
clude a chairman from giving a 
job to a person based on friend- 
ship. 

I am sure lhat Dr. Patiengale. if 
contacted, will support what 1 
have said and I would be happy 
to have any oUier senior faculty at 
either institution corroborate 
where the truth lies in regard to 
this irresponsible writing. 

Sincerely, 

Dr. Andrew Froelich 
Professor and Coordinator 
Music Department NDSU

Whai's up! 1 hope you enjoyed last 
veck's issue of ihc Communicator. 
This was our second in-bouse issue. 
When I say in-house, I mean wc pro- 
duced the whole paper in our cozy lit- 
tle, office staying up until ihc cows 
came home. The only thing the print- 
did was print the paper. 
his is a new era for the 
Communicator. It is also very special 
because all of the equipment was 
bought by advertising profits and 
fundraising activities.. 
Now, I would be wrong if I did nol 
iddrcss the recent verdict of the 
Reginald Denny trial. So, let's gel 
down to work. 

First, we need to to examine the 
Reginald Denny trial. 
Was justice served? 
Well, if you ask me, I Ihlnk Justice 
was not served, but they made the 
right decision by finding them not 
guilty the same way they found the 
L.A. Four not guilty of police bru- 
tality. This 1 feci ls acceptable 
because both decisions were based 
&gt;n the color or someone's skin. 
Now, some people may say lhai this 
'icw is a racist or a prejudiced one. 
Lei's get this fact straight. African- 
Americans can not be racist by defini- 
tion because we do not possess the 
power to exclude or oppress people by 
s of the institutions of political, 
social, military and education because 
ibis power is in the hands of while 
folks, alright! However, we can have 
cc hate, prejudice, or bigotry, 
'his trial is a reflection of Ihe firs! 
al with Ihe LA. Four. If the so 
lied justice system would have 
found the first offenders, the police 
'filters, guilty of police brutality, this 
trial would have produced a verdict of 
guilty for the crimes they committed. 
However, because of this reoccurring 
thing called institutional racism, the 
first trial was a clear cut example of 
iiice and no peace for the L.A. 
riots followed quickly. 
After surviving the LA. riots, I feel 
the jurors did nol want to experience 
another riot. 



Damn, I hit a nerve because I know 
some people are thinking a guilty 
diet is not a reason to destroy other 
people's businesses or assault oi 
der someone. People have lo realize 
lhat the first riot wasn't just about the 
nol guilty verdict. It was a reaction 
African-Americans being irealed 
second class citizens for Ihc past 400 
years, including slavery. 

So. you simply bave lo see, t 
there were no racism, a verdi 
guilty would probably bave been 
delivered by the jurors. Howcv. 
because of racism and Ihe fear 
another riot, maybe worse than I 
previous one, jurors decided on mak- 
ing Ihe right decision to protect tbi 
lives of not only Ihe people of L.A. 
but the United Slates (I make such . 
broad statement because ihe riot in 
L.A. sparked some flare-ups through- 



it the ci 



ntry). 



I feel that if wc as people do 
begin to bridge the gap between Ihe 
races by Ihc year 2000, or at least 
begin to show a determined effort 
heal Hit wounds of the past, another 
isolated incident will flare up reactions 
around the United Stales in which 
many good people will die- 
How do we begin to solve this prob- 
lem? 

I was speaking lo one of my profes- 
sors and two friends on this subject. 
My professor began to lalk about bow 
while people need to realize thai if you 

"racist," There is nothing wrong with 
it. It's just a fact of life. 
If wc are African -American, we 
lo start looking at ourselves and a&lt; 
the fact lhal we have been taught lhal 

Once we realize those two thing: 
depend on our color, we then need lo 
start doing self-evaluation on oui 
belief system, questioning our founda- 
tion and determining if this is what 
we truly believe. 

Once wc determine what we believe, 
Ihc only thing wc have to do is prac- 
tice our beliefs in all aspects of our 
lives. 

It's nol easy. 

It's gonna be hard, but it may be the 
only way to have peace. 



Snyder defends the rights of smokers 



To the editor 
1 promised myself that 1 would not 
wnle any further letters defending Ihe 
rights of smokers, I resigned myself to 
the fact lhal I belonged lo minority 
whose civil liberties appeared inconse- 
quential lo tbc majority. I accepted the 
role of social pariah in this brave new 
world of correctness: political, spiritual, 
physical, emotional. I bave grown 
accustomed to receiving the worst 
tables in eateries, being banned from 
public events (many of which are sup- 
ported by the tax revenues from Ihe cig-

excluded from both public and private 
gatherings I have even, bcgrudgingly. 
acquiesced that my habit will subsidize 



the free health care of even non-smok- 
ers. 1 have been exiled lo doorways, 
loading docks, street comers and alley- 
ways lo enjoy my habit outside the con- 
fines of my borne. This I have done, 
more or less willingly, in Ihe name of 
protecting the civil liberties of non- 
smokers while still maintaining my 
legal right (thus far) to smoke in a free

even Ibis is nol enough and to quole 
from a movie of a few years back. "I'm 
mad as bell, and I'm not going to lake 
anymore." 
In last week's Communicator 
(10/21/93). Dartanya Poich in her letter 
to the editor, would now banish mc 
from smoking oul of doors. Il seems 



that I am polluting hÂ£i air! 'Ibis is the 
final straw. I will break my promise as I 
must respond. I will, instead, reply in as 
simple and direct a language as I am 
able. 

I was willing lo compromise my civil 
liberties for the sake of Ihc majority, but 
no morel Enough is cnoughl Dartanya, 
this may come as a shock to your infan- 
tile and pseudo-social sensibilities, but 
you do nol ycl own the damn air. If you 
do nol like having to share the air then 
grow gills and head for the sea. 
Meanwhile, you and all other anti- 
smoking zealots be warned: when you 
sec smokers in your path, find another 
path as we arc nol going lo give another 
inch. In fact, we might "just blow our hot 



in your face, as wc have certainly 
been receiving enough of yours, 
I, and olber smokers, are more than 
willing lo respect the rights of others 
and by so doing share this planel lhal 
we live on. You and your ilk are fascists 
who would share ihe planel with only 
those who think, act. believe, or behave 
as you and that, my oh-so cnligbtened 
and trendy Dartanya, is nol freedom or 
sharing, but enslavement, and 1 refuse 
to be enslaved or have my civil liberties 
imprisoned by anyone, regardless of 
bow supposedly noble their cause may 
be.

pices, by Paul moring, Photo Editor 





: How do you feel about the smoking 
policy on campus and where students are 
limited in their smoking areas? 




Tracey C leu r waters 

"I think that the smoking policy on 
campus is prclty fair (being a smoker 
myself). They already limit you to 
smoking outside where it doesn't butt 
anyone or bother anyone. What more 
could they do?" 




Jamty Chiiders 

"1 feci that the current policy is fine. 
Non-smokers bave just as many 
rights as smokers, and should be enti- 
tled to breate clean air." 







Stan Grodrian 

"The campus smoking policy is 
acceptable the way it is now. 
Restriction from the cafeteria, the last 
indoor place, would be very upsetting." 



EARN UP TO $10/ HOUR 



Motivated students needed for 
P/T marketing positions at your 
school. Flexible hours 



Jeff Garver 
"Even though I smoke I agree with, 
policy because I understand the non- 
smokers' point of view."

Aunt Louise helps the lovesick 




Dear Aunt Louise, 



I have a problem. I guess everyone 
who writes you has a problem of some 
sort. Well, Ibis one is aboul my rela- 
tionship with my boyfriend. We have 
become very close and I have realized 
that be is not the right person for me. 

Why is il that when I feel a certain 
way, the other person feels Ihe oppo- 
site because that is the case with ibis 

nan. He thinks the world of me and I 

im the only "woman" for him. 

Since I know that 1 kind of have a 
hard lime in deciding if I should break 
things off with him or not.. I am very 

nhappy because be is now pushing 
for us to become sexually active. I 
need help! 



I Don't Know What to Do! 



Dear I Don't Know What lo Do, 

Ob, dearie, this is a tough situation 
that you have gotten yourself into, now 
let's get you out. What you need lo do 
is be completely honest with him. 
Explain to him that your reelings 
extend only inlo the realm of a friend- 
ship and you can't give him what he 
needs... which is a girlfriend. 

You should assure him thai you two 
will always be friends because it is 
important to always have good rela- 
tions with your ex-boyfriends. 

Now as far as (be sex part, honey, 
you're going lo have to stale it directly 
to him that you do not find him sexual- 
ly attractive, if that's the case. You also 
need lo let him know thai no sexual 
activity will lake place between you 
two at all. 



Your loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

I like this guy and I find bim very 
attractive. I just don't know what to do 
Every lime I sec him on campus I gel 
sick to my stomach. He doesn't even 
know that 1 am alive. What should I 
do? 



Dear Lost in Lovi 

It sounds like lo me that you have a 
bad case of love sickness. It happens to 
people all of the time You need to 
look at the situation for what it is. 

Now. if'it was during my time. I 
would tell you to wail until be makes 
Ihe first move. However, these arc the 
nineties and I understand that men do 
not always make the first move, 
Sugarplum, don't handle this like 
you're some poor lovesick, homely 
type young lady in high school. You 
need to lake action! 

You have two choices: remain unseen 

I suggest you make yourself known. 
Ask this person out for a cup of coffee. 
Depending upon if you smoke or not, 
why don't you ask him for a cigarette 
if you sec him puffing outside one of 
the buildings? 

Any which way, you want to let him 
know that you arc available and inter- 
ested. Most men should find this flat- 
tering, If he doesn't find you attractive 
he will let you know. 

Then you need to realize Ibat he just 
wasn't (he right one. If that's the case, 
just go on with your life and keep your 
little heart open because love will find 
ils way home. 



Your loving Aunt Lo

ality. The Campus Ministry meets bi- 
weekly but also hosts and participates 
in other activities. 

Officers for Ihis year's Campus Life 
arc President Jeremy Kaylor, Vice- 
President Any Krach and Secretary 
Laura Agcness. 

"Failh Connections" is Ihe name 
given lo the IPFW branch of Campus 



Life. This 



Each month the group also parti 
pates in lectures and discussions. On 
October 21 Dr. William Druening. 
Professor of Philosophy at IPFW will

The third and final workshop on

Campus Ministry students also

The fair will be held November 8

Castle offers scary time 




For all you adventurous souls, a visit 
lo the Haunted Castle should be consid- 
ered ihis Halloween, preferably not 

Specters and witches grcel you at the 
door, and for the next 50 minules, you 
are treated lo a spookingly good time. 
The line to gel inlo The Haunted Castle 
is an hour wait on the weekends. As 
you wait your turn lo enter, screams con 
be heard throughout the castle. Believe 
me, once you get in line backing out is 

There are many strange creaking nois- 
es lo go along with the screams, and 
Dark Shadows music is piped in Ihe 



background to listen lo as you make 
your way past a group of lost souls hav- 
ing a seance. 

Beware of getting into any coffin a 
ghoulish guide may instruct you to lay 
down in, you won't know where you 
will end up. 

After you get into Ihe coffin, the ghoul 
disposes of your body by pulling a rope, 
this in turn opens a trap door and then 
your body is unexpectedly hurled down 
a long cbulc, which is actually a slide 
that deposits you to the outside of the 
castle. 

This is not the end of your 50 minute 
haunt, because then visitors must re- 
enter and find their way out through the 
real exit with more long, dark, nanow 
halls and floors al lilted angles. This 
makes your way out even more of a 
struggle. Visitors never know what 
lurks around each dark turn. 
At one point, the floor ends in front of 
your feet and you must try lo climb into 
a vat of rubbery balls that reminds one 
of quicksand, because you sink before 
you gel to the other side. 

This is not for Ihe weak of heart, as Ihe 
' heart rale definitely increases after this 
outing. I would rale this trip two tomb- 
stones up. The S5 price of admission is 
nol that scary. This event is sponsored 
by the St. Vincent Scouls,

Tultle will speak at the NASA meeting 
to stress the awareness of Ibc diversity 
of the nations that co-exist. NASA was 
formed to help with educational assis- 
tance for Native American students and 
offer ways lo'look for different grants 
while they ore in school, 

"Manpower Council has the clout to 
help, and NASA is a support group to 
make Native American students aware 
that they are not alone," said Tutlle. 

According to a recent article in the 
Indianapolis News, Tuttlc reports that 
while many Americans think the 
wrongs committed against American 
Indians arc far in the past, these is not 

"While Oic general unemployment rate 
in Indiana has hovered around 6 per- 
cent, the rate among American Indians 
is 1 2.7 percent," said Tuttle. 

Indians also have a 24 percent high- 
school drop-out rate. 

"With a litde help those statistics can 
change, she added. "Our people arc 
willing to work." 

The staff of the Manpower council and 
members of its board are, by regulation. 
80 percent American Indian. 

"Our goal is to keep our people in 
school. Education makes people 



jfficienl and (hat i. 
goals." she said. 

Many people misunderstand c 
little knowledge of American 
culture and its traditions.

Oan Brogan has led his team 1o an 11-3 record this season 



by Aaron N. Thompson 
Sports Editor 

A great year for the IPFW women's 
tennis squad has received its first 
rewards for a great season. 

The Great Lakes Valley Conference 
named Coach Dan Brogan as Coach of 
the Year, while freshman Carrie 
Claypool was named all-GLVC after 
winning the No. 4 singles title at the 
GLVC Championships in Louisville last 
weekend. 

"Well, it was a nice award to win. You 
don't coach for the awards, bul for the 
team to improve. It (winning the award] 
was a reflection of the team's improve- 
ment," Brogan, who doubles as the 
men's coach, commented. 

Brogan, in his first season with the 
women's tennis program, has simply 
turned around the women's tennis 

"We went from not having anyone 
coming out of the first round to people 
making it out of the first round, to peo- 
ple making finals, and winning the par- 
ticular area." said Brogan. 

After finishing the 1992 campaign 
with a dismal record of 3-11 overall and 
1-7 in the GLVC, Brogan led the Lady 
Dons to an overall record of 1 1-3 and 5- 
3 in the GLVC in 1993. 

Finishing fourth in the regular season 
GLVC race. IPFW also finished fourlh 



in the GLVC Championships last wcek- 

"My goal is to have everyone play 
well." Brogan said on bis future goals 
for the team. 

Claypool, an IPFW freshman who 
graduated from Fort Wayne Northsidc, 
earned all-Conference honors after win- 
ning the No. 4 singles title in the GLVC 
Tournament. 

"For her, it's a great honor," added 
Brogan on his players success "And it's 
good for the program to have some rec- 
ognized for the first time." 

Finishing the regular season with an 
impressive record of 10-2 in singles 
competition, Claypool also teamed up 
with various players to go 3-0 in dou- 
bles. 

Jennifer Jackson. Joy Miller and Mary 
Zurbacb finished up with a great season. 

Jackson, an IPFW junior from 
Ligonier, Ind., compiled an impressive 
record of 10-2 as the No.l singles play- 
er for the Lady Dons. 

Miller, a sophomore who graduated 
from Fort Wayne Northrop, was the No. 
2 singles ace for IPFW, also finishing 
the regular season with a 10-2 record. 

The only undefeated performer in the 
regular season was No, 5 singles player, 
Mary Zurbach, 

Zurbach, a junior and New Haven 
graduate, finished the regular-season at 
13-0. Zurbach was also 2-0 in doubles 
competition.

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q: Just how effective 
are condoms at 
preventing AIDS? 

A: Recent studies show 
that latex condoms, used 
correctly and consistently, 
do prevent the 
transmission of HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS. 
They also prevent the 
transmission of other STDs 
such as syphilis and 
gonorrhea. Animal 
membrane condoms 
should NOT be counted on 
to prevent STDs.

"Wild Thing" humbled 

Blue Jays repeat as Champs 



Aaron N. Thompson 
Spurts Editor 

As everyone can see. belter pitching 

'ins gomes in the World Series. Ask 
Phillies' manager Jim Frcgosi. 

For the second lime in Ihe World 
Scries, "Wild Thing" Milch Williams 
blew a lead in Ihe waning moments of 
the game giving (he Toronto Blue Jays 
their second championship in a row. 

Williams, who is dubbed Ihe "Wild 
Thing" because of his erratic pitching 
;tyle, gave up a home run in the ninth 

nning to Joe Carter with Rickey 
Henderson and Paul Molilor on base. 
Thus, the Blue Jays went on to clinch 
games to 2 with the 8-6 vic- 

With the exception of the record set- 
ting 15-14 victory by the Blue Jays in 
game 4. the team that had the belter 
pitching ' 

Toronto's Paul Molilor was named 
MVP of the scries by going 12-for-24 
He had a single, a triple 
and a home run In game 6 including 2 
RBIs and scored three i 

Molilor, who bad been the World 
Scries only one other time when he 
played 15 years for the Milwaukee 
Brewers, was nearly benched during 
played in Philadelphia. 
Molilor throughout the course of tbc 
had been the designated hitter, 
which is not used in the Na 
League parks. Instead, Jays' manager 
Cilo Gaston pulled league baiting title 
champion John Olerud (who baited 
.363 in the regular season) so Ihe hot- 
bitting Molilor could play first. This 
marked only the second time in Ihe his- 
tory of the World Scries that a player 
who led Ibe league in balling had been 
benched during the Scries. 

The result of this decision by Gaston : 
an MVP award for Molilor and the 
World Series Championship for the 
Blue Jays. 

Another notable performance is that 
of Lenny Dykstro of Ihe Phillies. He hit 
four home runs in ihe scries, including 
two in gome 4 and another in the finale. 
Manager Jim Fregosi for the Phillies 
was named Manager of the Year. 

With this victory, the 
League now holds a 53-37 edge 
the National League in overall World 
Series records.

Chicago (3-2) at Green Bay (3-3) 

Green Bay is coming olf a terrific per- 
formance against Tampa Bay. They 
won the game 37-U as receiver 
Sterling Sbarpc caught 10 passes for 
147 yards and 4 TD's. Chicago is 
coming off of a division rivalry game 
with Minnesota and former 



quarterback Jim McMahon. 

Green Bay always gives Chicago U 

blc in Wisconsin. 



Kansas City (5-1) at Miami (5-1) 



Both teams are struggling and desper- 
ately need a victory; New England lost 
This is an early battle for AFC a heartbreak" to Seattle 10-9 last 

supremacy Both have bad quarterback week. Jeff Gcotge looked a little : 



problems recently, with Joe Montana 
aching for K.C. and Dan Marino out 
for Miami. Backup Scolt Mitchell 
looked impressive in the Dolphin's 41- 
27 victory over Indianapolis. The 
Chiefs are coming off a bye week. 



but did pass for two louch- 
s against the Dolphins last week. 

England always plays 
napolis well, so took for a close 



Tampa Bay (1-5) at Atlanta (2-5) 

Tampa Buy is hurting once again after 
getting trounced at home by Green Bay 
37-14. They are about to play a team 
that appears to be bouncing back after a 
; alcon QB Bobby Hcberl 
burned his former Saint I 
with a 13 for 16 effort with two TD 
passes in a 26-15 victory. Atlanta is 2-0 
with Deion Sunders back in the line-up. 

N.V. Jets (2-4) at N.V Giants (5-1) 

Who is really at home in this game? It 
probably won't matter because the 
are well rested and the Jets 
The Jets lost to Buffalo 19-10 
last week. Boomer Esiason has looked 
impressive, but an anemic running 
game has left the offense reeling. The 
Giants have looked impressive with 
Phil Simms at quarterback. Tbc "Battle 
of New York" is a must win for the Jets 
if they hope to make the playoffs. 



Snn Diego (2-4) at LA. Raider* (4-2) 

Both (cams are coming off much need- 
ed bye weeks. Tbc Chargers have 
struggled all season long with putting 
points on the board They are not hav- 
ing a productive year at Ibe quarter- 
back position. The Raiders have 
looked very good al limes, bul have 
also struggled al times. This should be 
a hard-nosed, low scoring defensive 

LA. Rams (2-5) at San Francisco (40) 

The Rams have now lost three straight 
games, with last week's loss coming at 
the hands of the Detroit Lions. 16-13. 
Jim Evercli was yanked in the third

"Then 



s not relieved a 



whole lot of problems because it's not 
Belting a lot of use," said Kalter, "The 
new entrance is safer and faster." 
Other students criticized the value of 
the emergency telephones during times 
of crisis. 



"How could one 
rape on campus?" i 



me student. 

Kattcr explained that the purpose of 
(be emergency phones is to increase 
students' security level. He added that, 
in addition to the emergency pboncs. 
the police patrol the parking lots regu- 
larly. 

"How can the lighting on campus be 
improved?" asked a student. Kattcr 
responded that the parking lots arc ade- 
quately illuminated, but that walking 
areas are a problem. 

"There is a problem because the cam- 
pus is maturing," said Kattcr. 

He explained that a project right now 
in the works Is lo replace the present 
lighting with more intense lights. He 
mentioned the two entrances of Kettlcr 
Hall and the area between Classroom 
Medical and Helmke Library as areas 
(hat require the brighter lights. 

A student asked DcnHartog about the 

gunned down after blinking their car 
headlights at vehicles that have the 
headlights off. According to the rumor, 
those unlightcd vehicles arc driven by 
gang members who interpret the other 
drivers' 'lights out' signal literally, then 
follow those drivers home to shoot 

DcnHartog said that he called the Fort 
Wayne City police and Ibey confirmed 
that it was Iruo. He then called Ihe 
police in Illinois, and they could not 
confirm whether it was true or not. 

Administrators talked about the diffi- 
culty of putting important information 
in the hands of students. In response, 
DcnHartog said (hat he publishes slfllis- 
tics in Ihe student newspaper, and 
Collen said be would be willing to put 
important information on (be bulletin 
boards around campus 

Open forums for students and admin- 
istrators to discuss issues arc planned 
monthly for the remainder of the acade-
