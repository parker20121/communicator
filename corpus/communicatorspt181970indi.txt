Mondo)' night, 5cpi. H, 
■ lely fifty students 



attend the first 
..„„onal workshop of 
'Ihe Students' Government. 
The event, largely unstruc- 
tured, WHS an attempt lo en- 
list the support of the stu- 
dent body behind the program; 
for the coming year of tbe 
student government. 

Student IJody President 
Scott Gillie opened the 
meeting by staling, "This 
is workshop; therefore 
and necessarily, the work 
must be done by you." 
Uillie then introduced the 
members of the student gov- 
ernment who were present. 
The people then divided in- 
to lUrce groups: Legiala- 
tive, Judicial, and Elxecu- 
tivc, to discuss the activi- 
ties of each group and lo 
orient the students to sev- 
eral issues on the campus. 
After an hour and a half. 
the meeting reconvened and 
divided into single-Issue 
groups. 

Students in these groups 
discussed what they could 
do to provide free parking, 
improve the library and 
-"udy facilities, improve the 




service and the food in tbe 

lain procedures of the book- 
store. With plans to carry 

the groups adjourned. 

Another workshop will 
be hold on October 12 at 
which lime the groups wijl 
submit progress reports. 

Secretary of the Trea- 
sury Tim Brown suggested 



thnl 






- fo&lt; 



rkshop, there 
should be more participation 
on the part of the new people 
and less dotnination on the 
part of the government 
people. 

The workshop seemed 
to echo the approach which 
student government has been 
taking rccently-the approach 
of opening channels of com- 
munication with the students, 
Gillie noted that the senti- 
ment among members of ibc 
student government was 
that of surprise at the ease 
with which student govern- 
ment secured many new 
members and u larger num- 
ber of informed supporters.

'1776' AT SCOTTISH RITE OCT. 1ST. 



Some days nothing seems to go right*** 



"1776", one of Broad- 
way's most brilliantly suc- 
cessful musicals o{ recent 
years has been booked by 
Indiana Institute of Tech- 
nolog)' and Broadway Pro- 
ductions to come lo the 
Scottish Rite Auditorium 
for two performances on 
Oct. 1st. 

Lurrv Bower, Director 
of Public Relations at In- 
diana Tech, said tickets 
will go on sale in late 
August for the two oerfor- 
manccs, a matinee at 3749pm 
and an evening performance 



at 8:30pm. 

This jocular, lyrical 
portrayal of what happened 
during those hot weeks of 
debate in Philadelphia, 
nearly 200 years ago, be- 
fore the Continental Con - 

passing the Declaration of 
Independence, was one of 
the surprise hits of the New 
Vork season when it opened 
in March 1569." No one had 
thought that a gaily ex- 
citing musicol entertain- 
ment could be made out of 
the solemn historical event 



that gave birlh lo the A- 



When, however, tbe 
show paraded Thomas Jef- 
ferson, John Adams, Ben- 
jamin Franklin. John Han- 
cock and other great Foun- 
ding Fathers in human, 
sparkling - witty, sli^tly 
spoofing terms and with 
songs, critics und audiences 
welcomed the show with joy. 
laughter, cheers and a renew- 
ed sense of palriolic pride 
tn the American inheritance. 
"1776" immediately be-

TBI COMMUNICATOR 




In llic post decade, gui- 
larisl Charlie Byrd has emer- 
ged on the inlcrnnlional mus- 
ic scene as a Rullar glanl. 
Although the guitur has brid- 
ged the worlds of classical 
nnd popular music throughout 
its long history, one seldom 
finds a guitarist who works 
with equal case in the idioms 
of bolh classical music and 
jaz7. nillis Conoverof the 
\oice of America has said: 
"Charlie Byrd's veraalilily 
in the literature of the guilur 
surpasses thai of anyone else 
He &gt;s a masterful jack of all 
guitar trades." 

Byrd, as a child, learn- 
ed to play guitar from his 
father, lie performed rcguliirr 
ly »ith local bands around hii 
home urea in sougheasi Vir- 
ginia. During World narll. 
after a stint in the Infantry , 
he worked for Arm) Special 
Servict's in u Iruveiling G.l. 
orchestra, nhilc in Paii», 
»ilh the Army, Uf met the 
laic gypsy guilarlsl. Django 
Hcinhurdt, a legendary' 
pioneer in the develupmenl 
of the juzi! guitar. Thai 
encounter crystallized Byrd's 



in classical guitar 
ilion to a formidable 
background, and he b 

put his training to wo

Music School. Me played 
piek-up jav.y. jobs nnd grad- 
ually became a familiar figure 
on the Ne« YoH* ja// scene, 
During these years he perform 
cd »ilh Sol Yuged, Joe Mar- 
sala. Alv) West and IVeddie 
Slack. During the late 19'tO's 
howcvri. not satisfied with 
his direction, Byrd dceided 
to study classical guitar. 
lliis decision marked a major 
milestone in his career. Byrd 
moved to nashinglon, D.C. in 
1950 where be studied com^ 
position kvith Thomas Simmon! 
and classical guitar with 
Sophocles Papas, n leading 
teacher and elder 9lolcsnian 
of the classical guitar Morld. 
In 195-1, Uurd received a six- 
week scholarship lo study 
with the great Sponisb clas- 
sicdl guitarist Andres Seg- 
ovia al Siena, Italy. 

Al this point Byrd. rea- 
lized that fen* musicians pos- 
sessed his intensive training 



n of 

of modern musie.arguing that 
"It's a wedding that loses 
the best of bolh." (TIMI':9 
M '59) Rather he kept the 
comparlmcntnli/ed,but play- 
ed bolh "blues and Bach" 
in the some program. The 
technical proficiency derived 
from his classical training 
opened up a new level of per- 
formance — \af.7. pluyed on a 
classical guitar wilhoul a 
pick or amplification. 

In 1956, Byrd produced

of ibe activities fee. 

President Gillie nnd his 
associates have prepared a 
referendum for the students anc 
ioard of iruslees approval, ask 
ing for changes. 

As the activity fee stands 
low, students with nine credrl 
lOurs or more pay S15 ench for 

a total of 88'l,000. This en 
compasses apprtiximatelj 

2,800 people. 

Of this money, the alli-

nnd funds nround the campus'. 
iVith the changes pro- 
posed, all who attend the lU- 
PU campus, tPgnrdless of 
credit hours, will have to 
puy n set amount of money. 

Gillie said this sum has 
ol yet, not been decided up- 
on, but will probably amount 
to aboulSe.OO for each per- 
son. With Ihe additional 
3200 students paying this 
fee. the lolal revenue would 
would come to approximately 
572.000 for the year. 

Gillie staled thai athletic 
vould receive the greatest cut. 
n It's budget, unless they 
:ould show ihat they are pro- 
.iding more activities for more 
people. The athletic depart- 
il presentl) caters toabout 



400 people out of 6,000 
students enrolled on the campu; 

When questioned whether o 
not he could see any hang-ups 
in the passage of this rcferne- 
dum. Gillie replied that this 
was a large part of his cam- 
paign last year and by virtue 
of his election, the majority of 
students approved, Noii, '.he 
referendum lies in the hands of 
the students. Should students 
elect to lower the fee, this 
will be passed onto the Board 
of Trustees of the parent uni- 
versities for final approval. 
Implementation of the lowered 
fee would probably be Se] 
fee would probably be Beptem-

A Goldmine in Fort Wayne ? 

MR.&amp;Mrs.D. 
Give Insight to Being Young 

Regardless of Age 



Meet Mr. and Mrs. L. D. of Fi. Wayne-«ur goldmine of 
the year! 

They are 77 and 76 years oid, respectively, and are one 
of the deep, dark, hidden secrels dial so often rest in (he 
inner sanctums of the Ft. Wayne older generation. 

A goldmine? We think so. And ainee we were lucky 
enough to make contact with them, we would like to share our 
findings with you—lhe newspaper audience 

Mr. and Mrs. D., both originally from Lima, Ohio, 
itioved lo Fort Wayne in 1926. They have lieen married for ■'56 
years. At presenl Mrs. D. is confined to a wheelchair, Mr. D. 
doep nil of the housework, etc. But, enough of (heir back- 
grouni^ come along and meet one of the most talented couples of 
Fori W'nyne. 

Mr. D. is an artisU You can see his work from the following 
pjcttires. One of his most delightful pieces in a wagon (rail 
all hand carved. It sits in their back yard on a round section of 
wood and is powered bj' electricity. It consists of ihe lead 
wagon boasting a sign "Oklahoma or Bust", a second buggy 
carrying a driver pulling a woman and child. Coming up in the 
rear is a cowboy on his horse-and the horse act^ially rocks as 

it goes around in circles. Mr. D. has taped a segnent of music 
played on "Hee-Haw" and he plays it whenever the wagon 
train is running. 

Their back yard also hails many wind items such as the fol- 
lowing; n man in a boat that pulls up a fish, a farm woman 
churning butler, two chickens kissing, and a man sawing wood - 
all mo\ing when the wind blows. 

A trip to the basement proved lo be one of the best parts 
of the expedition. 

With the throwing of a svvitch, a regular circus carnival set- 
up is lighted. A ferris-wheel full of fun seeking wooden people 
turns, a nieny-go^ound with all sorts of dolls spins and a. circus 
cage housing two lions and a gorilla is pulled b;*' four horses. 

lUpslairs boasts even more treasure. Mrs. D, has collected 
over a hundred salt and pepper shakers and displays (hem in a 
cabinet made for them by her husband. 

Mrs. D. also has made many hand-stitched quills, one of 
which she displayed for us. She designed the pattern herself; 
and she calls it "Resident Plate". She also showed 

us her Kent china which is all hand painted-even the flowers on 
the inside of the lea cup. 

With further investigation of their home, we came upon a 
beautiful picture hanging on the wall which turned out to be a 
jig-saw puzzle; several piclure frames encasing age-old photo- 
graphs of Mr. D's parents; hand carved lamps made of walnut and 
maple, a clock which was given to Mr. D's parents, a child's 

maple a clock which was given to Mr. D's parents on their wed- 
ding day, a child's rocker, hand carved by Mr. D., a verj' sturdy 
table and chair made of wild cherry wood (he even chopped down 
the tree 5, a hand carved spice cabinet, dishes over 300 years old 
and a wire recorder -the predecessor lo the tape recorder. 

How did Mr. D. get started on all of this? He said he first 
started "tirlkerin' 'round". His ideas? "I just make 'em up," 
ho said. Ho calls his artwork crude, but he enjoys showing the 
whole makeup of everything he has created. 

Mrs. D. enjoyed telling us about her girlhood on a farm 
where she mainly remembers making 50 pounds of butter and croan 
week. She lold us the history of her first name which is derived 
from a 1-100 year old Indian name. She is very Bible minded and 
told us she was liapti-z.ed in n ri\iT when she was 14, ...ju.-i 
like Jesus." She was very proud of all of her possessions and 
even though he resisted at times, she had Mr. D. bringing things 
down from the upstairs and off of the shelves for all of us to view 

A goldmine? Derinitelyl As we ended our visit, Mrs. D. 
sal in hor wheelchair and waved good-bye from the back door, 
Mr. D. ran Ihe wagon imin one more lime for us, and wo ambled 
off after taking piles of notes, several pictures, and making a 
promise that we would be back' again.

Faith Is not a 
phenomenon besides 
others, but the centrnl 
nhenoinenon in man's pergonal 
life, manifest and hidrten at the 
sane time. It is reliEiour- ond tr^n- 
scen^ljr rvTiglon, it Is universal and 
concrete, it is Infinitely variable 
and always the same, ^alth is an es- 
sential possibility of man, and there- 
fore its existence is necessary and un- 
iversal. It is possible and necessary in 
our period. If faith is understood as what 5t 
centrally is, ultimate concern, it cannot be 
undercut my modern science nr any kind of phil- 
osophy. And it cannot be discredited by its super- 
stitlr.n'? nr authcritsrian distortions within and out- 
side churchc:;, sects, and movements. Faith stondn ut'on 
itself and Justifies itself against those who nttur.k It 
because thcv can attac'K: it only in the name of another 
faith. It is the triumph of the dynamics of faith that 
any denial of faith is Itself an expression of faith, o 
ultimate concern.
