According to statistics from registrar 



IPFW dynamic, growing institution 



A statistical compilation released 
by the Indiana-Purdue Registrar's 
Office reveals that the Fort Wayne 
institution is dynamic, rapidly growing 
and distinguished by an unusually 
mature student population. 

Growth is a predominant theme 
throughout the compilation. The 
statistical profile traces the evolution 
of IPFW from its beginning in 1964 as a 
commuter campus with 2948 students 
into an authentic university with a total 
enrollment of 8961. Indiana-Purdue, 
once the size of an average high 
schook, has grown in only eleven years 
into an institution larger than Notre 

During the latest phase of growth, 



Indiana Purdue's impressive growth 

j may be partly explained by the breadth

New Child Care Center 
director to be appointed 



By TOMMY FRANKE 

The search will soon begin for a new 
director of the IPFW Child Care 
Center. Nancy Getzin, past director, 
was asked to leave that post and she did 
not return to the Center after semester 

Dean John P. Ulmer, dean of 
student services is no! acting director 
of the center. Jean Reed is working as 
coordinator until a new director can be 

The Communicator published re- 
ports last semester regarding person- 
nel problems at the Center. Getzin has 
sent a letter to one of the employees, 
Glada Landis, charging her with 
"improper personal conduct" and 
warning her of possible discharge. 

Landis and another worker, Dar- 
lene Bililie, were later asked to take an 
indefinite leave of absence and then 
were terminated from their jobs. 

Several other employees have left 
the center since its inception. When 
contacted by a Communicator report- 
er, Dixie Weaver stated that she had 



left the center because "the advisable 
learning conditions and basic concerns 
for good child care were not being 
met." She said she found it difficult to 
organize her curriculum because she

fflt at the center.

received no help from Getzin. She also taking and reviewing applications for 
the job of director. The committee will 
consist of Ulmer, representatives from 
the center's advisory board, and 
interested faculty. 

Ulmer thinks that the new director 
will probably be chosen by spring or 



Getzin. Meg Bloom was fired by Getzin 
for being critical of center policies in 
December of 1974. Another past Center 
employee started working at the center 
with no experience with small children 
and finally quit out of frustration, 
stating that she was offered no help by 
Getzin. 

When asked if Landis and Bilile 
would be reinstated this fall since their 
jobs were terminated because of 
disagreements with Getzin, Ulmer 
stated that since they had been 
terminated, they would have to reapply 
and go through the regular channels. 

However. Ulmer noted that all 
positions are filled at the center at this 
time. He also said that he hired one new 
teacher to teach the pre-school class 
recently. He noted that neither Landis

Indiana-Purdue to be named Official 
Bicentennial University at special ceremony 



IPFW will be named an Official 
Bicentennial University in a special 
ceremony Monday, Jan. 19 at 9 a.m. 

Walter Helmke, Jr., chairman of 
the Indiana State Bicentennial Com- 
mission, will present a plaque to 
Chancellor Donald Schwartz and a flag 
to Student body President Charles 
Pratt. 

The American Revolution Bicen- 
tennial Commission chose to bestow 
this honor on IPFW because of various 
programs relevant to the American 
bicentennial that have been presented 
by IPFW and because of programs that 
are in the future. 

The IPFW Bicentennial Commit- 
tee, chaired by Professor James Haw, 
sponsored a Bicentennial Lecture 
Series last fall. Those lectures 
culminated in a publication. IPFW was ' 
also involved with other area colleges I 
in the Friemann Intercollegiate Lee- 



William Rehnquist, 
:e of the Supreme Court, 
was one of the speakers in that series. 
In February a film series will be 
presented at IPFW on Colonia 
Williamsbury. Purdue- Indiana Theatre 
will present "1776" in March and April. 
The Library will have several exhibits 
during the spring semester on the 



bicentennial theme The Department of 
Education is planning an exhibit for 
Glen brook mail. 

The ceremony will take place at 
the flagpole in front of Kettler and last 
about an half hour. All students, faculty 
and staff are invited to attend the 
presentation. 



Placement convocation to be 
held for spring graduates 

Monday there will be a placement 
convocation in the Student Union 
Ballroom for all students planning to 
graduate this spring. The convocation 
will begin at 4:30 p.m. 

Robert Barkhaus, director of the 
Career Development and Placement 
Center, said, "All aspects of the 
placement procedure will be discussed. 
Information concerning registration 
with the placement center and a guide 
to writing resumes will be distributed 
at the meeting." 




A partial list of companies and 
school corporations that will be 
recruting on campus this spring will 
also 'be made available "I anticipate 
that there will be several additional 
companies that will be interviewing 
which are not on the list, " Barkhaus 



said. "Many companies wait until 
March or April to assess the number of 
positions that may be open for the 
coming year. The list will be up-dated 
periodically." 

Barkhaus will discuss the correct 
procedures for signing-up for inter- 
views. Interview sign-ups for past 
graduates only will be Friday, January 
30. Sign-ups for other candidates are 
slated for Monday, February 2. The 
location for the sign-up sessions will be 
disclosed at the convocation. 

Tips on the preparation and 
execution of actual interviews will also 
be mentioned. 

"The Placement Center has done a 
great service for the students In the 
past and this year many career 
opportunities are again available," 
said Barkhaus.

Medical Service extends flu 
immunization program 



IPFW faculty, staff, and students, 
as well as members of their immediate 
families, will be able to receive low 
cost flu shots from the campus Medical 
Serice until March 1. Starley Pifer, 
R.N.. and IPFW medical service 
director, said that she decided to 
extend the deadline for the mass flu 
immunization program, originally 
February 1, because unusually mild 
early winter weather and a resulting 
low incidence of flu apparently 
encouraged a low turnout for the 
program this season. 
_ Pjfer stressedthe importance of 



booster shots in in 
for those who have already been 
innoculated. According to the medical 
service director, a single shot serves as 
initial immunization while a second 
serves as a booster, effective for one 

The flu shots, costing $1.50 each, 
can be obtained on a drop-in basis at 
the Medical Service office located in 
G27 in the Student Union. The office is 
open Monday through Friday from 8: 00 
a.m. to 5:00p.m. Appointments may be 
arranged by calling the office at 5484. 



transfer students from institutions in 
other states. A substantial number of 

1 the latter came from distant states, 
Nino students came in the local campus 
from California institutions, three from 
Arizona institutions, and two from 

.Florida institutions. Surprisingly, the 
state contributing the most transfer 
students to IPFW was not the campus' 
closest neighbor Ohio, but the more 
remote Michigan. 

Indiana-Purdue University at Fort 
Wayne, dynamic as il is, is distinguish 
ed by the maturity of its student body. 
The average student age, as revealed 
in the profile is 25.1, well above the 
norm for American universities. The 
overall maturity of the IPFW student 
population is significant in light of the 
vast age range anions [he students. 
The youngest student at IPFW is a 



tender 15and the oldest a venerable 73, 
The unique maturity of the IPFW 
student population is underscored by 
its unusually large percentage of 
married students and the growing 
number of graduate students. Well 
over one third, or 38.8 percent of IPFW 
students are married, and 16 percent 
are enrolled in graduate programs. 

Most IPFW students earn their 
way through school. According to the 
research summary, only 5 percent 
receive financial aid. Not surprising, in 
light of the overwhelming percentage 
of self-supporting students at IPFW, 57 
percent of the student body is enrolled 
on a part-time basis.

Lebamoff joins 
IPFW faculty 



By KATHY FRANSON 

"I was really going to become a 
professor at one time, with a PhD in 
European Affairs," said former Ft. 
Wayne mayor Ivan Lebamoff regard- 
ing his past experience with teaching. 

"I did my undergraduate work in 
Eastern Europe and studied Russian, 
Bulgarian and French. Then I went to 
law school to finish up the analytical 
aspects and I stayed in law school 
instead. But I always loved teaching," 
Lebamoff explained, 

Lebamoff recently finished a four 
year term as mayor of the city. He has 
been added to the faculty of IPFW this 
semester and is teaching an under- 
graduate course titled Introduction to 
Public and Environmental Affairs, 
V170. He is also teaching a graduate 
course, Executive Leadership, V566. 

"The Introduction to Environ- 
mental Affairs Class will deal with a 
whole spectrum of urban problems, 
"said Lebamoff. The problems he cited 



Ithat the class will study included, 
J housing, education, crime, aspects of 
| zoning, taxation, and the role of senior 
icitizens in a community. 

"In the graduate class, Executive 
[Leadership, which meets Thursday 

nights from 7 :30 to 9 : 10, we'll spend the 
I time really looking at the logic of the 
[power structure in relation to the 

democratic theory." He continued, "I 
[think I can offer a good deal of first 
;hand experience, and I hope these 
! students leave with the understanding 
;of the impact the power theory has on 

politics and how leadership is molded 
,by it. They'll learn the abilities, the 
(capabilities, the drawbacks and the 

trade-offs that are all part of 
[community government." 

Lebamoff feels that he will be able 
|to draw from his background in city 

government to effectively instruct 

these classes. "I always felt the role of 

mayor was that of a teacher." he said. 
"I'm looking forward to 'his 
semester very much." 



Faculty Senates 
vote on AROTC 



By KATHY FRANSON 
The status of the A.R.O.T.C. 
program (Army Reserve Officers 
Training Courses) is still undecided, 
but steps have been made to bring it 
closer to campus. 

It has now been passed by the 
Purdue Faculty Senate earlier this 
week, and by the Indiana Faculty 
Senate on Tuesday by a vote of eight to 



quently, ballots will have to be mailed 
.to each member and the results 
counted. "By the time we have all that 
done," said Helen Gibbons, secretary 
of the Indiana Senate, "I estimate that 
1 it will take about two weeks to find 

The reasoning behind the estab- 
lishment of the courses according to 
the contract written by the Faculty 
Senate, is to provide an additional 
means of financial aid and also a wider 
span of career choices for both men 
and women students. In addition, it will 
serve to broaden the educational base 
of the university. Since a contingent of 
US Army personnel is currently 
assigned to the Indiana Institute of 
, Technology for the purpose of 
conducting an A.R.O.T.C. program, 
and since the commander of that 
contingent had expressed a willingness 



10 teach the A.R.O.T.C. courses on the 
j IPFW campus the issue was set before 
the Chancellor to take the actions 
necessary to enable the A.R.O.T.C. 
courses to be offered. 

According to the contract, this is 
■ because the presence of the A.R.O.T.C. 
personnel on campus will result in 
certain direct and overhead expenses 
to the university and because the 
Indiana University existing policy 
makes provisions for the recovery of 
some portion of these costs through fee 
charges and because the Purdue 
University policy permits only building 
tdebt retirement charges as fees 
(currently 18.00 per credit hour) the 
(A.R.O.T.C. course will be consistent 
:with that charged for other courses 
[offered at the campus (currently $21.00 
Iper credit hour 

The contract also states that the 
faculty of the A.R.O.T.C. courses will 
be designated as Associate Faculty. 
The Vice-Chancellor will assign them 
to an appropriate existing department 
or division, as a collateral function of 
that academic unit for the purpose of 
supplying necessary administrative 
and supports 



An A.R.O.T.C. council will be 

created for the purpose of approving 

and evaluating their goals and 

directions with those of the University.

GUEST COLUMNIST 



EDITORIAL) 

Lebamoff valuable here 

Ivan A. Lebamoff, former mayor of Fort Wayne, has joined the faculty of 
IPFW. Lebamoff will be instructing two courses, Introduction to Public and 
Environmental Affairs, V170. an undergraduate course, and Executive 
Leadership, V566 on the graduate level. 

Lebamoff, who was just barely defeated in the mayoral race by Robert 
Armstrong in November, comes to IPFW with teaching as well as practical 
experience in the field of public and environmental affairs, the division to which he 
was appointed by Chancellor Donald Schwartz, subject to the approval of the 
Indiana University Board of Trustees. His appointment Is effective January 1, 1976 
through June 30, 1977. 

Lebamoff received his J.D. degree in law from Indiana University, 
Bloomington. and was a teaching assistant there from 1954 to 1957. He brings a 
wealth of practical experience to his new position, including service as a Foreign 
Service Officer in the Commerce Department of the Federal government, as 
Democratic chairman for Allen County, and as mayor of Fort Wayne from 1972 
through 1975. 

His administration as mayor of Fort Wayne was high-lighted by his efforts to 
involve all citizens of Fort Wayne in the management of city government, 
regardless of race, religion or sex. His attempts to set promotions in the Police and 
Fire Departments according to merit, rather than political affiliation of 
individuals, are to be commended. 

His wealth of experience can do nothing less than enrich the faculty at IPFW. 
Thank you. Chancellor Schwartz, for appointing Ivan, and thank you, Ivan, for 
joining us. We all wish you well in your new undertaking.

OPINION 



Women -A vital part of 76 



By ANNE MOROWITZ 
By KATHY FRANSON 

The front door is open now, and 
after centuries of trying the lock and 
waiting on the threshold, women have 
finally stepped into the world. 
This is not to say that women 
never had a taste of what it is like to. 
possess personal influence and to be 
confident in their own independence, 
because they have now and then before 
the door was again slammed shut. In 
fact, in the days of ancient Egypt, 
women (providing of course they had 
the wealth ) could buy and sell land and 
personal property (as opposed to her 
being personal property ) in the same 
capacity as men. .They were advisors 
and rulers in government. But what 
happened to them after/that? 



dormant. Occasionally a woman 
believed herself to be a person would 
come along and make a noise at the 
door, but she would soon be quieted. 
After all, as Simone deBovier once 
said, "There are two kinds of people in 
the world - woman and human beings, 
and when women start acting like 
human beings, they're accused of 
, trying to be men." 



Through much of history women 
were famous or prominent because 
they were married to a man of position 
or of equal fame. Of coursethere were 
exceptional individuals, but that's just 
exactly what they were-exceptions. 

However, things are changing now. 
In this Bicentenial year women 
will be able to stand beside men 
knowing they are as as much a part of 
this country's breathing and growing 
as men. Women have made indelible 
marks in the areas of industry, art, 
music, government and sports. 

On January 5, Time magazine 
featured 11 women on their cover 
ted 






ictivities they felt 
U women took the place of Time's 

COMMUNICATOR 



traditional "Man of the Year". It was. 
not that Time felt that it required U 
women to equal one man, but there had" 
been so many worthy women so long 
neglected it would have been impos- 
sible to choose just one. 
Their occupations ranged widely from 
Chief Justice to electricianT 

The dead ends women used to 
encounter are gone now, but the roads 
behind them are still rough" 
Considering that women in this 
country did not receive the vote unttf 
August 26, 1920, 56 short years ago, a 
great deal of catching up has been 
made by women since. : I 

Just think how far the poor women. 
of Switzerland have got to go yet-They 
didn't get the vote until 1974, 

And we thought Switzerland was a 
civilized country.

Career seminars to be telecast 



A series of five 90-minute 
live seminars dealing with 
five approaches to career 
education will be telecast 
over the closed-circuit net- 
work of the Indiana Higher 
Education Telecommunicat-

ial service professionals. 

The series is funded by a

sity of Evansville from the 
U.S. Office of Education's 
Office of Career Education. 
Dr. Robert Garnett, dean of 
the University's School of 
Education, is director of the 
project, known as the Career 
Education Televised Seminar 
Series (CETSS). Production 
and origination of the IHETS 
network will be from the

at Ball State University in 
Muncie. 

Each month a group of 



:ular needs and 
interests in the area of career 
education. Each program will 
feature a well-known expert

Beginning in January 
1976, Fort Wayne will have a 
talent education program 
patterned after the early 
music education school 
founded by Shinichi Suzuki, 
the Japanese violinist and 
teacher. 

Talent Education of Fort 
Wayne, Suzuki string playing 
for childfen three years of 
age and older, is a parent- 
run, non-profit organization 
devoted to following Suzuki's 
philosophy and principles of 
his teaching methods. 

The Suzuki approach 
relies strongly on the cooper- 
ative relationship of teacher, 
parent, and student. Although 
it is not merely a violin, or 
cello, or piano method, it does 
require careful, patient, per- 



sistent study and practice on 
the instrument. Rather talent 
education is a combination of 
a philosophy, a technique, 
and a program of education. 
There will be a demon- 
stration in Neff Hall Auditor- 
ium tonight, Janaury 15, 7 
p.m. String playing will be 
introduced by Lorraine Fink, 
Suzuki specialist from 
Athens, Ohio. Fink will also 
lead a string pedagogy 
workshop-seminar for teach- 
ers, students, and parents on 
Saturday, January 17.

Indiana Faculty likewise elected by the 
Indiana faculty, the commander of the 
A.R.O.T.C. faculty contingent and the 
chairperson of the academic unit to 
which the courses are assigned. The 
of office for the elected faculty 
members will be two years except in 
the case of the initial year of this

member for a one-year term and one 
for a two year term. 
The chairman of this council will

members are eligible candidates for 
this office. The chairperson will call 
meetings of the council as needed, and 
will report to the Senates on the s

each semester and will also recom- 
mend any major needed polivcy

dental hygiene students at 
IPFW was held at 1:30 p.m., 
Sunday, January 11, 1976, at 
the campus in the Recital 
Hall in Neff Hall. 

Dr. Donald Classify, 
local practicing dentist gave 
the major address to the 20 
hygiene students receiving 
their caps. Reception of the 
cap, the symbol of the dental 
hygiene profession, signifies 
that the student has demon- 
strated sufficient mastery of 
skill to enable her to perform 
clinical services at the initial 

Dr. Emory Bryan, Sr., 
member of the Dental Auxil- 
iary Program Coordination 
Committee of the Isaac 
Knapp Dental Society was the 
master of ceremonies. Other 
participants included Irma 
Rumbaugh, practicing den- 
tist and IPFW dental hygiene 
faculty member who gave the 
invocation and benediction, 
and Dr. George C. Smith, 
director of dental auxiliary 
education, who extended a 
Welcome to the group. Mrs. 
Clarence Huxoll, supervisor 
of the IPFW dental hygiene 



department officiated at the 
ceremony.

respective class presidents. 
Mrs. Connie *Clair of tht 
second-year class, and Mrs.

IPFW receives '500 
for student research 



Four Indiana-Purdue 
University marketing stu- 
dents were recently present* 
ed with an unsolicited and 
unexpected $500 check by the 
dodge Corporation in apprec- 
iation for a research study 
that they designed for that 
company. The study, conduc- 
ted by Dean Laytzenheiser, 
Jay Gerber, Steve Bryan, and 
Marcia Wilson and directed 
by Dr. Zoher Shipchandler of 
the IPFW Business and 
Economics department as- 
certained the preference of 
consumers for a new product 
that the Polymer Products 
Group of Phelps-Dodge is 
iritroducing. 

In a letter accompanying 
the check the General Man- 
ager of the Phelps-Dodge 
Polymer Products group, Jim 
Pritchard, praised the study 



Horse care 
seminar slated 

"Care and Feeding of 
Your Pleasure Horse" is the 
title of a special one-day 
seminar to be offered by 
IPFW on Saturday, January 
24. The workshop will be 
geared to pleasure horse 
owners and riders of all ages. 

Beginning at 9:00 a.m. 
and ending at 4 :00 p.m., the 
seminar will include such 
topics as general care and 
feeding, vaccination and par- 
asite control, common di- 
seases of the horse, care and 
treatment of feet and legs, 
and tips on purchasing a 



calling it, "well-designed and 
well carried-out" and adding 
that, "the results were 
clearly and concisely pre- 
sented." The company re- 
quested that the check, 
made-out to Indiana Univer- 
sity, be used by the Business 
Department to develop simi- 
lar projects in the future. 

According to Dr. Ship- 
chandler, the Phelps-Dodgt 
Corporation was so impress- 
ed by the student's efforts 
thai ii plans to include the 
project in a promotional 
campaign that it is launching 
in January at Chicago's 
McCormick Place Exposition 
Center. The company has 
invited the four IPFW stu- 
dents to attend the Chicago 
presentation and has offered 
to pay all their expenses for 
the trip. Phelps-Dodge also 
intends to use the IPFW study 
as a prototype for similar 
studies that it plans to 
conduct on the East and West 

Dr. Shipchandler sees the 
Phelps-Dodge award as a 
breakthrough for both his 
own department and IPFW as 
a whole. The company has 
supported similar research 
projects at the Lafayette 
Campus of Purdue, but 
according to the professor, it 
was hesitant about turning to 
IPFW. He expressed hope 
that the excellent perform- 
ance of the four marketing 
students and the recognition 
of their efforts by the 
Phelps-Dodge Corporation ; 
will attract the attention of; 
area businesses to the wealth' 
of resource available at' 
IPFW.

Masties amass 9-8 record 



By REX PUTT 

Norm Ziegler came off 
the bench late in the second 
half, hit consecutive Held 
goals, and ignited a faltering 
IPFW squad, as the Tuskers 
overcame a 9 point deficit and 
edged Oakland City College, 
90-89 in the first game of the 
St. Francis basketball tour- 
nament at the Central Catho- 
lic gym. 

A flurry of Mastodon 
fouls found three reserves 
filling starting spots late in 
the game and enabled the 
Oaks to gain a 98-79 lead with 

Tusker's depth paid off, 
however, as they came from 
behind (o squrak out the one 
point margin of victory. 

The Mastodons indicated 
their offensive potential in a 
well-played first half, as they 
grabbed a comfortable 52-43 
halftime lead In the second 
stanza the persistent Oaks 
turned several IPFW miscues 
into points, shooting a torrid 
field goal percentage. 

The Tusher offense play- 
ed sloppily after intermis- 
sion, not scoring at one point 
for nearly three minutes. 
With 8:32 remaining the 
Oakland City Squad regained 
the lead for the first time 



since early in the contest, and 
increased the margin to nine. 
But the Mastodons ate away 
at the Oaks lead, and with 
1:09 left Neal Putt put the 
Tuskers in the lead for good, 

Mitch Easterly led the 
Mastodon offensive attack 
with 27 points and 14 
rebounds. Teammates Putt 
and Meyer followed with a 
dozen a piece, and Martin 
tallied 21. Slmpon tallied 23 
for Oakland City, while 
Gibson and Luttrell each hit 
double figures with 16 and 17 
respectively. 

Tuskers Runner-up In Tour- 
In the championship 
game of the St. Francis 
basketball tourney, the host 
Cougars outscored the Tusk- 
ers 103-82, defeating the 
Mastodons for the second 
time this season. 

The Tuskers were play- 
ing at a disadvantage, having 
defeated Oakland City earlier 
as the day, while the St. 
Francis squad entered the 
championship game by wayi 
of an Indiana Northwest 
forfeit. 

The Cougars used all of 



was the standout, scoring 26 
points. Dave Morelad came 
off the bench to add 19. The 
Tuskers were led by Charlie 
Martin's 22 points, and Mitch 
Easterly added 16. Helmer 
and Meyer tallied 13 and 11 
respectively. 

Martin and Easterly 
were named to the all-tour- 
nament team. 

IPFW 117, Purdue North 

The Tuskers, led by Dean 
Putt's 34 point performance 
gained their seventh round- 
ball victory of the season 
dowing Purdue North Central 
117-87 at the Central gym. 

The Mastodons' offense 
got in gear early, jumping out 
to leads of eight and ten 
points before increasing the 
margin to 37-21. The Tusker 
defense relaxed, but the hosts 
still held a 59-46 lead at 
intermission. 

Displaying an intelligent 
offense, the IPFW squad 
continued to dominate play in 
the second half. The visitors' 
from North Central ignited a 



brief rally which closed the 
Tusker margin to seven, but 
were starved off, as the 
Mastodons exploded and in- 
creased their gulge to 30 pts. 
at the final buzzer, 117-87. 

In addition to Putt's 34 
points, Mitch Easterly and 
Charlie Martin tallied 18 and 
13 respectively. Norm Ziegler 
hit six of six field goals for 12 

Mastodons lose in Overtime 

IPFW allowed a nine 
point lead to slip away with 
4 :41 to go, and suffered a 67-64 
overtime defeat at the hands 
of St. Francis in a city college 
basketball game at the 
Central gym. 

Missed foul shots and 
turnovers played the Tuskers 
late in the game, as the 
visiting Cougars tied the 
contest at 55 with no time 
remaining. The visitors then 
outscored the Mastodons in 
the overtime for the victory. 

With Charlie Martin at 
the helm, the Tuskers em- 



ployed a deliberate controlled Tuske 
offense in the first half 
successfully. The IPFW team 
led by seven points at

Women s team to 
host Notre Dame 



By BARRY BLACKBURN 

Notre Dame University, 
traditionally a basketball 
powerhouse, will send their 
women's delegation to the 
Central gym on Saturday 



host IPFW team. 

Last month, the Masties 
thrashed St. Francis for the 
second time this season, 
'75-28. With two convincing 
victories and a narrow defeat 
i the squad's credit, Coach 



afternoon at 2 p.m. to face the Art Johnson is optimistic.

Hockey team splits 
four over break 




ByJIMAMSTUTZ 

The Indiana-Purdue 
Mastodons hockey team pla- 
yed four games during the 
mid-year break and posted a 
1 win, two losses, and one tie 
record but could have posted 
a 4-0-0 record with a little 
luck. In the first game of the 
four, Purdue's late heroics, 
featuring a tying goal by John 
Ossyra with just 40 seconds 
left to send the game into 
overtime, overshaded a fine 
Mastodon effort and gave a 
well earned tie to the Purdue 
Boilermakers. A ten minute 

but no one scored despite 
numerous opportunities for 
both clubs to give the first tie, 
5-5 in the Tuskers young 
history. Johm Zimmerman 
led the scoring parade for the 
Tuskers with two goals and 
an assist. Brother Dick 
Zimmerman also had two 
goals and Luke Fletter 
chipped in with another. 
IPFW scored once in the first 
period, twice in the second, 
and twice in the third. Purdue 
didn't get on the board until 
the 2:45 mark of the second 
period but scored once more 
in the second and three times 
in the third period. 

On January 2, the Tusk- 
ers put out their best effort to 
date to beat the Western 
Illinois Leathernecks 7-3 at 




Gunnar Elliot. The Leather- 
necks had beaten the Masties 
previously at Illinois 7-4 so 
the Tuskers returned the 

The Mastodons and Lea- 
thernecks traded goals in the 
third period with Luke Fletter 
getting another 3-goal hat 
trick to give the Mastodons as 
Impressive 7-3 win. 

Last Friday, the Masto- 
dons had a return engage- 
ment with the Henry Ford 
City College Hawks, this time 
at the friendly confines of the 
Gunner Elliot Ice Arena. 
Previously in Detroit, the 
Hawks plastered the Masties 
11 to 1, hut this time, the 
winner was the same but the 
score a lot different with the 
Tuskers losing a heartbreak- 
er to the Hawks 2-1. Indiana- 
Purdue jumped on the board 
first wit 



games for IP, to give the 
Masties a 1-0 lead at the end 
of the first period. 

Two goals in the span of 
30 seconds of the second 
period gave the game to the 
Hawks despite a tremendous 
effort by the Tuskers. 

The following day, the 
Mastodons traveled to Day- 
ton for an engagement with 
the University of Dayton 
Flyers at a cold Kettering Ice 



Arena. The result was a very 
frustrating loss and left the 
Tuskers with the thought of 
"we wuz robbed." The final 
score was 14-6 in favor of the 
Flyers, but that score does 
not tell the true story. Dayton 
was the first to draw blood 
and did so three times with 
goals at 6:12, 10:28, and 11:09 
before the Masties could get 
untracked. The Tuskers roar- 
ed back with two goals in the 
span of l : 10 to get back in the 
game at the end of the period 
with the score standing at 3-2. 
At the start of the second 
period, the Mastodons were 
flying. John Zimmerman took 
the opening faceoff from 
brother Dick around the 
defense to tie the score just 6 
seconds into the period. 
Twenty-five seconds later, 
Zimmerman (John) passed to 
Mike Fish who put it in the 
twine and gave the Masto- 
dons a well deserved 4-3 lead. 
Just 2: 14 later, the Mastodons 
downfall came. Tim Nicode- 
mus, playing a fine game in 
goal, was blocked out of a 
play which tied the score. 
After a vocal discussion with 
the official, Nicodemus was 
awarded a misconduct pen- 
alty. 

The third period belonged 
to the Flyers, with only Mike 
Fish's third goal of the day, 
an unassisted effort at 12:56, 
able to save some face for the 
Mastodons. 



really think that for the first 
time this year the team is 
coming together as a unit." 
The Tuskers are nearly 
averaging double their op- 
ponent's score. While the 
opposition has averaged 32 
pts. a game, the IPFW squad 
has accululated 63 pts. per 
contest. The Masties have 
managed only a 29 percent 
field goad figure, which 
Coach Johnson fells "should

Local sports a change off pace 



the way, moment of reflection 
seems appropriate this time 

Analysis and excuses for 
the so-called "major" athle- 
tic events being old hat, a look 
at local sports seems to be a 
refreshing change of pace, 
especially when viewing the 
fine performances turned in 
by our IPFW squads. 

The men's basketball 
team has been victorious in 
eight of the last ten outings.

This is a distinct turn-around, 
since the Tuskers had prev- 
iously lost six in a row earlier 
this season. IPFW now owns 
a season record of 9-8. This 
week the team hosts the 
University of Michigan at 
Dearborn on Friday at 8 p.m., 
then travels to Indianapolis 
on Saturday to face the 
IU-Purdue squad there. 

The hockey team rounds 
out the second half of 
Friday's athletic double-lea- 
der as they square off against 
the Univ. of Michigan at 
Dearborn at Gunnar Elliot 
Ice Arena. Face off is at 10 
'p.m. 

Luke Fletter and John 
Zimmerman hold scoring 
honors with 13 points apiece 
for the skaters. The Masto- 
dons have been dominating 
on home ice, amassing a 3-1-1 
home record. 

On the women's side, the 
female IPFW basketball 



team has a 2-1 record, and 
will get their first taste of 
University competition on 
Saturday as they host Notre 
Dame at 2 p.m. in the Central 
gym. Huntington College in- 
vades Ft. Wayne on Tuesday 
at 6 p.m. 

And while on the subject 
of women's basketball, the 
Ohio State University, after 
much deliberation dubbed 
their female roundball team 
guide humorously. The new 
name? The "buckettes". 

This writer would like to 
take the opportunity to urge 
fellow students to attend the 
IPFW sporting events and 
support the teams. With the 
men's basketball team on a 
tear, the women's team 
doubling their opponets 
score, and the hockey team 
nearly invincible at home, the 
weeks to come should be 
exciting in the world of sports 
here at IPFW.
