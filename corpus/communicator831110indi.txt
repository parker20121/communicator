Sib It writer 

College faculty and slat! can nllevlale the fear o! lost |ob mobility due to the 
economy, by participating In the National Faculty Exchange Program (NFE) 
which enables Ihern to work at another campus. 

Supported by a prant from [It- Kwnn K'IijijIioh r.-Lir,il,)ii.,ri. the program on a

With X college members so far, Belto Worley, executive director of The 
Nalional Faculty Exchange Program, said, "What We're doing throughout this 
year on a national level li BsUbUiblng the program al (hose campuses. Making 
sure lhal we have policy and procedure and communication techniques down to

The first multilateral exchanges of faculty and slaf I will be made by the 1984*5 

Because no organization on a national level (United States institutions only I has 
developed a program which actually replaces [acuity and staff, Worley said, 
"We're finding that interest is overwhelming-" 

The NFE Program gives member campuses Ihe responsibility of designating 
one person to coordinate locally all (acuity and slaf [interested in exchange. -That 
is Uiestageinthisprogram that all M members ore at right now." Worley said 

She said John Carinplii vice chant eUur fur hniincul alfoir:. mi-ds loappoint.or

Once o local coordinator has been appointed, a statement of policy and

opinion 



Jackson's candidacy 
to benefit nation 



Even though civil rights activist Jesse 
Jackson isn't the first black person in 
history to run for president, his can- 
didacy benefits the United States. 

This isn't an editorial endorsing 
Jackson as the next president of the 
United Slates. 

Jackson, however, should be com- 
mended for his attempt to get many non- 

In the 1976 presidential election, H.4 
percent of the registered voters voted. In 
the 1980 presidential election. 54 percent 
or Ihose registered voted. 

Jackson's chances of being elected 
president areslim. Some Democrats say 
he will split the Democratic parly, which 
will enhance President Reaean's 



chances of being re-elected. 

Jackson, however, said he is forging a 
"rainbow coalition of the rejected that 
will include whites, blacks, Hispanics. 
Indians, Asians, women, young people, 
poor people, gay people, laborers, small 
farmers, small business persons, peace 
activists and environmental is Is." Many 
of these people don't vote and are not 
registered to vole. If Jackson, however, 
gives them a reason to vote and gels 
them involved in the political system, he 
will have gained a major ac- 
complishment — a victory in itself. 

A black man running for president in 
this country 20 years ago was unheard 
of. Now it is reality. The system has 
come a long way.

Gert retires 



In November 1973, Gertrude Brandt 
answered a classified ad that asked for 
someone to supervise student workers at 
the Sweet Shoppe in the Walb Memorial 

Since then, Gert, as her co-workers 
and regular customers call her, has sold 
many M&amp;Ms and chocolate-caramel 
clusters and greeted IPFW students with 
a smile in addition to handling the ac- 
counting for Ihe shop and Ihe game 



For all she has done, we will miss 
Gert. "She's helpful and a lol of fun to 
chitchat with," one of her co-workers 
said. Gert has always been willing to 
help students seeking information about 
Ihe campus. "If there's any question 
about who to see, ask Gert. She knows 
who to talk to." the co-worker said. 

Gerl. who is retiring this year, will be 
honored today in the Music Listening 
Room of the Walb Memorial Union 
between 2 and 3 p.m. Stop by and visit

WHEN ARMY NURSES MOVE, 
THEY TAKE THEIR SENIORITY 
WITH THEM. 



Army nurses are officers. 
They never lose status by 
moving, as so often happens 
in civilian hospitals. 

In fact, the Army encour- 
ages mobility and growth. 
You 're encouraged to continue 
your education in clinical 
specialties such as Intensive 
Care. OR. Pediatrics, OB or 
Anesthesia and to attend 
conferences both inside and 
outside the Army. 

If you have a BSN and are registered to practice in the 
US or Puerto Rico, or you're still a student, talk to an Army Nurse 
Recruiter.
