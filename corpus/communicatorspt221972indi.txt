University presidents address IPU 



Ryan says year to be 
one of strict economy 



Dr. John W. Ryan.presldent 
of Indiana University, on 
September 14 told the 
faculties, students, and 
staffs on the eight I.U, 
campuses that the school 
year will be one In which 
strict economy will be 
exercised to keep expendi- 
tures in line with income. 
In a closed-circuit TV 
address, he also outlined 
nine priorities for the next 
blennlum. These priorities 
are: 

1. Provide a high quality 
study opportunity for the 
continued level of enroll- 
ment at all campuses of 
the University, To do this, 
he said, we must adjust 
for Inflation, Incumber- 
ances, and the approach to 
parity. 

2. Provide just as high 
quality study opprtunltles 
for 10,000 additional stu- 
dents by the second year 
of the blennlum. This, he 
said, requires us to con- 
tinue relative Improvement 
in per capita support for 
regional campuses. 

3. Begin Implementation 
of a new instructional tech- 
nology program (PLATO)" 



which will offer greater 
efficiency and better stu- 
dent learning experience. 

4. Continue to develop 
the public and environ- 
mental academic and ser- 
vice programs throughout 
the state. 

5. Hold student fees at 
present level. This means, 
he added, that we must 
also maintain our level of 
student financial aid and 
continue support of pro- 
grams for disadvantaged 
students. 

6. Continue to develop ex- 
pansion of health science 
training opportunities — 
state-wide medical aid ed- 
ucation, nursing, dental 
and dental auxiliary pro- 
grams, 

7. Permit development of 
the regional campus in 
Columbus as a two-year, 
community oriented pro- 
gram — subject to approval 
of the Higher Education 
Commission. 

8. Renovate physical 
facilities whose continued 
use Is possible but require 
major maintenance and 
safety reconstruction.

Placement 

dates set 

for September 

Indiana-Purdue students 
expecting to graduate In 
December 1972, May 1973, 
or August 1973, are in- 
vited to attend one of the 
three-day orientation ses- 
sions the Career Develop- 
ment and Placement Cen- 
ter has planned for Sept. 
25, 27, and 29. All sea- 
sions will- be held ^ In the 
Main Educational Building, 
with two time periods 
scheduled - noon to 1 p.m. 
(Room G41) and 4:30to5:30 
p.m. (Room G40). ^ 

Bill Heller, Coordinator 
of the Career Development 
and Placement Center, said 
that these orientation s'es- 
slons "are a unique first 
attempt to go beyond the 
normal procedure of sim- 
ply distributing registra- 
tion materials and hoping 
that students can figure out 
how to conduct job inter- 
views on their own. Of 
course, in these sessions 
we'll still pass out regis- 
tration materials, but we'll 
go a lot further by using 
Individuals who are pro- 
fessionally involved in re- 
cruiting and hiring to dis- 
cuss interviewing tech- 
niques and do a 'sample' 
to give students an under-

Shift in 

emphasis 

encouraged 

A shift in emphasis from 
teaching to learning has 
been encouraged by Purdue 
University President 
Arthur G. Hansen In an 
address to faculty and staff 
on campus last Tuesday, 
September 19. 

Dr. Hansen said the 
modern university must 
orient itself tothe enhance- 
ment ofa Etudent'scapacitj 
to mature and his desire 
to learn. He added thatthif 
could only come aboi 
through an attitude stress- 
ing the importance of the 
student in a rapidly chang- 
ing society. 

The president also in 
formed the Fort Wayn^ 
staff of anumber of budge 
changes that would provide- 
more money for I-PU, 

In a casualyetinformatlv 
question and answt 
period. Or, Hansen In 
dlcated that acaden. 
autonomy for local Purdue 
programs will definitely 
come, although it may t 
later than the original tai 
get date of Septembe 
1973. 

He also said that he dl' 
not favor administrativ 
autonomy because of th 
efficiency possible onl 
through centralize! 
institutional management 

Questioned about change: 
In tenure policy, he warnei 
the faculty of rislng-publf 
unrest due to the tendencle 
of tenure to protect in 
competent professors, H 
challenged the faculty t 
pollcs themselves fc 
abuses of this kind.

Campaign '72 

The big campaigns are beginning to roll. Saw my first 
McGovern spot on TV the other night, pleading for more' 
money. 

Even the local campaigns are on the move. With a 
somewhat change in strategy. Congressman Roush has 
taken to the Public Transit Corporation buses. Well, 
this seems to be his new Issue, we need more PTC buses. 
At the same time hIsRepublicanchalienger Allan Bloom, 
lashed out at Roush for his votes in Congress on Issues of 
foreign affairs and military preparedness, votes pre- 
viously upheld by the fourth district voters In a poll con- 
ducted by the Congressman's staff. 

Incidentally, recent polls suggest that the race for 
Pleasant Township Trustee Is going to be the most 
contested in the District. 



Peanuts, light bulbs on sale 

The KIwanis Clubs are selling peanuts to raise money. 
The Lions Clubs are selling light bulbs and the United- 
Fund needs your donations. So, if you have a few shillings 
left after taxes, donate to one or more of these groups. 
They will do more good with the money they receive 
than our public officials could do with twice that amount. 

Thruway to open 

The controversial Baer Field Thruway Is scheduled 
CO open this weekend. The Thruway, connecting the 
airport with Fairfield Avenue, has been under criti- 
cism from its Inception. 

Possibly in the very long run this will be to our ad- 
vantage, but to find justifiable reasons for its exist- 
ence now are few and far between. So, enjoy your trip 
t the airport, folks, it now saves you a few minutes, 
but the cost was something else. 

Taxes, taxes , taxes 

News from the County Auditor's office is that some 
1973 city taxes wIU be lower than 1972. Those living 
outside Fort Wayne, however, will see an increase in 
their taxes. 

Wayne Township, showing a decrease of 21 cents per 
$100 assessed valuation. Is the only township with a 
reduction. Pleasant Township is up 29 cents per $100 
assessed valuation, St. Joe Township is up 3 1 cents. 
Communities outside Fort Wayne such as Grablll, 
Woodburn, and Huntertown are up at least 41 cents, 
with GrabiU up $1,30 and Huntertown, 5i;39 per $100 
assessed valuation. With the tax rates increasing as 
they are and with Interested parties pleading for more 
^ and more, the result will be even more taxes unless a 
general sentiment is felt from the tax-paying public. 
This steady increase, year after year, has got to stop. 
The burden of taxpaylng has to be reduced. Cries of 
red-'stribution and fancy tax schemes will not elevlate 
the cost, only gloss it over. Spending has to be cuti

No lounging 
unless you lecture 

One problem that has come up with the opening of the new 
bulldloge concerns leisure time. Where do people go when 
they have a few minutes of spare time between obligations? 

Ideally, students will spend their time In the Student 
Lounge and In the Union when it opens. Most students do. If 
they have anhour or more of freetlme. But what of the stu- 
dents who have 10 or 15 minutes between classes in Build- 
ing A.' 

There is a lounge In Building Alhatls primarily intended 
for faculty and staff housed Inthat building. The thinking is 
that staff should not have to run to another building for a 
15 minute coffee break. 

Yet for some odd reasonstudents with the same amount of 
free time are expected to find another building to spend It 
in. This, at least, is the opinion coming from one of the 
faculty senates and an academic dean last week. 

Many other people on campus remember that lounge be- 
ing Intended for anyone who wants to sit down for a couple 
of minutes. 

In spite of these others, the dean and senate involved de- 
cided It was time to further segregate faculty and students. 
It seems the faculty must not be forced to associate with 
students except on a superior-Inferior basis in the class- 
room. 

All of this reminds us of an old Joke that goes something 
like this: 

"Whv do the faculty need a separate dining room?" 

"Have you ever seen the faculty eat?" 

The Dual University 

Unification, . two 
success prerequisites 

In the past few weeks this column has pointed out some 
problem areas caused by a dual administration at I-PU. 
The Intent was not to propose band-aid remedies for the 
individual situations, but to show that two administntions 
just cannot effectively serve our needs. 

The only solution for the respective Boards of Trustees 
and the Higher Education Commission istom-'ke t unique 
entity: Indiana-Purdue University. Of course, this will pro- 
vide for a single administration. 

It Is pleasing to see the Purdue Faculty Senate feels the 
same way as we do. Yesterday, It passed a resolution call- 
ing for this unification. 

As we see it, there are two major considerations thut 
must be Included in any resolution of the problem, rhe 
faculty resolution proposes one; the other It ignores. 

l-lrst of all, any new arrangement for I-PU must be pro 
posed from the I-PU family. In other words, a local cnm - 
mittee of the faculties and student body must be the inlri-jl 
step in the unification process. Local administrative input 
is also needed. 

It Is almost Impossible for any planconceivedbytheHEC 
and compromised on the General Assembly floor Isdoom- 
ed to failure. We have lived with the old and we must live 
with the new; therefore we best know the problems and the 
acceptable solution. 

There Is little disagreement In the I-PU community onthe 
first point. The second point Is much morecontroverslal 

For the new administration to be truly effective it must be 
a unique I-PU administration. That Is. it must not be Ind- 
iana or Purdue. There must be no RCA Office It must ans- 
wer to. 

It Is time [hit Ft. Wiyne stops being a colony of Bloom- 
Ington and/or Lafayette. I-PU should be an autonomous cam- 
pus accountable directly to the respective presidents ind 
not to half a dozen RCA deans. 

To be sure, both ins-Itutlons disclaim any compatabiliry 
with the other's philo.^ophy or management. The student 
body has drawn from the strengths of both institutions; it 
is fair to expect the administration todo the same

Opinions expressed In the Editorially Speaking column 
are those of the editorial staff. We recognize the re- 
sponsibility to print differing opinions. 



More and more It Is be- 
coming clear that the mi- 
norities can find a place in 
"the establishment." It is 
also being learned that self- 
Identity need not be sacri- 
ficed In finding that place. 
Indeed, by developing the 
"establishment skllls,"the 
minority member is en- 
suring his ability to fight 
for his right to be himself. 

One thing that is necessary 
for the advancement of mi- 
norities Is the development 
of political leverage (pow- 
er). This cannot be seined 
so long as one party can 
take the minorities for 
granted and the other side 
can ignore them. The recent 
increase In their political 
awareness and partici- 
pation hat. brought some 
benefits to the minorities, 
but too often thehenefits 
have been short range and 
tokun. The reason for such 
-superficial benefit;; is that 
unc-.slded politics I partici- 
pation doca little more thiin 
reinforce on-j;oing pol- 
icies. 

What is needed is bi-par- 
tisan participation by min- 
orities:. If the Republicans 
bcRin to feel that they can 
hope to gain by providing 
opportunities for minori- 
ties, perhaps they will be- 
ain to make some changes 
favorable to minorities. At 
the same time the Demo- 
crats will begin to realize 
that they can no longer take 
the minority vote for grant- 
ed, and they will also learn 
that campaignpromi- 
ses cannot be met by a few 
high visibility token minor- 
ity appointments and no ac- 
tion. 

It is well known that the 
politician Is a person who, 
by definition. Is seeking to 
reflect and represent the 
opinion of his constituency. 
But, the constituency view 
that will be expressed will 
be that which represents 
the most "clout," As 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
once told a lobbying group 
that had just made a per- 
suaslve presentation 
"Okay, you have convinced 
me. Now, go out and put 



some pressure on me." In 
other words, the public of- 
fice is a public trust and 
must respond to the public 's 
needs. 

We cannot, however, ex- 
pecttobeheard Just be- 
cause we have legitimate 
needs. Ademocracyia 
structured to respond to 
those who make their needs 
known, and make the solv- 
ing of those needs ne- 
cessary, We need to make 
the threat of witholdingour 
votes credible. We need to 
have recourse when politi- 
cians don't keep their word. 
.5n short, we have to learn 
to play politics. 

The doors to the Demo- 
cratic Convention were n 
pened to the minorities be 
cause of the efforts of the 
minorities themselves, jnd 
not because of any benevo- 
lent interest on the parr of 
the Democrats, The doors 
of the Republican party can 
be opened by together mi- 
norities i n t hcsa me way. 
How much easier it is to in- 
fluence decisions from the 
inside of a group. 

In the past the minorities 
hi'ive been led by dissat- 
isfied dropouts from the 
establishment culture. 

They made us believe what 
only applied to themselves: 
They said that if we got 
Inside the establishment we 



would be sell-outs to "the 
cause," What these guilty- 
conscience - malcontents 
meant was that if they 
learned to function wlTfTTn 
the establishment they 
would forget their tempor- 
ary devotion to the poor, 
drop their assumed minor- 
ity Identity, and go back 
to where they came from. 
The minority person does 
not face this danger be- 
cause he does not have the 
luxury of being other than 
what he is. 

Total one-party backing of 
any candidate allows that 
party to take the minority 
for granted if it wins, and 
makes the opposition feel 
no obligation to the minur- 
ity if it lose.s, Bl-partlsan 
involvement will benefit e- 
very member of every mi- 
nority regardless of which 
party the minority member 
.■delects.

...a tiresome adventure 

whereby many students made new acquainlJinces besides receiving numerous blisters. 



BookWalk is. 



For manypeople who were 
involved in the bookwalk, 



the experience will be very 
beneficial, A lot ofnewfri- 




...a tub full of laughs 

for industrious Circle K, who came in second place for 
most, trips made. Roger Montgomery (In the tub) com - 
plete^MTiore trips (75^-eiianany -other individual,' 



ends were made and a gen- 
eral feeling of togetherness 
seemed to pervade the en- 
tire campus for a day. Ev- 
erybody seemed to have 
gotten involved at one time 
or another, although the ap- ■ 
pearance was a lot more 
encouraging than the fact. 
But, nothing worthwhile 
ever gets done without 
some opposition. 

Walkers included folks as 
young as two year old Tami 
Hoatman who walked all the 
way with her book and may 
well have made more than 
one trip since she was just 
getting started when I saw 
her. Walkers also included 
Dean Gilbert's son and fa- 
ther, gaining for him the 
honor of having the most 
generations involved, along 
with his very impressive 
total of 23 trips. Linda Mc- 
Cain of Geology Club led 
the girls at the end of the 
first day with 28 trips, 
while Roger Montgomery 
(Circle K) travelled 46 
rounds by the end of his day. 
The Geology Club led the 
groups with 650 t r 1 p s a- 
gainst Circle K's 493 and 
APO's 423. These are not 
final scores. We'll have 
those after the walk is com- 
pleted and report them next 
week, 

I was the real winner, 
though, since I got to sit and 
rap with the pretty Miss 
June Thalacker who was 
gracious enough to provide 
me with the statistics. June 
had been trying for twenty- 
three trips in honor of her 
next birthday, but her feet 
decided that she wasonly 
21. 




...a stack of books this high 

which caused a lot of tired muscles and aching backs. 




...a group experience 

for Geology Club members, who earned first prize for 
making more trips than any other campus orginization.

Student Services 



Indiana- Purdue expands placennent 

An interview with W.G. Heiler, Coordinator of Career Development and Placement 



Q: Mr, Heller, Jiow long 
has there been placement 
services at I-PU? 
A: There's been a cen- 
tralized placement office 
of sorts since July of last 
year. At that time we at- 
tempted to institute a cen- 
tralized placement office 
and had requested that at 
least one Individual be as- 
signed on a fuli-tlme basis 
to thatofflce. Unfortunately 
financial considerations 
made this an Impossibil- 
ity so we got the central- 
ized office over In Room 
104 in the Student Services 
a rea but had two indivi- 
duals coordinating activi- 
ties each on pretty much 
of a half-time basis. 

Q: Then there has been 
no centralized placement 
effort until this year. 
A: Yes. I think a brief 
history of the placement 
activity on this campus re- 
veals that placement has 
been one of those things 
handled on a very informal 
and fragmentalbaslsby and 
large. Certain areas saw 
fit to Institute fairly vig- 
orous placement pro- 
grams, for example the 
Division of Business and 
Economics, Whereas other 
areas chose to Ini- 
tiate placement activity on 
pretty much a department- 
al basis. The reason that 
this occurred w^s: some 
time ago, befort I came 
to Fort Wayne, the person 
who coordinated Placement 
was also In charge of fi- 
nancial aids. And In the 
past three years financial 
aids has been an area that 
has just exploded. With 
the'economic recession and 
the difficulty students have 
faced In finding summer 
jobs, this has been an area 
that grew wildly and It be- 
came just impossible for 
the Individual in charge of 
placement and financial aid 
to handle placement effec- 
tively. So it was kind of a 
natural accumulation of e- 
vents which led to the cen- 
tralized placement office 
being the best way to handle 
Che job. 

Academic 

Q: Are there academic 
areas that still handle their 
own placement? 
A: Yes, there are. At 
this point simply because 
we are unable to cover this 
kind of activity from a 
staffing standpoint, edu- 
cational placement is an 
irea in which we really 
lon't get Involved. The 
U students still work 
hrough Charles Hampel 
ii the Division ol Educa- 
:lon. And those Purdue 
students who are educa- 
-lon majors can pick up 
.'eglstratlon forms from 
jur placement office here 
ind we simply forward this 
nformatlon to the educa- 
lonal placement office In 
.afayette. 



Q; Can we assume that 
you are primarily con- 
cerned with business and 
technology students? 
A; I won't say that we 
don't try to place students 
in other majors. Our pri- 
mary Identity Is with busi- 
ness and Industry. Now, 
any student regardless of 
his major. Is welcome to 
utilize the placement ser- 
vice that we have here 
for seeking jobs primarily 
in this business and In- 
dustry area. This Is where 
we've grown up; this is 
where our primary place- 
ment emphasis has always 
been; this Is where mast of 
the jobs are. So we will 
aid any student In any major 
who has an Interest In being 
placed In this area, [think, 
as time passes and we can 
enlarge our staff and de- 
velop appropriate pro- 
cedures, we anticipate get- 
ting Involved In educational 
placement, and making Im- 
provements In the area of 
governmental agency 

placement as well as con- 
tinuing In the business and 
Industry area. 

Q: Do any governmental 
agencies use your office 
at present? 

A: Well, we already do 
have a few governmental 
agencies coming In. By 
and large they're looking 
for business admini- 
stration or technical 
people. But there are a- 
gencles , like the Depart- 
ment of Health, Education 
and Welfare, which could 
use people from science 
backgrounds, social sci- 
ences, and humanities, but 
who do not send repre- 
sentatives to this campuS 
simply because we have ne- 
ver been able to generate 
enough student Interest to 
make a campus visit worth- 
while to them, I hope that 
through this interview 
people in the academic a- 
reas I mentioned will rec- 
ognize that there Is a place- 
ment office here and that 
there is a demand for them. 
As much as we can we will 
attempt to provide services 
to students In these areas. 
But right now I'm the only 
individual involved in 
Placement here, I don't e- 
ven have a secretary on a 
full-time basis, and, 
frankly, it's going to be a 
few years before we can 
offer a function that can ful- 
ly represent one whole stu- 
dent body. 

Q: Do you deal at all with 
part-time jobs? 
A: You're talking about 
work and study programs, 
cooperative programs. At 
this point the placement 
office does not get involved 
in these at all. These are 
set up by people in the 
academic departments. If 
an employer wants to be in- 
volved In a cooperative 
program, and wantstocon- 
duct interviews on campus 




to select cooperative pro- 
gram individuals, we will 
set up the Interviews and 
do all the paper work in 
that respect. Otherwise In 
determining course e- 
quivalences and what ex- 
periences are relevant for 
credit, we don't get in- 
volved at all. 

Q: When vrill the placement 
season begin? 
A: The Placement Office 
has planned two three-day 
orientation sessions for 
Sept, 25, 27, and 29, At 
these sessions, placement 
registration materials will 
be distributed and place- 
ment procedures will be 
discussed, Inadditlon, I've 
arranged to have profes- 
sional college recruiters 
meet with each of the ses- 
sions to discuss interview- 
ing techniques and do a 
short. In-class Interview. 
There is a more complete 
discussion of the orienta- 
tion sessions elsewhere In 
this issue of The Commu- 
nicator, 

Q: How does a student 
register with your office? 
A: Very simple. We have 
a few forms the student 
can fill out. We ask that 
the student provide us with 
what we call a college re- 
sume; a data sheet about 
his college experience, his 
past work experience and 
so on. We ask students 
to provide us with 30 cop- 
ies of the resume so that 
we can distribute copies 
to employers who inquire 
about students with certain 
backgrounds, and we'll 
have copies that we can 
distribute to academic de- 
partment heads, so that on- 
ly placement service that 
would still be coming from 
that end would still be a- 
vailable to the student. 



Q: How do you schedule 
Interviews for students? 
A: All of the employers 
are scheduled to come In 
during specific Interview 
periods for campus re- 
cruiting. Any student who 
is registered with the 
Placement Office can come 
in, and, starting about three 
weeks prior to the 
Interview date, sign up with 
an employer that he Is In- 
terested in. This Is on 
a first-come, first-serve 
basis for specific interview 
time slots, 

A: We do. It's not any- 
thing we require; this is 
voluntary. We encourage 
students to come and talk 
about their career think- 
ing, the ways they want to 
go about looking for a job. 
We're supposedly special- 
ists and we're capable of 
advising students as to 
writing letters of applica- 
tion, writing resumes, and 
choosing appropriate 

places to write and visit for 
interviews. Even though 
many of these employers 
will not be coming on cam- 
pus, we realize, as have 
placement offices every- 
where, that placement Is 
not something the Place- 
ment Office is directly In- 
volved In for anymore than 
40,50% of the students who 
register for placement 
services. The placement 
Office can't really claim 
that the student got a job 
directly because of the 
Placement Office'seffons. 
The Placement Office 
wants to find out what's 
happened to I-PU gradu- 
ates. This is why job- 
seekers and graduate 
school candidates alike are 
asked to register with the 
Placement Office. Only by 
collecting placement data 
can we find out If our aca- 



demic programs are: ef- 
fective and/or needed. 

Q: How many students were 
placed last year? 
A: Last year, as I recall, 
approximately 115 people 
were placed. We had on 
the order of 170 reg- 
istrants. 

Q: That's not a bad aver- 
age. 

A: Well it's not a bad 
average and we know there 
are others who have been 
placed, but have not both- 
ered to report this fact 
to us. This Is one of the 
probitams of getting star- 
ted. We want to collect 
information, but until we 
can offer effective services 
we will be unable to col- 
lec t that Information we 
need. 

Companies 

Q: Could you give ex- 
amples of some of the com- 
panies that deal with the 
Placement Office? 
A: The Internal Revenue 
Service, Magnavox, Gener- 
al Telephone, etc. These 
are companies that set up 
campus recruiting dates. 
We also have employers 
that write or call in for 
placement service, 

Q: How do you handle 
the "call-In" companies? 
A: When they call in, 
we ask them to send some 
company literature that can 
be referred to by students 
interested in that company. 
By and large, these firms 
that call In are smaller 
organizations that just 
don't have the wherewithall 
to engage In campus re- 
cruiting,

Student-minister sees place 
for Christianity in today's world 



In today's world-one of 
science and technology-Is 
there a place for God and 
Christianity? This age-old 
question has been discussed 
and re-discussed over 
many a cafeteria table, but 
agreements have seldom, If 
ever, been reached. 

When asked this same 
quest on, the Rev. R. Ste- 
phen Newnum replied: "De- 
finitely. Science can and has 
brought us modern-day mi- 
racles. It has also given us 
weapons that can kill mass- 
es at a time, drugs that can 
cripple or kill minds and 
bodies. We need a system 
to determine how we are go- 
ing to use our scientific 
knowledge. I think Christ- 
ianity Is that system." 

The 21-year-old Rev. 
Newnum, In addition to 
being Pastor of the Wood- 
burn United Methodist 
Church and the Maples Uni- 
ted Methodist Church, Is a 
student at Indiana-Purdue 
University, where he Is bet- 
ter known as just "Steve, " 
Steve Is I n h i s fourth year 
of studies here, where he Is 
majoring in philosophy and 
minoring In mathematics. 
Now a pre-minlsterlal stu- 
dent, he began his studies 
in the area of computer 
science, but "...after much 
thoughtful consideration on 
my part and talking to my 
pastor," he decided to be- 
come a minister, 

Steve became Pastor of his 
two churches at the begin- 
ning of June. Wltha License 
to Preach, he is qualified to 
perform all of the duties of 
an ordained minister except 
the sacraments (baptism 
and communion). Explain- 
ing how he got his present 
job, Steve said, "Thlsarea 
needed pastors, and since I 
was quallfledandavallable, 
1 was appointed." 
Next fall, Steve plans to 
attend the United Theologi- 
cal Seminary In Dayton, 
Ohio, during the week, and 
serve Che church on the 
weekends. There he will 
work toward his goalofbe- 
c m I n g an ordained min- 
ister and serving In parish- 
es. "I would like to work 
with senior high school 
youth," he reflects, "as I 
feel this Is the time that they 
are really deciding for 
themselves what to make of 
their lives." 

'A challenge' 

How does It feel to be 21, 
a senior in college, and a 
minister? "It's quite a 
challenge to keep up your 
school work and-also to 
minister effectively to two 
different churches. But I 
lenjoy It very much" the 
Rev, Newnum confides. 

Turning his attention to 
his personal religious be- 
liefs, Steve said, "I would 
place myself in the liberal 
camp..,i believe In situa- 
tional ethics and in trying to 
realize each person's full 
human potential. I feel that 
this is the direction of 
Christian living." 




Rev. R. Stephen Newnum, 
better known as "Steve" 



Jesus movement 

Commenting on youth and 
Che Jesus movement, t h e 
young minister said, "I 
think that many youth are' 
looking for ways to escape 
this modern, hlghlycom- 
plex world. Drugs and sex 
are ways to do this. Unfor- 
tunately, simplistic, 
religion can become Just 
another escape path. 
Christians, and all persons, 
need to confront the world, 
promote the good It has to 
offer, and then work to eli- 
minate the evil that is pre- 
sent, whether It be wars, 
drugs or poverty." 

"There are just too many 
people in the Jesus Move- 
ment that are using It to es- 
cape today's problems. 

They answer the problem of 
war by saying It will always 
b e with us, instead of work- 
ing to overcome It. When 
faced with problems, In- 
stead of trying to solve 
them they ignore them and 
state 'Praise the Lord.' 

"I am not criticizing con- 
servative religious beliefs. 



but I am crltlslzlng a belief 
that Ignores the world and 
its problems." 

Colleagues react 

How do colleagues react 
when they discover that the 
bearded, blue-jeahed young 
.nan is a minister? "Most 
people are surprised, at 
least at first. Many people 
feel that a pastor must fit 
into their stereotyped role. 
I don't alwaysdothls. Some 
people are happy that I don't 
fulfill these expectations. 
Others are disappointed 
that I don't. I try to be my- 
self, not someone else's 
Idea of what I should be."

Placement ... 

(Cent, from page 6)- 

Q: How many companies 
are represented in the 
placement library? . 
A: I would estimate that 
probably we have on the 
order of 200 companies 
represented in our library. 
Of these,' about 55 or 60 
recruit on our campus. 
Q: Are there any aca- 
demic classes that deal 
with finding a job? 
A: Right now we have an 
academic class set up for 
business administration 
students called "Personal 
Adjustment to Business." 

Q: Is this class open to 
all students? 

A: It is open to all stu- 
dents, but few outside of 
business know of it. That 
Is why we are initiating 
these orientation sessions 
(see above). 

Q: What does the future 
hold forplacementatl-PU? 
A: Well, I foresee, if fe- 
males are available, dra- 
matic growth In this area. 
We would like to get into 
actual career development; 
that Is, gettlngahold of stu- 
dents while they are fresh- 
men and sophomores and 
developing special Infor- 
mational programs to help 
them find the occupation 
they want. 

Another area of growth 
is adding to the staff so 
that we can specialize In 
specific areas, for In- 
stance, educational place- 
ment. I would anticipate 
that three years down the 
road we will have two or 
three full-time profession- 
als in placement. We will 
need an expanded staff to 
prevent the Placement Of- 
fice from becoming ah'gh- 
ly automated place, where 
students are merely a file 
number. 




'Through a Glass Darkly' 
shown today on campus 



Ingmar Bergman' s A- 
cademy Award-w inning 
film, "Through a Glass 
Darkly," will be sTibwn to- 
day at I-PU. Showings will 
be at 3:30 -p.m. in Room 
107 of the Main Educational 
Building and at 5:30 and 
8:10 p.m. in the auditorium 
of Building A. 

"Through a Glass Darkly" 
Is a psychological drama 
of a young woman's plunge 
Into madness. The film 
describes 24 hours in the 
life of a family on an iso- 
lated Island. The father 
(Gunnar Bjornstrand) is a 
writer who has neglected 
his family for his art. He 
observes, with the detached 

eye of a novelist, that his 



daughter Karin (Harriet 
Andersson) Is an incurable 
schizophrenic and so re- 
cords her illness in his 
diary, which is discovered 
by Karin and accelerates 
her descent to insanity. 
The 90-mlnute, black and 
white film Is a 1961 re- 
lease. It won the American 
Academy Award for best 
foreign language film and 
also Sweden's Academy A- 
ward. 

The film is one of a series 
being sponsored on campus 
this year by the Student 
Government, Admission Is 
free to campus activity 
card holders and '^i per 
person to the public. 



lU enrollment up 
over last year 



Preliminary fall enroll- 
ment figures show Indiana'^ 
University's state - wide 
total is 67,907, i gain of 
4 59 students (.7 per cent) 
over last year. President 
John W. Ryan announced 
today. 

Late registrations are 
expected to revise the 
figures slightly upward, he 
said. 

President Ryan said that 
Increases were recorded 
on five of the eight 
campuses, while three 
showed slight declines 
from last year. 

The I.U. president said 
that for the last five 
years, the institutions en- 
rollment projections — the 
basis upon which budgets 
were built — have been ac- 
curate, but this year's en- 
rollment Is below antici- 
pated. In view of this ex- 
perience, he said, this ' 
year's enrollment seemsto 
have been affected by special 
or temporary factors. It 
seems unllkeij, he added, 
that they will alter the long- 
range planning for the de- 
cade ahead. 

Even though enrollment is 
up. Dr. Ryan said, a study 
is being made to analyze 
why the Increase was not 
as much as anticipated. 
Belt tightening throughout 
the I.U, system Is indicat- 
ed, he said. 

Budgetary plans had been 
predicted on a state-wide 
enrollment of 71.585 for 
this year, or 3,678 more 
students than have so far 
been accounted for, a diff- 
erence of 5.1 per cent. 

Following are the 
preliminary totals by 

campuses as of Sept. 8: 

Bloomlngton, 30,836, up 
118 students (.3 per cent). 

lU-PUI (Indianapolis) 
16, /yz, up 212 (i.a per cent). 

South Bend, 5,295, down 
150 (2.8 per cent). 



Northwest (Gary), 4,784, 
up 30 (.1 per cent). 

Fon Wayne, 4,634, up 
232 (5.3 per cent). 

The Fort Wayne totaldoes 
not include 2,795 I-Pu stu- 
dents registered with Pur- 
due. 

Southeast (Jefferson- 
viUe), 2.730, up 41 (1.5 per 
cent). 

Kokomo, 2,112, down 6 
(.3 per cent). 

East (Richmond) 698, 
down 18 (.3 per cent). 

EvansvUle (one class), 26, 
unchanged. 

"Naturally, the short-fall 
In the predicted enrollment 
will put an economic bur- 
den on all campuses," Dr. 
Ryan said. "One of the 
sources of income upon 
which the budgets were 
figured Is the fees paid 
by students. Administra- 
tive officers on aUcamp- 
uses have been instructed 
to keep operation costs In 
line with actual Income." 

(Fees at Bloomlngton a- 
mount to$325per semester 
for In-state students, and 
$745 for out-of-state stu- 
dents. Fees at the other 
campuses are $20 per 
semester hour for In-state 
undergraduate students and 
$40 per semester hour for 
out-of-staters.) 

Dr. Ryan pointed out that 
the portion of the biennial 
operating budget paid by 
student fees has risen from 
14 per cent in 1962 to 27.5 
per cent this year. 

"Thus," he said, "while 
enrollment is up, the fact 
that enrollment did not rise 
as much as predicted calls 
for stringency in all de- 
Dartments. "

Amboy Dukes play 
at Embasssy Theatre 



by Dave Hill 



One of the few rock con- 
certs at the Embassy The- 
atre downtown took place 
last Monday night. Head- 
lining the bill were the 
Amboy Dukes, with a sup- 
portint; cast of Catfish and 
the Mike Quatro Jam Band. 

The Amboy Dukes were 
the main reason t attended 
this concerc. 1 figured it 
might be worth the $3,50 
price of admission to hear 
"Journey to the Center of 
the Mind" if the Amboy 
Dukes decided to play It. 
As it turned out, iod Nu- 
gent, their resident super- 
star, decided it was be- 
neath him to play his old 
hit single. 

Catfish opened the show. 
They turned our to he x 
"boogie" band from De- 
troit that did a good job 
of warming up the crowd 
for the next two band.'a. 

Their last two numbers 
were the best they did. 
But due to a time shortage 
they couldn't do an encore. 
The emcee told the crowd 
that Quatro and the Amboy 
Dukes would more than 
make up for this. They 
didn't. 




The Mike Quatro Jam 
Band took the stage next. 
I hesitate to call it a band, 
since It consisted of Mike 
Quatro, a drummer, and a 
wall of amps, lights, and 
electrical equipment. Qua- 
tro plays the piano, moog, 
and organ in his act. I 
spent most of my time in 
the lobby while he was on 
stage playing with his syn- 
thesizers. The only thing 
he did that I liked at all 
was a short rock number 
on the piano. Quatro was 
expected to make a bigim- 
, pact on the music scene, 
but the only Impact I no- 
ticed was the high pitched 
noise that sounded like a 
radio that was off the sta- 
tion. 

I don't like to dwell on 
unpleasant subjects, so all 
I'll say about the Amboy 
Dukes Isthatthey play loud, 
boring, unoriginal rock 
(three guitars and a drum- 
mer), and Ted Nugent Is a 
good guitar player, but not 
a bit better than he thinks 
he Is, 

r liked Catfish better than 
the two big name acts, but 
I'd really rather hear the 
Chosen Few than any of 
these bands. 

The Embassy Is a nice 
place for music, but the 
turnout for this show wasn't 
good enough to indicate 
many more concerts here. 
If tills was any indication 
of future concerts, 1 think 

I could do without them. 
All I can do now Is wait 
for Jethro Tull , coming 
soon to a Coliseum near 
you. 



'Butterflies Are Free'- 
a different love story 



by Mary E. Heck 



"Butterflies Are Free" Is 
a etory of love between a 
young blind man and an In- 
secure, effervescent girl 
who live in the same anti- 
quated rooming house. The 
two are frequently Inter- 
rupted by the fellow's mo- 
ther, an overprotectlve so- 
cialite who refuses to untie 
the apron strings. He had 
loosened them earlier as he 
set out for housekeeping on 
his own. 

The movie's title Is adapt- 
ed from the theme, "But- 
terflies are free, and so are 
we," wtilch is sung through- 
out the production. 

"Butterflies Are Free" is 
a tale and little more, play- 
ing on Individuals' emotions 
and moving its viewers to a 
state of Involvement. 

Two outstanding perform- 
ers play the lead parts In the 
Leonard Gershe story, ty- 
pifying well a young couple 
Involved in a touching, sen- 
sual relationship. 

The part of tri sightless 
young man Is portrayed well 
by Edward Albert (the son 
of Eddie Albert) who Is not 
only handsome but talented. 
Albert plays the most diff- 
icult an'' emotional part in 
the film and comes off well. 

Goldie Hawn plays her us- 
ual role of the "dumb 
blond." Acting as a flighty. 



fickle "woman of today," 
Goldie makes an appealing 
character, even though her 
part is a bit overacted at 
times. 

The role of the stuffy mo- 
ther is perfectly fulfilled by 
Eileen Heckart, w h o p u t s 
the viewer in mind of the 
stereotype "mom." 

The movie, filmed in San 
Francisco and directed by 
Milton Katselas, Is rated 
PG.

Two NFL games slated for Ft. Wayne 

Fritz Steger, president of the soon-to-be Fort Wayne 
Champions pro football team, recently announced that two 
Midwest Professional Football League games will be played 
at ZoUner Stadium in October. The first will come on Sun- 
day, October 15, and will pit the Lansing All-Stars against 
the Columbus Bucks. Then on Saturday, October 28, the top 
two MFL clubs, Indiana and Detroit will tangle. 

Steger commented on the results of the scheduling: "That 
gives me a Saturday night and a Sunday night game in Fort 
Wayne, and it should serve as a gauge to see which night 
would be preferred by Fort Wayne fans next season." Now 
Mr. Steger, wha't you really mean fs that the two tilts will 
allow you to gauge whether ornotanyFort Wayne fans will 
show up for MFL foottiaU, 

Ticket prices areS5inadvanceand$6at the door for g 
eral admission (children half-price). Those prices are q 
steep for the young adult crowd; thus I feel if The F 
Wayne Champions are expectingtodrawthe under 25 cro 
they'd better muster up a student rate like the success 
Fort Wayne Komets have done. 

Midwest Professional Football League action is probably 
weU wonh one's time. But at those prices I know this wri- 
ter would have todiga hole under the Zollner Stadium fence 
aiv(l;^eak in or ?o tp a movie instead. 



Fans watch pro footbaN 

No less than 710,000 fans passed through the turnstiles 
last Sunday to watch pro football kick off another season. 
They saw the winners win convincingly. Atlanta mauled the 
Bears 37-21 and wrecked the coaching debut of Abe Glbron. 
who sulked, "I thought we were ready," Well Abe, it might 
be a long, long season. All you can do is grin and "bear" 
&lt;t, 

Joe Namath and the New York Jets pounded Buffalo 41-24. 
and in New England the Cincinnati Bengals thrashed the 
Patriots 31-7. New England Coach John Mazur offered this 
gem of wisdom, "Whenyoudon't block and tackle, you don't 
win," 

The improved Packers belted the sinking Cleveland Browns 
26-10, The Pack's Polish-born kicker, Chester Marcol, who 
booted field goals of 17, 19, 41, and 49 yards, stated, "You 
can't say field goal in I^olish because they don't play foot- 
ball." 

The first week's action was topped off Monday when th^ 
Vikings played host to the Washington Redskins and suc- 
cumbed 24-21. The game was nationally televised on ABC 
with the "Odd Threesome" again calling the plays. Frank 
Gifford and Don Meredith were not yet in the groove after 
a summer's layoff, but "tell-lt-like-It -is" Howard Cosell, 
fresh from the Olympic battleground and Fruit of the Loom 
commercials, was contributing his, share of jabsandbarbs 
as usual. 

Hoosiers no losers; Purdue nipped 

The Hurryln' Hoosiers came from behind in the fourth 
quarter and won a thriller from the favored Minnesota Go- 
phers 27-23 last Saturday. It was an exciting, well-played 
affair with both teams garnering 400 total yards. Coach 
Pont reflected on his team's play after the contest: "What 
we did today is the hardest thing for a team to do without 
game experience-come back under fire." 

The 18th-ranked Boilermakers were upset by Bowling 
Green 17-14 on a fourth quarter field goal by Don Taylor, 
a freshman yet to attend his first class at B.G, Purdue fum- 
bled six times, andfive of those mlscues were recovered by 
the Falcons. A capacity crowd of 52,000 was on hand at West 
Lafayette. 

Next foes- For Indiana: Texas Christian. For Purdue: 
Washington (15th-ranked in nation). 



Komets' coach in Ontario 

Coach Marc BoHeau of the Fort Wayne Komets has been 
in Brantford, Ontario, for the past ten days attending the 
training camp of the NHL Pittsbucgh Penqulns. The Komets 
are the minor league franchise of sorts for the Penguins. 
Nine Komets are working out at the camp, and Coach Bol- 
leau feelsthat one of them, goalie Paul Hoganson, may make 
the parent club. Training camp for the Fort Wayne club 
will start on Monday, October 2. 



Tuskers 
boast 3-0 
record 



l-P whips St. Francis, 
falls to Manchester 



The Tennis Tuskers upped 
their season record to 3-0 
at the expense of Concordia 
Senior College in a tennis 
match last Tuesday. The 
match was played on Con- 
cordia's courts. 

I-PU's number one singles 
player, Galen Yordy, won 
his first match of the year. 
Other Mastodon singles 
winners were John Saurer, 
Tom White, Dave Busian, 
and Steve Spoltman. 

In doubles the team of Tony 
Valentine and White defeat- 
ed their Concordia oppo- 
nets. The Yordy-Saurer 
doubles match was called 
on account of darkness. 

The Mastodons next play at 
Huntington College on Sat-. 
urday. The results follow:

Indiana-Purdue wtUpped 
St. Francis 5-1 and then 
dropped a 4-3 verdict to 
Manchester in last week's 
soccer action. The Tus- 
kers, now 1-2, will travel to 
St. Joseph's College for a 
tilt tomorrow, and then will 
move on to Ohio State-Lima 
for a match next Tuesday. 

Last Saturday I-PU broke 
p e n a close contest with 
four second-half tallies and 
dumped the Troubadours 
5-1. Phil Roberts scored 
the only first half goal on an 
assist from Steve Salis- 
bury. Then early in the se- 
cond half Steve Tobias 
scored on a Roberts' pass 
to hike the lead to 2-0. At 
4:13 St. Francis tallied 
their only goal on a penalty 
shot. 

But the Tuskers then 
clinched the victory as 
Jerry Hetrick assisted a 
Mark Stiambaugh goal, 
Steve Tobias scored unas- 
sisted, and then helped Phil 
Roberts tally the last goal 
of the contest. 

The Manchester affair was 
decided with 17 seconds left 
on afluke shot. The Spar- 
tans opened up a 3-1 half- 
time lead after capitalizing 
on two penalty shots. To- 
bias turned in theonlyfirst 
half Tusker tally with an 
assist by Jerry Hetrick. 

But then In the second half 
I-PU rallied to knot the 
score at 3-3. AlFIeek con- 
verted a passfrom Dan Op- 
linger and, with five 
minutes left, Tobias again 
solved the Spartans on a re- 
bound shot by Fleek.
