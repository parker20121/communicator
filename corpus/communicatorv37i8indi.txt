Pegine Encourages Motivation 



Audacious, bold, enthusiasts, and 
even brilliant are words that could be 
used lo accurately describe Pegine 
Echevarria. 

Echevarria is a nationally-Known 
motivational speaker who has a long 
enough list of accomplishments and 
awards lo fill an entire book. She has 
been on every major TV and radio 
show across the country, including 
32 appearances on Monte! Williams 
show. All of those accomplishments 
seem nearly impossible for someone 
lo achieve given her upbringing and 
childhood. 

Echevarria points out, "1 started my 
life on the streets of Brooklyn and was 
even in a girls gang as a teen. 1 was 




known as La Loca in school and people 
thought I was crazy. What they didn't 
know is I was acling crazy to make sure 
I was safe. I knew if they were afraid of 
me ihey wouldn't beat me up." 

Echevarria went from La Loca and 
later the star of poker games in bars to 
running a family support center in New 
, York City. She started to get involved 
in Hie lives of girls who were growing 
up exactly how she did. 

"I have been talking my whole life 
and always seemed to be the person 
everyone turned to when something 
needed said. I ran a support center and 
somehow started to get noticed in New 
York for changing the lives of teenag- 
ers from ihe streets.' Echevarria said. 
"One day 1 went to work and had a mes-

A team comprised of IPFW students 
from the computer science department 
recently had the unique opportunity to 
present their semester research project 
lo Northrop Grumman Corporation's 
Information and Cyberwarfare Tech- 
nology Center (I&amp;CTC). 

The self-named Top-Shelf Devel- 
opment learn consisted of sludenls 
Nathan Ycrglcr, Brian Michel, Erik 
Beesley, and Hap Fiandt, The group 
demonstrated the possible abilities of a 
' small platform" robotic system for use 
in I&amp;CTC research. 

Their research project was a part of 
Computer Science 460 Capstone De- 
sign, a course taken by the learn during 
the spring 2O06 semester. 

Specifically, their linal demonstra- 
tion stressed issues relevant lo local- 

and summarized the advantages and 
disadvantages or platforms thai will be 
used by I&amp;CTC in future development 
projects. 

"The key aspeel we were looking at 
was developing software which allowed 



the robots to communicate with each 
olher in order to perform some col- 
laborative task." Nathan Yergler. who 
graduated from IPFW last May, said 
of the research project. "For example, 
an application might be mapping an 
unknown area, where each small robot 
explores lis immediate environment 
and communicates to the other robots 
lo build a larger, more complete body 
of information." 

Yergler, who is currently employed 
as a senior software engineer for Cre- 
ative Commons, believes that the expe- 
rience of being a part of (he Top-Shelf 
Development team will be beneficial 
lo all of its members as ihey enter the 
professional world. 

"It provided some broader experi- 
ence working with a team on a large 
scale project, which is useful." Yergler 
explained. "It also provided us with 
some insight into what we might want 
lo look for and especially avoid when 
evaluating employers."

Voter Registration Drives Drowned Out 

Rain fall and fall break contribute to low registration numbers 






do. Many voters were already 
registered from pusi years, while 
others may have forgotten once 
again. Young voters have been 
the largct for new registration 
for Ihe past few years. The 18 
lo 24 age bracket of registered 
voters has been disappointing 
over Ihe past few years. Many 
campaigns have been directed 
towards these young voters, but 
what point is there in these cam- 
paigns if their target audience is 
not even registered lo vote? 

"I think a lot of students 
don't understand how important 
elections are lo them person- 
ally. They understand the patri- 
otic part of it all, bui Ihcy don't 
know how the races and candi- 
dates can ailed their lives spc- 
cilieally" said Andrew Downs, 
director of Ihe Mike Downs

Colleges ( A ASCU) and co spon-

Tuesday, 

November 7 



the Young Voters Strategic Proj- 
ect organized voter registration 
drives on the IPFW campus car- 
tier this month. 

"This year three drives were 
scheduled and two got rained 
oul and one was scheduled for 
a day that fell into fall break" 
said Downs. Unfortunately be- 
cause of the rain and schedul- 
ing the turnout for the drive was 
less than what many had hoped 
for. "We did not meet the goal 
of 470 and about 61 registered" 
said Downs. 



Oct. 10 was the last day 
for voter registration, but for 

those who did register, there are 
many ways they can become 
more informed. "The Internet 
is one place to find informa- 
tion. Newspapers arc also a way 
to find information about local 
candidates. Students can also 
find information by attending 
a candidate forum and many 
local candidates arc still listed 
in phone book and you can call 
them and ask them questions. 
These people want your vote I 
have found most candidates are 
happy lo talk to people" said 
Downs. 

The drive was not the only 
way all of the organizations 
brought attention to the voter 
registration. "An e-mail was 
sent out to first year students 
encouraging them to vote" said 
Downs. Many first year stu- 
dents are 1 8 and this may be the 
first election they can take part 
in. Even with the low number 
of new registered voters, hope- 
fully those who have n

Close Sheriff Election to be Discussed 




the comer, the air is becoming 

increasingly brisk and the leaves 
are starting to turn from green lo 
vihraui I, ill colors. 



Tina Taviano, and PJ Smith 
are all locked in a tight race for 
sheriff in the upcoming Allen 
County election. 

Fries is the Republican can- 
didate and is a long-time vet- 
eran of Ihe sheriff's department. 
The Republican candidate usu- 
ally has the upper hand when it 
comes lo Ihe Allen County Sher- 
ifl raw, us Republicans have 
held office for over 50 years. His 
biggest push is to issue random 



drug ti 

slaffai 



&gt; all employee 
sheriff depart in 



order lo ensure that the workers 
are drug-free. 

Taviano surprised a lot of 
people when she won the spring 
primary and managed lo gel a 
fairly large amount of public- 
ity in the following months. 
With signs and posters all over 
the county claiming her mission 
statement, she is ready to take 
on the daunting task of being 
the county's sheriff. Her bold- 
est vision is to combine the city 
and county services to allow for 
a more efficient operation and 
also to organize a belter system 
for tracking sex offenders. She 
has taken some bold ideas to 
the public already and hopes lo 
make several changes if she is 
elected. 

With experience in the 
Fort Wayne Police Depart- 
ment. Smith brings the amount 
of know-how needed I 
him into the thick of i 
well. He currently over 
northwest quadrain ui I 



partment and has decided to 
enter the election as an Inde- 
pendent candidate. He most 
likely doesn't have the public- 
ity to launch him to a win, but 
could definitely take votes from 
either Fries or Taviano. 

This election is going to be 
close and could go in favor of 
any of the candidates. 

There will be a virtual town 
meeting held by ACELINK 
and ihe Mike Downs Center on

Department of Computer Science Awarded World-Class Software Package 



Thanks to new slate-of-lhe- 
an software, IPFW's computer 
science students will now be 
better prepared than ever before 
to enter the professional work- 
force after graduation. 

The department of computer 
science has received an award 
package from Telelogic, a com- 
pany that has offices worldwide 
and that is ranked by The Com- 
puter Business Review as one of 
the top ten application software 
development organizations in 
the world. 

"They're one of the biggest 
companies in the world," com- 
puter science professor Robert 
Barrett said of the European- 
based Telelogic. "We're jusl 
thrilled to have it. This is world- 



After applying for support 
from Telelogic *s Education Of- 
fice, IPFW received DOORS 
and Systems Architect software, 
a package valued at SI 82,500. 
For its work on DOORS. Tele- 
logic has won its third inter- 
national Stevie Award for be'st 
product development organiza- 

As of the fall 2006 semester, 
both programs have been incor- 
porated into IPFW classrooms. 

"When you start on a proj- 
ect and there are constantly 
changes, this makes sure you 
don't miss anything." Professor 
Barrett said. "It's an excellent, 
excellent tool."

was. I went on the show and the 
producers loved me. Thirty-two 
shows and an Emmy later, Mon- 
tel sat me down and told me to 
go spread the word. He gave mc 
the inspiration I needed to start 
speaking professionally." 

She is certainly doing some- 
thing right, because she has been 
speaking professionally for ten 
years and isn't letting up. Ac- 
cording to Pegine.com, her of- 
ficial web site, she generally has 
five speech templates that she 
uses for any given audience. 

Some of Echevarria's 
speeches are similar in their con- 
cepts, but most are improvised. 
She has training in improvising 
and uses it in all of her speech- 
es. She will mold and change 
her speech to fit the crowd she 
is directing it to. 

Speaking to a large group of 
college students is a weekly oc- 
currence for Echevarria and she 
offered this advice to any stu- 
dent who is struggling to adjust 
to the hustle of college life. 

"Start every semester by vis- 
iting your professors. You may 
feel like the teacher's pet but 
it really does help. Watch who 
you hang out with because you

like your name, change it be- 
cause nobody wants to hear you 
complain about it. Besides, your 
mom can't say too much about 
it since you are an adult now. 
Lastly, get comfortable being 
uncomfortable. College will bc_ 
awkward at times so you might 
;is well yd used to it." 

Her new book "Sometimes 
You Havc to Kick Your Own 
Butt" is available now and fea- 
tures more than enough motiva- 
tion to get through the day. 



Perhaps her best advice is 
for the guys out there as she 
explained, "The best looking 
and smartest girls are silting at 
home on Saturday nights be- 
cause you are too afraid to ask 
them out. You are in college and 
you have nothing to lose, so go 
right up to that girl and ask her 
out. You may be surprised with 
the outcome."

Since Ray Croc first developed his 
revolutionary idea of duplicating busi- 
ness systems, franchises like McDon- 
ald's have flourished and made many 
business owners very wealthy. This 
same concept works today for people 
willing to put the time and effort into 
creating profitable entities with a large 
market share. Throughout the years, we 
have seen cities like Fort Wayne grow 
economically. By franchising, entre- 
preneurs have the opportunity to create 
solid Imancial futures. 

So what is a good definition of a 
franchise? 

Simply, a franchise is a method a 
company uses to distribute its prod- 
ucts and services through retail outlets 
owned by independent, third-party op- 
erators. This operator then docs busi- 
ness using the marketing methods, 
trademarked goods and services, and 
name recognition developed by the 
company. In exchange, the indepen- 
dent operator pays an initial fee and 
royalties to the owner ol the ti.ini.hisL 



How much are these initial fees and 
royalties? 

Well, il depends on the franchise. A 

company who may have a proven busi- 
ness with less risk will more than likely 
cost more than a small kiosk at the mall. 
For example, a McDonald's franchise 
costs about a million dollars to start up. 
You would need anywhere from a quar- 
ter to half a million dollars ol liquidated 
capital to start this business venture 
From there, about four percent of what 
you make every year will go to McDon- 
ald's, Inc. But, 96% profit is not a bad 
cut when you're dealing with Ronald 
McDonald and his happy meals. 

Now, four percent may not seem 
like a lot of money. Imagine being a 
franchiser, just setting up some of your 
friends with their own franchise. They 're 
all making a lot of money, while you're 
only making a small percentage When 
Ray Croc started McDonalds, his initial 
investors were making a boat load of 
money. However, he still had to make 
milkshakes for years before he became 
one of the richest men alive. These big 
businesses take years to develop, but 
the persistence and perseverance can 
prove to be quite rewarding. 




Censorship Strikes 
Nerve of Student 



I was listening to a podcast the other 
day at work when Hie hostesses began 
talking about censorship. One of the 
casters is from Germany and she said 
that their movies, books, and video 
games are censored it really angers me 
that, in the 21st century, countries are 
stili telling their people what they can 
and cannot read, watch, and play, I'm 
a big girl. If I want to watch something 
that some may think is seedy, that's my 
prerogative - assuming it's not illegal. 
of course. 

I feel like if countries want to cen- 
sor anything, they should be censoring 
the news. Everyday, we're inundated 
with Stories of murder, sexual predators, 
violence, and hate. But it shouldn't be 
mentioned anywhere else. I don't know 
about you, but I'd rather think these sto- 
ries are pretend than be reminded that 
they're real. I check watchdog.com 
like it's my job. And it's not because 
of movies and books. It's because the 
news constantly tells me that a different 
pedophile has raped and killed another 
child. I'm terrified to let my younger 
sister go anywhere without an adult. 



It's not that I don't want to know 
what's going on in the US— and the 
world. But. I don't want the journal- 
ists to decide what 1 know and what 1 
don't. 1 want to know about everything 
ili.u's happen my. not just ihc "juicy" 
stories. 1 don't want to only know 
about crimes. The news is breeding a 
generation of people trained to live in 
fear. Can't we heai about good ihings 
once in awhile? Can't we hear that 
someone helped someone else? Why 
do we only have to hear about death 
and scandal'.' And why. if it's accept- 
able for the news, is u unacceptable tor 
entertainment? Because, ultimately, 
isn't that all the news is: an informa- 
tive form of entertainment? 

I'm not going to sit here and tell 
you that I love watching movies aboul 
murder and sexual deviance. I don't. 
But it should be my decision to watch, 
not my government's. Contrary to 
popular belief, they don't always know 
what's right. Obviously.

Papers and Exams 
Torment Student 



Hell week. We all know it. We

It's when all our big papers are due. 
It's when we have exams in every 
class. It's when we all say, "I'm never 
going back!" 

I have oft wondered if the profes- 
sors sit around and plan their syllabi 
together. Do they do that on purpose? 
Surely to goodness they know thai 
they're making us crazy; that we're 
pulling out our hair and cramming

If There Is Something 
to Say, Say It 



By Stephanie Sample; 



Everyday I hear someone voice (heir 
opinions on the government, and who 
is running it. With voting just around 
the comer 1 wonder how many people 
actually are going to vote in order to 
change what they arc unhappy about. 
I. nionunaicly. many people my age 
have a lot to say, but don't try to do 
too much about it. Let me say I am 
not one of those people who thinks 
ihey know all the right answers, and I 
do not pretend to, but 1 do care. I care 
enough to register to vote, and to take 
time to figure out who I am voting for. 
Because if you don't even know who 
or what you are voting for, then what 

1 wouldn't put myself in one politi- 
cal party. Many of my Iriendsand fam- 
ily may think I belong in a certain one. 
but I never want to vote for the party. 
I want to vote for the person. All of 
my family members do not all belong 
to the same political party, although I 
would sav there are more Republicans 
than Democrats. Thankfully, I can 
have different opinions than my family 
members and that is alright. So many 
of my friends put themselves in a polit- 
ical party just because that's what (heir 
lamily believes. I find this so sad. If a 



person just happens to agree with their 
family, then great, but why do some- 
thing blindly just because your parents 
do. Most of us spend our adolescence 
rebelling against everything that our 
parents think and represent, but when 
it is time to make a grown up decision 
many just follow their parents because 

Whether you vote blindly or in- 
formed it is belter than not voting at 
all. It bothers me that so many people 
have complaints but are too lazy to 
try to change what they don't like. I 
know it is easy to feel like even if you 
vole nothing will change, but it is not 
true. Granted, if someone doesn't like 
President Bush, he or she can not take 
him out of office personally. However 
smaller changes can be made. Voting 
is the way to make these changes. 

I know some of what I am saying 
may seem like common knowledge, 
but so many college students don't 
think about this. Please 1 ask of you, 
my peers, if you have an opinion voice 
it. Don't complain about something 
that you can help change. What is the 
point in having an opinion, if you do 
nothing with if Vote Republican, or 
Democrat which party is not what is 
important. It is important to care, and 
if you don't care, stop pretending thai 
you do. If you care, you will do some- 
thing about it. 



Letter to the Editor 



s Discuss Internet 



I am writing about the recent article 
"Panelists Discuss Internet Privacy" by 
Laura Dumas. This article displays a 
lack of understanding ol constitutional 
issues and misleads readers about the 
meaning of the constitution itself. 
To quote Ms Dumas, 'One of the prin- 
ciple arguments surrounding this issue 
(internet privacy) is whether monitor- 
ing internet activity violates the rights 
given by the U.S. Constitution's Fourth 
amendment, which protects Americans 
from unreasonable search and sei- 

Our rights are NOT given to us by the 
Consiitulion. The founders of this na- 
tion believed that we have rights by 
virtue of our humanity, that we are 
"endowed with certain rights by our 
creator." The Constitution was not 
intended to GIVE anyone rights. The 



reason many of our rights are listed 
in Ihe Constitution is to make it clear 
thai the government is not allowed (o 
lake (hose rights away Basically, the 
purpose of the Constitution is the list 
the things that the government is not 
allowed to do. 

This is a vitally important distinc- 
tion, and it should be made clear to 
your readers. If you believe that ihe 
government GIVES you your rights, 
then you also believe that the govern- 
ment can change the Constitution and 
TAKE THOSE RIGHTS AWAY. The 
truth is, no one can take your rights. 
They can only prevent you from exer- 
cising them. 

Please make this idea clear to your 
readers. The future off this country 
depends upon their understanding of 
what "rights" really are.

Part of the college experience is 
the gym. I have always been a strong 
promoter of exercise. Not only docs it 
help keep you in shape, but it also helps 
to relieve the stresses of school. Be- 
ing a biology major. I ofien find my- 
self stressed by school work and go to 
the Gates Sports Center four nights a 
week. I like the type ot people who are 
at Gates, because they want to belter 
themselves. Thai usually does not just 
apply to the physical aspect, but in all 
aspects of their lives as well. 
I like many oilier aspects of the Gates 
Sports Center as well. I am usually 
greeted by a happy smile and friendly 

presses me when the staff members re- 
member my name and even joke around 
a little bit. 

On occasion, however, being bog- 
gled with schoolwork and having to 
change into gym clothes, I forget to 
bring my student identification card. 
It has never been a problem before, 
because by knowing my name and 
having seen my ID four times a week 
since the beginning o| the semester, the 
attendants usiialh tell rue to bring it 
next time and allow me in. This makes 
sense. If I was a student for the first 
three days of the week, 1 am most likely 
still a student. 

On Wednesday, October 11, I had 
a friend drive me home to change be- 
fore heading to Gates. As usual, I was 
greeted by a beautiful smile and a sin- 
cere greeting, [ then realized I forgot 
my ID, so I apologized and told the 
staff member I would bnng it next time. 
However, tonight she told me I had to 



return home and retrieve it. 

This was not the usual response. I 
was caught off guard and asked "Are 
you serious' 1 ] live far away and I come 
here every night!" I realized her supe- 
rior was standing beside me. Before 
she could reply, a gentleman, whose 
title I can't even understand since he 
has listed every task he is in charge of 
on his card, rudely remarked "Well, 
you have to go home and get it." 

Now, I am a laid back person. But 
like most, I don't appreciate being spo- 
ken down upon. As I see it, the Gates 
Sports Center is not a separate entity 
from the 1PFW academic campus, but 
a part of the whole. Thus, I look at the 
Gates' staff as pan of my community. 
This guy didn't display the same at- 
titude towards my fellow classmates 
and me. In fact, he was very rude and 
aggressive. Most students and staff 
know that if anyone wanted to get 
in, they could just walk around to the 
back door. Yet, he Wanted me to drive 
20 minutes home to retrieve my stu- 
dent ID that I had shown for so many 

When I told him that the other staff 
members allow me in despite forget- 
ting my ID card, he expressed his 
authority over his staff and me by re- 
sponding with "well, those people will 
be reprimanded." 

Now, I am not sure where he re- 
ceived his business or hospitality 
degree, but from my education and 
experiences, I understand that the 
employee or staff of an establishment 
should have a good rapport with the 
guest or client. 

For example, bank I 






sofo 






a student of the IPFW community 
- gym, it is frowned upon for the staff 
to be understanding and logical. 

I am also not one to simply point 
out a problem, but one to work to- 
wards a solution. And it bailies me 
that in a time of such technology, the 
director of so much has not yet imple- 
mented software thai links the Gales 
Sports Center's computers to the main 
network. That way. if a student for- 
gets their card, they can give their stu- 
dent number in place, like most uni- 
versities. The computer could easily 
bring up a picture of the student and 
their enrollment status. This would 
also be a much more productive way 
ol checking out/m towels, basketballs 
and other sports equipment. 

I see from the business card that

gym, and this may be the reason for 
his being rude and seemingly angry 
towards its guesis. A possible solution 
would be to reduce his roles in order to 
offer him some relief. When I spoke 
with some members ot HIS stall, they 
made remarks about his demeanor and 
it didn't lead me to believe he was very 
well-natured and capable of dealing 
with students. With such a great set of 
Student staff members with great ideas 
on how to run a user-friendly, yet pro- 
ductive gym. it's a wonder thai more 
changes are not being undertaken. 

IPFW is a great university, but 
more and more I notice thai portions 
work separately and not as a collective 
unit. Things would run much more 
smoothly if the students and faculty 
worked together for an always grow- 
ing and improving IPFW community.

Arnie's Army 
Takes Two 
on Final Day 
of Can- Am 
Challenge 



Edmonton, Alberta, Cana- 
da - The IPFW men's volleyball 
team evened its record in ihe 
13th Annual Husky Oil Can- 
Am Men's Volleyball Challenge 
with a pair of wins on the final 

The Mastodons topped the 
University of Manitoba, 3-1 and 
then shutout McMaster Univer-

IPFW handled the Bison 
by the scores of 25-18, 25-14, 
2 1-25. and 25-22. 

Led by the usual suspects, 
junior All-America C.J. Macias 
put down 21 kills, had four as- 
sists, and registered four block 

Junior middle hitter Josh 
Stewart blasted 10 kills on 1 1 
swings for a hitting percentage 
of .909. which would have been 
good enough for a new IPFW 
school record had it not been in 
exhibition play. "Big Red" also 
had a block solo and five block

IPFW had no trouble with Mc- 
Master University, beating the 
Marauders by the scores of 25-

The Mastodons seemed to 
put down everything they took a

in the match. 

Again it was Macias lead- 
ing the way offensively with 20 
kills (.593).

Late Goal Salvages Tie for CSU 



Fort Wayne, IN- IPFW got 
a pair of second-half goals, but 
it was a score with just over two 
minutes left in regulation that lift- 
ed Cleveland Stale to a 2-2 lie with 
the Mastodons, on Wednesday 
evening at Hefner Stadium. 

The Vikings jumped on IPFW 
early as senior forward David 
Stewart blasted a shot at IPFW 
keeper Michael Knitter that had so 
much steam, it rolled past the goal 
line, even though it looked like 
Knitter had gotten enough of the 
ball lo make the save. 

The tally at the 17:43 mark was 



the only -cure ot the first half. 

In the second half, IPFW tied 
the mutch at one on a goal b\ lash- 
man defender Mitchell Haiflcy. 
Haiflcy was in the right spot after 4 
a tree kick from senior Barry Mor- 
gan. 

He found hinisdl \\ Mh tin. kill. 
in the box, and pushed it past Vi- 
kings keeper Dan Duric. 

Junior forward Chas Parry ga\ e 
the Mastodons a 2-1 lead at the 
61:37 mark. 

Parry intercepted a clearing 
pass and sent a shot on goal Durk

But, IPFW couldn't seal the 
deal. With just 2:43 left in regula- 
tion. Ncnad Siojkovic hit a streak- 



ing Andrew Gutting and the fresh- 
man went far side from 15 yards for 
the equalizer. 

Neither team could find the 
back of the net in overtime. 

Parry fired off nine shots in the 
match, live on goal. Two of his at- 
tempts ripped the post. 

Stewart and Brian Henson each 
recorded six shots attempts,

IPFW has a few sports that arc 
rarely covered, thus making them 
"lesser-known.'* However, that doesn't 
take anything away from any of these 
teams, which hold their own in com- 
petition. 

Does anyone know, other than the 
team, that the IPFW women's cross 
country team finished 2nd out of 35 
teams last weekend at Disney World, 
being beaten only by BYU7 Or that the 
men finished Klih out of 30 at Disney

tack finally cracked the score- 
board in the 78th minute to give 
the Bison a 1-0 United Soccer 
Conference match win over 
IPFW on Sunday. 

Freshman mid fielder Lor- 
raine Thompson was well inside 
the Mastodons box and chipped 
a shot low to the left hand cor- 
ner for the game winner. 

It was Thompson's fifth goal 
of the season. 

The loss was the second-in- 
a-row for IPFW in USC play. 
IPFW's conference record is 
now 1-2 which will give them 
the #3 seed in the West for the

What happens when you bring 
witchcraft into an entirely male-domi- 
nated episode of "The OC"? You end up 
with Sony Pictures' "The Covenant." 

I saw Ihis movie Imping against Hie 
odds that I would be pleasantly sur- 
prised. Alter all. as cheesy as it was, 
I enjoyed the 1996 movie "The Craft" 
and (his film seemed 10 be along those 
very same lines. Sure enough, it was 
similar in many ways. However, what- 

ago is long gone today, because this 
movie had the opposite effect. 

The story is us follows: In the 1600s, 
five families of very powerful witches 
decided to form a covenant known as 
the Ipswich Colony. They vowed to 
keep their powers secret, but one fam- 
ily, thirsting tor more power, decided to 
break their vows and vanished without 

Fast forward to the present: We 

lind four teenagers attending Spencer 
Academy in rural Massachusetts. In- 
terestingly enough, these are the four 
"Sons of Ipswich" (the dependents of 
the colonists), and each of them has ex- 
traordinary powers Although utilizing 
these powers can yield supernatural re- 
sults, their use becomes more addicting 
and causes the user to age more rapidly 

To top it off. on every witch's 
18th birthday, they ascend to a state 
of greater power and the temptation to 
"use" increases. As Caleb (our protago- 
nist! approaches his day of ascension, 
strange occurrences begin nihiiy up Ictl 
t Spencer Academy. Could

and as ridiculous as it sounds. I believe 
that it could have turned out alright if 
executed correctly. By correctly, I mean 
the opposite of what was actually done. 
The powers that be took this movie and 
made it a cross between a teenage "As 
the World Turns" and "Street Fighter 
2." I'm not kidding. 

One minute, we have young people 
flirting and going out on dates. The 
next minute, we have witches flying 
through the air shooting energy balls at 
each other. 

In an attempt to be positive, this 
film still might have been okay if trie 
acting wasn't awful, the dialog didn't 
sound like it was written by a 10-year- 
old, and nearly every character in the 
movie didn't look like a Barbie doll 
who likes to walk around shirtless. 

I'm being honest when I say that 
the only good parts in this movie are 
shown m the trailer. 

You might have seen the part where 
a car driven by a good witch explodes

"The Grudge 2" Conceptually Frightening 



By Mil;.' Webb 

When it comes to well though! oui 
filmmaking, horror movie:, arc nol of- 
icn Ihe first films that come lo mind. 
Critics always seem to pan ihcm. with 
good reason. 

II seems these days, ihc typical 
Hollywood horror movie is chock full 
of predicluhly uninlelligcnl plots, had 
acting, ■'ml 30 lo 35 -year- old actors and 
actresses playing Ihe roles of 17-year- 
old Barhic dolls. 

It is understandable then why one 
might look to foreign films in an at- 
lempt lo escape the aforementioned 
monotony. 

'The Grudge 2" is the latest cnlry 
in ihc popular horror scries from Japan. 
Known oversees as "Ju-on," this series 
has garnered quite a following around 
the world. 

The "Grudge 2" is actually the 
sixth full-length "Ju-on" movie In he 
released following two television mov- 
ies in Japan, two theatrical releases in 




understand. 

Each movie in (he series explains a 
little more of the big picture, but unless 
one walches them all (Japanese origi- 
nals included) and tills in the missing 
puzzle pieces, there could be some 
unanswered questions in terms of the 
dynamics of the curse and how it came 
be. 

"The Grudge 2" in particular Mils in 
some of the holes quite nicely and lhal 
is one of its strong points. 

Perhaps in an attempt to distinguish 
itself from other "ghost" movies, "Ju- 
on" movies have traditionally jumped 
around, following various characters in 
different lime periods before eventu- 
ally lying them together into one cohe- 
sive story line. 

"The Grudge 2" follows suit, but 
on a slightly larger scale as we are 
now dealing with two groups of people 
- those in Japan and those in America. 

This can be somewhat confusing 
at first, but it is not too distracting and 
eventual!} serves to bring the movie to 



our shores (undoubtedly to make future 

The movie's acting is adequate, and 
it is nice lo see Amber Tamblyn break 
out and play the lead in a movie such 
as this. The presence of Takako Fuji as 
Kayako is also important to note. 

Fuji has played the role of (he croak- 
ing, wide-eyed ghoul in every incarna- 
tion the series has seen thus tar. Seeing 
her reprise her role on these shores is a 
testament to director Takashi Shimizu's 
desire to retain eohesiveness, which is 
greatly appreciated by a fan such as 

Though critics may pan a release 
such as this, both longtime fans of the 
series and newcomers looking for a 
break from typical Hollywood horror 
will find "The Grudge 2" lo be a breath 
of fresh air. That is, if it is embraced for 
what it is supposed lo be - a movie that 
may not make you jump out of your 
seat, but is scary more in concept.

Dressed in flowing green 
with silver sparkles and a dra- 
matic scarf lhal trailed lo ihe 
floor, Kern conquered the piano 
and the audience with her spar- 
kling musicaliiy.

"ll is such a great opportunity

of being an Embassador and

Kern performed Rach- 
maninoff's second piano con- 
certo without music, marking 
the beats wilh her hands when 
she was nol playing. 

She had absolute control 
over ihc music as the final 

lingered, dying away as Ihe au- 
dience strained lo hear ihe lasi 
vestiges of sound. 

The third movement raced 
by, the orchestra responding 
beautifully to Kern's dynamics 
and liming. 

The close of the concerlo 
was fantastic, Ihe audience 
hardly wailing to hear the end 
before standing to applaud. 

Kern look several bows, 
hugging Tchivzhel, and walk- 
ing offstage several limes be- 
fore acccpling an encore. 

The orchestra started part of 
the ihird movement again, and 
Kern dashed through it with 
fascinating energy. She knew

After another round of thun- 
derous applause, Kern played a 
second encore, Rachmaninoff's

cepted the applause, and left the 
stage in a swirl of green.
