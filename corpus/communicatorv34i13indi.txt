Growing Homecoming 



For the third year, the 

Homecoming festivities at IPFW 
grew in numbers and stature. 

And although attendance 
weren't too capacity at every event, 
student organizers were pleased 
with the sustained growth ~ 
believing the traditions began in 
recent years will translate to 
decades of Homecoming celebra- 
tions in the future. 

Homecoming Week was cele- 
brated from Nov. 17 - Nov. 21 on 
campus to coincide with the first 
IPFW men's basketball game on

Friday, Nov. 21 at the Allen County 
Memorial Coliseum. 

In the week proceeding, cam- 
pus activities included 
from "Crazy Hat Day 
And-White Day" in a 
gear up school spirit. 

A full-day of activities was 
slated — and took place •- on 
Friday, Nov. 21. It was "Btue-And- 
White Day" with the colors bright- 
ening the campus. 

ESPN broadcaster and college 
sports legend Dick Vitale spoke to 
IPFW fans, along with the IPFW 
men's basketball team, at a Pep 
Rally that afternoon.. Vitale said he 
could feel the enthusiasm the uni- 



versity has for its sports, and its 
people - predicting the Mastodon 
pride will be a factor for other col- 
leges to deal with in the future of 

He also stressed academic 
achievement during his speech, 
saying he had a 4.0 in college - if 
he combined the 1.0 of his fresh- 
man year with the 1.0s of his soph- 
omore, junior and senior years. 

While that was his humor, he 
did note the importance of a col- 
lege degree in the world of today, 
and paid tribute to those who live a 
dream because of hard work dur- 
ing classes and in their career

Bonfire night fails to blaze 



One of the more popular 
events of the homecoming week 
on the IPFW campus is the bonfire. 

This was the third year for 
homecoming at IPFW, as well as 
the bonfire which by all accounts 
was the most successful to date. 
However, despite the free food, 
music, and increased participation, 
the event still suffered from poor 
attendance, likely due to adverse

On Tuesday, November 18, a 
medium sized crowd of students 
and faculty gathered in the Walb 
Student Union Ballroom to hear 
Winona LaDuke speak in the third 
lecture of the Omnibus Lecture 
Series, entitled "Politics, 

Motherhood, and Environmental 
Justice from a Native's 
Perspective." 

LaDuke, a subtly powerful 
speaker from northern Minnesota, 
is of the Ojibwe tribe, Bear clan. 
She has run twice for the U.S. vice 
presidency with 

Ralph Nader, backed 
by the Green Party. 

LaDuke spoke on 
a number of subjects, 
including American 
Indian land reserva- 







U...J Mum .,, LaDuke 

a jumping off 

point to address other injustices 
perpetrated by 
the United 

States, such as 
the lack of action 
to help solve, or 



mental justice, and 
energy policies. She 
opened with a brief history lesson 
after discovering that very few 
people in the audience could name 
even ten Native American tribes. In 
actuality, there are 700 different 
Native American communities, 550 
of which are federally recognized. 

The lack of historical educa- 
tion of the Native American peo- 
ples in public schools is, according 
to LaDuke, an attempt at "making 
the native people disappear," thus 
erasing the crimes of the past. 

"This is not about guilt," s.ijd 
LaDuke; rather, it is about learning 
and embracing history - and each 
other - and moving forward into 
the future. 

Speaking from the American 
Indian point of view, LaDuke pre- 
sented the give-and-take policies of 



"A working democ- 
racy requires an 
active citizenry. It is 
not a spectator 
sport,"

towards, 



poverty rate and 
the increasing income difference in 
America between the rich and the 

The main thrust of the speech 
focused closely with environmen- 
tal justice, not only to American 
Indians but to the general 
American public and the rest of the 
world. LaDuke called for energy 
reforms, including scaling back 
nuclear waste production and pro- 
moting the use of wind power and 
other renewable resources, She 
commented on the billions of dol- 
lars still owed to the U.S. govern- 
ment by the Exxon Corporation for 
the massively destructive 1989 
Valdez oil spill in Prince William

IPFW professor 
testing vitamin B6 
for NASA project 



The fourth floor of the IPFW 
Science Building is home to a very 
interesting and possibly life chang- 
ing study of the affects of vitamin 
B6, a water-soluble vitamin that is 
essential for good health. 

Headed by Stephen P. 
Colburn, Chemistry Professor, the 
lab has been at IPFW since last 
summer. At that time, Colburn 
moved the lab from the Fort Wayne 
Developmental Center, where he 
operated his vitamin B6 studies 
since the 1960s before retiring. 

NASA has sent Colburn more 
than a dozen samples to establish 
whether there is a connection 
between the loss of calcium metab- 
olism in astronauts and a loss of 
vitamin B6. NASA's goal, Colbum 
says, is to learn more about nutri- 
tion in space, ff they were to 
become more educated on the mat- 
ter, then the information could be 
critical in sending astronauts to

accomplished. 

In addition to the vitamin B6 
tests, other tests on nutritional 
needs for prolonged space flight 
are being done including bed rest 
studies on bone loss and muscle 
atrophy. 

Colburn is not studying vita- 
min B6 for space benefits alone, 
however. 

Besides the NASA projects, he 
is also involved in collaborations 
on B6 metabolism in post- 
menopausal women, heart trans- 
planted and B6, and its effect on 
skin metabolism. Studies with 
Shriners hospital in St Louis on a 
hereditary bone disorder called 
hypophosphatasia have suggested 
a possible treatment. This test is 
currently being evaluated. 

Despite no clinical proof of a 
significant benefit, many have

Sound and the proposed plans to

nuclear waste, say-

a fan of President 
George W. Bush, 
LaDuke described 
Bush's energy pull- 
ey as "combusting ourselves to the 
edge of oblivion." Instead of taking 
oil from protected lands in Alaska, 
she suggests "democratizing ener- 
gy", producing it locally and con- 
serving energy whenever possible. 

Again she referenced wind 
power, quoting statistics including 
the high rate of jobs available in 
wind power equipment produc- 
tion, which would provide 60 
times more jobs than the current 
fossil fuel industry. 

LaDuke, who professed to not 
being a fan of electoral politics, 
claimed she became a public citi- 
zen for the sake of her children and 
her culture. 

"A working democracy 
requires an active citizenry. It is not 
a spectator sport," commented the 
two-time vice presidential candi- 
date. 

She said the same morals she 
taught to her five children - don't 
steal, don't be greedy, among oth- 
ers - were those that should be 
applied to American politics. 

LaDuke pointed out the vast 
gap between the rich and poor in

Currently LaDuke spends a 

great deal of her time working with 
the White Earth Land Recovery 
Program, whose official purpose is 
"to facilitate recovery of the origi- 
nal land base of the White Earth 
Indian Reservation, while preserv- 
ing and restoring traditional prac- 
tices of sound land stewardship, 
language fluency, community 
development, and strengthening 
our spiritual and cultural heritage." 

WELRP purchases land using 
a "willing seller, willing buyer" pol- 
icy with the interU of returning it to 
the White Earth Indian reservation, 

LaDuke also works with 
Native Harvest, one of the coun- 
try's largest producers of wild rice. 
Native Harvest is run by the 
Anishinaabeg tribe in the 
Northwest Territories, harvesting 
wild rice from native-held lakes.

claimed vitamin B6 to be the won- r

carpal tunnel syndrome to pre-

heart disease. Colbum warns that 
"B6 is not a magic bean," and that 
even though there is no real evi- 
dence that B6 is a problem, exces- 
sive amounts of B6 can be too 
much of a good thing. 

Colburn also says that it is a 
well-known fact that vitamin B6 is 
toxic and excessively high levels 
exposed to the body can be dan-

According to a fact sheet on 
vitamin Bn issued by The National 
Institutes of Health Office of 
Dietary Supplements, a "deficiency 
can occur in individuals with poor 
quality diets that are deficient in 
many nutrients. Symptoms occur 
during later stages of deficiency, 
when intake has been very low for 
an extended time. Signs of vitamin 
Flo deficiency include skin inflam- 
mation, a sore tongue, depression, 
confusion, and convulsions." 

Low amounts of vitamin B6 
are usually found in asthmatic chil- 
dren, older men or women, and 
those suffering from alcohol abuse. 
Colburn says that according to his 
ongoing te-ts, it appears that little 
B6 is required to keep a person 
healthy. 

However, he says it will take a 
few more years of tests to deter- 
mine the optimal long-term intake.

Godhead's 'Evolver' an evolution 



Known as the first band to sign on 
to Marilyn Manson's record label 
Posthuman Records, Godhead, who 
has played on the Ozzfest tour and is 
currently touring with Evanescence, 
will be playing at the Memorial 
Coliseum in the near future With the 
release of their fifth studio album, 
"Evolver", in July, Godhead has 
evolved from industrial-goth to indus- 
trial heavy metal without missing a 

"Evolver" is an album with dark 
lyrics about lost love supported by 
heavy guitar riffs and gloomy industri- 
al programming effects. Tom Z's 
strong drumming moves each song 
along quickly; the album is surprising- 
ly under an hour. Lead singer, Jason C. 
Miller, has a smooth voice that invites 
you into his pain but is sometimes hid- 
den by the loud guitars. 

There are four songs on "Evolver" 
that feature the acoustic guitar, includ- 
ing the full acoustic song "Without." 
The song "Far Too Long" has a pop rock 
feel to it with a beautiful floating piano 
melody, and the heavy metal song "The 
Hate in Me" has a catchy chorus not heard too 
much in heavy metal.

A day to play: 24-hour Playhouse strikes again 



What can happen in 24 hours? Quite a 
bit, if the efforts of the 24-hour playhouse are 
any indication. 

Time is the most pressing issue for all 
involved. Playwrights, actors and directors 
met for the tenth production in the Studio 
theatre in Kettler Hail at 7:45 Friday evening. 
At this time photos are taken of the partici- 
pants; the companies are then decided ran- 
domly by drawing a photo from the pile of 
photos. The participants are a mix of regular 



participants and new; while many students 
are involved with the production, according 
to Jennifer Parker (also a member of the 
IPFW English department) there is a great 
deal of community involvement as well. 

After the participants have been divid- 
ed into companies and an initial meeting 
takes place, the playwright has until the fol- 
lowing morning — tor the November 29 pro- 
duction, until 7 a.m. — to produce their 
script. The writer must take into account not 
only a working idea but also a theme that 
uses the props and costumes brought by the 



writers, the playyvrights meet their produ 
ers and directors at Kinko's, a copy store, t 
create copies of the script tor .ill of the actor 
The majority of the admission price goes 
towards the co-it of copying scripts, accord- 
ing to executive producer Orene Colcord.

Professor organizes cultural 
exchange with Burlington VA 



'Cultural education" was the focus of 
the Three Rivers Jenb6 Ensemble on a recent 
trip to Burlington, Vermont on the weekend 
of November 14. Members of the dance col- 
lective along with IPFW professor Mary 
Ann Cain spent two days in Vermont work- 
ing with students and faculty from the 
University of Vermont's U.S. Literacy 
Politics group and English department and 
children from the King Street Youth Center 
Burlington. 

According to Professor Cain, the Jenbe 1 
ensemble is "not just entertaining, but bring- 
ing people into a sense of community." Cain 
coordinated the cultural exchange with a 
colloague from the University of Vermont. 
The workshops led by the Jenbe ensemble 
included not only dancing, but also drum- 
ming, creative writing, and a discussion 
panel concerning "community-based social 
justice." 

At the King Street Center, members of 
the ensemble (ages ranging from young chil- 
dren to the elderly) instructed youths in the 
after school and teen futures program. 

According to Cain, who served as a 



documenter of the proceedings, an experi 
ence with the Jenbe' ensemble is "always 
more than what you think." Members of the 
ensemble, she said, worked

"Community groups help us under- 
stand important things about how peoplt 
come to literacy," she commented. Cain fur- 
ther commented that it was a "very power 
ful exchange on all kinds of levels." 

The Jenbe ensemble is part of the Fori

the chance to interact with children ant 
adults from another community who havi 
similar interests," commented Jenbe" ensem

The desire to "see how 
foster cultural exchange" is an important 
goal of Cain. 

"A university has a responsibility 
help foster these kinds of exchanges," ! 
commented. 

Plans for future engagements with the 
ensemble are in the works, according to the 
professor, though nothing is confirmed yet.

Editorial 



There is strength in numbers 

If South Park characters were to see the crowd at the 2003 Pep Rally or 
Homecoming game, they might have a word — or two — to say. 

"Weak, dude." 

Not that it wasn't and isn't a good idea for student organizations to put forward, 
but the idea -for all of it's publicity and on-campus hype - just hasn't quite caught 
on yet. 

Potentially, the rally and game were hurt in attendance by the survival of so 
mam/ local high schools in football playoffs. When one sport is in its final stages, and 
another is just starting, parents and fans rightfully go where more sacrifice has been 
already made during the season. 

But that said, it was a light turnout for Dickie V's Pep Rally, and while the 
crowd urns good in the Allen County Memorial Coliseum, it wasn't a crowd which 
raised the roof or shook the floor. There were some fans who were hyped up, some on 
school spirit, others on alcohol — and their were student participants who truely have 
caught the concept of school spirit. 

Perhaps with our campus makeup, "Homecoming" is different for us. With the 
average age on campus at 25, a homecoming is literally an effort to go see family, and 
classmates or faculty don't quite qualify. 

Not tlial they can't or shouldn't qualify as an extended family. We're bound to 
interact with each other for at least one semester, and for some of us, years and years 
and even more years of college education and work. The concept of celebrating a 
Homecoming seems like it should be enjoyed here like it is at many other schools. 

Perhaps it will be something that does groiv with time, and continued efforts, 
from student leaders and the 1PFW community. 

Letters to the editor 
Homecoming disappointments 

As you may have noticed, the week before Thanksgiving was Homecoming week at 
1PFW. Each day had its own special theme, and the week culminated in a big party with Dick 
Vitale before the big game. However, from everything that I have seen and heard, 
Homecoming (especially the pre-game party) ranged from a modest success to an outright 
disappointment. It is my contention that the university is responsible for the events' lacklus- 
ter results. As evidence for my case, allow me to relate my experiences and observations. 

I am an active student in the Honors Program, and last year members of the program 
decide that we wanted to hold a Homecoming party this year. We received approval and 
money for the event from student government, so we thought there would be no problems. 
When we were deciding when to schedule the event, however, we heard that only universi- 
ty students could go to the Homecoming events -- naturally we decided to investigate. It 
turns out that everyone was welcome at student events -- friends, family and members of the 
community at large - but only students were supposed to eat the food! While no one 
explained the rationale to me, 1 can only guess that it goes like this -- money for food comes 
from the students, so the food should only be eaten by the students. 

First of all, Homecoming is a terrible time to make an issue out of who can eat the food 
at events where everyone may attend. It is THE game where people are encouraged to come, 
and the parties should reflect that by welcoming everyone as equal participants. Secondly, if 
the goal is to save money, there are better ways to go about it -- fewer giveaways during the 
week comes to mind immediately (honestly, doesn't five days of events make the pre-game 
party anti-climactic?) Third, a policy such as this will lose both non-students and students 
because students won't bring children, friends or even spouses to the events if they will be 
treated as second-rate participants and will therefore avoid going just to reduce the hassle. 

I'm sure many readers didn't even realize that non-students weren't supposed to eat 
the food at the pre-game events, and you may not even believe that the policy made a dif-

child so I didn't have any brothers drag me there to see "real football." , 
'on 'I even live in South Bend. However. I have just finished my first yea, 
s an usher during the football season at Notre Dame and I am t 
changed person" for having had this experience. 

About a decade ago, I remember seeing the movie, Rudy. For those of you 
who have not seen the movie, it is the real life story of Rudy Ruettiger, a 
student who beat the odds to get enrolled at Notre Dame. His dream 
to be a member of the Notre Dame football team. After years of helping 
the team, but not actually being a member of the team, he gets to dress 
and actually play in a game. He is the only player ever carried out on I 
shoulders of the football team at games end according to the movie. 

In the movie, Ruettigcr's father, played by Ned Beatty, is totally in a; 

lie entered the Notre Dame Stadium to see his son. I can tell you, a: 
ticket taker at Gate B, people still enter the stadium with amazement 
their eyes. I have seen people genuflect before entering the gate and ev 
tore have their picture taken as they walk through the gate. I question 

lady who works at a souvenir stand outside my gate, "What do they 
actually have in the background except a black gate or bricks?' 
replied, "Tim/ have the Notre Dame ushers behind them. That's how 
thev will --how others where they were." 

I have never thought of myself as a linebacker or quarterback for Notre 

However, I am a vigilant protector of the stadium and ama± 
will ambassador for their "team. " I smile so much as 1 greet people that 
I'm beginning to get lines on my face. 

"Welcome to Notre Dame, " I say to everyone even during the last minute 
rush of patrons getting in for the game. I tear their ticket and make a 
point of making eye tontnet with each person so they feel I'm really con- 
necting with them. When 1 have time I also say other welcoming sayings, 
such as, "It's a privilege to have you with us today. " I always try to say 
that to the opposing team* fan* . Sometime- they reply, "I bet you're priv- 
ileged, we're going to win." TlicH 1 say, "We're Still happy to have you 
&gt;ith us. " 

If they are older Notre Dame fans or -very "decorated" Notre Dame fans, 
I tell them, "I'm glad to see you again. " It is from this remark I hear the 
glory stories of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago. I hear the history of when 
they saw their first Notre Dame game, who the "star players" were that 
i, how old they were then. The "first timers " eagerly tell me this is 
their first game and I assure them it won 7 be their last. 

I went up early this past weekend to attend a "pep rally" at Joyce Center 
Friday night. 1 have never seen so much spirit and dedication. The 
auditorium was filled to the brim with over 3,000 Notre Dame students, 
fans and alumni. There were motivational speeches from the coach, sen- 
players and the pep rally MC's. Tliere was the "pom squad," cheer- 
leaders, dancers, tlie flag wavers, the Leprechaun, the Notre Dame band 
and team. The energy almost blew the roof off the arena. There is a real 
lesson on "true spirit" to be learned in South Bend. 

Notre Dame football is not about tailgate parties or just "Touchdown 
]esus" The history of Notre Dame: past, present and the future in the 
making fills the campus. Their religious beliefs, their determination and 
winning attitudes permeate throughout the wails of the stadium onto 
every block of the campus. Once you are "touched" by Notre Dame, you 

if you can find the time in your busy schedule to get away, go to Notre 
Dame. Witness this mystical place for yourself. Tour their historical 
halls, watch a game, go to the bookstore, go to mass and vieio the "Notre 
Dame spirit" far yourself. I have traveled around the world and have 
found such a "blessed" place to be. 

As the last home game of their 2003 season came to a close, I felt very sad 
it end. I will always remember this season because the "Notre 
Dame spirit" has raised me up on its shoulders and cartied me off their 
field. I told the departing fans, "see you next season." And 1 will! I look 
forward to returning to Gate B in the 2004 season with my Notre Dame 
of 2003. Go Irish.

among us, and the gay-bashers. 
Man shalt not lay with man as if 
man were woman. Now, if you 
don't believe in the Bible, you real- 
ly needn't read further, because 
everything that is going to be dis- 
cussed is all bogus to you. 

Homosexuality is a sin, and 
most avidly religious people will 
not fall back and avoid telling you 
this. They hand out pamphlets 
about how God hates Gays and 
Lesbians, they'll protest openly 
Homosexual events {Corpus 
Christi sound familiar?) and even 
on occasion, express outright dis- 
gust and hatred for Homosexuals 
and their supporters. 

Homosexuality isn't alone in 
the religious spotlight, but it is one 
of the few socially spotlighted sins. 
Abortion is another and Gambling, 
another no-no. These three are 
some of the religious protest focal 

Step back and sit down, typical 
relgion-ite. You will tell me that 
sinners are bad and the cause of the 
world's problems. Is murder a sin? 
Yes, thou shalt not kill says the 
book. The Bible also states that 
your body is the temple of God and 
polluting the temple is a sin. I'm 
not singling out alcohol, because 
drinking is mentioned in the good 
book, in moderation. Most things 
are approved of, in moderation, in

Biggie-size your French fries? 
Gluttony is a sin, and one of the 
seven deadly sings at that. Don't 
eat more than what's necessary, for 
the love of all that's good and holy! 
How many of you were stuffed to 
the brim on Thanksgiving Day? Be 
careful about what you eat. I doubt 
filling your church with drugs and 
chemicals would go over well with 
the congregation, so why would 
you fill your body with them? The 
Bible states the nothing should 
come before God, but it's funny 
how many Church goers are seen 
with coffee cups before and after 
sermons, not only is caffeine a 
drug, but a powerfully addictive 
one at that. Addictions are a sin, 
you know. Quick! Someone organ- 
ize a protest against 
Starbucks... those sinners need to 
leam the ways of the Lord! 

Examining addictions, I think 
everyone can relate, "but, I've never 
done drugs in my entire life!" 
Ahhh, my narrow-minded friend, 
illegal drugs alone do not an addic- 
tion make, although they are the 
most talked about. Drugs, alcohol, 
tobacco, caffeine, chocolate, televi- 
sion, junk-food, Internet, music, 
sugar, video games and sex are 
some other fun, but still very con- 



trolling and -infill addictions. 

I hate traffic and I hate stupid 
drivers as much, if not more, than 
the traffic jams they create. More 
than once, after witnessing some 
superb display of consideration, 
coordination and intelligence, I've 
let a few choice words slide. These 
are impure thoughts, no matter 
whether you intend to say them (or 
do them) or not, they are still 
wrong. Many say it the best when 
they preach "if you think it, you've 

Who hasn't watched that guy or 
girl on campus and not thought 
about what'd they do with a chance 
to be alone with them. Lust. Yup, 
you've caught on, I'm impressed! 
Lust is another sin, 

Now I know the avid Bible- 
thumpers among us are pulling out 
the forgiveness card. I'm saying 
this because I've heard it a million 
times before. "I'm saved and have 
been forgiven." Yeah, if you truly 
committed yourself, at the moment 
of acceptance and commitment, I'm 
willing lo say, from the Bible's per- 
spective, you're OK. If you've com- 
pletely shed your "old self," 
become a new person, and given 
up every ungodly thing about you, 
I'd love to meet you, you can 
preach to me any day. But until 
you've given up every sin your life, 
don't attempt to stand on your 
soapbu* when it comes to pointing 
out the damnation of others. 

Ask forgiveness if you've done 
wrong. Repent, and be saved! Part 



of that is saying "hey God, 1 know 
this is wrong, I'm sinning, please 
forgive me" and then not going it 
again! This isn't an excuse to go 
out, do whatever you feel like 
doing, and then say "oooops, I've 
been naughty". If you insist on 
doing that, don't preach to others 
that they're going to suffer eternal- 
ly That's hypocritical, to say the 
least. The Bible doesn't distinguish 
or grade one sin from another. A 
sin is a sin is a sin, lying to your 
parents is equally bad in the eyes of 
God as murder. This means I he caf- 
feine-addicted churchgoer is as 
much as a sinner as they claim the 
homosexual to be. Hypocrisy is 
also discouraged in the Bible as 
they people are told not to ignore 
the plank in their eyes as they point 
out the splinter in the eyes of their 
neighbors. They are reminded that 
those who live in glass houses 
should not throw stones. 

We are instructed to love the 
sinner, hate the sin, not to hat the 
sin and despise, harass and insult 
the sinner. I am a sinner, I admit 
this fully. 1 am addicted to sugar, 
caffeine, French fries, making out, 
and the Inlemet. I've had impure 
thoughts and have lied to people 
around me. I have openly gay 
friends, and I still love them to 
pieces even though 1 know that the 
Bible says we're all wrong. 1 love 
my friends, homosexuals and het- 
erosexuals, smokers and non- 
smokers, fat and thin, black and

We are adults, we're going to do 
what we want to do. Since this 
seems to be the topic du jour, I'll 
illustrate my final point as such: 

Homosexual among us that is 
unaware of the Bible's stand on 
their lifestyle, you can tell them 
you don't agree with it, but thev are 
so much more than who they date. 
(I'm sure there are some nt you that 
wouldn't want to be judged on 
who you've dated in the past.) 
They may not agree with the fact 
that you smoke, or that you lie to 
your loved ones, but thev BIB OK 
with looking past our "sins" to see 
us as a whole, Maybe some of you 
shouters of the gospel should take 
a lesson from our gay friends. Why 
can't the masses of so called "reli- 
gious and loving people" look 
through the glasses of hypocrisy to 
see that they aren't the perfect 
angels they would believe them-

College is one of those 
experiences that sucks the life out .

with is a bruise of the experience 
and a Dixie Cup filled with orange

the never-ending bruise to your 
pride that you now know nothing. 
They give you a piece of paper, 
which will probably be one of the 
most expensive pieces of paper you 
will ever own next to your death 
certificate. The orange juice in this 
situation is that you are now filled 
with enough information to go

ways it has, and in other ways I 
think college has given me the abil- 
ity to survive by knowing how to 
play the "game". I learned to play 
the game through many hard 
knocks and horrid lessons, taught 
to me by professors who thought 
they were God. I always thought 
college was a place to be educated 
on a higher level, not necessarily 
learn how lo play mind games with 
people who have a "golden sheep- 
skin" tacked to their wall. Do I hold 
a vice against these people? No. It 
just made me stronger. It gave me 
the ability to see what kind of per- 
son I am, and am becoming. 

College is really not meant 
for everyone, but like many things 
in life, it's worth a try.

ference. As proof, I will cite the Honors Program. We at the Honors Program 
feel that events like Homecoming should not just be about student pride in 
IPFW, but should include faculty, staff, alumni, families, friends and the com- 
munity as a whole. We specifically advertised our event as a forum for these 
people to come and celebrate and support EPFW (to my knowledge, we were 
the only ones who provided such a forum). Many of our attendees brought 
children and family along and mentioned that they were glad that they did- 
n't have to tell their kids that they could not eat when food was all around 
them. 

We had over 30 attendees at our event — which does not seem like a 
lot, but it was our first ever Homecoming event. As the clinching evidence of 
our success, we had a representative from the "official" pre-game party come 
by and suggest that we leave our party and attend theirs, because they did 
not have any students and it was embarrassing for them. I certainly can sym- 
pathize with organizers who suffer from poor attendance, but it is difficult to 
feel sorry for IPFW in this case.

Pagans the same as all... 

In truth, Pagans are the same as everyone else. We have the right to 
believe what we like as entitled by the Constitution of The United States of 
America. We are everywhere. We sit next to you at the movies, in restaurants 
and in classes. We provide services you use every day. We come from all 
walks of life and are not always obvious to point out. We are not here to con- 
vert. We are here to leam lessons in life like everyone else and to live our lives 
to the best of our abilities. 



We are in all walks of life. We serve you dinner when you decide you 
don't want to cook. We protect you as police officers, firemen and para- 
medics. We are the doctors that help nurse you back to health. We are the sol- 
diers on the front line defending your freedoms. We are the teachers educat- 
ing the youth of tomorrow. We are the parents of your children's friends and 
members of the PTA. We are members of the local Chamber of Commerce. We 
are the people you see on the television and hear on the radio. We grow your 
food, we make your clothes and we even sign your paychecks. 

We believe in a spirituality that takes years not days to attain, a simple 
book out of the New Age section does not have all the answers we require. In 
addition, most of us do not have teachers to lead us to the divine and have to 
search for the truths on our own. Therefore it is not uncommon for us to be 
students of many faiths seeking a path to spiritual enlightenment. 

We are active in the community. We hold prayer services when there is 
a tragedy within the community or the nation. On September 11, 2001, the 
Pagan Student Alliance in conjunction with Intervarsity Christian Fellowship 
held a candle light vigil for all the victims in New York, Washington, D.C., 
and Pennsylvania. We held a vigil of remembrance on the one-year anniver- 
sary of this tragedy. We joined with other organizations to hold a blood drive. 
We have joined with other local Pagan organizations (i.e. Fort Wayne Pagan 
Alliance) in various ventures such as Pagan Pride Day, a food drive for 
Community Harvest Food Bank and other various charities. We believe it is 
only right to fairly take and fairly give. 

Now that you know more about us and what we do in the communi- 
ty you are welcome to meet with us, the Pagan Student Alliance. We pass this 
invitation to people of all religious beliefs. Meetings begin at 7:30 every 
Wednesday night at the Walb Student Union Building. Please stop in to see 
the real truth for yourself.

First Person 



Simply: I am an atheist 



When I was 7-years-old, I 
turned to my mother and said, 
"You know. Christianity is just like 
Greek Mythology: it's just people 
trying to explain where they came 
from." I suppose this was the 
moment that, somewhere in the 
back of my mind, a seed of doubt 
towards my Presbyterian upbring- 
ing was bom. Eventually, I would 
come to abandon religion all 
together, becoming what many 
view as evil, anti- American, or sim- 
ply misguided. I am an atheist. 

I have found that, among many 
crowds, that simple sentence - 1 am 
an atheist - generates much the 
same response as "I'm a Wiccan" or 
"I'm a Satanist." All three of these 
schools of thought are largely mis- 
understood by the public at large, 
and often labeled as amoral, anti- 
American, and downright evil. 
Frequently I am asked the ques- 
tion, "If you don't believe in God, 
what reason do you have to be 

Atheism is considered to be an 
excuse for someone to disregard 
the rules of society and do whatev- 
er pleases them best, regardless of 
the consequences. In reality, athe- 
ism is, according to Webster, "a dis- 
belief in the existence of a deity." 
Simply put, I do not believe there 
is, was, or ever will be, a god or 



t think, or care to think, about 
religious things, and simply neg- 
lects to have a belief one way or 
another. Some assert that this is not 
atheism at all, but a form of agnos- 
ticism. Active atheism, my brand of 
atheism, is when the individual has 
chosen specifically not to believe in 
any "god or gods, for whatever per- 
sonal reasons. The process of 
becoming an active atheist does not 
go quickly, or smoothly: for me, it 
was fraught with emotional strain, 
trying to cope with the fact that 
deep down inside, I could not fea- 
sibly accept the presence of a high- 
er power, an afterlife, of Fate or 
Providence or Serendipity. For 
many years I was agnostic, hoping 
that there was something larger 
out there who would comfort and 
care for me, seeking out a religion 
that wasn't riddled with 
hypocrisies and magical explana- 
tions of how we came to be. Sadly, 
I was unable to find any religion I 
felt was right with me and the facts 
I know are true about the world: 
the earth is 4.5 billion years old, the 
dinosaurs did exist, and we did 
evolve from an ape-like creature. I 
came to the conclusion that no one 
religion was any more right than 
the other. They were all, quite sim-

Toledo spoils Homecoming party 



By Nick West 
The Communicator 

IPFVV's homecoming sea- 
son opener did not turn out the 
way most would have liked. 

The Toledo Rockets 
crashed the p.irty by defeating thi? 
Mastodons 71-53 in front of a 
Memorial Coliseum crowd of 
3,644. 

IPFW had a dismal shoot- 
ing performance, making just 35 
percent from the Held and four of 
2d three-pointers. 

"We had all the tools. We 
got everything done in the summer 
and prepared in practice. We just 
didn't come out and get it done 
tonight," said Junior center David 
Simon. 

Simon, who was the lone 
Mastodon in double scoring fig- 
ures with 17, faced double and 
triple team defenses the entire 
game. When pressured by the 
extra defenders, he passed to the 



perimeter, where the Mastodons 
shot a grisly 15 percent from the 
three-point line. 

"I think we have some 
good shooters," said IPFW head 
coach Doug Noll. "We just could- 
n't knock them down tonight." 

The Mastodons, who 
trailed by 12 points at halftime, 
were never able to build momen- 
tum after a big play. In a six sec- 
ond span, guard Terry Collins stole 
the ball, turned it over, and then 
drew a personal foul which subse- 
quently led to three consecutive 
Rocket baskets. At the 8:31 mark, 
Kyle Thrasher hit a three-pointer, 
but just 28 seconds later Ingram 
buried one of his own, giving the 
Rockets a 16-point lead. 

"We were never able to 
build any momentum on the 
defensive end. They really did a 
nice job of taking things away from 
us, but we kind of played into their

Despite Simon being the 



only double-digit scorer, Noll 
believes several players have the 
ability to significantly contribute. 

"We know who our scorers 
are," he said. "We have four scorers 
back that had doubles figures last 
year. We're not starting Terry 
(Collins) now, but we know we can 
score. We got to have that balance. 
When you knock shots down, it 
opens it up for Dave. If you don't 
knock them down, you see what 
happens tonight." 

Simon and sophomore 
guard Quintin Carouthers were 
pleased with the Homecoming 
crowd turnout.

Carouthers agreed, "It was

IPFW is 
Valpariso 

Loli-uum 



Vitale inspires, entertains 



By Nick West 
The Communicator 

Dick Vitale lines young peo- 
ple. He loves college students and the 
college atmosphere. He loves colle- 
giate athletics, especially basketball. 
And seriously, he loves IPFW. 

"You have a beautiful school 
here," he told me while signing a fan's 

Sports editorial ' h e 



The building up of the dorms is great, 
man. Academically, it's a great place; 
you get a degree with Indiana and 
Purdue on it, man." 

On November 21, "Dickie V," 
as he is better known as, was on 
IPFW's campus for the university's 
homecoming events. He signed 
copies of his book "Living a Dream" at 
the Gates Center, made a speech at the 



pep rally, pumped up the Memorial 
Coliseum crowd before the IPFW- 
Toledo basketball game, and finished 
the day by dancing with cheerleaders 
and students in the Tar Pit student sec- 

"I'm 64 and I act about 12," he 
said. "Its because 1 am around young 
people. " Thereafter, he posed for a pic- 
ture with an IPFW student, shook his 
hand, said, "Hey, you're welcome, 
man," in response to the student's 
gratitude, and then moved onto the 
next person. 

But it was during the pep rally 
that Vitale showed another side of 
himself, probably unknown to the 
crowd. For the most part, he wasn't 
the crazy, excitement-filled ESPN 
broadcaster that we have known for 
several years. He was an inspiration,
