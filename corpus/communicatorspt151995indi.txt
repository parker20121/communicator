J Merman Blake, vice-chancellor for 
undergraduate education at lUPUI and 
adviser to the president of ILI, will speak 
to the campus and moderate a student 
panel discussion dealmg with "Diversity 
at IPFW: 
Building a 
Community" 
today and 
tomorrow. 
The two day 
sessions will 
allow students 
and the public 
to examine 
issues of 
diversity on the campus as well as open 
a door of communication between stu- 
dents and the administration. 

Students were invited to a pizza lunch 
today in Walb Union 224. A student dis- 
cussion was conducted during the lunch 
by Jeanne Tessier Barone. instructor of 
communica- 
tion. Pizza was 
provided for 
nearly sixty stu- 
dents by the 
chancellor The 
session was 
informal and 
addressed the 
communication 
barriers of dif- 
ferent socioeconomical backgrounds. 




Later in the 
afternoon . 
Blake will pre- 
sent ihc 
keynote 
address: 
"Building 
Community: 

Bringing 'v y 

Diversity ^"-—.-^ 

issues from Margin to Center," at 2 p.m. 
in Walb Union Ballroom. 

Then from 3 pm. lo 4;15 p.m., the 
audience will be divided into small 
groups which 
will focus on 
the ideas pre- 
sented in the 
address. 
According lo 
Frank Borelli, 
vice chancel- 
lor of student 
affairs, one 
person in 
each focus group will be asked to record 
their groups feelings and suggestions, 
and then present them to the entire audi- 
ence. 

Borelli said the suggestions will be 
considered by the adminisUation, but 
said the administration cannot make any 
adjusmients in diversity poUcies or pro- 
cedures until it has heard from the 
groups. 

He did report however, the sugges- 
tions made by the participants will prob- 
ably help set the tone for the diversity 




council's actions the rest of the year. 

Chris Douse, of the diversity council, 
JPSGA chief of staff, and student pan- 
elist, said the diversity council has 
already met and is examining other 
information in order to set goals for the 
year. 

Friday, in Walb Union 224 at 9 a.m., 
seven students will serve as a panel to 
discuss "The Challenges of Diversity in 
the University." The panel is expected to 
suggest ideas to help the campus better 
develop the 
climate of the 
university and 
help create as 
sense of unity. 
"It's going to 
point out the 
issues of stu- 
dents, not just 
African 
Americans 
and Hispanics, but how all students are 
treated." said Douse. 

According to Douse a campus cli- 
mate survey was completed several 
years ago by 
former direc- 
tor of 
Multicultural 
Services Betty 
Poignard and 
William 
Ludwin, assis- 
tant dean and 
director of the 
school of pub- 





lic and envi- 
ronmental 
affairs, but no 
follow-up was 
completed by 
university 
administra- 
tion. 

"We have to 
hold them 
responsible," 
Douse said. 
"If we don't hold them responsible, Ihey 
don't have to do anything." 

Douse said he believes the sugges- 
tions made by students will reflect many 
of the climate issues previously discov- 
ered in Poignard and Ludwin's survey, 
and believes students will demand more 
professors of color, 

"Just because we have an African 
American and Hispanic secretary in a 
Keltler administrative office docs not 
mean we have diversity," said Douse, "if 
we want 




Students write, produce comedy 



by Jennifer Zartman 
Chief Reporter 

Lights! Camera! Tent 
Meeting! What?! 

September 21, 22 and 23, 
PIT performs 'Tent Meeting" 
in the Studio Theater. Tickets 
are priced at S5 for adults, $4 
for senior citizens, IPFW fac- 
ulty, staff and non-IPFW stu- 
dents and $3 for IPFW stu- 
dents with ID. cards. 

The production, directed 
by IPFW graduate Amy 
Paliganoff, will cast David J. 
Moore. Heath Hays, Amy 
Marie Ball, Ryan B. Berkes 
and Ted Brown in a laughter- 
filled comedy with a lot of 
overtones about the 
hypocrisy of rehgion. 

"Tent Meeting," by 
Rebecca Wackier. Larry 
Larson and Levi Lee, is an 
examination of a flamboyant 
revivalist preacher and his 
bizarre children. 

The Reverend Ed Tarbox 
(David J. Moore) is busy 
thumping die Bible, while his 



son. Darrell (Headi Hays), a 
W,W,n veteran attempts lo 
make himself a hero by 
claiming that a scar from his 
hernia operation is really a 
Nazi bayonet wound. Becky 
(Amy-Marie Ball), the rev- 
erend's daughter, stuffs cot- 
ton in her ears to muffle the 
constant drone of celestial 
music which plays in her 
head. Her infant son, Jesus O, 
Tarbox, who survives despite 
having been bom without a 
mouth, eyes, nose or - even 
more interestingly - vital 
organs! 

The plot surrounds the 
voyage of the Soudiem-bom 
eccentricities to the promised 
land to present baby Jesus 0. 
Tarbox as the new Messiah, 

"The play is going great." 
Paliganoff said, "and we have 
a fantastic cast," 

"The budget is lower for 
diis presentauon." Paliganoff 
added, "This isn't something 
you'd see on the main stage." 
she said, "but it is all done by 
students." 



"We are really looking 
forward to having a sold-out 
stage for all three nights of 
the performance," Paliganoff 
said. 

This is not Paliganoff's 
first shot at directing a play. 
In fact Paliganoff has direct- 
ed several plays at IPFW and 
other places as well. 

"This has really been a 
great experience." Pahganoff 
said. "It's been nice working 
with the cast and the variety 
of resources." 

Tickets for the show went 
on sale Monday and can be 
purchased through the 
Williams Theater box office, 
Monday through Saturday, 
1:30-5:30 p.m.. or at the 
Studio Theater box. begin- 
ning one hour before curtain 
on the night of the perfor- 
mance.

State, county tackle welfare reform 



by Jennifer Zartman 
Chief Reporler 

The government has finally dealt a 
long-awaited hard hand to the problems 
of the welfare system. The Clinton 
administration approved Indiana's pro- 
gram last December - with some of the 
most extensive welfare waivers granted 
to a state, 

"The president gave permission to 
begin a dramatic move for those on wel- 
fare, off. and into employment." said 
Governor Evan Bayh, 

"I believe in giving assistance to those 
in need." Bayh said, "but it is time for 



them to hold up their end of the deal." 

Bayh said it is time to raise the stan- 
dard of living for those in the state of 
Indiana.He feels Qiis is possible through 
the new approach to welfare and through 
forcing people off welfare and into Uie 
work force 

"In order to raise the standard of liv- 
ing, we need to tighten our bell and cut 
spending when we have to," Bayh said. 

"Welfare was always intended to be 
temporary," Bayh said, "and it is not 
good for children to be ni homes where 
there is no income" 

In a press conference on Monday. 
Bayh addrt:ssed the issue of welfare with 



stalistics and facts. 

To those on welfare, Bayh said. "We 
will give you a helping hand to get 
through a difficuh period and we're will- 
ing to help the kids, but if you are an 
able-bodied adult, when we find a job for 
you, you either go back to work or we no 
longer pay you welfare," Bayh said. 

"It's as it should be, 1 think it's fair lo 
the taxpayer, and it's better for the kids 
in the long nm to have parent in a house- 
hold that has a job." Bayh added. 

Bayh said that if a parent refuses to 
work their personal benefits will be cut. 
but the children's benefits will not 

"We have tried to take the approach 



with a firm stand for parents, but we stilt 
provide for the kids," Bayh said. 

About S3 milUon ui savings has been 
realized, even though there have been 
cost increases in Job placement and child 
care during the conversion between liv- 
ing on welfare and returning lo work. 

"In June, after welfare recipients 
began signing personal responsibility 
agreements, we began to sec a dramatic 
decrease in die number of individuals on 
welfare." Bayh said. 

The personal responsibility agree- 
ments are a written promise stating thai

The Black Collegian Caucus 
(BCC) Is a sludenl organization 
consisting priinajily of African- 
American students It provides 
African-American and olhcr siu- 
denis with a chance to grow and 
leam from one another 

Seeking to provide a suppttft ser- 
vice for African -American students 
if. (he chief roll of the BCC, howev- 
er: the organisation is well accom- 
plished in other areas as well. 
Students are encouraged to 
exchange experiences and learn 
from one another It provides stu- 
dents of any race with an excellent 
way to support Ihe community 
through various service projects. It 
also allows people to develop valu- 
able leadership skills which are a 
necessity m the professional world 

Each year the organization 
selects new officers to lead the 



group. It is the officers' jobs to 
make sure the upcoming year is 
productive and successful. This 
year the president is Melacyn 
Truner-Williams Eleanor Jones is 
holding the office of vice-president 
The ofrices of secretary and trea- 
surer are yet to be filled 

Limited to only the IPFW cam- 
pus, the BCC is relatively small in 
numbers. This pcrmiLs the group to 
become more like a close family. 
Memb 

The BCC welcomes anyone 
interested to participate in the sev- 
eral events and meetings which is 
why the actual number of members 
rarely reflects the number of people 
in attendance 

Non -African -Americans are also 
invited to join the BCC, Learning 
about another culture, especially 
one as large as the African- 
Amencan, is an important expen- 
encc which many people overlook. 
The events the BCC sponsors bene- 



fit the entire campus as well as the 
African- American students 

The BCC and other groups arc 
extremely important on a commuter 
campus suth as IPFW. according 
the groups adviser Tim Lake 

It provides a place different 
groups of students can identify 
with. "It's like a calling canl. It's a 
place for African-American stu- 
dents 10 gather and socialize," 
said Lake. 

One of the primary jobs of the 
BCC is to visit various middle and 
high schools in the area. While 
there they encourage students of 
color to attend college, and particu- 
larly IPFW, 

They show them that there is 
support there for people such as 
themselves They explain the 
imponance of a college degree in 
today's competitive job market. By 
doing this the group is investing in 
the future.

Hispanos Unidos, a student 
organization which supports the 
recognition of the Hispanic culture 
on campus began as Students for 
Hispanic Cultural Exchange in 
19S7 by informal meetings In 
1988 it became recognized by the 
university. Although the organiza- 
tion adopted its current name in 
1989. the organization still is pri- 
marily around to increase knowl- 
edge of the Hispanic culture. 

Both social a.spects and support 
are provided by the Hispanos 
Unidos for non-Hispanic as well as 
Hispanic students. It provides a 
forum for Hispanic issues on cam- 
pus and helps students interested in 
the Hispanic culture to leam more 
about It and its language. 

These IPFW students also are 
part of a local and regional network 



which promotes awareness of the 
Hispanic culture. 

Many members of the Hispanos 
Unidos are not of a Hispanic back- 
ground. Last year the group h.id 43 
members Of those members, 13 
were not Hispanic. 

Non-Hispanic members may 
simply be interested in the culture 
or, often limes, as students of 
Spanish classes join the Hispanos 
Unidos so they may learn more 
about the language and the culture. 

The officers are in charge of 
organizing the group and setting 
short and long term goals The 
President is Andre Fux. Fux is 
assisted by Vice President Pete 
Fussle. Treasurer Sergio Amador, 
and Secretary Sarah Klaehn. 

Members of the Hispanos 
Unidos are able to participate in 
cultural activities and as well as 
raise awareness of other cultures in 
the community. 

"It creates an environment 



where students feel they can partic- 
ipate." said Paulina Salvador, the 
organization's advisor. 

The Hispanos Unidos is an 
active organization. They hear pre- 
sentations from speakers, both from 
IPFW and the community. 

The group is active in Big 
Brothers/Big Sisters. One of their 
largest projects is touring area mid- 
dle and high schools to support 
Hispanic students who are interest- 
ed in college and educate those stu- 
dents who are not Hispanic about 
die culture. 

New members arc always wel-

Walb operations continues Sweet Shoppe services 



Governor Bayh delivers a speech on Monday, 



by Melissa Ynung-Flores 
News Editor 

Last spring the Sweet Shoppe 

located in Walb was closed to make 
way for in^roved Walb Union opera- 
tions, according to Walt Branson, 
vice-chancellor of financial affairs, 
and Philip Groie. comptroller. 

The Sweet Shoppe not only 
offered students a chance to end a 
chocolate craving, but also made 
check cashing, faxing, and PIT, 
Philharmonic, and Regal Cinema uck- 
et purchasing available. Since the 
closing of ibe Shoppe, renovauons are 
underway to use the space as pan of a 
larger and more visible union opera- 
tions. 

"By putting union operations in 



there, it will expand Ihe hours, and 
better bcnefii smdenis and visiters of 
the union," said Branson. 

Grole said all of the services previ- 
ously offered in the Sweet Shoppe 
with the exception of check cashing 
have been available since the summer 
in the current union opera uons. 

The new union operations is not 
expected to be up and running until 



October, however. Groie said check 
cashing will he made available to siu- 
denis soon if there is a demand. 

Branson said he plans to speak 
with IPSGA President Kevin Eads 
about check cashing and they will 
find a way to offer the service some- 
where else in the building until the 
renovations have been completed. 

Until earlier this week, Eads said 



he did not even know the check cash- 
ing service would ever be available 
again. 

"We have had a lot of complaints. 
The service is innporiant to students 
who have their main classes in CM, 
Fine Arts, and the sports center." Eads 
said, "If It IS possible I hope to have it 
in place ASAP." 



- Welfare continued from page 1 
the parents will seek employment. 
immunize their children and forgo 
cash increases for additional chil- 
dren bom 10 months after the fami- 
ly begins Aid to Families with 
Dependent ChildR'n 

Those signing the agreement 
may lose benefits if they quit a job 
without good reason. They are also 
permanently banned from the pro- 
gram if they commit welfare fraud. 

According to the administration. 
the number of families on welfare 
has dropped from 65,474 to 56,700 
since January 1995 And, as of 
June, there were 21.789 penalties 
assessed on recipients, compared 
with 2,732 the previous year, 

"We haven't seen a lot of change 
in our offices," said a Fort Wayne 
Housing Authority representative. 

The Housing Authority com- 
mented on two women who quit 
their jobs and asked to have 
changes made in their rent situation. 

Both women were sent to the 
welfare office and were refused 
because they bad quit their jobs 
without proper cause 

The next week, they had jobs," 
the representative said "So, the 
new proposals must be working - 



and it's great seeing people working 

and not needing assistance," 

And. it appears that more 
changes are in the works. 

The General Assembly, along 
with the administration, has passed 
more changes for welfare this past 
session, including a two-year life- 
tune cap on benefits, with up to one 
year of transitional benefits in some 
cases Several other benefits still 
wait federal approval 



"If we aiE looking at 50 percent 
reduction and we have achieved 13 
percent in eight months," Bayh 
said, "I think we are well on our 
way to reaching our goals,"

is in the ratings of independent analysts.

Indiana's members of

control an aspect of our lives 

which doesn't need their help. 

Eighieen hours is a time frame that

each woman has

These clinics are not opened

According to Ihe Fort Wayne

prior to the procedure This local 
clinic also tells us that no abortions 
are performed immedialcly, that 
women must be scheduled and 
coun'^lcd before it happens. 



eighteen hours is not only unneces- 
sary, but it is inconvenient. 

No matter what your personal

Commentan 



Satire 



Beckley gets his wish 



hyJeffDrunsim 
Columnist 

lliis \vriier was surprised that no 
one at IPFW rebutted the views 
espoused by The Communicator's 
editor-in-chief, Nol Beckley. in his 
August 24 commentary headlined 
"Bum Faulkner at Ihe stake," 1 rec- 
ognize why some might ignore it, 
however; I've heard it suggested 
that acknowledging the existence of 
wuless attempis to provoke will' 
only encourage more of the same 

On Ihe other band, if people 
allow ignorant, illogical, and repug- 
nant proposals to go unchallenged, 
that silence may be misconstrued as 
approval. 

Consider some of what Beckley 
advocated in his diatribe on 
Shannon Faulkner's admittance to 
The Citadel, a formerly male-only 
military academy, and her subse- 
quent decision to drop oui: 

* Beckley asserled that 
"Faulkner attended The Citadel for 
Ihe reason of promoting "wom- 
ankind," and for that treason she 
should be burnt at the slake." 

Since when did the advancement 
of career opponunilies for women 
become treason? And why should 
It merit death by torture? The 
V.mcan's Office of the Inquisition 
already tried huniing women alive 
for a couple of centuries, but lhat 
approach tailed to prevent women, 
in the long run, from asserting 
themselves. 

When I consider the lack of visi- 
ble dissent on our campus to that 
quote's absurd devaluation of 
women's lives, I wonder whether 
there would have been similar 
silence if the editor had called for 
gassing Jews or lynching Blacks 
who fight institutionalized bigotry. 

* Beckley exhibited an extreme 
double standard when, after noting 



that several other cadets dropped 
out of The Citadel (all of whom 
were male), he focused his bitter 
attacks exclusively against 
Faulkner. 

By comparison, those male 
drop-outs had it easy. None of 
those men who tried and failed lo 
make it through The Citadel's "hell 
week" training had lo fight two- 
year court battles just to get their 
feet in the door None of ihose men 
who failed spent two years prior lo 
eniermg the school as objects of 
hatred and ridicule on nationally 
broadcast radio lalk shows, 

I personally don't condemn die 
male cadets or Faulkner for 
attempting to achieve a difficult 
goal and failing. But since Beckley 
condemns Faulkner, "for the reason 
of promoting 'womankind,' " why 
doesn't he find die male drop-outs 
comparably "treasonable" for failed 
efforts to promote "mankind"? 

* Beckley employed a logical 
fallacy when he impugned 
Faulkner's motives for entering The 
Citadel, on the basis that "she could 
have received an education" at 
other military schools like West 
Point or the Virginia Military 
Institution, where female cadets are 
allowed. How does it follow thai 
because barriers to female entry at 
those schools no longer exist, gen- 
der barriers at another military 
school are therefore justified? Or, 
is Beckley now in favor of female 
inclusion, but only at diose other 
schools? To paraphrase Freud. 
Beckley doesn'i seem to know 
what he wanu. 

As for whether or nol women 
meril fairness and respecl in our 
society in general, however. 
Beckley made himself clear when 
he wrote. "It's a man's world, babe. 
Get used lo it "

Having a few connections here 
at The Communicator. 1 have the 
advantage of making the following 
announcement: I'M GETTING 
MARRIED! Now begins what 
every happy couple must endure, 
the pLinning of the big day. 

Many of you may wonder why 
we, or any other gay couple, would 
want to do this seeing lhat it is not 
yet legal to marry someone of the 
same sex. It is true that there are 
some things gay marriages miss out 
on. but it can come close lo being 
legal. This can be done with wills. 
legal contracts, name changes, joint 
credit accounts, and joint checking 
accounts. Together these all act lo 
legaliu: the union. 

That said, I need to decide what 
kind of wedding I want. Of course 
you realize that no matter what I 
chose to do, il has to have a queer 
flair to it 

The invitations will suU follow 
the proper wedding etiquette, like

From simply stress

Kaicn js a college siuduni who is

lines for papers pul pressure on her, 
along wj[h icnsions at work and at 
home. Karen has been under these 
pressures for months, and just "deals 

Wllhll." 

But laicly she has been waking 
up suddenly ii[ nighi with her heart 
rating, shoriness of breath, and a 
feeling Uisi she is going to die. 

Recenily while she was walking 
hurriedly from her car lo get ii&gt; 
class, (he feeling came over her 
again. She fell dizzy and as if her 
legs were going lo give out beneath 
her. 

Instead of going to class, she 
went loRciliMed. 

"Everyone experiences some 
anxiety," said Mary Kadlec, Psy.D, 
a clinical psychologist who has run 
an ongoing Dealing with Anxiety 
group at Parle Cenler. 

What differentiates normal anxi- 
ety, which everyone feels, from the 
hean-pounding panic stale? 

Anxiety disorders, according to 
experts, arc distinguished from 
everyday anxiety in that the fear is 
more intense, lasts longer, and can 
lead to phobias that interfere with 
your life. 

"Normal anxiety is situationally 



y 



-f 



that can be 
identified," 

According to an anxiety-help 
workbook by Edmund J. Bourne, 
about 8 percent of the population 
suffers from some type of anxiety 
disorder. TTie average age of onset is 
the mid- to late 20's and it is often 
accompanied by depression. 

Physiological symptoms of an 
anxiety attack may include rapid 
hcaribcai. muscle tension, queasi- 
ncss, dry mouth or sweating. 

It can sabotage your ability to 
aci, express yourself, or deal with 
everyday situations. 

It can make you feel even more 
unsure of yourself as the "fear of 
fear" sets in. Anticipatory anxiety is 
Uie fear brought on by merely think- 
ing about a particular situation, 
especially if it triggers the thought 
of a previous anxiety attack. 

Most people experiencing an 
anxiety attack for the first time.

driven, and passes," Kadlec said. 

"Anxiety attacks can happen out of 

the blue; there may be no 

situational 

trigger 



according to Kadlec, "typically go 
to the emergency room or their fam- 
ily physician, thinking they are 
dying." 

Although anxiety symptoms 
rarely arc a sign of impending death. 
Kadlec recommends visiting the 
doctor for a physical exam. 

Once physiological causes such 
as heart problems, allergies, hypo- 
glycemia or reactions to medicauon 
are ruled out, a diagnosis of panic 
disorder may be made if the paLeni 
has had four or more attacks, or has 
a persistent fear of having another 
attack. 

Anti-anxiety drugs may be pre- 
scribed if the anxiety is severe and 
interferes with daily life, but one 
problem with the drugs as a "cure" 
is that once they are withdrawn. 
panic attacks can return. 

The good news is that by reduc- 
ing stress and improving your physi- 
cal health, you can increase your 
resistance to overwhelming anxiety, 
according to Kadlec. 

Kadlec advocate;^ using muscle 
relaxation lo teach yourself how to 
calm down when anxiety begins to 
nse. She also teaches a technique of 
desensiiizaiion, a gradual exposure 
to the scary situation. 

Bourne recommends a personal 
wellness program that includes reg- 
ular exercise, daily practice of relax- 
ation, good nuUition, and a shift in 



attitude lo a more easygoing 
approach to life. 

"Take a look at your diet to make 
sure you're not drinking ions of caf- 
feinated beverages, and smoking 
two packs of cigarettes a day," said 
Kadlec. 

Also, eating too much sugar and 
little else can negatively alter your 
body's chemistry. Being out of bal- 
ance, such as when your sugar 
drops, can predispose you to 
episodes of anxiety, according to 
Kadlec. 

Body chcmisu-y is only one fac 
lor in the causation of panic disor 
der. Bourne's workbook cites a vari- 
ety of causes including heredity, 
family background, recent stressors, 
negative self-talk, and inability to 
express feelings. 

Some factors, such as heredity 
and upbnnging, can be a long-term 
predisposing cause. Other factors 
can trigger an attack, such as recent 
stressors and life changes. Still other 
factors maintain the fearful cycle, 
such as anxious self-talk, avoidance 
of phobic situations, and overuse of 
stimulants hke caffeine or ampheta- 
mines. 

People who experience an anxi- 
ety attack may feel embarrassment 
or hopelessness, and may avoid get- 
ling help. If help is not sought how- 
ever, the problem can worsen, 

'The fear of fear can generalize," 



Kadlec said. If an anxiety episode 
occurs in a supermarket, for exam- 
ple, the person may avoid that store, 
then all stores, and eventually be 
trapped at home 

Kadlec, who has treated many 
patients suffering from anxiety. 



bebeves Uiai if a person gets help for 
the problem, he or she can make a 
lot of progress. 

People who have experienced 
panic attacks. Kadlec said, can even- 
tually gel to a point where die disor- 
der no longer affects their lives. 



Scared speechless 



by Andris Sickmiller 
Staff Writer 

Doesn't everyone suffer at 
least some sort of stage fright? I 
know I certainly do. I've taken a 
speech class to help me gel over 
this phobia, but I 
llunked Uie ela,vs! 

i was so 
scared of "making 
a fool of myself." 1 
skipped class on my day: 
speak 

Many students suffer the 
aiuticty of performing a spe- 
cific role or task in front of a large 
group of people Even profession- 
al stage actors expenencc some 
stage fright With so many vic- 
tims of stage fright, you would 
Uiiiik diere would be a cure 

After a certain number of 
speeches, shouldn't a sufferer be 
used to public speaking? 




The answer is no. according to 
Larry Life, department chair of 
theater Me said he feels some 
stage fright every lime he per- 
forms on stage, and even when he 
enters a classroom 

"To conquer stage fright, one 
si get bold of that negative 
energy and make it 
positive," said Life. 
Stage fright is 
merely misplaced 
ncentralion, according to 
Life People tend lo focus on 
themselves and their nervous- 
ness rather ihan what diey have 
to do. 

"Concentrate on what you pre- 
sent to the audience, and not only 
the quality of presentation 
increases, but so does sclf-tonfi- 
dcnce," Life said. 

And before you enter that 
limelight, prepare yourself, for 
practice makes perfect.

IPFW student arrested in Israel 



by Rebecca Kocnig 
Slafr Writer 

Basic human rights are well 
respected in any country, such as 
ours, where people have died lo 
secure those nghls for their descen- 
dants Possibly this is why an 
American group called the 
Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) 
sought to stop Palestinians Trom 
being denied the basic right of edu- 
cation by the LsraeLs. 

Tbe CPT was making a symbolic 
siatcmcni by opening the tsracli 
sealed gate in front of Hebron 
University on Saturday. July 22. 
The gale was sealed in 1989 after 
new Palestinian students were 
denied passes to study in Jemsalem. 
Because this gale was scaled, stu- 
dents either had lo scale the wall or 
enter the university from a service 
entrance in the back that added at 
least ten minutes to their walking 
time. 

The gate was sealed as a symbol 
that soon the Palcsliniaiu would no 
longer be able to study in 



Jerusalem Ii also posed a safety 
measure because it limited access 
out of the university. Not having 
the gate opened permitted (he 
Israeli military to have more control 
over the students and university 




The Palestinians would have been 
severely punished for attempting to 
open the gate 

While opening the gate, three 
peacemakers and one Israeli were 
arrested. The ancsted members of 
the CPT were Wendy Lchmcn of 
Kidion, Ohio; Cliff Kindy and Dr 
Kaihy fCamphoefnei both of North 
Manchester. Ind Kamphocfner is 
a student at IPFW and an msiruclor 
at Manchester University The 



fourth person arrcsicd was Maxinc 
Nunn who is an Israeli member of 
the Hebron Solidarity Conunitlee. 
While initially Kindy was told they 
were arrested for opening the uni- 
versity gale, they were all officially 
charged with "refusal to leave a 
clascd miliiary zone." 

Kamphocfner was arrested by 
members of the Israeli Defense 
Force (IDF) in the street while car- 
rying stones away from the gate 
When they saw she was under 
arrest. Lehman and Nunn stood 
beside her and were arrested, also. 

Members of the IDF also arrest- 
ed Kindy He was on the top of the 
ten fool wall after using a hammer 
and chisel to break loose welding 
on the sealed gale and a sledgeham- 
mer to smash the cinder blocks 
placed in front of it News cameras 
were there and the scene received 
world wide coverage. 

The CPT has maintained its non- 
violent presence in Israel for over 
two months They hope to gain 
suppon for Palestinians in their dis- 
pute with the Israelis which has

noon as they play host to Northern 
Kentucky, Campus Access Channel 
6 will broadcast Ihe match live 
from the soccer field starting al 12 
p m. While die team is excited and 
somewhat nervous, most of the 
players said they would be able to 
pul the fact they were on television 
in die back of dietr mind once the 
game begins. 

"Being on TV. we feel massive 
support from the .';chool. It makes 
you want to play better I think. It is 
just amazing," said Coffee. 



Her efforts helped to improve the 
le;un's record lo an unblemished 6- 
going into this weekend 

Head Coach Tim Heffron was 
delighted when he learned that 
Teagarden had moved into the two 
spot, but was not surprised 

"II is obvious that Heather came 
into this year in exceptional shape. 
The ironic thing is that most of her 
kills this year have come at crunch 
time. She is definilely on a pace to 
be named All-Region if not All- 
American this season." said 
Heffron, 

Teagarden and the Volleydons 
will try lo continue in Uieir winning 
ways Uiis weekend as they host a 
docket full of games at the Gates 
Sports Center.

the interaction he geLs widi children. 

"I seem to be popular wiih the children. I really 
enjoy the kids. They are a lot of fun. Please do not call 
me die elephant man, I am a mastodon so you can call 
me Don," explained die prehistoric pachyderm. 

If there is one motto that Don lives by, it has to be 
that he is .sunply too legit to quit. His new image, alti- 
tude and diet have given him a new outlook on life 
and he can not wait lo perform 

"I am too legit lo quit." quipped the hairy monolith, 
"I look a short break, but now 1 am back."

integral part of die all spoas fall weekend hosted by 
die adiletic department. He hopes that everyone will 
Tind the time to join him as the Mastodon athletic 
teams play a full schedule of games Friday and

wisdom for everyone, 

"Be like me. too legit to quit Study hard and I
