Fall semester open-access 
computing requires login 



byCarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



Beginning fall semester, the 
IPFW Open-Access Computing Labs 
will require students to enter a 
login. 

"This is a standard opeminK 
procedure for any other major 
university with an open lab situa- 
tion," said Seana Lane, computer 
support specialist for Information 
Technological Services. 

IT Services will mail informa- 
tion packets to registered students 
and activation instructions near 
the beginning of the fall semester. 
Student consultants will be pre- 
pared and available to help stu- 
dents activate their accounts dur- 
ing the first weeks of the semester. 

New and returning students 
will need to activate their lab 
accounts. This will require going 



to one of the many open-access 
labs on campus and following the 
instructions that will have come in 
the mail. 

Returning students who have 
already activated their e-mail 
accounts will have the same 
accounts, with no changes, but 
will sdll need to activate their lab 
accounts to use the Open-Access 
facilities. 

"As part of the student com- 
puting ethics, it is outlined that 
students are accountable for their 
actions via email. If we have stu- 
dents or community members 
using email for non-legitimate uni- 
versity purposes we need to be 
able to determine who was using 
the workstation from which that 
message came," Lane said. 

Besides ensuring better secu- 
rity, IT Services wants to ensure 
that students are getting the com- 
puter use and time for academic 
purposes that they have paid for 



in the student technological fees. 

"We have a responsibility to 
the university to have standard 
security levels for our Internet 
resources, but we also have a 
responsibility to our students to 
have them use their student tech- 
nology fees in the best way possi- 
ble for their academic work. Those 
were two forces that came togeth- 
er and just demanded that we 
make this step," Lane said. 

Helmke Library's open-access 
lab will still provide community 
guests with limited access to infor- 
mational resources. 

IT Services does not expect 
this to be a difficult change and 
all students will receive instruc- 
tions for activating their lab 
account in the fall. 

"We have a responsibility to 
students who pay the fee to make 
sure that they are the ones who 
use the facilities," Lane said. 




Computing access for fall will require individual student logins to help secure 
accounts and monitor computer use. Open-access computing will still be available in 
Helmke Library for community members. Open-access computer labs are located in 
Kettler Hall G13, 204A and 204B, 217, and 211; Neff Hall B71 and B73; Engineering 
and Technology Building 305; Science Building G15; and Helmke Library. 



Campus Police and 
Safety do more than 
give parking tickets 



by MishannaWood, 
Managing Editor 



Eleven police officers, four security officers and 
three dispatchers watch over IPFW year round, 24 
hours a day. 

"1 always like to make sure new students know we 
have an escort service 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week, and I like to encourage students to use that ser- 
vice," said Lauren Denhartog, chief of Police and 
Safety for IPFW. 

In the event of an emergency, students can call 
6911 from any campus phone or emergency phone. 
According to Police and Safety, however, crime statis- 
tics are very low on campus, aside from one common 
problem. 

"If students leave personal items in their car or 
the library they should keep them out of sight. If they 
leave them in the library' they should make sure they 
have a person to watch their items. Theft of personal 
property is the biggest complaint," said Lt. Tom 
Haner. 

For additional information about Police and 
Safety call 481-6827 or visit their office and pick up a

Communicator editor urges 
student body to get involved 



by Adam Taylor, 
Editor 



As the editor of IPFWs stu- 
dent newspaper. The 
Communicator, I would first off 
like to personally welcome all of 
the new students to our campus. 

I would also like to add that 
in choosing IPFW as your univer- 
sity, you have made a wise deci- 
sion. 

In my two and a half years 
as an IPFW student, I have found 
that many students only come to 
school for their classes. 

This causes them to neglect 
the variety of things our campus 
offers to further the educational 
experience beyond the class- 
room. 

iPFW has a variety of inter- 
esting programs and organiza- 
tions that encourage student par- 
ticipation that can be very help- 
ful in life beyond college. 

The one I'd naturally recom- 
mend first is the one I participate 
in— The Communicator. 

Working at The 

Communicator has given me 
countless opportunities to not 
only improve my writing skills, 
but to improve my social skills as 
well. 

It has also given me the 
opportunity to develop my lead- 



ership skills as well as organiza- 
tional skills. 

All in all, the year I've 
worked for The Communicator 
has been very beneficial for me, 
as I'm sure it will be in the 
future. 

With this in mind. I would 
like to encourage anyone inter- 
ested in working for The 
Communicator to become 
involved. 

We are always looking for 
writers, specifically those who 
are interested in contributing to 
the campus. 

We are also always looking 
for photographers, graphic 
artists, and comic strip arts and 
anyone with a good work ethic. 

Any story ideas or leads can 
be passed on to us either in per- 
son, over the telephone or via e- 
mail. 

Finally, we encourage people 
to read The Communicator as 
much as possible and submit 
their opinions. 

If you have any questions 
regarding The Communicator, 
feel free to contact us at 481- 
6584 or by e-mailing us at stupa- 
periiholmes.ipfw.edu. You can 
also come see us in Walb 215. 

We look forward to hearing 
from you in the near future and 
we hope that you enjoy your 
freshman year. 



Campus services provide academic enhancement, assistance 



by Tracy Powell, 
Chief Reporter 



Incoming students have a variety of academic opportune 
ties beyond class time. Both academic assistance and enrich 
ment are available through different campus 
departments and services. 

Career Services in Walb 113 provides 
counseling, career assessment, testing, part- 
time and full-time job placement, career edu- 
cation, and assistance in experimental educa- 
tion. Career Services can be called at 481- 
6595. 

The Transitional Studies program offers 
free tutorial assistance, day and evening, for 
many introductory courses and is available 
to help students in developing reading, writ- 
ing, math and study skills. Transitional stud- 
ies can be reached at 481-6817 in Kettler 
202. 

The financial aid staff in Kettier 109 is 
available to assist students concerned about 
how to finance their education, using grants 
and scholarships, loans and part-time cam- 
pus employment as the means to provide 
aid. The office can be reached at 481-6820. 

The Writing Center also assists students, 
faculty and staff with any university-related writing project. 
Knowledgeable consultants will talk with students about their 
writing for any class at any stage of the writing process. 
Instructions for signing up for an appointment are posted out- 
side Kettler G3S, or students can drop in during posted hours 
for free and immediate help. The writing center can be con- 
tacted at 481-5740. 

Other departments in the academic support services 
include the African American student support services (481- 
6951), dean of students (481-6601), Hispanic student support 



"Whether students are 
looking for co-op 
experiences, the 
intellectual challenges 
of the honors program, 
or help with a research 
paper, IPFW can 
provide it all." 

-Steve Sarratore, 

interim assistant 

vice-chancellor of 

Academic Affairs 



(481-6847), international student support (481-6923), the 
learning resource center in the Helmke library (481-6519), and 
the registrar (481-6815). 

Programs available for academic enrichment include coop- 
erative education, honorary societies, the honors program, 
interdisciplinary certificate programs, national student 
exchange, the office of undergraduate research and creative 
endeavor, study abroad opportunities, and 
thirty-three academic clubs and 
organizations. 

Cooperative education may- 
be of particular interest to stu- 
dents wishing to gain valuable 
experience in a job related to their 
major while attending IPFW. Visit 
Neff 377 or call 481-6593 for 
more information. 

The Honors Program 
emphasizes experimental learning, 
classroom participation, and indi- 
viduality'. Students in the Honors 
Program receive priority registra- 
tion and honors program gradu- 
ates receive recognition that may- 
translate into job placement or 
preferential admission into gradu- 
ate school. Details are in the engi- 
neering and technology building 
in room 229E. 
Another opportunity for students to expand 
their educational horizons is to participate in the 
National Student Exchange (NSE). Through the 
NSE, students spend a semester or a year of study 
during their sophomore or junior year at one of 
more than 100 institutions. Students remain 
enrolled at IPFW while on exchange and credit 
earned on exchange is recorded as regular credit 
toward their degree. An NSE exchange must be 
planned in advance so if interested, visit Kettler 



110E or call 481-6814. 

"The academic opportunities for students here at IPFW are 
phenomenal. Whether students are looking for co-op experi- 
ences, the intellectual challenges of the honors program, or 
help with a research paper, IPFW can provide it all. I hope that 
all of the incoming students will take advantage of the opportu- 
nities that IPFW offers," said Steve Sarratore, Interim Assistance 
Vice-Chancellor of Academic Affairs.

Are extracurricular activities 



worthy of students' time?

lPFW's finals for the spring semester ended on May 7 
and high school seniors will be graduating in June. 

"Something new" is 
happening for both col- 
lege and high school stu- 
dents at this very 
moment. 

Many students will 
be starting a new summer 
job, moving to a different 
city or school or going 
into the military. 

For those of you 
beginning at 1PFW, The 
Communicator welcomes 
all of you and encourages 
you to get involved on 
campus. 

Simply attending 
class and doing the home- 
work is only half of the 
college experience. 

Anybody is qualified, as long as you're willing to learn. 

According to ail of the commercials advertised on tele- 
vision and on the radio, iPFW is the college that most area 
high school graduates attend. Therefore, some of you should 
already know each other and have a little background about 
Fort Wayne. 

Other new arrivals come from different colleges or 
countries. 

Experience at other colleges, knowledge from different 
cultures and knowledge about the area can be brought 
together to create innovative projects and activities within 
any campus group. 

Joining an activity at IPFW can help students meet new 
people, improve social skills and see the "lighter side" of 
college life. 

Lack of student involvement is a big problem on this 
campus. 




There never seems to be enough of it . 
For example, there seems to be a low turnout at sport- 
ing events (with exception to volleyball). During the student 
government elections, the presidency was the only position 
that had more than one candidate running for office, and 
there were only 150 students out of 11,000 who went to 
Indianapolis to ask legislators for more funds for the cam- 
pus community. 

The examples mentioned above are only a tiny portion 
of the activities available on campus. 
There Is something for everyone. 

Almost everj' depart- 
ment has an extra-curric- 
ular activities scheduled 
for student participation. 
There are also various 
sports teams on this cam- 
pus such as tennis, soft- 
ball, basketball and 
cross-country that active- 
ly recruit new members. 

If those don't interest 
you, there are two social 
fraternities and two 
sororities, as well as the 
Student Activities Board 
which bring a variety of 
events to campus. 

If you still feel that 
this is too much, you can 
volunteer to help out for a few hours at various events. 

All you have to do is look around at the bulletin boards 
on campus. They are always filled with flyers. 
The opportunities are endless. 

It only takes a phone call or walk to the next building to 
become involved with a campus activity. 

We understand that many of you will have jobs and will 
be attending class full time but it is possible to participate in 
extracurricular activities. 

Students we have worked with that are involved with 
activities are able to handle all their responsibilities. 

We believe that you will find the time and effort well 
worth your while. 

We think that the "commuter campus" excuse for a lack 
of participation has been overused and is quite annoying. 

We would tike you, as incoming students, to make a 
change on this campus. 



College experiences enhance student's life 




by Adam Taylor, Editor 



As I patiently wait for the final exam in 
my English correspondence class to arrive 
from Kentucky, 1 realize that the end of an 
era is soon approaching for me. 

The era began approximately three years 
ago, right around this time of the year. 1 had 
graduated from high school a semester early 
and moved in with my grandparents to attend 
college in Ashland, Kentucky, 

I really enjoyed myself there, made a few 
friends and even began dating an old girl- 
friend again from the summer oT 1995. 
Things appeared to be going great. 

They would change, however, as most 
things do. 

Relations between myself and my grand- 
parents deteriorated and I found myself 
spending most of my time away from them. 

My girlfriend and I began fighting more 
often and I saw my other friends less 
frequently. 



The events of my first semester in college 
.•came^o, 1 a high-water mark when. I received 
my first college report card. I received an A in 
my honors class, a D in history, English and 
government (my three strongest subjects) and 
an F in algebra. 1 left the semester with a 1.4 
GPA. 

My already failing relations with my fam- 
ily and friends in Kentucky heightened over 
the summer and I somehow found myself liv- 
ing with my parents again in Bluffton the fol- 
lowing fall. 

My grades were so poor that IPFW, the 
only college I could really turn to with 
respect, wouldn't accept me for another 
semester. 

I spent the fall semester of 1996 taking 
four correspondence classes, the last of which 
1 am finally on the verge of completing. 

Far past depression after such a horren- 
dous turn of events, the spring semester of 
1997 would paint a new picture for me. 

I focused primarily on academics, only 
devoting the weekends to socializing, and 
slowly raised my GPA up to a 2.0. 

Doing so, however, involved more than 
efforts by myself. 

Although I did make a good effort, I was 
helped out a lot by understanding teachers 
and supportive friends and family-an asset I 
eliminated for myself the year before. 

The time came for me when 1 was to 
transfer back to Kentucky, a place I love more 
than almost anything in the world, and I 



refused to do it I had found the perfect col- 
lege for m&gt;self, full of great people, great 
teachers and informative courses. 

M&gt; devotion for the school intensified as 
I became more involved with university 
organizations. 

At first i planned to join the Student 
Senate but ultimately ended up writing for 
The Communicator. 

Now, a year later, I'm happy to say that 
the same person that said he'd graduate and 
live in Kentucky the rest of his life two years 
ago is looking forward to graduating from 
IPFW sometime next year (if the powers that 
be permit it), 

Speaking from two and a half years of 
attending IPFW, I'd have to say that it is prob- 
ably one of the most rewarding universities 
I've attended. The organizations, such as stu- 
dent government, SAB and (of course) The 
Communicator have to be some of the better 
ways on campus to get to know people. 

The teachers are more than willing to 
help their students, both inside and outside 
the classroom, and the academic facilitation 
programs offer nothing but top quality. 

My advice to incoming freshmen, as I 
begin a promising new era of college life, is 
plain and simple: Make the best of what IPFW 
has to offer. It turned my college career 
around and has greatly influenced my life. It 
can do the same for you, If you let it 



MEMORIES OF AN IPFW GRADUATE 



by Jodi Schierling, Guest Writer 



Has it really been four years 
already? Eight semesters, 15 plus 
hours of class work a semester, 
one summer course. 1 can hardly 
believe it has all added up to a 
completed degree. All of the rela- 
tives and friends say, "I thought 
you just graduated from high 
school!" That seems all too true. 

According to higher educa- 
tion standards and the require- 
ments of the school of Arts and 
Sciences, 1 am ready to begin my 
lifetime of learning, so they have 
bid me farewell and good fortune. 

All the hard work has really 
paid off, and it really has been a 
great four&gt;ears. 

The endless reading lists, all- 
nighters, and exam anxiety are all 
over and I feel confident that I 
have received an exceptional 
education. 

When I first thought about 
going to college, I had a few 
other institutions besides 
Indiana University-Purdue 
University at Fort Wayne in mind. 

After checking them out, 1 
found I was most comfortable 
here at the Fort Wayne campus, 
not to mention the affordabiliiy 
of tuition at IPFW, cost of living, 
and job availability in Fort 



Wayne. 

I'll be honest. IPFW had 
always been known to me as 
'Harvard on the Highway" or 
"Bypass High," so I was sort of 
apprehensive about what kind of 
education 1 would receive. 

It was comforting to discover 
in the first semester that my 
classes were just as challenging 
and informative as any of my 
other friends' classes at different 
universities. 

Also a plus was the fact that I 
was learning from actual profes- 
sors in most of my courses. 

It didn't feel like the profes- 
sor was standing in front of the 
classroom imparling knowledge 
that was onlj comprehensible to 
him or her and then leaving for 
his or her next speaking 
engagement 

The instructors were very 
available to all the students and 
most were concerned with us 
mastering ihe material covered in 
a semester. 

I found this especially true 
when I began to work on my 
major courses in the communica- 
tion department. 

These educators were very 
approachable, open to new ideas, 



and flexible when it came to our 
busy lives. 

I don't think it is inaccurate 
to say that there may be commu- 
nication departments equal to, 
but none better than the one at 
IPFW. 

Everyone seems to talk about 
how hard it is to meet people at 
IPFW, but 1 found that the more 1 
was involved in organizations and 
programs on campus, the more 
people 1 met 

There are religious organiza- 
tions, student government, hon- 
ors organizations, race or ethnic 
affiliations, sports teams and 
many more places to plug in and 
meet people. 

I would advise any student 
coming to IPFW to get involved in 
what he or she is most interested 
in to have the best college 
experience. 

Not only are these groups a 
great place to meet people with 
similar interests, but also to find 
support and advice. 

I would also advise any stu- 
dent looking to get the most out 
to their education at IPFW to take 
advantage of all the services and 
programs offered. 

Career Services has profes- 



sional job seekers who can help 
point you to job opportunities 
during school and find a good fit 
after graduation. 

Go there early and explore 
all of your options. 

Take a job-fit test or person- 
ality assessment to see what voca- 
tion would best suit you. 

The Cooperative Education 
office can get you that extra expe- 
rience in your field that employ- 
ers are looking for. 

Go to another university for 
a semester or a year with the 
National Student Exchange 
Program. 

Over 100 different universi- 
ties participate in exchanging stu- 
dents each year. 

I went to Louisiana State 
University for my sophomore 
year and it was a great opportuni- 
ty to experience a large university 
atmosphere. 

Use these services to their 
fullest potential. 

The people working for the 
services really know what they 
are doing and are there to serve 
students. 

Take it slow and enjoy these 
years. 



Transition and change 

by 
Mishanna Wood, Managing Editor 

Now that the spring semester has ended 
and summer is right around the corner, it is 
time to say goodbye to graduated students and 
hello to Incoming freshmen. 

'Tis the season to introduce new students 
to IPFW, 

I remember the summer of 1997 when I 
was a high school graduate beginning at IPFW. 

During orientation, it felt great to be start- 
ing something new and going on to what was 
the next step for me after high school-college. 

While walking through the tour of the 
campus, my heart was racing. I was sad, ner- 
vous and excited. 

Less than two months ago, I was in a place 
where everyone knew each others' first and 
last names. 

I was now on a college campus where I 
knew not one soul. It was a huge compared to 
my high school that consisted of approximate- 
ly 500 students. 

I was worried about the difficulty and 
location of my classes, and I felt as if I had a 
long way to go before I would ever graduate. 

I had no idea what 1 wanted to major in. 

On the other hand, it felt great to know 
that I was moving ahead in life by starting my 
dream to go to college. 

At that time I had to deal with a lot of 
emotions and college seemed to be the most 
stable thing I had. 

During the last month of my senior year I 
had broken up with my boyfriend and moved 
to a new city that was far away from my closest 
friends. 

So much for having a summer together 
with all my buddies before we all went our sep- 



arati 



ways, 



At that point, the summer after I graduat- 
ed from high school was one of the most dras- 
tic changes I had ever experienced. 

Two years have passed since that 
metamorphosis. 

I am now a sophomore here and I'm get- 
ting along fine. 

I have a declared major and have gained 
experience in my chosen field of work. 

I joined the cross-country team for a short 
time my freshman year and have been working 
at this paper since the fall of 1998. 

There are a few people that know me by 
my first and last name. 

The emotions and situations 1 had are 
very typical after high school. 

I know they are a part of life and are very 
minimal compared to what is to come in the 
future. 

So far I have had ups and downs such as 
getting good grades, getting bad grades, mov- 
ing away from home and moving back in, los- 
ing my grandmother, finding money for 
school, putting up with an old car, changing 
jobs and meeting friends. 

We are constantly enduring "ups and 
downs." 

I believe that everything that happens to 
you in life helps you grow and helps form who 
you are. 

For those of you out there who are wor- 
ried about entering college, the onlj thing I 
can tell you is what has worked best for me: 
being persistent, keeping a positive attitude 
and breathing. 

I have learned the hard way that if I don't 
do these things everything is twice as difficult 

I wish you all good luck at IPFW.

SPEA welcomes new IPFW students 



Students often have never 
heard of SPEA hefore they 
arrive on campus. SPEA, the 
School of Public and 
Environmental Affairs, is an 
academic division of Indiana 
University on the IPFW cam- 
pus which awards associate 
and bachelor degrees In pub- 
lic affairs, criminal justice, 
health services administration 
and environmental policy. 

SPEA was founded as a 
response to the needs and 
problems of modern 
society-needs that were not 
being addressed by other, 
more traditional, schools. 

SPEA's scope is wide, 
addressing such issues as 
global competition for jobs, 
the viability of the nation's 
cities, high school dropouts 
and delinquency, unmet 
needs of the elderly and dis- 
abled, and environmental 
pollution. 

What is a public or envi- 
ronmental affair? It's an issue 
or a problem that affects the 



quality of life for the citizens 
of this planet. 

What kind of work do 
public affairs graduates do? 

Among other things, they 
resolve disputes through alter- 
native methods, protect water 
resources, manage health 
care, address cultural issues 
in health care delivery, man- 
age non-profit organizations, 
address racial segregation and 
neighborhood change, manage 
urban services, improve air- 
line and highway safety, 
reclaim urban brownfields, 
protect and restore wetlands, 
and clean up hazardous waste. 

What kind of career 
might you be considering if 
you majored in criminal jus- 
tice? You might be interested 
in law enforcement on the 
local, county, state or federal 
level. 

You might want to be a 
railroad or postal inspector, or 
a loss prevention specialist or 
investigator. Or you may wish 
to work in crime investigation, 



the court system, corrections, 
juvenile or adult probation, 
alternative programs, or crime 
prevention. There are many 
possibilities. 

During their last few 
semesters before graduation, 
many SPEA students take 
advantage of the opportunity 
to do an internship with a 
local, regional, stale or nation- 
al public agericy in order to 
learn more about their field of 
study, to link their classroom 
work with the real world, and 
to network with professionals 
in their chosen field.

about SPEA degree programs,

student coordinator, or check

Women's studies offers 
bachelor's degree 



In 1992, IPFW became 
the first campus of any 1U or 
Purdue campus to offer a B.A. 
degree in women's studies. 

Women's studies is an 
interdisciplinary academic 
program focusing on women's 
achievements, status, and 
concerns. 

Anyone who is interested 
in issues of quality at work or 
school, in families and rela- 
tionships, in politics or the 
arts, in science and technolo- 
gy, and in health care or 
human services may want to 
look into a women's studies 
degree. 

To major in women's 
studies, you must fulfill the 
requirements of both the 
School of Arts and Sciences 



general education and take 30 
credits in approved women's 
studies courses, as described 
in the IPFW Bulletin. The total 
amount of credits for the 
bachelor's degree is 124. 

An associate degree has a 
total of 62 credit hours, 15 
credits of which are in 
women's studies courses, with 
the remainder being general 
education and elective cours- 
es. 

A minor requires 15 
credits of approved women's 
studies courses. 

Most women's studies 
courses at IPFW are offered 
through social science classes, 
such as sociology, psychology, 
political science, and anthro- 
pology or humanities classes 



such as art history, literature, 
philosophy and history. 

Women's studies courses 
fulfill the elective require- 
ments for humanities, social 
science and science as well as 
some general education 
requirements. 

We suggest that first 
semester college students 
should choose courses at the 
100 or 200 level. 

For more information 
about women's studies one 
can go to its office in 
Classroom Medical Rm. 272 
or call 481-6711.

Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism 

Management Program 

provides career options 



tcin 



■■ ■■ ■ 



IPFW's Hotel, Restaurant, 
and Tourism Management 
Program is a well kept secret 
on campus. 

While it was founded in 
1976 as a two-year degree, 
few students know that it is in 
the process of becoming a 
four-year program. 

The hotel and restaurant 
business is exciting, and world 
tourism is expanding rapidly. 
All of these opportunities 
mean success for the IPFW 
graduate. 

"The time to check out 
this fantastic career is now," 
said John Knight, director of 
the Hotel, Restaurant, and 
Tourism Management 

Program. "Besides the Dinner 
Series, in which students 



experience fine dining 
throughout Fort Wayne while 
learning about management 
styles, the program features a 
Tour Series in which students 
attend hotel/restaurant shows 
in New York and Chicago and 
travel to Las Vegas and Walt 
Disney World to learn what 
tourism involves." 

Other excursions are 
planned throughout the acad- 
emic year through class work 
to help the student better 
understand the hospitality 
industry. 

The Hotel, Restaurant, 
and Tourism Management 
Club involves students in 
additional opportunities such 
as catering proms, serving at 
elegant affairs, and visiting 



restaurants to consider join- 
ing the club. 

In fact, this fall a new 
travel writing program will 
involve club members with 
the journalism program on 
campus to critique restau- 
rants, write about exotic desti- 
nations, and learn about 
careers in travel writing. 

Students interested in 
learning more about the pro- 
gram or club should contact 
Knight or Consumer and 
Family Sciences secretary, 
Louise Pruse, at 481-6562 or 
see both of them at their 
offices in Neff Hall 330.

IPFW's chapter of the American Criminal Justice Association 
looking for new members, planning big events for fall semester 



The criminal justice orga- 
nization, Lambda Alpha 
I p-.il"n. originated at San Jose 
State College, San Jose, 
California during the summer 
of 1937. 

Membership was limited 
to police academy graduates 
until 1946, when membership 
was opened to any sworn 
peace officer with a college 
education. 

In 1965. the Fraternity 
was reconstructed to include 
the entire country. 

In 1965, the name was 
changed to American Criminal 
Justice Association / Lambda 
Alpha F.psilon to reflect its 
expanded scope and national 
character. 

Through various changes, 
the name is read today as 
American Criminal Justice 
Association - Lambda Alpha 
Lpsilon. 

Organized into six 
regions throughout the coun- 



try, the Fraternity stretches 
from Spokane, Washington to 
Florida and from Baltimore, 
Maryland to Hawaii. 

Most chapters are located 
at two and four year colleges 
and universities, although 
some are organized indepen- 
dently as professional chap- 
ters. 

People with Lambda 
Alpha Epsilon keys include 
Earl Warren, former Chief 
Justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court; J. Edgar Hoover, former 
director of the FBI and August 
Vollmer, professor of Police 
Administration at the 
University of California at 
Berkeley. 

In the fall of 1998, crimi- 
nal justice majors and David 
May, assistant professor of 
Public and Environmental 
Affairs, chartered the Alpha 
Omega Psi chapter of the 
national criminal justice fra- 
ternity, Lambda Alpha 



Epsilon. 

By chartering a chapter 
at IPFW, students now have 
the opportunity to be a fellow 
member of a fraternity with 
approximately »,000 members 
in more than 100 chapters 
nationwide, with colleagues 
ranging from college students 
to police officers and other 
members of the law enforce- 
ment commuiity throughout 
the country. 

During the 1998-99 acad- 
emic year. Alpha Omega Psi 
has brought a number of 
guest speakers from the crimi- 
nal justice community in 
northeast Indiana to lecture 
on topics of interest to stu- 
dents majoring in criminal 
justice, 

The guest speakers dis- 
cussed topics ranging from 
how to prepare for an inter- 
view with a criminal justice 
agency to the psychology of 
combat and the use of tech- 



nology in policing. 

The guest speakers 
included Kim Huffine and 
Danielle Inman, Allen County 
Prosecutor's Office; Dan 
Hannaford, Fort Wayne Police 
Chief; Dr. Phillip O' 
Shaughnessey, Allen County 
Coroner; Dr. Paul Whitesell, 
Fort Wayne Police Academy; 
and Pat Smaliwood of the Fort 
Wayne Victim's Assistance 
Department. 

The Alpha Omega Psi 
chapter now has 24 members 
who elected Karen Brown as 
president, Holly Castiaux- 
Logan as vice-president, Ann 
F. Rivir as secretary, and 
Joshua Stultz as treasurer for 
the 1999-2000 officers. 

During the 1999-2000 
academic year, Alpha Omega 
Psi plans to offer guest speak- 
ers such as Linda Buskirk, the 
current mayoral candidate, 
Ron Buskirk of Criminal 
Investigations and a demon- 



stration with trained police 
dogs. 

The criminal justice club 
is also planning a golf tourna- 
ment in the fall. 

The guest speakers and 
meetings will be held on the 
fourth Monday of each month 
at noon in Kettler 243. 

If you have a guest speak- 
er or an event which would 
interest you, contact an offi- 
cer and give us your ideas. 
You may join the local chapter 
for only S10 per year and the 
National association for only 
S30 per year. 

If you have any questions 
or concerns, please contact 
Karen Brown at 471-9387 or 
Holly Castiaux-Logan at 481- 
6586.

Delta Sigma Theta newest 

addition to IPFW's 

sorority life 



Delta Sigma Theta is the 
newest sorority at IPFW. The 
chartering members were ini- 
tiated on March 31 and the 
chapter of Tau Gamma was 
chartered on April 8. The 
charter members are NaTosha 
Gatson, Stephanie Hart, Jenee' 
Johnson, Tyra Moore, Nakkiya 
Young, Cassandra Frantz, 
Tracey Rozier and Geneva 
Burgess. 

The first chapter was 
founded at Howard University 
in 1913 by 22 young women 
who were not happy with 
their sorority at that time. 
They felt that more communi- 
ty service was needed and 
that the titles of the officers 
were frivolous and unneces- 
sary, so they founded their 
own sorority. One of the 
major milestones of Delta. 
Sigma Theta was marching in 
the womeR's ( suCfrage march. 

Today the sorority has: 
over 19 5,000 members 



around the world. The unoffi- 
cial mascot is the elephant 
and the colors are crimson 
and cream.'Some Deltas that 
you may have heard of are 
Barbara Jordan, Aretha 
Franklin, Lena Horn, Shirley 
Chisholm and Patricia Roberts 
Harris. For more information

Campus 

Ministry 

offers 

spiritual 

growth 



Campus Ministry seeks to 
provide a safe and stimulating 
place for students, staff am" 
faculty at IPFW to explor 
their spirituality, investigate 
the possibility- of a relation- 
ship with God and to nurture 
and nourish that relationship 
once established. 

According to Campus 
Ministry, it desires to remind 
the academic community at 
IPFW on an ongoing basis that 
the secular and the sacred, 
reason and faith, must be held 
balance in any honest intel- 
lectual search. 

Campus Ministry believes 
that at IPFW, or any other 
large college campus, it is 
often difficult to find those 
people who really care or 
have the time to listen. One 
of their main objectives is to 

a place where you can 
come if you need to talk. 

The campus minister, Ben 
Gates, has an office located on 
he third floor of Heir 
Library'. Room 362. He keeps 
regular office hours and can 
ually be found on campu; 
three full days each week 
Gates invites vou to stop in tc

Sports Center reaches out to students 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 



IPFW traditionally has 
built Its athletic program on 
pride, hard work, and disci- 
pline, all of which are goals 
Tor any student, athlete, or 
program. 

Offering 12 intercolle- 
giate sports, which provides 
an opportunity for almost any 
student, the athletic program 
has received many honors 
both on and off the court.. „ 

Men compete in baseball, 
basketball, cross country, vol- 
leyball, soccer and tennis, 
while the women compete in 



basketball, cross country, ten- 
nis, volleyball, soccer, and 
softball. 

Both the men and the 
women call the IPFW Gates 
Sports Center home for their 
games. 

Established in 1979, in 
honor of longtime area sports- 
caster Hilliard Gates, the 
68,106 square foot, tri-Ievel 
facility features three full- 
sized basketball and volley- 
ball courts, and has a seating 
capacity of 2,700. 

Along with the gym, 
other interesting features of 
the Sports Center are the fit- 
ness and conditioning rooms. 

Top of the line workout 



equipment is available such as 
Nautilus, free weights, Air- 
Dyne stationary bicycles, 
treadmills, stairmasters, slant 
boards, and stretch mats. 

Also in the Sports Center 
is a 1/9-mile indoor running 
track and five racquetball and 
handball courts. 

The room also features a 
wooden floor area with a full- 
length mirroi and attached 
bar for aerobic and dance 
activities. 

Nautilus clinics, fitness 
assessments, along with 
IPFW's comprehensive well- 
ness program, Well Power, are 
additional offerings available 
to the IPFW community. 



The Sports Center is not 
only a place to work out but 
also serves as an office to the 
athletic coaches, directors, 
and other athletic faculty. 

The basement is also 
used as a classroom and 
makes Gales one of the most 
busy buildings on campus. 

This year, IPFW will host 
the Men's Volleyball Final 
Four along with an inaugural 
soccer tournament. 

So expect the Gates 
Sports Center to be filled with 
the pride and passion which 
make IPFW athletics as special 
as it is.

From the Director's Desk 



Greetings from the Hilliard 
Gates Sports Center. 1 want to 
personally welcome students 
to IPFW. Since I am relatively 
new to the campus myself, we 
begin our journey together. 

Although I am not a 
Hoosier by birth, I have quick- 
ly come to appreciate the peo- 
ple of Fort Wayne and the 
campus community in partic- 
ular. As a student, your selec- 
tion of this university is an 
excellent choice. The dedicat- 
ed faculty, friendly atmos- 
phere and opportunities avail- 
able all blend together to give 
you a first-rate higher educa- 
tion experience. 

Many of the opportunities 
come in the form of intercol- 
legiate athletics. IPFW has a 
strong history of competitive 



sports and I would urge you 
to explore the possibilities 
offered through the variety of 
varsity and intramural teams. 

If your talent doesn't run 
towards participation in any 
of the athletic teams, your 
presence at upcoming events 
is vital. The attendance and 
support of loyal fans is critical 
to the success of our 
programs. 

We at the Gates Center are 
extremely excited about the 
season ahead of us. Find your 
niche as participant and/oi 
fan and help us channel that 
Hoosier spirit into a highly 
competitive, winning tradition 
at IPFW. 

Walter Bowman 
Director of Athletics

IPFW CONFERENCES 



QWC 



The Great Lakes Valley Conference is regarded as one of 
the nation's strongest NCAA Division II conferences as it 
enters its 18th season of competition. 

The GLVC originated in 1972 when three athletic direc- 
tors got together to discuss forming a basketball conference. 

As of today the GLVC has 11 schools: Lewis, Bellarmine, Missouri-St. Louis, Wisconsin- 
Parkside, IPFW, Ojiincy, Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville, Indianapolis, Northern 
Kentucky, Kentucky Wesleyan and Southern Indiana. 

IPFW participates in the GLVC in every' sport except men's volleyball, where it partici- 
pates in the MIVA. 



Ml'VA 



The Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association has 
played an integral part in the development of IPFW Athletics. 
Formed in 1961, the MIVA started out with eight 
schools: Ohio State, Wittenberg. George Williams, Ball State, 
Earlham, Michigan State, Lansing College, and Decroit Institute of Technology. 

The MIVA was the first of its kind in the Midwest and was used primarily for the orga- 
nization and promotion of college volleyoall. Since 1961, more than 40 schools have compet- 
ed at either the club or varsity level. 

Currently, the conference has seven varsity members: IPFW, Ball State, Ohio State, 
Lewis, Loyola-Chicago, Quincy, and Clarke College. 

The winner of the MIVA Tournament will earn the at-large bid to the NCAA Final Four.
