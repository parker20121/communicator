IPSGA 

Student senators approve finance bill 




Student leaders 
choose funding 
guidelines 



On Monday at noon, the Indiana- 
Purdue Student Government 
Association's Student Senate met to 
discuss several bilk and funding to the 
Anthropology club. 

The first step of business was passing 
i bill sponsored by Senator Chris 
Jouse allocating S200 lo the 
Anthropology club for a conference in 
Washington. D.C.. 

The Senate then allocated funding for 
refreshments at the Toni Morrison cele- 
bration held on Tuesday. 

After the allocation of funding , the 

enalors passed Bill 1993/94-M, 

IPSGA Financial Guidelines.'* This 

'ill sets the guidelines for requesting 
funding by campus organizations and 
special interest groups on campus. 

According lo the guidelines, campus 
wide organizations will make their bud- 
get requests to the Yearly Budget 
Committee, but the special interest 
groups will fall under the jurisdiction of 
the Student Senate. 

ator Douse expressed his concern 
tbe difference in procedures for 
funding by special interest groups and 
campus wide organizations. 

Vice-President Mike Heit explained 
that because these groups are always 
improving the quality of campus, they 
'.ve recurring funding because the 
groups need the funding from IPSGA 
lo function. 

"If a group is associated or has close 
ties with a department, hpw can they 
not be considered a special interest 
group?" Mary Bender, on IPFW stu- 
dent, asked. 

Marian Zimmerman, student senate 
jJwmt explained the reasoning in 
determining the status. 

"The group has lo be deemed by (he 
business office as contributing lo cam- 
pus life." Zimmerman said. "If you 
wont to sec if a group could be deemed 
a campus organization, I could set up a 
meeting with tbe Student Affairs 
Committee and a business representa- 

She mentioned campus wide organiza- 
tions such as The Communicator, Fine 
Arts, Purdue-Indiana Theatre (PIT), 



Forensics, and IPSGA 

According to Bill-M the definition of 
a special interest group is "a recognized 
student group with a specific interest in 
one particular area." 

Zimmerman also fell because of the 
constont turnover of the Senate this was 
the best piece of legislation sbe has 
seen. She believes these guidelines 
would help insure thai all groups are 
treated fairly. 

The old 50/50 rule guidelines were as 
followed: 1) half of the funding would 
come from tbe student group and 
IPSGA would match the funding, 2) 
This would allow at least a minimum 
amount of funding to the student orga- 
nizations. 

Under the new guidelines, special 
interest groups must come before 
Student Senate lo request funding of 
events. The senate will then determine 
how much funding will be allocated lo 
the group with a limitation of SI000. 

Senator Mark King showed concern in 
this limitation because later on in the 
bill, section 6.3 there is an exception to 
the S 1000 limit 

Tbe exception basically slates that a 
special interest group will be allowed to 
receive more funding with a two-thirds 
vole from senate. 

Section 6.1.1 reads as follows: 'The 
event in question must have a tangible 
benefit lo the campus and lo tbe student 

Another area that created some dis- 
cussion was section 6,2.6. Tbe particu- 
lar segment read, "Once Funds have 
been allocated to a special interest 
group, those funds can only be used for 
the specified items that were presented 
in the budget. Groups may move those 
funds only wilb the approval of the 
IPSGA Vice-President of Finance." 

"Why docs tbe Vice-President of 
Finance make the decisions when 
Senate gives the groups the money?" 
Senator Mark King asked. 

Dialogue on this issue quickly lead to 
an amendment being made on the floor 
to change the wording from "approval" 

"Vice-President of Finance is seen as 
a caretaker and should be able to make 
tbe correct decisions," Richardson said, 
in defense of Heit. 

There ore some guidelines created to 
prevent student organizations from • 
allocating funding which would result 
in a twelve month probation period lim- 
iting funding to S500. 

Tbe bill is now waiting for IPSGA 
Student Body Ptesidenl Rajat Suri's

tives of the student body of IPFW and 
as the unofficial trustees of forty (40) 
percent of the money collected from

leaders 

Zimmerman explains 
importance of meetings 
and conflict resolution 



As a part of tbe current Leadership 
series on campus. Marian Zimmerman, 
dean of students and director of Career 
Services, provided students with infor- 
mation on how to run an efficient 
meeting. 

Zimmerman focused on several issues 
concerning ranging from bow to run a 
meeting to the type of environment a 
meeting is held in, to handling con- 
flicts. 

"A lot of responsibility falls on the 
chairperson or president," Zimmerman 
said. "They have to decide when a vote 
is die right time to vole." 

She also staled that it is the chairper- 
son or president's responsibility to put 
all of the facts on the table so everyone 
has an understanding of the meeting. 

The first step in running a good meet- 
ing is by establishing an agenda, out- 
lining what will take place at the meet- 
ing. 

The next step is making sure enough 
time is allotted to discuss an issue to 
prevent people from becoming bored 
and to keep people from having side- 
line conversations among themselves. 

As far as sideline conversations axe 
concerned, sbe discussed bow ihcy 
take away from meetings because no 
one is paying attention to tbe person 
who has the floor.

Chair resigns, 
professor's contract 
not renewed 



Theatre depart- 
ment undergoes 
several faculty 
changes 

By F. Lane Douse, 

Editor In Chief, and 

Sarah Miller, Acting 

Managing Editor 

Last Friday, several concerned stu- 
dents met with Gerald Ratliff, dean of 
tbe School of Fine and Performing 
Arts, to discuss the current changes in 
the theatre department. 
One of the issues brought to Ratliff was 
the decision not to renew the contract 
of Neil LaButc. assistant professor of 
Theatre. LaButc, hired last year, is tbe 
only professor who teaches playwriting 
on campus. At the time of his hiring, 
the job description focused on employ- 
ing someone With a playwriting back- 
ground. 

Several of tbe students at the meeting 
fell that if LaBuie was eliminated, the 
job of playwright instructor would be 
eliminated as well. 

"Something had lo be done in a quick 
positive way. I was taking initiative on 
behalf of tbe students. I realize that I 
cannot satisfy everyone. A personnel 
decision was made, the program was 
not changed. The current job descrip- 
tion is not exclusively in playwriting; 
acting and directing are also included." 
Ratliff said. 

The reasons for LaBute's contract not 
being renewed are unclear. 



"The reason they stated on paper lo 
me was because I didn't fit the job 
description,'" LaButc said. 

Tbe Communicator contacted Ratliff 
to clarify the situation. 
"I will not discuss personnel iss 
with you. I just don't feel that it is pro- 
fessional," Ratliff responded. 

Several students in tbe department feel 
that Labute's elimination was unni 

"I think that it was extremely prema- 
ture," Gina Cray, an IPFW student. 
said, "Neil was told that be would have 
a position here for a while. He bought a 
borne and enrolled bis wife in college. 
Now he doesn't have a job." 

The theatre department is undergoing 
another change as well. The cui 
department chair. Steven SaiTatore. bos 
resigned as chair, but will remain 
staff as on associate professor. 

The Communicator received infor 
lion that slated one of the reasons 
bis resignation was a conflict of rr 
agcmenl styles. 

Sarratore suggested that this was 
of the reasons. However, a variety of 
things led to this decision. 

"My job here is fairly complete. I 
didn't feel at this point it would be an 
advantage to myself, the school or the 
university lo stay on as chair of the 
department," Sarratore said. 

Tbe Communicator contacted Ratliff 
on Ibis issue. 

"I will not discuss personnel issues,' 
Ratliff rebutted. 

The dean appoints the chair in tbe vari 
ous departments of the school. 

Larry Life, associate professor of 
theatre, has been named the chair of tbe 
theatre department

"New Politics of Race" 
Professor lectures on race in U.S. 



by Felicia Becchlng 
News Editor 

Tempers flared and hostility filled the 
tense room Wednesday evening when 
Paul M. Sniderman, political scientist at 
the University of California. Berkeley, 
presented bis research. "The New 



Politi 



i of Roc 



Snidcrman's researchers found that 
they were able to persuade racist and 
non-racist white American altitudes to 
change either positively or negatively 
through persuasion. 

His findings showed that it was easier 
to change a liberal's positive altitude to 
negative, than to change a conserva- 
tive's negative altitude to positive. 
Also, he found that a liberal with nega- 
tive racial attitudes and a conservative 
with positive racial altiludes were the 
hardest lo change of all. 

Sniderman said, "This is good news. 
This time may be tbe only opportunity 
in the last 30 years to possibly change 
people's prejudices." 

Sniderman also said that his research 
through telephone inlcrvicws. showed 
that the more education one receives 
through higher education institutions, 
the more tolerant of African -Americans 
that person will be. 

The audience seemed lo feel olher- 

Members of the audience challenged 
his research findings that education 
mokes a person more racially tolerant. 

"Tbe education institutions foster 
racism by ignoring tbe accomplish- 
ments of African -American sludenis," 
said an African -American student. 

"I never read Black authors or knew 
anything about the contributions of 
African -Americans from school," said a 
white student. 

Two IPFW professors also challenged 
Sniderman when he opened the floor 
for questions. 

'Can you validate your research meth- 
ods and what purpose or usefulness 
your findings prove?" asked a profes- 

Anolhcr professor challenged 
Snidcrman's assertion (hat the institu- 
tions of higher education foster racial 
tolerance. He slated that college stu- 
dents are not required to read about 
minority literature, accomplishments, 
etc. in order to receive a bachelor's 




Paul Sniderman lectures on race 

degree or even a grodualc degree. 
Sniderman became very defensive and 
evasive. He related that his wife is a 
medical school pediatrician specializing 
in premature infant care, 7 out of 10 
babies in her nursery ore minority 
babies. He said that he did not think that 
multicultural education is important 
when compared lo the unnecessarily 
high mortality rale among pre-mature 
minority babies. "We need nalional 
healthcare, not multicultural education." 

Although it appeared thai tbe majority 
of Ibe audience disagreed with 
Sniderman, one woman said, "I agree 



Phola by David StOer 
with tbe professor. He made a lot of 
sense lo mo." 

"I think the aud.cnce was lalking 
apples, and he (SnidermanJ was talking 
oranges." said Richard Johnson, IPFW 
associate professor of modem foreign 
language, and coordinator of peace and 
conflict studies. 

"After the audience challenged him, be 
appeared to go into a defense mode," 
continued Johnson. 

"He [Sniderman] has done some of 
the most respected research in racial 
studies in the last 20 years," said 
Michael Downs, chair of political sci- 
ence, and moderator of tbe program.

Covert racism rears its ugly 
head on campus 



"He also forgets to 
acknowledge the fact 
that because of racist 
attitudes towards peo- 
ple of color, the educa- 
tional institution has 
systematically exclud- 
ed any positive refer- 
ence made to people of 
color " 



"Race may be an issue in the uni- 
versity, but in the real word, it isn't 
an issue," Paul Sniderman, Ihe 
guesi speaker, said lasl Wednesday 
during his lecture on the "New 
Politics of Race." By saying this, 
Sniderman is suggesling that the 
issue of racism has already been 
resolved. So, why arc well-needed 
research funds being spent on 
something that doesn't even exist? 

What Mr. Sniderman confirmed is 
that racism, covert or overt, still 
survives despite the attempts to 
change the condition in which peo- 
ple of color are discriminated in the 
United States. 

Sniderman presented vitaJ infor- 
mation pertaining to while people 
in America. His public opinion 
research showed that 44 percent of 
white Americans can be persuaded 
to change their opinions on several 
issues pertaining to African- 
Americans. 

One must wonder whether 
Sniderman' s research pertains more 
to the principles of persuasion 
rather than the issue everyone else 
who attended the lecture was suited 
to discuss. When Sniderman was 
confronted with a statement from 
(he crowd, rather than actually 
hearing and analyzing what the per- 
son had said, Sniderman was busy 
trying to think of an effective tech- 
nique to persuade that person to 



think otherwise. 

Instead of presenting the informa- 
tion in a positive manner, 
Sniderman concentrated on per- 
suading people to lake "bis" side 
which he never really established 
throughout the entire lecture. 

Unfortunately, Sniderman' s 
research and lecture seems to be a 
prime example of covert racism in 
the educational institution. Here is a 
scholarly man who states that, if 
one is educated, then that person 
will be open-minded as well as 
racially tolerant. 

Yet he fails to realize that people 
of color do not want to be tolerated 
but valued and appreciated for the 
contributions their ancestors have 
made to this society. 

He also forgets to acknowledge 
the fact that because of racist atti- 
tudes towards people of color, the 
educational institution has system- 
atically excluded any positive refer- 
ence made to people of color. 

Why is it possible for college stu- 
dents to attend universities without 
being educated about persons pos- 
sessing differing ethnic back- 
grounds? 

How can he make a statement of 
this magnitude without examining 
his own "ivory" tower? 

This type of covert racism that 
exists within those persons in pow- 
erful positions is often much more 
damaging than any other type of 
racism. When people are ignorant 
of their racist attitudes, this proves 
to be very detrimental to the vic- 
tims of racism. 

From the lecture, it would appear 
to people that Sniderman may suf- 
fer from while man's amnesia. He 
may not have bad a chance to really 
interact with people of color 
besides those of his own socioeco- 
nomic status or educational level. 

If this is the case, maybe 
Sniderman needs to take a course in 
Life 101 and examine the real 
world for what it really is, one 
based on color.

The Insider 



By Sarah Miller 
Acting Managing Editor 

'The Insider" is a new column thai 
will be appearing weekly. 

Il will focus on bringing information 
to you about the faculty and other area 
issoes. 

I'd like to start off (his weeks column 
by praising, and I do mean praising 
those of yoo who took ihe time to write 
a Iciter to the cdiior I am a fum believ- 
er thai if you believe in something that 
you should be willing lo figbi for it. 
Those of you who have showed that 
you believe in something should be 
very proud of yourselves. Kudos lo you 
all. 

But to Ihosc of you out ihcre who are 
sitting by, letting comments simmer in 
Ihc back of your minds, I say, gel off of 
your butts and do something about it, I 
cannot tell you of ilie number of limes 
a member of The Communicator has

won't believe what I heard.... Janice 
said, that Wendy said, Craig said that 
Beth said she thought our article on

jusi couldn't contain herself." 

It seems to me that evidently "Beth" 
could and did contain h'erself because I 
never received a letter to the editor 
about il. It all boils down lo this - if 
you have something to say about The

Letters to the editor 

Student confronts change in department 



Dear Editor. 

I would like to express my concern 
over the recent changes lhat have been 
occurring in the School of Fine and 
Performing Arts. While this campus 
seems relatively small, I think lhat 
many people may be unaware of the 
decisions that arc being made without 
sludcnl input. In my five years here at 
IPFW. I have never been so distraught 
over two administrators as I have been 
with Dean Gerald Ratliff and Vicc- 
Chancellor Michael Wartcll. While both 
of them ore relatively new to mis cam- 
pus, they arc making bold changes 
which I believe (hey do not have Ibe 
knowledge and experience at this cam- 
pus to make. 

The School of Fine and Performing 
Arts has always asked for studenl input 
on their curriculum and faculty. They 
have always (aken that cxlra effort to 
nol only have the basic professor evalu- 
ations at ihc end of the semester, but 
invoke Ihc students by inviting ibem lo 
professor/dean interviews and asking 
them to complete questionnaires after- 
ward and including ihem in Ihe building 



process for each deportment's program 
So it is no surprise that Dean Ratliffs 
decisions seem many students. 

As a theatre student, I was dismayed ai 
Dean Ratliffs capricious decision to 
eliminate our play writing professor 
without any student input. I cannot 
believe, that such a small department 
with less than fifty majors in it would 
concentrate a majority of its faculty in 
one area. Especially after (he long wail 
the students had in getting a play writ- 
ing emphasized professor. Even more 
confusing is the fact that the previous 
professor was emphasized in 
acting/dirccling yel students were [old 
lhai she could not stay because the 
department needed a resident play- 
wright lo guide die play writing majors 
through their emphasis. 

Hoping to sort through the confusion 
Vice-Chancel lor Woitcll agreed lo meet 
with a small committee from the 
Thealre Department. I bad hoped lo 
convince Vice-Chancellor Wartcll that 
we bad valid concerns and were very 
serious aboul our education for which 
we were paying for. However, I knew 
that would not be possible Ihe moment 



he patronizingly told us that "this isn't a 
play. I'm not simply going to realize I 

Chancellor Wartcll at no time did it 
seem like a play to us. Surprised and 
disappointed in him we voiced our con- 
cerns to what, so far. have remained 
deaf cars. He staled mat the thcauc pro- 
gram was nol going to change and that 
Ihe department was just hiring the cor- 
rect faculty member Yet he could not 
explain why the previous professor was 
let go since she fit Ihe profile lhat the 
department supposedly has lo have. He 
also could no explain why Dean Radiff 
would chose to eliminate anyone during 
a department self-siudy or start a search 
to replace thai faculty member when 
Ihcre is no data yc( (o make a competent 
selection. He did reassure us that play 
writing would still be taugbi but by 
farming it out and that we should no! 
feel like our money is being wasted 
because we don't have a faculty mem- 
ber who actually teaches one emphasis 
offered by the department; though it has 
been suggested that if the self study 
reveals that we do indeed need a play 
writing professor than ihey would be 



willing to backtrack and waste universi- 
ty dollars on a costly and time consum- 
ing nationwide search! Explain that! 
Though Vicc-Chanccllor Wartell did 
meet wilh us for about an hour and a 
half il was pointless since he never saw 
us as paying customers, but only naive 
students who need lo be educated. 
Now our long standing department 
chair is suddenly stepping down, stu- 
dents appear neglected and confused, 
and the remaining faculty are inexplica- 
bly mute on subjects where they could 
offer insight. and support. This kind of 
massive shakedown seems to point 
directly at ihc ill-timed over zealous- 
ncss of middle management. It seems 
quite ironic thai a new building with 
new opportunities has recently been 
dedicated lo the Theatre Deportment, as 
the control of lhat department quickly 
slips away from its students and faculty 
and into the bands of malevolent central 
power. Some may call (his efficiency 
and professionalism; others no doubt 
will see it as simple fascism. 



Professor writes in support of Taylor 



Dear Ms. Beeching. 

I am writing in response to your article 
concerning Dr. John Taylor, newly 
appointed chair of the Music 
Department at IUPU Fort Wayne. It 
was my pleasure (o be associated with 
Dr. Taylor while he was chair of (he 
Department of Music and Art here at 
Tennessee Tech and I can say without 
hesitation lhat he is the best chair for 
• whom I have ever worked and one of 
(he kindest and most gentle humans I 
have ever know. It simply is nol in his 
nature lo harass, certainly a port of bis 
job is to challenge people lo do their 

harassing another human being. 
My opinion of Dr. Taylor's tenure 
here is summed up in portions of a let- 
ter which I wrote last spring concerning 
Dr. Taylor and the support he bad 
shown me during a particularly busy 
time of Ihe semester. 
'To: Dr. Angelo Volpe, President 
Tennessee Technological University 
I'm telling you all of this to say lhat 
Ihe atmosphere that allowed alt this to 



happen was created by one man. Dr. 
John Taylor. He is quite simply the best 
department chair for whom I have ever 
worked In the four years since be came 
here, our morale and productivity have 
increased many fold. For example, four 
years, three years and probably even 
one year ago, we could not have done 
the Brahms "Requiem". There would 
have been no administrative support lo 
put the project together other than lip 
service Dr Taylor has changed lhat. He 
has given the vocal area the support and 
the nudge we needed lo move us from a 
Status quo portion of the department to 
the point where we have sung for two 
stale and one eleven-stale regional 
meeting in the past three years. People 
now ask me at professional meetings 
when Ihey ore going to be able to hear 
die Tech Chorale again. 
Also, the number of vocal majors has 
grown more than proportionately with 
Ihc number in the rest of the depart- 
ment. There arc now about thirty voice 
majors and well over 140 people who 
participate in choral and vocal music on 
our campus compared to ten and eighty 



respectively in 1989. Probably, this 

level of participation has always been 
possible, but, in fact, there had never 
been an administrator who was willing 
to give the person in my position Ibe 
wherewithal lo pursue excellence in this 
area. Dr. Taylor has. He has led to 
demand more ourselves than we knew 
we could give. Our productivity is up. 
Our morale is higher lhan it ever has 
been in eleven years here. Given the 
kinds of things described above the 
expectalions we have for the future. 
there is no reason thai TTU can't come 
even closer lo Ihe goal of being the 
place lo be for choral music in the stale 
of Tennessee. Being the best in the 
slate and region is a very real and 
attainable goal in music as it is in prac- 
tically no other endeavor on campus. 
We probably can't win athletic events 
with the UT's or the Georgia Tech's 
with any regularity- but our choirs and 
our bands do it with impunity-and wilh 
budgets lhai have of necessity, been 
gulled in the past three years. Imagine 
the possibilities for the future wilh Dr. 
Taylor at the helm and the department 



given the budgetary and moral support 
lo really realize our potential. 
Everybody wins., ihe university, the 
community, the region and, most 
importantly, our students have been 
given the very best we can give them. 
They deserve no less. 

Thank you for your lime support and 
consideration." 

In my view, those who have accused 
him of various acts of harassment are 
Ihosc among my colleagues (present 
and former) who are not willing to pull 
their own weight in the department and 
ore hiding behind the current litigious 
nature of our society to avoid doing 
Ibeir job. The majonly of Ihe people in 
our department were very sorry to see 
Dr. Taylor leave here and wish him 
well al IUPU.

"I would consider gossip 
to be a little more infor- 
mation like, 'Yeah, your 
cousin, she's nice and all ... 
but I hear she gets 
around.'" 



Well, 1 am back from a little v 

You know. I have got some gossip this 
week. It's a blind ilem because I ain't 
one lo talk about no one. Anyway, 
somebody whom we all know and love 
has begun lo make lhai change with 
Weigh! Watchers. 

Can you guess? 
And I will just leave il al dial. 

By Ihe way, I mink we need to define 
whal I mean by gossip. According lo 
Mr. Webster, gossip is defined as a 
rumor or report of an inlimale nolurc. 
Now. I lake ibal just a lilUc bit further 
by describing the levels of gossip. 

The fust is a tidbit. A tidbit is trivial 
information. For instance, if you know 



You didn't hear it from me, but... 

somebody's cousin and you say. "Hey, Now. what people have to know is that 
yeah, I know your cousin. She's pretty to be a true gossip you must be able to 
You know ... irrelevant stuff back track and trace die history of peo- 
n'l work with dial but it is esscn- pic and all. Thai shows lhat you have 
:rsatiliiy, which 
important. 




You know, il hits a 
litde bit deeper. 
The final catego- 
ry is "sip. Sip is 
when you have Ihc 
details of who did 






a nutshell 



Irue attribute of a 
gossip is knowing 
when lo shut up and 
when not to. 
i need lo know if 
iludcnt. a lol of 



activities are taking place in Ihe School 
of Fine Arts. Certain people have been 
fired and others have resigned. If you 
don't know what I'm talking about. I 
ihink you need lo read ihc front page. 

Not only would I look at the School of 
Fine Arts, but I would predict Ihcre will 
be some cleaning house all over this 
campus, say . starting with the school of 
Education! And I will just leave il at 
that. 

Ob, and this a personal note that I 
think all of you would love to know... I 
was recently honored in an underground 
newspaper, Ihc 'Guish. They look the 
lime lo give me one third of Ihcir one 
page newsletter. I didn't realize the 
publishers of this "paper" would con- 
sider me such a high-profile person on 
campus by soluUng me with o parody of 
my article entitled, "I don't really have 
anything lo say, but..." It must have 
laken a long lime lo read my articles 
and emulate my work.

The child care referral service obvi-

a child going to have to be hurt or lost 
before anyone feels like any practical 
solutions can be implemented?

The department of English and

Alice Friman on the IPFW campus last 
Thursday with a free, public reading

Friman was recently named "Teacher 
of the Year." Her visit has been made 
possible with the support of the Indiana 
Arts Commission and the National 
Endowment for the Arts. 

Participation in the workshop was 
based on acceptance of three poems that

Potential writers submitted their manu- 
scripts for the workshop and ten were 
selected. Participants in the workshop 
include Shcilah Bower. Jeanne Blum,

Wendell Mayo, assistant professor of 
English met Frima*h in the Spring of 
1993 at Michigan State and has a very 
high opinion of Friman. 

"Sbe captivates her audience and is 
one of the best readers I have ever 
seen," said Mayo. The nice thing about 
poetry is that it [ends' itself to perfor- 
mance and interpretation. 

"Alice is a very well-known poet in 
Indiana, and is easily recognizable 
because she speaks with great compas- 
sion." added Mayo. She is a very con- 
temporary poet that writes about bow

By Jo Ann Slelnfohh 
Features Editor 

The Allen County Christmas Bureau

Jane Surbeck. secretary for the orga- 
nization, reports that 200 families 
have been adopted already and that 
the goal for the year is 382. 

Families are referred through Social 
Service Agency, the AIDS Task 
Force, and Big Brothers and Big 

"There arc two different types of 
programs, the Adoptive Program and 
the Shopping Site," said Surbeck 

The Shopping Site allows individu- 
als to sign up and make their own 
selection of clothing, toys and small 
household items. The individuals that 
go through the Shopping Site receive 
their shopping date and lime to pick 
up a Christmas turkey or bam, potato, 
and stuffing. 

"Some schools and churches lake up 
a collection for personal hygiene, 
things that food stamps won't pay 
for," added Surbeck. 

Last year the Indiana University 
Credit Union adopted a family. 

Donations of toys, clothing, small 
household items, blankets, sheets, 
towels, etc., either new or use items

Design 

Students design special room

By Jo Ann Stelntorih 
Features Editor 

Students of the IPFW Interior Design 
Program attended the Interior Design 
Showcase at the Allen County War 
Memorial Coliseum held October 
22-24 

The students had a 10 x 10 booth and 
spoke to the public about the design 
program. 

John L. Vollmer, assistant professor of 
the Interior Design Program was the 
faculty advisor that was invited to 
design a room al the Coliseum. 

The Inlcrior Design Program program 
statement is as follows: 

"The plan called for a bedroom for 
two children, ages 4 to 10, with one 
child having an ambulatory disability. 

The focus of the room is to answer 
bolh the parent's and children's differ- 
ing needs for a dynamic space and fin- 
ishes that accommodate particular func- 
tions and spatial requirements with a 
sense of economy and case of mainte- 
nance so important to the balance of 
family and home life." 

"I wanted to show a room that was 
both different and useful to the commu- 
nity 10 draw attention, and to bring 
of the disabled." 



said Vollmer. 

"We designed a child's bedroom for 
two children, one with a moderate dis- 
ability," added Vollmer. 

The Americans with Disability Act 
was passed and went into effect in 
1992, the purpose was to better accom- 
modate facilities in public facilities. 

"In the past, public facilities had not 
accommodate the handicapped," said 
Vollmer. 

The ADA now slates that anytime a 
public building is renovated, the facili- 
ties must also install wider doorways 
for wheelchairs. In addition, each floor 
must have a handicapped toilet. 

"For the child's room that we 
designed, we focused on materials such 
as carpet tiles that arc low pile (as 
opposed to plush) so toys and wheel- 
chairs roll easier," explained Vollmer. 

Using carpet tiles enabled us to create 
a different design, creating a palh going 
through the rooms. 

This use -of carpet tiles allows the par- 
ent to replace any tile easily when a 
portion of the carpet has been soiled. 

"You can replace one square or a num- 
ber of squares, without replacing the 
entire room," said Vollmer. 

To prepare himself for this design 
shrtw. Vollmer relied on his past expert- 



met May through October. 
Students assisting Vollmer in this pro- 
ject were Sonya Agarmonte, Joy 
Harger, Shelley Pullver. Kim 

Hitchcock, and Lee Hanford. 

Their research took them to "Rimstone 
Center for Disabled Children and 

Adults. They surveyed kindergarten 
teachers and asked elementary children 
what they thought were the needs of the 
disabled. 

The best source for research on this 
project were the families of the disabled 
children themselves. 

"Since there are different degrees of 
disabilities, the focus of this design 
show was to show an ei 
people can do for Ibet 
explained Vollmer. 



"We 



sign a bed 



where a child could get into it easily, 
wilh a step installed where a child could 
climb into the bed and pull themselves 
up." said Vollmer. 

"It's important that a wheelchair can 
fit under desks and tables, our goal is to 
look for simple, economical approaches 
to accommodate these needs," added 
Vollmer.

Aunt Louise addresses

Dear Aunl Louise, 



I know you arc the only person in this 
world thai can help me with my prob- 
lem. I livr with several people in a four 
bedroom house: one couple, anolhcr 
femnlc roommate, and myself 



We i

I trie 









However, there is b big problem • 
Ihe Jiving arrangement. The coup] 
always active at night. And w 
and the other roommate) are 
tired of listening lo people ! 
bearing somebody's head hit s 

We're losing sleep. 

We have hinted around to ihcm that 
they are a bit vocal, however, they 
haven't received the hint! What should 
we do? 

Tired of all 

Screaming 

Dear Tired of all the Pounding and 
Screaming, 

The first thing you need lo do is call a 
meeting and inform them of it directly, 
instead of merely alluding lo it. You 
need to speak up for your rights. Now, 
if these frisky little creatures don't take 



your request for silence at night to 
heart, then I suggest you bang on tbe 
door right when tbe bunnies arc busy 
and tell them to quiet down. 

If that won't spoil Ihe moment, then I 
don't know what will! 

Your loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunl Louise, 

What do I do? I am in a big dilemma. I 
am in love with my professor. I know 
he doesn't know that 1 even exist! 
Whenever I see him. I just melt inside. I 
can't say anything. I just can't func- 
tion. I would really like lo lei him know 
how I feel personally, but I don't know 
how he would respond. What should I 
do? 

Deep in love 

Dear Deep in Love, 

Darlin', I suggest you come down lo 
reality. Most people on campus are 
really are against professors and stu- 
dating because of ethical con- 



;he Pounding and 



If I were you. I would just wipe that 
little Ihought out of your mind. Now, I 
am no psychologist, but I think what 
you need to do is wash this man right 
out of your mind. So I believe, sugar, 
the best thing lo do would be to write 
down all of your feelings about him 
everyday, until you have nothing else 
left inside. 

This will be painful and Ihe [ears will 
fall. I suggest you go to Target or 
K-Marl and buy Puffs Plus because

Mark Fore Classic 



Aaron N. Thompson 
Sports Editor 



lhal Features confer- 
ence foes lhat bave beaten you in pre- 
vious matches, it might be necessary to 
get a Utile worried. 

However, if you arc Tim Heffron's 
IPFW Lady Volleydons, you unleash 
your "Lyon" and your worries are 

That is what occurred lost Friday at 
Hilliard Gales Alhlelic Center, Jill 
Lyon, the Volleydons 1 season assist 
leader, had 152 assists and garnered 
the Most Valuable Player award in 
IPFW-s 4-0 sweep of the Mark 
Fore/IPFW Classic. 

Lyon is not the only player on the 
team malting noise. As a mailer of fact, 
the entire learn is on a roll. The 
Volleydons bave now won 10 straight 
contests and 19 out of the last 21 over- 
all. I he four victories in the tourna- 
ment improved their record to 22-15. 

The firs! match in the tournament pil- 
led the Volleydons against conference 
foe Northern Kentucky (NK) who 
boasted their 24-8 record. This was a 
chance for vengeance by IPFW, as 
they dropped a 1-3 decision NK earlier 



Ibis

stfor 



battle, and when the dust cleared, the 
result was a convincing 3-1 victory for 
the Volleydons. 

In the first and second games, the 
Volleydons hammered NK. healing 
(hem 30-10 collectively. The third 
game, usually the "let-down" game 
thus far this season, was won 15-4 by 
NK. The Volleydons then regrouped 
and took tbe match by winning the 
fourth game in convincing fashion. 
The Tina! line on Ibis match was 15-7,

way wilb 20 digs and four blocks. 
Scheumann followed with 12 digs and 
Amy Polvado bad Ihrce blocks. As a 
team. Ihe Volleydons bad 66 digs and 
11 blocks. 

This viciory improved IPFW's record 
to 19-15 overall and dropped Northern 
Kentucky to 24-9. 

Next up was Grand Valley Slate 
University (GVSU). Tbe Volleydons 
went right to work in this one. winning 
the first two games, including a tie- 
breaker in tbe second, and avoided the 

let-down" game by crashing GVSU 

n tbe third. The final line on this one 
was .15-11, 16-14, 15-3 and a 3-0 

Teagarden once again led die team in 
kills, knocking down 17. Parrot was 
next with eight kills, and also had three 
ice aces. Jill Lyon followed the 
traditional pattern as she led the team 
witb 31 assists. As a team. Ihe 
Volleydons had 46 kills on 106 
attempts and bad six service aces. 

Teagarden was all over the court as 
;he lead the team witb 11 digs and 
Lyon had nine. Baer countered GVSU 
witb four blocks, followed by 
Scheumann with three. As a team, the 
Volleydons registered 44 digs and 
denied GVSU with 10 blocks 

This continued the victorious roll by 
IPFW, as Ibey once again improved 
their record to 20-15. and sent GVSU 
reeling and dropped their record to 15- 
13. 

Then the team from Ashland, who 
finished number one in the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference this : 

: in to lake revenge against Ihe 



Volleydons The last meeting bet' 
these teams featured a grueling 3-2 
victory for IPFW. 

Ashland came out with all pistons fir- 
ing as tbey blasted by the Volleydons 
15-13. Bui, with bundles of help from 
IPFW, Ashland's motor start* 
sputter. IPFW look Ihe ncxl I 
games in convincing fashion, out 
ing Ashland 45-18 collectively. The 
final line in this one shows IPFW's 
viclory. 13-15, 15-5, 15-9, 154. 

Teagarden once again led the team in 
kills, smacking 17 out of 40 aiicmpts.

Tbe viclory kept the Volleydon; 
rolling toward the tournament champi- 
onship as they improved their record to 
21-15. Tbe loss dropped Ashland to an 
18-8 record. 

In order to capture the Classic, how- 
ever, the Volleydons needed to defeat 
the team from Nortbwood to give them 
an unblemished record in the tourna- 

At first, it appeared that Nortbwood 
was going to give IPFW a run for the 
money as it took tbe first game 16-1 
The Volleydons then recuperated and 
won the next two games fairly handily, 
15-10 and 15-4. The last game, with 
the undefeated record within a game'; 
reach, was a real struggle. Both team: 
took turns exchanging points and when 
all was said and done, tbe Volleydi 
stood atone triumphant with a 16-14 

Teagarden and Baer ran the offensive 
charge by garnering 19 and 14 kills 
respectively. Parrot also made her 
presence known as sbe hit 12 kills and 
four service aces. Lyon capped her 
MVP tournament with a sparkling 50 
assist performance. IPFW finished the 
match with 63 kills. 50 assists and 13 

On the defensive front, Parrot and 
Baer led tbe way with 16 and 12 digs 
respectively, Polvado was lough on the 
net as sbe denied the opposition five 
times wilh five blocks. Overall, the 
Volleydons bad 65 digs and 10 blocks. 

Tbe victory plus tbe tournament 
championship brings the Volleydon 
record to where it stands now, 22-15. 
Tbe loss by Northwood drops tbeir 
record to 12-16.

Playing a 'role' 
isn't easy 



Aaron N. Thompson 
Sports Editor 

I don't know exactly where the dis- 
pute started, but 1 know that when 
Charles Barkley did bis Nike advertise- 
ment and said. "I am not a role model." 
he added fuel to tbe fur. What Barkley 
said may he somewhat true, but not 
absolutely. 

When an individual outside of the 
game of basketball watches Barkley 
perform, they always pick out the nega- 
tive things about bim. Of course, 
Barkley does nothing to hide his nega- 
tive comments and aclions. For exam- 
ple, what parent wants their kid watch- 
ing a professional basketball player spit 
on a fan? Another example of 
Barkley's nonchalant rebellion against 
the norm took place in last year's finals 
against the Chicago Bulls. A fan, seated 
behind the Suns' bench, continued to 
harass Barkley about a missed free 
ihrow. Barkley, in front of the camera 
while the whale world was watching, 
said something to Ihe effect of "Go 
f— yourself!" and pointed at the fan. 

These negative aspects arc very diffi- 
cult to overlook, but tbey are over- 
looked because Barkley is a proven 

rebounds ferociously and is a solid 
presence in the NBA. In fact, it has 
been said that because Michael Jordan 
retired, Barkley may very well be the 
best player in Ihe NBA He was also 
the League's Most Valuable Player last 

If one were to look at tbe total pack- 
age of Charles Barkley, tbey would 
agree that he does not make an excel- 
lent role model But, if one was to look 
at Barkley as just a hall player, then be 
might be the best there is. 

So, sony Charlie. You ARE a role 
mode). And as long as you play basket- 
ball and arc good at it, you will contin- 
ue to be a role model, whether you like 

In Ihe laws of human nature, it is said 
lhat everyone has good qualities and 
bad qualities. Some individuals' good 
qualities are more prevalent and obvi- 

But wben choosing a role model, we 
are selecting an individual thai best 
matches our own personality. For 
example, in basketball, if someone 
chooses Charles Barkley to be their 
particular role model, then that person 
likes being "tbe bad guy " However, if 
a person chooses an individual like 
Magic Johnson, then be probably likes 
being "the good guy." 

Where it all starts, though, is at home. 
Barkley is right when be said tbat tbe 
parents of these kids should be their 
role models, Parenls play the biggest 
part in who their kids select as role 
models. If the parent has done his/her 
job and instituted good values into their 
children, then cbanccs arc. the child 
will either select their parenls as their 
role models or someone "positive." 

Tbe selection of Barkley as a role 
model, contrary to popular belief 
(including Barkley's) may not be a bad 
choice if it is viewed in the proper con- 
text. 

Firstly. Barkley overcame poverty lo 
become a millionaire playing basket- 
ball. Secondly, be has overcome bis 
own physical limitations in order to 
become the best be can possibly be. He 
is only 6'4" and plays forward, which 
makes him small for his posilion. He 
compensates for Ihis with his well- 



trained strength and excellent vertical 
leap — a leap that be attained by jump- 
ing continuously over a fence that very 
nearly ripped off his private parts a few 
times. He worked hard and made him- 
self tbe besl be could be. 

It a parents see their sons or daughters 
following Barkley's footsteps in Ihis 
manner, then wilh the proper guidance, 
Barkley's influence can be a very posi- 

However, the first time that Junior 
spits on a fan, or a leammatc during a 
basketball game, it is up to the parents 
to reprimand the child The blame 
should not be put on Barkley. It is total- 
ly tbe parent/s and the morals thai they 
bave been instilling in the child since 
birth. 

Even though a person has a role 
model, whose personality [hey follow 
to a "T," one is responsible for one's 
own actions. 

For example, if my role model was 
Charles Barkley. I would not spit on a 
fan just- because Barkley did it. My par- 
enls taught me belter than lhat. You 
simply cannot lake an athletic role 
model to the point of obsession. 

Whenever a person - especially an 
athlete, is in the public eye. there is a 
good chance lhat person will be a role 
model to someone, somewhere. 

Role models are often chosen for 
other reasons than success, even though 
success definitely plays a big part 
Sometimes role models are chosen 
because of tbe way that they conduct 
themselves, or Ibe amount of desire 
they have in a losing effort. 

Maybe they are chosen merely on ibe 
amount of talent that they have. 
Whatever the reason may be. it is not 
the choice of the role model to be a role 
model. 

So when I bear a parenl screaming, 
"My kid would be better if he didn't 
idolize that darn Charles Barkley," 1 
only see a parent that is shifting blame 



Tbe 






"role model" docs not neces- 
sarily mean, "sole" model. More than 
one person often influences the person- 
ality of an individual. For example, a 
child may have their parents as their 
role models because of the love and the 
strength thai a family creates, and idol- 
ize Charles Barkley for what he has 
accomplished and his talent 

So parents, if you want to blame 
someone for something your child has 
done wrong, you had better take a good 
look at yourself before you open your 
mouth and stick your foot in ii. It is 
your responsibility lo lead your child 
along the right path in life. 

Finally, to future role models, and I 
know there are a lot of you out there, be 
careful of what you do and bow you 
conduct yourself. If parents continue to 
not do their jobs, then you may be indi- 
rectly responsible for tbe actions of a 
generation of children.

Q: Which lubricants

A: Water-based 
lubricants— such as KY 
Jelly and Astroglide— are 
the only ones that are 
safe. Do NOT use oil- 
based lubricants—such 
as vaseline, cooking oil, 
or hand lotion— as these

likely to break.

Life was to assume Che positioD of act-

sabbatical, for the 1994 Spring semes- 
According to Sarratore, the dean did 
hold meetings open to the students to 
discuss the LaButc situation. 
The Communicator questioned 
Sarratore on how he felt about the dcci- 

"It's a personnel matter. I did iccom- 
mend thai he be reappointed," he added. 
However, students still have responded 



negatively to the decision. 

"I don't like the way that he (Ratliff] 
is doing things. He is doing things 
behind the backs of everyone," IPFW 
student Tim Amos said. 

"He came in wilh ideas and things to 
do. that didn't matter what school he 
was going to, he would implement it in 
any school he came lo," Amos added. 

Cray echoed the same emotions. 

"He has to realize that we as students 
will pull logeihcr and take action. We 
arc not going lo let him put this tension 
in our department and block our rela- 
tionships that we have with our teach- 
ers," Cray said. 

As far as changing the decision due to 
student input, Sarratore has yet tp see 
student input reverse a decision made 
by a dean. 

After a dean makes any type of deci- 
sion, be or she presents it lo the vice- 
chancellor of academic affairs and then

"I'm not sure that we'll be able to

appeared in the November 4 issue of the

eggshells, ibis person may have an 
avoiding altitude toward handling con- 
flict. 

People who have no conirol over 
meetings generally lend lo handle con- 
flict by being accommodating. They let 
everyone have their way. However 
those who arc not accommodating 
appear not to be liked or appreciated. 

Zimmerman went on lo confirm that 
nol everyone is totally comprised of all 
these modes, but Ihey must have a

even realize it," summed up one IPFW 
African-American student. "In his 
position, that's scary."
