Student budgets 
being considered 



\i\ lOMMYFRANKE 



for the 1974-5 year are under 
consideration by the Bureau of the 
Budget. 

The bureau, which consists of 
students John Gerber, treasurer of 
the student body; Roland Clemens, 
chairman of the Student Senate's 
Appropriations Committee; and Bill 
Elwood, a presidential appointee, will 



The Senate 
makes all final decisions regarding 
allocations. 

Gerber explained why the alloca- 
tions system is set up in this manner, 
"The Senate receives the budget in a 
capsulized form. It would be 
extremely tedious for them to have to 
wade through all the paperwork of 
each budget." 

He then explained that out of 
every §15 activity fee, $10 goes to 
student organizations and $5 goes to 
athletics. 

The bureau, the allocations 
committee, and finally, the Senate, 
decide on how the $10 part of each 
activity fee is spent. 

Gerber commented, "I think this 
will be an austerity budget. We've had 
i deplete the reserves to quite ; 



Purdue Manual for the administra- 
tion of activity and athletic fee funds. 
Explaining that since Purdue 
handles all of the activity fee money, 
"If we don't follow the manual, we 
could have budgets backed up until 



According to the manual, the 
groups that are "cultural, recreation- 
al, and informal activities which 
contribute to a well-rounded student 
life" are eligible for activity fee 
support. Also, athletic fees are 
assessed for Ihe purpose of supporting 
intramural and intercollegiate pro- 
Special interests groups are 
eligible for a one-time startup 
allocation. 

Groups that are not eligible are 
selective membership organizations. 
According to Gerber, the Senate 
has already earmarked $10,000 of next 
year's allocations to go for the 
building of tennis courts on campus. 
Other budgets to be given high 
priority are the child care center, the 
Student Union Board, and the 

Other organizations that have 
been funded in the past are the 
Convocations Committee, Purdue-In- 
diana Theatre, the Film Series 
Committee, the Debate Club, Impres- 
sions magazine, and the University 
Singers. 

The bureau will consider the 
budgets, and then set up hearings to 
discuss and review the budgets with 
the organizations. 

According to Gerber, the bureau 
will make one of three final decisions 
on each budget : 1) they should 
receive the full amount they request- 
ed; 2) they should receive a lesser 
amount than they requested; or 3) 
they should not be funded. 

The bureau will finish their 
considerations by March 29; then the 
approved budgets will go on to the 
appropriations committee. 

Any organization that would like 
to be considered for funding, should

WPTH to go rock stereo 



Radio station WPTH Stereo FM 
will be Fort Wayne's first rock FM 
station, in the very near future. 
WPTH will start playing rock and 
drop their easy listening format. 

The change has been coming for 
several months, but the actual 
finalizing of the switch-over has been 
abrupt. According to a source close to 
the station, the change was influenced 



2 claimed to be the 
main reason for the change. 

WPTH feels that Fort Wayne is 
ready for a rock FM station and that 
the station is ready to offer it. A 
reliable source says that the change 
can't hurt and hopes that it will help. 

PTH is looking for an increase in 
sales and listenership. A consultant 
firm is working with WPTH. 

The source also said that WPTH 
has investigated thoroughly the 
effects of a change-over and believe 
that the change will be fruitful. 

WPTH refers to its music as adult 
rock. Adult rock was defined by, 
"rock music without bubble gum and 
the so-called acid types." Their music 
will consist of fast paced rock, such as 
Led Zepplin, to much softer sounds. 
They believe this type of music is the 



WPTH's emphasis will be on the 
music rather than the disc jockey, 
stating, "50 to 55 min. out of an hour 
will be music. 

The source stated "there will be 
no contest, no screaming D.J.s. The 
station will try to appeal to the serious 



music listener who wants to hear 
music." Part of WPTH's format will 
consist of oldies from 1958 oh, with the 
main emphasis on the most current 
four years. 

WPTH stated, "The music will be 
extremely current. We will often by 
playing songs that no one has heard in 
Fort Wayne." A reliable source 
believes that the listener will accept 
the newest songs rather than reject 
them as other stations believe. 

The morning shift will be geared 
to the teenagers, while the rest of the 
day will be geared to the 18 to 34 
listeners. 

The news department will have a 
major change. According to a reliable 
WPTH is going to do away 



t the bottom of the hour. 
The news will consist of short and 
precise information about the import- 
ant events of the day." 

The WPTH news will use a 
positive attitude in the news. 
According to the source, "It is not 
necessary to clutter the news with 
gorey details." He also stated that 
"We are cutting the news, but we 
don't want the listener to feel 
uninformed. We just don't want to 
insult the intelligence of ur listeners 
with alot of sensationalism." 

The news will consist of world, 
national, state and local coverage.

going to improve the sound quality of 




Indiana Faculty 
Senate threatens 
work stoppage 



resolution concerning faculty salaries 
and alert the University that, "The 
possibility &lt;ii faculty work stoppages 
at this University is now imminent." 
The resolution now goes to a vote of 
the entire faculty. 

Pointed out in the resolution are 
the faculty's feelings that its 
increments have failed to keep pace 
with the cost of living and are behind 
the raises given to other university 
faculties. The document then calls lor 
a minimum acceptable increase 
equal to the Consumer Price Index 
increase for 1973, an estimated 9.2 per 
cent as opposed to the 5.5 per cent now 
bring offered bv the University. 

The faculty blames the IU 
administration and says that recent 
attitudes displayed by the University 
are based on immaterial and 
Irrelevant attempts to " 'justify' 
increments because of the 'relation- 
ship of the University to the 
Legislature,' budget deficiencies or 
whatever. Faculty sources emphasiz- 
ed that the work stoppage would not 
include leaving Ihe classrooms. 

Sources close to the Senate 
pointed out in an interview that 
instructors in the Fort Wayne 
Community Schools will request a 
higher increment than that received 
by the faculty here. In addition, the 
FWCS teachers have cost of living 
increases included in their contracts, 
which the IU people do not. One 
instructor noted that he could be 
making an extra $2-3,000 if he left the 
University for a school system. 

While there is no official word 
from either the American Federation 



(AAUP), it was noted that officials of 
both organizations had signed a 
petition circulated earlier containing 
the same basic demands as the 
resolution. 

According to Purdue Senate 
sources, there are no known plans to 
submit a companion resolution to that 
body, although an interest in seeing 
the resolution was expressed by 
faculty sources. 

There was no comment available 
today from the IU Fort Wayne 
administration as Ralph E. BroyleS, 
Chancellor, was out of town, and 
Richard L. Desmond, dean of faculty, 
had not received a copy of the

AFT has year to work out 
proposals for IU-PU merger 






By REX PUTT 



American Federation of Teachers 
endorses "the continued activity of 
the Ad Hoc Joint Faculty Steering 
Committee to make best use of the 
delay time to give a strong faculty 
voice when the merger actually 

The conflict between certain 
courses and programs (with regard to 
the faculty) have caused many 
problems for the students. A 
combined administration and faculty 
would alleviate this problem, accord- 
ing to Gottlieb. 

Gottlieb also indicated that there 
is much money being wasted with the 
existence of two of everything. He 
sees no reason for the University to 
have two business offices and two 
deanships, among other things. 

"However," Gottlieb stated, "I 
personally like the idea we have of 
being tied to one or another of the 
main campuses, but not the type of 
relationship where it strangles us." 

He added, "I think it is important 
for most students to receive a diploma 
from a 'Big Ten School,' and the 
connection is also important for 
attracting good faculty." 

This was the recommendation of 
Sheldon Gottlieb, president of the 
AFT chapter in Fort Wayne (and 
several other AFT members* to be 
presented to the AFT chapter, so that 
it might be passed on to the Ad Hoc 
Joint Faculty Steering Committee. 



72% of Americans 
suffer migraines 

Migraine isn't "justa headache," 
the authors of the recently published 
"Headache Book" point out, but may 
involve the eyes, nose, gastrointestin- 
al tract or urinary system. 

Some 5 to 12 per cent of the U. S. 
population suffers from migraine, 
says Arnold P. Friedman, M.D., 
internationally renowned authority on 
treatment of headaches and Shervert 
H. Frazier, Jr., M.D., psychiatrist, 
who teamed up on the book with 



John W. Ryan, president of Indiana 
University, visited Indiana-Purdue at 
Fort Wayne. 

In announcing the postponement 
of merger attempts, they implied that 
the campus in Fort Wayne will retain 
its dual nature. 

There will continue to be two 
budgets, two sets of accounting 
procedures, two degrees, two curri- 
cula, and two faculties. 

A bill that would have helped to 
establish unification efforts was 
dropped in the General Assembly. 
The legislators claimed the provision 
was dropped so that a special General 
Assembly task force would have the 
opportunity to study the needs of 
higher education without any reslrie- 

In response to the presidents' 
decision, Gottlieb stated, "It is 



Although there is no clear 
mandate, Gottlieb stressed the fact 
that the faculty continues to work in 
its efforts to unite the administra- 
tions. He hopes that viewing the 
reality of the present administration, 
the faculty will be able to face the 
issue of merger. 

The American Association of 
University Professors originally had 
a Purdue chapter and an Indiana 
chapter at Fort Wayne; whereas the 
AFT was initially arranged so that the 



One AFT source claimed that it 
was their actions that helped press 
the AAUP into their recent merger, 

"The AFT," said Gottlieb, "is one 



single faculty working for merger. We 
think as one, and act as one for better 
growth of the University." 

He emphasized that the students 
should assist the faculty in forcing the 
issue of merger. He noted that the 
students are the ones that are cheated 
in the present structure. 

Gottlieb strongly feels that the 
students are the ones that suffer 
because of the two separate faculties. 
He cited counseling as a major 
problem, using his biology depart- 
ment as an example. The Indiana 
biology students are at a disadvan- 
tage because there is no Indiana 
faculty to counsel them. 

He also added that the communi- 
ty would benefit from the merger of 
the faculties, administrations, and 
business offices.

Speaking 



MONEY MATTERS 



Sam Rea on IU-PU 



Samuel Rea, former chairman of the Indiana House Ways and Means 
Committee and presently a member of the Indiana Commission for 
Higher Education (HEC), recently spoke to the Fort Wayne Quest Club 
regarding the future of Indiana-Purdue. The text of his speech was 
printed in last Sunday's Journal-Gazette. 

Rea made some astute observations about the regional campus 
student. He also showed a good underslanding of why the regional 



campuses have flourished t 
campuses. 

Rea then went on to disci 
The first was total independei 
aid thai independence for i 



i of hardship for the residential 



ss three governance proposals for IU-PU. 
ce from the I.U. and Purdue systems. He 
i could lead to independence for others, 
causing a state-wide board of regents type of government. He also feared 
that the birth pains of independence might not be worth it. 

Rea's second alternative was pretty much the status quo: two 
separate universities operating on the same campus and sharing only 
those functions that are necessary. 

His third proposal was somewhat of a combination of the first two. 
IU-PU would retain its name and ties with the parent institutions. Yet the 
campus would be merged into one university, one academic program, 
and operated by either I.U. or Purdue. 

The most favored alternative, at least the one most favored by 
campus constituencies, Rea does not discuss. This would completely 
merge I.U. and Purdue into one university and one academic program, 
much like Rea proposed in number three above. However, neither main 
campus would exercise iot;i) administrative control over the Fort Wayne 
Campus. 

This proposal would give IU-PU independence from day-to-day 
interference from Bloomingtnn and Lafayette; yet it would not sever all 
ties to I.U. and Purdue. 

This is exactly what most of the IU-PU family was fooled into 
believing would happen under the new super-chancellor. But as it turned 
out, the two presidents played IU-PU for the sucker one more time. 

Mr. Rea should look into this fourth alternative more closely. 
Proposal four is the only thing that will be accepted here short of total 
independence, at least given the track record of treatment given IU-PU 
by the main campuses. 

The recent disclosures by Messrs. Ryan and Hansen are proof that 
IU-PU had better be ready for more of the same. 



Admissions quotas 



The Supreme Court is finally looking into the issue of quotas, 
especially as they apply to graduate school admissions. The High Court 
has accepted the ease of Marco DeFunis who was denied admission to the 
University of Washington law school. 

Mr. DeFunis charges that 74 applicants with predicted averages 
lower than his were admitted. The predicted average is computed from 
the applicant's junior and senior college grades and his score on the law 
school admission test. 

Mr. DeFunis charges that 36 of the 74 were admitted over him 
specifically because they were of minority groups. Mr. DeFunis, 
ironically, is Jewish. 

His case against the U. of Washington is based on the Equal 
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and federal civil rights 

The case will be a showdown between two popular opinions. One says 
that minorities who have been discriminated against in the past should 
receive preferential treatment now to make up for the past wrongs. The 
other says that everyone should be judged solely on his own merit. 

According to a brief filed by Harvard University in support of the 
University of Washington, the correct interpretation of the Equal 
Protection Clause prohibits racially-conscious government activity only 
when that activity is "hostile or invidious toward minorities." 

The Supreme Court will ultimately have to decide whether the Equal 
Protection Clause applies uniformly to all or especially to minorities. 

Should the Court rule in favor of Mr. DeFunis, graduate schools 
everywhere will be forced to make substantia! changes in their 
admissions policies. 

Whether this is for the good or the bad, only the Supreme Court 
knows, and it has finally decided to tell us.

Student apathy hit an all-time 
high last Friday when it was an- 
nounced that Some Concordia High 
School Teenyboppers were going to be 
the first to streak our campus They 



Not too many years ago the 
Studebaker plant in South Bend 
announced that it was ceasing 
operation. Thousands of men and 
women were thrown out of work. A 
part of this tragedy was the sad fiict 
that many had worked for years with 
the full expectation that ;hey would be 
entitled to retire under the company 
pension plan. This hope was shattered 
and only n few realized the benefits

were rained out, but they were on the 
right track. 

I feel that this is taking apathy a 
little too far for our own good. Is there 
no one on this campus who can really 
elevate IU-PU to the status of a real 
college by merely taking off his 
clothes and going? Why not combine 
two aspects of college life by holding 
just one cross-country team practice 
in the buff? Is that so much to ask? 

Perhaps Safety and Security 
could become nation-wide pacesetters 
by patrolling stark naked. I would 
think that this would have real impact 
on the DGTS or bank runs. Come on 
guys, how about a little school spirit? 
It would give this school valuable 
network publicity, and make Indiana- 
Purdue Universities Fort Wayne 
Campus a nationally known school. 

This could be a good public-ser- 
vice project for Circle-and it 
certainly would look good in the 
scrabook. After the streak, those 
people and Students' Governments 
could hold another marathon to raise 
bail and defense money for those 
caught. The Student Union Boarc 
could bring in an appropriate band 
and to top it all off, Convo could bring 
back Tempest Storm. 

Since streaking has become such 
a big college sport, why not give out 
letters for the best streaking on 
campus? Perhaps a blanket would be 
an appropriate award for achieve- 
ment in this sport. Another good idea 
would be ski masks or sneakers in the 
school colors. I believe firmly that 
this would be one sport that would 
draw crowds on this campus. This is 
the kind of sport that the whole 
Student Body would get behind. 

Once and for all, let's rid 
ourselves of the view held by some 
that this is not really a college. Come 
on, IU-PU, grin and bare it!

PRO BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS 

The senior circuit of pro basketball (NBA) will be 
moving into the payoffs shortly, and strange as it might 
seem, several new teams have moved into the picture. Of 
course, the traditional Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, 
and the Jabbar-led Milwaukee Bucks will be back, but an 
added treat will be the presence of the Detroit Pistons. The 
Detroit Pistons in the playoffs? Believe it or not, they will 
probably be there. 

Even though they are in third place behind Chicago and 
division leader Milwaukee, they have a chance to make it 



playoffs. 

These third place teams have been given a chance 
thanks to a change of format by the league executives. 
Whereas it used to be in the past that the top two teams from 
each of the four divisions went into the post season playoffs, 
it is now arranged so that the top teams of the four divisions 
are joined by the four other teams with the best seasonal 
marks. 

This was a worthy decision made by the NBA, as it 
gives the teams that are unfortunate enough to be in a 
stacked division the opportunity to continue on. Ray Scott's 
competitive Pistons would have had to wait another year if 
the format had not been changed. 

While Buffalo is staging a late season surge in an 
attempt to make the playoffs, Golden State and 'Los 
Angeles are fighting for the first place position in 
the Western Division. Rick Barry, who has been averaging 
over thirty points in the last month, has led his team past 
the Lakers, and now they lead the division by a half game. 

The absences of Wilt Chamberlain and Jim McMilland 
and the limited play of injury-ridden Jerry West have 
changed LA from a super team to a mediocre one. 

The New York Knicks are the defending champions, but 
that doesn't necessarily make them the favorites for this 
year. Even though they have their entire squad back from 
last year, they have had a lot of injuries this season, A 
healthy Knick team will again be hard to beat. 

If there was to be a designated favorite, it would 
probably have to be the Milwaukee Bucks. Jabbar is always 
tough to stop, even if he can't go to his left. Milwaukee has 
had the best seasonal record, but strange things happen in 
the playoffs. Last year they were knocked off convincingly 
by Golden State in only six contests. 

Beware of the Celtics. A healthy Havlicek could bring 
them another championship. The versatile redhead, Dave 
Cowens, is always dangerous. 

Golden State, Chicago, and Detroit could all win it, if 
things would fall their way. They all need to be extra 
persistent in order to challenge the big three, 

Buffalo with league-leading scorer, McAdoo could pull 
some surprises if they make the playoffs, but they will 
probably have to wait another year. Capital and Los 
Angeles don't pose much of a threat. They both should go 
out early. 

'over in the ABA, there isn't much to get excited about. 
Utah, Kentucky, New York, Carolina, and Indiana are the 
teams that will be fighting for the title. Utah, with their 
bench strength, could be the team to beat. The Pacers are 
always tough in the playoffs. Dr. J. and the New York Nets 
could be the biggest surprise. 



COLLEGE POST £ 

The NCAA tournament looks like the same old thing, 
but with a little more competition for the Bruins. North 
Carolina State and Notre Dame could both pose a real 
threat for the annual champions. 

However, if Walton performs like he did against 
Southern California, I don't see much hope for any of the 
challengers. 

The NIT tournament has several of the country's top 
teams, but Maryland thought they were too good for it. I 
wonder who they think they are? Hawaii, North Carolina, 
and Purdue look to be the toughest teams in the 
tournament. North Carolina will be playing early against 
Purdue, so some of the other teams got lucky. North 
Carolina has only lost five games (to two teams), but 
Purdue is certainly no pushov er. 

There are some better teams in the new tournament at 
St. Louis than one might think. Tennessee, Indiana, and 
Southern California lead the list. Indiana should actually be 
in the NCAA, but they couldn't quite handle a rough 
Michigan team.

:. Always one of the biggest crowd pleasers in 
Indiana, these 16 teams will compete in Semi-State action 
Saturday. 

Elkhart will take on number one Anderson in the first 
game at Fort Wayne, while the host Northrop Bruins will be 
playing Logansport in the second game. The winners will 
clash at 8:15. 

The Northrop Bruins (rated fifth in the state) looked 
impressive against South Side in the afternoon tilt, but 
looked sluggish in their win over DeKalb in the Fort Wayne 
Regional competition, 

DeKalb upset a highly overrated East Noble squad in 
the first afternoon game. East Noble came into the game 
with a remarkable 17-2 record, but was a great 
disappointment, especially to the East Noble fans. One East 
Noble fan had told me earlier in the season that he thought 
East Noble could beat Northrop. He didn't say anything 
about what they could do with DeKalb, whom Northrop beat 
by 19. 



SUPERSTAR 

Kyle Rote, Jr., took top honors in the second annual 
Superstar competition. He won three events (of the seven he 
was in), and out-pointed the defending champion, pole 
valulter Bob Seagren. Dick Anderson, the fine Miami 
defensive back was a close third, and O.J. managed fourth 
place. 

Rote used his athletic skills to win swimming, tennis, 
bowling, and to place second in golf and bike racing. Even 
though he didn't score in baseball hitting or the 880 run, he 
was still able to hold off a charging Seagren. 

Curry Kirkpatrick, who wrote an article about the 
superstar competition in Sports Illustrated, made an 
interesting comment about the competitors, or I guess you 
could say the non-competitors. 

Kirkpatrick said in his article, "No golfers-tremendous 
athletes that they are-dare show up."
