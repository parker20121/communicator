Former candidate fights probation 



student's appeal 
denied 



by Nol Reckky 
Managing Editor 

I 

1 1 Formci Indiana Puiditc Studeni 
Govemmenl Associalion (IPSGA) 
presidcniial candidate Kerry Adkins 
is still on probation afier his appeal 
was denied by the Campus Appeals 
Board on Friday 

Adkins was placed on probation 
at ttaeendofSpnng '96afier he was 
found guilty of trespassing in the 



Career Services onice. 

"Since the codes are very specif- 
ic about who is informed il's not 
^propriale for mc to publicize the 
Hndings," said David McCanis. 
associate vice chancellor of academ- 
ic affairs and chair of the campus 
appeals board. 

McCanLs said the student code 
only allows (he chair of the appeals 
board to furnish copies of the find- 
ings 10 the studem and Ihe dean of 
students. 

The chancellor is also notified 
about the decision. McCants added. 

On the evening of April 24, 
1996, Adkins entered the office of 
Marian Zimmerman, dean of siu- 



denls, and found the IPSGA presi- 
dential ballot box unsecured Adkins 
claimed thai was a violation of the 
IPSGA constitution. 

At that lime Adkins said he was 
concerned with possibility of some- 
one tampering with the ballots. 

Adkins was running for IPSGA 
president against George Gounaris 

Adkins also filed ta official 
complaint with Lhe studem govem- 
menl election board renuesiing the 
possibly tainted ballots he found 
should be thrown out, 

Zimmerman previously said pro- 
cedures for handling the ballot boi 
had become lax in recent years 

)hc also said rales would be 



more clearly defined in the future so 
something like this could not hap- 
pen again. 

Adkins met with Randall Borst, 
director of services for students with 
disabilities, in an informal heanng 

After the meeting, Adkins was 
placed on placed on probation for 
violating the student's code of con- 
duct. 

If Adkins is found to commit 
another violation of the code, he 
will be suspended from IPFW, 

"I was found guilty of trespass- 
ing." be said. 

The appeals board said they 
thought Adkins should have taken 
other .ictions such as informing the

reading in a coffee house while 
going berserk on a cappucmo buu. 
If only IPFW had a place where any 
moron could drink coffee and listen 
to poetry. 

Someone in SAB must have 
been louched by Beavis' poetry 
also. 

The Student Activities Board

The Smashing Pumpkins really got into the Halloween Profewors that 

gplfjf participated in the 




fust meeting mclude David Maloney. associate 
professor of physics; Clifford Scott, associate 
professor of history, and several others 

Even though only two studenis made it to the 
fu^t meeting, the faculty members maintain their 
belief in the program. 

"I was very surprised there weren't many stu- 
dents, even in the cafeteria," said Maloney. "I 
don't know if students were really aware of it." 

"1 think it's an idea well worth trying." added 
Maloney "I'd like to see it succeed. Students 
should try it for a semester to see if they arc real- 
ly inieresied." 

Maloney feels it would be much easier to 
orgam^c and mn such a program on a residential 
campus He understands that many students on a 
commuter campus do not have the time because 
many students take classes full time and also 
carry a heavy work load. 

"We hope to develop the number {of students) 
as the year progresses," said Scott. "I think il's a 
really good idea," 

Scon thought the meeting went well, and he 
was very (impressed with the outcome of the hon- 
ors program event from the night before. On 
Wednesday, many siudents from the honors pro- 
gram visited the Fori Wayne Museum of An. 
Siudents were able to see an eidiibit designed by 
fellow campus siudents. 

"One of my many goals is to fosier the devel- 
opment of a community on campus, where stu- 
dents and faculty can share the experience of 
learning." said Kubic.

Workshop attempts 
to reduce prejudice 



by Paul Tupp«r 
Editor 



What do you say 
who has been hurt by racism'.' How 
can you assist someone who has 
been affected by sexism? What can 
you do lo remove Ihe tnjsinforma- 
tiofl that keeps discrimination of any 
form in place? Three words: educa- 
tion, education, education. 

Paul M. Terry, assistant professor 
of education, has coordinated the 
workshop "Prejudice Reduction: 
Celebrating Diversity," from the 
National Coalition Building Institute 
of Washinglon, DC, to be held Nov, 
15 in the Walb Memorial Union 
Ballroom from 8:30 a.m, lo 3:30 
p.m. The workshop is aimed al 
school superinlendenls. principals, 
counselors, teachers, central office 
admin is tralors and staff, community 
leaders and studenis. 

"This IS open to everyone and 
anyone." said Terry. "It focuses on 
school people and educators, but 
will expand to businesses this 
spring," 

The workshop will address such 
issues as race, eihniciiy. gender, reli- 
gion, economic background, sexual 
orientation and identifying the mis- 
information of each group. Those 
attending will also learn about 
expressing pride and bow to inter- 
rupt prejudicial Jokes. 

Sondra Mergentbal, cultural 
diversity coordinator for East Allen 
County Schools (EACS). and a 
group of EACS teachers who have 
been trained by the National 
Coalition Building Institute wilJ 
conduct die workshop, Mergcnthal 
thinks the members will teach others 
as well as learn new perspectives. 

"People will learn more about 



their ethnicities while learning about 
others," she said. "There will be lots 
of pairing and lots of sharing by 
everyone who attends." 

Mergenihal and her team have 
presented this prop^m many times 
in \he past, including at Ball State 
University and Ihe New Haven 
Police DqiaitmenL

Atlanta bombing symptom of U.S. problem 



Noi 
eckley 




In one swifi motion, the FBI 
and starved news hounds 
(umed a hero into one of the 
most hated men in die world. 

During the Olympics, we all wit- 
nessed the explosion which killed 
several people and mjured many oth- 
ers We were shown technicolor ver- 
sions of the bombing Even the kid 
who caught the fly ball in the 
Yankees game didn't get this many 
angles shown on TV. 

Richard Jewell had his life rav- 
aged by the FBI when his name was 
leaked to 'llie Atlanta Journal- 
Constitution. Oiher newspapers 
quickly leapt on the story and Jewell 
hke ravenous hyenas. 



I do not 
place all blame 
on the news 
media. In my 
eyes, the FBI 
deserves the 
majority of 
blame because 
they led the 
animals lo the 
raw flesh 

What 
their purpose 
was in doing 
this will proba- 
bly never be known, but it does raise 
some serious questions: 

What happens lo people who are 
laken off the cross after only a day of 
crucifixion? Are thcw bodies taken 
down and sent off as is or does (he 
government owe (he person it 
wrongly persecuted a return (o (heir 
old lifc&gt; 

The government bas issued an 
o^icial apology. So whaL that does- 
n't keep a roof over Richard Jewell's 
head or food on his table. 

Someone in the government has 
mined this man's hfe and should 
have to make restitution for his mis- 
take. 



We all have the possibihty of affliction, 

being persecuted by the govemmem. We are approaching a new mil- 

becausc most people don't even lennium and there could be a mass 

need to be convicted anymore — ^jusi consciousness of people who rise up

Guest Column 



I just returned from Sydney. 
AusiraJia, where I worked on a doc- 
umentary about a conference called 
"Endangered Tibet: Crisis on the 
Roof of the World ■• 

It was organized by my brother 
Chris and featured as its keynote 
speaker, The Dalai Lama, spiritual 
leader of Tibet and winner of ihe 
Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. 

A little over a week later, this 
year's Peace Prize was awarded to 
two men for their work to free East 
Timor from die clutches of 



Indonesia. 
Carlos Belo 
IS a Roman 
Catholic 
Bishop and 
Jose Ramos - 
fiorta, an 
aciivisl-in- 
exile who 
was visiting 
his mother in 
Sydney when 
the prize was 
announced. 

Since 
Indonesia 
borders 
Australia, and because Ramos- 
Hona has Australian residency, 
much was made in the Australian 
media about the award. 

Since 1975, Indonesia forces 
have murdered an estimated 
200,000 people m East Timor and 
have conducted a reign of terror 
against anyone who dares to dis- 
sent. The situation is similar lo thai 
of Tibet, which China invaded in 
1949 and rules with brutal force- 
Some people at the conference 
suggested Tibet's only hope is U.S. 



intervention. If (ha('s true, then 
Tibet has no hope at all. 

The Dalai Lama, himself, said 
as much in a speech at the Sydney 
Eniertainmcnl Center, Calling for 
his familiar plea for peace and for 
non-violent solutions to (he prob- 
lems of humanity He pointed out 
that m order to have peace, human 
beings must stop making folk 
heroes oul of killers. 

As an example, he pointed lo 
the US involvement in the Gulf 
War, which saw America make folk 
heroes out of the two mihtary lead- 
ers who led US, forces to this 
amazing victory ovCT Iraq, a coun- 
try die size of Colorado, Both 
Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin 
Powell were vinually unheard of 
before they gladly annihilated inno- 
cent civilians in the name of nation- 
al defense 

Given this son of national men- 
(ali(y and charac(er. it comes as no 
surprise that the Uniied Stales of 
America is Uie leading provider of 
weapons of deadi (o Indone-sia from 
1975 to the present. 

According to syndicated colum- 
nist Colman McCarthy, (he U.S. 



approved the 1975 invasion, and 
the blood bath continues unabated 
under the Clinton administration 
with the sale of "nine F-16 fighter 
jets to Indonesia early nexl year." 

In another speech, the Dalai 
Lama asked, "We human beings. 
What is wrong with us?" 

Here in Amenca we might do 
well (0 nanow dial quesdon lo, 
"We Americans What is wrong 
with us?" 

At (he "Endangered Tibe(" con- 
ference he ended on a positive note 
by (banking (he conference orga- A 
nizers on behalf of (he six million 
innocent people of Tibet who have 
no voice on the world stage. 

At that moment I was so proud 
of my brother. 1 s(aned to cry And 
I realized the hope of Tibet, of East 
Timor, of all oppressed people lies 
not with governments but widi ded- 
icated individuals like Chris and tbe 
dozens of Australians who worked 
night and day without pay to make 
[he conference a reahty. and Jose 
Ramos-Horia and Carlos Belo, who 
worked in the shadows until the 
Nobel Pnze cast them in the hghl. 

May we all end up there.

Last spring, 1 was asked to 
deTine culture in a lest 
quesUon for a class I was 
taking. "Iniercullural 
Communicaiion," If I remember 
correcUy . my definition went some- 
thing like this; "anything and every- 
thing that unites and defines a com- 
munity, including, but not limited 
to, artifacts, cspenences, language, 
food, activities and education," 
Since I define culture in this 
manner, one can assume that I see 
I being gay as also being a member of 
! a culture. We certainly have artifacts 
(the pink triangle, the rainbow flag), 
languages (gayspeak). activities 
(social functions), and experiences 
(see every column I've written up to 
today) that allow us to be defined as 
a culture. 

It may also be assumed that if I 
think gayness is a culture, then I 
think IPFW's Office of 
Multicultural Services should be 
connected to the gay cotimiunity in 
some way. But when I look at the 
office's calendar of events for the 
fall of this year, I don't see any 
activity scheduled with any mem- 
bers of the gay community, includ- 
ing OUT own student organization. 
United Sexualities, 

I also look at the Ust of sponsors 
who enthusiastically and financially 
supported the performances of Dan 
Butler, the openly gay actor who 
recently performed his brilliant 
play, "The only thing worse you 
could have told me .,.," and see that 
Multicultural Services is absent 
from the list. But, in the office's 
defense. 1 asked IPSGA President 
"Geo" (jounans bow be coordinat- 
ed the fimds for the play. He told me 
that he approached ail of the people 
on the list and stopped when enough 
money was raised to bring BuUei to 
campus. So Multicultural Services 
was not approached to donate

If this is 
the normal 
praclice. ihai 
interested par- 
lies and groups 
have to 

^proach Multicultural Services for 
mvolvemeni, I have a problem with 
that. Please note that I haven't seen 
a mission statement of the office oi 
the job descriptions of its workers, 
so I don't know what their goals and 
missions are. But I think this office 
should be PROACTIVE instead of 
REACTIVE. I think it should have 
sought involvement with such a cul- 
turally educating opportunity, rather 
than wait to be asked. 
Multiculturaiism is such an impor- 
tant issue on this campus and in this 
community. I have a hard time 
understanding why an office 
designed to meet those needs on 
campus would sit and wait to get 
involved. Should we wait until a 
black student is murdered before we 
try to smooth race relations on cam- 
pus? Should we wait until a gay stu- 
dent commits suicide before we try 
10 eradicate homophobia? 

This brings me to my next point; 
Why do we have individuals coordi- 
naung Diversity Week? Shouldn't 
that be the job of Multicultural 
Services? I think Multicultural 
Services should be making a proac- 
tive effort to bring this campus such 
events throughout the entire year, 
not just a week-long celebration. 
But instead, we have individuals, 
including myself, working extra 
hours to bring this event to campus. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to 
be involved. But why did it take an 
individual who doesn't work in 
Multicultural Services to have this 
idea of Diversity Week? And why is 
another individual, ag^n, who is 
not employed by the office of 
Multicultural Services. coordinaUng 
the events this year? I don't mean to

suggest that la.st year's or dus year's 
Diversity Week Committee Ch^rs 
are not qualified to do so - on the 
conuary. But aren't they doing the 
job of the Multicultural Services 
director? 

Perhaps my discomfort with 
Multicultural Services should be 
directly attribuied to its director, 
Christine Patterson. Patterson is a 
we II -educated, articulate person, but 
my analysis tells me that she pri- 
marily focuses 



she has done little, if anything, to 
see that the gay culture is included 
in Multicultural Services, Perhaps 
she is merely doing what she is 
being asked by the university, and 
that is to concentrate her efforts 
toward students of color. But surely 
a person of her education, back- 
ground and age would see that gays 
struggle in the university, too, and 
her office could help in a number of 
ways. But I fear that Is not the case 
In a recent 



on African- 
American 
events. Now, I 
definitely 
would support 
the idea of 
having an 
office of 

African- 
American 
Services, espe- 
cially in this 
city. But that's 
not what we 
have. On cam- 



pus, 

depa' 



the 
nent 



Should we wait 
until a gay stu- 
dent commits 
suicide before we 
try to eradicate 
homophobia? 



Patterson' 

focus should 
be the whole 
gamut of mul- 
ticulturaiism. 

As for the 
gay culture 
being silently 

excluded from ^-^— 

Multicultural 

Sen'ices, I'm not surprised. In fact, 
the description of Multicultural 
Services in the 1996-97 Student 
Handbook and Planner states: 
"Multicultural Services provides a 
support system for International, 
Afncan American, Hispanic, Native 
American and other students of 
color ..," Tliis just proves how little 
respect the gay community gets 
from other civil rights efforts and 
their organizers. As for Patterson, a 
person who ihe university feels is 
qualified to direct this office. I feel 



presentation 
given by her to 
the class 

"Women, Men 
and Media" 
regarding the 
media's portray- 
al of minorities, 
Patterson 
focused only on 
African 
Americans. 
When another 
student and 1 
asked her opin- 
ion regarding 
gay portrayals 
on television. 
Patterson began 
to use the same 
excuses many 
while producers 
and educators 
use when 

answering accu- 
sations of mis- 
^^— portraying black 
characters, sug- 
gesting that gay issues were so new, 
nobody knew how to tackle them 
and that the entertainment industry 
should ease this topic into shows. 



Well. IS Patterson forgetting how 
many gay people are in Hollywood 
and how many gay people are 
employed in creative professions in 
television? If tackling this "new" 
issue was any problem, then the 
writer^; and producers should have 
simply asked the nearest gay per- 
son, which couldn't have been that 
far away fTierefore. I don't think 
there is any justification for portray- 
ing gays in the negative, stereotypi- 
cal manner that they have been, and 
continue to be 

I think the university needs to re- 
examine the role of Multicultural 
Services and what it takes to be its 
director As for Patterson, it's been 
my experience that , . well, let's just 
say the gay community has better 
friends than Christine Patterson.

Student orsanization reviews Flanasan's 

...Oh waiter 



by Susie Wilkinson 
Staff Writer 

Many students at IPFW are not 
aware that there ls a Resiaurant- 
Hoiel-Instilutionat Management 
program (RHI), So a few of us in 
RHI have set out to introduce our 
program to you. We decided we 
would do so by evaluating one of 
our favorite restaurants for you 
Not that we don't all appreciate 
our city's own restaurant critic but 
we want to give you the view of 
dining dirough the collegiate eyes 
of budding hospitarians. 

We arrived at Flanagan's 
Restaurant, 6525 Covington Road. 
and found ample parking with 
well maintamed grounds. Hopmg 
to be greeted with an open door 
and friendly smile, we were sur- 
prised when greeted by the half- 
hearted hosts that stood behind the 
podium in the lobby. However, we 
were imtially unpressed by the 
cleanliness of the dining room and 
the casual atmosphere. 

Our server proved to be a def- 
inite asset to the propeny as she 



sianed out by promptly greeting 
each member of our group as they 
separately arrived She was patient 
with out ordering as we needed 
extra time to look over the exten- 
sive menu A more limited menu 
might have been better since we 
felt that we should have taken it 
home in advance in order to study 
ii Aside from that, the menu was 
well laid out. and easy to under- 
stand. Our waitress was very 
knowledgeable about the specials 
of the day. including prices and 
descriptions of menu items, We 
were all impressed when we asked 
about the available salad dressings 
and she cited all 11 without besiia- 
lion. 

The food was very flavorful 
and the portions generous Our 
side salads were a decent sire and 
contained a colorful combination 
of salad greens, tomatoes, egg, 
cheese, and onion. On the down- 
side, the lettuce - aldiough fresh - 
tasted like a bagged mix and the 
buttered garlic bread that accom- 
panied the salad was without gar- 
lic One patron found Ihe Club- 



Style Croissant to be a tasty selec- 
tion and prepared correctly — 
without tomaioes as requested 

Another member of RHI rec- 
ommends the Meatball Submarine 
Sandwich with jumbo meatballs. 
langy marinara sauce and melted 
cheese served on a warm sub roll, 
made only belter with a 
side of cnsp. band-breaded 
onion rings The Chicken 
Cordon Blue was a savory 
choice, with the exception 
of it being poorly gar- 
nished, and a side of 
fetiuccinc alfredo that i 
balanced improperly 
with the white-sauce 
drizzle on the chicken. I 
ordered the Blackened 
Chicken Alfredo and was pre- 
sented with a more than gen- 
erous portion of fettuccine 
alfredo lopped with Cajun 
spiced grilled chicken. It 
was m outstanding dish, but 
also would have benefited 
with additional alfredo sauce. 

Our meals were brought to a 
close with a nch and delicious, but 



almost loo sweet, chocolate cook- 
ie cheesecake. 

Finally, our waitress was very 
atieniive and courteous, with the 
exception of our salad plates, she 
kept our table cleared of unnccded 
disties, and 
^g^^ again with 
one excep- 
tion, was 
very prompt with 
beverage refills. 

~ lanagan's 
food is priced moder- 
ately, and they offer a var- 
ied menu They have a 
wide variety of sandwiches 
and entree salads for just 
around S6 Pasta, chicken 
and seafood cost just a bit 
more at S8 99, with steaks 
and ribs topping the price list 
at $15.99 

In our opinion, 
Ranagan's offers good food, 
good service and an enjoyable 
atmosphere for a moderate price, 
an extienence we definitely rec- 
ommend.

Tool's 'Anemia' 



by James Cormn 
Staff Writer 



market worth investing in no mailer how poor 
one might be I took a chance last weekend lo bs- 
len to the new Tool album cnutlcd "Atiemia " 
Attention aUITbcre is Tmally aCDouionlhe I was both shocked and pleased to see this 




Members ot Tool with what looks to be ttieir manager. 



group held fast to its previous style, raihct than 
changing to conform with mainstream alterna- 
tive, especially since similar groups such as Rage 
Against (he Machme and Nine Inch Nails have 
enjoyed so much more popularity 

My questioning of whether or not this album 
would rock was quickly answered by the first 
three tracks of the album. The thuiecnth Crack, 
which is also the title irack to the album, is 
equally awesome with a rawness to the lyncs 

It delivered a respectable punch that left you 
thinking. Tool's vocals arc also very clear and 
clever, not at all filled with any mindless mum- 
bling or talkmg which resides in some other smi- 
ilar groups. 

I was also very impressed with the CD's artis- 
tic design on die from cover. For those who have 
not seen the album yet, die CD has a diree 
dimensional cover with three page inserts 

My only problem with the album setup is the 
fact thai the songs are not listed on the CD or 
back cover. In order to find the name of die sung 
you must read dirough die crediLs and count 
which song is the one bemg listened lo, 

Olher than this. I can sec no reason why a per- 
son would nol want this new album release to 
add 10 dieir quality compact disc collcctjon, TTie 
album IS defumely worth the time and money

StafT Writer 



Now thai 
it's dial 
to be ( 



■" ow thai summer is over, 
it's thai lime of ihe year 
: on guard against 
the flu bug. With winler 
drawing near, it's lime to team 
about flu immunizalion shots. 

Influenza, commonly known as 
the flu. is a serious viral disease. 
There arc two types of flu viruses, 
Type A and Type B Type A influen- 
za causes more severe symptoms 
and is more likely to lead lo compli- 
cations than TVpe B innuen7.a. The 
flu vaccination typically protects 
against iwo type A sOrains and one* 
type B strain predicted lo be die 
most serious in the upcoming year. 

The effect o( Ihe flu immuniza- 
tion depends on bow closely the 
vaccine strains match Ihe circulat- 
ing strains of die influenza. Il is 
possible dial you can be infected 
with a different svam of Hu viruses 
than die one for which you have 
been vaccinated, and thereby devel- 
op influenza. 

An influenza virus is spread 
from an infected person to others 
via airborne droplets by talkmg. 
coughing or sneezing. The flu virus 
can also be iransmilied via direct 
contact, such as touching an "infect- 
ed" tissue and dicn touching your 
hand to your nose or mouth. For 
some people, the fever, chills. 
weakness, headache, cough, sore 
throat and muscle oain symptoms 
are over in a week_ For others, how- 
ever, having ibe flu can lead lo more 
serious outcomes, such as pneumo- 
nia or death. According lo Centers 
for Disease Conlrol and Prevenuon 
(CDC), the average flu season kills 
thousands of Americans with more 
dian 90 percent of victims 65 or 
older Nol only does influenza 
increase hospitalizations and med- 
ical costs but also decTcases produc- 
tivity in the workplace and schools 

Why get tlie 
flu shot? 

The tlu injection puis an inacti- 
vated or weakened flu virus direaly 
into your bloodstream, which 
prompts your body lo produce anti- 
bodies (o fight against the flu bug 
when it attacks your body. 
"Vaccines are ihe mosi direct 
defense you can give your txxJy 
against some diseases," explains 
Raymond Strikes, M.D, medical 
epidemiologist widi the National 
Immunization Program However. 
the flu shot does not guarantee full 
protection Some may still get flu 
symptoms, but ihey are less severe 
than if die person bad noi received 
die flu shot. 

Who should get 
the flu shot? 

High nsk groups such as those 
aged 65 or older, residents of nurs- 
ing homes and long-term care facil- 
ities: adulLs and chddren (6 months 
and older) with chronic bean or 
lung problems, diabetes, kidney or 



blood disease; or those with low- 
ered resistance to fight off infection. 
such as persons widi AIDS, or on 
chemotherapy, or on long-term 
steroids Any and all of these people 
should receive a flu vaccination. 

Other at-risk people include 
children and leens with long-term 
aspirin complicalions. people hos- 
piialized in the past year or those 
who have had repealed medical care 
over the last year, and are advised 
10 gel a flu vaccination as well, 

CDC also encourages people 
who might transmit influenza lo 
high-nsk individuals lo get die flu 
shot. Among this group are health 
care workers at hospitals or long- 
term care facilities, volunteers pro- 
viding care for high-risk persons 
and anyone living with a person in a 
high-risk group. In addition, die flu 
vaccine may be given to anyone 
who desires lo decrease their 
chance of getting the flu. Pregnant 
women should consult with their 
physiaan regarding the flu shot. 
Who should nol get 
the flu shot? 

People who are already suffer- 
ing from an illness should nol be 
vaccinated until their symptoms are 
gone so they can get die full protec- 
uon Tbose who are allergic lo eggs 
should nol get die flu shot, since the 
vaccine is provided from a virus 
thai is grown in eggs. Those allergic 
to eggs can take a low-cost anti-flu 
medication, such as amantadine or 
rimantadine, as a preventative mea- 
sure or treatment 

When should you get 
the flu shot? 

Yearly flu shots are necessary 
because Ihe composition of Ihe vac- 
cine is updated every year. Randall 
Owen. Ph D., a virologist ai St. Jude 
Children's Hospital in Memphis, 
Tenn , explained, "every season 
there's a new strain of flu circulat- 
ing... Once II afTecis one person, it 
undergoes several mutations So the 
vims I get mfecicd widi may be a 
lilde bil difTcreni from die one dial 1 
ihen transmil lo die ncJit person..." 
Therefore, your nalural immune 
defenses may nol recognize diis 
winter's new flu strains, which 
necessitates a flu shot yearly. 

Since die flu vaccine takes about 
one 10 two weeks after the injection 
to begin providing prolecuon, the 
optimal lime lo get the annual flu 
immunization is between mid 
October and mid November to pre- 
pare for the peak llu season which is 
between laie December and early

MaR'h, Children under nine years of 
age who have not had a previous flu 
immunization will need a second 
shot after one mondi. 

Where do you get 
Ihe flu shot? 

According to Pal MurUand, 
Nursing Supervisor ai die Allen 
County Department of Health, flu 
shots will be available Oct 28 for 
die public. The cost will be S4. The 
average cost for Ihe flu shot is S7 - 
SI 5 at doctors' offices or walk-in 
clinics. The fiu immunization is 
covered by Medicare Fortunately, 
more companies, hospitals and 
health ma inie nance organizations 
(HMO's) are giving free or low cost 
vaccinations for their employees 
and members Check with your 
employer regarding flu shots. 

Are there side effects? The flu 
vaccine is safe according to the 
CEX?, The majority of people who 
gel the fiu shot have no serious 
problems, although there can be 
soreness ai the injection site thai 
lasis up 10 two days, affecting fewer 
dian one Uiird of diose who get die 
vaccine. A few individuals suffer 
fever and fatigue, Atcording to 
Edwm D Kilboume. M.D.. 
research professor of microbiology 
and immunology at New York 
Medical College, life-direatening 
allergic reactions, as well as 
Guillain-Barre syndrome, a nerve 
disorder, are rare t&gt;ecause current 
fiu vaccines are highly purified 
Since the flu vaccine is made from 
"killed" virus, you cannot contact 
the fiu from the vaccine 

If you suffer a serious reaction 
from the flu vaccine, you need to 
call or see the doctor right away, 
write down die date and time of die 
event, and have a Vaccine Adverse 
Event Report form filed by medical 
personnel, or call (800) 822-7967. 

Like the common cold, diere is 
no cure for die llu, However, you 
can dec-reasc die impact of ihe dis- 
ease by getting a yearly llu vaccina- 
tion. Remember, getting Ihe flu shot 
this season does not mean that you 
an.' immune from other viral dis- 
eases. 

For more information atwut the 
influenza shoi, ask your doctor or 
call die Allen County Department 
of Healdi at 449-7514

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. What's the point of 
HIV resting? If you've 
got HIV, you're going to 
die "before your time" 
and why would anyone 
want to know that? 

A. Medicines are now 
available that can prolong 
the period of good health 
and prevent illness m 
people with HIV. Better 
treatments and possibly a 
cure may be found before 
those now infected get sick 
or die. Also, if you are 
infected, you must take 
precautions not to infect 
others

Forensic League begins year of competition 



by Jftrmy l-xenhorEir 

Whether il Is the presidential 
debate, a professor's lecture or a 
casual conversation on campus, the 
latent of good communication skills 
can be rewarding While kicking a 
football, hiilmg a baseball or run- 
nmg a 50-yard dash may be reward- 
ing, moving an audience with your 
voice beats all the rest. 

Lasi weekend, IPFW's Forensic 
League traveled to Ball Slate 
University to compeie in a speech 
loumamcnl for the National 
Forensics Association (NFA). 

The league is sponsored by the 
student government. 

Team members William 
Andrews. Kenneth Nagic and Daniel 
Westrick compeled in speaking 
evenis at the loumameni. The com- 
pctilion drew more than a donen 
teams from around the midwesi 
region. 

According to Tamara L. 
Compton. director of the forensics 
team, the event was cuiremely com- 
petitive. Universities such as 
Bradley, Indiana, Ohio State and 
Ball Stale had very large teams, 
compared lo IPFW's team of three 
Compton said the univei^ilies com- 
peted very seriously 

This Ls Compion's first year on 
campus. She has previously taught 
at West Minster College in Salt Lake 
City, Utah, 

■'Many universities have three or 
four coaches," said Complon, 

Along with the size, the team is 
very inexperienced. In fact, the 
entire team consists of ttew mem- 
bers. 

■| don't think we were as pre- 
p.ired as we should have been," said 
Andrews Andrews is currently por- 
traying Dromio of Ethcsus in the 
Civic Theatre's production of "The 



Comedy of Erron." 

This was the forensic league's 
second competition. On Oct. 18 and 
19. the team competed at Miami 
University in Oxford, Ohio. 

Categories in 

which students 

compete 



Tamara L. 
Compton 



include 



oral 



interpretation, 
public address 
.ind limited prep 
Oial interpreta- 
tion is much like 
an acting perfor- 
mance. Students 
may use poetry. 
prose or selec- 
tions from plays m an attempt to 
move the audience. 

"It's a lot of on-your-feet think- 
ing, but you have to say things thai 
come from your heart," said 
Andrews, who participated in the 
event during the first two forensic 
competitions. 

Public address handles contro- 
versial and/or public issues and 
depends tremendously on die stu- 
dents' ability to first understand the 
question, then know background 
information and finally be able lo 
answer it respectfully This type of 
speech is coDnmonly used by gov- 
ernment onicials and lawyers. 

A new area in the public addres-; 
category is after-diimer speaking 
which gives public topics a light 
side 

"We take a serious topic and add 
humor lo it," said Westrick. 

The third category, limited prep. 
is directed towards students who 
have a wide range of knowledge, or 
simply who are jusi quick thinkerN 
Competitors have the option of par- 
ticipating in the expository or 
impromptu sections. Expository 
allows Students to carry files of 
information on a certain topic. They 



must be prepared to answer any 
question that may pertain lo the sub- 
ject. 

On the other hand, impromptu 
gives the student a topic at the time 
of competition and requires the 
speaker to develop a whole speech 
within a short lime span. The student 
has no knowledge of what the topic 
will be. 

Students Chris Adang. Geneva 
Burgess, Dawn Hogle, Sarah Milter 
and Amy Rhoades are preparing for 
future competitions this year 

'1 really wanted to conceniratc 
on my major this year," said Miller, 
a communications major Miller is 
unclear of her future plans and hopes 
the league will lead her in some 
direction 

Complon is in ihe process of 
looking for other interested studenu 
to join the leam. Sludenls must be 
enrolled in a undergraduate pro- 



gram She says that little expenencc 
is necessary, 

"Anyone with an interest is wel- 
come." said Complon. 

Upcoming competitions include 
fall tournaments at the University of 
Indianapolis; Oakland University. 
near Detroit: and Otterbein College 
m Ohio Spring semester competi- 
tions include IPFW's own Mastodon 
Stomp Tournament, the Indiana 
Slate Toumamcnl at Purdue, the 
National Novice competition in 
Chicago and NFA's national tourna- 
ment at Ball State. 

"Competitions give us a chance 
10 meet new friends. There is such a 
bond with competitors," said 
Westrick "We try to gel each other 
prepared." 

Any students who are intercsied 
in becoming a part of the leam 
should contaci Tamara L. Compton 
31481-5425.

IPFW unleashes pent up fury on hapless Cougars 




I Plialob»S«»V»i."ttn. Pr-xoEOflor 

Mike Harper, shown here playing against Semi Francis, 
proved lo be a ma|or force in Wednesday's game. 



by S. Br^nt Kdley 
Sports Editor 

IPFW gol another taste of Division Il's 
soccer elite last Wednesday as they played 
naiionally-ranked Oakland University at 
Pioneer Soccer Field in Rochester, Mich. 

"1 predict they'll make the finals in the 
tournament," IPFW coach Terry 
Stetankiewicz said 

The Pioneers treaded familiar ground, 
dousing the Maslodons 7-0 in a one-sided 
match in which Oakland scored more goals 
than IPFW took shots. 

'It started out bad." Stefankiewicz said 
"We had three kids who couldn't play 
because they were academically ineligible." 

And it got worse. A bitter, wind-blown 
rain soaked the field and when IPFW did gel 
one of its few clean looks at the opponent's 
net, tbe Ma.siodons couldn't knock ihe ball 
home for a goal. 

"The weather was horrendous," 
Stefankiewicz said, 

Justin Labnim fired a shot which skidded 
under OU goalkeeper Amir Tal, but Tal 
grabbed the ball when it was goal-side of him 
for a great save. Later, team captain Mike 
Harper slipped while on a breaJoway, and 
mLsfiredal the goal. 



Tbe third time ls usually a charm, but 
Oakland had all the luck. Danny Perez broke 
away and faced the keeper alone in goal, but 
when Ryan I&gt;rapcr. the replacement keeper 
for Tal in the 58th minute, committed, Perez 
put die ball straight to him 

When asked about his team's recent play- 
ing funk. Stefankiewicz said he had concen- 
trated on details lately and he intended to 
help his team rediscover die basics in shorter, 
more intense workouts 

"We've been going back to the military- 
style practices." he said. 

Tbe return lo tbe basics may have 
worked. Tuesday nighu the Mastodons tied 
St. Francis College Tl in regulation widi a 
second-half penalty kick, then lamed the 
Cougars with two unanswered goals in extra 
periods IPFW captain and Ail-American 
candidate Mike Harper scored all three goals 
for the Mastodons for tbe hat tnck. 

St. Franas coach Ken Nuber described 
the game as "very heated, very intense." 

"IPFW's leadership really showed 
through. Harper played better in the two 
overtimes than he did in the second half," he 
said. 

The win raised IPFW's rcconJ to 7-10 
overall The Mastodons have never lost only 
one match to the Cougars. 



Yankees take us back to baseball's glory 




Last year, when Cat KipKen 
became a national hero for showing 
up to work, many columnisB said 
he single-handedly saved baseball. 
The Yankees have just added a sec- 
ond chapter to baseball's survival 
story 

This World Series reminded me 
why baseball is an American past- 
time. You had drama, you had 
record breakers, you had victory 
and yot] had defeat, all in six games. 
Lei's tell the story, shall we. 
Before die series started. Joe 
Torre, manager of the Yankees, won 
beans on two counts: First, he 
ended bis career-long absence in a 
World Series, but not before he 
managed to become die record 
holder for the longest career in 
baseball without a series appear- 
ance. It was good to see him break 
that habit. Second, his brodier, 
Frank, lay in a hospital waiting for. 
and then receiving, a heart trans- 
plant. Early signs show he is doing 
well. Talk aboul emotion! Talk 
about drama! As if being in his first 
World Series wasn't sUessful 
enough. 

Then the games began, and die 
Atlanta Braves would grab a piec-c 
of glory Not only did they whomp 
the Yankees on their home lurf the 
first two games, but Andrew Jones 
became the first teenage player lo 
bit a home run in senes play. His 
career will be fun to watcb. 

As the senes moved to Atlanta 
and hope seemed lost for the 
Yankees. New York pulled an upset 
and beat the Braves, not once, but 
all duee games played at Fulton 
County Stadium 1^ about dosing 
out the same medicine! Tlus really 
pissed off ibc fans (not thai all is 
lost, the Braves are moving to die 
swank, new Turner Stadium, for- 
merly known as the Olympic 
Stalium) 

Game six seemed to be a sboo-in 
for die Yankees. All Ihey had to do 



IS show up and 
the fans would 
carry them 
Ihrough, As 
you know, this 
happened, 
adding anoUier 
glory into die 
books of 

Yankee histo- 
ry- 

I Ihink. 
perhaps, that's 
why I was 
rooting for New York the rich 
Yankee history. Forget George 
Sieinbrenner and diink of what the 
Yankees stand lor In my mind. 



Paul 
Tupper 



Yankee means baseball in every lan- 
guage. What player doesn't dream 
of weanng a Yankee uniform'* 

And this year's team certainly 
deserves lo stand in die same room 
with the lustrous heroes of yester- 
year, Derek Jeter showed new kids 
how to do it. Darr&gt;'l Strawberry- 
proved he loved the game more than 
cocaine. Joe Girardi caught like a 
Hue catcher should, and hit like 
every player wishes he could. These 
are just a few of ihe standouts from 
a great lineup. 

1 would veniure lo say dial 
Torre's brodier has recuperated as 
well as he has because he has 
tfcmendous pnde for his brother 



Now that is die power of what 1 
remember to be baseball!

VoUeydons lose first conference match 




Julie Parrot looks on in disbelief as Lewis University scored one of their points thai helped 
beat Ihe Volleydons. 



by S. Bninl Kellcy 
Sports Editor 

The Volleydons improved to 22-7 
over the pasi week, hui suffered anoih- 
er setback in the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference with a sliajgbt-sei loss ai 
Lewis University ai Romeoville. lU on 
Fnday afiemoon. 

Su!l Slinging from two losses in four 
maiches the previous weekend, ihe 
Volleydons fell lo lO-I wiih a third loss 
in six matches, and continued in their 
slump, radically dilTcreniiating them 
from die squad o( a month ago which 
won two slraighi-sci maiches against 
Grand Valley Slate University 

"I'm not sure we hit a midseason 
peak." IPFW coach Tim Heffron said. 
"as much as we regressed . we gol sat- 
isfied. Hopefully, they're wdling lo 
work 10 gci where we should be " 

Wednesday matched IPFW against 
Hillsdale College for the second time 
this season and resulted m a win against 
the Chargers for the second time. 

"IPFW's a good team and Uiey can be 
iniimidaiing," said Chnst Gravel, HC 
coach. "Everything Ihey hit was gold- 

The Volleydons took Wednesday's 
match in ilirec straight games, 15-2, 15- 
8. 15-1, despne a sluggish second game 
which inspired a bai^h reprimaiHl from 
Heffron. 

"That] was something where ..ilwas 
jusi laziness, " Heffron said "We just 
weren't taking care of business " 

After winning the first game with 
only a ,222 hitting percentage. HC chal- 
lenged in the second game, bringing the 
score lo 11-7 before Heffron called 
(ime-out to share feelings from his soul. 

The pep speech worked. The 
Volleydons rallied off four of the next 
five points lo take game two, then 
showed die dominance which could 
mean greamess in game three. 

"Consistency has eluded us all sea- 
son," (jiavel said. 



IPFW's one-sided play was certainly 
consistent as Uie Volleydons pounded 
h«ne half of their kill attempts and 
allowed the Chargers a soUtary point 
only after IPFW had already scored eight 
of ils own 

"Our subs coming in did a great job," 
Heffron said, "rhai's the hardest diing: 
to come in as a sub and not make mis- 
takes Not only did they not make mis- 
takes, Ihey contributed." 

Friday night bwe a different result as 
the Volleydons dropped a three-game 
match lo upstart Lewis University. 15- 
10. 15-12, 15-9. blemishing ibeii GLVC 
record for the fu-st lime this year 

"We were a little sluggish," 
Heffron said. "We just couldn't 
take care of 
t b e 
oppor- 
tunities. 

"The 
other team 
gave 
plenty 

opportunities 
... we just didn't take advantage of them. 

'They'd give us an easy ball, 
and we'd shank it into the net or 
out of bounds " 

TTie Volleydons 

dropped games one and 
three despite holding 7-2 
leads in both games. 

The Flyers, GLVC champi 
ons back in 1992 and alway 
lough on their home 
improved to 6-4 in the con- 
ference. 

"Lewis was psyched up 
for the match," Heffron said, "ai 
diey tend to play well at home 
anyway." 

The Volleydons played their 
third match in four nights in Wisconsin 
ag^si new GLVC member University 
of Wisconsin-Parkside. and almost threw 
away another match which could have 
put the conference race up for grabs. 




IPFW started the first game hoi, 
building an 11-1 lead 

"Then we'd gel into this not taking 
advantage of our opportuniiies." Heffron 
said. 

Despile theu sluggish performance, 
the Volleydons pulled out the first game, 
15-13. They came out to an even more 
immense 13-0 edge in the second game 
and won ii convinangly. 15-3. 

Then the trouble started. The Rangers 
began the third game on fire, jumping 
out to a 5-0 lead before IPFW bounced 
back to tie the score at five apiece UWP 
then oulscored the 'Dons 10-4 lo win 
game three, 15-9. 

The fourth game start- 
d out as the firet two, wiih 
ihc Volleydons ahead 14- 
7 and ready to put the 
match away. But they 
fell back into their 
slump, were 

outscored 7-0 at one 
point and dropped 
that game, 17-15 
"Wed go 
into a passive 
mode again," 
Heffron said. 

describing his 

team's performance 
1 games three and 
tour "We didn't take advan- 
tage of our opportuniiies." 

With ihc match and IPFW's 

iLVC standings in the balance, 

the Volleydons rose lo the 

occasion, taking the 

fifth game. 15-12. and 

the match 

Still in [hei 
conference lead, IPFW's 
maiches against nemesis 
Northern Kentucky University 
will tell the talc of the conference sea- 
son, and possibly of the postseason. 
After Friday's game, there will be a bon- 
fire on campus. Details will be available 
at the game. '
