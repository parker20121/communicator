Ever notice 
how it's easier 
, toace 
the courses 

you like? 

It finally comes dowi to commitment. 

When you don't like a course, it's hard to excel. The class gets 
tedious. Tlie texts get boring. The lectures get dreadful. Your work 
suffers. And so do your grades. 

Compare that with the courses you really believe in. 
You care more. You try more. And without even noticing, you just 
naturally do better _ 

It's true in school. It's true outside of schcx)l. 

For example, we believe there's just one way to brew 
Busch beer The natural way With natural ingredients. 
Natural carbonation. Naairal ageing. 

We believe that's the best way to brew a beer 

And when you believe in what you're 
doing, you just naturally do it better 

Taste a Busch and we think you'll agree.

When you believe in what you're doing,
