Possible solutions 
to parking problem 



TheBdmlnlslralion has admitled there 
IE a parking problem al IPFW For 
many sludenU ihis is nothing new. 
Many siudenls, particularly those 
coming from out o1 town, or from a Job, 
are on a light schedule They may not 
hove ihe lime to dnve around campus 
looking for a space or lo park in one of 
the two free lots and walk a half mile or 

Student Senator Sieve Payne started a 
pelitlon to add more B spaces. The 
administration hopes to add alwul ISO 
Bpaceshytheendof September Will this 
be enough? Possibly, but probably not. 

One Bolullon proposed by 
several other students is a parking 
garage. A garage would cost money, but 
it would also eliminate the present 
problem and future problems. 

The stale of Indiana has been slow to 



; spending (or education, so a 
parking garage will probably never 
become a reality. 

Another solution would tie lo add more 
lots. Again the cost has to be considered. , 
Itcouldalsodesiroy the beauty of IPFW- 

A third solution may be for the ad- 
ministration lo work with student 
government and support car-pooling, 
faking the bus, riding bicycles or 
motorcycles or walking These 
-measures would not only take pressure 
off the parking lots, but may even help to 
save gasoline. After all. Ihe U.S is still 
vulnerable to another oil embargo. 

Students from out of town would I 
benefit because they wouldn'l have 1 
drive all over campus looking for Ihat I 
elusive spot. More spots will open up if | 
these proposals are taken seriously.

Reagan's action enough 



Last Monday, PrcsidenI Reagan 
criticiied the Soviet Union more sharply 
than ever before. After accusing the 
Soviets of shooting down a Korean 747 Jet 
and killing 269 people, including a U.S. 
congressman, Reagan said the Soviets 
"owe Ihe world an apology" and "were 
violating every concept of human 
rights." 

When The Communicator went to 
press lasl Tuesday, the Soviets were still 
denying they shot the plane down. 
Reagan's remarks, however, were not 
slanderous because evidence provided 
by officials from ihe U.S. and olher 
countries clearly Indicate Reagan is 
right. Reagan's remarks were also the 
right type of response to Ihe Soviets. 
With the stale of the world as it is, a 
more aggressive move by the U.S. could 
start World War III. 

U.S. officials say an Su-15 Jet followed 
the 747 2'/! hours before nring al it. The 
Soviets admitted firing warning shoU at 
the plane, which they said was on spy 
mission. If Ihe shots were only warning 
shots, why are Ihe plane and 269 people 
missing and why was debris found near 
an Island west of Sakhalin Island? 



Perhaps the most conclusive evidence 
against the Soviets, however, is the 
conversation between Soviet Ground 
Control and the Su-15 fighter pilot, which 
was Intercepted by the State Depart- 
ment, The conversation proves the pilot 
fired a missile after being ordered lo. 

Some congressmen believe Reagan's 
action was loo lenient 

Reagan suspended negotiations on 
several bilaleial projects, demanded 
approval for U.S. ships lo participate in 
the search for wTeckage of the plane, 
suspended negotiations on several 
proposed cultural and scientific ex- 
changes, refused lo renew a lO-year-old 
agreement of cooperation in the field of 
transportation and asked US, allies to 
isolate the Soviet airliner Aeroflot from

An OWL just might 
be buying your 
lunch. 




Who says there's no free lunch. If you're a wise student 
of banking, you may soon be lunching courtesy of Fort 
Wayne National Bank. During the month of September 
the bank is going to randomly select account numbers 
from transactions made with the OWL automatic teller 
located on the lower level of the Union Building. Win- 
ners will get a free Personal Pan Pizza from Pizza Hut. 
Their names will appear in upcoming issues of the 
Communicator. If your name is there, just go to the 
State-Coliseum office (Statewood Plaza) of Fort Wayne 
National Bank and pick up your free pizza coupon. 

The OWL provides 
student aid. 

As a student, you don't always have time to run those 
little everyday errands. But thanks to the OWL 
Machine, you do have time to do your banking. The 
OWL Machine lets you get cash, make deposits or 
transfer funds without leaving campus. If you don't 
have an OWL Card, you can get one by stopping at any 
office of Fort Wayne National, Peoples Trust or Indiana 
Bank. Do it today. You might get a free lunch. 
Only transactions made at the OWL Machine on the 
lower level of the Indiana-Purdue Union Building, dur- 
ing the month of September, will be eligible for prizes.
