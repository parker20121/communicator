Series ihroughoul April on Tuesday

to ihc public. 

R. David Edmunds, professor of 
History ai (ndiana University, Bloom- 
inglon shared his views on "Sacred 
Objects and Ancestral Remains; An 
Overview of Native American Issues 
and Concerns," on April 6. As a Na- 
tive Annerican, Edmunds is deeply in- 
volved with this subject. 

Edmunds had an opportunity to pro- 
mote his lecture on radio station WB- 
NI Monday, and spoke with Gary B. 
Blumcnshine, chair and associate pro- 
fessor of History at IPFW. 

Edmunds' lecture is based on his 
concern in the way ancient burial 
grounds are being overturned during 
searches for artifacts by non-native 
Americans. 

Blumenshinc said Edmunds be- 
lieves we live in an area that romanti- 
cizes Uic perception of Indians. 

"Ethnic perception of Native Ameri- 



cans has changed since the 60s and 
70s and has now swayed popular 
opinion from Indians being the bad 
guys to now being the good guys," 
stated Blumenshinc. 

Edmunds received his Ph.D. from 
the University of Olclahoma in 1972 
and has written several books on this 
subject. "Poiawatomis: Keepers of 
the Fire" won the 1978 Francis Park- 
man prize for American History. 
Other awards include a Pulitzer Prize 
nomination in Biography in 1983 for 
his book, "The Shawnee Prophet." 

The next lecture will be April 13 
with Arthur H. Purcell, enviroiunen- 
talist. He will speak on "Resources, 
Environment, and the Future: A Hard 
Look at the Planet from the 1990s." 
His message will focus on preventive 
environmental managcmcni. 

Purcell is founder and director of 
the Resource Policy Institute, a non- 
profit international research group 
based in Washington, D.C. He was 
one of the creators of the Earth Day 
Foundation. 

On April 20, the final installment of 
the Odyssey series will be "The Art 
of Ansel Adams." This leciurc will be 
presented by Sarah Adams, grand- 
daughter of the late photographer. 



IPFW students win 
journalism awards 



By Michael Bass,

Hard work and recognition dove- 
tailed this last weekend for The Com- 
municator. 

Several students from last semes- 
s staff attended the Indiana Colle- 



competition, The Communicator's 
former editorial staff came in fourth 
place out of a total of seven places in 
editorial content for Division II. 

The wiruier of Division II Newspa- 
per of ttic Year was DePauw Univer- 
sity's The DePauw, 40 1/2 points; 
second place- lUPUl's The 
giate Press Association (ICPA) annual Sagamore, 34 points; and third place-

awards banquet Saturday nighi. 

Seven schools, including IPFW, 
competed in the Division II category 
for a non-daily newspaper with an en- 
rollment of over 2,000 

students. 

Joyce Stocks, advertis- 
ing manager and IPFW 
student, blew the com- 
petition away and took 
first place for Division II 
Advertising of the Year 
Award. Slocks amassed a 
total of 23 points to win. 
Her closest competitor, 
lU Northwest's Phoenix

such an honor, but I 
don't do my work with 
that in mind. My job is 
to take good care of our

Professor threatened 



By Jorge Rivera, 

Staff Writer and 

FX. Douse, 

Copy Writer 

When actors walk off stage, diey are 
allowed to leave their roles behind. 
However, for Larry L. Life, associate 
professor of Theatre, the drama con- 
tinues off the stage and into his per- 
sonal life. On March 18, 1993, Life 
found a death ihreai letter in his facul- 
ty mailbox. Once again, he must go 
through the motions in adjusting to a 
letter full of obscenities and hamss- 

"The 'Bent' issue was really the last 
Umc of the overt hate," Life said, re- 
ferring to the firsi time he received a 
death threat in November 1981. for 
his production of "Bent" which dealt 



with the persecution of homosexuals 
by the Nazis during World War 11. 

"Anytime there is a statement that is 
llfc-lhreaiening, you can't ignore it." 
Life said. 

The letter consisted of a critical 
analysis of his performance m "Char- 
lie's Aunt." his sexuality, the process 
of casting his shows, and included the 
threat of toting a gun id any of Life's 
future performances, or assaulting 
him with a pink triangle branding 
iron. 

Life really didn't understand why 
someone would wait two months after 
the production to vmie him a letter. 
By reading the letter, he suspects it is

Asbestos in Neff 
prompts removal 



By Felicia Beeehing, 
Editor in chief 

On Monday morning. Liberty En- 
vironmental Services began remov- 
ing ihc carcinogen, asbestos, from 
five rooms in Neff Hall. Some stu- 
dents and professors arc concerned 
about the safety of the project. 

Frederick Crowley, associate pro- 
fessor of economics and finance, 
was very unhappy with what he has 
seen. 

"There is visquecn (a plastic) 
falling down and this stuff is sup- 
posed to be a banicr against the as- 
bestos," said 
Crowley. 

Jack Dah!, regis- 
trar, explained 
that four music 
rooms and one 
practice music room are having the 
asbestos removed from the ceilings 
and walls. It was sprayed and in- 
stalled 20 years ago for sound- 
proofing. 

'■|i was a common practice back 
then," said Dahl. 

He also said that floor tiles and 
walls will be removed and new 
walls built. Dalil estimated that it 
would take approximately two 
weeks for the project to be com- 
pleted. 

Dahl assured The Communicator 
iliat a licensed contractor is doing 
the work and that the air quality 
is being monitored by Purdue 
University. 

"We are removing the parts (of 
Neff Hall) that need to be removed 
by licensed contractors. Air quality 
will be monitored," said Dahl. 

Donald Katier, director of physi- 
cal plant administration reponcil 
tliat Liberty Environmental Services 
form Clovcrdale, Indiana, has a 
good reputation in the state for haz- 
ardous waste removal. 

Tacky masking tape lettering that 
looks like a nine-year-old child's 
work on the sides of Liberty's vehi- 
cles plants doubts about the profes- 
sionalism of this company to pro- 
tect the safety and health of IPFW's 
students and staff 

Katier reassured that the removal 
of the asbestos is properly super- 
vised by an industrial hygiemst and 
will be disposed of at an approved 
landfill. 

"We're fulfilling all regulations 
and going beyond that to make 
everyone's safety assured," said 
Katter. 

Crowley is not convinced. 

"I'm staying out of Neff until after 
the crews are gone. My students can 
see me in the library. That's where 
I'm having offi 




The asbestos removal project 
will continue for two weeks 
while students study and social- 
ize in the Neff lounge. 



ASBESTOS 



Crowley. 

"I'm concerned about students 
who have to take classes in Neff. If 
they don't think breathing asbestos 
is safe, but their professor docs, 
then they are between a rock and a 
hard place," added Crowley, 

Some classes and labs were 
moved out of the basement in Neff 
Hall on Tuesday, due to the as- 
bestos removal. Several students 
contacted The Communicator to 
complain about the congested air in 
the building. 

Wednesday morning, a group of 
dental hygiene students were asked 
to comment about 
their opinion of the 
air quality in Neff 
this week. 

"It's okay," said 
one student. 

Another said that the day before, 
in the basement of Neff Hal!, class- 
es were cancelled, but Uiat the first 
floor was okay. 

Another student, not with the den- 
tal students, was worried because 
the masking tape let the plastic fall 
down and didn't seal off the area. 

"There was a little boy. about a 
ten-year-old, that was going to 
snoop around where the men were 
working," he said. "There was no 
barrier, and I told him to stay away 
because it was dangerous."

Budget, fees and more 
issues target students 



Today you're going lo read 
about issues, issues, and more 
issuer! 

Firei of all, wc have lo look at 
ihc adminisiraiion's allcmpl lo 
soficn Ihc blow of raising ihc 
siudcnt fees and luilion. With 
the classic selection of Domi- 
no's pizza with every imagin- 
able lopping, and Coke (some 
prefer New York Scllzcr, but 
weren't asked.), a meeting of 
the mind's took place. 

Phil Grolc, comptroller, ex- 
plained the long tedious 
process of getting a budget ap- 
proved. For 
those of you 
who don't 
know what 
we're talking 
about. Icl us 
enlighten 
you, 

IPFW de- 
rives ils bud- 
get from Ihc 
needs of the 



ministration 
sends Ihe 
school's bud- 
get to — yes, 
you guessed 
it— Purdue, 
our moihcr 
school. Ally- 



ing to suffer from slings and 
arrows will be the students of 
IPFW. So, for those of you 
who already have two or three 
jobs, get another one! And for 
those of you who have kids, 
find a cheap babysitter because 
it looks like things around here 
aren't going to change yet. 

Wc must also look at the stu- 
dent participation at last 
week's student affairs forum. 
Now, folks, if you're going to 
complain about somclhing, you 
need to discuss why there were 
only about twenty students at 
e forum 
d not any 




way. Purdue makes the finan- 
cial adjustments they feel arc 
necessary and sends it lo two 
other agencies, respectively. 
The Indiana Commission for 
Higher Educaiion (ICHE) and 
the State Budget Agency arc 
responsible for hacking the 
proposal to pieces, also. After 
it leaves ils last financial cir- 
cumcision, it arrives in the 
State Legislature where some 
more butchering will lake 
place by the House and the 
Senate (Update: By the way. 
remember the House numbers 
art very poor Well, Ihe Senate 
topped them. They proposed 
1.4 million dollars for 1993-94 
and$8.531 for 1994-95,). 

Getting back on the budget 
track, the House and Senate 
make their proposals, which 
are then sent to the conference 
commitiec. After the confer- 
ence committee makes their re- 
visions, the budget is voted on 
by the full legislature. If ii 
passes, good ol' Evan signs his 
John Hancock lo it. 

Now. do you see why ii takes 
local and federal government a 
long time to gel things done? 
They are always passing the 
work 10 someone else for 
approval. 

To fee or not to fee? Whelher 
it is nobler lo remove the cap 
(from the siudent fees) and suf- 
fer Ihe slings and arrows of the 
Quiragcous fonunc.of course 
only the Purdue has all of the 
fonunes. right? 

The only people who arc go- 



nonviolent protest or a sUident 
fomm, lei's show up and voice 
our opinion. 

Another area that needs to be 
addressed is the removal of as- 
bestos from Neff. Don Kailcr, 
arc you going through ihc 
proper pnjcedures in removing 
this harmful material from the 
school. There have been re- 
ports (which is different from 
gossip, folks!) that the air is 
noticeably different and faculty 
and students have been feeling 
a little under the weather due 
to the new adjustments. Let's 
try to gel this situation taken 
care of. okay. Don? 

Now reluming to IPFW on 
April 12th is your friend and 
ours, Steven Bccring, pre- 
side of Purdue and dictator of 
-PFW, 

Becring will hold special 
meetings throughout the day 
with the faculty senate, faculty 
members as a whole, and also 
a meeting wiih students (that is 
noi a misprini!). The only 
caich is you have to be inviied 
to attend the student meeting 
(He has to keep us. the serfs, I 
meant, students of -PFW under 
control somehow.) 

Anyway, if you arc doing 
nothing and have a couple of 
complaints you would like lo 
voice, be al Kettler Hall on 
Monday at 1;30 at the faculty 
meeting with your signs! Lei 
your writing be read!

Letters to the editor 

Visiting history lecturer 
deserves faculty post 



To the Editor: 

Since last week I've fell stunned, 
dismayed, and deeply saddened that 
our Visiting Lecturer, Alexandres Ky- 
rou was not selcncd for (he Depart- 
ment of History position he has served 
for Ihc past two years. My opinion and 
observation.^ about this are expressed 
as a student in two of his classes. 
Balkan history and Byzantine History. 

1 feel strongly thai IPFW students 
deserve lo continue benefiting from 
Professor Kyrou's excellent classroom 
instrucijorL His ejucnsivc knowledge 
of his subject is enhanced by his cre- 
ativity and unique classroom skills. 
His keen ability in making the study of 
history interesting, meaningful and rel- 
evant is made all the more laudatory 
by a commanding eloquence and ani- 
mated enthusiasm that holds his class- 
room spellbound. 

It is clear thai Professor Kyrou has a 
keen interest in education and a gen- 
uine interest in creating an environ- 
ment that IS conducive to learning. His 
insight and interest in the way studcnis 
Icam is clearly seen and felt in his 
classroom. He demands high standards 
and applies fair judgment. He encour- 
ages students to overcome obstacles 
and inspires them to take up the chal- 
lenge of learning more and more. 

Moreover, Professor Kyrou's lec- 
tures arc far more than well-prepared 
conveyances of information. Instead, 



they ate meticulously orchestrated, 
ihoughl-provoking, often humorous, 
vehicles of learning. They provide an 
interesting, meaningful and relevant 
synthesis of past and present. It is this 
crcativi[y that has succeeded in trans- 
forming ordinary academic demands 
into exciting educational challenges. 

While there may be many professors 
of equal ability and motivation to meet 
the high standards of IPFW staff and 
faculty, wc have already seen that Pro- 
fessor Kyrou has superbly demonstrat- 
ed these characteristics, and many 

Profes.sor Kyrou is clearly a strong 
asset to IPFW. His deep commitment 
to educaiion and classroom excellence 
is consistently reflected in his le^aching 
skills and his dcdicaiion to high stan- 
dards. I am deeply concerned that wc 
mighl allow such an important asset to 
be taken for granted and slip through 
our fingers as ihough the loss does not 
mallet. 

It mauets a tot. Wc deserve the op- 
portunity to continue benefiting from 
Professor Kyrou's unique classroom 
skills. He deserves a more appropriate 
recognition for the imponani contribu- 
tions he has made lo the studcnis of 
IPFW, lo the excellent image of IPFW 
staff and faculty, and to the field of 
higher educatioa

Unsigned death threat 
disgusts IPFW student 



To the Editor: 

As ihose of you who saw last 
Wednesday's issue of Ihe Fort Wayne 
News &amp; Sentinel know, a deaih threat 
was anonymously delivered to pro- 
fessor Larry L, Life at his ofHcc in 
Ihc Thcaffc Ans building. 

The threat was couched in the most 
disgusting and nauseating homopho- 
bic rhetoric imaginable and dcmon- 
straicd lo what depths certain mem- 
bers of our society have sunk into 
their cesspool of ignorance and 
hatred. 

It sickens me that there exists not- 
only such maladjusted miscreants 
running loose, bui that these night' 
riders feel almost sanctioned by to- 
day's society to spew forth their vom- 
iious venom on such humanitari artists 
as professor Life. 

Those of us who have come to 
know and love Larry Life are sad- 
dened ihat such a kind, caring, and 
loving huraan being must be victim- 
ized and made to suffer simply be- 
cause he has the courage to openly 
declare his gay pride. 

In Larry's over iweniy years at 
IPFW he has unceasingly devoted 
himself 10 the student body. He has 
been a friend, teacher, couiiselor, fa- 
ther-figure, and role model to thou- 
sands of students whose lives he has 
touched. He has worked coniinually 
for student rights, and his defense of 
First Amendment guarantees is a 
matter of public record. 

Within the world of theatre profes- 



r Life 



ctcd 



throughout the U,S- His willingi 
to risk his own personal safety and 
artistic reputation in order to allow 
students and the ihcaiic-going public 
lo confront and be confronted by new 
ideas through his iheairical produc- 
tions is legendary and has done much 
to earn our Theatre department the 
rcpuiaiion that is so jealously covcled 
by colleges and universilics through- 
out the academic world. 

From Socrates and Jesus Chrisi to 
Martin Luther King. Jr.. and Bobby, 
Kennedy, the. pages of. history arc 
filled with the names of men and 
Wometi'wTio Have risked, ifnot'given, 
their lives for speaking out against in- 
justice and living their lives consis- 
tent with their philosophies. To those 
pages can be added the name of Larry 
L. Life. 

Larry, the lisi of siudcnis alone who 
owe you and love you number in the 
thousands. And for all those students 
who would if ihey could, 1 publicly 
and un-ashamedly say that wc love 
you. And if being gay has. in some 
way. contributed to your philosophy 
of human compassion, then I 
feel somehow cheated by my 
h etc rose xuality. 

Thank you for all that you have giv- 
en so many and know that our hearts 
go out to you will not fight Ihe good 
fight alone,

Writer gives suggestions on how to prolong one's life 



By Nalhan Somers 
SlafT Writer 

Have you ever wished you had an 
CKira hour each day? Ate you con- 
cerned about dying 30 or dO years 
from now? Well, you don'i have lo 
be a slave of limc any longcrt This

indefinitely, using only common 
foodlikc producls. supersonic jcis. 
spacccrafi, and leiieis lo your con- 
gressperson. But, first, lei's address 
some common queries about tempo- 
ral engineering. 

Why would 1 wan! to live forev- 
er? Well, if you have to ask, maybe 
you shouldn't bother irying. But 
Ihcre aie many advaniages. Some 
have speculated ihai if our lives were 
indenniic or at least longer, human 
life mighi mean more lo people. By 
the time wc die at around age 78. we 
have onJy used a small percentage of 
our brainspace. But if we filled our 
minds with ccniuries of experience, 
and if our lives were of more value, 
humanity might reach a higher level 
of existence. And if that Carl Sagan 
crap doesn't appeal lo you, think of 
all ihe money you could make. To 
find out if immortality is right for

How can I prolong my lifespan

every month. Ore month, oai bran is 
good for you, the next month it caus- 
es cancer. But you always know 
where you stand with junlcfood. For 
example, ihe much-maligned Twitikic 
is probably the only manmadc object 
impervious to the effects of lime. 
You can share in the Twinkic's tem- 
poral stasis by eating two or three a 
day. It's a fact that a regular diet of 
preservative -laden Twinkics can keep 
your body young, fresh, and smelling 
great even years afier your death. 

Inorganic "chec/es" such as E-Z 
Cheese, Velveeia. and Cheese Whiz 
are some of the greatest elixirs of im- 
morialily. Observe what happens 
when you leave some chccze out in 
ihc sun for a day — it produces the 
same light, durable plastic used in Ihe 
bodies of Poniiac Ficros. When you 
cat a slab of Velveeta, you are not on-

are digesting harmful petroleum by-

the environment. E-Z Cheese also 
makes a great shark repellent. 

How can I use the worldwide time 
/ones to my advantage? It's much 
easier than you might ihink. First, 
you can use ihe money you saved by 
only buying cheap Twinkles and 
Checze products lo purchase a super- 
sonic jet. If that still isn't enough, 1 
would check out die prices at the So- 
viet Union's going-oui-of-busincss 
sale. Once you have your jet, you 
can use ii to literally fly circles 
around the world's lime zones, which 
lumber along at a sluggish 600-800 
m.pJi. Every time you cross die In- 
ternational Dale Line is like passing 
Go in Monopoly, except you add a 
day to your life. 

What about space travel? Ac- 
cording 10 Einstein's theory of Rela- 
tivity, time passes faster for a station- 
ary object than it docs for an object in 
motion. If you can travel ihrough 
space near light speed, time on Earth 



will pass much more quickly. Some 
people may think this is kind of 
pointless because it won't really pro- 
long your life, but you'll have the last 
laugh on ihem when you land back at 
Eardi. satisfied diat you spent a year 
in space and everyone you knew is 
dead. Of course, not everyone can 
gel their hands on a rocket that can 
travel 500.000 miles per second or 
more. If you can'l, then rush around 
everywhere as close to light speed as 
you manage. You can save time and 
money by making your own speedy 
Fiero oul of E-Z Cheese. 

Why doesn't the government cre- 
ate more efficient time systems? 
Because government doesn't work 
unless you lobby fiercely. People al- 
ways ask, "Why don'i we just prim 
more money to pay off the naiional 
debt?" This idea could apply to 
many diings, including lime. Howev- 
er, our idioiic politicians, failing lo 
recognize the genius of diis solution. 



often pooh-pooh the idea. But poll- 
lies is all about compromise. Re- 
member when congress wanicd all of 
us lo Icam the metric system just be- 
cause the English sysicm is obsolete. 
nonsensical, and not even used by the 
English anymore? What if we turned 
that legislation against congress and 
demanded a decimalized time sys- 
tem? Imagine how much easier our 
lives would be if there were 10 min- 
utes in an hour. 10 hours in a day, 10 
months in a year, eic. Our lifespans 
would increase to thousands of meiric 
years. 



You can combine all these lech- 
niques into a daily time-saving rou- 
tine. Start off with a healthy break- 
fast of Jolt Cola. 6 eggs (just Ihe 
yolks), bacon with Checze dip, and a 
TWinkic. Rush out to ihe airport in 
your Checicd-up Fiero. take a couple 
of laps around die tniemalional Daic 
Line in your surplus MIG jei, ihcn 
rush back home lo wriie more leticrs 
10 your congrcssperson. I'm sure 
you'll agree that ii's lime well spent.

Ficc piz.7.a and soda accompanied a 
panel discussion between school ad- 
minisiralors and siudcnls at the IPFW 
Siudcnc Affairs Forum hojied by ihe 
Student Senate at Walb Mcmoiial 
Union on April I. 

According lo Rajit Suri. Siudeni 
Body president, the for\jm is an infor- 
mational session between administra- 
tion and students on issues that affect 
IPFW. Discussed topics were the fiscal 
budget for 1993-95 and computer sys- 
tems at IPFW. 

Panel members leptesenling the uni- 
versity fldminisiraiion were; Bill Baden. 
VAX systems manager. Jack Dahl, as- 
sociate vice chancellor of planning: Bill 
Frederick, associate professor of com- 
puter science: Phil Giote. IPFW comp' 
Holier; and Walter Branson, vice chan- 
cellor of Gnancial affaira. Student Sen- 
ate members in the panel were Mike 
Heit. Jerry' Richardson and Chris 

Groie described where and how IPFW 
ftceived its monies and the process of 
requesting funds from ihc stale. He said 
stale appropriations provide approxi- 
mately 50?o of ihc school budget and 
student fees supply the rcsL 

The state's current pioor economy ad- 
versely affects funding that IPFW re- 
ceives, forcing administrators to raise 
student fees. 

The panel estimoied ihal an increase 
in student fees anywhere from 4-10 per- 
cent is probable. Student benefits from 
these increased fees would include up- 
graded computer facilities, expansion 
of computer availability, and the ability 
to hire additional faculty. 



"There is a certain point at which peo- 
ple will be unable to attend, but the 
school has to be committed to meeting 
the minimum needs of its students." 
Giotc said. 

A student orgajiiiation, the Associa- 
tion for Computing Machinery, hopes 
to integrate the Internet and E-mail sys- 
tems into IPFWs computets- 

Appronimatcly 20 students attended 
the forum. Junior Angie Rakcstraw stat- 
ed "I was disappointed about the sru- 
dcnt tumoui. and the panel answers 
were not very definite." 

Vertise Suggs, a sophomore, is one of 
the students who might be affected by a 
fee increase. "1 gel Hnancial aid now. 
and if fees aic increased I might not be 
able to afford it." 

According to freshman Andy Gott- 
fried."! plan to attenil more discussions, 
but I think they will be threatened 
by not enough student participation."

Chief Reporter 

Found in north ccnliol Indiana: rqililc 
fossil prints, a distant ancestor lo the di- 
nosaur, are preserved in 290 million 
year old Pcnnsylvonian lock. 

Geologist Erik Kvalc, with the Indi- 
ana Geological Survey located on lU's 
campus, organized the trip lo north cen- 
tral Indiana where Ihc fossil prints were 
found. Kvalc, the only geologists in the 
party of six, did not however find ihe 
trackway. 

"I organized the trip to the area with 
palcomologisi Joe Dcvera from the Illi- 
nois Slaic Geological Survey and four 
.buddies." Kvalc explained. "Charles 
Sinn Jr. who runs a computer service 
business aciually found Ihcm." 

What was found were molds of the 
prints that conslinitc ihc trackway. 

"This animal walked along Ihc coast- 
line. The coast was in Illinois." said 
Kvalc. "The reptile tracks aic preserved 
in sand not mud. The prims were in 
mud, Ihc muddy Hal dried. A layer of 
sand buried |ihc prints. |" 

The layer of sand became sandstone 
making a mold of ihc prints. 

'The Pcnnsylvanian Age, 290 million 
years ago, was a period of lime when 
coals were forming in the Eastern U.S. 
Indiana was located close to the equa- 
tor." said Kvalc. "early Pennsylvanian 
is Ihc lime when reptiles were just 
evolving." 

The replilc is a Diapsid. a group of 
primilivc reptiles ihat lived and was 
evolved before dinosaurs, crocodiles, 
Itinlcs, reptiles, snakes and birds. The 
size of the animal is estimated at 12 
inches. 

"This is the second sci of trackways 
found in the lasi 150 years." said Kvalc, 
"ihesc are rare fossils,"

Coach upbeat 

by Quentin Spiegel 
Sla IT Writer 



The IPFW men's baseball icam is 
improved over last year's learn, al- 
though their record doesn't show it. 

The icarn. t-7 in conference, is "one 
inning away from being .500 in ihc 
league. Take that inning away and 
we're compciiiivc!" stated Matt Kinz- 
cr, IPFWs head baseball coach. 

On Monday, the icam dropped both 
games of a double header to Lewis 
University. 

Rob Millcdgc stoned on the mound 
for the 'Dons in die first game: Wade 
Stuchey sianed pitching in the second 
game. 

Mati Leininger was a strong offen- 
sive weapon for the 'Dons, hitting 4 
for 8. 

The players truly believe that if dicy 
cannot improve their performance this 
year, the youth on the team will pre- 
vail In future years. 

Brett Raicliffe, an IPFW player, 
said, "We are a young team. We just 
need to put one whole game together, 
then be consistent." 

The IPFW baseball team has been 
compared to the IPFW volleyball 
team in that both siancd out young 
and with a losing record. 

Coach Kinzcr hopes his team will 
make strides, similar to that of the 
volleyball team, in an effon to give 
IPFW some baseball respect among 
the league. 

The team plays away this weekend 
at Bellarminc and Kentucky State,

Q. You said you can't

restaurants, but what if 
you liave a cut (n your 
mouth? Couldn't the 
virus get into the body 
that way? 

A. Theoreiicaily. yes, but 
where would the virus 
come from? Restaurants 
wash their silverware, 
dishes, and glassware and 
the virus, which is very 
fragile, would be killed.

Lady 'Dons win doubleheader 



By Quentin Spiegel 
Staff Writer 

Add two more victories to the Lady 
'Don's Softball record, bringing the 
total to 16. 

IPFW continued dieir winning ways 
in a double-header victory over Man- 
chester last week. 

TTie first game of the double header 
set the tone for the second game as 
the 'Don's recorded two "schniede" or 
shutout victories, 5-0. 11-0. 

The 'Don's defense shut down all 
the plays attempted by the offense. 



Angle Quickcry Uirew thirteen strike- 
outs in tlie first game allowing one hit. 

Quickery also pitched a threc-hil 
shutout as the 'Dons up their record. 

Defense was again noted as the key 
to the 'Don's success. 

Hitting well for the 'Dons was 
Dawn Freeman, who belted a shot to 
the fence during the second game. 

Freeman was joined by Michelle 
Volz and Liz Caywood in providing 
much of the offense for the team. 

Looking at the team's offensive stats 
through 17 games, Dawn Freeman 
leads the 'Don's hitting .469 with 15 



hits and 14 runs batted in, 

Liz Caywood adds to the offense, 
hitting .457 with 16 hits. 

Kim McDonald leads the 'Don's in 
stolen bases at 9, followed closely 
by Michelle Volz (8) and Rhonda 
Colone (7). 

Michelle Conley, first base and out- 
fielder, commented on the altitude of 
the team by saying, "The difference 
between this year and last year is that 
we want to win." 

The 'Dons are certainly winning and 
plan to put their 11 game win streak 
on the line Friday against Tri-State.

nancial and academic autonomy

image problems here [at IPFWj."

Artist designs award 



Jo Ann Sleinfonh 
Staff Writer 

Hector Garcia. IPFW associate 
professor of Fine Arts, has de- 
signed an original sculpture entitled 
"VcloSpirii", to be awarded annual- 
ly to the winner of the Tour de 
France. 

Garcia was commissioned by 
VcloNcws Publications of Boulder. 
Colorado to create a sculpture that 
honors top American and European 
athletes in the world of competitive 
cycling. 

It was natural for Garcia to design 
a work thai combines his chosen art 
form and his love of cycling. He 
was one of the founders of the 
Three Rivers Velo Sport Club 
iwenty-iwo years ago. Also, he 
rides 30 miles every other day and 
tours with several national and in- 
ternational louts each year. 

"It was a nice combination. " ex- 
plained Garcia. 

The sculpture he designed stands 
20 inches and the base is solid red 
oak. Its appearance is similar lo al- 
abaster. The large one weighs be- 



tM ccn 1 8 and 20 pounds. 

VetoNews has long desired to prc- 
scni a prestigious annual award to 
professional cyclists. 

Miguel Indurain of Spain will be 
the first recipient of Carcia's 
award. Indurain won the 1992 Tour 
de France. 

The Tour de France season begins 
in Europe in March and runs 
through the middle of October. 

"It is iweniy-one days of intense 
racing through the Alps and can be 
an eniremely demanding spoti." 
said Garcia. 

Cyclist's reach up to 55 mph 
down the mountainsides and 30 
mph on flat terrain, Before the rac- 
ing season begins, a cyclist may log 
up to 4.(KX) kilometers on their 20 
lb bike. During the winter, profes- 
sional racers will include weight 
training, crossing country and run- 
ning. 

Garcia encourages anyone to try 
louring since it provides an excel- 
icni way to Stay in shape. "Ii is a 
non-siressful way to exercise. 

"Ii is a sport that you can do all 
your life." said Garcia. 



Threat 

continued from page 1 

pointed fornot being cast in his play. 

"In the iwcniy-thrcc years that 1 
have been here and as far as the way I 
live my life. I will not allow any dis- 
crimination against mc or anyone else 
because of sexual orieniaiion." said 
Life- 

"I fee) that it is my responsibility to 
say to the Fort Wayne community at 
large that this is not something that I 
will ignore or will take lightly and I 
feel I can speak for the other mem- 
bers of the gay community in Fort 
Wayne," Life added. 

Life came forward with this infor- 
mation because he fell the letter 
can be used as an effective tool in 
telling the students, faculty, and ad- 
ministration that harassment based on 
one's sexuality will not be tolerated 
anywhere. 

"I can honestly say that every time 
it has happened, it hurts more than 



anything. Ignorance makes me angry. 
Stupidity and bigooy makes mc an- 
gry. Bui. I don't want to combat il 
with hatred. I'm a pacilisi." said Life. 

Life advised that the person, whocv. 
cr it is. to stck professional help. Al- 
so, he has turned the letter over to 
IPFW Police and discussed the issue 
wiih Donna Middlcton, afTirmaiive 
action officer. 

"I am and always have been very 
visible as a gay member of this com- 
munity, both the academic conununi- 
ly and tlie Fort Wayne conununiiy. I 
am very proud of being gay. All my 
siudcnu know. So. as in terms of my 
gay pride. I fell it was something I 
could not ignore." said Life. "You 
don't fighi hate with hate,"
