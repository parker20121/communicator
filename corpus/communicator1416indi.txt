Kenworthy: Recession 
causes 1.8 percent 
increase in enrollment 



By LOKRI MOOG 

BUfr Writer 

An allilme high enrollment resulted 
from IPFW's spring registration. Last 
year at this lime. 9,572 students were 
attending spring semester classes. 
That number has increased 18 percent 
as 9,746 ere attending 1983 spring 
itmi."-rtT iJ.i-.-r*. ^.illi undergraduate

academic services 

Kenworthy said he attributes the 
rising Interest In education to the 
recession and expects final figures to 

and inner-campus transfers. 

"The university docs well in bad 
times became people think an ' 
education may prevent them from 
f-eiiing l.inl ufi from their next job," 
Kenworthy said 

"People arc setting education at a 
higher priority and are willing to 
conlribulo a shrinking dollar pool to

Some students con no longer alford

expensive, many students can com-

Job Locator Service 
planning Camp Fair 

By MIKE DEE 
Staff Writer 

Although it is still winter, many students ore thinking ahead to finding 

rmmer employment. The IPFW Camp Fair Day has been set up to help 
sluoVnlsm Iheir search. 

"Wir think the job market will be extremely light this summer and it's another 
■ay for students to find employment." Anne Hoover, coordinator of the Job 
ocalirm Service said. 

The fair Is co-sponsored by both the Job Location Service, a referral service 
fur ll'KV. student* -it king part-time jobs and by the athletic department 

The Camp Fair Day is an outgrowth of the Jobs Fair and for this year, the 
decision was made to separate them Into two events. The Camp Fair Day will be 
Feb 9 In the Wolb Memorial Union Ballroom from 9 n.m lo 3p.m. 

During the fair, students will be able to talk with representatives from camps 
and other organizations for summer employment. Organizations sending 
representatives arc those from New Hampshire and Massachusetts, as well as 
■ i.'v it .i 1 1 n i m India nil a nd surrounding States. 

The lengths of the Jobs range from sessions lasting a part of the summer to 
i-mpluyiismi Im Die iTiiirc- summer Nut all of those represented are what might 
be considered the traditional camps. The Historic Old Fort will be represented 
along with a group Irom the West Central Neighborhood In Fort Wayne. 

The salary of the students working for the summer organizations does vary. 
But there are other benefits from the Jobs. Donna Koehllnger, a secretary ol the 
Jobs Location Service said, "The experience and (he references are, I think In 
this case, more Important than the pay ." 

The lair will be an Informal event wilh students coming in to investigate 
different organizations Koehlinger said there is a need for volunteers to help 
during the Camp Fair as hosts and host esses Anyone interested in volunteering 
may contact the Jobs Location Service. 



; for a well-rounded 
personality were the quickest to fill 
this semester, Kenworthy said. 

"The classes which closed first were 
business, technology and computer 
classes," hesaid. 

These were followed by classes 
which. Kenworthy said, "make you a 
belter person Sociology, psychology, 
philosophy and history were popular 

Although the undergraduate 
population grew, graduate enrollment 
dropped H 6 percent, and Kenworthy 
attributed this decline lo factors Ifi- 
vnlvinc llu- school ol education. 

"A lot of the graduate work Is done 
here in education. New teachers ore 
laid of! and doing other things Older 
teachers already have their licenses. 
So neither group reels the need for 
more education There is also a 
decline in Ihe need for teachers. The 
loss of accreditation in that depart- 
ment may also hate something to do 
with the decline." Kenworthy said. 

A slight decline in graduate school 
enrollment is being seen nationwide, 
Kenworthy said. Some institulions 
face as much as a four percent drop. 

A 23 percent decline in registration 
also occurred in the undergraduate 
non-degree population, Kenworthy 

"This is probably down because non- 
degree sludcnls can no longer get 
financial aid. A lot of them decided lo 
pick a major real quick." Kenworthy 

Not all of the regional colleges are 
benefiting from the recession, 
however. Manchester College has seen 
a decrease ol nearly ten percent in 
enrollment, said its associate 
academic dean, Carl Calwell. 

"We attribute this to the economic 
situation and to the influence of IPFW 
and other regional campuses." he 

If Manchester would benefit from a 
rising economy, Kenworthy said, 3

Shut-off valves being installed 



Mall construction to prevent flooding 



By MARY LOUISE LOVE 
Staff Writer 

Twenty foot holes will be dug In Ihe 
mall area between Ihe Walb Memorial 
Union and the Classroom 4 Medical 
Building over ihe next few months The 
holes will be used to install shut-off 
valves in three manholes as part of a 
flood prevention plan implemented hy 
IPFW officials. 

"Lsl March, 30 inches of water 
covered Ihe ground floor of the union 
building i during the flood). A couple ol 
Inches were In the basemen! of the 
library. We were helpless," said Don 
Kaller, director of the physical plant. 

The Walb Memorial Union and 



lielmke Library received the greatest 
damage from the flood. 

The culvert near Ihe lagoon contains 
a 2A inch line which serves as Ihe main 
drain for the north end of Ihe campus 
The culvert and storm sewer flow 
directly beneath the mall 

Kalter explained that the Unlan and 
the Library were constructed with the 
1913 flood in mind. 

"The question arises: Why weren't 
ihey (Hood control projects) put in 
when the building was built? The 
buildings are two leet above the 1913 
flood level, and this is according lo Ihe 
guidelines Ihen," Kalter said. The SI. 
Joe River crested back then, and last 
year the water was about five feet 



design standards In effect for this 

Anolher aspect in thcprojccl. he said, 
is that plans musl be made lo carry- 
away sewage waste. Pumps will be 
operating al manholes lo pump Ihe 
waste upstream, past Ulc valves, down 
into the next manhole Then. Ihe waste 
will U'iiiddt In flow into the river. 

"There will he some inconvenience, " 
Katter said, "but this will prevent 
closing down classes should anolher 
flood emergency arise." The project 
will be completed by late spring or 



early summer and manhole co

The project is being financed jointly

"The damages from the flood ap- 
proached a quarter ol a million dollars. 
The formula (used by Ihe government! 
allows for a percentage to be

the future," Carnaghi said.

Orr aiding education? 



Student speaks against program 



Governor Robert D. Orr recently 
outlined a S12 million plan to upgrade 
public education. The plan contained 
some good points, but (here are a few 
details the Governor should consider. 

His plan calls for Increasing the school 
year from a minimum of 175 days to 180; 
purchasing computers and software lo 
teach skills lo pupils and train 10,000 
teachers In computer instruction; and 
allowing teachers to work off up lo 
110,000 in college loans — $2,000 a year — 
by teaching math and science in public 
schools. Orr's plan also involves 
providing extra money to retrain 
teachers In math and science areas. 

In summary, Orr's plan means more 
education. This is good, nol only for the 
students' welfare, but also for colleges 
and universities became II makes It 
easier for them to ieacb an already well- 
educated and disciplined student. 

Governor Orr, however, had better 
make sure money is available to pay 
teachers for working those extra five 
days Good teachers are hard lo come 
by. They may not stick around if they 
are not rewarded for trying to help guide 
today's students. 

John R. Hammond, Orr's executive 
assistant, said Orr's S12 million package 
currently does not include money to pay 
teachers for the extra five days. 

By purchasing computer equipment to 
teach skills lostudents and teachers, Orr 
is helping improve the stale's economy. 
More Jobs could become available if 
computer and high technology firms 



to Indiana. An 
pule r-educa led students in this area 
could attracl such firms. 

But even though an education in 
computer technology could help the 
state, Orr must make sure public 
education in Indiana does not become 
too one-sided. If loo much emphasis is 
placed on computer technology, math 
and other sciences, students will miss 
out on other Important subjects like 
history, English, grammar and social 
studies. Computer technology may be 
practical, but other subjects are needed 
to make an education truly well' 
rounded. 

Allowing teachers to work off college 
loans by teaching math and science and 
providing extra money to teachers to 
remain in those areas could cause a 
shortage of teachers In other subjects 
because there may not be any incentives 
for Ihem. 

Stewart Spencer, executive editor of 
the News-Sentinel, told The Com- 
municator, "In my experience here and 
one other place, people coming out of 
college are nol equipped with basic 
English skills. They can't spell well. 
They can't write well." 

We are not saying the public school 
system in Indiana caused the situation 
Spencer described. But an increase in 
English requirements, as well as those 
in other subjects, could solve problems 
similar to his description. 

Moreeducationisagoodidea, bullet's 
make sure it is properly taught. 




BUT WHY*, Ifl HAY A5K, DO WE NEED 
SHUT-OFF WUVES?" 



To the edjlor ; 

I would publicly like to 
Uunk the sociology and 
anthropology department for 
its recent departmental 
decision nol lo participate In 
the new honors program at 
IPFW. I feel it commendable 
and honorable for the 
sociology and anthropology 
department to publicly stale 
its opposition thereby 
initialing discussion and 
debate concerning the issue 

I personally and 
philosophically agree with 
the sociology and an- 
thropology department's 
belief that an honors 
program would 

systematically steer 
students in or oul of honors 
classes based upon per- 
ceived abilities reached by 

I philosophically can nol 

program which ranks 



categories as "gifted " and 
-gifted." 



Should 



students do not test 
capabilities, but ire 
their knowledge 



r university's 

benefit all students then they 
should merely encourage 
that all classes taught at 
IPFW be ol an honorable 



Thus when these 
achievement tests are used 
to distinguish between 
"gifted" and "non-gifted" 
students they result In a 
discrimination against 
anyone nol a while middle- 
class male person. 

I personally object to the 



participant in (he honors 
program of another 

honors program did nol 
benefit all students, asll was 
intended to. Rather, It fur- 
ther divided the student

Hours benefit all students 



Located in the basement of Ihe Walb 
Memorial Union is The Fori cafeteria. 
Operated by ARA Services, The Fort 
sells hot lunches and breakfasts lo 
members of the IPFW community. 

For the next lour weeks. The Fort will 
operate on extended hours. It will now be 
open until 7:30 p.m The Communicator 
is glad losee the cafeteria stay openlhal 
late. 

While many students are only on 
campus during the day, a good number 
of students are here in laic afternoon and 
early evening. These are the people who, 
in the past, either had lo go home be- 



tween classes lo eat, eat somewhere off 
campus or wail and eat late in the 
evening when classes are over. 

We realize the Walb Memorial Union 
is not in a convenient location when a 
student has all classes at Keltler Hall. 
But it is more convenient than driving 
off campus someplace, then driving 
back to IPFW and looking for another 
parking place 

We hope The Fort remains open on its 
current extended schedule long after the 
trial period is over, and that members of 
the community support the cafeteria so 
it will stay open.
