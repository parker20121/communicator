opinion 



Administration made 
decision too late 



Last Sunday, Jan. 2», during Ihe early 
morning houn. Allen County, along wilh 
other ■urroundlng counties, wai hit with 
the worst snow storm since Ihc "Bill- 
iard of '78." 

Snow emergencies were declared In 
Fort Wayne and Allen County before II 
a.m. Sunday. The administration of 
IPFW wisely made the decision lo close 
classes for Monday; however, not until 
5:iS that evening. 

Allhoudh IPFW made the rfghl 
decision to close school for Monday, The 
Communicator lecli the administration 
made that decision loo late In the 
evening. 

H Ml evident at noon on Sunday, alter 
the snow emergencies were declared 
and all major roads were closed, that Ihe 
storm passing through was not a typical 
winter storm that drops three to six 
inches of snow, but one that had dropped 
It Inches In Allen County and close to 15 
or 10 in other surrounding counties. 

II wa« evident that school was going to 
be closed. Why did It take the ad- 
ministration until 5:45 p.m. to close 
classes for Monday? 

Many students were trying to plow 
themselves and their families out. 
especially those students living In rural 
Allen County or outside Allen County. 
Allen County snow plows usually do not 
reach all country roads as fast as the 
Fort Wayne plows reach, the city roads 
because they have a much broader area 
lo cover. 

Studying was not al the lop of students' 
lists of things lo do during the storm 
because Ihcy wcrr digging themselves 



out. They shoe 



e had lo worry 
about whether or not scnool was going lo 
be closed at 5:30 In the evening. 

Monday marked the second day of Ihc 
semester that IPFW had cancelled 
weekday classes. The Communicator 
feels both these decisions were wise 

11 has been evident throughout the 
years IPFW has enisled, that the ad- 
ministration has tried to keep IPFW 
classes In session despite the fact area 
high schools close more often lhan IPF- 

The Communicator also agrees with 
this policy. A College student Is a dif- 
ferent lype of breed than a high school 
student. 

College students have the respon- 
sibility nf completing an education and 
they lake ll seriously. IPFW Is making 
sure they get their money's worth by 
trying to provide a quality education and 
staying open as much as possible. 

There are limes when radio an- 
nouncers will broadcast current wealher 
conditions. They have been known lo 
say, "Currently, we have 2G degrees and 
sunshine," when. In fact, it Is snowing 

The announcer was doing his Job right 
because he read what his copy said bul 
he failed to just simply look out the 
window. 

The administration was doing Its Job 
right. Bul this lime. Mother Nature weni 
on a rampage, ft should not have taken 
Ihe administration until 5:45 lo close 
school. All It had to do was look out the 
window.

Mayor Wlnfield Mosei 
al tended a [ 






trouble, thai would probably possible 
force Ihe club lo terminate 
Ihe remainder of the 1931-62 
season. Af ler 30 years in Die 
IHL, the Komets were 



in Fori Wayne. 
Why after 30 years in Ihe 
IL have the Komets fallen 
to a debl riddt-n Mluatinn? 




The unhealthy economic 
siluation in Fort Wayne has 
dropped the K's average 
game attendance to 2, TOO 
fans. Thai's almost 1,000 
paying customers below Ihc 
estimated break-even point 
for the organization 

It was only three years ago 
when the Komets averaged 
over 4,000 spectators a 
game. Businesses moving 
out of Fort Wayne and major 
layoffs al local lirms have 
made Komel hockey games 
a luxury lo most people in 
the city. 

Two meelings were held at
