said. 

Williams' violations included too many 
unreponed lelcphone calls per week to

He also received a formal letter of repri-

Surviving 
sexual assault 



By Susan Spindler 
News Editor 



This Saturday evening the 
Women's Studies Program at 
IPFW will present a multi-media 
performance, "A Safe Place Re- 
Membered." in Neff Hall Rm. 101 
at 7 p.m. The performance is a rep- 
resentative of a journey to bealing 
and is associated with the 1997 
Annual Survivor's Right Event 

The performance uses visual 
art. language, masks, installation, 
stick fighting, percussion, move- 
ment and theater to repr&amp;seni the 
transformation from trauma to 
empowerment 

The piece is co-creaied by 
independent artists Lucianna and 
AlUson Ballard with the assistance 
of the Fori Wayne Dance 
Collective. The production first 
came to the Fort Wayne Dance 
Collective's Choreographer's 
Laboratory m November 1996. 

The audience feedback was 
extraordinary being descnbcd as "a 
healing ritual" . "powerful and 
personal" "dark and complex" 
... "1 100 am restored, re-bodied in 
joy." 

"We hope and expect that the 
audience connects on an emotional 
level." said Ballard. 

"There is a message of empow- 
erment, the potential for life trans- 
formation, regardless of trauma" 

The performance is open lo all 
There is no need to be a survivor of 
sexual assault. It can be a learning 
and enlightening experience for 
everyone that attends despite histo- 
ry, age and gender Although, it is 
intended for mature audiences only 
and viewer discretion is advised. 



'Thus is nni passive audience 
participaLon." said Billiard. 'The 
audience doesn't actually take pari 
in the performance, but they arc not 
being entertained." 

Ai the end of the performance 
there will be a panel of profession- 
al therapists to aid with a discus- 
sion, followed by a speak -out open 
mike to the pubhc which will allow 
for comments, stories and realiza- 
tions In conjunction with Ibis there 
will be a second workshop on Oct. 
4 at the Fort Wayne's Women's 
Bureau, from 8 a.m. lo 11:45 am 
It IS free and includes breakfast. 

"There will be three separate 
workshops on Saturday: journal mg 
your way to healing, healing 
ibrougb an therapy and expressive 
movement, " said Linda Fox. direc- 
tor of Women's Studies, "The per- 
formance can be very emotional 1( 
can be a release for many survivors 
of sexual assault That is why we 
specifically designed the perfor- 
mance to be followed by discus- 
sions and the workshops on 
Saturday. Oct, 4," 

The community co-sponsors 
for the 9ih annual Survivor Rights 
event include the Fort Wayne 
Women's Bureau, Fori Wayne 
Dance Collective. Samaritan 
Center. Mending Hearu Bookstore 
and Whitington Homes

Ivins speaks on campus 



By Carmen Robinson 
Managing Editor 



On Sept,, 17, 1997. political columnist Molly 
Ivins spoke on issues such as political olTice cam- 
paign finance reform, 

Ivins had worked as a journalist for the New 
York Times and covered such issues as Civil 
Rights and the Vietnam Conflici," 

"Having been involved in the Civil Rights 
movement gave me hope for how things can 
change," said Ivins. Another issue Wins has iden- 
tified with IS the women's movement. She 
became intercsied in the movement when she 
was working at the Minneapolis Tribune. 

Ivms wrote two books entitled, "Molly Ivins 
Can't Say That. Can She?" and "Nothing But 
Good times Ahead," Ivins describes the conieni 
of both as collections of news articles and topics 
she had covered as a journalist. 

"I like to recycle Ihe old stuff," said Ivins. 

Ivins had strong opinions on the future for 
mmonties or women to enter the While House as 
President Ivins said she believed the possibility 
of having a minoniy or woman as President 
would be possible dunng her hfetime, but Ivins 
would nol disclose her pick for a minority 
Presidential candidate. 

"1 don't see anyone righi now because what 
we don't have as a gender is bench strength. 
There is still a small percentage of women in 
Slate legislatures," said Ivins. 

Ivins recalled earlier attempts for a minonty 
who sought the presidency and was disappointed 
with the result 

"Colin Powel's wife was terrified thai he 
would have been assassinated 1 do think that 
racism is still a problem here." said Ivins 

Ivins spoke openly about her strong resena- 
(ions concerning her loyally to the current 
E)emocralic Parly Ivins also discussed the cur- 
rent backlash against the Democratic Pany and 
President Clinton 

"I am a great believer in democracy. Today's 
government consists of special interests running 
special interests, " she said, 

Ivins said she was certain that the Democratic 
Party had received scrutiny from special interests 
and from certain members of the Republican 
Party. Ivins. however was not blind to the allega- 
tions of Paula lones sexual harassment suit 
against the President. 

Ivins was in favor of Jones' right to pursue 
the prosecution of the President, however, she 



remains sympaihe 
the general treatment of 
the Dcmoaaiic Pany as 
a whole, 

"There is a 'Hate 
Clinion Machine' in this 
country. 1 don't recall 
this kind of political 
apparatus set up to 
destroy a President," 
S2ud Ivins. 

"The press core has 
done and enormous dis- 
service here. And when 
in fact Ibey go in to look 
at the actions of the 
president, there is noth- 
ing there," she said, 

"People are so fed 
up with poliiicians 
soundiilg like every- 
body," added Ivins. 

George Owell was 
one of Ivin's inspira- 
tions for pursuing a 
career m journalism 

Writers similar lo 
Orwell influenced Ivins 
along with others who 
wrote about 

Communism and its 
abuses 

Ivins supports the 
efforts of college stu- 
dents who are studying 
journalism 

The journalism stu- 
dents Ivins bad worked 
with were interested in 
ethics. They were not 
eager to make brash 
career moves, such as 
transferring to other 
cities According lo 
Ivms. the students of 
the X generation were 
accustomed lo witness- 
ing human struggles. 



"They were not shocked at Ihe experiences I 
had expressed. They had that all figured ouC 
Ivms said. 

Ivins also urges today's journalists lo follow 
every path and nol exclude what is vital to eover- 




Lasl Wednesday. Ivms spoke on Ihe politics of the country. 



"I'm concerned about what isn't being written 
It's what we miss. We have a splitting country." 
said Ivins, 

Ivins claims journalists must put pieces of 
reality together so that the public may see a 
broader picture.

thousands of dol-

may not be com- ^^^^^^^^^

but accepting donations from indi-

Raising money within the borders of

Senator John Glenn iDem -

Republicans to criticize the alleged

"It's so sanctimonious." Glenn 
said staung that all of bis Senate col- 
leagues routinely invited wealdiy 
supporters to lunch in their office 
with die intention of accepting dona-

What IS the difference if the 
DemociaL'i hold formal events and 
the Republicans hold pnvate meet- 
iDgs in theu" offices to gather money 
fCT political causes. The only differ- 
ence is thai the Republicans seem to

How easily the public forgets

dare we say. morality Right, It's not 
important. The fact is that none of

have been taxed and there is no rea- 
son why they should be 

Now the nation's eyes and ears

record of treating its citizens We 
don't beheve Chnton should accept 
money from anywhere other than 
from the United States, This action 
IS a direct violation of all of our 



rights as US ( 



How can It be 
possible for a 
President to be 

patriotic and 

supportive of two 

different countries 

at once? 



ns because these 
secret dealings 
jeopardize the 
country's effort 
to promote

than suck u out from other countries 
whom we compete with on the inier- 
naiional market? Clinton could have 
found enough green here. Why 
would the Democraiic Party support 
any other cause than an American 
one if indeed it is the ruling party? 
How can it be possible for a 
Presideni lo be patriotic and sup- 
portive of two different countries ai 
once? That is impossible. So in the 
future when the retail market is 
flooded with more products made 
by children and slave labor in Cbma 
and funded by Nike, we'll know 

The beat really comes off of for- 
eign donations received by the 
Democratic National Committee 
from Chinese wealthy busmessmen. 
No one really knows what conspired 
between the President and what 
these individuals have done behind 
closed doors. 

Despite this telling event we are 
still supportive of the DemocraUc 
Party 'There is no way lo tell 
whether or not this is an immoral 
party based on the acceptance of for- 
eign donations. 

We do still believe in the 
DemooaQc cause and will support 
fuure candidates but never Clinton

Racism permeates society's crevices 



To THE EDfTOR; 

Racism is unacceptable, Il is our 
goal to uulize die knowledge base. 
We do not seek from our professors 
on campus to enhance our knowl- 
edge base We do noi seek from our 
professors correction or improve- 
ment in our behavior or altitudes, to 
assunilate or to become in their eyes 
exceptional Negroes or a credit to a 
darker race. 

To those professors loathing our 
steely disposition into silent indiffer- 
ence, a yellow Hashing warning sign 
should be attached to their forehead 
with the words, "Warning. Racist 
fast approaching," 

Raasm is a belief thai differ- 
ences among people are rooted in 
ethnic stock. These differences 
include color, religion, bloodhne or 
national origin. Racism usually 
involves the assumption that one's 
own race is superior and that social 
and political organization should 
reflect that superionty Nazis persc- 



tuiiun of Jews pnor to World War II 
on the dieory that German Aryans 
consututed a superior race is a lead- 
ing example of racism, according to 
the American Political Dictionary 

We enpect to be able to enpress 
ourselves on the campus and feel as 
if we are a pan of die university 
community, as well as inclusion in 
activities on campus. 

Wc accept our differences and 
realize commonalities with others. 
In the words of Audre Lonje. 

"We have all been programmed 
to respond to the human differences 
between us widi fear and loadiing 
and to handle the difference in one 
of three ways: ignore it, and if that Ls 
not possible, copy it, if wc ihink it is 
dominant or destroy it. ." 

We acknowledge that university 
pohcy and procedure are in place lo 
assure our journey. In our aitempLs 
to reach our goal by working for a 
degree, we will be without interfer- 
ence However, havuig occasionally 
stepped on live booby traps and land 



muies a plenty, a smooth non-iacisl 
ride is no guaraniee. We have no 
faith in fake programs of diversity. 
And we do not a.sk for the universi- 
ty's permission to be treated widi 
dignity. 

Nor are we interested in die uni- 
versity's cleansing rituals in justify- 
ing its institutional racism as being 
just business as usual as it collects 
our tuition 

It is not our goal as students to 
teach professors the why as some 
students arrive at the front door with 
untied combat boots on ready lo kick 
down the locked doors of exclusion 
in the classroom. 

Nor as to why some students 
refuse to patiently stand in line wail- 
ing for approval from biased educa- 
tors. 

Both Nikki Giovanni who wrote 
"Racism 101." and Or, Martin 
Luther King Jr's "Why We Cant 
Wail" address these issues in books. 
Racism was stated belter than any of 
Rodney King's wannabe or 



Doubting Thomasians' chantmg the 
campus manu^s. "Can't we all just 
get along" or "You must pull your- 
self up by your boot straps in 
becoming a part of the privileged, 
'"Stamped Approval Genuine N.,. 
Club,'" 

We enter the university tearing 
down walls of intolerance to our 
presence and we hold the university 
accountable in their support of racist 
behavior from certain faculty mem- 
bers. I 

We challenge with action by 
protesting. We challenge with litiga-; 
tion. by suing the university And if 
diis makes the university uncomfort- 
able, perhaps it will begin to under- 
stand that it's the students' experi* 
ences, rather than what the universi- 
ty says about racism on the campus.

Integrity is lost in politicians 



Educated Blond: Dawn Sndm 




Have 
you noticed 
that when you 
tell someone 
what your 
nij]or is. it is 
.jlways fol- 
lowed by a 
comment from 
peanut 
gallery. 
Whedier you say a nurse, "Oh, how 
canng," an engineer, "Wow. you're 
smart," or a scientist, "Man you're 
taking all that math." 

Yes it's to be expected. 
Automatically a dozen stereotypes 
arise in everyone's mind. Especially 
when It's someihing that you think 
pays way too little, or you diink the 
person is way too stupid to do it. 

I seem to get a response from 
my major, although different from 
these responses About 75 percent of 
the people I talk 10 say the same 
thing. 

That's all wc need is anodier 
politician. 

So, I used to smile half-ass aiKl 
agree widi them, untd 1 heard one of 
my professors say thai the calLng to 
this profession was honorable 

And I agree 1 really believe my 
decision to be involved in politics is 
aspinng Why not? The job brings 
many perks along with it. Traveling 
the United States, making damn- 



good money, schmoozing and 
socializing widi big wigs, executive 
elites, past and present pohticians. 
and helping out the country along 
the way. 

Sure, some of you are silting 
there thinking that 1 sound like some 
money-hungry woman who just 
wants to live off the tax-payers 
money. Well I say, Yeah, like you all 
wouldn't like to. 

But seriously. 1 get tired of hear- 
ing Ihe comments about politicians 
The public places die.se people up on 
a pedestal with God, Expectations of 
a perfect past, abihty to gel every- 
thing solved, no taxes, with perfect 
highways. 

What people fail to forget ls the 
fact that they themselves are the 
ones who elected the people m 
office. And if you don't vole then 
you haven't even earned the right to 
complain. Thesc^people just don't 
fly into ofTice on the wings of the 
political fairy 

Second of all. diese men and 
women are a small mixture of our 
society. They represent all of us, 
from all fifty states. How can we 
expect those in government to be 
perfect when our society is further 
from perfect than it has ever been. 

It is funny to have the public 
ostracizing ofTicials when in reality 
their conscience knows they are no 
better than those they judge. The 



fact dial the people who serve us 
have to make their records and lives 
public, for mistakes to be seen, 
while the rest of you hide your dirty 
litde secrets, only makes politician's 
calhng more honorable. 

1 will admit dial what some peo- 
ple (Bill Clinton) have done while in 
office docs make me somewhat teed. 
But I presume that some of my ani- 
mosity IS because of his affiliation 
with the Democratic party, the natur- 
al rival of a Republican 

In all honesty, though, when you 
study the theory, history, and 
responsibilities of the United States 
government, it seems so astronomi- 
cal Unul you sludy it all you do not 
reahze everything it pariakes. 

What I'm saying is dunk for a 
minute just what the definition of 
politics means: the resolution of 
conflicts or disagreements over col- 
lective matters. 

Can you imagine trying to 
please millions of people and solv- 
ing dieir problems all at the same 



1 can, and danm I'm excited. I 
fmd it admuable I can't wait for die 
day to debate legislature, walk 
through Washington D C. as an 
employee, not on the scenic tour. 
and uphold the government as our 
forefathers set out to do.

Writer makes connection to contemporary religion 



Eyes facing forward: Jeremy Ecenoarger 




Ih 



siaie, IS a col- 
lege sludenl 
with an open 
mind. Here is 
one who longs 
lo be educated, 
fuiniled and 
enriched with 
names, lenni- 
nology and 
lechnic|ues in 
order lo aitain a fifmer grasp of his 
fuluce. And funhcrmore, here is a 
siudeni who takes what he studies, 
reads, memorizes and applies ii to 
his everyday life. 

Yeah, don'l we all wish this 
could be true? 

YeU with all wonder and dis- 
may, as I sat in a class a few weeks 
ago reading the works of amazing 
writers like Alexander Pope. Samuel 
Jackson and William Blake, I was 
filled with vast ideas Ibai had never 
before entered my poor, confused 
mind. Yet. it was the writing of John 
Dryden that took my mind half a 
turn to the right and then left about 
180 degrees, Don'i ask me where 1 
ended up facing. 

Anyway. Dryden's poem "A 
Layman's Faith" presented the idea 



of how the Bible has btcn iranslaied 
so many times from language lo lan- 
guage and from style to style thai 
how do we know that we're learning 
die right diings from a book Uiai has 
been around for centuries. Even 
more thought provoking... what did 
diey do before ihe Bible was creat- 
ed? 

Now, for someone who spent 
nine years in a Lutheran Parochial 
schoolandwhoispanofafamdy of 
avid church goers, you can imagine 
the questions thai were going 
dirough my bead. I'll just name a 
few: Was this man, Jesus, whom 1 
had spent my whole life beheving in 
and studying, this bogus idea a few 
guys (translators) created? Were ibe 
translators even fluent in Greek and 
Aramaic languages? What in the 
heck does the New International 
Version have in it that Ihe others 
don't? 

I mean it's a really scary idea! 
Seven days really seems like a short 
lime for God lo have created earth. 
Maybe it was onginally 365 days 
but some translator dioughi that was 
Jusi too much for such a supposed 
powerful being and just decided lo 
make il sound more astonishing, as 
if the translators embelhshed the 



original text, maybe just a little. For 
some reason, we all decided to 
believe m die Bible and ciraied our 
seven-day week. 

Even more lerrifymg, what if 
Eve was brought forth before 
Adam'.' Women do say Uiey maiure 
before men. And God knows tJicy 



try 10 rule our (men) lives anyway. 
In fact, it's possible the snake was- 
n't a snake ai all. According to the 
translators, it could have been a 5- 
pound Chihuahua for all we know. 

All right, so maytie diese ideas 
of mine arc a liide exireme, but reli- 
gions jusl seem lo be so touchy. 



Believers must learn to trust 
themselves more than anything; 
they must follow their instincts. 
Religion needs to be focused upon 

AN individual BECAUSE REALLY THAT'S 

what makes the strongest catholic 
Methodist Lutheran, or whatever. 



Methodists are differeni from 
Lutherans for mmor reasons such as 
the lime dicy allow children to lake 
Communion And sins of all sins. 
some drink wine instead of juice. 
What if Catholics put a htile more 
emphasis on Mother Mary dian 
Meihodisis and Lutherans? The list 
goes on and on. The question on all 
our minds is "What do we follow 
and by what means?" 

We know names like Moses. 
Peter and John, Yet a sunple slip of 
the pen could have changed Noelle 
to Noah, So what are we to do? Do 
we continue to spend our days read- 
ing verses from a Bible that we can't 
trust? Will we be damned if we 
don'l? 

It sounds confusmg, irriiating. 
too bizarre? Well, unfortunately it 
could be this crazy So, I gueiis it 
comes to that point where maybe I 
should discuss Dryden's solutions. 
Or should I let you eneafie your 
mind.s in ihese strange ideas.' No. 
dial would really piss ya off, would- 
n't il^ 

Faith holds the keys in this sce- 
nario. Like almost any story in the 
Bible, we have to have true faith 
Those who follow these organized 
religions must spend so much lime 



trying lo fill m die gaps. 

Believers must learn lo trust 
themselves more than anything; 
they must follow Lheir instincts. 
Religion needs to be focused upon 
an individual because really that's 
what makes the strongest Catholic 
Methodist Lutheran, or whatever. 
So even Uiough your parents may be 
strictly one religion, that doesn't 
necessarily mean it has to be yours. 
Create you own religion, one that 
stands upon your beliefs, ideas and 
morals. 

I'm not saymg go oui and create 
your own God, Bible or lessons. We 
may Lke to fast during Lent but hale 
the idea of shouting "Hail Mary" 
after the sermon. Followers must 
determine what and how they fol- 
low a faith. 

So. what did they do before the 
Bible was around? My guess is they 
look what they knew and worked 
from it""^ Thpv mfiPi\ whai ihev 
had and created a faiUi probably 
much stronger than most of us will 
ever know Their God came from 
die only things they knew: their 
mind, soul and heari. 




Animals must be treated fairly 



Letter To The Editor: 



'The greatness of a nation and 
its,mqrai prpgress can fcte judged by 
,', Oit- way, ,i(*,, an imals.,arei. treated." 
Maliaima Gandhi. 

On Gel. 2, animal activists 
_ around die world will observe World 
Farm Animals Day. an event held to 
expose and memorialize the 
tragedies faced by farm animals. 
The date, honors the birthday of one 
of the most influential, successful 
and nonviolent liberation activists of 
Ok 20di century, hfe long vegetari- 
an, Mahatma Gandhi, 

The idyllic myth of "Old 
McDonald's Farm," widi romanti- 
cized images of pigs wallowing in 
the mud. cows freely grazing in ihe 
Tields and chickens scampering 
around the barnyard, simply isn't a 
reality for billions of creatures ihat 
end up as meals for humans every 
year. Many modem farms have 
adopted an assembly line style of 
handling animals for slaughter. 
Some people have dubbed these 
wonders of modem industry, ""facto- 
ry farms." where the main objective 
is to maximize profits and minimize 
costs. Much like equipment in a fac- 
tory, the animals are treated more 
like money-making machines and 
less like living, fcchng creatures, 

All animab used for meat con- 



sumption must die; this is an obvi- 
ous fact. In addition, many animals 
used for food suffer from birth to 
death in extremely over-crowded 
conditions and unnatural surround- 
ings'' „',„ .,, 

This environment is a irivial 
appeasement of human palates. 
We're desensitized to diis unneces- 
sary suffering and think noi of the 
dead animal but of the tasty lump 
of mailer al the local supermarket. 
While most of us wouldn't even 
consider eating our fellow pets, 
why is il a commonly accepted 
axiom of our society thai odier 
creatures' lives are less valid and 
Uiat they may be used in any way 
we see fil? 

George Bernard Shaw said that 
"...custom will reconcile people lo 
any atrocity," It's hard lo challenge 
ideas thai a majority is comfortable 
with. At one time, our society 
allowed itself to enslave millions of 
people and these acu of genocide 
against the indigenous people of 
this country were justified. 

Society allowed women to be 
viewed as second class citizens or 
property of their husbands. 
Individuals who struggled for 
social change were, at first, viewed 
as radicals, fools, or ridiculous peo- 
ple trying to stir up trouble, 

1 would hope diat our compas- 
sion could progress as our world 



coniinues to grow and that oppres- 
sion and exploitation of all human 
beings and animals will cease to be 
ways of life.

was the place lo find some of ihc 
original music thai (his lown haJ to 
offer last Saiufday nighl Many line- 
up changes conlinuc lo plague the 
Migraines, On Sept. 20. SPHERIC 
along with local kings of pop-punk. 
the MIGRAINES, performed, 

I bad laken in a brief segment of 
a Sphere performance ai the 
National Guard Armory on Cook 
Road, and was looking forward lo 
seeing tbeir entire set 

Sphere is a band thai knows how 
10 draw on Iheir influences, bui aa* 
creative enough lo develop a sound 
thai is uniquely their own. What that 
, is exactly is hard to define As 
: bassist Jim Marks says, "It's a bunch 
: of music together, metal . altema- 
; live," 

If one is a fan of heavier music 
■ than usually found on the radio, they 
; should give Sphere serious consid- 
: OBlion. I'm not saying that they arc 
; a throw-back lo a long-gone musical 
era, TTiere is definitely a nineties 



feel lo their music. 

The young band (no one is older 
than 22) has been playing together 
for about three and a half years 
However, drummer Eric and bassist 
Jim have hooked up musically for 
about eight years — since dieir early 
high school days. The rest of the 
band includes Dave (rhythm guitart 
and Rick (lead vocals and guitar). 

Everyone in the band is from 
Fon Wayne except Rick, who is 
from Angola. 

The band cites their influences 
as being: Nirvana, Rush, Metalhca, 
and Slayer, There are few local 
bands that move me to do anything 
besides politely sii and listen. But. 
Sphere rocked They have a big, 
tight sound that is very impressive 

Background vocals (done by 
Jim) actually add depth to a song, 
instead of bemg just another frag- 
ment of the cacophony. When hsten- 
ing to them play, my mind devel- 
oped an image of a locomotive that 
could go fast enough to get your 
aiiention. but was not so out of con- 
trol that it would kill you. 

Who would have thought that 



80's guitar and 90's confusion 
(pounding drums and intense, intel- 
ligent lyrics) could work so well? 

SO what aboui the name 
Sphere? Tt has nothing lo do with 
circles. In fact, according to Eric, "It 
probably had something to do with 
death." 

TTic band Ls in the process of 
recording an as-yet nameless CD. It 
will eventually contain thirteen 
songs, seven of which are complet- 
ed. The release date is uncertain 

"We're laiy. it takes awhile," 
Jim says 

I hope that they have enough 
energy to get the songs 
"Greenglass." and '"Schizo Boy." 
my favontes, on the disc 

l,ocal onginal bands play in a 
variety of venues You have to look 
for their names No one can com- 
plain about lack of local lalent in

support It.

As a financially-strapped col-

options in Fort Wayne to choose 
from for financial guidance One 
such local institution, ITiree Rivers 
Federal Credit Union, has made a 
community-enhancing effort to 
make your money go further 

In 1996, Three Rivers Federal 
Credit Union became the first credit 
union in Indiana to become a partic- 
ipant in the Community 
E&gt;e\-elopment Credit Union expan- 
sion Charier (CDCU). This program 
was designed to offer its low-cost 
services to a portion of Fon Wayne 
that was formerly ineligible for 
credit union membership 

If you ate not familiar with the 
concept of a credit union, credit 
union membership is restricted lo 
specific employer-employee rela- 
uonships and/or family relation- 
ships. Three Rivers' CDCU allows 
the credit union to expand its mem-

According to Clark Woods, of 
Three Rivers' Business 
Development Division. "With ihe 
philasophy of helping people help 
themselves. Three Rivers felt that 
the mission of this project fell with- 
in their existing guidelines., lo 
bring credit union products and ser- 
vices to those who have litde or no 
access to affordable financial ser-

designed to complement the credit 
union industry's efforts to charter 
new and existing credit unions " 

Three Rivers also has a related 
program. Ihe Community 
Development Mortgage Program. 
Through this program. Three Rivers 
has made S2 million dollars avail- 
able 10 the CDCU area of Eon 
Wayne for the purpose of providing 
new homeowners with 100 percent 
financing, mearung no down pay-

To be qualified for the 
Mortgage Program, applicants can- 
not currently be homeowners and 
the home that they wish to purchase 
must be within Ihe CDCU bound- 
aries. The maximum home purchase 
price cannot exceed S75,CKX) and the 
home must be used as a primary res-

have a steady income and a good

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. I am a diabetic who 
sometimes must have 
insulin injections while on 
campus- What's the best 
way to dispose of my 
syringes? 

A. Ideally, vou should recap 
them and take them home for 
disposal. If that's not possible, 
recap the synnges and 
enclose ihem in a leakproof, 
puncture-resistant container 
BEFORE putting them 



trash. 



To ensure the safety of

never throw a

Sophomore LHP/OF Matt Erdeldine throws Ihe high heal al 
practice 

By Tony Laux 

Sports Eextor 



l^ng over a 9-41 team is a 
challenge for any coach but Tony 
Vitiorio. head baseball coach, and 
with this challenge he has excelled. 
He demands things are done right 
aJI the time not every other time. 
While silling in practice Vittorio 
had the team practicing bunt plays 
where a player did not make a div- 
ing attempt and Vittorio questioned 
his heart because as he said it, "We 
lay out for everything here at IPFW 
because we have hean when we 
play and, I mean every play," 

Viiiorio's goals for the team are 
simple and the same every year. 
Win a Great Lakes Valley 
Conference championship and go to 
Montgomery. Ala., to win the 
Division II National Championship. 

With 16 returning players and 
going 24-23 m his Tirst year he feels 
that Ihe foundation has been laid 
and wiih the help of his assistants he 
feels dial they can have the "bouse 
up" by the start of the spring season. 

Todd Linkiaier, Vittorio says, is 
"a person that has a great under- 
standing of the outfield and 
offense." He will coach first base 

Guy Keller, will serve as pitch- 
ing coach due to his outstanding 
knowledge of the pitching game. 
Vittorio said. 

Wttorio said that coach Danny 
Debs "is my proverbial nghi-hand- 
man and will work with the catch- 
ers." 

When asked aboul a team cap- 
tain Vittorio explained that "he 
expects all 32 people to be captains 
and lead die team to the goals Uiat 
have been seL" He does point out 
some individuals that have helped 
get the program pointed in the nght 
direction, 

Ryan Wallace "has bt«n one of 
his most consistent players diat he 
has ever coached." Matt Dressier, 
"comes to practice and leads by 
example." E)anny Mathews is "the 
clubhouse clown that keeps the 
team's spuits up," and Jason Glenr 
is "a more vocal leader that we 
expect bigger things from." 

The fall season started widi a 
bang with a two-game sweep at 
Indiana Institute of Technology 
(IIT) beating them 9-7 and 12-3. 
The offense has definitely shown 
diat it can do the job by bitting 
seven homers during the two 
games, 

Rico Martin had dirce dmgcts. 
Casey Fogel had two and Jason 
Jaffe and Billy Segerman each had 
one. 

Vittono said the game was an 
"exciting &lt;(an to the new year and

he plans to get 
better every- 
day." He fell 
that the defense 
was good 
enough to win 
Ihe game but 
felt that it needs 
to get better to 
win a champi- 
onship 

This sea- 
son does pre- 
sent a unique 
challenge this 
__,^^^^^^ year because 
the University of Kentucky is on the 
schedule. 

"Playing a Division I school is a 
win-wui situation because they are 
such a good school, playing in the 
best Division I conference m the 
nation (SEC). Uiat the only diiicr- 
ence will be the hoopla and hysii-n.i 
because we will play to win and do 
everydiing lo win," Vitiorio said. 

The fall season continues this 
Saturday with a game against 
Huntington College at I pm at 
IPFW where die team will continue 
its march to Monigomery.
