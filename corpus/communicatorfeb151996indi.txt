IPFW appoints Vice Chancellor 



by S. Branl Kelley 
News Editor 

IPFW has appointed a new vice- 
chancellor of academic affairs 
Professor and Dean of the School 
of Education Fenwick W English 
will succeed Interim Vice 
Chancellor Douglas W. Townsend, 
effective April 1. 

English, formerly of ihe 
University of Kentucky, became a 
professor and dean of the School of 
Education at IPFW in July 1, 1995. 
He left UK as ihe chair of ihe edu- 
cation department 

When he came lo IPFW, English 
said he did not intend to occupy an 
admin istraiive position "1 had no 
idea that would transpire," he said 

"They had been searching for a 
candidate for a long time and no 
internal candidate had applied," 
English said. "I think there should 
be an internal candidate." 

In his new duties, English said 
he wants lo investigate IPFW's 
dropout rate, which is currently 37 
percent, ambiguity in the professor- 




ial lenure promotion process, facul- 
ty evaluation of department chairs 
and differences in lengths of service 
of department chairs and their pay 

Many other 
faculty mem- 
bers also 
believe the new 
vice chancellor 
should come 
from within the 
university, 
according to 
English. 

Townsend 
will resume 
leaching in the 
department of mathematical sci- 
ences, where he was head of the 
department before becoming inter- 
im vice chancellor of academic 
affairs. 

"I'd done il for seven years," 
Townsend said. "My desire is to get 
back with ihe faculty" 

Townsend said he felt fortunate 
to be able to fill in the position bul 
is glad to return to leaching with the 
faculty.

"It's been a wonderful experi- 
ence," Townsend said. "I wasn't a 
candidate for the vice chancellor of 
academic affairs ... I was happy to 
fill in this 
office ... My 
desire has been 
to get back to 
the faculty."

NEW kicks off Feb. 22-24 



by David Howard 
Staff Writer 

Sludents will have a chance to 
speak to representatives from sever- 
al prestigious engineering and tech- 
nology companies about a career in 
a technology field during National 
Engineers Week (NEW), Feb 22- 
24 According to Bob Barrett, pro- 
fessor of computer science, ten to 
twelve companies dealing mostly 
with engineering and technology 
fields will be at IPFW during Ihe 
week. 

"Any student interested in talk- 
ing with a company representative 
about jobs, careers and the future of 
these companies, this would be an 
ideal opportunity to do so." Barrett 
said. 

Engineering alumni will be on 
hand from 11 am to 2 p.m. on 
Saturday. Feb. 24, in the Walb 
Union. Tours of the new 
Engineering and Technology build- 
ing will be provided for those who 
are interested. 




The event is being held mostly 
for it's educational value, according 
to Wayne Unsell, professor of civil 
and architectural technology 
Unsell said 
people should 
be informed as 
to what engi- 
neers do. He 
also said that 
they are trying 

t _ VV I t0 involve stu- 
\\ dents. 
- L - iJ This is 

Barrett the biggest 

joint eveni of 
all engineering societies in Fort 
Wayne," Harold Broherg, professor 
of electrical engineering technolo- 
gy, said. 

Exhibits of student projects will 
be displayed According to Unsell. 
the projects should prove that engi- 
neering isn't all laborious mathe- 
matics, but that il can be a fun and 
exciting discipline An annual 
bridge building contest for high 
school students and an electric 



motor design contest for middle 
school sludents will be held. There 
will be other displays throughout 
the week in which anyone can par- 
ticipate. 

There will be an awards presen- 
tation for the top engineering and 
engineering technology students at 
the close of National Engineers 
Week. Fifteen to 20 scholarships 
will be awarded to students at the 
ceremony In addition to the schol- 
arship awards, an award will be 
given to the engineer who has con- 
tributed most to the community 
during the past year. The awards 
presentation and banquet will bring 
to a close the events of this year's 
NEW celebration. 

In the pasi, NEW has held its 
celebration day at various locations, 
including Glenbrook and 
Southlown malls, but with little 
turnout. By holding the events on 
campus, the organization hopes to 
have more success this year 

Local media will provide cover- 
age all three days.

Developmental classes serve purpose 



A scary report from ihe 
American Council on Education 
stales ibat some universities are 
considering cutting some, if not all, 
of what is being called "remedial 
courses." We would like to call 
them "developmental courses" 
because we find "remedial" (a term 
"Webster's New World 
Dictionary" defines as "correc- 
tive") lo be insulting lo those who 
take them. 

Some universities are trying to 
tnm their budgets and view drop- 



ping key developmental courses as 
a lucrative option Those who 
would be hurt the most are minori- 
ties and returning adulis 1PFW has 
not been rumored to be one of ihese 
schools, but with declining enroll- 
ment, nobody knows what drastic 
measures will be taken. 

Some think high schools should 
pay for the classes students need to 
prepare for college But the typical 
high school curriculum does nol 
prepare students for the demands of 
college, or else every student 



would be in advanced placement 
courses An added push, such as 
developmental courses, could mean 
success for a student who did nol 
fair well in secondary school. 

For the returning adult, remem- 
bering math for as many as two 
decades (or more) is a near impos- 
sible task. Developmental classes 
retrain the brain lo think scbolasti- 
cally. If they are dropped from the 
curriculum, many older would-be 
students may decide to sue on ihe 
basis of age di scrim ma lion. If one 



can only survive a class because 
she is a younger student, then a 
case for age discrimination could 
be made 

It is a university's responsibility.

sands of dollars on tuition, lo fur-

Letters to the editor 



Gay community finally trying to work together 



To the editon 

I'd like to address an issue with- 
in the gay/le s bian/bi sexual commu- 
nity thai has been on my mind of 
laie The largest problem has been a 
lack of cones iven ess. 

I feel this is due lo a lack of 
leaders and strong organizations. If 
one were to look at ihe strongest of 
the minority groups, African 
Americans, one would see that ihe 
mosl successful leaders have been 



religious leaders. Rev Martin 
Luther King, Jr.'s 1963 March on 
Washington. Rev Jesse Jackson's 
political triumphs, and Rev. Louis 
Farakkan's recent Million Man 
March have all accomplished great 
things for their community Behind 
these men lies a very powerful 
force. Churches all over the country 
organized their small congregations 
in support when they were called 
upon Together they created a rally- 
ing cry that could not be silenced 



Landing questioned 



To ihe edilor; 



Regarding Paul Tupper's col- 
umn ("The Future is in the Stars," 
Feb. 1, 1996) that mentioned a 
moon landing in 1969 If you were 
referring to ihe Apollo Eleven mis- Greg Stoddard 
sion I would like lo poini out that 
there is pracucally no evidence to 



prove that anyone set foot on the 
moon, but there is a large body of 
evidence to prove that the mission 
as presenied lo ihe American pub- 
lic was technically impossible. 



Walb space excuse questionable 



To the editor; 



I \ 



mid like to make a com- 
ment lo last weeks slory ("Walb's 
lack of space creates several prob- 
lems") dealing with the lack of 
space in Walb Student Union A 
quote in reference to Walb staled 
that. "The students would like a 
union building that has space for 
activities, lots of food service and 
siudcm-oriented enicrtainmeni 
The problem is, the building was 
built with thai in mind Shortage of 
space on the campus has forced 
scheduling of more than was origi- 
nally planned." 

Being a full-time student on 
this campus. I find it difficult to 
believe thai there is a shortage of 
classroom space available I say 
this based on Iwo primary reasons: 
1) In walking through campus ai 
any given time of day, I lend to 



notice vacant or unused class- 
rooms in many of the other build- 
ings. This observation is in defi- 
nite contrast to ihe statement that 
there is a lack of space available 
2) According to a story in the 
Communicator ("IPFW enrollment 
drops again," Feb. 1. 1996). 
spring enrollment declined four 
percent from last year and contin- 
ued a Irend of small declines from 
previous years. If enrollment is 
dropping which seems lo be the 
case, thai means fewer students, 
fewer classrooms being used. 

This leaves me wondering., is 
there really a lack of space avail- 
able or is the problem really one of 
a logistical mailer? Walk through 
the campus and decide this for 
yourself. 

George Gounaris 



and showed ihe world their 
strength. 

Clearly, we lack religious lead- 
ers to build our community We 
each must then become involved in 
groups thai can bring us together 
and build support for change. Only 
in this way can we become power- 
ful These small groups contribute 
lo society as well as the gay com- 
munity, but as they grow and 
become stronger, ihey will provide 
both a base and a leadership. When 



the time comes these leaders will be 
able to effectively utilize our 
power. 

Following the incredible support 
and enthusiasm of ihe recent visit 
by Donna Red Wing, the groups 
and people of this area are uniting 
to work towards a greater cobesive- 
ness. A committee has been formed 
to put together a community-build- 
ing conference, to be held in late 
spring or early summer. In bringing 
the community together and giving 



a louder voice to all concerns and 
needs, the hope is to solidify ihe 
gay/lesbian/bisexual community 
and form an organization thai will 
be representative of and responsive 
to the needs and desires of the 
group as a whole The Alternative 
Lifestyles Student Organization 
(ALSO), an IPFW group, is trying 
to be a pan of this We are also try- 
ing to build an alliance with other 
groups in the area 1 urge all of you 
to become active or supportive in 



some way 

Supportive heterosexuals are 
welcome lo help this effort. A sin- 
gle person may be able to build a 
house, but together we can build a 
community .

Native beliefs should be studied, respected 



To the editor; 

Several articles in recent issues of The 
Communicator have touched upon rebunal and 
the Native American Graves and Repatriation 
Act (NAGPRA) It is important lhat people 
interested in these topics be aware of current 
issues. As an archaeologist who has experience 
in excavating and examining human remains. I 
am intimately aware of the requirements of 
NAGPRA and the sentiments of Native 
Americans on the reburial issue. 

First, the NAGPRA does NOT require insti- 
tutions to return the remains of the deceased 
Native Americans to ihcir original tribe II 
DOES require institutions ihaijeceive federal 
funds lo send an inventory of human remains 
and associated funerary artifacts to tribes thai 
have an historical connection to the geographic 
region from which the remains were recovered 
For instance, burials found in northeast Indiana 
would be reported lo the Miami, regardless of 
whether or not we know that the remains arc 
ancestors of any living Miami*. Historic tribes 
may decide whai happens lo items and human 
remains of known cultural or biological rela- 
tionship lo them. They may or may nol decide 
on reburial or on a return to the tribe. 

When we examine NAGPRA and reburial, ii 
is important to understand that reburial is funda- 
mentally a political issue, nol a religious issue 
Ii is often reported that Native American tradi- 
tions call for burial of ancestors and thai if a 
body is disturbed, the soul has no rest. While 
this may be traditional in some groups, il is far 
from universal among Native Americans. In tra- 
ditional Miami, Cbippewa, Menomini, and 
many other Native American cultures, ihe dead 



person's burial siie is attended closely for three 
(or sometimes four) days, and food is left for ihe 
soul's journey. Afler three (or four) days, the 
soul's journey is over What happens after lhat 
lo the body is irrelevant lo the soul. Among ihe 
Choctaw and Cherokee, bodies were left on 
scaffolds to rot, ihen the bones were picked over 
by a special priest called a flesh-picker Afler 
Ihe picked-over bones were stored in a chamd 
house, they were eventually buried, bul seldom 
were all of any one person's bones collecied 
completely and placed in the ground. 

The point is thai there was. and still is. great 
diversity among Native Americans in their 
views on ihe afterlife The idea thai because 
some Native Americans accept one belief, all 
Native Americans share that belief is very racist 
and denies to many Native Americans their own 
voice. Since we generally agree dial diversity 
and muluvocality are of great importance, ii is 
interesting that the media allow one group lo 
hegemonically impose a singular point of view 
on all (or even mosl) Native Americans 

A final myth that conunucs lo be spread is 
that archaeologists don't excavate while graves 
bul are free to dig up Native American graves 
wilh impunity This sentiment does have histori- 
cal justification, no doubt, and I am in sympathy 
with much of ihe agenda of people who demand 
rcspeci for humans, both living and dead. 
Fortunately, in Indiana all human remains are 
now treated equally under the 1989 revision of 
our burial law (which was passed largely 
through the efforts of archaeologists with the 
aid of several Native American groups). 

In this slate, any human remains encountered 
by anyone at any time must be reported to ihe 
Division of Historic Preservation and 



Archaeology within 2 days of discovery. The 
stale will make an inquiry and a determination 
of what ultimately happens lo those remains, 
whelber il be immediate reburial. study and 
rebunaL or study with no set date for rebunal 
Their criteria for making such a decision is 
based upon. I) known biological descendants 
and their desires; 2) known cultural descen- 
dants; and 3) scientific and educational value of 
the materials. These criteria are applied by the 
siaie agency lo all newly discovered human 
remains. Many other stales have ihe same or 
similar provisions. 

I believe it is crucial lhat we all lake an inter- 
est in Ihe ways that we use the cultural patrimo- 
ny of others in our investigations into the world 
around us Sensitivity to other peoples' religious 
and cultural beliefs is an important component 
when we choose what we study This sensitivi- 
ty, however, should nol be the sole criterion for 
making our decisions on whai and bow we 
study the world The excavation and examina- 
tion of human remains has an important place in 
the scientific study of humans. Just as religion 
was invoked lo prevent the use of human cadav- 
ers in European medical research during 
Medieval times, religion is again being invoked 
for political reasons to prevent the use of skele- 
tons in -inn I. ii research It is my belief that ihere 
is plenty of evidence thai indicates the societal 
good lhat comes from such research outweighs 
ihe racially motivated concerns of one sub- 
group.

Retire 
Souder 
in '96 



To the editor. 

Democratic congressional chal- 
lenger Jcny Houseman's position 
on PACs hils the nail on the mark 

There are concrele differences 
heiween labor union and public 
inierest political action committees. 
and the transnational corporate 
PACs that finance incumbent 
Soulier's campaign One example 
Mr Houseman has cited that illus- 
trates the difference is organized 
labor's support for a higher mini- 
mum wage, regardless of tbe fact 
that such legislation does not 
directly benefit the unions. Such a 
raise in wages would, however, 
benefit millions of non-union work- 
ing people, many of whom com- 
prise tbe working poor, and it 
would also have positive economic 
effects across tbe board by reduc- 
ing tbe numbers of people who 
require food stamps or other forms 
of public assistance to supplement 
inadequate wages and benefits 

The purchasing power of the 
national minimum wage has 
declined by 26 percent during the 
last 20 years. Recent efforts to raise 
the minimum wage from S4.25 to 
an extremely modest 55 per hour. 
an incremental increase over the 
next 3 years, have been vehemently 
opposed by Souder and his corpo- 
rate patrons. The chief beneficiaries 
of this wage rip-off are corporate 
executives who don't fairly com- 
pensate their employees. Minimum 
wage workers are now consigned 
by Souder and his special interests 
clients to further declines in already 
threadbare living standards, as 
inflation over the next three years 
cats away at dial frozen wage 

Jerry Houseman's perceptions 
on campaign finances and their leg- 
islative causes and effects are right 
on target. His commitment to eco- 
nomic justice for people in the 4th 
District, who work hard and 
deserve fair compensation for hard 
work, is what we desperately need 
in Congress right now. When tax- 
payers are forced to pay support to 
people whose wages can't support 
their families, we're paying a form 
of corporate welfare, by making up 
for what the employer should have 
paid in fair wages and compensa- 
tion. 

Let's retire Souder in '96, get 
bis corporate welfare bums off the 
public dole, and get some justice 
for minimum wage workers and 
taxpayers in general.

Caring Eads deserves understanding, not slamming 



To the editor 

This letter was written in 
response to the editorial staff's 
bashing of our university student 
body president Kevin Eads. To say 
that Kevin is long on promises and 
short on action is simply not fair; 
anyone who knows anything about 
the political process understands 
that change does not occur 
overnight. After all, Rome was not 
built in one day Kevin has attempt- 
ed to fulfill the promises he has 
made, but progress docs not come 
as easy as one might think For 
example, efforts were made to 
bring a popular music band to the 



campus, but funds arc limited and 
with low enrollment over the past 
few semesters, the university 
administration is not exactly jump- 
ing at the chance to grant extra 
money for such activities. On the 
issue of the student's evaluations of 
professors being made available, 
this is not an easy task to accom- 
plish. There are legal issues to 
address, and also opposition from 
some university administration and 
certain instructors, who may have 
legitimate arguments The fact that 
the Geosciences Department's eval- 
uations are now available is a sign 
that they are making progress in 
this area. Don't be fooled, this issue 



Lack of leadership, understanding in ALSO 



To the editor 

As one of the original students 
involved with the formation of 
ALSO, I cannot express how disap- 
pointed 1 am over the current state 
of tbe organization This was my 
first experience with ALSO in some 
time and found the club to be 
severely lacking in purpose, direc- 
tion and leadership. Much of the 
meeting was spent attacking its for- 
mer president and pointing fingers 
at who is to blame for the current 
stale of the organization This par- 
ticular meeting was to elect new 
leadership and discuss the reorgani- 
zation of ALSO While this could 
have been a very productive meet- 
ing, the president-elect, Mr Jeff 
Sterling, spent more time explain- 
ing bis personal opinions and dis- 
likes about ALSO's former presi- 
dent than actually discussing what 
be planned on doing for the mem- 
bers of ALSO. He did made an 
attempt to discuss the new objec- 
tives of the club, but did so in such 
a way that he made it sound as if he 
were intentionally preventing other 
students from organizing other stu- 
dent organizations that may address 



gay and lesbian issues. At one point 
in the meeting a student who was 
attending for the first time even 
pointed this fact out to Mr Sterling 
who, of course, backed down from 
his position I was also amazed by 
Mr Sterling's lack of understand- 
ing about the necessary protocols 
used to conduct a student officer 
election. Had it not been for myself 
and an IPFW faculty member. Mr 
Sterling would have appointed him- 
self president without even putting 
it to a formal vote. 

ALSO was not formed to be this 
sort of caddish social student orga- 
nization. ALSO's original intent 
was to provide a positive supportive 
environment where friendships 
could be forged and the members 
could experience personal under- 
standing and growth. 
Unfortunately. I do not believe that 
the current president has the integri- 
ty nor the leadership abilities to 
serve the members of ALSO or be a 
representative of an TPF"W student 
organization.

human being who cares about the 
students on campus. 1 want to com- 
mend hun for speaking out. last 
month, against the hateful message 
of the Ku Klu* Klan. He did this 
not because he wanted to look 
good, but because he believes what 
be said and because it was the right 
thing to do 

If anyone is to blame for the sit- 
uation on our campus, it may be the 
students themselves This is not 
meant to be a criticism, but rather 
an encouragement. Most students, 
but not all. aren't willing to get 



involved in the political process of 
the university; I am guilty of this 
myself. Yet we are more willing to 
complain when affected negatively 
by it. What it comes down to is that 
not just one person is to blame for 
the problems on campus; the presi- 
dent, the university administration, 
the instructors and the students 
could all shoulder some of the 
blame. So until Kevin Eads shows 
us that he is not concerned with the 
students, or the issues that arc 
important to them, he is perfectly 
capable of being our president and 
deserves our support.

Black history month open to all 



To the editor; 

February is the time for the cele- 
bration of "Black History," but it is 
solely not for the black race to cele- 
brate. It is for one particular race 
The HUMAN RACE. There are 
many people who today need this 
knowledge of our involvement and 
accomplishments in history. This, I 
believe, is because for many years 
the primary history being taught 
was that of white European history. 

In our primary education, we 
learned of great inventors who 
brought us such things as the tele- 
phone and light bulb If you ask a 
child, a teenager, and/or adult today 
who invented these things, you 
would be answered Alexander 
Graham Bell and Thomas Edison. 
But these two men were not solely 
responsible for these accomplish- 
ments. History books and educators 
failed to mention the significant 
contributions a black man, who was 
an inventor, engineer, draftsman, 
and overall great human being, had 
on these inventions. This great 
achiever was Lewis Latimer. 
Surprised.' You've just learned the 



purpose of celebrating Black 
History Month: To acknowledge 
the many hidden and unknown 
African-American greats of our 
past. 

Once again, the Black Collegian 
Caucus (BCC). along with the 
Office of Multicultural Services, 
are joining collaborative efforts to 
give credit where credit is due. 

Multicultural Services, in honor 
of Black History Month, is sponsor- 
ing a film series. This scries por- 
trays different stories of African 
Americans and their experiences. 
The final three dates of the scries 
are Feb 15, 22, and 29, and the 
showings are in Walb Union 116 at 
noon. All are welcome. 

But the celebration does not end 
there Students Government has 
joined these two organizations to 
sponsor a musical performance and 
lecture by the talented and provoca- 
tive world-renowned flutist, Galen 
Abdur-Razzaq. A master's graduate 
of Rutgers University, New 
Brunswick, and former student of 
the Berkeley College of Music. 
Abdur-Razzaq has been perform- 
ing, arranging, composing, direct- 



ing and instructing for over twenty- 
five years We invite people of all 
races and ages to join the fun and 
honor this great African American, 
on Thursday, Feb. 22, a day filled 
with many activities. 

Here is a schedule of events: 

11 a.m -1 p.m. Ethnic food and 
goods sale, Walb Ballroom 

1:30 p.m.-2:30pm workshop 
and performance, Walb Ballroom 

7pm. -8:30p.m. second work- 
shop and performance, with a 
reception following. Neff Recital 
Hall 

The BCC invites all to join this 
celebration of a history worth learn- 
ing. 1, on the other hand, challenge 
you to come. As an African 
American. I wish all would learn 
and celebrate the month by support- 
ing the campus-based events as 
well as any community events you 
can access. I am asking for every- 
one to participate for just one 
month, or even one day. I celebrate 
Black History Month every day of 
my life.

PIT presents longest running musical 




by Amanda Mi 
Features Editor 

Purdue Indiana Theater is cur- 
rently cclehrating its thirtieth 
anniversary with the musical "The 
Fantaslicks." The musical runs Feb. 
14-17 at 8 p.m. in the Studio 
Theater. 

With over 10,000 off-Broadway 
performances since its opening on 
May 3, 1960, "The Fantaslicks" is 
the longest running musical in the 



world and still remains a favorite 
with theater enthusiasts. Director 
Craig A. Humphrey, assistani pro- 
fessor of theatre, said that the show 
has a universal appeal which 
explains its success. 

"I have loved 'Tbe Fantaslicks' 
for years. It speaks to all of us. It's 
beautifully simple and compteiely 
unrestricuve." said Humphrey. 

"The Fantaslicks" tells a story of 
the folly and fragility of young 
love, aging and human nature. As 



audience members walcb the rela- 
tionship between two young people 
develop on stage, they receive a 
poignant message delivered through 
the show's humor and music. 
Characters build and tear down 
emotional and physical walls 
throughout the show. 

The production abounds with a 
wealth of IPFW's dramatic talent. 
Michael Nelaborige portrays the 
character El Gallo. Heidi Warfel is 
cast as Luis a, Gavino Overa as 



Matt. Tommy D'Annuzio as 
Hucklebee. Scott Frey as Bellomy, 
Brad Beauchamp as Henry, Jack 
Cany as Mortimer, and Sara 
Lankenaue as the mute. Humphrey 
said he was pleased to announce 
that six of the eight roles are por- 
trayed by theater majors. 

Making his PIT directorial debut 
with this production. Humphrey, 
director of design and technology 
for the theater department, has valu- 
able experience on which to fall 



back He directed "A Funny Thing 
Happened Along the Way" at the 
Arena Dinner Theatre in Dec. 1994 
Previously he was assistani profes- 
sor at the Universily of Mississippi, 
where he laughi costume design 
and construction, history of dress 
and decor and make-up 

On Feb. 8, Humphrey watched 
his cast take to the stage on opening 
night. That weekend, PIT played to 
a sold-out house. 

"I'm very proud of ihem |the 



cast), They're all doing a wonderful 
job." said Humphrey 

Theater-goers can catch "The 
Fantaslicks" this week Admission

S3. 1PFW students; $S, non-IPFW

Student conducts 5W survey 



by Andrew Voder 
StafTWriler 

By now many of you have either 
read or heard about the current sur- 
vey being conducted by Craig Hill, 
assistant professor of psychology, 
concerning IPFW students' atti- 
tudes about sex and relation- 
ships. As a participant in 
this siudy, I find it frustrating 
that I am not the person who 
gets to read and laugh ai the 
responses given by the par- 
ticipants. So, to make myself 
feel better, 1 have conducted 
my own sex survey via per- 
sonal interviews with IPFW stu- 
dents. My survey, while being a lad 
more informal and less pretentious, 
nevertheless provided a humorous, 
if not representative, view of stu- 
dent altitudes about sex. 

The most interesting part of stu- 
dent responses to my questions 
were those that related to what they 
thought other students' attitudes 
were. IPFW students think that their 
colleagues are a preily sexual bunch 
of people, of whom at least ninety 
percent are currently sexually 
active. I thought of this as an exces- 
sive number, but a number of stu- 
dents echoed this belief. In fact, 
many students whom I interviewed 
described other things that are 
shocking in their own right. For 



instance, several students described 

sexual experiences they have had 

right here 

on campus, 

in and 

around 




cal act. Participants thought that 
females are more emotional and 
often confuse other, unrelated feel- 
ings with the physical act of sex. 
Others discussed how inexperience 
affects many adolescents, causing 
them to fall in love with their mates 
and then become heartbroken when 
their relationships fail 
■ »■ MimiiTiir Students

seen anyone 
having sex on cam 
pus. 

It was also interest- 
ing to listen to students talk about 
their reasons for having sex. They 
generally believe that women asso- 
ciate sex with love and/or emotion- 
al feelings, while the majority of 
men look at sex as merely a physi-

them," 

one 

respondent who 

chose to remain 

anonymous. 

Some went on to 
say (bat sex between 
individuals always 
produces a change in 
the relationship, for better or worse 
Some changes are more desirable 
than others - - an obvious concept to 
anyone who has witnessed the pub- 
lic sexual practices of students in 
the Union Building.

Offerings for a goddess 



hyNol Berkley 
Editor 

She has been called a "new-age 
wiich," a "diminutive redheaded 
feminist man-haier." CaJI ber what 
you will, but Myra Ellen Amos, 
you may know her as Tori, is no 
one's whipping girl anymore 

Tori's latest CD. "Boys for 
Pele," lashes out at many of the 
men in her life. Her recent breakup 
wilh longtime lover and producer 



Eric Rosse has been the catalyst in 
this somewhat rambling, but 
unwavering exploration of Tori's 
soul. 

Tori has exercised her demons 
and monsters in a most visceral 
method In "Hey Jupiter," Tori 
sings, "and I thought you'd see 
with me/you wouldn'i have to be 
something new." Tori confessed 
"Hey Jupiter'" was written mainly 
to heal herself after her breakup 
with Rosse. 




In case the title of the CD 
caused confusion. Tori is not a 
great soccer fan. Pele was a 
Hawaiian goddess whose appease- 
ment required the sacrifice of 
males. These men were thrown 
into a live volcano. 

Like the volcano, Tori bubbles 
over wilh undefined anger spew- 
ing like lava and asb over the 
countryside Tori emerges from 
this eruption shining and ready to 
conquer the world. 

The singer wrote and produced 
"Boys for Pele." and 1 must won- 
der if Rosse could have made a 
belter producer than Tori. She 
seems to need someone to rein her 
in so she is not so self-indulgent in 
her song writing. The friction 
between these two may have pro- 
duced another CD as good as her 
first, "Little Earthquakes." 

Standing alone, "Boys for Pele" 
delivers and is much better than 
"Under the Pink," but she falls 
short of her so-called debui. Her 
rabid fans will not care lhat 
"Boys" does not measure up to 
"Earthquakes." "Boys" debuted at 
number two and has been in the 
top 10 on the album charts for iwo 
weeks. For any obsessive fan. Tori 
will starl her U.S. lour in April 
Get your tickets fast because rabid 
fans (myself included) eat up those 
tickets like bugs in a prison camp.

Remember when, as a kid, you 
proudly brought home the artwork 
you made in school? Cuioul shapes 
of colored construction paper, fold- 
ed and glued in the right way, 
became three-dimensional animals. 
Blobs of primary color paint creat- 
ed magnificent butterflies when 
squished within a folded page We 
were masters with markers, creat- 
ing virtuosos of glitter and glue. 

Then somehow, later in grade 
school, we noticed thai only certain 
people were the artists. "You draw 
very well, Jeremy," we heard the crafis you used to enjoy and then 
teacher say to fhe kid sitting nezi lo try out some of those again. Go to 
us. Looking at our own crude inter- an art store and browse around until 
pretations of sunsets or horses or you find something that strikes 
people, we began lojudge our work your fancy. You might find some- 
with a critical eye. Besides, nobody ihing sane and sensible like cross- 
put our stuff on the refrigerator Milch patterns: but don't hold back 
anymore if what you really want is the cool 

As adults, most people find set of Shrinky Dinks Go ahead and 
themselves so busy with mature, get yourself that box of 64 with a 



practical things like 
doing taxes and pay- 
ing bills that they 
forget what it is like 
to have fun creating 
art for its own sake 
When we deny our 
creative urges, stifle 
imagination or forget 
our dreams, the light 
inside us dims. We 
wonder why things 
don't feel as vibrant 
anymore , 

Getting back into creativity for 
the sheer pleasure of it can enliven 
your spirit Mixing paints and 
molding clay can make you feel as 
carefree as you did when you were 
six. 

Just don't listen to your inncr- 
art-critic. Can't draw a straight 
line? Draw wavy ones. Or try fin- 
ger paints for a good, messy, tactile 
experience. 

A fun way to get back into cre- 
ative art-making is to remember 



built in sharpener that mom said 
you could get by without. 

If you end up spending a few 
bucks on a set of paints, jusi con- 
sider ii mental health maintenance. 
Recovering your inner-artist is ther- 
apeutic and necessary. 

Of course, releasing your cre- 
ativity in small ways such as these 
will have broad effects on every- 
thing else in your life It may cure 
your writer's block You'll brain- 
storm fantastic ideas for in ven lions 
or home decorating ideas. You'll 
suddenly look fabulous in red 
because your aura is spectral now 
instead of gray At least, that's one 
explanauon. 

So, indulge yourself wilh a little 
creative lime each week — it's good

A city of 
followers is 
challenged 

by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

Afier nearly five years of exis- 
tence and five coaching changes, 
the Fort Wayne Fury is finally back 
to square one. Gerald Oliver, the 
man who was hand-picked to lead 
the Fury in its first season, has 
descended from the from office to 
the sideline. There seems to be a 
renewed commitment on the part of 
the owners to bring a winner to 
Fort Wayne But we have seen this 
before, haven't we? 

In the beginning there was 
excitemem over the introduction of 
a new Continental Basketball 
Association team in Fort Wayne 
The so-called "experts" agreed. 
Fort Wayne was growing. The 
addition of another minor league 
professional sports learn could only 
raise the excitement. The owners of 
the team pursued in-state talent - 
OK, former Indiana University 
players - like a pirate searching for 
treasure. In the first season the 
piized catch was Jay Edwards, a 
mega-star at the high school level 
and a so-so player who couldn't 
handle the heal in Bob Knight's 
kitchen. The Fury signed him as a 
drawing card. 

The team's inaugural season 
was not spectacular, but neither 
were the seasons of most expansion 
clubs. Fans started getting restless. 
Ownership began shopping for 
another high-profile drawing card. 
Edwards was still touted as the 
franchise player. 

The team's second season was 
even worse, and fan loyalty dwin- 
dled further. On many nights you 
could hear not only the screech of 
shoes meeting the floor, but tbe 
calls made by the referees were as 
clear as tbe town crier In fact, that 
is exactly what Fury fans became, 
criers 

The "we want a winner, and we 
mean now" syndrome has been a 
thorn in the side of management 
since day one. Fort Wayne sports 
fans arc followers - meaning they 
will only support a front-runner. 
However, the syndrome affects not 
only those supposed professionals 
but also the college ranks. 

Witness the thud that echoed 
from Ihe Hillard Gates Sports 
Center last spring After enjoying 
great success during the Lloy Ball 
era. the men's volleyball team 
dropped from national notoriety to 
obscurity, and what had been one 
of tbe hottest tickets in town could 
hardly be given away. After lead- 
ing the nation in attendance and 
setting a new record for attendance 
at the Men's National Volleyball 
Championships, there was more 
than enough sitting room during the 
'Dons homegames. 

This year the IPFW women's 
basketball learn has earned one of 
the best records in the Midwest, 
and few fans have noticed. Those 
who have paid attention enjoy a 
front runner and get the action 
while its hot. 

Conversely, the Fury struggles 
to attract even sparse crowds. Even 
the addition of demi-god Damon 
Bailey has not helped The Komets 
have even begun losing fans. Fort 
Wayne likes a front-runner. 

It is sad. When a team is win- 
ning, the bandwagon can barely 
hold the masses. When teams lose, 
however, the wagon could float 
down the Maumce river. 

This week the IPFW athletic 
program is offering the chance for 
Fort Wayne to show its support for 
sports. On Saturday night, free 
admission is being extended to the 
entire community My challenge to 
the city of Fort Wayne is 10 prove 
me wrong by showing everyone 
that there is a true enthusiasm and 
interest in sports in this city. After 
all, it won't cost ya even a measly 
buck, unless of course you would 
like a bag of popcorn or a soda.

HIV virus claims another athlete's career 




Travis 
Stahl 



Morrison's 

promoter broke 



lim and then 
mnounced it to 



ihe 



iedia. 






And a dark shadow was cast 
over all the land consuming those 
who fell under il This destroyer of 
humanity knew neither gender nor 
race, only death - a death that can- 
not be slopped or slowed in its 
attempt to rampage 

Could HIV/AIDS be described 
in any other words as another of 
America's sports icons is gobbled 
up and spit out First Magic 
Johnson siaflled the world with his 
announcement of carrying ihe vims, 
then Arthur Ashe was stricken with 
the disease following a blood trans- 
fusion and now Tommy Morrison 
will lake his place among the sports 
minority who have contracted this 
dreaded virus and now must live 
with it. 

While preparing for his fight on 
Saturday. Morrison tested positive 
for the HIV antibody during a 
mandatory physical in Las Vegas. 



Both Morrison 
and his family 
arc hoping for 
an error in the 
^ty*-tc lest which is 

97 percent 
accurate. 
Three years 
ago when Morrison was tested 
before his bom with George 
Foreman, the results were negative, 
leaving a small window of hope for 
Ihe lighter and his family. 

Perhaps this incideni will open 
the eyes of athletes who choose to 
lead a promiscuous lifestyle. For 
Morrison, though, there will be no 
glonous comeback to the world of 
boxing like Magic Johnson's reium 
to basketball In a sport that 
requires the spilling of the oppo- 
nent's blood that would be impossi- 
ble - impossible for Morrison, his 
tr.um.p-. his sparring partners, and 
his opponents. The boxing life of 
Tommy Morrison is therefore dead 
This low in Morrison's life inter- 
rupted his plans for a bright future, 
including a possible fight worth 54 
million with Mike Tyson. 
Morrison, a iwo-ume liile holder, 



was baitered silly in his last fight 
against Lennox Lewis Does lhai 
pui Lewis at nsk for contracting ihe 
disease? And what aboui other 
opponents whom Morrison faced, 
whaiof Iheir falc? 

Tommy "The Duke" Morrison's 
up and down life mirrors that of his 
great uncle, John Wayne(whosc 
real name is Marion Morrison), 
While Wayne had tremendous suc- 
cess in his movie career, his life 
was also cut short by a terminal ill- 
ness in the form of cancer Wayne 
had lo slop filming movies twice, 
once to bave a cancerous lung 
removed, but he always relumed 
For Morrison, (hough, his career 
was on the up-swing following 
some embarrassing losses, and now 
this, his biggesl defeat of all. 

Morrison will no longer be tak- 
ing jabs from Foreman and Lewis; 
instead, he will be absorbing body 
blows from Life. It's a bailie that 
won'i end with ihe ringing of ihe 
bell in the twelfth round, but one he 
must fight non-stop. In a statement 
released by his promoter, Morrison 
asked not thai people pray for him 
but for the others who are stricken 
with this disease I bow my head 
and offer up a prayer for you. 
Tommy Morrison. May God be 
with you and your family in your 
struggle.
