Managing Editor 
If a letter 6ent to Tom Harris, former 
IPFW student body president, is any 
indication, IPFW could eventually 
receive full funding of a new fine arts 
facility here on campus. 

Steven Beering, Purdue University 
president, sent a letter to Tom Harris, 
Polly Dean, and Sharon Golm, all 
students at IPFW, expressing his 
support for their efforts in trying to 
obtain full funding of such a building. 
"Basically, this is the first time 
Purdue has said anything positive," 
said Harris. According to Harris, this 
supportiveness from Purdue could 
help persuade the House, Ways and 
Means Committee to increase the 50 
percent funding to the full 100 percent 
funding. 

In his letter, Beering said the 
Commission for Higher Education, the 
Slate Budget Agency, the leadership of 
the House and Senate and the 
Governor said not to submit any new 
budget requests in 1986. However, all 



1985 unfunded budget items are con- 
sidered existing capital expenditures. 

In the letter. Beering openly ex- 
pressed his support for full funding of a 
fine arts facility at IPFW. In part, the 
letter read: "Full funding of the 



building was part of our capital 
request for the 19B5 session of the 
General Assembly; it will remain part 
of our askings until it is funded.. ." 

Beering continued to say the IPFW 
fine arts building was a first priority 



Rally being planned 

By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

A press conference and rally are being planned to gain funding of the proposed 
fine arts building "We would like to see as many students comedown as possible," 
said Tom Harris. Details of the event will be published in The Communicator as 
they are released. 

While there is only a slight chance of getting funding for the fine arts building 
from this year's legislature, it is important to keep legislators aware of this need, 
said Harris. 

Since only emergency appropriations are normally considered during short 
sessions, our legislators have been hesitant to push the issue this year, said Harris. 
"The thing our legislators are waiting for is the gc-aheadfrom ( West) Lafayette," 
Harris said. 

Harris is also planning another letter-writing campaign. "Next year, we will be 
competing against Calumet, Indianapolis, and other campuses i for capital project 
funding)," Harris said. 



for Purdue in requesting funding from 
the state: "Since the Fort Wayne 
Campus Fine Arts Facility has been 
authorized for partial funding it ranks 
as our first priority among the current 
capital requests." 

Harris said how important it was for 
students and IPFW community 
members to move quickly on this. 
Saying how the letter from Beering 
was "incredible in its timing," he said 
if we wait until next year to push 
legislators for funding, we will have to 
Contend with competition from other 
campuses, like Purdue-Calumet and 
Indiana University Bloomington, 
which both will be requesting new 
funding for new buildings. Harris 
added another important factor in all 
this that 1986 is an election year, and 
thus would provide us an excellent 
opportunity to put pressure on area 
legislators. 

Supporters of the Fine Art6 Facility 
at IPFW are planning a press con- 
ference and a student rally to help 
raise funds for the building. A date and 
time will be announced later, ac- 
cording to Harris. 



Students' Government outlines spring activities 



Senate 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

Student Senate acted on several 
items ol old business including three 
fund-raising activities at its Jan, 15 
meeting. 

"We have hundreds of little 
mastodons which we need to dispose 
of," said Gina Kostoff, Students 
Government vice-president. Senators 
decided to sell the stuffed animals at 
upcoming athletic contests. 

Kostoff reminded senators of the 
buttonmaking equipment which senate 
purchased last year and encouraged 
senators to publicize this- program to 
various campus groups. "The buttons 
are very easy to make and any income 
we get is profit." she said. 

Student Senate voted to designate 
the profits from sales of Dine-a-Mate 
coupon books. Senators unanimously 
agreed to give the profits from this 
program to the Handicapped Student 
Council to assist them in their pur- 
chase of a vision enhancer for vision- 
impaired students. 

Senators approved a change in office 
policy. Senator Julia Knisely in- 



troduced a resolution to remove the 
secretary's phone and typewriter from 
the reception area when she is not 
working. The consensus was this would 
reduce excess wear on the equipment 
and reduce unauthorized long distance 
calls. 

Senator Carol Harber reported the 
proposal to make the "A" lot south of 
the library an "A-B" lot after 5:00 p.m. 
is not likely to be approved since there 
are many faculty who need to use it 
during the evening. 

Legal Services of Maumee Valley 
will begin counseling during February, 
said Kostoff. Students needing legal 
assistance should contact student 
services in Walb for more information 
or an appointment. 

In other business, Senate: 

adopted standing rules for use this 
semester; 

elected Patricia Patrick as president 
pro-tem; 

elected Earl Smith as clerk. 



SUBOG 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

Student Union Board of 



Governors (SUBOG) discussed spring 
activities at their meeting Jan. 15. 

"The ski trip to Colorado was quite 
successful and enjoyed by everyone 
but the travel chairman, Don Gorney, 
who was hospitalized for pneumonia," 
said SUBOG Chair Lisa Sewell. Plans 
for the annual spring trip to Daytona 
Beach are nearly finalized The trip is 
scheduled for spring break, March 8 
through 16. 

Board members expressed interest 
in using the profits from the Dorsey 
Concert for a Jazz concert this spring 
as well as a party at the Hoagland 
Hayloft during Harbor Arbor Days. 
Harbor Arbor Days have not been 
scheduled, but members feel it should 
be earlier than last year, when it 
conflicted with activities at the end of 
the semester. Consideration is being 
given to scheduling Greek Week at the 
same time as Harbor Arbor Days, said 
Sewell. 

Elizabeth Schlueter's board 

membership application was ap- 
proved. There are seven board seats 
still available for the spring semester. 
Sewell and Leanne Fredrick were 
chosen to represent IPFW at the 
convention of the National Association

King's birthday marked with special events 



By SCOTT L.NEUMAN 
Staff Writer 
During the week of Jan. 12-19, the 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial 
Observance Steering Committee, 
composed of community leaders, in 
conjunction with the Indiana 
University-Purdue University Black 
Collegian Caucus, co-sponsored 
several events to honor the birthday of 
the late Dr. King. 

Kicking off the week on Sunday, 
teams drawn from the Afro-Heritage 
Clubs of Elmhurst, North Side, Nor- 
throp, South Side, Wayne, and Snider 
high schools competed in the High 



School Bowl. The purpose of the Bowl 
was to test the knowledge of the par- 
ticipants on the subject of black 
history, focusing particularly on the 
life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Judging the event, from IPFW, were 
Dr. Sam White, chairman of the 
Engineering Department, and Marcia 
Edmond, assistant director of General 
Studies. Representing area high 
schools on the panel of judges were 
Tim Williams, a teacher at Elmhurst, 
and Romona Lavender, a guidance 
counselor at Snider High School. 

The competition, held in the Walb 
Memorial Union Building, consisted of 
three phases, all variations on a 



question-answer format. Phase one 
was a one-on-one with questions of the 
judges' choosing; phase two allowed 
the students to pre-select a category; 
and phase three allowed the judges to 
present clues to the questions. 

A first prize of $100 was awarded to 
Elmhurst High School. In addition, 
Northrop won a second prize of $50, 
and Wayne High School received a 
third prize of S25. 

Sandra Ellison, part of an advisory 
board for the project, said she feels the 
event was "a success," and adds, 
"we'd like to critique and improve the 
event, continuing it on an annual 
basis." She also feels the competition 



"provides an incentive to students to 
learn more about black history." 
Ellison doesn't believe the subject of 
black history is being adequately 
treated in the public schools. 

Other activities thet took place on 
and off campus in connection with the 
birthday of Dr. King include a 
documentary on the Poor People's 
campaign, a keynote address by 
Reverend Leon Sullivan, a slide 
presentation on the Civil Rights 
Movement by Dr. Louis Cantor, and a 
symposium on apartheid in South 
Africa held at the Public Library, 
downtown. 



New library director 
wants student feedback 



By JAMESE. GARCIA 
Staff Writer 

IPFW's new director of Library 
Services, Larry Griffin, says he is 
willing to meet with any group or in- 
dividual who might have suggestions 
on how the Helmke Library's services 
might be improved. 

"I am particularly interested in 
what the students have to say," said 
Griffin, who served as head of inter- 
library services at Indiana University, 
Bloomington, for 11 years before 
coming to IPFW. 

Griffin said he was attracted to the 
IPFW campus because "I felt there 
was strong support for library 
development by campus ad- 
ministrators." He added, "The Fort 
Wayne campus is one of the best in the 
system." 

In order to talk with those whom the 
library serves, Griffin has asked for a 
meeting with members of Students 
Government. Griffin is also looking 
forward to meeting with the faculty. 



Much of what the new director has 
planned as future improvements for 
the Helmke Library will be based on a 
report prepared for IPFW by Robert 
G. Sewell. a library consultant from 
the University of Illinois. The report 
examined the library's collection and 
methods of selecting books and 
magazines. 

Griffin believes librarians should 
have more power in selecting which 
books will be bought for the library, 
since they work with the students 
everyday. He feels the manner in 
which money Is appropriated to the 
various departments in the campus 
system should be discussed. He would 
also like to see a better facility created 
for housing the fine arts collections of 
books. 

Computers are an Inevitable part of 
the library's future, says Griffin. How 
Boon computerization takes place 
depends only on the pragmatics of 
installing such a system. Space and the 
subsequent need for more staffing lo

Degree from the University of

Thursday. Jan. 23. 1986 



Support finally arrives 
from West Lafayette 



1PFW could receive full funding of a 
fine arts building on campus if a letter 
from Purdue University President Steve 
Beering can be viewed as a positive sign. 

Recently, Beering sent a letter to 
IPFW students Tom Harris, Polly Dean 
and Sheri Go!m supporting their efforts 
and expressing his concern for funding 
of a fine arts building. This is essentially 
the first lime Purdue University has said 
anything positive about IPFW's 
attempts to gain full funding. This could 
mean a lot to IPFW and the future of fine 
arts in Fort Wayne. 

First of all, the legislators have been 
waiting for hints of support from West 
Lafayette. With this letter in hand, we 
might be able to convince the House, 
Ways and Means Committee to increase 
the funding of our fine arts building from 
50 percent to 100 percent funding. 

Of course, there is the problem that 
some people will say, "But the General 
Assembly does not want to approve any 
new capital expenditures for higher 
education this year." That is true; 
however, funding for an IPFW fine arts 
facility is not a new proposal. It is an 
existing capital expenditure 

This Friday, students will organize 
downtown at the Fine Arts building for a 
student rally-fundraiser for a fine arts 
facility. This is an important step. It is 
essential that anyone who cares about 
the funding for a fine arts facility get 
involved. 



Why? There are several reasons: 
1. If we wail until next year to lobby 
for this ex Ira money, we will be 
competing with other Indiana colleges, 
like Purdue University at Calumet and 
Indiana University Btoominglon. Their 
needs could very easily be placed above 

2 Right now, we have got their 
attention. The liming of Beering's letter 
was perfect. This could be a great tool 
for us to use to show Indiana Legislators 
that Purdue does support our efforts. 

3. 1986 is an election year. Tf students 
and other IPFW community members 
push this and bring it above water, 
rather lhan let it slide by, we would be 
putting pressure on area legislators to do 
something. 

A new fine arts building at IPFW is an 
essential and very important step for the 
university. But, it is not something that 
will be handed to us on a silver platter. 
We have worked hard to get the attention 
of area legislators and Purdue 
University representatives. We have got 
to work even harder to get what we 
really want â full funding of a fine arts 
facility. We have to show legislators that 
we care, that we are interested in 
IPFW's improvement. 

Remember, you will only get out of 
this school what effort you put into it. 
IPFW is giving you an education. Help 
give IPFW a fine arts building.

Discrimination prevails 



1985: Some stood tall, others sniffed by 



The halls of America's universities are 
not shining examples of widening 
opportunities for the country's 
minoritiesâ blacks, hispanics, Puerto 
Ricans, Mexican-Americans and 
American-Indians. 

In 1979, the percentage of blacks 
among faculties in the U.S. was at 4.3 
percent. In 1981, reports showed a 
-decline to 4.2 percent. The same report, 
fifrom the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, showed a 
small growth of one percent, to 27.6 
percent, of the number of women in 
faculty positions Where the women are 
is in a cluster of small fields, typically 
"feminine." Some of these are fields like 
English, foreign languages, nursing, 
home economics, fjne arts and library 
sciences. 

The same problem exists in student 
enrollment nationwide. In 1979, blacks 
seeking master's degrees were awarded 
only 6.5 percent of all degrees awarded. 
In 1981, that figure dropped to 5.8 
percent, down .7 percent from 1979. 

Even among students, minorities are 
segregated in certain subject areas. In a 
survey of 1,000 blacks at the Slate 
University of New York, more than 600 
were in education. However, just 29 were 
in physical science, six in math, and only 
one was in computer sciences. 

Reasons for these declines cannot be 
perfectly explained. Perhaps the 
reduction of student financial aid could 
be one cause. However, a growing lack 
of concern toward enforcing equal 
opportunities for all could be a cause to 
both problems. 



In 1983, the Reagan Administration 
argues, in the Supreme Court case of 
Grove City College v. Bell, that a college 
could still receive federal aid even if 
some of its departments were guilty of 
discrimination. 

Another, more recent example of lax 
enforcement of affirmative action 
programs is U.S. Attorney General 
Edwin Meese's proposal to change a 20- 
year-old affirmative action cornerstone, 
Executive Order 11246. Meese wants to 
change the proposal so that employees 
with $50,000 or more in federal contracts 
would no longer have to set timetables or 
anything else to employ minorities and 
women. 

This proposal of Meese's would also 
forbid government to use statistical 
evidence to show that a person with a 
government contract is discriminating 
against minorities. How else are we 
going to find out? And why should these 
people continue lo receive contracts 
from the government if they are not 
complying with federal equal 
employment opportunity guidelines? 

How can we prevent further 
discrimination if people aren't required 
to follow goals and timetables? Since our 
government just recently celebrated a 
new national holiday in honor of Martin 
Luther King, Jr.,'s birthday, it seems 
strange that they would not punish 
people who purposely discriminate in 
employee selection. 

Maybe some day our country will rise 
up and live up to the ideal that all men 
are created equal. But it hasn't yet. 
Keep the dream alive, America.

Violette Vernaud Meyers of 
the IPFW Music Depart- 
ment. 

The couple developed a 
rapport with the audience by 
giving an introduciory ex- 

â  planation before each 

â  number and by providing 
translations to the songs 
sung in German. 

The recital consisted of 
; songs excerpted froni a 
variety of operas. The first 
number, sung by Mr. 
; Meyers, was "total Eclipse" 



by G.F Handel. It was from 
the oratiorio "Samson" and 
was about a man losing his 
sight. Many of the other 
songs chosen by Mr. Meyers 
were solemn, like this 
example. 

Mrs. Meyers' introductory 
numbers were romantic and 
light-hearted and prepared 
the audience for the playful, 
yet somewhat serious 
number that came next: 

Nine songs from 



Italienisch Liederbuch" by 
Hugo Wolf were performed 
by both Joseph and Violette 
Meyers in a delightful 
dialogue form. The Nine 
Songs from the Italian 
Songbook were about an 
ardent suitor and his 
serenading a beautiful young 
woman who is not al all 
amused. In the songs, the 
woman explains that she 
would "rather hear a 
donkey'sserenade." 



Kathy Shanklin, ac- 
companying pianist, added 
to the aural experience by 

ploying an appropriate "hee- 
haw" sound on the piano. 

Assisting the Myers was 
Larry Passin, clarinetist, 
who performed selections 
from "Six Studies in English 
Folksong" by R. Vaughn 
Williams The gentle, rolling 
tone of the clarinet brought 
forth images of the English 
countryside, traveling 



Meyers share passion for music 



V MICHELLE M. BANDOR 

St afr Writer 
Joseph K. Meyers Is an 

Associate Professor of Music 
at IPFW and teaches solo 
voice He is the director of 
the Opera Workshop. His 
wife, Violette Vernaud 
Meyers, is an associate 
faculty member and also 
directs the Opera Workshop. 
Their past is as romantic 
as some of the songs they 
sing. . the two met while 
studying at the Vienna Aca- 
demy of Music in Austria. 
Some of the songs they le- 
arned while under the 



tutelage of the famous Dr 
Werba were inspiration for 
Sunday's recital. 

Nine songs from "Das 
Italienische Liederbuch" 
were some of the songs that 
brought back memories of 
their courting days. Meyers 
told of how Dr. Werba would 
coach him in his in- 
terpretation of these love by 
saying, "Be more passionate 
Meyers Think of Vernaud." 

Last summer, the Meyers 
travelled to Sienna, Italy and 
worked with some very 
talented American students 
from the Juillard School of 



Art and Temple University. 
They followed a rigious 
schedule while in Sienna and 
gave 15 concerts within five 
weeks. During this time they 
were able to sing in the 
Cathedral at Assissi. 

The Myers' love for their 
art reverberates throughout 
the community. Their 
energy and enthusiasm 
translates into a Si ,000.00 
scholarship for music 
students. They work with a 
local organization in per- 
forming operas and recitals 
in order to raise the 
scholarship money. 



toward the bustling towns as 
the pace of the tunes picked 
up. 

"Deborah," a number 
sung by Mr. Meyers, dealt 
with the ravages of time on a 
young girl The song has a 
surprise ending and Meyers 
plays along with it perfectly 
in his emotional in- 
terpretation. He sings the 
song in a light- 
hearted, energetic way to 
portray the girl's youth and 
then turns somber in tone to 
give the feeling of impending 
death. What a surprise when 
we realize the song is about a 
spritely two-year-old 
maturing into an old lady of 
three! 

"Come Live With Me an 
Artist's Life," a song of 
anticipated hardships that 
only true love and hard work 
can conquer, was their 
closing selection. 

This Strauss song, the 
couple explained, exem- 
plified their lives 
togetherâ they have chosen 
not to chase material wealth, 
but to pursue a more per- 
sonal wealthâ their music 
and each other's happiness.

I'd ordered the chicken with almonds, one of my personal favorites â I've never 
been disappointed with this wonderful mixture of mushrooms, chicken, almonds,

In my entree, the plump and thickly sliced mushrooms and firm chunks of green 
peppers mingled with an abundance of chicken morsels. Fresh chives, tender 
cubes of diced carrots and transparent slices of onion added lo the aroma of this 
dish, while a generous sprinkling of blanched almonds provided a satisfying

Ohio State wins Fort Wayne National Bank volleyball classic 



: The Ohio Stale Volleyball 
squad looked awesome while 
rolling over 1PFW, 15-6, 15- 
II, 15-9, in the title game of 
the Fort Wayne National 
Bank Classic, last weekend 
""With the exception of the 
second game, the Buckeyes 
were never really pushed as 
the Volleydons committed 



several unforced errors and 
had trouble serving 

throughout the whole con- 
test. 

"'It was the first time we 
have played at home this 
season," said Coach Arnie 
Ball, "and we just didn't 
concentrate. They had a 
great defense and they were 
just the better team. There is 
no such thing as a good loss, 



but this showed where we 
need some work." 

In the Ohio Slate match- 
up, Jay Goldsteyn had IS 
kills, while Ojars Berzins 
had 1! digs. 

On Friday night, the 

Volleydons outlasted the 
University of Guelph, 15-9, 
15-9, 13-15, 5-15 and 15-7. 
Junior Ted Owen had 15 kills 
and Phil Bodine contributed 



35 assists. 

In Saturday morning's 
action, IPFW defeated the 
University of Arkansas. 
Little Rock, 15-9, 15-}, 15-5. 
i.i'ldsii'jn had four aces and 
Phil Bodine had 30 assists. 

Ohio Sta^e defeated 

Arkansas, 15-2, 15-6, 15-14, 
and Guelph, 15-6, 15-7, 15-11, 
enroute to the title game. 
The All-Tournament team 



consisted of Loren Gebert 
and Ted Owens lIPFW); 
Dave Baldois and Mike 
Childs of Guelph; and Mark 
Edinger. Jim Keller and

started to scrap their way 
back into the game. And' 
Scrap the Mastodons did. 
Playing aggressive defense, 
IPFW held the Greyhounds 
to 10 baskets in 18 attempts 
inthehalf. 

The Mastodons had four 
players in double figures as 
Morlan and Bruce Erwin 
tied for high-point honors

On a unique note, all three

Tim Russell said, "It wasn't 
a pretty game, but it's a win 
and we'll take it . On defense, 



our men played well. They 
knew where they were 
supposed to be and they got 
the job done. We didn't play 
well offensively but we 
played well as a unit on 
defense." 
On Saturday, Southern 



Indiana defeated the 

Mastodons, 59-57, despite a 
great comeback effort on the 
part of IPFW. The 
Mastodons trailed by 18 
points in the second half 
before starting their charge, 
and pulled into a tie in the 



late minutes of the game.
