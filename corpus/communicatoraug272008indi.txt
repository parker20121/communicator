± he trail to get this 
far was one of emotion, 
trial and tribulation. But 
the end to this winding 
road was purely golden. 

For the United States 
volleyball team, it was 
a big strike in what was 
the final pitch for many. 
For head coach Hugh 
McCutcheon it was a 
sweet ending to a bitter 
two weeks. For setter 
Lloy Ball and the IPFW 
athletics family, it was 
finally an unprecedented 
moment of closure. 

The United States had 
previously won Olympic 
gold, first in the Soviet- 
less 1984 games and 
again with all-time great 
Karch Kiraly leading 
the way in 198B. They 
grabbed Bronze in 1992's 
Barcelona games but 
hadnt tasted a medal 
since Success in the 
medal rounds has also 
eluded Ball, who made 
his Olympic debut during 
Atlantas 1996 games. 

He has taken plenty 
of hardware during his 
national team career as a 
14 -year starter, including 
making his international 
debut in the 1995 Pan- 
American Games. But 
nothing as sweet as 
Olympic gold. 

Ail of the struggle 
ended Sunday afternoon, 
Beijing time, when Ball 
helped anchor a three 
game to one victory 
for the United States. 
The win over Brazil in 
the gold medal match 
helped close the games 
of the 29th Olympiad. 
And likcvise, it set a new 
standard here at IPFW, a 
school rich in volleyball 
tradition but one that 
had never achieved a 
success like this witli any 
other athlete.

year IPFW lost two stu- 
dents by homicide. He 
was refering to the on- 
campus death of Llette 
"Tina" Martinez and 
the off-campus death of 
Frederick Jones. 

Wartell extended 
sympathies to the fami-

students. He said: "We 
have Increased security; 
and we have come clos-

attacks. In this article

Getting involved with the IPFW Student Government 



By KoiJyTinnel 

Ituprei6ipfw.edu 



I paid for what? It's the 
popular phrase that we 
as IPFW students have 
come to be pleasantly 
annoyed by. For those 
in college it is especially 
obvious that the cost of 
higher education could 
be much lower, but this 
problem occurs with 
every University in the 
country. So why docs 
IPFW seem to be singled 
out with regards to school 
costs? 

While i vrill never claim 
to be an expert on where 
all of your tuition money 
goes here at IPFW. I do 
know about the money 
that the Indiana- Purdue 
Student Government As- 
sociation (IPSGA) ban- 
dies. Each student pays 
Student Activity Fees. 
The amount you pay de- 
pends on the number of 
credit hours you are cur- 
rently enrolled in. IPSGA 
gets to allocate just over 
a million dollars of this 
money each year. 

You may be asking 
yourself where all of this 
money actually goes. An- 
nual allocations by IPSGA 
help to fund programs 
like First Year Experience, 
the Writing Cenler, and 
numerous others. Stu- 
dent Activity Fee money 
also helps pay for the 
health clinic on campus 
and the Communicator, 




to name just a few. 

In addition to items 
funded from the annual 
budget, IPSGA spends 
more money tlirough- 
out [he school year The 
Student Activities Board 
uses student money to 
bring performers and 
free food lo campus in 
order to add a little ex- 
citement to the some- 
times boring days full 
of those pesky classes. 
Money is also available 
for student organizations 
to put on events. And just 
last spring the new Stu- 
dent Senate TVavel Fund 
was established, which 
now offers any students 
the chance to receive 
money to go on trips to 



conferences or special 
educational events. 

So from the perspective 
of Student Government, 
the answer to the origi- 
nal question of "1 paid 
for what?" is pretty clear. 
Students at IPFW pay for 
a quality education as 
well as many other op- 
portunities to advance 
themselves in different 
ways. They key to getting 
what you pay for is to 
take advantage of these 
opportunities.

Spotlight on Local Activism 



By Shane Lee 

Politics S Money Editor 

This will be a weekly 
column in which The 
Communicator devotes 
space to a local organi- 
zation that is taking ac- 
tion to promote peace 
or awareness of a spe- 
cific nature. The short 
and long terms goals as 
well as the activities of 
the organization will be 



summarized in order to 
give them some time in 
the limelight and media 
awareness to encourage 
IPFW students to activ- ■ 
ism. If you know of any 
local organizations, or 
are a member of one in 
which IPFW students 
can or do participate in 
e-mail us and we will 
spotlight them in an up- 
coming issue. Remem-

Top Ten... 

Things You'll Learn in School This Semester 

American History: While Indiana became a slate in 1816. Kentucky was cre- 
ated in 1952 as a marketing gimmick to help sell fried chicken. 

Public Speaking: Talking to a crowd may scare you, but talking lo yourself 
scares everyone else. 

Criminology: Despite the name, "criminology" will not teach you how to be a 
criminal. Try taking political science. 

Geography: Russia is at war with tlie country of Georgia, not the state. Don't 
worry; the Atlanta Falcons are safe. 

Philosophy: said, "I think, therefore I am." Apparently, most of the people I 
know don't actually exist. 

Calculus: Never mind. Calculus jokes are so derivative. 

Astronomy: The moon is over 2,000 miles in diameter. To get a better idea of 
just how big that is, imagine a kitten playing with a ball of string the size of the 
moon. 

English; Leaving out just a couple letters can change the entire meaning of 
your paper. What you meant to write was "I love it when girls hit ON me." 

Health: "Bird watchers" are completely different than "weight watchers." One 
group loves nature, and the other group hates it when you bring binoculars lo 
the gym. 

Women's studies: The feminist movement probably would have been more 
successful if Susan B. Anthony had just dressed a little nicer.

A gift wrapped hug from a sick puppy 



By Shane Lee 

Pal)Uu &amp; Money Edilor 



You may have heard of 
a newup and coming rock 
band called the Sick Pup- 
pies, are more familiar 
widi their breakout claim 
to fame, the "Free Hugs" 
video. Their singer creat- 
ed this video for his friend 
luan Mann, the founder 
of Free Hugs, which in- 
cluded music from their 
upcoming album. It soon 
took off and received sev- 
eral million views, thus 
catapulting tlie band and 
the movement into the 
spotlight. 

The Communicator 
recently had an opportu- 
nity to sit doivn with the 



members of Sick Puppies, 
who were opening up for 
Seether at Piere's. Shimon 
Moore, the singer/gui- 
tarist seemed to be the 
most outspoken of the 
trio which also includes 
Emma Anzai on bass and 
Mark Goodwin on drums. 

Shane Lee Baer- 
lin- Tell me about the 
Free Hugs Campaign. 
Shimon Moore - Sure. Be- 
fore we moved over here. 
Emma and I moved over 
here about three years 
ago. We hadn't met Mark, 
we had an old drummer 
who decided not to come 
with us and we were sav- 
ing up money that we 
used for the trip because 
we didn't have a record la- 
bel at the time. Emma was 



working telemarkedng 
and 1 was working this job 
holding a sandwich board 
sign that advertised two 
for one shoes and I met 
this guy giving out free 
hugs while 
I was doing 
the same 
thing ivith " 
my sign. So 
I just met 
lluan) and 
we became 
friends and 
I video- 
taped him 
with my 
dad's cam- 
era as sort 
of a social 

experiment. I had these 
tapes, nothing ever hap- 
pened with them and we 
were over in the slates 




making "Dressed up as 
Life," he called me up and 
told me that his grand- 
mother had passed away. 
So I put together these 
videos as a get well card 
for him, like 
a video get 
well card 
and CD and 
sent it off to 
him and af- 
ter it was all 
done we put 
it on You- 
Ibbe so we 
could show 
a few other 
people and 
it became 
a big over- 
night success and sud- 
denly we were a band that 
everyone was interested 
in for a few weeks and we 



got to release an album 
and go on tour. 

SLB- So have you guys 
participated in the cam- 
paign other than the vid- 
eo? 

SM- The video was just 
a fluke, it was something 
that just happened. It 
wasn't any planned move- 
ment or motivation it was 
a just a thing that hap- 
pened. 

SLB- So did you guys find 
it shocking that the video 
became such a huge hit? 

SM- Yeah, definitely But 
it's all a blessing, it's all 
good stuff and the bottom 
line is more people heard 
our music because of it. 



SLB- It seems like the 
campaign benefitted as

SM- Yeah, the campaign 
ivasn't really doing any- 
thing up until the video in 
terms of mass public ap-

wasn't doing anything, 
we had yet to release our

pened serendipitously for 
both of us. 

SLB- So what was going 
through your head the 
first time you saw Juan 
Mann and free hugs sign?

The Great Duck 
Wood Fire School 



In the imagina- 
tion world of The 
Great Duck Wood Fire 
School by artist Doug- 
las Baldwin, miniature 
ducks are spending all 
of their days and some 
nights working in the 
heat, consumed with 
Uieir labor, camaraderie, 
and the process of wood 
firing. Stoking wood and 
enduring heat from ce- 
ramic kilns that reach 
thousands of degrees, the 
working environment for 
the whimsical potters is a 
hell only they would seem 
to enjoy. 

Skimming through the 
world is a shame - if only 
the consciousness al- 
lowed one to stop and ob- 
serve the process behind 
the pieces. The craftsman- 
ship looks simple, almost 
childlike, yet. undoubt- 
edly time consuming and 
repetitive.

unique and mosdy satiri- 
cal world can be a chal- 
lenge. Each piece of work

An 

uncomfortably 
wonderful 
clay world 

By Said EL-Dajani 



Firing School 
is a siory of its o\&lt;m. 
While die majority' of his 
work is of a low-fire terra- 
cotta medium, tlie slofies 
in his clay environments 
each provide a symbolic 
approach to the labor in- 
tensive and self-impor- 
tani human condition be- 
hind wood firing. 

Each duck has a role, 
an emotion, or expres- 
sion. Mosdy celebrating 
or downplaying their ef- 
forts, the comical creature 
in which Baldivin exploits, 
sadrizes the commercial- 
ism of ceramics to the ro- 
mantic process of wood 
firing. 

"People in ceramics 
are obsessed with wood 
firing," Associate Profes- 
sor of Ceramics, Nancy 



McCroskey said. 
"there is a social aspect 
where people are working 
together as a team." 

As apposed to the gas 
or electric kiln, which you 
can step away from, wood 
firing requires constant 
nurturing to maintain 
the high temperatures. 
Baldwin's work, which 
does not demand such 
treatment, clearly has an 
understanding for the 
method and more impor- 
tantly, a passionate ap- 
preciadon. ' 

McCroskey was once 
a student to Baldwin and 
the force in bringing his 
woric to the Visual Arts 



Gallery. 
Considering Bald- 
win a mentor, she pro- 
duced a piece of wridng 
that so eloquently paint- 
ed a picture ensuring him 
some gallery space here at 
IPFW. 

"Doug's signature im- 
age, 'The Duck,' was de- 
veloped a few years be- 
fore I became a student. 
Art as satire, a recurring 
theme in his work, was 
realized early on when he 
put a duckhead on a mold 
made image of Gainsbor- 
ough's 'The Blueboy' The 
vain and supercilious 



'blue boy' with an army 
helmeted duck head is re- 
vealed to be just one the 
ducks in the army! I saw 
many wonderfid 'Duck' 
sculptiu-es combirung 
molded handmade parts 
and even managed to ac- 
quire a few that he donat- 
ed to the annual ceram- 
ics fiindraiser. Doug gave 
so much of himself to 
the program! After a trip 
to Greece in the 1970s, 
Doug's work further 
evolved aware from the 
use of molds to entirely 



hand 
made 
imagery. Doug 
says he, 'came to a realiza- 
don that teaching allows 
me the luxury of not hav- 
ing to sell my work. I can 
create what I want - not 
what the market tells me 
to make.' "

chair of the Department 
of Theater, to ask them 
about this year's upcom- 
ing events. Susan Corner 
says that she "works to 
create an audience for 
the various performanc-

bitions, and media, to 
education in the form of 
various classes. 

The college offers 
classes in drawing and 
ceramics for students 
who are not majoring in 
those areas, as well as art 
appreciation classes that

that this year's theater 
productions will give 
students, those perform-

Freshman Fest, 

rocked? 

Two days dedicated to more 
than just free food 



By Kelly McLendon 

staff Writer 



The day was sunny and 
bright, which seemed lo be u 
redecljon of ihe warm wel- 
come that awaited students 
on the liTSl day of Freshmen 
Fest on August 21st. 

It all began with check- 
in, held ul the Walb Student 
Union, where attendees also 
got a chance lo pick up Ihcir 
new ID cards. 

The even I (hen moved 
lo ihc Rhinchan Center al 
10:30 a.m.. where Student 
Body President Kody Tun- 
nel gave a brief speech 
aboui gelling Involved and 
the imponuncc of attending 
class. Tinnel's speech was 
followed up by an energetic 
introduction by Hagi Brad- 
ley, who is Assistant Direc- 
tor of Student Life. 

Bradley's wild enthusi- 
asm revved up the crowd for 
a scries of skits by a group 
of orientation assistants. The 
skits discussed how Judging 
people by the way they look 
might not always be accu- 
rate to the real personality of 
that person. One orientation 
assistant's character wisely 
said, "Sec past stereotypes." 
The main message was 
meant to urge new students 
not to judge on first appear- 
ance and try to be open- 
minded about meeting new 
people. 

Bradley restated the 
message by saying. "Don't 
judge on first appearance. 
If you judge them from the 
beginning, you're going 
to miss out." He wanted to 
convey the importance of 
meeting new people, but not 
holding any apprehension 
from the beginning. 

Bradley could relate 
well with frc.shmen in the 
way that it is his first year at 
IPfTV, too. 

After the skit show, stu- 
dents were directed to lake 
the traditional class photo in 
which l-P-F-W is spelled out 
with that year's class. Fol- 
io w'mg the event, students 
could finally get the free 
food they had been waiting 
all morning for. try out the 
rock wall and other carnival 
games, and maybe gel some 



information from various 
student organizations. 

When asked the likely 
question why Freshmen 
Fest is important. Bradley 
said, "Freshmen Fest is a 
wonderful way for us to 
welcome the new students 
into the IPFW family, giv- 
ing them this opportunity to 
meet other new students and 
to begin their college jour- 
ney on a positive note." 

Audrey Moore, Direc- 
tor of Student Life said this 
year's Freshmen Fest was 
the founh year of the pro- 
gram. 

Moore also said there 
was a"2% increase in SOAR 
attendees this year," obvi- 
ously delighted thai more 
new students are choosing 
to get involved with Student 
Life right away. 

A few minutes before 
the event started, freshman 
Amanda Smith, who plans 
to major in Elementary Edu- 
cation said. "I don't really 
know what to expect. I'm 
hoping to meet new people, 
and free food would be nice 

The top two answers at- 
tendees staled for the rea- 
sons they decided to attend 
Freshmen Fest included get- 
ting free food and meeting 




While Smith didn't 
know what to expect, 
she stilt feels her first 
year of college is go- 
ing lo be great at 
IPFW. -rm not re- 
ally scared because 
I've been around 
campus before. 
I took college 
courses at IPFW 
my senior year." 
she said. 

As the Student 
Body President 
said, getting in- 
volved is the 
first and best 
step to hav- 
ing a success- 
ful first year at 
college. This 
year's freshmen 
seemed lo em^ 
brace that 
sage; as some 
showed up to 
the fest already 
sporting IPFW 
tees. If the 
was any indi 
lion, enrollment is up. 
which means there will be 
more students with even 
more ideas for change than 
before. So, incoming fresh- 
men, get involved. Have a 
good time and -welcome to 
college Class of 2012.

Take advantage of what you pay for 



Growing up in Ihc Fori Wayne 
came to understand ihal fPFW 
cd with Ihc phrase. "I paid for what?" It was 
Ihc lirsl thing that came lo mind for most 
people when someone decided lo attend the 
university. The siereotypc made me a bit 
nervous about coming here, however I was 
pleasantly surprised when I realized what I 
uciually gel for my money. I pay for: 

I . A Great Education. I know that sounds 
like the typical, sugarcoaied. thanks for tell- 
ing me what I already know response from 
someone who is talking about their univer- 
sity, but it really is true. For approximately 
$7,000 a year, I have the opportunity to earn 
a degree from cither Indiana University or 
Purdue University without actually going lo 
Bloominglon or West Lafayette. Instead of 
being placed in classes with 200 plus stu- 
dents like several of my high school buddies 
who attended larger institutions my fresh- 
man year. I haven't been enrolled in a class 
with more than 30 students. Common sense 
tells me that I may have received a bit more 
personal attention from my professors than 
they did. I mean, 1 guess I could be wrong, 
but generally you get more personal atten- 
tion from professors who don't have a 200- 
student class. Lucky us! I don't know about 



you. but I like not being just another student 
number. I have a name thank you very much 
and 1 like when my professors know and use 

2. Dedicated &amp; Available Professors. 
While there could be some exceptions to 
this claim, I have had for the most part very 
dedicated professors. The fint day of all of 
my classes I receive the contact informa- 
tion of my professors. They give out their 
e-mail addresses, office phone numbers, of- 
fice hours and some 



even give out their 
cell phone numbers. 
They give you al- 
most every option 
available to contact 
them. They want to 

help students learn ___^_^__^__ 

and do a lot to make 

sure they arc available and easy to contact. 
This is a big plus for students, especially if 
you find yourself confused about an assign- 
ment or needing extra help in a subject. Ba- 
sically, my assessment of professors here is 
thai ihey like their jobs and take them seri- 
ously. Students can only benefit from this. 

3. Key to Events. Yes there really is a 
key of sorts lo events going on here at IPFW. 



"They also give you the right 

of free food, which everyone 

should be enjoying during their 

first week back at school." 



Welcome to the pages of The 
Communicator. 

Somehow you have managed to 
grapple onto one of these obscure 
newspapers; more than likely skimmed 
threw a few headlines, paused at some 
visual elements. Yet, is it enough that 
the words are not off a computer 
screen, that your news is not supported 
by sound biles and video feeds? Maybe, 
if you imagined this piece being read 
by Morgan Freeman, would you be 
interested then? 

Slighdy beyond our network of 
"friends" and conversations of the 
mainstream, is the college newspaper. 
While many of us subscribe to blogs 
online, receive upwards of a hundred 
text messages a day, and check 
our Facebook profiles obsessively, 
somehow we are siuU forced to pick up 
the tangible. 

For many of you who have been 
around IPFW for longer than expected 
have experienced The Communicator 



Sincerely, 



Back to school and being older 



By Gretchen Hahti 

The isles of the local 
Target stores are jam- 
packed with yellow Cray- 
ola boxes, right-handed 
scissors, spiral notebooks, 
and Mead Trapper Keep- 
ers.. .oh if only it was that 
simple! Tis the real world 
of a S432 check written 
out to Follet's bookstore, 
countless nights of wor- 
i^ng when that student 
loan check will appear 
in your dwindling check- 
ing account, and for me, 
wondering how old I'm 
going to appear to the 
new generation of stu- 
dents gracing the IPFW 
campus this fall. 

Deciding to go hack 
lo the academic world 



after a short (two year) 
break from the college 
life, takes quite a toll on 
some, myself included. I 
decided to finally reenlist 
in classes after staying 
home with my two small 
children for the past 
two years, and realizing 
that although I loved the 
quality time 1 spent with 
my children, it was time 
to set a better example 
for them. 

1 took three classes 
during second summer 
session and realized I was 
definitely not the only re- 
turning student, but only 
after sitting myself next 
to the youngest girl in the 
class, thinking she had to 
be about my age.. .later 
I'd find out she was seven 
years my junior. Perhaps 



the blue fingernail polish 
should have been the first 
indicator! Although I've 
already made some in- 
credible new friends (my 
age!) I can't help but won- 
der if I'm really equipped 
for all that is yet to come 
this fall semester. I'm en- 
rolled in fifteen hours, 
and already have minia- 
ture panic attacks as to 
how I'll balance school 
life and home life. 

Although I'm ex- 
tremely apprehensive 
as to how this semester 
will resolve itself, I'm 
confident I'm doing the 
right thing. Not to men- 
tion that I'm secredy ob- 
sessed with new pencils, 
paper, color-coding, and 
labeling my school ac- 
cessories! Sssshhhl 



I'll give you a few hints... all students have 
one. they are blue and they have your pholo 
on it from most likely your freshman year. 
If you haven't guessed it yet, I'll help you 
out, the key to tlie IPFW city is your Ma.st- 
odon ID Card. It unlocks free admission to 
all Division One sports events, theater pro- 
ductions and almost every other event held 
on campus. They also give you the right of 
free food, which everyone should be enjoy- 
ing during their first week back at school. 

This is pretty amaz- 

ing because at most 
universities, they 
require you lo pur- 
cha.se tickets and 
pay admission to 
these events. Thank 
you IPFW for un- 
derstanding that 
! budget and for real- 



most students 

tzing that by waiving these fees you're say- 
ing you want us there. This leads to glorious 
things such as making new friends, increas- 
ing school spirit and superfanning (a term Sincerely, 
used to describe Mastodon sports fans who 
dress crazily for games to support teams). 

4. Ways for Everyone to be Involved. 
With over 150 clubs. Student Government, 



The Communicator. Division One sports 
leams and many other groups, it's hard not 
to find a place to fit in. Let's state the obvi- 
ou.s, everyone is different and Uicreforc have 
varying interests, opinions, and the like. So 
it only makes sense that IPFW welcomes 
diversity with open arms allowing the in- 
siatcmeni of these often student led organi- 
zations. Since these have been so graciously 
provided for all of us. don't we owe it to 
ourselves lo get into at least one of them? 
Trust me from experience, getting involved 
will lead lo meeting more people and creat- 
ing fricnd.ships thai will last a lifetime. They 
also significantly enhance your college ex- 
perience! 

Well there you have it, what I've listed 
above is a significantly broad overview of 
the benefits IPFW students pay for. So if 
you happen lo hear someone use the phrase, 
"I paid for what?" I'm sure you can agree 
with me and respond with, "Actually a loL 
Jealous?"

Pierce named as Gernon's 
IPFW dugout replacement 



By Jessica Williams 

SporU Wrllei 

The month long search for a newhead 
baseball coach is over. Bobby Pierce 
has been hired to take over the reigns 
from former coach Billy Gemon, who 
is now an assistant coach at Michigan 
State. 

Gernon finished the 2008 Mastodon 
season 14-36-2, with a Summit League 
record of 10-17. His career record with 
IPFW is 157-275-2 in nine seasons. 

Pierce comes from a successful two- 
year career at Metro State College in 
Denver, Colorado. "Rvo of his players 
earned All-American honors last year, 
and 11 earned All -Conference honors. 
During Pierce's two seasons with Metro 
State, he accumulated a 55-54 record, 
including a 43-34 league record. 
- "We had a tremendous candidate 
pool of over 46 people for the baseball 
head coaching position," IPFW Athletic 
Director Tommy Bell said in a press 
release. "During the interview process, 
the committee and myself realized 



:;iy c\L.iicu ituifLii 

m 



that Bobby had all the knowledge and 
experience to move IPFW baseball 
forward to be a consistent contender 
year in and year out in the Summit 
League, i am extremely excited about 
the leadership and 
direction Bobby 
brings to IPFW." 

Before coaching at 
Metro State, Pierce 
was an assistant 
coach at Central 
Arizona College. 
He then moved on PJERCE 
to work primarily 
as a hitting coach at the University of 
Arkansas-Little Rock, where nine of 
the players he helped coach went on to 
play professionally. The UALR Trojans 
increased their batting average by 41 
points between 2004 and 2006 (.257 to 
,298). 

"The IPFW baseball program has 
had a lot of good people put a lot of 
blood sweat and tears into building 
this program, and my goal is to see 
that vision through," Pierce said in the 
release.

The Truth about Diets 

Leading You to an Active Healthy Living 

By Joshua Collins 
Fitness Calumnist 



There are many diet fads out there 
and so many people are trying new 
ones in order lo lose weight. Now 
don't get me wrong, some actually 
do work, but there are a number of 
problems with these diets. 

First off, many of them tend to 
eliminate essential nutrients from 
your diet, like the "no carb diet." Carbs 
are where a lot of your energy comes 
from and wthoui carbs you tend to 
feel less motivated and deprive your 
body from lasting energy. 

Your body needs carbs for energy. 
There are two tj^pes of carbs, simple 
and complex. Simple carbohydrates 
are quick energy sources, but they 
do not usually supply any other 
nutrients or fiber. Examples would be 
fruit, fruit juice or sweets. Complex 
carbohydrates often supply energy 
and other nutrients and fiber that 
the body needs, such as bagel, 
pasta, cereal and nuts. Carbs when 
consumed in mass quantities what 
causes people to gain weight because 
they are high in sugars and when not 
used up get stored as fat. 

Secondly, diets won't help you keep 
the weight off. As soon as you go off 
the diet, you will gain the weight back 
plus more. This is because people get 
satisfied with the weight loss then 
go back to eating the foods they did 
before they lost the weight. 

Lastly, the best "diet" to use is not 
one at all. I'm sure you've heard 
the saying "everything is good in 
moderation" well that is for the most 
part true, it's all about portion control. 
Now it's very important for you to get 
the proper serving suggestions from 
the food guide pyramid per day, but 
in doing so the best thing to do is to 
break up the foods into five-seven 
portioned snacks per day. It's best to 
keep snacking all day long than it is 
to eat your t^'pical three meals. What 
this does is keep your metabolism 
going throughout the day, breaking 
down food quickly for energy. When 
you eat a big meal, it takes all your 
energy to break down the food, and 
whatever doesn't get broken down 
and used for energy, gets stored as 
fat. The statement 1 get from clients 
is. "I'm only eating one meal a day 
andl'mnot losing weight!" This is the 
complete opposite of what you need 
to do. Wlien you only eat once or twice 
a day, your body automatically goes 
into "starvation mode" and stores 
any food you lake in right away. Your 
body does this automatically because 
il doesn't know when it's going to get 
fed next, so it stocks up in case that 
was its last meal. 

Some examples of portion control 
would be instead of eating that whole 




Born and raised in Ontario, 
Canada, Joshua Collins 
graduated from IPFW in spring 
of 2008 where he majored in 
General Studies and minored 
in Psychology. While at IPFW. 
he played volleyball and made 
two Final Four appearances, 
capturing a 2nd place finish at 
the 2007 NCAA championships. 
He was certified through 
the International Sports &amp; 
Sciences Association (ISSA) 
in the summer of 2007 and is 
currently the head Personal 
Trainer at American Fitness 
here in Fort Wayne. His focus 
is on circuit training and 
specializes in running "boot 
camp" style workouts. Read 
more on boot camps in articles 
to follow. He is able to design 
workout programs, and diet 
plans specifically for any 
rndividual. He can train anyone 
to reach their personal goals 
whether it is to lose weight, 
gain muscle mass and strength 
or tone up. 

foot long sub for lunch, eat half then 
eat the other half two hours later. Cut 
your meals in half and try lo eat every 
couple of hours. This will keep your 
metabolism going throughout the 
day and thus keeping your digestive 
system breaking down food to be 
used right away and nol stored as fat. 
When this is done along with regular 
exercise four lo five times per week, 
then weight Joss is inevitable. 

So in the end, diets are not the best 
way to lose weight. It is better lo 
portion control your meals lo five to 
seven snacks per day and add regular 
physical exercise three to five times 
per week. You will notice the weight 
start to melt away.

Penalty kick gives IPFW tie in National Soccer Festival 



By Dan Vance 

The National Soccer Fesiival. (he country's pretniere 
pre-season college soccer event, was back in Fori 
Wayne last weekend and as usual, IPFW started their 
season in (he event. This year, they did so in a 1-1 tie 
with the Drake Bulldogs, 

Drake look 13 shots, but landed their only good 
shot on goal in the 55ih minute when midfielder 
Ryan Moylan knocked a ball by IPFW keeper Michael 
Knitter. Otherwise, the Mastodon defense kepi Drake 
off balance. Drake did the same in return, allowio); 
just six shots. Only two of those shots were on goal. 

One defensive mistake cost Drake the exhibition 
win as a foul was called on the Bulldogs inside the 
goalkeeper's box in the 78th minute. The foul allowed 
sophomore Rapheal Martinez to score on a penalty 
kick for the Mastodons to earn (he tie. Kevin Crombie, 
Jorge Ramierez. Marcel Garcia and Aaron Tblloch 
also took shots for IPFW. 

Knitter, a senior, stopped four shots in logging all 
90 minutes in goal for the Mastodons. Knitter's ftill 
game is an indication that head coach Mike Harper 
is committed to Knitter as the goaltender for now. 
The team is deep at the position with Knitter, fellow 
senior losh Howeli and lieshman Eric Fluck. The 
team has another freshman goaltender that will be 
redshirtling. 

The team has ten total h^eshmen this season, three

The crowning achievement for Ball also comes as a defining moment for a 
program that is farand away the posterchild for IPFW's athletic department. Ball 
has had his personal touch on five of the greatest moments in IPFW volleyball 
history now, lopping the list with this historic gold. But what else makes the cut? 

10. When then IPFW Athledc Director Mark Pope announced in the spring of 
2005 that the department would name the inaugural class to the newly created 
Hall of Fame in the fall, both coach Arnie and son Lloy were more than shoe-ins. 
On November 19, both legends took their place among IPFW's all-time greats. 
During the induction, Uoy was noted as "simply the most decorated athlete in 
the history of IPFW sports. ' 

9. Before he was the captain and the emotional leader for team USA volleyball. 
Ball was just another young kid living his dream. After graduating from IPFW in 
1994, he helped the United States to a sLver medal in the 1995 Pan-American 
games on the strength of 15 kills and five service aces. A year later, he found 
himself on the greatest stage of Ihem all for the first time as the starting setter for 
America during the 1996 Adanta OI&gt;Tnpics. 

8. In 2005, Arnie Ball won match 400 and became college volleyball's fourth 
winningest coach and cementing his top-notch status on the nadonal level. 

7. Eleven years after Jay Golsteyn ended his IPFW career with the most kills all- 
dme with 1,939, Hector Soto overpowered him atop the list. Considered to hitting 
what Lloy Ball is considered to setting in the annuls of IPFW history. Soto still 
holds steady atop the all-time kill hst with 2.193. 

6. When you start out with a four match-losing streak, it is hard to stay positive 
aboutyourseason.The200G team did just that and turned it into a school record 
16-match winning streak. 

5. By far the most significant coaching award ever given to IPFW, the American 
Volleyball Coaches Association recognized Arnie Ball in 2007 with their National 
Coach of die Year honor. He became the fifth non-West Coast coach to win the 
award since the AVCA first gave it in 1991. 

4. He had been recognized nationally in previous years, but 1994 was the year 
Uoy Ball broke out as the first ever l^-Team All-American for the Mastodons. 
IPFW has had many moreAll-Americanssincedien, but only two men have gone 
on to be named to the first team. 

3. Getting back to the Final Four in 2007 was not easy, but still predicted. What 
they did when they got there was nothing short of amazing as they upset number- 
one tanked Pepperdine to reach their first National Tide Game. In a sport 
dominated by teams from the Mountain Pacific Sports Fedetadon (in Lehman's 
terms: West Coast teams). IPFW of 2007 was just the seventh non-West Coast 
team to reach the Finals. 

2. In 1991, tournament MVP Fred Malcolm helped IPFW knock off Wisconsin- 
Milwaukee 3-0 and Ball Slate 3-2 to advance to their first NCAA Final Four. It was 
their first MIVA Tournament win. 

1 . "I've been waiting 14 years for this game." 

Lloy Ball's words said it all as he cashed in on an Olympic gold last Sunday in 
one of the final events in Beijing. 

"I think it was a maturation in me as a player, as well as a person. I was playing 
overseas and growing as a setter." 

Representing his family, his country and his home; Uoy Ball also represented 
IPFW, bringing their magnificent program fiill circle and ready for another go- 
round. He fought through the tough times and came out as a hero to many by 
earning the lop moment for this school in its athletic history.

A 1994 graduate. Ball had retired from the national team after the 2QD4 Ath- 
ens games, frustrated at the struggles to win a medal. He changed his mind 
and McCutcheon took a risk by re-adding the former Olympic captain in 2007 
before the Beijing games. It turned out to be the right decision for Ball, Mc- 
Cutcheon and the United States. 

"I came back. I got what I wanted. This time as I bow out my third time it will 
be more gracefiilly and without a return, " Ball said. 

Ball was just the third Fort Wayne native ever to win Olympic gold. He is the 
first to do so outside of a swimming pool and his team had to overcome a lot 
to accomplish the feat. 

If the landscape of the 2008 Olympics was a grass field, the morning dew 
had not yet even setded when die world was shocked by the stabbing deadi of 
the father-in-law of McCutcheon. The attack, deemed random, also severely 
injured his mother-in-law and it left an unenviable haze over a team that had 
established so much momentum in the time leading up to the games. In the 
wake of the tragedy, the team chose to compete, edging Venezuela 3-2 in the 
first game of pool play. They played several matches without McCutcheon. 

"The guys blocked it out as much as possible, but this win for him hope- 
fully puts a positive light on a horrific situation for everyone and his family. 
It would have been the worst thing possible for us not to give our best effort 
under those circumstances, " Ball said. 

The team won a World League Title at the end of July signifying that they 
may be the team to beat. And even through the struggles of several five-game 
matches, the United States did not falter. Domination in pool play sent them 
to the Quarterfinals where they toppled Serbia in one of those 3-2 victories. In 
the Semi-Final round, the Americans saw a 2-0 lead eliminated by the feisty 
Russians before pulling out a 15-13 game five ivin. That set up a gold medal 
meeting with Brazil. 

"I don't think any one instance immediately set us on diis path. It was a pro- 
gression of many events and days behind closed doors and all the work we put 
in that no one else saw except team and staff," said team captain Tom Hoff 
during a post-gold medal match press conference. 

After falling down in the first game, the United States showed resilience and 
picked off Brazil in the following three. The long, tumultuous road culminated 
with a Clay Stanley spike. Fitting as Stanley, the Hawaii graduate, had led the 
team offensively through much of the games. 

Most of the team is not expected to make returns for the 201 2 Olympics. The 
average age of a player from this team was just over 30, considered very old in 
volleyball circles. Uoy Ball, die eldest, is 36. 

The final match was not broadcast live on the NBC family of networks, ft was 
however played in primelime Sunday night, allowing for a large audience to 
watch the team win the allusive gold. 

For the younger Ball, it was all worth it in the end and he thanks his coach for 
his one last shot at glory. 

"Il was a huge risk for Hugh to bring me back to this team. If we didn't medal, 
it would be easy to say 'Why did you bring Uoy back. It didn't do it before.' I 
have thank Hugh for giving me that chance,' an emodonal Ball said. 

The school and the program will look to strike gold again in 2012. Former 
Mastodons Matt Zbyszewski and C.J. Macias are preparing to make attempts 
at qualifying for the London games. Zbyszewski as pan of Canada's beach vol- 
leyball team and Macias, the United States indoor team.
