Even a casual glance at U.S. labor

Despite these changes, however, 
work today for the vast majority ol 
women serves lo confirm their 
aubordlnnlion and dependence In a 
world In which the predominant values 
remain firmly masculine, 

American women Tirsl began lo work

Domestic Herviints, however,

although reliable early employment 
stalisUes for women are rare. By IBSO 
domestic service employed 1.2 mlUlan 
women.and faclory work. 1.0 milllan. 

All other major occupations tagged 
far behind: in 1890 there were only 
about 250,000 women teachers, 100,000 
in retail sales, and a mere TS,00O ofHce 
workers. Blue-collar work dearly

Who were these blue-collar working 
women ol the turn of Ibe century? 
Almost all were young, single im- 
migrant women supporting them- 
selves, or daughters ot immigrants 
helping to support their families. Only 
about one in eight working women was 
married. Even among Immigrant 
women, few expected lo continue 
working after marriage.

vice-chancellor for rmanclal affairs, 
who said last week that IPFW is seemg 
the very worst ol its parking problems 
right now. 

Carnaghi said he thinks the parking

sludents coming to the campus for 
reasons other than for classes, such as 
buying books or visiting counselore.

Currently. Shady said, his officers do 
not patrol that lot because students 
aren't using the lot For instance, he 
said, "The only Iwo cars that have

Shady also warned that workers at

borders the east sideof tho campus, are 
upset about ve hi el is belonging to

Shady said the large numbers ol 
vehicles on the campus has alio 
resulted in trairic Jarns during the pe«k 
noon-timeand evening hours. 

Although campus police olflcen 
direct traffic during these peak hours at 
the Inlenectlon of the campis' south

can do little lo speed up the traffic 
becaise the otticers have no control

Disabled gain mobility

Wheelchair-bound students and 
students on crutches hove few 
problems with mobility on the IPFW 
campus, said Debbie Grimm, 
counselor tor disabled students. 

Until recently, this was not true. 

Doors ihal opened In only one 
direction and entrances blocked by 
stairs wiire two of the major 
barriers lo mobility at IPFW that 
students in wheelchairs had to 
overcomeas recently as 1?79. 

Since Ihen, many of these oti- 
stacles have been eliminated. 
Grimm said. For instance, the doors 
connecting the wings ol Kettler Hall 
to Its mam hallways have been 
removed, making the w1n^ more 
accessible to the handicapped. Also, 
automatic doors hav-c been Installed 
In all the campus buildmgs so that 
students In wheelchairs can avoid 
the entrances wlOi steps. 

According to Grimm, the Han- 
dicapped Student Commlllee, made 
up of students with tfiverse 
disabllltiea, reviewed Itx plans for 
Building D and the athletic buildiDg

of the sidewalks that were cracked 
and uneven thai posed hazards to

wheelchairs.

Student Senate 
lacks legitimacy 



On Scpl 2. Ihe IPFW Sludtnl Stnali 
voted lUcIf inlo offiL-e over the cil&gt; 
Jecllons of its parllamenlarian and in 
viobljon of its conslilullon 

While many mcmbcra of Ihe Senate 
seem to believe (his is a trivial matter 
and hardly worlh Iheir own or the 
sludcnl body's concern, The Com- 
munlcalor believes difrcrcnily. 

If Ihis university is considered as a 
community, then ihe Sludcnl Senate is 
Ihe govcrnmen! of Ihis community, and 
lis actions and decisions arc the com- 
munity's body of law. 

Within the body of law, the constitution 
represents the ultimalc law. that against 
which all other taws are measured. 

ir the Senate circumvents Its con- 
stilulion, then it is setting itself above 
the law — a direct violation of all 
democratic process. 

The differences of opinions over the 
necessity of a special election Is 
shrugged off by many In the Senate os 
"a disagreement in interpretation." and 
therefore somehow mysterious and 
unsolvablc. It is. as Ken Schenk, student 
body president, put it. "a black hole." 
Some things in Ihis debate, however. 
are not a mailer of Inlcrprelalion. no 
matter what some senators would like us 
to believe. All committees, govern- 
mental or social, must have a quorum to 
conduct any business. This is so that the 
majority's will may be done and the 
minurity may be heard 

Returning to Webster, a quorum is 
defined as "the number (usually a 
majority) of officers or members of a 
body that when duly assembled is legally 
campctcnl to transact business." Before 
proceeding, the word "usually" in this 
definition should be explained. 

If a body at some point decides that a 
number other than a majority may 
conduct business, (hat body must enter 
this number in the minutes of the 
meeting with the full consent of its 
parliamentarian. AFTER that time, this 
other number may make decisions. 

This was not the case last summer 
when the petitioners were approved. 
Only now that questions have been 
raised does the Senate look back and 
say. In effect, "Oh, well. We'll call that 
other group a quorum." 

Many scnolore say they feel a special 
election would be too inconvenient, lake 
loo much lime, and possibly break up 
what they perceive to be a very good 
Senole, 

The luxury of convenience does not 
override the responsibility of due 
process of law. Anv senator who doesn't

past four years 



"Animal House," released 
In ISTB, was [unny In spots, 
but II lacked a good script 
and had no cohesion. II was 
simply a series of sketches 
about college life strung 
together, with no depth or 
chiracleriiatlon at all. No 
movie mogul expected much 
from the film. They were 
wrong. It had the right 
demographics, hit the right 
market, and went on to 
become the largest grossing 
comedy In nlm history, 
mahlngoverJM million. 

Unlortunalcly. il started a 

Film in the "Animal 
House" school, like "Cad- 
dyshack." "The Hollywood 
Knights," "Meatballs" and 
"Slripcs," appeared in rapid 
succession, and most of 
llicsc films had the same 
Faults. 

Tlie common denominator 
is their silcom tone and the 
level oF acling There is no 
oF fun Id these Films 



ditloncd by telniston lo 
think these bad sitcoms arc 
Funny People laugh at things 
not because they think they 
are Funny, but because they 
think they are supposed (o 
laugh 

This TV. mentfllily has 
slipped over Into the way 
people view films. Why else 
would people , chortle with 
laughter at the caveman 
scenes In "History oF the 
World. Pari I," or double 

"Caddyshack" where Bill 
Murray meets Cheiy Chase 
inhisaparlment? 

Humor is 5ub&gt;cclive, and 
what may be sophisticated 
and Funny to one person, 
may not be to someone else 
If nims like "Coddyshack" 
and "Cannonball Run" are 
sophisticated and Funny, 
then wit is In an oxygen tank 
somewhere dying. 

The upshot is this. We have 
a whole generation who 



down in his dclighlFully mad 
performance In "Bringing 
Up Baby," or seeing the 
Tracy Hepburn chemistry in 
"Adams Bib" or "Pal and 
Mike." Except tor Woody 
Allen, there Is no filmmaker 
today who IS making 
comedies with wil and style 
to match these films. 

However, Iherc Is hope. 
The only comedy released 
Ihis summer Uiat even ap- 
proaches the wil of the films 
of the 30i and 40s. "Arthur,"

Another sign of en-

"'We have a tremendous 
oullook We have runners 
who wilt surprise a lol of 
people this year. They're 
experienced, and they're

According lo Endsley. the 
strength of Ihe team comes 
not only from their talent, 
but from their togetherness.

Carlos Rojus followed his teammale to the showers, as he 
was followed by Branko Waric, who was followed by Leo

Stefankiewicz cleared his bench with little more than thirty 
mlnules lefl in the game. The Lakera, olready ploying w-'.!. 
only six players plus their goalie, put Brian Gaskey, a one- 
legged player, into Ihe nets. 

The Tuskers Ihen seemed to get over-aniious, as they 
were continually called for being offsides as they tried to 
penetrate a seemingly revitalized Laker defense However, 
when the Tuskers did manage lo get around the sticky 
defense, Gaskey came up wilh some brilliant saves on point- 
blank shots. Thai was unlil Slefoski found the range al the28
