IPFW presents romantic holiday musical

from Dec. 6 th'rough 

Williams TTieatft. 

This com an lie. musical 
romp through the seasons of 
love was the basis for the films 
"The Utile Shop Around the 
Comer" and "In the Good Old 
Summertime" starring Judy 
Garland. Two co-workers at the

romances, with each of them 
writing secret letters to a "Dear 

The seasons change, along

both in person and by post. 
Beautiful holidays are m sIoie 
when everyone's hearlfell desire 
is Hrully revealed. 

According to the director 
Craig A. Humphrey, "She Loves 
Me' is a beautifully structured. 
cKirmingly romantic exploration 
of character. It's a musical about 
real people tvilh real desire, real 
quirks and real fears, all told 
with great simplicity and love 



"She Loves Me" is not just 
the story of the relationship 
between Ceorg and Amalia. 
Rather, it is the story of all seven 
people that make up Maraczck's 
Parfumcrie in 1930s Budapest. 
Jerry Bock, Sheldon Hamick and 
loe Masteroff created a show 
whose music, lyrics and book 
are so perfectly integrated that 
every moment is either an 
expression of ils characters or an 
advancement of its plot." 

IPFW's production of "She 
Loves Me" features Melissa 
Dowly as Amalia and Jake 
Stackhouse as Georg Nowak.

Study finds poor student-faculty relationships 



BLOOMIN'CTON. Ind. — A 
national study of how college 
students view their educational 
experience shows considerable 

of student-faculty relationships. 

The 2002 report from the 
National Survey of Student 
Engagement (NSSE) says 62 per- 
cent of first'ycar sludents and 47 
percent of seniors have never 
worked with faculty members 
on activities other Ih^in coursework. 
And 41 percent of first-year 
students and 26 percent of scniois 
have never discussed ideas from 
their reading or classes with faculty 
members outside of Ihe classroom. 

NSSE Director George Kuh, 
chancellor's professor in the 
Indiana University School of 
Education and director of the 
Cenler for Postsecondary 



Research and Planning at lU. 
said these findings reflect a need 
for colleges and universities to 
find ways of Improving these 
percentages, "li's gratifying to 
see the positive change between 
first-year students and seniors, 
but there remains substantial 
room for improvemcnl," Kuh 

The NSSE report, tilled 
"From Promise lo Progress: Hoiv 
Colleges and Universilies Are 
Using Student Engagement 
Results to Improve Collegiate 
Quality," is based on information 
from 135,000 first-year and senior 
students at 613 four-year 
colleges and universities. The 
NSSE Web site is at 
http://mvw.indiana«lu/-nsse. 

Kuh said student engagement 
deals with how involved a 



sludenl becomes in his or her 
coUegeexpcncnce. "Many studies, 
show that cngaacmcnt is n* 
strong predictor 01 how well a 
student Icanu," he explained. 
"The more engaged students arc 
in college, the more likely they 
are to develop habits that lead to 
success later in life." 

The NSSE rcport. now in Ils 
third year, is co-sponsored by the 
Carnegie Foundation lor thp 
Advancement of Teaching and 
Ihe Pew Forum on Undergraduate 
Learning. NSSE is supported by 
grants lo Indiana University 
from Lumina Foundation for 
Education and the PeW 
Charilablc Trusts. ;

over lo the old Field s store, we 



We heard a man yelling 
' words I couldn't quite make oul 
through a blow horn (we were 
mon.' KNrused on staying together). 
I wasn't loo worried because less 
than an hour before some man 
was babbling aboul Christ while 
young girls threw papers at 
passcrsby regarding Ihe flaws in 



Christianity, 

1 had reason to worry. This 
time it was a band of about 60 
lur protesters shouting and hold- 
ing up Rrolcs&lt;iue signs with pic- 
tures ofslain animals. Not only 
did Ihey pick the greatest loca- 
tion in Chicago where 
thousands of people visit to see 
the Christinas displays, but il 
was the dai^ alter Thanksgiving, 
one of the biggest shopping days 
of Ihe vear. 

Needless lo say, we gol 
caught in quite a mess of people. 
While we pushed through the 
crowds (which were gelling 
angrier by the minute) my mother, 
like a two-year-old attracted to a 
shmy objecl, wandered right into 
the long stream of proleslers 
who were making tneir way 
right up to Slate Street. I had to 
literally shove people out of my 
way so I could pull her back near 
my Father and me. 

Once 1 gabbed my mother 



lost the race. The band of protesters 
had already beaten us to Ihe 
other block. So, here we went 
again. 

Now the crowd was much 
larger than before and gelling 
pretty steamed (one should note 
that many women in Chicago 
wear fur coats because Ihey are 
warm and fashionable). The men 
were, of course, being male and

As we quickly jaywalked 
across the street in order to get 
aivay from the croivds, I counted 
five more protesters who were 
wearing leather coats. By the 
lime Ihe protesters made it to the 
comer o( the street, the police 
were there, batons in hand, 
ready to lead them up to 
Michigan Avenue where many 
of the Dig (uf stores arc located. 
What IS my point in all oF 
Ihis? Well, first (which is very 
impoilanlto all fuhi re protesters), 
do not carry around anything 
Ihal may potentially link you to 



whatever il is that you're 
prolesling against. For example, 
iF I were going lo protest against

1 justify it this way - 
everything is born to die. We 
cannot control Ihe manner in 
which we die. except in cases of 
suicide, which i don'l believe in. 
The same principles apply lo

Is chivalry dead? 

^ the quote ''Chivalry is dead'' really true? Has our country become a door- 
slamming, female-grabbing society where the word "courtesy" is not 
' noivn? One ivriter says yes, one writer says no. 



Dead in the water 



If anyone is somewha 
unsure as lo what Ihe exact 
meaning oF chivalry is. 
Me rtiam- Webster's Dictionary 
can be a little helpful. 
According lo this particular 
source, chivalry, or chivalrous 
behavior, can be deFined as 
"marked by honor, courtesy, 
and generosil)'," Bul wait, it 
gels bctlcr. The delinition goes 
on to add "marked by especial 
courtesy to women." 

Last Saturday night. 1 
could just Feel that especial 
courtesy flowing Ihrough Ihe 
crowds of one ol Fort Wayne's 

Still hangin' on 






Fine nighttime hot spots. I The word itself sounds 

could especially feel il as Ihe old-fashioned. No wonder people 

kind gentlemen 1 ran into not 

only forgave me for stepping 

on his foot, but then gave me a 

nice little pal on Ihe behind 

I'm sure he was just trying to 

reassure me Ihal there were no 

hard fee lings - 

When I think of chivalry, 
I think of a tall and handsome 
man (definitely tall and hand- 
some.. .and goes by the name 
ol Darcy), and I picture him 
standing before me. clad in a 
long coal, a tall hat and some 
really tight panis, holding Ihe 
door open for me to enter a 
restaurant. Oh, and his horse 
is tied up out front. 



Whoever said Ihal chivalry 

IS dead is dead tvrong. I can 
honestly say that 1 enjoy chivalry 
and wish il would show up in 
more men around this area, I'm 
from the South, a place where 
chivalry is very much alive and 
practiced on a regular basis.

enough, held Ihe door for me- 
lt wasn't the usual walk 
through the door and then 
hold it open jusl long enough 
for you to jab your fool in the 
door frame before il closes. 

Instead, he opened the

Ephedra: Danger in diet pills? 



By Angela Bauer, R.N. 
Giifsl Wi-itiv 

The image thai "thin is in" 

oasis, and for some, the pressure 
is so entremc Ihal Ihey arc 
unhappy, depressed and damage 
their bodies. Tliey look lo sup- 
plements as one way to fight fal, 

Ihcse supplemcnis know the 
polcniial risks they take? 

Ephedra, an appetite 
suppressant and energy booster, 
is used by millions of people. The 
most frequent consumers of 
ephedra products are females 
aged 18-15. 

Hydroxycul, a popular diet 
pill currently on the market, con- 
tains ephedra, also known as ma 
huang. Olhcr popular pills or 
drinks containing ephedra are 
Ripped Fuel and Shape-Fast 
Plus. Consumers can obtain 
ephedra from health food stores 



Ephedra is oil en combined 
with caffeine, causing serious 
side effects in those who 
consume more Ihan the recom- 
mended daily dose. 

include hi^h blood pressure, pal- 
pilalions, incicascd heart rate, 
Strokes, seizures, depression and 



an-iely. When caffeine is addL'd 
to ephedra or one of its derivatives, 
the potential risk for cardiovas- 
cular complications increases as 
do the risks for strokes and 

Several research studies 
have Ijeon done, some making 
claimsaboutlhesafety.ind efficacy 
of the ephedra products and 
others showing only harmful 

One hazard that involves 
ephedra is its cons islenlly inconccl 
labeling. A study reported in the 
American Journal of Heallh- 
System Pharmacy looked al 
labels lo determine if Ihey 
correctly correlated with the 
actual content of the supplement. 
As the report points oul, mosI 
people are unaware that the 
Food and Drug Administration 
does no! regulate dietary 
supplemenL^^. The study found 
that more often than not, the 
labels were incorrecl in giving 
the actual dosage of the product. 

ephedra is up to three times a 
day, each of which contains 20 
milligrams. If the label is incor- 
rect, how much is one actually 
consummg daily? Too much? 
Not enough? 

On the other band, there 
have been several studies thai 



have proven the safely of. the 
ephedra supplement. 

One such sludy. published 
in lhe Intemational Journal oF 
Obesity, found that ephedra 
combined wilh caifeine,aiel and 
exercise, resulted in a significant 
reduction in weight and body fat. 
The researchers also discovered 
thai choleslcrol and glucose Ici'els 
decreased over lhe six-month 

There was, however, a slight 
increase in heart rale and blood 
pressure among subjects and 
reports of dry moulh, heartburn 



Subjects showed minimal side 
effects that are often associated 
with lhe caffeine and ephedra 
products, and no adverse effects. 
Diet pills and supplements 
are everywhere. Ephedra is a 
very controversial supplement 
currently on the market, templing 
people with potential weight 
loss. There are advantages and 
disadvantages to any drug, as 
there arc wilh ephedra, so it is up 
lo each individual to decide if 
Ihis product is righl lor him. As a 
consumer, one can easily discover 
whelher he is potentially harm- 
ing his body wilh the use ol diet 
supplements through research 
on the Internet or from speaking 
with a health care professional.

In fall 2001 a very special 
album was recorded. This 
album took to new heights the 
vision that some people have ol 
traditional folk music in 
America, as well as demonstrat- 
ed what punk musicians are 
capable ol creating. 

The album is "A Melody of 
Retreads of Broken Quills" by 
the Filthy Thieving Bastards. 
and it should be seen 05 a pinrude 
musical achie^'cment of the new 
century. However, since it was 
re^p'ded last year, and slill no 
one seems lo be familiar with 
lhe album, this mther lale 
review is being whiten in lhe 
hope that it will expose many 
more people to this masterpiece. 

In order to understand 
more about "A Melody of 
Retreads and Broken Quills" a 
history of the Filthy Thieving 
Bastards should be given. 

The band started as a side 
project to San Francisco's home- 
town and Fal Wreck Chords 
heroes the Swingin' Ullers 
when vocalist Johnny Bonnel 
and guitarist Darius Koski 
decided to create music that was 
indicative of the folk and 
Iry music that ihey grew up to 
and enjoyed. 

The Swingm' Utters are 
wcll-kr\own for incorporating 
tradilional instruments in punk 
songs, but Ihey never really had 
a Swingm' Utters acouslic 
album, or had more than one 
track per Swingin' Utters album 
that was comptclely acouslic. 

Alter deciding to go ahead 
wilh the creation of a complete- 
ly different band, the duo 
recruited guitarist Greg Lisher 
of Camper Van Beethoven lo 
help create this punkier folk 
music that they had envisioned 
all along. 

The Filthy Thieving 
Bastards relea.i^ed lhe "Our 
Fathers SenI Us" EP arid it was 
received well by critics. Bonnel, 
always noted for his lyrical

ability to create lir, 
of lost loves, soldi! 
home from war and depression 
brought on by drinking-subjccls 
that Bonnet seems to know 
nothing about, but was still able 
lo wrile about with exquisite 
grace. 

Alter lhe success of the EP 
It became apparent that a full- 
length album had lo be recorded. 
What was recorded is one of the 
most underrated works of musi- 
cal genius. II was the album "A 
Melody of Retreads and Broken 
Quills," 

The album begins wilh an 
almost honky lonk-like song 
"Death is not the End." not the 
Bob Dylan song, but a complete- 
ly original song Ihat from lhe 
sound that Koski gave il, is pay- 
ing homage to Irish greats lhe 
Pogues. a band that has 
influenced them both greatly 

Other nolablc tracks on lhe 
album are "Gene and lean." a 



beautiful look at lile through a 
somewhat dyslunclional cou- 
itchy and 
enthralling "Trolley Sum's" 
which has an almost Beatles' 
"Hello. Goodbye" song ending. 

"The Killmg Kino" is cer- 
tainly a standout track, with all 
lhe frustration Ihat Bonnel put 
into the lyrics of the Swingin' 
Utters and beauliful music Uia( 
Koski wrole lor this album. 

Even though the album 
ends wilh "An Olhenvisc 



ick, "Abcrfan," wrlllcn about 
a deadly mudslide Ihat killed 80 
school children. 

Tlus album should be rec- 
ognized for its brilliance, and it 
is a shame Ihal il has not been 
noticed, despite its rave

I Ihealrical production 
of -The Man Who Came to 
Dinner." of course? 

Written by Mo$s Hart and 
George Kaufman, Ihis three acl 
play shows us a small slice of the 
life of 1930s radio petsonalily, 
lecturer and aullior Sheridan 
IVhiicside as he is stranded in 
llie small town of Mesalia, Ohio. 
Whiteside is suffering from a 
fractured hip obtained l^slipping 
on a piece of ice on the doonlop 
of the Stanley's, a wealthy but 
sheltered family. 

He disrupts their lives by 
his mcreprescnoe. with celebrities 
coming in and out, and presents 
such as penguins and Egyptian 
mummy cases twins delivered 
by famous figures and prominent 
scientists. Because of his influence, 
the two teenage children of the 
family run away to puisue their 
own wishes, much to the dismay 
ol Mr. and Mrs. Stanley. 

When asked if ^e show has a 
deeper meaning, director Haj\'ey 
G Cocks has this to add, "Moss 
Hart ivas asked once what the 
show was aljoul. He said thai it 



really about the power ol 
'Icbrity, what influence il has 
1 people, what honors they get 
because of it and what damage

olher people.

personality not-so-loosely based 
on the mutual friend ol Moss 
and Hart's, Alc)iandcr Wollcoll. 

Murphy, a long-time theatre 
veteran of Fort Wayne, is keeping 
busy Not only is he playing a 
character who is cocutantly 
onstage except for a collective 14 
pages, but he is also directing a 
children's production of 'The 
Besi Christmas Pageant Ever" at 
the Fort Wa&gt;Tie Youlhealre. 

This role is a change. 
Murphy says. "I'm used lo play- 
ing second or third banana , and 
there are so many lines lo leam 
in this show. It is always a 
ctialtcoge." 

Pulf-Zakhi, Ihe leading lady, 
portrays Maggie Cutler, 
Whiteside's secretary. Puff- 
Zakhi IS able lo identify with 
Maggie. "Maggie is a lot like 
how [ see mysell being in 10 

humor, quick lo defy authority. 
She is a great character," Puff- 
Zakhi says, 

Strevm throughout Ihe play 
are parodies of Gertrude 
Lawrence, Noel Coward and 
even a cliaracler reminiscent of 
Harpo Marc Banjo, played by 
Jim Nelson, is only in one act, 
but during thai lime he quite 
possibly expends more energy 



togclher. He jumps olf solas and 
tangos with the cook as well as 
performing other crazy feats ot 
slapstick. "It lakes a lot of lime 
preparing for a performance." 
says, "1 do breathing 
— well as other physical 
warmups," 

This reporter cannol help but 
hold Ihis play in a certain 
regard. He is biased, as he is in 
Ihe piny itself. Keep on Ihe look-

the son of the family. He is an 
enlhusiaslic pholographer, and 
along wilh his sister June, mokes 
friends with Whiteside, who 
encourages him to pursue his 
photojoumalistic aspirations.

Student reponds to Ohio State fire celebration 



Many of you were in the 
same position as I was a couple 
of weekends ago — on the 
couch, watching Ihe Ohio Stale- 
Michigan game, Urdike some. I 
was disappointed that Ohio 
Stale won. 

Despite that misery, what 
disappointed me even more 
was coming home lo watch the 
II p.m. news and seeing the city 
ol Columbus in flames, 

1 got lo thinking, "Whal in 



people that drunk thai Ihey 
cannot control their excitement 
and have lo bum down building 
and practically kill each other? 

Il must have been a good 
weekend for beer sales all over 
college football land because 
Columbus w,is not the only 
victim of human stupidity. 

In Ctemson, the fans lore 
down the goalposts. At Cal, 
fans were lighting after Iheir 
victory over rival Stanford. At 
NC Stale, a brawl occurred alter 
the win over FSU, Why is all ol 
this violence occurring? One 
word — alcohol. 



Don't get me wrong, I 
enjoy a l&gt;eer at the game, but 
come on. When you gel to Itie 
point of destroying goalposts 
that cost as much as tuition at 
these schools. 1 think there is a

Study finds a rise in depression, bipolar

students facing new prcssu 
and life changes that can trigger 
wrious mood swings. In fact, 
researchers report a significant 
nse in stress and mental illnesses 
such as depression and bipolar 
disorder in young adults, as 
well as alarmingly high rales of 
suicide — now the second-leading 
cause ol death among college 
'■tudents. 

These (actors may be of 
particular concern during final 
evams — a time when students 
ine under mtense pressure to 
complete projects and ace 
evams before breaking for the 
holidays. The intense slrcss 
during Ihis period may 
exacerbate mood swings and, 
lor Ihe most vulnerable, even 
prompt suicidal thoughts. 
Students who have bipolar 
disorder may be most at risk. 

Why? Bipolar disorder 
(also known as manic depression), 
IS marked by cvlreme swings 
Irom high (manic) lo low 
(depressive) moods and often 
begins in the late teens to early 
Iwenties — a lime when many 
young adults are heading olf lo 
college and living aw.iy (fom 



home for the lust time. 

Further, Ihe stress thai 
results from academic pressures 
may trigger mood episodbs that 
can exacerbate bipoiardisorder. 

The reason? Some of Ihe 
lell-tale signs of bipolar disorder 
— particularly the depressive 
episodes — ollni are miajiagnosed 
tiecause some o( Ihe symptoms 
so closely mirror those of lypi- 
cal clinical depression (also 
called unipolar depression). 

II Icll misdiagnosed or 
undiagnosed, bipolar disorder 
can luve potentially devastating 
eflecis resulting in harmful 
behaviors such as drug and 
alcohol abuse and suicide 
attempts. 

In lact, the suicide rate lor 
those wilh bipolar disorder is 
three times higher Ihan in Ihe 

Sen era I population, with one in 
ve people with Ihe illness 
attempting suicide — most 
often during a depressive 

"Patients with bipolar 
disorder on average receive 
three misdiagnoses and consult 
three lo four mental health pro- 
fessionals over an eight to 10 
year period before learning the 
true cause of their illness," 
noted Dr. Joseph Goldberg, 
...: profe.'sor of Weill 



Medical College ol Cornell 
University, 

"Young adults who are 
under extreme slrcss and who 
have undiagnosed bipolar 
disorder may turn to drugs and 
alcohol lo alleviate their 
symptoms, which can put them 
at even greater risk of tiarmlul 
events such as suicide attempts. 
Given the pressures many 
students feel during final 
exams, it is important Ihat any 
young adult who is experiencing 
notable signs of changes in 
mood should seek professional 

Some ol the key signs and 
symptoms that mightbcextiibitcd 
by a person suffering from 
bipolar disorder include 
excessive energy; activity; 
restlessness; racing thoughts; 
rapid talking; sleep deprivation; 
irritability; persistent sad, anxious 
or empty moods; fatigue; 
feelings ol hopelessness and 
thoughts of death or suicide.

and we're starting against 
Minnesota," Paltetson said. 
"They're bigger, slroncer and 
(aster than we are. On the other 
hand, thai doesn't bother us a 
whole tot. We'll eo up there, and 
we'll play them hard. And if we 
can come back from Minnesota 



And that is eiaclly what the 
Mastodons came home from 
Minnesota wearing. After being 
tiandled by the Golden Gophers 
116-73, IPFW rebounded lo 
defeat Savannah Stale 96-16, 

However, Ihe SO-poml victory 
can only be considered a small 
step for Ihe Dons toward their 
season goal. IPFW managed jusl 
four viclories a year ago, and 
that is a number Patler^on 
would like to improve upon. 

"Our expectations are high, 
bul everything is relative to 
where you're starling Irom. We 
had a season last year thai was 
hard for all of us lo take," he 
said. "I'd say if we ivin 10 games 
or more, we'd be pretty happy 
this year. We're going to be 
young and inexperienced, bul 
we expect great things oul ol this 
team, just defining great right 
now would be double-figure 

ipFW's roster will include 
eight freshmen, meaning that 
Pallerson will be cxpecling some

"We're building a program." 



he said- "We don'l have a 
program yel, and you have to 
start someplace. We basically 
culled this learn from last year. 
We kepi four retunung players 
who are quality players that can 
help us. We're basically slartmg 

Teerea Dudley will be Ihe 
lone senior in Ihe line-up. Juniors 
Amy Cearlds and sophomores 
Courtney Niclcy and Verea 
Bibbs will be tne only olher 
returners for the Dons. 

"You can't talk about this 
learn without al least talking 
about Amy Gearlds. Amy is a 
legitimate player. She's a great 
outside shooter and a very 
compclitivc kid who wants to 
play hard. She's got a scorer's 
mentality, and that's important 
lo us." said Patlerson, "Our 
leadership out of Tecara Dudley 
will also be important lo us. and 
we enpecl Courtney Nicley and

IPFW hockey club cuts season short 

Lack of participation, fan support lead to decision 



Ducloa lack of players and 
fan support, Ihe IPFW hockey 
club has decided to cut its 

Adcr starting Ihc season 2-2, 

Ihe Dons skidded to mid-season, 

T^ie club had more than 20 



against Bowling C 
we t»ad eight sfeatei 



re concerned for the safety 
of the players." said coach Lyrm 
Vardaman.' "Our guys really gul ted 
out theses games and gave whal 
they had, but when you don't 
have the rest you need between 
shifts, vou wiO get extremely 
faligued and prone to injury." 

Normally, a hockey team 
can dress 19 skaters and two 
goalies, and the Dons were regu- 
larly outnumbered by nearly 10 
players. 

"We were behind the eight 
t&gt;all the whole season l)ecause of 
lack of players," Vardaman said. 
"We were expecting more players 
Irom last year's team, and we 
tiad a tol of mleresl in players 
trying oul for the team, but 



when It came down to Iry-ouLs 
we only had about 12-13 players " 
The club was able lo allraci 
a izvi extra participants during 
ils shortened season but not 
enough lo keep competing, 

"We had scheduled our full 
season last spring, so we tried lo 
carry on with the season," 
Vardaman said. "We picked up a 
player here and there, bul then 
we started losing players lo 
injury and frustration at not 
being compelitive because of 
lack of players." 

Another reason IPFW cut 
ils season shorl was the lack ol 
fan support at home games. The 
club enlered the season with a 
budget of S56,000, most of 
which was expected lo be covered 
by ticket sales. The anticipated 
budget was based on attendance 
al the Dons' two home games 
last season. 

Hockey is an enpensive 
sport with each home game 
costing approximately Sl.lSOO. 

"We had to pay 15 percent 
of our gate to McMillen Ice 
Arena, but if we had the fan bose 
we were expecting, we would 
tiave been okay with our budget," 
Vardaman said. 

Tlte carwxlla lion of Ihe season 
does not mean the end of IPFW 



hockey, though. The club plans 
lo have a meeting m the spring 
to determine how much inleresi 
there is among students. 

"If we have the players, we 
will mobilize for anotner season, 
but it won't be easy. After canceling 
games, teams wiU be reluctant to 
schedule with us," Vardaman 
said. "And the cost of operating 
a hockey club may be too great 
without university support. But 
we will see how much inleiesl 
there is and make our decision 
from there." 

Wilh the proposed addition 
of dorms lo the IPFW campus, 
Vardaman believes the future oi 
the club is bright. 

"Hockey is one of the best 
spectator sporls and could be a 
great sourceof campus life in the 
hiture. Wilh llu addition of campus 
housing, maybe we can start '" 






with

IPFW was fed by David

said. 'As Far as what I did. I was 
trying to gel my gu&gt;-s lo come 
out of Ihe paint to open up Ihe 
middle, and it worked at times. 
We got some slashes in there and 
got some good looks at the baskel. 
We played all right in the post." 

Playing his first game in the 
Coliseum motivaled bimon. 

"(Playing at Ihe Coliseum] 
was great. 1 really enjoyed il," 
Simon said. "It was a good

Three of the Mastodo
