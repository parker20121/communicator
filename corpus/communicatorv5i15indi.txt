$200,000 for the Indiana-Purdue Lib- 
rary's new book budget for the 1973-74 
school year. 

The library's funds for purchas- 
ing new books were frozen because 
the two administrations could not 
agree on how much should be 
allocated from the university's bud- 
gets. 

Last year the universities allocat- 
ed $117,000 for new book purchases. 
This year, however, prob lems arose 
in balancing budgets for both Purdue 
and Indiana and the library's funds 
were frozen. 

Out of the $200,000, only $50,000 
has actually been allocated from the 
universities' budgets; $100,000. which 
was prevkisly in the library's building 
project fund, has been transferred to 
the new book budget. The library has 
also received $50,000 from the 
Centennial Fund.

Chorba: IU-PU radio station 
in permanent limbo 



By MARK FRANKE 

A 50,000 watt non-commercial FM 
radio station broadcasting from the 
Indiana-Purdue campus? Although 
such a goal may seem difficult to 
accomplish, that is exactly what 
communication instructor Frank J. 
Chorba has in mind. 

Chorba has been research direc- 
tor for the project since September 
1972. He was given one-quarter 
released time during the 1972-73 
academic year to work on the project. 

The project, which was scheduled 
for completion last spring, has bogged 
down and appears to be at a standstill, 
according to Chorba. He described 
the state of the project as one of 
"permanent limbo." 

David A. McCants, chairman of 
the section of communication, said 
ithat the coming change in administra- 



gram while still functioning independ- 

"What is needed is someone with 
sufficient time to take hold of this 
project and make it work," said 
Manges, adding that this could best be 
accomplished through a not-for-profit 
corporation. 

Manges said that he "would go to 
bat for this project" if the corporation 
could assure him that it would provide 
the funds necessary to go on the air 
and operate for three years. 

The precedent for such a corpora- 
tion has been set by the Communica- 
tor, which is published by a 
not-for-profit corporation created by 
university-related people. 

The broadcasting corporation 



opeating expenses of the station 
through gifts and donations from 
various sources in the community, 
such as foundations, industrial cor- 
porations, and individuals. 

Chorba's research has taken him 
to ten cities in the general Fort Wayne 
area. Over 2,300 audience question- 
aires and 350 community opinion 
leader questionaires have been com- 
pleted to provide the necessary data 
for the HEW application. In this 
research Chorba was assisted by over 
70 IU-PU students and faculty 
members. 

The proposed station would serve 
a 75-mile radius from the campus, 
including 15 counties in northeast 



The award, which was sponsored 
by Alpha Phi Omega, was the 
culmination of a contest in which 
interested students and staff bought 
votes at a penny apiece to nominate 
their favorite (or possibly least 
favorite) professors for the reward. 

The money raised in the contest, 
over $150, will go to a fund for Beth 
Ann Phillips, a five year old who 
recently underwent open heart sur- 
gery.

because of the financial c 
. that the university will have to make 
to continue it. Roger J. Manges, dean 
and director of Purdue here, said that 
he did not want to obligate the 
university to a project that could cost 
approximately a quarter of a million 
dollars over the next three years. 

Because of his unwillingness to 
commit the super-chancellor to such 
an expensive project, Manges has 
assigned the radio station a low 
priority for the next three or four 
months. 

Chorba has been collecting data 
to use in applying for a grant from the 
U.S. Department of Health, Educa- 
tion and Welfare. If approved, the 
grant would pay up to 75 per cent of 
the start-up costs for the station. 

Even with the HEW money, the 
university will have to provide 
funding for aUleast 25 per cent of the 
estimated $80,000 start-up costs and 
the entire annual operating budget of 
$60.ooo-$80,000 for three years. 

Chorba would like to organize a 
foundation to raise money in the 
community, but his suggestion has 
not been approved by the campus 
administration. According to Mc- 
Cants, there is no plan for raising the 
university's share of the funding. 

Dean Manges suggested that a 
not-for-profit corporation be formed 
to apply for the broadcasting license 
and operate the station. This corpora- 
tion would be separate from the 
university, but would have some type 
of contract with IU-PU to operate on 
campus ana maKe itself available for 
campus use. 

The station could be used by the

Joint committee formed 
to find super-chancellor 



Indiana-Purdue moved a step 
farther in its unification process with 
the announcement Monday of a joint 
committee to searchfor a super-chan- 
cellor who would report to the 
presidents and boards of trustees of 
both universities. 

Presidents John W. Ryan of 
Indiana and Arthur G. Hansen of 
Purdue have asked a prominent Fort 
Wayne civic leader, Henry F. Rood of 



The new chancellor is expected to 
assume office on July 1, 1974, or as 
soon thereafter as possible. The 
presidents will urge the committee to 
complete its work in time for the 
chancellor-designate to participate in 
the reorganization of the campus and 
in the planning of next year's budget. 



The four Purdue faculty mem- 
bers on the committee were elected 
last week in a special election. They 
are: Dr. Richard E. Hill, associate 
supervision; Dr. H. 
i Davies, professor of biologi- 
cal sciences, Dr. Maynard J. Mans-

ST. JOHN'S JOURNAL 



Impeachment is power struggle 



By JEFFREY ST. JOHN 



Arnold for business manager 

There has been considerable speculation of late as to who will be 
appointed the new IU-PU business manager. The speculation has been 
prompted by two factors: the decision to name, if you will pardon the 
expression, a super-business manager; and the decision by Tom Scott to 
leave his post here for one in the East. 

The presidential agreement to name a single chancellor and business 
manager provoked speculation as to whether the super-chancellor would 
bring in his own business manager, or retain Scott in the expanded 
position. 

But the announcement of Scott's resignation has added a new twist to 
the rumors. Will there be an interim business manager appointed by 
Lafayette who will then naturally ascend to the new job? 

Rumors to that effect, and they have been circulated by what many 
newspapers refer to as highly credible sources, have become so 
widespread that they are worrisome. The most prominently mentioned 
candidate is Jim Thatcher, direelor of regional campus business affairs 
for Purdue. Thatcher becomes a more determined candidate since he lost 
out on the Lafayette business manager position. 

The prospect of a "Purdue" business manager is frightening to 
many, this paper included. Such a person could negate the independence 
IU-PU achieved through a single budget and subordinate business 
manager. 

With this in mind, we recommend that a truly interim business 
manager be appointed to function only until a permanent person can be 

Secondly, the permanent business manager should be familiar with 
this campus and both main campuses. He must not be sent up to this 
campus from Lafayette. 

There are a number of people on campus who could qualify, one of 
which we think would be an excellent choice. This person is Bill Arnold, 
director of financial aids. Arnold has worked with both university 
systems as financial aids director, and he is well aware of the strengths 
and shortcomings of both. He has been with IU-PU since its beginning. 

Arnold's logical, common sense approach to problems is what the 
IU-PU business office is going to need. He is the perfect candidate, which, 
we are sorry to say, probably disqualifies him from consideration,

This fierce defiance earned 
Johnson a unique place in this 
republic's history: the only president

Johnson is almot identical to the 
current attempts to remove Richard 
Nixon from office. However, it is not 
enough to charge the Democratic 
critics of the current administration 
with gross political motives for 
seeking impeachment. 

Only by seeing the current moves 
for impeachment of President Nixon 
in a larger historical perspective can 
we understand what is at stake for the 
United States. 

The parallels between the im- 
peachment of Andrew Johnson and 
the current altempts to impeach 
Richard Nixon are striking. The 
radical Republicans during the post- 
U.S. Civil War period justified 
impeachment in the name of curbing 
presidential power. The current 
congressional radical Democratic 
coalition is seeking Mr. Nixon's 
impeachment on the grounds the 
president is too powerful and the 
restoration of coequal status of Con- 
gress and the executive is imperative 
if our form of government is to 
survive. Left out of this argument is 
the fact that it has been the radical 
liberals of both parties who created a 
powerful presidency, which they now 
claim they wish to curb.

Republicans used to bring about the

Walking can be particularly 
important in conserving fuel since it 
takes the place of the short automo- 
bile trips which are the most 
gas-consuming. For example, the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) recently reported that its test

There are a number of considera- 
tions to keep in mind if you are 
contemplating a new car. First, 
remember that vehicle weight is the 
most important factor in fuel econ- 
omy. EPA has found that cars can be 
expected to lose between one and two 
percent in gasoline mileage for every 
100 pounds of weight increase. 

Also keep in mind that conveni- 
ence devices like air conditioners, 
automatic transmissions, power 
brakes, power sets, power windows 
and power steering all have a 
negative effect on gasoline mileage. 

Thirdly, streamlined design does 
make a difference in gasoline mileage 
since the more streamlined cars have 
less drag during highway driving. 

I want to conclude by saying how 
important I think it is that we each set 
good examples during this energy 
crisis. Many people will be watching 
their friends and neighbors to see if 
they are complying with the fuel 
conservation guidelines. Unless we 
each make a concerted effort to cut 
down on our fuel consumption, we will 
have to submit to more drastic 
controls and we may find ourselves

impeachment of Andrew Johnson 
concerned the dismissal of his 
secretary of war. just as Mr. Nixon's 
firing of special Watergate prosecutor 
Archibald Cox triggered the current 
impeachment effort of Mr. Nixon. The 
real intent of the radical Republicans 
in Johnson's time was to neutralize 
and isolate Lincoln's successor as 
part of a post-Civil War radical 
"reconstruction" plan, which John-

Critics of President Nixon's 
opposition to the attempts by Con- 
gress to railroad through new and 
more radical social programs or 
retain large parts of the (Lyndon) 
Johnson Great Society legislation 
have the same intent: restructuring 
the American political and social 
system. Like President Andrew 
Johnson, President Nixon has vetoed 
a procession of legislation that would 
benefit only minorities.

want to overturn the mandate Mr. 
Nixon received last year and remove 
the roadblocks put up by the 
administration against more radical 
social programs. The recent protect- 
ed battle over dissolving the Office of 
Economic Opportunity, created dur- 
ing the (Lyndon) Johnson era, is a 
case in point. In sum , the conflict we 
are witnessing over impeachment is a 
naked power struggle, cloaked by 
radical and liberal Democrats In 
therobes of moral righteousness. 

The consequences of impeach- 
ment of Richard Nixon cannot be 
clearly forecast. However, we do 
know what the consequences were for 
the country by the impeachment of 
Andrew Johnson. Foremost, it pre- 
vented a genuine and just post-Civil 
War reconciliation between North and 
South. 

The victims of this poisoning of 
the country's political process were

impeachment of Richard Nixon 
should be successfully carried off, it 
will imperil our liberties just as the 
impeachment of Andrew Johnson did. 
The political struggle we are witness-

enemies is made all the moe tragic 
because neither faction is concerned 
with human freedom, but only with

'No thinking' with U.S. TV 



By RICHARD SOKOLOWSKI 



The Media people invited for the 
tour of their facilities and programs 
three selected Europeans, a former

lack of evidence, a village idiot from 
France, and a retarded Englishman. 

"Well," said the Media speaker, 
after exposing his guests to an 
average American diet of 10 hours 



shot, 15 were 
strangled, 17 were kicked to death and 
the rest were chopped to pieces. It's 



muchissimo instructive. It makes me 
nostalgic. I want to go back and start 
working." 

"T.V. makes the economy run," 
philosophized the speaker. "And you, 
Monsieur, what is your opinion?" 

"Gee, your commercials are 
terrific," answered the village idiot. 
"But why do you put this other stuff in 
between. Pourquoi?" 

"That's life!" answered senten- 
ciously the speaker. "You can't 
always have TV and enjoy it too. But 
we keep trying."

It is time to go one step further 
and find out what actually has been 
the effect of a mastectomy on the 
emotional and social lives of women 
who underwent this operation. I 
propose a study of postmastectomy 
patients asking them to compare their 
sense ofemotional well-being before 
and after the operation. Data should 
also be collected on married women 
as to how many divorces, how many 
separations, how many "no change in 
married life." Of the single women, 
how many found husbands or boy- 
friends? 

It is only by knowing the complete 
truth that women with breast cancer 
can decide on a course of treatment 
with intelligence and accept the 
results with courage. 

Of those readers who have had 
mastectomies themselves, please 
write to this column about your 
postoperative adjustment. 




"I think you are perfectly right," 
answered the speakers. "Our viewers 
do not want to think, and we are to 
meet their needs. But other destruct- 
ive people want to have a different

They do not need to watch us." 

"Don't they put though when they 
buy almost everything?" wondered 
the village idiot. "I love sugar pops. 
Isn't T.V. advertisement included in 
the price?" 

"Sure," answered the speaker, 
"but they don't need to buy cereal. 
Let them grow their organic sugar 
pops. This is a free country."

Englishman. "Man, after that Eng-

stomach!" 

"Why, they can stop drinking 
beer, right?" said the speaker. "Let 
them drink water. It's healthier."

news," said the village idiot. "It 
makes me think. Couldn't you get rid 
of it?"

Doctor's Bag 

By ARNOLD WERNER. MD 

QUESTION : My wife and I disagree on whether or not there 
is a pill available by prescription which the man may take 
in lieu of the woman taking birth control pills. Says says 
there is and I say there isn't a birth control pill for the man. 



There are no oral contraceptives available for 
men at this time. There are active research programs to 
develop contraceptives for men that would interefere with 
sperm production or activity, and yet be reversible, which 
" i be taken by pill or injection. I do not believe any of 



Oral contraceptives are much easier to develop for 
women than for men since the female reproductive system 
functions in a much more defined and systematic fashion 



control of several discrete hormones and occurs in a 
cyclical fashion. Oral contraceptives establish a hormonal 
environment that does not permit the usual release of the 
egg, therefore fertilization and pregnancy cannot take 

In the man, sperm are produced fairly continually and 
are stored for release whenever ejaculation occurs. The 
hormonal conditions necessary for sperm production 
basically involves the presence of the masculinizing 
hormone, testosterone. Interference with this certainly 
stops sperm production but it also results in becoming 
feminized, decrease in sex drive, and changes in body 
appearance. 

While I continue to hope for the perfect contraceptive 
before my reproductive senescence, I am not optimistic. In 
the meantime, sperm being relatively puny things, they are 
rather easily stopped before they get loose. Therefore, if the 
Pill of IUD (intrauterine device) poses problems, there are 
still condoms, contraceptive foam and diaphrams. 

QUESTION: I am trying to persuade one of my roommates 
to use an underarm deoderant. She insists that it is 
unhealthy to do so. Are the effects cumulative? 

ANSWER: The odor associated with sweating is due to 
^bacterial action on perspiration. There are basically two 
;fjfpes of sweat glands, one is found all over the body and the 
Hither type is found under the arms, in the genital region and 
•around the nipples. The second sweat gland produces a 
thinker type of secretion which is much more associated 
with body odor. The underarm areas do not allow rapid 
evaporation of perspiration and is warm and moist, so the 
.bacteria have a longer time to act and more odor is 
^produced. Underarm odor can be controlled fairly 
^Successfully by frequent washing to get rid of the residue of 
'sweat. This can be inconvenient or impossible in hot 
weather when most people sweat fairly heavily, thus the 
common practice of resorting to an anti-perspirant or 
deodorant. Technically, there is a difference between the 
two since an anti-perspirant stops or slow down 
perspiration but the deodorant merely masks the odor. The 
terms tend to be used interchangeably, however. 

Anti-perspirants and deodorants generally are harm- 
less if used as directed. Antiperspirants contain chamicals 
which inhibit perspiration, but usually do not do so 
completely; these are usually aluminum salts. In addition, 
sometimes when their effect wears off there is a rebound 
and the person sweats more heavily. Women who shave 
their underarms occasionally experience irritation from 
anti-perspirants. This appears to occur when the stuff is 
applied immediately after shaving. To avoid the irritation, 
a woman can shave her underarms in the evening and apply 
the anti-perspirant the next morning.

ByPHJLHARTMANN 



. And fans, especially in 1973, 



i U.S. pro sports has always been on the offense. The 
al (in hockey), and TD are welcomed almost without 
exception over the strikeout, save (hockey), and field goal. 

American sports fans Jack class. They just can't seem to grasp the 
finesse of a pitcher's duel or a fine defensive effort in pro hockey, 
basketball, or football. 

Being preoccupied with the high score, fans lose 50 per cent of the 
game and its strategy. For example, when the Boston Celtics thwart the 
Detroit Pistons 98-80, fans and writers will say that the Piston players 
were not moving or didn't have the eye for the basket. Little 
consideration will be given to the fact that maybe, just maybe, they were 
kept off balance by a tight Celtic defense. 

Some readers may wait that 1 think too harshly of American sports 
fans; that the goal-line stand, double play and frozen puck are really 
considered wonderful, crucial parts of their sports. 

Don't kid yourselves. You hate a frozen puck, you know you do. It's 
boring; it stops the action. 

But with the action offense must come the un-action defense. The fast 
break we all know and love inevitably will sometimes be throttled by an 
equal defense. And there undoubtedly will be times when the long bomb 
will be easily batted away by an experienced defender It's the name of 
the game and you can't change it! 

But, sports fans of America, you have tried. You clamored loud and 
mighty for more hits and homers in baseball several years ago (to go with 
your hotdogs, beer, and cushioned seats) and persisted until the baseball 
owners did something about it. They lowered the pitcher's mound, 
effectively hurting the hurler by throwing him off balance. 

And the result was a few more glimpses of action. 

Now you seem ready to pounce on your favorite fall sport, pro 
football. The punt and field goal have become too common for your taste. 

You would just love to see the rules changed to put more emphasis on 
the scoring game. And if the delicate balance between offense and 
defense is thus destroyed, so what? It's the action that counts. 

In Europe the great national pastime is soccer. You will find that 
sports enthusiasts over there appreciate a mammoth defensive struggle 
just as much as its counterpart. 

To them the fine balance is the key to everything: Europeans would 
have it no other way. They are professional spectators. 

PILL-POPPING IN PRO FOOTBALL 

Several years ago there was a great furor in the National Football 
League over the alleged widespread pill-popping habits of many of its 
athletes. Retired players told their stories of blatant use of amphetamines 
and other drugs. 

Club officials for the most part denied the stories and conducted a bit 
of token fact-finding just to please outraged fans. But just recently a 
relatively unknown Washington Redskin center revealed that 
pill-popping has not vanished from the pros. 

So instead of worrying about rule changes, NFL officials should start 
speading their time researching this area of the game. Amphetamines 
can distort an athlete's ideas about his potential and ultimately hurt him 
or even an opposing player 

If a pro athlete has a bad game as a straight, then he can go home and 
get high to forget his woes. In that case, more power to him. But let's hope 
he leaves his pills at home before the big game.

game that was decided early. Taylor 
used j|s heighlh advantage to open a 
quick lead over the Mastodons. They 
continued their dominance of the 
game with an effective weaving 
offense and a torrid fast break. 

Taylor broke out into an early 10-2 
lead, but three quick baskets by Rex 
Putt pulled the Mastodons within four 
at 12-8. This was the closest the 
Mastodons were ever able to get. The

The second half was similar to the 
first, as the Taylor five outscored the 
visitors 10-2 in the first two minutes. 
However, the Mastodon offense began 
to pep up and penetrated a light zone 
defense consistently. Indiana-Purdue 
managed to keep pace with the hosts 
the rest of the way, and nearly held 
Taylor under 100 after giving them 57 
first half points. They hit 100 with only 
Kl seconds left of the game. 

The powerful Taylor offense was

Dan Grussing and Rex Putt led 
the throttled Mastodon offense with a

the Mastodons will play their sixth

Cedarville in 93-73 triumph 

Indiana -Purdue lost their sixth 
straight game of the year 93-73 to 
Cedarville College in a college 
basketball game Saturday afternoon 
at the Cedarville Campus. 

The hosts jumped out to a quick 
lead behind a good fast break, and 
took advantage of many Mastodon 
miscues to grab a secure 19-point lead 
at half time. The Mastodons contin- 
ued to fall further back in the second 
half, and prevented a final wide 
margin with an aggressive last 
quarter rally 

Cedarville scored first on a 
corner shot and then used an effective 
double teaming defense to set up 
many easy baskets. Then CedarviUe 
yielded lay ups to Grussing and Putt, 
but still hustled to a 18-10 lead. The 
Mastodon five was cold from the field 
and careless in their ball handling as 
they allowed their hosts to expand the 
lead. By halftime intermission Cedar- 
ville led by a 45-26 tally. 

Both teams came out running in 
the second half, but the Ohio bunch

The Mastodon first five returned 
with ten minutes to go and the score 
78-35. Foreseeing another embarrass- 
ing slaughter, the Mastodons went to 
work and lowered the deficit to a 
more respectable level. Rex Putt and 
Gary Gray went to the boards hard, 
while Dean Putt and Gary Trump 



Mastodons scored an almost unbeliev- 
able 36 points in the last ten minutes. 
In the last quarter the Mastodons

IU-PU blasts Concordia 

The Indiana-Purdue Mastodons 
racked up their first victory of the 
season as they breezed past the 
Saxons from Concordia 93-72 in a 
college basketball game Tuesday 
night at the Concordia campus. 

The Mastodons used a running 
game and accurate shooting to post 
their first win in seven contests. The 
smaller Saxons penetrated the Masto- 
don defense often, but they couldn't 
stop the potent Mastodon offensive 

The Mastodons jumped out into 
an early 24-10 lead behind the hot 
shooting of guards Gary Trump and 
Dean Putt. The Saxons suddenly fired 
up and closed the deficit to 28-22. King 
was led the rally with three 
consecutive baskets from long range. 
Concordia showed aggresive play, but 
their lesser talent was apparent, as 
the Mastodon's, who played sluggish- 



o the locker 



The Mastodons, who are known 
for their early second half letdowns, 
surprised the rooting spectators by 
coming out hot in the second half. 
Dean Putt continued to rifle in long 
range shots, and freshman Dave 
Peterson scored consistently under- 
neath, many times on offensive 
rebounds. The Mastodons quickly 
opened up a 15-point lead and never 
let up the rest of the way. Even though 
starters Gary Trump and Rex Putt 
were on the bench with four fouls 
apiece, the Mastodons had no trouble 
pulling away for an easy victory. 



Peterson, Gary Trump, and Gary 
Gray all hit double figures with 17, 14, 
and 10 points respectively. Reserves 
Keith Mendenhal! and John Ford 
came off the bench to contribute 10 
points between them.

STATE BASKETBALL 

It was a successful opening for Indiana's Big Three basketball teams 
last weekend. Notre Dame's Fighting Irish crushed Valparaiso 112-62 
while the Purdue Boilermakers stomped Southern Illinois-Edwardsville 
117-71. The third ranked Hoosiers of Indiana stopped the Citadel 74-55. 

Notre Dame, ranked eighth, used a balanced scoring attack to 
embarrass Valparaiso. Freshmen sensation Adrian Dantley led the Irish 
attack with 16 points while John Shumate pumped in 15. Digger Phelps' 
men hit on 56 per cent of their shots from the floor for the opening season 

For coach Fred Schaus of Purdue it was a game to watch the second 
string. Playirg at home, the Boilermakers crushed SIU-Edwardsville (a 
team even IU-PU plays) by 46 points. The game was a close contest until 
Purdue broke a 4-4 tie in the first half. Frank Kendrick and John Garrett 
each poured in 20 points before the West Lafayette crowd. 

I was in Bloomington last Saturday and managed to catch a view of 
the number three Hoosiers in action against The Citadel. The game was 
quite boring because Bob Knight was moving his players in and out so it 
was hard to get a real good look at any of the players. 
The two most impressive players on the court were sophomores Quinn 
Buckner and Scott May. May led the scoring attack with 14 points and 
locked very aggressive on the boards. Although Buckner only tallied 
eight points, his hounding defense caused many turnovers by the 
opposition. His quick hands made many steals which is why he reminded 
me of Walt Frazier. 

Freshman Kent Benson, Indiana's 1973 "Mr. Basketball," must have 
had an off day— maybe because of nervousness. Benson managed only 
eight points and four fouls in the time he was in. But give this "rookie" 
time and he can dominate the game. 

Sophomore Bob Wilkerson also scored eight points as a sub and made 
some good passes. Look for this guy to get better, and better, and better... 

The Hoosiers have got a young ballclub that will win the NCAA 
championship one of these years. When Bill Walton retires after this 
year, the Bruin dynasty will end with either IU or Notre Dame taking 

IU-PU BASKETBALL 

The IU-PU basketball tea m has been going through some rough times 
lately. But this can change with a little fan support, so come out and cheer 
the Mastodons when they play this week. This week's schedule is as 
follows: 

Thursday, December 6 against Northwood at Central Gym at 8:00 
p.m. 

Saturday, December 8 against Spring Harbor at Central Gym at 8:00 
p.m. 

Tuesday, December 11 at St. Francis College at 8:00 p.m. 

Wednesday, December 12 against ISU-Evansville at Central Gym at 



Some fan support would help the team, so pick out at least two of 
these games to attend. All of the games are in the city so it would be a 
good time to see your school in action.
