grab a bite to eat. He gets the usual - a cheeseburger, fries, and 
a pop. And since it's a nice day, he decides to eat outside. Now,

purposes. The Fort also supplies students with a receptacle for 
disposal of aluminum cans, which are then recycled. 

Hagar went on to say thai slyrolo.-nn w. the most economical 
material that can be used. Paper, according to Hagar, costs 2 to 
3 times as much as styrofoam That figure is roughly the same 
for glassware. As of now, if students want an alternative to 
styrofoam packaging, then they will have to pay higher prices to
