The smoking controversy dominated 
the Wednesday, Sept 2, Student Sen- 
ate meeting. With Chancellor Thomas 
Wallace present, the Student Senate 
voted, in a secret ballot, lo uphold 
President Kurl Gregory's veto of 
resolution 8788-2. 

The resolution, which passed un- 
animously last week, withheld Stu- 
dents' Government support for the 
Chancellor's smoking policy Five 




Chantellor Tom Wallace 
(photo by Shabhir Morriswalla) 
senators voted to override, four to 
sustain, and one abstained. Under the 
constitulion, a two-thirds majority is 
required to override a veto. 

Gregory, who had issued a three- 
page explanation of his veto before the 
meeting, stated in his presidential re- 
port that the major impact of the 
Student Senate resolution would be lo 
"unnecessarily piss off the Chancel- 
lor" and lo "alienate the president 
from ihe senate." Gregory charged 
the senate of not having read key 
documenls. 

Gregory then yielded lo Wallace, 
who began by identifying himself as a 
non-smoker who doesn't "like lo be 
where there's smoking." Wallace then 
made a building by building compar- 
ison of both his policy and the one 
recommended by the Steering Com- 
mittee last July Wallace said he had 
actually implemented "almost one 
hundred percent" of Ihe commiltee's 
recommendations: smoking sign!i had 
been posted, ashtrays had been re- 
moved from non-smoking areas and a 
smoking cessation program will begin 
Wednesday. Sept. 23, in cooperation 
with the Wellness Power Program and 
lociij HMOs 

Nonetheless. Wallace faulted the 
committee for its "ideological" split: 
the committee's aiK non-smokers had 
all voted to endorse Ihe committee's 
report, whereas the committee's three 
smokers dissented. 

Wallace also claimed concern about 
the lack of student participation on Che 
committee and worried that the one- 
third of the student body who smokes 



would complain about the lack of 
smoking areas. When reminded he 
had appointed the committee himself, 
Wallace explained the committee had 
lieen drawn from a list of names 
submitted by chair Barb Blauvell. 

When it came to the lack of separate 
ventilation systems, Wallace reminded 
the senate the original Faculty Senate 
resolution called for separate ventila- 
tion pending engineering studies and 
Ihe true cost of the proposal would be 
unknown pending a report from the 
Faculty Senate Appropriations Com- 
mittee Then quoting Physical Plant 
Director Dan Katter, who said the 
smoke should clear the air, Wallace 
said a separate ventilation system 
might prove unnecessary. 

As to enforcement, Wallace said the 
police would respond to smoking 
complaints when summoned, and 
issue tickets and fines, but would not 
go on "smoking patrols" because that 
. would force the University to hire 
more policemen. Wallace also said 
traditional grievance procedures could 
be used to-resolvc smoking problems. 

Wallace concluded by repeating his 
claim that the campus was now 
"ninety-eight percent smoke-free" and 
that his program had earned praise 
from the American Lung Association. 

The chancellor's remarks drew 
sharp criticism from Vice-President 
Phil Downs. Downs accepted the tact 
that Ihe university is ninety-eight 
percent smoke-freo by square footage, 
but contended the statistic was mean- 
ingless, because students can only 
"hang around in" limited areas such 
as lounges. 

Downs then rejected the idea that a 
ventilation system would be unneces- 
sary. Downs said it was obvious the 
smoke could travel to other areas, as 
was evident in Kettler basement. 
Pointing out thai Katter smokes, 
Downs discounted the Physical Plant's 
director's statements. As lor the 
committee split. Downs argued "un- 
animity would be hard to get." and 
said he "was upset we cannot strive 
for excellence," 

Gregory introduced into evidence 
Uie preliminary results of a random 
sample poll he had commissioned. Of 
those polled, forty-four percent were 
happy with the smoking policy, 
twenty-two percent wanted a stronger 
policy, and the remaining thirty-two 
percent were evenly split between 
those who didn't know or care about 
the smoking policy. 

While Gregory interpreted the poll 
as both a show of support and an 
argument to wail to see how well the 
policy, works. Downs countered Ihe 
same poll showed that no one wanted 



a weaker policy 

Senator Sandy Hadley, who had 
helped with the poll, suggested the 
senate had been "hasty" in passing 
the resolution, and that perhaps the 
senate should wait until spring to re- 
view Ihe policy Downs countered that 
spring was a "vague time" to hold a 
review and wondered how well stu- 
dents would be represented. The final 
smoking policy, made by the chancel- 
lor alone, had no student input al all, 
Downs said. 

Wallace then accused the vice- 
president of wanting "no smoking at 
all" on the IPFW campus, and re- 
peated his claim that his policy im- 
plemented almost all the committee 
wanted. Wallace also said students 
"were more represented because of 



me" and said his original request lo 
have the Implementation Committee 
report lo both Ihe Student and Faculty 
Senates was rejected. 

Allcr Ihe vote all sides seemed 
eager to downplay the impact. 
Wallace, who remained after Ihe 
meeting to answer student questions, 
said he refused to view the vote as 
either a victory or a defeat but that 
simply the Senate had all the facts on 
vole lo override, 

Wallace also invited Downs to his 
office to discuss future problems. 
Gregory echoed similiar sentiments. 
Downs said he was glad the Chancel- 
lor could come lo discuss student 
concerns. Senator Robert Bishop 
shrugged the vole off as . 
in democracy." 



Senators inducted 



Al the Wednesday. Sept. 2, meeting 
of the Student Senate. Chancellor 
Thomas Wallace talked about the 
implemenlation of the smoking policy. 
A vote to possibly overturn the veto by 
Student Body President Kurl Gregory 
took place later that evening. 

In his report, Wallace said that the 
smoking policy was supported by the 
American Lung Association. "They 
slated thai i( was a good star) on a 
new policy," commenled Wallace. He 
also said that on Wednesday. Sept. 23. 
a four-week class for smoking 
cessation would begin, 

Wallace also claimed he wanted to 
take the implemenlation back lo the 
students and that the Faculty Senate 
said they do not have to do that. 
Wallace stated, "We needed the stu- 
dent's input. I was about Ihe only one 
trying to get their input " 

After a lengthy discussion between 
the senate and Wallace, a secret vote 
took place in which the outcome was 
five yes, four no, and one abstention. 
Therefore Ihe result was that there is 
no resolution and the velo stands as is. 

Gregory commented, "My reaction 
is I don't consider it a victory but I do 
consider it an informed decision. 
When the senate passed it, many of 
the senators did not read the com- 
mittee report nor the chancellor's pol- 
icy. After I presented it lo them, they 
made a much better choice." 

Vice-President Phil Downs slated, 
"1 am upset because we cannot strive 
for a excellence at this university." 



He was referring to the smoking pol- 
icy, in which there were nc 
enforcement provisions. 

Other affairs cvered al Ihe meeting 
were the Stud' ..i Senate link-up with 
Bloominglon and subscription for re- 
ports on Ihe general assemblies by 
using the FAX machine. 

Also Senator Rob Bishop gave a 
report on the leadership conference 
that took place at Indiana University. 
This was attended by Bishop; Mary 
Brant, director of Sludent Activities 
and Leanne Fredrick, a represcnlativf 
from the Sludenl Union Board 01 
Governors (SUBOG). The conference 
provided a forum (or tlie discussion of 
topics related lo student govern- 
ment, programming, and campus 
organizations. 

SUBOG reported on the Sunday, 
Sept. 13, Henry Lee Summer concert 
and the Friday, Sept. 18. Hawaiian 
dance at Ihe Hoagland Hayloft 
SUBOG is made up of about eight 
students with Indra Malulionis as 
chair and Wayne King as the vice 
chair. 

Also discussed al Ihe meeting i 
the campus television sets. All will 
slay where they are with a big screen 
l.v. now located on the fii-st and sec- 
ond floors of Walb Memorial Union. 
The t.v. in Ihc Classroom -Medical 
Building will also slay 

There was also discussion about 
passing legislation abouL the Faculty 
dining area in Walb, and finally, two 
new senators were inducted into the 
senate. They are Teresa Dunlap and 
Tina Long. There are now 12 members 
on the senate. 



IPFW attempts to meet female students needs 



Women outnumber men on the 
iPFW campus by more ihan i.ooo. 
according to enrollment figures re- 
leased by the registrar's office. 

John C. Dahl. registrar and assist- 
ant vice chancellor for Information 
Systems, reported the total enrollment 
at IPFW at 10,584, with 5,836 women 



and only -1,748. men. Of the women 
students. 3.B35 are 22 years of age and 
older and arc re-entry students. 

These figures represent the contin- 
uous changes at IPFW within the stu- 
dent body and are reflected in changes 
in structure which include Ihe devel- 
opment of two departments at IPFW 
designed lo meet the needs of female 
students.

Single parents gain support 



On Wednesday, Sept. 16, from 1 lo 4 
p.m., single parent students are in- 
vited to join a support new group at 
IPFW. 

"We want single parents, male or 
female, custodial and non-custodial," 
stales Tina Long of the Women's Cen- 
ter. "Just because it's the (Women's 
Center) sponsoring this doesn't mean 
it's for women only. Men have 
children, too." 

The firsi meeting is t&gt;eing held on 
the lower level of the Walb Memorial 
Union in Ihe Fairfield Room, and is 
informal Long says, "Some people 
arc Itxi busy in the evening for pro- 
grams and help groups. Having the 
reception from I lo 4 p m. will enable 
more to attend, if only for a minute 



between classes " 

Many organizations will be present, 
including PWP I Parents Without 
Partnersi, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, 
and the YMCA and VWCA. all wilh

find possible car pools, babysitting 
trades and other pertinent needs thai 
occur when parents try lo juggle 
school, work, and children. 

Long feels there is a need lor this 
type of group on campus, "if we can 
pool our experiences, trials and trib- 
ulations, and know as single parents 
that we are not.alone, then we've 
accomplished what we set out lo do."

and Ihe Women's Center focus ( 
different aspects of women and 

Women's studies is an academic 
concentration centered on women and 
surrounding issues and developments. 
A minor of IS credit hours is offered 
as an academic program by the 
department. 

A minor in women's studies is "one 
of Ihe few things that is applicable in 
every field," stated Linda Fox. 
coordinator of the program. 

Early in 1970. Kathryn Adamsky 
pioneered the program al IPFW, and 
Jeannelte Klausen assumed the role of 
coordinator from 1970 to 1982 Klausen 
was then succeeded by Fox. 

Five classes are offered this year 
under the interdisciplinary women's 
studies program, and have an average 
enrollment of eighteen students per 
class. 

Goals of these classes, offered under 
the program, include: analyzing ac- 
ademic discipline from a feminist's 
perspective; encouraging original 
scholarship and research about 
women ; integrating self-exploration 
with academic skills; providing a non- 
authoritarian learning environment 
which values students' ideas and en- 
courages an open exchange of infor- 
mation and opinions; and promoting 
knowledge of the diversity of problems 
faced by women, whether they are 
lesbians, ethnic and racial minority 



working class, older, differ- 
ently-abled. or from olher 
disadvantaged groups. 

A resource cenler, offering research 
done on women from 1970 lo the pres- 
ent, including periodicals not found in 
the Helmke Library, is available for 
the students and faculty in the office 
of women's studies in Classroom- 
Medical room 2T2. 

Beginning in October, a revolving 
women's art exhibit will adorn the 
walls of the women's studies office 
The artwork on display will be rotated 
every two months. 

Office hours are from 9:30 a.m. lo 
2:30 p.m. weekdays 

The Women's Center focuses on 
supporting women through the transi- 
tional period in changing their life- 
styles. The Women's Centers opened 
Nov. 19, 19B6, and offers women 
workshops, peer counseling, referral 
service, college orientation, and sup- 
port network. 

'i feel my chief goal here is support 
by being here for women on campus in 
whatever capacity that I can," said 
Terry Worman. coordinator for the 
Women's Center. 

Tina Long, a staff member, works in 
conjunction with Worman in her 
duties.

The Communicator 



Thursd»v, Stpiembcr 10. 1987 



University publications 
adhere to first amendment 



College administrations often 
overstep their boundaries by trying 
to censor that which is protected by 
law. 

On every college campus the 
possibiMty exists of the adminis- 
tration taking hberties with the 
facts and attempting to censor 
their respective student 
publications. 

Thev may attempt this through 
various ways: removing papers 
they don't want circulated to in- 
fluential people, leaning on a 
chairperson of publications or pos- 
sibly threats to cut funding 

Naturally, an administration is 
concerned with the image of their 
college. However, this should not 
be resolved by hiding defects that 
could be settled by simply listening 
to their students. 

Administrations may feel that 
because the college partially funds 
the publication they are allowed to 
dictate what is printed. Fortu- 
nately, we do not live under a dic- 
tatorship and this is not the case 
The Constitution guarantees free- 
dom of speech and of the press and 
therefore college publications are 
protected from such harassment. 

There have been numerous court 
decisions that have upheld these 
rights. For example, the 1971 Su- 
preme Court case of Trujillo vs. 
Love found that "once a student 



publication has been established by 
the institution, the administration 
may not then place limits upon the 
use of that forum which interfere 
with protected speech,' This applies 
to all cases, even when the pub- 
lication is fully funded by the in- 
stitution, Financial support does 
not presuppose the ability to place 
any limitations or control on the 
publication. 

In other words, the administra- 
tion is not authorized to have an 
advisor or any other employee read 
copy prior to publication. Nor can 
it force a publication to print 
something against the staffs 
wishes. 

Perhaps some administrations do 
not realize that the combination of 
constitutional rights and precedents 
in the courts means that they are 
fighting for a lost cause in trying to 
censor student publications 

This publication has never and 
will never allow itself to be coerced 
into or abstained from printing 
copv that may affect the univer- 
sity's image, 

the Communicator strives to 
print only facts and editorializes 
only in hopes of bettering the 
uniVersitv- 

Hopefully, our administration 
will avoid censoring this pub- 
lication for moral, ethical and legal 
reasons.

New requirements for future lU students 



Freshmen entering any 
campus ot Indiana Univer- 
sity in the fall semester of 
1991 will be affected by a 
new admissions policy 
which is designed to Insure 
that beginning under- 
graduate students are 
properly prepared for col- 
lege work. 

According to Sara 
McNabb. university regis- 
trar and university director 
of admissions, Ihe new 



admissions policy has two 
major changes. 

"Students entering lU 
during the 1991-92 academic 
year must have completed 
28 semesters of college prep 
work (compared lo the 
current 26 hours re- 
quired),'" McNabb said 
And, "We have now actu- 
ally Itemized what courses 
a student must lake in high 
school (The current policy 
only specifies eight semes- 



ters of Enghsh and 'rec- 
ommends' Ihe remainder of

McNabb noted (hat the 
university has a number of 
obligations, and one of those 
Is to advise prospective 
students about what Is ex- 
pected of them before they 
comeiolU 

"With this new policy." 
she said, "we are giving the 
schools - and the freshmen 
entering high school this 



tall - four years' notice 
about what lU expects from 
Its applicants," 

She added that with lU's 
new admission policy, the 
standards are comparable 
to requirements al the other 
Big Ten schools. 

The new admissions pol- 
icy for Indiana University, 
which has been approved by 
the lU Trustees, requires: 

1) Graduation from a 
commissioned Indiana high 
school or comparable out- 



eliminating the use of In- 
diana's high sulfur coal. 
The solution comes from 
developing technology to 
Ihe point where we can 
burn this inexpensive 
energy source cleanly," 
said Harper. "Thai would 
give Hoosiers and Hoosier 
business a safe and in- 
expensive energy source." 

The Allen County law- 
maker added that the board 
is important because it 
frequently recommends 
bills to the stale legislature. 
Harper is one ot eight ad- 
visory members to the 
eleven -member board.

To the editor 

New policy deceiving 



To Ihe edilor: 
Your editorial on 
Thursday, Sept. 3, stated 
that Student Senate may 
be disregarding a "per- 
son's constitutional right 
to have the freedom of 
choice to smoke." A per- 
son may have the free- 
dom of choice lo smoke, 
but nobody has a con- 
stitutional right to smoke. 
The Surgeon General's 
report clearly establishes 
that breathing second- 
hand smoke (smoke irom 
the end of a cigarette i 
causes disease, including 
lung cancer. Courts have 
found that a person's 
right lo breathe air free 



of smoke is superior to a 
person's right to smoke. 

Also, to point out that 
only two percent of the 
campus is designated for 
smoking is misleading. 
Over half of Ihe lounges 
available to students are 
designated smoking 
areas, as well as several 
lobby areas. Those are 
Ihe areas where you will 
most likely find students 
when Ihey are not in 
class Student Senators 
are correct when Ihey say 
that loo much space has 
been provided for 
smoking, 

Barbara Clauvclt 



vance notice, said Annette 
Goben, director of Com- 
munity Regulations. 

Golwn suggests that per- 
sons who want lo slop by 
the center call Ihe commu- 
nity-relations office al 317- 
494-INFO to check on limes

their music and message. A 
band (hat is incapable of 
producing bad music. A 
band that keeps changing 
with every groundbreaking 
album. In short, a band like 
REM. 

With the release o[ 

"'Document*', i their fifth 
album, excluding an E.P, 
and a compilation of un- 
released backlogi, the band 
again redefines the rock-n- 
rott standards, blending 
R&amp;B. psychedelia, and 



country rhythms in(o the 
unmistakable sound that 
makes this album one of the 
highlights of this year. 

The sound is very B.E.M., 
yet very different, with 
some horns making an ap- 
pearance, a first. 

The feel of the album is a 
laboring, working one. 
Right from the first song. 
"Finest Worksong." the 
music digs in and works. 
Many topics and issues arc 
covered here; just look at 
the names of the songs: 
"Welcome to the Occupa-

(And ] Feel Finci" a lighl- 
hcarled essay on the nu- 
clear scare; and "Odd- 
fellows Local 151" a bizarre 
statement about lodges. 

Other songs include '"The 
One I Love," the single off 
(he album: an exuberant 
rocker entitled "Slrange." 
which is the only song the 
band did not write: and 
"King of Birds.'" a beautiful 
song that rejoices in nature. 



Tlie first thing thai I 
noticed about this album is 
Ihc advancement in musical 
ability thai Ihc band has 
displayed. 

Peter Buck is marvelous 
on guitar, covering every- 
thing from "metal" riffs to 
plucking a banjo Mike 
Mills IS a very respectable 
bass player, providing 
funky tempos, and his 
backing vocals are simply 
wonderful. Bill Berry is a 



creative drummer, able lo 
lake anything and every- 
thing his mates play and 
provide a great backbeat. 
And of course Michael 
Stipe, perhaps one of the 
greatest vocalists of the 
age, howling and yipping 
through his mumbling, 
murmuring Georgian 
accent. - 

I would call ■■Document" 
a dark album, though not as 
dark as their third album. 



"Fables of the Reconstruc- 
tion." II is a grilly album, 
yet very clean, with a dusty 
feel, yet a polished sound. 

You can judge for your- 
self. "'Document" does not 
surpass "Fables'" or their 
first album, "Murmur," but 
It is still R.E.M. . and il is 
truly a fantastic work.

remains the same, but the 
food has improved 
dramatically. 

One of (he best changes 
the Fori has made is in 
their extended hours. Last 
year, if one gol Ihe mun- 
chies but didn't want to 
leave campus and it was 



after I p.m , it was touch 
loodles One would be 
forced to eat Ihe surrogate 
food offered up by the 
vending machine. This year 
one can get hungry as late 
as four o'clock and still get 
a hot dish and a smile at 
Ihe Fort, 

What really matters, of 
course, is the food. And the 
food looks good. It's color- 
ful. Not loo much green or . 
tieige. A nice variety. 

There is also a nice vari- 
ety of types of food avail- 
able. For the health nut, 
there is a salad bar. For the 
grease freak, there is the

there is well-balanced 
meals with meat and veg- 
gies and usually some kind 
of potato 

A definite advantage is 
that Ihey don't just dump 
everything on your piale If 
one is not fond of spinach, 
one needn't have it depos- 
ited on one's plate. To finish 
the meal off there is a va- 
riety of desserts such as 
pies, cakes, and purldings. 

Taste"* On yeah, that is 
rather imporlant, isn't it? 
Well, on Ihe day of review, 
the main meal was roast 
tirrkey, mashed potatoes 
and spinach. The spinach 1 
cannot account for since I 
chose not to have it The 
mashed potatoes were a 
nice consistency They 
could have t)een a little 
spicier, but there is salt and 
pepper lying about so one 
can spice to one's own 
specifications. ^ 



The roast turkey was 
surprisingly good consider- 
ing it most likely come oft a 
turkey roll. It was a little 
overcooked but nothing 
unforgivable. 

One of the best parts 
about eating in the Fort 
cafeleria is the quiet Few 
children eal in the Fori and 
one does not have to con- 
tend with their loud ob- 
noxious behavior one has to 
put up with in the local fast 
food places 

Food, ambiance, color, no 
children, - all for $3 lo S5. 

All in all, eating at the 
Fort was an enjoyable ex- 
perience. The extended 
hours helps fil good nutri- 
tion into everyone's class 
schedule and Ihe selection 
of food is wide enough to 
accommodate the serious 
dieter and the serious junk 
food junkie 

So it's not exotic cooking; 
still, your mother would 
approve.
