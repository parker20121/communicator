Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne 



Students, professor speak out about impending war 



If It hasn't already hap- 
pened by The Commiinicaior's 
publication on Wednesday, war 
wilh Iraq is expected to start at 
any time. While some IPBV sru- 
denls interviewed Monday 
believed thai Hussein is njlh- 
less, Ihey don'l believe that 
launching a new desert bailie 
against his regime is justified. 

President George W. Bush 
gave his 48-hour ultimatum for 



lo 



Ira 



Monday evening, lelling the 
American people "peaceful 
ciforls to disarm the Iraqi regime 
have failed again and again 
because we are not dealing with 

"This regime has already 
used weapons o( mass deslruc- 
lion against Iraq's neighbors and 
against Iraq's people," Bush 
added America might be next, 
he lears. That is the reason. 
Bush said, that America will act. 
"II has a deep hatred of America 
and our friends, and it has aided, 
trained and harbored 
including operatives ol 
Qacda. The danger is i 
using chemical, biological 
nuclear weapons obtained 
the help of Iraq, the ' 



could fulfill their staled 
tions and kill thousands of mno- 
cent people in our country or 
any other." Bush said. 

IPFW professor of political 
science lames Lutz. who leaches 
Middle East politics, is strug' 
gling wilh tne chief reason 
America is about lo attack Iraq. 
"It's a cumulation of antagonism 
toward Iraq by the current 
administration, Luiz said. 
There is no love losl for Ihe Iraqi 
leader, according lo Lut;. 

"Clearly Saddam Hussein's 
regime is one of the mosi odious 
inthewoild. But then again, the 
international principal general I v 
is that you don't intervene with 
the domestic affairs of another 
country. On the other hand. Ihe 
weapons of mass destruction are 
a perpetual threat," he said. 

'Once you start deciding 
who can stay and who can go in 
governments of other ci 



"Some of the Midc 
govemments will be pleased to 
see Saddam go. Others will be 
very concerned about Ihe 
process. And I think the Middle 
Eastern public will be very con- 
cerned because il's Western 
Middle Eastern 



e agau 



. It's 1 



IVhal's the neil kind of pressure 
that is going to be forliicoming? 
That will give cause (or concern 
for a numtter of governments 
and a number of situalions both 
in the Middle East and else- 
where," Lulz said. 

President Bush's words 
provided a threat of things lo 
come militarily, but several 
IPFW students are hoping it 
won't come lo that. Sophomorc 
pre-med student Elias Zakour, 
originally from Syria, has tieen 
paying close attention to the 
news. Watching CNN Headline 
Neivs while ealing at Ketller 
Hall Monday afternoon. 21akour 
said war is nol the answer. 

"There are loo many other 
ways lo go about this. Tne war 
now is not against the whole 
country — it's against one person," 
Zakour said. But in the current 
situation, Ihe country will suffer, 
not Hussein, 

"All in all, there needs to be 
any other solution other Ihan 
war. It will nol solve the prob- 
1cm as a whole. There will come 
someone else," he explained. 
"Il's obvious thai war is bad for 
everybody." 

For now, Zakour is not wor- 
ried about his own family who 
currently live in Syria, He talks 
to them frequently and doesn't 




sense much teruion. even 
though their country borders 

They're not worried, and 
Ihal makes me not worried 
about them," Zakour said. 
There wasn't even much fear for 
a relative who was working in 
Baghdad as of Monday, he said, 
although he was probably leav- 
ing soon, Zakour explained. 
That relative told Zakour that 
Baghdad was already suffering 
economically, but recently it has 
become a more dire situation. "II 
used to tie bad, but now il is 
worse." Zakour said. 

Other students aren't 
pleased with the rate of accelera- 
tion wilh which America has 
launched inio war-mode. "It 
seems like he's rushing things a 
little bit," freshman Jessica 
Burton said, "It almost seems 
like he (President Bush) is trig- 
ger happy" 

The elementary education 
major feels more should have 
been done with the United 
Nations before America goes 
against Iraq in a unilateral move. 
"We were Ihe ones Ihal helped 
form it, so 1 don'l think we 
should go againsi it. Afler the 
war. what is mat going lo be like 
with thtU.N.?" she added. 

On Monday night, shortly 



after addressing Ihe nation, the 
Terror Alert Level was raised lo 
Orange — second highesi — 
with Ihc United Stales' govern- 
ment worrying about possible 
terrorist attacls triggered by 

Hussein. 

LuB womcs thai by mov- 
ing toward attacking Iraq. 
America might be givmg the 
regime incentive to give 
"weapons of mass destruclion" 
to terrorist groups. 

Before Ihe fighting breaks 
out. he believes there wasn't 
much incentive for Ihe regime to 
conduct such a move. And he 
remains skeptical about 
America's knowledge of Iraq's 
weapons and mo lives. 

The reasons for going to 
war with Hussein date back 
before recent arms inspection 
and Sept. 11. 2001. Lut/ said. 
LuIz also thinks many Iraqis will 
fight America, not because they 
love Hussein, but because they 
will be fighting a foreign invad- 

However. he also believes 
the regime will fall. While that 
will happen, he predicts il won't 
be the end of trouble in Iraq. "11 
will be a long-term problem in 
dealing with attacks wilh VS. 
forces and U.S. allies," he said. 



And while Hussein \vill be 
gone, America will have lo 
rebuild the country. 

"Like Afghanistan, defeating 
the Taliban was the easy part. 
Structuring a new government 
has proven lo be very difficult. 
We still haven't done il," LuIz 
said. "Even if Ihe victory is 
quick, the process will be very 
long, in my opinion," Lutz said, 

One IPFW student finds 
himself torn between wanting lo 
doubt President Bush and want- 
mg lo doubl Ihe Iraoi regime 
which he believes should be top- 
pled. 

"1 think it's insanity... 
Someone has to be backing 
up the political threats, but I 
don't think (America) should 
actually do It. It's good to be 
thrcalening. We need some-

Award winning poet paints verbal portraits of tribulations faced by Jews 



Being Jewish ir\ a Ljtin 
American country in the middle 
of the 20th century was almosi 
as hard as being Jewish in 
Europe at the same time 

Matjorie Agosfn. an awaid- 
winning poet and anthologist, 
came to IPFW on March 3 lo 
speak about Jewish women writers 
from Latm and Central America. 
Agosin. author ol "Angel of 
Memor)'" and "An Absence of 
Shadows," is a poet and post- 
mod emisl writer who focuses 
her topics ol writing on family 
biographies and cultural expcn- 

In Chile, General Pmochet 
had a campaign slogan, 
"Support your counlri'; kill a 
Jew. Because of Pinochet's 




Salvador AUende. Agosin was 
forced lo (lee Ihe countr)' and 
settle in Ihe United States when 
she was 16 years old. 

This experience is one that 
she will never forget. "Il's mote 
than a memory lo me — 1 was 
there, I lived il." 

Agosin remarked thai a 
topic Lnal is fascinating to her, 
and is prevalent in her writmgs, 
is Ihal of cultural adaptation. 
"One of Ihe dichotomies thai a 
Jewish Chilean adolescent faced 
during thai time is that if you 
wanted lo be Jeivish. you had lo 
deny your Chilean nationality.

lewish religion. Vie never truly 
belonged lo lelthcr] of those 
worlds." Agosin paused for a 
moment, and then told her audi- 



ticlongmg IS a form of belonging." 
The professor discussed her 
book about her mother's child- 
hood in Chile, "A Cross and a 
Star." At the time, iDiile was a 
hotbed of Nazi enclaves that 
constantly harassed Agosln's 
mother and grandparents. She 
had lo learn to adapt and tie 
strong. Agosin based this collec- 
lion of prose and poetry on sto- 
ries her mother tofd her 

Another book she wrote, 
entitled "Always Fram Somewtiere 
Else: My JcwL'ih Father," tells of 
how her father, a doctor, escaped 
Ihe laljel "a Jewish doctor'^ in 
Chde orUy lo fmd himself being 
called "a third-world sdcntist" 
in America. 

Agosin said that she has 
always been intrigued by "Ics 
invisibles," literally, 'the invisi- 
bles." These people who have 



been uprooted from their native 
culture and transplanted into a 
new culture often (eel that they 
no longer exist. They try lo 
reclaim their heritage, only lo 
find their memories fuzzy 
twcause of the passage of lime. 
Many of Ihe poems in her 
anthologies relate lo this subject. 

Agos&amp;i always writes in 
Spanish and allows a third parly 
to translate her works into 
English. "Translation is an art; 
however, it is not my art. My art 
is writing. I leave Ihe art of 
translation to its artist," 

When asked what writing 
meant to her, Agosin replied, 
"for me. writing is a form of 
exondsm. II forces me to deal 
with the harsh realities." Agosin 
was surprised at her classification 
OS a wnler. "I never thought of 
myself as a Latin American 



Jewish woman writer." she said, 
"but I guess [when 1 break 
dov/n] the categories, I am." 

She continued lo say thai 
all writers who fit these 
categories cannot be limited lo 
them. Speaking of other Latin 
American Jewish women v/riteis, 
Agosin told the group of 
approximalely four dozen, 'The 
subjects these writers choose are 
as diverse as Ihe women them- 

There is no single "Latin 
American" culture. Agosfn con- 
tinued, "The countries they 
come from are not homoge- 
neous; each country has a very 
different culhire." 

Agosin is a professor of 
Spanish and women's studies at 
Wellesley University in 
Wellesley. Mass.

Health reform: From the Left 



Well, il has been a while 
since 1 have wrillcn. 1 .im Sony 
Ihal Ihe led opinjon has been so 
slrikingly abseni Ihc lasl few 
weeks, especially when Ihere 
arc so many importanl events 
occurring in our nation and in 
the tvorid. 1 have had a crazy 
semester filled willi change. In 
January, I lost a loved one who 
had been suffering From emphy- 
sema for many years, and then I 
had my own struggle with 

I have b«n dealing wilh 
Ihe medical system first hand 
for some time now. So in this 
edilorial, 1 am not going lo 
quote sites and sources. 

I am going lo write in Ihe 
true cditonal style of experience 
and opinion. 1 know first hand 
how budget cuts have affected 
Ihc quality of care for mysetf. 
my loved ones and many other 
Americans, 

The c 



affected Ihe 

our elderly receive 

when they must be 

E laced in nursing 
omes. When I 
first met my friend 
Emily seven years 
ago, i was working 
at the nursing 
home in which she 
lived. Last spring, 
due to the detei 
Emily's physical stale. It became 
necessaiy for me lo place her 
back in a nursing facility. 

The cuts that the Bush 
administration have made, and 
Iheir effect on quality of care.&gt; 
were immediately evident. The 
staffing, which Has never been 
adequate innursing homes, had 
been cut almost in naif. In a hall 
housing over 60 residents, there 
were two aides. There were two 
nurses on duty for the entire 
home, consisting of lour halls. 

If the slaff worked non- 
stop, performing their duties for 
a smglc shift, without Incidenl. 
they would not be able lo pro- 
vide adequate assistance to all 
of Ihe residents. Until Emily 
made Ihc decision to go lo com- 
fort measures only and 1 called 
hospice in to help with her care. 
1 went each day to balhc her. 



and oflen I was the only one 
changing her diapers. This is Ihe 
type of care that our elderly 
receive. TTicy often sil in their

Medicaid now only pays for

The treatment for my 
kidney stones was extensive. 1 
had three surgeries in one 
month. I was hospitalized lor 
two davs during one of Ihe sur- 
geries. They placed me on a sur- 
gical and renal ward. The 
staffing there was incredibly 
short. The nurses wereconslanllv 
busy and still they couldn t 
keep up with the patients' 
needs 1 had an allergic reaction 
to the morphine that they pre- 
scribed and my throat began lo 
close. There 1 was suffering 
from an nnaphylaclic reaction, 
in the hospital, and I had a diffi- 
cult lime getting a nurse to help 

I have learned a great deal 
about suffering and patience in 
the last three month. I received 
the lessor\s the hard way. as a 



participant, I know that a few 
weeks ago when the media 
focus was on an upgraded 
terrorist alert. I think we were at 
code orange at the time, the 
administration pushed through 
a new welfare reform act, cut- 
ting child caie and educational 
programs for reapienls. I know 
from personal eiperience that 
those programs work. 1 received 
them many years ago. The child 
caic and educational programs 
enabled me to learn and earn. 
They enabled me to move out of 
a state of need into self-suffi- 
ciency. 

Sure, in an ideal world 
there would be no poverty and 
no single mothers. There would 
be plenty for everyone, and 
everyone would be nappy and 
healthy; but we don't live in an 
ideal world. The conditions in 
America are much better than 
any third world country, but 
they fall dramatically short 
when compared lo other devel- 

We are a nation 
on the brink of 
destruction. Our 
government has 
rosl sight of the 
people that it rep- 
resents. We are 
only steps away

We spend billions 
upon billioiu of 
dollars on mili- 
tary and space 
proerams, yet the 
weFfare of Ihe 
is cut lo the bare 



We criticize anyone who 
doesn't agree with our current 
agenda. Anyone who isn't with 
us is our enemy. We criticize 
olher nations for letting their 
people starve, yet we let our 
elderly live in homes without 
adequate care, sitting in their 

Americaris remember: (ve 
all age and one day it will be 
you or me sitting in a nursing 
home covered in our oivn vomit 
or waste. Issues never seem lo 
matter unlil they become per-

will affect us all. Maybe it's time 
to care about Ihe quality of 
health care for the poor and 
elderly before it is loo late, 
before il is you.' But that's just 



Mars &amp; Venus: Excess Spending 



Do VOL 

make; 



nio Victoria's Secret with her to help 

her replace the two bras that our dog had chewed 
up. I thought it was hilarious and a good lesson to 
her at Ihe time lo keep her shiff picked up off of 
the floor. II ended up being a good lesson lo me 
thfll women will overpay lor ariythmg. For two 
bras, the grand total was over $60. 

Tvio plain, simple, white bras. Sixty dollars, 
f'ou know how many hours 1 have to work to 
,e S60? Too many. Do you know how many 
pairs of underivcar that 1 can buy for S60? At least 
a dozen, and you can bet that I won't leave them 
on the floor for Ihe dog to chew up, and even if 1 
did I would still wear them! 

Another example of females' tendency to 
overoay can be seen at yout nearest Bath fc Body 
Works. TWenty dollars for a bollle of lolion? 
Please. For Christmas I spent S70 on what essen- 
tially added up to a bottle of vanilla lotion, some 
vnniUa soap, some vanilla body spray and a huge 
pincconc-lookin' basket lo put them m.Abollte of 
vanilla mclract for S2 would serve Ihe same pur- 
pose if used correctly. 

Send any man on a shopping trip for two 
bras, soap, lotion and some body spray, and (ve'U 
come back will all of those for under 30 bucks and 
that's including the cost of lunch! So Venus, if you 
could, justify spending $30 on a bra! 



ing just as good as the models that we are sub- 
ietled to in every Maxim magazine. We buy them 
because we feel a little sexier, and when we feel 
sexier, then we feel more confident. Now, maybe 
you should have asked, "Why spend S30 on a bra 
from Vieloria's Secret?" 1 am convinced that every 
man will understand this — it is one stop shop- 
ping for all bras. In Vicki's. women can find bras 
in varying colors, patterns, strap width, padding 
etc, thus making il one quick, easy slop. No need 
to travel around to different stores lookmg for just 
the right shade of nude because chances ate 
Vicki's will have it. Then, since il is so convenient, 
they feel they con justify charging S30 for one bra. 
This is the idea of supply and demand. Women 
ill always need bras because eventually this 



Seat thmg called gravity kicks in and 
se lift. This is the only lime (tiventies or eaily 
thirties) that women don't have to buy a bra 



purely for support, bul rather for looks. 

On to more important issues such as spending 
SaO on overpriced lotion that makes girls smeU 
like birthday cakes. This is another one of those 
concepts of'^ "making us feel better about our- 
selves." Why do men wear expensive colognes? 
So they don i have to bathe? No. because it makes 
them feel a little more confident. Nowadays the 
use of scented body wash and lotion has replaced 
the maskmg scent of perfume. Whenever you see 
your significant other spoiding S20 on something 
that wQl not only clean them, but leave them 
lightly scented, just know that she probably isn't 
forking out S60 for perfume, thus m the long run 
saving money to spend on more bras. 



Maybe I missed something 



Maybe 1 missed it. 1 just 
read through the enhre United 
States Cor\stitution. and it isn't 
there. 1 easily found freedom of 
speech, the right to bear arms, 
the right to vote and the abolish- 
ment of slavery, but I didn't see 
the amendment guaranteeing 

f;ovemmen1- funded health care, 
magine that. 

Medicare and Medicaid are 
not constitutionally promised to 
anyone. These programs were 
developed lo ensure that certain 
American citizens wiuld have 
health care available to 
them. The disabled, the 
elderly and lower 
income children were 
Ihc intended bcnefidarics 
of this government 
safety net. If it were 
still used in that capacity 
today, we wouldn't be 
having any problems 
with either program. 

Bul things have 
changed in the lost few 
decades. Employer 
provided health cover- 
age, once reserved for 
high-ranking executives, has 
been extended lo cover a large 
portion of the American work 
force. As a result, everyone now 
believes they are entitled to 
health insurance, whether they 
are employed or not. 

As someone who has 
access lo employer- provided 
health coverage. [ fully reltlizc 
how lucky I am to have this ben- 
efit. You see, a few years ago I 
had a serious accident without 
health insurance which resulted 
in a lengthy hospital stay and 
nearly S20.O0O in medical bills. 
When faced wilh this over- 
whelming debl. what did 1 do? 
Did I run to the government and 
o pay ■ - ■ 

tality and look for 
sue? No my friends, I did the 
unthinkable — 1 began lo make 
payments lo the hospital. 

Years later. I am still paying 
for the accident the same way 
my parenis and most of their 
generation paid for all medical 
care, on a monthly payment 
plan. News flash people — 
hospitals ivill take payments 
directly from the patient. I know 
how shocking thai is to some of 
you who have grovm up in the 
"health insurance generation," 
but atone time we all had lopay 
100 percent of our medical bills. 



My god. whal kuid of country is 
this that individuals are expected 
10 pay for seri'ices Ihcy receive? 

Let's get back to Ihc point. 
Medicare and Medicaid are bro- 
ken, misused and abused pro- 
grams thai arc desperately in 
need of fixing. If you have 
fallowed my column, you 
should be aware that t am not a 
fan of most government social 
programs, but this one is both 
necessary and viable — wilh a 
few simple but necessary 
changes. 

First, hospitals and nureing 
homes are gelling reimbursed at 
well below market value for 



lee all senior citizens, disabled 
Americarxs and uninsured chil- 
dren health care and prescrip- 
tion drugs based on family 
income level. Those below the 
poverty level receive free care. 
with an increasing monthly 
"premium" being charged as 
the income level increases. 
Anyone paying a premium is 
responsible for the costs that a 
privately insured citizen would 
mcur. namely a reasoivible co- 
pay and deductible — also 
based on family income level. 
In fad, 1 would also open this 
up lo any working Ainerican 
who is not offered hcallh covei^ 
by their 




services charged to Medicare 
and Medicaid. The simple fact is 
Ihat. as the number of people 
using Ihe programs has 
increased, the government 
funding has not kept up. Every 
year, hospitals are making less 
and less money on a steadily 
increasing client base charging 
bills lo government programs. 
This has caused many hospitals 
lo reduce staffing, raise prices 
and decrease service to all 
patients in an effort to make 

So, we need lo make 
enough funding available for 
the hospitals and doctors to 
receive fair compensation for 
their services. We need to imme- 
diately set the reimbursement 
levels back to a fair level and 
implement a yearly increase that 
will match the inflation rale. 
This will ensure that Ihe hospi- 
tals (and in turn patients) will 
not be penalized tor accepting 
Medicaid patients. 

The problem then becomes 
how we pay lor this increased 
spending, Wc could raise taxes 
(I don't think so), cut olher gov- 
ernment programs (lempling. 
but still no good) or we could 
modify Ihe programs lo make 
them more financially secure 
(let's go wilh this one). 

First thing we do is gunran- 



slatters. {Yes, I called Ibem ille- 
gal aliens — calling them 
undocumented immigrants is 
like referring to a drug dealer as 
an "unlicensed pharmacist.") 
Illegals cost us S3. 7 billion a year 
in Medicare and Medicaid

Striking fear into the hearts of millions 



Macriage is Ihe one ivoid 
that strikes tear mio Ihe heart at 
even the toushesl men around. 
Generally v/ilh the maJes I've 
known, Ihc concept of marriage 
is seen as a lime to settle down 
anil slap on the title "ol' ball and 
chain." Bui for women, stcrco- 
typically. marriage is seen as a 
more joyous lime thai, sadly 
enougfi, Ihcy have been plan- 
ning from early childhood on. 

Often little girls are seen 
"playing bride" during dress-up 
time and quite frankly thai 
thought sickcrM me. Never 
once, like many women do, 
have I sat around fanlasixing 
aboul my dream wedding. 
Honestly, if my boyfriend 
proposed 1o me tomorrow, 1 
would not have Ihe slightest 
clue as to where to start and 1 
like it thai way. 

Righl now, I'm seeing 
more signs advertising for 
bridal shows around town than 
there are actual men popping 
Ihe question. What is it all of a 
sudden thai makes Ihe bridal 
shows so popular? What is the 
current mindset of younger 
women in this town that 1 jusi 
don't agree with or understand? 
Do they all just focus on mar- 
riage? Is this still the highli^t 
of a young girl's life, much like 
it was 30 years ago? Haven't we. 
as females in sociely, moved 
beyond this point in history? 
This dumbfounds mi*. An&gt; there 

really enough bridcs-lo-be in 
the Fort Wayne area lo support 
all these bridal shows? 

Everywhere 1 turn, Ihe idea 
of marriage (from a woman's 
standpoint) is alwavs being 
thtoivn in my face. Is sociely 
trying lo encourage women into 
marriage? In Borders atone, 
there have to be at least ID 
different bridal publicalioris. 
Who really needs lo read all 
those magaiines? How many 
dillcrcnl wedding dresses can 
there possibly be (there is no 
need for hale mail here because 
I do know how rnany different 
types of wedding dresses there 
are)? Who are the bridal maga- 
zine writers creating all these 
magazines for? 



To this question there 

■ Not men — I have never 
once seen a wedding magazine 
litled Groom, which features the 
latest trends in men's tuxedos 
(and yes, there are trends). They 

don'l have magazines with tips (ulurc iiulead of wasting ill 
ndrEssingororlicIesonselecling Okay, so maybe 1 have 

--__,_■_ ■.■--K'i ■., 



ly. Inlemei 
shopping for a wedding dress is 

are all these girls finding the 
lime lo read these magazines 
anyway? Shouldn't Ihey be 
working to earn money for their 



therigt 



all Ihe I 
ties for a carefree wedding. 
IVhy? It's simple — men don't 
care and why should women? 
Oh, I forgot. The lerm bride 
means "soon to be lied down 
wilh laundry and loasling." 
And men Ihink they are lied 

• Women ages 18-30 who 
aren't mamed or engaged — 
some women arc just naturally 
drawn lo Ihe big, glossy maga- 
zines strictly for one thing, the 
dolhes. Yes, I must say that I can 
be guilty of looking at the dresses 
and critiquing them and their 
designers, but then again, for 
Ihc longest lime I ivanlcd to be a 
fashion designer. 

Then there arc those 
women who read Ihc bridal 
magazines in order lo feed inio 
Ihe wedding day fantasy. Many 
women will shun my next com- 
wedding day is 



special, but they should feel 
special every day. not just one 
day out of their whole life. Some 
women claim Ihat on your wed- 
ding day. you make a commit- 
ment to your one Irue and 
undying love that will lost a life- 
lime, mil in actuality, your 
"iDve" should alreadj- be well 
aware of your undyuig devo- 

other. but more 
importantly, to God. 

• Women who arc engaged to 
be married — granted, li I were 
engaged, 1 would need some 
help and I may. m the begin- 
ning, resort to one magazine, 
but not a whole slew of publica- 
tions. Knowing me, I would 
then realize that planning a 
wedding is a lot of work and is 
very stressful and would then 
call a wedding planner. It's that 
easy. I don't need a magazine to 
find a dress. Most women jusI 
need lo look around in stores.

¥or what it's worth

(everyone not in the cull). 

for all this, il also helps to 
be paranoid. And let's face il. 
being paranoid can be an 
adventure in itself.

' Did Ihal fast-food ckrk put

While it can be fun, if you 
gel too involved, paranoia is 
also a bit s tress hjl. That's why 
it's considered a mental illness. 
Of course, that's what those 
"doctors" call it — but can you 
really trust them? 

Me, myself and I, the initial 
Ihrcc members of my cult, arc 
looking (or a name and cause. 
Well, okay, a cause is optional. 
Unfortunalely, good names like 
The Branch Davidians, 
Heaven's Gate and New Kids 
On The Block have already been 
taken. So, being named Scott, 1 
came up wilh a new idea. 

The Consecutive-Doublc- 
Consonanl Cult. 

A 5«l Tot those of us wilh 
conscc ulive-doublc-consonants. 
Perfect for Ihe Kcllys, Larrj's 
and dogs named Buddy in ihe 
world. We will pay homage lo 
the Fragglcs and the Muppets 
— especially Pozzy Beat. 

Everyone harmonize:

cull rule is give all assets to

spell however they desire. How 
lo spell cat? K-A-T-T, Poodle? 
A-N-N-O-Y-I-N-G,) 

Cult members must wear 
Ihe appropriale attire, A lie- 
dyed Dukes Of Hazzard T-shirt, 
a yellow dress over baggy bell- 
botlorns, peiuiyloafers, a ten- 
gallon hat and a pel parrot (or 
ferrel if Ihey have a fear of 
wings). 

Once the paramelers arc 
decided, weird rituals begin. 
When CDCC members greet

tongue lo a double A battery

but the VS- and world govern-

Isn't it obvious? There are 
no eonsecutive-double-conso-

America, Constitution or 
Federal Bureau of Inves ligation. 

Dun-Dun-DUN! 

Our only support might be 
found in Congress, where 
Kermedys slill believe in apple 
pie and baseball. 

Whoa. I belter slow down. 
I'm starting to think I might be 
onto something here. 

That's Ihe nice thing about 
paranoia. If you try hard 
enough, you can always make a 
connection. Why does Ihe

The movie Star Wars? 
Based on a true story, ThirOt 
about it, George Lucas dido'l 
write it until after astronauts 
relumed from the moon — and 
who's to say they didn't find 
R2-D2 among those rocks? 

Who caused the Midwest's 

Clinton's great-grand fa Iher. He 
jumped on Ihe New Madrid 
fault line until he moved it. He 



said if we didn't elect his great- 
grandson president, he'd do il 
again. That's being covered up. 

Who broke up Madoruia 
and Sean Perm's marriage? Bozo 
The Clown. 

See. Aren't conspiracy Ihe- 

Now, For legal purposes, I 
need to remind you Ihal those 
are theories. Ones Ihal 1 made 
up. bul ones that — if enough 
loons follow me — can grow 
and prosper like mold in a 
suigle guy s refrigeralor. 

It's never been proven that 
butlerdies — communist or oth- 
erwise — ever vandalize histor- 
ical sites. And neither Neil 
Armstrong nor Buzz Aldrin 
ever disclosed a droid on Iheir 
customs inventory when 
reluming from space. 

Nor has it been proven Bill 
Clinton's great-grandfather 
caused Ihe New Madrid earth- 
quake. In fact, we can'l pnDve he 
ever jumped. 

And that thing about Bozo 
The Clown? Probably not true. 
There ate no accounts of either 
Madoiuia or Sean Perm having a 
crush on Bozo, although I've 
always thought he was funny — 
Bozo, not Sean, 

Please don'l forivard this 
column lo Mr, Penn. I'm a

But it you do, 1 really

Walking" and "At Close 
Range." Even "Shanghai 
Surprise" if Ihal helps his 
allilude. Okay, I never saw 
"Shanghai Surprise," bul I'm 
sure he did a better job than I 
would. 

All I'm saying is, nowa- 
days it's considered fun lo Iry lo 
rrove negahves — which, even 
wilh Ihe malhemalical brain of 
a spud (English translation;

Movie critics loved il. 
Eberl and Roe per gave it 'two 
thumbs up.' So tell me eiacUy 
why il is Dial "Knockaround 
Cui's" failed so miserably in 
theatres. 

Wilh the world's mosl 
popular action star, VIn Diesel, 
at his rugged best, or so Ihey 
say, why oon'l people like il? 
Around Ihe same time Ihat 
"XXX" was dominating, this 
film, co-starring Barrj' Pepper 
("Enemy of the Stale") and Scth 
Green (Austin Powers" 2 &amp; 3) 
was a huge flop. 

Granted, Diesel is probably 
Ihe mosl overrated action star 
ever. I mean, he once again 
dons fake tatloos in this film (he 
aUo is draivn on for "XXX'l- 
His image is mostly exagjprated. 
Bul who doesn't like seeing 
Diesel kicking ass? From "The 



Fasl and the Furious" to -XX-X,'* 
Diesel is a great action hero. 

And it's nol just the stars 
thai niake the movie. The plot is 
one of Ihe better ones Ihat I 
have seen in many years for an 
action movie. It's an edge of the 

twists and lurm Ihan the 
LeBnDn lames Eligibility Saga, 

Nol to mention, it also 
features one of Ihe greatest 
a dors of our lime in Dermis 
Hopper ("Speed." "Hoosiere"), 
Hopper plays mob boss Bcrmy 
Chains to perfection. It's easy to 
picture Hopper as a mob boss 
and to find him scary, yel he is 
alsocomedic in this role. Thai's 
the sign of a truly superb actor, 

Andrew Davoli makes his 
theatrical mark in this Him. 
Davoli, who has starred in 
numerous episodes of "The 
Sopranos." is right al home in 
this mob film. The New York 
bom Davoli definitely estab- 



lished himself as Ihe somewhat 
umvilling friend Chns Scarpa, 

Starring as Johrmy 
Marbles. Sclh Green brings a 
nice dose of comedy loa mostly 
serious action Tilm. A slor of 
comedic films such as 'Austin 
Powers" 2 &amp; 3 as Scoll Evil and 
in the leen comedy horror flick 
"Idle Hands," Green is much 
needed to make this film what 
il truly isi good. 

And I won'l forgcl Ihe 
work of the tmderappreciated 
work of Pepper, ivhose diakiguc 
wilh John Malkovich is genius. 

So for anyone who is 
skeptical of Knockaround 
Guys" because of ils poor 
Ihealrical draw, don'l be. For 
once, listen to Ihe critics. 

I know il's rare Ihal Roger 
Et&gt;ert can sec past his girlh lo 
give 3 rating that's deserved, 
6ul he docs here. This will sel 
Ihe standard for all action 
movies this decade.

that beautifully. Clothes wctc

most imporlanlly, large numbers 
of empty liquor bottles were 
sitting on the nightsland, with a

The main character, Virginia, 
struggles with many irmer voices, 
including her abusive father. Ed, 
her Iccnaged boyfriend, and 
most importantly, Mr. Adams, 
her ei-violin Instructor thai 
seemed to have a seiuat rela- 



tionship with her. 

All three of these internal 
characters were played expertly 
by Sean Stewart, who was faced 
with a few quick coslume 
cfianges and speedy trarKibon of 
characters. 

"D.C. a I Fine" was quite a 
change from Breitenbach's last 
work performed at fPFtV. 
'Atlas's Cigar." 

Graf, who directed Ihis 
work Id complete his senior proj- 
ecl. also direcled "Atlas's Cigar" 
three years ago when il was first 
performed on campus. "'Alias' 
had a much different dialogue 
than 'D.C, al Fine.' The lines 
were like short monologues. Il 
lold a story Uke a narration. 
['D.C. al Fine'l works on more of 
an emotional level, wilh short, 
choppy dialogue. She 



hi alte 

■ mote emotiona]," 
Graf said of the \vay the show 
was written. 

Graf has heard many Iheo- 
ries as to who Mr. Adams truly 
was. I posed the queshon of Mr. 
Adams actually bemg an incar- 
nation of Samuel Adams beet. 
because he is often tempting 
Virginia lo become drunk. Graf 
wasn't quile sure aboul thai, 
telling me Ihat he has heard Ihe 
opposite, loo, thai Mr. Adams 
could be Ihe cmbodimenl of 
Wrgirua's violin Ihal she keeps 
to remind her of her youth, but 
never plays. 

Virginia, played fantastically 
by Kascy Foster, is having a 
pseud o-relahor« hip with Brent, 
a musician, portrayed by Malt 
Cooper, all the while "denying 



'ho she IS... a violin pla)-er,' 
Graf put it. Foster, although not 
as hard-billen and beaten by the 
cruel hand of lime as one tvould 
cipccl \^rginia to be, conquered 
this difficult role maslerfuUy and 
gave us Ihe sense Ihat she ivas a 
woman with many problems. 

Cooper did a line job in bringing 
what little comic relief Ihe show 
would allow lo the stage, by 
playing the only characlcf who 
nas any sensibilities in Ihe show. 
His portrayal of Bient was sweel 
lo Virginia, and more under- 
standing than Ihe majority of 
men could ever be of her volahlc 
and fickle moods. 

One scene Ihal stuck out in 
my head; al the very end of the 
show, Virginia slood doivnstage 
center with Mr, Adams behind 
her, cutting her wrists with a 



razor blade, (under Ihe guidaiKC 
of Ihe sadistic Adams) while 
holding a violin, as if she was 
plavittg it instead of hurting her- 
self. Maybe it was Ihe swaying 
emohonal violin music played 
over the scene Ihal whispered 
her name, or maybe il was Ihe 
almost sexual way Adams guided 
her thrusts with Ihe blade, bul 
this scene was very memorable 
in this gray, serious play. 

Breilcnbach piesented Graf 
wilh a challenge in writing this 
show, and Graf met Ihat diallcnge 
expertly. Her dark, complex 
characters, which would 
make many Hollywood aclois 
run home crying to their agents, 
were mcl nimbly by Ihe cast.

Flogging Molly in Cleveland 



Riding into Cleveland, 
ready lo help that cily begin 
Iheir St. Patrick's Day festivities. 
Flogging Molly with Mighty, 
Mighty Bosslones and the 
Tossers played a concert at Ihe 
Agora Theatre. 

Even before Ihe concert 
began, concert-goers, mostly 
teenagers, brought in Iheir 
Paddy cheer by being altired in 
green or sporting a shanlrock. 

Those who came seemed 
very adamant aboul seeing one 
band in particular and that band 
was Flogging Molly. The cellic- 
inspired rock from this 
California band has spread 
Ihroughoul Ihe United States 
like the Potalo Famine, as their 
merchandise can be bought at 
pretty much any major retailer al 



The 



expos 



Molly received at 

Warped Tour has only increased 
and thai has become a disap- 
pointment since many who 
enjoy Flogging Molly have never 



heard the Pogues of the 19BOs. 
This caused many people lo nol 
fully appreciate the opening 
band, Ihe Tossers. 

Hailing from Chicago, the 
Tossers aje 10 years old and fuse 
a very traditional sound wilh a 
touch of punk to give their 
music some extra energy. 

The Tossers have become 
hometown heroes in the windy 
city, and aller signing lo Thick 
Records, Ihey have had Ihe 
honor of performing wilh such 
greats as Shane MacGowan, 
Link BO and the GC5 who also

Of rats and 'Willard' 



A "Pied Piper" tale on 
amphetamines, "Willard" 
offers a searing vieiv into the 
darkest realms of Ihe human 

A remake of the 1971 film 
of the same name. Glen 
Morgan's modem lake on the 
story of a boy and his rats is 
filled with sharp camera angles 
and convincing performances 
across Ihe board, 

Willard Stiles (Crispin 
Glover), is an emotionally shint- 
ed man ncaring thirty-some- 
thing, still living beneath the 
thumb of his nagging mother 
(Jackie Burroughs). 

Stooped and broken by 
years of self -doubt and loathing, 
Willard finds friendship in Ihc 
thousands of rats Ihal inhabit 
the cellar of his home. 

After much condihoning 
and patience {and here's where I 
Ihink George W. Bush should 
take a cue from this guy). 



Willard trains the army of rats to 
do his bidding. Maddened by 
thoughts of revenge and an 
increasing paranoia, Willard 
soon finds himself up to his tall 
in rodent troubles. 

Intimale camera angles and 
Hitchcock-ian devices lend on 
almost tactile quality to this 
movie, allowing Ihe audience lo 
view Ihe (corroded) mechanics 
of Willard's head in a way that 
makes us as curious as we arc 

Glover portrays Ihc litle 
role wilh an eerie accuracy, man- 
aging Id evoke both disgust and 
empathy from those who are 
witness lo his inner-struggle. 

The film lacks the gross-out 
quality of Ihe original, however, 
and Glen Morgan's screenplay 
seems lo pack more "squeak" 
than "bile ' where plot is con- 

"Willard" is worth Ihe 
matinee ticket, bul despite all its 
rage, litis film is slill just a rat in 
a cage. Sorry, Smashing

Let's dance 

From page 6 

way into the Sweet 16, 

A packed second round in 
the West will see Arizona State 
battling and beating Kansas, 
Ehike (3) topping Creiehton (6). 
Notre Dame (5) taking out 
Illinois (4) and Ariiona (1) going 
down to long'lime Cinderella 
teamGonzag3(9). 

But wait. I'm not going to 
give Arizona the nod to the field 
on 32 just yet. Thafs right, 1 
watched the finals of the 
American East Conference 
Tournament and I saw the team 
of the future play big. The 
Vermont Cadamounts (16) 
earned their first NCAA 
Tournament bid with a huge 
win over Boston University. 
Junior Matt Shefbc put on a dinic, 
scoring 23 in route to the final 
seconds upsel. Now they are set 
lo go head- to-head with Arizona 
in the 1-16 match. No 16-seed 
has ever beaten a 1-seed in the 
tournament. But if it's going to 
happen anytime soon, it's going 
to nappen wilh Vermont. 

In the Siveet 16 games. 
Duke and Notre Dame tvill take 
the wins, setting up a rematch of 
last year's instant tournament 
classic, this time in the Elite 
Eight. 

Even as a huge Duke fan. 1 
must admit that the Blue Devils 
have struggled a great deal this 
year. Hoivever. they proved in 
the ACC Cimference Tournament 
that tvhen the going gets tough. 
the Blue Devils win — by any 
means necessary. 

Freshman J.J. Redick was 
phenomenal in the finals against 
North Carolina State and he will 
be just as great in this tournament. 
Redick III up Ihe Greensboro 
Coliseum (vith 30 in Ihe ACC 
Tournament and that in my 
mind wasn't even the tip oi Ihe 

In the South Region, a pair 
of first-round upsets should 
occur with BVU (12) topping 



Cormeclicut (5) and Colorado 
(ID) taking oul Big Ten mid-carders 
Michigan Stale (7). But those 
small upsets shouldn't derail the 
inevilnble Regional Oiampionship 
match-up. 

But let's not gel ahead of 
ourselves yel. For all oi you 
Purdue fans (yes. all two of 
you), you can rejoice. Purdue (9) 
will win their first round slug-fest 
wilh LSU (8). However, a nsund- 
two meeting with Te.ias (1) will 
land Purdue enact ly where Ihey 
deserve to be; back in West 

The Elite Eight match in the 
South will see those Texas 
Longhonu do battle wilh the 
streaky Florida Gators (2). 
Streaks are what Rorida is best 
at and judging by their current 
losing streak. Florida should 
rebound right in time lo topple 
Sam Houston (15). Colorado. 
Xavier (3) and Texas on Iheir 
^vay to the Final Four. 

Bul lo anyone who thinks 
Florida is a pushover, you're 
dead wrong. This tsn'l Ihe same 
team that flopped in the finals a 
ievi years back. Mike Miller is in 
NBA purgatory getting splinters 
(a.k.a. riding Inc bencn as a 
Memphis Grizzlie) and Teddy 
Dupay has been shamed away 
from college basketball due to 
his gambling prablerru. Senior 
Matt Bormerand freshman Matt 
WaUh will take the Gators lo 



(11), who will lake oul another I 

Big 12 school in round one when 1 

they will beat Oklahoma State | 
(61. The ACC regular 

champion Wake Forest Demon I 

Deacons (2) will join Oklahoma. I 

Butler and a surging Syracuse I 

(3) in the Sweet 16. But alas, I 

those Deacons will see why I call ] 

Syracuse surging, as will | 
Oklahoma as the Orangemen 
will head to the Final Four. 

In that Final Four, Syracui 
will lirst .match up again; 

Florida. These are two streaky I 

teams streaking their way P 

towards greatness, but Ihe journey I 

ends for Syracuse early m New I

the ugly stepchild of the NCAA

Who really cares who wins

royally screwed out of an

Mississippi State (S) and beat up

thankhilly, finally loses.
