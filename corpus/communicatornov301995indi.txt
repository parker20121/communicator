Studs Terkel discusses students' link to past 



by Nol It, ■ i.i. :. 
Editor 

In the third installment of The Omnibus 
Lecture Series. Pulitzer Prize winning 
author Studs Terkel spoke about our links 
lo the past in Walb Tuesday, 

"Not learning from the past can be detri- 
mental indeed," said Terkel He also said 
America suffers from a case of "National 



Alzheimers.' 

Terkel' s most recent book, "Coming of 
Age," documents the history of the last 
century of the second millennium with 
firsthand accounts of the people who lived 
it Writing the stories of those 70 years and 
older allowed Terkel to colorfully chronicle 
personal events related to the Depression. 
World War II, the Cold War and Senator 
Joe McCarthy's communist witch hunt. 



According to Terkel, the older genera- 
tion does not dislike today's generation; 
they pity them for their lack of a sense of 
history. 

During his speech, Terkel blamed 
McCanhyism for today's lack of thoughtful 
conversation and the 30-second sound bite 
which have contributed lo this generation's 
unawareness of history According lo 
Terkel. the threat of being labeled a com- 



munist is similar to being called a liberal 
today. 

Terkel also criticized today's politicians 
who decry the evils of big govemmeni. 

"Those same people who attack 'big 
guv'menf are the same ones whose fathers 
and grandfathers benefited from the 'New 
Deal.' " he said Terkel mentioned Ronald 
Reagan's father who benefited from FDR's 
WPA program as one example. 



Terkel graduated from the University of 
Chicago Law School in I934 and has host- 
ed "The Studs Terkel Show" on WFMT in 
Chicago for the last 41 years. Terkel 
received the Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for his 
book, "The Good War An Oral History of 
World War II." 

Terkel was introduced by IPFW alum- 
nist David Nichols. Nichols assisted Terkel 
in researching "The Good War "

by Rebecca Koenlg 
Chief Reporter 

This semester Follett's 
Bookstore has decided to try to 
give students a break by offering 
current software at prices lower 
than the recommended retail price 

Wilh modem technology, some 
tasks which previously would have 
been extremely difficult or impos- 
sible are made simple with the use 
of a compuier, Pollen's sells some 
computer software. This software 
is designed wilh practical applica- 
tions and is almost essential to sur- 
vive college All students have 
access to ample software by using 
the university computer labs Now 



Follett's has made it affordable for 
students to own some of these soft- 
ware packages for their home com- 
puters 

Follett's is currently selling five 
software packages at the reduced 
cost. Perfect Office is a collection 
of several other programs, includ- 
ing WordPerfect and QuattraPro 
Currcndy this package can be pur- 
chased for $25.50 at the bookstore

IPFW students through an agree- 
ment with Novell software. IPFW

University leaps into the cyber age 



by Melissa Young-Flores 
News Editor 



Since the beginning of the semester, 
IPFW siudents have been able to 
surf the Internet from all campus 
open-access labs, Although each 
student will not have access to an individ- 
ual e-mail account until next semester. User 
Support Manager Mary Schocler said slu-

dents are unaware of the new technology to 

which they already have access. 

Netscape, which replaced Mosaic as ihe 

foremost client or the World Wide Web 

(WWW), is the software used by all of ihe 

IPFW open-access labs. 

Schoeler said Netscape is probably the 

best WEB browser for students, as it offers 

them the opportunity to surf almost any site 

on the net 

Currently all the labs contain computers 
capable of handling the graphi- 
cal elements of the Internet that 
help facilitate student learning. 
except Kettler 204, said 
Schoeler. 

Kettler 204 contains 
VAX terminals which have 
allowed students at the request 
of their professor or instructor 
to obtain an e-mail account. The 
terminals have neither a hard 
drive nor a disk drive and arc 
incapable of visualizing graph- 
ics; however, the Internet can 
still be accessed from the termi- 
nals, but only in text form. 

Previously the computers 
in three other labs were not able 
to access the Internet. Now with 
the new Technology Fee. they 
have been upgraded to become 
fully capable. 

Scbocler said despite the 
updates already completed and 
the ones planned for the future. 
the VAX terminals will proba- 



bly remain intact for quite some tune. She 
said until e-mail becomes available for all 
students, those requiring e-mail can contin- 
ue to use VAX The current charge for the 
account will no longer be applied due to the 
Unified Academic Fee According to 
Schoeler. even though students now have 
access to the world-wide service for 
research, it is very difficult for them lo try 
to sort through the tangled web withoul 
guidance, 

"There is just so much information out 
there. Once students learn to use Netscape, 
it is easy." said Cliff Hill, senior and com- 
puter help desk consultant. "A lot of times 
there may be places you do not know 
about." 

Currently, IPFW students are not 
required to take a compuier literacy class 
According to Schoeler. the lack of comput- 
er education makes it difficult for students 
lo find their way around the Internet or 
even on the computer's hardrive. She said it 
is frustrating to see students leave the uni- 
versity expecting to teach the next genera- 
lion lo be compuier proficient when they 
are struggling themselves. 

Most of the difficulties arise from lack 
of manpower. Schoeler said the department 
car) barely keep up with and maintain the 
growing technology with Ihe current staff 
and cannot possibly instruct the entire cam- 
pus in computer literacy. 

A combined effort on the part of the 
teaching staff and the implementors of the 
technology is necessary lo combat the prob- 
lem. Ii may be necessary to require a com- 



puter literacy course, according (o 
Schoeler. 

The concept of billions of computers 
being linked together from all over the 
world is still unimaginable to some, but 



als such as hardware and software. They 
may not be used for personnel, even if the 
addilional people would be used to imple- 
menl and maintain the university's growing 
technology, according to Norm Newell, 




The VAX sites currenily provide e-mail access for students at their professor's 
request.

the Internet identifies you so that 
people can send you mail, It usual- 
ly looks like usemame@ hostname

name, or login name, or account 
number; and hostname is the 
Internet's name for ihe computer or 
Internet provider you use. The 
hostname can be a few words 
strum; together with periods. The 
official Internet for Dummies 
address, for example, is 
internct@dummics.com. because 
its uscmamc is internet and it is on 
a computer named dummics.com. *

is also the name of a program that 
uses the protocol to transfer files

you usually telnet to a Gopher 
server and begin browsing the

bunch of networks, including net- 
works in all pans of the world.* 
Listserv — A family of programs 



that automatically manage mailing

for our purposes, we are talking 
about lots of computers that arc 
connected together. Those in the

"Of course all of the technology 
fee money is already spent for this 
year (even the pari we haven't got- 
ten yet)," said Newell in ihe 
December issue of Info Share 
"The most immediate effect has 
been the replacement of older 
equipment with current technology: 
56 of 137 open-access machines 
updated to Pentiums; printing capa- 
bilities in all open labs improved 
by placing dot matrix printers with 
networked laser printers; new soft- 
ware menus to facilitate usage; and

for all students." 

Newell said he agrees that the 
computer and data processing 
department needs additional help to 
keep up He said, however, the 
funds would have to come from 
elsewhere and funding is already 
tight. 

"The Internet is the catch-all 
word used to describe the massive 
world-wide network of computcrs. 
The word ■internet' literally means 
'network of networks' In itself, the 
Internet is compromised of thou- 
sands of smaller regional networks 
scattered throughout the globe," 
said Kevin Hughes, in his on-line 
publication Entering (he World- 
Wide Web: A Guide to 
Cyberspace. "On any given day it 
connects roughly 15 million users 
in over 50 

"The fact that the Internet is not 
just one thing, but several different 
tools for acquiring and sending 
information, definitely muddies the 
educational waters," said Joseph

Hill said, although the Internet 
may be a useful tool for research, 
students must be very careful when 
determining which sources are 
accurate because the Internet is set 
up so that anyone can exchange

Local athlete strives for the 1996 Olympic gold medal 



by Rebecca Koenig 
Chief Reporter 

Dee Dee Nathan, a Fort Wayne native, may get to 
see the Olympic Games from a unique perspective. 
The South Side graduate recently held a fundraiser to 
help raise the needed funds to travel to the games. 

Nathan is hoping to qualify for the Heptatbalon in 
the upcoming Olympic games in 
Atlanta, Georgia. She has been 
running since junior high. She 
attended high school at South Side 
where she set many track records. 
According to one of her class- 
mates, Joy Zirile. she is still 
remembered for her athletic abili- 
ties now. ten years later. 

Nathan ran track for Indiana 
University, where she attended col- 
lege. After graduation the coach 
encouraged her to continue train- 
ing and run in a race which could 
possibly qualify her for the 
Olympics. In the 1992 qualifying 
race. Nathan was pleasantly sur- 
prised to come in fourth place, two 
seconds behind the third-place run- 
ner. The first three people quali- 
fied for the Olympics, Dee Dee 
was the runner up. 

When planning for their ten 
year class reunion, some of 
Nathan's class members rediscov- 
ered her success Wanting to help 
her achieve her goal, they began 
plans for a fundraiser, which was 
held on Saturday, November 25, at 
Science Central. They hoped to 



raise ten thousand dollars. While the exact amount 
collected is not yet known, Zirile estimated they raised 
around four or five thousand dollars. Nathan would 
like to slop working soon so she can train full time.

by Paul Tupp«r assistant interim vice chancellor of sociology and anthropology. 

m ..ti &gt;, ii n: i.i.i. academic affairs two weeks ago. Dilorio has been recruited to assist 

Temporarily leaving her previous Interim Vice Chancellor of 

Judith Dilorio was appointed position of associate professor of Academic Affairs Doug Townsend 

In addition to assisting 
Townsend. Dilorio will attend vari- 
ous committee meetings Townsend 
is unable to attend, help search for 
a new Dean of Arts and Sciences. 
and serve on the Diversity Council. 

Dilorio's temporary position 
will expire on June 30.1996, partly 
because of her request. 

"When a permanent Vice 
Chancellor is found, I want to give 
them a chance to find an assistant 
that best suits them, not feel stuck 
with me." said Dilorio. 

Fred Kirchoff, former interim 
vice chancellor of academic affairs, 
left the university last year for a 
position in Minnesota The search 
for his replacement continues and 
Dilorio said she is not sure bow 
close the administration is to com- 
pleting their search. 

"Many who come to IPFW to 
administration see it as a stepping 
stone in their careers." said 
Dilorio 

Dilorio is aware that many 
believe she was promoted to stifle 
the cries for a more diverse confer- 
ence. She said she believes a 
woman was in mind for the posi- 
tion.

To the editor 

I am writing in regards lo Philip 
Marks's article. "Is there life oul 
there? If so. show me." Well 
Philip, I'm going to show you 

True. IPFW is not as big and 
exciting as other campuses. And 
ime, it doesn't have thai "college 
life" atmosphere. However, in 
order to have a good time and 
enjoy your college years ai IPFW 
you need io get involved in the 
organizations that are available 
around you 

I am a member of Delta Gamma 
Fraternity. Many students on this 
campus are unaware of lhe social 
men and women's fraternities on 
IPFW's campus. There is always 
something to do on the weekends, 
other than going to the bars and we 
have a suite in Walb which makes 
between classes and lunch time 
something more than bonng This 
is just one way of getting involved. 

As for your proposal of getting 
an activities committee — HELLO 



Philip - what is S.A.B. Student 
Activities Board? This board does 
more than its share of providing 
students with activities on campus. 
I am one of ibe few students wbo 
attends many of their events, which 
are usually free. If you're not 
happy with what ihey bring (o cam- 
pus them why not gel involved and 
become a member of SAB and 
put your two cents in. 

The only problem on this cam- 
pus is the students like yourself 
with no knowledge of what IPFW 
has to offer its students or just too 
lazy (o get involved, bul find time 
to complain about it. Philip and the 
rest of you who think IPFW is 
"boring," ibere is 70 organizations 
available on this campus lo be 
involved in. So my proposal if for 
you to slop complaining and get 
involved

ii writing in regard (o lhe col-

Tupper. Each week Paul informs 
lhe students and faculty al IPFW 
about gays and the gay community 
He also writes of tips for gays to 
use to improve their lives. Thai is 
fine if he wants to help people, but 
the Communicator is not lhe place

1 know a lot of people, myself 
included, thai do not care about 
what is going on in the gay commu- 
nity or Paul's survival tips Tupper 
writes aboul problems that gays 
face in everyday life. The purpose 
of this I guess is io help gay people 
deal with the problems, and let 
straight people know what they're 
going through. Well Paul, everyone 
has problems, but we do not get an 
article to write aboul them I do not 



see the importance of why you 
must inform IPFW each week of 
the problems gay people go 
through. 

The space used each week in the

To the editor. 

Some of lhe guys in the band 
Pop and Fresh are students here, so 
I suppose this may be an appropri- 
ate forum for what I want to say. 
I'm with Cool Blue and the 
Attitude and I'm a sludeni here as 
well. 

Today I say in lhe paper lhai 
Pop and Fresh lost their keyboard 
player, Pete Smilb, who passed 
away at the age of forty-five. I only 



mei Pete once, at a jam session at 
Tilley's. We made eye contact an 
took off logeiher, he on his key- 
board and I on my hom When the 
set ended he came over, grinned 
and shook my hand. 'Thanks, man" 
was all he said. 

The world of an has been both 
kind and cruel. I can'l go into the 
ins and outs here, but il's one of the 
reasons why, ai forty-seven. I am a 
college sludeni trying io learn 
math I've played music most of 



my life. Sometimes people cheered, 
and sometimes they just walked 
oul. Sometimes they liked it, and 
sometimes they didn't. But nobody 
ever thanked me. 

So I say to Pop and Fresh: sorry, 
lads. You're all good enough to fill 
the gap, but the music will always 
be different, noi the same And you 
know what I mean by thai. And 
bey. Pete... Thanks, man.

deciding what to do about the lack 
of reiemion, ask us! For example, 
Rhcba's strength and supponivc- 
ness inside and outside her class- 
room for her students is what a 
strong retention rate is all about 
Crying aboul losing minority stu- 
dents in an atmosphere that is non- 
supportive is like crying wolf, when 
the answer is as simple as keeping a 
caring instructor like Rheba with 
whom students of color can relate. 

Last spring. I was having a prob- 
lem wilh a public agency 1 went to 
Rheba for some advice because I 
knew she would understand. I did 
not have a class with her that 
semester She took ber limited ume 
and willingly listened, gave me 
some advice, and asked me lo check 
back The rest of ihe semester, 
every time I saw her in the halls she 
would slop, tell me io hang in there, 
and ask me bow I was doing. Do 
you know what kind of effect thai

description Also, IPFW can elimi- 
nate counting part-time high school

fessors None of ihem fulfill the 
spirit of affirmative action for hir- 
ing tenure-track faculty from disad-

io me thai IPFW is on ihe road to 
future affirmative action lawsuits 
because of such neglect. 

Wouldn't it be better for IPFW

now instead of being forced through 
the courts later? We have Rheba

ability to communicate effectively 
to the diverse population IPFW is

Gay struggles vary

lo which he belongs I could talk 
for hours about the former, but the 
need is to emphasize the latter. 

You have io remember — and if 
you don't, feci free to come lo Ihe 
Communicator and look at old 
issues — thai I speak only for 
myself. 1 have not been asked by 
anyone to represeni any communi- 
ty, nor do I warn to. You should 
also know thai I am not a typical 
member of the gay community I 
have known that I was gay since I 
was a fetus I have been "active." 
for lack of a better term, in the gay 
community since I was eleven. I am 
at a much more advanced stage of 
my sense of being than many olher 
gays and lesbians. Il is those who 



arc nol as comfortable as 1 am lhai 1 
wntc to and for whom you should 
have compassion. 

Being gay is very hard. Some 
argue that you can hide u without 
an understanding of what that 



"Being gay is very 
hard. Some argue 
that you can hide 

it without an 
understanding of 
what that means. " 



means. There are protective laws 
that give all olber traditionally 
oppressed groups their rights, yei 
gays have none. This does noi end 
injustice, but it docs formally stale 
that injustice is wrong. No such 
statement is made by our govern- 
ment lo give gays lhat freedom. It is 
this injustice that has caused the 
current gay liberation movement. 

Being gay could mean losing 
your family. African Americans 
cannot say that. 

Being gay means you cannot 
marry your true love. Latino 



Americans cannot say thai. 

Being gay could mean your part- 
ner will not be protected by your 
company's medical insurance. 
Asian Americans cannot say thai. 

Being gay makes it very difficult 
to adopl children. Jewish 
Americans cannot say thai. 

With lhai said, I think the gay 
communily has a right (o "whine" 
all they need lo until these things 
are accomplished Bui before some- 
one can join this fight, they must be 
comfortable with their new life 
This lakes years of reading aboul 
homosexuality, learning thai you 
are not a freak, realizing thai only 
your true friends wiU suck by you, 
and entering the community at your 
own pace 

The point is. when you read ihis 
column, don't lei yourself think of 
me as every gay, because I'm nol. I 
have just seen a lot, done a lot. and 
experienced a lol. My primary goal 
is lo lessen the shock and help those 
who are not as "out" as I am. 
Coming to terms wilh your gayncss 
is like walking inio a completely 
dark room You don't know what's 
ihere or what io expect If I, or any- 
one else, can shine a light into that 
room...

To the editor; 

This letter is in regard to the article 
"Holiday Hell" by Paul Tuppcr. one of his 
"Gay-ly" complaints. I don't understand why 
Mr. Tupper must constantly defend the so 
called "gay community." If people cannot 
respect and listen to you for who you are. 
then they are narrow minded and are at a 
loss! 

I do not have any problems with those 
individuals who are gay. though I 'choose to 
dale my opposite I also do not believe that 
the gay community should run around whin- 
ing about how they don't receive respect. 1 
have grown up to learn that those who are 
the greatest achievers in life must at all times 
stand alone. That is, take control of your life, 
live it how your please, but within proper 
doings. 

Sure, problems will arise in society about 
your sexual choice, but our joumey though 
life cannot please everyone. And yes. limes 
will be hard when dealing with family mem- 
bers who cannot break away from old think- 
ing; amazingly enough, both sides learn from 
the feuds. 
Remember, you're 
in control of your- 
self — not friends 
and family. 

These turbulent 
times in life do not 
call for PLOM (poor 
little old me) atti- 
tudes. Drop the 
"Please feel sorry 
for me, I'm not 
receiving respect" 
way of thinking. 

A few people I 
know are gay, and 
struggle with family 
and friends who are 
closed minded and 
haven't accepted the 
fact that they're liv- 
ing in the *90's. 
Must I add that they 
also have friends 
who respect them 
for who they are. 

The difference 



between "Gay-ly Forward" and those whom 
I am friends with is thai whining about not 
being heard is noi a pari of their everyday 
living It's your decision.

French farce entertains audience 



by Amanda Manlon 
SUIT Writer 

Camlllc tears through the door-

shows, "I oc a! I oe a!" Translation: 
"I've gone mad! I've gone mad!"

the four 1995-96 Mainstage 
Productions, ran Nov. 17, 18, 24, 
and 25. 

The French farce, written by 
Georges Fcydeau, takes the audi- 
ence on a playful romp into a man- 
trap gone awry, complete with illicit 
liaisons, a case of mistaken identi- 
ty, a French maid, and a crazy 
Spaniard 

Raymonde. played by actress 
Nancy Karrool!. suspects her hus- 
band Chandeblse (actor Tommy 
D'annuzio) of having an affair 
because of a slight problem: impo- 
tence. Raymonde and her friend 



Lucienne. played by 
Heidi Warfel, concoct a 
trap for Chandebise. The 
two Victorian ladies 
compose a faux love let- 
ter, addressed to 
Chandebise, in 

Lucienne's hand; then, 
the plot begins to take 
some kinky turns and 
twists. 

Chandebise receives 
the letter and decides 
that bis secret admirer 
has mistaken him for bis 
friend Toumel He sends 
Touinel instead to tbe 
Golden Cock Hotel for a 
rendezvous, where 
Raymonde is waiting, 
expecting to see her hus- 
band. To complicate 
matters more. 

Chandebise shows the 
letter to Homcnides.

who flies into a jealous 
rage. Tbe crazy Spaniard

to shoot anyone who ge 




often finding themselves 
in precarious positions, 
and tear through the 
audience, up and down 
stairs in heated pursuit. 

Farces are one of 
the most difficult types 
of plays to produce 
Actors and actresses 
must show a great 
amount of discipline on 
the stage. If the players 
show anticipation of a 
joke or react to it too far 
in advance, the audience 
will become bored,

This weekend, "Kids," one of 
the most controversial films of the

Clark's film, because of its con-

J ~ with Gotham 

Of the Cinema'S Entertainment 

QOal." Group is host- 

W ing a discussion 

of the film after 



"Playing 

controversial films 

that otherwise 



holds-barred picture 
of 24 hours in mod- 
ern-day inner-city 
adolescent life. The 
film, which is filled 
with scenes of drug 
use, violence and 
sex involving characters as young 
as 14 years old, was slapped with a 
NC-17 rating. "Kids" never made it 
to Fort Wayne area cinemas during 
its national release because many 
theater chains would not pick up tbe 
film due to its NC-17 rating. 

The screenplay's language, writ- 
ten in three weeks by 
Harmony Korine at 
age 19, is stark and 
brutally truthful. 
Teenagers throw 
around powerful 
words, usually found 
falling from the lips 
of Mafia thugs in a 
Quentin Tarentino 
production, as easily 
as they throw tbe basketball. Telly, 
one of the main characters, spends 
bis nights attempting to deflower 
the young virgins of New York 
City — his version of safe sex, 
which leads to tbe infection of a 
young girl with HIV. 

"Nowadays, the relationships 
between boys and girls are so dif- 
ferent. Everything is out in tbe 
open. All the language is out here. 
There's all of this exchange, sexual- 
ly-explicit language which may 
sound shocking to the older genera- 
tion, but it's just frieodly banter 
between boys and girls, a kind of 
interaction that's perfectly natural 
and normal for kids today," says 
Clark. 

Wherever it goes, "Kids" seems 
to bring controversy along with it. 
Lee expects to find a few letters to 
the editor in the newspapers about 
the showing from concerned com- 
munity members. Critics of the film 
and members of different communi- 
ties think that children who go to 
see the film will attempt to emulate 
the scenes they watch on the screen, 
according to Lee. 

Playing controversial films that 
otherwise would not reach tbe Fort 
Wayne community is part of the 
cinema's goal 

" 'Kids' is not a film for every- 
one. It is a bleak movie, and we 
want to give every warning we can

Must women look like models 
to have self -worth? 



by Alsba La Roc he 
Staff Writer 

Almost every woman bas an 
"I'll wear this again someday" out- 
fit. It's the outfit thrown way in the 
back of the closet, bidden under 
dozens of pairs of stretchies and 
sweat pants. It used to be your 
favorite, but after ten extra pounds, 
it looks better on the hanger than it 
does on you. 

So you swear that you're going 
on a diet. No more sour cream pota- 
to chips or soda. No more extra but- 
ter on your popcorn at the movies. 
You bave vowed to be a new 
woman. 

With women like Cindy 
Crawford and Naomi Campbell 
plastered all over billboards, TV 
and popular magazines, it can be 
difficult to accept yourself just tbe 
way you are 

Of course you can purchase the 
thigh-master or tbe abdominal 
stomach cruncher with just three 
easy payments of $14 .95 each. 
With dedication and a workout con- 
sisting of just ten minutes a day, 
you too can accomplish physical 
perfection. Look out, Suzanne 
Sommcrs, I am squeezing and 
crunching 

Yet, isn't there a problem with 
women feeling like they must look 
like magazine covers to have any 
self-worth? The ideal woman, if 
you go by the standard of Barbie, 
would be six feet tall and weigh 
120 pounds. What about the rest of 
us? What about all the young girls 



who never will look like Barbie? 

Women, beautiful educated 
women, come in all shapes and 
sizes. Women can be unique and 
exotic in mind and body. It doesn't 
lake a death-wish-diet to accom- 
plish self- worth. 

Every woman needs to find 
something in herself that makes her 
unique. It might be that your eye- 
lashes curl without mascara or that 
your feet look great with a splash of 
red polish. Whatever it may be. 
every woman holds a secret that 
allows her to be special and beauti- 
ful.

Professor works for peace 



by Janet Tobcy 
Feature* Editor 

As a freshman at Cornell 
University in I960, Richard 
Johnson took pan in a staged faint- 
out during ROTC drills. The 
demonstration was to protest com- 
pulsory ROTC service in land-grant 
colleges. 

A third of the youths were pulled 
off the field, creating a Swiss- 
cheese-like mess, said Johnson. 

'They were radicals, but I didn't 
know it then," said Johnson. "They 
got me involved in the peace move- 
ment. I was booked because it 
worked." 

Governor Nelson Rockefeller, 
who was speaking during the faint- 
out, afterward abolished the com- 
pulsory ROTC. 

Johnson, now associate professor 
of German in modem foreign lan- 
guages, has been an activist in the 
cause of peace since then. He is the 
director of IPFW's Peace and 
Conflict Studies program, which be 
co-founded in 1989. 

Johnson teaches a course this 
spring called "Film for the 
Common Good." The class covers 
topics such as the Civil Rights 
Movement, Ghandi's work, and 
altruism in Nazi Europe. 

"The focus of the course is to 
find the common good and praise 



it," said Johnson. "We 
look at success stories 
and find out bow 
human beings can 
prevail over vio- 
lence" 

Johnson's 
approach is solution- 
one n led, 

"Everybody in this 
country has been 
affected on some 
level by racism, sex- 
ism or classism," said 
Johnson. "We need to 
look at conflict to find 
its causes and then 
once we find the caus- 
es, we work together 
to find the solution." 

According to 
Johnson, violence in 
the world is getting 
better and worse. 

"The truth is thai 
the rules of the world 
are based on violence. 
An enormous amount 
of the U.S. budget goes for war- 
making, much more than for peace- 
making," said Johnson. 

At tbc same time, there is hope 
for the future. One sign of progres- 
sion, he said, is the existence of 
peace studies on college campuses 

"When I was young, one didn't 
have tbe option of learning about 




Richard Johnson, associate professor of German in modem foreign languages, is direclor of 
IPFW's Peace and Conflict program 



these things, and now you can. That 
is real," said Johnson. "There are 
more groups working for a better 
world now." 

In the nation. there arc now 230 
programs in peace, be said. 

IPFW's Peace and Conflict 
Studies program is the first within 
Indiana or Purdue University sys- 
tems. 



"The program gives you a better 
handle on how to deal with the 
world, and how to deal with con- 
flict, whether it is happening on (he 
interpersonal level or on the group 
level," said Johnson. 

IPFW's program is the first in 
any of the RJ or Purdue campuses 
to provide a certificate, which a stu- 
dent obtains upon the completion of 



15 credit hours, 
including the intro- 
ductory course and a 
senior project. 

Johnson also co- 
founded The Center 
for Non-Violence in 
Fort Wayne, in 
1980 The Center 
provides a women's 
shelter, youth pro- 
grams, and counsel- 
ing. 

The Center, 
which Johnson said 
sprang from a desire 
to do something 
practical to create a 
better world, is the 
third program in die 
country to do peer 
counseling for men 
who have physically 
abused others. 

Johnson, who is 
Chair of tbe 
Diversity Council at 
IPFW, has devoted 
bis life to searching for practical 
solutions to violence and conflict 
He said he feels teaching is one 
important way for him to do his 
work. 

"I try to impart to students that 
they are capable of learning about 
the world and transforming it," said 
Johnson. "My goal is to help stu- 



dents better understand tbe world 
and to become better citizens. My 
reward is seeing this happen." 

After receiving his Ph.D. from 
Harvard University in 1968, 
Johnson taught at Indiana 
University at Bloomingion 
Although he liked several things 
about the campus, he decided that 
being a faculty member at IPFW 
would allow him to place more 
emphasis upon teaching. 

"I see myself primarily as a 
teacher who docs research, not as a 
researcher who teaches on the 
side," said Johnson. 

Currently he is doing research on 
Ghandi, along with senior Eric 
Lcdbetter. 

They are looking at Ghandi's life 
work in which he sought to bring 
politics and religion together in a 
healthy way, and are researching 
bis efforts to find the underlying 
thread beneath all rebgions. 

One concept that they are work- 
ing with is the belief that violence 
results from a failure to recognize 
that all human life is inseparable, 
and that the key to conflict resolu- 
tion is finding common ground. 

"Ghandi said that if you do not 
know why people are acting a cer- 
tain way," said Johnson, "look into 
your own heart." 



Psychedelic meets 
orchestral in Floyd 



tribute 



by Nol Beckley 
Editor 

Throughout most of American 
radioland, you can't swing a dead 
cat without bitting a Pink Floyd 
song From the time most of us 
were weaned, our folks were deeply 
entrenched in (be psychedelic 
sounds of Waters, Gilmour. Wright, 
Mason and Barrett. 

"Us and Them: Symphonic Pink 
Floyd" is a valiant attempt to recap- 
ture tbe originality and etheric feel 
of some of Floyd's more popular 
songs. The CD, recorded by the 
London Symphony Orchestra, fea- 
tures six cuts from "The Dark Side 
of the Moon" (Time, Brain 
Damage, Breathe, Money, Tbe 
Great Gig in the Sky and Us and 
Them) and three songs from "The 
Wall" (Brick in the Wall [Pan II]. 
Comfortably Numb and Nobody 
Home) 

Producer Youth and arranger Jaz 
Coleman used the orchestral medi- 
um to "demonstrate that music once 
catagorised [sic] as 'progressive' by 
one generation is now considered 
undeniably 'classic' by another 
generation," wrote Coleman 

With great trepidation I 
approached this tribute and hoped I 
would not be inundated with the 
same sounds I have heard for 20 
years I was worried that I would 
have to suffer through more than 60 
minutes of rehashed music by a for- 
mer innovative band who used a 
cheap battery-powered gimmick to 
sell their last release 

Fortunately I was not too disap- 
pointed. Both Colemcn's arrange- 
ment and Youth's production added 
something different and fresh to 
Floyd's overplayed music. 
Coleman has created a lively inter- 
pretation of Floyd's original sound 
without losing die etheric quality 
which had become a hallmark of 
Pink Floyd 

The first cut. Time, is the weak- 
est and stays closest to the original 
arrangement, but the rest of the CD 
consumes the mind. Tbe greatest 
strength of this CD Is the instru- 
mentation of Water's voice. 
Various instruments are used by 
conductor Peter Scboles to achieve 
this quality. "Nobody Home" is 
arranged as a violin concerto with a 
solo Arabic violin replacing the 
vocal line The violin is masterfully 
played by Aboud Abdel Al 
Stephen Small adds his piano skills 
to "Nobody Home." 

Other artists appearing on this 



CD are B.J. Cole playing pedal 
steel guitar on "Breathe" and 
Gilbert Bibcrian playing acoustic 
guitar on "Comfortably Numb." 

Another feature to this CD is 
artistry on the cover and in the liner 
notes. Roger Dean's "Dragon's 
Garden" graces the cover (too bad 
vinyl albums are no longer in 
vogue). The cover an gives this CD 
a Tolkien-like aura. Equally as 
majestic is the artistry within die 
liner notes. 

For those who have been over- 
saturated with Pink Floyd, this CD 
may be worth a listen, but 
for the Pink purists this 
may be too much of an 
abomination for their ears 



IPFW now Has film club 



by Andrew Yoder 
StafT Writer 

Halfway through its first year as 
a full-fledged club on campus, the 
IPFW Film Club is growing and 
expanding with increased member- 
ship and interest. 

The IPFW Film Club began 
unofficially in the fall of 1994 when 
Lisa Bartels distributed flyers 
around campus advertising the first 
meeting of the new organization. 
The flyers were subsequently taken 
down by a member of the university 
staff as it was not an "official" club. 

Bartels enlisted the help of two 
IPFW professors, Steve Carr and 
Mike Kaufmann, who were instru- 
mental in changing the status of the 
film club from a renegade group of 
students into a formally recognized 
organization. 

The group, which meels every 
two weeks in Room 204 of the Fine I 



Arts Building, is a close-knit group 
whose common denominator is 
film. 

Club members, said Banels, like 
to engage in lively discussions 
about the films and frequently go 
out as a group alter the showings. 
The group consists of students with 
majors such as film and communi- 
cations. 



There are no fees to join the 
club. Membership is open to any- 
one who enjoys watching, dis- 
cussing or even making film. 

Bartels said she wants the Film 
Club to move toward the production 
aspect of film. Proposed fundraisers 
may also fund a trip to a film festi- 
val in Chicago. Fundraisers would 
include bringing films such as the 



"Rocky Horror Picture Show" and 
Pink Floyd's "The Wall" to area 
cinemas.

'Cats Big 10 champs 
'dream' season 




Clad in a gaudy outfit of purple and 
while. I prepared 10 pay witness lo 
a duel thai would ultimately decide 
the fate of nol only an upstart colle- 
giate football team from Evanston, 
III,, but also my own destiny. 1 was 
ready. 

For nearly three hours I 
observed (bis gridiron figbt. 
Moaning and groaning with each 
play that went against me (and the 
maize and blue), celebrating with 
each play that went in my favor. It 
was an emotional roller coaster. 

At the beginning of the 1995 
college football season, the 
Northwestern Wildcats were picked 
by the "experts" to finish dead last 
in the Big 10 -er 1 1- Conference 
The gambling men in Las Vegas 
tabbed them as a 1.000,000-to-l 
long-shot to win the conference 
championship. Then, for 11 weeks 
the team lhat historically has 
played the role of conference door- 
mat, rose to each occasion. After 
the dismantling of Notre Dame, 
everyone called it a fluke. They 
consequently ruined an unbeaten 
season by losing to Miami 
University of Ohio. Eyebrows 
raised, "I told you so's" echoed 
throughout the nation. I remained a 
be U ever 

Next, the underdog turned to 
hero as the Wildcats entered the 
"Big House," the same location as 
the aforementioned party, and 
defeated a much favored Wolverine 
squad. "Maybe they are for real," 
was whispered through all of col- 
lege football. The Las Vegas odds 
dropped to 100-to-l. Lee Corso, the 
former Indiana University head- 
coach and now ESPN analyst, 
became a believer for one game. I 
remained a belie ver. 

In the end I danced like the court 
jester as I celebrated a most unlike- 
ly, once-in a-life-time victory. I cel- 
ebrated not for the men or the 
school we have come (o know as 
the Wolverines. No, I celebrated for 
myself, my merriment was self- 
centcred. though I did remember 



the group of guys who must have 
been raising a cheer of thanks to 
the University of Michigan 
well. For once, the ever-lasting 
underdog was triumphant. A school 
accustomed to ridicule and snicker 
ing had risen above the rest, proven 
(he so-called experts wrong and 
(banks to their perseverance, I 
became a millionaire 

Wow, my head certainly ached 
after the merriment that followed 
the party. I rolled over to wake 
in the same room as alwa 
Looked out to the same world as I 
had for 28 years. I moaned in dis- 
gust. The memories from the day 
before began surfacing in my mind. 
A broad smile creased my sleep- 
wrinkled face. I ran lo the door for 
the morning newspaper. 

Opening (he morning Gazeue, I 
swiftly scanned the pages for the 
sports page. There, gracing the 
cover was a full-page pichire of (he 
celebration, (he merriment I had 
paid witness to less than 12 hours 
earlier. My smile grew. I remained 
a believer. 

With the echoes of the previous 
night's activity still ringing in my 
head, a slartling rap came (o the 
door. I sprang to my feet to see 
what was the matter, And then, it 
all hit me like a bull-rushing line- 
backer, As 1 slood at the foot of my 
bed, still worn by the night's sleep, 
I realized I was not a believer. I 
was nol dancing like (he court 
jester in merriment. Unfortunately I 
was not a millionaire It was all a 
dream. 

As I slowly shuffled to the door 
for the morning news, a tear inched 
down my cheek I opened the 
Gazette I hurriedly flipped the 
pages to the sports section. There, 
in glorious color was the celebra- 
tion. The same celebration I bad 
paid witness to in my mind's eye 
just moments before as 1 lay in my 
bed. It was true, Michigan bad 
paid a favor to the Northwestern 
Wildcats. The Wolverines had 
defeated Ohio Slate and ruined the 
Buckeye's run at a national cham- 
pionship. The Wildcats had risen to 
another occasion and come out the 
winner. Againsi all odds, 
1,000.000-to-l to be exact, the 
proverbial doormat had proven the 
"experts" wrong. But in all of my 
believing, 1 had not wagered a bet 
in their favor. I sat on my hands 
and played the game from the side- 
lines. A selfish feeling of remorse 
filled my heart, another tear rolled 
gently down my cheek. And I 
remembered... the view from under 
the bleachers depends on your point 
of view. 



Opening up the 1995-96 season 
with three consecutive loses is not 
the way any coach would like to 
start. After losing the first three 
games of the season, Andy Piazza, 
men's basketball head coach, is 
looking for answers. With junior 
center Ryan Bond out, due to a 
severe ankle injury, the solution has 
nol been to go inside againsi oppo- 
nents. Then again, the outside shots 
are nol falling cither. 

The 'Dons began the regular sea- 
son by taking a shellacking ai the 
hands of the St. Francis Cougars. 



The 'Dons struggled in the 89-71 
loss at the Gales Center. Senior 
K.C. Runyan led the team with 20 
points Three additional players fin- 
ished wilh double-figures in scoring 
for the Mastodons. Ryan Glidden 
added 13 points and Kyle Kirby and 
Derek Miller each chipped in 10 
points. 

Against Grace College, ihe 
"Dons fared no betler as they 
dropped a heartbreaker to Ihe 
Lancers. After controlling Ihe game 
for much of Ihe first and second 
halves, the Mastodons allowed a 



16-point lead lo slip away in the 
waning moments. A last-second, 
leaning jumpshot by the Lancers' 
Andy Schmidt won the game for 
Grace. 

Kirby bit on 10 of 11 shots for 
21 points and a team-leading five 
rebounds Miller added 18 points 
and Runyan finished with 14 points. 
Grace College was led by Darren 
Gaston who poured in 23 points, 
and Schmidt added 21 points. 

A 98-73 loss 10 number seven 
ranked Northern Kentucky may 
have been the high point thus far for 



the Mastodons. Although the final 
score saw the 'Dons lose their third 
straight contest, the team played 
with a raised intensity and appeared 
much more focused Kirby tickled 
the nets for a career-high 31 points 
Miller added 15 points, and junior 
Ryan Glidden chipped in 14 points 
The Norse were led by A1I- 
American candidate LaRon Moore 
who tallied 21 points and Shannon 
Minor who scored 20 points. 

The men's team expects to earn 
its first win of the season tonight as 
they hosi Sue Bennett College. 



The women's basketball team 
has been fast out of the chute, win- 
ning their first two games in con- 
vincing fashion. At the Edinboro 



Classic Tournament in Edinboro, 
Penn.. the Mastodons ran past the 
hosi learn, 106-90, Head Coach 
Pam Bowden said that going into 




the loumey she was skeptical of her 
team's chances. Against the 
Fighting Scots of Edinboro College, 
the 'Dons shot an impressive 53 
percent from the floor and 75 per- 
cent from the charity stripe. 

Senior AIl-American Lindy 
Jones led the team with 35 points 
while three other players finished in 
double figures. Jennie Newhard 
added 19 points while grabbing a 
team-high 10 rebounds. Leah 
Sheets followed wilh 17 points, and 
Barb Derry chipped in with 12 
points. 

In ihe championship game of the 
tournament, Jones again led the 



team as she poured in 29 points and 
grabbed 10 rebounds. The 'Dons 
defeated Shippensburg State, 98-87. 
Leah Sheets proved a vital part of 
ihe win, as she added 19 points and 
a career-high 15 rebounds Wendy 
Recker and freshman Jessica Henry 
each tallied 10 points, and Newhard 
garnered 11 points. 

The 'Dons were well represented 
on the All-Tournament team as both 
Jones and Sheets were selected with 
the honor. 

The women's team currently 
holds a 2-0 record, averaging 102 
poinls per contest while limiting 
opponenis to 88.5 points.

Women to host 
Summit City 
shoot-out 




experience for us lo be on the road. 
We need to condition ourselves 
mentally to be able to do the things 
we need to do in order to win. 
What we are hoping is 10 learn lo 
win on the road and to be success- 
ful," said Bowden 

After an admirable premier in 
Edinboro, ii looks as if maybe this 
year's women's basketball team is 
learning those lessons rather quick- 
ly 

"I am very pleased with where 
we are at now, We just need to stay 
together as a team and keep the 
intensity up. 1 think that this team 
can have a very good year without 
injuncs-knock on wood- if we keep 
our team perspective. The kids 
really wanted to prove something 
lo us and they did. I am just very 
pleased." said Bowden.

Room... 

with Jeff Jackson 



A good crop of talent will 
invade the Gates Sports Center this 
weekend as the women's basketball 
learn hosts Ihe Summit City Sboot- 
Oui. Originally, ihe evenl was 
scheduled as a tournament but a 
conflict in scheduling has forced 
ihe malch-up lo ail invitational for- 
mal 

"I am a IKUe disappointed in that 
fact, bui whatever we have 10 do in 
the way of eligibility is all lhat we 
can do," said Head Coach Pam 
Bowden. 

The Shoot-Out will see Marian 
College. Wayne State and the 
College of SL Francis, 111., playing 
at Ihe Gales Sports Center. 

Although the competition will 
not be of Ihe same caliber the 
'Dons will face in conference play, 
Bowden says that inter-conference 
games arc a good way to gauge 
where hot team sits both physically 
and mentally. 

"We are hoping 10 come out 
with two wins. What we need to do 
is stay focused and accomplish the 
things we need to in order to play 
out game." said Bowden. 

The ihing the Mastodons have 
done well Ihus far is score points. 
Afier winning the I.dmboro Classic 
by an average of nearly 18 points, 
it is not putting the baskelball into 
the hoop lhai worries Bowden. 

"We -i ill need some work on the 
defensive end, and our advantage 
in rebounding needs lo continue," 
she said. 

After opening ihe season wilh 
four games on the road, the going 
geis no easier for ihe 'Dons 
Playing five games in a span of 
eighi days will lest Ihe team's 
physical and mental endurance. 
Prior lo the Summit City Shoot- 
Out, ihe Mastodons travel lo 
Northwood and Tri-State. Wins in 
either or both of ihose contests 
should add j loi of confidence to an 
already growing conviction. 

"1 think that they are ready to 
play at home but it has been a good 




For junior Jeff Jackson the name 
of the game is tempo and intensity 
As a co-captain and the starting 
point guard on the men's basketball 
team, Jackson (aka J.J.) sees his 
role as that of a playmakcr and con- 
troller on the court Off the court 
he says ihe team has enough chem- 
istry to know what to expect from 
one another and lhat allows him to 
concentrate on other matters. 

"My role is lo make sure 1 set 
Ihe tempo for the game. When we 
are down, it is my job to lift them 
up. When we get out of control, I 
need lo be able to keep everyone in 
focus," explained Jackson 

It is a role Jackson assumed 
prior to the season in his own mind. 
He set out to prove his worth and 
capabilities during the off-season 
The confidence Head Coach Andy 
Piazza has shown in him is only 
icing on the cake. 

"It was nothing coach did or did 
noi do," said Jackson when asked 
about his new-found level of inten-

earlier in the season that he was 
surprised by the way 1 came in

Jackson hopes his intensity, cou- 
pled with his athletic abilities, will 
pay off soon for the Mastodons

was the same during practice and at 
game time. If they were more con-
