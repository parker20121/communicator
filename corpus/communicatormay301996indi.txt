Joint effort brings 
James Dean play 
to Williams Theatre 



by PaulTupper 
Editor 



Fairmount, Indiana's favoriie son. 
James Dean, is the subject of a play lo 
be performed in IPFW Williams 
Theatre, June 12-15. Presented by 
Purdue-Indiana Theatre in cooperation 
with Fon Wayne Youthcatre, "James 
Dean: The Boy from Fairmount," 
written and directed by Harvey Cocks, 
director of Fort Wayne Youthcatre, 
opens with the car crash in California 
that killed Dean in 1955 

This is the second act for "James 
Dean " Darren Andrews had the lead 
in Cocks' first production. "Larry 
(Life) asked us to be a pan of the sea- 
son, and I felt it was time to rewrite 
some parts of ihe play.' said Cocks. 

The focus of the play is Dean's 
desire for immortality and spans his 
life from age nine to his untimely, 
early death at age 24 Dean also faces 
condia regarding his mother's death. 
his obsession to be loved and his dedi- 
cation to perfecting his craft. 

Fast paced and emotional on many 
levels. "James Dean" shifts through 
the life of the Oscar nominated actor 
(for "Giant," one of only three fihns 
Dean made) while a fresh -from -the - 
accident Dean watches, unable to cor- 
rect many mistakes. 

Three actors portray Dean: Joel 
Moorman leads the casi as the adult 
Dean; Philip Snodderly is cast as ihe 
teenage Dean and Jacob Dahm plays 
Dean as a child Other cast memtx:rs 
include Sarah Forbing as death; Ben 
Hasler as Whiley Rusi; Susan 
Szadkowski as Mildred and Julie; 



Monie Fortney as Winton, Ed Heam 
and the director. Mary Amt)er Bosk as 
Emma, Ortense. and the registrar; 
Frazcr Coffeen as ihe test director, the 
writer and a student; Luke Hancock as 
Ralph, the producer and a student; 
Sara Pauley as Pamela the actress and 
Madge; Ted Brown as Marcus, the 
agent and the conductor; and Judy 
McGroarty as Jane Dcacy and Adeline 
Nail. 

Cocks, a Fon Wayne resident, was 
active in New York theater for 30 
years. He understands why Dean's 
popularity keeps growing after four 
decades. Cocks 
said, "Kids relate 
to the films he 
made. Many relate 
to 'Rebel Withoui 
a Cause.'" 

Cocks, who 
Dean a few times 
in New York, 
thinks few actors 
can match Dean's 
intensity 
"( Leonardo ) 
DiCaprio has it, 
and (the late Rjver) 
Phoenix did too, 
but Jimmy was the 
first, "said Cocks 

"James Dean: 
Tlie Boy from Fairmount," whose sub- 
ject has a museum dedicated lo bim 
located in Fairmount. Ind., is pan of a 
series of productions in the Purdue- 
Indiana Theatre's American Classics

Movie thrills autlience members across the nation 




by ScAtI Lehman 
Staff Writer 

A nviiting dramii, this movie centers around a 
young boy who dreams of becommg an iniema- 
lional Twister champion. As the boy practices the 
Milton Bradley game for hours eath day. he dis- 
covers ho has a rare affliction which deteriorates 
his flexibility His pareais learn to cope with the 
disappointment of his dashed hop&amp;s of becoming 
the world's best Twi'ilcrccanpeliior. 

Also out in theaters is the "Twister," starring 
Bill Pa^iton and Helen Hunt a "movie about the 
weather" as the late-night star David Letierman has 
siaio]. The Film has been one of the summer's best, 
grossing Ml.l million is il^ first weekend (May 
10-12). 

Paxlon and Hunt star as a husband and wife 
who have been separated for some time. Paxton is 
pursuing a divorce settlement as he is preparing to 
marry another woman who just happens to be an 
uplighi sex therapisl. Pxxlon, of "Apollo 13" fame, 
and Hunt, from "Mad About You." both throw In 
outstanding portrayals of their charaeiers. The 
movie centers around one day in which Paxlon, 
Hum and an assonmenl of other co-workers chase 
lomadoes to study them and find a more efficient 



and dmeiy wanting system. This theme Menu from 
the beginning of the Him. when Hunt, as a child, 
walches with her nKither as her father is sucked 
out of a sionn cellar and killed by a lana,- 
do. 

Masl critics acclaim the dip 
t^ effects used in the movie 
to produce the phenom- 
enal shois of the tor- 
nadoes and rightly 
so — the close-ups are 
amazing, especially on 
the big screen. The actors 
are sometimes overlooked, 
though, and ii should be noted 
that Hum and Paxtnn ^c accimi- 
panied by an Impressive suppon- 
ingcasL 

One inleresling point is thai most 
of the stars had one prominent movie 
he or she had starred in previously, and each film 
would pop into my bead occasionally Cary Elwes 
plays a villain in "Twister," and I often piciured 
him with his sword from "The Princess Bride" 
telling the Sicilian Vizzini that truly, he has a 
dizzying intellect. Dill Paxton's role in "Aliens" 
would not leave my mind, and he kept whining. 




"Yeah, man. it's a dry hekt" as he had in that 
sci-fi thriller, Even Cameron from Ferns 
Bueller was chasing iomadoes 1 almost 
expevted Mailhcw fln,»(Jerick to appear 
00 screen to !&gt;klp a day of school 
with him. 
Besides employing a great deal 
of special effects, "Twister" is 
foil of gut-wrenching action 
The film IS rated PG- 13. for 
"intense depiction of very 
bad weather." and will 
most likely cause a tew 
nightmares for movie- 
goers The plot follows most 
and 



make a number of special appearances 

Having never been in the middle of a tornado. I 
cannot tell if this movie is realistic or not. 
"Twister" was produced well enough to make you 
break a sweat and keep your teeih clenched, so 
Steven Spielberg and company must be applauded 
for there efforts Helen Hum. Bill Paxton. Jami 
Gurt?. Cary Elwes and the rest of the talent also 
put forth a tremendous display of acting in the film 
and anyone who sees the movie will feel like he or 
she ha.s been through a 270 mph F-5 tornado 

Look for the sequel at theaters soon: "Right 
Foot Red," tn which Bill Paxion plays the sublime 
spinner for armther up-and-coming Twister conies- 
tani 



recipes Hunt 
and Paxion are reunited 
in the end, but the scripi 
has a few surprises and a 
good number of amusing 
one-liners Everything

On May 26 the sky opened up 
and the rain came down at the QlOl 
Jamboree for the second year in a 
row. Thousands of drenched con- 
cert-goers gathered at the World 
Music Theatre in Chicago in 
celebration of modem rock, 
mosb pits and youth. 

Each year, QlOl, a 
Chicago modem rock sta- 
tion, collects the hottest 
acts in altemative music 
and showcases tbem at 
one venue. The show is 
a sneak-peak of the 
bands who will be most 
likely dominating the 
charts the next year. 
QlOl provides an oppor- 
tunity for music lovers to see 
over ten bands for approximately 
S30, Ticket Master charges and 
parking included. 

No Doubt kicked things off on 
the mainsiage with Cracker follow- 
ing. Then Kom incited the crowd 
into tearing up the lawn and practi- 
cally each other Candelbox, 
Madonna's Maverick Prodigies, 
continued the mainstage show and 
then Everclear kept the energy 
going 

A half-hour later, Dave Grohl 
took Ihe stage with bis band the 
Foofighiers, Besides playing an 
incredible set, Grohl proved once 
again that he really is a nice guy by 
talking to the crowd about bis 
favorite show "The X-I-iles" and 
pulling up with video-inspired 




Menios-thiowing. 

Throughout the day. more com- 
placent attendees huddled under 
blankets and plastic tarps trying lo 
hide from the elements and enjoy 
the sounds coming from the mam 
stage. Braver souls played in the 
Woodstock '95-esque mud 
slide. 

Cyprus Hill finished the 
mamstage activities and were 
the only rap group of the day, 
moving the crowd-bongo- 
heavy rhythm sections 
While bands were 
taking breaks ai the 
mainstage. plenty of 
action could be found 
ai QlOI's Buz7 stage.

Westward opened up Next 
Crarbage put on an intense show 
and the crowd never slopped mov- 
ing through the entire set according 
to one concert-goer, who eerily

Whigs, as of yet, have not hit heavy 
rotation circles on radio stations,

Closing the Buzz stage series of 
bands. Filter absolutely drove the 
crowd into an insane, pulsating. 
moshing mass. The crowd pressed 
so tightly together that any smalt

her feet not touching the ground at 
times or held onto any large avail-

and body-beat caused steam to rise

there was no way of knowing about

Bargain shopping: you don't have to pay the price 



orat 



by Krh Bard 
SUfrWriUr 

I have a challenge for anyone who has ordered from, though! aboui 
ordering from, looked at or even heard of the 
order-by-mail clothing maga/mc J, Crew 
Gel your bands on a copy of this cata- 
log and Stan glancing through casually 
Write down all the prices of the clothes, 
^ i\ J' shoes and other accessories Ihal you would 
^^^^k j^ even consider purchasing Add onto thai 

^^^^^L ^^^ total ihe price of shipping and handling 
^^^^^^ ^H Now look at the Mil from (be last semester 
^^^^^^^ ^B of your college education Guess 
^^^^^^^L^H what (here is a good chance ihe J, Crew 
^I^^^I^B will be MORE than school ! 

^^■^^^^^^^K Is the price of being a trendy individ- 

^^1 ^^^^^^^B ual of the 90's actually worth sacrificing 
^^H ^^^^^^^H your college education? Are diere altci- 
^^^^ ^^^^^^^^B to being nothing more than a 

^^H^^^^B^^I well-dressed fool who completely 
^^^m^^^H ^HL ignorant and devoid of all knowl- 

^KtjI ^W ^F"j edge because they spent their 

^J( U^K money on clothes instead of 

^ ^^" school? This may be a bit of 

an exaggeration, hi 
more and more people 
who do nol have the 
money lo spend on 
such pricey clothing whims 
are rinding out what the worIs 
credit card debt really means 
TTiere are other ways lo gel a J 
Crew look without going through 
the expensive magazines and ouUets 
The answers are no more than 20 minuies away 
from most Fmi Wayne locations One such pin- 
nacle of fashion alternatives... Target. 



&gt; 




II is more than easy and much less painful lo your credit 

card if you just follow some elementary steps to buying 

trendy clothes for less Stores like Target. Walman and 

Kmart all provide clothing basics Plain shins, panes and 

skins are "in" and die trend pan comes from how you put 

these basics together Layering, color coordination and 

acccssonung all make the appearance Bells, shoes and 

jewelry can take a plain white shin and faded jeans and 

turn them into an oulTii seen on such shows as "The House 

of Style" 

Whdc shopping for some specific outfits from a recent J, 
Crew magazine ti was easy to see that the "in trend" wai^ not patented by 
the east coast outfillers Granted that the fabrics and maienaJs the clothing 
is made from will difl'er and the question of quality is always an issue, but 
if it is purely the look you arc searching for. Target can suffice your needs. 
V-neck tees in a mulutude of colors, shapely, thin sweaters made for 
summer, cigarette pants and plaid button-downs as far as the eye can sec 
all are hangmg on the racks at the local stores for prices up to 100 dollars 
less. The best pan is thai there is no shipping and handling or waiUng for 
the clothing. You simply pick out die imposier trendy clothing, take it to 
die register, pay for it and take it home. If the label really means dial much 
to ytMi, buy some medical tape while you are at Target, wnte J Crew on it 
and put II over the genenc one. 

Before setting out lo buy ttie clothing items thai you happen to see in 
some fashion magazine, consider why you are buying it Oodies arc just 
the outside layer of you Your altitude, persona and character are reflected 
through what you wear and therefore you should buy clothing that is 
trendy to you and not to the model who is a si7e zero and can affcnd lo buy 
and wear all sons of weird fashion contraptions Then you need to realize 
one more ihmg Clodimg may reflect what you are or wbai you want to Uy 
to be on the outside, but only true personality can portray who you really 
are on the inside A label alone cannot give you depth nor can a style give 
you soul You are die only one who can provide Uiose elements and as far 
as I know. J Crew no longer keeps souls in stock 

Buy the clothes you want lo buy. but remember that the price you see is 
not always the one you have to pay Grasp your own sense of style, be true 
to younelf and never forget whal each of us are under all of our clothes; 
naked.

Fans lose big at 500s 

rr^ht Indianapolis 500 ran bead big 12 car wreck before ihe sian of 
[1 head againsi the I'.S 500 ihe U S. 500. We hate to see any 



accident ai a race, bul luckily for 
tbe IKL, II happened in Michigan 
If Indy had a I2-car pile up before 
the start of the race, every cOTnmen- 
laior and Monday morning quarter- 
back would have said, "See. I told 
you so " 

Forlunaiely. no one was killed 
during either of Uie races, bul one 
dnver in ihe Indy 500 is in 
condition after a final lap acadeni 
caused by 



JL on Sunday Who won? Who 
lost? Who cares* The childish 
actions of the Indy Racing League 
(IRL) anil Championship Auto 
Racing Teams (CART) have turned 
what was supposed to be a battle 
between the best drivers in the 
world into a war of words 

The only real loser in this war is 
Ihe public The public had lo 
choose belween a race which had 

Ihcir loyally 

for 80 years or 
the drivers 
who have 
become 
famous as a 
result of 

Indianapolis

Andrcilis, the 
Unsers, Ibc 
Pcnskcs or the 
Bcntenhausens 
didn't make 
Ihe 500; Ihe 
500 made 
them. 

Can we, as 



The 500 holds a 

mystique unlike 

any other race and 



at another race 

can change that 

fact. 



Americans, afford lo lose the last 
vcslige of Americana? Can we lei a 
few dark suited ihugs ruin a piece 
of our heritage ' 

The 500 holds a mystique unlike 
any other race and no childish 
attempt at another race can change 
ihai fact Tbe 500 transcended class 
boundaries, America and Indiana in 
particular. The race has become a 
month long event the whole slate 
follows. Even people who do nol 
follow racing watched time trials 
through the month of May On 
Memorial Day. families cook out at 
Ihe lake and follow the race 

Are we wimessing the end of the 
Indy 500 as we know it? We douN 
ii. Some big name driver with a big 
name sponsor will defect from tbe 
CART series and will race at 
Indianapolis Hopefully it won't be 
one of Ihe drivers who caused ihc 



■ perience is 

when Aric Luyendyk was knocked 
out of Indy by a rookie mistake 
craning oul of pit row This year's 
rookies performed well and should 
be congratulated for theu' efforts 
The veterans who raced in 
Michigan failed to crack the lop 
eighi spoLs So much for expcn- 
ence Hopefully, die Indy 500 will 
conlmue as Ihe greatest spectacle in 
racing viHb or without the drivers 
who were made famous by the 
Brickyard Tbe Andrettis and 
Unsers owe their fame to this track 
and should give something back to 
her 

Everything aside, the organizers 
of both events need to take a step 
back and realize that without Ihe 
public or the mystique, both races 
will fall into obscurity The 
Indianapolis 500 could become 
(God forbid) just another race.

Fathers need to reclaim their place 




There is a crisis in America; and no town, 
ciiy or district is immune from the disease lliis 
affliction invades nearly half the bomes in 

America and leaves many of our children with- !."'!'"'!?.'!'„!!- """o'"^ ''"'' "' ^ "'^^ 
out a father 



tbe nigbt and feed bis child. He needs lo 

truly listen lo bis children's problems. 
He does not even need to provide an 
answer he jusi needs to listen The 
problem mav seem minimal, but if your 
Lbild believes the problem is important 
enough to bring lo you. then you, the 
father have the obligauon lo listen. End 
the ridiculous answer of, "Qo ask your 
moiher 

We are fathers and we must recover our 
steadily diminishing place in die home. 
Why have we left all the tnily fun things 
10 Ihe mothers? When 1 was in Cub 
Scouls and Boy Scouts as a child, most 
Den parents were mother?. By iliai same exam- 
ple, why are there few, if any, fathers who are 



We have seen what Uie lack of a strong father 
has done to the inner aties The welfare syMem 
is to blame in the inner cities. Their idiotic 
requirement for ihe father to be absent has sent 
children out into the world without the guidance 
and the strength a famer can teach ihem What 
the welfare system does is perpetuate 20ih cen- 
tury slavery where Ihe breakup of families is still 
the fundamental threat to keep people "in line." 

Ironically, we pay homage to our fathers in 



Scouts or Brownies? 

Most elementary teachers are women. Why 
have men failed to follow this noble profession'* 
Elementary school is one of the most mfluential 
times in a child's Ufe and we, as men, have for- 
saken those places in a child's development lo 
become mulu-million dollar CEOs, lawyers and 
real estate agents. 

We have let society decide that being a pre- 
school teacher or elementary school teacher is 
not a noble profession for a man We have been 



just two weeks. This holiday has never had the pctsuaded to follow along with ihe lie that 
excilemeni of Molhefs Day Father's Day """"^V ^ ""°^^^ «"« ^'^ °^ """« ^ ^''^'^'^ 
seems like a poorly planned afterlboughi 
brought about by Hallmark to sell a few more 
cards Will America ever see the day when 
Father's Day receives ihe same kind of treat- 
ment from society that Mother's Day does? 

The answer lo that question lies within us, the 
fathers of today The contemporary father needs 
lo ignore the "estrogen -centnc" bravado and 
fighi to regain our places in society We must 
shoulder much of the blame. The stereotypical 
absent father needs to wake up in the middle of 



concern earning money, mowing grass and 
changing the oil in the family mini-van And 
why not, mowing grass and changing oil is 
much simpler than being a parent. All these 
duties have manuals to tell us exactly how to do 
It, but Ibere is not one universal manual lo tell us 
how to be a father A parent musi learn by inal 
and error -bow to raise a child If we put tn the 
oil wrong the car dies, but if we make a mistake 
in disciplinmg a child there is no blinking light 
on dieir forehead to tell us. We can only make 



an educated guess whether we have made a mis- 
take, but if you have not made Ihe cffon lo get to 
know your child how can you tell what their 
reaction means? 

If you doubt a father' s societal role is to make 
money then why are so many mothers petition- 
ing to have his support payments paid Hardly 
ever does anyone hear of a 'Deadbeai Dad" who 
makes his payments on lime but spends no time 
with their child. Women have bought into this 
lie also Women have been historically lold to 
find a man to support ihcm and their children. 

There is a reason, call it divine if you wish, 
that two people are needed lo create a life. Bul 
thai creation deserves to be raised by two peo- 
ple A father or mother does not have lo be there 
in the home all the time to he a good parent 
Many of my generation grew up in divorced 
households, but many of us knew both of our 
parents Our fathers fought the sysiem and lost 
custody, bul ihey never lost sight of their 
responsibibties Our faUiers were granted visita- 
tion rights and never overlooked a chance lo 
spend time with their child 

Today Ihe system has changed, and more 
fathers are granted custody on the basis of being 
a more qualified parent The archaic practice of 
granting the mother custody sunply on the basis 
of her womb is gradually t&gt;eing refuted But with 
this change comes greater responsibility upon 
the father He needs lo be there for each skinned 
knee, baseball game, cookie sale, treat day and 
pre-school graduation. He needs lo go lo PTA 
meetings He needs to take time off work lo 
attend parent -teacher conferences. 

Along with this great responsibility, comes a 
greater reward which cannot be measured by 
doUiu signs or bouses sold or cases won. Take 
back the chair ai the head of the table. Take back 
Ihe role of disciplinarian. Take back your place 
as your child's father 



Gays win back rights from Colorado, Supreme Court 




Paul 
Tupper 



Amtruimeni 2 is dead. Amendment 2 n dead. 
Ht bo Ihe merry go. Amendment 2 is dead 

If 1 sound excited, excuse me 1 am The 
United States Supreme Court decided 
Colorado's Amendment 2 banning legislation lo 
gay civil rights is unconstitutional. 

I'm not gon' frown on the time it took this 
nine judge panel to conclude what ovef ten per- 
cent of Ihe world population already knew. I'm 
nol gonna lei this decision — a historical one 
because Ihc highest of high courts has never 
ruled in favor of gays — give me false optimism 
regarding gay freedom. I'm not even gonna 
shove this victory in the faces of all the fai red- 



necks who thought gays would stare 
longingly at them while showering in 
Ihe military. 

But what I will do is Tight. This vic- 
tory has given me the ambition to keep 
righting for what should be mine . . . 
ours: Equalily We have lost so many 
balUes in the noi-so-distant past And 
our knight in shining armor, Bill 
Clinton, has set us aside lo colleen dust 
He promised us he would allow gays in 
Ihe miUiary, This promise got hun elect- 
ed Yet little did we know we would 
have to sacrifice freedom of speech and 
expression to do it. He has recently stated be is 
not in favor of gay marriages. We clearly cannot 
count on Billy to help us, we must help our- 
selves. There is so much work stiL to do 

This decision means things can change And 
to make those changes we need to duplicate the 
fighting taaics used on Amendmenl 2. We need 
to utilise our straight fnends, and their friends, 
and their friend's friends We may have not 
been so successful if many in Itie straight world 
hadn't rallied behind us and boycotted 
Colorado. The state lost millions of dollars 
because of convention cancellations and absent 
vacauoners The message made its way to the 
Supreme Court. 



Hopefully, if nothing else, this victory will 
leach closeted gays that Ihey can openly be the 
person they so desperately long to be. If we, as a 
community, can win in the Supreme Courl, 
there is nothing we can't fight . and win! 
Parents around the country had tbe opportunity 
10 wimess injustice before their very eyes. This 
decision affecLs them loo Their children have 
been exposed to gays on a massive scale. There 
is now much to discuss around the dinner table. 

This exposure will prove, in (he end (but 
hopefully sooner), that gays arc equal and 
should be treated as such Elizabeth Taylor once 
said Hollywood would nol exist if it weren't for 
the efforts of gays. (To Ihis Whoopi Goldberg 
replied, "You have just turned Ihe graves of 
many men in C!alifomia cemeteries ") And she 
is righL Gays have proven to be Ihe most cre- 
ative, thought-provoking, accepting people. 
Why aren't we loved, or al least endured, as 
much as straights? I'll tell you why, because 
deep down, straight people see themselves in us 
and are jealous we have rLsen to the occasion. 
Many straight people don't believe they could 
ever do what we have done, and for that lack of 
confidence, they are nght. They can't do it. And 
until gays are looked upon as equal, this flgbl 
will iK&gt;i end. 

We're here, we're queer, gel used to it.'

A study completed by the IPFW 
Community Research Institute 
(CRD and commissioned by Ihe 
Fort Wayne Sports Corporation. 
reveals the economic impact sport- 
ing evenLs can have on Fort Wayne, 
Thomas L Guthrie, director of the 
CRI. and Valerie Richardson, 
research associate, released the 
report. 

According to Guthrie, the data 
shows what Fori Wayne can expect 
in terms of attendance profiles and 
visitor spending at sporting events 
in tbc city The study results are 
ba«d upon economic data of sever- 
al .sporting events studied during 
the Fort Wayne Bicentennial in 
1994 Events studied included die 
Continental Basketball League 
(CBA) and International Hockey 
League (IHL) AU-Siar festivities, 
Indiana High School Athletic 
Association semi-state wrestling, 
semi-slate girls and boys basketball 
and scmi-staie baseball tourna- 
ments, the Mad Anthony's 
Celebrity Golf Toumamenl, and the 



NCAA Men's Volleyball 
Championships, among others 

The report shows that 14 bicen- 
tennial-related sporting evenLs gen- 
erated more Uian 70,000 attendees 



"...direct 
spending by 

visitors results 
in increased 

sales, income 
and jobs..." 



and about 'Si 8 million in direct 
spending, including food and drinic, 
uckeis. shopping, lodging, conces- 
sions, enienaimncnt. transponaiion 



and parking. Of the mcnuoned cat- 
egories, the largest amount of 
money was spent on food and drink 
(25 1 percent) 

The study also indicated Uiat a 
majority of attendees at the events 
(61 8 percent) were from northeast 
Indiana and northwest Ohio The 
remaining 38 2 percent, or 16.175 
attendees, were truly visitors to 
Fori Wa)Tie. The visitors made up a 
majonty of the direct expenditures- 
Si I milbon. 

According to the report, "obvi- 
ously, direct spending by visitors 
results in increased sales, income 
and jobs for residenLs of the com- 
munity Furthermore, these 
increa.scd dollars flowing into the 
community circulate within tbc 
community, thereby generating 
additional sales, jobs and income "

A father, a son and the ball glove incident 




Lait Cbrisimas I received a 
poem ttotn my Faiher. Ii was a 
touching piece or work, eliciling the 
hopes and dreams he had for bis 
only son. Ii reminded me Ihat 
through ihc years he kepi an 
unblemished record beside his 
name and hoped Ihal I too could 
accomplish the same feat. 

Having a son of my own and 
carrying the name of my father - 
yes, I am a junior ■ ihe poem held a 
touch more meaning for me and 
Dad. Sec, 1 have always had lo hve 
with the uncertainly of expectations 
and certainly of not living up to 
them. 

We rarely, if ever, played catch, 
my father and I. Instead, I ventured 
out lo find my own backstops. And 
while Dad worked long and hard to 
provide for bis family. 1 tirelessly 
tossed a hardball at the back of the 
garage. 

Then one summer die excrement 
bit tbe oscillating device. 1 was test- 
ing out my latest discovery, a slow- 
molion fastball, in the back yard. 
Thunk. . thunk. crack ..oops! 

My Nolan Ryan. Luis Tiani, 



"Cat (i sh" 
Hunter faslball 
split tbe third 
board up from 
tbe bottom on 
the garage. 
What was 1 
going to do? I 
couldn't hide it. 
after all, that 
was Dad's 
garage. It was 
filled lo the 
rafters with the 
toys of bis hob- 
bies, old tires, half-rebuilt carbure- 
tors out of some long-forgoltcn hot 
rod. various wrenches and sockets, 
hammers and screwdrivers, Yeah, 
that was Dad's garage and 1 had 
broken it. 

A million echoes of Ihe old 
man's temper reverberated in my 
mind "How many limes have 1 lold 
you not to throw the ball against ihe 
garage!?" My head ached, I ran lo 
my room hoping againsi hope that 
somehow this episode was either 
something out of a bad dream or 
else an episode of "Leave it to 
Beaver" 

No matter how many limes I 
looked and re-lookcd at the back of 
Dad's garage, that split board slill 
hung there, exposing the sheathing 
10 tbe wind and ram, the lorments 
of mother naiuie 

Out in the yard, just a couple of 
feel from where my life seemed to 
end and tbe broken garage board 
began, lay my glove and well-worn 
baseball. Tbe tools of my hobby, 
the very tools thai had laughl me so 
much about boyhood Yet these 
were ibe very same weapons that 



would be used as evidence in my 
own personal tnal of the century, 

1 am certain 1 rolled over thai 
night and cried myself to sleep, 
thinking of the terror awaiting me 
as soon as Pops discovered my 
crime I don'l remember exactly, 
bui 1 am sure that I also went lo bed 
without supper lhat particular 
evening. 

And then it came. With each 
new dawn I usually awoke with an 
exuberance and lust for life This 
day was different though, this was 
Saturday and Dad wasn't working. 
Undoubtedly he had already discov- 
ered the evidence of my transgres- 
sion and awaited my arrival at the 
breakfast table. 

Getting dressed, tears welled in 
my eyes, A fright for life, or more 
clearly the end of my life, swelled 
in my being Walking downstairs 
and into the kitchen, 1 cringed He 
sat at the table readmg the morning 
newspaper. 1 bolted for Ihe back 
door and out into Ihe yard. 

Running to my pitcher's mound, 
I expected to find my glove and ihe 
ball 1 had used lo break the board 
on Dad's garage. It wasn't there. 
Now 1 was really filled with terror 
Not only had 1 marred the shell of 
Dad's garage, but my glove and 
baseball wert missing. 

My head hung low as I shuffled 
back inio Ihe bouse Slowly, tmiid- 
ly. 1 made my way into the kitchen. 
He looked up. He returned back to 
bis daily reading He mumbled 
something about how well the 
Yankees bad been playing or .some- 
thing and sat quietly at tbe table, A

was supposed lo rain. He hid it

The same weapons with which I 
wounded Dad's garage. Maybe it's 
for Ihe best, afier all, who knows 
whai terrible memories their dis-
