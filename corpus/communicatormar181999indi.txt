Changes in store for library 



by MishannaWood, 
News Editor 

For twenlj-five years the 
Helmke Librar&gt;' has not undergone 
a change as great as the one in 
process on the fourth noor, said 
Judith Violeite, director of the 
HeJmke Libran-, 

Construction that started 
almosi six v/eeVs ago on the fourth 
floor of HelmlvC is the beginning of 
the Science Information Center 
and an electronic training center. 

"The construction should be 
done by April. We should start 
teaching bj' summer, if not sum- 
mer, definitel)' fall," said Cheryl 
Truesdell. assistant director of the 
Helmke Library. 

Funding for the librarj' came 
from last year's Helmke Library 
campaign and the Helmke Librar)' 
Endowment. 

"The project plans have been 
worked on for a year. Regular 



money was held back to renovate 
Helmi^e," Violette said. 

According to Dave Danielson, 
director of the Physical Plant, the 
campuswide campaign to raise 
monej' for the library was the first 
one since 1982, when the Helmke 
library' Endowment first started. 

The construction for the 
teaching lab is S70.000 and con- 
struction for the science librao' is 
250,000, Danielson said. 

The fourth floor was chosen 
for renovation because the science 
materials are stored there, said 
Violette. 

The new technology will 
update IPPW to the 21st century 
and help maintain the science 
materials. 

Violette said the new addition 
would also serve as a place to 
teach students and staff about all 
the electronic information sources 
available to them. 

The computer sjstems can 
link to CD-Rom and web materials 



pertaining to the library, added 
Violette. 

"There is shared access with 
the Allen Count&gt;' Libraries," said 
Danielson, 

Helmke's new facilities will 
require more facultj- than we cur- 
rently have, said Violette. 

Dee Holiday, the assistant 
librarian at Helmke, will be the 
new science librarian. 

The new science librarian will 
operate equipment on the top 
floor, 

Holidaj' will provide user 
assistance to applied departments 
and health sciences. She will train 
users how to operate the biblio- 
graphic information. 

"This is an experiment. We'll 
give it a cr&gt; and see how it wort^. 
When our staffing is built up, 
hopefully we can coordinate with 
other ser\'ices in town," Violette 
said. 



Students participate 

in Visual Design Association 

by Came Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 



As part of an effort to better aid graphic design 
art students, a group of students have recently put 
together a Visual Design Association of Fort Wayne. 

"We would like our associadon to be an educa- 
tion and networking organization for students to 
leam more about graphic design in our region," said 
Lee Ann Gebhard, graphic design student and tempo- 
rar&gt;' chair for the organization. 

Due to the fast-paced graphic design industry, 
graphic arts students were beginning to feel that they 
were not receiving sufficient training and informa- 
tion, according to Gebhard, 

"The demographics of the student population in 
the fine arts program has changed dramaticallj since 
the program began," Gebhard said, "I think that more 
students now are interested in graphic design 
because it is more employable." 

The Visual Design Association is hoping to inter- 
act with the business community of Fort Wajne and 
also the entire nation in order to keep those interest- 
ed in graphic design updated. 

"We want to educate students about design 



potential and new innovative ideas outside of the 
fort Wayne area," Gebhard said. 

Both Gebhard and AnnMarie LeBlanc, associate 
professor of fine arts and faculty adviser for the asso- 
ciation, think that students will be able to learn a 
great deal more just by communicating. 

"We find that we leam an awful lot just sharing 
information with each other. It's nice to be able to 
have a forum now where we can do that," Gebhard 
said. 

Elections for officers will be held at the next 
meeting on Monday. March 22, at noon in Fine Arts 
Rm. 1 10, The goals and objectives of the organizadon 
will also be discussed. 

"We want to make sure that all the students in 
all the departnu'nts feel open to participate in this," 
Gebhard said. "We would like to have an organization 
that recognizes various forms of graphics as art 
forms." 

The association also hopes to aid graphic design 
art students in learning how to use Macintosh soft- 
ware, since currently onl&gt; IBM s&gt;slems are available 
for students. Currently Macintosh is used by the 
majorit)' of graphic designers. 

For more information on the Visual Design 
Association, contact Gebhard at 637-G822. 



Navy offers technical positions 



by Carrie Leathers 
Chiei Reporter 



Students siud&gt;'ing engineer- 
ing, chemistry, physics, and or cal- 
culus will have a chance to discuss 
employment possibilities in the 
U.S. Nuclear Navy program on 
Friday. March 19, 

Capt. Bon Heath, Engineering 
Officer on board the USS Carl 
Vinson, will meet with those inter- 
ested In ET 1 1 5 at noon. 

"People in these positions will 



probabl&gt; be taking care of equip- 
ment and electronics," said Carlos 
Raez, professor and Chair of the 
department of engineering. "This 
is not reall&gt; the fighting side of 
the nai'). it's more like the techni- 
cal side." 

Students to take positions as 
nuclear power officers, profession- 
al instructors, and design/ 
research engineers are all being 
sought by the navy and can be 
paid up to S2100 per month while 
they finish college. 

"These are not positions that 



the nav&gt; can give to high school 
graduates," Raez said. "The nav&gt;' is 
looking for highly skilled labor." 

Anyone interested may attend 
the meeting, however students 
must be at least a sophomore and 
must have completed one academ- 
ic year of calculus and one acade- 
mic jear of calculus-based physics 
to be eligible for the program.

Raez at raez'^ipfw.cdu/ or call

Discount card errors 
create confusion 



by Mistianna Wood, 
News Editor 



of the store managers of Shoe Carnival, 
it stopped running discounts for col- 
lege students in 1996. 

"We do offer discounts for stu- 
dents who bring in a good report 
card." said Rockwell. 

Rockwell said Shoe Carnival has 
had problems in the past with other 
businesses who did not receive verifi- 
cation to publish J discount. 

Smith accepts responsibility for 
the problems. 

"I admit to be at fault for the mis- 
takes on the discount card." said 
Smith. 

According to Smith, because the 



During a Friday lunch rush last 
August, one of the owners of El Charro 
was presented with discount card 
from IPFW. 

It stated students could receive a 
20 percent discount off their entire 
bill. 

The customers were upset because 
[he owner would not give them the 
discount. 

According to the owtii-r, whose According to imim. Dccause me

the incident occurred at El Charro. 

"We've only had one or two com- 
plaints. I've had 



"We've 
only had 
one or two 
complaints." 

Ryan Smith, 



agreed on with R&gt;an Smith. SAB stu- 
dent body programmin 
Si\t&gt;-one busi- 
nesses are listed on 
the card. According to 
Smith, all of them 
made a verbal agree- 
ment and no confir- 
mation papers were 
signed to close 
agreements. 

The owner of El 
Charro believes con- 
firmation papers are 
an excellent idea that 
would save headaches 
and frustration, 

"I'm not happy. 
This puts the ser\'ice 
in a bad light and 
puts the customers in 
a bad light." said the 
owner of El Charro. . 

Mama Mia's Pizza, also listed on 
the card to give a five percent dis- 
count, had a similar problem when 
Angi Reid, a junior at IPFW.used the 
card last Januar&gt;'. 

"1 ordered from there once a 
month and remembered my student 
discount card. The manager said they 
were not authorized to ijse It," said 
Reid. 

Mama Mia's did grant her a dis- 
count, as an ejiception to the rule. 

One of the general managers of 
Mama Mia's Pizza, Todd Blanton, said 
if any documentation existed discounts 
would be granted. 

"Most forms of advertising do 
require documentation. Someone took 
that as an 'OK', we can do it," said 
Blanton. 

According to Blanton. this 
incident was a result of 
miscommunication. 

"This was not put together profes- 
sionally, at least a signature from 
someone. a commitment is 
made-proof in writing. For none of 
this to be done, 1 consider none of this 
to be finalized." said Blanton. 

Although one of the owners was 
asked if the establishment would like 
to be on the card, Blanton said no con- 
firmation or termination information 
was sent on the matter. 

Shoe Carnival, also on the card. 



number of people call 
and say they want to 
be on the card," said 
Smith. 

Smith and Kim 
Jacobs, Student 

Activities director, said 
the Student Activities 
Board was never 
involved with the 
cards during the first 
four years of 
circulation. 

Due to a void in 



- the responsibility of 
program director creating the cards, 

"If it were not 
for Ryan, the cards 
ma\ not have been made at all," said 
Jacobs. 

Smith said he followed the format 
used in past years and added more 
businesses than were on the old card. 

However, confirmation sheets 
exist from the cards of years past, 
according to Holly Logan, administra- 
dve assistant of student government. 

"With eight weeks left in the 
school year, how do jou get the word 
out?" said Jacobs. 

"The cards have been passed out 
to many people. 1 don't know how to 
communicate the problem," added 
Jacobs. 

Student government is tr&gt;ing to 
get an improved discount card. 

Currently, Rob Loper, chairmari 
on the committee for student affairs, is 
working on a new discount card. 

The card looks like a credit card 
and has an eight hundred number on 
the back if an&gt; problems occur, 

Loper is hoping to have the card 
available by next fall. 

"Meetings open to anyone are 
being set up with various companies," 
said Loper.

Letter to the student body 



IPSGA President addresses issue of 
tax-exempt textbooks 



To the student body, 

This is a for your informa- 
tion only letter on the subject 
of textbook prices- 
Textbook prices are the 
concern of every student on 
every campus. Whether it is 
the absurd amount of money 
we pay for them when we leave 
the bookstore or the miniscule 
amount we get back when the 
semester is over. Textbook 
prices are always on our 
minds. 

There are several ways to 
save money on textbooks that 
have become popular over the 
last couple of semesters. 

A student may save money 
buying used from a friend, 
Internet sources like Varsity 
Books (which should be offi- 
cially be registered with IPFW 
in the next semester), and now 
a new way of saving monej- is 
through the tax that is put on 
textbooks. 

Student governments 
across Indiana support state 
representatives Klinker, Bauer, 
and Scholor who wrote legisla- 
tion for the Indiana State 
Legislature that would enable 
all college students within . the 
state of Indiana to purchase 
textbooks free from taxation. 

Currently the bill is in the 
Ways and Means Committee 
waiting on floor debate. 



College students in the states 
of Virginia and Michigan do 
not paj' taxes on textbooks. 

I, along with several other 
Student Body Presidents in our 
state, signed a resolution that 
states our student body feels 
that tax-exempt textbooks are 
an important issue. That is not 
enough. 

1 urge each student to con- 
tact a state legislator so we can 
have this in effect as soon as 
possible. The more students 
who voice their concern the 
more likely the bill will get 
passed. 

Due to privacy issues 1 can 
not give out e-mail addresses 
in an editorial, but I can give 
an avenue to the e-mail 
addresses. 

The homepage for our 
state legislators is 

http://burr.ai.org/legisla 
tive/index.html/ 

I urge every student to 
contact a stale representative 
so we can be in the companj' of 
Virginia and Michigan to have 
this luxury. 



Sincerely, 

Joe Schroeder 

Student Body President

TOPIC: 

Overpopulation 

WHAT WE 
THINK: 

There might be 
too many people 
in this world. 



Did &gt;ou know that in 1950 
the population of this planet was 
2.52 billion? 

In less than 50 years that 
number has doubled to the amaz- 
ing figure of about 5.8 billion in 
1997. 

There has been much specu- 
lation as to whether or not there 
are coo many humans here on 
the planet, and whether or not 
we are destroying the planet. 

We're not going to argue 
about humans destro&gt;'ing the 
planet, because there are enough 
other people complaining about 
it, and there is really not much 
that one person can do. 

One individual can make a 
difference though, when it comes 
to deciding whether or not to 
reproduce. 

Just think about this: People 
are living a lot longer now with 
the medical advances thai have 
been made. Just today we read 
about chemicals that are pro- 
duced in the body naturally that 
may be a cure lor HIV. 

In this century we have been 
able to cure many deadly dis- 
eases. This means that as people 
grow older and older that there 
will be more people on this plan- 



et as we continue to reproduce. 

Another thing lo take into 
account is that 80 percent of the 
world's population li\'es in 
underdeveloped or undeveloped 
countries. 

The inhabitants of these 
countries are, for the most part, 
poor and malnourished and diffi- 
cult to take care of, especially in 
the case of controlling disease. 

One hard fact to face is that 
diseases, illnesses and viruses 
seem to spread tike 
wildfire. 

Maybe this will be 
the way that nature 
keeps population 
numbers down. It 
happened in Europe 
^vi^h the Bubonic 
plague; it's bound to 
happen some w here 
else. 

Some of the 
research we conduct- 
ed indicated that the 
main sources for pop- 
ulation control are 
birth control, abor- 
tion and policies such 
as the ones set up in 
China where, un til 
recentlj, a family was 
o n 1 &gt;' allowed one 
child. 

These policies, 
however, are chang- 
ing-even though they 
are needed more 
today than before. 

People don't seem 
to have a problem 
with birth control for 
the most part, and 
abortion is a subject 
that we aren't going 
to touch with a 20- 
foot stick. 

More initiatives 
need to be taken, 
howe\er. to educate 
the public about the 



seriousness of the problem. 

We don't exactly condone 
China's former methods for Urn 
iting population growth but w( 
do feel some new plan must be 
implemented to keep the popul. 
tion of the world from growing at 
its current astronomical rate. 

Something has to be done 
about our vvorld's population. At 
this rate there will be 15 billion 
people before we die. 

Think carefully before you 
consider reproducing.

Letter to the Editor 



students urged to vote on campus election day 



Fellow students of Indiana 
Universii) -Purdue University Fort 
Wajne. I am glad to see a small num- 
ber of candidates, but at the same 
time I am saddened because there are 
a small humber of candidates. 

In three of the four Executive 
ofFices there is only one candidate. All 
of the candidates are very qualified 
for the position the&gt; will obtain. The 
fourth race, which is always highly 
contested, is Student Body President. 

Joseph Schroeder is doing a great 
job. He did a great job as Vice 



President building on to the items dis- 
cussed this summer and adding to 
that list. Joe has always been \ery 
reachable and friendlj- and 1 do not 
see a change in him that would make 
him different. 

Joe was ver&gt; instrumental in 
starting the calculator prograjn at 
IPFW, helping to get web-basetPtext 
book sales for students to sell their 
hooks and lower the cost for other stu- 
dents, and tr&gt;ing to get end of the 
semester evaluations posted to stu- 
dents. Some of the problems faced did 



not fail because of lack of motivation, 
but because of legal complications 
perceived bj the Uni\'ersitj'. 

Joe will make a GREAT Student 
Bod)' President. A better president 
than those I ha\e seen. I hope you will 
vote for Joe when &gt;ou fill out your 
ballots. The places and times are listed 
in this paper, please get out there and 
vote, and vote for Joe.

Commentary 



What's Wealc this Week 



Can )'ou believe that this semes- 
ter is alreadj half-way over? Where 
does time go? I think the reason time 
flies is because the more responsibili- 
ties we have, the less time we have to 
do them in. It seems that you never 
have free time jn&gt;more. Like at the 
end of the day. when you want to 
relax, jou still have things that you 
have to do. Like homework. 

The calculus class that I am tak- 
ing this semester is beating me up 
prett&gt;' bad. fhe challenge is in under- 
standing the concepts, working on the 
homework, then taking a "brain 
dump" when 1 take the exams. I am 
getting a a decent grade right now, 
but onl) because I have a tutor, if it 
weren't for him, I would have dropped 
it weeks ago. College is hard. You 
would think that I would have It down 
b&gt; now, after all, I am a senior, and an 
old one at that. I started college the 
first time in the fall of 1983. 

Ha\'ing just graduated from a 
decent Catholic high school in central 
Indiana, 1 assumed that Bloomington 
wouldn't be all that bad. Besides the 
population of students, and the 
expense, what was the difference 
between high school and college an&gt;- 
ways7 Okay, besides the beer. This was 
going to be an easy transition 1 
thought. Plus, there would be chicks, 
parties and lU basketball. It was also 
rated, at the time, as one of the top 
five party schools in the country. It 
was going to be a blast. I could handle 
it. I wouldn't flunk out. Boy was I 
wrong. 

My parents were very upset, and I 
didn't blame them. After all, I was a 
pretty smart kid. I never got into 
major trouble, hung out with the good 



kids, and met all of m&gt; responsibilities 
before I went out. Fhis of course, was 
when 1 lived at home with my parents. 
1 just wasn't mature enough to deal 
with the infinite distractions at 
Indiana Universit&gt;'. 1 wasn't ready for 
college like I thought I was. I basically 
partied like a Kennedy and flunked 
ouL This was totally my fault, and m&gt; 
responsibility. What was I thinking? 
Here I am, sixteen years later, 33 years 
old. and a semester away from a bach- 
elor's. Soon. I'll be able to saj that I 
am a college graduate. Yippee. 

I tried to find ideas for a column 
this week, but my brain is sort of 
mushy. M&gt; dear mother, who has 
been living with cancer for the past 
ten &gt;ears, took a bad turn last week 
when she suffered a heart attack. I 
flew down to Florida for a couple of 
da&gt; s to spend time with her while she 
was in the hospital. I was also able to 
visit with my father and my older sis- 
ter. This is one of Che reasons I ha\en't 
been appearing in the paper as much 
as I was last semester-l just don't have 
the spare time. I'll tell &gt;ou what, there 
isn't a worse feeling than seeing some- 
one you love living in pain, hanging 
on, trying to stretch their life out for 
the people around them. 

About five years ago. when I 
returned to college, I think my mom 
was the most proud of me. She told 
me to do m&gt;' best, and not to worr&gt;' 
about grades. "Tr&gt;ing is more impor- 
tant than succeeding" she would say. 
M&gt; dad and mom are both college 
grads, so the pressure was on. I had to 
graduate to please m&gt; parents, but 
also, to make them proud. I'm also 
doing this for me. and of course my 
wife, who has supported me the whole

time. I always joke around that if I 
hadn't llunked out of lU, I would have 
never moved to California and met my 
wife! Things happen for a reason. 1 
feel lucky that I have been able to 
participate in the educational process. 
I am going to be able to accomplish 
more with a degree. I just wish my 
mom could stick around to see it. 

1 don't know how much longer 
she will be around. The doctors have 
said that she is really sick this time. I 
feel in my heart thai she is still the 
most proud of me. besides m&gt; wife of 
course. M&gt; dad is cool about the 
degree thing, but I think he expected 
me to get one. So there is no reason to 
jump for joy. But 1 know that he is 
proud of me, whether he actually tells 
me or not, he's proud. 

When 1 was in Florida last week, I 
realized this was going to be the last 
time that I would see my mother alive. 
I'm still dealing with this. She has 
always been a fighter. She is your typi- 
cal Irish-Catholic woman. She won't go 
down easy. She is loved b&gt; many peo- 
ple and has achieved manj things in 
her lifetime. Seven years ago, she had 
a hole-in-one, after thirtj years of 
playing gold She was my tennis coach 
in high school: the first woman to e^'e^ 
coach a men's team in Indiana high 
school athletics. She raised t^vo won- 
derful children, and she had a loving 
husband for over 38 years. Her life 
was wonderful, and I'm glad 1 was a 
part of it. It will be difficult when she 
is gone. She was a hell of a woman, 
and she and mj dad were great par- 
ents. For this, 1 am thankful. Hang in 
there mom, and remember, there is a 
special place in heaven just for you.

The Thin Red Line' marks big conneback for retired director 



by Ben Freese, 

Staff Writer 



One week an actor is hot; the 
next month, he/she can't find a job 
an&gt;'^%'hcre in the business. 

Suddenly, legends are reduced 
to doing the work considered 
"beneath" them. 

Often, the work of a "genius" is 
passed over in favor of what's con- 
sidered "in," 

In Hollywood, the dream for 




opportunity is the true goal, but 
regardless of the disappointment 
many meet with, people keep perse- 
vering in the hope of finding enter- 
tainment work. 

Sometimes, a person who has 
"made it" even gets out of the busi- 
ness completely, wishing for a 
chance at a peaceful life without the 
dream of fame. 

It seemed as though the dream 
had ended for director Terrence 
Malick when he suddenly left his 
quiet, almost non-existent career as a 
feature film director in Hollywood. 

Twenty years later, Malick has 
re-emerged and the thin line he'd 
had between failure and success'in 
the past is now ready to be crossed. 

The Hollywood measuring Mick 
that awaits the professed "cinematic 
master" is Academy Awards nighi. 

During this one fateful evening, 
a small group of people will decide 
whether his new film is worth) of 
praise, or if it'll wind up being "just 
another movie," 

Terrence Malick does not have 
the typical qualifications of the stan- 
dard Hollywood director. 



He avoids the limelight con- 
stantly, whether he's not allowing his 
photograph to be taken, or ignoring 
requests for interviews that date 
back to 1974. 

He readily insists that "making 
movies isn't the only thing in life," 
and has been in seclusion for the last 
two decades. 

The famed recluse only has 
three movies to his credit, including 
the new feature "The Thin Bed Line." 

Terrence Malick is an enigma in 
Hollj'wood, and, if not for this Rnal 
chance to discover the dream of 
worldwide notoriety so man&gt; others 
have sought, he may veo' well come 
back to the entertainment world 
again. 

During his 20-ycar layoff, 
Malick tried unsuccessfully many 
times to start up new movie projects 
that he later slowly gave up on. 

He began to spend enormous 
amounts of time in the librar&gt;' and 
made a journe)' to studj Buddhism 
in the Himalayas that close friends 
dubbed his "quest" to find some 
kind of greater wisdom. 

One of his pleasures on the way 



to seeking this wisdom was another 
book he was thinking about turning 
into a movie, the James Jones war 
novel "The Thin Red line." 

Year upon j ear passed as he 
worked on the screenplay until it 
was Rnally done. 

It was finally time for the SS- 
year-old director to return for possi- 
bly his last stab at attaining success 
in Holly\vood. 

The announcement of his return 
was made, and Malick received 
something he'd never gotten before 
in his careen hj pc. 

His unheard fairy tale-like story 
of a once-great director coming out 
of a 20-year retirement with a great 
new war movie ga\e Malick the 
most publicity of his career as a 
director. 

Many newspapers carried the 
news of his story almost a year 
before the film's release. 

This seemed to finally be the 
"big event" movie that would pull 
everybodj in, from the critics over- 
joyed at Malick's return to the excit- 
ed fans awaiting the director's myth- 
ical new movie. 



Unfortunately, so far the success 
of Malick's return is simply that- a 
myth. 

On Feb. 9. the Academy Award 
nominees were announced and 
Malick's career was kept on the res- 
pirator. 

"The Thin Red Line" gathered 
up three of the major award nomina- 
tions which include Best Picture, Best 
Director and Best Adapted 
Screenplay. 

Even though the announcement 
has done nothing for the movie yei, 
the assumption is that regardless of 
its bad performance in theaters (only 
gaining back a putrid S30 million of 
its S80 million budget) and mixed 
reviews, there is still the off-chance 
that it could revitalize the movie into 
a hit if any awards are won at the 
71st Academy Awards. 

In the end, "The Thin Red Line" 
maj not win awards or e\'en be a big 
hit, but it's done an important thing: 
It let Terrence Mahck find and real- 
ize the dream that ever&gt;'one in 
Hollywood strives for in his first and 
perhaps final time of true nation- 
wide recognition. 



Mexjcan-AmerIcan folk sInqer 

COMES TO IPFW 



Mexican-American folk 
music scholar and interpreter 
Jesus "Chuy" Negrete presents 
"Five Hundred Years of 
Mexican/Chicano History in 
Song" Thursday, March 25, at 
10 a.m. in the Walb Ballroom. 

Negrete, one of the fore- 
most authorities on Mexican- 
American folk songs, uses 
Chicano/Latin folk songs, 
poetry and other folk tradi- 
tions as examples of how 
Latinos preserve history 
through song and legend. 
Negrete's music spans 500 
years of history and struggle. 

Bom in San Luis, Mexico, 
Negrete spent his early child- 
hood in Texas, where his fam- 
il) were migrant farm work- 
ers. He spent his school years 
in the steelworker culture of 
South Chicago. 

He currently resides in 
Chicago with his wife and two 
young sons. 

Negreie has taught class- 
es in education, Latino 



Studies. musicolog&gt; and mul- 
ticultural humanities at 
Indiana University -Gary, 
Roosevelt University in 
Chicago, the Chicago City 
Colleges and the University of 
Illinois. 

He has degrees from the 
University of Illinois at 
Chicago and Chicago State 
University. 

Negrete was a visiting lec- 
turer in musicolog)' at the 
University of California at 
Berkeley and he contributed 
to the university library a 
compendium of l&gt;Tics and tra- 
ditional "corridos," running- 
verse ballads that might oth- 
erwise have been lost. 

For these efforts, he was 
awarded an honorarj- Ph.D. 
by the University's 
Department of Ethnic Studies. 

He is the founder and 
director of the Mexican 
Cultural Institute of Chicago, 
which is dedicated to the 
stud) of Mexican-American 



musicology, Chicano folklore 
and culture, educational 
anthropolog}' and the social 
problems of Mexican- 
American communities. 

. Hailed as "a magical per- 
son" and as an entertainer 
"who can raise his audience to 
tremendous levels of emo- 
tion," Negrete has been the 
subject of se\'eral videos. 

He has received numer- 
ous arts fellowships and 
awards, including 
Smithsonian Institution grants 
to develop multimedia pro- 
grams on "Images of Mexican 
Labor" and "Mexican Women 
and Their Music."

UNFORTUNATEI^ TfflS IS WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
PUTTING TOO MANY RETIREMENT DOLLARS. 



Every year, a lot of people maJte a 
huge mistake on their taxes. 
They wind up sending Uncle Sam 
money they could be saving for 
retirement. 

Fortunately, that's a mistaJteyou 
can avoid with SRAs— tax-deferred 
annuities from TIAA-CREF. SFtAs not 
only ease your current tax bite, they 
offer an easy way to build retirement . 
income — especially for the "extras" 
that your pension and Social Security 
benefits may not cover. Because your 
contributions are made in pretax 
dollars, you pay less in taxes now. And 
since earnings on your SRAs are tax 



deferred, your money works even 
harder for you. 

Today, we offer other before- and 
after-tax financial solutions, including 
IRAs and mutual funds. They're 
backed by the same investment exper- 
tise, low expenses, and personal 
service that have made TIAA-CREF 
the choice of America's educational and 
research community. 

Why write off the chance for a 
more rewarding retirement? Stop by 
your benefits office or call us at 
1 800 842-2776 and find out how 
TIAA-CREF SRAs can help you enjoy 
happier returns.

Cinderella look-alikes found at March Ball 



Upsets /\ higmligmt in the first two rounds 



by Matt Scheer, 

Staff Writer 

This NCAA Tournament has 
been the mosi unpredictable in 
recent memory, with the exception 
of the outcome. 

The most intriguing stories from 
the first two rounds are always the 
upsets. The term "Cinderella" is 
thrown around with reckless 
abandon. 

I prefer ihe term underdog as 
opposed to Cinderella because you 
can't have eight Cinderellas in the 
sweet sixteen. 

Seven of the remaining sixteen 
teams are seeded P6 or lower, and 
#5 Iowa has not advanced to the 
third round in the 90s. To my cred- 
it, I did pick the Hawkeyes and 
Alford's Southwest Missouri St. to 
make it to the sweet sixteen, but I 
also picked the Hoosiers over St. 
John's. 

The fort&gt;-eighih game in four 
days was punctuated b&gt;' #10 seed 
Purdue pulling off the upset over the 
#2 seed Universitj' of Miami. 

Under normal circumstances, 
-that would have been the upset of 
the tourney, except that two other 
#10 seed's knocked of tl's. 
Gonzaga's win over Stanford and 
Miami of Ohio defeating Utah dam- 
aged both of my brackets and my 



credibility after I predicted each to 
advance deep into the tournament. 

So how do your brackets look? 
Additional surprises include Florida, 
Temple, and Oklahoma. Sure the 
upsets are fun to watch, but are they 
good for the remainder of the tour- 
nament? 

1 would have to say no. It's nice 
to see the lesser knowns getting 
some recognition, but the clock is 
bound to run out on them. Their 
presence only makes it easier for the 
top teams to advance, and the 
matchups are now much less com- 
pelling. 

I love the upsets as much as 
anjone, and you can't blame the 
underdogs for winning, but 1 would 
rather see the top teams challenged 
before they get to the Final Four. 

For example, after Duke rolls 
through Steve Alford's squad, they 
will dismantle the winner of 
Temple/Purdue. It will be interesting 
10 see how they respond if they are 
in a close game. 

Iowa has a slim chance to beat 
UConn but the Florida/Gonzaga win- 
ner has none. Kentucky and 
Michigan State should meet in the 
Midwest Regional Final, but that 
looks like the onl&gt;' potentially great 
game in that half of the bracket. 

The South Regional is the only 
quadrant where all four teams have 



a legitimate chance to make the Final 
Four. It is no coincidence that 
Auburn. Maryland, St. John's and 
Ohio State are the region's top four 
seeds. 

The term paritj' is often used in 
reference to this year's college bas- 
ketball field, except for Duke, of 
course. 

I think mediocrity is more 
appropriate. Teams are not together 
long enough to develop the continu- 
itj necessary to become perennial 
powerhouses. 

Underclassmen jumping to the 
NBA at a record clip have watered 
down the talent pool in college 
hoops. 

I can't imagine Weber State 
beating North Carolina with Carter 
and Jamison, or Arizona losing to 
Oklahoma with Mike Bibby running 



Minnesota to a championship as a 
Golden Gopher, not a Timberwolf. 
Then again, a certain secretary 
might have spilled the beans on the 
eve of the Final Four. 

One other facet of the tourna- 
ment that has become increasingly 
annoying is the television coverage 
by CBS. Usually they do a great job 
of covering the tournament, but this 
year it is obvious that greed has 
reared its ugly head. 



In year? past, CBS has shown the 
fans the final minutes of a close 
game instead of a blowout. 

When lU was up by twent)' over 
George Washington ihey showed the 
game in its entiret&gt;- instead of 
switching to Detroit upsetting UCLA. 
Eventually they did show the final 
seconds of the Weber State-North 
Carolina game, but onlj' because the 
lU game was over. 

I've seen a handful of other 
games where the outcome was clear- 
ly decided, &gt; et CBS would not switch 
until the game was completely over, 
and by then there was less than a 
minute left. 

What is worse is watching these 
blowouts while they flash the scores 
of the close games every few min- 
utes, meanwhile I'm screaming, 
"Show us the other game!" 

The network claims the fans in 
their respective regions want to 
watch the whole game, and I under- 
stand the regional angle, but no true 
basketball fan would rather watch 
their team winning by twenty than a 
possible *I4 seed upsetting #3, 

The truth is that DirecTV, which 
has a contract with CBS to show all 
of the games in the first three 
rounds, does not want the fans to see 
any games other than the regional 
coserage. 

If they do, there is no incentive 



for fans to buy the package. The 
package itself is nearly S40 for the 
first three rounds. By the Elite Eight 
there is no overlap in game times 
and the package is irrelevant. CBS 
and DirecTV are obviously in bed 
together, &gt;et Joe Fan is the one who 
gets screwed. If you disagree, 1 ask 
you. what happened to the split 
screen? I have not seen it once this 
tournament. 

I know I come off as a cynic, 
but the business of sports is slowly 
killing off the average fans. The 
NCAA Tournament is my favorite of 
all the sports championships. 1 like 
college hoops enough that I'll go to a 
sports bar to watch the games that 
are not on, but not ever&gt;'one will. 

I watched the Lewis-Holyfield 
debacle at a sports bar. I don't know 
who got ripped off more, Lennox 
Lewis or the fans. Actuallj', the fans 
did, because Lewis still got millions, 
and will get millions more in the 
rematch. Watching the fight though, 
I wondered, how long until the Super 
Bowl, Final Four and other major 
events are pay-per-view. 

My guess is. ten years at the 
most First it became too expensive 
to attend these events. Soon we'll 
have to pay jusc to watch them on 
television. The problem is that as 
long as fans shell out the cash this 
evoludon will continue

Baseball Preview '99 



by Ben Ruble, 
Slaff Writer 



During the off-season, a 
number of player shuffles 
occurred. Teams like the 
Baltimore Orioles and New 
York Mets will rise to power 
while a team like last year's 
National League champions, 
the San Diego Padres, will fall 
to disgrace. 

The New York Mcls »vill 
provide a major challenge to 
the consistent powerhouse 
Atlanta Braves, these division 
rivals could be the two best 
teams in the National t-cague. 

The Mets signed former 
Chicago White Sox Gold Glove 
Award Winner Robin Ventura 
and Major League Baseball's 
career stolen base leader, 
Rickej Henderson. 

The Los Angeles Dodgers 
have the potential to be better 
than the Mets, but not the 
Braves. 

The Dodgers, a.k.a. a 
minor part of the FOX Group, 
signed or traded to land a 
couple of kej players. New 
owner Rupert Murdoch land- 
ed pitching ace Kevin Brown 
by giving him a seven-year 
SIOS million contract. 

He also signed center- 
fielder Devon White and 
catcher Todd Hundley. Jeff 
Shaw was also signed to fill 
the closer's role. 

The Braves will again be 
great. The Braves picked up a 
few new players, Including 
Bret Boone. 

Greg Maddux, Tom 



Glavine, and John Smoltz are 
still anchoring the best pitch- 
ing staff in the game. 

With an explosive offense 
lead by R)an Klesko, Chipper 
Jones and Andruw Jones 
should lead the Braves to the 
playoffs once again. 

The best division in base- 
ball is the American League 
East.. 

This division's power 
comes from the New York 
Yankees, Baltimore Orioles, 
Toronto Blue Jays, and the 
Boston Red Sox. 

The Orioles and Blue jays 
should be the toughest chal- 
lengers to the dominant 
Yankees team, but don't count 
out the "Bo Sox." 

The Yankees traded 
pitcher David Wells, and a few 
other players, to the Toronto 
Blue Jays for stellar pitcher 
Roger Clemens. 

His consistency will add a 
huge boost to an alreadj' great 
pitching staff that includes 
such pitchers as David Cone 
and Andy Pettitte. Derek 
Jeter, Bernie Williams, Paul 
O'Neil and most of the 
Yankee's offense will return 
for the season. 

The Baltimore Orioles 
picked up Albert Belle, Delino 
DeShield^, Mike Timlin. Rick&gt; 
Bones, and Will Clark during 
the off-season. 

Belle and Clark will pro- 
vide a huge offensive boost. 
Last year. Belle hit 48 home- 
runs for the White Sox and 
Clark batted over .300 for the 
Texas Rangers. 

Pitching seems to be the 



problem with this team. The 
Orioles added relievers Timlin 
and Bones to the weak pitch- 
ing staff. 

It is likely that the 
Cleveland Indians will be of 
the same caliber as the 
Yankees. 

Roberto Alomar was 
signed to play second base for 
"The Tribe." Alomar is a great 
defensive player. Alomar can 
noiv play alongside shortstop 
Omar Vizquej, catcher and 
older brother Sandy Alomar, 
Jr., third baseman Travis 
Fryman, and first baseman 
Jim Thome. 

Many baseball fans, 
including mjself, think this is 
the best infield in the game. 

The American League 
West will be the weakest divi- 
sion. This division, in my 
opinion, is up for grabs. The 
division will likel&gt;' produce no 
true contenders and should 
be bounced in the ptajoffs. 

The Indians and Yankees 
will be the teams to watch. 
Cleveland's pitching is not 
spectacular, but it is decent. 
If their awesome offense and 
defense can work . with 
mediocre pitching, then they 
can make it to the Series. 

If e\'en one thing goes 
wrong for Cleveland, expect 
the Yankees to go to the 
Series. 

The National League 
opponent in the World Series 
will probably be the Braves. 
The Adant^ Braves are a great 
team, but I don't think it will 
be their year. 



IPFW hires new Athletic Director 



by Brian Miller, 
Spoils Editor 



IPfW has announced the 
appointment of Walter 
Bowman as the new Director of 
Athletics. 

Bowman brings a positive 
attjtude and an impressive 
resume with him. 

Bowman, who was Athletic 
Director at Gordon College 
since 1991 and Associate 
Athletic Director at California 
State Fullerton, hopes to make 
immediate impro\emcnts. 

Bowman sajs funding is 
one of his main concerns. "I 
hope to increase funding and 
provide more opportunities 
for athletes and our 
programs." 

"I am going to see what 
we can get from the state and 
hopefully raise enough to get 
teams nice uniforms and give 
them trips to Hawaii and 
Puerto Rico," he added. 

Raising funds is a familiar 
task for Bowman who promot- 
ed 17 NCAA Division I pro- 
grams as well as coordinating 
radio and television contracts. 

The attitude and track 
record Bowman brings with 



him should have IPFW on top 
of the community soon. 

Bowman said he likes to 
be more of a builder than a 
maintainer. 

He has started three pro- 
grams from scratch and feels 
veo' confident here at IPPA'. 

"Butch (Perchan) has 
brought this program a long 
way and has done things that I 
couldn't do. 

"Now it is my turn to do 
things that he couldn't do and 
hopefully turn this program 
around." 

Bowman understands the 
importance of basketball in 
the state of Indiana and will be 
evaluating resumes that are 
coming in ever^- da)' for each 
of the open coaching 
vacancies. 

"Arnie (Ball) has done a 
great job with the volleyball 
program and that is wh&gt; peo- 
ple come out and support 
them," Bowman said. "There 
is no reason the basketball 
teams and the baseball teams 
should not have that kind of 
success as with any of our 
sports." 

Bowman has visions of 
improvement within the next 



"If we have not improved 
within a year, of course I will 
be disappointed. Hopefully 
with a talented staff and goals 
all in place, success should 
follow." 

Looking at Bowman's 
goals is a lot like looking at a 
Christmas list. How many of 
these are realistic? 

"If they weren't realistic, I 
wouldn't be here right now 
and neither would the coach- 
es," Bowman believes. "We 
have good athletes and good 
programs. We are just a step 
away from getting "over the 
hump' and as soon as we do 
that I think people will come 
out and support our team!" 

"We are the universitj' of 
Fort Wayne. 

"We.have a lot to offer the 
communit)' and the communi- 
ty has a lot to offer us. 

"If we work together there 
should be no limitations to 
what this program can do," 
Bowman said. 

"Come and back us and 
we'll earn your respect. We'll 

make it fun forjou."
