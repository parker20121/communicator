Sign to replace banner advertising on campus 



The new clecironic lign has been 
Inilallcd on campus; however, ii Is noi 
ycr funcOonlng. Acrording lo Gregoo' 
Juiticc, construcilon projoci rruinager of 
the Phyilcal Planl, Uie ilgn Is "an elyc- 
tronlc marquee that will allmv Inrorma- 
tlon 10 be given to the students. ' The 
sign will also display time and 
temperature. 

According to Justice, planning for 
the sign began last fall and installation 
began Just after Christinas, The project 
cost SSO.OOO and the funds for the elec- 
tronic sign came from general universlt&gt;- 
operating funds. 

The purpose of the electronic sign is 
to relay information concerning stu- 
dents. "We've been concerned about 
how lo gel messages out to campus folks 
about a lot of dllTerent events and things 
going on around campus," said Vice 
Chancellor of Financial Affairs Walt 

According to Branson, there were 
many dilTerent possible locations for the 
sign. They considered pulling It on 
Coliseum Boulevard so that people driv' 
Ing by would sec it. They also considered 
InsialllnE the sign In the Gates area for 



athletic e\-enis. 

Branson said they llnally decided lo 
Install the electronic sign in the area 
between the Classroom Medical Building 
and Hclmkc Ubraj)- because of its cen- 
tral location. 'The conclusion we came to 
was thai the best place to put something 
like that Is across the cenual pedestrian 
court on campus because there are so 
many people walking up and down there 
all day long and Ifyou're out walking on 
campus, chances are you're going to go 
through there," said Branson, *\Ve put It 
there because of its visibility." 

According to Branson, the electronic 
sign will replace the current advertising 
system of hanging banners. "It's realty 
going to give us the chance lo be able lo 
advertise a lot of things at once instead 
of just one banner, like now,' 
Branson said. 

Also, the electronic sign will make It 
easier for organizations to advertise. 
Instead of going through the lengthy 
process of having the Physical Plant hang 
a banner, organizations who want lo 
advertise will simply submit a form and 
(he information will be programmed into 
the sign. 

Branson hopes that the sign wll! 
generate belter attendance al campus 
events. According to Justice, the sign 
should be up and running in the ne.\t 
couple of weeks.

Department of theatre to present 
comical adventure "Arcadia" 



The IPFW Department 
of Theatre presents the 
opening of ■'Arcadia" by 
Tom Stoppard, Feb. 1 1, at 8 
p.m. in Williams Theatre. 
The play also shows Feb 12, 
is and 19 at B p.m. 

According to Director 
Craig Humphrcj', "Arcadia" 
Is a comedy in which "half 
the play is set in 1809 and 
half Is set In todaj." 

The plaj- takes place on 
country estates In England. 
Through the play, we see 
that the action which occurs 
In 1B09 has repercussions 
for the characters who are 
living in todaj''5 society. 

According to 

Humphrey, this play "is 
about the nature of truth 
and how it affects relation- 
ships." It focuses on the dif- 
ference betiveen the classi- 
cal and romantic tempera' 
mcnt, and the disruptive 
influence of sex on our 
orbits In life. 

"It also deals with a lot 
of things," said Humphrej'. 
"It deals with chaos vs. 



ilcism, physics, algebra, 
literature." 

"Literature plays a 
huge role," according to 
Humphrey. "Lcird Bj'TDn is 
the central figure in the 
plaj' and he never appears. 
He Is talked about 
constantly." 

There are 12 cast mem- 
bers In the play with four 
central characters. In the 
1809 scene, the tutor and 
the daughter of the house 
are key characters. In the 
contemporao' scenes, a 
writer and a professor who 
Is doing research on Byron 

According to 

Humphrey, though, "all the 
characters that we see are 
Intimately involved In 
what's going on between the 
two time periods.* 

"Arcadia" has been In 
rehearsal since the first day 
of the semester. According 
to Humphrey, who faced the 
Incredible task of working 
as the play's director, as 
well as its costume designer, 
work on the play for him 

"It's been both enjoy- 
able and really Irustrating," 



"It's 



fru 



ting 

because It has been an 
Incredible burden on my 
time, but what's good about 
it Is I know exactly what I 
want and so t can produce 
that for myself." 



Hu 



ircy 



hopes patrons will find this 
play amusing. "1 find the 
play terrible funny," he 
said. "It ii a comedy of man- 
ners; it Is very wittj' and It 
requires that the audience 
pays attention." 

"We really focused on 
not getting lost in all the 
stuff that's in there; the 
algebra, the physics and the 
literature, and we focused 
on playing the people as the 
people," said Humphrey. 

The play was also verj' 
challenging because of the 
nature of the set. "The play 
calls for the only furniture 
in the room to he a uble 
and a chair," he said. 



challenging." 

Overall, Humphrey 
hopes that audiences will 
enjoy this play and find it 
as amusing as he has. For

Open screening for eating disorders 
to offer confidential assistance 



Eatin 



vlth 



On Thursday, Feb. 17. IPFW will be 
hosting Eating Disorders Screening Day 
from 11 a.m. to 7 p,n^ at the Walb Student 
Union, Room G21. The event will Include 
screenings, as well as presentations by a 
doctor and a dietician. This c\'cnt is being 
sponsored by the IPFW Center for Women 
and Returning Adults, IPFW Wellness 
and Parkview Behavioral Health. 

According. to Judy Tlllapaugh, R.D., 
IPFW wellness/fltness coordinator, 'It's 
very Important to offer this opportunity to 
our communltj' and campus. Ealing disor- 
ders affect more than 5 million Americans 
and It Is especially hurtful to our joung 
adults. It's a dangerous mental Illness 
because If It Is not treated. It can lead to 
serious problems." 

According to Tlllapaugh, "The screen- 
ing Is completely confidential and is not 
Intended to provide a diagnosis, but rather 
help guide people to effecdvc assistance. 
When they come to the screening, they'll 
have the opporcunltj to fill out a simple 
screening form and after they complete the 
form, thej-'ll have the chance to meet one- 
on-onc with a mental health professional. 
From that, the person can be given Infor- 
mation that can help them get additional 

There will also be a question and 
answer session with Kevin Murphy. M.D., 
medical director of Parkview 
Behavioral Health from noon to I p.m. and 



Registered Dietician Ann Reidenbach. 

According to Tlllapaugh, eating disor- 
den are a mental disorder. 

"If a person has an eating disorder. It Is 
a sign that there are other mental struggles 
going on. Manj' times a person with an eat- 
ing disorder has a history of abuse or a his- 
lorj' of some major strcssrul changes or 
they have had some previous addictions. 
The eating disorder they have is a symptom 
to some other undcrljing problems." said 
Tlllapaugh. 

According to the American Dietetic 
Association, there arc three recognized eat- 
ing disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia 
nervosa and b i n ge eating disorder. 
Anore.xla is characterized by starving one- 
self to the point of cttiaciadon. Bulimia Is 
characterized by cjcles of blnging and 
purging, as well as dlcdng and compulsive 
overeating Is characieriied by cycles of 
overeating. 

According to The American Dietetic 
Association, eating disorders usually devel- 
op between the ages of 12 and ZS- 

According to Tillapaugh, the Eadng 
Disorders Screening Day would be a good 
opportunltj', not Just for individuals who 
believe they might have an eating disorder. 
but for friends and family members who 
are worried about a loved one. 

"It may be that people out there know 
a friend or reladve who may have an eating 
disorder, but they don't know what to do or 
they don't know how to help that person. 
By coming to the screening Ihiiy can find 
out how to help the person that they love.'

A cry for new elevators in Walb 




On Tuesday, iomeone gol trapped i 
one of the elevaiorj in Walb Student 
Union for approximately Tive [o ten min- 
uies, according to Dave Danlclson, direc- 
tor of the Physical PlanL The elevator wai 
not leveling and the doon would not 
open. (Everyone in the building heard the 
alarim go off.) Someone came to look at 
the situation and a problem could not be 
found, said Danlclson. The incident hap- 
pened again on Wednesday and someone 
was supposed lo look at it again later in 
the day. We sec a problem. 

According to Danielson before these 
recent incidents there have not been any 
problems with tlie elevators in Walb. 
However, ive use the elevators almost 
c\'eryday and Tind the elevators lo be slow 
moving. A little over a year ago. a member 
of our staff was trapped ror4S minutes. 

The student union was constructed in 
1973. It Is 27 years old and so are the ele- 
\ators. They have never been replaced. 



There isn't even a 'close door" button. 

Danielson said the elevators In 
Ketller were replaced two years ago and 
the passenger ele\'aiors in the library will 
be replaced soon. These are the worst ele- 
vators, according to Danielson, and the 
other elevators on campus aren't too bad. 

On several occasions, different siaiT 
members have witnessed minor problems 
on the ele\-alors in the library and the stu- 
dent union. You never know what floor 
you may arrive on. 

In addition to arriving on an unex- 
pected floor, a person's schedule could be 
hindered. One could be late to work, a 
class, an appomtment or an engagement. 
What if a person could not walk down tile 
stairs and had lo use the elevators? There 
arc endless problems that could arise. 

The elc\'3iars In Walb are unreliable. 
They should be updated or replaced. For 
now, we are using the stairs and suggest 
you do the same. 



Technology affects all 



As people

ring In iechnolog&gt;'. There truly is some- 
thing of a technological re\'olution occur- 
ring in the country and the world. 

However, what 1 do not suspect peo- 
ple fully-rcalize Is that the same is true 
with regard id- technological innovation 
useful for espionage purposes. It is my 
view that world espionage organizations 
now have technological capabilities that 
allow them to demonstrate more power in 
influencing the affairs of societies than 
ever before in history. 

All the secret satellites regularly 
being sent up Into space likely allow world 
espionage organizations increased powcn 
to control societies. I suspect many of Uie 
technologies present on these satellites 
would shock people with regard to how 
powerful they are In inlluendng events on 

One technology I belieii-e is currently 
present on earth is a technology called. 



'Mind Control Technology." I believe this 
technology is now developed to such a 
degree that the CIA and other world espi- 
onage organizations can Influence the 
thought processes in people's minds. 
Consequently, I suspect these organiza- 
tions can di'amatically Influence the out- 
comes of elections in supposedly free 

I feel the public should be made more 
aware of these possibilities. It seems that 
the United Stale's news providing indus- 
tries have been unusually silent with 
regard to reporting on the state-of-the-art 
technological capabilities of espionage 
organizatlpns. 

I also suspect It Is no longer safe to 
watch television or listen to the radio 
without risking being unknowingly Influ- 
enced in views and attitudes. 

Sincerely.

Assist your fellow human 



by Chadd Pierce, Staff Writer 

On the Aerosmlth album *Cet 
A Crip,* there is a song called 
'living on the Edge" whose iyriC! 
begin with: "There's something 
wrong with Iheworid today. I don't 
know what it is.,." This Is a power- 
ful song on a CD that has little else 
to offer (sorry fans, but it is true). 
It talks about various ugly prac- 
tices and has a great sound too. 
This is NOT, however, a column 
praising Aemsmith. I think their 
older stuff Is belter anyway. This Is 
what I would like to call a 'Cliche 
Writing," Why? It is about some- 
thing very important, but the word 
that describes It in the English lan- 
guage has become overused and 
abused, "Peace," Societal peace is 
the topic for now. 

1 suppose I should have gone 
even further to ivrite 'the lack 
ihereor up there because that is 
what I think we are suffering from

Well, they have always been 
there, but nationally and even 
locally, I believe that the focus on 
this Idea has ceased without 
nature, God or any other religious, 
spiritual or just plain common 
sense force approving first. I have 
brought this up with some of my 
family and friends and they all |ust

are plenty of people bent on mak- 
ing the world a more peaceful 
place. Great! 1 never said there 
were not. Unfortunately, one could 
see a hundred people in a crowded

that ONE person, they are. If you

Man with the mike: It's so hard to say goodbye 



by Brian Miller. Advertising Manager 
This being my farewell column, 
there are a lot of things I would like to 
cover. First off, I would like to share 
with you some very important tips for 
being successful here on campus. 

11 Get called. Get Involved. Sure 
it's the slogan used by IPRV Athletics, 
but it's the essential of making the 
most of your lime here at IPFVV. 

2) Talk 10 someone neiv every day. 
It is hard enough meeting people here 
on campus, so why make it any harder 
by hiding in a shell? 

3) Get to know those you admire. 
That is something that I have prided 
myself on and will come hack to. 

4) Go to events and take advan- 
tage of campus services. SAB performs 
things for free all of the time. They 
bring in some of the greatest campus 
entertainment in the country, so go 
check that out) 

Also, the Writing Center. 
Transitional Studies and out-of&lt;lass 
testing are great services 
times go unused. Please don' 
through school noi using those fine 
facilities. 

5) Co to an IPFW athletic evenL It 
Is a very Important part of college and 
It would be my dream lo some day see 
a sign outside on the ticket window 
saying SOLD OUT. Ufs make that 



happen! 

The next few things I would like to 
address are my "thank you's," The first 
place I would like to start is here at The 
Communicator. Tlie fint week of my 
freshman year, I applied for Sports 
Editor and got It. Ifs something that 1 
have been very proud of.. The 
Communicator is a great way to get 
established and I highly recommend 
the opportunity to everyone. 

Secondly. I would like to send out 
a huge Thank You card to IPFW 
Athletics. Mike Jewell and Ron Clark 
have pro\'ided me with a plethora of 
information the last two years and 
have both allowed me to pursue my 
lo%'c of sports and IPFW athletics in 



other areas. For that, t will always be 
grateful. 

To the coaching staff, there wasn't 
a time when you wouldn't sit down and 
talk with me and I appreciate ihaL 
Thank you for all of your cooperation 
and you arc not only a role model to 
your players, but to me as well and 1 
mean that! I would also like lo thank 
Athletic Director Walt Bowman for tak- 
ing time to get to know me and for all 
of the guidance and encouragement he 
has given to me throughout the past 

As I was saying earlier, get to know 
those you admire. I'll he honest, as a

This year 1 have had the privilegi 
of spending time in class with Jamit

my boys. Josh Hocppner and Justin

you off another farewell article. These 
two have pushed me to where 1 am

Appreciating 
the aspects 
of family 

by Nathan Ericson, Staff Writer 

I have been doing a great 
deal of thinking about family 
since I moved out a few months 
ago. 

I have always been a family 
guy. I loved to do things with my 
family. I realized as a young 
child that they were the ones 
that were going to be there for 
me through thick and thin, and 
thai I could count on them for 
anythhig, 

I fought with my three 
younger brothers, but that Is 
normal. They are my buddies 
now, and we get along real well, I 
also remember fighting with my 
parents. 1 didn't see the impor- 
tance of doing homework before 
going out to play. Being realistic 
though, what kid ever docs! They 
also had this stupid rule about if 
you were sick and didn't go to 
school, then you couldn't go out 
and play after the official school 
time was over. 1 didn't like that 
cither, but I lived with it. 

As 1 stated earlier, I moved 
out a a few months ago, and 
since then I haven't been 
exposed to the little things that 
come wlih a big family. (There 
are six of us.) t miss the jokes and 
things that go on, 1 miss the little 
sayings that come about because 
somebody does something stupid 
and they get teased. Then Ihe 
nickname sticks for awhile until 
somebody else does something 
stupid an and then they get 
branded. 

My piece of the chain has 
been pulled awaj-. I am off on my 
own to make my own stories and 
to have my oiwn mishaps with my 

One thing that 1 have come 
to realize is that family never 
goes away. M&gt;- brothers love to 
come over to my house and 
hang ouL They love to play with 
the cats. They love to waich 
movies and hang out with their 
"big brother." I asked them the 
other day when they were over 
at my house if they were bored. 
(1 had been working on my 
homework.) They replied, "No 
way. It's cool just to be over 
here." They have spent the night, 
and 1 have picked them up to do 
ihings with them. Even though 1 
sometimes miss the teasing and 
the total chaos that went on with 
six schedules all being different, 
the relationship 1 have with my 
family now is one that I cherish 
just as much. 

One of the relationships that 
means a great deal to mc is the 
relationship that I have with my 
mom. She Is also a student here 
at IPFW. Ifwe continue the same 
way that we are, w'c will graduate 
at the same time, I think that 
would be something pretty neat 
and special . My mom and I go 
out to lunch on occasion and 
have wonderful discussions 
about the things in our lives. Of 
course she pays because I am 
just a poor college student, but 
she never forgets to give me 
some good advice. 

1 also get along real well with 
my dad. He is my dad, but he is 
also my friend. I know that 1 can 
call him at any time lo talk with 
him, 1 know that he understands 
m e and the way that I think. My 
mom understands me as well, 
but it is just different when it Is a 
man, and he is your dad. I will 
always sit with him when he Is 
watching my brothers play soc- 
cer and we have wonderful talks 
about pretty much anything. 

The point of all of this is 
that the next week Is Valentine's 
Day. This is a day for that special 
someone In your life, but I don't 
think that we should ever forget 
the very special people who have 
brought us through life. For me ii 
has been my parents and broth- 
ers. For others it may be an aunt 
or uncle, or grandparent, but I 
think that we need to remember 
them just as much as we remem- 
ber that other special someone. 

Why not call them up and 
wish them a happy Valentine's 
Day. It just nUghi be what they 
arc looking u&gt; hear.

Fort Wayne meets the X-Files at UFO lecture 



With ihe Hlsioo' Channel 
running "UfOs, Then and 
Now?- all laii week and lut 
Saiurda/j UFO lecmre at the 
AJIen County Library down- 
(own. Fort Wayne citizens are 
sure getting a iot of Informa- 
tion about our llllie friends 
from space. 

At the lecture, speaker 
Roger Sudgem of MUFON, or 
Mutual UFO Network, Inc., dis- 
cussed in depth UFO sightings 
throughout history, including 
recent e%'ents sucli as Roswell 
and Operation Blue Book. 

"People say that this UFO 
thin^ is l&lt;ind of new. starting In 
1947," said Sudgem, "but 
that's the modern era. 
Throughout history, going way 



back thousands of yean... 
there are accounts of 
sightings.- 

After giving a general 
overview, Sudgem then went 
on to show a slide presenta- 
tion. This Included pictures of 
UFOs, crop circles and other 



well a 



ings of aliens and other space- 
crafts. These slides had both 
local photos, as well as pictures 
from England and elsewhere 

Surprisingly, the Fort 
Wayne area has had quite a 
number of UFO sighdngs and 
crop eirdei. On July 13, 1993, 
two, UEOs were spotted by 
many different people and 
later that day, two crop circles 
in the same vicinlt)' of the 
sightings appeared. Though 
Sudgem says the relationship 



between the two anomalies 
isn't ceraln. he thinks there's 
derinllely a link. 

"Crop circles have had a 
long connection with UFO 
activity," said Sudgem. "That's 
not to say that UFOs make crop 
circles. There are lots of myste- 
rioiu things about crop circles. 
Nobody knows who makes 
them, hut there arc all kinds of 
theories." 

Between sLientific findings 
and other facts about the for- 
mation of crop circles, Sudgem 
infers that even though their 
sources are yet unknown, 
they arc ver&gt;' importanL The 
idea. that something either nat- 
ural or alien could create these 
complicated designs is some- 
thing that Interests many 

Locally, Syracuse. 



Columbia Clt&gt;- and Aboite 
Township have the most 
unusual, possibly even alien 
events. Sudgem links this con- 
centration to the fact that 
there are Native American bur- 
ial grounds around both 
Columbia City and Aboite. 
"Crop circles have been known 
to be close to religious 
fites/anclent burial sites," 
Sudgem said. 

Whatever the cause, 
according to Sudgem some sort 
of paranormal activities are 
taking place right here In Fort 
Wayne's back&gt;-ard. 

MUFON Is devoted to 
research, and collection of 
items connected to UFOs and 
related occurrences. This 
group Is made up of both pri- 
vate citkiens and expert con- 
sultants and field researchers. 



Much like S.ET.I, Search 
for Extr^-Terres trial Life, a 
well-known scientific organiza- 
tion, MUFON alio takes an 
interest in finding out whether 
humans arc alone in Ihc 
galaxy. Unlike S.ET.I, however. 
MUFON investigates encoun- 
ters and sightings, rather than 
waiting for communication 
and e.xtra terrestrial radio 
transmissions. 

The audience for this lec- 
ture surprisingly consisted 
mostly of people that say ihej' 
have witnessed UFO sightings. 
All were from the Fort Waj-ne 



and surrounding areas and 
seemed convinced of what 
they had seen— alien air crafts. 
"Throughout history' there 
have been many accounts of 
UFOs. . . and aliens," said 
Sudgem, "as flying shields . . .

'Bicentennial Man': Man versus machine 



Man," directed by Chris 
Columbus, is based on a 
short storj- by Issac 



The film offers a 
light examination of 
what it means to be 
human. At its center 
stands Andrew (Robin 
VVllliams encased In a 
suit created by special 
effects company, "XFX"), a 
robot of the future, 
built and designed as a 
luxunous househokl appli- 
ance, whose capabliiiies 
ewrecd Its cnatoTs' and Its 
CDitsumetV expectations. 

When Mr. Martin 
(Sam Neill) surprises his 
wife (Wendy Crew son) 
and his two daughters 
(Hallie Kate Elsenberg 



and Undze Lethcrman) 
with his newly-ac(]uireil 
robot, the family's 
mixed reactions threat- 
en the "intruder's" pos- 
sibillty of being 

The theme which 
prevails throughout the 
entire film about the 
need to be accepted 
becomes Andrew's main 

He learns from 
books. Imitating human 
behaviors and through- 
out the years from his 
life-long friendship with 
the most caring daugh- 
ter of the Martin famiij'. 
Andrew develops an 
ldentit&gt;-, seeks out an 
expert android designer 
[Oliver Piatt) and 
embarks on a journey of 
total transformation. 

Tlie movie draws 
most of its humor from 
the protagonist's clum- 
sy unfamlllarlty with 
human ways and its 



Andrew's discovery of 
the meaning of love, 
freedom and happiness. 
The most intrigu- 
ing and most developed 
aspect involves the por- 
ira&gt;-al of a society of 
humans who resist full 

humanized robot. 

'Bicentennial Man" 
succeeds in entertaining 
the viewer on a visual 
level by putting aside 
unfamiliar Images (a 
robot alongside a little 
girl at the beach or 
pla&gt;ing the piano). 

Unfortunately, the 
movie often relies too 
heavilj' on the inconse- 
quential silliness which 
ensues from the robot's 
simplistic and transpar- 
ent manner of commu- 
nicating with the 
complex and fallible 
humans: a choice which

The second semester Is well 
on its way. Do you know what 
that means? It means 
IntTsmurals are about to begin, 
so It's dme to gel those compet- 
itive juices flowing. 

"We are trying to rejuve- 
nate this program," said first 
year Intramurals organizer J, 
Webb Horton. 

Intramui^s, which is a pop- 
ular student pastime at most 
universities, has suffered due to 
lack of stutlent participation in 
the past few years. 

■Last semester, we had six 
volleyball teams, but we only 
had two or three basketball 
teams," Horton said. 

TTiis Is not an Impressive 
statistic, considering IPFW has 
nearly 13,000 students. 

Students that often want to 
get Involved at school, or just 



need a break from the every day 
study life could use this pro- 
gram as a relief from that 

"We are trying to make an 
offering lo the student body so 
that they have something other 
to do, rather than Just hit the 
books," said Horton, who is also 
IPFWs men's and women's len- 

The deadline to have team 
entries is Friday, Feb. 11. Upon

Thursday, Feb. 17. Basketball 
and volleyball captaii 
3 p.m. and racquetball partici- 
pants meet at 3;30 p.m. 

If you never had the abllltj' 
to compete at the college level, 
try competing at the college stu- 
dent level. Who knows, you 
might Just make some good col- 
lege memories and a few friends

2000 men's tennis 
season begins 




After a disappointing '99 
campaign, men's tennis coach 
]. Webb Honon and tlie tennis 
team hope to rebound for their 
finl season of the millennium. 

"I was a little disappoint- 
ed with last year's (S-lOj per- 
formance," Coach Horton 
explains. 

'It was one of those 
would have, could have, 
should have situadons," 
he said, "but we've 
learned from those mis- 
takes and that makes us 
stronger." 

1999 was a tough 
year for the Dons' ten- 
nis team. The positives 
are that most of the 



Ing season are Jason Ganiolle, 
Rj'an Perzanowski, 7.ach Harl, 
Ozzle MItson, Shaun Fisher, 
Khalecl All and David Wade.

"As (Jason) goes, so we go,

"Ryan Perzanowski has

"I watch Shaun [Fisher)

Preview to men's basketball vs. 
#3 Kentucky Wesleyan 



by ]J Craig, 
Sports Edilor 



The lasi time the Dons 
looked at this Kentucky 
Wesle&gt;'an team was earlier this 
year. The Dons didn't like 
whai they jaw. 

On Jan. IS, IPFW visited 
13 Kentucky Wcslejan's home 
lurf In Ownesburg, Ky. It was 
not a warm welcome. The Dons 
got tossed around in a lough 
87-108 losj to Kentucky 
Wesleyan. 

Now Kentucky Wcslej-an 
hopes to complete the season 
sweep against IPFW here in the 
Trlendly eonHnes oT Gates 
Sports Center. 

The Dons have one thing 
. on their mind... upset. 

*Wc were lucky enough to 
■ come off a decent road trip, 
which we iplit 2-2," IPFW 
atketball coach Doug 



"They attack the 
glass... We can't 
give up second 

chance points..."

Leroy John. They combined for 
48 points and 24 rebounds

Both John and Richardson

Men's volleyball team 
bounces back 



Atiemptlng to recover 
from a disappointing showing 
at the Hawaii Invitational, the 
Volleydons went on a brief 
road trip. Brief is the key word. 
In tu'o matches, the Dons did 
not drop a single game. 

In their first match, IPFW 
traveled lo Mercjhurst College 
(6-3, 1-3 MIVA) in what turned 



obeni 



15-7. 

They were led by Hector 
Soto's 24 kills and Chris 
Gisslen continued his furious 
pace with 43 assists, 

IPFW then traveled to take 
on Penn State in what was a 
grudge match for the Dons. 

Two weeks ago, Penn State 
beat IPFW in four games, but 
the Volleydons were there to 
let the Nittany Uons know that 
it would not happen again. 

Different score from last 



match, different results. 

The Dons wanted to show 
PSU that the last match was in 
fact a fluke. They swept Penn 
Slate in three straight games, 
IS-IO, 15-6 and lS-13. 

Leading the way for the 
Dons were Scott Line and Jeff 
Ptak, with 21 kills each and 
Gisilen with S9 assists. 

So far so good for Josh 
Sanders' prediction, "We won't 
lose again." 

We look forward for the 
streak lo continue.
