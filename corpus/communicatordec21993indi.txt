Chief Reporter 

Recently, IPFW sophomore Chris 
Douse joined ihe Indiana Campus 
Compact 



involved with 
several organiza- 
tions on campus. 
As a student sen- 
ator in the 



Indiana-Purdui 



serves as the 
chair of the 
Legislative 
Affairs 
Committee and 
also as treasurer 
of the Black 
Collegian 

"As the student volunteer service 
coordinator, I serve on the ICC 
Advisory Board with Mary Brant, the 
student employment coordinator." said 
Douse. 

This coalition is made up of a number 
of colleges and universities Tbe 




Indiana Campus Compact was origi- 
nally called the Indiana Consortium 
for Voluntary Service (ICVS). 
As a project of the Education 
Commission of the United States, civic 
responsibility and community involve- 
ment arc only a few of the ideals that 
the ICC tries to promote. 

This service is also 
known to allow 
students to acquire 
information and to 
develop skills that 
are needed to be an 
promising leader 
on and off campus. 
Those duties ICC 
provides for other 
students arc as fol- 
lows: mini grants, 
education training, 
conferences, and a 
development of a 
statewide student 
network. 

"What I plan to do 
is to follow up on 
the previous pro- 
ject that was in 
progress. This involves a handbook 
that contains a listing of volunteer ser- 
vices that are open in the community," 
said Douse. "I also wish to stimulate 
more campus involvement in program 
as well."

meeting. 

All executive officers were present 
as Siudem Body Presideni Rajai Suri 
called the meeting to order. 

Linda Johnson, coordinator for the 
Center for Women and Returning 
Adulls, was present. 

Suri piesented Greichen Haupert as 
ihe new Child Care Referral 
Advocate. 

Haupert fills Ihe position once held 
by Deb Deere, who was also present 
at the meeting. 

She informed IPSGA of what she 
will be doing as the new advocate. 

During a brief discussion after 
Haupert's presentation. Vice-

talk to me about It," Johnson said, from the IPSGA Bylaws. 
"The flyers are not a pan of the refer- 



ral service," 

Suri appointed Deere and Tracy 
Ruda to the Child Care Task Force. 

"I'm just not sure what I want to 
share right now," Deere said. "I feel 
strongly aboui the childcare issue and 
I plan to continue my advocacy for 
the students on this Issue." 

As of Nov. 12. 1993, Deere was no 
longer considered the child care 
advocate for IPFW due to controver- 
sial issues. 

The IPSGA went on to debate of ihe 
amendments G, H, I, and J. 

Amendment G created the Finance 
Committee which will investigate the 
expenditure of IPSGA funds and 
assist the Vice-President of Finance 
in IPSGA financial manners. 

IPSGA voted unanimously to accept 
amendment H which focused on sen- 
ate sessions, attendance of senators, 
and quorum.

Advocate for child care referral service selected 



Gretchen Haupert 
becomes new student 
liaison to university 

By F. Lane Douse 
Editor In Chief 

Monday. Linda Johnson, coordinator 
of the center for women and returning 
adults, presented Gretchen Haupert as 
the new Child Care Referral Advocate. 

Haupert, a 1993 graduate of 
Northwestern University, Evanston, HI., 
filled the position most recently held by 
Deb Deere. 

Currently, she is enrolled in school 
trying to get back into tbe college mode 
while she determines what she would 
like to major in the second time around. 

Deere no longer acted as the child care 
referral advocate since Nov. 12, 1993 
when she left the Center for Women 
and Returning Adults due to controver- 
sial issues. 

It has yet to be determined whether 
Deere was terminated, or whether she 

As the child care referral advocate, 
Haupert will be responsible for contact- 
ing child care services in the area and 
act as a liaison between tbe students 
and the University. 

"I have been kind of floating for past 
week or so because Linda has been 
sick," said Haupert. "But now that she 
is back, we are working on getting me 
organized and to a starting point." 

Haupert has begun her job by request- 
ing studies on where students come 
from to create a region for the referral 




Gretchen Haupert appears to be ready and willing to address child care issues on campus. 



"If there are people coming from 
places an hour away, there are some- 
times child care services in their area 
that will take care of their kids," 
Haupert commented. "If I can contact 
those places for the students, it will be 
convenient for the students to leave 
their children near home where rela- 
tives may be if anything would happen 

Creating a perimeter of where the stu- 
dents come from will also give her a 
framework to work within.

Haupert does not have any children, 
but knows what it is like to be a child 
with parents going back to school. 

"] remember when my father was 
going back to school when I was young, 
and I stayed at my aunt's a lot" 

Haupert is also aware of die fact that 
the job market is becoming smaller and 
more people are going back to school to 
improve their educational background. 
-Haupert decided to take the job 
because she feels there is a real need for 
childcare 



"I want to get as many references as 
possible so the service can be utilized at 
its full potential. I want to relieve as 
much stress from the parents as possi- 
ble, and this referral service can do 
that," added Haupen. 

"I empathize with the parents because 
I understand where their kids are com- 
ing from because I was one. I think if 
kids can see their parents coming home 
from school, it will empower their chil- 
dren to do the same." 



Director of mentoring program discusses role at IPFW 



Ken Coopwood 
promotes guidance 

By Felicia Beechlng 
News Editor 

Ask Ken Coopwood about volunteer- 
ing and watch bis face light up with 
pride and pleasure. 

Coopwood, a Gary, Indiana native, 
knows much about volunteers and vol- 
unteering from both: personal and pro- 
fessional perspectives. 

Professionally, Coopwood is the men- 
toring program director at Indiana- 
Purdue Fort Wayne (IPFW) 
Multicultural Services Office, a new 
project at the university. Coopwood is 
eager to speak about the IPFW 
Mentoring Program. 

"It [tbe program] was on hold for over 
a year, due to a lack of funding," said 
Coopwood. During the last few months 
the program's funding materialized and 
tbe program is now off to a running 
start. 

The purpose of the program is to pro- 
vide African -Am eric an and Hispanic 
students with 'personal, academic, and 
professional help,' according to the 
brochure Coopwood's office produced. 

"Minority students need role models 
to help them gain access to tbe job 
market after graduation," said 
Coopwood. "They also need encour- 
agement to be successful while in 

The program combines IPFW faculty 
and community mentor volunteers with 
minority students. Students of color are 
teamed with community leaders of 
color and obtain access to on IPFW 
faculty person. This triad becomes an 
academic year commitment for all 
three members. 

Coopwood describes bis job as over- 
seer of all aspects of the mentoring 
program, including recruitment of 
mentors, faculty, and students 

"Some possible mentors think that 
this is going to lake up a lot of their 




for 



whole 



Coopwood. "But that's just not so. 
Often, weekly contact is just by 
phone." 
"I hope that the friendships formed 

arc lasting ones for the parties 



involved. That can be a real asset after 
graduahon when job-hunting, especial- 
ly for minority students," said 
Coopwood. 

Minorities often have a hard time 
competing in the job market, explained 
Coopwood. He hopes to see the pro- 
gram open up a way for future gradu- 
ates to network for jobs. "Networking 
can make the difference in finding, or 
not finding a job," be said. 

Coopwood encourages people of 
color to become menlors. Two training 
sessions per semester arc offered. 
Weekly contact and a log are also 
required along with keeping in contact 

Problems do exist for the young pro- 
gram. Coopwood finds that there is a 
lack of minority menlors thai match 

"We match gender to gender, major to 
major, and we try to match by race, but 
it's not always possible." explained 
Coopwood." "We hove less than three 
percent of tbe IPFW faculty represent- 
ed by minorities." There is a waiting 
list of students waiting tormentors. 

Coopwood described the typical pro- 
file of a student who comes to him 
looking for a mentor. "Generally, a slu- 



wanting 

semester freshman, or first semester 
sophomore with a decided major. This 
student has expressed an interest in 
gaining assistance and getting to know 
a professor in the field." explained 
Coopwood. 

Students are presented with the pro- 
files of the co-mentor teams that 
Coopwood thinks would be positive 
role models. The mentee is asked to 
prioritize the list. The final selection is 
made and the triad is invited to a social 
function to become acquainted. 

Other methods are employed by 
Coopwood to get tbe ball rolling lo 
encourage mentees. Students are sent 
letters to see if they are interested in 
the program through a faculty or staff 
referral who believes that a student 
would benefit from being mentored, or 
potentially 'at risk' students are Identi- 
fied by Ihe Vice Chancellor of Student 

As the first director of" the program, 
Coopwood is very pleased with tbe 
enthusiasm of the menlors and 

'1 came to IPFW specifically lo take 

this job." said the Gary, Indiana native. 
Coopwood graduated from Indiana 



Stale University in Tcrre Haute, and 
earned a bachelor's degree in business 
administration and, in 1992, a graduate 
degree in the master of public adminis- 
tration (M.P.A.I program. 

Coopwood's professional life is just 
an extension of his personal life when 
it comes to being committed to volun- 
tecrism. He has been involved in Big 
Brothers/Big Sislers since 1988. 

"I was tbe youngest of six children, 
and I know bow important it is to have 
someone older to talk to," he said. 
"Right now I have four litUe brothers 
[through Big Brothers/Big Sisters]." 

He is also involved in summer volun- 
teer programs in Wayne Township in 
Fort Wayne. 

"I have coached summer basketball 
for two summers," said Coopwood. 

Others have noticed tbe commitment 
that Coopwood brings to whatever be 
docs. He was named Project Mentor 
Volunteer of the Year for 1992. a Big 
Brothers/Big Sisters organization. 

"I think it's important for young peo- 
ple to bave a positive person of their 
own bdL'ltg round." Coopwood said. 

When asked what bis plans for the 
future held, be smiled and said, "I'll 
just keep doing what I'm doing now."

Does lowering standards 
prepare students for college? 



"The educational system has reached 
a point in which they are digressing 
instead of progressing. " 



This is not news to any of us. Unless 
young people arc outstanding in aib- 
iciics, American schools usually 
ignore children whose abilities put 

them uncomfortably above the main- 

Yel it's progress the U. S. 

Department of Education has issued 
put o report that describes the educa- 
tion of America's gifted children as 
"dangerous" and "pathetic disgrace." 

So many American students are 
working below their potential the 
future doesn't appear to be promising 
for our nation. 

Why hasn't it occurred to anyone, 
especially our educators and our par- 
ents, that if the school systems contin- 
ue to lower the educational standards 
of the best students, we will all suffer? 

Who will continue to strive in the 
areas of engineering and science tech- 
oology or create solutions to some of 
the world's problems? 

Certainly not those who are failing 
Basic Life 101. 

The new report slated several conclu- 
sions that are difficult to accept' 

"Gifted and talented elementary 
school students have mastered from 
35 to 50 percent of (he curriculum to 
be offered in five basic subjects before 
they begin the school year." 

•"Schools permit or even foster prej- 
udice and discrimination against 
bright students, who are called 
"nerds" or "dweebs" or worse, and 
against high-achieving minority 
youngsters who are sometimes 
accused of "acting white." 

•"Bright high school students rou- 
tinely spent less then a half an hour a 
say on homework, although they get 
top grades because it requires so little 
effort. 

We should be concerned with foster- 
ing children's self-esteem at all cose, 
because it continues to hurt the brigbt- 
estchildren. Textbooks have 

been downgraded by two grade levels 
in the last 20 years - and "basic stalls" 
programs have further diluted the cur- 
riculum in hopes that fewer children 
will fail or even have to be cbal- 

Furthennorc, it is considered politi- 
cally incorrect to label youngsters as 
"gifted" and enroll them in special 
classes because it insinuates that other 
students are not so smart or special. 

According to a telephone survey con- 
ducted by tbe News-Sentinel from 
June 19 to August 11. a majority of 
adults who live in the Port Wayne 
Community Schools district say the 
quality of education is either excellent 
or good. 

When tbe adults were asked to rale 
education in comparison lo other local 
issues, residents ranked education first 
in importance by 91 percenl. 

The educational system has reached 
a point in which they are digressing 
instead of progressing. We can't allow 
this - we as students especially. 

It's affecting oil of us. Stop and think 
for a minute about when you, as a 



high school student, were back in high 
school preparing to lake the Standard 
Achievement Test. 

Don't you remember studying for it? 
Or how about tbe SAT classes or ibe 
self-help books? Did they really 
work? Were tbey necessary? 

We, as students, bad lo determine 
whether or not we were going to 
spend our time and our money for 
something that may or may not work. 

So. the educational system is falling 
apart You've got lo be kidding, you 
say, with 12 hours of work a night and 
that's only from MA 153 

No way. 

Then one bright, sunny Saturday 
morning you take tbe SATs and your 
view changes. You store at that stupid 
problem about two trains going in dif- 
ferent directions at different rates and 
wonder why didn't they just take tbe 
bus. Everyone around you seems to be 
finished and dozing. With terror in 
your heart and your college hopes 
dying in front of you, intuition lells 
you they must know something you 
don'LOrdothey? 

Interesting enough, the makers of the 
SAT are now making it harder. Do 
you realize wbal this means? It's hard- 
er to achieve high scores therefore 
making it more difficult for students 
to get accepted into college. 

How many of students were accepted 
into universities on probation because 
of low SAT scores or grades? The 
numbers will be even higher in the 
years lo come. 

Is all this the students' fault? 

Do students need lo begin reading 
encyclopedia's and studying tbe dic- 
tionary for bours each night to get an 
acceptable score on the Achievement 
Test? 

Let's take a moment to review. 

Students are being taught less in pub- 
lic schools. In fact, standards have 
decreased by (wo grade levels since 

1980. These same educators have 
decided that loo much emphasis is 
being placed on "gifted" students and 
not enough on the fact that children 
just aren't as smart as they used to be. 
have made Ibe SAT harder. 

Is anyone out there getting the hint? 

We are being punished because peo- 
ple with 12 degrees haven't figured 
out thai they're NOT helping us with 
these crazed decisions. It's lime some- 
one out there opened their eyes and 
stepped beck into reality. 

With a clearer perspective of school 
priorities, administrators, and teams of 
teachers can more readily define what 
kind of training and assistance they 
need to accomplish their mission. 

With greater involvement and clarity 

about tbe goals and methods of 

change, it also becomes easier lo make 

the case to our community that new 

resources are needed to make system- 
atic change. 

Such systematic changes should be 

the starting point in schools across 

America. 

It's time lo make a change.

Letters to the editor 

Snyder's honesty questioned 



To the Editor 

I would like to respond lo Mark 
Snyder's letter (o tbe Editor (1 1/18/93). 
in hopes of clearing some misinforma- 
tion that be is spreading. While I do not 
wish to banter with Mark Snyder - 1 do 
hope to correct the many errors in his 
letter. 
Mark Snyder states that "four or five 
disgruntled students" ore upset by the 
recent decisions by Dean Gerald Ratliff. 
I found ibat con(cmpluous, since the 
first 'students only' meeting drew about 
fifteen to twenty students (including our 
Etudent elected representative) that were 
concerned wilh Professor Neil Labute's 
contract not being renewed and the 
rapid changes in the department. Of 
course missing from this meeting was 
Mark Snyder. An ironic situation 
indeed since Mark Snyder is always 
making such wonderfully loud, drawn 
out speeches, where be meanders on 
about why students should be more 
involved in their education. Yet be does 
not attend a meeting like this but some- 
how knows exactly bow many students 
are upset Typically, he also fails to 
mention Ihe rapid growth of our stu- 
dent/faculty monthly meetings in the 
(healer department which more than 
"four or five disgruntled students" 
attend and brought up questions about 
Ibe changes in tbe department and 
Professor Labute's termination. I 
believe even at one such meeting thai 
be attended, be stated that il was a 
shame for something like this (referring 
lo the changes in the department) to 
occur, to get students active in monthly 
meetings. 

I was quite dismayed at Mark 
Snyder's attack on (his paper and my 
letter for "suspiciously not revealing 
that there is one single declared play- 
wright in (be department." For me, 
Mark Snyder invalidates bis entire letter 
by stating this lie. I can only conclude 
that Mark Snyder's attempt to distort 
Ibe truth, and press bis own personal 
agenda, is filled throughout bis letter. 
During the meeting, Dean Ratliff said 
that there was only one declared play- 
wright. I believe that Mark Snyder is 
incapable of distinguishing between a 
fact and a speculation. I think "anyone 
with even the most rudimentary or ele- 
mentary critical thinking skills" would 
be able to actually check out the facts 
for themselves before running off a let- 
ter to the press. Of course (ha! is assum- 
ing Mark Snyder is looking (o present 
Ihe truth. Since Mark Snyder failed to 
do that, let me explain what the truth 
really is. A fellow student and play- 
wright, Diana Gard. asked Dean Ratliff 
after Ihe meeting to explain bow he 
knew lhal there was only one play- 
wright declared. He promptly told her 
(hat students were distinguished with a 
code on their records so faculty could 
tell which students where in which 
emphasis. Wilh thai information, she 
relumed to the theater department and 
asked Ibe deportment secretary about 
ihe code, and lo check her status. The 
secretary, who has been here almos( six 
years, bad never heard of (hat. but set 



out lo find tbe code that Dean Ralliff 
referred to. After exhausting her 
resources, (he secretary passed Ibe 
question along to Diana's advisor who 
had also never heard about it. Finally 
department chair, Sieve Sarratore was 
asked about Ibe code ■ which he bad 
never heard of either. Returning to 
Dean Ratliff's office, she voiced her 
concern over tbe information be told 
her, and asked again about ber code. He 
capriciously told ber that he was now 
aware of ihe problem and would look 
into iL By telling students in the meet- 
ing that there was only one play writing 
student, be shrinks the problem down 
considerably along with tbe support. I 
hope Mark Snyder understands that 
sometimes the truth lies farther than bis 
thesaurus. 
Mark Snyder stales that Professor 
Labute "continually chooses lo direct 
his own plays which, based on box 
office success, are not popular..." That 
statement seems to lead (be reader to 
believe that Professor Labute has actu- 
ally done one of bis plays as a part of 
the Purdue -Indian a Theatre season. Up 
until this year (In the Company of Men 
opened on November 12), Professor 
Labute has never done any of bis work 
as part of our season The only work 
thai bas been dooe has been part of our 
studio work which costs the department 
nothing. The work is usually done in 
empty classrooms at night and not 
while our main show is running. These 
studio works use little or minimal slock 
props, and allow students lo help design 
sets and lights for Ihe classrooms being 
used. The department also has no royal- 
ties lo pay, since Professor Labute is the 
author and of course the nominal fee 
that is charged for tickets goes right 
back into (be department It also gives 
students more than just four produc- 
tions lo work on, and il allows (hem to 
experiment on these smaller produc- 
(ions which would not be possible on 
the four major productions of tbe sea- 
son. Anyone with tbe slightest bint of 
elemcn(ory logic would see that no mat- 
ter what the box office response is, the 
department always comes out (he win- 

By following Mark Snyder's logic in 
examining n tbca(er by its box office 
receipts, it is clear tba( in Fort Wayne, 
Civic Theatre must always have the 
best productions since they always sell 
more tickets than anyone else. Its that 
kind of narrow minded logic hurts this 
university and its theatre. I sincerely 
hope that Mark Snyder doesn't believe 
thai a produc( (ha( sells the most is the 
best product available. 

I hope this clears up some of the con- 
fusion that students might have had 
while reading Mark letter. I am amazed 
lhal anyone would even consider writ- 
ing a letter without checking ibeir facts 
to be sure they were true. After reading 
his misleading letter, I have lo wonder 
if all of bis letters are filled with as 
much misinform ation as this one.

Prof upset with article 



To d» Editor 

Felicfa Bcecfaing's article and (be staff 
editorial on Paul Sniderman are painful 
reminders of ibe horrors which racism 
has visited upon us. We Americans are 
fobbed raw by it. When a topic touches 
racism, wbal might in some contexts be 
a simple disagreement or misunder- 
standing becomes jut! another abrasive 
on those wounds. Discussion becomes 
submerged in pain. Our griefs crowd in 
where our intellects might more fruit- 
fully be ernployed- 

I must interject a disclaimer hero. 1 do 
not believe in race. Bruce Hate. 
Chairperson, African - American stud- 
ies, at Syracuse University has 
expressed my view succinctly: 

Racism is tbe belief in tbe existence of 
races and the subsequent pathological 
patterns of human interaction thai occur 
as a consequence of that belief. Thy

ion characteristics are continuous 
among humans. Tbey are not dlcboto-

Caucasoid." These characteristics; are 
probably evolutionary variations as 
humans migrated aboat (he planet. 
Browrmess gave protecuorj and camou- 
flage al the equator and whiteness gave 
protection and camouflage near the

tbe polar bear is white, and there ain't 
nobody talking about races of bess. 
!t is in Hare's sense that I use ibe term, 
racism, and avoid validating tbe concept 
of race. 

Now, to be specific about ihe 
Communicator responses to Sniderrnan- 
1 ibink Sniderman had some very inter- 
esting and some very good daws. 
Unfortunaialy, because of tbe exigen- 
cies of racism, that news never got to 
the Communicator and neo.ee to its 
audience. Let me explain. 

First, we need a list of things 
Sniderman did not say 

i. Universities are freeof racism. 

2. •Tolerance'' is adesirable ideal 

3. For the last 30 years, elementary 
and high school* have provided a good 

muiticuftural education. 

4. Colleges do an acceptable, good or 
nuts landing job of providing a 

multicultural education. 

5. "Tbe issue of racism bas been 
resolved," 

All or these points are ixrelevancies 
brought up by members of tbe audience 
or writers in the Comnwnieator. 1 am 
not saying (bey ore irrelevant to me or 
to the speakers or tbe writers or indeed 
to all Americans. 1 am saying tbey are 
irrelevant to Smderman's presentation. 

So, what Is ibe good news? What did 
Sniderman really say'' 

Sophisticated research indi- 
cate* that a majority of Burupean- 
Americant will sup- 

port social and legislation which they 
perceive to be fair for all 
Americans, regardless of eihnkity. 

Yes. that's ill Tbbl's -Tbe New 
Politics of Race." Tbe dominant force 
in American electoral politics, 
European ■ American voices, favors 
wbat &gt;t perceives to be ethnically neu- 
tral social legislation. 

Over tbe last 13 yean, it has become 
increasingly clear that European- 



Americans will not support social legis- 
lation which is ethnically specific. For 
example, tbey are extremely hostile to 
ideas of affirmative actios, "quotas" 
and "welfare" (wbicb tbey perceive to 
be largely a giveaway to minorities) 
because tbey feel such programs to be 
unfair and "racist" or "reverse racist." 
Tbe reason Sniderman and I think his 
findaig is so unportant is that it points 
to the possibility of passing the legisla- 
tion such as a notional healthcare pro- 
gram which would benefit African - 
Americans enormously without being 
ethnically specific So, in tbe real world 
of getting legislation written and 
passed, Sniderman 't research indicate; 
that people of good will from all ethnic 
backgrounds con ameliorate the results 
of racism witb legislation perceived to 
. be fair be a majority of Americans, 
That is temfic news indeed! 

Thfe ts precisely the point Snidrnoan 
attempted to make when he brought up 
his wife's work as an MD specializing 
in Neonatal Medicine. He pointed oui 
that 7 of every 10 premature infants 
with whom she deals are African - 
American. A national healthcare pro- 
gram would provide prenatal care to 
those mothers and hence prevent most 
of these premature births. Thus, tbe 
national healthcare program, favored by 
a majority of Americans, would inordi- 
nately benefit ounorittes whereat that 
same majority which supports notional 
healthcare would Rot support legislation 
designed to help minorities only. 

Finally, let me briefly address points 2 
and 5 above. As to toe question of. toler- 
ance, what Smderman said was that 30 
years of research consistently showed 
that tbe more education people have, 
the more tolerant they are of other eth- 
nic groups. (Notice there Is no aiftima- 
lion of the concept of "tolerance" and 
not a word about how colleges handle 
murucultural issues.) Numerous exam- 
pies of that research are readily avail- 
able in Helmke library. I have long 
found it convincing, but people are free 
io examine it for (bemselves and they 
should do so. ..... . 

"When Sniderman said race is not* big 
Issue to ihe real world, what be meant 
was that ihe vast majority Of American* 
staph/ do not spend a lot of time think- 
ing, lot alone worrying, about race (or 
racism, for that matter.) We in the uni- 
versity community have the tuna and 
energy to dwell on the topic, but most 
AmOTan*arefarmorecoi« trad with 
tbe site of then' paychecks and wbat b 
on TV. His was a descriptive statement, 
not a claim that this indifference sprang 
from any resolution of die problem. 

But enough of "he saids." Sniderman 
has a book coming out soon- Instead of 
fighting among ourselves, let us join 
together because, as lames Baldwin 
observed: 

if we— and now I mean ihe relatively 
conscious whites and ihe relatively 
conscious blacks, who must, Itkelovert, 
Insist on, or create, the consciousness of 

tbe others— do not Taller in our duty 
now. we may be abie, handful that we 
ore. to end tbe racial nightmare, 

and achieve our country, and change tbe 
history of the world.

Commentary 
Harrassment addressed 



Several weelu ago. Krutie Schlundi, for- 
met editor in chief of The Co mm uni car or, 
commented on die seiua) huuimeat cue 
that maoagct Tcreia Hutu filed against her 
Naihvillc, TN truck letting employer 
(Hutu v. Poiklifl Synenu, Inc.). She qmi 
her job became of the consuni barrage of 
jciual thieiu and Innuendoes her employer, 
Chailei Hardy, continued for a period of two 
yean. (See The Communicator. 10/28A3). 
Schluadf's opinion (with which this wriler 
i.r'i.i , duagreu). wu lliat Hanii wu out of 
line in filing hanumciit charge]. 

According lo the Piruburgh Pon-Gairrte 
(1 1/10/93), Hardy reportedly uked Harru in 
front of other employees if she obtained a 
particular account by having lei with the 
client. According lo Hnirii, juch verbal 
hariument continued on * daily baiu. 



Two weelu ago, the U.S. Supreme Court 
heaid Hani)' cue u to whether ihe could 
file for damage!, since she did no) end up in 
a menial illneis clinic. Previously, tower 

"severe psychological injury" before a 
could file foe sexual harassment in 



that 

In a 9-0 deeisioD (remember Cluence 
Thomas?) in favor of Harris, lusuce Sandra 
Day O'Connor said thai the protection pro- 
vided through the federal law "comes into 
play before the harassing conduct leads lo a 
nervous breakdown." 

1 applaud the Court's decision. The Court 
agreed that Harris, as a hypothetical "rea- 
sonable woman" (as quoted by the Court), 
need not pul up with vulgar and lewd behav- 
ior in the workplace. In other words, if a 
"reasonable woman," considers Ihe behavior 
intolerable, then it'a haraumeni. 



Student upset with charge 



Dear Editor, 

Well golly, if Dean Ratliff it okay in 
Mark Snyder's book, he'a okay by me! 
I'm not sure whose ass Snyder ii kissing 
but be's certainly not making any friends 
among his fellow students. There are 
mote than "four or five" theater students 
upset about Dean Ratlin's dismissal of 
Neil Labute. But as Mr. Snyder pointed 
out in our last student/faculty department 
meeting, apparently we students are too 
ignorant to moke decisions concerning (he 
quality of our professors. 

Perhaps we students should hand our 
liny little minds over to the wisdom of our 
betters, like Mark Snyder has. Neil Labute 
must be a bad man and have questionable 
artistic ideas because he is being fired. 

I challenge you Mr. Snyder to show me 
this vast majority of students that support 
Dean Ratliff. I'm just as involved as any- 
one else, I work with the same studeols 
you do. Where is this mindless mob of 
students that adore the Dean? You know 



what I think? I think you are out lo re- 
establish Ihe Snyder dynasty after your 
fall from grace in Ihe Student 

1 can't speak for Ihe "vast majority" of 
students like our self-appointed 
spokesman Mark Snyder can, but I have a 
few problems with the Dean. I'm not only 
annoyed with Rotliff's heavy-handed 
administration concerning the direction of 
the Theater Department, but I am also 
upset that tho students knew of Neil's dis- 
missal before Neil did. 

As Snyder pointed out, there ore going to 
be changes. I don't know about (he rest of 
the theater students, but I know that I can 
sleep that much more soundly knowing 
there are visionary leaders like Ratliff and 
his supporter Mark Snyder behind these

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q: What happens if I 
give blood at the Red 
Cross and it tests 
positive for HIV? 

A: The Red Cross notifies, 
by registered letter, donors 
whose blood tests positive 
for HIV or other STDs. It is a 
felony in Indiana to 
knowingly donate blood 
containing HIV, so if you 
suspect you have HIV 
infection, you should not 
donate blood. You should 
be tested at the Board of 
Health or by your physician.

Theatre 

Student directs non-traditional play 




Besides acting in theatre, Kira Downey works al the Sweet Shoppe located in Walb Memorial Union. 

PholobyF. L 






On Dec. 2. Kira Downey's senior project 
will become a reality. She will be directing 
and acting in the play "Dutchman." to be 
held Dec. 2-4 in Indiana-Purdue Theater's 
studio the utcr in Kcillet Hall, 
The "Dutchman" is a one-act play by 
lmamu Amiri Baraka iel in a big-cily sub- 
Downey graduates this December with a 
major in iheatcrand a minor in Radio/TV. 
She will play the lead role of Lula, a 
white woman who purposely seeks out a 
young black male by the name of Clay 
(played by Colby Prough), to destroy him 
because of her judgmental stereotyping. 
After a 30 minute confrontation in the sub- 
way, Lula lolls Clay, 
Downey chose this very powerful drama 
as a way to show how ignorance and a per- 
son' s preconceived ideas can depict the 
violent side of racism. 

"This woman is nothing. She 
doesn't want to be overshadowed by this 
block man. She doesn't appreciate seeing a 
black intellectual, so she destroys him," 
said Downey. 
For her senior project, Downey wanted to 
act in a leading role. Believing in non-tra- 
ditional casting, she was looking for a 
challenge. 
As her faculty advisor, Neil Labute, 
assistant professor of theater, come up 
with the idea. She liked it, and went with 
it. 

"Another reason for choosing this play is. 
if the audience sees the roles flipped-

flopped, Ihey might be more introspective 
when they see it [performed] this way," 
said Downey. 

"It is intete sting to me to be on the other 
side of bigotry, because I have been on the 
side where Clay was," added Downey. 

Downey's past experience in theater at 
LPFW includes directing under Labute, as 
well as attending Earlham College in 
Richmond, Ind,, before coming here. 
Most recently she performed in the play 

'Hair." and various other plays al the Fust 
Presbyterian Theater. 

She knew by the age of seven years that 
she wanted lo gel into (his line of work. 
She always liked being al the center of 

"If I didn't get my way, I would Ikrow a 
tanuum." said Downey. 



On the other hand, she describes herself 
as shy and inlroverted, although she says 
the people who know her best may not 
believe that. 

Goals for her future include looking al 
graduate schools lo pursue an M.F.A. in 
acting, and possibly directing. She has not 
made a decision on a school yet, but hopes 
lo be enrolled by the Fall of 1994. 

Another one of her goals is lo become 
more involved in the Non-Traditional 
Casting Project in New York, in some line 
of work. She learned of them recently, 
and this caused her to produce "The 
Dulchman" as her senior thesis. 

Downey wants her audience nol lo be 
bothered by the role reversal, but to lisien 
to what is going on in this n on -traditional 
play, and to keep an open mini

Writers read original work 



On Thursday, Nov. 
Department of English and Linguistics 
sponsored (he seventh annual Fall 
Reading. 

This year's Foil Reading lurried out quile 
successful, according lo Wendell Mayo, 
Assistant Professor or English al IPFW. 

"The Writer* at Work series is an out- 
standing opportunity for working poet). 
Action writers, and essayists wbo are 
IPFW students lo share their work with tbe 
campus community," explained Mayo. It 
brings students with common interests 
together and allows raculty to learn about 
studenis' ini^rests and concerns. 



Readers included Maiita Avila, 
Michael Beauchol. Roy R Cechvalo. 
Curut Criiler. Shelly Cross. M. Lucianne 
IPFW Hanafeld. Cheryl Meier, and Jim Walker. 
According to Mayo, these readers serve 
nol only as writers, but also as role mod- 



els. 

"Many of the students reading have been 
published in literary magazines, have pub- 
lished books and have been invited inlo 
IPFW writing classes rot further discus- 
sion of their work," said Mayo, 

Meier read a prose poem from her book 
emitted "Plasma". Criiler, also a pub- 
lished poet, read from his book, "One 
Black Man's Mind: Part 2." Avila and 
II jn.uvU olio conduct visiting writer's 
classes at IPFW where Ihey talk about

The group also combined some 
comedic elements to their act as well as

Darn Hoodlums, sold over 600 copies 
copies. It consisted of several original 
pieces composed by the group 
hers. 

"From our start long ago in Canada, to 
our present ever growing success, 
we've enjoyed the power of harmony 
and the thrill of energizing audiences. I 
also really enjoy the fact that we are 



come in five captivating colors," sai 
grc-up member Scott Henderson. 

EarthTONES is looking to produce 
video and another album as well a

Louise advises lonely woman 




Dear Aunt Louise, 



I ha\ 



problem. I know you're 
probably used to all of these people 
coming to you with their problems. 
Ob, well, here I am with my problem. 

Why is it that every single type of 
man I meet always turns out to be a 
real jerk? At first tbey pretend like 
they are gentlemen, then the true dog 
comes out and plays. I think lo 
myself, "Damn, another one bites the 
dust." 

What usually happens on the first 
date with these kind of men is the fact 
that [ spend hours getting all prettied 
up, and the guy is too damn 



lo even notice 

Then. I'm expecting to be wined and 
dined at a fancy restaurant, and what 
do I get? • 

I get to spend my evening deciding 
whether or not to have fries with my 
Big Mac. 

I know down deep in this heart of 
mine thai all guys aren't really like 
that, but I'm really having trouble find- 
ing the good ones. Is there any hope 

The only thing that I know is that I 
am not getting any younger, and I feel 
I'm ready for a relationship with a real 

Please help me. Aunt Louise, you're 
my only hope. 

Sincerely, 
Fed Up with Big Macs 

Dear Fed Up wiih Big Macs. 

Sugar dumpbng, where are you find- 
ing these men, in the ban? 

I remember when I was growing up. 
my cousin, Eugenia, would always go 
to the bars and pick up these men. 

Unfortunately, Genie, isn't with us 
today. One too many men, I guess. 



Anyway, what you need to do as I 
always advise, is find yourself ■ good 
man ... and the place lo do that is in 
the church. You will not find any 
dogs, we used to call ihem. reprobates, 
or men wiih children or those "girlie" 
men (you know what I mean, the ones 
thai swing in the opposite— oh I'm loo 
embarrassed lo finish the sentence). 

But that's where you need lo go, to 
the church. That's where I met my 
sweel, cornbread-eatin'-lovin' ol' 
porkchop, Don. us 




Your loving Aunt Loui
