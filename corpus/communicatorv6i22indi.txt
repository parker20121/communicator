All-university senate 



\ document proposm,: .1 



•sity senate is hi-iuji reported to the Ad Hoc 
Joint FacUlty Steering Committee (AHJFSC) by its Task Force on University 
Governance The document represents Ihetin.il product of nearly one year's work 
bv the lask force. 

The proposal creates .1 university assembly U&gt; deal wilh mailers relevant lo 
faculty, slaff and students ll also sets op a separate faculty senate In deal with 
faculty and academic mailers Further, it recommends Ilia! sludenls and slaff 
groups establish their own individual representative bodies to handle matters of 
primary interest to them. 

Critical to the document is Ihe compromise Dial saw its adoption by the lask 
force. An all-university senate in addition lo individual senates is not what any 
member of the lask force thought would be the end result of all those meetings 
Some members wanted separate senates m i each consliluencv (Hhers wanted just 
one Lxidv for everyone Hut what every member ol the lask force did want was ft 
document that would he workable and acceptable lo Hie faculty and others. 
j Task force members could easily see the need for increased communication 
between campus constituencies and for more input from non-faculty sources in 
certain common areas ol interest, such as parking and calendar On the other 
hand, the faculty wanted to maintain I he academic prerogatives granted it over the 
years Also, the absence of a campus academic structure made it necessary for a 
single faculty senate lo represent all faculty. 
' Proposing both bodies was the logical compromise i« be reached. 

The document now goes to AHJFSC and then on lo the faculty Once approved 
by tin' faculty, the proposal niM-ds apprn\ a Miom the ol her campus constituencies 
and then the chancellor 

The lask force was a broadly based committee id faculty, sludenls, and 
proles-anna] and service clerical stalf The interest ol all these groups have been 
taken into account in (he preparation of the proposal Where these interests 
conflict, the document represents a fair compromise, It would he a shame if this 
spiril of compromise is lost now. 



Women's athletics 



njustice is real' or imagined, it is refreshing to discover a real injustice that has 
existed far loo long that is heing changed. 

The problem exists mi Hie campus ol ll'FW Simply staled, il has to do with the 
imbalance that exists holwcen male and lemale athletic programs on the Fort 
Wayne campus. 

'We all conveniently forget that any lemale who carries nine credit hours or 
more pays the same activity lee as her male counterpart , yet athletic programs to 
benefit her are practically iion-exlstflnt. 

Aminor furor was experienced in January of lias year, when women had the 
audacity to go beloro the Joint Athletic Advisory Committee with a request for a 
appropriation ol one thousand dollars, wilh which lostarla 



OPINION 



Energy crisis - no help from public 



s Softball ti 
during the Spring semester The request was approved, but nol without a hassle 
over whether the request was "parliamentarily correct," 

There are mum different things overlooked by vis all in the noble struggle of 
women lo achieve real equality with their male counterparts, athletics is one of the 
more glaring omissions. 

Fortunately, something is being done to correct I he present imbalance. James 
Syers, the new chairman ol the Joint Alblelic Advisory Committee, has formed 
sub-committee to look into the possibilities ol expansion ol athletic programs lor 
the women of tins campus Hopefully, the most easily adopted programs can he 
initialed in time for the Iti7f.-7(i academic year. 

There is an athletic budget Ibid we all must live wilh, and Hie male alblelic 
programs already established aie hound lo suffer some nil hacks lo make room 
for any new women's programs The S&gt; alblelic lee paid liy female students on this 
campus is Hie same r ,oo cents paid by males, and we are all entitled to a fair return. 

The sub-committee ot JAAC is looking for suggestions from any interested 
persons on which piogi amsto initiate lor women It you have a preierence, contact 
them in the Student C111011, room 22a The coiiiniillee will appreciate your input.

bcr of places displayed. (The HP-21 always 
uses all 10 digits internally.) 

If a number is too large or small for fixed 
decimal display, the HP-21 switches automati- 
cally to scientific. It never confuses a smaller 
niunlK'i with zero. 

Finally, if you give the HP-21 an impossible 
instruction, the Display spells E-r-r-o-r. 
RPN logic system. Here's what this unique 
logic system means for you; 

• You can evaluate any expression without 
copying parentheses, worrying about hierar- 
chies or re-structuring beforehand. 

• You can solve nil problems your way — the 
way you now use when you use a slide rule. 

• You solve all problems — no matter how com- 
plex — one step at a time. You never wort: 



• You can re-use numbers without re-entering 
them. The HP-3 1 becomes your scratch pad. 
HP quality craftsmanship. One reason Nobel 
Prize winners, astronauts, conquerors of Ever- 
est, America's Cup navigators and over 51)0,000 
other professionals own H-P calculators. 
Your bookstore will give you a demonstra- 
tion today. Challenge our new HP-21 with 
your problems. See foi yourself how much per- 
formance $135.00* can buy. If your bookstore 
doesn't have the HP-21 yet, call us at 800- 
538-7922 (in Calif. 800-662-9862) for the 
name of a dealer who does.

• You see all intermediate answers immediately. 
The HP-21 executes each function immedi- 
ately after you press the function key. 

• You can easily backtrack when you e
