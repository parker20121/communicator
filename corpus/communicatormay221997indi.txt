Child care center starts semester with changes 

New director wants to provide 



safe, fun learning environment 



by Scott Warden 
Editor- In-Chief 

The half-dozen kids held hands and 
skipped along the cold and wet grass Monday 
morning as they, jusl like everyone taking sum- 
mer classes, began their summer session at 
IPFW. 

It was Monday that the IPFW Child Care 
Center opened it.-, doors to children of students 
and faculty of IPFW and IVY Tech. 

The center is entering I 
its fourth year with a new 
director. Lynda Place took 
over the position of watch- 
ing other people's children 
at the beginning of the 
week. 

"It's my responsibilit; 
to set up the program and 
the curriculum as well as 
make sure thai the staff and)/ 
I are following the rules and 
regulations." said Place 
"Also, I decide what direc- 
tion we'll lake as a child 
care center." ^— ^— -^— ^~ 

A child care center can have a wide range 
of responsibilities, said Place 

"It can be anywhere from what would peo- 
ple would think of as 'just baby-sitting,' to a 
place where children can come and leam and 
where there's a lot going on," 

Play dough was the main focus of the group 
late Monday morning as one group sat around

Place 



the miniature table and chairs as they rolled and 
molded all colors into various shapes. 

"I made a snake," uttered one of the chil- 
dren "It's a green, poisonous snake," he added. 

"My goal right now," said Place, "is to have 
a center where the children love to come, the 
parents feel like they're gelling very good care 
in a safe environment and there are a lot of 
interesting things that will capture their atten- 
tions," 

Another one of the center's goals, said 
Place, is to look towards working with the edu- 
cation department. 

"I'm not sure what direction that we'll take 
at this poinl. but it would be nice to have more 
students involved here " 

Making the center an all-around learning 
and fun atmosphere is the top priority. 

"I have found over the years that the best 
advertisement for a child care center is by word 
of mouth. That is the way we're going lo grow. 
If the parents are confident in the center, then 
the enrollment will continue to grow." 

The center can only be used on a part-time 
basis. The maximum that a parent can take 
advantage of the facilities is 20 hours per week. 

The cosl of care for IPFW students is $2.20 
per hour for the first child and SI. 60 for each 
additional child. 

Summer hours arc 7:45 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, and 7:45 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesdays. The center is closed 
on Fridays. 

To register for the summer or fall sessions, 
call the center at 482-3719.

Computer kiosks! 

Students log on to new access stations 



by Scott Warden 
Editor-in-Chief 

The over-flowing 
computer labs are 
always packed 
with people who are actu- 
ally doing work. Like writ- 
ing papers and doing 
reports is more important 
than checking e-mail. 

We've all been in that 
situation where actual stu- 
dents are occupying all of 
the computers, leaving no 
vacancies for a speedy e- 
mail check. 

But now. Computer 
and Data Processing 
Services has installed e- 
mail quick stations. 

The stations are locat- 
ed throughout the campus 
and are currendy in the 
lounge area of Helmke 
Library, Classroom- 
Medical Building and 
KetUer Hall. The four in 
Helmke will be accessible 
24 hours a day. 

"The ones in the 
library are open now as 
well as in Classroom- 
Medical Building and 
Keitler. but ihe few in Neff 
and Walb should be open 
within the next couple of 
days," said Mary Schoeler.

Tor Computer and Data 
Processing Service. 

With the stations, stu- 
dents will be able to check 
their mail as well as hook 
up to the text banks of the 
library. 

"For full service inter- 
net and e-mail, students 
will still have to go lo the 
computer labs," said 
Schoeler "The only differ- 
ences with the individual 
stations and the labs is that 
you won't be able to print 
out your messages and that 
they system runs in a DOS 
format " 

According to Schoeler, 
the main concern with the 
quick stations is after stu- 
dents are finished check- 
ing e-mail, tbey must make 
sure to log off of the sys- 
tem, ensuring them that the 
next user won't be able to 
tamper with their account. 

Though the terminals 
are relatively new, they've 
been being used frequent- 

iy. 

"We put the ones in 
Ketder in, but haven't bad 
ume to put signs up yet," 
said Schoeler "By the end 
of the first day. though, 
several people had figured 
out what they were and 
had logged on."

The first of the ATM-like machines will be installed at the Speedway 
license branch, following a two week test-run at the BMV's service center 
in Indiana Government Center South 

All 35 machines should be running within a year. Thirty will be placed 
at license branches statewide, mostly in urban areas. The others could be 
installed at busy malls, such as Circle Center and Castleton Square in 
Indianapolis 

Estimates of how much the machines could save Ihe bureau vary wide-

Teacher's methods 
questioned; Klan rallies 



How do you (each about the 
K .. Kin. Klan'Mmukl 
oihcr"haie groups" like ihe 
skinheads or the Aryan Nation be 
laugh! in elementary schools? 

Last week, a fourth-grade 
teacher in nearby Syracuse received 
an answer 10 one of these questions. 
In lie independent siudy portion of 
her class she had a word search puz- 
zle with racial epithets This was, 
according 10 the teacher, "an exer- 
cise (o make students aware of its 
[the KKK's] existence in Indiana 
and the devastating effect ... it can 
have on socieiy." 

Apparently, the teacher has been 
using the same exercise for about 10 
years. In addition to the word search 
were questions about the colors 
worn by Klan leaders and reasons 
why people join the group. 

One student's parents brought 
the word search to the school's 
attention and the exercises were 
removed from the curriculum. 

Although wc agree that learning 
about the Klan's role in Indiana his- 
tory is important, wc disagree with 
the teacher's methods on the word 
search The teacher made a game 
out of rinding words like "nigger." 
"kykc," "spic" and "slope," 



We'bclicve the teacher's heart 
was in the nghi place and her own 
feelings about race arc not in ques- 
tion. What we do question is her 
judgment, especially with recent 
examples of racial tension like the 
Rodney King beating, the subse- 
quent riois and the O.J. Simpson 
trial. 

In a bizanc side note to this 
already strange story, the KKK ral- 
lied on Friday, May 16, to support 
the teacher. Everyone knows how 
despicable the Klan is, so we won't 
bore you by telling you how bad the 
KKK is. 

But one has to admire the group 
for cashing in on this opportunity 
for some free publicity. They want 
to get on the news and get exposure 
for what they are. 

Wc believe that is exactly what 
Ihe teacher was trying lo do — 
expose the Klan. Only by facing evil 
or hale wdl groups like this perish 
from the face of the earth. 

Until that time, we must not 
blind ourselves to the truth thai 
groups, like the Klan, exist and are 
part of our society. Aside which we 
don't want to see, but it is there If 
wc pretend it docs not exist, then we 
are only helping their cause.

then we no longer are free.

"All countries have news . . .

To the Editor: 

I would like to address ihe con- 
flict between United S equalities and 
the straight cominunily of this cam- 
pus. Before I start 1 would like lo say 
I have spoken to at least 50 people 
that agree with my views. United 
Sexualities feels thai their posters 
are being tampered with. 

I will not disagree with this 
assessment The straight community 
feels (hat United Sexuahiies posters 
are open invitations for unwanted 
attention I will not disagree with 
this. The conflict between these two 
groups is wrong. Both groups need 
lo SHUT UP and gel on with their 
lives. 

Every person in this couniy has 
the right to their sexual preferences. 
They should not be judged by iheir 
preference, but the reality is that 
they will. This will not change If 
United Sexualities wants to change 
these views, they are going about it 
ihe wrong way. 

I have seen posters thai say "we 
are here — deal with it." It seems 
ihey are trying to force themselves 



plaining about! When you poke 
someone in the chest, you do not 
complain when (hey punch you. If 
the people of Unilcd Sexualities are 
secure in who they are. ihey should 
not purposely draw atlention lo 
themselves. 

The straight community should 
not deface the Uniicd Sexualities 
posters. If they are secure about 
themselves, ihey would leave 
United Sexualities alone The homo- 
sexual community of this school and 
the world have a right to exist open- 
ly without harassment of any kind. 

In reality, I feel this will never 
happen. However, I choose not to 
add to the problem, ihere enough 
"REAL" problems in this world that 
deserve at tendon. 

I am an unequivocally straight 
male. What are my views on homo- 
sexuality? They do not matter. The 
issues on this subject are irrelevant 
lo my point. To put it simply, we do 
not care about the issues. In conclu- 
sion I would like to restate my (he- 
sis, "Both of you SHUT UP."

Public arena no place for Ellen to 
come out with her sexual preference 



Dear Editor; 

I would like to address the topic 
of Ellen Degeneres "coming oul of 
die closet" while there is sull Lime 1 
mean, before this story is lotally 
blown out of proportion by the 
tabloids and die general public or 
suddenly this story is labeled as a 
total hoax. 

To me this siory sounds like an 
American way of life anymore. 
Everyday people are deciding lo 
"come out of the closet" to tell their 
friends and family of their sexual 
preference. So, I jusi cannot quite 
grasp why it is any different for 
Ellen Degeneres to tell aboul her 
sexual preference. The only differ- 
ence between Ellen lelling the pub- 
lic about her sexual preference to a 
girl lelling her mother, father, 
friends and family of her sexual 
preference is that Ellen is a big-time 
TV sitcom star and the girl is not 
Why does there have to be a big 
emphasis on who Ellen chooses to 
be with? 

To me. Ellen Degeneres going 
public saying thai she is a lesbian is 
nol really anything to call the news 
crews over. 1 mean, honestly, when 
the famous music singer. Melissa 
Ethridge. "came oul of ihe closet." 
she did not attract all of the atlention 
that Ellen Degeneres has attracted 



with her announcement that she is a 
lesbian, the only difference between 
the I wo of Ihem is that you listen lo 
Melissa' and&lt; you watch Ellen. No 
mailer what a persons' career is. no 
matter what sexuality a person wish- 
es to pursue, they are still human 
beings. Thai cannot be changed 
Therefore, I do not feel they should 
be flocked to or harassed by the 
media, because or the simple fact 
that they choose lo be lesbians. 

I feel that Ellen announcing she 
is a lesbian is nothing that needs to 
be advertised. You never see the 
news stations covering a story about 
a person saying they are heierosexu- 
al. They do not advertise or put 
emphasis on (hat sexual preference, 
so what is the difference? A person's 
sexual preference is their choice, 
what they choose to do with thai 
choice is their business and it should 
stay that way A person is nol a piece 
of meat They cannot be ireatcd as 
one just because they choose to be 
different from Ihe rest. 

If everyone treated everyone 
else as an outcast just because tbey 
were different, this world would be- 
at a constant war

Speaking for the trees for they have no tongues 



To ihe Editor: 

The machine's giant claw lifts 
the log as if it were weightless. The 
log is then shoved in to another 
playfully named "Chipper" 

Chipper has chewed its way 
through three miles of riverbank in 
25 days. All (he trees and brush 
along the Sl loseph River from 
Concordia High School to (be 
Columbia Street bridge is now 
gone All that remains for com- 
mulcrs to look ai is a muddy river 
and dozens of tree slumps. 

This massive dcsiruetion of 
irecs is pan of a S45 mdlion flood- 
relief project that ihe city of Fort 
Wayne has just begun. Once the 
project is complete by the year 
2001, the riverbanks will also be 
covered with large rocks called 
"riprap." 

An asphalt bike path with street 
lights every 100 yards is in the 
works As a result of the project, the 
riverbanks will be three to four feet 
higher than they currency are. This 
will take some 4,000 homes out of 
the flood plain. 

These residents will no longer 
have to invest their money in Hood 



insurance. They will also be able to 
build on to their homes, something 
lhal was strictly prohibited while 
your house is in a flood zone. 

There is, however, one major 
flaw in the city's plans-the animals. 
By tearing down hundreds of trees, 
Ibe ciiy is destroying the homes of 
many animals Residents who live 
in the St. Joseph Boulevard 
Neighborhood have seen animals in 
their backyards and running across 
busy streets in search of food. 

One man, who has lived in ihe 
the area since 1968. comment that 
besides providing die animals with 
a place lo live, the trees also provide 
shade on hoi summer days, and 
muffled the sounds of the many 
trains that travel through downtown 
Fori Wayne 

Another woman who has lived 
in die area for 42 years has never 
had her house flooded. 

When asked about the advan- 
tages, she replied, laughing, that she 
migbl be able lo sec the downtown 
fireworks. She also went on to say 
that she can't sec any real advan- 
tages, and said she thinks the whole 
project is terrible. 

Fort Wayne is choosing lo 



ignore this problem that is a direct 
result from iheir actions. They have 
no plans of relocating the animals or 
providing them with food and shel- 

The worst pan of it all is thai 
they aren't done yet. 

Foliage along the St. Mary's 
river, near the west side of the Sl. 
Joseph river to Slate Boulevard is 
also going to be destroyed 

This further destruction will 
displace hundreds of more animals. 
The more animals that are out on 
the sireel, the more likely the 
chance of them gelling killed by the 
30.000 commuters that travel the 
area daily. 

While I commend the city for 
finally laking action for our contin- 
uing flood problem, they could 
have done it belter. 

Animals need to be relocated or 
somewhat cared for. It is a cruel 
thing to lake an animal's home and 
leave them abandoned in (he city. 
The city needs to take responsibility 
for what they've done Action needs 
to be taken, before it's too late

him because he goi stuck being married to the perkiest, 
spunkiest anil most annoying person on television. At 
least when she's on the tube, we can turn the channel. 
Unfortunately, he also choked it by getting allegedly 
caught with his literal pants down by being videotaped 
with a married flight attendant. 

The New York Knicks choked it when 

they cleared the bench during an altercation with the 
Miami Heat. Ironically it was in front of their former 
coach, Pat Riley, who instilled the tbug attitude in 
them. 

Indy Racing League continues smoking it 

during the time trials. Who needs the big name drivers 
anymore. Who needs Championship Auto Racing 
Teams? This vear's 500 has so much excitement in all 
the new drivers and the accessibility to new teams has 
improved the race. 

President Clinton smoked it by apologiz- 
ing for the crimes against humanity to 399 African- 
American men who submitted to a government study 
which knowingly failed to treat members of a control 
group infected with syphillis. Didn't Dr Mengele do 
tests like this in Auschwitz or Dachau? 



O.J. SIMPSON choked ii by losing his ability to 
lie convincingly. He was almost believable when he 
denied murdering his ex-wife. Nicole Brown, and Ron 
Goldman, but he couldn't convince anyone that he lost 
his Heismann Trophy. S100.000 in loans or an Andy 
Warhol painting. 

SlMPSON choked it again by putting his name on 
the "most-eligible bachelor" list. He is looking for 
someone who has "to live on a golf eourse and be able 
to support me and my family." The audacity this mur- 
derer has is disgusting, 

JANET RENO choked it when she recommend- 
ed the death penalty for accused "Unabomber" Ted 
Kaczynski. Reno has gone against her own personal 
beliefs about the death penally and has compromised 
berseireven further. She came into the office as some- 
one who stood up for her beliefs. Now she has become 
a bell-weather attorney general. She must be taking les- 
son from the chief executive. 

IBM's Deep Blue smoked it when it 

stomped chess grand master Gary Kasparov. Kasparov

To the Editor: 

Every year the government and 
individual colleges give millions of 
dollars to college students so the 
youth of America can have a better 
chance to achieve a successful 
future. 

The government gives away 
money in forms of grants and loans. 
I receive both and appreciate the 
help to pay for my college educa- 
tion. The problem with the govern- 
ment giving away these millions of 
dollars is that students will lake the 
money and pay their bills, but never 
go to classes. 

There are many students who 
will take their loans and grants and 
never come to school. That activity 
really pisses off a lot of students 



who are not receiving financial aid 
and have to pay for classes out of 
their own pocket- 
To amend this problem, the gov- 
ernment has begun to demand that 
colleges have some classes take 
attendance and re port the si u dents 
that do not come on a regular basis. 
This has helped curb the millions of 
dollars being thrown away, but there 
are many classes that do not take 
attendance. 

My psychology class does not 
take attendance and it is a very big 
class, so one person is not noticed if 
they are not there. I have taken 
advantage of this because I have to 
been to approximately 10 classes 
this semester. 1 believe every class 
should take attendance and report 
students who have missed more 



than four times and fail those stu- 
dents. 

Most students will complain if a 
policy of that son would go into 
effect T know I would initially com- 
plain and whine because 1 am used 
to missing classes just because I did 
not want to get out of bed 

In the long run. students will 
appreciate the policy because it will 
make them better students by hav- 
ing to go to classes, and be forced to 
listen to lectures and take notes It 
will also help the government and 
colleges save money or be able to 
help the students that really want to 
go to college more.

patible time , The campus seems that 
they need to make more class limes 
so students can graduate on lime 
and not wait to take classes. 

Students have a hard time grad- 
uating from college when ibey had 
planned to. The reason why they do 



not is because they have a hard time 
getting into classes. There are noi 
enough class times for the amount 
of students attending. 

IPFW needs to accommodaic 
the students before they accommo- 
date the staff. Is it possible that ihe 
university is making it hard to get 
into certain classes and not offering 
enough times so they can get anoth- 
er year out of everyone, so you do 
not graduate on time? 

Graduation for a student is a big 
goal, and everyone wants to gradu- 
ate as soon as possible. The sched- 



uling of classes makes it difficult to 

do thai on lime. The university 
needs to accommodate the students 
before the staff. The university 
exists for students to gel a higher 
education and is not here for the 
staff or administration and not to 
make money. The university needs 
to provide accommodations for the 
student, as the student makes up the 
university.

nced for this institution." This seems 
to be a prevalent quote used on cam- 
pus, displayed with stupendous 
immodesty. 

But what puzzles me is the lack 
of concern for our safety as students. 

If we are so important, then why 
do we put ourselves in danger every 
time we embark on our journeys, 
some longer than others, to school? 

I am as much for getting all the 
education you can as Ihe next guy or 
gal, but when is it more important 
than your life and possibly the lives 
of others? This past winter, I drove 
45 minutes to school in the worst 
conditions just to get my education. 

There are so many other stu- 
dents that suffer ihe same "fate" as 
me, some have to drive even longer. 
IPFW should have more cancella- 
tions during the winter months. 

I know that it is SPRING and 
who wants to think about WINTER 



and ihe BITTER cold, but if there is 
another winter like the one we just 
had, then I want to make sure my 
safety is rightfully considered. 
IPFW is a commuter college and 
that does not mean that only Fori 
Wayne residents attend. 

Several students travel much 
farther. This past winter was a night- 
mare, I witnessed numerous acci- 
dents on the way to school, some of 
them were fatal. 

One car coming up off an exit 
couldn't win over icy conditions. 
The car lost control and it looked as 
if the Winter Olympics look a horri- 
fying turn, the car looked like it was 
ice skating. Then it unleashed its 
rage as il went off the road and hit a 
bridge, landing in a snow drift. 

After observing this, I still had 
30 more miles to travel. What nor- 
mally would take a 45 minute jour- 
ney home, turned into a 90 minute 
nightmare. I once heard that as col- 
lege students, you need to leam 
responsibility. And one of those 
responsibilities is getting to school, 1 
agree, but when the roads get as 
slippery as silk there is no time to 



argue. 

Getting home can be extremely 
risky, when things look bleak, we 
should be let out early, Once on the 
way home from school, I swerved to 
miss a car losing control. Needless 
to say. we both ended up in the 
ditch. We were both alright, all 
bones attached, but if we (the stu- 
dents) would have left earlier, this 
whole incident may have been 
avoided. There are many others that 
have to leave home in terrifying 
conditions. And for them, it's not a 
"hop, skip and a jump" either. 

It may be a "Winter 
Wonderland" for some people but 
for those who risk their lives to get 
to school il is a "winter nightmare." 
There need to be more cancellations, 
if the students are not around — there 
would be no need for this institution. 

So what is more important than 
the safety of ihe students?

Group suffers when some fail to contribute 



Knight loses touch with NCAA tournament losses 



To the Editor: 

Lately the men's basketball 
coach at Indiana University, Bob 
Knight, has been under fire for his 
coaching style and behavior on and 
off the court, People are starting to 
question his competence, and 
whether or not he still has the abil- 
ity to coach a champion. His teams 
have made early exits from the 
NCAA tournament the last three 
years. The question is: Should he 
stay, or should he go? 

Bobby Knight is one of the best 
college basketball coaches in histo- 
ry. He has won 11 Big Ten Titles. 
three national championships, and 
won the post-season NIT back in 
1979 when the NIT was a big 
thing.The NIT is ihe National 
Invitational Tournament held in 
New York City, From his first year 
at Indiana he proved he was going 
to be a great coach by taking his 
leam to the Final Four in "73 to be 
beaten by the eventual champions 
UCLA, led by center Bill Walton. 
Right from the start Bob Knight 



made an impact. 

When I think of Indiana, I think 
of one man . , . Bobby Knight. 
Bobby Knight is undoubtedly the 
best basketball coach to ever reside 
at Indiana University. Lately his 
teams have not been, how should 1 
put it, up to par. Questions have 
been raised to whose fault it is? 
Usually, the first person who gets 
the finger pointed at them is the 
head coach. But in this case, it was 
the players who were getting the 
finger pointed at them. I think that 
some of the so-called "All- 
Americans" were not playing to 
their full potential at limes, It is true 
thai sometimes when you get too 
many superstars on one team the 
players do not mesh real well. Take 
the NBA team the Dallas 
Mavericks. They had Jimmy 
Jackson, Jamaal Mashbum, and 
Jason Kidd at one time. 

All three men were All- 
Americans at the collegiate level 
Everyone thought the Mavericks 



were going to be the best team in 
the NBA in a couple years because 
they had the three J's. The idea 
blew up in their faces. So you see, 
not every team that has several 
good players is always good. 
Maybe it is not Coach Knight's 
fault. 

On the other hand, maybe 
Coach Knight is finally starting to 
lose his (ouch. It seemed like 
Knight used to succeed no matter 
what he had talent-wise. These 
days, having talent does not mean 
anything ai Indiana. Getting to the 
.500 mark in Ihe Big Ten is all I 
hope for now. I remember when it 
seemed like Indiana was going to 
win the Big Ten every year, or con- 
tend for the national championship. 
What happened io those years? 

Those wonder years are a thing 
of the past unless Bob Knight gives 
up his head coaching job.

To the Editor 

What is the easiest way of get- 
ting a big project accomplished? 
Split up the parts and do it as a 
group. Through the years, I have 
noticed that more heads are better 
than one at almost everything Noi 
only that, group work is a great way 
of learning how to work as a team, 
and thai is what the real world is all 
about. Working together gels things 
done faster and more complete. 
There are always downfalls, those 
we just can not rely on end that is 
jusi a part of life. Many find ways 
around the fact, make up the differ- 
ence, and that is the way a team gets 
their win I think that if there is lime 
in class for a group project, then the 
professor should encourage it. It is a 
great way to get things done and fun 
to participate in. 

My communications class this 
semester was based half on individ- 
ual work and half was what we did 
in our groups. A "group" defined by 
my communications book is a small 
collection of people who interact 
with each other, usually face-to- 



face, over time in order to reach 
goals. Personally, 1 liked the group 
work because our presentations 
were more complete and each of our 
speeches flowed together to create 
one, big, long presentation. Working 
together gave us a chance to get to 
know one another and realize that 
there are good people out there that 
can help you when you need it. Our 
last speech of the semester was the 
best one. Some of us got together to 
work on a video, and then we all got 
together to put on the final touches. 
It was a lot of fun and encouraging. 
You always had someone to talk 
things over with, just to make sure 
things sounded all right. 

Of course there is always thai 
one person who just screws up 
everything. They end up slowing the 
group down, but those who are there 
are usually willing to cover anything 
that one is not there for, Actually, 
they will cover the part missing 
because the group wants a good 
grade. Most of the time that person 
will think that he or she is going to 



be alright because the group will 
make up for it. My speech group had 
one of those and we let the teacher 
know about it. Why should the rest 
of the group look bad because one 
person did not do their pan 1 Nobody 
wants to look bad. It is not group 
work if people are not willing to 
help out another person in a lime of 
need, i.e., that grade in the end 

I do believe that group work is 
beneficial, if the proper group is 
established, things will get done, 
and they will be done right. Even 
though there are those few who do 
rely too much on the group, they 
have to realize that they are part of 
the group and that others are relying 
on them io do their pan. Remember, 
do not let ihe whole group suffer just 
became one or two members are 
slacking. Tell them, make them real- 
ize how much more can get done in 
a group and that there is a grade 
involved!

I.U. needs new coach; Knight has lost his magic 



Being a Big Ten basketball 
coach is a lough job, but if you can 
noi produce a winning team 1 think 
that it's only fair to find someone 
who can. Bob Knight is clearly past 
his prime and has lost his touch on 
how to coach a successful basket- 
ball team. If Indiana University 
finds a new coach they might actu- 
ally be able to compete again. 

I am a very loyal Purdue fan 
and I'm almost afraid to tell you 
I.U fans the obvious because it 
might give Keady's kids a run for 
their money Purdue has won the 
last five games against the Hoosiers 
and I give Purdue a great deal of 
credit for that but 1 also have to 
give Bob Knight credit too because 
bis coaching has been a tremendous 
help io the Boilers' success of play- 



ing Indiana. 

I have talked to I.U. fans in the 
beginning of the basketball season 
and they are always talking trash 
about how good ihe new players 
are at I.U. and how good they are 
going to be. but at the end of the 
year it is always the same thing 
Another bad season for ihe 
Hoosiers It is also the same thing 
year after year for the Boilers only 
opposite. Everybody says how bad 
Purdue looks and how terrible they 
look but Ihey always seem to have 
a very successful ball team by the 
end of the year. 

I don't care if you have the best 
recruits, the worst recruits, the best 
all-around players, or the worst all- 
around players, it takes a good 
coach to make a good ball team, I 



think that is the difference right 
now between Purdue and I.U.. 
Purdue has an excellent coach and 
I.U. has a coach who is slowly los- 
ing his magic as each year pro- 
gresses. 

I just want to open some of I.U. 
fans' eyes and let them know that 
the reason why I.U. has been strug- 
gling lately is because of two 
words: BOB KNIGHT. I miss that 
Indiana and Purdue used to be 
fighting neck and neck for the Big 
Ten Championship- 1 guarantee that 
if the Hoosiers find a new success- 
ful coach they will see great 
progress in the Indiana Hoosiers 
basketball team.

To the Editor: 

A man murders four people like 
a butcher slaughtering livestock, and 
is brought to trial. During the trial, 
the man is offered a plea bargain and 
is sentenced to life in prison instead 
of the death penalty. While in 
prison, this murderer will receive 
three square meals a day, a roof over 
his head, and many other advan- 
tages. These other advantages 
include everything from cable tele- 
vision io having an opportunity to 
obtain a college degree and work out 
in nice gyms. Not to mention the 
free medical attention they receive. 
This could easily be considered par- 
adise for someone who has nothing 
before they enter the slammer. 
Unfortunately, someone has to pay 
for these advantages. Who pays for 
these advantages? We do! 

Everyday criminals arc sen- 
tenced to life in prison, and every 
day we pay to give these vile crimi- 
nals a belter life than many people 
have who are not in jail. Not every- 
one can afford three meals a day, but 
this is provided for criminals who 
have not earned the right to be a part 
of society. Why is this seemingly 
overlooked. Some people even com- 



mit crimes so they can be pui in jail. 
Being in prison with a roof over 
their head is probably better than 
having no roof at all, and besides 
that an inmate can work out at the 
gym or waich cable television to 
pass the time- 
Fortunately, there are a few 
solutions to this problem The first 
solution would simply be to make 
the prison seem more like a prison. 
This would involve taking all of the 
so-called luxuries prisoners enjoy 
out of the prison, and making the 
prisoner feel more like what they are 
as opposed to a guest. Another solu- 
tion would involve sending convict- 
ed felons to a different type of facil- 
ity. A good example of this would 
be a boot camp, Not only would this 
teach the prisoners a new sense of 
discipline, but maybe after complet- 
ing the program ihey can return to a 
normal life in society. 

Another alternative would be to 
execute anyone who is sentenced to 
life in prison. This would probably 
be the most effective solution for a 
couple of reasons. The first reason is 
simply because people would know 
exactly whai was going to happen to 



them if Ihey were convicted and sen- 
tenced to life The second reason for 
choosing this alternative would be 
the countless amount of money 
saved. If the people did not have io 
pay for ihe criminals in prison, the 
government could put the money 
loward benefitting the people in 
society who do not break the law. 

Yes, there is a serious problem 
with the way the jailing system in 
our country is operated, but iherc are 
a few solutions io this problem. If 
this money went to the law-abiding 
citizens, it could be used in a variety 
of ways. These valuable alternatives 
range from giving young children a 
recreational building to helping a 
college student pay for school. How 
can our government justify their 
needless spending on these convict- 
ed criminals? The (act is simply that 
they cannot Do you want your 
money being spent to support a con- 
victed criminal, or would you rather 
see a person who really needs help 
benefit from your tax money?

Orthman eases into IPSGA's top spot 

New president sees summer as opportunity to get organized 



by Scott Warden 
Editor- In-Chief 

The walls in his office were 
nearly bare, except for the iwo fra- 
ternity plaques hanging opposite his 
desk. His shelves were barren and 
the original furniture remained in 
the room. His desk was uncluttered. 

It was obvious that there hadn't 
been much time to settle in, 

Both his feci and his name plate 
were, however, on his desk in the 
Northwest corner of Walb He 
glanced through committee after 
committee and pondered over who, 
if anyone, would be available to fill 
each spot 

After being sworn in a few 
weeks ago, Kevin Orthman was eas- 
ing inio his first official day as 
Student Body President on Monday. 

His goals are set and bis agenda 



is clear -- at least for the summer. 

"I'm just trying to get everyone 
organized over the summer. I want 



cems during slow-paced summer is 
to fill the open committee spots as 
much as possible, preparing every- 

one for the fall 

semester. 

"I just 
want to get 
morale back 
up and make 
sure that 
everyone 
knows that 
we're ready to 
go forward 
instead of 
standing still 
or going back- 
wards. 

Orthman 

to go into the year with a team that is knows that his job is going to be an 

going to push forward and make up-hill climb. He has decided to set 

sure that we're all on the same page." as many obtainable goals as he and 

One of Orthman's main con- his staff can 



"I'm just trying to get everyone 
organized over the summer. I 
want to go into the year with a 

team 

that is going to push forward 

and make sure that we're all on 

the same page, " 




IPSGA President Kevin Orthman works diligently in his office during his first day on the job 



"Obviously my agenda isn't 
going to be completely set," 
Orthman said. "If an issue comes up 
and it's important to the students, of 
course I'm going to strive for it, but 
there are certain things that need to 
get done first and foremost." 

While discussing the campus' 
main problems, the newly elected 
president spoke out on the lack of 
communication between administra- 
tion, student government and the 
students. 

"There are a lot of services that 
this campus has that most of the stu- 
dents don't even know about. There 
are things on this campus that can 
help you get though school much 
easier if the students both know 
about them and take advantage of 
the programs. 

"There are services such as 
working on your lime management 
and leadership skills. The school 
puts the programs together and it's 
your money, so you might as well 
try to take full advantage of every- 
thing being offered." 

Along with the lack of commu- 
nication, Orthman knows that the 
campus could be more of a college 
atmosphere and has bad meetings 
with the admini strait on and athletic 
department on the subject and how 
to correct it 

"Right now I can't tell the stu- 
dents what they want, and since we 
have such a diverse population of 
students on campus, not all students 
are looking for things to do, they're 
looking for services as well." 

Soon he will fill his shelves and 
hang things on his walls. Soon he 
will setde into both his office and his 
job. And now he is the voice of the 
students. 

"I just hope that I can be a ser- 
vice for the students, because that's 
my job. I don't necessarily have a 
bigger voice than the average stu- 
dent, bui I do have connections to 
people who do. 

"We as a campus should be the 
voice of the students."

PICKef 



I might not have a gang of idiots 10 confer 
with like my counterpart, so I decided that I'd have to 
attempt to go through this editor's picks alone. 

We all have that one favorite movie that 
seemingly nobody else on the planet has seen or 
beard of. It's kind of like our little secret. The conver- 
sation always ends with us acting surprised too. 

And I'm not saying that I'm the only person 
who's seen these flicks. But what I am saying, is that 
you probably haven't. 

The first one ranks up there with the best 
movies of all time. It's just too bad that hardly anyone 
saw it. 

The next just left the theaters after a lengthy 
stay of three whole weeks. I'm pretty sure thai about 
four people saw this movie, and I saw it twice if that's 
any indication of the attendance records that it set 

"Grosse Pointe Blank" stars lohn Cusak. 
who plays a professional hit man, who is is coerced to 
return to his home town for his 10-year high school 
reunion. While he's there, be meets the girl he hasn't 
seen since he stood her up the night of the senior 
prom. Cusak is amazing as is his love interest Minnie 
Driver. 

Next on the list is going back to the mid- 
eighties. "Tough Enough" stars a young and chiseled 
Dennis Quaid who plays a boxer/singer who enters a 
local "Tough Man" contest. He knocks the hell out of 
men twice his size. He doesn't do it for the love of the 
sport, however, he does it for the love of his music. 
The flick is full of blood and bruises, but done taste- 
fully It's hard to beat the "Singing tough man." 

One of the all-time classics from my child- 
hood is "Clash of the Titans," The film is a mytholog- 
ical journey of Medusa, Pegasus and Cyclops. It's 
actually one of the first movies that I remember see- 
ing over and over again. 

Finally, "Real Genius" stars a young and 
hilarious Val Kilmer, who plays an extremely smart 
college student who is working ori the world's most 
powerful laser. Next to another little-seen movie, 
" fop Secret." ibis is Kilmer's best role 



Plenty to do in Fort Wayne to enrich culture 



by Sara Valentine 
Photo Editor 

When recently engaged in con- 
versation with a fellow who attend- 
ed high school with me, I was slight- 
ly angered and frustrated lo hear 
him say thai Fori Wayne seriously 
lacks culture and entertainment. 1 
promptly accused him of laziness 
because there are lots of things to do 
in Fort Wayne and I felt that he just 
wasn't even trying to find anything. 

I am tired of people always say- 
ing that Fort Wayne is boring and 
thai looking for entertainment is just 
loo much of a burden. We all know 
that Fort Wayne is not the pinnacle 
of cily life or an entertainment 
mecca, bui it's no Hicksville either. 

For starters, we^havc the ballet, 
the philharmonic and theatre which 
can occupy much lime by them- 
selves, for those who arc interested 
in being a litlle more cultured. 

There's always something 
going on at the Embassy and (he 



atmosphere of the historic building 
is breathtaking in itself. Anything 
from classic movie showings to 
Broadway musicals to Barry 
Manilow concerts are performed on 
the newly-renovaied stage. 

If you didn'i know, our zoo is 
one of the top in uie nation. Sure the 
place is labeled as a Children's Zoo, 
but that just means thai if you bap- 
pen io be a child you can have a 
good time there, loo. It has the 
largest' indoor orangutan exhibit in 
the world and seeing a liger up close 
and personal is simply awe-inspir- 



ing. Jack Hannah, director of the 
Columbus Zoo and well-known 
television personality ranks our very- 
own zoo among his top 5 

We have museums! Have you 
been to the expanded Lincoln 
Museum yet? Il is the largest and 
most complete museum about the 
16th president around and it's in 
Fort Wayne! Il even has the gun that 
shot the fatal bullet as well as (he 
letter that convinced *ol Abe to grow 
whiskers. 

The Cinema Center offers greai 
escape from the typical, happy-end- 



ing, mainstream flicks. Il can be 
really refreshing to see movies 
about taboo topics or intriguing 
ideas. Movies that make you think? 
Yes. Besides, IPFW students can get 
in at a student rate upon presentation 
of a student ID. I haven't been dis- 
appointed with a movie there yet. I 
wish 1 could say the same about the 
last film 1 saw at Coventry 13. 
Bigger ain't better in this case, kids. 
Now there's absolutely no 
excuse for anyone to be silling at 
home complaining of a bad case of 
boredom.

Lesson learned during weekend match 




Scott 
Warden 



6446 mevt&amp;i 



I learned a valuable lesson on 
the tennis courts of Swinney Park 
Saturday. 

Tennis is by far my favorite 
spon to play. And I won't lie to you, 
it's because I'm not too bad at it, but 
I've got a bit of a problem with my 
mental game, or should I say my 
mental stability, while I'm on the 
court 

I guess that I've always had a 
problem looking back. I just love to 
compete, and I'm one of those peo- 
ple who isn't great at any one partic- 



ular sport, but 
can compete at 
a high level in 
many of them. 
Tennis is 
by far my best, 
but I digress. 

So back 
to my little 
problem. We 
all know those 
kids who sit in 
front of the TV 
and just 
absolutely 
bawl their eyes 
out because 
they lost a bard-fought game of 
MarioKan or because the pitching 
machine struck them out in their 
Little League game or their dad beat 
the snot out of them every time they 
played one-on-one in the driveway. 
Well that was me ten years ago. 
You might think that I'm a wee- 
nie, and I've heard the phrase, "It's 
only a game," thousands of times in 
the span of my 20 years. But it's not 
just a game and it's not just for fun. 
It's to prove that I'm better than you. 



I have gotten considerably bet- 
ter over the years in most fields of 
competition, and only have three 
that I still get monstrously pissed 
when I lose. MarioKan is still on the 
list and the others are pool and. welt, 
tennis. 

Normally I'm not such a bad 
person, if I might be so modest, but 
when I'm competing, or should I say 
when I'm losing, you just don't want 
to be around me Neither does my 
opponent. 

I know that a lot of people prob- 
ably can't understand why in the hell 
someone would take a simple game 
so seriously, but I'll try to explain. 

I know I can win That might 
sound cocky, and it probably is, but 
each time I step on the court, rack 
the balls or turn on my Nintendo. I 
know mat if 1 give my all that I can 
beat you. 

So back to the hard courts at 
Swinney, where the problem came 
to a bead as I hit with my gimpy- 
legged father, who is just as compet- 
itive as I am, only his mind is sharp- 
er. 

I learned everything I know 



about tennis from him. so it proba- 
bly shouldn't surprise me that when 
healthy, tin.- man can still give me a 
run and even take a set now and 
then. But he's twice my age with 
bone spurs in his foot, a bad hip and 
two knees that have been through 
arthroscopic surgery. But what he 
lacks in physical prowess, he makes 
up for by taking the game off of the 
court and pulling it in my head. 

After taking the first set 6-3, I 
was pretty confident, as usual, but as 
my game started to slip, so did my 
head. I started to lose it. 

I normally don't cuss — too 
much, anyway — in front of dad, 
but on the court that social rule goes 
out the window. I figure as long as I 
don't cuss at him I should be fine. 



But between that and heaving my 
racket countless limes, dad was get- 
ting a litde more than frustrated with 
his little boy. or his 20-year-old son 
who was acting like one. 

Another part of my problem. 
the biggest in dad's eyes, is that I 
don't give credit or compliment him 
on good shots. I don't think he's ever 
hit a winner If it gets by me. it's 
never because of his skill, but 
always because of my lack of skill. 

So the score is 4-5 in the second 
set and the old man with two bad 
wheels drills a cross-court forehand 
wide and I stretched out to make 
contact, but my racket wasn't long 
enough, so to punish it, I threw the 
damn thing into the next court. 

After my tirade, I see dad start 



packing up his gear getting ready to 
leave and 1 wondered if I had the 
score wrong and if the set was over. 
I didn't, but he had made the deci- 
sion, as he had done dozens of times 
before, that he'd had enough of my 
antics — again. 

We were both hot, sweaty, tired 
and pissed at one another. Me, 
because even though he was up 5-4, 
I actually had him right where I 
wanted him And him, because 
another fun day of tennis had turned 

But I learned a lesson on 
Saturday 

The moral is this: Don't piss off 
your father when you have to sit in a 
steaming car in silence for the 15- 
minute drive home. 



Coach sells IPFW 



A sunburn and knowledge 
about life and baseball aren't the 
only things thai I look away from a 
weekend speni with baseball coach 
Tony Vitlorio. 

I took away a new-found 
respect for noi only the time and 
effort that Vitlorio puts into the job 
that he loves, but I took also took 
away a different perspective on 
IPFW as a campus and a communi- 

Somutimes we forget why it is 
we've come to IPFW to further our 
education. Most would say that it's 
cheaper than going off to school, or 
that they're planning on transferring 
after ayearor two. 'i's, * 

But sometimes we XgmA people 
to remind us what this institution is, 
and can be like. 

1 spent Saturday and Sunday 
watching, listening and talking to 
Vitlorio about baseball and IPFW 
— two things he obviously holds 
dear. 

Two things he was selling this 
weekend as he hit the recruiting 
trail. 

Saturday morning I met him 
along with baseball coaches from 
Manchester College and Indiana 
Tech at Northrop for the Brains' 
doubleheader againsi Warsaw High 
School 



With the other coaches. Vitlorio 
watched "His boys," as he pointed 
out what the kid on the mound was 
doing right and wrong while clock- 
ing the batter's lime from home to 
first. 

He'd take his slop watch from 
his left hand and show the numbers 
to his two brothers in the fraiemity 
of coaching. 

"We don't have any reason to 
hide anything." said Viltorio. "I 
know that they're there looking at 
some of the same players as I am, 
but I can confidently say to 'em, 
Tou may be looking at him. bui I'm 
gonna get him.' " 

After the second inning of 
game two. coach and 1 traveled back 
to his office in Gates, where he was 
meeting a junior college , player 
looking lo transfer Obviously not 
here, though, as Viuorio and I wait- 
ed on the kid for nearly an hour. 

Sunday, however. Viltorio had 
another junior college kid come in 
for a visit. A 6-foot, 3-inch left 
handed pitcher from Ohio, who 
brought his parents with him as they 
watched, listened and talked to 
Vntono about baseball and IPFW. 

Coach knows his job is lo sell 
both. The customer was the man- 
child with the golden left arm and 
his parents, but Viltorio sold IPFW 



"Number one is a degree from 
Indiana University or Purdue 
University. It doesn't say IPFW on 
your degree. Number two is our 
conference. The GLVC is the sec- 
ond best Division II conference in 
the country Number three is 
Canterbury Green Apartments and 
number four is Memorial Stadium.'' 

We ended the meeting and the 
weekend on the right-field side of 
Memorial Stadium during the fifth 
inning of Sunday's Wizards' game. 
The parents looked in awe at the 
4.500 fans, probably imagining that 
each individual was screaming for 
their son. 

With a hand shake and an 
exchange of phone numbers we all 
left. His decision was still up in the 
air. 

Bui I was sold.
