Biographer presents success story

Audrey T. McCluskcy spoke ai 
IPFW on Monday about Mary Mc- 
Clcod Bcihunc, ihc dynamic female 
founder of Bcihune-Cookman Col- 
lege in Daylona, Rorida. McCluskey, 
assisiani professor of Afro-Amcfican 
studies and women's studies at Indi- 
ana Univer^iiy. Btoomingion. stud- 
ied Beihune's life for tier doctoral 
disscnaiion. 

"There was a silence about her 
IBelhune] in feminist studies. The si- 
lence intrigued me," said McCtuskey. 

Bethune, one of 17 children bom to 
former slaves in 1875, believed in ed- 
ucation for herself and others. After 
the Civil War, the Frecdmiin's Bureau 
established several schools for Afro- 
Americans, Criticism and terrorist at- 
tacks from white southerners interest- 
ed in keeping Afro- Americans unedu- 
cated and oppressed were common. 
Schools were often burned down by 
members of the Ku Klux Klan and 
other while supremist groups. Lynch- 
ings occurred repeatedly. 

In spite of all of this, the Afro- 
American community was intent on 
education, both vocational and acade- 
mic, and schools continued growing. 



"Black women were ottrcmely pas- 
sionate about education for them- 
selves and their children." said 
McOuskcy. 

After attending Scotia Seminary in 
Concordia, N.C.. and the Moody 
Bible Academy. Bethune taught at 
various schools. Her experience with 
the curriculum ai Scotia of practical 
and academic education molded her 
ideas for her own future school 
curriculum. 

Bethune was described by her biog- 
rapher as a "zealous fcminisl." She 
formed the Daytona Industrial School 
for Girls and with the combined 
grass-roots efforts of the Afro-Ameri- 
can community, she began a school of 
domestic science and academics. 

Bethune believed and practiced diat 
it was up to Afro-American women 
to '■uplift the race." 

After one of her students became il! 
with appendicitis and was not accept- 
ed at any of the "white" hospitals for 
ireaimeni. Beihunc began her own 
hospital with nursing education at the 
school. She gradually added lo the 
curriculum, eventually expanding it 
to the present day Bethune-Cookman 
College. 

Beihunc's motto was "We special- 
ize in the wholly impossible," 



Proving politically astute, Bethune 
became president of the Rorida State 
Teacher's Association in 1917. the 
vice -president of the National Urban 
League, and the director of the Youth 
Works Administration. She was an in- 
formal adviser to President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt during his terms in 
office. 

McCluskcy summarized her lecture: 
"Mary McLeod Bethune inspired 
generations of African American men 
and women to do more, achieve more 
and expect more." 

McCluskey has also accomplished 
much. She introduced the first courw 
in the United States on black women 
writers in 1973. and has lectured and 
written numerous anicles, essays, and 
book reviews on the subjects of 
women and Afro-Americans. Her 
current research interests include 
philanthropy, race, and gender in edu- 
cation; black women school founders, 
and single-sex academies. 

The sponsors for this event were the 
Center for Women and Returning 
Adults and Multicultural Services. 

Linda Johnson, director of the Cen- 
tex said, "We are lucky to have 
her speak. She is a very dynairtic 



speaker."

All-American Lady 'Don 

IPFW honors Basketball standout 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

For the first time in IPFW athletic 
history, a jersey was retired (actually 
two). 

Both jerseys were retired in honor 
of Lady 'Dons basketball alumna 
Lisa Miller during half time of the 
men's Mastodons game on Thurs- 
day, Feb. 25. 

The jerseys were presented by 
Amie Ball, athletic director. Joanne 
Lantz, chancellor of IPFW. and spe- 
cial guest, Hiiliard Gates. 

The first jersey was presented in 
the name of the university and will 
be hung in the Hiiliard Gales Sports 
Center. 

The second jersey was given by 
Gales to Miller for her own benefit. 

Miller broke 13 IPFW records. 
nine Great Lakes Valley Conference 
(GLVC) records and three national 
Division II records during her four- 
year stay at IPFW. 




Her career at IPFW gained national 
attention when stic was named lo the 
Division II All-Ameiican team dur- 
ing her senior year. 

"It is exciting and it's a great hon- 
or," said Miller. "1 just feel really 
blessed with the tcammaics I've had 



over the four years," 

Miller also thanks the suppon of 
this year's Lady "Dons, Coach 
Eileen Kleinfellcr, and the faculty 
and administration at IPFW. 

"I feel very fortunate to have 
played for the IPFW program." said 
Miller. 

Miller didn't hold her talent to ba; 
keiball, she also tried her hand i 
Lady "Dons softball while at IPFW. 

Kleinfelter. Miller's basketball 
coach last year, felt that her conlri' 
bution to the team came not only 
from her play, but also from her spir- 
it and enthusiasm for the team and 
the game. 

Kleinfelter is grateful for the assis' 
tancc in coaching and recruiting that 
Miller has given this season as an 
assistant coach; and acknowledges 
the exposure that Miller has given 
the Lady 'Dons program. 

"It's not everyday that you w 
have the opportunity to honor an 
All-American," said Kleinfeliei,

New campus minister plans to stay 



Hill supports patriotism, diversity 



By Laura Lineback. Chief Reporter 

and 

Felicia Beeching, Editor In chief 

Class, gender, and race intertwined 
with patriotism was the topic of ihc 
speech given by Anita Hill on Tues- 
day evening. Feb. 23. at Purdue 
University. 

IPFW's Center for Women and Re- 
luming Adults and ihc Women's 
Studies department collaborated to 
pass out free tickets and provide 
transportation to anyone who desired 
to attend the event. 

Hill, the University of Oklahoma 
law professor who testified in the 
Clarence Thomas senate confirmation 
hearings, addressed an audience of 
over 10.000 at West Lafayette, and 
stressed the need of Americans to 
deal with multiple discriminations. 

"We need to provide incentives for 
the idea of diversification. We need to 
punish harmful intolerance and big- 
otry." said Hill. 

"If patriotism means anything, sure- 
ly it means working to sec that all 
live equal educational opportunitiei 
in this couniry." said Hill. 

"Racism denies us the opportuni- 
ty to be a tniiy diverse country 
and prevents both racists and its 
victims from becoming mie pairi-

ois." Hill emphasized. 

Poveny brings about a discrimina- 
tion which prevents individuals and 
families from receiving basic ser- 
vices, from health care to education, 
according to Hill. 

Hill noted that every effort for so- 
cial chance, from women's suffrage 
to the civil rights movement, was in- 
stigated by people, and ihc govern- 
ment followed suit. It was not the 
otho' way around. 

"We cannoi continue to rely on the 
federal govemmeni to solve those 
problems." she said. 



Hili also spoke on the subject of 
sexual harassment for women in em- 
ployment and education. She believes 
that legal punishment and the new 
federal law that provides monetary 
compensation for victims is a step in 
the right direction. "Sexual harass- 
mem is learned behavior; it can be 
unlearned." Hill sffongly emphasized. 

She exhorted young people to be 
prepared to deal with discrimina- 
tion because of class, gender, and 
racial diversity. 

Discussing the issues and meeting 
those who have suffered arc ways to 
bring atwut change. This is how the 
problem of sexual harassment has 
been confronted. Universities are of- 
fering extra credit courses and noon- 
lime seminars across the coimiry to 
address discrimination issues. 

"We are now addressing the sexual 
harassment issue openly. Now it's 
time we stop denying race and class 
issues and address ihem openly." 
said Hill. 

Hill concluded her speech by point- 
ing out the positive aspects of differ- 
ences in America. 

"We are all patriots in our diversity. 
noi despite it. Let us embrace the idea 
of diversity and the idea of patriotism 
- they are not in conflia."

Fori Wayne-South Bend Diocese. 
Martin is from the order of the Poor 
Handmaids of Jesus Christ and ar- 
rives at IPFW having worked at Man- 
chester College previously. Martin al- 
so has experience as a special reli- 
gious education teacher in Chicago. 
Her present job responsibilities in- 
clude working at IPFW as well as 
Indiana Itch. 

"The reason I am in campus min- 
istry is because of those who helped 
me while 1 was in college by support- 
ing, listening, and encouraging me to 
search out the answers to all of my 
questions." said Martin. "I may not 
have all of the answers, but I am a 
good listener," 

Manin hopes to be able lo find die 
needs of this campus and help further 
the Catholic Campus Ministry as well 
as provide more services for 
Catholics, and help anyone she can,

ID card lo sec me," Manin stated. 




Sister Msrybeth Martin 



The Catholic Campus Ministry be- 
gan with Father Larry Kramer in 
1986. Although he didn't have an or- 
ganization behind him, he spent lime 
walking around campus, talking to 
students, and trying to meei their 
needs. When Bishop John D'Arcy 
was appointed over the Fort Wayne- 
South Bend Diocese, he became in- 



terested in establishing an organized 
Catholic Campus Ministry at IPFW 
as well as on other area campuses. 

D'Arcy was heavily involved with 
college minismes while in die Boston 
area and after a survey done m 1986 
believed that ii would be beneficial to 
Stan the ministry in Fori Wayne. 
D'Arcy's organized effort began in 
1987 with the opening of the office 
now located m die Helmke Library. 
Room 364. 

The first campus minister to head 
the "official" Catholic Ministry here 
was Sister Patty Huffman, who minis- 
tered here for three years before mov- 
ing on to other ministries. She was 
followed by Steve Bromberek who 
came here with a bachelor's degree 
from Pontifical College Josephinium 
and ministered to students for two 
years. 

Martin joined the ministry staff at 
IPFW in late January and plans to 
Slay for a while, furthering the Cam- 
pus Ministry and fulfilling her goal to 
help others. To reach Martm go to- 
any campus phone and call extension 
6993 or 6994. Her office hours are 
Wednesday through Fridays, 9 ajn. to 
3:30 pJn.

Letters to the editor 



Theatre patrons excluded from dedication 



To the Editor: 

hi the February-March 1993 issue 
of The An Scene — that newspaper 
produced by the IPFW School of Fme 
and Performing Arts— an article ap- 
peared announcing the "dedication 
gala" of the new TTieaier Arts build- 
ing. The dedication, which will take 
place on April 16, features a single 
performance by the nationally-ac- 
claimed actress, Claire Bloom. 

To the many theater patrons on this 
campus and the surrounding commu- 
nity, not 10 mention the students on 
this campus, many of whom have 
dedicated countless hours to the suc- 
cess of our Theater Depanment, this 
announcement might have been met 
with great jubilation. After all. unlike 
many university campuses, IPFW is 
notorious for its paucity of providing 
nationally knowm enienajners. 

Unfortunately, there will be no 
cause for celebration among those 
who have contributed their talents, 
sweat, and support to making the new 
Theater Arts facility a reality, as the 
ticket price to the dedication is 
SIOO.OO, yes SIOO.OO per ticket, thus 



excluding most individuals and cer- 
tainly every student from participa- 
tion in, or attending this celebration. 

Over the course of the past quarter- 
century, not only students, but faculty 
members and this city's theater pa- 
trons have continuously supported 
OUT Theater Department by purchas- 
ing tickets to attend the student per- 
formances in the former theater locat- 
ed in the basemeni of Keltler Hall, 
They paid their money for the privi- 
lege of silting on broken and dilapi- 
dated folding clLurs placed on aeaky 
wooden platforms while suffering 
through a cacophonous sound system 
and an antiquated lighting system 
which could (and did) unexpectedly 
plunge the theater into total darkness. 
While those of us who faithfully sup*- 
ported the theater program came to 
expect eitcellent and award-winning 
performances, we also felt that our 
ticket purchase was a way of invest- 
ing in the future of the theater 
program. 

Well, the future has been realized 
through a growing theater department 
and a new multi-million dollar the- 



ater. But the only thanks offered those 
of us who for over twenty-live years 
have pledged our support is to now 
be excluded from that future we 
helped build. Likewise, the students 
on this campus whose tuitions helped 
build the new Theater Arts facility 
have been excluded. 

So. to Sieven Sanaiore, Chair of the 
Theater Department, I say shame on 
you for supporting this dedication 
which is a slap in the face to the very 
students and community members 
who helped you build your depan- 
ment. To Abe Basseii, Dean of the 
School of Fme and Performing Arts, 1 
say shame on you for proposing this 
dedication which serves no purpose 
other than to further the elitist image 
of the Theater Department and pro- 
vide you self-aggrandizement paid 
for by others. And. finally, to Chan- 
cellor JoArme Lantz, 1 say shame on 
you for allowing the effective exclu- 
sion of the student body ("your stu- 
dents" as you are so fond of saying) 
from participating in the celebration 
of an event that they helped make a 
reality. 



Abe Bassett has stepped-down as 
Dean of the School of Fme and Per- 
forming Arts. Chancellor Laniz will 
soon be siepping-out from her posi- 
tion due to retirement. That leaves, 
among the three progenitors of the 
dedicadon debacle, only Sieven Sar- 
ratorc who I assume will continue 
stepping-on students as he has done 
in this incident. 

Tliis student, this patron, and this 
member of the Theater Department , 
will certainly re-think his commit- 
ment to Purdue -Indiana Theaicr (PIT) 
and will reconsider before making the 
sacrifice of spending six nights a 
week until 11:00 PM for two months 
at a time and with a loss of pay of 
hundreds of dollars simply to put on a 
production in a Theater Depanment 
which regards me and others with 
such obvious contempt,

Taxing issue 

Visionaries probe economic future 



To the Editor: 

Top ten things most likely to hap- 
pen under Clinton's tax increase, 

10, Clinton will achieve what com- 
munism has failed to accomplish — a 
one-class system of poor peasants. 

9. For the first time in American 
history Haidan immigrants will erru- 
gratc back to Haiti slating, "I thought 
I had it bad over there." 

8, Clinton the tax man and Gore 
the environmentalist will create a rev- 
olutionary new deficit reduction pro- 
gram in which they tax the air we 
breathe. 

7, Boris Yeltsin will extend eco- 



nomic aid to the United States as a 
gesture of good will, 

6, The "thousand points of light" 
will be out of reach to most Ameri- 
cans after being heavily taxed under 
Clinton's energy proposal, 

5. The liberal media will somehow 
find a way to blame the next four 
years' economic disasu;r on the Re- 
publicans or Rush Limbaugh, even 
though the Democrats run everything, 

4. The Democrats, sympathizing 
with the American taxpayer, will only 
take a 15 percent increase in pay 
and one federally paid nip to the 
Bahamas, 



3. The deficit won't decrease, but 
we will gel one hell of a nice running 
track around the White House for 
Clinton. 

2. The American dollar is replaced 
by the higher valued peso. 

1. The Democrats will proclaim 
him a miracle worker because he was 
able to get us out of the "recession" 
three weeks after he took office. And 
it will only be a miracle that we won't 
shde back in.

Play trashed 

To the Editor 

The recent Purdue-Indiana The- 
ater production of "Boy's Life" wa; 
full of "four letter words and the 
actions" that go with them. The ac- 
tors did their pans well enough bui 
the play was trash. With this kind 
of production, (die first play of the 
series was about of the same cal- 
iber) it's no woTuler the attendance 
is so poor. The play bill said that 
there would tw no intermission and 
that vras a smart decision as it prob- 
ably would noi have t&gt;ecn necessary

Spring Break good antidote for existentialism 




Misery, Despair. Hairctl. Fear. Vio- 
lence, Dcaih Rush Limbaugh. 

Maybe we arc already in hell. 
Maybe wc were placed on iliis Earth 
[0 live shallow, meaningless lives 
filled wiih monoiony, drudgery, and 
pain. Plagued wiih cmpiy hopes, wc 
wander aimlessly [hrough a petty exis- 
tence, scavenging for any kind of 
chcip happiness lo 
clljig to. Our repeated 
misiakes and misjudg- 
menis combined with 
circumsianccs beyond 
our coniroi lead to 
failed aspirations, bro- 
ken dreams, and shat- 
tered delusions of fui- 
rillmcni, Wc eventually 
resort to living vicari- 
ously through people 
who we think are hap- 
py. And the only cer- 
tainty on this God-for- 
saken rock is that we'll 
never gel out alive. 

I'm sorry for that outburst of nega- 
tivity, I've been feeling a bit cynical 
lately. It's late February, it's five de- 
grees out. my Recbolts arc covered 
with snow, there are black icicles 
hanging from my car, the pothole- 
laden streets are lined with piles of 
ugly black snow, I can't feci my face, 
and i}ie biting cold wind has mussed 
my hair. My car, whose mufficr fell 
off less than 24 hours after it had a 
S250 fuel pump transplant, is taking 
longer and longer to start each morn- 
ing. I'm feeling just a bit cynical. 



Jus! A Theory 
by Tim Schreiber 



What 1 need is a vacation. I need to 
gel away from this miserable oonhcm 
Indiana weather, I need to Lake some 
time off from my three jobs, two 
classes, and one lame hunk-of-mctal 
excuse for a car. 

And ! plan to do just thai. Spring 
Break couldn't be comitig at a better 
time for me. I have big plans. 

My brother. Dan, and 
his wife, Jill, have gen- 
erously invited me 
along with them on 
their vacation. So this 
Spring Break. I plan to 
lose my troubles in the 
tropical paradise 
of.-Washington. D.C. 
OK, so it's not Fort 
Lauderdale. But it's not 
Fon Wayne, cither. 

We're going to D.C, 
for the same reason that 
people go to places like 
Duluih, Dcs Moinc, or 
West Virginia for vaca- 
tion: free lodging. Dan and Jill have 
friends in the D.C. area, and we can 
mooch off ihcm for a few days until 
ihcy throw us out on the street like un- 
employed nephews. 

Also, Dan and Jill are hosting a Ger- 
man exchange student (Almut) and 
she wanted to see the heart of this 
great bureaucracy wc call America 
while she's here. Perhaps we'll get to 
see an interesting and educational 
governmental scandal while we're 
there. It would be nice if we could buy 
a senator for Almut for the week. Un- 



Column infuriates explicator 



To Ihe Editor: 

I'm a literary cxphcaior and I'm so 
upset I could bake souiTlcs until to- 
morrow — in an earthquake — and 
my anger would fester no further; I 
sit scorned. You, Tom Schreiber, 
mocked my career, my profession, 
and my life. You bastardized the 
fruits of my passion — piety, glory, 
and the right to promote those 
miniature clip-on lamps for bedtime 
reading. 

In the future, consider the lives you 
may effectively ruin with your pcr- 
sccutious pen. Once content with my 
prestigious community status and 
fine French wine (preferably an airy. 



full-Oavorcd while zinfandel), your 
column reduced me to an impalpable 
zymogen. Just because I thoroughly 
enjoy literary explication I am ob- 
sessed? Pie ability to interpret read- 
ing material is an an. Let's see you, 
Tom Schreiber, explicate road signs 
successfully enough lo avoid being 
ticketed by Interstate Police, 

By the way, Fuzzy Wuzzy isn't a 
bear at all. It's a vat of matured rec- 
tal cheese.

fonunaiely. Dan Quayle is no longer 
in Washington, and we probably 
couldn't afford anyone else. But 
maybe we'll get involved in a wacky 
spy caper, and we'll stumble upon 
some microfilm and get chased by 
men with bad Russian accents and 
save the country from certain doom 
with the help of a secret FBI agent 
named Kip, tike in a bad "Laveme &amp; 
Shirley" made-for-TV movie. 

So, as you can sec, Washington docs 
have the potential for great fun. 

Another opportunity for great fun on 
my impending vacation is the "family 
car ride." Seeing as how D.C. is sever- 
al hundred miles away from Fort 
Wayne, this will be the kind of vaca- 
tion where we spend large amounts of 
time locked in 3 car,.. together. 

Dan and Jill are really fun people, 
despite the fact that they own a poo- 
dle. And Almut, who understands 
English but still thinks I'm funny, is 
also enjoyable company. But being 
locked in a 5' by 8' companmcnt for 
too many hours with anyone can drive 
a person baity, 

I have foreseen the potential for 
boredom and irritation here, so I plan 
to bring along my harmonica. With 
my current musical arsenal consisting 
entirely of "When the Saints Go 
Marching In" and "Happy Birthday," I 
plan to entertain my fellow iiavelers 
with hours of harmonic amani a. Also, I 
have vowed to learn every song in my 
"Bob Dylan Songbook" on the tnp. 

You can sec the amount of planning 
that has to go into such a week of fun. 



In this case, the fun is very imponani, 
t}ccausc I'm counting on it to cure my 
existential isriL 

Around these pans, they say that 
March comes in like a lion and out 
like a Iamb. So what happens if March 
comes in like a black cKhaust&lt;ovcreiJ 
glacier? Will it come out like a 
Caribbean-blue tropical paradise? Will 
we find ourselves sipping huge tropi- 
cal drinks with large chunks of fruit 



and tiny umbrellas in them to the tune 
of the Beatles "Here Cocnes ihc Sun" 
on April 1st? Only time will tell. 

But for the moment. 1 have more im- 
portant concerns. As soon as I get 
some feeling back in my hands and 
feet, I plan to pack, Wc arc going to 
have fun on this vacation, whether wc 
like it or noL 

Now. where did I put thai 
harmonica?

Storyteller 
captivates 
campus 

By Jennifer Ferry 
Surr writer 

The lerm "sioryieilcr" conjures ap 
images of a roclcing chair, a grancl- 
par6iity figuic. and a circle of wide- 
eyed children inienUy listening ai iheir 
fc«L Bobby Norfollt is a different kind 
ofsior&gt;icllcr, 

Lasi Friday evening Norfolk explod- 
ed into a full-body "Siory Theater" 
animation ■ captivating a filled to ca- 
pacity room of 'folk' ranging in phys- 
ical age from two to 62. The effect of 
Ihis engaging presence on ihe Walb 
Memorial Ballroom stage was that of 
a spring day in the midst of a long 
winter. The imagination, Norfolk says 
is "better than TV, the movies or u 
VCR," and if that's not enough to stll 
you, it's even "portable and right be- 
tween your ears." 

The imagination is taken by the 
shoulders and shaken loose from the 
reality of daily life. This "Bobby Mc- 
Ferrin" of the folk lale world uses his 
voice as an instrument to lead every- 
one from their worries and make them 
happy. 

Sounds from a creaky door in the 
story of a little girl who Icams a scary 
lesson through a visit from a ghost in 
her nightmare, to a Chinese gong in a 
story describing what a dragon really 
looks like. 

Norfolk's colorful pantomime punc- 
tuates the stories and helps him bring 
home the lessons. 

His stories touch children of all 
ages. The adventures Norfolk brought 
10 life will no doubt be held dear by 
ihose who experienced the magic of 
his tales. As he continues iravelling 
and sharing, he will undoubiable 
touch many more folks.

AND THE WINNER IS... 



By Kent Jakway, 
Footprints Editor 

It's been two weeks since [ first 
ttiallenged the readers of this paper to 
come up with a new. exciting name 
for this, my section. This challenge 
has inspired many lo great degrees 
of inspiration (ya, right!) to the 
point thai Spam has become the 
official word of Keiiler's computer 
consultants. 

Many suggestions have been made 
111 me personally regarding thij and I 
vM'ulil like 10 thank my loyal readers 
(jll 10 of you) for helping me make 
ihis choice. After much considcra- 
lion, 1 have to say that unfortu- 



nately. I cannui call this section 
Spam because thai might be con- 
sidered "unprofessionaJ," 

I also ruled out 'Maps' simply be- 
cause it's Spam spelled backwards. 
Footprints is out because everyone 
with the possible exception of the 
chief editor is sick of it. Spam Foot- 
prints is deliniiely out! 

Features will most likely be the new 
title for this page unless someone can 
get me a new name thai meets the fol- 
lowing requirements: 

1 , Has some form of professional 
dignity to it. Footprints has this qual- 
ity, but Spam completely lacks it. 

2. It should have some originality 
to it. Footprints and Spam arc very 



onginal: Spam Footprints isn't. 

3, It should be shon enough to fit 
on the top of the page and leave plen- 
ty of room for the date, page, and 
having THE COMMUNICATOR 
across the cotter top. 

4. Most important of all, since this 
is my section of the paper. I have to 
like it. I like Spam (the name, not the 
product), but I don't like Footprints. 

If anyone can get me a really good 
answer by the week after spring 
break. I will reward them with free 
pizia from the m%\ Senate Affairs 
Forum. Sony, but you must attend the 
forum to claim your prize. 



Novelist to present public reading 



By Jeri Donnelly 
Staff Writer 

Gladys Swan, author of the novel, 
"Ghost Dance: A Play of Voices." 
presents a free public reading of her 
work tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the Walb 
Memorial Union. Room 224. 

This reading by Swan, associate 
professor of English at the University 
of Missouri at Columbia, is pan of 
IPFW English and Linguistics Visit- 
ing Writer series. 

"Ghost Dance is a novel that re- 
volves around a famous director and 



actress who travel to a small New 
Mexico mining town to promote a 
film," says Swan. "The novel ex- 
plores the community life in the 
town, which is similar to the area in 
New Mexico where I grew up." 

Swan plans to read portions of 
"Ghost Dance" as well as from her 
short story collections. 

Swan considers herself primarily a 
shoti story writer and has published 
three collections, most recently, "Do 
You Believe in Cabeza de Vaca?" She 
has also written a novel, "Carnival tor 
the Gods." 



"I often use New Mexico as a set- 
ting for my stories." said Swan. 

Swan has published essays and re- 
views and lectured frequently 
throughout the U.S. and foreign coun- 
tries. She is a past recipient of a mas- 
ter fellowship from the Indiana Arts 
Commission, a Lilly Endowment Fel- 
lowship, and a Fulbright Award to 
Yugoslavia. 

Swan will also conduct a fiction 
writing workshop on Friday, March 6 
for six student writcis previously 
chosen in a call for manuscripts in 
January.

International students share goals 



By Anita Stdnbacher 
Guest WrlUr 

Intcrnaiional studcnis at IPFW 
come from aJl over ihc world. Many 
di/fcrcni reasons have brought ihem 
10 this vicinity and this campus. Be- 
low arc the profiles of ihrec currem 
students studying ai IPFW. 

Pan L, Xiong is 3 me- 
chanical engineering tech- 
nology major on an F-1 
siudcni visa, from Shang- 
hai, China. He received a 
three-year diploma from 
China icn years ago. but 
there was no degree of- 
fered in China. 

On being asked why he 
chose Purdue Univcrsiiy, 
his reply was. "Purdue has 
a good reputation in China," 

Fan applied lo Wesi Lafayette and 
they scni him lo IPFW, He came with 
his wife and sixteen year old son. He 
lives with his family in an apanmeni 
close to the university. His wife is 
studying English on campus and his 
son is attending a local high school. 

When asked about his work situa- 
tion, Fan enplaincd that he is subject 



IPFW and is majoring in French. She in Calcuiia. He is in his sixth semes- 

aiiended vocational school and ler at IPFW, majoring in computer 

earned a baccalaureate diploma science. He is president of ihc Honors

o 



States. 

Delplanque's reasons for choosing 
IPFW are unusual. She came lo Fort 
Wayne for one year to Icam about the 
U.S. and 10 improve her 
English, She was auditing 
classes ai Norihside High 
School. 

When Delplanque ex- 
pressed an interest in slay- 
ing for college, her guid- 
ance counselor brought 
her to Dr. Phillip Kermeli, 
Director of International 
Student Services, and she 
was accepted at IPFW, 
Delplanque lived with an American 
family during that year. 
Her father in France want- 
ed her to stay in Fort 
Wayne during college be- 
cause she already had 
friends and acquaintances 
here. She agreed, and still 
lives with the same Amer- 
ican family, 
Delplanque's father is 



to the immigration rules, as an F-1 

student. The first two years, Fan making a great sacrifice to 
could only work on campus. He send her to college in the 
worked at Helmke Library, and sold 
popcorn. Since obtaining a work per- 
mit, he works for the Royal China 
ReslQurani at the Marketplace of Can- 
terbury. 

Pan admits that the first year was 
very tough, and he had problems un- 
derstanding the professors. 

Since there are so few intemaiional 
students here. Fan noted, "The pro- 
fessors tend to think of us the same as 
American students," 

He was referring to the difficulty he 
encountered with the language, but 
added, "They [professors) are so nice 
tome," 

In other areas. Fan has had no prob- 
lems. He has taken several remedial 
English courses, which have helped 
him tremendously. Fan plans to 
pursue an M.A. in manufacturing 
engineering. 

Fan finds the classes and students 
are very different from the universi- 
ties in China. He has not experienced 
the closeness and camaraderie that 
Chinese students arc accustomed to 
■receiving in their universi- 




lies and colleges, but if he 
needs help, his professors 
and classmates are happy 
to provide it. 

Of IPFW. Fan says, 'i 
think this campus is 
preuy good for me. This 
city is better than West 
Lafayette." 

He feels thai as a univer- 
sity town. West Lafayette 
is too small. 

The winters here have been hard for 
Fan and his family. He emphasized 
several times, "everything is so 
different." 

Anne-Thcrese Delplanque. from 
France, is a fourth year student at 




United States, so she works very hard 
to make mostly 'A' grades. 

"That is my reward for my 
Dad...ihal is the only way I can pay 
back my Dad," Delplanque said. 

Delplanque works on campus 20 
hour; per week as an administrative 
assistant for Student Government, a 
French tab assistant, and she tutors 
French. She works as much as she 
can on her student F-1 visa to help 
pay for her education. 
"I wish I could do more!" she said. 
Delplanque admits thai at first, she 
felt rather isolated, except in her Eng- 
lish classes, where all of liie foreign 
students had the same problem — that 
of learning the language. The first 
two years she did not really feel that 
the other students were very interest- 
ed in her, and believes that her accent 
was a barrier. 

Her English classes have helped her 
a lot, and she has noticed a real dif- 
ference this year, Delplanque senses 
that students are more interested in 
her, and that people talk to her more 
now. 

She still experiences 
some trouble in under- 
standing some classes, 
such as political science, 
but the teachers are helpful 
when they find out that she 
is French, Now she makes 
it a point to let her teach- 
ers know that she is an in- 
ternational student from 
France. 
Delplanque's goal is to leach French 
at the college level. After 
her B,A. in French, she plans to work 
on a M.A. in French at LU, Bloom- 
in gion. 

PulLn Sampat is an iniemauonal stu- 
dent from North India who was raised 



Sampat gave several reasons, Purdue 
University has an excellent reputation 
in India. He also has relatives in Fon 
Wayne, where he lives. The third rea- 
son he cited for choosing IPFW over 
West Lafayette, was the expense. 
School is much more expensive at 
West Lafayette. 

His goal is to earn a Ph J), in Neuro 
science. Sampat calls it, "brain re- 
search, basically." 

He hopes to gain some work experi- 
ence before he returns home to India, 
Currently. Sampat works as a re- 
search assistant in Physics, and as a 
leaching assistant in Computer Sci- 
ence. Like Delplanque. he too. is paid 
for 20 hours of work per 
week. Also, he has been on 
the University Honors List 
every semester, except one. 

Of his experiences on 
campus, Sampat says "Ab- 
solutely great!" 

Both the professors and 

the students have been very 
ampal friendly, and he has fell 
very welcome here. He 
makes an effort to have mosdy non- 
Indian friends and has succeeded ad- 
mirably, 

"I try K 

plained. 

He finds thai many students and 

professors have been fascinated by 
his cultural differences. 

Sampat listed some of the changes 
he would like to see: he would not 
mind getting paid more; he would 
like to see residential housing on 
campus; he does not believe the li- 
brary has enough books and maga- 
zines for research purposes; and he 
would like to see the buildings open 
later than 11 pjn. He knows this is a 
source of hardship for many students, 

Sampat feels that as a smaller cam- 
pus. iPFW offers undergraduates 
tremendous opponunities at jobs, re- 
search, etc. Being a teaching or re- 
search assistant as an undergraduate 
would be almost impossible at a big- 
ger school like West Lafayette, He 
believes that more students should 
take advantage of these tremendous 
opportunities at IPFW.

Play shows horrors, injustices 



By Ngoil Rogers 
SlafT Writer 

NeffReciiaJHall. 

I'm four rows from the stage in 
darkness waiting for the pliy to be- 
gin. The cries from the baby across 
the aisle, the smell of the man's feet 
behind mc and the stiff, doctor's 
waiting room style, fabric of the 
chair all cease to bother me when the

forms of three figures apjjcar from 
behind the curtain. These figures, 
dressed in black, cross over to three 
black chairs at center stage. 1 squint 
to try arxl make out their faces wail- 
ing for the lights to come up. 

'Our Young Black Men Arc Dying 
and Nobody Seems to Care' by 
James Chapman. 

The title of the play and one of the 
main messages expressed by it is 
shown through a series of vignettes 
drown from the lives and experiences 
of black men. 

During the two hour original musi- 
cal play, many stories were depicted 
and I wish I could describe them all.,, 
-Teacher, why didn't you tell 
me about my people in 
history? 
-Teacher, why didn't you tell 
me they were brave 
and strong? 
-Teacher, you lied. 
This excerpt is from a vignette that 
describes children in school asking 
their teacher why they were lied to 
about dicir people's contribution in 



hisior&gt;'. Later, ihcy tell the teacher 
that they know their people, oui peo- 
ple, my people did contribute and 
should be acknowledged and praised. 

Big O' Drugs. 

This story addresses the origin or 
owner of drugs in America, A man 
finds a bag of drugs and attempts to 
locate the owner. His inquiry takes 
him through the chain frcro junkie to 
dealer to maker to CIA to president 
and congress to finally the old gray 
haired Caucasian man in the big 
chair by the window where all the 
world can be seen. When asked if the 
bag of drugs belongs to him, the old 
gray haired Caucasian man answered 
"Yes. Why thank yoiL" The man who 
asked was arrested for possession. 

The last piece presented told of the 
injustices of the past and present of 
black men; being hung, breed, im- 
prisoned, and having to fight in un- 
just wars. The audience was not left 
with those emotions. We were left 
with 'I don't care what you do tome, 
I won't let it take away the essence 
of me, I'm more than what you sec." 

As I listened lo these and other sto- 
ries characterizing crack addiction, 
police brutality, AIDS, and alco- 
holism, I heard and felt the emotions 
of depression, dehumanization, sup- 
pressed anger and self hatred. Pride, 
self respect, and self love were also 
fell. With these I can relate if not 
from my own experiences, from the 
black men in my family, my frictxJs 
and people of color in other 
counoics. 

Fortunately. I wasn't the only one. 
There is hope. 



Much of the full houfc were young 
black nulc high school siudents. 

During the question and answer pe- 
riod after the play, one student, Dar- 
nell Bennett from Wayne High 
School, only had one cctnmcni, "I've 
rwvcr seen stuff like this; man, this is 

Of thai comment, actor Lawrence 

Kirkland remarked while rwdding his 
head toward the audience. "I know 
we reached one person." 

To the three actors, all from New 
York, reaching people is an important 
goal. Dylan Brown expressed "We 
(acioTsj want Ihc audience to go 
homo feeling like leoders; people 
who have something to give. Wo 
I African -Americans I are not stupid. 
We've contributed a lot and its lime 
to get cure." 

Self respect was strongly empha- 
sized by all three actors as a partial 
'solution', "self love and respect. 
You can't respect others if you can'i 
respect youiselT', said actor Derek 
Johnson. 

The main advice Dylan Brown had 
was, "h starts here. They (the audi, 
ence) are here. They see themselves 
in the play. They should take whi 
they got and run with it (bccaiLSc] it 
up to us to keep ourselves alive." 

'Our Youn^ Black Men Are Dying 
and Nobody Soem.s lo Care' waa pre- 
sented in conjunction with the OfTico 
of Multicultural Services program 
Workshop on Violence February 23, 
1993, The play was co-sponsored by 
the Fort Wayne Urban Lcoguc and 
African-American Teens On the 
Move (A.TO.M.).

Foul cap adds to game 



Ry Michael Ba^f 
Sports Ediior 

THE PROBLEM 

fia^kciball is one of Ihe mosl veil- 
ing sporu I have ever witnessed and 
pUyed. Ai ill levels o( play the speed 
and caliber of the players helps to 
make it Ihc (asiest paced game ever 
witnessed. 

Al Die college level, two 20-fninuie 
halves can whirl by in a quick blur of 
speed, agility, jmd teamwork. 

The game is won by skill, talent, and 
through coaching ability. 

As thiny eight minutes whiz by you 
have to say this is ihc greatest sporl of 
all time. 

THEN IT HITS YOU, Like an Im- 
movable boulder the game time stands 
still. Flics will have been bom, mated, 
and died by the time this game will be 

THE DREADED TWO MINUTE 
HOUR is at hand. The greatest game 
in the imivcrsc has been shot down by 
this evil incantation of bitter death. 

What is the two minute hour you 
ask? If you have ever watched a cou- 
ple of basketball games you will have 
seen the two minute hour. 

Usually a team will be down by sev- 
en or eight points with two minutes 
]eft in the game and decide their only 



chance at survival is by fouling their 
opponents into oblivion. 

They painstakingly stop the clock 
after every one of their possesions by 
fouling the opponent in hopes to bring 
the game closer by missed foul shots. 

Two questions have to be asked; (I) 
Does it work and if so (2) can you re- 
ally say the bciict team won? 

I have never actually seen a team 
win using the two minute hour. I saw 



The ball's 
in my court 



it come clo.sc in the last Michigan- In- 
diana game when Michigan brought 
the game within one before it ended. 

If it did work docs it mean the best 
team won? NO. the best team won 
when the losing opponent decided the 
two minute hour offcnsc/dcfcnsc was 
their only chance of survival. 

THE TWO MINUTE HOUR is like 
six last minute three point shots from 
half court in a row. It ju.si doesn't hap- 
pen and shouldn't. 

What can be done about it? 
THE SOLUTION 

The solution lies in what I coll the 
THREE MINUTE FOUL CAR With 
three minutes left in the game a new 



rule should be insiallcd. 

A foul cap where each team is al- 
lowed to foul only five/sji times in 
the last three minutes. Regular rules 
apply until the foul cap hils. then the 
fouled team shoots two free throws 
and gels the ball back on the side of 
IhccourL 

The cap would have to allow for a 
number of fouls that are regularly 
called during close games, to keep 
fouling a pan of a coach's game plan, 
but it would minimize the intentional 
fouls a team makes just to stay in the 
game a couple of minutes longer. 

THE THREE MINUTE FOUL CAP 
would benefit in two ways. (1) it 
would speed up the game because it 
would limit intentional fouls and (2) 
it would still allow for some as- 
pccLsof the TWO MINUTE HOUR 
offensc^Dcfense, 

One of the great aspects of basket- 
ball is Ihc speed and pace the game 
takes. The foul cap would insure the 
flow and continuity of the game and 
not lock it up in a battle at the free 
throw line. 

The grcatcsl game in Ihe universe 
would still be the greatest game in Ihe 
universe, and wouldn't be dogged by 
that inescapable last two minutes from 
hell. 



Mastodons hold back Puma surge 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

Two weeks ago Saint Joseph upset 
both Kentucky Wcslcyan and South- 
ern Indiana to tighten the conference 
race in the CLVC. 

On Ttiursday Feb. 25 Saint Joseph 
hoped to knock the IPFW Mastodons 
down also. The Mastodons, however, 
lei Ihe Pumas know just how good of 
icam they arc by beating Ihcm 74-^. 

Two nights later the Mastodons 
hosted Lewis in the last home game 
of the regular season. After a close 
first half IPFW pulltyj away to win 
89-76. 

Againsi St. Joseph the Mastodons 
goi down to business early taking the 
lead oET a basket and the foul by Se- 
nior Shane Gibson with 1 1 minutes to 
play in the fir^t half. 

The Mastodons buill up the lead on 
a nine point run thai ended with a 
three by Senior Sean Gibson. The 
Pumas crawled back into the game 
and lied with one minute 12 sccotids 
left in the half, but the Mastodons hit 



their last two shots to take the lead at 
half 39-35. 

The second half was led by Shane 
Gibson who had 20 points on the 
night. 1 1 of them in the second h^f. 

'The Mastodons built the lead up to 
II points with three minutes 57 sec- 
onds left. 

With two minutes left in ihc game 
the Pumas began fouling in hopes to 
crawl back into the game. The 
Mastodons hit only 6 of 13 free 
throws and the Pumas pulled wiihin 
three. 

With the score at 70-66 Sean Gib- 
son went 10 the line and convened 
both attempts with 24 seconds left to 
re-establish a six point lead. 

The Pumas last chance was foiled 
after a steal and break away layup by 
senior Andre Walton. 

Shane Gibson led the team scoring 
with 20 points. Shane Gibson was al- 
so honored as player of itic week in 
the GLVC.
