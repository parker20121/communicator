Harris: High-tech

By MIKE Rl 
Managing Editor 
America has a love affair with high 
technology Many people see the 

menl of scientific equipment as the 
miracle that will turn the economy 
around and bring prosperity to 
America. 

Anthropologist Marvin Harris doesn't 
see high lechnology as the answer (o 
America's problems, but rather adding

University, spoke to a standing room

Harris used the Ford Escort as an

mum pointed at federal agencies 
such as the Internal Revenue Service as 
ways the federal government has in-

By the use of high lech, multinational 
corporations now have what Harris 
called "hyper-mobilily of capital." 
With this mobility of capital, the cor- 
poration is able to move lis operations 
from the United States to a place where 
labor Is cheap. He cited the current 
dilemma with smoke-stack and sunset 
industries and the movement ot 
companies to third world nations as 
examples "What's lo slop them Irom 
doing that with high lech? " he asked. 

He also said jobs which traditionally 
have drawn women, secretarial and 
other service jobs arc those most 
threatened by high tech. "They want to

Faculty, students state opinions on controversial honors program 



By AMY /l I Hi II Ml 
Staff Writer 

The honors program was designed lo 
an enriching experience that brings 
together intellectually gifted students 
sharing a grealer-than-average In- 
terest in a particular subject Lalely, 
however, it has been the center of 
controversy. 

Although designed ior this purpose, 
one of Ihe most important requirements 
is for sludenls to showan interest In Ihe 
program, said Sylvia Neely. asslstanl 
professor of history and director of the 
honors program. 

"We offer lhc opport unifies and want 
lo make exceptions." Neely said. "The 
purpose of the program Is (o offer 
classes to meet these students' needs 
and to challenge Ihem 

Opposition to the honors program has 
come from Ihe sociology and an- 
thropology deparlmenL "We agree Ihis 
program is elitist." said Alan R. 
Sandstrom, associate professor of 
anthropology. 

"There is enough Inequality outside 
of schools without promoting it within 
schools," said Peter ladicola, chair- 
person of the sociology-anthropology 
department. "Enough la enough." 

This and other criticisms have come 
about since the spring of 1982 when Ihe 
sociology and anthropology department 
faculty decided not to participate in the 
honors program. 

Staff and money can be belter served 
lo meet the needs of students who need 
help while In college, ladicola said. 
"The honors program Is a waste of 

Another concern of Ihe sociology 






the i 



nagement of 

misallocalion of teachers," ladicola 
said. "The best teachers are used to 
leach honors classes when they are 
needed lo help students who are not so 
academically advantaged due lo a 
poorer financial background." 

A third criticism the sociology faculty 
conveyed is that the whole program Is 
unnecessary "Separate studies are 
already offered to Lheadvanced student 
In Ihe form of 495 classes." ladicola 



The la si argument offered against the 
honors program concerns tillering 
brighter sludenls out of the regular 
classroom. "Bright students are a

The sociology faculty members said 
the best professors would be used to 
teach the honors classes. "We have 
never claimed Lhc besl teachers would 
be used for this program," Neely said. 
"I have one problem with the train of 
I ho ugh t lhal rich people arc 
academically talented- People from all 
backgrounds can be fine sludenls

In response to criticisms the program 
Is not needed, Neely said, "The 
program is not in conflict with the 495 
classes. The honors courses aim to be 



an Deceleration ol supplementary in- 
formation in other areas." 

Neely said she doesn't think bright 
students would be filtered out of the 



In the fall of 1980, according to Ihe 
Faculty Senate Document, seven 
percent of the IPFW undergraduates 
wereadmilled inlo Ihe program wilh an 
SAT score above 600 (verbal 165 
students; math 549 studentsl or were 
ranked within Ihe top ten percent of 
Iheir high school graduating class. 

Approximately 450 IPFW un- 
dergraduates completing at least 
twelve credit hours established a GPA 
of j.SlfUl or 5.5 (PU1 In 1979. 

Neely said there has not been a 
faculty senate meeling concerning the 
honors program since Ihe objections 
were presented by the sociology- 
anthropology depor tm en I . 

In comparison to LPFW, lU-South 
Bend has had an honors program since 
1975 "There have been nn complainls 
from Ihe different departments," said 
Pat Duffy, honor's secretary at IUSB. 
"Our biggest problem is not enough 
sludenls arc interested." 

niSB has a currenl enrollment of 40 
honor's students with an annual budget 
of approximately 19.000. 

Olher faculty' members besides those 
i r.-.-rn :■■!-.■ i ■■]i:,,;i .■!,' tin. ■;-&gt;■■ !",v. .;!.■■- oi 
fercd comments. "I think it Is an ex- 
periment thai ought to be attempted 
and can then be evaluated In terms of 
the objections raised by Ihe Sociology 
Department," said Mark P. Sheldon, 
associate pro lessor of philosophy. 



The program has many good 
qualifies but should not include fresh- 
man sludenls because SAT scores are 
unreliable, said Steven Hollander, 
assistant professor of English and 
university editor. 

The transitional studies program, 
which helps academically disad- 
vantaged students, is not considered 
elitist by the sociology-anthropology 
department because it tries lo help 
students raise their academic level lo 
create a more equal academic society. 

Valli Pherson, skills specialist far the 
transitional studies program, said 
approximately 500 students are In the 
program Ihis year The budget for the 
Transitional Studies Program Is about 
130,000, Dirkes said. 

The direct cost of the honors program 
this year was about ts.000, Neely said. 
The honors class offered this semester 
has 16 students. An enrollment of 55 
sludenls In three different honors 
classes Is projected far the fall 

Allhough the costs and number of 
students were not confirmed by 
Edward A. Nicholson, vice-chancellor 
and dean of Ihe faculty, he did confirm 
Ihere is more money put into the 
transitional studies program than the 
honors program. 

Students are admitted to the tran- 
sitional studies program according to 
scores on exams in math and English, 
Pherson said. 

Qualifications Tor freshmen lo get 
into the honors program include gel ting 
permission from the instructor, scoring 
600 on the math or verbal SAT or being 
ranked in (he lop ten percent of Iheir 



h school graduating class. Dir

IPFW sludenls also commented on 
Ihehonorsprogram. 

"The altitude of the sociology 
department is childish," said Jay 
Wolfe, student senator. "Just dropping 
out doesn't help anything. " 

Wolfe added that affirmative action 
needs to be taken. 

The honors program should be open 
lo any student, said Ken Schenk. 
sludent body president. 

Other changes should include student 
input on who will be In the program. 
Schenk said. "We want two sludenls 
serving on Ihe honors council, "he said. 

"We want (o moke sure students who 
wanl to take part in Ihe honors program 
can get in," said Don Gorney. studenl 
senator. 

The purpose of sludent Input In Ihe 
honors program is to benefit students 
by prolecling Iheir interests. "The 
problems within Ihe program are 
handled by the honors council. We 
believe student representatives should 
represent both (he student body and the 
honors program by having a 

"I would hope the (wo student 
representatives wouldn't be non-

"This program Is not cast in con-

benefit."

Extra two days 
a good idea 



Msumi 



If you're feeling a little run down, It's 
probably because you haven't had a 
vacation in ten weeks. We hate lo be the 
bearer of bad tidings, but spring break 
won't be here for two more weeks. In two 
years, however, students won't have lo 
wail 12 weeks before heading for 
Daytona Beach. The Faculty Senate 
recently passed the I9M-85 academic 
calendar, which includes a two-day 
break six weeks into the spring semester 
and spring break six weeks later. 

The Faculty Senate should be com- 
mended for the fallowing: 

1) Taking the students' mentaJ health 
into consideration by scheduling a two- 
day break in February. 

2) Keeping spring break where it is. 
Even though Purdue- West Lafayette 
students had their spring break last 
week and Ill-Bloom ington students are 



having theirs, IPFW students have it 
belter. Although Indiana's weather is 
unpredictable, IPFW's spring break ts 
when the weather is likely to be warmer. 
Even without a two-day break, 12 weeks 
is still worth the wait. 

There is one flaw in the schedule, 
though. Weekend college students are 
required to attend classes on Saturday 
and Sunday when others get the two-day 
break. They need the break just as 
much. 

So if you're ready to head for Florida 
but have a political science test lo study 
for instead, remember the wait won't be 
as long in '35. Students will get a two-day 
break in February and still have a week 
off during warmer weather. If you won't 
be here in '85, you can hope the weather 
will make this semester' 
truly spring break.

STUDENT AID. 

It takes more than brains to go 
to college. It takes money. For tuition, 
room and board, and books. 

The Army College Fund is 
designed to help you get that money 
for college while serving your country. 

If you qualify, you can join the 
Army College Fund when you join the 
Army. For every dollar you put in, 
Uncle Sam puts in five. Or more. 

So, after just two years in the 
Army, you can have up to $15,200 for 
college. After three years, up to $20, 100. 

To get your free copy of the 
Army College Fund booklet, call or visit 
your local Army Recruiter. It could be the most important book you've 
ever read.
