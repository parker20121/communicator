Transfer students 
receive credit 

IPFW will now allow C 
minus grades received ai oihcr 
institulions lo count for crcdil. 
Historically, transfer students 
had lo make up such a course on 
this campus. 

'The question on whether or 
not to allow C minuses to couni 
had not been considered before," 
said Jack Dahl. According lo 
Dahl, both lU-Dloomington and 
Purdue- West Ufayclle a&lt;xept C 
minus grades from transfers. 
Dahl said he saw no reason why 
IPFW could not do Ihc same. 

The decision was made by the 
Educational Policy Committee 
of ihc Faculty Senate. Steve 
Sarraiorc headed the committee 
of Barbara Dulmahn, Jcanctte 
Clausen. Steven Hollander, Ftcd

Former surgeon general prescribes remedies for U.S. 



By ML'gan McArdlc 
Managing Bditor 

Joycclyn Elders, former surgeon general, 
prescribed a cure for the ills of America to 
more than 300 people during her speech 
Tuesday in die Walb Memorial Ballroom. 

Most of the cures she outlined involved 
preventive medicine. 

Elders said we need 10 (each the people, 
and specifically the children, of America 
about iheir own health. 

"We have a health illiterate society," she 
said. 

According 10 Elders, children spend more 
than 15,000 hours in Iheir lifetimes in front of 
television, and get less ihan SO hours of health 
education. 

Elders said, "We need health facilities at 
Lhc schools 10 address the problems." 

She also said ihe best kind of medicine is 
preventive medicine. 

According to Elders, "sick care" accounts 
for 99 percent of the loial monies spenl on 



"health care". 

Another kind of prevention Elders men- 
tioned was Head Start. She said thai for every 
dollar spent on Head Start, four dollars are 
saved. 

The main problem Elders said she had with 
the way Americans spend money is their lack 
of willingness to provide for iheir children. 

She said Americans have the money to 
spend on everything else, but they "don't have 
the money to invest in children." 

Kevin Eads, IPSGA president-elect, said 
he agreed wiih Elders. "We need to have a 
commitment 10 our children," he said. 

According to Elders. America's children 
have "shoes that light up when ihey walk, and 
brains that go dead when they talk." 

Elders said Americans could alleviate this 
problem with planing. "We need to make sure 
that every child born in America is a planned 
and wanted child." 

In addition to planning. Elders said 
Americans need to take responsibility. 

"We've got to Slop letting our young men 



walk around and donate sperm and think that 
that is responsibility." 

Elders said she did not hold anything 
against President Clinton for dismissing her. 
"I feel that the president 
did what he had to do in 
the political climate that 
we live in. 

"I went 10 
Washington lo do a Job. 
... I tried to wake up 
Americans. 

"As surgeon general 
all you have is the bully 
pulpit 10 get things 
done," she said. 

She also said that she 
did not think she was treated unfairly by the 
press. "If it wasn't for the press coverage, I 
wouldn't be here today because no one would 
know who I was," she said. 

Those who attended the speech definitely 
wanted her to be here and showed il with two 
standing ovations.

Elders 



Rakki Goldstein of the Fort Wayne 
Women's Bureau said she dilnks it is Impor- 
tant to bring speakers like Elders 10 campus, 
"It bridges die gap between campus and com- 
miiniiy," she said. 

Virginia Blackburn, also of the Fort 
Wayne Women's Bureau, said she agreed 
with many of the things Elders said. "She was 
able to articulate a strategy ... She held out 
hope." 

At least one person at IPFW didn't think 
Elders' message was too hopeful. 

Greg Bracho. a student at IPFW said, "She 
dealt in a superficial way without going into 
detailed reasons." 

Anti-abortion protesters expressed iheir 
opinions before and after Elders' speech with 
signs saying "Abortion kills children," 

The speech was the Tirsi in a scries spon- 
sored by IPSGA and SAD, William F. 
Buckley, Ihe second speaker in the scries, will 
speak tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the Walb 
Memorial Ballroom. Tickets arc available at 
the Sweet Shoppc and at the door.

IPSGA President reflects 
on his tenure 



By MvlUsa Young-Flores 
Chief Reporter 



Soon the class of '95 will put on their caps 
and gowns 10 commence dieir undergraduate college 
careers. And widi them will leave a year of memories, 
^nmc to always cherish and oth- 
ers they wish they and (heir 
classmates could forget. 

And just as the under- 
graduate era for the seniors will 
end, the IPSGA presidency for 
Mark King will also come to an 
end complete with some good 
and some unwanted memories. 

The memories of the 
first few weeks of the fall semes- 
ter can be recollected as rocky 
ones for the exiting senior. 

At the beginning of the Fall semester. King 
decided to remove the Campus Calendar from the 
Communicator, and King's kitchen began to heat up. 

King said he had decided to pull the calendar 
at the beginning of his pr;sidency but wailed until the 
fall in order not to financially hurt the 
Communicator's summer issues. 

King defends his reasoning for pulling the 
Campus Calendar, but said his handling of the situa- 
tion was one of his failures as IPSGA president 

King staled that he would use the funds to 
insiall a 1 -800 voicemail system which he fell was a

betier way of informing students. 

According to King, the system has still not 
been enacted as he would have liked, but stated the 
two computer chips on campus needed to activate the 
system were already taken by other departments. 

"The library is now on-line. They got one of 
the cards," King said. 'So what we arc going to try to 
do is work widi the library." 

King said he regrets die system was not acti- 
vated during his administration, but hopes that it will 
be made available to students during Kevin Eads' 
administration. 

Il was not long after the fire of Campus 
Calendar fizzled that King faced another incideni diat 
would stay in the scrapbook of unforgettable events. 

Flames soon sparked over King's request for 
the Communicator lo review an advertisement that 
referred to abortion. 

"1 never tried to pull the abortion ad from die 
newspaper, I wrote a letter asking them to review iC 
said King, "I received a complaint from a student who 
thought student government ran the newspaper. I 
reacted on the student's complaint" 

The flames did noi die for King as die year 
progressed, and the idea of a Technology Fee exploded 
on campus. Tensions flared as SAB member Kerry

Chief Reporter 



The mitsi commonly used finan- 
cial aid used on campus, the Stafford 
loan, would still be available, bul at 
higher interest rates. According lo 
Casazza, students would feel a 20 to 
30 percent interest rate increase. 

The 
Harvard rcpori 
estimated that stu- 
dents' monthly 
paymcnls would 
increase approxi- 
mately 19.4 per-

increase for gradu-

be even higher,

But m order for the system to

aware of how Ihe system works, 

"For sludenls to banefh. thay

Thay need lo read it carefully." 
Zollers said. 

Zellars said that sludenls 
should carefully read ihe back

PEPPERIDGE FARM 
GENEVA COOKIES 

Well, this cookie is really 
iniercsting. For $2.29. you get 
tons of great taste. The cookie 
itself is a wafer with one side 
dipped in a dark, luscious 
chocolate layered with pecans. 
The wafer part is really dry. but 
the sweet chocolate makes up 
for it. But for three cookies you 
consume nine grams of fat and 
160 calories. This cookie 
receives two biles out of a pos- 
sible four. 



PEPPERIDGE FARM 

MINT BRUSSELS 

COOKIES 

This cookie was pretty good 
as far as cookies go. The cookie 
itself was a sandwichlike cookie 
with chocolate and white creme 
stuff in the middle of two thin 
wafers. The mint taste was dis- 
tinct, but it was 
nol like real 
minty. if that 
®h*l '^ ^ word. 
After eating 
only three 
cookies you also take in 10 
grams of fat and 190 calories. 
And the cost: $2.29, My final 
rating for this cookie: three bites 
out of a possible four. 

PEPPERIDGE FARM 
BORDEAUX COOKIES 

WOW! For a plain, thin 
wafer, this cookie really packs in 
the taste. The crunch that this 
cookie has really makes the

cookie even better, I 
love this cookie. I just {f.-i\^ 
can nol get over how V •J . 
good this plain little 
thing really is. Bui the 
downside is of course, those 
damn five grams of fat and 130 
calories for only eating four of 
these delicious cookies. And 
who are we kidding, you know 
you will eat more than just four. 
And the cost: S2.29. For a final 
rating 1 give this cookie four 
bites out of a possible four.

you can taste that they are some- 
what buttery. They are light and 
fluffy in tei^ture. but the taste is 
rich and very satisfying. For a 
serving of three cookies you 
take in only five grams of fat 
and 120 calories. And for S2.29, 
you too can enjoy these nol-so - 
heaitliy snacks. My final rating 
for this cookie is three biles out 
of a possible four. 

PEPPERIDGE FARM 
LIDO COOKIES 

This particular cookie is a 
sandwich cookie. The pretty cir- 
cular sandwich has a rather thin 
layer of nch, sweet, dark choco- 
late in between a thick, flaky 
wafer. This cookie is kind of 
plain, but who really cares at 
this point? If you like chocolate 
and buttery wafers, try this 
cookie-you will like it. And for 
$2.29. you can not go wrong. 
But one can not forget those 4 
1/2 grams of fat and 90 calories 
for just ONE cookie. Hello 



Jenny Craig. My final rating for 
this cookie: three bites out of 

four, 

PEPPERIDGE FARM 
MILANO COOKIES 

Lai,i. bul ccnainly nol least, 
is a cookie that lastes almost 
exacUy like the Lido 
cookie. The only 
real difference I 
ibund was the obvi- 
ous design and the 
fat/calorie count. 
For a total of three 
cookies you con- 
sume not only good 
flavor and rich chocolate, 
but also 10 grams of fat and 180 
calories. The diet Is definitely 
over. And besides what Is anoth- 
er S2.29 anyway?!#@* My final 
rating for the Milano cookie is 
three bites out of a possible four.

Joan Osborne's debut CD 'Relish' 




ByNotT.Beckky 
News Editor 

UnTonunalcly every CD [ 
review is noi grcai and Joan 
Osborne's first major label release, 
"Relish," is a prime example. I 
warned lo like (his but I did nol feci 
ihis CD in my heart or soul. 

Osborne bas a liitle promise, bui 
as a while female "blues" singer 
she falls inio ihc "I warn lo sound 
like Bonnie Rain" syndrome with 
overused guit^ riffs and undefined 
vocals. If Osbome could find ber 
own voice she may become a 
decern singer. All loo often 
Osborne attempts to sound like 
every oUicr successful female voice 
in the business. Although the lyrics 
arc sometimes poignant, they seem 
forced and void of blood and sinew. 

"Great lyrics are beautiful and 
amazing to have, and something 1 
work very bard at, but it's the 
vocals thai reach places where your 
mind doesn't go," Osbome said. 



Her vocals took me no where I 
have not gone before. Bonnie Railt 
already took me there 10 years ago, 
long before Raitt was successful. 

Not only does Osborne take a 
trip down Bonnie Railt Lane but 
she also attempts walk down Shcryl 
Crow Avenue. Even when Shcryl 
Crow is at her best, she sucks raw 
sewage. The music industry needs 
another Shcryl Crow like OJ. 
needs another ex-wife. 

In a New York Times article, 
John Pareles called "Relish" "one 
of the strongest major label debut 
albums of 1995." Either this was 
the only major label debut Pareles 
reviewed or be listened to While 
Zombie's new CD. 

The only redeeming segment of 
Ihis CD is the first track. "St, 
Teresa." If the resi of the CD had a 
similar feel of this track it would 
have been a respectable release. 
Despite her press clippings, 1 feel 
"Relish" was almost a good idea 
which failed.

Tori WMfnc Is hi4mif%s* tiot P^iis 



By Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

It's not Miss America or Miss 
Universe, no. it's Miss Gay 
Indiana. Never before in my life 
bad I been exposed to something so 
flamboyant and different. Yes folks, 
my eyes were opened wide to the 
world of drag queens in Indiana. 

Now, you are probably wonder- 
ing how did I end up at a gay beau- 
ty pageant. Well, its kind of like 
this, I just wanted to go to the 
movies, but I Icl my friend peer- 
pressure mc into broadening my 
i horizons, opening my conservative 
eyes. And believe me.' boy, were 
they ever broadened. 1 mean 
"Victor/Victoria" was a movie, but 
this was reality. As my companion 
said 10 me that night, "No, honey, 
Paris is not burning, but Fort 



Wayne is." 

Getting lo the actual event was a 
hassle, especially since the coordi- 
nators picked a somewhat hidden 
location unknown to not only 
myself but also to my traveling 
companion. Needle.^ to say, he was 
running low on gas and I was get- 
ling anxious. So, I, being Ihe smart 
one, called and got directions on 
my cellular phone. 

When we finally arrived at Ihe 
Speedway Bingo Hall, I found a 
whole new world. And I'm asking 
myself where in the hell is 
Aladdin? 

He definitely wasn't ai the Miss 
Gay Indiana Pageant. ■ 

So, we walk into this bingo hall 
and I'm surrounded by, you bctcha. 
gay men. And some were gor- 
geous, like Magnum P.I. gorgeous. 
Well, then you have the contestants 



who performed to such musical 
artists like Ella Fitzgerald, Patsy 
Cline and Bonnie Tyler, 

Now, of course 1 had to pause 
for a moment and absorb the situa- 
tion. I mean, my companion was 
enjoying himself. Not that I wasn't, 
but I had never in my life seen men 
dressed in beautiful costumes as 
women, performing as women (and 
very convincingly too. I mean my

ricks of the week 



BOOK OF THE WEEK: "Gooe 
With the Wind" by Margeret 
Mitchell. This long book tells the 
lEtle of a Souihern belle, Scarlett 
O'Hu^ Most everyone has probably 
seen the movie starring Clark Gable 
and Vivian L«igh, but if you read the 



t&gt;ook you might find some interest- 
ing differences. 

MOVIE OF THE WEEK: "Forrcsi 
Gump" starring Tom Hanks and 
Silly Fields. Although this movie 
has been oul for quite sometime, you 
should go see it if you haven't 
already. And if you have seen it, go 
see it again; it's only S 1 now. 



MOVIE TO RENT OF THE 
WEEK: "Schindler's Lisl." Enough 
saiJ. 

CD OF THE WEEK: "Prince; The 
Hits and B-SIUes." This three-disc 
sei has all of the great Prince hils 
you aln;ady know and love. And this 
CD set is wonh every penny, and 
believe me, you fork out a lot of pen- 



drag queens arc extremely talentcxl 
men who take a chance by going 
against the status quo and giving 
the audience a part of themselves 
that no one has ever seen. If you 
have never seen a drag show, and 
according to my companion this 
one was not as provocative as some 
can be, 1 suggest you should go 
down to After Dark on a Thursday 
night and witness such an interest- 
ing and culturally diverse form of 
entenainmeni.

Internet bill unnecessary 



[n an allcmpi lo keep pornogra-

Scnaion James F,j.ot\, D-Ncb., and 
Sladc Gonon R-Wash.. have inuo- 
duced an amcndmcnl (o (be 
Telecommunications Dill Ibai 
toughens penalties for those who 
transmit pornographic and harass- 
ing material, 

Exon's bill would also make it 
illegal for consenting adulu to send 
private messages that could be 
found "lewd" or "filihy." 

IVescnt laws proiccl people from 
bamssmcnl and punish purveyors of 
obscenity and child pornography. 
No new bill is needed. Ifanylegis- 
btion at all is necessary it is a clear- 
er dcriniiion of what is not accept- 
able, and not sweeping legislation 
which affects personal solicited 
messages. 

This bill may even violate a per- 
son's First Amendment right to free 
speech. If that is the case then 
Senator Exon would be better to 
scrap the whole idea than to risk 
lawsuits that would cost the govern- 
ment thousands of dollars lo 
defend. 

What the Senator also fails to 
acknowledge is the relative difficul- 
ty in obiaining this material. Yes, il 
is out there, but il is not as readily 
available as playboy magazines, 
which can be purchased at many 
convenience stores. Children arc 
probably ten limes more likely to 



sec print pornography than they are 
to find it on the Internet. It is not as 
if they arc jusi going to stumble 
aaos^ it. ihey are going to have to 
go looking for il, and they have to 
look pretty hard. 

Often the way items on the 
Internet are found is through soft- 
ware programs which search for 
specific subjects. As Jerry Berman 
and Daniel Weitzer mentioned in 
the column they wrote for the 
Scripps Howard News Service, par- 
ents can u.sc these programs to pro- 
hibit children from doing these 
kinds of searches. 

In addition some on-line services 
arc clearting up the Internet for their 
clients, allowing them to chose 
what they do and don't have access 
to. Parents can also limit children's 
access dirough this medium. 

Even with these limits, some 
children will find pornography on 
the Intemel. Yet these are the same 
children that wouldn't be afraid to 
ask a stranger to go into an adult 
book store and buy them a dirty 
magazine. As always, those that 
really want to get it will find a way, 
and those thai want to transmit it 
will find a way too. 

There is no reason to make 
pornography easy to get or disirib- 
uic, but those that are selling limits 
and making laws need to make sure 
they are respecting the rights of 
individual citizens also.

Play review unfair to actress 



The firsi time I read The 
Communicator was on April 20, 
before a matinee performance in the 
William's Theater. Accordingly, 
the article I experienced that after- 
noon was the review of "Romeo 
and Juliet." The article certainly 
was an attention getter, in fact, it 
encouraged me lo read on to see 
whether other topics or individual 
students were treated as insensitive- 
ly as Ihe acuuss playing Juliet was 
treated in the review by the features 
editor. 1 must report that I was 
relieved to see that at least "Ben 
and Jerry's" ice cream was judged 
with full respect. 

The review of "Romeo and 
Juliel" was written largely on the 
basis of the feature editor's opinion 
of Juliet's delivery of the famous, 
"Romeo, Romeo ... " line. Many 
people, and most actresses realize 
that criticism is a part of life and 
definitely a pan of life in theater. In 
reviewing a play such as Romeo 
and Juliet one might try to report on

What exactly is lT\ith when it comes 
to acting? Acting is considered art. 
An is communication, Mid commu- 
nication often offers a variable 
result Why is the truth about an so 
difficult to define? The lines of 
communication cross easily and 
everyone inicrprcis things differcni- 
ly. 'fhat must be kepi in mind when 
criiici.sm is rendered. TTie rights and 
wrongs of a performance are dan- 
gerous territory for the critic. If crit- 
icism is to be offered then it should 
be done so very carefully and defi- 
nitely should be presented purely as 
opinion, without accusation and 
without guise of unnecessary, con- 
descending humor. 1 fully respect 
Miss Whiting's opinion, yet 1 
believe that the expression of her 
views could be just as effectively 
conveyed in a less personal and 
more constructive manner. 

Sincerely,

I've been a student of sons for 
five years now. pressing ray liltle 
levers for food pelleis and increas- 
ingly frequent shocks. When I was 
3 kid, I used to think ihe lU symbol 
was some sort of Greek letter or 
pagan holy symbol: but then I 
didn't get much oxygen when I was 
growing up. When 1 first enrolled 
in college, 1 shared the dream of 
many liberal 
arts students;

I've matured a 
lot since then, 
and I now real- 
ize that I can 
make much bet- 
ter money driving the big rigs. 

Perhaps 1 peaked intellectually 
in high school. If so, who or whal is 
to blame? Uninspiring college pro- 
fessors, simple apathy, or all that 
helium I inhaled at my 18th birth- 
day party? While I flounder, some

True, cadavers aren't a lot of fun, 
but you know you must be pretty 
impufiaiil when you've got your 
own dead body. Perhaps 1 should 
have been studying science all 
along. Though seemingly an inde- 
pendent pursuit of knowledge and 
expression, science and art ulti- 
mately intersect at the realization of 
truth. Unfortunately, a mighty, 
slavering ihree-hcaded dog guards 
the narrow channel to real science, 
and its name is Chemistfy. 

Though I've taken chemistry 
classes before, and nearly failed 
them, I am still baffled even by the 
ingredients list on a McDonald's 
Orange Dnnk canon. To their cred- 
it. McDonald's executives do not 
attempt to imply that Orange Drink 
is organic in any way, nor would 
they ever attempt to market a 



n Sandwich with Red 
Yellow Condiments Still, in open 
defiance of the supposedly healthy 
age in which we live. Orange Drink 
remains a who's who of the period- 
ic table; il even includes that cele- 
brated gadabout Red »40- 

TTie periodic table is really the 
only aspect of chemistry 1 could 
grasp, and that's only because it 
mostly involved roic memorization. 
Most of the elemenis are pretiy easy 
for me to remember, even loday: H 
stands for hydrogen, Tl is titanium, 
Lm is linoleum. Fm is formica, Ch 
fs ch6comile,'Tw is tweed, aiid Xp 
is argyle. Well, some of them just 
don't make sense. 

Actually, liltle of it really makes 
sense, so most of the doors of sci- 
ence are closed to me. Of course, 
there are the social sciences. 
Psychology, however, is still 
anchored in chemistry, and at the 
same time it also seems like a slick- 
ly choreographed sequel of phrenol- 
ogy. I do enjoy archaeology, bui 
sometimes it seems sort of pre- 
sumptive to try to recreate a society 
based only on a few pots and spear- 
points. How will fulure archaeolo- 
gists perceive our culture when ihcy 
begin to uneanh our omnipresent 
fast food 
restaurants? 
Naturally, 
they will

archaeological reconstruction of the 
Temples of McDonald. 
Archaeologists will catalogue the 
pantheon of ihe McDonaldian age: 
Ronald, the omnipotent father-god; 
Grimace, the wrathful god of war; 
Hamburglar. patron saint of thieves 
and beggars; Early Birdie, ihe sun 
goddess; and the Fry Guys and 
Gals, sylphs and cherubim. They 
will surmise that each temple con- 
tained a long counter which sepa- 
rated the lay people from the poly- 
esier-clad clergy. Cash registers 
served as the dais from which ihe 
faithful received blessings and 
anointment. Afterwards, the flock 
would return to the pews, enjoying 
their holy sacrameni. Paper iray 
sheets and Happy Meal boxes were 
covered with piciographs which 
either chronicled the history of ihe 
gods, or sometimes challenged the 
faithful to find the distinctive 
shapes of deities amid a seemingly 
mundane scene. 

We who live in the 
McDonaldian age know thai our 
priests must give up wealdi. free 
time, friends and self-respect- for 
Ronald is a jealous god. More than 
likely. I, 100. will don the priestly

Homosexually Speaking 

Rejection another kind of death 



Like many of you, 1 have been 
re-evaluating my life this past 
week, but not just because of the 
bombing in Oklahoma City. 
Someone very close to me has just 
suffered a very sad loss ... his fam- 
ily. But what is particularly dis- 
turbing about his loss is that his 
family has not passed away. They 
chose to disown him because he is 
gay. During this time of trauma I 
am trying to compare the two loss- 
es and decide which one is greater. 
1 cannot decide so I ask you, 
would you ralher lose your family 
in a devastating bombing or have 
them discard you like a disposable 
lighter? 

When I 
think about the 
bombing, I 
feci helpless. 
Oh sure, I can 
donate my 
blood and 
send money to 
help the cili- 
2ens of 

Oklahoma 
City rebuild 
"■^^^^^^^^^ iheir lives, but 
is it enough? It's funny, I didn't 
feel this way when thousands of 
Japanese died during their recent 
earthquake. Yet when a signifi- 
cantly lower number of people die 
here in my native country, 1 am 
deeply saddened. 

With my friend, I know 1 can 
do something, Il is important for 
me to show him there is life after 
being disowned. I quickly called 
many of my closest friends and 
shared the disheartening new.s. 
They in lum called my friend and 
lent their support. We all felt a 
real loss to the community. No 
matter how far we think we've 
come, when something like this 
happens, it's a real wake-up call. 

This has made me review my 
own life. My parents have known 
I am gay for over four years and I

Tupper 



am beginning to feel itiey are not 
as accepting as they should he. 
After all they have had plenty of 
lime to deal witli this and should 
be more, I don'i know, happy (?) 
about it. But trutli is I had Easier 
dinner wiih my family and my 
boyfriend at the same table, who 
else can say thai? So I told them 
how much I appreciated ilicm and 
was glad to have them, 

I don't understand how some- 
one can throw someone away like 
that and nol hurl, Have we ns a 
society -Iscjjme sojndividualistic 
that we can afford to discard peo- 
ple who have been a major part of 
our lives because of somcttiing as 
trivial as homosexuality? I know 
how much it hurts to lose someone 
because of death and I do not like 
it. 

And to be rejected by your par- 
ents - the ones who are supposed 
to love you unconditionally. Now 
they have conditions. You will be 
loved if you are not gay I wonder 
if those guilty of the bombing will 
be disowned by their parents for 
committing mass murders and 
destroying government property. 

What is particularly sad about 
my friend's situation is that his 
parents were accepting at rir,si. He 
was told by his dad to be true to 
himself and not worry about those 
who disapprove. His mom was 
setting up a dinner engagement 
with him, bis boyfriend, and his 
parents. And then sixteen hours 
before ihc Oklahoma City bomb- 
ing, he was [old that because he is 
gay he is no longer allowed to 
enter the family house and that he 
must return the keys to the house 
and give back every gift they had 
ever given him. 

Which bomb would affect you 
more?

Buckeyes stage 
come-from-behind victory 



By S. Brani Keltey 
Editur-ln-Chlcf 

The Volkydons' season ended 
Ia5l weekend Uie same as il stancd: 
frustrating and unrulHlling. IPFW 
won ihc firsi Iwo games and led the 
ihird 9-1 before allowing Ohio 
Stale University lo siorm back njid 
win the first semifinal match of the 
MIVA post-season tournament, 

"Obviously we're relieved ttiat 
we won. Wc sLincd out tight in the 
first few games and made a lot of 
errors. Things turned around when 
we started to icla;t," Ohio Stale 
coach Pete Hanson said. 

OSU defeated the Volleydons 
10-15. 12-15. 15-10. 15-13. 16-14 
last Friday night to advance to the 
championship match of the tourna- 
ment against Dall Slate. 

The Cardinals won the tourna- 
ment final over Ohio State 
Saturday night to clinch the MIVA's 
automatic bid to the NCAA volley- 
ball final four tournament May 5 in 
Springfield, Mass. Ball State plays 
UCLA in the semifinals; ihe Bruins 
suffered their only loss of the sea- 
son earlier this year against the 
Cardinals at Springfield. 

IPFW won Ihe fu^t game 15-10 
on the sircntiih ot 3-11 and 6-13 
leads and a 0.471 attack percent- 
age. The Buckeyes hit only 15 per- 
cent. 

The second g.'unc was only a lit- 
tle closer: the Volleydons won 15- 
12 behind a 35 percent kill success 
ratio. They started the game with 
an 8-1 lead before Ohio State took 
over and played to a 10- 10 lie. 

IPrW started the third game 
Willi a 9-1 lead, but wiih die table 



set for a tournament upset, the 
Buckeyes pulled out the tablcclodi. 
outscoring the Volleydons 14-1 the 
rest of Ihc game IPFW erred 10 
times on attack during the game. 

Of those 14 Buckeye points, 
seven were due to IPFW attack 
errors or blocking errors. The 
Volleydons' passing also hurt them 
and the Buckeyes' Steve Potter got 
hot during the third game to help 
rescue Ohio State, 

"In game three, we became real 
tentative, especially with our serv- 
ing, while Ohio Slate became real 
aggressive. Steve Putter said. 
'Screw this. I'm going down 
swinging," and he took over the 
match. After that our passing broke 
down and the momentum shifted," 
IPFW coach Amie Ball said 

Ohio Stale dominated game 
four, starting off with a 3-1 lead 
and remaining two lo eight points 
ahead the rcsl of the game. 

IPFW siarted the fifdi game well 
and stayed ahead until Ihc tenth 
point, when the Buckeyes pulled up 
and played to a 14-14 tie. Ohio 
Stale scored the final two points on 
a kill by Jose Bengoa and a solo 
block by Gary Wrobel. 

"1 give IPFW all the credit in the 
world. Both teams played as hard 
as they could play in the fifth game 
We were just lucky enough to win 
it." Hanson said. 

The Volleydons dominated 
defensively during the match, out- 
blocking the Buckeyes 57-41. The 
'Dons were successful 31 percent 
of the time on attack compared to 
Ohio Stale's 23 percent, but served 
only one ace and had five receiving

Team continues 
rival dominance 



By S. Brant Kelley 
Editor-in-Chief 

The IPFW men's volleyball team 
siarted its quest for its fourth NCAA 
final four bid in five years and con- 
Unucd its dominance against one of 
Ihe league's newer members last 
Thursday afternoon with a win over 
Quincy University in Muncie. Ind. 

"I think we played OK. It was 
just a lough maich. They're a very 
strong team." Quincy coach 
Jcanmarie Becker said. 

The Volleydons defeated the 
Hawks 15-7, 15-4, lS-7 for their 
fifth straight win over Quincy and 
advanced to the MIVA tournament 
semifinals againsi Ohio State 
University the next evening. 

The Hawks have never defeated 
IPFW in the two years they have 
participated in MIVA competition. 

"I thought we played pretty 
focused, considering we were play- 
ing Quincy. a team we defeated 
twice this season. 1 was concerned 
we might look past this match, but 
we did a good job of concentrating 
on what needed to be done. 

"This game is so psychological. 



Slaying focused for three days is 
tough to do. but I thought we did a 
good job." IPFW coach Arnie Ball

Baseball team makes 
tournament first time 



By S. Brant Kelley 
Editor-in-Chief 

This weekend the IPFW base- 
ball team clinched its first-ever 
berth in the GLVC post-season 
baseball loumament and a chance 
to go to the division II college 
worid series. 

With a 21-16 record, the second 
20-plus win season in a row, the 
baseball team could beat last year's 
record -setting mark of 25-16. 

"After our fall season. I sat 
down with the team and our con- 
sensus was that our goal was to 
reach the GLVC tournament," 
IPFW coach lliomas Mulh said. 

The Mastodons entered last 
weekend's doublebeader believing 
they needed to win both games 
against conference-leading Ashland 
University to participate in the 
league's post-season tournament, in 
which the top four teams play. 

The Mastodons received the 



fourth loumament bid ihanlcs to a 
pair of losses by NKU last week- 
end. 

According to Mulh. IPFW, the 
University of Southern Indiana and 
Northern Kentucky University all 
posted 10-8 records, but IPFW had 
the best record againsi the league's 
top three teams, a 4-2 mark ag.iinsi 
St. Joe College, Ashland University 
and Lewis University. 

IPFW won the first game of the 
day, 6-5, to finish ibe conference 
season with a 10-8 record, Steve 
Hahn was the winning pitcher, and 
John Krider finished to preserve the 
wm. 

Ashland won the second game. 
2-0. despite pitcher Travis 
Bradford's three-hit performance 
on the mound. Mulh said he 
thought the game was Bradford's 
second-best performance of the 
year, behind a one-hit outing be had 
at the beginning of the season.
