IPFW finalizes plans for national soccer invitational in 2000 



by Carne Lealhers. 

Chief Reporter 



Preparations are underway for the NCAA 
Division 1 soccer tournament scheduled to be 
held at IPFW Aug. 25-27, 2000. 

"It's been two years of fundraising, trying 
to find sponsorship, and trying to get teams 
lined up," said Terry Stefankiewicz, head 
men's soccer coach for IPFW. 

Eight teams will be playing in the tourna- 
ment including Indiana University, Notre 
Dame, Duke, Rutgers, South Carolina and 
IPFW. Two other teams, probabl) either 



Louisville, Michigan State, or St. Louis will also 
be at the tournament . 

The tournament will be an exhibition, but 
because the season begins the following week, 
it will be an important event for the teams 
attending. 

"These are exhibition games because they 
are prior to the season, but the; are a week 
before the season so they are very important 
to the coaches and all the players," 
Stefankiewicz said. 

According to Stefankiewicz, IPFW is 
attempting to raise enough money to add two 
soccer stadiums to the current complex before 
the tournament in 2000. These stadiums 
would hold approximate!)' 1,500 and 2.000 



people each. 

Besides having these new stadiums for 
future games, the tournament itself is expect- 
ed to have positive effects on IPFW's men's 
soccer team, the university, and the communi- 
ty as a whole. 

"Playing against top-level competition 
only makes you better and also, having this 
tournament will help our recruiting because 
all high school players would love to play 
against national championship type teams. It 
gives not only IPFW, but the city- of Fort 
Wayne, notorietj nationally," Stefankiewicz 
said. 

This event will be an annual tournament 
at IPFW, and Stefankiewicz believes that peo- 



ple from across the Midwest will travel to Fort 
Wayne to see the teams pla) . 

Currently, Stefankiewicz is working with 
the public relations department of the Miami 
Fusion for advice on marketing and advertis- 
ing the tournament. Memos will also be sent 
out to soccer club teams throughout the 
Midwest to inform them of the tournament. 

The tournament is official, and contracts 
will be sent out near the end of May. 

Although the women's teams will not be 
involved this year, in the future, the women's 
teams will be included in the tournament. 



Rules continue to confuse rollerbladers 



by Carrie Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 

Although rollerblading was original!) 
banned on most of the campus in 1996 for 
safety purposes relating to pedestrian traf- 
fic on campus, students are still unable to 
utilize the entire campus during times 
when the campus is not busy. 

"A lot of people were complaining 
because people were rollerblading in and 
out of crowds, going excessively fast, and 
jumping off of steps," said Lauren 
Denhartog, chief of police for IPFW. 

Rollerblading is still allowed north of 
Walb Union on a sidewalk thai loops 
between the Fine Arts building and the 
Hilliard Gates Sports Center. 

According to Denhartog, rollerblading 
is allowed in this area because there is con- 
siderably less pedestrian traffic. However, 
the majority of the campus also has less 
pedestrian traffic on Fridays after 5 p.m. 
and during the weekend and rollerblading 
is not allowed during these times. 

According to Vice Chancellor of 
Financial Affairs Walt Branson, however, 
there is also another concern, 

"The other half of the issue is the 
damage that rollerbladers were doing to 
campus. We felt like IT we could confine 
the rollerblading, we could keep the dam- 
age from occurring," Branson said. 

Branson believes that it would be too 
difficult to enforce a rule allowing 
rollerblading on campus sidewalks but not 
on railings, stairs and other areas that 
could be damaged. 

"It's difficult when you don't actually 
see the bladers doing the things and you 
find the damage later." 

For rollerbladers the biggest problem 
is knowing where they are allowed to 
blade. Man)- have found that the signs pro- 
hibiting rollerblading in certain areas are 
not clearly marked and are not very 
noticeable. 

Mark Quinn, from the Fort Wayne area, 
rollerblading on the campus for the first time w 
he was asked to leave by Police and Safet) . 

"We didn't see any signs, but someone had 
us that we were allowed to skate in certain areas

Courtney Nardin and Jason Ujvari stay within legal' rollerblading 
boundaries. 



we were skating from the parking lot trying to find 
those areas," said Quinn. 

According to Quinn and his friend, the Police 
and Safet)- person said rollerblading was not allowed 
on campus at all. 



Alumni membership 

cards available 

to graduating seniors 



by Adam Taylor, 
Features Editor 



The commencement ceremony for 
seniors graduating in May will be held 
May 12 at 7 p.m. in the Allen Count) 
War Memorial Coliseum. 

Following the ceremony, students 
participating in commencement that 
evening should attend the post-com- 
mencement party in the Expo Hall at 
the Coliseum where they can pick up 
their diplomas, IPFW alumni association 
membership cards and window decals. 

Membership in the IPFW alumni 
association provides many discounts 
and benefits to card-carrying alumni. 

Discounts provided by the alumni 
association include discounts on contin- 
uing education classes, campus athletic 
events, productions at Williams Theatre 
and music department performances. 

Other benefits include discounts in 
memberships to the Gates Fitness 
Center and a chance to apply for schol- 
arships for spouses or children. 

Membership in the IPFW alumni 
association will also come with a mem- 
bership in the alumni association of the 
university from which the graduate 
receives his or her degree. 

The number of free months as a 
card-carrying alumni differs between 
each parent university, however. 

If a student graduates with a 
Purdue degree, that student is given a 
free one-year membership in both the 
Purdue and IPFW's alumni associations. 

Students graduating with an 
Indiana degree receive a free six-month 
membership in IU and IPFW's alumni 
associations. 

The length of the memberships is 
determined by the parent universities, 
according to the IPFW alumni associa- 



tion president Brian Headings. 

Headings also said the)' are con- 
stantly trying to improve the benefits 
given to former IPFW students. 

"We've been trying hard to give 
more benefits for members of the alum- 
ni association to make people think it's 
worth their money and time to join," 
Headings said. "Over the past couple of 
years, we have added more benefits, 
discounts and events to add value for 
each alumni association member. That 
would include the concerts, film series 
and a majority of other things on 
campus." 

Students graduating in May that 
cannot attend the commencement cere- 
mony or post-commencement part) are 
encouraged to stop b) the week follow- 
ing commencement to pick up their 
diploma, according to Marianne 
Messmann, academic ceremonies 
coordinator. 

"If the) r {the students) are graduat- 
ing in May and they're not going to 
Commencement," Messmann said, 
"then they can pick up their diploma in 
the Registrar's Office Monday, May 17." 
This is preferred as it gives the 
Registrar's Office time to deal with new 
students first. 

Jennifer Bosk, Director of IPFW 
Alumni Relations, had some advice for 
graduating seniors to keep in mind. 

"Upon graduation, you do not 
leave your alma mater behind," Bosk 
said. "We ask graduates to remain a 
vital part of IPFW and we hope that 
the)' can share their time and their tal- 
ent with the university in the future." 

For questions regarding alumni 
membership and activities, contact Bosk 
at 481-6807. 

Questions regarding commence- 
ment should be directed to Messmann 
at 481-6460.

William Kristol delivers political views at Omnibus 



by Tracy Powell, 
Staff Writer 



Looking at today's political scene, 
one would be hard pressed to miss 
William Kristol. 

Whether it be on "This Week" with 
Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, "The 
NewsHour" with Jim Lehrer, "Good 
Morning America," or at IPFW, Kristol is 
addressing the question, "A Republican 
Future?" 

The Omnibus Lecture Series finished 
its 1998-99 season April 20 in the Walb 
Union Ballroom with a presentation From 
Kristol, political analyst. 

Before stepping into current issues, 
he hegan discussing the past misgivings 
of local government in the Washington, 
D.C. area, pointing out the humorous 
side of former Mayor Marian Barry's 
term in office. 

Touching on local issues, Kristol 
stated his pleasure in being in Quayle's 
former congressional district. 

"I'm happy to be pulled from 
Washington, as we're suffering from 
post-scandal depression." Kristol said. 

While identifying himself as "the 
token conservative at Harvard" during 
his doctorate studies, Kristol elaborated 
on the definitions of the decades of the 
'80s and the '90s. 

"What are the historians going to 
saj about the 90s?" Kristol asked. 

lie pointed out the last decade was 
characterized with the prominent leaders 
of that era. 

"There was very rare leadership in 
Reagan, Thatcher, and the Pope," Kristol 
said. "And they all came to power within 
two years of each other. That's 
amazing." 




In striking 
contrast, he 
could name no 
political leaders 
for the '90s. 

Clinton and 
Newt Gingrich 
were now "failed 
leaders," leaving 
the '90s to be 
considered an 
odd decade. 

In-depth 
analysis of both 
Republican and 
Democratic lead- 
ers in pursuit of 
party candidac&gt; 
for the next pres- 
idential election 
was provided 
with a first hand 
account. Kristol 
mused about the 
mystery of Vice 
President Al 
Gore's 15 percent 
lag in current popularitj polls against 
Republican front-runner Texas Governor 
George Bush, reasoning that it may indi- 
cate a backlash of distrust of the Clinton 
administration. 

"The election in 2000 is a fork in 
the road," Kristol said. 

Kristol believes that debates will 
become more fundamental regarding 
basic issues in the next IS months. 

What those issues are will be deter- 
mined on new events, such as the out- 
come of the conflict in Kosovo, and how 
Clinton comes out in the approval rat- 
ings up to the time of the election. 

In discussing Quayle's venture for 
the presidency. Kristol was co&gt; in his

obvious support while realistic of what 
media damage can do to one in national 
politics. 

The "potato" misspelling fiasco was 
given to the audience with an insider's 
scoop. 

"Three months later came the 
Murph\ Brown speech." he said, which 
distracted the media from the 
first blunder. 

Kristol returned to his original point 
before ending the lecture, pointing to 
the undefined era of the 90s as a cause 
for the fluid state of politics on Capital 
Hill.

For almost four years The Omnibus Lecture Series has 
been bringing a wide variety of famous visitors to speak .it 
IPFW. 

According to Irene Wallers, director of University 
Relations, a committee works with different agencies and 
sponsors in the community for two lo three months lo put 
the lectures together. 

The committee is particular when it comes to choosing 
a diverse group of individuals lo speak. 

We would like to commend the committee members 
who have worked on the Omnibus Lecture Series for their 
hard work and for bringing such highly-esteemed individu- 
als to a community campus. 

We would also like to thank the English, Bonter, 
Miu hell foundation for supplying a grant and stations 
WBN[-FM(89.1), WJFXFM (107.9) and News Channel 15 for 
publicizing the events. 

All of these lectures are free and open to the general 
public. 

During the fall semester of 1998 and the spring semes- 
ter of 1999 the Omnibus Lecture Series has featured 
Clarence Page, columnist: Jud&gt; Chicago, feminist artist; Joe 
Clark, former principal of East Side High School; Amy 
Hempel, short story writer and William Kris col, ABC news 
analyst. 

These speakers have brought different views and ideas 
to campus and have enriched ihe knowledge and experi- 
ences of members of the community. 

For example, Page's belief that America has to go 
through race to move beyond race was apparent in his lec- 
ture "Race Relations Tor the New Millennium.' 1 

Chicago's experiences and means of expression in ihe 
art world were shocking but inspirational. 

Clark inspired those who want to make a difference in 
their lives. 

"If you are to receive the best, you must give &gt;our 
best, the best must come to you. You must stoop to lift 
mankind up." said Clark. 

Hempel similarly motivated aspiring short story writers 
with her amusing anecdotes. 

The final visitor this semester was Kristol. 

An active member of the political scene, Kristol gave 
timely insights on politicians and current events such as 
Kosovo. 

Clearly, these speakers are indeed diverse and inspira- 
tional and are viewed as leaders in this society. 

Although IPFW is a "commuter campus" and lacks stu- 
dent involvement and funding, it docs not lack effort, hard 
work and good taste. 

IPFW has drawn the community together and has 
earned a respectable repuiaiion thanks lo successful pro- 
grams such as the Omnibus Lectures. ,

Littleton, Colorado: 

Recent Acts of Violence Signs That 
Society Must Change 



by Ben Fruble, 
Slarf Writer 



"One hand reaches out and pulls a lost 
soul from harm while a thousand more 
go unspoken for. They say what good 
have you done by saving just this one. 
It's like whispering a prayer in the fury 
of a storm. And I hear them saying 
you'll never change things and no mat- 
ter what you do it's still the same thing, 
but it's not the world that I am changing. 
I do this so this world will know that it 
will not change me." 
-Garth Brooks, 'The Change* 

I turned on the television shortly 
before 11 p.m. on April 3. The short news 
brief before the actual start of the news said 
that an Indiana State Trooper has been 
killed in the line of duty. A thought rushes 
through my mind that the homicide was 
probably in Indianapolis or Gary. 

However, I quickly learn that the shoot- 
ing was in nearby Decatur. Trooper Cory 
Elson, making a routine traffic stop, was 
senselessly shot and killed by a man with 
an automatic weapon. The reason; suspect 
Mark Uchtenberger was upset about his last 
ticket. 

Cory Elson's death came just hours 
before Easier-the day when Christians cele- 
brate Jesus Christ's rising so many years 
ago. It is supposed to be a joyous time, 
much like Christmas. Instead. Elson lost his 
life at the age of 26. four months after he 
graduated from ihe police academy, His 
death, unfortunately, became the topic of 
conversation for concerned citizens at 
many Easter meals across the state. 

April 20, I got home from class at IPFW. 
I eventually got around to checking my e- 
mail. Yahool's news bulletin stated that up 
to 25 were dead in a Colorado school shoot- 
ing (though the total was actually 15). Up to 
25 deadl Last year's school shootings were 
tragic, but were not nearly as gruesome as 
this shooting. How could someone do such a 
thing? Many of the twelve slain students 
were not that much younger than 1 am or 
many of you reading this article. It was a 
tragic scene that 1, as a young person, could 
relate to. 

Friday, I happened to hear about a 
scare at Heritage High School. Heritage, my 
old school, was evacuated after a fifteen- 
year-old decided to release chemicals into 
the school as a prank. Emergency officials 
were called out, along with EMS and fire 



uniis, to verify that the chemicals were not 
dangerous. They turned out to be harmless 
pesticides. How sad that this young person 
made such a foolish prank after a major 
high school tragedy just occurred. 

Last week, two students were arrested 
at a Mooresville, Ind., school after Irving to 
bring a pipe bomb into the school. In 
Louisiana, a thirteen-year-old girl was acci- 
dentally shot in the jaw while at school last 
Thursday. Many "copycat scenes" like 
Littleton or people making pranks in bad 
taste have been occurring throughout our 
country. 

The caring outreach by most Americans 
following the Colorado shootings was touch- 
ing. However, it was in some ways hypocriti- 
cal or contradictory. Americans, as an 
entire nation, mourn for such recent 
tragedies like the Littleton shootings. 

Until such a tragedy occurred, we likely 
did not know where Littleton, Colorado, 
was. We probably were not worried about 
two lunatics going on a shooting rampage. 
We probably did not care aboui the stu- 
dents until it happened. 

The past weeks have shown us that we 
need to care about our children, fellow stu- 
dents, friends, relatives, or anyone in need 
of help. It is lime to step up and take con- 
trol of our lives and the lives of our chil- 
dren. Where were the parents of the sus- 
pects in the Colorado shootings? How do 



Parents, friends, classmates and society 
as a whole have major responsibilities. We 
have a responsibility to be there for some- 
one when a time of need arises. We also 
have a responsibility to not push someone 
too far. A combination of factors of such 
problems are, in my opinion, the cause of 
the recent string of shootings. 

Something has to change before shoot- 
ings and scares like the one in Jonesboro. 
Arkansas, shooting and the recent tragedy 
in Littleton, Colorado, becomes a common 



"This heart still believes that love and 
mercy still exist while all the hatreds 
rage and so many say that love is all but 
pointless in madness such as this... As 
long as one heart still holds on, then 
hope is never really gone."

Letter to the Editor 



Kosovo: 

Take stronger action 



To My Fellow Students 



. IPFW: 



The events of the past week cannot be 
ignored. NATO did strike Serb TV cwice, 
taking ii off the air, but only for a few- 
hours both times. Russia got Milosevic to 
agree to a UN armed peacekeeping force, 
but Milosevic later added more restrictions 
thai were not in the Russian agreement, 
those restrictions being: 1) a civilian 
peacekeeping force (no weapons); 2) 
Serbia will not withdraw the troops from 
Kosovo; and 3) no NATO countries that 
participated in the bombings could send 
representatives. This is a truly unaccept- 
able peace agreement. The Yugoslavian 
government has already shown its ability 
to lie to Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia, 
and to NATO and the U.S. Peace can only 
be achieved if and when the refugees 
return to Kosovo. The Yugoslavian govern- 
ment has more or less created a KLA that 
was not too strong, but has been the best 
requirement technique for the KLA. 

I talked to some Serbian friends. I 
even told them to give me something and I 
would do my best to include their lexi in 
my article. I was sent a URL of an 
American that has been living in Serbia 
that talked about the hardships the bomb- 
ing has caused. He has a new daughter 
who came home from the hospital on ihe 
day the bombing began, but he does not 
think that he will be able to leave with his 
family. I am sorry for the hardships the 
bombing has caused Yugoslavia, but ihe 
government has caused these hardships by 
the forced removal of Yugoslavian citizens 
in Kosovo. Some of the Kosovars might be 
Albanian, but they were still Yugoslavian 
citizens. NATO wants everyone to live in 
peace and prosperity. 

Mr. Milosevic, the last remaining dicta- 
tor in Europe, brought on ihe NATO bomb- 
ing by his actions. Milosevic took away the 
right of Kosovars to have local elections. 
The police forces to protect the 
Yugoslavian citizens in Kosovo are onlv 
Serbian. Mis actions precipitated NATO 
bombings and hopefully will not cause 
ground troops lo be involved. If the U.S. 
would not be against ground troops. NATO 
ground troops would already be there. 
The French and the British want ground 
troops, but it is the U.S. that is leading 
against ground troops. 

The NATO countries have instated an 
oil embargo against Yugoslavia, but the 
Russians have already said they will meet 
Iheir e.visting contracts. The NATi &gt; coun- 
tries, including the U.S., should purchase 
these shipments at 110 percent lo 125 per- 
cent of the price agreed upon by the Serbs. 
There is no use in making the Russians 
angrier and the money would help ihe 
Russian economy. Economics drive ihe 



world and ihe Soviets found thai out too 
late. Thai is why ihere is no USSR any- 
more. 1 have talked lo many people on the 
Internet from all over the world. Some of 
those countries include: England, Belgium, 
Hungary, China. Hong Kong, the 
Philippines. Japan, Australia, Algeria, 
Angola, Argentina, Chile, Brazil. Turkey, 
Italy, Canada, and the U.S. Some of the 
people from ihe U.S. were originally citi- 
zens from these other countries, I have 
talked to people from some other coun- 
tries, but i cannot remember all of the 
countries. I am straightforward and I ask 
them, "It seems all other countries hate 
Americans, but they want to be just like 
America. Why?" The most frequent reply I 
get is that they do not hate Americans, and 
they do like America. Some even said they 
are more afraid of Russia than America. 
Even the Serbs do not hate Americans. The 
Serbs must realize that Americans do not 
hate Ihe Serbs, but the actions of the 
Serbian government. 

Russia might want to get into this 
because the Serbian government and the 
Russian government have tried to build up 
a "Russian" Serbia. The Serbs were 
removed from Russia many years ago, 
before the "New World" was known. The 
Serbs were removed by the Russians in the 
same way ihe Serbs are trying to remove 
the ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. I have 
not met a Serb who speaks Russian, but I 
know there are probably Serbs that do 
speak Russian, just as there are Americans 
that speak Serbo-Croatian. I do hot want to 
see the senseless deaihs of Yugoslavian citi- 
zens that happen to be of Albanian 
descent. 

The U.S. needs lo make its position of 
helping the Serbian people better known. 
The U.S. does not want to cause death, just 
as the NATO countries do not want to 
cause death, bui the deaths musi occur in 
order to save ihe lives of the Kosovars. 
The deaths caused by the NATO bombing 
are fewer than the deaihs committed by 
the Yugoslavian government, which is 
almost all Serbian. 

Mr. Brunson and, more importantly, 
Mr. Chomsky arc trying to change the sub- 
ject. The subject is not why we are doing 
this 10 Yugoslavia while these other coun- 
tries that are our allies are allowed to cre- 
ate destruction. The subject should be that 
we should treat these oiher countries the 
same waj Yugoslavia has been treated. Ask 
and plead nicel; and then, after seven 
years of pleading, lake stronger action.

Everyday Epiphanies: 

'All experience is an arch, to build upon 1 



by Gail Ruble-Crawford, 
Editor 



Well, this is my last column as 
Editor, It's taken six years, but I'm 
finally going to graduate. I'm glad to 
he done with school, but there's a pan 
of me that's scared and nervous about 
what happens after college. I spent 
most of last night thinking about what 
I've learned in the last two years while 
working at The Communicator. I dis- 
covered that I've learned quite a lot, 
and maybe some of what I've learned 
in the last two years will help you in 
some way. 

1. I learned that life is a series 
of choices that no one but me 
can make for myself. I'm way too 
old to be relying on the advice of oth- 
ers to decide things. I've gotta do 
things for myself. 1 also learned that 
I'm lucky because my life choices have 
been pretty good so far, and that's all 
that separates me from being one of 
those "Hey, have you heard about that 
girl in Indiana" stories. 

2. 1 learned that silence teach- 
es. I'm extremely talkative by nature, 
but I have discovered that silence is a 
powerful tool for seeing inside myself. 
We all need moments of quiet so that 
we can reflect on our lives. What 
makes silence such a wonderful thing 
is what we receive from those 
moments of silence. 

3. 1 learned that 1 don't like 
being forced to make choices 
about the life and death of 
another of this planet's crea- 
tures. I had to make the decision 
whether to have my dog put to sleep, 
and I couldn't do it the first time I 
contemplated it. The second time, I 
still couldn't quite deal with it, hut I 
knew that I had to do what was right, 
even though it wasn't what my heart 

t wanted. I learned that the right thing 
to do isn't always the easiest thing to 



do. 

4. I learned that I'm stronger 
than 1 thought I was. I made per- 
sonal life choice to become vegetarian 
over two years ago. I made that choice . 
for moral reasons. I know that I have 
been silent during the recent argu- 
ments both for and against vegetarian- 
ism here in The Communicator, but 
I'm not a fan of forcing others to 
accept my viewpoints. Uesides, vege- 
tarianism, contrary to a recent Letter 
to the Editor that we ran, has nothing 
to do with "being better than" other 
people. It's about health or a particu- 
lar moral stance for most people who 
espouse its tenets. Neither my hus- 
band nor 1 would force our soon-to-be- 
born child to follow our dietary 
lifestyle, either. If my child wants a 
hamburger or a taco, he or she can 
have it. It's perfectly fine with me. Not 
every vegetarian is a militant, trying 
hard to force his or her opinion down 
the throats of passers by. 
Vegetarianism is not an easy lifestyle, 
but I truly like it. 

5. / learned that It is okay to be 
proud of my family. The older I 
get, the more that I realize just how 
much I love my parents and my 
younger brothers. There comes a point 
in life where the relationships that you 
have with those around you hit a 
crossroads, and you have the option of 
making the most of what is there or 
letting what you have fall away. I 
chose to make the most of what I had, 
and I reel that I'm happier and richer 
for the choice that I made. 

6. / learned that 1 do have the 
courage to both have a baby 
and start graduate school. Doing 
these things-will not slow down my 
plans for the future. Conversely, I 
think that they will only serve to make 
me stronger. Now that I'm about to 
have a baby, I do feel as if I have a 
solid grasp on my life, and I'm proud 
that I was able to make these radical 



decisions. I'm looking forward 
to starling the next phase of my 
life. 

7. / learned that some- 
times life knows you bet- 
ter than you know your- 
self. Since 1 was young, f have 
always loved to write. I have alwa&gt;s 
found writing to be a sort of mental 
"release" for me, and I nourished it all 
through high school. Somehow, for 
some unknown, unexplainable reason, 
I stopped writing. I put it away on a 
shelf, pretending that I needed to 
focus on "serious" things instead. So 1 
got myself a "real" job. and spent 
three years trying in vain to convince 
myself that I could like working in that 
career, that it was the "serious" thing 
to do. However, once a professor here 
on campus urged me to get a job at 
The Communicator, the line between 
the "right" thing to do and the 
"wrong" thing to do blurred more and 
more. It blurred until I couldn't ignore 
it anymore. I sat, day in and day out, 
at a miserable job, trying so hard to 
make myself like it because that was 
the "right" thing to do. Then I came to 
classes in the afternoon and the paper 
at night and felt my misery lift off of 
my shoulders. The moment I started 
typing, all of the bad things just went 
away. I realized one day that I just 
couldn't do anything so mentally sti- 
fling for a job; so 1 just quit one day, 
with no warning whatsoever. I was ter- 
rified that I had made a mistake, and 
feared that I had destroyed my 
chances at another "serious" job. But 
you know what? 1 had never felt so 
strong and empowered before. 1 found 
out how truly strong I really was that 
day. I am thankful every day since 
that I was able to take a leap of faith 
and do what made me happy, not 
what made me a big fat paycheck. I 
have yet to regret my decision. 

All in all, 1 think that I've spent 
the last two years or my life searching 
my soul, and I've taken my readers 




along for the nde. I hope that maybe 1 
was able to inspire jou to look into 
yourselves to find strength, to trust 
yourselves and to know that whatever 
happens in your life, jou will find a 
way to overcome it. 

I'm about to become a mother, 
I'm happily married and 1 am lucky to 
have had this experience. Without it, 1 
would have just slacked off and let my 
college years pass me by. This job has 
allowed me to "find" myseir a bit. 
Thank you for experiencing it with me.

All About the Movies: Pushing Tin'JUes high 



by Ben Freese, 
Staff Writer 



One never quite knows exactly 
what to expect when watching a film 
featuring the likes of Billy Bob 
Thornton or John Cusack, let a'lone a 
movie that stars both of these unique 
individuals. 

There has always been enjoyment 
for me in watching two actors like 
Thornton and Cusack on the silver 
screen. 

One can never quite guess what 
they're about to give us. and that's 
reflected in their work. 

I immensely enjoyed Cusack's off- 
the-wall film, "Gross Point Blank," a 
movie about a hitman with a heart who 
wants his old girlfriend back. 

Thornton, for the last several 
years, has produced two incredible 
films, "A Simple Plan," and the haunt- 
ing "Slingblade." 

Both of Thornton's roles in those 
films were Oscar-nominated and I 
believe he should have won both times. 
In fact, "Slingblade" is one of my 
favorite films and I recommend it to 
everybody reading this article. 

In the new motion picture, 
"Pushing Tin," Thornton and Cusack 
play air traffic controllers who are 
both a little bit too free-spirited, overly 
competitive, and, most importantly, 
quite the self-contained lunatics. 

In their world, the thrill of the job 
is what really counts and, after Billy 
Bob struts into Cusack's building, the 
excitement suddenly centers around 
their ability to outdo each other. 

After that, nothing really matters, 
as both men sacrifice their women 
(albeit in different ways), their lives, 
and their sanity along the way to win 
and be the best that there is at the job 
of "pushing tin." 

In "Pushing Tin," the premise of 
the film itself is different than what 
we're used to, but the underlying 
struggle between the two workers is a 
familiar area. 

What truly makes this picture 
unique is the casting used to take an 
otherwise mundane idea and make it 
into an entertaining movie. 

John Cusack gives us a likable 
hero that is prone to making mistakes, 
but is so damn adorable that every- 
body can eventually forgive him for 
his wrong-doings.

On the other hand, Bill) Bob 
Thornton gives us a mysterious 
stranger who is something of an anti- 
hero and always a rebel. 

In contrast to Cusack gaining the 
audience's sympathy, we wonder every 
time Bill) Bob's on the screen if he'll 
soon kill someone. 

As the film progresses, we come to 
a kind of understanding (sort of) with 
the Thornton character that he's not 
diabolical, he's simply the best. 

The fact that Cusack is more of a 
center-of-attention, party-type who's 
prone to error and basic carnal 
instincts, makes for a great balancing 
act to Thornton's rebellious heathen. 

While Cusack misses basketball 
shots and drinks loo much, all in the 
name of fun, Thornton's character 
almost never makes mistakes and 
would rather ride aimlessly on his 
motorcycle by himself than ever drink 
himself into unconsciousness. 

Regardless of their complete!) 
opposite outlooks on life, they sort of 
develop a friendship to go along with 
their rivalry. Even being comrades 
doesn't keep them from messing up 
each others lives, though. 

It isn't long before Cusack is 
obsessed with destroying his superior 
and each man is vying to command 
and conquer the other. 

The actresses who portray the 
respective wives are golden choices 
and they really give us a whole new 
sense of the differing ways in which 
stressed-out wives deal with hostility 
and depression. 

Cate Blanche! (unrecognizable 
from her Oscar-nominated starring 
role in "Elizabeth") is the wife of 
Cusack, brimming with hidden intensi- 
ty the first time we see her in the Him. 
It is obvious that she isn't happy 
and is just living day to day to appease 
her selfish husband. 

She tries to find new avenues 
down which 10 take her daily routine 
while Cusack is on the job oc out booz- ■ 
ing it up with his friends. 

, That path eventually winds up 
leading to Bill) Bob Thornton, who's 
more her equal as the non-alcoholic, 
yet quiet, introverted type. 

Angelina Jolie (Oscar-nominated 
actor Jon Voight's daughter, who per- 
formed well both in "Gia" and "George 
Wallace'l'tiplays' the part of the other 
wife-a_ bcauiiful,..pany-type, ) oungcr 
woman that fell in love with the older, 



wiser Thornton character. 

Unfortunately. Bilh Bob has seri- 
ous issues with life and winds up 
spending most nights away from her, 
riding around town searching for....Can 
you see what's coming? 

Fun-guy Cusack pursues the lonely 
Jolie character? If you guessed that, 
then you're right, bui the romantic 
switch-around is one of the only pre- 
dictable things about this film. 

Most movies don't begin with a 
hpro who ends up being almost more 
of a villain than the antagonist. 

Cusack, as the film progresses, 
becomes so obsessed with winning the 
proverbial "game," that the audience 
certain!)- can no longer sympathize 
with him and will basicall) only accept 
him again if he finds his redemption. 

True, this issue has been dealt 
with in other movies, but usually the 
villain then becomes the hero. 

Not in this ambitious film. Billy 
Bob remains the ever-present obstacle 
in Cusack's way, who just goes about 
his job and continues to be himself 
{the bad husband trying to find him- 
self)- 

Both men, though, are not terrible 
people; they're just flawed in one way 
or another. Cusack and Thornton are 
actually better people than they're 
originally made out to be in this movie. 

The unpredictable nature of the 
story doesn't stop there, either. 



In fact, b) the latter part of the 
movie, we are quickly realizing that 
each woman loves her original man 
more than first anticipated. 

In fact, the romantic element func- 
tions more, as is discovered, to height- 
en the competitive situation, rather 
than to shift these people's lives 
around to the new person that they 
"should" be with. 

I enjoyed this movie because it 
was hard to sec where it was headed. 

"Pushing Tin" was entertaining, 
funny, sad, exciting and even uplifting. 

Rare!) does a film go to such 
lengths to do this Tor the audience and 
send a good message. 

Basically, it's a lot like real life. 
Mistakes are made, feelings are hurt, 
and the battle between two opposing 
forces rages on. 

B) the end, we can understand 
what the characters have gone through 
and it makes it all the more satisfying 
when Cusack can finally come to some 
kind of acceptance of the reality that 
he faces. 

Cool off, stop obsessing, and keep 
your life under control seems to be the 
focus of this film and "Pushing Tin" 
does an excellent job of conveying 
those important ideas.

SAB brings Skavossas 
to JPFls) 



by Mishanna Wood, 
News Editor 



The IPFW Student 
Activities Board and the local 
band Skavossas made Walb 
Ballroom an atmosphere filled 
with pizza, tunes and dancing 
last Thursday evening. 

"I always enjoy the con- 
certs because they get the 
crowd going and it's ener- 
getic," said junior Lesley 
Smoots. 

According to Adrienne 
Dominguez, a member of SAB, 
the band was the third and 
final group of the local hand 
scries sponsored by SAB. 

The concerts are free and 
open to the public. 

"We tried to open this up 
to anybody. The only require- 
ment was to have a student in 
the band," said Dominguez. 

One of the band members 
is a former IPFW student who 
took a leave last semester. 

"I'm really excited about 
it. This is the first time I've 
ever seen them," said Lisa 
Coomer, a sophomore at 
IPFW. 

Despite a rain delay, 
change of sound equipment 
and the smell of burning 
wood, Skavossas made it 
through for their fans. 

After the Dominos pizza 



was eaten, the chairs were 
removed from the front of the 
stage and the lights were 
turned down as the music 
began. 

As soon as the band 
began plaj ing their first song 
the audience let loose and 
tore up the dance floor. 

The age group or audi- 
ence dancers ranged from 
young children to middle- 
aged adults. 

"It's nice to have an 
evening event and to have a 
showing of IPFW students, 
high school students and 
other students," said Jencc' 
Johnson, the pro-temp of SAB. 
The upbeat combination 
of blasting trumpets, drum 
beats, guitar chords and voic- 
es of Skavossas members 
worked in unison to create 
"ska" music. 

According to Skavossas 
trumpet player, Jay Freimuih, 
"ska"is a combination of 
mento jazz music from 
Jamaica and R&amp;B music. 

Frcimuth added that ska 
music started reggae and rock 
and has been around since 
the early 1960s. 

Freimuih said Justin 
Maloney, a guitar player, went 
to see the group "Pie Tasters" 
in Toledo and was hooked on 
ska and wanted to start a 
band. 



Skavossas performed a 
variety of old and new songs. 

Some of the songs that 
the) played, such as "The Best 
Incentive," "Tell Her," and 
"Slow Down," were from their 
next album, which they will 
begin recording in June. 

As the band played on, 
the group of dancers contin- 
ued to grow. At one point, the 
band had the audience jump- 
ing up and down to the beat 
of the music. 

One man was sitting on 
another man's shoulders. 

During the final song and 
last dance, Skavossas thanked 
their fans and SAB. 

"That was so totally awe- 
some! Thej' were real loud 
and energetic. They just have 
fun," exclaimed Coomer after 
the concert. 

"It was very hot and a lot 
of fun. Everyone seemed 
great," said Laddie, a drum- 
mer for the band. 

Dominguez said that the 
goal was to have everybody 
come out and get a little 
involved with the campus and 
SAB. 

Dominguez encourages 
anyone who is interested to 
join SAB.

'Anti-Christ' of the music industry 
makes his return to the Coliseum 



by Jasen 
Staff Writer 



In the atways-to-be-outdone world of 
"shock rock," names come and go, and some 
pick up followers along the way. 

Acts such as Alice Cooper, GWAR, Gi Gi 
Allen and countless other parents' nightmares 
have haunted the speakers and stages of 
young America. The lyrics are angst-ridden, 
the guitars are loud and the gimmicks are 
flashy. 

Ever)' generation of rebellious teenagers 
has at least one of these rockers and today's 
Gen-Xers are no exception. 

The anti-christ himself, Marilyn Hanson, 
seems to be todaj J s spokes-ghoul. 

The Memorial Coliseum got another dose 
of Manson's less than unique brand of may- 
hem Saturday, April 17. 

The dark one had visited Fort Wayne once 
before, opposed by a very loud group of 
Christian radicals trying «&gt; thwart the concert. 

Posters and banners waved in the air, but 
the show went on. 

Well, this time the concert was staged with 
absolutely no protest on the Coliseum 
grounds. 

As I recall, two years ago. when Manson 
played, it was a nice day, but April 17, the 
weather was cold and rainy. 

Was the lack of conflict due to Marilyn's 
shock wearing off, or were the original protest- 
ers just "fair weather" Christians? 

The show sold about half the tickets, 
which couldn't have been very pleasing to the 
promoters (that's probably the reason I got a 
photo pass in the first place, considering the 
closely guarded tour). 

This could be due in part to the drop off 
of tour mates Hole and Monster Magnet, or 
perhaps Manson's shocking, naught)' appeal is 
wearing off. 

One thing remained the same, though-the 
ample supply of face paint and security 



guards. 

The hired muscle was there, but they 
must have cut back on the red meat in the 
catering room because, from what I saw, fans 
were treated a bit more like people. 

The onl&gt; exception I saw was one drunken 
fellow who was escorted out by some sheriffs, 
apparently for removing his shirt. 

As to be expected, the fans were dressed 
to the hilt in the finest garments, ready for ah 
extravagant evening on the town. 

There was the usual Gothic crowd, don- 
ning the black nails, black hair, black eyeliner 
and black nylons. The girls dressed up, loo. 

Some fans went that extra step, though. 
One young lad had colored the upper part of 
his face black with what appeared 10 be a 
magic marker (hey, it's cheaper than a tattoo) 
and another was wearing a tribute to Manson's 
new "glam" look by sporting a green-colored, 
bra-like top that looked suspiciously like it was 
made of duct tape. 

Oh, did I mention before that the tour was 
closely-guarded? 

Well, the Manson camp was so concerned 
about too many images of the band floating 
around that I was asked to leave the show after 
my three songs were up. 

My reaction to this outrage, of course, was 
that of quiet resignation, but boy howdy are 
those people off my Halloween card list. 

The numbers I saw, though, weren't bad, 
and it didn't feel like I got too much spit on 
me from fans showing their own special kind 
of love for Manson whenever he came to the 
front of the stage (occupational hazard). 

My guess is that in a few years, the 
Manson monster will be toned down a bit (a 
duet with Paula Cole?) or simply become a 
worn down bumper sticker on the back of 
some Plymouth, barreling through the 
Midwestern night. Only time will tell.

along to corrupt my virgin mind, this is Jasen

Movie Column: 

Can Darth Vader sink the Titanic, or will it go on and 
on and on and...??? 



Well, you can imagine 
ty surprise and dismay 
hen I discovered the count- 
down to May 19th had noth- 
ng to do with my birthday! 

Instead, all the fuss was 
about some movie! I had just 
gotten back to my office, 
hung up m&gt; trenchcoat and 
was catching up on the latest 
n I saw the countdown. 
and then my bubble burst. 

Not willing to let my 
readers down, though, I 
decided to research this 
hing. 

According to columnist 
Jeff Gouda in Entertainment 
Asylum's Hollywood Wire, 
this fourth Star Wars saga, 
"The Phantom Menace," is 
actually the first, and the 
first was actual!)' the fourth, 
and the 7th, 8th, and 9th 
may never pan out unless, by 
2005, hi/ honor, the gum of 
is and gadgets, George 
Lucas, has a change of heart. 

Also, according to 
Gouda, the original Obi Wan 
has, dare we say it. become 
unbeliever." 

As Sir Alec Guinness, also 
known as Obi Wan Kenobi, 
proclaims, "Twenty years 
ago, when the film was first 
shown, it had a freshness; it 
so had a sense of moral 
good fun. But then I began to 
be uneasy at the influence it 
might be having, t shrivel 
nside each time it is men- 
ioned." 

Obi Wan a-shrivel7 We 
ire aghast! Gouda claims 
:hat there are, even now, 
nearly 7,000 web sites devot- 
ed to the film, and it does 
appear to have assumed a life 
of its own. 

Shades of Frankenstein. 
Bui to the uninitiated, 
and in all fairness to all the 
Starskis and Warskis out 
there, IT really is a big special 
effects bonanza. 

Mr. Gouda states that the 



by Donald Wesiover, Esq. 

original Star Wars weighed in 
at a respectable 500 special 
effects, but "The Phantom" 
will tip the scales at a formi- 
dable 2,500, with a reach of 
millions of light years. 

According to Mr. Gouda, 
Lucas believes that the draw 
of his movies has little to do 
with the effects, but however. 
in another place, Gouda is 
quoted as saying, "Lucas has 
always maintained that the 
main reason he waited almost 
20 years to revisit Star Wars 
was due to special effects 
technology limitations." 

So, if you happen to be 
wondering if it might possi- 
bly be the special fx, or, on 
the other hand, if it might 
have more to do with the spe- 
cial fx— believe it: It's the 
special effects. 

Your humble Private Ear 
doesn't think that the faithful 
in New York were paying S8 a 
head to view the trailer for 
"The Bridges of Madison 
County." 

But. not being one to 
rely on Hollywood group- 
think or hype and hoopla— 
and also knowing that I have 
a reputation to uphold-l 
immediately shook myself as 
Sampson had at one time 
been wont to do, settled 
myself deeper into the couch, 
popped in "Fried Green 
Tomatoes" and sent my 
cohorts marching. 

On reviewing the results 
of their straw poll, 1 found 
that the answers to the query 
of "Do you have plans to go 
see the new Star Wars 
movie?" were pretty much 
split down the middle. 

Out of 26 respondents, 
13 reported that they would 
be going to see "The 
Phantom" and, let me see, 
using my newfound statistics 
training, that would be 13 
opposed, which would be 
approximately, oh, say, 50 



percent. 

Also, gender did 
appear to make a great deal 
of difference, as, out of if 
total yeas, 6 were male and 
were female. 

Out of the total nays, 
were male and the rest were 
re male. 

Among those who v 
interviewed, several appeared 
to be quite adamant. 

When Ted A. was asked 
he replied, "Sit down and lei 
me tell you all about it." 

He then proceeded tc 
explain that he and some* 
friends were planning to pos- 
sibly gel there in the evening, 
have a cookout and maj be 
spend the night on the nigh! 
before opening. 

When Andrea M. 
approached, her response 
was an enthusiastic, "Oh, 
yeah, opening night!" She 
also responded further, "My 
boyfriend has a Darth Vader 
tattoo and he'll be going 
me opening night." 

Man. can you be more 
"in" than lhat? When the 
lady with her, Katherine R. 
was asked, she wanted to 
make it clear that, "My 
answer is— oh, yeah, also!" 

When asked if. she w&lt; 
be going on opening night 
she said thai she didn't kno' 
if it would be opening night, 
but that she would definitely 
be going. 

She added that her 
eleven-year-old son is a big 
Star Wars fan. 

Also, according

Lassanske named to All-GLVC team 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 



IPFWs Ben Lassanske was named to the 
Men's Tennis Greal Lakes Valley Conference 
team. 

Lassanske, a sophomore, has made quite 
the impression on head coach J. Webb Horton. 

He stepped up and played Number 1 sin- 
gles for the team and finished with an impres- 
sive 7-1 conference record. 

His recent success includes a victory over 
the 1998 GLVC Player of the Year Mike 
Reither. 

Lassanske transferred to IPFW from the 
Universitj of Indianapolis this fall and has 
been a leader by example. 



Lassanske is a competitor and has been a 
nice fit in Horton's "Warrior-like" team men- 
tality. 

Lassanske looks to finish out his tennis 
career here at IPFW and should be a corner- 
stone to the future of the team's success. 

He was joined by former teammates 
David Litman, Brandon Bales and Scott Riggle 
from Indianapolis. 

Other GLVC players are Andrew Majxner 
and John Benedyk, Southern Indiana; Kyle 
Olson, Bcllarmine; Scott Goodyear, Missouri- 
St. Louis and Tony Perrino, Lewis. 

Last Year's Player of the Year SIU- 
Edwardsville's Mike Reither finished fourth in 
the voting while Edgar Linares took home top 
MVP honors to round out the All-GLVC team.

ranking of fourth in 1994. 

Along with this prestigious 
icam honor, Head Coach Arnie Ball 
was announced MIVA Coach of the

Ball has had man) honors and 
has been a cornerstone to this pro-

be Ball's ultimate reward.
