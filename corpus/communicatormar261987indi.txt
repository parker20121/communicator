IPFW gets approval for MBA 



By JOHN McGAULEY 
Chief Reporter 

In response lo community and local 
business interest, IPFW has received 
approval for a new Masters in Business 
Administration program, "it's a shame 
we didn't have ithe masters programi 
here ten years ago," Chancellor 
Thomas Wallace said. 

Wallace said that the interest in 
upgrading Ihe current Masters of 
Science in Business Administration to 
Ihe MBA has been present in the 
community for some time, "Any urban 
area would have a demand for tjie 
masters program." Wallace said, 
pointing lo IPFW's interaction with the 
community. He continued to say that 
some area employers have related 
difficulties to him in recruiting 
potential employees when no possibility 
to upgrade Itieir education to the 



masters level exists. Wallace said that 
Ihe MBA is a "very sought after 
degree," and one that most students 
would prefer lo earn. 

Anolher factor in bringing the MBA 
lo Fort Wayne according to Wallace 
was the fact th-it IPFW doesn't have 
many graduate programs, and that 
adding (he new program could improve 
enrollment. He cited the fact Ihat for 
each opening in lUPUI's MBA 
program, five applicants are waiting to 
get in. 

Dr. George Bullion, director of IPF- 
W's business and economies division, 
stressed that while llie new program 
has been approved for Implementation, 
It has yet lo be put inlo place, "In my 
opinion, we don't have it yet," he said, 
pointing out that no budget or im- 
plementation plan has been approved 



for the program and a number of 
operational details have yet to be 
worked out. Bullion said that no more 
details will be known until mid-May. 
when the state approves a budget for 
the next fiscal year, Wallace said that 
S225,000 is being sought for initial im- 
plementation and hiring of new faculty. 

Wallace expressed a hope that the 
I.U, controlled program will be in place 
by fall, but Bullion thinks that such a 
target is not likely to be met, con- 
sidering the work lobe completed. "I'm 
hopeful tliat it might be in place by fall, 
but reahstically, I don'l think it will 
be," he said, 

Wallace said that Ihe transition would 
be accomplished by retaining the 
current MSBA structure, with some 
slight modifications lo class content 
Bullion said that the new program is 
mainly a name change, with some 



adjusLmenl to concentration options, 
and that half of those studenls wishing 
to get into the new masters program 
would have to do nothing to make the 
transition. The other half would need to 
pick up some additional classes to fulfill 
program requirements. 

Both Wallace and Bullion agreed thai 
many students are eager to get into (he 
masters program. Wallace called it 
"the degree of choice " Bullion 
predicted thai around 160 people would 
be involved In the program within a 
year or two of its initiation. 

While the new MBA program has only 
been approved for the Northwest. South 
Bend and Fort Wayne Indiana -Purdue 
campuses, Wallace said that Ihere is 
interest in taking the program lo other 
institutions, such as the Kokomo 



Budget nears zero for English department 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
EdItor-in-Chief 

Ihe supphes and expense budget used by the department of English and 
linguistics is in danger of meeting its demise, if the amount left in the fund's pool is 
any indication. 

Approximately 5283 is left in the department's supplies and expense budget, an 
amount that has lo last until June 30 of this year. The department was allocated 
Sie.fXiO for supplies and expenses for the 1986-87 academic year, Roberl Olten, 
chair of the department of English and hnguistics, said on Tuesday The money in 
the fund is used by the department's 23 full-lime laculty members, 24 parl-time 
faculty members, and its eight graduate assistants. 

"The problem in the syslem," Otlen said, "is that we have been living with a low 
percentage increase by the state legislature. It's nothing more complex than 
that." 

Otlen said (he problem with the budget was that there was not much flexibility in 
It He said that in his four years as chair, the only changes or increases in Ihe 
budget have been percentage increases. According to Otlen, each year's budget 
adds up to the amount of the previous year's budgel, plus the percentage increase 
approved by the stale legislature. 

The budget is used in three broad categories, Olten said. A numberof things are 
included in the three categories of teaching materials, faculty research and 
departmental programs. 

Some of I he affected items will be phone calls and the amount of duplications Ihe 
English professors and instructors will be able to provide to ibeir students. 

Following are several of the restrictions being placed on the faculty. 

— No long dislance phone calls may be made (except on SU VON I without prior 
approval by the departmental chair. 

— No duplicating of class materials can be made other than exams and quizzes. 
1 his applies lo both photocopying and Ihe use of dittoes. 

— No duplication of intradepartmental communication except for committee 
business or search and screen business. Faculty should make more use of bulletin

boards, telephone or door-to-door messages. 

— No postage for personal cor res Don den ce or manuscripts. A smaU amount of 
postage is available to those who need the money to cover official departmental 
business, 

— No duplicating of personal research materials. Olten said that he has secured 
the funds necessary for his faculty members lo cover the cost of duplicating 
semester exams and Summer Session I syllabi. 

Suspicion among the faculty is that when the $283 is-gone, the cost of duplicating 
may have to come out of their own pockets. 

"I won't pay for that and it's not the money (that is the issue), I think Ihal's 
wrong and it communicates the wrong message," Steve Hollander, an assistant 
professor of English, said. "Those are the kind of expenses the university should 
bear. Anyone who chooses lo do his own stuff, that's fine. People who are told ihey 
are going lo do something, that's something else " 

Hollander said he does not often use the department's duplicating and ditto 
machines, since he has a word processor and prefers to use thai and his own paper 
lo produce materials for his students. He said his average duplicating bill would 
run under SIO. 

"It (Ihe money for duplicating, phone calls, etc,) can come out of their own 
pocket, in which case it's tax deductible," Otten said. "It's really a matter of 
restriction, not prohibition, for the faculty members," 

"It's an attempt to control, rather than an attempt to prohibit," Otten said. 
"We're asking faculty members (o rethink their spending." He noted how an in- 
structor could use an overhead projector in class, at a cost of about five cenls. 
rather than duplicating the material for a class of about 22 students, which could 
cost anywhere from 16 cents to 20 cents. ' 

"It's obvious we're going lo go into debt," Otten said. "I'm trying lo keep down 
the size of Ihe debt." 

IPFW alumnus finds 
association rewarding 

ByJULIEMAGSAMEN 
Staff Writer 

When Gary Jefep came lo IPFW 
from Huntington Beach High School, 
L.A. California, he wasn't sure how he 
would adjust to the farmland in In- 
diana. Since then, Jerep, graduating in 
1980 with a B.S. in Math Computer 
Science, has learned lo enjoy Ihe 
beautiful, rolling countryside and 
friendly people of Indiana. 

Jerep obtained his master's degree 
in malhin 1985 while employed al North 
American Van Lines. Manager of 
Operations Research High Value 
Products, Jerep finds his math 
background very useful, "Majoring in a 
discipline of science helps a person to 
structure an analytical mind. Math is a 
very demanding science. You have lo 
have structure," Jerep said. 

When Jerep firsl started al North 
American Van Lines five years ago, he 
held the position of Information 
Systems Analyst. He was pleased when 
he switched lo his current position 
because he could use his mathematical 
abilities daily. 

Obtaining his degree was just a small 
part of Jerep's education at IPFW. In 
working toward his goal, he learned a 
lot about himself. "When I was in high 
school, I knew I wanted to follow math 
as a career. What I didn't realize was 
how much work was involved. To keep 
up, I had to work very hard. I had to be 
persistant and pushed myself to the 
limit. Thai's when you find out about 
yourself. You learn your strengths and 
weaknesses. How far you can go 
depends totally on you," Jerep said. 

Being a member of the IPFW Alumni 
Association has given Gary a great deal 
of satisfaction. He feels that he is giving 
back something of what he took while 
attending IPFW. Jerep, working wilh 
Ihe Alumni Association, is trying to 
improve the image of IPFW as a 
com muler college. Because students do 
not live on campus, they might think 




Gary Jerep 
IPFW alumnus 

that (hey are no! involved in the 
campus. However, the Alumni 
Association is fighting thai idea by 
getting studenls Involved in all types of 
extracurricular activities from the pep 
t)and lo continuing education, Jerep 
said. 

"Getting students involved in campus 
is very rewarding. You feel that you ar« 
connected willi the university. The 
more Ihe studenls make the campus 
grow through involvement, the more 
the university can contribute lo the 
growth ol the student," Jerep said, 

Jerep is currently taking a computer 
science class, while also leaching part- 
lime. "Nol bolh in the same semester, 
though; thai would be a little too 
much," Jerep said. 

Keeping in shape is one of Gary's 
hobbies. Last ycarhe logged 1600 miles 
louring the Indiana countryside on his 
bicycle. He also plays tennis an 
average of three times a week and 
admits being above average on the 
basketball court. "I'm not an all 
technical person," Jerep said.

Coaching quality pitiful; 
selertive search needed 



Head coach positions for bolh Ihe 
IPFW men's and women's basketball 
teams recently became available as Tim 
Russell was fir^ and Julie Calahan 
resigned after her second season at the 
helm 

Hopefully, with the slate wiped clean, 
the department will bring in talented 
coaches who can not only relate to their 
players but also project a positive 
attitude toward the public, unlike that 
projected by Ihe acrimonious former 
coach Tim Russell. 

U is quite sad Ihal a school with two 
outstanding, nationally-ranked. Division 
1 vollevball teams can produce such a 
pitiful 'Division 11 basketball program 
that constantly dangles in a state of 
restless oblivion. 

There is no legitimate excuse for the 
two teams combined record of 13-42, an 
embarrassing mark for not only those 
direclly involved but for the entire 
student body as well. 



With the immense pool of high school 
laleni in and around the Fort Wayne 
area, one would think that more recruits 
could be convinced to stay at or near 
home to play for the Mastodons. 
Although we're quite obviously not going 
to get the lop-notch Division I caliber 
athletes, there are still many others 
willing to play Division II 
Unfortunately, too many are being lured 
away from home. 

Arnie Ball, who coaches both 
volleyball teams while also serving 
as acting Athletic Director, would do 
well to appoint coaches with methods 
similar to his own Ball's remarkable 
coaching credentials are endless, but the 
simple fad remains he knows his game 
and what it lakes to coach successfully. 

It certainly would be nice to have a 
basketball program to complement the 
volleyball program. With a tew simple 
measures, that could be entirely 
feasible. 



Avoid hot summer sun 
spend the day in class 



spring semester is almost over and 
many students have no idea what 
they are going to do over summer 
break. Work is so blase, loafing around 
isn't very productive and there just isn't 
a whole lot else to do. But wait, there is 
something else to do. For those who 
can't get enough education during the 
regular school year there are summer 
courses. 

Summer courses? Who wants to spend 
their summer in schooH Why would 
anyone give up their vacation for .. gulp 
,.. education' 

There are several reasons people 
choose to take summer classes. One 
reason is simply time The more credits 
you can fit into a year the faster you'll 
graduate, and the faster you'll get into 
the "real world." 

Another reason is that summer classes 
go so quickly. What normally takes 



sixteen weeks takes only six. If you are 
required to take a class you dislike, 
you're better off taking it during the 
summer to get it over with quicker 

A better reason is to keep from 
working at some menial labor all 
summer Most classes are scheduled 
during the day, most summer jobs are 
during the day. Wouldn't you rather sit 
in a nice air-conditioned room than 
sweat it out in the boring Indiana sun? 

There are a few drawbacks, however 
Taking winter classes and summer 
classes means you're studying pretty 
much year round. Also it's hard to get a 
tan from the inside of a classroom. The 
benefits, however, outweigh the 
disadvantages. You complete school 
faster and get through tougher classes 
faster and avoid working during the 
summer months 




'Boilermakers' opens at IPFW 



Fire on tap in Indiana- 
legislation needed soon 



Many people are aware of the 
traditional environmental concerns 
associated with landfilling or the 
disposal of wastes. Bui until recently, 
there has been less attention to the 
potential for environmental problems 
associated with the storage of products, 
especially in underground tanks. 

Commentary 

Can you imagine going to your faucet 
to gel a glass of water, but instead of 
water you gel a stream of flames 
because your tap water has ignited? 

Or while washing your clothes, yout- 
washing machine catches on fire 
because the machine was actually using 
a weak gasoline solution instead of pure 
water? 

These incidents actually happened in a 
small central Indiana community where 
underground gasoline tanks at a local 
gas station were leaking and 
contaminatmg the underground water 
supply in the area 

There are currently over 30,000 
underground tanks in Indiana which 
store gasoline and hazardous industrial 
chemicals, and the potential threat of 
similar incidents occurring is 
tremendous. Officials from the State 
Board of Health say gasoline could 
remain in the contaminated water 
supply for a period of up to 30 years. 

As Chairman of the Indiana House of 
Representatives' Environmental Affairs 
Committee, I have introduced 
legislation which immediately 
addresses this dangerous situation. This 
measure (House Bill 1734) establishes 
the framework for a state underground 
storage lank program which is 
comparable to the federal program 
created in 1984, 



The state's passage of this bill should 
enhance Indiana's ability to obtain 

federal funding for this program. The 
environmental Protection Agency has 
indicated that federal allocations to 
states will be based upon EPA's 
perception as to which states are most 
capable of immediate implementation 
and use of the funding. 

House Bill 1734 has essentially the 
same following four objectives the 
federal program entails: 

1) The identification of underground 
tanks, 

2) The prevention of leaks from tanks, 

3) Draft measure to detect leaks from 
tanks. 

4) Draft measure to correct problems 
when leaks occur. 

Indiana citizens are highly dependent 
on groundwater as a source of drinking 
water. Therefore, it is vital that we take 
steps to prevent contaminated water. 

Indiana has been a leader in 
controlling the pollution of our 
environment. We need to keep this 
reputation by continually trying to solve 
environmental questions. 

House Bill 1734 has passed the House 
and committee stage in the Senate, 
where it is currently waiting for Second 
Reading. 

Editor's Note: Representative 
Richard Mangus, a Lakeville 
Republican, is the author of the program 
to deal with the problems of leaking 
underground storage tanks, A farmer by 
profession. Mangus has been the 
chairman of the House Environmental 
Affairs Committee for the past six years, 
Mangus was first elected to the House of 
Representatives in 1972, and has served 
continuously in the General Assembly 
since that time.

Gibson goes for gunslinging; Allen goes for the Golden Age 



ByKKHARDE. 

JOHNSON 

Staff Writer 

A major fact Ihat renders 

•■Lethal Weapon" un- 



Review 



believable is thai its two 
main characters, a young 
cop and an old cop, are 
played by Mel Gibson iMad 
Max I and Danny Glover 



(Witness, The Color Purplei 
who are virtually the same 
age, 

"Lethal Weapon" opened 
a few weeks ago at the 
Holiday in Northcrest and is 
slill playing (here. 

"Lethal Weapon's" 
timespan is from Glover's 
50th birthday, two days 
before Christmas, lo 
Chrislmas night. An 
amazingly large amount of 
action takes place in three 
days After a slow start with 



the audience wondering 
what anything has lo do with 
anything else, the slory 
breaks into a plot with neato 
Miami Vice gunplay, old 
Vietnam Special Force ex- 
ClA hereoine smugglers 
complete with hostage crisis 
and removed war sym- 
pathies 

The film has few 
redeeming qualities. FirsI, 
the action at the end makes 
one forget that he was bored 
to tears at the beginning and 



(he hostage. Glover's on- 
screen daughter is played by 
a young- but-stunning Traci 
Wolfe. This is her first film 
but I — and I'm sure others 
whose jaw dropped at the 
likes of Rae Dawn Chong 
(Color Purple. Soul Man. 
Commandoi or Lisa Bonet 
(Angel Heart, The Cosby 
Show 1 — am looking forward 
lo her appearances in future 
projects. 

Finally, I wasn't sure if I 
really wanted to report to the 



IPFW student body thai 
"Lethal Weapon" was a 
nol-so-greal movie, so I 
saw Woody Allen's "Radio 
Days" too .., which was 
letter 

It's hard to believe that 
"Lethal Weapon" and 
"Radio Days" are in the 
same medium. A quick 
comparison ol the two 
movies shows the vast ex- 
tremes of films being made 
today. 



"Radio Days," pla&gt;ing al

Windows to the soul are found in many colors 



ylLENE SMITH 
Staff Writer 

Since ancient limes, the 
eyes have been considered 
the windows to the soul. 

Uur language certainly 
shows our culture's ob- 
session with eyes — beautiful 
women hove "bedroom 
eyes." an alerl individual 
may have "sharp eyes." and 
handsome men have 
"dreamy eyes," Is it any 
wonder so much allention is 
paid to them',' The eye is 
more than an organ of vision. 
Eyes are the subconscious 
Iransmiltera o( messages, 
ranging from the subtle to 



the extreme They show 
expression, betray moods, 
and reveal the personalities 
ol their owners. 

Yet not all thai the eyes 
say are of a subconscious 
nature Women have had ihe 
corner on eye-talk for ages 
Just open any magazine 
like "Vogue" or 

■Cosmopolitan." and you 
areboundlofindhalfa dozen 
ads for eye makeup. There is 
mascara lor long lashes and 
a ■'wide eyes innocent look," 
and an array of eye shadows 
for looks thai range from 
soplusticated to sultry 



Makeup IS not the only way 
lo add beauty to one's eyes. 
Contact lenses can help as 
well. For years tinted lenses 
have been available There 
are a number ol tmled lenses 
available on the market 
today, as June Gomez of 
Royal Optical explained. The 
lenses can be found in a wide 
variety of tints, and cost 
around $80 a pair. They can 
be used to enhance one's 
nautral eye color, making 
blue eyes bluer, or green 
eyes greener. If a person is 
lucky enough to have 
ralurally light colored eyes. 



linled contact lenses can 
even change their eye color. 

Until recently, dark-eyed 
people could no! change their 
eye color. According to an 
employee ol Pearle Vision, 
this IS no longer the case. 
Tinted lenses have become 
available locally within the 
past year that can even 
change dark brown eyes to a 
natural looking blue. These 
new lenses are sofl lenses, 
and last about us long as

Krocker and pitcher Matt

McGuire does fair in final picks of the year 



it's been a great weekend

there's one thing I want lo 
gel off my chesl: We can't 
have powerhouses playing at

I believe, at last count, 
that DePaulhasi09winsand 
nine losses at their Zepplin 
Hanger on Ihe landing 
pattern to O'Hare. So how 
would you like lo be a coach 
who's worked all year, and 
had thedreamof going to the 
NCAA, and then end up 
playing either of those 
schools at either of those 
respeclive places, and have 
people trying lo tell you that 
it's a neutral court? 

If you stop and think alwut 
it, it'd be so easy for the 
NCAA lo get around that 
problem.

At the Horizon, you could 
have the winner of Ihe Big 
10, Notre Dame, the Mid- 
American winner, and the 
Missouri Valley winner — 
which would guarantee 
selling the place out. And it's 
the same up in Syracuse

just not right. 

I also think ;hat the 
regionals should be at 
permanent sites — a city 
that has adequate hotels, a 
modern airport, and an 
arena that's been built in the 
last 15 years. And, I think the 
finals should be kept moving 
around the country as they 
are now. And seeing as we're 
trying lo improve the NCAA 
tournament, since it's not 
broke. I think next year we 
should do the right thing and 
divide the Sio million bet- 
ween all 290 Division I 
schools 

Now, that we've got all 
that off our chest, let's gel 
into Ihe EliieEight. 

In East Rutherford. N.J., 
Notre Dame will try to stay 
to a stow-down pattern, with 
multiple faces on defense lo 
keep the clock running. They 
need a big, big game out of 
Donald Royal, and their 
baseline must play above its 
ability. The Tar Heels of 
North Carolina could be

keyed too high — because of 
the revenge factor generated 
from thai loss at Soulh Bend 
during the season. Look for 
them to alternate three 
freshmen on David Rivers to 
wear him down, and they'll 
also get too many simple 
put-backs down on the 
blocks. In conclusion, the 
Tar Heels NBA baseline to 
win big over the lack-of-l)eef 
baseline of the Gold and 
Blue 

In the other Jersey game, I 
look for Rony Seikaly to 
neutralize the 7-fool 2-inch 
freshman from Florida in 
the painl. and Sherman 
Douglas to match up with 
any of the Florida 
powerhouse of guards. But 
the difference will be the 
forward position — and I 
look tor Syracuse to break 
their jinx in the NCAA and 
continue to move along, even 
though Norm Sloan won it in 
I974. when he heal a good 
Marquette team coached by. 



I hope, you know who. 

Now, into Ihe Southeast 
Regional' Let's look Tirst at 
Georgetown and Kansas. 
The coaches are equal, both 
giants, both Wilt Cham- 
berlains in their professions, 
and both go by their first, 
names, John and Larry. 

What we also have 
showcased here are con- 
sensus Ail-Americans in 
Danny Manning and Reggie 
Williams, though they just 
happen to be in different 
positions. Both benches are 
long, but I look for the 
Jayhawks to win because the 
Hoyas have developed a 
dangerous habit — letting 
clubs gel too far in front of 
them loo early in the game. 

In the bottom half of that 
regional, which is being

great athletes. The 
Providence Club will be led 
by Ihe 6-foot Donovan, who 
reminds me of Michigan 
State's Scott Skiles, but the 
clock will strike 12 for this 
Cinderella leam, and the 
Crimson Tide will roll. 

Now we go to the Midwest 
— Indiana against Duke. 
Here, the Master will lake on 
his star pupil, and look for 
Tommy Amaker to sIod 
Sieve Alford — but this will 
effect him in trying to run 
the offense on the other end 
of the court. Duke's aone 
won't work because Keith 
Smart is also 3-point 
oriented. It the refs blow a 
slow whistle, it'll become a 
physical game and the 
Hoosiers will move on. 

In the bottom half, look for 
DePaul's Blue Demons, who 
won in a miracle against St. 
John's last week, to not get 
caught in a slow-dosvn game 
by LSU, to use more ef- 
fectively Dallas Cbmegy's, a 
true All-American, and for 
the new Mr. March, Dale 
Brown, to be positive and 
motivating. Bui he needs an 
outstantling game from both 
Wilsons — Nikita and 
Anthony — and so it looks to 
me like the Blue Demons will 
have learned their lesson 
and will continue on to the 
Regional Finals 

Finally, now moving like 
the sun across the country to 
the West, 1 first see UPrt-V 
vs. Wyoming. True, Dembo 
is a star, and Leckner is the 
franchise, and the Cowpokes 
have the enthusiasm, but the 
Running Rebels have too 
much Firepower, Like 
Freddie Banks and Armon 
Gilliam, and Tark the Shark 
losmell blood: It'll be UNLV 
big. 

And in the last one to call, 
Iowa vs. Oklahoma, I see the 
point guard to be a problem 
for the Sooners, w'ho I think 
will be strong oft the of- 
fensive board. But Iowa will 
throw too many defensive 
faces at them, and the 10- 
man rotation will create toul 
problems. So look for the 
Hawkeyes to continue their 
flight to Ihe delta. 

Now, admittedly, these 
are not easy picks, gang. I'm

but remember that anyone 
who gets to the Sweet 16 is 
good, or they wouldn't be 
there in the first place. 

Invariably, games are 
decided in the first three 
minutes and the last three 
minutes, but be aware, in a 
lot of games, the key three 
minutes are Ihe starting 
three minutes of the second 
half — and that's a lip from 
the top. 

See you next week, as we 
get down to the Creole and 
Cajun foods, and where the 
Checkeree cottee is stronger 
than 110 percent bourbon.
