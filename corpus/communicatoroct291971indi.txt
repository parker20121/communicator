Day Care Study Committee tours lU at 
South Bend to initiate action on project 



Fort Wayne members of the 
Day Care Study Committee tra- 
veled to lU Regional at South 
Bend (lUSB) last Friday on a 
fact finding tour of their 
facilities. 

The group spent the day 
in discussions with adminis- 
trators of the day care pro- 
gram. Their efforts were to 
detercine the feasibility of 
establishing similar facili- 
ties here. 

Members of the committee 
headed by ass't Dean, John P. 
Ulmer included Nan O'Comiell, 
Clara Wright, harty Martinez 
and former Students* Govern- 
ment President, Scott Gillie, 

They were hosted by Mr. 
Robert Dubick, new lUSB Dir- 
ector of Student Activities. 



Students' Government Presi- 
dent, Mark Pranke recently ap- 
roached the administration 
with a recommendation for an 
investigation to determine 
the need for^ and feasibility 
of establishing a day-care 
center here. 

It is felt that preli- 
minary investigation will 
establish a -definite need 
for such a service. 

The committee was formed 
to conduct preliminary in- 
vestigation. Interested mem- 
bers of the student body, fac- 
ulty, or administration should 
contact committee members or 
leave name, address and phone 
number in the Communicator 
office directed to Marty 
Martinez. 



APO and Circle K complete used book drive 



Paul Little becomes 
new Bookstore manager, 
James Guseman transfers 

Jajoes Guseman, majiafer of 
the bookstore for the past 
one and a half years is "oine 
to Champaigne, Illinois to 
manage the Follette bookstore 
at the University of Illinois. 

The new manager is Paul 
Little. Mr. Little was a 
textbook department managcer 
for Curry's bookstore at lU, 
Bloomington for seven years. 

Guseman feels that the 
services of the lU-PU book- 
store have been upgraded in 
the past few years, and is 
reluctant to leave because, 
he says "This is a freat store 
and iny affiliation with the 
students and faculty has been 
a great experience. The 
bookstore is growing and I 
would like to be a part of 
that growth, " 



Members of AlO end Circle 
K completed a book drive at 
lU-rU last week by collecting 
over ^00 used college books 
to supplement the lendleton 
Prison Library. 

Cne of the main contribut- 
ers to the drive was the Ind- 
iana-Purdue Bookstore. 

The bookstore supplied the 
groups with approximately 150 
used school books. 

Nearly 500 books were col- 
lected at the book drop at the 



Circle K coat room. 

The concept of this pro- 
ject originated from a stu- 
dent not connected with either 
organization but who believed 
that this type of project was 
a worthwhile one. This stu- 
dent. Miss Carol Hooker, 
sought the help of these two 
service oriented groups. 

Anyone with suggestions 
for worthwhile projects should 
contact one of their members.

Reply lo JefT Gibson 

Dear Plr, Gibson: 

I would like to take the 
time to represent most of 
the mature student body in 
saying a few words to you: 
you're crazyi 

And we've heard enough 
from you and people like you — 
you're all nuts. 

We're tired of being told 
that we need an ideal. We're 
tired of being told that we 
need to choose; indeed, you 
say we can't escape choosing. 

Well, we are not going to 
choose; indeed, you say we 
can't escape choosing. Well, 
we are going to choose not 
to choose. 

We are totally committed 
to not becoming totally com- 
mitted. And you say there's 
a convictionj Where? 

Why should we become in- 
volved in life when we can 
play bridge in the cafeteria 
and study computer program- 
ming? Why should we feel? 

That only gets in the 
way of our security and self- 
image. You want us to work 
for dignity and justice; but 
I say that dignity and jus- 
tice exist only if we allow 
such perverse concepts to 
invade our thinking. 

Why should we? We're 
only hximan beings. And why 
fight for a cause of love 
and truth? 

We're not affected by 
hate, prejudice, and wars — 
unless of course we're 
drafted (ah, but that's only 
for two years,) Why should 
we care? 

I say, "Teach your chil- 
dren to love their neighbor, 
but make" damn sure they grow 
up." 

Hurting, caring, feeling — 
all such concepts can do to 
us is make us human. But that 
in itself is dangerous. We're 
comfortable where we are. 

Why should we exercise 
our freedom when we can let 
others do the work for us? 
We can be molded by social 
pressures, and then be conZ" 
pressures, and then be con- 
vinced that our reactions 
are natural. 

Why do you want to rep- 
resent us? We're happy 
being machines. 

Jeff, you're crazy to 
try to be a man when the 
state wants us all to be 
machines. 

You're insane when you 
say that one can't love 
someone by killing him. 

You are a troublemaker, 
trying to upset our status 
quo. Ho, Jeff, we enjoy 
our slavery to nothingness, 
— A Student, 
Mike Ellis

With different approach 



Adult basic education explored 



In the U.S. over 60 mil- 
lion adults have less than 
a high school education. In 
Indiana alone over 55,956 
people are reading below the 
6"" grade level, and 868,000 
have not had any hif^h school 
education. Fort Wayne has 
over ^0,000 adults who are 
functioning below the 8ib grade 
level, and this number is 
increasing every month. 

What is being done about 
this situation^ Who is doing 
the job? How well is the 
task being done? How can 
others help? 

John Hatfield, the Coordin- 
ator of Special Projects for 
the Fort Wayne Comniunity 
Schools, has a vision which 
has seen Adult Basic Educa- 
tion classes spread from a 
small program of 250 people 
to over 1,600 in 1971. 

Afternoon and evening class- 
es are presently beinp: con- 
ducted at numerous locations 
throughout the city. 

At these places John 
Hatfield has adopted the ex- 
perimentalist philosophy, - 
actually practicing John • 
Dewey's ideas. No teacher 
stands up and teaches the 
whole class. 

Each adult finds himself 
or herself working at the le- 
vel which leads to success- 
ful performance. Each per- 
son advances independently 
under the suggestion and 
guidance of an educational 
coordinator. 



Individual counseling along 
with coffee provides for a 
special prescription for each 
adult, identifying both short 
and long term goals. 

A great deal of help is 
needed with the program. 
Most Adult Basic Education 
teachers have had little or 
no help from colleges and uni- 
versities in learning how to 
teach reading to adults at 
the nitty-gritty level, 

riore volunteer helpers 
are needed on a one to one 
relationship, Hohn Hatfield 
feels that the instructor must 
first be a friend before he 
can teach adults at this le- 
vel. 

More research is needed 
to develop materials of an 
adult interest level. Clos- 
er contact must be kept with 
adults who stop coming to 
class. 




Jotm Katfield and Pane 
Hein c:iscuss mutual 
goals, 

The yearly withdrawal rate 
is over 50%, and the staff 
is inadequate to follow 
through helping adults who 
have multiple problems often 
compounded by poor health, 
poor housing, broken families, 
under-employment , language 
barriers, unemployment, fin- 
ancial burdens, and even a 
lack of friends or responsi- 
ble persons to encourage them 
to keep trying. 

This cycle of desperation 
can be broken, but more inter- 
ested persons are needed. If 
you can help contact John 
Hatfield at 7^5-6^2

Honors Interns 
gain experience 

Approximately fifteen stu- 
dents are enrolled in S499 
but never have a class ; they 
never take an exam. 

A dream course? Ko. These 
students are participating in 
the Internship Program coordin- 
ated by Fane Hein. 

Students eligible must be 
juniors or seniors, have a B 
average and be prepared to 
work in a social service agency 
60 hours during the semester, 
averaging 5 hrs. a week. 

During the 2nd and 5rd 
weeks of the semester students 
are placed in a position at 
an agency as close as possible 
to their field of interest. 

By working in the program, 
a participant may be involv- 
3d in casework or administra- 
tion. 

This field experience may 
take place in planning agenc- 
ies, centers for delinquents, 
preschool and Headstart pro- 
grams, legal services agency 
in the Office of Economic. 
Opportimity, or Urban League. 

Other opportunities in- 
clude work at the State 
School and Family service 
Agencies, both public and 
private. 

The upperclassmen part- 
icipating in the Honors pro- 
gram at thie time include 
sociolo?;y and psychology 
majors, students in educa- 
tion with an endorsement in 
one of the social sciences. 

They may accuriulate up to 
12 hours in the Honors Sem- 
inar of Field experience, 
Eeactions to the program, now 
two years old, note the flex- 
ibility of the hours and the 
varied needs of the arencies 
in which the students are 
placed.

IWL supports 
Fox Island plan 
for county park 

Alpha Chapter of the Izaak 
//alton Lea^e, consisting of 
lU-rU students here, has an- 
nounced that it wishes to go 
on record as wholeheartedly 
supporting the Allen County- 
Park Board. 

The board is making ef- 
forts to acquire the Fox 
Island area as first in a 
hoped-for series of parks 
in Allen County. 

Support is based on the 
generous size of the pro- 
perty, its proximity to the 
center of highest population 
in the county; and its suit- 
ability for iDUltiple react- 
ional uses. 

The land is known for its 
value as both an ecological 
unit, and a geological or 
botanical lEuseum. The land 
included in the original pro- 
posal also provides fringe 
areas suitable for more con- 
ventional park uses such as 
picnic, ball-park, tennis, 
horseshoe, and sanitary facil- 
ities. 

In the opinion of Alpha 
Chapter of the Izaak Walton 
League, this type of park 
seems to be the proto-type 
of the park of the future. 
Fewer and fewer natural aj?eas, 
with or without special geo- 
lop-ical, botanical, or other 
features, will be left for 
the enjoyment of our increas- 
ingly urban population.

Switchboard responds to 38,000 
calls in first year of service 



Having responded to more 
than 38,000 telephone requests 
for assistnace since June 24^ 
1970, Switchboard, Inc., a 
referral agency, is actively 
involved in attempting to 
define and alleviate many of 
the difficllt situations 
which have confronted Fort 
Wayne residents. 

Switchboard, Inc. is a 
not-for-profit corporation 
organized under the laws of 
the State of Indiana on Feb. 
11, 1970, and all donations 
to the organization are tax- 
deductable. 

The financing of the organ- 
ization is accomplished most- 
ly by personal donations, 
and it is the job of the 
Board of Directors to ensure 
adequate funding. 

The board consists of 2 
lawyers, 3 social workers, 
5 college students, a Catho- 
lic priest, a local Lutheran 
leader, a Doctor of psycho- 
logy, and a local businessman. 

Additionally, the board is 
responsible for determining 
the direction and policy of 
Switchboard, Inc. 

The most important part of 
the operation, however, are 
the volunteer operators who 
give their time to make Switch- 
board a working idea, for 
when someone calls Switch- 
board at 7^2-7355 these vol- 
unteers are the ones who re- 
spond to the problem in any 
way they can. And they will 
readily admit that the success 
of Switchboard has been due 
to the individual response 
given to each call, for they 
never lose sight of the fact 
that the caller is not just 



a voice on the phone, but r 
rather a person with a pro- 
blem. 

Switchboard is always in 
need of volunteers to be 
trained for phone service as 
well as financial assistance 
of any kind. 

Anyone wishing to help is 
encouraged to contact Switch- 
board at any time during the 
day or night.

Samuel Beckett's "Endgame" 
opens PIT'S second production 
or the 1971-72 season tonight. 
'Endgame seems to violate all 
laws of fiction writing, yet 
manages to portray a most vivid 
impression of life at its very 
essence. 

Conventional authors met- 
iculously construct their 
characters to form an ideal 
they try to project and force 
onto the audience. 

Beckett meticulously des- 
tructs his characters until his 
fictitious world "becomes so 
incongruous, so unrealistic, so 
chaotic that the audience feels 
it should impose itself onto 
the play. 

In fact, in an earlier play, 
Beckett went so far as to write 
in a "member" of the audience 
to climb onto the stage and 
argue with the cast to go ahead 
and bring the play to a close. 
In "Endgame," the play does 
draw to a close — almost exactly 
where it began. 

The Cartesian philosophy of 
Descartes is called to mind by 
"Endgame," but, unlike Descartes' 
conclusion that God's existence 
is affirmed through doubting 
everything, Beckett's characters 
draw no such conclusion. 

In fact, "Endgame" says nothing 
does nothing, proves nothing, and 
concludes nothing: but then again, 
does life? Beckett makes the 
viewer consider that question, 

"Endgame" is an algebraic 
equation plotted on a-J-axis 
Cartesian coordinate system. 
Its players carefully maintain 
their positions at the origin, 
"zero, by zero, by zero." 

"Endgame" is the final moves 
of a chessgame where only a 
vulnerable Red King remains 
attended by an almost useless 
Red Knight. He is constantly 
harassed by two White Pawns 
who are close enough to ir- 
ritate, yet are more comfort 
than threat. 

Constantly warning that he 
will leave the King, the Knight 
is never able to go imtil a 
potential "danger causes him 
to prepare himself for de- 
parture. The pawns exist 
at the whim of the King. 

"Endgame" is an analogy 
wherein the "hamner" (Hamm) 
manipulates the three more 
passive "nails," Clov, Nacg, 
and Nell. 

' EndgEime" is a commentary 
on the dualism of man caught 
in the conflict between his 
body and his mind. The two 

6 



are constantly at odds with 
each other, yet inseparable — 
Hamm and Clove, Nagg and 
Nell. 

"Endgame" is all of these 
and more, or should I say 
less? "Endgame" is a mighty 
challenge for Director Dan 

Cashman and, if he succeeds, 
the play will be very, very 
good; but if he fails, the 
play will"be very, very bad,

Politicians visit 
I-PU campus 

As Election Day draws 
nearer, city office-seekers 
become more common on campus. 
Two of the most recent visit- 
ors were City Clerk Fuad G, 
Bonahoom and Councilman-at- 
large Ed Rousseau 

Both are campaigning for 
re-election on the Republican 
ticket. Bonahoom and Rousseau 
made stops at the Communica- 
tor office where they answ- 
ered questions concerning 
their office duties and plans 
for the next term. 

Sporting Zeis buttons, 
the Republican candidates 
also visited other parts of 
the campus shaking hands and 
talking with the newly in- 
franchised voters.

leff Gibson, second commentary 



Last week, Jeff Gibson's 
decision to resist the draft 
was considered in terms of 
military conscription as a 
confiscation of a man's life 
by the state. 

This week's discussion 
will center around two assump- 
tions which Gibson feels are 
endemic to the concept of 
military conscription: as- 
sumptions which are in vio- 
lation of the Declaration of 
Independence, 

The section of the Declara- 
tion most relevant to the 
issue reads as follows: "We 
hold these truths to be self- 
evident, that all men are 
created equal, that they are 
endowed by their creator with 
certain unalienable rifrhts, 
that among these are life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. That to secure 
these rights, governments are 
instituted among men, deriv- 
ing their 0"S't powers from 
the consent of the governed." 

Most basic to the assump- 
tions of military conscrip- 
tion, according to Gibson, 
is that the state usurps the 
rights of an individual and 
confiscates his life for its 
own purposes. 

Confiscation is effected 
even if the individual sur- 
vives his term of service be- 
cause of conditioning impos- 
ed by the military system, 

I^om the first day of re- 
cruit training, Gibson be- 
lieves that the individual 
is molded into an instrument 
of the state by a process 
which results in a deprecia- 
tion of self-esteem, reduction 
to a state of suggestibility, 
identification with military 
authorities, and acceptance 
of arbitrarj' authority — all 
within an atmosphere domi- 
nated by fear. 

He feels the result is 
a person in whom the quali- 
ties of tolerance, hxunane- 
ness, imagination, and bro- 
therhood are stifled. 

When he leaves active duty, 
the veteran's instinct is to 
justify a system and process 
that has taken years out of 
his life to avoid the intol- 
erable thought that his time 
was wasted. 

He has been conditioned 
into seeing himself as a de- 
pendent cog in a giant mach- 
ine. He is programmed to re- 
spond to authoritarianism of 
almost any form from almost 
any source. 

The individual who is not 
drafted is still within the 
power of the state. The state 
interprets this power, accord- 
ing to Gibson, as the right 
to define the identity of that 
individual. "If the state 
owns us, it can also tell us 
who we are to be. We are 
given draft cards to teach us 
a way of looking at ourselves." 
October 29, 1971 



The main support for 
Gibson's conclusions, regard- 
ing the role definition of 
an individual by the state, is 
a document entitled "Channel- 
linfc," which was issued by 
the Selective Service System 
in July of 1955. 

The Orientation Kit, of 
which "Channeling" was a part, 
was recalled when it fell in- 
to "unauthorized hands," but 
it has never h«en rescinded.

Intramural teams face rivals Sun. 



by Tom Penzone 

This Sunday the gridiron 
will be on fire as the Posse 
aiid Aschbacker blaze into 
battle. 

Both teams have flooded 
the vin column. This season 
marks their third consecutive 
year of rivalry at I-PU, 
Neither squad has had a loss 
and both plan to leave the 
field victorious this week- 
end. 

Most cafeteria quarter- 
backs are favoring the Posse 
by two or three T.D. 's but 
this writer's prediction is 
a bit more conservative, giv- 
ing the Posse a 6 point ad- 
vantage. 

Last Sunday the Train 
whistled into tlie second di- 
vision lead as they stopped 
Woolems in a thriller. 
Woolems held the lead, 12-6 
with less than a minute re- 
maining. But the boxcars 
weren't to be denied. They 
called a time-out and turned 
to their playmaker Dietz. 

Dietz oiled some wheels 
and engineered a T.D. pass 
play to Kick Lad for a 12-12 
tie. 

That wasn't the Train's 
last stop however, as Perry 
Erstman&gt; on another pass play, 
went over for the conversion 
and a 15-12 win. 

Hoehn-Roy packed up their 
third win as they fought to 
a 13-0 victory over Cook. 

H-R scored on two long 
passes from Stiffler to Roy 
but neither squad was able to 
generate much in the way of 
gains on the ground. 

Both teams' defensive units 
turned in strong performances 
and the battle was nip and 
tuck throughout the contest. 

Ambrose blasted the Beav- 



ers 48-0. Tom Fabian tallied 
for four T.D.s. 

Scott Evans, Kerry Ambrose 
and Gary Hilger each added 6 
to Fabian's tallies and the 
Beavers retrested with anoth- 
er loss. 

The girls are not yet 
throwing in their towels as 
they are preparing for that 
super battle with the Nads in 
a few weeks. 

The Nads pulled through 
with another easy win as Wal- 
ters-Evarts failed to show 
for the contest. Aschbacher 
also picked up a forfiet over 
KcMahon. 

Heed-Perry chalked up 
three T.D.s and an extra 
.point in their 19-0 win over 
the Greasers. 

The Posse, in one of the 
losest scoring games of their 
campaign, handed Farrell a 
19-6 loss. 

The Posse held Farrell 's 
squad scoreless until late 
in the game when Joe Farrell 
clamped onto a pass from 
his quarterback and slipped 
into the end-zone. 

This writer has been in- 
formed that John William's, 
Posse center, is requesting 
all Posse half-backs to com- 
plete a 500 word disertation 
entitled, "How to follow your 
blockers, " 

This Sunday's action deve- 
lops as follows: 
North Field 

ik-.^Q Fosse vs Aschbacher 
1:^5 Ambrose vs Heed-Perry 
5:00 Greasers vs Farrell 
4:15 McKahon vs Beavers

1:45 Train vs Valters-Evarts 
5:00 Krause vs Woolems 
4:15 Hoehn-Eoy vs Nads 



Mastodons topple 
OSU kickers 

Looking for revenge after 
their loss to Indiana-Purdue 
in an earlier Mastodon home 
game, Ohio State University 
of Lima again supred the cup 
of defeat. They were served 
by the dynajnic Mastodon squad 
in a Saturday game on buckeye 
soil. 

The Mastodons scored first 
on a fast break play with 
Greg Yager popping the ball 
from the grasp of the O.b.U. 
goalie. Al Fleek added the 
finishing touches with a six 
yard goal, 

O.S.U. came back to even 
the score at the half. 

Action in the second half 
found Greg Yager scoring on 
a head in shot. 

After a long drive down 
field, Frank Hartman and 
Dick Burke, IP forward insid- 
es, helped get the ball to 
Steve Tobias. Tobias popped 
a shot into the Baron 'c net 
to up the score to 5-1- 

O.S.U. ajnassed two more 
goals to end their scoring. 
Al Fleek, in a one on one 
situation, faked out the 
goalie and put tt:e red and 
gold into the lead. 

The Mastodons stap-ed 
another attack and Greg Yager 
pumped the final goal of the 
game after a net mouth scram- 
ble. 

Coming November 6, at the 
St, Francis field, Indiana- 
Purdue is hosting the first 
annual Fort Wayne Intercolle- 
giate Soccer Tournament. IP 
will face 0,S,U., who were 
defeated twice this season 
by the Mastodons. 

Huntington will play St. 
Francis in the second game 
and the winners of the two 
bouts will play to receive 
the honors of the Tourney on 
the following day. 

The Mastodons have both 
defeated Huntington and lost 
to them this season, St. 
Francis has lost to Indiana- 
Purdue on several occasions, 
including the four-hour Soc- 
cer Marathon which establish- 
ed the Mastodons as World 
Record Holders. 

Also, as a special added 
attraction, the Indiana- 
Purdue Soccer Club would like 
to officially invite James 
Bollinger, athletic director 
at the extension, to be pre- 
sent to receive a trophy 
which was "purchased from 
surplus road trip money. " 

The November 6U) activity 
is free. 

Apology to Hetriek 

Apologies to Jerrj- Het- 
rick, Mastodon kicker. In 
a caption on last week's 
sport page, the COMIOJIIICATOR 
mistook him for John Baker.
