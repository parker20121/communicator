University ranks 
near bottom in 
state funding 



Out o( 17 Indiaru universities 

receive slate funding. IPFW 

ranks 14 in terms of state money 

[ler student, according lo the 
ndiana Commission for Higher 
Education. 

To help stale legislators get a 
betler feel for the needs ofstu- 
denls and lo raise more universi- 
ty funding, the IPFW Alumni 



Association is taking two bus- 
loads ol students and (acuity to 
the general assembly in 
Indianapolis on Wednesday, Feb. 
20, for a day o( lobbying. 

Students and (acuity who par- 
ticipate in the (ree trip will learn 
how and what lo lobby (or dur- 
mg special traming sessions pnj- 
vidca by the Alumni Association, 

Those at lending will then eat 
lunch with area legislators. The 
lunch. Bosk said, provides stu- 
dents and (acuity lime to chat 
with legislators. 

"We try lo be pomled in what 
we ask them (or,'' Bosk said. She 
expbined that IPFW is tiyuig to 
get more emiity (state funding 
on a per student basis) and tech- 



nology (undmg. 

Bosk said that the hinding 
dissonance between IPFW and 
other universities results from 
legislators' use o( a sel formula 
to determine equity funding. 

Some uruversities, however, 
have developed special needs 
criteria in order lo get more equi- 
ty funding. 

Bosk added thai 'some legis- 
lators in other parts o( the state 
have made higher education 
their number one goal." 

Bosk noted thai the result of 
harder lobbying and special 
needs criteria is that universities 
like lU Kokomo, with an enroll- 
ment of 1,751 (uU-time students, 
received MJ77 per student in 1999. 



In the same year. IPFW. with 
an enrollment of 6,6S3 students. 
received only S4J34— about 
S1.0(X) less per student. 

Bosk said that (or the last five 
years, the Alumru Association 
has been taking students to 
Indianapolis to lobby legislators. 

Over the years, the number of 
students has groism, she said. 
This year, more than 95 students 
will attend the tnp. 

"I think it has helped in mak- 
mg higher education a bigger 
priority in the rrunds o( our leg- 
islators," she said. 

The interaction between legis- 
lators and students, she added, is 
crucial because students arc who

This year. Indiana University 
IS using money raised by its 
famed Little 500 race, lo create 



each, will "memorialize those 
who lost their lives on Sept. 11," 
said Abby Quinnette. president 
of the lU Student Foundation. 

"They also honor the courage 
and commitment o( Americans, 
especially those directly affecled 
as they go forward in the ader- 
malh of that day." 

Three lU students whose 
fathers were killed in Ihe Sept. II 
terrorist attacks helped deter- 
mine the general criteria (or Ihe 
scholarships. 

The students, Rachel 
Jacobson, Josh Goldflam and 
Jessy Moskel, chose criteria (or 
the scholarships based on quali- 
ties found in their parents. 

The three sludenls. however, 
ivill not be the first recipients of 
the scholarships, 

Jacobson's father. Stephen, 
worked at WPIX on the 110th 
floor o( the North Tower ol the 
World Trade Center. 

"It's such an honor that 
Indiana has been so supportive 
throughout this rough time," 
said Jacobson, 

"To have something so posi- 
tive come out of something so 
ne^tivc is amazing." 

Specific details on recipient 
criteria (or Ihe scholarships will 
be announced in April. 

The scholarships will be 
awarded annually on Sept, 11 by 
the lU Student Foundation. 

The Little 500 race, held in 
late April each year, is expected 
to raise about S40,000, said 
Amtier Stafford, vice president 



of the lU Student Foundation. 

The money will go toward an 
endowment lo (und the 9/11 
Scholarships, 

Stafford said approximately 
560,000 would be needed to 
ensure that the lU Student 
Foundation could give out the 
scholarships each year. 

Future amounts given out in 
the scholarships will depeni 









Ihe endowment, said Stafford. 

The Foundation and lU are 
asking for donations to help 
raise more money for the fund.

Student-run 
radio station 
may be on 
air in 2003 

By Andrew Howanj, Staff Writer 

IPFW may have its own cam- 
pus radio station for students In 
the future. 

Plans are underivay for a 
group of IPFW students to create 
a student-run station as early as 
the spring ol 2003, 

Sophomore Matt Shilling is 
one of the students involved in 
the project. Shilling says the 
schcml once had a station about 
15 years ago. but it was shut 
down due to lack of student . 
interest. However, the new sta- 
tion could be started with some 
of the old equipment. 

According lo Shilling. Ihe old 
equipment is analog and must be 
converted tt '' "

Study shows lU

BLOOMINGTON, Ind, (lU 
News) — A recent study has 
shown Ihat Indiana Uiuversity 
eJccels in providing quality rela- 
tionships (or students with other 
students, faculty members and 
administrators while providing 
a supportive campus environ- 
ment that allows students lo 
tfinve academically and socially. 

The study, conducted by Ihe 
National Survey of Sludf-' 
Engagement, (ocused on ai 
demic ieammg m a college en 
ronment, 

NSSE provides information 
on effective teaching practices 
and student experiences for 
some 155.000 first-year and sen-

leges and universities. 

Some 1,100 lU Btoominglon 
students were included among 
Ihe 16/)00 students surveyed al 
73 large universities in the study. 

The lUB freshmen and seniors 
scored higher on average in all 
five categories when compared 
to other large research universities. 

The survey measured levels 
of academic challenge, coUabo- 
rative learning, interacHons with 
faculty members, ennching edu- 
cational experiences and sup- 
portive campus environment. 

lU received high marks 
for its supportive campus

Student support is one of the 
major issues the group is facing.

Shilling and the rest of the

They anticipate offering a 
wide selection of music from all 
genres, while also considering 
the idea o( a morning or afler-

Opinions 



Letters to the Editor 



LeCs gel J few Ihin^ straighl. MosI people do no! 
check /acts belore Ihcy express an opinjon on politics or 
polilicians. Fifsl of all, Ihe piesidctii Kas very litlle lo do 
wilh the health ol the nslicmal economy. Since the end of 
[he Depression, our economy has been remarkjbly pre- 
dictable. It goes up and then down because it cannot con- 
tinue lo move upwa/d indefituiely. The economy took its 
downturn before the las r presidential election. Anyone 
who is confused about how our economic system works 
c.in refer lo Dr. Robert Taylor's "Life. Love, and 
Economic? " It is the most basic book 1 am aware of on the 
.ubiecl. 

The Jifference between Democrats and Republicans 
when it (orncs to the economy is who they believe should 
be spending Ihc money: the government or the general 
pupulalion. It is also important to note that the top 30 per- 
cent ol income earners in this country are paying 96 per- 
cent of the taxes. You caruiol cut taies for people who are 
not paying taies. I hope that anyone who believes that 
people who arc financially successful deserve a smaller 
percentage of every dollar they cam is never put in that 
silualion. Resenting the hardworking or affluent is not 
helping the poor 

Second, most people who discuss polities love gross 



generalizations because they are ver&gt;' easy to spin. When 
teaching public relations, the nightly news works well as 
an example of how to put a spin on information. Anyone 
who thinks they are pijlitically awate l&gt;ecause they 'read 
the paper or watch the news is misinformed. I recommend 
Bernard Goldberg's "Bias." 

Third, the word 'peace' has different mear\mgs to dif- 
ferent people. As the wife of a veteran and the grand- 
daughter of veterans, I do not believe that an attack on a 
United States embassy or the attack on the USS Cole con- 
stitutes an admliustrahon of peace War was declared on 
us. Complacency does not figure into my definition of 
peace. There are many of us who could not care less who 
Bill Clinton has sex with; we have real reasons for not 
bemg impressed with him. 

Finally, for everyone who does not check facts, sever- 
al Democrats are mixed up in the Enron ordeal, along with 
the Republicans we keep hearing so much about. 
Remember that when you speak or write about politics, 
there might be someone educated about it close by.

1 gel up each morning, eager to face a new day. but I 
don't start with a brain wiped free of memories. President 
George VV. Bush and my Indiana congressman, Mark 
Souder, both said to show patriotism by spending. Rep. 
Souder told us to "buy, buy, buy," and boasted that his

In America. Protestantism and capitalism (including 
materialism) arc joined at the hip and "Greed" is viewed 
,is a blessing from God. It's time we widen the umbrella of 
immorality to include business and ethical abuses, along 
with sexual misdeeds, 

I'll respect George VV. Bush when he holds his con- 
si'r\'ative friends and relatives accountable for their bla- 
tantly biased actions during the past nine years. They 
spent eighl years well-funded by shadow power brokers 
determined lo destroy President Clinton and drive him 
from office, even if it cost the Constitutional concept of a 
duly elected presidency. The impeachment gave the world 
Ihc impression that a weakened presidency reflected a 
weakened government and an insincere populace. The 
coi\scrv a lives' actions may have given terrorists around 
the world the incentive to attack the United States. 

I'll respect George W. Bush when he calls lor hear- 
ings to rethink the concept of deregulation. Some indus- 
tries should never be operated for-profit: water systems; 
power and telephone companies; police and fire depart- 
ments; hospitals and health care; rest homes and prisoru. 
Enron's colbpse came in Ihc nick ol time to save Social 
Security from being raided by slock brokers and invest- 
ment firms eager lo "help for a fee" the" in Experienced 
potential invi-stor who is convinced he can make millions 
by investing in the high risk stock market. 

I'll respect George W. Bush when he acknowledges 
that Clinton wasn't a draft dodger, explains the gap in his 
own National Guard period and apologizes to Senator 
John McCain for accusing him of being mentally unstable 
for Ihe presidency because he spent several years in a 
Viclcong prison. It Clinton was unsuitable because he did- 
n't serve m a war and McCain was unsuitable because he 
did, who's left? 

Americans have three psychological hang-ups: slav- 
ery, imperialism and monarchy George VJ. coufd set an 



example and truly become a statesman for America if he 
dealt wilh these issues. Citizcr^s still argue that the Civil 
War was fought for slate's rights and get defensive if 
reminded that the stale's right they fought for was to own 
another human being totally and forever. 

Imperialism was on its way out belore the United 
Slates had a chance lo be Ihe new kid on Ihe block of 
world domination. Are we about lo use "War on 
Terrorism" as an excuse lo become imperialists in 2002? 
We're charging across nations and around Ihe world and 
leaving troops wherever we go with the justification thai 
it'sallfor Ihe sake ol Ihe people we're saving but we can't 
shove democracy down the inroals of other nations when 
we don't even like lo practice it ourselves. 

George Washington turned down a chance to be 
king, but the concept keeps rearing its ugly head. The 
power of the presidency is no doubt intoxicating, but it's 
an addiction we don't need in our presidents. In recent 
weeks. George W. Bush has been strutting around like 
King Louie himself, while the While House, decorated in 
holiaaytvhiteand gold and off limits to citizens, looks tike 
a palace. If George W. Bush and Rudy Guiliani can rise lo 
the occasion of a national crisis, most men or women in 
similar positions would do the same. The nation is more 
than its president; it's the collective strength ol all its peo- 
ple, regardlcM of their politics, religious beliefs or ethnicity. 

Ill nwpect George W. Bush when he holds his con- 
servative sisters accountable for their practices of person- 
al destruction during Ihc Clinton administration. Blond 
talking heads such as Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham and 
Barbara Olsen made a pro^table living by talking and 
writing about Bill and Hillary Clinton as if they were llies 
on the walls of every room Ihe Clintons ever occupied. 
On a recent C-Span broadcast of a speech given by Arm 
Coulter to a group of young Republicans at Oregon State 
University at Corvallis, she stated that when the white 
man came lo America, there wei« less than 100.000 
Indians, all who were nomadic savages who spent their 
limeTtalptngwhiteTelllers. No one in the audience chal- 
lenged her ignorance. She needs a course on American 
history; but T wonder, does she reflect the mentality of 

I'm as patriotic as Mr. Diehl. I've voted in every elec- 
tion since 1958, with the exception of a few primaries.

1 know that most people have noticed the little signs 
in the Registrar's Office and in the Firuncial Aid Office 
thai say things about the student being Ihe reason Ihe 
employees have a job, and that students are the reason for 
us being hero and they are not a distraction. Apparently 
the Bursar's Office does not subscribe to this philosophy. 

1 have an associate's degree from IPFW and my wife 
currently attends classes at IPFW. On Jan. 25, we noticed a 
charge on our bank account Irom IPFW. As we have finan- 
cial aid, it was strange that IPFW would charge our bank 
account. Further, the debit card to which the charge was 
made is only 30 days old and had been used only a hand- 
ful ol times. It has been determined that the charge is 
fraudulent. Our card number has apparently been stolen 
and someone at Ihe uruversity has used it to make a pay- 

We contacted the Bursar's Office to let them know 
that a fraudulent charge has been made to our bank 
account. We were told by an employee that they had no 
way to track this charge without going through all student 
records, which they (were not willing lo do. We were out of 
luck. They took no personal information and made it clear 
that they were not going lo do anything. 

At our bank'sadvice, we went to the school in person 
to ask them again. We were confronted by the same very 
rude person whom we had spoken to on the phone. She 
said it would take several days and that she had already 
told us all of this (Remember, she took no personal infor- 
mation, so it would be impossible for her to actually tie 



investigating anylhmg.) 

It does not take a business major to figure out that 
there is no bill to match lo Ihe charge to our bank account. 
We, in fad, have never used our debit card at IPFW lo pay 
our bills. The school continues ils stand. VVe have been 
told that our bank will have lo refund the money to us and 
our baidc will have lo go after IPFW to recover its losses. 
The school will not rehim any money. I expect a little more 
from a university. 

It seems those liltle signs only apply when Ihe uni- 
versity wants people to sign up lor class and spend 
money When it comes to matters of money, the school 
comes first and the consumer is on his own. Perhaps the 
employees of the Bursar's Office need lo take a couple of 
courses on ethics and customer scA'ice — at a school that 
uses those principles themselves. 



Editor's note: Since this letter lais wrillen the Ralm's were able 
to get the situation resolved wilh the help oflheirfinancial insti- 
tution. Although unaware ofoftlic situation, Phil Crotc. IPFW

Criteria for love 



do 1 have a girlfriend at this time?' 
The simple answets to Ihes* simple questions, more often 

than nol. are not so simple. 

The simplesi answer for whv I don't have girlfriend is 

because I have chosen nol lo, mairJv because, at this time, 1 

haven't found an acceptable woman. 

There is so much more to a relationship than simply hnvirtg 

locudJte with and call my girlfriend.

Cod's way of showing Ihal 1 should never \vaiver and never com-

My second demand of a woman u; Ihat she loves Almighty

1 have never waivcred on this demand, for I fully realize that

1 surely have no desire tu spend Ihc rest oi my life with a 
ivomnn who rcfus« lo acknowledge Ihal the only way lo gel lo 
heaven is by accepting Ihe petscnal sacrifice Ihat Jesus made for 
each one ol us upon the cross 3000 years ago. 

Why should I spend eleniity in heaven, a glorious paradise, 
while my unbelieving wife decides to spend eternity in everlasting

It is not about anything that 1 have done myself, nor about my

To those of you who are my friends and to those of you who 
deem me a fiend, liave .t wonderful Valentine's Day. 



A big fashion no-no 

I am considered the fashion guru on staff, and my poor fellow 
journalists have put up with many of my fashion rants and raves. 

Last season, my main rant was Ihe wfiofe high rise decorative 
thong for Ihe ultra low-rise novelty jeans. 

I thai\k Cod every day Ihal the trend didn't tost very long. But 
then that raises a new queslion-what kind of imdcrwcar Ircnd will be 
marketed this spring? 

Before the new trend is in ploce. I thought I ivould make one sug- 
gestion that should be heeded by all females who wear low-rise pants. 

Some things are better left unseen. Yes. I am talking about under- 
^aaa^^S^ wear and other such unmentionables. 
» _, , . ^ Allow me to provide an example. There was a 

• Stflll 9 S'rl i" one of my classes last semester who 
^ ^ always dressed trendy, but had one huge flaw. 

• Pr1Jfi-»T"ial • E^EQ' 1'""^ she sal down, you could always see 
CUILUridl ■ the color, style and fabric type of her underwear, 

___,.,. and generally a bra strap or two. depending on 

• ••••«•• iheparticularshirtstyle. 

For a brief while, I thought I was being over-analytical, but after 
talkmg it over with a few people in the diss and a few people on staff, 
I realized that 1 wasn't quite as crazy as I had originally Ihought. 

Women demand respecl, but how are they to obtain that respect 
if they go around flaunting themselves? Some flaunting is okay— lust 
make sure Ihat you're not flaunting the wrong things. Remember, 
people can wear ivhaiever Ihcy want and still nol gam respecl. It's 
how you carry and present yourself in the clothes that really mailers. 

My whole pomi for this was nol about gaining respect, but tfiat 
people, both guys and girls alike, do not want to sec your most recent 
purchases from Victoria's Secret, 

Designers made low-rise thongs for a reason. Just remember Ihat 
this spring when you're putting on your I.e.i. ultra low-rise jeaiu.

Wirh an age range Ihal 
looked to span from 2-60. 
Icllingham's fans were treated to 
an cnlhiLsiaslic show with 
Corporate Circus and Blue 
Karma as opening acts. 

One noticeable diKcrcnce 
tielween the ages, was that once 
the bands look the stage, the 
young people look the floor and 
their older counterparts mode 
their way to the lables to listen to

students from Leo High School 
who wcreplayinR the card game 
"Magic: The Gathering." It was 
hard for me not lo wonder why 
these young men did not lake to 
the floor like the others: howev- 
er, I was informed that they were 
there lo listen to Jettingham, 
even though they later informed 
me that they thought Corporate 
Circus was a decent bond. 

"We know we are geeks, 
but what else are you going to 
do while you ore waiting for 
JettinEham lo play?" a high 
school photographer asked. 

These young people of the 
Fort Wayne area have wailed a 
long time lo hear Jettingham 
play live. In the four years of 
Jettingham's existence, the band

has changed names. Originally, 
they were called Abraham and 
they have also changed singers. 
An early version of fan 
, favorite "Never. Never, Never" 
landed them local airplay, and 
they soon silgned to 
Republic/Universal Records. 
Radio staple "Cheating" made it 
on the "American Pie 2" sound- 
track. However, thmugh all of 
this, (ettingham has never 
played an all-ages shoiv. 

"1 was surprised when they 
were going to be playing at 
Picasso's and it was going lo be 
all-ages. I thought that they wen? 
just going to play ai bars." one 

foung fan said, adding that he 
as followed the bantTs dcvel- 



erupled from the ctuwd when 
the band's name was uttered. 
Fans purchased concert t^hirts 
and they sought out the mem- 
bers of the band, who graciously 
signed the merchandise. The 
conversations Jettingham had 
with the fans in the audience 
were what manv of those in 
attendance said that they would 
remember about the show. 

One disgruntled fan 
thought Ihal the people in the 
fioni of the crowd were l&gt;eing 
too rough with the younger 
membcts of the audience and 
vocalist Dave Schmoekel made 
an oruiouncement immediately 
after a Blue Karma song, helping 
lo calm the excited fans. 

VVben leltinghams scl 
began and the applause faded 
enough to hear what Schmoekel 
was saying to Ihe audience, I 
made my way thnaugh part ol 
the crowd, which at that point 
had expanded to the point of 
nearly engulling alt of Picasso's. 

II was m the crowd where 1 
saw three teenage girls, all hang- 
ing on to each other's hands. 

They were Irying to make it 
lo the Ironl of the crolvd to be 
able to see Jellingham better, but 
every lime they tried to advance, 
they were met with heavy resist- 
ance. The girls would push for- 
ward and Ihe crowd, not being 
eiempl of Newton's ThinJ Laiv, 
pushed them back with more 
force. In a human tidal wave, 1 
found myself being forced closer 
to Ihe back of the crowd. 1 gave 
up and found myself wandering 
at the edge. 

There I saiv j toddler on the 
shoulders of his young lather,

IS an all-ages show,' Ihe pnsud

that he would not take Ihe child

On the other side of the

gray hair made Ihem look con- 
spicuously older than the rest of

seeming to enjoy each other's

Play offers genius humor

Throughout the human

itself in many surprising places. 
Likewise, it has no doubt made

Set in a bar in Paris around

Broadway play "Picasso at the

around Ihe fictional meeting ol 
two such geniuses— artist Pablo 
Picasso and scientist Albert

show, a confluence of artistic 
and scientific genius ending in a 
surprising manner. "It's all 
related lo Einstein's theory ol 
relativity — basically that every- 
thing is relative. It s very tunny; 
not like, a Saturday Night Live 
sketch, but it still has some very 
intelligent humor" 

■ Brian Porter, who plays 
Einstein opposite fourth-year 
IPFW theater major Mark 
Dunn's Picasso in the produc- 
tion, concurs with Purse- 
Wiedcnhoeft's assessment ol Ihe 
play's wit tin ess. 

This (play) has been the 
most fun for me in terms of 
developing or being able lo use 
my comic serue, v^ch I don't 
have much of." Porter said jok- 
ingly. "This show is by for the 
best in terms of comedy that I've 
had to do." 

In preparation for his part 
as the brainy physician, Porter 
said he tried to read as much as 
he could about Einstein. He said 
be read all of the letters Eirutein 
wrote to his first wile, as tvetl as 
ijarts ol Einstein's book, "The 
World as 1 See It," and a biogra- 
phy on the scientist. 

This research ivoutd prove 
useful in gaining a sense of how 
Einstein would react in different 
sihiations, though he confesses 
Ihat the Einstein in the play is 
different from Ihe Einstein his- 
lory remembers. 

"The Einstein in the play is 

Eiiatein as in real life," Porter 
said, "so I've taken a lot of artis- 
tic liberty with it. l\t don't actu- 
ally know if Einstein would do 
some of the things in Ihe show 
but for the sake of the play, 
that's how we do il." 

Other actors who lacked 
Ihe luxury of reading materials 
about their characters had dif- 
ferent means of preparation. 
Jason Griif. a third-year Iheater 
major at IPFW. was one of Ihese 

In preparation for his role 
OS Freddy, the oivner and bar- 
tender of the Lapin Agile, Graf 
i«lied on his past experiences 
and a little help from a faculty 
member- 

-I used lo work at Qub 
Soda, so I had that experience." 
Cr^f said. *1 also stiadowed one 
of the laculty members who also 
&gt;vorks at Henry's, wliidi is a bar 



downtown, Freddy ^sn'l based 
on a factual character like Albert 
Einstein is, so il's kind of my 
interpretation of tiim." 

Graf's character is a good 
example of the playwright's 
miking of fact ivith fiction as 
Freddy interacts with Picasso 
and Einstein throughout the 
production. 

The aclors weren't the only 
ones doing research on the play, 
hoivever. In conducting her own 
research on the play. Purse- 
Wiedenhoeft said she discov- 
ered a fascuiating fact about the 



playivrich

self. 



iteresting is in 
researching the play, 1 found out 
that Steve Martin ivas a philoso- 
phy major as an undergrad m 
college and later in life became a 
real art aficionado. You can real- 

Ksec that inHuence in the play." 
)th of these aspects arc evident 
in theplay.shcsaid.bul Ihe play 
IS still very furuiy. 

"There arc all these differ- 
ent layers," Purse-Wiedenhoeft 
said, Tou can look at the sur- 
face of the play ond enjoy the 
comedy. If you think about the 
issues he brings up, it can be 
kind oi dark. Our production is 
a warm and thoughtful produc- 
tion of Ihe piece. We're not 
exploring the darker aspects." 

Martin plays are fike that, 
though, according to Life. "They 
tend to have a bite lo Ihem. 
They have something to say. 
There is nothing frivolous about 
he; plays, yet they're funny, very 
funny pieces,"

As lime goes by, it becomes 
clear that Cody's show isn't big

joins a rival wild west show.

Somebody should lake 
McKneely outside and slap him

pid some of the gags thai he 
allowed lo happen were. 

Body mics arc a wonderful 
thing. Especially when Ihe 
sound designer knows his 
stuff, which Mark Norfolk did. 

1 heard not one iota of 
feedback and was able to hear 
Ihe actors perfectly. 

Dislracting me from Ihe 
sound wa.s Ihe (act that I kepi 
seeing their profiles. Not one of 
the acloi^. ihe leads included, 
made it through the show 
without continually forgetting 
lo cheat. Essentially, they broke 
a basic rule of blocking Ihal says 
you should always angle your- 
self oul lo Ihe audience, so as 
much of your body can be seen 
as often as possible. 

While this mainly goes 
back to the days of needing lo 
engineer vour vocal projeclion 
because inere wore no mics, it 
also ensures that your body lan- 
guage and facial expressions 
can be read by the audience. 
Had there nol been mics, the 
audience would have been 
unable to pick up on this. This 
was McKneely's (irsi (aux pas.

Song titles can be deceptive and this somber number is no excep- 
tion. Comprised by a lesser known band, this song describes of a woman

— "A Fairytale of New York" by the Pogues 

This is not a tale about violence toward the women, but rather is 
about what happens to alt relationships gone bad. Usually remembered 
at Christmas time, tHb pain in this song can be felt year round,
