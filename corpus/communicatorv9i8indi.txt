CHEVETTCS 

ARE HERE 




They're a lot more car for 
a lot less money.* 

Astounding, but true! The 78 Chevettes offer you even more car for less 
money than last year. We added 17 new standard features and still kept the 
price below last year's Chevette with the same equipment. 

Here are a few of the new standard features included on the '78 Chevette! 
For starters, you get a peppy 1 .6 Litre engine. And an AM radio. For looks, 
there are items like white stripe tires, sport steering wheel, body side 
moldings, deluxe grille, wheel trim rings . . . more! 

You get all this added to last year's standard equipment. 

The '78 Chevy Chevette. More than ever, it's a big value small car. 

•Comparison of manufacturer's suggested retail price for a 1977 Chevette Coupe witti 
features now standard on a 1978 Ctievette Coupe.
