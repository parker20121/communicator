Administration Manipulalin*^ Constitution?? 



In the pp.st, T was led 
to believe that the ad- 
ministration, while not 
alvrays rierht, was at 
lepst lep-,-al in their 
means of control. 
Recent incidents have 
changed Tny opiniono 
As of this v/ritinp:, a 
hearinp; has been set 
for Mr. Horowitz' case 
before the faculty con- 
duct coinmittpe as opp- 
osed to the review 
board. The adminis- 
tration offers several 
exciises for this. All 
of thPTTi are at best, 
nnr^Tffonable. 

The oriprinal issue 
was a matter of consti- 
tutionality. I"ir. Hor- 
owitz, holds the status 
of lecturer, which is 
clearly recor^nized as 
compri sinp: part of the 
facultj^ on the I. IT., 
campus at Fort V/ayne,, 
Section II of the fac- 
ulty constitution 
states: "The Deans, 
professors, instruct- 
ors, lecturers, and 
pr o f e ssional ITbrari ans 
havinr academic ap- 
pointEezrfcts shall con- 
stitute the faculty of 
1:11. ?^t Fort Wayne, and 



shall be votinp- members 
thereof „ " (emphasis 
added) 6 

In accordance with 
this constitution, Mr. 
Horowitz requested a. 
hearinp: as was his 
ripht as a faculty mem- • 
ber« Section XXIJI of 
I.U„ at Fort V/s;;me . 
clearly rrants this: 
"Anv member of the f ac- - 
PJ^ 3^ sir in p- a review 
of administrative act- 

i-on... shall request in 
writing a hearing. . . " 
(emphasis added). 

Since the admini- 
stration knows that a 
big misrepresentation 
of facts is often more 
convincing t!ian a small 
one . at first they 
didn't try tampering 
with the meanings of 
these passages. They 
gust switched consti- 
tutions. This iriauSt 
surely rank as one of 
the finer points, 
in tlie art pf admini- 
stration. The reason 
for the change was thi^*; 
the constitution at this 
campus has not yet been 
submitted to* the ^Jnis- 
tees, which implies that

Bloomington, holy "mo- 
ther campus" of us ail^ 
jas beem passed byt'^e 
trustees. In fact it 
has not been passed, has 
not even been submitted , 
and will not be until 
,the constitutions of all 
six regional campuses 
are ready to be submit- 
ted along with it. 

The attrac"civeness of 
the Bloomington consti- 
tution lies in the fact 
that they specifically 
exclude lecturers from 
their definition of fac- 
ulty. As non-faculty, 
any hearing before the 
faculty board of review 
could be denied at the 
whim of the administra- 
tion 

It was with this in 
mind that Dr. St oneb an- 
ger wrote to Mr. Hor- 
owitz: 

"....the Tolan case 
should not be construed 

as a precedent for 

hearings by individuals 
holding the title of 
lecturer. " 

And that is the way 

the matter stood until 
the arrival of vice- 
president Ryan, in 

charge of all regional 
campuses. He stated 
during an open meeting 
with the faculty, that 
in all cases ■ involving 
this campus, he. will go 
by the constitution of 
this campus. 

The next attempt by 
the administration to 
rationalize their deci- 
sion was a redefinition 
of "faculty to ..mean 
teniired faculty. 

What was overlooked, 
aside from the obvious 
fact that no such dis- 
tincion can be fou nd 
in the constitution, is 
that out of 85 voting 

(-onli'nij eol on p^ i 



members of the faculty 
10 are tenured faculty. 
AS the requirements of 
the five man faculty 
review 'board demand 
that each member be 
tenured, this makes the 
board available, at aoiy 
given time, to an over- 
whelming total of five 
faculty members. Num- 
bering among these are 
Dean Broyles, Drs. Bow- 
man and Stonebarcer and 
other distinguished 
faculty - truly the op- 
ressed of our academic 
community. All of this 
is beside the point 
however, since no dis- 
tinction is made in the 
constitution about the 
tenure of any faculty 
member who requests a 
hearing. 

Recognising: this im-»- 
posed limitations -of 
their review board, the 
Faculty Senate then 
created a new board for 
the hearings of nont en- 
ured faculty and stud- 
ents. This is known as 
the Faculty Condust 
C o mmittee , and is 
chaired by another mem- 
ber of our tenured fac- 
ulty. There is he ever 
present danger that the 
administration will 
create so many review 
boards that we will run 
out of tenured faculty 
to sit on them. This 
committee was obviou-Sly 
formed for cases such 
as fir. Horowitz. But 
the last clsuse of the 
paper on the committee 
reads: "'4-. If the com- 
plaint is not satisfied 
he could appeal to the 

board of review «" 

. If the administral 
tion must play games 



and force Horowitz 
through one committee 
to reach the other 
that is their privi- 
lege. He is now enti- 
tled to be heard by 
both the committee and 
the review board if he 
so chooses. 

At one of the first 
meetings requested by 
students to discuss re- 
instatement of Mr. Hor- 
owitz with the admini- 
stration, several in- 
teresting statements 
were made. Dr. otone- 
barger, head of the 
faculty review board, 
feels that he is more 
objective about the 
case because he has ne- 
ver met Mr. Horowitz. 
At the same time, he 
admits to a conversa- 
tion with Dr. Olson a- 
bout Horowitz. Dean 
Broyles said that it 
was impossible to re- 
verse the decision not 
to reinstate Horowitz, 

Which probably made him 
think that a hearing 
would be purposeless. 
Unless the Dean regards 
administrative • /deci- 
sions as Divine, there 
is no reason why the 
decision could not be 
reversed. But it might 
take a near-miracle for 
the administration to 
admit any wrong-doing, 
• What is even more 
important than the spe- 
cific incidence of Mr. 
Horowitz and the other 
lecturers is the bla- 
tant disregard by the 
administration of the 
students, and the con- 
stitution.

Dave Roach - The Univer- 
sity has handled the 
situation very poorly. 
They have made no 
attempt to explain 
their side of the story 
as usual, they have 
remained silent on an 
inportaiit issue. For 
the students to form 
an objective and 
rational opinion, they 
have only heard the 
accusations of the pro- 
Horowitz campaign. 
James S. Rhoem -I be- 
lieve this school's ad- 
ministration has lost 
touch of what an admin- 
istration should do. It 
feels that the opinion 
of us "stoonts" are not 
worthy of objective 
comment. Anybody who 
caxight Dean Broyles' 
fascinating performance 
on TV last week will 
attest to this opiniono 
The students on this 
campus may not spend 
much time here , but 
they do have opinions 
on how to be taught and 
they should be respect- 
ed by the administra- 
tion. I'm really sick

Horowitz RS he sroke to 
stiidents in the Alpha 
£ps"il on i&gt;-an-pa coffee 
house on February IB. 
In his statements Mr. 
Horoviitz was referring 
to freedom in academic 
affairs and went on to 
fi!;ive what, an his opin- 
ion, was the three pur- 
poses of the univer- 
sity. 

T. To discover 
tr"j-th for the survival 
of the society. 

P. To perpetuate 
the freedom that the 
society en.joys, This 
means that students 
must participate "^'n 
school decisions. In 
other words a student 
cannot reali-ze demo- 
cracy unless he par- 
takes of it, 

'i. To help "bring 
abo\it chanp^es in soc- 
iety peacefully, 
Acc'fflrdir&gt;r to Mr. Horo- 
witz, when new ideas 
cannot take place in 
the university with new 
ideas presented by 
teachers there will be 
an explosion, 

Mr. Horowitz is in 
favor of evolutionary 
change rather than 
revoluti onary chanre if 
such is possible. How- 
ever, he is of the op- 
inion that there is un- 
equal opportunity and 
susTiension of complete 
freedom in the univer- 
sity ?! specially in the 
social sciences and 
nnd humanities. '!'o 
illustrate this sup- 
pppssion of freedom and 
opnortunity, Mr. Horo- 



witz cited a study by 
James Glass in the Sat - 
urday Review . The 
study was made on a 
F.vonr^ of collep-e trus- 
tees; more than ^,000 
of these trustees had 
similar characteris- 
tics — 50 years old, 
white, male, well-ed- 
ucated. Republican. 
Two-thirds of this 
ffroup favored a screen- 
inr process for collef^e 
sneakers and felt that 
decisions should be 
made at the top without 
a strong faculty voice, 

Mr. Horowitz be- 
lieves that Fovemment 
is not democratic but 
plutocratic — ruled by 
the rich. This event- 
ually permeates every 
institution of the soc- 
iety including the uni- 
versity, and conse- 
ouently there is not 
this wide spectriam of 
ideas being expressed 
which is the primary ob- 
.iective or function of 
the university. 

According to Mr. 
Horoxvitz, the problem 
arises in the fact that 
the faculty often vn' sh- 
es to perpetijate the 
system in v/hich they 
have a position of 
wealth and power. He 
went on to say that 
althoiigh the university 
is part of a democratic 
whole, it is a very in- 
direct democracy. To 
remedy this Mir.Horo- 
vritz would like to see 
a participator^/- demo- 
cracy in which the 
people directly af- 
fected by decisions 
have a considerable 
amount to say in the 
making of these deci-

approval. without the

at the University of 
Notre Dame, established 
for the sake of saving 
the millions of starving 
people from death inliie 
former rebel stc-te of 
Biafra. 

As you are aware , an 
estimated two million 
Ibo tribesmen have died 
as a result of the Nig- 
erian civil war. Stu- 
dents in America are 
now seeking to do their 
part in constructive 
activism to alleviate 
conditions which cause 
the atrociously large 
numbers of Nigerians to 
starve. It is estimated 
that almost 5,000 of 
these former Biafrans 
are dying each day be- 
cause of the lack of 
distributed food. 

STUDENTS FOR BIAFRAN 
RELIEF seeks to enlist 
aid from students, lay- 
men, political leaders 
and corporations naticn- 
wide to express their 
views to the world on 
the situation. It is 
our opinion that the 
United States govern- 
ment, through its state 
department, could make 
a greater effort to 
cause a change in the 
abhorrent conditions of 
hunger in the former 
enclave. 

That is why we are 
appealing to you; to 
ask your endorsement of 
any effort to end the 
problem and for supoort 
in entreating the Pres- 
ident of the United 



States to follow his 
own stand on the sutoect*' 
"The terrible tragedy 
of the people of Biafra 
has now assumed catas- 
trophic dimensions 

this is not the time to 
stand on ceremony or to 
go through channels' or 
to observe the diplo- 
matic neceties. The 
destruction of an erfcire 
people is an immoral 
objective, even in the 
most moral of wars. It 
can never be justified 
it can never be con-
