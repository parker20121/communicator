Equity increase main request at Legislative Luncheon 



by Mlshanna Wood 



News Editor 

At [he Legislative Issues Luncheon on 
Nov. 19, Ihe imponaiicc of equity funding 
for IPFW was presented 10 some of our 
suite legislators. 

IPFW is the sixth largest school in the 
state, yet funding is ranked 14th out of 16 



many buildings at IPFW but no updated fPFW arc not properly equipped. However, 
technology to fill ihcm. There is a need for on the outside IPFW appears 10 be thriving, 
technological competitiveness. Without the For example, the business school has 

funding, IPFW can't keep up. 

Phil Laux, president of the 
greater Fori Wayne Chamber of "Without 
Commerce, expressed the ways , 

in which IPFW has an economic eCjUlty funding, 
impact on Northeast Indiana. .__.,. ,, 

"We want 10 attract adiffcr- IrhW Can I 



lighei 
Education. 

A S500.000 equity adjustment for 
Purdue Calumet, S600.000 for Purdue North 
Central and SI million for IPFW is being 
requested. 

These three schools have less than the 
$4,000 average funding per student for 
regional campuses. 

First to speak on the need for equity 
funding was Walt Branson, vice chancellor 
for financial affairs. 

Branson made the point that there are 



ent type of composure. We have 
' glhai

our future

According to Laux, 

future is in a labor pool that is 



highly knowledgeable and capa- ©mplOVerS 
ble of handling software. 



"There aren't loo many 
schools like this one in Northeast 

Indiana," Laux said. 

George Bullion, associate 
professor of economics, then spoke on the 
faculty and campus needs, 

He also stressed thai the buildings at 



basic courses but no 
insurance classes. 

This is one chal- 
lenge to keep programs 
nationally accredited. 

Every five to ten 
years the campus has 
accreditation reviews. 

Money is put 
imo a program so it can 
be successfully accredit- 
ed, The program is then 
neglected until the next 
review. It is the only strat- 
egy you can pursue with 
little funds, said Bullion. 

This is ihe 
IPSGA president unbalanced system that 
has gone on for many 
years, leaving some areas outdated and oth- 
ers updated. 

According to the Budgetary Affairs 



-Chuck Newman, 



Subcommittee there are seven deficicne: 
that need to be addressed; staffing of pro- 
grams, full lime faculty, technology and 
in siru mentation, library, leaching develop- 
ment, communication outreach and compet- 
itive salaries. 

This has been one of several requests 
for funding. 

Jim Pappagiannis. a senior with a mar- 
keting major, spoke from the student poinl 
of view. 

He stressed that students need to leam 
skills with the same technology used in the 
workplace, and students may choose not to 
attend IPFW if ihe technology isn't up 10 
date. 

The state needs to give Purdue more 
money, and Purdue needs to send that 
money out to satellite schools, continued 
Pappagiannis. 

"I believe that students need to get 
involved with state senators and representa- 
tives to achieve equitable funding for IPFW. 
Without equity funding, IPFW can't meet 
the needs of industry for our future employ- 



ers," Chuck Newman, IPSGA president 
said. 

On Feb. 10 the IPFW Alumni 
Association is providing a bus which will 
leave at 9 a.m. to Indianapolis for 
Legislation Day, which is hosted by 
Hoosieis for Higher 
Education. 

This is a chance for 
students, faculty, staff, 
administration and 
alumni to come together 
to speak to legislators 
on what IPFW needs. 

Last year 35 stu- 
dents attended. The goal 
for 1999 is 105. 

'The voice of the 
students is the loudest 
voice of all," said 
Jennifer Bosk of Alumni 
Services.

Visiting associate 
professor shares 
fiction stories 



by Mlshanna Wood 



The dilemma 

Rumpelstiltskln ran 
into when he broke one 
of his rules and the 
aspirations of a woman 
who followed her hus- 
band were the subjects of Peggy 
Woods' short fiction stories, "A 
Spinster's Tale," and novella, 
"Wanderings." 

She shared her works at the sec- 
ond faculty reading in Walb 224 on 
Mon., Nov 16, 

Woods is a visiting assistant pro- 
fessor this year. 

She has a master's degree in 
creative writing from California 
State Universiiy-Northside and a 
doctorate from SUNY- Albany. 

Her stories have been published 
in "Quarter After Eight," a prose and 
commentary journal, "Thirteenth 
Moon," a feminist magazine, and 
hypertext in "The Little Magazine." 
The first reading from a "A 
Spinster's Tale" is the story of the 
curious man who traveled from one 
place to another, spinning any qual- 
ity of wool into a fine material and 
spinning straw into gold. 

However, the spinster could 
only spin straw into gold if it were 
for someone else 

As the story goes on. the wan- 
dering "spinster who could spin the 
undesirable to the desirable" wanted 
something in return for his work. 

This need for something in 
return was breaking one of his per- 
sonal rules used when spinning his 
creations. 

Consequently, a bad reputation 
builds up about the spinster. 

A miller's daughter has been 
falsely acclaimed as one who can 
spin straw to gold. 

The spinster has to find a way to 
help the maiden with her falsely 
acclaimed abilities. 

"A Spinster's Tale" is pan of a 



dissertation. 

Woods found her idea from the 
word "spinster." which means "an 
unmarried woman." 

Spinning fabric was also one of 
the few occupations available for 
single women. 

Woods' second reading, 
"Wanderings," is about a woman 
who feels trapped having to follow 
her husband. 

Peter does not understand why 
his wife wants to go about life in her 
own seemingly unorganized manner. 

The wife always feels as if she is 
where Peter expects her to be 

In this novella. Woods uses sym- 
bolism via a trip to the Hurst Castle. 

The trip represents the wife's 
desires to travel to a taboo place. 

A school of green turtles swim- 
ming represents unison and the abil- 
ity to travel as one. 

"Wanderings" came from a col- 
lection out of an English class which 
used writing exercises that were 
originally hypertext 

The novella is written in a 
series. 

Woods wrote the different parts 
of the series at different times, cut- 
ling and pasting (he piece together. 

Both of her stories involve an 
escape out of a particular role ihe 
main characters have been asked to 
play. 

Woods hopes 10 have 
"Wanderings" published in a maga- 
zine and "A Spinster's Tale" as a 
book 

Woods said she was a person 
who has always wanted 10 be a 
writer her whole life. 

"Write and read a wide variety 
so you can talk about wbat you write 
with others. Then your writing does- 
n't occur in isolation. Keep at it and 
don't get discouraged," said Woods. 

The final session is on Mon. 
Dec. 7 ai the same location and lime. 

Students and faculty will read 
from their poems and stories. 



And the Winner is. 




Chanel, a.k.a. Patrick King, was crowned the first Miss Gay IPFW on 
Sunday. 




'Chanel' 
wins first 
Miss Gay 
IPFW 
Pageant 

by Mlshanna Wood 
fleWS Editor 

United Sexualities sponsored the 
university's first Miss Gay IPFW 
Pageant on Sunday, Nov. 22. 

"For our first attempt as a pageant 
we did a very good job even though we 
were inexperienced," Jeff Sterling, a 
member of United Sexualities said. 
"We will take what we learned this 
time to improve the pageant next year." 

There were four competitors: 
Ashia. Chanel, Somone and Ginger 
Manchester. 

All competed in the male inter- 
view, talent and evening wear 
categories. 

In ihe male interview portion, par- 
ticipants were judged on human skills 
and wbai they were looking for in life. 

The talent competition featured lip 
synching to a hit song. 

Contestants were judged on show- 
manship, choreography, quality and 
overall value. 

The evening wear competition was 
judged on hairstyle, appearance and the 
contestant's overall presentation. 

Judges made their decisions based 
on fashion and entertainment and 
awarded the evening's crown to 
Chanel. 

His real name is Patrick King, and 
he performed a lip synch to "My Heart 
will go On." 

King won $100, a bouquet of flow- 
ers and ihe first ever Miss Gay IPFW 
crown. 

The pageant was also used as a 
fundraiser for the United Sexualities 
club. 

"We raised $300 from the contest 
and we 'are using the money lo buy 
cloihes and gifts for families in need." 
Sterling said. 

United Sexualities adopted three 
families this year, all with children. 



Home health care advocates continue to lobby for change 



Chief Reporter 

Nursing homes covered by Medicaid 
are facilities round throughout the nation 
which provide an environment for elderly 
persons who cannot care for themselves. 

What most people do not realize, bow- 
ever, is that a more cost-efficient measure is 
home health care, something less expensive 
and more preferred by (be elderly. 

Area senior citizens met in laie 
November with the American Association 
of Retired Persons (AARP) 10 discuss the 
problem in Indiana of institutional care. 



Indiana has only one program, 
CHOICE, designed for providing home 
health care for the elderly. Even though 
home health care costs less than nursing 
home care, the program has funding 
restraints. 

There are many people in nursing 
homes who could be assisted in living, in 
Ihcir own borne, actually for less money." 
Steven Carter, Legislative Representative 
for AARP, said. "It's just a matter of the nec- 
essary funding being available." 

Because nursing homes provide 24-hour 
care, the cost is often three to five times 
more for someone to stay in a nursing home 



rather than receive in-home care. 

Over 300 people attended the AARP 
meeting in Fort Wayne because of their con- 
cern with health care funding for the 
elderly. 

"This is something we've (AARP) been 
working on for a couple of years and it will 
probably lake another two to five years to 
accomplish this change," Carter said. "This 
is the seventh forum we've had in the siaic. 
The level of support and interest in members 
has been very strong. Jan. 4 is going to be a 
follow-up forum." 

Besides the work of the AARP, the 
Citizens Action Coalition (CAC) is also 



working to shift money for institutional care 
to CHOICE, so that more elderly can 
receive in-home services and taxing can be 
reduced. 

"CHOICE is for people who need long- 
term care, but not nursing home care." Tune 
Stelle, Regional Organizer for CAC. said. 
"CAC will work to expand funding for the 
CHOICE program to $120 million for the 
2000-2001 biennium." 

Currently, it costs approximately 
$36,000 per year, per client, in a nursing 
home, yet CHOICE costs only around 
S7.000 for the same amount of time. 

"CHOICE clients have a strong voice in 



the quality of care they receive," Stelle said. 
"The client and their family work with the 
case manager to develop a personalized care 
plan." 

By allowing the elderly to remain in 
their homes. CHOICE helps Ibem retain 
dignity and independence, and, at the same 
time, saves considerable amounts of money 
thai comes from taxes. 

CAC is aware that not everyone requir- 
ing medical care can be treated at home, but 
when possible, home treatment saves money 
and is usually preferred by patients. 

For more information 00 CHOICE, con- 
tact Stelle at CAC at 423-1492.

Topic: 

Procrastination 



What we think: 

Now is the time to 
get things done. 



Wc know that there are many of 
you out there who are wailing for the 
last minule (o turn in all of your class- 
work. You are also the people who 
waited for the night before a paper was 
due to start your first draft. 

You will also be the people cram- 
ming for finals right up to the very 
minute that the final starts You are the 
procrastinators. 

Procrastination has its good and 
bad points. Sometimes the results of 
working under great amounts of pres- 
sure can make the project turn out bet- 
ter than just working slowly and not 
having a continuous train of thought. 

Most of the time, this doesn't work. 



For most professors, to get an "A" on a 
paper or exam requires a long term of 
focus on the subject mailer. 

Wilb many papers, it seems as 
tbougb you almost have to lake the 
approach thai you are a bit of a novel- 
ist. You have lo do your drafts and lake 
time in between them to reflect on 
whal you have written The professors 
don't necessarily want the novel 
length, bui rather, the level of 
commitment. 

Tesls and finals are a little differ- 
ent. All you really need lo do for the 
most part is attend the class sessions, 
aiiempl most of the assignments, and 
do a little studying either the night 
before or right before 
the exam starts. This 
works for most people, 
but not for everyone. 
You should figure out 
whal works best for 
you and stick to it. 

If you are a pro- 
crastinator like many 
of us, we have a sug- 
gestion for something 
to try next semester. 
Try starling on all of 
your papers as soon as 
you have a grasp of 
what the assignment 



is. If you don't get the grasp of the 
assignment in a short amount of time, 
ask the professor. That's what they are 
there for. 

One thing to try to do to prepare for 
tests is to just go over your notes once 
or twice a week lo get all of the infor- 
mation saturated into your brain. 

For all of you procrastinators out 
there, we have a little message. You 
have been putting things off until the 
last minuie, and everything is going to 
be due soon. Now is the time for you lo 
slick ihe throttle in high gear and gel 
everything done. There is no one lo 
blame but yourself if you don't get 
everything done.

Student Senate going-ons 



Dear Students of IPFW, 

I would like to follow up on 
the letter submitted by the Vice 
President Joe Schroeder. 

The Indiana-Purdue Student 
Government Association 
Student Senate has made head- 
way and progress in addressing 
the key issues here at IPFW. 

In the upcoming weeks, the 
Student Senate will address the 
issue of parking once again, 
establish a web site for students 
who would like to sell their 
books and other ideas will 
come forth by you the students. 

And the call-to-arms by the 
Vice President has convinced 
five more IPFW students to 
join their student government 
to see that change is possible. 
This is a great start to the 
Student Senate for 1998-1999 
school year. And we are still 
not done. 

Over the next couple of 
weeks. College Cable Access 
Channel 6 will begin airing 
"IPSGA Senate Profile." This 
show will profile six student 
senators, so that you the stu- 
dents will get a chance to know 
your senators more. 

I encourage you to watch the 
program, either on campus or at 
home. Also, in the coming 
weeks, this newspaper will also 
do profiles of representatives 
in your Student Government. 

This was all made possible 
by the Public Relations 
Committee of the Student 
Senate, because it is vital that 
every student knows who rep- 
resents them in Student 
Government. 

This year has also been suc- 



cessful for my friends over at 
the Student Activities Board. 
They have also had an increase 
in membership, thanks in part 
to Ryan Smith. President of 
SAB. 

I encourage you to attend 
the next SAB Even t in 
December called Breakfast 
with Santa. 

IPSGA had a rough start this 
year with losing Shawn Heit as 
president. As a result of ihe 
Student Senate and SAB agree- 
ing that there should be a stable 
government here at IPFW, 
IPSGA will never have a rough 
start again. 

The elections will be com- 
ing up shortly for IPSGA, so I 
encourage anyone who wants to 
run lo please slop by Walb 225 
and ask how to do it. 

But, I also encourage you, 
the students of IPFW, to vote, 
because it is very important 
what each and every student of 
IPFW does in IPSGA over the 
1999-2000 school year. After 
all, this is YOUR STUDENT 
GOVERNMENT. 

It has been a great first half 
of the year, serving as a 
Senator, and I am looking for- 
ward to the second half of the 
year. So, if you have a ques- 
tion, commeni or concern, call 
IPSGA at 219-481-6586 or 
e-mail stugovt@ holmes. ipfw 
edu/ or stop by Walb 225. I 
want to represent the students 
well here. Thank you.

Weil, two more weeks, and we 
start taking tests again I hope this 
college degree concepi works oui 
because I am getting burned out on 
school. 

Counting the first lime I went to 
college, this spring will be my 
ELEVENTH semester. Maybe it's 
the nonsense of driving here, going 
to class, and then leaving. 

Maybe I'm just sick of the grind 
of reading material that doesn't 
relate to what I want to pursue as a 
career. 

Why in the hell do I have to take 
Finite Math? My supervisor tells me 
that I will never have to apply it. 
Sounds like colleges are making 
money off of poor suckers like me. 
And how come some students 
have to take a language? Pretty 
funny stuff when you think about it. 
Okay, not really. 

Again, could we get the clocks 
on campus on the same time? And 
we all talk about recycling but are 
you doing your pan? 1 realize that 
those of you who read the papers 
are probably mature, responsible 
adults. 

We need to recruit the idiots on 
campus and let them know that they 
can recycle. 

Just stop throwing away the 
plastic and aluminum. Save the 
planet. 

I can't stress the environment 
enough. Please, think about the 
future. I know I sound like a hippie, 
but we arc the ones who can step up 
and make it happen. 

I watched "Rudolph the Red- 
Nosed Reindeer" on Monday night, 
what a classic. They just don't make 
'em like that anymore. It still makes 
me happy Believing in Santa Claus 
was probably one of the coolest 
things we ever were allowed to 
experience. 

The joy of knowing that every- 
one would receive gifts, no matter 
who ihey were, or where they 



where, was such an innocent and 
exciting feeling. 

I think my sister was the one 
who told me Que was no such 
thing as Santa. Broke my little 
heart. I guess I knew at a certain 
point, I just didn't want to burt my 
parents' feelings. 

If you have little brothers or sis- 
ters, I beg you, let them believe. The 
world needs the innocence. 

Speaking of Christmas pro- 
grams, "It's a Wonderful Life" is on 
about a hundred times this month. If 
you have never seen k, you must be 
from another planet. Seriously, 
watch it, it isn't that bad. 

But after about the tenth time, it 
wears you out. The Grinch and 
Frosty are also some of my favorites 
along with Charlie Brown. "Home 
Alone," as silly as it is. still makes 
me laugh out loud. 

Add "Christinas Vacation" with 
Chevy Chase and "A Christmas 
Story" (you know, where the kid 
gets his tongue stuck to the pole) 
and you have a weekend full of 
some great holiday videos. 

If you missed it, the original 
"Halloween" is on the Sci-Fi 
Channel Friday nigbl at nine, 
channel 24 on your Comcast cable 
systems. 

Have you started your 
Christmas shopping yet? Glenbrook 
was packed last weekend. I have a 
feeling that this is the year to cata- 
log shop. 

Even the Internet or QVC has 
got to be easier than fighting the 
traffic on Coliseum. Call me crazy. 
but do Ohio people all drive badly? 
1 know that they don't drive in the 
"big city" that often, but jeez, get a 
map, find out where you are going 
first, then start driving. 

And you guys think parking is a 
problem here, ha! I'll tell you a 
great gift idea: gift certificates. 
Border's for instance has books, 
music, movies, calendars, and cof- 



fee, even books on tape. 

Gift certificates from hardware 
stores for Dad, and get Mom one 
that's good for a manicure and pedi- 
cure from a beauty salon. They'll 
love you Tor it. 

I can't believe how nice the 
weather was last weekend. Ten 
bucks says its not going to be a 
while Christmas, 

All of the so-called meteorolo- 
gists arc saying that the Midwest 
will be dry. but cold. 1 can live with 
that. 

In fact. I'd rather it is 22 than 
92, but that's just me Hot weather 
makes people act crazy. More homi- 
cides during the summer months, 1 
guess it can be too cold to kill. I 
usually spend this time of the year 
in Florida, and it always stays in the 
eighties. 

Let's hope we have a mild win- 
ter, unless you own a snow mobile. 
I had a dream the other night that all 
of the characters in the "Rugrats" 
movie died in a suicide pact cult- 
type thing in southern California. 

Are "Aniz" and "A Bug's Life" 
the same movie? 1 won't see cither 
one so I guess I don't care. 

I see that some toy company is 
trying to make their toy popular this 
year. Crazed adults ripped the doors 
off of a Wal-Mart here in Fort 
Wayne and it made the national 
news. 

No wonder companies don't 
want to stay here. Way to go Fort 
Wayne, thanks for making us all 
look like hayseeds. Sneaking of the 
toy, is it called a Furby? I think 1 
saw "Gremlins" back in 1984, does 
anyone else notice what 1 notice? 
Pro basketball is basically over, 
Notre Dame lost, Randy Johnson 
with the Diamondbacks or Rangers 
(at press time), whai a waste. 

Indiana and Purdue both look 
way overrated in basketball this 
year. Notre Dame has a great 
women's team, if any body, cares. 



The Colts and Bears, I give up, 
I'll be a Vikings fan for the rest of 
the season. 

The Fury are off to a rugged 
start although Damon is playing 
well. The Komets, well, they are 
playing like the Komets. Remember 
to support your IPFW athletes, they 
need us to cheer them on. 

Loser of The Week — people 



who keep their pets outside in cold 
weather. Have a heart. Puppies arc 
only puppies for a while, and then 
they are dogs. 

If you aren't going to respect 
your animals as they grow old, you 
don't deserve lo have one. Be nice, 
have a great weekend.

It's a common misconception that 

church has to be boring-the pastor 

won't talk about issues that are 

relevant to today and the Scripture 

must be read out of the oldest 

version available to be authentic. It 

doesn't have lo be that way. At The 

New Community, we talk about 

current issues and strugfile* thai we 

face in our everyday 

lives. And we find 

answers that work. 

So leave your pillow

Birth of a Hero, Part Two'. Misguided Aspirations 




by Adam Taylor 



Features Editor 

A cool breeze blew in from the 
river as Bilioka wandered through 
ihe woods. 

Motivation was clear in his step 
although the reason for it wasn't vis- 
ible in the look on bis face. 

He had grown in the path of a 
warrior hunter, just as his father had 
wanted him to. 

His eyes stared intently through- 
out the underbrush as his feet tread 
noiselessly on, searching for some- 
thing. 

As he walked he saw many things 
that, should things have been differ- 
ent at the moment, would remind 
turn of his past childhood, 

He saw the tree he and his friend 
Tirin had practiced shooting tbeir 
arrows on and the worn bark 
towards the center that proved their 
marksmanship. 

He saw the rocks they jumped 
off of to swim in the river on days 
like the one he was enjoying that 
day when the sun was hot and the air 
was cool. 

He even saw the spearhead from 
the previous year's Great Feast that 
be broke off while attempting to 
bring down a wild boar. 

All these things passed in front 
of him as if they weren't even there, 
however, as he trotted on with staff 
in hand. 

As be neared a clearing, he sat 
down to rest. 

The sun was warm in this spot, 
causing him to sweat a little, but his 
feel had grown tired and he decided 
a quick rest wouldn't hurt anything. 
Laying down his staff, be 
grabbed the bottoms of his feet and 
began to massage them. 

A storm of relief soon entered 
his body as the pain ceased. 

No sooner did be quit his mas- 
sage than be heard a twig snap and 
he felt himself being pulled to the 
ground. 

He hit his head hard on a nearby 
trunk and all he could see was the 
top of the trees. 

Attempts to free himself were 
futile and he found himself beaten 
by the painted body of his friend 
Tirin. 

"Looks like somebody forgot the 
first rule of pursuing tbe enemy, 
Bilioka," he heard a voice call out 
from beyond a bush a little up the 
path. 

"Yeah," Tirin said with a laugh. 
"Never take a break when you're 
surrounded by a hostile enemy. You 
okay, old friend 1 " Tirin asked as he 
lei Bilioka up. 

"Yeah, I'm okay. Just a little 
stunned. You two got me good this 
time," Bilioka replied as he dusted 
himself off. "You can come out now, 
Polonka. You guys won." 



"We always win. Or I do, any- 
way. This trap was my idea. Tirin 
wanted to go easy on you and let 
you find us." 

"Only because I was tired of 
wailing, Polonka. This was no 
fight — this was an ambush." 

"Ambushes are fighting just as 
well as anything else, Tirin. You'll 
never be chief if you don't learn 
that." 

"1 don't think I'd want to be chief 
if it meant I'd have to lead cowards 
like you into battle," Tirin replied as 
he got a little closer to Polonka. 

Polonka was always good at 
bringing out the worst in anybody, 
and even though Tirin knew it he 
had grown tired of his attitude 

Tirin was ready to challenge 
Polonka to a fight. 

Reading Tirin's thoughts through 
his eyes, Bilioka joined his friend's 
side in an attempt to dissuade him. 

Before Polonka said another 
word, Bilioka cut in with diplomacy 
in his voice. "Come on, guys. 
There's little to be resolved in fight- 
ing a fellow tribesman. All it will 
prove is anger and stupidity." 

"Maybe." Tirin said, "but it will 
make me feel better " 

"I'm up for it, but only if you're 
up for a beating," Polonka arrogant- 
ly replied. 

"You won't feel better when 
you're before the Ramosca and the 
rest of the council and they want to 
know what happened to you two," 
Bilioka interjected "Ramosca is too 
wise to be fooled by the two of you, 
and so is the rest of the council. 
Besides, it's getting late and they'll 
be looking for us soon. Let's start 
beading back to the village." 

"He's right," Polonka said as he 
stared coldly at Tirin. "I guess we'll 
have to finish this up some other 
day, firebrand. My superiority 
would be displayed just as well on 
another day." 

As Polonka finished, be started 
off through the underbrush, leaving 
the two friends 10 walk the trail 
alone. 

He was seething and could hard- 
ly tolerate any more loose talk from 
Tirin and Biboka. 

He would demonstrate his 
prowess later, be resolved. 

Starting back along the path they 
had known so well as young boys, 
Tirin and Bilioka reflected amongst 
each other as Polonka could be 
heard walking angrily through the 
brush. 

The sun had reached its pinnacle 
in the sky hours before and the two 
friends had at least two mites 
remaining on their walk. 

The wind seemed to reflect that 
summer was drawing to an end as 
even though they walked further 
from the river the wind remained 
cool. 

Despite the ending of warmer, 



happier days being present in the 
blowing of the wind, the two friends 
seemed pretty content with them- 
selves and even joked around with 
one another. 

After it had become evident that 
Polonka was out of earshot, Bilioka 
took advantage of his friend's good 
mood and decided to let loose the 
question that had been troubling him 
since the altercation at the clearing 
between Tirin and Polonka 

"Hey Tirin, why do you let 
Polonka get to you like that?" 
Bilioka asked with a troubled voice. 
"Don't you know he does thai on 
purpose?" 

"Yeah. I know He does that with 
everybody. I don't know why it 
bothers me so much, though. It just 
docs." Tirin paused long enough to 
pick up a stick off the ground. 
Grabbing his knife, he began to 
chisel away at the end. "It's like be 
bas a personal vendetta against me 
or something. Have you seen the 
way be looks at me when he talks to 
me? He looks as though he's plan- 
ning to kill me." 

"You don't understand what he 
has against you?" Bilioka asked in 
disbelief. 

"I didn't do anything to him, 
Bilioka," Tirin repUed in a whiny 
voice. "How am I supposed to cor- 
rect the problem if 1 don't know 
what the problem is?" 

"The problem is, he sees you as 
the only other person in the Azou 
tribe that would be a contender for 
chief if anything happened to 
Ramosca. You both excel in all the 
ways of the warrior and you both 
have the most respect from our fel- 
low tribesman. He's jealous of you 
and sees you as a threat to his 
future." 

"Do you really think that, 
Bilioka?" Tirin replied in disbelief. 
"You think I could be the chief 
someday?" 

"Of course I do, Tirin, and so 
does everyone else. The problem is, 
unless you quit letting your passions 
govern your actions, you won't live 
to see that day. You need to begin 
using your mind instead of your 
knife 10 solve your petty disputes. 
Save your hatred for the right time." 
"I have no intention of being a 
leader, though. I have no ambition to 
do it I fight for the purpose of fight- 
ing, not to have others respect me. I 
seek nothing from my fellow man, 
nor do I seek profit from the spoils 
of war. The tbrill of battle excites 
me in a way nothing else ever could 
I have never asked for respect, and I 
should never receive it. As far as I'm 
concerned. Polonka can be chief and 
lead our people to their victory or 
their death He was bom for it." 

"You know you're a better fight- 
er than him, though. You also know 
you beat him in everything else. I 
can't believe you're acting in such 



an ignorant manner, Tirin. You're 
the smartest, the bravest, and the 
most talented man in tbe tribe If 
something ever happened to 
Ramosca and you weren't elected 
leader, a great wrong would have 
been done to the Creaior in wasting 
such talent and skill. What would 
your father say if he was still with 
us?" 

"He'd say nothing has happened 
to Ramosca and thai we shouldn't 
concern ourselves occupying our 
mind with needless worry. Ramosca 
is still young and still a good fighter. 
He still has a few good years left in 
him. Perhaps my mind will change

by then." 

Tirin looked over at bis friend. 
whose mouth was sealed finally 
upon hearing Tirin's flat denial 
Tirin gave him a grin and slapped 
him on the back. 

"Come on. Bilioka. The day's 
almost over. Let's run the rest of the 
way." With that, Tirin broke into a 
sprint for the village, leaving his 
friend behind in the dust. 

With a deep sigh. Bilioka nibbed 
his aching feet one more time and 
took off after him. 

Nothing made him madder 
inside than wasted talent

Womens basketball shows promise 



Sports Editor 

Past performances not indicative 
of future results — No, we're not 
talking aboul stocks and bonds, but 
this years Womens Basketball team. 

The team is off to a disappoint- 
ing 0-6 start, but Is starting to show 
promise. 

Coach Pam Bowden relumed 
three key players last week from the 
volleyball team in Jenny Miller, 
Katie Brucning, and Laura Douglas. 

Their presence should help the 
Dons improve on the team's winless 
record. 



Combined with an excellent 
recruiting class and veteran leader- 
ship, the Dons will be an improving 
team as the season progresses. 

The backcoun is led by freshmen 
guards Kara Moore and Christy 
McMillen This duo has the poten- 
tial to make an immediate impact on 
the GLVC. 

Moore has been given the 
inevitable (ask 10 control the Dons' 
offense, while McMillen was the 
Dons' offense in the Summit City 
Shootout, scoring 37 points. 
McMillen was the only Don select- 
ed to the alt -con fere nee team. 

Guards Tiffany Thomas and 
Justina Payne arc also threats from 
beyond the arc. 



In the frontcourt, forwards Katie 
Bruening, Laura Douglas, Angie 
Womack and Denise Walker will all 
share lime in the lineup. 

Brucning is the heart and soul of 
the team. 

Coming off a successful volley- 
ball season, fans can expect her to 
have a great basketball season as 
well. 

Both Douglas and Womack com- 
plement Brucning nicely. 

Douglas is a physical player, 
while Womack can shoot the rock. 
Both rebound and defend well. 

Womack has been a pleasant 
audition to Bowden's learn. Both 
Womack and Moore have played 
together at Wood Ian and have only 



Recruits give mens basketball 
edge over opposition 



The Mens Basketball season is 
off and rolling. 

The team was ranked last in the 
GLVC due to the fact that the Dons 
only relumed three players. 

What the GLVC did not know is 
that ibis could be one of the best 
teams IPFW has ever assembled. 

1PFW cleared all doubts when it 
stcamrollcd through the Summit 
City Shoot-Out. 

Led by Steve Griffin and Senior 
Port Wayne native Adam Moore. 
the Dons defeated Tri State in the 
championship game. 

This kepi the traveling trophy at 
IPFW for another year. 

The team has one of the best 
recruiting classes in the NCAA, 
including one of the best in school 
history. 

With the perfect balance of 
scoring and defense, IPFW also has 
the luxury of subbing players in and 
out without having to worry about 
losing anything. 

The potent offensive attack 



comes from guards Steve Griffin. 
Tyson Brit and Randy Spicer. 

Spicer spends a lot of time out 
on the court Tor the Dons and turns 
his defensive efforts into offensive 
points. 

Brit, a transfer from Xavier 
University, will add a lot of depth 
and athleticism to the team. 

Griffin is a player who does a 
lot when he is out there. 

A great three-point shooter, he 
can move with and without the 
basketball 

This back court duo has done a 
great job for the Dons 

With silky-smooth point guard 
Mario Wuysang. the back court is 
one of the most fierce in the GLVC. 

The backcoun is fierce, but it is 
the front court that is truly to be 
feared, led by intimidators such as 
Kedran Bamhill, Corey Evans, 
Aaron Ishman, Rich Gawthrop, 
Paul Blankcnsbip and Adam Moore. 

Bamhill is a solid defender. 
Standing at six feel, six inches, be 
causes much confusion among 
opponents' defenses 

Evans is a scorer, he crashes the 
boards and his presence is felt 
immediately. 




known one way-the winning way! 

In the middle, Corey Duncan, 
Kristi Lamb, Mandy Loveless and 
Jenny Miller will have the task of 
battling in the paint. 

Loveless and Duncan arc the only 
returning players besides Brucning 
on this young team. 

Duncan can do it all under the 
basket, while Lamb and Loveless 
can pull up for the jumper. 

Miller is one of the team's best 
defenders and will certainly see a lot 
of playing time in key situations. 

The Dons will be well-rounded 
yet still have not gelled as a team, as 
soon as that happens.. .Waich Out! 



481-6583 



Ishman is a hard-nosed scrap- 
per. He is the epitome of defense 
and has an intensity unmatched by 
any other. 

Gawthrop is a playmaker. He 
can penetrate and score or pull up 
for the jumper. 

Gawthrop is also a threat from 
behind the arc. 

Blankcnship is similar in many 
ways to Gawthrop. 

What Blankenship lacks in scor- 
ing he makes up for in rebounding. 
Both complement each other nicely. 

Moore is in his rourth year 
under Coach Williams. 

His first was at St. Francis, 
where Moore showed his dedication 
and followed Williams over to 
IPFW in '95 

Moore is probably one of the 
best all-around players ever to put 
on an IPFW uniform. 

If this team will rallies behind 
him, be should have a great senior 
year. 

IPFW has all of the right ele- 
ments and should contend in one of 
the toughest conferences in D-2
