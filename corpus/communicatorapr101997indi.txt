Walb 111 became a 
closed-access lab. 

cording to 
Marilyn Gibbons. 
lest coordinator for 
career services, 
Walb 1 1 1 is occu- 
pied "from dusk till 
dawn" April 



through October, the peak pla 
limes. 

"With only 11 computers, we're restrict- 
ed in lime space." said Tina Webber, recep- 
tionist for career services. She says she 
often has to reserve other labs. 

The lab is open four days a week for 
placement testing by appointment. 
Scheduling is important so that services 
offered by the lab do not overlap. The 
School of Education and career develop- 
ment classes often utilize the "Discover" 
program and request Walb 111 for the stu- 
dents to be guided through "Discover." 

Now networked throughout campus and 
accessible through DOS. "Discover" is a 
career exploration program that aids stu- 
dents in choosing a major and career plan- 
ning. It evaluates individual skills and inter- 
ests to assist an individual's occupational 
search. Searches for over 7.000 iwo- and 
four-year colleges, technical and specialized 
schools, and graduate schools are available. 

"Many of the education classes like to 
use this program, because it is a develop- 
mental learning tool,'' said Webber. 

"Technology is important for education 
students to be involved in," said Webber. 

Despite these uses, Frederick, whose 
office is near the lab. says ihe lab seems 
underutilized. 

"There are times during the year it is 
used a lot and other times it is hardly used at 
all," said Fredrick. "Having this modem 
technology, we should make use of it." 

Concerned with 
the usage of the lab,

dent senale pro tern, 
made some calcula-

When she 
inquired why the lab 
should not be consid- 
ered for open-access, 
she was given two rea- 
sons. It was said that 
the lab is not well 
enough supervised for 
open-accessibility and 
that there was a con- 
cern for hacking —

"So many issues have to be discussed. 
We're willing to look into it. But somebody 
needs to do the ground work." said 
Zimmerman "IPSGA or other interested 
students need to start setting up meetings 
and coming up with plans." 

Zimmerman says there needs to be a 
proposal or plan to pay for supervision and 
on-sight repairs if this were to be an open- 
access lab, for Career Service does not have 
the means or budget to provide this. 

'There cannot be an open lab without

Uh oh, Waco 



Is the letter credible? 

A letter claiming responsibility tor tht- bombings of an abortion clin- 
ic and gay bar in AUania makes a reference to the 1993 Branch Davidian 
standoff in Waco, The Dallas Morning News reported Saturday. 

Law enforcement officials, whom the newspaper did not name, said 
the Waco reference is not explicit and they're not even sure the message 
is authentic. 

They did say they are taking the letter seriously, because it threatens 
future attacks and contains intriguing details about the twin blasts at the 
abortion clinic in January and the bar bombing in February. A total of 12 
people were hurt in the attacks. 

Officials also are wary because April 19 is the anniversary of both 
the Waco siege, in which more than 80 Davidians were killed, and the 
Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168.

"Our mission was to be respon- 
sible for movement control of first

division," said Steinbacber. "Our 
modes of transportation were civil-

"There was a big emphasis on

Opera ensemble offers entertainment 



by Amanda L. McAbcc 
SUfT Writer 

Come see Henry Purcell's 
opera, "Dido and Aeneas," this 
Friday and Saturday, at 7:30 pm. in 
Neff Recital Hall This production is 
presented by the IPFW Department 
of Music's Opera Ensemble, in 
conjunction with the University 
Singers and an outside profes- 
sional orchestra 

"Tbe performance is just going 
to be wonderful, 1 know it," said 
Rebecca Hialt McConnaughey, 



assistant professor of music and Ibe 
director of the opera 

The opera is taken from Virgil's 
"Aenid." It tells the story of tbe love 
between Aeneas, the shipwrecked 
Trojan War hero and Dido, the 
queen of Carthage The story is a 
tragedy, but has some comical 
moments. 

"This is a greal opportunity for 
someone who has never experi- 
enced an opera to come and see." 
said McConnaughey. 

Almost all of the roles are dou- 
ble cast due to the amount of student 



participation Tbe leads are as fol- 
lows; Holly Parks and Jane 
Knapcazk as Dido. Chris Rasor and 
Jim Davis as Aeneas, Jenny Arnold 
and Kelly Kcllen as Belinda and 
Bridget Banned as the sorceress. 
Each cast member will perform 
their role once. 

The conductor of the orchestra 
is Paul Mcers, while Gary Lanier 
serves as the choreographer. Donna 
Hartleroad is the assistant musical 
director. 

Some people stereotype 
operas as being for the rich or for 





serious people, but this opera is 
accessible to tbe public According 
to her, it is thought-provoking and 
for those who have not experienced 
an opera, coming to a school pro- 
duction is a great way to see what 
one can offer. 

There will be a public pre- 
view today at 2:30 p.m. Tickets 
are available in Classroom 
Medical, Room 23 , in 
advance or at tbe door 
Admission is $4 for general 
admission; $3 for senior citi- 
zens and $2 for students.

Fear of Ellen's 
'coming out' episode 

Representative of many Americans 



She is gay -- gee over il! Many 
people have their "britches in 
a ttlber" because of the 
expected April 30 episode of 
"Ellen" in which her character sup- 
posedly comes out of ihe closei and 
reveals her homosexuality. Some 
conservatives have asked sponsors 
to withdraw their support of the 
show because of her homosexuality, 
Although we disagree with this con- 
servative view, we tolerate and 
respect il, nonetheless We believe 
homosexuals deserve the same tol- 
erance and respect in return. 

What the producers of "Ellen" 
are really addressing is the issue of 
homophobia -- and so they should 
as long as it exists. What is the fear 
thai so many have about supporting 
"Ellen" once she "comes out"? Is it 
because some think her homosexu- 
ality will rub off onto the viewers? 
Or because some believe that just by 
ainng the episode that homosexual- 
ity is being accepted as a way of 
life? Or is it because some just think 
homosexuality is wrong? 

We ask you to accept homosexu- 
ality from this standpoint: People 
who are gay are bom gay. If you 
accept this premise then you don't 
have to worry about homosexuality 
"rubbing off." Arguments of homo- 
sexuality being "wrong" lose credi- 
bility here as well because if some- 
one is bom a certain way then it is 
not "wrong," it is just differenL 

If you approach homosexual- 
ity from a theological stand- 
point, say Christianity, and per- 
ceive il as "wrong" you must 
know lhat judging is not up to 
you; furthermore, you must 
know that Jesus loves everyone 
- not just the heterosexuals. 



Homosexuality has existed 
throughout history and will continue 
to endure This is why it is so impor- 
tant that there be tolerance for those 
different from you. Although we 
respect everyone's opinion on the 
matter, we do expect just lhat -- 
tolerance 

"Ellen" in many ways is repre- 
sentative of the American Family. 
Many of us here on campus have 
sisters or brothers who are gay. We 
also have -- or know -- aunts and 
uncles, cousins, sons and daughters, 
even mothers and fathers and also 
good friends who are gay. It is in 
this way lhat we can all relate to 
"Ellen" one way or another. 

Many have grown to love and 
laugh wilh "Ellen" -- much like we 
would our own family -- then we 
receive some new news -- she's gay. 
For many, this is enough lo rid her 
from iheir television lives. It is also 
in this way that Ihe show is repre- 
sentative of many families. Some of 
you have probably turned away 
from loved ones once they revealed 
their homosexuality. However, 
many more of you will undoubtedly 
find comfort in the episode lhat will 
show you thai we are all affected by 
Ellen's "coming out" because we all 
know people who are gay — whether 
we realize it or nou 

We know that homophobia will 
continue to exist, but hopefully 
shows like "Ellen" will show many 
of you that homosexuals are not 
very different from heterosexuals 
Homophobics need to remember 
that homosexuals are humans first. 
So while some urge you not to 
watch the "coming out" episode of 
"Ellen," we urge you to "live and let 
live." Il won't kill you 



Letter to the Editor 



Affirmative Action has problems 

Nevertheless, usually these laws 
cannot be described in a few flowery 
sentences. These laws can lake ihe 
form of hundreds of pages In ihe 
enforcing of these laws much mean- 
ing quickly gets lost or changed. 

Being much older than Ms. 
Robinson, I have bad the opportuni- 
ty lo be involved in some executive 
decisions. I have seen the company 
lawyer show up and go into great 
detail on how 10 use these laws to 
the company's advantage and how 
by saying this instead of lhat and by 
changing this or lhat label they can 
get around ihe law. My advice to 
you Ms. Robinson is don't be 
impressed by these laws until you 
read all the fine print and actually 
see these laws in use. I have and 
they do not impress me. Affirmative 
Action in use is not living up to its 
hype and should be replaced with 
something belter. 



To the editor 

Since returning 10 school I have 
enjoyed reading your paper. It's a ut- 
ile more liberal ihan I am. Reading 
somebody else's poinl of view was 
always interesting. I read the paper 
on March 27 and for the firs! lime 
1 look offense. The column I look 
offense to was Ihe one regarding 
Affirmative Action written by Ms. 
Robinson. 

Like Ms. Robinson, and mosl 
Americans, 1 loo believe lhat racial 
discrimination is wrong and should 
be stopped wherever il shows it's 
face. Nevertheless, like most prob- 
lems, ibere is always more than one 
solution. I reseni being called a 
caveman, selfish, ignorant and un- 
American because I may noi sub- 
scribe lo your solution. 

Like most liberals, you appear lo 
gel some warm-fuzzy feeling when 
they pass a law lhat agrees with iheir 
point of view. Many of ihese laws, 
on face, sound very righteous.

IPSGA candidates analyze their campaigns 

President-elect introduces goals 

We, pt The Communicator, have asked the three candidates who ran for student body president to evaluate their campaign. We asked ihem 
specifically to address their strengths and weaknesses and what they learned from the campaign. We asked president elect, Kevin Orthman, to 
introduce himself to the student body by clarifying his goals for the future year. 

Gino Burgess replied, however Diana Sir Louis was asked but declined to answer.

Let it be said- 

The Communicator extends a sincere 
welcome to any and all members of the 
student body who are interested in work- 
ing for DTFW's student newspaper. We 
are looking for students with diverse 
backgrounds and from all majors to par- 
ticipate in all sections of the paper. 
Experience is not necessary. Whether 
you are a writer, artist, photographer, or 
have an opinion about sornetbing, be 
assured that your participation will be 
appreciated and will make a difference. 



major, etc. The majority of students 
did not base their decisions on expe- 
rience or whai the candidates would 
do for them if elected. This was 
clearly evident when ihe least expe- 
rienced presidential candidate -- 
who bad no solid platform - was 
elected. I believe that in the end, ihe 
women presidential candidates splii 
the female vote while die majority 
of male students who voted elected 
the only male presidential candidate. 

Keeping the above in mind, it is 
interesting lo note some of the 
"political games" thai were played 
this year in attempts to try to keep 
me from running and from getting 
elected Since the beginning of (he 
Spring semester there have been 
numerous rumors flying around 
about my "alleged misconduci" and 
as a result four attempts were made 
to "impeach me." lis interesting 
because these charges, illegal inves- 
tigations and "witch hunts" all took 
place approximately ihe five weeks 
prior to students voting. 

When these endeavors failed, 
new games started. First, the cam- 
paign manager of one of Ihe candi- 
date teams ensured that 1 was cut out 
of penineni information loops so 
that 1 could not be involved in nego- 
tiations dealing with the parking fee 
and sludent service fee and held cer- 
tain meetings that I would normally 
be pan of without my knowledge. 
Nexi. unknown individuals were 
launching false complaints lo the 
election board -- which investigated 
these allegations and found the com- 
plaints unsubstantiated. 

Finally, by not running as pan of 
a ticket or team, I was voluntarily 
disadvantaged I had 1/3 the money 
available to me to spend and lost 
several bours of campaigning due to 
attending class. (Running with a 
ticket allows you lo attend class 
while your colleagues campaign for 
all of you.) 

Additionally. I was unable to 
attend the debate, which left me 
wide open to oiher candidates per- 
sonal attacks on bow I was "not ded- 
icated" lo the students of IPFW, 



educate ourselves for the betterment 
of ourselves. Why not work together 
to make each other's ride through 
this more comfortable, enjoyable 
and productive? 

Wbai about the people who 
aren't involved in any student orga- 
nization? Believe it or not, you have 
a voice in this also. All Indiana- 
Purdue Student Government 
Association meetings are open to 
whoever wishes to attend. These 
meetings take place, throughout my 
administration, on the first Monday 
of every month. 

You also will find yourselves 
noticing an increased amount of 
receptiveness lo your ideas and I 
encourage anyone to stop by my 



Ironically, the individuals 
responsible for ibese personal 
attacks e-mailed me after the debate 
and accused me of running a nega- 
tive campaign, although my cam- 
paign was clearly factual and posi- 
tive as it highlighted my strengths 
and achievements. 

In an afterthought. I was inter- 
viewed by The Communicator a 
week before ihe elections and was 
asked the question why did I want to 
be student body president I told the 
interviewer that someday I might go 
into politics, but 1 wanted to learn 
more about the political beast to see 
if I could manage it 

Although I did not win the elec- 
tion, I did come out of the election 
as a winner because I achieved two 
of my personal objectives; lo run a 
clean campaign no mailer bow frus- 
trating and to gain insight into the 
world of politics 



Many student groups have offered 
me positions in their sludent organi- 
zations as members, executives, 
paid staff, eic. I may decide to stay 
in students government. I might start 
my own student organization. I 
might do a practicum in my major 1 
might just concentrate on school. 
The only thing I do know is lhat 
my plans for this semester include 
a concentrated effort in school and 
continuing out my term in stu- 
dents government. 

What should students expect out 
of the president-elect? 

This is a difficult question to 
answer, partly because I myself am 
not sure and panly because the vast 
majority of students do not know or 
understand bow IPSGA works, 
internally or externally. 

First, I Ihink Kevin Orthman 
should be congratulated on winning 
ihe election and commended for 
being bold enough to identify that 
ibis campus has problems and that 
the current sludent government has 
been ineffective in dealing with 



office to share them with me. 

My belief is thai I am here as a 
service for all students to utilize. 
Also you will find thai I believe in 
an open means of communication 
between students, the administration 
and the government on campus. 
Every other Thursday, I plan on 
briefing the student body in The 
Communicator in a forum spot ded- 
icated to bringing the students a 
greater sense of the happenings in 
Sludent Government. 

loin us ! I encourage your partic- 
ipation and suggestions as we march 
ihrougb the next two semesters here 
at IPFW. Stand up and recognize Ihe 
changes we are about to embark 
upon as we work for you next year. 



these problems. 

At the time of elections, his 
platform consisted of bringing "big 
campus life" to ihe IPFW campus 
and making much needed improve- 
ments on the campus. 

From my prior experience, I 
think Kevin is going to have a diffi- 
cult, although not impossible, lime 
bringing "big campus life" to IPFW. 
I base this on the fact that, as far as I 
know, he has not defined what 
exactly is "big campus life." He 
doesn't have a concrete plan of 
how to get it here to IPFW, nor 
has be set a standard by which he 
can measure whether or not he has 
accomplished this goal. 

I really can not speculate on the 
other pan of his platform because 
making improvements on campus is 
very vague. Furthermore, it can be a 
huge undertaking, and these 
improvements may not be possible 
to attain during a one year term or 
may noi be something tangible thai 
the students can regard as an accom- 
plishment Another speculation 
could be thai Kevin chose to be 
vague about what improvements he 
would make on campus and perhaps 
will be using the platforms of his 
losing colleagues as guidance during 
bis presidency. 

How can students get involved? 

I have always advocated for 
students to get involved because I 
believe that a students government 
is only as strong as its students 
and as weak as iis leaders. There 
are primarily five ways students 
can gel involved: (1.) petition to be 
a member of Senate, (2) petition 
to be a member of the Student 
Activities Board (SAB), (3) 
request to be appointed to a uni- 
versity commiltee as a presidential 
aid, (4) request to be a Senate 
Volunteer, known as Senatorial 
Representatives, or (5) request to 
be a volunteer to SAB. 

To be a member of Senate or 
SAB, you must have a 2.0 accu- 
mulative GPA and obtain 50 sig- 
natures on a petition. Petitions are 
available in ihe office of IPSGA 
located in Walb 225.

Letting go: Jeremy Ecen6arger 



Questioning police authority 




Several 
unpleasant inci- 
dents have taken 
place within 
police depart- 
ments across the 
country. 
Whether these 
incidents are 
true seems lo be 
questionable 
For me, I guess the real question lies 
in whether we can really trust our 
police forces. 

In current times, it seems like 
police officers arc losing their pow- 
ers rather than gaining ibem 
Perhaps, they were given too much 
authority in the beginning. Or 
maybe tbey have taken advan- 
tage of their positions. 

The line between a good and bad 
cop seems very narrow. Perhaps 
their power over the general public 
is a bit too strong Based on person- 
al relations, there are cops who 
uphold the law by the book and 
with an open mind. Nevertheless, 
there are a select few who seem to 
take the law upon themselves and 
deliver it as they please. 

Locally, cops are being accused 
of harassing and beating African- 
Americans. The entire police depart- 
ment is under investigation because 
of complaints received by numerous 
Fort Wayne residents. These resi- 
dents want the police chief Neil 
Moore fired and the rest of the 
department put under review. 

Recently the Supreme Court is 
reviewing a new policy called the 
"no knock" policy, in which police 
officers may be given the right to 
enter a borne without any use of a 
search warrant. Suspicions are the 
only thing the cop needs Do people 
really think this is OK? I surely hope 
not. Lei's think about it 

Why do children want to become 
police officers in the first place 1 Is it 
that they love danger, like working 
with guns, desire combat or want to 
help save the world? Even though 
many police officers may not admit 
it, they do it because ihey love 
action and want authority. 

While millions of people apply 
for a position on a police force each 
year, only a select few are admitted 
So, while there may be 10 



open in a particular city, there are 
usually hundreds applying for them. 
What is the chance that officials will 
pick the right ten? I believe that it's 
highly unlikely. 

On the other hand, police officers 
deserve some respect. After all, most 
of tbem put their lives on the line to 
uphold the law People must remem- 
ber to separate their judgments of 
the police force from the informa- 
tion they often see or hear in the 
mass media. They need lo be viewed 
on a personal basis, rather than as a 
whole. Like anything, where there's 
a good one, there's a bad one 

That is exactly what the Fort 
Wayne investigation is trying to 
find. Officials want to weed out the 
bad seeds and encourage the good 
ones. Hoping to, once again, 
bring back a positive image of 
the police force. 

Nevertheless, it is the moments in 
history, like the beating of Rodney 
King, that give members of society 



their bad views of cops We trust 
them to protect our homes, and, 
more frequently than ever, they're 
only making mistakes. They are hit- 
ting the wrong people, stealing the 
wrong things and saying the wrong 
words. Basically, they are running 
out of excuses. 

Many of these so-called "uphold- 
ers of the law" believe that all they 
need is a little strength, a gun and a 
badge to keep people in line On the 
contrary, that is not all the position 
entails. It requires all officers to be 
unbiased, friendly and fair. No test 
can grade you along this scale, the 
real answers lie in experience 

So. let me warn all police offi- 
cers You may complete all the nec- 
essary psychological, physical and 
drug tests, but that does not qualify 
you as being a cop that is automati- 
cally trusted Trust is earned by first 
knowing the taw. secondly by 
upholding the law and, last, by fol- 
lowing it yourselves.

"His expectations are high," Priedilis said, "but 1

"He bas taught me that in order to be successful, you

For a man who didn'i want to have anything to do a

well. He has participaied in five Olympic Festivals,

Senior shines in victory 



by Scott Warden 
Sports Editor 

As IPFW men's volleyball 
coach Amie Ball held ihe micro- 
phone between the second and third 
games of ihe Volleydons' match 
against No. II Lewis on Saturday, 
he spoke of senior leadership. It 
was, after all, Senior Night. 

"I want to thank Brad [Priedilisl 
for the numerous contributions that 
he has made to our program," said 
Ball, who honored Mike Tcr Molen 
along with Prieditis 

Ball couldn't have predicted the 
contributions to the program that 
Pricditis was about (o make against 
the Flyers. 

After blowing out his knee two 
years ago, Priedilis underwent total 
reconstructive surgery and has been 
struggling this season. He won't 
deny that fact, and has even fessed- 
up to it on occasion. But in 
Saturday night's home victory over 
Lewis, the senior swing hitter 
shined — on Senior Night nonethe- 
less. 

The 13th-ranked Volleydons 
upset the Flyers in five games 15- 
17, 15-13. 154, 9-15 and 17-15. 
With the victory,, the Dons 
unproved to 16-8, 13-3 in Great 
Lakes Valley Conference play. 

After splitting the first two 
games. Ball's words must have 
sparked something in Priedilis and 
his teammates. In the third game. 
the 'Dons nailed 29 kills and 
chalked up only one error as they hit 



Facing a 2-1 deficit in the match 
and 5-4 in the fourth game, Lewis 
rattled off five-straight points to 
take a four-point lead. IPFW cut the 
Flyers' lead to 9-10. but Lewis again 
rallied, scoring the final five points 
to force a fifth game 



Dons led 13-11

the pass. It may have been routine, 
but Priedilis botched it. The ball hii 
the side of his right arm and skidded 
across Ihe floor. The Flyers had their 
first lead of the game. 

"I can't believe that happened," 
said Prieditis. "I had that bail lined 
up and I must have jusi taken my 
eyes off of it right at the lasl sec- 
ond." 

After a net violation was whis- 
ded on Lewis to knot the score at 14, 
Prieditis redeemed himself. Leaping 
with arms extended, Priedilis 
blocked an almost sure Flyer point, 
sending the ball straight down and 
inbounds. As he landed, he pumped 



62 percent for ihe game. Prieditis his fist and sent the 600 fans in

for us," Prieditis said. "They had the 
advaniage in the rally game and we 
needed to gel back to even I'm jusi 
glad that I could make up for the 
pass that 1 missed." 

On the next serve, Priedilis 
recorded his final kill of the match. 
The lead thai he single-handedly 
squandered away, he single-hand- 
edly brought back. 

"This is definitely one of my 
besi games of the year," said 
Prieditis. "I've been showing a 
mediocre performance through mosl 
of the season, but now my play has 
sinned to pick up a liltle bit and I'm 
looking forward to keeping the 
momentum going." 

"I think that this was Brad's besi 
match of Ihe year." said Ball. "It was 
really fitting ihat we were able to 
come out and win after he shanked 
lhai serve at the end. I thought that 
he played really hard and kept a real 
good leadership role on the floor," 

The 'Dons will need all of ihe 
leadership they can gel a* they pre- 
pare for Saturday's opening round of 
the Midwestern Iniercollegiaie 
Volleyball Association IbumamenL 

Two assets dial the Volleydons 
have going for them are momentum 
;uid confidence. 

"1 don't know how to give 
them any more [confidence]," said 
Ball "You get confidence by win- 
ning big matches, and now we've 
won two of the last three week- 
ends." 

"We're peaking at the right 
time." said Prieditis. "You could- 
n't ask for more than that." 

After all. ii was Senior Night 
You can'i ask for more than ihat.

Last week in a letter to the editor enti- 
tled, "Top officials hypocritical toward stu- 
dents," written by J.D Barker, the fourth 
paragraph contained a mistake. The paper 
printed, "On one hand, we seem to have a 
minority student who makes unsubstantiat- 
ed claims against a non-ienured professor 
and gets nothing." 

It should have read, "On one band we 
seem to have a minority student who 
makes unsubstantiated claims against a 
non-tenured professor and gets $10,000. 
On the other hand, we have a non-minori- 
ty student who makes substantiated claims 
against a tenured professor and gets noth- 
ing. Does this sound like equal treatment 
for all students?" 

We apologize for any inconvenience 
(his may have caused
