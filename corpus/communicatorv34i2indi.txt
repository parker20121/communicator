West Nile: It's not just a branch 
off the river in Egypt, anymore 



It wasn't long ago, mosquitoes 
were a summer and fall pest. 

They were an annoyance that 
were slapped away as they pricked 
and suckled human flesh. 

Some people, like Minnesota 
residents, had the insect as an unof- 
ficial mascot. 

T-shirts would bare the image 
of the bug, surrounded by the text 
"Minnesota State Bird." 

That wasn't long ago. 

Now, trucks are sent out 
throughout the Midwest to spray 
pesticides to neutralize the bug 
before they fly. 

That's because - when they fly 
- they tend to contract West Nile 
virus from birds they also prick 
and suckle. 

And when they then feed 
from humans, they spread the 

In 2002, according to the Center 
for Disease Control, hundreds 
throughout the United States died 
because of West Nile. 

The Center for Disease Control 
reports the first known case of West 
Nile in a-human was in 1999. 

It has spread fast - since that 
year when it was first reported in 
New York, West Nile has been 
found in 44 states. 

Over 4,100 people contracted 
West Nile in 2002. There were 284 
deaths, the CDC states. 

Friday, Allen County officials 
announced a local resident had 
possibly acquired West Nile virus. 

After last summer and fall's out- 
break of cases, this year has so far 



been less prominent. 

After the Friday i 
Allen County officials stated they 
would spray adulticide. 

"Spraying will be conducted in a 
radius of approximately one-half 
mile around the residence of the 
probable case of West Nile virus," a 
release from the Allen County 
Department of Health said. 

The area involved included por- 
tions of Washington and St. Joe 
Townships. 

The health department said it 
lies within the streets east of 
Kentucky and Woodrow avenues; 
north of East State Blvd., west of 
Rolston Street; and south of 
Ferguson Avenue, St. Joe River 
Drive, Kirkwood Drive, Crescent 
Avenue and Merivale Street. 

Thus far, IPFW has escaped any 
cases of West Nile, according to 
IPFW/Parkview Health &amp; 
Wellness Clinic nurse Cheryl 
Erickson. 

Officials haven't had much 
contact with tht 
she said. 

"There hasn't been that much or 
it right now," she said. 

Last year was much different 
Erickson added. 

Partially, that could be due tc. 
the weather. 

While there were fears of Wesf 
Nile becoming an epidemic this 
summer with the floods of 2003, 
the temperatures have assisted. 

"Last year, it was earlier in the

If the weather stays cool, we're not 
going to have to worry about it. 
The mosquitoes aren't as lively," 
Erickson mentioned. 



Drain Standing Water 

Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing waler. Limit the number of places 

around your home for mosquitoes to breed by getting rid of items that 

hold water. 

Install or Repair Screens 

Some mosquitoes like to come indoors. Keep them outside by having 

well-fitting screens on both windows .nid doors Offer to help neighbors 

whose screens might be in bad shape

Hit and run report under investigation 



The IPFW police are looking for 
leads in a report of a hit-and-run 
incident involving a bicyclist and a 
truck during the fii 

The incident, which reportedly 



happened on Tuesday, August 28, 
apparently occurred about 24 
hours before then. 

Police say an Ivy Tech student 
claims he had been riding his bike 
on IPFW's roads. He said a red 
* or truck waved him through an inter- 
After being waved through, the 



bicyclist said he heard the truck's 
engine rev, and his bike was struck 
from behind - throwing him off 
the bicycle. 

Following the incident, he went 
to classes at Ivy Tech. 

About a day later, he reported 
the situation to the IPFW police. 
He was unable to recall any identi- 



fying information about the vehicle 
other that it was a red truck. Police 
are unsure why he wailed for a day 
before reporting fhe incident. 

Anyone with any information 
on the incident should contact the 
IPFW police department, 

The number for the department 
is 481-6827. On campus, it is 6827.

So you think you' re unique? 

Well, so are the rest of us. 

And now, all of us have at least t 



' thing i 



And while all of us have uniqueness through- 
out our individualism, be it via our DNA struc- 
ture or the transcendent soul of our life, we also 
have common grounds with others. 

It's good to celebrate our differences, but it is 
also important to grow our support structure 
around us - with people who have similar hob- 
bies, beliefs and backgrounds. 

Wednesday and Thursday, the IPFW Student 
Life Office is holding the Student Organization 
Fair. About one-third of the over 90 organiza- 
tions will be represented that day - and it will 
give you an opportunity to find peers more speci- 
fied than year-in-school. 

Clubs as diverse as the Accounting Society; 
Agriculture, Forestry &amp; Pre-Vet Club; the 



American Choral Directors Association', and the 
American Medical Student Association — and 
those are just the first four listed at the Student 
Life website. 

Check out that site, and you '11 probably be able 
to find a group in which you can become a mem- 
ber. It is an opportunity to become involved - not 
just with school, but with others. How many 
times have we been told that college is supposed to 
be the time of our lives ■- the time to meet people 
who will become lifelong fiends? Even lifelong 
romances. 

While this week is the recruiting fair for about 
a third of the groups, they are always looking for 
new membership. We will eventually all leave 
these buildings and grounds — but we will take 
our friendships with us. These groups are an 
opportunity to bring us together - not under the 
auspices of IPFW, or athletics or academics, but 
under more specific beliefs, hobbies, backgrounds. 



Editorial 



Always under construction 



We'd like to apologize for the first issue of The 
Communicator this year - it wasn't perfect 

Not that it was "apxeceofs**t," as one person 
lamented anonymously. There were a handful of 
factual errors, some grammatical farts and a larg- 
er handful of design burps that mainly the jour- 
nalism-minded of us noticed. 

But our goal even/ iveek is to improve -- our 
content and our design. 

Following publication, we ripped the paper 
apart on our own. The Thursday night session 
wasn't a time when we mocked each other. We 
just had a time when we gave constructive criti- 
cism: - -Collectively, we have pretty strong self- 



esteem, so debuting the merits of a better newspa- 
per has less to do with personal struggles and 
more to do with professional desires. 

Constant improvement is our goal. There is 
always going to be an occasional problem. Any 
newspaper that doesn't have a "Corrections" col- 
umn is living in denial. But improvement is for 
what we strive. Living life any other way is to 
slip into short-term sporadic setbacks that add up 
to long-term disappointment. 

We will continue to try to improve. Partly for 
our readers - because they are important. But 
mainly for ourselves ... because if we improve 
ourselves, our readers will hopefully take notice. 



First walk on campus 



By Josh Vargas, freshman 

IVlaybe it'&gt; the giant buildings that surround you when you first 
walk on campus. Or maybe it is the seemingly endless number of 
'e that is comparable to that of biblical proportions. But wlmi 
I arrived at campus for my first day. I felt as though I must luwe 
upset the gods of incoming freshmen attending IPFW. 

I felt so small and scared. Of course, my 57, 140-pound 

Sfoture doesn't exactly help calm these feelings, but, whatever hap- 

ned to the warm- fuzzy feeling tliat is supposed to embrace you 

you start your experience at IPFW? 

I must have missed the warm-and-fuzzy-feeling-train 
somewhere along my awesome trek from Ligonier to Fort Wayne. 

Maybe the freshmen gods thought the}/ would Ixave a little 
'ii with one of their freshmen. "Let's pick one," the}/ probably 
lid. So one of them probably closed their eyes, stuck out a finger 
id waited to see 'whom it would land on. It just so happened that 
■e giant extremity, found its way toioards me. 

Now, I thought that maybe I could catch a break and maybe 
even the warm-and-fuzzy-feeling-train at my first class, but I was 
wrong. 

You enter your class anticipating a group of peers waiting 
to make a new friend or study buddy, but I xuas wrong. All I 
were kids with all their materials, sitting quietly awaiting the 
instructor. The]/ looked as though they had paid a substantial 
amount of money just to be there, and they weren't going to mess 
around. It was like they were preparing for the rest of their lives 
toward their careers or something. 

Don't get me wrong, this campus is beautiful, and tlve 
activities arc endless. But maybe the]/ should start 
freshmen program. Have an older, experienced student hang out 
and talk with any trembling, wide-eyed, knee-knocking freshman 
that fuis lost his or her way. Oh, if you did see someone like tliat 
on the first day, tlwt was probably me. 

I feel that in time, this fear will go mvay. Like I said, this 
place is beautiful and the atmosphere is great. I'm thinking tliat all 
that fear was just first-day jitters that lasted a few more weeks than 
it should have. Wlio knows? 

For now, I think I'll continue to wait for the warm-and- 
fuzzy-train to arrive, and Iwpefully, I'll get to talk to the dude that 
pointed me out as the Inch/ winner of the "Torture the 
From The Heavens Szueepstakes." Whatever. 



The Communicator 
The Corrections 
The Column 

The Communicator made some errors in our first issue. 

An advertisement for Student Activities Board mistak- 
enly said a speaker was going to discuss JEF. 

That speaker, John Gordon, is actually speaking of the 
JFK assassination on Sept, 24. 

An article on student organizations holding a fair did 
not list a time for the Organization Fair. It is being held 
Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and Thursday from 4 to 6 
p.m. 

The article also misstated -- saying Zombie Campaign is 
a game. Zombie campaign is a scenario in Dungeons &amp; 
Dragons III Edition. 

The article on SAB indicated SAB is responsible for 
bringing the Harlem Globetrotters to play against IPFW 
men's basketball in November. That is an Athletic 
Department's event. 

A line from a sports column on college football predic- 
tions was cut. More information on that prediction can be 
found on Page 9. 

The Communicator apologizes for the errors.

Pagan Pride Day hopes 
to bring understanding 



On September 6th, the City of 
Churches is due to receive a new 
test in religious tolerance. From 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m., the IPFW Pagan 
Student Alliance and the Fort 
Wayne Pagan Alliance are co-spon- 
soring the first Pagan Pride day at 
IPFW. Shawn Hodell, president 
and founder of the Pagan Student 
Alliance, calls the event "a chance 
for pagans to get together and meet 
people of like mind." 

There are several activities 
planned throughout the day. 
Merchants from local stores such as 
Spirit Healing will be on-hand 
selling massages, crystals, 
candles, and other 
physical products. 

Rituals scheduled 
to take place include 
chanting circles, 

drumming, and a 
hand fast, the equiva- 
lent of a pagan wed 
ding. Pagan ar 

layperson alike are invited 
to take part in these rituals, 
special ritual, written by one of the 
Committee members, is planned 
for closing ceremonies. 

Information booths will be on hand 
to provide facts about the various 
pagan faiths and the pagan com- 
munity in Fort Wayne. Hodell 
comments that "We're basically 
here as information pools." 

Elizabeth Markley, local coordi- 
nator of the event, summarizes the 
definition of Pagan as a person 
who acknowledges the possibility 
of polytheistic beliefs and holds a 
deep respect for the earth as a 
whole. "In paganism,/ you value 
everything on the earth- every 
plant, bug and animal has worth." 

However, the organizers of 
Pagan Pride day are not unaware 
of the possible reaction from the 
community. While the PSA hopes 
for the best, they are not taking any 
chances. 

The projected turnout for the 
event is between one hundred and 
fifty and two hundred people. 
Markley does not expect a major 
confrontation. "The churches we 
have here are much more peaceful 
than other cities," she commented. 




However, "due to the fact there 
are always protesters at Pagan 
Pride day, surely somebody will." 
Event organizers have coordinated 
with campus police and their own 
security to ensure that event atten- 
dees will be protected, and 
Markley hopes that this will ensure 
activities will commence "as peace- 
fully and calmly as possible." 

The Pagan Student Alliance has 
existed since the fall of 2000 and 
was founded, according to their 
IPFW website, "for the spiritual 
growth and support of local Pagan 
students, other local Pagans and is 
open to all faiths and traditions." 
Between 15 and 20 students 
ularly on 

Wednesday nights to 
share their beliefs 
and customs in the 
Pagan faiths. 
Hodell considers 
IPFW to be 
accepting of the 
PSA, and the 
organization has 

th the college. 

Neither the PSA 
nor the FWPA actively recruit for 
new members. Hodell comments 
that "(w]e don't proselytize our 
beliefs to people ... we realize our 
paths are not for everyone, because 
of the nature of our beliefs." 
Markley echoes the sentiment, not- 
ing "we do not believe in forcing 
our beliefs in anyone." Her organi- 
zation's philosophy is to "let them 

The makeup of the PSA is very 
diverse, and Hodell lauds this vari- 
ety. "It's nice that we have such a 
diversity. We can cover so many 
topics [in our meetings)." 

According to the PSA, the event 
is not planned as a protest but as 
their website claims "we are not 
organizing any sort of boycott, or 
uprising, but simply to get all of us 
together." 

When asked what one piece of 
information Hodell would like the 
community at large to know about 
Pagans, he commented "We're 
everyday people." By dispelling 
the sigma attached to the Pagan 
beliefs, the Hodell and the PSA 
hope "to change [to] where 'Pagan' 
is a good word."

Tlora' makes light of communism 



For two nights Only, the theatre 
community at IPFW sang and 

danced about lite, love, friendship 
and communism. That's right, no 
need to re-read that, it says com- 

Theplay is set during the Great 
Depression and Flora Meszaros 
(fane Rebekah Frazier), a young 
fashion illustrator, tinds herself in 
the waiting room of a high scale 
department store looking for a job, 

While waiting on the chance to 
show her work, she meets Harry 
Toukarian (Patrick Fruchey), a 
handsome young artist with a 
memorable stuttering problem, 
also in search of a job. 

Flora tells Harry about her stu- 
dio and invites him to rent out 
space and become part of her stu- 
dio family. As she tells him about 
the other renters, we are intro- 
duced to them one by one. 

Willy (Matthew Pedersen), a 
struggling clarinetist, Maggie 
(Kasey Foster) and Kenny (lake 
Stackhouse) &lt;i young dancing cou- 
ple, Elsa (Jenn Nickell) a seam- 
stress and Mr. Weiss (Kirby Vol/) a 
jeweler forced to shut down his 
store due to the current economk

of the Communist party and 
invites her to become a member as 
well. Flora signs up and attends 
her first meeting and has a run-in 
with the stubborn-headed and 
trouble-making Comrade 

Charlotte (Melissa Dowty). Flora 
and Charlotte butt heads from the 
beginning and their hatred for 
each other grows as it becomes 
obvious that they both are interest- 
ed in the lovable artist. 

Flora was given a job by the 
demanding Mr Stanley (Jason 
Graf) and has to compromise her 
own artistic beliefs to bend to the 
will of her employer. 



and Harry, she has to bena her 

own values, she wants to do what 
she is told, but she realizes that her 
own independent beliefs are more 
important to her. She battles with 
losing Harry when she stands up 
for herself and Ira/ier showed an 
incredible range of emotions when 
she realized she had sacrificed her 
rel.il ion ship with Harry to do 
what she knew was right. 

The set was minimal but 
proved to be very effective. With a 
handful of pieces, the cast and 
crew of "Flora" took us from the 
bare bones of a studio of strug- 
gling citizens, to the office of a 
high-end department store. The 
supporting cast of Flora was very 
impressive. 



Staekluuise, as the young dancers, 
amazed the audience not only 
with their on-stage chemistry and 
timing, but with their dance 
moves as well. Their tap routine 
was one of the best to grace a Fort

Recent survey: student loan debt 
influences career, other choices 



{BUSINESS WIRE via COLLE- 
GIATE PRESSWIRE) A new sur- 
vey of recent college graduates 
indicates that high student loan 
s having .1 sigmlu.int impart 



the dec 



,any 



5 that 



post-graduate life - decis 

may have lasting affects on their 

career paths and financial health. 

The survey, released by 
Collegiate Funding Services, LLC 
(CFS), also shows a jump in the 
number of college graduates who 
are unprepared to make their 
monthly student loan payments 
when the first bills begin arriving 
this fa)). 

The "2003 CFS Flanning and 
Paying for Higher Education" sur- 
vey conducted by Harris 
Interactive paints a clear picture of 
the implications of student loan 
debt among college graduates. As 
tuitions rise, so does student loan 
debt -- more than half of college 
graduates (52%) report owing 
between SIO.OOO and $40,000 in 
student loans 

In addition, many are carrying 
credit card debt into their post- 
graduate years ~ a time when earn- 
ing power is traditionally at its 
lowest. 837c. of college graduates 
surveyed report making monthly 
credit card payments. 

More than half (55%) of college 
graduates said that student loan 
debt is making it difficult for them 
to fulfill their financial objectives. 

As a result, nearly a fifth (17%) 
have had to make tough choices in 
order to meet their student loan 
obligations - including decisions 
not to pursue careers they may 
have studied for in college. One in 
three college graduates (30%) said 
they took a job that paid more over 
a job they may have preferred in 
order to make more money. This is 



"These young people are increas- 
ingly entering the job market heav- 
ily encumbered with student loan 
and credit card debt, while trying 
to lind housing and establish them- 
selves financially," says ). Barry 
Morrow, CEO of CFS. 

"It's unfortunate that many feel 
they have no choice but to take a 
better paying job just to meet basic 
expenses,' he said. 

Morrow goes on to say that the 
long-term implications of such 
choices may extend beyond indi- 
vidual career paths. "If increasing 
numbers of graduates who may 
have aspired to teaching or public 
service careers, for example, lorgo 
these options because they simply 
can t afford the lower entry-level 
pay scales, employee shortages in 
these important fields may become 

Of course, having to take a sec- 
ond-choice job, while not ideal, 
may be a far better prospect than 
that faced by many who've been 
unable to secure adequate employ- 
ment at all. 

Not surprisingly, given current 
economic conditions and the weak 
job market, more than one in three 
college graduates (34%) said they 
were unprepared to make their 
first monthly student loan pay- 
ment that arrived at the end of the 
"grace period"- the six-month 
"payment-tree" period on federal 
student loans following gradua- 

This is a significant increase 
over a survey conducted last year. 
in which only one in five respon- 
dents (19%) reported that they 
were unprepared to make pay- 






CFS 



survey that found one in five of 
those surveyed (20%) took a sec- 
ond-choice job to make ends meet. 



Unfortunately, awareness of the 
Federal Consolidation Loan 
Program, which was enacted by 
Congress to make student loan 
repayment more manageable, 
remains low. Of recent graduates, 
more than half (53%) were 



of the program. This is 
almost identical to the findings of 
last year's CFS survey, which 
found 54% of respondents 
unaware of the Federal 
Consolidation Loan Program. 

Under the program, student 
loan borrowers can take advantage 
of today's historically low interest 
rates by consolidating their exist- 
ing variable rate federal student 
loans into a single fixed interest 
rate loan with extended payment 
terms that can slash monthly pay- 
ments by up to 54% - or up to 58% 
if borrowers consolidate before 
their grace period ends. Grace bor- 
rowers can lock-in a rate of up to 
0.6% lower than if they wait to con- 
solidate once their loan enters 
repayment, thereby benefiting 
from lower monthly payments and 
significant interest savings over the 
life of the loan. 

The majority of the class of 2003 
will be entering repayment on their 
federal student loans in November, 
so in order to secure their consoli- 
dation loan at the lowest possible 
interest rate, they must act by late 
September or early October, at the 
latest. 

' Lack of effective debt manage- 
ment is significant in the long term 
because it undermines graduates 
efforts to save for their future 
goals, including retirement, mak- 
ing it difficult for them to begin 
building a nest egg early in their 
adult life. 

Three out of four college gradu- 
ates surveyed (75%) said monthly 
student loan payments prevents or 
delays them from saving money, 
and 44% said their payment pre- 
vents or delays them from con- 
tributing to 401{k) or other retire- 
ment savings programs. 

According to Morrow, 

"Proactively managing debt is cru- 
cial in reducing lasting negative 
effects on the careers and finances 
of recent college graduates."

Masto Mullet pontificates of college football 



Yeap, that's my name. See it, 
laugh at it, point at it; tell your 
friends about it. I don't care. 

Not only is this my haircut, but 
my way of life. 

With my mullet, I will outsmart 
all sports writers, editors, and talk- 
ing heads. This thing flows in the 
wind because I know my stuff. As 
long as I keep predicting games, 
players, conferences, and awards 
correctly, I will not cut it. 

Good luck to Sports Editor Nick 
West, Editor Scott Lawson, or any 
other IPFW Communicator mem- 
ber who wants to go one on one 
with me. My sports smarts and 
experience will torch them all. 

While I'm on the topic of Sports 
Editor West, didn't he totally forget 
a line to one of his predictions? Or

Editor Lawson who

Clayton and 

Bevery Henderson to...." To what 

Mr. West? To dance with? To beat 

up? Or how about to grow mullets 

with? 

Didn't he also predict the 
Washington-Ohio State game 
wrong? Washington in an upset?! 
PUHLEASE! They got torched by 
Ohio State! AND he predicted the 



Tigers to beat the Trojans! Once 
again, wrong. 

Take a look West, read- 
ers, enthusiasts, and soon- 
to-be-fans, here are my 
predictions for this week- 
ends' big college games 
and players. Oklahoma at 
Alabama. 

The Mike Shula coaching 
era truly begins here. 
Alabama whooped on 
South Florida last weekend, but 
Oklahoma is the #1 team in the 
country. Go ahead; find a fault in 
Oklahoma's team. I dare you. 
Prediction: Oklahoma. 

Florida at Miami. A showdown 
in The Sunshine State. Last year, 
Miami destroyed Florida 41-16. 
This year, the Gators are minus Rex 



Buckeye Clarett overrated, hyped 



Grossman and Taylor Jacobs, look 
for them to struggle against the col- 
lege powerhouses all se.ison long. 
No other college team in the coun- 
try has as many players as Miami 
that are good enough to make it on 
an NFL roster right now. 
Prediction: Miami. 

Masto' Mullet's pick of the week- 
end: Maryland at Florida State. 
Maryland Showed their vulnerabil- 
ity when MAC team Northern 
Illinois beat them last Saturday. 
The MAC has been a powerhouse 
conference for how many years? 
Try none. Maryland isn't that good 
this year, and that's why it is easy 
to make this my pick of the week. 1 
can't lose. Prediction: Florida Slate. 
Masto' Mullet's game to watch: 
Colorado State at California. I'm a

sucker lor shootouts and big num- 
bers. If you are too, then watch this 
game. Last week, CSU put up 35 
points and 585 yards of offense 
while California had 34 and 411. 

Every Saturday, some stud puts 
up huge numbers. Watch for these 
guys to fall into that "stud" catego- 
ry. Florida State quarterback Chris 
Rix. He has two things in his cor- 
ner: The team's trust and

Did I miss something? Was seen the results. Clarett gave in to 
Ohio State running back Maurice the hype that was given him, the 
Clarett reinstated by the NCAA illusions of playing on Sundays, 
e before Ohio State's dom- and the allure of the life that is 
lived by a high-paid athlete. 

The guy is driving around a 
Navigator. As college students the 
closest we get to the driver's seat of 
our own Navigator is when one 
pulls up beside us as we are driv- 
ing and staring at it 
so much we nearly 
rear-end the person 
in front of us. 

Obviously, Clarett 
u'.is getting a bit of 
spending money to 
go along with his ali- 
ning back. 

Furthermore, he 
evidently walked 
out of a final last 
January before the 
title game and, 
instead of failing 
him and losing his 
eligibility to play in 
that game, the pro- 
d gave Clarett an 



mating 28-9 win over Washington 
last Saturday? 

Or, here is a wild thought, is 
there more to the defending nation- 
al champions than an overrated 
sophomore running back? Uh, 
questions answered. 

The Buckeyes did not win 
the national championship 
last season due to Clarett. 
They won it because of their 
defense (which gave up a 
whopping 7 yards on 24 car- 
ries on the ground on 
Saturday). The sophomore 
missed four games last sea- 
son to injury. He will miss at 
least that many this season . 
The NCAA has suspended 
Clarett after he filed some- 
what false police reports 
after his Lincoln Navigator 
was broken into. Funny how

aren't finding their

lege. Clarett sure isn't the first, and 
dotinilely will not be the last. 

The Buckeyes still would have 
won the national title last season 
without Clarett, they could still 
win it this season if Clarett is sus- 
pended for more than 3-4 games. 

He is overrated, overhyped, 
and overconfident. I didn't see the 
difference between active running 
backs Maurice Hall and Lydell 
Ross and inactive Maurice Clarett 
on Saturday, and neither did the 
Buckeyes. 

"We feel confident with the 
players we have that we can beat 
anybody in the country." Ohio 
State quarterback Craig Krenzel 
said after the win. 

Whoa, you mean one player

Support IPFW athletics 

Special to The Communicator 

IPFW wants you to become a member of our athletic program. 

Whether you are an athlete or not, you should come out and 
support the Mastodons in all their home events. Courtside seats 
are specially set aside for all students, even at the Coliseum. Just 
follow your way to the Tar Pit. IPFW is recruiting members to 
ensure the Tar Pit is jammed packed with rowdy supporters. 

"There is nothing like having a ton of fan support at a game," 
senior basketball guard Keion Henderson said. 

"The student section brings an important feature to the game, 
being the Sixth Man... Having good fan support helps bring the 
team into another state of mind on the court. The fans really help 
us out in some tough situations," Henderson added. 

Senior forward Jim Kessenich agrees. "The level of play 
always goes up when there are a bunch of rowdy fans cheering us 
on. The louder and noisier the fans are, the better advantage we 
hold over visiting teams," Kessenich said. 

IPFW has lined up several events for the students in the Tar 
Pit. Several giveaways and activities are already planned for the 
upcoming seasons, including giving away a big screen television. 

"This is a great opportunity for students to have fun and let 
loose outside the classroom. This season we have instituted a stu- 
dent reward system, and will be delivering a product the fans can 
really get behind," Brian Miller, director of promotion, said.
