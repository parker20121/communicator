University receives high ranking for 'academic reputation' 



by Gail Rulik-Crawford 
Editor 

IPF\V tcccnUy received a 2.9 raiing 
for "academic rcpuiaiion," placing il 
among Indiana's highest-ranked rcgioial 
campuses, in US News and World 
Rcprtn's "Best Colleges 1999." 

'"Bcsl Colleges" is an annua! ranking 
of ouislanding col- 
leges and universi- 
ties in ihe U.S. 

IPFW was 
listed in the fourth 
licr of tJie category 
"Regional 
Univcrsily- 
Mldwesi." 

IPFW's acad- 
emic ranking, based 
on a five-poini 
scale, also places 
the university above 
Ball State. Indiana 
Slate and lUPUl in 
the national rank- 




ings. 

The rankings, published in 
September, are based on repons from 
institutional presidents, provosts and 
admission directors. 

Among the regional universities. 
IPFW ranked well in several categories. 

IPFW has the largest percentage of 
full-time faculty, 75 percent, of the seven 
regional universities that responded to 
the report. 

The university's facully-to-student 
laiio was also one of the best ILsicd, ai an 
average of 1 5 students to each instructor. 

In a letter dated Sept. 25, Chancellor 
Michael Wartell also said thai die univer- 
sity compared "well with our peers in 
icims of graduation rales, average class 
sizes and average SAT scores." 

While the academic reputation of the 
university ranked high in the report, there 
were several areas that were ranked 
lower than regional universities. 

One area of concern with the rank- 
ings Ls IPFW's "freshman retention rate." 

At 42 percent, ii was the lowest of all 
regional and national universities in 
Indiana. 



lU Kokomo's freshman retention rate 
is 54 percent, lU Northwest's is 61 per- 
cent and lU South Bend's is 60 
percent. 

Wartcll's letter explained that 
IPFW's reponed retention rales are lower 
than the other schools because dierc are 
different methods of calculating retention 
rates used between the 
campuses. 

IPFW uses the calculation proce- 
dures outlined by the NCAA for Division 
II schcK&gt;ls, he said. 

"As a result, wc can count as 
'retained' only those students who begin 
as full-lime students and who return as 
full-time students. 

"We know from other studies that 
another 15 percent of our freshmen who 
begin as full-lime studenis will reium for 
their second year as part-time students," 
he explained. 

"This second group of freshmen is 
counted in the percentage of students 
'reiamcd' at all the other regional cam- 
puses, tliat do not offer Division II athlet- 
ics programs, 

■'If we add this 15 percent to ihc other 



42 percent shown for IPFW, our overall 
retention rate would be about the same as 
the rates shown for the odier campuses," 
Wartell continued. 

However, while the campus faces 
several challenges, such as "rel atively 
low stale appropriations per FTE [Full- 
Time Equivalent) student, reienlion and 
graduation rates which need improve- 
ment and the lack of campus activities 
more common on residential campuses," 
Wartell expressed that the university "can 
be proud of the exceptional educational 
opportunities available at IPFW." 

Wanell remained positive about the 
report's rankings. 

"We can work to improve our perfor- 
mance in all areas, knowing that we 
already serve our studenis well, and that 
any success we achieve results from the 
efforts of all university employees," 
Wanell concluded.

Professors

Work takes unusual 
study approach 

by Carrie Anne Leathers 
Chief Ueporler 

Using a new method to approach the study of 
violence, sociology professors Peter ladicola 
and Anson Shupe have fmished their book. 
"Violence. Inequality, and Human Freedom." 

"We moved beyond die usual approach to 
violence," Shupe said. 

"We're taking on civilizauon — it's a socio- 
logical book, but we draw on anthropology and 
history, as well," he added. 

Both professors will be presenting the 
book at Borders bookstore tomorrow at 1 p.m.

Forensics off to 
strong start 



by MLshanna Wood 

News Editor 

Dan Westrick. IPSGA senator 
and member of the forensics league, 
placed fifth in dramatic interpreta- 
tion at Purdue University's 
Forensics Tournament on Sept. 26, 

He competed against schools 
such as Indiana University, Ball 
Slate and Illinois State. 

These schools are considered to 
be some of the best forensic schools 
in the nation. 

Westrick performed a comical 
role of a depressed man from the 
play "Siobhan," by Sherry 
Anderson. 

"This was my breakout piece," 
Westrick said. 

Individuals compete in three 
categories of speech; 

I.) Interpretive, including poet- 
ry and prose drama: 2.) public 
speaking, including informative or 
persuasive speeches; and 3.) semi- 
jirepared, or "impromptu" speeches. 

Impromptu speeches are the 
most difficult because recipients 
have to ix: knowledgeable in current 
events. 

Students arc given a quote or 
question and are allotted seven min- 
utes to prepare a speech. 

Westrick will compete again on 
Oct. 23 and 24 at the Ball State tour. 

At Ball State. Westrick will 
attempt another victory with both 
an impromptu piece and an interpre- 
tive prose piece. 

"All tournaments are this way; 
we're up against Ihe best," said Sara 
Nichter, second year director of the 
forensics team and associate faculty 
of coirununicauon. 

In the early 1970s, IPFW had a 



nationally 
known foren- 
sics team. 

IPFW IS 




duo and impromptu. 

Currently there are 12 active 
members and 30 others who are 
interested in joining the team 

"We have four reluming mem- 
bers and yet we've been able to 
build a nice team with Hrsl timers 
for college competition. Twelve is 
big for what we've had in ihe past 
five years," Nichter said. 

On average, the team has four to 
five tournaments per semester 
depending on the amount of effort 
studenis are willing (o put forth; aca- 
demics come firsL 

Anyone who attends IPFW can 
join the team with a 2 grade point 
average or better. 

Nichter can be reached through 
the communication department at 
481-5425, 

On Feb. 13, the Forensics team 
will be competing in the Mastodon 
Stomp, at several campus buildings, 
from 8 a-m. to 8 p.m. 

"Dan got the team slaried off on 
Ihe right foot and we're looking 
toward a successful year," Nichter 
said. 



and Shupe 

used the unusual approach of analyzing not 
just the interpersonal aspects of why violence 
occurs, but also the institutional and systemic 
view of it. 

"We're trying to move up from just a per- 
son-lo-person view." Shupe said. "It's an over- 
all picture — political, family, religion am) sex- 
ual institutions." 

Shupe and ladicola did extensive research 
for ihc book. 

Many different forms of violence lead to 
death or injury of millions of people each year, 
not just in the terms of murder or rape. 

"The b«x&gt;k has an enormous amount of 
information in il," Shupe said. "It's to fill the 
gap — there's no oUier book like it." 

Both professors have been published in the 
past numerous times and are aln:ady looking 
towards Ihe future. 

"We're already thinking about doing a 
sequel on religious violence," Shupe said. 
"Peter and I work well logether." 



Lecture series brings feminist artist to campus 



by Carrie Anne Leathers 

Chtef Reptiner 

Since her first controversial work, 
"The Dinner Party." Judy Chicago 
has been an innovator of bodi an and 
the feminist movement. 

Monday. Oct. 19, at 7:30 p.m., 
she will be visiting IPFW in the Walb 
Ballroom to share her eKpcrience.s 
and work, 

"She was one of the main people 
who wa.s on the forefront of the femi- 
nist movement in ihe 70s," said 
Marilyn Bock-Tobolski, associate 
faculty of the dep;trtment of fine arts. 
'The Omnibus scries likes to 
bring m people dial are thinking, that 



have an open mind." said Dock- 
Tobolski. 

Many American museums felt 
threatened by Chicago's 'The Dinner 
Party" because portions of it were 
considered to represent the vagina. 

The purpose of the piece, howev- 
er, was not lo depict physical repre- 
sentations of the feinalc body, but 
raiher to depict an entire history of 
women and their various 
accomplishments. 

"Ihere are ail kinds of symbolic 
meanings in it," Dock-Tobolski said. 
"It's a women's history — diere were 
fantastic women throughout history 
that never got any recognition." 

Chicago began work on the pro- 
ject in 1974. She spent six years cre- 



ating the huge floor piece. 

The piece displays 39 place-set- 
tings, each representing a female who 
held significance in history or was a 
goddess. 

ITie piece required ihe aid of hun- 
dreds of volunteers and eventually 
toured six dilTerent countries for a 
total of 15 showings. 

Because the piece was so contro- 
versial, some of the showings in the 
United SLiies look place in warehous- 
es and other areas dial were rented out 
and prepared for the exhibit. 

ilie individually modeled and 
painted porcelain plates and the band- 
made tapestries repre.senting the dif- 
ferent lime periods were of immense 
size and required great care in trans- 



porting and setting up. 

Through her various works and 
projects. Chicago has aitempied to 
shed lighi on topics not always open- 
ly discus.sed, and in the case of birih. 
something often hidden by many 
cultures 

Overall, she has been a signifi- 
cant contributor to the feminist move- 
ment both for an, and in genera! for 
giving females, and the ideas associ- 
ated with females, positive 
recognition. 

Chicago's lecture is open to stu- 
dents, faculty, and the public. 

The lecture is free of ctiarge.

Topic: 

Rethinking the 
upcoming hohdays 

Our Verdict: 

The hoUdays are times 
to celebrate and not 

worry about the nega- 
tiS(^;!tllirigs in life. 



Everyone knows Uiai holidays arc 
limes for people lo gci logethcr wiih 
friends and family. 

Tlie fall sca.son is full of wonderful 
holidays, with Halloween and 
Thanksgiving being the most 
promineni. 

Recently some siaff members 
encoiinicR'd a siudeni who had a dif- 
ferent view of Uie fall holidays. 

The convcfsaiion in quesiion 
staned off by talking aboui how 
Halloween was jusi around the comer. 
Ii seemed weird ihai all the Chrisimas 
omamcnLs and things were already 
flooding (he slores. 

A few of us mentioned how 
Halloween is one of our favorite holi- 
days of the year. We talked at)oui how 
II is fun to get dressed up for parties 
and waith old honor movies. 

The siudcnt that we were talking 
with quickly became the "grinch who 
stole Halloween," 



The gtinch said thai Halloween 
was nothing but a "pagan" holiday 
meant for devil worshipers, and ii cor- 
rupLs our children and makes them 
bad. 

We sal (here for a minute with our 
eyes wide open. We didn't know what 
10, say (for once). 

We just never thought thai there 
was any harm in trick- or- treating, 
watching scary movies or going lo 
places that scare us. 

We conversed on the subject for a 
moment and came up with, '"What's 
wrong with having a 'pagan' holiday?'^' 

Most places arc lolercUit of boi^ 
Judeo-Chrisiian andpnlilical holidays, 
so what is wrong wilh a pagan ([f 
occult holiday. 

When we asked the grinch, all she 
really said is thai it was bad. She 
couldn't explain it. but it was bad. 

We then asked the grineh what she 
thought about Thanksgiving and 
Columbus Day. 

The grineh said that those are the 
two worst holidays of the year. She 
said thai all thai Columbus did was 
bring deaih to the Native Americans, 



and thai all dial Thanksgiving does is 
10 celebrate that. 

Well, we guess dial is one way you 
can look at it. However, we prefer lo 
put all of that behind us, because we 
didn't do those things. 

Please understand that we arc not 
irying to put down what this individual 
believes. 

We jusi do not ihmk thai we should 
be held accountable for what our 
ancestors did or didn'l do. 

The grinch and others have 

expressed a great dislike of 

Thanksgiving in, particular because of 

i.wljai the seidecs did.to^ the .Native 

Americans: ' ' . ■■■ ■ 

To us. Thanksgiving is a lime lo 
give thanks for what we have and for 
the things ihal have gone right for us. li 
is al.so a way to spend some time with 
friends and family. 

We know thai a lol of students jusi 
see Thanksgiving as a few days off 
from school. 

This year, however, try to think ol 
these holidays as a time for happiness 
and appreciate the things ihai are posi- 
tive in life. Don't be a grinch.

L^ere to 
the Editor 






To ihe Editor; 

[ just got done reading the fall 1998 
issue of "[PFW Alumni" and I'm 
steamed at ihc incredible hypocrisy and 
doubletalk this issue puis forward. 

First of all, in her leiier, Jennifer 
Bosk, alumni director, siams previous 
alumni office staff for the fact that she 
heard from them "only when they wanted 
a monetary donaiion." Yet nearly half of 
this magazine is devoied lo Ihe "Honor 
Roll of Donors" and a pilch lo give 
money! 

Second, Ms, Bosk says her previ- 
ous lack of info about IPFW alumni ben- 
efils "was also the fault of the alumni 
office." I'm so lired of hearing leaders 
downtalk previous siaff in order lo make 
ihemselves look beiier. 

Let's nol forget that IPFW got to be 
the great place it is not because of staff 
who've been there two years or so, but 
because of ihe faculty and staff who built 
the campus through years of commii- 
ment- The reason Jennifer Bosk has a 
good basis for her alumni board loday is 
because of ihe hard work her predeces- 
sor, Karen Chapman, did lo meet and 
motivate people lo serve, 

] served on the IPFW alumni board 



for five years and many of my fellow 
alumni will agree that finding programs 
that will reach us is a constant experi- 
ment and crapshooi. Programs thai work' 
on residential campuses just don't fly 
here. So to suddenly say now ihat the 
current board has "created a realistic 
mission and vision" is to say to me, 
"We're trying something different . . 
AGAIN," 

Furihcr. how effeciive is this publica- 
tion if it's only going lo "dues-paying" 
alumni? Ms, Bosk complains ihai before 
working at IPFW, she wasn't even aware 
of the alumni association or its benefits 
I'd say she's perpetuating ihe problem 
for Ihe thousands of alumni who aren't 
receiving her mailings because Ihey fail 
to pay $30-$40 a year to join, whal is, in 
essence, ihe alumni associations of ihe 
main campuses. (And most of ihc money 
goes lo West Lafayette or Bloomington.) 

Remember, it's not what you say, but 
whal you do thai makes a lasting 
impression.

Dear Communicator Editor and Staff: 



1 appreciate your editorial comments 
in the October 1 si issue of The 
Communicator. I am a student at IPFW 
and also the Director of the Kosciusko 
County Solid Waste Management 
District. I would like to offer a couple 
of suggeslions that could be of use by 
IPFW to further its recycling efforts; 

1. Coniaci Ihe Allen County Solid Wasie 
Management Disitict at (219) 449-7878, 
I'm sure they would be happy lo assist 
you. 

2. Visit www.napcor.com, NAPCOR is 
Ihe National Association for PET 

Container 
Resources. NAP- 
COR provides a 
wealth of infor- 
mation about #1 
plastic recycling. 
They also 
have available 
"PETE'S Big 
Din." This bin is 
made specifically 



also requested. 

Addresses and phone 
numbers will never be 
published. 

Submissions must be 
type- written, double- 
spaced and no more 
than 300 words. 

Submissions for the 
nexi week's issue must 
be received prior to 3 
p.m. on the Friday

consideration. 

The editorial board

as a recycling container for #1 plastic 
bcttles such as the 20 oz. bottles that 
are sold around campus. Go to 
www.napcor.com, select "On Ihe Ball," 
and ihen select "Products and 
Promotional Materials for Recycling 
Professionals." Then select, of course, 
"PETE'S Big Bin," and ii will tell you 
about the coniainer. show a picture and 
give ordering information. I believe 
they cost about $20.00 each. 1 had sev- 
eral here at the Kosciusko County Solid 
Waste District and had given ihem to 
Ihe Park Departmcni and one to ihe 
IPFW office in Warsaw. 

3. You will need lo find some sort of 
professional assistance however, 
because if IPFW collects the plastic bot- 
tles, there will have to be a reasonable 
means of collection and pick up, 

Hopefully I have been of some help. 

Sincerely,

Oh. yeah, 1 dropped my malh class. 
1 hiivc a problem wilh math, always 
have. 

1 never figured ii oul in high 
schiK)i. I remember taking algebra 
iwiec. I've always wondered aboul 
some of Ihe applications anyway. 
Dui lei me icll you aboul this class. 
Our professor, she seems lo ihink 
(hal tesl scores are refleciive of a 
'itudcni's knowledge. 

She .said she was going lo give 
partial credit for those problems ihai 
were wrong, bui worked oul correct- 
ly. She didn't. In fact, oui of 31 peo- 
ple, 16 received eiUicr a "D' or an 
"F, I'm positive she doesn't care. I 
hate having to say that loo. ll sounds 
like I'm complaining. 

She blamed the grades on "our 
inaiientiveness in class" and she 
also commenied ihai "no one had 



visited her during her office hours," 
which amounled to four and a half 
hours per week. Well, I won't let 
diis woman ruir my GPA, I dropped 
"Jie course. 

Bad grades also reflect how 
something is being taught. 1 don't 
want to get all over professors or 
anything, but I do have a few things 
10 say. 

Learning and teaching go hand 
in hand. If half of your students do 
badly on a test, it could be a combi- 
nation of five things. 



; nol prepared 



1) The students v 
for Ihe exam. 

2) The professors did not prepare 
the students for the exam. i.e. bad 
review, no review at all. 

3) The icsl was deceptive, meaning 
things on ihe exam were more diffi- 
cult or different than the book or 
lecture. 

4) Half of the students in the cla.ss 
are stupid. Or,,. 

5) Ego; "Let's make Ihe litile kid- 
dies sweat college because my life 
is Shallow. I'm bitter, and 1 hate the 
fact that I'm stuck teaching at this 
campus." 

I hope it's not ihe last one. But 
people are people, and human 



nature dictates power. We all have 
egos. We all want respect from those 
who are around us. 

Control issues are mosi associ- 
ated witfi law enforcement, the legal 
profession, and teaching. I know 
most professors can laugh ihis one 
off Especially the excellent ones I 
have now! I have lo assume, based 
on Ihe opinions of the students 
around me. thai there are several of 
these types of professors on our 
campus. I can name three, but ihal 
wouldn't be fair. Plus my freedom 
of speech would be oppressed. Oh 
well. 

Here is what we need to do to 
remedy this issue. 

It would be nice to have a sum- 
mary of all of the evaluations that 
we fill out every semester. 

The profs see them, then what? 
Do they take our comments serious- 
ly? Does the administration see 
them? Are ihey even worth filling 
out? I'm sure there are obvious pat- 
terns that develop every semester 
for certain professors. 

As students, we need to advise 
our fellow students aboul who is 
good and who isn't When you see 
"STAFF' for an instructor, call the 
department everyday and ask who 
will be teaching the course. Then 
ask around and find out if Ihey arc 
adequate enough for your tastes. 
Remember, this is your money and 
your future. 



Do you feel that you are just not doinc 
enouqh with your free time and neec 
something new to do? 



Why -don't you drop b 
talk' to the staff 
about it?

We all talk aboul the instructors 
anyway, maybe we should publish 
something, kind of like a reference 
book. 

We could go underground with 
ihe dam thing if we have to. It 
wouldn't be a witch hunt, it would 
just save a lot of us time and money, 
I think it would be good to know 
who is difficult, easy, sexist, mili- 
tant, grumpy, divorced, etc. 

It would be great to know who 
takes attendance and who has the 
best oudook on a subject. 

These arc important on a cam- 
pus like this one. Some of us work 
and go to school, and yeah, we don't 
spend a loi of lime on some classes 
It might be dial we just don't have 
the time. 

Plus all the "good" students 
could take classes from the tough 
profs since they like the "chal- 
lenge", and the slackers could learn 
from the soft profs. 

When enrollment for classes 
taughl by these certain "bad" pro- 
fessors is low. then we will have 
won the war. The war on respect and 
fairness. 

If you happen to be an instructor 
reading ihis, how do you think your 
teaching style varies from your 
peers'? Are you constantly getting 



negative feedback from your stu- 
dents? If you have, then you need to 
face the music and try a different 
style. 

Thai's right, change lo make us 
belter and help us learn. Isn't diat 
why you got into teaching in die 
first place? It should be the only rea- 
son. To make Ihe world a better 
place. You still have hard tests and 
demand attendance. Jusi be a belter 
person. Teaching isn't just lecturing 
and testing. Anyone can do that. 

If you ask, "Does everyone 
understand?" and nobody says any- 
thing, it doesn't mean thai we all 
understand. 

Maybe we are just too embar- 
rassed or shy lo say something. 
Don't act as if it is always OUR 
fault when we get a bad grade. 

Loser of die Week- -Television 
writers. It looks as if we are stuck 
with a lot of crap again Ihis fall. 
Maybe I just watch loo much lelevi- 
sion? How can these writers be so 
bad. 

By the way, 'Ally McBcal" is 
not that great, just another formula-

iype"-loveable-loser-sexual-over-

Whatever njakes you happy. Be

Forever Friends, Part 2: "A Beginning in an End" 



Features Editor 

As Bob, Melissa, and Shannon enlcred 
Luke's hospital room, ihe smell of sickness 
quickly filled their lungs. 

Laying in a bed amid';t an amy of flowers 
and "gel well" cards was iheir good friend Luke, 
Meliss.i's boyfriend and Bob's best friend from 
binh. 

He had a weakened look on his face Ifaat 
screamed suffering and whispered a slow death: 
Luke had changed so much in appearance thai 
Boh could hardly recognize him. even though 
he'd just seen him ihe day before. 

Ii seemed as liiough the stomach cancer 
Luke had been batlling for months had finally 
hen ten bim. 

As the three friends walked in the room, they 
were greeted by Luke's mom who looked almost 
as bad as Luke. 

She had lost some weight during the ordeal 
her son had been going through and had (ear 
tracks ramiing down her face that looked as 
though ihey were llicre for days. 

She thanked diem all for coming and apolo- 
gized for her appciirancc alter telling them how 
much their vt,sit meant lo both her and her son. 
She had no rcason.lo diank them, tiiough, as 
Ihey all fell it was their duty to be there. 

By tlie looks of things, this would be the last 
occa-sion in which ihey would get to see their 
friend Luke. 

Upon seeing his friends standing at the foot 
of his bed, Luke tried lo sii up. 

It was to no avail, however, and he quickly 
slumped back lo where he had been previously 
been lying. 

Bob. pulling up a chair to sit at his friend's 
side, told Luke to take it easy so he could get out 
of there quicker. Luke returned a heartbroken 
look that shattered Bob internally, and Bob 
immediately burst into tears. 

Shannon ran over quickly to comfort her 
bt&gt;yfriend as Mehssa walked over lo embrace 
Luke. 

Luke's mom, with respect lo their privacy, 
stepped out of ihe room for a liltie bit ils ihe old 
friends reunited one final lime. 

As Dob and the girls passed on die best wish- 
es of Luke's other friends. Luke lay raggedly in 
his bed and listened as if ihey weren't even 
speaking to him. 

After a few minutes, Luke's eyes filled with 
tears a^. he grabbed Bob's hand, "the priest was 
jusi in, Bob," Luke said with fear in his eyes. 
"The priest was just in to read me my last rites." 
Bob's eyes filled quickly wiih tears again as his 
friend continued. "1 don't think I'm gonna make 
this one. man. I don't think I'm strong enough 
anymore, I don't think I'm strong enough for 
what comes next." 

"You're strong enough to beat anything, 
Luke. You've got to be die toughest guy 1 know. 
You were die one everyone wanted to be like. 
You were my best friend, man." Bob said with 
stre.-uning tears. "You can'i leave me here all 
alone. 1 won't make it by myself. I won't let you 
die." 

"You don't have that kind of power. Bob. 
Besides, you were always tougher than I, You'll 
midce it fine without me. Just don't ever forget 
me or the times we had. 'cause I'll be with 



you. I'll never leave you behind — always 
remember that." 

As Luke finished, he reached his arms out and 
Dob embraced him. Melissa went out in the hall 
and got Luke's mother, who had been talking to 
Bob's modier, and Ihey all entered Ihe room 
together. 

At 4:42 p.m. on November 2, Luke took one 
last look at his world and breaihed his List 
breath. Luke had finally succumbed to the chilly 
clasp of Death's hand. 

Dob, as would be expected, took die deadi of 
his lifelong besi friend rather harshly. He didn't 
leave his bedroom in the time between Luke's 
death and the funeral, and he wouldn't Like any 
phone calls. 

He attended Luke's funeral, but he left early 
as he couldn't stop crying. His grades began to 
reflect his grief, and he struggled for D's after 
being an A and B student all of his life. 

Many nights would pass when Dob couldn't 
sleep for fear of dreaming about Luke. 

Although his dreams were a great comfon lo 
bim. providing Dob widi another chance to see 
Luke, his comfort ended when he awoke in 
tears, knowing ii was all just a dream. 

Dob's disposiiion became raiher ugly as well. 
Although he was suffering on the inside, his atti- 
tude had become dark and cruel as he blamed 
die world unjusUy for ihe deaih of his friend. 

He broke up with Shannon, which devastat- 
ed her, and spent more and more time by 
himself. 

None of his friends wanted to be around him 
anymore, no matter how sorry they fell for him. 
Bob was indeed alone in a world of mi.sery. 

The winter seemed to reflect die pain in he 
was struggling with. 

The snow was thick for most of the season 
and school was canceled or postponed almost 
every oiher week. 

It was widi reverence, though, that Bob suf- 
fered Ihe chilly elements and went to Luke's 
grave weekly and religiously lo pay his respects 
and mourn for his friend. 

On these occasions Bob would catch Luke's 
fro/cn tombstone up lo date on the goings-on of 
dieir former high sch&lt;x)l, alihough with great 
apathy. 

Dob also apologized for his not being with 
Luke in his new worid and promised the day 
would come soon enough when they would be 
together again. He guaranteed himself ii would 
just be a matter of time. 

Afier suffering through a long, bitter winter, 
springtime finally arrived and brought with it a 
new feeling of hope in Bob. 

Seeing Uic grass was still green widioui 
Luke. Bob realized that no matter how different 
it was. life was going to have to go on for him 
without Luke. 

He eventually made up with Shannon and, 
though they didn't gel back together as a couple, 
they became really good friends once again. 

Things were a liide different, but things 
were still pretty good between them. 

Dob found a better friend in Luke's old girl- 
friend, though. He'd started calling her and talk- 
ing about diings in die February following 
Luke's death and found dial it really fell good 
talking to her, or at least talking to .someone 
about Luke. 

He wasn't really close to anyone anymore, 
and talking to her brought ihem closer ,ind left 



Bob feeling great about her. 

Pretty soon, Melissa had almost completely 
taken Luke's place in Bob's life, although he 
still cried when he dioughl aboui how much he 
missed Luke. 

1 le was as close to normal as he could ever 
get by the time summer came around. 

One hot July nighu Bob was sitiing in his 
backyard looking at die stars when he heard a 
c.v pull up and a door slam. 

Looking back towards the driveway, he 
found Melissa walking towards his house. With 
a yell, he notified her diat he was in the back- 
yard, and she quickly changed directions, plot- 
ting towards where Dob's voice had come from. 
After a little wandering Uirough the dark- 
ness of Bob's backyard, she eventually found 
him sprawled out 50 feci from die house. A 
sense of relief rushed over her face. 

"Whal're you doing out here?" Melissa asked 
Dob with wonder in her voice. 

"Ahh, just enjoying a nice night. It's beauti- 
ful out here," Bob replied as he sat up to talk to 
her. 

"Yeah, it is. I love clear nights like ihis," 
Melissa said as she look a seat next lo Dob. 

"Yeah, me too. I was just thinking how our 
planet must look to one of tho.se stars up there so 
far away. They're all so far away. liiirdi probably 
looks the same to them as diose stars do to us. 
What arc you up to. anyway?" 

"Oh. just driving around. 1 thought I'd stop 
by and see what you were doing." 

"Well," Dob replied widi a smile, "I hope 
you're not disappointed. " 

"Of course I am," Melissa said with a wink. 
"How much longer do you diink you'll be out 
here? 1 was going to see if you wanted to go lo 
Andrea's pany wilh me and make an appear- 
ance. She's supposed to have a lot of people 
over." 

"Yeah, I heard dial." Bob said widi litde 
excilcment in his voice. "I'm not really in the 
mood for it tonight, though. It's really loo nice 
of a night to spend in die middle of town. Nights 
like ihis were made for the country." 

"Are you sure?" Melissa asked, "i don't 
wanna leave you here by yourself if you diink 
you might want to go." 

"Naa go on ahead and have a good time. I'll 
be fine here by myself." 

"Well, okay, as long as you're pasiiive. One 
diing before I go. though." Melissa said with 
uncertainty. 
"What's that?" 

"This." Melissa quickly returned as she 
leaned over to kiss Bob. "I'll call you tonight." 
she said as she got up lo leave. 

Taken by surprise, Bob struggled to be able 
to think again. 

lie finally mustered togedier a goodbye and 
watched her drive off in her car. 

Looking back to the stars, he felt an odd 
mixture of guill and happiness as he gazed off 
inio ihc sea of space. 

Growing tired, he went inside to wait for 
Melissa lo call with great anticipation. Things 
were finally going his way once again

Soul Coughing hacks up something good 



hy Jasfn Savaije 



Plioio lidilor 

1 had been waiting for several 
weeks widi bailed brcadi. I counted 
the days until the new Soul 
Coughing album was to hit die 
stores, considering the dou/nright 
crappy selection of new music 
plaguing my ears recendy. 

1 won't mention any names, but 
dicir initials are Hole, Eagle Eye 
Checiy. and Everything. 

I was more dian interested dial a 
personal favorite of mine was about 
lo save the day, 1 picked up £■/ Oso 
(The Dear) the day it came out and 
got home as soon as I could to find 
out wh.ii the guys had been up to. 

To say that I enjoy die CD 
would be a gross undersiaiemeni. If 
it is possible lo actually wear 
grooves into a compact disc, I have 
achieved it. 

From beginning lo end the 
quirky rhydims and eclectic lyrics 
are captivating, endiusiasiic and 
just downright rock. 

The disc opens up with "I'm 
Rolling," a drum and bass heavy 
number diat has an up tempo feel, 
wilh guitar effects dial are reminis- 
cent of a car engine, coming in on 
die verses. 

IV' curreni single thai is actual- 
ly playing on ihe radio is ■Circles." 
a bit more commercial than I'm 
used lo from ihe band, but still light 
years ahead of most of die CDs in 
current rotation. 

Michael Dougby's lyrics on all 
die tracks are like a sucker punch 
that leaves you diinking about what 
just hit yuu. 

"Lifting me up like a garage 
door, I need to feel it when the drug 
starts coming on, I know you Lord I 



;u-e a jealous Lord. I know die tablet 
is your compciiiion" is the first 
verse lo "$300," right now my per- 
sonal favorite on die disc. 

The wonis to the songs arc like 
poelry, and could probably stand 
alone in a smoky coffee hou.se and 
get their laiie paid for. 

The songs have paitems ai.d 
timings diat arc not typical rock, 
which makes Soul Coughing a 
favorite with musicians who appre- 
ciate their uinovation. 

Many of die rhydims could be 
described as "jazzy." bui diere are 
also clemenis of hip-hop. rock and 
techno. 

Songs such as "Blame" and 
"Monster Man" are fast-paced and 
great for driving (at least I think 
Ihey will be. when 1 get a CD play- 
er in my car). 

Michael says "Stop hiichin' 
with die monster man. it was a bad 
plan, but I had to get to lown" and 1 
have no idea what he means, but it 
just flows. 

I would have to say dial diis one 
is my candidate for besl of 1998. 
running die race widi no real chal- 
lenge from most other contenders 

This album shows dial the band 
does noi need to go off in a totally 
differeni direction when puidng out 
somediing new (diis is their diird 
full lengdi disc), because they are 
innovative anyway, 

1 was impressed widi diLs olTer- 
ing and decided to see if they could 
measure up when playing the songs 
live. 

On Saturday, Oct. 10, 1 got into 
my car widi no CD player and 
drove up to die Riviera in Chicago 
to check diem out. 

My friend and I arrived widiout 
moment to spare, just as dicy were 



about to go on. I would like to uike 
this opportunity lo say diat this was 
without a doubi die easiest time 1 
have ever had getdng my photo 
pass and getting to die from. 

Usually diere is much delibera- 
tion, confront;! lion, and mental con- 
supation when 1 arrive, but this was 
a Cakewalk. 

Oh, did 1 say photo pass? Boy, 
is my face red. 1 did in fact shoot 
about 23 frames of die most under- 
exposed, out of focus shots 1 have 
ever taken. Yes folks, when you 
don't plan well enough, there's a 
les,son to be learned waiting around 
every comer. Jasen, do better next 
time. 

Anyway. 1 got into die show 
just in lime for dieir first number, 
ITie band calmly walked out on 
stage 10 die roar of a radier crowded 
Riviera. 

"Screenwriter's Dlues" off their 
first album Ruby Vroom w.is die 
opener and die hand went into it 
widi a genuine intensity. 

The set included a healthy por- 
tion of their new album, as well as 
sluH from the two previous albums. 
Around die middle of die set, 
die band went into "Soundtrack to 
Mary," die closest diing diey would 
have to an actual hit single, but you 
would have diought it was Van Zant 
singing "Freebird" from die howls 
of die crowd. 

The band was energetic and 
playful widi die crowd for die entire 
set. They seemed to know what 
kind of people dieir fans arc. and 
didn't insult the crowd widi typical 
"Danger Rocker On-siagc" behav- 
ior and yammering. 

Michael Doughty recognized 
die posidon he was in. being in 
front of a mass of people, playing 



an electric guitar. 

"Hey. are you going off die rails 
on a crazy train?" he jokingly 
inquired as he went inIo a song off 
of ■Trrcsisiible Dllss." Uieir second 
release. 

The other such moment came ai 
die pinnacle moment of any rock 
show. The band says "goodnight, 
you've been great, we'll see ya 
later" as diey exit die stage and dien 
diey're done. 

Or are they? At every concert I 
have ever been to, die band sudden- 
ly bursts back on-stage to perfonn 
die one or two big songs dial diey 
seem to have forgotten. It's always 
a tense moment as die crowd waits 
and wonders if diey'll come back. 

It must be die chants that bring 
them out. Soul Coughing was no 
excepdon to diis phenomenon and 
appeared once again lo entertain us 
and give us our dollar's worth. 

Again Michael Doughty seized 
die moment to call it for what it 
was. 'Spontaneity, diy name is 
encore!" he yelled before grooving 
into "Super BonDon." 

The show was a great perfor- 
mance by a band diat 1 had been 
waiung to sec live for a liitle while 
now. 

Definitely worth the drive, I'm 
noi sure anydiing would have been 
worth all the tog I encountered on 
die way back. Uiough, 

"Where in tarnation did dial 
road git lo?" I diought to myself 

Despite that, it was a good show 
from a tide n led band. 

If they come by this way again. 
it might be worth investing some- 
time to give them a try. 

Until next time. Uiis is Jasen

Cauiion — you are about lo 
enter a black bole in space. 

Beware, Uie wind is i^ucking 
you in. The sky turns and turns in 
circles as Ihc voncx Uiaws you in 
and lums you inside oui. 

Which way is up? Is the bridge 
turning upside down, or is it only 
your imaginalJon? 

All new this year ai ihe Black 
Forest is the Voncx. 

Also, boih ihc Haunted CasUe 
and the Black Forest are loaded this 
year with new scares to keep you 
entertained to the extreme. 

Do you like lo gel lost? Try nav- 
igating through the new Super 
Maze lo find your way into the 
Black Forest. 

Every turn prcsenis a new way 
to gel losi, and a new surprise. 

The term "dead end" gets a 
whole new meaning in die Super 
Ma/e, 

Beware, as Ihe Black Knight 
may have an evil motive as he 
directs you through die Super Maze. 

Torches and candles will con- 
tinue to direct you through the 
Black Forest^ although ihc widk is 
guided. 

The over-hanging trees and 
thick bushes provide lots of distrac- 
lions along ihe way. 

Hidden creatures and liitte 
gnomes continuously move dirough 
the woods to keep you completely 
ofT guard, while die Black Knight 
oversees your progress. 

Rumor has it thai part of the for- 
est is inhabited by a band of gyp- 
sies, who proicci their burial 
grounds from any guests who wan- 
der tooclo,scly. 

They have also been known lo 
possess seemingly supernatural 
powers, including the power to 
, summon old spiriLs from the graves 



scattered throughout the woods, 

GuesLs are advi.sed to be partic- 
ularly wary of skulls and shrunken 
heads along the way. 

Two streams must be negotiated 
along the forest known lo harbor 
criminals, ghouls, banshees, and 
odier monsters that seem to be able 
to swing around in the dark ai Uic 
most inopportune time. 

Of course, you can usually see 
diem coming. 

Snakes, bats, birds, and even 
monkeys drop from the uces unan- 
nounced. Even spiders and lizards 
scattered throughout the forest want 
lo attack you in swarms. 

If you survive the Black Forest, 
a trip through Ihe 19th edition of die 
Haunted Castle will prove lo be 
more challenging than ever 

There are diree 50-fooi super 
slides. The Haunted Castle is not for 
die weak of heart. 

The extended, self-guided tour 
can take as long as 40 minutes to an 
hour to complete. 

Unless of course, you are die 
first in line, run all the way, and 
know the way out. 

Thai presumes an alien does not 
gel you first, and dial your feel do 
noi get caught in die snakes or the 
spider webs. 

You can also not be sure how 
long you will rest in your own, per- 
sonal coffin, 

Somclimes. the siand-up model 
does not open as quickly as tl 
should, while the lay-down model 
may never open again. 

No guesi has ever been able lo 
gel the lid open, once it has been 
closed for their own personal burial. 

Luckily, two guests can usually 
fit in the casket of Iheir choice, so 
they do not have to experience 
death alone, 

BoUi the Haunted Casde and 
Ihe Black Fotesi ate open every 
Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. 
Saturday, and Sunday evening 



throughout October. 

Hours are from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
on Wednesday, Thursday, and 
Sunday evenings and from 7 p,m, to 
II p,m, on Fri'lay and Saturday 
nights. 

Neither atlrnciion is recom- 
mended for young children who are 
afraid of die dark unless accompa- 
nied by a parent. 

Parents are allowed to be afraid 
of the dark, as long as they do not 
admit it to their children. 

On many nights, guests are wel- 
come to start iheir inur of the

Hot on the web: Learn the ways of the 'Ghost Hunters' 



Slaff Writer 

Well, yet again 1 have managed lo compile 
more sites wiih a Halloween dieme. 

Actually, die way I found most of them was 
by typing "supernatural" or "ghosts" into the 
search engine and visiting the pages that popped 
up. 

Typing "Halloween" gave me lots of refer- 
ences 10 the movie, not to mention those "safe" 
Halloween type web sites. 

Once again I have decided to lie and claim to 
take a neutral approach on die validity of these 
sites. 

In reality, taking a neutral position would 
mean dial I would have to treat the "Phibdelphia 
Ghost Hunters Alliance" web sites as if it might 
have a basis in reality. 

An apology to those who want me to treat it 
this way, but I'm going to have to give this site 
the "treatment." But before I do, I've got a few 
good Halloween sites I'd like to share with you, 

hllp://www.hauntedamerjca.c(im 

This site is a large directory of Halloween 
events around the nation. 

You can select a state and see a listing of all 
the haunted houses the site has registered. In 
Indiana, for instance, you can select "St. 
Vmcent's Haunted Casile." 

This would come in extremely useful around 
Halloween when you get one of ihose rare urges 



to stay inside Fort Wayne and do somediing. 

li has maps, descriptions of the haunted hous- 
es and ticket prices. This i,s a great site for anyone 
looking to get a little spooked for the Halloween 
season. 

h t Ip : //www. Halloween. com 

This is one large database, containing links lo 
Halloween sites all over the web. In fact, diis is 
the site diat led me to die "Philadelphia Ghost 
Hunters Alliance," 

It has other features as well, from ghost links 
to vampire and werewolf hnks. My only warning 
lo you about diis site is die Halloween humor 
selection. 

It contains horrible jokes that my six-yeai-old 
brodier could have made up. 

Other ihan diat, this is most likely the way 
I'm going to go from now on when I'm looking 
for the Halloween links to write abnui, 

http.7/membe rs.aol.com/Rayd8eni/lndex. html 

This web site was really mtercsting, to say 
die leasi. It's about a couple of people who have 
decided to lake up ghost hunting as a career 

Does that require special education or would 
that be a training on the job type situation',' 

Anyway, the alliance welcomes you. yes, you 
who are reading my article this very instjuit, to 
join them in dieir ongoing baide ag.iinsi the 
"undead," 

I decided that since it was an AOL member's 
page (as I am), I'd check out the designer of die 
page's prorde. 



Lo and behold, under "occupation" the guy 
had written "ghost hunter" just as normal as one 
would have put "lawyer" or "computer techni- 
cian." 

So I did some exploring on his site and found 
a page with the "special equipment" needed to 
sec ghosts. 

Some of Ihe equipment was a video camera 
or a 9mm camera. Other required things include 
e a temperature scope and those supplies which 
can easily be found at your local "militia mart." 

I was surprised by the fact that no hallucino- 
gens were listed on the page. So finally I went to 
see their log book. This was some good siuff. 

If 1 had read it completely through, here's 
how 1 imagine it would have gone: 

Philadelphia Ghost Hunters Alliance Log Book 

PCHffI: I think I see a ghoai. I also see dancing 

orange polar bears that nobody else in the room 

seeiiu lo see. Why are they looking at me like I'm 

delusional? 

PGHff2: Thai happens to me all the lime. Ignore 

the polar bears and just aim for the ghosl using 

the "Ghosl Gun. " 

PGHf/3: Roger that. Pumping Super Soaker as 

we speak. 

So why not join these people in their cru- 
sade? After all. who doesn'i have a reason lo get 
revenge on die "undead"? I blame diem for the 
chipped paint on the back of my Pontiac 6000, 
Well, cither way, SLiy tuned next week when I 
find yet more Halloween sites to crack on,..l 
mean write about.

Depression: 

Seminar helps clear path out of the darkness 



Do yon experience sadness 
and hopelessness on a regular 
basis? 

Perhaps you don'i find any 
desire lo panicipaie in activilies 
thai used [o inleresl you. Can'l 
sleep ai night? 

According to ihc hour-long 
seminar "Don't Let Depression 
Defeat You," conducted by Don 
Smith, personal counselor al 
IPFW. tiiesc are a few signs of a 
depressed person. 

On Monday, Oct. 12, the 
National Association for Menial 
Health and IPFW Wellness 
Center sponsored Iheir eighth 
seminar for depression screen- 
ing at noon in Walb 224. 

Smith and Joanne LanU, 



who is in charge of the coun- 
selor education clinic at 
Lutheran Hospiial/Lulheran 
Behavioral Health Institute. 
have participated in ihc screen- 
ing for three years. 

Participants arrived to take a 
sbon screening Icsi with simple 
questions pcriaining to depres- 
sion characteristics. 

Some examples are: Have 
you been feeling low in energy? 
Do you have a poor appetite? 
Do you have trouble 
conccnlraiing? 

Testers can choose from the 
options of some, all or most of 
the time. 

After partakers completed 
the lest, they were given scores 
from a 0-4. 

A total number would be 
calculated lo decipher if the 
individuals needed a referral for 



further assistance. 

While the outcome was 
being tallied. Smith spoke on 
the signs of depression and solu- 
tions lo Ihe problems. 

He made the point that there 
is a clear difference bciween 
being "blue" and dcpres.'vcd. 

"Blue" is a temporary reac- 
tion to everyday life situations. 

Depression is a negative 
mood or thought thai persists for 
mondis ai a lime. 

Depression can run in the 
family, be related lo a chemical 
imbalance or even go back to a 
childhood experience. 

Clinical depression may be 
a symptom of a disea.se or co- 
occurs with diseases such as 
diabetes, cancer and muldple 
sclerosis. It can also abe caused 
by medication used lo treat a 
phy.sical problem. 



Depression is often over- 
looked. 

When seeking help Smilt) 
recommends a family physician, 
psychiaui.st or inlcmist. These 
doctors can delect depression 
because Ihcy are specialized in 
the subject. 

Smith also went into detail on 
the differences bciween the var- 
ious types of depression. 

"This only occurs once a 
year and I hope il helps people." 
Smith said. 

After Ihe lesl results were 
finished panicipants had the 
opptinunity lo discuss their sta- 
tus with two professionals from 
Lutheran Hospital and three 
IPFW faculty from ihe psychol- 
ogy department. 

'This was really helpful to 
,sii down widi the counselors 
and have them .speak wiih you 



personally for free," a local 
woman who wished to withhold 
her identity said. 

Fortunately most people 
who arc dcpre.s.scd can improve 
anywhere from a few days lo a 
year, wiih help from family and 
support groups or medication. 

If you know someone who 
is depressed, the best thing lodo 
is to dL-^play support and hon- 
esty with out being overbearing. 

Smith can be reached at 
436-5986. 

Lutheran Social Services 
can be reached at 426-3.M7 for 
assistance and more detailed 
infonnation.

NBA Lockout and MLB Playoffs 

Yankees vs. Padres or Yankees vs. Braves? When will the NBA end the holdout? 



MLB PLAYOFFS 

It is safe to say ihm ihc Cleveland Indians and San 
Diego Padres have, al ihe very Icasl. surprised baseball 
fans and experts wiih their strong posl-scason play. 

The Indinns, who actually led New York iwo games 
lo one. with two lo play in Cleveland, lost in six lo Ihe 
Yankees, but noi before pulling a scare into ihe Bronx. 

I think fans are beginning to realize Uiat dominating 
the regular season mciins very liltle, and playing well at 
the end of the season is mosi important, much like last 
.season's Rorida Marlins. 

The San Diego Padres rolled over ihe Houslon 
AsiTOS ihanks largely to pitcher Kevin Brown, who was 
almosi unhiliable, if ibal is a word. 

■ Brown, who had dominated the Braves in his game 
five win, was brought on as a rclicfpitcher in gaine iwo 
and gave up a three-run homer to Braves right fielder 
Michael Tucker, 

It is easy to second gues.s a manager after 
his pile her gives up a game losing jack, but with 
Brown slated to sian game six. Padres manager 
Bruce Bochy may liavc opened ihe door for a 
Braves comeback. 

It was an aggressive move by Bochy, who 
would have been called a genius bad they won. 

I disagree with the move for iwo reasons, 1) 
Leading Ihe series 3-1 he did not need to be 
aggressive 

He went for Ihc kill and ii backfired on him. 
Leave relievers lo do Uicir job. The posi-season is not 
a lime 10 start experimenting with your ace pitcher. 

2) If Drown docs sian game six, he defmiiely wil 
noi be as fresh, and may not be nearly as dominant. 

Now ihai Ihc Braves have roughed him up, he loses 
thai aura of invincibility, and ibe Braves gain 
confidence. 

The Braves gci lo rerum home, throwing Tom 
Glavinc in game six and possibly Greg Maddux in a 
game seven scenario. 

The Braves could be the first team to ever come 
back from a 3-0 deficit lo win a playoff series. 

Incidentally, only twice in professional sports has a 



team erased a 3-0 series lead. 

BoUi limes it occurred in Ihe T-HL. wiih Ihc NY 
Islanders the last lopullil off in ihe mid-1970s. 

Cub fans, don'l wail tillnexi year. Find a new team 
this year. 

The Cubs who had a great season (by Cub stan- 
dards) need to spend some money to gel some pitching 
and defense. 

They were clearly the least talented team lhi,s year in 
all of the playoffs, yel they managed lo keep Ihe giunes 
close. 

Delusional Cub fans thought Harry could win a few 
games for them when ii counted. Their bullpen obvi- 
Du.sly could not. 

As long as fans jam into Wriglcy each summer, the 
Tribune Co. will be content to make money and not con- 
ceniraie on building a consistent winner 



NBA IN JEOPARDY 




Wiih 
progress in negotiations. 
Ihe NBA looks as if ii is going to can- 
cel regular season games for ihe first lime in 
league history. 

Training camps were suppased lo open last week, 
but personally, I could not care less. The NBA regular 
sea,son is much loo long and boring as it is. The play- 



offs are Ihc only games worth watching, and Ihey last a 
monih and a half by themselves. 

The World Scries starts next week, and football will 
last through January. I'he Christmas Day Bulls game Is 
usually Ihe first NB season game I watch. 

Only the die-hard NBA fans are going to miss it, 
because college hoops are more excidng. 

Regardless, it is hard lo find sympathy for either the 
owners or ihe players. 

The comparison to the Major 
League Baseball strike has been made 
frcijuenlly, but there are many differ- 
ences between the two, and this one 
won't be nearly as devastating lo 
basketball. 

Fini, die owners locked the play- 
ers out, and diis is noi a sirike. 

That, fact alone puLs Ibe onus on 
Ihe owners to have a season. 

They could not live wiih ihe cur- 
rent collective bargaining agreement. 

Ttiey need somelliing to protect 
ihemselves from themselves. The 
"Ltrry Bird exemption" is one of the 
major issues. 

It allows teams to re-sign ihcir 
own free agents regardless of ihe 
.salary cap. 

No one is forcing the owners to 
dole out SlOO million contracts, but 
ihey know that if they don'l. then 

another team will. 

You know you're cool when diey 
name a rule after you. 

Another major diHerencc is 
the liming. 

The NBA has been locked 
oui since July 1, and this is not 
all that unexpected. 

It was a shock when baseball can- 
celed the end of a great season and did 
not play a World Series, 

That season could have been die 
one where Maris" record was broken, 
and Tony Gwynn was chasing a .400 
batting average. 

NBA commissioner David Stem 
won't lei the NBA destroy its fan base 
with a season-long strike. 



Finally, the NBA players union is not nearly as 
strong and unified as Major league Baseball's. 

In ihe NBA a small minority of players account for 
the majority of the salaries 

Consequently diere is no real middle class, and 
many of the lower paid players cannoi afford to sum 
missing checks. So don'l look for this lockoul lo \as\ as 
long as die baseball strike in l'J'J4.
