A resolution which ealls lor (lie University adnnnish atnui

nanimotisly at last week's student senate meeting. 

Resolution 90"" *

Studenls' Coven 'til me.es llns university lo lake the strong- 
est action possible against those individual-- and to ostracize 
them from this academic community." 

This resolution is m itself an ;u-l of discrimination. 

Despite the meltnir, put inuir l he I lulled Si ales is known for, 
racism and prejudice have lone, been at the center of con- 
troversy in our nation.

invesligalions of individual Ar '"" '

racism from people they have known for years. 
The Studenls' Government is correct In its 
racism on our campus. However, Resolution !H&gt;/!)l-'.t is in

problem but perpetuates it. 

In support ol Ms proposed action. Students' Government is 

running a full-page, paid ad in this week's issue of The

ATTENTION!! 



For sometime this Students' Senate has 
been aware of a growing amount of 
discrimination of all kinds on this 
campus. Since the beginning of the Gulf 
Crisis it has grown dramatically. On 
February 7th the Senate passed a 
resolution condemning this type of 
behavior. In a free and democratic 
society it is deplorable and at an 
institution of higher learning it is 
unforgivable. We urge all other 
organizations, especially the Faculty 
Senate, pass similar legislation and take 
steps to reduce this plague. To ignore it is 
to perpetuate and encourage it. This 
must not be allowed to happen.
