Helmke, Belch clash 
over solutions for city 



By Tina Holston 
Editor In Chief 

A debate between mayoral candi- 
dates Paul Helmke and Charles Belch 
at IPFW Tuesday night resulted In 
opposing plans for controlling crime. 
Increasing urban development, improv- 
ing education and lowering unemploy- 
ment in Fort Wayne. The bottom line 
lor both candidates, however, was 
money. 

In front ol a nearly full, 500-seat 
house, the candidates responded to 
questions posed by a panel ol IPFW 
students and a prolessor, then ques- 
tions from the audience. Panel mem- 
bers were Chris Mettler, vice-president 
of the International Association of Busi- 
ness Communicators; Tracy Bunting, 
president of the Black Collegian Cau- 
cus, and Regina Kostoff, associate fac- 
ulty member of communications, 

Charles Belch. Mayor Hetmke's chal- 
lenger, suggested solutions to many 
problems facing fhe city, like more 
police officers on the streets, a $6,000 
college loan program for minority high 
school graduates, Infrastructure 
improvements through bond issues, 
and a restructured budget beginning 
with "culs at the top." Helmke continu- 
ally criticized Belch for not providing 
complete plans for his suggested solu- 
tions to Fort Wayne's problems, saying 
that Belch "Just doesn't gel it" when if 
comes to funding his proposed pro- 
grams. 'The money has 1o come from 
somewhere and his numbers just don't 
add up." 

Belch responded saying the increase 
in police protection he calls for com- 
prises two percent of Ihe city's total 
budget and with budget culs the money 
would be available. Belch said he 
would start by culling back the current 
mayoral slalf of 20. "Anyone could get 
along on much less," he said. 

Belch said the crime problem in the 
city is caused by a lack of trust 
between neighbors and in Ihe police 



force. He also blames the limited 
opportunities lor young people in urban 
areas as increasing crime. 'Given Ihe 
choice, young people find they make 
more money selling drugs than flipping 
burgers," said Belch. He said he would 
funnel more funds into human services 
facilities to help bring neighbors togeth- 
er with police to help curb the problem 
and lind more opportunities for these 
young people. 

Mayor Helmke lound fault with 
Belch's suggestion saying it was not 
well planned. "This isn't Mayberry," 
Helmke said. 'We need more police, 
and I have made the tough choices that 
have provided 30 new officers, and I 
will continue that dedication lo improv- 
ing police protection." 

Belch accused Mayor Helmke of hav- 
ing no long-range plan for the city. He 
said the police department is one 
example of Helmke's shorl-lerm 
answers, and thai as the new mayor of 
Fort Wayne he would lake the politics 
out of the police department and would 
not appoint his friends to political posi- 
tions they were not qualified for, sug- 
gesting that Helmke had done so. 

Belch also criticized Helmke for nol 
solving the problem of minority unem- 
ployment "The Affirmative Action 
chairman has resigned because he 
was told certain areas were nol to be 
investigated; he was told they were 
hands off," Belch said. "Unemployment 
among blacks is 14.6 percent, up from 
14 percent four years ago," Belch said. 
He blamed that increase on Helmke's 
"apparent disinterest in the issue." 

Helmke refuted Belch's claim saying 
the chairman resigned due to a dis- 
agreement over who should look into 
the city's employment 'practices. The 
chairman wanted a stipulation in the 
budget so he would be paid to do it 
himself, said Helmke, when it was 
already slated in Ihe budget for another 
department 

Helmke called for local governmental

reforms and restructuring of the tax 
base. He said Ihere are loo many gov- 
ernmental bodies involved in running 
the city and restructuring would put the 
responsibility back with the city rather 
than with the state legislature, county 
offices, the chamber of commerce and 
others. 

Helmke advocated a modernization of 
local government, saying that the cur- 
rent system, developed in the 1850s, is 
outdated and "is inappropriate lor Ihe 
current challenges facing ihe cily." He 
said he would advocate a multi-tiered 
tax system, a single county executor 
and a single legislature. 

Belch said the school systems cannot 
be left out of any modernization plan 
because "The educational training ol 
the work force is very important- 
Belch then explained his plan for the 
loan program for high school graduates 
saying it was not meant to lock borrow- 



ers into a $6 per hour job, but provided 
them with that option to enable them lo 
repay the loan. 

The question of annexation ol sur- 
rounding areas found Helmke and 
Belch on strongly opposing sides. 
Belch said annexation will continually 
be an embittered battle as long as the 
tax laws create a double taxing of Ihe 
annexed areas and lorce city residents 
lo pay for undelivered county services. 
Belch said he would discontinue 
annexation attempts until the state leg- 
islature made some changes. 

Again Helmke condemned Belch's 
position saying that people who benefit 
from the cily's services must begin lo 
pay for them; and having local govern- 
ment remain idle while wailing lor the 
laws to change would stagnate the 
growth of the Fort Wayne community. 

In response to audience questions, 
Belch said street repairs can only be 



available with approval of bond issues, 
while Helmke favored COIT (County 
Option Income Tax) dollars for funding. 
"Once again the numbers don'l add 
up," said Helmke on Belch's proposal 
for bonds. "The money has lo be 
there. We are still paying live million in 
interest for bond issues from 15 years 
ago. Where does it end?" 

In closing remarks, Belch said more 
police officers were most needed, 'To 
dwell on two percent of the budget here 
and there is nol the issue. We must 
make a commitment to the community, 
and il sacrifices must be made then 
we'll do it." he said. 

Helmke said "The cily Is facing some 
tough challenges and if we want more 
for education, the environment, or the 
police department, we need to be able 
to pay for It. This isn't Mayberry— the 
numbers must add up and make 



New on-line cataloging system offers students quick reference 



By Tina Holston 
Editor In Chief 

If you have been to Helmke Library 
recently, you have probably noticed the 
new computerized cataloging system. 
The system, called I.O., or Information 
Online, when fully implemented will not 
only make research quicker and easier, 
but it will also make available materials 
from any university library in the stale 
ol Indiana, according lo Judy Vlolette, 
assistant director ol information ser- 
vices at Helmke library. 

The concept of computerizing library 
systems is not a new one. and Indiana 
University has been struggling to lind 
and implement an efficient system 
since the late 1980s, said Violetle. The 
problem was further complicated by the 
state's request that all Indiana colleges, 
not just I.U. campuses, use Ihe same 
system which would allow interlibrary 
access from any college in Ihe stale, 
she said. 

"The problem is thai in the stale ol 
Indiana, (university) budgets are so 
paltry that no one library can have 
everything il needs or wants, so we 
have lo rely on one another for 
resources." said Violette. 



Indiana University's goals for using 
ihe new system are to furnish electron- 
ic access to card catalog information, 
to provide more powerful search capa- 
bilities, lo enable remote access from 
home and office computers, to improve 
the libraries' internal procedures 
through automation, to link all campus- 
es in a resource sharing network, lo 
develop an effective and timely delivery 
system lor documents, and to create 
gateways and links to other libraries 
and other information databases, 
according lo a memo senl to all I.U. 
faculty lo update them on Ihe system's 
implementation. 

In January of 1990. the I.U. library 
system began implementation and use 
of Ihe Nolis system, which 1hey named 
I.O. The system is 'being implemented 
in Ihe I.U. libraries in a cooperative 
partnership between the libraries and 
the various computing organizations 
syslem-wide," according to a memo 
Irom I.U., Bloomingion, to all I.U. facul- 
ty- 

The Nolis package has been suc- 
cessfully adopted by large academic 
libraries Ihroughoui the country, and as 
ol December 1989, over 125 institu- 



tions including Harvard, the University 
ol Michigan. Notre Dame, Indiana State 
University, and Purdue University have 
selected Nolls as Ihelr library system, 
according to the memo. 

Here in Indiana the system is nol yet 
fully operational, but it's not too far off 
schedule, said Violetle. "There is so 
much information to be programmed, 
and the I.U. campuses are very large, 
so it's a huge undertaking lo complete 
the project," she said. 

The system can be used lo search lor 
books and other materials, but periodi- 
cals have nol been fully cataloged yet 
They are cataloged by name of publi- 
cation and summary holding, lhat 
means il will tell you volumes six 
through 12, for example, are In the 
library, but it will not list individual arti- 
cles," said Violette. "We hope fo gel to 
that point eventually, we hope within 
two years, but since you can't check 
out periodicals anyway they are not as 
important to get online." 

The I.O. system also helps ease 
some of the frustration that ollen 
comes with research. With the old card 
catalog syslem there was no way to 
know if the book was actually on the 



shelf or not until you write down all Ihe 
information and call numbers then go 
upstairs to discover the book is 
checked out, With the I.O. system, the 
status ot the book is given next to each 
enlry, so if ihe book is checked out the 
screen reads; "Charged" followed by 
the date Ihe book is due back lo Ihe 
library. 

Materials can be checked out for six 
weeks at a lime; however, according lo 
Violette, a person can request a recall 
on Ihe book after il has been out for 
two weeks. 

Additions lo the system's capabilities 
include what is called Paclink, a way of 
linking all other university databases 
from one lerminal. The Paclink syslem 
Is new, said Violette, and Indiana Uni- 
versity will be its Testing ground. 'After 
ihe syslem is implemented and tested 
here, il will be made available around 
ihe country," she said. 

The I.O. syslem also makes the 
library staff's jobs easier, said Violette. 
Circulation is now online which means 
books are electronically checked out, 
and overdue notices are generated 
automatically, eliminating some paper 
work. 



Currently, there are six terminals 
specifically designated for I.O. use at 
Helmke Library, live adjacent lo Ihe old 
card catalog and one near Ihe docu- 
ment request desk designed for use by 
the handicapped. However. I.O. can 
be retrieved by any of the VAX comput- 
er terminals around campus and by 
many personal office computers on 
campus, said Violette. 

"We are planning lo add nine more 
terminals before Ihe end of this year,* 
she said. 'Then additional terminals 
will be workstations, meaning users 
can download Ihe information onto a 
disc. They will have fhe information on 
Iheir own disc which makes bibliogra- 
phies much easier.' she said. 

Even though some I.U. library materi- 
als are not yet on the syslem, said Vio- 
lette, it is very helpful. She also said 
lhat the amount of information to be 
included on Ihe syslem is nol ihe only 
problem thai slows down the imple- 
mentation process. "Money is also a 
problem," she said, "This takes a lot of 
money, we're talking millions of dollars, 
and II takes lime to get that kind of 
money together."

Video circus 

Television mishandled 
Thomas hearings 



The television ollered Americans a 
different sort of show last weekend. 
Bent to fit between 'Meet the Press," 
"Slar Trek" and the league champi- 
onships series, the Clarence Thomas 
hearings ruled the tube. It was lough 
to go anywhere without seeing his lace 
on the screen, or to sit down lor dinner 
without being expected to give your 
opinion. The hearings wore every- 
where. 

Al firsl, the smell from the TV 
obscured the substance. Most of the 
Initial nightly news focus was on wom- 
en's groups and "outraged" legislators 
howling for time to confront the 
charges. While Senate leadership 
dickered behind ihe scenes over what 
time frame should be allotted for pro- 
fessor Anila Hill's allegations, CNN and 
C-Span carried Senate and House 
reactions live. One by one lawmakers 
paraded to the rostrum to condemn 
either the Inlamous "leaker" of Ihe FBI 
report or the Judicial Committee for not 
giving it proper attention. The Tuesday 
vote deadline hung in the air until being 
changed just hours before. 

The next two days saw the lights' 
glare shine on Hill almost exclusively. 
Tom, Peter and Dan served up Sena- 
tor John Danlorth as the mouthpiece 
for both Thomas and the Bush admin- 
istration, while Hill look the Judiciary 
Committee to task at a press confer- 
ence. CNN even went live Wednesday 
to Oklahoma for a simple photo oppor- 
tunity, and to hear Hill say. "I will com- 
ply with the wishes ol the committee," 
(our limes. Though looking worn and 
Irustrated, Hill served her case well by 
protesting her lot on television while 
the White House stayed mute. She 
had established herself as a figure of 
some courage before she even 
entered Washington. 

An extraordinary display of emolion 
and politics were promised for the Fri- 
day testimonies. Six networks rose to 
meel it, all carrying the hearing live, all 
day. CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC all 
kept Hill in profile on the screen, in a 
tight close-up--the better to catch a 
teardrop, or the quiver of a lip during 
an emotional passage. Nothing like 
that was forthcoming, though. Her 
voice steady ihroughoul the sordid 
details she oflered, her eyes straight 
and posture fixed, Hill delivered the 
firm tone her testimony required. 

Anyone watching the TV Friday was 
impressed with her. 

Thomas countered with some lorce of 
his own when he returned that after- 
noon. The networks accorded him a 
wider angle, to catch angry jerks or 
hand gestures. He lashed Ihe commit- 
tee for making his disgrace a national 
spectacle, white the cameramen cor- 
roborated him. Two shots, running 
nearly back-lo-back, showed Senator 
Ted Kennedy roliing his head around 
trying to work lension out ol his neck, 
then Senator Strom Thurmond nodding 
his head distractedly. 

On Saturday and Sunday, though, 
the Big Three dropped the ball. 



Thomas' continued testimony began at 
nine on Saturday, but was cul off by 
ABC. CBS and NBC when it came time 
for afternoon sports and high-dollar 
bsers-n-babes advertisements. On 
Sunday, CBS and NBC bypassed Ihe 
hearings entirely for the NFL and 
prime-time shows. At gavel time on 
Sunday morning, Channel 21 was air- 
ing a syndicated show called "Amazing 
Discoveries." Only PBS and C-span 
continued full coverage until Ihe end. 

This particular phrase could be heard 
many times coming Irom the mouths of 
news anchors during Ihe hearings: 
The Thomas case has cast unprece- 
dented national attention on the sub- 
ject of sexual harassment." That might 
have been heard olten, but not much 
was heard about it. The Sunday morn- 
ing news shows, nightly news, CNN's 
"Crossfire," and "Larry King Live" all 
displayed the usual coterie of senators 
offering perjury charges or motivation 
questions. Careful examinations of 
sexual harassmenl-anti-harassment 
activists, psychologists, victims' sto- 
ries-were scarce. The question ol a 
regular harasser's behavior pattern, 
though possibly central to the Thomas 
case, was never addressed on TV. 

Another angle lhat was ignored by 
the television media was the racial 
one. The Thomas hearings were 
closely watched by the black communi- 
ty. Though generally unenthusiastic 
about Ihe nominee initially, suspicion of 
the motivations behind eleventh-hour 
controversy has swung black sympa- 
thies behind Thomas. Much noise was 
made on the news about the lack of a 
female senator on the Judiciary Com- 
mittee, but Ihe media passed by the 
fact that Black Americans were con- 
cerned about seeing Thomas sitting 
before an all-while panel. 

The networks did display obvious joy 
al being able to hack up lestimony for 
juicy soundbites. The bite that started 
olf Saturday's NBC Nightly News 
broadcast was Irom Thomas: "If they're 
going to kill me, they're going to kill 
me," without context or a lead-in. NBC 
also segued into a commercial break 
with this bite from Hill on Friday: 
"Judge Thomas described to me once 
a pornographic movie with the title of 
'Long Dong Silver." Who's going to 
ignore the following Dorilo's ad after 
having their attention grabbed with that 
tidbit? CNN segued in and out of the 
broadcast with a graphic reading of 
"The Clarence Thomas Hearings" over 
a video loop ol Thomas saying *l was a 
fool ... a fool to let il happen." That's 
too pointed a line to be jerked out of 
context the way CNN did. 

The networks did well to bring such 
an emotional matter before the public, 
but they cut the scene short. The tele- 
vision news media had a chance lasl 
weekend to bolster its weekend profile, 
but they opled for ad dollars and sen- 
sationalism over continued political 
insight and public discussion. It's a 
sad slory and it impoverishes us.

IPFW Student 



Tolhe Editor: 

I'm a student at IPFW. I suggest that 
IPFW incorporates three projects into 
its plan for expansion of the IPFW 
campus: 

1) A 50-meter swimming pool at the 
athletic center so thai IPFW students 
can train lor, participate in and conduct 
at IPFW imer-collegiale and Masters 
swimming meets. 

2) A new (pedestrian) bridge across 
the St. Joe River so that IPFW land on 
Ihe oiher side of Ihe river can be used 
for overflow parking required by 
expanded IPFW enrollment. Such a 
bridge will eventually be needed to 



conned new buildings on the west side 
of the river with the existing campus. 

3) Pedestrian overpasses across Col- 
iseum Boulevard and Crescent Avenue 
to facilitate pedestrian access to the 
IPFW campus without hindering traffic 
flow on those roads. 

These additions to 1he IPFW physical 
plant will significantly improve access 
to the campus and help 1o relieve cur- 
rent parking congestion. They will also 
provide students with opportunities to 
swim on campus and to walk to and 
from campus instead of driving onto 
campus.

Fake drinks teach IPFW 
students wrong ideas 



To the Editor: 

Our own SAB was once again serv- 
ing ■mocktails" in Kettler today. Near 
beer and colorful fake cocktails were 
offered to passing students. Drink a 
Mai Tai wilhoul ihe alcohol — then 
you can order a real one with confi- 
dence. This is an exercise in elimi- 
nating untamiliarity — teaching them 
to drink! Dumb idea! 

Last semester, SAB brought in a 



casino dealer for How to Gamble 
101. Their "Gambelling" party was 
right here on campus. 

What's next? "Nope-Dope?" Try an 
altered slate of mind or mindless- 

SAB is funded by student service 
fees — your Money and my money. 
Is this the programming lhat you 
would buy?

To Ihe Editor: 

In a letter to Ihe editor which 
appeared in the lirst issue of The 
Communicator this year, a student 
wrote requesting lhat a vehicle lor 
free expression be placed on our 
campus such as is often seen on oth-

As chair of the student affairs com- 
mittee of the IPSGA Senate, I would 
be most eager and Interested in dis- 
cussing this matter further with this

found their way to our oflice. These let-

students with very little lime and ovon 
less intelligence. 

The only smart move made by these 
leMer wrltors was to submit them 
unsigned, or In Dear Abby style (i.e. 
Rejected Ralph from Rhode Island). 
But unfortunately, The Communicator 
doesn't publish letters In Ihe Letters lo 
the Editor section il they are sent In

Darn, and I really wanted lo print that

Gossip and back-biting are a way of

Professor looks at recent 
changes in Lithuania 



By Julius Smulkstys 
Guesl Columnist 

I spent this summer in my nataive 
Lithuania where these days so much 
history is being made. The year start- 
ed here on a tragic and pessimistic 
note but only seven months later Ihe 
long-sought goal of independence 
was finally achieved. And even more 
surprisingly, this small Baltic country 
helped lo ensure the deleal of Ihe 
anti-democratic forces In Ihe Soviet 
Union proper. 

The two unintended results ol Mr. 
Gorbachev's pereslroika and glas- 
nost policies were Iho disintegralion 
of the Soviet communist parly and 
the Soviet Union ilself. Both process- 
es began In Lithuania. In December 
of 1989 Ihe republic's Supreme So- 
viel removed Article 6 from the con- 
stitution, thereby ending Ihe party's 
monopoly of power. As il this was not 
enough, during the same month the 
Congress of the Lithuanian Commu- 
nist Pany declared its independence 
from ihe parent organization In 
Moscow. The two events were impor- 
tant enough to produce Mr. Gor- 
bachev's hastily-arranged trip to 
Lithuania, the first ever by a reigning 
Soviet party leader. However, his 
efforts to bring the rebels back In line 
failed, and soon thereafter the Soviet 
Union's legislature followed Lilbua- 
rjla'sjead by removing Article 6 from 
the naiional constitution. 

In February a truly free election lo 
Ihe Lithuanian Supreme Soviet 
resulted in an overwhelming victory 
for Sajudis (or. Movement for the 
Restructuring of Lithuania) whose 
only campaign plank was a call for 
the immediate restoration of indepen- 
dence. The parliament approved Ihe 
restoration on March 11 without a 
single opposing vote and only 6 
abstentions. Once more, Lithuania 
was lirst to speak the unspeakable 
and lo do the unthinkable. Pre- 
dictably, other republics did not wait 
very long belore asserting their own 
right lo self-determination. 

During Ihe summer of 1990 
Moscow tried an economic blockade 
lo force Lilhuania lo rescind ils inde- 
pendence declaration but that did not 
work either. By the end of the year 
Ihe hardliners in the Kremlin must 
haves concluded that stronger mea- 
sures were needed against this 
recalcitrant republic. In January the 
first coup against a democratically- 
elected government was tried. Il did 
nol succeed but fourteen civilians 
delendlng Ihe Vilnius television tower 
were kilted by the Soviet army. The 
killings took place at night and at a 
time when the world's atlention was 
locused on the imminent allied attack 
against Iraq, suggesting that in the 
era ol glasnost even the men of the 
old order where reluctant lo use force 
openly in the absence ol any provo- 



cations. The (ailed coup in Lithuania 
also said a lot about the conspirators' 
lack ol will lo carry out their objec- 
tives to a successful conclusion. 
When Ihe dawn broke, they quickly 
disappeared in Ihe nearby barracks. 

Late in July the hardliners changed 
their ladies once more. Slill unwilling 
lo use force openly and decisively, 
they apparently decided lo create an 
incident which would provoke Lithua- 
nian retaliation and, in lurn, justify 
imposition of repressive measures. 
The sneak attack on a Lithuanian 
customs post at Medininkai and the 
massacre of seven officials was such 
an incident. There were no signs lhat 
the victims pul up any resistance; 
they were lorced lo lie down and 
were shot in the back. Interestingly, 
Ihe attack took place during Presi- 
dent Bush's visit lo Ihe Soviet Union, 
suggesting lhat it probably also 
reflected the conspirators' descision 
to give up on Mr. Gorbachev as an 
inslrument of Iheir plans. In this sce- 
nario, the crushing of the Lithuanians 
while his good Iriend and benefactor 
was still visiting would have an 
added benefit of dramatizing Ihe 
Soviet president's powerlessness 
and irrelevance. But as always the 
unpredicable Lithuanians did not 
react as they were supposed lo. 
There was no retaliation. By Ihis 
time, the forces thai were determined 
lo lurn. Ihe clock back were beginning 
lo run out ol time. The playing of the 
Lithuanian card was not achieving 
the desired results and ft must have 
occurred to the members of the 
soon-to-be-established emergency 
committee that Gorbachev. Yeltsin 
and whoever else stood in Iheir way 
in the empire's heartland had to be 
directly confronted belore the Union 
treaty was signed and the new order, 
legitimized. 

In Moscow the coup makers exhib- 
ited the same lack of will and opera- 
tional effectiveness as did their surro- 
gates In Vilnius seven months earlier. 
Moreover, civilians in Ihe Soviet capi- 
tal and other cities had already 
learned Irom the Lithuanians how to 
mix symbolism, psychology and 
peacelul resistance in defense of 
strategic buildings. The Russians. 
Ukrainians, White Russians and oth- 
ers now also knew thai if the mighty 
Soviet Union could not bring little 
Lithuania to its knees, there was 
hope that they, too. stood good 
chance of prevailing. This knowledge 
strengthened the resolve of the peo- 
ple and helped to keep their spirits 
high during the darkest hours ot the 
coup. In the end, off course, the 
nations of what used to be Ihe Soviet 
Union had to win their own revolu- 
tions. Still, by leading the way in the 
liberation struggle, Lithuania made a 
contribution to the cause of freedom 
well beyond ils boundries. 



bish* about Mark S. Snyder. 

The resuHs of our research show thai 
the esteemed Mr. Partisan was a little 
misdirected in his complaints. It seems 
that Ihis paper has mentioned Snyder 
only one time in a staff-written article 
this year. The words "Mark S. Snyder" 
appeared in the Sept. 19 article head- 
lined "Student Senate Dispute Settled." 
His name was printed only once in the 
article. The story said lhat according to 
student body president Krlslina 
Frazler, Snyder was interested in 
the then-vacant vice president ol 
legislation spot. 

But student letter writers and Snyder 
himself have generated much copy, 
filled with Ihe name ol our controversial 
siudenl leader. In Ihe six issues printed 
prior to this one, Snyder's name has 



appeared in some lorm 28 times. This 
Is broken down further to one lime in a 
news article, five times in headlines, 
five times in letters submitted by Sny- 
der, and 17 limes in tellers written by 
students about Snyder, 

In the six issues prior to this one, 
Snyder has written live letters lo the 
editor and various IPFW students have 
done another live about him. 

It is quite obvious lhat this newspaper 
is free from responsibility concerning 
the flack taken by Snyder on these 
pages. Il was the letters by Snyder 
himself, furthered by student responses 
to Snyder lhat brought him back into 
the white-hot spotlight. Remember lhat 
The Communicator only mentioned him 
one time In a news article this year. 

I don't think the well-respected Mr. 



Parklsan woukj want us to throw away 
all letters by or about Snyder to keep 
him out of trouble. I know that Mark 
definitely would not want this, nor doos 
he need our protection. He's a big boy. 

I'd like to point out here that The 
Communicator welcomes letters, espe- 
cially non-dumb ones. We just love to 
hear what you've got lo say - except for 
scathing comments about my eye- 
brows.

IPFW recycling, conservation needs addressed 



To the Editor: 

When I first arrived at IPFW two 
years ago. I was a bit ashamed ol the 
lack of recycling on campus and use of 
Styroloam containers in the cafeteria. 
Both of these environmental discrepan- 
cies have been amended. There are 
containers for the recycling of alu- 
minum in nearly all of the buildings on 
campus, and there are containers lor 
recycling of mixed paper in Kettler and 
several other buildings. Through the 
efforts ol concerned individuals, Styro- 
loam usage in the cafeteria has been 
nearly eliminated. Now available are 
rewashable plastic glasses and cups

Unfortunately. IPFWs efforts at waste 
reduction are being stymied. According 
to Paul Slrouls, director of purchasing 
lor IPFW, our school has lost nearly 
half ol the initial inventory ol plastic 
glasses. II this continues it will cost the 
University nearly $1,500 this year due 
to cup and glass removal Irom the 
cafeteria. In addition, I see many alu- 
minum cans in the trash cans, along 
with paper lhat could be recycled.

This callous thievery ol reusable con-

Students gain work experience while attending school 



By Heather Washington 
Staff Writer 

While the masses admired the col- 
orlui array of presentations at the 
Three Rivers Festival parade this 
summer, junior Nancy Downs 
expressed satisfaction. 

"We did that," said Downs, who 
worked as a liaison between partici- 
pants and evenl co-ordinators earli- 
er Ihis year. IPFW's cooperative 
educalion program offered her the 
opportunity to interview (or Ihe posi- 
tion. 

The nationally recognized training 
program backed by the federal gov- 
ernment ... provides challenging and 
rewarding work experiences," says 
Diana Hergatt, director ol career 
services and cooperative education. 

IPFW initiated Ihe program in 
1986, placing its first student in a 
study-related field in 1987. Since 
then, cooperative education has 
become a national network. As a 
result. President Bush sent man- 
dates this year to the nation's col- 
leges, declaring October national 
Cooperalive Educalion Month. 

Full-time studenls who have ful- 
filled their major's freshman require- 
ments and maintain a specified GPA 
are currently earning $5.50 to 
$11.50 per hour as cooperative edu- 
cation participants. 



Previously a career service adviser 
for Ohio State University. Hergatt 
has worked diligently since her 
placement at IPFW a little over a 
year ago. 

"Businesses want to give some- 
thing back to the community. When 
you mention that work, "community,* 
it's like lights shining in their eyes." 
Hergatt used this approach last year 
to increase employer participation in 
the program 56 percent. 

Now she wants to increase student 
participation to fill the positions 
being offered. To do that, Hergatt is 
spreading information in almost 
every form of media available. The 
cooperative education department 
frequently places bookmarks and 
yellow flyers around the campus. 
Mailings to employers and students 
report the latest research data, and 
the Learning Resource Center is 
creating a video concentrating on 
present cooperative education par- 
ticipants. 

Senior AN Farhoumand learned of 
the program through an announce- 
ment made in his accounting class. 
He now works part-time as a cost 
accountant for IPFWs largest coop- 
erative education employer. General 
Motors. Of the 127 assignments the 
cooperative education department 
offered last year, General Motors

provided 22 of those opportunities, 

Farhoumand said during the first 
three to four months, the employee 
is concentrating on how to do the 
job. After that, he said , the student 
begins asking why the job is being 
done, "it's overwhelming. You don't 
think about the cost that goes into 
everything," he says. 

Another employee lor General 
Motors' air craft division frequents 
Hergatt's office regularly to pick up 
the department's business cards. 

"I talk to those interested in co-op, 
even if they are not from this 
school," stated senior Vinh Trinh. 

An electrical engineering technolo- 
gy major. Frinh points out to others 
what the sees as the program's ben- 
efits. 

"it gives you a chance to apply 
your technological skills that you 
learned at school." Trinh believes 
the experience is a "good strong 
point on your resume" because "you 
already have your toot in the door." 



"Businesses have what I call a 'lor- 
mula for success.' That formula is 
education plus experience. They 
want you to have experience before 
you start,* says Hergatt. 

Michelle Hadley. senior studying 
industrial engineering technology, 
plans to use her experience from 
working at Bluffton Agricultural 
Industrial Corporation as a stepping 
stone in her career climb. 

"I do any plant layout work they 
require," said Hadley. She said Ihe 
employer will teach you what you 
need to know. "Oon't be intimidated 
or scared," she suggested, 'Many 
times I was back to the drawing 
board." 

Although she attended Purdue Uni- 
versity for three years, she waited to 
join the cooperative education pro- 
gram until she attended IPFW, 
"Down there (Purdue), it's so much 
more competitive." She also sited 
the proximity of job offers as a rea- 
son for waiting. "Ididntwant to take 



off to California.* a circumstance 
which cooperative education stu- 
dents at large campuses sometimes 
experience. 

"I knew how valuable this experi- 
ence would be," junior Cari Gast 
said. "I was in here (the cooperative 
education office) asking questions, 
saying 'What can I do to prepare for 
this?" Majoring in personnel man-

OIL JUNKIES? 



Face it. 

We are a nation of fossil-fuel junkies. And we are pushing this energy 
narcotic on our children. 

Unless we break our oil habit, we doom the next generation to a 
lifetime of fossil-fuel dependency The symptoms are easy to spot. 
An insatiable craving for gasoline. Disregard for the environment. 
An obsession with maintaining unstable oi! supplies at any cost. 

But we can break this addiction without painful withdrawal. By 
driving less. Demanding more fuel- efficient cars. Investing in energy 
technologies that fuel our economy but keep the environment clean. 

It's the only way to keep today's children from becoming tomorrow's 
oil junkies.

Teen education program 

Heads Up, Feet First delivers warnings about neurological injuries 



By koIIi E. Berry 
Copy Editor 

Using your head and keeping 
your (eel on the ground is a good 
piece of advice lor anyone; espe- 
cially lor someone who is going to 
Jump into an unknown body ol 
water. So this bit of advice became 
the name lor an organization in 
Fort Wayne designed to let fifth 
through twelfth graders undersland 
thai Iheir common sense can pre- 
vent injuries. 

Vlcki Maisonneuve, admissions 
and community liaison tor the 
Parkview Neurological Center, 
R.N., CRRN, along with Ihree olher 
people, brings this program into Ihe 
schools. Heads Up, Feet First is 
co-sponsored by Ihe Fort Wayne 



Neurological Center and the 
Parkview Regional Neurological 
Center. Maisonneuve described 
the program, "We lalk to ihe kids 
about prevention and about the 
importance of thinking, using Iheir 
common sense to protect them- 
selves." 
She coniinued, "The Fort Wayne 
Neurological Center, which 
Includes neurologists and neuro- 
surgeons, fell that there was a 
need in our community for a pre- 
vention program. They pul these 
people back together after the type 
of accidenls we're talking about — 
spinal cord and head injuries — 
and they felt if was important that 
Ihey pul something back into the 
community in order to help prevent 



these injuries." 

Heads Up. Feet First is brought to 
the sludents in schools in Fort 
Wayne and surrounding areas. The 
general set-up of Ihe program is lor 
Maisonneuve to speak first about 
the anatomy and physiology of a 
spinal cord in a brain injury. The 
sludents then see a movie featur- 
ing teenagers and young adults 
who have survived these types of 
accidenls to Ihe spinal cord or a 
brain. Maisonneuve said that 
because the survivors are young 
like the students, Ihey relate very 
well to Ihe audience. 

Following the movie, Rick Ram- 
sey, a taxidermist from Kendallville, 
who is a spinal-cord injury survivor, 
and Bob Schultz, who is a survivor 



ol a traumalic brain injury, speak 
about their experiences. After their 
presentations are over, the floor is 
then opened for questions 
Maisonneuve said Ihe sludents 
locus more on the survivors 
"because it is such a rarity to have 
people who have actually experi- 
enced this lype of thing come in 
and talk to you. I think that is whal 
makes the program such a suc- 
cess." 

Wha! does Maisonneuve have lo 
base the program's success on? 
"We were pleased lo receive a let- 
ter recenliy from Dr. Stevens; he is 
a member of the Fort Wayne Neu- 
rological Center," said Maison- 
neuve. The letter staled that he 
and the other physicians in the

Living a full, successful life, with paralysis 



By Kelll E. Beery 
Copy Editor 

Whal is if like lo have your life 
change dramalically in one short 
second? How about when your life 
changes so extensively thai you 
have to relearn many things lhat 
you used to lake for granted? 

Rick Ramsey, a taxidermist from 
Kendallville, had to face these 
questions in 1987 when he was 
paralyzed from his waist down in 
an alcohol-relaled accident. Afier 
drinking, he fell asleep al the wheel 
and his car rolled three times while 
Ramsey was thrown from the car 
and pinned under the rear axle of 
the car. 
Since the accident, Ramsey has 
had 10 surgeries and has had lo 
learn how to get around in a 
wheelchair, new bowel and bladder 
programs, how to release the build- 
up ol pressure Irom continual sit- 
ling, how lo get over curbs and 
around obstacles, how to drive a 
car with push-pull hand controls, 
and how to get his chair in and out 
of his car 

Ramsey is one of the presenters 
of the Heads Up, Feel First pro- 
gram given lo fifth through twelfth 
graders in Fort Wayne and sur- 
rounding areas. The program 
stresses using common sense as a 
preventative measure for spinal- 
cord injuries, and he has volun- 
leered his lime lo the program for 
about one year now and also vol- 
unleers al a hospital. He talks to 
new patienls of spinal-cord injuries 
and lets them know that life is not 
over. "They can still gel around 
and do things they used to," said 
Ramsey. "I still do everything I 
used to do: I slill hunl, I still fish. 
Also alter my accident I had lo 
learn something again. I had to go 
back to school." 
So Ramsey wenl back to school. 
He attended a taxidermy college in 
Wisconsin. "I was told before I

went there I couldn't do II, simply 
because I was in a wheelchair. So 
I went lo school, i graduated in ihe 
lop ol my class, I took three awards 
while I was there, I'm in the state 
organization, and I've laken two 
second places in slate meets. This 
guy who told me I couldn'l do il is 
my number one enemy because he 
feels like I'm alter all his business." 

During Ihe Heads Up, Feel First 
program, Ramsey presenls his 
experience. After he is done 
speaking, Ihe sludents are able lo 
ask him questions. When asked 
whal the mosl common queslion 
was that was asked of him, he 
replied, "A lot ol kids want lo know 
why I do Ihe program. I simply tell 
ihem I'd ralher meet them in a 
classroom than in a hospital." 

Another popular queslion Ihe stu- 
denis ask Ramsey is about his 
family, "My father had a stroke two 
weeks alter my accident," Ramsey 
answered. "II takes a loll on every- 
body, not only including yourself. 
it's your family. I have a son and it 
affected him quite a bit. Even 
some of the things coming up 
today with him I believe reflect 
back on whal has happened to me. 



II reflects everybody around you. 
You lose your friends. Everybody I 
deall with al the lime ol my acci- 
denl, 1 never see them. They don't 
call me, and il I call them they don't 
return my calls. Now everybody I 
run around with is in wheelchairs 
just like myself." 

Ramsey makes sure lhat his chair 
does not slow him down. He start- 
ed up a basketball learn in Fort 
Wayne in addition to all his volun- 
teer work. He hopes lo do some 
fundraisers ihis tall wilfi the basket- 
ball learn. 

Ramsey has not always been so 
well-informed on spinal-cord 
injuries. When he was on his high 
school football team, he and olher 
teammales played only to give 
punishment to Ihe olher team. 

"We hurt a quarterback early in 
the season when we hit him with a 
sweep irom bolh sides and pulled 
all the muscles in his back and pul 
him out Ihe rest of Ihe season until 
the very last game of the season. 
We played them that game and we 
turned around and did the same 
thing to him again. We could have 
literally broke thai kid's back. We 
never thoughl about it. We were 
just out there bealing the other 



teams up. That's all we wanted to 
do. 

"They don't realize what can hap- 
pen. They hit a guy on the lield, 
he's laying there and Ihey bring a 
board oul and lay him on it and 
haul him off. Then later it's going 
to make Ihem think abouf it. After 
Ihey realize what they've done, I 
would think they would feel pretty 
guilty about it." 

Ramsey's last bit of advice to stu- 
dents is that they need to think 
more about whal they are doing. 
He knows students will make mis- 
lakes, but he hopes that Ihis pro- 
gram will help students realize Ihe 
possible negative outcomes of Iheir 
actions.

neurological group had seen a 
decreased number of diving acci- 
dents in the community. Theyleltit 
was a direct result of Ihe Heads 
Up. Feet Firsl program, said 
Maisonneuve. 

Apart from the letter. Maison- 
neuve said, "We feel it's been very 
elfedive if doing nolhing more lhan 
reaching a number ol young adults 
in the Fort Wayne and surrounding 
areas." 

When asked, if she felt Ihe pro- 
gram's content was new to Ihe stu- 
dents, Maisonneuve replied, "I 
Ihink the concepl of being injured Is 
not new to most young adults," she 
said. "I think Ihe outcome of an 
injury of Ihis magnilude is. When 
you hear on the news someone 
suffered a head injury, no one 
understands Ihe long-term ramifi- 
cations of a brain or head injury." 
Bob, who works wilh ihe Heads 
Up, Feel First programs, is five 
years posl injury and is still working 
to regain Ihe things lhat he lost. 
said Maisonneuve. 

She continued, "I think it's not so 
much lhal they (the audience) don't 
know, bul that they've never 
thought through and Ihat's what we 
stress, Ihinking through polenlially 
harmlul outcomes." 

Maisonneuve staled that ihe acci- 
denls Heads Up, Feet First 
addresses are preventable 
Choosing a designated driver will 
prevenl drunk driving accidents 
and wearing a seal belt will reduce 
Ihe chance of injury if in an acci- 
dent, she said. Maisonneuve also 
stated, "II you don't dive inio (he 
shallow end of a swimming pool or 
dive into unknown waters head 
first, you're going to have a much 
safer experience than if you do."

important about this program is lhat 
Ihe presenters donl lecture. "We 
give Ihe information, and we stress 
the important part ol the informa- 
tion without leduring," said Maison- 
neuve. 

"We know kids are going to go oul 
and drink and drive. We know kids 
are going to dive into Ihe shallow 
end of a pool. We know kids arenl 
always going to wear their seat 
bell. We know they don'l always 
wear helmels when riding a motor- 
cycle. ...We tell them Ihese are ihe 
things thai can happen-use your 
common sense," said Maison- 
neuve. 

The Heads Up, Feet First pro- 
gram can only reach a limited num- 
ber of sludents, but parents can 
play apart in bringing the program 
to their children's schools by talking 
lo PTA presidents, principals, and 
health and physical education 
instructors These people can Ihen 
contact Ihe program organizers. 

Whether or nol children see the 
presentation, parents can still talk 
with their children about using com- 
mon sense lo prevenl accidenls. 
"Most parenis can do lhat easily," 
said Malsonnueve. "You sit down 
with your kids, sit down wilh your 
grandkids, and say, 'Use your com- 
mon sense when you're out in the 
world. We know you're going to 
make mistakes. Call us. If you 
have a drink, don't drive." 

"I think there is a way parenis can

ing the kids angry."

Dire Straits names a new street 



By Jim Walker 
Managing Editor 

Dire Straits 
On Every Street 
Warner Brothers 
The wait wasn't all that bad. Dire 
Straits look six years to return with a 
new album to follow their mega hit 
"Brothers In Arms," but I didn't mind. 
It wasn't that I didn't look forward to 
more trom Mark Knopfler and his 
band, "Brothers" was just an album 
solid enough to stand up through the 

gap- 
Now Dire Straits has come back 
with a record worth waiting lor and 
worth putting on the shelf next to 
"Brothers." 

"On Every Street" features the 
same mixture of slow, bluesy tunes 
and stomping rockers. To match 
"Money For Nothing" from 1985, 
Knopfler has brought us "Heavy 
Fuel," a last song with equally quick 
lyrics. With tongue in cheek Knopfler 
sings "My chick loves a man who's 
slrong/The things she'll do lo turn me 
on/ I love the babes, don't get me 
wrong/ Hey, that's why I wrote this 
song." . . . gjj 

With his lyrics'Knopfler appeals 
both to listeners who lake time literal- 
ly, and those who catch the sarcasm 



ol his words. 

The first single released from the 
album, "Calling Elvis," is a catchy 
song but lacks depth in comparison 
to Ihe rest of Ihe album. It is sort of 
Ihe "Walk of Life" of this record. 

On Every Street's best sounds 
come from the title track and from 
"Fade to Black," a down beat blues 
track. On "Fade to Black" Knopfler 
keeps his lyrics simple and blue. "I 
bet you made a pass/ I see a dark- 
ened room somewhere/ You run your 
finger round the rim of his glass/ You 
run your fingers through his hair/ 
They scratch across his back/ Fade 
to Black." 

Knopfler even lakes a stab at the 
apathetic world in "My Parlies." After 
singing "don'l talk to me aboul the 



polar bear/ Don't talk to me about the 
ozone layer," he continues "Let's 
hear it for Ihe dolphin - Let's hear il 
for ihe trees/ Ain't running' out of 
nolhln' in my deep Ireeze." 

There's much more than Ihe words 
to Dire Straits. Knopller's guitar work 
is as distinctive as anyone in rock 
today. He may not be fast, but that's 
not always where it's at. He just 
sounds great. Along with the stan- 
dard guitar crunch, Dire Straits mixes 
in strings on "Ticket to Heaven" and 
horns on several tunes. 

"On Every Street" features a perfect 
mixture of accessible rock songs and 
bluesy mellow tunes, making it an 
album worlh listening to for another 
six years.
