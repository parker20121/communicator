Editor in Chief 
After 19 years at IPFW, Stephen 
Roby. campus chief of police and direc- 
tor of safety, has turned in his resigna- 
tion lo be effective Dae. 6, 




Stephen Roby 

Roby gave notice of his resignation 
on Gel. 3, He said he decided this past 
summer to linish his 19th year of ser- 
vice at IPFW and relocate. He said 
there were several factors influencing 
his decision, but the strongest was his 



desire lo move to the Southeastern 
United Stales. 

Roby insisted his resignation was In 
no way connected lo recent controver- 
sy surrounding the campus police 
department. 

After hearing atxiul Ihe hiring of Jerry 
Koeneman, an ex-oflicer ol the New 
Haven police department, a group ol 
students, including some IPSGA mem- 
bers, began investigating Koeneman"s 
past because they had reason to 
believe it was questionable, said Nancy 
Barger, a student senator. 

Koeneman was fired Itom the New 
Haven police department in December 
ol 1965 for "knowingly violating rules, 
engaging in immoral conduct and con- 
duct injurious to the public peace and 
welfare." according to a New Haven 
News article published on Dec. 21, 
1985. 

The New Haven News also reported 
that Koeneman's niece tiled a com- 
plaint with Ihe Allen County Sheriff's 
Department in November of 1985 
regarding child molestation and incest 
involving Koeneman. 

When questioned about a possible 
connection between his resignation 
and the hiring and firing of Koeneman, 
Roby's response was simply "No." He 
refused further comment. 

Barger said Roby found out aboul 
their inquiries because ol a 'leak to Ihe 
chancellor.* 



'We also wanted to gal rid of Roby.' 
Barger said, "because anyone who 
would hire him {Koeneman}, knowing 
his background, isn'l showing good 
ludgment." 

"Roby had been aware of this over a 
year," said Koeneman concerning his 
record with the New Haven police 
department. 

Sally Green, also a student senator, 
said Koeneman called her at home lo 
Iry to win her over. "He called me 1o try 
to get me to be an advocate for him." 
she said. 

'He was pleading his case and tried 
convincing me of his innocence," slat- 
ed Green. 

Koeneman never actually served on 
the campus security force. He was fired 
before he was scheduled to begin on 
Monday, Sept. 23, said Koeneman. 

"(The vice) chancellor of financial 
affairs told Roby not lo hire me 
because they didnl have the funds lo 
III! the position." said Koeneman. 

Richard Ritchie, vice chancellor of 
financial allairs, said Koeneman was 
never hired. Ritchie said he made a 
decision lo put a freeze on hiring secu- 
rity officers. 'It was at Ihe same lime 
as the Koeneman incident, but it was 
coincidental." 

The police department was "in the 
midst of a self study," Ritchie said. 

"The study is to study staffing pat- 
terns .. and to determine how many 



ollicers we need.* 

II will "analyze luncllons within the 
depanment and come up wilh recom- 
mendations lor improved slaffing," 
Ritchie said. 

Koeneman said he went lo see 
James Ferguson, director of personnel 
and payroll services, on the Monday he 

"Koeneman said he 
believed the controversy 
was directly related to 
Roby's resignation. " 

was to begin work to find out why he 
was told nol to report in for duty after 



problem with a decision that Steve has 
made.' 

Koeneman also said that Ferguson 
told him ihat he had a problem with Ihe 
hiring of Koeneman but "wasnl at liber- 
ty lo discuss it." 

Ferguson told The Communicator thai 
"Koeneman was never on the payroll." 

When questioned if Koeneman v/as 
hired or fired, Ferguson again replied, 
"Koeneman was never on Ihe payroll.' 

Ferguson said he did not remember 
commenting on Roby's decision mak- 
ing, but said he did remember the 
meeting with Koeneman and his wife 



Tina on Sept. 23 

Koeneman said he believed the con- 
troversy was directly related lo Roby's 
resignation. 

"Roby told me he was tired ol the 
political rhetoric,* said Koeneman, 

Denying a connection between his 
resignation and Koeneman's hiring and 
fifing. Roby said after his resignation is 
in effect, he plans to 'travel extensively 
for a while, read and investigate the 
relocation potential of several South- 
eastern costal cities." 

Roby said he leels his contribution to 
IPFW has been positive. 

*l feel like I've done a lot." he said. 
"It's been a good experience and I 
appreciate the support I've received 
from the (acuity, staff and some stu- 
dents." 

Roby came to IPF^ lirst as a student, 
majoring in criminal justice. He gradu- 
ated with a B.A. in public allairs. 

He joined the campus police as an 
officer in 1972 and in 1986 look on the 
responsibilities ot IPFW's chiel of 
police and director of safety. He 
accepted the job for the challenges 
associated with "the management per- 
spective," he said. 

Paul Sirouts, director ot purchasing 
and general services, will serve as 
interim police chief and director oi safe- 

'y- 

Ritchie said a search tor a new police 
chief will begin soon. 



Two students killed in unrelated incidents 



Student killed in auto

Editor In Chief 

An IPFW student was killed and two 
olher men injured in an automobile 
accident at Coliseum Boulevard and 
Crescent Avenue last Saturday morn- 
ing. 

Charles G. Kapocius. a 23-year-old 
senior, died at the scene, said Jim 
Zamora, Fort Wayne Police Depart-

Mother arrested in 
shooting death of son 

By Tina Holslon 
Editor In Chief 

An IPFW senior was shot and killed 
last Friday night; his mother has been 
arrested for Ihe murder. 

Slatton C, Hedlof, a 19-year-old 
freshman, was found dead on the 
couch of his mother's home on the 
city's southside last Saturday morning, 
said Jim Zamora, Fort Wayne Police 
Department public information olficer. 

Responding to a call of a possible 
suicide, police went lo 4102 S. Lay- 
fayelte St. where Sandra Hedlof said 
she found her son lying m blood on her 
couch and called 911, said Zamora. 

Hedlof's death brings the Allen Coun- 
ty homicide total to 25 for 1991. 

Sandra Hedlof was arrested Saturday 
after she, her daughter and her daugh- 
ter's boyfriend were questioned, said 
Zamora. 



The accident may have been alcohol Sandra Hedlof is being held wilhoul 



bond. 

Stalton Hedlof was shot once m the 
chest; the ,32 caliber bullet peneltaled 
his heart, said Allen County coroner 
Phillip O'Shaughnessy. 

Police first thought the death was a 
suicide, said O'Shaughnessy, 

"It appeared lo be a contact wound." 
Alter the autopsy, 'it looked less like a 
suicide and more like a homicide." said 
O'Shaughnessy. 

'Suicides are almost always a contact 
wound, but there is almost never a 
contact wound in a homicide." 

Station Hedlof was shot through a 
blanket and his T-shirt, said O'Shaugh- 
nessy, and the evidence collected from 
them suggests he was not shot at from 
as close a range as was first thought. 

O'Shaughnessy said Station Hedlol, 
who lived on flidgewood Drive, spent 
the night at his mother's South 
Lafayette Street home Friday night, 

Sandra Hedlof told O'Shaughnessy 
thai when her son did nol respond 
when she tried to awaken him Satur- 
day morning, she called the police. 

Police have no motive for the slaying, 
but the investigation will continue, said 
Zamora.

Engineering and technology programs receive accreditation 



By Chad Heslling 
Features Editor 

IPFW's mechanical and electrical 
engineering programs were awarded 
accreditation for the first time for Ihe 
Fall 1991 semester. The Accredita- 
tion Board for Engineering and tech- 
nology judged that the Bachelor of 
Science degrees in both disciplines 
met its standards for uniform engi- 
neering requirements. 

A bachelor's degree (or eleclrlcal 
engineering was insltluled in 1985, 
and the mechanical engineering 
degree (oltowed in 19B7. IPFW's 



request for accreditation review, 
made in Ihe summer of 1990, was 
this school's (irsl. Dr. Muhammad 
Rashid, chairman of IPFW's engi- 
neering department, staled the need 
for ABET's stamp of approval 
"Accreditation gives a uniform stan- 
dard for everyone, so that everyone 
knows whiat a graduate has been 
taught. Government and industry 
want a level of consistency among 
graduate students." 

ABET's accreditation is also an out- 
ward sign ol legitimacy for local stu- 
dents. "Accreditalion should make 



our programs much more attractive to 
students considering engineering," 
said Mynard Mansfield, School of 
Engineering and Technology dean. 
Rashid concurs "Wilh this, students 
don't have to lose credits if Ihey 
transfer to West Lafayette, or have 
other slodents feel they're missing 
something i( they transfer here,' he 
said. 

Accreditalion of a program is a 
lengthy process, lasiing as long as 
len months, ABET sends its officials 
lo IPFW for exhaustive research of 
the bachelor's programs. All aspects 



touching the engineering deparlment 
are reviewed: faculty size, (acully 
qualifications, faculty workload, cur- 
ricular objective, emphasis on engi- 
neering sciences and design, com- 
puter use, and support services. 
Even the prerequisites are examined 
tor academic soundness. Current 
students are quizzed over required 
material and graduated students 
were mailed questionnaires on the 
quality of their education. Faculty 
training and experience are also sub- 
mitted lo ABET. 
In an unaccredited program, bache- 



lor's recipients are required to obtain 
Iwo years' professional experience 
before Ihey may lake their Profes- 
sional Engineers exams. Wilh ABET 
accreditation a student in an industry- 
aided cooperation program are auto- 
matically awarded one year of work 
experience toward the exam. 

With the ongoing construction of the 
new Engineering and Technology 
building, accreditation has made for a 
successful year for the engineering 
depanment. "Before, it was just a 
dream," Rashid said, "but by '89 we 
decided lo go for il." 



Safety v/eek film addresses acquaintance rape 



By Tammy Rasnick 
News Editor 

tn an attempt lo raise campus awareness ol date and acquain- 
tance rape, "Against Her Will' was shown lasl Monday. The 45- 
minute film was followed by a panel discussion The panel consist- 
ed ol Karen Bojrab, Victims Assistance, Fori Wayne Police Depart- 
ment; Jeanne Harbor-Porler, Rape Awareness, Fori Wayne Wom- 
en's Bureau: and Conna Miller, professor ol criminal juslice. 

The lilm, narrated by Kelly McGillis, examined the increasing prob- 
lem of date rape on college campuses. According lo the film, Ms. 
Magazine and the National Inslilute of Health conducted a survey 
which found Ihat one out of every four women were victims of rape 
or attempted rape last year. Rape is more common among women 
than leli-handedness, according to the movie. 

The film not only presented the statistics of date rape bul also 
guidelines on how lo avoid date rape. The suggestions included: 



Avoid men who show no resped lor women, avoid risky situations 
that could potentially lead lo rape, always have a friend know where 
you are, and slay sober. 

The film suggested that students should be more aware of what 
rape is all aboul and Ihat schools should require students lo leam 
alxjut it, just like math, science or English. 

Bojrab felt that the most Important poini is Ihe issue ol alcohol, 
"Women must understand that II they are under Ihe influence, Ihey 
cant make real decisions." Bojrab also pointed out that rape is a 
women's issue, men doni consider Ihat women have to deal wilh it 
on a daily basis. Bojrab is pari of program that goes Into ihe area 
high schools and educates the students aboul&gt;rape. All o( Ihe 
members agreed Ihat education is imporlanl. Porler (ell Ihat it 
should be a grass roots movement ol education that moves (rom 
the students all the way up to the administration. 



Date and acquaintance rape is a problem that no one seems to 
consider happening lo them on a personal level, according to the 
Ms. and NIH survey. The sun/ey also stated that 73 percent of the 
women who were raped did nol believe that it would happen to 
them while 41 percent o( the victims who were raped expect lo be 
raped again. 

But rape isn'l just an invasran of someone's rights, according to 
Bojrab, it's a crime about violence and power. "Rape is no more 
related to sex than getting beat over ihe head wilh a bat Is related 
lo baseball,' said Bojrab. 

According to Gloria Allred, an aHorney in California, the American 
criminal justice system is not ready to deal wilh acquaintance rape. 
The public has lo be educated in order to prepare the systems to 
deal with il, and until thai happens, man who rape will continue lo 
go unpunished.

Terminally ill patients 
have the right to die 

People (ear death. Most donl want lo die. They want to continue doing what 
ihey do, striving (or what goals theyVe yet to meet. 

Bui some people have only death to look lorwatd to ■ only death and pain. 
These individuals often welcome a quick death instead of the torturous months or 
years ihey may have lo spend hooked up to the machines of medicine. If the ter- 
minally ill wish to die, they shouldn't be slopped. 

Last Wednesday, retired pathologist Jack Kevorkian helped two seriously ill 
women kill themselves on a campground near Pontiac, Mich. Kevorkian is the 
same doctor who gamed national atlenlion last year when he helped an 
Alzheimer's patient commit suicide. 

Is the suicide doctor a killer? Some think so. American physicians have attacked 
Kevorkian on the gjounds that he is working against Ihe medical profession's goal 
10 heal people. 

But doctors are also around to help those v;ho need physical help, Kevorkian 
helped Sherry Miller and Marjofie Waltz by aiding them to their death. Both were 
in extreme pain and neaiing death. Kevorkian knew the two could not be healed. 
But he could help ihem lose the pain in the only manner possible in this situation. 
The right to die debate currently buzzing in our nation goes further than ihe 
Kevorkian case. 

In Atlanta last week, physicians requested permission from a local court to dis- 
continue life support for a 13-year-old girl, comatose since May and dying a 
painfully slow death. 

The doctors say the girl can (eel nothing but pain. There is no chance for a 
recovery from her degenerate brain disorder, (he doctors say. 

But Ihe child's lalher refuses to permh the hospital lo let her die. He said he is 
waiting for God to heal her. So far, the court has ruled in favor of the father. 

The slate of Washington is attempting to make situations like the one above 
easier to contend with legally. On Nov. 5. Washington voters will mark a ballot on 
an initiative lo allow a terminally ill person lo obtain help Irom a physician to die. 
The initiative requires the patient to sign a living will requesting "aid in dying' and 
the patient must be mentally competent. 

If ihis inilialive is passed, it will be the firs! lime active euthanasia by physicians 
is technically legal in America. So lar. polls in Washington indicate that voters are 
behind the referendum. 
5 II a law or at leasl a court ruling was made concerning this case, the issue 
r-would be better defined. As it stands, ihe questions are broad and it is impossible 
I'to predict what could happen K criminal charges were tiled against someone like 
Kevorkian. To help someone commit suicide is to take a big chance. 

If a ruling does come down on active euthanasia, it should be based on the fol- 
lowing: Terminally ill patients should no! have to sutler only because medical 
technology has made living possible for them. Doctors should not be forced by 
law to eirtend unnecessary pain. 

Another curve on Ihe issue comes Irom Derek Humphry and his surprise best- 
seller book 'Final Exit." Humphry's book reads like a how-to guide on suicide. In 
Ihe book, ha lists lethal daig doses lor Ihose considering suicide. 

But Humphry's book has led to suicide people who are not suffering from physi- 
cal illness but. Instead, mental illness. 

Humphry himself was hit dose to home with Ihis problem when his former wife, 
Ann Wicken, killed herself after sulfering ttom long bouts of depression. 
Quite obviously, suicide is not Ihe recommended ireatmeni for depression or 
mental illness in general. Humphry and his book have just made it easier and 
more socially acceptable (or depressed and confused individuals to lake an easy 
out of life's problems. 

These people should have instead sought the psychiatric treatment that could 
have turned around their lives. 

It comes down to the question ol when should people be allowed to die. In the 
case of painlul, inevitable death for the terminally ill, the answer is simple. The 
patient should have Ihe right to choose death as an alternative to toriure. 

But in the case ol the mentally ill or despairing individuals, the call is a tougher 
une. First the person must be offered all ol the psychiatric help possible. 
After that, only the individual can choose whether to live or die. 




Lehers To The Editor 



Group leader addresses writer's questions 



To The Editor: 

Mike Wade's letter to the The Com- 
municator of Oct. 17 had prompted me 
to clarify the scope ol the IPFW Wom- 
en Writers" Support Group, of which I 
am currently Ihe facililalor. 

The group vjas organized through the 
Center lor Women and Returning 
adults, and funded by our student gov- 
ernment. The intent of Ihe group is not 
lo exclude men, but lo encourage and 
support women writers who may have 
special issues not germane to other 
writers. A group must deline itsell 
somehow and have a goal andtpur- 
pose unique to itsell, or it provides no 
special service lo the members. The 
American Association ol University 
Women is a woman's group designed 
not to exclude men, but lo speak 
directly lo university womens' issues. 
Disabled veterans' groups include both 



male and female, but they must be dis- 
abled vets. That is not lo say other 
vets are not equal, it is to say that dis- 
abled vets have special needs that are 
different Irom other people's needs. 

It is not that men do not deserve a 
writer's group. II is that students must 
organize groups to meet their own 
needs. Someone has to make Ihe 
eHorl. According to Ihe Director of Stu- 
dent Activities' oHice, there are no offi- 
cially recognized writers' groups on 
campus. No male has requested that 
he participate directly in the IPFW 
WWSG. S6\reral men have asked if 
they could lend their support in other 
ways, and the group has, o( course, 
accepted. If a man needs a support 
group, I would not deny him assis- 
tance. 11 the IPFW WWSG is not 
appropriate lo a person's needs, I will 
gladly assist any person, particular 



interests and requirements. I think a er good is welcome lo conlact me 

men writers' support group is a won- Ihrough The Center for Woman and

To The Edllor: 

In response lo Mike Wade's letter to 
the editor ol Gel. 17. concerning Ihe 
campus,VVomen .Writer's group, it 
should be made clear, the University 
does not sponsor this group. It is 
sponsored by the Center for Women 
and Returning Adults at the request of 
a female graduate student in Ihe 
English department, who desired a 



lorum lor women to share their literary 
works, aspirations, etc. The Center for

The Communicator stall has been 
taking some heat lately Irom students 
who contend that we've missed some 
important news stories that took place 
on campus. Hard lo believel 

So, I assigned my Oblruse Angle stall 
the task of looking into this situation. 
We discovered several other important 
scoops missed by Ihis paper. Here 
they are:

13. Prince's latest love Interest?

JOURNALISM FUN - A couple of 
weeks ago, I bummed a couple press 
passes from a real-journalist friend of 
mine and made Ihe trip down lo Bloom- 
ington lor a thrilling I.U. football con- 



It was after the game that the real lun 
begani Alter Ihe Hoosiers linished pun- 
ishing Northwestern something like 
172-3, I lollowed the sharply dressed 
press corp down to Ihe Memorial Stadi- 
um basement lor Coach Bill Mallory's 
press conference. 

As he thoughtfully answered 
reporters questions, I pretended lo be 
jotting down notes for the slory that I 
would never write. Just for Ihe heck ol 
It, I wrote down all o( the nifty sports 
cliche's Mallory said- 
Here are a lew of my favorites: 

1 . Getting it under out belt 

2. Turning it on 

3. Getting on lop 

4. Putting iilogeiher 

5. Cranking it up 

6. Coming through in the clutch 
Somehow there is something Freudi- 
an about sports cliches. Wouldnl you 
say? 

Anyway, I enjoyed myself al Ihe press 
conleience - maybe a little loo much. I 
ended up being tossed out of Ihere by 
a security guard alter I asked Mallory. 
'Excuse me, are those Bugle Boy 
, jeans you're wearing?" 

Aller the conference ended, I fol- 
lowed the other reporters to the locker 



room I didn't spend a loi ol time in 
therel Needless to say the sensory 
overload of huge, sweaty, naked, foot- 
ball men walking around larting and 
stuff was too much. I nearly swoonedl 

On my way out of the locker room 
area. I noticed a woman journalist per- 
son hanging around the exit. She 
seemed to be sort ol bored and she 
had very alluring amber eyes, so I 
stopped to chat. 

"So," I said, 'you have lo wait out 
here huh?" I waited for her affirmativa 
nod. "Bummerl" I added smartly. 

She agreed with my assessment and 
went on to inlorm me Ihal most college 
locker rooms are restricted for women. 

I again added "Bummer!" Then I told 
her I'd be glad to interview some play- 
ers tor her. 

She declined my olfer and then, 
thinking I was some kind of creep hit- 
ling on her, told ma to gel going on my 
way. 

Needless to say, I got Ihe hint. 

Anyway, I certainly enjoyed my Irip to 
Bloomington and all of the thrills and 
chills I experienced pretending to be a 
real journalist. And there was a free 
press lunch. How was it? Scrump-Dilly-

Killers to convene here on Oct. 31 



By Sally Snydgr 
Fealures Edllor 

Week-long prison furloughs were 
announced in slale and federal 
penitentiaries across ihe United States 
in Older to send convicted murdereis lo 
Fort Wayne this Thursday. Oct. 31 is 
the opening day of Ihe first annual 
convention of the International Mass 
Murderers and Serial Killers 
Association (INflf/SKA.) to be held here 
in the Summit City. 

The Ihree-day symposium will meet 
at two sights: the Grand Wayne 
Center and IPFW's Walb Memorial 
Ballroom. A lull slate of lectures, 
discussions, and leleconlerences has 
been arranged lor the atlenders. 
Groups will meet to air their views on 
such topics as "Lizzie Borden . . . 
Masterstroke or Myth?," 'Adult 
Children ol Serial Killers." and "The 
Jugular vs. the Aorta: Where lo Strike 
First." Actor Anthony Hopkins will be 
the keynote speaker. 

Despite some cries ol protest from 
city neighborhood associations, city 
officials are downplaying any possible 
public safely risks. An official Irom 
Mayor Paul ^^elmke's office, who spoke 
lo The Communicator under Ihe 
condition of anonymity, claims Ihe 
IMMSKA conference will do lar more 
good than harm. "The murderers will 
bring a half-million dollars into the local 
economy. There's a positive 



psychological factor, too. After the 
Burlington Northern and Ihe Tolkheim 
layoffs, citizens need a Utile sideshow, 
a little excitement to take their mind off 
such things." The official went on to 
say that he was aware of the 

public outcry, "But who cares? 
Corpses don't vote for Belch on 
Eleciion Day." 

However, not everyone involved has 
so optimistic an outlook. A 
spokesperson lor the IPFW police 
staled. 'It's been crazy here at the 
office. We're desperate to hire 
lemporary help. ... We'll have eight 
officers assigned to watch over 2,000 
convicted murderers, just like 
metropolitan Detroit.* On Monday the 
IPFW Human Resources Office 
confirmed a report ol a record number 
of vacation requests this week. 

II^I^SKA President Charles Manson 
was enthused about the three-day 
event. "This will be a first, ... 
Stranglers, cannibals and sex killers 
from alt walks ol life will be able to 
speak their minds and help reline their 
craft in a place other than a 10x12 
cell," Manson said. He claimed that 
excitement was rurining high among 
rank-and-file members, slating that 
'rumors have been flying all week 
about the Zodiac Killer finally surfacing 
at Ihe convention. Also, we're all 
looking forward to Saturday's charity 
brunch, where we'll be toasting the late 



George Hennard. All proceeds will go 
to the National Rifle Association, 
which has given us so much help over 
the years." 

Serial Killer and AC/DC (an Richard 
Martinez talked to The Communicator 
in a phone interview, "You gotta hand it 
lo Manson, he's put together a great 
convention, and picked a great 
location. Downtown around the Grand 
Wayne Center is a little dull, but the 
IPFW campus is dark and quiet by 
night ... perfect for extracurricular 
activities,* said Martinez with a 
demented giggle. 

Manson concurred with Martinez. 
"He's right, of course." Manson said. 
"These guys are fresh from prison and 
want to show their friends that ten 
years in the stir hasn't made them 
rusty," He warns IPFW students, "Get 
ready. We'll be waiting lor you down by 
the river, behind Ihe bushes by the 
sidewalks, drop down on you Irom the 
trees, and that free lot, ho ho ... it's 
paradise. 

Manson licked his lips. "I'm gonna 
bring the whole family. It's gonna be a 
great Halloween." 



CM Third floor revolt 



Cadavers wandering the campus 



By U.R. Stupid 
News Edllor 

Recent reports from students and 
faculty involving mishaps with 
reportedly naked, decomposing 
persons all over campus have lead to a 
campus upnsing. 

Biology professor Di Section blames 
it all on the problems they have had on 
the third lloor of Classroom Medical 
Building. 'It started last week in our 
human anatomy class. A couple of the 
students began taunting one of Ihe 
cadavers, as it it were slill alive. They 
poked at it and laughed continually 
until the cadaver sat up and smacked 
them both in the face. We all sat there 
stunned, a few students fainted and the 
cadaver just stood up and walked out," 



Imma Scammer, a psychic on 
campus, claims that the cadavers have 
found new life because of their 
annoyance, "I can sense Iheir 
displeasure In being examined by 
strangers. They don't enjoy the 
annoying culs and dissections of their 
bodies. They got tired of if and they're 
not going to take it anymore." 

Walking corpses have been seen all 
over campus, picking on students and 
faculty. According lo campus police 
reports, Ihe cadavers tend to poke 
people in Itie eyes, yank on 
appendages and attempt dissections of 
various anatomy. 

Students and faculty are now arming 
themselves with scalpels and 
formaldehyde. Several outbursts 



between the living and the dead have 
occurred. Recent figures show that Ihe 
stiffs are causing more Injuries than 
expected. Campus police urge that 
students and faculty avoid any 
confrontations with anyone nude and 
appearing lo be dead, to prevent any 
further iniuries.

Public Enemy stand on top of the music world 

By Chad Hasllnq relenlivs lo let Public Enemy sullv lis demented accents to the music, incredible 



By Chad Nesting 
Features Editor 
Public Enemy 
Apocalypse '91 ... Jho Enemy 
Strikes Black 
Del Jam Records 

What's thai rumble? It's the new 
Public Enemy record, tilled (deep 
breath), Apocalypse '91 - The Enemy 
Strikes Black, Even if you only hear il 
Irom a passing Alpine stereo, (he 
sound is distinclive. Most other rap 
acts sound like thrum ... thrum ... thrum 
... t(om out a ca: window. Public 
Enemy's beats are lasler, calling to 
mind someone trapped inside an oil 
barrel and pounding to get out. 

Since Apocalypse got to the store, 
I've heard it roll by my house seven 
djtlerent limes. One ot those times was 
last Monday morning al 5 a.m., blaring 
'Move" loud enough lo wake me up. ... 
II you are reading this, whoever you 
are, I'm paying my paperboy lo slutl a 
Journal-Gaielte in your tail pipe il you 
try it again. 

Anyway, bach to the business at 
hand. Public Enemy's music comes at 
you hot and fast, then shifts the tempo 
or the arrangemenl to accent the 
chorus. The kick drum beats are 
always big, but it's iho hyperactive 
snare and hi - hat notes that make the 
Enemy sound dislinclive. The 
producers, who go by the name Bomb 
Squad, have lent that sound to Bell Biv 
Devoe. with surprising success. 
Michael Biwens turned around and 
beslowed it on Boys II Men and 
Another Bad Creation, who scored lop 
ten hits of their own. Could WMEE be 
within striking distance ior Public 
Enemy? 

Well ... doni hold your breath. WMEE 
and its pop radio ilk are far too anal- 



retentive to let Public Enemy sully i 
airwaves with real musical and lyrical 
substance. Public Enemy rappers 
Chuck D. and Flavor - Rav are far loo 
righteous to dilute their music or 
message, anyway. 

Consider these lines Irom their new 
single 'Can1 Truss It'; "Now the story 
I'm kicking is gory/ Little Rock be where 
they dockin' this boat/ No hope I'm 
shackled, plus gang tackled/ By the 
other hand swingin' the rope/ Wearin' 
red, white and blue, Jack and his crew/ 
The guy's authorized to beal down the 
brown ' Also; 'Look, here comes the 
judge/ '/ears ago he would have been 
the ship's caplain/ Gettin' me bruised 
on a cruise' Got me layin' in my own 
leftover/ 1 roll over in somebody else's/ 
There's blood in the wood and it's 

Now this is Public Enemy's single, 
mind you, their entry into radio and 
MTV, There haven"! been many acts in 
the rock and roll era thai have chopped 
into such brave lyrical terrilory, and far 
fewer have ever landed in the top ten. 

Apocalypse turns its sights from the 
weight ol white supremacy lo the 
problems Ihal keep the black 
population Irom unity and strength. 
'Rebirth" and -Nighltrain" lei! the 
audience to watch Hs back. 'You cant 
see who's in cahoots/ 'Cause now the 
KKK wears three-piece suils,' reads a 
line from "Rebirth." 'Nighltrain' warns 
Ihat the enemy can be black. 'The 
black thing it's a ride I call the 
nighltrain/ It rides the good and ihe 
bad,' Chuck D. says and goes on to 
shake his head at the stickup kids, 
dealers and fiends, 'Some ol them 
looking just like you." James Brown, his 
voice squeezed up an octave, yelps 
'nighttrainl' in Ihe background lo add 



demented accents to the r 

'Cani Truss It' comes next, its bass 
beats slowed and punctuated with horn 
leaps. Put it on your next parly mix 
tape; asses will shake, I guarantee. 
Slinky guitar highlights "I Dont Wanna 
Be Called Yo Niga," but check the 
funky piano arpeggios thai drive Ihe 
song, courtesy of keyboardist Frank 
Able, 

'NIga' takes Ihe new, reconstituted 
NWA to task lor this summer's Niggaz 
4 Life record, NWA crowned 
themselves with the title ol "nigger" 
while shouting tales of random 
violence, dealing and prostitute killing. 
Flavof-Flav counters Ihem by calling 
them 'Toby.' He raps. Toby says yo I 
be good mga/ Let me gel a shovel and 
make a good digger." Like the death's 
head on Ihe Apocalypse cover silently 
stales, all ol the violent mayhem a man 
can muster still adds up to zero. 

•By the Time I Get lo Ariiona' 
linishes side one. and il's Public 
Enemy's most accomplished song yet. 
The bass starts slow and low, while a 
fat synlh figure weaves in and out like 
a rattlesnake. Chuck D. raps about 
flying to Arizona to parlicipate in a King 
Day celebration in the slate without a 
King Day. "Veah, he appear lo be lair/ 
That cracker over there/ He try to keep 
it yesteryear/ The good ol' days/ The 
same ol' ways/ That kept us dying.' 
Then Ihe music shills lo a huge, 
echoing bass and drum beat overlaid 
with an organ. Il's an apocalyptic 
sound, reminding me of Goodwill 
slomping through Tokyo, before the 
music snaps back to the first rhylhm. 
Now a gospel choir peppers the song 
with loud 'oohs,' kicking up Ihe tension 
level ot a song track that was pretty 
high-strung to begin with, "Arizona" is 



incredible 

"Move" on the second side, isn't a 
command lo dance, but rather 'So if ya 
draggin' us down/ Gel up, look out, get 
oul the way/ Movel" The sampled 
sounds of pouring beet and belches 
gurgle through 'One Million 
Botllebags,' a rap Ihal puis down malt 
liquor drinkers. "They don't sell that shit 
in Ihe white neighborhoodsl' cries 
Chuck D. , and he's right. Check the 
Norlhcresi Belmont Liquors' beer 
cooler verses Atkins Liquors' il you 
dom believe him, 

Slack cops and The New York Post 
gel dissed before the record closes 
with "Bring tha Noize.* 'Noize' is a 
three-year old P.E. track, this time with 
Anthrax' thrash guitar added. Rap and 
metal have met belore many times but 
never with this speed and force- 
Apocalypse is a real musical roller 
coaster ride. Now add it up with me: 
tight drums, big bass, Chuck D. and 
Flavor-Flav, Ihree classic records in a 
row, best iyrics anywhere, guitars in 
Ihe mix. 

So scratch the Stones and the Who, 
they're nostalgia acts. Forget 
Springsteen and (ho Sex Pistols. 
Prince. Clapton, the Replacemenls. 
and Run-OMC. Public Enemy is the 
world's greatest rock and roll band.

wjthoui thinking I replied, "Fort Wayne 
has seen three productions of 
'Nunsense' since 1988," We laughed. 
At the time I prided myself on my 
sharp, cynical wit. Later, when I realfy 
began lo ponder the queslion. I 
realized what i said summed things up 
pretty well. Three vatsions of 
"Nunsense" suits the Summit City just 
fine. 

Many theater goers in Fori Wayne 
might not realize the intended insult in 
my remark — they lovad "Nunsense," 
When il played al the Cmc in 1988 it 
bnake bon office records and why not? 
It's about wacky singing nuns doing a 
talent show and boy is it cute. A\vtu| 
cute. So cule it could even be 
upgraded to "dariing." K's a considerate 
play, too, lor it doesn't force the 
audience into any unpleasantries like 
thinking or feeling threatened or being 
challenged. It just floats efforllessly by 
for two hours and then pops. Curtain. 

I saw the Civic's most recent play. 
'The Road lo Mecca," last Friday, and 
try as I might I couidnl lind ona singing 
nun onstage. The play is about one 
artist's struggle lo keep creating when 
forces (botti internal and outward) have 
been gathering lo slop her. It is also 
about love. Uusi. despair, betrayal, 
redemption, God, ostracization, 
perseculion, and sell-absorption. None 
ol the three characters ~ Miss Helen, 
the artist; Elsa, her disciple; or Marius, 
the local reverend (and part-time 
heavy) — have any noticeable 
wackiness to Ihem. My queslion, then, 
upon entering the Museum of An on 
Friday was simple: How does a theater 
that specializes in shows like 
"Nunsense," "Steel Magnolias," "The 
Boys Next Door." and "Life With 
Father" handle something profound like 
"The Road to Mecca"? 

The answer in a momenl. First, a 
necessary digression: "The Road lo 
Mecca" is not the first great play lo be 
staged in Fori Wayne. Over the past 
four years or so — the "Nunsense" era 
-- plays by Shakespeare. Marlowe, 
Shaw. Wilde. Chekhov, Sloppard, 
Fugard (again) and Miller have been 
attempted by the Civic, PIT, and First 
Presbyterian theaters. With few 
exceptions, the productions fall into two 
_'._calegories: earnest failures or 
"K^mplefe disasters. Whether the blame 
'should be heaped upon directors or 
actors IS moot; the point is, Fort Wayne 
theater has trashed some ol the 
greatest piays of both the classic and 
modern theater. All three theaters are 
guilty (I'm no! including Arena Dinner 



Theater, which specialised on "Bowling 
lor Murder" shows). Last year saw 
Civic's disastrous "A Midsummer's 
Night Dream," PIT'S arrogantly 
amateurish "Or, Fauslus,' and First 
Presbyterian's ridiculously Hoosier 
'Pygmalion": three shows all done 
embarassingly. 

All three productions showed actors 
with limited range v^ho technically 
could not make the leap ffom 
naturalistic Iwentieth-century dialogue 
to the poetry ol the classics. It's nol 
thai the actors dtdnl try; they did. They 
just didm have the training technique 
or bravado to pull 1 off. 

Back on "The Road to Mecca." Civic 
gave a good rendition of a great play, 
featuring a surprisingly deft 
performance Irom Jeffery Moora as 
Marius. There were dead spots in the 
two-hour twenty-minute production, but 
overall the power of Fugard's piece 
cam© through almost unfiitered. 

First of all, ihank God Michael 
Mitchell look the road out of the P.A.C. 
While the Museum ol Art presented 
Ions of technical problems, it is a 
wonderful refuge from the dungeon at 
the Performing Arts Cenler. The seats 
were uncomfortable and it was too 
cold, but the immediacy ol the space 
translated well for Fugard's intimate 
piece The actors had lo accommodate 
to Ihe acoustics of the high-ceilinged 
Museum, and although a few 
consonants were lost, the actors 
generally woh the battle with the 
bounce. Rick Grubb's set was 
ingenuously simple: long, open, and 
featuring expansive sightlines Inilally I 
leared the lengih ol Ihe set would 
exclude audience members in the 
extreme seals of the house, but I 
discovered at intermission that those 
seats were pretty good, with virtually 
no obstruction from the set. 

Civic's production got oil lo a bad 
start, and ihe problems Carol Howell- 
Wasson and Molly McCray had in Ihe 
lifst half hour illustrate how difficult 
Fugard's plays are la do. Fugard writes 
about strong complex people and the 
layered relationships they have. In his 
plays the curtain opens to people who 
have known each other well for many 



years. This intimacy the characters 
share is honest, time-worn, and hard to 
fake onstage. In Civic's 'Mecca," Miss 
McCray and Mrs. Howell-Wasson 
eventually warm to each other, but at 
the outset the chemistry between them 
was lorced. the friendly laughier 
untrue. Later, when McCray started 
talking about "irust" and its attendant 
weight (in a wonderfully vulnerable 
speech) the actresses seemed to relax 
into the roles. And when Marius arrived 
shortly before the (irsi act ended, the 
play truly started to click. 

I saw Jeff Moore do an old man in 
Pinter's 'The Homecoming" (1987, PIT, 
a great production) and was impressed 
by his technique. At times you could 
tell the old man was really twenty-oi^e 
but generally the walk, the talk, and the 
weight were believable. Also, he 
managed to give Ihe character some 
energy, and the small bits ol physical 
comedy were done extremely well. 
Since then I've seen him onstage a tew 
other times and although he Is very 
talented, I think his precision as an 
actor can come across as calculating. 
As the uptight Marius, though, Moore's 
precision and technique paid off. The 
delicate banter with Elsa and Miss 
Helen, the specific, realized gestures 
— ciearly the 25-year-old Moore 
understood perfectly what made the 



No-Point 
MORTGAGE 



older Manus tick. 

Carol Howell-Wasson played Miss 
Helen as a normal housewife taken 
over by a bewildering arlislic force, and 
although Elsa calls Miss Helen a 
"reactionary revolutionary" I was 
surprised by how recessive Howell- 
Wasson's performance was. It's an 
mteresiing choice, and sometimes — 
especially when Miss Helen describes 
her all-night urge to create — it works 
beautifully. But what gels sacrificed is 
Miss Helen's strength, Howell-Wasson 
made her loo weak and self- 
deprecating to be the revolutionary 
(When Elsa talks about constantly 
being 'challenged" by Miss Helen, it's 
difficult to believe.) 

Molly McCray's Elsa comes 
dangerously close to being a parody of 
a bitter, one-dimensional person. She 
has some fine momenis onstage, but 
generally the performance is m one 
note, loo harsh and brittle by halt. And 
why In God's name didn't somebody 
make her cut her hair? Her curly, 
impressive mane obscured many facial 
expressions and in a role as nakedly 
open as Elsa, we need to see Ihe face. 

Both actresses made it work, though, 
aided by the beauty of Fugard's words. 
There were a few wrong turns on this 
road, but Civic's production got there. I 
hope that upcoming shows in Fort 
Wayne (including 'A Streetcar Named 
Desire' and "The Miser") take Ihe 
same path. II not, we could be in lor 
more "Nunsense."
