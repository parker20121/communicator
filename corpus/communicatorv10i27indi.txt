FACULTY NOTES 



Instructor in Mathematical Sciences 
has recently completed work toward a Master of Science 
degree in Mathematical Statistics at Ball State University. 
Her thesis topic was: "Ridge Regression: Biased Estimation 
Based on Ill-Conditioned Data". 



Dr. Bernd Erdtmann, Professor of Geology in the Depart- 
ment of Earth and Space Sciences, has recently been 
awarded the Heisenberg Scholarship by the Federal Govern- 
ment of West Germany. The Heisenberg Scholarship is 
the most prestigious academic fellowship in West Germany. 
Dr. Erdtmann plans to conduct palaeontological research 
primarily related to Cambrian-Ordovician Boundary and 
also to complete a reference book in geology, during 
the tenure of this scholarship. 



Professor Christiane Seiler of the Modern 
Foreign Languages Department and Associate Professor 
Clark Butler of the Philosophy Department have received 
a $25,000 research grant from the National Endowment 
of the Humanities to complete an English edition of Hegel's 
correspondence with annotation and commentary, during 
the 79-80 academic year. 

Dr. Robert Roubos, Chairman of the Division of Music 
and Professor of Music, presented an organ recital this 
past March at the Peachtree Christian Church in Atlanta 
Georgia. This recital was a historical presentation of music 
from all periods of organ literature. Of particular interest 
was the oldest known organ piece from the Robertsbridge 
Codex of 1325, transcribed from the original tablature 
by K. Marie Stolba, musicologist on the faculty of the 
Division of Music.
