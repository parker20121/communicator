Panel endorses reinstatement 



by Nol Beckley 
Editor 

he grievance hearing panel recom- 
mended the reinstatement of lack 
Ryan last week according to a report 
sent to Chancellor Michael Wartell and 
Purdue President Steven Beering. 

"The bearing panel unanimously recom- 
mends that the remedy sought in Ryan's 
grievance be granted, that is, thai ihe Chair of 
the Department of Human Services be autho- 
rized to reappoint Ryan to a teaching position 
at IPFW," the grievance panel concluded 

The panel's recommendation comes nearly 
one year after the university decided not to 
renew Ryan's contract as an instrucior A stu- 
dent who objected io Ryan's comments to her 



in class received $9,500 in the original settle- 
ment. 

The committee consisted of James 
Haddock, associate professor of biology; 
Peter Hamburger, associate professor of 
mathematical sciences; Mitchell Sherr. chair 
and associate professor of organizational 
leadership and supervision: Wayne Unsel. 
chair and associate professor of civil architec- 
ture and engineering technology and Jeffrey 
Wilson, associate professor of psychology 

"The university's decision nol lo reappoint 
Ryan was made in the absence of a pre-depri- 
valion hearing, and ihus violates due 
process," the grievance hearing panel report- 
ed. 

The grievance hearing panel also reported 
that the student's complaint was an informal 



complaint. Ryan's apology and acceptance by 
the student did resolve the informal com- 
plaint, according (o the bearing panel's rec- 
ommendation 

"With this resolution, the matter was 
closed." the panel reported Any further 
action on the complaint would violate (he res- 
olution between the student and Ryan 
Further action would also violaie the "Interim 
Procedures for Handling Complaints of 
Harassment," according to the grievance 
panel. 

"No formal complaint as specified in 
Interim Procedures was ever filed," the panel 
reported 

The panel also said that neither Ihe student 
nor the university had followed proper proce- 
dures in accordance with the anliharassmeni 




policy issued by Wartell 

Wartell will forward the grievance com- 
mittee's recommendation to Beering. 
Beering will then make the final decision 
whether to reinstate Ryan 

Ryan said be was satisfied with the deci- 
sion and intends to return to the university If 
Beering follows the hearing panel's recom- 
mendation. Beering must make a decision 
within 30 days according to the hearing 
panel's formal recommendation. 

"If Beering rules in my favor, I certainly 
plan on it (reluming to IPFW)," Ryan said.

University creates expansion plan 



by CassJt Kilter 
Chief Reporter 



Looking toward Ihe future. 
IPFW's Strategic Planning 
Committee has drafted a plan for 
improvements on campus 

Participants in the planning 
process include Chancellor Michael 
Wartell, the executive staff, the 
speakers of the faculty and the pres- 
ident of Students' GovemmenL 

"The plan was a joint decision." 
said Walter Branson, vice-chancel- 
lor of financial affairs. "We have 
been talking about it for quite some 
lime now " 

The planning process addresses 
seven major issues, including cam- 
pus climate, enrollment manage- 
ment, curriculum, internal/external 
communications, information man- 
agement, resources and staff. 

According to Ihe draft, (he cam- 
pus i iirn.it! plan is (o create a cam- 
pus environment which nol only 
provides students with academic 
support but also provides cultural 
and personal support to help stu- 
dents develop an identity with the 



campus. 

The enrollment management 
plan includes processes which 
would ensure that IPFW successful- 
ly manages enrollment through the 
commitment of staff to recruitmeni 
and retention of students. 

The curriculum plan is to pro- 
mote a process which continually 
responds lo programmatic issues 
based on student and community 
needs. In addition, it is to develop 
new programs and modify existing 
ones. 

The internal/external communi- 
cations plan would budd a partner- 
ship with constituencies in Ihe 
region lo achieve goals, ultimately 
showing Ibe constituents that IPFW 
is deserving of funds To get IPFW 
faculty, administrative staff and stu- 
dents involved as community vol- 
unteers and to have community vol- 
unteers involved in IPFW is the 
ultimate goal of the plan. 

The information management 
plan would provide complete use of 
accurate and up-to-date databases 
of instiiutional information and 
more user-friendly equipment. It 
will make a broad range of commu- 
nication technology more comfort- 



able to use for students and 
employees. 

The resource plan is intended to 
provide adequate resources lo sup- 
port the missions of teaching. 
research and creative endeavor and 
community service at IPFW 

Finally, the committee's staff 
plan is to satisfy the needs of cam- 
pus employees. According to the 
plan, they would be rewarded on 
the basis of mission-related perfor- 
mance measures. 

According to the participants, 
each of the seven Issues has short- 
term, mid-term and long-term 
goals. Short-term goals range from 
one to two years, mid-term goals 
range from two to five years, and 
long-term goals will take more than 
five years. 

However, the participants make 
it clear the draft is flexible, and 
they encourage any suggestions. 

"We are trying to get some cam- 
pus input, so ihe final document 
might actually look a lot different," 
Branson said. 

Students interested in plan 
details can pick up a copy of the 
draft at the Students Government 
office in Walb Union, Room 225.

Kcttler Hall yard and will feature 
flags representing the United 
States, the slate of Indiana, IPFW,

Bible says gays 
are wrong 



To the editor 

This is in response lo the arti- 
cle by Paul Tupper, "Gay people 
are valuable too (Feb. 22. 1996)." 
It is a bit harsh comparing fami- 
lies who discard grown children 
because of their sexuality with 
certain cultures who would kill a 
baby because of its sex or 
because of the family quota. Paul 
slates thai a gay guy named Darin 
was evicted from his parents' 
farm when they found love lellers 
written to a male high-school 
companion ll was slated, he 
moved to Chicago lo find a place 
in ihc openly gay district known 
as Boy's Town. He found a job 
working in a bar. and he longed 
for solidarity and normality! 
( There is nothing nitrmal about a 
.gay lifestyle. 

I know you have heard it said 
before and I quote, "and there is 
no new thing under the sun." (Ec. 
1:9) Homosexuality dales back 
farther than our minds can com- 
prehend. If we would look back 
on history we could see that ii 
was not acceptable to God then 
and surely not now There was 
this place called Sodom, proba- 
bly closely related to the gay dis- 
trict known as Boy's Town. This 
place was destroyed because of 
its life style (Gen. 19:24-25) The 
gay community and its supporters 
want to believe that wrong is 
right and nghl is wrong. 

The world tries to say thai 
being gay is just an alternate life 
style I believe that homosexuali- 
ty is a learned behavior just as 
killing, stealing and adultery I 
also believe that knowing right 
from wrong is like an instinct that 
we are bom with. 

It was also stated in the article 
that Darin was born with an 
uncontrollable desire lo love 
That is wonderful, we need more 
of that in the world today But, 
we must not lose focus on the 
loving in the ngbi way. I love all 
my brothers and friends, bui I 
would not love to go to bed with 



them. I have a brotherly love for 
them, not a romantic love that a 
person would have for (heir 
spouse That should clear up the 
misconception about King David 
and his brother-in-law. Jonathan, 
being gay. Certain gay activists 
have taken II Samuel 1:26 out of 
context. When David speaks of 
Jonathan's love toward him. 
David spoke of Jonathan's extra- 
ordinary friendship in terms of 
their devotion, commitment and 
oneness of purpose Jonathan had 
accepted the Lord's choice of 
David as the next king without 
jealousy or bitterness (I Sam. 
20:13-16). By his right, the 
throne belonged lo Jonathan 

Woman was created lo be a 
partner for man. Their makeup 
equips Ibem lo join with man, 
therefore becoming as one Their 
bodies have been designed to 
produce and sustain life. To sup- 
ply nutrition and love for Iheir 
babies, and to be by man's side 
as his companion. (Gen. 2: 18-23) 
Of course, there is ihe argument 
of gays being bom like they are 
But. I beg lo differ wiih you. 
Why would God pui this in 
someone just lo condemn them? 
Why would he say, "If a man 
also lie with mankind, as he lieth 
wiih a woman, boih of them have 
committed an abomination: they 
shall surely be put to death: their 
blood shall be upon them." (Lev. 
20:13) 

Homosexuality is a sin and nol 
acceptable io God and should not 
be acceptable to us either 1 
believe that all people are vulner- 
able in the site of God. God does 
not hale the sinner, he hates the 
sin I think it is time we take a 
stand for whai is right before we 
fall for what is wrong, and turn 
from our wicked ways All ihose 
who have fallen into that homo- 
sexual trap must repent to insure 
restitution to iheir souls here on 
1- .mli as well as life after death.

The paper dilemma--is a fax machine worth it? 



"Didn't your mother teach you 
how to share?" 

We have all heard the line 
before, but never has anyone 
deserved the question more than Ihe 
department of continuing education. 
For many moons The 
Communicator was allowed to use 
the fax machine for business pur- 



poses for a small fee. But now that 
Walb Union Operations offers fax 
service to students, someone 

thought it would be a great idea if 
The Communicator were to switch 
machines so continuing education 
wouldn't be bothered by a few 
sheets of paper. 

No problem so far. So what if 



we have lo iravel much farther for 
our fax needs 

But what continuing education 
does nol understand is we have 
used its number for many years, and 
it is virtually impossible to contact 
everyone who has it It is not neces- 
sarily our fault that some businesses 
still send us faxes at the continuing 



education number. All of our future 
advertising customers will have the 
new number and that is aboui the 
best we can do. 

So, to the department of continu- 
ing education: learn to play nice. 



University ignores antiharassment policy 



Not to beat a dead horse, but this 
Jack Ryan thing has legs. The 
information keeps coming. It lums 
out neither the student nor the uni- 
versity followed the Antihara- 
ssment Policy as issued by 
Chancellor Michael Warlell, 
Ignorance doesn't justify the mis- 
take, but the university is more al 
fault because the policy was issued 



less than eighteen months ago. And 
ironically it was the universily's 
own policy. 

According to Ihe policy, ihe 
apology offered by Jack Ryan and 
accepted by the accuser "consti- 
tutes a resolution of the informal 
complaint," that this procedure was 
"a negotiated resolution of the 
complaint" and "with this resolu- 



tion, the matter was closed " If you 
remember, The Communicator said 
this twice before. 

With this new information, the 
re-inslatement of Jack Ryan should 
be a sure thing. The grievance com- 
mittee reviewing the case has 
advised Purdue President Steven 
Beering to reinstate Ryan Bccring 
has thirty days to make a decision. 



Docs Beering have the objectivity 

to make this decision? 

We still believe the university 
should end its silence on this issue. 
At the very least ihe university 
should make a move of kindness 
and express compassion for those 
emotionally involved in this case. 



Letters to the editor 



Presidential hopeful tries to clear name 



To the editor, 

This letter is in regards lo the 
IPFW student elections that are tak- 
ing place the week of April 15-19 I 
am currently running for the office 
of student body president Since I 
threw my hat in for the elections 
ibere have been some strange 
occurrences that have happened and 
I believe the student body should be 
aware of one of them. 

Before I begin. I would like to 
quote the 1PSGA Constitution as it 
relates lo the 1PSGA elections 
Article IV, Section II, Paragraph 
four slates. "After the polls close, 
the seal shall be rcinspected by the 
complete election board and at least 
one poll watcher. It shall then be 
secured in the office of Ihc 
University Police until the reopen- 
ing of the polls on the next legal 
voting day." 

I went io watch the closing of 
the polls on Monday, April 15, I 
saw a university official, whom I 
did not know, pick up the ballot box 
and enter the center stairwell I 
could not follow the official for I 
was stopped by another candidate 
who initiated a discussion with me. 
After completing this discussion, I 
attempted to find the ballot box but 
was unsuccessful in doing so. Since 
I knew from the IPSGA 
Consiiiution that the ballot box was 
to be secured in the University 
Police Office, I went there. 

I arrived at the Office of the 
University Police at 5:05 p.m. I 
asked the clerical assistant if the 
student election ballot box had 
arrived al the office. I was told no 1 
waited outside of the police office 
until 6:05 p.m.. bul the ballot box 
never arrived I telephoned the 



office of the dean of student affairs 
to inform Dr. Marian Zimmerman, 
dean of students, that the ballot box 
was not al the Office of ihe 
University Police I was now con- 
cerned with the fact lhal the ballot 
box was somewhere on campus 
other than where it was supposed to 
be, according lo ihe IPSGA 
Constitution. The gentlemen on the 
phone informed me that Dr. 
Zimmerman was nol Ihcre but that 
she would be returning later thai 
evening. 

I left the police office and trav- 
eled to the student government 
office to gel the phone number of 
the student election board so thai 1 
could inform them of the violation. 
After arriving at student govern- 
ment, 1 found Terri Grimm and 
David Uchtman in Tern's office. I 
asked them if they knew the phone 
numbers of the election board for 
the ballot box was missing. Mr. 
Uchtrnan then proceeded to explain 
that Dr Zimmerman had the keys 
to the ballot box and was going to 
count the ballots that nighi. This 
rang another bell in my mind for 
the Consiilulion implies that all the 
votes would be counted at the end 
of ihe election week. 

Mr. Uchtman then led me io the 
Career Services Office, where Dr, 
Zimmerman has her office Though 
ihe Career Services Office was 
closed and the room was dark, Mr 
Uchtman was able to open the door 
because it was unlocked Within Ihe 
office were two young ladies. 
whom Mr Uchtman asked if some- 
one bad picked up the ballot box. 
The ladies did nol know the answer 
bui stated thai I might look on Ihe 
desk of Dr. Zimmerman's secretary 
Mr Uchtman proceeded into ihe 



area occupied by the secretary and 
looked on her desk The ballot box 
was nol there Mr Uchtman then 
turned up the hallway and slopped 
in from of Dr Zimmerman's office 
He then stated, "There is the ballot 
box." 1 walked up the hallway and 
looked into Dr Zimmerman's 
office. There on the desk of ihe 
dean of students were the ballot 
box. blank ballots and ihe listing of 
siudenls used for the election I 
could noi believe my eyes Here, 
accessible to anyone who would 
have opened an unlocked door. 
were the ballot box and blank bal- 
lots jusl sitting out for anyone to 
tamper with. 

Mr. Uchtman and I exiled the 
Career Services Office I went to 
The Communicator office. Finding 
no one available lo witness the 
accessibility of the ballot box and 
ballots. I returned to the Career 
Services Office. I looked inio the 
window and did not see the two 
ladies that had previously been in 
the office I checked the door to see 
if it was locked. Il was not. I again 
entered the career services office to 
see if it was occupied It was not I 
now was in a quandary What was I 
to do for I had discovered: 1) the 
ballot box was not in its official 
place that ii was supposed to be, 
and 2) the ballot box was accessible 
to anyone who would have looked 
for it. 

I stood for a few minutes in Ihe 
Career Services Office to figure oui 
what to do At 6:30 p.m., I decided 
lo call The Communicator and my 
wife, for my investigation into the 
disappearance of the ballot box was 
now running inio a second hour 
After calling home. I decided thai 1 
needed to find a witness to this vio- 



lation of the IPSGA Constitution. 1 
knew thai one of IPSGA judicial 
court's judges was working for 
Walb Union Services and weni in 
search of him. 1 then ran into S, 
Brant Kelley from The 
Communicator and took him into 
the open Career Services Office, 
and then took him lo the door of Dr. 
Zimmerman's office. After he wit- 
nessed this, we exiled the Career 
Services Office I Ihen saw the 
IPSGA judicial member and asked 
him to witness ihe violation. We 
again exited Ihe career services 
office and I went home. 

At 10 p.m. that night I received a 
' call from Chris Douse. He informed 
me that the Election Board was 
going lo look inio allegations that I 
had tampered with the ballot box 
and that I was possibly facing a dis- 
ciplinary review for trespassing into 
the Career Services Office and for 
unauthorized use of university 
property, the telephone, I was livid. 
Here I was trying to find oui why 
the ballot box was missing, finding 
that the ballot box was in an unau- 
thorized place and reporting the 
violation to a judicial member, and 
I am told that I might undergo a dis- 
ciplinary hearing for trying to do 
what was right. 

The next morning. 1 went to the 
police office and found that ballots 
had been laken there some three 
hours after the close of the polls. 
Dr. Zimmerman was also there 
because she and the election board 
were going to count the ballots to 
find out if I tampered with the bal- 
lot box, I then filed an official

Commentary 



A few thoughts about family 




] bave a problem wilh some of 
the discourse surrounding ihe 
debate regarding family values In 
fact. I have a problem with the way 
the family structure is trying with- 
out success to guide the moral 
agenda. Too many people who are 
looking for fast answers to decades- 
ni i in- in ik in,: problems are aiming 
at the wrong group: single parents 

The problems do not lie with 
single parenting as a concept I 
believe those who truly want to be 
a good parent can, regardless of the 
hurdles. I think the real problem 
lies wilh those who mistakenly 
have children when they are truly 
not ready At the age of twenty- 
four, I cannot fathom Ihe workload 
accompanied with parenthood I 
bave too much 1 warn to accom- 
plish. Call me selfish, but I am 
thinking of myself before bringing 
a person uiio the world I can't yet 
handle. I often wonder why others 



haven't made 
sucb consider- 
ations. 
' Pa U l Those 

who are made 
JUpper single parents 

without plan- 
ning surely 
have it rough. 
(%Hty-tu as do those 

who choose 
ffyUp&amp;lG, single parent- 

hood. The last 
thing they 
need are judg- 
mental moralists from the Bible 
Belt breathing down their necks 
and telling them the world will 
inevitably end because they didn't 
provide their children with two par- 
ents Instead of criticizing them, 
why don't we lend them a hand? 
Let's offer to baby-sit when Ihey 
need a break Lei's take their kids 
to the park when we take ours 
Lei's invite them to holiday cele- 
brations Let's carpool to entracur- 
ricular activities. Let's offer help 
with studies when we help our chil- 
dren study. There is so much more 
we can do than blame those who 
are working harder than those of us 
not doing it will ever know 

I also have a problem with many 
of the hetero households which are 
not classified as broken homes 1 
have never met gay parents who 
bave raised children as badly as 
what we are seeing from some bet- 
ero parents today (No. I don'i think 



all hetero parents are bad.) I have 
my reason to think there is a lack of 
quality parenting: we all try so hard 
not to be our parents The truth is. 
in my home, I knew who was the 
boss and what would happen if I 
were to cross that authority Kids 
today do not know this We may 
want to be ihe hippesi parents we 
can be. bui there must be some val- 
ues and disciplines our parents 
bestowed on us that we can use to 
belter shape our youth For some 
reason, gay parents seem to under- 
stand this to a degree hetero parents 
can't even see. The irony is, with 
gay people making such great par- 
ents, the moral majority (whatever 
that is) refuses to think gays can be 
parents. To the Jesse Helms and the 
Jerry Falwells of the world, I say 
this: If you got your head out of 
your Bible you would see gay par- 
ents are doing tremendous things, 
thank you 

I think there is room for families 
of different structures, from single 
parents, to same sex parents, to 
couples who share children. This 
can be hetero parents who have 
divorced, remarried and are now in 
the "step world" or a gay male cou- 
ple who works wilh a lesbian cou- 
ple to raise a child But instead of 
blaming a household for not resem- 
bling the Cleavers', let's pull 
together for a more positive envi- 
ronment. When you tell a child she

Fly Jessica fly 



When she was bom, we named 
her Amelia Today our little girl 
turns seven I remember when she 
was so tiny, I'd throw her high into 
the air She'd grin and giggle I 
didn't want her to be afraid of 
heights, afraid of falling like I was. 
1 took her up in my airplane when 
she was barely six months old, a lit- 
tle wriggly blob in the right seat 
"You're a natural-bom pilot, girl." 
I'd tell her, "a natural-bom pilot." I 
wanted flying to be easier for her 
than it was for me I'm not a natur- 
al-bom pilot. 

Today there's another seven- 
year-old girl in my thoughts as 
well: Jessica Dubroff, killed trying 
to be the youngest pilot to cross the 
continent Yesterday the air waves 
were crackling with angry voices, 
people who know very little about 
aviation and even less about the 
forces moving our nation and our 
culture The same people who bel- 
low aboul competition and winning 
and a parent's right to home school 
and raise children with their own 
values now want to lead a grieving 
mother away in handcuffs 

Had Jessica and her father com- 
pleted the trip, there would have 
been smiley puff pieces and pic- 
tures in "People Magazine." Well, 
they didn't make it. So now we 
want to pass a law and throw some- 
body in jail We worship success.

failure. We bray about competition 

but we don't have Ihe guts to lose. 
We fawn all over the rich and hate 
the poor. So when things get tough. 
we do what it takes to be a success- 
ful rich winner we cheat. 

We're all full of rcctiiudinous 
twaddle about showing initiative. 
In our headlong rush to be winners 
we push our kids into the red line. 
We'll talk about bottom lines in our 
next important meeting, and we 
won't think about the points we had 
to fudge, the comers we had to cut, 
the half-truths we had 10 (ell or the 
people we had to downsize in order 
lo get those record profits. Any 
speck of remorse will be swept 
away by that fat bonus check 
We're winners 

So while you're on the way to 
the bank, think about the losers: 
our children. They don't spend 
their first years wanting to be the 



faslesi or the smartest or the first or 
the richest. They just want to be 
loved. That tragic wreckage in the 
suburbs says a lot about our culture. 
We're so quick to be angry and 
judgmental, we don't have the heart 
and soul lo just be sad any more 
We ask for vengeance without ask- 
ing why. 

Today there's an extra big hug 
for Amelia. There is deepest sym- 
pathy for a grieving mother, sorrow 
for a flight instructor who neglected 
weight, balance and weather 
There's a handshake in thought for 
another Daddy whose big ambitions 
for his baby took his judgment and 
his life. And there's a quiet prayer 
for a little girl who's with (he 
angels now. 

Fly. little Jess. Fly.

Professor draws life lessons from Shakespeare 



by Janet M. Tobey 
Staff Writer 

For Hcrmine van Nuis, associ- 
ate professor of English, the love of 
music, art and poetry is inherent. 
Coming from a family tbal held 
aesthetics and introspection in high 
regard this love of ideas and artistic 
expression is part of her roots 

Van Nuis. who plays the piano, 
sometimes is struck by a melody 
that reminds hex of her past. All at 
once she feels as if she were in her 
parents' living room in Holland 
during World War II. Her earliest 
memories are of those days, when 
her father was in biding from the 
Nazi regime, her mother struggled 
to care for four young children, and 
air raids were a constant reminder 
of imminent danger 

Still, the music in her household 
was a great comfort. Van Nuis par- 
ticularly remembers her brother's 
piano playing 

"During the war, when every- 
one was terrorized, and you never 
knew from one moment to the next 
whether you would be alive or not, 
he would sit quietly at the keyboard 
and play," she said. 

The living room, with its music, 
was an emotional bunker that 
helped her fami- 
ly through the 
toughest of 
times. Later, in 
the still difficult 
post-war years, 
the van Nuis 
children would 
play piano and 
recorder there 
together. 

The city, 's- 
Hertogenbosch, 
suffered much 
damage during 
the war. but the 
van Nuis family 
survived. They 
moved to the US 
after the war and 
settled in Grand 
Rapids, Mich. 
As a survivor, van Nuis came to 
appreciate her time on earth, when 
others, not so fortunate, were killed. 

"We have learned that life is a 
precious thing. Many people's lives 
were snuffed out all of a sudden. 
We still have ours— and I say use 
it," van Nuis said. 

These days, as a professor at 
IPFW. van Nuis still does not like 
to waste lime. She prepares exten- 
sively for each class in order lo use 
every moment of class lime cover- 
ing the many aspects of the poetry 
and prose. But a good sense of 
humor helps, 

"We use our class time wisely, 
but that doesn't mean long-faced 
seriousness." van Nuis said. "I 




believe learning should be fun." 

Van Nuis' dedication to her 
field of study carries over into her 
time away from the office and the 
classroom. Sometimes, she said, 
she sits quietly, without even a 
book, and does die hardest work of 
the day: her inner work. 

One of ihe benefits of being a 
literature professor, said van Nuis, 
is that you can learn more and more 
about who you are. Students of van 
Nuis become aware of the injunc- 
tion of the Delphic oracle. One of 
the three inscriptions on the ancient 
temple is "Know Thyself," an 
imperative van Nuis believes to be 
of utmost importance. 

"Wisdom comes from learning 
to know oneself," van Nuis said. "If 
we become attuned to who we our- 
selves are, we can face a lot in life. 
It is a challenge, because we (end to 
run away from who we really are. It 
takes courage to confront what is 
inside, because you never know 
what will pop up on the surface." 

As an example of one character 
in literature who runs away from 
himself, van Nuis thinks of 
Oedipus, in the play "Oedipus the 
King." 

Within the literature van Nuis 
teaches are many life lessons, if you 
know bow to 
analyze them. 
She shares these 
lessons with her 
students. The 
tragedies and 
comedies she 
discusses with 
5u^_ her classes pro- 

vide opportuni- 
ties for students 
to find the uni- 
versal truths in 
the classic 
works. Van 
Nuis helps them 
along in learn- 
ing from the 
characters' mis- 
takes and 
virtues. 

"Prospero, in Shakespeare's 'The 
Tempest,' learned to come to terms 
with things inside, in the end, when 
he threw away his magic," van Nuis 
said. The magic had been his way 
of escaping himself. He let it go, 
and we all have to learn to let go." 

Van Nuis said she is glad she 
became a professor of English. She 
has always loved poetry. 

"I come by my love of poetry 
very honesdy," said van Nuis. "My 
mother used to do poetry readings 
when we lived in Holland." 

As an undergraduate at Calvin 
College, van Nuis thought about 
becoming a physician, like her 
older brother. It seemed a valuable 
thing to do, she said, to help people. 



Her sister's fiancS convinced her to 
stay with poetry, however, and she 
has always been glad she did. 

"It is such a rewarding profes- 
sion to constantly read beautiful 
stuff and talk about it." van Nuis 
said. "What 1 like most aboui my 
profession is the actual teaching. I 
put a great deal of time into prepar- 
ing for my classes, even with some- 
thing I've taught a number of times. 
I always try to do something new 
with it." 

And the students? "You can't 
escape them once you're in this 
profession," joked van Nuis. "I'll be 
in a restaurant, and a student from 
years ago will come up to me and 
say, 'Do you remember me? Don't 
you remember that day I talked to 
you?' Sometimes they tell me they 
were really moved by something I 
said, helped them change direction; 
it makes me feel very good." 

Van Nuis won the IPFW 
Outstanding Teacher Award in 
1990. The award is a distinguishing 
honor that a professor can win only 
once in his or her career. She joy- 
ously celebrated the award with 
family members, who gathered for 
a "Dutch celebration," with feasting 
and drinking wine. 

She sees her career as making a 
small difference to improve the 
world, she said. She hopes that her 
classes will help students with the 
search for self-knowledge, and 
finds that they often are surprised 
by how much they like the classic 
works. Some students begin the 
course in Milton thinking the mate- 
rial will be dull but find the class to 
be fun and interesting, 

"I don't expect all the students 
to like literature, but 1 hope they all 
leave my class with a respect for lit- 
erature," said van Nuis. "We are 
talking about beautiful art and sucb 
important ideas." 

The work that teachers do, even 
things like grading papers, all ! 
together to make the world a better 
place, said van Nuis. Feedback to 
students is especially important. 

"I think we need quality people 
in the classroom, people who can 
make students excited about learn- 
ing, get them interested. Teaching is 
a very creative thing lo do," said 
van Nuis. "Even though you have 
mapped out in your mind what you 
want to cover on a particular day, 
you should be able lo go a number 
of ways with it during the class." 

While her specialty is 17th-cen- 
tury poelry, she also loves medieval 
poetry and art. Twelve art prints of 
medieval knights decorate tier 
office, along with a print of a cathe- 
dral's stained-glass window. The 
style reminds her of the city in 
Holland where she grew up. 

Van Nuis last visited her home- 
land in 1985. which was the 800ih

Good Day Sunshine 

Students enjoy Spring Carnival 



by Amanda Manlon, 

Features Editor, 

and Sara Valentine, Photo Editor 

If any Mastodon had a lire-long 
wish to become a human bowling 
ball, his or her wish was granted 
last Friday at the Spring Carnival 
Students stopped by to enjoy the 
sunshine and attractions. 

The Student Activities Board 
provided amusements outside of 
Walb Union for the event. Students 
had their choice of barreling down 



a concrete bowling alley in a game 
of human bowling or launching 
their body at a Velcro wall in an 
attraction called the "Fly Trap." 

Students also had the option of 
racing one another in lanes of air- 
filled plastic. The object of the race 
was to place a Velcro-covered 
baton on a strip farther than the 
other racer could place his or her 
baton Sounds simple enough, 
right? Wrong. Racers were attached 
to bungee cords and were ordered 
at a certain point in the race to 



"dig" their feet into the air cush- 
ioned floor. When the supervisor of 
the event yelled dig. racers fell 
themselves snapped back like a 
released rubber band and fell into 
the cushioning behind them. 

Mitesh Mehtah. a freshman 
chemistry major, almost had a nasty 
run-in when some overzealous 
bowlers rolled him out of the 
human bowling lane, but said he 
enjoyed the game nonetheless. 

"The bowling thing, that was 
fun, but the ball needed to be a litde 



bigger for some guys," Mehtah 
said. 

President of Student Activities 
Erin Fridh, organizer of the event. 
said that her main purpose was to 
bring all of the student organiza- 
tions together in one event. 

SAB also hired a professional 
juggling act to entertain students 
SAB successfully provided a spring 
oasis from the routine of classes 
and studies. 

"I'm just glad it didn't rain," 
Fridh said.

"HBlp me! Help me!" cries Mrtesh Mehtah as he hangs helplessly upside down after hurdling his body 
on the velcro llytrap."

Students investigate local job possibilities 



by Rebecca Km 
Staff Reporter 



Prospective graduates took a 
long look at the local job market on 
Thursday, April 11. Career Expo 
'96 at the Grand Wayne Center, 

The Career expo was directed 
toward students graduating from 
college ibis fall as well as those 
already holding degrees. Career 
Expo '96 was co-hosted by Indiana 
Institute of Technology, 
Internationa] Business College. Ivy 
Tech State College, Saint Francis 
College, Taylor Universiiy at Fort 
Wayne. Tri-State University and 
the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers 

The day began with the First of 
two motivational speeches given by 
Bill MacDonald. MacDonald is the 
President of Maui 1. a company 
specializing in many areas of 
employment. 

In his presentation, MacDonald 
stressed verbal communication 
skills. When he worked in industry 
as an employer, he said the best 
position he ever Filled was with a 
candidate without the best creden- 
tials but with good communication 
skills. 

MacDonald's success demon- 



strates his own communication 
skills, especially since many do not 
realize he succeeded without 
receiving a college degree. 
MacDonald explained another vital 
component of finding a job: "If you 
are nice to people they will help 
you." 

After listening to MacDonald's 
speech, people attending the job fair 
visited booths representing different 
employers. Over fifty employers 
attended die job fair hoping to fill a 
vaneiy of positions. 

For some, finding qualified can- 
didates was simplified by tbe 
career expo. "It's harder to get 
engineering personnel through our 
normal means of advertising," said 
Chuck Weiss of Rennco, Inc. The 
company usually uses newspaper 
classified sections as well as other 
local media to advertise job open- 
ings, according to Weiss. 

"We wanted to get more expo- 
sure," Julie Grass from Nishikawa 
Standard Company said. She said 
the company was successful in its 
goal. They spoke to one person 
every five or 10 minuies according 
to Grass and her associate, Eric 
Hochsteller. 

Shambaugh &amp; Sons reported 
similar success. "It turns out to be a 
resume every 3 minutes for me so 
far," Megan Siegnanh said. 



Tbe Career Expo's success was 
also seen at the registration table. 
"So far it looks like we got more 
people than last year." said Darrin 
Blackwell of International Business 
College Blackwell worked last 
year's fair and this year's. He also 
helped plan the fair. 

People seeking careers also 
seemed to find Career Expo '96 
beneficial. "It's a time-saver," said 
Theresa Enea, a May '94 graduate 
from IPFW in Marketing and 
Management. "You can actually 
meet the people. Your first impres- 
sion is very important." she said. 

Michael Evans, who graduated 
with a bachelor's degree in commu- 
nications last year from IPFW. also 
found the fair to be positive. "I've 
met some people, made some dif- 
ferent contacts. There may be a few 
different places that would work." 
he said. This was the first career 
expo Evans had attended. 

While the career expo received 
positive comments from those in 
aiiendance. Jennifer Bouffard from 
Indiana Institute of Technology was 
disappointed. "1 thought it could be 
more oriented toward college stu- 
dents. It was mosdy for older peo- 
ple, full time," she said. She plans 
to graduate from Indiana Institute 
of Technology in business manage- 
ment in 1997. 



Local professor mentors young area students 



by Cassie Ritter 
Chief Reporter 

George Mourad, assistant pro- 
fessor of biology, mentored Laura 
Walker, a Homestead student who, 
with Mourad's guidance, won big 
at the annual science fair. Mourad 
offered his guidance and supervi- 
sion, research funds, and lab space 
as pan of his volunteer service to 
Fon Wayne secondary education 
students. 

The project Mourad and Walker 
worked on for nearly five months 
was called "Green Remediation: 
Exploring the Mechanisms of 
Pbytoremediation in Arabidopsis 
Tbaliana " Walker won eight 
awards for the project and will go 
on to compete at the Hoosier 
Science and Engineering Fair in 
Indianapolis during April and the 
International Science and 
Engineering Fair in Tucson, 
Arizona in May. 

According to Mourad, "Green 
Remediation" is using plants to 
clean up contamination and pollu- 
tion in the soil. Mourad and Walker 
performed a genedc search to select 
plants that have been mutantized: 
that is, plants whose genes have 
changed, Mourad produced a 



mutant plant which would overpro- 
duce a chelating protein. Chelating 
protein enables the plant to bind 
with protein. 

"I produced one plant that has 
high amounts of a chelating proiein, 
and therefore the plant is able to 
uptake metal from the soil without 
affecting the plants functions." 
Mourad said. "This way we can use 
plants in cleaning up contaminated 
soils with high amounts of heavy 
metals." 

The mutant plant can be planted 
in soil which has high amounts of 
heavy metals. The plant uptakes the 
heavy metals in the soil, ultimately 
removing any harmful contamina- 
tion from the ground. 

"I'm producing mutant plants 
that are able to take excessive 
amounts of metal in and live with it 
without it causing any harm to the 
plant," Mourad said. 

According to Mourad, the pro- 
ject is an environmentally safe way 
to clean up contaminated soil. 
Other than being a safe way lo 
clean up contamination, the project 
also can be used for mining. 

"The plants can be collected and 
bumed in a furnace, and then the 
remaining ashes would contain high 
amounts of metal," Mourad said. 



Department needs 
revamping, retooling 



by Cassie Rider 
Chief Reporter 

Academic counseling in the 
department of education is in des- 
perate need of an overhaul, accord- 
ing to students in the department 
Several students have expressed 
frustration with the lack of cohe- 
sive ness within the department. 

"I did not seek my adviser 
because she makes me feel like an 
idiot," said an elementary education 
major who wished lo remain 
anonymous. 

She also said the counseling 
department suffers from a lack of 
organization and that it has mis- 
placed her registration form, which 
prevented her from enrolling in the 
classes she needed. 

Misplaced forms and files is 
nothing new for the education 
department, said another elemen- 
tary education major, who preferred 
to remain anonymous. She said the 
department lost her complete acad- 
emic file, and neither she nor the 
department was able to find it. 

According to David Skelton, 
associate professor of education, he 
has beard comments but is not sure 
of the nature of the problem 



"I guess I have heard some com- 
ments, but I wasn't totally aware." 
Skelton said. "I'm not sure I could 
give you much background." 

Nearly all education majors 
interviewed said the only way to 
get information was from other stu- 
dents or from Ray Graves, licens- 
ing adviser 

"Nobody tells you anything," 
another student who remains 
anonymous. "You have to figure it 
out on your own." 

When asked if anything is being 
done to remedy the problem, 
Skelton said, "I do know that dur- 
ing the course of the year, with a lot 
of new people and new deans and 
so forth, there has been a lot of 
planning done and a lot of effon to 
try to find out just bow tbe students 
feel about tilings, so they can be 
dealt with. 

"I think that there is a genuine 
effon being put forth to try to find 
out what is wrong I dunk there will 
be solutions once there are things 
identified that need to be taken care 
of." 



"If the metals are precious metals, 
they can then be used for other pur- 
poses." 

Mourad does not know if his 
"Green Remedialion" idea has been 
attempted in other parts of the 
country as well. If Mourad gets the 
funding he needs to continue his 
research, he will attempt to clone 
the mutant gene into larger plants 
that will enable faster clean-up of 
contaminated soil. 

Mourad would eventually like lo 
be able to use the mutated plants lo 
clean up the zinc cadnium dumped 
in Fort Wayne in the 1960s. 

"It's a local problem and I'm 
trying lo do a service to my com- 
munity by trying to clean up some 
of the mess that was done here in 
the 60s," Mourad said. "The 
amouni of money spent by the EPA 
is millions, and imagine the amouni 
of chemicals that are left behind 
that we might not know about today 
that might be toxic to us in a few 
years." 



Panel 

continued from page I 

"The panel spelled out its recom- 
mendation in such a way that I 
think Beering would have trouble 
reversing it," Ryan added. 

He also said he was surprised by 
the amouni of coverage his case 
received from the media and by the 
amount of negative response One 
university endured. 

Ryan filed a grievance with the 
university when his contract was 
not renewed after the 1995 spring 
semester During thai semester, he 
referred to an African-American 
woman as "a big, black woman." 

According lo the student. Joyce 
Gaines. Ryan made the reference 
three limes. Gaines said Ryan had 
crossed the line of teacher-siudeni 
relations. 

"He said, 'Wouldn't you be 
intimidated by a big. black woman 
like Joyce,'" Gaines said. She 
added that the class was laughing 
and said she fell humiliated. 

"Thai's not true at all," Ryan 
said. 

Ryan said he only referred to 
Gaines as "a big, black woman" 
once He said he made the com- 
ment when he was telling ihe class 
lo identify themselves better or else 
they would be remembered by how 
they looked. 

Gaines also said she almost 
withdrew from IPFW after the inci- 
dents. 

"I was gready wronged, the con- 
flict was in using me as an illustra- 
tion in class." Gaines said. 

"He said, 'You need to learn 
how lo talk white ... You dress the 
part bul you just don't fit ihe 
image," Gaines said. 

"No one needs lo be heated ihe 
way I was treated. " Gaines said. 



Ryan has repeatedly denied thai 
he (old Gaines to "talk white." 

The human services class met at 
the sian of the semester and then 
the students were divided between 
two instructors Gaines and another 
African -American woman went to 
Ryan's section Gaines said Ryan 
moved the African-American 
woman to Ihe other section. 

"He said, T put her in ihe other 
section because I couldn't take Ihe 
both of you together,'" Gaines said. 
Ryan said Gaines requested that 
the other African- American woman 
be placed with her in class. 

On April 3, 1995. Gaines said 
she approached Frank Borelli, vice 
chancellor of student affairs, and 
Fred Kirehoff, vice chancellor of 
academic affairs to talk about the 
incidents On April 15, 1995, 
Gaines began to lake ibe class 
through independent sludy with 
Mary Scuddcr. 

"At that lime I fell even more 
alienated." Gaines said. 

Gaines, who said she is a recov- 
ering drug addict, received her 
Associate's degree in Human ser- 
vices and is now working toward a 
Bachelor of Arts in social work ai 
St. Francis College 

Gaines said she worked at Dana 
for 14 years before she developed a 
drug problem and still receives a 
pension from the company. She 
also said she was involved with the 
PTA and served as den mother for 
ihe Girl Scouts. 

Gaines said she knew if she 
spoke oui about what bad happened 
in her class her past police record 
would be revealed. She said she 
committed the crimes lo support 
her drug habit but said she has been 
clean of drugs for ihe last 10 years 
"I'm not living in the past I 
wish the media would slop living in 
it," Gaines said.

"Inscribed bricks will cost S96

league, Ervin "Magic" Johnson, has 
landed himself in hot water with 
actions mirroring those of Rodman 
and Van Exel. 

Johnson argued with, charged 
and bumped referee Scoti Foster 
late in the first half of Sunday's 
game against the Suns. To his cred- 
it, Johnson apologized to those con- 
cerned and accepted ihe league's 
reprimand Johnson was fined 
S10.000 and will miss three games 
as a result of the push, 

The question here is not a matter 
of "oops I am sorry." however. It's 
a question of respeel or more pre- 
cisely a lack thereof. 

In an age of disrespect and lofty 
ainiudes, respeci has evaporated 
like a drop of water on hoi pave- 
ment. No longer is the word of a 
referee or umpire regarded as being 
unquestionable. We do not have the 



players lo blame here, though The 
antics of the players are merely a 
minor image of the thoughtless dis- 
regard for ihe law that has infected 
society. 

The sad epilogue to this story is 
the effect upon America as a whole. 
Society has already begun writing 
its own exceptions (o the rules, 
exceptions that Til each episode dif- 
ferently according to who is 
involved At a time when passing 
the buck and not accepiing one's 
responsibilities runs rampant, pro- 
fessional sports seems lo be taking 
its place in the line. It is lime for 
these athletes to begin accepting ihe 
role that has been thrust upon them. 

Like ii or not, professional ath- 
letes serve as role models and 
heroes (o a great number of our 
youth Charles Barkley recently 
spoke out against such roles in a 



Nike commercial. The problem is 
he was dead wrong Here is a group 
of overpaid athletes who are fortu- 
nate to live and play in a game that 
they love. The money isn't the issue 
here, any red-blooded American 
would gladly accept half the salary 
mosl of these guys are paid. If the 
players don't like the facl that they 
have become this generation's John 
Wayne, maybe they ought to get out 
of the spotlight. Maybe Uicy ought 
to try and earn a living like the rest 
of us. 

The ugly antics displayed by 
players like Van Exel. Rodman and 
Johnson need lo cease. Just because 
you are given a driver's license, il 
doesn't give you the right to go oui 
and crash into the next guy who 
cuts you off on the expressway. So 
what gives these athletes the right 
lo blatantly ignore the rules of the 



game and take their frustrations out 
on the nearest referee? 

There used lo be a joke that 
mentioned going to a fight and 
watching a hockey game break out. 
Sadly, the same can now be said of 
Ihe NBA The National Hockey 
League pui a slop lo the violence in 
its game by stiffly penalizing play- 
ers for fighting I am not recom- 
mending thai the NBA install penal- 
ly boxes at counside, bui something 
needs lo be done lo discourage bas- 
ketball players from losing control 
at the sound of every whistle. If 
these so-called superstars want to 
light, maybe ihey should lace up the 
gloves and hop into the ring with 
Mike Tyson,

improve on one of the league's 
worst passing games. In addition 
Ihe Jaguars had trouble scoring, 
and Johnson is a real gamebreaker. 
Arizona Cardinals: Wh3f can I 
say, you can't polish a turd. The 
Cardinals need everything, espe- 
cially a quarterback. However, the 
team also needs massive offensive 
line help and will draft UCLA tack- 
le Jonathan Ogdcn to protect 
whichever 35-ycar-old quarterback 
the Cardinals are using this season. 
Baltimore Ravens: The Ravens 
have no running game at all. so 
they will take their chances with 
troubled Nebraska star Lawerence 
Phillips Phillips has too much tal- 
ent to pass up and will take some 
pressure off Vinny Testaverdc. 
New York Giants: The last time 
the Giants drafted this high they 
chose Lawerence Taylor. Illinois' 
Kevin Hardy has been called the 
second coming of LT, so the Giants 



will give him 
a shot to 
shore up a 
Tr&lt;l Vi S poor defense 

' St. Louis 

Stanl Rams: The 

Rams got this 
pick from the 
{* * Redskins for 

/* tnt Sean Gilbert 

%&lt;Htt f ° r reasons 

they are not 
yet disclosing. 
1 think Jerome 
Betlis is out 
as running back, and the team will 
draft Texas A&amp;M speedster 
Leeland McElroy. But for now, all 
plans are hush-hush. 
New England Patriots: Decisions, 
decisions. Does Bill Parcells draft a 
receiver, in the form of Ohio 
State's Terry Glenn, to help Drew 
Bledsoe ? Not a chance. Parcells is 
a defensive coach and will finally 
end his four-year search for a play- 
er like Taylor to rush the passer in 
Illinois' Simeon Rice. 
Carolina Panthers: The Panthers 
arc also desperate for a running 
back, and Michigan's Tim 
Biakabutuka is a perfect fit for their 
power attack If Biakabutuka is 
gone, the team will take massive 
running back Stephen Davis or 
Kutztown State linebacker Eric 
Mobely to eventually replace Sam 
Mills, who is retiring after next 
year 

Houston Oilers: Coach Jeff Fisher 
loves his defense, so that is where 
the team will draft Baylor's Daryl 
Gardner is a risk, but he is just too 
good to pass up. He can play tackle 
or end to fill either hole on the 
Oilers front four. He may have a 
motivation problem, but Fisher will 
fix that 

Cincinnati Bengals: Another no 
brainer, The Bengals have been 
awe-struck with Aubum offensive 
tackle Willie Anderson since be left 
school early. Anderson will be the 
next great tackle in Cincy, rekin- 
dling memories of Anthony 
Munoz. Anderson will provide the 
much needed blocking for Ki-Jana 
Carter. 

These picks are by no means 
cast in stone, as many of the teams 
are still talking of trading down. 
Two teams that 1 would not be sur- 
prised to see trade up are the 
Chargers and 49'ers. Each has 
pressing needs and should use draft 
day wizardry to get what they want. 
This year's draft is deep in talent, 
so I would recommend that no one 
miss the 17 hours of coverage on 
ESPN and ESPN2.

The men's volleyball team will 
compete for the Midwest 
Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association Championship at 
Ohio Stale this weekend. 

The 'Dons are coming off of a 
very inspiring weekend after near- 
ly defeating us first nationally 
ranked opponent this season On 
Saturday evening ihe 'Dons nearly 
upset Lewis in a tough five-game 
match. 



After losing the opening game 
of the match, the Mastodons won 
games two and three in a decisive 
manner. In game four the 'Dons 
lost momentum and eventually the 
match. 

The 'Dons opening-round 
opponent in the MIVA tourney 
will be those same Lewis Flyers.

the regular season standings while 
the Flyers finished third

penHert for on-court 
outburst 

L.A. Lakers all-star Magic 
Johnson called his three-game and 
$10,000 fine justified punishment 
for on-courl actions during 
Sunday's game against Phoenix. 

Johnson bumped an official 
while disputing a no-call as he 
drove to the basket. 

The incident came just five days 
after Johnson publicly chastised 



teammate Nick Van Excl, who 
received a seven-game suspension 
for shoving a referee 

To his credit. Johnson apologized 
for his outburst and accepted the 
punishment for his actions.

NASCAR milestone... 

NASCAR driver Terry Labonte 
achieved racing's equivalent of an 
ironman award as he lied Richard 
Petty for the most consecutive races 
started with 513. Labonte's record 
began in 1979 

Adding icing to the cake, 
Labonte outran Jeff Gordon to the 
finish line to capture his first win of 
the 1996 season and his 17th career 
Winston Cup victory 

He also picked up the UNOCAL 
bonus- a $129,200 check for win- 
ning the race from the pole position. 



Nashville W Haters? 
ESPN report n\ay 
be fLshy... 

ESPN reported Monday that 
Nashville. Tenn may become the 
new home of the NHL Hartford 
Whalers as early as next week 

Nashville, which came close to 
"stealing" the Devils from New 
Jersey last season, is desperate to 
bring a hockey team to the Music 
City. 

League sources cited by ESPN 
said Nashville has offered to pay 
the NHL S20 million as compensa- 
tion for the loss of a possible expan- 
sion site in Tennessee. 

The Whalers are under contract 
to stay in Connecticut through 
1997-98, but team owners have 
indicated they might be interested 
in moving the team should a "Save 
the Whalers" season ticket cam- 
paign fall short of its 11,000 target 
by May 1 The team has not dis- 
closed the number of season tickets 



ifc^ 



already sold, but it is expected to do 
so by early next week. 

Pacers playoff 

potential rests on 



Miller ' s 



eye... 



Indiana Pacers guard Reggie 
Miller is expected to miss between 
two or three weeks of action due to 
surgery to repair the bone beneath

Miller sustained a fracture to the 
otbit bone of his right eye socket in 
a freak collision with Detroit's Otis

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. What's the point of 
HIV testing? If you've 
got HIV, you're going to 
die "before your time" 
and why would anyone 
want to know that? 

A. Medicines are now 
available that can prolong 
the period of good health 
and prevent illness in 
people with HIV. Better 
treatments and possibly a 
cure may be found before 
those now infected get sick 
or die. Also, if you are 
infected, you must take 
precautions not to infect 
others.
