*^Fort,^ theatres have mock elections 



Reagan leads polls 



BY DEBBIE 

CANTWELL 

If the coffee drinkers, sandwich 
eaters, yogurt lovers and salad crun- 
chers — otherwise, the customers of 
The Fort — elected a president on Oct. 
7, they would have picked Republican 
candidate Ronald Reagan. 

Reagan captured 30 percent of the 
vole in the ARA Presidential Preview 
conducted by ARA Food Services 
during the Oct. 7 lunch hour in the Walb 
Memorial Union cafeteria. 

President Jimmy Carter followed in 
the mock election with 25.8 percent of 
the vote, and Independent candidate 
John Anderson was third with 24.7 
percent. In addition, 14.1 percent of the 
voters were undecided, while 5.4 per- 
cent opted for "other" candidates. 

Customers filled out ballots as they 
entered the cafeteria, said John 
Herring, operations manager of ARA of 
Fort Wayne, and deposited them in a 
box when they paid for their food. 

Over 150 cu'itomers voted in the mock 



election between 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 
p.m., said Herring, who added, nearly 
500 customers patronized The Fort that 
day, 

"I thought for a college operation 
we'd get more (voters)," Herring 
commented. "I thought there''" be more 
interest." 

Reagan also leads the national 
results of Straw PoL '80, a straw poll 
conducted by the General Cinema 
theatre chain. 

Reagan had 40.1 percent of the votes 
as of Oct. 8, followed by Carter with 31 
percent and Anderson with a 28.7 
percent share. 

There were 1,166,921 votes cast 
between Sept. 1 — when the poll began 
— and Oct. 7. 

Movie-goers who purchased a soft 
drink at participating General Cinema 
theatres were given a choice of Reagan, 
Carter or Anderson straws from which 
to choose. The customer was given a 
straw, and the number of straws 



handed out was tabulated by each In- 
dividual theatre. 

In Indiana, Reagan led with 43.33 
percent of the vole. Carter followed 
with a 29.62 percent share, and 
Anderson with a 27.05 percent of the 
vote. A total of 114,355 movie-goers in 
the Hoosier state have responded to the 
poll. 

Electoral college votes tabulated by 
the movie theatres had Reagan ahead 
in 31 states, with 376 electoral votes, 
Anderson leading in five states and 
Washington, D.C. with 93 electoral 
votes, and Carter the favorite in two 
states with 17 electoral votes. 

General Cinema has conducted the 
Straw Poll each preisdential election 
year since 1968. hi 1976, the final straw 
tabulation came within one percentage 
point of the actual election results. 

General Cinema operates 340 
theatres with 875 screens in 38 states 
and Washington, D.C, making it the 
largest motion picture exhibitor in the 
country.

Constitution still in air 



BV DENNIS KITE 

The Student Senate went into over- 
time last Wednesday in a marathon 
meeting in hopes of ratifying the new 
Student Body Constitution. 

Ratification, however, was not 
achieved. 

The Constilution was presented to the 
senators by Steve Westrick, one-of-two 
members of the Constitution Com- 
mittee. 

The problem started when it was 
realized that the document was not in 
its finished form. Westrick, himself, 
added over 40 amendments and 
resolutions to the "finished" product 
during the meeting. 

The most time-consuming item 
during the meeting was the manner in 
which the resolutions were presented. 

Each resolution had to be spelled out 
to the letter by Westrick and then 
opened for debate. The debate con- 
sisted, a majority of the time, to 
Westrick's explanation of why the 
change had to be made. A vote was then 
taken for approvaL Only once during 



the two-hour-and-fifteen-minute 
meeting was a "nay" vote voiced. "And 
that was done purely out of boredom," 
said Jeff Sandy, a student senator. 

Sandy voiced his opinion about the 
process of ratifying the Constitution in 
a very vehement manner. "This joke 
(the drafting of a new Constitution) 
began last April, It doesn't do a god- 
damned thing for the students," Sandy 
said. 

Sandy sees the process of drafting 
and ratifying the Constitution as a 
waste of time. He believes there are 
other more important items with which 
the Senate must deal. "We don't even 
have to have a Constitution," he said. 

Sandy was concerned about the 
image the students have of the Senate 
because of this constitutional con- 
troversy. "This is what Steve Westrick 
is about," Sandy pointed out. "This is 
not what the Student Senate is about." 

Two sheets of constitutional 
resolutions were presented to Westrick 
by Sandy over a month ago. However, 
these resolutions were never drafted 
into the Constitution, They were 



presented as separate resolutions 
during the meeting. 

Westrick defended his committee and 
his draft of the Constitution by saying 
that "things have come up and have 
been discussed since the draft of the 
Constitution was typed." He said that 
there was just not enough time to re- 
type the whole Constitution. 

Westrick doesn't look on the Con- 
stitution as a joke. "It's not the main 
thing we (the Senate) are doing," 
Westrick said. "But I feel it's im- 
portant." 

The present Constitution lacks detail, 
according to Westrick. The Constitution 
as it stands now states that a senator 
has only three duties. "Our duties are 
much more encompassing than that," 
Westrick said. 

Westrick understands the turmoil 
within the Senate over the time that it's 
taking to ratify the Constitution. "But 
it's something that has to be done," 
Westrick explained. "Unfortunately, 
it's taking more time than any of us 
want it to."

Coats, Walda trade insults 



By DENNIS KITE 

This being an election year, we are 
all growing accustomed to the 
political jabs and punches flying 
about from candidates competing 
for various seats and offices. 

Monday, IPFW was given just a 
small taste of that side of politics 
when it hosted a forum with 
Republican Dan Coats and 
Democrat John Walda (both running 
for the 4th District congressional 
seat I as guests. The forum spon- 



sored by The Communicator and 
Campus Ministries, was Intended to 
allow the candidates a chance to 

further explain their positions on 
various subjects. It ended up as a

with calm words.

inept one ever." 

Coats then launched his attack on 
Congress itself by saying that since 
1955, when the Democrats took 
control of Congress, the inflation 
rate has escalated from less than

turn. ( Photo by Larry JMcFadden) 



Bolh candidates agreed that the 
nation is facing a crisis, and the 
stale of the economy is the root of all 
evil in America, this is about all they 
agreed upon. 

"Millions of American workers 
are out of work," Coats said. "The 
energy policy has left this nation 
with a 50 percent dependence on 
foreign nations." 

Walda echoed his opponent for the 
congressional seat by saying that 
the economy is merely one of "many 
things wrong in America today." 

Tlie Democratic hopeful listed 
synthetic fuels and job programs for 
"the chronically unemployed, those 
who have been discriminated 
against and the elderly and the 
young" as answers to the double- 
digit inflation. 

Walda also claimed that the 
Republican's answer to a balanced 
budget was nothing more than "a 
fairytale." 

Coats began his verbal abuse of 
the Democratic party with a jab at 
the President. "The record of 
Jimmy Carter over the past four

that it now has. 

The two congressional hopefuls 
united again when the discussion 
turned to the Equal Rights Amen- 
dment. 

Coats denounced his party's 
refusal to accept the ERA as a plank 
in its platform. He believes that his 
"party should have taken a stand 
one way or the other." 

Walda vehemently said, "I'll 
support it (ERA) until it is passed." 

Both candidates admitted that the 
country's defense budget needs to be 
increased. More benefils and higher 
wages for Armed Forces personnel 
were at the top of their lists. Neither 
Croats nor Walda were able to come 
up with a quck solution as to where 
the money would come from for such 



Many questions were asked by the 
audience, but only a ^ew direct 
answers were given by the can- 
didates. The results of this 4th 
District race will be interesting, 
especially when the candidates have 
so little to say to the voting public. 



Six discover Indiana, IPFW 



By KARI-JAV SMITH 

On a sunny 68-degree fall day last 
week, one IPFW student was shivering 
in his long Johns, two others were 
wondering why Indiana doesn't have 
any mountains, and another wistfully 
wanted to say "Hi" to the folks back 
home. 

These four students and two others 
left homes as far away as Hawaii and 
New York to study at IPFW as mem- 
bers of the National Student Exchange 
Program (NSE). 

Seated near the fireplace in their 
dorm on the Concordia Theological 
Seminary campus, they talked about 
life in Indiana. 



Douglas "George" Saylor, from 
Albuquerque, New Mexico, is the one 
who was cold. He came stamping and 
shivering into the dorm, wearing a 
corduroy coat, hat and scarf, saying, 
"It's freezing out there," He took off his 
boot to show off his heavy socks and 
long Johns. 

"A5 far as I'm concerned, it's win- 
ter," he said. So why did he come here? 

"I was crazy, insane. No, seriously, 
Indiana University has a good 
renutation— one of the Ion 10." he said, 
pulling his coat a little tighter about 
him. "We're not really serious when we 
say how much we hate it here. We're 
just Joking." Before the interview was 



over, he had started a fire in the 
lounge's fireplace and said that he 
really did like it here. 

When Leslie "Lester" Clegg, from 
Raleigh, North Carolina, said, "I've 
never been to such a flat place," 
everyone started talking about what 
they missed from back 
home— mountains, sunshine and the 
ocean beach were at the top of the list, 
along with food for Douglas and Cyn- 
thia "weed-short for seaweed" Inoue 
from Honolulu, Hawaii, No one could 
recall howshe got her nickname. 

Cynthia chose Indiana "because it is 
different from Hawaii,"

Youthful offend er confesses to l ife of crime 



C. 1980. ROBERT RINEARSON 

In part two of Robert Rinearson's 
series on yoijth crime in Fort Wayne, 
one youthful offender relates his story 
in an interview taped while he was 
being questioned by authorities. All but 
one of the events, facts and names are 
real. The name of the youth, Terry in 
the story, has been changed due to 
current charges pending against him. 

Terry is a professional felon. 

He committed his first burglary at 
the age of 13, and by the time he 
reached 18, Allen County police 
estimated his total criminal take to be 
between 8100,000 and 5200,000. 

Sheriff Bud Meeks, at one point, gave 
him credit for being involved in over 50 
percent of all Fort Wayne dwelling 
burglaries in recent years. 

"Terry is smart." said county 
detective Grahamn Foote. "He abhors 
violence, so he won't carry a weapon, 
and as far as 1 know, he doesn't own a 
driver's license. He'll have another kid 
drive the car, reducing his own chances 
of getting caught. 



Over the years. Foote has seen 
Terry's work repeatedly. Even with 
warrants out for Terry's arrest, Foote 
is called in to investigate break-ins he 
suspects are Terry's. 

"There was a shopping mall he broke 
into," Foote said, "He came in through 
the window of the first store, which had 
no alarm system. As in the rest of the 
stores in the mall, every inside was 
made of dry wall, so he merely kicked 
his way through to each business and 
picked the stores clean ," 

Still, Foote projects a genuine respect 
for Terry. "When he's sitting in front of 
you, he's one hell of a nice kid. You'd 
never believe he was capable of pulling 
one burglary, let alone hundreds." . 

En a video-taped confession, Terry, 
who has spent relatively little time 
behind bars, admitted to over 100 
break-ins. 

"What 1 did one time," explains 
Terry, "I got a friend of mine whose 
father was an insurance agent. With his 
old man's identification card, we went 
out to General Telephone, Without any

hassle, they installed a telephone in my 
friend's cars — convinced it was for 
business reasons, 

"We would drive in the country. 
taking peoples' names from their 
mailboxes and looking up their 
telephone numbers in a directory," said 
Terry, "From the car, my friend would 
call the residence. If no one answered, 1 
would then go up to the front door and 
pound on it. If there was still no answer. 
I'd either walk right in or go around 
back and break through a window. It 
was that easy." 

Terry seemed at ease as he continued 
to describe his methodical crimes. 

"It's never hard to break in once 
you're sure no one's around," he said, 
"It's best in the wintertime after a good 
snow. If you don't see any footprints on 
the front walk, it's a safe guess the 



tenants have gone on vacation," 

"Once I'm in the house,," he con- 
tinues, "I don't mess around; I go 
straight for the master bedroom. That's 
where the money is kept, 1 won't steal 
stereos or material goods, just cash." 

The officer conducting the interview 
asked Terry about his experiences with 
safes. "In houses and small businesses, 
they're no problem," said Terry, "Most 
weigh no more than I50pounds, so we'll 
back the car to the front door, load Ihe 
safe into the trunk, and soon thereafter, 
I'll crack il open," 

Detective Foote told how Terry had 
led officers to a river location where he 
had disposed of several safes. 

"Sometimes I'll crack it there on the 
spot," Terry continued. "It never takes 
me over 15 seconds." 

Terry also dryly stales he's never had 



any problems with guard dogs. He 
claims all they really want is to get 
outside. So if they come at him, he 
merely opens the door, brushes or kicks 
them outdoors, and closes the door 
behind them. 

It would seem Terry could justifiably 
declare himself a Picasso of burglary. 
"There aren't too many alarm systems 
I can't get through. Most of the time, I 
can get Into a house and be gone in less 
than five minutes, long before the 
police would arrive," he said. 

If something strikes his curiosity, 
Terry is not hesitant to educate himself. 
"I've spent many hours in the library 
studying alarm systems. TTiere's only 
one system I'd honestly say I'd never 
try to tackle. That's AA Zeis Silent 
Alarm, "hesaid. 

Before he attempts any job, Terry is 
reasonably sure of his success. He Irys 
to learn Ihe habits of people who live in 
the houses or the routes of patrolling 
police. He has never had anyone ac- 
cidently walk in on him during a crime. 

Even during Ihe time he was in- 



carcerated at a local correctional 
facility, Terry continued to steal. He 
was assigned to a community work 
program, 'Hell, I only worked there 
two days. After that, I went about my 
usual business. I committed more 
burglaries while I was supposedly 
locked up than when 1 was free," 
claimed Terry. 

Once again, county authorities 
vepifiedhissiory. 

Terry's home life was somewhat of 
an enigma. He disallowed his mother 
from entering his bedroom and came 
and went about his business at home 
without interference. 

He entertained his guests to beer, 
marijuana and cocaine frequently. 
Then by inlroducing new friends inio 
such luxuries, he was able to recruit 
future temporary alliances for crime. 

Why hasn't Terry spent more time in 
jail? 

"You can'l keep a kid locked rp who 
displays only perfect behavior," ex- 
plained a local correctional office.

Forget the label, but 



' This seems to be the year of "Label

On the national level, il has digressed 
, to name calling. Jimmy calls Ronnie a 
\ war mongering racist. Ronnie calls 
"Jimmy an inepi humbler. 
;' On the fourth district level, il is a little 
&gt;more subtle. 

In the forum held Monday afternoon 
^between Republican Dan Coats and - 

■Democrat John Walda, we were treated 
■to "labei politics" as its best. This is 

especially interesting since we were 

.'warned by both candidates to be on the 

'lookout (or, and to ignore, those labels. 

Coats labeled Walda a member of the 

Democratic parly, which has controlled 

Congress, blaming the ills of the last 25 

years on that party, and by inference, - 

Walda. 
Walda then labeled Coats as a member 

of the parly that wants to cut taxes, 

Readers write 



increase defense spending, and yet 
balance the budget — a dubious math- 
matical undertaking at best. 

Coals returned Ihe compliment by 
labeling Walda a member of the party 
that would give us more of the same 
economic policies. 

Walda countered with jabs at the 
Republicans, who support programs 
favoring bit oil companies. Because 
Coats is Republican, he inherils the 
label. 

The student body, who were almost 
outnumbered by the media, should get 
the "absent" label. Enough said. 

In his closing remarks, one of the 
candidates asked thai we judge this 
forum and this race, not on the basis of 
labels, but on the basis of the hard and 
fasi answers lo today's problems 
touched upon by the candidates. 

Oh, thai we could.

Have you ever dreamed of 
going to school in Montana, 
New Mexico, South Carolina, 
Wisconsin, or perhaps even 
Hawaii and not being 
charged out of stale fees? 
Your dream could come true 
through participating in Ihe 
National Student Exchange 
Program (NSE) 

Indiana University- 
Purdue University is one of 
54 member institutions in 
this program, and the only 
university in Indiana to be 
involved. 

The NSE program 
provides the opportunity for 
IPFW students lo spend a 
year of study in residence at 
a member institution during 
their sophomore -or junior 
years. 

Participating students 
remain- enrolled at IPFW 
while on exchange, and 
credil earned on exchange is 
recorded as regular degree 
credit. 

It is an ideal way for 
students to broaden cultural 
and educational horizons 
while progressing toward 
their local degree objective. 

IPFW students in Ihe 
exchange program pay their 
fees to IPFW and collect any 
financial aid to which they 
are entitled as though they 
were attending locally. This 
advantageous arrangement 
permits students lo attend 
college out of state without 
incurring additional tuition 
costs. 

Since NSE's first year of 



exchange m 1968, over 4300 
students have utilized this 
unique opportunity for a 
variety of reasons including 
exploration of new 
geographic settings, 
academic diversification, 
cultural awareness and 
search for self-identity. 

The desire to experience 
the diversity of educational 
settings, offerings and 
philosophies prompts many 
students lo utilize this option 
for sophomore or junior year 
study. 

Other students participate 
in the Exchange with the 
hope of learning more atiout 
their capabilities and 
limitations, and increasing 
an awareness of self and 
potential lo grow and mature 
both academically and 
socially. 

The National Student 
Exchange offers a new kind 
of educational opportunity 
for undergraduate students, 
based on their needs for self- 
exploration and further 
examination of twth liberal 
and professional education 
objectives. The educational 
experience should embrace 
academic, as well as social 
and cultural experiences.

Agent Orange victims covered 



Co-sponsors host workshops 



VA provides care 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

Is Agent Orange 
responsible for such illnesses 
as cancer or blood disorders 
in Viet Nam veterans? If it 
is, will relief ever come? 

According to a Veterans 
Administration news 
release, care will be 
provided for veterans. 

"No eligible veteran who is 
concerned about Agent 
Orange exposure will be 
denied Veterans 

Administration medical 
care," said Max Cleland, a 
VA administrator, while 
testifying before the Sub- 
committee on Oversight and 
Investigation of the House 
Interstate and Foreign 
Commerce Committee, 
"Unfortunately, we cannot 
provide all the answers 
today, nor will we be able to 
do so in the near future," 



said Cleland. 

CHeland also emphasized 
that medical care will not be 
delayed until the answers 
are in. 

A 1974 National Academy 
of Sciences report concluded 
there was no deTmitive 
evidence that the herbicides 
used in Viet Nam produced 
lasting damage to human 
health. 

An animal study also 
supported that Agent Orange 
exposure is not likely to 
cause fertility or other 
reproductive problems in 
males. 

The contaminant dioxin, 
which is one of the chemicals 
in Agent Orange, has been 
linked to problems in 
laboratory animals. 

Pregnant female animals 
exposed to dioxin have had a 
high rate of birth defects 



and deformed offspring. 

Humans exposed to dioxin 
during _ industrial accidaits 
have experienced 

headaches, nausea, blood 
disorders, alterations in 
liver function, nerve damage 
and a skin condition called 
chloracne. 

"These conditions ap- 
peared shortly after ex- 
posure and with the ex- 
ception of chloracne were of 
limited duration," said 
Cleland. 

"Worried About Agent 
Orange" is a VA pamphlet 
that summarizes efforts to 
deal with veterans' fears. It 
is part of a space educational 
program to update veterans 
and VA personnel. 

Agent Orange was a 
herbicide used in Viet Nam 
to kill jungle foliage to ex- 
pose Viet Cong guerrillas.

BY JEFF ELLIOTT 
The University Friends of 
Animals held its first 
meeting on Monday, October 
6, The group is headed by 
Susie Scare, a student of 
IPFW. 

"The response was just 
great," said Susie Scare. 
"It's a good feeling to see so 
many people care about 
animals," 

Concern for wildlife, farm 
animals and pets is the 
reason 18 people showed up 
for the first organizational 
meeting. The group acts 
like the right arm of the 
humane shelter in helping 



them discover cases of 
animal abuse and working to 
solve the cases. 

Kathleen Squadritc, 
Associate Professor of 
Philosophy, is the group's 
faculty advisor. 

Scare says the 
organization will be working 
with the humane shelter as it 
tries to collect $10,000 for 
books to educate the children 
of the Fort Wayne Com- 
munity Schools. The money 
that was needed for these 
tiooks was appropriated to 
the shelter under the 
Armstrong administration, 
but taken away when the 



In the weeks ahead, the 
group plans to look at the 
cages where the ex- 
perimental animals are 
stored on campus. There are 
rumors that the animals are 
being kept inhumanely. 
There is also opposition to 
the fact that many of the 
experiments are not needed 
and should not have to be 
done every year. 

The group's next meeting 
will be on October 20, at noon 
in room 224 of the Walb 
Memorial Union.

'Butler' shows potential 



By STEVE RIEGEL 

In a hard (ought political 
year like this one, nolhing 
could be more appropriate 
than Arena Thealre's 
revival of "Of Thee I Sing," 
This 1932 musical pokes 
enough holes in the 
American polLcical system 
to let all Ihe hoi air come 
bursting oul In fits of 
laughter. 

The show is the story of 
John P. Wintergreen, who 
runs (or President on a 
platform of "love" because 
il will altrael t|ie greatest 
possible number of voters 
without getling him in 
trouble. Nevertheless, like 
most polilicians, he gets into 
trouble and must resort to a 
series of comic dodges in 
order lo preserve a 
respectable public opinion. 

The Arena production, 
directed by Larry Wardlaw. 
makes the most of this 
Pulilizer Prize winning 
show, which features a score 
by the man who practically 
invenlcd musical comedy as 
we know il, George Gersh- 
win. 

The large cast, headed by 
Denny Bechtelheimer as 



By STEVE RIEGEL 
PIT'S production of "What 
the Butler Saw" is a show for 
the incurably insane. This 
madcap comedy is totally 
absurd from start lo finish. 



Everything about the show 
reflects a wacky air of 
madness, disorder, and 
perversion. It lampoons 
itself in a zany collection of 
farce, including misguided 



Winlergreen and Janet 
Piercy as Mary Turner, 
sings end dances through the 
election in a way that makes 
politics fun. Bechtelheimer 
and Piercy sing so well 
together thai it probably 
jusliries the inclusion of 
extra Gershwin songs to 
show off their voices. 

Outstanding performances 
are also given by Judi 
Hoagland as the jilted Diana 
Devereaux and George 
Koegel as the French 
Ambassador Becio' Niccum 
adds a cute louch as Ihe 
maid. 

The action In Ihe show is 
well-limed and hilariously 
funny. The salire (lows so 
smoolhly that its jabs are 
effeclive, but painless. Only 
upon looking back does it 
become apparent that the 
love party is just as corrupt 
as everyone else's. 

"Of Thee I Sing" is a good 
tonic for those who take the 
political game loo seriously, 
as well as those who 
recognize it tor what it is. Al 
a time when Ihere seems lo 
be no choice for Ihe voting 
public. Arena and Win- 
tergreen offer a suitable 
alternative.

Philharmonic 
lishes music 



poli 



By MICHELE De VINNEY 

The Fort Wayne 
Philharmonic, directed by 
Ronald Ondrejka. opened its 
37lh season with a highly 
professional and polished 
performance at the 
Emt&gt;assy Theatre Saturday 
night. 

The audience was large 
and comprised mostly of 
older patrons adorned in 
minks and jewels. 

The show opened with '"Le 
Corsaire' Overture, Op. 21" 
by Hector Berloiz. The or- 
chestra handled the piece 
beautifully, giving the music 
an almost lilting quality until 
the exciting and powerful 
finish. 

Paul Schenly. the guest 
pianist, then look Ihe stage to 
join the orchestra in Saint- 
Saens' "Concerlo No, 2 in G 
Minor for Piano and 
Orchestra, Op. 22," 

Schenly 's performance 
was masterful. His skilled 
command of the keyboard 
gave the music an over- 



whelming vitality, and the 
effect was breathtaking. 

The orchestra did a fine 
job of accompanying him, 
playing some well-timed 
phrases that p^^fectly 
enhanced the piano lines. 

The audience was ap- 
preciative of Schenly's 
talent, with many listeners 
standing in the most en- 
thusiastic ovation of the 
evening, 

Foftowing a brief 
lermission, Ihe show con- 
cluded with Brahms' 
"Symphony No, l in C Minor 
Op. 68." Again the per- 
formance was good and the 
musicianship superb. 

If there was a flaw, it was 
in the programming. By 
showcasing Schenly before 
the intermission, Ihe evening 
peaked too soon and despite 
the quality of Ihe finale, il 
proved to be anti-climatic. 
The audience grew restless, 
with some actually nodding 
off in the seals. Brahms 
deserves better. 




seductions, mistaken 
identities, and mixed-up 
motives, that blasts nearly 
every convention of modern 
society, a la Monty Pylhon. 

However, not all of Ihe 
show equals the potential for 
comedy inherent in Joe 
Orion's script. Director 
Maureen O'Reilly has 
evidently paid careful at- 
tention to the nuances in the 
action, but the forced pace 
and stiff acting drain energy 
from the production, 
especially in Ihe first act. It 
seems to take everyone a 
while lo relax enough to get 
into the spirit of lunacy. 

The best acting comes 
from Dan Harlh and Jack 
Spring as the two 
psychiatrists. Ranee and 
Prentice. Harth, in par- 
ticular, effects a real flair 
for derangement, Jeanne 
Hoffama also compliments 
the action as Prentice's 
nymphomanicwife, 

Darrell Hankey camps his 
portrayal of the op- 
porlunisCic bellhop, but 
Nancy Andria seems 
somewhat tentative in her 
role as the victimized 
secretary. Both seem to 



improve as they \ 
Carl Sargent's policeman is 
played too straight lo realize 
much of the character's 
buffoonery, however. 

One of the most effective 
elements of the show is the 
set design by Sluart Sweet, 
The Sunny Sylvan 
Sanitarium is the perfect 
setting for bedlam. The only 
square corner in it is in the 
file cabinet, which turns out 
lo he a bar, and the walls are 
a pink that would drive 
anyone crazy. 

There are plenty of doors 
for the characters to duck 
through when the comic 
action picks up. One of the 
funniest things in Ihe show is 
Ihe train of idiots thai passes 
by the garden door. 

"What The Butler Saw" 
has the potential lo be a very 
funny show if the cast can 
develop a feeling for its 
bizarre humor. In its current 
stale, however, it relies lo 
heavily on Ihe ability of the 
audience lo preceive its 
subtle elements. Assuming 
that it will improve as the 
run continues, Ihe show 
could turn out to be quite 
entertaining, especially for 
those who are nuts.

of money. The Brothers

in their divine wisdom. 
decreed that another film be 
made- And Lo, another film 
was made wilh the catchy 
titteof "Oh.Godl-Bookll." 

The Brothers Warner

The film makes you 
wonder why they bothered

replay of Ihe original, wilh 
God enlisting Ihe help of a 
lillle girl instead of a grown- 
up 1(1 spread his message. 

The original worked 
because there was some grit 
lo il, Direclor Carl Reiner 
realized thai "Oh. God'* 



needed a serious, reverent 
tone for the light moments lo 
work. 

The sequel fails because 
director Gilbert Gates has 
given in to Ihe temptation lo 
playit "culesy." 

Gates gels completely 
side-tracked by a stupid 
subplot involving the girl 
proving whether or nol she's 
sane because she has seen 
God. In fact. Gates' devotion 
is this aspect of the film 
leaves little lime for Burns, 
Burns appears in only five 
scenes, less screen lime Ihan 
he had in the original. The 
film would have been better 
if Gales gave more lime lo 
Burns and Ihe girl 

Once again, George Burns 
does a good job as God 
Burns' is Ihe only thing Ihal 
saves the film from being 
totally boring. He shows 
God's humanity, and has 
great pace and timing. 
However, he is hampered by 
Ihe rollen script. Louannc. 
as Tracy, ihe girl, does a 
good Job. even if she borders 
on the cjoyingly cule She 
and Burns have a nice 



chemistry that makes their 
scenes work. 
The script is credited lo 

five writers, and it is obvious 
thai the humor got lost 
through all the rewrites. 
"Book 11" simply isn't as 
funny or as charming as the 
first one. It produces a few 
smiles, but no guffaws like 
the original did. The script is 
lame, and not even Burns'

As of the end of Sep- 
tember. Artlink Artspace, 
located at I126 Broadway, 
began its third year of 
operations and is going and 
growing stronger than ever, 
according lo Mike Ellis, 
executive director. 

Artlink Gallery, a non- 
profit organization, offers a 
varied flow of artistic 
exhibits and talents such as 
photography, music, dance, 
poetry, theater and visual 
arts, all directed at those 
people who really appreciate 
these aesthetic forms. 

Simply put, Artlink is an 
arlspace for artists thai 
couldn't be in a belter sel- 
ling. The building, al first a 
bakery and later a school of 
Ju-Jitsu, has so much 
character and personality il 
seems as though it were built 
with its present purpose in 
mind. 

The quality of exhibits and 
talent of artists exhibiting 
and performing is extremely 
high. Nowhere else in this 
region are you going lo find 
such remarkably high 
standards for value and 
taste in art. The gallery was 
not created oul of want, but 
oul of need ; that need came 
from Ihe local artists 
themselves, 

TTiis type of arlspace is 
unique in Fori Wayne. lis 
main purpose is to provide a 
place for local artists lo 
exhibit Iheir talents for the 
interested public and other 



artists to enjoy, learn from 
and appreciate. Other places 
display arlislic creations, 
bul for different reasons and 
motives. For example. The 
Fort Wayne Museum of Art 
specializes in bringing 
outside works into the city, 
and some local galleries 
exhibit mainly to collect 
sales commissions, 

"We're still going strong 
and the future looks good," 
said Ellis, who has been with 
Artlink from the beginning. 
Presently, they are ex- 
panding wilh a sales gallery 
next door and a print shop 
behind that, TTiey are also 
remodeling the upstairs into 
classrooms for the Fori 
Waynce Dance Colleclive 
and Poetry 1, and are 
planning to install and 
remodel the downstairs 
gallery wilh acoustic 
paneling. 

The new sales gallery 
opened this past summer 
and is doing quite well, Ellis 
confirmed. The print shop, a 
pari of Artlink, has separate 
books and records to keep 
the gallery and shop apart. 

One of the lastest ventures 
is the monthly "Artlink P- 
review" Journal, which is a 
successful major project. 
Also scheduled to be shown 
in 1981 on cable TV. is a 
series of six programs en- 
lilled "An Evening At 
Arllink." Ellis feels thai tha 
media series and the 
"Arllink P-review" are very 
important events for Ihe

Also included in Ihe new

atomic bomb has affected 
our lives. The scries, entitled 
"Shadows of the Nuclear 
Age, ' will be broadcast each 
Thursday al 7 1«pm

spotlighted this fall on 
Salurday mornings at II

music recorded by Tyler 
across the slate of Indiana.

Wayne's Latino community, 
entitled "L^lln American

and information about the 
latino people This program 
is oroduced at KUT-TV in 



Austin. Texas, 

The station's fund-raising 
efforts are the main reason 
for much of WIPUs special 
programming during 
Oclober, said George Wendt, 
the stalion manager of 
WIPU, 

Ttie money generated by 
Ihe fund-raising will be used 
lo supplement Ihe general 
operating budget, and for the 
purchase of special records 
and new equipment lor the 
station 



gallery that should lead lo a 
good increase in public in- 
terest and provide a bright 
future for the organization. 

As compared to similar 
federal and state funded 
( National Endowment for 
Ihe Arts and Indiana Arts 
Commission, respeclively.) 
arls organizations, "Artlink 
is as stable as and has more 
to offer than Ihe best of 
them," Ellis stated proudly. 
A change Ellis would like 
lo see in the future is less 
blues (such as Venessa 
Davis) which are of ex- 
cellent quality and very 
popular al Arllink. His 
complaint is that common 
crowds of 350 are almost loo 
much for Artlink lo handle, 
since Ihe concerts frequently 
turn into big parties. He 
feels this may affect the 
good reputation and 
"mellowness" usually 
associated with the gallery. 
Arllink really isn't in the 
entertainment and 

promotional business. 

The quality of exhibits is 
due lo the selective 
screening of artists proposal 
forms, which are either 
accepted or rejected by the 
Artist Panel. The panel, 
chaired by a program 
director, consists of nine 
practicing artists elected for 
one-year terms and 
representing photography, 
visual arts, poetry, dance, 
music and theater. 

As executive director, 
Ellis' job entails staff. 
building and progress 
development, along wilh 
finance and tax respon- 
sibilities. It is not un- 
common, however, to see 
him grab nails and a ham- 
mer, or do whatever else 
seems to need lo be done. 

Fori Wayne needs Arllink, 
Anyone who is Into arl and

Loggins hits the top 



BYGRETCHEN 

HOLODICK 

It's been a long lime since 
Kenny Loggins wrote songs 
for The Nilly Gritty Dirl 
Band. II has also t&gt;cen a long 
way to the top for him, but I 
think he's finally made il 
with his successrul theme 
song "I'm Alright," from 
"CaddyShack." climbing the 
charts and a new double live 
album called "Kenny 
Loggins, Live." 

Loggins began his career 
in the lale sixties with The 
DIrl Band, and eventually 
became a part, (hanks to 
Columbia records A&amp;R man 
Don Ellis, of a duo entitled 
Loggins and Messina. The 



duo Gxislcd Tor about six 
years, and in this lime some 
good albums were produced. 
One of these, "Kenny 
Uggins With Jim Messina 
Sittin" In" was so called 
because Kenny did most of 
the work. 

When Loggins finally 
broke away from the duo in 
1976, he launched into a solo 
career. Some popular songs 
during his solo career in- 
cluded "When Ever I Call 
You Friend." written with 
Melissa Manchester, -from 

1978. and "This Is It," In 

1979. Both selections did well 
onlhecharts.

Alright," may do Just as

fact that Loggins Isn't a

write love songs. He can put 
a lot of feeling into a song 
and In turn, crank out with 
the best 

Tlie quality of music on 
"Kenny Loggins, Live" is 
unbelievable. There is a 
wide range of songs to please 
everyone's taste. 

Loggins can go from 
completely electric tracks to 
a totally acoustic sound, 
from one cut lo Ihe next. 
Also, Ihe sound on this LP is 
particularly good and 
without a lot of distortion. 
The album is easy on the 
ears, but satisfying to the 
mind. 

Some of the best tracks on 
the Album are "I'm 
Alright, " "You Don't Know 
Me." a beautifully composed 
song, and "Celebrate Me 
Home." The latter involves 
quite a bit of audience 
participation, and Loggins 
really puts his heart into it. 
Side three is a fairly 
mellow side with some 
love songs and side four, in 
quite a contrast, is very 
eccentric. 

"Kenny Loggins, Live" is 
a quality album that would 
be an asset lo anyone's 
record collection.

One of Ihe biggest assets of 
Fori Wayne is the Cinema 
Center The Cinema Center 
provides Fort Wayne 
filmgoers with the chance lo 
see films Ihal wouldn't or- 
dinarily playhere 

The center was introduced 
in 1976, after a small Iheatre 
called the Spectator closed. 
The Spectator's fare con- 
sisted of foreign films and 
old American classics, 

"We wanted to fill the void 
the Spectator left," Laura 
Pipino, one of the founding 
members of the Cinema 
Center, said. "We were 
concerned that there 
wouldn't be a place lo see the 
type of films the Spectator 
offered." 

L.ess than six months after 
the Spectator closed, Ihe 
Cinema Center presented its 
first series of films al what 
was (hen known as the Arts 
School on West Berry. 

"One of the reasons we got 
together was simply for 
comaraderte," Sail Secaur, 
president of the Cinema 
Center, said. "We just fell 
there should be a place for 
people lo go to talk about 
films and meet other people 
who share an interest in 
films. " 

Secaur stated that she 
would also like lo see the 
Cinema Center be of help lo 
people who want to make 
films She said that one of the 
goals of the Center in the 
future is to provide a library 
of information for film- 
makers. 

In just four years, the 
Cinema Center has grown 
and this year marks not only 
the Center's move lo a 
permanent home, the main 
library on Wetjsler Street, 
but also the strongest line-up 
of films lo date. 

Their next film, Luchino 
Visconti's "Death In 
Venice," is considered lo be 
one of his best. The film is a 
character study of an artist 
and his constant search for 
beauty. 
Based on a Shirley 



Jackson novel. Robert 
Wise's "The Haunting" is 
one of the best spooky, 
creaking old house thrillers. 
Good performances by Julie 
Harris and Claire Bloom are 
seen. 

Edouard Molinaro's "La 
Cage Aux Folles," has 
broken all txix office records 
for foreign films in New 
York and is the biggest 
grossing foreign film lo date. 
Howard Hawks' "Twen- 
tieth Century" comes next. 
Hawks was founder of the 
genre of films Ihat has come 
lo be known as screwball 
comedy. Hawks' flair for 
timing and fast-paced 
dialogue is apparent in this 
tale of Ihe conflicts between 
a Broadway producer and 
his star. 

Jean Cocteau's "Beauty 
and the Beast" is an ex- 
cellent and striking variation 
of thefairytale. 

Woody Allen's backhanded 
tribute lo science fiction 
films, "Sleeper," is an 
unique brandof comedy that 
makes this film one of the 
funniest ever made. 

Bruno Bozzeteto's 
"Allegro Non Troppo" is the 
Italian answer to Disney's 
"Fantasia." It contains 
many unusual animated and 
musical sequences. 

Rainer Werner Fass- 
binder's "Despair" is an 
adaptation of the Vladimer 
Natiokov novel. The film was 
wrillen by British 
playwright Tom Stoppard 
and marks the firsi time a 
Fassbinder film has been 
seen in Fort Wayne. 
Fassbinder is considered by 
many critics as the fmest of 
the new German directors. 

George Stevens' 

"Swingtime" is a fine Fred 
Astaire-Ginger Rogers 
musical that has some fine 
Jerome Kern songs and, as 
befits a Rogers-Astaire 
team-up. good dancing. 

Closing out the season is 
Ingmar Bergman's "Magic 
Flute," The film is an en- 
joyable adaptation of Mo- 
zart's opera.

Her first impressions of 
Fort Wayne were the "big, 
big airport, yellow cabs, 
cornfields, different people, 
awful weather-90-degree 
heal and high humidity-no 
rice to eat, all corn and 
potatoes— you can't have 
minute rice. It's not the 
same — foods are altogether 
different." 

"I've learned so much 
since I've been here," 



Cynthia said. "You can't put 
a price on knowledge " She 
then told about how she 
learned of a difference 
between customs: "I got 
laughed at when I went up to 
Ann's room because I look 
off my shoes before stepping 
on her carpet ," she said.

"When he was at out place, 
you couldn't ask for a better 
resident." 

Foote felt Terry was able 
to adjust lo whatever roles 
the environment called for. 

Lynda Graham, an Allen 
County probation officer and 
field supervisor, observed: 
"He's a likable kid. When 
you see all (he hardcores 
that come (brought the 
system, you almost feel 
sorry for him." 

Terry also suggested ways 
of preventing crime. "When 
I was younger, I'd be 
walking down the road with 
my pockets bulging with 
stolen merchandise. More 
(han once a policeman would 
pass me and not stop. I think 
if he would have only stop- 
ped, I would have confessed 
everything, 

"Most kids don"t walk 
down country roads alone in 
the middle of the night 
without having just done 
something wrong," says 
Terry, 

Foote expanded on Terry's 
abilities. "I really believe he 
could get himself a job with 
an insurance company as a 
crime prevention consultant 
and make good money at it. 



But it's not only (he money. 
Terry geuinely loves a 
challenge," 

As Terry grows older, his 
yearning for larger hauls 
increases. After one arrest, 
he was found to have 511,000 
in cash on his person. 
Currently, there is a warrant 
for his arest involving a 
$29,000 heist. Another crime 
he is credited for is the iheft 
of a 520,000 coin collection, 

Foote explains the new 
dilemma that comes with 
Terry's increasing age. 

"The kid has just turned 
18. That means he'll no 
longer be treated as a 
juvenile. And the last time I 
talked to (he prosecutor, he 
informed me that his office is 
going to try to get Terry put 
awayfor 20 years." 

Sighing, the delective 
glances at a picture on the 
wall, "1 know Terry and 1 
know the prison system in 
this country. Believe me, 
Terry will be one of those 
who won't be able (o make 
(he grade in the joint. It's not 
like life on the streets."

tight-knit group, said, "We 
''all like it here. We're just 
homesick," Patty "Pat Rat" 
Sweeney, from Governor. 
New York, said, "I think it 
would have been hard to 
socially adjust without the 
other NSE studentshere. 

The group was unanimous 
in the opinion that NSE 
coordinator Donna Worthley 
and the Rev. Joe Watkins 
had been super in helping 
them to adjust. 

Jane "Hawk" Gooding 
from Crofton, Maryland, 
who had threatened lo go 
home for two weeks, said she 
didn't know how much she 
liked it here until she went 
home for a short visit and 
could talk of nothing but 
Indiana. 

Leslie, Jane and Carmel 
said that the guys here are 
much more conservative 
than the guys back home. In 
an exaggeration, Patty said, 
"I've been studying so hard, 
I haven't had time to find 
out," Cynthia said, "The 
guys back home are more 
conservative or shy. They 
have to be very sure you are 
interested in (hem before 
they will talk to you," She 
added that many people here 
think she is foreign and can't 
speak English, so few people 
talk to her first, 

Carmel said, "We've met a 
lot of people because we're 
outgoing, but not that many 
guys have approached us 
first." She and the others 
think the reason for this is 
(he conservadve nature of 
the midwest, 

Douglas describes the 
dating here as much more 
formal— the guys are sup- 
posed to take the initiative 
by asking the girl out and 
pay for the date while the 
girl plays coy, whereas in 
New Mexico, the girl will 
come up and say, "Hey, 



would you like to go out?" 

Jane and Carmel are from 
the same campus ' where, 
they said, the girls do the 
same, Jane exemplified this 
attitude about dating best 
when she said, "If you want, 
you take," 

On Leslie's campus, she 
said, a group of girls who are 
going somewhere ask a 
group of guys if they want to 
come along, but one girl 
doesn't very often ask one 
guy out for a date. 

The NSE program is lor 
sophomores and juniors: 
Leslie's case is an exception. 
She is a senior and one of the 
few students on her campus 
is allowed to exchange. 
Leslie is working as a 



research assistant for the 
psychology department, and 
with Ihe 19 credit hours she is 
taking this semester, she will 
be able lo graduate from 
North Carolina State 
University in May. 

Patty's reason for 
exchanging was "to broaden 
my horizons," she said. 
IPFW has a good computer 
department where she could 
take computer hardware 
(electronic) courses that arc 
not offered on her campus. 
She advises anyone who does 
exchange to take as few 
credit hours as possible and 
preferably outside their 
major so Ihat they will have 
time to explore the place to 



which 'hey exchange. Patty 
has also started a small 
business; she sells munchies 
lo the junk food junkies in 
her dorm. 

Last week. Chancellor 
Joseph Giusli held an in- 
formal luncheon for the NSE 
students in the Walb 
Memorial Union, Carmel, 
speaking for the grouo, said 
that it was nice lhat the 
(Chancellor knew who they 
are and thai it was an honor 
to meet him and Bette 
Worley, who is the head of 
the national NSE program.

'Beginning to flow' 

Spikers defeat 



4 of 5 



By GARY 
BAUMGARTNER 

The women 's volleyball 
learn had Iheir mosl suc- 
cessful week of Ihe season 
lasl week, winning four oul 
of five malches. Now, 
halfway through the season, 
the Tuskers mark stands at 
6-10, 

Coach Peggy Voisin feels 
her team is just "...begining 
to flow " With only two 
starters back from lost 
year's state champion team, 
the spikers have been trying 
to adjust to each other 
during the most difncult 
portion of their schedule, 
"They're (beginning to know 
each other," Voisin said. 
'"They know how each other 
plays. It one girl can't get the 
ball, another will, rather 
than just let it go." 

"Teamwork Is the name of 
Ihe game in volleyball," 
Voisin said, "One player 
can't do It all for you. Our 
girls are putting it together 
now. and it showed last 
week." 

The Tuskers started this 
rampage with the Falcons 
from Bible College, Playing 



on their home court at 
Concordia gym. the IPFW 
squad defeated their guests 
1^-9, lS-I2and 16-14 to win the 
three out of five contest. 

On Thursday, Iho spikers 
traveled to Indianapolis to 
duel lUPUI in Vincennes. 
Both schools are AIAW 
(Association of Inter- 
collegiate Athletics for 
Women) Division II. 

The Tuskers rDlvision ID 
upended Vincennes in the 
first match 15-12 and 15-12, 
but Ihen suffered their only 
loss of the week by falling to 
lUPUI, 15-12. 7-15and9-15, 

Saturday found the 
women's team on the road 
again, this time to Man- 
chester to play Bclhel and 
Manchester Colleges. Both 
schools are Division III. and 
gave the Tuskers an op- 
portunity to show their stuff 
against 'equal' competition. 

The spikers disposed of 
both foes in easy fashion. 
First, they took Bethel In 
three games, 5-15, 15-13 and 
15-6. Then the Tuskers 
dropped their hosts, the 
Manchester Spartans, again 
in three games, l5-a, 1315 




and 15-9. 

Voisin is optimistic that 
her team will continue to 
play well. She feels the 
hardest part of the season is 
behind them, as they will 
now play more Division 111 
team.s with Ihe remainder of 
the schedule. 

Also. Ihe team is healthier. 
"Injury-wise. we are 
beginning to heal," Voisin 
said. Both Nancy Rorick and 
Kim Heimann are back in 
the line-up after being 
sidelined with injuries, 
Rorick wears a brace on her 
dislocated finer while 
playing. "Her finger is 
healing welt and the brace is 
not bothering her," Voisin 
said. 

The only Tusker still not 
able to compete due to injury 
is Sue Hendricks. Hendricks 
suffered an upper thigh 
muscle pull and is still 
recovering, 

Voisin is looking forward 
to Ihe stale tourney. "We 
play Division 1 and 11 teams 
(during the season) to im- 
prove. But in the playoffs, we 
go against only Division II 
teams, so I think we can do 
very well," 

The Tuskers already know 
Ihey will meet St. Mary's 
and Anderson in pool play of 
Ihe playoffs. The state 



tourney playoffs begin on 
November 13-15, 

On Tuesday, Ihe spikers 
were to have hosted 
Valparaiso at Ihe Concordia 
gym This afternoon, they 



travel to Goshwi lo play St. 
Joseph's, Indiana Tech and 
Goshen. Saturday, the 
women's volleyball team 
will meet Huntington and St. 
Joseph's, again at Ren- 
■;elear.

Rain or shine 



BV JIM CHAPMAN 
The IPFW men's soccer 

team's chances of qualifying 
for the NCAA Division III 
playoffs grew very slim as 
the Tuskers were shut oul 
twice last week. IPFW 
suffered at the hands of St. 
Francis by the score of S-0 
andGraceby the scored 1-0, 

Against the Cougars, who 
were ranked I8lh in NAIA 
competition, the Tuskers 
played a decent first half but 
losl control in the second 
half. 

"We played terrible. They 
really dominated," com- 
mented Coach Ed 
Stofankiewicz atiout his 
team's second-half play, 

St Francis led 1-0 afterthe 
Tirst half because of a freak 
play in which a Tusker 



player failed to sigrlal that 
Ihe ball was out of play. 
Instead, he kicked the ball in 
bounds near the Tusker goal 
and St, Francis capitalized 



"We 



dis- 



very 
appointed, " said 

Stefankiewicz. 

Grace College scored on a 
headball from a comer kick, 
and that was all they needed 
as the Tuskers were defeated 
for the third time this season 
by thescoreof 1-0. 

The Tusker defense 
executed their well-done 
first-half job against a 
steady wind. Ironically, the 
Grace team scored the only 
goal against the wind in the 
second half 

IPFW blew their chances 
when Ihey failed to convert 



on two restart-indirect kicks 
from four and seven yards 
oul. 

IPFW is now 5-5 on the 
year with six games 
remaining to be played. The 
Tuskers have never gone on 
to play in any post-season 
games. 

"We waot to straighten 
durselves oul SO that we can 
have a winning season." said 
Stefankiewicz. 

The Coach praised his 
team's defense but com- 
mented that the offense will 
have lo convert more op- 
portunities into goals. "We 
need an entire team effort," 
he said. 

IPFW hosts Findlay at 
home this afternoon at 4:00 
p.m. and travels to Marion 
on Saturday.
