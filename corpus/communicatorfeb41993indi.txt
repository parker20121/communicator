No IPFW-sponsorcd childcarc is 
available for siudenis or faculiy this 
scmesier. Siudcnl govcmmcni and ihc 
Cliildcare Task Force mci scparaicly 
on Monday hoping to alleviate ihai 
problem by ncjtl fall. 

The Educaic Childcajc Consonium 
ai Parkview Hospital, where IPFW 
pulled out last semester, has extended 
privileges lo stranded IPFW parents 
ai S3 per hour per child. 

Rajai Suri, president of IPSGA, said 
that some parcnis want iPFW to rc- 
lum to [he Consortium. 
, "Reluming to the Educare Consor- 
tium is just not going lo happen," said 
Suri. 

One unhappy IPPA' studcnt-parcm 
lold The Communicator, "I have lo 
use Parkview's facility until 1 can find 
a good part-time baby-siitcr. even 
though it's expensive." 

Sccmab Rashccd. IPSGA vice-pres- 
ident of rinant:c, remembers that a lot 
of angry parcnis called him last se- 
mester after txing notified by the uni- 
versity thai the Educare Consortium 
would soon be hisiory. He thinlcs that 
withdrawal from the Consortium 



could have been due to financial and 
political motivations, but is not sure. 

"Who or where it screwed up. we 
don't know," said Rashccd, '"We arc 
concerned where our S 27 .000 went." 

"Siudcnl government earmarked 
S27,(XX) or appro*imaiely 10 percent 
of the student services fees for child- 
care for ihc 1992-93 school year. 
Parkview recently returned 513,000 
for spring scmesier 1993. 

Suri strongly recommends thai the 
SI3.000 reccnUy returned by die Edu- 
care Consonium be frozen in an ac- 
count and used next fall when some 
kind of childcarc will again be avail- 
able to students. 

The Childcarc TSsk Force mci on 
Monday. Feb. I and includes Frank L. 
Borelli, vice-chancellor for student 
affairs, Marian K. Zimmerman, dean 
of Students. Pearl M. Heath, visiting 
assistant professor in education and 
Educare user, Philip C. Davich. busi- 
ness administrator, and Kimbcrly S.

Neither student government repre-

During January, the Task Force pre- 
pared a survey for IPFW parents. On- 
ly 100 yellow forms were returned 
The committee believes that noi 
enough students have seen the three - 
page survey in Hclmke Library. K ei- 
der Hall's Information Office, or Ca- 
reer Services. 

Qoyd, when reached by phone, said 
ihai she didn't think die survey could 
assess the real issues of need. She be- 
lieves a stopgap solution was belter 
ihan another whole year without 
childcarc on campus. 

'The time frame (for the Childcarc 
Task Force) was governed by bud- 
getary submission guidelines," said 
Cloyd. "There really was no way to 
do a thorough and adequate study of 
childcare by March l." 

"We would like lo have at least two 
hundred smdenis respond to the sur- 
vey," said Zinuncrman. "That would 
give us a good sampling." 

The Task Force has extended the 
due dale for returning the forms and 
hopes to hear from more parents. The 
committee will make a recommenda- 
tion by March I, after two more Mon- 
day afternoon meetings on Feb. 8 and 
22. 




Sexual harassment 

Women, men victimized 



Financial aid eligibility changes 



Tlie latest congressional re-autho- 
rization process for financial aid has 
resulted in major changes starting 
with the 1993^4 school year. 

Acconiing to Gina M. Roberts, Di- 
rector of the Financial Aid Office 
(FAO). the majority of these 
changes will be positive. 

Because the federal government 
decided to make the changes cffcc- 
live immediately, the FAO had litUc 
lime to prepare. 

This year, the timing of the com- 
plete financial aid process is off due 
10 the congressional changes. Nor- 
mally ready by December 15. fomis 
arc just now available. 

"Moving that application process a 
month and a half behind schedule 
shows you that it's going to snow- 
ball through the whole process for 
the 93/94 school year." Roberts stat- 
ed. "The reason again is because the 
forms were not distributed on time 
because the processors had to 
change the form," 

The free form, one of the positive 
changes for siudcnis, is now called 
the FAFSA or Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid. Students no 
longer pay processing fees for feder- 
al. Slate, or IPFNV need-based finan- 
cial aid. 

Approximately 35 quesiions were 
eliminated from die FAFSA such as 
expected yearly income and dollar 
value quesiions. 

Congress has eliminated a few of 
the critical questions, so students 
must also fill out the [PFW Supple- 
mental Form. This form is enclosed 
within the FAFSA, giving the stu- 
dent everything needed to apply for 
financial aid. 

The FAFSA is sent to the process- 
ing center in Iowa City, Iowa, while 
the supplemental form should be re- 
lumed to ihe FAO by the priority 
deadline of March 1. 

The FAFSA pnority deadline is set 
so students may qualify for state aid 
and for some types of IPFW admin- 
istered aid. Students not meeting the 
priority deadline forfeit eligibility 
for state funding, and possibly for- 
feit eligibility for IPFW funding, but 
they can still qualify for federal fi- 
nancial aid. 

The deadline for federal financial 
aid is May 2. 1994. for the 1993/94 
school year. The federal loan pro- 
gram and the federal Pell Grant pro- 
gram arc not affected by the priority 
deadline. 

An example of the funding that 
IPFW administers is the federal 
Supplemental Educational Oppomi- 
nily Grant (SEOG). The priority 
deadline is used as a guide for ad- 
ministering these monies. If a stu- 
dent doesn't meet die deadline and 
funds arc left, then the FAO makes 
thai funding available to the apply- 
ing student. 

Also available is the university 
grant program. IPFW funds some 




grants completely through the 
school for the students who demon- 
strate need. 

Other changes affecting the stu- 
dents include the Federal Stafford 
Loan Program, This major loan pro- 
gram, through die federal govcm- 
mcni, has changed a great deal. Cur- 
rently, a student must be able to 
demonsn-aic need by filing the finan- 
cial aid forms. 

Beginning with the 1993/94 school 
year, the Stafford Loan program will 
be available to all siudents, regard- 
less of need. 

The student must, however, file the 
FaFSA form and meet other guide- 
lines, such as academic progress cri- 
teria, and be enrolled in the correct 
number of credit hours. 

There is a difference for the stu- 
dent with and without financial 
need. The siudcnl who borrows 
showing need has inicresi payments 
subsidized by the federal govern- 
ment. A student who borrows with- 
oui need is responsible for making 
interest payments while in school. 

IPFW recommends the siudent, if 
at all possible, make interest pay- 
ments while in school, as die inter- 
est will compound with the princi- 
pal, causing the student to pay back 
more when the student stops attend- 
ing school. 

The Stafford Lomi limits will be 
higher for almost all students starl- 
ing with the 1993/94 school year, A 
first year student may still borrow 
S2,625, which is unchanged from 
the previous year, a second year stu- 
deni may now borrow up to S3,500 
per year, and a third or fourth year 
student may now borrow up to 
55,500 per year, bringing the allow- 
able aggregate borrowing for an un- 
dersiaduate student up to S23.00O, 

"We caution students to be conser- 
vative in what they bonow under 
the loan programs," Roberts cau- 
tioned, "because it adds up. When 
you're finished with your four or 
five years, or however long it lakes, 
few of us wani to face our new jobs 
wiihaS23.000debi." 

Robens pointed out the shift from 
the grams to the loans over the last 
ten years, and acknowledged that 



loans arc one of die few options for 
some students. 

Another major negative change for 
students, according to Roberts, is 
the reduction of the Pell Grant from 
S2,400 lo S2,300. This is the first 
lime in ten years that die grant has 
not stayed the same or increased. 
The gap will be made up in in- 
creased loans since there are no new 
grant fundings. The shifting trend 
has been from grants to loans over 
the last ten years. 

All of these changes were made 
during the Reagan and Bush admin- 
istrations. There is no knowledge of 
what will happen now thai Clinton 
is in office. Robens thought. 

"We anticipate that there will be 
some technical amendments tnade to 
some of the changes that may adjust 
some of these things slightly," 
Roberts explained. "As far as the 
Pell Grant maximum, thai, most 
likely, will not change because the 
Pell Grant has already gone dirough 
the budgeting process." 

The last major change involves the 
dependent student status, which af- 
fects students under die age of 24, 
Section B of the FAFSA asks six 
questions. A siudent who doesn't 
meet one of these six criteria is not 
considered dependent by the new 
federal standards: over 24. bom be- 
fore January 1, 1970: a veteran of 
the US Armed Forces; a graduate 
student obtaining a post- baccalaure- 
ate degree; manied; a ward of the 
court and/or orphan: or with legal 
dependents other than a spouse. 
There are ways to appeal, which 
will be dealt with on a case by case 
basis. 

The Federal financial aid process 
could lake as long as ten to twelve 
weeks, resulting in the FAO process 
also being delayed. Siudents who do 
not wish to apply for financial aid 
may view the scholarship book at 
the FAO window. There are a vari- 
ety of scholarships widi different re- 
quirements.

What Is "Sexual Harassment"? 

According to the amended Title VII of die Civil Rights Act of 1965. 

"unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors, and other verbal 

or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: 

1. Submission lo such conduct is made either expliciUy or implicitly a 
term or condidon of an individual's employment: 

2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as 
die basis for employment decisions affecting such individual: or 

3. Such conduct has die purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering 
with an individual's work performance or aeaung an intiraidaiing, hos- 
lilc, or offensive working environment." (from "Preventing Sexual Ha-

A proposed project should focus on 
one specific issue, such as literacy, 
AIDS or die enviiormenL It may be a 
creative initiative or in conjunction 
with an already existing program. 



such as Head Stan, Habitat for Hu- 
manity or Great Hunger Cean-Up. 

The recipients of die mini-grants are 
expected to worit to increase the num- 
ber of people involved in community 
service and to uphold high standards 
in quality programming. They will al- 
so attend a training program in Octo- 
ber as well as an end-of-ycar evalua- 
tion meeung. In addiuon the recipient 
will submit quarterly updates.

Seek help if harassed 



While the publicity of sexual 
harassment, as in Clarence 
Thomas-Anita Hill, has dwin- 
dled significantly over the 
past year, the pain and frustra- 
tion felt by the victims of the 
crime continue to fester. 

Intimidating sexual ad- 
vances break both the will 
and spirit of the victim, per- 
petuating feelings of self- 
doubt and self-blame. Sexual 
harassment disrupts work re- 
lationships, family relation- 
ships, relationships between 
friends— it disrupts lives. 
Sexual harasssment objecti- 
fies its victims and fosters 
stereotypes, "she asked for it" 
or "he asked for it." 

The blame is obvious in all 
this, it was the perpetrator's 
fault and that person needs to 
be taken care of through legal 
avenues. 

The victim, however, has a 
responsibility outside of tak- 
ing legal actions against the 
accused. The victim carries, 



however unfair, the ultimate 
responsibility of healing the 
wounds created by the crime 
of another person. 

He or she needs to confront 
the shame, hate, and pain be- 
ing felt. Healing often begins 
with counseling. He or she 
must admit the anguish and 
take the step towards regam- 
ing natural lifestyle. 

Most importantly, victims 
have to accept the fact that it 
was not their fault. They were 
but a means for the individual 
perpetrator's sick and twisted 
ends. 

After the victims face the re- 
ality of the crime, they have 
one last responsibility. They 
must watch for and warn oth- 
ers of the threat of sexual 
harassment. 

If a student believes he or 
she has been sexually har- 
rassed on the IPFW campus 
contact Donna Middleton. of 
the Affirmative Aciion/EEO 
Office at 481-6106.

two awards for archiicciural excel- 
lence? Thai diis building a ihc only 
one on campus designed by a faculty 
member? That this same building was 
built by students? Thai all of the 
funds for this building were donated 
from the community? Where is this 
mystery building? It is ihc Friends

for this project was the Friends of die 



University, Overall the project was a 
completely unique co-operation of

dents. The building was being used 
for outdoor classes even before it was 
completed. It already has been used 
for events ranging from concerts to 
prayer meetings. This summer there

Writer blasted 

To the Editor: 

Three times in one letter, 1 was sum- 
marily reminded of the local pro-abor- 
tion (not pro-choice, as will be shown 
later) movement's claimed reverence 
for life after birth, and the benign 
view which most of its members cvi- 
dcndy have toward the taking of prc- 
binh life largely by our self-seeking 
culture. 

The first point in Mr. JcfT Bmnson's 
article last week jumped at me us, 
"Oliver North is a snake, he gives 
weapons to anyone who pays for 
dicm. he condones die killing of Cen- 
tral American cidzens, and ,,," While 
some American covert operations may 
not be scrupulous, 1 cun'i help bul 
think that some of Mr. Brunson's 
thoughts are the off spin of political 
paranoia. The most important point 
aboui ihe spiel made over North, 
Nicaraguon Contras, and the associat- 
ed subject matter is these subjects 
have at best an Indirect relevance to 
the murder pre-birih abortion is. Even 
if the U,S. were as guilty of war 
crimes ns Mr. Brunson alleges, he 
fails to address Ihc Issue of life before 
birth; the unborn are still also inno- 
cent victims of its fellow man. If the 
U.S. were this gravely involved in 
other world affairs, it is not condoned 
by me. hut "two wrongs don't make a 
right," 

The second point in Mr. Brunson's 
article was basically a restatement of 
the first, except he targeted a local 
personality. Kent Ziesslcr, more than 
the much maligned Col, Nordi. Hav- 
ing not been at the give-and-take in- 
volving Mr. Brunson and Mr. Zicssler, 
I shall not conclude Utc dialogue of ei- 
dier was (lawlessly scrupulous. How- 
ever, if Mr, Ziesster did indicate his 
desire for jail terms "or worse" for 
survivors of illegal abortions, Mr. 
Brunson should have expanded on "or 
worse"; he had no problem expanding 
on America's supposed atrocities in 
Central America or on his version of 
most pro-life organizations' social 
agendas. 

The third point, once again, is a rein- 
forcement of the first (or first two. if 
diey arc different). While imbibing 
die latter diird of Mr. Branson's arti- 
cle, a stunning thought hit me; he sure 
knows plenty about events he has cov- 
ered little of! What a journalist; just 
diink how good he could be if he wit- 
nessed more such events himself. 

Mr. Brunson's answer to me on this 
subject would doubUes&amp; be. die mass 
media is controlled by die power elite 
in diis country. Given diis as'sumptioii, 
dicn, I find ironic die fact Sam Don- 
aldson can use a television commen- 
tary such as "48 Hours" to expose 
such governmental blunders as the 
mindless bureaucracy which is preva- 
lent (diis is just one example) wiihoul 
fear of political reprisal. 

Finally, if Mr Brunson is indeed so 
concerned with compassion for the 
world's innocents, his pro-aboriion 
stance txilics diis. If such people were 
truly pro-choice, and not pro-abortion. 
they would have received all Ihey 
seek twenty years ago from the 
Supreme Court. However, they have 
the aborUon rights and die availability 
they deem so necessary, and yet diey 
want more; ihcy want no lestriction.s, 
no choice on pan of the taxpayer to 
fund abortion, and no obligation on 
anyone's pan lo evaluate his/her par- 
ticular situation before making a deci- 
sion. The last claim is verified by 
many abortion-rights activists' assail- 
ing of die Supreme Court's decision to 
uphold Pennsylvania's 24-hour wail- 
ing period. If some of the desires just 
mentioned aren't properly attributed 
to Mr, Branson, then perhaps he isn't 
pro-aboruon; however, by reading his 
laujsi article and other wriiings of his, 
I will go on a limb and guess he is,

Name-calling unfair 



TotheEdilor; 

In response lo Die Jan. 28 cdiioriiil 
by Jeff Branson, I, loo, as an evan- 
gelical Christian, have been per- 
plexed by Uic Christian conununiiy's 
seeming inicnwining of God's will 
wiih ihe C.O.P. Platform, in light of 
Qie pany's dcsiniciivc foreign policy 
dealings. Film fooiage I saw of a 
Kurdish refugee caravan being 
strafed by Iraqi "copiers after Bush 
reneged on his promise lo aid ihe 
Kurds, combined wiih die continued 
friendliness lo red China after the 
Tianenmen Square massacre con- 
vinced me I could not vote for him. 
And yes, I agree that ihe pro-life 
communiiy's sponsorship of Oliver 
North's appearance is indeed 
questionable. 

However, the point the writer is 
trying to make- that pro-life activists 
care only about the fetus and the 
needs of the living are irrelevant to 
them- is pretty weak. Those in- 
volved in anti-abortion activity are 
only a small segment of the total 
Christian community. Christians 
worldwide are involved in poor re- 
lief, hospitals, feeding the hungry, 
literacy, vocational training, and lob- 
bying for human rights and social 
justice. Such groups as Compassion 
International, The Salvation Army, 
Catholic Charities, and Evangelicals 
for Social Action are perfoiming the 
humanitarian acts everyday that the 
writer claims go wanting, A few 
Christians feel a conviction to op- 
pose abortion actively and devote 
Iheir lime to that end. Others feel 
called to seive in those other areas 
of human need. It's just that Randall 
Terry pointing defiantly into the 
camera makes for a belter soundbite 
on the evening news Uian headlines 
like "thousands of hospitals cared 
for the sick yci another day," or "re- 
lief workers cared for some more or- 
phans again today" Among even die 
evangelical community, some, in- 
cluding mc. don't agree with the tac- 
tics of Opcraiion Rescue. Some of 
those in O.R. are my friends, even 
though we may disagree. 1 say this 
to point out the room for diversity 
with the Christian community. It is 
not the faceless theocratic jugger- 
naut some imagine. 



In ihe pasi. 1 have perceived that 
TTie Communicator prints editorials 
sometimes to inform and persuade, 
or at other times {as I suspect with 
the Brunson piece) to inflame and 
generate lettas to prim. Frankly, the 
pro- and anti-abortion rhetoric in 
The Communicator and other papers 
is getting really tiresome. The abor- 
tion battle will not be won in the 
Letters lo the Editor column. 

To the pro-life community, can we 
agree that abortion is but a symptom 
of greater societal problems, and that 
fighting abortion at the doorstep on 
Webster Street is a little late in the 
game? Can we continue to fund poor 
relief and education while pushing 
for sane policies by our govemmeni 
on preserving human rights here and 
abroad? Can we refrain from harass- 
ment and gluing locks that only 
serve to sour people to our cause? 

To the pro-choice people, can we 
agree that the fewer abortions that 
are performed on women, the better? 
If the issue is really choice, can we 
be equally satisfied if a woman 
chooses an aliemaUve to abortion? 
Abortions can't be the best choice 
every time. 

To The Communicator, can you 
state your views in reasonably word- 
ed fashion without fueling the iire by 
resorting to loading wordings like 
"anti-choice," "paranoid millenial- 
ism," and "theocratic" student gov- 
ernment? Kent Zicssler of Inter Var- 
sity ChristiMi Fellowship is pan of a 
"fringe-right religious group?" 
C'mon. my parents taught me that 
the person who resorts to name-call- 
ing has already lost the argument, 
Kent is one of the nicest people I've 
met. Fringe right indeed! I haven't 
seen any inbred, beady-eyed, belli- 
cose. Bible-thumpers in black 
prowling the campus lately, though 
some of my cohorts in Christ are on 
the Dean's List- go figure. So much 
for stereotyping! Well, you generat- 
ed a letter. Not a flood of Bible vers- 
es, just a plea for reason from all 
sides of the issue.

Term paper deadlines provoke panic attacks 



It is Friday. Your 35 source. 15 page 
term paper is due on Monday. You 
currently have 4 sources and have 
had a sudden inexplicable attack of 
total and complete impassioned apa- 
thy toward your subject, which is the 
Evolution of Garden Slugs. You are 
beginning to enter the eighth Stage of 
Deadline Writmg; Panic, 

But before panicking, your mind (in 
a clearly presentable and organized 
fashion) reviews all of 
the Stages of Deadline 
Writing, in clironologi- 
cal order. 

Stage 1: Annoyance. 
Your instractor first in- 
flicts this assignment 
on you, "Damn." you 
CJ(Claim. "I'm already 
working on two other 
papers, I've got four 
cuams to study for. I 
haven't any shoes and I 
have to walk through 
eight miles of snow to 
get home, not to men- 
tion the fact that I have 
to work 20 hours a day in thai sewage 
plant to pay for my dear mother's 
hernia operation," You then remem- 
ber that you arc confusing your life 
with that of the characters on "Little 
House on the Prairie." This is your 
first indication Ihai you should proba- 
bly up the dosage on your stress pills. 

Stage 2: Optimism, Once you ac- 
cept the reality of this assignment and 
realize dial the nagging feeling of re- 
sponsibility won't go away without 
actual work, you choose your topic: 
The Evolution of Garden Slugs. You 
lell yourself this is a perfect topic, be- 
cause you read a National Geograph- 
ic aructe about slugs just lost week, 
and you think they are fascinating 
creatures. Also, your uncle raises 
slugs, so you could get lots of great 
information and quotes from him. 



w"^ 



Stage 3: Denial. Having decided on 
your topic a full month before die pa- 
per is due. you convince yourself that 
you have oodles of time. Your con- 
science now saiisried. you throw all 
thoughts of this assignment into your 
subconcious for the next three weeks. 
Stage ■): Awakening. You sit bolt 
upright in your bed at three in the 
morning to remember that your 35 
source, 15 page term paper is due in 
less than a week, and 
all you have so far is a 
topic. 

Stage S: Optimism 
#2. While showering 
die next morning, you 
plan out your entire pa- 
per. "OK." you say, 
"I'll go to the library 
today, get all of my 
sources, then I'll have a 
full 6 days to throw this 
paper together." While 
in your car, on your 
way to the library, sud- 
den (lashes of brilliance 
flood your mind. "Hey. 
rite the paper from the 
slug's point of view! What a great 
idea! My instructor will love the orig- 
inality! I'm gonna ace this!" 

Stage 6: Despair. After four hours 
in die library, all you can find on your 
subject are children's encyclopedia 
entries, wiUi information like, "Gar- 
den slugs live in gardens." You can't 
find thai article that you read in Na- 
tional Geographic. You can't find any 
of die hundrctls of articles about gar- 
den slugs diat you remember reading 
weeks ago. when it seemed you 
couldn't open any magazine without 
hearing about diosc damn slugs. The 
computer catalog shows lilies like 
"Everything you ever wanted to 
know about garden slugs, but were 
afraid to ask," and "Smitly's Com- 
plete Encyclopedia of Slug Evolu-

items aic located ai Ojiford Universi-

shelf. 

When you get home from the li- 
brary, you call your uncle. He re- 
minds you that he raises worms, not 
Slugs. 

During Stage 6, the tnorc neurotic 
person will have a Stuart Smalley At- 
tack. You will Stan saying things like. 
"I can't write. I'm no good. What a 
stupid idea, to write it from the slug's 
point of view. My instructor has 
probably read hundreds of papers on 
the Evolution of the Garden Slug. I'm 
noi original. I'll get an "F" and I'll 
flunk out of school and have to go 
work at my tmcle's gas station." 

Slage 7; Bitterness. You rant about 
ihe school's curriculum. "Why do 1 
have to do a stupid research paper, 
anyway?! When am I ever going to 
need any of this information? What 
the hell do garden slugs have to do 
with nursing?! Nurses haven't used 
slugs for years!" 



Slage 8: Pun\c- At this point, you 
arc throwing down the stress pills like 
M and M's. 

Stage 9: Blurry Caffeine-Main- 
tained Fervor. This is a 3- to 6-hour 
period when you write 80% of ihc pa- 
per. Your goal for this paper, which 
once was "to write the most original, 
insightful and bcsi researched paper 
ever," is now "to finish it." You have 
left all your plans of witty quips, in- 
telligent observations, and relevant 
facts by the wayside, and now your 
only desire in life is lo recall that 
damn word that has slipped your 
mind; dial word thai you've used 400 
billion times in your life, but now. 
when you really nc«d it. is nowhere 
10 be found. 

Stage 10: Relief. You are finished. 
You never, ever. ever, ever want to 
hear about slugs again. With a deep 
sigh, you turn in your paper. 

Moments later, your instructor in- 
nicis the ne^l project upon you. Go 
back 10 Stage I. (Repeal until

Who's the real winner? 



By Michiid Etau 
Sports Editor 

In all ihc world, nothing is mote 
siimulaiing and more cxciiJng ihcn 
Ihcihniiofcompctiuon. 

Since man has come onio ihis canh 
he/she has always compcicd, From 
Rome until now. il is a large pari of 
iJic society and the culliirc of every 
nation. 

Almost any person, if asked, can 
name a do/.cn competitive games 
they have played or watched. From 
football and hockey to Taboo and 
Monopoly people have found games 
thai lit ibem. 

And in all these games 
lies one goal, one chal- 
lenge, and one moiivaiion: 
ihc goal 10 win. To win 
means lo be die victor by 
scoring or not scoring, by being 
faster or smancr. or by jusi being 
lucky. 

If a person docs not win then ihcy 
fall in Ihc category of loser. A sim- 
ple, bui cffeciivc method to belter 
mind and body. Bui what about 
something far more important, whai 
about character? 

Is il Hue dial if a person does not 
lose Ihcy win? After all Uiese years 
of winners being wiruicrs and losers 
being losers, could a winner actually 
be the loser and vice versa? Yes, it is 
most definiiely possible. 

Tlie U.S. Dream Team was the vic- 
tor in the Olympics this pasi year. 
Charles Barklcy played on the 
Dream Team and that makes him a 
winner, right? 

WRONG! Barkley tost that sum- 
mer He was a man whose altitude 
diminished the ociiemcnt of the 
victories. He beliiilcd ihe oihcr 
teams and matte a loial ass out of 



. In the 
winner. 



himself and possibly out of all the 
United Stales of America. 

No matter what ihe outcome, a 
winner and lo.scr must be defined on 
an individual basis. Each person 
comes out as a wmner or loser de- 
pending on what he/she achieved on 
a"charaaer"le¥el. 

Becoming a winner, no matter if 
succeeding or failing, all depends on 
how hard one tries and by what atti- 
tude one takes. 

Unfonunatcly, "characier" docs not 
maitcr to some. These people be- 
lieve a winner is someone who 
brings home a victory, who brings in 
the crowd, or who brings in 
the money. 

Professional and colle- 
giate spons arc often guid- 
ed by these ain 
owners eyes, Barkley is 
and m their eyes losers need to be 
goiien rid of - no matter how hard 
they try. 

Even more tragic is the fact that 
many of uS Americans accept this 
way of life. We close out the things 
thai arc really important and we 
close out who we really are. 

This country is made up of winners 
and losers and many people may nol 
know where they fall, and if they do 
know, they may be using the wrong 
guidelines to tell. 

Competition is a very important 
means for growing, but it is impor- 
tant lo remember thai it not only 
builds the mind and body, but that it 
builds character too. 

In the end victory, is unimportant. 
What matters is what each person 
becomes dirough competition. Look 
at yourself, do you ihink you've be- 
come a winner or a loser? You de- 
cide, the ball's in your coun now.

The team rallied behind senior

ihe rest of the crowd around them, 
and according to Charles Cf^land. a 
member of Phi Kappa, Thcin they 
even have to motivate the cheerlead- 
ers sometimes. 

"I \hink that ihe only way that this

ment, spirit, and pride in itself is 
through athletics," said Ross Bourn- 
gardncry, Grandpopah of Phi Kappa 
Theta. 

Baumgardnery believes thai a good

apari from another and wants lo see

maybe one day include a football

After his presentation, Pelczar cor-

The Communist Party closed down 
Jaggieltonian University's medical 
school in the 1950's. Pelc^ar is ex-

Pelczar described Jagiellonian Uni-

respected universities in Europe, be- 
ginning May 12, 1364. The Queen 
of Jagiellonia, in 1399. bequeathed

"We chose lo elect our rector in a

all over the world, including 10 
American universities, such a,s Stan-

Pelczar would like to see faculty and 
student exchanges with IPFW and 
was planning to discuss this before 
leaving for Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

One great difficulty, Pelczar stated, 
was monetary. The polish economy 
and job market are not stable yet. 

The price of airline tickets from 
Poland to the U.S. are astronomical-

would have to be found before any 
exchanges could occur. 

Pelczar was hopeful that arrange- 
mcnts agreeable to all will be found 
so both JaggielloTiian University and 
IPFW could benefit from cultural 
and intellectual exchanges. 



Blindness does not disable Borst 



By Kay Minima 
Foolprints Editor 

Randy Borst. director of the Office 
of Students with Disabilities, has 
first-hand knowledge of being mis- 
trcaicd because of his visual 
impairment. 

Borst. whose mother and grand- 
mother are legally blind, was bom 
with (he same disability. His Arsi 20 
years were lived in abject poverty in a 
housing project in Hammond, IN. 

The Hammond School System iricd 
10 leach Borst to read; however, after 
the school found he was unable to sec 
the print, he was sent for a quarter of 
the day to work with a special educa- 
tion teacher who knew Braille. , 

As the only blind student in the 
school system, they couldn't justify 
giving Botsi a special icachcr, so his 
luior worked with the moderately 
mentally retarded students. 

"It was my first exposure lo the faci 
that even if one really were mentally 
retarded — dcvclopmcntally disabled 
is the current term — there can still be 
a high degree of moral development." 
Borst commented. 

"It appeared to mc early in life that 
those kids, and they ranged in age 
from maybe ten years old to 16 or 17, 
they had jusi as much of a good sense 
of what was right and what was 
wrong as anybody else," explained 
Borsi. "And of course, you learn very 
young thai some people who are very 



inielligeni don'i have a good sense at 
all." 

By the time Borst reached adoles- 
cence, he had become a poor siudcni. 
Pre-recorded materials were always 
late, and living on welfare did not 
help his social image. 

Middle school and the first couple 
of years of high school were difTiculi. 
He took on the problems of adoles- 
cence and the difficulties of dealing 
with teachers whom Borst thought 
didn't like him very much. 




Borst now rellctls on his high 
school treatment with a different per- 
spective. He fell very lonely and re- 
jected by both the students and a 
school system that didn't know what 
to do with him, 

Borst, although legally blind, has 
20/160 vision. This means that he 



Panelists examine civil rights 



By Ben Solero 
Managing Editor 

A pane! discussion held Thursday. 
Jan. 28, in Walb Memorial Union 
showcased several distinguished 
black Fort Wayne and surrounding 
community members who answered 
questions concerning the Civil Rights 
Movement, The panel included: 
Payne Brown, director of Public 
Safely, City of Fon Wayne; Thomas 
Essex, Wayne Township trustee; 
James Pitts, vice chancellor for acad- 
emic affairs, Manchester College; J. 
Tamir Rashecd, imam; Charles Redd,

Williams, social worker, Fon Wayne 
State Developmental Center. Rosetta 
Moses-Hill, inierim chief executive 
officer. Fort Wayne Urban League, 
moderated the discussion. 

The panelists were asked five pre- 
determined questions about blacks in 
the United States, which were seg- 
mented in historical reference from 
the bcgitming of slavery to the pre- 
sent and beyond. A segment was also 
added for audience comments and 
questions at the end. 

The theme of the discussion sur- 
rounded the history of slavery and 
Manin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm

pilot a car down the road, although he 
would miss seeing things like chil- 
dren and Volkswagons, 

Borst became Director of the Office 
of Students with Disabilities in Au- 
gust of 1990. When he came he found 
some stress Iwiwecn his office and 
many other university depanmcnis. 

He gives consideration lo others and 
hopes to receive the same considera- 
tion. Borst intercedes between the 
professors and the disabled students 
by clarifying any misunderstandings 
which may crop up. 

"We explain, we consult, we de- 
scribe, wc suggest aliemaiives but the 
primary relationship is between the 
student and I think thai a lot of olTices 
of this kind try to be the univcrsily 
for the students and 1 don't do thai," 
Borsi commented. 

"Again. I'm there to learn and 
share, not to Tighi and insist," Borsi 
explained, "Wc have a grievance pro- 
cedure if it came down lo that." 

The office is open to all students 
sviih disabilities, whether Ihe disabili- 
ty is pemianeni or temporary. It also 
provides services including scribes 
for the writing disabled, readers for 
the vision disabled, and language in- 
lerprctcrs for the hearing disabled, 

Borst says his office is blessed by 
the number of volunieers.
