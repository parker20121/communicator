Educators appreciated for excellent teaching 



by Mishanna Wood 

News Editor 

S sixteen faculty mem- 
bers of IPFW were 
nominated for the 
Who's Who Among 
America's Teachers 
1998 fiflh edilion. 
They were nominated by former 
students who were on the National 
Dean's list or Who's Who Among 
American High School Students. 

Who's Who Among America's 
Teachers honors teachers who went 
the extra mile or made a significant 
difference in getting a point across. 
IPFW's nominees include Mary 
Danius Cooper, professor of dental 
education; Mohammed S. Alam, 
professor of electrical engineering; 
Donna M. Bialik, chair and associ- 
ate professor of economics; Avon 
Crismorc, associate professor of 
English; David A. Dilts, professor 
of economic and labor relations; 



Ronald J. Duchovic, associate pro- 
fessor of chemistry; Arthur W. 
Fricdel, professor of chemistry; 
David L. Faircnild, chair and pro- 
fessor of philosophy; Hedayeh 
Samavatie, associate professor of 
economics; Lawrence J. Haber, 
associate professor of economics; 
Lucille K. Hess, associate professor 
of audiology and speech sciences; 
John G. LaMaster, instructor in 
mathematical sciences; Paul I-Hai 
Lin, associate professor of electrical 
and computer engineering technolo- 
gy; Michael R. Nusbaumer, profes- 
sor of sociology and Richard A. 
Pacer, professor of chemistry. 

In January, selected educators 
were notified of their nominations 
by mail. 

One hundred and thirty thou- 
sand teachers were recognized and 
appreciated for ibeir work in this 
edition. 

Who's Who Among America's 
Teachers was first published in 
1990 to honor educators. 



It is updated every two years 
and serves as a source to new teach- 
ers or students seeking mentors. 

The Who's Who is published in 
four regional volumes and is free to 
the ten largest public libraries, state 
libraries and state superintendents 
of education. 

This book was meant to serve as 
a motivator for teachers and a dis- 
play of appreciation by students and 
co-workers. 



"I'm just doing 
my job. It's what 
I do because I'm 
a teacher." 

Ronald Duchovic, 

associate professor, 

chemistry 



The IPFW educators nominated 
all have different approaches to 
leaching and motivating their 
students. 

"This is quite gratifying being 
nominated by a principle student," 
Haber said. 

Haber has taught at IPFW 
sincel981.This is the first award of 
this type that he has received. 

Economics involves a mathe- 
matical background and Haber tries 
to provide as many examples as 
possible. 

"1 have a different background. 
I'm trained in science and philoso- 
phy and tend to lean that way in my 
approach." Haber said. "1 give 
examples to help them; some people 
appreciate that arid others don't." 

Crismore encourages students 
not to give up when the going gets 
tough. 

"I like to take time 10 speak to 
students and give them feedback," 
Crismore said. 

Duchovic is very pleased that 



he was nominated. 

"I guess I was gratified 
that it was made by a former 
student," Duchovic said. 
"I'm just doing my job. It's 
what I do because I'm a 
teacher," he said of the 
Who's Who award. 

"I make use of exams as 
learning tools, not simply as 
a way to get a grade. 
Students can redo problems 
and get back what they 
lost," Duchovic said. 

"You can release your 
understanding of a concept. 
If you can do that success- 
fully then you can under- 
stand the concept," be 
added. 

"I try to put myself in 
the student's position and 
ask myself what I would do 
if I was a student," Alam 
said. "This is a pleasant sur- 
prise to be recognized." 




The book contains bio- 
graphical information on 
1 30,000 Midwest teachers.

The Nalu people of the West African Coast used this

Funds and student needs 
to be addressed at Luncheon 



by Mishanna Wood 



sponsor the second annual 
Legislative Issues Luncheon in 
Walb Ballroom from 1 1 a.m. to 
1 p.m. 

The two main issues that 
will be discussed arc equity 
funding and the needs of stu- 
dents and faculty. 

IPFW is one of the lowest 
funded of Indiana state schools. 

For example, IPFW offers 
just as many programs as 
IUPUI and receives much less 



funding. 

"Money is needed to buy 
equipment to put in the campus 
buildings and keep IPFW on 
the cutting edge," said Jennifer 
Bosk, director of alumni 
relations. 

These two topics are tied 
together. Without money the 
technology can't be purchased, 
which lakes away from getting 
the best education possible. 

"Legislators prefer to hear 
the voice of the students. The 
loudest voice they heard last 
year was from students," Bosk 
said. 

Bosk emphasized that it is 
important for students to 
explain why they need certain 



types of equipment 

The cost is 58 for students 
and faculty and S10 for (he 
general public. The alumni 
office is making reservations at 
481-6807 before Nov. 10. 

Some areas are sponsoring 
students to attend the luncheon 
for free such as health sciences, 
SPEA, and Alumni Relations. 

The luncheon will open 
with Walt Branson. IPFW vice 
chancellor for financial affairs, 
speaking on IPFW legislative 
issues today. 

Phil Laux, president of the 
Fort Wayne Chamber of 
Commerce, will speak on 
IPFW community impact and 
Tom Guthrie, associate profes- 



sor of SPEA, will express 
IPFW faculty needs. 

Jim Papagiannis. a market- 
ing major, will deal with stu- 
dent needs and Ron Buskirk, 
chair of the government and 
university relations committee, 
will conclude with IPFW 
Alumni support 

Legislators such as Ben 
Giaquinta and Richard 
Worman will be present. 

When ihe luncheon is com- 
plete, the speakers and legisla- 
tors will have time to answer 
questions and hear the needs of 
IPFW. 

"The alumni are pleased to 
offer this real life experience," 
Bosk said. 



Students, teachers, to discuss classes without a room 



by Mishanna Wood 

News Editor 

FACET, Faculty Colloquium on 
Excellence in leaching, will be discussing 
the quality of distance learning in "Closing 
the Distance," tomorrow at a teleconfer- 
ence in the Hclmke Library from 9 a.m. to 
11 ajn. 

Distance learning refers to those stu- 
dents who lake classes via internet, inter- 
active video and television. 

Students who have taken such classes 
and FACET members wdl have the chance 
10 discuss the advantages and disadvan- 
tages of this teaming atmosphere. 

FACET is funded by the president of 
IU Bloomington and consists of teachers 
selected by a university wide committee to 
improve the quality of education for stu- 
dents. 

FACET members are nominated once 



a year and must present a ten-page dossier 
to faculty including a personal statement 
about teaching philosophy and statements 
and letters of recommendations. 

There is a FACET group for all of the 

"The program is a 
very effective way 
to bring very good 
faculty together 
across the whole 
university, not just 
to reward and serve 
their needs." 

Eileen Bender, 

IUSB director, 

FACET program 



IU campuses. 

"The program is a very effective way 
to bring very good faculty together across 
the whole university, not just to reward and 
serve their needs. Everyone can be sent 
back with new ideas," said Eileen Bender, 
IUSB director of FACET program. 

The IU Faculty Leadership Institute is 
held early in June, and campuses send 
teams to spend a week in Indianapolis. 

All the campuses discuss their ideas 
for the year with administrators. 

"This is a great opportunity for faculty 
to gel together and keep them excited 
about teaching." Katharine Karl, SPEA 
director at IUSB, said 

The book "More Quick Hits," pub- 
lished by the IU press, demonstrates vari- 
ous teaching strategies that have worked 
for various professors 

This is one final project that FACET 
has made to improve teaching techniques. 



Citizens Action Coalition works with finance 



by Carrie Anne Leathers 
Chief Reporter 

In an effort to help citizens take 
control of their government. 
Indiana's own Citizens Action 
Coalition Education Fund, CACEF 
will be holding a public hearing on 
campaign finance reform. 

By working with the CACEF, 
citizens will be able to help shape 
campaign finance reform proposals 
that will be presented to the 1999 
Indiana General Assembly. 

"People don't realize how much 
power they have," Regional 
Organizer for the CACEF Tim Stelle 



said "We can write any law we 
want This is a democracy. If there is 
something that we arc angry about, 
we can come to a consensus as to 
how we can change that situation 
and then we can do it." 

According to Stelle, despite the 
fact that elections have already 
occurred, now is an important time 
to make changes. 

"Since the Supreme Court has 
ruled spending caps to be unconsti- 
tutional, we'll be looking at ideas 
such as public financing of elections 
so that candidates will be less 
dependent upon narrow, private, 
interests to run campaigns," Stelle 
said. "We'll also be looking at mak- 



ing political contributions so that 
they are not tax exempt For individ- 
uals, that can be a serious consider- 
ation as to whether or not they write 
that check." 

Over 20 years ago. the Citizens 
Energy Coalition formed in 
response for the need of energy 
companies and utilities to be kept in 
balance. 

The group evolved into the 
Citizens Action Coalition Education 
Fund and dealt with problems per- 
taining to home health care and the 



"We work in both the legal and 
legislative arena," Stelle said. "If 
there is a bad bill, we work to kill it 



and if there is a good bill, we work 
to help it get enough votes to make 
it through the Assembly." 

In the past, the CACEF has 
taken utility companies to court for 
breaking laws and having unfair 
prices for the consumer. 

Often, the CACEF wins, despite 
all the money being used by the 
companies in the trial. 

"We take utility companies to 
court and we beat them," Stelle said. 
"If people choose to do so, we can 
easily reform the process by which 
political campaigns are funded in a 
way that restores people's faith in 
the democratic process and in demo- 
cratic institutions." 



According to Stelle. the reper- 
cussions of the current campaign 
finance system "filter out" all candi- 
dates except those who will repre- 
sent the issues of those who can 
afford to make financial contribu- 
tions to campaigns. 

"If corporation X writes a check 
to a candidate and that candidate 
wins, what obligation docs that can- 
didate have to the interest of the cor- 
poration?" Stelle said. 

"The political expense to run in 
a campaign filters out candidates 
who want to run and serve the 
public. People who may represent 
the majority of the people don't 
have the money to win." 



Primarily, the public hearing 
will give the CACEF a chance to 
share with the public bow they can 
get involved and make a difference 
in the way campaigns are allowed to 
be legally financed. 

"People need to decide for 
themselves what they want," Stelle 
said. "We are not looking to be lead- 
ers here. We just want to get people 
to recognize that it's their govern- 
ment"

Student Government 



To the Student Body, 

Student government here at IPFW is 
growing at an excellent rate. We have more 
re pre sen tati ves than we have had in the past 
two years. This is still not good enough!! 
We need more student involvement on Ibis 
campus. Student government can help 
make life on this campus more rewarding, 
more convenient, and more socially memo- 
rable. All we need is more ideas and student 
voices. 

Student government is working hard 
right now on a calculator program to help 
save students money. Studenl Senator Nick 
Gray pioneered the program. Nick has been 
working diligently with the Student Affairs 
Committee to gel this program started by 
next semester. The student calculator pro- 
gram would enable students to use a calcu- 
lator for a small fee. This is an excellent 
opportunity for students who do not have to 
take a great deal of Math courses to gradu- 



ate. The students can use the calculator for 
the class, return it to Student Government, 
and save the money that would normally be 
used to buy the calculator that would not be 
used after the class is finished. 

Another project that needs more stu- 
denl involvement is the recycling program 
here on campus. Again Student Affairs 
Committee (beaded by Jennifer Wolfe) has 
been working with Biology Club to make 
recycling bins more readily available to stu- 
dents. The problem with the current recy- 
cling situation is the number of bins avail- 
able to put cans and paper in, and also the 
procedure to get the cans and paper to a 
recycling center on a regular basis. Putting 
a can or a piece of paper in a bin is just the 
beginning, the students as a whole need to 
gel the products that need recycled to recy- 
cling centers. This is a big project and 
needs the help and commitment of the stu- 
denl body. 

Ryan Smith and the excellent crew over 



in Student Activities have had an excellent 
year thus far in reaching students. With 
excellent activities such as the Virtual 
Reality, the Tonic Sol Fa concert, and 
comedian Rondell Sheridan to name a few, 
studenl activities has even better plans for 
the students of this campus. Like all studenl 
groups, Student Activities could use stu- 
dents to help forward their mission on this 
campus. 

If anyone has any ideas or would like to 
help in these major projects, feel free lo 
contact the Studenl Government office at 
481-6586 and we in Student government 
would be happy to answer questions, get 
your ideas in motion, or show you how you 
can help. 



Your Student Body Vice President, 

Joseph B Schroeder 




1 actually saw Christmas decorations at 
the mall last weekend. Is it me, or do we 
have to be exposed to ibis before 
Halloween? Call me old-fashioned, but 
isn'i the official day AFTER 
Thanksgiving? Next year, we should just 
start the onslaught right after the 4th of 
July, or how about after St. Patrick's Day? 
You know what, how about just celebrating 
Christmas all year 'round? I mean, people 
are nicer at this time of the year anyway. 
We donate to charity, say "please" and 
"thank you," spend more time with our 
families, and just seem to be in belter 
moods 

I've always been offended by the mar- 
keting of Christmas anyway. It is hard to 
understand how we lost the spiritual con- 
nection with Christmas. Isn't this supposed 
to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ? Even 
if you weren't that religious, wasn't it fun 
to explore the imaginative world of the 
Bible your family used? Sure it was fun 
believing in Santa Clause, reindeer, and 
elves, but wasn't it fascinating to know that 
the birth of Christ was the reason we got 
two weeks off from school? I went 10 
Catholic school for twelve years; maybe 
thai is why I'm the way 1 am. I just get sick 
of the commercialism. It seems as if we 



Random Musings 



Well, 1 m not sure why I'm wriung this, 
perhaps to avoid my math and my land- 
lords. Maybe I'm avoiding my math and 
my landlords. 

The other day, 1 was going to study in 
ihe lounge of the library, which proved lo 
be more of a social setting than a study area 
It was a very cold and crisp evening in the 
latter half of October, you know when the 
leaves are in their prime lights of gold, 
orange yellow and red, not yet the fragile 
brown leaf that can disintegrate in your 
band like an ancient manuscript might. 

The peak of fall. I should say it was. 1 
walked into the lounge with the wooden 
tables and black tiled floor, and listened dis- 



have completely lost touch with our reli- 
gious heritage as a country. 

Let me just get this off of my chest, 
also: The Christmas decorations in this 
town prove that the Christian community is 
basically a willing participant in X-mas 
overkill. X-mas, what the bell is X-mas 
anyway? When people gel mad, they don' t 
scream "Jesus X!" Let's take ihe "X" out 
of Christmas, could we please? Fon Wayne 
residents need to settle down on this whole 
decorating thing. Easter, Halloween, 
Christmas, is there a seasonal holiday that 
wc can just celebrate and enjoy without 
some of you guys decorating every tree in 
your yard with some ugly lights? How 
about donating the money you would nor- 
mally spend on decorations and electricity 
lo a local charity? I know you wouldn't be 
able lo impress your neighbors and friends, 
but wouldn't you feel better about your- 
self? The arrogance of outdoing each other 
at this time of the year proves thai we have 
lost touch with what Christmas is supposed 
to be all about. For those of you that put up 
5000 lights and a bunch of plastic lawn 
ornaments, I feel sorry for you. Remember 
less is more. 

The Santa thing doesn't bug me as 
' m pretty much used lo 



tressingly to the buzz of the students. 

Some poked their noses up lo see who 
caused the door to open. Others continued 
lo study and small groups engaged in their 
private conversations. 

At least the lounge was an inn from the 
cold and I knew hot chocolate awaited in 
the vending machines along the north wall. 
As I slowly walked toward the machine, I 
noted the reflection of the students from the 
sort, yet adequate, lightning of the room. 

How CAN they study amongst this 
noise? I'll never know the answer to thai 
question. 

Can they really block each other out so 
sufficiently? Isn't it funny how we can 



seeing three or four a day during the sea- 
son. I think the black Santa is pretty cool 
The first time I saw a black Santa was on 
the south side of Chicago at a Catholic 
Church my mom went to as a child. I think 
I was about eight years old. I asked her why 
Santa was black, and she told me: "You 
didn't think that only white people cele- 
brated Christmas did you?" It was pro- 
found, and at that moment I realized that 
the whole globe celebrated December 25 in 
some way or another. I felt good about 
being a Catholic. I fell good about having 
something in common with black people. I 
felt comfortable about sharing Christmas 
with people I never met, and it was great. 

The industry that promotes Christmas 
the most is, as we all know, the retail indus- 
try. Talk about in your face. They don't 
even have cool commercials anymore. 
Remember the Budweiser Clydesdales 
marching through the snow pulling a sled 
lo a dimly lit cabin in the woods? Or who 
could ever forget the classic and best 
Christmas commercial of all time. Some of 
you are probably too young to remember 
this one.

choose what we want to pay attention lo 
and truly learn about and what we don't? 

Hmm think about it. How we pick and 

choose what we want to know? 

Well anyway, back lo my story. I got 
out of the lounge carefully as not to spill my 
drink It was just too noisy in there and I 
decided to go lo another building. 

1 arrived at my new destination, 
relieved from the cold with half a cup of 
chocolate. The other half was spilled on the 
journey. 

Only I found ibis place just as unsatis-

Topic: 

John Glenn: Back in 
Space 

What we think: 

What about the other six 
people that are there 
with him? 



We heard a funny joke the other 
day. What do NASA and Viagra have 
in common? 

They are both about getting old 
men back up. So it wasn't that funny. 

While we admit that John Glenn is 
a hero, he isn't exactly in tune with 
our generation. 

I'm sure that our parents feel dif- 
ferently about him than we do, but he 
is just another person who did some- 
thing a long time ago. 

It's a lot like our being fans of Joe 
Namatb. 

Sure they both did something 
great, but it's not anything that's on 
the minds of today's young adults. 

When was the last time 
you heard of anything really 
coming out of the space pro- 
gram that was just so amazing 
Hi ji you wanted to be a part of 



It was probably in a movie 
such as "Deep Impact" or 
"Armageddon." 

We do have to admit that it 
was a little intriguing when 
they landed that rover on 
Mars to do some exploration, 
but then the rover was lost on 
the planet's surface after a 
short while. 

How come the people on 
the mission with the great and 
mighty (77 year-old) John 
Glenn aren't mentioned much? 

Could it be that this trip 
with John Glenn is just a big 
stunt to get people interested 



in the Space Program again? 

Do you see any of the other mem- 
bers of the mission on television at 
night? We don't. 

All of the people who arc on the 
mission are important, but one man 
does not need to overshadow the other 

six. 

The other six probably arc doing 
much more in ihis mission than what 
John Glenn will be doing for the space 
program for ihe rest of his life. 

It's time that new names and faces 
become prevalent when wc think about 
the space program. 

We remember being young and 
bearing that there was going to be a 
teacher in space, Christa McCauliffe. 

She was treated the same as Glenn 
was bul the media back then didn't 
forget about the rest of the crew. 

We know that Ihis was another 
publicity stunt that went awry, but (he 
crew was treated with respect both 
before and after the Challenger 
exploded. 

We feel the other six that arc on 
the mission with John Glenn arc more 
heroic than he. 

These people go about their jobs, 
receive very little, if no appreciation 
from the public and have lo let John 
Glenn take all of the limelight for the 
mission. 



"Walking in space, 
man has never 
looked more puny or 
more significant."

Coray Collection provides a look into African cultures 



by 
Adam Taylor 
Features Editor 

and 

Mlshanna Wood 

News Editor 



From Oct. 23 10 Jan 3, the Toledo Museum of An will 
have the Han Coray Collection of art from cultures of 
West and East Africa. 

The collection, world renowned for the in-depth look 
it provides into the lives of the inhabitants of the Dark 
Continent, originally consisted of approximately 2.000 
19th cenlury pieces that were pui together during ihe life 
of the Swiss teacher Han Coray. ( 1 880- 1974) also known 
as a great an patron. 

Today it is comprised or 202 pieces. 

The Nkisi. from the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo in Central Africa is a wooden power figure with a 
cavity containing herbs that mediated disputes. 

A multitude of nails prolnide from its body. 

This piece served as a type of coniract between two 
tribesmen who were at odds with each other. 

The iwo people, who would present their disagree- 
ment to a magistrate as pan of a social contract, were 
made to drive a nail into the object to serve as a visual 
reminder of their agreement. 

The nail was supposed to release the healing power 
inside. 

Should either of the parties in question refuse to 
honor their agreement, they were brought back to the 



Nkisi to remind them of Ihc nail that represented their 
word of honor. 

If they denied the agreement painful consequences 
could occur such as ostracism or death. 

In some African societies owning a horse meant 
power. 

An equestrian would literally be above all those he 
encountered. 

The equestrians had the edge in baide and always 
held the highest social positions, even though most histo- 
ry books fail to mention the fact that Africans even had 
horses incorporated into their tribal cultures. 

African hisiorians have discovered that women 
played a central role in most societies. 

They were viewed as being the givers of life and 
were more often than not elevated to high social positions 
within individual communities simply because of their 
gender. 

Women were rarely permitted to fight along side men 
in hatde for this reason. 

Since the capability to reproduce is more limited for 
women than men, the men were viewed as being more 
expendable. 

Women were therefore left with die less dangerous 
tasks such as maintaining the household and. in some 
cases, the local governments, while the men were out 
hunting and going to war. 

For this reason women can be found as a focal point 
in many of the miniatures and sculptures that comprise 
ihc Han Coray collection. 

Also found in targe quantities are ceremonial masks. 

The mask played a very large role in many tribal soci- 
eties throughout Africa, as the large number of masks that 
could be found would suggest. 

These masks are constructed of just about everything 
one could imagine, though most in the collection are

throne from the Cameroon people of West Africa. The leopard was £ 
lity for their tribe. Only royalty could associate with leopard 



either made of wood or beads. 

The masks themselves may seem meaningless to the 
uneducated viewer, but no mask was created that didn't 
serve one purpose or another. 

Some of the of the masks were used in ceremonial rit- 
uals, a large pan of them captured the essence and power 
of various crafters thalthe people of Africa were familiar 
with A prime example of these would be a mask to honor 
a tiger. 

In having the tribal mask maker make a mask of a 
tiger, the person for whom the mask was intended would 
be attempting to call upon the spirit of a tiger to lend him 
the traits that make tigers formidable creatures: sleekness, 
speed, power, and audacity. 

The owner of the mask, upon its completion, would 
rarely remove the mask from his head and would in fact 
become the mask — embodying all that the mask repre- 
sented in the eyes of his fellow tribesman. 

In viewing the masks of the Han Coray collection, it 
is difficult to initially understand the purpose of the rep- 
resentation, but the more one lingers upon a mask, the 
more apparent the emotion surrounding it becomes. 

The original owners of the masks in the Han Coray 
collection believed a great deal in the power of tiger 
masks, a concept that was depicted by the omateness of 
their design. 

As if the 202 forms of art involved in the Han Coray 
collection were not enough .coupled with the an exhibit 
is a series of lectures, presentations, and performances 
that are designed to intensify the cultural richness of the 
African people. 

. Through slide shows, lectures, and even food presen- 
tations the Toledo Museum of Art attempts to bring the art 
of Africa to life for its patrons. 

These presentations and exhibitions arc all scheduled 
programs that are as informative as they are 
creative. 

Coray was not himself an artist but merely an an 
dealer. 

However through his work as a collector he managed 
to bring to life a culture that many believed was exter- 
minated by European colonization in the 19th century. 

His collection can't really be classified as being in the 
same category as European an, as it was created for 
"every day use," not for beauty or a release of self. 

However, Han Coray's collection has become world- 
renowned 24 years after his death for being one of the 
finest collections of African an in the world: this form of 
an influenced such great 20th-century anists as Picasso, 
Braque, Modigliani and the 
Zurich Dadaisias. 

To pass the opportunity to 
view these works would be 
passing a chance to view 
African history as it was in the 
19th Century.

Soul Asylum brings pre-Halloween bash to the Fort 




Gettin' close with Dave Pirner, lead singer of Soul Asylum 



hy Denise Kopulos 



Staff Writer 

After ten years of struggle and a three-year hiatus, 
however, the band Soul Asylum is finally back on the 
alternative scene. 

If you remember, Soul Asylum made it big with the 
muld-platinum album "Grave Dancers Union" back 
in 1992. 

The hit song "Runaway Train" was used for a pub- 
lic service announcement for runaway children and was 
broadcast through the nation. 

They even performed at President Clinton's inaugu- 
ration thai year. 

With eleven albums under their belt. Soul Asylum 



has proven their talent and deter- 
mination to make great music. 

Pierre's just recently 
installed a new sound system, 
and it had a loud, obnoxious clar- 
ity iti.ii defines Dave Pirner's 
vocal style. 

Thesc guys looked the same 
as they did Lack in 1992 with a 
classic flannel Seattle look. 

Most of Soul Asylum's hit 
songs that were popular in the 
1 80s and 90s were played in the 
first hour of the show, so anyone 
arriving late would have proba- 
bly missed the songs they went to 
hear. 

Everyone in the crowd. 
which was rather large, jumped 
and banged their heads to 
"Somebody to Shove," and 
everyone flicked their Dies for a 
nostalgic rendition of "Runaway 
Train." 

Soul Asylum hails from 
Minneapolis, where the band 
formed in 1984. 

Composed of singer Dave 
Pimer, guitarist Dan Murphy. 
bassist Karl Mueller, and drummer Sterling Campbell 
these guys have yielded a loyal fan base from all their 
years on college radio. 

Pimer has ouishined the rest of the band in notori- 
ety, because of his romantic link with Winona Ryder 
since 1994. 

Soul Asylum played an interesting combination of 
songs from their repertoire including several cover 
tunes which really surprised me. 

One of their numbers was a killer version of the 
new song by rapper Wyclef (of the Fugees). "Gone Till 
November." which is an extremely sad song that was 
beautifully performed with exceptional sound quality. 

Very intimate lighting was used during this song to 
symbolize the pain of being left alone for months at a 



The wonderful world of web-cams 



Staff Writer 

Remember when "The Truman Show" first came 
out last spring? Remember bow the media made the 
phrase "the real-life Truman Show" a cliche describing 
situations where people were exposed to the public, 
whether or not they knew they were? 

Well, sometimes they were talking about the web- 
cams that have been popping up everywhere on the 
Internet. 

The whole craze originally started at a university 
where someone came up with the idea to put a camera 
next to a coffee machine, so people would know if there 
was any coffee left. 

Since then, people have come up with other uses, 
the most popular being the "Jenni-Cam" approach, 
where their lives are exposed to anyone visiting their 
site. 

I decided to go searching for these; and when I 
found some, I had already discovered that parody sites 
had been set up to mock the camera craze. With this in 
mind, I have some cam sites for this week, and yes, 



http://www.Fallscam.com 

This web site has a cam atop Niagara Falls and 
updates the page every 10 seconds. If you need a picture 
of Niagara Falls, this would be a good place to get it 
using simple "copy and paste" techniques. 

Patience is a necessity for this site if your computer 
isn't running at 333 MHz and has less than a 56k con- 
nection to the internet On a fast computer, however, 
you'll be enjoying Niagara in no lime,

This web site has the dual title "Coffee Cam/Chia 
Cam." I was confused by the coffee cam; it just 
appeared to be a black screen with several white dots. 

However, the true genius came from the Chia-cam 
creator, it has a video of a "Cola-Prof" growing next to 
the coffee maker. It is sped up, so the "Chia-Prof" 



Works by Fort Wayne native to 
show with Adams exhibit 



In conjunction with the Ansel 
Adams exhibition, the Fort Wayne 
Museum of Art is proud to announce 
the photography of Sheldon Hine 
will be on display in the North 
Gallery. 

Sheldon Hlne: 75 Years 
Behind the Leas is a retrospective 
exhibition which will include over 
sixty images organized by the Fori 
Wayne Museum of An Curator of 
Collections, Robert Schroeder and 
Sacni Yanari-Rizzo, Associate 
Curator of Collections. 

Accompanying the exhibition 
will be a catalogue produced by the 
museum reflecting Hine's career. 

The catalogue will be approxi- 
mately 32 pages in length and will 
include an essay interpreting Hine's 
photographs, a timeline with impor- 
tant career dates, as well as black 
and white reproductions of 19 
images from the exhibition. Selling 
price for the catalogue will be S10 in 
the Museum Shop. 



After graduating from South 
Side High School in Fort Wayne. 
Hine began his career with Lincoln 
National Life Insurance Company 
as the art director. 

He documented the construction 
of Lincoln National's Harrison 
Street building and the installation 
of the Paul Manship sculpture 
Abraham Lincoln: The Hoosier 
Youth at the entrance to the building. 

During World War II. Hine initi- 
ated and supervised the Navy 
Research and Development Project 
known as the Photo Surface Model, 
which gave the United States a def- 
inite advantage in both the Pacific 
and European arenas. 

It was a technique of printing 
information and high-resolution aer- 
ial photography. Congress awarded 
the project the Congressional Medal 
of Honor. 

Over the years Hine's work has 
been accepted in exhibitions both in 
the United Stales and ■ 



time. 

The band also 
jammed on Alice 
Cooper's "School's 
Out" which was 
cool since I hadn't 
beard it in a long 
time. 

Tbe band's 
impromptu duel on 
vocals paired gui- 
tarist Dan Murphy 
and Dave Pirner, 
who blended 
together well. 

Hey, remember 
the 80s. when every 
concert from A to Z 
had a drum solo 
included as an 
essential instrumen- 
tal break in their 
show? 

Soul Asylum's 
drummer Sterling 
Campbell beat out a 
kind of mini-solo 
interlude, which I 
thought was very 
cool because it 
reminded me of the 
good old days when rock-n-roll was just simple, fun and 
not big business. 

"Candy From a Stranger," the tide song from their 
latest album, had a very funky-psychedelic wah-wah 
effect that was groovy and danceable. 

"Misery," which was a big bit in 1995, still seemed 
to be loved by the party-goers at Pierre's. 

Soul Asylum put on an excellent show overall; they 
were energetic, in-tune and all members were instru- 
mentally in synch. 

Their show Friday night had a successful 
i 1 1 r n ■ ■in.. ui J was a refreshing blast from the not-so-dis- 
tant past that is hopefully coming back. 



During his career be invented, 
developed and received over twelve 
patents on illumination systems, 
some still in use today.

http://www.bohush.com/concam.htm 

This web site has several different components: the 
Consultant Cam, the Frog Cam, and tbe Coma Cam. 
Each is unique in its own weird way. Allow me to break 
them down for you. 

Tbe Consultant Cam has a long explanation as to 
how it works, but all I've seen when 1 visit is a looping 
series of pictures with people in some sort of meeting. 1 
wonder if this is even supposed to be legitimate (espe- 
cially after taking a look at the other two cams). 

The idea behind the Frog Cam is simple. There is a 
camera focused on a dead frog preserved in formalde- 
hyde. 

It updates every 10 seconds, but I don't think there's 
any difference between the two pictures. But just when 
you thought this is as sick as it gets, there's the Coma 
Cam. 

The Coma Cam is by far the oddest of all. It really 
isn't a cam at all; it's more of a skit about someone who 
gets dumped, overdoses on medication, and slips into 
what we would assume to be a coma. 

I hope this is some sort of inside joke; otherwise, 
this author overtakes the "Inanimate Objects" author as 
most in need of psychiatric care. 

So there they are; 1 hope you enjoy them. I'd like to 
take this time to apologize to anyone who has ever been 
offended by my articles. 

However, the suggestion that I research what 1 write

most people are going to sec the site upon viewing il I 
still shouldn't have written what 1 did; and again I apol- 
ogize.

College football needs playoff system to decide who is #1 



by Matt Schwr 



Staff Writer 

While college football has the most 
exciting product in all of college sports, 
possibly including the pros, il bas the single 
worst format to determine the champion. 

Last week the BCS, Bowl 
Championship Series, released their first 
rankings for the innaugural season under 
the new formal 

Remove the word championship, and 
you have only BS, how fitting. 

The new formal is composed of the AP 
poll, the coaches poll, and two computer 
rankings. 

Will someone please give me a logical 
reason why we cannot have a playoff? 

College basketball has March Madness, 
and college baseball has its own World 
Series. College football is the only sport 
where the championship is not decided on 
the field. 

Last season, Michigan and Nebraska 
shared the tide. 

Many, including myself, felt thai 
Nebraska's share was a "going-away gift" 
for retiring coach Tom Osborne. 

The real travesty was that the fans were 
cheaied out of seeing ihe Michigan vs. 
Nebraska game for the championship, not 
to mention the players, who had 10 share the 
title. 

The obvious answer is a playoff sysiem 
which could still use the bowls as a forum 
yel still include the human element 
although on a much smaller scale. 

Before 1 start ripping the BCS, I will 
explain the system as well as 1 understand 
it. The goal of the BCS is to match the (op 
two teams in the country in a "champi- 
onship bowl" regardless of conference affil- 
iation. A nice concept, but not practical. 

Right now there are six undefeated 
teams in college football. 

Ohio State. Tennessee. UCLA and 
Kansas State which arc ranked accordingly, 
along with Wisconsin and Tulane, who have 
not earned the respect of the voiers. 

While the latter two are not in ihe same 
class as the top 4, they still could win the 
rest of their games and not get a shot at ihe 
championship. 

Meanwhile, none of the top 4 play each 
other, and all could win their remaining 



games yet two teams would not get the 
opportunity to play for the title, which is 
ridiculous. 

One of the chief complaints of the BCS 
is the format used to determine the 
rankings. 

The two polls are self-explanatory, the 
media votes for the AP poll, and the coach- 
es vote for the coaches poll. 

The rest of the equation is where ihe 
BCS gels confusing and criticized. 

Two computer rankings. The New York 
Times, and Seattle Times combine to give 



OSU if they falter in their remaining games. 

As long as OSU wins iheir games, whal 
their opponents do later on should be 
irrelevant. 

This system, while a joke, docs at least 
attempt to match the top teams in ihe 
country. 

I have beard several reasons that a play- 
off is not an alternative; they include: the 
bowl tradition, loo many games, and the 
student/athlete aspect which doesn't allow a 
playoff 

First I will dispel these myths, then out- 



an overall score for the remaining portion of line my plan for a sensible playoff system.

against an aver-

team, they 
dropped Iwo 
spots in the poll. 

They were 
actually penal- 
ized for not win- 
ning by enough. 

Note to gam- 
blers: lay the big 
number with 
these top teams 
against the aver- 
age and weaker 
opponents. 

Last week- 
end, Ohio State, 
Tennessee and 
Tulane all won 
big. The BCS 



be at the Toslitos Fiesta Bowl. 

There is no longer any 

bowl tradition, rather the 

bowls are advertising oppor- 

. , tunities auctioned off to the 

a playoff system would highest bidder. 

Since the old conference 



"The argument that 



mean too 

many games is a 

legitimate concern 

The answer: 

eliminate all 

non-conference 

games." 



ties are obsolete, the rest of 
the bowls have been rendered 
meaningless. 

If Ohio State and 
Tennessee meel in the Fiesta 
Bowl, what significance do 
any of the other bowls hold? 

Under the old sysiem if 
there was any doubt who was 
#1, at least one of the other 
major bowls played a part 
such as last season. Now only 
one game matters 

As exciting as college 
,^____ football is, it is the only sport 
that actually loses interest as 
the season winds down. 

A playoff system would guarantee the 
opposite. 

The argument thai a playoff sysiem 



The answer eliminate all non-confer- 



has unintentionally encouraged teams to run 
the score up. 

The olhcr problem is the emphasis put 
on opponents' strength of schedule. 

Teams can control who they schedule, would mean too many games is a legitimate 
and how they play, but not the scheduling 
and outcome of their opponents' other 
games. 

Because the Big Ten is having a down 
year, Ohio State could suffer in the BCS those other made for TV matchups that are 
rankings. usually blowouts anyway. 

Two of their non-conference games. Why any team under the current sys- 

West Virginia and Missouri were both tern would play in a game like ibis is 
ranked when they played OSU, but will hurt beyond me. If you lose, your title hopes are 




extinct. 

The only rea- 
son they do play 
is for ihe fat pay- 
checks that the 
universities gel. 
The players 
should get some 
cut, but lhat is a 
separate 
argument. 

If teams play 
only nine games, 
all against con- 
ference foes, and 
then a tenlh con- 
ference champi- 
onship game, we 
could have a fair 
representation of 
the besl teams 
from all over the 
country, 

Much like 
the bowl system, 
there is too much 
cash involved 
(corporate spon- 
sors) to eliminate 
the conference championship games, 

Now if we are to eliminate all of the 
pre-conference games, ihen we can finish 
ihe regular season by mid November, and 
hold all of the conference championship 
games during Thanksgiving weekend. 

Then there could be a one- or iwo-week 
gap until the playoffs begin in mid- 
December, just after finals are finished. 

The playoffs would continue through 
the holiday season and culminate wilh a 
true championship game on New Year's 
Day. 

Now my playoff system is not perfect, 
but it is much better than the current one, 
while using components of the current 
system. 

If you take the winners from all of the 
conference championship games; Big Ten, 
Big 12. Pac 10. ACC, Big East, and SEC. 
you have six teams although currently only 
three oul of these six have conference 
championship games. 

With an awkward number of teams for 
a playoff, two more teams are necessary for 
congruity. 

The remaining two teams would be at- 
large bids. 



Teams from the WAC or MAC or other 
conferences would still have a chance to 
compete, but would have to be undefeated 
to stand a chance. 

Which is okay because I can't remem- 
ber the last time either challenged for the 
title anyway. 

Much like the basketball tournament, 
some teams are still going to get cheaied. 

The two remaining at-large bids could 
be decided by an AP poll, coaches poll, and 
computer ranking using all of the same fac- 
tors as presenL 

The winners, along with the two at large 
bids, would then play lheir four first-round 
games at another bowl, again a neutral 
sighi 

This would leave us with football's ver- 
sion of the Final Four, 

Both semifinal games would be played 
ibe following week, on Christmas Eve and 
Christmas Day with the final game being 
played on New Years' Day. 

Along wilh simply making sense, this 
system would eliminate that annoying 
month in between ihe final game and the

Womens volleyball team to wrap up season against Parkside 

Seniors to be rewarded in last home game for 'star' effort 

"Siar leads through her play. 
She performs under pressure and 
rises to [he challenge," Hcffron 
said. "Katie gives us leadership 




Seniors Sar Trahin and Kalie boih mentally and physically. 



Senior Katie Breuning has had a very successful season 
here. She will play in her last home game this Saturday 



Bruening have had a remarkable 
volleyball career here at IPFW. 

"Iney have both done a fantas- 
tic job for us this season," Head 
Coach Tim Heflron said. "They 
have stepped up big in a leadership 
role I was not sure was going to be 
filled." 

Together they have achieved 
an impressive 23-6 record which 
puts them 12-2 in the Great Lakes 
Valley Conference. 

More impressive though is the 
fact thai the Dons have an opportu- 
nity to host the 
regional tournament. 

"Katie and Star 
are huge factors in our 
team's success this 
season," Heffron said. 
"They know what this 
team needs to do and 
where this team needs 
to go." 

Where is that you 
might ask? Well, 
hopefully in the Elite 
EighL "It will be an 
exciting tournament 
for us. The girls 
remember last year 
(an intense five-game 
loss in the regional 

finals) and want to 

improve upon that," 
Heffron said. 

The Dons have two home 
games remaining, one on Friday, 
Nov. 6 and the other on Saturday, 
Nov.7. 

Saturday will not only be a big 
match for the team, but it puts 
Trahin and Bruening in the lime 
light. 

Senior night will be special for 
the two. Trahin and Bruening both 
playing in their last regular season 
vulleyball game at IPFW. 



She knows the direction of where 
we want to go. Her leadership is 
contagious, and all of the players 
are having a lot of fun performing 
at a high level of play." 

Not only have Star and Katie 
been playing ai an extremely high 
level of play, but the entire team 
has also been playing extremely 
well. 

Laura Douglas is fifth in the 
GLVC in kills with 433 and third 
in the conference in Digs with 
403 in 106 games. 

A lot of her 
play is comple- 
mented by setter 
Tami Isch Isch 
has 1,285 assists, 
averaging 13 per 
game which

tournament for us.

improve upon that " 



Tim Heffron. 
Volleyball Coach 



Rachel Brown 
has also been 
playing well. 
Brown is fourth 
in the conference 
with a hitting per- 
centage of ,309. 

Trie team is 
coming off of 
three .big wins 

this p'ast week 

and will need 
three more wins this week to 
secure a conference title. 

The Dons are second in the 
conference for kills and fourth in 
assists. 

If there is an area to work on 
il would be serving. They are 
11th in the conference, only aver- 
aging 1.32 a game. 

"We don't have any easy games 
from here on. I am very confident 
in our team and excited to see how 
we do in the tournament," Heffron 




Tami Isch assists another one of her teammates. She
