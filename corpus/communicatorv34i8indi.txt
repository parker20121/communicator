Lugar: 'failure unthinkable' 



Concerning the wai 



to U.S. 



Senator Richard Lugar. 

"Failure... is unthinkable." 

Speaking to an audience at 
IPFW on Saturday, Oct. 18, the 
Indiana-based Senator traced both 
historical and current trends in the 
international arena. 

"It happens very seldom that 
we have an expert in international 
politics, as well as, local politics to 
speak with us," commented 
Chancellor Michael Wartell in his 
introductory remarks. 

Lugar, first elected in 1976, is 
now in his fifth term in office. He is 
the Chair of the influential Senate 
Relations Committee and a mem- 
ber of the Agriculture, Nutrition 
and Forestry Committee. 

The Senior Senator from 
Indiana raised eyebrows when he 



, critical of the cur- 
rent administration during his 
appearance on "Meet the Press" 
Sunday, Oct. 12. 

"I among others have criti- 
cized the lack of preparation for 
the day after the hostilities," Lugar 
observed during his speech. " It's 
not an original comment, but ... (it) 
lias a great deal of accuracy." 

"We take a viewpoint that in 
recent times, that if there are diffi- 
culties in which we much become 
involved, we fight the war ... and 
then we leave. And then we say to 
whomever is left we have rid you 
of the problem, and vou're on your 
own, do the best that you can."

American unilateralism.

Midnight 
Madness 



ByLucas Cubic 

and Scott M. Lawson 

The Communicator 

Perhaps it's just a sign of how 
obsessed the state of Indiana is 
with a little sport named basket- 
ball. 

Thousands attended a prac- 
tice, in the middle of the night, just 
to mark the fact that the season is 
beginning again. 

For the third year in a row 
Midnight Madness was another 
huge hit. 

It took place Friday night and 
into the wee hours of Saturday 
morning at IPFW Gates Center. Of 
course, it wasn't just a basketball 
practice, but a celebration of the 
upcoming season and the sport. , 

Prior to the practice, those 
attending were able to watch a bas- 
ketball game pitting IPFW celebri- 
ties and enjoy the antics of Baby

The Forgotten Holocaust 



On Monday, October 20, two 
victims of the Holocaust were in 
the Walb Ballroom telling their 
account of their horrifying past in 
concentration camps. 

These two men are different 
from the millions of other Jews, 
gypsies who were persecuted. 

They were American soldiers. 

Former P.O.W's Tony 
Acevedo and Norm Fellman of the 
275th Infantry Regiment spoke 
with an audience ranging from 
educators to students to those who 
simply wanted to understand their 
tragic. 

IPFW's Susan Alderman 
began the meeting with a viewing 
of 'Berga: Soldiers of Another War," 
a documentary by the late Charles 
Guggenheim. 

It featured the story of the 350 
American soldiers that were cap- 
tured during the Battle of the Bulge

Editorial 

Build it, and they will come? 

We have a philosophy of sorts at IPFW now. 

Infrastructure, and follow that with education. 

At least that's the way it appears. 

To be certain, every campus needs to grow, and we are growing both physically and 
in our academics - but right now there seems to be an emphasis on growth of buildings 
and bridges. 

Partly it is easier to see and understand physical groioth. It's a lot easier to cut a 
ribbon and hold a ceremony for a bridge than it is a new undergraduate program, but 
we should be careful not to build empty structures loithout a clue of what we want to 
fill them. 

We don't hear enough about what programs IPFW hopes to offer in the future. We 
hear we're going to have a new dorm, maybe a new pedestrian bridge over the river, per- 
haps a few more buildings for a few current programs. But not much on new majors the 
university is hoping to incorporate into our campus. 

We think if we have enough buildings and look enough like IU or Purdue, kids will 
want to come here and returning students might want to come back. But in the imme- 
diate future, IPFW can't compare with the college life of IU or Purdue. Most people 
come to IPFW out of convenience of location. It's close to many hometoions. The other 
reason people are supposed to choose a school is for its academic programs. We're using 
the "Field of Dreams" hope of "build it and students will come." That shouldn't be our 
hope. Our hope should be: have the academics, and they will want to come here to learn.

Letters to the Editor 

IPFW needs centralized food area 



As a graduating senior this semester, I 
feel as though I have seen this campus trans- 
form in the years I have been here. So many 
good things have come to the campus in such 
a short period of time. 

From the renovations of buildings to 
the new bridge and dorms, it is easy to see 
that IPFW will become a huge landmark for 
Fort Wayne. 

Speaking from a student's point of 
view, one major improvement that will be 
needed soon is the addition of more food 
vendors. With the new dorms, students will 
need more than just two Subways and a 
Pizza Hut to choose from. 

A feasibility study needs to be done on 
adding something like a large food court for 
students to gather for breakfast, lunch and 
dinner. It needs to be in a central point on 
campus ... not at Walb (where no one is). It 



would be nice to see a building put up on the 
patch of grass in between Kettler and 
Classroom Medical (which used to be a fac- 
ulty parking lot). 

All of this makes sense. It will make 
students happy, and it will bring more 
money onto the campus. 

Ball State recently built a food court, 
"The Atrium," inside the new Art and 
Journalism Building, which opened in the 
Fall of 2001. It has five restaurants: a made- 
to-order Asian food establishment, Chick-fil- 
A, McKinley Grille, Sbarro, the Italian Eatery 
and Block &amp; Barrel Deli. 

Wow ... something more than Subway 
or Pizza Hut ... maybe someday!

TV:Move to Mayberry 



Column 



/ recently read that children aspire to be wlmt they 
view on television. If they watch the doctor and lawyer 
shows fine, but what if the)/ watch all of the "other stuff' 
on TV? 

Let 's see . . . my eldest daughter could become Miss 
America and receive a scholarship for her education based 
on her brains, beauty and poise. Or she could be picked 
to be one of the women vying for a man masquerading as 
a millionnaire. They could follow her around on her 
"dates " with the liar straight to the hotel or hot tub as he 
plays his dates off each other until he decides she is the 
"best" for him. (Whatever he wants her to be "best" in, 
that is.) Then will she stay ivith the man, who was not 
the man she thought, in order to find true happiness 
Even if the shozo gives the pauper some money? Then 
she could get married on a spin-off shoio, Imve a honey- 
moon on another station and even have a baby on 
Discovery Channel. 

My son could go into drug dealing so he could have 
his fifteen minutes of fame being hunted down and 
arrested on reality TV. Or maybe he and his girlfriend 
could cheat on each other and see if they finally find their 
'.dive "Miss and Mr. Right" ivith other couples' 
"significant others. " On the other Imnd, he has always 
wanted to be a "personality," so. maybe he .could getjiis 
own talk show and expose others daily for the ''tabloid 
trash " they really are. I'm sure the show would be in the 
top ten according to Neilsen. 

My youngest daughter would probably want to hang 
in a box miles in the air because she's afraid of heights 
But I think she would really eat 50 cockroaches, if the 
money zoas right. She's always wanted to go to a tropi- 
cal paradise and then "rough it" with a group of diverse 
individuals in order to stab others in the back and then 
win the game. After all being a daredevil or facing your 
fear is something everyone wants to do when they, "grow 
up. " 

Where did the "good ol' days" of entertaining, vari- 
ety shows or -wholesome shows go? That's right, they're 
on Nickelodeon. For those of us, who went to the movie 
theaters when John Wayne and Elizabeth Taylor were 
projected on screen, thank heaven for Turner Classic 
Movies. Once there were heroes and heroines whose sto- 
ries inspired rather than shows that expose and titillate. 

Have you become what you vieiu on tire tube? Or, if 
you have children, Imve they become a product of their 
viewing? 

As for me, I always lived my life as Lucy and look 
forward to moving to Mayberry.

want us to know, Acevedo 
believes. 

In order to be sent home, 
Tony Acevedo was forced to sign a 
document issued by the US gov- 
ernment that stated that he could 
not speak about what happened to 
him, because it would be detri- 
mental to the war still going on in 

"Personally I thought it was a 
load of bunk," Norm Fellman said. 
"I couldn't believe that people 
weren't allowed to know what 
happened to me, it was as if it did- 
n't even happen." 

The reason for the silencing 
was due to the cold war status in 
Germany, which made the need to 
make West Germany an ally after 
the events of WW II. 

If someone brought up Berga, 
then that was like making an ally 
upset. Government banning or 
not, their story eventually got out, 
even if it is 50 years later. And 
however long its been, the P.O.W's

When asked by the audience, 
Fellman spoke of the somber 
effects his time at the camps has 
left on him. 

"If someone approaches me 
with that question and they just 
have a minute, I'll say hello and 
tell them I'm fine. But if they have 
an hour and a half, I'll tell them 
what's really wrong with me." 

Acevedo agreed and went on 
to say that among their many set- 
backs, they have restrictions of 
blood due to cold weather injuries, 
loss of balance with eyes shut, 
arthritic tendencies due to beat- 
ings, and Post Traumatic Stress 

"But since this all came up a 
year after I left, the government 
refused to believe that they were a 
result of my stay at Berga." 

When one audience member 
asked if there was ever doubt if 
they would survive, Fellman gave 
an answer that showed their deter-

Both men agree that a memo- 
rial in Germany at the sight of the 
Berga camp sites would be "empty 
gesture" since many of those who 
put them through so much pain 
are no longer around. Although 
painful, the men hope that by 
showing what horrible things one 
human being can do to another 
human being, similar acts of hate 
will be avoided.

The Senator further illustrated 
the expanse of the Iraqi war dilem- 

"It's an extremely complex 
problem and I don't mean to be 
hypercritical, I would just say that 
the war ended faster than anybody 
thought ... even though we did 
begin to get some plan for how it

Yet the prospect of an extend-

the Senator. "To leave an incubator

"We still have some work cut

The Senator prefaced his com- 
ments on Iraq with a description of 
the pre- and post- 9/11 world. 

Before Sept. 11, 2001, there 
was an American strength. 

"By most standards the United 
States not only was the dominant 
military power in the world, like- 
wise it was perceived as the 
strongest economic(ally)," he said. 

This dominance created "not 
... a sense of imperialism, or a feel- 
ing that we ought to dominate the 
affairs of the world, but rather 
what I would characterize in that 
period as a mood of semi-isolation- 
ism and protectionism," according 
to the Senator. 

In fact, Lugar characterized 
the pre-Sept. 11 world as "anti- 
imperialist" and against foreign 
occupation. "We do not like to 
leave (soldiers] somewhere else, 
we like to bring them home," he 
further elaborated. 

"The dilemma of 9-11 was 
that the AI-Qaeda or whoever pro- 
vided the young suicide bombers 
... fought their war here - in the 
United States," he said.

Gates Center: Not just for the athletes 



By Brian Gaines 
The Communicator 

The Hilliard Gates Sports 
Center, an untapped resource locat- 
ed on IPFW's campus near the 
Walb Student Union, offers stu- 
dents a chance to get in shape and 
get away from the stress of college 
academics. 

Unfortunately, many students 
are unaware that the use of the 
Gates Center is free for currently- 
enrolled IPFW students. Jamie 
Wilson, a junior at IPFW, is one 
such student. 

"I have often considered 
working out at Gates after class," 
Wilson said, "but I never knew it 

The Gates Center is a com- 
plete workout center which houses 
facilities for the strength training 
and conditioning of Division 1 ath- 



letes. Hence, it has everything a 
person who is serious about physi- 
cal fitness needs. 

The strength training room 

containsa 15 piece Nautilus weight 
set as well as a complete set of free 
weights. Attached to the strength 
room is a wooden floor for aerobics 
and dance classes, 

The conditioning room has a 
wide variety of cardiovascular 
equipment. The cardio equipment 
includes five treadmills, ten bikes, 
five Elliptical EFX Cross Trainers, 
five Stairmasters and two rowing 
machines. Gates also houses three 
basketball/volleyball courts, five 
racquetball/handball courts and a 
1/9 mile indoor track. 

"There are hundreds of bene- 
fits for being active," said Judy 
Tillapaugh, the Wellness and 
Fitness Coordinator a't IPFW. "It is 
so much more than burning calo-

Not many IPFW students know of the school's athletic facility.

By working out, students are 
doing more than just getting in 
shape. The Gates Center offers a 
place for students to connect with 
not only other students but faculty 

Additionally, as Tillapaugh 
noted, working out also has sever- 
al social benefits which include 
self-esteem improvement, depres-' 
sion prevention, and stress red tic- 

Students can often use the 
Gates Center as an escape from the

"I work out at Gates everyday 
after class," said Brad Gehring, an 
IPFW sophomore. "It's exactly 
what I need to get away after a 
long day of college." 

Besides providing fitness 
facilities, the Gates Center also 
offers various programs and class- 
es. It has three personal trainers 
who can be hired for hour long ses- 



sions to provide individualized 
attention. Those interested can 
lake advantage of a tree orientation 
and "Getting Started Guidelines," 
which is a one-on-one consultation 
to establish a person's fitness goals. 
After a person's goals are in 
place, il is the goal of the personal 
trainer to help the individual reach 
their goals. The recommended 
package for a person getting start- 
ed is three sessions for $80, while 
two other packages are available as 

Fitness classes are also avail- 
able at Gates through the 
Continuing Education program. 
Fitness classes range from yoga to 
conditioning and encompass all fit- 
ness levels.

Hilliard Gales Sports Center and 
the many services it provides, call 
the Gates Center service desk at 
481-6655 or contact Judy 
Tilllapaugh by phone at 481-6647 



Purdue at Michigan. This 
is the most important Big Ten 
matchup of the season thus far. 
Both teams are playing with exteme 
confidence. Boilermaker Kyle 
Orton threw for Over 400 yards last 
weekend while Wolverine Chris 
Perry ran for over 150 in just 2 quar- 
ters, Vegas says its an even 
matchup. Masto says Michigan has 
the edge in The Big House, 
Prediction: Meeechigan. 

Auburn at LSU. I love 
these dirrrrrrry south games. But 
not as much as I love to write the 
word dirty with about 8 r's. To 
football, LSU gets it done. Nothing 
too flashy, just solid performances 
all-around. On Auburn's side, the 
Cadillac (Williams) is in 5th gear 
and running wild. 6 TD's last 
weekend against Mississippi State is 
sick. The scary part: Williams' 161 
yards were only 1/3 of the team's 
rushing total. Prediction: Auburn. 

Northern Illinois at 
Bowling Green. What?! The 
MAC?! Yea, baby. These two 
teams are the faces of the MAC 
attack sweeping college football this 
season. This is a huge showdown 
for running stud Michael "Burner" 
Turner and his undefeated Huskies 
of NI, but no way can Bowling 
Green stop him. Prediction: 
Northern Illinois. 

Oregon State at 

Washington State. Steven Jackson 
and the inability to beat Notre 
Dame are the only two reasons why 
I am picking against the Cougars. 
Prediction: Oregon State. 

Masto Mullet is 20-6.

i Layto 



As a child I was told that my 
greatest weakness was taking every- 
thing for granted. At age 9 I : 

found out what that meant. 

I started my fourth grade year 
like every other nonnal child. I had 
friends and teachers and had learned 
the real value of a penny. 

My friends and I would take 
turns playing sick during the I ngh-.ii 
lesson. It was so easy to slip that 
penny right underneath my tongue 
and pretend that 1 had an abnormal 
temperature during English. Then 1 
got caught and wasn't believed very 

Well one day while I sat in my 
English class no doubt, I complained 
to the teacher about having blurry- 
vision. After the class she finally let 
me see the nurse who then called my 

My mother said to wail until alter 
school when she'd talk to me. 
Needless to say the questions and 
accusations came pouring out. After 
about an hour she called Lens 
Crafters and threatened me with 

Within the time frame of a day, 
our whole family went to Lens 
Crafters for an annual check up so as 
not to have wasted a trip. My parents 
got their prescriptions renewed, my 
sister got a nice pair of glasses anil I 
got a trip to Riley's 
Children Hospital. 
To make a much 
longer story short, 
the doctors diag- 
nosed me with a 
disease called

For those of you who have . ,

eyer been placed mi a steroid, you y, nvjir 
will know that they are extremely 
unpleasant. The side effects caused 
me a lot of physical and emotional 
changes. I gained over 50 pounds 
within the firsl six months, and as a 
fifth grader I was the hutt of all 

I heard the blind jokes, the dumb 
jokes, and the fat jokes and names 



learned Braille and 
how to use a walking stick, I can hon- 
estly say that I am ready to go per- 
manently blind if the worst case sce- 
nario occurs. My high school guid- 
ance counselors were always telling 
me how brave I was and how strong 
I had to be, to have been going 
through all ol this. It was as though 
they thought I had a choice. 

I've lost my vision periodicalK 



during my life Doctors have miracu- 
lously saved me time and again and 
have become like my second family. 
The many hospitals have become my 
second home. 

There are times now, when I feel 
slressed, that my eyes will occasion- 
ally black out for a minute, but I've 
learned to except certain flaws that I 

I've also learned not to take any 
thing for granted. ! sometimes find 
myself looking at the sky for no rea- 
son whatsoever, or gazing at the stars 
for hours on end. I never bought a 
telescope though. It never seemed 
sensible. I've never even had the 
chance to look through one, and it's 
one of my biggest regrets. 

Although my doctors have saved 
my sight so far, there are always 
going to be the 'what if questions in 
the back of my head. "What if 1 never 
get to see the moon again?" "What if 
! never get to see a foreign country?" 
"What if this is the last day I'll see the 
color blue, or any color for that mat- 
ter?" "And if 1 could only have one 
thing to remember by tomorrow that 
would be engraved in my mind for- 
ever, what would it be?" 

I'm not going to lie to all of you, I 
am scared, but not of the shots. Not 
because of the name-calling or jokes 
Not because this might be the last 
time I write on lined paper, and not 
because I might go blind. 

My greatest fear has been and 
always will be the uncertainty'. What 
will I be dmng when it happens? Will 
I be sale in bed or on a high platform, 
or driving, a car? Will I remain calm 
or make a fool out of myself in a 
crowd? What will I miss the most? I 
guess I can't take anything for grant-

Much of the event was 
sponsored by Student 
Activities Board, and IPFW 
Athletic Director Mark Pope 

about how one IPFW stu- 
dent will win a new vehicle 
at the end of the basketball 
season -- if they qualify 
through attending basketball 
and volleyball games, 

With performances by 
Project Playground and kick- 
ing off the season practice 
opener, a huge crowd came 
out to support the men and 
women's basketball teams. 

Also included were bas- 
ketball-unique contests, like 
contestants attempting to 
score a shot while hopping 
in a sack and a student slam 

The men started prac- 
tice the day after Midnight 
Madness. They will be prac- 
ticing six days a week. 

During the practices 
they will be doing some 
drills of five on five basket- 
ball, practicing different 
plays, and working on basic 
skills for the upcoming sea- 

The men come off a sea- 
son of 9-21; however, they 
did manage to win seven of 
their last thirteen games

and promising hope for this 
year. IPFW Coach Doug 



Noll is looking forward to 
his fifth year coaching and is 
ready for a promising sea- 

"We added some new 
freshmen this year, which 
will give us a little bit more 
depth into the bench," Noll 

ready for its first exhibition 
game against the interna- 
tionally known Harlem 
Globetrotters on Nov, 13. 
After coming off an exciting 
night of the Midnight 
Madness, the players are 
ready to go to work. 

"This sets the tone fpr 
our season," sophomore for- 
ward Kyle Thrasher said. 

"This helps us build 
team chemistry," said assis- 
tant coach Prentis Phillips. 

"It gives our players a 
taste of what the season 
looks like, and lets the com- 
munity take a look at the 
basketball program here at 
IPFW," Phillips added. 

The men's basketball 
team is getting ready to go 
for what looks like a promis- 
ing season. 

With practicing six days 
a week the team is getting 
ready for the season opener - 
- which is also IPFW 
Homecoming -- against 
Toledo on November 21 
when Dick Vitale will be at 
the game.
