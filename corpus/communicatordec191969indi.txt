New Senators 
Speak Out 

Why do atudenls join [he Stu-

perience, money? Three new stu- 
donls Bnswerd this qustion. 

Chuck Rossraan, a freshman 
planning to major in earth sci- 
ence, says he ivanled to join stu- 
dent sovernment "to see what it 
was all about" 1 tvant to help out 
any way I can to help the student 
hody. A lot of people don't know 
it, but ihcrc are a lot of things 
going on around them. I would 
like to see paid parking be de- 
fealed and lo Pollution Teach-in 
on April 22 be suc4:essful. 

Ken Scheihenberger, an l.U. 
polilical science major in his jun- 
ior year, staled that he became 
interested in student government 
to "become more involved in ac- 
tivities on campus and see what 
things are going on." 

Steve Katt, an l.U. sophomore 
majoring in sociology, reported 
that he "wanted to become in- 
volved. 1 don't think most people 
care. This is a transitional cam- 
pus. As it expands, there ivill be 
more activities to become involved 
in. Most of the students don't 
realize this." 




On the job are three new members of student government; 
Chuck Rossman, Ken Scheibenberger and Steve Ka».

Nader Speaks On 
Consumer Safety 



On the surface, Ralph Nader 
appears lo be a very quiet, re- 
served individual. He doesn't seem 
to be tlic kind of person who 
would shake up a corporation as 
big as General Motors. Bui, be- 
cause of the poiirer of law, Ralph 
Nader has become a modern cru- 
sader. His crusade deab is-ith con- 
sumer safety, or rather Ihe lack 
of it. 

During a recent visit at our 
campus, Mr. Nader spoke upon 
the subject of consumer safety. 

Through the first part of his 
lecture, he emphasized tlie failtlre 
of educational systems to stress 
consumer safety. He feels that 
modern educational systems are 
simply teaching old ideas, and 
are afraid to try new ones. Fol- 
lowing this, he feels that if we 
follow only old ideas, we ^von'l 
be able to properly solve the 
problems ive are faced with. Ap- 
plying this lo consumer safety, 
Mr. Nader spoke of the ivays in 
which automobile safety has been 
promoted. The builders of auto- 
mobiles were forced to develop 
new parts for cars, and in order 
lo make these new parts, new ways 
of engineering and new concepts 
bad to be used. 

Mr. Nader feels that we are- 
failing Id meet the needs of the 
people in other fields also. In 
medicine, for example, doctors are 
trained only to deal with old 



diseases, instead of trying to pre- 

pollution, hospital, law enforce- 
ment, and meat packing, Mr. Na- 
der feels little is being done to 
prevent the public from being 
cheated. 

In 1965, Mr. Nader's book 
"Unsafe at Any Speed" was pub- 
lished. The book dealt widi the 
inherent lack of safely which Vias 
being, and still is being built 
to automobiles. 

Mr. Nader's book brought 
bout strong public disfavor 
unsafe automobiles, and as a 
suit of his attack on automobiles, 
automobile m'anufaclurers have 
been forced lo provide safer 

He recently audent Senate approves a con- 
litution, which always includes a 
ilause requiring the election of 
officers, it assumes that the con- 
stitution will be followed. That 
organization also accepts the re- 
sponsibility of abiding by the 
rules of the organizational hand- 

n. substantial percentage of 
chartered organizations are not 
filing officers with anybody. No 
enforcement of lUniversity regula- 
tions has been attempted. We, in 
itlernpt to clarify what organiza- 
ions do eiist, are going to assume 
hat if the organizations in ques. 
ion haven't turned in a list of 
officers, then they haven't elected 
any. If this is true, diey are violat- 
ing their constitutions. 

Aa the body elected to serve 
the students, it is our duty to be 
able to inform questioning stu- 
dents as to which organizations 
are active and which are not. I 
apologize for any misunderstand- 
^— involved. 

TTiank you.

LETTER TO EDITOR 

Mastodons, Ma.stodons, Maslo- 
done? What the heck is a Masto- 
don? And why has Pettyjohn been 
yelling "Go you tuskers" in the 
halls all week? There's that rumor 
of a petition supporting Masto- 
dons, or tuskers or something for 
school nickname. What the heck 
is a Mastodon? 

A Mastodon is or, rather 
a large elephant-like animal that 
lived during the Ice Age. It be- 
came extinct about 8,000 yeoi 
ago. A Mastodon was nine to te 
feet tall with idirec to four fci 
long tuaks and long reddish brown 
hair. So what? Why should Mi 
todons be our school nicknai 
or what have you? Anyivay, 
sounds different, strange, and cv 
ickcy (as one female student put 

That's exacHy why. It's different 
nnd. yes, even strange, I'm tired of 
slavishley copying what Blooming- 
ton. West Lafayette, and other 
■ ' schools do. And I'm tired of 
i high school altitudes nnd 
high school nicknames like Mus- 
_s. Marauders, War Hawks, el. 
al. For God's Sakes, lets have the 
courage to be a Utde different. 

mastodon was a big, strong, 
courageous, and tolerant animal, 
who let other animals take advan- 
tage of him, something like the 
;nls. Mastodons didn't get up- 
tight about too many things — ex- 
nt Mastodons of the opposite 
(—something like tlie lU-PU 
idents. Mastodons did have one 
bad habit; ihey had a tendency 
gel stuck in the mud. Need I 

Also, think of the possibilities 

id ramifications of using Ma.sIo- 

ms for a nickname. We'll be the 

ily school in the world called 

the Mastodons. The geology people 

ire going to put the Mastodon 

ikcleton that they found in the 

lobby BO we'll be the only school 

a mascot that's been dead for 

10.000 years fgive or lake a cen- 

tury). And think oE the cheers, 

"Go you tuskers; Yea M 

Tuskers; Go your hairy b- ; 

Stick it to 'em Mastodons," and 
' possibilities. Think of the 
newspaper headlines after we win 
game, "Mastodons win by a 
5e." We could save a lot of 
money by dressing our alhlettc 
ms (and marching band) in 
imal furs instead of uniforms. 
Tor a half-time show, we could 
tier Mastodon bones all over 
the playing field, then let the 
geologj- people assemble it while 
band plays the "Baby Ele- 
phant Walk." 



A Conservative Estimate 



by Dan Sliicltey 

President Nixon hos served the 

whims of governmental liberals 

once again. He hos implemented 

the lottery system. This program, 

which received support from such 

people as Senator Ted Kennedy 

and Governor Nelson Rockefeller, 

clever trick by the Nixon ad- 

stralion. He has convinced 

many that this system removes 

c inequities from the current 

stem. Upon investigation one 

ill notice that the inequities arc 

ill there, they have just been 

vcn a different name. 

Tile re are two major gripes 

against the lottery. 1) Tlie lottery 

an impersonal ineans of selec- 

I. In the lottery a janitor and 

uclear physicist have the same 



chance at being selecled to sen'e. 
2) The lottery will hurt military 
morale. As cartoonist Bill Mauldin 
put it: "I rather hate to think of 
any army that is made up largely 
of men who consider themselves 
losers in a monumental crap 

Wliot was Nixon's alternative? 
He could have begun the transi- 
tion to a voluntary military. The 
voluntary military which has the 
support of such men as Barry 
Goldwater and Phil Crane, has 
been proven to be a very feasible 
system. It is also moat consistent 
with the values of democracy. 
Doesn't a free society have the 
riglit to choose whether be wants 
to serve his country? 
NOTE: I came up a winner in 
the crap game. No. 274. 



Would it be a relevant name? 

Mastodons used to roam all over 
northern Indiana. They're as much 
a part of our area's history as 
Johnny Applesccd, Litde TurUe, 
and Anthony Wayne. So why dis- 
criminate - against Mastodons. 
Everybody else is remembered in 
Fort Wayne folklore except the 
Mastodon, Let's rectify this wrong. 
Mastodon, it's no worse (and a 
lot better) than other school 
names. After all, would somebody 
explain what a Hoosier or a 
Boilermaker is? A Razorback 
(Arkansas) is nothing but u wild 
pig and a Longhorn (Tcvaal is 
nothing but a skinny cow with 
horns. Some schools are called 
Trojans: those guys were nothing 
but big losers. At least the Mas- 
todon managed to survive for a 
few 100,000 years or so. He had 
ily to survive, something 



mid I 



. lea 



thing ugly about the 
Maslodon's appearance. In fact, 
the paintings I've seen show him 
to he quite a noble looking ani- 
mal (at least tliey e.\ude brute 
strength and great power). 

So why not Mastodons for a 
school nickname? Let's be dif- 
ferent and outstanding. fU-PU 
Mastodons. Go you Tuskers, go!

THE COMMUNICATOR 



'30' Minutes: 



Riverhavcn is a city, but no Yellow 
Brick Road leads to it. A dust}- stone 
road alone the Maumee River does. The 
homes tliere are nol made of ieweh and 
sapphires. Rusly nails, splintered paint, 
and leaky roofs mostly. The only sparkling 
gems arc llie children. It is »-ith them 
that Hcadstart hcgina and ends. Head.'lart 
Is children. Heodstart is love. 

About two hundred yards from a 
sleeping river, the Hcadstart center stands. 
But (his is a river subject to violent nrou- 
sals after a rain storm, or spring's nielling 
snows. The Center waits like a lifeboat 
against the floods and a lifeboat against 
poverty. 

The children of the Riverhaven area 
have the same need? and the same range 
of personalities as children everyivhere. 
But a special kind of problem brings 
tears to streak their cheeks and turns 
the volume of ihcir voices into almost, and 
aoraetiraea, silence. A strange kind of frus- 
tration smothers their curiosity, smothers 
self-identity, and grows loneliness in their 

Driving through the Riverhaven area 
the problem of these children seems hard 
lo grab with the mind. Your heart, though, 
gets a feeling if ynu tune so that it can 
see, hear, taste, and touch the emotions 
of people that seem carried on the wind. 
Soon the mind stirs, and in a moment 
whispers you understand. 

The Riverhaven area is an environment 
meager in stimulation, and often damag- 
ing in terms of emotional well-i&gt;eing. 
Poverty brings pain, not as quickly as a 
doctor's needle, but over a period of 

The children I had a chance to meet 
were varied in personalities. Some grew 
in poverty as if it were a rich soil; by 
far the majority didn't. They tended to do 
poorly in language as a general rule and 
had small vocabularies. Some ivere afraid 
to speak in the Hcadstart clnsses, while 
others were unable to. They sometime^ 
didn't know the names of things, and 
Mark, a five year old boy, scenieij not 
to know that things have nnnics 

To meet a boy like Mark is to be 
caught between a desire to reach him and 
anger at not knowing how. Where do 
you start when you want to bring laugh- 
ter back into a little boy's face? One can 
paint over a badly painted house, but 
poverty is not as easily painted over. A 
button can be sewn back on a dress in 
little lime, hut helping a child find his 
place in the world can't be done so 
(juickly. 

Louise Sanders, who serves as Head- 
start instructor tor the daily afternoon 
classes, knows where all help begins. It 
all begins with love. 

With her experience has come much in- 
iighlinlo these children. Speaking with her, 
1 learned that some children feel 



The Office of Economic Opportunity 

was established by federal law, 1964. 

This is a report filed by 

Darrell Parnin on one of it's agencies. 

An agency called Hcadstart 



of who they are. Quite a few of these kids 
have never worked with pencils, paper, 
crayons, scissors, puzzles, blocks, or hooks; 
and frequently they don't know how lo 
u=e ihem in play. And these are children 
4 to 5 years of age. 

But a disadvantaged child is not al- 
ways this way. Some arc like the spring 
morning when dew drips off the leaves 
as the sun's rays slip through the trees. 
Lisa, one of these children, comes to the 
center cloaked in a rainbow. The children 



loving. They arc mischievious. They are 
children. 

Although these children have a range 
of personalities, the aims and expecta- 
tions are the same for all. By bruiging 12 
to 15 kids togetlier for each class, Head- 
start attempts to help children learn lo 
work and play independently, at ease about 
being away from home, and able to accept 
help and direction from adults. 

Education for them has one challeng- 
ing goal to reach, to bring these children 
up to the level that more fortunate ones 
normally reach. The children learn to live 
and play with other children, and to value 
one's own rights and the rights of others. 
They learn to develop self-identity and a 
view of themselves as having competence 
and worth. To realize many opportunities 
to strive and lo succeed — physically, in- 
tellectually, and socially. To sharpen and 
widen language skills, using large and 
small muscles. To grow in ability to ex- 
press inner, creative impulses — dancing, 
making up songs, making up games, paint- 
ing, and handicrofts. 

To be a teacher in Hcadstart, Louise 
Sanders and volunteer workers teach. 
Teach what they know and teach what 
they are. Working toward her leaching de- 
gree, MisB Sanders is a student at the In- 
diana-Purdue Campus. But her work in 
Hcadstart, she already teaches everything 
children want to know about and are be- 
coming, and leaches in a way they un- 
derstand. 

The general aims of teaching have 
been discussed above. But when you are 
walled in by a leasing river and land fill 
projecLa, how do you approach these goals? 

The start begins with a program di- 
vided into four aspects. Disadvantaged 
children arc noticeably behind in lang- 



uage, and so work begins by establii-hLng a 
friendship wiili each child, and gradually 
gaining their trust and the watch of their 
eyes. Everyday the teacher seizes indi- 
vidual moments for one-to-one conversa' 
tion with each child. When a class has a 
large number of children, the volunteers 
search out with smiles, songs, and laugh- 
ter to reach them. 

A toy telephone can be talked to by 
almost all kids,. HeadBtart replaces the 
telephone with people. It replaces the laugh 
a hand puppet brings ivilh the laugh ano- 
ther human being brings. 

To develop language skills, word 
games are played, with each child's name, 
colors, and cartoon characters. But most 
important, this is done as group activity. 

Of all the activities, the dress up cor- 
ner where boys become cowboys and 
hunters and husbands, and little girls be- 
come housewives, cooking food and baking 
chocolate cakes, stimulates conversation. 
Bui popping corn, making apple sauce, 
building imaginary forts from boards, 
and taking care of pets, rates just as high 
in getting them lo come out of themselves. 

But words sometimes come so easily 
in writing that a problem seems not a 
problem. Bringing children out of their 
walled in silence is not so easy. Tell a 
child you can't hear him, tell him to be 
quiet, ond in a wrong moment he'll turn 
the (vorld off. 

As the children gradually come lo 
enjoy each others' friendship, as they 
gradually come to talk and trust the 
teachers and volunteers, field trips into 
a world many have never seen can be 
taken. Riding escalators and elevati 



walking 


in w 


oded areas where 


rrre 


limhs 


poke at 


r-loth 


ng in fun, and vis 






;iaus a 


t;ie 


nbrook: these are 


Ihe 


field 


trips. 












id aspect which He ad start 
zeros m on is curiosity. Children who pull 
into the back of the class are like this. 
A question never comes from their mouths, 
and they lack confidence in their ability 
to accomplish tilings. 

The only way to tap their confidence 
on the shoulder and get it turned around 
is by watching the child. Watching his 
hands. Watching his eyes. Trying to won- 
der as he wonders, and see the world 
through his senses. But wondering is not 
enough, you have to reach out. And the 




reaching is done in a gamt 
fashion. 

Fish swimming in a lank, different 
sized boxes or bags filled with something 
— children guess what is inside, moulding 
clay in different forms, these all help. 
But Ihe best things, are things that whirr, 
pop. and flash. Blinking lights, a puppy 
dog's fur, and a vibrating motor all seem 
to slip right to ihe center of a child's 
attention. 

The ihird aspect is lo build a child's 
self-image. And it all comes through re- 
flections, reflections from the teacher's 
eyes. The teacher and volunteer fashion 
selMmagc by a look, a touch, and a 
smile filled with the look of love. 

The final aspect deals ivith discipline. 
Children who grow up in deprived back- 
grounds sometimes have difficulties irilh 
authority figures. They rebel against what 
the teacher expects, and at first appear 
callous and unruly. But ivilh time they 
accept ihc class discipline that the teacher 
hopes to foster. 

Being kids, though, they will t^cream, 
kick, and drop things. Words arc often 
'nsufficient in these situations. The teacher 
jses them along with ihe most under- 
ilanding language of all — ^"body lan- 
guage." With a hug, a tencing-in with the 
arms, a standing nearby, a lift into the 
lap, or a grabbing of the hands, tbe 
child is directly reached. 

Bui Hcadstart is more than I've been 
able lo go into. It's also a Santa Claus 
ivilh good health for all. Children in poor 
hcallh function at a considerably lower 
!l then healthy children. Poverty and 
poor health seem to walk hand in hand 
path to nowheres. So Hcadstart pro- 
vides free, complete medical examinations, 
testing eyes, ears, and providing various 
immunizations. Dental exams are given at 
Ihe Dental Hygiene Clinic here on campus. 
And all of it is followed up with periodic 

The children I met were on their way 
up, up and out of poverty. Their hearts, 
1 think, ivill always shake hands in friend- 
ship with the teachers and volunteers. To 
hem a Charlie Brown Christmas is a 
year round feeling.

Mitchell Speaks 

Reform and the Farm 



Sacinly is constantly chaagine. 
It is changing becQUse of a need 
to chanee. Throueliout tlie yeare, 
man is what has caused the change 
in his society. 

In our f^ociety todoy. wc are 
forced into many problems. And 
when we want to bdIvu the prob- 
lem, we do what wc feci is ncccs- 
«ary. Henry L. Mitchell, a very 
prominent labor organizer in the 
30's, feels tl)Bl protest is the best 
way to change what is tvrong witli 
society. In a speech to students 
and faculty here on December 10, 
Mr. Mitchell spoke on the subject 
of protest. His lecture dealt with 
protest a? a means of social change 
and tile ways in ivhich the farm 
workers in the U.S. hove tried 
to better ihenuclvcs throueh the 
use of protest, 

Mr, MitcheU is one of the great 
organizers of tenant-farmers, la- 
borers, and sharecroppers. In the 
1930's he was the main force he- 
hind tlie organization of a Labor 
Union to help these people. Mr- 
Mitchell feels that the farm work- 
ers of America are still not getting 
their fair share because their liv- 
ing conditions over the last 100 
yeors have improved very little. 
Because of Mitchell's inspiration, 
the farm workers in the early 30*8 
and "lO's became a group of people 
ivho were not afraid to protest 
for tliemsclves. Although they 
hove protested frequently, it has 
done little good, because they are 
looked upon by a society as a 
lower claM and are not getting 
llieir fair share. 

Mr. Mitchell pointed out thai 
the farm workers ore still struggl- 
ing to gain their rightful place in 
life for themselves. Ho showed a 
great deal of concern over the sit- 
uation of the farm worker in the 
Soutli and especially in California 
where he acknowledged tlie work 



of Caesar Chavez. Chavez is Ihe 
organizer behind the great Cali- 
fornia Grope Boycott, in which 
the farm workers in California, 
under the supervision of The 
United Farm Workers and Cha- 
ve promoted a very suc- 
slrike in order to protest 
idiiions under which they 



iz. hi 

eessful 
the coi 
live. 

A film was al^o shotvn during 
the lecture which showed the poor 
living conditions in 1939 for the 
sharecroppers. In comparison to 
1939, the situation has changed 
very little over the past 30 years. 

Mr. Mitchell hopes that under 
the excellent supervision of people 
such as Caesar Chavez and the 
various labor unions, that the con- 
ditions of some men as servants 
ivill fiomeday change, and all 
people will hove a proper place in 
life.

Theme of Rally: 

To Live Peace Everyday 



Saturday, December 13 at 2:00 
p.m. the Fort Wayne Comnitllee 
to End the War had a rally in the 
cafeteria of the lUP extension. 
About tiiirty-five people were in 
attendance. There were no "hip- 
py" type people attending — most 
of the men were dressed in sweat- 
ers and slacks and the women 
were mostly in skirts or slacks. 

The main speaker was Father 
Pot McNulty. He noted that the 
purpose of the rally was to be a 
confrontation ivith others outside 
of til e peace groups. As he stated, 
it is nice to come together and 
talk of peace, but we (the mem- 
bers of the groupt should go out 
and talk lo others on a one to 
one basis. If enough people con. 
fronted otliers, new life would en- 
ter the rally. 

Rallying is good, hut the con- 
frontation should exist ALL the 
time. Advertising with leaflets, 
and posters were good, but the 
most efficient is the mouth to 
mouth type. He went on lo ex- 
plain that some people aru com- 
mitted wholeheartedly to tlie cause 
of peace while others are not 
committed so strongly. Those 
that are not completely committed 
seem to he struggling with the 
real nu^aning of peace. The reol- 
izaiion of peace is a personal 
thing. Each person should deepen 
his own personal attitude of peace 
through meditation, then go out 
to confront others. "Why ask 
another man for something you 
cah't give yourself?" 

Peace should be lived twenty-

Food Stamps •- 
Eliminate Hunger? 

&lt;Caatintird Fr(m Pagt Tica) 

The problem of hunger may 
never he completely eliminated, 
but if enough of the silent major- 
ity begins lo speak out against 
its present abundance in Amer- 
ica, great strides can be made 
toward its elimination. Start by 
doing something in Allen County. 
Our "far-sight" county comission. 
ers have already come out against 
a food stamp program in Fort 
Wayne because of the additional 
cost to the county in administer- 
ing the program. They didn't 
mention that the program is des- 
perately needed here or that the 
benefits received will be far 
greater than the expense incurred. 

So if you, as an individual, 
would like to do what you can 
to solve the problem of hunger in 
America, I suggest you sit down 
and wTite a few letters. First, your 
letter in support of the food 
stamp program. Address the let. 
ter to: 

Allen Co. Commissioners' Office 
715 South Calhoun Street 
Fort Wayne, Indiana 

Secondly, o letter from you lo 
Representative E. Ross Adair and 
letters lo Indiana Senators Hariko 
and Bayh may help them decide 
to vole for bills to provide more 
funds to a nli -poverty programs 
such as the food stamp program. 

Over half of our national bud- 
get goes lo military expenditures. 
Join the "movement". Add your 
; lo the growing number of 
a that woni to reorder our 
national priorities as well as re- 
arrange where our tar dollars 
spent. — David L. Smith 



To The Editor: 

To the student who was so up- 
set about the fact that he had to 
he fcoied on the floor during ihe 
recent shoiving of the Titicut 
Follies — it's time you were set 
straight. The fact is that the 
movie ivas shown for professional 
people in tlic community although 
students were et[uatly welcome. 
The fund that provided for the 
film was not from the student 
activities fund but part of a fed- 
erally-granted fund. Therefore, 
students with activity cards, like 
it or not, did not have a special 
priority to scats since this fund 
ivas not responsible for the show- 
ing of Ihe film. 



Dear Editor: 

My choice for our. team name 
is the PIONEERS. There are 
three reasons why I think that 
tliis is an especially appropriate

(1) Its first two letters a 
initials of our tivo parent bodies. 

(2} It fits well with the name 
of our city. 

(3) This is a pioneering insti- 
tution, bringing tivo major uni- 
versities together. 

It is my hope ihat these rea- 
sons, as well as those for other 
selections, will be published in 
the Commuidcalor prior to the 
voting, in an effort to help our 
student body make a reasoned 
choice. 



Dear Editor: 

In making a decision on school 
colors for the lU-PU Fort Wayne 
Campus, I would like to suggest 
that you give some thought to 
using a combination of the tra- 
ditional colors of both parent 
campuses. Specifically, perhaps a 
combination of white and gold 
or black and while might he ap- 
propriate. Although a decision on 
colors is not an item of tremen- 
dous importance in terms of main- 
taining an idea of a statewide fed- 
eration of university campuses, 
at least a partial maintenance of 
common colors and identity could 
support the idea of two multi- 
campus universities serving the

Silent MarchSlated

Again this month there ivill be 
activities for and against the war 
in Vietnam. The Fort Wayne 
Commillee to End the War held 
a rally in the cafeteria at ihe 
lU-PU Campus at 2:00 Saturday,

7:00 p.m. and walk single file 
along the sidewalk. Everyone is 
u'elcome to participate. 

Tlie Young Americans for Free-

for expression. 
He finds this substitute in the 
expressive media of music, art, 
and photography. 

The arts, music, and phologra- 
phy all serve as means of ex- 
pression, and also as an emotional 
outlet. Hoivever, expression as ai 
emotional outlet has a dark anc 
forbidding side. Undesirahli 
means of expression, and frus- 
trated emotions with no outlet hi 
volilale forees. Take for exampli , 
a young dropout with nothing but 
time on his hands. His meai 
c&gt;pressioii may lake many fi 
The weapon he uses to sen 
an outlet for these expressions 
may take many forms also, such 
as a knife, a rock, or even a gun. 
But these weapons are not the 
kind he needs to reach his goals 
or curve out his own identity. The 
'weapons' he uses to express his 
emotions are those of many of 
his conlemporaries today. Their 
outlet of expression consiituics a 
major problem of our society, the 
problem of vandalLiim. 

Suppose that in place of llicse 
weapons of frustration, tlie knives 
and rocks, a camera was put into 
his idle hands. Then, suppose that 
with this camera, this "society's 
child" could "shoot"' whatever he 
loved, or bated, envied or feared. 
What would be the result of point- 
ing a camera at the world, instead 
of a gun? -Is a picture worth a 
thousand words missing in the vo- 
cabulary of this dropout? 

The problem is. of course, get- 
ting Ibis camcro to the dropout. 
Think for a minute how a library 
works. A person can go into o 
library and walk out with the 
world at his fingertips. These 
books are loaned free of charge to 
the borrower, and the borrower 
mu-t reluni tl)is trust of (nitJi 
by returning tlu: book. Suppose 
one could borrow a camera as 
tbey would a book? A lending 
library for cameras is not as 
ridiculous as it sounds. If a con- 
cerned community donated cam- 
eras of all complexities and with 
instructions for use, of course, the 
idea miglit work. A simple box 
camera is easy to use, and irilh

Photography is an ideal media 
for children and young adults 
because it does not always require 
a large amount of knowledge 
skill lo take a good picture. After 
all. Bob Dylan dropped ou 
school before he began- writing 
good music. But with a lending 
library, a community could pro- 
vide a incans of expression avail- 
able to all. 

There would undoubtedly be op.

■e cameras do not cost any- 
than a set of books. If the

they can no doubt afford to 
provide some inexpensive cameras

Mental Health Technology, a 
part of the curriculum here at 
I.U.-P.U. Fort Wayne, is perhaps 
visualized by all Engineering, 
Teaching, Business, and Home Ec. 
majors as merely anotlier .opecial- 
ized field which is pursued like 
any other course of .study, for the 
sake of a profitable future career. 
To view it from the other side, 
however, is to see a completely 
and refreshingly new perspective. 

A talk ivith Robert Hawley, As- 
sistant Profcsor of Mental Health, 
reveals his very deep involvement

Mental Health Technology is more 
of an experience than just a series 
of classes for se»-erai reasons. One 
reason is ibat a week before school

"Sensivity Training" — a time 
when students gain a better self- 
awareness. Afler school officially 
opens, Menial Health students

Victory is a present stamped, 
don't open till Christmas." They 
breathed it, touched it, tasted it, 
and emcllcd it, but the scotch tope 
wouldn't come undone. 

dionQ-Purdue hit the road for 
two games at Purdue regional 
campuses. At Purdue Calumet 
Friday night, the Boiier-Hoosiers 
snow-balled 104 the fir^t 
four minutes. 

At ihc half, the margin in- 
creased 59-44. Battling evenly the 
second half, Fnrdue Calumet 
pped up the victory 109-88. 
Pith a bit of razzle-dazzle, I.U.- 
P.U.'s Gary Johnloz lit the spirit 
of victory tree by hitting for 29 
points. His output represents a 
.'w individual, one game scoring 

Sinn Schcnber, showing offen- 

vc spark lately, clicked for 18. 

Terry Co on an and Fred Craft 

chipped in 15 and 10 respectively. 

Saturday night the Boiler-Hoo- 
sicrs tore into the Christmas wrap- 
ping paper at Purdue North Cen- 
tral. At 3:57 into the game, I.U.- 
P.U. was out front 14-11. Scatter- 
ing a few ribbons off the victory 
package, they extended the lead 
26-19. With the lead and 8;47

eye got North Central back in 
it. Indiana-Purdue's Gary John- 
loz got a left-right combination, 
causing his eye to puff up. With 
Johnloz out, the opposition bung 
up a 39-36 half time bulge. 

Like a villain foreclosing the 
mortgage on a Southern planta- 
tion, North Central whipped their 
way to a frPll command. With 
12:31 lo go, it seemed the opposi- 
lion would run I.U.-P.U. hack 
home on a rail. 

Shaking off the sting of being 
out-scored 25-5 in seven minutes, 
the Boiler-Hoosiers found them- 
selves. Hibbons flew, paper flew, 
bows flew, and Indiana-Purdue 
new. Terry Coonan and Jim Rou- 
tiner, joined by Gary Johnloz, 

Reaching hard for the victory, 
llie Boiler-Hoosiers charred the 
neis by hilling for 41 points in 
the final 12 minutes. North Cen- 
lial gathered in 21 in the same 
time period, and held on to idn 
85-82. Scared pale. North Central 
had survived a 12 minute period 
when ihe Boiler-Hoosiers' con- 
nected on 83% from the field.

Lazy Day Suggestions 



by John Barton 

One of the most pressing ques- 
ions facing the modem college 
itudent is what he can do bettreen 
classes when be doesn't feel like 
studying and cari't afford to go 
anyplace else. 

There are a number of ways 
in which one can solve this prob- 
lem, although I must caution you 
that you may be breaking a few 
university rules if you use my 
suggestions. 

The main pastime at this cam- 
pus and many otiiers is that old 
stand-by, playing cards. Should 
this become boring, one can sim- 
ply think up a new game. New 
games are always being invented 
by our bored yet inventive stu-

Should you bet 
cards, one can go to the cafeteria 
and try lo shoot spit-ball-

After you have been chased 
of the cafeteria, you can retire to 
the student lounge. When you get 
to the lounge, go to the stereo 
□nd turn the volunc up as high 
as it will go. After you have done 
this you can sit back and watch 
people pour out of their offices. 
run lo ihc stereo, turn it down, 
and walk back to their offices 

These are only a few things 
that one can do, there 
others. If you are cau|
