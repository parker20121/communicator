Career Services changes name, plans relocation 



by Rachel Landrum, 
Staff Writer 

The offices of Career Services 
and Student Academic Counseling 
Services will be combining to form a 
new unit, Academic Counseling and 
Career Services (ACCS). 

The office will be located in 
Keltler Hall and is scheduled for 
completion by December. 

The union will form a stronger 
unit, according to Doug Neltzel, 
Director of ACCS. 

"By combining the two offices, 
we expect to impact and influence 
many more students at a much earli- 
er time," Neitzel said. 

Neitzel also believes the current 



counselors will be more involved in 
Human Resources, and will more 
efficiently direct students to appro- 
priate careers by being cross-trained 
in both departments. 

The joining of the two services 
gives students the convenience of 
having only one area to find the 
help they need in their search for a 
career path, 

Advisers and counselors from 
both offices will be offered opportu- 
nities to help students beyond their 
current reach of resources, and can 
avoid referring them to another 
office. 

Currently, the Student 
Academic Counseling Services pro- 
vides academic advising to certain 
subgroups on campus. 



Students in Pre- Business, unde- 
cided majors or those wanting to 
take only a few classes are a few of 
the groups referred to SACS. 

SACS assists students on choos- 
.ng their careers and gives them 
direction on classes to take toward 
graduation. 

Neiuel said, on a national aver- 
age, 70 percent of all freshmen 
change their major by their senior 
year. 

Career Services, located in Walb 
Rm. 113, is open to all students and 
offers programs to non-students. 

"We are all looking forward 
to the move," said Agnes Auchtung, 
Career Services receptionist. 

Auchtung said students are 
probably not expecting the move 



and renaming that is about to occur. 
' The services offered will remain 
largely unchanged. 

"People don't take advantage of 
the services that they offer," said 
IPFW student Heidi Hockemeyer. 

"I was really impressed with the 
advisers and I will go back again in 
the future. Students are really not 
using it to its full potential," added 
Hockemeyer. 

Hockemeyer worked with an 
adviser in Career Services to create a 
resum.e. 

She posted it on the Web 
Resume Book for potential employ- 
ers to review. 

Hockemeyer received more than 
12 calls from potential employers 
after the resume was posted. 



Job search booklets, employer 
literature, local employer directory, 
career counseling and RE Web, a 
Web-based resume creation, are 
other resources available through 
Career Services. 

"It's crucial to reach students 
before they graduate, especially 
those seeking internships. Actually, 
they should come in by their sopho- 
more year, but less that 10 percent 
do. Our job is to develop familiarity 
with education and what follows," 
said Nietzel. 

Until the scheduled merger, 
both offices will remain in their cur- 
rent locations. 



IPSGA proposes 24-hour computer lab 



by Angela VanDaele 
Staff Writer 

A 24-hour computer lab on campus 
is an idea James Corson, student 
government vice president, wants 
to make a reality. 
"A 24 hour computer lab 
will allow students to have com- 
puter access at their own convenience," 
Corson said. 

Currently the open computer labs 
throughout campus are open from 8:30 
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, 12:30 p.m. 
to 10:30 p.m. on Sundays and 7:30 a.m. to 
11:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. 

The library lab is open from 8 a.m. to 6 
p.m. on Fridays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays, 
noon to 11 p.m. on Sundays and 8 a.m. to 
1 1 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays. 

"The lab could be located in the 24- 
hour study lounge connected to the 
library," said Corson. 

There is also the possibility of opening 
a 24-hour lab in Walb Union if the lab in 
the study lounge, is unsuccessful. 

The computer kiosks, currently located 
in the study lounge, allow students to use 
electronic mail as well as library resources. 

The proposed computer stations would 
have the software for every major, Internet 
service, word processing as well as e-mail, 
access to the library resources and a 
printer. 

The funding for the lab could be allo- 
cated by student government or other

sources. 

Frank 
Borelli, vice 
chancellor of 
Student 
Affairs, said 
the opening of 
a 24-hour 
computer lab 
would not 
raise the stu- 
dent technolo- 
gy fee. 

However, 
many steps 
must be taken 
before a 24- 
hour lab will be approved. 

Corson is scheduled to meet with the 
ITS committee on March 16 to discuss the 
feasibility of an "around-the-clock" comput- 
er lab. 

ITS services has set up a question and 
answer forum on the Internet regarding the 
lab at www.ipfw.edu/forums/ 

stucmnts/ stucmts.htm/ 

"Anyone can post questions, com- 
ments, rumors, etc, and we will do our best 
to address each one," said William Baden, 
coordinator of academic computing. 

Those who wish to contact Corson on 
the matter may call his office at 481-6589 
or e-mail him at suvpl^holmes. ifpw.edu/ 



Library gets a makeover 



Basketball coaches resign 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Edflor 



IPFW Athletic Director Stanley "Butch" 
Perchan announced the resignation of 
men's and women's basketball coaches Pam 
Bowden and John Williams. 

Bowden has accumulated a 53-80 over- 
all record in five years here at IPFW. 
Bowden, who came here from the 



University of Alaska Anchorage, brought a 
NCAA Division 11 berth in 1994. 

Williams came here three years ago 
from the University of Saint Francis where 
he was athletic director and head basketball 
coach. 

Williams has a 31-49 overall record, 
including a Great Lakes Valley Conference 
Tournament berth this season. 

The athletic department and the 
coaches declined comment.

Multiple resources available for math students 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 



An average of 3,500 students 
are enrolled in mathematics courses 
each semester at IPFW, and with the 
year half completed, many students 
are beginning to pay more attention 
to their studies. 

Both the mathematics depart- 
ment and transitional studies 
attempt to provide students with 
adequate assistance and tutoring. 

"Transitional studies has one- 
on-one free tutoring and every stu- 



dent is entitled to a certain amount 
of free tutoring," said Jim 
Hersberger, associate chair 
and professor of mathematics. 

Students are entitled to two 
hours of free one-on-one tutoring 
per week through transitional stud- 
ies; however, this is only one way 
that students can receive assistance. 

Transitional studies also offers 
group tutoring and some classes 
even have assigned times for stu- 
dents to meet if they have questions 
over the material. 

Another option for students is 



to visit the math department and 
have a professor answer their ques- 
tions. 

"For the pre-calculus courses, 
we have common office hours," 
Hersberger said. "Most of the profes- 
sors agree to participate and their 
numbers are given to all the stu- 
dents (in pre-calculus math classes)." 

Open-access computer labs 
throughout the campus also have 
tutorial programs for the pre-calcu- 
lus courses that allow students to 
practice doing math problems. 

Also, on Cable Channel 6, class- 



room lessons for some of the math 
courses are shown and videos of 
these lessons can also be obtained at 
the Helmke library. 

Besides these resources, 
Hersberger believes that students 
would benefit from open-access 
tutoring during all campus hours. 

"One of my goals for the next 
five years is to have open-access 
tutoring available for all of the hours 
that IPFW is open," Hersberger said. 

Because IPFW. is a commuter 
campus, Hersberger thinks that 
open-access tutoring would make 



math assistance more accessible for 
students who have to leave campus 
immediately after their last class of 
the day for work or other 
obligations. 

To find out which professors are 
participating in open office hours, 
visit either the mathematics depart- 
ment or speak with a professor in 
the mathematics department. 

To sign up for transitional stud- 
ies, group tutoring and or one-on- 
one tutoring, visit transitional stud- 
ies in Kettler Rm. 202. 



Writer Hempel sheds light on fiction stories 



by Sarah Christie, 
Staff Writer 



Fiction writer Amy Hempel read excerpts 
from her works at the Omnibus Lecture Scries 
on Feb. 23. 

Hempel has written many short stories 
that have been published in a variety of 
magazines. 

Hempel presented some of her short sto- 
ries and provided information on the situations 
that caused her to write about each special 
incident 

in order to give the audience a different 
outlook on her craft, Hempel shared many 
short stories written by other well-known 
writers. 

Hempel's stories mainly focus upon her 



love for dogs and other animals. 

When Hempel was asked what inspired 
her, she said, "My dogs." 

Hempel explained that volunteer experi- 
ence also inspires her writings because of the 
many crisis situations encountered. 

"Hempel has the ability to distill in few 
lines the essence of a moment," said Michael E. 
Kaufmann, associate professor of English and 
director of liberal studies. 

Hempel believes that short stories appeal 
to readers because the meaning can be recog- 
nized in a moment. Hempel's shortest story is 
only 43 words. 

During the question-and-answer session of 
the presentation, Hempel said the humor in 
her short stories is due to years of going out 
with her comedian friends and watching their 



shows. 

The process of writing short stories i 
"about selectivity," said Hempel. 

Short stories only include the most rele- 
vant information. 

Hempel said that when starting to write a 
short story, she always knows the beginning 
and the end, but never the middle. 

She also revealed personal information 
about how often she works. 

Hempel believes that it is not necessary' 
put in a full day of writing everyday. 

According to Hempel, short stories are 
interesting because they can leave you con- 
fused and "distinctly uneasy." 

"Hempel was able to open up our campu: 
to a new style of writing," said Joe Schroeder, 
IPSGA president.

TOPIC: 

Hackers 

WHAT WE 
THINK: 

Who can feel 
comfortable using 
the school's 
computers? 



Since the introduction of 
computers there has always 
been a concern for hacking. 
Until recently, I thought that 
I was safe from hacking; 
apparently, I was wrong. 

A recent story released in 
The Communicator stated 
that a security breach on 
IPFW's e-mail server PINE was 
reported. 

I don't know about you, 
but this issue troubles me 
because a hacker can access 
my personal student records 
via e-mail. 

Imagine your whole col- 
lege career at the fingertips 
of one of these computer 
crackers. How many of you 
have e-mail accounts on a 
computer at your home or 
office? These also can be 
hacked if the hacker has the 
right know-how. For example, 
if your student ID numbers 
are your social security num- 
bers, you could have more 
trouble than you realize. 



A social security number 
is a link to a person's entire 
life. Just think about what 
you use your social security 
number for: tax identifi-l 
cation, military seri- J 
al number, credit &lt;* 
record report, stu- 
dent ID number--the 
list is endless. 

Now assuming 
that someone 
could access 
this personal 
information. 
imagine the end 
less poss 
bilities 
fraud: credit 
card, bank 
account, 
not to mention an 
identity change. 

I guess the thing 
that concerns me the most is 
that hackers (living human 
beings who know Full well 
what they are doing) had 
direct access to my personal 
records via my e-mail. 

Now after reading this, 
you may be feeling some 
uneasiness and concern for 
our school's computer securi- 
ty, but the school's computer 
network is not the only place 
where these hackers can gain 




access. 
Not only can they access 
the school's computer system 
but they can do this any 
where in the world. Now, 
don't you feel better?

"What we call progress is the 
exchange of one Nuisance for 
another Nuisance." 

■Havelock Ellis 



£etter to tfte Editor 



As the only original WIPU 
employee still living in the area, I'd 
like to correct one point in your 
article "Radio station may be in 
campus future" (Feb 18). 

The reporter states that "1PFW 
had a radio station called WIPU that 
was shut down due to conflict 
between the administration and the 
station staff." 

Not true. There was no conflict 
between the administration and the 
station staff. The conflict arose 
between IPFW and Purdue 
University-West Lafayette, IPFW's 
fiscal agent. The problem was over 
the funding of WIPU. 

WIPU had originally been 
pitched to Purdue-West Lafayette as 
a self-sustaining radio station and 
basically, in the beginning, it was. 
The station manager was the IPFW 
Assistant University Relations 
Director and the two employees (of 
whom I was one) hired to deal with 
the day-to-day activities of the sta- 



tion employees were paid through 
Comprehensive Employee and 
Training Act (CETA) grant. When 
CETA was discontinued, IPFW 
picked up the two full-time posi- 
tions. Soon thereafter, Purdue-West 
Lafayette realized that WIPU was 
not self-sufficient and rather than 
get too involved in another radio 
station (they were supporting 
WBAA at the West Lafayette cam- 
pus) Purdue decided to cut their 
losses and get out of the radio busi- 
ness in Fort Wayne. Luckily for 
WIPU and Fort Wayne, a group of 
WIPU's listeners had become loyal 
and committed fans of what WIPU 
was doing {broadcasting classical 
music, jazz and other programming 
not found anywhere else on the 
radio dial, produced and hosted by 
students, faculty members, and 
community volunteers). These won- 
derful folks, concerned about the 
fate of "their radio station," 
approached IPFW and Purdue-West 



Lafayette about obtaining the FCC 
license and leasing the broadcast 
equipment for a transition period. 

Purdue agreed. WIPU's friends 
created and incorporated the non- 
profit organization called Public 
Broadcasting of Northeast Indiana, 
Incorporated (PBNI) and WBNI was 
born. 

While WIPU had strong support 
from many on the IPFW faculty, it 
was the conflict between IPFW and 
Purdue-West Lafayette over the 
funding of WIPU that ultimatelv 
lead to IPFW/Purdue-Wes't 
Lafayette shutting down, or rather, 
relinquishing the campus radio sta- 
tion.

Vegetarianism 



What is the deal with vegetari- 
ans? These people won't eat some- 
thing that our forefathers have 
eaten for thousands of years. These 
are the same people who WOULD 
jump off a cliff if someone told 
them to. 

Basically, this is what the vege- 
tarian movement is: Someone came 
on TV and said, "Meat is bad, don't 
eat it anymore." The gullible people 
then stopped eating meat. 

Some kinds of vegetarians are 
better than others, like the people 
that don't rub it in your face when- 
ever you want to sink your chop- 
pers in a nice, big, juicy T-Bone. Or 
the people that are allergic to meat, 
and the people for whom eating 
meat is against their religion. 

These vegetarians are OK in my 
book, but my problem is with the 
ones who cringe and make fun of 
you when you want to eat a piece of 
chicken. 

"OH MY GOD! How can you eat 
that? That thing was ALTVET This is 
the most brain-dead excuse for 
being a vegetarian. Do these people 



think about what they're sajing? 

Someone said that to me once 
when I was eating a hunk of meat. 
Right then, 1 couldn't say anything. 

The next time I saw her, she was 
eating a carrot. So, I, of course, said 
"OH MY GOD! How can you eat 
that? That thing was ALIVE!" Do 
you know what she said? "Yeah, but 
it didn't have feelings." 

I almost fell to the floor laugh- 
ing, but instead I said. "So that 
makes it OK to eat?" "Yes" was her 
reply. 

I was sick of talking to her then, 
so I told her how stupid she was 
and left. 

First of all, does anyone know 
that plants don't have feelings, just 
because they can't voice their pain? 

If I were mute and couldn't 
make a noise, I sure hope that 
nobody would come up to me and 
eat me because I couldn't voice my 
pain. 

Secondly, killing animals before 
you eat them is the humane thing 
to do. 

If anyone out there is familiar 



by Matthew Perry, 
Staff Writer 



with the "Red Green Show," there 
was one episode where all the 
Possum Lodge members were going 
to slaughter a cow for dinner. 

Red and Harold were talking 
about it while Harold was eating an 
apple, and he said something to the 
effect of "How can you eat that ani- 
mal, it was ALIVE?" To which Red 
replied, "Yeah, well killing it is the 
humane thing to do. That apple 
you're eating is STILL alive." 

I personally would rather eat 
something that I know is dead, 
rather that eat something that is 
still alive. Anyway, vegetarianism is 
just a fad that will soon fade away, 
like all of the '80s fad diets that 
never worked. 

The only true way to be a "veg- 
etarian'' is to eat things that never 
were alive. So, a "true vegetarian" 
would have to live entirely on 
absolutely non-organic foods, like 
Twinkies. 

Who would die first, someone 
who eats a steak everyday, or some- 
one who eats only Twinkies and 
cupcakes?

Too Many Times to the Well 



by Donald Westover, Esq. , 
Staff Writer 



Politics under fire 



Being the cutting-edge and 
seat-of-the-pants organization 
that we at The Communicator 
are, we bring the latest and break- 
ing news. 

As this your most abject and 
humble servants so dutifully 
informed you, the reader, at the 
end of this last missive, today's 
timely topic is the pending hear- 
ing on Independent Counsel Law. 

Here's a mercifully brief back- 
ground from the pages of the 
Philadelphia Tribune. 

In the late nineteenth centu- 
ry, a law was enacted that would 
allow for the appointment of a 
Special Prosecutor to investigate 
possible crimes by the Executive 
Branch of government. 

Well, things went pretty 
smoothly, fellow buckeroos, until 
the incident forever remembered 
as the "Saturday Night Massacre" 
occurred. 

On that "Dark and Stormy 
Night" (with regards to Mr. 
Lytton) President Nixon decreed 
that Special Prosecutor Cox 
should be removed. 

Well, fellow travellers, this 
brought to pass no small commo- 
tion and the passage shortly after 
of the Independent Counsel Law 
currently in effect. 

Under this law, if the Attorney 
General should believe an investi- 
gation of the higher-ups is neces- 
sary, he or she meets with a 
three-judge panel and they 
appoint a special prosecutor. 

Contrary to the earlier law, 
under the present law the 
Independent Counsel cannot be 
fired by the Attorney General. It 
is""p~artially due to; this, and the 
apparent lack. of.aecoumKtbUisy; 
that problems have arisen. 

! From an article off the 
Associated Press entitled "Starr 
Probe may Prove Death Knell to 
Independent Counsel Act," by 
Laurie Kellman, your faithful ear 
learned that because of the 
lengthy and costly investigation 
into the Iran-Contra affair, the 
Law was allowed to lapse in the 
early 90s. 

Oddly enough, it was newly 
elected President Clinton's lobby- 
ing efforts which helped to rein- 
state it in 1994. 

Due to his frustration with the 
Attorney General's refusal to 
appoint a special prosecutor to 
investigate alleged campaign 
donation violations, Senator Orrin 
Hatch, R-Utah, states that he 
opposes the act. 

But he also believes that, 



"Some kind of law is needed that 
separates the administration in 
power from those investigating 
it." 

"Checks and balances," as Tim 
P., graduate marketing student, 
describes it. 

Senator Hatch goes on to state 
that Ms. Reno's refusal "Makes it 
plain as day that we need some 
law that protects the decision (of 
appointing a special counsel) 
from attorneys General who are 
incompetent or at least misunder- 
stand the intent of the law." 

Asked how that law might 
read, Senator Hatch replied, "It's 
a good question, I don't know 
anybody who has the answer." 

Maybe nobody has the 
answer, but Tim P. has a couple of 
ideas. "Maybe a multiple review 
steps to make sure the procedure 
is still being reviewed as fair and 
impartial by a different judge at a 
different step along each path of 
the.... review." 

Because of the length of the 
investigation, he feels that, "It 
(the investigation) could have 
been reviewed as to the whether 
it's fair and impartial by a differ- 
ent judge at six-month intervals." 

When asked if he feels that 
the law should be allowed to 
expire, he replied that, "Keeping 
the law is O.K. if we get a better 
system of fairness that's accept- 
able to both sides." 

However it is amended, the 
consensus on the Hill is that it 
must be changed. 

Even one of the authors of the 
law, Senator Carl Levin, D.- 
Michigan, states in Ms. Kellman's 
artic-le t,hatT--U -.aefids to be 
■"Radka:U-y'.ee£6rme&lt;I : ^o reign in 
the independent counsel, if it is to 
be renewed." 

Because of alleged leaks ema- 
nating from the Starr's office to 
the New York Times concerning 
Starr's ability to indict the presi- 
dent, Attorney General Reno is 
considering appointing an inde- 
pendent counsel to investigate the 
independent counsel. (Wheels 
within wheels). 

To quote from a CNN article, 
dated Feb. 19, entitled, "Legal 
Outsider considered to Probe Ken 
Starr's Office," "In a meeting with 
(Deputy Attorney General) Holder 
a week ago, Senator Orrin Hatch, 
a Utah Republican and the 
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee demanded an indepen- 
dent investigation because the 
Justice Department would be seen 
as having a conflict of interest." 



I believe a part of the disen- 
chantment with the current inves- 
tigation is its departure from its 
original roots. 

To quote from one of our fel- 
low students, Katie H., English 
Literature major, "Well, I think 
because it started off that he was 
investigating something that 
turned into something totally dif- 
ferent, I kinda' question the 
motives of everybody and 1 think 
it was just... set up to prove a 
point, I don't think anybody ever 
expected anything to really come 
of it- even in the government." 

I believe this has mystified 
many through the long months 
and may be part of the general 
frustration associated with the 
investigation. 

In closing, 1 would like to 
defer to another student, one 
Stacie B. When asked what her 
thoughts were now that the 
Impeachment Hearings are over 
and President Clinton has been 
acquitted, she replied, "I think 
they should have impeached him 
the first time, and now it's over." 
Cue the large one. 

Next time: 

There is a debate at the pre- 
sent time concerning establishing 
a national pool of medical 
records, which would supposedly 
facilitate patient care by making 
medical records more accessible, 
.reduce paperwork and possibly 
aid in development of treatments 
for disease. 

Man)' insurance companies 
are in favor and so are some 
physicians. What do you think?

Trudy Pixler's adult group opens the concert with "Blowin 1 in the Wind." 



by Mishanna Wood, 
News Editor 



Lights dimmed at 
Williams Theatre as Trudy 
Bixler's adult group prepared 
to perform the opening num- 
ber, "Blowin' in the Wind," at 
the twelfth annual music ther- 
apy concert on Friday, Feb. 26 
at 7 p.m. 

The adult group created 
rhythmic sound effects with a 
tambourine, drum and 
maracas. 

The concert featured per- 
formers ranging in age from 
toddlers to seniors. 

The clients had various 
developmental disorders. 

The entire concert and all 
performances were conducted 
by student music therapists 
and their clients. 

'The students have been 
working with clients since 
September or October. Most of 
them have been working since 
January on the concert," said 
Nancy Hager, clinic supervi- 
sor. 

The "Scarf Routine" per- 
formed by junior Stephanie 
Pons and her client 'Nicholas" 
is an example of one-on-one 
relationship. The duo danced 
and twirled starves in unison 
to the "The Lion King." 

"We just got ready. This 
is very rewarding. 1 have been 
doing this for about four 
months," said Potts. 

During "Can you find the 
instrument," Anna Lyon, a 



junior, played the guitar and 
sang. In the meantime, her 
client Smith had to pick out 
the correctly shaped instru- 
ment to accompany her. Smith 
and Lyon also played the 
"Fanvell Song" on their gui- 
tars. 

Junior Karen Beyke 
played the piano as "Drew" 
sang "The Airplane Song" for 
the last performance. 

For the Finale, all partici- 
pants and the audience joined 
together to sing "You've got a 
friend in me." 

"I think it went fabulous- 
ly. These folks develop a sense 
of esteem by being among 
others in an ensemble type of 
setting. I think a lot of folks in 
this audience were in an intro- 
ductory music therapy class 
and they got the chance to see 
an actual practical applica- 
tion of music therapy. It's a 
real highlight," said Raymond 
Marchionni, chair of the music 
department. 

Ben Christ&gt;, dean of Fine 
and Performing Arts, said this 
clinic concert ended music 
therapy month. 

IPFW's has the only on- 
campus music therapy clinic 
in Indiana, as well as the only 
state-supported school that 
has a degree program in 
music therapy. 

"We're proud of our 
music therapy program," 
Christy said.

ial skills of a group of 
ten adults from Angola. 

Therapists work with a 
wide range of disorders such 
as alcoholism, drug abuse, 
autism and mental retarda- 
tion. 

Prior to working with 
Parker, the group was 
always told what to do by 
someone else. The individ- 
uals could work with oni 
person, but not with sever- 
al people. There was very 
little interaction between 
the clients in Parker's 
group at the beginning. 
During a typical session, 
the clients had to take 
turns with each other and 
choose who would next 
play a song to enforce 
social interaction. The 



individuals also had to share 
instruments and do simple 
song writing. Direct eye con- 
tact was present while 
addressing a client by name. 

"Every time a person said 
the name of a peer, that per- 
son would be reinforced with 
a piece of candy. When a per- 
son addressed a peer 100 
limes, we would have a party," 
Parker said. 

Data is collected at the 
beginning of treatment and at 
the end of treatment to mea- 
sure how an individual is pro- 
gressing, Parker said. 

After four months of 
practice the group was inter- 
acting with each other all the 
time. 

"It's good to see how far 
they've come. You can com- 



pare how they were doing at 
the beginning to how they are 
doing at the end. 

The effort and time put in 
by Parker and her clients was 
just one example of good that 
can come out of music thera- 
py- 

"Music therapists use 
music to change behaviors or 
thoughts in people with spe- 
cial needs or problems. For 
example, we teach them to 
play guitars so they can 
improve motor skills. We 
mainly focus with work on 
social skills, motor skills, emo- 
tional skills and academic 
skills," said Parker. 

Parker said, most clients 
at the IPFW clinic are from 
Anthonv Wayne Services, the 
state developmental center 



and other human services. 
Some clients are brought in by 
their parents. 

The clients have to fill 
out a history form and are 
then matched them up with a 
student in the music therapy 
field who would work well 
with them. 

"We have a waiting list 
for clients depending on the 
students that we have and 
what level they are at. A stu- 
dent firsts works with an indi- 
vidual and then with a group," 
Parker said. 

The services offered to 
music therapy clients are free. 
To make donations or learn 
more about music therapy one 
can contact the Director of 
music therap&gt;, Linda Wright- 
Bower at 481-6715.

Huffman Prairie Winds Woodwind Quartet 
visits IPFW 



by Adam Taylor 
Features Editor 



The United States Air Force Band of Flight 
will be represented on campus on Sunday, 
March 7, by the Huffman Prairie Winds 
Woodwind Quintet. 

The quintet, under the command of Major 
Sam Pohl and Staff Sergeant Airman Jeffrey C. 
Wacker, operations coordinator, is a branch of 
a band that is comprised of 60 full-time musi- 
cians. The group provides quality music and 
entertainment for a wide variety of official mili- 
tary, recruiting and community relations 
events. 

In addition to the Huffman Prairie Winds 
Woodwind Quintet, the USAF Band of Flight 
includes other small groups such as The 
Concert Band, The Night Flight Jazz Ensemble, 
The Wright Brass, Systems Go, and the 
Contemporary' Clarinet Quartet. 

The Huffman Prairie Winds Woodwind 
Quintet, named for the nearby historic plain 
where the Wright Brothers conducted many of 
their early aviation experiments, released their 



first recording, Blue Skies, in December of 
1994. 

Since then, Senior Airman Craig Robison, 
Senior Airman Mary Nan Ferrara, Senior 
Airman Robert D. Jordan, Senior Airman 
Michelle Kuntz and Senior Airman Jeffrey C. 
Wacker have been busy touring across the 
Midwest in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and 
Kentucky to drum up support for the Air Force 
and provide campuses such as IPFW quality 
entertainment at no cost to the students. 

The Quintet performs a variety of music 
that ranges from the traditional classical brand 
to more upbeat show tunes and ragtime. 

This versatility allows for the entertain- 
ment of large audiences in different settings 
that include social functions for the military 
and civilians, high schools and colleges, as well 
as formal evening recitals. 

The Huffman Prairie Winds Woodwind 
Quartet will be performing Sunday, March 7, at 
4 p.m. in the Neff Recital Hall. Admission is 
free.

Government warns against use 
of drugs in foreign countries 



by Carrie Leathers 
Chief Reporter 



Disorderly behavior, 
drugs, and alcohol can all 
cause American citizens to end 
up in jail while traveling 
abroad and the U.S. 
Department of State Bureau of 
Consular Affairs, is hoping to 
warn students planning to 
travel abroad about these dan- 
gers. 

More than 2500 American 
citizens are arrested abroad 
each year and about half of 
these are drug-related charges. 

Although some drugs that 
are illegal in the United States 
are not illegal to buy or con- 
sume in other countries, some 
foreign countries have equal, 
or even stronger, laws against 
drug possession and use than 
the United States. 

"It is your responsibility 



to know what the drug laws 
are in a foreign country before 
you go, because 'I didn't know 
it was illegal' will not get you 
out of jail," states the 
Department of State 
Publication 10307 relating to 
travel warnings on drugs 
abroad. 

American citizens who 
break laws in foreign countries 
cannot look to the U.S. for 
obtaining immediate release. 
The U.S. government will only 
make sure that you are treated 
fairly and safely by the 
authorities of the country. 

"Each year, many 
American students serve time 
in foreign jails or await trial in 
detention because they were 
unaware of the risks of using 
or possessing drugs while 
overseas," said Madeleine K. 
Albright in a national press 
release to student newspaper 
editors. 

Besides drug offenses, stu- 



dents are also arrested for dis- 
orderly conduct and inappro- 
priate behavior associated 
with heavy drinking. 

Also, students under the 
influence of drugs and or alco- 
hol are more at risk of being 
robbed or raped, especially 
while in an unfamiliar foreign 
place. 

In a February 1999 infor- 
mational release relating to 
travel safety for students, the 
U.S. Department of State 
Bureau of Consular Affairs 
stated, "To have a safe trip, 
avoid risky behavior and 
become familiar with the basic 
laws and customs of the coun- 
try you plan to visit before 
you travel."

Lecture by Professor Nusbaumer 
highlights 'Monument Ave. 1 screening 



by Kelty Bergman, 
Managing Editor 



If you missed "Monument Ave." last 
weekend at the Cinema Center, you 
missed out on an exploration of a dete- 
riorating society that many Americans 
have clung to for generations, a society 
in which you walk a line between follow- 
ing your heart and following the rules 
which society has laid out for you, a 
society of crime and corruption that 
feed the society and a society in which 
you either live well or you obey the law. 

That is the society that is present in 
"Monument Ave." 

That society was also the topic of a 
discussion led by Michael Nusbaumer, 
professor of sociology. 

Nusbaumer stated that we have had 
wars on drugs, wars over race, and now 
a war on poor people. 

In the film a traditional Irish 
neighborhood is beginning to be over- 
run by yuppies. 

The title of the film comes from an 
instance when the main character, 
played by Denis Leary, tells a story 
about one of his friends who breaks into 



a yuppie's house and falls asleep on the 
yuppies bed. 

The friend may have fallen asleep in 
the house due to how comfortable he 
was in the environment, wanting to feel 

as though this was his. 

The only way that most of the peo- 
ple in the film can make a reasonable 
wage is by resorting to a life of crime. 

Jackie, the local crime boss, pro- 
vides for much of the neighborhood 
showing how much authority and sup- 
port crime has for the community. 

This social construction can only 
exist in a society in which money was an 
item that was needed by everyone. 

The movie also demonstrates a shift 
from the industrial movement of the last 
30 years in which being an uneducated 
factory worker could support a family to 
a society where machines have taken 
their places and the jobs are low paying 
and hard to find. 



Motley Crue invades the Fort 



by Jasen Savage 
Stan Writer 



The boys in Motley Crue are at an inter- 
esting point on the great rock 'n roll highway 
to heck right now. When pondering their exis- 
:e, one must pose the question, "So, are 
they like, still cool or not?" Each side of that 
argument has its own armies, one side shout- 

" Motley Peking rules!" and the other 
iding back with their Pearl Jam bootlegs 
and Gadzooks Korn shirts, snickering about 
hair bands. 

Monday night at the Memorial Coliseum, 
Crue advocates had their moment in the 
strobe. Nikki Sixx and the gang performed a 
greatest hits package to a crowd of fist-shak- 
ing, head banging (and less than maximum 
capacity) crowd. Covering periods from their 
nearly twenty-year long career, Motley Crue 
jumped and bashed out the kind of music that 
not only made them rich, but also. ..defined a 
generation! {Imagine a deep, booming voice 
saying that part.) 

Motley Crue, while introducing the third 
song in the set "Livewire," asked the crowd to 
forget that it was 1999 and imagine the clock 
had been turned back to 1981. They were also 
asked to imagine that instead of a huge arena, 
they were at some small club in LA This was 
probably done to inspire the crowd to appreci- 
ate just how far their Crue had come, but the 
underlying tone could also have been to 
embrace the past that the band once had and 
take a trip down memory lane. 

This is the point where 1 must confess that 
there probably wasn't a bigger Motley fan 
than me, circa sixth grade (1983). "Shout at 
the Devil" had just been released, and I 




thought these guys were the be-all end-all of 
rock music. My tastes, of course, have shifted 
over the years, and as far as rock goes, bands 
such as Motley Crue have long since given way 
to things like Soul Coughing and Afghan 
Whigs. This is the case with many people my 
age. Things change, fans move on (sort of like 
the story of "Puff the Magic Dragon," only 
with sex and drugs). 

It was also a kind of full circle for me, see- 
ing as how this was the first band I had ever 
seen in concert back in 1985. 

The fans at the show didn't care what 
anyone else had to say about the band 
though. They were there because they loved 
the music and wanted to have a good time. 

The band was more than happy to oblige. 
They seem to realize that alienating the faith- 
ful would be a knife to the wrist. As with Kiss, 
Motley Crue knows that the time when they 
were fresh and new has passed, but they hav 
too much of a following to call it quits. In their 
wisened age, they have found other avenues t( 
keep their names in the public eye, such a: 
opening a clothing store in Hollywood called 
Scrue (yeah, I thought so, too). Then there is 
Tommy Lee's illustrious film career. 

With all this, it still comes down to the 
fans, though. In cities and towns all over, there 
are people at the shows singing along with all 
the ferocity they sang with in the 80s. Anyone 
must give credit to a band that can hold "em 
that long. Besides, I haven't seen any Rail doc- 
umentaries on VH-1 recently. Sure, maybe 
they don't play in front of as many people 
anymore, and they coincidentally get into con- 
troversy and trouble right when a new album 
comes out, but a lot of people who trash them 
now were the same ones "shouting at the 
Devil" so many years ago. Girls, you know you 
liked "Home Sweet Home" and 
thought they were cute, and guys, 
you have to admire them at least 
for the fact that all of them (even 
Mick Mars, the "ugly one") have 
had more sex than we could ever 
iW. dream of. 

After seeing what 1 saw Monday 
night, I can't say I will run out to 
replace my old Crue collect' 
but I will admit it is a part of who 
1 was in those days of my rebel- 
lious youth. 

Until the Winger reunion, Jasen 
Savage.

NCAA College Basketball Tournament Preview 



by Malt Scheer, 
Staff Wf iter 



If you are a sports Junkie like me, then 
March Madness provides a fix for the rest of 
this month. 

The timing is perfect because the weather 
usually sucks, and none of the other active 
sports provide the same level of excitement as 
college hoops. 

This week is dubbed "championship 
week," as conference tournaments provide 
dozens of exciting games that give the little 
schools a chance to make the tourney. These 
lesser-known conferences play earlier in the 
week to determine who will represent them. 

Personally, I have mixed feelings about 
these tournaments. They are exciting and fun 
to watch, especially because I know little about 
the players and teams. The problem I have 
with these tournaments is that they render the 
regular season almost meaningless. 

If a team gels hot and wins their confer- 
ence tournament, then they get in, even with a 
losing record. 

Many conferences get only one bid, the 
tournament champion. More emphasis should 
be placed on winning the regular season title 
than winning four games in four days. 

The larger conferences such as Big Ten, 
Big East, ACC and SEC send anywhere from 
three to seven teams, and usually don't leave 
out a deserving team. 

The Pac-10 is the only major conference 
not to sell out, sending Stanford as its regular 
season champion. 

Good or bad, these made for TV tourna- 
ments are exciting to watch. However, I would 
expect the creative minds in the advertising 
department of ESPN to come up with some- 
thing better than the happy happy fun time 
cartoons featuring Dickie V. 

For example, showing highlights of previ- 
ous tournament upsets, buzzer beaters, and 
alley-oops would be much better than recy- 
cling die cartoon theme. 

Selection Sunday officially gets things 
under way. The selection shows on TV are Tun 
to watch, especially when they have a live 
camera on the "bubble teams" ready to gauge 
their reactions. 

The teams either jump up and dance 
around, celebrating their invitation, or sit 
stone-faced and dejected, realizing that their 
seasons, and often basketball careers, are over. 
Few truly deserving teams are left out, 
and the ones that are have a very little chance 
of advancing against the national powerhous- 
es. The next few days give the fans a chance to 
read and watch the experts analyze and pre- 
dict. 

Then begins the agonizing process of fill- 
ing out your brackets. As you pick your 



upsets, narrowing your 64 down to 4, you cry 
to combine your predictions, with what you 
think others will think. It is truly a very unsci- 
entific process, but one thing you can count on 
is upsets will happen. 

A #13 usually knocks off a "4, the same with 
#12 and "5 and #11 and #6. and by noon on 
Thursday, the picks are in and the fun begins! 

Luckily I don't have to blow off my classes 
this semester, because it all gets underway 
over spring break. 

Between noon and 6 p.m. and from 7:07 
p.m. until midnight on Thursday and Friday 
there are thirty-two games. 

After sixteen more on Saturday and 
Sunday, the field is reduced to 16, and you 
usually know if you're still in the hunt to win 
the pool. 

Although Duke is the prohibitive favorite 
to win it all, neither Kansas nor Arizona, 
favorites in the last two tournaments made it 
to the Final Four. 

The most compelling aspect of the NCAA 
Tournament is that you can never accurately 
predict who is going to be there at the end. 

Utah and Stanford surprised everyone last 
year with their Final Four appearances. 

1 expect both of those teams to do well again 
this year for three reasons: 

1) Tournament experience, Having been 
there already definitely helps, but the flip side 
is that everyone is gunning for you. 

2) Half-court game. The pace of the game 
is usually much slower in the big dance, and 
both teams execute the half court game as well 
as anyone. 

3) The point guard. The reason these 
teams execute so well is that their leaders are 
among the best in college, 

Andre Miller of Utah is a player of the 
year candidate, and Stanford's Arthur Lee has 
led the Cardinals to a Pac-10 Championship, 
and possible # 1 seed. 

Duke looks nearly unstoppable. It will 
lake a terrible (shooting) game by the Blue 
Devils, and a nearly perfect game for anyone 
to knock them off. 

They have more talent, depth, and athleti- 
cism than any team in the country. If that 
isn't enough, they have the revenge factor 
going for them. 

In case you forgot, they blew a 20-point 
lead in the second-half to Kentucky last year 
in the regional final. They haven't, and you 
know Coach K (arguably the best) hasn't, for- 
gotten. 

1, like most fans would like to see them 
lose, (sorry Rob) simply because it won't be 
exciting to watch them win by twenty for six 
straight games. 

Even if that is the case, it will be exciting 
watching all of the other teams compete for 
second place. '

PlROlKlMVERSITY 



Miami, and Maryland to name just a few, are 
all solid teams. UCLA, North Carolina. 
Kentucky, and Syracuse have fallen off a bit 
this year, but always play well in the tourne&gt; . 

You will hear the term "Cinderella" a thou- 
sand times too many, but someone, ranked "4 
will sneak up and make the Final Four. 

A team you've never heard of, with a ter- 
rible nickname, will make the "Sweet Sixteen" 
(a term you'll hear ten thousand times). 



Maybe you'll pick enough teams to win 
the SSSS, when it's all said and done, and it's 
even possible that Indiana will win more than 
one game. I don't expect them to. but I'll 
probably pick them anyway. 

Hoosier fans are disillusioned like that. 
No matter how it turns out. it will be fun to 
watch, as always. I'll leave you with one 
depressing thought. Duke has only one 
senior — now try to enjoy the tournament.

Mountain Biking. ..To the Extreme 



Imagine yourself barreling down a 
mountain at sixty-five miles an hour, or 
trekking hundreds of miles across a mountain 
range, or going head to head against ferrious 
competition. This is all part of the sport of 
mountain biking. 

Mountain biking, a sport that is only 
twenty years old, has gone from small begin- 
nings to full Olympic sport status. The sport 
started out as a few roadbike racers just rid- 
ing their old cruiser bikes down a trail. Then 
it started to take off, starting in southern 
California, spreading across the country and 
then the world. 

There are four major disciplines in 
mountain biking. These are cross country. 
downhill, dual slalom, and observed trial. 

All of these disciplines are great fun, 
but my personal favorite is the cross-country- 
event. During the summer you can see me 
driving all over going to these races. Cross- 
country racing requires skills from all the dif- 
ferent parts of mountain bike racing to be 
successful, along with great endurance. One 
second you could be flying down a steep hill, 
then the next second you could be giving 
your all climbing back up the same steep hill. 
Doing this may not seem hard, but that is just 
the tip of the iceberg. 

Riding up and down hills isn't that hard 
all by yourself, but when you add about thir- 
ty other people battling for the same position 
that you want it gets really brutal. Then on 
top off all that you must contend with, the 
narrow trails, large trees, and other changing 
trail conditions. As an example of how rough 
and challenging a race could be, I will tell you 
about a race I was in last summer. 

This race was going as usual for me, trav- 
eling down the trail, and then I saw this guy 
coming from behind very fast, So I let him 
pass. This was early in the race so 1 figured 



he would run out of gas soon enough, and I 
would see him later. 

Then it started to rain, and I really mean 
rain, like cats and dogs. I kept going but 
slowed down because the rain had made the 
course very' slippery. Then I approached the 
most extreme part of the course, BLOODY 
GORGE. This thirty-foot, almost straight down 
drop off, had earned its name over the years, 
claiming at least four collarbones in the last 
three years. 

As I reached this section, I ran down it, 
knowing that it was too slippery for me to 
ride. Then I just keep trudging on in the rain 
wondering about the guy that had passed me 
earlier. I went on to finish the race with a 
respectable time, considering the conditions 
that day. 

The only thing was I never saw the guy 
that passed me again. Then as I was walking 
to the starter tent 1 looked inside the EMS 
truck that had been there in case anyone got 
hurt, and there lay the guy that passed me. 
He was on a stretcher and wearing a neck 
brace. 

He had gone down "BLOODY GORGE" too 
fast, trying to make up time and had a really 
bad crash, breaking his arm, and collar bone. 
This doesn't happen often but it is a grave 
reminder of what could happen to me every 
time I go out on the trail. 

As you can see, mountain biking is a fun 
sport, requiring lots of skill, practice, and a 
little luck. It has gained popularity and 
become very available to many people in this 
country. Mountain biking is everywhere, 
from riding to the park, to hanging it out on 
a downhill run at great speeds. If you are 
interested in trying this sport, check out

American Mountain Biking, or just send me
