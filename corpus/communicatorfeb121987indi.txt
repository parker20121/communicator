$1.2 million animal care facility 

Experimentation, research begin 




1)01 (.LAS WAHTZOK 



If J JOHN MctiAL'LEV 
Chief fteporlcr 



rarly fivi 



lonths 



after its 



IPFW's Life Sciences 
Resources Center, the new animal care 
facility has begun operation. 

Despite the fact that the new facility 
has yet to become completely 
operational. Biology Deparlment 
Chairman Dr Douglas Warlzbk" feets " 
the facility is "nearly a thousand 
percent " improved over Ihe facilities 
previously available lo sludenls and 

In the past, Ihe only on-campus 
facility dedicated to animal research 
was a temporary office module 
(THOMi which, according lo WarUok. 
had been in use since the campus 
opened and had been judged 
■'inadequate for a number of years". 
The TROM was not equipped for 
surgery, and according lo a spokesman 
for the physical plant, "didn't even 
come close" lo meeting slate and 
federal regulations governing such 
research. 

ThenewSl.24 million facility, located 
North of Keltler Hall, is slruclurally 
complete, but some equipment has yet 
to be received, preventing complete 
use of Ihe building's features. However, 
Wartzok said, Ihe facility should be 
fully e&lt;[Uipped by Ihe end of this 
semester. Autoclaves and food han- 
dling equipment haven't been received 



After entering the building, visitors 
first pass the office of facility 
caretaker Caria Barrett and a staff 
lounge. Next are locker and washroom 
facilities for researchers using the 
building. Located adjacent lo the locker 
rooms are preoperative, operating, 
and post-operative recovery rooms. 
These rooms are nol currently in use, 
due to their ineomplelion. 

Located down one hallway are five 
laboratories, each equipped lo handle 
toxic chemicals. 

Another hallway houses three 
isolation rooms which support newly 
received animals. Once received, the 
animals are quarantinediand inspected 
in these rooms to insure tliey are free of 
contaminalion. This assures resear- 
chers that new animals are not 
carrying diseases which may be 
transmitted to other animals housed in 
the building. 

One entrance to the building is a 
receiving dock for all deliveries. Im- 
mediately adjacent lo the receiving 
dock IS a cage washing facility com- 
posed of a "dirty" and "clean" side. 
Animal holding cages which are being 
processed for reuse or being received 
from trte manufaclUrer are initially 
broughl into the washing facilily 
through Ihe "dirty " side, where 
cleanliness is not important. After 
being sent through a large, stainless 
steel washing machine, the cages are 
received on the "clean" side of the 
room, where contaminalion can be kept 
lo a minimum. Cage cleanliness is 
important lo researchers because of the 
possibility of transmitting disease from 
one animal lo the-next occupant of thai 
same cage. 

Near the cage washing facilily is a 
room dedicated to processing food for 
the animals. This room is outfitted with 
mixers, blenders, sinks and will receive 
refrigerators and freezers before 



Although the Animal Care Facilily 
isn"l complete, some researchers have 
already begun work in the building. 

The only animals currently housed in 
the building are a colony of more than 
two hundred rats and two black and off- 
while puppies, 

Thebulkof the rat population is being 
utilized for preventive dentistry

Everybody get 'footloose 7 

BySTACEYSCHAAB 
Staff Writer 

Sludenls have the opportunity to learn of foreign lands and their culture 
through folk dancing. 

Zoe Caron-Spinks and her husband Gerry Spinks are co-leaders of the fn- 
ternalional Folk Dancers, a group that meets every week at IPFW to learn tlie 
dances ol nations in addition to the United Stales. The Spinks offer the people 
who attend the sessions some basic instructions, as well as a short history of the 
origin of each dance they leach. 

Spinks and her husband have been offering Ihesessions since last fall. Anyone 
IS welcome to attend — students, faculty or staff. 

The dancers meet on Thursday nights from 7:30-10 p.m. in Walb Memorial 
Union Building. 

The dances taught are from all over the world — France, Greece, Italy, 
Macedonia, Bulgaria, Hungary, England and America, 




This little crealurc is one of over 200 rals being kepi in the Life Sciences Resource

research which involves feeding the 
rats a sugar water solution to induce 
tooth decay Researchers then clean 
the animal's leeth with different 
materials to determine which are most 
effective in the prevention of cavities. 
Other rats are being used for 
psychology research involving the 
effects of differing day and night cycles 
on behavior. 

Une project will result in the 
deslruction of Ihe young dogs housed in 
the building, Wartzok said the dogs are 
destined tor use in physiology classes

blood from the heart. He also 
predicled last week Ihal they would 
"probably only be alive for a few more 
days." The rats will also be destroyed 
lo make possible the removal of their 
leeth for examination. 

Wartzok disclosed some future 
research plans for the new. facility. 



Approval has been rec-eived for a 
project in which cats will have elec- 
trodes implanled in their bodies which 
will enable researchers lo study the 
interaction between adrenal hormones 
ladrcnalini and behavior. One animal 
room is being outfitted to support pigs 
dial will be broughl in for research into 
how vitamins are melatx)lized in the 
bottom of, the stomach. Pigs are used 
for this type of research because of 
their internal similarities lo humans. 
Approval is being sought in which 
rabbits will be used lo study the im- 

As the new facility becomes fully 
operational, Wartzok said the guiding 
philosophy behind planning for the 
future is that the new facility should 
never be full. He said that space should 
always be available for new resear- 
chers lo undertake projects as they

In an expansion of the development staff of IPFW, David R. Skelton has been 
named associate director of university development. 

Skelton. the former IPFW director of athletics. wUI work with Leonard P, 
laquinU. director of development. laquinia joined the IPFW faculty and stalf last 
fall as Ihe director of development. 

Skelton's role will expand his fund-raising focus to include not only athletics but 
also work on campus-wide development projects. He will continue to leach in the 
department of edueolion, 

Arnie Ball, assistant director of athletics, will serve as acting director of in- 
lercollegiale, intramural and recreational programs. 

In making Ihe announcement, Chancellor Thomas P. Wallace said, "Wilh 
(Skt-Uon'si involvement in development, we will be able to build an even stronger 
fund-raising program, 

"Planned expansion of our universily advancement program must include 
adequate altenlion to fund-raising activities supporting the number of student 
athletes competing for IPFW in NCAA Division II athletics." Wallace said. "We'll 
put (Skelton'si experience to good use in both IPFW athletics and the overall 
development program " 

"I'm also confident that Arnie will be as excellent at managing our athletics 
programs as he has been at coaching our volleyball teams," Wallace said of Ball's 
move.

Students fail to use 
career skills seminars 



What IS Ihc most commonly heard 
statement on campus'' "I can't wait 'lil I 
graduate and can get on with my 
career," But what is the student body of 
IPFW doing to prepare themselves for 
that inevitable day'' 

Basically, not much on exercising 
skills on resumes, interviewing, and 
basic workshop techniques. Evidently 
some of us are still living with the mylh 
that all we need is a college education to 
find a job today. Well, we all need to 
wake up and smell the coffee. Not only 
do you need a degree today, but you also 
need to have skills at creating 
impressions: a favorable one that is, 

How many students realize that 
resume, and interviewing skills are only 
a few hours away? A few free sessions 
with the IPFW Placement Service will 
help give the skills needed to gel your 
foot in the door of Ihc career you've 
chosen. 

Everyone knows how to write a 
resume, right'.' And of course, all you 
need to do is dress nice, be on lime, be 
polite, and the interview will go great, 
right? Wrong, Students are not prepared 
to enter the job market today and it's 
due to the lack of effort on our part. The 
Placement Service offers workshops 
during the year on resume writing and 
interviewing techniques Again, these 
sessions are free to all IPFW students. 

There are roughly 1350 to 1400 students 
graduating from IPFW per year Of 
these, only 208 students are currently 
enrolled al the placement service office. 
These numbers show that roughly 1200 
students may not be prepared for the job 
search process. 

Comments from the businesses that 
have conducted on-campus recruiting 
vary; "does not have well defined 
goals", "could elaborate more on some 
answers; felt 1 needed to push for 
information, " "not much drive or 
enthusiasm," "answers to interviewer's 
questions somewhat vague," "did not 
ask enough questions about the position 
or the company," "needs to identify a 
little more as to where he is going and 
how to achieve his goals." "did not 



I 



;&gt; 



respond well to questions asked by 

interviewer," "communication ability 

— especially over the phone — is my big 

concern," "needs more self assurance — 

loo much of the same old stuff — I like 

people, and am a people person." There 

are the interviewing downfalls of the 

IPFW student body. But how many 

students actually gel that far'' 
Only 146 people i students and alumni&gt; 

were picked for interviewing with 

companies recruiting at IPFW. What 

determines if you are going to be picked 

for interviewing? Your resume. There 

were a total of 540 people enrolled with 

placement services as of Feb 10 The 

odds are not too great for being chosen 

Evidently the resumes are not up to 

professional level. 
What are you going to do to ready 

yourself for the job hunf Hopefully, you 

are going to give your friendly 

placement service a call. 
What about the students that don't feel 

lliese skills are needed as they are 
already working in the field of their 
choice^ Don't forget that if you ever 
want to move up in your organization 
you slill have to pass the interview. If 
someone from the outside can make a 
belter impression, who do you think the 
company will pick? Also, what if later in 
life you wish to change companies'' Your 
resume and interview skills better be up 
lo par. 

There are statistics thai a potential "I 
don't need the placement service" 
person ought lo know. People change 
careers as many as 3-5 times and may 
change jobs as many as 6-10 times. 

Come on student body! Wake up. Give 
the placement service a try You have 
nothing lo lose, and only something lo 
learn. The staff al placement services 
will leach you skills to use time and 
again whether you're looking for a part- 
time job, a summer job, a co-op position, 
trying lo obtain a position, looking to 
move up in a company, or to just get that 
entry level job They can also help you ~p, 
change companies or careers II is a free OonHnCntary 
service, and it is available to us all. St — ^-^^^^— ^^^^—

REMEMIER ALL VOUR VALENTINES! 




iSUBOGj Chairperson, 
represented Students' 
Government during last 
week's DRPC''"meMing»- 
Schlueler said thai 

presently, Ihe UKPC is 
considering two important 
campus policy changes, one 

smoking on campus, while 
the olher has to do with 
campus parking 

1 An anti-smoking policy 
change is Iwing discussed 
among URPC memliers. 
Many dilferent ideas have 
been tossed around, ranging 
in degree from "'no smoking 
in IPFW buildings" to 
"designated smoking lor 
designated non-smoking) 
areas," 

Al first, designated 
smoking, or designated non- 
smoking areas might sound 
like a fair compromise. 
Although such a proposal 
sounds simple enough, 
problems might arise. Take 
Ihe 2&gt;l-hour library lounge for 
instance. The lounge is 
really too small lo divide 
into smoking and non- 
smoking sections eftettively

Who's right, who is wrong? 
Consider that ' jkers are 
already restr.cted from 
smoking in most areas of 
IPFW campus buildings. In 
fact, inltaling smoke 
passively has l&gt;een cautioned 
against by the Surgeon 
General as contributing to 
the development of iung 

Nonetheless, I can't help 
but notice that a great 
numberof the students that I 
see on campus studying, are 
smoking. The pojnl is that a 
lot of people around this 
campus smoke But a lot of 
.^opledon'tsmoke, HowtCan 
these two segments of our 
population coexist? 

2. The second issue that 
ORPC is mulling over, is a 
change in several of the 
restricted parking areas. 
The current proposal under 
consideration reads like 
this: The tot between Neff 
Hall and the CM building, 
which IS now one-half B and 
one-half A-unly i until after 
5:30 p.m when the entire lot 
isA-Bi. would be changed to 
A-only parking 24 liours. The 
parking meters on ihe east 
side of the SI Joe River lot 
would be uprooted (those 
spots would become B 24 
hours). The meters would be 
placed on the soulli side ol 
Ihe lot between Neff and CM, 

The next change would 
involve Ihe lot directly south 
of the Helmke Library, and 
the lot SDUtheasI of Keltler 
Hall ilotSJ, Both the library 
lol and lol 9 would slay A- 
only during the day, but 
change lo A-B parking after 
5 3U pin.

Consider Ihe results of the 
above-oullmed changes: One 
argument is itial pedestrian 
safety between Neff and CM 
would be improved because 
traffic in that lot would be 
reduced Another argument 
IS that visitors (parked at 
meters I would not have to 
walk as far us they would if 
they were restricted to 
parking along the river 

Perhaps a more important 
consideration is the night- 
lime parking situation Last 
Students' 
?nl (Student 



Senate) acted upon a student 
complaint and passed a 
resolulion which called for 
an "after 5:30 p.m." change 
in Ihe A-only library lol. We 
requested a change lo A-B 
parkmg in the library lol 
after 5:30 p.m. based on the 
grounds that students 
studying late al night should 
be able lo walk the shortest 
distance possible lo their 
cars for safety's sake. 

Finally, anolher change is 
in the works. Student Senate 
has passed a resolution 
ig the expansion of 



[he Helmke Library hours,. 
Students' Government will 
recommend a proposal to 
Chancellor Thomas Wallace,

As springUmc neara. the

Surely, when Valentine's 
Day is the occasion, tlus is 
doubly true Is it any won- 
der? Local department 
stores liave been cheerfully 
displaying their brightly 
colored cards and heart 
shaped candies for nearly a 
month now Yet many of us 
will be at a loss as to what to

any lack ol forethought, of

that one universal thought 
that lurhs in the back ot 
everyone's mind at this time 



ofyear "What can I gel her 
lor him' that she will really 
like and remember?" 

Some unusual Valentine 
gift ideas arc based on old 
standards. Many florists for 
example, as well as many 
novelty shops, have begun 
carrying such items as 
balloon bouquets and stuffed 
animals along with their 
usual selection of flower 
arrangements. Another 
variation on a standard 
theme is the personalized 
Valentine card Here, one 
not only has the opporlunjty 
1o choose a particular style 
of card, but also to deter- 
mine to a great extent what 



the card says. Through one 
local company, "Words of 
l^ve ". a person can actually 
have poetry tailor-made for 
their specific Valentine. 

A really unique Valentine 
gift whose time has come is 
the singing telegram. There 
are a variety of types 
available throughout Ft 
Wayne, covering the spec- 
trum from the subtle to 
outrageous. I.P F.W.'s own 
music department, for 
example, sells singing 
telegrams each February lo 
benefit their Music Therapy 
division. For "just a song", 
one can have a Valentine 
message delivered, by 



telephone, lo that special 
someone There are several 
greetings to choose from, 
some humorous, some 
romanlic; each is put to the 
tunc of a different popular 
song. 

Sometimes the presen- 
tation of a Valentine 
message can become a 
memorable part of the gift 
itself Several local balloon 
and novelty companies offer 
personal deliveries by your 
choice of one of several 
costumed characters 
"Swectcakes Co." for in- 
stance, has a popular 
character called the Comedy 
Gorilla, This ralher dapper 



looking ape is often seen 
wearing burmuda shorls. a 
bright lie and sunglasses 
The presentation, which can 
come with a full bouquet of 
balloons, gifts, and a 
Valentine card, includes a 



comedy routine. Clowns are 
also very popular. The 
"Sweelcakes" clown, in fact. 
has been sought out several 
times to present Valentine's 
Day wedding proposals.

Billy Joel: little time for all hits 



By KKEIAUD JOHNSON 
Staff Writer 

The opening strains of 
Gershwin's "Rhapsody in 
Blue" thundered in In- 
dianapolis as Market Square 
Arena became enveloped in 
darkness Tlien. suddenly, a 
guilar-toting Billy Joel 
rushed on stage jamming out 
his Tirsl guitar-written hit 'A 
Matter ot Trust ' 

Billy Joel's "The Bridge" 
World Tour 1986-87 concert in 
Indy may well have been one 
of the greatest events of the 
year for Ihis slate 



Review 



My readers may complain 
thai the upcoming Bon Jovi 
concert will be better, but I 
parry \Mth the question: Can 
Bon Jovi fill a two-plus hour 
concert witli monster hits 



lur, at least, ones you've 
heard before i? Or could 
Genesis boast a 360 degree 
field ot view ot the stage with 
eventual lace-on per- 
formances to all sides? Billj 
Joel did both, with east. 

From the throbbing beat ot 
•'Ifs Still Rock and Boll to 
Me" and the thundering 
choppers of 'Goodnight 
Saigon" to the delicate 
chords ot his latest hit "This 
IS Ihe Time," his music was 
performed flawlessly. 

The "Piano Man" joked 
witli his audience and told ol 
a toolb;ill game he and his 
band had with "John 
Mellencamp's boys." The 
phrase, "and we got our 
(butts) kicked," was lent 
credibility as John Cougar 
Mellencamp himself was in 
attendance drawing 



recognition trom the wired 
Market Square crowd. 

"It's lime to get serious 
now," he said as he sat down 
at his ebony Vamaha concert 
grand, "this song is about 
sometlung we all care a lol 
about' Then, as he broke 
into the opening phrase ot 
"Unly the Good Die Young," 
the audience jolled lo their 
feet never to find their seats 
again imtil he closed his 
third encore forty-five 
minutes later with "Tell Her 
About II." 

The only disappointment 
was he didn't have enough 
time lo play all ot his hits. 
Among those missed were 
"Just the Way You Are " and 
"My Life." 

The question remains — 
will he return in April? We 
can only wait and see. If he 



does, il would be a worthy 
invcslmenl to go to Indy to 
see him. 

And so, for all of us who 
asked him lo "play us a 
song" fourteen years ago in 
"Piano Man," Billy Joel 
fulfilled our wishes on 
Feb. H

LeBlanc explains Reynard in 
the following statement: 
"The epic ot Reynard does 
not exist as one work; it 
comprises an international 
body ot literature which 
dates from 1150 to 1500 A.D. 
He IS the clever, unmoral 
rebel against authority, the 
antithesis of what is still 
understood today as an 'old 
fox', crafty and 

dissimulating. Personally, 
Reynard represents an alte- 
vego present in all."

media artwork until 
February 28, Afterwards, 
she said she would like lo

consistent." 

Having compiled an 8-5 
record and a (ourtcenlh spot 
in Ihe national rankings, Ihe 
Icam boasts a variety of 
good qualilies. "Blocking is 
one of our slrongest areas," 
according to Ball. "Al times 
our offense has been good, 
with Jay Goldsteyn and Ted 
Owen, and when we pass. 

However, various im- 
provements are necessary 
lor Ihe Mastodons, in llieir 
yoimg season. "We lack 
consistency, and we need to 
work on the back court and 
serving," Ball assesses. 

Kramer also sees 
cohe^iveness as a point to 
amend. "We need to improve 
Durability to play as a team. 
It was starling to come 
around in Ihe Fori Wayne 
National Bank classic," 
Kramer states. "But the 
synergy hasn't been there 
since the Ohio State match." 

An important contest is

liccause it is so close, and

Ball says. "If we can get
