Records and admissions 



OPINION 



the 



; and providing tutoring for students who need 



Now, there seems to be some kind of controversy on campus ai 
Division of Records and Admissions primarily serves students ( 
specifically, the issue comes down ti 
by the student dean c 



to whether this 
• faculty. More 
whether this division should be administered 
&gt; faculty dean. 
; majority of the faculty members of the Ad Hoc Joint Faculty Steering 
Committee (AHJFSCi. the answer is obvious: the services performed are 
primarily academic; therefore the service is primarily for faculty, therefore the 
division should report to the dean of faculties. 

The services are certainly academic In nature, but they are not performed 
exclusively for the faculty's benefit. In every case, the functions of the division 
directly affect the students, while the effect on faculty is not quite so direct. 
Records are not kept on graduated students for the benefit of the faculty, and the 
veterans office serves faculty only very indirectly. 

On the other hand, it would be impossible to demonstrate how students are so 
removed from the division's activities, 

But the faculty continue to cry that the division is not accountable to Lhem 
while it is administered through student services. Only if "their" dean, so the 
faculty reason, cm order t he direct or oi I lie division around will they be sure of the 
division's work being done properly. 

But not once did a f:uully member of AII.IKSC voice concern over the division 
being accountable to students II an office foul-up during registration causes some 
class cards lo be losl it is a student, nolo professor, who must alter his schedule If 
the V A loses a G.I, Bill check, it is a student, not a professor, who has to live 
without the money If the wrong transcript is sent to a prospective employer, It Is a 
student, not a professor, who stands lo lose the job. 

Under the present system, a student can go In the dean of student services for 
help in resolving these problems Will a dean of laeullies take I lie time to help the 
many students who surely will be facing these and other problems? 

Hardly. 

Problems like these are why ll'i'VV has a dean of student services the student 
services people have an excellent track record in keeping their house clean. They 
have worked miracles lileraUy-wilh a registration system thai has no business 
working at all, except that half of it pleased Bloominglon and the other half 
Lafayette. 

Rightfully so, they enjoy the complete respect ol nearly every student leader 
who has worked lo improve the position ol students at this campus. 

Moving record' I admissions from student services to academic affairs can 

only cause deterioration in the level of concern and service now afloi (led students 
The chancellor will commit a very grave injustice if lie allows such a deterioration 



Athletics on campus 

For the past .several years there lias been a considerable amount of debate In 
this country concerning the position of sports programs In academic settings. 
There are good arguments for both escalating and curtailing athletic activities. 
Each particular case must be viewed from the proper perspective. 

Starting in grode school, many children are relentlessly pressured by parents 
and teachers to compete against others in sporting events Unfortunately, the 

emphasis is all I, (I en on defeating someone ralhei than participating for the fun 

of it. This process builds until the lime I he student reaches college, athletics hove 
been transformed into a lug business, and the individual participant becomes a 
part of the machinery of a business program. 

Obviously, this occurs mostly on larger college campuses, but the "winning is 
everything" axiom has become a part of almost every college athlete's life. 

Athletic programs can and should be an integral pari of every educalional 
environment The individual is offered many rewarding opportunities through 
part id pat me. 10 organizations such as intramural sports New aei|uaintances are 
made, health is improved, and a sense of belonging is gained. 

Intercollegiate sports have their place also, bill is is in this area that the 
concept of playing for enjoyment is most oil en lost Sports are used as a yardstick 
e the worth of schools. Star athletes are pampered and looked up to as 
better than olhers Many of them are so wrapped up in sports that they 
graduate. II these sports hemes fail to make the grade in the pros, what is left for 

These problems may seem far from relevant to IPFW, where there is hardly 
t on sports But the same problems can plague programs on a 
smaller scale 

Keeping these thoughts in mind, any proposed athletic facility should 

"c support of all students An athletic complex on the IPFW campus 
would not seem out of place in the not-too-distant future.

With the coming of the new year, it is important 
for us to reassess our individual values and our 
relationships with the people and institutions with 
which we are dependent. Indiana University-Purdue 
University has been able to maintain the quality of its 
academic programs because you have demanded and 
worked for high standards. 

It is important that you do not settle for any 
substitutes for the highest quality education that can 
be provided in the State of Indiana. It is my pledge to 
you that quality education will not be compromised at 
the Fort Wayne Campus. 

On behalf of the staff of Indiana University-Pur- 
due University at Fort Wayne, I would like to extend 
to each of you a happy and joyous holiday season and 
a prosperous and fulfilling new year. I look forward 
to your continued cooperation and support for future 
endeavors to enhance our academic objectives.
