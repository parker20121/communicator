Dilemma: how best to reach this 
situated across campus. 
J drive over to Kettler, but 
no guarantee of a parking

foot, but the weather doesn't al- 
ways cooperate. Who wants to 
tramp that distance in sub-freezing 
temperatures or gale force winds 
or rain or snow 9 Another alter- 
native is a phone call, but you dig 
deep into your pockets or purse and 
find out you have no change nor
