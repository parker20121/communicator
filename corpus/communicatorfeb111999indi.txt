New plus/minus grading system 
gives professors choice 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
Chiel Reporter 

Despite the fears of some stu- 
dents about tlie status of their 
grades, the new plus/minus grad- 
ing system approved Monday by 
the Faculty Senate will not impact 
grades that have already been 
assigned. 

An "A" will still be worth four 
points, a "B" worth three, a "C" 
worth two and a "D" worth one. 
The plus/minus grades will be 
somewhere in between; for e.\am- 
ple, an "A-" will be worth 3.7. 

"Some professors will be 



happy lo go to a plus minus sys- 
tem and others won't be," said 
Michael Wartell, chancellor. "Our 
professors will be free to do either 
grading sjstem." 

Indiana University in 
Bloomington is using the 
plus/minus grading system and 
now IPFW faculty will also be able 
to assign grades in this more dis- 
tinct manner. 

However, the faculty is not 
being forced to use it and may do 
so only if individuals chose. 

"What students should be 
concerned about is whether their 
particular professor grades them 
fairl)' and 1 haven't heard very 



many complaints about that," 
Wartell said. 

The new grading process is 
not expected to go into effect 
until the 2000-2001 school year 
at the earliest, according to Carl 
Drummond. associate professor of 
geosciences, and Faculty Senate 
member. 

Wartell believes that there is 
nothing to worry about, 

"Change is hardâ€” it's hard for 
facult)' and it's hard for students 
and it's hard for administration," 
Wartell said. "But I don't really 
see anything to be frightened of 
at this point." 



Purdue faculty settle on 
new grievance procedure 



by CarrieAnne Lealtiers, 
Chief Reporter 

Due to a change in the previous procedure 
for filing grievances at Purdue University 
West Lafayette, faculty members and 
administrators at IPFW must now hold 
hearings without representation, 

"From both sides, it takes away," said 
Jeffrey Wilson, professor of psychologj' and chair of 
the grievance board. 

"We are happy about the elimination of attor- 
neys but unhappy that representation in general is 
no longer allowed," Wilson said. 

According to Chancellor Wartell, other Purdue 
University locations were not bothered by the new 
executive memorandum's exclusion of 
represenution. 

However, without any representation, facult&gt;' 
members who may feel very emotional about the sit- 
uation must speak on their own behalf, even though 
it could impair their ability to present in the 



hearing. 

"The new procedure at least allows the griev- 
ance to be heard, but it allows them to be heard in a 
way that is likely to be more stressful to the facult&gt;' 
member grieving than was the old procedure," 
Wilson said. 

In between the old procedure ending and the 
new procedure being developed and accepted, 
Purdue faculty at IPFW were completely without a 
way to file grievances. This occurred during the fall 
semester of 1998. 

According to Wilson, the facultj' is at least glad 
that there is a procedure back in place and also that 
attorneys are no longer invoked in the process since 
representation is no longer allowed. 

"First, when attorneys are present, it makes it 
more of a court room setting and it is not meant to 
be a court proceeding," Wilson said. "Secondly, there 
are scheduling issues because attorneys are often 
very busy and scheduling a hearing can be very dif- 
ficult between faculty and attorney schedules."

IPFW FundinQ- Problems persist, answers fortlicoming 



by Mistianna Wood, 

News Editor, 

and Ben Ruble, 

Staff Writer 

Enrollment increases 
to change FTE funding 

Although equity funding is 
down, the spring of 1999 has begun 
with at least one positive note for 
IPFW. Enrollment numbers have car- 
ried from last semester. 

According to a memorandum 
written by Chancellor Michael 
Wartell, credit hour production was 
87,411 last spring and is now 
89,264. 

"We were up in the fall semester 
by the same number of credit hours. 
When &gt;ou look at enrollment by aca- 
demic unit, we're carrying students 
from fall to spring," Frank Borelli, 
vice chancellor of Student Affairs, 
said. 

Full-time enrollment of under- 
graduate and graduate students has 
increased from 4,357 last spring 
semester to 4,519 this spring 
semester. 



The number of freshmen, both 
full-time and part-time, has gone up 
from 3,605 last spring to 3,739 this 
spring. 

Part-time enrollment of under- 
graduate and graduate students has 
decreased from 5,563 in the spring 
of '98 to 5.378 in spring of "99. 

The School of Education, and 
departments of chemistry, computer 
science, management and marketing, 
music, political science, communica- 
tion and English and linguistics have 
higher numbers as well. 

"It's a whole lot better to have 
increases than decreases. Dr. Borelli 
and various committees have been 
working. I hope that students are 
more satisfied," Wartell said. 

Student satisfaction is one fac- 
tor that has increased along with 
enrollment- 

In the 1998 Student Satisfactory 
Survey, student satisfaction exceed- 
ed national limits in II out of 12 
categories. 

Satisfaction is high and enroll- 
ment is up. 

Therefore IPFW should receive 
more funds. 

In the next biennium, 2001, this 
campus should obtain more money 
due to the Hoosier FTE (Full-Time 
Equivalent). 



Full-Time Equivalent is a mea- 
sure that tries to describe the school 
in a standardized wa\ and eliminates 
the differences that are based on 
full-time and part-time enrollment 
combined, said Jack Dahl, associate 
vice-chancellor of institutional 
research and planning. 

"We've had an increase of 2.2 
percent. This will have an impact on 
funding per student The enrollment 
change form the state uses looks at 
total enrollment over a period of 
years and changes in the levels of 
enrollment," Dahl said. 

According to Walt Branson, vice 
chancellor of Financial Affairs, the 
FTE rises S2,000 when enrollment 
goes up. The state recommends to 
lower funds S3, 000 per student 
when it goes down. 

The FTE counts five part-time 
students as one full-time student tak- 
ing 15 credit hours, 

IPFW will lose 5400,000 next 
year due to low enrollment in the 
pasL In 2001 the money will come 
back. 

"The money goes toward many 
things," Branson said. 

Dahl said the money will go to 
an area that needs it the most when 
it arrives. 



Local lawmakers stress 
importance of increase 
in equity funding 



When questioned at the State of 
the City Address last Friday about 
IPFW's low funding, many local 
politicians appeared to be 
concerned. 

They realized that a fully-fund- 
ed IPFW is essential to the growth of 
Fort Wayne. 

"That is one of my big con- 
cerns," said Fort Wayne Mayor Paul 
Helmke. "It is ridiculous that.. .we 
don't get our fair share of money in 
Northeast Indiana, 1 talk a lot with 
Chancellor Wartell and that is one of 
the things that I continue to talk to 
our legislators about and I am going 
to continue to push for that. It is one 
of my number one concerns." 

Helmke agreed with local public 
opinion that IPFWs funding is neces- 
sary for the city to grow. 

He also said that he did not get 
a chance to mention it in his State of 
the City speech, but the funding 
problems at IPFW have come up in 
other speeches in recent years. 

Other politicians echoed the 



same sentiment as Mayor Helmke 
regarding IPFWs funding, 

"Higher Education cut the fund- 
ing," said State Senator David Long. 
"We are extremely upset about it. I 
have been an advocate for a long 
time. IPFW is treated very poorly and 
it is time that it stops. We are work- 
ing hard on doing that. Hopefully, it 
will be successful." 

Representative Mark Souder, an 
IPFW graduate, said that he is trying 
to get the point across in a more sub- 
tie manner. 

For example, Souder said he met 
recently with Dan Goldman at ITT 
and told him, "We can't compete 
nationally if our universities don't 
receive more funding for better col- 
leges in Fort Wayne." 

"Truthfully, Purdue and Indiana 
are ninth and tenth in the whole Big 
Ten. Even the parent campuses are 
struggling. Fort Wayne has to learn 
how to get more Independent like 
Indianapolis (lUPUI). They have a 
law school, a med school, and we 
have to figure out how to. I person- 
ally don't feel we should separate 
from the base affiliation, but we 
need to become more independent. 
You are fighting a funding battle this 
year, but it will never get fixed until 
we address that. Unless we fix the

Mayor Paul Helmke gives his final State 
of the City Address on Feb. 5. 



by Ben Ruble, 
Staff Writer 



Fort Wayne Mayor Paul 
Helmke delivered his final State of 
the City address at a packed ban- 
quet lunch held at the Grand 
Way ne Center last Friday. 

Mayor Helmke concentrated 
on the accomplishments of his 
tenure as mayor of the city over 
the last 11 years. 

Since Mayor Helmke opted to 
not run for what is considered an 
unprecedented fourth term as 
mayor, 1999 will be his final year 



in the Mayor's Office. 

This makes Friday's State of 
the City address his final one. 

Helmke addressed many posi- 
tive changes that have taken place 
during his tenure. 

Many of the accomplishments 
from 1998 were noted in the 
Mayor's speech, including a 2.5 
percent unemployment rate {con- 
siderably below the state and 
national averages), a S90 million 
sewer capacity upgrade and the 
new Animal Care &amp; Control Shelter 
facility, on top of property tax 
rates that declined to S3. 35 per 
SI 00. 

ReliaSiar Financial 

Corporation, based in Minneapolis, 
ranked Fort Wayne and the sur- 
rounding metropolitan area as the 
second-best metropolitan area in 
the country for financial 
security. 

The overall ranking reflects 
the corporation's ranking of the 
city in such areas as cost-of-living. 



unemployment rate, and crime 
rate. 

In 12 of 15 areas, Fort Wayne 
ranked in the top thirty out of the 
125 largest metropolitan areas. 

Helmke and his administration 
also helped land Fort Wayne an All- 
America City aw ard. Programs 
tike Community-Oriented 

Government, which allows and 
encourages citizens to be more 
active and have a voice in govern- 
ment, along with low crime rates. 
great financial success and a num- 
ber of other positive community 
influences led to this prestigious 
award. 

After discussing his adminis- 
tration's accomplishments, Helmke 
ouUined his plans for 1999. 

"Some might look at my last 
year in office as a 'lame duck' year. 
Don't count on it. 1 have a lot to 
accomplish in 1999 and now I 
would like to outline three goals." 
said the Mayor. 

The Major's first goal men- 



tioned funding for the Dalman 
Road extension. 

"We've got a great airport that 
we've put a lot of money into, but 
simply put, you can't get there 
from here." 

This project would cut the dis- 
tance to 1-69 from the Fort Wayne 
International Airport from 10 miles 
to three miles. 

This would be an added conve- 
nience to airport passengers who 
are outside the city and would be 
helpful for the new air trade park 
located near the airpon:. 



Mayor Helmke's second goal 
regards plans for expanding the 
Grand Wayne Center.

TOPIC: 

Castration 

WHAT WE THINK: 

Why would anyone 
want to be 
castrated? 



by Daddy Hidayat Jong-Edllorial Cartoonist 



After hearing of a 
Huntington man who allegedly 
performed castrations without 
a license to practice medicine, 
the subject has been a diffi- 
cult one to avoid. 

What would possess a man 
to allow himself to be mutilat- 
ed in this manner? We have 
come up with a few ideas. 

The most logical reason 
for a man to have an opera- 
lion on his reproductive 
organs would be to make it so 
he could no longer impregnate 
a woman. 

If a man wanted to pre- 
vent ever having children, 
there are many other options 
to consider before castration. 
There are currently several 
ways for this to be taken care 
of, including having a vasecto- 
my, a surgical procedure that 
cuts the vas deferens and pre- 
vents the flow of semen from 
the testicles. This outpatient 
surgery doesn't even require 
general anesthesia. In addi- 
tion, there are too many other 
less in\asive options to con- 
sider for birth control. 

This brings us to another 
possible answer to the ques- 
tion of why someone would 
want to be castrated. Possibly, 
he wouldn't want to be a man 



anymore and have a sex 
change. Some doctors say that 
if a man were to have his tes- 
ticles removed there would be 
a deficiency of testosterone in 
the body, much like a woman 
going through menopause, 
which some people may find 
appealing. Someone who was- 
n t able to come up with the 
money for a sex change might 
be interested in an illegal 
operation. 

If you were to go far 
enough to remove your testi- 
cles, though, why wouldn't 
you also remove your penis? 
The penis is actually more 
representative of manhood 
than the testicles. Why not 
remove them all at the same 
lime? We have seen people on 
the Jerry Springer show who 
have done it. 

Another answer we came 
up with is more spiritual in 
nature. Many of you may 
remember the Heaven's Gate 
cult whose members commit- 
ted suicide a while back in 
California. As far as we can 
remember, many of the cult 
members were 
castrated. 

Religions 
have a unique 
way of making 
people do 
things that 
aren't attempted 
by society as a 
whole, such as 
having believ- 
ers handle poiso- 
nous snakes. 
Since many reli- 
gions see sex as 
evil or the root of 
many evils, a 
connection can 
be drawn to 
removing the 
reproductive 



organs; by removing the 
organs, they remove the evil. 

Some have voiced their 
opinion that those who had 
the illegal surgeries per- 
formed in Huntington may 
have had a form of testicular 
cancer. If the people feared 
the cancer they could have 
gone to a licensed specialist 
and used or found a source of 
money or insurance to have 
the operation done safely. 

Another demented reason 
for going through with the 
genital mutilation is to fulfill 
some sexual fantasy. For years 
men have been doing things 
like choking themselves, cut' 
ting themselves, and perform- 
ing other types of sado 
masochistic activities to gain 
sexual pleasure. We're not 
saying that the men 
Huntington did this, but it is a 
possibility. 

Whatever the reasons 
motivating the men who 
allowed their manhood to be 
removed, none of them seem 
to be truly legitimate.

of the 
masses."

Prison Funding 



Governor O' Bannon: 

This letter is in regards to the 
senseless millions requested by the 
Indiana Department of Correction to 
build new facilities around the state. 
Governor O' Bannon, DOC is already an 
incomprehensible juggernaut of incom- 
petenc&gt; , corruption, nepotism and 
racism. It is a snowballing mass out of 
control! 

DOC officials are playing on the 
fears of the public. Here at the State 
Prison, there are appro.ximately 800 
employees and a little over 1600 prison- 
ers; that's about an employee for every 
two(2) prisoners; ain't that much watch- 
ing the worldl DOC has de\'eloped into a 
profit motive venture. Cit&gt;' and towns 
are fighting over the establishment of 
DOC Tacilities in their area. For instance, 
here at the State Prison, prison officials 
can hire their friends and relatives, 
lovers, etc., all under the guise of need- 
ed employees. Its a joke! The system of 



slaver&gt;' reinstated all over again. 

Governor O' Bannon, PLEASE before 
you appropriate any funds for the 
expansion of DOC, appoint a committee 
to determine the unbelievable incompe- 
tence, corruption, nepotism and waste 
known as the Department of Correction. 
The corruption is so great, that prison- 
ers are forced to buy soap, toothpaste 
and toilet paper. 

Governor 0' Bannon, a special com- 
mittee b&gt; you would readily expose the 
scam of these professional crooks dis- 
guised as DOC officials. Sir, to pour 
more of the taxpayers' money into this 
scheme without investigation, would be 
to create a monster without control. 

Sir, if you would but view the orga- 
nizational structure of DOC, you would 
immediately see that a huge scam is 
underway. Blatant greed is mushroom- 
ing at such a pace, that failing to bring 
DOC under control, will create a 
Frankenstein monster that consumes us 
all. 



Governor 0' Bannon, DOC already 
has a ver&gt;' infiuential and powerful 
apparatus that reaches into e\ery court 
(state and federal), it controls and intim- 
idates social and civic organizations, 
churches, etc. Sir, DOC apparatus holds 
sway at the Office of the Attomej 
General and its vast tentacles reach into 
your office. Sir, for Indiana to have 
approximately 6 million people and 40 
prisons is a shame. 

Governor 0' Bannon, it would be 
wise and prudent to appoint a FACT 
FINDING COMMITTEE before approving 
additional funds for DOC. 

Thanks for your fine attention and 
we pray you accept our comments. 



Sincerely, 
Robert E Keeby

Commentary 



I must hate myself, because 1 was 
bom, raised and, unfortunately, learned 
how to drive in, the capital of fun. 

Have you ever been driving down 
the street, minding your own business, 
when you get about 100 feet from an 
intersection and some jerk pulls out in 
front of you, then he or she slows down 
to about half the speed that you were 
originally dolng7 

As horrible as it may sound to a 
non-native Fort Wayner. this is a more- 
than-common occurrence in this less- 
than-wonderful town. 

"Even In good weather, they're 
bad," said my communication teacher, 
who was born in our neighbor to the 
north, Michigan. He said this during the 
height of the snowstorm we had a few 
weeks ago, when even "good" Fort 
Wa&gt;'ne drivers were bad. and the "bad" 
Fort Wayne drivers were worse. 

"Weather" is any change in temper- 
ature or humidity that causes rain or 
snow or hail or ice or whatever. I felt 
that 1 should clarify what weather is 
because Fort Wayne drivers pay 
absolutely no attention to it. We could 



be considered like postal workers, 
because during rain, sleet, snow, and 
hail we drive the exact same way as we 
would if the weather were perfect. 

They taught us how to drive in 
Driver's Ed, right? Then how come we 
still drive so piss-poor? The answer is 
this: Our Driver's Ed instructors are also 
piss-poor Fort Wayne drivers. But 
nobody really learns how to drive from 
Driver's Ed an&gt;-way: we all learn from 
watching our parents drive. I can vouch 
that my mother is the personification of 
Fort Wa&gt;'ne drivers. 

My mother has a dail) quota of 
three red lights that she must run every 
day. or else she's mad all night. The odd 
thing is that she's ne\'er gotten a ticket. 

I've seen people run red lights like 
they were nothing, without e\'en looking 
up from their magazines or from shav- 
ing or applying make-up, or whatever 
people in tJiis burg do while they are 
driving, other than the tedious task of 
actually paying attention to the road. 

I'm not leaving women out here, so 
just wait, but I don't think that I've ever 
seen a male Fon Wayne driver entirely 



by Matthew Perry, 
Staff Writer 



focused on the street 

1 saw a guy driving down Jefferson 
a couple of months ago with a beer in 
one hand and a porno mag in the other. 
1 don't even want to know what he was 
actually steering with. 

Women have always bad a bad rep 
about being bad drivers... and Fort 
Wayne is no exception. . 

The only thing that women drivers 
have going for them is that they, unlike 
men, actually pay attention to the 
road... only the road. 

It's as if they are horses with blind- 
ers on, because they cannot see road 
signs or traffic lights or anything other 
than the road in front of them, unless 
there is a semi-truck within a mile of 
them. 

When there is a semi-truck any- 
where in the somewhat-near vicinity, 
women get totally freaked out. They act 
as if the truck wants to play Blgfoot with 
their compact car. 

In conclusion, if we all tiy to pay a 
little more attention to our driving, it 
might be possible to have some decent 
Fort Wayne drivers.

Uinie Burrows helps kick off 
IPFIll's UJomen's History Month celebration 



by Mishanna Wood 
News Editor 



Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, 
Eleanor Roosevelt, Clara Barton: What 
do they have in common? They are 
people who have made significant 
contributions in American hiitorj . 

These women, along with 33 oth- 
ers, are on the commemorative poster 
"Women putting our Stamp on 
America," which will be displayed out- 
side the Arts and Sciences offices 
ever&gt;' spring during March. 

"I wish 

op!e could name 

â– e American 

I women outside of 

I Hillary Clinton and 

I Tipper Gore," Linda 

I Fox, director of 

f Women's Studies and 

associate professor 

I of Spanish, said. 

Women's 
History Month began 
as a congressional 
proclamation in 

1981. 

The National 
Women's Hisior&gt;' project was interest- 
ed in the program because women's 
accomplishments needed to be recog- 
nized. Fox said. 

Vinie Burrows, an acclaimed 
"actor" as she calls herself, will per- 
form her one- woman show 
"Daughters of the Sun" on Sunday, 
Feb. 28, at 7 p.m. in the Neff Recital 
Hall. Her 70-minute act will begin 
IPFW's celebrabon of Women's Histor&gt;' 
Month. 

Burrows has given over 5,000 
performances throughout the world 
and has been designated as living leg- 
end by the National Black Theatre 
Festival. 




Vinie 
Burrows 



She was born in Harlem and graduat- 
ed with a pre-law degree from New 
York University. 

Burrows thought that roles for 
serious African-American actors were 
too infrequent and her first play, 
"Walk Together Children," debuted 
on Nov. 11, 1%8. 

Since then she has created seven 
other one-woman shows.has became a 
p'erman'ent representative of the 
United Nations for the Women's 
International Democratic federation 
and has won several awards. 

This performance is an integrated 
approach to Black Histoo' Month and 
Women's History- Month, Fox said. 

Burrows will conduct a workshop 
for theatre and music students and 
meet the The Black Collegian Caucus, 
which is one of the many cosponsors 
of this event. 

Women's Studies will hold its 
fourth annual "Celebrating Our 
Students" Research and Creativity 
Day, Wednesday, March 17 from 11 
a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in Walb 224. 

Students will reveal their projects 
on women's issues and have the 
opportunit&gt;' to present their ideas ai 
the "Celebrating Our Students" con- 
ference at lU Kokomo on March 26. 

On March 27, Diane Rogers 
African Dance Troupe will perform in 
Walb Ballroom at 2 p.m. introducing 
LayJi Miller Bashir, attorney at law. 

She will present "Do they hear 
you when you cry?: Female Genital 
Mutilation and the case of Fauziya 
Kassindja vs. the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service." 

Kassindja had refused to return 
to Togo, a country where she would 
have suffered female genital mutila- 
tion. 

Due to her refusal to return, the 
Integration and Naturalization Service 
sent her to prison. 

While Bashir made it possible for 



the release of Kassindja on April 24, 
1996, she also aided in the victory for 
women and refugees to have the first 
asylum granted in the country on 
June 13. 1996, for the reason of gen- 
der oppression.

"Can you 
name significant 
numbers of 
women who 
made contribu-

American soci-

have a better

If you are a baccalaureate 
or graduate student who 
strives to reach the maximum 
development of your intellec- 
tual skill, &gt;ou will soon have 
the opportunity to join the 
IPFW chapter of Phi Kappa 
Phi, an organization dedicated 
to the recognition and promo- 
tion of superior scholarship in 
all disciplines of higher educa- 
tion. 

Every spring this presti- 
gious organization invites the 
top 10 percent of students 
who have acquired senior 
standing along with outstand- 
ing graduate students, facult&gt;', 
and alumni to be inducted 
into this international honon 
societ&gt;'. 

IPFW's chapter of Phi 
Kappa Phi inducted 31 stu- 
dent members last year and 
has 34 active faculty mem- 
bers. 

The selection process Is 
currently underway to nomi- 
nate this year's inductees for 
the IPFW chapter. 

Qualified students should 
receive invitations at the 
beginning of March and an 
induction ceremony will be 
held on April U in Walb 
Union Rooms 224-228. 



Kimberly McDonald, 
president of IPFWs Phi Kappa 
Phi chapter, said a major ben- 
efit of joining the organization 
is the tangible recognition 
that students have demon- 
strated excellence in scholarly 
endeavors. 

While value is placed on 
academics in the form of 
acknowledgment for scholas- 
tic excellence, the organiza- 
tion also grants more than 
5380,000 in scholarships and

The honor society at 
IPFW submits one nominee for 
the Phi Kappa Phi Graduate 
Fellowship each year.

a lifetime membership award 
to the Phi Kappa Phi organiza- 
tion and will be one of around 
two hundred students com- 
peting for this award. 

The 1999 review process 
for the nominee is currently 
underway and the nominee 
will be named by early March. 

"Those students who 
want to go on to graduate 
school should definitely join," 
said Mary Arnold Schwartz, 
student representative to the 
IPFW Phi Kappa Phi honor 
society. "You really feel a 
part of a scholarly communi- 
t&gt;'-" 

In addition to eligibility 



for fellowships and scholar- 
ships, members of the honors 
organization are able to pre- 
sent and read about scholastic 
studies in the National Forum, 
a quarterly journal published 
by the Phi Kappa Phi organi- 
zation. 

"Students and faculty 
have a great opportunit) to 
affiliate and network with 
other individuals who value 
academic achievement," said 
Sarah Beckman, public rela- 
tions officer of the Phi Kappa 
Phi organization at IPFW. 

Phi Kappa Phi has more 
than 80,000 members in 281 
chapters. Established in 1897 
by a student at The Universit&gt; 
of Maine who wanted to 
"make heroes of scholars," it

dent-elect, Lucille Hess; secre- 
tary Arthur Friedel; treasurer,

Speech, continued from Page 1 



Mayor Helmke's second goal regards 
plans for expanding the Grand Wayne Center. 
According to the ma&gt;or, our convenfion cen- 
ter has fallen behind other centers in cities 
like Indianapolis, Evansville, and South Bend. 
This has generated losses in tourism. 

Helmke plans on raising S5 million of the 
S25 million project through using revenues 
from the Cit&gt; Light Lease. This will get the pro- 
ject on the "drawing board," he said. 

Mayor Helmke's third, and final, goal will 
be to improve housing. He wants to work with 
the Central Cit&gt; Housing Trust Fund Board to 
do more than provide resources for housing 
repairs. 

The Board will establish the Southeast 
Home ownership to provide opportunities for 
low-income families to receive mone&gt;' for a 
house down pa&gt;Tnent. 

The Rental Housing Task Force is going to 
be eslabhshed this week via an executive order 
of the mayor. The Task Force is supposed to 
design a rental housing ordinance. This hope- 



fully will take care of both problem landlords 
and problem tenants. 

Mayor Helmke addressed the mayoral 
candidates in attendance in his closing 
remark. "1 challenge the next mayor â€” and 1 
hope \oiers do the same â€” to he courageous in 
implementing plans to move Fort Wa&gt; ne 
forward into the next centur&gt;'." 

The mayor concluded his speech with the 
following statements: 

"What will you do in 1999 to make our 
city a better place in which to live? How will 
you contribute? Don't sit on the sidelines and 
complain. Vote. Volunteer, Voice your opinion. 
Together, we'll make a difference." 

" I look for^^â– a^d to taking Fort Wa&gt;'ne into 
the year 2000. Thank you for allowing me the 
privilege to serve as Mayor of this great cit&gt;' 
for the past 1 1 years."

Fiction 



by Adam Taylor 
Features Edrlor 



Looking around his house, 
Ted couldn't believe whal 
stood before his eyes-- 
absolutely nothing. 

What the movers couldn't 
pack a couple of days ago had 
left a wetk ago with his wife. 

Just weeks before, the 
house seemed full of life and 
memories. Now the house was 
as empty as his sense of 
belonging there. 

His job there had been 
completed hours ago. 

Ted told his wife that he'd 
remain in town after her 
departure to wrap up the last- 
minute tasks that came with 
leaving one state for 
another. 

He closed their checking 
accounts, supervised the 
move, and just finished clean- 
ing the house for Its new occu- 
pants--people that would 
arrive in the next week to 
begin their own legacy with 
the building. 

All that remained was 
finding the strength to leave 
the place that for 24 years he 
called home and, in all of his 
50 years of existence, he could 
scarcely remember a job so 
difOcult. 

Granted, this wasn't the 
first time Ted was made to 
leave something he loved. 
After all. he had to leave home 
when he graduated high 
school, leaving his parents 
behind with his departure. 

As difficult as that was, 
though, it was a little different 
from what he was undertaking 
now. 

That was the place he was 
born and raised in, so it was 
somewhat difficult, but he left 
with the knowledge that he 
could always come back. In 
this case, there was no coming 
back. 

Besides, the entire fact 
that he was born into his 
childhood home made it that 
much easier to leave it. 

Despite having countless 
memories associated with that 
house, it was a household that 
his father had built and main- 
tained. 

Things seemed a little dif- 
ferent lea\ing there, as he felt 
that leaving that house was 
not so much an end to any- 
thing, but a beginning to his 
new lifeâ€” a life filled with the 
responsibilit&gt;' of beginning his 
own family and starting his 
own household. 

During college, he main- 
tained residency on campus 
until he finally graduated. 
From the time between gradu- 
ating college and the time he 
met his wife and finished 
graduate school, he lived in 
various apartment 
buildings. 

It wasn't until he and his 
wife decided to make their 
relationship life-long that he 
decided a house would be a 
sound investment. 

After his marriage was set 
and the wedding was over, he 
and his wife began to search 



J^ Life Worth Living 




for a house that would meet 
their needs. 

Since they had already 
agreed on how large their fam- 
ily would grow, they limited 
their search to homes In good 
neighborhoods with enough 
rooms for them and the two 
children they planned to have 
in the future. 

Finally agreeing upon 
one, they settled down in a 
house outside of town with a 
pond and plenty of space for 
the children to play. 

As soon as they were 
moved in, a baby was on the 
way. At least that's the way it 
seemed to Ted. A few years 
separated the two events, but 
It was as though his life In the 
house didn't really begin until 
the birth of his son. 

That experience, no 
doubt, could be considered 
one of the greatest experiences 
of his life. 

During his wife's entire 
pregnancy, he remained close 
at her side. He would wait on 
her hand and foot when he 
was around her, call three or 
four times a day when he was 
at work to check up on her 
and tell his boss flat-out that 
there was no way he was leav- 
ing her for a business trip as 
his family took priority over 
his job. 

In fact, he was in the mid- 
dle of a meeting when his wife 
went into labor. He never saw 
the end of this meeting, since 
he was out the door the sec- 
ond he got the news to 
meet her at the hospital. 

His passion for his family 
was understood b&gt; his col- 
leagues, though, and the inci- 
dent went without reprimand 
from his superiors. 

If his devotion wasn't 
clear the first time his wife was 
pregnant, it became clear 
when Ted went through the 
same routine while his wife 
was pregnant with his daugh- 
ter. L _ _ 

Even after their births, his 
devotion to his family still 
remained. He and his wife 
would alternate ukjng care of 
crying babies, Ted often times 
arguing over whether It was 
his turn to take care of the 
kids, even if it wasn't. 

He wanted the best for his 
wife as well as his children. 
and that was clear through 
every action that he took. 

It was clear in the dance 
recitals he drove his daughter 
to, in the baseball games he 
coached for his son, and in the 
dinners he made for his worn- 
out wife. 

Ted had, he believed, 
found the "American Dream." 
It was something his father 
spoke to him about while on 
his deathbed and something 
he had often thought about, 
but never really thought he 
would understand. His life was 
given a sense of dignit&gt;, dut&gt; 
and meaning. 

The years would pass and 
find Ted's children resembling 
their parents in form, if not in 
maturity. They became 
teenagers before either Ted or 
his wife had realized It, and 



the fact became more and 

more evident that preit&gt;' soon 
the children would be adults. 

It was never more so evi- 
dent to Ted until the day his 
son graduated, followed short- 
ly thereafter hy Ted's daugh- 
ter. As he partook in his chil- 
dren's special moments, he 
was reminded of decades 
before when he himself was a 
graduate from high school. 

It was an exciting time for 
htm, knowing that soon his life 
would be his own. He remem- 
bered what it felt like leaving 
home and how excited he was 
at the adventure of defining 
his own destin&gt;. 

He had some foundations 
set in the form of his mother 
and father and had some 
experience acquired in the 
game of life, but there was 
always that open territor&gt;' that 
he had never &gt;et explored that 
fascinated him and pulled him 
fonvard with the passing of 
each day. 

He couldn't help but envy 
his children on their gradua- 
tion da&gt;s and looked forward 
to seeing their lives take on 
the form of his own. 

Now that they had, he felt 
as though it was time to quit 
dwelling on the past and move 
on. He and his wife were bet- 
ter off in a smaller house now. 

As Ted walked from room 
to room, he could still recall 
the scenes that occurred in 
each room as if they were hap- 
pening before his eyes. 

He saw the door he car- 
ried his children through days 
after their birth: the same 
door he walked through ever&gt;- 
daj to go to work and come 
home, the same door his chil- 
dren came and went through 
on their ways to and from 
school and the same door his 
wife entered and left through 
during her numerous journeys 
to town. 

He saw the spot where he 
play.ed. cards. wjth_lii5 Triends. - 
prior to_the_birth of his chil- 
dren, the same area which 
would find a new use as his 
children became old enough 
to have homework 

He saw the place they put 
the Christmas tree ever&gt;' &gt;ear. 

He saw the place they 
gathered to watch the televi- 
sion every night for 24 years. 

He saw the place he slept 
in for 24 years. 

He saw the place where 
his kids said their last goodbye 
before going off to college and 
the place his wife said good- 
bye before departing for their 
new home. 

With each memory, 
though, Ted was given a rea- 
son to let go of the pile of 
memories set forth by that 
house. 

He was reminded, as he 
pictured his children, that 
soon they would likely have 
children of their own and that 
they would be too bus&gt; to bo a 
part of his memories, as they 
would be making some of their 
own. 

Fighting back the tears, 
Ted said his final goodbyes to 
the interior of the houseâ€” the 



house that played such a large 
role in who he was today-and 
set out to give the exterior one 
final look. 

Walking out towards the 
pond in the back, Ted was 
reminded of the many sum- 
mer dajs he spent with his 
family and friends passing the 
lime away. 

He recalled football 
games, horseshoe matches, 
fishing expeditions to the 
pond, barbecues, and even 
camping. 

These warm, sunny days 
made It hard for him to keep 
walking but he eventuall&gt; 
made it out to the pondâ€”the 
same pond at which he 
recalled advising his son. 

Staring at the water, he 
never remembered it looking 
so serene. In fact, he never 
remembered it at all, as he was 
rarely alone when he was visit- 
ing the pond and was usually 
distracted by the company he 
was \vith. 

As he reflected on the 
changes the wind made on the 
water, he also reflected on the 
changes that pervaded his life 
and his mind became mired in 
the difficult)' of letting go. 

To leave this house today 
would mean to say goodbye to 
events that had become the 
backbone of his 
very existence. 

On the other hand, with- 
out the constant reminder of 
those events he would be free 
to pursue new interests, gain- 
ing new experiences to join 
with the material wealth he 
had already accumulated in 
the shape of his family. 

He was 50 years old, but 
50 could still be considered 
pretty young compared to 
100. 

After all, his father always 
told him you're only as young 
as you act, and you're only as 
old as you let &gt;'0urself feel. 
â–  - -.Withv^a^; deep sigh,, 



Ted picked up a rock and 
fiung it across the pond. 

As he walked towards the 
driveway, he carefully made a 
mental note of ever&gt; image he 
perceived until finally reach- 
ing his car. 

Climbing in, Ted started 
the engine and slosvly backed 
out, careful not to damage the 
dignity of the moment. 

Ted was off to join his 
wife, ready to begin the ardu- 
ous task of getting their new 
house in order. 

Leaving that house 
behind began to feel more and 
more like leaving his parents' 
house behind, Ted thought, as 
he began his long journey 
home to his wife.

Student government 
announces position changes 



by CarrieAnne Leathers 
Diiel Reporter 

Both the student body 
xice president and pro-tem- 
pore of the student senate 
have been reelected due to the 
resignation of former student 
body president Chuck Norris. 

Joe Schroeder was 
moved up from vice president 
to president in order to fill 
Norris' position and Jim 
Corson was elected to fill the 
vice president position. 
Nicholas Grey was elected to 
fill the position of senate pro- 
tempore. 

"He had quite a few 
duties and he needed to 
devote more time to his stud- 
ies," Corson said. 

Corson was elected by 



the student senate and has 
been involved in university 
activities and groups for six 
semesters. 

"I've been a part of the 
student government for a cou- 
ple of years along with other 
student activities," Corson 
said. 

Besides working with 
the ocher members of the stu- 
dent body government on 
budget and financial propos- 
als, Corson is hoping to work 
with students on iheir ideas. 

"I'm always open to 
new ideas from students 
whether it be about organiza- 
tions of students here on cam- 
pus or any ideas that they 
have," Corson said. 

Other than new ideas, 
Corson is considering the pos- 
sibility of opening a 24 hour 



computer lab in Kettler. He 
also would like to see more 
rec&gt;cling on campus. 

"1 like representing the 
students and I'd like to see a 
little more student involve- 
ment and voice on campus." 
Corson said. 

Corson was elected 
with a two-thirds vote in the 
senate. Schroeder is confident 
that Corson is a good choice 
for leader of the senate. 
"Jim is ver&gt;' experienced in 
student government and will 
do an excellent job as leader 
of the senate," said Schroeder. 

Corson welcomes calls 
and comments from the stu- 
dent bodj' and he can be 
reached In his office at 481- 
6589.

Fighting Irish fights Big Ten 



Notre Dame 
rejects offer to be 
12 th team in 
prestigious 
conference 

by Brian Mill&amp;r, 
Sports Editor 

'Unless you're white, a 
sports fan, and a friend of 
mine; please don't read 
this story. 

Just kidding, but it made 
you mad, didn't it? 

This is the same kind of 
idiotic thinking that was made 
with the "oh so prestigious, 
too good for anybody else" 
Notre Dame Fighting Irish. 

The unheralded decision 
not to join the Big Ten 
Conference last Saturday was 



a decision only a "snobby 
school" such as Notre Dame 
would make. 

Growing up, I used to be 
an Irish fan, but within this 
last year seeing the two letters 
"ND" has made me want to 
vomit 

It's the immaturity of 
some of their students, terri- 
ble decisions on the sports 
field and now the rejection of 
the Big Ten that have really 
turned me against this 
institution. 

I believe the tradition 
they say they want to uphold 
has already been abolished by 
them joining the Big East. 

You see, with Domers and 
the "prestigious" Notre Dame 
University, you get 
inconsistency. 

One day they want to be 
your friend, the next day 
they're your worst enemy. 

They're fence-sitters who 
can't make up their minds

ball? Well, 
unfortunately, that is 
only for about 
10 students. 

I am a strong 
believer in the 
adage that "everyone 
is created equal," but, 
unfortunately, 
Domers don't have 
the same philosophy. 
Personally, I 
think Notre 

Dame was just 
intimidated by teams 
such as Michigan, 
Ohio State, Purdue 
and Penn State. 

Sure, they put 
two or three of these 
teams on their sched- 
ule, but I have to 
believe if Notre Dame 
ever wants to win its 
dominance back in 
football, they have to 



join a conference. 

I was outraged by their 
decision, but as I think about 
it, I am pleased they did not 
join. 

They didn't hurt the con- 
ference. 

All they hurt was their 
pride, and I think any Big Ten 
fan will welcome either 
Missouri, Rutgers, or any 
other Midwest team just the 
same. 

Memo to Notre Dame: 
you're not Yale. Stop trying to 
act like an Ivy League school. 

Your football team might 
beat Yale; however, that does 
not classify you as an Ivy 
League school. 

You're not the envy of 
the collegiate world, and trust 
me, this decision did not help. 

You guys have your fun 
at South Bend, because in the 
state of Indiana, that's the 
only place that considers you 
god. 

lU can beat you in bas- 
ketball, Purdue can beat you 
in football, and IPFW can 
cream you in volleyball.

Sports Editor 

The Men's Volleyball team 
is off to a great start, standing 
at 6-0. 

Led by premier hitters 
such as Chris Gisslen and 
Hector Soto, the Dons will face 
the Number One team in ihe 
nation at the Gates Sports 
Center this Saturday at 7:30 
p.m. 

Lewis Universit&gt;- is peren- 
nially a very competitive vol- 
leyball team, and this year 
proves to be no different, 

lewis is a taller team and 
may have some defensive 
strengths; however, the Dons 
may be deeper and have more 
offensive weapons. 

Soto, who is one of the 
best hitters in the nation, is 
looking to make another run at 
PIa3'er of the Year. 

A win against Lewis will 
make it that much better. The 
team, so far, has knocked off 
teams such as Ohio State and 
Penn State, all of which are 
high caliber teams, but none of 
which will be as tough as Lewis. 

The surprising play of Jeff 
Ptak and Scott Lane really has 
the Dons peaking at the right 
time. 

With a three-game sweep 
over Penn State, the Dons have 
confidence and momentum on 



their side, which will help 
when Lewis comes to town. 

When IPFW played sixth- 
ranked Ohio State, the Gates 
Sports Center was rocking, 
bringing in roughly 2.000 fans. 
With ESPN's Jock Rock blaring 
through (he P. A. system, the 
Dons seemed invincible. 

With the same atmosphere 
and a 6-0 record on the line. 
the Dons should be focused. 

Lewis, however, will not 
underestimate Coach Amie Ball 
and the Dons, so expect them 
to be ready. 

Keys of the game will dcfi- 
nitel&gt; be who starts off hot. If 
the Dons get the first game 
under their belt, they should 
be in the driver's seat. 

However, if Lewis starts off 
hot, watch out. 

The Dons orchestrated an 
amazing comeback against 
Ohio State but Le\vis could be a 
litde stronger. 

The play of Ptak will be 
crucial. He is one of the best 
young guys in the game, and if 
he can draw some attention it 
should help out Soto. 

Gisslen also has to be per- 
fect in the play calling. The 
entire offense goes through 
him and if he is on top of his 
game the Dons should roll to 
7-0.
