Last Wednesday Ralph Nadci 
the noted comsumcr advocate, ap- 
peared in Fort Wayne. During a 
press conference prior to his ad- 
dress, Nnder strictly listed hie 
priorities as pollution, the auto 
industry, and the food industry. 

The food industry, he said, 
is by far the largest in dollar 
fraud, The_autn industry ranks as 
a big offender even though i 



1. less pollution 

2. more emphasis on the product 

3. more consumer protection despite Nixon

ever, one way to reduce defects 
would be to make public reports 
on how defects come about. This 
would be a terrific incentive for 
not repeating defects. 

Our economic system has 
slid to th.; point where 3 or 4 com- 
panies control a mnrltct. With this, 
"the product ceases to be signi- 
ficant."

CHARLES REDD 
Tells It Like It Is. 



Charles Redd, head of the Ft. 
Wayne Urbon League, spoke on 
compus lost Tuesday. Redd, ap- 
pearing as guost lecturer in Dr. 
Coufoudakis' Public Bureaucracy 
class lectured on bureaucratic re- 
sponsiveness to the problems 
facing todoy's society. 

While refering to the "est-

that the bureaucratic establishment 
exists only for the benefit of those 
who possess the power. In effect 
this means the rich and the white. 
Various minority groups who pos- 
sess no power, exist only for the 
continued enrichment of the power- 
structure. 

Explaining bow this power- 
structure comes about, Redd pre- 
sented the Alien-Anxiely-Self- 
Interest Theory. Bureaucracy 

creates on anxiety in the institu- 
tion which then produces on alien- 
ating force against the weak. This 
force serves the self-interest and 
aids perpetuation of the power- 
structure. 

The reaction of mony people 
today against the institution is ihen 
likely to creote a conflict within 
the structure. Redd feels that if 
the bureaucratic structure does not 
become more responsive to the 
people—those presently kept with- 
out power are likely to say

MUGGLE FRUMP IMARTY M - 

Because I've read oil my comic books, chewed all my bubble gum, and 
lost my coloring book, [ decided to try writing a column for ilti Communi-- 
color. In an attempt toward making it worthwhile reading, I sought a partner 
who could collaborate in producing a lively column full of wit and useful 
information. Well, all I found was Marly so we ended up with this instead. 
Being of unsound mind and body, we decided to immediately set out and 
reform this newspaper. We figured it would be a sure-fire way of making 
a hit with the Starr. The first installment is this anonymous letter written 
by Marty M. and delivered by a World War II pigeoo with a noticeable limp, 
who arrived in the middle or the night humming an obscene lullaby to him- 
seK. We arc reprinting it in the hope that someone will take pity and read 
it to as. I want you to know it is a distinct disadvantage being illiterate

A man came to ask the rabbi of Lubin to help him against aliem 
thoughts which intruded on him while he prayed. The rabbi indicated 
what he was to do, but the man went on asking questions and would not 
stop. Finally the rabbi said: "I don't know why you keep complaining to 
me of alien thoughts. To him who has holy thoughts, an impure thought 
comes at times, and such a thought is called 'alien*. But you--you have 
just your own usual thoughts. To whom do you want to ascribe them?"

Poor Earthworm 

Onco upon o time there was a clever, intelligent, industrious earth, 
worm. This clever, intelligent, industrious earthworm wantedvery much to 
attend Worm University where he hoped to learn everything possible about 
tunneling. His reason for wonting to learn this was that he hoped lo earn 
his living by teaching tunneling to others and he also hoped lo help worm- 
kind. 

Our clever, intelligent, industrious little earthworm did learn quite o- 
lot about tunneling. He not only learned to tunnel, but also learned to make 
rooms, terraces, built-in furniture, ond storehouses. 

Worm University did not ollow its students to study only one subject. 
Our clever, intelligent, industrious worm also had to study decomposition 
and materials. This was good since it was nice to know if one wos tun- 
neling through grovel or limestone, fresh garbage or old garbage. However, 
the worm had to also learn to sing a song and dance to a cerloin tune. 
Poor eorlhworm! He had a tin ear and was a hopeless dancer. Woe, Woe!! 
He could not graduate because of these deficiencies.

HERE'S WHAT 

Starting Monday, April 5, 1971, a portion of the driveway at the front 
of the Education Bailding will be closed. The street ares closed will 
extend from the flog pole, weal to the comer. This closure is necessitated 
because of the huilding modification required to convert to a new heating- 
cooling system for the total campus. This roadway will remain closed for 
approximately 90 days. 

During the period of closure, city bus service (loading and unloading) 
will be accomplished on the west drive at the corner nearest the south- 
west comer of the cafeteria-library wing of the Education Building. Per- 
sons using city bus service are encouraged to use the south entrance of 
the cafeteria-library wing to gain easy access to city bus service or the 
building. After loading or unloading, the bus will do a Y-lum around at 
the Power Plant and hack track the west drive in exiting our campus. Oa 
the way out, the bus will pick up any late arrivals at the bus stop area. 

In order to alleviate traffic congestion with the front street area 
closed, ail passenger loading and unloading pf private outos will he en- 
couraged to take place at the east end of the east wing of the Education 
Building adjacent to the west area of the "A" parking area. 

All parking meters in the area west of the flag pole will be unavail- 
able for use during the construction period. The parking meters to the 
south of the flag pole will be available for UBe during the construction 
period; however, access to aod depurture from this area will have to be 
from the south driveway. 

During the week of April 5-9, 1971, all "B" parking lota will be 
closed for re-grading. The "A" parking areas will be available to all for 
parking during this interim period. 

In addition, ond day next week (April 5-9) the east entrance (aear the 
County Extension Building) will be closed to replace a damaged culvert. 
The specific day is undecided until we receive a final date from the con- 




HERE'S WHY 



Work has already be fc __. _ 
indertaking that will convert the 
present heating system of the uni- 
versity from gas and oil to dec 
tricity, making the heating of the. 
huildings more economical and ef- 
fective. The main reason for con- 
verting the heating system is 
thai the present system will not 
be able to handle the demands of 
all the future buildings, some of 
which were not in the original 
plans far the campus. 

Causing the shutdown of the 
drive is the necessity to dig a 
vault deep enough to install the 
new heating system just to the 
west of the main entrance of the 
building. Two 22 Teet electric 
boilers will then be installed, 
though only one will ever by used 



at one time, with the other acting 
as a standby. There will be no 
disruption of heat during the in- 
stallation, and, other than the 
noise caused by the digging, the 
closed-off drive is the only incon- 
venience to the students and fac-

JOIN THE MARINES 



Last Friday a Marine recruiter 
tried his luck on the Regional 
Cnmpus. This reporter doesn't 
know how many souls he signed, 
but he did draw a small crowd of 

About fifteen students showed 
up to picket the Marines in particu- 
lar and militarism in general, 
They congregated around the 
recruiter's truck, which just 
happened to be parked in front 
of expired meter, (when this sit- 
untion was explained to the campus 
police, they acknowledged the 
fact, but did not ticket the truck). 

Meanwhile, the protesters 
displayed signs, satirically 
noting the virtues of dying and 
killing and chanted at the recruiter. 
A perfect backdrop would have 
been Country Joe's I-Feel-Like- 
I'm-Fixin'-to-Die-Rag. 

The demonstration wasn't 
big in .numbers. It did, however, 
show that a discontent with 
American war policy is still 
around— no matter what Nixon 
says about campus unrest de- 
creasing. 

According to Mike Wallace, 
CBS News, 68 civilians per day 
arc killed in Southeast Asia. 
Accroding to the Defense Depart- 
ment's own figures 300,000 have

LP's intramural basketball program 

by Uarrcll Parnin L ° 



Referees define 
in terms of girl's intramural 
basketball, and contend they 
feel like Bill Buckley debat- 
ing several Margaret Mitchells 
simultaneously. But if you are 
awed by the graceful flight 
and landings of birds— mostly 
crash landings, and find exc it- 
men t in the melee fighting 
action of Roller Derby, than 
it's the game to be watching. 

One bald ref at the game 
was so worried that his scalp 
began turning gray. He was 
sa bald that one could mis- 
take his head for a bowling 
ball, which probably could be 
used for one by sticking your 
finger in his ear. 

The game did not have 
the fines of polished shooting, 
high scoring offenses, and 
rugged defenses—but neither 
did the ployers display any 



]ck of enthusi 



y. 



One first thinks that this 
sport was organized for girls 
to apeze the general concensus 
that they were not receiving a 
justifiable share of the Athle- 
tic Budget to which they con- 
tribute over 50 per cent of the 
Funds. Others muse it only 
proves that our Athletic Pro- 

The latter answer— like 
astrology is olat of Taurus. 
True, it was at the initial 
girl's gome that a ref uttered 



the deathless quote on seei 
that he had to referee a gir 
game- "Help!" 

It wos at this same gai 
that Carol Baker, otherwi 
known as the Dick Butkus 
inlromural football, sa

he met Joyce "Meadowlark" 
Seigers, Mel "The Rocket" 
Refrae, Nancy "Hovilchek" 
Messerschmidt and many 



other 

'Seeing that the refs were 
obviously amused by the sit- 
uation, I inquired: "Which do 
you think is funnier: The Flip 
Wilson Show or girl's intra- 
mural basketball?" Quickly 
the ref painted out: "I don't 
think Flip Wilson's that funny." 

It was here that yours 
truly laughed, and laughed, — 
and laughed when the refs 
came in and said, "We 
thought Americans hod re- 
spect for basketball. Now 
look what they have done. 
Where's the National Basket- 
ball Writer's Association when 
we need them? What is the 

matter with the ABA, the 

NBA, the NCAA?" 

Shucks refs. Indiana's 
famous as a hotbed of basket- 
ball, where innovations are 
born. We are just continuing 
the tradition. 

The refs retorted: "Next 
thing you know, women will 
demand the right to vote." 
And they laughed some more. 

But it is not all the 
laughs the audience gets and 
the enjoyment the girls get 
that makes expanding all 
facets of girl's intramurals 
worth doing. Girls do fund

FOSTER PARK 



an eye-witness report 

by Steve Franks 

Certainly everyone has heard 

about last Sunday's demonstration 

riot, confrontation (pick one) in 

Foster Park. The trouble is that 

most people beard about it through 

the locol news media, which just 

happened to look at the event 

through blue-tinted glasses. 

The trouble started much ear- 
lier than was reported. Early in the 

day some people were flying kites 

in the park. They ventured across 

the road on to the golf course. This 

brought the pork police who told 

the youths to get back and, for 
good measure, that only six-year- 
olds would fly kites. 

That began a migration to the 
golf course. Remember that the 
people were not obstructing play, 
as they stayed in the edge of the 
rough. Reinforcements in blue came 
to move the kids back-reinforce- 
ments in hair had also come. 

Action moved back and forth 
the road many times. As soon as 
police would clear the kids off the 
golf course, some more would 
sneak back to "liberate the hill." 
During one such liberation, some- 
one took the flag from green ten 
and brought it over to the demon- 



not heforc someone pulled the air 
valve oat of the cop car's tires - 
not slashed the tires. 

Everyone stayed cool for a 
while, with the chanting ("Old 
McDonald had a farm, and on that 
farm be had n pig.") and liberating 
going on. When the wrecker ar- 
rived to bail out the police car, 
someone pulled the air valve on 
one of its tires also. I repeat that 

The police went into hysterics 
at this measure. They ran to their 
cars and armed themselves with 
helmets, clubs and tear gas, in ad- 
dition to their nuns. The crowd 
moved back toward the river. As far 
as bottles being thrown, I saw two. 
One almost bit me and neither 
landed near a cop. 

At this time one boy was ap- 
proached by a policeman. The boy 
was carrying a branch. The police- 
man told him that if the boy threw 
the branch he would kill him. 
Think about that. 

gas.

&lt;sle. 



with 



Shortly thereafter, a youth was 
busted. (I thought it was for taking 
the flag--l saw no fighting.) Every- 
surfounded the police car where he 
was being questioned. Someone 
haphazardly tossed a few small 
rocks, but wbb stopped by the other 
-kids. They wanted no violence. 

The youth was released, but 



Another victory for the dc,.,„„&lt;r 
tors, as the gas blew hack into the 
policemen's faces. This act did 
manage to disperse the crowd. [ t 
also maoaged to disperse all the 
golfers. It also managed to gas a 
little boy, not over ten years old, 
who was vomiting, couldn't breathe 
and had to have oxygen. He'll grow 
up with nice memories. 

If I would try to place the 
blame for this incident, riot, con- 
frontation, (pick one) I would say 
both sides were at fault. Both the 
youths and the police overreacted.
