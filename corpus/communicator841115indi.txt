Last Wednesday normal routines in 
the Classroom and Medical Building 
came lo a hall as the lire alarm 
sounded. Following emergency 
procedures, staff, faculty and students 
began lo evacuate Ihebuilding. 

However, slop for a moment and 
think about being in a building with 
more than one level and being unable 
louse the stairs or the elevator to exit

Personal counseling at IPFW is 
more than just finding answers lo the 
questions of how to deal with stress 
and how lo cope with anxiety. 

Several resources for personal 
counseling are available at IPFW 
Vivian Hernandez, a psychologist from 
Park Center, Is available on a part- 
time basis for all students. Working 
with short term, goal -orientated 
therapy. Hernandez is presently 



"Very often, a student on a campus 
such as IFPW feels overwhelmed by 
riorum;, i iii lilies — Job. family, school 
work — and may find themselves In a 
crisis situation, where things seem lo 
be falling apart," said McCray- 
Worrall. who is an ordained 
Presbyterian clergywoman with a 
doctorate in pastoral counseling. 

Counseling all faiths and all in- 
dividuals, from Ihe non- traditional

"The problen

depression." she said 

One technique Hernandez uses is 
progressive relaxation which leaches 
people to relax and, therefore, lo deal 
with the pressures of stress more ef- 
fectively. 

In conjunction wilh Campus 
Ministry, o women's group dealing 
with self concept and assertiveness, 
was offered by Hernandez and Rev. 
Marga ret McCray- Worral. 

The g.-oup, which will meet again in 
the spring, "provides an opportunity 
for women to get together with other 
women students in a small Intimate 
atmosphere lo discuss the problems 
with being a student and 






■jaidw 






The group also locuses on developing 
skills necessary in interacting with 
other people. 

In the future, Hernandez hopes to 
offer a workshop centering around 
ea ling disorders, such as anorexia and 
bulimia. 

An extension of personal counseling 
is pastoral counseling, which involves 
spintua I s trengtheni ng 



pe hence and learning." McCray- 
Worrall's goal Is lo help (he individual 
develop a 'sense of wholeness and 
strength. As a former La maze 
childbirth instructor, she also uses her 
skills in helping those dealing with 
crisis in pregnancy and childbirth 

McCray-Worrall spends most of her 
time at IPFW. although she also hasan. 
office at Indiana Institute of 
Technology and is available to SL 
Francis College. PVY Tech and 
International Business College 

Father Larry Kramer, pastor of Our 
Lady of Good Hope Parish also 
provides counseling as a referral lo 
Catholic students 

John Ulmer. dean of student ser- 
vices, as another resource at IPFW for 
personal counseling Ulmer. who has a 
doctorate in education with a maiorin 
counseling does "an awful lot of 
listening" while helping students cope 
and make adjustments with their lives 
The most common problems he deals 
wilh arc the stresses caused by Job, 
school and family — relationships 
from ihose between students and their 
parents to those between hizsbandiand 
wives — and some type of moderate 



personality disorders 

Ulmer is an advocate for Ihe student 
and. as a result, sees many students 
who "ore frustrated with Ihe 
bureaucracy of Ihe system" and tries 
lo resolve legili mate concerns 

Debbie Freimuth. disabled student 
services counselor, is available to all 
handicapped students who have 
personal problems or simply want lo

For all university employees and 
their families. IPFW also sponsors an 
Employee Assistance Program. This 
program is designed to deal wilh 
human problems - thekind that affect 
an employee's personal well-being and 
lusher ability to perform on the job. 
These problems may include marital

NOVEMBER is. t! 



Guisti may leave IPFW 



In this spate 1 several weeks ago, we 
wondered what WB1 going on concerning 
Ihe leavcuf absence taken by Chancellor 
Joseph P GiUMl 

We got the impression Giusti was 
looking for anoihet Job when Ihe booklet, 
"Giiali The First Five Years." was 
published He said ii was published as a 
publii- relations tool lor IPFW 

He responded to the editorial with a 
telephone call to The Communicator 
Office He talked about his job gathering 



inlor 



ing 



the 



reauthorization o( the Higher Education 
Ai I ol 1965 He said he wanted to be part 
of muking history 

(Jiusti also said his present and future 
were with IPFW 

Today, liiusti is in consideration (or 
the presidency at Easlcrn Kentucky 
University He is one of three finalists 
for Ihe job. If he is elected by the 
Eastern Kentucky Huard of Kegents, he 
will be expected lo start his new job in 
January 

(Jtusli hail lo have applied for the F.KU 
job sometime during Ihe summer, an 



Eastern Kentucky spokesman said If he 
was looking for a new job, why didn't 
Giusti tell anyone that when he began his 
leave of absence? 

If Giusti resigns as chancellor within 
Ihe next month lo begin a new job in 
January, he doesn't leave much time for 
Indiana and Purdue universities to find a 
replacement. 

If Giusti doesn't plan lo return, why 
then did he say his future is IPFW, when 
his future may be Eastern Kentucky. 

Giusti seems lo go out of his way to 
promote the IPFW image. If he is 
serious about IPFW's image, why not 
tell the trulh about his plans? 

The Giusti booklet appears, not to be a 
promotion of IPFW, but a promotion of 
Joseph P. Giusti — a glorified resume. 

The Fort Wayne Faculty Senate has 
denounced Ihe booklet as an em- 
barrassment to IPFW because it con- 



isstatements.
