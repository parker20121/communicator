IPFW sells itself to community 



ByJOIINMcGAULEY 
Chief Keporler 

For the first lime in ils history. IPFW 
islrymglosellilself — literally — via a 
comprehensive advertising campaign 
promoting evefylhing from night 
classes to Ihe university's mascot, the 
Mastodon. 

Mark Franke, director of enrollment 
managemenl. said thai in the past. 
IPFW has never used what he 
described as "image advertising," 
relying ordy on registration reminders 
lo intorm the public of university ac- 
livilies 111 accordance wilh an ongoing 
evalual loii ol IPFW by t he chancellor's 
iilfiLi-. Franke said that improving and 
building on the university's public 
image has become "one of our critical 



Franke said that IPFW draws more 
high school enrollees than Indiana and 
Purdue Universities combined. 

Conlinuing education for adults is 
sti-essed in an ad which details the ease 
of becoming accredited for classes 
taken in the past. Stressing IPFW's 



Intel 



vilh 



another ad claims Ihat while other 
schools prepare students for life in the 
real world. IPFW educates people from 
wilhin It The ad stales, "we iIPFWi 
don'l treat ihe real world like it's 
somewhere else." According to 
Franke, this particular approach plays 



on IPFW's unique identity as a com- 
muter college. 

One approach being taken which was 
not originally anlicipaled, but which 
proved surprisingly effective, is the 
theme of adaptability. Revolving 
around the university's Mastodon 
mascot, th'is series ol ads stresses the 
importance of a broad based core 
education, enabhng the student lo 
adapt in a rapidly changing world. 

Inspiration for the current campaign 
reportedly came last school year, but 
Franke said thai funds were nol made 



available for his department to carry 
out the project until this year. Between 
now and July 1^ the campaign is ex- 
pected to cost £50,000. 

While no organized effort lo gauge 
reaction lo the campaign has yet been 
made', Franke said thai his office has 
had some feedback on the project, 
which he described as "favorable," . 

Because of the limited ability to judge 
the campaign's effectiveness, whether 
or not it will be continued will not be 
decided until afler ils completion, 
which is expected around the lime of 
Fall regislration. 



According to Franke, the current 
advertising campaien is aimed in two 
primary directions, both emphasizing 
the idea that IPFW is a "real univer- 
sity ' and nol just a technical, or feeder 

By gelling lhii&gt; message into high 
school publications, Franke said thai 
the enrollment management office 
hopes lo correct the belief in high 
school students thai IPFW is ■just a 
school to iailjiatk on if they can't at- 
tend a larger university." The fact that 
siudents can attend IPFW white slill 
living al home and holding a job 
combine lo make IPFW a "smart 
choice " according lo some of Ihe ads 
already run 

PIT wins 
$10,000 
for efforts 

The efforts of PIT to present black 
theatre, increase black audience at- 
tendance, and develop black theatre 
arlists received a SlO.OOO award 
recently al Purdue University- West 
Lafayette. 

Purdue University President Steven 
C Becring made the presentation 
during ceremonies lo mark Affirmative 
Action Awareness Week "We don't 
alien Ihink of the theatre as a medium 
of education and Affirmative Action, 
but in this instance it is specially and 
especially true," Beering said. 

This is the second consecutive year 
ihal an affirmalive action program of 
IPFW's has won this competitive 
award, l-asl year the Sludenl Affairs 
Administration and its Affirmalive 
Action-Equal Opportunily Office won 
the award. All Purdue campuses may 
nominate programs for Ihe award, and 
in the 1987 competition, 13 applications 
were considered. Two winners were 
selected ihis year, and PIT shares the 
honor wilh the school of Pharmacal 
Sc-ience at the West Lafayette campus. 

David A, McCanls. chair of Ihe 
de|Kirtmenl of communication and 
theatre, and Larry L. Life, assistant 
professor of theatre, accepted the 

McCanls said Ihe award money will 
be usedio further black Ihcalrc through 
programs and performances al PIT. 
These plans may include bringing a 
black arlist-in-residence lo IPFW to 
conduct workshops and perfrom in a 
PIT production. 

"A guesl artist would be an in- 
valuable role model for ibe many 
talented black performers we're 
blessed wilh in Fort Wayne. Such a 
person can demonstrate, just by being 
here, thai there are opportunities out 
there in professional theatre for 
minority actors and technicians, 
provided they have the discipline and 
training, as well as the talent and 
desire, lo make it in this highly com- 
petllivc business," Life said. 

"Our progress loday is growing and 
measurable. 1 am hoping thai at some 
lime .soon we will no longer have need 
for a day like loday. because Af- 
firmative Action will have become so 
much an everyday part of our job," 
Beei'iiig said.

The professional manager 

Herendeen lives a manager's life 




'*A manager should be profes- 
sional in all areas from job to social. 
He or she should also be understand- 
ing of all people involved."

Managing Editor 

Editor's note: This article Is Ihe first 
In a scries which details a day In the life 
of facult), staff and sluJenls al IPFW. 

"An ideal student is one that actually 
forces the professor lo perform belter 
in the classroom by their knowledge of 
the text, and by their classroom par- 
licipation." Steven Herendeen, a 
professor in the supervision depart- 
ment, said. 



The supervision department is a 
department of Engineering. 
Technology and Nursing. 

Herendeen has been wilh the 
supervision department since 1981. He 
was a part-time professor for four 
years, and two years ago he Itecame 
full time. Supervision classes he 
teaches are: SPV 252-Human Relations 
in Supervision, 374-Managerial 
Supervision, 377PrDduclion Super- 
vision, 431-Uccupalional Safely and 
HcalUi. and :t99-Monetary Operations 
Analysis, a special lopic in supervision. 

Hercndt«n holds four degrees, and is 
working on his doctorate, Herendeen 
Itas a Bachelor of Science from Purdue, 
and two associate degrees from In- 
diana. Marketing Distribution and 
Operations Managemenl, Also from 
Indiana is a Master of Science in 
Education. 

What does Herendeen like best about 
teaching at IPFW? "f like the 
educational environment. It forces your 
mind lo create and instill new ideas." 

Herendeen's work experience is as 
impressive as his degrees. He has 20 
years industrial and Ira nsporla lion 
experience. He lias worked as a pur- 
chasing materials manager, an 



opera lions manager, dispatcher, 
foreman of foam refrigeration, and as a 
bartender. 

He has also spent lime in the United 
Status Army. While in the army he was 
an officer in the transports lion core, 
and was a Riot Control Commander 
during the riots of the lale 60's and 
early 70's. 

Herendeen said. "A manager should 
be professional in all areas from job lo 
social. He or she should also be un- 
derstanding of all people involved. Our 
current plant managers, and 
operations managers, need to know the 
back door as well as the front door to 
their operations." 

Nol only is Herendeen involved in 
leaching and furthering his education 
at the current lime, he also gives 
motivational speeches on positive 
mental attitude, and is a consultant to 
businesses on their production and 

Among Herendeen's various in- 
volvements are International 
Management Council Board Member, 
National Associalion of Industrial 
Technology, National Management 
Associalion, 19M-85 Who's Who Mid- 
west, and Institute of Certified 
Professional Managers.

BEST may not be the 
best plan for students 



In rese. Ihe United Slates lost 1711,00(1 
manufacturing jobs. From 1981 to 1983 
the United Slates agricultural exports 
felt by 29 percent. In 1983. Japan sold 11 
million cars worldwide, while Ihc United 
Stales lagged behind selling 8 million 
cars worldwide 

Japan leads the world in production of 
aulos. steel, ships, cameras, consumer 
electronics, machine lools, robols and 
public transportation 

What do these fads say to us, as 
citizens of America? Wlial do the facis 
say lo Ihe youth of America — those 
trying to plan their future"* 

The facts are saying thai in loday's 
world, where every country is fighting 
for economic success. America has 
never before had such a greal need for a 
highly educated work force, Ihe kind of 
work force which can provide a 
sophisticated technological base to give 
America economic success. 

This undoubtedly requires a 
nationwide commitment to post- 
secondary education — as well as 
suppori of elemenlary and secondary 
educalion. 

Recently, (he Indiana Genera! 
Assembly approved BEST, a college 
finance program whereby Ihc parents 
deposil money into an account lo finance 
the educalion of their children When the 
children are of college-age, Ihe parents 
can then withdraw Ihe money lo pay for 
the college tuition 

This money will be wailing in Ihe 
account when that child becomes 
college-age. This program is certainly 
laudable however, it only exists in a few 
slates. II is not a nationwide program. 
Furthermore, the federal government 



Heartland 



repeatedly says Ihey are devising such 
programs for Ihe middle class so Ihal 
those in lower-class income brackets can 
really derive Ihe benefits of Ihe federally 
funded Guaranteed Student Loans. 
National Direct Student Loans and Pell 
Grants. The idea is lo make those 
programs for Ihe neediest of Ihe needy 
But those programs are beginning to 
reach very few students. 

The question is really a mailer ol 
benefits. Whal would immediately 
benefit America in the mosl concrete 
way? 01 course, Ihe answer is simple 
finding monies for defense research and 
materials. Paying for the SIO.OOO boll or 
theSIOO.nooioilel? Whal Ihe magician, in 
his ivory lower on Pennsylvania Avenue, 
is forgetting is that he needs educated 
people lo build and design his national 
defense program. 

Whal he is forgetting is Ihere are 
millions of adull returning students 
raising families and Irying lo pay for 
Iheir own education. However, their 
income bracket is loo high to currently 
qualify for aid, Whal he seems lo be 
forgelling is many people today do not 
pay for Iheir children's education, 
Wliere does Ihal leave Ihe average 
college student'^ 

Yes. America does need an educated 
populace lo build, conslrucl and design 
the -beUer wheel" More likely, 
America will need a highly educated 
populace lo rebuild what is currently 
l&gt;eing destroyed: the ability to allend 
college wilh financial aid if need be. and 
the confidence Ihal you can go lo college 
wilhoul worries of financing thai 
opportunity.

'Dons look for consistency 



Bv DARKEN J. 
VVAGGONER 
Sports Editor 

About a month ago IPFW 
and Ohio State met in the 
championship match of the 
Fort Wayne National Bank 
Volleyball Classic The Amie 
Ball-coached -VoUeydons 
came away with a IS-II, 15- 
in. 15-12 win that night and 
Ball and his crew hoped to 
repeat that performance 
Friday at 7 :30 p.m. when the 
teams meet again in the 
IPFW Multipurpose 
Building, 

IPFW has experienced 
ililficullies in the past two 
weeks. First, York 
University of Canada 
startled the VoUeydons in 
fivegames; and Friday. Ball 
.Slate swept IPFW in three 
^lralehl games. The loss to 
Ball State was twice as 
damaging lo the 'Dons as it 
was their opening Mid- 
western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association 
game. IPFW is now 8-fi and 0- 
I in league play. 

Inconsistency has been the 
thorn in IPFWs side all 
season. The 'Dons played 
well in short spurts against 
Ball Slate, but couldn't 
sustain top-flight play for 
long. Youth and inex- 
perience may be the main 
ingredient causing the up- 
and-down efforts as IPFW 
lias jusl one senior, Fort 
Wayne's Ted Owen, on the 
rosier. 

Two sophomores and three 
{uiilors fill out the starting 
lineup. Ball's bench Is

players proved they could 
play with the nation's best

year. As the season

Has winlor weather 
withered your wits? Is 
television too typical? Ttien 
PIT has the answer lo your 
winter weekend woes. 

■The Homecoming" by 
Harold Pinler opens

'I'linyuward-winning play 
promises lo be not only a- 
lypiciil dI mainstream mid- 
weslern theater, but also 
atypical of theater in 
general 

While not risque' in the 
same sense '-Benf was, the 
production is a daring one 
nonetheless Director Joel 
.Murr.n said that he wants 
hks ^ludience to think atnut

questions about what is 
taking place on the stage 
belorc them, 

II you^re the kind of 
ihealer-goer that wants a 
play lo "just happen to tbem 



. and go liume. (hats all. 
Lade-da we had a good 
time," then this play is not

to think, then this is what 
you're looking for. This is not

motion on the sl;ige ul all. 

The action takes place 
solely within the walls of a 
twusehold in a small town 
north of London in the early 
lo mid-sixties. The plot in- 
volves a family who's 

prodigal' son, a 

philosopher gone lo America 
for six years, has returned. 
The remainder of the play 



entails, almost completely 
through strangely paced 
dialogue, their relationships 
with their son and with each 
other 

The cast consists of 
Michael Bowman, professor 
of communications and 
theatre, as Lenny. James 
Hodgin, asMax, Jim Nelson, 
as Teddy. John Swineharl. 
OS Joey; Jeff Moore, as 
Sam; and Ruth Laruion 
Bowmun, as Ruth. 

The set by Steven T 
Sarralore is well-crafted and 
should compliment Pinter's 
work, as well as the actors' 
performances

Fashion could be right over your head 



The lirst thing one notices 
when meeting a person is 
their hair— particularly its 
color Bach shade we see 
comes with its own set of 



ilt-i 



■xpect 



Everyone has heard bow 
brunettes are intellectual, 
blonds are sexy, and 
redheads are Try. right? 

Kur better or for worse, 
liair is often subconsciously 
taken as a statement about 
one's self. Fortunately, if one 
IS not jiappy with their hair, 
it can lie changed, along with 
tlieir image. 

Iinting is one way to do 
tins Here, color is applied 
ihruughoul the hair lo either 
lighten or darken IL With 
tinting, one can drastically

go from dark brown to blond. 
Tinting does carry with it 
some drawbacks, as Becky 
Miller of Studio II Hair 
Design explained The most 
obvious IS regrowth. Roots 
must lie touched up every 
lew weeks. This problem can 
be minimized d one uses a 
semi -permanent instead of a 
permanent tint. Semi- 
liermanenl colors will fade 
out of the hair gradually over 
a four to six week period. 

Another problem is that 
drastically lightening hair 
can damage it. Tinted hair 
should be protein con- 
ditioned about every ten 

Another approach to hair 
coloring is highlighting The 



basic aim of this process is lo 
achieve a very natural, yet 
brighter and greatly 
enhanced version of one's 
hair. Here, only particular 
sections of hair are colored 
This has its advantages. 
Upkeep Is easier, for 
example, one only has to re- 
highlighi every two to six 
months. 



As I'oma, a stylist from 
Europa Coiffures, explained. 
considerable creativity can 

also go into highlighting. A 
stylist can tailor the
