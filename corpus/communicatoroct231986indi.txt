Software licenses addressed 

Copyrights possibly violated 



ByJOHNMcGAULEY 
Staff Writer 

Concern over possible violations ol 
computer software copyright and 
license agreements on the IPFW 
campus has attracted the attention ol 
the office of Chancellor Thomas P. 
Wallace, prompting a memorandum to 
all faculty and staff on the subject. In 
the memo, dated Oct. 1, Wallace states 
that '"mere have been recent problems 
al this campus with possible violations 
of copyrights and license agreements 
pertaining to reproduction of computer 
programs," 

The copyrights and license 
agreement to which the Wallace 
memo refers are designed 

specifically to insure that computer 
programs are not copied, other than to 
create one or two backup copies, 
without the permission of the author. 

John Carnaghi, vice chancellor for 
Financial Affairs, explained that the 
memo was mainly a reminder to the 
IPFW staff to watch for and avoid 
situations which might be in violation of 
copyright laws. 



"There have been recent problems at this campus with 
possible violations of copyrights and license agreements 
pertaining (o reproduction of computer programs." 

— Chancellor's memo 
—Dated Oct. 1 



However, Carnaghi continued to say 
he had been informed by a student of 
some incidents at IPFW. Also, afler the 
memo was released, he was ap- 
proached by several members of the 
faculty who felt they might be bor- 
dering on violating the copyright of 
some software they were using. 

Carnaghi said he fell the main pur- 
pose of the Chancellor's stalement was 
lo go on record against such activity. 
He continued to say that IPFW "has 
done a good job" protecting the soil- 
ware owned by the school. 

Alan Federman, coordinator of 
academic computing, said the actual 



process of copying computer software 
is "incredibly easy.*' The original copy 
of the computer program is loaded into 
a computer with two disk drives. A 
command is issued to transfer the 
program from the original disk to a 
blank disk in the next drive, with the 
entire process taking only between two 
and three minutes to complete. A 
software package which may cost 
thousands of dollars lo originally 
purchase may be reproduced for only 
three or four dollars, the price of a 
blank disk. 

Federman said there are ways to 
prevent widespread copying of soft- 



ware, mainly by placing statements in 
the actual program that will prohibit 
copying or allow one or two copies. 
However, a student in computers at 
IPFW, who wished not to be identified, 
claimed that programs are available 
that will penetrate these obstacles to 
allow copying, sometimes even 
allowing Ihe program to be modified by 
the user. This same student related an 
incident earlier this year where a 
teacher was forced to rewrite an exam 
after students were able to penetrate 
his computer files and obtain the lest 
answers. &gt; 

Ken Ivan,, a special agent with the 
Fort Wayne office of the FBI, stated 
that if a person is reproducing 
copyrighted computer programs only 
for their personal use, "it would be a 
technical violation (of copyright laws), 
but it's unlikely to be prosecuted." 
However, if an amount of copyrighted 
material in excess of $5000 is copied and 
distributed across stale lines, it 
becomes a felony. He continued to say 
that any copying "could be a violation, 
depending on the extent." 



Policy on cheating found in handbook 



By LILLIAN R. LVON 
Managing Editor 

It's midterm season here at IPFW 
and the tension is mounting; the red ink 
is flowing and the students are 

Unprepa redness for exams and term 
papers is a major problem during 
midterms Students postpone reading 
textbooks, researching papers and 
completing assignments. This 
procrastination leads to last-minute 
panic, which unfortunately often leads 
to cheating and plagiarism. 

Last spring, Ball State University put 
into effeel a student ethics policy which 
explains the steps taken when a student 
is accused of cheating, plagiarizing, or 
academic dishonesty The policy lists 
eight examples of cheating, which 
include copying from a fellow student's 
work, taking exams for another 
student, or working in pairs or groups 
on an exam or test without faculty 
consent; and four examples of 
plagiarism, such as claiming the work 
of another as your own or submitting a 
paper previously handed in in a dif- 
ferent class. Academic dishonesty 
includes cooperating with a fellow 
student in cheating or intentionally 
destroying another student's work. 

IPFW's word on cheating, 
plagiarizing and academic dishonesty 
can be found in the Student Handbook, 
which is distributed in the first issue of 
The Communicator. In this year's 
edition, Purdue University's 



Regulations Governing Student Con- 
duct, Disciplinary Proceedings and 
Appeals begin on page 6, and Indiana 
University's Statement of Students' 
Rights and Responsibilities on page 9. 
Both universities have similar policies. 

Purdue University refers to cheating 
under Section B, Part 2, Subsection a. 
which states, "The following actions 
constitute misconduct for which 
students may be subject to ad- 
ministrative action or disciplinary 
penalties, a. Dishonesty in connection 
with any University activity. Cheating, 
plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing 
false information to the university are 
examples of dishonesty. 

"The commitment of the acts of 
cheating, lying, stealing, and deceit in 
any of their diverse forms isuch as the 
use of ghost-written papers, the use of 
substitutes for taking examinations, Ihe 
use of illegal cribs, plagiarism, and 
copying during examinations) is 
dishonest and must not be tolerated. 
Moreover, knowingly lo aid and abet, 
directly or indirectly, other parties in 
committing dishonest acts is in itself 
dishonest." Procedures for dealing 
with infractions of this stalement are 
found in section C, Parts 1 through 7. 
Appeals can be made according to 
Section D. 

Indiana University lists cheating 
under Section I, Part 1.13, Subsection 
a. 4: "The following actions constitute 
misconduct for which sludents may be 
penalized, by such sanctions as 




Photo illustration by 

described in 1.13 (c), when committed 
on university property: ... (4) 
Academic dishonesty, such as cheating 
and plagiarism; knowingly furnishing 
false information; and forgery, 
alteration, or unauthorized use of 
university documents, records, iden- 
tification, or property." Disciplinary 
procedures are similar to Purdue's and 
arc found in section II; appeals 
procedures are in Section II, Part 2.5.

When a professor suspects a student 
of cheat ing-plagi arizing, following the 
proper channels will lead to a hearing 
through the Office of the Dean of 
Student Services, according lo Ihe 
Studenl Handbook. Sludents who are 
found guilty face probation, suspension, 
expulsion, or a disciplinary penalty 
imposed by the Dean of Student Ser- 



IPFW program defines women's issues 



.

'•* .*v 









Linda Fox 

By M1CHELE R. SHAFFER 
Editor-in-Chief 

The way women think and feel is a 
different phenomenon than men's 
experiences. 

That philosophy is the cornerstone for 
a fairly young program al IPFW — 
women's studies, 

"Our mission is to educate Ihe 
university and community about 
women's issues in an academic en- 
vironment," said Linda Fox, coor- 
dinator of the 10-year-old program. 

The idea of a women's studies 
program al IPFW originated in the 
early 1970's as classes were offered 
occasionally, Fox said. An ad hoc 
commitlee comprised of faculty, 
students, and community members 
was later formed lo propose a women's 
studies minor The idea was approved. 
"The moving force for all of this, the ad 



hoc committee which did propose the 
minor, was Dr. Cathryn Adamsky," 
Fox said. 

Adamsky was formerly an associate 
professor of psychology al IPFW, She 
has since been promoted to professor of 
women's studies and teaches at the 
University of New Hampshire. 

The women's studies in- 
terdisciplinary minor available to all 
arts and letters sludents and science 
and humanities students requires 
students to take the introductory 
course, WOST W200, Women in 
American Culture. Four additional 
courses are required lo complete the 15- 
hour minor. Next spring WOST W200 
and nine other interdisciplinary classes 
will be offered. 

The women's studies minor is im- 
portant and useful, said Fox, because 
one-half of the population is female, 
"Any job that deals with women ... 
obviously one-half the population you 
will come into coniact with ... there 
needs lo be a sensitivity lo women," 
Fox said. "I don't care if you're a 
woman or a man." 

Society is just trying to escape the 
1%0's attitude that women are not 
capable of the same things men are 
capable of doing, Fox said. One of the 
big problems facing women, she said, is 
that many women were never in- 
troduced to the fact that women per- 
ceive things differently than men. "I 
was never sensitized lo women's issues, 
so my own senses, feelings were never 
validated," she said. "The university 
was a very male place lo be in the 
I960's." Fox continued, detailing a 
story of how she walked out of her math 
final ready tn gel sick, because she got 



so worked up thinking women were not 
capable of thinking mathematically. 

"Thank goodness we're beyond that. 
A lot of this is cultural attitude," she 
said. "And attitudes die very hard. We 
have policies (harrassment policies), 
but policies don't change attitudes." 

Although hampered by budgetary 
problems, class scheduling problems 
and lingering adverse altitudes in some 



people, the program has grown. There 
are currently about 55 to 60 people 
enrolled in women's studies classes this 
fall. There are about 30 people 
currently declaring a women's studies 
minor. Fox said there is a possibility of 
the program reaching 200 sludents nexl 
semester, since 10 classes are being 
offered.

Tuition program offered 
for January assembly 



By LILLIAN LYON 
Managing Editor 

What is BEST? According to Indiana 
Stale Representative Mitch Harper of 
Fort Wayne, BEST is a way of insuring 
your child's college education. 

Students today face high tuition costs, 
and affording a college education can 
be a difficult task. Last year, James 
Blanchard, governor of Michigan, 
proposed the state adopt BEST — the 
Baccalaureate Education System Trust 
— as the first program in the country to 
guarantee a child's college tuition by 
investing a specific amount of money in 
the child's name in a specially adapted 
slate fund. The tuition cost is 
guaranteed for four year's un- 
dergraduate study at any public 
Michigan college. 

Harper is working toward In- 
troducing BEST to the Indiana House of 
Representatives for consideration as a 
legislative bill in their January 1987 

With BEST, according to Harper. 



parents could choose lo invest a lump 
sum or periodic payments. Payments 
could be made annually, bi-weekly, or 
through payroll deductions, after the 
birth of the child. The stale would then 
invest the money in securities in con- 
junction with private investment 
managers and state money managers. 
The amount of the investment required 
would be adjusted periodically to 
protect the overall soundness of the 
fund. No stale tax dollars would be 

Harper notes the major advantages 
of the program as: one, the child is 
guaranteed full tuition in any state 
university, two, if the student chooses a 
private college, the monetary 
equivalent lo public college tuition will 
be paid in full; three, possible federal 
and state lax exemption on the interest 
earnings and subsequent tuition value; 
and four, a separate fund for oul-of- 
state parents who want their children to 
attend an Indiana stale university.

Exercise your rights, 
and exercise your body 



Last weekend and for the next two 
weekends, the hours at the Multipurpose 
Building have been extended. Why? 
Because members of Students' 
Government received several requests 
from part-time students who wanted to 
use the building but could only do so on 
(he weekend. 

It seems a valid complaint. The part- 
lime students pay a student activities 
foe Part of that money goes to the use of 
the Multipurpose Building facilities. But 
when do these people get to use it? 

Many of them work days and go to 
school nights. The building closes at 9 
p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, and 
5 p.m. on Fridays. 

Representatives of the Students' 
Government took this information and 
the students' requests to members of the 
IPFW administration — including 
members of the Athletic Department. 
The students' government 

representatives also investigated the 
cost of keeping the building open on 
weekends and say the cost is minimal, 
compared to the advantages to the 
student 

The administration apparently 
juggled with the idea for a few months 
and decided to keep the Multipurpose 
Building open on weekends on a trial 
basis only, to see if there really is a need 
for the expenditure 

That's ail well and good but they made 
no visible attempt to let students know 
they were planning on keeping the 
building open those weekends (Oct 18- 
19, Oct. 25-26, Nov. 1-2-). There was no 
memo sent to this newspaper, which 
most agree is the predominant means of 



communication on campus between 
administration and students. 

Members of students' government 
found out the building would be kept 
open about one week before that first 
weekend. That is hardly enough time to 
plan any advertisement or plan of 
strategy to let students know the place 
will be available those weekends. 

It doesn't make sense. How are 
students supposed to know they can use 
the building if they don't know it will be 
kept open for their use? 

Perhaps university officials feel it 
should be the role of students' 
government to advertise and promote 
this trial period. There is a problem with 
that logic. Students' government is not, 
by nature, a marketing body Sure. 
they made the request, but they do not 
have the money or the bodies to properly 
publicize the trial dates. Even if they did 
have the resources, they could not be 
expected to pull off the advertisement 
for the first weekend successfully with 
only a week's notice. 

It sounds as if the administration is 
either patronizing the student's 
government or undermining the trial 
period. It almost sounds as if some of our 
administration are saying "We'll let you 
students try it, but we know it won't 
work because it was already tried 
before " 

Our answer to that is that this 
semester's students are different from 
those a few semesters ago. They pay for 
the use of that facility. Give them a 
chance to exercise both their rights and 
their bodies.

Volleydons, department 
commended on success 



r— Letters to the Editor 



The 14 members of the IPFW women's 
volleyball team, often referred to as the 
Volleydons, are slowly but surely 
establishing a name for the IPFW 
athletic program. 

The Mastodons have compiled an 
undefeated conference record, as of Oct. 
21. At the same time they have hovered 
in and out of the NCAA Division II Top 20 
rankings for the entire season. 
Currently, they are 15th. 

The team is looking forward to the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference 
Championships to be held Nov. 21 and 22, 
The conference is divided into a north 
and a south division, with the top two 
teams in each section competing for the 
championship. 

Thirteen of the current players are 
Allen County natives and with many of 
their local friends and family attending 
the matches, attendance should be up 

In recent years, Arnie Ball, head 
coach, has been able to limit his 
recruiting efforts to the local area but as 
(he team gains more recognition the 



local talent supply will become more 
limited. 

Soon scouts from across the Midwest 
will swamp the area in search of a share 
of Allen County's talent. This will most 
likely force Ball to concentrate harder 
on his neighboring states' recruiting 
efforts. The fact that the school is doing 
any recruiting at all is a tremendous 
improvement from recent years. 

We encourage all IPFW students to 
use their student I.D.'s and attend the 
games. The Volleydons have worked 
hard to be one of the top teams in the 
area and their work will pay off if the 
students turn out to see them play There 
are six games left, in addition to the 
GLVC Cluster Tourney Saturday at 12:30 
p.m. at IPFW Show the team your 
support and attend. 

IPFWs athletic department should be 
commended for proving that they really 
care about the team's success. IPFW 
now seems more like an independent 
university rather than "by-pass high 
school" as many had so affectionately 
come to call it in recent years. 




Solutions offered 

To Ihe Editor: 
Apparently many are 

wondering why enrollment is 
down two percent and that 
apathy pervades this 
campus like a bad cold. You 
want to change things 
around here at IPFW, here's 
what you've got to do: 

1 Build a dormitory close 
to the student union. (You 
know whereabouts).' That 
animal laboratory building 
has to be the biggest non- 
sense I've ever heard of. 
What a waste of time, 
energy, and money. What an 
on-campus residency 
program might well solve is 
the lack of activity on 
campus and instill a little 
pride in this place for once. 
Plus, il might be a return on 
your money 

2 Move some classes from 
Keltlennlo Walb tor reasons 
previously mentioned in this 
newspaper (how many 
people live in the basement 
of Kettler?). 

3 Market image of IPFW 
as a real college, not just 
some commuter extension of 
high. 1 realize, that for 
many, this is a low-cost 
alternative lo Bloomington 
or West Lafayette, but that 
doesn't mean we have lo be 
treated like Brand X 
students, do we? 

4. Get rid of the Mastodon 



(for 



ason 



obvi 



to 



related 
extinct pachyderm I. 

5. Form a football learn? 
Hardly a solution What with 
already two nationally 
ranked teams on campus 
mat tew people seem lo care 
about, think about justifying 
Ihe expense o( a football 
team that will, most likely, 
be hammered every 



Saturday into a pulp, ac- 
complishing little at best. 

6. Get somebody to syn- 
chronize the blessed clocks, 
for gosh sakes ... 

7. Think about getting 
liberal arts reemphasized. 
Business majors alone does 
not a university make 
Contrary lo popular belief. 
liberal arts are important, 
and I'm also sure they're 
tired of being a hapless 
minority .. „„ , 

Obviously, these. solutions 
require no small sum of 
money But in Ihe long run, 
think of it as an investment 
of faith that the midwest will 
recognize Ihe product the 
people of Fort Wayne and 
IPFW can generate to the 
administration of IPFW. I 
ask: If you can't do that, 
what are you trying to do 



Vole on Nov. 4 

To the Editor, 

It's rare that single events 
can change the course of 
world history. It's rarer still 
when students can play an 
important role in such 
events. The Nov 4 elections 
can fundamentally alter our 
future. Indeed, Ihese elec- 
tions can determine whether 
there is a future at all 

Voting provides the op- 
portunity for students to 
make our views kn 
vital issui 



fai 



,ng the 



country We can also give 
them clout by helping elect a 
Congress thai shares our 

Today's student activism 
reflects the conscience of our 
nation. Millions of people 
oppose the arms build-up, 
apartheid, intervention in 



Central America, cutbacks 
in student aid and other 
social programs and new 
levels of racism and 
discrimination On these 
issues we share the sen- 
timents of ihe overwhelming 
majority of the U.S. people. 
It is the Reagan Ad- 
nnniiiriiiion and its sup- 
porters thai are out of step 
with the people of our 
country and the world 

■For. 4&gt;ix ..-years students 
haye, l befui..laking it;,oft,the.. 
chin. During the Reagan 
presidency tuition has gone 
up 34 percent. Every year we 
fight administration at- 
tempts lo impose deep cuts 
in student aid The funds 
axed from these and other 
social programs is diverted 
to the astronomically ex- 
pensive arms build-up. This 
includes Reagan's Star Wars 
program that will cost an 
estimated one trillion dollars 
over the next five years. 

Today we have real 
possibilities lo end the 
nuclear arms race. But by 
their actions in Iceland the 
Reagan administration has 
blocked ihis process As Rep 
Ed Markey of Massachusetts 
said. "The president has senl 
the world a message that he 
does not want arms control 
and thai he has pul his faith 
in the Stardust moonbeams 
of his Star Wars fantasies." 

Eighty percent of Ihe 
people of the US support a 
nuclear tesl ban The House 
recently voled for a 
moratorium on all but Ihe 
smallest nuclear explosions. 
A majority also apposes Star 
Wars. The IB-month Soviet 
moratorium on nuclear 
testing means a historic 
agreement is within reach. 

The administration can be 
compelled to reverse its 



disastrous course. But to do 
this, we need a change in the 
political balance in 
Congress. This November, 
wc can do that, by electing a 
pro-peace and pro-people 
majority lo the U.S. Senate. 
What we do from now until 
Nov 4 to ensure a maximum 
turnoul of the 12 million 
possible student voters can 
make the difference. We, the 
undersigned past and 
-present student leaders urge 
"that every effort be made to 
inspire our friends and 
fellow students lo vote 



generado 



against candidates who 
support Reagan's policies. 
Nov. 4 is a chance to serve 
ihe cause of peace and to

Campus recruitment service 
helps seniors find employment 

Placement office sponsors 
on-campus job interviews 



By STACEY SC1IAAB 
Staff Writer 

What can campus 
recruiting alter the un- 
dergraduate? What exactly 
is campus recruiting? 

Campus recruitment is 
offered to all students 
planning to graduate trom 
IPFW. An initial interview 
session is conducted for 
qualified students with 
companies invited to IPFW 
by the office of Counseling, 
Testing and Placement. 
After first interviews are 
conducted on campus, 



candidates are then selected 
tor second level interviews 
at the company offices. 

recruiting, what else does 
the office of counseling, 
testing and placement have 
to offer students? Workshops 
are offered on various 
subjects such as resume 
writing and interviewing. 
They also have directories of 
businesses and industries, 
college placement annuals, 
and job vacancy listings 
from local, state and 
national companies. 



Available to all students is 
a resume referral and a 
career library. The career 
library service Is for 
students who are unsure of 
what career to pursue. 
Counseling is also available. 
In addition, salary in- 
formation can be found for 
various Jobs. 

Alumni shadowing Is also a 
valuable source for 
students. Alumni from IPFW 
are eager to help soon-to-be 
graduates. Alumni can in- 
form undergraduates of 
problems encountered on 



their way up the career 

The office of counseling, 
testing and placement also 
offers employer literature 
files, brochures, flyers and 
annual reports from over 
one- thousand companies. 

"It is extremely important 
to research a company 
before an interview or 
writing a cover letter so the 
student will appear as 
professional as possible," 
said Linda Scott, Counselor 
Coordinator of Placement 
Services.

(Continued from Page D 
The amount of the In- 
vestment would depend upon 
four factors: age of (he child, 
payment plan chosen, date of 
I entry, and option for 
separating from the fund. 
Three payment plans would 
[ be offered: 

. Plan A: tax exempt 
securities, the most ex- 
pensive option. Parents who 
choose to separate from the 
fund would receive some 
interest on the investment. 
2. Plan B: the least ex- 
pensive option, where 
parents who choose to 
separate from the plan 



receive the money invested 
with no gain or loss. 

3. Plan C: taxable 
securities, a middle cost 
option. Parents who 
separate from the plan 
receive the investment and 
some fund earnings, but 
must pay tax consequences. 

Supervision of the BEST 
fund would be by public 
authority and participation 
is strictly voluntary. 

Legislation for the 
programshould be drafied in 
time for action during the 
upcoming General Assembly 
Session in January, 1987. 



and participating in 
Awareness Week so im- 
portant? To be responsible, 
we need to know facts, not 
myths about alcohol. All 
those prep courses won't 
help the student who gets 
behind the wheel thinking 
he's had "just a few beers." 
Far too many accidents are 
caused by such misin- 
formation. Maybe that's why 
50 percent of all driving 
fatalities are caused by 
drunk drivers. And why two- 
thirds of all those arrested 
for DWI "just had beer " 

Knowing some other 
common sense college 
survival tips may also save 
lives during the school year: 

1. Don't drive after your 
next tailgate party or happy 
hour — whether you've had 
beer, wine or spirits. One 
American dies in an alcohol- 
related traffic accident 
every thirty-five minutes. 
Better walk an extra mile or 
spend the night at a friend's 
than risk taking lives on the 
road. 

2. Eat something — never 
drink on an empty stomach. 
Eat before you go to a party, 
eat while you're there. Solid 
food like cheese can slow 
down the alcohol absorption 
rate. If you're throwing a 
party, serve lots of munchies 
and plenty of 

3. Don't be pushed into 
drinking more than you can 
handle and don't pressure 
your friends to keep up with 



you. Everyone has an in- 
dividual tolerance. Let your 
friends pace themselves. 

4. Keep a watchful eye; 
Cocktails should contain no 
more than IV, ounces of 
spirits, wine is commonly no 
more than a 5 ounce serving 
and a typical serving of beer 
is 12 ounces. If you're mixing 
your own drink, use a shot 
glass to measure your liquor. 

5. Know yourself — and 
your mood. If you rarely 
drink, chugging a few beers 
will affect you faster than it 
would affect someone who is 
accustomed to drinking. 
Your mood can also in- 
fluence the way you react to 
a drink. If you're depressed 
over a test, drinking will 
depress you further. 

Just as there are helpful 
tips to remember, there are 
also some common and 
dangerous myths about 
alcohol that should be 
dispelled: 

1, Myth No. l: You can 
pace yourself by switching: 
from liquor to beer or .wine, 
Wrong. You consume the 
same amount of alcohol — 
and can get just as drunk — 
from the most common 
servings of beer, wine and 
liquor. 

2. Myth No. 2: Coffee can 



sober you up if you're drunk. 
Wrong again. Coffee may 
wake you up, but it won't 
sober you up. If you drink 
one too many and then have 
a cup of coffee and drive, you 



are just a wide-awake drunk 
behind the wheel Also. 
taking a cold shower won't 
do the trick either. That's 
only going to make you a wet 
drunk. 



Women's studies 



(Continued Trom Paget) 
But, she said, the 

budgetary problems will still 
exist The women's studies 
program operates on an 
annual budget (for spring 
and fall semesters) of $2100. 
That figure excludes clerical 
wages, and takes care of 
operating expenses only, 
Fox said. It pays for 
telephone rental, typewriter 
service contract, magazine 
subscriptions, upkeep of the 
program's resource library, 
and faculty travel. Like 
other departments, the 
program does get a library 
allotment to request certain 
periodicals or books &gt;to be., 
ordered for Helmke Library,, 
That budgeted amount for 
library expenditures is $393. 
Fox said the department is 
also given money to hire a 
part-time associate faculty 
member to leach the in- 
troductory class. Beyond 
that, none of the other 
classes are guaranteed. 



"The rest is Up to the 
chairpersons of departments 
to offer classes that have 
enough to be cross- lis ted 
with women's studies," Fox 
said. "They have their own 
programs to think about and 
that's a problem," she said. 
Bui Fox remains 
dedicated to women's 
studies. She proudly an- 
nounced that the first 
graduate of Ihe In- 
dividualized Major Program 
just finished school. Mary 
Louise Love. Fox said Love 
combined a political science 
major with women's studies 
for her individualized major. 
That program. Fox said, is 
coordinated by Jeanette 



Clai 



chair 



of the 



department of modern 
foreign languages. Clausen 
was formerly the coor- 
dinator or the women's 
studies program for five' 
years before Fox took over in 
1981.

PAL Offers Self -Defense 



By NATALIE ALCOX 

Features Editor 

The Police Athletic League 

is sponsoring a self-defense 



course for women. The 
course is going to be held 
Oct. 23 and Oct. 30 at 6 p.m. 
The classes will be held at 



Z12I Olladale Drive. Persons 
interested or with any 
questions, should call P.A.L. 
at 432-4122. 




One of every three women 
can expect to be attacked 
sometime in her life ac- 
cording to the F.B.I. This 
makes it extremely im- 
portant that a woman is 
of the dangers and 
can protect herself ac- 
cordingly. 

"The worst thing a person 
can do," claims Sgt. 
Atkinson of the Fort Wayne 
Police department, "is 
panic. A person can lose 
their train of thought, their 
life flashes before them. But 
you have to make a decision 
and that decision has to be 
right." 

The idea, according to Sgt. 
Atkinson, is to keep things as 
simple as possible and use 



"Does Anybody Care for a Nap?" 

This young person Is certainly enjoying the last vestiges of summertime. Sleeping in the sun 
upon a parkbench is something we may nol have another chance to do until the spring thaw. 
Hopefully spring will come early so everyone might have the chance to laze in the sun 
(Photo by Mark New). 



"We try to leach how you 
can come out on top if faced 
with a dangerous situation." 

The class will teach 
women how to deal with 
three different types of 
abuse. Women will learn how 
to handle verbal abuse, 
hands on abuse, and an at- 
tacker who threatens you 
with a knife, gun or other 
weapon. 

There are approximately 
110 women in each class. The 
classes are taught twice a 
year, once in the spring then 
again in the fall. 



Women believe 
they are invincible 



ByNATAL IE ALCOX 

Feature* Editor 
"It won't happen to me." 
This is a common myth that 
a great many women seem 
to believe. Unfortunately 
this makes them easy prey 
for muggers, rapists and 
other attackers who sense 
their vulnerability. 



Commentary 



Why women insist that "it 
happens to other people" 
when statistics prove that it 
can happen to anyone is a 
mystery. 

One of every three women 
will be attacked some time in 
her life. Let's put this on a 
more personal level. Next 
time you walk in a room 
count the number of women 
in it. Then divide by three. 
Do you know any of these 
females? Is your girlfriend 



among them? Or possibly 
your mother? 

Us past time people 
realized that it's a dangerous 
world we live in and it's not, 
"unfemlnine," or "too 
masculine" to defend our- 

Females will openly admit 
to being afraid if they are 
alone on a dark alley and a 
stranger is approaching 
them. But how many will do 
anything to alleviate those 
fears? Few women want to 
admit that it could happen to 
them So they don't bother 
taking self-defense that 
might prepare them to deal 
with an attacker 

Of course I'm probably not 
telling you anything new. 
Everyone knows women: 
don't like to admit that they 
are vulnerable They'd; 
rather take their chances; 
than prepare themselves for: 
that eventuality. 

A potential rapist know, 
the odds. 

Think about it. 



Schizophrenia is misunderstood due to some misconceptions 



By NATALIE ALCOX 
Features Editor 
"You turn other people off 
as you tune into yourself, and 
your thinking is blurred. It is 
frightening and atlract|ve al 
the same time. You 
sometimes see, hear, and 
experience things that your 
runaway thinking tells you is 
real, evenwhen others say it 
isn't. You try to sort it all out 
in your head and give it some 
order, but your mind con- 
tinues to play tricks on you 
So it seems to you that people 
intrude, talk around you and 



blame you for so many 
things. They are not to be 
trusted. You are left feeling 
scared, angry, alone, con- 
fused, and hurting so much 
that you believe you are 
beyond help or hope in find- 
ing _ solutions to your 
problems." 

These words were stated 
by a person with 
schizophrenia. 

Schizophrenia is a serious 
mental disorder that effects 
one out of every 100 people. It 
is most common in early 
adulthood after a young 



person has made a number 
of unsuccessful adjustments 
to life, according to Daniel 
Patterson, M.D.. M.Ph. 

Unfortunately, it has been 
determined that a person 
can have a genetic 
disposition to schizophrenia 
The general public has a 1 
percent chance of developing 
schizophrenia. If your 
parents, however, or a 
brother or sister has it your 
chances move up fo 12 
percent, or roughly one out 
of ten. 

If both parents have it or 



your identical twin has it 
your chances are about 50 
percent. 

There are several 
misconceptions about 
schizophrenia. The most 
common misconception 
about schizophrenia is that it 
is the same thing as "split 
personality." It is not. Split 
personality is a 

psychological disorder. 
Schizophrenia is a psychotic 
disorder. 

Another misconception is 
that people with 

.schizophrenia are dangerous 



to society. This is untrue. 
Considering the fact that 
most schizophrenics are 
afraid of people it wouldn't 
be very likely that they 
would aggressively attack 
someone. The rare instances 



when 



vith 



hizophrenia did attack 
someone was when the 
schizophrenic thought he 
was being attacked 

What are the symptoms of 
schizophrenia? First the 
individual may not appear to 
be the same person that he 
was He may be more 
suspicious of others, more 
sensitive, less independent. 
He may be more outgoing or 
more withdrawn 

Secondly, the individual 
may lose interest in life. He 
retreats from life The with- 



drawal may be so gradual 
that no one may notice it at 
first 

Lastly the person may look 
less alert, have difficulty 
concentrating, productivity 
may lessen. He may also feel 
less hopeful, unsure of 
succeeding in anything. 

Not all symptoms appear 
in all people having 
schizophrenia. Many times 
no symptoms appear at all 
until an "episode" occurs. 

One of the biggest 
problems for someone 
having schizophrenia is the 
inability to think clearly. His 
thinking is like a television 
sel with a faulty picture. He 
may be convinced that 
others have control over his 
thoughts, that he can "pick 
iges that no one 



else can. A small insigificant 
occurrance can lake on 
added meaning for someone 
with schizophrenia. For 
example a car horn blowing 
in the distance is a signal 
from the FBI to flee. He has 
unreal perceptions of the 
world known as 

"hallucinations." He may 
hear voices This, of course, 
frightens the person with 
schizophrenia just as much 
as it would frighten you or 1. 

the emotions a 
schizophrenic experiences 
may not be consistent with 
Ihe situation. Regardless of 
the terror he feels internally 
a person with schizophrenia 
may laugh uncontrollably. 
Or he may not show any 
emotion at all. 

Also his behavior changes. 
He may be seeing something 
in his mind that's not really 
there but that will not stop 



him from reacting to it. Thus 
causing inappropriate 
behavior. 

Unfortunately there is no 
cure for schizophrenia, only 
controls. The biggest and 
most helpful control is 
medication. Symptoms of 
schizophrenia are controlled 
in 7 out of 10 cases with 
medication alone. Coun- 
seling has a 3 out of 10 ratio. 
The most successful means 
of controlling schizophrenia 
is using medication and 
counseling at the same time. 
Then symptoms can be 
controlled in 8 out of 10 
people. 

Although there is no cure 
now, hopefully research will 
be able to discover 
something to help the four 
and half million people who 
are suffering from this 
disease.

makers use words like 
reflection, knowledge and 
experience to describe the

more There was a painful 
lack of chemistry between 
the leading actors. Kathleen

case of local kids doing well, 
because Ihe Volleydons. 11-3 
this year, claimed the No 19 
slot in the first NCAA

referring to the laleni pool in 
the Fort Wayne area "The 
coaching al the high school
