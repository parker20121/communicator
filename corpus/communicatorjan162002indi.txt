Last year, "Atlas' Cigar" 
won the One-Act Pl.ivwriting 
Competition at the KL7ACTF 
competition. 

This year the play will 
compete for Ihe chance to go

possibility," 

Brcitcnbach said "Atlas' 
Cigar" "is a play that ciplorcs 
the modern American cduca- 
tional system and Ihc problems 
withm that system. It also looks 
at some of Ihc issues surround- 
ing school violence." 

According to Breitenbach, Ihe 
play was written because she 
wanted to go back and look at 
my experience in school, which 
didn't go well — I never finished 
my sophomore year. And I 
wanted to look at all of the dif- 
ferent perspectives. It was just a 
story I needed to tell.

STARs to tour campus 



By Andy Wclfle, Reporter 

You may have seen them 
around Ihe campus. Little yel- 
low flyers wilh silhouettes of 
people, looking up at the 
words: "Recruiting; Student 
Admissionl^eprcsenlatives," 

Who are the Student 
Admission Representatives? 
VVhen asked, Laura Harmon, 
assistant director of admissions 
and also Ihc coordinator of the 
STARs program, said, "They 
provide tours for prospective 
students and their families 
when a student comes to the 
campus for a college visit. 

"A lot of juniors and seniors 



jin high school] come out here 
to meet Iwiih a STAR! They 
would talk with an admissions 
counselor and take the student 
on a tour of Ihe campus. It lakes 
about an hour." 

The students who participate 
in the STARs program ,ilso 
attend leadership seminars. 

"They meet once a month," 
Harmon said. "This is kind of a 
perk of Ihc program, because it 
IS all volunteer work. We have a 
packet called an 'Ambassador 
Kit.' We try to focus on one of 
Ihc brochures [inside Ihe kit] 

"Leading Ihe Way." "Meet

Campus Hockey Club seeks players 



By Andy WelHe. Reporter 

Lynn Vardaman is a man with 
a mission. His love of hockey 
and coaching' young adults 
inspired him lo create a hockey 
team at IPFW. 

"Tlicre is [in Fort Wayne) no 
outlet for playing hockey com- 
petitively out of high school," 
Vardaman said, while driving to 
Evansvilte with his team. 

"Many students need a higher 
level of competition than what 
community teams can provide." 

Technically. Vardaman's 

hockey team is more of a club 
than a team. The IPFW athletic 
department cannot provide Ihe 
necessary funding for such a 
team. Vardaman looked else- 
where and finally found a solu- 
tion in Student Life. 

"We have all the student offi- 
cers — president, vice-president, 
secretary and treasurer." 
eiplaincd Vardaman. He is in 
the process of raising 540,000- 
50,000 for next year's budget. 
This year, in the early stages of 
the growing club, members who 
wish to ptav on the team have lo 
pay around S500 to cover costs. 

"People who don't skale, but 
love hockey, can be a member, 
too,' saj-s Vardaman. "TTie cost 
U only S5.- 

Vardaman has high aspira- 
tions for the hockey club for next 



year. He hopes to play 50 to 55 

fames during the season and 
old at least half of them in Fort 
Vl^yne, He plans to use the rink 
at either Ihe Coliseum or 
McMillan, and is "having di.s- 
cussions wilh the |jtaff at thi 
Coliseum." 

Although Iheir ton base is not 
as big as Vardaman wants it to 
be. he does not see tliat as a 
drawback, "Not too many peo- 
ple know about the hockev club 
yet," Vardaman said. 

He believes that once Ihu 
leani develops and expands, 
hockey fans will start coming to 
the games to support the team. 

'We hope lo draw 500 to 1000 
people," says Vardaman. 

The IPFW hockey Icam. the 
Mastodons, are already sanc- 
tioned by The American 
Collegiate Hockey Association 
in Divisioii II, along wilh 
Indiana University, Michigan 
State, University of Michigan 
and Bowling Green, as welfas 
over 100 other colleges around 
Ihe country. 

Last iveekend, Vandaman and 
the team went lo Evansville lo 
compete against the University 
of Southern Indiana. They 
played two games, earning a vic- 
tory each time. Game scores 
were 9-0 and 10-1, respectively 
. Tryouls for the next year's 
team are tentatively scheduled

What is your New Year's Resolution?" 




"Stop using my charge cards!" 
Allie Canfield - Sophomore 



"I don't make them because I don't usually 
stick to them." 

Jason Fenker - Senior 



Human sexuality and personhood 

Snce this is a papvr for a college umptis. I con only hope (o guess that everyone would 
agree with me when I sjy ihal jcx is a wondetful thing. 

Human set is unlike any kind of sex found anyivhcie in the animal tdngdmn. The 
human body is diflercnt from the bodies of aniin;il£. which leads lo several inleivsttng 
observatons. 

Humans are the only creatures to have seK fnce-to-taw. Further, humans are the only 
creatures with erogenous zones away from their gcrutals and entirely on the front side of 
their body. A woman's breasts first arc an erogenous ^onc and s.'cond a ivay to iiurK young. 

The basic and fundamental difference between animal se&lt; and human sex is that 
human sex involves personhood. Human sex is designed to provide maximum enjoyment, 
not just to make babies. 

Animal sex consists of only brie/ genital -lo-geoital contact, while humansex consists of 
prolonged ivhole-body- to- whole-body contact. Some animals ""go pink," at which lime they 
aremoslfcrtileandsearchfor opportunities to mate.. '\ human is capable ofarausal at any 
lime and a woman can become more aroused at times when she is not likely to become 
pregnant. ' 

To me, it's obvious that something i* dilfcrcnt with human sex. Humans an- designed 
lo have a whole-body relationship, not just brief sexual encounters. Humans desire to be 
considered a person and to have a person- lo-person relationship. 

When you remove the relationship from a sexual relationship, several things happeix. 
Perversion, enters into play. Inipotenc)'. which is experienced by one-lhinj of all American 
men at some point, is caused by psychological factors approximately 90 percent of the 

Homosexuality, wilh the removal of face-to- 
face, person-to- person contact, provides a quick 
opporturuty to satisfy desires rooted in sex. 

The bottom line is Ihal hunians are not 
interested in sex solely for the purpose of repro- 
duction. Humans want and need full-body, pcr- 
i-to-person rclatior\ships. The removal of the 
personhood of a human results in animalistic 
instincls. 

To thoseof you who ate women, God made you special and gave you the ability to 
enjoy sex lo the fullest when you aren't likely lo get pregnant. You're oble lo enjoy sex much 
more than a chimp, tvho will have sexual contact for 30 seconds and then is lucky if a ses- 
sioa of social grooming occurs afterv.'ard. 

You were designed with erogenous zones unlike any animal so Ihal you might And hd- 
fillmeni in sex and not be sought after as simply a sex object. 

To those of you who are men, you need to realise that personhood is imporlanl. Do not 
heat your wife with the same disrespect with which the mole chimp treats his lover. 

Don't forget the importance ol personhood and don't forget just why it is that you were 
created differently from a chimpanzee.

Adults crave long-lost holiday magic 



By Stephanie Sample, Staff Writer 

Do you remember the way the holi- 
days used to be tvhen you where a kid? 
It's easy to forget the eicitement, the 
wonder, the magic, the total unapolo- 
gelic hedonism that engulfed us as it got 
doser and closer lo Dec. 25, 

For most of us, just walching the 
children in our own families is enough lo 
make us envy the youth and innocence 
that makes them so wide-eyed and 
happy at even a glimpse of a stack ot 
pn^sents or a fake Santa Glaus. 

So now, in the aflermalh ol yet 
another Christmas season, 1 begin to 
wonder. Can we, as adults, recapture the 
same holiday feelings that we once had 
as children? Aflcr painstakingly ponder- 
ing Ihis issue, I have come lo a bitter- 
sweet conclusion. 

Absolutely not. Christmas is for 
children. We've already had our turn. 
The entire kid calendar year revolves 
around Dec. 25. In a world that is already 
new, massive and full of magic, 
Christmas is the frosting on the cake. 

Christmas appeals to all of a child's 
senses; The sight of the Christmas tree 
protcctmg their slash of presents, the 
smell of apples and cinnamon that seems 
to linger evcryivhcre. the lasle of warm 
Christmas cookies straichi from the 
oven, the Christmas carols Ihat aren't 
annoying yet and the way it feels to tear 
open gift alter gift. For a cnild, Christmas 
is theclwesl they hnveever come to pure 
orgasmic pleasure. 

Children arc free ol adult ^vorries- 
They are oblivious lo the stress of bills, 
jobs and romantic relationships. In their 
eyes. Mommy is still the world's greatest 
healer and Daddy can fix anything. (He 
can also beat up your daddy.) — '" 



complexity. We are less moved by the lit- 
tle things that were once enough to bring 
elation. We are too worried about the 
day-lo-day issues making up our lives. 

For adults. Christmas is oiten the 
antithesis of what it once was as chil- 
dren. It can be a holiday full of pressure 
and stress. Finding the money to buy all 
of those presents, preparing for the bar- 
rage ol friends and relatives who plan lo 
slop by and try to make Ihis Christmas 
"pprlccl" all take precedence over really 
enjoying the holiday, 

l-lerein lies the very reason that 
adults are incapable of recapturing that 
Christmas magic. We have this picture in 
our mind of what the perfect Christmas 
is. In my mind. It looks sometfung like 
Ihe Norman Rockwell plates that my 
grandmother has in her dining room— a 
room in ivhich, ironically, we only eat in 
at Christmas. 

No matter what your vision of Ihe 
ideal Christmas is, it probably looks 
something like a warm, happy family 
eating a delicious holiday dinner or 
opening presents around a tree. 
Unfortunately, real life looks nothing like 
a Norman Rockwell painting or any of 
Ihe many sugary-sweet holiday movies 
we watch each year. 

Real lile and real families are 
cjuirky. You probably don'l like everyone 
in your family. Every family has that one 
really weird relative who makes bad 
jokes or looks like he came off an episode 
of Jerry Springer, 

As children, we are less aware of 
our family's dowivfalls because we still 
see them as perfect. As we age. we begin 
to see the members of our family as real 
people who arc not even close lo perfec- 
tion. A family full of imperfect people is 
incapable ol having a perfect Christmas, 
yet we still try. 

So, what now? If we are, indeed, 
incapable of recapturing Ihe same feel- 
ings of holiday magic and perfection. 



what then, besides Ihe children, makes 
Christmas important and worthwhile for 
adults? 

The holiday season is important for 
a completely different reason when we 
reach adulthood. 11 is essential because it 
reminds us of our childhood wonder and 

For a short while, everyone is a litllc 
nicer. Everyone seems to try a little hard- 
er. We forget about our prejudices and 
problems lor a week or so. We enler the 
new year still a little warm and fuzzy 
from Christmas. 

So, as we stand with our past laid 
out behind us and the new year waiting 
lilte a promise of hope and opporturuty, 
we strive to be betler people. We make 
resolutions Ihal seem fully attainable 
afler surviving yel another Christmas 

This is what makes Ihe holidays 
worthwhile for adults. Striving to recre- 
ate the perfect Christmas of childhood 
lends us lo self- improvement, perhaps 
this year more Ihan ever. With the events 
of Sept. 11, we are more aware of how 
much our family and friends mean to us. 

Although we cannot undo the 
hatred and ignorance of others, we can 
change our outlooks and strive to be 
more caring and accepting people. 

This is what the holiaay season is 
truly about in America. Forget about the 
religious, cultural and personal differ- 
ences that, ifdwclled upon, serve only lo 
separate us from one another. Remeiiiber 



theac 






icthal 



used to be what Christm: 

Happy New Year everyone! At a 
time when peace is but a glimmer in our 
minds, let us make peace with one 
another and enter Ihis new year with all 
the wide-eyed excitement and wonder of 
a young child.

The advertisemeni world has gone under a drastic remodeling in the

Women especially are supposed to outivardly express their desire to 
lose weight, whether they want lo or not. 

The average person only gains around two pounds over the holiday 
season. This is not a drastic weight gain, and for the mosi pari, not one that 
would neccssilate a drastic weight loss program. 

For those who arc in need of a liltic Irimming, start oi Ihe new year 
seems like the perfect time lo do it. 

For the most part, resolutions are probably positive things. They give 
people a sei\se of optimism, that anything is possible in Ihe new year. 
Generally, people are excited about their fresh commitments. 

Unfortunately, there is that inevitable element of failure that seems to

and lalhcr who came to the 
mutual decision with his wile 
Elhcline, played by Angelica

more. Take note thai Royal and 
Elheline were nol divorced; they 
jusi didn't live in the same house 
logclher lor roughly 20 years. 

Dclore the separation, the 
Tenenbaum parents had three 
children, all of whom were child 
prodigies.

dysfunclional. 

Royal remained a lop dog

when he was disbarred and 
spent lime m prison, mainly 
because his son Chas sued him

VVilson plays the pari ol Ihc

somewhat confusing, t suppose 
one could theorize thai Ihe part 
where he shaves off his hair and

new person and deciding on 
changing his life for the better. 
Then again, that theory is mon: 
than likely cancelled out when 
he .'ibshes his wrists immediate- 
ly alter shaving. Go figure. 

Hackman played the rebel- 
lious curmudgeon with the 
determination to right his 
wrongs and rebuild Ihe bridges 
he burned while separating him- 
self from his family. He has more 



Ihan proven his range as a per- 
former and has become a per- 
sonal bet officv favorite. 

All in all, Anderson and 
Owen IVilson (who plays an 
envious next door neishbot and 
cowbo\- enthusiajl who eniow 
the oc^rasional 'nose candy"!, 
wrote a script that is complex in 
struclutv and filled with charac- 
ters designed lo be rather 
Ealhelic beings. The movie is 
roken doivn into chapters and 
with each chapter comes either a 

reason lo pily the Tencnbaums. 

In the end. Royal helps 
clean up the mess bniuehl on by 
Ihe long separation from his 
wile. He is able lo make peace 
with himself by causing peace lo 
exist kvhere it had never before 

The Royal Tenenbaums* is 
humorous, not hilarious. It is 
dcprcssirig. but nol suicidally 
glum, "niis film is the 
Tenenbaum tale of making good 
endings out of b.id beginnings. 
A definite must-sec for Ihose 
looking to derive a little humor 
from the nuclear family concept. 



'Across the Broad Atlantic' a live success for MacGowan 



By )annh Crismore, Features Editor 

History was made in March 2001 when Irish 
singer and pocl Shane MacGowan, with his band 
Ihc Popes, became the first entertainers lo perform 
In Dublin and New York City on Saint Patrick's 
Day. This came about after an outbreak of fool- 
and-moulh disease in Dublin forced Saint Patrick's 
Day celebrations to be moved lo be postponed 
until May. 

The event was documented, in all drunken 
glory, on "Across the Droad Atlantic." a live CD 
released by MacGowcn and Ihe Popes, Arranged 
from songs by the Popes and MacGowan's former 
band. Ihe Pogues, this recording delivers to the lis- 
tener Ihe essence of seeing MacGowan live with all 
of the forgotten lyrics, cursing and praises lo 
Ireland included. 

Beginning with the Pogues' "If I Should Fall 
From Grace wilh God," MacGowan belts out the 
lyrics about his love of Ireland and the direction in 
which he believes Irish politics should move. This 
track has become his signature opening song and 
with this recording Iho reasons for Ihe song's pop- 
ularity can be heard clearly. Wn\\ its catchy refrain 
~Tid musical riffs, the tune makes Ihe listener want 



Ihe SI 



ogoi 






Foilowing Ihc opening song is "Rock and Roll 
Paddy." a song about MacGowan's admiration of 
, followed by "Nancy Whiskey," a song 



' 1 1 tut going on stage drunk and sometimes 

II making It to the shows, but Ihese two 

.,uu(;&gt; jbuul rocK 'n' roll and alcohol, delivered 
wjlh raunchy precision, make Ihe listener under- 
stand the Iwo worlds from which MacCowarf 
obtains his inspiration. 

The concert slows doivn from bouncy drink- 
ing songs to the sentimental "A Rainy Night in 
Soho." perhaps one ol Ihe best Pogues songs con- 
verted by Ihe Popes on the whole album. 
MacGowan sounds sad. almost embillered when 
singing this one. The (vords are beautiful and he 
efforllesslv describes the beauty of a woman he 
loves, perhaps from long ago. but it almost sounds 
as if he is struggling to sing the personal ballad By 
the end of the song when MacGowan proclaims. 
"You an' Ihe measun? of my dreams," the crowd 
L-\plode.s wilh appl.iuse. making i

thing will be just fine, 

MacGowan sines about Ihe life of an Irish rail- 
road worker on 'Poor Paddv Works on Ihe 
Railway" before the theme swilches lo finding the 
love of nis life along a river in The Broad Majestic 
Snaimon." Each song proves that MacGowan is a 
master of writing the story poem and selling it to 

Another exciting aspect about this album is 
way in which the Popes play the Pogues' songs. 
MacGowan is there lo lead Ihem with his raspy 
voice, but the Popes do play the songs differently 
than the Pogues did. There is a more organic feel lo 
Ihe Popes' music. The band does not break down 
when MacGowan stumbles over a word, or in 
some cases forgets an entire verse, like how Ihc 
Pogues used to break doivn. The Popes i 



The Popes' ability to find their place with 
MacGowan is heard on Ihc song "More Pricks than 
Kicks" where MacGowan goes over Ihe ending 
chorus several times, as the six-member Popes slop 
playing, only to pick up a I Ihe beginning of the 
chorus again. It sounds as if MacGowan docs not 
want to lei Ihe song end and the Popes manage lo 
slay with him until he is ready to finish. 

Pogues fans will be pleased lo know Ihal the 
Popes do wonderful rendilions of favorites such as 
"Body of an American" and "A Pair of Brown 
Eyes." Addilionally. Popes fans will be elated lo 
hear how excellent "Mollier Mo Chroi" and 
"Lonesome Highway" sound live. However 
of the best songs on the album is "Slrear 
Whiskey," a song thai MacGowan describes 
dream where he has a drink ivilh Irish prii 
and poet Brendan Bchan. The energy never d 
this fast and slurred numticr. making it even 
evident thai MacGowan ptaclices what he preach-! 
es— lo go through life wilh a full boltle in one hnnd| 
and an empty one m Ihe other. , 

The album ends with an encore pcrformanci 
of Ihe Pogues' seasonal hil "A Fairytale of Nc&gt;^ 
York." MacGowan's mother. Theresa, did the 
honor of singing Ihe depressing duet about realiz- 
ing a wasted life in a dnink tank on Christmas Eve 

MacGowan sings lo the Irish, the English and 
to the American. He sings lo the Catholic and Ic 
the Protestant. He sings lo Ihe drunk and lo the 
sober Whether ihe listener is a pwl or a priie-

season opener

After coming off a disappointing season 
last year, ihe IPFW men's volleyball team 
hoped to pull off a season opening upset over 
'" ' ' ' - " ■—--■. 'iial a 



Student ticket distribution schedule for Jan. 19 and Jan. 
28 basketball doubleheader games 

For the Jan 19 games at Gates' Students get in by showing their IDs only. However, there will 
be a paper ticket tor students at the ACS student information desks on the first floor of Kcttler on Jan. 
14, 15 and 16, These paper tickets will allow the students lo write their names on the back side of the 
tickets and therefore become eligible for the "Free Tuition Shots" lobe conducted at the Jan. 19 games! 
At halftime of the women's game, one student will have a chance lo win a semester of free tuition at 
IPFW!! These paper tickets will also be available at Gates until the time of Ihe games on Jan.l9. 

For the Jan, 28 games at the Coliseum, student ticket distribution will beat the following areas: 
—Ground level ol Kcttler next to Subway from 10:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. on Jan, 22, 23, 24 and 25 
—Information Desk in Kelller Hall 
— Information Desk in Walb Union

pull It off. After being down 19-13 in game i 
IPFW stormed back with improved selling and 
hitting to a 30-27 win after a kill by freshman 
Dennis Santiago. 

TTic early going of game two saw both 



IPFW up 24-23 over Ihe 49ers. Junior middle 
hitler Angel Ruiz drove home the winning kill, 
allowing the Dons to take game two 30-24. 

After needing just one more win in a best 
at live games, IPFW failed to mainlain the 
intensity level. Long Beach led the entire game 
with IPFW slaying close with the rally scoring. 
The 49ers took game three, with senior Tim 



May leading Ihe way. 

Again Ihc Dons found themselves trailing 
in game four. A kill by Mitch Drcisbach and a 
block by RuiE tied the game at 15. The large 
crowd support poshed the Dons to a 29-27 lead 
alter a kill by Ruiz. Dreisbach possibly could 
have won the game by allowing a Long Beach 
hit to go out of bounds, but he instead attempt- 
ed the dig. Long Beach was able to block an 
IPFW hit and eventually won game four 32-30. 

In Ihc final game, IPFWs outside hitter 
Matt Zbyszewski, who had had suffered from 
left knee iniuries in the past, went down after 
scoringa kill. The absence ofZbvsircwski on Ihe 
floor allowed lhe4'A'rb U&gt; lal.cwmc five, 1&amp;-14.

"So 1 met them in Auburn 
nnd one thing led to another 
and before I knew il, they were 
asking me to write a book for 
them, I replied, 'nol hardly.'" 

Six months later, Weller 
received another phone call 
from Thompson, 

"He said he had quit the 
Klan and had a lot to say about 
its corrupt nature and if I had 
any interest in Ihe idea, he'd 
like to cooperate in an anti- 
Klan venture."

nine months working on a

In the fall of 1998, Wcller's 
book, "Under the Hood," was 
published. 

"It has been a good seller 
since then," he said. "It sells 



and slill ship books iveeklv. Of 
course, that's not enougn to 
make a living on!'' 

"Under Ihc Hood," to 
Wcller's surprise, was written 
and published at a time wher&gt; 
"there was not much in the 
way of new or recent books on 
the Klan," he said. "I hit the 
market at a good lime." 

Other than its "OZ" appear- 
ance, the book has also been 
featured on "several Discovery 
and History Channel shows 
about cult groups and Ihe 
like," according to Weller, 



Weller said "Under the 
Hood" "was meant to be an 
anIi-Klan book, but 1 have a 
hunch plenty of Klan types are 
buying it. It has a Ion of my 
photographs in it. The Klan 
likes the book because Ihoy 
thrive on publicity and I do 
have a little bit of guilt about 
that. 

"However, I do feci it is an 
eye-opener because it reveals 
the bankrupt nature of their 
beliefs, as well as sheds some 
light on Ihe real causes of 
racism — fear and ignorance to 

extent, a thirst for power and 
Tccognilion. Klan leaders 
know what they are doing. 
Their followers are sheep, but 
the leadership is quite crafty."
