They have been taught, implicilly 
nnd evplicilly, ihal theirs is an 
inferior race and ihcy have believed 
il lo Ihe point of denying iheir heri- 
tage if possible.. Slowly ihcy are 
awakening lo the richness of their 
inherited culture and to the fact 
thnt their people have contributed 
very much lo this way of life called 
\merican. The younger Mexican- 
Americans are leading a movement 
lo awaken their Chicano brothers and 
sisters to their cause, and to. en- 
lighten their Anglo brothers nnd 
sisters as lu their presence and 
idenlily. \nd we're even in F'orl

h. Fori ffayne. the United 
MevTcan-\merienns (UM-M. Inc., 
have been in existence sfnce igfil. 
It is an organization whose purpose 
ts lo work within the system to open 
the doors of opportunity for Mcxican- 
\mcricans and olher Spanish speak- 



ing citizens of the community, and 
to provide the means by which each 
person can further his education. 
Toward this end, UM\ has joined 
with Ihe Spanish Club at W-PU 
Regional to implement an innovative 
outreach program. Working closely 
with Dr. Ulmerof lU, and .sith Maria 
Male. President of the Spanish Club, 
the Officers of UMA are planning a 
program of incrcascd-education 
opportunity-awareness for the Spanish 
Seniors of Fori Kayne high schools. 
By this means, we hope to inform 
each student of his right and respon- 
sibility lo develop Sis potential lo 
their fullest: we also hope to enable 
him -to find Ihe means by which lo 
continue his educalioo. It is a mar- 
velous means of making u Spanish 
club really mcaaingful to its mem- 
bers, [t is a marvelous way of making 
ihe -Vmerican Dream" a reality for 
Mexican-Americans. It &gt;s a marvelous 
way of making America an America 
for e.eryooc. 

Well, so much for what one por- 
tion of the Tcacb-ln was about and 
for what one Campus acltvily is about.

HEY! Pay Attention!! 

Storting Monday, April S, 1971, a portion of the driveway at the froat 
of the Education Building will be closed. The street area closed will 
extend from the flag pole, weU to the comer. This closure is necessitated 
because of the building modification required to convert to a new healing- 
cooling system for the total campus. This roadway will remain closed for 
approximately 90 days. 

During the period of closure, city bus service (loading and unloading) 
will be accomplished oo the west drive at the comer nearest the south- 
west corner of the cafeteria-libra^ wing of the Education Building. Per- 
eons using city bus service are encouraged to use the south entrance of 
the cafeteria-library wing to gain easy access to city bus service or the 
building. After loading or unloading, the bus wilt do a Y-lum around at 
the Power Plant and back track the west drive in exiting our campus. On 
the way out, the bus will pick up any late arrivals at the bus stop area. 

In order to alleviate traffic congestion with the front street area 
closed, all passenger loading and unloading p( private aulos will be en- 
couraged to take place at the east end of the east wing of the Educatioa 
Building adjacent to the west area of the "A" parking area. 

All parking meters in the area west of the flag pole will be unavail- 
able for use during the coastructioa period. The parking meters to the 
south of the flag pole will be available (or ose during the coostruclion 
period; however, access to and depiirture from this area will have to be 
from the south driveway.

Reiff^ Team C, Wins 
Intramural Championship 



Basketball 
championship game ivas held on 
Thursdiij, April I, before a sparse 
crowd at Jefferson Junior High 
Sehool. The match-up was between 
Team C (llcitfl, undefeated in tour- 
nament play, ond Baker's Team J, 
who had lost only once in tourney 
action. Team j won the first game 
76-6B, bul Team C came back in the 
second and final gome 88-75 lo win 
It and the championship. 

In Game I , Baker's Team got 
off to a quick start behind the 
shooting of Gene Devbrow and Dan 
Rvan. Between Team J's slieky 
man-to-man defense and Relffs 
ice cold ahooling. Team C came up 
on the short end of a 44-27 half- 
time deficit, fleitfs team came out 
in the second half tvith a man-to- 
man, und along with the shooting 
of Charlie Berg, they began chop- 
ping away at Baker's lead. But 
llyan and Devbrow proved to he just 
too much of a power on the hoards 
and the closet C could gel was 
within [our points with about a min- 
ute and a half .remaining in the 
game. Team J was led by Devbrow 
and Ryan with 26 and 22 points re- 
spectively while Motler hit 21 and 
Berg canned 16 for the losers. 

Came 2 saw just the opposite 
of the first game. This time Team 
C buih a ijuick 7-0 lead before Opv- 
brow could put Baker's team on the 
scoreboard, \gain, it was under- 
neath the boards where the lead was 
built as Rciffs Team often got a 
third or fourth shot at the bucket, 
while Team J had to settle for one 
shot man&gt; limes. Charlie Berg ivas,~ 



ain, the big differe 
early stages of the game, hut he 
ran into foul trouble and Rciff had 
lo rely on their balanced scoriag 
attack to build a 41-26 half-time 
lead. Devbrow was held to 8 points 
the first half by the itcfcnse-minded 
playing of lloff. 

n the second half Baker's 
team allcmpted to stage a comeback 
and actually outscored Team C, but 
Rciffs lead proved to he too much

for all he's worth. When the Conquistodors come, 
tbey hod Bibles and ihe Meiicons had gold. When 
they left, they hod gold and the Mexicans hod Bibles. 
Guodolupe Midotgo made Meiicons a charier U.S. mi- 
nority group. Properly fights ond even the right of life 
was token owoy. The law structure upheld this oppres- 
sion. For example, the Texos Rangers could kill any 
Mexicon-Americon on suspicion olone. Today the Chicono 
is still oppressed. As o migrant form worker, he is literolly 
controlled by the lorge cofporolions. Pushed into the ghetto, 
he is exploited by slumlords. The Brown movement is grow- 
ing, though, with ihe UMA, Lettuce Boycott Committee, Form 
Lobor Aid Committee, ond Migront Council. They're a long 
woy from being finished, however. Recently on Indiana formei 
was token to court on charges of using child lobor, substan- 
dard, unsanitary condilions, and low wages. He was found 
guilly on all counls-ond given o warning. The Brown Berels 
are out to chonge this type of injustice. BOB CAIOLA . ON
