Sociology Department 
explores abuse and 
disabled women 



By Elaine Bakle 



Diane Taub, professor and chair, 
and Donna Holland, assistant 
professor of IPFW's sociology 
department, with the support of 
graduate research assistants, Hei- 
di Wheeler and Elaine Bakle, are 
studying partner violence against 
women with physical disabilities. 

One goal of the research project 

with physical disabilities experi- 
ence different kinds of abuse since 
they have a greater possibility of 
dependence on intimate partners 
than do able-bodied women. 
Findings show that this particu-

they often think i h ■..■ &gt; 
deserve the abuse or they do not 
want to upset their abusers for 
fear of retaliation. 

Disabled women also may not 
have extensive social support net- 
works. In addition, their accom- 
modation needs sometimes cannot 
be addressed at a typical abuse

According to Taub and Hol- 
land, this project is especially 
important; findings will aid in the 
development of effective policy

Baklc says, "It is very difficult to reach 
this population of women. It is hard 
enough ini an ;ihk- IhhIkiI woman to come 
forward to relive their abuse, but some- 
times a woman with a physical disability 
is still in the abusive situation and fears 
her abuser. It takes great courage for them 
to come forward. But without their as- 
sistance, we lack the evidence wc need to 
make changes in the system." 

Bakle adds that this population is ex- 
tremely protected by their therapists and 
caregivers, so it is really up to a woman to 
volunteer.

Shamrocks and snakes and leprechauns, oh my! 



By Stephanie Samples 



Every year on March 17 people 
all over the world celebrate St. Pat- 
rick's Day. For some it is a holiday 
celebrated with pride for their re- 
ligious and ancestral background, 
while some celebrate and use the 
holiday as an excuse for a green beer. 
So why do so many 
celebrate this holi- 
day, and where did it 
all begin? Who was 
Saint Patrick? What 
is the significance of 
the shamrock, and 
what is it that a lepre- 
chaun does exactly? 

Like many holi- 
days there is truth and folklore that 
surrounds St. Patrick's Day. Accord- 
ing toHistory.com, Saint Patrick was 

it during conversion to l hrisiiami\ 
There is debate on what his given 
name was. Saint Patrick 

i wealthy family in England 



his father most likely participated tor 
financial reasons and so as a child 
Saint Patrick had very little involve- 
ment with the church. At 16, his life 
took a drastic change when a group 
of Irish raiders robbed his home and 
kidnapped and enslaved him. Dur- 
ing the next six years of enslave- 
ment Saint Patrick began to discover 
a relationship with God. According 
to legend, he began dunking about 



"At 16, his life took a drastic 
change when a group of Irish 
raiders robbed his home and 
kidnapped and enslaved him." 



dunging the common Pagan laiib of 
the Irish to dial of Christianity. 

After escaping captivity. Saint 
Patrick returned to Britain where he 
but he acquired tnen begm s , u d y ing to become a 
priest. After fifteen years of study, it 
is said that Saint Patrick had a dream 
bom of a,, mg( . ] [elling mm to relum , 
Ireland. Soon after he returned to 
and although his father participated [ re land to begin his missionary work. 



rhrough das work, he began con- 
vening pagans lo Christianity To 
make the transition Irom paganism 
to Christianity easier for the Irish 
people. Sjint Patrick blended old 
Irish traditions with new Christian 
celebrations. He created the Celtic 
Cross by placing the sun, a powerful 
Irish symbol, onto a cross, a pow- 
erful Christian symbol, making the 
cross more natural to the Irish. 

Throughout history there has 
been a connection between Saint Pat- 
nek and snakes. In legend il is said 
that Saint Patrick stood on a hill and 
banished all snakes from Ireland. 
However, the banishing of snakes is 
a metaphor for the removal of pagan- 
ism. Less than 200 years after Saint 
Patrick's arrival Ireland was com- 
pletely Christianized. 

There are many stories that show 
the connection between shamrocks 
and Saint Patrick. Some legends say 
that Saint Patrick used the shamrocks 
in his teachings of Christianity. He 
used die three leaves lo symhohzc the 
three pans of Christian faith. Anoth- 
er story states that the shamrock was 
used as a symbol of Irish pride lhai 
people wore during . i time of change.

The Leprechaun itscll is shrouded 
in legend. The talcs arc said lo have

ies. Leprechauns were the shoemak- 
ers of fairies. They were known for 
being tricky and sneaky when pro- 
tecting then Measure The Americans 
perception of leprechauns changed 
due lo a Disney movie* called "Darin 
O'Gill and the Little People," which 
introduced the cheery image of lep- 
rechauns. 

St. Patrick's Day has been celebrat- 
ed in America since I7f&gt;2 when Irish 
soldiers served in America as part of 
the English military. Since then the 
holiday has been used as a source of 
hope during times ot racism, iorcele-

Movie theater 

etiquette 

examined 

Who's doing it all wrong 

By Nicole Daly 



Been to the movies lately? I 
have. And every time I go. it just so 

happens dial the same people are 
there 1 I know you've seen (or heard) 

Let's get right into it... The first 

one is We Couldn't Find a Babysit- 
ter. They are always at (heaters. 
How late is it? How child-appropri- 
ate is the movie? Doesn't matter! 1 
saw "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" at 
10 p.m. and they were there. Babies, 
toddlers, small children; they're all 
Fair game. These parents want to see 
the movie so badly that they don't 
mind changing the inevitable urine- 
snaked sheets over the next several 
weeks or months. 

Next up. we have the Let's 
See How Annoying We Can Be 
kids. These kids usually have been 
dropped off by their parents but 
could range anywhere from 12- 
17. They laugh unusually loud at 
anything, and back m the days of 
the pre-previews roller-coaster 
ride they rode it-hands up and 
everything. Wondering what they're 
thinking? You don't have to! They'll 
say everything loud enough for 
those in the back row to hear (which 
is lDud, because they always sit in 
the very front). 

Last time 1 saw a movie, I had 
the pleasure of si nine in front of a 
combination of Predictor, Repealer 
and Clapper. Predictors think that 
they are the only people in the room 
smart enough to know that Forrest 
Gump and Jenny will become fast- 
friends They also say "I told you 
so" when Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan

I'm a reader and an observer and

being lectured on the many variables 
lhat control our lives. It was an 
unexpected .idveiiiure I precariously 
placed myself in. 

I remember sitting quietly to 
myself, observing, as many lone 
travelers do. I couldn't help but over- 
hear the conversations, one of which 
specifically caught my attention. A 
couple of guys were discussing the 
uncomfortable emotional imbalances 
of being in love and I couldn't help

As I said, in the spare time of

of human interaction. While I still

on "listen to speak" ratios.

more attention you are naturally were ones with the fewest expecta-

to daydream that people, especially 
girls, had signs over their heads that 
said "interested" or "not interested." 
Obviously, life is not that simple, and 
those signs aren't blatantly posted 
and doors aren't simply open. 

Thanks lo mediums such as Face-

Clappers are apparently under 
the impression that actors in films 
are somewhere in the room along 
with them. They clap during funny,

shouldn't judge, because they ob-

they're sitting close enough to appear 
as if surgically attached.) They make 
me miss the days of crappy movie 
chairs that had the immobile arm- 
rests Maybe they weren't armrests 
as much as body separators.... 

And we've all sat beside Sick 
Guy I say guy, because this person is 
always a man! He's in the worst stag-

shaking and he's very congested. 
However, he hasn't thought to bring

Don't worry though, he won't need

'The Prestige* 
pulls coolness 
out of a hat 

By Mike Webb 

Arts &amp; Entertainment Editor 

If someone approached you with 
a movie idea aboul two rival magi- 
cians in the 1800s, would it sound lo 
you like something worth watching' 
Initially, it sounds horiny and cheesy 
hut I suppose it's all in the presenta-

very well done. Oh yeah, and David 

The fact ihat "The Prestige" was 
directed by Christopher Nolan was 
what caught ni&gt; attention. "Memen- 
to" is a true classic, and "Batman 
Begins" breathed new life into one 
of my favorite characters. The east of 
Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale. Mi- 
chael Came. Scarlett Johansson and 
David Bowie left me with no choice 
but lo watch the movie. 

The movie centers on two up-and- 
coming magicians. Robert Angier 
(Jaekmanl and Alfred Borden (Bale). 
Mentoring mulct a man named Culler 
(Camel, the young men are aspiring 
to have their own magic slum one 
day During a magic performance in 
which the two young magicians are 
assistants, an accident leads to a fatal- 
ity. Due to the nature of this accident, 
it appears that Borden contributed lo

which adds tension and anticipation 
until the climax. 

This approach could be contusing 
if it weren't done in such a masterful 
way. Though the plot jumps around, 
the viewer is not left confused as to 
what is happening. In real life, peo- 
ple have flashbacks, this movie jusl 
shows them all. 

The acting is top-notch through- 
out the film, as is expected with a cast 

If there is one downside to this 
movie, it is a bit slow. There is not 
a lot of action here, so don't expect 
anything last-paced I be emphasis is 
instead on intelligent execution. 

If you like unpredictable movies 
and you can stand slow pacing, check

Scorcese finally gets what's coming to him

(hut the measure of a director's work 
cannot be held to bow many awards 
he or she has won. Alfred Hitchcock 
never won. Orson Welles never won. 
Stanley Kubrick never won. Spike 
Lee has never even been nominated 

That's my obligatory thc-Oscars- 
don't-really-matter-in-lhe-grealer- 
realm-of-the-art-world disclaimer. 

That being said: Martin Scorsese 
finally won!! I was watching with 
my whole family, and we all sat there 
biting our nails as Steven Spielberg 
tore the envelope open to announce 
the 2007 Best Director award. The 
word "Martin" left his lips and we 
were already out of our seals cheer- 
ing like drunken Colts fans at Super- 
bowl XLI. 

Scorsese has been working in 
films for nearly four decades and 
he has earned seven nominations, 
including ones for "Goodfellas." 
"Gangs of New York" and "Rag- 
ing Bull." He was not uomin.tied tor 



"Taxi Driver." "Casino," "Bringing 
Out the Dead" or "Mean Streets." He 
has often been a hit typecast by those 
largely unfamiliar with his work as 
being (he post -"God father" Italian 
Mafia lilm director, but that's not giv- 
ing him enough credit by a lout! shot. 
His films will sustain us long after he- 
has shuffled this mortal coil. 

What makes a great storyteller is 
not what they say, but how they say 
it Martin Scorsese understands peo- 
ple—not unlike the way Shakespeare

In 1997, while driving down the road think-

on the radio anymore, I stumbled upon a song 
called "Black" by u new band known as Seven- 
dust. I immediately drove In a store and bought 
the CD. For me. Sevendust was a band that was 
so fresh and needed al Ihc lime. They single- 
handedly reminded me of whal I love aboul 
music- -passion. 

Consisting of Lajon Witherspoon (vocals), 
John Connolly (guitar, vocals), Clint Lowery

The Dons have enjoyed lots of 
support at home this season, often 
packing the stands at Gates, and the 
matches against Ihe Gauchos were no 
exception, drawing over 1200 fans 
for both games. Despite all the sup- 
port a learn could want in stands, the 
Dons faced an unphased competitor 
lhat won three games straight 30-21,
