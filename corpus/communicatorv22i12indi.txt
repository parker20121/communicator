Students' Government 

Constitution could 
provide purpose 



That &lt;|ii&lt;'s1inii probably came across the minds ol the majority 
of I ho student senate in the pas! I wo works while they debated 
I he impeachment ol Mark Snyder. 

It is clear Dial I ho student sonalo is not a company 
men for the executive branch. II is also equally clear 
of the students senators are not on DPFWs student senate only 
because membership iooks good on their resumes. What is not 
clear is why they are (here. Docs student senate or Students' 
Government have a clearly slated purpose in mind? 

No organization willingly atlempts to V 
unless il has one: Be il its' intent for profit or 
change society tor Hie heller What an organi/ati&lt; 
achieve by its actions defines it purpose for exi 




Each Students' Covcniinonl moniln'i .1 Id look carefully at 

the preface in the current constitution and try to find purpose 
there. If the answer cannnl be found in the current constitution, 
then the role of Students' Covernment should be 
and its purpose juslihcd to the student body. 

One way Students' ( ioyernmeiil can do this is throu 
constitution. Not the 90-91 constitution, which would

If the current constitution cannot define the Students' Gov-

should.
