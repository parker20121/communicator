Psych class necessary evil 

The Students' Government made a good point in being critical of holding classes 
in the Student Union. But it failed to take the most important issue into account: 
[his university is primarily for academic activily and that must be taken care of 
first. 

It is selfish to demand that classes not be held in the Union when a real need 
exists. The (ail is, this campus is hurting for lecture room space. The campus is 
growing and things will get worse before they get better.

Holding classes in the Union is not a step toward less recreation on campus, since 
recreation is a rare animal at IPFW anyway. Bui it is necessary that everyone 
here deal with matters in terms of their importance. And it is mosl important to 
have room for the people who need to take classes.
