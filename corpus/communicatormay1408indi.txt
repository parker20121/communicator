Intramural success brings more student interest 



By DAN VANCE 

dan v jnceef ra n chiitp u bl ica lionvnt I 

Growing each year, rhe IPFW 
Intramural program has ended its 
most successful season yet. 1,474 
players made up the 2007-2008 
intramural season in 16 different 
activities. 

That number is up 241 from the 
previous year's total, something 
that pleases Ron Clark, who now 
has six years under his belt running 
the program. 

The program pulled interest 
from students in several different 
ways this past year, including fliers 
and heavy promoting during the 
summer's SOAR sessions. Clark 
also says that the website (ipfw. 
edu/intramurals) will be worked 
on over this summer to include 
more information and interactive 
ability for interested students. 

At SOAR, there is a pre- 
registration allowing students to 



check anything they are interested 
in, allowing their names to be in 
the intramural database to receive 
informational e-mails. 

The sport attracting the most 
attention was basketball. While 
only 41 women participated, the 
men's division was full with 30 
teams and 473 participants. 

"It's always basketball," Clark 
said about the most popular 
activity. "Usually it hovers around 
24 teams, it was completely 
packed. There was no room to 
expand unless we can get more 
gym lime." 

This year, a Body Blast Fitness 
program was added for Tuesdays 
and Thursdays. The class was 
offered free for the first 22 students 
who showed up either day. 

"Students have been pretty 
positive. They get something 
consistent, are always getting 
updates on what is going on," 
Clark said. "We just try to work 



s going on 



with the kids on what i 
and what they are into." 

In total, the program offers two 
basketball leagues, dodgeball, two 
Body Blast classes, volleyball, flag 
football, racquetball, ping pong, 
golf, walleyball, sand volleyball, 
soccer, team tennis, ultimate 
frisbee and participation in the 5K 
Mastodon Stomp event. 

The possible changes for 
next year include moving some 
events from multi-weeks to one 
or two days and adding a 3-on-3 
basketball tournament to utilize 
the courts at the Waterfield 
Campus Housing site. 

Clark also says including Ivy 
tech students may be possible. 

"I think that they (Ivy Tech) 
underestimate how many students 
will take advantage of it," Clark 
noted. "I think that building that 
relationship with them and adding 
more IPFW students will really 
increase the demand."

Top 10 Tips for New Students 

10. Your tuition does not get you a free masseuse, no matter 
what that guy in the library says. 

9. You don't have to be a science major to experiment in 
college. 

8. iryou have to leave a lecture to use the restroom, it's 
considered polite to tell your prof how long you'll be gone 

^and what you'll be doing. 
7. Theater majors, be sure to audition for Joseph and 
die Monochrome Trousers. What could be more fun 
than a three-hour musical about Dockers? 

6. Your tuition pays your professors' salaries, so you're 
basically their boss. Make sure to remind them of this. 

5. Art majors, remember that artists never sell paint- 
ings until after they're dead. Of course, if you're really 
impatient, you can start selling paintings this 
weekend... 

4. Only take classes from professors who are listed in the 
phonebook. That way, when you get back your grades, you 
know where they live. 

3. If you're running late for class, you can save time by 
doing several things at once. While you're taking your 
shower, you can also shave, brush your teeth, and blow- 
dry your hair. 

I 



2. If you're really running late, it's OK to come to class in 
your pajamas. However, you might want to rethink the 
onesie. 



1. 1 ullege is a great time to expose yourself to new cultures. 
First, get a trench coat...

JW: Josh asked me to join and I did. It was nice to be with people who were I 
like me and we just had a lot of fun." 

MZ: So. what made you want to become president this upcoming year? 

JW: Well, it's my last year and I wanted to do a little more and contribute! 
more to the league. 

MZ: Do you have any other comments for perspective league members? 

JW: We're fun. We're not stuck up or anything. We like to help people and I 
have a good time in college. 

As the evening continued and guests arrived, everyone found them- 
selves enjoying the event. Conversations ranged from why art was impor- 1 
tant to civilization to how a piece was made to how art can be used to bring I 
a cause to people's attention. I found myself in one of these discussions I 
with league member, Lauren Perigo. 

Perigo and the students in her advanced printmaking class decided to I 
do a project for the late Lola Martinez's family. Lauren knew l^ola and was I 
inspired to do something for her family when she died. Each of the students I 
in the class made an eight-by- eight inch wood block picture to be printed I 
onto paper and sewn together. In the middle square, the students printed I 




the poem "Remember Me" by Christina Rossetti. The students chose this poem be- 
cause it expressed their feelings about Lola. "We wanted to showher family love and 
to do something for them." said Pcrigo. Some of the inspiration for the project even 
came from Lola through her sketches. Many of the students created their pictures 
based on the sketches she left behind. The project showed how art can be used to 
bring attention to a cause or to something that needs to be discussed or remem- 
bered. 

The show ended on a high note. Perigo said. "I'm proud of how well put together 
it was. It looked classy for a bunch of students throwing it together at the end of the 
year with finals going on. It was a good representation of the artwork of the students 
of IPFW." The art ranged from lithographs and paintings, to prints and drawings 
with various styles and images, but it was clear that the Student Art League is a tal- 
ented group of individuals who have a lot to offer on the campus.

So, you're moving out... 

Here are a few points of interest to consider 
when moving out for the first time 



By LOUISA DANIELSON 

Danila02Olpfw.edu 



Going (o college is a 
major step in anyone's 
life. But one of the big- 
gest changes to be faced, 
sometimes, is moving 
away from home. 

How can stu- 
dents best handle the big 
change? First of all, be 
prepared. Although the 
student housing apart- 
ments come fully fur- 
nished Istove, microwave, 
refrigerator/ freezer, sofa, 
chairs, table, bed, dress- 
er, desk, internet access 
and cable, etc.) students 
need to bring their own 
sheets (full extra long or 
queen size), television 
sets, toasters, and all the 
other small things that 
make a place homey. 

Rubbermaid tubs fit 
in the closets and stu- 
dents are allowed to put 
anything on the walls 
that can be held up with 
a thumbtack. Heavier 
items that need nails or 
screws need to be pro- 
cessed through the Cole 
Commons staff with a 
work order - they will 
put in heavier hangers 
as requested. Staff will 
also replace light bulbs, 
fix the equipment in the 



room (like the ice maker 
in the refrigerator) and 
will come when there is 
an emergency (phone 
number 481-4180). 

Students can also pre- 
pare for good dorm life 
by getting to know their 
neighbors. "Learn about 
your suitemates - about 
your hallway," encour- 
ages George McClellan, 
Vice Chancellor for Stu- 
dent 



Security on campus is 
atso important. Each res- 
ident is issued a gray key 
fob that acts like a card 
key to allow access into 
their apartment and the 
student computer labs. 
Students are also issued 
individual metal keys for 
their separate bedrooms, 
for extra security. Resi- 
dent Assistants patrol ev-

a successful transition 
should include reaching 
out to other students,

are and what their needs

more responsible than 
you," McClellan pointed 



women or men - so guys 
will only have guys for 
roommates, and women 
will only have women for 
roommates. 

1PFW also limits the 
number of students per 
resident assistant to a 
ratio of 40:1. "[Ours is] 
better than average," 
noted Walt Branson, Vice 



Chancellor of Financial 
Affairs, stating that other 
schools usually have sixty 
students or more under 
one resident aid's care. 

Students are given in- 
dividual, locked mail box 
es in the Cole Commons 
building and they can 
purchase debit cards to 
use on the washers and 
dryers, which are located 
on every first and third 
floor of each dorm build- 
ing. 

Before new students 
move in, the staff make 
sure the apartment is 
clean.' "We definitely 
make sure it looks brand 
new when you move in," 
said Laura Williams, who 
has worked as a resident 
assistant at IPFW for 
three years. 

Finally, there are 
community programs 
each month hosted by 
resident assistants. Ev- 
erything from canned 
food drives, movie nights, 
EPFW Campus Survivor, 
start of the year cook- 
outs, and Super Bowl 
parties help students mix 
and get to know their 
neighbors. 

As McClellan put it, "I 
just think that you came 
to college to get the most 
out of it that you can." 
with all that available, 
you can. 




Ft. Wayne 

says farewell to 

maestro 



By LOUISA DANIELSON 

Danila02eipfw.edu 



On May 10 at the Em- 
bassy Theatre the Fort 
Wayne Philharmonic 
gave its final perfor- 
mance with Conductor 
Edvard Tchivzhel, per- 
forming Mahler's Resur- 
rection Symphony. This 
monolithic work, which 
look a full ninety minutes 
was performed without 
intermission. 

Of special note 
to this performance was 
the size of the orchestra. 
In addition to the regular 
variety of instruments, 
this performance in- 
cluded ten French horns, 
two piccolos, three clari- 
nets, four trombones, 
two full sets of timpani, 
two choirs and organ. 
A number of musicians 
were placed outside the 
concert hall, both in the 
wings offstage and in the 
grand hallway outside, so 
as to add an 'otherworld- 
ly' effect. 

Before a packed audi- 
ence, the performance 
began as Concertmaster 
Hiromi (to gave a short 
speech. He described 
to the audience an au- 
tographed photo of the 
orchestra that had been 
presented to Tchivzhel 
that morning at the dress 
rehearsal, then finished 
by saying "We appreci- 
ate his passionate music 
making over the past fif- 
teen years, and send our 
best wishes with Maestro 
Tchivzhel." 

Once Tchivzhel 

walkedonstage, applause 
thundered through the 
auditorium. Tchivzhel 
bowed many times, then 
turned to the orchestra. 

The symphony began 
with tremolo shivering 
through the string sec- 
tions. Muted homs add- 
ed a mysterious timbre to 
the mix, topping snarling 
cellos and basses. 

Throughout the piece, 
many moods wove them- 
selves into the fabric of 
the symphony: tiptoeing 
bass and cello sounds 
combined with the harp 
only to be interrupted by 
blasting percussion and 
a tremendous musical 
spiral that sounded like 
something from the Sor- 



cerer's Apprentice. In the 
second movement, die 
mood was cheery, like a 
quick Austrian dance. 

A fugue meandered 
through the strings, only 
to be cut off by puls- 
ing harps. For the third 
movement, the timpani 
jolted the- movement to 
life, ceding reluctantly 
to the winding melody 
of the strings and wood- 
winds. The brass blew 
energy into the move- 
ment with a repetitive 
fanfare. 

At times, the 
vibes from the percus- 
sionists seemed to rat- 
tle the arm rests on the 
chairs in the auditorium. 
A ghostly theme came 
from the musicians out- 
side the concert hall; it 
was terrifically effective 
in giving the sensation 
of a call from the here- 
after. As thi? piece pow- 
ered towards lis close, 
the drummers were lit- 
erally pounding for all 
they were worth, over the 
concentrated power of 
the orchestra. 

Only during the final 
parts of the piece did the 
choir sing, sometimes 
accompanying the solo- 
ists. Their sound was a 
mellowing touch to the 
sometimes harsh reso- 
nanceofthe instruments. 
Members of the audi- 
ence leaned forward in 
anticipation during the 
final movement as the 
organ warmed up. The 
symphony finished with 
blasting tremolo strings, 
a blossoming chord in 
the brass, chimes, and 
rumbling organ. 

An instant stand- 
ing ovation and cheers 
met the end of the work. 
Tchivzhel bowed, then 
acknowledged the or- 
chestra, the soloists, and 
the choir directors. The 
lady soloists were ush- 
ered several times on- 
stage, with tremendous 
bouquets. 

Tchivzhel was given a 
bouquet, from which he 
proceeded to distribute 
red roses to his principle 
siring players. Perhaps it 
was a fitting theme, this 
Resurrection Symphony, 
for a conductor whose 
era has closed here in 
Fort Wayne but will be- 
gin again in Greenville, 
South Carolina.

A message from your 
student body president 

'l^^^^^F- H cimniis ~.iii It ,i- riir.i finite understand ih. 





IPFW Student Body 
President KodyTlnnel 

It is only summer 
but already the Indiana 
Purdue Student Govern- 
ment Association, or IP- 
SGA, is busy preparing 
for the coming year. The 
newly elected executive 
officers, myself included, 
are getting settled into 
our positions and pre- 
paring goals and plans 
for the 2008-2009 school 
year here at IPFW. 

For those unfamiliar 
with IPSGA, it is an or- 
ganization comprised of 
four branches each de- 
signed to serve the stu- 
dents and improve life 
on campus. The Student 
Activities Board (SAB) 
plans various events on 



campus such as guest 
speakers, free food give- 
aways, and Spring Fling 
week. TheStudent Senate 
charters student organi- 
zations, allocates money, 
and makes recommen- 
dations to help better the 
college experience for 
the student body. 

The Judicial Court 
makes rulings and deci- 
sions concerning actions 
that come up in student 
government throughout 
the year. Last but not 
least, the Executive Of- 
ficers, who are elected 
each April by the student 
body, help organize and 
oversee all aspects of 
IPSGA. The elected of- 
ficers are the President, 
Vice President of Legis- 
lation, Vice President of 
Programming, and Vice 
President of Finance. 

The IPSGA office is lo- 
cated on the second floor 
of Walb Student Union. 
The members of student 
government can be great 
resources when trying to 
better understand what 
we do, how time com- 
mitments is needed, and 
all of the benefits of be- 
ing involved. 

Many students don't 



quite understand the 
purpose or the benefits 
of IPSGA. The student 
government here at IPFW 
actually plays a very im- 
portant role. We are in 
charge of putting on stu- 
dent life events, funding 
certain student services, 
lobbying the adminis- 
tration to make changes 
that benefit the students, 
and many other activities 
aimed at bettering the 
campus and making the 
IPFW experience the best 
it can be for the students 
In addition to the cam- 
pus-wide benefits there 
are also numerous other 
perks of being a member 
of IPSGA. Student gov- 
ernment can help people 
make connections, learn 
to work with diverse 
groups of people, better 
understand governmen- 
tal structures, and gain 
valuable experience that 
can help with future ca- 
reer goals. 

When getting back 
into the swing of things 
here at IPFW make sure 
to consider joining up 
with IPSGA to help make 
positive changes. 



Want to be successful in college? 
Then Do Something! 



By ANDREW HOOVER 



It has been a long time 
since I was last in these 
hallowed pages, wistfully 
typing my opinion about 
some subject thinking, 
arrogantly, that you care 
about what I have to say. 
Well, after two years, _ 
you had better listen. 
What I am saying is 
important, really it is, 
and it is all about how 
YOU can be successful 
at college and, upon 
graduation, make a — 
ton of money and buy 
your own private island 
in the Caribbean. That is 
correct, I am giving you 
advice: GET INVOLVED! 
I have been kicked 
out of a few of our finer 
institutions of higher 
learning, including our 
"mother school" in West 
Lafayette. Yet, here, I 
have thrived and I am 
getting ready to apply to 
Grad School! I went from 
a 0.5 GPA to a 2.7 GPA, 
and that is something I 
am damn proud of. But, 
you ask, how did 1 do it? 
Well, I got involved! DO 
SOMETHING! And work. 



class, sleep, work, sleep, 
class, et al is not some- 
thing...that is just surviv- 
ing. 

I could cite all kinds 
of sources and studies 
that show how, beyond a 
doubt, students who get 
involved with on-cam- 
pus clubs and activities 
do better, just flat-out do 

If I can write for The 

Communicator... you 

can too! And they 

actually pay money! 



better, but why bore you? 
Instead, let me tell you 
this; we have some frea- 
Idn' awesome clubs (and 
some dumb ones too}! 
Are you some crazy spin- 
ster surrounded by cats? 
Well, come out and join 
the Stitchery! They have 
some awesome sales and 
some really great people. 
Do you love God and Je- 
sus? Well you are in luck 
because we have over 
60 groups devoted to 
Christianity! If you are 
not so hot on Christ, join 
the Pagans! Maybe you 
want a dash of the seri- 
ous...perhaps our many 



professional groups like 
"small group award win- 
ner" Delta Sigma Pi is 
right for you. Hey, 1 can 
even bend your ear and 
tell you how amazingly 
awesome Student Gov- 
ernment is, because we 
actually do something. 
Not only am I a member, 
I am a Vice President to 
=^ boot! We have over 
100 groups and I am 
not going to call them 
all out.-just ask Sara or 
April in Student Life... 
they are cool and can 
hook you up. 
If lean write for The 
Communicator, and even 
be a decorated editor, 
you can too! And they 
actually pay money! 

Get involved and love 
your campus, even if you 
plan on transferring to 
West Lafasuck or Bloom- 
ingsuck or whatever. No 
one bothered to tell me 
this, at least, not honest- 
ly. They always had some 
4.0 student talking about 
how great being involved 
is. I am a massive, ugly, 
2.7 GPA, ex-drinker, geek 
who is saying get in- 
volved and everything 
will be more fun.
