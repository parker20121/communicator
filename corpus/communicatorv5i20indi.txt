conclusion of Roger Manges, dean 
and director for Purdue here. 

Building D is a proposed academ- 
ic building similar to Neff Hall. It will 
house nursing, communication, fine 
arts, foreign languages, and the 
Division of General and Technical 
Studies (DGTS). 

Manges' statement puts to rest 
local rumors that the fee increase was 
adopted to provide the financing for 
the new building. 

"The one dollar fee increase will 
make us financially more sound," 
said Manges. He added that the new 
revenue could not be used to begin 
new construction projects.

Manges said that the 1975 General 
Assembly would be requested 



receive state funds for building," said 
Manges. 

He cited our increasing enroll- 
ment figures, as compared to 
decreasing enrollments at nearly 
every other state institution, as 
justification for this funding. Also, the 
fact that 95 per cent of the past coast 
has been absorbed by students and 
not by the state would be used as 
justification with the legislature. 

Manges said that many campuses 
around the slate have empty build- 
ings, while IU-PU is crowded for 
space. The Fort Wayne Campus will 
have available 105.9 square feet per 
full-time equivalent student &lt;FTE) by 
the 1976-7 year. The norm used in 
planning is 120 square feet - FTE, and 
that is low according to Manges. 

The FTE figure is obtained by 
dividing the total number of credit 
hours enrolled by 14. II indicates how 
many students a campus would have 
if all students were full-time, 

Building D will cost approximate- 
ly S5 million to build and equip. This 
represents a one million dollar 
increase over the cost of the building 
two years ago. 

The building was originally 
scheduled for completion in 1975, but 
it now cannot be occupied before 1977. 
The large cost increase reflects

Manges is optimistic that the 
legislature will appropriate the mon- 
ey. He indicated that an extensive 
lobby efforl will be made among local 
legislators. 

A Building D committee had 
issued a preliminary report in the 
spring of 1972. This report was to go 



committee member. He attributed 
this deteriorated financial posture to 
an enrollment growth that was 
smaller than expected. 

Marks said that the universities 
did not abandon the project entirely. 
"It was not struck down," he said. "It 
was suspended because of lack of 
financial viability." 

The committee is still "on the 
books," according to Dean Manges, 
and it can be revived or reconstituted 
should Building D get the go-ahead. 

In addition to Marks, the commit- 
tee included Dick Wall, Joe Chandler, 
Doris Mack, Virginia Craig, Ken 
Keller, Mike Rothgeb, Mark Franke, 
Juergen Lichti, and Bill Bruening. 

148 apply for 
super-chancellor 

One hundred forty-eight applica- 
tions for the job of Indiana-Purdue 
super-chancellor have been received 
by the Chancellor Search and Screen 
Committee as of January 17, 1974. 

Six of these applications were 
given consideration by the full 
committee. The committee's official 
notice said that "Considerable time 
was given to the review of these 
applications." 

Sixty-four of the 290 universities 
contacted for recommendations of 
candidates responded, with approxi- 
mately two-thirds of these suggesting 
names to be considered. 

The committee will not meet 
again until Friday, February 1, 1974.

That is how orientation commit- 
tee chairman Donna Brandt analyzes 
the failure of last Friday's new 
student orientation program. Only 
three students showed up out of the 



highly structured program of infor- 
mation dissemination, according to 
Miss Brandt, adding that "what they 
(the freshman) got before was so 
detailed. To counteract that we didn't 
do enough. 

"There has to be a happy 
medium," she said. 

Miss Brandt was the brunt of 
harsh criticism for the program's 
failure from Student Body President 
Brock Able. Able blamed the poor 
turn-out on Miss Brandt's "new and 
innovative ideas." 



Able suggested that &lt; 
should be required of all new 
students. Supporting this mandatory 
attendance proposal was Charles 
Pratt, student senator and a member 
of the o 



Miss Brandt disagrees with 
required attendance. "That's high

there or show your pink slip." 

"If you've got an OK program, 
something that's interesting and 
different, people will come," said 
Miss Brandt. "I still firmly believe 
that we should do something innova- 

The committee attempted to 
provide a meaningful experience for 
the new students by assigning them 
certain tasks. These tasks included 
obtaining permission for enrolling in 
a closed class, finding research 
material in the library, and correct- 
ing an unfair parking ticket. 

"These were very real circum- 
stances," said Miss Brandt. The tasks 
were chosen because they simulated 
situations that students commonly 
find themselves in.

the tasks were developed to make this 
information meaningful. 

Orientation used to be connected 
to advanced registration for fresh- 



involved," said Miss Brandt, who v. 
recently promoted to associate direct- 
or of the counseling and academic 
development division. She said that 
upper-class students would also be 
involved in the orientation program. 

John Ulmer, associate dean for 
student services, said that the 
orientation ideas developed here by 
Miss Brandt and others were present- 
ed at a number of conferences around 
the state. He said that the ideas 
received very favorable response 
from other college administrators 
who also dealt with orientation. 

Miss Brandt suggested that the 
whole concept of orientation should be 
studied by the university. "We have to 
stop and look at the whole thing and 
ask: do we really need it?" she said. 

If orientation is continued, it 
should start when the prospective 
student first contacts the admissions 
office, according to Miss Brandt. 
"Orientation has to start at day one," 
she said. 



Responding to Abie's charges 
that the program was poorly planned, 
she said, "Why didn't Brock say that 
three months ago." She added that 
Able had never voiced his opposition 
to the program to her.

This freezing was in accord with the

The Directed Admissions Pro-

DAP is a program designed to

students adjust to college, according 
to Joseph Haralson, educational 
director of DAP. Many students who 
have weak educational backgrounds 
and would not normally be admitted 
to college are brought into this

commented Haralson. 

"To do this we require each 
student to come in to talk with us at 
least three times each semester. We 
offer tutoring on an individual basis 
and we also work directly through the 



Veterans' Affairs tutoring program." 
Besides personalized counseling, 
the students in the DAP program also 
have the opportunity to take a course 
in Personal Growth and Development 
(GS150). This course is offered in the 
fall. 

Another course being offered by 
DAP is Critical Thinking (GS151), 
designed to help students think 
through any type of situation. This 
course is being offered to all students, 
not just the ones involved in the 
program.

special services, and Haralson, are 
the instructors for the course. They

AAUP recently informed the IU-PU 
Communicator that the collective 
bargaining bill, up for adoption in the 
1974 Indiana state legislature, ex-

Efforts to improve the amend- 
ment to the satisfaction of both 
faculty representatives proved fruit- 
less, Scott said, so they thought it 
better to wait until the 1975 session, 
rather than to be a part of a bad bill. 

"This bill is a bad bill," Dr. Scott 
replied in support of the decision. "We 
may be wrong in not becoming part of 



the last week of Assembly maneu- 
vers, nor has it been signed by the 
governor. In any event we believe the 
composition of the Assembly will be 
different in '75, and a better bill can 
be gained."

at^ Indiana University; Milton Fiske, 
president of AFT at Bloomington; 
Julius Getman and Patrick Baude, 
AAUP law professors at I.U. ; and Bob 
Dunn, an AFT representative, to see 
if they could work out a minimally 
acceptable bill. 

Although there was some dis- 
agreement and difference of opinion 
on specific points, both the AFT and 
the AAUP agreed that they could not 
support this bill (No. 1066) without 



substantial improvements. None

AFT in Fort Wayne, that the bill v 
unconstitutional, Dr Scott said that. 
"No. 1066 is probably not unconstitu- 
tional, although it is discriminatory, 
and it certainly is a poor bill." 

Dr. Scott acknowledged that the 
Bloomington law professors say there 
is no way the faculty could win a case 
on the 14th amendment. There were 
split views in the Indianapolis Law 
School. Both agreed that a case would 
take two to three years of involve- 
ment and $200,000 in costs. 

"Our best bet is through legisla- 
tion," Dr. Scott said. Dr. Gottlieb 
inserted that the legislature was 
using this as a form of punishment for 
the faculty. Dr. Scott contends that 
the legislature is not singling out 
faculty and are not using it as a form 
of punishment.

Dr. Scott indicated that they are 
trying to design legislation that would 
cost the state the least possible 
amount. They are trying to design 
legislation on a corporate model, he 
said, which does not always fit the 
university as it exists, and certainly 
does not fit it as most faculty would 
like it to exist. 

There presently is only a minor 
conflict between the AFT and AAUP 
regarding collective bargaining 
measures, Scott said. One of the 
differences in a decidedly similar 
overall position is that the AFT wants 
a "right to strike" clause. AAUP 
doubts that such legislation could 
pass, according to Scott, and supports 
the "last best offer," compulsory 
arbitration clause of bill No. 1066. 

"The bill would be better without 
the 'no strike' clause, but we can live 
fairly well with 'last best offers' 
arrangements," Scott concluded. 

All faculty organizations in the 
state support collective bargaining, 
according to facts presented in the 
Chronicle of Higher Education. For 
four-year colleges and universities in 
Indiana, the AAUP has 22 supporters, 
the AFT has 12, and the NEA has 15.

Orientation flop 



;tos 



What began as a disquieting trend three o 
jolting climax last Friday when only three new 
orientation program. 

Orientation has been a trouble area for Student Services for a number 
of years Staff members felt that orientation was not doing the job it was 
supposed to. It was felt that the new students were leaving orientation 
without a good understanding of college life in general and IU-PU in 
specific. 

Each semester new ideas were tossed around and some were 
adopted. The key consideration during this period was : how do we better 
"relate" to the new students? 

The emphasis of orientation changed from one of disseminaUng 
information to one of inter-personal relations, and then changed further 
to one of college experience. Each change was made because of 
disappointment with the old and the desire to try something r 

Unfortunately, each orientation f — ■- 
new students. 

It is neither right nor fair to point the finger at one person or even a 
group of people. These new approaches have failed, and more changes 
will have to be made. 

Student Services will have to look hard at orientation. Is an 
orientation necessary at IU-PU? If so, should attendance be mandatory? 

There are no simple answers to these questions. Perhaps the old way 
is the best way after all. Perhaps orientation should concentrate on 
getting out as much information to as many people as possible, however 
unpleasant the means to this end may appear Perhaps this whole idea of 
"relating" is inoperative as an administrative tool. The problem is there 
are just too many perhaps!

Also in the myth category is the

growing trend.

In the United States egalitarian-

which is steadily moving towards

that 



vitnessed what may prove to be 
the ultimate abortion of egalitarian- 
ism in a ludicrous development 
commonly referred to as the counter- 
culture which is egalitarianism gone 

On its surface the counter-culture 
appears to be merely an esthetic 
diaster of the first magnitude but it is 
actually a revealing expression of the 
egalitarian mentality. The forebears 
of the counter-culture realized that 
the achievement of complete equality 
required more than the abolition of 
freedom, it required the eradication 
of all standards and values. 

They knew that as long as there 
were standards and values by which 
people could be judged some indivi- 
duals would come closer to the ideal 
and be rated higher than others. Thus 
to achieve an egalitarian Utopia it was 
necessary to revolt against and reject 
the values of the dominant culture 
(e.g. achievement, ambition, cleanli- 
ness, etc.). The result disproves the 
theories of the idealogues of the Old 
Left who predicted that egalitarian- 
ism would uplift the masses. Instead 
of uplifting the lowest class to the 
level of the highest class the 
counter-culture seems to drag down 
the highest to the level of the lowest. 

The former was found to be 
outside the limits of reality so a 
regression past the mean and towards 
the bottom was adopted. The princi- 
ple is well illustrated by the naval 
maxim that a convoy is only as fast as 
its slowest ship. Thus if all men are to 
be equal they must all descend to a 
level readily attainable by the most 
inferior members of that society. 

The adherents of the counter- 
culture, the hippies, or as I refer to 
them, the "greeners" (after Charles 
Reich's book, "The Greening of 
America") are a bizarre caricature of 
the philosophy which has spawned 
them. They cultivate a physical 
appearance which is at best deliber- 
ately unkept and at worst undeniably 
sub-human. 

They then insist that everyone is 
beautiful and should be loved by 
everyone else regardless of how 
physically revolting he or she may be. 
This last point is very important, for 
when a person can love and find 
beautiful a debased caricature of 
humanity his values and standards 
have clearly been dropped to the 
lowest denominator. 

The rapid proliferation of the 
counter-culture can be attributed to 
several things (eg. the mass media) 
but it is certainly alarming proof of 
the pervasiveness of the conformist 
spirit in this country. Many young 
people, following their habit of 
practicing social metaphysics (i.e. 
the obsessive concern with gaining 
the approval and avoiding the 
disapproval of one's peers) have 
compromised their standards and 
values by succumbing to the influence 
of the counter-culture. If mode of 
dress is a sensitive indicator of 
cultural affiliation, and I believe it is, 
then a great number of today's youth 
seek to identify at least to some extent 
with the counter-culture although 
most are unaware of its origins or 
philosophical premises. 

To those readers who have 
maintained their independence and 
self-esteem and have refused to 
sacrifice their standards and values 
but feel the pull of the conformist 
trend I say that you should recognize 
the counter-culture for the anti-ego 
and hence self-destructive movement 
that it is. Do not sacrifice your values 
to gain the approval of those who have 
sacrified theirs. They are not worth it. 
They future does not belong to them. 
They have no right to it. You do.

Older students 



Once you forget you're a 
learner, you're not alive 



By TOMMY FRANKE 

Most of the students at Indiana- 
Purdue are in the 18 through 
22-year-old age bracket, having 
entered IU-PU immediately after you're not alive, 
graduating from high school. 

However, over one-third of the 
students are over 22 and one-fifth are 
over 25, according to the Commuter 
Campus Study made in the fall of 1972. 



Most of these students have taken 
time out between high school and 
completing college to do things such 
as raising a family, working, or 
serving in the military. 

One person who falls into the 
category of the older student is Ann 

Ann returned to school after 28 
years because she "always wanted to 

"I came from a long line of people 
who finish what they've started. I 
dropped out of college in 1945 for 
practical experience. I was majoring 
in journalism and I went to work on 
the Journal-Gazette." 

Mrs. Oxley added that she was in 
school at I.U. in Bloomington when 
Kinsey was doing his research, when 
Skinner had his baby in a box, and 
when Ernie Pyle was the big hero. 

When asked her reactions to 
being in school with people so much 
her junior, she laughed, "I have kids 
the same age as these college 
students. Learning to get along with 
them is just an extension of what I've 
learned at home." 

When asked her opinion of her 
classmates, Mrs. Oxley stated, "They 
come in all shades from boring to 
extremely interesting. 

"When I first returned to school I 
felt truly stupid and really worked my 
head off. I ne-er touched a 1000 power 
microscope in my life! Of course, I 
felt more competent in other fields 



Jose Lopez is a 27-year-old 
veteran attending IU-PU. He laughed 
when asked his reactions of being an 
older student on campus because, "I 
really don't consider myself an older 
person!" 

Lopez stated that the only 
problem he encounters in being older 
is that he resents being treated "like a 
first or second grader by some 
professors." 

He withdrew from a different, 
stricter college because of that same 
reason. "I still wanted to go to school 
so I went to work, saved money, and 
was then laid off from my job. I came 
to Fort Wayne. I finally got a job here 
on the North Eastern Indiana Migrant 
Council working as a social worker. 

"In this program we had to go to 
school part-time so I started here at 
Indiana-Purdue. Finally I decided to 
go to school full-time. 

"Right now I just don't feel like 
an older student. I have no responsi- 
bilities. I am going to school on the GI 
bill and I work during the summers 
just to save money for school. I even 
have had to compete for dates with 
the other younger students." 

He added, "I like it here." 



older than himself, "These older 
students can even mess up someone in 
their own major. They usually carry 
only three hours so they have all the 
time in the world. 

"They all but memorize the 
assignments and look terribly good 



when they monopolize the discussion 

"I almost think that they should 
identify themselves because it's not 
fair for us full-time students to have to 
compete on the same level. The 
instructor should take this into 
consideration. 

"I guess the best thing would be 
for the professor to take a few 
minutes to become familiar with each 
student. 

"Many of us "younger students" 
are carrying IB or 19 hours in order ' 
graduate and it's just not 






the older students. They give younger 
students a chance to hear different 
attitudes and viewpoints. At the same 



He summarized, "I guess you'd 
have to say that there are many 
pluses and many minuses working 
with older students." 



Barbara Beam, a graduate 
student, took issue with several of 
Briegel's points. "Those who com- 
plain about having to compete with 
older students just need scapegoats. 
If the older students weren't in the 
class, there would be someone else 
smarter that they would complain 

"I think that it is really fun to take 
classes with these older people. I've 
learned many things from them t" 
" ave ordinarily learn- 
isually work very hai 
if the other students need help the 
older ones usually provide it. 

"I think most of the people who 
return to school when they are older 
are fun and interesting. I guess they 



One woman in her early forties, 
who did not want to have her name 
published, talked about some of the 
problems which have arisen over her 
return to school. 

"I have a lot of responsibilities at 
home, such as cooking, cleaning and 
keeping the family happy. I have to 
squeeze in my studies. 

"And, surprisingly, it is some- 
times hard to justify my desire to get 
a degree. People say things like 
good husband 



support you,' and of i 






am lucky that my 
husband and children understand that 
this is something I really need to do 
for my own happiness." 

She explained why she put off her 
education until now. "I married my 
husband in my first year of school. We 
didn't have a lot of money and since 
his education was more important, I 
quit school. Then the family came 

"I never have been quite satisfied 
with myself. There are so many 
things to learn here and I really think 
I've taken a step in the right 
direction." 

She added that she still feels 
rather uncomfortable around her 
younger classmates. "It's not like I 
could see them in the cafeteria and sit 
down and chat. 

"I guess a lot of it is caused by my 
own hang-ups about the age differ- 
ence, but then no one has been 
particularly friendly - that is, except 
for other old students and a few 
isolated cases. 

"It will be a hard pull, but I'm 
determined to see this thing through."

It's relaxing to switch on the T.V. when that paper is

In England they are already finding out how to live 
without telly after ten-thirty. A conscientious soul uses no

"Whether the odds be great or small, old Notre Dame 
will win over all," goes the Irish victory song. Last 
Saturday afternoon Notre Dame achieved in one game what 
88 other teams have tried in the last three years— to beat 
UCLA. 

The year, 1974, could be considered the year of the Irish. 



i the college basketball standings. Although 
UCLA has lost only three games in the last six years, it was 
even longer than that when UCLA wasn't ranked tops in the 



Notre Dame had three of its top players from the D.C. 
area _Austin Carr, Sid Catlett, and Collis Jones. This year 
the Irish are sparked by Gary Brokaw, Dwight Clay, and 
John Shumate from this same area. 

But the biggest recruiting job by the Irish scouts was 
done on Digger Phelps. Phelps was a young coach who todk 
a 11-15 Fordham college team and turned them into a 26-3 
squad before going to the Dome city. When Digger took over 
the troops at N.D., he was taking over the team minus Carr, 
Catlett, Jones, and the rest of the starting lineup. 

The 1972 season ended 6-20 for Digger and his Irish, 
which included a 90-29 thrumping by the Indiana Hoosiers 
as well as two losses to the Bruins. I mean, since Gary 
Novak was the superstar of the team, what could you 
expect? 

Last year, the Irish started out slowly with a 1-6 record 
until they won a 66-64 overtime victory over Kansas. That 
was the turning point of the season, and from there the Irish 
went on to have a great season. They finished second in the 
NIT tournament, losing on a last second shot by a Virginia 
Tech player. 

Yes, when the final buzzer went off last Saturday, it was 
Notre Dame on top 71-70. It was a miracle finish for the Irish 
against Bill Walton and Co. , scoring the last 12 points in the 
contest. Again it was Mr. Clutch, Dwight Gay, scoring the 
winning points in another come-from-behind victory. 

But the real heroes of the game were Shumate and 
Brokaw. Brokaw, who is hittting about 60 per cent of his 
shots this year, started the Notre Dame rally by repeatedly 
scoring from: the outside on long jumpers. He hit 10 of 16 
during the game. 

Shumate started the 12 point sport with a basket and a 
vital steal. He ended up scoring 24 points, but proved to 
Walton that he wasn't intimidated. It must have been a new 
sensation to the big Bruin to see someone challenging him. 

The real key to the outcome was the fact that Keith 
Wilkes was held to only 18 points. In the UCLA win over 
North Carolina State, it was Wilkes' 27 points that led the 
way. In the beginning of the season, when the Bruins beat 
Maryland 66-65, the reason Maryland made a strong 
comeback that almost won it for them was because Wilkes 
had fouled out with over three minutes to play. 

But coming up this Saturday night, the Irish will invade 
the home of the Bruins in part two of the battle for number 
one. It's been a long time since UCLA has lost at home and 
so I'm going with John Wooden and Co. to get its number 
one rating back. UCLA lose again? No chance, says this
