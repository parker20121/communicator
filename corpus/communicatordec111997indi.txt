A look back over the semester's controversy 



Bv Not Becklev 

Editor 



Prologue 

On Scpi 25. The Communicaior 
broke a siory concerning possible 
violabons by \he albleiic depaitmeni 
of NCAA regulaiions concerning 
siudenu. David Fairchild, chair and 
professor of philosophy, resigned 
from his position as NCAA compli- 
ance coordinaior afier the file con- 
cerning the alleged violations ItOTied 
up missing from bis office. 

"When I gel lo the point where 
my files on sensitive matters are not 
secure and I can no longer tnisl the 



people thai 1 work with, I don'i work 
anymore," Fairchild said at the time. 

Fairchild recommended that 
John Williams, mens bead baskel- 
ball coach, be denied a chance to 
recruit players during December and 
during odier normal recruiting time 

Williams said be accepted (he 
sanctions recommended by 
Fairchild and be had already started 
lo comply with the sanctions 

In the mondi since Fairchild 
rcponed lo the NCAA, flyers charg- 
ing the chancellor was keeping 
secret files on people and having an 
"enemies list" began appearing on 
campus. 

Rumblings 

Two days after steppmg down. 



Fairchild started to hear nimors 
about his mental stability and his 
ability to do bis job. 

Fairchild said Chancellor 
Michael Wanell began to approach 
members of the faculty senate and 
claimed Fairchild was suffering 
from emotional instability 

William Frederick, presiding 
ofiiccr of the faculty senate and 
a.^sociaie professor of computer sci- 
ence, said Wartell approached him 
and began a "character assassinauon 
of Dr. Fairchild." 

Frederick said the chancellor 
had a file on Fairchild with letters 
soUcited from people in adiletics. 
The letters were critical of Fairchild 
and his performance in the athletic

Technology fee finds new home 



Bv Susan Spini^ler 
News E[&gt;rTOR 



Next semester students will 
notice a change on their fee state- 
onenis. The technology fee will no 
longer be listed separately on the 
receipt. Instead, it will be included 
with the tuiticn. 

The reason for this is to benefit 
the students who are eligible for the 
Hope Scholarship 

When the technology fee is 
incorporated with tuition, then tiose 
costs qualify to be paid for by the 
Hc^ Scholarship through tax aed- 



"It is a good deal for the sni- 
dents," said Casey Lengnachcr. 
comptroller for IPSGA. 

The fear is thai if students do not 
know how much they are paying for 
the technology fee then it can be 
raised without anyone knowing 

That is why ihe adimnisirauon is 
working on a way to have the tech- 
nology fee show up separately on 
the bills students receive and have it 
merge with tuition at the mtemal 
level for scholarship purposes, 

"The procedure will remain the 
same." said Lengnacbet "But we 
are looking for ways to advertise die 
change," 



There are avenues to take in 
order to find out how much has been 
charged for a technology fee 
Students can contact financial 
affairs to find a record of the sepa- 
rate charges. 

'To simplify, it will be included 
with tuition," said Mark Franke, 
assistant comptroller "The campus 
service fee will represent all that 
will not qualify for the (tax) credit " 

The new procedure of including 
the technology fee widi tuition will 
be positive for the students who 
qualify for the Hope Scholarship 
because they will be receiving help 
for more of the costs of college.

During the investigation of 
Fairchild's allegations. The 
Communicator discovered wide- 
spread discontent among the faculty. 

Controversy 

"Campus atmosphere 'poi- 
soned " was the headline on Oct, 30 
Frederick. Fairchild and Michael 
Downs, chair and associate profes- 
sor of political science and speaker 
for die lU faculty senate, all said the 
university climate was different. 

Downs said the campus had 
t)ecome polarized with the rea,son- 
able center unable to influence the 
policies that arc being made. 

Downs said be thinks much ot 
the hea_l being directed toward the 
chancellor steins from the percep- 
tion that the chancellor is ignoring 
due process concerning grievances. 
search and screen committees and 
the treatment of university employ- 
ees. 

One employee. Vicki Benecke, 
in charge of faculty records and bud- 
get, has a harassment suit filed 
claming the university created a 
hostile work environment 

Mary Helen Thuente, chair and 



professor of English and hnguistics. 
said the campus climate was "horri- 
ble" and the chancellor is conduct- 
ing a "reign of terror " Thuente also 
criticized the fledgling Campus 
Climate Committee. 

The committee was formed to 
look for ways to improve the cam- 
pus and to make IPFW the "best 
employer" in Fon Wayne. Irene 
Walters, director of university rela- 
uons. said. 

Wallers said the Wednesday 
morning meetings have been suc- 
cessful and have led to many cam- 
pus improvements 

The meetings have been any- 
thing but successful according to 
Thuente She called the committee a 
"joke " 

Most people, Thuente said, are 
reluctant to speak out against the 
chancellor t&gt;ccause they are afraid 
their department's budget will be 
cut. 

Aftershocks 

Last week, the NCAA complet- 
ed Its investigation of the mens bas- 
ketball program 

The NCAA said they found 
some validity in the allegations, but 
that ihey were institutional viola- 
tions rather than violations of 
NCAA bylaws. Only one reported 
violation was a violation of NCAA 
bylaws and that one was handled 



correctly. 

Butch Perchan said the player in 
question was declared ineligible, but 
the player was requested lo be rein- 
suted The NCAA remstaied the 
player 

On Monday, die faculty senate 
rejected the new gnevance proce- 
dures scheduled to go into effect 
Julyl, 

Grievance procedures have been 
a sore point for quite a while at 
IPFW, 

Grievances 

Last Friday, the lU board of fac- 
ulty review released a 24-page 
report detailing a gnevance proce- 
dure against the university filed by 
Gail Hickey. a.ssociate professor of 
education 

Hickey claimed she was 
hara.ssed by Betty Steffy, dean and 
professor of education. 

The board agreed with Hickey 
and recommended that Steffy step 
down as dean because she lacked the 
competence the position needs. 

During the investigation 
process, Thuente, chair of the board 
of review, said die administration 
was difficult to deal wiUi 

'"There have been unprecedent- 
ed obstacles from the administra- 
tion." she said. 

The chancellor has denied 
Hickey's gnevance.

Address change 

Anyone accessing their email accounts this week probably came across 
the information about our campus address changing. 

The new campus address will not include the "mdiana." For example, 
Jon Q Public's new address would be; publjq01@holmes.ipfw.edu. 
Students will still be able to receive mail from outside users incorporating 
the "Indiana" in the address. 

For Uiose diat use lisiserv, a process of unsubscribing and resubscribing 
will be warranted in order to activate that feature. 

The labs for students wiU be open for limited limes over the holiday

Bomb scares affect students, professors 



To THE editor: 

There has been a huge problem 
with bomb scares this semester on 
campus. These scares are making it 
difficult for students and professors 
to attend classes 

The scares have caused several 
buildings to be closed on numerous 
occasions. When a pnmk is called 
in, we as students can't attend a 
class thai day. 

It has been going on for months 
and Ihe person or these persons have 
not been caught I can't remember a 
day tbal a bomb scare was nol called 
in. These scares are getting way out 
of hand and this m\] continue until 
the culprii(s) get caught. 1 with the 
culpritts) would take into considera- 



tion other people's thoughts. My 
parents and 1 don't appreciate 
spending all this money and time on 
an education that I can't receive 
because someone calls in a prank. 
These calls are wasting time and 
money. 

As an IPFW student. 1 am con- 
cerned that these scares are not 
going to Slop until the culprii(s) get 
caught 

I am writing this letter to show 
the culprii(s) and other students to 
have the consideration for those 
who want lo learn. We are all stu- 
dents here so this is afiecting you as 
well, 

1 am silting here trying to under- 
stand why these scares are called in. 
Maybe they're having a hard time 



with work or didn't study for a lest. 
They need to realize that all students 
have 10 go through this process. 
Well, if you can't handle college 
life, you shouldn't be enrolled. 

You can always try next semes- 
ter or the suntmier session. Calhng 
m these scares is not the answer you 
seek. 

Maybe this person chokes when 
a major test is given. The easy way 
out is lo call in a scare, so they 
won't have to lake the test. 
Everyone has to take the lest sooner 
or later, so why not just get it over 
with and move on. 

The culprii(s) should stop call- 
ing in the pranks before they get 
caught I assume we are all here for 
the same reason — to receive an edu- 



caUon. 

When you do this, it's hard to 
meet that goal because we can't 
attend class. 

Please stop calling in the bomb 
scares and think of other students. 
The money and time is not retnev- 
able, but you can help if this prob- 
lem stops. Save yourself from being 
caught and bumihated. I know it 
feels better to help others than lo 
harm them. 



Sincerely concerned.

Bomb threats cause loss of money 



To the editor: 

1 am a non-resident student at 
IPFW. 1 am very perturbed about the 
recent bomb threats at our campus. 

1 pay more than most of ihc 
other students because of my non-

Also, the other students and I 
are behind in ihose classes we have 
missed due to threats, 

I agree that the teachers need to 
stay on schedule with their syllabi, 
but on the other hand, the students 
have to understand what they are 
learning. 

Due to the threats, it may lake 
longer for one class to understand 
the chapter than the others 
Therefore, we may not learn all that 
we need to know to go on to ihe next

including myself, drive 45 minutes

arrive at school to find there is a 
bomb threat, I become irate. 

1 come to school for a reason, to 
further my education, to learn more 
lo improve myself and to pursue a 
good career. 1 don't know the reason 
behind these ihreats but, if it's 
because the individual hasn't stud- 
ied for a test or a mid-term, then 
why did he or she enroll in college? 

There are many students that 
think the bomb thxeats are great 
because they get to gei oui of class. 
Because of these threats what hap- 
pens when students gel behind in the 
missed classes, or even fail? Will 



you still think thai missing that class 
was great? How would you feel 
about the individual(s} responsible 
for the threats then? 

Once the culprit is apprehended, 
instead of paying a fmc to the state, 
he/she should pay back every sm- 
dent for the classes tbey missed. Fair 
compensation owed to me is S250.

Bookstore overcharges 



To THE editor: 

Is anyon? else tired of the cosl 
of leslbooks like I am? 

1 am a fu^l year college student 
and cannot believe die cosl of 
books 1 myself have paid over $100 
for my books, and 1 am sure it is the 
same for the majority of smdents. 

What 1 also do nol understand is 
why they cost so much. 1 realize that 
die bookstore has to be able lo pay 
their employees but not al the 
expenses of the shidenis. 

1 asked ihe textbook manager, 
Jun from the Follett's bookstore, 
why the books cost so much and 
how they decide what they cost. 

Jim said they have a blue value 
book with all the cost of books and 
they can charge up to 25 percent 
over the book value. 

I bought a Communication 114 
book that cost me $4S. When stu- 
dents lake il back, they only get St4 
back. In return, the bookstore will 
charge MO to buy it used. 



$46. 1 am positive that the bookstore 
will tell anyone that they do not 
have anything to do with the cost of 
textbooks. 

They might even say that we do 
nol have to be going to college and 
that it is our choice, so therefore it is 
our responsibility lo pay these high 
prices for books. 

1 think that this is ridiculous. I 
know, being a college student, that I 
can spend my money other ways. 

For one. if 1 did not have lo 
spend so much for my books il 
would leave me with more gas 
money 



I am sure everyone knows the 
feehng of realizing you do not have Sincerely, 
any money. As we all know, it is 
time to start thinking about ihe 
spring semester. 



them on your own. 

If you do nol wish to sell the 
books on your own, make sure you 
sell the books back wiUiin 15 days 
from die start of classes or widiin 
two days days if purchased there- 
after 10 get a full refund. 

If you do not sell Ihem back 
after the time allowed, realize you 
will only get half price or less. 

I still believe the best solution is 
to sell them back on your own and 
let the bookstore know how we feel 
about the cosL 

I am sure, like me, most of you 
do not have the mcmey to waste. 



My suggestion to students is not 
to go sell your books back to the 
bookstore, but to see if you can sell

On Chnsimas eve, two children anxiously 
awajied ihe arrival of their father. As soon as 
he would airive Ihey would all bundle up and 
(ravel to iheir grandpaieni's house (where he had 
already made his fini stop) The 7-ycar-old pressed her 
face againM ihe from window, looking for her dad. 
while the 5-year-old played happily with hct mom on 
the Iloof Tune pasi by slowly that evening, and with tl 
slowly dwindled the anticipation of two young chil- 
dren's expectations of what may have been awaiting 
Ihem at Iheir grandparents. 

Eyes filled with disappointment. Ibe children were 
tucked into bed while their mother gave each a com- 
foning hug and reassuring hope thai diis year would 
not be Lke the last Although tbey were young, they had 
already become accusl(»iied to such disappointments 
and could only share in the comfon and reassurance 
CRptcssed on each occa.s]on by their mommy because 
they knew their daddy would never show, 

It soon became eaily morning, about the lime Santa 
should be sliding down the chimney, when the father 
finally arrived. Hoping that no one was up, he slowly 

staggered 
bouse. With little 
concept of direction 
be made his way through 
the kitchen and was 
swaying before the tree 
had all shared in decorai 
ing just days ago With 
tears in his eyes be 
stood before the tree, 
withdrew a bottle he had 
become accustomed 
to carrying in his "= 
pocket and took a " 
large swig. He knew he 
would soon need _ c 
the liquid 
courage to fac« his loved 
ones, for he knew once again he 




had failed himself as well as diem. Taking a deep 
breath, he turned from the tree and as he did he lost bis 
balance, falling backward into the only symbol of 
Christmas they would .share thi.s year. 

Hearing the noise, the children awoke from their 
slumber Starry eyed and filled with renewed anticipa- 
tion they ran to see what Santa had left them. When 
ihey anivcd, to their surprise, instead of presents, there 
lied Iheir father draped over the tree he had knocked to 
the door. With a sad look on his face, glazed eyes, and 
in a mournful, mumbled voice be spoke: "I'm sorry." 

I wish I could say that I rcmember that day. but I 
can only recap what was presented to me the ncit day 
by my wife and children. I got off work early Christmas 
Eve and thought I would stop before going home for 
some Christmas cheer just to get into the mood. You 
know, enough to put the thoughts of work behind me 
and get into die spirit of the season But once I started, 
I continued I even promised myself ahead of time I 
would only have one. or was it two? But without fail, it 
soon became three and four and then more I drank 
myself into a blackout and from that point on. 1 had no 
memory of what happened. 

No one moved me from that spot where I had 
pa.sscd out that morning and shortly after I awoke, I 
knew thai I had once again crossed the fine line I so 
many times before attempted to stay behind The fine 
Lne that I could drink like others and the denial of the 
fact that I was an alcoholic became a rcabty once again. 
Today. I am able to make that clear disiinciion. In 
realizing that I am an alcoholic. 1 have made the choice 
not to drink That choice has 
" changed my life 
^ ^ Even though I was unable to 
salvage a marriage. I 
able to renew a rela- 
tionship wiOi my two daugh- 
ters. Since that 
Christmas in 1985, 
we have been able to 
enjoy the meaning of 
Chnsimas as a family, 
IS well as enjoy a 
&gt;:s-vw- ( ^^ father/daughter relation-

Where to go if there is a problem 



Sponsored by tme IPFW 
Substance Abuse Council 

Alcohol is a toxic depressant 
drug. It is similar lo die anesthetic 
drag called ether Since it is a 
depressant, ii can change the body 
by slowing the heart rate, cause 
slow breathing and create major 
body systems to stop functioning 
altogether 

Alcohol used alone or in con- 
junction widi other drags can kiU 
Not only does alcohol cause 
changes in the functioning of the 
brain, it can cause mood swings, 
hinder one's ability to think clearly 
and decrease reaction time in dri- 
ving. 

Alcohol is ijuickly and direcdy 
absorbed into the bloodsueam 
without being digested. Absorption 
can be slowed down if there is food 
in the stomacb Water m food slows 
alcohol's entry into the blood. 
However, all of the alcohol still gets 
into the blood. Some people falsely 
believe they can speed up the alco- 
hol's exit frran the body What they 
do not know is that the oxidation 
process bas its own clock The 
human body can burn up about one- 
half ounce of alcohol in one hoia 

Please note thai one-half ounce 



pure ethyl alcohol is contained i 
typical serving of any one of these 
standard servings of beer, wine or 
hcjuor. For example. 'a 12-blince 
bottle of beer has the same amount 
of alcohol as a 5-ounce glass of 
wine which bas the same amount of 
alcohol as a one and a half ounce 
glass of liquor It is importint lo 
recognize that alcohol inioxicaiion 
IS dependent upon the amount of 
ethyl alcohol consumed, not the 
number of drinks consumed 

Keep in mind the holidays are 
approaching and how you experi- 
ence them wiU depend on your 
sound judgement. Often, 
tecausc alcohol is a legal drag, 
many tmnimize its ability to do 
harm or cause a variety of negative 
conse&lt;^uenccs If you, or anyone 



you know, is experiencing an alco- 
hol problem or think you may have 
one, please note some of the-eom- 
tnorl symptoms! ' '

-blackouts

Bloomington, Ind. — The two 

bnghlest planets. Venus and Jupiier, 
will be on display in the same pan ot 
the southwestern sky December 
evenings after sunset. Venus will be 
at its brightest for the year on Dec 
11. about 16 times bnghier than 
Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. 

Jupiter will be to die upper left 
of Venus, not quite as bright but still 
a bnUiant companion. It's as if they 
are reminiscmg about an extremely 
rare astronomical event dial is one 
of several Uieoncs on the possible 
identity of the "star of Bedilehem " 

Early in the evening of June 17, 
2 BC, Jupiter and Venus merged 
into a daz/ling "star'' near the west- 
ern horizon, according to calcula- 
tions of modem astronomers. In 
countries to east of what was then 
the kingdom of Judea observers 
could have seen the fused planets as 
a beacon in the direction of 
Jerusalem. 

Astrologers associated Jupiter 
with die birth of kings and Venus 
wiih fertihty. ihe meeting of Jupiter 
and Venus look place m ihe consiel- 




hsSLaZ 



DoHie Porch and Leah Sheets sky for a block during this season 

Origins of the 'Star of 
Bethleliem' sought 



lauon of Leo the Lion, which the 
Old Testament of the Bible specifi- 
cally associated with ihe Jewish 
people And it happened near the 
bnghlest star in Leo. Reguli 
closely identified with kingship. 

There has not been a brighter, 
closer meeting of Venus and Jupiter 
in Leo so near Regulus in the 2,000 
years before or smce. Could this be 
the event that caused a group of 
astrologers called the Wise Men to 
travel to Jerusalem in search of a 
new king almost 2,000 years ago? 
No one knows, but the possibility is 
tantalizing. 

A number of asuonomers and 
historians have tried to determine 
what die "star of Bedilehem" could 
have been, but there is no consensus 
So htUe Is known histoncally about 
die time Jesus was bom dial diere is 
no reliable way to answer the ques- 
tion.

Smokin' hash marks: Scott Via, 



^■i^ 



I eased 
back into ihe 
couch, flipping 
through chan- 
nels hke a librar- 
ian on speed 
going dirough a 
card catalog. 

There 

wasn't much of 

a choice at 2 

a.m., so it was 

either Tony Robbins or one of those 

treadmill glider things, which, acni- 

ally, I was half-tempted to buy at the 

lime considering ^^^^^^^^^^ 




my half-con- 
scious slate of 
mind. 

But anyway, 
my seemingly 
endless search 
came to an 
abrupt halt as I 
stopped on 
ESPN 2, on 
which there was 
a late college 
basketball game 
from Ihe west 
coast I can't 
even remember 
who was play- 
ing, bull think it 
was something 
like Pepperdine 
al Gonzaga. bul 
it didn't really 
maticr becau.se it 
keiball 



athletes for that matter • running 
should be. is. and always will be a 
form of punishment and not ihe lone 
purpose I'll throw soccer onto the 
list, too, because it's extremely bor- 
mg to waich. 

There's just not enough scoring. 
which IS fine, because hockey isn't 
extremely high scoring either, bul 
I'm pretty sure I'd change my opin- 
ion if some little guy in those nylon 
soccer shorts hip-checked someone 

Anyway, as much as I adore all 
odier sports, nothing can come even 
close to the almost creepy, passion- 
ate obsession 



that I have for 
college basket- 
ball. 



Nothing can bring out 



THE RANGE OF EMOTIONS 



THE WAY THAT SPORTS ■ 



AND MORE SPECIFICALLY 



BASKETBALL - CAN 



was college bas- 



Which brings me to not only the 
poini of this column, bul also a uni- 
versal truth - an epiphany if you 
will 

As 1 slumped over on the couch, 
half awake ;uid half asleep, staring 
intently and basking in the warm 
glow of Lhc TV, I came lo one simple 
conclusion - college basketball 
rules. 

I love all sports, or ai least a 
great majority except probably track 
Mid cross country and boUi lor die 
same reason, there's jusl simply too 
much funning. To real sports - and 



I 
digress, so back 
to the pre -dawn 
game the other 
night 1 don't 
remember much 
about It except 
thai It was a 
close game all 
the way through 
and Gonzaga - 
or what i 
thought was 
Gonzaga - won 
on a last-second 
shot 

I was 
^ i^——^^^^^— elated and have 
no idea why, 
except die fact that I was totally 
engrossed in ibe drama. The 
Gonzagian natives erupted as the 



clock ran out and Peppenline looked 
as is if in a few seconds each of their 
mothers had died 

Obviously they hadn't died and 
if Uiey had I'm going to feel really 
bad. bul that's nol the pomi The 
point Ls this: Nothing can bring out 
the range of emotions the way that 
spons - and more specifically bas- 
ketball ■ can, which might be sad for 
me considering I don't even play 
anymore. 

Which brings me to another 
point, being able to live vicariously 
dirough the little men on the TV is 
important for me to fulflll my 
dreams, considering my 5-foot-lO. 
overweight frame will never play a 
tick m college, unless they have a 
national H-0-R-S-E tournament. 

Another great thing about col- 
lege basketball, and follow me on 
diis one. is that it's nol the NBA. No 
contract negotiations or holdouts. 
No 24-sccond clock or millionaires. 

These kids, which I can say 
because I'm older than half of them, 
don't get paid to play even though 
they bring in milhons and millions 
of dollars to their respective schools. 

It might sound cxtremelv naive 
on my pan, bul 1 honestly believe 
Uiat they play for the love of the 
game 

The love of the game. It's often 
overlooked, but as I was lying there, 
drifting in and out of sleep I realized 
dial's why diey were playing. 

And why I was watching.
