bear Editors: 

Last week I read several 
articles statirip the "maul- 
inr, bone-bresking-" treatcent 
of the flapr-gootball team the 
"Nads" by the so called "not- 
orious" team, "The Train". 
Never in my entire life have 
I heard such frossly distort- 
ed and biased exarperations 
of the facts. There are many 
ways of making a point, but 
is it really necessary to put 
in a one-sided and eiraggerat- 
ed account of what really hap- 
pened'^ I think not! 

The team "The Train" mauled 
no one, I have to admit that 
perhaps a few girls may have 
been treated a little too rourh- 
ly, but no matter how careful 
a guy is, a slip-up will occur 
where someone is hurt slightly. 
There were no major injuries! 
For the players that were hurt 
then, I .sympathize with you, 
but you should expect some bru- 
ises. The experienced "Beav- 
ers" had more bruises; hov/ever, 
the;/ knew what to expect thus 
they had no complaints. "Nads," 
I know you v/ant to have some 
fun, but even in fun bruises 
will occur, .^o you can either 
fret used to a few bruises or 



Dear iiditorc:. 

hany thanks for continu-

Marty Kartinez, 

In his latest effort, in 
reference to girls football, 
he says he cannot underst::nd 
sex discrimination. Having 
been on the receiving end of 
this discriir.ination I do un- 
derstand it, but I don't un- 
derstand why the girls toler- 
ate it v/hen they needn't. 

If there was no referee 
to throv/ out the offending 
male players why didn't the 
girls oust quit? terhaps

field is no place for "ladies"! 

I wEint to also state that 
there were referees at this

i:;ince there were only a few 
penalties called, somebody bet-

accusing a team of trj-ing to 
"kill" the "Nads" for having 
Eupi osedly entered the males

went to the extent of glorify- 
ing the "Kads" to the point of 
calling them "ladies". Is a

No doubt we will need more

be respect for life, for free-

there will be humble love of

October 15, 1S71 



by Kark -"^r^nke. Student Body 
Iresident 

Three weeks ago, I made a 
few observations on the current 
status of the Bill of Student 
Rights and Responsibilities. 
At that time I theorized that 
the Bill was being subjected 
to r.any procedural and techni- 
cal roadblocks in hope that it 
would die from lack of momen- 
tum. 

ije have now been confronted 
with a ver^- formidable impasse: 
C. n. Lawshe, Vice Iresident 
for Kegional Campus iidministra- 
ticn. After reviewing the Bill 
at the request of the i-urdue 
Faculty ^jfnate, he returned it 
with his recommendations. 

He seeced ratlier concerned 
that there existed "extensive 
overlap" between the Bill and 
the present lurdue Ltudent 
Conduct Code and adJninictra- 
tive procedures already es- 
tablished by the 1 resident's 
Office, 

He did not, however, ex- 
plain why such overlap was so 
inlierently evil. Kor did he 
adequately explain whj he is 
not "prepared to tal:e it to 
the I'reeident or the Board 
in its present form":, othei 
than for the fact there is 
overlap with other documents. 
To me, this coii-plaint is a 
very superficial one . 

Further more, lio complain- 
ed of excets verbiage used in 
the Bill concerning matters 
not specifically der.ling with 
lights and responsibilities 
of Fort V-ayne students. 

Does he feci that the sec- 
tion on access to hifT-her ed- 
ucation is not a right of 
Fort '.jayne students'; 

1 erhaps he does not feel 
that i'ort "v.'ayne students have 
the right of assembly. Or of 
protest. Or of privacy. Or 
of self-government. 

Or maybe he does not think 
that Fort *.Jayne students 
should have any academic rights. 
These are the matters dealt 
with by the Bill. 

Which of these are includ- 
ed in the "many matters which 
doesn't speak to the. quest- 
ion, "..'h:^t are the riphts and 
responsibilities of Fort Wayne 
students':'" I do not know. 

A third comcent made by 
the Vice j-recident was that 
the Bill conflicted in cer- 
tain areas with the present 
Student Conduct Code. 

lie sugger-ted that instead 
of including thes e points in 
the Bill of .^tudent Eights 
and Responsibilities we should 
ai nd the present regulations. 
.16 al'^o stated that so long 
£;. these conflicts do exist, 
the University Counsel could 
not provide "a meaningful 
legal reaction to the docu- 
ment. " Unfortunately, he 
did not outline those areas 



of the Bill that are in con- 
flict. 

His final criticism is 
that we should "separate re- 
gulatory and procedural mat- 
ters from basic conceptual 
ones." This criticism is 
invalid. 

The first six pages of the 
Bill enumerate the rights and 
responsibilities of students, 
and the I'dvi five j.-irps jxe 
the Operrtional Guidelines 
and irocedures for tlie first 
six, 

-til of thene rijasone for 
rejecting the B;. ii seen very 
superficicl to re, as well 
at to maiij otheiE . iJean 
Lcwshe onl^ hinted at the 
real reason for his opposi- 
tion to t'lc :Jill. lit; cugf ec- 
tcd that v;fi should "prcpEre 
a ntu draft confined to ti.ose 
topics and areas tre ted in 
the Lafayette Bill of ijtuaeiits 
Eights. " 

The attituce of the Lj^f- 
ayette adrr.inif.tration becomes 
obvious with this lart state- 
irent. Either we use Lsfayet- 
te's Bill of otuaent Eights 
or v/e won't use one at ell. 
Ko other t&gt;;. e of document will 
be cccei-table to the Vice- 
's reritiant. 

This logic ignores the in- 
herent differences hotv;^en 
Lafa,-iette njxC irort ..ayne. 
Fort uayne is .-&lt; corimutGr cam- 
pus, and not a residential one. 
-.Iso, some 55yu of the Fort 
Uayne students are not students 
of lurdue University. 

iiow Uean Lawshe can feel 
th£t the orly a | ropriate b^EJv 
for Fort '■layne is the one now 
in use in Lafayette is beyond 
me. 

oucli thought, -lowever, is 
con.^istent v;itii the philoso- 
phy of the Office of" Regional 
Crjr.-ous j^drainlstration. "If 
it's good for Lafayette, it's 
good for t'^.e vjorld , " is a 
j-hiloEophy that lends legiti- 
mac; to its I'Olic. of region- 
al cpjnpu£ colonialism. 

Our only recourse ir to 
Tobilize student supi-ort be- 
hind the Bill, i recently, 
there are petitions circulat- 
ing throughout the campus urg- 
ing faculty senate passage of 
the Bill. 

I ask all students to sign 
these petitions.

Bittersweet life 

Let me rest in tranquil de- 
solation on the hot mountain 
in the noonday sun 
Or wander in moonlit snow- 
banks by half frozen streams. 

Let the problems of Existence 
be forgotten 

In the close sensation of burn- 
ing sun and choking dust 
Or the numbing sting of glove- 
less hands in winter. 

Love may truly be eternal 
but life, love's sustenance, 
is measured as a glass of wine 
which bitter drunk is only 
borne 

Yet sweet brings satisfaction.

Many jeople, too nany per- 
haps, feel that the hirrhest 
form of patriotism is to blind- 
ly accept any decree from any 
quthority, and to try to quiet 
any individual or frroup that 
darec to challenge either the 
decree or the authority, fa- 
ther than beinf: a fom of pa- 
trictiL3!T, this blind accej:t- 
once may well be a nio-'^t sub- 
tle fore of trerron — because 
of itFi nonsennencGE. 

Derrocracy reqnirer, constant 
aui'Srvision-, democracy provides 
the means b:, which to effect 
such supervision. Unless the 
leaders in a democracy are in- 
structed in v;hat direction to 
lend, and informed vhen they 
an,- roinf: astray, the leader 
is no lender at all. Unless 
the individual citizen accepts 
the res] onsibility of instruct- 
ing and informing his elected 
officials, he abrop;c:tes his 
role as a citizen of a den;o- 
cracy. 

If the citizens do not im- 
pone their collective v/ill upon 
their leadeis, their leaders 
will imyose their individual 
or special intere.'^t wills upon 
the citizens. Democracy de- 
pends on feedback of informa- 
tion from the citizens to their 
elected representatives; but, 
like ,iustice, democrncy is mean- 
ingful onl: when abl.y controlled 
and administered. The citizen 
mur.t reoain free enour;h to con- 
stantly challenp-e the system, 
and must maintain a sufficient 
sense of resfonsibility to do 
so. The challenge of loyal 
citizens provinfc the strength 
of the system is what keeps the 
system strong. 
! However, in this apathetic 
j ?re, the main desire seems to 
be towards conforming and fol- 



I 



lowinr the path of least re- 
sistance. The only emotion 
aroused seens to be against 
the activist vho tries '-o point 
out that all is not (aprle) 
"pie in the sky." Resentment 
seems to be not so much against 
the viev;s of the activist, as 
it is against the fact that he 
dares to express those views, 
and attemi ts to enact them. 
Cur lethargic populace doesn't 
want to "get involved" in any- 
thing thr.t would make them in 
anyi'jay uncomfortable. 

Because of this, the act- 
ivist left and the activist 
right have found themselves 
the most uncommon of all allies 
on certain issues, '.vhile their 
recorimended soluticnt- certain- 
ly differ, their probinr^ to 
fct at the "root" of problems 
has led them to espouse or 
oppose certain isrues and cer- 
tain people in conunon. Both 
are using "the system". Both 
are forcinn: the system to shed 
itself of the bureaucratic dust 
r-nd cobwebs which disinterest 
and leth?&gt;rgj have allowed to 
develop. The hope of our coun- 
try lies with these activists 
who are determined to make the 
system work. 

There are those among us who 
keep saying that r. capitalistic 
democracy is unworkable. The 
conceit of capitalism is be- 
yond the scope of this article, 
but it is a separate and sep- 
arable entity from the concept 
of democracy. Democracy is a 
result and not a philosophy. 

Democracy simply guarantees 
the right of all selfish in- 
terest groups the right to pre- 
sent their views to the public, 
and the rir-ht to vie for pub- 
lic support. The corrective 
mechanisms built into our laws 
guarantee that his t^-pe of 
activism will result in a heal- 
thy society. Kadical rightists 
are trying to keep their strong 
hold on this procedure; radi- 
cal leftists are struggling 
to make the democratic process 
available to the poor minorit- 
ies. Both are active, and 
both are in the best interest 
of our country. Both seem to 
antagonize the silent majority, 
pseudo-radical , and super- 
patriot. . .left or right.

Mexican -American leaders 
of R)rt Wayne meet at l-PU 



Leaders of the Fort Wayne 
Hex i can- American corariunity 
held a meetinp at lU-rU Reg- 
ional recently, ajid were tre- 
ated to an hour of stiraulat- 
inr^ i^panish conversation v/ith 
members of the i-panish table 
v/hich meets in the Cafeteria 
every Thursday from 11:30 to 
1:50. 

During the hour, campus 
members received a briefing 
on the educational needs of 
the Mexican-American commun- 
ity. The Community leaders, 
in turn, received some insirht 
on how iU-lU Regional is work- 
ing to meet those needs. 

Because of the late arrival 
of some members, the group v;as 
not able to meet v/ith Dr. John 
Ulmer, who has been active in 
makine; Regional facilities re- 
sponsive to the special needs 
of racial minorities. However, 
Dr. Ulmer did provide sojr.e 
preliminary information for 
the group's consideration. 

oUch interaction has been 
the common goal of both Dr. 
Ulmer ond Tony Guellar, I'resi- 



dent of the United I.exicen- 
/imericans. Inc. Free. Cuellar 
has led the Mexican-,.merican 
community in developing ed- 
ucational programs, from basic 
language through college pre- 
paratory courses. 

He has also been instru- 
mental in ananging, through 
lU-l-U Regional, various brief- 
ing programs to inform r^exican- 
Americcn students of the bene- 
fits of, and opportunities foi', 
a college education. 

"Education is one of the 
major needs of the Mexican- 
^■.icericiui today," Cuellar said, 
"\ie are anxious to prove that 
what we need is a chance, not 
charity." 

Fort Wayne lU-IU liegicnal 
is working to provide that , 
chance. With t)ie interest of 
the Spanish language fi-culty 
and the sup^ ort of Dr. Ulmer 's 
staff, qualified, Hexicsui- 
American students will find 
that in the words of lurdue 
AdmiiTsions Officer,' John Hal-

Mastodons defeat NT, 
bow to Manchester 



Splitting its second and 
third home pames^ the Kasto- 
don soccer team hiked its re- 
cord to 5-5. On Thursday, 
Oct. 7i the local kickers were 
soundly beaten by I-ianchester, 
6-2. 

They bounced back with a 
convincing 4-1 win over Indiana 
Institute of Technology on Kon- 
day, Oct. 11. 

In Thursday's game, lU-PU 
was outplayed by a v;ell-or- 
ganized fianchester team, Man- 
chester coirpletely dominated 
first quarter action but the 
period ended in a scoreless 
tie. 

At ^:l0 of the second quar- 
ter Al Fleek scored on the 
Hastodon's first shot on goal. 
Ilanchester then scored two 
goals within a irdnute, the 
goals coEiinf from Lynn Eiken- 
berry and Ed bhsnkster. 

lU-IU then tied the score 
with only its second shot on 
goal !&gt;t 11:55 of the second 
(juarter. Al Fleek co.l lided 
v;ith the I-ianchester goalie, 
and Hector Tuesca punched the 
loose ball in for the Mastodons, 

The second half was all Man- 
chester as they scored four 



unanswered goals. Eikenberry 
and Shank ster each scored two 
more goals for the winners. 

The score of the game was 
reflected by the shots on goal, 
with Manchester getting 28 to 
I.U.-F.U. 's 5. 

The fired-up Mastodon's 
looked like a different team 
in Monday's game with IIT. 
Their passing was sharp and 
they had many near misses be- 
sides their 4 goals. 

I.U.-P.U. scored the first 
5 goals of the game. Goalie 
John Baker scored on a pen- 
alty shot at 2:12 of the se- 
cond quarter. Denny Huber 
scored next at 12:2? on an 
assist from Fleek. 

Greg Yager opened the third 
quarter scjiaring by heading a 
ball in on another assist from 
^leek. 

Mastodon goalie Baker then 
lo^t his shutout bid as Gee 
scored for IIT at 20:26 of the 
third quarter. 

Al Fleek closed the scoring 
at 1:15 of the fourth quarter, 
making the final score 4-1. 

lU-PU had 20 shots on goal 
to IIT's 10. 



Football roars into second week 



by Tom } enzone 

Flag football roared into 
its second big week with 
last Sunday's games. 

One of the more decisive 
wins saw Aschbacher's team 
breeze past the Greasers 
in a 5C-0 win. 

Stove Otter.vellei' spurred 
Aschbfic&gt;ier's defense with 
four lasE interceptions. As 
if the interceptions weren't 
enoug'- , Cteve also rt: turner 
a Greasers punt for a touch- 
down. Ottenvjeller wasn't the 
only -standout for Aschbacher. 

Rick Knight and Ion IJiel- 
ler tallied two TDs ajiece, 
and Marty Farrell passed to 
Greg Fl-isinger for another. 

Ambrose's team slipped by 
Farrell 's with a 6-0 win. 
John Ghonas latched on to a 
twice deflected pass from 
Jobji iiayes and zipped into 
the end zone for the only 
score of the game. 

Farrell ' s team in the 
latter stag;es of the contest 
bulled their way to Ambrose's 
■ five yard line, but were un- 
able to CE:pitalir:e on their 
effort as Ambrose's defense- 
men walled up ti e goal line. 

Walters and ILvarts out- 
lasted ICrause and won their 
encounter 18-12. .The losse 
hung the Beavers with a 57- 
C win. Reed 1 erry rolled 
over Mcl-iahon, winning 18-C. 

The Hads clipped Johnsonfe 
team by forfiet, making 
this Johnson's second forfiet 
in as rany wc©i-.s of play. 



The Train scored a su- 
prising 18-15 viin over Hoehn- 
Hoy. H.k. loaded the score- 
board last week and it Icok- 
ed as though they were the 
most powerful team in the 
second division. However, 
Jaworsky got his box cars 
together and proved differ- 
ently. 

Cook and VJoolems battled 
to a 6-f tie. Both teams 
displayed stron defensive 
squads but their offences 
v/ere not able to generate 
ruch in the way of scoring 
punch. Each scoring effort 
came after the defense had 
set the ball deep in the op- 
positions territory. 

John Willisms reports he 
v.ould like to have the game 
ball returned v/bich was ac- 
cidentley removed last v/eek- 
end, John also expressed his 
aprreciation for the squad's 
efforts reguarding the use 
of the- newly placed trash 
barrels. 

Remember captains, drop

Communicator office recap- 
ping your victories and 
we'll see that they make 
the following Friday's pub- 
lication.
