Onemonlli afterTom Henry took 
the oath of office in 2008 as Fort 
WajTie's 35th mayor, he said: "Next 
year, I'll take tlie plunge." 

Henry last February was referring 
to the annual Polar Plunge. He spoke 
then as emcee at (he University of 
Saint Francis' Mirror Lake for this an- 
nual fundraiser for Special Olympics 
of Indiana. 

One year later, on Valentine's Day, 
he did it. 

This event raised nearly $18,000. 
and many of the participants were 
students and teachers. Ofthe 79 to- 
tal plungers, the largest group was 6 
teachers and 16 students from Leo 
High School, who raised more than 
S2,000. Leo High School also hosts 
the Special Olympic competition for 
the Fori Wayne area each year. 

Mayor Henry went feel first, can- 
nonball style, thrilling (he hundreds 
braving the February' cold. Why? "I 

agreed to help 

Special Olym- 
pics with their 
Polar Plunge 
because I be- 
lieve in tlie 
organization 
and its mis- 
sion," Henry 
said. 



"When I see a 

Special Olympian 

enjoy success at 

a sport, I know 

tiiere is a family 

behind that 

athlete wuho is 

plained: cheering them 

'When I was on, coaching from 

mv3iv!!r^ the sidelines, and 

my family was 

privUeged to encouraging them 
know many to do their best" 

people with ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
special needs 

and we got to know them as individ- 
uals. When I see a Special Olympian 
"SI enjoy success at a sport, I know there 
is a family behind that athlete who is 
cheering them on, coaching from the 
sidelines, and encouraging them to 
do their besi, 1 want to be part of that 
cheering section, for all our Special 
Olympians." 

This year's event marked the lOlh 
annual Polar Plunge and the 40th an- 
niversary of Special Olympics of In- 
diana. The Indiana Special Olympics 
Regional Track and Field meet will 
be held Saturday, May 2, at Leo High 
SchooL

IPSGA website renovated, provides more information 




Recently your Vice 
President of Finance. 
Erik Sliepherd, mas- 
sively reworked that IP- 
SGA website. The new 
design enliances both 
the aesthetics of the site 
and the ease of use. The 
overall amount of con- 
tent has been increased 
dramatically and more 
is on its way. Our hope 
is to make the website

a valuable tool for anyone 

who would like informa- 
tion about anything and 
everything relating to stu- 
dent government at IPFW, 

I encourage all to take 
a look through the site 
and let us know ivhat you 
think. Any ideas can be 
sent to us through die on- 
line suggestion form lo- 
cated on the main page. 
This electronic submis-

phase out the obnoxious 
blue suggestion boxes lo- 
cated around campus. 

Special thanks go to 
Erik Shepherd for the time 



and energy he put into 
the website. His skills in 
web design allowed IPS- 
GA to have a professional 
website without using 
the students' money to 
pay someone to do it for 
a large price. 

I should aiso add that 
this will be my last seg-

running for IPSGA office

The Presidential Honeymoon: The Tumultuous First Days 

Obama administration not immune to criticism from both political parties 



ByDanJehl 

Oan.Jehleipfwtommunicatof.org 



Every newly elected official, especially a newly elected U.S. president, ex- 
periences a honeymoon when they assume office. The "first 100 days" is often 
called the honeymoon for a new president, a period when some of the most sig- 
nificant pieces of legislation m American history are passed. This is also often 
the busiest legislative periods for Congress ever. Yet it seems President Barack 
Obama has been hit by Washington gridlock, generally a post-honeymoon busi- 
ness as usual thing. 

The "honeiTTioon" staned on January 21, the day after the Obama inaugu- 
ration. Since then, some of fiis appointees have had unsmooth sailing; Com- 
merce Secretary nominee Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Health 
and Human Services nominee former U.S. Senator Tom Daschel claimed they 
"forgot" to pay taxes in the past, and withdrew their names. Now, Secretary of 
Stale Hillary Clinton is under scrutiny for failing to be a unanimous choice- for 
the position. This is allegedly a result of her husband's involvement with the 
Clinton Foundation for world causes like AIDS prevention. 

On the legislative front, the Obama signed five federal laws, four of them 
major. One was a four-year authorization of the State Children's Health Insur- 
ance Program, a proposal similarto one vetoed twice by President Bush last 
year. Each bill became progressively more difficult to enact, with the first being' 
nearly unanimous and the fifth bill, the stimulus package, only having the sup- 
port of three Republicans in the Senate and zero in the House. 

The economy and the stimulus have taken center stage thus far. The Iraq 
plan is imder study although a phase one will now see some Iraq troops going 
to Afghanistan soon. 

Senator John McCain said Obama was "off to a bad be^nning." McCain criti- 
cized Obama's housing stop-foreclosures plan and his sdmulus plan, saying the 
Obama administration is not keeping its pledge to "sit dovm together." 

McCain \vasn't alone in this accusation. "If this is going to be bipartisanship, 



the cotmtrys screwed," Republican senator Lindsey Graham from South Caro- 
lina said told ABC when referring to the stimulus plan, "I know bipartisanship 
when I see it." 

Even staunch progressive supporters have been snipping. The American

Scavenging the IRA Jungle 

IVlutual funds less risky, insulate investors 



By Jessie Ruckman 

Jeisle.Ruckman 
Otpfwconununtutor.org 

Though we hear it 
on the news and read it 
in the newspapers every 
day, I'll reiterate. The fi- 
nancial world is a mess: 
stocks are consistently 
slumping downward, the 
housing market is still 
searching for the bottom, 
and U.S. workers fear for 
their jobs. So what does 



that mean for the young 
investor? 

Oddly enough, a 
slumping marketmeans 
to invest now, but do It 
wisely Now is a great 
time to buy stocks in 
bulk, because the prices 
have been slashed. It's 
like Wall Street decided 
to have a bargain base- 
ment blowout, and all 
young investors are in- 
vited. Some investors 
might hesitate, thinking 



it might be a good idea to 
just wait out the financial 
crunch, until markets be- 
come more stable (and 
hence, prices rise). 

However, since the 
stock markets are down 
overall, the savvy inves- 
tor might spend the same 
amount of money he or 
she did one year ago. If 
they did keep their bottom 
line the same, they would 
end up purchasing more 
stocks for a lower price. 



These stock market 
slumps won't last forever, 
so now is a great time to 
put your money where 
your mouth is. But what 
are some of the smartest 
choices? Let's talkmutual 
funds. 

Mutual funds are 
made up of many stocks 
that are housed un- 
der the same umbrella. 
There are many different 
mutual funds around, 
so it's a wise idea to do 
some research and find 
out which fund looks 
the best to you. A large 
percentage of my 401 (k) 
retirement fund is com- 
prised of mutual funds, 
a diversified portfolio 
of different stocks all 
blended together in oiie 
fund. These funds are ex- 
tremely safe, and have a 
steady growth rate. 

Think of it this way: if 
one stock out of thirty in 



your fund tanks, twenty- 
nine others are picking 
up the slack and prob- 
ably still groiving. If you 
put all of your money 
into one or txvo stocks 
and one tanks, you could 
lose incredible amounts 
of cash. But, sinceyou 
have invested money 



into multiple stotrks, your 
portfolio is inherently in- 
sulated from huge loss- 
Mutual funds insu- 
late investors from those 
types of high-risk gam- 
bles, and save them fi-om 
catastrophe.

Civil Liberties Union 
criticized Obama for 
proposing a faith-based 
initiative that did not 
ban the practice of re- 
ligious preferences by 
social service agencies 
taking federal' money, 
saying Obama promised 
to do so. The American 
Federation of Labor and 
Congress of Industrial 
Organizations recently 
criticized Obama for 
calling for limits on "Buy 
American" provisions in 



the stimulus package, a 
bill aimed at increased 
spending for US prod- 
ucts and services. 

Ail this and more at 
the one-third mark of the 
traditional 100-day hon- 
eymoon period. 

Is this bumpy road 
honeymoon normal or is 
the Obama honeymoon 
over before it started? 

History shows Con- 
gress passed Roosevelt's 
"New Deal" bur not with- 
out opposition. Lyndon 



B. Johnson's historic Civil 
Rights and Voting Rights 
Acts were passed with 

much debate. 

Clinton's honeymoon 
spurred then-Speaker of 
House Newt Gingrich to 
form the "Contract W\th 
America" and to chal- 
lenge Clinton's every 
move. Ronald Reagan 
also found that enact- 
ing his proposals did not 
come easy. 

"No political honey- 
moon is without some 



bumps," IPFW political 
science professor Andy 
Downs said, "Congress 
may not be controlled 
by the President's pait&gt;'. 
Even if Congress is con- 
trolled by the President's 
party, the majority may 
be slight or there may be 



in- fighting over priori- 
ties." 

These honeymoon peri- 
ods are meant to be bumpy 
by design. The founding 
fathers built it that way. 
Cheeks and balances, rep- 
resentative elected lawmak- 
ers who can be voted in and 



voted out, people able to ex- 
press their opinions freely, 
and freedom of the press are 
built-in features that ensure 
honeymoons will not be 
completely smooth for any 
new American president.

IPFW's Hispanos Unidos participates 
in College Bowl to benefit children 



By Dan Jehl 

D3nJehJ@iptwcamniunica lor.org 



IPFW's Hispanos Uni- 
dos went bowling in the 
2009 College Bowl, spon- 
sored by Big Brothers Big 
Sisters (BBBS) of North- 
east Indiana. 

BBBS is one of die 
fastest growing volun- 
teer organizations in the 
nation, and some of its 
programs focus on the 
Hispanic community, the 
fasting growing group in 
Port Wayne, now com- 
prising eight percent of 
the city's population. 

Hispanos Unidos, an 
IPFW student organiza- 
tion interested in His- 
panic culture and ac- 
tivities, Reided a bowling 
team in the annual Bowl- 
ing for Kids' Sake CoUege 
Bowl at Indiana Tech on 
February !8. 

Raquel A. Kline, His- 
panos Unidos President 
and IPFW Spanish major, 
said, "1 did get involved 
because it is great orga- 
nization that truly makes 
a difference in people's 
lives. I also wanted to be 



involved because 1 want- 
ed our Latino population 
(to have] the same op- 
portunities as everyone 
else." 

BowLng for Kids' Sake 
is the BBBS' largest fund- 
raiser. According to Ex- 
ecutive Director losette 
Rider funds from Bowl- 
ing for Kids' Sake support 
programsinnortheastln- 
diana and south central 
Michigan for more than 
1,800 children, including 
934 in Allen County and ' 
twelve percent of His- 
panic heritage. 

Rider explained BBBS 
offers professionally- 
supported volunteer ser- 
vices to reduce children's 



risk of dropping out of 
school, becoming vio- 
lent, using drugs and al- 
cohol, and falling victim 
to other negative cycles. 

"We recognize the 
hardship, pain and chal- 
lenges children in our 
communities confront," 
said Rider, "The move- 
ment to serve Hispanic 
children Is relevant, 
and there is an urgent 
demand for what we 
achieve."

Wild Sweet Orange 
is an Indie/Altemaiive 
band from Birmingham, 
AL Having two EPs and 
one album, the band has 
been struggling to make 
it to the bigs as an In- 
die band. Their website 
states that their music is 
an "intijnale and individ- 
ualistic sound that veers 
unrestrained from ach- 
ing intimacy to a turbu- 
lent, seething intensity," 

Although some say 
their music is too mel- 
low, it puts out enough 
energy to get you think-

Saving Abel &amp; Papa Roach Outperform Headliners 




By Craig Lloyd 

U3l g.1 loydS ipFwiamimi n iul di 



The Coliseum held 

a fairly large crowd last 
Monday night when a de- 
cent lineup of rock bands 
came to visit. Buckcherry 
and Avenged Sevenfold 
may have been ihe head- 
line bands for the tour, 
but it was Saving Abel 
and Papa Roach thai left a 
lasting impression. 

Saving Abel was first 
to open the four hour 
rock extravaganza with 
songs such as New Tai- 
too and their most popu- 
lar title Addicted. Lead 
singer lared Weeks has a 
gripping stage presence, 
and even though they're 
a young band, they put on 
a veteran act. Aside from 
their upbeat collection, 
they managed to pull off 
tlieir heart warming track 
18 Days with grace,-which 
led to thousands offans to 
raise there cigarette light- 
ers and cell phones with 
passion. 
, Next to take the stage 
"'WasTapa Roach, who ar- 



guably put on the best 
performance of the night. 
To Be Loved, Forever, and 
Getting Away With Mur- 
der were just some of 
the many head-banging 
tunes that the fans en- 
joyed. The veteran band 
even went old school with 
their 2000 single Last Re- 
sort and debuted new 
songs from their upcom- 
ing album. Metamorpho- 
sis. Such tracks included 
Hollj-wood Whore, which 
was fittingly dedicated to 
Paris Hilton and Britney 
Spears, and Lifeline, in 
which lead singer Jacoby 
Shaddix literally joined 
the crowd and gave high 
fives left and right. 

Unfo rt una tely. 
Avenged Sevenfold had 
to cancel their part of the 
concert at the last minute 
due to illness. No word yet 
on why exactly the band 



canceled right before tliey 
were scheduled to play 
but they did offer half 
price tickets to their Feb. 
19 show in Indianapolis 
for anyone that went to 
the Feb. 16 show. 

Roundingout the night 
was Buckcherry, who sur- 
prisingly did not enter- 
tain as well as I hoped and 
many could agree with 
me. The raspy vocals of 
lead singer Josh Todd were 
drowned out by the rest 
of the band, making him 
hard to hear. On top of 
that, the tambourine that 
Todd was shaking around 
definitely did not help the 
matter. The band also had 
an unsatisfying politi- 
cal slide show playing as 
their backdrop, which got 
me thinking about Green 
Day's fall of fame a few 
years back when the punk 
band became political.

Artist of the Week: 




IPFW sludenls have 
lh(? privilege of sEudying 
under Mrs. Sayaka Ganz 
this semester. Ganz is 
an art practitioner profi- 
cient in the sculpting me- 
dium known as "found 
object". This medium is 
an additive process. First 
she conceives an image 



of what she wants the 
sculpture to look like or 
finds a picture that she 
wants to use as a model. 
She then travels to differ- 
ent thrift stores, gather- 
ing a collection of vari- 
ous objects (hat she will 
use to fabricate her new 
sculpture. 



Ganz holds two de- 
grees; a Bachelor in Fine 
Arts in Printmaking 
from Indiana University 
Bloomington, as well as 
a Masters of Fine ^Vrts in 
3D Studies with a con- 
centration in sculpture 
from BowlingGreen Slate 
University. 

"It took me a long 
time lo figure out what 
I wanted to do." said 
Ganz. Eventually she 
had to choose an empha- 
sis. It turns out that hav- 
ing studied printmaking 
and working ivith a cer- 
tain process that utilized 
scrap metal helped lead 
her to study sculpture. 

While attending lU, 
she met her now hus- 
band, Chris Ganz, Asso- 
ciate Professor of Print- 
making at IPFW. "1 didn't 
think 1 would marry an- 
other artist, but it makes 
sense now," confessed 



The Shrew Has Been Tamed 

Williams Theatre Pulls off Another Spectacular Show 



By Kim Coffey 

m .coHeryeipfwcDmrnun lata 



W^liam Shakespeare's 
The Taming of the Shrew 
has been depicted today 
in numerous pop-culture 
references. This includes, 
but is not limited lo the 
movie 10 Things 1 Hate 
About You and the play 
Kiss me Kate. The plot has 
all the makings of a good 
old fashioned drama. 

Lucentio, (played by 
Edian Bairl is love-struck 
when he first lays eyes on 
the docile Bianca, (Ta- 
betha Brake). However, 
his wishes for courtship 
are shot down when 
Bianca's father, Baptista 
(Jim Clauser), resolves 
that Bianca is not to wed 
until her older sister Kate 
(Jessica Buder) is mar- 
ried first. This would not 
be a problem if it wasn't 
for the fact that Kate is a 



man-hater whose goal 
is lo chase every poten- 
tial suitor away. Bianca's 
other wannabe suitors, 
Gremio and Hortensio 
(Jacob Slone and Chad 
Kennerk), come up v/ith 
a simple solution: pay off 
Pertrucio (Aaron Mann) 
lo woo and marry Kate, 
thus leaving Bianca free 
for the taking. 

The events that follow 
are worthy of any day- 
time soap opera, except 
with much better acting. 
Even the musicians (Kay 
Brown and Edward Renz) 
play distinct roles, as the 
characters both acknowl- 
edge and interact with 
their presence. 

One might be inclined 
to think that Shakespeare

has two to play. Each team could 
also finish 7-11 by winning 
outright. But, IPFW swept each 
team, owning the tie breakers 
and will not be seeded lower than 
seventh with one win this week. 

Fife points out that while he- 
is aware of the situation, he isn't 
focusing solely on it. 

"It is just important that we 
want to play well," Fife said, "And 
They currently sit at seventh with if we do, we will one (win). But we 
Western Illinois a half game back also have our own goals that we 



ivant to take care of." 

No matter what IPFW or 
Western Illinois do, the Mastodons 
are also in the tournament with 
a single Centenary loss. The only 
chance IPFW has of missing the 
tournament is if they lose both 
games this weekend while Western . 
IllinoisbeatslUPUI and Centenary 
somehow sweeps their battle with 
the Dakotas. 

NDSU, Oral Roberts and 
Oakland (likely staying in that 
order) are locked into the 
top three spots. Jockeying for 
position behind them will be 
criticial, especially for the four 
and five spots, to avoid a first 
round meeting \vith any of 
those three teams. 

IPFW can improve their 
position to sixth with a single 
win and two South Dakota State 
losses. Tliey can finish as high as 
fifth writh two wins, at least a split 
by SDSU, two losses by Southern 
Utah and a 17-point win over the 
Thunderbirds on Saturday. 

Five close and very important 
games take place this week. 
Southern Utah visits Oakland on 
Thursday, while Saturday's slate 
is full with SDSU at Centenary, 
Southern at IPFW, lUPUI at 
Western Illinois and NDSU visiting 
Oral Roberts in a game that couldl 
be for the top-seed. 




Women win, stay in control of 
own destiny in League play 



If there was ever a time to win, the 
IPFW women have found it. With the 
end of the regular season looming, 
IPFW upended both Western Illinois 
and lUPUI this past week on the road. 

In Monday's win over lUPUI, 
Chelsey Jackson lef the Mastodons off 
the bench ivith 16 points. Eva Ivanova 
had 15, while Jordan Zuppe and Sarah 
Haluska each added eight points. 

IPFW led by as many as nine points 
early and never trailed while avenging 
an earlier season loss to the laguats. 

The Mastodons defeated Western 
Illinois on Saturday, 78-61. It is 
the second win this year over the 
Westerwinds for IPFW, 

"The kids came out hard and got 
a win that we really needed," Coach 
Chris Paul commented. 

In Saturday's win, Jackson scored 
a career-high 27 points on 11 -of- 14 
shooting to lead IPFW. Zuppe hit five 
three -pointers on her way to 21 points. 
Nanyamka Moore, in hei first starting 



role of the season, and just the 15th 
of her career, scored a season-high 11 
points, while dishing out three assists 
and picking up three steals. 

Even more convoluted than the 
men's side, there are many scenerios 
for the IPFW women to make the 
tournament. 

Fifth through ninth in the current 
standings are seperated by two total 
games going into the final weekend. 
IPFW (6-10 SL) plays bodi UMKC (7-9) 
and Soudiern Utah {5-U). 

if the Mastodons win outright, tliey 
won't have to worry about anyone else, 
making them very much in control of 
their own destiny. However, a victory 
over Southern Utah on Saturday at 
the Coliseum would guarantee IPFW 
a spot, even with a loss to UMKC on 
Monday, 

Based on many events, IPFW could 
end up as high as fifth still with two 
UMKC losses, and one loss ea'ch from 
Western Illinois and Oral Roberts.

Mastodons' match on the brink 

■ Mastodons push #1 Penn State to the edge, defending National Champions respond with closer-than-expected 3-1 victory 



By Dan Vance 

dan.vanceSiptwcommunicator.org 



Standing up for game point on 
Saturday night, the crowd inside the 
" Gates Center displayed a mix of shocl(, 
awe, excitement and pride. 

Here were the upstart Mastodons, 
just one point from taking game two 
off the top team in the nation. An 
attack error by Penn State then sent 
the gym into a frenzy, players and all. 
One would have thought coach Arnie 
Ball's Mastodons just returned to the 
Final Four based on the reaction. 

The game t\vo win in a 3-1 loss to 
Penn State was the pinnacle of a night 
right on the brink of upset. 

"I didn't really have to say anything 
(to get the team molivaied), there 
wasn't any reason to." Bail said. "We 
had a great deal of self confidence 
coming off Friday." 

The Mastodons used career 
higlis from Dartyl Shank (25 kills), 
Phil Peterson (17 kills) and Corey 
Stewart {47 assists) to keep pace, and 
nearly upset t
