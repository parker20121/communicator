1984, a year of transition 



This marlu the final issue of The 
Communicator for IBM, a year of 
Iransitlof) for the newspaper, IPFW and 
Ihe counlry. 

It wan a year of transition for The 
Communicator because itn publisher of 
nil years, John l.ogan. tefl for a position 
In Chicago. Over (he summer, the 
editorial stall had to make plans for this 
paal semester with no idea of who Ihe 
new publisher would be or what that 
person would be like. 

Michael DePreeuw came on board as 
Ihe publisher m mId-AugusI as we were 
planning! Ihe first Issue. He was new to 
hlK lob, but we were able lo put the 
handt&gt;nok Issue together almost on time. 

With Ihe second issue o( Ihe semester, 
Ihe lirsl regular Issue, we changed the 
namcplatc from big-bold black letters to 
Old English. We were lold we regressed 
20 years with Old English, but we sluck 
by our decision. 

IBIM was also a year ol transition for 
IPFW. 

Chnneellor Joseph P Giusti took a 
leave lo assist 10 President John Ryan 
and Purdue President Steven Bcering In 
i:.i!hering information for 

II .nilhurluillon ol Ihe Higher Education 
Ai t ni 1905. The acl will expire Sept. 30, 
i'&lt;H.'&gt; What Glusti's plans are for Ihe 
luture, unly ho seems lo know for sure. 
iiiliiTS, however, don'l expect him lo 
return »s chancellor. 

I'.'tu also marked IPFWs 201h an- 
riiiir&gt;ary. An idea of former Purdue 
iru.kf Alfred W. Ketller, Sr.. IPFW 
Im urown from one building (Ketller 
ll.iil' in Ihe fall of 1964 )□ six major 
LuiltlinRs today Plans ore in the works 



for an animal care facility, a fine arts 
faclllly and possibly a baseball stadium. 

On the sports front, 1364 saw IPFW 
win its fif^t Great Lakes Valley Con- 
ference ctiampionship. Freshmen Sarah 
Yaggy and Manju Usman captured 
individual tennis titles in the GLVC 
loumament in October. In November. 
the women's volleyball team bagged its 
first conference title *tlh a stunning 
three-game sweep oi Lewis, the 
defending champions 

19S4 saw. lor Ihe first time In recent 
memory, more than two people run for 
student txHly president Don Gomcy. a 
senator, beat out Joe Motherwell and 
John Gingrich for the top spot 

Mastodons Invaded IPFW in 13M. The 
exlincl criller thai serves as IPFWs 
mascot was put in a display case in 
Ketller Hall. Students' Government 
started selling stuffed mastodons on a 
trial basis last spring and on a per- 
manent basis this fall. 

On Ihe national scene, 1984 saw the re- 
election of President Ronald Reagan; 
the indictment ot Mayor Winfield 
Moses; the transplant ol the second 
arllficial heart in Indiana native William 
Schroeder; the first woman vice 
presidential candidate by a major parly 
in Geraldine Ferraro; and the Detroit 
Tigers cultimaled one ol Ihe greatest 
seasons ever with a World Series victory 
over the San Diego Padres in five 

or course, these aren't all of the 
signifleanl events ol 19»), but they show 
a year of change and decision. So long 
1984, it's been a pretty good year.
