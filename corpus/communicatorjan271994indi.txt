Investigation into parking proposal continues 



by Ramona Mcgown 
Editor in chief 

According to Linda Woolon, 
Chair o( the University Resources 
Policy Commillec and insinicior 
of English and linguistics, the 
parking proposal has yei lo go 
through the appropriaie channels. 

"At the commillce meeting there 
was a majority rule to pass 
Branson's proposal." said Wooton. 

Vwo cotnmillee members voted 
against ihc proposal, while student 
rcptescniaiivc Joyce Slocks wailed 
for an abstention thai was never 



offered. 

Slocks staled two reasons for 
warning to abstain. 

"Once 1 realized what die com- 
mittee was all about, I felt a con- 
flict of interest because of my 
position at The Communicator. 
Secondly. I wanted some input 
from IPSGA as to their position on 
Ihc parking issue, and I wanted 
to give Raj (student body presi- 
dent, Rajal Suri) a chance to 
a.ssign a student without a con- 
riici of interest to serve on the 
committee." 

After the commillee approved 



the proposal presented by Waller 
Branson, vice chancellor of finan- 
cial affairs, an issue arose as lo 
whether the university commitiec 
was acting within iLs own bylaws. 
In addition there was some dis- 
agreement over whether ihe URPC 
should contact the student govern- 
ment concerning their position on 
the parking proposal. 

Included in the e-mail messages 
were comments from Fred 
Kirchoff, chair and professor of 
Ihe English and linguistics 
department. 

■"The bylaws place parking under 



'nonacadcmic planning' so that, 
e.g. location of lots would be a 
concern of URPC, but not fees. 
The changes we approved were all 
fee-related," said Kirchoff. 

Wooton said that she sent e-mail 
10 all committee members. 
Throughout the e-mail messages 
on Dec 13 and 14. there was dis- 
cussion on the bylaws concerning 
the proposal, the question of 
whether or not student government 
should be contacted, and the offer- 
ing of options as to what action 
should be taken. 

The last e-mail sent by Wooton 



IPSGA President absent 



by Linda Oliver 
Chief Reporter 

Student Goveminent opened their 
meeting with the absence of student 
body president, Rajai Suri, who still 
has yet to register for Spring 
semester classes, 

Student Government Vice 
President of Legislation. Jerry 
Rtcbardson, opened the weekly 
senate meeting by acknowledging 
the Student Senate members Who 
were present. 

Those who attended the meeting 
in Walb 225 were : Michael Heit. 
Vice President of Finance and 
Senate members. Amy Siecnman, 
Deborah Deere, Chris Douse, 
Charles Copeland, Kevin Allen, 
and James Walker. 

Tracy Ruda and Matt Bain are 



no longer Senate members. 

No one knew when Suri woniJ 
return from India, but Richardson 
claimed he truly hopes Suri will 
return very soon, }^e said that if 
Suri didn't reium within a week, 
Richardson himself will take over 
bis position, due to the pressing 
nature of upcoming senate busi- 
ness. 

"In die nent two to three days, we 
hope to know something definitely 
on Rajat's return," sjud Richardson 

Chris Douse mentioned that as 
Suri's fratemity broiher,lhat he i,'^

T Red Cross 
delivers assistance 



by Jo Ann Steinforth 
News Editor 

The Fon Wayne Chapter of The 
American Red Cross sent assis- 
tance 10 California to help with 
earUiquake victims. 

Lois Hess, a registered nurse, 
left Fon Wayne Monday to assist 
earthquake victims who need 
medications and other minor 
assistance, such as repbcing eye- 
glasses, supplying hospital beds 
and rebuilding ramps in houses of 
the disabled, according lo Karen 
Reef, director of public affairs for 
Ihe Red Cross. Hess will be Uiere 
a minimum of three weeks. 

"As service centers become 



open, there will be a possibility 
that more volunteers from Fon 
Wayne will be sent," said Reef. 

As of Monday, the priority for 
earthquake victims is to provide 
food and shelter. 

There are approKimately 3.193 
Red Cross volunteers from aaoss 
the counuy in Los Angeles at diis 
time. 

Fort Wayne is processing wel- 
fare inquiries for Fort Wayne fam- 
ilies with missing family members 
in Los Angeles. 

"There are estimates of 40.000 
families affected by the earth- 
quake in the Los Angeles area," 
add;xl Reef. 



Residents in California try to recover 



by JoAnnSlelnforth 
News Editor 

Southern Califomians are trying 
lo pick up die pieces of their lives 
and homes after last week's major 
earthquake registering 6.6 on the 
Ricbier scale destroyed dieir homes 
and businesses. 

Nonhridge, Catd", was die epicen- 
ter of this earthquake, ll was caused 
by ground movement along a 



buried thrust fault, and has claimed 
47 lives so far. Properly damage 
has been estimated lo reach over 
S30 billion. 

Seismologists are predicting up to 
10.000 aftershocks. 

Last week's quake was located 
approximately 35 mUes west of the 
San Andreas fault, which runs north 
- south and stretches more than 400 
miles from the Salion Sea in the 
south, cast of Los Angeles, lo west 



of downtown San Francisco. 

"It passes Uuough west of Bodega 
Bay. which is 40-50 miles north of 
San Francisco," said Dipak K. 
Chowdhury, professor of 
Geoscienccs. 

"The fault then enters the Pacific 
near Manchester, in northern 
California," added Chowdhury. 

What about the "Big One"? 
Scientists are divided on this sub- 
jecL The 1989 Loma f^eta quake.

south of San Francisco, released 
quite a bit of stress. 

Scientists do not expect another 
major quake in San Francisco for 
another two to three years. 

But some scientists believe last 
week's quake tiasn't released suffi- 
cient energy to prevent the oncom- 
ing Big One, in southern California. 

"Last Monday's earthquake might 
have delayed d)e inevitable big one 
by relieving some stress under- 
ground," added Chowdhury. 

The Midwest also is a major fauh 
area. The New Madrid fault is 
located along the Mississippi River 
Valley- 

This fault runs along northeast 
Arkansas and western Kentucky. 
Although earthquakes are frequent 
in this region, they usually register 
4.0 or less on the Richier scale, 

"We expect a 6.5 or 7.0 in the 
next 35 years on the New Madrid 
fault." said Chowdhury. 

Most faults in the Midwest are not 
active, 

Although plate tectonics don't 
normally get as much attention as 
earthquakes, plate motions general- 
ly cause earthquakes. Gcqihysicisls 
and seismologists study plate tec- 
tonics. 

Both the North and South 
American continents are located on 
plates. There are six to seven pbies 
covering the Earth's surface. 

California straddles two plates. 
The San Andreas fault system is on 
ibe boundary between the 
American plate and the Pacific 
plate. Most of California lies on the 
North American plate and the west- 
ern pan of California, along widi 
Los Angeles, rests on the Pacific 
plate. 

The epicenter of last week's 
quake did not appear to lie on a 
known fault. Many geoscientists 
believe the earthquake took place 
along an undiscovered fault. 

"It is too early to lell yet if a new 
fault has been discovered, more 
data is needed, before we can say 
for sure." said Qiowdhury. 



was on Dec 16. Since student rep- 
resentative Joyce Slocks did not 
have access to e-mail, Wooton 
photocopied all die information 
discussed in e-mail. 

Stocks received the information 
on Dec 19, after the discussion had 
already taken place, Wooton stated 
dial a "time crunch" caused her to 
get the information out to Slocks 
on a later dale. 

After receiving the packet of e- 
mail messages. Slocks expressed 
her disappointment in the fact that 
the committee did not take into 
account that she did not have e- 



mail. 

"I was particularly concerned 
widi the final Dec 16 e-mail nws- 
sagc from Linda Wooion lo Ihc 
rest of Ihc committee, in which she 
Slated that 'she wailed until all 
who wanted lo had the opponuniiy 
to voice their opinions....' I was 
never given the opportunity. 1 
questioned how die students were 
lo be represented in all of this." 

Wooton said that the commitiec 
is open to suggestions as to alter- 
native ideas or plans on the park- 
ing siluadon. 



Offensive odors cause

by Linda Oliver Associate Professor of Fine ArLs 

Chief Reporter Hector Garcia claimed thai the ven- 

Ulation is so poor in die Fine Arts 
building that be once had to open a 
window when the fumes became 
too .strong. 

Kaiter explained that the build- 
ings' ventilation systems were not 
designed for today's capacity and 
needs. 

Dr. Usbcnko said dial if she or 
any of the other Fine Arts staff had 
been consulted before the Fine Arts

The ventilation systems in 
Classroom Medical and Fine Arts 
building arc expelling offensive 
fumes that concern students and 
faculty. 

"I feel concerned because CM 
people became ill from the fumes 
and some students' eyes swelled 
closed," said Audrey A. Ushenko, 
associate professor in the Fine Arts 
department.

ing Ihe summer of 

'93, Kaliei said that be was not 
aware of any recent problems. 

Ushenko admits that the venUla- 
lion has improved since a high ced- 
ing ventilation system was installed 
last summer, but she claims that it 
is still a problem. 

Ushenko said ihat when she is in 
the print making room on the sec-

Kallcr hopes that the first of the 
four phases planned to correct the 
ventilation problem will balance 
Ibe air system when the fan is 
speeded up. 

If Phase One fails, then Phase 
Two, which includes the installa- 
tion of an air handler, will be 
implemented. In Phase Three 
expansions will be made. If it is 
necessary Phase Four will start, 
which involves improving each 
individual room's venliladon.

Phase One of the remodeling of 
the new filtering system in 
Classroom Medical will be com- 
pleted by the end of next week. 

An estimated budget for all 
four phases will be $1.3 million. 
Phase One cost S86.000. 

The new air fdtering system is 
designed to deliver more air into 
the building," said Donald R. 
Katier, director of ihe Physical 
PlanL 

"The ventilation in Classroom 
Medical has had problems with 
die air quality since it was con- 



structed in the late 70s when 
there was an energy crunch." 
^dedKailcr. 

When Phase One is finished, 
lesdng will be run before slaning 
Phase Two. 

"Phase Two will begin in 
approximately one month." said 
Kaiier. 

"The new fdtering system has a 
large air handler (or unit) to take 
care of Ihe entire building and 
will be more efficient in remov- 
ing all dust particles," explained 
Kaiier. 

Shambaugb and Sons were con- 
iracied to remodel the ventilation 
system.

More to sports 
than volleyball 

ll's Uial time of year once more kids; volleyball season. The 
qucstJon this week is, why is H ihai men's volleyball always gets 
more coverage Ihan all of the other sports played at IPFW put 
togciher? 

Granled, the IPFW men's volleyball team is cunenlly ranked 
fourth In the nation. Thai illustrious achievement certainly war- 
rants tnjckloads of press coverage. 

Bui how many times have you seen an IPFW athlete other than 
the members of the men's volleyball team being interviewed by 
the local news media? How many other sporting events receive 
local television coverage? 

For two days In a row this past week articles appeared in the 
Journal Gazelle and the News Senlinel regarding the latest 
development in IPFW men's volleyball 

We have no question whatsoever thai the men's volleyball 
team is deserving of all of the attention it received from the local 
press. Our men's volleyball team Is a shining example of a hard- 
working and dedicated learn whose effort pays big dividends to 
them, the school, and the community, 

However, we also applaud the other hardworking and dedicat- 
ed learns throughout IPFW sports. If our other teams had the 
interest generated loward tliem ihal the IPFW men's volleyball 
learn has, perliaps it would become clear that they, too, have the 
capacity lo shine brightly. What about the IPFAV women's vol- 
leyball Icam, for example? Where is their spotlight? Are they not 
fighting as hard as the men? Don'l they, loo, deserve the support 
of the community? 

The fact is community support can play nearly as large a role 
in building a wiiming team as winning players and winning 
coaches. 

Several other teams at IPFW have done very well recently and 
deserve support for the job thai they did. The women's basket- 
ball team is very young and is currently 13-3. The men's basket- 
ball team won lis championship last year. The women's volley- 
ball team won the Grcallakcs Volleyball Tournament and Ihe 
women's cross country team had Ihe best season in the history of 
IPFW last season. 

One good thing about Ihe volleyball learn getting so much 
press is that it brings in money for all of the other sports. The 
problem Is that if IPFW sports aien|t wliming, then the media 
doesn't want lo cover them. ' 

However, there is no distinction among the teams. One inter- 
esting fact is that even though the volleyball team is ranked 
higher than all of the other teams, there are only four scholar- 
ships being held by the men's volleyball team. The women's vol- 
leyball team has iwice the scholarships. 

When IPFW hosis the men's volleyball championship, it will 
bring in a quarter of a million dollars worth of business into the 
community. The community benefits from IPFW sporting 
events. Fort Wayne National Bank, Pepsi, and Farm Bureau 
Insurance are three companies lhal have been very supportive of 
Ihe athletic department. 

The Communicator commends the IPFW men's volleyball 
team on its outstanding achievemenl. But we also wish to com- 
mend the men's soccer team, the women's volleyball team, both 
the women's and men's basketball teams the cross country 
teams, the baseball team as well as Ihe soflball team. Without 
your contributions, IPFW sports would not be as successful as it 
is today.

Letters to the editor 



Student responds to columns 



Dear Edilort 

This letter is in response to iwo 
related editorials in the last issue, 
one titled "Sharing thoughts with 
Edward" and the otber. "A Dose of 
Douse," 

Perhaps unwillingly, you have 
accurately portrayed the altitude of 
a large portion of society. Equaling 
people and iheir "preciousncss" 
with models of cars puts humans in 
Ihc category of a commodity, 
whose value is dciennined by other 
humans. 

This places the person being eval- 
uated at a distinct disadvantage if 
be or she docs not me«l the require- 
ments of the person judging his or 
her value. 

The person as a commodily might 



be accqjied or rejected by jusi one 
individual as in the case of an 
expccianl mother deciding whether 
or not 10 have an abonion. The per- 
son might be rejected by sociely at 
large if he is homeless or menially 
handicapped, or id be bas become 
"loo old to be useful." Maybe the 
person is simply an "undesirable" 
who is just taking up our space 
(which happens to be more precious 
than he is) and using up our valu- 
able resources. 

Thankfully, humans do no! derive 
their iruc value from other people, 
but from Iheir Creator, who assigns 
the same value to each individual. 

Yes, everyone is created equal; 
from die wealthy industrialist to ihe 
impoverished homeless woman. 
From Ihe star athlete to the Down's 



Syndrome baby. 

When one person is stronger, 
smarter or wealthier than anolher. 
Ihen thai person might be perceived 
as having more worth than those 
less foriunaic, or those who are 
weak, ill deemed loo dcpenilcni on 
odiers or a voiceless prebom child. 

However, this false assignment of 
human worth is based on the flawed 
sysicm of humanistic values.. ..peo- 
ple acting as lilUe gods presuming 
power over die lives of those who 
haven't measured up to their stan- 
dards. These standards vary from 
era lo era, from sociely to society 
and from person lo person within 
diat sociely. 

But the highest standard never 
changes. It never has and never 
will. Each human life is precious, 



Snyder shows softer side 



Dear Editor: 

Reading Jeff Brunson's article 
on political correctness which 
appeared in last week's 
Communicator, it occurred to 
me that this censorial revision of 
language is only emblematic of 
the metonymy diat has sterilized 
not only our language but our 
emotions, as well. 

In this new age sociely of 
anhedonic androgyny, love is no 
longer a word or emotion of die 
sublime but, instead has become 
to be seen as some archaic 
notion of sublimation and 
viewed as synonymous with 
such base and negativistic char- 
acteristics as oppression, repres- 
sion, restriction, and so forth. 
Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend 
(whoops, I mean "significant 
other") that you love him or her 
and they will, if not run the 
other way as fast as possible, 
look upon you as some misguid- 
ed and misanthropic lomanUc lo 
be pitied, at best, or analyzed, at 
worst. All of what once were 
synonyms for love: passion, 
desire, affection, devotion, 
attachment, endearment, adora- 
don. and so on, have been trans- 



mutated into words and feelings 
of debilitation, emasculation, 
impotence, and deterioration. 

I have personally experienced 
this phenomena myself when, by 
saying those three, once beauti- 
ful but now seemingly repulsive, 
words, "I Love You," I not only 
watched a wonderful relation- 
ship deteriorate, but was subject- 
ed to its death throes through 
endless hours, days, and weeks 
of anarchic emodonal distress as 
love was analyzed, examined, 
investigated, dissected and treat- 
ed as some maladaptive behav- 
ior to be expunged from the psy- 
che. The words of love earlier 
mentioned, the desire for com- 
mitment, and die expressed hope 
of a shared future were each 
seen as signifiers for restricdon, 
dependence, imprisonmeni, or 
confinement. Spoken desires 
were interpreted as demands, 
and wishes were somehow 
viewed as ultimatums. Passion 
was interpreted as obsession and 
obsession as possession. Love. 
rather than tended as an exotic 
bed of flowers, was now to be 
seen as an overgrown garden to 
be weeded, smothering life 



where it once had given life 
breath. 

You see, caught in the trap of 
this enlightenment age of non- 
committance which pledges its 
allegiance lo a flag of icono- 
clasm, I, like so many others 
today, waited too long to speak 
those words of love. When I 
professed them, they were mis- 
trusted. As a result, by censoring 
the language of love, love itself 
became censored leaving as its 
heirs a mutant prodigy in which 
terms of endearment, truth, and 
honesty were now seen as acts 
of manipulation, dishonesty, and 
deception. 

Where has love gone? What 
has become of that noblest of all 
passions? Why are we so in fear 
of Shakespeare's "bright particu- 
lar star?" It seems that the "red, 
red rose of Burns" love has 
become the "sick rose" of 
Blake's, and Shelley's "all love 
is sweet" has become 
Swinburnes's "bitter a thing i( 
is." I for one hopeless romantic 
that I may be will continue to 
hope lo love and hope to be 
loved regardless how un-enlight- 
ened or un-politically correct 



A voice from Generation X 



By Edward Granzella Jr. 
Staff Columnist 

PSYCH 120 wasn't the fust fresh- 
man course I'd taken, but it was the 
fu'si one in which ihe majority of 
ihe students saw no value in what 
was being taught. That was readily 
apparent by the class attendance on 
non-test days, 

I was led lo understand thai the 
one psychology instructor you 
didn't want was Dr. Gerow. Since 
Gerow wrote dje textbook, he actu- 
ally expected you lo read it. So, lasi 
semester ! was in one of Dr. Craig 
Hills classes, I&gt;r. Hill was new lo 
the IPFW family, so he was prot&gt;a- 
bly on some son of fBobaiion. That 
may have been a bonus for students 
in our class, because he could ill- 
afford 10 upset a lot of die students 
and receive a bunch of thumbs 
down on his reviews. 

Dr, Hill was very agreeable - too 
agreeable, most of tbe time. 



Aldiough he encouraged class dis- 
cussion, rarely would he gel much 
response from those few students 
who were still awake. When he got 
response he would usually agree 
with the student no matter how 
inelevani or inane the comment 
was. I guess he wanted to encour- 
age odier siudcnis to coniribuie, 

I remember two comments dis- 
lincdy. One was about a "friend" 
who used marijuana regularly but 
exhibited no menial deficiencies. 
Raiher. he was quite intelligent. 
The student asked if pot might be a 
spur to mental processes? I guess he 
wanted to know if there were such a 
thing as a "sman pill" hq)ing that it 
might have an added benefit of 
being hallucinogenic or narcotic. 
Dr, Hill's response was that said 
smoking weed does not make you 
smarter, but it has been used in 
some medical treannenis. 

The second comment came during 
a discussion about twins, A girl said 



thai she had a great aunt on her 
mother's side who was rushed lo 
the hospital with stomach pains. 
They pumped out her stomach lo 
discover a tiny human skull and 
bones. Apparently, the aunt bad 
eaten her own twin while still in the 
womb. Dr. Hill didn't respond with 
any examples of similar occur- 
rences for some reason. I suspect 
Oils might have been the fu^i time 
he had beard of prenatal cannibal- 
ism. It's quite common, actually. 

The main cause for conccm was 
ihe grading system. Originally we 
were informed that tbe exams 
would consist of 50 multiple choice 
quesuons graded on die standard 
90-80-70 scale. The iwisl. as 1 
learned later, was thai if the majori- 
ty of the class missed a question 
everyone would get credit for it 
whedier diey missed it or not. After 
the first couple of exams, a numtier 
of the students who actually came 
to class and studied had averages 



regardless of tbe impotent uitcrings 
of Hide human gods aticmpiing lo 
shape sociely lo dieir own wills. 

To Mr. Douse: you ua- correct in 
your assertion that abortion would 
become profitable as it relates to 
the harvesting of tissues, organs 
and odier components of a prebom 
human being. In fact, abortion is 
already a highly profitable enter- 
prise which directly benefits from 
die sad devaluation of human life. 

Yes, in our sociely, one innocent 
life is snuffed out for the conve- 
nience of anolher and, in die ver- 
nacular of the "car" editorial, '74 
Vegas arc related lo the junk heap

that may be as to be odierwise is 
to accept sterility and banenness 
raiher than risk pain, and 
embrace anesthesia as a subsU- 
hiie for life. 

The nineteenth century writer, 
George Sand said: "There is. 
only one true happiness in life, 
to love and be loved, "Those 
should not be words of embar- 
rassment or anathema, but words 
of joy something this world is in 
short supply of today, and some- 
thing I may have lost while 
keeping step to the march of 
political correctness. 

So, lo each of you I say, do not 
make die mistake thai I did. Do 
not be afraid to love or be loved. 
Sometimes one must throw cau- 
tion 10 the wind and be swept 
along by the passion of love 
without suspicion, without rea- 
son, and without logic, or else 
that passion and that love will be 
swept away as so many dried 
and faded leaves bearini; liiile 
reminder to the beauty and 
vibrancy of what once was. The 
pain of loneliness is so very 
much greater ihan the pain of 
love.

significandy greater than 100%. I 
guess ibal's an A triple plus widi a 
cherry on top. Students who bad 
sporadic attendance and readily 
admitted dieir lack of effon made 
B's and C's much to their delight. It 
almost seemed thai the students 
who did lilde were positively rein- 
forced and those who did the things 
that good students do were stripped 
of a source of motivation to main- 
tain proper study babiu. 

The psychology department may 
want 10 review its grading system, 
ll might be beuer in die long run to 
flunk a quarter of the class and 
regain some credibility for their 
department and IPFW. One must 
admit, diough. thai lakes die pres-

Q- 
LU 
CC 




by Sarah Miller 
Managing Editor 

I'm back and it's almost over. 
After being stuck al faome Tor the 
last week now. unable lo go to 
school, work, or live a life. I'm 
very glad lo be back lo work. The 
water pitcher was my bcsi friend 
and my medicine came in a close 
second Dui I'm jusi like everyone 
else - well almosc. I bad bronchitis, 
I look showers three times a day in 
hc^ thai the sleam would help me 
breathe. But like I said, I'm no) (he 
only one suffering. 

The flu has been reported in 42 
stales and is widespread in Florida, 
Maine, and Oregon. Parts of a 
dozen other stales arc also rampant 
with (he virus, according lo the 
national Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. 

Researchers project that 
107,630,000 people - 43 percent of 
the United Staujs population - have 
flu symptoms righl now. Among 
the mosi common complaints: 
cough and congestion. 

Ycl the main question bothering 
most of tliusc struck with the virus 
is, "Why did it happen to me?" I 
think it's quilc easy to explain, real- 
ly. If you're like the rest of tbe 
United Stales, more than likely you 
spent the holidays with family and 
friends. You shared laughter, you 
shared stories, you shared prcwnts 
and you shared germs. Let's face il. 
you probably got more than you 
asked for during this season of 
sharing. And now that the feslivi- 
lies are over, you are back safe at 
home ■ and in bed. You have a 
headache, a body ache, pains, 
sweats, chills, a sore throat and 
some of us lucky folks have a 
queasy stomach. Welcome to the 
nu, 1994. 

Here's the bad news. Tbe flu 
strikes 24-48 hours after exposure 
to the vinis. And when ii hits you. il 
can knock you flat So chances arc. 
if you picked up the virus during 
Christmas, you weren't doing much 
celebrating over New Years. It 
starts all of a sudden. Most of the 



time you are fechng well, and (hen 
suddenly your bead aches, your 
muKles hun. you feel miserable. 
Some people even have coughing 
and respiratory symploms. You feel 
hke you're going lo die and by the 
time it's over, you thought you did. 

Bui there is good news ■ son of. 
AU of ihose who got flu shoLs earli- 
er in the season should be protect- 
ed, says CDC epidemiologist 
Lawerence Schonbcrger. "We got 
the right antigens inlo the vaccine 
this year." It's nothing but a guess- 
ing game, "For ibis year, we 
guessed the Beijing. We guessed il 
right" 

Let me explain. Type A (Beijing) 
accounts for more than 99 percent 
of this year's illness. Last year il 
was Type B. Here's the difference: 
when Type B is more dominant, 
more schools are involved. It hits 
children and young adults mosQy. 
Unlike this season, when il is 
Type A that is the problem. This 
affccu all age groups, including 
older people. 

The scientists who make the pre- 
dictions and monitor the flu inler- 
nationaily are now in the process of 
looking into ncni year's vaccine. 
Since pharmaceutical companies 
make 50 million doses, it has to be 
done early. By the end of February 
ihcy will have made all of the deci- 
sions. "It's not always easy and 
predictable. Obviously, the closer 
we are lo being accurate, the more 
protection you have," Schonbcrger 
says.

Q: 



Do you think that IPFW's athletic center 
consists of more than just the men's 
volleyball team? 



Lynne Peppier A 
Sophomore M 

'■ I ihink thai dennilely 
there is more to the 
Athletic Center, but we 
tend to hear more about 
the Volleyball team. Why 
is that? I ihink each team 
should be equally publi- 
cized." 



Fabricio.Montano

"Yes TTie center provides 
exercise facilities like a 
gym and laquetball courts,

Angle Slyford

Aunt Louise counsels 
single E &amp; T student 




Dear Aunt 
LouLm, 

I am sur- 
prised thai all 
of these girls 
arc writing 
you with mzi) 
prublffns, i.e. 
not having 
one. They 
sure aren't 
ailcnding any 
of the classes 
I am in. (Pingcr-Iickin' good. 
Confused, clc) 

] am a junior engineering sludcni 
who has been involved in many 
activities around campus. I work 
out at the Athletic Center dally. 
Except for a select few, most of the 
girls 1 have met won't give me the 
lime of day. Maybe it's because 
ihey sec I wear a watch. 

The Engineering and Technology 
building is about 99% male. And 
the "two orlhree" women I've seen 
are either manied or engaged. So 
the ncul time someone writes lo you 
about not having a man, tell them lo 
spend time in the E&amp;T lounge. 

Signed, 
Not Ugly, but Lost 

Dear Nat Ugly, but Lost, 

Well, sonny, sounds like your 
problem is that you are not lo 
appcalin" to Ihc young gals on 
campus. And thai can be a problem, 
especially if you want somebody to 
love you for who you arc. 

I don't think your problem is the 
fact thai you can lell lime. You 
probably jusi don'l approach the 
women you meet in a manner that is 
acceptable lo ihem or ibey jusI 
don't find you aiiractive. You'll 
have that. But it's like my mama 
used lo always lell me, "Louise, 
there is a someone for everyone on 
this planet" 

And of course she was right 
because I met my ol' cabbage patch 
of a husband. EX}rcus, wbo was not 
loo appealing to most women 
either. But 1 just couldn't gel over 
his red hair and freckles. 'Course 
we were young back then, loo. 

So, dear, your soul mate is out 
there, just keep on looking. You'll 
Hnd someone pieity soon. 

And gals- lake a gander of the 
E&amp;T building, because it sounds to 
your auntie like maybe you all are 
looking for love in all the wrong 
places. 

Your loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

I can't believe the way things are 
going for me. I have so many won- 
derful things in my life and 1 don't 
know why, 1 have a great relation- 
ship with my boyfriend, excellent 
grades, great job, and a wonderful 
family life. It seems like everything 
is going my way. but I have this 
fear that something is going to go 
wrong. And 1 am afraid 1 won't 
know how to handle iL 

Since i-ely, 
Too Good To Be True 

Dear To Good To Be True, 

Look, my little rosebud, things are 
going well for you because the good 



Lord .^cems to want things lo go 
that way. So, don't worry about ii. 
If I were you, I would enjoy all the 
good limes as much as possible, 
because when things go bad, ihey 
go bad. You will wish that those 
good times were back. Plus, we all 
need lo remember that lomoiiow is 
not promise as my mama would 



Your loving Aunt Louise 



say. 



Dear Aunt Loube, 

Aic you a real person? I sure hope 
you are because I have a real prob- 
lem, 

I have lived in Fori Wayne all of 
my life and we have always been 
sort of poor. I thought once I got 
out of high school Ihal things would 
be different, and thai people 
wouldn't look at clothes and sluff. 
But that doesn't seem lo be so. 

Do you think that Fori Wayne and 
especially our campus is class-con- 
scious, and if you do, do you think 
other places are just as bad? 

I know I shouldn't feel inferior, 
but 1 do. Is there any way to stop 
having Uicsc feelings? 

Thank you for responding to my 
questions, Aunt Louise. 

Signed 
Me Low 

Dear Me Low, 

Honey, you need to gel your face 
inio place, gel back in the race, and 
simply feel wonderful about your- 
self. You have no reason lo be 
down. 

Yes, 1 do believe that Fort Wayne 
and IPFW is a class-conscious 
place. Turnip lop, you're going to 
have thai. You are always going to 
come inio contact with people of 
different classes. The thing you 
need to do is realize Itiat the socio- 
economic class a person has doesn't 
necessary bring them happiness. 

1 have a cousin named Edna who 
was married lo a rich businessman. 
Ob, yes, and be had so many affairs 
you could barely count them on 
both of your hands. Edna was upset 
about his infidelity but loved the 
money. So, she stayed with him in 
hopes that be would die first Didn't 
happen thai way at all. Nope, he 
divorced her and she's in the poor 
house jusi like everyone else. 

So, what you need to do is realize 
that right now you may not have as 
many maieriaJ things as other peo- 
ple, but you do have self-respect, 
and thai should give you self-confi- 
dence. When you have those things, 
you are in a class all by yourself. 

Your loving Aunt Louise

A. It is absolutely 
impossible to get AIDS by 
donating blood. All 
needles, tubing, and 
conlainers used by blood 
donation centers are 
sterile, used only once, 
and then destroyed. So, 
there is no chance of

Students eligible to enter 
national design contest 



Indianapolis, IN, — A national 
student design contest molivaies 
future engineers to practically 
apply knowledge lo an increasingly 
popular and versatile altemalive 
technology Tor industrial actuators 
and vibration isolators. 

The second annual Student 
Innovators Design Contest, spon- 
sored by Firestone Industrial 
Products, rewards first place stu- 
dent designers with S2000. In addi- 
tion, the winning school receives 
$1000 lo be used as grant or schol- 
arship money for a deserving engi- 
neering studenl. Second place win- 
ners receive SIOOO and the third 
place award is S500. 

In October, four Indianapolis-area 
mechanical engineering students 
from lUPUl Purdue School of 
Engineering and Technology were 
named first place winners in 
Firestone Industrial Products' 
1992-93 Student Innovators I&gt;esign 
ContcsU 

"We continue to be amazed with 
the quality of entries wc receive 
each year. Firestone encourages all 
engineering students to enter the 
1993-94 contest currently in 
progress," said Don Foulke, man- 
ager, distributor sales. 

The team of William Smither, 
Matt Shade, Todd Reese and Curt 
Brandl cooperated to design a resi- 
dential elevator for the physically 
challenged and elderly using the 
Firestone Air actuator as the lifting 
device. The winning students were 
given the option of entering the 
contest as part of a group project in 
a senior design class. 

"I wanted to find projects that 
would challenge students and give 
ihem an opportunity to compete 
and gain exposure on a national 
level," said Dr. Siva Chittajallu, 
assistant professor of mecbanical 
engineering at lUPUI Purdue 
School of Engineering and 
Technology. 

"We chose to do this project 
because allowed us the most flexi- 
bility. We wanted to use our own 
creativity and innovative ideas," 
said Shade. "I thought it was quite 
interesting — the amount of force 
you get for the size of the air 
spring." said Brandl. 

The second place winner was Ed 
Staehlc, a student from Temple 
University who designed a pinch- 
ing and lifting device for heavy 
objects. 

The mechanical engineering 
design team of Mark Whittemore, 
Steve Horseman. Brad Roach, and 
Ben Slaves from lUPUI Purdue 
School of Engineering and 
Technology placed third with a 
portable bath lift designed for the 

physically challenged. 



Firestone Industrial Products, a 
division of Bridgestonc/Fircslone 
Inc., manufactures innatable rubber 
and fabric air springs which are 
commonly applied in truck, trailer, 
and bus suspensions. An additional 
field of use for these devices is for 
industrial pneumatic actuators and 
vibration isolators. 

Entry deadline for die 1993-94 
Student Innovators Design Contest 
is June 1, 1994. For more informa- 
tion or an official entry kit for the 
1993-1994 contest, call Paul

the parking situation? 

1 think it's disgusting that the 
University Resources Policy 
Committee has the nerve to try 
and pass something without 
addressing the students first. 

Just who do they think they are? 

I'll teU you one thing, though. I 
ain't even worried about it 
because what comes around goes 
around, right (girlfriend)? 

Now. I ain't one to gossip, but 1 
hear diat a certain professor over 
in the English Department has 
acquired a special gift of outlining 
The Communicator with a high- 
tighler. 

1 m't gonna even touch it I do 
have one question. When did 
English professors become jour- 
nalism experts? 

Well, let's see what else can we 
talk about or shall 1 say who. 

I think it is quite odd that our 
student body president has not 
returned from India. Hopefully, 
Raj will make a graceful return 
back to IPFW as soon as possible. 

I mean it. What would wc do if 
Raj didn't return? 

Well, as the Indiana-Purdue 
Student Government Association 
Constitution states that die presi- 
dent of Senate would fill in, too 
bad that's Jerry Richardson. 

Of course if Jerry-boy becomes 
student body president, I am sure 
he will continue to maint^un a pos- 



itive relationship with The 
Communicator, like the one we 
have now. wouldn't you, Jerr&gt;'? 

I mean it. 

Jerry was so cooperative during 
Elbengaie. 

Why Jerry is also a "former" 
staff member of the paper. I am 
almost sure he wouldn't want to 
sec any subscription money cut 
from the place that allowed him to 
develop his journalistic talents? 

Why would anyone want to even 
think of cutting subscription 
money from The Communicator? 

Why one of his closest friends is 
a former editor in chief. I am 
almost positively sure that work- 
ing on the paper was a learning 
experience for him and bis for 
mer" editor in chief, right'' 

I hope so. 

So. Jerry, if you do take o&gt;er the 
reigns, I wish you the best of lutk 

Speaking of reigns, I heard out 
side of the library some student 
official (the one next in line for 
the student body president) brag 
about how he was going to be 
named emperor this coming 
Monday. 

Talk about a big head. 

Oh, by the way, I really didn t 
think it was right for certain pu) 
pie lo plan an attempt to impeach 
the Student Activities Board 
President at the last S.A.B. meet- 
ing. Did we chicken out, boys? 

Now, if anybody has any other 
'sip, just let me know, alright? 

And remember, you didn't hear 
it from me. but , , .

"Whether or not he (Michael 
Jordan} Is any good really 
doesn't mailer as long as he 
can Jill a stadium." 

Tlic aitisiry played oul on ihc 
toiiru, in Uic fields and in all are- 
nas of professional alhlelics leave 
crowds ailonished and panting for 
more. At limes itic players really 
don'l seem lo be players bul beauty 
Itself in motion. Two components 
sustain professional sports, money 
nnd as last year's NBA Reebok 
comincrcials said "The Love of the 
game." 

Team owners and managers con- 
liniic lo support pnafcssional athlet- 
ics because they continue lo fill 
Ihcir pockets bul regardless to what 
pessimists lell us. this sports fan for 
one icfusas to believe thai athletes 
nrc just in ilic game for the money, 

l.(Bl week; former Chicago Bull's 
supersutf Michael Jordan received 
Ihc Associated Press's Male 
Aihlctc of the Year for the third 
vonsecuiivc year. Jordan is the only 
Uiree-limc winner of die award. 
I^ven in retirement. Michael Jordan 
icinains the most recognized alblctc 
til Ihc world. Many have speculated 
;iboul whelher or not Jordan really 
inieiids lo play major league base- 
l&gt;all and if ihe While Sox will 
accept him if he is serious. Who 
wouldn't? 

Despite our admiration for tbe 
incredible diings professional ath- 
letes have done and continue to do, 
professional sporLs are a business 
und Bulls and White Sox owner 
lerry Rcinsdorf is very much aware 
111 tliui fuel. 

(jivcn the opportunity, practically 
any baseball team in tbe world 
would sign Jordan in a New York 
ininuic because Michael Jordan has 



fans, millions of ihan Whether or 
not be i^ any good really docsn'i 
maiter as long as be can fill a stadi- 
um. Michael Jordan can make il 
into Ihc pros because he is a pro 
and because people realize that bis 
lalenis arc rare Thai is why 
Chicago Stadium has had hundreds 
of consecutive sell-outs and why 
team owners from basketball lo 
hockey would love to have him on 
their team. 

Though Michael Jordan has nui 
played baseball since be was m 
high school his superior athlciic 
qualities on the basketball court 
may very well transfer onto thi: 
baseball diamond. Jordan's speed, 
agility and quick reflexes are capa- 
ble of helping him in practically 
any sporl imaginable. I for one 
would not be suprised if he was 
even belter lhan a fair baseball 
player. 

In light of the fact that tbe only 
ties Michael Jordan has bad with 
baseball in receni years were chari- 
ly events, stricUy for fun if there is 
such a thing with someone as com- 
petitive as Michael Jordan, it is no 
wonder thai people speculate about 
his intentions. 

Is Michael Jordan in it (baseball) 
for die money? He probably is not 
Although human nature dictate^ 
that when presented with a good 
diing wc have a tendency to want 
more, from Uiis Bulls fan's stand- 
point, he is stricdy in il for the chal- 
lenge, for the love of the physical 
challenge. 

During bis retirement announce- 
ment Jordan said he did not have 
anydiing else lo prove in the game 
of basketball. Apparently, he 
has discovered a new obstacle to 
try to overcome. 

I make Michael Jordan my focal 
points because he is well recog- 
nized and because I LOVE the 
Bulls and for eight years he was an 
extremely importani if not vital pan 
of Ihe team, bul in every area of 
professional athletics you will find 
a star that has shined bright despite 
debilitating injuries and contract 
disputes. 

Look to baseball and you see Bo 
Jackson; to track and field and you 
sec Carl Lewis; lo football and you 
see Joe Montana, tbe list goes on 
and on. These athletes sacrifice 
Iheir bodies daily for our pleasure, 
our adulation, their hunger for a 
challenge and ultimately for the 
love they have for the game.
