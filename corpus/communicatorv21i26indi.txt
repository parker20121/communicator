Quote of the week 



Our goal for Earth Day has been to disseminate 
information and give people facts, so that they can 
make intelligent choices. We feel that if people know 
what the facts are about ozone depletion, acid rain, 
species depletion, etc., then they won't be so tempted 
to believe the hysteria." — Janie Fink 
— IPFW biology student
