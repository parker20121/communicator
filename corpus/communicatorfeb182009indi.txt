Magic 8 Ball 

Is There a Casino in the Midst? 



By Kelly McLendon 

kelly.mdendoneijifmoniitiunicalor! 



Fort Wayne may m may not 
have a casino in the near 
future. The uncertainty of 
this project is due to diligent plan- 
ning and assessment, not the on- 
slaught of a torn economy. Instead 
of jumping on the illustrious band 



wagon and giving an immediate, di- 
rect answer, Mayor Tom Henry has 
decided to thoroughly assess the 
City's options before commenting 
publicly on the hnal decision: 

The main reason why the City 
believes it would be a good idea has 
to do with the terms of the econo- 
my. When the federal government is 
in shambles, obviously smaller cit- 
ies will be affected as well. The City 



thinks that a casino or other gam- 
ing entity will help give Fort Wayne 
more money in the challenging 
times ahead. 

There are a few aspects of the 
project left to be considered, how- 
ever. There is already a casino about 
an hour and a half away, in Ander- 
son; called Hoosier Park Having 
two casinos within close proximity 
of each other may cause revenue 



problems for both. 
Having a casino downtown would 
also be a major detractor for the 
image of the city of Fort Wayne. As 
a "City of Churches" and Best Life 
Magazine's "one of the best places 
in the country to raise a family," Fort 
Wayne might lose both tides if a ca- 
sino came to town.

Summit City Grand Resort &amp; Casino Holdings Corp. 
has an interest in this project. The group has plans for 
a downtown casino, resort and water park. 

Two groups have been asked by the city to con- 
duct a market analysis, to see if citizens of Fort Wayne 
would approve of a casino. Third House Advocacy 
Group LLC, based out of Indianapolis, as well as IP- 
FWs own Community Research Institute, have been 
asked to assess the effects building a gambling facility 
would have on the community. No results from the 
surveys or polls have been released yet. 

Mayor Henry visited the IPFW campus last week 
and discussed Harrison Square, as well as the future of 
gambling in downtown Fort Wayne. He talked about 
making downtown "a point of destination," while also 
commenting that many projects will go "on the back- 
burner" through the recession. About the recession, 
Henry said the officials he has talked to are estimat- 



Wasting Precious Resources, 

IPFW Paper 

"You might only throw away a few 

projects with typos per semester, 

but think about how many other 

students on campus are thinking the 

same thoughts." 



Rising tuition costs have students bending ■ 
backwards trying to make ends meet, but what is 
IPFW doing to stimulate our bank accounts growth? 

Recent research conducted by a group of students 
doing a project for their communication class have 
shown that much of IPFW has an incredibly large 
amount of paper waste. Though the unlimited 
printing does help some students get their work done 
well, other students are using paper in vain. 

"The most hands on bit of research we did was 
going through the recycle bin," said Nick Darrah, a 
student and part of the group conducting research 
concerning the paper waste. "When we counted [the 
paper in aj recycle bin and saw the ridiculous waste 
diat the students were contributing to, like Myspace 
comments or photo-copied notebook paper. I 
realized that the problem was larger than I thought. 
I also found two 500-600 page full slide power point 
presentations that, ironically, were on the benefits of 
clean energy. " 

These are just a few examples of the things found 
in recycling bins all around campus that have been 
wasted. But what can IPFW and students do to lessen 
the strain on finance, and for those concerned, the 
green aspect. 

What students do not realize is the amount of 
paper that builds up in the bins. You might only throw 
away a few projects with typos per semester, but 
think about how many other students on campus are 
thinking the same thoughts. Even though recycling is 
better than tossing your projects on the trash, it is still 
a waste of money. 

Schools such as Purdue and Indiana University 
have implemented a way to make students think twice 
before printing their Myspace comments, preventing 
the waste and unnecessary use of precious trees as 
paper.

ing the bad economic times will last about another 
18 months. 

The Mayor also said that Harrison Square has 
produced many jobs, now for construction workers 
and later for hospitality employment. Having the 
proposed casino would create about 1,500 jobs. As 
the Mayor discussed the future for employment in 
the City, he said, "we have a lot of challenges in Fort 
Wayne.. .the economy is not particularly good for 
young grads." He joked that he does not envy recent 
grads and spoke of how when he was starting out of 
school, the country was only in a minor recession, 
whereas now, the state of affairs is much larger. 
Once the results of die community surveys are re- 
leased, citizens may have a concrete idea about where 
this project is going. In the meantime, stay tuned to 
the City of Fort Wayne website for more details on the 
Harrison Square project.

Financial aid alert: FAFSA deadline approaching 

FAFSA important for those wanting consideration for possible state grants 



By Katy Anderson 

Kathryn. Anderson 
Q i p Iwco mmu n i ca lor g rg 

It may be hard to be- 
lieve, but it is time to start 
planningfor financial aid 
for the 2009-2010 school 
year. 

It is of particular con- 
cern for Indiana resi- 
dents wanting consider- 
ation for possible grants 
from the state of Indiana. 
In order to determine 
eligibility for state assis- 
tance, the Free Applica- 
tion for Federal Student 
Aid (FAFSA) should be 
filed no later than March 
1,2009. 

The Federal Depart- 
ment of Education will 



forward necessary data 
to the State for those 
applications filed and 
accepted by March 10, 
2009 (ihe Indiana dead- 
line). Applications filed 
after the Indiana dead- 
line will still be eligible 
for federal assistance 
determination. 

Information needed 
to complete FAFSA is 
based on 2008 income 
lax return records. If 
you have not completed 
your federal income tax 
return, do so as soon as 
possible, and urge your 
parent or guardian to do 
likewise. Those students 
defined as dependents, 
per FAFSA guidelines, 
need to have parents 
collect and provide in- 



come information as well. 
Further information 
pertaining to FAFSA, and 
submission of your appli- 
cation may be acquired 
via the web at www.FAF- 
SA.ed.gov. Be sure to go to 



tier Hall, and the staff is 
available from 8:00 a.m. 
to 6:00 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday, and 
from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 
p.m. on Friday's. The 
IPFW website is also an 



"All students should consider filing for 

financial assistance, regardless of their 

current economic status." 



this website, as there aie 
certain FAFSA sites that 
will "assist" you for a fee. 
Do not be misled. The ap- 
plication process is free 
and user-friendly if one 
follows instructions post- 
ed on the above website. 

IPFW's Financial Aid 
Office is located in Ket- 



excellent option for ad- 
ditional financial re- 
sources. In addition to 
providing links to outside 
sources of aid, campus 
scholarships are posted 
according to need, class 
standing, academic con- 
centration and various 
other considerations. 



Please note that many 
scholarship applications 
require riling by March 
1st. For a "wealth" of in- 
formation, seek out www. 
ipfw.edu/financial. 

All students should 
consider filing for finan- 
cial assistance, regard- 
less of their current eco- 
nomic status. 

Many outside foun- 
dations and organiza- 
tions will request you 
submit FAFSA documen- 
tation should you desire 
grants or assistance, and 
disqualification should 
not be due to student 
procrastination and neg- 
ligence. 

Furthermore, in these 
economically unstable 
times, a family can not 



be certain that a change 
in financial status looms 
on the horizon. Many 
individuals do not want 
to assume debt via stu- 
dent loans. Despite the 
fact a student and his or 
her family may have the 
resources now to pay 
for college, a change in 
income due to unem- 
ployment or unexpected 
hardship will make the 
availability of student 
loans a good safety net 
should the need arise. 
Interest rates are low, 
and a student has up to 
ten years to pay off debt 
after graduation. 

Dig out those pay- 
stubs and get it done! 
Time is money. 




aD l "Have you switched to 

4 DIGITAL?" 



As you might have noticed when you woke up Tuesday morning, 
hundreds of television stations switched to digital signals. 
That means the millions of Americans with analog TVs may see 
only snow on their favorite channels until they take action. Almost 500 
stations said they intended to switch to digital broadcasts, despite a recent' 



Congressional vote to delay the transition until June 12. The legislation 
allowed TV stations to decide when to make the switch, and hundreds arc 
choosing to do it right away. This partial switch has added confusion loan 
already botched conversion program. 

President Obama asked for a delay last year prior to stepping into the 
oval office. As the official transition date, Feb. 17, approached, many 
feared that the US was not ready for the transition to digital television 
(DTV). due to problems with a federal program to distribute vouchers 
for DTV converter boxes. 

To receive the new digital signals, analog TV owners must buy 
the DTV converter box, sign up for a cable or satellite service, or buy 
a new TV with a built-in digital tuner. The government was offering 
$40 vouchers to lower the cost of the converter boxes, but the program 
ran out of funds in early January. While the government's DTV website 
(drv2009.gov) is still accepting coupon requests, applicants are placed 
on a waiting list, which currently has more than 3.7 million households 
waiting in line. An additional budget for this voucher program is a part 
of the financial stimulus plan.

Obama pushes economic 
stimulus plan in Indiana 



ByKATRINALOH 



When Presidem 

Barack Obama visited 
Elkhart as a candidate 
six months ago, the city's 
unemployment rate was 
9.3 percent. 

When President 

Obama returned to 
Elkhart fast Monday, the 
rate had soared to 15.3 
percent since his last 
visit- among the nation's 
highest. 

Elkhart, which was 
once home to the boom- 
ing RV industry, now 
represents the decline of 
U.S. manufacturing. 

Obama was met with 
overwhelming applause 
and cheers as he entered 
the Concord High School 
gymnasium. 

In his first trip outside 
Washington, D.C. since 
his inauguration, Obama 
appealed for public sup- 
port of the proposed 
$827 billion economic 
stimulus bill that is cur- 
rendy being debated in 
the U.S. Senate. 

Failure to pass the bill 
could lead to an even 
bigger downturn, Obama 
said. 

"The situation we face 
could not be more seri- 
ous," Obama said. "We 
have inherited an eco- 
nomic crisis as deep and 
as dire as any since the 
Great Dep ression." 

Obama said without 
government intervention 
unemployment could 
reach double digits.. The 



economycould hit a low 
point that may not be 
reversible, he said. 

Obama is calling the 
bill a "recovery and rein- 
vestment" plan, He said 
he plans to create more 
jobs and invest in educa- 
tion and infrastructure. 

"At its core is a very 
simple idea," Obama 
said. "To put Americans 
back to work, doing the 
work America needs to 
be done." 



Families could receive up 
to $1,000, which Obama 
said he wants families to 
use to buy necessities. 

"IF you don't have mon- 
ey, you can't spend it, and 
if you don't spend it, our 
economy will continue 
to decline," he said. 

Obama wants to 
prioritize cutting energy 
costs by making Ameri- 
can homes more energy- 
efficient and by giving tax 
breaks to companies that

Obama said his plan 
will create 3 to 4 million 
jobs over the next two 
years in public works 
projects like roads and 
bridges, school building 
improvements and alter- 
native energy. 

The plan will also pro- 
vide for extended unem- 
ployment insurance and 
health care for workers 
that have lost their jobs 
in the recession. 

Tax cuts for lower- and 
middle-class families are 
also in the bill, which he 
said are essential to help- 
ing the economy recover. 



develop alternative ener- 
gy sources such as solar 
panels and windmills. 

He said that the 
country should invest in 
"green" energy. 

"1 want to help make In- 
diana an energy-produc- 
ing state, not just an en- 
ergy-consuming state," 
Obama said. 

While Obama said the 
bill was not perfect, he 
added "doing nothing 
was not an option." 

As the president spoke, 
the faces in the packed 
gymnasium varied, for- 
mer factory workers. 



students, military veter- 
ans and immigrants all 
looked on as the .presi- 
dent promoted his plan. 
Malinda Schutz, 17. 
and Shawndray Gates. 
16, were allowed to take 
the day off from Elkhart 
Memorial High School to 
see the president speak. 
The recession has been 
difficult on both of their 
families. Schutz lost her 
after-school job, and 
both Schutz's and Gate's 
fathers were laid off from 
their factory jobs this 
past year. 

Both of their families 
are now living on a tight 
budget, but are faring 
better than some other 
area residents. Gates said 
she noticed many of her 
peers can no longer even 
afford to buy lunch. 

"I've noticed that a lot 
of kids don't eat lunch or 
they are always asking 
for money," Gates said. 
"Even if they do have it, 
they're trying to save it." 

Jesus Fernandez left 
Mexico ten years ago to 
work in a factory that 
makes windows for RVs, 
but has recently had his 
work schedule reduced 
to two days a week. He 
has had a difficult time 
supporting his wife and 
two daughters. 

"I go door to door ask- 
ing for work," Fernandez 
said. 

He has done lawn 
work and cleared drive- 
ways for extra cash. 
"I'll do anything," he 
said.

Back in my day, peo- 
ple talked to one anoth- 
er at the gym. 

No, really! The iPod 
might be the single worst 
invention in fitness his- 
tory, at least from a so- 
cial perspective. I can 
now spend two hours at 
the gym and never once 
talk to another soul, ex- 
cept perhaps a greeting 
to the employees at the 
desk. 

Between the pod- 
casts I bring, the televi- 
sions broadcasting on 
the FM channels inside 
the gym, and the music 
blaring over the speak- 
ers, interacting with 
fellow gym members is 
restricted, at best. Heck, 
even when we do inter- 
act, perhaps to ask, "are 
you done with that ma- 
chine?" or "can I work 
in with you?" we don't 
bother to pull the buds 
out of our ears. 

Now, as people get 
used to the technology, 
these things become less 
of a barrier. How often 
do you see two people 
with ear buds in talking 
to one another while 
you can clearly hear the 



music still playing? It's 
funny if you think about 
it. In my day — the era of 
carrying around huge 
boom boxes up on one 
shoulder and breaking 
out into a spontaneous 
breakdance on occa- 
sion—the sight of two 
folks doing this would 
have been even funnier: 
like two very loud tall- 
ships passing one an- 
other with verbal broad- 
sides. 

Next time you go to 
the gym, try leaving the 
iPod at home. Say hi to 
new people, ask about a 
particular exercise you 
see someone doing that 
looks interesting. Most 
people at the gym are 
social and like to talk 
about what they're do- 
ing. If you've ever seen 
people~cha(ting it up al 
the gym like old friends, 
don't be surprised if they 
didn't meet at the gym. 

It's a lot more fun to 
get through your work- 
out when you know the 
people around you, and 
it can even give you a lit- 
tle boost on days when 
you're flagging.

EBUILD 



From Billy to Bobby: how a new coach means everything that we 
knew about IPFW baseball is about to change. 



2009 Brooks Wallace Watch list 

Coach Pierce on Brandon: 

"Coming in and inheriting a program, that (a player like 
Knowling) is a coach's dream. Not only did he go out and 
put up great numbers and do ali that great stuff, he's left 
handed, which is a true premium in the college game. 
He's going to be a big piece in what we are trying to get 
done this year." 




Story by Dan Vance • Photos by Lucas Carter 

IPFW won 157 games in the past nine seasons under coach Billy 
Gernon, 1 15 of which during the Division! era. 

Junior Mark Carden was on the 2007 Ping All-Freshman 
team. 

Senior Brandon Knowling is coming off a seven win 
season, totalling half of the Mastodons total wins in 2008. 
This is all important information, but as of right now, 
it all means nothing. 

It all means nothing because on July 23, it was 
announced that Gernon was leaving [he IPFW program 
to join the staff at Michigan State and on August 18, 
Bobby Pierce replaced him. A new coach, many 
differences and everything that we all thought we 
knew is about to change- if it hasn't already. 

"I just want to have a much higher level of 
expectation for our success and what we mean by 
success," Pierce said right off the bat. "A lot of that 
has to do with how we think and approach the game 
and our mental approach to it." 

The changes that Pierce has already instilled and 

is working towards will come in all shapes, sizes and 

colors. Some of them will be visible and others will 

be completely internal. 

Success in the past has mostly been defined for 

IPFW baseball in terms of wins, but not in Pierce's 

vision for the future. 

"Our way to achieving success is turning the page 

and kind of breaking down barriers that we haven't 

done in the past," Pierce says. 

Pierce will attempt to break those down with a fresh 

perspective that he brings to IPFW after two seasons at 

Division IJ Metro State and three prior to that as an assistant 

at Arkansas- Little Rock. Among the things Pierce brings is a new approach 

to offense that Pierce and Knowling are both quick to call amazing. 

"It's amazing how much better their (hitters) bat speed is and how 
much better they hit," Knowling said. 

"There is a technique and approach that is very challenging," Pierce 

said of the newly implemented hitting system. "I wouldn't say that it's a 

total 180 from what was being taught before, but it's definantly different." 

Pierce noted that he'd like to see his team lead the conference in walks 

this coming season. They totalled 134 walks in 2008, last in the league. 



"Offensively, we want to be a real disciplined, grind me down type of 
offense where we are going to get opposing pitchers up in the pitch count," 
Pierce said. "That means guys on our team taking strikes, getting in the 
count on purpose." 

In the held, Pierce is still sorting things out, but has some solid ideas of 
starting positions. 

"Probably the one guy that has solidified his spot is Garrett Seagraves," 
Pierce said. "He's had a really good spring and looks like he's going to have 
a monster year for us." 

Leadership wise, Pierce will look at senior Devin Taylor behind the 
plate. 

"He's the type of guy that has great knowledge and feel for the game," 
Pierce said. 

In the infield, Pierce is looking at time split between Carden, Chris 
Gotischall, Jordan Kohler, Jason Doerffler and Scott Micisnki as well as 
having Shaun Van Driessche at first base. 

While Seagraves is all but locked in at centerfield, Quentin Brown, Ryan 
Beer and Joel Washko will work in the outfield corners. 

On the mound, Knowling will be the focus guy. Other spots in the 
rotation will likely go to Stacy Herrold, Tyler Baatz, Chad Nielsen, A.I. 
Risedorph and Samuel Walker. 

"He (Walker) was really hungry this fall," Pierce said. "I think he was a 
guy who didn't want to be in the bullpen. He wanted to be a starter and 
take all the pressure on." 

Andrew Emge, Matt Antos and Cory Bluhm are expected to be the main 
guys out of the bullpen for the team. 

Pierce will have little lime left to figure all of thatout.The team tentatively 
starts play next Tuesday at Indiana University, but that all depends on the 
weather. Either way, they start in a trial by fire world with two invitationals/ 
tournaments in March where they play Creighton, Evansville and Purdue, 
among other teams. 

The rest of the season kicks off with a home opener against Toledo on 
March 18. They then play three straight at Michigan before \isiting Purdue 
and Butler. Summit League play opens on April 3 with four games at 11- 
time defending league champion Oral Roberts. 

All of that aside, Pierce continues to reiterate the expectation of his 
process, that which makes things all brand new when it comes to this 
program. 

"It doesn't matter where you start. As long as we keep getting better 
every week, we are going to be in great shape by conference tournament 
time," Pierce said. "We have our process that we are ultimately in control 
of. And it's about understading that, whether we go out and win the first 10 
or lose for the first 10."

"There is a technique and approach that is very challenging," Pierce 
said of the newly implemented hitting system. "I wouldn't say that it's a 
total 180 from what was being taught before, but it's definantly different." 

Pierce noted that he'd like to see his team lead the conference in walks 
this coming season. They totalled 134 walks in 2008, last in (he league.

Kristina on Defense: 

"I definitely have to be on my defensive game 
this year. We have three greal pitchers on this 
team— probably the best group of three of any 
of the teams in our conference. It is important 
that they have their teammates hack them up on 
the field, especially the catchers." 



Story by Dan Vance • Photos by Lucas Carter 

An up and down streak of softball seasons had plagued coach Keith Fisher since he 
debuted with IPFW in 2001. That streak culminated in the upward status of the 2008 
season. 

In their Summit League debut, the Mastodons went 18-24, their best record in the 
Fisher era and ended the season as the conference runner-up, just one game away from 
a conference title. 

It was a sudden, poignant and solid foundation built from a program that is looking 
to establish itself as true Summit League contenders. 

As per tradition, the Mastodons will open their season in Orlando for the Rebel 
Games. IPFW will see nine different opponents over the week span, with two games per 
day. As soon as they leave Florida, [hey will head straight to Shreveport, Louisiana for 
the Summit League opener against Centenary. 

Inpreperationfordie trip to the south, the team will spend the last week of February 
practicing at the Golf Dome so that they can get some more live action practice in that 
they can't do inside the Gates Center gym, where they are currently practicing. 

"The importance at the start for us is to be able to get outside and play in good 
weather," Fisher said of the Rebel Games. "We get down diere and usually take a couple 
of games to get aclamated to playing outdoors and this (practice at the Golf Dome] will 
help out." 

In conference, North Dakota State is the preseason favorite. Because they were 
completing their Division I certification in 2008, they were not eligible for the Summit 
League tournament, opening the door for Western Illinois to claim the title with a 17-2 
win over the Mastodons. 

IPFW will be the last team in conference to pick up their bats, as each team has already 
played between five and 10 non-conference games. NDSU is 5-0 while Centenary sits at 
7-2 at the top. Only NDSU has played less than nine games. 

And while the conference provides enough depth for IPFW to get shuffled back 
seventh of nine teams in the preseason poll this year, Fisher is not worried. 

"Last year, we were preseason ninth because we were the new people on the 
block," Fisher said. "We had to work hard and battle and we got to go to the conference 
tournament. Maybe we're not getting the respect that we should have. But hey, we'll 
earn the respect." 

In 2008, Western Illinois was the only team that IPFW played multiple times that the 
Mastodons could not manage to defeat. 

"You know, I don't think the pre-season poll is too much indication of how things 
will turn out. It's too early to tell, and there are a lot more factors put into the votes than 
just last year's results," sophomore catcher Krishna Karpun said 

"If anything, being placed in the 7th position will make us work harder to prove that 
we're better than that." 

IPFW will try to counter some of their pitfal .vith a freshman class of six, all signed 
during the months of |une and July. 

■ "We got a big group of freshmen kids, they are very athletic and they are working 
hard. But again, they are freshman." Fisher said. "Some of them will be starters because 
Of what we had to bring in to replace some of the talent that left. So we'll just see, we'll 



creating the right 

Dynasty 

a With a Summit League title just out of grasp, this season means 
everything for Softball's desire to build a dynasty 



nd hopefully we'll have those kids in the 




work through that throughout the sea: 
right spots where they need to be." 

Among those who will be expected to contribute immediatly both in the field and 
at the plate are Cassie Wolfe from Redding, California and Heather Genovese from 
Osceola, Indiana. The other freshmen are Kaylee Faurote, Ashley Carrico, Kaitlyn Frost 
and a third pitcher for the team, Courtney Cronin, 

Wolfe batted .481 as a senior in California with 36 RBI and 10 homeruns. Her 
implementation in the offense may be critical. 

The Mastodons will rely a great deal on Karpun, the top returning offensive player. 
Karpun played in and started all 42 games as a freshman and hit .331, second on the 
team. She was second on the team in hits with 43. lead in doubles with 10 and hit three 
homeruns. 

"Kris Karpun is out strongest hitter at this point in time," Fisher noted. 

"1 think offense is going to be the deciding factor on our team this year, so that 
definitely brings the heat my way a little more," Karpun said. "Of course there's a little 
weight on my shoulders, but I try not to think about it, and not listen to people talk 
about stats. It's a new year, fresh start, and our offensive success this year will depend 
on how well the nine hitters in our line-up work together." 

Fisher also says that all three pitchers are strong hitters and will need to be kept in 
the offense at some point. 

The large freshman class will be counteracted by a small upperclass. IPFW 
has no seniors and just three juniors. The juniors are all outfielders and 
Fisher expects different things each from Katy Stephens, Beatice 
Pedraza and Jil Price. 

"Ill's a hard worker and a tough kid. She'll do well for 
us," Fisher said. . ,"4't | 

He also noted that Pedraza will be the .^^| 

centerpiece of leadership for the team. 

In the infield, Fisher will rotate the three 
pitchers between the mound, the bullpen 
and first base. At second base, Genovese 
will likely start, partially depending on 
what is done at shortstop as Fisher likes 
to have two or three players considered 
per position. 

"We've been practicing Cassie there 
and Kaitlyn Frost. Kaitlyn seems like she's 
doing quite well there," Fisher said about the 
shortstop situation. 

"A different team means a different year, so I 
don't think we necessarily need to do things the 
same or different," Karpun said. "We need to figure 
out together what it's going to take to win games, and 
everyone needs to take a role and contribute to the 
effort."

David Carson returns to his old Oakland stopping grounds, but a cold shooting start slows the self-annointed 'villian'

In 1929. an event took place 
in Chicago. Illinois that was later 
dubbed The St. Valentine's Day 
Massacre. Last Saturday, 80 years 
to the day later, IPFW aimed to 
make another one, of a different 
take place in Rochester, 
Michigan. 

And anyone knows that any 
good massacre requires a true 
villain. It didn't take long to (ell 
from the boisterous jeers echoing 
through the rafters of the O'Rena, 
exactly who that villain was. 

David Carson was back home; 
a home that surely didn't share in 
the enthusiasm. Unfortunately 
for Carson, his villainy on this 
night was too unbiased. It not 
only affected Oakland, but it also 
affected David himself. 

Carson was 6-0M6 from 
the field in IPFW's 83-72 loss to 
Oakland. But, it was his first half 
against his former team that really 
hurt Carson, shooting l-for-7 
from the field with no rebounds 
and one of the Mastodons' three 
first half turnovers. 

"I was definitely being my own 
worst enemy," Carson said after 
the loss, with a slight headshake. 
"Like when they put smaller guys 
on me, not using my height and 



when they put taller guys on me, 
using my quickness." 

Things looked tike they were 
going to start well for Carson, who 
hit a deep jumper a minute into 
the game and let out a celebratory 
yelp to the vocal Oakland crowd. 

That same crowd responded 
thunderously eight minutes 
later when Carson was on the 
free throw line, shooting after 
Grizzlie Coach Greg Kampe was 
hit with a technical. The chants 
of "traitor" started and Carson, 
despite missing his six previous 
field goals, just smiled. 

"Being the other team's 
leading player, the crowd's going 
to hassle you, especially here," 
Carson said. "It's a fun role, but 
it's better when we come out with 
a victory." 

It was one of the few things 
that Carson could smile about in 
the first half. He traveled with 2:25 
to play and sat the remainder of 
the first period. 

"I just was rushing things. I 
know they tried to isolate me and 
switch up defenders on me so I 
was rushing plays a little bit in the 
first half," Carson noted. 

"It's human nature to really 
want to beat your former team 
and I thought he pushed and 
pressed a little bit and rushed 
some shots." IPFW coach Dane 
Fife added. "But, we don't win 



basketball games without Dave 
Carson on the floor." 

The senior came back strong 
in the second half. After getting 
back in his groove here and there, 
Carson knocked down a huge 
three pointer at 13:53 to give 
IPFW their first and only lead in 
the game. He celebrated again by 
skipping up court while staring 
down the entire Oakland crowd 
and bellowed with an unrivaled 
emotion. 

But even picking apart his 
former teammates like a pro on 
consecutive trips down the court 
couldn't help Carson sustain The 
lead. 

"He went out, made a couple 
shots, and got going. Bui we got 
stops on him down the stretch 
when they got it back to single- 
digits," Kampe said. "1 was very 
pleased with how we defended 
him. He got 18 points, but it took 
him 16 shots to do it." 

With 35 seconds to play, 
Carson missed a point blank 
put back that unfortunately was 
the summation of his return to 
Oakland, a trip where Carson was 
his own worst enemy. 

"We go back to practice, that's 
the root of everything- we get 
back to working hard," Carson 
said of what is next. "This was a 
good game, they beat us tonight 
so we just have to refocus." 



Tennis teams find rhythm over weekend 



The rough start for the men's 
tennis team got some life Friday 
with a 7-0 win over Robert Morris. 

Hermann Kuschke got things 
rolling for IPFW as he defeated 
Sean Curley (RMU) 6-1,6-4. Paired 
with Diego Artega in the doubles 
match, the duo played its best 
tennis of season, winning B-0. 

The men also fell 4-3 to Dayton 
during Friday's all-day tennis 
event for IPFW and Pine Ridge. 

Sophomore Felipe Gama went 
4-0 during the day and moved 
to 2-4 in singles play this season 
after winning all of his matches 
on Friday. In singles play, Gama 
beat Igor Neves (RMU) 6-2, 6-1, 
and Matt Sherman (UD) 6-4, 5-7, 
6-2. In doubles, paired with Luis 



Maselli for a pair of wins. 

The men took one of two 
matches Sunday as they edged 
SIU-Edwatdsville 4-3 and last to 
Eastern Illinois 5-1. 

Luis Maselli was the only 
Mastodon to win both of his 
matches on Sunday. He first 
cruised to victory over Cole 
Garrison (SIUE) 6-1, 6-2, and then 
beatlamie Firth (EIU) 6-1, 6-2.The 
two wins move Maselli's spring 
record to 3-5. 

The women already had their 
rhythm, they just kept it over the 
weekend. They played their first 
home matches of the year on 
Friday with 7-0 wins over Robert 
Morris and SIU-Edwardsville. 
Coming off Summit League player 



of the week honors last week, 
Yuka Kobayashi maintained her 
perfect spring record by defeating 
Katerina Rudneva(RMU) S-l, 6-3 
and Kelsey Laird(SLUE) 6-3, 2-6, 6- 
2 on Friday. 

The women also topped 
Bradley on Saturday to win their 
fifth straight. Sophomore Amy 
Recht continued her fine play this 
weekend by defeating Nicole Miller 
6-2, 6-4. With the win Saturday, 
Recht is now 6-0 in singles this 
season and an impressive 13-2 in 
2008-2009.

IPFW rebounds against Antelopes 



After a rough set of conference matches, the 
mens volleyball team rebounded last weekend 
with a sweep of first year program Grand 
Canyon. 

On Friday, the team appeared to be taking 
loo much for granted as the Antelopes came 
back after a 30-19 game one loss and upended 
IPFW in game two 32-34. 

IPFW persevered and rallied off 30-28 and 
30-26 wins to finish off the 'Lopes. 

Sophomores Darryl Shank and Ben 
Duckworth both hit for double-doubles. Shank 
posted a career high 22 kills to go with 10 digs, 
four block assists and two aces. Duckworth 
notched 1 9 kills, 10 digs and six block assists. 



Offensively. Oliver k'ook also chipped in with 
eight kills. On defense, Matt Pliske had 12 digs 
and Nathaniel Berg assisted in seven blocks. 

On Saturday, the Mastodons had an easier 
time, knocking Grand Ganyon off 3-0 {39-17. 
30-27, 30-20). Duckworth led with 12 kills, while 
Shank had nine. 

Freshman Eric Hardek helped close the 
match with back-to-back service aces. 

Duckworth is now leading IPFW with 110 
kills on the year. Kook leads in blocking with 34, 
whole Dan Mader has a team high 243 assists. 

Next Friday, the Mastodons host St. Francis 
(PA) and Saturday, PI ranked defending national 
champion Penn State visits the Gates Center.

Grizzlies trip up win streak 



ROCFIESTER, Mich. 

- Tournament life for 
IPFW's women just got 
a little more critical 
following a 76-49 loss 
today at the O'Rena in 
Rochester, Michigan. 
The bigger Oakland 
Grizzlies pounded their 
way to victory with the 
help of 44 rebounds. 

Shots were just not 
falling for IPFW, who 
made the back iron their 
best friend in the loss. 
The Mastodons shot just 
9-27 in the opening half 
and it didn't get much 
better as time went on, 
shooting 9-for-24 in the 
second period. 

Chelsey Jackson 

started the game on 
a positive, knocking 
down a three. It would 
IPFW's last bucket for 
four minutes until the 
15:07 mark. During that 
time, IPFW shot 0-for-9. 
Oakland countered with 
a 10 run, Jessica Pike and 
Melissa Jeltema each 
scoring four. 

Eva Ivanova scored 
back- to -back baskets 
near the 12-minute mark 
to keep IPFW close. But, 
an exchange of deep hits 
from Pike, IPFW's Jordan 
Zuppe and OU's Stacy 
Farrell moved the game 
back to the Grizzlies' 
pace.

Scoring wise, 

Oakland was dominant 
in the paint 130-12), off 
turnovers (22-2) and on 
the fast break (12-0). 

IPFW was paced 
by 14 from Ivan ova. 
Moore, a guard, led the 
Mastodons with nine

added seven points. 



at 4:58, Jeltema pushed 
the lead past 20. 

TheMastodons rallied 
with a 7-0 run capped by 
a Sarah Haluska three-

back OU and Pike, who 
scored six in the final 2:30

TheAuer Performance 
Hall at the Rhinehart 
Music Center was 
booming with big 
band jazz last Friday 
when internationally 
renowned jazz drummer, 
percussionist, clinician, 
author, and educator, 
Steve Houghton shared 
the stage with the IPFW 
jazz ensemble. 

Houghton originally 
acclaimed fame at the 
age of 20 as the drummer 
for Woody Herman's 
Young Thundering 

Herd. Since then, he 
has performed with 
numerous famous jazz 
names like Clay Jenkins, 
Toots Thielemans, and 



Christian McBride. 

Houghton has over 100 
recordings under his belt 
as a participating artist 
and frequently appears 
with many orchestras 
and ensembles around 
the world. Houghton 
is currently a professor 
and the Chair of 
the Department of 
Percussion at Indiana 
University's Jacobs 

School of Music. 

Last Friday evening, 
Houghton and the IPFW 
jazz ensemble played 
a number of sweet 
golden oldies that left 
the audience with good 
vibrations. Upbeat hits 
such as "Manteca", "I 
Ain't Got Nobody" and 
"DangerousCurves"were 
just some of the many 
finger-snapping tunes, 



along with some slow 
and smooth jazz pieces 
like "Goodbye Porkpie 
Hat" and "Happy Days". 

Not only did 
Houghton glorify the 
stage with his snazzy 
drum solos, but many 
members of the jazz 
ensemble were able to 
do the same. Trombonist 
Justin Smith, bassist Jesse 
West, pianist Alicia Pyle, 
drummer Evan Lewis, 
saxophonists Ben Essick, 
Logan Weber and Kenny 
Woods, tubist Zach 
Kohlmeier, trumpeter 
Aaron Trammel and 
vibist Jose Morales all got 
to display their special 
talents with the crowd.

Lights camera action, we gonna get our fash'on," 
does anyone remember this illustrious song featured 
on Old Navy commercials about 3 yrs ago? The song 
invokes images of models strutting down catwalks, 
flash bulbs bursting with illumination, and most 
importantly the new season's top designs on display. 
This is a dream of Kari Larsen, to exhibit her art on 
the runway at a fashion show. 

Unlike most college freshmen Larsen knows what 
she wants to do with her life. She first heard the calling 
at a young age, when her aunt had taught her how to 
sew. Larsen began to realize her life's goal, to become a 
fashion designer. Design combines her two passions, 
art and fashion. Larsen explained, "When you add art 
to fashion you get design." Ideally she wants to be 
able to design wedding and prom dresses. 

Larsen does most of her experimenting with 
Barbie dolls. She takes pieces of fabric, and creates 
miniature dresses, essentially turning the dolls into 
manikins. Larsen spends much of her time, doodling 
and sketching, "I'm very creative and doodling 
expressing who I am." 

Larsen is beginning her journey into fashion 
design by receiving a bachelor's degree in fine arts- 
drawing and sculpture- from IPFW. She wants to 



have a sound foundation in fine arts first and then get 
her master's degree from the International Academy 
of Design and Technology, for fashion. Larsen wants 
to be able to start at the bottom and work her way up 
to become a designer, learning as much as she can 
along the way. 

Inspired by nature; most of her work incorporates 
elements of nature in some way. Her signature is the 
butterfly it seems that almost everything she does 
features a butterfly in some way. "I love butterflies; I 
just can't get away from them." 

Coming to IPFW is fulfilling a legacy for Larsen, 
both of her parents graduated from IPFW. Her mom 
graduates with a degree from IU and her dad from 
Purdue. Larsen gets her creativity from her mom, 
who had wanted to be an artist when she was younger 
but instead went into education.

Learning About the Opposite Sex From a Movie 



By Devin Middleton 

dculn.middletone 

lpfwromrnuni[010r.org 

Based off the best 
selling book by Greg Beh- 
rendt and Liz Tuccillo, 
He's Just Not That Into 
You brings a storyline to 
the self help guide. The 
movie details five wom- 
en and their attempts 
at having the perfect re- 
lationship. The women 
all go through different 
stuations based off of 
situations from the book. 
These range from "If he's 
not calling you", to "If 
he's not marrying you", 
to "If he's sleeping with 
someone else." 

After watching the 
movie, I became disgust- 
ed with the male gender. 
I then read book and was 
even more outraged with 
the male gender. Not 
only does it offer the hard 
truth about how ruthless 
some men can be, but it 
also reveals the insecu- 
rities and vulnerability 



that women struggle with 
on a day to day basis. Its 
quite sad actually. 

I myself was raised 
in a household with a 
mother, two sisters, and 
a dad who gave the clas- 
sic "ask your mother" re- 
sponses. It was Lifetime 
movie night, every night. 
But even when faced 
with all this, I still man- 
aged to keep my manly 
charisma. Although, I 
defidently did adopt a 
strong respect for wom- 
en and consideration of 
their feelings. Girls are 
people too, you know. 

I was just watching 
Dr.Phil the other day and 
a woman was living with 
a man in a tent because it 
didn't matter where they 
lived, as long as she was 
with him. I don't know 
whats crazier, living in 
a tent, or the fact that 
a grown man watches 
Dr.Phif from time to time. 
Either way. I found that 
to be a beautiful senti- 



Everyone should go 
see this movie, and if you 
like the movie, get the 
book. Women can leam 
alot and men can too. 
The book is very informa- 
tive, but the movie does a 
great job at allowing oth- 
ers to gain perspective. 
You get an understand- 
ing of why women do 
the things they do and 
why men think the way 
they think. I also give the 
movie alot of credit for of- 
fering, perhaps, the most 
realistic take on a happy 
ending I've ever heard in 
a fictional story.

Fanning brings 'Coraline' to Life in Stop Animation 



Roommate's Pick: 

Lightwires 



By Mark Cox 



A Dutch band from 
Utrecht, Netherlands 
seemed to just pop out 
of nowhere with dieir 
new ER Last Night Elec- 



tric, released Novem- 
ber 2008. Lighiwires is 
worthy of some serious 
consideration being un- 
signed and releasing this 
first EP. "All in all, we are 
making good progress. 
1 assure hair has been 
torn out, frustrations 



have been vocalized, 
we've exchanged some 
dirty looks, but it's all in 
the interest of making 
something good. Time 
will tell," said singer and 
guitarist lun Herbach. 

While their influ- 
ences range from Ra- 
diohead, The Beades, 
to TV on the Radio, they 
manage to write refresh- 
ing and unique songs to 
put them on the path to 
success. Herbach and

Coraline Jones is a cu- 
rious and adventurous 
pre teen that just moved 
from Michigan. Her only 
comfort is a wild imagi- 
nation, triggered by drab 
living conditions. Cora- 
line is a bitter and sarcas- 
tic character, a comple- 
ment to the prep ubes cent 
Dakota Fanning's style of 
verbal delivery. Fanning 
is surprisingly fun to lis- 
ten to as Coraline. 

Originally from Geor- 
gia, the actor manages to 
makeCoralines mid west- 
ern phonetics convinc- 
ing. Her voice embraces 
Michigan's slight Wis- 
consin twang, blending 
a hint of Canadian shrill. 
Considering I didn't have 
to put up with Fanning's 
robotic face, I couldn't 
help but notice. 

In the film, no one can 
manage her name. Her 
parents fail to nurture 

multi-instrumentalist 
Jeff Taylor began writing 
and recording music to- 
gether as Ani- 
mistTrance in 
2006 and per- 
formed small 
acoustic per- 
formances. 
Seeing how 
popular their 
duo became 
they emerged 
in the Dutch music scene 
and paired up with Sjo- 



her, working endlessly 
on their computers. Her 
only potential friend is 
a jabbering stalker - the 
awkward, Wyborn. And 
as a black cat follows 
our main character, we 
assume she is lost like 
many children her age, 
who begin to realize that 
life is flawed and con- 
stantly superstitious ( in 
reference to Coraline). 

The film begins with a 
creepy credits sequence 
where a terminator type 
hand is sewing together 
a doll. The scene is an 
introduction to the stop 
animation film, closing 
in on the intricacy and 
craftsmanship of the 
production. Everything 
you see in the movie is a 
miniature made by hand 
and every movement re- 
corded is hand manipu- 
lated. 

The film is a pinnacle 
to Henry Selick's career. 
Responsible for writ- 
ing and directing similar 
productions such as 'The 

erd van der Sanden (an 
accomplished drum- 
mer! and Lightwires was 
Formed. 
Mainly la- 
beled as al- 



Nightmare Before Christ- 
mas' and 'James and Gi- 
ant Peach,' Selick's trans- 
lation of Neil Gaiman's 
novela is fantastical. 

The themes posed in 
the story, however, are 
no child fantasy. The tale 
mirrors like Alice in Won- 
derland, propped with 
what appears to be magic 
mushrooms and a worm- 
hole that takes Coraline 
between worlds. The Ele- 
ments are child like, but 
their representation are 
adult. Decisions and di- 
lemmas Coraline is faced 
with parallels the Matrix. 
Ultimately, the film ends 
like Jumanji.

"Have you ever wanted to pick up something big 
and hit someone? Now you can." said Seth Larimer, 
head of the Northern Indiana division of a new sport 
to IPFW called Dagorhir. 

Dagorhir is a type of role playing game in which 
chivalry and a code of conduct play a major role not 
only during the games or lights, but also in the players' 
daily lives. 

"It teaches you to be honorable by following the 
s, playing fair and getting along with others," said 
Larimer. "Just this alone will carry over [into daily 
life] making you a better person." 

This is the first rime that IPFW has ever 

heard of Dagorhir. Though it is not 

widely known in Fort Wayne, it is 

quite well known throughout the 

United States within the circle of 

nerds" and videogame players. 

"If you are not inclined towards dorkiness, 
you might think it's weird." said Larimer. 
This game is not only fun, but it is a great 



way to get exercise. Though it may not seem like you 
are doing laps around the track, running or jogging up 
and down the field goes almost unnoticed when you 
are completely into the game. 

"It's good for people who are not ready to enter a 
gym." said John Adams, head of the IPFW chapter. It is 
also a great way to get out the frustrations that college, 
or just life in general, may bring. 

Though safe and generally injury free, it is a one 
hundred percent full contact sport. If someone wants 
to run at you full force, they are allowed to do so. But 
what exactly is this renaissance role play and how did 
it come to be? 

According to Dagorhir.com, it "combines fast- 
paced, full-contact combat simulation with elements 
of live action role-playing. Dagorhir combines ele- 
ments of both history and fantasy.
