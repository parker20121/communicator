Fort Wayne police on the line 



News Analysis 



N«i 



: Editor 



Police brutality has become a 
controversial issue for most 
large cities in the United 
States Recently, concerned commu- 
nity leaders have made it known to 
U.S. District Attorney General Jon 
DeGuilio that police harassment and 
brutality exist in medium-sized 
urban cities in the Midwest such as 
Hon Wayne 

It began in December when The 
Concerned Citizens Alliance, made 
up of local leaders from the Urban 
League. NAACP, Stop the Madness 
and others, collected 36 video tapes 
as evidence supporting alleged acts 
of violence by Fori Wayne police 
officers. The evidence was sent to 
DeGuilio. 

On Sat.. Jan. 25, more than 
1.000 Fort Wayne residents came to 
the Greater Progressive Baptist 



Church Concerned citizens called 
for Police Chief T. Neil Moore to be 
removed from command and rec- 
ommendations for change were 
given by the Concerned Citizens 
Alliance. The forum was also put 
together by the Alliance to voice 
concerns about accusations of 
racism within the police department. 

Mayor Paul Helmke, Rev. 
Temae Jordan, and assistant Chief 
of Police Dan Hannaford were 
among the speakers answering 
questions Many in the audience 
asked why the police department 
bad not made progress towards 
equal treatment and why officers 
who had complaints against them 
had not been fired. 

The slate law which dictates that 
neither Helmke nor Moore can fire 
an officer gave people little relief 
But Helmke mentioned that those 
with complaints against them had 
been re-assigned. 

Recommendations made by the 
the group that Helmke hopes to 
implement include creating a citi- 



zens watchdog organization, 
expanding the citizens contact 
office, placing video cameras in 
squad cars, giving more authority to 
Public Safety Director Payne 
Brown, and increasing the number 
of citizens on the Board of Public 
Safely. Some changes have already 
been made 

Captain Jim Crawford, who was 
appointed head of internal affairs, 
has already expanded the Citizens 
Contact Office; and the department 
reduced the number of squad cars 
responding to traffic stops. Steps 
will also be taken during the recruit- 
ment and training of officers up for 
hire. 

Board of Safely member Hanna 
Smith hopes that more minorities 
will become police officers. 

The next few months will be a 
probation period for the entire Fort 
Wayne police force Whether 
Helmkc's actions at the forum will 
have an effect on the officers in the 
upcoming months will take lime to 
determine.

Fat Tuesday 



Jerry Diehl. M.S.. will present "Fat Tuesday," a discussion about 
fat's role in a good diet. Diehl will also explain the difference between 
scale weight and body fat. 

The event is sponsored by me IPFW Wellness Council. 

The event will take place on Tuesday, Feb. 11, noon-1 p.m. in the 
IPFW Gates Sports Center. Room 103. It will be in honor of the annu- 
al Mardi Gras celebration of excess. 

Diehl says fat is a necessary component of good nutrition; howev- 
er, when stored in excess, problems will occur High-fat diets lead to 
easier storage of body fat. Diets rich in carbohydrate, and protein, arc 
less likely to store excess intake as fat.

Living In oblivion 

Weather causes campus closures 



Putting fun 
back into 
physics 



by Carmen Robinson 
StafT Writer 

Currently the physics depart- 
ment has 350 students enrolled in 
classes and 13 majors Despite the 
number of majors, the physics fac- 
ulty and students remain optimistic. 

"We think enrollment will go 
high because we have a number of 
new exciting courses...," said John 
Robinson, chair of the physics 
department 

Most of the new courses are 
designed for non-majors. Light and 
Color, Introduction to Lasers, 
Physics of Sports, and The First 
Three Minutes are already included 
in the bulletin. 

Light and Color involves elec- 
tromagnetic waves and visible 
wavelengths of light Introduction 
to Lasers explores uses of lasers in 
the science, industry, construction, 
communication, entertainment and 
medical fields In Physics of 
Sports, students study physical 
principles of popular sports such as 
golf and baseball, and learn advan- 
tages for sports performance. The 
First Three Minutes covers such 
topics as galaxies, the four forces, 
relativity. Big Bang and the creation 
of the universe. 

In addition to new courses, 
physics majors at IPFW are current- 
ly up to national standards, offering 
"exciting new opportunities," 



by Shannon Flnton 
Chkf Reporter 

Slippery sidewalks, haz- 
ardous roads and school 
cancellations... these three 
things always seem to follow when 
weather conditions become too 
frigid. Yet, how do administrators 
finally come to the decision to can- 
eel school? 

Many students feel ihat IPFW 
is a commuter college. However, 
according to Walter Branson, vice 
chancellor of financial affairs, this 
college is actually considered a 
business and is treated as such. 

Branson says students should 
be treated as if they were men and 
women in the business field who 
are required to attend work regard- 
less of how severe the weather may 
be. According to Branson, it is ulti- 
mately the students' decision on 
whether they can make it here or 
noL 

Prime factors in determining iT 
the campus closes include the con- 
ditions of campus and the severity 
of the road conditions. 

When the weather starts to get 
dangerous for travellers, and roads 
cannot slay clear, Branson, the 
chancellor, the grounds crew and 
the Physical Plant, all help in mak- 
ing ihe appropriate decision. 

"What's happening with the 
weather is usually a bard decision 
to make," said Branson. 

"It's a no-win situation. If we 
close the school people gel angry 
and if we keep it open they are still 
angry," said Branson. 



added Robinson. 

Within the laser lab, majors per- 
form experiments, excite mole- 
cules, study atoms and build lasers. 
"In physics, you deal with 
what's directly observable. It is a 
very basic science. It answers the 
question, 'How?' and it is the only 
science that doesn't rely on any- 
thing else but just physics," said 
Mark Masters, assistant professor. 

Masters is candid about some 
high school physics courses. 

"A lot of teachers never had 
more than one course in physics so 
they do not give the right outlook," 
said Masters. 

Masters points out this is the 
reason why this branch of science 
might seem "bard." 

Recently, six student papers 
were presented at the Ann Arbor. 
Michigan - National Conference 
and in Toronto for the International 
Conference In true spirit of the 
department's new national stan- 
dards, two of these articles, co- 
authored by physics faculty, were 
accepted for publication in the pres- 
tigious, "American Journal of 
Physics" Robinson hopes ihese 
achievements wdl create interest in 
a program attempting to renew 
itself 



On Thursday, Jan. 17, Branson 
said morning traffic seemed to be 
moving okay during the day. As 
the day progressed things began 
icing up and the grounds crew 
found it impossible to keep lire 
roads clear. 

Cold wind chills and a con- 
stant, falling temperature became 
evident on Thursday. On Friday, 
the weather remained the same, 

Classes were eventually can- 
celled on Thursday evening. Ail 
classes were cancelled on Friday. 

"We close an average of two to 
three days a year," said Branson. "I 
have only been here four years, but 
I know it's something like that." 

When the weather Is bad it Is 
ultimately the students' decision if 
(hey can make it to campus safely. 

According to IVY Tech and 
Saint Francis College administra- 
tors, they often follow the deci- 
sions made on other campuses. 
Both schools closed on Thursday 
and Friday also. 

Sister Elaine, who is the vice 
president for academic affairs for 
Saint Francis college, helps with 
the decision-making along with the 
president. Sister Elise. 

"We took to see what others 
are doing and try to follow suit," 
said Sister Elaine. 

In the event of a school clos- 
ing, radio stations are called along 
with television stations to Inform 
area residents. 

Students may call the campus 
to receive up-to-date class cancel- 
lations by calling 481- 
5770 or 481-6050. 



There is ample opportunity for 
graduate research 

"There's book learning but also 
learning from your experience," 
said Casey Lengacher. freshman "I 
get lo see atoms, their orbits actual- 
ly have a physical dimension," 
added Lengacher. 

Certain professions require an 
understanding of the principles of 
physics. 

"You must have it to operate 
medical machines like MRI's," said 
Douglas Brockway, a physics 
major 

Five recent graduates of the 
physics department show how 
diversified the discipline can be. 

"One went to graduate school ai 
Notre Dame; one teaches locally 
and the other three are working for 
local industries such as ITT, 
Magnavox and the DOT Group," 
said Robinson. 

Graduates of physics may also 
pursue careers in "patent law and 
medical physics," according to 
Robinson 

The physics department contin- 
ues to promote a fun atmosphere for 
discovery for any student who 
enrolls. 

"You play with big industrial 
toys all day," said Lengacher

Decisions: A Practical Guide (o 
Success in College." Published by 
Harcourt Brace College Publishers 
in November 1996, it is the latest 
book written by Gerow and his wife. 
This textbook is unique because it 
not only covers how to cope with 
academic challenges bui also gives 
general information on personal and 
social issues. 

"The first part of the book is 
based on my thirty years experience 
as a university professor, academic 
adviser and teacher of 'how to 
study' courses,' said Joshua Gerow. 
"It focuses on academic decisions 
ranging from how to read a bulletin, 
to study habits, note taking and test 
taking." 

In the first part of this guide, 
there is an emphasis on the practical 
application of several academic 
techniques which hopefully allow 
one to enjoy the quality of college 



focuses on personal and social 

adjustments to college life including 

issues such as 



"Success doesn't 
grades, it 
means 
becoming a

son," said 
Gerow. 
"Chapter

Professor Garcia: 



Picasso, Monet and 
Boticelli. often the name of ihe 
anist is as important as the piece he 
creates An artist's dedication to 
bringing forth inventive works is a 
life-long process. Often, the process 
includes many twists and turns, with 
several awkward outcomes. 

Hector Garcia, associate profes- 
sor of fine arts, knows what it is like 
being a snuggling anisl. Garcia has 
been in the field all bis life. 

"I've been involved with art 
since early cbildbood," said Garcia. 
"I became driven by my need to 
work on art. I didn't know where it 
would lead; I just knew I had to do 
ft." 

Growing up in Puerto Rico, 
Garcia did not use crayons or pen- 
cils; he used clay. Garcia says he 
was always encouraged to grow 
through his art. 

"It's the pan of man that I think 
needs to be fed early," said Garcia. 
"Children need to learn that there 
arc other pans of the soul besides 
just the practical " 



After World War II, Garcia 
moved to the Midwest. He began 
teaching in an attempt to help pay 
the bilk. He has been at IPFW for 
the last five years 

"Teaching is somewhat like 
gravy on the side," said Garcia. "An 
is just not a profit type of occupa- 
tion." 

Garcia was recently notified thai 
the American Numismatic Society 
(ANS) would like to include his Fon 
Wayne Bicentennial medal in its 
permanent collection. ANS. an orga- 
nization that supports the sculpting 
and exhibition or medals, is based in 
New York City and has a museum in 
Colorado. 

"The medal was designed with 
the idea of conveying the history of 
Fort Wayne with inclusion of the 
Ihrec rivers," said Garcia 

According 10 Garcia, the throe 
rivers and iheu symbols are meant 
to symbolize the Miami Indians, dif- 
ferent ways of transportation and the 
process of the industry, all convey- 
ing the heritage of the city. 

Garcia exhibited two medals at 
the 1996 Congress of the 
International Medal Federation 



Up close 

(FTDEM) in Switzerland last June, 
where the ANS first noticed the 
Bicentennial medal, Garcia's work 
there included a bonded brass 
maquette proposed for a monument 
to the numismatic arts and a bronze 
Fon Wayne Bicentennial medal. 

"I also bave medals scattered 
throughout Fon Wayne, including 
the public library," said Garcia. 

Because of the size of the exhib- 
it facilities, the U.S. exhibit was lim- 
ited to 60 sides (medals can be sin- 
gle or double-sided). The jury that 
selected the entries chose recent 
works (since 1990) that had never 
been shown at FTDEM. 

The ANS also has a copy of 
Garcia's medal, "Flame of 
Freedom," in its permanent collec- 
tion. 

This year, Garcia plans to retire 
from teaching and begin to work 
full-time in his studio. However, 
even though he is excited, there are 
many aspects with teaching he will 
miss. 

"I always tell my students thai if 
they really want to be an artist, they 
need to set other things aside," said 
Garcia. 



_ A profile of 
The Greek life IPFW ° r S anizati °" s 



by James Corson 
SUff Writer 

Every semester, groups on cam- 
pus advertise their organization and 
what they have to offer 
students. Some of the major groups 
which attempt to draw in individuals 
are the Greeks (fraternities and 
sororities). 

Whether it is the two social fra- 
ternities on campus. Phi Kappa 
Tbeta and Sigma Phi Epsilon; or the 
two sororities. Pi Beta Phi and Delia 
Gamma, each has its own individual 
uniqueness and characteristics which 
set tbem apari from the others. Some 
may ask themselves, "What do these 
organizations have to offer me?" 

What fraternities and sororities 
have to offer goes well beyond the 
typical "Animal House" version. 
Cast out the images you have in your 
mind of the unintelligent-bimbo 
sorority girl or the chronically-drunk 
fraternity guy. The Greek life is 
about the brotherhood and sisterhood 
among members. It is a successful 
attempt to bnng individuals together. 



look out for one another, and carry 
with them the qualities which these 
organizations bring to us through 
life. These organizations can supply 
you with valuable life experience 
They help build leadership qualities, 
develop social skills, and focus on 
higher education, it is not only a col- 
lege "phase" either, members are 
there for life, allowing them to net- 
work themselves through business 
and organizations Alumni also give 
back to their organization, whether it 
is monetary or through wisdom. 

These organizations also value 
the individual characteristics that a 
student might be able to bring to 
their groups. Granted, the greek life 
is not for everyone. At the beginning 
of each semester, each group offers 
students an opportunity, called rush, 
to meet with the members of the fra- 
ternities and sororities Rush gives 
students a chance to be informed 
about attributes, and allow them to 
decide for themselves if this would 
be the proper direction for them. 

Fraternities and sororities can 
also be much fun. Not everything

Contemporary Works by African- 
American Women," beginning Feb. 
1. Fort Wayne will be the first city to 
host this rare exhibit. 

Contemporary issues such as 
race, gender, ethnicity, class and 
relationships will be seen through 
the perspective of African- American 
women artists. The names of pro- 
gressive artistic women are often 
overlooked as a result of other 
prominent male artists. 

"It was not until 1970s or 1980s 
that a lot of African-American 
women artists competed with male 
artists," said Robert Schroeder. 
curator of the Fort Wayne 
Museum of Art. 

"Despite over 300 years of 
racial, sexual and economic oppres- 
sion, African- American women

continue to demonstrate that their 
creative talents will not be sup- 
pressed," said lane Johnson, public 
information coordinator. 

The featured speaker and guest 
curator will be Jontyle Robinson, 
associate professor of art history, 
Spellman College, Atlanta. Georgia. 
Spellman College is one of the old- 
est black colleges The art being dis- 
played at the "Bearing Witness" 
exhibit is from twenty-three stu- 
dents from Spellman' s art program 
and other Georgia natives. The 
exhibit was originally organized to 
commemorate the opening of the 
college's new art 
museum on Jan. 31 

This exhibit is very important to 
the Fort Wayne Museum of Art 
"February is also Black History 
Month, so we are very interested in 
helping to create a lot of community 
awareness," said Schroeder. 

The mediums the artists used 
are varied as well as the themes. A 



metal worker. C bam e lie Hollo way, 
is known for her expression of the 
true meaning of the modem African- 
American woman. Quilts created by 
Debra Priestly, signify quilts that 
were once meant to hang on clothes- 
lines outside of homes; a symbol for 
people using the Underground 
Railroad. Other mediums used are 
photography, jewelry-sculp- 
ture and paintings. 

"People will see a lot of very 
contemporary work; it's actually a 
very intellectual show," said 
Schroeder. "The art has a lot of 
tough images, but through color, 
shape and texture, the future is dealt 
with in a positive sense. Art always 
reflects social change It never pre- 
cedes social change " 

It is important for black women 
to celebrate their progress, success, 
and to promote positive changes for 
the future There are many diverse 
lifestyles within American 
communities. 



"They (African American 
women) have to be very strong; they 
hold families as do all women they 
do a lot of educating. We can't keep 
it (black culture) separate. It all must 
come together." 

The Fort Wayne An Museum's 
members' preview of "Bearing 
Witness" is Friday, Jan. 31, at/pm. 
Prices are $6 for members and S10

Bubble gum bandit 

Fair punishment for officer 



A Mi the innocence of bub- 
ble gum — or so wc 
ihougbt. Well, ihere is 
nothing innocent about detective 
Scott Morales' act of stealing bub- 
ble gum Nearly everyone has 
formed an opinion about the inci- 
dent in which Morales was caught 
stealing a 25-cenl piece of bubble 
gum during a burglary investiga- 
tion The fact that it was bubble gum 
and cost only 25 cents lends to the 
feeling of the innocence of this enme. 

Many feci the irony is that he 
was investigating an earlier theft 
that occurred at the location. We 
would like to point out that the real 
irony is that he is an officer who has 
sworn to uphold the law and instead 
went against iL 

Consequently, the Fort Wayne 
Board of Safety suspended Morales 
for three months without pay and 
ordered him to undergo counseling 
Many Teel that the punishment 
is too harsh, even ridiculous, and are 
outraged thai an officer of the law 
has been punished (or stealing a 25- 
ccnt piece of gum when he could be 
out on the streets getting the real 
"bad guys." Well, we hate to break it 
to the community, but stealing, is 
stealing, is stealing 

Granted wc live in a society in 
which there are gradations of crime, 
and granted, stealing a 25-ccnt piece 
of gum is certainly the smallest of 
minor crimes, but nonetheless it is a 
crime Thus we are pleased that the 
Board of Safety is holding him 
accountable for his actions. 

If the Board of Safety is mak- 
ing an example out of Morales for 
the rest of the police department 
(the department that already has 



enough worries facing harassment 
charges from certain members of 
the city), then we think they have 
made their point. Furthermore, they 
sent a strong message to the entire 
police department that they are not 
above the law Three months with- 
out pay seems adequate punishment 
for a 25 -cent crime 

We arc also glad to see that 
Morales has admitted his shameful 
act and lakes full responsibility for 
it. Surely most of us understand the 
embarrassment and shame that 
Morales feels, and the shame he has 
placed on ihc entire police depart- 
ment. And rightly so. 

If law enforcement officers are 
to set examples for children and the 
general public alike, they too must 
be held accountable for their actions 
and abide by the same rules that 
civilians do, and be punished for 
any criminal activity. 

The question then is whether or 
not Morales should have been fired. 
Can an officer of the law be 
viewed as being ethical when he 
was caught stealing? 

Firing Morales for stealing gum 
would have been viewed as too 
harsh a punishment for sure. We all 
make mistakes and need to remem- 
ber that Morales is only human and 
worthy of a second chance 

It should be noted that we 
do not believe that Morales' 
action is representative of the 
entire department. 

Having acknowledged that 
there are gradations of crime in our 
society, a much more severe pun- 
ishment is expected if certain offi- 
cers are found guilty of harassing 
members of our community. 



Albright makes history, 
opens doors for women 



It is official! Madeline Albright 
is now Secretary of State Can 
enough be said about 
Albrights succession to Secretary

highest-ranking woman in U.S.

It has been long overdue thai 
our government places women in

Letters to the Editor 



Talking 'bout our generation 

Why ask Y? 



To the editor 

Attempting to altach a name to a 
generation is truly an assignment far 
greater than any one individual could 
possibly hope to achieve. In a recent 
guest column, a fellow student came 
extremely close but didn't complete- 
ly drive the point home 

We have two distinct, yet similar 
generations, flourishing in America 
today Most of us are used to hearing 
about Generation X's struggles, for 
we had very little choice on-the sub- 
ject Yet I wonder if our generation 
isn't truly the unknown one, since 
we currently have no identity sepa- 
rating us from GenXers 

Keeping this in mind, I will take 
a logical step and say we're 
Generation Y Why do I use the 
letter Y? Beyond being the 
first letter in youth, it's also anoth- 
er letter often used to signify that 
which is unknown. 

Our generation has very little 



individualism; people who consider 
themselves to be pan of this genera- 
tion see themselves as a whole. 
Almost as if we're all still in kinder- 
garten. Please don't misunderstand 
me We're definitely adults or none 
of us would be silling in college at 
ibe present moment. I'm inclined to 
believe most, if not all, of 
Generation Y gets bored extremely 
easily, especially when confined 
within a classroom. Would this be 
called the Peter Pan complex? I'm 
not a psychologist so I'll leave that 
decision up to those trained to under- 
stand the human mind. 

We appear lo be children in 
many ways, we enjoy new objects 
for a short period of time, ihen we 
desire lo move on to something new. 
Perhaps we'll all locate careers 
which don't create utter boredom, 1 
doubt it though. We now have the 
opportunity lo take the baton from 
the GenXers and advance il to yet 
another level in ibis continuum 



This is an extremely unique situ- 
ation in the hisiory of America. After 
all. how often have two generauoas 
coincided with each other and a third 
— only a few years down the road? 
We should all do our best not lo lei 
this opportunity pass without speak- 
ing our minds. 

Usually it's typical for a person 
to desire to return to grade school 
days. However, most realize this 
isn't plausible and they lcam to 
move on. I wonder if our generation 
is truly willing to give up on the 
dream of being able to go outside at 
recess to play Red Rover just like 
we're alt in first grade again 

We all worked together in grade 
school, searching as a whole for new 
sources of entertainment. I hope now 
as a generation we're able to put (he 
word "fun" back into adulthood 

So I urge you never to get bored 
with life and never forget Saturday 
morning cartoons, waking up early 
knowing you had little of that dread- 



ed word "responsibility" — though 
most have come to accept it as part 
of being an adult. Despite growing 
up with Voodoo economics or the 
worship of wealth and greed, fun 
never used to start with your weekly 
portion of the payroll 

Who am I to name a whole gen- 
eration? I'd raiher leave that job to a 
historian after we've made our mark 
on history. Need less -to- say, it's our 
turn to stand up and speak our minds. 
Then again, if we're truly a genera- 
tion of children, who really wants to 
stand out in the crowd? 

Unless, of course, you happen to 
see the significance of these genera- 
tions — then it's your duty. So why 
not say exactly what you think with- 
out worrying about being wrong? It's 
just a thought people, don't get too 
upset, thinking was still legal the last 
lime I checked.

Pulin graduated in computer sci- 
ence, earning a bachelor of science 
degree from the School of 
Engineering. Technology and 
Computer Science, but he enjoyed 
learning in all disciplines. He applied 
himself equally to those required 
courses outside his discipline thai so 
many people labor through In the 
midst of all this study, research and

memory to become a legacy for 
future students. 

Some of us are hoping to estab- 
lish a prize for undergraduate 
research in Pulin's memory Pulin 
would not have cared whether his 
name was attached to such a prize, 
but he would have liked the idea of 
recognizing outstanding undergradu- 
ate research within IPFW. He would 
have liked the idea that future stu- 
dents would be told a story about 
another student who did unexpected 
things, especially if thai story helped 
show them that similar things arc 
within their reach.

Men's volleyball team: 

They're all set to go 



by Scott Wardci 
Staff Writer 



Over the past si* seasons, expecta- 
tions have been extremely high for 
IPFW's men's volleyball leam, and nec- 
essarily so, 7T)C 'Dons reached the Final 
Four three out of four years in the early 
'90s and were considered to be one of the 
best programs in the country. But with 
success comes the pressure of winning 
consistently. With winning 
come expectations. 

The pasi two seasons, however, were 
disappointing And after coming off a 
mediocre-at-best 10-15 record last sea- 
son, you wouldn't think that the goals for 
this year's team would be 100 lofty. 
You'd expect them to be somewhat sim- 
ple and attainable. So, Arnie Ball, head 
coach, has set only one goal for his squad 
this season, and it's quite simple — win 
the national championship. 

Expectations are going to come when 
you knock off the top-rated team in the 
country on the first weekend of play 

The Volleydons began the new season 
unranked, but showed their potential at 
the Santa Barbara Invitational, where 
they not only upset number-one ranked 
Stanford, but also the University of Cali- 
fornia-San Diego. California- 
Irvine and California-Davis 

The regular season started off with 
two Midwestern Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association wins. The first of 
which came at Loyola of Chicago, fol- 
lowed by a victory at 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee 

This past weekend the 'Dons traveled 
to Columbus, Ohio, to play in the Ohio 
Slale Invitational where they saw their 
regular season record fall to 2-2 as they 
lost to USC and Stanford. 



"We played Stanford well," Coach 
Ball said. "We did not play well against 
USC. It's kind of a thing that's happening 
here thai I'm not real crazy about. We did 
the same thing where we played really 
well against Loyola and then really poor- 
ly against Milwaukee It's kind of a trend 
we're setting and I don't have an answer 
for it yet, but it's still early in the year, so 
hopefully we'll gel it straightened out." 

Expectations are going to come when 
you land the top recruit in the 
Western Hemisphere. 

Hector Solo, a 6'6" outside hitter 
from Puerto Rico, is said to be the best 
freshman in the nation, and in his second 
regular season match, he fell only one kill 
shy of tying a national freshman record of 
51 kills in a single match. Soto also pos- 
sesses a 51 -inch vertical jump 

"Hector is an extremely talented kid," 
said Coach Ball "The first thing you 
hear about him is his jumping ability. It's 
so high that I've bad a tough lime mea- 
suring it. He's just a real strong player." 

With this year's recruiting class and 
more depth at the technical positions than 
the past few seasons, 1PFW has some sta- 
bility in its line-up, which will be a major 
change over the last couple of years. 

"We have a real good mix 
of older and younger kids who 
are all able to play at a high 
level." added Coach Bali 
"Whether they can come 
together is another story, but I 
think that we have the person- 
nel to not only compeie. but to 
win at the very lop " 

Expectations are going to 
come with IPFW's winning 
tradition, and the solution is 
very simple, yet very attain- 
able: Just win it all. 



Program offers incentives for exercise 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
Editor 

Students are not the only 
ones who feel they need to exer- 
cise Many faculty and staff also 
care about the way they look and 
feel. 

Starling on Feb. 1, the IPFW 
Employee Wellness Incentive 
Program will be working to keep 
professors fit The program is 
developed to motivate faculty 
and staff members to become 
more health conscious. There is 
no fee for participation. 

"It's a monetary program 
designed to encourage them and 
offer support," said Judy 
Tillapaugh, R.D., IPFW 
Wellness/Fiiness Coordinator 

Within the program, partici- 
pants arc required lo participate 
in physical activities that include 
aerobic training, muscular 
strengthening and flexibility 
training 

"It's a great program for peo- 
ple who don't work-out often," 
said Charles Washington, associ- 
ate director of career services and 
previous participant in the pro- 
gram. "It really helps spark inter- 



est. 

Aerobic training uses large 
rhythmic movements over a pen- 
ad of time. Some examples 

would be walk- _ 

ing, running, 
swimming and f , ~j 
biking. Jbfl\. -.■=■ — 
Muscular i^ 
strengthening 
consists of 
activities such 
as weight train- 
ing, nautilus, 
sil-ups and free 
weights. 
Flexibility 
trainin 
includes basic 
stretching exer- 
cises for a time 
span of 15 to 30 
seconds. 

All types of 
be done three times a week. 

Each participant will 
complete an activity calen- 
dar, where they log their 
physical activity day by 
day. Prizes are then award- 
ed on a semester basis to 
those who continue to exer- 
cise regularly. 



"I enjoyed it quite a bit," said 
Jerry Diebl, stockroom supervi- 
sor for the chemistry department 
and previous participant in the 
— program. "It 




ives 
recognition, 
and that's 
kind of nice." 

Awards will

Economy affects 
enrollment for spring 



Do Lhe math 

A reported 45 fewer students are 
enrolled for Lhe spring semester than 
were enrolled for spring classes a 
year ago. Some 10.120 students 
were enrolled in Lhe spring of 1996 
Currently, 10.077 are enrolled. This 
is 672 less students than were 
enrolled in the fall 

Frank Borclli, vice chancellor of 
student affairs, projected very little 
change and was therefore not sur- 
prised by the figures 

"This is only a four to ten per- 
cent decrease," said Borclli 

Borclli attributes much of the 
decrease to the economy. 

"The economy in Allen County 
and the surrounding counties is very 
strong," said Borclli. "Many jobs are 
available, so people choose to work 
more hours Having other options 
defers the beginning or continuing 
of a college education." 

Borelli also said (hat when the 
economy weakens it is common to 
have the enrollment number 
increase. People return to school as a 
result of a weakening economy. 

Although the economy is pros- 
pering, John Springer, freshman, 
feels remaining a full-time student. 
maintaining at least 12 credit hours, 
is important 

"I feel school is important 
because you can"t predict the econo- 
my and the security of jobs in the 
future." said Springer "1 want to 
hurry and finish school." 

The drop in numbers does not 
seem to be an insult for the IPFW 
institution. Borelli says more stu- 
dents transferred in than out this 
semester. 

"The staiislics overlook the fact 
that we have approximately 1,000 
new students this semester. There 
are just a larger number of students 
sitting out," said Carl Zimmerman, 
director of admissions. "The number 
of recruited students is actually up; 
it went up six percent for admitted 
students this semester" 

The retention committee, 



chaired by Marian Zimmerman, 
dean of students, is currently work- 
ing on strategies for keeping stu- 
dents at IPFW, 

"We have 100 people on campus 
working on subcommittees, all of 
which were formed in the last two 
years," said Zimmerman 

Subcommittees are dedicated to 
programs, such as mentoring, orien- 
tation, leadership training, supple- 
mental instruction, academic advis- 
ing and early warning programs 
There has also been a proposal for a 
freshman success pilot that would 
offer a three-credit -hour course in 
study skills and other tips for adjust- 
ing. 

"We're just now establishing 
statislics for our retention rate," said 
Zimmerman. "We've never had one 
before, so it is bard to compare to 
past years." 

The decrease in enrollment is 
measurable. Yet, there are many 
who do not seem to worry. 

"An increase is always some- 
thing we'd like to see though." said 
Borelli.
