ISPGA member attacks senator 



By Not T. Bcckley 
News Edilor 

Tempers flared during Monday's IPSGA meeting 
when IPSGA Internal Affairs axhair Jeffrey VaJdez 
accused Senator Shawn Stanley of lying in ihe Jan. 26 
issue of ihe Communicator. 

"Honor is llie mosi valuable commodiiy any person 
has and [Stanley] has damaged my honor and defamed 
my name," said Valdcz. "I should be allowed lo defend 
myself and (Stanley) has lied about mc and my posi- 
tion," 

In Ihe Jan. 26 issue of ihe Communicalor Stanley 
said, "Valdez is the only one on the Internal Affairs 
commillec; there should have been more people 
iDvolvcd with the decision ." 

Stanley clarified her comments later when she said 
she was lold by someone within the confidence of the 
Inlemal Affairs Committee that the decision not lo send 
SAB member Kerry Adkins" petition, concerning the 
conslilulionality of the technology referendum, was 



reached by Valdez by himself. 

According to Stanley, die other committee members, 
Terry Grimm and David Uchtmaa did not cast votes. 

Uchtman said he did cast a vote against sending 
Adkins' petition to die Judicial Branch of IPSGA. He 
added that be believed Grimm also voted against the 
petition. 

IPSGA President Mark King, unable to attend 
Monday's meeting due lo military reserve obligations. 
said, "I had no idea what was going to happen at the 
meeting. Maybe 1 gave the impression last week that 
my actions were die right way lo acL" 

King felt dismayed by the proceedings and hoped 
that if he was present ai die meeting nothing on this 
scale would have happened 

"I'm disheanencd. Unfortunately the Senate has 
lowered itself lower than I've ever seen. The senate 
showed a total lack of self control," he said. 

Chris Douse, former IPSGA director of multicultural 
affairs, said "(Valdez] has die right to explain himself, 
but it was inappropriate for him lo speak the way be did 



High school students 
take classroom space 



By Mell.s.&lt;ia Young 
Staff Wrlltr 

Recently, the expansion of some 
foreign language classes, especially 
French classes, has lit fires with 
university students. 

Many IPFW students ihis semes- 
ter have been required lo obtain the 
signature of a professor in order to 
register in upper-level language 
classes. 

The conflict occurred when a 
section of French F204 class was 
canceled due lo insufncteni enroll- 
ment and those already enrolled had 
to be moved to another section. 

The university policy of allow- 
ing high school students into col- 
lege classes has become a heated 
debate. Many upperclassmen are 
angry ihat they have had lo wail for 
a class thai they feel should have 
aheady been open to them. 

Marian Zimmerman, dean of stu- 



dents, repoas that she was unaware 
that ihcre was a problem. "1 didn't 
even notice that dicre was a prob- 
lem until 1 received a letter," 
Zimmerman said. 

According to Zimmerman, the 
complaint was filod by ISPGA. The 
complaint stressed the issue of the 
class being overcrowded, and sug- 
gested thai high school students 
regi-sier after freshman. 

IPSGA President King reported 
that he will see the chancellor on 
the mailer and believes that a com- 
promise can be made easily, how- 
ever, his main concern is current 
degree students. 

"I am more worried about pursu- 
ing die interest of the people who 
are here pursuing a degree because 
I work for diem," said King. 

Jeanneiie Clausen, chair of mod- 
era foreign languages, said thai she 
was aware that the problem was 
going to occur, "We knew that ihis

was going lo happen," she said 
"We instructed professors not to 
shut anyone out." 

According to Clausen, it was not 
economically feasible lo expand ihe 
classes any further than they cur- 
rently are. 

Registrar Jack Dahl s^d that the 
one section of F204 had been can- 
celed due lo lack of enrollmenL "A 
high school student who places in 
F204 has qualified for diat through 
a placement test and been recom- 
mended by ihcir high school," Jack 
Dahl, registrar, .said. "At the same 
lime when the complaint first 
reached us, it was about overcrowd- 
ing, but 1 can't see that it jusli- 
ried...for considering it to be over- 
crowded." 

"Some people may find it easy 
to target the high school students, 
when it is clear lhat ihe class bad to 
be dropped due to insufficient 
enrollmenC Dahl said 

Sweet 
Shoppe 
to close 

By Nol T. Beckley 
News Editor 

IPFW will close Walb Sweei 
Shoppe on May 10 as a "cost-saving 
measure" according lo a report 
issued by Judy Clinton, executive 
director of university relations. 

The space will continue as an 
information desk for students and 
visitors. "We will continue most ser- 
vices at existing locaiions." said 
Clinton. 

Georgia Perry, account clerk for 
die Sweet Shoppe, said. "I was told 
by Phil Groic [comptroller for the 
office of financial affairs] thai ihey 
want my salary for odier resources." 

Groie was ilt and unavailable for 



Services affected are ihe FAX 
machine, check cashing, change- 
making, lickcis for the Cinema 
Center. Regal Cinemas and SAB 
events; stamps and Fori Wayne 
Philharmonic Center vouchers. 

Relocating the check cashing ser- 
vice will affect the cafeieria, which 
does nol accept checks, according lo 
Perry. 

"1 doubi many students will walk 
over to Ketder ^om Walb to cash a 
check for money to eai in the cafe- 
ieria." said Perry, 

"It takes another service away 
from ihe students." commented 
Perry, 



during his commitlcc report." Douse immediaicly came 
to Stanley's defense and accused Amy Sieenman, 
IPSGA vice president of legisladon, of noi being able 
to conduct a meeting. 

"} apologize for my behavior, but I fell someone 
should intervene," added Douse, 

During Valdez's committee report, Jerry 
Richardson, IPSGA, director of communication, ques- 
tioned Valdez's motivation for "verbally assaulting" 
Stanley, 

"If this is a campaign speech, lake it oulsidc," 
demanded Richardson, 

Valdez's committee report said that he abhorred 
what had been said about the credibility of his office 
and called Stanley a liar. His report also slated many of 
the philanthropic endeavors of social fraternities at 
IPFW. 

"There was nothing in (Valdez's] committee report 
thai related lo anything within Internal Affairs," said 
Dean of Students, Marian Zimmerman. 

"You cannot always expect professionalism when 



emotions are involved," remarked Zimmerman. 

"What happened was completely unnecessary and 
several people were at fault." said King. 

Richardson said, "It was an unfonunatc situation and 
I hope thai we can pui this behind us and I hope we 
have." 

Uchtman said, "(Valdez's words) arc nol supponed 
by the Iniemal Affairs Commillec. He did ihis on his 
own." 

IPSGA Senator Tan Bui added, "Wc are working 
against each odien I feel embarrassed and upscl." 

Adkins attended Monday's meeting and later said, "I 
think King set a bad example at the last mcctuig. I hope 
(Valdez) will also follow King's example and issue an 
apology lo Stanley." 

Valdez said, "This was an attack on me. I was doing 
my job." 

Valdez was also accused not doing a thorough inves- 
tigation into Adkins' petition.

Center for Women 
and Returning 
Adults gets director 



By Slacy Channell 
Staff Writer 

Catherine Hansman-Ferguson 
became ihc new director of the 
Center for Women and Reluming 
AduluonFeb. 1. 

Hansman-Ferguson replaces 
Linda Johnson, who left IPFW in 
September, 

Currently, Hansman-Ferguson is 
a doctoral assistant at Ball Stale 
and hopes to receive her doctorate 
in May. She taught developmental 
writing at IPFW for four year^. 

Hansman-Ferguson is eager to 
provide services to returning 
adults, whose needs differ from 
those of traditional students, 
Hansman-Ferguson said. Reluming 
adulls generally work full lime jobs 
and have home responsibilities. 

"School is not as easy the sec- 
ond time around and adults need 
someone ihey can (um to." 
Hansman-Ferguson added. 



"The center provides resources 
and referrals to returning adults," 
Hansman-Ferguson said. 

Hansman-Ferguson said she 
would like to create new programs 
focusing on returning adults, but 
available to all students. 

Workshops, such as Reluming 
10 Learning, may be available lo 
returning adults in the near future. 
she said. Another program would 
help students build lasting relation- 
ships with each oUier. This would 
be helpful to returning adults who 
have tight schedules. 

Jerry Richardson, IPSGA 
Director of Communications, said 
he enjoyed working with Linda 
Johnson and is looking forward to 
working with Hansman-Ferguson. 

Richardson also added, "I 
believe a wise choice was made for 
die position." 

In the future, Hansman- 
Ferguson said she would like to 
renun to teaching. 



President 

dissolves 

cabinet 



By Nol T. Beckley 
News Editor 

On Tuesday evening. IPSGA 
President Mark King dissolved 
dircc of bis four cabinet positions 
by executive order. 

King's letter to his former cabi- 
net of Kevin Eads, cxicmal affairs, 
Trish Hogan, interior affairs and 
Chris Douse, multicultural affairs, 
said they would be able to return to 
their former posiLons in IPSGA. 

"1 openly support no one in the 
election; I feel diis election has the 
potential to interfere with day to 
day affairs," said King. 

Monday's IPSGA meeting 
affected King's decision to end the 
short-lived cabinet. King said, 
"Although I wasn't there, once I 
reviewed the minutes, I had visions 
of what the future would be (in the 
IPSGA)." 

'Monday demonstrated bow 
heated the elections will be; King 
wasn't willing to allow it to 
become worse," said Jerry 
Richardson, director of communi- 
cations. 

"I can fmi.sh what 1 want to get 
done faster by my.sclf than if I have 
infighting amongst the IPSGA," 
added King. 

"We don'i want to continue 
infighting because we will lose 
credibility with the students, the 
administration and the state govem- 
mcni," said Richardson. 

"This move by King is an 
attempt to de-politicize the govern- 
ment and the cabinet," said 
Richardson. 

King believes that widi the elec- 
tions for IPSGA President coming 
up in March there would be no way 
to keep his position and cabinet 
free of political conflicL 

Richardson holds the only cabi- 
net position nol terminated. Douse 
will be retained by King as special 
advisor to die pre-sidenl. 

Douse was appointed after 
agreeing to remain neutral during 
the elections. He bad planned to 
tun for IPSGA Vice PresidenL 

Eads intends to run for IPSGA 
President and will serve in the 
IPSGA Senate. 

Eads said, "I will continue work 
on my projects too while serving in 
die senate," 

"I respect die president and bis 
decision to dissolve the cabinet to 
keep it neutral. I don't agree with it 
but I respect iu" said Douse. 

Til continue to work with 
[King] on issues of students of 
color." added Dou.se. 

King said, "(Douse] has come 
up widi a great plan for multicultur- 
al services and I'm happy that I 
won't lose him completely."

Manners important 
for IPSGA members 



Mark King is president of ihc 
IPFW studcni body; iherefore. he 
icpresenLs ihc cnlire student body. 
He should set an cxampte Tor the 
rest of the siudcni govcmmeni and 
roritiercsior the siixlcnl body. He 
has not done this. 

Docs he ihink be is exempt from 
common courtesy because of his 
position? He should bend over 
backward to make sure he is counc- 
ous and rcspcciful of everyone with 
whom he comes in contact, espe- 
cially regarding his function as stu- 
dent body ptesidcnL 

Not only does he need to be 
careful of his actions, he needs to 
be aware of the faa that his person- 
al opinions and his position as stu- 
dent body president arc separate. 
Whether or not he likes a person's 
policies, his reaction should be to 
the actions and not to the individ- 
ual. 

in addition, he needs to make 
sure his actions as student body 
president do not present a possible 
persona] conflict. For example, if 
he and Jeffrey Valdez are close per- 
sonal friends then ihcy should not 
be discussing IPSGA matters if 
there is a polenlial conflict of inicr- 
esl, 

In other words, it would be inapi- 
piopriale for Valdez to talk to King 
about the investigation he was 
doing on Kerry Adkins" proposal if 
King were directly implicated and 
closely involved in the rcrcrendum 
in question. If Valdcz felt he had 
too many personal feelings regard- 
ing the issue then he should have 



Commentary 



abstained from commenting on it. 
Instead he should have let the other 
members of the inicmal affairs 
committee handle the investigation. 

If Valdez were not personally 
involved in the referendum, then he 
would need to make sure that all 
sides were properly represented in 
his investigation. He also would 
need to be sure to consult the other 
members of the committee before 
rendering his opinion to the board. 

Not only did Mark act in an 
inappropriate way, he set a bad 
example for the rest of the senators. 
Despite his example, most people 
would be reasonable enough to fig- 
ure out that personal insulLs are not 
appropriate for student government 
meetings. 

Judging from bis behavior at 
Monday's student senate meeting 
Valdez was obviously not able to 
figure this out on his own. His 
behavior, specifically towards those 
membt^ of the senate with whom 
be disagreed, was completely out of 
context. Not only did he completely 
disregard appropriate rules of con- 
duct, he also let his personal feel- 
ings get in the way of his duties as 
chairman of the internal affairs 
committee. 

At least when Mark King real- 
ized he made a mistake, he correct- 
ed iL Valdez needs to do the same. 

In the future both King and 
Valdez, and all other members of 
student govenunenu need to follow 
appropriate codes of conduct for 
their respective positions. 



You do the math 



At a recent IPSGA meeting, 
IPSGA Senator Jeffrey Valdez dis- 
played complete and utter disre- 
gard for any semblance of order 
when he felt the need to verbally 
attack fellow Senator Shawn 
Stanley. He accused her of being a 
liar and in that process probably 
destroyed any credibility he may 
have had. 

He spoke of honor but dis- 
played nothing that could ever be 
considered honorable. He abused 
bis chair's position to assault 
someone during lime set aside for 
a committee report. Vice President 
Amy Steenman should have cut 
off Valdez's "tirade" immediately. 
Maybe she had no idea that Valdez

NolT, 




Beckley 


I Inly after 
repeated 



requests from IPSGA Director of 
Communications Jerry Richardson 
and IPSGA Director of 
Multicultural Services Chris 
Douse did Steenman end Valdez's 
verbal barrage. To her credit, 
Stanley did not say a word except 
when defending the newspaper 
about the accuracy of her quotes 
and when she gave her committee 
repon. 

Many other people attending 
the IPSGA meeting felt Valdez 
was completely out of bounds in 
his onslaught. At one point, 
Richardson said, "If this is a cam- 
paign speech, lake it outside." I do 
not pretend to know Valdez's polit- 



ical aspirations, but he certainly 
needs to work on his interpersonal 
communication skills. 

The current president has been 
known to name-call within the 
wails of the IPSGA meetings. I 
had always beard "one should lead 
by example," I find calling some- 
one "a fool" a bad example. For 
the record. IPSGA President Mark 
King retracted his words in a writ- 
ten statement, and I respect him 
for doing that. The words still 
were said and they still were 
heard. If Valdez followed King's 
example at the meeting. I hope 
Valdez continues to follow King's 
example and issue a public apolo- 
gy to Stanley. 

At every IPSGA meeting, 
Steenman has a book with the 
rules of parliamenuiry procedure 
in front of her, I suggest that 
Valdez (and hopefully others in the 
IPSGA) should add this book to 
his reading list for this semester. 
Hopefully he will learn some man- 
ners and some sense of leadership. 
Valdez's abuse did not end with 
Stanley: when SAB member Kerry 
Adkins was speaking, Valdcz 
interrupted continually ^d spoke 
condescendingly toward Adkins. 
Valdez showed complete disre- 
spect toward Adkins, Adkins' 
position on the IPSGA floor and 
Adkins' right to be heard, Adkins 
displayed remarkable restraint, and 
I commend him for his civility. 

1 respect V^dez's right to speak 
his mind, but he needs to learn 
how to do it better. He has a long, 
uphill climb to restore his "honor." 
He needs to learn the time and 
place for "personal" attacks are not 
during an IPSGA meeting. He has 
until March 3. when petitions are 
due for IPSGA elections, to restore 
his "credibility." Can he do it? You 
do the math!

Letters to the Editor 



The geese greased 
my assignment sir. 



Is it not enough of an inconve- 
nience 10 have to trudge through 
the pastoral muck of the midlands 
without having to play hop-scotch 
with the cylinders of fowl guano 
sprinkled here and there and just 
about everywhere? Terra coita has 
been soiled sable with bird turd. 
Terra coita has been transubstanti- 
ated into bird turf. Canadian geese 
are the crapping culprits, I do 
deign to believe; many of which 
are lagged with white manacles 
above their webbed feet— no 
doubt to facilitate the Hacking of 
their migralory pallems, as well as 
their flocking and foraging 
manure-isms (neologism mine). 
Canadian geese are the most exot- 
ic feature of wildlife evident in 
Fort Wayne, Indiana, and a mosl 
messy manifestation at that! Not 
even a ten-foot blizzard would 
bury their dross for long. They 
squawk and hobble across the uni- 
versity grounds like mutated pen- 
guins, degenerate and dumb- 
founded that we, the homosapiens 
of the species, should scorn their 
slovenly hygiene, cursing at them 
for their liberal conversion of our 
university grounds into their per- 
sonal pigsty. 
So what? You may say. 

So then, on a personal score, 
these geese were no big ordeal for 



me to contend with, given that the 
sidewalks are kept swept, until a 
covey flew overhead — momentar- 
ily blotting out the solar floes of 
the firmament — and splattered me 
and my freshly printed paper, 
which 1 held in my hands giving it 
a last minute appraisal (laser- 
printed for 10 cents a page, no 
less), with their fecal flak. Then, 
believe me you. it got personal! 
First off I raised my fisLs toward 
the firmament in retaliation and 
shouted "YOU ABOMINABLE 
BUZZARDS!" After this venUla- 
Qon of what I felt lo be a worth- 
while ejaculation of vindictive 
wrath, I look stock of the damage 
done to me and mine. Spackted 
from head lo loe with guano was 
what I was, with guano sticking 
like gum in my hair and, worse 
yet. with dysenteric guano bleed- 
ing into the parchment of my 
meticulously prepared paper. So 
my assignment was soiled and 
given the pressing imminence of a 
three of clock class (currently 
being 2:55 p.m), I found myself 
in a considerable pickle. 

So what did 1 say, a lowly 
pupil, to save my face in front of 
the omniscient professor? "The 
geese greased my assignment, sir. 
Care to see?"

this statement disturbed me. but 
after careful consideration, my ini- 
tial response was precocious. After 
taking the time to read between the 
lines of the comment, I discovered 
that such a statement was actually a 
compliment in disguise and should 
be viewed as such by all members 
of the Greek system on this cam- 
pus. Such a comment, no matter 
under what pretense it was made, 
says to the students and faculty of 
this campus that the Grx^k system 
on this campus likes lo be involved 
within their university. It lets peo- 
ple know ihat the Greek systems 
here care about the operation and 
longevity of IPFW. Out of 11.000 
or more students on this campus, to 
have an individual recognize this 
fact, no matter how they them- 
selves perceive it. should be looked 
upon as an accomplishment by all 
members of the Greek system.

Homosexually Speaking: 

Romance needed in relationships 



usually write to cater to the 
community, but I think even 
you breeders may get something 
out of this one. I want to talk 
about romance, and the lack of it 
in today's society. Clearly the 
most romantic movie of this last 
year. Love Affair, was a big fail- 
ure at the box office, and I think it 
is because many of us have lost 
touch of

romance 
means. 
Romance 
can be as big 
as you want, 
or as small 
as you need. 
Romance 
Paul d e s n ■ I 

1 upper always mean 

spending excessive amounts of 
money on material things. Simple 
words or actions can be all the 
romance that is needed to keep 
the sparks alive. Most of all. 
romance is about surprise, 

I don't have any research on 
the decline of romance in hetero- 
sexual dating, but 1 have heard 
from a few of my straight friends 
that romance is a dying art I can 
safely say that in the gay commu- 
nity, especially with ihe men. 
romance is alive and well. 

If you plan to go to dinner lo 
celebrate, go someplace that you 
don't usually go. If you can, go 
to a place that is more riuy than 
the usually Saturday night Pizza 
HuL Fort Wayne is full of won- 
derful, romantic restaurants. If 
money is an issue, make a special 
dinner with candlelight and soft 
background music. Can't cook? 
Then get a simple recipe from 
anywhere. It's not what you 
make, it's that you prepared it out 
of love and went the extra mile to 
make it romantic. 

If you are more of a gift per- 
son, then have a gift made with 
both of your names engraved or 
sewn on it. Personalize the gift. 



Go to ahnost any card shop and 
personally make the card you 
want saying what you want to say. 
Don't be afraid to put the year on 
it to remember that certain occa- 
sion. A wonderful gift to give is a 
seating at any studio to have your 
ponrail taken together. 

With St. Valentine's Day next 
week, many of you are probably 
scurrying to find the perfect gift 
or floral arrangement to send to 
your love. My first suggestion is 
to be creative, If you want to 
send roses, great! Bui send them 
to your companion's place of 
work, or even to their classroom. 
It's not only great to receive flow- 
ers, but it's even belter when there 
is a group of people around you to 
watch in jealousy as your face is 
red with shock. Be creative with 
the flowers you send. If blue is 
the favorite color of your mate, 
then send carnations. Roses may 
not always be what will surprise 
them. 

My second suggestion b to lis- 
ten to your lover. Know them 
and, most importantly, listen to 
them, and the best gift will be 
plainly obvious. Maybe roses and 
candy are not appealing. Sure, 
you look romantic giving them, 
but honing in on what they really 
want is that much more romantic. 

For the ultimate romantic 
event, find the best song that rep- 
resents your feeling for this per- 
son. Dim the lights and slowly 
dance in your own living room. 
Find, or even better, write a poem 
to express your feelings. 
Something from the heart is 
always a heart-stealer. 

If romance is difficult for you, 
then think. It just takes a little 
thought and effort to accomplish 
romance. And don'i feel thai if 
you miss Valentine's Day you 
miss the chance at romance. 
Every day can be a romantic day. 
A national holiday is not needed 
to freely express your love to that 
special someone.

one win and one toss. 

The Lady "Dons defeated KWU in ihe Tint game, 
67-58. 10 improve to 3-5 in Ihc GLVC. The Lady 
Pumas dropped to 2-6. 

IPFW jumped oul lo a big lead in the first half and 
led by nine at the half, 34-25. They used that lead in (he 
second half lo crui.sc to ihe win. 

The Lady 'Dons jumped on KWU early as the Lady 
Pumas lumed the ball over four limes in the Hnt three 
minutes. At the 12:18 mark. IPFW led 12-6 and ran off 
Ihe nenl seven poinLs to lead by 13 wilh nine minutes 
left in the fu^t half. The Lady 'Dons stole ihe ball six 
times in thai span. 

"We've had this problem in the past, as far as play- 
ing 40 hard minuies," said Lady Pumas coach Michele 
Rupc. 

From ihat point. IPFW u.scd its momentum lo stay 
ahead and win the game. Hie Lady 'IXms kept the lead 
at double digits thioughoui ibc resi of ihc half, record- 
ing its biggest lead. 30-16. with 3:18 left in the half. 

Rupe said. They answered every lime we made an 
ai tack... (they) answered with one of their own." 

IPFW came out of the locker room ready to play and 
kept a double-digit lead for most of the first nine min- 
utes. Then the Lady Pumas closed the gap to four, 52- 
48, with 7:21 remaining, and again. 54-50, at 6:54. 

Guard Lindy Jones led five double-figure scorers for 
Ihc Lady 'Dons with 18 points. Nobody on the IPFW 
bench scored as the team tut 5 1 percent of its field-goal 
attempts. The Lady "Dons also hit 23-of-26 free-throw 
attempts 

Jill Bumess led KWU with 17 points, but only one 
other player, who hit four of 15 field-goal atlempLs. 
scored in double figures for ihe Lady Pumas. Bumess 
also collected a game-high 10 rebounds. 

Tie men's team spotted the Pumas a 12-3 lead less 
than three minutes into the game, and could never quile 
return from the hole. The 'Dons spotted KWU a 49-44 
half-lime lead en route to a 96-91 loss which dropped 
ibem 10 3-5 in the conference. 

For eight minutes, both teams settled in for a fast- 



paced game which KWU began to take over with six 
minutes left in Ihe half. Leading 35-30, the Pumas 
scored the nexl five points lo take its first double-digil 
lead. 

However. Russ Marcinek began a 9-2 Mastodon run 
with ihe team's fifth three-pointer of the half, and 
IPFW pulled within Oiree. 42-39. 

The second half started with more bump- and- grind 
action as both teams traded fouls and free throws, 
KWU leading 46-51. Then the Pumas threatened to 
pull away with a six-point run capped by forward Peier 
Van Altena's dunk before Jason Werhng made another 
of IPFW's 12 total three-pointers. 

The 'Dons continued to knock on the door for the 
rest of the game, spoiling KWU leads between two and 
eight points. Piazza said, "We've tried lo lalk to our 
kids abouL..we just want to bang around.,.look for us to 
pick our spots." 

With a minute left in the game, Ihe Pumas led 88-84 
after another three-pointer by Wcrling. but then were 
forced to foul to stop KWU from using the clock. The 
Pumas' lasi six points were scored at Ihe line. 

The 'Dons missed two free throws and fouled four 
limes in that span before center Ryan Bond made a lay- 
up at the buzzer, 

All-Amcrican candidate Willis Cheaney led five 
Pumas in double figures with 25 points on 8-of-12 
field-goal shooting. Forwards Kenny (jreen and Van 
Altena added 18 and 16, respectively. KWU shot 35 
free throws and made 26. 

Rafe Young, a serious three-point threat, was held lo 
12 points on 3-of-12 field-goals shooting. Stated 
Piazza, "We did a pretty good job on him. but, ..you 
can't let Cheaney go crazy." 

The 'Dons were led by guard Ryan Glidden wiih 25 
points, including 15 from long range, and Bond, who 
hii 7 field goals out of 12 attempts to go with a game- 
high 12 rebounds. 

The Pumas clawed IPFW on the boards, 44-29, and 
.shot 20 more free throws. 

"Fhe frustrating thing is one of our goals was to do a 
better job on rebounding this week than we did last 
week,, ..they crucified us on the boards.. ..that can't hap- 
pen." Piazza said. KWU had 16 offensive rebounds. 

The 'Dons lumed ihe ball over only nine limes and 
hit 48 percent from direc-point range.

In search of ... 
the best salsa sauce 



By Kan Whidng 
Fealuref tailor 

Oh dear, ihis week 1 had no idea 
whal I was going write for my "In 
search of..," ariicle. 1 liicrnlly went 
10 ihc grocery siore nol knowing 
whai I was going to buy. The firsi 
aisle I wnlkcd down was ihc sali^ 
aisle. And then ibis lighi bulh went 
off in my head and I said "Ah-ha, 
iJiis will be a great '\n search of,.."' 
So. my friends, wc will be talking 
saJsa/picanie sauce for the next few 
paragraphs. 

Tbe brands that I tried were 
Chi-Chi's. Old El Paso. Taco Bell. 
Hum's and Pace. All brands were 
tastc-testcd in mild, and the rating 
system for this week was based on 
tortilla chips. 

CHI-CUl'S 

This salsa is good if you like il 
chunky and a little runny. But, for a 
mild salsa, it was also pretty spicy, 
at least for my taste buds. And for 
16-ounce jar, you will pay S2.19. 
Unfortunately, there arc a few 
problems that 1 have with this 
salsa. First of all, the jar itself is 
not big enough to dip a whole tor- 
tilla chip. Secondly, there was no 
nutritional value information 
given, and I feel that that is very 
important. So I cannot tell you how 
many grams of fat you arc consum- 
ing, what a pity! Well, to cut this 
one short. I am giving this salsa 
three chips out of a possible four. 
OLD EL PASO 

This stuff is good! The salsa 
itself was nice, chunky, thick And 
looked more appealing than any of 
the others that I tried. Again, 
though, the problem was ibe jar 



itself. Dipping your chip into the ever could have wanted. 

jar will be a problem, so get a plate But this did not live up to the 

or a bowl out, even if you are eat- Taco Bell standard, in my estima- 




This week's victims of the ''In search of..." test.

ing out of tbe fridge. This salsa 
cost $2.25 for a 16-ounce jar. And 
again, no nutritional value infor- 
mation was available on the jar. 
For a final rating of three-and-a- 
half chips out of four, I highly rec- 
ommend this salsa. 

TACO BELL 

I thought this salsa would be 

better than it really was. 1 was 

expecting so much more than I 



Generation X's feeble 
attempt to "Save our show" 



MclksQ Young 
Surr Writer 

Our Generations X friends on 
the West Coast launched a "Save 
our Show" campaign to save their 
beloved "My So-Called Life." 
There is even a "Save Our Show" 
flic on the Internet. So naturally I 
thought maybe the same phenome- 
non holds true here. There can't be 
that much difference between 
sunny California and Arctic north- 
east Indiana? Right? RigbL 

So I set off on my quest to find 
fans of "My So-Called Life." I 
journeyed down the student union 
steps to the big screen TV room 
and found some unsuspecting prey. 

I sealed myself next to the two 
gentlemen and point-blank asked 
Ihem, "Have you seen 'My So- 
Called Life?'" Of course, they 
answered no. My bean sank, but I 
was quick to rebound. 1 bobbed 
down the next flight of stairs to the 
basement and entered tbe pool 
room, where I found yet another 
set of helpless prey. 

At 1 found someone who appre- 
ciated our western friends' an. Not. 
I was dizzed (slang) yet again. 
Although i did get an opinion 

Mike Licia told me with vigor 
that the show was about "a stupid 
Uttle adolescent girl going through 
high school. It is a teenage soap 
opera." 

Granted it was not the quote 1 
was looking for, but, hey, it was an 



opinion. Next, I ventured out to the 
lounge chairs by tbe staircase. I 
found two nice women who a had 
only watched the show a few times 
and basically stopped watching for 
the reasons my pool buddy Mike 
doesn't watch. "I think that is why 
I don't like it: because it is a soap 
opera," Melaine Moorehead said. 

She did, however contend that 
calling the program stupid 
siretcbcd the truth. "It's stupid and 
teeny I don't Uiink I'd go that far," 
she continued. 

Feeling pretty happy about my 
accomplishment (hey, at least I 
found two living and breathing 
souls who had seen the show), 1 set 
out to the dining area. I approach 
two chatting women who didn't 
have anything to say but directed 
me to their friend, a big fan of our 
spotlighted show I might add, who 
was sealed across the way. 

Trotting across the room with 
my head held high. 1 approached 
her. Busted. I had intenupled her 
study group for a big macrobiology 
test that was to occur later than 
afternoon. 1 felt really bad. 

My quest was now ruined. My 
spirit crushed. My fun search for 
rioting .souls to save their show was 
no longer fun. 1 now retired. 1 had 
failed my mission. There goes my 
promotion from gumshoe to Jr. 
Detective. I guess sunny California 
and arctic Indiana don't have quite 
as much in common as 1 once 
thought

tlon. Tbe salsa itself was thin, very 
mild, not very chunky, not really 
much of anything at all. It seems 
after careful thought, (but not loo 
careful), that the so-called salsa 
that Taco Bell claims to produce is 
actually just their taco sauce in a 
jar. The nice thing about this was 
the packaging. One could dip one's 
chip in the Jar if one chose lo do 
so. And to be honest, what struck 



me funny was the price: S2.19 for a 
16-ounce jar. What? S2.19 from 
the same people who sell a 59 cent i 
taco? This just doesn't work for ' 
me. So. as a result the Taco Bell 
brand salsa gets two chips out of 
four. 

BUKrs 

First of all, I just want to say 
that these people should stick to 
ketchup. The taste was very toma- 
toey and gross all together This is 
not a salsa sauce. 1 have yet to 
decide what exactly this is. but 1 do 
know it is nol a salsa. Therefore I 
cannot go on anymore. But, these 
people did give a nutritional value. 
So in case you are in the market for 
a ketchup with a salsa label, you 
will consume 10 calories and no 
grams of fat for every two table- 
spoons of salsa. Without much fur- 
ther ado, this suedo-salsa receives 
one chip out of four. 
PACX 

This may be made in San 
Antonio, but as far as salsa sauces 
go this was too sweet and too 
runny. And the chunks of real veg- 
gies were no where to be found. 
This was the other brand that 
offered nutritional value informa- 
tion. For two tablespoons of salsa 
il is 10 calories and, again, a fai- 
free sauce. But the dipability of the 
jar itself is not very good. 1 could 
barely fit the comer of my chip 
into this Jar. Oh well, belter luck 
next time. The jar that I did pick up 
only had eight ounces and cost 
S1.39. So to wrap this up. Pace 
receives one chip out of four. 



Editor's picks 
the week 



By Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

This week's pick for a book 
to pick up and read is that clas- 
sic early eighties novel by Bret 
Ellis, "Less than Zero." This 
novel is considered the "Catcher 
in the Rye" of the eighties. This 
is an excellent novel. 

This week's pick for a movie 
10 see is "Demon Night." This 
film has a very interesting story- 
line and Billy Zanc makes the 
film. Go see this film immedi- 
ately. 



This week's pick for a movie 
to rent is the all-time classic 
film "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." 
All I can say is. "let my 
Cameron go." I love this movie! 

The CD of the week is Toad 
the Wet Sprocket's Acoustic 
Dance Party, This CD only has 
five songs, but keeps that MTV 
unplugged acoustic sound alive. 
For under $7, this CD is great 
because it covers some of the 
old songs we all know and love 
that these guys from Atlanta 
sing for us.

Hots/The Classroom: 
The Fort Wayne bar 
scene search continues 




By Paul Tripper 
Features Writer 

In searching for the mosi colic- 
glalc bar. last week I visited 
Columbia Street West, and was 
pretty satisfied with whal I found. 
This week, 1 went lo HOTS. ITiey 
arc Classroom, one of ihe many 
bars of the Pierc's enienainmeni 
complex. If there are iwo bars thai 
are compleieiy opposile of each 
other, Columbia Street and HOTS 
are ihey. Dolh bars credit their 
patrons for the establishment's 
success, but Ihe similarilies end 
iberc. 

Whereas Columbia Sueet con- 
siders itself laid back. HOTS is a 
meal markel. TIk first but not the 
last person lo icll me this wa.s bar- 
tender and IPFW freshman Greg 
Freed, a major in mcdianical engi- 
neering. Love can be found on any 
given night, be it permanent or 
temporal^. But Greg also feels 
thai many people go to HOTS 
because of Ihe dance music thai 
dominates Ihe play list. 

With this in mind, I decided to 
chat with Ihe two disc jockey's 
Jeff Furncy (J.J.) and Brian 
Strahm (XTC). What i found was 
two guys who arc the real reason 
for the bars "Lei's Pump Ii" 
atmosphere. Fumey, who used to 
be a jockey for WDJB106.3, has 
access to song remixes weeks 
before Ihey are made lo the pub- 
lic. Whal comes out of the speak- 
ers is a fresh, infective groove of 
rap, hip hop, and techno that is 
hard to resist. But even if you 
don't like ihe music, just watch- 
ing Fumey and Slratun in the DJ 
booth can put you in a party 
mood. 

For those of you who would 
rather hang to alternative and 
modem rock music, like HOTS' 
besi bartender. John 

Weisenburger, a senior majoring 
in management and personnel, 
check out Wednesday nights. 

Music not your thang? How 
about a round of golf? Yes. golf! 
Inside HOTS, there is a con^lete 
game room in the back, called 
The Classroom, with everything 
from a pool table to video games. 
New to The Classroom is virtual 
reality spons. where you can play 
full games of golf or baseball 
v/ilhout leaving the bar. 

On Friday nights, celebrities 
from WDJB 106.3 are in the 
house to add to the party. 1 am a 
big fan of B106, but the night I 
wem to HOTS, Rick Hummer and 
Bobby Elliot were Hlling in for 
Flash and Trip, Ihe real stars of 
Ihe station. Although I found 
these guys fuimy, I am relieved lo 
know that Flash and Trip will 
retum soon. Rick and Bobby did 
not seem like they wanted to be 
there and only were because, and 
! quote Rick, "because we are get- 
ting paid." Not what I would call 
a party attimde. 

The waiting slaff were also 
quite friendly. Cindi Miller, my 
official tour guide and HOTS 
waitress, was very courteous and 
helpful. She believes thai HOTS 
is more like "a family" becau.se of 
the regulars who come frequently. 
For Cindi. Ihe desire to parly, and 
evennjally work at HOTS began 
when she was a minor and 
"everyone talked about it" 

Whal do you do if you like 
both the "laid back" atmosphere 
of Columbia Street and the 
"dance 'till you can't dance no 
more" energy of HOTS? Ask 
Shawn Neumann, a senior manag- 
ing in business marketing. 
Shawn's solution is lo go to 
Columbia Street on Fridays and to 
HOTS on Saturday's. 

Overall, 1 bad a good time at 
HOTS. The energy in the air is 
very sexual and effective. But ilie 
goal here is to find the most colle- 
giate bar, and so far Columbia 
Street is iL But a good lime can 
be had at HOTS and I'm sure to 
be back there some time soon.

bave become more of a leam. *c work

lion of (he conference. I Ihink we will

W. IPFW spoiled USI leads of 17-8 and 
37-28 and ended (he first half four 
points behind. 45-41. IPFW coach

well, and Ibe game was closer than (he 
scores suggested 

The 'Dons came back strong to 
t^gin the second half with two lay-ups, 



and a R&gt;an Gbdden Ihree-poini shot (i 



lake a 



e-poin' 



into the second half. The (earns fought a

VoUeydons sweep 
three MIVA matches 



By S. Brant Kelky 
Gdllor-in-Chler 

On January 27, the IPFW 
VoUeydons hosted Ihe University of 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) 
Panthers and won 15-8, 13-8, 15-12 
to even its record lo 1-1. 

The VoUeydons jumped out on 
UWM early, recording a 34 percent 
kill effectiveness Ihrougbout Ihe 
malcli compared lo irWM's 17 per- 
cent. 

The Panthers leaped to a 5- 1 lead 
in the third game before the 
VoUeydons look control and 
oulscored U\VM IJ-7 tlie resi of the 
way, IPRV coach Amic Ball said he 
made all but one player jump serve 
during the third game, and the players 
aren'l confident with the jump serve 
yet. 

"I thoughl il would be more diffi- 
euli tlian ihat," said Ball, referring to 
Ihe lopsided match score. He added 
the VoUeydons displayed bctler serv- 
ing than they did the previous week- 
end; IPFW recorded 13 service errors. 
Several of those were in Ihe third 
game when Ball invoked ihe jump 
serve rcquiremcni for his players, 

"They didn't pass serve very 
well," Boll slated about the Panthers. 
The VoUeydons served nine service 
aces. 

Outside hitler Craig Collins led 
IPFW wilh 19 kiUs. Felipe Ralal and 
Ricardo Soler added 15 and 10, 
rcspocUvely, Seller Scott Lauer con- 
tributed 52 assists. 

Nick Momcilovic led the Panthers 
with 1 1 kills and reserve Greg Hinkle 



added 10 on a 44 percent kill efncicn- 
cy in two games. 

UWM served nine errors, and 
loialed 39 assists in lowering its 
record lo 4-2, 1-1 in Ihe Midwestern 
Collegiate Volleyball Association. 

On Jan. 28, Ihe VoUeydons trav- 
eled lo Thomas More College (TMC) 
in Crestview Hills, Ky. for a two 
match set against the Sainis. IPFW 
won the two matches by a combined 
score 90-37 in six games to drop 
TMC's record to 0-8. 

When asked whal the VoUeydons 
need to improve on. he replied Uicy 
need lo avoid the unforced errors and 
improve their middle blocking.

-1 was never called before Ihe 
Internal Affairs Commiltee." said 

Valdez said that be and the commil- 
tee looked into Adkins' petition and 
found no credibiliiy in il and therefore 
rejected the pe(i(ion. 

Valdez told Adkins. "1 looked into 
all your lidle points and found no 
grounds to yourclaims." 

Valdez also was offended by the 
Stanley's reference to IPSGA President 
Mark King being Valdcz's campaign 
manager for IPSGA piesidenl in Ihc 
upcoming elections. 

Stanley said in ihe Jan. 26 
Communicator, "(King] is going to be 
Valdcz's campaign manager for the 
forthcoming IPSGA presidential elec- 
tion." She said that she was told by an 
informed source ibai King would be in 



thai capacity for (he elections. 

Stanley said. "This wasn'i an office 
rumor going around IPSGA. I heard il 
from a very high posiiion," 

"I have never approached King and 
he has never approached me on (hat 
mailer." Valdez said 

King said, "I wish him all (be luck 
in the world, bui I couldn't run his 
campaign and run the govcrnmen( a( 
the same time." 

Uchtman said that no has even peti- 
tioned to be on the ballot and (bat no 
one can until March 3. 

"It appears (he election is going (o 
become bloody: we've (Tied to restore 
credibihty lo student government and 1 
don'I want one election lo destroy it 
all," said King. 

Valdez also demanded a retraction 
from Stanley. 

Stanley responded, "I will not give a 
retraction; I stand by what I said in the
