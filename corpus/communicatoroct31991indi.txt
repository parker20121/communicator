Youth group provides 
social support for gays 



By Jim Walker 
Managing Editor 

A newly formed educalional 
support group for gay and lesbian 
youlhs held ils firsl meeting ihis 
week. 

Fort Wayne resldenl Jim Cafes 
spear-headed the effort to bring 
the Indianapolis Youlh Group, a 
statewide organization for gay 
and lesbians under 21, to his 
home town. 

IYG has five chapters currently 
operating in Indiana and three 
more are in developmental 
stages, according to Cates. The 
organization was lounded three 
years ago in Indianapolis. , 

Cates said the objectives of IYG 
are clear. "Our primary goal is 
education. We wani to help 
reduce at-risk infection. The best 
way to do this is to alter their 
social groups." 

Cafes said IYG serves as a new 
social group tor ils members, and 
the members will all be educated 
on sate sex practices, "it some- 
one is 20 years old and Iheir 
social group does not practice 
safe sex, then they are not likely 
to practice safe sex. This is 
where we implemenl our primary 
goal. We provide a social group 
who practices abstinence or safer 



sex." 

IYG does more than educate, it 
can also serve as a supporl 

group for self-identified homosex- 
uals, Cates said. He also noted 
lhat established chapters like the 
one in Indianapolis offer social 
events such as group outings 
and community activities. 

The meetings are open to 
everyone but the location is kept 
confidential To learn about the 
meeting times and locations. 
interested sludents should call 1- 
800-347-TEEN. the IYG gay and 
lesbian hotline. 

Cales said callers are screened 
io keep IYG the way il is 
designed. The meetings are for 
people who have decided on a 
sexual preference. We don't 
wani people who are struggling 
wilh their sexual identities 
because we aren't designed to 
help with that.' 

Cales said his group also 
screens about potentially disrup- 
tive homophobic individuals.

Michael Foot 

British Parliamentarian discusses 
state of United Kingdom at IPFW 



By Chad Hestlng 
Features Editor 

Michael Foot, British Labour Party 
leader, spoke at IPFW Sept. 24 on 
such issues as the worldwide reces- 
sion and the Thatcher legacy. Ninety 
persons attended the hour and a half 
address. 

Foot has had a distinguished career. 
He has spent 41 years serving in (he 
British Parliament. Foot established 
himself as a Labour Party leader by 
taking the role of compromiser of the 
Labour Parly's socialist traditions with 
the establishment of liberal politics of 
Labour's right wing. He served the last 
Labour government, the 1976 
through1979 Callaghan term as deputy 
prime minister. Foot became leader of 
the opposition in I960, and would have 
served as prime minister had Labour 
been victorious over Margaret Thatch- 
er's Conservatives in the 1983 election. 

Foot has also worked as editor of the 
London Evening Standard and The Tri- 
bune, as well as penning a regular col- 
umn for the London Daily Herald. He is 
also a recognized literary authority, 
having written texts on the works of 
Byron and Paine. Fool is the author of 
two major biographies of Labour lead- 
ers Harold Wilson and Aneurin Bevan. 

IPFW political science prolessor 
Gerald Houseman introduced Foot to 
the audience. He opened his remarks 
by speaking at length on Bevan. Bevan 
was Foot's political mentor and Iriend 



in the early years ol Foot's career. Foot 
also represents Bevan's old parliamen- 
tary constituency, that ol Slaenau 
Gwent. in Wales. 

"Had he (Sevan) been chosen leader 
ol our parly, it might well have meant a 
prolound change of direction for our 
nation," said Foot. He recognized 
Bevan as the prime architect of 
Britain's Nalional Health Service. Fool 
spoke of the program's resilience, not- 
ing that Ihe physicians' community lhat 
opposed the Health Service in the 
1950s are now acting to counter Con- 
servative Party efforts to chip away at 
established portions ol Ihe service. 
"The National Health Service program 
Is on too strong a foundation Io be 
swept away by shifting winds of politi- 
cal change," he assened. 

Foot ottered strong criticism of the 
policies of the Thalcher government. 
He claimed that the recenl Newcastle 
riots were like Ihe violent Liverpool and 
Brixton riots ai the turn of Ihe last 
decade. The Scarmon-commillee 
investigating of the two latter outbreaks 
fed to a report examining Iheir roots. 
The new Thatcher government refused 
to heed Iheir explanation. Foot said, 
and the same racial and unemploy- 
ment woes were Ihe cause of Ihe New- 
castle disturbances. He predicted, "A 
further examination by Lord Scarmon 
would lead to the election results I feel 
are going to happen anyway." 

Foot staled lhal Britain's current eco- 




Turtle research leads to insight on dinosaurs 



By Tammy Rasnlck 
News Editor 

An IPFW biology professor's 
research of lurtles has shed light on 
part ol ihe unsolved mystery of 
dinosaurs. 

Frank Paladino. associate professor 
ol biological sciences. has 
researched leatherback turtles, the 
largest reptile alive today, for four 
years. The research was done in 
Costa Rica where the turtles were 
observed and Iheir metabolic rates 
were measured. Specially designed 
masks were placed over Ihe turtles' 



heads, collecting exhaled breath for 
analysis and calculation of energy 
requirements. The test provided infor- 
mation about what the lurtles needed 
to live. 

Paladino said, "Wa now have infor- 
mation on the caloric needs for the 
entire size of these lurtles. We will be 
able to use this information in compar- 
ative studies wilh other marine ani- 
mals, and these dala should provide 
us with insights on jusi where and 
what Ihese lurtles need io survive." 

The turtles are equipped with satel- 
lite transmitters on their shells that 



trace iheir movements. The same lur- 
tles have been traced from Newfound- 
land all the way down lo Costa Rica. 
Paladino found that the leatherback 
could live in 45 degree water, yet 
could sustain a body temperature of 
77 degrees. 

The results of ihe metabolic testing 
revealed that the leatherback's 
metabolism is three limes higher than 
that of other large reptiles. 

The research yielded a new term, 
"Giganlolhermy." Il accounts for the 
turtle's ability lo maintain its body tem- 



perature. The term and Ihe research 
behind il were profiled in Discover 
magazine, and Ihe term itself will be 
included in the 1991 Encyclopedia Bri- 
tanntea. 

Paladino's research has settled ihe 
controversy among dinosaur biolo- 
gists. II is now agreed thai large rep- 
tiles could have survived in cold envi- 
ronments. Evidence exists that 
dinosaurs lived in both Ihe North Pole 
and Souih Pole and the new Informa- 
tion Paladino has researched about 
reptile energetics explains how this is 
possible. 



nomlc slump came as the resuft of Ihe 
Thatcher inaction as well. Only new 
North Sea oil revenues have kept the 
United Kingdom Irom sinking into eco- 
nomic disaster during two dilferent 
recessions in the 1980s, and he rec- 
ommended "common deflationary mea- 
sures* to weaken recessions in the 
future. Foot reminisced about post-war 
governments striving tor full national 
employment and praised lhat as a goal 
for ihe 1990s. "The popular opinion in 
Britain is lhat the employment figures 
of seven, eight years ago should have 
never recurred, " he claimed. 

When questioned Foot 
demurred on advising 
Americans on tow issues 
of his opinion, that "the 
less guns people have 
around, the better. " 

As for abortion, Foot 
proclaimed his "skepti- 
cism of the way abortion 
arguments were handled 
here, " claiming that the 
Supreme Court "Had 
dodged the matter. " 

Foot closed his speech by fielding 
several questions from the audience. A 
query about the Northern Ireland inde- 
pendence issue found Fool agreeing 
wilh Ihe efforts ol the Conservative 
Major government. He slated flatly lhal 
the opposition supports the ongoing 
talks between Britain and the North 
Irish independence movement. Fool 
held that if the majority of Northern Ire- 
land voted to slay in the United King- 
dom, they should remain so. He called 
Iroop withdrawal "a grave mistake." 

When questioned, Foot demurred on 

Foot stated that Britlan's 
current economic slump 
has come as the result of 
Thatcher in action. Only 
new North Sea oil rev- 
enues have kept the U.K. 
form sinking into eco- 
nomic disaster during 
tow different recessions 
in the 80;, and he recom- 
mended "common defla- 
tionary measures" to 
weaken recessions in the 
f uture. 

advising Americans on two issues of 
controversy here - gun conirol and 
abortion. He was willing, however, lo 
slate his opinion, lhat Ihe less guns 
people have around, the better." 

As for abortion. Fool proclaimed his 
"skepticism of the way abortion argu- 
ments are handled here," claiming lhal 
the Supreme Court "had dodged Ihe 
matter." 

Foot planned one more speaking 
engagement, in Bloominglon, before 
returning lo the United Kingdom later 
Ihis monlh. 



Engineering students earn experience by building gazebo 



By Marc Jernlgan 
Staff Writer 

Soon there will be a new feature 
added to Aquarius park. The feature is 
to be a gazebo-type pavilion, placed 
just west of Walb Memorial Union. 

Malhew Kubik, associate professor of 
civil and architectural engineering tech- 
nology, is heading the development ol 
Ihe pavilion, while the construction and 
detailed planning are being handled by 
students. According to Kubik there are 
two sludenl groups developing the 
pavilion. Associated Builders and Con- 
tractors and American Institute ol 
Architecture Students. The idea for the 
project. Kubik said, came directfy from 
Chancellor Lantz. Kubik said Lantz's 
dream was to have the pavilion in from 
ol Aquanus park; lhal way the pavilion 
would have the gardens of the park as 
a backdrop. 

According lo Kubik. the pavilion is lo 



be roughly 600 square feet. He also 
said Ihe plans include a deck lo sur- 
round the maid body. Including the 
deck the pavilion will be 28 feel by 28 
feel. According to Kubik, Ihe pavilion 
will have a concrete foundation while 
the resi of the structure will be made 
out of heavy timber. 

One of the more subtle features of the 
pavilion, Kubik said, will be a time cap- 
sule. The contents will be placed 
inside a clear globe nestled up in the 
root, but visible Irom inside the pavilion. 
Kubik said they are taking donations for 
things lo put in the globe, but objects 
must fit through the hole ol the globe. 

According to Kubik. development of 
the project has gone well. He said, 'I 
have been astounded by the level of 
cooperation and enthusiasm from the 
students, laculty and especially the 
Physical Plant." 

This weekend volunteer students are 



going to be building the frame of the 
pavilion, with the rest lo be built over 
Ihe fall break, Oct. 10 through 13, dur- 
ing a "barn-raising." According lo 
Kubik, Thursday, Oct. 10, Lantz herself 
"will be out hammering nails." He also 
said lhat throughout Ihe construction 
pehod refreshments will be provided by 
Lantz. 

Kubik said after he drew Ihe sketches 
the students took over developing the 
project Irom lhal point. Kubik said lhat 
Ed Costetlo and Tim Gerig drew the 
working drawings, while Brad Hitzfield, 
a senior and president of Associated 
Builders and Contractors, handled 
material estimates, material take-offs 
and organized Ihe volunteer manpow- 
er. Hrtzfield said the material take-offs 
are the itemized lists ot materials that 
will be needed to construct the pavilion. 
Hitzlield stated thai the biggest prob- 
lem he had was getting the concrete 



delivered on a day that the student vol- 
unteers could be there lo pour it. He 
said that the concrete coukfnl be deliv- 
ered on a Saturday, so the sludents 
had lo do the pouring on a Wednesday. 
Both Hitzlield and Kubik gave Don Kat- 
ter, head of the Physical Plant, credit 
tor helping this projeel along. The 
Physical Plant has been responsible for 
material purchases, lending extra tools, 
and digging the holes for the founda- 
tion 

Kubik said lhat after he drew up the 
preliminary sketches, he presented the 
idea to The Friends ol the University. 
The Friends of Ihe University are a 
group of people "interested in the well 
being ot Ihe University." The Friends 
of the University agreed to fund Ihe 
project under one condition: Construc- 
tion of the pavilion must be done by 
volunteer students, Kubik said this is 
where [he project ran into the only real 



problem so far. Kubik said typically the 
University doesnl have students volun- 
teering to do construction, so there was 
no insurance for the volunteers. 
According to Kubik, West Lafayette 
agreed there was a need so the Uni- 
versity picked up accidental death and 
dismemberment insurance. 

The pavilion has been designed to be a 
multifaceted building, Kubik said. He 
said one main feature of the pavilion is it 
will have electricrty, enabling the building 
lo be equipped with lights. Kubik said the 
building will be ideal for holding concerts 
and outdoor plays. He continued by stal- 
ing not only is the size of Ihe pavilion 
good for plays and concerts, there is a 
slight rise in the ground toward one end 
of the pavilion. He said this gives the 
pavilion a slight amphitheater effect. 
According to Kubik. the uses for the 
pavilion are numerous, including outdoor 
class meetings and weddings.

Insecurity 

Men need to know that 
women aren't the enemy 

The last month has seen the establishment ot a women's studies 
major at IPFW. The University has finally seen its way clear to 
acknowledge that the society of women is worthy of committed 
study. Working within a more individualized frame is a new women 
writers' group on campus, which had its start-up meeting two 
weeks ago. The Communicator featured a story on the new major; 
the writers' group has signs all over campus. 

Perhaps then, you've heard, or you've spoken these lines: "Why 
isn't there a mens writers' group?" "Why isn't there a men's studies 
major? We'd catch hell if we suggested such a thing." 

These lines, at least as old as feminism itself, are cried out by 
men to question the need for women's progress- The women's lib- 
eration movement has been pushing and working for over 30 years 
now, no? Aren't there women in the Capitol, in the boardroom, in 
the galleries, in the bookstacks? The war is over, and women 
have taken their place, right? Why push anymore? 

The answer is obvious, but most men turn a blind eye to it. 
American women are underrepresented, underpaid, and poorly 
recognized in proportion to their numbers and inlluence. To 
improve their lot, they must work collectively and individually. 
Despite 80s' setbacks, they continue to do so. 

For the American male, though, the range of action has nar- 
i rowed, it only in his personal life. The 80s saw the sensitive male - 
i known popularly as the "Alan Alda type" - mocked and satirized in 
the media. A new round ot pumped-up hypermales were offered 
as new American heroes - Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Eastwood. 
CEOs became famous. Nuclear family bliss ruled on prime time 
TV. The American man was marched straight back to the gray- 
flannel 50s. 

It is the 90s now, and dissatisfaction is showing. Women are talk- 
ing to each other, working and moving. They seem vital compared 
to their male counterparts still slotted into the same work-and-pro- 
vide roie created for men in the Industrial Revolution. The voices 
keep sounding telling men what's wrong with them: "Even 
today.. .half the young males are what I'd call soft," said author 
Robert Bly. Sam Keedy equates male self-definition with detach- 
ing men from women's concerns. Self-proclaimed feminism 
Camille Paglia wonders where the cocky male from days of yore 
has disappeared to. while Deborah Laake complains, 'They can be 
sensitive and they often possess the wry humor characteristic of 
the observer, but they don't want to carry the ball." 

The American mate feels swallowed up. Women are displaying 
the vitality man thought was his birthright. He watches it all from 
his spot in front of the TV, the numbing reward he gives himself 
after an eight-hour day. Women are the enemy to be refused and 
resisted. 

It's wrong. American women are just starting to take the places 
denied them for three centuries. Room has to be made for them in 
the male psyche as full equals in every facet of life. 

Men have to make room for themselves, too. The new men's 
movement of the 90s would have them turn inward to find the "wild 
man" inside, and return to tribal councils to communicate. Interest- 
ing idea, but John Doe has to return from his wild-man weekend to 
the same pressures that he felt walled in by in the first place. No, 
the answer lies outward. Each man has to seek out something 
that individualizes him. 

His interest can be creative. He can write, paint, sculpt, build. A 
man can explore. Jump from planes, scale a rock lace, get on a 
motorcycle and ride. If manhood doesn't lie in putting up a TV 
antenna and mowing the lawn, ifs up to you to decide what will 
take you there. Don't measure yourself by what women are 
accomplishing. Make your own measure. 

Therein lies masculinity, and humanity.

Controversy 



Student calls for deeper look at Snyder 



To the Editor: 

I'm nol a politically active student, 
much less an influential one, but I do 
(eel a need to speak out, lot once, and 
say thai enough is enoughll This Mark 
Snyder vs. The Entire Universe Ihing 
has become ludicrously annoying. 
Can't we just leave the man alone and 
get on with our lives? 

Like Sarah A. Faurote, I don't know 
Mr. Snyder. I wouldn't even know what 
he looked like il I hadn'l seen him 
strumming his guitar in PIT'S produc- 
lion ol "The Cherry Orchard" (and he 
was good loo!). I don't judge total 
strangers, as so many are fond of 
doing. Besides, as William Saroyan 
wrote, "Every man is a good man in a 



bad world ■ as he himself knows." 
Don't YOU Know? 

Everyone loves controversy, and this 
is the core ol the "problem." By contin- 
ually disparaging Mr. Snyder and all 
{ALL) that he stands for. we're reinlorc- 
ing this never-ending debate which, I 
admit, is oddly amusing, but slupidly 
senseless and unproductive. 

I know you guys don't care about 
these silent words because they've 
been written by a faceless unknown 
who has little, if any authority, but I 
implore the student body to end this 
childish charade! There are more 
important and relevant issues to deal 
with on this campus. Have we some- 



how become obsessed with (his person 
that every single week, The Communi- 
cator MUST, compulsively, comment 
upon his siiuationl Mark musl be a 



"Mark must be a pretty 
majestic person to have 
achieved such total con- 
trol over the Letters to 
the Editor section. " 



pretty majeslic person lo have 
achieved such total control over the 
Letters To The Editor section (as this 



letter examplilles quite well). 

Can't you see the wondedul irony ol 
this whole affair: The more you push 
him away, the more dominant he 
becomes. It's funny, actually. It seems 
as if there's a conscious attempt to 
drag this issue out forever. Bui maybe 
I'm wrong. Alter all, who am I? Bui 
more importantly, who is Mark S. Sny- 
der? Does anyone even know any- 
more? Alter the multitude ol perhaps 
all inaccurate and caricatured portray- 
als ot Mark, I don't see how anyone 
can get to the real person that he is. 
How many ol us bother to look beneath 
the surface to find "Ihe good man?" 

Tessa V. Gochtovtt 
IPFW Student 



IPFW needs to watch 
out for 'kooks' 



To the Editor: 

Is this Mark Snyder guy the only 
student who writes letters to the 
newspaper? Is every student's life 
so busy that they can't take 15 min- 
utes out of their days to write down 
what they think? Aren't any of these 
students interested in voicing their 
opinions? 

Everyone is so apathetic. I'm 
beginning to think that no one around 
here has an opinion. The only peo- 
ple who seem to pay attention to 
what's going on around here are the 
kooks I 

These same kooks get voted in as 
student body presidents because the 
majority of students would rather be 
shuttled around like cattle by the 
administration. Oh sure, an occa- 
sional gripe pops up but then some 
fruitcake decides he's going to be the 
champion of this complaint and he 



scares everyone away. 

Students at this University had bet- 
ter start showing some interest in 
.what's going on around here or a 
bunch of nuts are going to be in 
charge of the student senate. Not all

Comments on Chad 



To the Editor: 

In the past years while attending 
IPFW. I have heard various com- 
ments regarding The Communica- 
tor. Most of these commenls tend 
to be negative, including "nol worth 
picking up," or "There's a school 
paper?" or "I've never read The 
Communicator." 

But from the encouragement of a 
W131 professor. I generaled sev- 
eral letters to the editor and also 



responded to ihe Acid Wash con- 
test Fall '90. I was thrilled to partic- 
ipate in the contents ol The Com- 
municator and lo win ihe Acid 
Wash Contest (even Ihough I sus- 
pect that I was only one of two who 
entered). However, as one who 
cared enough to participale, I am 
still waiting on my promised Acid 
Wash T-Shirl. It is no wonder stu- 
dents tail to respond or participate

Mold Man, DeNiro and Mindy all make 'Angle' 



By Jim Walker 

Managing Editor 

MOVING ON UP - Recenlly, I 

moved out ol my dark, dank base- 
ment apartment where I wallowed 
alone In mold spore-initiated 
depression for nearly two years. 

Now I live above ground level in a 
building with actual windows. Now I 
live in a nice place on a lovely nat- 
ural lake. And I have a new room- 
male, my sister. 

She Is helping me deal wilh my 
aversion lo washing dishes and 
cleaning up messes around the 
house. There used lo be a hand- 
painted sign hanging over my 
kllchen stove that read "Jim's 
kilchen: Food, Folks and 
Fungus." In (he new place, my 
sister has hung this sign over the 
stove instead: "God bless this 
kilchen." 

So, needless to say, there have 
been a lew changes around my 
everyday existence. But belore I 
escaped to the surgical cleanliness 
ol my new home, I had to break 
from the ghosts ol my slob pasl. So 
here's a little true nightmare Irom a 
couple weeks ago when I moved.

Obtruse Angle 

by Jim Walker 



Then I armed myself with a hock- 
ey slick and pried Ihe cupboard 
door open. Slowly it creaked open 
to a liny black crack. "Eeek!" I cried 
as a foamy, hairy, green creature 
burst Irom behind the door. It was a 
mold genie escaping from a pasta 
pot. It was Mold Man! 

Being the hero which I am, I 
stealthily grabbed a nearby can of 
Lysol room deodorant, sprayed it at 
Mold Man and lit a match. I torched 
the sucker. I'd swear I heard Mold 
Man mutter fhese haunting words, 
"Aaarrgghh, Aaarrgghh, Euhhhh!" 

Mold Man went on to add that 
even in killing him I could not 
escape his wrath-he'd already 
emitted millions and millions of 
spores that would follow me the 
rest of my days. 

Oh, well. 

UNSOLVED MYSTERIES 

UPDATE - Last week in this col- 
umn, Ihe mysterious love triangle 



of our pholo editor Mark Daley 
unfolded. Remember, he was 
being dauntlessly pursued by a 
secret admirer. 

Well, with the help of a call from 
one of our viewers, the crazed, 
obsessed secrel admirer dude has 
been apprehended and is currently 
in the custody ot the IPFW police 
department Bui who was this 
female Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driv- 
er? 

Its Mlndy the Dance Squad Girl, 
(See picture). You've seen her 
hanging around, you've walked on 
her as she lie taped to the side- 
walk. And now she's Mark's little 
muscular, well-defined kitten. 

SEX ON CAMPUS - After last 
week's Angle bit about ihe absence 
of sex on campus, our slafl has 
received a vertiable blizzard ot 
feedback concerning real places lo 
do the wild thang here at IPFW. 
We'd like lo thank student Goon for 
his input on this matter. 

So here is a list of good and then 
not-so-good places lo have sex on 
campus. By ihe way, we don't con- 
done sex on campus, or in any oth- 
er place for lhat matter. 

Good Places 

1. Those little study rooms in the 
library. 

2 Greek suite couches. 

3. New parking garage elevator. 

4. Gazebo in Aquarius Park (com- 



ing soon). 

5. Behind Ihe pine trees, down by 
the river, in ihe sunshine. 

6. In your van. 

7. On a Fort pool table. 

8. On a carefully selected Nau- 
lilus machine. 

9. In ihe Holiday Inn (even Ihough 
it's not on campus, it's still a greal 
place). 

And the bad places: 

1. Gravel parking lot. 

2. In Ihe Fort grill area. 

3. TV lounge In Walb. 

4. On a parking garage ramp. 

5. On a cement bench. 

6. Third floor of Classroom Medi- 
cal Building with dead guys, 

7. Hmmmmm ... 

We found it a lot more difficult lo 
come up wilh bad places than we 
thought. 

And please, please, unless you 
and your partner resemble Mickey 
Rourke and Kim Basinger, don'l 
have sex where we could stumble 
across you. 

DID YOU EVER NOTICE? • This 
is supposed to be a regular spot in 
ihe new 90s Angle. Bui I didn't 
nolice anylhing this week.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern 



Stoppard play has characters with a history; PIT play opens Oct. 4 



By Marcl Copsey 
Stall Writer 
Talk about a couple o( losers. Rosen- 
crantz and Guildenstern have been 
dying regularly ever since 1600, when 
Shakespeare llrsl did away wilh the 
iwo In "Hamlel." Then In 1967 the grim 
reaper, In the guise ol Tom Stoppard, 
gave the Iwo errand boys a play ol their 
own In which to croak; 'Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern Are Dead.' Well, 
some people never learn, 



This is the whole point ot the PIT pro- 
duction of Stoppard's play, opening Fri- 
day, Ocl. 4. and continuing weekends 
until Saturday. Oct. 19, Lorraine 
Sauier, visiting assistant professor ot 
theater, is director. 

Sauter said it's important to remem- 
ber that this play is, above all, a come- 
dy. Too often the work is analyzed into 
something more than the playwright 
Intended -"a lot of solemn and scholar- 
ly stuff." to quole Stoppard-when it is 



just plain funny. 

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are 
two minor characters in "Hamlel" who 
are sent to England wilh a message (or 
the king: Hamlet is to be killed at once. 
However. Denmark's prince dupes the 
duo and changes the message to read 
thai the bearers of the letter are to be 
killed. And the rest is history, which 
repeals itself, of course. 

In Stoppard's comedy, Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern are never sure what 



Gunners rock on dual Illusion 



By Chad Hestlng 

Feature Editor 

Guns n' Roses 

Use Your Illusion Ml 

Gellen Records 

I did It loo, I confess. I waited with all 
those loen-agers at midnight two Mon- 
days ago, a twenty-dollar bill clutched 
in my hot little hand. What lor? To say I 
was one of the first 500,000 dudes 
privileged enough to own "Use Your 
Illusion l+ll," the new Guns n' Roses 
record, the very hour it was in the 
stores. Only in America could a dude 
be so lucky. 

The line was long, but the wait was 
short, because no one wanted to 
browse. The good clerk slid my tape 
across the counter, and I broke lor the 
parking lot. I raced another Gn'fl fan 
down Clinton 10 get home. Busied 
through the from door, jacked "illusion 
l" into the tape deck, turned it up to 
eleven. Would it be worth it? Well... 

...Yes. Both records are long on G n' 
R cock and snot. This time, though, 
new ideas abound. "Use Your Illusion 
l+ll" expands the hard rock vocabulary 
considerably. 

The band has added two new mem- 
bers since their last record. Dizzy Reed 
plays piano, while Matt Sorum sits at 
the drums now. Sorum told an inter- 
viewer recently that joining Guns n 
Roses fell like "being in Led Zeppeli 
He matches that sentiment on "Illusion' 
by showing that he shares the same 



two advantages that made John Bon- 
ham a great drummer: Sorum hits 
hard, and he hits prescise. It's Reed, 
however, that adds a new dimension to 
Guns n' Roses. His bluesy piano 
accents light up the rockers on "Illu- 
sion," while providing the soil hooks at 
the center ol the slower songs, such as 
"November Rain." 

The four charter members divided up 
the songwriting chores, unlike the 
songs on 1988's "Appetite for Destruc- 
tion." Thai record was an Axl-and- 
Slash show, but this time Izzy Slradlin 
lakes several song-writing credits, as 
well as a couple of lead vocals. Bassist 
Dull McKagan wrote and sang one 
tune, as well. The resulting variety ol 
sounds on 'Illusion* are a credit to the 
band's democratic approach. (Some 
cynical souls may attribute the music's 
variety to detox, though,) 

But you want to know what rocks. 
"Right Next Door to Hell," "Dust n' 
Bones," "Back Ofl Bitch,* "Double 
Talkin' Jive," "Get in the Ring," " You 
Could be Mine," "Dead Horse," "Bad 
Obsession." and "Shotgun Blues' are 
the real burners. Each of these tracks 
brim with genuine bile. Wealth hasn't 
mellowed the boys much. Rose goes 
overboard on "Get in the Ring." in 
which he calls out several rock journal- 



ists and offers to punch the fronts out 
of their mouths. I'm pretty certain that 
nobody cares about Rose's hassles 
wilh the press, other than Rose. And 
the press. 

Just before the end of 'Illusion II* is 
the wildest card In the pack. "My 
World" features distorted guitar notes 
Irom Slash while an out-ol -control drum 
machine slaps away. Rose jabbers 
over this hellish noise about what you'd 
(eel like in his shoes, lighting and curs- 
ing and running and stressing all the 
time. The music snaps off after only a 
minute of this, leaving the listener 
weirded out and wondering, is this 
where Guns n' Roses will take me to 
next time? 

Could be, because they've got 
enough talent and juice for the long 
haul. 

Caveat emplor: Guns n' Roses and 
Gelfen Records know a big pay-day 
when Ihey see one. "Illusion I" and 'Illu- 
sion II* are sold seperately at single- 
record prices. If you want both, be pre- 
pared to pay nineteen dollars, rather 
than the tradiliaonal, unified double 
record price of tifleen dollars. Rotten ol 
them to juice teenage dollars like that 
during a recession, but like Rose sings 
"If you want your soul to bleed, boy, 
that's the price you pay.* 



roles they're playing or whal's going 
on. But everyone else seems to know, 
including the Player, one ol the tragedi- 
ans in "The Mousetrap,* the sub-play in 
"Hamlet." 

Sauter told of three worlds in the play: 
lhat ol Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, 
Hamlet, and the Player. "Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern are Stuck in place; 
they know they're playing a game but 
don't know what it is.* 

The director explained that the "Ham- 
let* characters can come and go within 
Rosencrantz and Guildanstern's world 
but are unaware of outside events. 
Their advantage is that they're supply- 
ing information to the two main charac- 
ters. And. according to Sauter, the 
Player "knows which way the wind is 
blowing,*

Diaz plays Guildenstern, and Joe La 
Fargo is the Player, Steury, an IPFW 
theater major, has appeared in numer- 
ous PIT productions, including "Master 
Harold ... and the Boys,* "In the Boom 
Boom Room" and "Speed Ihe Plow." 
Oiaz.a1991 IPFW graduate, has acted 
in "Tremor Cordis,* "Tis a Priy She's a 
Whore* and "West Side Story.* La 
Farge, though not a student, should 
also be familiar to PIT audiences. 

Sauter said she chose to do this play 
because ol its language (it's full ot play 
on words and innuendo) and the chal- 
lenge it represents But she said it's 
also a lot ol tun because it's about 
game playing. 

The 1967 production was no game 
but took New York by slorm and gar- 
nered Tom Stoppard numerous 
awards, including the New York Drama 
Critics Circle Award for best play. The 



comedy Is easily Stoppard's most 
famous work and has been performed 
regularly in England and Ihe United 
States, Including a 20th-anniversary 
revival by the Roundabout Theater 
Company in New York. 

The original version was set in Eng- 
land with characters that Included Cym- 
beline and King Lear. However, this 
version didn't fly and Ihe playwright 
changed nearly everything, except lor 
"Ros* and *Guil." 

Those who are unlamlliar with Shake- 
speare's work needn't hesitate to see 
Ihe PIT production. Sauter has updated 
Ihe setting to 1920s and '30s America 
(or a late Vaudevillian. slapstick flavor 
which should be familiar to Fort Wayne 
audiences. 

However, Rosencrantz and Guilden- 
stern are definitely going to die. Again.

Waiting for Addie 

Pregnant Heather disrupts household during long stay 



By Chad Hosting 
Features Edilor 

Utile Orphan Heather came to our 
house lo stay. Unlike Riley, she didn't 
come lo cook and clean and chase the 
gobl'uns away. She wanted to wait out 
the last month of her pregnancy at our 
house. Her husband, Steve, worked 
70 hours a week lo make a sort finan- 
cial bed for his child to fall into. My 
roommate Deirdre. my wile and I 
thought that would be just swell — we'd 
be witnesses lo the Miracle ol Birth, 
nght there in our house. 

Her husband, Sieve dropped her off 
ai our Ironl door on a humid Sunday 
afternoon. Heather beelined lor the 
couch. As she did, her pants slid of 
their own accord off her waist and pasi 
her knees. When they reached her 
ankles, she simply stepped oul of 
Ihem, Whump! On the couch she 
flopped. Heather sighed, then told her 
captive audience: 

"God, it's hot. Could someone aim 
the fan towards me?' 

That was July 1. Healher didn't 
leave the couch, or put her pants on 
until the birth date, Sepl.13. 

Shop was set up immediately. It had 
been a tong-running joke among us 
that Heather made a mess anywhere 
she went, anywhere she sat. This time 
wasn't any different, except now she 
had ihe pleasure of watching the mess 
being brought to her. 

"Bring me a glass of ice water so I 
can watch Ihe baby roll." Yes, Heather. 

"I've got New Women, Glamouf, Elle, 
Shape, Redbook; but no Cosmol I 
need Ihe new Cosmol I gotta be up-lo- 
dale on breasl implant newsl* Yes, 
Heather. 

"Where's my hasenpleller?" Very 
funny. Heather. 

The mess was her own private Sev- 
en-Eleven. Prenatal vitamins, true- 
crime paperbacks, empty glasses, 
WIC vouchers. Diet Pepsi cans, John- 
son baby oil. cats— all wilhin arm's 
reach. II there was something out ol 
stock, though. ... 

One day she burst in on Deirdre in 
the kilchen. "No catalogs!" she yelled. 

"Huh?" Deirdre was shocked just lo 
see Healher upright. 

"The mail carrier was here and she 
didn't bring ANY CATALOGS!" (My 
wile and I were on one thousand mail- 
ing; 'lists. Membership has its privi- 
leges.) 

'What am I suppose to read?" 
"How about the neighborhood asso- 
ciation newsletter? There's an expose 
in it on people who don't mow their 
lawns." 

Heather spat in Deirdre's soup and 
stomped back lo Ihe couch. 

Heather attended her weekly doctor 



appointments faithfully. Early on, they 
were lighthearted affairs, lull of hopeful 
banter and uftrasound photos. As Ihe 
pregnancy went one, two, three weeks 
overdue, the trip lo Ihe O.B. took on 
greater urgency. My wife and I wailed 
for the pearls of wisdom that fell Irom 
the good doctor's lips, but every weak it 
was. 'Make another appointment lor 
Healher next week, please." 

The trips lo Ihe toilet came more and 
more frequently. Every lifleen minules, 
all nighl, in the bathroom next lo our 
bedroom. When Heather flushed, my 
eyes snapped open in perfect sync with 
my wile's, across the bed. The flow 
never stopped. 

What's important to remember, dear 
reader, is thai we really didn't mind the 
demands on our lime and patience. 
Not at all, because Heather's body had 
turned on her, jusl because of a baby 
In her belly. Her abdomen muscles 
cramped constantly. Headaches were 
commonplace. She gained 60 pounds, 
and her waist was a big stretch mark. 
Bolh breasts had grown, bul one was 
now two cup sizes larger than the oth- 
er. 

And her ankles, they were so swollen! 
The elephant man would have pitied 
her. One day I saw her bang an ankle 
against the coffee table's leg. Healher 
groaned, bul I shrieked, and fell to my 
knees. "Healher! My God, the painl" 

She gave me a Dirty Harry squint. 
"Shut upl" she commanded. "Quit your 
whining. You're such a wimp." True, 
all true. I could do pushups until 
doomsday and my body couldn't bear 
the strain hers was. I had a serious 



womb envy. 'You're right," I said. 
'Wail here. I'll go letch you the new 
Cosmo." 

Cosmo aside. I had a secret weapon 
lo ease Heaiher's discomfort. After my 
second-shift job was done, I'd make a 
midnight Kroger's stop and pick up two 
pints of Ben and Jerry's Super New 
York Mondo Massive Death by Fudge 
Chunk Ice Cream. I knew cramping 
would keep Healher awake and lhat 
the treat would be much appreciated. 
I'd lake my pants off (to be democratic) 
and we would feast. Heather traded 
ihe white chocolate pieces in her 
BAJSNYMMDBFCIC for Ihe chocolate- 
covered almonds in mine. The nightly 
ritual gave us Ihe sugar blues, but it 
was a fun way logo. 

Then one day it happened. Heather's 
pregnancy was no more. I goi the call 
Irom my wile while I was at work — after 
thirty-eight false labors. Heather and 
the doctor decided to induce. My 
appointed task was lo pick up her hus- 
band, Sieve, at his northside factory 
job. 

Her husband, Sieve, didn't say a 
word during the trip to Lutheran. His 
eyes flitted around, he wrung his 
hands. When the hospital came into 
sight, he said, 'Couldn't we stop at a 
liquor slore first?" A dry laugh came 
from his throat, but there was no joy in 
it. 

We got out of Ihe car. "It's not loo 
laie," her husband, Steve, said, "I could 
still make a run lor it, andsin Canada by 
nightfall." Another laugh. Just Ihen, a 
laxi rushed by.

Uh-oh. 

Her husband, Steve, boiled in the 
taxi's direction. "Slop! PleaseP he 
hollered, until I tackled him. Noire 
Dame-style I had him, bul he kept 
straining, his fingernails scraping Ihe 
cemenl. 

■Aaaghl Slop! My lost youth.* he 
screamed. 

Adulthood had ils claws in his back 
and had rode him down like a panther 
Won'l blame him for being frightened, 
but I had my quarry to deliver. With Ihe 
help of a security guard (who had six 
kids of his own), I stuffed and locked 
him in Heaiher's room. 

Then I went home and wailed lor 
word. Thirty hours later my wife came 
in limping lo Ihe door. "Eight pounds 
lour ounces, mother daughter line," she 
mumbled. 

"God, it was horriblel* She started 
weeping into her hands Irom pain and 
fatigue. "They gave her that damn 
Pilocin to induce labor. II caused her 
so much pain, she went completely 
sideways. Heather asked for an ice 
chip lo suck on. and when I gave it to 
her, she spat il into my eyel" She 



wepl. "She said rt was too bkjf" 

I rubbed her back, but I felt for 
Healher. Proportion is very important 
lo a woman birthing a nine-pound 
baby. 

As it happened, Ihe hormones 
Heather gave oft in our house during 
her pregnancy threw all our lives into 
disarray, Deirdre was thrown off her 
menstrual cycle, rendering The Pill 
useless. She was pregnant by Thanks- 
giving. My wife left me the week after 
Ihe birlh date. Even Ihe cats want into 
heal. 

Heather is untouched by it all, though. 
Addie is a big, bright, beautiful child 
with an ear-piercing squeal. Her hus- 
band, Steve, even mellowed out. Two 
days after Ihe birlh. he pinned me 
against ihe wall in the hospital cafeteria 
and totd me, "Addie Is Ihe lighl ol my 
life. If you tell anyone about. ..." No 
sweat, I promised. The three of them 
go through Ills wilhoul any memory ol 
six months of cramps and swollen 
ankles. Heather can smile sweetly 
now, and say. "What pain?" 
That is Ihe real Miracle of Birth.

of I placed first with 20 points followed 
by Si. Joe, with 51. IPFW placed third 
in the race with 84 points. 

Coach Dave Neoiy was pleased with 
the women's performance. 

They ran a real smart cross country 
race," he said. "They ran as a learn 
instead of simply for time.* 

U of I's Michelle Faulkner won the 
race with a time of 18 minutes and 46 
seconds. Nancy Bushnell led the IPFW 
women finishers, placing 111h with a 
lime of 21:24.
