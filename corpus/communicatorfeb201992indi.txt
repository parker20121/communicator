NEWS BRIEFS 



IPFW ARTWORK FEATURED; 
EXHIBIT ON CAMPUS 

Two exhibits in the IPFW Fine Arts Building will be 
celebrated with a free, public reception on Sunday, Feb. 
23 from 2 to 5 p.m. 

The new exhibits feature the paintings of Norman 
Bradley, an associate professor of fine arts at IPFW, and 
a collection of ceramics and computer art called "From 
Greenware to Software 2." 

The Bradley exhibit will be on display from Feb. 10 to 
March 8. The collection can be seen in the first and sec- 
ond floor corridors in the Fine Arts Building. 

According to a release from the Fine Arts Department, 
Bradley's world travels, particularly in Latin America, 
provide inspiration for his works in acrylic, watercolor, 
and oil which are reflected in titles such as "Amazonia," 
"Sonara," "Romeria," "Caribe," and "Azteca." While 
those acrylic paintings are colorful, Bradley's watercol- 
ors such as "Event" or "Inscription" offer more muted 
colors. 

Students used computers as tools to create art in "From 
Greenware to Software 2." Others made raku, earthen- 
ware, stoneware, and pit-fired ceramics. Some of the 
pieces are composed of tiles intended for display on 
walls and others are free-standing, "self-portrait" vessels, 
according to the release. 

For the second consecutive year, the exhibit was orga- 
nized by Nancy McCroskey, an assistant professor who 
teaches ceramics, and AnnMarie LeBlanc, an assistant 
professor who teaches computer graphics. 



AUDITIONS FOR PIT PLAY 
TO BE HELD SOON 

Auditions for the upcoming PIT theater production, "A 
Steetcar Named Desire." will be conducted Sunday, Feb. 
23 at 2 p.m. 

The auditions will take place in the theater located on 
the ground floor of Keltler Hall's east wing. 

"Streetcar" will open April 17 at PIT with perfor- 
mances on April 18, 23, 24, and 25, April 30 and May 1 
and 2. 

Larry Life, the plays director and an associate professor 
of theater at IPFW, is seeking about 25 people of ages 
ranging from early 20s to 50s. Life noted that there are 
many other roles in "Streetcar" besides the leads of 
Blanche, Stanley and Stella. 

"I want to capture the ambience of New Orleans," Life 
said. There is much going on in the streets. So much 
symbolism that (Tennessee) Williams wrote is beautiful, 
and is so often lost in productions of the play." 

Life said those auditioning for Blanche must read with 
a southern accent. He noted that she is the only character 
in the production who will speak with the accent. All 
women auditioning should wear a skirt and blouse or a 
dress and high-heeled shoes. Life said. 

This spring, New York's Broadway will launch a 
revival of "Streetcar" with screen stars Jessica Lange as 
Blanche, Alec Baldwin as Stanley and Amy Madigan as 
Blanche's sister, Stella. The Broadway production is set 
to open in New York at about the same time as PIT's 
production, according to Life. v 

Scripts may be checked out on a strict. 24-hour loan 
basis from the theater department in Kettler G30. 



SHORT STORY WRITER 
TO READ HERE 

Ann Harleman, an award-winning short-story writer 
from Rhode Island, will be on campus Thursday, Feb. 27 
to read some of her work. 

The event will take place in Walb Memorial Union, 
Room 224 from noon to 1:30 p.m. There will be no 
charge to hear Harleman. 

According to Wendell Mayo, assistant professor of 
English at IPFW, Harleman won the Judith Siegel Pear- 
son Award for fiction in 1991 and was a finalist in the 
Flannery O'Connor and Nelson Algren Literary competi- 
tions. Harleman also won the Raymond Carver Short 
Story Prize in 1986. 

"We arc very lucky that it worked out so well to have 
her read here," Mayo said. "She is a fine writer and she's 
won some prestigious literary prizes. For that reason we 
are fortunate to have her here to give us a reading." 

Mayo also noted Harleman is a skilled non-fiction and 
essay writer. Her articles have appeared in "The Journal 
of Short Story" and "English," "Semiotica," and many 
others. 

Harleman has been an instructor at Brown University, 
MTT, and Dartmouth College. 



IPFW to share ideas with Polish university 



By Mary Shrock 

StatT Writer 

What do Copernicus and IPFW 

have in common? 

If you said the second old- 
est university in Poland, 
you're right. 

IPFW is currently negotiating 
with Jagiellonian University, in 
Cracow, Poland, to start a 
research project where East real- 
ly does meet West. 

Established in 1364 in Cracow, 
Poland, Jagillonian University is 
a highly respected university 
which claims Copernicus as one 
of its most famous graduates, 
according to IPFW sociology 
professor, Bronislaw Misztal. 

Through a grant currently in 



the works, administrators and 
professors from IPFW would 
work with their equivalents at 
Jagiellonian University, Misz- 
tal said. 

"It's a mutually beneficial net- 
work and a valuable opportunity 
to sec other perspectives," noted 
Misztal, who is from Poland. 

IPFW can utilize the partner 
university as an outlet to do 
things we can't get locally and 
then similarly Jagiellonian can 
do die same with IPFW, Misz- 
tal said. 

The Polish want to know about 
Fort Wayne's local government. 
American history and our demo- 
cratic institutions; and Ameri- 
cans want to know how the Pol- 



implement democracy, 
according to Misztal, who hopes 
to make all of this information 
available to other scholars. 

Evangclos Coufoudakis. vice 
chancellor of academic affairs, 
is another university official 
who takes a great interest in 
introducing IPFW to Polish 
culture. Coufoudakis is 
presently involved with the 
chancellor of Jagiellonian Uni- 
versity in an ethnic-minority 
project. The two scholars are 
researching the Greek presence 
in Poland and its effects. 

According to James Owen, 
public and environmental affairs 
coordinator. IPFW has achieved 
a firm base as a community uni-

Senate announces increase 
in student service fee 



By Chad Hesting 
Managing Editor 

An increase in the student ser- 
vice fee was announced at the 
Feb. 14 student senate meeting. 

According to student govern- 
ment advisor, Marian Adair, 
the board of trustees approved 
the hike at their last meeting. 
The fee is to be raised from 
$2.35 per credit hour to $2.50 
per credit hour. 

Previously a limit of $25 per 
semester, per student bad been in 
force. That ceiling will now be 
raised to $30 per semester. 

In other student affairs, the 
senate filled one committee 
chairmanship with two co- 
chairs, while another committee 
chair was purposely left empty. 

The senate unanimously 
approved Victoria Vinson and 
Katie Groatrian as co-chairs of 
die internal affairs committee. 

After bearing reports from sev- 
eral student affairs committee 
members, John Weisenberger, 
vice president of legislation. 
commented that the student 
affairs committee seemed to be 
"doing very well" without a 
committee bead, and suggested 
that die committee go on without 
one until after die next student 
government election to be held 



this spring, 

"There's some great work com- 
ing out of student affairs lately, 
and I don't think we really need 
a recommendation on a chair 
yet," Weisenberger said. 

Several student affairs com- 
mittee members voiced their 
approval and no negative 
comments were made on the 
measure. 

Student affairs committee 
members reported progress on

work coming out of 
student affairs. "

the student discount package. A 
report on formaldehyde fumes in 
Classroom Medical Building is 
expected from Senator Felix 
M oxter next week. 

The senate had a lengthy dis- 
cussion on adding an amend- 
ment to the appropriation for 
copies of Robert's Rules of 
Order to be distributed to student 
senators. No consensus could be 
reached among the senators on 
whether the copies should 
remain die property of 1PSGA, 
or whether a fee should be 
charged for damage to the 
books, so the purchase resolution 



was tabled until next week. 

Senator Robert Murray initi- 
ated a discussion on campus 
grade-appeals procedures. 
Murray characterized the pre- 
sent process as "academic free- 
dom for the faculty, and not for 
the students." 

Indiana Univcrsity-BIooming- 
ton's faculty evaluation survey 
was brought up and problems 
with bringing a version to IPFW 
were discussed. 

Senator Greg MUIer noted that 
IPFW evaluations aren't stan- 
dardized and that standardizing 
I.U. and P.U. evaluadons would 
be difficult. 

Miller suggested a far simpler 
version of die evaluation, sug- 
gesting one which asks whether 
the student approved of bis or 
her ui-i.rui.ior and die reasons 
why. Senator Felix Moxter sug- 
gested the student affairs com- 
mittee might be interested in 
looking into the costs of the 
effort involved. 

Senate attendance remained 
low at the Feb. 14 meeting. 
Until a senator arrived pan- way 
into the meeting, a vodng quo- 
rum of senators was not present. 

The next public meeting is on 
Feb. 20 in Walb Memorial 
Union. Room 1 14. 



Grant money brings writers 



By Rachuel Gibson 
Staff Writer 

Through the efforts of Wendell 
Mayo, assistant English profes- 
sor, IPFW has obtained a grant 
which is now being used to pro- 
mote creative writing, literature 
and poetry on campus. 

The grant of $420 was obtained 
by Mayo through the Indiana 
Arts Commission and the 
National Endowment of die Arts. 
With the additional support die 
IPFW Arts Group, Mayo has 
instituted a number of programs 
to take place on campus in the 
coming months. 

"The university regularly spon- 
sors visiting scholars who give 
lectures, ct cetera, and 1 think the 
importance of (hat sort of 
exchange of ideas and informa- 
tion is recognized in academia," 
remarked Mayo. "We don't wani 
to isolate ourselves from other 



universities and ideas." 

Mayo went on to say, "I think 
we should have different writers 
of poetry, short stories, novels, 
or creative non-fiction come in 
so we know what kind of writing 
is being done In contemporary 
literature in this country." 

With the extra funding the 
grant provides, four programs 
are scheduled that serve as 
excellent opportunities for any 
student interested in literature, 
according to Mayo. 

The first event features Ann 
Harleman, recent winner of die 
Judith Siegel Pearson Award for 
Fiction. She will be giving a fic- 
Uon reading on Thursday, Feb. 
27, from noon to 1:30 p.m. in 
Walb Memorial Union. Room 
224. 

Then, in March, authors Jack 
Matthews and John Bradley will 



offer readings from their works. 
Matthews is a diverse author 
who has published novels, story 
collections, books of poetry, 
essays and plays, according to 
Mayo. Matthews can be heard 
on March 25 from noon to 1:30 
p.m. in Neff Had, Room 101. 

On March 26, at noon to 1:30 
p.m. John Bradley will be read- 
ing excerpts from his books of 
poetry. The event will take place 
in Classroom Medical Building, 
Room 159. 

Matthews and Bradley will 
also offer fiction and poetry 
workshops while they are at 
IPFW. To have a chance to take 
part, students must submit 
manuscripts to Mayo in the 
English department by March 1. 

Mayo noted that all of the com- 
ing events are open to the public 
at no charge. 



versity but hasn't had the oppor- 
tunity for a universal 
exchange — until now. 

Psychology, chemistry, sociol- 
ogy, biology and political sci- 
ence are just some of the depart- 
ments that IPFW hopes to get in 
the exchange program. 

But what about the students? 
What is their part in a potential, 
long-term exchange program? Is 
this foreseeable to have a student 
exchange program with Poland? 

Owen wants students to get 
involved, while this seems like a 
good idea, he docs see several 
problems with sending an Amer- 
ican to Poland. 

The first problem, Owen said, 
is the language barrier, then get- 



ting the appropriate credit hours 
transferred and finally, a lack of 
bousing. Most European col- 
leges, according to Owen, don't 
provide student housing. 

But on the bright side, accord- 
ing to Professor Misztal, "It's an 
invaluable opportunity to see 
other people." 

IPFW chancellor. Joanne 
Lanlz. has already seen Ameri- 
can teachers sent to Fort 
Wayne's Polish sister city. Ploct, 
as an attempt to share a basic 
knowledge of die English lan- 
guage with the Polish people. 
Lantz said she considers the pro- 
posed exchange with Jagielloni- 
an an informal way to help peo- 
ple work together. 



Experts explore effects 
of recent rape trial 



By Mike Wade 
News Editor 

In a recent trial in Indianapolis, 
heavy-weight boxing champion. 
Mike Tyson, was convicted of rape. 

Linda Johnson, coordinator for 
the Center for Women and Return- 
ing Adults, said that she thought 
Tyson's conviction would influ- 
ence the chances that future rape 
victims would come forward. 

"It took a lot of courage on her 
part to come forward, and 1 think 
ih.ii it will encourage others to 
come forward," she said. 

Johnson explained that people 
will see not only that Tyson 
raped a woman, but that he is 
going to jail for it. 

Judith Dilorio, director of wom- 
en's studies, said that she was not 
sure Tyson's conviction would 
affect future rape victims' deci- 
sions on whether to come forward. 

However, DUorio said that she 
(bought (he conviction may 
affect future rape trials. 

"It is the first highly publicized 
trial that ended in a conviction 
for what is considered date 
rape." sbe said. 

"It may affect the likelihood of 
certain situations being prosecut- 
ed," she concluded. 

Johnson said that she did not 
expect Tyson's conviction to have 
much impact on future trials. 

Dilorio said that, in addition to 
possibly affecting what cases are 
prosecuted, the Tyson trial could 
affect how they are prosecuted. 

"The very creative defense thai 
Tyson's attorneys offered failed, 
therefore I do not expect to see 
that approach again," she said. 

Johnson explained that 
although rape victims would see 
that Tyson is going to jail, they 
would also see that two-thirds of 
the rapists do not. ' 

Johnson said that most victims 
arc not widing to put themselves 
through die legal process only to 
see their attacker freed. 

Commenting the emotional 
reactions to the trial, Johnson 
said, "I have heard many women 
say that they were really 
incensed when they heard that 
he laughed when he ripped off 
her clothes. 



"For me it was that, after 
everything, he didn't even have 
tbe decency to give her a ride 
home. He stole her dignity from 
her at every possible step." said 
Johnson. 

More facts about 
rape issue 

The subject of rape and related 
crimes have been afforded a 
great deal of publicity in recent 
months, possibly increasing the 
public's awareness of the issue. 

In general, rape is forcing or 
coercing another to have sexual 
intercourse, and in Indiana there 
must be actual penetration, said 
Linda Johnson, coordinator for 
the center for Women and 
Reluming Adults. 

Johnson added that the laws for 
date rape and marital rape are 
often different from die general 
law on rape. 

Mary Koss of Kent State Uni- 
versity issued a report on her sur- 
vey of 7,000 students from 32 
college campuses. 

One of every eight men admit- 
ted to forcing or attempting to 
force a woman to have inter- 
course, said Koss' report. 

However, the report also stated 
that the same men would not 
direcdy admit to having commit- 
ted rape or attempted rape. 

43 percent of the women who 
said that they had been forced to 
have sexual intercourse did not 
label the incident as rape, said 
the report. 

"Experts estimate that 90 per- 
cent of all rapes go unreported," 
said Johnson. 

Johnson continued to say that 
by die year 2000, one in every 
three women would be the victim 
of sexual assault. 

The incidence of sexual assault 
is increasing and women need to 
be aware of the danger of rape, 
said Johnson. 

"It is important that people 
realize that they must take 
responsibility for their safety," 
she said. 

If you go to a party, you should 
go with a friend and have your 
own transportation, advises 
Johnson. 

"In order for date rape to occur, 
the rapist must separate you from 
the group. He must get you 
alone. The car is often an oppor- 
tunity for him to get you alone. 

"If you have your own trans- 
portation, the chances that you 
will be raped will decrease," said 
Johnson. 



Voter registration 
available here 



By Jim WaUter 
Editor in Chief 

Now there's an easy way for 
people at IPFW to register to 
vote. 

According to Michael 
Downs, chair of the political 
science department, Allen 
County residents can register 
to vote in his Classroom Medi- 
cal Building office, in Room 
209. until March 18. 

After March 18 and until 
April 6, Allen County residents 
can register in the Keystone 
Building at 606 South Calhoun 
St. in Fort Wayne. 

County residents already reg- 
istered to vote and those regis- 
tering during tbe next few 



weeks will be eligible to vote 
in the presidential primary on 
May 5. 

Downs said his office hopes 
to allow more people a chance 
to register. "It Is easier for 
most people on campus to reg- 
ister here than go downtown." 
he said. "The more people who 
register, the more people who 
vote." 

Downs said voter registration 
has taken place in bis office for 
the past five years. He noted in 
the past between 20 and 30 
people per year have registered 
to vote through bis office. 

"Quite a few people have 
already come in this year," 
Downs said.

Media bypasses the 
real terror of rape 



The national media has a few lessons to teach 
us about the crime of rape. 

1. Victims are "loose" women who provoke 
rapists. 

2. A woman who goes to a man's house on the 
firsi date implies her inierest in having sex, and 
if she refuses, she invites rape. 

3. Women charge rape to cover accidental 
pregnancies, or to lake revenge. 

4. Victims are young, careless women who 
invite rape. 

5. Oiherwisc decent men arc spurred to rape by 
the clothing or behavior of women. 

These myths are rooted in innuendoes and pre- 
suppositions, but the media has primed us to 
believe them. 

Since 1980. five incidents of rape, or alleged 
rape, have been held up for our inspection by the 
national print and television media. They are: 
the recently concluded William Kennedy Smith 
and Mike Tyson rape trials; Cathleen Crowell 
Webb's recant of her 1985 accusation of rape by 
Gary Dotson; Tawana Drawley's story of rape at 
the hands of white tormentors; and the rape of a 
woman in a bar, with witnesses present, in New 
Bedford, Mass. (later dramatized in the film 
"The Accused"). 

These cases are relevant for what they showed 
the public the mechanics of rape trials. Howev- 
er, ihey detracted from the crime of rape itself, a 
far more serious issue. 

The Tyson and Smith cases became victim tri- 
als under the media spotlight. The lifestyle of 
-Smith's alleged victim came to be as important as 
her testimony; in the eyes of the media. 

Leaked details about her divorce, children, 
unpaid parking tickets, and social habits 
appeared in the media before the first wimess 
was ever called. Even her bra was thrown across 
supermarket tabloids. 

The details offered on Tyson's victim before 
the trial were a far easier pill for the public to 
swallow. She was 18 years old young and naive, 
with no marks so diny as unpaid parking tickets 
against her name. The results of the two trials 
bear out the prejudice of the evidence that leaked 
into the press. 

The Webb and Brawlcy cases became "was she 
or wasn't she" questions for reporters and the 



public to puzzle over. Ultimately, the two wom- 
en's motivations for their "false" accusations 
became the central issue. 

They were anecdotes and litde else. 

The New Bedford case was noted for two rea- 
sons. The first being the validity of the witness- 
es' trial, the second being whether the victim's 
behavior jeopardized her case. 

By pulling these stories on the tube, and the 
from page.t he press clouded a simple fact. Rape 
is a serious and frequent crime, with enough 
myths surrounding it to hide the source of the 
true risk. 

One of the ways the public reacts to a shocking 
news item is by social distancing. If the reader 
can differentiate between him/herself and the 
offender or the victim, the easier it becomes to 
avoid real fear. 

So lhe media supplied the cues on the subject 
of rape by choosing these stories. Smith's 
alleged victim might have been a "particr"; thus 
more likely to be sexually active; thus more like- 
ly to be lying through her teeth. Mike Tyson, 
huge, black, brusque, and a "habitual buttocks 
fondler" in the eyes of the Black Expo pageant 
organizer, is a likely victimizer in the American 
imagination. 

The facts are that one rape occurs in the United 
States every six minutes. Rapes account for six 
percent of violent crimes in the United States. 
"Non-stranger" rapes, FBI reports state, account 
for 55 to 60 percent of all reported rapes, with 
date rapes accounting for a significant portion of 
these. 

Rapes occur at all hours, to women of all ages, 
and a large percentage of rapes occur in the vic- 
tim's home. 

Yet the media won't deal with rape as a com- 
monplace crime. In a survey of eight big-city 
daily newspapers, murder stories comprised half 
the violent crime stories, though murder was the 
least frequently occurring crime. 

Murder stories appeared as much as 16 limes 
the number of rape stories. 

Were more information given on local rape sto- 
ries and statistics, a clearer picture could be 
drawn for women. They could then decide for 
themselves; play safe, or learn to fight. 



Students for Life 
president speaks out 



To the Editor: 

Mr. Hesting, I can only feel sorry for someone 
who has been as misinformed as you. Especially 
someone who is a reporter for the paper. You 
should have verified your facts before printing 
them in the paper, 

Merc are the facts. The March For Life took 
place on Saturday, Jan. 25 to commemorate the 
19lb anniversary of Roe vs. Wade. It (the 
march) is intended to educate the public on lhe 
sanctity of all life. If by marching we lie up traf- 
fic, I apologize. 

You were right to say thai some marching are 
part of Northeast Indiana Rescue but others are 
not. The March for Lire Committee and North- 
east Indiana Rescue are two separate groups yet 
the goal ihey have is common- respect for all 
life. 

The fact is that, yes, people do block clinic 
doors. But ihey also write letters to congress, 
they make phone calls, Ihey work during elec- 
tions and Ihey give money. But above all, Ihey 
pray. They pray for the Supreme Court, lhe 
police force, sidewalk counselors, and the moth- 
ers and fathers who arc bringing their babies into 
the clinic lobe killed. 

I am an on-sile sidewalk counselor and I have 
never called anyone names. Wbai I do say is 
"Lei me lake you (o hear your baby's heartbeat 
Your baby needs you. Please don't kill him. 
There are places I can take you where they will 
give you everything you need to give your baby 
life. I will pray for you and the soul of your 
baby." 

Do these sound like statements coming from 
someone who is inhuman or cruel. No, Mr. Hes- 
ting, Ihey are not. They arc statements coming 
from someone who cares about women and their 
babies. I know that they arc making one of the 
hardest decisions of their lives and I want them 
to have all lhe options presented lo ihcm so they 
can make a wise choice. 

Mr. Hesling, you also attacked the Roman 
Catholic Church with malice and no good rea- 



son, The Roman Catholic Church has cared for 
the homeless, children, lhe poor, and the sick 
since its beginning, like Sl Vincent de Paul soci- 
ety and Sl Mary's Soup Kitchen. There is also 
Catholic Social Services, food and clothing 
drives, io mention more. Catholic grade schools 
and high schools give freely to the Christmas 
Bureau and Toys for Tots, Shall I go on, Mr. 
Hesting. By being raised Roman Catholic, I 
know about caring for the least of my brothers. 

I cannot speak for the Protestant Church 
because I am not Protestant but I am glad that 
they chose to serve God in any way they see fit. 

You were right in saying that America has 
become sexually oriented. The truth is that sex 
sells. It sells you diseases, AIDS, and unplanned 
pregnancies. It sells you emotional problems 
and physical ailmenis. Those are the facts. 

If it seems io you that pro-lifers are trying to 
reverse (he sexual revolution by declaring con- 
ception the beginning of life, I'm sorry we are 
only stating a biological fact not a religious or 
ethical one. 

The fact is that each week 20 babies are mur- 
dered at the Fort Wayne Women's Health Orga- 
nization in the name of choice. 

The fact is that over a million children will not 
graduate ibis year because they have been killed 
in the name of choice in the past 19 years. 

The fact is thai our civilized society chooses 
to pick on its weakest members: the prebom, the 
elderly and the handicapped. 

The fact is that I am pro-Life and not ashamed 
to be. The fact is thai I will probably block clin- 
ic doors in order to save babies' lives. I am dedi- 
cated to the respect of all life from conception 
until natural death, 

I pray each night for people like you, Mr. Hes- 
ting, who are blind to the with. I pray for our 
campus and our country. I pray lhai God will 
have mercy on our land.

Coach Ball thanks fans 



To the Editor: 

Thanks for supporting 
IPFW Volleyball. 

I, and the members of the 
IPFW men's volleyball 
team, wish to thank all the 
fans that attended the Fort 
Wayne National Bank/Pep- 
si Invitational, Jan. 31 and 
Feb.l. It is with your 
enthusiastic support that 
we were able to defeat 
Penn State on Friday and 
USC on Saturday. 

For the past 10 years 1 
have coached at IPFW, and 
it has always been a dream 
of mine to have the Athlet- 
ic Center filled io capacity 



with screaming students, 
faculty, staff, friends, and 
fans, and to have my team 
play at a very high level of 
competition with success. 

A special thanks goes to 
all the media for their sup- 
port and interest. There are 
many things in our com- 
munity for us lo appreciate 
and cheer. I thank all of 
you for choosing the Vol- 
leydons as one of those 
things. Thank you and I 
look forward lo seeing you 
al many more IPFW athlet- 
ic events.

Writer urges action 



To the Editor: 

The voluminous responses 
to Chad nesting's commen- 
tary on the recent pro-life 
march present little that is 
new to the abortion debate, 
but they send one message 
loudly and clearly: Many 
opponents of abortion rights 
are eager to state their views 
publicly, whether in print or 
in the form of a march or oth- 
er demonstration. 



I was appalled lo see not one 
single letter in support of 
Chad's piece of the pro-choice 
position. As a long-time sup- 
porter of abortion rights and 
one who can remember all too 
well what it was like prior lo 
Roe v. Wade, I thank Chad 
for speaking up on this issue, 
and I urge others who share 
these views to do the same.

Snyder's words prove point 



To the Editor: 

On the Feb. 13 Opinion page, 
of The Communicator, Mark 
Snyder, in his letter to the editor, 
used the following quote from 
Slanislav Andreski: "Verbiage 
increases to the extent that ambi- 
tion exceeds knowledge." Using 



his chosen quote as a basis for 
evaluation, Mr. Snyder must be 
the least knowledgeable but 
most ambitious person on the 
IPFW campus.

God's teachings prevent sex problems 



To the Editor: 

Although written sarcastically, 
the first paragraph of Chad Hest- 
ing's editorial was quite accurate. 
It said, in part, that "life begins 
at day one after conception, and 
thai stopping the embryo's 
progress at any point after that is 
murder." 

Abortion is murder. Many 
people don't understand why 
mere is such a fuss over what 
ihey consider a "blob of tissue." 
The following facts dispel the 
notion that an unborn child is a 
"blob." Only three weeks after a 
baby is conceived, its heart 
begins beating. At six weeks 
after conception, brain waves are 
measurable. Eight weeks fol- 
lowing conception, all of the 
baby's systems and organs are 
functioning. The baby also 
sucks his/her ihumb, swims, 
grasps, and responds to touch. 
At twenly weeks, the baby has 



hair, eyelashes, fingerprints, and 
can even survive outside the 
womb. ("The First Nine 
Months," "Focus on the Family") 
These facts speak for them- 
selves. The so-called "blobs of 
tissues" killed in abortion facili- 
ties are living human beings. 

The choice to have sex obvi- 
ously comes before the decision 
io have an abortion. But con- 
Irary to what Mr. Hesting seems 
lo think, sex is not a necessity of 
life like food and water. The 
decision to have sex before and 
outside of marriage is contrary to 
God's teachings. If we follow 
the laws God lovingly gave us, 
we will be protected from 
unwanted pregnancy, abortion, 
and sexually transmitted diseases 
(STDs). including AIDS. 

However, the phrase extolled 
by the media to solve these ills 
of society is not "Just Say NO," 
but rather "safe sex." "Safe sex" 



is a myth, but you will never 
hear the failure rates of contra- 
ceptives on TV. The following 
statistics are the failure rates for 
pregnancy, those for STDs are 
much higher. A condom has 
more than 18 percent failure 
rate, the Pill a 10 percent failure 
rate, the diaphragm a 32 percent 
failure raie, the IUD a 10 percent 
failure rate, and spermicides a 
33 percent failure rate. ("Grand 
Illusion: The Legacy of Planned 
Parenthood", George Grant, 
page 30) Of the aforementioned 
contraceptives, the condom is 
the only one that offers any pro- 
tection against STDs. So, what 
many unabashedly term "safe 
sex" is not safe almost one in 
five times. This means that 
there is no "safe sex" except 
between a mutually faithful mar- 
ried couple. 

Isn't it a coincidence that God 
has been telling us (his same 
thing all along? Mark 10:6 says, 



"From lhe very fust, God made 
man and woman to be joined 
together permanently in mar- 
riage. . ." And in I Corinthians 
6:13.18. it says. "The body is not 
meant for sexual immorality, but 
for the Lord. Flee from sexual 
immorality. All other sins a man 
commits are outside bis body, 
but he who sins sexually sins 
against bis own body. Do you 
not know that your body is a 
temple of the Holy Spirit, who is 
in you? You arc not your own, 
you were bought with a price. 
Therefore, honor God with your 
body." 

With the power of the Holy 
Spirit, people can guard againsi 
sexual immorality and refuse lo 
have sex before or outside of 
marriage. By doing tin-, they 
will also avoid unwanted preg- 
nancies.

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Local abortion clinic 
unsafe, says student 



To (he Editor: 

I am writing in response to Chad 
Hastings unfounded editorial wbicb 
appeared in The Communicator two 
weeks ago. Although several sludents 
have already done a great job exposing 
his false representation of pro-lifers. 
there are still a few things I would like 
to respond to. 

llesting states that "Those entering 
an abortion clinic ... arc subjected lo 
'loving' abuse from the pickcters." He 
also accuses pro-lifers of yelling at the 
women entering the clinic and calling 
them terrible names. I bavc been 
involved in peaceful demonstrations in 
front of the abortion clinic in town for 
many years, and I have never seen any 
pro-lifers verbally or physically abuse 
the women entering the clinic. The 
only one who is abusing these women 
is the abortionist who kills their chil- 
dren. 

The man who performs abortions in 
Fort Wayne, Ulhrich Klopfer, is not an 
M.D. or a licensed gynecologist. He is 
not a member of the AMA and does 
not have hospital privileges in Indiana. 
He is also being sued by several wom- 
en for malpractice. The complaints of 
these women include: uterus perfora- 
tion, severe hemorrhaging, negligence, 
severe and permanent disfigurement, 
failure to complete the abortion, and 
improper surgical instruments. 
(Sources: St. Joseph County Court- 
house, South Bend, Ind. and Cook 
County Clerk, Richard J. Daley Cen- 
ter. Chicago, HI.) 

The media and pro-abortionists try 
to cover up the fact that, like Klopfer, 
many abortionists in our nation are 
being sued for malpractice. They tell 
the public abortion is a simple and safe 
medical procedure; however, many 
women who have had abortions suffer 
terrible physical and emotional pain 
following the death of their child. 

Some of the physical effects of 
abortion on the mother include: 1. 
heavy bleeding—some women need 
blood transfusions following their 
abortion. 2. pelvic inflammatory dis- 



ease-an infection which leads to fever 
and infertility. 3. damage to the 
cervix--can lead to miscarriages and 
premature births in later pregnancies. 
4. perforation of the uterus— when the 
doctor is scraping the wall of a wom- 
an's uterus for the remains of her baby. 
be could cut a hole in her uterus or cut 
right through her uterus and perma- 
nently damage some of her internal 
organs. 5. sterility, 6. death. 

There are also psychological effects 
of abortion. Most women experience 
severe guilt and depression. Some 
patients have long-term psychiatric 
problems. A woman's relationship 
with the father of her baby also suf- 
fers. Only two out of 11 women will 
continue in their relationship with the 
father, and a third of all married cou- 
ples experience separations during the 
pregnancy/abortion period (sources: 
Grant, George. "The Legacey of 
Planned Parenthood, Chapter 2; and 
"Facts You Should Know About Abor- 
tion," pamphlet). 

In almost every stale, abortion clin- 
ics arc not required by law to explain 
to their clients the dangers of abortion. 
Why don't they have to mention any of 
these risks? The answer: abortion is a 
huge money making industry. In 
1988. Planned Parenthood, the opera- 
tor of the largest chain of abortion 
facilities in the United Slates, received 
S23.7 million from performing over 
100,000 abortions (Factshect: PP The 
Nation's Leading Provider and Pro- 
moter of Abortion). If clinics 
informed women of all the risks sur- 
rounding abortion, many women prob- 
ably would decide not to go through 
with their abortions, and the clinics 
would lose a lot of money. 

The pro-lifers who faithfully go 
down to the clinic every Thursday are 
not "abusing" the mothers entering the 
abortion clinic, but encouraging them 
to choose life. A choice that will save 
them and their unborn children from 
an abortionist's knife.

Snyder says senator 
relies on 'supposition' 



To the Editort 

Two weeks ago in this newspaper 
there appeared to be a concerted effort 
by some to resurrect Students' Govern- 
ment (IPSGA) as a viable entity. We 
were served up the whimperings of 
Tad Atkinson, an IPSGA senator and 
President Frazicr- Henry's latest pur- 
chase. 

Mr. Atkinson, sneaking from his vast 
experience in Students' Government 
(he has been a member for less than 
thirty days), a writes first person 
accounts of this writer's actions while 
a member of IPSGA. Obviously Mr. 
Atkinson is relying on hearsay, rumor, 
and supposition as I ceased all partici- 
pation in IPSGA in November-well 
over two months before Mr. Atkinson 
was yel in November-well over two 
months before Mr. Atkinson was yel a 
twinkle in President Frazier- Henry's 
eye. He then proceeds to write of his 
lengthy friendships with members of 
Students' Government. The only indi- 
vidual in Students' Government Mr. 
Atkinson has known for more than a 
few months is former Senator Sally 
Green. It was Senator Green who, 
based on knowing Mr. Atkinson for 
several years, effectively blocked his 
confirmation as a senator on his two 



previous attempts to join IPSGA. Ms. 
Green staled that Tad was "...a puppy, 
loyal to whoever will pel him," and 
"...he never bad as original thought in 
his life." Additionally, I think the 
readers of this newspaper should be 
aware of the credentials of Mr. Atkin- 
son. As a former graduate leaching 
assistant and therefore a paid member 
of the faculty at this university, Mr. 
Atkinson is a pan of ihe system he so 
verbosely defends in his letter. Finally 
I would like to ask Mr. Atkinson what, 
exactly, is a "vast microcosm?" Is this 
a large little? Buy a dictionary, Mr 
Atkinson, and look up ihe meaning o 
oxymoron. Meanwhile I will rest easi 
er knowing that Mr. Atkinson has re 
directed his "talents" from teaching 
composition in our English Depart 
ment lo thai of politician be seemingly 
has the necessary talent of obfuscation. 
In conclusion I would like to thank 
Mr. Atkinson for providing us with the 
proper metaphor of IPSGA summed 
up in his plea to the student body and 
The Communicator regarding this 
writer "ignore bim utterly and com- 
pletely." That's right IPSGA shut-up 
those who would disagree with you.

Do the Mastodon Mambo 



To the Editor: 

I am not writing this letter to attack 
you, your grammar, or Chad's opinion 
on abortion. That business is better 
left lo the James Mounts of this world. 
Instead I would like to take this oppor- 
tunity to set the record straight regard- 
ing the "Goon Moon". 

The act ! was committing when that 
picture was snapped was not the vul- 
gar or childish act that you assumed it 
was. Actually, what I was doing is 
called the "Mastodon Mambo". It 
seems that die mastodon would often 
wave and bounce his or her bodacious 
backside at animals 'don wished to 
welcome to bis den. Unfortunately, 
ihe Panthers of Kentucky Westeyan 
failed to recognize this pre-bistoric 
greeting. During the second half of 
the men's game, I traveled to the K Y 
Welly cheering section to further 
extend our welcome to ihese worthy 
competitors. Before I could do so I 
was expelled from the building. 

Please ask the student body lo help 
me show the athletic department that 
we sludents arc proud of our traditions 
here at IPFW, no matter how old they 



may be. The next home game is next 
Thursday, February 27th, at 6 pm and 
8 pm against Indianapolis. So bounce 
your butt and torque your lushy and 
let's welcome Indy to our home court. 
GO DONS!

Nasty boys 

Harrassment results in some drastic measures 



By Chad lies ting 
Managing Editor 

A lot of women have dealt wiih scrnial 
harassment in the workplace, But when 
your have a whole building full of 
Clarence Thomas wanna-bes ogling your 
every move, you begin to feci like 
Madonna without her Blond Ambition. 

My co-worker, Gwcn, is the one I'm 
talking about. Gwcn is blessed, and 
cursed, with striking beauty. 

Gwcn's best described as Ihc brunette 
Julia Roberts, tips like pillows, legs like 
swords. She favors smart blazers and 
double-breasted jackets that compliment 
her hips. 

All the men at work liked her. They 
liked her a lot. They wanted to like her 
all night long. 

I picked up on it the day she started 
work. When I walked in the door, a 
small crowd of security guards was clus- 
tered around the entrance to her de-par L- 



"Papcr-clip ihefl sung, guys," I asked. 

"Naw," one said. "Look. Ain't she 
bodacious?" 

Through the glass doors they watched 
Gwcn stoop low lo pick up a fallen pen- 
cil. 

"Damn. 1 ' breathed a guard. "Ass like 
that'll put Cagncy's out of business." 

Well ... that guard was a pig, but truth 
was that Gwcn lit up every man in the 
place. When she stepped in the room, 
ties got straightened, flics were checked, 
and smiles were flicked on high beam. 

Even Chuckles lightened up. Chuck- 
les was a sucken-cyed desk jockey from 
upstairs who had a personality like Poc 
on 'ludes. Since he discovered Gwcn 
was a smoker, though, he bounded down 
the stairs for his hourly Camel with a 
grin. 

For the next 15 minutes they smoked 
together. He, waving his smoke around 
and talking computer jargon; she, pinned 
against the wall with dazed look on her 
face, with no polite route out of the con- 



Hcr sex appeal still showed through the 
ruffles. She became more popular than 




As days went by, Gwen's clothes took a 
turn for the worse. She ditched her blaz- 
ers for a "Little House on the Prairie" 
schoolmarm look. The tops of her frilly 
collars now tickled her carlobes; and her 
hemline sank lo mouse-eye level. No 



Chad Hesting 

Walking down the hall one day, I heard 
a "Pssst" coming from my left. No one 
around-, must have been that damn Taco 
Bell across Ihc street. 

Then I heard a louder "Pssst" from a 
broom closet. I opened it lo Had Gwcn 
hunched down inside. 

"There's a man around the comer trying 
lo get mc to go to lunch with him," she 
said. "Please get rid of him; now, 
please." 

I turned the corner to sec a musta- 
chioed man waiting there. 

"Sir," 1 yelled, "have you heard? 
Quayle announced he's running in '96." 

He screamed and ran down the hall. 

Gwcn came out and clapped mc on Ihc 
back. 

"Thanks so much." she said. "You're 
not one of them." 

"Them?" 

"Let me show you." She led me to her 
cubicle, (hen switched on her voice- mail 
machine. 

"If you have a message for Gwcn, press 
1 on your touch-tone phone. If you have 
a proposition for Gwen, press 2. If you 
have a marriage proposal for Gwen, 
press 3." 

As I laughed at the message, Gwcn 
pressed another button. 

"Gwcn, you have three propositions 
this rooming." 



I quit laughing. 

They're around mc all the time," she 
said "I can't get rid of them. If they're 
not asking me out lo a movie and dinner, 
they're making small talk of making 
those dirty little jokes and innuendoes 
men make when they're turned on." 

She grabbed mc by the lapel and said, 
"Why do men do that?" 

Gwcn was clearly close to the edge. 

"I don't know," I stammered, "Genetic 
defect I guess." 

"Probably." she concluded. Gwen 
grabbed an interdepartmental mail enve- 
lope from her desk and tapped me on the 
chest with it. "All I know is that it had 
belter slop or something drastic is gonna 
happen," she said. 

I turned and walked away, but I hadn't 
gone ten steps when Gwcn let out a 
shriek. When I got back to her she was 
weeping. 

"Look at this." She shoved the mail 
envelope into my face. I pulled out what 
appeared lo be a photocopy of a very 
realistic set of male genitalia. In fact, it 
appeared that someone had sat his naked 
behind on a workplace photocopier and 
sent the replica of his manliness to 

In Magic Marker at the bottom was 
inscribed. "Impressed? call Mike at 423- 
— ." Like any other workplace, ours 
had over 100 Mikes working there, so 
pinpointing which one, as the culprit, 
would be impossible. 

Anyway, Gwcn left work early, jabber- 
ing about Anita Hill and mandatory cas- 
tration laws. I didn't really expect her 
back, so I was surprised to see 
ing up the walk to the staff cntra 
with a woman beside her.

Her usual crowd of admirers straight- 
ened their tics and checked their flies. 
"Maybe that's her sister," somebody 
snickered. 

Gwcn and the woman stopped a few 
yards in front of the men. Gwcn looked 
at her companion, sighed and said, 
"Goodbye, honey." 

"Goodbye, honey," said the compan- 

Thcn they kissed for a very long lime; 
20 jaws dropped in unison. Some of the 
men began weeping. Chuckles face 
snapped back to its original hangdog 

She broke her embrace and breezed b&gt; 
her deflated admirers. 

"Hi guys," she sang. Nobody followed 
her in; nobody except mc. I waited until 
she settled into her seat, then whispered, 
"OK, Gwcn, who was that?" 

She leaned over the me. "My cousin, 
Claire," she said, "She agreed to so it for 
a case of Corona and a copy of that new 
"Vox" novel. There kind arc all homo- 
phobes. I knew it would work." 

Gwcn punched the button on her voice- 
mail machine. "You have no new propo- 
sitions," it intoned. 

"Cheap at twice the price." she said.

Crusade for Christ enhances romance, love 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Features Editor 

Enhance your romance? Give high- 
powered love? Check a box and tell us if 
you've asked God lo come In to your life 
so we can pray for you if you didn't? 

These are pretty risky topics for the 
Campus Crusade For Christ, but this Is 
what they came up with for their latest 
ami-sin campaign. 

Review 

Last Monday, Dob Boyd spoke on 
improving love and relationships by 

Using God. The speaker has travelled 
around Ihe country lecturing lo college 
students, and has also written a book on 
ihe subject. 

Boyd's lecture, which about 20 people 
attended, seemed to be more interesting 
to him than to his audience. Although he 
received lilllc response from the audi- 
ence, Boyd did offer an array of interest- 
ing topics. 

The speaker began by saying that high- 
powered love, which is God's love for 
lis, is greater than human love, 

"God's love Is unfailing. This is the 



key to all romantic relationships. If we 
know God's love for us, then God will 
provide for our needs, and he will pro- 
vide us with friends and family. These 
are the things thai we lake for granted ihe 
most," Boyd said. 

Back in his "wild, college days." Boyd 
said he was fairly reckless. This, he said, 
was before he had "let God into my life." 
He said thai he was speeding along a 
highway at 80 miles per hour and fell 
asleep at the wheel. Boyd's car swerved 
off the road and into a diich, he scarcely 
escaped deaih. 

"If everything hadn't happened exactly 
the way it did. if one thing was different, 
I would not have survived," Boyd said. 

After this potentially fatal accident, 
Boyd said that he "tapped into God. 
which can allow us to give love to others. 
God gives us to love so we can demon- 
strate it." 

Boyd listed three ways lo demonstrate 
God's love. 

The first way lo demonstrate love. 
Boyd said, is "our words to others 
because they can build or destroy a rela- 
tionship." He added that it is important 



lo remember statements like "I love you, 
I'm sorry, and I forgive you." These 
three statements, he said, are ihe most 
important things people can do to keep 
the lines of communication open, 

A second way lo demonstrate God's 
love is by actions. Boyd said, "Il's not 
always just talking, it's listening, too." 

The third way Boyd recommended to 
demonstrate God's love is by touching. 
"There's something special about jusi 
being touched and caressed in a loving 
way," Boyd explained. 

One thing to always remember, accord- 
ing to Boyd, is that God's love is uncon- 
ditional. He said that everyone wants to 
be loved just the way they are. Boyd 
said that things like anger, the inability to 
forgive, ihe lack of love of others, and 
independence from God separate us from 
his unconditional love. 

"We must believe lhat Christ died for 
our sins and rose again for us. We must 
confess him as our Lord and ask him to 
come into our lives." Boyd said. 

The only thing anyone has to do, 
according to Boyd, is jusi ask God 
"lo come inio your heart and he will 



be there." 

As proof that God will "come into your 
heart," Boyd ended his sermon by asking 
the few audience members lo bow their 
heads and just ask. 

A member of the Campus Crusade For 
Christ entourage passed out a comment 
card. The card asked for the names, 
addresses, and phones numbers of all 
audience members, and had three boxes 
to check. 

The firsl box to check requested more 
information on Boyd's lecture. The sec- 
ond box requested more information on 
how one can grow in ihe Christian faith. 

And the third box? Well, this box was 
to be checked only if "you bowed your 
head and asked lo receive Chrisi in your 
life tonight because if you didn't we want 
lo know so we can pray for you," Boyd 
announced. 

"We're not going to post the names of 
the most religious persons on campus, 
bui we just want to know," Boyd said. 

The Campus Crusade For Chrisi meets 
on Mondays in Kcltler, 1 17 from noon to 
1 p.m. "Come to the meeting and revolu- 
tionize your life," Boyd added.

This is just one of the many outra- 
geous things Wayne Campbell and
