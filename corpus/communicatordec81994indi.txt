Bill to send 
ACM 
members 
on trip 
vetoed 



By S. Branl Kelley 
News Mllor 

The IPSGA sifuck down a 
bill advocaljng sCudcnt funding 
of a trip to Nashville. Tennessee 
by ihc Association of 
Compuling Machinery (ACM) 
afier a lengthy debaic during 
Monday's IPSGA meeting, 

Bill 199'l/95-o was a propos- 
al written by IPSGA senate 
member Tan V. Bui requesting 
S500 to assist in defraying costs 
of the trip which was to be taken 
by four members of the IPFW 
chapter of ACM, The bill was 
voted on and received 12 "yes" 
votes, zero "no's", and four 
abstentions on Nov. 21, 1994. 

IPSGA President Mark King 
vetoed the bill and IPSGA's 
affirmative nod on Nov. 23. 
King said he wouldn't fund a 
trip by an organization which 
contributed no funds of its own. 
Tan Bui was absent from the 
IPSGA meeting and unable to 
comment at Ihc time. 

Cecil Baker, IPSGA senate 
member, s^d ACM wasn't ask- 
ing that all expenses be 
defrayed. 

George Gounaris said that 
the S500 originally accounted 
for travel, lodging, food and 
personal expenses. Later, ACM 
relumed with a revised request 
wanting S500 for travel and 
lodging, but not food or person- 
al expenses. He said the num- 
bers given by ACM were jug- 
gled, but not reduced. 

Gounaris said be couldn't see 
IPSGA funding the entire trip. 
"The government is there to 
provide an assist.. .not to give a 
full ride," he said.

IPFW evaluating drop-out rate 



By S. Brani Kelky 

News Editor 

Acting Vicc-Chanccllor of 
Academic Affairs Fred Kircbboff 
and Vice-Chancellor of Financial 
Affairs Frank Borelli spoke about 
student retention cfTorts at the fac- 
ulty-sponsored open forum on 
Thursday, Dec. I. 

The retention team, which 
includes Director of Admissions 



Karl Zimmerman, Comptroller Phil 
Grote, Dean of the School of Arts 
and Sciences David Cox, and 
Director of Career Services Marian 
Zimmerman, sent 1100 surveys to 
various classrooms for students to 
nil out. 

The 1100 students included 500 
freshmen, and 200 each of sopho- 
mores, juniors, and seniors. Marian 
Zimmerman said freshmen were 
polled more heavily because they 



have a higher drop-out rate. 

IPFW sent the survey's results to 
a company by the name of Noel- 
Levitz along with other information 
about IPFW. Noel-Levitz will send 
an evaluation team to IPFW on Jan. 
17 and 18 to study the campus and 
suggest changes to keep students 
here. Borelli said the evaluation 
will cost about $9,500. 

Chancellor Michael Warlell said 
that the system was not perfect, but

interior affairs, in accordance with 
ExccuUve Order 1994-95/8, effec- 
tive Monday. She said she has not

of IPSGA and it would be a new 
experience 

Eads was formerly co-chaii of 
Ihc Internal Affairs Committee of 
IPSGA. He is a sophomore major- 
ing in history. He will conduct busi- 
ness on behalf of IPSGA with 
Indiana and Purdue Universities,

Canned pop nets top vending profits 



By No) T. Becklcy 
StalT Writer 

IPFW receives 25 percent of 
gross sales from each can of soda 
sold on campus, except in Walb 
Union, according to the contract 
between the university and the 
vending supplier. Canteen Corp. 

Don Hagcr of Canteen Corp. 
said. "IPFW has the highest com- 
mission of all accounts we have." 

Hagar added. "Most colleges 
have the highest vending rates of 
their community." 

Hagar also said that Purdue in 
Lafayette makes all the decisions 
concerning the vending contracts. 



The contiacts are signed every 
five years. IPFW's contract with 
Canteen Corp. expires June 30, 
1996. 

Among the businesses supplied 
by Canteen Corp. are North 
American Van Lines, NIPSCO. 
ITT, and Waierfield Mortgage 
Company. 

Waterfictd Mortgage Co. 
charges 10 cents less for soda cans 
than IPFW. but their other vending 
products are close to the prices 
charged on campus, according to 
Hager. 

Nancy Renell of Waterfield 
Mortgage said. "We make it a ser- 
vice for the employee." 



ITT's prices are comprable to 
IPFW's. except concerning soda 
can prices. 

One vending company, which 
wishes to remain unldentiHed, said, 
"Can pop fuels your profitability 
and the board must decide whether 
it is in the best interests of the busi- 
ness to create more fuiances or keep 
prices down for the customer." 

Profits from vending machines 
in Walb Union stay witiiin Walb 
Union and support funds related to 
operating tbe building, according to 
director of purchasing, David 
Lceka, 

Profits from Uie rest of campus 
are applied to the general operating 



it was the best system available He 
said be expccLs the evaluation to be 
finished by early March. 

Wartcll said a phone-a-thon was 
conducted to determine major rea- 
sons for students dropping out of 
school. The phone-a,-thon results 
gave no reason or reasons which 
stood out from the rest. The phone 
survey did not ask students if they 
plan to transfer to another college 
or university. 



Registrar Jack Dafal said the net 
transfer into IPFW is greater than 
the net transfer out of IPFW, 

The study will be used to deter- 
mine what will encourage students 
to stay in school. Kirchhoff said 
student retention efforts will not 
mean that academic standards will 
be reduced. 



Lady 'Dons hang 
tough; win tourney 



chair, replacing John Young, Young 
resigned his poiii because of gradua- 
uon. Gounans was confirmed with 
1 1 affirmative votes. Steenman also 
appointed Shawn Stanley as chair 
of legislative affairs, replacing 
Chris Douse. His appoinunent was 
approved with 1 1 affuTmaiive votes. 
Hogan's appointment as director 
of interior affairs leaves the chief 
justice's seat open, in addition to 
two other scats on IPSGA judicial

tion of director of exterior affairs 
leaves an additional senate seat

The Lady 'Dons defeated the 
University of Missouri-Rolla 
(UMR) at the Diet Pepsi/Lady 
Rogers Invitational tournament 
championship last Saturday 
evening at Ihc Gates Center. 

The UMR defeated Gannon 
University in the fust semifmal on 
Friday evening. IPFW defeated 
Norlhwood College 92-82 in the 
other semifinal to gel to the cham- 
pionship game. 

The Lady 'Dons used 19 Miner 
turnovers and withstood 9 Miner 
three -pointers to pull out the win, 
82-76. for their second-straight 
Diet Pepsi/Lady Rogers 
Invitational championship. IPFW 
coach Pam Bowden attributed the 
'Dons win in part to UMR's zone 
defense. She said she was surprised 
the Miners stayed in it as IPFW 
succeeded offensively against it. 

UMR overcame a five-rebound 
disadvantage and 43 percent field- 
goal shooting to beat Gannon 
University 55-40 in a low-tempo 
game. Gannon shot only 34 percent 
fnam the field. 

Stephanie Gonzales led the 
Golden KnighLs with 16 points, and 
Julie Szykowny added 12. but four 
other Gannon players only scored 
12 more. Becki Reichard led UMR 
with 11 points, and seven other 
Miners combined for 44 points in 
the win. 

IPFW shot 64.8 percent from the 
field to overcome seven three- 
pointers by the Northwood women 
in an otherwise sloppy game which 
saw each team give the ball away 
28 times. Bowden said Northwood 
showed a bigger improvement over 
their four-win season last year than 
people expected. 

Tara Muzzillo had a game-high 
22 points, Jennie Newhard 21. and 
Lindy Jones 19 in the win. 
Newhard added 12 rebounds. 



fund, student fees and state appro- 
priations, claimed Leeka. 

Larry Yarnell of Anthony 
Wayne Vending Co., in referrcncc 
to IPFW's prices, said, "[They're] 
actually kind of high." 

Anthony Wayne Vending has 
very few customers that can charge 
the same price for soda. 

"One contract that we have that 
can charge 65 cents per can is with 
the highway commission at their 
rest stops." said YameH. 

Ninety-five percent of AnUiony 
Wayne Vending Co. clieois charge 
50 cents per can and receive 10 per- 
cent commission, according to 
Yaruell. 



Bowden was pleased with 
Muzzillo's performance and said 
she finally was doing what she 
needed to do. Kristin McCormick 
scored 20 and Sarah Brandt added 
14 for Norlhwood. 

Lady 'Dons player Dotde Porch 
was ill with the flu and Bobbie 
Thomson had bronchitis, which 
Bowden said changed her plans 
because of the lack of depth on 
inside players. 

In the consolation match. 
Gannon spotted Northwood a two- 
point lead at balftioie, 36-34. The 
teams played evenly for the first 
three minutes of the second half, 
then Gannon went on a 10 minute 
tear, including an 18-3 run and 
leading 69-50 at one point. 

Northwood tried to fight back in 
the closing minutes, with Kristin 
McCormick hitting two three- 
pointers and Lisa Cote hitting one 
inside of a minute and a half. 

The Lady Dons started the 
championship game slowly, givmg 
the Miners leads of 6-0 and 11-2 
less than six minutes into the game. 
Bowden called a time-out which 
got the 'Dons back on track. Strong 
performances by Jones, Leah 
Sheets, and Newhard brought them 
to a 24-22 lead with 7;34 to play in 
the half. Tbe first half ended with 
the 'Dons leading 45-38 

The Miners returned from the 
locker room ready to play and went 
on a 9-2 run over tbe first three 
minutes of the second half. The 
Minere followed a six-point IPFW 
run by tying the score at 60 with 
9:45 to play. 

From there. Porch and Newhard 
combined for 18 points, including 
nine straight by Newhard over five 
minutes near the end, Shriver added 
a jumper in the last two minutes 
and Jones sealed the win with two 
free throws with one second left in 
the game. 

Bowden said the bench made a 
big contribution to the win.

The Communicator 



Thursday. December 6, 1994 



Staff Editorial 



The majority of Americans 
believe God exists In some form 
or anoUier God has many names: 
Allah, ImmanueJ, Jehovah or sim- 
ply a higher power. Officially, 
none of these names has been 
mentioned in our public schools. 
Finally, after two generations. 
Republicans have control of 
Congress and hopefully will right 
a heinous policy that has been in 
effect for 32 years. 

Misguided liberals believe "a 
moment of reflection" will satisfy 
the American people. They arc 
wrong: the results from the last 
election should have been an 
epiphany for them. Unfortunately, 
it probably wasn't. Liberals have 



ignored the people for the last 40 
years or so; why should they stop 
now? 

Our currency has the words "In 
God We Trust." Our ancestors 
believed, "We are endowed by our 
Creator." Why has the Lord been 
removed from our schools? An 
overwhelming majority of 
Americans want to see prayer in 
schools. The Republicans' 
Coniraci with America hopefully 
will bring this issue to the floor of 
Congress for debate. Our voices 
may fmally be heard. 

Children need guidance and 
authority; prayer will give Ihem 
the guidance they need. A 
moment of silence is unrealistic. 



Letters to the Editor 



To Ihe Editor: 

I would like to respond to a 
letter written in the 
Communicator on Dec. 1, 1994. 
Joyce A. Stevens is under the 
impression that the Bible is not 
clear on what God thintcs about 
homosexuality. The Bible states 
very clearly what God thinks of 
the homosexual lifestyle and 
how It will be dealt with: 
Corinthians 6:9 &amp; 10. In 
Genesis 19:1-29 anyone can 
read the account of Sodom and 
Gomorrah. They were destroyed 
because of homosexuals. And if 
God has changed his mind 
(which 1 doubt) about homosex- 



uality since Sodom, then he 
owes those people he destroyed 
a very big apology. Also, in 
response to Paul Tupper in the 
same issue. God was unhappy 
enough with homosexuals to 
destroy all those people in 
Sodom. So no matter what sci- 
ence "thinks" they've discov- 
ered about the isthmus. God 
would not make something in 
the womb that He does not want 
to end up in heaven. 
The God I believe in is a loving 
God who loves us all even 
though we are all sinners. In 
God's eyes, one sin is no worse 
than another, normally. 
However, in Corinthians 6:9 &amp; 



10 God does name certain sin- 
ners thai will not "inherit the 
kingdom of heaven" and homo- 
sexuals are on the list. We are all 
expected to repent of our sins 
and then try not to do that sin 
again. However, homosexuality 
is a lifestyle which they don't 
want to slop. I am not judging 
the homosexuals; that is not my 
place to do so. I am only inform- 
ing anyone who thinks as Joyce 
does about what the Bible says- 
You can believe it or not-it is a 
choice everyone can make.

Rebuttal: Republicans invade 



In the words of noted theologian, 
Carl Henry, ■'The notion that a 
moment of silence is the equiva- 
lent of a prayer is a hoax." 

The prayerlessness of our 
schools has contributed to the 
growing decay of our public 
school system and, more impor- 
tanUy, our society as a whole. 

As the recent election showed, 
we are ready for some new fresh 
ideas and the Republican Contract 
with America is what Americans 
need now. Hopefully the GOP 
won't rest on their laurels, or else 
they'll be thrown out of office 
also! 



By Nol T. Bwkley 
Staff Writer 

How can Hie Republicans, who 
claim to be for less government, sup- 
port prayer in schools? The First 
Amendment of the Constitution 
says. "Congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of reli- 
gion." Has Newt Gingnch forgotten 
that he took an oath lo defend the 
Constitution against all enemies, for- 
eign and domestic? 

Newt wants to bring religion 
back into schools, while at the same 



lime spewing tlie tired Republican 
rhetoric of less government. Even 
the newly elected congressman from 
Grabill via Washington D.C. talks 
less government with his mouth 
while his hand is out lo the govern- 
ment for funds to defer his campaign 
costs. 

Hypocrisy in Washington? Say it 
ain't so!! 

This isn't a rani; but, if these Icss- 
governmeni-minded Republicans 
want prayer in schools, they ought to 
talk to their school board. The deci- 
sion on prayer in school must be 



made ai the local les-el, or it will vio- 
late one of the founding principles of 
this nation. 

I-ocal governments are the purest 
form of democracy neM to the refer- 
endum. Only here will the voice of 
the people be heard. If the bureau- 
crats in D.C. circumvent the people. 
thc voices being heard will be the 
lobbyists and moral majority. How 
many Americans want their children 
laught by the likes of Jesse Helms. 
Jerry Falwell and Pat Buchanan? 

Where will the Republican inva- 
sion stop? 



Response to Shizz-Man 



To the editor: 



I a 



g in reference to the 
commentary entitled "There is no 
solution in this movie" written by 
Shizi-Man. I am an African- 
American woman who is currently 
dating a Caucasian male and wish lo 
do this in a logical nunner. I am so 
tired of reading the many viewpoints 
that try to analyze the subject of inter- 
racial relationships. Shizz-Man is just 
recycling the old argument that the 
only reason African- Americans arc in 
interracial relationships is because 
tbey believe that straight hair, narrow 
noses and while skin arc more beauti- 
ful iban curly hair, wide noses and 
dark skin. He slates thai he is going lo 
look at Ibis subject through an Afro- 
ccnuic point of view, and I am going 
to look at it thc same way. 

I myself am nol dating a 
Caucasian male because 1 think his 
skin, hair or nose is any more beauti- 
ful than an African- American man's. 
Many of us who are in these types of 



ships just happened to meet 
; ihought was special who 
just happened lo be of another race, 1 
do agree with him as lo the fact thai 
many of loday's television and maga- 
zine advertiscmenis do portray thc 
itnage thai the straighier your hair and 
lighter your skin tone the more beau- 
tiful, but we as African- Americans 
need lo take these advertiscmenis 
with a grain of salt and realize that 
there is beauty in all races, all skin 
lones and all textures of hair. 

I also don't agree with the point 
in order lo have suong black children 
we musi connect with strong "black" 
men/women. The law states thai if 
you have 1/8 of black blood in you, 
you are considered black, I feel that 
strong black children can be bom if 
you have two strong people in gctKral 
(only one need be black.) Shizz-Man 
also states thai if black males would 
treat the sisters right then there would 
be no reason for them lo run lo the 
male. Well Shizz-Man 1 
ell you that there are a 



majority of black females out Ihcrc 
who are dating white males who have 
nol been misireaicd by black males, 
and as 1 stated above they jusi hap- 
pened lo find that special person 
across the color-line. I basically just 
wanted to say lo ail of you and Shizz- 
Man please stop trying lo analyze 
those of us who have made thc deci- 
sion to spend our time and love with 
someone of Ihe opposite race. Just 
take us for what we are: a couple who 
just happened lo fall in love. 

After rending Ihis letter, many 
may say Ihai I am takinfi this aitlclc 
too personally, but I feci that anyone 
nol in Ihis type of relationship just 
doesn't understand that all any of us 
want is to t&gt;e left atone lo enjoy our 
relationships in peace without so- 
called experts tclhng us the many rea- 
sons we chose this type of relation- 
ship.

Guest writer rebuts editor's 
note, policies of opinions page 



To the Editor: 

Several weeks ago. I submitted 
3 guest commentary to The 
Communicator which its manag- 
ing editor at that lime graciously 
agreed to publish. In the commen- 
tary's original version. 1 related 
the means by which an IPFW 
Student Activity Board co-spon- 
sorship was secured for an off- 
campus lecture by an off-campus 
group two years ago. I also 
described ideological aspects of 
the event; the lecturer. Eustace 
Mullins, delivered a right-wing 
conspiracy spiel on "the New 
World Order" 

1 then provided background 
information on Mullins' anli- 
Jewish writings and affiliations 
with vinilcnily racist organiza- 
tions like the Aryan Nations. 

The original commentary noted 
that thc co-sponsorship was 
secured through a SAB executive 
arrangement at the behest of 
Gregory Callen, IPFW's director 
of studeni activities. In it, 1 also 
noted that the other student mem- 
bers of the board were never 
granted the option of voting on 
whether or not they wanted SAB 
to afTiliate with the event 1 then 
contrasted Callen's administrative 
support for this affiliation, and the 
means by which he effectively 
secured it, with his active lobby- 
ing against proposed SAB events 
which did nol conform lo Callen's 
ideological preferences, and the 
democratic approval process 
which was required for such stu- 
dent initiatives. Accompanying 
the commenlary in its original 
form was a sidebar detailing some 
of the bigoted and paranoid fan- 
tasies disguised as facts in one of 
Mullins' Aryan Nation tracts. 

On Nov, 3, 1 received a mes- 
sage from a Conimunicalor editor 
informing me diat she needed to 
fill some space in that week's 
issue. She said that Ihe sidebar 
would fit the space, but the main 
commenlaiy, with its accompany- 
ing graphics, would not. 



Consequently, 1 agreed to her 
request that the commentary and 
sidebar be split into a two-part 
series. So 1 wrote and relayed to 
the editor some additional expla- 
nations to be added lo the sidebar 
so that it could stand on its own as 
the first in a two-part series. 
When pari one was published in 
the Nov, 10 Communicator, how- 
ever, this necessary context was 
left out and two claims were 
inserted in the published version 
which 1 never made. The first 
erroneous claim was that Greg 
Callen "persuaded the student 
activity board to co-sponsor" 
Mullins' lecture. The second was 
a false assertion in an editor's 
note thai I claimed ". . .Callen 
made the decision lo sponsor 
Mullins' 1992 lecture." 

An astute reader would easily 
recognize the contradiclion 
beiween these two inaccurate 
claims; they undermined the case 
the original commentary made, 
and irritated me because I don't 
like others assigning me illogical 
and erroneous claims which 1 
have not made. 

I recognize that we are all 
capable of errors, bui then again, 1 
wouldn't have to write Uiis letter 
of clarification if The 
Communicator had an honest and 
responsible clarification policy. A 
few years back, a different 
Communicator editor inserted 
another dubious claim in The 
Communicator's letters policy 
that stated. "The Communicator is 
not responsible for errors that 
appear in letters lo the editor." 
Since then, this tragus and irre- 
sponsible policy has remained in 
place, through successive editorial 
regimes. 

If The Communicator is not 
responsible for editing errors in 
the published versions of smdent 
submissions, then who is? I'm not 
quibbling over die trifling errors, 
like the reference I made to "cot- 
spiracy kooks" in the pan-one 
commentary, which mystically 
transformed into "conspiracy 



knocks!', in (he publis|ied , version. 
On minor details like dial, 1 am 
happy lo let others forever wander 
the earth wondering what the hell 
a conspiracy knock is (if you 
receive a conspiracy knock, dare 
you answer (he door? I !) 

Editorial erroni which signifi- 
cantly change the meanings the 
writer was trying to convey, on 
the other hand, should be respon- 
sibly acknowledged and clarified 
through published correction 
notices. I encourage whoever 
takes over the editorial helm of 
The Communicator lo restore 
credibility to the paper's submis- 
sions policy by removing that 
indefensible passage. 

If, on Ihe other hand. The 
Communicator will not reform its 
unusual practice of disavowing 
responsibility for its errors, I 
would appreciate it if The

table in its distribution of uncor-

Commentary: Commercials portray unrealistic products 



By Dave Reynolds 

As an avid lelevision watch- 
er. I have seen many commer- 
cials, the most ridiculous of 
which usually seem lo catch my 
eye. One kind ihal dennilely 
fits thai criterion is the infa- 
mous fast burger commercial. 
As an avid cheeseburger eater. I 
say they are ridiculous commer- 
cials because they often give a 
truly false impression of their 
staple product, hamburgers and 
cheeseburgers. 

The first thing one notices is 
the massive, towering height of 
some of them, especially the 
specialty or double burgere. On 



the lelevision. the monolithic 
structures fill the screen, mak- 
ing those with ignorant minds 
imagine with delight sinking 
their teeth deep into the juicy, 
thick, complete meal in their 
hands. 

I can say. without doubt, thai 
I have never had the pleasure of 
receiving my double cheese- 
burger to find that ! could not 
fit my mouth around it. as 
would probably be the case in 
the spectacular advertisement. 
Mine always seems to be a 
lightly packed, dense clump of 
matter closely resembling the 
plastic wrapper it came in. 

Another misconception 



aroused by the commercials is 
that the hamburgers are fresh 
and carefully and meticulously 
put together. They appear to be 
perfectly symmetrical testa- 
menis to hamburger structure 
engineering- The pieces of 
cheese are perfectly laid and 
look as if they are just barely 
melted. The hearty, porous. 
hamburger patties appear to fill 
the bun, and are themselves 
filled with juices just ready to 
burst out the moment your teeth 
pierce the broiled meat. The 
ketchup, mustard, or some 
"special" sauce oozes out the 
sides between bread, lettuce, 
and patties like the burger is 



overloaded with the flavorful 
condiments. 

Now. when 1 look down at 
mine, that does not seem to be 
the picture I see. What I see is a 
clumsy, normally soggy heap 
of... well. bun. Many limes the 
layers have been slid around 
(during packaging. 1 assume), 
and the cheese is almost always 
off-center. Sure, it oozes out the 
side, one side, about half in, 
half out, dangling, forever 
glued 10 the bun it is overlay- 
ing. When I remove the top half 
of the bun to remove the pick- 
les, which 1 do not care for, 1 
notice that the ketchup and 
mustard portions are placed in a 



pathetic little puddle slightly 
off-center (of course), soaked 
into the bun. The patties appear 
to be about half the size of the 
ones 1 see on television and 
those juices salivating out of 
the meat have been absorbed 
into Ihe bun. now saturated to 
the point where il is a far cry 
from the healthy, stable founda- 
tion of its celebrity counterpart. 
Finally, the burger on camera 
is presented to the audience 
with a steamy glow about it. Il 
looks like the meat has just 
been elevated off the grill and is 
so hot, it would please the 
mouths lined with the most lib- 
eral coating of asbestos. If I 



ever received a burger like that, 
I would be amazed, so accus- 
tomed am I to receiving my 
burger lukewarm. 

1 realize that it is probably 
quite difficult to make such a 
common, convenient food item 
seem appetizing and exciting to 
consume, and that most people 
do not take such commercials 
seriously, but when some com- 
panies decide to make their 
burger so impossibly ai&gt;d ouua- 
geously huge and perfect, it just 
seems humorous to me. when 1 
know that what 1 see Is proba- 
bly not what I am going to get. 



Freshman questions 
librarian's attitude 



Commentary: 

The gentleman's breakfast 



To Ihe Editor: 

I am tresiiman here ai IPFW. 
and when I firsl started attending 
classes, there were many new things I 
had to adapt to However, itiere is 
one tiling I have not been able to 
adjust lo very well: using the Helmke 
Library. I will prove this by telling 
you of an incident that was very 
upseuing to me. I went to the library 
on a Sunday nighi in search of infor- 
mation for a paper I needed to wnle, 
1 went to one of Ihe computers and 
found that the information I needed 
was on microfilm. Well, being the 
freshman thai I am, I hadn't a clue 
how lo work the machine. I then pro- 
ceeded lo ask the librarian how lo use 
il. To my surprise, she gave me a dis- 
gusted look and then stomped into 
the microfilm room while 1 followed 
behind. She did show me how to use 
Ihe machine, but hei inslruclions 
were hurried and unpleasani. She 
acted lUce 1 was annoying her with 
my questions. After she half-hearted- 
ly showed me how to use it. 1 ended 
up making a mistake and rewinding 
the tape too much. For a few minutes 
1 tried to fix it myself because I did 
not want lo have to deal with Ibe 
offensive librarian. When I did ask 
Uw librarian to help me, she said, "I 
can't believe this'. Now I am going lo 
be here all night rewinding this 
film!" I was so shocked at how she 



talked down to me; I thought she waa 
joking. But Ihen it got worse, As 1 
stood there and watched her fix the 
machine, she said lo me in a sarcastic 
tone, "Use thai machine over Ihere; it 
should be easy enough for you lo fig- 
ure out," Ai that point, 1 was really 
mad. not to mention feeling like I 
was SIX years old again. When I was 
finished, I went lo Uie desk to pay for 
my prini-ouls. The librarian said lo 
me, in a sarcastic lone once more, 
"You are done already? I see you 
finally figured il oul," I could not 
believe what had just happened to 
me. I am a student al IPFW and 
should not have lo leave our library 
feeling degraded and stupid, I even 
gave her the benefit of the doubt and 
thought maybe she was having a bad 
day. The next day, I came mio use 
the micro-film again. When the same 
librarian saw mc again she said in a 
dismal tone. "Oh, you're back 
again," like my presence al the 
library is a nuisance. I have heard 
corr^ilaints from many sludcnla from 
IPFW students about a few of our 
librarians, li saddens me that same of 
these people do noi enjoy their jobs 
and can't even find it in theu' hearts 
10 be jusi a lilUe bil nice to us. After 
all. if il wasn't for us. the students of 
IPFW. Uiey would not even have a 
job. 

Beisy Smith 



ByMarkRciTiolds 

A quite annoying thing happened 
10 me one fine morning not so long 
ago. As I was about lo rip open a bon 
of any good gentleman's breakfast of 
choice — delicious, crunchy, sugar- 
coaled breakfast cereal — I happened to 
noUce that ever-present display on the 
front panel of ihe box signaling a frc« 
prize. Being ihe good- naiured man I 
am. I courageously plunged my hand 
into ihc crumbly dry contents of the 
cereal without a second's hcsiiaiion. Il 
was 10 my hitler dismay ihai. afier 
about half a minute of blind searching, 
I had brought up nothing but a grown 
hand covered with colorful crumbs 
and foolishness. I was funous. 

Now, I realize that someone in bis 
college years has no business digging 
into a box of children's cereal for a toy 
only a child could truly enjoy, but who 
could blame me? I was alone. The 
temptation was overwhelming- 

Anyway, as it lumed out, ihe "free" 
prize could not be found within the 
confines of Ihe box ilsclf, but waa only 
attainable through Uie mailing in of 
several UPC symbols, as I was devas- 
lated to find oul. I had no inleniion to 
do ihis, figuring it lo be a waste of 
lime and etforl. I have always haled 
that stupid idea of sending something 
back to the company lo gel a prize not 
worth its weight in cereal, 

I remember the good ol' days of 
my youlh when there was a free prize 
inside every box — good prizes, like a 



quality plaalic loy with mariy exciting 
parts and decals the owner could 
assemble himself; a fine, detailed 
craftsmanship of a matchbox car, 
ready lo ride ihe trails of any common 
breakfasi table; or those wonderfully 
complicated sectel decoder rings. 
They were truly free, inside the box. 
Now, one is expected lo buy twenty or 
ibirly boxes of cereal in order to 
acquire the specified numtjer of UPC 
symbols, plus a hefty shipping fee, all 
for a stupid "Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers" slicker sel. And where will il 
end? Fifty dollars for a pair of 
crayons? One hundred UPC symljols 
for free a irial-size box of the same 
cereal? 

Someone has to put an end lo Ihis 
cheap marketing scheme that has dam- 
aged the lives of thousands of hungry 
young Americans for years. Together, 
we need to make sure that our children 
and further generations will be com- 
pletely furnished and supported with 
government- subsidized free gifts for 
all 10 enjoy in die wonderful years to 
come. Or just eat more oal bran. 



Commentary: Gay holidays 



By Paul T\ipper 

Are holidays tough for you to 
handle in a straight environmem? 
If you are like most of my friends, 
the holidays mean having to 
spend lime with family members 
who you don't really like and/or 
who don't really like you. 
TYadilions have many of us spend- 
ing Christmas lx)red out of our 
skulls wailing for that ultimate 
New Year's party. Here are some 
tips that might help you entertain 
yourself when you are the only 
homosexual in the room; 

1. Take a book with you. This 
could be an excellent chance to 
catch up CHI your poetry reading. 

2. Take a Discman with you. If 
your family insists on having your 
aunt sing Christmas carols off- 
key, headphones and the new 
Crajibenies disc should shut her 
out. 

3. Take a divine gay dish. Tired 
of turkey and ham? Then take 



mm 

S8 languages Available 
RO Cost or ObligadoD 
Call 6:^2:6005 



food that the straight people in 
your life may have never Uied. 
Something exquisite like a 
Waldorf salad or a fruit crepe. 

4. Dominate all of the conver- 
sations, and only talk about gay- 
related items. Families may not 
want to hear il, but you have 
every right to talk about the 
Lesbian/Gay Dinner Dance as 
your cousin Susie does talking 
about the upcoming prom 

5. Wear an AIDS ribbon or a 
gay-rights pin. If you don't want 
to talk about your gayness, at least 
let them see your pride. 

6. Don't go! Who says you 
have lo? If the hohdays are sup- 
posed to be niled with love and 
joy. then why are you in a situa- 
tion that doesn't bring you either? 

There is a constant pressure lo 
spend the holidays with your fam- 



ily. But wouldn't you rather be 
with a group of people that loves 
you for who you are. not because 
you are related to them? You 
choose your friends, but you don't 
choose your family. Don't feel 
like you have to do family things 
if they are not going to let you be 
who you really are.

In search of... the perfect cherry 



Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

Wcii. my (tear friends. iJiis is 
the last 'In Search of. . .' article 
you wili see this semester. So 
whal belter way to end this time 
of perfection, so-lo-speak, than 
to top off the year with cherries 
(pun intended). And so my 
investigation for this weelt look 
me (o the grocery siore again. I 
not only found myself listening 
10 a heinous version of "Lei Ii 
Snow," bul I also realized that 
this particular grocery store 
lacked cherries from wtiich to 
choose. 1 could only find three 
differcnl brands, so as you can 
already lell, this will not be a 
complcle and fair investigation 
for the cherry makers. The 
brands that were available for 
taste icsling were Shoppers 
Value. Ravoriic and Mario (yes. 



you are right in thinking, "...the 
olive makers?") 

Well, the criteria used for the 
lest this week was quite simple: 
We wanted a good tasting, juicy 
and flavorful afteriaste. The rat- 
ing scale was difficult to come 
up with, but pokes should suf- 
fice. One poke is nol worth the 
time of day. Two pokes are 
okay, but, you know, there 
could be room for improve- 
ment. Three pokes mean that 
the cherry deserves to be eaten 
all of the lime! Four pokes, boy 
I tell you, this cherry deserves a 
lot of attention from all cherry 
lovers! Well, let the games 
begin. 

^SHOPPERS VALUE: 
1 POKE 

TTiis sweet, yet not really fia- 
vorfut cherry was lacking a lot 
of things. First of all, the skin 



was very lough and kind of hard 
10 chew through as far as cher- 
ries go. The Juiciness was not 
really there either; it came in 
spuns. For a price of $1.12 a 
Jar, and one poke, don'i waste 
your time. 

TLAVORITE: 
2 POKES 

The second cherry to test was 
a little bit belter than the first, 
but there was still something 
missing in this cherry. It was 
plumper to begin with, yet the 
skin was still lough lo chew 
tfirougJi, ll was quite tasiy and 
Juicy. And jusi costing a few 
cenis less ($1.05), this cherry 
received two pokes because 
improvement was needed. 

*MARIO: 
4 POKES 

The last, but certainly not 



least, product to be tested in 
1994 for the 'In Search of. . ." 
series was cherries from Mario. 
the olive makers. To my sur- 
prise, however, this cherry 
turned out to be the best. 
Overall, ihe cherry was good 
and juicy, the plumpest. The fla- 
vor was out of this world. Even 
though it cost the most, ai $1 .25 
a jar. it definitely deserves four 
pokes because it is amazing! 

1 am actually sony lo see this 
year end, but hopefully you all 
learned some things that you 
would never have ihought of 
before. From cheesecake to 
pickles to whipped cream to 
Blow-Pops lo finally, cherries, 
you now know what is the best 
according to me and my taste- 
testing crew. Have a great holi- 
day season and look this up in 
Ihe dead of winter; you may 
find a bit more than you could 
ever have imagined!

Generations: The 
pass of the baton 



Paul Ttipper 
Stan WrIUr 

Wiih the encouragemcnl of my 
bona fide Trekkle roommate. I 
began waicbing "Star Trek: The 
Nexi Generation" last summer. This 
show is as addiciing as chocolate. I 
began lo ask questions and research 
Ihe show's pasi. I also became 
aitached lo some of the characters on 
the show. This all led to my ewite- 
ment at Ihe release of "Star Trek; 
Generation...." 

The movie is a passing of Ihe 
baiOD, if you will, from Capiain 
James Kirk, the original Enterprise 
capiain, to Capiain Jean -Luc Pi card, 
the current capiain aboard the 
Enterprise. This was a gicai idea, but 
Ihe movie would have been just as 
good if Kitk wasn't even involved. 

The plot of die movie is thai the 
Next Generation crew must stop a 
doclor from another time period 
from reluming lo the tranquil Nexus, 
which would involve murdering 
hundreds of millions of people. 
When Picard can't do it alone, he 
seeks the help of Kirk. 

The special effects can cither help 
or hun 3 movie. In tnie "Star Trek" 
fashion, the special effects arc pre- 
cise and visually breathtaking. 

The movie has many surprises in 



Ihe plot, some too big lo mention in 
a review. One that has been men- 
tioned in recent press is that the 
android Daia moves one slep closer 
to becoming human by installing an 
emotion chip in his "brain." This 
provides comic relief ttiroughoul the 
film. Even though ii's been Data's 
dream io be as human-like as possi- 
ble, I think I prefer him better as an 
emotion-less android. There are 
enough humans aboard (he ship. 

This being the seventh movie of 
the "Star Trek" series, I certainly 
hope that more is made with the 
"T^ext Generation" crew. One of the 
besi things about the "Next 
Generation" series was its ability to 
focus on different members each 
week. I hope that the movies contin- 
ue to do that and not Just focus on 
Captain Picard. 

For those of you die-hard 
Trekkies. this movie will nol disap- 
point. The powers that be did not try 
to avoid iheir fans by skipping over 
all of the trivial information we all 
love so much. There is even a joke 
mentioned that was made in die very 
first episode of the "Next 
Generation" series. Half the fun of 
"Star Trek" is catching ihe refer- 
ences made in the past. See what 
you can find in die movie.

University Women: 

Real life trials and tribulations 



Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

Tlis wceic the spoliigbt lums 
onto a member of the mathematics 
department at IPFW Deb Hall, a 
pre-calculus icacher. has been 
teaching ai IPPA' for the last four 
years and is currently on the tenure 
track. 

Before H^l arrived at IPFW. she 
worlced in the computer program- 
ming field for companies such as 
Control Data, Lincoln and North 
American Van Lines. White she 
was working, she also found the 
lime to icjich one or two courses. 

It wasn't until about four years 



ago that Hall decided ro teach full 
time at IPFW. But il wasn't like 
teaching was a new-found love for 
Hall. 

When she was getting her mas- 
ter's at the Tennessee Technical 
University, she was a teacher's aide 
and literally loved teaching from 
this experience. 

"1 fell in love with teaching," 
explained Hall. 

Most recently, her leaching 
methods have caught on at IPFW. 
Hall was one of the innovators of a 
pilot program that allows math stu- 
dents to take and re-lakc tests over 
until they pass. 

"1 put a lot of time and a lot of 



energy in my classes." Hall com- 
mented. 

This is apparent, since her name 
was submitted to The 
Communicator via an anonymous 
studeniofhcrs. 

Hall said that most of her stu- 
dents are returning adult women 
who are afraid of math in a general 
sense. Because of this. Hall not 
only teaches math for the equations 
and basic operations, she also 
teaches ihc language of mathemat- 
ics. This makes il easier for students 
to understand math. 

Enough about her professional 
hfe; her personal life is also worth 
noting. Just this last weekend, H^l 



was in Las Vegas for a couniry- 
weslem dance competition which 
her team happened to win. The 
group is referred to as the 
'Hardwood Shiners.' 

As for her family. Hall is a sin- 
gle mom raising anll-year-old 
daughter who happens to not appre- 
ciate math like her mother. 

"1 try really hard lo be a great 
mom." Hall said. 

We. as a campus, should be 
Uiankful for such dedicated educa- 
tors as Hall. There are other women 
here at IPFW who are just as dedi- 
cated, and this article is for them.

Fort Wayne's music stores: Investigation results are in ^^ 



PaulTupper 
Staff wriUr 
Fort Wayne has a variety of 
music stores to suit everyone's 
needs. Bui which music store is 
right for you? Being a music addict, 
1 thought 1 would be the best person 
to investigate. Here's what I found 
out when 1 looked into The Twist &amp; 
Shout Collector's Store, Best Buy. 
Blockbuster Music and Musicland. 

The Tw i St (^ 
Shout Collector's Store 

•For Ihe money-iighl college stu- 
dent, this place is for you. if you 



don't mind that the merchandise 
was previously owned. You can 
walk out with CD's for as little as 
S4.99. And if you buy five, they 
will deduct SLOO from each CD, 
The friendliness of the employees is 
a big plus. 

However, most of the music is 
older and not everything you may 
want can be found. 
Best Buy 

•For newer music at the best 
price, Best Buy is the best! Most 
tides range from S8.99 to S13.99, 
On some occasions, you may Hnd a 



CD for S4.99 that only you would 
ever wanL 
Blockbuster Music 

■This is the most beautiful music 
store in town. You can listen to any 
song of any disc by any artist at any 
lime. Some of the bigger, newer 
titles are ready for you to sample, 
but any album can be requested. If 
you are not used lo the layout of the 
store, some music may be hard to 
fmd.

they can get it for you. You can

Taco Bell leaves 

By Laura Beer&gt; 
Staff Writer 



Taco Del) stopped serving 
IPFW students on Thursday, 
Nov. 3, The Taco Bell section was 
located in The Fort in ihc base- 
ment of Walb Union. 

Candy Hagar, direcior of The 
Fort, said, 'Taco Bell left because 
they needed to and not because of 
any problems wilh The Fori," 

She said ihe two reasons for the 
closing were the sales were not 
what Taco Bell had expected and 
labor reasons. 

Taco Bell was not making the 
money they thought ihey would be 
making at the campus, and they 
needed Ihc employees at other 
restaurants, according to Hagar, 

A representative for Taco Bell 
said they left not because of the 
money or because they were 
understaffed. Money was not the 
issue, even though ihcy were not 
making a great profit, according to 
her, 

Taco Bell left because the com- 
pany started a new program— the 
45 -cent tacos, 

Taco Bell ser^^ed a variety of 
their regular-menu items on the 
campus, ITie Fon will now serve 
their own sofl lacos for 65 cents 
and soft tacos supreme for 85 
cents. 

Taco Bell said they would con- 
sider coming back to The Fort and 
The Fort said thai they would wel- 
come Taco Bell back to the cam- 
pus, 

Hagar said they would not try 
to compete with Taco Bell, but 
would continue to serve popular 
menu items, such as the (acos and 
nachos.

Baker wanted an immediate 
vote to allempi lo override King's 
veto of Ihe bill. He said ihe 
IPSGA previously did not table a 
bill to be voted on later, IPSGA 
senate member Terry Griitun said 
six sennte members had been pan 
of IPSGA for only six weeks, so 
an argument based on precedence 
was invalid. 

Grimm then motioned lo close 
discussion. The move lo override 
the velo was defeated wilh a vote 
of 1 "yes". 7 "no", and 3 absten- 
tions. 



mittee member, says thai the rea- 
son so many people attend the gala 
is that it gives homosexuals a 
chance "lo take iBc person they 
really wanted to the prom." Just 
like a prom, a phoiographer was 
available to capture the evening 
for those who wanted lo remember 
the night. 

Money was raised not only in 
ticket sales, but also through the 
sales of memorabilia by local and 
international stars. Some of the 
ilems in tbe silent auction included 
an autographed cassette of Anita 
Baker, a poster of Mrs, Doubtfire 
signed by Robin Williams, and a 
script of The Mary Tyler Moore 
Show signed by the star herself. 

Nexi year's dance will be held, 
again, at ihe Grand Wayne Center 
and is set for die first Saturday of 
October.
