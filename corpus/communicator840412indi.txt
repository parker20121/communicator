Managing Editor 

With Students' government elections about to take place, the Karris ad-

Harris said he ran for Student body president because "I felt Ihst I could achieve 
some things for students' government and studentsat IPHV as n whole." 

During his campaign. Harris p'omised to increase communication between the 
student body and students' government and to Increase parking availability. He

Harris feels his administration has adequately fulfilled these promises Com- 
munication has been increase) through Ihc students' govcrruneot newsletler.

Harris said that this has become a vital tool for him while represcntbig 10.000 

Tlie parking availability has been Increased by ISO B spaces in a new lot by the 
river Harris said that students' government will need to stay on top ol this Issue 
iKcause the new lot is not definitely going to t&gt;ecnme a permanent loL 

Harris feels the third promise began to be iullllled w-ith the Okloberfest, spon- 
sored by SUBOG this &gt;'ear. 

Other projects that Harris Is proud ol includes Ihe study group form that 
students' government developed. Tills (orm was a tool to help stiitients organize 
Iheir own groups lo study with hi their particular class. 

Tlie Tirsl students' government basketball game was held this past January 
Harris said this game was an efleitive tool whici

"The participants in this adminislration are the best people I have seen In this

Steve Souers, stiSail body vice-president said, "Students' government has 
pursued a number of issues Ihis year, whichhavebcen beneficial too wide variety 
of students Every member has endeavored to serve the students in the way he or 
shelhinksisbest." 

"So many neat projects have been started," Hams said "Without proper 
leadership, guidancenndcnlhusiosmintherutureall may fall apart." 

Besides the success Harris achieved, some ol his promises did nol malcriallie. 
For example, increasing free legal aid to students. Harris also hoped to start an 
effective campaign lor a swimming pool and a fine arts building to be built on 
campus. He said that he hopes to continue his work wnth students govemmenl to 
make these things happen. 

Harris said of Ihe student body presidency. 'It was what 1 lapecled and a little 
more. The presidency is as much as you want to moke It." 

"1 am confident that I worked hard and 1 hope that students' government is a 
little betlETofl." Harris said. 

Harris plans lo stay involved in students' government, but nol In the posilion of

Tornado season 



Tornado season is upon us in northern 
Indiana. While Allen County hasn't been 
hit with a severe lomatJo in recent years, 
the surrounding counties have. 

IPFW now has a tornado warning 
system, Tlie system is locked in the 
campuH-wlde fire alarm system. 
Whenever there is a tornado warning in 
the area, the system will sound a series 
ot short blasts. When the warning is 
given, occupants ot the various buildings 
are to go lo the basement or ground noor 
ot that building. 

Ifa good that IPFW has a warning 
system, however, many people probably 
slill won't know what lo do. Pink sUps. 
tacked to a bulletin board, telling oc- 
cupants what to do may not be enough in 



case of a tornado. Things are lacked to 
bulletin boards all over campus that 
never get looked at. The Communicator 
is trying to get the word out on tor- 
nadoes, but It may not be enough, since 
everyone doesn't read The Com- 
municator anyways. 

In the tuture. the administration 
should publish emergency procedures in 
the bulletin and in the student handbook. 
The administration should also ash the 
students' government lo assist in gelling 
the word oul on (omado procedures. 

Tornadoes are a destructive act of 
nature and we wouldn't want to see 
anyone killed or injured because the 
university hadn't done enough to 
ensure that everyone knew what lo do.
