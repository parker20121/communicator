As presideni, Newman is responsible for 
getting ihe siudenis lo ser\'e on various adminis-

'#"■&gt;&gt; &gt; "Student govcrn-

'"^'Ricvi^^ more than 5-10 people lo 

vote," Newman said. 
Newman has previous experience serving as 
president for Sons of the American Legion. 

Schroeder replaced Newman as vice presi- 
dent after Newman was elected presideni. 

There is nothing in the IPSGA constitution 
dealing with the vacancy of a vice president and 
the process to elect one. 

The rewriting of a constitution is a lengthy 
process, particularly concerning how a vice- 
president iselecied. 

Schroeder ran against three other candidates 
for the position. He was voted in at an IPSGA 
meeting on Sept. 21. 

As vice-president. Schroeder serves as a 
mediator between the presideni. the senate and 
the students. He also conducLs Senate meetings. 
Schroeder has been a member of the Senate 
for three semesters and has served as social and 
rash chairman for the Beta Sigma Phi Fraternity 
at Purdue. 

Schroeder and Newman have several new 




projccLs that ihey are wroking lo implement. 

Some of Ihe most important projects ihey 
are working on deal with services for students 
and rewriting student government's 
constitution. 

In order for students lo save money, the sen- 
ate is trying to make a website where students 
can sell used books and bargain the prices with 
each other. 

Another project Ls per- 
sonal student websites. This 
is a project that is being 
attempted with assistance 
from the Informal' 
Technology Program 
Commitiee, 

A homepage system 
similar to Angel Fire would 
be available, where students I 
could follow guidelines for | 
the construction of their 
pages. 

Another m 
the Student Calculator 
Program for students in _ 
math classes 153 and 154. 
This can save a student up 
to S75. 

SludenLs can rent the 
calculator for S20 to S25 
instead of buying one for a 
SIOO. 

When the student is Tm- 
ishcd with the classes, he or 
she can simply return the 
calculator 

However, if students 
fail to reium the calculator, 
they will have to pay full 
price for the calculator.

Chief Reponer 

Fourth district Congressman Mark 
Souder and his opponent in the upcom- 
ing election, Mark Wehrle, met (or a 
debate on Wednesday. Oct. 21, in Walb 
Union to discuss their positions and 
answer questions posed by area 
journalists. 

Souder is close to completing his 
second term in Congress, 

This is Wehrle's first lime in a gov- 
ernment election. 

Both opponents had many opinions 
lo express about current is.sues such as 
the dnig war, federal government, educa- 
tion, hale crimes. President Bill Clinton 
and Monica Lewinsky, losing American 
jobs to foreign countries and ihe future of 
Social Security. 

"I think that the first thing we need to 
do with any surplus is to make sure that 
Social Security is assured of," Wehle 
said. "I'm optimistic that the surpluses 



will continue." 

Although Souder did not disagree 
with this, he explained the problems 
behmd Social Security. 

The money is available, he said. It's 
only a matter of deciding whai to do with 
it until it is needed. 

■'If the economy is growing and the 
income is growing you have some bal- 
ance and abihty lo make sure that there 
will be some funds there for Social 
Security and Medicare if we're cau- 
tious." Souder said. 

"The problem is that no Congress 
has ever, when diey have a surplus, not 
spent iL It is not easy to figure out what 
10 do with the 90 billion dollars that on 
paper we have in Social Security," he 
added. 

The two men were ^so asked about 
iheir opinions of the federal government 
and the schools. 

"I've been a supporter of CUnion's 
wanting to spend money to set up nation- 
al tests, 1 think he's on the right track, 
and fortunately he fought and got money 
to put more teachers in schools." Wehrle 



said. 'I think that the children in this 
country deserve ihe very best." 

Souder said money going to the 
schools should still be left to the state to 
administer, as the Constitution says. 

"1 was, in fact, on a bill. . , intro- 
duced by Bill Baxion for 100,000 new 
teachers," Souder said. 

"But that money was to be driven 
down to state level and administered 
though the slate level," said Souder. 

Relating to the recent hate crime 
against college student Mallhew 
Shepard, both men were asked their 
opinions of how punishment should be 
handled for hate crimes. 

"It's a terrible tragedy. Nobody, 
regardless of whether I believe their 
behavior Ls inappropriaie or appropriate. 
should be beaten up and killed, or (or 
that maier, tormented." Souder said.

IPFW and United Way 
work together 



by Carrie Anne Leathers 

Chief Reponer 

Relations beiweeri the United Way and 
IPI^ continue after three successful years. 

This year's campaign will be "Doing Good 
Works," 

By participating with the United Way, IPFW 
is able to do good works in the conmiunity and 
develop more successful community 
relationships. 

"The percenugc of employees who give to 
the United Way becomes a visible, public mea- 
sure of IPFW's willingness lo invest in our com- 
munity." Chancellor Michael Wartell said. "Our 
effor: is noted and remembered by those whom 
we ask to support and invest in us." 



"IPFW students and employees are amtmg 
the thousands who benefit both direcdy and 
indirccdy from the many services provided by 
the United Way agencies." Wanell said. 

During the United Way's Day of Caring Ibis 
year, several IPFW employees spent the day as 
volunteers and others at IPFW give time and 
help to United Way agencies. 

In past years, IPFW was awarded die first 
United Way Partners Award. In the preceding 
year was IPFW was also recognized for having 
an ouuiianding campaign. 

Last year, IPFW maintained its previous 
year's level of giving arrf Wanell hopes the uni- 
versity will be able to maintain iis status. 

"Such professional and personal service 
activities reinforce our image as a tnjc commu- 
nity partner." Waitell said. 



ID improves 
cultural diversity 



by Car rie Anne Lcalhers 
ChieJReponer 

Beginning this spring, imple- 
mentation of a plan to improve 
diversity at l.U. Bloominglon will 
begin 

Plan.', for improving diversity 
began after 1 3 rcconmiendations on 
Ihe subject were made ai a news 
conference on Thursday. Oa. 1. 

Charlie Nelms, special assistant 
lo university Presideni Myles 
Brand, announced the 
recommendations. 

The recommendations were 
approved by Kenneth Gros Louis, 
lU Bloomington's chancellor. 

Aficr studying the LU. 
Bloominglon campus for several 
months, Nelms and a team of 



national experts were able to put 
together the report 

One of their main points is the 
idea of establishing a new admini.s- 
irative structure which would con- 
sist of a vice chancellor (or acade- 
mic support of diversity who would 
oversee three associate vice 
chancellors. 

Each of the three associates 
would be assigned lo specific pro- 
grams and duties relating lo minor- 
ity recruitment, retention and 
graduation. 

"In the final analysis," Nelms 
said, "lU's success in achieving this 
diversity effectiveness will not be 
measured in terms of promises 
made or recommendations made, 
but in tenns of effecting cultural 
change over a period of time." 



Exhibit depicts women's experiences

Photo Edilor 

The exhibil, "A Woman's 
World," is on display in the lobby of 
the Fine Arts Building. 

The an, which expresses 
diverse views women have concern- 
ing the world, was created by 
exhibit coordinator Dana Goodman. 

"The exhibil also has almost a 
negative undertone, that of certain 
things that arc expected of women 
which they are not appreciated for," 
Goodman said. 

A photograph of a poncho, at 
right, is part of a series of artistical- 
ly-enhanced garments crafted by 
artist Kaihy Johnson Bowles. 

The poncho holds two pictures 
and a letter that reads; "Dear Na Na, 
I like my poncho very much. I love 
you. How are you. I have a doll at 



school. I have a book. Love, 
Kathy." 

Bowie's portion of the exhibit 
details times in her own life. 

For example, she included the 
hospital gown she wore during die 
birth of her child. 

The gov/n is covered with snap- 
shots of her giving birth. 

"My work is intended to be 
painfully honest ai confronting for- 
mer selves, attitudes, and events." 
Bowles said 

In this sense, the work becomes 
a trigger for the personal refieciion 
of the exhibition viewers. 

The bapc is that viewers can 
find one or more parallels in their 
own lives. 

The other artists in the "A 
Woman's World" exhibit are Hai chi 
Jihn, who rcfiects on the truths o( 
being a good Chinese woman, and 
Linda Marsion-Reid, who concen- 
trates on the American wedding cer- 
emony.

Topic: 

Voting 

What we think: 

If you don't vote, then 
you have no reason to 
complain. 



Voiing is as American as cheny pie 
and hasehall. 

As of laie, more people have been pay- 
ing aiieniion lo baseball Uian to the issi]cs 
local candidates for office are debating, 

Candidates in Indiana only have so 
much money lo iiy to gel you to see ihem 
between the innings. 

They shouldn't have lo squeeze for air- 
lime on local television stations. You 
should be thirsting to find out what the 
candidates have lo say. 

You should run out and pick up ihe 
paper everyday to find oui what they are 
saying so thai you can make an educated 
decision on who controls our way of life. 

There are a lot of people out there who 
do not vole We would like lo lell ihem lo 
get up off iheir rears, find out about the 
candidates and make a stand for what they 
feel is imponani. 



If you feel that voiing is not 
representing your views, you 
are wrong. In the small area that 
we live in, getting jusi a few 
votes logciher can sway the out- 
come of an election. 

Every vote really does count 
when only a small percentage of 
the population votes. 
Imagine adding thousands of 
new voiet^ to the pool of people 
thai already vote. 

The results will be more rep- 
resentative of what our society 
really feels is right and who 
should be leading us into the 
next millennium. 

Even ihough you may feel 
insignificant, your vote really does matter. 

Why should you vote? Voiing allows 
you 10 express the way you feel the gov- 
ernment should be run and n also allows 
you to represent your views on issues you

elected by good 
citizens who do not 
vote."

feci are important. 

This allows you lo have a say in what 
happens wiih our govemmenL 

Ii is supposed to be a government by 
the people and for the people, but when 
you don't cast your vote, you break 
down the system. 

You do not add to the pohtical dia- 
logue. 

When you do vole, you add your ideals 
to the stream of American political 
thought. 

In this day and age everyone has 
someihing to whine about regarding our 
government. We feci the only people 
that have a reason to gripe are ihe people 
who do vole. 

We're tired of people who gnimble 
about the government and all of the 
scandals, and yet don't bother to vote. If 
you don't contribute to our system of 
government, ihen you have no reason lo

Nov. 3 marks the end of 
another elecioral season. It also 
marks the beginning of the nitly- 
gritiy process of policy making. 
Only after an election do we 
know who will be in a position 
to make and shape legislative 
policy in our state. Ironically, it 
will be those who emerged vic- 
torious Nov. 3 who wilfbe asked 
to address the issue of campaign 
finance reform. 

At first glance, these legisla- 
tors appear to be the same per- 
sons who benefit from a system 
which forces candidates to raise 
huge sums of money to run 
viaole campaigns. Thus is why 
the post-election period is so 
important. Only after the process 
of fund-raising has endea can 
we hope legislators will roll up 
their sleeves and discuss alterna- 
tive ways to finance and conduct 
elections, then act to implement 
changes which will increase 
public faith in the democratic 
process. 

Elected officials must see 
evidence of popular support for 
campaign finance reform, how- 
ever. Without this, nothing will 
change. Northeast Indiana resi- 
dents have the opportunity to 



show this support Friday. Nov. 
13. On that day, the CAC 
Education Fund will host a town 
hall meeting in the auditorium 
of the Allen County Public 
Library. 900 Webster Street, in 
downtown Fort Wayne from 2:30 
p.m. to 4:30 p.m. 

The public will have the 
opportunity lo hear specific 
solutions to the problems creat- 
ed when big money is perceived 
as dominating the political 
process. Citizens will have the 
chance to tell their representa- 
tives what they feel should be 
done to restore faith in the 
democratic process. With sup- 
port from the IPFW community. 
Friday the 13th can become a 
good day for democracy, and a 
Bad day for politics as usual.

Wiccan Support 



To the Editor. 

Your Thursday. Oct, 22. issue 
(Vol. 31. #8) included a feature tilled 
"Welcome lo the Temple of 
Luna(cy)," written by staff writer 
Vincent Garcia. In his feature. Mr. 
Garcia reviewed websites of a sea- 
sonal nature. One was a site of facts 
about Wicca. While il is true that 
few pieces written are agreed (o by 
all readers, and no piece avoids 
offending someone, I believe in this 
case Ihe editorial staff could have 
done a better job. 

Wicca is a viable, accepted and 
legal religion in this and many other 
countries Had your writer chosen lo 
target his winicism at Catholicism, 
say discussing the cannibalistic rite 
of Eucharist, or the interesting but 
hypocritical policy concerning idol 
worship and Ihe crucifix, your edito- 
rial staff may have found it more 
prudent to cui this particular bit 
from his piece. Most likely, any 
piece that might seriously offend 
members of the Christian, Islamic or 
other well-recognized religions 
would nol likely see print. 

Mr. Garcia is welcome lo his 
opinions, as is anyone. Such opin- 



ions, Ihough, should be regulated lo 
the editorial section, not the features. 
I would suggest that the ediiorial 
staff use better judgement in the 
future, and that Mr. Garcia take 
more lime to research his topics " "•'^ 
before subjecting us to hisopinionsi.'^jli 

For Mr, Garcia's benefit, the 
Sears Tower disappearing would fall 
under the category of illusions. 
Gaining .'ree cable would be due to a 
fear of technological or bureaucratic 
magic. 

Aliester Crowely is credited with 
beginning the occultisi fad of writing 
magic as "magick," and natural 
magic is in the same psychological 
arena as the more popular ritual of 
prayer, with similar intent, and pos- 
sibly more reliable results- 
Should Mr. Garcia take a serious 
interest in the subject, he may feel 
free to contact me 1 would be more 
than willing lo answer his questions 
and point his research in a solid 
direction.

Jason Sorrell

What's Weak this Week 



by Dennis Donahue 
Columnist 




I've been lold I watch a 
hii of television. When I'm 
noi working or studying, 
there is television. 
Television is noi as safe as 
you think. It makes a lot of 
people very ignorant; more 
Ignorant than they already 
.arc. 

Television can be a very 
educational tool. It can help 
us learn about the world we 
live in. But television does- 
n't cater to those who want 
to learn. Television is 
destructive and violent. 

It can help people make 
irrational decisions, like 
who to vote Jor! The box 
you stare into every night is 
J hypnotic light of confu- 
sion. How bad is it going to 
gel? 

First of all, I watch TV 
responsibly; that is, I don't 
take it seriously. Secondly, 
I don't watch a lot of violent 
programs, except for maybe 
NYPD Blue, and of course, 
sports like hockey and foot- 
ball. 

Don't sit there and tell 
me football isn't violent 
either. Ask Joe Theismann 
or Dennis Byrd. I do try to 
avoid most of the mind 
numbing gratuitous violence 
that the networks present to 
us on a daily basis. It just 
doesn't work for me. 

It amazes me how much 
violence we actually accept 
as a nation. We love seeing 



blood, guns, rape, and 
abuse. The ratings prove it. 
We live what we see I guess. 
Don't get me started on the 
cable industry, or talk 
shows. 

Before T contradict 
myself a hundred times In 
this piece, let me just say 
ihis-ielevision can get bet- 
ter. It isn't a total loss. 
Some shows are entertaining 
and simple. We have a lot of 
comedy out there on the air- 
waves. We have about ten 
sports channels, not includ- 
ing the Golf Channel. 

We have very good pub- 
lic stations which are, by the 
way, supported by the view- 
ers and some private fund- 
ing. There's A&amp;E and the 
Discovery Channel, both 
offer great educational and 
informative viewing. 

Most children's pro- 
gramming is pretty safe, but 
some of it reeks of market- 
ing and greed, i.e. Barney. I 
don't have children because 
I wouldn't be able to afford 
all of the toys related to 
television programming. 

Aside from all of the bad 
TV, let's touch on one of the 
worst things television gives 
us: advertising. 

Could we be more insult- 
ed? I guess we will buy 
about anything if it is 
dressed up enough. Let me 
give you some examples. 
The Pringles ads. Who gets 



If you Ii.si&lt;-n 10 this kind of guitar on

Song of Solomon." 




that liappy when they cat? 
Do we just want to break out 
into a little song and dance 
as we enjoy this artificially 
flavored snack? » 

How about ANIf 
McDonald's ad? Did some- 
body say. ..stupid? At least 
the Memos campaign was 
trying to be funny, they 
knew advertising was 
cheesy. 

And I see ads for long 
distance carriers at least 
five or six times a day. How 
many long distance compa- 
nies are there? And is it me. 
or does all the cool music 
from the sixties and seven- 
ties appear in ads for cars, 
hamburgers, and Just about 
everything else the 
"boomers" are buying? 

Remember when NIKE 
used the Beatles 
"Revolution" about ten 
years ago? It was the begin- 
ning of the end. 
Advertisement time isn't 
purchased to sell you things. 
Ads are there to make you 
feel good about what you're 
already driving, eating, and 
wearing. 

And then there is sex. We 
ask ourselves why children 
are becoming pregnant at 
such an early age. How can 
an eight-year-old molest his 
five-year-old neighbor? 
Where would they learn this 
horrible offense other than 
from the great television, at 



school? 

Oh my, what have we 
done wrong? I don't know, 
maybe Melrose Place and 
Dawson's Creek had some- 
thing to do with it. Tell ,ne 
you didn't watch television 
when you were young for a 
little curious stimulation. 
Maybe that is why some of 
you watch these shows 
today. 

I see a lot of sex in the 
sitcoms too. Sleeping 
around isn't funny. Getting 
AIDS isn't funny at all. I 
notice they are finally show- 
ing condom ads on TV. I 
think this is okay, isn't it? I 
mean, shouldn't we promote 
safe sex? People have been 
having sex for a long time. 
Now it can kill you. Creepy 
isn't it? 

Television has come a 
long way from its juvenile 
stage. We have gone from 
The Honeymooners to pay- 
per-view adult channels in 
just about fifty years. 

Television has covered 
war. moon landings, assassi- 
nations, and royal weddings. 
We have learned about 
weather systems heading 
our way by weather chan- 
nels warning us of danger. 
We have been able to follow 
our elections and have 
known before we went to 
sleep that our candidate had 
lost. 

We grew up on '^Ed 



Sullivan," "The Walton's," 
and "Wei come Back 
Kotter," We had to watch 
Geraldo Rivera open an 
empty safe. 

We watch really boring 
Super Bowls. We watch pro- 
fessional wrestling, know- 
ing that it isn't real. We 
watch our political leaders, 
promising us better things. 

We try to escape and get 
away for an hour or two. We 
will watch pretty much any- 
thing once, just because we 
arc curious, or bored, or stu- 
pid. 

I admit, television is 
only as bad as you make it. I 
ihink we need to protect our 
children from some of the 
terrible programming that 
the networks give us. 

I Ihink a lot of people 
take television too serious- 
ly. Maybe I'm one of them. 
Oh well, 1 could always go 
back to reading books. 

LOSER OF THE WEEK- 
NBA basketball players. Are 
you kidding me? These 
babies say they reed to play 
charity games so they don't 
go broke? 

Maybe the leather pack- 
age for your Lincoln 
Navigator put you over the 
top. 1 hate pro basketball 
anyway. Professional 
sports. ..what are we gonna 
to do with ya'? 

Be nice, have a spooky 
weekend.

I^M Tuesday nighi 1 had ihc 
pleasure of checking oui iwo new 
up and coming bands. The 
ScrcamJn' Cheeiah Wheelies &amp; 
Bare Jr. Both hail from Nashville, 
Ihe home of counUy music. 

1 was not loa surprised in sec 
Ihai nol a whole loi of people 



powerful. 

Bear Jr's album is extremely 
well-wriiien and arranged, which 
complements Bobby's vocals per- 
fectly. Bare Jr's stage presence was 
intense and had a lot of attitude. 

Guitarist Grimey. as he is so 
lovingly known, jams in his favorite 
thing to wear, his silk jammies!!! 
Bassist Dean Tomasek made my 
chest pound with his hard-hitting 
bass lines, and dulcimer player 
Tracy Hackney added a fuller sound 
to the live show with loud, crashing 
accompaniment to the guitar sound. 

("&gt;ripinally the dulcimer was a 
blucgr;i.ss insuumcni, which is evi- 
dent on "Patty

showed up for this concert. Now 
that Pierre's is finally booking some 
decent acts iti the near future, things 
will hopefully change. 

Bare Jr. opened their set with 
"Nothing, Belter To Do," a melodic 
bluesy song, while clad in polyester 
print shins that enuded their eclec- 
tic fashion sense. 

Their debui album "Booiay" 
was just released in September. This 
album is exceptional. Bare Jr. 
jammed on "You Blew Me Off," a 
heavier rock tune, and "Give 
Nothing Away," one of my personal 
favorites, poured out of the speakers 
with a heightened intensity that can 
only be described as "spontaneous." 

Bare Jr. has been together for 
Lwo . ycars_This band is extremely 
talented; the lead singer Bobby 
Bare. Jr was nominated for a 
Grammy when he was seven years 
old. He is a scas-oned professional 
whose voice is intoxicaiingly 



sure to look 
for them in 

ic of Rolling 



the December 

Stone. 

Bare Jr. is set to hit radio in 
January 1999. The first single off 
their debut album. "You Blew Me 
Off," is undoubtedly destined to be 
a number one hit. 

The band also performed a song 
that docs not appear on their new 
album called "You're Ruining My 
Life," which Bobby calls a love 
song. It will appear on the new TV 
sitcom "Cupid." 

The band believes that once 
they receive radio exposure, more 
people will turn out for their Qve 
perfomiances. Their album is an 
ode to heartbreak and dysfunctional 
relationships. 

The best thing about it is that 
we all can relate to it in some way 
or another It shares the torment and 
aggression thai makes music stand 
up over lime.

the first few songs, the crowd got 
into the groove and ultimately had a 
great time. 

Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies 
rose to national acclaim in 1994 
when they were featured on the 
Horde Tour with Blues TiaveJerLmiu 

'ITie first single off their new 
album, called "Boogie King." is 
featured on the movie soundtrack 
ionhimtw Bride of Chucky movie, 
which was a loud catchy song with 
a killer bass drum kick and good 
rhythm. 

The Wheelies also did their own 
version of a classic Dr. John tune 
called "Right Place. Wrong Time," 
which displayed this band's musical 
versatility. 

Pierre's did not find the noise 
level. as ple.\sing as 1 and made the , 
band tum down their amplifiers. 
because ihcy like to play really 
loud. I must admit that it made the 
hair on the back of my neck stand 
up. 

The Screamin' Cheetah 
Wheelies are a soulhcm blues rock 
explosion. Singer Mike Fanis has 
been called a male "Janis JopUn." 
His vocals were harmonious and 
projected a lot of feeling, which 1 
think more bands need today. 

Overall, Iwth of these bands 
rocked the house at Pierre's 
Tuesday night. These southern boys 
have got it goin' on!! They certain- 
ly know how 10 entertain an audi- 
ence to the fullest extent. 

! recommend catching either 
one of these bands the next time 
they arc in town, or even close to 
town. Both bands will be touring 
non-stop throughout the U.S. in 
1999.

sorry about your luck, but you can

Feoiurex FMitor 

A cold November day found Bob 
playing rootball wiUi one of his kids. 
liis kid's friends, and their faibeni. 

Games like Uiis had become 
cusloniaiy for the men as winter first 
showed signs of iu rapid approach, 
and in their opinions there was no 
better way for the guys to spend a 
Saturday afternoon. 

Teams were divided out equally 
widi three adults and their three chil- 
dren on each team, and Bob's team 
•iecmed to be the best assembled of 
the two. His team was hammering 
the other team. 

Bob and his son James ended up 
on the same team, as eupccied. and 
Bob couldn't have been prouder of 
his son. 

He was only 14 and he was 
holding his own against the boy's 
father they had assigned to block 
him, even knocking him down on a 
few oceasioas. 

James was a quarterback for his 
school due to his siw; and intelli- 
gence, but he could basically play 
any position he wanted to. James 
was definitely Bob's boy. 

The sun crept slowly out from the 
overcast sky, and Bob's team once 
again had the bad. 

They were up 21-0 already and 
dicy were, as usual, put in a good 
position to scon; Bob patted his son 
on the back and congratulated him 
for getting the tackle that turned the 
ballovcr 10 them. 

It seemed as though he had been 
doing diat all day, but to Bob ii 
would still be worth praising his son 
even if Jiimes had been uckling peo- 
ple all week. 

James was the epitome of every- 
diing Bob had suived to be when he 
was younger, and Bob wasn't aftaid 
to show his admiration. 

As Bob cleared his head and 
grabbed the ball, die man behind 
him yelled "Hikel" and Bob threw 
the ball back to him. 

He then ran alongside his son 
with ail of the energy of a 39-year- 
old. ducking and dodging die person 
defending him and trying to stay 
open long enough for a pass to be 
thrown. 

As the ball left the hands of the 
quancrback. Bob froze and fell to 
the ground. His body was filled wiih 
pain and, looking around, he was in 
a different place. 

His childhood friend Luke was 
standing next to a tree with a strange 
look on his face. Bob tried to get up 
to get a closer look, but he couldn't 
move. He tried to call out to Luke, 
but couldn't speak. 

Luke soon turned around and 
walked behind the tree and, as Bob's 
senses returned to him. he found 
himself in an ambulance with his 
wife and some medics. Bob was on 
the way to die hospital and he had 
no idea why, 

ITie drugi soon set in and Bob 
drifted off lo a drciunless sleep, only 
(o be awakened by a doctor entering 
his hospiuil room with a chan in 
hand. 

"Your tests came back inconclu- 
sive, Bob, so we're going to have to 



keep you in here a few days," his 
doctor said, "We'll try to ;*e what's 
going on and get you back home as 
soon as we can. Are you still feeling 
any painT' 

Boh groggily tried to sit up in his 
bed. only to find the pain kept him 
stationary "Yes, I am. as a matter of 
fact. What happened to me?" Bob 
asked in confusion. "One minute 1 
was playing football with my son, 
and the next I'm riding around in an 
ambulanc«. Where's my wife?" Bob 
asked, growing testier by the 
minute. 

"She just went home to get .some 
things to make your stay as comfort- 
able as she could," his doctor 
replied. '!You mean you don't 
remember anything that happened 
after you fell'.*" 

"No, I don't remember any of iL 
What's wrong with me?" 

"That's odd. but don't worry, 
Bob. We intend to find out what's 
wrong in die next day or so. I'll have 
die nurse come in with a sedative 
diat should lake the pain away. Rest 
up. It could be a long night for you." 
Just as the doctor had promised. 
a nurse came in widi a syringe as 
soon as the doctor had left the room. 
Bob was puzzled as to what was 
going on and tried not to show it too 
much as the nurse rolled him over. 
"Relax, Bob. This will only hun for 
a second." 

The nurse was wrong, as the next 
few days would prove to be an end- 
less nightmare for Dob. He under- 
went just about every kind of test 
imaginable, every form of tonure 
ever devised in a medical school. 

After three days, he resolved 
dial whatever it was dial was wrong 
with him couldn't be nearly as bad 
as what he was being forced lo 
undergo at die hands of his doctors. 
It was thus with great anticipa- 
tion that he heard that die doclor 
who had originally greeted him 
upon his arrival would be in with his 
test results and die news that he 
could finally go home. 

After a fifieen-minuie wait, the 
doctor entered with Bob's wife. 
Melissa, and took a scat next to his 
bed. 

A grave look had entered the 
doctor's face since Bob last saw 
him. and Bob could already lell that 
die news wasn't good. As Bob pre- 
pared himself for the worst, the doc- 
tor spoke. 

"Bob, I'm going to cut right to die 
chase and tell you it doesn't look too 
good for you. You show signs of 
cancer in your stomach and spinal 
area, the latter of which is causing 
your debihiation. We believe we can 
remove the cancer in your spinal 
cord, which should get rid of your 
pain for the most pan. However die 
stomach is going to be a litUe bit 
more complicated." 

"What do you mean, doctor''' 
Bob asked in fear 

"I mean it looks like you proba 
biy won't live another year. Bob 

As these words left die doctor s 
mouth, Melissa cried out and ran 
over to embrace her husband. Bob 
was so shocked he couldn't havL 
moved even if he'd wanted to His 
life had been cut shon in midstream 
The next nine months were spent 



in relative solitude by Bob. He knew 
that he had been marked by the hand 
of Death and it was only a matter of 
time until his life would make the 
transition to what lies beyond. 

Hespentas little time in the hos- 
pital as he could widi die hope of 
saving his family some money for 
what lay ahead. 

Between the two of them. Bob 
and Melissa had sat down and 
planned out all of the financial 
details sunounding Bob's prolonged 
illness and had resolved thai Bob 
wouldn't need to work as long as 
Melissa maintained her leaching job 
at the local elementary school. 

Their friends helped out as 
much as they could, but little could 
be done to cheer Bob or Meli.ssa up. 
It was as diough diey were just wail- 
ing for Bob to die. 

On sleepless nights, Melissa 
would think back to four years 
before Bob was diagnosed to die 
dream she had about Luke. 

She had written it off as just 
being a meaningless dream, but the 
chilling tone of the dream had 
stayed widi her for four years and 
she could remember every detail. 

The look on Luke's face as he 
spoke his final words to her in dial 
dream was burned Into her image 
and she did everything she could to 
gel it out of her bead. 

There it remained, however, and 
diere was nothing else she could do. 

She had the underlying feeling 
dial somehow Luke was responsi- 
ble, as litde sense as it made to 
blame someone that had been dead 
for 24 years. 

She really couldn't help it. 
though, as diat was die way she felt. 
Bob and Melissa had bodi tried to 
keep Bob's terminal illness a scltci 
from die children for as long as tht% 
could, simply telling them that Bob 
was sick and that the doctor had told 
him to take some lime off of w ork 

After a while, however it had 
become obvious to the children ihj] 
dieir fadier was sick for the last 
time. 

As Bob began to lose most of 
his mental faculties, he called m his 
boys lo speak with each of diem 
individually and explain to them 
what was going to happen and what 
should be expected of diem 

He told them all to stand tall 
just as he would, and to comfon 
their modier who would probably 
take it the hardest. 

He went on to leU diem Uiat 
their mother should always be their 
first responsibility and that he would 
always be with them waichmtover 
thi,m to the last 

He told thtm all how proud hi. 
was to bt their father and diat lhc\ 
should be just as proud lo be who 
diey are 

After he made dicm all promist 
to hve dicu- lives in the best manner 
possible Bob slipptd off to sleep 
and was transported to the hospital 
As Mdissa sat in the waiting 
room for Intensive Care with her 
boys die doetor came in and took 
her aside 

He explained to her that Boh s 
brain was incapacitated and that it 
she kept him on life support, it 
would only be prolonging the 



inevitable. He dien asked her whui 
she wanted to do in regards to her 
husband. 

Melissa had known diis moment 
would be in herfulure, but had never 
expected it to be so difficult. 

It was something Uiat she could- 
n't have planned for, she thought to 
herself but this was something dial 
needed to be decided upon. 

, With tears in hereycs, she told 
die doclor to go ahead and take him 
off of life support. 

As she entered the room for a 
final goodbye, she felt an eeriness 
creep up inside of her. 

This would be die final time she 
would see her husband relatively 
alive.As she began to cry, die doclor 
unhooked the life support that had 
been die only thing keeping Bob 
from dying. 

It was at this moment dial Bob 
spmng forth from his bed and, look- 
ing completely focused at die wall, 
cried out, "Luke? No!" and fell 
backwards as the heart monitor 
marked his death. 

It was as diough his old friend 
had finally honored dieir agreement 
to pever leave die other behind; even 
in death. 

Bob's final acdons in the world 
of the living had a resounding

AlTideO we6 sites: S:6e vDe6's eternal Mfoween 



by Vincent Garcia 



Staff Wnier 

Welcome again, all my loyal readers (csiimated at 
2.1 people, one of which is me), to die Final pan of my 
Halloween series In diis article 1 focused solely on one 
diing... getting diis article done before tomorrow's dead- 
line. 

Yet I managed to come up with some fa^inating 
sites, including an incredible pumpkin-carving contest, 
and legends of a certain Athens, Ohio, 

If Halloween has alrxjady passed by the time you get 
to look at these web sites, don't worry; most of these are 
still interesting enough to take a look ai. So here they are 
in no particular order. 

http://laclAd.ncl.pwebykeilti/kelth2.htm 



This site is inaedible to say the least. The audior of 
die site was watching "Home Improvement" one day, 
and the neighbor Wilson was carving a pumpkin. So he 
decided he warned lo try dial out. As it tums out, he has 
a unique talent for carving pumpkins. 

These pumpkins actually do look almost lifelike due 
lo a shading effect he does by diinning out the area until 
i( lets just enough light through it. Some of the portraits 
he has made on pumpkins are Edgar Allen Poe, a beagle, 
"Three Stooges" favorite Curly, and of course, die 
audior himself. 

htlp://home.nnci.net/galemi/indexJitm 

This site was created by a Halloween enthusiast. 
hence the uUe of die page '■Halloween Eternal: The Site 
Where Everyday is Halloween." So what is here? The 
site has pretty much anything having to do with 
Halloween, including Halloween music, sounds, and 



Also included is a Halloween web ring, which takes 
you to other Halloween sites on die web which have 
joined the ring. For all diose who like Halloween, this is 
probably is good as they get, and die audior has die 
awards to prove it. 

htlp://www.athenskgends.org 

The last couple of weeks, I used legend and myth- 
oriented sites to crack on. This week, I found diis site. 
So what's the difference? There's a genuine touch to diis 
one, as if the whole town of Athens was involved in 
making diis site. 

Even if the stories are totally fake, they're worth 
reading. Apparently, one of Ihe most persisting legends 
atwut the Ohio University area is one of Nicodemus, a 
rtinaway slave who was killed in a sotoriiy house (for- 
merly the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority house) during the 
Civil War. 

He is believed to come back in ghost form every 
year to haunt girls in die house What's more ironic is 
that die author cmginally listed the address as 24 E. State 
Street, bui in die "Respoases" section, one reader 
responded saying it was in fact 24 E. Washington Street. 

And just how did thLS person know that? Well, she is 
a Zeta Tau Alpha alumna. Not only does she recall the 
legend of Nicodemus but also remembers die espen- 
ence some girls had widi Nicodemus. 

TTiis marks die end of my Halloween series, I have 
no clue what 1 will write about next week, so if you have 
any suggestions e-mail dicm to me aL 
garcvbOI@holiTK;.iprw.edu. 

I don't think I will have a series on Thanksgiving 
sites; however, ]i my perfectly sane editor fX)ES want 
me to write about Thanksgiving, 1 will gladly do so at 
your e;tpcnse.

Spons Editor 

With Halloween approaching, there are a lot of 
scary faces and a lot of scared souLs out there. 

However, none of the souls are as scared a,s 
IPFW "s mens soccer opponent Missouri-S^ni 
Louis, 

The Dons drew the Rivermen in the first 
round of the Great Lakes Valley Conference 
tournament this coming week. 

UMSL. which stands 9-5-1, will host a solid 
IPFW team. 

The Dons are 10 " and come into the 
I jn opiunisuc attitude. 



The Dons will be looking for a little revenge 
against the Rivermen as they were recently 
handed their seventh loss of the season. 

Ironically, it was their seventh loss on the 
road. 

The Dons, who are 10-0 at home, have an 
unbearable 0-7 record on the road. 

Unfonunalely for the Dons, they will have lo 
play on the road throughout the tournament. 

In the team's final meeting of the season last 
Salurday. UMSL controlled the game. This 
limited the Dons lo three shots, only one of 
which was on goal. 

The Rivermen compiled eleven shoLs, eight 
of which were on goal, and two of which went 
past goalkeeper Jeff Richey. 




Forward Danny Perez blasLs a shot against an Indianapolis goalkeeper. The Dons have compiled a 6-5 conference ^^^ __^ ^_^^__ _ 
record and will hope to stir up a little magic in the conference tournament. The team will host the University of ^^^^ ^^ ^^^^. 
Missouri- Saint Louis in the first round of the GLVC loumamem. 



The Dons were outplayed, but hope lo 
improve on their weaknesses. 

The Dons will look to senior Danny Perez for 
leadership 

Perez has sct}red eight goals this season and 
knows that he will have to pby each game as if it 
were his last. 

Matt Hein and Brett Fel/ have combined lor 
13 goals this season and are two key players 
reluming next season 

Coach Tcny Slefankiewicz will need solid 
play from his defense and will need Richey to 
play tough at goal. 

This will be ihe last run at a conference title 

for Tin. Knitter. Adam Slrack and Danny Perez. 

This team will try to rally behind their 

seniors to pull off the potential 

upset. 

Knitter leads all fullbacks in 
goals scored and has been a vital 
part of this team. 

Knitter's legacy will be carried 
on by his younger brother Brian, 
who is only a sophomore this 



Slrack. also a fullback, has 
compiled three assists. 

Along with Kniticr and Perez, 
Strack has also played in all 17 
games. 

The Dons need ihat kind of 
consisiency lo advance in 
post-season play. 

However, the key to advance- 
ment of ihLs team will be the play 
of Danny Perez who has given ibc 
team 19 total points, including 
eight goals. 

This is no! only best on ihe 
team, bui is one of the best in the 
conference. 

The run at a conference title 
won't necessarily be easy for the 
Dons, 

However, the key etemcnLs of 
potent offense, stingy defense and 
good goalkeeping should keep the 
Dons in the game. 

And with the spookiest holiday 
of all coming up, hopefully the 
Dons can wake up some dead souls 
and lift them inio the dari; zone 
(crencc.
