Architectural engineering 
student Dan Sleinman had 
hoped to join a cycling club 
ivhen he first started taking 
classes at IPRV three years ago. 

Afler hunting around, 
though, Sleinman discovered 
the campus did not olfer a club 
for cyclists, 

"1 wanted to join a cycling 
group and was very surprised lo 
find that there wasn't one here." 

Sleinman decided to solve the 
problem by creating a student 
group for cycling enthusiasts. 

The group, called the Cycling 
Club oflPFW, will hold its first 
meeting tonight, al 6 p.m. in 
Classroom Medical. Room 159. 

Al Ihe meeting, the group 
will hold elections for duo offi- 
cer positions including presi-

make Ihe mosi of our campus .

around, where Ihe parents want lo get out 
ol the house because Ihe kids are driving

Ihal we had one. We had people working 
harder Ihan ever lo pull Ihis oti. 

We had a Homecoming King and 
Queen. IVilh all Ihe ellorl thai was brought 
Into this, we could have at least shown 
some appreciation (oi il. The Student 
AcHvMies Hoard (SAB), lor e.ample, 
deserves recognition for all the hard work 
they pul into Ihe lun-lillcd week. 

The students basically slapped Ihcm 
in the face by participating as little as pas-

1 am not saying Ihal you 
have lo put money into il, I 
am saying Ihat when some- 
thing comes up like 
Homecoming, you have to 
' It before you reap the 

experiences. 

Yes, [ am saying Ihat IPFW made a 
big mlslake going Division 1 and having 
Homecoming. We are a commuter school. 
We will never l&gt;e anything more than thai. 

For eiample, look how wc could have 
lit everyone who was in the War Memorial 
Coliseum into the Milliard Gales Sports 
Center, It would have been a tight fit, but 
it would have made for a more eiciting 
game. 

It would have been much better for 
our school lo get its first dose ol recogni- 
tion in a filled -I o-capacily Gates Center 
Ihan in Ihe less-than-packed Coliseum, [t 
is more embarrassing lo show up lo a 
game thai was well-publicized and see the 
turnout woi^e than expected.

If you think 
that a dormitory

this place, your 
Ihinting is absurd. 
The dorms will 
only provide an 
easier accommodation for oul-of- 1 owners 
and athletes. That will merely result in a 
slight increase in enrollmenl. 

The projecled 550 people ivho will be

patnolism is nothing new lor Ihe older citizens ol 
this nation. For them, patriotism is something 
that has always been Inerc. For the rest of us. it is 
something new and powerful that carmol be 

Flags are on everything from houses to cars 
and it doesn'l slop with the average citizen, 
[oumalisis also feel Ihe pressure of the nation's 
display of patriotism. Individual patriotism is fine 
and even cornmendable, but journalists are left 
with an awesome responsibility lo Ihe American 

They must always try lo distribute news that is 
free from outside influence. This meoru Ihal the 
newfrmedia must find a way to balance their pro- 
fessionalism with the current sense of patriotism 
il they are lo supply the public with information 
that is both thorough and accurate. 

Currently, the media doesn't seem lo be domg 
a very good job ol this. Recent patriotism in Ihe 
news media has alfecled Ihe type and amount of 
information given to Ihe American people. 

The lirst, and perhaps most obvious, cflecl is 
the current relationship between Ihe government 
and the news media. So much for the govcm- 
mcnt-walchful and wary media thai we became 
accustomed lo during the Clinton administration. 

Since Sept. II, news networks have displayed 
an abundance of understanding and cooperation 
with President Bush and his ollicials. 

When the news networks and newspapers 
were asked by National Security Advisor 
Condoleeza Rice not lo air live broadc.ists of or 
publish unedited correspondence from bin Laden, 
they agreed. 

The cause of Ihe request was one of national 
security. The government is afraid thai there 
could be hidden mcss.iges in bin Ladin's corre- 



spondence and that Ihese encoded messages 
could trigger another attack. However, one only 
needs internet access to view the messages in 

If bin Laden really wanted to get information 
to someone, couldn I he just post on the internet, 
pick up a phone or send a fax? Lcl'sbe realistic. 
Also, what does this say about our govemmenl's 
faith in the American people? 

The American public is nol lond ol bin Ladin. 
His ideas and messages will not brainwash us; 
they simply will provide us with a different per- 
spective and more information, wilh which we 
can better understand this wan 

Patriotism is also affecting the neutrality and 
walchlulness of Ihe media by putting pressure on 
journalists to seem palriolic. 

According to (Cen Paulson from Gannet News 
Service, "journalists who raised questions about 
Ihe presioenl's early handling ol the crisis have 
been inundated wilh furious phone calls, calling 
Ihem a disgrace to their profession and even trai- 

With such pressure from withm their oivn pro- 
fession, the news media are in danger of losing 
their freedoms and objectivity We need Ihe media 
lo remain Ircc from outside influence. The role of 
Ihe American news media as the overseer of Ihe 
American government is cssenlial to the liveli- 
hood ol our other rights and freedoms. 

Finally, the current patriotic sentiment is allow- 
ing Ihe news media lo revert back to old methods 
of wartime |oumalism. The media has always 
been led by the government in times ol war and, 
lo a certain extent. Ihe molivations are justified. 

Reasons of national security require that cer- 
tain information not be given to Ihe public. 
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once 



said, "in wartime, Irijih is so precious thai she 
should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies." 

However, past experience has shown the 
American news media thai waHimc news regula- 
tioi\s can be dangerous lo their validity and rcpu- 

The most rcceni example is Ihal ol Ihe Gull 
War of 1991. Here the independence ol the news 
media was overcome by a military csiablishment 
that spoon-fed journalists information lo give to 
Ihe American people. 

My favorite example is one providc'd by Waller 
nkitc during Ihe vieln ' ' 



i\\U the line, "And 

Er, il was laterdlscov-

The news media musl remember these exam- 
ples and remain watchful ol the government, 
especially at a time in history when we need to 
display lor our enemies the freedoms and ideals 
upon which our nation was founded, 

I am an American, You are probably an 
American. We a J must be sure to uphold the very 
freedoms for which we arc lighting. The news 
media must do the same. 

Individual patriotism is fine — even for journal-

I thought It would I 
simple underiaking. I : 

thought I would be able to : 

jot down the many recur- 
ring ideas and opinions circling in 
my head about the terrorist attacks 
and our nation's subsequent relalia- 
tions, but it hasn't been so simple. 

The thing is. my thoughts and 
opiiuons on the pervasive subject 
have changed. Like most Amencaru, 
I was devastated when I ivoke up 
thai morning and saw those build- 
ings engulfed in flames and later 

crumbling down like, well, like giant that's disputabli 
buildings do when their insides an i i .. 

burned up and can no longer sup- 
port their otvn enormous mass. 

I was sickened by what I saw. The would simply 
images and the impact on my psy- graphs c 
che made me want to stay in bed. I of this "■ 
was stricken with an apathy that did 
not clear for tivo or three days after-

tike so many m the media were 
immediately doing as the events 
unfolded. Iliey'd already had a face 
and a name for the guilty party. I 
Iried lo view the events skeptically, 
as an unbiased witness,

aspect of it. 
Laying 
blame is always tricky, II

guilty party is. It seerns

Ihe history of modem terrorism — 
at does anything more than ~link"

Certainly he hiis a role. I don'l Ihink 

ike this a cru- 

againsl this man. Thai's not 

what I intended lo do. 1 thought 1 

ssues and aspects 

think one can do so without at least 
recognising that bin Laden is the fig- 
ure who looms largest in the land- 
scape of these events. 

He Ls the new poster boy for ter- 
rorism. He is. as far as the media 
and Ihe eovemment seem to be con- 
cerned, the person behind these 
attacks. I Ihuik he is a highly intelli- 
gent individual. I also view him as a 
man of numerous contradictions. 

AScEdid a biographvof him thai 
recently aired. One of the points the 



least when he was a young man, 
absorbed Western culture. The show 
claimed he frequented night clubs 
and drank and parlied much like, 
well, many college students do. 

Then something happened and he 
repelled Western culture. 

There doesn't seem to be a defini- 
tive ai\swer as to where this man's 
hatred of America comes from. 
Much has been made of his experi- 
ences in Afghanistan's war with 
Russia in the laie 1970s. Much has 
been made of his spite for the wesl- 
emizalion of Islamic-dominated 
countries. Much has been made of 
his hatred for America (read the infi- 
del) having a foothold in Ihe Islamic 
holy land, Saudi Arabia I think 
these are all decent and solid and 
reasons behind this man's behavior. 

How strong and compelling they 
are for him is difficult lo say. 
Certainly they play a large role. I 
thmk there is more to his motiva- 
tions Ihal have yet to come to li^l. 

There is an attitude now in this 
country of wishing for bin Laden's 
death. I don'l think his death will 
ameliorate the situation. 1 don't 
think there is a short and simple 
answer to ending leriorism. It would 
be simple enough to ask. "Why 
doesn'l America simply leave 
Islamic countries?" Alter all, that is 
what the terrorists wanl, isn't il? 
They want to oust the infidel. 

Maybe that's what wc should do. 
Mavbe we should just close shop 
and come home. We have the 

leans lo fmd altema- 
'. After all, Ihat is 



why America insists on staking a 
claim in the Middle East. 

1 think it's imoossible for America 
to leave now. I think doing so would 
cause an enormous Icldown of 
morale in Ihis country. There are far 
too many Americans who are 
depending on some soti of 
vengeance or compcnsalion lor what 
happened in September. A good por- 
tion of them are running Ihis coun- 
try. An about-face now might solve 
the situation in terms ol decreasing 
terrorist attacks an American inler- 
csls, but I don't think it's very plau- 
sible or realistic. 

I am inclined, however, lo wish 
America would do (list Ihat. I 
believe Ihal ilsomeone hales me 
enough lo want to kill mc — and to 
be willing to do so — when J sel foot 
in his or her country, then I'm going 
to slay out of it. 

1 don'l think oil is worth dying 
for. 1 think the easiest way lo end 
1 is lo pull out of our inler- 
I Ihe Middle East. America is

Students looking to (or tutorship al

Support and Advancement, and transitioning slu-

"Our goal is lo help people Iraruition from

their functioru and will offer assistance lo stu- 
dents who would tike to take advantage ol the

Ihe class concerning iLs content, SI uses social 
inleraclion to make concepts learned in Ihe class- 
room more meaningful by allowing each group 
member discuss their understanding of classroom 
theory, 

Anderson said that he notices students come 
back 10 CA6A lor their services because they have 
worked so well, but he said he hopes the services 
will help make Ihe student a stronger independent 
learner 

"We're always happy lo have students come 
back beyuse Ihal sav's we have helped them a lot. 
And, we are always liappy when we can hear slu- 
denls say, 'hey, I learned a lol by being lulored or 
through Supplemental Instruction.' It jusi 
depends on how much Ihe students want to team 
the material." Anderson said. 

Many of the sludenls that use CASA are A 
students, and students who know how to use the 
seri'ices lo keep their eood grades. 

Anderson said, "We wish all sludenls would 
use CASA, so that all students could become bel- 
ter students. I want Ihe A students, Ihc B students, 
the C sludenls, and the students who maybe aren't 
doing so well to utilize us because it is great fun to 
see students learning." 

tn Ihe future, CASA hopes lo maintain the 
number ol tutors and St classes and find ways lo 
make the program larger By doing this Anderson 
said he believes the quality of help they give stu- 
dents will be increased and more sludenls will uti-

Anderson said he hopes the space used by

Key players lo walch: Kyle Homsby and 
Jared Odie. Hornsby will be crucial to Ihe 
success of Indiana this year. He needs lo hit 
the outside shots in order lo keep Jeffries 
from being double-teamed, 

OdIe is key as well. Wilh Jeff Newton 
out for the season with a fractured check

lineup. Starling, he could average 12-15 
points per game, making up lor some of

would look for Ihciti lo make some noise in

The Boilermakers are tomuig oil ol a 
17-1.1 record last .season. They ended up in 
Ihe National Invitation Tournament and 
placed in Ihc final eight for pusl-season 

Purdue is coached by Ihe Oamboyanl 
personality of Gene Kcady, Keady is in his 

twenlv-sccond year wilh an overall record 
of 45^206 Keady's ability to bring a group 
of players and turn them into Big Ten bas- 
ketball champions may be somewhat under- 

As far as Purdue's lalenl goes this sea- 
son, Ihe polenlial is there. Top returnees for 
Ihc Boilermakers include a strong group of 
seniors and underclassmen. 

John Allison, a 6'10" senior al center. Is 



rebounds per game. He was leading the Big 
Ten in blocks last season, as well. Me was 
able lo put up double digit numbers in more 

Rodney Smilh, a 6'6" senior fortvanJ, is 
coming off of a broken fool. Smilh aver- 
aged 13.9 points and 4,S rebounds per ^unc 
and could possibly have a career year this 
season. He could be Ihe big scorer for Ihe 
Boilers. 

Senior loe Marshall, a 6'2" guard, 
played well for the Big Ten Summer Tour 
Team, He averaged 12 poinls. 4,2 assists, 
and 3.7 rebounds, Marshall brings a defen- 
sive and physical presence for the Boilers. 

Another senior guard, 6'1" Maynard 
Lewis, will add experience and depth lo the 
backcourl. He averaged nearly 10 poinls per 
game last season. 

Junior Willie Deanc (6'1"1 and sopho- 
more Auslin Parkinson (6'0"} will also add 
valuable minutes lo Ihe backcourl. Deanc is 
a nice mid-range player and Parkinson is a 
sinsng passer. 

Newcomers and incoming freshman 
will pul pressure on Ihc vclerans lo play 
well this season. 

Junior College transfer Darmelreis 
Kilgore will bring much needed alhlcllcism 
lo the Purdue leam. He can rebound and 
shoot beyond the arc. Kilgore averaged an 
impressive 23 poinls per game l.isi season. 

Mall Carroll, a 6'8" Ircshman forward, 
will bring some intensity and weight lo Ihe 
Purdue wing position. 

The most talented newcomer Ihis sea- 
son may be the Mr. Indiana Baskelball run- 
ner-up from South Bend LaSalle High 
School, 6'2" guard Brandon McNight. He 
averaged 2S poinls and cighl assists per 
game during his final prep year. 

Currently, Purdue is not ranked in the 
national lop 25 poll, bul hopes lo move 
within the lop 20 by the end of Ihe season. 
The Big Ten is lough this year, Purdue may 
find it dilficull to sec a seed in Ihc NCAA 
Tournament. Look for them to place in the 
middle ol the Big Ten standings and possi- 
bly make anolher NIT showing. 

Bul who knows, perhaps Keady can 
work another miracle Big Ten Championship. 

However, he might meet sc — " 

with Michigan Slate, tllinc 
Indiana in Ihe way.

Creating a personoli 



the LINE on the brink of falling off 



By Ryan Middieion. SlafI 
Writer 

It is 3 rare occasion that 
everyone in the band sings, 
or so I thought unM I heard 
this CD. A punk rock group 
that is desperately trying lo 
get recognized should proba- 
bly either change what they 
are doing, or just stop all 
together. 

The group "the LINE" has 
been around for some time. 
They were grouped logelher 
in '94 after linishing high 
school However, Ihey were 
not complete until Ihey later 
added drummer Mike 
Thompson m 2000. 

The Line has changed a 
great deal wilh each CD Ihey 
have released. The aggres- 
sive/progressive rock and roll 
group IS preparing to release 
another CD shortly called 
"Monslers We Breed." 

I am the type of person 
who is open to ideas ol all 
sorts when it comes to music. 
I am usually accepting ol any 
type of music or genre. I have 
listened to Ihis CD many 
times now and I am on the 
verge of either throwing it or 
myself oul of the window. I 
now realize why they have 
put out CD after CD and have 
yet to get a response. 

What are Ihey Irying to 
do, make a genre by them- 
selves? II they are, I will save 
them the time and name the 
genre myself: terrible, never 
progressive rock and roll. I 
found playing wilh the 
Windows Media Player and 
the headphon9s more enjoy- 



able than listening lo this 
music. 

I know that Ihis band had 
claimed Ihey were slaying 
Irue lo their roots of punk 
rock. 1 am assuming, after lis- 
tening to the CO, thai they 
had individual roots. They 
sure played like il. One want- 
ed punk, the other wanted 
heavy metal, another was 
just playing whatever he 
could and Ihe singer was talk- 
ing wilh accented, elongaled 
words. 

I am tolally open to punk 
rock music. This group, which 
I slated earlier, had said Ihal 
their roots lean towards punk. 
I think that they should go 
back to their heritage and 
take a crash course in punk 
rock music. They say thai an 
apple doesn't fall far hom Ihe 
tree, but Ihis apple (ell and 
rolled down Ihe hill to a horse 
who ate it. 

This is exactly what 
should be done to this band, 
but I would not recommend it 
because you would only feel 
Ihe urge to regurgitate. Yes, 
Ihey really are that bad. 

I didn'l know whether or 
not I should feel sorry tor 
them or feel the exact oppo- 
site. They are trying really 
hard to break into the music 
industry, which can be 
extremely tough. They have 
toured with some well-known 
bands, such as Sublime and 
Less than Jake. 

I then came to the real- 
ization Ihat maybe il is not 
sympathy thai they need. 
Maybe it is Ihe hard, cold 
truih It is possible that Ihey 



just need someone to tell 
Ihem thai they are bad and 
Ihe option of quilting would 
only lessen the chance of 
embarrassment 

A band is made ol talent- 
ed individuals who come 
together and combine the tal- 
ents lhai each possesses. 
However, the talents need lo 
be ot similar interests. 

Ttie band mel this criteri- 
on until It came lo the lead 
singer Then they must have 
gone lo some random guy, 
noticed he coutd bell oul a 
tune and chose him for Ihe 
lead singer. They apparently 
did nol bother lo determine 
belotehand whether or nol 
Ihe man could actually sing. 
Nor did they ligure oul Ihat 
this same man sounds like he 
IS lone deaf. 

You may be saying to 
yourself. This guy is really 
hard on this band. He is real- 
ly negative towards this 
band." I am only negative to 
those who are negative 
toward me. This CD was 
extremely negative lo me, 

I did, however, gel some- 
thing out of Ihis CD— I have 
furthered my repertoire wilh a 
new genre of music. I now 
have a more insightlul look 
into music Ihat is, in my opin- 
ion, complete garbage. 

I would only recommend 
this CD if you were going 
away (or the' weekend and 
did not have a watchdog. It is 
very likely thai this music will 
keep everyone away from 
your house.
