INDIANA - PURDUE COMMUNICATOR 



INDIANA-PURDUE UNIVERSITY. FOKT WAYNE, INDIANA 



This time by students 



Another steering 
committee formed 



By MARK FRANKE 

The Student Senate last night 
created a third campus steering 
committee to study the upcoming 
merger of Indiana-Purdue. The 
committee, which will be composed 
mostly of students, will study 
unification independently of the 
present steering committees of fa- 
culty and staff. 

The committe, which will be called 
the Ad Hoc Student Steering and 
Advisory Committee, was created by 
unanimous vote, but only after a long 
debate on its structure and function. 

Tom Johnson, Senate sponsor of the 
committee, said that the AHSSAC was 
intended to "get the ball rolling" 
toward involving students in the 



i -i-i i authorized 
by Ralph Broyles, chancellor of I,U. 
here, and Purdue Dean RogerManges 
to report directly to the new 
super-chancellor. Until such time as 
the super-chancellor takes office, the 
AHSSAC will report to Broyles and 
Manges, the committee was struc- 
tured to allow for a broad represen 
ration oflU-PU student body. The 
initial eight members were elected by 
the Senate. These eight are to elect 
other members as they see fit. 

Elected from the Senate were 
Johnson, Rollie Clements, Charles 
Pratt, Barry LaBov, Terri Forte, 
Greg Lewark, Tracy White, and 
Karen Lanev. 

The eight then elected Felix 
Rieger. Dennis Jackson, Paul Green, 
Obie Booker, and Pat Teegarden to 
serve on the AHSSAC. 

"I don't want to exclude anyone just 
because they didn't get elected with 
some political party or somehow got 
into student government," said John- 
son. He said that the committee 
should represent as broad a scope as 
possible. 

The AHSSAC will accept nomina- 
tions for additional members at 
future meetings. 

Many of those present at the Senate 
meeting expressed confusion an to the 
purpose of the committee. Paul 
Green an observor at the meeting, 
said that he saw a "mass of 
confusion" with three separate steer- 
ing committees in operation. 

Larry Strong, a former student 
senator, saw friction developing 
between the students and the faculty 
and administration. "I see no way in 
the name of Peter that this will 



establish good relations," said 

The AHSSACwas assigned the task 
of appointing the student representa- 
tives to the task forces of the faculty 
steering committee. This was done to 
improve the flow of communication 
from the faculty committee back to 
the students. 

The issue of student power in the 
university governance system was a 
topic of discussion on the Senate floor 
as it had been at the faculty steering 
committee last week. 

* 'Students have never had too much 
power out here," said Green, who had 
acted as student spokesman in the 
previous meeting also. 

Strong warned that the Senate must 
be careful of the things that had 
bogged down student governments in 
the past. 

Johnson was optimistic as to the 
role students would play in the 
unification process. "They (fa- 
culty) probably aren't afraid of giving 
up some of the power of suggestion 
they have," he said. He commented 
that last week's meeting of the faculty 



student committee members. 

Johnson was later elected chairman 
of the student steering committee. 

In other business, Green presented 
a list of grievances. One grievance 
centered on the student power issue. 
He complained that student input into 
campus policy decisions was "almost 
nil." 



reason for this feeling is IU-PU's 
status as a regional campus. "No one 
here has very much power," he said. 
"Power has come from the main 
campuses, a little at a time. 

"Even with the super-chancellor 
we're going to be no better off unless 
the parent campuses divest them- 
selves of that power." 

Another old IU-PU issue, paid 
parking, was the subject of a second 
grievance. Green criticized the 
Senate for not working toward the 
elimination of paid parking. 

"I see paid parking as something 
that has no need or use here, ' ' he said. 
He stated that the money accumu- 
lated from parking fees appears to 
do no good, judging trom me conuiuon 
of the lots. 

He urged the complete elimination 
of the fee, and proposed that the 
senate adopt a resolution to that

Green also criticized the prices 
charged by the cafeteria, bookstore, 
and child care center. He said that 
moat students he has talked to 
consider the bookstore "more or less 
a rip-off." 

He proposed that the university 
administration take charge of the 
cafeteria because it could run the 
service more economically. He 
suggested that child care shoul be 
free of charge. 

Ulmer said that a no charge child 
care center could only provide cheap 
baby-sitting. "You just cannot run on 
a voluntary and practicum basis an 
educational quality type of exper- 
ience," responded the dean, to the 
suggestion that a non-professional 
staff be used to cut cost. 

Green also criticized the recrea- 
tional facilities on campus. Citing the 
fact that the Student Union was built 
with student fees and that money was 
allocated from the activity fund to 
staff the recreational rooms in the 
building, Green said, "No one can tell 
me that we need $1.25 per hour to 
maintain the pool room." 

Green also said that a non-partisan

Senate hopeful Lugar stumps IU-PU 



By MARK FRANKE 

Indianapolis Mayor Richard 
Lugar reiterated his opposition to 
busing yesterday as the Republican 
Senate hopeful brought his campaign 
to Indiana-Purdue. 

"Busing is not an acceptable means 
of desegregating schools," said Lugar 

Communicator 

Lugar, who hopes to unseat present 
Senator Birch Bayh, spoke out 
against the court-ordered desegrega- 
tion plan that buses black Indianapo- 
lis school children into the outlying 
county school districts. 

Lugar called the plan "ludicrous." 
He said that the court's plan would 
force the closing of three Indianapolis 
high schools and 25 elementary 
schools. 

The Indianapobs mayor said that 
the plan woul lead to the "debilita- 
tion" of the city's school system. 

Lugar called for voluntary eforts to 
achieve racial integration in the city's 
schools. Forced busing is usually 
self-defeating, the mayor said. 

Lugar cited a former Indianapolis 
experiment in which students were 
given a choice of high schools to 

Teachers speech 
and hearing 
to be tested 

All interested students who need 
speech and hearing tests for student 
teaching assignments will be tested

evening appointments have been 
arranged. Appointment schedules are

attend. he said that if the schools 
can offer desirable choices to the 
students, a great deal more racial 
integration will result. 

Lugar, who was a member of the 
Indianapolis school board prior to 
becoming mayor, said many people 
consider forced busing as a last 
weapon to use when the others fail. 
He said, "We must end it as a last 
weapon." 

The Indianapolis mayor said he has 
been opposed to forced busing for the 
last ten years. 

Mayor Lugar said that he has been 
pleased with the progress of Indiana 



school for achieving in the last five 
years much more than he thought 
woul be accomplished in that time. 

In 1968 Lugar said that complete 
independence was the "manifest 
destiny" of what was the conglomer- 
ate of campuses and programs, "the 
mark of a great city is a great 
university. 

"I still feel that way," he said. 

The mayor is pleased with the 
quality of what is being put together 
for Indianapolis students at IU-PUI. 



and graduate schools. 

He said that the problem of name, 
whether to caU the campus IU-PUI or 
the University of Indianapolis, is one 
that will be worked out in due course. 

The Senatorial hopeful called for 
student loans to be made available to 
students on the basis of both need and 
convenience. President Nixon's 
budget proposes to limit loans to 
those students who can demonstrate a 
definite financial need for funds. 

Lugar said that low income 
students should be assisted, He 
emphasized vocational training . 



Lugar said that he would support 
the school prayer amendment pre- 
sently pending in Congress. The 
amendment would allow prayers to be 
said in the public schools. 

He was not sure about supporting 
the right-to-life amendment, a mea- 
sure that prohibits abortion. He 
indicated that his personal position in 
the abortion controversy is not to 

He said that he would support a 
proposal similiar to the one offered by 
Governor Otis Bowen, a proposal that 
woul legalize abortion under strict 
medical conditions. 

Lugar said that one must keep in 
mind the health of the mother, the 
mal-practices experienced under 
illegal abortions, and the sexual 
promiscuity of society. 

Lugar said that he was listening 



both sides of In? controversy. 

The Indianapolis mayor called his 
city's so-called uni-gov a very 
important break-through. Uni-gov 
has given Indianapolis a strong 
competitive edge on jobs and invest- 
ment and political clout with Wash- 
ington, according to Lugar. 

Uni-gov unites most city and county 
jurisdictions under one government in 
Marion County. 

Lugar said that services have been 
increased while the property tax rate 
for all Marion County residents has 
gone down. He said that people pay 
only for the services that they 

He said that although uni-gov was 
tailored to the Indianapolils situation, 
the principles of county reform can be 
applied anywhere. 



Helmke: merger not affected 
by legislative deletion 



s-Purdue from the state 
budgetr bill will have no effect on the 
impending merger of the two institu- 
tions at the Fort Wayne Campus, 
according to State Senator Walter 
Helmke. 

"It does not in any way deter the 
unification of I. U. -Purdue on this 
campus," said Helmke.

no legal effect, he said. 



language to be in a budget bill." The 
budget bull usually consists of line 
entries allocating money to specific 
state operations. 

Helmke denied that the clause was 
deleted because of opposition from 
legislators from Indianapolis, South 
Bend and Evansville. The represen- 
tatives of these areas were reportedly 
upset because the Fort Wayne 
delegation did not support bills 
creating independent universities 
from regional campuses existing in 

Helmke said that he would have 
liked to see the clause remain in the 
bill, but he said that unification would 
not be affected because IU-PU 
already has the apparatus to merge.

THE MAGIC MIRROR 



Fooling around with liberty 



New activity policy 

The Communicator is back in business. Last Monday Purdue agreed 
to immediately pay its bill to this newspaper. 

Newspapers are supposed to uncover the un justices of a community, 
but it is usually done through investigative reporting and crusading 
editorializing. It is not standard operating procedure for a newspaper to 
become a victim of the wrong in order to right it. But that is what the 
Communicator was forced to do in this situation, 

We were successful in forcing payment only by threatening to take 
the whole ugly mess to the Fort Wayne community via a press 
conference. No amount of logic or pressure could get the job done. Not 
until we threatened to tarnish the images of the great image seekers did 
we get results. 

If the Communicator's experience does anything, we hope it will 
demonstrate that the Purdue activity policy is a carpet-bagging one. This 
policy was written in Lafayette and enforced at Lafayette's discretion. 

The policy does not take into account that this is a commuter campus, 
that this is a joint I.U. and Purdue campus, and that this is not Lafayette. 
And it certainly does not care (hat sludcn' activity fee is collected for the 
benefit of the IU-PU student body. 

What all this means is that IU-PU needs its own distinct activity 
policy. This policy will need lo include some of the Purdue policy, some of 
the I.U. policy, and some things that are neither. One does not need to 
speculate about the magnitude of opposition thai this idea can expect in 
Lafayette. 

The Student Senate is upset in a positive manner. It could easily be 
the big loser in this mess. The Cointminii;ilm- finally got its money, but 
the Senate was emasculated in the process. A legal appropriation of the 
Senate was lied up by the Purdue administration for nearly three months 
for no legal reason, 

The Senate appears to be taking steps thai Ihis does not happen 
again. That body can be well advised to inform the IU-PU unification 
negotiators of its dislike of the Purdue policy. This newspaper urges the 
Senate to join us in calling for a distinct IU-PU activity policy. 

FOOTNOTES: A CONGRESSIONAL REPORT 



By JERRY t. MILLER 

Are you ready for a short quiz? 

All right, who threw the most 
famous tea party of all time? If you 
answered the Mad Halter give 
yourself half credit. Every school boy 
will tell you it was The Sons of 
Liberty. Liberty! Ah yes, liberty! 

Liberty, as you know, is a word 
many people have become attached to 
during mankind's stay on this planet 
Consider Patrick Henry's famous 
"Give me liberty or give me death!." 
Consider that friendly old woman 
standing in the waters outside New 
York City. You know, The Statue of 
Liberty. Consider, consider. Consider 

A most powerful word, liberty. 
But what does it mean? We've been 
encouraged to exercise it, exhorted to 
defend it, and warned against abusing 
it. In times of mora] conflict, saints 
and martyrs have claimed to have 
more liberty while imprisoned than 
that possessed by fellow citizens on 
the outside. Words like conscience, 
responsibility and truth have been 
invoked. 

However, prisons are generally 
considered instruments of restriction. 
Liberty, we must believe, has to do 
with man and his possible courses of 
action. What can man do? What can 
man be? 

"Liberation," a modern rendition 
of an old tune, is making the charts 
today wherever the pipers are piping : 
Gay Liberation, Women's Liberation, 
Symbionese Liberation Army, etc. 
Drums keep pounding rhythms in my 
brain, and the beat goes on. But the 
thunder is yet to roar! 

God has something to say about 



the times we live in. Listen carefully 
to this grand old march, "Where the 
Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." 
(1 Corinthians 3:17). 

Christianity, you must realize, is 
much more than a nice set of 
principles or a good philosophy, the 
Christian life is a living experience 
with the living God. It is freedom 
from the power and consequences of 

Sin? Are you calling people 

Actually, what I'm doing is telling 



it like it is, like the Bible s 
you're going to fool around with 
concepts like liberty, then you need to 
know what's keeping you in bondage. 



e Bible declares that each man 
has sinned and fallen short of the 
glory of God. "There is none 
righteous, no not one." (Romans 3:10) 
You, me, President Nixon, Billy 
Graham, and your mother all have 
one thing in common. We're unright- 
eous! All deserve God's judgment. 
But there is good ri 



forgn 



In Christ there is 
giveness. 
I'm talking about 



more than just a Sunday School thing. 
Being a Christian means knowing that 
your sins are forgiven, knowing that 
the Spirit of God dwells within you, 
and knowing for a certainty that 
you're going to Heaven. If you don't 
know these things, then you're not a 
Christian. "But if the Spirit of Him 
that raised up Jesus from the dead 
dwell in you, he that raised Christ 
from the dead shall also quicken 
(make alive) your mortal bodies by 
his Spirit that dwelleth in you." 
(Romans 8:11) 

"But what must I do to gain all 
this?" you ask. The answer is so 
simple that we mess it up with our 
complex thinking apparati. Heaven is 
a free gift to all who accept it in faith. 
There is nothing anyone can do to 

There is only one way you can 
become a Christian. You must 
approach God in prayer with the 
realization that you have nothing to 
offer Him. Seek the forgiveness of 
Christ, and then accept it in faith. The 
moment you have accepted Christ's 
forgiveness you become a Christian. 
You then possess a new nature and a 



new power. You have the power to 
rule over your own selfishness, power 
to discern good and evil, and power to 
stand victorious in the face of 
adversity and opposition. You also 
have the promise of eternal life. 

I challenge each and every person 
reading this article to approach 
Christ in faith. "Ask and you shall 
receive. Seek and you shall find." 
(Matthew 7:7)

Innocent life destroyed to solve social problem 



By FRANCES SCHROEDL 

A woman facing an unwanted 
pregnancy is often fearful of her 
ability lo cope with her situation. 
Society today further confuses her 
dilemma by offering her the choice of 
a legal abortion. 

Under the guise of a solution to 
her problems, abortion forces the 
woman to reject Ihe truly feminine

attribute of choosing humane and 
nonviolent alternatives which are 
more lasting solutions. 

The feminist movement, in its 
attempt to make women more aware 
of themselves as persons, is asking 



oppressing another group of persons, 
their own unborn. Can we rationalize 
this by denying the personhood or 
humanity of the unborn? 

Humanity can no longer be 
defined in terms of viability or when 
the child can live outside the mother's 
womb. Viability doesn't measure the 
baby It measures the sophistication 
of the external life-support systems

infant that doctors were limited to

Should abortion be made illegal? 



Pregnancy from rape is an 
almost negligible percentage of the 
number of women attacked. 

A 10-year study of the University 
of Minnesota of 3,500 cases of rape 
treated in hospitals within 72 hours of 
the attack revealed zero cases of 
pregnancy. Couldn't it just be possible 
that by crying abortion for the victims 
of rape, we might literally be ignoring 
the real problems of rape victims? (In 
any case, does abortion in robbing the 
unborn child of life, heal or compound 
the wounds of the rape victim?) 

Of the estimated 600,000 legal 
abortions in 1972, the vast majority 
were performed to solve the social 




Women must bear brunt of male-female mistakes 



By WILLARD JOHNSON 

There are more than a dozen 

religious groups with many millions 
of adherents who have decided by due 
process that abortion may be upheld 
in the eyes of their churches as being 



On the other hand there

chairman of Zero Popula- 
tion Growth. 





several religious groups to whom 
abortion is anathema. These also 
have millions of members. 

If the state were to interfere in 
this religious controversy, it would be 
taking a stand against one group or 



the other, in this case against those 
who believe, in conscience, that 
abortion is permissible. 

Even if the promoters of the 
amendment were to secure its 
passage, there still would be millions 
of Americans whose beliefs then 
would be coerced by the state. That is 
contrary to American law and 
tradition, to separation of church and 
state and contrary to the anticoercion 
stand of the Ecumenical Council, 

Such a decision would certainly 
be legal compulsion in a question that 
is essentially moral. 

The public beliefs about abortion 
were clearly stated in several polls, 
including the Gallup poll of August 25, 
1972. before the Supreme Court 



cent had no opinion. 

In all 22 categories of the 
population, there was more than 
majority consensus. Even Roman 
Catholics were 56 per cent for this 
right to choose. And only 39 per cent 
opposed. 

Another serious question is 
whether any new law against abortion 
could be enforced. The polls show 
two-thirds of the American people in 
favor of the court decision Many 
millions have their consciences sup- 
ported by their churches, so there 
would be for many millions of 

between the law and their own beliefs 
and religious consciences. 

This was the essence of the failure 
of Prohibition; people did not believe 



It is now apparent that the same 
situation would prevail about abortion 
and hence the law could not be 
enforced. 

Furthermore, the new abortion 
techniques, endometrial aspiration 
and prostaglandins, now being used 
widely in the United States and other 
parts of the world are so simple that it 
is quite possible that millions of 
women might be trying their own 
techniques ... to their own harm. 

We would again have the horrible 
situation which prevailed before 
abortion became legal with the rich 
always getting an abortion and the 
poor dying of butchery abortions. 
There would again be vast numbers of 
dead babies and mothers because the 
law forced them into illegal medical

women bear the brunt of the burden.

believe that questions about women's 
rights and life-styles will be settled

So the argument r 

That, of course, is one of the facts

II \&lt; K I OR AN ENCORE - 

But we didn't know that last Friday, when a glum little 
group assembled in the Indiana-Purdue Communicator 
office. Newspapers have ceased publication before; there 
was the Washington Daily News m July. 1372. and that slain 
and special giant the New York Herald Tribune in 1966 The 
big ones and the little ones come and go, but about "your" 
paper no journalist can be objective. 

Whenever they go, papers, like ships, sink gallantly 
Our typesetter, Dolores Sanford, had baked and brought a 
special chocolate cake concoction thickly iced and adorned 



Tommy Franke the bad news. "I didn't want to tell you, but 
when I cut the cake that heart in the center stared right at 
me saying, "So Long!' " 

ALL PSYCHED OUT 

Psychology 111 under Dr. Kenneth Kassover this 
semester has developed a certain aura all its own. Look at 
the bulletin board, for example. Title suggestions for 
symposiums re pinned there expectantly awaiting signets. 
One was strongly headed, "Reactions to B F. Skinner." A 
class member deleted the "to" and substituted "are." 

Craig Martin is enrolled in this class. It is worth coming 
early to learn the latest Martin flight of fancy. There was 
the day when Craig strode in determinedly and faced two 
feminine class members. "I've got a question to ask you..." 
He launched, and then skidded to a confused stop. "No, I 
can't ask you!" After sufficient persuasion, Craif; admitted 
that he really couldn't expect a feminine reaction as to 
whether it always itched so much when you started to grow 
a beard. But kind hearted as he is, Craig gave the girls a 
chance to question answer. Girls should know about 
fashions; so he modeled his new jacket. The problem was, 
according to muddled Martin, that it looked large but felt 
small. It had, however, been a great bargain. Craig came to 
a fitting decision, just as class began, to wear it hanging 
open. Come early for the Martin matinee. 

SALUTE TO A SGT. (A MINIVIEW) 

Hey fellows! those of you who think there is an Air 
Force recruiting sergeant on permanent duty here on 
campus, relax. That's TSgt. Hector Navedo, and he's on 
book duty. When not browsing on campus, Hector serves 
actively as the technical advisor for the local Air National 
Guard Unit. 

An active member of the U.S. Air Force for the past 
eighteen years, TSgt. Navedo has three years to go until his 
retirement from the service. Hector was born in Cagus, 
Puerto Rico, and enlisted there fresh from time spent at the 
University of Puerto Rico. It was a big decision, a 
"shocking process" when Hector decided to finish his 
degree after an eighteen year hiatus. At first the Sgt. was 
"fighting the books," but as he says with real gratitude, "a 
great bunch of guys and girls and the i 
helped me make it." 



something that will go away. In 1960, Vance Packard v&gt; 
a best seller, The Waste Makers, stating there would be a 
fuel shortage in thirteen years. He didn't mention the 
month, but that was close enough. The millions who read his 
book assumed it would all go away too, or Congress would 
do something, or it wouldn't happen here. Now Barry 
Commoner tells us that we have about twenty years of 
breathable air left. You still don't worry. 

Some ecological events involving people on the IU-PU 
campus might help convince you ecology is you. Dr. Jacque 
Snyder tells of a fellow, (er, pardon please), another 
anthropologist whose carbon dating of a skull he found 
came out 1990. We haven't even reached 1984, have we? 
Remember hearing about radioactive fall out; it didn't 
really go away. Then Dr. Joseph Gardner could relate his 
tiresome time on an oceanography project for your 
edification. The experimental fiddler crabs had absorbed so 
much DDT from run off waters that their nervous systems 
were suffering the dt's and they were entirely too erratic to 
serve research purposes. You remember all that DDT talk, 
and it didn't all go away either. 

Breathe deep, friends. That air, it really won't go away. 
But it may soon be thicker than you think! 



A TRAUMATIC TIME 

Remember Tuesday? That was the day before 
yesterday when all the clocks 'gang agley' around here. 



if Kettler clocks told you that it was later than 
you felt. 

Since you were really on time, you didn't have to think 
up or produce any excuses. Excuses are usually for the 
birds, but Dr. Van Coufoudakis reminisced about a time he 
recalled when excuses were the birds. 

The American University at Beirut, Lebanon, has a 
beautiful campus. One of the prominent features is a tower 
with a giant clock which could easily be read from most 
locations on the campus. One could sprawl under a tree 
studying or reading and cast a cautionary eye at the Big 
Time in the sky And one could also be awfully wrong. Again 
and again, Dr. Coufoudakis remembers, students would 
timidly enter class as much as three quarters of an hour 
late due to Big Blunder. Poor clock, openfacediy he met the 
air, holding out his big arms. Large gulls and other bird life 
found those arms a perfect perch. Time and time again 
their weight threw Big Blunder out of sync. 

Science marched in. A shining chrome enclosed Swiss 
masterpiece replaced Big Blunder, and excuses simmed 
back into mundane deletions of truth. Ah! do you still 
remember that great perch in the sky, Jonathan Livingston 
Sea Gulp? 

EAR RESISTIBLE 

Tommy Franke and Mrs. Joan Eaton were standing in 
admiration of that travel display in the lobby of the Student 
Union. France enticed Tommy and she asked wistfully.

There were a few changes since last 
week's poll of the top ten teams. The top 
three teams remained the same, while the 
NBA Professionals moved from fifth to 
fourth as a result of Gemini beating the 
Walt Disney Memorial squad. 

The Heads climbed from an honorable 
mention position to number six taking the 
place of Ottenweller's. The remaining 
teams all moved up a spot with victories 
and Gemini captured the final spot.

M;iiiLii.'stos. Daisies, 



the Hoosiers won. the Boilermakers \ 
UCLA lost two, Notre Dame \ 

-back up. UCLA lost a pair? 



.Hey, 



In basketball? 

Yes, it's true, the kings of the court 
dropped two conference games to unranked 
teams— Oregon and Oregon State. But 
remember Oregon State beat the Indiana 
Hoosiers earlier this year and Bob Knight 
commented, "On a particular night Oregon 
State was capable of beating anybody inlhe 
country. They can play." And they sure 
proved it. 



Now, UCLA with an 18-3 record, is 
ranked number three. I didn't know that 
John Wooden taught his players how to 
count that high. Usually they can only 
master the term "one." The two teams 
ahead of the Bruins are North Carolina 
State and Notre Dame— who both have 
identical 20-1 records. The losses to these 
teams have come at the hands of the 
mighty Bruins. 

The last time that UCLA has lost two in 
a row was probably the same year Joe 
DiMaggio retired from baseball. It's really 
been a long time. 

Wooden said that his players just aren't 
hungry enough. Well, a few weeks without 
their dinner should do the trick. Now UCLA 
is faced with a "do-or-die" situation - they 
the remaining game against 



The Bruins proved that they aren't 
invincible, but they still rank as the 
favorites to win it all again this year. It's all 
up to Southern Cal, but earlier in the year 
UCLA won 64-55.- Maybe its time for a 
change. 

THE CHARM OF INTRAMURAL 
BASKETBALL 

If you have ever noticed the young lady 
who diligently keeps statistics at the 
intramural basketball games, her name is 
Peggy Jo Moord. 

Rick Werling, head of the program has 
stated, "I believe in equal opportunity -- 
especially when the girl's good looking." 
But this is not the first time a female has 
handled this job. 

So, when checking in at your next 
game, make sure you have a kind word for 
this diligent statistician (or else she'll put 
you down for an extra foul).
