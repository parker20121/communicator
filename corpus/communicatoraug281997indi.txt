Class of 2000 



BioOMiNGTON, IND— The Class of 
2000 entered college last fall. 
Thai's a sobenng thoughi lo (he 
Baby Boomers now waiehing iheir 
children's academic progress and 
wondering aboul their prospects 
afler graduation. Today's students 
are. obviously. ver&gt; different than 
those who entered college 25 years 
ago. but often not in the ways one 
woitld assume. 

According to an ongoing study 
of incoming freshmen by the Higher 
Education Research Institute at the 
University of California. Los 
Angeles, students who entered col- 
leges and universities in 1971, were, 
as might be expected, more politi- 
cally active and socially liberated 
than the freshman class of 1996 

But. in contrast lo the dircciion- 
less. self-absorbed image of 
Generation X'eis depicied in 
movies like Slackers and Clerks, 
members of the freshman class of 
1996 reporied that it was more 
important lo them to be well-off 
financially, raise a family and 
become experts in their chosen 
fields than their counterparts did 25 
years ago. 

The responses came as a sur- 
prise lo many of the retirement- age 
students who attended "Mini 
University 1997," lU's award-win- 
ning vacation college, this summer. 
Findings from the UCLA sludy, 
which covers a total of 30 years, 
were cited iji a clas,i taught by lU 
Dean of Students Richard McKaig. 

"The reasons students cite for 
selecting a particular college typi- 
cally include academic teputation. 
low luiiion and (he offer of financial 
assistance," McKaig said. "But one 
big reason — to get a good job — 
wasn't even a response option in 
1971. which says a lot about the per- 
ception of higher education at that 
time." 

In fad,, when asked about 
importani objectives for iheir lives, 
80 percent of the freshmen surveyed 



in 1996 cited being well-off fman- 
cially as an importani goal, com- 
pared to 40 percent of freshmen in 
1971 By contrast, in 1971. "devel- 
oping a meaningful philosophy of 
life" was the most frequently cited 
objective. 

In poUtical and social matters, 
today's freshmen showed them- 
selves lo be more conservative than 
the freshmen of 25 years ago. The 
percentage of students surveyed 
who described themselves as "liber- 
al" dropped from 35 percent in 1971 
10 21 percent in 1996, while the per- 
centage who called themselves 
"conservative" rose from 14 to 21 
percent 

When the students were asked 
how strongly they agreed or dis- 
agreed with several statements con- 
cerning public policy, their respons- 
es also reflected an increased con- 
servatism. Agreement with the state- 
ment, "The govenunent is doing 
enough to control pollution," 
decreased from 90 to 80 percent 
between 1971 and 1996. The per- 
centage of agreement with the state- 
ment, "There is loo much concern 
for the rights of criminaJs," rose 
from 48 percent in 1971 lo 75 per- 
cent in 1996. And the percentage of 
students in agreement with the siaie- 
ment. "The wealthy should pay 
more taxes than they do," decreased 
from 73 percent lo 66 percent. 

"I got one of my favorite letters 
about a month ago from a mother 
who was concerned about some of 
the things her son was getting 
involved in on campus," McKaig 
said "She wanted to know if 1 
thoughi they were cults. She said, 
'He's so darned conservative his 
father and 1 can'i quite understand 
him."' 

Next Week: Part Two— Class of 
2000's conservatism extends to per- 
sonal choices — drugs, sex, smoking 
and career

What's in a name 

The history behind campus buildings 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Great things can happen when a person of 
consequence is inspired by a dream. 
That is exacdy what happened in the 
case of Alfred W KetUer. Sr 

Tbe result of his dream? IPFW. 
It seems so simple - IPFW: Indian a- Purdue 
University at Fort Wayne. The name itself with 
its unassuming hyphen makes ii seem as if the 
two universities are ihe ones to credil with the 
institute of higher learning ihat came to be out of 
their merging 

Actually, Alfred W Keitler, a local business- 
man, wanted to bring higher education to nonh- 
casiem Indiana by combining programs from the 
Ihe stales two major universities: Indiana 
University and Purdue Universiiy. It is no won- 
der then, thai the building thai students seem to 
spend so much time in. especially when starting 
their collegiate years, is named after this man- 
While Ketiler's vision was very noble, il is a 
testimony of determination that his vision was 
carried out. Granted, he was noi without his 



opponents, ll was said that branch schools were 
no replacement for the education one could get if 
one went away. Bui with ihe implementation of a 
plethora of programs, it was clear that the only 
Ihing students did noi get while attending IPFW 
was homesick. 

In September 1927, five full-Ume students 
enrolled in Indiana University's Fort Wayne 
Center. The war years of the 1940's saw a drastic 
drop in enrollment as many people sought oppor- 
tunities to ;issLst in the war effon. Things picked 
up quickly afterward, and the end of World War 
II saw a more college-like atmosphere. 

The following is a brief history of some of 
IPFW's buildings: 

Kettler Hall - Alfred W. Keitler. Fori Wayne 
busines-sman, later a Purdue trustee. 

NelT Hall ^ Floyd R. Neff; director of 
Indiana University's Fort Wayne Center from 
1918-1951- 

Helmke Library - Waller E. Helmke, Fort 
Wayne attorney, Indiana University tnisiee, 

CIas.sraom-Medical Building - Obviously 
named for function, not benefactor. After years of 



Briefly . . . the news 



P^CoMMUNirr 



planning, the building was ready for use al the 
same time the newly created weekend college 
program was implemented It was intended to 
have four floors - Iwo for arts and letters class- 
rooms, one for music teaching and studios and 
one for the first two years of medical education, 

Walb Sludenl Union - Walter W. Walb; 
industrial plant openiior in Fon Wayne, later a 
Purdue trustee. 

The completion and naming of the buildings 
brought the need of further unification. The stu- 
dents as a whole needed a name. That dilemma 
was solved when Jack Sundennan. associate pro- 
fessor of geology, and other earth and space sci- 
ences faculty members helped a farmer near 
Angola unearth and identify what the farmer and 
his helper had partially uncovered. What they 
found were the remains of a young adult 
mastodon, aboul 18-20 years old. The skeleton 
was in good condition including the tusks and 
cranium. 

The fanner, Orcie Routsong, Sr, donated the 
oealurc to IPFW. After winning popularity in a 
student poll, the maslodon became the official 
campus mascot.

Commuters erasing poor reputation 



Br DotxE MiLLEn 
Chief Reporthh 

Tbe commuter-college typical- 
ly receives a bad reputation for 
being an adult version of high 
school or worse. The claim that a 
person is better enriched by going 
away to school is supported by the 
fact that being away from home is a 
catalyst for maturity for those who 
were lacking it. 

IPFW is the proud host of many 
organizations and activilies that are 
sure to promote penooal growth 
and in turn, enhance the university. 

Tbe Black Collegian Caucus 
(BCQ is located in Walb Student 
Union. Suite 118 It is an organiza- 



uon dedicated to die cultural and 
educational development of the 
African -American student and is 
open to anyone interested in 
African- American culture. 
According to Lynette Johnson- 
Lewis. BCC president, "Our prima- 
ry purpose is to raise money for 
scholarships tbat are awarded to 
deserving African- American stu- 
dents. The major criteria being that 
ihey arc a member of BCC." 

Many organizations wiL be rep- 
resented at the Student 
Organizational Fair, September 8. 

The Forensic League will also 
be at ibc Student Organizational 
Fan from II ajn. - I p.m. There 
will be flyers so tbat students know 
what i,^ going on "Preparations 
have already been made.' said 



Sarah Nichler of the Forensic 
League, "tournaments have been 
lined up already." 

Hispanos Unidos is going to be 
busy this semester, starting witb 
"La Gran Fiesta." which will begin 
on Friday, September 5. Live music 
by Diego Del Real and His New 
Sound will be featured. The live 
enlertainmenl starts at 6 p.m.. fol- 
lowed by a taco eating contest La 
Gran Fiesta continues on Saturday, 
September 6. witb two perfor- 
mances by El Ballet Folklorico 
Esludiantil from Michigan. 

The first perfonnance is from 
2:30-3:30 pjn., and the second is 
from 4:30-5:30 p.m. Get out your 
dancing shoes and salsa from 6 p.m. 
to midnight to the sounds of Super 
Bengala De Rio Bravo. La Gran 



Fiesta will run from 1 1 ajn. to mid- 
nigbt and will be beld at 
Headwaters Park. 

Tbe fiesta will also feature raf- 
fles and a children's festival. 

If it is imperaiive that students 
get involved in order to be success- 
ful, then there is no reason that all 
IPFW students can not be success- 
ful. 

There is something on campus 
for everyone -just select how you 
want lo be identified. 

There are organizations to fit 
nearly every talent, religion or 
miiiority group. 

Anyone who wants to get 
involved should attend the Studeni 
Organizaiiooal Fair, at the grassy

Brightest stars of the summer 



Bei/ond the screen: jeremy Ecen6arger 



This 

summer 

brought iis 

, fail share of 

A»,»V=1 scree-. Yet. 
" "T ^^J do people ever 
wonder wbal 
makes a 
movie a bit? 
Some may say 
it's ihe pro- 
ducer, oihers poini to the direclor , 
bul my choice lies with (he actor. 
They are the people thai bring our 
favorite characters to life right 
before our eyes. 

TTicreforc. it is my privilege to 
introduce the top ten actors and 
actresses who made the theater 
worth visiting over the summer. It 
was their talents that matk each 
particular movie worth the cost of 
admission. 

1. Lei me begin with this sum- 
mer's surprise sensation Rupert 
EvereiL While "My Besi Friend's 
Wcdrfing" was supposed to recog- 
nize the l^enLs of the great Julm 
Roberts and the up-and-coming 
actor Dennoi Mulroney. It was 
Everett who look the winnmg flag 
to the fmisb line. His performance 
as Roberts' gay male friend was 
nothing short of hysterical. 
Whether it was his looks, his style 
or the wonderful singing voice, 
audiences adored him. Rumors 
have it that an Academy Award 
nomination could evolve, I'L be 
crossing my fingers! 

2. At the end of spring, this 
actress was simply known as Ellen 
E)eGeneres' girlfriend, yet she man- 
aged to hold her own ground in 
"Volcano" last June. Ex-soap opera 
star Anne Heche moved up in star- 
dom. She and Tommy Lee Jones 
were too busy r^inning away from 
an overflowing volcano to worry 
about the tabloids controversy sur- 
rounding her. Yet, will the actress 
stay afloat amongst a pool of com- 
petitive actresses? My vote: Not 
for 100 long. 

3. It's bard enough to be a part 
of one blockbuster in a summer, yet 
you can imagine being die lead 
actor in two? Well, somehow 
Nicholas Cage seemed to pull it off. 
His movies "Con Air" and "Face 
Ofl" led the pack at both of their 
opening weekends Yet. with all the 
violence in his two pictures, does 
be have enough energy to keep it 
gomg? Yeah, I think so With a 
wife hke Patriaa Arquetie, I'm sure 
It won't be a problem. 



4. Sequels? How many more 
can we take? Well, if Uma 
Tburman returns for the next 
Batman feature, I'm sore audiences 
will too Her performance as the 
conniving Poison Ivy had audiences 
desperately desiring a little more of 
ber attention. Even with strong 
actors like George Clooney, Chris 
O'Donnell and Arnold 
Schwarzenegger in the picture, 
Tburman reigned as queen of the 
jungle Do we think she out-per- 
formed Michelle Pfeiffer's Cat 
Girl? My vole: No, I wouldn't go 
that far. 

5- Seen enough movies 
about (he presideni 
lately? Well, none 
will prepare 
you for 
the one 
portrayed 
in " Ai 
Force One." 
Harrison Ford 
portrayed the 
man as if be was 
Rambo, out foi 
blood Yet, his per- 
formance proved that 
this man refuses to just 
lay down and age. Gray 
hairs and all. he pushed his way to 
the top of the box office for a cou- 
ple of weeks. Nevertheless, it's 
bard lo imagine Clinton having the 
time lo do such things; be would 
probably have been too busy mess- 
ing around with the stewardesses 
and offering Hillary to the assas- 
sins: "Please, you can have her." 

6, Though menuoned earber, 
one lady whom many had given up 
hope on made quite a comeback 
this summer She may be a bttle 
older and wiser, yei she's still pKi- 
ty. That girl is Julia Roberts. With 
two hits, "My Best Friend's 
Wedding" and "Conspiracy 
Theory," this girl Is back on top. 
Surpnsingly enough, they were 
actually good flicks. Even more 
surprising, it was great to see a 
movie where Roberts doesn't actu- 
ally get the man. Yet, if you ask 
me. be made the wrong choice. 
Sorry, Cameron Diaz Her next pic- 
ture should be good loo; she'll be 
starring with Susan Sarandon m a 
drama later this year. Can one pic- 
ture handle two slar-siudded 




7, There's stiU action, more 
char^aer and whole lot of more 
pounds... yes. it's Sylvester 
Stallone and his new movie.

through so much and has never 
received much credit for his work. 
Beside the minor success of 
"Oiffhanger" a few years ago, this 
guy hasn't really struck it big since 
his "Rocky" and "Rambo" days. 
Yet his new picture surprisingly 
gives bim recognition. Of course, 
teaming him up with Harvey Keilel, 
Ray Liotta and Robert DeNiro did- 
n't hurt. See everyone, it ain't over 
til the fal boy sings. 

8 Though it was filmed on a 
low budget and filmed 
in a small city (Fori 
Wayne, to be 
exact) "In the 
Company of 
Men," should be 
mentioned in 
ibis article 
somewhere. 
So let's 
include 
Stacy 

Edwards, 
who porrrayed 
the deaf woman put 
through torture in the 
film. Anyone notice all the 
pubhcity that it's been getting in 
magazines lately? For those who 
have yet to see it, this poor girl is 
seduced by two men in ihe film, 
wbo make her fall in love and then 
Ihey leave ber Anyone put through 
that much heartstrain deserves a pal 
on the back. Hopefully, we'll be 
seeing her on the big screen again 
soon. 



9 With a huge hit last summer. 
it's bard to believe that things could 
get any better Yei. one man has 
made a career out of fightmg aliens. 
Drum roll, please ... it's Will Smidi. 
star of "Men in Black." This guy's 
cocky attitude has become bis sig- 
nature flair. For tlte second summer 
in a row. ibis man bas been a part of 
the higbesl-grossmg picture of the 
year. Do we see a third in the 
future? Rumor has it that Smith 
pl^s to return to the music mdusiry 
next. Will, slick with what you're 
doing, it seems lo be working just 
fme. 

10, With all the adults men- 
tioned. I found it fair to mentioned 
at least one child star. Yet, ihis 
child star does not seem to need any 
introduction. I'm talking about 
"Home Improvement" star 
lonathon Taylor Tliomas. At such a 
young age ibis guy has bad tbe 
opponimity to work with a number 
of outstanding actors, including 
Chevy Chase, Tim Allen and Billy 
Zane. Nevertheless, this guy seems 
to be able lo bold his own. This 
summer he starred in "Wild 
America " Too bad it wasn't too 
wild at the box office. Don't wony 
too much... his TV show is still 
going strong. 

So there you have it.... a run- 
down of the summer's besL My 
apologies to Jeff Goldblum. Jodie 
Foster, and Sandra Bullock. You 
were close — maybe next year.

Moon over Buffalo deVwers 



By Jereimv Ecenbarqer 
Staff Wrfteh 



"Summer may be over, but the 
fun seems to keep rolhng in. While 
shows like "The Best LitUe Whore 
House in Texas." Tunny Girl" and 
"Fiddler on the Roof." visited the 
city of Fon Wayne this summer, a 
new show IS visiting the Arena 
Dmner Theaiie, 719 Rockhill, that 
may just laugh them right off the 
stage. 

Last weekend, "Moon Over 
Buffalo" made its way to the stage. 
The show is a zany comedy about an 
acung couple struggling with hfe on 
the road. 

The story follows the acting 
couple, not exacdy the Lunts, who 
tour in Buffalo with a repertoire con- 
sisting of Cerano de Bergerac and 
Noel Coward's Private Lives Fate 
has given the two thespians one 
more shot at leading roles in a 



Scarlet Pimpernel epic. 
Furthermore, director Frank Capra 
himself is en route to Buffalo to 
catch their performances 

"It's the story of a married aa- 
ing couple who are 'has-beens' and 
are doing shows on tour." said 
Christopher Murphy, director of 
the pnxluction "Acung has 
always been their prion- 
ty, but they discover 
that their mar 
riage prob 
lems are 



He is usually on the stage, rather 
than behind it. 

Hilarious misunderstandings 
pile on madcap 
misadventures 
in the show 
Plus, all the 




acting 
problems," 

"Moon O v 
Buffalo" IS Murphy's directorial chaos is 
debut at the Arena Dinner Theatre, magnified by Charlotte's 



(the wife) deaf mother, who man- 
ages the couple's theater, 

"I love how fast-paced the sbow 
is," said Murphy. "The sets are 
always changing: something is 
always going on," 

The show stars Chris Colcord. 
Molly McCiay, Mickey Martin and 
Jim Nelson. It is wrinen by Ken 
Ludwig. 

Upcoming performances will 

take place on August 29 and 30 

and September 5 and 6. Diiuier

Hci/ hudd^^ jicrc e thu 



By Gail Ruble Crawfoad 

Featuhes Editoh 



Normally, mosi people aicn'l 
afraitl of magneis. However, i/ you 
have piercings in some of ibc unusu- 
al places ibat Benji Trciler docs, you 
may ihmk twice when faced with 
eilbcr Ibc noixb or souih end of a 
lodeslonc, Trelter, resident piercer at 
Primal Urge. 819 Calhoun Street, 
bas a total of 26 picrcmgs on his 
body 

Mark Wimere. piercer and co- 
owner al Future Tribe. 1521 Wells 
Sireeu has 17 piercings Wmiere has 
been piercmg in ibe Fori Wayne area 
for approximately three and one-halt 
years, 

Both studios see a variable num- 
ber of customers a day. Each pierc- 
ing takes approximately five to 10 
minutes. Piercings are completed 
with a sterile, mcdical-gradc hypo- 
dermic needle, not tbe gun used for 
ear piercings. 

Despite the recent surge in pop- 
utarily among Gcneration-X, pierc- 
ing is not a new phenomenon. 



Piercing the body is one of the old- 
est forms of body adommeni m 
existence. In fact it is possibly older 
than lalooing. According to Winters, 
each part of the body is pierced, his- 
torically, for a specific reason. 

Al Future Tribe, education about 
piercing and its historical signtH- 
cancc is a priority 

■'The only other studio that goes 
lo the same educational lengths thai 
1 know of is Nomad Body Piercing 
on the West Coasi," said Winters. 

Future Tribe's goal is to educate 
both themselves and oUiers aboul 
the histoncal origins of piercings. 

Acc&lt;vding to Tretter. pierang 
isn't just aboul stabbing a needle 
into a body pan, "Piercings have lo 
be placed in a certain spot. There's 
more to them than just slabbing. 
Piercing requires extensive trajn- 
ing," 

Tretter is currently Primal 
Urge's only piercer, but has a new 
piercer coming from California in a 
month or two. as well a local 
tramcc At Future Tribe, Winter, is 
the primary piercer, but co-owner, 
BaiT&gt; Terry, recently completed :i 
piercing apprenticeship. 

The most common place for 
men to be pierced is the tongue, and 





.Some goofing around wilh Ben Tretter from Pnmal Urge 



for women, the navel. Before you 
wuice in anticipated pain. Tretter 
adds. "Getting the tongue pierced 
hurts less than getung an earlobe 
pierced." 

Winters agreed, adding. "Mosi 
piercings don't bun. Cartilage pierc- 
ings are most painful. Most people 
are surprised thai the piercing's over 
with as quickly as it is," 

If you are worried about cleanli- 
ness, don't be. Both Primal Urge and 
Future Tnbe use sienle hypodermic 
needles and maintain gcrm-frce 
envirorunents. 

Considering the plices that you 
can gel pierced, post-piercing infec- 
tions aren't as prevalent as you 
would expect. "Infections in 
tongues are rare. Most piercings heal 
up pretty well, with proper care 
Belly buttons get infected more 
often, though." said Tretier 

According to Winters. "Oral 
piea-uigs heal faster — tongues don't 
get infected very often. There's a fal- 
lacy thai the piercer is responsible 
for infections. Piercings gel infected 
because people do dumb things like 
not keeping them clean or lugging 
on them ' 

While many people ask for mul- 



tiple piercings, both studios are 
skeptical about telling customers do 
loo much too fast to their bodies 
Future Tnbe has turned people away 
for wanting loo many piercings m 
one place at a time 

Widi the surge in recent popular- 
ity of piercing, both Primal Urge and 
Future Tribe take precautions to 
make sure dial minors don't gel 
pierced without parental permission 
Parents are required (o accompany 
iheir children lo each siudio At 
Primal Urge, minors can also bring a 
notarized statement giving them

Minutes later, a man took tbe 
stage to introduce Julian and 
Damien Marley and the Upnsing

when the mtro began A huge 
scTeen wrapped around the 
back of the stage, allowing 
three animated images of the 
cover of ■'Aeniina " The 
crowd was ecstatic as the 
band walked on-stagc. 
Maynard Kccnan stood there, 
building up aggression and 
surveying the crowd After a 
moment of getting a whole 
amphitheater full of people 
on the verge of bursting a 
capillary, the band slammed 
into "Hooker with a Penis" 
off their latest album, as the 
crowd let out a huge whoop 
of approval. 

Tool mostly stuck 
with tracks off Aenima. going 
back in lime to play "Sober" 
and "Prison Sex" off 
"Undertow." as well as one 
track from Opiate, their first 
jibum 

1 was feeling rather 
exhausted by die end of the 
set and decided to take a breather 
before "Prodigy" By now, a few 
new reporters and photographers 
were milling around tbe tent. 
"Prodigy" was the big hype this 
year and drew a few electronic 
music magazine writers out to see 
what the scoop was 

Close to 10 p m , we were all 
esconed one final time lo our pit, 
now crowded with guards, tour peo- 
ple, as well as two video cameras oti 
large risers "Prodigy's" stage set 
was massive. The DJ booth of Liam 
Howletl was a tall skyscraper- frame 
looking structure, quite impressive 
from my vantage point. 

When Prodigy came out in full 
force. Keiih Flint (the one with the 
hair) and MC Maxunum Reality 
raged around like tornadoes all 
hopped up on espresso and Snicken 
bars The first number wm hl^stins 
andl grooved along while snapping 
away, when suddenly the unexpect- 
ed happened. Hint came to the front 
of the stage, glowering at die crowd, 
and walked down a staircase into 
our pit. Before I knew it, be was 
doing a high wire act on the railing 
that separated us from the crowd. I 
was gleefully shooung off frames 
and waitmg for my flash to recharge 
(Prodigy was the only band lo allow 
flash photography by the way. 
Thank.', guys). Suddenly, Keith was 
not there anymore. He had Jumped 



of It all. I couldn't walk five feet 
without stepping into something 
attempting to separate people from 
their money The blatant, target- 
market commercialism of it all 
annoyed me. Thank God I'd eaten 
before I came and 1 didn't want any- 
thing pierced. 

Soon I decided ic head back to 
HQ, because it was almost time for 
die next stage I act. I was quite 
pleased lo fmd out that it would be 
James, one of the reasons 1 wanted 
to do this in die fu^t place We got 
to tbe pit. and the scqum-dad musi- 
cians trotted on-stage Their set was 
as good as 1 bad hoped it would be 
The fact that they played their 
biggest hit. "Laid," early on did not 
deter from the rest of their perfor- 
mance, which included songs from 
their latest album "Whiplash." 

I made my way through hawk- 
ers, hippies, headbangcrs, hip- hop- 
pers and dejected looking teenagers 
wearing Kom shirts. 

Next on mainstage was Tneky, 
a son of rap/techno artist. He put on 
a good show, but 1 must confess that 
I was unfamiliar with most of bis 
material, despite having previously 
listened to his latest CD, "Pre- 
MiUennium Tension" I soon left bis 
set. because 1 didn't want to miss 
Pugs over at stage 2. 1 bad beard 
Uiey were interesting, and found out 

I had not been misinformed The 

garish Marilyn Monroe meets Sid ,o ,j,y noor in the crowd, who wwe 
Vicious in a trailer park look of the seaming to touch him He didn't 
band was enough to raise the eye- ^y^y ihgre for long though. I was 



brows of even iod;iy's nearly uni 
pressable youth. Tlieir sound was 
bard-edged with catchy guitar 
hooks that even the skinheads 
moved around a Utile to. 

After a bit of a wait, it was 
finally time to be led like a four- 
year-old to the pit again, to shoot 
one of the big boys of the show 
"Are y'all reddy f'dis?!!" Snoop 
came on-slagc rather low-key, 
despite the frenzy that bis arrival 
aeated The same crowd ihat had 
not so long ago seemed as if their 
asses were made of cement, were 
now all on dieir feet. I hung around 
in the lawn after tbc first three songs 
and did some crowd shots while the 
Dogg grooved on. 

Then, after much ado. ihe 
moment I had been wailing for 
arrived Tool was about to take tbe 
stage. I calculated the film I had left. 
and made it easily accessible, so 
diat 1 would waste no time while 
taking pictures of one of my 
favorite bands. 

It was nearly time. I was stand- 
ing in the pit feeling a htile anxious 



expecting him to be escorted back 
to the stage then, but no! He totally 
took me by surprise when he 
jumped up and crowd surfed all the 
way to die lawn and back. 

In diis day and age of overzeal- 
ous security and musicians detach- 
ing themselves from their fans, I 
was impressed. For being fairly new 
to tbe US large stage scene. 
Prodigy came aaoss very well and 
the fans were pumped. They ended 
their time on-stage with 
"Firestarter" while 1 made up my 
mind to purchase Fat of tbe Land. 

After it was all over, despite tbe 
aluiudes, conunercialiim, underage 
"hipper than ibou" brais, and stupid 
side events (die "Bramforresi" with 
its vegetarian agenda, and the 
'Temple", which was basically a 
sinpper show) I left feeling pretty 
content As a matter of fact, 1 was so 
content and satisfied, that 1 can 
only remember a few times during 
the day when I was wishing I'd 
gone to H.O.RD£. instead.

Military needs to be 
liarbaric for country's sake 

Two years ago, ihe country mUttary background. They seem to 



watched as a lone woman entered 
an aJI-malc military iiuttiution. The 
woman iniendoJ to be the fml to 
complcic the cruel initiation of 
South Carolina's Citadel She 
failed miserably, The courts ordered 
her into The Giadel before she was 
mentally or physically able The 
Citadel also wa.s not prepared for 
accepting their first female in near- 
ly 200 years. 

On August 
20, 30 women 
entered another 
all-male mili- 
tary academy. 
Virginia 
Military 
Institute opened 
its doors Ux the 
first lime to 
women cadets. 
To VMI\ cred- 
it, they had a 
year lo prepare 
for this drastic 
overhaul of 
their belief sys- 
tem. And 10 the 
women's acdii 
they bad the

Faulkner never

This does 
not mean thai 
some of these 
women will 
fail. Some will. 
as well as some 
men, Bui at 
least these 
women will 
have a chance 
lo bond wiib 
iheir female 
counterparts. 
They will 
develop the 
bond the men 
have enjoyed ai

will have a sup- 
pon system for

down to a point 
they have never

VMI graduates bad. Men like 
Stonewall Jackson and George S. 
Pation VMI has pledged it will not 
tolerate sexual harassment in any 
fonii. But then again, when is a 
young man yelling at a young 
woman not sexual harassment? 

There are quite a few cniics of 
the "Rai System" VMI has m place 
(New cadets are christened "rats" 
by the upper classmen). Most of the 
critics seem to come from outside a 



haven for those who tbink its all 
nght to have "blue days." The fecl- 
gooders would make drill sergeants 
and drill instructors behave more 
like camp counselors than like 
molders of fighting men and 
women. 

As a country, we tnay be out- 
raged by the glimpse of barbarism 
we get through CNN. but that bar- 
barism has allowed us to be a free 
country for the last 219 years 



think that the country does not need 
to dehumanize people to create the 
military force of this country. 

This idea could not be further 
from the truth. Recruits and cadets 
need to go through rigorous mental 
and physical training to prepare for 
the cnals of war. 

As a country, we should want 
our fighting men and women to be 
die hardest and 
toughest in the 
country, if not 
Ihe world It 
would be foolish 
for our country 
to try and make 
the military 
"user friendly" 
It's not sup- 
posed to be! 

The mil- 
itary prides 
Itself into mak- 
ing lough fight- 
ing men and 
women out of 
boys and girls 
who have never 
had the disci- 
pline the mili- 
tary offers 
Unforiunately 
for the military, 
a bunch of "feel- 
good pansies" 
have been fight- 
ing the so-called 
dehumanizing 
aspects of the 
military These 
people are the 
kind of people 
that were borri- 
f led at the 
videotaped pin- 
ning ceremony 
of the Marines 
shown on CNN 
Yes it was bar- 
baric, bui since 
when have we 
asked are mili- 
tary to be any- 
thing but barbar- 
ic? 




These are the days 



Here comes the rei/olution:Jo/iM Koenig^ 



a: 




back to school 
time Once 
again the hour 
is upon us to 
take pen in 
band and com- 
mence our 
note-taking 
and essay- 
writing. Once again we read and 
study the wisdom if the ages, the 
insights of sages and scholars. Truly, 
to learn is lo live But we must ever 
be wary not to lake this rare privi- 
lege lightly. 

And a privilege it is Think for a 
moment of all the people in coun- 
tries where higher education — 
indeed, any education at all — is 
eidier impossible or prohibited due 
10 famine, poverty or political ideol- 
ogy These people merely DREAM 
of the opponuniiies that are practi- 
cally delivered to our doorstep 

We also have ihe chance, 
through educaiion, to leam more 
about the world and how lo alter our 



destinies than our 
grandparenls ever 
thought possible. 
In turn, we can 
miraculously pass 
on this collective 
knowledge lo our 
children, in the 
hope that they will 
avoid making the 
same mistakes thai 
we've made during 
our tenure on 
earth. 

Now, I know 
many of you are m ^^^^^S^^ 
a hurry to complete 
your degree program as quickly as 
possible in order lo be able to enter 
the job markei and make a bazillion 
dollars in ten years I understand this 
mentably completely, as being with- 
out sufficient funds breeds insecuri- 



WE can MIRACU- 
LOUSLY PASS ON 
THIS COLLECTIVE 

KNOWLEDGE TO OUR 

CHILDREN, IN THE 

HOPE THAT THEY 

WILL AVOID MAKING 

THE SAME MISTAKES 



■ Thercarc, howev-"

that accompany this 
brand of "gimme" 
philosophy First of 
all, no matter how 
well any of us per- 
form in school, 
there are no guaran- 
tees thai we're in 
die right place at the 
right lime to get the 
ideal occupation 
So, try to enjoy 
school while you're 



Second, contrary 
to popular myth, money does nol

material possessions, and yet be able 
to appreciate these modest wonders 
is, in my humble opinion, true 
poverty. So, iry lo enjoy school 



while you're-in ii. 

These are just two of many rea- 
sons why we all must take these glo- 
rious college days by the reins and 
allow Uiem to guide us to unknown 
territory We must revel m die faci '. 
that we have the opportunity to 
attend an institution of higher learn- 
ing, others aren't so fortunate. We 
must noi waste one moment Uiink- 
ing that school is a drag and that we 
wish we were already working 
instead. As someone who wailed 
nine years before returning to col- 
lege. I can attest to the fact that work 
is just that, work It can be boring, 
dull, repetiiive and a whole other 
slew of negaiively connotative 
adjectives. 

School can be work also. Bui 
more than that, it is a journey A 
journey to discover who we are, 
why things are what they are. what 
they will become and what it all 
means. That, my friends, is a privi- 
lege, 

Ahh. yes Back to school time, 
A Lime of learning and illuminating. 
A time of living. Certainly, these are 
die days.

Ratmaze confuses campus 



As if we 
didn't feel 
enough like 
rats m a maze, 
the university 
built a circular 
■■ r o u n d - a ■ 
bout" on the 
west side of 
campus. This 
confusing 
wonder of 
19ih century 
urban plan- 
ning has made 
the roads 
around IPFW 
even more 
messed up 
than usual. 

Why 
would the uni- 
versity use 
some bizarre 
plan like a 

round-a-boui when we have such 
technological advances as the stop 
light, Ihe flashing tight, the yield 
sign or die stop sign? 

Round-a-bouLs were probably 
great during the horse and buggy 




days of yote. bul in today's age of 
the horseless carriage, round-a- 
bouts are only practical in cities Uke 
Grabill or Beme, Anyone who has 
driven around the monument in Indy 
can vouch for the complete cluster- 
fuc* in die heari of the "Circle 



dent who gets caught 
in the round-a-boui. 

Those people caught in the rai 
maze will not have a chance to get 
to a parking place and get their ra( 
pellet for fimsbing the maze.

and during ihal year be helped our 
team fmish second m the league 

We went lo the same high school

surrounded his murder and won-

man who gave up his life for his fel- 
low otTicer I tned lo remember if 
there was anything from ihe brief 
lime I knew him ihai would have 
signaled this kind of selfless behav- 
ior. 

I'm sorry, but I cannot. 1 never 
knew him thai well. He was just a 
kid who loved lo play baseball. 

1 saw somcthmg ui this iowti 
thai I hadn't noticed before On Itae 
Saturday after his death, 1 was dri- 
ving past a diner. There was a guy 
lowering ihe Amcncan flag on the 



pole oul from. 

I bad just Hnished writing 
Eryk's obiluary for the News- 
Sentinel and found myself bemg 
afTccicd by his death. Usually I am 
not. because you musi become 
immune to ibe end-

came ihai and 
became numb. 

I never 

mourned for the 
fi ve -year-old 
Amisb boy who 
drowned. I never 
mourned for any- 
one. 1 was doing a 
job. 

After Eryk's 
death I was remind- BASE 

ed of a leacber 1 had 
bad in junior high 
He fought m World 
War II and was sta- 
tioned in Northern 
Afnca. His job was 
to load up all the 
dead bodies into 
trucks for transport 
to a cemetery. 

He told us aboui bow he could- 
n't think about them being actual 
human beings. He had lo ihmk of 
them as meat or cargo or anything 
but a fellow soldier. 

To a lesser extent 1 became like 
him The people 1 wrote obits for 



were no longer dead people, they 
bad become a few inches of copy 
They had become services or calling 
hours. 

Eryk's death woke up a bit of 
compassion in me that I thought wa.s 
as dead as the peo- 
ple I wrote about 

I still cannot allow 
myself to be con- 
sumed by someone's 
death, but I still can 
lake the time to feel 
something for that 
person and ibeir

upon a time, other voices, other 
roorDs. voices lost and clouded,

Truhaan Capote. "Other Voices, 
OiHEH Rooms" 



Sometimes I feel so incredi- 
bly lost. I feel like 1 dhfdng 
through the days of my life 
with no direction, no dreams, no 
goals. 

Yes. of course I have dreams, 
but somewhere along the way they 
son of faded into the background of 
my "life." 

I've let almost 23 years fly by 
and 1 have yet to do all of tho.sc 
things that 1 swore I would do 
befOTE I turned 25 

The clock is ticking, counting 
down, and I haven't done one 
danmed diuig (o reach some of my 
goals. 

Sure, I can rationalize my slow- 
ness in goal-reaching with tired 
lines about how busy I've been. 

Yeah, dial's it . . I've just been 
busy Too busy to follow my 
dreams 

Too busy with college, my mar- 
riage, my job — frankly, just to 
damned busy with my own life. 



However, I'm growing weary 
of being too busy. I'm sick of tbe 
monumental dust bunnies that grow 
on my hopes and plans every day. 
drowmng out everything that 1 have 
ever wanted to do in my life 

1 guess that life leads us to 
believe tbat every time a so-called 
"big" life event occurs, we'll auto- 
matically move closer to our goals. 

Ah, but my buddy faie once 
again gets tbe last laugh. 

Just because you get married or 
graduate from college or get that 
high-paying Job that you wanted 
does not gua/aniee immediate 
dream gratification 

I've written it before, and I'll 
write it again — nothing is ever that 
simple Dreams don't just hap- 
pen— diey require work and dedi- 
cation Each of us IS put on this 
planet for a purpose, believe it or 
not Wort' you got here is a moot 
point 

But if you want to make a mark 
in this world — or even if your 
dream has nothing lo do with mak- 
ing a inark — sometimes you just 
need a kick -start. 

There comes a time when it 
dawns on you that you need to lake 
responsibility for your goals and 
you need lo take the responsibility 
to do what it takes to make them 
come true. 

And that's where 1 stand at this 
juncture in my life, searching out 
my responsibilities. 

I have always wanted- to be a 
writer, but for years found a reason 
to put off my dream for one more 
day. 

1 began writing less and less, 
putting away my essays and poetry 
for proposals, transaction reports 



and research papers. Well, I recent- 
ly got a wake-up call. 

The proverbial light went on in 
my brain — If I wanted to make my 
dream a reality. I needed to begin to 
write again. 

So I look pen in paper (okay, so 
I write at a computer, give me 
points for eloquence, please) and 
got myself a job here at The 
Communicator. 

At first, I was petrified that I 
couldn't handle the commitment on 
top of my full-time job, school and 
a life 

However, I've surprised 
myself I find myself making time 
lo do this, making time to write, 
making time to express myself like 
1 did until a few years ago — in 
shon, making nme lo follow my 
dreams. 

I have always wanted to see my 
name in print and here it is. It real- 
ly was that simple. 

My dream is on its way lo ful- 
fillment. And I, for one, am dam 
piDud. and nothing nor no one can 

keep die future from me now 

I may not have much, but I 
have my dreams and they live again 
in my soul. 

Thai's a powerful feeling. As 
William BuUer Yeats wroie, "But 1, 
being poor, have only my dreams; I 
have spread my dreams under your 
feet; Tread softly because you uead 
on my dreams" ("He Wishes for 
Cloths of Heaven")

said Dutcher 

Amanda is 
majoring in biology 
and would like to 
work in a police lab. 
This is her dream. She claims that 
she will never let herself rely on 
social services 

"Being a single mother helps me 
be more determined because 1 will 
never be on welfare 1 have to keep 
myself from being on it so 1 study 
hajd." said Dutcher 

My other fnend. "Ellen." is a 
single mother of five Ellen is alone 
most of the time and often feels as if 
she IS constantly being brushed aside 
by other IPFW students. 

Ellen, unlike Amanda, cannot 
always afford child care for Tive 
chddrcn and on occasion brings her 
daughter to her classes. It is also dif- 
ficult for Dlen to make friends to 
study with who accept her 

i have attended class with Ellen 
and have witnessed bow other stu- 
dent at IPFW form cliques around 
her dunng study times In spite of 
this kind of juvenile behavior. Ellen 
remained poised and elegant at her 



dren. 

Single mothers 
should be praised 
instead of abandoned 
during class. 

"Robert" is also a student at 
IPFW The most common assump- 
tion people make when [hey discov- 
er he is a single parent of a boy is 
that Robert does not have custody 
of the child 

"The first thing they ask is. 
How often do you see him?" said 
Robert. 

Like other single parents. Roben 
also finds it difficult to study. 

"It's dinicult to study when he's 
awake because he's only in kinder- 
garten," said Robert. 

As students we must make a 
conscious effort to accommodate 
these single parents when diey need 
resources. 

It IS ridiculous that these indi- 
viduals are sometimes treated poorly 
by other students when in fact they. 
like you. have the same goal. 

Single parents who are also col- 
lege students should be praised 
because they motivate and inspire

Student kicks off season 



; By Scott Warden 

'. Spofits Reporteh 

; Tlic lanky while kid sat on tbe 
cemeoi benches and smiiked as be 
cbomped his gum. Tbe while oum- 
ber lOonhisiedjei^ey malchedhis 
white bat. which was on backwards 
as be was sunounded by scores or 
six and seven-year-old autogiapb 
seeken. 

Tbe gleam in Brian Clawson's 
eyes were nearly as big as those of 
Ihc children be was engulfed in as 
(be River City Rbino kicker was 
kmked upon by these elemeoiary 
schoolers with nothing less than 
having a celebrity status. 

After tbe River City — Fori 
Wayne's semi-pro footbaJl team — 
edged out the Chicago Panthers 20- 
14 Sunday at South Side High 
Scbool. the kids were allowed mto 
tbe Rhinos' locker room where they 
waited for tbe players to sign their 
programs. 

A majority of the team didn't 
lake tbe whole thing very serious- 
ly, but the 20- year-old 
Ciawson waited until ~ 

his John Hancock 
was given to every- 
one who wanted iL 

"It was differ- 
ent," said Ciawson, 
wbo is majoring in 
elementary educa- 
tion at IPFW. "rm 
not used to kids 
coming up and 
wanting my auto- 
graph, but 1 had fun 
doing il and it was obvi- 
ous by looking ai the kids that 
ibey really appreciated iL You can 
see (be look in their eyes and you 
know that they aaually believe that 
you're important. I guess to them 
you are." 

Feeling like a celebrity is one of 
the only perks for a Rhino player 
Not only do tbey not get paid for 
playing, but tbey also have to buy 
their own equipment: Their com- 
pensation — getting to play the 
game that they love. 

Tbe 1995 graduate of Elmhursi 
High School knew kicking was bis 



calling as soon as he was introduced 
to the game. 

"[ started kicking in fourth 
grade," Ciawson said. "A bunch of 
friends of mine got me into football 
and we sianed waichmg a Bears' 
game and I remember thinking thai 
the coolest position was the kicker." 

River Cily is in its second year 
of existence and Ciawson has been 
the team's place kicker for both sea- 
sons. 

"Brian is the most improved 
player that wc have from last year to 
this year — wilh- 
oui a doubt." 



Rbino 
coach 




Archie Lunsey. "Last year his legs 
weren't strong and we pui bim on a 
weight program and be has just 
done some tremendous things to 
improve the way be has 

"I think he's stronger now Last 
year he didn't realize what be had lo 
do, but he's worked at it and he's 
gomg to be a great kicker m this 
league."- - - - -- 

Ciawson knows thai right now 
kicking is only for fun — a hobby 
more or less. 

Td like to kick for as long as I 
can," Ciawson said "I'm not going 



to Slop working at iL I know thai it's 
just for fun, but if anyone would 
approach me with a chance to kick 
ai a higher level. I'd love lo. 1 know 
I need an education and teaching 
would be great, but if someone feels 
that I'm good enough to kick some- 
where professionally. I wouldn't 
think twice about doing iL" 

Teaching, however, isn't some- 
thing thai Ciawson sees as a fall- 
back occupation. His love for kids 
was evident as he signed program 
after program. 

"Since my Junior year in high 
school I've wanted lo be an 
elementary teacher," 
Ciawson said "My 
mom noticed that I 
was really good 
with kids and she 
suggested it and 
I just loved the 
idea. 1 have so 
much fun with 
kids. We used 
to have a 
bunch of httle 
kids live 
down the 
street and I'd 
spend a few 
hours with them 
every day jusi 
playing basketball 
or whatever. Il gave 
them something lo 
do and I loved doing 

Ciawson is only 
taking two classes this 
semester, but he's got more 
unponant things on his mind. 

"School isn't a complete priori- 
ty now," said Ciawson. "1 wouldn't 
mind going back to scbool full-lime, 
bui I'm planning on getting married 
nent June, so I'm working full-time 
trying to get ready for that, 

"Marriage is my number one 
goal right now I'd like to get my 
degree out of the way soon and have 
kids, play some football and just 
have fun. 1 jusi want lo.be_happy.''_ 

So he sal on the concrete slab in 
front of his locker with a smile on 
bis face as tbe kids swarmed to him 
as if be were srane great kicking 
idol. One day he may be.

was a "smoke screen" to avoid pub- 
lic discussion and criticism on the 
larger issue of employee pensions 

"We have trouble understandmg 
why the Teamsters are spending so 
much rhetonc on the issues of pan- 
lime jobs and subcontracting has 
been addressed in our final offer 
(see graphic)," said UPS spokesman 
Ken Stemad 'It seems to us that the 
union is using these issues as a 
smoke screen to avoid discussion on 
a pension proposal that is good for 
our people but not acceptable to the 
union leadership " 

UPS issued a good deal of infor- 
mation concerning pan-time and 
fuU-tmie jobs 

• Average UPS pan-time work- 
ers earn Sll per hour 
Approximately 60.000 pan-Lmers 
earn more than S16,000 annually 

• All UPS pan-timers have com- 
prehensive benefits packages that 
include health insurance, dependent 
coverage, a retirement plan, vaca- 
tions and hohdays. 

• Over the last four years, more 
than 13,000 UPS pan-timers have 
moved into full-time positions The 
company also added 8,000 new full- 
lime jobs 

• UPS said that no full-time 
employee has ever been replaced by 
a pan-time employee 

"Most part-time employees 
working at UPS are people who 
want to woric pan-lime work For 
eiumple. tens of thousands of our 
employees are students who are 
putting themselves through school 
with one of the best pan-time jobs in

America," said Stemad. 

The UPS management maybe 
coirect in saying that some of what 
the teamsiers were fighting for was 
the pension plan The Teamster's 
website bad a section called "UPS 
Victory Saves Pension Plans for All 
Teamsiers " 

UPS wanted to absorb the pen- 
sion plans of their workers and take 
them out of the hands of the union.s 
The Teamsters use a multi -employer 
plan that mingles payments from 
competitors of UPS 

"There is no reason why UPS 
should be forced lo subsidize its 
competitors, giving our employees 
less," said Lea Soupata. UPS senior 
vice president for human resources. 
"By creating a new plan, we can 
ensure that we arc giving UPS dol- 
lars to UPS people and that our 
workers get the very best pension 
plan available." 

But, "the Teamsters have called 
the contract "one of the most impm- 
lanl victones for Amencan working 
people in our hfeimies." 

The finalized contract between 
UPS and the Teamsters allowed the 
pension plan to stay with Teamster 
plans "with better or equal benefits 
than the company offers for almost 
all wortters " 

"It's a fantastic victory for peo- 
ple who work for a living. We hope 
to turn the (ide on the pan-timing of 
America, " said John EJobbin Sr . 17- 
year UPS driver. 

UPS officials were just as opti- 
misUc as union members were The 
company launched a nationwide 
media campaign carrying the mes- 
sage, "We're back. We are sorry for 
the disruption caused by Uie stnke 
We have a five-year contract to 
ensure your confidence in our ser- 
vice" 

"We are confident that this con- 
tract will allow UPS to remain com- 
petitive and in a position to grow our 
business in the coming years. It rep- 
resents the ftfst five-year contract 
ever signed with the union," said 
UPS CEO James P Kelly
