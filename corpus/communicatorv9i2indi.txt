Marlene Guynes is a personnel action 
and postal officer for the 194th Armored 
Brigade at Fort Knox. She became an 
Army officer after a year as an executive 
administrative assistant at a major mid- 
western university. 

"Women are treated much differently in 
the Army than they are in the outside 
world. The Army's opened doors to women 
in employment that corporations on the 
outside haven't yet opened. We still have 
some problems when it comes to getting 
certain jobs. For instance, sometimes it's 
difficult for a woman to get a command. 
But there's a lot more opportunity for ad- 
vancement in the Army than in a lot of 
other organizations. 

"In my primary job as chief of the per- 
sonnel action section, I have five people 
working for me. We handle any ac- 
_ tions which deal with the careers of the 
i«„i 5000 people within the brigade... branch 
transfers and discharges, applications for 
otticers candidate school, awards and decorations, and extensions on active duty As 
brigade postal officer, I have about 110 people. Even some captains and lieutenants, 
who are the posh, ! officers lor nmls subordinate In the brigade, are responsible to me in 
Nun capacity." 

You can prepare for' responsibility as an Army officer while you're earning your 
college degree. Army ROTC offers you leadership courses resulting in your officer's 
commission upon graduation. 

"The best thing I've learned to be as an officer is flexible. Because you face continuous 
change in the requirements of your job. It's challenging to come into a new situation 
and have to take charge. You'll have some prior training, but mostly academic. And 
you have to gel organized and do the job. Just since I've been here, we've completely 
reorganized the section so that we've reduced the turnover time on personnel actions 
from two days to three or four hours. 

"As an Army officer, you become ready to meet any challenge or job that's put in 
front of you, even some things you know absolutely nothing about. But if you were to 
leave the Army after three years, this type of experience would make you a lot more 
employable in the outside world."
