Independence 
a bad move 



ITDLDYOUrrWASCMRW 
H— OUTTDLW.' 



Forensic students 
-national qualifiers 



Sen. Richard Worman, R-Lco, might 
Introduce legislation to the General 
Assembly next spring asking thai IPFW 
become a separate university. 

Worman believes thnl such a move 
would provide more money to the 
university If it is not part of Indiana or 
Purdue universities. 

While the state should provide more 
money to IPFW, that alone isn't a good 
enough reason to split From the mother 

The biggest reason not to change has 
to do with degrees. Graduates of IPFW 
receive either an IU degree or a Purdue 
degree, Many students attend IPFW 
with the hope of some day earning an IU 
or a Purdue degree, not a Fort Wayne 
l-niversily degrce. 

IPFW has made great strides in the 
community in gaining recognition. 



Employers locally may not mind if the 
degree says IU, Purdue or Fort Wayne 
University. An employer in Chicago. 
New York or somewhere else, howi 
may hire a graduate from IU or Purdue 
over Fort Wayne University. 

Before Worman introduces such 
legislation, he must realize that it has 
taken IPFW 20 years U&gt; establish itself 
as a "real" university in the minds of 
many around the community. It might 
take Fort Wayne University twice as 
long. 

Another thing Worman should con- 
sider is how many people will leave 
IPFW if a change does come about. 

If Worman wants to help IPFW, he and 
the other northeast Indiana legislators 
should lobby the legislature for lower 
tuition, an animal care facility and a fine
