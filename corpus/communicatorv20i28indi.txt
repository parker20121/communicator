Opinion 



The Communicator 



Students' Government 
should not have control 
of newspaper's funding 



If experience is the besi leaehei 
then the experience of the last two 
years teaches that the student 
senate should have nothing to 



per credit hour, up 

of $24. One half of this mm icy i-'."r . 
to athletic programs. The other 
half goes to Students" Govn nmcnl 
Every April, the student senate 
decides how to spend its share &lt;&gt;i 
the money. Among the many things 

5000 subscr

Students' 






The :

purpose for the ru;T :;:; -.ehoui vm. 

In April 1988, The Comm e.iioi 

asked for a slight increase Instead, 
the senate proposed to cut The 

Communicator's budget to v'u.nou 

was $3,000 restored. 

This vear, The Communicator 
asked for only S25,000-the same 
amount it had received the year 
before. It was rewarded with a 15 
percent cut, to $21,250. 

It WOUld be tempt Dili lo rein hide 
that The Communicator simply 
came up on the tail end ol this year 
budget battles. But even if this 

i disadvantage. 



•efore, in any budget 

interests of The Communicator are 
Liu.inmteed to lose every time. 

Also, Purdue regulations prohibit 
officers of student organizations to 
be paid, including, 
government officials 

i.ihv lent officers have been 

able to evade these regulations, but 
every year at budget time. 
students 1 Government faces the 
lineal that its officers will go 
unpaid the next year. Since The 

i'( iniicator is a not-for-profit 

corporation, not a student 
organization, the student editors 

Student senators clearly resent 
the fact that editors are paid while 
Students' Government officers are 
not, no matter how faulty the 
enmpariMin is. And until Purdue

Instead of having The Commu- 
nicator receive an allocation from

None of the student orga 
has the responsibility ol repnrlmj; 
on Students' Government, No 
student organization has the re-

then to lobby. For The 
Communicator to engage in lobby- 
ing could only

small m the neighborhood of one- 
sixteenth of the total funds 
generated by the fee. 

This plan would benefit everyone. 
The Communicator would not have 
to worry about being terrorized for 
ii- opinions. It would even free the 
student senate from charges of 
censorship. But most of all it 
would protect the readers of 
The Communicator, who could rest 
assured that the paper was not

dreaded astronomy exam. 

On the other hand, Vivarin gives you the definite advantage. It helps 
keep you awake and menially alert for hours. Safely and conveniendy. So 
even when the subject matter's dull, your mind will stay razor sharp. 

If Galileo had used Vivarin, maybe he could have mastered the solar
