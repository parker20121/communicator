Twenty- four guests attended the 
Student Senate meeting Oct. T. It was, 
as one senator described "a more than 
average crowd," but if the crowd came 
lo be heard, it was disappointed. 

Many of the guests came In response 
lo a week-long "come and see for 
yourscir' camfiaign put on by mem- 
bers, as well as opponents of the ScnBtc, 
Nevertheless, Good of the Order, the 
lime for both setia tors and guests lo air 
their \Hews, was slated at Ihe end of the 
agenda and began with only five 
minutes of the regular meeting left. 

The meeting's SO minulc lime limit 
ran out after only Hve of Ihe senators 
had commented: none of the guests had 
been given the opportunity to speak. 

"Plenty of people I know went to that 
mceling lo speak in favor of the Senate. 
It upset me that no one was heard, 
cither pro or ran," said Wendy Welch, 
one of the author? of the petition to 
Impeach student body president Ken 
Sciienk, and a guest at the meeting. 

Up until two meetings prior lo this 
one, Ihcre was no time limit on the 
meetings. But in order lo encourage 
verbose members to 



lethc 

suspend this rule takes a 
tw.-0-thirds majority vote of the Senate; 
although the motion was made twice 
during Ihe meeting 11 was voted down. 
This was Ihe first time a suspension 
was not passed since the lime limit was 
impteed. "It was the lir?l time Ihe 
meeting ended on time." added Suzy 
Scare, a student senator. 

"Ellen (Englemanl made a mislahei 
an agreement was made before ihe 
meeting lin an executive session 
composed of Senate committee 
chairpeopic) that the Good of Ihe Order 
would be after adjournment," said Ken 
Schenk, student body president. 

Engleman. the sludenl body vice 
president and presiding officer of the 
Senate meetings said. "Since Good of 
Ihe Order is on agenda item, I didn't 
Ihlnk that we could have it after the 
meting. I Inter checked this with Jeff 
Sandy (Senate pariimcnlarianl and he 
agreed. This point was brought out in 
theexecutlvesession."

Engleman added. "I think that it is a 
slinking shame that Ihe students didn't 
gel to speak at the meeting, but I didn't 
slop the meeting — standing rules 
stopped the meeting. 1 cannot extend 
the meeting, and the senators voted two 
limes not to extend the meeUng. 

"I hate to think the meeting was 
ended as some kind of strategy play, in 
order not to hear the students' com- 

"The first time we voted not lo 
suspend Ihe rules it was early in the 
meeting and I didn't feel that we would 
need the time." said Holden Maecker, 
student senator. "The second lime, I 
felt that we had finished business and 
were ready lo close." 

Tom Harris, another senator added. 
"1 was tmaware thai the audience had a 
presentation and there was no con- 
spiracy on the part of the senators." 

"It was unfortunate that Ihe rules 
were not suspended, because the 
senators didn't speak, the students 
didn't speak, and Dean Uhncr didn't 
speak." said Steve Westrick. student 
senator. "Perhaps we were unfair, but 
we had to draw theline somewhere."

All the momentous events which lake 
place daily at IPFW will soon be sub- 
ject matter of a weekly news program 
produced by Young People in Broad- 
casting. 

The program, "Campus Scene" will 
be entirely wrillen, reported, and 
edited by students and will appear on 
Fort Waj-ne Cablevision Channel 23, a 
channel accessible to all city college 
campuses. 

ScotI Kuhn is the vice president of 
YPBC and its neu,s coordinator. "We 
want lo present campus events in a way 
that is interesting to the community," 
Kuhn said, while talking with TTie 
Communicator in the combination 
office and editing room located in Ihe 
basement of the Heimke Library. 

Forty people currently are Involved 
m yPBC, Kuhn said. "We have a good 
nucleus of interested people that we feel 
«t1! slick around- Of these, I think 20

Frat jumps 



By CHERYL MYERS 
Staff Writer 

In September, faced with the problem 
of what to do for nn encore following 
their convincing portrayal of Indians at 
an Old Fori skirmish in July, John 
Hoham and Don Gutfey convinced the 
other members of Sigma Phi Epsilon 
that an appropriate follow-up would be 
to jump out of an airplane. TTiemselv^s 
e:q«rienced jumpera, they were soon 
signing up members for Ihe four-hour 
parachute-jumping cour?e offered at 
Para Sport, in Tocsm, Indiana. 

Para Spori specialises in Ihe 
recreational aspects of skydiving. A 
small organization consisting of tv.v 
single-engine planes, as many pilots, 
and Tive or six instructors and jump 
masters, this group nex'crthelcsa is sn 
accredited jump school. Para Sport 
takes great pains lo insure the safety of 
its students, requiring aspiring jum- 
pers to attend a lengthy lecture, work in 
a paracjiute hamess-slmulalor, and 
practice PLF's (parachute landing 
falls) sweral lima before actually 
going up. 

Tie firsl jump land Ihe next five or 
ten. depending on the student's 
progress) la a static-line jump. In which 
Ihe chute Is opened automatically about 
six seconds after leaving the plane. The 
student Is in the air between three and 
five minutes before landing and is in 
contact, via a chest radio, with the 
ground crewdurlng Ihe en tire fall. 

An employe* of Para Sport, Jennie 
Bonbrake, said the worst Injuries 
usually seen are twisted or sprained 
ankles from failure to land pixipcrly. In 
her opinion, skydiving is no more 
dangerous than snow or water skiing. 
As for parachute malfunctions, Jump 
master Lance Anderson pointed out 
there Is a reserve chute m every pack 
which is seldom needed. 

"But when they are needed," added 
instructor Fred Schlmmel, "you'll 
think it's the most beautiful chute 
you've ever seen In your life." He went 
on lo say he's only used Ihe reserve 

On Ihe Saturday morning of the 
Sigma Phi Epsilon jump, three active 
members, two pledges, and two friends 
arrived at Para Sport to begin their 
Irainhig. Of Ihe seven, only pledge 
Charlie-Heili had any previous jumping 
experience and that was from his Army 
days. TTie other six — Steve Souers, 
Samlh Abouhalkah, Brent Adams, Joe 



Mothcrun^lt. \'ema Arnold and Stacey 
Sipcs — hadnever jumped before. 

Nevertheless. all successfully 
cumplcted their training before gelling 
out 11 tied In jumpsuits, helmets, 
goggles, chutes, and chest radios. 

Then line action Ijcgan. The pdot, 
Paul Ojchran. sal them three at a time 
on the floor of a compartmeDl about the 
site of the interior of an economy car. 
The jump master then ins true ted the 
first sludenl lo sit next to the hatch as 
he hooked up the line that triggered the 

Next, the pilot cut the engine and 
started to glide TTic hatch was opened 
tor the jumper to crawl out onto a bar 
beneath the wing, amid 60-mlIe-an-hour 
winds. At the jump master's signal, the 
student was to let go and begin his six- 
second free-fall, making sure to keep 
his back arched to avirid tumbling head 
over heels. 

All the participants jumped suc- 
ccs.sfully, and though admitting some 
nervoiBness before Ihe flight, all spolic 
well of the experience, 

"I like It," said Abouhalkah, "but the 
challenge Isklndoforer Tlie first jump 
is whether or not you can make your^f 
do it. From now on, it will be gaining 
skill to become better." 

Stacey SI pes was surprised by Ihe 
forceof the nind "\Vhen I got out there, 
it just dragged me away," he said. "I 
didn'l have time lo arch my back, so I 
had trouble getting balanced until the 
parachuteopened." 

"And you just have to w-onder, 'Is it 
going to open?', no matter how safe 
you're convinced jumping Is," added 
Joe Motherwell. 

Many member? stayed around for a 
second jump, despite Ihe cold, dreary 
weather. 

The owners of Para Sport encourage 
any and all lo come out and give 
skydiving a Iry. stressing that it is not 
as forbidding and difficult as it may 
seem. And the cost, after completing 
the training program, ' 



might b

SUBOG activities 



By JODIE Z 

Staff Wrller 

The Student Union Board of 
Governors (SUBOGi, the social and 
cultural arm of Students' Government 
currently has two of its H seats vacant. 
Ken Schenk, student body president, 
announced last week. 

SUBOG. one ol two branches of IP- 
FW' s Students' Government, has thus 
far sponsored an Hawaiian luau. an 

"Fame." "The Jerk" and "Shampoo" 
this semester. Further planned fall 
aclMlirs include hayrides, the annual 
Halloween costume dance, skntmg 
parlies and lectures by Paula Nelson 
and Tlie Great fCreskin, 

In Ihe spring, the group will host 
Harbor Arbor Days, a week-long 
festival with various activities. 

Many SUBOG activities are bee lo 
actiilty card holders lACH), while 
others are discounted sufcstanlially to 
those wi th a clivi ty cards . 

"Most students don't know that their 
l.D. card is Iheir activity card," said 
Corina Pena, SUBOG member. The 
activity-I.D. cards are iSstribuled the 
first few weeks of each semester and 
show the photograph of the holder. 

All students enrolled In nine or more 
credit hours are assessed a (20 acli vity- 
alhlelic fee. Proof of payment of the fee 
entitles students to Ihe activily card. 

U a studcat has no activity card but 
has paid the fee, tie or she may presail 
the pink fee receipt at a SUBOG ac- 
tivity and receive the same discount or 
those with activity 



Of the (20 assessed fee, 13,S5 goes lo 
SUBOC, The rest of the fee Is 
distributed among other campus 
organizations, including the athletic 
department (19) Purdue- Indiana 
Theatre ISI. HI and Ihe IPFW day care 
center HI. 181.

Terry Schuster, one of 
Ihe group's co-chairpersons. The other 
chairperson, Craig Baumgartner, said 
activities are chosen on the basis of 
sludenl input to SUBOG members. 

Although SUBOC traditionally 
chooses its members during the spring 
Students' Ckivemment election, the

petiUoning to Tdl empty SUBOC scats. 
That is. a student musi present a 
petition signed by 30 stixlcnls who ap-

member. 

Alter the petition Is presented, 
current SUBOG members check the 
petitioner's G.P.A. If it exceeds the 
rei^ired mimmum. Ihe seated mem-

petitioner as a member. 

Students wishing to serve on SUBOG 
can get petitions and other needed 
information about how to apply at the

members adrertise SUBOG events. 



PAGE 2 - THE COMMUNICATOR - OCTOBER 15. 1381 



Students talking; 
anyone listening? 



"The Scnale dug lis own grave by not 
Iblenrng lo the (iludenls. All or the 
posiljvc work Ihal we have done ia going 
lo be forgotlen now by Ihosc people thai 
did nol speak." said Ellen Engleman, 
student body vice-president, after lasi 
week's Senate meeting at which more 
than two dozen guests were denied 
speaking privileges when the Senate 
adjourned. 

The Communicalor couldn't agree 

For (he past few weeks, each time Ken 
Schenk and other members of iPFW's 
Students' Government were ashed why 
certain decisions had been made- 
Including the question of Ihc special 
dec lion decision— the main response 
has been thai no students had expressed 
themselves to members of that body in 
opposition to any of its decisions. 

As recently as last Tuesday. Schenk. 
student body president, was quoted as 
saying students should attend meetings 
of Ihe Senate and SUBOG and speak out 
on the Issues that concern them. 

Other Senate members, as well, have 
expressed the desire lo hear Ihe opinions 
of students and have urged allendnnce 
at Sonalc meetings. 

SUUOG members provided guests 
ample time to speak al their meeting 
Oct. 7. but. why. we ask, did the mem- 
bers of the Senate veto the motion made 
losuspcnd theSO-mlnute Senate meeting 
lime llmil? 

Do the senators believe that by 
keeping students' commenls out of of- 
Ficlal Senate minutes they can conlinue 
lo use the excuse that only a "couple of 
people" want the special election? 

Can Schenk still claim to be "willing lo 



hear both sides of the issue"? 

During the past week. Schenk has told 
The Communicator of plans lo create 
better communications with IPFW 
students. The plans include Students' 
Gnvernment informational forums, at 
which time the members o( that body 
will announce its plans and decisions, a 
Students' Government booth in Kelder 
Kali, to which students can go to give 
opinions, complaints and ideas; and a 
plan by which all students who want lo 
work on Senate matters can become 
executive assistants to Ihe group, with 
all senatorial rights exccpl Ihc rights to 
vole or Inlliate legislation. 

The Communicator Ihinks these plans 
are good ones and would, indeed, create 
bolter understanding between Students' 
Government members and Ihe students 
they represent. 

But, if last week's Senate meeting is 
an example of that body's desire lo 
communicate wilh students, we'll be 
surprised il new lines of communication 
are any more successful than the old. 

It's lime for Students' Government to 
reassess its priorities, especially if 
ending a Senate meeting on lime is more 
important than hearing what INVITED 
guests have come lo meetings to say 

It's not too late for the Senate to nil in 
its "grave" and get on a sound footing 
with Ihe students it represents. 

The Senate can do this by granting 
ALL who wish tospeak the lime in which 
to be heard— even if it means staying at 
a meeting longer than planned, or 
perhaps planning a longer meeting. 

Students want lo be heard, and we 
urge the Senate to listen

lo weed wilhoul a plasma 
unit nearby. 

By mid-July, as we hud- 
dled safe from musquiloes 
inside our home, we found 
growing weeds lo be a much 
simpler task than growing 
our vegetables. 



Further iroubles included 
a mole, who introduced us lo 
his version of plowing — 
sU-alghl through the sweet 
peas. When we asked a 
garden shop manager how lo 
convince Ihe mole lo leave, 
he suggested we use 
poisonnl bail. 

Naturally, we cnnged al 
such an unnatural remedy. 

A helpful neighbor then 
offered her homegrown 
remedy for moles, insisting 
all die while that she HATED 
la kill "one of God's tilde 
crea lures."

We, however. used

The fmal assault on our 
garden came in August.

Head-hunting astounds senator 



To the editor 

Despite my 19 years ex- 
perience with the workings 
dI the human mind, 1 am 
occasionally still astounded 




lolt, such lota] 
such Ill-founded

present barrage of letlcrs 
regarding an alleged 
"proposed activity tec in-

"Why arc they promoting 
a mandatory activity fee for 
part-lime students? " asks 
Thomas McLaughlin. My 
queslion: "Who is promoting

Surely not Ihe prfseni

even debated the Idea.

proles tors are "lired of 
having an activity lee raised

scapegoat, the only groups to 
fit Ihal bill are Ihe Indiana 
and Purdue Boards ol 
Trustees, the "un elected 
bodies" who have final say 
on mailers such as activity 

Another irony surrounding 
Ibe activity fee is the nodon 
that Students' Government 
is gelling all or mo«l of II la 
spend as they see fit Ion 
dances, concerts, movies 
and the like). Aclually. a per 
capita breakdown shows that 
nine of the $20 goes lo die 
athletic department, while 
only $3.B6 goes to the Student 
Government account (and 
11.33 of this is for The

Finally, let me address die 



recent complaints regarding 
acLvilies Uiat SUBOG

time for someone lo stand up 
for the desires of full-lime, 
"traditional" students who 
do have a social life and do 
live for Uiings other than 

I often hear it quoted thai 
die average student here is 
27 years old, hut this is like 
saying that the average

Obviously, there are older 
students here ( many of 
whom are part-time and do 
nol pay an actlvily fee), but 

penence than simply Ihe 

One of the problems of a 
commuter campus is trying 
lo gel students Involved in

probably for their own good 
reasons, il certainly does not 
mean that ihcy should tie

imagination. 

Lack of Imagination is Ihe 
main probiem of "Laugh." 
Like "Song," th»re l! a T.V.

her to star in a play he's 
written about their 
relalionship 

Mind you, all this happ&gt;?ns 
In one day. During the rest of 
the nim, Georgia goes back 
on the booie and gets beaten 
up, and her daughler runs 
away and gets drunk. 

Simon's ioipl stranfb 
good performers «ho try but 
can't rise above Ihc film's 
emotionally bankrupt Lone 
Mor^a Mason can be a fine 
actress but, unfortunalely, 
appears most of Ihc lime in 
her husband's films. AU the 
force of her character comes 
oul of her, not out of the 
character. En fad. Georgia Is 



full of 

pity, and is nt cardboard, it 
is 3 wonder a talented ac- 
tress like Mason accepted 
the rule in the fir^l place 

Krisly McNichol is another 
lalcnted performer who gets 
bogged dou-n in (his slop. Stic

"Only When I Laugh" is a

prevalent in Hollywood. It Is 
made by people who think

The film also show 
Neil Simon is loo prolific (or 
lus own good. His last ibd 
films, "Chapter Two" and 
"Seems Like Old Times,"

office. Ttiis should (eil him to 
slow down. He can be 3 good 
writer, as "(Goodbye Girl," 
"Odd Couple" and "Barefoot

latest films have been 
examples ol Simon's menial 
masturbation

Embassy crowd loves play 



8r MIKE CiEFFEN 

An en)oysblc production o( 
Nell Simon's lalcel Broad- 
way hit "They're Playing 
Our Song" waa offered at (be 
Embassy Theafe Oc( 7, and 
the enthuslnnllc crovtd who 
nUed Ihc theatre obviously 
loved it. 

The play proved that Neil 
Simon hasn't lost his touch 
for writing snappy one 
liners. Although most of his 
rcccnl plays and films, lack 
character development, 
"Song," had enough omus- 
ing mqmenis lo make 11 
guccced as an entertaining, 
llghlvi'clght piece of fiuK. 

The plot Is basically a 
' ' — boy songwrltc" 



back together. Simon never 
gets past the sUcom level of 
this plot but mokes up (or it 
becaific his lines have a 
certain amount of charm. 

The music adds to the 
charm ol the play, and 
smoolhs over the spots 
where the triteness of 
Simon's script is apparent. 
The score, by Marvin 
Hamllsch and Carole Bayer 
Sager. is pleasant and 
contains some of (heir best 
worklodole, 



"Fill in the Words." 

The cast made the most of 
these numbers and had fun 
with the willy lines of ihe 
script. June Gable, as Sonla 
Wabk, clearly had the 
stronger role, and she had 
the most (un with her port. 

Though her timing seemed 
slightly off, probably due to 
rushed direction, she had a 
good voice and great natural 
charm Sheseemcd" ''"

WHAT COULD 

THE ARMY 

POSSIBLY OFFER 

A BRIGHT PERSON 



Drop your guard for a 
minute. Even though you're 
in college right now, there 
are many aspects of the Army 
that you might find very 
attractive. 

Maybe even irresistible. 
See for yourself, 

MEDSCHOOUONUS 

You read it right 

The Army's Health Professions Scholarship 
Program provides necessary tuition, books, lab 
fees, even microscope rental during medical 
school. 

Plus a monthly stipend that works out to 
about $6,000 a year 

After you're accepted into medical 
school, you can be accepted into our program. 
Then you're commissioned and you go 
through school as a Second Lieutenant in the 
Army Reserve. 

The hitch? Very simple. After you graduate. 
you give the Army a year as a doctor for every 
year the Army gave you as a med student, with 
a minimum obligation of three years* service. 

IKIHIMSHIRRESIDEMCY 
&amp; CASH BONUSES 

Besides scholarships to medical school, the 
Army also offers AMA-approved first-year 
post-graduate and residency training programs. 

Such training adds no further obligation to 
the scholarship participant But any Civilian 
Graduate Medical Education sponsored by the 
Army gives you a one-year obligation for 
every year of sponsorship, with a minimum 
obligation of two years' service 

But you get a $9,000 annual bonus every 
year you're paying back medical school or post- 
graduate rrainmg. 

So you not only get your medical education 
paid for, you get extra pay while you're paying 
it back. Not a bad deal 

A GREAT PLACE TO BE A NURSE 

The rich tradition of Army Nursing is one 
of excellence, dedication, even heroism. And 
it's a challenge to live up to. 

Today, an Army Nurse is the epitome of 
professionalism, regarded as a critical member 
of the Army Medical Team 

A BSN degree is required. And the clinical 
spectrum is almost impossible to match in 
civilian practice. 

And, since you'll be an Army Officer, you'll 
enjoy more respect and authonty than most of 
your civilian counterparts. You'll also enjoy 
travel opportunities, officer's pay and officer's 
privileges. 

Army Nursing offers educational oppor- 
tunities that are second to none As an Army 
Nurse, you could be selected for graduate degree 
programs at civilian universities. 



UKEYOU? 



ADVANCED NURSING COURSE, 
TUmON-FREE 

You get tuition, pay and li\'ing allowances. 
You can also take Nurse Practitioner courses 
and courses in many clinical specialities. All on 
the Army- 
While these programs do not cost you any 
money, most of them do incur an additional 
service obligation. 

A CHANCE TO PRACTICE LAW 

If you re about to get your law degree and 
be admitted to the bar, you should consider a 
commission in the Judge Advocate General 
Corps. Because in the Army you get to practice 
law right from the start 

While your classmates are still doing other 
lau'yers' research and other la\\7ers' briefs, you 
could have your own cases, your own clients, 
in effect, your own practice. 

Plus you'll have the pay, prestige and privi- 
leges of being an Officer in the United States 
Army. With a chance to travel and make the 
most of what you've worked so hard to 
become A real, practicing Iau7er Be an Army 
Lauder 

ROTC SCHOLARSHIPS 

Though you re too late for a 4-year 
scholarship, there are 3-, 2-, and even l-year 
scholarships available. 

They include tuition, books, and lab fees. 
Plus S 100 a month living allowance. Naturally 
they're very competiti\'e. Because 
besides helping you towards your 
degree, an ROTC scholarship helps 
you towards the gold bars of an 
Army Officer 

Stop by the ROTC office on 
campus and ask about details. 



UPTOS170AM0NTH 

You can combine 5er\-ice in the 
Army Reser\'e or National Guard 
with Army ROTC and get between 
S7,000 and $14,000 while you're 
still in school 

It's called the Simultaneous 
Membership Program. You get $100 
a month as an Advanced Army ROTC 
Cadet and an additional S70 a month 
(sergeant's pay ) as an Army Reservist, 

When you graduate, you'll be 
commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. 



but not necessarily 
assigned to active duty Find 
out about it 

A BONUS FOR 
PART-TIME WORK 

You can get a $1,500 
bonus just for enlisting in some Army Reserve 
units. Or up to $4,000 in educational benefits. 
You also get paid for your Reserve duty It 
comes out to about $1,100 a year for one weekend 
a month and two weeks annual training 

And now we have a special program to help 
you fit the Army Reserve around your school 
schedule- 
It's worth a look- 

A SECOND CHANCE AT COLLEGE 

Some may find college to be the right place 
at the wrong time for a variety of reasons. The 
Army can help them, too, 

A few years in the Army can help them get 
money for tuition and the maturity to use it 
wisely. 

The Army has a program in which money 
saved for college is matched two-for-one by the 
government- Then, if one qualifies, a generous 
bonus is added to that. 

So 2 years of service can get you up to 
$15,200 for college. 3 and 4 years up to $20,100. 
In addition, bonuses up to $5,000 are available 
for 4-year enlistments in selected skills. 

Add in the experience and maturity gained. 
and the Army can send an individual back to 
college a richer person in more ways than one. 

We hope these Army opportunities have 
intrigued you as well as surprised you. Because 
there is indeed a lot the Army can offer a bright 
person like you-

The Michigon Department 
of Natural Resources plants 
salmon in some streams 
where conditions are not 
favorable for salmon 
reproduction, A river must 
have a gravel bed like Pere 
Marquette's in order for 
eg^ lo hatch, because 
salmon cannot hatch in a 
river with a sand bed. Wing 

Salmon, whether bom 
naturally or planted in 
slreams, will head out Into 
L^ke Michigan and return to 
Ihalsame.slrcam within two 
10 three years, he said. In 
streams where salmon can 
reproduce naturally, a male 
will look for female whose 
cg^ he can fertilise, and the 
two will head upstream. 

The female will thenspola 
place 10 spawn If she is not 
caught. The male, done 
fertilizing her eggs, will join 
her to die and decompose 
afterwards. Wing said. 

In streams where salmon 
cannot reproduce naturally, 
hatcheries are located where 
mate and female salmon 
swim into holding ponds. 
Workers then strip Ihe eggs 
from the female and the 
male's sperm for fer-

when they are tliree to four 
inches long, arc planted in

spring to start the salmon 
cycle all over agam. Wing
