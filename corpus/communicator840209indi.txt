Coach's decision 



Baakelball. like most aports, Is a fast- 
paced game. In the heal of tite baltle, 
lempere may flair and things may Re! 
out of hand. 

On Feb. 2 in Kenosha, Wis., things 
evidently got out of hand for IPFW 
men's basketball coach Tim Russell. 
Russell was called for three technical 
fouls in the Mastodons game against 
Wiaconsin-Parkside. AJIer the third 
technical, Russell took his team off the 
floor and forfeited the game. ■ 

When their teams are playing 
lethargic, coaches and managers often 
gel in arguments with officials It's a 
ploy to pump life into the learn. 
Sometimes It does work, as so often 
happened with Ihe Baltimore Orioles 
after an Earl Weaver tantrum. 
Someiimes It doesn't work, as was (he 
case Feb, 2, 

Russell said he look the learn off the 
floor to protect the players. Three 
players had already left the game with 
injuries and he didn'I want any more. 

Forfeiling a game isn't saving the 



players from possible injury, it's saving 
the players and school from em- 
barrassment. Hopefully Ibis incident 
won't damage the school's reputation as 
an up and coming competitive program. 

Several opposing coaches have in- 
dicated that this year's team is the best 
learn they've ever seen here. And why 
not? Russell has put together a good 
balance of speed, quickness, height and 
shooting ability to play a competitive 
NCAA Division 11 schedule. 

The trouble is, several possible future 
opponents who might add credibility to 
Ihe program may shy away from 
playing IPFW for fcaror another lemper 
lanlrum by Russell and subsequent 

Basketball can be an enjoyable game 
lo play and watch. The players put in loo 
many long hours of practice and travel 
(o lose games this way. The fans D?FW 
has accrued throughout Ihe season may 
slop coming out to the games after this 
incident. Hopefully they won't, but we 
wouldn't blame them if they do.
