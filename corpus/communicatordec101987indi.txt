A Moslem's viewpoint on life 



The celebration of Christmas is, of 
course, a celebration of religion. II 
can be argued that Americans have an 
increased awareness of Christianily al 
this time of the year. 

Considering this, it seems an op- 
portune time to learn about faiths that 
we in our geographical limitalions 
rarely contact. Therefore, we al The 
Communicator are presenting the fol- 
lowing article on a faith that is im- 
pressive both in the events that seem 
to surround it and Ihe sheer numbers 
of its following. 

Islam is found throughout Ihe world. 
11, like Judaism and Christianity, is a 
religion (hat believes in one god only. 
In Arabic. His name is Allah, from 
which is derived a popular Arabic 
phrase "inshallah" or "if God wills 
it," 

The followers of Islam are known as 
Moslems, Moslems use the Arabic 

language, whose different alphabet 
explains the many spelling variations 
in English books. 

The principal text in which the ma- 
jor beliefs of Islam can be found is in 
the Holy Qu'ran lor Koran). The 
Qu'ran was given lo the prophet 
Mohammed by Allah through the an- 
gel Gabriel, The Moslems believe thai 
if they faiUifully follow the Qu'ran's 
teachings that the believer will enter 
Heaven These require the Moslem to 
place God as the highest priority, 
hence the name islam, which literally 
means "submission." 

There are many Moslems attending 

classes here at IPFW, Shabbir 
Morriswalla, an American Moslem, 
elatxirale on the religion in an 
interview conducted last week. 



"Islam," he said, "is a very beauti- 
ful religion." Because moslems be- 
lieve in only one god. just as Jews and 

Ctirislians, some read the holy txwks 
of these religions as well. Even so. the 
Qu'ran is the most important work lo 
the follower of Islam. As Morriswalla 
puts it. "The Qu'ran is not just a book, 
it IS a way of life." 

Morriswalla explained that the 
Moslem must follow the laws of the 
Qu'ran as well as others, such as the 
ten commandments of Moses, In 



Islam, however, the laws are far more 
numerous, specific, and relevant lo 
everyday living. This is demonstrated 
in the Five Pillars of Islam, with 
which all muslims should comply. 
The Five Pillars are: 

1) The Moslem must say the creed 
of faith found in the Qu'ran ("There is 
only one true God, and Mohammed is 
his prophet") 

2) He should also pray to God five 
times daily. This is done facing to- 
wards the sacred Islamic stone known 
as the Holy Kabba, located in Mecca, 
Saudi Arabia This is believed to have 
been built by Abraham and his son, 
IshmacI 

3) A Moslem should donate a per- 
cenlage of his not assets towards 
helping the poor 

4 ) 'The believer fasts during 
Ramazan 'one of the Islamic months). 

51 One must make a pilgrimage to 
Mecca This applies only to those 
physically or financially able to do so. 



For the Christian, Chrislmas and 
Easter can be seen as the most im- 
portant days, but for the Moslem, 
"everyday is (the most important 
day)." 

That is not lo say that Islam has no 
traditions. Morriswalla said one of the 
most joyful occasions is the 
Eid-ul-Azha, which is celebrated the 
first day after the pilgrimage Another 
is Eid-ul-Fitr which Is held on the first 
day after Ramaisan. 

Just as Cll 
applications and recom- 
mend three lo five appli- 
cants lo the Governor for 
final consideration. The 
Governor makes the actual 
apfwintment. 

Applications are available 
a I the student government 
offices at each of the 60-plus 
academic institutions of 
higher learning in the stale 
or from SSACl, 964 North 



Pennsylvania Street, In- 
dianapolis, Indiana 46204- 
10B8 (telephone: 

317/232-2350). 

To be considered, appli- 
cations must be postmarked 
on or l&gt;efore Thursday, Jan. 
21, 1988. Students must be 
attending one of Indiana's 
academic institutions of 
higher learning and must l&gt;e 
willing to commit to partic- 
ipating in six commission 
meetings a year. 

The person eventually 
appointed by Governor Orr 
will serve a two-year term. 
The position carries no sal- 
ary, but members are en- 
titled lo per diem allow- 
ances and mileage reim- 
bursement lo cover their 
expenses. After the 
Thursday, Jan. 21 applica- 
tion deadline, ihe nominat- 
ing committee will narrow 
the list of applicants to a 
group to be personally in- 
terviewed by the committee 
and then will decide which 



students to recommend for 
the Governor's 

consideration.

Consultant contracted to correct campus color complexities 



Editor's Note: Recently, 
IPFW received a grant to 
study the issue of school 
colors, and used the money 
to hire a world- re k now ned 
Color Consultant What fol- 
lows is an interview of 
which Professor Michael 
Downs (political science) 
and Professor Arthur 
Friedel (chemistryi dis- 
cussed the front-running 
color combinalinn?: 

Commentary 

CC: Color is an ex- 
tremely important issue in 
[he modern world— one 
which determines context, 
mood, and image. ..not to 
mention my profession and 
income. Which colors one 
chooses for ones' school 
may have an impact on 
generations to come— their 
moods as students, their 
academic performance, 
their school loyalty, and so 
forth. Each of us is deeply 
affected by colors. You, 



Professor Friedel, you fa- 
vor red and gold— autumn 
colors-for IPFW, What 
were your high school 
colors? 

AP: Ah, high school. 
What a long time ago. Our 
colors were. uh. red and 
gold, but that has nothing lo 
do with it. I just think we 
should build on the little bit 
of tradition we have, rather 
than changing colors after 
so many years of red and 
gold. 

CC: And your high school 
colors. Professor Downs? 

MD: I think that gold is 
old and red is dead. 

CC: Thank you for your 
slogans. CouJd you just an- 
swer the question? 

MD: Okay, blue and 
white were my high school 
colore, but that has nothing 
at all to do with my choices 
for IPFW. It's pure coin- 
cidence. I think blue and 
white form the wave of the 
future. 

CC: Thank you tor the 
pun. Could you elaborate? 



MD: Well, 1 want us lo 
have colors we can wear. 
Anywhere Wear where? 
Everywhere. Whene'er, ,. 

CC: Wherey clever. I 
mean, very wever. Judging 
from the way you are both 
dressed, neither of you has 
Iraught new clothes since 
19S9 Am I correct in as- 
suming that's when you 
graduated from high 
school? I No response &gt; 
Anyhow, why do you favor 
these colors? 

MD: I chose my high 
school because it had blue 
and white, I have always 
loved those colors. They're 
the color of Mary. 

CC: Please, this is a pub- 
lic institution. 

MD: My wife is named 
Mary. And there's the St 
Mary's River and Mary 
Christmas, 1 would make 
everything blue and while it 
I could. When 1 rule the 
world, I WILL make every- 
thing blue and while, I.,, 

CC: You are turning 
rather blue, yourself, Pro- 



Women involved in business 



One of the best things a 
female student at IPFW can 
do is get involved with the 
Women's Bureau, 

Commentary 

On Monday, Nov. 16, 1987, 
the Bureau had a seminar 
on "Women in Business." 
The two speakers, Ricky 
Goldstein and Jill Palajac, 
talked for over an hour on 
some of the options avail- 
able lo today's women. 

Jill Palajac is a nurse- 
practitioner ^t Planned 
Parenthood, located at 303 
W. Berry, the Medical 
Building, 

Jill gave an in-depth 
synopsis of the changing 
role of nursing, going from 



women to change the 
stereotype nursing has had 
and make it a desirable ca- 
reer tor the future, 

Jill also told about the 
many services ottered by 
Planned Parenthood: birth 
control advice, physicals 
and testings, most of which 
are free or pro-raled lo 
meet lower incomes, 

Ricky Goldstein is a di- 
rector ol counseling at the 
Women's Bureau, which is 
in the Central Building at 
203 W, Wayne St, She em- 
phasized at one time "the 
importance of a degree in a 
world of credentials. It's not 
what you know that is 
necessarily important; do 
you have a degree to prove 
you know it?" 

Mrs, Goldstein also used 



the meeting as an op- 
portunity lo promote the 
Women's Bureau. As a 
counselor at the bureau, 
Ricky has helped families, 
teenagers, and especially 
women on any numtwr of 
problems, 11 seems the 
Women's Bureau, which is 
a not-for-protit organiza- 
tion, is a place (hat actually 
has answers lo a tot of 
problems, and if Ihey don't. 
they help you find them in- 
stead of letting you go on 
your own. 

Like Planned Parenthood, 
ser^'ices are charged ac- 
cording to income. For 
more information on either 
place, go to IPFW's branch 
ol the Women's Bureau, lo- 
cated in the Walb Union 
Building G25 



fessor Downs. Won't you 
please calm down. 

AP: It's just that we both 
have such strong feelings on 
Ihis important issue. 

CC: Yes. I know, 11 all 
goes lo prove jusl how im- 
portant colors are, and why 
each of us should have a 
personal color consultant, 
Bui back lo IPFW's colors. 
Somebody recently suggest- 
ed that each new chancel- 
lor should gel to adopt new 
colors, like they do new 
stationery and new logos 
and new cars and new in- 
terpretalions of thousands 
of university policies Don't 
you think Ihat's a good 

AF: We'd be changing 
every tew months. 

MD: The budget couldn't 
lake the shock, 1 mean, 
we'd have to put all new 
athletic uniforms and new 
campus signage and new 
publicationagc and what- 
everelsage and everything. 
No, that's no answer lo the 
problem, 

CC: It's nice lo see you 
both agree on something. 
Still, there are some finan- 
cial arguments, aren't 
there? 

MD: Yes, and Ihey favor 
blue and white. To print in 
blue and white, you have lo 
use only one color of ink 



and white paper, which is 
cheap. To print in red and 
gold takes either colored 
paper or two colors of ink 

AP: But we already 
have lots of things in red 
and gold, 1 went lo a vol- 
leyball game the other 
night, and it was very weird 
to sec our blue-and-while- 
clad players looking like the 
visiting team in Iheir own 
gym. Can you imagine what 
it would cost lo redo the 
whole Multipurpose Thingie 
or whatever Dr, Becring 
wants us to call the gym' 
Or to do the War Memorial 
Coliseum up in blue and 
white tor Commencement? 
Blue carpel. Blue flowers. 
White banners,,, 

MD: But we've changed 
the whole academic struc- 
ture, anyhow. We need new 
banners and new deans, and 
the flowers are new every 
year too, 

CC: Could I,.. 

MD: And we don't want 
the War Memorial Coliseum 
to look like what Bill 
Frederick called a "cheap 
funeral " 

AF: Nobody ever said 
that about the University of 
Southern California's 
ceremonies, or the funeral 
parades of tlie Roman Em- 
pire. Gold ain't cheap. Be- 
sides, red and gold mark 



our affiliations with two 
once-great slate 

universities. 

CC; Uh... 

AF: Jusl because Dr, 
Wallace had blue and white 
at Old Dominion doesn't 
mean we should have those 
colors here, 

MD: He had a dilfercnl 
shade of blue, as he has 
deadpannedly and repeat- 
edly assured the Faculty 
Senate, And tor all i know, 
a different shade of while, 
too. You're not going to ebb 
the ground swell of en- 
thusiasm for blue and white 
just by attaching them to 



this particular chancellor, 
you rcd-and-gold bas... 

CC: Gentlemen Could 
we... 

AF: And red has taken on 
a new, positive connotation 
thanks to Glasnosl 

MD: It just reminds me 
of the federal deficit, or 
Ronald Reagan's 

cheekbones. 

CC: Would either of you 
feel compelled to leave the 
institution were the other 
side lo win Ihe color 
argument? 

MD: As long as t don't 
have lo pay all of my park- 
ing fines, I'll be here. 



Otherwise, they'll Just seize 
my final paycheck to pay 
them oft 

AF: I've l&gt;een here (oj- 
twenty years— as long as 
red and gold-and I'll stay 
until the last twautiful au- 
tumn day brings the last 
red and gold leaves, or until 
TIAA/CREF lets me retire 
comfortably. Whichever 
comes first. 

CC: I think...

Miss Basketball at IPFW 



As Hoosier Hysteria runs 
rampant in Indiana, it's not 
uncommon to find residents 
who eai, sleep and drink 
basketball. Teri RoslnskI is 
a prime example, 

"Basketball is not just a 
hobby for me, it's a ca- 
reer," she said. 

Rosinski, entering her 
Ursl season as the Mas- 
todons' women's coach, 
begins her collegiate career 
with a young but eager 
team that has four soph- 
omores and six freshmen. 

"My goal is to make 
everyone hate to play us." 
she said. "We'll surprise 
some people." 

After finishing with a 4-23 
mark last season, Rosinski 
has the same rebuilding 
challenge ahead that she 
faced at Bishop Luers High 
School. Lasl year, her first 
and only as Luers' head 
coach, she turned a ft-il ball 
club into a winner in 1387, 



finishing at 14-6. The move, 
however, arrived swiner 
than expected, 

■"I enjoyed coaching at 
Luers, IPFW was the only 
job that could take me 
away from Luers." she 
Said. "It happened llhe 
move to IPFWl more 
quickly than anticipated," 

Before taking the head 
coaching job at Luers. 
Rosinski served as an as- 
sistant coach at Homestead 
High School. Prior lo 
coaching, she made a name 
for herself as a player. 

In 19T7, she led Norwell 
High School to the slate fi- 
nal tour. She was named 
Miss Basketball that sea- 
son, averaging 25.1 points 
per game. After playing 
briefly two seasons at Il- 
linois State, Rosinski trans- 
ferred to Indiana University 
where she completed her 
education. Her playing days 
were cut short due to nag- 
ging knee injuries. 

As a coach, Rosinski is a 
strict believer in never'Say- 
die hard work. She always 



expects 100% from her 
players 

"I expect them lo be the 
best they can be," she said. 
"You'll be successful if 
you've given everything you 
had and youve prepared 
the best you could." 

During the pre-season, 
Rosinski illustrated to her 
players jusi how strongly 
she expects all-out hustle 
In the past two months, she 
initiated a rigorous condi- 
tioning program, eomplele 
with scrimmages, weight 
training, and three half- 
mile runs six days a week. 
The players run both wind 
sprinU) and long distances 
After lasl season's losing 
record, Rosinski wants a 
winning season for more 
Ihan personal satisfaction. 

"We need lo he a winner 
lo bring in more players," 
she said "We need to cre- 
ate a greater impact here 
at IPFW and in Fort 
Wayne, We need to be suc- 
cessful to do that."

response, from the faculty, 
students and staff of Ihe 
University. They followed 
us very closely and that 
was also very exciting for 
us Their response is a real 
tribute to our kids and the 
direction of our athletic 
program. It has been taking 
real positive steps." 

A panel of coaches, 
sporlswrilcrs and other 
media personnel voted for 
an all-regional team for the 
tournament. Senior setter 
Judy Yagodinski was 
named to the squad. 

Ball talked about this 
years team. 'Judy 
&lt; Yagodinski ) stands oul 
because she made the all 
tourney team and was the 
conference MVP the last 
two years but it was really 
a team effort throughout 
the year." 

"The tourney was really 
good for our program," said 
Ball. "We made some in- 
roads and showed Ihose 
people we could play at that 
level We had played some 
of Ihe teams in the regular 
season but never at the 
tourney level." 

"We could have gotten 
blown oul but we didn't. We 
proved ourselves. It is a 
major fear of a coach to go 
into a tourney like this and 
fall flat on our face, but il 
didn't happen and that was 
a real positive experience." 

The 19B7 Volleydons fin- 
ished the season wilh a re- 
cord of 32 and 7. Graduating 
memtwrs of the team are

To 1)0 chosen Ihe best in 
your field is an honor thai 
anyone can be proud of, 
but to be chosen twice is 
quite an accomplishment. 

This is exactly what 
iPFW Volleydons team 
member Judy Yagodinski 
has done, winning Ihe 
Great Lakes Valley Con- 
ference M\'P. or as it is 
called, the Paragon 
Award, two years in 
succession, 

"I was really sur- 
prised." Yagodinski said. 
"I didn't think' I would get 
il after winning it last

thii 



Yagodinski was thinking 
about going into this 
year's volleyball season. 

"1 knew it was my sen- 
ior year. All I wanted to 
do was play hard and have 
a really good year. It (Ihe 
award) never entered my 
mind," she said. 

'Tm grateful I received 
it," she added, 

Yagodinski's interest in 
volleyball starled in grade 
school. "I played in sixth 
grade in Ihe Catholic 
Youth Organization at the 
old Central Catholic 
gym." 

Judy wasn't always Ihe 
star of the team, like when 
she went out for the vol- 
leyball team at New 
Haven High School as a 
freshman, but didn't be- 
come a regular until her 
senior year. That year, 
New Haven had one of 
their best teams ever, 
wilh a 19-6 record, and 
Yagodinski was voted the 
most improved player by 
her teammates 

Yagodinski had no plans 
to play collegiate vol- 
leyball. She just wanted lo 



attend a college that was 
close to home That school 
was IPFW But Coach 
Arnie Bail sent Ihe t9a2 
New Haven graduate a 
letter saying he was in- 
terested in having her as a 
member of his Volleydon 

"I got the chance lo play 
and lo go lo school, too," 
she said. ''And Coach Ball 
taught me a lot about Ihe 
game." 

An ankle injury forced 
Ball to red-shirt Judy dur- 
ing her freshman year, 
and she played very little 
her sophomore year. As a 
junior, she received her 
chance to start. She re- 
tained thai starting spot 
for the next three years 
and was named all- 
conference each of those 

Coach Ball talked about 
Ihe I wo- time conference 
MVP: "All coaches dream 
of having a player like 
Judy. She is a great ex- 
ample of an overachiever. 
She works very hard 
mentally and physically lo 
be Ihe best she can be and 
constamly gives herself 
tor the good of the pro- 
gram. There is nothing 
more a coach can ask for 
than that Judy follows a 
very rich tradition of set- 
ters since I have been 
here (at IPFW)," 

Yagodinski's major is 
nursing and she is cur- 
rently working al Park- 
view Hospital, but she still 
plans to keep playing 
volleyball. 

"The seniors on this 
year's team are planning 
on playing in tourneys 
around the slate. We plan 
to stick together." 

About the future: "I 
would love to coach var- 
sity at the high school 
level "
