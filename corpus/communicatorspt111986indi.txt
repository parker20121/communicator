Lantz fills vacancy with exuberance 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 

Editor-in-Chief 

"I can't imagine doing anything in 

life except working with students," said 

Joanne B. Lantz, Monday. 

Such enthusiasm for education and 
an interest in child development have 
led Lantz from the halls ol Areola High 
School to the office of assistant vice 
chancellor and dean of academic 
services at IPFW. 

Lantz, who's been at IPFW for 21 
years, was appointed to the latter 
position over the summer, filling a 
vacancy left when O. Franklin Ken- 
worthy left IPFW to take a position at 
St. Louis University, 

Lantz, a native of Defiance, said her 
position is one where she oversees 
several university functions. "I'm the 
clearing house lor all (Indiana 
University and Purdue University) new 
courses at this campus," said Lantz. In 
addition, she supervises enrollment 
management, IPFW missions, 
registration, financial aid, student 
academic counseling and career, 
testing and placement. 

"My responsibility,.! hope, is to make 
it tall the duties just named) an in- 
tegral part of the university, to make 
them effective departments that do the 
job they're supposed to be doing," she 
said. 

"The job they're supposed to be 
doing" is serving the students and 
doing what is best for students, ac- 
cording to Lantz. "We have to figure 
out the best way to meet the needs of 
our students," she said. "That is the 
guiding principle. Without all cf you 
llhe students), we (teachers) don't 



Being in education for over 35 years 
has seemingly emblazoned that 
philosophy upon Lantz's mind. She 
began leaching in 1953 as a physics and 
mathematics teacher at Areola High 
School. From there she moved to New 
Haven Senior High School where she 
served as guidance director. In 1965, 
(our years before completing a Ph.D. in 
counseling-psychology, Lantz joined 
IPFW as an assistant professor of 
psychological sciences and coordinalor 
of academic advising. From 1968 to 
present day. Lanti lias held an 
assundry of positions: director of 
counseling and testing, assistant dean 
for student services, associate 
professor of psychological sciences and 
chairperson of the department of 
psychological sciences. She held the 
latter position since 19B2. Lantz is also 
assistant dean of the Purdue University 
graduate school. She serves on Pur- 
due's graduate council. 

She said one of the best things about 
working at IPFW was the dedicated 
faculty leaching here, "The greatest 
thing we have is a terrific faculty," she 
said. "That is the bottom line " Lantz 
said she occasionally finds herself 
being accused of being a pollynnna, a 
person who finds good in everything. 
But she does not care; she loves 
change, and thinks change usually 
brings improvement For example, the 
reorganization plan underway for 
IPFW, (where the campus will be 
divided into schools of a certain 
discipline instead of having several 
departments), is bound to bring 
feelings of fear and apprehension to

many faculty members at IPFW. 
However, said LanU. the 
reorganization plan has a great 
potential for streamlining scheduling 
for students and for making IPFW 
more economically efficient overall. 
In the end, said Lantz. the IPFW 
faculty generally work together to gel 
somelhing done. "In 21 years, I've not 
seen people Inoti work hard lo get 
where we need lo be," she said. 

A pollyanna you say? Lantz proudly 
agrees, with a smile of course. 



Forensic 
launches 
new year 
of contests 



By LILLIAN R. LYON 
Managing Editor 

Making speeches is something most 
students hate to do. But not the IPFW 
forensics team. 

The forensics team, which has about 
nine members, travels every weekend 
from October to April. Student com- 
petitors can go on just one road Irip or 
all of them, and can take part in many 
different areas of competilioa 

The IPFW team competes mainly 

in public speaking and oral in- 
lerpretalion. Public speaking includes 
impromptu, persuasive, informative, 
extemporaneous, rhetorical criticism, 
and after-dinner. The category of oral 
interpretation consists of prose, poetry, 
dramatic interpretation, and dramatic 

The team meels Wednesdays at 2:30 
p.m. in Neff Hall room 380, and 
members practice to suit their 

schedules . 

Officers for this year are: president, 
Gine Kostoff, vice president, John 
Brouwer; and public relations 
historians, Stacey Schaab and Dawn 
Sewell. 

This past spring, six members of the 
team were initiated inlo Delta Sigma 
Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha, a national 
forensics fraternity, which is new to 
IPFW. 

Also new to IPFW is the forensics 
coach, Bruce Wickelgrin, This is his 
first year at IPFW. coming from 
Wayne State University in Detroit. 
Mich., where he was on the faculty and 
team coach. Before Wayne State, 
Wickelgrin attended Mancato State 
University in Minnesota, where, as a 
graduate student, he was assistant 
director then acting director of their 
forensics team. He holds a bachelor's 
and a master's degree in speech 
communication from Mancato. 

Wickelgrin encourages all students to 
participate on the team. The benefits 
include travel and the chance lo im- 
prove one's speaking ability. "It's one 
of the best ways to hone skills," 
Wickelgrin savs. 

Last year, IPFW took ninth place in 
national competition al Bloonutburg, 
Perm , and first place in the Indiana 
Stale tournament, which was held at St. 
Marys of the Wood College in Terre

Fine arts students face 
parking problems, too 



How would you fee! if you had to 
purchase a campus parking permit but 
rarely had the chance to use it? 

We are not referring to part-time 
students. We are talking about fine arts 
students who pay the parking fee, use it 
for a class or two here but have no use 
for it downtown when attending classes 
there. No matter if the student is taking 
one class here and four downtown, they 
must still pay a $5 parking fee. 

Most fine arts students park along the 
street in what is primarily a residential 
area. Because it is a residential area, 
many homeowners park along Berry 
Street also. This leaves less room for 
students. There are no downtown 
parking lots owned by IPFW for students 
using their permits. 

This is not an issue of paying an 
unncessary fee. It is an issue concerning 
space availability. Students formerly 
could park in a vacant lot near the fine 
arts buildings but the lot they used has 
been sold recently, and become 
overgrown with weeds and is now 
unuseable. 

This leaves few alternatives for 
students. They could park at the meters 
in downtown Fort Wayne and walk to 
their classes, eliminating a need for 
parking permits. Students may also 
park at IPFW's main campus and 
commute via the P.T.C. buses. Again, 
they would be spending additional 



money when costs should be covered by 
the university permits. 

Students are stuck in a no-win 
situation. To park at IPFW, they need a 
parking permit. But in attending classes 
downtown, they are left holding a useless 
piece of plastic. 

The solution is not a simple one. 
Funding for a new fine arts facility is 
being sought and any long-term action 
for parking at the Berry Street campus 
is a needless expense. 

However, short-term action can be 
taken. Perhaps the university should 
negotiate with the city in providing 
parking space. Either a contract 
allowing students with permits to park 
at certain meters at certain times 
without having to stuff dimes in the 
meter every hour, or the use of a nearby 
parking lot, perhaps through a private 
organization such as St. Joseph Medical 
Center or the Scottish Rite Auditorium. 
Though students may have to walk, it is 
no different than in the main campus of 
IPFW, when students park in the back 
lots and walk to classes in Neff or Kettler 
Hails. 

There are many solutions for the 
administration to look into but il needs to 
be done soon, Procrastination of the new 
fine arts facility makes this a project to 
be completed now, not ' 'some time in the 
near future." 



Reorganization plans: 
a change for the better 



Purdue University President Steven 
Beering has charged Thomas Wallace, 
IPFW's chancellor, with the 
responsibility of changing the way IPFW 
is organized. 

Right now, IPFW is divided into 
departments, according to their school 
affiliation. With the proposed changes, 
the university would be organized 
according to their discipline 

With the present plan of having 
several departments it might be 
awkward for a student if he or she wants 
to double-major in areas which are in 
separate departments and have 
separate university affiliations. For 
example, if a student wants to double- 
major in sociology and psychology, he or 
she has to contend with the confusion of 
dealing with two whole separate 
departments, even though sociology and 
psychology are related disciplines. The 
new reorganization plan, which will be 
sent to Beering by Dec. 1, will make such 
curriculum matters run more smoothly 
for students. 

Such a reorganization will streamline 
a scheduling procedure for the faculty 
involved, as well as the students. With 
the example given above, a faculty 
adviser would have to deal with only one 
department, or one school, since all 
related disciplines would be housed 
under one school. The plan will save 
valuable time and money. If it takes a 
faculty advisor one hour to get a 
scheduling problem worked out now. the 
new plan will just hasten things. It is 
conceivable that the new plan would free 
up time for faculty. 



The new plan would also be more 
economically efficient in that it will 
allow for a combining of jobs. That may 
scare some people into thinking that 
they will lose their jobs. That fear is 
certainly understandable. Yes, it is 
conceivable that a job might be taken 
from one department and given to 
another. 

What is important to remember is that 
the chancellor is assuring people that 
their considerations will not be slighted. 
Faculty associated with one university 
or the other will not lose their designated 
affiliation. 

Secondly, all curriculum matters 
within a school must still be approved by 
the university from which they stem. 

Thirdly, vice chancellors and deans 
will be appointed without regard to their 
university affiliation. They will not be 
without affiliation, however. Their 
paycheck must still come from one 
university or the other. 

Probably the main thing (and most 
obvious) we all must keep in mind is that 
the reorganization plan will bring 
change. That is inevitable. The people 
making the changes must keep in mind 
that there will be a certain amount of 
anxiety among faculty here. 

Hopefully, after the changes have 
been made and everyone has settled into 
the new situation, IPFW will be better. 
IPFW will be better when the faculty 
sets aside their inhibitions about one 
university taking over, and when they 
just start working together to make 
IPFW work for its students. 





Can science solve the problem of man? 



By GREG BALIAN 
Today, science has 
dominated almost every part 
of modem man's life, from 
agriculture to zoology. Like 
a monstrous octopus, it 
stretches its rigid, 
prehensible tentacles into 
every nook and cranny, 
hoping to find a concrete 
theorem or a technological 
innovation. 

In view of the progress 
science has made, many 
people now believe mankind 
has found a panacea for all 
its problems. But there is one 
problem the purview of 
science cannot even 
penetrate: this is the 
problem of man. 
In recent decades, the 



world has been in the midst 
of a scientific and 
technological revolution. 
Under such circumstances, 
it is easy to understand why 
science has had an im- 

Commentary 

perious hold on our 
educational system. 
Through science, mankind 
has made gargantuan 
strides in the manipulation 
of the physical universe. 
Men can now grow more, 
travel faster and farther, 
and live a healthier and 
longer life with the aid of 
science. But in mankind's 
haste to quench his in- 



satiable thirst for scientific 
discovery and production, 
men have been confronted 
with many serious and un- 
pleasant situations, like 
ecology problems such as 
chemical and nuclear waste, 
and water and air pollution. 
Atomic weapons and 
reactors can eradicate the 
human race in a matter of 
minutes. 

We have seen what a 
thorough education in 
physical science can offer 
man: glorious fruits and 
desolate destruction. I leave 
this question to you: does 
science improve or harm the 
human condition? This is the 
type of question science is 



helpless to answer. 

Questions about right, 
wrong, good, evil, death, and 
creation relate to a more 
intimate and fundamental 
part of man than the theories 
and mechanisms of science. 
These are the types of 
questions that can relate to 
our humanity, the qualities 
and sympathies that make 
us human. Our relationship 
to other men, to nature, and 
to God, are questions that 
must be confronted with if 
we are going to know who we 
are and how we should act. If 
these questions are not 
answered, how can man 
effectively use the products 
of technology when he has no 
idea what he is and what is 



good for his existence? 

The scientific revolution is 
here and it has won. There is 
no turning back: man will 
not abdicate the scientific 
method in favor of ignorance 
and superstition. But science 
is not enough. Our 
knowledge of humanity must 
be redeemed if we are going 
to reap the fruits of 
technology. With the 
progress of science, our lives 
change rapidly. We must 
keep in touch with what 
makes us human, or surely 
we will be the slaves of 
science instead of its 
masters

Soviet journalists: fact or propaganda? 



By CAL THOMAS 

With the summit meeting 
between President Reagan 
and Mikhail Gorbachev a 
near certainty and with the 
resumption of arms control 
talks between the United 
States and the Soviet Union, 
it won't be long before we 
again see Soviet "jour- 
nalists" consulted for their 
supposed insights. 

The tendency of the 
American press, par- 
ticularly the television 
networks, to equate Soviet 
"journalists" with American 
journalists became a matter 
of serious concern to those 
who value balanced and 
objective reporting when 
ABC put Radio Moscow 
commentator Vladimir 
Posner on its network to 
comment on a speech by 
President Reagan. 

It is not that the American 
press is being duped The 
Soviets have told the world of 
the role their "journalists" 
play. 

In Pravda, printed in 
English in the United States 
by Associated Publishers of 
St. Paul, Minn., one can read 
about Soviet intentions. 

A recent front-page article 



headlined "Lofty Calling i 
Journalism" re-emphasizes 
the ideological agenda of the 
Soviet press: "True to 
Leninist precepts, the Soviet 
press serves as a collective 
propagandist, agitator and 
organizer of the masses. The 
efforts of editorial staffs are 
concentrated on illuminating 
the work of party 
organizations ..." 

And these other excerpts 
plainly state the function of 
the Soviet press: 

— "...our press (isl the 
true ally of die party in 
Communist construction and 
the tireless propagandizer of 
(he ideas of Marxism." 

— "One of the main tasks 
of the press is to actively 
popularize the Leninist path 
of our party In international 
affairs, developed by the 
congress. In this way, they 
will honorably serve the 
interests of strengthening 
socialism, the interests of 
workers and the interests of 
international peace." 

In its job description for 
good Soviet journalists, 
Pravda says that they must 
have Communist ideological 
qualities and that one of their 
main tasks is to "actively 



popularize the Leninist path 
of our party in international 
affairs In this way, they 
will honorably serve the 
interests of strengthening 
socialism..." 

Pravda speaks of the 
"interrelated ideological 
system, in which the press 
organs occupy an all- 
important place..." This Is a 
key distinction between the 
Soviet press and the 
American press, which 
operates as a con- 
stitutionally protected en- 
tity, independent of the 
government. But when the 
American television net- 
works allow air time to 
Soviet "journalists" without 
this explanation, they are 
equaling them with the in- 
dependent American press. 

After considering the 
quotations from Pravda, it 
seems obvious that 
Americans need the 
equivalent of Truth in 
Labeling for Soviet "jour- 
nalists" in the American 
press and on (he networks.

rLetter 



To the Editor: 

This is a copy of a letter 
sent to the police and safety 
department on campus: 

On Aug. 27, I received a 
ticket for parking on the 
grass. I wish to appeal this 
ticket. When the school sells 
a parking permit, there is an 
implied contract that the 
school hasa parking tot. This 
is not (he case during peak 
hours. It in essense DOES 
NOT have a parking lot. 

I arrived for class 25 
minules early, knowing 
parking would be difficult. I 
did not know it would be 
impossible. I drove around 
and around with dozens of 
other cars hopelessly looking 
empty spot. There 
were none. I HAD NO 



CHOICE. If 1 couldn't find a 
space in 20 long minules, I 
wasn'tgoingto. Thereareno 
options. You either park on 
campus or cross the bypass 
on foot, a safety hazard. I did 
not get a close spot, I parked 
on the very outskirts As 1 
was running to class, 
another desperate student 
actually asked if I was 
coming or going, to see if he 
could follow me to my car 
and park where I had been. I 
do not deserve this ticket I 
HAD NO CHOICE. In fact, 
I'd like to hear your 
suggestions on what to do for 
my next class, because I 
have absolutely no idea.

Chinese occupation trying time for exiled Tibetan journalists 

Speaker notes problems faced by newspapers 



By LILLIAN R.LYON 

Man* gfng Editor 

Last year was the 2Sth 
anniversary of the Chinese 
occupation of Tibet, a 
country located north of 
India and now considered a 
pari ol mainland China. 

But not everyone 
celebrated this anniversary. 

Last Monday, Tsering 
Wangyal, a member of the 
Tibetan Communlty-ln-Exile 
and editor of (he Tibetan 
Review, spoke at a public 
lecture held in the Walb 
Memorial Union. Wangyal, 
recipient of the Alfred 
Friendly Press Fellowship, 
is currently in the United 
States Interning in Jour- 
nalism at the Patriot-Ledger 
in Quincy, Massachusetts, 

At the lecture, which was 
attended by about SO people, 
Wangyal discussed the 
Tibetan Review, a monthly 
Journal published in New 
Delhi, India, and the 
problems Tibetan reporters 
encounter In covering the 
Chinese occupation of Tibet. 



In 1959, China "liberated" 
Tibet from what Chinese 
leaders first claimed were 
Western Imperialists, then 
changed to revolutionary 
religious leaders. Wangyal 
said the occupation is now 
considered an act of ex- 
pansionism by most 
historians. 

Since the occupation, news 
from Tibet came only from 
Xinhua (formerly Hsinhua), 
the Chinese news agency. 
This, as in the case of the 
USSR's invasion and oc- 
cupation of Afghanistan, 
lends to bias. All news from 
Tibet comes from the 
Chinese and gives out only 
what the Chinese wish to tell. 

Tibetans are now allowed 
to travel out of the country; 
however, they are classified 
as "Overseas Chinese" on 
their visas. The Chinese also 
allow outside visitors Into 
Tibet, and are trying to 
convince the Dalai Lama, 
the political and religious 
leader of the Tibetan 
Community-in-Exile, to 



return to Tibet from India. 
The Dalai Lama's return 
would induce most if not all 
Tibetans In India to return. 

The Tibetan Review, 
Wangyal's newspaper, Is one 
of many printed by members 
or the Community -in-Exile. 
Most are printed in English 
and attempt to inform the 
outside world of their 
situation. 

Although the Chinese now 
allow the religion of the 
Tibetans, Buddhism, to be 
taught in schools, along with 
the Tibetan language and 
history, they are still In 
control. The situation Isn't 
good for Tibetans who wish 
their country be returned to 
the rule of the Dalai Lama. 
The United States and other 
western countries recognize 
China as an official govern- 
ment to provide a lever 
against the USSR, and 
putting pressure on the 
Chinese government to with- 
draw from Tibet may cause 
the relationship to fall apart. 

The problems are many 
for Tibetans. In early 



summer, the brother ol the 
Dalai Lama was refused a 
visa to visit Tibet; he had 
visited previously and upon 
his return been critical of the 
Chinese occupation and Its 
effect on the Tibetans still in 
Tibet. 

Wangyal, who has been 
editor of the Tibetan Review 
for nine years, Is attempting 
to get around obstacles such 
as these to free Tibet from 
Chinese rule by letting the 
world know that all Is not 
well. 

It isn't easy, Wangyal 
says, because few people 
outside of the Tibetan 
community actually read 
Tibetan papers. In his trip to 
the U.S. he hopes to promote 
the views of his people in 
addition to learning more 
about Journalism. 

The lecture was sponsored 
by the department of an- 
thropology, the office of 
international programs, 
SUBOG, and the In- 
ternational Students' 
Organization.

Frisbee golf, SPRINT service both big hits at universities 



West Lafayette, IN - 
not really Frisbee, but it's 
not golf, either. There's a 
new game in town called 
"Disc Golf," and Purdue 
University has the first 
course in the area. 

"I've been amazed by tbe 
interest generated by that 
nine- hole course we had 
installed on campus," says 
Larry Preo, director of the 
Division of Recreational 
Sports. 

Preo said he had a number 
of phone calls from students 
last year requesting a disc 
golf course. "One student 
was a real pro — he'd even 
been to tournaments in 
Europe," adds Preo. 

One thing led to another, 



and Preo eventually 
arranged for the inventor of 

the game — Ed Headrick — 
to fly out from California and 
design a course for Purdue. 

Frisbee golf, as It Is 
popularly known, combines 
a golf course with a Frisbee 
— it is played like regular 
golf only using a Frisbee. 
Basically, the player throws 
the Frisbee to the various 
"holes" of the course. The 
object of the game, of 
course, is to land the frisbee 
on the right hole. 

"So far, I've played once, 
and it's more challenging 
than I would have thought," 
Preo notes. 

The course, which opened 
in August, was an instant hit, 



says Preo. "Every time I 
drive by, there seems to be a 
crowd of players lined up." 
It's located along Stadium 
Avenue in the area of David 
Ross Road. 

While the game is a 
challenge, it doesn't require 
(he skill level of golf, Preo 
notes. "Players with dif- 
ferent skill levels can enjoy 
the game together." 

Preo says Frisbee golf Is 
just the kind of activity the 
division of recreational 
sports likes to promote. "It 
fits in terms of a lifetime 
activity — serving all 
populations and skill levels," 
he says. 

As in traditional golf, the 
object of the game is to get

Bloomington, IN — When 
in a pinch, Bloomington and 
Indiana University campus 
employers have begun to 
depend on "IU Sprinters" to 
save the day. 

These strudents aren't 
members of the track learn. 
They are a part of IU 
SPRINT - or Student 
Personnel Ready in No Time 
— a temporary employment 
service started in 1934 by 
RJ's Student Employment 
Office 

At the beginning of each 
semester, students who are 
interested in working at 
temporary jobs sign up for 
the service. Employers who 
need temporary help can call 
the employment office and 
place a listing with the 
service, free of charge, and 
student workers will be 
referred to them. Although 
the office will provide 
suggestions about tees, all 



rates are arranged between 
employer and student 

Since the service began, 
Sprinlers have worked at a 
wide variety of Jobs such as 
registration, reception and 
office work, typing, feeding 
pets, research, bar tending 
and serving at parties, 
custodial work, computer 
assistance and delivering 
dorm refrigerators. They 
especially do a lot of yard 
work, housekeeping and 
babysitting for Bloomington 
residents, said coordinator 
Sally Gerrish. 

Employers have found the 
service very helpful, Gerrish 
said. Many use it to fill gaps 
during seasonal rushes or for 
special projects. "Some jobs 
Just don't require a steady 
employee. With Sprint, 
employers don't have to feel 
guilty because the job is 
temporary." 

Students like the service 



because it allows them to 
earn extra cash without 
committing to a steady job. 
"With my schedule and 
study habits, 1 need to 
schedule work around my 
life;' I need flexibility. I 
don't like lo be obligated to 
a regular job," said IU 
student Brent Hedrick. 

Sprinter John Gibson also 
holds a regular job, but he 
likes the people he meets 
through his temporary jobs. 
"I like the variety of 
SPRINT — it doesn't have 
the repetition that an or- 
dinary job does." 

Gerrish said the tem- 
porary service has been 
extremely successful and 
has caught on quickly among 
both students and em- 
ployers. Last spring, more 
than 170 students were listed 
with the program and 
Gerrish expects that number 
again in the fall.

Hoosier rocker 
set to perform 

By MICHEL E R. SHAFFER 
Edllor-In-Chief 

When Henry Lee Summer arrives in Ft. Wayne this 
weekend, the Hoosier rock star will show IPFW students just 
why his single, "Got No Money" climbed the charts to No. 4 
on Indiana's Music Survey. 

Summer will make a stop Sunday to play to a crowd of 
IPFW students this weekend on campus. His concert is 
scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. in the ampltheater outside 
Walb Memorial Union Building. Admission is free. If bad 
weather threatens to "rain on the parade," the concert will 
be moved to the Foellinger Theatre at Franke Park at 9 p.m., 
according to Lisa Davenport, concert chair for the Student 
Union Board of Governors. 

For the past several years, Summer, a native of Brazil, 
has been "paying his dues" in Indianapolis, Louisville and 
other collegetown nightclubs. He became such a hot item in 
those areas that in 1984 he was asked by incumbent governor 
Robert D. Orr to do a music video with Orr to campaign. 

Orr was looking lo attract the attention of voters in the IB to 
24 year-old group. Summer apparently liked the idea, 
because he agreed to work with Orr "When the young people 
see it, it's going (o be like, 'Hey, this man is definitely cool,'" 
said Summer in an Indianapolis Star article. The video 
featured Summer's song "Stay With Me," and drew the 
attention or Newsweek magazine and "ABC Nightline." 

Jazz show scheduled 



David Kay, coordinator of 
jazz studies at rPFW, will 
bring his combo and his 
comments on the state of 
jazz to a concert Saturday on 
the ampitheater of Walb 
Memorial Union Building at 
7:30 p.m. 

"(I want to) help people 
understand what's been 
happening in jazz during the 
past 35 years," said Kay 



about the scheduled per- 
formance. 

"It's going to be real 
spontaneous and a lot of 
fun," said Mary Isabel 
Rogers, coordinator of the 
event. 

Titled "Jazz on the 
Campus," the event will cost 
$2.50 and tickets are being 
sold in the Sweete Shoppe in 
Walb Memorial Union and 
local music stores.
