Health Care - Mark Souder 



By,Petef Scnellenberger 

KluipiOl «tludciiujplw.edu 



It's naive to ihink Ihat 
the current healthcare 
debate is simply about 
whether or not everyone 
deserves free or even af- 
fordable health care, no 
it's about much more. It's 
about capitalism, com- 
munism, socialism and 
patriotism; it's about 
tlie government's role in 
the lives of tlie Ameri- 
can people, the secu- 
rity of our civil liberties, 
the right to choose and 
the existence of the II- 
luminati. Vet more than 
anything the health care 
debate is about Barack 
Obama and Glenn Beck. 

All of these topics 
were discussed at Mark 
Souder's Healthcare 

Town Hall Meeting in 
The Auer Performance 
Hall at IPFW on Friday 
Aug. 28, 2009. 

An hour before the 
doors were even opened 
two groups of activists 
gathered to protest a va- 
riety of issues. 

I'irst on the scene 
was lloosiers for a Com- 



monsense Health Plan- a 
group who lobbies for 
single payer, univer- 
sal healthcare. "When 
there is 47-50 percent 
uninsured, in one of the 
wealthiest nations in the 
world there's a moral di- 
lemma," said Pat Moore, 
the groups' spokesper- 
son. 

Second to arrive was 
an unorganized assem- 
blage of demonstra- 
tors with signs that said, 
"We're not Republi- 
cans... We're not Demo- 
crats... We're Americans". 
One protester, named 
Chris, said " [Obama'sl 
lied constantly, all you 
have to do is look these 
things up, they aren't ru- 
mors they aren't theory's 
they are facts, look them 
up on jwfVAv.glennbeck. 
comr.The so called facts 
that Chris was referring 
to are Obama's personal 
militia; his emasculation 
of the military, banking 
and car industries; and 
worst of all: his apology 
for the American people. 

After the actual town 
hall began things went 
from bad to worse. The 
crowded auditorium 



teemed with constitu- 
ents ready to plead their 
cases. Most had valid 
concerns and were just 
worried for the well be- 
ing of their friends, fami- 
lies and selves while oth- 
ers turned the forum into 
a soapbox for paranoid 
rants about their fear of 
communism, opportun- 
ists, death panels and 
centuries old conspira- 
cies that have recently 
become popularized by 
the likes of author Dan 
Brown and the film in- 
dustry. 

Tlie one thing that 
most of the participants 
agreed upon was the idea 
tliat the current health- 
care system is flawed 
and needs reformation; 
however they don't want 
government bureaucrats 
to be the ones making 
the decisions. 

A week later, the 
healthcare debate is still 
burning up the air waves 
and newspaper head- 
lines across America, 
but the conflagration of 
public opinion that con- 
sumed the IPFW's North 
Campus has since smol- 
dered.

PULITICS AND MONEY

Rejection Philosophies rAMPilQ PANDEMIC PLAN 

j Is washing your hands enough to prevent the spread of the flu? 




By Amanda McCann 



STUDENT BODY 
PRESIDENT 



Spending student government money is like dat- 
ing; you have to decide the besi way to distribute a 
finite amount of resources. In dadng, time and en- 
ergy are your resources; in siudeni governmeni, the 
resource is money. Student government funds events 
for student organizations and travel requests that 
pop up throughout the year. It's a large budget, but 
just like your own time and energy, it's not infinite. 
Eventually you have to choose between the keepers 
and the Iet's-just-be-£riendly-acquainiances, and I've 
noticed four major philosophical approaches to do- 
ing this:. . - 

The first is the Personal Approach. Lei's check 
out some (mostly exaggerated) examples of this, in 
both categoriesr "You're self-absorbed and your ram- 
bling stories about your childhood are frankly just 
disturbing. Stop calling me." "That event is so bor- 
ing no one would go and ltd be a waste of money.' 
"These students tried really hard — we should reward 
them for their effort." 

Now the Logistical Approach; "Look, I like 
you, but I don't date Communists." "Sorry, we don't 
fund events involving animal sacrifice." "They filled 
out all the paperwork properly, so what's the prob- 
lem?" 

Free Market Competition; "If Reginald 
doesn't make a move, I'm going to the masquerade 
ball with Vincent." "That's the best line of the night — 
go for it." "Why would we pay for a local rock band on 
Thursday when we've already booked the American 
Idol tour for Friday?" 

And finally, what 1 like to call the Slimy Hook- 
up Theory; "Last Friday I got drunk and let that creep- 
er take me home — how can 1 now say no to this fairly 
nice-seeming guy who just wants to buy me dinner?" 
"We granted those newlyweds' travel request to tour 
vineyards in Paris. How can we now deny anyone's 
travel request, ever?' 

Personal rejection smarts, but logistical 
elimination is very frustrating for the receiver. The 
free market certainly makes sense for American eco- 
nomics, but explaining to A why he couldn't measure 
up to B is just sad. The Slimy Hook-up Theory is eas- 
ily unraveled in principle ("Stop making stupid mis- 
lakesD, but a lot harder to ignore when looking into 
tear-stained eyes and e.\plaining: "Yes, (we sent that 
couple to the vineyards of France|/|l dated Bub the 
drunfcardl, but [we've now decided diat your confer- 
ence in Colorado is frivolous! /(l think of you more as 
a friend]," tf smdent government isn"t going (o bring 
scorn upon itself by giving money to everyone who 
asks for it, it has to say no sometimes. When and why? 
Ttying to answer that question in the fairest way pos- 
sible is one of the constantly teoccurring debates. I've 
presented to you an analytical breakdo^vn of some of 
the most common answers. So hey, what are your 
thoughts? You have a clean perspective, and you're 
the one ive're doing all this for am-way. Swing by VValb 
225 to talk it out. or drop me a line at »iupra#ipfw etlu

You wake up with a 
fever, sore throat, chills 
and extreme fatigue — 
you can't even roll over to 
get out of bed. As you lie 
there, feeling sicker than 
you've ever been, you 
know you have the llu. 

lust like the illness 
hits you, you quickly turn 
on the television and see 
the newscasters talking 
about the dreaded Flu 
Pandemic. Slowly drink- 
ing 7Up. you wonder if 
this sickness could be 
part of the pandemic. 

The good news is 
that the university has a 
thorough Pandemic Plan 



in place to assuage any 
worries about the fiu.

By Katy Anderson 

kalhryan.dnderiondgrTUil com 



International experts 
on world trade regula- 
tion will be coming to 
IPFW to participate in a 
research conference. 

The Philosophy Club 
at IPFW was given a 
gran t from IPSGAlo fund 
an Intemalional Con- 
ference on World Trade 
Regulation at IPFW. 

This event is free and 
open to anyone in the 
community who is inter- 
ested. ltstartsat8:lSam 
and will take place Sept. 



18-19 in either the Walb 
Ballroom or the Neff 
auditorium. Speakers 
from overseas and from 
the U.S. vrill be featured 
and will explain the per- 
ception of the impact 
international trade has 
on poverty and human 
rights. 

On Friday, the pro- 
gram will feature 'around 
the world" petspecdves 
on global trade from in- 
ternational economists 
and speakers. In the af- 
ternoon, an expert pane! 
will discuss these per- 
spectives as objectively 
as possible. 



On Saturday perspec- 
tives from American 
society will be empha- 
sized. Those featured 
in this portion of the 
conference will include 
the AFL-CIO, Feminists,

IPFW philosophy 

professor and director of 
the IPFW Human Rights 
Institute Clark Butler 
identified the speakers 
who will be presenting. 
Along with enlighten- 
ing the iPFW and Fort 



Wayne community, But- 
ler hopes this will also 
bring more attention to 
the Graduate Certificate 
in Human Rights Stud- 
ies that will be available 
at IPFW. This graduate 
certificate would also 
be very unique in the 
Midwest, as a program 
like this would be more 
typical in the east or west 
coasts. 

"We hope this will 
provide a rational justi- 
fication of human rights 
and maybe change the 
mind of those in the way 
of human rights," Butler 
said.

Suicide Prevention Weeic 

"It's National Suicide Prevention Week: You could save a Life" 



By Alice Jordan-Mtles 



Every 15.8 minutes someone dies 
by suicide in the US. Six million Ameri- 
cans have altempted to kill themselves, 
with 832,500 Americans attempting 
suicide each year. In any given month, 
5-6% of the population is thinking of 
suicide. 

Indiana ranks 21" in the nation for 
its suicide rate with a rate of 13.1 people 
per 100,000 dying by suicide each year 
(American Association of Suicidology). 
In 2006, suicide was the 11"' leading 
cause-of death for Hoosiers ages 15-54, 
For younger Hoosiers age 10-24, sui- 
cide was the 3"* leading cause of death. 
According to the 2007 Indiana Youth 
Bisk Behavioral Survey which includ- 
ed Indiana's 9th through 12th graders. 
1 8.9% of girls and 13.3% of boys had se- 
riously considered attempting suicide 
in the last year. 

Although suicide ranks high as a 
cause of dealli for young people, el- 
derly white males are the highest risk 
group in relation to their numbers, with 
approximately 34 suicides per 100,000 
people. There are more than four male 
suicides for every female suicide. How- 
ever, at least twice as many females as 
males attempt suicide. 

Suicide is a public health problem 
thai is preveniable. Depression and 
suicide are directly linked to one an- 



other: Over 90% of people who die 
by suicide arc suffering from a mental 
illness, such as depression, v/hich is 
frequently undiagnosed, untreated or 
undertreated. Depression is Ireatable- 
■studies indicate that the best way to 
prevent suicide is through the early 
recognldon and treatment of depres- 
sion and other psychiatric illnesses. 
Part of that detection is being aware of 
typical warning signs. They are: 

• Talking about suicide or dying 
/ making a plan. This ^could 
include statements iucB as ^I 
wish 1 were dead", or "Everybne 
would be belter off with ont me", 

• Being preoccupied with deaih 
and dying, including writing 
poems, stories, or letters that 
talk about death.

Marriage 



Why do girls feel the need to jump into thinking 
about marriage a couple months into a relationship? 

Girl: Trying to answer a question like this is dif- 
ficult since not all females are like this. The idea of 
marriage is a dream thai has been ebbing on the edge 
of some women's brains since they were children. For 
other women, they have never wanted to get mar- 
ried. If TOU took into ihe past i.ia movies and books 
or maybe eve»your family, you will see examples of 
women marrjing at very young ages. Since there are 
more females'in the world than males, when a wom- 



an finds a man with marriage potential, she thinks 
abnul il from ihe beginning. 

It also depends on what age we are looking al. In 
America, dating at a young age is not typically for the 
long haul, it is just for fun. In college, the possibil- 
ity of marriage becomes real as women start to plan 
for their futures. And il is not only women who think 
about marriage early in a relationship. Men in their 
late tivenries and thirties who want to get married 
but do not have a potential spouse tend to look for 
women who are ready for a serious relationship, if not 
marriage. These men are usually finishing up Iheir 
degrees, saving money and preparing to ovm a home- 
So it is not necessarily women alone that are in a 
rush to be married. Saying that all women are ready 
to walk Ihe aisle tivo months into a relationship is 
nonsense: it just depends on the individual and the 
situation. There are many factors that contribute to 
a situation such as age, experience, background, reli- 
gion, culture, finance and education. If you, sir, have 
a problem with women wanting lo marry you,,, well 
that is your problem. The only thing you need to fig- 
ure out is whom you would like to spend the rest of 
your life vvith. 

Boy: This is a toss up; depending on who the giri 
is, it could be for a number of reasons. She could have 
grown up with low confidence or not too many close 
friends or family and just really longs for some stabil- 
ity in her life. She could have just watched loo many 
Disney movies growing up and desires that princess 
fairy tale ending more than anything, or maybe she 
needs a green card really badly Who knows, but its 
not right. It takes time to get to know someone, and 
even when you know them pretty well: it takes time to 
see if your personalities will truly match well together 
given time, A few months are not enough time to test 
that out. I am no e.xpen at relationships, but we are 
all growing up. Some of us will see that who we were 
a year ago is not the same person we are today. Thai 
docs not mean avoid serious relationships, but ma- 
turity is what keeps a relarionship together, and a big 
partofbcing mature is leaminghow to use your heart 
and your common sense at the same time. 



IPFW archaeology professor 
discovers old Mayan city 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

idviptO I Cil vdenti i pfw. «ju 



There is a saying 
in Ihc worid of academia 
and higher education 
that goes 'publish or 
perish." This phrase basi- 
cally means that if a pro- 
fessor doesn't publish his 
or her research than he 
or she, will subsequently 
perish and all their work 
will be for naught and 
will have basically wast- 
ed their time and energy. 

In some cases, 
the punishment for not 
publishing can be so 
drastic that professors 
could loose the chance 
to gain advancement 
in employment and the 
loose the respect of Ihe 
academic community. 

In Older to pub- 
lish, a professor must 
do lengthy research over 
a specific topic in their 
^ven discipline. Some- 
times thb research can 
lead to huge finds, such 
is the case with Dr. Chris- 
topher Andres, MayanisI 
and Assistant Profe^or 
.of.^thropologyat IPBV, 
fmr Dt Andres co-di- 



rects an archaeology field 
school with Dr. Gabriel 
D. Wrobel of the Uni- 
versity of Mississippi at 
Oxford, in Caves Branch 
River Valley in the Cayo 
District of south-central 
Belize, 

During the sum- 
mer of 2009 Andres and 
Wrobel stumbled upon a 
previously undiscovered 
Mayan city, that they are 
currently calling Tipan 
Che'cn Uitz or "fortified 
mountain wall." 

The discovery 
of this new site and ihe 
research he did through- 
out the summer was the 
topic of his speech to 
the Anthropology Club, 
'Incidents of Archeol- 
ogy in The Caves Branch 
River Valley, Belize Sum- 
mer 2006' on Wednesday 
September 2. 

In his speech, 
Andres called the new 
setdement a 'major cer- 
emonial center' and the 
'largest site foimd in Be- 
lize in the last decade.' 

,-\ndrcs' col- 
league Dr. Wrobefs will 
be at IPFW to elaborate 
on this new site, on No-

Metavari greeted by full house at CD release 



By Mike Shaffner 

KhjFiHlo lailudtnii-iplwKiu 



II docs not always take words 
to influence a listener of music. On 
August 28th. 2009, at Indiana Techs 
Cinema Center, Metavari held a 
show for the release of Be One of Us 
and Hear No Noise. "The contrast of 
undeniably digital elements like laptop 
programming alongside organic rock 
arrangements and vintage equipment 
create a multi-layered landscape of 
sound that has given the act national 
attention," says their website 

This being my first Metavari show, 
1 was a bit surprised at the location; 
altliough it was very creative. Cinema 
Tech in the Andorfer Commons at 
Indiana Tech was packed pretty much 
to capacity as Metavari began their 
show, utilizing the movie screen with 
visuals that apparently were taken 
from NASA television, (a channel 
most people do not even know exists, 
I think), several animations of what 
appeared to be original artwork by the 



band, and a video ofa Utile French girl 
telling a, "story that never ends," 

The music of Metavari is 
fundamentally sound and not complex 
as some instrumental bands feel 
the obligation to be due to lack of 
words. Their music is all they need to 
exercise their point to the audience, 
to whom the band seemed quite 
comfortable being in front of; even 
joking after the ver&gt;' first song, which 
was ended a little prematurely due to 
technical difficulties, about how it was 
disheartening lo have such problems 
early on. but hopefully they (the 
audience) would enjoy the rest of the 
show. And enjoy it we did. 

There were a number of guest 
performers, including the keyboardists' 
brother helping out on the keyboard 
for one song; three string instruments 
on several of the songs; and one song 
thai involved two guest guitarists 
and a guest drummer, as well as the 
three people on string instruments. 
This was the final song, titled Pacific 
Lights and definitely swept the crowd 



song on both the album and the set 
list), intricacy, and definitive Metavari 

sound. I, for one, feel compelled to say

with its length, (as it was the longest ABOVE: A Metavari band member. 



that I was moved by this song more so 
than the rest of the songs in the set. 
which included all of the songs from 

"Their music is all 
they need to exercise 
their points to the 
audience, to whom the 
band seemed quite 
comfortable in front 
of^ 

Be One of Us except for one, and, at 
the beginning of the show, part of an 
experimental project that the band 
said would only be released in Japan, 
entitled The Sound of Silence. 

The performance twas an entirely 
well presented show, with great visuals, 
amazing music, good sampling, and 
an atmosphere almost equivalent to 
watching a play. Metavari is a modest 
yet powerful display of how the modern 
artist can thrive in more than field 
of ariistic creativity, and make many 
friends while doing so; enough, even, 
to fill a movie theater with.

writer Chuck Ragan bode 
his time after the dis- 
bandmem putting out 
solo work on his own. 
Chucks first full-length 
solo release Feasi or 
Famine pleased fans of 
Hot Water Music along 
with creating new fans 
of his own. His newest 
release. Gold Country, is 
certain to hold similar 
results. 

The new album is re- 
Former Hot Water markably more country 
Music singer/song- than Feast or Famine 




which was strongly folk 
in nature, however Ra- 
gan still holds true and 
strong in his triumphant- 
ly honest songuriting. 
Each track is brilliant in 
its own right. Stand out 
tracks like "Done and 
Done" are laden mth 
themes of perseverance 
and devotion. It is easy 
to imagine a crowd of 
strong followers chant- 
ing and clapping right 
along with Ragan at the 
live show "Oh let it go, 



cut loose and roll, rock 
steady, oh get up stand 
up! Throw your hands 
up!" 

Other tracks rely heav- 
ily on the instrumen- 
tals which, surprisingly, 
evoke just as much emo- 
tion as the lyrics. "Don't 
Say a Word" holds a very 
country- we stern twang 
while "Ole Diesel" in its 
sad and hopehil honesty 
holds imagery in music 
that paints a crystalline 
picture in surroundings 



and allows the listener 
to escape from their cur- 
rent environment and 
drift with him for this 
four minute and thiriy- 
one second odyssey 

No matter what your 
music affiliation may be, 
pick up this album. The 
instrumentals are well 
put together and Bagan's 
vocals, though rough 
and raspy at times, have 
the ability to speak to the 
masses with a relatable 
understanding.

METRO STATION, (S®[B[MygfiR^;Ji^[H][ 



By Mark Cox 

cDiinua7mnid«(iU.ip(w edu 



The night before ihc show when I heard Good Char- 
lotte bailed on the Hoosier stale brought a tear lo my 
eye, but not out of sadness. Although I used lo be a fan 
of their first album in middle school and used to listen 
to It when I was cool enough to listen to It on the bus to 
and from school, their new album wasn't as cool. I have 
got to hand It to them, though, because apparendy "un- 
foreseen circumstances" went down beyond the bands 
control and could not make it to the concert— which 
is rumored that one of the member's significant other 
was going into labor. The band's website claims thai the 
whole band is "reaffy bummed" they could not make il 
to the show, whether or not they really are bummed. 

I was really kind of disappointed thai 1 wouldn't get 
the opportunity to rip apart a band that 1 figured could 
put on a horrible show, but once I saw a certain perfor- 
mance my night of being sad about Good Charlotte not 
attending ended and gave me something to open my 
hear t to: Katie Chonacas. 

"Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. Katie 
Chonacas got her start in a city that knows about hard 
work. ..she is knoivn as a consummate entertainer." 
is straight from the biography on the official Katie 
Chonacas website. "Her constant work ethic, combined 
with extensive Uaveling and an open mind for new ex- 
periences helped Katie to quickly acquire a depth and 
wisdom akin to a seasoned veteran." 

Before this performance I was trying to find a 
MySpace Music page for her to listen to her work, but 
apparently she is most known for dancing and perform- 
ing on stage. I kept an open mind until I heard her at- 
tempt to sing and almost went deaf from the horrible 
frequency ofner voice. She reminded me of a chipmunk 
on Helium with her lyrics full of nonsense and no-sense. 
She has two ihree backup dancers; two women and one 
man. All I can say is thai if she were a dancer she should 
be good and just dance and not sing, but she definitely 
cannot dance as well. 

The crowd booed her between songs and shook their 
fists at her while she kept her warm smile and jean jack- 
et and other 90's ouifils. Before her last two songs she 
received obscene gestures from the crowd showing their 
appreciation for her performance and look one last hit 
from the crowd yelling in disdain of her showing her 
face in beautiful Parkview Field. Clearly, Fort Wayne was

not a show for her. She would not have looked so bad 
if she did not have back-up dancers that were better 
than her at what she is supposed to be knoivn for. 

That out of the way, Rushmore, a band currchUy 
in MTV's Music Video Award contest performed and 
were pretty good from what I could pick up. They 
made it through round one of the contest with their 
music xddeo for "The Wake-Up Call." 

Metro Station performed all of iheir songs witli 
their energetic group and hyperactive lead singer. 
Trace Cyrus. Miley Cyrus's broiher. They put on a great 
show and got everyone really pumped up to see Co- 
bra Starship. Metro threw out a lot of things for fans, 



including picks, head-bands, shirts and drumsticks. 
I was lucl^ and agile enough to catch a drumstick 
while on the job or reporting the concert. 

Cobra Station brought all the excitement in, hav- 
ing over half the audience never hearing them be- 
fore. Off the bat the lead singer wasn't very energetic 
and looked kind of bored to be on stage, however 
throughout the rest of their set he goi warmed up and 
let loose. 

Overall it was a great concert besides Katie 
Chonacas's performance. I was really dreading at- 
tending this concert and il was anything but horrible. 
And the press credentials didn't hurl much, either...

Roommate's Pick: Collective Sou 



By Mark Cox 

coinuH}] Onudenti.lp[iH cdu 

There comes a sad time in every musician's career where they can 
no longer write good songs, no longer keep their style and — best of 
yet — meet their denuse in failure to capture their old fans and scaring 
away hope of any new listeners. The nineties were hill of good times 
and great music \sfhich filled the hearts of badly dressed women and 
men in their windbreakers and awkward vests for a decade. Once a 
generation of people change their clothing style, their style of appre- 
ciated music also adjusts with those new styles and haircuts and then 
they come into the twenty-first century and try to fly their fans to 
planet Pluto (oh, and about that..) with their amazing and reformed 
sound. 

Collective Soul used to be a good band to listen to remember the 
90's and how the music influenced me as a child, although now after 
listening to their latest albuun. 1 will reconsider this. After a decade or 
so I believe a band should just give up trying to revive their fame and 
move on with a new project, whether it be acting or a different music 
endeavor. 

When first given the Collective Soul "Rabbit" album to review, I 
was skeptical from the beginning of how their sound would be in 
comparison of their 90's work. 1 wasn't pleased to hear the first song 
and when the second song. "Fuzzy", came on, I was kind of confused 



if I was listening to Collective 
Soul or if someone slipped a 
Weezer track on my CD be- 
cause the intro included some 
whistling. Well, it wasn't Wee- 
zer, and definitely wasn't The 
Killers or Smashing Pumpkins 
helping out, either. Listen- 
ing to their songs they seem 
to try and incorporate a lot 
of things used in today's pop 
music, which really does not 
mesh well with their rock band 
soimd. With the excessive 
whistling, snapping and sound 
effects, it sounds like Weezer, 
Soundgarden, Nickelback, Owl City and all kinds of other horrible 
sounds that shouldn't be mixed together. They might as well have had 
Tenacious D help them with their music. 

It sounds like I'm far from a fan of Collective Soul which is not 
true, however their new stuff is horrible compared to their work in 
the 90s. Apparendy, though, they have been releasing albums a lot 
this past decade, however they have been under the radar and had 
not gained any popularity. I'm even confused as to what genre to 
throw this album mto as it sounds like it is all over the place.

new generation of fans. 

Instant favorites of 
mine like the Kanyc assist- 
ed 'Hale', leaves your ste- 
reo pounding and your head 
nodding. The song 'Thank 
You' gives you a jazzy feel 
like you're a high roller 
m the 70s and brings you 
what could be the greatest 
third verse in hip hop his- 
tory with a 9/11 metaphor 
that destroys any ego of any 
nay-saycr out dierc. 

'Star Is Bom" is 
a feel good record with a 
swing vibe that has Jay 
giving compliments left 
and right to his peers he 
admires. J.Cole, the first 
signee to his new label Roc 
Nation, ends die song widi 
a gTMt verse which leaves 
us thinking that a star may 
have really just been bom 
right here and now. 

The album isn't 
without its weak moments. 
The Swizz Bcatz produced 
'On To The Ne-xl One' and 
the drake and timbaland 
collabo, "OfT Thai", are 
both fine dance tunes, but 
die subject matter has been 
done before by Jay on '30 Is 
The New 20' from his out of 
retirement album. Kingdom 
Come. 



There are also some 
songs which aren't bad but 
don't live up to their poten- 
tial. The song he has with 
Kanyc's prol^gi. Kid Cudi, 
offers us a stale beat with 
stale lyrics to go with it. 
Some nice lines are blended 
in and Cudi gives us a decent 
chorus, but it ends up getting 
boring by the lime you hit 
die 2" verse. 

Run This Town fea- 
turing Kanye and Rihanna 
and D.O.A. are the obvious 
standout tracks, both giving 
you an energy you haven't 
felt fivm rap music in a long 
time. The last track, 'Young 
Forever' which samples the 
80s synth pop song, 'Forever 
Young', gives us Jay's clos- 
ing words and a promise that 
he will be here forever. Mr, 
Hudson offers a beautiful 
chorus, completely gripping 
you into the song. Hip Hop 
is a young man's game, but 
Jay's spirit hasn't gouen a 
bit older from Ihe sounds of 

diis. 

While this album 
isn't perfect, it still holds its 
weight amongst the com- 
petition. Sometimes it gets 
too stuck in reminding us 
wtiai he's previously done 
rather than what he's doing 



now, but if you even begin 
to tiiink Jay's just an old 
man who's lost his touch, 
he comes up out of nowhere 
and hits you with his famous 
razor sharp wordplay that no 
one has been able to com- 
pete wih. "They think I'm 
out of shape, so I have lo jog 
their memory", he says on 



Reminder. This "new clas- 
sic" offers a lot of good to 
the world of music. Sub- 
stance, unity, and pure raw 
talent Jay's just given us 
the new blueprint to being 
a great rapper and making a 
great album. Hopefully, the 
artist of today will sit down 
and take notes.

The Swiss Army Knife of Social Networking 



By Craig Lloyd 

lal 3 1 loydaip fwtommu n iCJl or 



Social netivorking has certainly boomed in re- 
cenl years and is now almosl an integral part of 
our lives in some cases. First there was MySpace, 
whicli gave you the opportunity lo offend your 
friends by noi including them in your "Top 5" and 
then wonder why ihey wouldn't talk to you the 
next day. Then came along Facebook, which re- 
cenlly topped MySpace in total users and is now 
no longer just a social networking site for teenag- 
ers and young adults of sorts, but its starting lo 
gel noticed by the older folks, whether you like it 
or not. Oh, and how could I forget Xanga? Because 
no one uses it, that's how. 

About the time that Facebook really took off, 
TWitter was just getting started. Many were pon- 
dering the implementations of the little features 
thai IWitler offered and some are slill wondering 
about that today. With only a box limited to 140 
characters to use, many think that TWitter is just 
another lame attempt at social networking, or is 
it? 

Many users miss the underlying trails oftXvit- 
ter that make it so powerful. It's not just a place to 
tell people what you're currently chowing down 
on or what your recent ramblings are. That's just a 
small fraction of what you can do with this simple 
social networking tool. 

First of all, TWitter is an incredible marketing 
and promotion tool. Let's say for example that 
this one company (we'll call it Company A) tweets 
about their new product. Company A's follow- 
ers will receive that tweei. The follower then has 
the ability lo retweet that tivect to their follow- 
ers. This cycle can continue on forever if it really 
wants to, but depending on how many followers 




PholD by Sasdia Preuss 



.bubbielriends.de 



Company A has and how many limes the tweet has 
been retweeled. Company A will have reached a large 
number of users with jusi a simple 140 character (or 
less) tweet and a little help from their followers. It's 
much like a classic pyramid scheme, only this time 
it's completely legit. 

"Numerous celebrities have 

IVvitter accounts that you can 

easily follow and find out the 

latest gossip" 

If you're just a normal individual without a com- 
pany, 'Rvilter definitely still has it's uses. Besides 
the usual tweeting and communicating with your 
friends, TXviller can also be your one-slop shop for 



any kind of information. Many news networks 
(CNN. FOX News, etc.) have a TWitter feed and 
will iweet about the latest news going on in the 
world as well as any of your favorite niche blogs. 
Not only is news available, but some online retail- 
ers t^veet about their latest deals and sometimes 
have TWitter- exclusive giveaways. Ditto goes for 
product manufacturers as well. Many companies, 
like Dell and Comcast, even offer customer sup- 
port viaTWitter, who would've tliougbt? 

Numerous celebrities have TWitter accounis 
that you can easily follow and find out the latest 
gossip. Obviously, it's not any kind of informative 
news, but nonetheless it's fun lo see what your fa- 
vorite celebs are talking about and see what they 
do on a day-to-day basis when they're not busy 
making tons of money I just recently started fol- 
lowing Lance Armstrong and it's pretty cool to see 
what he does outside of the Tour de France that 
would otherwise be unknown to many Lance 
Armstrong fans. 

Now that you know the awesome features of 
the T\vitter universe, you're now probably won- 
dering why there are a lack of people using this 
amazing social siviss army knife. It's like I men- 
tioned earlier, social networkers think that T\vit- 
ter is simply dull and doesn't carry a lot of cool 
features ivith it that Facebook and MySpace rank 
supreme in. I assure you. the features are there, 
you just to need dig a little bit deeper and think 
outside of the box to really notice them. TWitter 
still has plenty of grovving to do, but once T\vitier 
does reach full throtde, it'll practically be its own 
information superhighway. 

So there you have it. TXvitter is not just about 
telling people what you had for breakfast. Wliat 
would be my closing words of wisdom to you fel- 
low social networkers? Get a TXvilter account and 
take advantage of it!

Baimer Pilot emerged 
out of Minneapolis. Min- 
nesota and has slowly 
been crafting a name for 
themselves nationwide. 
The fine tuned, hard to 
please ear may not have 



kind words to say about 
Banner Pilot, however 
their most recent re- 
lease Collapser may just 
change this. 

The album com- 
mences with the an- 
themic track "Central 
Standard," a strong intro- 
duction for a punk rock 
album chanting themes 
of self-destruction and 
alcohol. Following tracks 
explore themes of youth 
wasted and common 
mistakes made through 
the human adventures of 
post-regret. 

Lyrically the album 
is strong and the in- 
strumentals do well 
to compliment and 



not overpower the an- 
nouncements being 
made. In tracks like 
"Starting at the Ending" 
the instrumentals do 
well to back down while 
vocalist Nick Johnson 
mourns, "It doesn't re- 
ally matter where I look' 
the directions seem the 
same/ I'm closing out my 
nights with Fante books/ 
If you're happy, then why 
change?" 

For those well versed 
in the punk rock commu- 
nity, pick up this album. 
This is recommended 
for those with trained 
ears already in the genre, 
newcomers may not see 
the appeal.

The plan covers everything in minute detail, even 
including what campus officials will work from home 
in the event of an outbreak. State and local health of- 
ficials were consulted in the planning of the guide. 
But is the university ahead of other colleges across 
the state? 

"1 would say that our campus was well ahead of 
West Lafayette in our disaster plan and our questions 
that drove our planning. There was much debate re- 
garding liie use of distance education (Blackboard) 
for those who were well and could continue in their 
studies." she said. 



"However, the decision that both smdenu and fac- 
ulty could be negatively impacted by some students 
continuing some classes made the uniform decision 
about suspending classes logical." Stemberger said. 

The most important thing experts are saying to 
remember this fall to keep you healthy is to practice 
frequent hand washing, or use alcohol-based sanitiz- 
ing gel. It's also imponant to cover your mouth when 
coughing or sneezing and stay home and away from 
others if you are sick. Finally, if you do get sick, call 
your doctor or visit the IPFW Parkview Wellness Clin-

The age old complaint of there being 'noth- 
ing to do in Fort Wayne" is distinctly becoming 
a grievance of the past. The first annual Taste 
of the Arts Fort Wayne was held Saturday, Au- 
gust 29 as the latest installment of numerous 
events aimed at spurring activity in the down- 
town area. 

The one-day festival blocked off a portion of 
Main Street located directly in front of the Arts 
United Plaza. A fair number of booths repre- 
senting various fine arts groups attempted to 
fill Freimann Square as well as seventeen local 
food vendors in a surrounding four block area. 

For those of us who liked to stan our Satur- 
day's off hot and heavy, beer (and other savory 
foodstuff) was served between the hours of 
11:00 a.m. and 4:00 pm. Entertainment includ- 
ing (but not limited to) dancers, players, poets 
and actors performed inside the Arts United 
Center and showcased in the Plaza. 

Speaking of the events success, organizer 
and sponsor, Mark Michael expressed being 
'thrilled with the turnout.'' Suggestions were 
collected and supporters are looking forward to 
expanding and improving upon next year's cel-

IPFW has not had 
trouble increasing its 
enrollment of students, 
though it has not ex- 
perienced high levels 
of retaining students. 
TWenty-four percent 
of IPFW students will 
graduate within six 
years. In an effort help 
freshmen transition 
into college and retain 
more students, a new 
survey will be adminis- 
tered to IPFW first-year 
students. 

The survey is called 
MAP-Works, and ivill

This is the first time 
IPFW has conducted a 
survey like this, though 
it has previously been 
administered by over 100 
other institutions and 
has been researched for 
more than 20 years.

In week one of the college football season we have 
seen some good action, starting offwith 14 Boise State 
beating 1 6 Oregon. When the game was over Oregon's 
running back LeGarreite Blount sucker punched 
Boise Stale's defensive end Byron Hout in the jaw 
and then had to be restrained by coaches and cops 
from entering the stands. Blount has been suspended 
for the season. Indiana, Purdue, and Notre Dame all 
won in their home opener. Ohio State and Iowa both 
avoid huge upsets. Oklahoma Slate and Alabama 
held off their other top 25 counter pans. BYU knock 
off number 3 Oklahoma and also knocked out their 
Heisman quarterback Sam Bradford. 

In the NFL the commissioner Roger Goodell made 
a decision on Michael Vick coming back during week 
three. 

Some NFL teams (Jaguars, Colls, Raiders, Lions, 
etc.) are having trouble selling tickets, which could 
lead to local blackouts. This should not affect our 
area. 

Veteran Teddy Bruschi of the Patriots retired. 

As final cuts are made to the NFL rosters some 
big names were let go: Jeff Garcia (Raiders), Dominic 
Rhodes (Bills), and Zach Thomas (Chiefs). There 
were also some notable names traded: Patriots 
Richard Seymour lo the Raiders and Tampa Bay Luke 
McCown to Jaguars. 

During the Tennis US Open the men's bracket 
there has been one major upset with Andy Roddick 
losing in round three. 

On the women's side though there have been six 
big names knocked out with Ana Ivanovic in round 
one, Amelie Maurusmo, Jelena lankovic. and Blena 
Dementieva in round two. Maria Sharapova and 
Dinara Safina in round three. (Thru Saturday) 

In ihe MLB the \%ildcard races have been heating 
up. As the waiver deadline came to an end the 
Dodgers made two big moves picking up lim Thome 
and Ion Garland. 

In the world of Racing Danica Patrick will join ihe 
NASCAR Nationwide series and Truck series teaming 
up with Tony Stewart. 

In the NBA the Memphis Grizzles have shown 
interest in Allen Iverson. Veteran Bruce Bowen has 
decided to retire. Rookie Ricky Rubio signed a two- 
s-ear deal lo play with PC Barcelona. With that he will 
not play in the NBA until at least 201 1.

Students can look forward to an easier way to get 
money for collcge. 

The Obama administration launched a revamped 
version of the FAFSA in lune to encourage more slu- _ 
dents to apply for financiit aid. according to a press 
release from the U.S. Education Department. 

The new form currently features quicker grant 
estimates, but the majority of the changes, such as a 
shorter form and an option to insert financial infor- 
mation througli the Internet, will be ready for 2010- 
1 1 financial aid applicants. 

"There were a lot of questions (on the old form)." 
said Eriberto Velazquez, a San Jose State University 
junior computer engineering major. "I wasn't sure 
how long the actual form was the first time I did it, 
and it was a hassle to try and find all of the papers 
that 1 needed. " 

Starting January 2010. the online form will have an 
option for applicants to import their tax information 
straight from the Internal Revenue Senice. according 
to a press release from the department. 

Since May 2009, students have been able to re- 
ceive instant estimates of Pell Grant and student loan 
eligibihty after completing the FAFSA - a process thai 
previously took weeks - according to the press release. 

In the coming months, the Obama administration 
will ask Congress to remove financial information 
from the aid calculation formula that is not available 
from the IRS. according to the education department 
press release. If approved, 26 financial questions will 
be removed from the form. 

The depanment will also allow married students 



on junior Cory Keitz's as- 
sist. 

19 players saw action 
against Western Michi- 
gan. 

Goalkeeper Dowling 
had four saves. 

IPFW had 18 fouls 
and one player was yel- 
low carded. 

The men's soccer 
team then played Detroit 
Mercy on Sunday the 6, 
falling 1-0. Martinez had 
three shots and substi- 
tute senior Mitchell Hai- 
fley added three shots 
as well, out of IPFW's 11 
shots. 

Dowling had five 
saves. 

IPFW, now 1-2 on the 
season.will host Hun- 
tington University on 
September 9 at 7 p.m.

or independent students to skip questions about 
their parents. 

Students more than 24 years old or married are 
currently exempt from answering. those questions 
because Expected Family ContriBution estimations 
end at that age. The EFC determines how much a 
family's income will go toward supporting a student's 
college fees. 

According to the department press release, more 
than 90 percent of applicants use die online version 
of the FAFSA, instead of the paper form. The Educa- 
tion Department plans to take advantage of that and 
make navigating easier by introducing skip-logic - 
when students answer "no" to a question, the form 
will skip questions that don't apply to their form. 

Iris Delgado, a junior microbiology major, said 
a shorter version of the FvVFSA woiild make it more 
tempting to fill out. because the cumnt form is too 
long. 

Even though there is a chance more people will 
qualify for aid. one student thinks it might lessen the 
amount offered to everyone. 

"I think it will be a lot easier if it's shoner. but with 
the whole budget cuts and everything, the money's 
not really there," said Andrea Arroyo, a senior be- 
havioral science major. "It might be shorter, but you 
might receive less money." 

Part of the Obama administration's plan is to make 
college funds available to underprivileged students 
who don't seek higher education because of the lack 
of financial resources, according to the department's 
Website.
