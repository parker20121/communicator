for a boycott of all food

In an interview with cafe-

learned that the cafeteria

for aervlng food only when 
the clean up of the cafe-

the cooperation of students 
and faculty "buasing their

Health and aafty being 
Endangered by those persons 
eaving food and china on 
he tablea, chairs, and 
floors of the cafeteria 
Mere the main reasons for 
the return to disposables. 
Employees and students 
have had serious falla 
because of these items not 
being returned to the con-

of the cafeteria. Thieving 
jf the chins, trays, and 
silver is a serious prob-

If the china and other

'Catonsville' explosive drama 



By Liz Schevtchuk 

"The Trial of the Catons- 
ville Nine" Is billed as a 
modern play, or at best, a 
contemporary moral drama, but 
it Is more than a mere play, 
more thsn a drsma, more than 
a piece oE theatrics in any 
eenae of the word. 

It is an essence, an es- 
sence of Christian belief, 
of firm convictions, of the 
queatlons which necessitate 
answers and which too long 
have been Ignored, 

"Catonsville" is not en- 
tertainment, for it is the 
furthest thing removed 
from being a choice to en- 
able one to apend a quiet 
evening. 

"Catonsville" la dis- 
quieting; it's explosive in 



I Humanities plus I 
technology = ? I 



The sntlthesis between a 
technical and a liberal 
education Is fallacious. 
There can be no adequate 
technical education which 
is not liberal, and no 
liberal education which 
is not technical: that 
is, no education which 
does not impart both 
technique end intellect- 
ual vision. In simpler 
language, education 
should turn out the pu- 
pil with something he 
knows well and something 
he can do well. This 
Intimate union of theory 
and practice aids both. 

Alfred North Whitehead 
1917 



Che moral Implications It con^ 
tains and shouts to the aud- 
ience. It demands, and 
forces a search of self and 
a re-evaluation of person- 
al viewpoints on all le- 
vels of moral and legal 
Integrity It both con- 
demns and creates, as It 
both frightens and and in- 
creases faith. It under- 
mines snd it overwhelms, 
until audience participa- 
tion evolves Into an exper- 
ience of imnense magnitude 
chat does not allow the 
mind to forget. 

"Cstonsville" Is real- 
ity, bitter in truthful- 
ness, searing in Its con- 
sequence, and much too aue- 
aomely significant to be 
passed up. 



An editorial 

With all Che fuss about 
Che evaluation of teachers 
by students, here is a 
simple propoaal. 

Each atudent, on the baaie 
of personal criteria, gives 
his tescher a grade. A, B, C, 
0, or F. The grades given 
by Che students could be 
averaged for a composice 
evaluation. 



Taken furcher ,_ these stu- 
dent evaluations of teachers 
''ould be entered Into perman- 
ent records for admlnlstrstlve 
use in determining promotion 
and tenure. Cruel . 

Taken even further, 
teachers could be paid base 
salaries which they would 
collect proportional to 
their teaching performance. 
A teacher would collect all 
of his salary If he received 
an A from his scudencs, 907. 
of his salary if he received 
a B, snd so on. 

Granted, this would be S 
rotten evaluation; but then, 
ic mlghc hascen Che end of 
grading.

ALIENATION, ANOhQE AND THE 
AMERICAN STUDENT Part 2 
by Scott Gillie 

Alienation is a reality 
in American life. Alienation 
is not limited to students. 
It is pervasive of American 
Society. The university pro- 
vides a framework for dis- 
cussion of alienation as 



several 


elements 


in the un 


verslty 


context 


are analo- 


gous or 


represen 


tatlve of 


larger . 


orkings 


in society 


In many 


respects 


, the unl- 


verslty 


may be v 


iewed as a 



college or are on extended 
leaves of abscence from 
their schools. All were se- 
lected on a basis of per- 
sonality, rather than musi- 
cal ability and assigned to 
one of three international 
casts. 

The largest group, the 
cast which will perform in 
Fort Wayne, is non-academic, 
but the other two casts con- 
sist of students working for 
high school or college cre- 
dit while on tour. 

"Up With People" partici- 
pants write and arrange all 
musical numbers performed 
and perform the same selec- 
tions or similar numbers at 
each of the various stops on 
the t our . Among their 
choices for the Fort Wayne 
concerts are such songa as 
"Man Never Runs Out of Dreams' 
"Us", and "Let All the People 
In". 

Tickets, priced at 52 for 
students, S3 for general ad- 
mission, and 54 for reserved, 
may be obtained from the 
downtown L.S. Ayres store 
and the Southtown and Glen- 
brook branches of Indiana 
Bank. 

More information on "Up 
With People" is available from 
Young World Development at 
742-1241, or from any cast 
member after the completion 
of the performances. 



satisfaction perhaps? 

The parallels between tht 
American worker and the Ameci 
can student arc evident. Stu- 
dents are part of a process 
which is incomprehensible as 
a whole. Learning Is the 
objective But learning la 
done for teachers, for 
curriculum designers, for dt 
parcraent chairmen, for statt 



Learning emanating from ; 
sense of inner need in stu- 
dents is replaced with the 
imposition of a "learning 
process" which Is determined 
by everyone except Che stu- 
dent. Since it is Impoaslbl 
for students co fdencify 
]i(y^-'ith this alien process, somo 
thing is needed to motivate 
students to perform. Rather 
than pay students for their 
work, some genius created 
the symbolic extrinsic re- 
ward: the grade. "I'm only 
in it for the money; " be- 
comes "I'm only in it for Cli 
grade." 

Lost week, I mode mention 
of the student power move- 
ment seeking institutional 
change. The relationship 
between institutional prac- 
tices of factories, buslncsst 
and universities and the 
alienation of people as a 
consequence of Chose prac- 
Clces does not account 
fully for the degree and 
depth of alienation In Amerl 
can Society, 

Alienation from insCltu- 
tlons does not account for 
another aspect of alienation 
alienation from self. The 
student power movement, as 
well 38 the behavioral sci- 
ences has largely ignored 
Chis aspect of alienation. 

Alienation from self in- 
volves a breakdown in the 
individual's system of be- 
liefs. The breakdown pre- 
cipitates a loss of ffllth-- 
In self and in society. 

Anomle partially descrlbei 
the state of affairs. It 
is an ample subject for a 
life's work. It is beyond 
the scope of IntellectuaU z- 
atlon yet It cannot be ig- 
nored, I'll attempt to 
communicate some thoughts 
and feelings on the matter 
next week.

lienatlon sensed by 
students cannot be divorced 
from the alienation felt by 
professors and adminlsti 
tors. What is Che commi 
i.e. what Is alienation 

In labor -economic terms , 
alienation is viewed as the 
separation of the worker 
from the product of his 
labor. Particularly in the 
asaembly-llne process, a 
worker haa little identifi- 
cation with Che total pro- 
/duct. Often, a worker has 
little knowledge of the 
whole process of which he la 
a part. Work is performed 
for boases not for the 
worker . 

In this situation, the 
quality of workmanship suf- 
fers and the time spent on 
the Job is reduced to a rote 
procedure. When added to the 
fact that work for most peo- 
ple la not a matter of 
choice but a matter of what 
is available, work becomes 
an unpleasant (alienating) 
avoidance situation. 

To counteract this situ- 
ation, extrinsic rewards are 
offered to motivate worker 
performance. This is suf- 
ficient to rationalize work 
but Is Insufficient to make 
work meaningful. 

Alienation from work Is 
not limited to the factories. 
The organization of a tech- 
nological society with Its 
high degree of specializ- 
ation precludes involvement 
in the whole process of any- 
thing. 

This is certainly true In 
higher education. Professors 
are forced to specialize (many 
do so willingly but it Isn't 
a matter of choice). Their 
knowledge is fragmented. 

Someone once defined a 
Ph.D. as "learning more and 
more about less and less un- 
til eventually one knows 
everything there is to know 
about nothing." This la sad 
We need generallsts. 

Alienation from work is and/or skill to the school 

feature of American Society. P^per are welcome at the Com- 
"I'm only In It for the munlcator office In G-5.

plies that there nay be P"^ atoriea, copyread, do

First in a series 

For a democratic Armed Forces 



by SP/A Archie Llntz (ret.) 

When he first enters the 
Service the novice troop 1b 
told that "the mlllEflry 
can't be a democracy." The 
purpose of this kind of 
sermon la to purge the trainee 
of civilian Ideas about civil 
rights, to establish abso- 
lute martial authority as 
being legitimate, neceasary, 
and proper In his mind, and 
to re-eoclallze him In hablta 
of unquestioning obedience 
to that authority. 

The reasoning Is that 
military organizations by 
their very nature and pur- 
pose cannot be democratic, 
but that there is no menace 
to our domestic freedoms 
from the military because it 
exists within the context of 
the greater American demo- 
cracy. An Increasing numbar 
of American soldiers, sailors, 
and airmen, along with their 
alliea In the student, 
minority and labor movements, 
challenge that argument. 

We know that the Armed 
Forces can be democratic. We 
believe that the true meaaure- 
ment of our democracy Is 
life, not military might, 
and that the greatest 
strength of our democracy 
Is freedom, not authority. 
We recognize that hier- 
archy and discipline are 
necessary, but we challenge 
a hierarchy baaed on llmlt- 
leas power and prlvlledge, 
rather than a responsible 
one based on work snd per- 
sonal merit. 

Rather thsn a mindless 
discipline bssed on "orderly 
and reliable conduct" In 
every situation and under 
every circumstance, rein- 
forced with threats snd the 
"negative Incentive," we 
propose a discipline that 



would stress individual 
responsibility, foster com- 
radshlp, and which would 
strengthen democratic atti- 
tudes. 

Point two of the American 
Servicemen's Union's ten- 
point program demands "Elec- 
tion of officers by vote of 
the rank and file." Those 
who are aure this would over- 
throw our military estsblish- 
ment ought to be Informed 
by history that from the 
American Revolution until 
about 1900 this was not un- 
cooisonly the fashion in 
which the officer corps was. 
In fact, selected. 

It Is a radical ides, but 
not a new one. During the 
Civil War, for example, 
lieutenants snd captains were 
often chosen by the rank and 
file, and the latter officers 
would then elect field grade

Point three of the ASU pro- tlce Coordinating Council 



gram propoaes "An end to 
saluting and slr-lng of 
officers." Saluting is a 
tradition we took trom auto-

military outfits during the 
eighteenth century. It was 
meant as an indication of 
respect from rank and file 
soldiers to officer gentle- 
men of the nobility.

questa for criminal Jus- 



cally advanced as the US Armed 
Forces is three hundred years 
bsckward In terms of human 
relatione. 

In short, we no longer 
sccept the idea that "the 
mllltsry can't be a demo- 
cracy" as an adequate apology 
for the excesses of an 
illegitimate military hier- 
archy. 

We 8sy that we will accept 
nothing other than democratic 
atandards for our Armed 
Forces to measure up to in 
hierarchy and discipline. 
Militarism and democracy are 
not compatible.

"The Trial of rhe 
CalonsviDe Nine" 

"Let every soul be sub- 
ject unto the higher powers. 
For there Is no power but 
of God; the powers that 
be are ordained of Cod. Who- 
soever therefore restateth 
Che power, reslateth the 
ordinance of God: and they 
that resist shall receive to 

themselves damnation." 

Romans 13:1 ,2. 

St. Paul 'a writings led 
to the orthodox Chriatlan 
philosophy of opposition to 
civil disobedience. Among 
political theorists, St. 
Augustine was one o£ the fore 
most proponents of order. 
Pope Leo XIII. in hie 
Itnniortale Dei , sets forth a 
rather unbending Catholic 
position. "To despise 
legitimate authority, in 
whomsoever vested, is unlsw- 
ful, as a rebellion against 
the Divine Uill; and whoso- 
ever resists that rushes 
willfully to destruction. To 
cast aside obedience and by 
popular violence to incite 
to revolt, is, therefore, 
treason, not against msn 
only, but against God," 

la IC not Ironic chat the 
modern-day rebel heroes are 
Catholic priests? "The Trial 
of the Cstonavllle Nine", 
written by so-called Father 
Daniel Berrlgan, Is sn 
emotionally biased play writ- 
ten to sway public opinion 
behind the war reslsters. 
It stars himself snd his 
brother Phil . 

These Idolized priests 
led the group which broke 
Into the Catonsvllle, 
Maryland Selective Service 
center, end while there 
extracted some 378 draft 
files, packed them into wire 
baskets, burned them with 
homemade napalm, and in the 
procesa did some small in- 
jury to a clerk trying to 
protect the files. Is that 
pacifism? 

Earlier, when planning 
their Baltimore Four caper 
(Father Phil Berrlgan poured 
his own blood mixed with 
some delicatessen juice 
squeezed from a couple of 
blutwursts onto the draft 
records of the Baltimore 
Selective Service center), 
Father Phillip, often de- 
scribed as a gentle, saintly, 
soft-spoken priest, shouted: 
"Kids, we've got them by the 
balls. If they don't arrest 
ue next time, we give s 
mandate for all peace groups 
to enter government buildings. 
If they jail us, that'll be 
just the kind of witness I 
want Co offer." 

Pope Paul observed that 
Christians must act 
according to their conscience. 
But he, echoing the point 
made by Popes Pius XI and 

February H, 1972 



by Mark Souder 

Plus Xll, said that men need 
the guidance of the church 
to avoid error in applying 
natural law. "The voice of 
the conscience is not al- 
ways infallibale, not is it 
objectively supreme." 

This is a key point. 
Edmund Burke wrote that 
civilization is a "partner- 
ahip not only between those 
who are living, but between 
those who are dead, and those 
who are to be bom," A govern 
ment cannot allow each citi- 
zen Co choose which laws Co 
obey and which to disobey, 
for, given the diversity of 
consciences, chaos would re- 
■ suit and civlllzaCion would 
be destroyed. 

"The Trial of the Catons- 
vllle Nine" Is a stimulating 
and well-performed play. Its 
effectiveness results from 
the heroes being cloaked in 
the garb of the Catholic 
prleathood and basing their 
appeal largely on Christian 
rhetoric. 

However, defenders of 
the faith, be they Proteatants 
like myself or Catholics, can 
only condemn the actions of 
"Catonsvllle Nine" and warn 
viewera of the play not to 
be swept away by its 
emotionalism. 

But neither would orthodox 
Christians sgree with letter- 
writer Mike McKee who wrote, 
"I feel Jesus Christ would 
roll over in his grave at 
the tJTie of thing one of his 
mlntstere did," Contrary to 
suspicions aroused by "Super- 
star," Jesue Christ la not 
in Hia grave. He Is up in 
Heaven with God the FsCher 
and most of the angels.

Geologists to resume excavation 



IS are underway ii 
Geology Club in conjunction 
with the Geology Department 
to resume Spring excavation 
of the I-P mastodon, cwo- 
thirda of which currently 
reside in various nooks and 
crannlea In the Geology Lab. 

An ancient relative of the 
modern elephant, the maatodon 

bore a fairly close resemblancec^oiogy Club's project 
to its descendent when it thst occasion, 

roamed throughout north east- 
ern Indiana during the latter Free Uoiversilv 
■stage of the ice age some 10- 
15 thousand years ago. At 
some point of that era, the 
I-F mastodon, a two year old 
which had not reached adult- 
hood, met death from unknown 
cauaes and waa buried, over 
the couree of the years, be- 
neath the earth. 

There it reposed for cen- 
turies until Che bones were 
disturbed by a farmer digging 
a pond near Angola. Sensing 
that he had uncovered an un- 
usual and valuable find, the 
farmer, Crete Routsong, noti- 
fied Indiana University 
officlsls who in turn noti- 
fied the local campus geo- 
logy department. 

Intrigued by the pros- 
pect of conducting an exca- 
vation of the cite, the 
geology club and department 
undertook to resurrect the 
mastodon skeleton in the 
spring of 1969 and have been 



tate the spring digging. 

In the meantime, the I-p 
mastodon (or as much of it is 
available) Is being readied 
for its debute aa a display 
for the open houae to be 
held on campus Sunday, Febru- 
ary 13. Students and visitors 
are invited to view the masto- 
don and learn more i

Because of inadcrjuate

space difficulties con- 
fmnting the cafeteria vIU 
be alleviated by the utili-

Che Student Union. Cafe- 
teria facilities there 
will serve up to 13,000 
persons in addition to 
offering private dinners 
to specific groups meet- 
ing In roomfl off of the 
cafeteria 

While this process cuts 
production costs for the 
company, it decreases the 
variety of foods available 
to cafeteria patrons. 
However, in Its present 
cramped quarters, this I; 
the only choice accorded 
the cafeteria. 

Kitchen equipment, esti- 
mated to cost S10C,000,

Students from five state 
unlversltites testified be- 
fore the Public Policy com- 
mittee of the Indiana House 
of Representatives against 
the compulsory student 
activities fee. Partici- 
pating from Indiana-Purdue 
were Stan Jones, Mark Souder, 
and Hike Pfundstlen. 

Jones Issued a statement 
concerning the funding of 
politically biased speakers. 
It said In part: "If the 
students desire to see Ralph 
Nader or Paul Harvey or Jane 
Fonda or Abble Hoffman, let 
them choose to do so by 
paying the non-subsidized 
ticket price at the door. A 
well-chosen Convocations pro- 
gram can Bustaing Itself. 
If It can't. It doesn't de- 
serve the force of the state 
Co ram it down the students' 
throats." Jones Is Co-Chalr- 
man of the Indiana-Purdue 



Conv 



atlons Committee. 



Souder, in presenting the 

group's summary, also added 
a personal objection on 
religious grounds, speclflyin 
Superstar. The Killing " 
Sist 



George , and Cclebracloi 
His statement concluded: "If 
such trash must be allowed to 
appear on campus, I hardly 
think it's fair of the State 
of Indiana to force students 
to fund It or not be allowed 
to register st a state uni- 
versity. Please at least 
let the morally corrupt fund 
their own programs, and let 
Chose of us who treasure our 
principles use our money for 
things of which ue approve." 
The following resoltuion 
was Introduced in the House: 
WHEREAS m«Watory student 
activity fees at state- 
supported universities are 

6 



presently supporting radical 
and revolutionary groups and 
individuals through speakers' 
fees and direct payments , 
WHEREAS morally reprehensible 
programs of obscene content 
and questionable cultural 
value are consistently 
forced upon state university 
students whether they want 
them or not, 

WHEREAS a student cannot 
register unless these com- 
pulsory fees are paid, 
WHEREAS this, in effect, 
places the full force of the 
State of Indiana behind these 
compulsory fees in contra- 
diction to Che responsibility 
of the State of Indiana Co 
protect individual rights, 
THEREFORE we, the members 
of the Indiana General 
Assembly hereby request that 
any students' fees relating 
to non-academic activities 
be made optional and volun- 
tary for each individual 
student.

also lower on campus th.in

Cle.Tnlincss Is another 
big problem. The excess-

Hardly any college baakeC- 
ball team around has been 
nit by grade ineligibility 
le hard as Indiana-Purdue. 
First to be lost was Ktp 
Bailey, who was by far the 
leading scorer in the city 
college race through Decem- 
oer. Then Eugene Devbrow 
tost hie eligibility early 
In January, At that time he 
jas well up in the top ten 
In the city. 

The void was then -largely 
taken up by former Central 
standout Ty Bishop. But in 
Tild-January he, too, was lost 
through ineligibility. Like 
Devbrow, he was high in the 
city's top ten and was 
rising fast. 

Now John Powell has be- 
come the Tuskers' leading 
scorer, having amassed 262 
points In the first 20 games. 
Hla H.l average Is currently 
good for the lOth spot in 
the city college scoring 
rsce. Paul Jacquay, who was 
on the Injured list until 
about two weeks ago. Is also 
Starting Co Jell. 

Through last Tuesday the 
Tuskers held down the third 
spot In the city college 
stsndlnga , Indiana -Purdue 
Is also third in both 
offense and defense. It Is 
Interesting to note that 
last place Concordia (2-21) 
actually has a better offen- 
sive average than first place 
Bible College (17-2). The 
difference lies In the de- 
fense stats, which show chat 
Concordia gives up, on the 
average, 48 points more per 
contest than city rivsl 
Bible.

Basketball star Bill Russell 
to appear here VIonday 



One of Che great names of 
Che court sport — Bill Russell- 
comes Co the Indiana-Purdue 
Fort Wayne Campus Monday Feb. 
14 at 8 p.m. as guest speaker 
on the Campus Convocations 
Series. The former Boston 
Celtic player-cosch will dis- 
cuss "Go Up For Glory" which 
is based on his book of the 
same name. 

Tall, lean and congenial 
Bill Russell left his mark 
on Boston basketball history. 
In his 12 years with the 
Celts, he led his team to 
in world championships and 
became the first player- 
coach in Boston sports his- 
tory and the first of his race 
to be a full-Cime manager of 
a major sport. 

Sports Illustrated named 
him "Sportsman of the Year" 
In 1968 and In 1970 he was 
named "Athlete of the Decade.' 



But Bill Russell's In- 
terests are not confined 
solely to the basketbsll 
court, from which he Is now 
retired, for he Is also very 
much concerned with codsy's 
young scene. "This is the 
greatest college generation 
in this country's history," 
he claims, "because it has 
become involved In people." 

Both a fine sportsman and 
a dedicated citizen, the 
cage scsr often points out 
thst "This Is a great, great 
country--it can be even 
greater. , . For this country 
to be as great as It can be, 
I would die. , ." 

Tickets for Russell's 
address are available to the 
general public and may be 
obtained at the Office of 
Student Services on the 
'Indiana-Purdue Campus here.

Bend, 83-7&amp;. The Mastodons 
held an 18 point lead but a 
late cold spell cut their 
final margin to seven points. 

Balanced scoring played a 
big part In the Mastodon win, 
as they had five players in 
double figures. John Powell 
led all scorers with 23 points, 

Indians-Purdue's record now 
stands at 9-13. Tomorrow 
they visit Concordia College 
for an 8:00 contest. 



The Leo Mafia blew their 
first assignment. Only Tony 
Concadeluci showed any true 
Msfia shooting form, drilling 
In several pretty shots. 
Troxel's scrappy team of 
Hells County foreigners won 
47-45 by looking two points 
less less sick. Theli popu- 
lar center Phil Gagle has 
already earned a foul repu- 
tation, following his per- 
formances against the Mafia 
and in their losing battle 
against the Barnstormers. 
Phil snd their other re- 
bounder (who wears a Mickey 
House T-shirt) make s great 
pair. 

The opening loss was de- 
pressing. As John Wooden, 
coach of the great UCIA 
teams said: "Winning lan't 
everything, but losing Is 
nothing." 

Fortunately, the next game 
was against Circle K. Cir- 
cle K, picked as one of the 
pre-season weak sisters, ful- 
filled their esrly promise. 
Jerry Hetrick, the ladies' 
man from the Student Senate, 
made a few baskets, which 
made him stand out. Some 
of the other players weren't 
bad, like Jim Snelling, a 
Leo grad, and John Baker, 
who thinks he's a Isdles 
man; but, then again, most 
of the other players were 
bad. I mean, now really, 
when you've got to revive 
Bryan Quandc! 

I even got to play, and 
even worse, scored. The 
excitement overwhelmed me. 
You see, alley-ball players 
like myself aren't used to 
timeclocks with fancy 
colors. I watched, fascin- 
ated, as my two points were 



posted on the big board. 
Meanwhile Circle K was 
racing downcourt. Normally 
I would have had to bench 
myself for slothf ulness, 
but it, after all, being 
Circle K, they lost the 
ball out-of-bounds. 

In my two minutes of 
glory, I even humiliated 
poor Randy Stuckey by 
blocking hla only shot. I 
was flying high. All I 
needed was for some angelic 
voice to sing "Leaving on a 
Jet Plane." I wanted to 
buy the ball and keep it aa 
a trophy, but couldn't. Oh 
well, maybe there will be 
another Circle K and I'll 
score again. 

We won 73-39. 

Our next team was against 
Essex, the soul team. They 
cried Co out-psyche us In 
warm-ups. They practiced 
shooting Jump-shots from mid- 
court . The one guy's little 
kid could dribble better 
than I, But we weren't to 
be outdone. 

Tom Sebert messed up his 
hair which made him look 
tough despite hla baby-face. 
John Perkins wore his Gra- 
bill T-shlrc to scare them. 
And, of course, the whole 
team mlsaed their practice 
lay-ups to make Wilbur's 
team cocky. 

The game started out with 
some fancy ball-playing. 
Rick Stephenson and John 
Dunbar, realizing their team 
was not in shape, decided 
to conserve energy by 
acoring as soon as the bas- 
ket came within visibility 
range. But Che behlnd-the- 
back passing of Kim Cress, 
the hot hand of Steve 



' Marie Sourla- 

Bolller (a 19 point first 
half, missing only a lay- 
up), and the opponent's ex- 
haustion, broke the game 
open for the Mafia. 

The lead stretched to 
over thirty points when Stan 
Jones and I came in together 
to try and make it closer. 
Oble Booker came In for 
Essex to help demonstrate why 
politicians aren't in the 
NBA. 

The final waa 73-51. 

Intramural basketball 
may not quite compare, for 
sheer exclC^menC, to watching 
Spring Arbor beat the Haato- 
dons, but It iS' a nice viait 
to memory land. "Remember 
when so-and-so played for 
auch-and-such high achool. 
Boy could he hit, then." 

So If you desire to see 
some finesse, well, not 
really finesse; if you de- 
sire to see some, uh , sweat, 
yes sweat, come Co a stinking 
intramural basketball game 
any weeknighc from 7 Co 10.
