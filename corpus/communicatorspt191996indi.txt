Murder victim remembered 
by re-enactment of shooting 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

With the hopes of being able to 
help put an end to such acts of vio- 
lence. Stop the Madness and the 
Shannon Lutz Foundation, a non- 
profit organization formed to offer a 
reward for information leading to 
her killer, collaborated with Atlantis 
Entertainment 10 get Lutz's story 
onto film 

On Saturday, September 14, 
auditions were held for the Atlantis 
Entertainment public service 
announcement 

Adantis entertainment wanted 
40 aciors to re-enact the evenis of 



the April 28. 1995, shooting of 
Shannon Lulz. 

Lutz, a communication student 
was one of the first students to 
receive the honors certificate from 
IPFW. She also taught on campus 
for three years. 

Lutz was the victim of an appar- 
eni act of random violence. While 
sitting in her car at her South Wayne 
Avenue home, she was shot several 
limes by an unknown assailant 
Later (harevening, her husband, 
Andrew Lutz. returned home and 
found her in the still-running vehi- 
cle. 

Shannon died on her way to the 
hospital due to massive internal 



bleeding. 

The announcement will be simi- 
lar to the Stop the Madness one that 
was made in 1994. The 60-second 
commercial was a dramatized re- 
enactment of the Oct. 27, 1993, 
near-fatal shooting of Temae Jordan 
Jr. 

The announcement which is to 
be filmed next month in Fort Wayne, 
is planned to be aired on television 
and in movie theaters. It is meant to 
make audiences realize the impact 
of such random acts of violence and 
what they can do about it. 

The cast names and production 
dates have not yet been announced.

Multicultural services introduces programs 



Opportunity for students to become mentors 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

Students of all kinds have alter- 
native paths to lake in order to 
improve their understanding of the 
classes they are taking. Now, there 
are even more options for those who 
seek assistance 

Starling this fall semester, 
Multicultural Services initiated two 
programs that assist students in 
associate/ vocational programs 

The first program involves pro- 
viding supplemental education tech- 
niques. It helps students with cours- 
es traditionally seen difficult by stu- 
dents. 

"It docs not focus on the stu- 
dent," said Christine A. Patterson, 
director of Multicultural Services 



"It focuses on 
the class." 

Students arc 
recommended to 
stay for an extra 
hour of class in 
order to receive 
further instruc- 
tion. During the 
hour, students 
participate in an 
expert-directed 
group study and 
learn various techniques. In-depih 
conversations are also held on the 
classroom material and information 
which may not have been clarified 
during the general session. 

"The students leam to help 
themselves," said Patterson. 

According lo Patterson, the 




method of additional educational 
assistance has been proven national- 
ly to improve skills and raise grades. 

Courses in which the program is 
currently being offered are Biology 
203, Chemistry 111 and Math 109 

The second program is currently 
being called the Buddy Program. It 
involves aiding students in gelling 
acquainted with the Fort Wayne 
campus and/or community 

The Buddy Program teams up 
incoming freshmen with upper- 
classmen. The mentoring -like pro- 
gram is intended to show freshmen 
"the ropes." 

Eligible mentors must have a 
GPA of at least a 2.75 in order to 
participate 

Another new aspect is ihe fact 
that upperclassmen will now have 



the opportunity to have a communi- 
ty member as a mentor. According 
lo Patterson, this will give students 
an opportunity lo leam more about 
their chosen field through the 
thoughts and ideas of those actively 
participating in il. 

"This may give the student 
career ideas when they have some- 
one lo bounce around ideas with." 
said Patterson. 

Patterson feels that this could be 
a closer link with job opportunities 

"It's not always what a person 
knows." said Patterson. "It's often 
who the person knows." 

Both services are offered free lo 
all students. Those who are interest- 
ed may contact Multicultural 
Services for more information at 
481-6606 or 481-6921

Students often try to predict 
future evenis that may lake place on 
campus, yet few realize what has 
happened here in the pasl. 

On Sept. 21-29, IPFW will take 
part in Indiana's Archeology week. 
Under the direction of Robert J. 
Jeske. associate professor of anthro- 
pology, campus students will exca- 
vate a campsite on IPFW's property 
which is estimated to be 7,000 years 
old. 

Jeske will supervise some 
IPFW students as well as the 
Explorer Group on the excavation. 

According lo Jeske, the 
Explorer Group is a career -oriented 
organization that allows high school 
and college students, ages 16-21, to 
gain an understanding of what a 
professional job is like. 

"The idea of Archeology week 
is lo promote the ideals of preserva- 
tion and understanding of our past," 
Jeske said. "Many institutions 
around the slate arc doing a variety 
of events to bring our work to the 
public." 

Jeske and students will excavate 
the dune sile, which is believed lo 
be a seasonal campsite, located 
between the Gates Sports Center 
and Canterbury Green Apartments, 
on Sept. 21-22 from 12-4 p.m. 
Anyone interested is welcome to 
waich the open excavation. 

Jeske says ihat open excavation 
is to "...let people see what we do 
and to understand thai this campus 
has a significant amount of Native 
American pre-history to it — as 
well as the history of the campus 
itself." 

The same dune site was exca- 
vated in 1989 and 1991 during 
which time stone tools and debris 
from stone tools, such as flakes and 



chips were found. 

The artifacts that we found 
seem to date to about 7,000 to 5.000 
years ago," Jeske said 

He expects to find much of the 
same at the dune site but admits that 
it is quite possible to find new 
things at this excavation that 
weren't found in the previous ones. 

"It's a large sile and we've only 
begun to do the work on it; we've 
just done very small scale testing 
and this is a long term project." 
Jeske said. "This site has the poten- 
tial to answer some interesting 
questions about what was going on 
here in the past." 

On Sept. 27. Jeske, along with 
other arcbeologists from the state, 
will participate in Focal Day at the 
Indiana State Museum where arche- 
ologists will give public lectures on 
what was found in their particular 
area of the state. 

"We're hoping to gel a good 
turnout of students and (heir fami- 
lies," Jeske said. 

For more information, contact 
Jeske at 481-6842.

Journev to Diversitv 



L&lt;rtf*s wcrk tcgether 



by Paul Tupper 
Editor 

I had (be distinct honor of 
accompanying Jeanne T. Barone, 
instructor of communication; 
Richard Johnson, associate profes- 
sor of German, and other IPFW 
educators and staff, lo Indiana 
University Kokomo for "Enhancing 
Minority Attainment VI." a confer- 



ence dedicated to helping academia 
achieve diversity. I came back witb 
a great idea. But I'll get 10 that in a 
minute. 

Last school year, IPFW held its 
first Diversity Week I was one of 
two students involved in the plan- 
ning of that celebration, along with 
many staff, facully and administra- 
tion. Together, we pulled off what 
some called an impossible task. 




Catch Lani Guinier's take on ami 



action, next week. 



At ibis conference, we took our 
learned lessons hoping to snare our 
experiences with other campus 
leaders who were trying to coordi- 
nate their own celebrations. When 
we were done, we enjoyed other 
presentations, keynote speakers and 
panel discussions It was great to 
sec other campuses share our dedi- 
cation lo diversity 

Before I left for Kokomo, I 
decided to write an article sharing 
my experiences But 1 came back 
wanting to do more One article 
would not be enough 

I understand that to achieve 
diversity, we have lo open commu- 
nication on many occasions, not 
just during conferences or special 
weeks of celebration. With that in 
mind, I introduce "Journey to 
Diversity," a new weekly feature 
that will explore diverse topics 
This is where you come in. 

I would be glad to be the author 
of every "Journey to Diversity," but 
I'd rather noL 1 am hoping many of 
you on campus will join me in this 
effort, in any capacity. If you are an 
expert on a related topic (meaning 
you have some experience with thai 
topic or are a part of that group), I 
hope you will use this space as a 
medium to educate the campus. 

Perhaps you only have an idea 
of a subject you would like us to 
investigate, by all means, lei's work 
together. Let's plant a seed into the 
minds of those who don't under- 
stand what diversity means or why 
it pertains to them 

Maybe you would like to tell a 
story of what it is like to be of a dif- 
ferent ethnicity or religion in a 
while man's country, but you arc 
not confident enough of your wrii- 
ing skills to write ihe article. I 
would be glad lo sit with you and 
help you communicate your ideas 



and messages that you wish to con- 
vey. Don't lei your fear of writing 
stop you from sharing your unique 
perspective 

It is my goal lo explore the dif- 
ferent life experiences that can 
occur only when you are a "minori- 
ty." Teach us whai it is like to be a 
person with a disability. Explain to 
us why being a woman today still 
has its disadvantages Let's go into 
detail why being Asian is still frus- 
trating in this society Lei's expose 
truths and kill stereotypes. Let's 
answer questions many are afraid to 
ask. 

Ai the end of each article, I will 
be righting what I consider lo be a 
misfonunate wrong At ihe confer- 
ence, I noticed a lack of inclusion of 
sexual orientations during conver- 
sations and presentations When 
gays and lesbians where discussed, 
it was when campus representatives 
lold siories of how its diversity rev- 
olution began, which more often 
than not, started with gay students 
wanting recognition. This makes 
me sad. So after each topic, I will 
add my perspective as a gay man to 
each topic. Here, too, I invite others 
lo take pan in ihis experiment Wc 
all know mine is not the only gay 
opinion on this campus. Hopefully, 
gays will soon be included in every 
discussion regarding diversity, 

Please consider this your writ- 
ten invitation to change the world - 
your world. And with any luck, we 
will change the world for others as 
well.

Alternative means of transportation 



by Rebecca Koenlg 
StafT Writer 

Do you have an upcoming (est 
or a class where tardiness is an 
unforgivable sin? If so, you may 
want to consider being air lifted to 
class. 

It's odd that while the size of 
the parking lots remains the same, 
each year fewer spaces seem avail- 
able. Granted, some spaces were 
lost due to the construction of the 
new science building, but this year 
the situation seems worse than last. 
At least it seems worse while you're 
sprinting from the free parking lot 
all the way over to Kettlcr Hall, 
with 20 pounds of books at 8:56 
run for your 9 a.m class. 

Some people perhaps enjoy 
cruising the campus. For instance. 
some stud is probably smirking as 
be slicks back bis dark hair, think- 
ing, "Yep, I'll be leaving an hour 
early this morning. Bet that blonde 
girl will be walking through the 



parking lot by Engineering Tech 
just as I get to school." For those 
who miss ihe high school days of 
cruising, more power to you. 

For everyone else however, it is 
time lo consider alternative modes 
of trans porta lion. Notice tie num- 
ber of motorcycles lined up by Ihe 
library on any given day? Someone 
has thought through ihe parking sit- 
uation and real iced parking two 
wheels is easier than four. 

The roller blading ban could 
become an even larger issue here. 
Why limit our possibilities? We 
could all rollerblade lo campus and 
leave our cars at home. Students 
would probably be belter off. Of 
course some time would be lost gel- 
ling to campus but students could 
save the thirty minutes they now 
spend looking for a space Students 
would also benefii by saving money 
usually speni on attempts lo lose 
weight. 

In the morning, while aimlessly 
searching for a parking place, do 



you ever wonder about correspon- 
dence classes? Wouldn't it be easier 
to lake classes over the internei or 
through e-mail? You'd never have 
to look for a parking place. If your 
homework was nol done you could 
trade in thai old "my car blew up" 
slory for a modified version, "my 
RAM broke loose." Another added 
benefit is your classmates would 
never know if you attended class in 
your pajamas. 

We need to consider some son 
of alternative transportation lo cam- 
pus, ai least a car pool. Someone 
should buy one of those clown cars 
that holds 25 or 30 people. The guy 
on the bouom may not be happy, bui 
be won' t be lale lo class. 

Do all of ihe cars really belong 
here? Maybe it's an IVY Tech plot 
to convince students to transfer 
Think about it Late some night, 
they could have placed fake parking 
permits in old cars around campus 
By morning, many of the spois are 
filled. Then some sneaky person 



moves the cars around campus, just 
to confuse the campus police. It 
could happen. 

Maybe ihe besi way to find a 
parking spol is to bop Ihe curb and 
park on ihe grass rigbl in front of 
Ke tiler Considering the constant 
tickets, it would be cheaper to park 
in A or B lots, but you'd never have 
trouble finding a shady spot. 

Another possible solution could 
come from the professors Growl 
more ai your students. Don't actual- 
ly be mean, bul sound mean. 
Assign a 300-page paper in the syl- 
labus, insist it isn't a mistake After 
half the class drops, change your 
mind, make it a three-page paper. 

For your nexi car, don'l gel a 
Plymouth, Saium or Buick. Invest. 
Buy a tank. You'll be able to park ii 
anywhere you warn Better yet, buy 
a helicopter. You can park on Ihe 
roof of Keider and watch the cam- 
pus police try to give you a ticket.

Music Review: CAVEFISH 



by Rlchird Cueltar 
Staff Writer 

Friday night I walked into 
Columbia Street West for a quick 
beer I decided to walk to the back 
and sec if 1 spotted anyone 1 knew 
As I opened the door I heard a voice 
bellowing over the sound system. 

"OK, during the break we're 
going (o give away a pitcher of beer. 
If you come up and sign up for our 
newsletter we'll pick a name and the 
band will buy you a pitcher of beer," 
a member of the band said. 

Cool, where do 1 sign up I 
thought. Litde did I know that a 
week later I would be interviewing 
the voice and his band mates. 

Thai voice and his band mates 
belong to the band Cavefisb which 
consists of: Andy Leach (vocals), 
Patrick Madrid (guitar), Colin 
Lamont ("bass) and Eric Hemingcr 
(drums) 

This is Leach's first time in a 
professional band. The other mem- 
bers have some vocal talent and 
practice on stage for a song or two. 




places arc going to turn you down 
the first lime. Keep bugging them. 
Eventually they will appreciate the 
fact that you're persistent." Madrid 
said. 

"Don't just play stuff you like. 

Try to play something that people 

want to hear Not that we know 

- Hemingcr is the most experienced evervlnmgi bu t a lot of bands make 



band member. He has been playing 
seriously in bands for the past ten 
years. Lamont and Madrid have 
been playing in bands for about six 
years This is the simple story of 
bow they met: 

"Myself and our old singer had 
a band before Cavelish called 
Raghead We just played parties 
and stuff and we were looking for a 
bass player and drummer," remem- 
bers Madrid. "I already knew Colin 
and he knew Eric so we all kind of 
met that way And later we met 
Andy at IPFW" 

So why the name Caveftsh? I 
think Lamont and Madrid explain it 
best: 

"It was basically blurted out and 
was accepted before we voted on it 
or thought to hard about it It bit us 
alright so I guess we took it," 
Lamont explains. 

"It doesn't really categorize us 
as one thing, you know. It leaves us 
room to grow, I guess. No one's 
going to say 'Well they must be a 
country band or whatever.' or '1 
don't like them,' or I hate them,' 
before they even listen to us," adds 
Madrid. 

"I guess there's no real meaning 
behind the name," Lamont said. 

Ask any fan who signs up for 
their newsletter and they will tell 
you Cavefish equals great music. 
The newsletter lets you know when 
the band is performing Eventually 
they hope to have a home page on 
the internet, but for now they it's a 
slow process 

Since Cavefish tours extensive- 
ly you can see them in such 
Midwest cities as Cincinnati, 
Toledo. Indianapolis, South Bend 
and Lafayette But all roads lead 
back to their home base of Fort 
Wayne 

"fWc would] like to eventually 
get into Louisville and Chicago. Up 
into Michigan a little bit too 
Mostly, it'll be primarily the 
Midwest," said Heminger. 

"If we can't drive there I'm not 
playing there." adds Leacby, in a 
satirical voice. 

"They'll nave to pay to fly us to 
go to different places," Madrid said 

The band is bard at work com- 
posing original songs and hopes that 
a major record company will sign 
diem i'ii Thus far they have ten 
originals on paper now with hopes 
of recording them onto CD and 
releasing them by late winter. 

"We'll try to write maybe 20 or 
25 good originals and take the best 
10 or 12 and put them on the first 
CD." Madrid said. 

But until then, tbey will contin- 
ue to cover a mixture of current 
alternative rock along with some 
bits from the eighties and a few 
older tunes Some example of 
music they play includes RF..M., 
U2. The Replacements, Elvis 
Costello. and Stone Temple Pilots 
For good measure they slip in seme 
originals to gauge audience reac- 
tion. Cavefisb offered this 
advice to the next generation of 
rockers, "Have a lot of patience and 
practice That's the main reason 
we're playing good [together] now." 
advises Heminger. "When you try to 
get people to book you. a lot of 



the mistake of bickering amongst 
themselves. Making song lists of 
songs that they like Maybe 15 or 
20 people out there might like it but 
the other 90 might not So even if 
your sick of the song, play it for the 
audience because that's who is 



enjoying the show," added Leach. 

"The big thing you'll find on 
our stage is that we tend to have a 
lot of fun together. And we're jok- 
ing a lot. Whether you know it or 
not we're having a lot of fun. We're 
smiling. We're laughing We're 
pushing each other. We're trying to 
tnp each other We'll stand on each 
others feet. We don't get overly 
critical if we happen to mess up. As 
long as we're having fun and the 
crowd is having fun, that's the most 
important thing Our energy shows 
and we relate to the crowd," con- 
cluded Colin 



Student organization 
incorporates school with work 



by Ca&amp;sle Ritler 
Features Editor 

Have you been wondering 
which student organization to join? 
Which one is the right one for you? 
Well if you want to find a way to 
incorporate school with work, then 
the Society for Human Resources 
Management (SHRM) is the organi- 
zation for you 

SHRM is a student organization 
at IPFW that offers guidance for 
those interested in human resources/ 
personnel According to Karen 
Favory. co-president of SHRM, 
SHRM has a lot to offer students. 

The organ izau on offers compa- 
ny tours, a shadowing program and 
a national membership. 

The shadowing program match- 
es a student up with someone who is 
in a personnel department in the 
professional field. 

"It's good for freshmen who 
need to figure out what they want to 
do. and for seniors who need to fig- 
ure out what they want to specialize 
in," Favory said. 

The national SHRM can be 
joined for S35, and according to 
Favory it offers many benefits to 
students. 

"There arc a lot of scholarships 
and grants to be had in this pro- 



gram," Favory said. "The best pan 
of the national membership is the 
networking." 

In any event, it's a good way to 
mingle with those in the profession- 
al fields and possibly better your 
chance at getting the job you want. 

"There are a loi of jobs to be had 
out there in human resources," 
Favory said. It's just a matter of 
finding them. For more information 
please call 481-6420.

Senate mistakenly 
legislates morality 



Last week, the Senate debated 
the "morality" of gay mar- 
riage. On C-Span, Senators 
were seen quoting from Tbe Bible 

The issue was brought to the 
Senate floor in a move to invalidate 
an effort in Hawaii (hat seeks to 
legalize same sex marriages. 

What this measure has done is 
prove the hypocrisy of those wbo 
preach "family values ." The Senate 
has taken a stand against stability in 
relationships while at the same time 
screaming 
against promts- 
cutty and adul- 
tery 

Alio 
same sex 
riages would let 
many homosex- 
uals live tbe life 
they have want- 
ed — a monoga- 
mous relation- 
ship with some- 
one they love. 
No longer 

would gays 
marry a woman 
whom they may 
have been in 
love with but 

did not connect 

to in a physical 

or emotional way. No longer would 

lesbians be forced to live their life 

with a man who could not provide 

the environment they needed to 

grow. 

Because of the Senate's 
actions, homosexuals will be forced 
to deny themselves and live a false 
life. The Senate's move toward 



"J. The Senate 

HAS TAKEN A 

STAND 

AGAINST 

STABILITY IN 

RELATIONSHIPS 



"legislated morality" has once 
again proved they are out of touch 
with most of America. 

Most of America docs not 
approve of same sex marriage, but 
most Americans live their life in a 
"live and let live" philosophy. The 
straight people who are bothered by 
homosexuality would not associate 
with the married gay couples The 
straight people wbo are comfort- 
able with homosexuality would 
welcome the marriage with a cele- 
bration. 

Isn't that what 
marriage is sup- 
posed to be any- 
way — A celebra- 
tion of two people 
who decide to 
share their lives, 
futures and them- 
selves? 
Governments 
should not have 
the authority to 
legislate how peo- 
ple Live their lives, 
Nearly all attempts 
to legislate morali- 
ty have failed in 
the past and this 
one is probably 
doomed for failure 



too. 

That does not lessen our out- 
rage at the short-sighted, homopho- 
bic actions of The Senate When 
will legislators realize that we sent 
(hem there to serve the country, not 
to decide how we live our lives. 

That's our decision. Leave it to

"Woe to you

A lawyer fell into the shark- 
infested waters while on a 
Caribbean vacation. A 
school of sharks was about to eat 
him fast, but decided against it when 
they figured out what he was. 

They were displaying profes- 
sional courtesy.

majors. While it 
was unlawful to 
heal a sick per- 
son on the 
Sabbath (a rest 
day lo the Jews) 
or eat with tbe 
wrong crowd, 
they plotted to 
kill. 

Jesus 
said to those 
leaders: 

You give a tenth 
,. But you have 
neglected tbe more important mat- 
ters of the law - justice, mercy and 
faithfulness." (Matthew 23:2-4. 23. 
24) 

Not coinc tdentaliy. one of the 
majors left out of today's culture is 
God's Word. Generations past knew 



it a couple of years back, it's fun and 
it's fair. The class of people who are 
supposed to work for the public's 
greater good actually make it worse. 
While the joke is rather light- 
hearted, it reveals an underlying 
sentiment held by 
myself and a large 
pan of the general 
public against the 
legal profession as a 
whole. The focus 
here will not be mem-

members of the 
bench, who at one

NOT JUST 
FINDING PEACE 



The Constitution's framers believed 
from tbe first paragraph that "man is 
endowed by its creator with certain 
inalienable rights." many of which 
were derived from The Bible The 
Bible banned from today's educa- 
tional system under 
thai same, sadly mis-

These people. 
from the Supreme 
Court on down, have 
led ibis nation into a moral free fall 
whose consequences are staggering 
and whose direction is ominous 

It should hardly surprise the 
public that our educational systems 
and our public policy reflect god- 
lessness and a lack of either true 
value or effectiveness when the peo- 
ple in control disavow any notion of 
a God who is to be answered to and 
whose laws remain supreme (any- 
one ever heard of natural law?). 

These same individuals who 
have thrust God out of the schools 
and replaced absolute law with ill- 
defined "values education" have 
laid upon the citizenry a massive 
legal structure where nobody is truly 
sure when they are law-abiding citi- 
zens Need convincing? Take a look 
at our tax laws and the NCAA. 

This situation is strangely simi-

leaders of the day were accused of

Journalist and 
__^^_^^_ politician Horace 
Greeley said "It is impossible to 
mentally or socially enslave a Bible- 
reading people ." 

He understood what was funda- 
mental to a society's longevity and 
success back in 1857. but nght now, 
we're seriously missing it, folks. 

We need a return to true basics, 
not just finding peace with our inner 
selves (which we have serious trou- 
ble doing, anyway) or trying to 
"define one's own concept of exis- 
tence, or meaning, of the universe, 
and of the mystery of human life." 
(Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 
1992). This nation needs the 
answers to tough moral questions, 
the accoun lability of our leadership 
and the purpose of human existence 
which God provides to us 

Without it we are destined to 
become yet another of tbe great 
trees in tbe forest: it could withstand 
any outside attack, but it rotted from 
within.

what I'm given. 
Therefore, I 
must assume 
that upon 

beginning an 
envelope-stuff- 



ing 



I 



One day last week 1 was look- 
ing through the Help 
Wanted section, trying to 
find a position to support me. my 
wife and our four young Guaranteed 
Student Loans. Hidden among ads 
for telemarketing work and other 
forms of capital punishment was the 
following gem: 

"Earn up to S1.000 weekly, 
stuffing envelopes at home Be your 
boss. Start now. No experience. Few 
supplies, free information. No 
obligation.'' 

This immediately had me ask- 
ing all sorts of questions. 

Since I hardly know where to 
begin. I'll start with the first sen- 
tence; specifically, the "$1,000 
weekly" business. Simple mathe- 
matics will tell you that a person 
grossing one thousand dollars a 
week will net. roughly, forty thou- 
sand dollars a year (1 should point 
out that the ad actually says "up to 
$1,000 weekly." so only the really 
gifted envelope stutters make that 
kind of dough. Still I must contin- 
ue). Now 1 don't know about you. 
but 1 know a few people who make 
forty grand a year, and not one stuffs 
envelopes for a living. They are 
directors of risk management, sys- 
tems analysis and cost accountants. 
but there is not an envelope stuffer 
in the bunch 

This really surprises me. how- 
ever, because envelope stuffing 
seems like a pretty easy way to 
make a buck (sure it's drudgery, but 
cost accounting isn't exactly Mardi 
Gras either) I would think that if 
this S 1 ,000 figure were accurate, the 
directors of nsk management and 
systems analysis of the world would 
be knocking each other out of the 
way to line up for envelope-stuffing 
jobs. But seeing this isn't even com- 
mon among the chambermaids and 
laundromat attendants of the world, 
I'm led to believe thai it might be a 
bit of an exaggeration. 

I'm also skeptical. I must con- 
fess, about the promise made in the 
second sentence of the ad: "Be your 
boss." 1 suppose they meant to say 
"Be your OWN boss," but I can 



ould transmu- 
tate, transmo- 
grify or other- 
wise transform 
into one of my 
former employ- 
ers And since most of my former 
employers have been female, I can 
only imagine that this would be a lot 
like the movie "Switch" (a film 
from a few years ago which starred 
Jimmy "Boy. I've been in some ter- 
rible movies" Smits and Ellen "1 
look like Angle Dickenson — And 
she's about 75" Barkin) This being 
the case, I would spend the bulk of 
my time stumbling around in high 
heels and bending down to give the 
world gratuitous peeks at my cleav- 
age, which would leave very little 
time for stuffing envelopes 

After taking the phrase "Be 
your boss" literally, I suppose I 
should also take that which suc- 
ceeds at face value. 1 should point 
out (hat "no experience" could be 
short for a lot of things, including: 

A Only someone with "no 
experience" dealing with employ- 
ment scams would never answer 
this ad. 

B. Our company has absolutely 
"no experience" in the envelope- 
stuffing business. 

But I'm not going to do that. 
Instead, I'll be generous and assume 
they mean "no experience NECES- 
SARY." Nevertheless this also pre- 
sents some problems. 

I consider myself to be an aver- 
age American, envelope stuffing- 
wise and I've been stuffing 
envelopes for over 15 years. This is 
a skill you can't avoid acquiring. I 
think they're going to gel experi- 
enced envelope stuffers whether 
they want them or not Simply mail- 
ing for the "free information" in this 
advertisement would take some 
basic envelope-stuffing experience. 
Inviting those with no experience to 
answer their ad is just asking for 
trouble 

Instead, maybe they should go 
afier experienced envelope stuffers 
who are looking to improve their 
lot There's goi to be a few veterans 
of the trade out there who would 
love the opportunity to be their 
boss. Especially the ones wbo only 
make eight or nine hundred dollars a 
week.

Soccer team scares Marquette 



by S. Branl Kelley 
Sports Editor 

Tbc 1PFW men's soccer leam 
came oh-so-close lo a historic upset 
last Sunday night at the Three 
River's Classic But almost only 
counts in horseshoes and band 
grenades 

Against Marquette University, 
the Mastodons almost hit tbc pin 
with (he footwear Down 2-0 early 
in the second hair, all-loumey .selec- 
tion Mike Harper drove home a 
penalty kick with 24:58 left, and 
only a great save by Marquette 
goalie Loukas Papaconsiantinou in 
the final minute kept the 'Dons from 
recording their greaiesi upset ever 



The previous night, the 
Mastodons got blown apart by the 
University of Alabama- 

Birmingham, 8-0. They began tenta- 
tively against their most powerful 
opponent ever and it set the tone for 
most of the match 

Reacting rather than anticipat- 
ing, the 'Dons found themselves 
down by three goals less than ten 
minutes into lie match The Blazers 
followed with two more goals dur- 
ing the first half and walked into (be 
locker room leading 5-0. 

With nothing left to lose, IPFW 
began the second hall' with reckless 
abandon and played wilh the 
Blazers for half an hour Then 
fatigue and morale caught up with 




the Mastodons as they gave up three 
more goals in the final 15 minutes. 

"We got caught on our heels and 
didn't play wilh any intensity," 
IPFW coach Terry Stefankiewicz 
said "In the second half, we played 
pretty much equal to tbem " 

During Saturday's second 
match. Indiana University squeaked 
past Marquette University, 3-2, in 
two overtimes Tied 1-1 at the end 
of regulation, both teams scored 
again within the first minute, cheat- 
ing anyone who took a potty break 
or bought popcorn The Hoosiers 
scored twelve minutes later on a far- 
post header to seal the outcome 

Sunday's first match was a face- 
off between Saturday's winners, and 
lU tied UAB 1-1. The Blazers won 
the Classic title because (hey scored 
a greater number of goals, inflated 
by their Ihumping of IPFW 

Not satisfied with their one- 
sided demise to UAB a night earlier, 
the Mastodons displayed a new 
level of grit and determination 
against Marquette 

"That [the loss to UAB) set (he 
tone for the second night," 
Stefankiewicz said. 

Consistently winning 50-50 
balls and playing in the Golden 
Eagles' half of the field, IPFW 
played well enough lo stick with 
Marquette and entertain thoughts of 
an upsei with less than a minute left 
in the game. 

Stefankiewicz said the 'Dons 
rose to a higher level of play during 
the match and gave him high hopes 
for the rest of the season. 



"1 lold the kids, 'If you play like 
this. I know we can win the champi- 
onship,'" be said. "It was a tremen- 
dous, tremendous turnaround ... We 
definitely need to build upon that ." 

Goalkeeper Mall Schmitz rose 
with the resl of the squad, even after 
IPFW lost sweeper Ben Trevino lo a 
red card just 23 minutes into the 
match. 

"Thai's the best I've seen him 
lake control in the enure time I've 
seen him play," Stefankiewicz said. 

Both nights, many of Fori 
Wayne's finest attended, including 
Mayor Helmke, but only 1500 spec- 
tators passed through the gates. 
leaving IPFW's athletic department 
with a dry taste in its mouth 

"It is disappointing." 
Stefankiewicz said "The evening 
wasn't rainy It was a great night for 
soccer"

IPFW hosts long-awaited 
cross country meet 



by S. Brant Kclky 
Sports Editor 

In its first borne meet in four 
years, IPFW's cross country teams 
showed Improvement and re-intro- 
duced Fort Wayne to Masiodon run- 
ning 

"Everything went well," IPFW 
cross-country coach Judy 
Tillapaugb said "It was just a totaJ 
success." 

The IPFW Invitational pitted 14 
women's teams and 13 men's learns 
against its newly redesigned course. 
which placed more distance near the 
Coliseum Blvd -side or the campus 

"[Saturday] was a way of show- 
casing our new course," Tillapaugb 



said "It just made for a nicer 
course." 

Both the men's and women's 
teams showed improving times, 
despite a brisk wind from the west 
which made running parallel to 
Coliseum brutal. 

"They had a pretty strong bead- 
wind going west from the east at 
Crescent toward the entrance of the 
campus," Tillapaugb said. 

The men, led by freshman Steve 
Tcusch, placed fifth out of thirteen 
teams Teusch placed eighth and ran 
in second for part of the race Adam 
Barton and Chad Clevingcr also 
placed in the top 30 ai 2 1 st and 28th, 
respectively. 

The women placed sixth out of 



14 teams Kay Pulver led the way 
with a seventh-place finish and a 20 
minute, 2-secondtime 

Alma College of Michigan won 
both the men's and women's races. 

Tillapaugh said she was 
impressed with both teams' 
improvement. 

"I see them working better as a 
team." she said. "[And) 1 feel our 
best times are ahead of them " 

With the public exposure, 
Tillapaugh said she hopes more stu- 
dents will want lo participate on the 
team: "As we get more visibility as 
a team ... I'm hoping we can inspire 
more I1PFW] runners to compete 
again" 



Yankee's still the best (almost) 




The New York Yankees started the season as a team 
many picked to challenge for the American League East 
championship The season started off well and in a 
series with the Baltimore Orioles after the All-Star 
break, the Yankees were sitting on top of the East with 
an 11-game lead But the Yankees built that lead with a 
strong pitching staff lead by Andy Petdlte and Dwigbt 
Gooden. Yet good pitching doesn't last forever, which is 
the reason Yankees owner George Steinbrenner added 
two power hitters to the team roster. 

However most observers are quick to assign blame 
to Steinbrenner for trading with the Detroit Tigers for 



Cecil Fielder and signing Darryl Strawberry, assuming 
these moves ruined Yankee team chemistry and caused 
bad pitching I feel this team just so happened to have 
picked August to have its slump, the worst time in the 
season 

The pitchers have lei the team down in the last 
month, but once the playoffs start the Yankee pitchers 
should piicb betier Getting once-injured David Cone 
back into rotation will provide the team with an excel- 
lent boost. 

This isn't a collapse by any stretch of the imagina- 
tion. Not when the Orioles are playing their best ball of 
the year at a time when the Yankees are playing their 
worst. The aquisiuon of the two above players will be 
better understood once the playoffs start. 

Of course, I am assuming the Yankees will make the 
playoffs, which they will, unless by some freak accident 
they lose the rest of their games The Yankees are the 
top team in the American League, if not the majors. 
Once the pitchers get back on track lo complement an 
offense capable of putting up big numbers, the Yankees 
will add another banner to the bouse Ruth built 

On the other hand, the Yankees could gel swepl 
away by the Cleveland Indians four slraigbt in the AL 
Championship series. Who really knows how the season 
will play out? So take it for what it's worth. 



Volleydons come of age; 
prepare for GLVC season 

Upset of Grand Valley State sets tone for weekend 



by S. Brant Kelley 
Sports Editor 

When ii rains, it pours, and 
when the sun shines, it soars. 

So must have been the senti- 
ments of IPFW women's volleyball 
coach Tim Heffron last week as the 
Volleydons erased the memories of 
the two previous weekends with 
three straight wins, including a 
three-game sweep of llth-rankcd 
Grand Valley Stale University last 
Thursday night. 

"Basically, we played real 
well." Heffron said of the GVSU 
match. "The key was we played real 
well in crunch time and they didn't. 

"In the past ... psychologically, 
we have not pushed over the top." 
be said. "It was nice lo push over the 
lop [this time]." 

After starting the first game 
with a 7-1 deficit, the Volleydons 
went on a six-point roar and finished 
ihe first game 15-13. The second 
game was much of the same as the 
Lakers scored the first four points 
Like the previous game, however. 
the 'Dons awoke from their slumber 
and took the lead, this lime for the 
rest of the match. 

"Tbey had trouble doing what 
we did," Heffron said. "We were 
definitely the aggressor ... as a

result, they were trying to react 
rather than create." 

Beginning in the middle of the 
second game, IPFW went to the 
most potent pan of its offense: the 
middle attack. Led by Andi Reichart 
and Doitie Porch with 12 kills 
apiece, the 'Dons dominaled the 
middle and sealed the rcsl of the 
match for their biggest win in years, 
15-13. 15-13. 15-11. 

On Friday and Saturday, the 
Volleydons opened the Great Lakes 
Valley Conference season with 
matches at Kentucky Wesleyan 
University and the University of 
Southern Indiana 

Heffron made liberal use of his 
reserves ai KWU as the 'Dons 
pulled away with a 15-2. 15-7. 15-8 
victory. 

"We go down there (Kentucky 
Wesleyan] expecting a win in three 
games," Heffron said. "Some of our 
reserves were a little shaky, [but] we 
played well enough to win." 

IPFW squeaked past a scrappy 
USI squad on Saturday night to gar- 
ner its third victory in three nights 
With two matches already past on 
the road trip, Heffron said he 
thought his team was tired. 

"We looked very tentative ... 
very tired," he said. "We kept kind 
of waiting for them to collapse, and 



it didn't happen " 

After falling behind 7-1 in the 
first game, the 'Dons came back and 
won 15-10. They won the second 
game, 15-9, but all was not in band. 
IPFW jumped out lo an 8-1 lead to 
start the third game and promptly 
allowed USI to dominate the rest of 
thai game and win. 15-9. 

IPFW lost the fourth game. 15- 
12. to force a deciding fifth game. 
The final game appeared to be more 
of the same as the Volleydons fell 
behind, 8-4. But they finished the 
game, scoring 11 of the next 13 
points to win the maich and begin 
ihe GLVC season with a 2-0 mark. 
Heffron said he was not surprised 
USI gave his team a run. 

"USI bas always been a very 
scrappy team," he said. They came 
through at their end of it"
