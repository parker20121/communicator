TORNAD02" 

There is hardly a sight in nature more awesome or terrifying than a funnel cloud. 
In its brief life, a tornado has an enormous potential for destruction. 



How a tornado forms 



© 



Tornadoes are extremely violent, small storms of rapidly rotating winds. They lorm 
when cool, dry air clashes with warm, humid air, creating powerful thunderstorms. 

IAlhunderslorm creates updrafts and warm humid air rises rapidly. More warm 
air rushes in to replace it. 

I Uppor level winds provide a suction over the top ol the storm. 




Where do tornadoes occur? 
Tornadoes occur all over trie world, but the 
continental Plains ol North America are 
most lavorabte tor their lormallon. Warm, 
moist air pushing up Irom I fie Gull ot 
Mexico and cold, dry air moving east Irom 
the Rocky Mountains holp gonerate the 
slofms- Since 1950, the average number 
ol lornadoos hitting the United States per 
year is 700. 



Characteristics of a tornado 



Updraft overshoot 

tUpper winds 




n an extremely powerful thunderstorm, the 
combination of the updrafts and the Earth's 
rotation begins the spinning motion of the storm. 
The rotating air extends down Irom the cloud, 
forming a tornado. 







The tunnel usually is white when il descends. 
Updrafts cause water vapor inside the funnel to 
condense, making it darker. Oust and other 
ground debris cause it to darken more. 



Tornadoes may occur at any lime but 
most lorm during the warmest hours 
of the day. 82 percent occur between 
noon and midnight. 23 percent occur 
between 4 and 6 p.m. 
Tornadoes usually travel southwest 
lo northeast. 

They travel at 25-40 mph. 
Winds may blow up to 350 mph. 
Winds whirl in a counterclockwise 
direction In northern hemisphere, 
clockwise In southern hemisphere. 

When and where tornadoes 
are most likely to form: 
February: Central Gull States 
March-April: Southeast Atlantic 
stales (including Florida) 
May: Southern Plains states 
June: Northern Plains; Great Lakes 
and western New &gt;brk State

prayers of "you're not hungry" were 
offered up to this doctor. It was debated 
lo go so far as to create a human block- 
ade. The doctor has to sec us now— he, 
at least, had breakfast. A second doctor 
arrived lo assist in completion of our

This worst part of the physical was 
yet to come. We had to strip down for 
the "tum-your-hcad-and-cough" rupture 
test. For some strange reason the consti- 
tution came to mind during this test, 
especially the pari that states. "AH men 
arc created equal and endowed by their 
creator..,," It looked like some of these 
guys had been short changed. 

As we were being checked for hem- 
orrhoids, the doctor could feel our 
apprehension growing. He was going 
where no man bad gone before. When 
he completed the test, I felt as used as a 
proctologist's glove.

Coming Out 

When one comes out, prepare for the worst 



By Paul Tuppcr 

Staff Columnist 

Revealing your homosexuality lo 
your parents is probably the most deli- 
cate stage of coming out. Having gay 
children is a fear of most parents. 
Think about it; when you were asked 
as a child to tell what you wanted to be 
when you grew up, I bet you never said 






inted t 



/ up t 



s gay. 



From conception, parents envision 

their children maturing lo be doctors, 
lawyers, teachers, or even professional 
athletes or entertainers, but never 
homosexuals. 

I am not sure that I am qualified lo 
give specific instructions lo every sin- 
gle person wanting lo come out to their 



parents, but here arc a few personal 
observations I have made. 

1) Be ready for your parents to 
reject you. This does not happen in 
most cases, but be ready in case it 
docs. If you arc being supported by 
them financially, I advise wailing until 
you can support yourself. 

2) Don't come out during a defen- 
sive rage I have seen this many limes. 
Gays will tell Ihcir parents of their ori- 
entation while in a heated argument. 
This will only cause more tension and 
will not help anyone win the argument. 

3) Make information available lo 
your parents when coming out, Any 
library in town is full of information 
regarding coming out and homosexual- 
ity. Give your parents research material 



(printed or video) thai will help them 
come to terms with your sexuality. 

4) Remember your intentions. 
Coming out to your parents should be 
for your sake only. Do it because it is 
time for YOU and right for YOU. 

Remember that you are important. 
If it would hurt you to sec your parents 
in pain over this, then don't do it But 
moke the decision yourself. 

If your parents arc like mine, it will 
lake some time before they fully accept 
you. But hopefully they will love you 
as much as mine docs me.

Will North Korea's racial 
pride cause its downfall? 



By Michael Workma 
Staff Columnist 



As disheartening as it may sound 
North Korea seems lo be very focused 
on the idea of ignoring 
the nuclear non-prolifera- 
tion treaties, and the 
development on their 
own engines of mass 
destruction appears quite 
imminent. Sanctions

the Chinese, and the U.S. 
apparenUy intends to pur- 
sue this option separate 
from the rest of the 
world's policymakers. It 
is common knowledge by 
now that North Korea 
will consider any form of 
sanctions an act of war. 
but Clinton and other 
leaders are unwilling lo 
rule out military solutions 
where the Pyongyang 
party is concerned. It is 
said that Ibis decision is 
made due to the unbal- 
anced mentality and 
unpredictability of the 

South Korean presi- 
dent Kim Young Sam

Clinton's initiative and 
confirmed bis position on 
the phone with the presi- 
dent. Meanwhile. North 
Korean military officials 
are wooing Chinese 
diplomats in an attempt lo 
sway their opinion at the 
policy making table. 

The root of all these 
problems is North Korea's reluctance lo 
allow United Nations inspector? into 
their nuclear facilities. What these 
inspectors intended to do was work like 
archaeologists and decide from what 
was remaining in the 'downsized' 
power planls whether or not adequate

high and Ihc city itself could be 
expected lo be reduced (o rubble 
inside of a week. 

Truth be told, the economic sanc- 
tions which Clinton proposes lo 
impose arc something that the father 
and sou Kims running North Korea 
are hardly worried about. Economic 
pressure is almost always more effec- 
tive on allies rather than enemies, as 
was the case when (he U.S. utilized 
them lo force Iho French and British 
from the Suez Canal. But when deal* 
ing with totalitarian governments like 
North Korea, they're more likely to 
scoff than cringe. As with the uim.ni 
situation in Haiti, for example the 
government there isn't interested in 
what effect the economic turmoil will 
have on their citizens and arc likely 
to overflow their coffers with the 
money made from trafficking in the 
bootlegging of life-sustaining and 
necessary supplies. The black market 
is a gold mine to oppressive regimes. 
People living under such structures 
tend to support their governments as 
a matter of racial pride rather than 
give in lo the pressures of outsiders.

and North Korea's Ihv 

nose at the world's leaders, war will 

eventually ensue to prevent the pro' 

liferetion of their nuclear devicesand 

to prevent the sale of such knowledge 

lo other aggressor nations. 

So what seems lo be the right 
answer? North Korea will definitely 
resist dictation from the U.S. or any 
other country. In the past, the United 
Nations and America have allowed 
the proliferation of such arms, as 
With China, Russia and France, due 
lo unmistakable barriers of every

It comes down to the same simple 
points. Is North Korea willing to 
destroy itself by committing the first 
maniacal step towards nuclear war? 
China docsn'l seem to think so and 
they're within reach of Kim II Sung's

On the road with Michael Workman 



Mall Secruity: 
Naked Gun 3 
or Ratnbo... 



You're shopping It'i Olcnbrook 
mall and everything look* so appeal- 
ing, from ihe irinkelt thai thine so 
beautifully in the lighl Io the stereos 
a/id VCR'l, ah, so lovely. 

You hove no cash. It's luckvillc 
eneepl you wanl thai shirt from Ihc 
Gap io bad you can taste il. And 



i there 



you 



shouldn't haw it? No 
Be*idc«, you're a hardworking stiff 
who pays bis taxes and, anyway, 
Ihese jerks have insurance. They 
won't miss n thing. 

So that shirt gets stealthily 
deposited in your pocket. You're so 
cool, you think, and head for the 
nearest exit like any smart thief, But 
■here'* something blocking your 
way. You look closely and spy a 
gleaming badge reflecting in the sun- 
light. It's mall security and you're 

When I was about twelve, mom 
and dad would drop my brother and 
me off at Glenbrook shopping mall 
with a whole blazing two bucks and 
instructions to make it last the whole 
day — two whole shitty bucks! 

So we'd buy a comic book and 
then use the bag to steal slufr. We 
ripped tbe moll off blind. Whecc was 
mall security then? I don't know, but I 
had loads of comics and toys to flaunt 
when I got home thai night stealthily 
deposited in the mony pockets of my 
coal My parents would never suspect. 

Wc were way cool until we storied 
feeling guilty, which lasts about ten 
minutes when you're a kid. Stealing 
stuff is cool when you're a kid and 
sucks mightily when you get caught. 
But it always seemed like Ihe only 
people mall security caught were the 
occasional dope smoker in the bath- 
room or some other idiot who was 
stupid enough to hoist an entertain- 



ment center up onto his shoulders and 
stroll out like Superman in front of 
god and grandma. 

What then, you might ask. is the 
polnl "I mJI security'' To take a bul- 
let when some maniac strolls into Ihe 
mall with in Uzi to hunt humans? 
Doubtful. Cathy Nafer. head of securi- 
ty for Glenbrook mall, says lhal the 
security oflier'i role is to provide "a 
calm and peaceful atmosphere so that 
ihe customers can enjoy their shop- 
ping experience on the property." The 
main way they do thai is by merely 
being vliible, 

If there's a crime in progress, such 

"When I was about 
twelve, mom and dad 
would drop my brother 
and me off at Glenbrook 
shopping mall with a 
whole blazing two bucks 
and instructions to make 
it last the whole day - two 
whole shitty bucks!" 



as shoplifting, it's the responsibility of 
the store to arTest the offender. 

Glenbrook security will arrest an 
offender, but the crime falls under the 
jurisdiction of the Fort Wayne Police 
Department. 

Other than that, mall security deals 
with sick folks and life-safety situa- 
tions like tornado evacuations, etc, 
Seems Ibcir biggest thing is putting 
out cigarettes and trying to pick up 
sixteen year olds. 

These big, bad, bard corps guards 



and a few off-duty officers are there 
for the public peace. Consider it JC 
Penney's secret service. They watch 
They wait. Tbey tackle. In all sinceri- 
ty, I never really see them. There's 
definitely some point: otherwise, why 
would tbey exist? They're cool. They 
also, of course, make the tenants feel 
more comfortable than if there 

A couple of years ago, there was 
the oss-grabbing terrorist who stalked 
the mall looking for innocent young 
women to abuse. Maybe he grabbed 
some other part of their vital anatomy, 
I don'l remember for sure, but he was 
the rage of all of the retail employee 
society circles. "At any given 
moment — grab! — you were a victim. 
I don'l think mall security played a 
very big part in bis apprehension but 
it was interesting. All of the tenants 
bad this sketch artist rendering of 
him, and security was on the look- 
Thinking about it, there were a lot 
of friends of mine who ripped off 
Glenbrook, and none of them ever 
got caught. It doesn't take much 
intelligence to steal, especially if 
your friends work where you're 
stealing. Tbe point is, however, that 
Glenbrook security is on the job. 
Whether that means you can steal 
without a worry in the world or you 
con shop safely knowing they're will- 
ing to take that bullet for you, they're 
on the job and they're watching 
everything. 

Mall guards, trained like SWAT 
teams, arc there for vou. Why do these 
guys even carry guns? Arc they going 
to mow you down if you slip up? 
Hard to say, but 1 don't want to be the 
one Io pot their vigilance to the lest. ♦

Music Reviews &amp;*&amp;**&amp;&amp; 

LaBelle sparkles on new album 



to 



Palti LaBellc's "Gems" album it 
enaclly that— a gem. Wilh ihe recruit- 
menl of producers mcb at Jimmy Jam. 
Terry Lewis and Teddy Riley. LaBelle 
exposes her listeners Io a more popular 
R 4 B sound while maintaining her 
unique and energetic ilyle. 

This album's major theme is the 
pursuit of people reaching within them- 
selves to maintain honesty in their per- 
sonal relationships but also with seir. 
This is demonstrated in the upbeal bal- 
lad, "I Can't Tell My Heart What To 
Do." 

LaBellc's tender remake of "All 
This Love" is quite different from the 
pleading original by DeBarge. She pre- 
sents the song in a simple, straight for- 
ward manner with just enough spirit to 
moke it a future all-time favorite. 

"The Right Kinda Lover" demon- 
strates the complete range of LaBellc's 



voice u she describes the qualifications 
for the '"perfect man." It also serves as » 
song of praise for ber husband. L, 
Arms lead Edwards. 

Criticized for screaming — people 
who understand her music interpret it 
as soul — LaBelle uses her high pitched 
powerful chords as a personal alarm 
clock as she awakens the listener to 
find themselves, '" ..open up you eyes 
so you can sec yourself " on the soul- 
searching song, "Come As You Are " 

The other songs on the album con- 
tinue to help strengthen the message of 
self-love, sclf-acluali/ation, and love of 



While tome people love Patti 
LaBelle and other others don'l, ihi ■ 
album will definitely give fans, critics, 
and finl listeners a lasting impression 
of ihe cr&gt;&gt;ul clear vocal talent of the 
lady 1 consider the ultimate "diva." *
