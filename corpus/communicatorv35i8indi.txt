Reading 
Corps to 
promote 
literacy 

Campus group 
hoping to help 
area students 



By Amte Sarka 
The Communicator 

Forty percent ofAmcrican 
third graders cannot read by 
themselves. By the fourth 
grade, students who cannot 
read well are more likely to 
drop out of school. 

A way students can help 
is by joining the Indiana 
Reading Corps by volunteering 
about three hours a week. 

This program is a joint 
project between Indiana 
Campus Compact and the 
Indiana Department of 
Education, and last year the 
group worked with over 2,000 
second graders. The group will 
provide training to become a 
reading tutor. 

The students will be 
trained and sent out to Fort 
Wayne Community Schools. 
The program recruits as many 
people ;is they can, 

'"There is a great number 
of students who need help. We'll 
take every student who has fed- 
eral work study (for a pay-posi- 
tion) and volunteer who wants to 
make a difference in a childs 
education," Kyaw Soe said. Soe 
is the program coordinator. 

This program is a way to 
promote literacy, gain experi- 
ence, strengthen a resume and 
make a difference in the com- 
munity. Along with that, each 



least $7 loW. 5Ii. in lnuii 



the work study is 45 minutes, at 
least twice a week. This is with 
two students about three hours 
a week and may need to spend 
up to two additional hours to 
plan the session.

toothpaste costs only 51 cents in 
Bangladesh, according to 
Kemaghan). For all of the time 
and exhausting work she puts in, 
she has lo use her finger and 
ashes from the fire to brush her 
teeth. She said there is no fun in 

"My life is just Co work." 

Kemaghan went on to say 
that for many of these 
Bangladesh sweatshop workers, 
even a single egg is too expen- 
sive to eat for a meal: they have 
incut the egg in half. 

Maksuda's story is even 
more disturbing than Aklher's. 
Maksuda started working in the 
garment factories when she was 
only 11 years old. After working 
for Lucid for a year and three 
months, she became pregnant. 

"When I was in my sev- 
enth month," she said in her tes- 
timony, "one day 1 became sick 
and my head hurt. I felt weak 
and nauseous. I couldn't keep up

She went on to say, "I was 
silting at the side of my machine. 
The supervisor was standing 
over me. Then he violently 
kicked me, hard, in the stomach 
and 1 fell to the floor. My co- 
workers picked me up. I was 
crying. My co-workers went to 
the production manager and told 
him what had happened, and he 
lei me go home that afternoon, 
but I had to come back in the 
morning." Her daughter is now 
almost 2 years old. and the child 
still has a bruise on her head 
from this incident. 

"If you touch it, she cries," 
said Maksuda. "The doctor says 
that eventually it will heal."

each showing has been an hour- 
long discussion in which all 
political viewpoints have been 
expressed. Thus, the depart- 
ment is not promoting a politi- 
cal agenda or a lack of counter 
opinion. Rather than being 
aimed at swaying political 
opinion, showings of the film 
are intended to raise the level of 
discourse on this campus 
regarding a variety of social 
ami political issues. 

Although the film is 
admittedly anti-Bush, it exam- 
ines a number of compelling 
issues for people of any politi- 
cal persuasion to consider, such 



as the war in Iraq, the terrorist 
attacks of 9/11, and the role of 
government in the lives of citi- 
zens. Four showings of the film 
have been arranged not to drive 
home a political viewpoint but 
to accommodate the schedules 
of students and others who 
wanted to see the film.

not all freshmen are idiots. In

Brilliance of Baroque shines through 



"Brilliance of Baroque" 



It opened wilh Bach's 

"Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 
in G Major." 

Bach wrote this piece for 
1 1 instruments - an ensemble 
of soloists - since he had a 

The Philharmonic musi- 
cians propelled the piece with 
energetic melodies racing 
through the sections in a relay. 
Beautiful dynamic cohesion 
added the finishing touch. 

Next was Bach's "Suite 
No. 1 in C Major." Done with a 



full orchestra, it incorporated 
many movements, including the 
only Forlane and Passepied 



i rippled through endless 
jstinalo, hardly 
taking a breath. 

At times, the different 
melodies mixed like salt and 
sugar- different yet indistin- 
guishably so. 

A concerto by Vivaldi 
then followed. According to the 
conductor of the Philhamioic. 
Edvard Tchivzhel, Vivaldi, the 
"Red Monk," spent almost all 
of his life teaching at a school 
lor orphaned girls. 

These girls formed 
Vivaldi's orchestra and every 



The "Concerto for Two 
Trumpets in C Major" was one 
of Vivaldi's rare brass pieces. 

Performed by Alan Severs 
and Daniel Ross, this piece dis- 
played the classic Vivaldi ele- 

ing the other in cannon form. 

Then came the most 
unique piece of the program: 
the "Kindersymphonic in C 



M.„o 



"Toy 



Symphony," by Leopold 
Mozart, father of the more 

l.imous Wolfgang. 

In addition to the orches- 
tra, six guest soloists (Mary 
Campbell and friends) per- 
formed on the triangle, whistle, 



nightingale whistle, toy trumpet 
and drum. 

Although the toy trumpet 



able as the conductor cued the 
placement of the sounds and the 

nrvhesirj did backup. 

The piece ended in a 
delightful cacophony of the 
"toys" and orchestra and the 
audience gave much applause. 

The final piece was 
Handel's "Music for the Royal 
Fireworks." The music moved 
from energetic harmony to 
pacific passages to a lively end- 
ing. 

Solid applause met the 
finish of the piece and 
Tchivzhel received two bows.

IPFW women's 
coach Brace Patterson 
believes basketball fans 
will be thrilled by watch- 
ing his squad this year. 

"If they come out 
here and watch this team, 
they're going to fall in 
love with them. Most 
people are going to love 
the excitement, enthusi- 
asm and activity level. 
It's just a fun basketball 
game to watch," he said. 

Both IPFW squads 
are playing with a lot of 
teamwork this year. 

"So far, this is one of 
the closest teams that I 
have been associated 
with as far as comradery 
and chemistry here at 
IPFW." Noll said. 

Noll is enthusiastic 
about how his team gels 
so well, and that big 
things can be expected of 
them this season. 

"I think if we stay 
healthy and the guys play 
together, by the end of 
the year, we will be fine 
and will be satisfied with 
the results," he said. 

The men kick off the 
season at home with an 
exhibition against 
Hunington College. The 
game will start Monday, 
Nov. 1 at 7 p.m.
