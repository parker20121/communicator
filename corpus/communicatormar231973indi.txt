Today's film 

JANE FONDA WINS OSCAR FOR 'KLUTE' 



Jane Fonda, a young lady 
with outspoken political o- 
pinlons on subjects from 
Women's Liberation to am- 
nesty for those who evaded 
the draft, gives the most 
gripping performance of 
her career as a terror- 
ridden New York call girl 
hunted by a psychopathic 
killer in "Klute," today's 
film series entry. 

Her unforgettable charac- 
terization — for which she 
won the 1971 Academy A- 
ward for Best Actress — 
dominates the screen, cvn- 



ical yet senstive, and tri- 
umphantly confirms the 
p r o m i s e of her perform- 
ance in "They Shoot Hors- 
es, Don't They?" 

Starring with her is Don- 
ald Sutherland as Klute, a 
small-towm detective who 
leads the hunt for the man- 
iacal killer. His low-key 
performance combines 
dignity and restraint, per- 
fectly balancing Miss Fon- 
da's desperate intensity. 

Here is a vivid luok at 
h i g h-priced prostitution, 
the depraved fringes of the 
New York underworld and a 



tortured romance between 
the two stars, all height- 
ening the mounting sus- 
pense as the mysterious 
killer closes in on his ter- 
rified victim. 

Show-times for "Klute" 
are 12:30, 3:00, 5:30 and 
8:10 in Room 246 and 10:30 
in the Auditorium of Build- 
ing A. Admission is free to 
activity card holders and 
$1 for all others. The Film 
Series Committee cautions 
that there is only limited 
seating capacity. . ,c om e

Dear Editor: 



I would like to comment on 
the article by Stan Jones In 
the March 16th Issue of the 
Communicator. The subject 
of his article was the lec- 
ture given by Gloria Stein- 
em and Margaret Sloan. 

Mr. Jones seems to have 
a small problem with his 
choice of pronouns. I sug- 
gest he not Include himself 
with the feminists on our 
campus. To say that all of 
"us" left the student lounge 
feeling "let down" is de- 
finitely a mistake. Of 
course, Mr. Jones was 
speaking for himself only. 

My first objection to the 
article is that the author 
does not deal with any of the 
issues involved with the fe- 



minist movement. If Mr. 
Jones wishes to deal with 
the issues, why then does- 
n't he deal with them in- 
stead of making a few bia- 
sed statements? Although 
he doesn't really take a 
stand, one gets the feeling 
that Mr. Jones objects to 
the issue of day-care. Per- 
haps he feels that day-care 
centers will break down his 
ideal of a family; that child- 
ren of "working mothers" 
will grow up to be delin- 
quent. However, none of the 
literature supports thiste- 
nent. In fact, recent re- 
search done by Bronfen- 
brenner reveals thatthe 
most optimal situation for 
the child is that in which 
the mother does work out- 
side the home. (Those re- 



sults should shake some of 
our most worshipped social 
norms.) 

My ma 1 n objection to the 
article is that every sen- 
tence is clearly written by 
a sexist. To say that Ms. 
Steinem and Ms. Sloan had 
no surprises implies that 
Mr. Jones is already fam- 
iliar with the issues of the 
women's movement. How- 
ever, his article proves 
that he not only isn't know- 
ledgeable on the subject, 
but also is prejudiced a- 
gainst any new facts pre- 
sented to him by the ex- 
perts—in this case, the 
women themselves. 

The facts are that in 1970, 
38% of the total vvorking 
force were women, yet to- 
day a female college grad- 



uate still earns less than a 
man with a n eighth grade 
education. Women learn 
that "to get a good job, 
get a good education" ap- 
plies only to their white 
male co-eds. 
If Mr. Jones still wants 
to pretend that sex dis- 
crimination does not exist, 
and he doesn't want to lis- 
ten to half the population — 
then why doesn't he take 
the time to do his own re- 
search? Then maybe next 
time he will be able to write 
an article worth attention. 
As for this one, I say he 
doesn't even get to first 
base. 

Sincerely, 

Ms. Kathy Eberhardt

Baha 'i Club 
formed here 



A new college club is bud- 
ding this spring — a Baha'l 
Club (pronounced Ba-hl- 
ee). And at the root of the 
club are the following prin- 
ciples which are to bind 
people together In a united 
world: Men and women must 
seek for truth In spite of 
custom, prejudice, and tra- 
dition; Men and women must 
have equal opportunities, 
rights, and privileges; The 

Skelton^new 
director of 
admissions 

Fort Wayne, Indiana — Dr. 
David R. Skelton, 4257 
Goegleln Rd., has been 
named director of the 
Division of Admissions and 
Records on the Indiana - 
Purdue Campus, effective 
May 16, 1973. 

In making the announce- 
ment, Dr. John P. Ulmer, 
associate dean for student 
services, noted that Skelton 
will direct impllmintation 
of a single admissions- 
records system for the two 
universities. 

He succeeds Neil Lantz 
who recently accepted a 
similar position for Ind- 
iana - Purdue at Ind- 
ianapolis. 

In September, 1969, he 
became assistant pro- 
fessor and assistant 
director of the Education 
Division for Indiana Uni- 
versity here. 



nations must choose an in- 
ternational language to be 
used along with the mother 
tongue; All children must 
receive a basic education; 
Men and women must make 
a systematic effort to wipe 
out all those prejudices 
which divide people; Peo- 
ple must recognize that re- 
ligion should go hand-in- 
hand with science; People 
must work to abolish wealth 
and extreme poverty. 

The fresh spirit of theclib 
can best be gleaned from 
the following quote sfrom 
the writings of Baha'u'Uah, 
Prophet-Founder of the 
Baha*i Faith: "Theearthls 
one country and mankind its 
citizens. "..."All men have 
been created to carry for- 
ward an ever advancing ci- 
vilization.. To act like the 
beasts of the field is un- 
worthy of man. Those vir- 
tues that befit his dignity 
are forebearance, mercy, 
compassion and loving- 
kindness towards all the 
peoples and kindreds of the 
earth.". .."That one indeed 
is a man who, to-day, ded- 
icateth himself to the ser- 
vice of the entire human 
race. "..."True loss is for 
him whose days have been 
spent in utter ignorance of 
his true self."..."Th e 
world is but a show, vain 
and empty, a mere nothing, 
bearing the semblance of 
reality. Set not your affec- 
tions upon it." 

Everyone is welcome at 
the rap sessions held in 
Room G-47, Thursdays 
from 11:30-1:00. 



The University Singers 
are preparing for a really 
exciting concert on the 
evening of May 1. The 
featured composition for 
the concert will be the Te 
Deum by Anton Bruckner. 
This work will be perform- 
ed by the University Sing- 
ers and the University 
Orchestra. 

The Te Deum as a musi- 
cal form has been used for 
more than a thousand years 
to commemorate such fes- 
tive events as the coming 
of peace, significant vic- 
tories, or other festive oc- 
casions of thanksgiving. 

Since they have begun re- 
hearsal on the Bruckner, 
they have realized that per- 
haps there are many more 
students or faculty who 
might like to join with them 
to present this work. Ac- 



cordingly, they have set 
aside Tuesday and Thurs- 
day rehearsals to devote 
them entirely to the Bruck- 
ner Te Deum. Any student 
or faculty member who 
desires to sing is invited 
to attend these rehearsals 
and perform this work with 
them. 

There are many reasons 
that students who were ac- 
tive In music can no longer 
participate In one of the 
University musical groups. 
It is hoped that the limit- 
ed rehearsal times and the 
specific concert date will 
enable many students to 
rehearse with the Univer- 
sity Singers at 2:30-3:20 
in the Recital Hall on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
It is going to be a signifi- 
cant experience; it Is hoped 
that everyone will join in.
