IPFW fine arts professor wins 
best of show for painting 



By Jo Ann Steinforth 
Features Editor 

John Hrchov, assistant professor 
of fine arts at IPFW won a besl-of- 
show award for his oil painting. 
"Chrisiabel" in the 1993 American 
Stales Arts Competition in Indi- 
anapolis on July 15 where he re- 
ceived a $2,000 prize. 



Susanne Ghez, Jurist for the Re- 
naissance Society al the University 
of Chicago, selected his painting 
from a field of 460 entries. 

"I was inspired to name this 
painting after reading a 19lh centu- 
ry poem called "Christabel" by 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge," said 
Hrehov. "And I worked on it for 
about two years." 



Hrehov said that his idea came 
from his personal images. He was 
fascinated by the 19th century po- 
em entitled, "Chrisiabel." 

In addition, he worked with 
IPFW artists Nancy E. McCroskey 
and AnnMarie LeBlanc in March 
1992, to create "Tribute," a mixed- 
media piece that was placed in the 
lobby of the Williams Threatre. 



Hrchov paints on a regular basis 
and is continually developing and 
showing his other works. His next 
show will be in the spring at 
Union University in Jacksonville. 
Tennessee. 

The American Slates Exhibit end- 
ed August 27 and "Christabel" will 
be brought back to a private collec- 
tion in Ft. Wayne.

An Excerpt from "Christabel," 
by Samuel Taylor Coleridge 



It was a lovely sig 
The lady Christabel, when she 
Was praying at the old oak Iree. 
Amid the jagged shadows 
Of mossy leafless boughs, 
Kneeling in the moonlight, 
To make her gentle vows; 
Her slender palms together prest, 
Heaving sometimes on her breast; 
Her face resigned to bliss or bale 
Her face, oh call it fair not pale, 
And both blue yes more bright 
than clear, 
f: jch about to have a tear. 



With open eyes (ah woe is me!) 
Asleep, and dreaming fearfully, 
Fearfully dreaming, yet, I wis, 
Dreaming that alone, which is 
O sorrow and shame! Can this be 

she, 
The lady, who knelt at the old oak 

tree? 

And lo! the worker of these 

harms, 
That holds the maiden in her 

arms, 
Seems to slumber still and mild. 
As a mother with her child. 



Long explains 'no' vote 

By Kristie Schlundt docs not approve of the means by 

News editor which Clinton's supporters plan to 

achieve that reduction. 

Fourth District Representative Jill Long said, "Although I believe 

Long has been the President Clinton 

object of both ej is committed to re- 



praise and criti- 
cism in the local 
media following 
her August 5 vote 
against the budget 
bill that passed 
through the U.S. 
House of Repre- 
sentatives. 

David Early, 
press secretary to 
Congresswoman 
Long, said that the 
*no' vote was in 
response to the ap- 
proximately 1000 
phone calls that were answered in 
Long's Washington offices during 
the 3 days prior to the vote. 

Because of the volume of calls re- 
ceived by the Washington office. 
Early staled that Long's staff was 
unable to collect demographic data 
from the callers. Nevertheless, Early 
stated his belief that most of (he 
callers represented the concerns of 
the private citizenry rather than cor- 
porate concerns, and that the callers 
hailed from all parts of the con- 
si ituency. 

While Early said that Long strong- 
ly supports deficit reduction, she 




ducing the deficit 
and moving the 
United States for- 
ward, I do not be- 
lieve this budget 
I (he 



chall

Early said that 
Long probably 
would have been 
able to support a 
budget bill (hat 
slated greater 
spending cuts — 
particularly in the 
first few years — and fewer tax in- 
creases. 

The legislation considered on Au- 
gust 5 was a measure negotiated be- 
tween the House and the Senate that 
will result in $496 billion in deficit 
reduction over the next 5 years. 

The Senate proposal to increase 
the federal gas lax by 4.3 cenls a 
gallon. Long vehemently opposed 
the tax "because of the dispropor- 
tionate impact it will have on rural 
areas. ..gas tax would likely cost rur- 
al residents 20-25 percent more than 
urban residents.," according to 
Long's Washington press office.

An eyewitness came forward in 
the shooting death of IPFW student, 
Paul Rossetti, and a suspect, as a re- 
sult, is in the Allen County Jail. 

Chris A. Hillon, 18, of Fort 
Wayne, is accused of murdering 
Rossetti. Hillon intended to kill a 
man who attempted to rape his girl- 



friend, but in a tragic twisi of i 
taken identity, Rossetti was killed 
instead. 

The eyewitness reported that Ros- 
setti let Hilton into his Spring Har- 
bor apartment late in the evening on 
Aug. 20. Hilton reportedly began 
accusing Rossetti of the rape which 
he denied. Hillon ordered him into a 
bedroom and to lie down with a pil- 
low over his head. Then Rossetti 



was shot twice in the head with a 
handgun. 

Police charged Hilton with murder 
last Friday. According lo Ihe Fori 
Wayne area newspapers, Hillon has 
a lengthy criminal past that includes 
child molesting, first degree bur- 
glary, theft, trespass, minor con- 
sumption, and serving time at the 
Indiana Boys' School.

Police suggest alternate route 

University Police Chief Loren DenHartog suggested this week thai faculty and sludents need to slarl using the 
new access to the campus on Crescent Avenue. 

"They insist on using the access at Anthony and Coliseum, and thai gets traffic backed up to Pamell," 
DenHartog staled. 

"Maybe nobody knows thai Ihe new entrance is open," he continued, "but 37 is much belter equipped lo han- 
dle traffic than Coliseum."

The balance of power changed 
hands on August 24 when a majori- 
ty of the Indiana University Board 
of Trustees voted against the leader- 
ship of John D. Walda in favor of 
new board president Robert H. 
McKinney. 

Board member Ray Richardson 
said, "A different style of leadership 
was desirable. 

"Many trustees felt that the author- 
ity of the board — the power of the 
board should be shared by all mem- 
bers, and should not be exercised by 
the president only," Richardson con- 
tinued. 

Richardson explained that under 
Walda's leadership, some board 
members felt lhat they were unable 
lo discuss all of the issues lhat Ihcy 
wanted to discuss, by virtue of the 
fact that the president of Ihe board 
shapes Ihe agenda. 

"U appeared to me lhat Walda was 
uniformly reflecting Ihe opinions of 
the president of the Universily," 



Richardson 

Although Richardson said (hal 
there is nothing wrong wilh repre- 
senting Ihe position of the university 
administration, Richardson also said 
lhat Walda had "tried to impose" his 
opinions on the board rather than 
merely present his opinions. 

"In that position," Richardson 
said, "you've got lo have ears and 
be sensitive lo people. ..if anything, 
he was too strong a leader." 

Richardson added lhat he has no 
problem with Walda on a personal 
level, and that he had no desire lo 
make Walda "look bad in one of his 
hometown newspapers." 

Walda will remain an aclive board 
member. His present term as board 
member ends in 1996. 

McKinney has been a member of 
the board since 1989. His present 
term ends in 1995. 

In addition lo his position as presi- 
dent of Ihe I.U. Board of Trustees, 
McKinney is Chairman and CEO of 
both First Indiana Corporation and 
Somerset Group, Inc. He retired as 



senior partner in the law firm Bose, 
McKinney &amp; Evans in 1991. He 
serves on numerous boards in a va- 
riety of capacities: he is director of 
Ihe I.U. Foundation, chairman of the 
Government Operation Committee 
for the Bayh Administration, and 
member of the board of the Indiana 
State Chamber of Commerce. 

McKinney has been highly visible 
in the National Democratic Parly 
where he has played active roles in 
political campaigns since 1960. 

Walda was the board president of 
the I.U. trustees 1992-93. He resides 
in Fort Wayne where he is a partner 
in the law firm of Barren &amp; McNag- 
ny. Walda is also a board member of 
the I.U. Foundation. He serves on 
the boards of various Fort Wayne 
organizations, including Allen 
County Parks and Recreation, Ju- 
nior Achievement of Northeast Indi- 
ana, Fort Wayne Civic Theatre, Ihe 
Fort Wayne Museum of Art, and 
Fort Wayne Newspapers, Inc. 

Both Walda and McKinney are 
I.U. alumni. 



New campus minister anticipates 
challenging pluralistic environment 



By Ngozi R Rogers 
Staff Writer 

The beginning of any semester at 
IPFW seems lo bring changes. 

Whelher ii is new buildings, new 
courses or new faces, IPFW grows 
and changes. 

One addition to IPFW since the 
beginning of Ihe fall semester is the 
selection of a new campus minister 
represcnling ihe Greater Fort Wayne 
Campus Ministry. 

Reverend Cheryl Peterson was se- 
lected from the three part time min- 
isters that IPFW had during last 
fall's interim year. 

Reverend Peterson, who prefers to 
be called Cheryl, graduated in June 
of this year from the Belhany Theo- 
logical Seminary in Oakbrook, Illi- 
nois, with a 3 year Masters of Di- 
vinity degree and will be ordained 
in October. 

Peterson remembers herself as al- 
ways wanting to be a helper when 
she was younger. This want along 
with learning, her greatest passion, 
teaching one of her skills and her in- 
terest in local congregation helped 
the former music therapist become a 
reverend. 

As a music therapist, Peterson was 
able to be a helper but said, "I 
couldn't share my faith." 

Being in an environment where 
she was able lo share her faith was 
important. However, the mother of 
three and one half of 'a clergy cou- 
ple'- her husband is also a pastor in 




Fort Wayne- also wanted space for 
all (he things she values. 

"This position puts all Ihe pieces 
together," Reverend Cheryl Peter- 
son explains, "there's room for all 
the things lhat are important to me." 

Peterson said, "What is appealing 
about Campus Ministry is lhat il is a 
place where we arc encouraged to 
look al religion in our minds and 
live oul our faiih." 

As IPFW's campus minister, Pe- 
terson is the advisor to ihe Campus 
Ministry Student Group, is available 
for pastoral care and counseling for 
all sludents, faculty and staff and is 
ihe liaison between Ihe community, 
Ihe church and the campus. 

An important part of Peterson's 
ministry is for her to be in the ma- 
trix saying, 'yes there is a way lo in- 
legrale failh in a pluralistic setting'. 
The pluralistic environment al 
IPFW guarantees experiences wilh 
persons of different points of view. 
As we listen wilh care lo those other 
views we grow in our understanding 
of our own views. 

"Part of Ihe quest is looking at Ihe 



big questions," Peterson said. "We 
don't live in a simplistic world. It's 
a complex world where big ques- 
tions arc raised and the church 
needs to be a part of the dialogue." 

Rev, Peterson is noi the first fe- 
male minister IPFW has had. 

"Dr. Margaret McCray-Worrall 
was Ihe first," Pelerson explains. 

"To be a female minister in the 
90's is challenging," admits Peter- 
son, "but 50 percent of my graduat- 
ing class were women so it's not 
new." 

Pelerson has been in Fori Wayne 
for three years. 

As ihe new minister, she knows 
thai in Ihe firsl year it is important 
for her lo learn about the campus, 
get to know the students, faculty 
and staff and listen to be able to as- 
sess the needs on campus. 

She is up for the challenge and is 
excited about the new position. 

"1 want people to know the office 
is open and available lo everyone no 
mailer whal denomination or tradi- 
tion Ihey represent." Pelerson said, 
"programs are good but another im- 
portant piece is being available to 
people." 

Peterson, originally from "too 
many places to count' concludes, "I 
hope I stay here awhile." 

The Reverend Cheryl Peterson of 
the Protestant denomination Church 
of the Breihren has office hours 
Monday through Wednesday from 8 
until 4 in the Helmke Library room 
362 or call 481-6994.

Civil rights 

How far have we come? 



"There are those who ask the 
devotees of civil rights, 'When 
will you be satisfied?'..." 

This question was first posed by 
Martin Luther King in 1963 when 
he gave his famous "I have a 
dream" speech in 
Washington, D.C. 
This past weekend 
was the anniversary 
of Ihe delivery of 
thai speech. 

The celebration of 
this monumental 
event should force 
all Americans to 
ask themselves: 
how far have 
African- Americans 
come since the civil rij 
meal began? 

The answer is clear: not that far. 

In the workplace, civil rights 
lives 3 paltry existence. The 
"Good-ole'-boys' Club" still 
maintains a frighleningly firm 
grip on the corporate world. This 
is a world where African -Ameri- 
cans are discriminated against, a 
world where, for some, achieve- 
ment and success are possible on- 
ly to the point where the upward 
movement of the African- Ameri- 
can is suddenly halted when he or 
she cracks his head against an all- 
too-real glass ceiling. 

People still perceive Affirmative 
Action as reverse discrimination 
instead of a vehicle lo allow 
African-Americans access lo the 
best job opportunities. 

In the court rooms, it seems that 
justice is the sole property of the 
Good-ole'-boys. African- Ameri- 
cans still feel the unbearable pres- 
sure of racism which exploded in- 
to (he recent L.A. Riots caused by 
the beating of Rodney King and 
the reaction to the acquittal of the 
LA. Four. However, society tried 
to correct itself by charging the 
four "defenders of truth, justice, 
and the American way" with fed- 
eral charges of violating King's 
civil rights; however, the charges 
resulted in a single acquittal and a 
handful of light federal prison 
sentences. 

Consider also the Kennedy- 
Smith rape trial in which a white 
man was found not-guilty of the 
alleged rape of a woman who was 
probably under the influence of 
alcohol at the time of the alleged 
incident (ergo, she "wanted it"). 

Then compare the Kennedy- 
Smith (rial to the similar case 
concerning world boxing heavy- 
weight champion Mike Tyson 
who was convicted of raping a 
young black beauty queen. Like 
the accuser in the Kennedy-Smith 
case, we had a scenario where a 
woman was, against good judg- 
ment, out on the town with a man 
alone, then accompanies the man 
lo his living accommodations, 
against all common sense. One 
man was acquitted, and the other 
was jailed. 




Why? 

Mike Tyson is black, while 
Kennedy-Smith is lity-while. 

Finally, it would seem that the 
greatest bastion of "Good-ole'- 
boys Club" is still politics, as in- 
dicated by the 
greatest recent ex- 
ploitation of 
African-Ameri- 
cans: the Clarence 
Thomas/Anita Hill 
hearings. The con- 
troversy that ex- 
posed the possibili- 
ty that Supreme 
Court nominee 
Thomas (now 
Supreme Court As- 
sociate Justice), had sexually ha- 
rassed a former employee. Femi- 
nist organizations automatically 
jumped to Anita Hill's defense 
claiming that (he issue at hand 
was sexual harassment and not 
race discrimination. In an oven 
sense, sexual harassment was an 
issue. But, more subtly, it was in 
fact, an issue of color. Because 
Hill and Thomas arc black, the 
Senate had no regard for their 
reputations; instead the Senate 
drug them through the dirt so vi- 
ciously that one can only con- 
clude that it was done with a 
twisted sense of glee. 

Question: Why was there no 
media coverage on the fact that 
African -Americans were the ones 
who rescued the injured truck dri- 
ver Reginald Denny and trans- 
ported him to a hospital for med- 
ical care? 

Question: Would there have 
been so much media coverage if 
Thomas was accused of sexually 
harassing a white woman? 

Question: If it were a white 
woman accusing him of sexual 
harassment, would his nomination 
have been confirmed? 

Question: Why are there only a 
handful of black professors on 
IPFW's campus? 

Question: Why arc there only 3 
college courses on this campus 
that center on African -Americans 
and their culture? 

Question: Why are radical 
African-Americans, such as the 
Black Panthers, currently organiz- 
ing for a military conflict against 
the government that is controlled 
by non-black Americans? 

Question: When are we going lo 
realize that until African- Ameri- 
cans are treated with the respect 
they deserve as members of this 
existing planet, society will con- 
tinue to follow along in its current 
path of self-destruction? 

Martin Luther King, Jr. said it 
best, "It would be fatal for the na- 
tion to overlook Ihe urgency of 
the moment. This sweltering sum- 
mer of Ihe Negro's legitimate dis- 
content will not pass until there is 
an invigorating autumn of free- 
dom and equality." 
And that was 30 years ago. 



Comment of the week: 

"People should be treated equal not because it is 

right, but because people arc equal." 

A comment overheard in the halls of Walb made by a 

student.

Aunt Louise advises singles on romance 




Dear Aunt Louise, 

I'm so in love, but he doesn't 
know 1 exist! 

I've tried everything short of slip- 
ping and falling down right in front 
of him. 

1 know you're going to tell me to 
lake the first step and call him, but 
I'm really an old-fashioned gal. So. 
that's not an option! 

Any suggestions? Inside, I'm just 



Yours, 
Dowd and Out 

Dear Down and Out, 

My cousin Melvis is going 
through the same ordeal. I always 
encourage her lo keep on searching 
until she finds some feller who 
wants to settle down. 

Now, of course I'm gonna tell you 
to go and make the first move. 
Some of theses here fellers don't 
know what their missin'! Now, 
durin' my time, a woman would 
never ask a man out, but this is not 
my time, and I have my Dorcus. 
So, what you need to do is ask this 
special someone to supper and try to 
sweep him off his feet by fixin' him 
a home cooked meal! Contrary to 
what some people say, a way to a 
man's heart is still through his stom- 
ach. Just ask my Dorcus. 

I hope you can cook. If not just 
ask your mamma for some help-or 
better yet, your grandma. Better yet, 
pick up a Betty Crocker cookbook, 
the single girl's bible, and an apron 



from Victoria's Secret, if you know 
what I mean. 

Now, if he doesn't see Ihe light by 
then, just drop him like a mare 
shaking a fly off her butt. Then you 
pick yourself up, and find yourself a 
nice church. That's where you'll 
find yourself a nice feller with 
morals and values, and a healthy ap- 
preciation for an old-fashioned gal. 
Your loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

My girlfriend is on my case be- 
cause I don't look like Topaz Man! 

I hate pumping iron! And yeah 
I'm a little flabby, but I think my 
girlfriend should accept me just the 
way I am. 

She says I need to lake more pride 
in myself. 

We've agreed lo abide by your de- 
cision — so what is it? 

Yours, 
Love Handles 

Dear Love Handles, 

I cannot believe the nerve of your 
girlfriend. My husband Dorcus was 



skinny loo when we first met. Not 
once did 1 ever suggest to him to 
lose weighl even though my pork- 
chop is sneaking up on lhal 300- 
pound mark. He's a sweel, gentle 
man who cats until his heart is con- 
tent. What is wrong with that? 
Does weighl gain make him a dif- 
ferent man? Of course nol. 

You need to lei your girlfriend 
know lhal you are proud of your 
size and figure. Ask her if she is in 
love with your image or heart! 

If it's your heart, then she will un- 
derstand and continue to love you. 

If it is your image, I would break 
up wilh her. Because you're loo 
kind of a person to be in cohorts 
wilh an earthy type woman like her. 
You need lo find yourself a nice 
woman who likes you for yourself 
not your pant size! 

Your loving Aunt Louise 

P.S. Ask her if sbe needs lo go on a 

diet! 

P.P.S. Please drop off any problems 

lo the Communicator, Room 215, 

Walb Memorial.

COMMENTARY 

Student reminisces about values of the sixties 



Once upon a lime, for o thousand 
days, Jack and Jacqueline Kennedy 
lived in the White House and presided 
over their domain with a magical blend 
of elegance and vibrance. Never bad a 
first lady been so good-looking or 
seemed so young, so intelligent, so tal- 
ented, so brimming wilh vitality. Nor 
had affairs of stale, boih social and po- 
litical, been conducted wilh such style. 

The lone was set on the very first day. 
when Kennedy invited Robert Frosl to 
his inaugural, and it carried through lo a 
day very close lo the end, when the 
young President told an audience at 
Amherst College he looked forward to 
"an America which will nol be afraid of 
love and beauty." Ii was before, howev- 



er, on that first day that the young Presi- 
dent's words reverberated in the ears of 
this nation's youth and signaled a new 
hope for the future: 

Let the world go forth from this 
lime and place. ..that the torch has 
been passed to a new generation of 
Americans. ..So let us begin a 
new.. .This endeavor will light our 
country.. .and the glow from Ihe fire 
can truly light the world. 
In a few precious years the light from 
lhal lorcb was extinguished by an assas- 
sin's bullet and replaced wilh a Presi- 
dent who, in 1967 and speaking of war 
the war in Vietnam, pronounced a "light 
at the end of Ihe tunnel" just a few short 
weeks before the Tel Offensive which in 



its violence shattered the myth of an ex- 
hausted enemy. The only glow now 
lighting Ihe world came from those 
burning Vietnamese villages being casu- 
ally set on fire by U.S. Marines wilh 
cigarcllc lighters ("Zippo Squads"), and 
the passing torch became an incendiary 
weapon of results of which were real- 
ized in the napalm -scarred bodies of 
screaming children. 

It was of this time and scenario lhal 
ihe Hippie movement came to the fore- 



due Theatre will attempt to capture in 
presentation of the rock-musical, HAIR. 
A presentotion that one hopes will not 
be simply a celebration of peace and 
love, sex and rock &amp; roll. The presenta- 



tion of HAIR should be a theatrical mir- 
ror lhal reflects darkly as well as bright- 
ly, and yet one hopes, a mirror that docs 
not distort the passion for humanism, in-

Room ^7 

by Managing Editor, 
F. Lane Douse 

So, I'm silting in my Algebra 
class when (his guy walks into our 
six o'clock class seven minutes 
tale. [ guess he can't tell lime, eh? 
The prof is just rambling on and on 
and on about doing this review. 

Of course I haven't done any 
problems yet. Heaven forbid, I'm 
behind! PRESS ON! 

He's writing a problem on (he 
board, but mosl of my attention is 
in the hall. By the way, what's mi- 
nus one Io the fifth power? 

Sure, the prof is a really cool guy. 
He's just teaching a — Excuse me 
note break-a+z=b - do you under- 
stand that? Anyway, as 1 was say- 
ing — a boring subject. 

We have another latecomer. This 
one is twenty minutes lale. 

Look at this- a third latecomer! 
Now, if you walk into a one hour 
and fifteen minule course thirty 
minutes lale, 1 ask you: why come? 
Of course, I have to admit there are 
some classes I have shown up with 
only len minules left. But lhat's Io 
show (he professors that 1 like them 
enough to even show up when 
class is almosl over. Of course, 
some would prefer if I just showed 

p on time. 

Can you change a radical in Ihe 
denominator? 

Conjugates, radicals, fractions! 
Hell, I should have stayed in Ihe 
Education department. 

You know, once you cock your 
head back and close your eyes, you 
know you are in deep, deep, deep 
(rouble. Mine eyes have seen Ihe 
coming and glory of going to 




sleep. ..my eyes are closing now. 

You know what's funny? When a 
professor leans against a chalk- 
board and turns around with chalk 
on Ihe back of his or her shirl. 
Thai is so funny, I tell you. And of 
course you never tell them. You 
just let them wander around look' 
tng goofy. 

Now, we're reading the RE- 
MARK of the book. My question, 
when have books been known lo 
make remarks? 

Twenly-fivc minules to go., just 
call me polynomial. 

There is this Butterfinger candy 
bar laying under this student's 
desk. I'm thinking I can just 
squeeze pas! the iwo unoccupied 
desks in front of me, bend down, 
and snatch the candy bar. 

Then, he turns around like Bar! 
Simpson and yells, "Don't lay a 
finger on my Butterfinger!" Cold 
busted by a Bart Simpson wanna- 
be. 

Fifteen minules nil I'm "free ai 
last, free at last..." you know Ihe 
rest! 

Why is il thai if you yawn one 
time in class, the professor looks al 
you like you are crazy or some- 
thing? 

Seven minules until Ihis class is 
over and there are already people 
in Ihe hallway walking from class 
to class or talking. I'm -nil in class 
just watching. Lucky me, eh? 

Ya know, it's kind of funny when 
people who walk by look in Ihe 
door at you. They just smile, even 
though some of them know you arc 
in torture. 

The answer is one damn-it! 



Letter to the editor 
Get involved on campus 



To Ihe Editor 

Last Monday, IPFW witnessed 
something phenomenal, never seen 
before. It was Gregory Bracho play- 
ing Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3: 
Air. Not! Actually it was the new 
herd of incoming students to IPFW 
that made headlines. 

First, I want to congratulate all of 
you who have chosen to attend 
IPFW. II is a good college thai has 
good professors, various services 
that I do not even know about and 
very friendly and understanding po- 
lice officers. The best place to hang 
out- Walb Union! I am serious, it is 
the only place where you can attend 
THE FORT lo eat, play cards, gos- 
sip and plan new ways to overthrow 
the administration. You can also do 
the MTV THING. It goes something 
like Ihis. You enter Walb from the 
| main entrance, make a U-turn to 
your first left intersection and park 
yourself right in front of the TV 
(Believe me this is the only place 
where you can find an affordable 

■ parking spot). Plog in to MTV. Turn 

■ the volume all the way up until you 
see the Chancellor coming up to you 
...BEGGING YOU. ..to turn up the 



volume one more notch. If you want 
to be politically active, you can at- 
tend any of the Indiana Purdue Stu- 
dent Government Association (IPS- 
GA) meetings for FREE! But first, 
off to the Sweet Shop and ask Geor- 
gia (Just a young, sweet lady) to 
give you some ammunition to blast 
those senators to Jamaica. 

Now. if you do not like Walb, 
which is (he worst crime an IPFW 
student could commit, then you can 
be exempt from freshman initiation 
BY ATTENDING THE FINE 
ARTS BUILDING! 

Now, if you want to get a little, 
say, ROMANTIC, then the Gazebo 
is just for you and your beloved. 
Birds will come singing to you, 
squirrels will bring you nuts and the 
skunks will bring you their best gift. 

As for now, if you want to have 3 
little more guidance on the MTV 
thing, or romantic, or overthrowing 
lPFW's administration, or a new 
boyfriend? AAAHHM, you can find 
me in Walb 5:00 to 9:00, Tuesdays 
and Thursdays at the Student Recre- 
ational Center. 

Musically &amp; Brotherly Yours, 
Gregory John Bracbo

Hippie 



from page two 



during 1967, the heart of which came io 
be known as the Summer of Love. On 
Easter, 10.000 attended New York's 
Central Pan "Be-In." In June, the Beat- 
les released Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts 
Club Band. In July, Jimi Hcndrix literal- 
ly lit up the stage at the Monterey Pop 
Festival, In August, cast met west when 
the Beatles visited Indian holy man Ma- 
harisbi Mahesh Yogi and promptly re- 
nounced drugs. And throughout Ihe 
summer a gaudy army of innocents, 
charlatans, runaways, activists, weasels, 
entrepreneurs, frcc-tovers and would-be 
free-lovers descended upon newly or- 
dained mecca of hippicdom: San Fran- 
cisco's Haight-Ashbury district. 

Everything wasn't peace and love, to 
be sure. Riots killed 40 people in Detroit 
and left 5,000 homeless in July. H. Rap 
Brown was calling for violence on the 
grounds that "violence is as American as 
cherry pic." And the Vietnam War raged 
unabated with the nightly-news showing 
an ever- increasing number of body-bags 
containing dead American men and 
women. Taken together, the events of 
these years helped shape the identity of 



a generation. The 60's were not a time 
or even a place. They wee a set of val- 
ues, the legacy of which, ripples of whal 
happened, in those years, are slill being 
felt all around us. 

I think the 60's had to do with some 
inner beat. Every now and then Ihis beat 
causes us to break bounds of repression 
imposed by our puritanical and material- 
istic society. It is a beat that every so of- 
ten gets stronger, and then it slacks off. 
In the 60's the beat became strong again. 

Could it happen again? I'm sure it 
will. History moves in spirals, not cir- 
cles. But, why would you want it to hap- 
pen again? It's like that first lime you 
make love, you'll never forget it, but 
you don't want to keep repeating Ihe 
same experience. The point is that a 
whole generation still holds on lo those 
values. We haven't grown up, despite 
Ihe best efforts of our ciders and our so- 
ciety. We're struck at thai lime in our 
lives when things really mattered, and I, 
for one, am proud to still be there.

Three' 

Alumni artists kick off season 



By Jo Ann Steinforth 
Features Editor 

The art exhibit "Three" kicked off 
the fall season of art with a recep- 
tion and a mini video fest in the lob- 
by of the Fine Arts Building that be- 
gan on Friday, August 27 from 8-9 
p.m. "Three" will run through Sep- 
tember 22- 

John M. Morris, assislant 10 the 
Dean of the School of Fine and Per- 
forming Arts, said, " "Three" is the 
first of a series of exhibits that will 
be held throughout the year and 
will feature alumni, students and 
faculty." 

Alumni Sue Sells, Judith Ann 
Lehman and Sue Tucker's artwork 
is currently on exhibit in the lobby 
of the IPFW Fine Arts Building. 

After the reception, visitors were 
offered a mini video fest in the 
Plogslerth Lecture Hall, spotlighting 
"Fort Wayne Artists on Art" by pho- 
tographer Sells. Sells interviewed 
local artists Betty Fishman, Aniko 
Droegmeyer, Karen Thompson and 
Steve Purdy. 

As seen in the video, Purdy be- 
came so interested in religious 



works of art glass that he went to 
Wales to study the medium. He calls 
himself "a stained glass painter." 
His creative process begins with 
pencil sketches, then fills them in 
later with water colors. After ap- 
proval, the next step is to be sent to 
the studio. 

Finally, the studio cuts his glass to 
his specifications and returns the 
cut pieces to him packed in an ice 
cooler. 

Purdy explained the love of his 
chosen art form. "1 had worked this 
way every day for the last 23 
years. I learned my craft from my 
father, who was an art director in 
Hollywood." 

"I had no idea stained glass would 
take off and that I could make a liv- 
ing out of it," said Purdy. 

One of the highlights of the 
evening was the award winning 
rock music video, "The Clean-Up 
Man," a light hearted spoof of the 
homeless and performed by the lo- 
cal band Pop *n' Fresh. 

Ted Brown produced this award- 
winning musical and also wrote the 
song, "The Clean-Up Man, along 
with band members Travis Brown 



and Jeremy Sells. The video was 
produced about 1 1/2 years ago. 

"It was fun to work on," said 
Brown. "We filmed this downtown 
at the Shrine Mizpah Temple." 

"Strut" also was shown during the 
video fest. This was a Michael Qua- 
tro music video produced by the 
Production Studio. 

Sue Tucker earned her B.FA at 
IPFW and her work is heavily influ- 
enced by Pre-Columbian, Greek and 
Egyptian art. Her Bat Shrine piece 
was a unusual piece of work. 

Lehman exhibited one of her cre- 
ations, "Judith Stones," which are 
ceramic and acrylic kernels that 
have a Native American back- 
ground. She earned her B.A. in psy- 
chology from IPFW. 

"The department's eventual goal is 
to have a gallery constructed to the 
Fine Arts Building, but it's only in 
the planning stage," said Morris. It 
would be a more appropriate space 
than placing the exhibits in the lob- 
by, as. they are done now." 

Exhibition hours are 8 a.m. to 6 
p.m. Monday through Saturday and 
noon to 6 p.m. on Sundays.

The Age of Aquarius returns to 
Fort Wayne as the rock musical 
"Hair" celebrates its 25th birthday 
this year. Auditions were held Sun- 
day, August 29 in Room 113 at 
William's Theatre. 

Twenty-nine hopefuls tried out for 
the 90s version of Larry Life's pro- 
duction. This era's musical cast 
members may not be sporting the 
long afros and love beads of the 
60s, but the occasional tie dyed T- 
shirt could be seen on the singers 
and actors lining the hallways. 

During a brief cigarette break. Life 
gave his opinion of the audition 
results. 

" 'Hair' is primarily a musical and 
we looked at the personalities of the 
actors as well as their voices. Each 
character grows from the person 
playing their part," said Life. 

The director is looking to fill be- 
tween 20-25 slots in the cast and the 
criteria is based on vocal ability. 

"The musical is a true ensemble 
piece, everyone is featured at one 
time or another. It will be a love 
tribute," added Life. 

"I am pleased with the way the au- 
ditions went, we were able to cap- 
ture an almost completely diverse 
group, with the exception of the 
lack of African American males," 
said Life. "We have a specific song 
for this segment, so I may have to 
make a few phone calls," he added. 

Life described "Hair" as the play 



that changed the face of American 
Theatre. His 1976 production of 
'Hair' was awarded an invitation to 
perform at the John F. Kennedy 
Center for the Performing Arts in 
Washington, D.C. That year's per- 
formance made the finals of the 
American College Theatre Festival. 

This is Life's 4th production of the 
rock musical. 

Ken Larmore, IPFW student, audi- 
tioned to Harry Chapin's song, 
"Cats in the Cradle." 

Larmore said, "I have not seen the

New women's volleyball coach brings transition 



by Aaron N. Thompson 
Sports Editor 

In the realm of athletics here at 

IPFW, faces change all of the time. 
Athletes graduate, coaches move on 
or injuries end careers before ihey 
gel a chance to blossom. 

Fortunately, (his time the new face 
is a face of positivily. The new face 
is Tim Heffron's and his new posi- 
tion is coach of the women's volley- 
ball learn. 

"I played volleyball here in 
1986-1990 for Arnie. This area is 
like a second home lo me," Heffron 
stated. "I've kept up on IPFW 
athletics." 

Heffron was coaching as a full- 
lime assistant at St. Cloud State in 
Minnesota when he caught word 
that (he IPFW coaching position 
would be available. He quickly 
jumped at the opportunity. 

Heffron said, "I already knew 
everybody here. I knew that the 
school and town has expanded. I 
knew it was an ideal place lo build a 
program." 

Heffron is looking forward to 
many aspects of this job. 

"I am gelling the opportunity to 
build the whole program. I gel to 
help athletes to become well-round- 
ed individuals. I want to increase 
the number of fans," Heffron staled. 
"This job is a challenge to improve 
it." 

Many fans were worried about a 
period of transition in which the 
team will noi fare as well as in re- 
cent years. Heffron believes other- 
wise. 

"With a new coach, there is al- 
ways a period of transition. The 
new coach has a new way of doing 
things and the players have to gel 



used lo il. But Ihc players arc prac- 
ticing well and 1 foresee them doing 
as well as they did last year." 

This ambitious coach comes in 
with high expectations, also. "I ex- 
pect to repeal as regular season 
champs and follow thai with the 
GLVC tournament championship. 
Our players believe in that." 

He also has goals for the next 
three years. 

"I want us lo keep improving (he 
program a little each year. Ncxl 
year, I want us to gel to the top 6 in 
the region," said Heffron. "The year 
after thai, I want us to be in the top 
4 in the region and in (he top 25 in 
the nation. The year after that I want 
us lo be in the top 3 in the region 
and thai will gain us a berth in the 
NCAA tournament." 

Heffron will start this improve- 
ment by "heavily recruiting." He 
has to, however, make due wilh (he 
talent that he has currently. 

Heffron stated, "Jill Lyon is the 
leader of our learn. She's a senior 
and our setter, which is compared (o 
a quarterback in football. She's very 
vocal and a very good setter - she's 
been very well trained. She is a pos- 
itive influence on our team." 

Lyon will be setting lo two of her 
teammates very ofien. These two 
are April Bacr and Heather Teagar- 
den. 

"They are our 'go lo' people to get 
the kill, and (hey have lo handle a 
majority of our offense," said 
Heffron 

Another player that Heffron spoke 
of was Amy Scheumann. "She's 
been a pleasant surprise. She's our 
best passer and backup seller, and 
she's doing a lot of good things." 

Heffron knows the trade well be- 
cause he has played the game on a

competitive level. This is basically 
what got him started. 

"My interest was in playing first. I 
didn't start playing volleyball until 
after high school. I knew my dad 
played volleyball so 1 did loo. The 
more I played ihe more 1 wanted to 
help others. Thai is how I gol my 
interest in coaching." 

Il wasn't an overnight success sto- 
ry for Heffron, either. "I asstsied al 
high school, assisted Ihc Junior 
Olympic team and then came here 
to play. I knew thai my goal was lo 
help ihe learn and I knew I wanted 
lo be a volleyball coach. Here was 
the right training."

Minnesota to conquer with McMahon 



Aaron N. Thompson 
Sports Editor 

As aulumn draws near, armchair 
athletes everywhere begin to antici- 
pate (he upcoming NFL season. 
Whether you sil in "The Dawg 
Pound" in Cleveland Municipal Sta- 
dium every game or you just casual- 
ly root for whoever is winning that 
season, everybody has a prediction. 
1 am not exempt from this stereo- 
type, and since I get the privclege of 
being sports editor of "The Commu- 
nicator," I can write mine down for 
the world to disagree with. 

Let's start with the NFC East, 
which is the division that contains 
the defending Super Bowl champs, 
the Dallas Cowboys, 

I predict that the Cowboys will 
once again come on lop in this divi- 
sion. First of all, they've got a good 
coach in Jimmy Johnson, who has 
resurrected "America's Team." He 
is a bit obsessive with the game and 
has a very abrasive personality, but 
he definitely knows what he is do- 
ing. Secondly, they've got a great, 
young offense featuring the likes of 
Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith. 
Aikman had the game of his life in 
the Super Bowl and is very capable 
of being one of the greatest quarter- 
backs ever, that is, if he can keep 
winning. The Cowboys feature a 
tcrifflc running attack with Smith, 
who last season was horribly under- 
paid compared with backs of his 
calibre in (he rest of the league. He 
agrees with me and now he is hold- 
ing out until he gets a new contract 
worth more money. Without Smith 
in uniform, I don't believe that the 
Cowboys can win the Super Bowl. 

The New York Giants are going 
back to the basics with a new coach. 
Dan Reeves, formerly with the Den- 
ver Broncos, makes his debut with 
the Giants this season. He ended all 
quarterback controversy by letting 
Jeff Hosteller go and and giving the 
start to Phil Simms. Simms has ex- 
perience and an excellent game, but 
may be getting too old to take (he 
shots that the game requires. This 
team features a strong running game 
with Rodney Hampton and has a de- 
cent defense with or without 
Lawrence Taylor. This is a playoff 
team but not a Super Bowl team. 

The Washington Redskins are 
about to fall upon some tough 
times. Last season, they watched 
their starting quarterback Mark 
Rypien go from teriffic the year be- 
fore (o awful. He threw more inter- 
ceptions than he threw touchdowns 
and now his receiving corps has

"/ think that the Vikings will probably win the Super Bowl 
this season. They have what it takes." 



been depleted with the absence of 
Gary Clark. This team does have a 
decent running game and an out- 
standing offensive line, but has an 
aging defense that lacks an impact 
player. They will really struggle to 
make Ihc playoffs. 

The Philadelphia Eagles blew their 
last chance to win a Super Bowl last 
season with Randall Cunningham al 
quarterback. Cunningham has got 
all of the tools, such as a very 
strong arm and excellent scrambling 
ability, to become great. But he 
lacks the decision making ability 
and cool-headedncss in the pocket 
necessary to win it all. He also lacks 
big play receivers. Hcrschel Walker 
was a good addition to the team last 
year, but his star has already faded. 
This team better start looking to 
rebuild. 

The Phoenix Cardinals are an im- 
proving team, but they've still got a 
ways to go. Quarterback Timm 
Rosenbach, who missed almost 
every game last season, retired to 
join the rodeo. He was obviously 
use to hitting the ground a lot in 
Phoenix. The new quarterback will 
be Steve Buerlein, and he has got a 
task set before him. Win, or your 
coach is going to get fired. Joe 
Bugel may be in his last season of 
directing the Cards. This team is 
better than last years, but don't hold 
your breath on the playoffs. 

On to the NFC Central, where the 
Vikings were champions last year. 
This is the season for the Vikings, 
who got their missing ingredient al 
quarterback with Jim McMahon. 

They've got a great running game, a 
great receiver in Anthony Carter. 
and a great second year head coach 



in Dennis Green. They also have a 
mean defense. 1 think that the 

Vikings will probably win the Super 
Bowl this season. They have what it 
takes. 

Green Bay will put the most pres- 
sure on the Vikes this season. The 
Packers just missed the playoffs last 
season as they were ted by rookie 
quarterback Brett Favre. Favrc is a 
winning competitor and has a great 
receiver to throw to, Sterling 
Sharpe. They also picked up free- 
agent Reggie While in the off-sea- 
son to beef up the defense. Second 
year coach Mike Holmgren has the 
Pack on the right track. 

Tampa Bay and Detroit sort of fall 
into the same category. Both are 
struggling who to choose as quarter- 
back, and both arc in a period of 
transition. The Buccaneers arc im- 
proving under coach Sam Wychc, 
but Ihc Lions are in trouble under 
Wayne Fontes. The Lions have the 
best rusher in ihe league wilh Barry 
Sanders, and the Bucs have a com- 
petent runner in Reggie Cobb. How- 
ever, both lack the necessary tools 
to make the playoffs this season. 

Chicago has fallen from it's past 
glory. Things did not go well for 
Ihem last season resulting in the fir- 
ing of longtime coach Mike Ditka. 
Dave Wannesledt, former defensive 
coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys, 
will take the reigns this year as 
coach. This will be another team in 
transition, and will be looking for 
another quarterback this season. 
Ncal Anderson is a great rusher, bul 
he may want out of Chicago after 
this season. The Bears are going lo 
have it rough for a while until 
Wannesledt gets things back on 



The NFC West features the team 
of Ihe 1980's. the San Francisco 
Forty-Niners. If MYP Steve Young 
stays healthy this season, the Niners 
will be right in the hunt for another 
Super Bowl title. He no longer has 
to look over his shoulder for Joe 
Montana, and thai relieves a lot of 
pressure. The Niners also have a 
great running game wilh Ricky Wat- 
(ers and Amp Lee, but have an ag- 
ing defense. They will probably win 
the NFC West, but the Super Bowl 
is a long shot. 

New Orleans has made some ma- 
jor changes in the offseason. They 
released starting quarterback Bobby 
Hebert, and picked up Wade Wil- 
son. This was a smart manuever by 
the Saints, since Hebert single- 
handedly lost the playoff game for 
them last season. The Saint defense 
is good, but it is going to be lacking 
due lo the loss of All- Pro Pat Swill- 
ing. If a playoff win is no! produced 
after this season, Ihen coach Jim 
Mora may be out of a job. They can 
probably do it. 

The Falcons and Rams arc another 

two teams who are in Ihc same boat. 
Both have very potent offenses but 
weak defenses. The Rams feature 
Jim Everett al quarterback and 
"Flipper" Anderson and Henry El- 
lard at Ihe wide receiver positions. 
Atlanta features hard throwing 
Chris Miller and speedster Andre 
Rison. Both can put points on the 
board but can't stop anybody from 
doing the same. This will be a long 
season for both learns and Atlanta 
coach Jerry Glanville may be on his 
way oui. 

Well, like or not, that is how I pic- 
ture the NFC. Grab a copy next 
week lo see what 1 think aboui ihe 
AFC.
