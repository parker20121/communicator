Honors letters never mailed to students 



Class 

cancelled, 

honors 

enrollment 

down 



by Rebecca Kocrdg 
Chief Reporter 

A flaw in the Student Information 



System (SIS) caused 2.000 honors letters 
not to be sent out. These letters were 
intended to inform students with a 3 3 
GPA or higher that they are eligible for the 
program 

The new SIS was not available to print 
the letters according to Virginia Craig, 
director of the honors program. The sys- 
tem was just installed last fall and -till has 
some problems which need to be worked 
out. 

Craig expressed concern to Interim Vice 
Chancellor of Academic Affairs Douglas 
Townsend, in hope that a similar occur- 
rence could be avoided in the future. 

"He knows he did this and it was bad, 



but there wasn't really anything be could 
do and I'm sure it won't happen again," 
said Craig. 

Craig also mentioned computer and data 
processing's (C&amp;DP) role in the letters "I 
am dependent on computer and data pro- 
cessing to send a list and [address] labels 
for honors It was disappointing that the 
mailing didn't go out," Craig said. 

However. Registrar Jack DabI said 
C&amp;DP has little to do with the system 
According to Dahl, the old system address 
labels came from C&amp;DP but in the new 
system, C&amp;DP is only responsible for 
computer services. 

As for future problems with the honors 



program. Dahl said he does not expect any 
"We'll be able lo provide what they (the 
Honors Departmcntl ask for." said Dahl. 

Craig has elected not to send out any 
notification now for the honors program, 
since registration has ended and students 
would be a full week behind their class- 
mates 

The negative effects of the error arc 
clear to the honors program "Film for the 
Common Good" H200 had to be canceled 
due to nearly non-existent enrollment 
Craig said usually the class is one of the 
most popular honors classes offered 
Enrollment in other honors classes has also 
declined this semester. 



One possible alternative for students 
who missed out on honors classes this 
spring is the honors option Selected 
courses can be taken with an honors 
option This means the student takes a 
normal course with non-honors students. 
By adding a project of in-deptb work to the 
curriculum the student will receive honors 
credit for the course. 

Only select classes and professors arc 
participating in the program at present. 
Some, bui not all psychology, civil archi- 
tectural engineering, communications. 
American history, geology, astronomy, 
English, political science and philosophy 
classes offer this option.

E-mail accounts to be available in March 



by Rebecca Koenlg 
Chief Reporter 



E-mail will be available to IPFW students in 
the beginning of March The new system will 
assist students with personal communication In 
addition, many professors plan to use the system 
in their classes. 

The upgrading of IPFW's open-access com- 
puter labs was financed by the new technology 
fee The labs' printers were first to be replaced, 
according to Mary Schoeler, manager of user 
support in the department of computer and data 
processing 

According to Bill Baden, coordinator of acad- 
emic computing also in the department of com- 
puter and data processing, the e-mail system 
should be up and running sometime in early 
March. This came as a disappointment to some 
students who bad hoped for the system in early 
February 

"As an Indiana student at the main campus 
which has e-mail access. 1 hoped IPFW studenis 
would get il also," said Beth Didion. an Indiana 



University student at Bloominglon "Not only is 
e-mail a more cost-effective way to keep in 
touch with friends from home, it also would 
make communication much easier between stu- 
dents doing the same work at different 
campuses." 

The delay in the implementation of e-mail is 
due to the late arrival of certain technical equip- 
ment, according to Baden. The equipment did 
not amve until over the Christmas holiday "We 
had a lime frame that gets adjusted if the equip- 
ment doesn't come in," said Baden "We 
thought we'd get the equipment earlier " 

Another obstacle to the original time frame 
for the installation of tJie e-mail system is per- 
sonnel. "Student technology money may not be 
used at all for people." said Schoeler This 
means no additional staff can be used to assist in 
setting up the e-mail system. The staffing diffi- 
culties have increased due to the loss of some 
key people in the project, according to Schoeler 

The equipment to which Baden referred is a 
HP UNIX system, capable of containing the 
1200 simulations accounts necessary to run (he 
e-mail system, according to Schoeler The sys- 



tem is about half the size of a refrigerator and 
contains a tape backup in case problems arise 
later. 

Pine-mail, the e-mail system to be used at 
IPFW. was developed at the University of 
Washington. In order to adapt the system to 
IPFW some minor changes will be made. An 
instructional video for the system will be avail- 
able for student use 

Most students are not likely to use the new e- 
mail system according to Baden He estimates 
only 20 to 30 percent of students will use the 
feature. The system is still a valuable improve- 
ment, according to Baden "I think anytime you 
improve communication on a campus it's a 
plus," said Baden 

The best way to prepare for the new e-mail 
system is to work with Netscape, the Internet 
browser available in the computer labs, accord- 
ing to Schoeler The e-mail system will be 
accessed through Netscape The system should 
be easy to use according to Schoeler, although 
she expects to see at least some students strug- 
gling with the new equipment 

"Be Patient It'll be bere," said Schoeler.

she added 

According to William Ludwin. 
assistant dean and director of the 
school of public and environmen- 
tal affairs (SPEA), the department 
handles its evaluations differently 
than most departments. 

"All of our evaluauons are sent 
lo Indy where they are compiled 
centrally with the other four 
SPEA campuses We are sent 
reports which compare our scores 
with everyone in SPEA. Then we 
just learn to interpret those 
remarks," Ludwin said. 

Townsend said he was not sure 
if having the form available to 
studenis would help them There 
may be another way to accom- 
plish the task, he said"

Hillary saga is a trip down a familiar road 

Nancy Reagan played by the same rules 



Questions of doing wrong and 
unethical practices continue to 
plague the White House, as First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
answers to those who think she mis- 
used her husband's title in unautho- 
rized ways. 

Before you judge Mrs. Clinton, 
we have just Iwo words for you. . 
Nancy Reagan 

In the 1980s. Nancy Reagan 
wore the pants in the White House 
In public, she told us to "say no lo 
drugs." But behind closed doors. 
she cracked the whip She spent a 
fonune in tax dollars on new cbina 
for the White House She consulted 



with astrologers and then insisted 
that her husband, our president, the 
leader of the free world follow the 
advice of these people (ya-hoos). 
sometimes even to the point of 
affecting presidential decisions She 
is even rumored to have fired the 
White House Chief of Staff (sound 
familiar?). 

What we have here is clearly an 
unequal comparison. Nancy Reagan 
accepted gorgeous gowns by 
famous designers and held big 
Hollywood parties for every in-ihe- 
moment celebrity. She appeared to 
be the woman's woman, one wbo 
was looked up to by many women, 



as well as their husbands 

Hillary Clinton is a different 
woman. She's pretty, but sensible 
with ber looks She's intelligent and 
uses it She works bard to make a 
change for everybody, but mostly 
for women Republicans hate (his 
and hate her (Ask Newt's mother) 
They can't stand that Bill doesn't 
keep her barefoot and pregnant or at 
least limit her to speaking only at 
Housewives-R-Us meetings 

Hillary Rodham Clinton may 
have done nothing wrong With 
Whitewater, she made a bad invest- 
ment — who hasn't? With firing 
travel personnel, if she doesn't have 



the authority to do so, why was it 
done? Someone should have said. 
"Look lady, you don't have that 
power You're not the president." 
We do not want to leave you with 
the impression that we think Hillary 
should be a quiei little den mother, 
but in this case sbe should realize 
what her position is--FIRST 
LADY. Not President. 

Bill Clinton has shown amazing 
strength through all this Nol only 
has he continued to support his 
wife, he has taken a iraditional 
"hold-me-back" approach to pro- 
tecting his wife To quote Martha 
Stewart, "That's a good thing." 



Scholarship should be named after deserving graduate 



We bad a heated conversation 
amongst ourselves in the 
Communicator over the Lloy Ball 
Scholarship The big question at 
hand was this: should a student who 
never graduated from IPFW, but 
made an important contribution to 
the athletics department, have a 
scholarship named after him? 

It's a reality The Lloy Ball 
Volleyball Scholarship was funded 



by a private donor and will specifi- 
cally go to an individual seeking to 
play volleyball at IPFW Lloy Ball, 
you should know, was an outstand- 
ing player for four years and has tbe 
rare opportunity of participating in 
Ibis summer's Olympic games in 
Atlanta. But in those four years at 
IPFW. he never gained enough 
credits to obtain a degree. 

There is no technical rule that 



says the namesake of a scholarship 
has to graduate from that school; 
they're not even required to have 
visited the campus. 

As college students, most would 
agree that a scholarship recipient 
would nol care where the money 
came from as long as the money 
was clean, or who it was named 
after But wouldn't it have been 
great to have the scholarship named 



after someone who wasn't just a 
great player of whatever sport, but 
was able to finish the whole game, 
as wc are all trying so hard lo do? 

We are just thankful that there is 
no Mark Souder "I Don't Really 
Represent the People of Fort 
Wayne" Scholarship. 



Letters to the editor 



Mark Souder is tobacco's best friend 



To the editor: 

Laws against dangerous illegal 
drugs like cocaine and heroine gen- 
erally include stronger punishments 
against the pushers than those 
meted out to the consumers of that 
which the pushers push. 

In the case of dangerous legal 
drugs like tobacco in cigarettes 
however, the situation is reversed; 



smokers receive extremely harsh 
penalties through lung, mouth, 
throat and other cancers, bronchitis, 
emphysema and heart diseases, 
while tobacco executives wbo push 
the drug just get richer off tbose 
they book and destroy. 

Why is this? Largely, because 
money takes precedence over 
morals in politics today. Just look at 



Rep Mark Souder, for example. 

Souder is not bothered by moral 

considerations when it comes to 

money He eagerly rakes in tobacco 

drug money, and fights like a crack 

dealer guarding his turf to ensure 

his tobacco-pimps get their deccp- Andrea Parker

If cocaine and heroine were 



legal, Souder would probably have 
iwo more powerful and deadly 
interests dumping dollars in his re- 
election campaign, in exchange for 
services rendered

The identity crisis 







I recently had a new In end who 
can'! be more than six years my 
senior say to me, "I identify myself 
as a Jew " This prompted some 
thought, but only briefly I won- 
dered how I should identity myself 
but then moved on to the next 
thoughi without answering. 

Within days, I was asked to do 
the same thing, but this time as a 
class assignment. I was instructed 
to make a culture map of my per- 
sonal identity with my most impor- 
tant characteristic/culture represen- 
tation at the top of the list. 
Although this assignment would not 
be seen by anyone, I started to fret. 
Here a professor — a babyboomer I 
might add — was asking me ro 
label myself, a task my generation 
has never been fond of. 

Think back to when Douglas 
Coupland wrote a book about us 
called "Generation X." a title which 
was applied to our generation with- 
out our consent Boomers took it 
one step further by labeling us as 
incompetent and unable to handle 
life outside our parents' living 
room I'm sorry, but I cannot relate 
(o this stereotype. 1 have two jobs, 
thinccn hours of classes, and a pos- 
sible internship in the works. I hard- 
ly consider this life the life of a 
slacker. 

Fast forward about two years 
Inter when Kurt Cobain shot him- 
self. Many boomers labeled the 
tragedy: "The day the voice of 
Generation X died " Cobain did not

that said, I can 
only conclude that babyboomcrs 
have some obsessive need to label 
everything. Maybe that's why they

don't want to say I identify myself 
as being white because so many 
whites insist on dominating the

to me. I don't want to identify 
myself as an American because of 
the United States' hypocrisy 
towards immigrants hoping for a 
better life (The great melting pot no 
longer welcomes many of the ingre- 
dients that made it great).

Clinton, president of the United 
States and self-imposed demigod of 
the present federal budget battle, 
actually stands to be re-elected in 
ten months, despite bis nominal 
public approval rating 

Ihe president owes much of his 
new lease on life to Newt Gingrich 
After defending the new Speaker of

I am disappointed by his handling 
of the recent budget debate. It 
behooves the public lo remember 
that the fighting over Ihe nation's 
finances is •nil a political game, 
not a business affair. Bill Clinton 
has not forgotten this unseemly 
fact; some veteran Republicans 
have. 

As one who remains as uncom-

stand on a pseudo-pedestal as the 
savior of a myriad of ill-begotten

Scary as

A handful

and just as 
significantly, 
than a 
mere 

of Democrats 
have rccog- ._ -_^_»_^__ 
m/ed that the 

president still does not represent 
over fifty percent of the American 
voter population. A willingness by 
the Republicans to step once in the 
Dems' direction would allow them 
to gamer a two-thirds majority in 
the House, enough to override a 
presidential veto or force him to 



forego the veto, cither of which is a 
tremendous blow to hi&gt; tv -election 
campaign. 

Clinton has promised lo disal- 
low cuts in Medicare or Welfare II 
he were to be overridden, his prvsi 
dency would be viewed as inept as 
it was when assailed with a rash of 
failed presidential appointments 

If. on the other hand, he were to 
refuse to veto a Republican-pro- 
posed budget, he would be seen a.\ 
going back on his word My guess 
is he would choose the latter mule. 
he ha.-, been caught double-talking 
belore and avoided any fatal shots 
to his presidency. 

What is more, the GOP can gain 
the upper hand, It won a congres- 
sional majority on a promise of 
change, now

Caring for IPFW's children 

Day care center helps IPFW students 
juggle family with gaining an education 




Auslio, 4, tries his memory skills in a match game with caregiver 
Brian Bigelow 



by Janet Tobey 
Staff Writer 

For students who have young 
children, a dependable day care 
center means everything. 

IPFW'l Child Care Center pro- 
vides just that convenience and 
dependability, said Michelle 
Amick. a sophomore nursing stu- 
dent who brings her daughter Ton 
to the Center 

"You can sit in class, listen to 
the lecture and not worry about 
your child," said Amick. "1 am a 
single mom, so it has helped me 
out a lot." 

The children enrolled at the 
Child Care Center, ages 2-12. 
scamper about playing with blocks 
and puzzles, zooming toy trucks 
and interacting with the caregivers 

The toys and games arc child- 
hood classics: beads to siring. 
Memory (remember thai game?) 
and Eich-A-Sketch. The children 
create works of art wiib clay, mark- 
ers, crayons and paint 

Staff, such as Angela Zalac. an 
IPFW sludeni majoring in psychol- 
ogy, guide iheir play. For Ihe chil- 
dren three years of age and 
younger, there is about one staff 
member for every sin children. For 
children four to len. ibe Center has 
a ratio of one caregiver for every 
ten children. 

"We do a lot or training with our 
staff Most of ihcm are IPFW slu- 
dents. majoring in early childhood 
education or in a related Field." said 
Janine Fetters, director of ihe cen- 



"We have a daily routine thai ihe 
kids follow and planned activities 
that are based on child develop- 
ment So each day they will be 
offered activities geared toward 
social skills, self esieem or lan- 
guage." said Fetters "The teachers 



really focus on helping the kids 
wilh self-esteem and feeling good 
about themselves. We work on bow 
to guide kids' behavior in a positive 
way." 

Other activities include creative 
art and music and working with 
cognitive skills and motor skills. 



"All of the different areas are 
covered every day with the kids," 
said Fetters. 

The Child Care Center, which 
opened m August, was a product of 
the joint ven- 
ture by ^~ ^~ ^^^— 
Student 
Government 
and the uni- 
versity. 

Before the 
center 
opened, no 
child care 
had been 
available for 
two years. 

Fetters said 
the caregivers 
provide sup- 
port for ihe 

parents, who ^^^^_^^^_^ 
have to juggle 
raising chil- 
dren, attending classes and often 
holding down a job. 

"I think the caregivers are reaJly 
supportive of the parents and their 
needs. We belp them know they are 
not alone and we are here lo listen." 
said Fetters. 



A loi of students have said they 

would be unable to attend classes if 

the center did not exist, said Fetters. 

"We really want to be a service 

to the students." said Fetters "That 

is our goal."

Center, which 
is located on 



"The teachers really &lt;°e comer of

kids with 

self-esteem and 

feeling good about 

themselves, " said

for children 
ages 2-12. 

The cost 
is S2.10 per 
hour for the 
first child,

additional 
child, and a

semester reg- 
istration fee 
Drop-in care is provided also, at a 
cost of S3 per hour per child, for 
those who are not enrolled. 

Some students may have heard 
that they may leave their children at 
the Child Care Center for only four 
hours per day !n fact, said Fetters, 
the only limitation is that care is 
offered only 20 hours per week.

Finding friends on the Net 

2 l h hours of chatting leads to an invitation to England 



by Andrew Voder 
Staff Writer 

"Docs anyone warn lo hear a 
joke?" 1 ask the group 

"Ye*, bui keep ii clean," says a 
person who colli, himself "Boucl." 

I begin, "A guy walks into a bar 
and say* OUCH!" 

"Pis* off. Drew," counters 
Botlel 

I am silting in the basement of 
Ncff Hall chatting with new-found 
friends from around the world. The 
person who calls himself "Bottel" is 



from Belgium Sandy is from 
Africa, and bcr friend UK is from 
England. We are aJI sitting around 
behind computer terminals, com- 
municating via the Internet. We are 
in the Web Ever chat room on the 
World Wide Web talking about 
school, work and where good par- 
ties are in our respective countries 

Two people, Hans and JK, sign 
on to the chat room and begin typ- 
ing in a language that looks like 
their keyboards are experiencing 
major electronic malfunction We 
find out later thai the language was 



Dutch; Haas and JK were planning 
to visit each other to party next 
weekend 

"If anyone is in the neighbor- 
hood [England) and wants to slop 
by. I have a great apartment you can 
live in as long as you like." UK 
says He is lonely. He invites any of 
his brand new friends to visit bis 
native England. 

Conversation turns to travel 1 
type in. "UK&gt;Are you serious about 
your offer?" I tell him I am going to 
Europe in February and would like 
to visit him A person who signs on 



as Anonymous replies for UK: 
"He's not serious you idiot, don't 
believe everything you read!" 

UK corrects tbe errant 
Anonymous with. "Of course 1 am 
serious; here is my e-mail address 
Please write me soon to discuss 
details" 

I realize I am making new 
friends as quickly as I can bang the 
keyboard My heart races, adrena- 
line surges through my veins "Has 
anyone ever been surfing in 
Australia' 1 " 1 ask hopefully Botlel 
says he never has but would like to 



someday 

Two hours have passed My 
Saturday is slowly draining away, 
but I cannot sign off 1 need to face 
(be facts I am addicted. After 
another ihiny minutes, 1 pry myself 
away from ihc keyboard I look for- 
ward with eagerness lo the next 
lime I can "surf tbe Net." 

For those of you who nave heard 
of the Internet chat rooms and never 
taken advantage of their many ben- 
efits, I can only say: Try it! Anyone 
can access the chat rooms, as long 
as World Wide Web access is avail- 



able One of the great things about 
the rooms is that having an e-mail 
account is unnecessary Just hop on 
a search engine, enter in "chat 
rooms" and begin to wander Oner 
planted in a room, choose .i handle 
(name) for yourself and babble with 
your new-found cronies. You can 
rest assured 1 will be chatting away 
again as soon as I finish my twelve- 
step program in "Nctsurfaholics 
Anonymous."

by Amanda Maninn 
Features- Editor

dismal gray and temperatures may 
feel tub-zero, but inside on the 
Purdue Indiana Theater stage, 
spring has officially arrived. The 
theater will present four different 
productions during its spring sea- 
Kicking off the second half of 
the Studio Theater Productions.

story of young love, age, and the 
human spirit "The Fantastics" runs

Theatre in Keltler Hall at 8 p.m. 

Later in tbe month, "Equus"

a drama of psychological mystery, 
concerning a boy who has blinded 



six horses The psychiatrist in the 
production must find the root of the 
boy's problems and attempt 10 alle- 
viate bis pain. The production has 
been described by the PIT as "a 
compelling and deeply moving 
evening in the theatre that con- 
fronts the drives that lead human 
beings to crucify themselves." PIT 
presents "Equus" Feb. 23 and 24 
and Mar 1 and 2 at in tie Williams 
Theater ai 8 p.m. 

Continuing PIT's productions in

Studio Theatre at 8 p.m. 

Finishing off PIT's thirtieth 
anniversary season, the company 
presents the energy packed "A 
Chorus Line" Filled with incredi- 
ble choreography, the "greatest of 
contemporary musicals" tells a 
story of the backbone of any musi- 
cal production — the chorus mem- 
bers. It is a story of performers 
with unfailing spirit, a story of 
competition and a story of strength, 
desire and the will to succeed and 
shine "A Chorus Line" runs Apr. 
12. 13, 19, 20. 26 and 27 at 8 pjn 

PIT is already hard at work on 
their first production. If you are 
searching for a night of theater, 
look no further than your own cam- 
pus. 



Miss Haute Couture searches 
for the Fort's fashion sense 



by Haute Couture 
Staff Writer 

My dear friends, in this world 
there are two kinds of people: those 
who know how to dress (fashion 
do's) and those who do not (fashion 
don' is) Obviously, the focus of this 
column will be on those people 
who commit fashion do's and fash- 
ion don'ts 

Unfortunately. 1 have lost my 
Prcppie Handbook, which was 
probably published in the early 
eighties when Yuppies. Atari, 
Bananarama, Swatches. Karl 
Lagerfcld's CHANEL, Madonnas 
lace lank topes, tight skirts, black 
fingerless gloves were in, the over- 
ly pastel Miami Vice look was chic, 
Imelda Marcos' closet contained 
3,000 shoes, or so. and Ralph 
Lauren's Polo trademark made a 
splash, especially with the collars

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. What's the point of 
HIV testing? If you've 
got HIV, you're going to 
die "before your time" 
and why would anyone 
want to know that? 

A Medicines are now 
available that can prolong 
the period of good health 
and prevent illness in 
people with HIV. Better 
treatments and possibly a 
cure may be found before 
those now infected get sick 
or die. Also, if you are 
infected, you must take 
precautions not to infect 
others.

turned up. 

Well, if one recalls, it is 1996. 
Nowadays all of Uic fashion talk 
centers around tbe words grunge, 
alternative, generation X, retro, etc 
Yet Polo, Tommy Hilfiger, Banana 
Republic. J Crew, Ann Taylor and 
Ambcrcrombie &amp; Fitch are big best 
sellers in today's fashion market 
(Notice that the latter four DO NOT 
have stores in Fort Wayne This of 
course means that Fort Wayne is 
slightly five to seven years behind 
in preppie fashion, among other 
things .) Anywhoo's, back to ihe 
matter at hand, 1996. "What about 
it?" you ponder lo yourself Well, I 
think that anyone who wants to 
wear whatever, does But is that 
being fashion conscious? 

This question will be answered 
in the weeks to follow with pictures 
to aid me in my critique of fashion 
in the Fort. If you know of anyone 



who, in your opinion, is a walking

Cowboys 

poised 

to rule NFL 

once again 



Woodson's 
surgically 
repaired knee. 
Woodson also 
[ends ro bile 
on double 
moves intend- 
ed to make 
the big play, 
once again 
leaving him 
open to the long ball Another key 
matchup in the passing game will 
be the Steelers linebackers against 
Jay Novacek and Daryl Johnston. 
While Pittsburgh's backers are 
probably the best in the NFL they 
have trouble covering receivers out 
of the hackficld and have been vic- 
timized by throws to the lightcnd 
Result: Cowboys quarterback 
Troy Aikman will once again shine 
promises to differ in one regard in die SuperBowl spotlight, 
from those blasts from the past - The third advantage that the 

the score. Pittsburgh has notched Cowboys own over Pittsburgh is in 
two SuperBowl victories over the 
Cowboys, hut (or the twelfth 
straight year the NFC will once 
again triumph. 

The Cowboys have the advan- 
tage in three decisive categories 
that wdl give them their third tide 
in four years. First is the Dallas 
offensive line against the 
Pittsburgh front seven. In particu- 
lar, Dallas offensive tackle Eric 
Williams against Pittsburgh outside 
linebacker Kevin Greene. After 
manhandling Reggie While in the 
NFC Championship game, it 
appears that Williams is finally 
fully recovered from the knee 
injury that sidelined him for most 
of last season. Going against the 
undersized Greene. Williams will 
be able to open up running lanes 
for NFL rushing leader Emmitt 
Smith. With Williams being able 
to handle Greene without help, All- 
Pro guard Larry Allen will be free 
to go after Pittsburgh's inside line- 
backers. Result: Smith will rush 
for close to 125 yards capturing his 
second SuperBowl MVP. 

The second matchup in which 
the Cowboys have the advantage is 
the Dallas wide receivers against 
the Rod Woodson-less Pittsburgh 
secondary. No Steelers defensive 
back is physical enough to match 
Michael Irvin, except Woodson. If 
Woodson does play, look for Irvin 




From the 
"^1 Locker Room... 

with 
Lindy Jones 



Finally a reason to praise the 
football gods For the first lime in 
five years we may actually be able 
to view a game worthy of the title 
"SuperBowl " The Dallas 
Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers 
will once again renew those epic 
battles of the 1970s in this year's 
SuperBowl in Tempc. Ariz. While 
diehard football fans dig out old 
memories of Btadshaw. Harris, 
Staubach and Dorset! this game 



If you were to look up the word 
humble in an unabridged dictio- 
nary, you would probably find a 
picture of Lindy Jones. 

The younger sister of a former 
basketball standout at Purdue, bas- 
ketball talent must run in the Jones' 
family 

"We really didn't play together a 
lot. He's seven years older than I 
am." Jones said of her older brother 
Kip. "I just warned lo achieve my 
own thincs, and 1PFW was a good 
choice forme." 

The senior co-captain of the 
women's basketball team is the 
epitome of the word humiliy, For 
all of her individual skills and 
accomplishments. Jones is quick to 



point to ber teammaics and the suc- 
cess of the team as a whole 

During a season in which the 
team has yet to lose, its record cur- 
rently stands at 14-0, Jones is at a 
loss for words when asked to 
describe her most memorable per- 
sonal achievement. 

"I don't really think a whole lot 
about thai," Jones said. "I just like 
to play basketball. The awards .1 
have just been fortunate enough to 
achieve." 

In reality fortune and her skills 
as one of the best players in the 
country have earned Jones the 
accolades. Last season Jones was 
honored as one of the best women's 
players in the country by the Kodak 
Company An honorable mention 
All-Amcrican, Jones may well 
achieve the upper echelon of First 



Team All-American at 
the conclusion of this season 

Jones leads the GLVC in scoring 
with a 23 4 points per game aver- 
age. Last week she poured in 62 
points in wins over Kentucky 
Wesleyan and Southern Indiana to 
lead the 'Dons Her accomplish- 
ments have earned her Player of the 
Week honors three limes thus far 
this season. 

Still, Jones takes little outward 
pride in her accomplishments 

"1 think my stepdad lakes more 
pride in my achievements than 1 
do," Jones said "He's the one who 
calls me to tell me about the awards 
and stuff" 

Jones' humility and skill have 
helped the 'Dons to achieve the 
success of a currently unblemished 
season. But wiih all of the current 



accomplishments, many of which 
have never before been witnessed 
at IPFW. there is still a sense of 
unfinished bllsinCtt with Junes 

"I don't really ilimk about it (the 
team's 14-0 start thus far). I just 
want lobe 15-0 then 16-0 ..." Jones 
said. "I don't want to dwell on what 
we have accomplished. After ihe 
season we can sit back and enjoy 




the Steelers passing game When 
Pittsburgh uses their five wide 
receiver set, Dallas will counter 
with their nickel package putting 
Dcion Sanders on Yancy Thigpen. 
That means Steelers quarterback 
Neil O'Donnell will have lo find a 
second and third receiver which 
could be a problem. Dallas defen- 
sive end Charles Haley will be pit- 
ted once again against Pittsburgh 
tackle Joe Jackson who has trouble 
with pass protection. Haley will be 
in the back field on every play. 
which means O'Donnell better find 
those receivers in a hurry Result: 
Haley will have two or three sacks 
and become the first player with 
five SuperBowl rings. 

For those people who are not 
Cowboy fans, or who don'i want to 
sec another blowout in the 
SuperBowl, you may want to put 
the children to bed early because 
this one could get ugly. The 
Cowboys are on a roll much like 
they were two years ago, and you 
can see the desire in (heir eyes. 
With two weeks to gel completely 
healthy, Dallas is going to be nm- 
on all cylinders. Result: 
Cowboys 37 - Steelers 17.

Harbaugh proves to be a hero for all 

This in a worid short of heros and heroines

H JO 


Porter

Ucacicu 



Finally, in today's world of • 
look at me, I am the bcM and you 
can'i deny il - sports, we have a 
hero worthy of praise 

He has no superfluous touch- 
down dance, his celebrations arc 



much more 
reserved. You 
won't sec him 
ripping off his 
helmet and 
strutting across 
Ihc field. In 
fact, his perfor- 
mance is rarely 
more than a 
point toward 
the heavens 
and an occa- 
sional prayer. 
The 
media dubbed him "Captain 
Comeback". Appropriately. Jim 
Harbaugh nearly pulled off the 
biggest upset of this century He led 
a band of so-called "also-rans" to 
in with a fingertip grab of 



SuperBowl XXX. Yes, even in 
defeat he exhibited a level of class 
seemingly extinct in professional 
sports 

Harbaugh, a devout Christian, 
often acknowledges accolades with 
praise for his Lord and savior. He 
said i( best last weekend after the 
Colts were narrowly defeated in the 
ALF Championship game at 
Pittsburgh. 

"God doesn't care about foot- 
ball," Harbaugh said. "But he docs 
give us blessings, bke this season " 

Yes he does, Jimbo We should 
all be thankful for men of your cal- 
iber. 

Today's multi-million dollar 
contracts and huge commercial 
endorsements seem to weed out the 
humble players, instead highlight- 



ing the controversial ones 
Harbaugh's humility has provided a 
breath of fresh air and even remind- 
ed some that it is only a game, A 
game played by big boys who. no 
matter bow heb and greedy, can 
never purchase the most precious 
treasure of all 

After coming within literal inch- 
es of one of football's greatest 
upsets. Harbaugh once again gave 
thanks. There was no whining, no 
complaining. No "we got rooked by 
the ref ' comments were uttered by 
the Colls number 4. Instead, 
Harbaugh discussed the blessing of 
the wonderful season bestowed 
upon him and his teammates 

It made non-controversial, 
down-to-earth copy for writers A 
possible explanation for the 



absence of his commenis from 
many accounts of the game 

Conversely, the winners in the 
NFC were full of dance, taunting 
and a lofty air of arrogance It was 
enough to make most anyone sick 

There is nothing wrong with cel- 
ebrating, even taking it to the limit 
now and then. It docs get old, how- 
ever, when it becomes predictable 

Sure, I am happy for the Stcelen 
and their fans Pittsburgh probably 
has a better chance of upending the 
Cowboys anyway Who knows. 
SuperBowl XXX may even prove 
to be the affair it will no doubt be 
hyped to be There will be a 
refreshing piece of the game that 



will be missed, though 

It is rare we experience the 
humility and competitive drive that 
personifies Jim Harbaugh His 
chapter of the Super Bowl annals 
would have proved interesting 
Alas, it was not to be: it wasn't pan 
of God's plan Then again, "God 
doesn't care about fooihall." but he 
does give us blessings, such as Jim 
Harbaugh and other men of his cal- 
iber who arc unashamed to display 
their Godly character and devotion 

Take it as you will Just remem- 
ber, no matter how big or good you 
think you are. there will always be 
someone big enough to set you on 
the seat of your pants

Senior co-captain Lindy Jones 
continues to lead Ihc women's bas- 
ketball team on a crusade through 
the GLVC. Jones is the conference 
leader in scoring, as well as steals, 
and is third on die three-point Field 
goal percentage list She also ranks 
second behind teammate Leah 
Sheets on the free throw percentage 
list. Sheets is hitting on an incredi- 
ble 88 percent of her charity shots. 



while Jones has tallied an 85 per- 
cent proFicency from the free throw 
stripe. 

Other 'Dons ranked among the 
conference bests in various statisti- 
cal categories include Tara 
Mtizzlllo who is averaging 6.3 
rebounds per game She is also 
swatting almost a block per game 
from her post position. 

Last week Jones averaged 31 



points in a pair of wins for the 

Mastodons and was named the 
GLVC Player of the Week for the 
third week this season. She is prov- 
ing once again that her caliber of 
play can match any number of 
players in the country as she makes 
a bid for a second All-Amencan 
honor.

The men's volleyball team 
kicked off its season with a confer- 
ence win over new MIVA member 
Montana State-Billings. Brad 
Prieditis led the way with nine 
kills, while Justin Luna, Mike Ter 
Molen and Javier Escobar had si* 
kills each. Escobar electrified the 
home crowd with his 42-inch verti- 
cal jump and prowess at the net. 

In the second match of the sea- 
son, the Mastodons dropped a 3-1 



decision to Canada's defending 
national champion Manitoba. 
Although the team lost, there was a 
new sense of pride and tenacity that 
has been absent from the Gates 
Center for quite some lime. 

Pneditis again led the Dons as 
he tallied 12 kills and nine digs 
Escobar finished with nine kills 
Ricardo Soler had 35 assists in the 
match.
