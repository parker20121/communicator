NEWS BRIEFS 

STUDENT SENATE FAILS 
TO MAKE QUORUM AGAIN 

For llie third time in as many weeks, the IPFW stu- 
dent senate was unable to hold an official meeting. 

Of tlie 14 student senators, seven were present for 
the March 26 meeting. Also absent was John 
Weisenburger, vice president of legislation and the 
presiding officer of the senate. 

Weisenburger said that car trouble left him stranded 
in Indianapolis on the day of the meeting. 

The senators present held an informal discussion on 
what they felt was wrong with student senate and 
IPSGA affairs. Student body president Krisiina 
Frazier-Henry offered comments and directed ques- 
tions to the senators. 

Student body president-elect Rajat Suri was also on 
hand to observe. 

Senators present at the meeting were: Tad 
Atkinson. Cheryl Hanley. Kent Jakway, Robert 
Murray. Tyra Richardson. Victoria Vinson, and 
Elben Webster. 

By-laws regarding student senate meetings require 
that half the number of active senators, plus one 
more, must be present before legislation may be dis- 
cussed. A voting quorum must be present for com- 
mittee reports to be submitted. 

The next student senate meeting will be held on 
Aprils.

will conduct the concen. 

The Symphonic Winds is the premier instrumental 
organization at the university. The 44-member 
ensemble is open to qualified students, regardless of 
major. 

The Winds regularly perform concerts on campus, 
in the community, and during IPFW commencement. 

In the past five years the Winds has attracted guest 
conductors Robert Jager, Vito di Salvo, Elliot Del 
Borgo, and William Revelli. 

MATH INSTRUCTOR OFFERS 
TIPS FOR FUTURE TEACHERS 

The lecture "Things about Teaching that You don't 
Leam in Class" will feature Marjorie Keever. a math 
teacher at Northrop High School. The lecture will be 
held on April 3, at noon in Kettler Hall, Room 24 1 . 

Keever graduated from IPFW and will discuss 
information she picked up through teaching that she 
didn't learn in her classes here on campus, said 
Lowell Beineke, professor of mathematics. 

■'She is not going to focus strictly on mathematics 
leaching, and I think any student would enjoy what 
she has to say about being in class. But, obviously, 
the students who will be most interested are those 
studying math or considering teaching as a career," 
said Beineke. 

The IPFW student chapter of the Mathematical 
Association of America and the math club Pi will 
sponsor the event. 

The lecture will be free and open to the public. 
Refreshments will be served.

Officials offer conflicting stories on fuel tank 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Feature Editor 

No one seems to agree about 
what happened to ilic contami- 
nated soil near (he site of the 
Engineering and Technology 
Building, or what happened to 
the fuel lank thai supposedly 
leaked into the soil. 

There only seem to be more 
questions. 

Richard Dirrim, supehniendcnt 
of grounds al IPFW, said the soil 
beneath the building was not 
contaminated. 

"We determined thai the soil 
was noi conlaminalcd. Wc sent 
soil samples to two or three dif- 
ferent laboratories and they 
found nothing." said Din-im, 

He also said that Purdue-West 
Lafayette look the samples to 
analyze the soil. He said offi- 
cials al the main campus headed 
the project, and decided there 



was nothing contaminating the 
soil. 

The soil, Dirrim said, was 
removed and spread out on the 
McKay farm across the river 
which is owned by ihc universi- 
ty. This was done as a precau- 
tionary procedure in case the 
soil tcsl results showed danger- 
ous levels of petroleum, said 
Dirrim. 

However, Bill Byers, con- 
struction supervisor for all 
Purdue campuses, said the labs 
in West Lafayciic tested the soil, 
and the results did reveal a 
contamination, 

"The lab reports said the soil 
contained a petroleum-based 
product." Byers explained. He 
added the soil was not flamma- 
ble or explosive. 

The spill is believed to have 
come from a fuel tank buried at 
the site of ihe building cuircndy

Professors say advising 
is just part of the job 



By Mary Shrock 
Staff Writer 

For students who arc fresh- 
men, returning students, or 
transfer students, the firsi 
person they probably mec l 
al IPFW is an academic 
counselor. 

Depending on whether a stu- 
dent has a declared major, 
[here are a variety of advisors 
to counsel students. 

Student Academic Counsel- 
ing Services advises people 
who are undecided. SACS is 
also involved with students 
who are in die guided studies 
program or who arc pre -busi- 
ness students. 

In the School of Arts and 
Sciences, advisors take care of 
fir^I ^pmeitf.r nr remedial 
requirements. 

The School of Arts and 
Sciences has two main advi- 
sors, academic counselor, Jim 
Hosteller and assistant dean, 
Rudy Svoboda. 

"We see all new students, gel 
their records established, and 
then move on to iheir depart- 
ments for an advisor," said 
Hosteuer. 

"I have been involved for a 
long time, and 1 don't advise 
just certain majors. It's a diffi- 
cult job to advise people in all 
academic areas." Hosteller 



said. 

The responsibility for leach- 
ers to be deparunental advisers 
is part of the job, but for acad- 
emic advisers it isn't a require- 
ment of die job that diey leach. 

Svoboda said he used to like 
teaching bui the added respon- 
sibility of advising put a con- 
straint on his ability to be an 
effective teacher. Now 
Svoboda concentrates solely on 
his advising. 

Advisors like Hosteller and 
Svoboda aren'l the only indi- 

"It's considered a fac- 
ulty responsibility to 
advise, " 
•Jim Hosteller 



viduals who give students aca- 
demic counseling. 

Frederick Kirchhoff, depart- 
ment chair of English, said he 
often talks with new students 
as an infomial way of advising. 
"We're concerned wilh getting 
the requirements carried out." 
he said. 

Part of a professor's job is 
also being a departmental advi- 
sor, according to Hosteller. 

"It's considered a faculty 
responsibility to advise." 
Hosteller said. 



under construction. 

Stuart Kline, head of radiologi- 
cal and environmental manage- 
ment ai Purdue-West Lafayette, 
said Ihe lank was removed 
before IPFW existed. He also 
said any contamination to the 
soil occurred before that time. 

"1 believe it was concluded 
thai llie spill was not a threat," 
said Kline. 

He said the Indiana Depart- 
ment of Environmental Manage- 
ment was notified to help figure 
out what had to be done to dis- 
pose of the soil. 

Although Kline and Byers 
agreed that Ihe tank must have 
been removed before the univer- 
sity existed, they say great 
efforts were taken to locale the 
missing lank. 

Both Kline and Byers said they 
also searched extensively for 
any other possible tanks in the 



area. Don Kattcr, IPFW physical 
plant director, headed this search 
but was unable to be reached for 
comment as he was on vacation 
this week. 

Byers added, "Wc never 
removed a tank, Wc looked all 
over, but never found one." 
Although both Kiinc and Byers 
say there are currendy no tanks 
in the area, Cindy Brewer sug- 
gested otherwise. 

Brewer, a clerk wilh die Office 
of the State Fire Marshall 
Deparimeni, said a permit was 
issued to remove a waste oil 
tank from IPFW's property on 
March 2. 1992. 

During a subsequent interview 
Brewer said a permit was never 
issued to remove a tank. Instead 
she said Fire Marshall officials 
were asked to come lo IPFW for 
an inspection. 

However, Brewer said, to her 



knowledge, die inspection never 
took place. But she did name T- 
G Incorporated as the company 
mcndoncd in her reports. 

T-G Incorporated, located on 
Hugucnard Road in Fort Wayne, 
was handling an underground 
fuel lank problem on campus, 
according to Brewer. 

No one at the Fire Marshal's 
office could explain how they 
knew the contents of Ihe lank. 

T-G Incorporated said they had 
no records of any files dealing 
wilh IPFW in recent years. 

Although Kline said IDEM 
was consulted on the disposal of 
the soil, IDEM also said they 
have no record of anydiing relat- 
ed lo IPFW. 

Byers added, "We shouldn't 
blow diis problem out of propor- 
tion. Wc shouldn't speculate on 
things wc really aren'i sure of." 



Friend claims murder suspect 
was set up, may be dead 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

Missing murder suspect Ben 
Blauvclt is probably dead. 
according lo a friend of the for- 
mer IPFW student. 

But Fort 




Blauvclt was involved in the 
murder of visiting professor 
Maurice Lam. 

Blauvclt bludgeoned Lam to 
deaUi widi a barbell on Dec. 14. 
according to the confession of 
Kha Nguyen a fonner IPFW stu- 
dent who admitted lo helping 
wilh the murder, 

Ko Jin Soh. also a student here 
last fall, has been arrested like- 
wise as an accomplice in Lam's 
murder. 

According to Nguyen's confes- 
sion, the students murdered Lam 
and stole cash and Lam's 
checkbook. 

Lam's body, which was locat- 
ed last week, was dumped into 
the St, Joseph's River by the 
trio, according lo Nguyen, 

But a friend of Blauvell's con- 
siders Nguyen's version false. 
He believes the "mellow" 
Blauveli is being set up. The 
friend, who asked to remain 
anonymous, also said he thinks 
Nguyen killed Blauveli. 

"My personal belief is that this 
is the perfect set up for Kha 
Nguyen." the friend said, "He 
killed Ben knowing that when 
he gets caught he'll be able to 
blame it all on Ben and get off 
as an accessory." 

The friend said he's known die 
suspect for about a year. He said 
they were fairly close. 

"Ben was nice all of the lime. 
He didn'i seem to have a mean 
streak or anything," the friend 



Newly elected leaders eager, 
now looking toward future 



By Mike Wade 
News Editor 

Three international students 
and one member of Disabled 
Students Excelling in 
Leadership will fiU offices in the 
executive branch of IPSGA on 
March 18. 

Rajat Suii. a junior from India 
majoring in computer science, is 
the first international student 
elected president of the siudeni 
body. Suri previously served on 
Student Activities Board. 

"1 feel pretty good about being 
elected, but I think the job is a 
big responsibility." said Suri. 

"It would have been better if 
somebody had run against me. 
but I'm not taking the Job for 
granted just because I ran unop- 
posed, I take Ihc responsibility 
very seriously," continued Suri. 

Michael Will, a DASEL mem- 
ber majoring in secondary edu- 
cation, was elected vice presi- 
dent of legislation. Will has 



served on studcni senate in the 
past. 

"I think 1 can do a lot of good. 
Wc want to gel a good, strong 
senate together to work for Uie 
students," said Will. 

"I'm not looking for a buddy- 
buddy organization. 1 want sen- 
ate run by the rules — that way 
we can get things done," said 
WiU, 

Will also ran unopposed. He 
hopes that senate will address 
the needs of disabled students on 
campus. 

Secmab Rasheed, a junior from 
Bangladesh majoring in political 
science and business, will lake 
over Ihe office of vice president 
for finance, Rasheed previously 
served on student senaic. 

Rasheed said that he thought 
his dedication to his campaign 
helped to secure his elccdon, 

"I was surprised. I never 
expected to win. 1 guess the 
campaign paid off." he said. 



Rasheed said that diere was a 
misconception about the office 
he is to fill. 

"This is the office of policy 
im pie mentation, not pohcy mak- 
ing. I will follow through on 
whatever ISPGA intends to do. 
I'll provide my service lo fulfill 
whatever die students decide or 
require," he said, 

Kamran Rao, a Junior from 
Pakistan majoring in engineer- 
ing, will be vice president for 
student aciiviues, Rao previous- 
ly served as a board member on 
SAB. 

Rao was unavailable for 
com mem. 

"It is nice to sec inlernaiional 
students and disabled students 
excelling in the leadership of the 
students, They will be a great 
addition to students govern- 
ment." said Krisiina Fra/icr- 
Hcnry, current siudeni body 
prcsidenL 



said. "He just studied and spent 
a lot of time with Uic girl he was 
dating." 

"She's really worried," he said 
of the girlfriend. "She confided 
in me on a lot of ihings and she 
has no idea where Ben is at all."

Fort Wayne Police Sgi. Jim

Blauveli is still hiding some- 
where. Zamora said he has heard 
rumors that Blauvclt is dead but 
nothing official on that theory. 

Zamora said police are unsure 
where Blauveli may be hiding. 

Zamora said police welcome 
any input from students. He said 
dctecdvcs are getting no closer 
to finding Blauvclt. 

Blauvell's friend said he just 
wants the mystery to be

"I don't know if I'd rather have 
him dead and not involved or 
have him gel caught and admit 
to the murder," he said.

Advisory staff lacks 
concern for students 



Academic advising requires some special 
skills that it appears our advisors are bcking. 

IPFW could make good use of a few addi- 
tional advisors. Many of the advisors do not 
have ihe lime lo adetjuaicly advise ihc siu- 
denls. 

If Iherc were more advisors, each one would 
have a smaller case load and would be able to 
get 10 know ihe students belter. 

Advisors need to know the strengths and 
weaknesses of the students, Wilh this knowl- 
edge, advisors could more adeptly aid the stu- 
dents in choosing classes. 

The advisors should be telling students what 
subjects ihcy excel in and what subjects ihey 
need to dedicate more time to. 

With thai infomialion advisors could sched- 
ule classes lo maximize the student's chances 
of doing well. 

Help! Advisor wanted 



However, here at IPFW Ihe biggest deter- 
miner of classes seems to be whai classes are 
still open. 

Advisors need to know what classes will be 
difficult for students— not what classes will 
fit into the opening of M.WJ' 1:30 lo 2:20 
p.m. 

It is lime for our academic counselors to 
counsel students instead of signing cards and 
telling communication majors that Chemistry 
1 16 would fit nicely into their schedules. 

We are college students. Wc can read the 
Schedule of Classes for ourselves. 

The students need advisors lo do whai ihey 
can'i do for themselves — research classes, 
keep Irack of classes iliat will require a lot of 
time, help identify strengths and weaknesses, 
and remind ihem that they still need lo take 
Communication 114. 



By Mike Wade 
News EdKor 

IPFW recently sent mc a letter asking me to 
review the performance of my academic 
advisor. 

1 viewed advisers as people who signed my 
card and kept me firom taking loo many credit 
hours in a semester. However, il occuncd to 
me that there should be more lo advising than 
signing cards. 

IPFW's advisors are failing to advise. They 
are failing to give students the help we need 
to do well in our cbsscs. They arc failing to 
do their job. 

It is time to speak up and give some advice 
to our esteemed advisors. Here is my advice. 

First of all, advisers need lo know why a 
siudent wants to enroll in a particular course. 

I enrolled as a math major. I wanted to take 
a refresher class before jumping into calcu- 
lus. The 1990-9] Bulletin listed MA 153 as 
the prerequisite for introductory calculus, so I 
told my advisor I wanted to ctiroU in 153. 

He enrolled me without a word, even 
though I was listed as a maih major. 

The class was so boring to mc thai I quit 
going, except to take my exams, 1 came out 
of the class widi a C, the lowest grade I've 
gotten in any class. 

The next semester I tried to enroll in calcu- 
lus. Then my advisor perked up and told me 
thai I could not enroll because I still needed 
to lake MA 154, 

There was a mistake in the Bullciin. 

I couldn't get into 154 lasi semester 
because ihe classes were already full, so I'm 
in 154 this semester and doing terribly. I 
never go lo class and I'm probably looking al 
my second C. 

So the end result is thai I'm a sophomore 
and still haven't taken the Hrsi math class 
required for my major. I've essentially added 
a year to my college career. 

So back to my advice — ask the student why 
he or she wants lo enroll in a class. 

Secondly, do not advise a student to enroll 
in two lab classes in the same semester, espe- 
cially when the labs arc on the same day. 

I have another siory for this piece of advise, 



but I'll Sparc you the details and get lo the 
point- I was scheduled to be in class for 
seven hours in a row. Needless to say, some- 
thing had to give. 

I had to withdraw from a class, making mc 
lose full-lime status. The loss of full-time sta- 
tus caused my health insurance to skyrocket. 

To repeal my advice, do not schedule a stu- 
dent for two lab classes. 

Thirdly, do not schedule a student to be in 
class for more than three hours in a row. 
People get hungry and bred, they will end up 
skipping one of the classes. 

Additionally, do not schedule breaks 
between classes that arc long enough for the 
siudent to go home and come back. The stu- 
dent will not come back. 

Do not schedule night owls for morning 
classes, and do not schedule larks for evening 
classes. They will not go. 

Alternate science and liberal arts classes 
wiihin ihc semester. There is nothing more 
agonizing than taking an entire semester of 
math and science classes. 

Academic advisors need to know about 
course offerings, course requirements, and the 
lifestyles of the students they advise. 

I realize that I'm asking a lot of the ad- 
visors, but then again, it is their job. 

I also realize that I'm generalizing about the 
academic advisors here at IPFW as well as 
the studcnis. Perhaps there is a well qualified, 
helpful advisor on campus. If there is please 
direct me to his office, for I haven't been 
able to find him. 

As a point of clarification for any adminis- 
trator who would say I haven't held up my 
end of the relationship with my advisor, I 
plan four different class schedules before I go 
lo my advisor's office to register. 

With the abundance of closed classes not 
listed on the closed class list, my prc-madc 
schedules still lack feasibility. 

It needs to be noted that poor advisors not 
only cease to help studenLs. diey actually hun 
ihem. 

So get rid of those marginal advisors IPFW. 
and start listening to the students.

hard about how to put these degrees to use for 
the good of our country and not just for our- 
selves. 

A sappy, altruistic goal? No. The fact is. tlie 
price we're paying now for ihe personal 
excesses of the '80s proves that looking out 
for Number One doesn't create self-reliance; 
it only encourages costly self-indulgence. 
And prior to the '80s. self-indulgence was 
wisely seen as a trait lo be discouraged 
because it usually involved providing plea- 
sure to one at a cost to others, 

The bottom line is: Thinking about the good 
of others and of die future is not impossibly 
goody-goody, it's just good sen.se. And most 
of us, even the ones who don't have children 
lo leave inhcrilanccs to, do care about what 
happens to others — even though it's often 
inconvenient to do so. 

What wc need lo do, as wc achieve our goals 
and receive our degrees, is dedicate little 
places in our hearts and minds to remember- 
ing the mistakes of the '80s. And to those of 
you who like lo decorate your car wilh graffi- 
ti, find a place for a new bumper slicker:

There's no justice for 'B' permit parkers 



To the Editor: 

I don't have a lot of time lo 
write fancy, politically cor- 
rect letters, but I want to 
make a point to you. 

This is Ihc second time this 
semesler I have been fined 
for using a C space for a B- 
registered vehicle. This, I 
believe, is unreservedly 
unfair and should be discon- 
tinued. 

I have 10 come from work 
to take my daytime classes 
every day of the week. 



Therefore, I cannot come 
early to get a legal parking 
spot and could be to class late 
on a regular basis searching 
for one in die time I do have. 
Yet, 1 who pay and appreciate 
my parking privilege, am 
penalized for using one of 
scveriU open spaces for peo- 
ple not required lo pay one 
penny when all the B spaces 
arc taken. 

Working 50 hours a week, 
taking 12 hours of class — 
maintaining dean's list grades 



for the pasi 3 years has not 
been easy — I have really 
appreciated IPFW being there 
for me. However, Ihis policy 
of giving much needed park- 
ing space^along the river- 
cdgc— lo people at no charge 
while paying students are 
penalized for space thai 
should be available to ihem is 
ludicrous. Let these people 
pay to park giving all of us 
equal access to ihose 
spaces — or let B payers use 
those spaces and C people 



loo, if they are available. 
Student fees pay for these C 
users' jobs. The conve- 
nience — if dial term is even 
appropriate for IPFW stu- 
dents in situations like 
mine — should lean toward 
the paying student nol 
employees' complaints. 
Reconsider!

IPFW student 



Pro-lifers should guard kids, not morals 



To the Editor: 

While driving down 
Bluffton Road during ihe 
month of December, I came 
upon a sight that physically 
sickened me. On a grassy lot 
someone had placed 4,000 
little while crosses, with the 
intent lo honor, in mcmoriam, 
the 4,000 "babies" lost to 
abortions each day. As a 
woman, and as an American, 
I was disgusted; but I also 
remembered my Constitution, 
and ihe Bill of Rights, which 
allows the right to free 
speech. 

These anti-abortionists kill 
me wiUi ihcir high almighty 
atlitudcs, preaching the 
words of an alleged God, and 
selectively reading from their 
science fiction novel they call 
a Bible. I wish these people 
would gel off their sclf-scrv- 



ing, single-minded high 
horse, and take a look around ' 
ihcm. Have they taken the 
time to consider why women 
arc choosing to have abor- 
tions? Have Ihey seen the 
over-populalion, the poverty, 
die abuse ihat many unfonu- 
naie children live in today? 
Do they care that thousands 
of unwanted, diseased, hun- 
gry children litter our 
nation's streets and children's 
homes because their mother 
could not take care of them, 
or perhaps, just didn't want 
Uie child in the first place, but 
couldn't do anything about 
it? 

In 1973, after a difficult 
struggle, women were grant- 
ed anoUier of their few righLs. 
As a woman, I have choices. 
My body is mine alone to 
govern. My body docs not 



belong to a greed-ridden, 
vote-seeking politician who 
warns 10 lake my rights away. 

I know about the days of 
back-alley abortions. I fell 
the anguish of my fellow 
American sisters who died as 
a result of hemorrhages and 
infeciions from unsanitary 
tools; because ihey did some- 
tiiing so horrible as choosing 
not lo bring an unwanted 
child inlo the world. Their 
hves were lost because ihcy 
felt they had no other solu- 
tions, no otiier choices. 

Today, in this so-called Age 
of Progression, people are 
trying to turn back the clock. 
Then: is talk dial my right to 
choose will be taken away 
because it is immoral to kill a 
fcius. Who is to judge what is 
immoral? People who believe 
in an unseen entity, politi- 



cians who are promised votes 
if dicy do what Ihey are told? 
As I see it, politicians are 
puppets, their strings pulled 
by those in control, while the 
little people suffer for others' 
selfishness. 

Just a word to anti-abortion- 
isis ,.. It is your 
Constitutional right to 
express your opinions, but 
why don't you focus some 
attention on helping those 
children who are unwanted, 
who have no housing, food, 
or love? Try helping the chil- 
dren who are already here ... 
they need it more. One can 
accomplish a lot more good 
volunteering in a children's 
home than sitting in a jail.

Keith explores intestinal world of phone sex 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chitir 

Hello, and welcome lo Phone 
Friends. I'm your fiber optic pal. Jim, 

What would you like lo lalk about 
tonight? Well you can forget about il, 
buddy. This is not that kind of line. 

For explicit conversations read the 
next Angle section, beginning with Ihc 
two boldface words. 

PHONE SEX - Last month some- 
time I was watching lelcviston when 
the Maury Jesse-Winfrey program 
came on. 

"Pany line losers and the transsexual 
stripper twins who love ihcm," was 
ihctiiJcof theshow. 

I just had to watch. 

As the program unfolded, I became 
more and more astonished with how 
phone sex and party-line callers sail 
away their lives talking with people 
they can't sec. 

I was even more amazed when they 
began talking about their six-figure 
phone bills. 

"Does it bother you that you work 40 
hours each week at Arby's just to sink 
your entire paycheck into phone-sex 
bills?" Sally asked one guy. 

"No," he answered. 

It was then that I realized I was salt- 
ing away my life watching this dumb 
show. And boy was it dumb. 

Wail! I thought then. This was a 
dumb, really dumb topic — perfect 
Obtruse Angle fare. 

So, for the last month I've been 



working deep undercover, exploring 
the dank and dark intestinal world of 
phone sex. 

My undercover name was Keith. 

In case you are wondering how I 
could afford to call these lines, I put 
the phone bill on my Obinise Angle 
expense account. 

Phone sex laws 

Federal regulations govern what goes 
on with 900 numbers and other phone 
sex services. 

Ceruin regulations prohibit explicit 
conversations on lines that could be 
accessed by children. 

All phone sex lines and chat lines are 
limited to people over 18. And the 
people who operate the lines are 
expected to make sure callers are of 
age. 

I am guessing about all of that stuff. 

But they do uy to make sure you are 
18 when you call. Sort of. 

I called the line 1-900-IAM-FOXY 
to sec how careful they were about 
federal guidelines. 

Without asking mc how old I was, 
ihe girl who answered the line said, 
"This is just a chat line. For explicit 
conversations call . . ." And she gave 
me another number, which I called. 

This person named Gina answered. 
"What do you want lo lalk about 
Keith?" she asked. 

"How about the presidential race," 1 
said. "Jerry Brown's tax plan is 
wacky, huh?" 

She was silent. 



"Let mc come clean with you Gina," 
1 said. "I'm not calling to talk about 
your breasts or anything. I'm a federal 
agent and you are under arrest for not 
asking mc how old 1 am." 

Then the phone wcnl dead.

Wacky write-in candidates 
more fun than real IPSGA 



By Jim Walker 
Bdilor in Chief 

Last week's student government 
election was about as exciting as lis- 
tening to a trigonometry lecture. 

Il would seem that nothing entertain- 
ing or humorous could come from an 
event as dull as these election pro- 
ceedings. 

But how wrong you are. Here's a 
nutty list of names who appeared as 
write-ins on the IPSGA ballot: 

President: Mark Snyder, Goon. Ban 
Simpson. George Bush. Kristina 
Frazicr-Henry and Mickey Mouse. 

Vice President of Legislation: Jerry 
Brown. Jimi Hendrix, Mark Snyder, 
Lyndon Larouche, Nancy Barger, 
Chris Sheldon, and Donald Duck, 

Vice President of Student Activities: 
Dash Riprock. Tammy Faye Bakker 
and Goon. 

Vice President of Finance: Leona 
Hclmsley, Bullwinklc and Goofy, 

Senate: Goon, God, Sigmund Freud, 
Lassie, Flipper. Spanky, Alfalfa, Andy 
Warhol, Elvis Presley, Jim Morrison, 



Salvador Dali. Mike Hunt, Snoopy. 
Calvin and Hobbcs. 

Student Activities Board: Ren. 
Slimpy, Goon, Jeffrey Dahmer, Larry 
"Bud" Melman, Mikey from Life 
cereal, Moe, Larry, Curly, Gilligan, 
Homer Simpson, Joanne Lantz. Frank 
Borelli, Bozo ihe Clown, Krusty the 
Clown, Dr. Kevorkian, Charles 
Manson, Charles Keating, Nancy 
Reagan. Millie and John Doe, 

If the real elections were thrown out 
and the write-in votes were tallied, 
here's the student government we'd 
have in office next year. 

President - Goon 

Vice President of Legislation - 
Donald Duck 

Vice President of Student Activities - 
Tammy Faye Bakker 

Vice President of Finance - 
Bull winkle 

Hey, that would probably be the best 
govemmiyii this school has ever had. 

And their meetings would be a lot 
more fun.

"So Keith how old arc you?" 

"I'm 62 years young." 

"Whcn's your birthday?" 
I said, "Are you planning to buy mc

"No." she breathed. "I just need to

I lold her October 17, 1929. 

After a very long pause lo check the

See the phone sex people think they 
can screen out youngsters by pulling 
them on the spot with the birthday

Even if you are under 18. I'll bet you

All I had to do was give my calling 
card number and I was on the line 
with a bunch of people saying some 
really unsettling stuff. It was a tele- 
conference orgy. 

I finally got die guts to join in. I said, 
"Uh, Ihis is Keith, what's up dudes?" 

"Hi Kcilh." they all said, "Is this 
your first lime calling." 

"No, no. I'm a veteran." I lied, trying 
to mainiain their confidence. 

We talked for a little while about the 
specific sizes of our certain body 
pans. 

Then, some of the people started 
exchanging phone numbers. They 
a.'iked for mine. "Okay." I said grab- 
bing the phone book.

Piz7.a HuL 

Almost everybody hung up then 
except for Rose and myself. Rose had 
to slay on because she was in charge 
of running the line. Rose is paid to 
keep the line filled with nasty lalk. 

"Where are you at right now?" I 
asked. 

"I'm in bed baby, with nothing on al 
all," she answered. 

"No really." 

"I'm sitting in an office at a cramped 
meial desk," she said, 

"I bet you're wearing clothes loo, 
huh?" 

"You got it, Keith," 

Rose and I talked for a few minutes 
about last night's "Northern 
Exposure" episode and the NCAA 
tournament, she likes Duke. 

After chatting a while I asked. "How 
can you do this job. Rose?" 

"Beats workin'," she answered. 

Phone sex costs big bucks

A lot of the lines had a tricky 20

Just imagine how ungodly the phone

I talked with one guy named Tony

He said he didn't really think about

Errors serve IPFW 
loss to Gauchos 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Service errors by ihc IPFW men's 
volleyball team, including a key error 
in game four, helped the scvenih- 
rankcd U.C.-Sania Barbara Gauchos 
defeat the Vollcydons in ihc IPFW 
Spring Invimiional. 

The Gauchos surprised sixlh-rankcd 
IPFW early with wins of 15-10 and 
15-7 in Ihc first iwo games; but the 
Vollcydons were able to change the 
momcniiim and win game three, 15- 
10. 

Building on their new confidence, 
ihe Vollcydons took a commanding 
14-5 lead in game four. Junior Raul 
Papaico allcmpicd a jump serve on 
game point only to sec Ihc ball bounce 
harmlessly out of the net. The 
Gauchos then wcnl on a six-point 
scoring streak before the Vollcydons 
were able to get the final point of the 
gome and win 15-11. 

The Vollcydons were not able lo 5lop 
ihe Gauchos, who caught fire at the 
end of game four as they lost game 
five 15-7, 

'The key to the match was for us lo 
blow a 14-5 lead in game four on a 
service error," coach Ball said. "Wc 
allowed them to change the momen- 
tum and then couldn't handle the pres- 
sure in the fifth game." 



Junior hiucr Qucntin Spiegel sparked 
the Vollcydons' comeback with 15 
kills in the last three games of the 
match. "Luckily Qucnlin came off the 
bench, otherwise iJie match wouldn't 
have been this close." sophomore sel- 
ler Lloy Ball said. Ball led IPFW with 
66 assists and 17 digs. Norman 
Almodovar had 19 kills. Raul Papaico 
14. and Felipe Ralai added 12. 

On Friday IPFW beat U.C. -Irvine in 
dirce games by scores of 15-11. 15-10, 
and 15-7, despite accumulating 21 ser- 
vice errors, 

flic Vollcydons' other offense, kills, 
was good enough at 41 percent to 
negate the effect of their service 
errors. The IPFW defense limited 
lr\'inc to only a 16 percent attack aver- 
age. 

Freshman Craig Collins led the 
Vollcydons with 18 kills, Almodovar 
added 14, and Tom Juhnke had 13. 
Lloy Ball had 64 assists, seven digs, 
and four block assists. 

Strong performances from Lloy Ball, 
Tom Juhnke. and Queniin Spiegel 
earned ihcm spots on the all-loumey 
team. 

The Vollcydons remain undefeated 
in the MIVA conference, and move to 
21-7 overall. IPFW has two confer- 
ence matches left against Ohio State 
and Ball State.

Staff chooses NCAA favorites 



Joe Heersche Sports Editor: Duke: In 

the semi-finals against Indiana, Coach 
KryMwski of Duke will do anything lo 
win in an attempt lo retaliate at Coach 
Knight. Knight talked Coach K's par- 
ents into forcing him to attend West 
Point and play basketball for the 
Generals, thereby ruining any chance he 
had at having a normal collegiate life. 
Second, Coach Knight is insensitive lo 
African-Americans, not to mention 
sports joumalisis (remember "game 
face"). After beating Indiana, Duke will 
easily beat cither Michigan or Cincy in 
the final game. Duke could not possibly 
lose. With a player named Christian on 
their team, God has to be on their side. 
Plus, an added bonus is a player named 
Cherokee. This means Duke also has nil 
the Native American gods on their side. 
And finally, with players who will step 
on you to get to the lop, Duke won't

they've got a lot of bild headed guys.

They ore the Fab Five, and best of all 
there's a guy named Rose. So the sports

The Indiana Hoosicrs have a hammer- 
lock on the NCAA championship. 
Knight gave the boys a loslc o' the lash 
after Purdue, now nothing can stop 
ihcm. 

First to go into the blades will be Duke. 
They're ranked No. 1, but they'll be a 
nice hors.d'oeuvrc before Monday. 
Look for Calbert 'n' Damon to go lo the 
paint over Christian "Wonder Bread" 
Lacltncr, just like Ihey did against 
Shaquiltc, and get him in foul trouble. 
Jamal Meeks is twice as fast as Bobby 
"Ralboy" Hurley. Look for "Raiboy" to 
get tired quick. 

On Monday, they'll mess up 
Michigan's Frosh Five for the main 
course, then meet with President Bush 
for dcsscrl. Knight's fourth champi- 
onship. Count on it. Auto malic. 

Russ Beklaw, Staff Psychic: I threw 
laroi cards lo figure out who to Icl! my 
bookie lo bet on. I came up with 
Cincinnati. 

After uttering my magic incantation. 
"Who's gonna win a bundle for me in 
the loumamcnt?" I threw the queen of 
knives. Since the queen's a woman, and 
women like cats, the Cincinnati BearcaLs 
are gonna win. I know it's stupid, but I 
never asked for your lame-ass opinion 
anyway. 

I also found out next year's champion, 
who is... send me a S50 bill and a SASE 
to find out, chump.

If youth and inexperience were an 
asset, the '92 IPFW baseball team 
would be odds-on favorite to win the 
Great Lakes Valley title. But the 
painful tnilh for coach Carl Wilcoxson 
is that with youth comes mistakes and 
losses. With 11 freshmen on his 16- 
man roster Wilcoxson is still searching 
for answers. 

Juniors Ricardo Canalas and Eric 
Erdman are the only returnees from 
last year's 5-17 team. Canalas caught 
in 23 games for the 'Dons and Erdman 
appeared in 20 as an outfielder. 

Pitching is thin, but righthanders 
Chad Kcizler and Joe Smith are 
expected to get most of the work. "I 
would suspect that they arc our two 
pitchers that will carry the load." said 
Wilcoxson. "I'm still looking for 
someone out of the bullpen. So far no 
one has consistently proved they can 
be die stopper."

While pitching is still a question 
mark, Wilcoxson likes what he sees 
from his offense. "All of them so far 
look like they are pretty fair hitters. 
Ketzler would probably be the 
strongest hitler we have as far as dis- 
tance and Ron Dial and Jcrrod Chancy 
bodi have pretty good speed," 

During their spring break trip to 
Florida the 'Dons were 3-6 against 
teams with talent similar to that they 
face in league play. CPFW has yet to 
play a home game as the weather 
forced last weekend's game against 
Glen Oaks and GLVC foes Kentucky 
Stale and Bellarminc to be canceled. 

The 'Dons' record now sLinds at 3- 
10. 0-4 in the GLVC.
