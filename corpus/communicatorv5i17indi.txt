Committee begins 
screening applicants 
for super chancellor 



By MARK FRANKS 

The process of screening appli- 
cants for the job of super chancellor is 
under way as the Chancellor Search 
and Screen Committee has received 
over 80 applications to date. Nearly 
half of these candidates have gone 
through the initial screening step, 
according to one committee member. 

The committee has broken itself 
down to four sub-committees, each 
having two faculty members and one 
student. The applications are divided 
evenly among the four sub-commit- 
tees for consideration. It takes a 
unanimous vote of the sub-committee 
to eliminate any candidate from 
further consideration. 

"You have to go into these 
resumes with an open mind," said 
Charles F. Pratt, a student member 
of the committee. Pratt added that no 
candidate was being disqualified on 
the basis of sex, race or previous 
university affiliation. 

Pratt's comments suggest that 
the committee is not abiding by the 
demands of certain faculty organiza- 
tions on campus which would exclude 
from consideration all candidates 
with affiliation to either I.U. or 
Purdue. 

The Indiana Faculty Senate, the 
American Federation of Teachers, 
and the Association of University 
Professors have adopted resolutions 
to exclude affiliated candidates. The 
Purdue Faculty Senate has tabled 
such a resolution.

Hutker analyzes his new job as 
Interim Business Manager for Pur- 
due here. 

Hutker was appointed to the new 
post on January 4, 1974 by James E. 
Thatcher, director of regional cam- 
pus business affairs for Purdue. 

Hutker will replace Thomas K. 
Scott, who accepted the position of 
Vice-President for Business Affairs of 
Bryant College in Smithfield, Rhode 
Island.

from an affiliated candidate with ties 
to this campus. The application is 
being processed along with the others. 
At an open hearing conducted by 
the committee on December 19, 1973, 
numerous faculty representatives 
requested that the final list of 
candidates selected by the committee 
be presented to the faculty for 
approval. 



According to one committee 
member, the committee has made no 
definite decision on the request. 

Committee members have voiced 
concern over subjecting these final 
candidates to a faculty popularity 
contest. "We're going to run into 
problems if we have candidates come 
out here and faculty and students 
have a popularity contest," said one

' chancellor would be 
responsible for putting together the 
new budget," said Hutker, "but we 
can't wait." The Super-chancellor is 
not expected to be on campus until 
July 1, the same date that the new 
budget must go into effect. 

The budget will consist of all 



appropriations made to either I.U. or 
Purdue for the Fort Wayne Campus 
plus any additional appropriations 
that may be granted by this 
legislative session. 

Hutker will also begin the 
unification of the two local business 
offices. He will need to integrate the 
I.U. functions into the- Purdue 
operation. These 



s such as safety and security and 
buildings and grounds are already 
unified under Purdue.

position he was responsible for the 
bursar's and student finance offices 
and for the cash-flow areas of the 
Student Union, such as the Sweet 
Shoppe. Hutker will retain some of 
these responsibilities and others will 
be assigned to Purchasing Manager 
Donald R. Katter. 

Hutker received both the bache- 
lor's and master's degrees in business 
administration from IU-PU. He also 
has an associate degree from 
International Business College.

will have to satisfy the two parent 
campuses. 

Hutker was confident that the 
new system would be developed with 
"almost 100 percent input" from the 
local level. This system would have to 
be what is best for a majority of 
people, Hutker said. 

Hutker said that many of the 
accounting and money handling 
procedures will remain the same. 
Lafayette will continue to invest 
IU-PU fee money and will disperse 
money for this campus. But he 
emphasized that it wOl be Fort Wayne

The American Federation of 
Teachers (AFT) at Indiana-Purdue 
feels that the faculty should have a 
more direct voice in the selection of 
the super chancellor, according to 
Sheldon F. Gottlieb, president. 

"We have suggested to the Search 
and Screen Committee that the 
faculty interview the candidates 
selected by the committee. 

"The AFT has gone on record to 
say that after the committee selects 
the five or ten names to be presented 
to the presidents, the faculty should 
be allowed to interview and vote for or 
against these selections," Gottlieb 
announced. 

Gottlieb feels that the super- 
chancellor should be selected only 
from the list of named approved by 
the faculty. 



students, eight faculty members, two 
community members and two repre- 
sentatives of the universities' presi- 
dents. This committee will receive 
applications for the new post of super- 
chancellor of Indiana-Purdue and 
then will report these selections to the 
presidents and boards of trustees of 
both universities. 

Gottlieb is concerned about the 
fact that the presidents are able to 
choose someone for the new post who 
has not been selected by the Search 
and Screen Committee. 

The AFT head said, "We take 
issue with this for two reasons: One, 
this will create faculty distrust in the 
administration; Two, this lends 
justification to faculty fear that there 
has already been a super-chancellor 
selected by the presidents." 

Gottlieb outlined the qualifica- 
tions the AFT feels are important for 
the new super -chancellor. "We want 



the academic ranks. We want 
someone who has done both teaching 
and research. This person needs a 
broad perspective in education." 

He added, "A lot depends on the 
individual and his attitudes toward 
education, academic freedom, ten- 
ure, loads and innovation. 

The AFT feels that the super- 
chancellor will help chart the future 
growth of Indiana-Purdue. 

Regarding the future action of the 
AFT, Gottlieb said, "A lot is going to 
depend on how much information the 
Search and Screen Committee pro- 
vides the faculty. We will constantly 
press the committee for information, 
both formally and informally."

those applying for the job, the AFT

Language misuse corrupts thought 



MS marathon 



As the controversial search for a qualified super-chancellor 
continues, Circle K, a "super" organization on campus, has been 
meticulously working on their annual Multiple Sclerosis campaign. 

Circle K, with additional help from the Students' Government and 
other varius service organizations, is planning a twenty-four hour MS 
Marathon February 1-2, a day that hopefully will prove to be jampacked 
with numerous activities and events. An auction, press conference, 
eating contests, and even a hairy legs contest are being formulated as a 
few of the attractions thus far. 

The major thrust of the MS campaign will be generated from our 
campus, and will spread as far north as Angola and south as Decatur. The 
primary concentration, however, will take place here on campus, and 
then, to a lesser degree, the city and outlying communities. 

As usual. Circle K has put the maximum amount of effort into this 
campaign in order to fight the slow, progressive crippling of MS. It is 
interesting that their efforts go unaided by student activity money. Circle 
K has not reaped any of the monetary benefits from the student activity 
fund, but they continue to show their dedication, good will, and service 
throughout the community. Perhaps, Circle K is setting an example for 
other organizations on campus that receive substantial amounts of 
money every year from the student activity fund, but neglect to benefit a 
substantial amount of students. 

The success of Circle K's campaign to fight MS appears to lie solely 
upon the energies of the student body, faculty, and administration. It is a 
chance for all of us to help someone by giving, and, perhaps, for ourselves 
to benefit as well. If you wish to donate more than just money, students 
may contact people in the Circle K coatroom or in the Students' 
Government office. If you have the heart, support the fight against MS, 
and aid a "super" organization in a great cause. 



'Affiliated' candidates 



Last semester, the Communicator opposed the concept of a Lafayette 
affiliated IU-PU business manager. It was our concern that the 
appointment of a "Purdue" business manager would possibly negate the 
independence IU-PU achieved through a single budget and subordinate 
business manager. 

We have taken a long, hard look nl our previous position, and feel that 
it is time to rescind it. We seemed to be placing a man on trial with the 
philosophy that he was guilty until proven innocent. His charge was one of 
being prejudiced in his judgment towards the business affairs of this 
campus. 

Ironically, we were the ones being put on trial, and for the same 
charge, that of being prejudiced. The verdict became quite clear to us, 
and thus, a change in policy resulted. 

It is poor judgment to nullify a person's chances for a job on this 
campus according to what school he or she may have ties with. 

There has been a lot said concerning just that. A great many persons 
feel that the super-chancellor should have no previous ties with either 
I U. or Purdue This would, supposedly, prevent prejudice on the part of 
the super-chancellor. This "system" of selection appears to negate the 
qualifications of anyone as long as they are affiliated with l.U. or Purdue. 
This "game" does nothing more than show hindsight on the part of those 
supporting it. Indeed, they are the ones showing prejudice. 

This campus is going through a rebirth, and it seems like everyone is 
feeling the labor pains. The faculty is not calm to say the least. 
Administrators are applying for jobs at other universities. The only 
people that seem to feel secure around here are the cooks in the cafeteria. 
We are in the stages of transcending an era of dualism, and it is our hope 
that we do it on the right note. 

The method of selection of a super-chancellor will be a strong 
determinant on whether or not that note fits in with the music.

and fairest allocator of fuel. 

"We're living in a world in which 
groups with political power will assert 
themselves, "Wilhelm said, "and rat-

As an example, he pointed out 
that already two important power

"Rationing at the wholesale level

"We're beginning to hear from 
the AFL-CIO. which wants to make 
sure industry will not get cut out so 
unemployment won't grow. Every- 
body is getting in their licks," he said 
in an interview. 

Under rationing, a black market, 
"a boon to organized crime," would 
develop, along with "a system 
encouraging everybody to lie and 
cheat to justify their need for fuel." 

He foresees "a flow of coupons 
from the northern and southern parts 
of the country toward the center of the 
nation. Those living near the 
Canadian and Mexican border will be 
able to get gas by driving over the 



through the use of higher prices." 
The price system would ration the gas 

to those who were willing to pay the 

higher price. 

' 'This would cut out the need for a 
bureaucracy which would get deeply 
involved in the lives of people," he 
said. He estimates that rationing 
would require a force of 10,000 
bureaucrats costing in excess of $100 

Noting that counterfeit coupons 
approached 15 per cent of the total

Prof resigns through letter 



An open letter to "Self-Quest," 
Monday and Wednesday at 430p: 

Some of you know, but others of 
you may be interested to learn that I 
turned in A's for all members of our 
class. If there had been a place for it 
on the roster, I would have recom- 
mended an A for me also. The class 

r words, and the proper share of 



preferred blanket A's to blanket C's 
for two reasons : ( 1 ) three hours of A 
(as a non-grade) are more useful to 
all of you than three hours of C, and 
(2) blanket A's are more subversive 
of the grading system-which contin- 
ually frustrates me, but which I have 
lacked the courage before to ignore. 
"...the kids in her class got those 
(A's) precisely because she had just 
taken her pen and written the letter 
(A)..." (Herndon, p. 99) 28 times on 
the roster. 

I feel that submitting my resigna- 
tion to you is more appropriate than 
submitting it to the University, 
because you were there as I 
unraveled the unsuitability of my 
presence here. "Teaching" is the 
complete expression of me: it 
exhausts my every impulse, ability, 
power, insight, and emotion. Most 
important, however, my experience 
with "teaching" destroys any notion I 
have had of standards, educational 
objectives, and curricula. 

-Standards Work (i.e., reading, 
discussing, thinking, and writing, in 
the case of English Composition 
W131) can be evaluated best by the 
worker (meaning you) on the basis of 
the following criteria; Did the work 
completed express her -him? Did 
he-she like the finished product and 
enjoy the process? Is writing now a 
more viable form of self-expression? 

-Educational Objectives I saw 
each of you as a being made already 
perfect by all that you are, know, and 
experience My relevance is to your 
endless processes of thinking and 
learning, which are integral to your 
perfection. Rage, rage against the 
coming of the jchools, advises Ned 
O'Gorman. You have raged. For all 
your years in English classes, getting 
a subject and verb to agree happens 
most often and most easily only when 
subject-verb agreement is the most 
nearly accurate expression of what 
you passionately want to say. Shall I 
insist than that your subjects and 
verbs always agree? No, not I. 

-Curricula I have "taught 
curricula thought up by people who've 
been dead for decades, curricula 
created a few years ago by people 
now still living, and this semester a 
curriculum which I myself helped to 
plan. Of those, I like the third the best. 

I know, am aware of, and 
understand many intricacies of the 
English language. The grammatical 
structure of English is obvious to me; 
1 can visualize it, I imagine it with 
ease. I am trying to say that I am not 
without knowledge which is market- 
able within the University But I intuit 
a need in you for learning not what I 
know, but for learning how to learn 
what you need to know. My response 
to that need was personal, and the 
curriculum in "Self-Quest" was Dee. 
That would be justifiable if I had been 
able to persuade each of you to be 
your own curriculum, too. 

You are the prize— don't take your 
eyes off It.

Says Communicator 
intimidates creativity 

To The Editor, 

The review of "Impressions 
Magazine " in the November 8 issue of 
the Communicator was extremely 

First of all, it was not a review, it 
was a criticism.lt was one student 
taking upon herself the responsibility 
of condemning many hours of hard 
work that some of her fellow students 
put into a worthwhile project. 

I reject Ms. Franke's statement 
that "the editor are clearly at fault for 
the disgraceful appearance of this 
magazine." Check out the budget 
allotted to "Impressions" and then 
you, Ms. Franke, see how many 
"textured color pages" you could 

One of the biggest problems 
facing this campus is student apathy . 
At the least 'Impressions" shows us 
that there are some people on this 
campus working on a project, 
together, not only for their own 
benefit but to let the rest of us know 
that there's more going on at this 
campus than just classes. 

This is an undergraduate magaz- 
ine and the purpose of this university 
is not to intimidate individual 
creativity but to encourage it. If I 
had contributed to this issue of 
"Impressions" and then taken this 
review seriously, I would definitely 
hesitate to ever attempt publishing 
any writing or art work in the future, 
and especially in any publication of 



this i 



sii&gt; 



Possibly my taste is not as highly 
cultivated as Ms. Franke's but I 
enjoyed Mr. LaBov's 'When There's a 
Will There's a Way" and Ms. Yaney's 
leaf poem, along with the efforts of 
the other contributors. It really takes 
courage to subject one's personal 
efforts to the scrutiny of one's peers 
and I think all of the writers 
represented should be commended 
for making their contributions to 
'Impressions Magazine."

MIDWEST SCORES IN BOWL TILTS 

With all those pretty ladies attending their Bowls, how 
could the midwest squads keep from scoring? 

Ara Parseghian finally won a big one, and a big one it 
was. Everybody outside of Notre Dame was picking the 
Crimson Tide by 14 and rightfully so. 

But the Irish earned their national title in conquering 
one of the best college squads ever. 

The Rose Bowl match was a crilical one for the Big Ten 
Conference. Big Ten entries had been mauled in previous 
years, and there was talk of leaving the Big Ten out of an 
assured berth in the classic unless its yearly entries 
improved their performances. 



Pasadena extravaganza in the first place. But when all the 
smoke had cleared, O.S.U. had claimed a very impressive 
42-2J success over Southern Cal's powerful Trojans. 

revenge for the Buckeyes and their coach 
, and a big score for the Big Ten and the 
midwest. 

The sports predictor for Newsweek better n " 



the Fighting Irish basketball powerhouse at South Bend. 
Like the Irish football squads, the cagers were almost 
always high in the national rankings. 

But Phelps inherited a cage squad that was almost 
completely devoid of talent. For most of the first season 
under Phelps, Notre Dame seldom came within 20 points of 
their opposition. 

Indiana walloped the Irish by over 50 points, making the 
defeat the worst in Notre Dame's history. Digger's boys 
would have had their hands full playing a local high school 

Yet through careful recruiting and good coaching, the 
Irish today are again one of the most powerful teams in the 
i. Through the first eight tilts this year, Notre Dame is 
undefeated and ranked second in the nation. 

But they won't be without defeat for long. Twice in the 
next few weeks the opposition will be the Walton boys from 
UCLA. 

j to fall to Notre Dame this year is 
were ranked second in the pre-season 

&gt;n started Bob Knight brought his 
cagers to the Coliseum in Fort Wayne for a practice 
"showcase" game. After that tilt, local fans and writers 
raved over the chances of this year's Hoosier entry. The 
word was out that nobody, but nobody, would be able to 
whup the boys from Bloomington. 

Well, after the Irish easily handled Indiana, the 
Hoosiers journeyed to Oregon to take on Oregon State. Yes, 
somewhere out there there's a squad called Oregon State, 
unranked and relatively unknown. But somehow the still 
highly-touted Hoosiers fell, 61-48, and were promptly 
1 from the national top ten. 

"People still were confident, though, that when the Big 
Ten campaign started the Hoosiers would rebound and 
conquer all. 

The first Big Ten foe for I.U. was Michigan January 5th. 
In the first half the Hurryin' Hoosiers buried the 
;, and it looked like they were on their way to a 
convincing triumph. 

But in the second half Indiana came out ice-cold and 
just could not get going. Michigan finally overtook the 
shattered Big Ten favorites and claimed a 2-point upset 

Now nobody knows what is going to become of the 
falling Hoosiers. Quinn Buckner is woefully out of shape, 
and who knows what happened to Indiana's Mr. Basketball 
from last year, Kent Benson He is only a freshman but had 
been stamped for plenty of action. 



DOESN'T ANYBODY LIKE CHARLIE O. F1NLEY? 

No. The latest person to offer his critique on the 
self-made sports millionaire from La Porte, Indiana (sorry 
to sayt, is Johnny Newmann, a rookie in the ABA and 
lormer college star from down south. Neumann was 
recently traded from the Finley-owned Memphis Tarns to 
the Utah Stars for three good players. 

Neumann, upon departing from his hometown, 
delivered a thorough verbal whupping to Charlie the Ass, as 
he is affectionally known throughout the sports world. 
Among other things printable, Neumann called his former 
boss a "totally useless" bungler. 

The debate on Finley's actions concerning his baseball 
manager Dick Williams rages on. I feel that after Finley 
unmistakably gave his blessing on national television after 
Oakland's World Series victory, he should have stuck to it 
and released a man who will no longer serve him anyway. 

If Charlie 0. ("0" reportedly stands for "ogre") ever 
decides to come to Fort Wayne for whatever reason, I for
