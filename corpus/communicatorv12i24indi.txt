Athletic Department moving up 



Athletes to get scholarships... 



ByMlKEFRANKE 
Chief Reporter 

Beginning next year, partial 
athletic scholarships will be 
awarded to IPFW athletes in (our 
sports This will be the first time 
athletic scholarships are to be of- 
fered campus a thletes in any sport. 

The scholarship money, allocated 
by the school's Red and Gold 
Booster Club, will total $2,000 next 
year. It is hoped that the scholarship 
fund will be increased from that 
initial amount. A total of 58,000 in the 
fund would make IPFW competitive 
with most area schools, according to 
David R Skelton, director of athletic 
programs 

Basketball and volleyball players, 
both men and women, will be the 
initial recipients of the scholarship 
money, Skelton said The money will 
be broken down by sport this way: 
men's basketball, $1,000; women's 



basketball, $600; and men's and 
women's volleyball, $300 each. 

That translates into a «M0 split of 
the money between men and women, 
with the men getting 60 percent. This 
is due, Skelton said, to comply with 
TiUe IX of the Education Amend- 
ments of 1972. Part of Title K deals 
with how scholarship money is to be 
divided between men's and women's 
sports. The money is to be divided 
according to the percentage of men 
and women participating in all 
sports on a percentage basis, 
Skelton said. "We're just following 
the rules," he said 

The booster club, which is 
providing the money, is comprised 
of businesses and Individuals In- 
terested in supporting the IPFW 
athletic program. 

The scholarship fund, along with 
the new athletic fund, should drum 



up more Interest in attending 
D?FW among high school seniors 
making decisions. 

One of the area's top women's 
basketball players, contacted by 
The Communicator, has shown some 
interest in attending IPFW next fall. 
Missy Van Ort, who led Garrett to 
the Fort Wayne Regional title and 
has been invited to tryout for the All- 
State team, said she still has IPFW 
on her shopping list, though she is 
also entertaining offers from out-of- 
state schools. 

"The school is a good one and the 
women's team made progress this 
past season," Van Ort said. "Having 
money available to athletes is also a 
positive factor." However, the lack 
of dorms on campus is a drawback, 
she added. "Driving in everyday 
from Garrett would become ex- 
pensive," she explained. 



Another top area player con- 
tacted, Tonya Burns of state-ranked 
Leo, also said a true campus at- 
mosphere would be more to her 
liking. Burns, also an All-State 
candidate, is still investigating 
several offers from out-of-state 
schools. 

The fact that only $2,000 will be 
available also becomes a stumbling 
block. Only a limited amount of 
money can be made available to any 
athlete. However, as the fund grows, 
more scholarship money can be 
offered and more sports will be 
added to the list of scholarship 
sports. 

With a new athletic facility, along 
with the scholarship money, IPFW 
will become a more attractive 
alternative to area athletes. The 
scholarship fund, though limited, is 
a start at turning the university's 
athletic program around. 



...teams to enter Division II 



ByJENSM.SORENSEN 
Start Writer 

If all goes according to plans, 
IPFW will be competing as an NCAA 
Division II school by the 1982-83 
season, according to recom- 
mendation by the Joint Athletic 
Advisory Council. 

The move is seen as part of an 
overall upgrading of campus 
athletics, which includes the new 
athletic complex, limited athletic 
scholarships and a booster club. 

The advisory committee, com- 
prised of six faculty members, four 
students and the director of athletic 
programs, has recommended that 
IPFW apply for Division II mem- 
bership, beginning in the 1982-83 
school year, according to David 
Skelton, athletic programs director. 

Men's sports now (all under the 
umbrella of Division HI of the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association, while women's sports 
are governed by the Association for 
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women 
I AIAW) . Prior to 1975, IPFW had no 
national affiliation. 

There is a certain "prestige 
factor" involved with being Division 



II, Skelton said, which would 
broaden the exposure of the campus 
as a whole, as well as the athletic 
department The move may also 
provide an edge in recruiting quality 
athletes, he said. 

The NCAA has recently expanded 
to include women's sports and the 
committee proposal calls for 
switching the affiliation for women's 
sports from the AIAW to the NCAA. 
That would permit all campus sports 
to operate under one national 
governing body, a long-time ad- 
visory committee objective. 

Certain criteria must be met over 
a two-year period to be granted 
membership In NCAA Division II, 
Skelton said, which Is the reason 
19B2-83 is the first year rPFW would 
be eligible to compete In that 
division. However, Division III 
guidelines, under which IPFW will 
still operate next year, forbid the 
granting of athletic scholarships. 
This means a certain amount of 
affiliation juggling will be required 
next year, since EPFW will begin 
offering limited athletic scholar- 
ships. 



Men's sports will remain in 
Division III next year, with women's 
sports also joining the NCAA 
Division III. However, scholarship 
sports 1 basketball and volleyball for 
both men and women) will not be 
competing in that division. Women's 
scholarship sports will remain in the 
AIAW, which does allow limited 
scholarships, and men's basketball 
will compete in the National 
Association for Intercollegiate 
Athletics (NAIA), which also per- 
mits athletic scholarships, Skelton 
said. 

For men's volleyball, IPFW will 
request a Division I standing, since 
there are presently no divisional 
tournaments in that sport, only a 
single NCAA championship for all 
member schools. The volleyball 
team already plays a large portion 
of its schedule against Division I 
teams. 

Then in 1982-83, assuming IPFW 
meels all the criteria for mem- 
bership, all sports — men's and s 
women's — will compete under the 
Division II banner, with the ex- 
ception of men's volleyball. The 



volleyball team will retain its 
Division I standing, at least until the 
NCAA begins offering divisional 
championships, Skelton said. 

Among other reasons for the 
move, Skelton said, is that D?FW has 
more in common with Division II 
schools, which includes many stale- 
supported institutions of similar 
size. Smaller, private schools make 
up the bulk of Division III and the 
NAIA. 

Skelton feels the move will expand 
the opportunities for the athletic 
programs. "All of our sports will 
reach out further in their geographic 
competition," he said, with 
schedules that include teams from 
Kentucky, Illinois and Wisconsin, as 
well as regional schools from 
Indiana, Ohio and Michigan, 

The switch from Division III to 
Division II as a single, unified 
national affiliation is seen as a 
positive step in changing the image 
of IPFW athletics from that of a 
second-rate extension campus to 
that of a solid sports program with 
its own identity — an image that will 
reflect on the campus as a whole. 



Scientists, fundamentalists battle 



By GLORIA HIZER 
Staff Writer 

The origin of the 
mystery of the cosmos and man's 
search for his beginnings are issues 
that have flared once again in a heated 
debate between scientists and fun- 
damentalists with the classroom as a 
battleground 

The Indiana House of Represen- 
tatives Education Committee voted 3-7 
against H.B. 1739 which would have 
allowed school boards to require 
"balanced treatment" of creation and 
evolution in public instruction. A 
similar bill, S.B. 419, has not yet been 
brought to a committee vote in the State 
Senate. 

The bills state in part that "the 
treatment of creation science and 
evolution science in public schools shall 
be limited to scientific findings and 
inferences for each model and may not 
include any religious instruction or 
references to religious writings or 
doctrine." 

Part of the difficulty of this issue is in 
defining what actually constitutes 
science. 

Most scientists agree that any theory 
must be tested with physical evidence 
and the results be interpreted as fact 
until new evidence Is 'discovered. 
"Science is a self-corrective process," 
said Paul Provost, professor of an- 
thropology at IPFW. "Science has to do 
with physical reality," he said. And, 
according to scientist and astronomer 
Carl Sagan, the age and origin of life 
forms In this universe has a tremen- 
dous "body of evidence, mutually 
consistent and beautifully persuasive." 

Creation, on the other hand, is a 
matter of fatth, according to many 
religious spokespersons who claim it 
should be dealt with only in a religious 
format, not in the public schools. 

"The Bible Is a book of religion. It 
does not leach science." said Father 
Richard Hire, director of religious 
education for the Fort Wayne-South 
Bend Diocese. Other religious leaders 
agree there is no contradiction between 
true religion and true science and that 
they are separate entities. Rabbi 
Richard Safran, of Achdulh Vesholom 
Congregation said, "EvoluLion is not 
the opposite of religion." 

But what about those who call 
themselves scientific creationists? 
They contend the Biblical version of 
creation has "as much, It not more, 
scientific data to back up the theory of 
creationism as there Is for 
evolutionism," said Indiana State 
Senator James Butcher. 

Organizations such as The Creation- 
Science Research Center (CSRC), The 



The age and origin of life forms in this 
universe has a tremendous "body of evidence, 
mutually consistent and beautifully persua- 
sive. " Carl Sagan, scientist and astronomer. 



Institute for Creation Research (ICR) 
and The Creation Research Society 
(CRS) focus on interpretations of 
scientific data to demonstrate that the 
universe is less than 10,000 years old, 
claiming that the great worldwide flood 
formed fossilsand geologic strata. 

Robert E. Kofehi, science coor- 
dinator for CSRC claims not to ad 
vocate teaching Bible stories or Bible 
verses in the public school science 
classrooms, but rather inject other 
scientific data which does not agree 
with the evolutionary data and use it as 
a critical evaluation for alternative 
explanations. William J, Tinkle, former 
secretary for CRS discounts Charles 
Darwin's "Descent of Man." "This Is 
an occurence which no one has ob- 
served and should not be called 
science," Tinkle said. 

Perhaps the group causing the most 
stir are the "fundamentalists," who are 
seeking to instill Biblical zeal Into the 
public school curriculum. 

This group is skeptical of all scientific 
evolutionary data and is distrustful of 
teaching these "theories," Reverend 
James Robinson, a Conservative 
Evangelical Christian told ABC News 
Nightline, "teaching of evolution is 
very definitely a theory, not a fact; 
when it is taught as a fact, I see it as an 
attack on Scripture, against God and 
the authority found in the Bible. 

Sagan stresses that "the evolution 
theory is not vague or casual. It is 
based upon an enormous body of 
supporting evidence all over the world, 
repeatedly consistent." He warns that 
accepting an authoritarian text and 
closing one's mind to the physical facts 
of science is "exceptionally dangerous 
if we are to survive the next decades." 

The propoponents of this bill have a 
variety of reasons for wanting It 
passed. Those who see both evolution 
and creation as equal scientific 
methods favor a "two model approach" 
to leaching. H. Norman Balllnger, 
director of Information at Fort Wayne 
Community Schools believes teachers 
can be trusted to present a balanced 
view of the subject. "In any area of 
controversy or two aided Issue, we 
encourage, expect and demand a good 
and logical presentation of the subject 
In Its proper framework," he said. 



In an Indianapolis television survey, 
42 percent of the responses favored 
teaching Biblical creation and 
evolution side by side in the science 
classroom, claiming that "the child 
needs to know both sides. " 

Other proponents insist that neither 
are scientific theories, but should be 
used as "frames of reference" without 
injecting religious teachings into the 
classroom, said Richard Bliss, director 
of ICR. 

Opponents to the bill see it as a 
blatant effort to reintroduce religious 
doctrine Into the public classroom. 
Safran has begun a letter writing 
campaign urging community people to 
oppose It for this reason. He claims that 
"Imposing on public schools this 
religious jacket will weaken public 
schools and weaken religion." The 
Indianapolis survey quoted 58 percent 
against the creation proposal, 
reasoning that it was not the school's 
place and that the churches should 
teach the Biblical theory. 

Other opponents are shaken by the 
fact that school curriculum would be 
dictated by the legislature. "I am op- 
posed to any legislation that would be a 
prescription for education and learn- 
ing," said Richard Johnson, professor 
of modern foreign languages at IPFW. 
Provost agrees that "this is just not the 
American way. We have an open. 
system built on the integrity of 
cooperating minds, and this com- 
promise would be disastrous." Lew 
Wise of the campus education depart- 
ment notes there are "too many 
problems In the literal Interpretations 
of Scripture and they should not be 
forcibly placed in the school 
curriculum." 

Another concern of some opponents is 
that many other widely diverse 
theories exist and have validity. Sagan 
said, "There are hundreds of different 
religions on the planet earth with an 
equal number of theories on the origins 
of life." Among these are the belief that 
the earth Is fiat or that outer space does 
not really exist Both these ideas claim 
to have undisputed physical facts. 
Provost feels passage of this bill would 
require that all of these existing 
theories be taught, which would be 
ludicrous.

Black child topic of 
Petterson's lecture 

By VICKI SCOTT 
Staff Writer 

Self confidence is the key to raising a 
healthy well-balanced black child 
reported Pamela Petterson, Inner City 
Specialist for the Fort Wayne Mental 
Health Center. Petterson gave a lecture 
recently to a Social Psychology class 
during its study of black history. 

Petterson develops workshops for 
adults who care for black children. Her 
goal In the classroom lecture was to 
introduce the class members to the 
problems of the black child. 

Because of discrimination, black 
children are scarred emotionally, even 
as young as three years old, Petterson 
said. From early onward they develop a 
negative concept of their race, shesaid. 

She said the media continue the 
image of the black as dumb, awkward 
and oversexed. Petterson stressed that 
our culture is still very color conscious. 
She said that "the good guys wear 
white." 

The class was told that our 
educational system continues the 
prejudice and perpetuates the lack of 
self confidence the black child ex- 
periences It has kept a labeling system 
that stays with each child throughout 
his school career, she said, and school 
integration mentally affects children. 
"The black community feels as if they 
need to sit beside a white person to 
absorb intelligence," she said. 

"There Is a lime for assimilation and 
a lime for separation," Petterson suid 
in regard to black children in schools 
and activities, She said blacks should 
have a choice in the matter. 

In her final remarks, Petterson said 
it is everyone's responsibility In help 
the black child retain self esteem so he 
can grow up as happy and healthy as 
any other child. She said It is 
everyone's responsibility to prevent the 
emotional death of a black child.

'Vegas hits IPFW 



By JAMIE WISE 
Staff Writer 

High stakes and the gilt-edged 
dreams of Las Vegas came to IPFW 
Friday night. A small, but friendly 
crowd attended the SUBOG-sponsored 
"Casino Night" in Walb Memorial 
Union's Ballroom. Blackjack dealers 
and roulette spinners decked out in 
green eyeshades and armgarters of red 
and black silk dealt the unpredictable 
blows of Lady Luck to high-rolling 
students loaded down with $50 and Sioo 
bills — all play money. 

While the players weighed the odds 
and eyed the prizes lined up on stage, 
Mark Wells and Greg Clark kept the 
decks moving on the blackjack tables. 
The rules were laid down: "push on 20, 
plays on 21, Over 21 and You Bust! " 



Sue Short, Norma Knoop and Cathy 
Voors spun the wheels of fortune as 
gamesters cried "c-mon, hurry five, 
hurry" and "go for it, sucker! " 

After the casino was shut down, Greg 
Clark auctioned off the prizes. A 
calculator went for a cool $9,000. Chug- 
a-Lug, a drinking man's game, brought 
in $5,200 and Wilson tennis balls went 
for the comparatively low sum of 
$1,200. Rumor had it the big winner of 
the night pulled in 20,000 big ones. The 
way people were throwing paper money 
around you would have never known 
there was a recession going on,, 

Kathy Ertel, chairperson of SUBOG 
and main organizer for the event, 
brought it all into focus. "We don't 
make any money off of this. It's all in 
fun." 



In brief ... 

1,300 sign Senate's petition 

By JIM CHAPMAN 
Chief Reporter 

More than 1 ,300 students have signed their names to Student Senate petitions 
which will be sent to the State Legislature. The Senate is trying to limit the 12-18 
percent increase in tuition at IPFW as proposed by the State Budget Com- 
mittee. 

The Student Senate set up booths in the basement of Kettler Hall and the 
ground floor of the Walb Memorial Union last Thursday and Saturday. The 
Senate supplied all stamps and stationery andsentout all the names and letters 
to IheState Legislature in hopes of limiting the increase. 

According to Bob Griebel, student senator, the Senate had approximately 
1,100 signatures after the first day of the campaign. On Sunday evening, March 
IS, Tom Harris, legislative affairs committee chairperson, announced that 
more than 1,300 students had signed their names to the Senate's petitions. 3 

Harris also announced that approximately 20 students had written letters for 
the Senate to submit to the legislature and that approximately 50 other students 
were writing letters that they said they were going to send from their homes. 

According to Griebel, the Senate is proud of what they have accomplished. 
"The response has been tremendously in our favor," he said. 

The Senate announced that a similar campaign was used two years ago in 
order to try to receive funds to build the HPER Building, which is now under 
construction. 

Corps plays historical music 

By VICKI SCOTT 
Staff Writer 

Marching in parades, living a part of history, and playing fifes or drums are 
all part of the activities of the Three Rivers Fife and Drum Corps. Gary Kunlz, 
recruitment chairman is seeking males or females, from high school graduates 
on, to participate in the Corps. 

The group is small at four fifes and only one drum. Kuntz says the group 
would function the most effectively at 10 fifes and at least three drums. 

Anyone who can read music can master the musical instruments in the group. 
The fife is much like the recorder, and with practice one can play in just a 
matter of weeks. The existing group will provide plastic fifes for anyone in- 
terested in learning how to play. 

The group can use anyone who has any basic drum experience and any 
standard drum can be used. The Corps hopes to gain financial backing from 
local corporations which would enable them to purchase authentic drums of the 
period. 

The Corps meets weekly at one of the members' home, but the meeting site 
will be changed to the YMCA or a similar location as participation increases. 

The fife and drum corps was originally founded in 1976. It started with a group 
of men from Magna von, but Kuntz is the only original member left. 

Kunlz, a past student at IPFW in EET, and Debby Oliver, currently a student 
here, are members. They feel that students on campus could fit Ihe group into 
ilii/ir schedule and have a rewarding experience as well. 

The Corps participates in two to four out of town events and as many events 
locally as requested by groups or organizations. 

The musical material is already amassed. The material, ordered from the 
East coast, is from a collection of folk music Irorn the 1700s The music per- 
formed is a combination of folk music and military marches. A few of the 
group's favorites are "When Johnnie Comes Marching Home," "Downfall of 
Paris" and "TheGirl I Left Behind."

Sports apathy 
problem here 



IPFW is building a new gymnasium. 
Also, in 1981-82, athletic scholarships — 
or al least partial scholarships — will be 
given to athletes who attend IPFW. 

Bui, will the new gym and scholar- 
ships alleviate the "problem" here? 

The problem is the lack of active 
student and community interest in the 
IPFW athletic programs. In one word, 
the problem is apathy. 

Much time and work goes into the 
planning and execution of the various 
sports, but much of the work js in vain 
because of the apathy. 

The past several seasons point up the 
fan apathy toward IPFW athletic events. 
The average attendance for all sports 
has been low: men's basketball, 50 to 80 
fans; women's basketball 20 to 30 fans; 
baseball and soccer, 15 to 20 fans; and 
men's and women's volleyball, 20 to 40 
fans. 

The efforts of the Athletic Office, 
cheerleaders, coaches and players, and 
the Red and Gold Booster Club seem 
futile. 

How can athletes be expected to 
perform to Iheir ultimate potential when 



the bleachers are empty and the gym 
silent? It is difficult to be an achiever 
when no one cheers you on. 

The student body is not the only 
apathetic group when it comes to sup- 
porting IPFW's athletic programs. The 
surrounding community and the Fort 
Wayne media show little support and 
recognition of the -sports here. 

Most of those who attend the games 
are relatives or close friends of the 
athletes. Other local sports enthusiasts 
ignore IPFW teams and events. 

The media, both television and 
newspapers, give very little print space 
or air time to sports played by IPFW 
teams. Even though the athletic 
program here is not large, it must 
receive adequate coverage if it is to 
grow. We don't believe two or three 
inches of coverage on page four is 
adequate coverage. 

Maybe a new gym and some 
scholarships can benefit the program, 
but somewhere along the line, students 
and the community must become in- 
volved if the program is to expand — or 
even survive. 




Dear Editor: 

; 1 would like to correct a 

■misunderstanding which 
■ might have arisen through 
iDiane Hobson's letter to the 
'editor concerning the review 
;of "1 Pagliacci." Ms. Hobson 
mentioned "a person from 
'PIT as having been 
; specifically hired by the 
;opera": no one from PIT 
■was employed to assist with 



PIT not employed 



the opera in any way. A PIT 
student, who was enrolled in 
the Opera Workshop, did 
function as stage manager 
and assist in various 
technical functions 
However, PIT Theatre was 
not officially involved in the 
opera at all. 

Further, I would like to 
thank Ms. Hobson for her 



kind words about the opera. 
Fortunately. both Fort 
Wayne Newspaper critics as 
well as many students, 
faculty and administration 
agreed with her and were 
extremely pleased with the 
entire production.

Same 'no respect' 



To the Editor: 

Stephen Judy died in the 
electric chair because he had 
no respect for the woman 
victim's body nor her life nor 
the lives of her small 
children. 

But he's not the only one 
that shows no respect for 
others. The girl IUPU 
student that parked in the 
wrong zone had no respect 
for other students and 
teachers or anyone else who 
has a paid right to park on 
the school's lot. 

Then she showed no 
respect for the officer, to 
whom she gave an obscene 
sign, and no respect for the 
uniformed symbol of law. 
Then she had the height or 
audacity and lack of respect 
for the action of the officer's 
discharging of his assigned 
duty by suing him! 

In my book she has exactly 
the same "lack-of-respect- 
for-others" attitude as the 
rapist-murderer, Stephen 
Judy.

Letter corrected 



Dear Editor: 

, This letter is in response to 
Ms. Hobson's recent letter. 
Ms. Hobson states that; if 
the person specifically hired 
by the opera would have 
shown up during the 
rehearsals, there indeed 
would have been "some 
collaboration with the IPFW 
theatre department in the 
form of coaching. 



movement, and set . con- 
struction," 

It appears that Ms. Hobson 
supposed that a member of 
the Theatre Department was 
engaged by the Music 
Department to assist in the 
staging of "I Pagliacci." 
This was not the case. No 
member of the theatre staff 
was in anyway engaged by 
the Music Department. I 



appreciate Diane Hobson's 
feelings about the opera and 
her support of same, but I 
wish she would have done 
some investigation and 
gotten her facts straight 
before writing her letter. 
Sincerely, 
Larry L. Life 
Assistant Professor

control, rather, they will die 
because of mankind's 
vanityl The pelts from these 
seal pups will be used to line 
coats or gloves and the 
blubber used to lubricate 
machines. 

The worst part of this 
tragedy is how they die. 
These pups are not shot; 
instead, they are savagely 
clubbed, grappled, and 
skinned alive. 

Please, help stop this 
bloody massacre of life. 
Support Greenpeace and The 
Humane Society of the 
United States. Please! Write

'Senioritis': an asset 



Swim 



Get 



the 



swim of 
things— join the staff of The 
Communicator. We are 
looking for writers and 
photographers who are 
willing to contribute their 
time and effort to the 
newspaper. Don't drown in 
the Sea of Boredom, 
backstroke over to Walb 
Memorial Union, Suite 215, 
and join the paper. 




Have you, like me, finally 
reached the plateau known 
as Senior in the un- 
dergraduate world of 
Academia? Are you slated 
for graduation this year — or 
next? And do you find 
yourself no longer caring? 

Are you questioning the 
true value of your degree? 
Whether it is worth the price 
of the pressures and peace of 
mind you have placed on the 
sacrificial altar of study? 
Are you tired of required 
reading and yearning for 
inspired reading? 

Is the pull of practical 
application through 
meaningful work greater 
than the fascination of 
classroom study? 

I am told this is a classic 
ailment called Senioritis. I 
retaliate that this is a classic 
case of Blaming the Vicbm, I 
submit that Senioritis is not 
an ailment, but an asset. It 
indicates a readiness to go 
forth into the Real World of 
work and productivity. It 
represents the approach of 
the goal for which our years 
of toils and troubles have 
been so vigorously spent. 
For some, It is the final step 
to self-sufficiency. For 
others, it is merely the last 
rung on the first ladder to 
success and significant 
living. 




Although Senioritis Is an 
asset and not an ailment, it Is 
a painful experience 
nonetheless Burn-Out Is a 
persistent problem and 
disillusion a constant 

companion. Weariness, 
frustration — even illness — 
set in. 

I speak from deep personal 
experience. Three weeks 
ago, I was taking steps 
toward becoming a Drop 
Out. A wise faculty member, 
the chairman of my 
department, convinced me 
that to be effective in the life- 
work of my choice, I needed 
not only this degree, but 
others; that to quit now 
would be to waste all I have 
done or hope to do. 

I chose compromise, 
avoiding the fatal choice. I 
have cut my classload, 
deferring graduation to a 
later date. This will not only 
lighten my study load but 
free up time for that 
productive work so 
necessary to my survival 
and thrival. 

It makes sense for me, for 
if I am to continue the 
pursuit of further degree(s), 
it hardly matters when I am 
working on which degree. A 
friend once told me, "It 
doesn't matter when you 
finish, it's the process that 
counts." 

Thus marks the transition 
from Drop-Out to Per- 
manent student and the 
redefinition of Senioritis 
from ailment to acset. 
Senioritis is a sign of an 
eagerness to leave this Ivory 
Tower for taller ones or for 
the Real Green World of 
other problems and 
solutions. You are NOT a 
Victim of Senioritis — you 
are a Vital Force about to 
enter the field of your choice.

ByKAVREUSSER 
Staff Writer 

If President Reagan has 
his way with proposed 
budget cuts, the new ad- 
ministration will cut off the 
Social Security received by 
students in college. 
According to Joan Churchill 
of the IPFW Registrar's 
office, this would affect 230 
students on the IPFW 
campus. 

The latest edition of the 
Social Security Bulletin 
reports that 818,000 students 
received £1,908,000,000 in 
Social Security benefits last 
year. 

A student qualifies for 
Social Security if he or she is 
unmarried, between the ages 
of eighteen and twenty- two, 
enrolled In college full-time, 
and has a parent either 
deceased, disabled, or 
retired. 

Churchill understands why 
Social Security benefits 
might be cut off to students. 

"As with anything else, 
fraudulent practices do take 
place with these Social 
Security benefits," she said. 

"Some students enroll for 
classes, receive their Social 
Security checks and then 
immediately withdraw 
without returning the 
money, "she said. 

"But," she added, "This is 
not the usual case. Most 
students receiving Social 
Security really care about 
college and try hard to stay 
in school and make good 
grades." 

She believes that some 
students who are receiving 



Social Security now and are 
going to school full-time will 
probably have to get a job 
and go to school on a part- 
time basis If their Social 
Security checks stop. 

"The job of the remaining 
parent determines whether a 
student has to quit school 
altogether. I know of one 
student off-hand whose 
mother has a good paying 
job so that it would be 
financially feasible for her to 
continue in college," said 
Churchill. 

Angela Hunt, an IPFW 
student majoring in pre- 
school education, received 
Social Security because her 
mother died when Angela 
was sail in high school. She 
disagrees with cutting 
student Social Security 
benefits as a way of 
balancing the budget. 

"It really makes me up- 
set," she said. "My dad 
couldn't afford to send both 
my brother and me to 
college. If it wasn't for Social 
Security, I wouldn't be in 
college." 

"I'm getting married this 
summer," she continued, 
"so my Social Security will 
automatically stop. But if I 
wasn't getting married, I 
probably wouldn't have the 
money for college next fall."

IS THERE 
LIFE AFTER COLLEGE? 



Sure. But its quality depends on your life during 
college. 

Your college degree and grades are most impor- 
tant. But, in today's competitive job market, you 
may need additional credentials to land the job you 
really want. 

As a sophomore, you need to look ahead. At what 
you can offer an employer.. .your education, work 
experience, leadership abilities. And at how you 
can increase these assets during your last two years 
of college. 

While looking ahead, look at the Army ROTC 
two-year program. Management training. Leader- 
ship experience. Financial assistance. And new op- 
portunities for your life after college as an officer in 
the active Army, Reserve or National Guard.

Tom ponders life, art 



BY TIM SMITH 

Staff Writer 

As Tom Golden sat at the 

bar at O'Sullivan's (in his 

special seat, the barstool 
with Linda Ronstadl's face 
adhered to it) with his 
closest comrade, in the arts, 
Jerimiah Seabolt, he already 
had a preconceived idea of 
what journalists were like. 
They were all skinny little 
guys who didn't really have 
any idea whatsoever of what 
life was all about. Well, 
that's ok, the preconception 
of artists is that they are 
skinny little guys with long 
hair and beards who don't 
understand anything outside 
the realm of cosmic debris. 
That's ok too, everybody was 
wrong, and another 
stereotype bites the dust. 

Golden is quite a guy. At 35 
years of age, he is finishing 
his senior year at IPFW as 
an art major. Not that he has 
been in school for 17 years, 
Golden didn't even start his 
formal art education until he 
was 31. 

He says that he has known 
for a long time that it was his 
calling to become an artist. 
But it took him a stint in the 
Navy and eight years on the 
railroad to figure education 
into his calling. 



He sat at the bar, sipped on 
his beer, and talked about a 
lot of things: his six year old 
son, capitalism, Ronald 
Reagan, drugs, art, his 
ambitions: how they affect 
his life and his work. 

"My six year old paints," 
he said. "As a matter of fact 
T steal a lot of my ideas from 
him. You know, all kids have 
a natural ability, too bad it 
takes them 50 years to figure 
out that they should've been 
painting like they did when 
they were six all along," he 
said. 

When asked about art in 
general Tom said that too 
many people only relate art 
to the realm of visual ex- 
pression 

"You're a writer, don't you 
consider that an art? 
Surgeons are artists, 
although they're into it for a 
little more than aesthetic 
goals Art is to synthesize a 
plastic reality, and that is 
the essence of truth," he 
said. 

"Actually visual ex- 
pression is all lies; the truth 
comes out of the reaction to a 
particular piece of art. 
Jerimiah did a painting of a 
pipe and titled it "This is not 
a pipe,'" he said, "and it 
wasn't a pipe, it was a 



painting of a pipe. There's a 
big difference." 

He lit up another Kool and 
slid his glass across the bar 
for a refill as he talked about 
Bob Dylan. 

"Dylan's music was 
regarded with such respect, 
it was thought of an in- 
sightful, relevant. He wrote 
his songs by skimming 
through the New York Times 
and finding things that 
rhymed! Which just goes to 
show that truth is in the eye 
of the beholder," he said. 

With that, the discussion 
went to the sixties and drugs. 
Morally, Golden sees nothing 
wrong with recreational 
drug use, but, having gone 
that route once in his life, has 
decided that they are not 
necessary ( particularly 
hallucinogins). "LSD isn't 
needed in visual expression, 
it creates scary monsters, 
the world has enough scary 
monsters," he said. 

Scary monsters took 
Golden by a strange quirk of 
fate, to Ronald Reagan. He 
expressed disillusionment 
at Reagan's cut in the budget 
of the National Endowment 
for the Arts. "I think there 
are better ways of 
straightening out the 
economy than to stifle in- 



tellectual expression 
said. 

He thinks loo much em- 
phasis is placed on money 
anyhow. "To be able to 
separate oneself from that 
overpowering need for 
money is what makes really 
fine people,"he said. 

Golden will be graduating 
soon, what lies ahead for 

He slammed his mug down 
on the bar, "Who the hell 
knows? I All I can say is I'll 
be there, trying to sell my 
work to anyone who'll buy 
it," he said. "My luck it'll 
probably be some fat old 
Buddhist pencil salesman 
who'll come up someday, out 
of the blue, and give me 
$5,000 for one of my pieces. 

"Actually, I believe that 
it's possible to remain a 
family man, respected in the 
conservative world," he 
said. "And yet stay so 
goddam far out that you've 
got to come up with a hit 
eventually." 




Museum preserves history 



By NANCY SLICK 
Staff Writer 

The Allen County — Ft. 
Wayne Historical Society is 
now stepping into its seventh 
decade of existence with ten 
thousand square feet of 
exhibits. Those exhibits, 
designed, fabricated and 
installed through major 
assistance from the National 
Endowment for the 
Humanities, are housed in 
the Old City Hall at Barr and 
Berry Sts 

The Historical Society 
moved into the 87 -year- old 
edifice and was dedicated on 
October 10, 1980. It houses a 
Greek immigration exhibit, 
blacksmith shop, medical 
science memorabilia, 
locomotive history. 



historical figures' 

biographies, (from Chief 
Little Turtle to Samuel 
Hanna), and many other 
displays. 

Some of the displays ex- 
plain history of the 19th 
century, industrialization, 
labor disputes, immigrants, 
ethnic groups and the post 
WorldWarllera. 

Founded in 1921, the 
Historical Society is the 
largest in Indiana and was 
recognized in 1959 as one of 
the five best in the nation by 
the American Association 
for State and Local History. 

It was originally located in 
Swinney Park in the Thomas 
Swinney Homestead, which 
was built in 1844. Swinney 
came to Fort Wayne in 1822 
and worked as a real estate 



businessman. When he died, 
his will proclaimed that the 
land be used as a pleasure 
ground open to all members 
of society. It was the first gift 
of land ever donated for that 
purpose 

The museum is devoted to 
promoting and preserving 
historical knowledge about 
the city and country. In 
April, co-sponsored by the 
Indiana American 

Revolution Bicentennial 
Commission, it will offer a 
three-day program titled 
"Transportation in the Early 
Nation: A Symposium." This 
will be a national historical 
symposium featuring some 
of the country's leading 
historians on railroad and 
canal history.

Band plays skillfully

ByGRETCHEN 
HOLODICK 
StatfWriler 

It seems odd thai Mingles, 
which used to be a 
discotheque, is having 
record crowds on the 
weekends now. It'snot really 
so odd (hough, with a band 
called Fragile to help them 
out 

Fragile, a five piece band 
from Fort Wayne, has been 
playing at Mingles Lounge 
for about four weekends 
now. Their music consists 
mostly of top-forty material, 
but they do it with expertise 
and skill. They are very 
exact in their copies of the 
originals. ■ 

What's really special 
about this group is their 
spirit, their personality. 
They are vital and alive, but 
not too flashy. They are 
happy. The positive vibes 
moving within are very 
evident, and regardless of 
what Ihey are playing they 
project this extremely 
essential image. 

Fragile is Brent Fruth on 



fretless bass, Fred Forbing 
on drums, John Forbing on 
guitar and synthesizer, 
Laura Forbing sings vocals, 
and Gavin Smith on key 
boards and saxophone. 

I got a chance to talk to 
Gavin Smith and he seemed 
positive about the band as a 
whole, "I was impressed 
with the fact thai the 
members in the band all had 
classical training, played 
piano, and that they all 
appreciated jazz and 
classical music," he said 
proudly. He also noted that 
the band was into music like 
Weather Report, Frank 
Zappa, Dixie Dregs, and 
Gentle Giant. We consider 
ourselves a Progressive- 
Jazz Fusion type of a band," 
he said. 

After Mingles, the near 
future holds a stream of one- 
nighters for the group. One 
of these being the South Side 
Prom on May 12. 

How does it look further 
down the road for Fragile? 
First of all Gavin will be 
leaving in August to further 



his education, so there will 
be only four left. The rest 
will probably go on to do 
more of their own material, 
and move onto bigger places. 
The lead guitar player, 
drummer, and bassist have 
been working hard for ten 
years to reach this goal. 

The instrumentals are 
excellent, each performed 
precisely. It is really 
amazing when the lead 
singer belts out Molly 
Hatchet, considering the 
gender, in this case, is 
female. Both the guitar and 
bass are worked with what 
seems to be ease. The 
saxophone is quite an asset 
for the band. The beat is 
smooth and forward, and as 
a whole the instruments fit 
together well. 

This particular band, in 
almost anyone's initial 
observation, is probably no 
different than any other 
band that plays top-forty in 
Fort Wayne. First im- 
pressions though, more often 
than not, don't count. This 
band not only plays with 
skill, itmakes one feel good.

Weight room open to all 



BVMIKEHOLLEY 
Slaff Writer 

Do you want to get into 
shape [or summer? Docs 
your budget restrict you 
from high cost health spas? 
The IPFW weight room, 
located in room 623 of the 
Walb Memorial Union, otters 
students a place to workout 
at no direct cost. The weight 
room is open anytime the 
building is open and contains 
several '"Universal" weight 
machines, exercise mats,

During a recent visit to the 
weight room, students said 
they were there for several 
different reasons: to get into 
shape, build muscles, and 
socialize. 

Bill Brady and company, a 
group of regulars who work- 
out live (o six evenings every 
week, said the number of 
people who use the weight 
room varies greatly with the 
weather. "When it is nice 
outside everyone starts 
thinking about getting out in 
the summer sun and they 
come running in to trim off 
the extra inches. They 
usually hit it hard for a few 
days and then never show up 
again," Bradysoid. 

Summer is not far away; 
so if you are thinking about a 
workout program, here are 
some things most books on 
weight training recommend. 
Three or four, one hour, 
workouts per week, every 
other day, will get you in 
shape fast without putting

excess strain on your body. 
Do not start with more than 
this because the muscles 
need time to recover from 
each workout. Always wear 
the appropriate dress to 
workout. Clothing which is 
not confining and keeps you 
warm such as a sweatshirt 



or complete sweatsuit is 
desirable. 

Warm-up exercises like 
side bends, toe touches, 
jumping jacks, push-ups, 
and jogging in place should 
be done for at least five 
minutes before the workout.

Tuskers win two conference 
matches; toughest to come 



BY JENS M. 
SORENSEN 
Staff Writer 

Following a two-game 
sweep of its conference 
games last week, the IPFW 
men's volleyball team finds 



itself right in the thick of the 
conference race. 

Four-set triumphs at home 
against Earlham and at 
Toledo give the Tuskers a 2-1 
conference log. George 
Williams and Cincinnati

volleyball team between matches when the team played

three straight matches. (Photo by Holden Maecker) 



have split their two games, 
so ail the (earns have at least 
one conference loss 

"We have the toughest 
part of the conference 
schedule yet," coach Arnie 
Ball warned. "'We need to 
beat George Williams and 
Cincinnati at least once to 
gel into the playoffs. " 

The Midwest Inter- 
collegiate Volleyball 
Association playoffs .pit the 
lop two teams in the "non- 
power division," in which 
IPFW competes, and the top 
four from the "power 
division." The winner will 
represent the MIVA in the 
NCAA tournament. 

After getting bombed 15-5 
in the first set against 
Earlham, the Tuskers 
rallied to win the next three 
sets in the best-of-five 
competition, 15-6, 15-9 and 15- 
11. "The kids came back 
really well." Ball said "We 
blocked well and passed 
serve well." Passing serve, 



or returning the serve to a 
designated area of the court 
to begin the offense, has been 
a consistently weak area for 
theTuskers, the coach noted. 
In what Ball termed a 
"blase match," IPFW 
downed first-year con- 
ference member Toledo, 15- 
10, 15-11, 14-16 and 15-12 The 
match didn't begin until 9 
p.m and the Tuskers "never 
got into the tempo of play," 
he said. "We didn't play with 
enthusiasm, whatever that 

The two wins boost their 
overall record to 10-13, 
surpassing last year's vic- 
tory total. In its first year of 
varsity competition, IPFW 
posted a 9-20 record last 
year. 

The Tuskers travel to 
Cincinnati Saturday for a 
rematch with the Bearcats. 
It is a must win for coach 
Ball's young squad if they 
are to remain in contention 
for the playoffs. 



room are posters depicting 
different uses of the weight 
machines. Pick out the 
exercises which fit your 
needsandsticktothem. 

Proper diet and nutrition 
are also Important factors 
for getting into good physical 
condition, the training books 
say. Never skip breakrast, 
avoid high-calorie foods, eat 
fresh fruits and leafy 
vegetables every day, drink 
several glasses of milk and 
water every day, vary meals 
to include all possible 
nutrients, and consider 
taking vitamin supplements." 

Allow time after a meal for 
food to digest, 30 minutes to 
two hours depending on the 
size of the meal before 
exercising. 

Results are not going to 
show up over night; but if 
you slick with a schedule and 
follow a proper diet, within a 
month or two the changes 
will be evident. See you in 
the weight room. ' 



Club encounters apathy 



By GLORIA HIZER 
Slaff Writer 

The newly reorganized 
Red and Gold Booster Club 
at IPFW is off to a slow start 
in recruiting memberships, 
according to William j 
Bruening, president of the 
board of directors. 

"'We have sent out over 900 
letters, mostly to campus 
people, and have had an 
incredibly poor response," 
he said and attributes this to 
a general lack of interest, 
support and awareness from 
the whole university com- 
munity. 

The purpose of the Red and 
Gold Booster Club is to 
promote the total athletic 
program at B?FW by 
sponsoring social events and 
programs, publishing a 
newsletter and raising funds 
for the athletic program. 
'"Probably the most j 
significant thing that has j 



happened to the athletic 
program on this campus is 
the $2,000 in financial aid 
which will be available for 
athletes beginning [all 
semester, 1981," said 
Bruening 

Bruening feels that these 
scholarships will attract 
talented athletes to IPFW 
and benefit the total athletic 
program He would like to 
see these scholarship funds 
increased through a greater 
membership in the Booster 
Club The benefits of a $15 
tax deductible membership 
include a window decal, 
newsletter, Foundation 
Honor Roll listing and lennis 
court reservations. 

The Booster Club will be 
sponsoring a pizza and beer 
party this semester to raise 
funds and recruit mem- 
berships. "We are also 
hoping to have some fairly 
well known sports figure to 



participate in the opening 
ceremonies of the new Multi- 
purpose Athletic Facility 
this fall," Bruening said. 

"The athletic program has 
simply not been adequately 
f un d ed or supported," sai d 



Intramural tourney begins 

ByTtMOTHYJ.ROSS 
Sports Editor 

The top eight intramural basketball teams met in first 
round play in their tournament last Monday at the Concordia 
Theological Seminary. The tournament will end the 1980-81 
intramural basketball season and decide the league cham- 
pion. 

"All the games were good,': said intramural director Kim 
Heimann; bul only four of the teams could be culled winners. 

The Mad Bombers were defeated by the Sky Kings, 56-66. 
Sioneface II finished the Slime Brothers, 62-49. The Old 
Dribblers downed the People's Choice 61-56, and the All Stars 
out dribbled the Mainframes, 61-55. 

Second round competition was lo have continued Wed- 
nesday night with the Sky Kings meeting the Old Dribblers, 
and Stoneface II taking on the All Stars, 

The championship game will be held at the Concordia 
Theological Seminary between the victors of Wednesday 
night's games on Monday, March 23, 1981, at 7:30 p.m. 



Bruening, and he hopes the 
Booster Club and its af- 
filiation with the Indiana- 
Purdue Foundation will be 
able to meet this challenge 
and provide the best possible 
athletic program for IPFW.
