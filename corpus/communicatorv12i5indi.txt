Liberal arts degree useful 



Jobs are available 



By DEBBIE 

CANTWELL 

Your friends say you're crazy, just 
wasting your time. 

But you pursue your studies, 
observing heavenly abstractions, 
mastering the nuances of foreign 
vocabularies, reading the worlts of 
Pope and Dryden, Shakespeare and 
Jonson, Hemingway and Fitzgerald. 

Then it begins to happen; slowly 
but surely you begin to doubt Che 
merits of a "liberal arU education." 

Perhaps your friends are right. 
Maybe you are wasting your time, 
chasing after stars and exotic 
languages, indulging yourself in the 
make-believe world of fiction. 

Last spring, approximately one 
out of every 12 — or a total of 744 
IPFW students — were Arts and 
Letters majors. 

However, there were 2481 students 
seeking degrees in Community 
Outreach programs such as Con- 
tinuing Education and Labor Studies 
and 2977 professional studies majors 
preparing tor careers in business, 
education, medicine, public and 
environmental affairs, music and 
technology. 

What do they know that Arts and 
Letters majors don't? 

The May issue of Money magazine 
reported that more jobs as 
engineers. clerical workers, 
cashiers, janitors, computer 
programmers, corporate managers 
and health service workers will be 
available in the 1980. 

The magazine also said there is a 
"strong case for a liberal arts 
- education," However, it staled 
humanity -related jobs will probably 
pay only an average salary of 
$11,800. 

In addition, the Indiana 
Employment Security Division 
paints a grim picture of the local 
humanities job market. According 
to a brochure put out by that agency, 
almost one of every two jobs in Allen 
and surrounding counties is in 
" manufacturing, one of every four in 
wholesale and retail trade and one of 
seven in the services industry. 

Nevertheless, Bob Barkhaus, 
career development and placement 
coordinator at IPFW, said some 
business and mental health agencies 
are potential employers, especially 
those that don't require gradual^ 
with specific degrees, 

"The Fort Wayne job market is 
favorable," he said, "but it's more 
difficult for liberal arts students to 
get good jobs.^ome of them start in 
retailing where the pay isn't good." 

Barkhaus suggested all stu- 
dents—liberal arts majors in par- 
ticular—prepare before graduation 
for the work world. 

Odds on getting a good job will 



' favor those liberal arts graduates 
who did well academically and who 
had some job -related experience, 
such as working for ^ political party 
or writing for a school newspaper, 
he said. 

In fact, humanities majors may be 
overwhelming favorites at adapting 
to the job market, if a recent study 
by the Career Center and the College 
of Arts and Sciences Placement 
Office at Indiana University, 
Blooming ton, is correct. 

Nearly 2000 I.U. art and science 
, graduates from the classes of 1971, 
1973 and 1975 were surveyed, and the 
findings revealed "one who majors 
in a field such as history or Englisl) 
has a much wider range of joli 
possibilitiesat his disposal." 

Michael Snyder and Ann Oxley. 
both English majors, are two 
examples of IPFW alumni whose 
liberal arts degrees prepared them 
for their present jobs. 

Oxley, a 1974 graduate who 
double-majored in English and 
history, is now a public relations 
director for Channel 39, a public 
television affiliate. Although her 
aspiration as an undergraduate was 
to work for the government, she said 
working for Channel 39 provides her 
with the opportunity to work for the 
public. 

Oxley started out as a journalism 
major while in Bloomington, Upon 
resuming her education at IPFW, 
however, she switched her degree to 
English. 

"There was not way to complete 
my degree in journalism at IPFW," 
she explained. "English was the 
only de^ee in which I could com- 
plete my work." 

Oxley has no regrets about her 
English-history majors. A liberal 
arts degree, she said, is the best 
possible general education and is 
good background for jobs that 
require training. Currently enrolled 
as a graduate student in IPFW's 
Division of Public and Environ- 
mental Affairs, Oxley said she has 
found her degree to be good 
preparation for graduate school. 

Snyder, like Oxley, is a public 
relations director for the Allen 
County Chapter o( the American 
Red Cross. 

The IPFW alumnus doesn't 
hesitate to say how much he loves 
his job. "I can actually help people," 
he said, "I realty can have an im- 
pact on people's Uves." 

But when Snyder was the editor of 
The Communicator and working on 
his English and Communication 
Media degree at IPFW, he might 
never have considered working for 
the Red Cross. What he then wanted, 
he said, was to be famous. 

"My priorities have changed since 



college." Snyder said. "Back then I 
wanted to be the editor of Newsweek 
or some major paper. Now it doesn't 
make any difference." 

Snyder's change in priorities 
might have been due to the many 
jobs he's had since graduation, jobs 
that sometimes involved loiig 
working hours and pressure im- 
posed by deadlines. 

Upon graduation, he discovered 
very soon there were no jobs open in 
his field. So, he found employment 
outside his field— as a U.S. treasury 
agent for the Internal Revenue 
Service— and Chat, he said, is where 
he learned the meaning of job 
satisfaction. 

"No matter what field you go into, 
you have to be interested in what you 
do or it's just a job," he said. Liberal 
arts majors risk tew job openings in 
their field and low pay for the jobs 
that do open, Snyder admitted, but 
said he was willing to take those 
risks. 

The risks apparently paid off. 
Snyder has been a jack of all 
trades— associate publisher of the 
Allen County Times newspaper in 
New Haven, advertising and public 
relations director for Hutners, 
manager of a photo studio, editor of 
Fort Wayne Magazine and Fort 
Wayne Metro, and news and public 
affairs director for radio station 
WXKE. 

Yet, the humanities major may 
still regret the time and money spent 
on a liberal arts education. 

Might a B.A. amount to tittle less 
thanB-S.? 

Julius Smulkstys, acting dean of 
Alts and Letters at IPFW, doesn't 
think so, "Arts and Letters courses 
provide students with a broad and 
philosophical understanding of the 
world and themselves," hesaid. 

Smulkstys admitted specific jobs 
tailored to liberal arts degrees are 
few, unlike technical and 
professional careers which actually 
lure students with their high salaries 
and enticing benefits. 

Unlikely as it may seem, liberal 
arts students aren't all doomed. 

Some agencies may hire students 
with broad educational 

backgrounds, regardless of their 
lack of specialized skills, said 
Smulkstys. adding the skills can be 
taught by the agency. He also said 
humanities are good preparation for 
business, law or other graduate 
schools. 

Besides employment, a lit)eral 
arts education can be personally 
rewarding, according to three 
psychologists whose recent studies 
indicated such training— "appears 
to promote increases in conceptual

■Wendt's wUd for WIPU, Ft. Wayne. 




WIPU's new 
George Wendt. 
McFadden. 



By STEPHANY HOLMES 
and BRAD LEMNA 

"WIPU was just exactly what I was 
looking for. It was a dream come true," 
said George Wendt, new WIPU radio 
station director. "In fact, I would have 
worked tor free." 

Wendt, 28, a graduate of Northern 
Michigan University in Marquette, 
worked five years at Northern 
Michigan's public radio station, WN- 
MU. He began as WNMU's music 
director and then served as develop- 
ment director. 

Feeling he had progressed as far as 
possible in those positions and hoping to 
get into management, he began a year- 
and-a-hall long search for a job in 
public radio that me t his needs. 

Wendt wahted a management 
position in a university setting and in 
the Midwest near Detroit, because both 
his wife and he have family there. He 
also wanted a small stafF to start with 
and a medium-sized market with 
potential. 

"I wanted a chance to develop my 
managerial skills and develop the 



station at the same time. The situation 
is just ideal for meat IPFW," hesaid. 

Wendt left WNMU because the 
chances of moving into management 
were slim. "The station was 
stagnating, if not regressing, due to 
linancial instability," explained Wendt. 
He feels the generally depressed 
economy of the state of Michigan 
contributed to those financial 
problems. 

Though Wendt had decided to leave 
WMNU, there was no question in his 
mind about continuing in public radio. 

"I am committed to the philosophy of 
public radio. I believe in serving the 



nmercial broadcasting. He believes 
most commercial stations have very 
little in the way of public affairs 
programming and that he sees this 
alternative broadcasting as "filling in 
holes that commercial broadcasting 
does not get." 

Wendt said WIPU has "no current 
programming philosophy as of yet, but 
it is on the way. " He added that Kilty 
Degler, program director, is aware of 
. the whole aspect of women's issues and 
will be a great help in developing this 
area of our programming. 

Wendt said he would tike to see WIPU 
offer debates and discussions about 



"( wonf (o become Involved In Ihls community and 
become part of II while I work with our staff to build 
WIPU Into (he driving community force I know It can be." 
George Wendl. IPFW Radio Slaflon Direction. 



public and providing quality 
programming that cannot be dictated 
by an advertiser," hesaid. "Often what 
we provide is a quality alternative 
though we are not for everyone." 

Jerry Medley, director of university 
relations, reiterated this goal by stating 
that he sees WiPU as an alternative to 



minority and women's issues and is 
interested in offering a regularly 
scheduled program featuring the 
Women's Studies deparCment and 
women's issues. 

"We'd be very happy to work with 
that, U would be great Co do something 
along that line," hesaid. 



Several proposed programs for the 
year include the Dan Quayle-Blrch 
Bayh debates and other politically 
oriented programs, media response 
programs and other programs aimed at 
increasing the general education of the 
pubhc. 

The new station manager also ex- 
pressed interest in attempting to bring 
WIPU into the National Public Radio 
(NPRl system, a network of over 200 
stations across the country that carry 
news and public affairs programming. 

In order to become a part of NPR, 
however, WIPU would have to maintain 
rive full-time staff members, broadcast 
IB hours a day andhavea yearly budget 
of (100,000 or more. WIPU at present 
operates with three full-time members 
and approximately half the necessary 
budget. 

He feels that the potential for com- 
munity financial support of public radio 
is excellent in the Fort Wayne area. 

"Oct. 13-20 will bring a period of on- 
air fund raising activity. We will be 
asking those who enjoy our 
programming to pledge a donation and 
show their support." said Wendt. 



"Support for Che arts Is evident In the 
community theaters, the Philharmonic 
and the ballet programs already 
established in Fort Wayne. The future 
tor public radio and for WIPU looks 
very bright, although it will take time 
andalot of effort," 

Wendt believes there is also a bright 
future in Fort Wayne for his family. He 
is married to another NMU graduaCe, 
Nancy, and has a Cwo-year-old son, 
Alexander. 

"Anywhere would have been better 
than Marquette, Michigan," he said. 
"But we are just overwhelmed wich 
Fort Wayne and could not be more 
satisfied with the move we have 
made." 

Wendt said he loves to golf and sail 
and hopes to join a service club like 
Kiwanis and the Jaycees. 

"I want Co become involved in Chis 
community and t&gt;ecome a part of it 
while I work with our staff to build 
WIPU Into the driving community force 
I know it can be." 

Despite a quiet and softspoken 
manner, one getsChe impression that 
George Wendt and WIPU are definitely 
going places. 



Agent Orange: Viet Nam veterans fear unknown affects 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

While fighting for their country in the 
jungles of Vietnam, today's Vietnam 
veterans did not realize that a defoliant 
herbicide called Agent Orange was 
being used that could possibly 
physically affect them at a future date. 

"At least 100 veterans have come in 
for physicals during the last six mon- 
ths," said Dennis Doester, veteran 
benefits counselor for the Fort Wayne 
V.A. Medical Center, 

Fort Wayne is not the only place 
where veterans are requesting treat- 



ment for symptoms that are thought to 
be caused by a herbicide sprayed in the 
jungles to kill foliage where Viet Cong 
guerrillas were thought to be hiding. 

Alleged illnesses from Agent Orange 
include various types of cancer and 
birth defects in the veteran's children. 
Another symptom is a skin condition 
called chtoracne. 

"The guys are scared tiecause they 
don't know what to expect," explained 
Butch Hall, an outreach specialist of 
the Fort Wayne Veterans Center, 

Hall explained that an excessive 
quantity of veterans are not receiving 



treatment for their ailments because of 
a lack of proof that Agent Orange 
caused the symptoms. 

The herbicide contains a contaminanC 
called dioxin which is believed to be 
toxic. 

"They know there is a form of dioxin 
that is toxic, but they have no way of 
chemically detecting whether Che 
substance in Agent Orange is toxic or 
not," said Robert E. Hann, chief of staff 
of the Fort Wayne V.A. Medical Center. 

"The government is saying that there 
is no evidence that the illness is a 



military -connected condition because 
there is no way to prove that the dioxin 
caused Ihc ailment," replied Hall. 

But Hall also explained the veterans 
should receive treatment according to 
the Code of Federal Regulations per- 
taining to Title 38 of the United States 
Code, which is the law concerning 
veterans tjenefiCs. 

A passage of Chis code slates, "When 
a reasonable doubt arises regarding 
service origin, the degree of disability, 
or any other point, such doubt will be 
resolved in favor of the claimant." 

Hall's intended meaning toward this 



passage is that there is reasonable 
doubt atwut the dioxin in Agent Orange 
and that the veterans should receive the 
benefit of the doubt. 

Robert E. Hann explained that any 
veteran who thinks he has been ex- 
posed to Agent Orange is welcome to 
come to the V.A. Medical Center for a 
physical and a series of lab tests. The 
veteran is then entitled to make a 
disability claim. 

All information will be forwarded to 
the Central Registry in Washington 
D.C. The Central Reeislry will then 



examine the tests, and from there, a 
disability board will decide whether 
disability is granted or not, 

"The tests that we are doing give us 
what we feel is the best information to 
allow determination of disability or no 
disability," replied Haan. 

Boester stated that he has filed two 
claims, but said that he did not know 
the results. 

Agent Orange was developed Just 
before World War II and replaced 
arsenic to kill Che foliage on plants. It 
has been used all over the world.

Commuiiicator goals: 
Accuracy, objectivity 



Every newspaper attempts to supply 
its readers with timely,' interesting 
stories. But beyond timely and In- 
teresting, a story must be accurate, 
objeclive and complete. 

In a recent Communicator article, a 
quote was inadvertently omitted in the 
final draft sent to the printer. While such 
omissions are infrequent — in fact 
nearly non-exislent — we at The Com- 
municator believe that even one such 
error Is too many. 

It is the goal of The Communicator, in 
every article written by our staff, to 
provide readers with complete, but non- 
embellished, facts. 

The process through which every 
article in The Communicator proceeds 
tjest exemplifies the care that is taken to 
assure our readers of receiving factual 
news. 

Story ideas are discussed by the 
editors, and those with merit are 



assigned to reporters. Use of all possible 
resources — press releases, personal 
interviews, clip files and reference 
books — are part of the assignment. 

After the facis are gathered by the 
reporter and the story written, the ar- 
ticle is reviewed by the copy editor; 
news, sports or arts editor; managing 
editor and the editor-in-chief. 

Care is taken to delete all 
editorializing or misleading statements 
and overall content and balance of the 
story are considered. If balance is 
missing or facts doubtful, the article is 
returned to the reporter to be further 
researched and rewritten. 

Still, much to our chagrin, an error 
can sneak through. 

The reputation of The Communicator 
as a responsible news source is im- 
portant to us. We will continue to strive 
to keep our reputation above reproach.

ATHLETIC DIBECTOR 

During the pasi decade, 
the IPFW athletic program 
has experienced a difficult 
and exiended infancy 
Several components have 
been offered for both women 
and men, with Ihe exad 
nalure changing every year 
or two. 

Coaching and individual 
program directing has been 
performed primarily by 
part-time, off-campus 
personnel, by volunteer 
campus staff and by one 
HPER faculty member with 
released time tor women's 
athletics. Funding has been 
derived from departmental 
income and a limited student 
athletic fee. 

The first major step to 
enhance comprehensive 
development in the in- 
tramural, recreational and 
intercollegiate programs 
will be the new Recreation 
Building, which is due to be 
completed in August 1981, 
For the first time in many 
years, the intramural and 
recreation component of the 



provides a broad base of 
diversified activity for 
students, faculty and staff, 
according to the interest and 
ability of each individual, 
will be able to expand and 
develop into a well-rounded 
program. 

The same will be true for 
club sports which provide 
opportunities for those who 
desire to organize and 
compete against outside 
competition without the 
formal requirements ol 
varsity sport status. 

The new facility will also 
finally provide a permanent 
home [or the "Tusker"' in- 
tercollegiate varsilysports, 
providing the opportunity for 
formal competition with 
other institutions in women's 
and men's volleyball, 
women's and men's 
baketball, women's and 
men's tennis, men's soccer, 
women's track and men's 
baseball. 

The primary goal is to 
establish and maintain a 
program that is compeUtive 
with any other institution of 
comparable status. The 
requirements for successful 



elude continuous promotion 
of athletics throughout the 
community, evaluation of 
the program, and pursuit of 
program resource support. 

Some initial steps have 
been taken to achieve this 
goal. 

The Red and Gold Booster 
Club has been formed as an 
affiliate of the Indiana- 
Purdue Foundation and has 
developed a diversified 
membership of individuals 
from the community, the 
alumni, former IPFW 
athletes and the campus. 

Varsity eligibility policies 
have been clarified and 
strengthened with particular 
emphasis on the concepts of

"normal progress" and 
"academic status." 

The athletic office per- 
sonnel and the participants 
have also embarked on 
"income-generating" pro- 
jects which have made 
significant contributions to 
the total program. 

The challenges con- 
fronting the IPFW athletic 
program are numerous, 
including those presented by 
the availability of the new 
facility. To enhance and 



further strengthen the 
program, additional positive 
steps need to be taken. 

"The institutional com- 
mitment to a total athletic 
program should be given 
stronger and more effective 
campus support. A program 
of financial assistance for 
student -athletes. however 
small in magnitude, should 
be developed. The athletic 
staff should be expanded 
within a well defined plan, 
beginning with the oc- 
cupancy of the new facility. 



Ty-D-Bol man: Watch out 



By NANCY SLICK 
Every time the television 
is turned on, one can see 
grown adults talking to 
margarine tubs, Ty-D-Bol 
men boating in septic tanks 
and a host of other 
ciu-iosities plaguing the air 
waves Many of today's 
[ffoduct promotion com- 
mercials appeal to the ac- 
cessibility of the emotions of 
their viewers. 

These advertisements tap 
into the ability of their 
viewers to feel guilt, shame, 
embarrassment and the 
need for acceptance by 
family and friends. They 
also make a promise of 
economic advantage to their 
viewers ... save and save 
big! 

Many people decry the use 
of these tactics as dishonest 
or unpatriotic. Why? This 
country was founded on the 
principles of free speech, 
free enterprise and the free 
sample. 

The use of television 
commercials is an effective 
way of reaching millions of 
Americans who need to learn 



proper consumer behavior. 
The answer lies In the 30 
second spots that so rudely 
Interrupt "The Rockford 
Files" and "The Muppet 
Show." These are the spots 
that play tiddley-wlnks with 
our emotions. 

One of Ihe most effective 
emotional devices In- 
corporated in commercials 
is the use of guilt, A good 
commercial will make its 
viewers feel horrible waves 
of guilt for not purchasing 
the product As one can see 
by watching television: 

You will disgrace your 
country if you travel abroad 
with a ring around the collar. 

Your cat won't love you if 
youdon'lchow-chow&lt;how. 

You will be the shame of 
your dinner guests if the 
"Spotmaker" lives in your 
dishwasher. 

You will disgrace your 
family if their clothes have 
static cling, 

Yourchildren will hate you 
if you don't bake them 
happy. 

Your husband will leave you 
if you serve him potatoes 



nstead of stuffing. 

Another popular device is 
the "join the crowd" ploy 
which moves the viewer lo 
consumerism by threatening 
loneliness: 

You will be an outcast 
unless you join the Pepsi 
Generation. 

Athletes will scorn you 
unless you turn 7-Up. 

You will never be an ac- 
ceptable member of society 
unless you are a "Pepper." 

No one will talk lo you 
unless you wear designer 
jeans. 

No one will smell your hair 
unless you shampoo with 
Prell. 

One must be wary of the 
craftiness of advertisers 
when watching television. 

Several things must be 
taken into consideration. 
How popular can V-8 juice be 
if everyone forgels lo drink 
it? How many people do you 
know have a fetish for 
squeezmg Ihe Charmin? 
Would you buy tuna from a 
dumb fish named Charlie? 
Would you lake the word of

can make a buck.

Palmer gets 
overlooked 



By KARINBUSCHER 

II was another small 
turnout at the Foellinger 
(heaire, Robert Palmer and 
F.B.C. were booked and 
somehow overlooked. The 
ratio of (he crowd of women 
three to one over men. 
Expectations from (hose 
who did come were high. 
European Robert Palmer's 
albums portray a suave, 
ultra-chic singer with a 
decent band — mellow 
thrusting progressive funk. 
Albums, or concerts, lie. 

The impression Robert 
Palmer and his band gave, 
instead of suave, debonair 
and smooth, was a wistful 
"I'm trying to be new wave" 
image. They were just too 
typical to feel excited about 
— less impressive than Boz 
Scaggs. more impressive 
than (he Babys — a white, 
all-American version of Gino 
Vanelli trying to be Graham 
Parker, 

Well, enough name- 
calling. 

Outside of their hits such 
as openers "You're Gonna 
Get l(" and "Sneakin' Sally 
Through the Alley," they did 



manage some break- 
throughs A new song, 
"Women Are Smarter," 
written by Rosalyn Carter, 
was projected in a manner 
faintly reminiscent of Little 
Feat, 

They could've pulled it off; 
that's why the show was so 
frustrating; they still needed 
more practice. 

Some uppers of (he show 
were "Under Suspicion" and 
"What's It Take" — r^gae 
rock. 

They also deserve credit 
for attempting a song 
written by new wave writer 
Gary Numan ("Cars"). 
However, the amps were so 
overprojected that one 
couldn't understand most of 
the music or words. But. like 
all his other stuff, it will pass 
on vinyl. 

If only they had in- 
corporated some horns, for 
Ihey seem (o use a lot of 
borderline jazz rhythm. If 
only they wouldn've been 
what they could've been. We 
were left high and dry. Oh, 
Robert — I guess you're still 
a he art breaker, crummy 
band and all.

Play offers humor 



By MICHELE 
DeVlNNEV 

In opening its 52nd season, 
the l^ivic Theatre presented 
"Born Yesterday," a 
comedy by Garson Kanin. 

Despite Uie fact that the 
play is over 30 years old, the 
messages contained within 
the plot reflect the attitudes 
of today. 

When Harry Brock, a 
shady junk man turned 
millionaire, played by David 
M- Rody, decides his less 
than brilliant girlfriend 
Billie needs refinement, he 
hires a reporter to tutor her. 

Within Iwo months, Billie 
becomes more aware and 
thoughtful of her life and 
surroundings Soon she's 
declaring her independence 
and becoming a surprisingly 
assertive woman. 

In addition to the obvious 
woman's theme, BiUie and 
the reporter manage a few 
strong comments abwut the 
strengths of America, in- 
jected with enough humor 
and warmth to slop short of 
righteousness. 

Charlotte Deardorff is 
nothing short of brilliant in 
the role of Billie Dawn. Her 
sensitive and charming 
performance as the slightly 
feather-brained showgirl 



with a heart of gold made the 
audience fall in love with 
her, 

Deardorff is well (eamed 
with Michael Young, as Paul 
Verrall, the reporter who 
falls in love with her. He's a 
terrific straight man for the 
wacky reasoning he en- 
counters with Billie, 

Also turning in good 
performances are (^orge 
Sandmann and Jane 
Sullivan. Sandmann plays 
Eddie Brock. Harry's timid 
lackey. Despite his 
weaknesses, or maybe 
because of them, the 
character's extremely en- 
dearing 

Sullivan could easily be 
overlooked, since she's 
featured in only one scene. 
But as Mrs, Hedges, the 
ultra-sophislicaled wife of a 
senator, she provides an 
amusing contrast to Billie, 
and her gestures and facial 
expressions throughout the 
scene are priceless. 

The set, designed by 
Robert Sandmaier. is well 
constructed. The chic hotel 
room includes a rounded 
staircase and is impressive 
without upstaging the actors. 
There's also a lovely view of 



the Capitol to emphasize (he 
Washington, D.C.selline. 

With "Born Yesterday," 
the Civic Theatre gives this 
season a fine start. Ifthis 
play is an indication of

At the Coliseum 

Loud rock reigns 



By CLAY HOUSHOLDER 

Distortion and loudness 
reigned supreme at the AC- 
DC and Blackfoot concert 
Sunday at the Memorial 
Coliseum. 

Blackfoot. from 

Jacksonville, Florida, 
started the show by serving 
up their very own brand of 
"southern fried" rock and 
roll. 

From the start of their set. 
it seemed that something 
was wrong. The coliseum is 
notorious for its poor 
acoustics, and this concert 
was a good example of poor 
sound at high volume in an 
echo chamber Don't get me 
wrong now, I enjoyed the 
show; it's just that the sound 
as a whole was a bit too loud. 
At times, there seemed to be 
no separation between the 
higher and lower pitched 
tones. 

Blackfoot. as a group, does 
a goodjobin presenting their 
show, though Sunday's 
performance was the last 
stop on their long tour, and 
they sounded like they were 
anxious to get home. 

Power chords slashed out 
at the audience with infinite 
sustentation and the 
distortion level was in- 
credible. It was nearly 
impossible to distinguish 



between the lead and rhythm 
guitars. 

Including encores, the 
Blackfoot set lasted about an 
hour. 

The arena was nearly 
tilled and hot as heck. 

It took over an hour lo 
prepare the stage for AC- 
DC, The crowd was anxious 
to get under way, and the 
heat in the building was 
starting to reach the critical 
stage. 

When the house lights went 
down to signal the start of 
AC-DC's show, a huge bell 
hung at center' stage began 
to toll. Yes, they were back 
in black, 

AC -DC is a group that is 
hard to knock if you like 
raunchy rock music. They 
have a very simple style. 
They kick out their songs in a 
hurry and end them with 
flair. Brian Johnson, the 
band's new vocalist, 
screamed the lyrics and ran 
about shaking his fists at the 
audience, getting the people 
fired up. Cliff Williams on 
bass and Malcom Young on 
rhythm guitar lay down a 
hard and fast backing for the 
group's standout, Angus 
Young, 

Angus, who plays lead 
guitar, burns up more 
calories than any other two 



guitar players put together. 
He runs, jumps and spins 
around, bouncing his head up 
and clown while playing 
some very raunchy guitar. 
Angus is a showman. The 
crowd couid not help but be 
awed with his performance. 
He is not a great player, or 
anything, but he sure does 
put 0)1 a show. 

About 20 minutes into the 
set, Angus took off his 
Gibson SG and proceeded to 
take off his clothing, pausing 
finally with the fly of liis 
trousers. Then he turned 
aroiLind and bared his buns to 
the crowd. What fun, 

F'hil Rudd, the band's 
dnimmer, hit the heads of 
his set so mercilessly it is a 
wonder he doesn't break 
something. Rudd did a fine 
Job of keeping time for the 
nrst of the group's simple but 
r£iw and exciting set. 

In retrospect, Blackfoot 
and AC-DC put on a good 
isliow, in spite of the poor 
,'icoustics in the Coliseum. 
IVIaybe if the volume level 
"/ould have been decreased a 
l;'it, the sound would have 
';«en a bit better. Other than 
that. I like distortion and 
loudness, I got a good 
helping of it on Sunday ni^t 
and my ears are still ringing.

New Yes 
successful 



By GRETCHEN 

HOLODICK 

With the departures of lead 
singer Jon Anderson, and 
Rick Wakeman, who was on 
keyboards. Yes is now a 
regenerated band. 

They are now a five man 
set-up, including Sieve Howe 
on guitar, Chris Squire on 
bass and piano, and Alan 
White on drums. Two 
newcomers are Geoff 
Downes on keyboards and 
vocoder and Trevor Horn on 
bass. 

The new Yes has just 
released a new album, 
"Drama," that parallels 
"Going For the One" to a 
degree. 

Within the composition of 
the new album, there are 
certain characteristics that 
are reminiscent of a past 
Yes, The intonation is 
similar to the "Fragile" 
sound heard earlier in their 
career. 

The album kicks off with 
"Machine Messiah," which, 
while it is the only extended 
cut, lasts a mere ten 
minutes. 

One of the best parts of this 
particular LP is Horn's and 
Squire's basses, though 
Squire's work is probably

Norman Bradley. 

assistant professor of Fine 
Arts at IPFW, will be 
showing oil paintings 
completed in the last year 
and not previously show

His work is non- 
representational in nature. 
He thinks of these works as 
visions rather than paintings 
— intuitional visions that 
hopefully will strike a chord 
in the viewer. 

Dixie Bradley's 

photographs were taken 
during a recent trip to 
Mexico' where the people 
present a constant 
challenge. The photographs 
are "nature" shots. 



more creditable. The track 
"Tempust Fugit" puts 
Squire in the spotlight and. 
for once, we can actually tell 
the difference between the 
various instruments easily 
and accurately. 

"Does it Really Happen" 
is another breakthrough for 
Yes. mainly because the 
rhythm is finally brought 
forth, and White receives the 
credit he deserves. With the 
drums accentuated and a 
consistant pulsating drive, 
this is one of the best songs 
on Che album. 

"Into the Lens" and "Run 
to the Light" are probably 
Che sore spots in "Drama." 
If nothing else, the songs are 
meaningful and nice, yet 
they seem to lack the ex- 
citement of the first side of 
(he album. 

All in all, "Drama" is a 
good album, especially for 
those who have enjoyed Yes 
inChepasC.

^Bodyguard^ nice film 



ByMIKEGEFFEN 

Nice films are rare. 

If a film isn't a car crash 
comedy, a commerical for 
an album, a blood and guts 
thriller, or have a budget of 
10 million and up, it doesn't 
seem to get made anymore. 

The small, personal film 
that used to be Hollywood's 
mainstay has all but 
disappeared. "Small" films 
today are touted as 
breakthroughs and are 
lumped together. For this 
reason. Che latest small film, 
"My Bodyguard." is being 
compared to "Breaking 
Away" and "Rocky." It isn't 
like Chose films, as many 
critics have claimed, and it 
deserves to stand on it's own 
merits. 

If anything, the film is 
similar to "Foxes." Like 
that film, "Bodyguard" is 
about friendship and its 
importance, and it treats 
teenagers as people, not 
caricatures. The film's 
simple theme is brought out 
by good performances and a 
remarkably intelligent

habit most schiMlyard films. 
Credit for that goes to the 
great cast and the level 
direction of Tony Bill. Bill 
doesn't cutsey things up, a 
temptation inherent in any 
film about kids, and he 
makes the characters in- 
teresting. Bill has a great 
feel for individuals and 
personalities. All the 
characters seem real. 

Bill also has an eye for new 
talent, as the cast of the film 
shows. The parts are filled 
by relative newcomers who 
are excellent. Chris 
Makepease, as Clifford 
Peache, the constant victim, 
is good. He has the right low 
keyed sensitivity tor the role 
and shows a flair for depth of 
expression that older, more 
experienced actors don't 
have. 

Adam Baldwin, as Lin- 
derman, Clifford's 

bodyguard, is also good. He 
makes Linderman likable 
without losine his menacing 



aspects. Matt Dillion, as 
Moony, the bully, is 
believable in the only role 
which could be taken 
somewhat as a caricature. 
His part is slightly one- 
dimensional, but he does 
well in the confines of the 
role. 

The grown-ups in the cast, 
Ruth Gordon, Martin Mull, 
and John Houseman, are all 
excellent, and make thier 
bits in the film entertaining. 

The script, by Alan 
Ormsby, is tilled with 
believable dialogue and 
situations. He shows a talent 
for naturalistic scenes. His 
split one reason older 
people can relate to the film. 
Anyone who has been 
terrorized by anyone or 
anything can relate to the 
film. 

"My Bodyguard" is quite 
simply, a nice little film that 
makes you feel good after 
you leave the threatre. This 
personal film doesn't 
deserve to be pigeon-holed 
with all the other so-called 
little Sims.

By MICHELE 
DeVlNNEY 

As she celebrates her 20lh 
anniversary in the music 
industry. Diana Ross con- 
tinues to be the most con- 
sistently successful female 
vocalist in the country. 

Her newest album, 
"Diana," is her most 
popular recording to dale, 
and the single, "Upside 
Down," is currently number 
one. It's hard to turn on a 
radio without hearing that 
song, and rightly so. The 
tune has a punchy, high- 
powered arrangement and 
Ross' vocals are perfect. 

Unfortunately, the rest of 
the album doesn't quite live 
up to that high quality level. 

Ross' major mistake 
continues to be her inability 
to settle down to one 
producer and one sound long 
enough to develop a solid 
style. She tends to get caught 
up in trends that have led to 
production changes three 
timesin the last four years. 

This time, Ross is handled 
by Bernard Edwards and 
Nile Rodgers, (he master- 
minds behind the disco 
megagroup Chic. Chic's 
influence is greatly felt. In 
fact, the album could easily 
be credited to "Chic — 
featuring Diana Ross," 
because their sound is 



practically oozing off the 
vinyl. 

Side one has somewhat 
beUer material than the flip 
side. It starts with "Upside 
Down" and "Tenderness," a 
fairly catchy song, but 
nothing specifd. 

One of the better cuts on 
the album is "Friend to 
Friend," a l&gt;allad which 
offers an excellent showcase 
for Ross' more subtle vocal 
techniques and allow; her to 
display fine range and 
power. 

"I'm Coming Out," the 
final cut on side one. Is 
another good dance song that 
has enough R&amp;B flavor to 
keep it from getting boring. 

Side two is pretty mun- 
dane. In fact, if it weren't for 
the breaks between tunes, 
you'd never know (he songs 
had changed. And once 
again, the Chic sound is so 
dominating that it could 
easily obscure a lesser 
talent. 

But Ross does manage to 
prevail. Given what she had 
(0 work with, she still injects 
an element of soul so innate 
within her that It breathes 
life into otherwise mediocre 
music. 

"Diana" is a must for 
disco fans and Diana Ross 
Junkies,

Scare 4th ranked Spring Arbor 



Soccermen Split pair 



By GARY 

BAUMGARTNER 

The IPFW men's soccer 
team currently slands at 2-1 
(or the young season, as it 
defeated St Joseph College 
last week and then fell to 
national power. Spring 
Arbor, on Saturday, 

The Tuskers (raveled lo 
Rensselaer to play a stub- 
born SI Joseph College learn 
and produced (wo goals in 
the overdme period (o defeat 
the Pumas, 3-1. 

The Tuskers had 
numerous opportunities to 
score on their hosts, bul 
couldn't get the ball into the 
net, IPFW look 47 shots on 
goal as compared lo St , Joe's 
21, 

James Henmueller scored 
lirsl for the Tuskers, His 
goal came In the first half 
with assistance from Chris 
Warn and Tom Johnson. 

In overlime, Jim Sharpe 
scored on a breakaway to put 
(he Tuskers up, 2-1, Johnson 
again assis(ed on the goal. 

Then, II was Johnson 
again, this time scoring by 
himself on a long shot, who 
provided the final margin. 

Slefanklewicz was pleased 
with the win, bul less than 
happy wilh the Tusker's 
play. "II wasn't one of our 
better games." he said later. 

On Saturday Stefan- 
Wewicz had lo face fourth- 
ranked Spring Arbor 
College wilh a depleted 
squad, FTeshman defender 
Mark Gabrek was unable lo 



play due lo illness, co- 
captain Dave Husar was slill 
feeling (he effecls of week- 
long flu, James Henmueller 
was al less than full strength 
due to pulled muscles in both 
legs, and veteran Dan 
Verslynen had lefl (he team 
after quitting school, 

Bul Slelankiewici&gt; and his 
(cam put on a strong showing 
against the Cougars at the 
IPFW nihletic field. They 
played a light man-to-man 
defense, concentrating on 
containing their guests 
ihroughoul the game, 

The wind played a major 
factor in the Tusker game 
plan, as they had to face a 
strong headwind in the first 
half, but had It al (heir backs 
in the second half to take 
some pressure off their goal. 

The IPF^ players per- 
formed extremely well 
against the skillful Cougars, 
Especially effective was 
goalie Dennis Knuth. making 
several exccllenl saves in 
the first half. Due lo several 
factors, including the wind, 
the field and the accurate 
passing of Spring Arbor, Ihe 
first half belonged almost 
exclusively to iheCougars. 

The second half produced 
a Tired-up Tusker squad, and 
they played their guests 
even, if not lo a slight ad- 
vantage, Bul slill. the Tusker 
game plan was to play tight 
man-lo-man andconcentrate 
on containing the Cougars, 

As the game progressed, 
however. Tusker play grew 



loose, and. with 11 minutes to 
go in the game, the Cougars 
look advantage of a defen- 
sive mistake lo score. 

Mike Brownpeterside of 
Spring Arbor brought the 
ball down the right sideline 
and crossed il in front of the 



IPFW goal, Husar, playing 
stopperback, found himself 
along in front of the goal with 
Spring Arbor's Paul Kwato. 
Husar tried to clear the ball. 
but mlskicked and the ball 
dribbled into Ihe Tusker 
net.The goal was officially 



I Kwato wilh 
assist from Brownpeterside.

formance of everyone," 
Volsinsaid, 

Regarding the win against 
St. Mary's, Voisln com- 
mented, "The freshmen did 
an outstanding job. Our

Baseball finishes 



ByMIKEFRANKE 

Baseball coach Larry 
Windmlller'a fall squad will 
complete Iheir autumn 
session this weekend with a 
doubleheader scheduled 
against Grace College on 
Saturday, 

Last weekend, the Tuskers 
held a fifty-hour marathon 
game on Carrington Field. 
The purpose of the game was 
to raise funds for some badly 
needed equipment for the 



start of the spring season. 

Last Sunday, the team 
traveled to Indianapolis to 
battle lUPUI In a 
doubleheader. The Tuskers 
lost both games of the 
double-dip, 5-3 in the opener 
and 10-2 in the second game. 
Doug Grover hit a home 
run for the Tuskers in the 
nightcap. Windmiiler did get 
an opportunity lo look al the 
pitching talent, as five pit- 
chers were used in the two 



games. 

Windmiller's squad is 
composed mainly of fresh- 
men this fall, so he hopes the 
abbreviated schedule wllJ 
give the young players 
needed seasoning before the 
regular spring season. 

Windmiiler hopes that a 
mixture of a few veterans 
with a group of good, young 
talent will provide for a very 
exciting 1981 baseball

Sports funds limited 



BySUESNODGRASS 

A common complaint 
heard from many of the 
IPFW coaches is about the 
lack of money available to 
supply their teams with 
desired equipment. 

This, however, is not a new 
problem . 

According to David 
Skelton, athletic director, 
"The entire lathletic) 
department is financed on 
what it can raise for itself. 
The university gives us no 
money." 

"The whole budget is built 
on two major sources." he 
said. "One. the student 
athletic fee of S15, which 
accounts for 70 percent of the 
budget, and two. Income 
generated by the depart- 
ment's revenue sports, 
men's and women's 
basketball and volleyball. 
The Red and (Jold Booster 
Club also supports us," The 
department also draws a 
small sum from public use of 
the tennis courts, he said. 

The money raised is 
distributed among 13 dif- 
ferent budgets and must 
cover expenses such as 
coaches' salaries, any staff 
trainees' salaries, gym- 
nasium rentals, main- 
tenance, the club sports 
account and intramurals. 

For varsity sports, ex- 
penses include insurance, 
traveling expenses, 
equipment and playing court 
reitais. 

According to John Ulmer, 
dean of Student Services, 
"The only direct Hnancial 
commitment the university 
supports is Dr Skelton's 
salary and any full time 
secretary's salary." 



The Athletic Department 
isn't funded by the linivcrsity 
l&gt;ccause, Ulmer said, "This 
university originated as an 
academic institution. 
Historically, athletics have 
been looked upon as 
secondary or auxiliary as an 
outside activity. The 
university funds the 
discipline that it was founded 
for," 

Ed Stefankiewici, men's 
soccer coach, said "1 would 
like lo see the university pay 
half the expenses. One pair 
of soccer shoes costs $40 and 
there are over 20 members 
on the team Ihis year." 

Peggy Voisin, coordinator 
of women's athletics, said, 
"The university needs better 
relations wilh the Athletic 
Department It needs to help 
support, to get the students 
and the communitv in- 



volved," Both Stefankiewicz 
and Voisin would like to see 
the university offer athletic 
scholarships 

The new athletic building 
seems to be Ihe promise for 
more money and student's 
sports involvement. "The 
building will have three 
gymnasiums, which will cut 
court and gym rental ex- 
penses," Skelton said, "It 
will hopefully gel more 
students involved in athletics 
and allow for the students 
and faculty to interact. It 
will also draw more public 
attention to the campus' 
athletic programs," 

Ulmer said, "The new 
athletic building wjtl 
allow the university to offer 
a physical education minor. 
Hopefully this will attract or 
recruit studenls to this 
campus." 



Netters win 1st 



ByNICKSTANGER 
The IPFW women's tennis 
learn claimed its first vic- 
tory of the season against 
Goshen Collie. 6-3, last 
Wednesday afternoon. 

Coach Ben Becker was 
pleased with Ihe women's 
outstanding performance 
and combined team effort on 
Wednesday, He feels that a 
strong team spirit is 
beginning to develop, though 
a lack of practice still shows 
al times. 

Singles players who won 
their matches were Carey 
Shifferly. Phyllis Meredith, 
Mai7 Lou Pease. Dede 
Rippeloe and Tina Chester; 
doubles winners were Kiser- 



Shifferly and Meredith- 
Pease. Although number one 
player Cindy Kiser didn't 
win her singles match, "she 
played extremely well 
against a tough opponent," 
said Becker. 

Upcoming matches 
elude the first 
varsity vs. women's faculty- 
staff team competition. Sept. 
29 from 11:30 untU the early 
afternoon al IPFW. Becker 
encourages interested 
women faculty-staff 
members to contact Keren

Also, the team faces St. 
Joseph College. Rensselaer,
