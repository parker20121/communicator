ter Campufi as the majority party 
In government.

sophomore. Last year, he was a

I ^\, i.^t:-: atlons Committee. He was the 

— ^^'MsSt only Senator to have been present 

for all roll call votes. He has 
also served on the Bureau of the 
Budget, the Joint Committee of 
the Indiana Faculty Senate, and 
the Committee on the Handicap- 
ped. 

The new Student Body Vice 
President was also an active Stu- 
dent Senator last year. Mr. Hen- 
son Is 22 years old and an ex- 
serviceman. 

President Able has yet to fill

capable persons who can continue 
the buslneSB-lifce procedures of 
last year's government, Dave

For the Information of all In- 
diana-Purdue freshmen and new 
students, there are two locations

change. 

The Indiana-Purdue Bookstore 
Is located on the bottom floor of 



spring when the original site had 
to be abandoned unexpectedly. 

A second project planned Is to 
help organize student participa- 
tion In moving the library, set 
for September 20. The hooks 
will be carried by hand to the 
new library building, with nearly 
25,000 trips between buildings ne- 
cessary. President Able hopes to 
enlist enough students so that the 
library will be non-functional lor 
one day only, 

Mr. Able Is looking to betterthe 
already well-organized intramural 
programs on campus. He feels 
that this Is one area where many 
students take an active Interest 
In the activity program. Working 
with the established Intramural 
programs, he hopes to expand and 
Incorporate other sports and acti- 
vities. He would like to Involve 
as many people In as many acti- 
vities as possible. 

The new administration plans to 
continue the projects of the past 
governmeni. These Include voter 
registration, student evaluations of 
faculty, a student directory, and the 
Free University, 

The key to the success of the 
Students' Government Is finding 
people who will give thelrtlmeand 
energy by working on projects. 
Mr. Able Is hoping that a great 
number of students will become 
Involved In campus politics. 

Summing up his goals for the 
year. President Able pledges to 
fulfill the spirit of the motto of 
the Students' Government - "A 
government serving and protecting 
the students."

CircIeK 

Interratlonal Circle K-Indlana- 
Purdue Unlversliy Chapter was 
one of the first all-eervice or- 
ganlzaclons tu become a focus of 
attention at this campus. Pre- 
viously an all-male organization, 
Circle K o( Indiana-Purdue re- 
ceived Its charter on May 20, 
1965. It was during the following 
year that Circle K took on Its first 
full-time service project - man- 
ning the I-PU coatroom. This 
room, located outside of the stu- 
dent lounge, also serves as the 
club's headquarters and meeting 
place. 

Circle K went co-ed during the 
fall of 1971, thus boosting not 
only Its membership, but also Its 
service potential. Past projects 
Include the WOWO Penny Pitch 
bathtub push, Multiple Sclerosis 
fund drives. Red Cross blood drive, 
ouilngs for the Fort Wayne Chil- 
dren's Home orphans. Scholarship 
Movie Theatre, food drives for 
the needy, Leadership Conference, 
and student tours of the campus. 
Circle K does pause from its 
service duties to enjoy life at 
parties and get-togethers that av- 
erage almost every other week, 
though! 

I-PU's Circle K has also proven 
to be f/l In the district of Indiana. 
Topping nine other Indiana clubs, 
our Circle K won, for the second 



year, the Governor's trophy - the 
highest district award. Thlschap- 
ter has also brought home sever- 
al top place awards and trophies 
since Its 1965 beginning. 

If you say "Why should I join 
any club when I'm transferring 
to the main campus next year?" 
well, Circle K has clubs at In- 
diana, Purdue. Manchester, Ball 
State, Trl-State and several o- 
thers! What a better way to get 
acquainted with a new university 
than through fellow Circle K-ersI 
Joining Circle K is very simple. 
Just drop by the coatroom any time 
and ask any member for a mem- 
bership form. Join us. won't you. 
for one of the most rewarding ex- 
periences you can have at col-' 
lege I
