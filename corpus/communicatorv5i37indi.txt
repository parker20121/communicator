Desmond feels 
complaints valid 



By KURT ULLMAN 

The University administration 
realizes that the faculty has a 
legitimate complaint regarding their 
salaries, but feels that there is little 
that can be done locally, according to 
Richard L. Desmond, dean of faculty 
at I.U. 

' ' I think that the University has to 
be as sensitive as possible to the 
impact of inflation on faculty and 
staff at this University and give them 
raises that they consider as close to 
meeting those inflationary trends as 
is possible," said Desmond. He also 
stated that the University should 
determine how large an increment 
they think they can give, commen- 
surate with the business of running a 
University. 

Desmond noted that the guide- 
lines for the increase given to faculty 
here had been received from 
Bloomington. The local administra- 
tir 1 is given the guidelines and has 
li e or no discretion on wage levels 
01 side of the mandate. 

It was pointed out by Desmond 
tl t these increases were the same 
tr oughout the I.U. campus system. 
This is probably the proper system to 
follow," said Desmond. "As long as 
we are a part of Indiana University, I 
don't see that there is a need or even a 
great deal of wisdom in having each 
campus compete against the other in 
giving faculty the greatest increase." 
He also stated that he felt that there 
should be equal treatment of the 
faculty no matter where they were 
teaching. 

Desmond believes that the faculty 
of one campus should not be penalized 
because the city in which it is located 
is not generating the enrollment, 
resulting in tuition monies needed to 
pay higher salaries. He pointed out 
that under this system, the faculty at 
Bloomington could receive a higher 
increment than the faculty at 1U-PU. 
He noted that he did not think that the 
instructors here would be pleased 
with that arrangement either. 

When questioned on the subject of 
collective bargaining for the faculty, 
Desmond felt that such measures are 
not in the general best interests of the 
faculty or the University. 

"Generally, it would create more 
problems than it would solve, largely 
in the professional areas." He thought 
that discussions by unions on working 
conditions and wage increases swiftly 
spread into other areas such as class 






are allowed to do. 

He envisioned that some of the 
faculty might one day want to do 
more than was required in a contract 
and not be able to do so. He felt that 
such actions lessen the professional 
independence of the individual faculty 
member. 

Desmond hopes that ; 
stoppage does not happen 
campus, noting that the administra- 
tion certainly does not encourage 
such action. He hoped that such a 
venture would not be needed. 

"There have been very few work 
stoppages across the country and I 
would hope that Indiana University 
would not be among the first to do so. " 
he said. "It is not an appropriate thing 
for a University faculty to do." 

The impact on the University 
itself and thus the students would be 
different at various times throughout 
the semester, according to Desmond. 
The variables being when, how long, 
and how complete the stoppage was.

The committee searching for a 
super-chancellor for Indiana-Purdue 
has narrowed the field down from 244 
applicants to seven, according to 
Walter E. Helmke, vice-chairman of 
the Search and Screen Committee. 

The committee has invited seven 
men, none of which have direct 
afflialion with IU-PU, to the campus 
to be interviewed for the super-chan- 
cellor post. 

Those to be interviewed are: 
William A. Jenkins, dean of the School 
of Education of Portland State 
University; Stanley B. Kegler, vice- 
president for administration of the 
University of Minnesota; Charles J. 
Merdinger, vice-president of Human- 
istic Studies of Aspen Institute; 
William R. Monat, dean of faculites of 
Baruch College; Jack M. Ryder, vice 
chancellor and dean of administration 
affairs at Indiana University-Purdue 
University at Indianapolis; Donald 
Schwart2, acting president of State 
University College at Buffalo; and 
John Williams Snyder, executive vice 
chancellor of the University of 
California. 

"This list (of the seven men) is 
final as far as the 2-M applicants are 
concerned. It's Final considering we 
get at least one candidate from these 
interviews," said Helmke. 

Helmke noted thai although seven 
are being interviewed, there is a 
chance that the committee may not be 
able to find even one to recommend to

Screen Committee v 






Sociology professors to present 
paper on power in politics 



By CAROL REEVES 



Indiana-Purdue, will travel to San 
Jose, California for the annual 
meeting of the Pacific Sociological 



entitled Power Concentration and 
Political Democracy: Theory and an 
Example. The example is Watergate 
and its effects on political democracy 

in the United States. 

The meeting is a series of sessions 
attended by professors, sociologists 
and graduate students. Papers are 
submitted a month prior to the 
meeting and those selected are read 
and discussed during t 



The paper represents 
three and a half months of work, 
beginning with its inception last 
December. Following the reading and 
discussion in California, Zusman and 
Mahmoudi hope to rework their paper 
and incorporate some of their 
colleagues' criticisms into it. The 
paper will then be submitted to a 
sociological journal for publication. 

Essentially, the paper deals with 
theories of power concentration and 
implications for political democra- 
cies. It examines Watergate and what 
Watergate means in terms of political 
democracy. "We are not interested in 
personalities," says Mahmoudi. "but 
rather in the political institution and 
the impact of Watergate on it." 

Mahmoudi and Zusman arrived 
at three general conclusions. First, 
centralization is increasing so far as 



political power is concerned. Second- 
ly, political democracy is affected 
negatively. "We see Watergate as 
decreasing political democracy, at 
least for a period of time," Mahmoudi 
explained. Finally, the aftermath of 
Watergate could provide the United 
States with a better functioning 
government, a resurgence of political 
democracy. 

"In the paper we tried to look at 
Watergate from a structural point of 
view-how it has affected the 
structure of American society. We 
were concerned with the value of 
political democracy and its impact on

education," Mahmoudi relates. "The 
educational value that is significant 



about Watergate is that by looking at 
it objectively and analytically, we can 
learn from it. It must be understood 
by the young people especially." 

Zusman believes that '■Watergate 
reaffirms the power of the elite. The 
United Stales does not truly have a 
represent alive government," says 
Zusman. "It's surprising that Water- 
gate even came to the attention of the 
American public." He points out that 
it was only by the efforts of two new 
non-established journalists that 
Watergate was brought forward. '

screening applicants and coming up 
with a list of at least five approved 
candidates to give to the presidents 
for consideration. 

Helmke pointed out that since 
these men are just being interviewed, 
it is not known how many of them 
would even accept the job if it was 
offered to them. "Maybe just two or 
three of them will be interested." 

Each of the seven men will spend 
two days on campus, being inter- 
viewed by students, faculty, and staff.

■ filing for office and 
voting for candidates. 

Aspirants for the office of Student 
Body President and Vice-President 
must be running mates, one from 
P.U. and the other from I.U. They 
must both be taking nine-credit hours 
this semester and be enrolled in a 
degree-seeking program. All candi- 
dates must have been attending 
classes at this campus for at least one 
semester before their filing. The 
person wishing to become president 
must be a second-semester freshman 
before he is eligible. 

For those who want to be a 
Student Senator, the requirements 
are less severe. Any Senate candidate 
must have an academic schedule of 
nine or more hours, and a Grade Point 



Average (GPA) of 2.00 (I.U.) or 4.00 
( P.U. ) . Those who run as a slate must 
field at least five candidates from 
each University and not more than 
two from each school may be taking 
less than nine-hours.

thirty students are needed to qualify 
for a position on the ballot and the 
petition must be returned to the EB 
before April 9 The board will then 
check the qualifications of the 
candidates and inform them or a 
representative of the state if there are 
any irregularities.

slates must file with the EB a full 
disclosure of election expenses not 
less than 24 hours before the elections. 
Failure to do so will result in 
exclusion of the candidate or slate 
from the ballot. 

Another major part of the code 
spells out exactly who will be eligible 
to vote in the elections. Any student 
who is enrolled in at least one credit 
hour may participate in the election 
for next year's Student Government. 
All voters must have proof of 
identification before they may vote. 
Geber said that an Activity Card 
would be preferable form of identifi- 
cation but that a driver's license or 
other type of ID would be accepted. 

"The Election Board has met 
several times this semester to discuss 
and clarify some of the procedures to 
be used in this year's elections," said 
Gerber. "They will be enforced 
equally and we will be as fair as 
possible to all concerned."

Leonid writes home about U.S. 



The IU-PU 7 



The super-chancellor committee has publicized its final or 
semi-final list of candidates for the job. Only one affiliated or 
semi-affiliated candidate remains in the running. The rest are 
interestingly enough not even from the Midwest. 

The IU-PU 7 will come individually to campus for interviews by 
students, faculty, and staff, and presumably the committee itself. The 
results of these interviews will be used in developing the final 
recommendations that the committee will send to the two presidents. 

The IU-PU 7 may be reduced to the IU-PU 1 or even zero, according 
to comments made by committee members. Some candidates may no 
longer be interested in the job, and others may prove to be less than 
eminently qualified. 

It appears that the committee may choose the candidate it prefers to 
see be appointed to the position. At least that is the impression this 
newspaper gets from certain cum miller members.$ 

It is possible that the committee will not be bound by the presidential 
request for a list of at least five names for consideration. The committee 
may decide that there are not five qualified people for the job, at least not 
among the 244 that applied. 

If the committee decides that none of the seven are qualified to be 
super-chancedllor. what next? Will the whole process begin again? Will 
the arrival of the super-chancellor be postponed until 1975? Will the 
presidents use that as an excuse to name their own man, who may or may 
not already be chosen? 

It is not certain how thoroughly the c ommittee has considered these 
questions. It is also not certain how probable it is that none of the seven 
will prove acceptab le. 

With a little bit of luck, and IU-PU is about due, a superman is among 
the seven.

and soon back in Mother Russia I am. 
Affairs of state, denials of exit vissas 
to those troublesome Jews, and 
suchlike matters no doubt will occupy 
my time for some days when once 
again in Moscow I will be. So that you 
shouldn't think I am ignoring you, my 
little Vodka petal. I am now writing 
this letter, you should only live long 
enough to read it. 

"Is passing strange, Natosha; 
this odd country-their dictator (oh, I 
forget, he is called "President'-isn't 
that funny? At home, our 'President' 
is a nothing) is being investigated by 
their Presidium (ah, yes, Congress). 
And he is being investigated by an 
agent taken from a college— can you 
believe that? A college professor. 
Comrade Cox! -who is in turn 
appointed by the Chief of Justice, 
Comrade Richardson from the trea- 
sonous republic of Massachusetts. 
And this Richardson is himself an 
appointee of the President. I do not 
understand it. Can you imagine, my 
adorable consolation prize, what we 
would do if these piddling agents of 
reaction tried to investigate us? 
Siberia is not yet filled up! 

"I tell you, my precious Lips of 
the Caucasus, they took me in 
Washington by churches, temples, 
mosques, synagogues-and people, 
well-dressed people!-even, I am told 
(I do not believe it) government 
operatives at the highest echelons are 
known to frequent these places. They 
say (it cannot be) that even the 
leaders of state are not ashamed to be 
seen in places of foolish worship. No 
wonder beloved Nikita Khrushchev, 
or something like that, his name 
was-our predecessor once, I believe I 
have mentioned him to you) said we 
would bury this insane land! 
Contmplate, Natosha, grown men, the 
powers of the regime, in churches. I 
am still rubbing my eyes in 
wonderment. 

"But wait, volumptuous Wings of 
Georgia, there is more. At dinner one 
night, I met an avowed Jewish 
millionaire-don't laugh, an avowed 
Jew-and leaders of laborers who 
have the affront not only to eat with 
the Dictator and his guests but also, at 
any time, to take their hordes out on 
strike against the will of The People. 
Let me repeat, Unmatched Umbilical 
Cord of the Ukraine, labor 'leaders' 
dare to lead the'ir cadres out from 
work, into picket tines, protesting the 
good of The People. 



"My head still swims, Natosha, 
Serene Serb, as I ponder the borders. 
They took me to the North, to the

machine guns! No tanks! No barbed

can this be? Obviously the American

What power this Nixon has, to own 
Canada and no one knows! 

"Incomparable Easter Egg, they 
are almost ready here to ration 
petrol, which will keep those hundred 
million automobiles from traveling so

Before 1 could catch my breath, I 
found myself on the staff of the 
Communicator. My name is LaJean 
Ray and I'm black. I'm also married, 



Cosmetics exploit fairy-tale beauty 



"Mirror, mirror, on the wall 
"Who's the fairest one of all?" 
The first stories I learned at my 
mother's knee were fairv tales like 
"Snow White." "Cinderella" and 
"The Sleeping Beauty" in which the 
heroine was always the "Fairest in 
the land." (Today we'd call them 
"Miss Americas "&gt; The mora! was 
clear: Beauty is what makes a 
woman desirable. 

The double standard was equally 
clear: a beauty could love a beast, a 
princess could kiss a frog, but did 
anyone ever take an ugly step-sister 

Naturally, being told 1 was pretty 
meant more than the straight A's I got 
in school. But as I grew older, I 
learned I wasn't pretty in "the right 



to the magic camera of the fashion 
magazines which tell us that the 
"fairest in the land" are tall, thin, 
chiseled-cheekboned, blonde models. 
This kind of brainwashing explains 
the following story which I call 
"Beauty and the Buck." 

Once upon a time in my 
quasi-liberated days, I went to one of 
those makeup centers where for $7.50 
and all the cosmetics they can sell 
you, you get a lesson in the "right 
way" of makeup. Here's what my 
makeup artist, Mr. Freddie, pre- 
scribed for the "natural look" I had 






i the 'i 






The only concession from Mr. 
Freddie that my physiognomy wasn't 
a total disaster was that I didn't need 
false eyelashes My own lashes were 
long enough. 

My mouth might have been OK, 
except that my lower lip was a teensy 
bit fuller than my upper lip. So Mr. 
Freddie made the necessary sym- 
metrical adjustments outlining my 
lips with a brown pencil, painting 
them in with some orange-toned 
lipstick, and sloshing on an ounce of 
lip gloss, Then he added something 
shiny tn highlight my temples. 

And finally, to protect my 
natural, easy-to-apply makeup, Mr. 
Freddie pointed an aerosol can of fixit 
at my face. That I firmly declined. 



But I must admit to my everlast- 
ing shame that not only did I pay for 
this "beauty lesson," I actually 
bought some makeup. How could I not 
be pretty after an hour's makeup 
artistry. 

As I left the shop, however, I kept 
staring at every mirror I passed and 
not to admire myself fas passersby 
assumed). It wasn't that I looked 
bad, but something was wrong. It was 
only when I noticed a decided 
improvement after I'd eaten off some 
lipstick that 1 realized what bothered 
me about my reflexion. 

It wasn't my face! 

I wiped off the rest of my glossed 
Hollywood mouth and washed off the 
five layers of makeup (fortunately I 
had refused the fixit). Never had my 
own makeupless face looked so good 



:. I had 



model's look c 
accepted it because to reject 
this "personalized makeup" would 
have meant rejecting my own face. I 
had even accepted the obvious racism 
that denigrates the olive complexions 
of Mediterranean peoples as "sal- 
low," Or that labels the features of 98 
per cent of the population as flawed. 
I relate this experience because I 
consider it archetypal. The beauty 
mongers, from the little Mr. Freddies 
to the giant cosmetics tycoons all 
operate the same way. They celebrate 
beauty while simultaneously creating 
fairytale standards of same. Women, 
instead of living happily ever after, 
are more likely to end up with 
wrecked psyches and empty pocket- 
books. 



to an aggressive sales manager 
whose name is Fred, and we've been 
blessed with two little boys, Freddie 
and Carlin. 

The following article is the first in 
a series of articles that I will be 
writing. I hope to share with you my 
views and experiences as a black 
woman, wife, and mother. 

Freddie, my five-year-old, asks 
often, "Mommy, what will I be when I 
grow up?" How do you tell a child 
there is no easy answer to such a 
complex question? Still, I must take 
time to wonder. I know what I want 
for my children, but is it possible for 
the dreams and hopes of a mother to 

I want my sons to be educated, 
college, of course. But more than 
scholastic education, I want them to 
be aware of themselves and their 
heritage. I want them to experience 
pain so that they can understand the 
sufferings of generations of black 
people and their greatness for 
enduring that suffering. 

I want my sons to be proud, proud 
of their blackness. I want them to be 
men, men strong and masculine. 
When I say masculine, I do not refer 
to physical strength, but rather a 
sense of maleness, not feeling 
threatened by women who are more

other races. I want them to be warm 
and loving, to be able to give of 
themselves and not feel self-conscious 
about it. I want them to respect 
others, young and old, black and 
white, rich and poor, simply on the 
basis that these people are human and 
equal to themselves. 

I pray that my sons shall reach 
their manhood in a world where there 
is no separation of races. I want these 
men to know and love people b ecause 
they themselves are known and loved. 
I want them to see a world where they 
can do and become anything they 
have the capabilities for. I want them 
to be proud and accepted by the world 
on the merits of what they as fellow 
humans can contribute to society. 

In the years ahead I shall try to 
guide them. I shall try to prepare 
them for the future. I want to instill in 
them respect for others and them- 
selves. Whatever you do my sons, I 
shall love you. I shall do my best to 
give you the support and strength that 
you need now and always. The things 
I want for you may never be, but there 
are three things you may count on: 

You will be black. 
You will be men. 
You will be loved!

Chet Phyffer agreed with him 
"You should have quality black

directed to the cultural and educa- 
tional problems of the blacks." 

"To me," said James MacDon- 
ald, "busing is a one way proposition: 
busing black people out of their 
territory." And he takes his family for 
example. His sister has to get up at 6 
a.m. every morning just to make the 
school five miles away from their 



Smith Street home. James 1 brother 
can't practice basketball since he 
can't find transportation home after 
practice. 

"Black students going to pre- 
dominantly white schools, they are 
still separated in the cafeteria," 
remarked James' friend. Instead of 
spending more money (on white 
schools) they should hire black 
teachers and if necessary assist them 
with black parents. If you have 90 per 
cent black students, you should have 
at least a 75 per cent black staff," he 
must be a 
i the inner 
city want to bus their children out 
there, you know, fine, but have 
facilities for parents who don't want 
to bus their kids out there!" 

"I was caught up in this busing 
thing," recalled Cheryl Williams 
"and to me personally it does not 
work. I was bused to Elmhurst High. 
But all it was was a token integration. 
You don't want to be there and you 
know that you are unwanted. And the 
psychological effect that it has on lot 
of black students: they lose a lot of 



their identity and culture. When you 
are bused, there is no kind of 
closeness, no type of togetherness and 
you need it. Just the fact that you are 
sitting next to a white persons doesn't 
mean anything." 



"The s

city," said Philip Love. "The 1 

community does not have any control I 

over the situation." Philip advocates ■ 

busing for a few more years, until the j

better facilities constructed. ; 

"Busing is the most effective I

situation," commented Famious I 

Williams, who likes to call himself an ■;

"The Bat" Jenkins, 



behind the consecutive World Champion Oakland Athletics, 
win or lose, Charlie Finley or Charlie Finiey. Why, you folks 
stuck with the A's when they were winning all those 
pennants and drawing all those people in Kansas City back 
in those glory days of the early sixties. Remember? Sure 
you don't! 

(from an impeachable source) has it that 
Dennis Dale McClain has reganed that zing in his fastball 
that garnered him 30 wins several years back. Catch him in 
Birmingham where he has vowed to cut down on that 1973 
8.43 earned run average. He'll befacing some tough 
Southern League swingers, both in the bar and on the 
field. 

Ferguson Jenkins, on the other hand, will be hurling 
bats and baseballs for the Texas Rangers &lt; another 
Southern League entry) this season. His manager will be 
Billy Martin, who must mold a winner under an owner (Bob 
"Senator" Short) who knows nothing about how to own. 

AMERICAN LEAGUE WEST 

1. Oakland Athletics-The A's are lacking in only one 
department-love for Charlie Finley. It's hard to find a 
great winner who is also colorful and exciting at the same 
time, but the A's fit the bill. Some consider Catfish Hunter, 
Ken Holtzman, and Vida Blue to be the top three hurlers in 
MVP Reggie Jackson leads i 



behind Oakland. 

2. Kansas City Royals-Would need great years out of all 25 
players to mount a challenge on the Athletics. Pitching is 
highly questionable with 20-game winner Paul Splittorff and 
sophomore Steve Busby the only hurlers assured of a spot in 
the starting rotation. 

3. Chicago White Sox-Have a better-than-average 
batting attack with Dick Allen, Bill Melton, Ron Santo, 
Carlos May and Ken Henderson leading the way, but the 
pitching will decidethe 1974 fate of the South Side Sox. Last 
year, Wilber Wood (24-20) and mediocre Stan Bahnsen 
(16-20) were grossly overworked and wilj need more help 
this season if the Sox are to threaten anybody. But where is 
the help? 

4. California Angeis-Ask for the names of two Angel 
pitchers and you will get Nolan Ryan and Bill Singer. Ask 
for the name'of one offensive player and you will get Frank 
Robinson. Ask for the names of any other angels and your'e 
out in the cola. 

5. Minnesota Twins-1973 batting champion Rod Carew is 
still around, as is Harmon Killebrew, Tony Oliva and 
newcomer Randy Hundley. The latter three are big 
question marks as are the rest of the Twin offense. Bert 
Blyleven and Dick Woodson are excellent starters, but it 
takes more than two pitchers to go anywhere. 

6. Texas Rangers-Last year owner Bob Short demanded 
that David Clyde pitch in the big leagues just weeks after he 
graduated from high school. If Clyde ruins his career this 
year in the majors, Short should be hung. As for the rest of 
the Rangers, what can one say? 

AMERICAN LEAGUE EAST 

1. Boston Red Sox-The Bosox have an excellent nucleus 
in pitching with Luis Tiant, Reggie Qeveland, Rick Wise, 
Roger Moret, and Bill Lee, the material. Yaz, Rico and 
Carleton Fisk III head the offense with one outfield spot 



Mike Cuellar may all be better than Hunter, Blue, and 
Holtzman of the A's. But with Boog Powell a huge 
disappointment in 1973, the offense noticeably lacks the big 
bats to break up enough games. 

3. Milwaukee Brewers-A productive farm system has 
converted the Brewers into a definite first-division team, 
but the pitching matches up poorly with Boston and the 
Birds. Dave May and George Scott are offensive gems, 
while 20-game winner Jim Colborn is the staff ace. 

4. Newyork Yankees-Murcer and Munson are the only 
swingers worth mentioning, while the pitching lacks that 
crucial fourth starter to back up Mel Stottlemyre, Doc 
Medich and Fritz Peterson. 

5. Detroit Tigers-Old troopers A] Kaline, Norm Cash, 
Jim Northrup and Company always seem to make the game 
somewhat interesting, but certainly not of pennant 
potential. Starters Joe Coleman and Mickey Lolich are 
backed up by no one but ace reliever, John Miller. 

6. Cleveland Indians-And they even tried to trade away 
their only star and box office attraction, Mr. Spitball. 

NATIONAL LEAGUE WEST 

1. Cincinnati Reds-Johnny Bench, MVP Pete Rose, Tony 
Perez and Joe Morgan lead the potent offense with pitching 
appearing solid with 19-game winner Jack Billingham, Don 
Gullett (a sure bet to win 20), Freddy Norman, and Clay 
Kirby. 

2. Houston Astros-Will jell this year under popular 
Preston Gomez and a strong comeback by starter Larry 
Dierker. 

3. Los Angeles Dodgers-Need solid fourth starter and 
top years from youngsters to threaten Reds and Astros. 

4. San Francisco Giants-A strong year by Dave 
Kingman is the key. Bobby Bonds and Ron Bryant give the 
few fans that show up at Candlestick Park their money's
