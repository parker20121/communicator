Fashion Statements for Winter 

Men 



B) SEBASTIAN CHAPMAN 

Staff Wriler 

This season in men's fashions, the 
well-dressed man should deTmilely 
have something paisley in his ward- 
robe. Pants, shirts, sweaters, or ties. 
"You name it, if it's paisley, it 
sells," reported employees at seven 
of nine clothing stores surveyed. 

Men's fashions are generally 
more colorful and non-traditional 
than in the past. Lighter, more lively 
colors have replaced the usual 
fall/winter neutrals, said Tcrri 
Carpenter, a manager at Merry-Go- 
Round, Glenbrook Square. 

Carpenter's store recently re- 
ceived more than its share of 
patronage from rock music fans. 
"Vince Neil, the lead singer for 
Foreigner, came into the store the 
day of their concert in Fort Wayne 
and bought our I.O.U. white mid- 
length jacket. Ever since then, we 
can't keep enough of them in 
slock," she explained. Although the 
jacket has received some attention, 
it's still not close to being their top 
selling item. 

Heading the list of "hot" items at 
Merry-Go-Round is the "Miami 

Women — 

By M. KATHLEEN GREVEN 

Features Editor 

When you stuff your fall ward- 
robe into boxes to store in the attic, 
keep some ivory and pastel 
garmenls out, because you'll be 
wearing ihem all winter. 

Gone are the days when women 
were restricted to burgundy, loden 
green and navy as the staples of 
their winter wardrobes. This season, 
we'll be awash in mint, rose, magen- 
ta and blues balanced with ivory. 

Some e)(citing proportions, such 
as stirrup pants, take a foothold this 
year, too. Outerwear has lost the 
bulky, "Michellin man look" of 
several years ago. Topcoats are cut 
in a less boxy fashion and now ac- 
tually flatter a woman's figure in- 
stead of hiding it in a coat tailored 
for a man. 

Feel like mixing patterns? If there 
ever was a lime to experiment, it's 
now. Pick up any fashion magazine 
and study the scale of the patterns 
and colors that have been combin- 
ed. If you lay the ensemble out on 
the floor, as one magazine article 
recommended, and no single pattern 
jumps out at you — wear it! 

Sales people at the Limited, in 
Glenbrook Square, are proficient at 
helping customers find the most 
flattering styles and colors. They 
lake into consideration the figure, 
lifestyle and coloring of the in- 
dividual in making fmal sugges- 
tions. When you walk through their 
door, be open lo the unexpected. 

Pilch your notions about sweat- 
shirts being boring, solid colors 
relegated only to the gym or early 
morning classes. The Limited has 
sweatshirts that will spiff up even 
the most boring outfit! Thai's a real 
bonus to those of us who wish to 
present ihe illusion that we at least 
made an effort to look good - - 
-these tops make it look so easy! 

Cabbage roses, in full bloom, 
grace this new breed of sweatshirt. 
Dusty rose and blues make this top 
perfect for jeans, or a white bjouse 



Vice" jacket, Pleated pants, 
anything plaid or paisley, and 
double breasted jackets are also 
popular there, while Nobbson's for 
Men isn't sure which fashions will 
set trends this season. 

"Guys aren't afraid to mix colors 
anymore. Even older gentlemen are 
buying the more aggressive 
patterns," said Rick Tindall, a 
Nobbson's employee. The fiber of 
clothing is what men are paying at- 
tention to. "They're looking for the 
most durable quality on the 
market," he added. 

Genera, Polo, and Guess are just 
a few of Ihe popular jeans. This 
season, two-tone is the most 
popular style of blue jeans. An over- 
sized sweater with a polo shirt 
underneath makes the outfit com- 
plete, suggested Pat Mclaughlin, a 
Bachrach's salesman, who also 
reported sweatshirts are once again 
popular. "You can take '5 sweal- 
shirl and put some kind of print on 
it and then sell it for $25," he said. 
Distressed denim and the cuffed 
baggy look are also popular styles. 

Even ihough while has been con- 
.sidercd a summer color, it can be 



worn during any season, said R,V. 
Hudson, salesman/model for Hud- 
son's. "White is fine for winter as 
long as you incorporate the entire 
outfit," Hudson said. Fort Wayne 
is conservative when it comes to 
fashion. He would like to see the 
older generation try some of the 
newer styles. "You can wear a tradi- 
tional suit and dress it up to look 
like something new. That's one of 
the changes I'd like to see. 

At Hudson's, paisley is a popular 
item. Their paisley yellow tie is a big 
seller. If you've noticed, almost 
every businessman owns one. 

"Basically, anything goes," said 
Larry Burch, also a Hudson's 
salesman. "A plaid sporlscoat with 
a striped shirt and paisley lie is fine. 
Or a plaid coai, plaid shirt, with a 
paisley tie are also coordinates," 
Burch said. He also mentioned nar- 
row ties are still popular, although 
Ihey arc beginning to widen. 

This season's fashions have 
everyone wondering what's next. 
Prints with plaids and plaids on 
paisley? If you think it sounds 
crazy, you should sec how it looks! 



and skirt why not dress up for 

classes once in a while, now that it 
can be so easy? 

Sheryl Gowrylok, manager of the 
Limited, said Ihai they don'l even 
have to sell these new looks to iheir 
customers, because, "when ihey 
(customers) come in, Ihey know 
what they want, and they come here 
to build OHIO Iheir wardrobe." 

Building onto an existing ward- 
robe is easy ai (he Limited because 
Forenza, Kenzo and Hunter's Run, 
the major groups Ihe store features, 
color key their collections to make 
an infinite number of combinaiions 
possible. 

The staff will help you with the 
mixing of stripes, plaids, paiterns 
and paisleys in some very discreet 
ways. One outfit displayed on Ihe 
wall was made up of three patterns, 
but it only became obvious when 
Gowrylok dissected it into in- 
dividual garments. 

Oversized sweaters are now 
available in crew neck, V neck, car- 
digan and a cropped version of 
each. 

"This shorter sweater," said 
Gowrylok, "is especially good for 
the woman whose figure can't carry 
the bulkiness of the larger 
versions." 

Feel free to experiment with long 
and short skirts and stirrup pants 
with different styles of blouses, 
sweaters, blazers and other 
outerwear. But whatever you do, 
don't leave until you have checked 
out Ihe new socks! They perform 
magic in unifying any outfit. 

Right next door, but fashion 
worlds away. Nobbson's caters to 
an entirely different clienlelle. 

Nancy Stuck, manager, said that 
her customers lean toward the Iradi- 
tional. Nobbson's carries the 
tailored crew neck and V neck 
sweaters for women who wish to 
present a more subdued silhouette. 

Popular motifs include 
snowflakes, ducks, sheep, cows, 
reindeer and lartan plaids. These arc 



paired with simple cut skirls, 
blouses and clacks, ofien made 
from luxury fabrics, 

Nobbson's is one of the few stores 
in lown where you can still buy a 
silk dress or blouse at a reasonable 
price, plus receive help accessorizing 
Ihe outfit - a far cry from most 
department stores where "you're on 
your own." 

"Most of our customers come in 
to buy an entire outfit. We help 
ihem put together pieces that will be 
very fiexible and work wilh what 
ihey already own," said Stuck. 

This personal service is what has 
made Nobbson's the largest Fort 
Wayne owned and operated 
clothing store. It's obvious thai 
customers are leaving saiisfied, 
because they keep returning with 
their disposable income in exchange 
for "thai Nobbson look." 

The mood of the store is serious 
and business oriented. The silhouet- 
les of the clothing are no-nonsense, 
wilh the focus often in the materials 
used - - -not on a trendy cut or col- 
or. Stuck indicaied that her 
customers are interested in a ward- 
robe in which Ihey will look as 
fashionable today as they will a year 
from today, and have come to ex- 
pect this stability from Nobbson's, 

If you're not sure what your style 
is. you may want lo make your first 
slop a department store, such as 
Hudson's, one of the anchor stores 
at Glenbrook. 

One corner is bursting with cozy 
and colorful sweaters, across the ai- 
sle are racks of blouses lo shp on 
underneath and panis of every 
description are around Ihe corner. 

Oversize, bright, tailored, demure 
or romantic clothing are available 
within Ihe confines of one store. 

Once you've decided upon a style, 
have some fun by trying on 
everyihing in sight. The salespeople 
in clothing stores secretly pray for 
one such customer daily -isn't their 
mission in life to pick up afier us?

This winter's temperatures may read below 
zero, but the fashion forecast will read warm 
pink, light blue, and sunny yellow, all in an array 
of bright patterns. 

"People are more color conscious now, 
wearing colors that look best for them year 
round," said Linda Gibson, manager of Nobb- 
son's, Glenbrook Square. 

Knit clothing and fake fur cuddle coats in 
pastels are some of Uie seasonal garments which 
will be popular this year. "Winter coats will be 
featured in light blue, pink, and even yellow," 
said Gibson. 

"Expect to see winter suits for women in off- 
white and pink. Bright colors are still in, but 
accessories will be light violet, green, and 
orange," she commented, 

"Bright jewel tones like royal blue, deep red, 
and yellow are in this year, and also the military 
look in red, white and mavy," noted Mary 
Smolitch, manager of Gantos in Glenbrook 
Square. 

The long blazer with tl-ie longer skirt in deep 
rich purple and royal blue is another new item 
according to Smolitch, "There will be a little 
more fashion in dressing for success," she ad- 
ded. 

Sports wear and casual clothes are also in new 
colors this season. 

"Denims will l&gt;e seen in plaids, paisley, black, 
red, green, and cobalt blue," said Jill Marquart, 
special events coordinator for Hudson's, 
Glenbrook Square. 

"Patterns will be popular this winter; patterns 
on top of patterns, paisley print earrings, ttelts, 
and necklaces." she commented, continuing, 
"muted dark colors like evergreen, brown, and 
maroon, and lots of black accessories, are 
popular And sunglasses of all colors ivill be worn 
yearround." 

So no matter what your color may be, 
remember, the forecast reads, "Do Your Own 
Thing,"

Children's Fashion Update 



"Children are

clothing and 

more soft fabrics

Intense colors, comfortable clothing 
and soft fabrics hit the target for kids

THE FASHION ADVENTURE 



Bj EARL SMITH 

Chief ReporUr 

"Colore and accessories 

will be the highlight of 
fashion this fall and winter," 
said SheriJI Raudenbush, 
owner of Thursday's Child. 
Intense colors, such as hot 
pink, and contrasting colors, 
such as pink and grey and 
red and black, will be 
popular, says Raudenbush. 
Accessories are becoming 
quite popular with 

elementary school children 
as well as older children. The 
"in thing" for both boys and 
girls this fall is the plastic 
bright I sometimes 
flourescenti colored charms. 
"The boys w^ar (hem on 
their pants' bell loops and 
the girls wear Ihem on 



bracelets or necklaces," said 
Jones. "There are lennis 
racquets, fruits, animals and 
trees." 

"The kids lake Ihem lo 
school and trade them," 
Raudenbush comments. 
Plastic Cham necklaces and 
bracelets are also hot items, 
she added. 

"Children are wearing 
more comfortable clothing 
and more soft fabrics such as 
jogging suits, fleeces and 
velours," says Evelyn Jones, 
manager of Smith's Six- 
pence. For instance jogging 
suits are now available in all 
sizes starling with infants, 
says Jones. 

Both Jones and Rauden- 
bush have noted an increase 



in the amount of collon 
fabric clothing sold. "Five 
years ago I could not sell 
cotlon bul now it's one of (he 
more popular fabrics," says 
Raudenbush. 

Children's styles are 
reflecting adult styles, 
Raudenbush points out. 
"What is fashionable for 
women and juniors fillers 
down to children's styles in 
two years," says Rauden- 
bush. .', 

Corduroy is becomii 
more popular, says Jones. 
"Our biggest selling outfit 
for elementary school boys is 
a button-down shirt, sweater 
and corduroy pants," says 
Jones. 

For girls, stirrup pants are 



increasing in popularity, 
says Etaudenbush, Cropped 
panls were by far the most 
papular last spring but have 
declined significantly, says 
Raudenbush. Both feel girls' 
.eaters and vests 



will be big selling items this 
winler. 

What is the future fashion 
trend? There seems lo t&gt;e a 
movement on both coasts 
back lo traditional styles and 
colors, says Raudenbush

Keeping warm in winter... 

Leather, fur styles reflect practicality 




By GARY LACY 

Staff Writer 
The (all weather is quickly 
approaching, and the time 
has come again to invest in a 
new coat before the blustery 
winds of the north invade 
that old weathered and worn 
jacket. Before purchasing 
the coat, checking up on the 
latest trends could be 
beneficial in making the buy 
a smart one 

Berman's Leather at 
Glenbrook Mall is currently 
selling many men's and 
women's fur and leather 
jackets According to Kurt 
Swank, manager at the 
Glenbrook location, smooth 
finish on leather is more 
popular than suede since it is 
easier (o maintain and store. 
The wool coats thai Ber- 
man's sell, however, have 
dropped in popularity, 
mainly because the 
customers at their store are 
looking for furs this year. 

Jane Winn, buyer for 
Roots Camp and Ski, said ski 
jackets are still a big buy at 



theirslore. "Even the people 
who don'l ski want to look 
like they do, " staled Winn, 
"and this increases the sale 
of ski jackets by both skiers 
and other customers." Roots 
has also had steady sales on 
powder jackets, but down 
jackets "are going out" 
according to Winn. 

J C Penney's at Glen- 
brook Square has also had 
good sales in leather jackets, 
but those customers on a 
fixed budget find the nylon 
jackets the best buy. The 
nylon jackets are in a price 
range from S8S to JlOO. and 
the leather jackets are 
priced near S150. Wool has 
done considerably well at 
J.C, Penney's, but leather is 
still the most popular choice. 

Preparation for the up- 
coming winter season can be 
a little more pleasant with a 
new warm coat. The latest 
styles can be determined 
through the purchases 
customers make. A new coat 
can be a beneficial device (or 
the chilling months ahead. 



Professional looking as Ibey may be, Dave and Brad are also being practical for those cold 
winter days. Dave is kept from the cold in his khaki overcoat. Brad is wearing a herringbone 
topcoat from Nobbsoii's. iPholo by Chris Wesner). 

Larger styles are bright and abstract 




**Larger women will be 
wearing much of the same 
thing as smaller women. Mer- 
chandisers have caught on to 
the fact that basically all 
women can wear a lot of the 
same styles,"

Larger size women won't 
be left out in the cold this 
winter. The fashion forecast 
for large style clothing will 
be, "bright colors and ab- 
stract and paisley prints." 
according to Laurie ~

said Romer 

"Bracelets, necklaces and

statement for fall and winter

after are comfortable. 
reasonable In price, have a 
good quality design and fit 
personal needs. 

In Fori Wayne, retailers 
have found the major 
customer need is comfort at 
a reasonable price. Most 
shoe designers are now 
producing footwear with just 
the right emphasis on 
comfort. 

Attractive casual styles 
for men and women are 
available in soft leather with 
a cushioned insole and 
rubber sole. This rubber sole 
is designed specifically to 
alleviate any stress caused 
by walking or standing (or 
long periods of lime, par- 
ticularly appreciated when 
rushing to one more class. 

Business wear for men and 
women remains traditional 
in color and style. Men are 
choosing slip-ons, wing tips 
or, for a designer look, they 
may purchase the Italian 
made Bruno Magli. iBruno 
Magli can be found at Hide 
Park in Glenbrook Square.) 

The popular colors for men 
and women are classic grays 
and blacks that are easy to 
co-ordinate with your 
existing wardrobe. Women 
are purchasing a basic low 
heeled pump for thai "dress 
(or success" look. 

Prices m the Fort Wayne 
area cover a wide range. Al

the price variance is be-

Shoes, a classic men's shoe 
store in Glenbrook, has a 
price range of S30-S135, 
TrendseKers, Hide Park and 
Wild Pair, in Glenbrook 
Square have price ranges 
between i22-Sl60. 

The more expensive shoes 
are designer labels such as 
Evan Picone, Garolini, 
Bandalino and Bernardo. 

Accessories and hosiery 
are enjoying a "comeback" 
in 1985. According to Cindy 
Goedesky, manager of 
Naturalizer, the classic look 
is coming back. She at- 
tributes the resurgence of 
this accessorized look to 
Nancy Reagan and Pnncess 
Diana.

not only dressing for style, 
but also to invest in Ibeir 

Popular looks include

the footwear. 

When choosing shoes, 
hosiery and accessories, the 
most important things to 
keep in mind are your in- 
dividual tastes and needs. 

Before embarking on that 
shopping trip, analyze the 
way you dress and the 
purpose the footwear will 
fulfill.

criteria, Ihe experience will 
be much less confusing and 
you'll be happier with your

Makeovers create new look 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 

Sports Editor 
Many people are searching 
for a "ne^v look, " as shown 
on bilk shows, such as "Hour 
Magazine." as well as in 
magazines. Two IPFW 
students who have 
discovered a new look are 
Michele Shaffer and Andy 
Overmeyer. Both Michele 
and Andy had culs and 
perms as pari of their make- 
overs done at New 
Revelations, a salon in Fort 
Wayne. 

Michele had the op- 
portunity to discuss her new 
hairstyle with her stylist, 
Bob Bartrom. The client and 
hairstylist usually have 
ideas on the preferred cut, 
and will arrive at a suitable 
style together. 

The first step is the 
shampoo. Then, the scissors 
are brought out to start the 



cuttuig process Bob began 
by trimming two inches off 
of the back of Michele's 
brown hair, then proceeded 
to cut 14 inches ol length off 
the top, thus making a 
"layered" affect, 

A Redken perm was then 
applied. Michele's perm has 
plenty of curls, to be worn 
naturally, if desired. Slightly 
stronger than a body wave, 
this perm can give the hair 
more movement, as well as 
more support as it grows out. 

Electrically healed rollers 
are put in last, creating a 
basic style for longer hair, 
not a "trendsetter" style. 

To care for Michele's hair, 
Bob recommended a pH- 
balanced (in the 4.S-5.S 
range) shampoo. This will 
protect and extend the life of 
the perm. 

To maintain the desired 
style, hair should be trim- 
med every four to six weeks. 



This will keep the ends 
strong and to make the perm 
last. Michele should get a 
perm every tour to five 
months, because of the 
length of her hair 

Andy's hair was styled by 
Elaine Lengacher. Andy is in 
the Army Reserve, so he 
wanted a neat "Army-legal" 
cut, keeping the neckline 
above the ears Andy's 
partial perm resulted in a 
tew permanent "curb" in 
the front of his brown hair to 
redirect his hair line, There 
is no curl resulting from the 
perm, just a wave to provide 
movement and versatility. 

Lastly, Michele received a 
makeover from Elaine. 
Using Redken products 
again, a moisturizer was 
applied, to protect her skin 
from environmental 
change:^. iThis can be used 
(or both men and women). 



Next, a waler-I}ase foun- 
dation in a light rose color 
was chosen to even out skin 
tones, after concealing dark 
circles, which are "usually 
hereditary, ' according to 
Elaine. The cheeks are 
done next, Elaine used a 
sponge to apply cherry blush 
to Michele's cheek bones. 

Elaine applied a burgundy 
shadow, with petal (rost pink 
highlighter to emphasize 
Michele's eyes For evening, 
darker color is put on the 
bone right above the eye 
socket Plum grey is placed 
on the crease of the eyes, and 
eye liner is added un- 
derneath. 

Lips receive the last 
treatment. A Hp conditioner 
is used, then a lip liner and 
lipstick in a darker shade of 
plum wine is applied. 



Women go to new lengths for glamour 




Nail sculphjre is becoming 
all the rage in Fort Wayne. 
Although this craze was long 
m reaching us, its 
momentum is building as the 
holidays draw near 

Juanita Jefferson, a local 
nail technician, has also 
worked as a beautician for 
the last ten year^. She's 
currently employed by 
Lillian Unlimited, a salon in 
Washington Square, 

The price for sculptured 
nails varies according to the 
length you desire. Glamour 
length nails, for special 
occasions, are more ex- 
pensive than the length most 
women choose for daily 
wear. 

Sculptured nails are made 
of porcelain or acrylic 
powder resins and a liquid 
chemical. 

The first step is to roughen 
the nail bed slightly, for 
better adhesion of the 
finished nail. Then a nail 
freshner is applied to con- 
dition the area and a nail 
form is placed around the 
finger 

A mixture of the liq[Uid 
chemical and powder resin is 
mixed directly on the form 
and spreads to cover the nail 



These "nails" will dry in 45 
minutes to an hour and 
require a time investment of 
two hours to have an entire 
set applied. 

After the new nails are 
dry, Jefferson files them into 
a shape which flatters the 
client's hands, taking their 
shape and size into con- 
sideration. 

Upkeep is important to the 
sculptured nails About 
every three weeks, a "fill in" 
is required, to compensate 
for the growth of the natural 
nail. 

If the idea of an entire 
"nail" doesn't appeal to you, 
nail tips or wTaps may be 
alternatives to investigate. 

Nail decorations are also 
available at Lillian's. 
Removable nail charms, 
gold nails Iwith or without 
diamonds), and tricolor 
gold nails have all been 
popular. 

There is something tor 
everyone, and it's relatively 
inexpensive to be stylish — 
right down to the tips of your 
fingers.

Gourmet food 

Extravagence, uniqueness new fashion 



By ANCIE FRANCE 
Chief Reporter 

"A irue connoisseur's 
delight" is what Karen 
Uetrecht, owner of the 
Nutcracker Sweet Shoppe, 
calls her handmade tru/lles 
— pure chocolate filled with 
B rich, prntine filling. 

Fashion, il seems, does not 
only apply to clothes. There 
are a lot ol unusual new 
restaurants, groceries and 
delis around the Fort Wayne 
area whose owners know 
people are willing to pay a 



little extra (or that gourmet 
piece de resistance — 
Fashion Food, 

When asked what her 
specialties are, Uetrecht 
replied, "Everything I make 
is special!" Her most 
requested specialties, 
however, are her truffles 
and an extra special dessert- 
type treat called an Apollo. 
chocolate mousse spread 
over cake and dipped in 
chocolate. 

The Nutcracker Sweet 
Shoppe on Garfield Avenue 



caters a "sweet treat" tray 
full o( the "more elite types 
of party foods, served in- 
dividually." Uetrecht has 
catered everything from 
weddings to executive 
management parties. 

The Bill of Fare Specialty 
Foods. Inc., is a "gourmet 
grocery" on North Anthony 
owned by Gus Verslynen. 
"The gourmet grocery is a 
new idea for Fori Wayne," 
said Verslynen. His shop 
carries all kinds o( popular 
pasta salads — very much in

Fashion, it seems, does not apply 
only to clothes. There are a lot of 
unusual new restaurants, 
groceries and delis around the 
Fort Wayne area whose owners 
know people are willing to pay a 
little extra for that gourmet piece 
de resistance — Fashion Food. 



vogue — and faddish foods 
such as sun-dried tomatoes, 
which Verslynen believes 
are only a passing thing. His 
most popular items are 
wholebean coffees (he 
carries 19 flavors) and 85 
different kinds of imported 
cheeses. In fact, most of 
what Bill of Fare carries is 
imported, and cannot be 
found in a regular grocery 
store. Hard-to-find foods, as 
any other hard-lo-find item, 
arc always the most 
fashionable. 

But once they have been 
found, the businesses which 
feature the unusual become 
all the rage. Witness the Blue 
Mountain Coffee Co., a 
coffee shop, restaurant and 
popular live-band en- 
tertainment spot on The 
Landing. Its menu features 
page after page of the lunds 
of snacks and dinners you 
can't find just anywhere. 
One can get a light dinner of 
pizza bagels covered with 
tomato sauce, cheese and 
olives, or any one of many 
different kinds of sand- 
wiches or salads — yes, 
vegetarians, there's even a 
whole page in the menu for 
you — and still have enough 
room for a slice of one of the 
Blue Mountain's popular 
cheesecakes. 

Closer to IPFW on 
Coliseum Boulevard is an 
increasingly popular place 
for lunch, the Subway 
Famous Footlong Sand- 
wiches restaurant. Owner 
Bill Humphries has opened 
fiveslores in the Fort Wayne 
area, but the franchise is 
nation-wide and growing 
fast Subway features fresh 
loaves of bread, baked in the 
store, and stuffed with 
turkey, salami, meatballs — 
just about any kind of meat 
one can think of, including 
seafood and crab — and all 
the "fixin's," lettuce, 
tomatoes, onions, peppers, 
black olives, pickles, cheese 
and salad oil. Since each 
sandwich is made to order, 
one can get double meat, 
extra cheese, or leave off 
any fixin' one doesn't want. 
For the diet-conscious, each 
one of the sandwiches 
available is also available as 
a salad plate. 

Any discussion of 
fashionable food would not 
be complete without men- 
tioning that favorite hang- 
out for Fort Wayne Yuppies, 
The Marketplace of Can- 



terbury. The Garden Mall is 
a recent addition to the 
shopping center. Several 
stores are already open m 
the Garden Mall, but con- 
struction is still in progress 
When completed, it will 
feature a unique grocery 
which will continually carry 
the freshest meat and 
produce available. 

Some of the other 
businesses include The 
Candy Emporium, where 
one can buy fresh fudge 
made on the premises; Le 
Cafe Gourmet, which 
features several varieties of 
pate and 21 different nch, 



Dry cleaning: 

A pressing winter issue 



Cafe la 
I shop 



gourmet desserts; 

featuring he 

cream and cones, and 

Shalimar, an Indian 

restaurant owned by the 

family of an IPFW 

professor. 

Another fashionable place 
to dine in the Marketplace 
outside ol the Garden Mall is 
a little deli called The Bagel 
Station, The Bagel Station 
has many different kinds of 
bagels, of course, and 
several kinds of deli sand- 
wiches made with freshly 
baked bread. They also 
carry flavored cream 
cheeses, and several salads 
such as crabmeat and pasta 
salads. The cheesecakes and 
fresh pastries made at The 
Bagel Station are becoming 
very popular among the non- 
diet-conscious, as well as the 
diet-conscious cheaters. 
After all, if one is going to 
blow his diet, one may as 
well make it worthwhile. 

Of course, downright 
expensive food will always 
be fashionable. Lombard's in 
the new downtown Hilton 
Hotel (named after Carol, of 
course), recently cost a Fort 
Wayne newspaper reporter 
$107 dollars for a dinner for 
two And the simple elegance 
of duJour ("Continental 
Cuisine — Menu Changes 
Daily") is popular for its 
originality. 

As fashion is an inherently 
transient concept, owners of 
the fashionable food 
businesses have to be as 
willing to adapt to changing 
tastes as are the makers of 
clothes. Time will tell which 
of the popular restaurants, 
foodshops and gourmet delis 
will survive in Fort Wayne, 
and which ones will go the 
way of the poodle skirl and 
saddle shoes.

CHAPMAN 
Staff Writer 

Now that you've 
unearthed last year's 
wardrobe and bought new 
winter clothes, you have to 
properly care for Ihem if 
you want them to keep 
looking new. 

To begin with, you should 
never put any garments 
away dirty, especially 
wool. Moths aren't after 
your clothing; they're after 
food or oils found in the 
soiled material of dirty 
clothing. 

Don't worry about 
drycleaning your clothes 
loo frequently. All the 
drycleaner does is remove 
the dirt from them. It 
they're beginning to fade. 
-it's more likely from 



wearing them too often 
rather than dr&gt;'celaning too 
often. 

A deRnitc no-no when 
washing cottons is using 
bleach. Never bleach jeans 
unless the effect Is desired. 
Betty Rider, of Dryclean 
America, advises when 
washing cottons, such as 
jeans. never pour 
detergent directly on the 
material. She recommends 
the dryer not he too hoi. 
Always set the dryer at 
permanent press or the 
equivalent to insure the 
ma teria I doesn' t 
drastically shrink; all 
cottons will shrinit some. 

All coals should be 
drycleaned. The padding 
and insulation, you'll find, 
will last much longer if 



properly cared for. 

Corduroys should be 
drycleaned, but If you 
prefer to wash them, be 
sure to turn them inside- 
out. "The pile fiber works 
agninsl itself this way and 
niLses Uie material, ' said 
Rider. 

Whenever a fabric is 
soiled, it tends to wrinkle. 
This is the first sign 
cleaning is needed, 
especially with fabrics 
which can only be 
drycleaned. You should 
also follow the manufac- 
turer's instructions when 
caring Cor your clothes. If 
they thought you knew how 
to clean the cloUiing, there

As you outfit yourself for 

fall, don't forget fragrance. 
A change to cooler weather

autumn.

manager at Hudson's. The 
fragrance is soft with a truly 
green, herbal fresh scent. 

For the first time since 
1973, Estee Lauder has in- 
troduced a new fragrance. 
"Beautiful," represented in 
advertisements by a 
traditionally clothed bride, is 
a romantic blend of flowers 
and a twist of citrus. 

"Obsession," by Calvin 
Klein, is an often requested 
fragrance at local perfume 
counters, it is a rather soft 
scent with a wood note. 

Some women like to ex- 
periment and will change 
their fragrance as often as 
they change their clothes. 
Others pick one favorite 
scent and stay with it. A 
traditional favorite with 
customers at J. C. Penney's 
is "Vanderbilt-" It's the 
number one seller, says 
Joyce Marano, assistant 
merchandiser. "Vanderbilt" 
is a sweet, light scent which 
has been around for a while. 

"Oscar de la Renta." 
■■Chloe" by Lagerfeld, and 
"Opium" by Yves Saint 
Laurent are seasonal 
favorites at Hudson's and L. 
S. Ayers. Each scent is 
popular l)ecause it is unique 
and wiU smell slightly dif- 
ferent on the wearer 

To get the ultimate effect 
from a fragrance, layering is 
recommended by fragrance 
specialists Start in (he 
shower by using a shower gel 
or soap, then after drying 
off. a body lotion may be 
applied, then a dusting with 
powder and finaUy perfume 
or cologne on the body's 
pube points.
