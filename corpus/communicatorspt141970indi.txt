The student Alpha Chapter of 
the Izaak Walton League was 
cstablised late last spring after 
the April 22nd Environmental

thc"toach-in" students, that 
were interested in conservation 
and ecology, went through the 

this the first club of this type 
at the IU-PU Campus. Being 
a new club it only has a mem- 
bership o f fifteen devoted per- 
sons but with a membership

hoped that number will be dou- 
bled and even tripled. 

The intention of the Alpha

DO SOMETHING 



COMMUNICATOR 



This Semester ! 



by : Mike Schnclker 



Make your college life more enjoyable! Don't just rush 
home after your classes are over for the day! Why not stick 
around school for a couple of minutes or nights and join a 
club- You'll meet n ew friends and learn new things while hav- 
ing a good time doing what you like. All of college life isn't 
just studying: part of your education comes from meeting now 
people and learning things that can't be taught in the class- 
room. Some of the special interest clubs on campus are 
the Radio Club, Bridge Club, Chess Club, and Camera 
Club. If you're interested in joining any of these clubs, go to 
Room 103 (off of the Student Lounge) and ask about the club 
that interests you. You will be given the name, address, and 
phone number of the president of the club. Then all you have 
to do is get in touch with the president or the club to" find ou! 
all of the details of that club. If you find in impossible to 
get in touch with the president, then write a briof note ox- 
plaining your desire to join a club, including your name, ad- 
dress and phone number and drop it into appropriate Student 
Organization mailbox. These mailboxes are located in the 
Student Lounge, outside of the office of Student Services. 
There arc several service organizations on the Campus; 
these include the Circle K and the Alpha. Phi Omega.. The 
Circle K operates the coal room. Both organizations are ded- 
icated to the betterment of (he campus of the surrounding coir 
munity. But it isn't all work and no play. These clubs have 
social activities as well as service activities. 

IU-PU at Fort Wayne also has many Departmental Organ - 
izalionnl groups. These include the Geology Club, Math Club, 
Russian Club, German Club, Ag Club, American Chemical Soc- 
iety, and others. To join these clubs, just go to Room 103 
and see Mr. Jim Bolinger. 

If something interests you and there isn't a dub formed 
then lorm it yourself. Maybe there nre other people interested 
in the same thing. For information on starting a club, go to 
Room 103 and sec Mr. Jim Bolinger. 

Most faculty advisors, urge students to join some organ- 
ization. They feel that it is good for students to join clubs, 
but they urge students not to join so many clubs that they for- 
get the real reason whv l.hev are hero; 

THAT'S TO GET AN EDUCATION.

Free Parking - 

YOU'LL PAY FOR IT ! 

September 8,1970 

H'lterrns I oiii a poverty stricken student with a husband and 
two (2) children, and am unending the IU - PU Regional Campus 
on an Unii'frsily Merit Scholarship (Purdue) ourl an N.S.D.L. Loi 
and cannot afford to buy a permit to park Hear Hie building of Hie cam 
pus. I desire lo park in (he free lot across the river. 

I find (hat it is necessary (o park on the grass as the space is 
insufficient in the (ree lot. also that my shoes are wet from the gross 
and I anticipate that I will have wetter shoes ftom the snow lhal 
usually foils hi Indiana each year. I find that my person is in phy- 
sical danger ftom the hazard of walking in the road as no sidewalks 
are provided from Anthony Blvd. to the campus buildings. 

Also (he physical donger encountered includes asphiijation 
and deafness from hiking across Johnny Applcseed Bridge becausi 
of the traffic ou the U.S. 30 Bypass. 

Also I am in great fear of robbery, rape, or mugging by having 
to walk lo the free lot each evening at 6:00 p.m.. 

I find the situation intolerable and request these dangers be 
alleviated as Ihe present facilities wok severe hardship on me.

The Indiana Students 
Association, Inc. recently 
contracted an Indianapolis 
advertising agency to pro- 
duce a thirty minute color 
film. The film, which is ex- 
pected to cost $5,ooo, will 
deal with the problems of the 
average college student on 
the campuses of Indiana col- 
leges and universities. 

The film lias a dual pur- 
pose according to Mike Nus- 
baumer,one of the two student 
representatives of the ISA at 
the Fort Wayne campus. The 
film will be used as a lobbying 
effort against the state govern- 
ment in Indianapolis repre- 
senting all the college stu- 
dent-- in Indiana. Tin' ISA 
hopes to ward off a possible 
tuition increase through the 
lobbying effort. The film's 
second purpose will be to 
try to give the citizens of In- 
diana an idea of what the 
life is like of the average 
college student. In Nus- 
baumer's words the film will 
try to "sell college stu- 
dents." 

Nusbaumer said that film 
crews would be shooting some 
footage on the Fort Wayne cam- 



pus. Possible targets of the 
cameois might be the trams 
and the lack of adequate study 
space. Filming will also take 
place on, the Indianapolis and 
Lafayette campuses as well 
as the campuses of sixteen 
other colleges and universi- 
ties throughout the state. 

After final ISA editing and 
approval, the film isill be made 

sis. An Indianapolis television 
station has already agreed to 
show the film according to 
Frank Akey, ISA representa- 
tive at the Fort Wayne Campus. 
He added that negotiations arc 
progress with stations 
throughout the stale to enable 
everyone an opportunity to view 
the film. Akey said that copies 
of the film may be made avail- 

of about one hundred 
dollars each. 

The ISA is a stale widi

students by promoting commu'

NEW DEAN 



SOON? 



In December of I960 Dunn 
Smith of Purdue's l-ort fluync 
Campus was released. ,\ Copl- 
and two studenlswas appointed 
to make feccomendations for 
Dean Smith's successor. 

The four appointed faculty 
members are Dr. Mavnard Mans- 
field (chairman) of' the Mathe- 
matics Department; Mr. Charles 
Creasser of the Industrial Su- 
pervision Department; Mr. John 
Johnson or the Engineering 
Department; and Mr. Turner. 
.Mr. Turner, ihouish. left the 
university at the end of the 
1969-1970 school year- The stu- 
dent members arc unrlrrgrtidu- 
ate Frank Akev and graduate 
student Maurice Emery. 

The committee started to 
work in January of 1970 and 
completed ,hcir work with iheir 
last meeting. July 17. 1970' 



■ i of n 



At that point the 
milled thai 
olions. but they all have de- 
clined. They were either too 
busy lo accept or were leaving 
the university. 

One can only speculate 
about what will happen next. 
in the search Tor a new dean. 
It is possible thai a new dean 
will be found without the com- 
mittee having to meet again. If 
they do meet again, however, 
il will probably lake some lime 
to select a replacement for Mr. 
Turner. Since some of the sel- 
ections hove turned down ihe 
the offer, il is probable that the 
committee will meet again al- 
though no meeting has been sch- 
eduled as of now. 

'l appears ihat the sel- 
ection is at a standstill.
