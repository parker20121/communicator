French involvement in Vietnam 
raises questions among veterans 



BUM Writer 

Over 75 veterans, retugees an 
sludenls came to IPFW Oct. 4 to viei 
and discuss the first pari of "Vietnam 
A Television History.'' a IJ-parl PB 
documentary. 

Gilford ScolL associate professor c 
history, said the majority of people I. 



The first program discussed French 
appropriation of Indochina in I860 and 
Vietnamese resistance The rise ol Ho 
Chi Minh as a nationalist leader was 
also Included. 

Louis Cantor, who co-hasli the 
discissions with Scott, said the viewing 
and discussion was funded by a grant 
from the Indiana Committee for the 
Humanities. 

Rick Ritler, a Vet Center counselor, 
said the material in Ihe program was 
accurately presented, but failed to 
point out President Franklin D 
Roosevelt wonted Indochina a&gt; on 
American "property." 

Dan Nguyen, a Vietnamese refugee, 
said the documentary didn't show other 
nationalist leaden — only Ho Chi Mlnh. 
Ho was oat the only nationalist lender, 
Nguyen said, and Ho was not 
recognized as a Comi .unisl until 1045. 
He also said Ho used the French lo kill 
of! Vietnamese nationalists in order to 
strengthen his own position as s 
national leader. 



One veteran said Ihe documenlory 

the war Scott said laler progroms 
might address Ihe issue. 

Another veteran asked if racial 
differences — between Vietnamese and 
Cambodians-contributed to Ihe 
problem A refugee said there were no 
racial problems within Ihe country 

Scott described Ihe final moments 
of the discussion as "dramollc." 
Nguyen thanked all Vietnam veterans 
lar fighting for Vietnam's freedom. One 
veteran said it was the first time he had 
been thanked far what he did. 

The fallowing evening the second 
program played to a slightly smaller 
crowd. The influence of Japan in World 
War II. the defeat ol the French and the 
beginning ol U.S. involvement was 
discussed in the program. The program

Mayor W infield Moses, addressing the Issues of jobs, IPFW, and the police force, 
attended the IP FW Student Sen ate meeting Oct. 4. 

Moses, an IPFW graduate and former student senate member, told the senate

Administration finally 
reaches decision 



When driving through IPFW about 10 
a.m. Monday through Friday, it Is in- 
[cresting to see many new ways students 
park their cars. Some cars have been 
parked under trees while others have 
been parked along the road. It's sur- 
prising a car hasn't been reported on lop 
of Keltler Hall! 

Relief, however, is finally in sight now 
that the 150-Jot gravel extension to lot 10 
should be completed by Monday. The 
extension should have been completed 
three weeks ago. 

Chancellor Joseph P. Giustl and 
Purdue President Steven C Beerlng 
decided to delay construction (o make 
sure the location of the lot would disrupt 
iraffic flow as little as possible. The Fort 
Wayne (Faculty) Senate proposed a 
resotulion calling for construction of a 
lot near the Multi-Purpose Building 
because the lot 10 extension would 
reduce campus aesthetics. 

The intentions of Giusti, Bee ring and 
the Faculty Senate, which were well 
thoughl out, were to make sure IPFW 
didn't make a move it would regret later 
on. A parking lot is a big investment for 
a university, especially at a time when 
enrollments at other universities are 
down There is no question the view 
along the St. Joseph River looks belter 
without a parking lol. 



IPFW"s enrollment, however, is up, 
and the parking situation was declared 
an emergency at Ihe beginning of the 
semester by Frederick R. Ford, vice 
president and treasurer of Purdue 
University. Ford's decision came al the 
right time. When the semester began 
between 200 and 300 cars were parked in 
the grass while all lots were nearly full. 
Although the number of spaces in lot 1 
near the Multi-Purpose Building in- 
creased as the semester progressed, 
many students would still have had a 
limited number of spaces to choose from 
if and when the spaces were filled. 

Last Monday, 340 cars were in Ihe 
grass while 240 spaces were open in lot 1. 
With 240 spaces open. 100 students would 
still be searching for a parking space 
and probably be late to class. 

IPFW was lucky northern Indiana is 
suffering from a drought. If we had been 
hit by a few bad rainstorms during 
morning hours, the appearance of this 
campus wouldn't be pretty. Beautiful 
lawns would become muddy ruts 
because of the cars. Fortunately, the 
most extensive damage was the loss of a 
coffee tree thai someone ran over. 

The time to act was when Ford 
declared an emergency because there
