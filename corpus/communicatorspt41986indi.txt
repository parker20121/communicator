Students line up at the financial aid line in the bursar's office to pay their fees 
and to pick up aid checks. New federal regulations require more double checking 
on student aid applications which have caused a back-up in the processing of 
many students' aid packages (photo by Janet Widdifield). 



Financial aid: 
new regulations 
bring problems 

By FREDERICK M. HARSHMAN 
Staff Writer 

Financial aid packages are taking longer to process this academic year. 

Last year some 3,000 IPFW students drew $5.5 million dollars in financial aid. 
The aid was in the form of loans, grants and jobs. Many of those loans and grants 
were underwritten by the U.S. Department of Education. 

Richard M. Bellows of the IPFW Financial Aid Office said that new and tougher 
guidelines demanded by the government have caused a huge backlog in the 
processing of some financial aid packages. The government insists on double 
checking each aid applicant's declared family income. This has thrown the 
number of processed packages off by 40 percent as compared (o this time last 
year. Applications for Guaranteed Student Loans and Pell Grants are especially 
affected. Bellows said that many students might not receive their aid checks until 
early October. He attributes the delay directly to the increased paperwork 
fostered by the new federal guidelines. 

Bellows said that students can help in the processing by not tying up the financial 
aid office personnel in daily checks of individual student's aid package status. He 
also said that students who will be needing student aid for the 1987-1988 academic 
year should prepare to file a new Financial Aid Form in January, February or 
March of 1987, 

Bellows stressed that the number one cause of delay in disbursing of aid checks 
is the failure of students to meet filing deadlines. 



Blood supply better, not great 



By JOHN Met, ALLEY 
Staff Writer 
— Despite the fact that the area's blood 
emergency, declared Aug. 25 by the 
American Red Cross, has been 
suspended, blood donors are still badly 
needed. According to Cheryl Michel, a 
spokesperson for the Allen-Wells 
Chapter, the blood supply situation is 
looking "better but not great." 

Under normal circumstances, the 
blood supply for the Fort Wayne region 
would stand at approximately 1080 
units; however, at the height of last 
week's emergency, the supply (or the 
area's 56 hospitals was only 308 units. 

Michel believes the reason such a 
drastic shortage appeared this year 
was that, one, usage among area 
hospitals has jumped; two, people 
believe they do not have the time or do 
not realize (he ongoing need; or three, 
simply fear the process itself. 



One fear of many who might donate., 
that of contracting a disease.. 



-CHERYL MICHEL 
RED CROSS SPOKESPERSON 
ALLEN-WELLS CHAPTER 



After the announcement of the 

emergency was made, donations at the 
Fort Wayne Regional center on 
California Road jumped from around 
500 a week to over 2830 by last Thursday 
afternoon. 

While still badly needing all blood 
types, Michel stated supplies of B-, AB-, 
and O- were becoming critically low. 

The process of donating blood, while 
taking upwards of one hour in total, is 
very simple and involves only eight to 
ten minutes actually giving blood. All 



donors begin the process by filling out a 
short medical history on themselves. 
Next, a trained volunteer nurse draws a 
small sample of blood from the donor's 
earlobe to check the level of 
hemoglobin. 

Age and weight will then be checked 
to assure the donor is between 17 and 65 
years old and at least 110 pounds. At 
this point, a small snack is given and a 
number is assigned that will be used to 
track that particular unit of blood 
throughout its usage. Finally, the ac- 
tual drawing of blood is done. Michel 



said this is comparable to only a brief 
pinch and is virtually pain-free after 
that. When the donation is complete, 
the donor is taken to a resting area for 
another small snack and a chance to 
build up energy before going on their 
way. 

One fear of many who might donate, 
aside from the process itself, is that of 
contracting a disease, such as AIDS, 
from the procedure. According to 
Michel, there is "just no way" this can 
happen. All needles are sterile at the 
time of use and are only used once. This 
assures that no donor can spread any 
infection to another. After the donation 
is received, it is tested for numerous 
anti-bodies, including hepatitis and 
AIDS. 

All persons interested in giving "the 
gift of life" are encouraged to call the 
Allen-Wells Chapter of the Red Cross to 
make an appointment. 



Roby named new poli ce chief 

Chief outlines IPFW 
traffic policies 



By LILLIAN R. LYON 

Managing Editor 

Concerned about your safety on the 
IPFW campus? If you are you can take 
your concerns and questions to the new 
IPFW police chief, Stephen E. Roby. 

Roby, a 14-year veteran of the IPFW 
police and safety department, was 
appointed chief effective July 7, 1986. 
His 14 years in the department include 
seven as an officer and seven as a 
sergeant. He holds an associate's 
degree in criminal justice and a 
bachelor's in public administration, 
both from IPFW. In addition, he has 
trained as an emergency medical 
technician (EMT). 

The IPFW police and safety depart- 
ment is made up of seven full-time 
officers, including Roby; three 
dispatcher-clerks and seven part-time 
student patrolmen. 

Full-time officers must have high 
school diplomas, said Roby. Five of the 
officers at IPFW hold college degrees. 
Officers must also be 21 years of age 
and have no felony record. In addition, 
officers must complete the Indiana Law 
Enforcement Training program within 
their first year of employment, con- 
tinued Roby. 

The campus police are responsible 
for more than just writing parking 
tickets, although this is a big part of 
their job. Effective this year are 
several new policies. No longer do 
visitors sign-in at the department of- 
fice. Temporary permits are issued 
instead, according to Roby. Parking in 
the fire lane how results in a $20 fine, up 
from last year's S10 fine. This coincides 
with the city's policy; if the fine is not 



paid within 10 days, it can be doubled. 
Failure to display permits results in a 
£2 fine, down from (5. Also, meter 
parking is reserved for visitors; cars 
with valid permits parked at meters 
will be ticketed. 

But aside from enforcing parking 
regulations, the campus police are 
responsible for other things, such as 
enforcing speed limits with the use of 
radar, and ensuring pedestrian safety, 
explained Roby. The police and safety 
department also monitors the National 
Weather Service radio channel, and 
controls the tornado and fire alarms. 

Officers are trained In emergency 
medical care and can reach the scene of 
an accident faster than an ambulance. 
They also (each safety lessons to 
children at the Day Care Center. 

Roby has several suggestions for 
IPFW students: 

— Report all accidents as soon as 
possible. 

— To avoid traffic bottlenecks, 
parking lots four through eight on the 
east side of campus should exit at 
Stellhom Road or Crescent Avenue. 
Lots nine through 1 1 on the west side of 
campus should exit at Coliseum 
Boulevard. 

— Lots one, two and 12, though fur- 
ther from most buildings, can save one 
time; rather than driving around to find 
a parking space, one could be walking 

p jffvJrK^' ""' aside times to met with 
stuaWnfs: on Wednesdays from 9:30 to 
11 a.m.; Thursdays, 5 to 0:30 p.m.; 
and Fridays 3 : 30 to 5 p.m. Students with 
suggestions or questions for Roby 
shoulds call or stop by the office to 
schedule an appointment.

Changes in Fort menu 
not a big improvement 



Are you hungry? Planning to make a 
date for lunch at IPFW's cafeteria, The 
Fori? I 

If you are looking for variety, a 
balanced meal and an atmosphere that 
at least equals McDonald's, try 
elsewhere. IPFW's cafeteria recently 
changed hands and is now being 
managed by Canteen Corporation. All 
previous businesses have taken a loss in 
operating The Fort. So. in an attempt to 
make a profit off The Fort, the 
management has severely cut back the 
selection of food available and has 
stopped serving breakfast. 

In previous years, one could walk into 
The Fort quite early, possibly 7 a.m., 
and have their choice of french toast, 
eggs and sausage, muffins, cereal, 
breakfast rolls and orange juice, among 
other breakfast particulars. This year, 
breakfast is not served. Revenue that 
could be earned from IPFW students, 
faculty and staff coming to work or 
school early is now going to McDonald's 
when these people stop at fast food 
restaurants for breakfast and coffee. 

In previous years, one could walk into 
The Fort around 11 :30 a.m. or noon, find 
a long line of students and faculty 
waiting to pick and choose among the 
long list of menu choices. Taco salads, 
beef and noodles, macaroni and cheese, 
chicken, a long line of diet foods such as 
cottage cheese and fresh fruit salads, 
were all available to the IPFW 
community last year. Freshly baked 
cookies, yogurt, milk, orange juice and 
grapefruit juice were always available, 
as well. 

Perhaps the problem is that by serving 
all these foods, the company cannot 



make enough money to cover the cost of 
the food. Maybe another problem is that 
the cost of overhead is too much. Once 
the overhead costs are subtracted from 
the revenue as well as the fixed costs, 
there probably is not much left over to 
serve as profit. 

But, does the answer to this problem 
lie in cutting back the variety of food? 
We think not. A more extensive ad 
campaign might make students aware 
that good food is, or at least was, served 
in The Fort. Are too many wages being 
paid out weekly? If we utilized our 
supply of restaurant and supervision 
majors, as well as work study students, 
overhead could be cut. Surely these 
students need work experience and they 
would not have to be paid as much as 
someone with years of experience 
working in The Fort. 

An answer to the whole problem of the 
turnover in food services at IPFW might 
be to contract a fast food chain to 
operate The Fort. At several major 
campuses, chains such as Burger King 
and McDonald's operate the whole 
cafeteria. Certainly these businesses 
would be a safer bet than a company that 
cuts back selection to try to make a 
profit. 

Another question arises. Were any 
students at IPFW polled as to what they 
would like to see in The Fort? Many 
students would be glad to offer their 
opinion about what they would like their 
campus cafeteria to serve in the line of 
lunch service. 

The university has made a change that 
directly affects many students' habits; 
what is the next target?

Tornadoes not a threat 
to safety on campus 



OnTuesday, Aug. 26, Adams County was hit 
with a severe storm and tornado. Russ 
Marshal) ol the National Weather Service 
reports Lbe tornado warning tor Adams 
County was in effect for 30 minutes. In that 
amount of lime, a path of destruction five 
miles long and l-16Lh of a mile wide was 
created 

You may be asking yourself how you would 
know of impending storms and the danger of a 
tornado if you are in class. What warning 
would you have to lake shelter during a 
tornado warning? 

Y6u really have nothing to fear. The 
university police listen to the Emergency 
Weather Station in times of severe Storms. 
Also monitored are the city, county and state 
police channels, in times of impending 
danger the police are on watch for funnel 
clouds. 

Bob Crosby of the university police states if 



a tornado warning is in effect for Allen County 
and one Is said to be heading towards campus, 
or if one is sighted by the campus police, they 
will turn on the sirens at the lop of the 
Classroom-Medical Building. The sirens will 
be similar to those of a volunteer fire 
department, sounding off continual short 
beeps. The siren will continue the entire time 
a funnel cloud is sighted. 

Sergeant Lauren Denhartog, who is in 
charge of all emergency situations on cam- 
pus, stales professors are given an 
emergency policy handbook, but adds there 
should be bulletins posted in all the rooms on 
campus, telling the students where to go for 
shelter during a tornado warning and where 
to exit in ease of fire. 

The next time the weather forecast calls for 
storms and bad winds, you needn't worry. 
The university police will make every at- 
tempt to beep you safe.

^-Letters to the Editors 

Fort menu lacking 



Ail we ask is for a larger 
variety to choose from. After 
all, the fasl food places of 
Coliseum Blvd. and 
Marketplace of Canterbury 
are just as easy lo get to, and 
cheaper, than Walb. 

One last suggestion — this 
college needs to invest in 
remodeling the cafeteria. 



To the Editor; 

Well, IPFW has done it 
again ... approved changes 
without taking students and 
employees into con- 
sideration. This time, the 
cafeteria (The Fort) in Walb 
was the target 

On a recent visit to Walb to The days of "black and Tred" 
eat, we were surprised lo are long gone. If the at- 
find a half-empty serving mosphere were more ap- 
area. When questioning staff pealing, that alone could be 
as lo whether they were open incentive for many lo spend 
for business, we were told free time between classes 
they would no longer be As is, Ihe place is far too 
serving full menus as in the dark and depressing. Gel 
past. The new food service rid of "the cave," 
company was culling back Name withheld 

selections so the cafeteria ^„c , • 

could make a pront for a Cafeteria worsens 

change. To (be Editor: 



It doesn't lake a business 
whiz lo realize that if you 
want to make money, you 
shouldn't cut back your 
inventory to but a few 
selections, Do they really 
think students and staff will 
go all the way to Walb for a 
hamburger or salad? Sand- 
wiches are available in 
Kelller — save yourself the 
walk I 

Where has our breakfast 
menu gone? Where are the 
good, balanced lunches 
students out here for the day 
need? If the reason for the 
cutback was to eliminate the 
company's overhead coats, 
why not hire students like 
other colleges? Why not offer 
real enticement with popular 
selections or daily specials? 
Lines would be forming all 
Ihe way back to Kelller if 
something creative were 
done ... like a "make your 
own sundae bar." 



The situation 
cafeteria gets Worse every 
year. Two years ago the 
prices were high but the food 
was pretty good and the 
breakfast-fruit bar was 
wonderful. Last year, the 
food wasn't as good, the 
prices were still nigh, but at 
least there was an adequate 
selection of sandwiches and 
entrees. This year it Is the 
PITS! The only thing good 
about the cafeteria is that in 
all the transitions, we have 



not lost the lovely women 
who have served us for many 
years. 

Students often cannot 
afford ihe high prices 
charged on this campus, but 
we are a captive audience. 
We are oflen hungry at times 
other than between 10 a.m. 
and 2 p.m. Wc would like to 
have some choice in whal is 
offered for meals. Asking 
that meals and snacks be 
served at a reasonable price, 
during school hours, would 
nol seem too demanding. 

Why is a big food service 
company needed on this 
campus? Why couldn't Ihe 
university operate a small 
bakery-deli with reasonable 
prices so that students, 
faculty and staff could get a 
good meal, when they-want 
one, at a price everyone can 
afford. 

Currently, the university 
needs its cut and the food 
service needs its percentage. 
Where does this leave the 
students? When are we going 
to see some indication on this 
campus that we are seen as 
something other than 
"walking wallets"?

Tornado knowledge can be traced to South Africa; 
modern science evaporates widely-accepted myth 



By JULIE MAGSAMEN 
Slalt Writer 

In Soulh Africa, there used 
to be tornado fighters When 
a tornado approached the 
village, the magician 
assembled all the people and 
led them In chants and 
cheers to turn aside the 
storm. If the storm con- 
tinued, the leader 
acknowledged the greater 
power of the wizard who sent 
the storm. 

Even though Indiana 
"Hoosiers" would scoff at 
such voodoo magic, there 
are still those who get fact 
mixed with fiction when it 
comes to tornadoes. 
Professor Emesl Agee of the 
Purdue University 
geoscience department, has 
studied tornadoes for twenty 
years. Below is a quiz that 
will help you test your 
knowledge of tornadoes and 
emergency procedures. 

1. An approaching tornado 
will sound like an oncoming 
train. 

False. A tornado may 
sound like a strain, jets, or a 
loud howling wind, or any 
number of loud noises. 

2. Still (motionless) air 
immediately following or 
during a severe thun- 
derstorm often signals 



pressure center away from 
other thunderstorm activity, 
it is very likely that they will 
be preceded initially by calm 
winds in response to the 
localized pressure field. 

3. If you are driving your 
car and see a tornado it is 
always best to stop and take 
cover. 

False. If you are directly 
in the storm's path it is best 
to take procedures to stay 
clear of its path. Since tor- 
nadoes travel from the 
southwest to the northeast 
you can test the way it is 
moving. If you are facing the 
storm, and it is not moving to 
your right or left you are 
directly in its path and 
should move accordingly. 

4. Tornadoes strike only 
during the spring and 
summer months. 

False. Tornadoes can 
occur anytime during the 
year and inany place. In the 
United States, May is the 
peak month and 4 p.m. to 6 
P m are the peak hours. 

5. A tornado is usually 
preceded by large 



storm are an indication a changes color during a storm 
tornado is near. because light is passing 

False. The sky sometimes through impure air. 



7. Tornadoes don't jump

True. In an analysis of 35

room (closet or bathroom) is 
the safest. Mobile homes 
should be abandoned during 
a warning for a community

IPFW enrollment 
down two percent 

By M1CHELE R. SHAFFER 
Editor-in-Chief 

Figures compiled at the end of regular registration this 
fall show that fail enrollment at IPFW is down two percent 
From last fall's figure of 10,334, said Jack Dahl, registrar, 

The two percent drop in enrollment was taken from 
registration figures for regular registration. "We expect the 
final number from late registration to be comparable t to last 
yearl/'saidPahl 

Dahl was confirming what Chancellor Thomas Wallace 
reported to the faculty on Aug. 25 However, both Dahl and 
Wallace said that the enrollment figure was on target 
because the university officials budgeted last year for a two 
percent drop in enrollment. "(We are) at projected 
enrollment figures for the fall," said Wallace. 

The exact enrollment figures from each of the registration 
periods cannot be released until they have been approved by 
Indiana University President John Ryan, said Dahl Friday. 
That approval should be made at the next Indiana University 
Trustees' meeting.

Heads up! 



IPFW volleyball learn member Sara Noll returns a play 
during team practice. Students interested in joining the 



turning in a 710 record 
1985, that's the task facing 
first-year Mastodon coach 
Jim Sharpe. 

The Mastodons had strung 
together seven consecutive 
winning records under 
former coach Ed 

Stefankiewicz before a series 
of nagging injuries and the 
ineligibility of some key 
players led to last year's 
disappointing performance. 

Sharpe fully expects to 
rebound into the winning 
column this season with a 
squad that features five 
seniors who have been a big 
pari of the club's winning 
ways in past seasons. 

The most talented per- 
formers among the seniors is

selection at mid-field, Bronn 
Pfeiffer (Wayne). At six 
feet, 165 lbs., Pfeiffer has 
scored IB goals and 14 
assists in his three-year 
IPFW career and has two 
all-Great Lakes Valley 
Conference (GLVC) 
selections to go along with 
his all-region honors. 



'"I look for Bronn to have 
his best season ever," 
Sharpe said of his star 
player. "He's really worked 
his tail off during the pre- 
season and he's in great 
shape He really wants to go 
out a winner." 

The key lo a successful 
1986 may be the return to 
form of senior forward 
Ricardo de la Torre (East 
Chicago). De la Torre, at 
five feet seven, 140 lbs., had 
24 goals and nine assists in 
his first two seasons at IPFW 
but that production fell to 
five goals and three assists 
last season. 

Junior Juan Diaz &lt;E. 
Chicago! was the team's top 
scorer in 1985 with seven 
goals and, after earning all- 
GLVC and a 11- region honors, 
he should again be a top 
offensive threat- 
Sophomore goalie Kevin 
Mann (Munster) will be 
charged with checking the 
opponent's threats this 
season. He started ten 
games last year, registering 



one shut out and turning a 
goals-against average 



good 



"It should be i 
season," Sharpe 
summing up the team's 
chances. "We won't have a 
lot or depth but our top 11 
players are very talented." 

Home town fans will have 
a good chance to see the 
team in action this season as 
nine or the 14 regular season 
games are in Fort Wayne. 
The Mastodons open Sept. 6 
at 7 p.m. against Northern 



Kentucky. During a two- 
week stretch in October, the 
Dons will contest five 
consecutive matches on 
home turf. 

"The schedule will be very 
nice this year," Sharpe said. 
"Travel time will be held to a 
minimum and all the folks in 
FortWayne will gel a chance 
to see us play."

SOCCER 
Head soccer coach Jim Sharpe, in his first year at 
IPFW, has been a big part of (he success that the 
Mastodons have en joyedover the years. A four-year letler 
winner, Sharpe completed his career at IPFW in 1983 
after helping the squad to a 12-4-1 record. He brings a 
wealth of soccer experience to the program as the squad 
tries lo rebound toils winning ways.

IPFW last fall after four letter-winning campaigns. A 
hard working defender, Renbarger was a strong con- 
tribution to the Mastodon's success in the early 1980's.
