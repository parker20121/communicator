Childcare center 
will not be licensed 



ByS. Brant Kelley 
News Editor 

At Monday's faculty senate 
meeting, Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Prank Borclli 
addressed Associate Professor of 
Psychology Jeff Wilson's concern 
over IPFW's planned child care 
center not operating under license. 

Borelli said the child care cen- 
ter was to be "structured for our 
students." Students want low-cost 
child care, and it could not be pro- 
vided if the child care center is 
licensed, he said. 

Borelli added child care for 
IPFW students will not be sub- 
standard. 

"In fact, stale laws governing 



child care are written in such a 
way so as to allow child care to be 
provided as we have proposed," 
he said. 

If the center is to be licensed, it 
would need to meet educational 
requirements, provide hot meals 
and maintain a certain staff-to- 
child ratio. 

"We learned this (the costs of 
operating a licensed child care 
center) the hard way with our 
recent experience with the 
Educare Center at Parkview 
Hospital. That facility and that 
care center is first rate. And it is 
still available for our faculty, staff 
and students; however, our stu- 
dents can't afford to use it. It is 
simply beyond the reach of their 



means," he said. 

He said IPFW does not have an 
extensive early childhood pro- 
gram, which would make a 
licensed child care center more 
feasible. 

According to Borelli, other uni- 
versities which have licensed day- 
care centers also have early child- 
hood education programs. Their 
day-care centers serve as lab 
schools for students, and general 
university funds help pay some of 
the operating cost. 

Borelli said until IPFW has an 
early childhood education pro- 
gram which would help reduce 
costs, IPFW would provide an 
unlicensed child care center. 



Gates center offers 
extra hours to students 



By Joel Kelley 

Guest Writer 

and S. Brant Kelley 

News Editor 

The Hilliard Gates Sports 
Center will be closed during 
certain hours to accommodate 
the sports teams that hold 
events and practices in the gym, 
and physical education classes 
that meet in the Gates Center. 

Controversy surrounded the 
closing of the Gates Center. 
Several students complained 
that the closing of the Gates 
Center conflicted with their 
workout schedules. 

Jim Wilkinson, facility man- 
ager/intramural director, said 
that the student complaints are 
blowing the situation out of 
proportion, and that it is very 
rare that a person cannot come 
in and use the Gates Center 
facilities whenever he or she 
wants. 

Wilkinson said, "Only cer- 
tain areas of the Gates Center 
will be closed at certain times." 
The gym will be off-limits only 
when sports teams are using it 
for games or practices. Only a 
small part of the weight room 
will be occupied by athletic 
teams while they are working 
out, but the rest of die weight 
room will be free for use. 
Certain areas of the Gates 
Center will be closed in order to 
accommodate two or three 
physical education classes. 

The Gates center has extend- 
ed its hours to make accommo- 
dations for those with conflict- 
ing schedules. "We have taken 
away two hours a week for the 
phys-ed classes, but have 
extended the Gates Center 
hours by eight hours to accom- 
modate the students," said 
Wilkinson. 

The only difference this 
semester in the Gates Center's 
scheduling is the addition of the 
physical education classes. The 
Gates Center will remain open, 
and its facilities accessible as 
much as possible, Wilkinson 
said.

Library merges 
circulation and help desks 



By S.Branl Kelley 
News Editor 

The Helmke Library merged 
its circulation and help desks 
into the service desk on May 17, 
1993, to give students better ser- 
vice, according to library direc- 
tor Larry W. Griffin. 

Several students said the 
change has produced no signifi- 
cant difference in service. 

Chris Bender, a student, said, 
"Every time I needed help, they 
were willing to help me." 
Another student said library per- 
sonnel came to help her; she 
didn't need to go up to the desk 
to ask. 

Judy Violette, assistant direc- 
tor of Helmke Library, said 
librarians are available during 
scheduled hours. Regular hours 
for librarians are from 9 a.m. to 
8 p.m., Monday through 
Thursday; 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.. 
Friday; 9 a.m. to noon, 
Saturday; and noon to 3 p.m., 



Sunday. She also said they are 
available at other times by 
appointment. 
Griffin said there are four ref- 



"Students 

are getting 

much better 

service now, ' 

said Violette. 



erence librarians to cover about 
90 hours a week. Each librarian 
is scheduled for part of the regu- 
lar hours, and is also committed 
to up to five hours a week of 
appointments with students who 
cannot come to the library dur- 
ing the regular hours. 



Violette said the library staff 
currently runs on a two-level 
system. The general service staff 
is the first level. 

The reference librarians are 
the second level to help students 
find information in particular 
subject matter. Each reference 
librarian has a particular area of 
expertise. "Students are getting 
much better service now," said 
Violette. 

Griffin said he wants to hire 
more reference librarians, but 
money is not available. He said 
the library operates on a budget 
of about $1 million a year. 

Chris Douse, chairman of leg- 
islative affairs, said he thinks the 
library is underfunded. The Fort 
Wayne Public Library operates 
on about $13 million a year, 
according to Griffin. 

Both Griffin and Violette 
emphasized that students are 
welcome to give suggestions to 
the library.

State supports 
Helmke Library 



By Angie Smith 
Staff Writer 

Most of Helmke Library's operat- 
ing budget comes from state funds, 
according lo Larry Griffin, associate 
librarian and director. He said, 
"Ultimately, materials come from 
student tuition and tax dollars: the 
percentage of personal gifts is 
small." 

Other money that aids the library 
budget comes from the Indiana- 
Purdue endowment fund. "Specific 
gifts are donated from time to lime, 
but the money is donated for specific 
items." said Griffin. 

Most of the library budget goes 
for buying books, catalogs, journals 
such as Reader's Guide and indexes 
such as biological indexes. 

The 10 systems in the library 
were recently upgraded due io the 



Indiana University System-Wide 
Library Automation Budget which 
gets money from the stale legislature. 

"Lasi year we received S37.000 lo 
upgrade the IO's to PC's," said 
Griffin. 

The total amount of money given 
to die library through die administra- 
tion for the 1994-95 academic year 
was S3 19,225 for books, journals, 
indexes and catalogs. 

The estimated amount of money 
expected lo be received from the 
Indiana-Purdue endowmeni fund is 
S80.000. 

A study conducted by Griffin 
found the average cost of journals, 
such as scientific and technical jour- 
nals, to be around S850 a title. 
General titles cost an average of 
$160. 

Indexes and catalogs, on an aver- 
age, cost about S 1,000 a title.

Depression: 



Thirteen steps 
to eliminate stress 



Vicky Clarke 
Guest Writer 
"I can't make it this semester. I 
can't eat or steep. I'm so tired of 
trying." Sound familiar? At IPFW 
we've all made similar comments 
or heard others make them. Some 
of us have struggled and made it 
through these limes, but many of 
us gel through school carrying this 
excess emotional baggage until it 
becomes heavier and heavier and 
we want to give up. We become 
very depressed. In fact, estimates 
in 1992 reflect thai 65 percent of 
college women and 51 percent of 
college men experienced at least 
transient episodes of depression. 
Earlier studies revealed that one 
student in six will experience 
symptoms of depression, and one 
in 12 will require professional 
help. Students begin lo feel that 
their situation is hopeless, and 
they are helpless to control the 
huge stressors in their lives. Many, 
in addition to the responsibilities 
of school, have jobs and families 
which place even more demands 
upon their time and energy. If you 
or someone you know is about to 
"go over the edge," there is "light 
at the end of the tunnel." You can 
break the cycle of depression. 

Many of us this semester have 
experienced situational depres- 
sion, These are transient episodes, 
usually related lo periods of 
increased stress and lasting until 
the stress has diminished or we 
have adjusted our lifestyles by 
creating new ways of coping. In 
these situations, it is interesting to 
noie lhat those who cope best 
appear to have personality styles 
lhat reinforce commitment (the 
ability lo believe in the value of 
who one is), control (the ability to 
believe and aci as one who influ- 
ences life's events), and challenge 
(perceiving the stressor as an 
opportunity for growth). This per- 
sonality construct is referred to as 
"hardiness," and many of us uti- 
lize these positive attributes lo get 
through stressful evenls. For many 
of us this becomes a formidable 
challenge; for some of us i( can 
become an unattainable goal and 
we reach a point of "losing con- 
trol." We are left lo wonder at that 
point, "How could this happen to 
me?" As a result, we become clin- 
ically depressed. 

A clearer understanding of a 
depressive disorder reveals thai it 
is a whole-body illness, involving 
your body, mood, and thoughts. It 
affects the way you eat. sleep, the 
way you feel about yourself, and 



the way you think about things. It 
is not a passing blue mood. It is 
not a sign of personal weakness, 
laziness or lack of will-power as 
many of us have been conditioned 
to believe. People who are clini- 
cally depressed have usually 
arrived there through a progres- 
sive series of events. They can no 
longer "pull themselves logether" 
and get betler. Without treatment, 
symptoms can last for weeks, 
months or even years. These 
sympioms will interfere signifi- 
cantly with activities of daily liv- 
ing. 

Some people wilh depression 
have mood cycles wilh lerrible 
"lows" (depression) and inappro- 
priate "highs" (mania). This con- 
dition is called a bipolar or manic- 
depressive disorder. A less severe 
type of depression, dysthmia, is 
characterized by long-term symp- 
toms thai do not disable, but keep 
you from functioning at "full- 
steam" or from feeling good. 

The cause of depression can be 
linked to biological, genetic, psy- 
chological and other faclors. 
Certain life style chances such as 
lhat experienced in college, chron- 
ic illness, or exireme grief and 
loss mighi also contribute. In 
some people, depression can occur 
even when life is going well. 
Alcohol and drugs can also be a 
factor. Psychological make-up 
also plays a role in depression in 
lhat people who have low self- 
esleem or who consistently view 
their world wilh pessimism and 
are readily overwhelmed by stress 
are prone to depression. 

It is imporiant lo realize that 
negative views are a pan of clini- 
cal depression and typically do 
not accurately reflect your situa- 
tion. Severity of depression varies 
with the individual, bul some of 
the more common symptoms 
include: 

- Persistent sad, anxious or 
empty mood 

-Feelings of hopelessness, pes- 
simism, guiltrworthle^ncss or 
hopelessness 

-Loss of inlerest in activities 
you once enjoyed 

-Ins omnia, early -morning 
awakening or oversleeping 

-Decreased appetite and/or 
weight loss or overeating and 
weight gain 

-Thoughts of death or suicide 

- Restlessness, irritability 
-Difficulty concentrating, 

remembering, making decisions 
-Persistent physical sympioms 
that do not respond to 




treatment, such as headaches, 
digestive disorders, and chronic 
pain. 

If you have experienced five or 
more of the above symptoms for 
at least two weeks, it is important 
that you consult wilh your family 
physician or health care provider. 
Many limes people have trouble 
asking for help or they may blame 
themselves and feel an over- 
whelming sense of guilt and loss 
of control. Counseling services are 
readily available ai IPFW by call- 
ing 481-6595. Also, emergency 
phone lines arc available through 
Park Center and Lindenview 
Regional Behavior Center. These 
services can provide both emo- 
tional support and direction. If 
you do decide to choose treat- 
ment, be encouraged, because 
negative thinking begins to fade 
as treatment begins to take effect. 

Usually, depression is handled 
in the clinical environment 
through a variety of treatment 



modalities such as psychotherapy, 
antidepressant medication, group 
sessions or a combination of 
these. Treatment is a gradual 
process depending on your partic- 
ular needs, and although many 
people have suffered through their 
situation without help, they usual- 
ly experience subsequent 
episodes. The U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services 
reports thai after three episodes of 
depression without treatment, the 
chances of having a fourth are 90 
percent Therefore, it is necessary 
thai you receive early intervention 
to prevent recurrence. 

In the meantime, here are some 
useful suggestions which can be 
utilized by college students to 
help get through episodes of stress 
and depression regardless of 
where it may fall on the mild, 
moderate or severe continuum. 

-Do not take on too much 
responsibility. 

-Break large tasks into small 



ones and set priorilies. 

-Do not expect loo much from 
yourself. 

-Try to spend lime with other 
people. It's better than being 
alone. 

-Participate in activities and 
hobbies outside of school lhat 

make you feel betler and don'i 
be discouraged if your mood is 
not greatly improved right away. 

-Get regular physical check- 
ups. Your problem might be phys- 
iological. 

-Gel adequate resl and exercise. 
Maintain a nutritious diet low in 
fats and sugar. 

-Attend church or atlend to 
spiritual matters which concern 
you. 

-Do not make major life deci- 
sions while depressed or over- 
whelmed. 

-Do not expeel to snap out of 
your depression. People rarely do. 
Don't blame yourself for not 
being up to par. 



-Do not accept your negative 
thinking. It will disappear as you 

respond to treatment. 

-Get help from family and 
friends. Share your concerns with 

others. 

-Do someihing beneficial for 
someone else. 

Above all. keep your mind 
optimistic, fixed on the things you 
want and off the things you don't 
want. Get'professiohal help if you 
feel it is appropriate for your situ- 
ation. Eventually, this semester 
will end like all the others, but if 
you find yourself overwhelmed 
and depressed, remember — Ihere 
is light at the end of the tunnel.
