Harassment charges plague IPFW chair 



Tbc new choir of IPFWs music 
department has a put that haunts him 
and could land bim in federal court 
sometime next year, 

John E, Taylor, former chair of the 
fine arts and music departments at 
Tennessee Technological University 
(Till), reportedly practiced sexual dis- 



md hai 






unprofessional and unethical practices 
against three of his fellow female 
coworkers. 

In August, o federal judge ordered 
that Taylor, after seven tries to get the 
lawsuit dismissed, will personally be 
liable along with TTU to stand (rial for 
those actions. 

Maria Fcra, former assistant professor 
of Ait History al TTU who resigned in 
May 1991, said in a letter delivered to 
Angclo A. Volpe. president of TTU 
that "sexual discrimination and harass- 
ment, unprofessional and unethical 
practices on tbc part of the present 
chairman, John Taylor, make working 
conditions intolerable." 

Lisa Summer, former music therapy 
professor at TTU. accused Taylor of 
sexual harassment and discrimination 
and filed charges with the EEOC after 
the university discounted her com- 
plaints about the leaching workload 
Taylor assigned to her in comparison to 
mole counterparts in the Fall of 1991. 

She also accused Taylor of unethical 
behavior for hiring a male TTU music 
Student to do a "flasher act" at a private 
party. 

TTU offered lo provide Summer a 



payment of S65.000; along with a posi- 
tive recommendation lo future employ- 
ers if she would drop the EEOC filing 
She refused, and after being charged 
with failing to teach her assigned 
courscload, was fired by the university 
"for willful failure to perform assigned 
duties and unprofessional conduct," 
according lo TTU records. 

Summer was Ihe first tenured faculty 
(o ever be fired at TTU. If the federal 
court finds her a victim of sexual 
harassment and gender discrimination, 
her lost wages and damages could 
exceed S2 million. 

The third professor, Christine 
Koczwara. a well-respected artist of 
international reputation, filed charges 
against TTU and John Taylor on June 
1. 1993. She claims that she was dis- 
criminated against with an overload of 
teaching and given less pay and less 
desirable leaching assignments than 
male professors. 

Koczwara claims that she "was paid 
less than males performing the same 
and otherwise treated differently and 
less favorably than males." 

On June 22. 1993, Taylor sent his res- 
ignation to Volpe. president of TTU, 
effective August 7. He assumed the. 
duties of chair of the music department 
of IPFW on August 1, after being hired 
on July 9, after receiving excellent rec- 
ommendations from the TTU adminis- 

Sleve Wildsmith, former managing 
editor of TTU's student 1 newspaper, 
Tbe Oracle, and now a professional 
journalist, slated that he researched and 
published more than 20 articles about 
the charges against Taylor. 

When asked what the student climate 



has been and the current attitude toward 
Taylor, Wildsmith offered his osscss- 

"During the Lisa Summer case, most 
music therapy students didn't agree 
with her." said Wildsmith. "By con- 
trast, Christine Koczwara is one of the 
most respected artists in the South, and 
she is one of the happiest people I 
know." 

"Her lawsuit throws more suspicion 
on Taylor and the university. It was a 
shock lo us that she came forward." 

He also stated Ibal three female facul- 
ty accusing Taylor of tbe same charges 
while chair of both departments has 
cost bim community support when 
Koczwara filed suit. 

Last summer. Kristic Schlundt, sum- 
mer editor in chief of the 
Communicator, and F. Lane Douse, 
summer managing editor, researched 
and published a story on the harassment 
lawsuit and IPFW's reasoning for hir- 
ing Taylor, 

David McCants. the interim vice 
chancellor for academic affairs last 
summer, staled to the Communicator 
that "to my knowledge, Mr. Taylor bas 
never been sued. It is the university thai 
is being sued." 

Joseph Summer, husband of Lisa 
Summer, sent faxes to McCants, Gerald 
Ratliff. Dean of Fine and Performing 
Arts, and other administrators concern- 
ing Taylor's lawsuits filed by both 
Summer in 1992 and Koczwara in 
1993. 

Ratliff said that Taylor, as per policy 
on this campus, was hired in as a 
tenured professor at IPFW. 

A local attorney. Cliff Files, gave his 
opinion on tbe legality of Taylor's posi- 






n IPFW Hair casl member looks about as ft to say, 'Are you sure this is in the scripl?" Pholoby Paul Moring. 



Honors convocation 

Students, faculty receive awards 



Three professors 
distinguished 



The honors convocation for Ihe 
1992-93 academic year was held last 
Sunday, October 3 at the Gales Sports 
Cenler. Approximately 3000 students 
were honored. 

The annual honors convocation is 
hosicd by ihe IPFW university admin- 
istration to honor the students who 
achieve academic excellence. 
About 1200 students made the Dean's 
List last year. Students make the 
Dean's List for having accumulated a( 
least 12 credit hours thai count toward 
graduation and having mainlaincd a 
3.5 cumulative GPA, In addition to 
having enrolled in al least 6 credit 
hours for (be semester and having 
maintained a 3.0 semester GPA. 

Last year, approximately 1B00 addi- 
tional students made the Semester 
Honors List for having accumulated at 
least 6 credits hours and having main- 




lained a 2.0 cumulative GPA, in addi- 
tion lo having achieved at least a 3.5 
semester GPA. 

After IPFW Chancellor Jo Ann Lanl? 
performed ihe welcoming ceremony, 
Ihe honors students were recognized by 
Lantz and were introduced to the audi- 
ence by Ihe professors appointed to that 
task. The students were formally greet- 



ed by the vice chancellors for student 
and academic affairs and tbe deans of 
all tbc colleges who together formed 
a receiving line and sbook the bands 
of all the honor students, 

Students who had received scholar- 
ships were also recognized. 
Faculty tenures and promotions were 
announced at Ihe convocation, as 
well. 

Three professors were further dis- 
tinguished: Joseph Chandler, associ- 
ate professor of organizational lead- 
ership and supervision, received the 
Community Advisory Council 
Award; Joseph Meyers, associate 
professor of music, received the 
Friend of the University Teaching 
Award; and David Skellon, associate 
director of development, received Ihe 
Ulmer Award. 

Musical selections were performed 
by ibe University Brass ensemble 
under the direction of George 
Cavanaugh, associate professor of 
music, and by VocalEsscncc, the uni- 
versity vocal jazz ensemble under the 
direction of Patrice Madura, a lectur- 
er for Ibe music department- 
Students were presented with cer- 
tificates of their achievement at the 
modest reception in the Walb 
Memorial Union Ballroom following 
the 



lion on employment here at the univer- 

"How ii affects him here will depend 
on what has happened here. What kind 
of work has he done here? Do these 
thing? keep following him around? His 
fate is in his own bands." said Files, 

After Schlundt's and Douse' s summer 
article, tbc Communicator tried to 
obtain photos of Taylor from both TTU 
archives and IPFW archives. Two 
unnamed sources, one from TTU and 
another from IPFW. said that Taylor 
has requested removal of bis pictures 
from the files. 

In September, Taylor refuses lo give 
us permission to photograph bim or 
provide us wilb a photo, although tbe 
Fori Wayne Newspapers have printed a 
photo of him recently.

Child care 

issue 

surfaces 



By Ramona McGown 
Chler Reporter 

There have been many complaints on 
campus concerning tbe rumor that stu- 
dents have been allowing their children 
to sit outside tbc classroom while they 
are attending class. Tbe need for child 
care on campus remains a pressing 
issue, one which is often ignored by 
those in administrative positions. 

One year ago, IPFW, Ivy Tech and 
Parkview formed a consortium and cre- 
ated a child care program, Children's 
EducCare, which allowed all involved 
in the consortium to receive child core. 

On December 31.1992 JPFW decided 
to no longer participate with the other 
establishments because the administra- 
tion believed thai the program was 
putting a financial strain on tbc school. 
Frank Borclli. the vice chancellor for 
sludent affairs, states thai "even though 
B?FW is no longer a part of tbc consor- 
tium, those wishing to enter their chil- 
dren in the Children's EducCare may 
still do so." 

The going rates for Children's 
EducCare are as follows: the daily rale 
for infanls is 523; if one wishes lo pay 
weekly for an infant. Ibe rale is S105 
per week. For toddlers the daily rate is 
S2I and Ihe weekly rate is S95. For 
older children, the rale goes down Sll 
for every year of age. The current rales 
for a two year old are S21 per day and 
S94 per week. If a parent makes 55 an 
hour and has lo pay S105 a week for 
child care, how much remains for liv- 
ing expenses? 

The program is not only unrealistic, it 
appears to be almost useless for the 
people most in need of child care: those 
with a limited income 

Unfortunately, Ihosc in the adminis- 
tration do not have to deal with [he 
financial difficulties cncounlcrd al an 
income level of this sort. Tbe program 
appears to be a bandage on the wound 
rather than a solution or cure. 

Despite the University's administra- 
tive stuffs unwillingness to come up 
with a other avenues for those needing 
child care. Deb Deere, Child Care 
Referral Services Advocate, has made 
available to students a referral and a 
listing of those businesses who have 
cbildcare available, and Ibeir current 

Anyone wishing to contact Deere for 
more information may call the Center 
for Women and Reluming Adults al

Staff Editorial 

Consenting adults follow 
guidelines 



It's happened. We've finally 
reached the breaking point. 
Yes means yes, no definitely 
means no, silence, you'd better 
just step out . 

Antloch college, located in 
Ohio, has come out with the 
most complete of all college 
freshman manuals. The 
school's policy on sexual rela- 
tions is clearly stated. The 
questions about sex are to 
come before the act, not after, 
and if either partner is not 
sure. STOP! Go no further. 

Communication is the key to 
life, which holds true in rela- 
tionships. All relationships. 
Ask those people who've been 
together 20 years and then ask 
those who haven't had a stable 
relationship yet. What's the 
difference? Communication. 

We've reached the decade of 
the woman. Women are being 
accepted more and more as 
equals-even in the bedroom. 

Women have the right to 
make decisions, too. 
Especially those that affect 
them the most. 

WHEN, Women are asked 
about how much they are com- 
fortable with, and if, by 
chance, women aren't sure of 
the answer, that means no. 
Why? Because the absence of 
the word no doesn't mean yes. 

No longer is pregnancy the 
main issue in sexual relations 
and AIDS has beaten to death 
the ridiculous and thankfully 
passe" 70's pop culture myth. 
We've come to a time when 
sexual fears and sexual poli- 
cies have become a regular in 
everyday conversations among 
adults, teenagers, even school 
children. 



Why does Antioch college 
feel the need to write a "how 
to" manual for students. Have 
we come to a time when we 
need to have everything clear- 
ly slated and explained for us 
like we are in kindergarten? If 
so, then we've come to a time 
when packages of condoms 
should come with a pre-print- 
ed insert listing the specific 
questions that need to be 
asked at each step of sex play 
with the one word that gives 
the thumbs up for the whole 
thing. YES! should be high- 
lighted in bold print with a 
message underneath that 
states: Let's review... After 
asking for consent to have 
sex, did you hear this high- 
lighted word? If so, proceed 
with care. If not, leave your 
partner alone. 

What we propose is that peo- 
ple all learn to respect each 
other enough that we ask 
questions regarding our will- 
ingness or hesitation to 
engage in any activity with 
one another. Even the closest 
relationships are not meant to 
be mind-reading exercises. 
Talk it over, then if you both 
feel that it is right, only then 
is it okay. 

To all of those responsible 
members of the Antioch 
Freshman manual writing 
committee, we understand 
your concern and commend 
your effort. But let's forgo 
the flow charts of consentual 
sexual relations and credit one 
another with just a bit of 
human rationality and a dash 
of common sense. Good luck 
in revision, Antioch!

You didn't hear it from me, but... 



By F. Lane Douse, 
Editor in chief 

You didn't hear ii from mc, but 

ihe current widespread rumor of 
gang members driving with their 

lights off and someone flashing 
their lights 10 signal the gang 
members to literally knock their 
lights out or kill ihem is not true. 
I spoke with University Police 
Chief Loren DenHartog about the 
alleged "gang initiation." He con- 
tacted the Illinois police depart- 
ment 10 check and sec if any inci- 
dent like lliat had been confirmed, 
and found that this scenario has 
not been confirmed. 

So, for all of you thai are con- 
cerned about this situation, it is 
not true! But 1 do urge that, if 
you do flash your lights and 
someone follows you, to take 
caution, use your head, and go to 
the nearest police station. I doubt 
the gang would follow you there. 

Now, let's talk about ol' Billy- 
boy in the White House! 1 think 
President Clinton needs to know 
that we, the people, arc not ready 
for another war. Now. maybe 1 
am making too much of the situa- 
tion in Somalia, (arid I ihink not) 
but isn't this similar to what the 
United States encountered in 
Vietnam? 

We have just begun to heal from 
the Persian Gulf War. The last 
thing we. the citizens of the 
United States, need to go through 
is another war. Maybe Billy 
thinks his position on Somalia 
will help boost bis standing wiih 
the people. However, several sur- 
veys have suggested overwhelm- 
ingly that US. troops should be 
pulled out of Somalia. Billy can 
only loose by leaps and bounds 
the already half-hearted confi- 




dence of the American people, 

I trunk you need to listen to the 
people, President Clinton, and pull 
our troops out of Somalia. Or does 
someone have one good reason 
why we should stay? If so, I would 
like lo hear it! 

On to bigger and better things! As 
a college newspaper, we receive 
several papers from other colleges. 
Recently I was looking through the 
Ball State's Daily News, when I 
saw tie beading "You didn'i hear it 
from me, but . . . aliens are . . ." and 
I thought to myself, boy, where 
have I seen that before? 

Then, I was flipping through 
Indiana University South Bend's 
The Preface, when I saw that (hey 
are going to start an advice column 
with get this, Aunt Stella. Aunt 
Stella . . . Aunt Louise, uh, I get it! 
She must be Aunt Louise's 'long 
lost sister." 

I just want the respective papers to 
know that we are terribly, terribly, 
terribly flattered that you have 
decided to include these additions 
in your paper. Imitation is the best 



form of flattery, eb? 

If you haven't seen 'Hair' I sug- 
gest that you do attend. I went to 
opening night along with a good 
friend of mine. Kristie Schlundt. It 
was an excellent production. I 
walked into the theater feeling like 
a child. The symbolic set and the 
music left me in awe. 

After the show was over, I left the 
theater knowing I had learned a 
great deal about not only the 
Vietnam War but also how 
Americans felt back ihen, what 
they stood for and why. It was 
great. 

As far as the nudity is concerned. 
You'll have lo see if for yourself. 
But, I'll tell you this much. I fell 
kind of embarrassed. 

Why? 

I don't know. I think maybe 
because society says you have (o 
wear clothes because the body is 
sacred and all. It's just good man- 
ners. However, when it gets right 
down lo the point, (he body is beau- 
tiful. It's the only ihing tha( groups 
us inlo one category, human. It's 
nolhing to be ashamed of, it's 



something to be proud of, and 
nudity is just a fact of life. 

Get over it! 

I ami 

Hey! You know something that I 
have noticed for the longest time! 
I've noticed how Fori Wayne 
people drive. Maybe it's just me, 
but people no longer regard a red 
light as meaning stop. Maybe 
they have that bull mentality: 
when ihcy see red, they go. 

I'm here to tell you, folks, that's 
not how it is. By running those 
'red' lights, you put yourself and 
oiher people in danger of gelling 
injured, if not killed, because of 
your reckless actions. After it's 
all over with, you are (he ones 
who yell the loudesi claiming it's 
the other person's fault, if you're 
nol dead. 

So, lei' s remember, if the light is 
yellow turning red — that's 
acceptable. However, if it's solid 
red, let's just wait our turn. 

Finally, for all of our Native 
American students or people with 
Native American heritage, IPFW 
is having its first Native 
American Student Alliance 
(NASA) meeting on October 18tb 
ai noon till 1:30 in Walb Union 
room 116. This is the organiza- 
tional meeting. I suggest that all 
students who have an interest 
should attend. If you have any 
questions, call Karen Monroe ai 
422-2029 or Bob Hawley, associ- 
ate professor of Human Services, 
who is going to be the group's 
adviser. His number is 484-8767. 

That's all have I for now. 
Remember if you hear any tidbits 
or anything like that, feel free lo 
drop ihem off by the office. I'll 
look into it immediately. 

Don't forget, you didn't hear it 
from me. 




Letters to the editor 

IPFW Student feels gun control necessary 



Dear Editor 

We have a big problem in our nation, 
my friend. I speak about the prolifera- 
tion of guns or more precisely the pro- 
liferation of the use of guns. It is scary 
lo think that by doing a good deed, 
flashing your headlights to J 



lights 



off, 



could receive a death sentence. A por- 
tion of our population has absolutely no 
respect for the individual freedoms we 
assume are guaranteed as citizens of the 
United Slates. 
What can be done to combat this 
problem of growing violence? Let's 
face it, gun control is a sham. Sure take 
away all the guns and there is no prob' 
lem of people getting shot, but one of 
our rights is to own and bear arms So 
we cannot really protect the right of lib- 



erty by revoking a different right. The 
solution lies in the opposite direction. 
We can make it not only a right but a 
duty for each citizen to own and bear 
arms. Of course, this idea may seem 
radical, but is one we must seriously 

In elementary school, each student 
would be required to participate in a 
program on safety, proper use and 
maintenance of firearms. Once passed 
they would be allowed lo carry firearms 
- not concealed, of course. Throughout 
their education, refresher courses and 
courses teaching advanced defensive 
techniques may be mandatory. It would 
be taught to only use the weapon for 
self-defense. Since they have had prop- 
er (raining there is a good chance they 
will hit what they ore aiming it. It is so 
sad to sec innocent bystanders get 
injured in a shooting when it could be 



prevented with jus( a few lessons. 

This new mandate would also make it 
more difficult to get a driver's license. 
Each person would need to be able to 
accurately fire a weapon from a moving 
vehicle, of course, the type of firearm 
you would use in the weapons portion 
of your driver's license lest would 
depend on your annual income If you 
are poor, most likely you will be dri- 
ving a crappy car which no one is going 
to mess with, so qualifying with a .22 
or .25 caliber would be fine But if you 
have money, you will need lo protect 
your Lexus or BMW with a 9 mm 
semi-automatic or Uzi. More difficult, 
sure, but necessary. Of course, you 
could always hire a driver who is an 
expert marksman - probably the best 
way to go. 

I am sure there will he impacts in 
many other areas. All problems can be 



worked out in time. No, we should not 
implement the plan full scale right off 
the baL Pilot programs should be start- 
ed immediately, though, in the inner 
cities. Since Ibis is where the greatest 
need is and the greatest benefit can be 
achieved. Remember guns don't kill 
people, bullets ripping through organs 
kill people.

Interview with local representative of nation shows helping attitude 



By Ramona McGown 
CbcIT Reporter 

When most individuals think of Black 
Muslims (bey often perions lend to 
attach a negative connotation to those 
representing this group. In this one on 
one interview with Jeffrey X. a local 
representative of the Nation of Islam, I 
wish to give information that most 
mass media is not inclined to touch 
upon and to share some of the laudable 
as well as beneficial qualities of the 
Nation of Islam 

Ramona: Why did you decide to 
become a Muslim? 

Jeffrey X : I was given a tape by a 
friend that contained a speech given by 
Louis Farcakhan and I really enjoyed 



arid agreed with the principles that he 

Ramona: What about your religion do 
you think is special and essential for 
those in your community? 
Jeffrey X: I feel that my religion repre- 
sents freedom, justice, and equality. 
These three things are also the princi- 
ples of the Nation of Islam but also 
those of the universe. 
Ramona: Can you tell us what position 
you bold in Nation? 
Jeffrey X: I am the local representative 
in Fort Wayne for Minister Louis 
Fanakhan,. 

Ramona: What essential practices does 
a Muslim have to follow? 
Jeffrey X: To do for your brother as 
you would want done for yourself 
Ramona: In your organization what are 



the levels of power? 
Jeffrey X; There is really one essential 
power in the Nation of Islam, that being 
Allah. 

Ramona: Most individuals often won- 
der why you wear suits and bow does 
this add (o your religion? 
Jeffrey X. This gives tbe young men a 
distinction about themselves as well as 
builds upon their self esteem. 
Ramona: What do you feel most 
strongly about concerning Ihe message 
given by the Nation of Islam? 
Jeffrey X: I feel the Nation teaches 
truth and through this Afro -Americans 
can get a true history of themselves and 
a true sense of where they come from. 
Ramona: What businesses does your 
organization have besides the publica- 
tion of the Final Call? 



Jeffrey X: Our organization has bak- 
eries, meat packaging companies, as 1 
well as farmland, 

Ramona: Does this organization stress 
education and if so do you have your 
own schools? 
Jeffrey X: We have both schools as 



What 



i docs 



Farrakhan play in the Nation of Islam? 
Jeffrey X: Minister Farrakhan repre- 
sents the role model of proper manhood 
and a conduct that all men should fol- 

Ramona: What would you like to share 
with the IPFW students that you feel 
needs to be addressed by those attend- 
ing tbe university? 



Jeffrey X: Those in college who con- 
sider themselves educated should look 
more into the slate of those who arc 
oppressed. I feel that most college stu- 
dents arc simply going through the 
motions while attending a university. 
Too often the students arc not motivat- 
ed by the knowledge that they are 
acquiring at school but rather those 
monetary rewards that they will be 
receive as a result from their degree. 
Ramona: Most individuals tend to feel 
that the Nation of Islam has a very neg- 
ative attitude toward white people? 
Jeffrey X: I do not feel that the Nation 
has a negative altitude towards whiles. 
Often when the Nation speaks the truth 
of both past and present actions by 



those who are in power, we are seen as 
behaving in a militant manner and 
therefore perceived is being hateful or 
possessing negative attitudes towards 
white. 

Ramona: What final thing do you think 
makes the Nation of Islam a unique 
organization? 

JcffrcyX: The Nation of Islam has had 
the most productive results in the histo- 
ry of black people. We have went into 
neighborhoods that were primarily 
crime ridden areas and have successful- 
ly lowered Ihe crime to a minimal level, 
without the use of guns or weapons.

Aunt Louise tells all 




Dear Aunt Louisi 



I have a problem I think you may be 
able to belp me I have a small crush on 
my besi friend's boyfriend. Okay, I like 
bim. They are having a really hard 
lime He confides in mc about their 
problems because be can't tell his girl- 
friend, my best friend. Often when he 
tells me his problem. I give him advice 
on the situation, I make il a point not to 
tell his girlfriend, my best friend. She 
will come back and tell mc what he has 
done. Evctually, she ends up asking me 
for advice. I'm afraid I am goingto 
allow my own personal feelings influ- 
ence what 1 tell them both. What should 
I do? 



Yours, 



Dear Helples 



Dear 



,Ic 



u are between a 
rock and a hard place. What I think you 
need to do in (his instance is stay out of 
Ibc whole situation. Since you have 
feelings for this young man, I think you 
really need to remove yourself and look 
inside your little heart to find out where 
your emotions really stand. It could be 
just a little crush. 
If you find that your feelings arc true 



for bim, I think the best thing for you to 
do is tell them the truth. Explain to 
(hem that you enjoy tbeir mutual 
friendship, but you can't continue to be 
a sounding board for them becuasc it 
may destroy their relationship. Then 
you should encourage them to solve the 
problem themselves which is their 
communication line. Communication 
is the key lo any relationship, 
I remember, when my porkchop 
Dorcus and I would fight. I would com- 
plain to my best friend, Bethel. She 
would tell me, "Louise! You need to 
talk to Dorcus. He's the one you mar- 
ried!" And to tbis day, I talk to my 

As far as your feelings, if she truly Is 
your best friend. You'll work through 
them until you ore out of this cycle. 

Your loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

1 have been single for the longest 
time. 1 have a place and no one is there. 
My friends have gotten married. They 
no longer have time for mc. What 
should I do? 



Dear Lonely Man, 

I know what you're going through is 
terribly painful. You feci as if you are 
alone and no one cares. I went through 
that period when my Dorcus was off 
fighting in one of the World Wars. It's 
been so long I have forgotten which 

My little sugar cube, what you need to 
do is become more active at school, if 
you are a student or at your place of 
employment. You could become a Big 
Brother. Everyone needs somebody. 
Get out and enjoy life! 

As far as finding a male, just continue 
on your positive tack and look at the 
nice wholesome women at church. 

You'll find someone when the time is 
right You gotta have a Utile faith! 



Computertutors available 



By Anita Stein bacher, 
Copy Editor 

The first impression one might gel 
walking through the computer lab for 
the School of Arts and Sciences, is an 
overcrowded room full of computers 
and equipment with so much activity 
at times, that it borders on chaos. 

The computer lab is located in the 
Classroom Medical building, Room 
214 with Instructional Technology 
Coordinators, Randall Wert and 
Debra Sewards. Wert handles the 
networking aspect of the computers 
and Sewards handles training. 

When Wert and Sewards took over 
their newly created positions in the 
fall of 1990, they took over an empty 
room. The primary goal at the time 
was assessing needs. What did the 
faculty want lo do? How did they 
plan to do it and what did they need? 
At Ihc lime, the immediate needs 
were for equipment, training faculty 
to use the equipment and teaching 
faculty bow to integrate technology 
into their instruction. 
Consequently, 50 XT computers (not 
new) were purchased, along with SO 
Gateway computers and 7 Macintosh 
computers, for use by faculty. 50% of 
the purchase was funded by the 
School of Arts and Sciences and 50% 
by the Vice -Chancellor's office. 

Today ihc lab houses two IBM- 
compatible computers, 7 Macintosh 
computers, a laser disc player, two 
CD ROM drives and a Macintosh 
scanner. The Macintosh computer 
and the PC can both do mulii-media. 

Althougb Sewards' job initially 
included a lot of group training, it has 
evolved into working wilh individual 
needs and at times, training individ- 
ual faculty's classes, eg,. Racbelle 
Darabi's English as a Second 
Language (ESL) class on the rudi- 
ments of WordPerfect 5.1. She also 
finds herself working with conver- 
sions, most recently, WordPerfect for 



Ibe Macintosh. Sewards is also 
responsible for writing and distribut- 
ing several band-outs on various 
IBM and Macintosh programs. She 
often acts as a resource person as 
well, primarily for the School of Arts 

"Our future is in multi-media," says 
Sewards, who has developed a keen 
interest in il. "Alice to Ocean," a 
very impressive program, developed 
on Macromind (a multi-media pro- 
gram for the Macintosh) is about a 
woman in Australia who rode from 
(be middle of the road to the ocean. 
Film fool age, music and professional 
photography has been co-ordinated 
together in this computer program - 
(it took $50,000 to produce). 

In contrast, the HyperCard authoring 



that 



with 



Macintosh computers bought 
much less sophisticated, yet extreme- 
ly useful as a teaching tool. Michael 
Kauffman of the English and 
Linguistics department and Julie 
Schcrz, Audiology and Speech 
Sciences department arc leaching 
HyperCard lo their students who have 
to create HyperCard stacs for their 
assignments. Sewards taught 
HyperCard lo both of these professors 
and to date, has taught the program 
about 30 people. 
"The hardest part is learning to use 
technology properly and coming up 
with ibe right materials," says 
Sewards. Her main challenge right 
now is the need lo create HyperCard 
slacks on various subjects and she is 
looking for student volunteers willing 
to devote time lo tbis project under 
the guidance of them. She recom- 
mends some computer experience, on 
cither an IBM or a Macintosh com- 
puter, preferably in a Windows envi- 
ronment. We hope some students 
lake her up on tbis challenge It 
could be a valuable learning experi- 



Reincarnation 



The IPFW Student Activities Board 

presents "The Back Doors" in concert 
on Thursday. October 14 at 8 p.m. at 
the Gales Sports Center. 

"The Back Doors" recreates 
Ibc classic songs of the popular 60s 
band, "The Doors." with favorites such 
as "L.A. Women". "Light My Fire," 
and Love Her Madly. "The Back 
Doors" consists of four musicians that 
have been logelher for 10 years. Lead 
by vocalist Jim Hakim, tbey ha've 
appeared on national television in 
shows such as Entertainment Tonight 
and PM Magazine. They have been 
touted as a shocking reincarnation of 
Jim Morrison, 

Hakim is amazingly similar in appear- 
ance to Morrison, both in looks and 
voice and met Morrison personally. 

"The Doors" were a mystical, eerie 
sounding group," said Hakim. 
Morrison's music and sound is most 
interesting, and that's why I decided to 

"Jim Morrison wrolc his songs a very 
certain way. I'm interested in the mood, 
sound and feel of the song and I want 
to portray that to the audience," added 

Besides sounding and acting just like 
Morrison, Hakim has his own style 
which gears him up for a performance. 
Hakim said that much of his success 
onstage his attributes to his preparation 

The group was formed as a way to 
keep Ihe music of Morrison accessible 
lo young audiences and there very firsl 
appearance was a sell-out. 

As reported by Frank Lynch of the 
Evening News (Harrisburg. PA). "By 
the time Jim Hakim finishes, he has 
convinced most of the audience that he 
is in spirit, if not in fact, Jim Morrison. 

Tickets for the concert are S5 general

ity cards. The Sweet Shoppe in Walb

Hair 

New theatre presents play 



ByJoAnnStclnforth 
Features Editor 



The rock musical "Hair" celebrated 
is 25th anniversary and opened to a 
ellout crowd Friday, Ociober 1, at 8 
i.m. in the new Williams Theatre, 
yilh a speech by director Larry Life 
reception in Room 113 aftcr- 



Thc evening marked the official 
opening of Ihe new theatre, which 
named for the laic Ernie 
Williams, editor of the News- 
Sentinel from 1966 until be retired in 
1982. 

Gerald L. Ratliff, dean of Ihe school 
of fine and performing arts, intro- 
duced Larry Life lo the audience 
after the performance. 
"Tonight is Ihe formal dedication of 
this new facility for those that are 
here tonight and for those who will 
come later," said Ratliff. 

Ratliff also thanked faculty design- 
en Sleven T Sorratore and Craig A. 
Humphrey, for their work on the cos- 
Why choose Hair? When asked this 
question. Life answered by by saying 
that he chose Hair as a history lesson. 
Many people in the audience were 



nolbomyetin 1968. 

"We must challenge ourselves, wc 

arc an academic theatre, so we must 

pose difficult questions. I want to be 

challenging and show all facets of my 

art." added Life. 

In a different political climate, the 
casl recreated the lurhulcnt times era 
or the 60s. 

The play was a warm and funny 
look at ihe 60s and the main character 
of Claude, played by Jeff Schmidt 
bad to make the difficult personal 
decision of whether to bum bis draft 
cord, or remain with his friends in 

1968 New York City 

The brief, two minute nude scene 
marked the first act finale. The tribe 
members emerged from underneath a 
parachute, marking their "rebirth," 

Many people in the audience 
showed their enthusiasm for the play 
by wearing period clothing from the 
60s. One 18-year old remarked that 
the play was belter than he hod 
expected. 

Music was by Gall MacDcrmot and 
Sound Design by Tom Tempel. 
An exhibit of historic posters and 
"Flower Power Fashions" by Pam

DAY 13 

Two weeks until opening night. 
Rehearsals take on an even greater 
intensity. Word has il (from those who 
have worked on a Larry L. Life musical 
in the past) that ihe remaining 
rehearsals before opening night will 
become nol unlike a Marine boot camp. 
Rehearsal ends with the cast in bigh 
spirits, most of whom proceed to a 
local restaurant where the revelry con- 
tinues long into the night. It has been a 
hard three weeks and time lo unwind is 
long overdue. 
DAY 14-19 

The week has been a blur with each 



day running into another, It is the final 
week before run-lbroughs and dress 
rehearsals and is filled wilh final "fine* 
tuning" and visits from ibe local press. 
Mr. Bill Carlton of the News Sentinel, 
and Ms. Deb Noel from the Journal- 
Gazette have been on band to interview 
cast members and record observations 
for the feature stories which they will 

Additionally, both local newspapers 
have sent phoiographcrs lo lake the 
photographs, which will accompany 
those articles. Additional guests on 
band include the Dean of the School of 
Fine and Performing Arts. Gerald 
Ratliff, Dr. Louis Cantor from the 
1PFW History Department, and 
Professor Steve Sarralore, who is 
designing the set and lighting for our 

DA. Y2 .Q 
The final weeks begins. We are now 



running the play from beginning to end, 
complete wilh our live musical accom- 
panists. The stage is now occupied by 
true "flower children" as witnessed by 
the tears streaming down the faces of 
the cast members as the final number in 
the show, "The Flesh Failures/Let the 
Sunshine In." is sung. "We starve, look 
at one anolhcr, short of breath, walking 
proudly in our winters. ..facing a dying 
nations." The words ore understood by 
all. The sadness is felt by everyone. 
The dream that died can now be 
mourned by each member of the cast, 

What was lo be the "dawning of the 
Age of Aquarius" is now understood to 
have only become ihe sunset for the 
hopes and dreams of a generation who 
longed for a beticr world. A world of 
peace, love and harmony. 

With this being the end of these 
diaries we in the casl would reflect a 
moment for you on what this play has 



come to mean for each of us. While we 
each may have our own interpretation 
we would agree, I ihink, that in the 
words of John F. Kennedy, those young 
people of the 60s went forth and 
picked-up the torch thai had been 
passed with [be hope that the glow 
from that fire would truly light the 
world to a new age of peach and love 
among all peoples. And while that 
torch was extinguished and its fire gut- 
tered we hope that you might see our 
play and leave with these words from a 
song from another play about an ideal 
and a dream that could not exist, or 
would nol be allowed lo exisl in ihis 

"Don't let it be forgot 
That once there was a spot 
For one brief shining moment 
Thai was known as Camclot."

Journalist to speak 



Amnesty International hosted a dis- 
cussion with John Wheeler, a foreign 
correspondent with Associated Press on 
Tuesday, October 12(h at 7:30 p.m. 

Tbe meeting began with an introduc- 
tion to AI and included writing letters 
and was followed by Wheeler's discus- 

Whcclcr spent 15 years in Franco, 
Spain and was in Peru for 2 1/2 years 
during the rise of Ibc guerrilla terrorist 
group, "The Shining Path, " and wrote 
a book on this group. This resistance 
group followed the Maoist doctrine. 

Wheeler, who is now retired and lives 
in Wabash, Indiana was able to talk to 
a few guerilla's and report on their 
uprisings during that timeframe,. 

"The Shining Path's purpose was to 
overthrow the government, They start- 
ed in the highlands and have now 
expanded all over tbe country, Tbe 
guerrilla war in Peru started in 1980 
and bos seen three Peruvian presi- 
dents," said Wheeler. 

"The Peruvian courts are very 
crowded, and most peasants spend 
a long time in prison waiting for 
their trial. " said Wteeler. 



When he arrived in Peru in 1982, the 
count of political prisoners were known 
to be 259 and by the lime he left the 
country there were 5,000 missing or 
dead prisoners, mostly civilian pheas- 
ants. At tbe present, the sounl of miss- 
ing person's is reported to be up to 
20.000. 

"The Peruvian courts are very crowd- 
ed, and most peasants spend a long 
time in prison waiting for their trial," 
said Wheeler. 

As staled in the AI bylaws on human 
rights, their mission is to contribute to 
the campaign for human rights. 

Amnesty International defines human 
rights as every person deserves to be 
treated with dignity, to be safe and 
secure, and to have the means to meet 
basic needs of survival, such as decent 
food and shelter. 

When AI states that one person has 
human rights, we ore rally saying that

□tber persons have human responsibili- 
ties Each person bears the responsibili- 
ty of behaving toward other people in a 
certain way — each of us is obliged to 
respect the inherent human dignity of 

In other words, any appeal demanding 
respect Tor one person's human rights is 
really an appeal aimed at the behavior 
of olbero. 

Because of the specific rights Ibut AI 
seeks to protect, the organization's 
appeals arc aimed at the behavior of 
governments and of others who wield 
power. The movement insists that gov- 
ernments live up to their responsibility 
to safeguard Ibc security and to respect 
the dignity of human beings. AI calls 
on people everywhere to join with it in 
making this demand. 

Their mandate is summarized as fol- 
lows: Their work centers on particular 
grave violations of fundamental human 
rights. AI opposes imprisonment that 
violates every person's rights: and 
freely to hold and to express his or her 
convictions without resort to the use of 
advocacy of violence, and to be free of 
his or her ethnic origin, sex, color, or 
language. 

"Our goal is to write letters on behalf 
of three prisoners a month and the basic 
program is designed to introduce new 
people to AI," said Jane Martin 

'The program is expanding to include 
people who have been killed and did 
not receive a trial," said Martin. 

Josuc Njock-Lihii, an associate pro- 
fessor of Engineering and a native of 
Cameroon has been involved with AI 
for over a year. He has sent letters on 
behalf of political prisoners in Asia and 
Latin America. • 

"AI is a good organization and I 
believe has been effective in the release 
of some prisoners," said Njock-Libii.

donations and is completely indepen- 
dent of political influence.

Hcrmine J. van Nuis, associate profes- 
sor of English at IPFW and the recipi- 
ent of the 1990 Friends of IPFW 
Outstanding Teacher Award, is about to 
see an article she did on John Milton's 
poem "L' Allegro" published in the 
Milton Quarterly. 

The Milton Quarterly is the top jour- 
nal in its field and being published in 
such an internationally known journal 
is quite an honor. 

Professor van Nuis' interest in this 
particular poem came from her experi- 
ences with teaching. Her main teaching 
interests are seventeenth century lileta- 

In fact, she has done other publica- 
tions on literature of this lime. Van 
Nuis claims that no matter how often 
she teaches a certain topic or piece of 
literature she always hits upon new 
ideals and approaches. 

Her research and study on 
"L' Allegro" took over two years. The 
process of revising her article to satisfy 
various readers took a whole summer in 
itself. She started her search for publi- 
cation by sending bcr article to the top 
journals in the field and luckily, she 
claims, it was accepted by the Milton 
Quarterly 

However, her colleagues and students 
oil agree that is not mere luck that got 
van Nuis' work published, but her dedi- 
cation and sincere work.

"Profcssor van Nuis has a lively si 
of humor and is committed to her work 
and takes it very seriously. She dell- " 
nilely has a great love of literature," 
said Fred Kirchlioff, Chair of the eng- 
lish department. 

"Hcrmine is a fine teacher and out- 
standing scholar. She is very interesting 
and creative," said Judy Clinton, execu- 
tive director of University Relations. 

In her article, van Nuis takes a very 
unique, psychological approach to 
"L' Allegro." She challenges the criti- 
cisms of general literature critics by 
proving that "L' Allegro" is a much 
more subtle and difficult poem than its 
counterpart "II Tencroso." 

Van Nuis also takes pride in her Dutch 
heritage. This can be seen through her 
research and publication on Dutch liter- 
ature. She grew up in Holland during 
World War 11 and has lived there a 
number of years. She graduated from 
the University of Michigan, where she 
taught. Van Nuis also taught at Calvin 
College in Michigan. 

IPFW is honored to have such an 
extraordinary scholar and lover of liter-

Can't afford to save 
The truth is, you can't afford n 
Not when you realize that youi 
can last ao to 30 years or more. You'll want 
to live at least as comfortably then as you

By starting to save now, you can take 
advantage of tax-deferral and give your 
money time to compound and grow. 
Consider this: set aside just S100 each 
month beginning at age 30 and you can 
accumulate over $1154,031* by the time 
you reach age 65. But wait ten years and 
you'll have to budget $31 1 each month

Bulls star ends career 



By Aaron N. Thompson 
Sports Editor 

Well. Chicago Bulls fans, brace your- 
selves. 
The "god" of basketball has decided 
lo call il quits. Yeah, everybody knows 
who I'm talking about - Michael 
Jordan. 
Jordan has been the single most dom- 
inant figure in the sports world for 
quite some time now. His face has 
been plastered on the front of every- 
thing - cereal bones, t-shins, and hot 
dog commercials. His face and lilcc- 
bave almost been used to the 
point of downright absurdity. 
Every new player bos to he compared 
d him. No new guy can establish his 
iwn identity anymore; he has lo have 
similar attributes lo those of the "great. 

television had to 
le ground, didn't 
they? Il was always "Jordan is so great, 
Ltoppablc" and "be was totally 
off-balance when he shot that," even 
though he just shot an airball {I am nol 
g that Ibis happened a to), but 

was so blatant il was pathetic. ) 
For the past three years, it has been 
nothing bul Jordan, Jordan and more 
Jordan, 
I respect Michael Jordan with the 
highest amount of respect I can give a 
professional athlete. He was the greal- 
in Ihe history of professional 
basketball, and that includes Wilt 
Chamberlain. 
It was terrific lo walch him play 
iccause he liked to dunk and he 
seemed to glide on air. 
He has taken his team and himself to 
the limits by winning three consecutive 
NBA titles and all of those other 
awards and accolades that have been 
heaped upon him for ihc past nine 

However, this is all going (o come to 
screeching halt. 
Finally. 

Has anyone out (here in the media 
world ever considcrd that there are 
irld thai arc fans of the 
NBA that haven't been fans of Michael 

Just maybe, just suppose, that 
where in Portland. Oregon or maybe in 
Phoenix, Arizona, someone downright 
dislikes the guy. 

Just imagine thai just maybe someone 



doesn'l like (he Tact lhat 01 
royalties from a shoe have increased 
the price of tennis shoes by about S50. 

Maybe, just maybe, someone out 
(here would like lo eat a bowl of cere- 
al without seeing his face. Maybe 
somebody out there knows thai even if 
drink "Gatorade," you won't "Be like 
Mike." Maybe lhat same person is 
happy with the way that he is. and 
doesn"t even want lo "Be like Mike " 

Maybe somebody out Ibere would 
like to read an issue of Sports 
Illustrated during the NBA Playoffs 
and not sec Michael Jordan on Ibe 
cover every other week Is what he did 
so spectacular lhat it deserves Ibe 
cover? Doubt iL 

Maybe some fans aren't overly 
impressed about how arrogantly Ihc 
man played basketball, by how many 
times he shot the ball. 

Maybe someone out [here wanted 
someone else to be the winner. 

As hard as it is to say, I'm glad il is 
finally over. 

Everybody knows or will soon real- 
ize that the Bulls are not a very good 
team without Michael Jordan, They 
will probably slip quite a bit and will 
not "four-peat." 

Now people are going to have to 
look for new talent in the league to 
root for. and believe me, il's there. But 
people have been so blinded by Jordan 
and bis winning ways lo see them. 
This league is not going to go broke 
by any means without Michael Jordan 

Fans of Jordan arc probably sad or 
upset about his decision to call it a 
career. But wben someone lives in the 
public eye as much as Jordan has in 
the past nine years, it has lo slop. 

Jordan didn't have any privacy, he 
couldn't do anything without a camera 
following him around. He couldn't 
even mourn for his father at his funer- 
al without someone taking a picture. 
This privacy, or lack thereof, is the 
sole reason I believe for Ihe early 
retirement. 

So. to Bulls fans. I'm sorry, sort of. 
You've had your day in the sun, but 
life goes on, eh? 

To the rest of the league, like fans in 
Cleveland and Phoenix, congratula- 
s now officially your turn lo 
stand up and take the spotlight 

And last bul nol least, to Michael 
Jordan, enjoy your life and your 

But lei it be known thai you are 
the only one who is going to enjoy

Quarterback shuffling brings new element to NFL 



'93-V4 campaign 
dubbed as 'year 
of second string' 

By Aaron N. Thompson 
Sports Editor 



The NFL seasc 
•ort of. I mem, 
fixth week of tb 
*eventh, yet in 



lite v 



going onto the 
i sense o( the 



II wasn't so long ago when, a coach in 
the National Football League would 
play all of his quarterbacks in the prc&gt; 
season and then make his decision who 
his starter would be He then would 
itick with that starter throughout the 
entirety of the season through thick and 
thin unless he was injured. 
Well, my friends, limes are a 
changin'. 

People say that this is the year of the 
field goal thus far. They have valid rea- 
sons to believe this is true. For exam- 
ple, John Carney of the San Diego 
Chargers hit a record number of field 
goals consecutively, including five in 
one game. Fuad Rcveiz of the 
■Minnesota Vikings hit five in one 
game, and so did Scott Pelphrey of the 
Cincinnati Bengals. Please don't forget 
about Eddie Murray, cither. The long- 
time Detroit kicker that is now with Ihc 
Cowboys netted five through the 
uprights against Green Bay, 
As a matter of fact, through five 
games of this season, kickers were hit- 
ting an amazing eighty percent their 
field goals. The points scored on field 
goals were higher than the points 
scored on touchdowns. With the excep- 
tion of Lin Elliot of the Dallas 
Cowboysf who was subsequently giveD 
his walking papers,) the kickers in this 
league have been on fire. 
But the reason for this I bebeve goes 
much, much deeper than just more 



accurate kicks. 

It deals with exactly who is the one 
getting them in position. 

Folks, welcome to the NFL The 
league of opportunity and performance 

Welcome to the long awaited year of 
the second-string quarterback. 

What, you ask? b the league on strike 
again? 

Nope, not this time. What we're see- 
ing is a period of transition in the NFL. 
The transition from what it takes to win 
in the nineties as compared to what it 
look to win in the eighties. 

Let's start with the Cleveland 
Browns, since their story is probably 
the most unique and interesting. 

Their quarterback since 1983 has 
been Bcmie Kosar, who. for the most 
port has been a top-rate quarterback 
with an inadequate team. He is also 
very popular with the fans in 
Cleveland. Kosar has a side-armed 
throw and on accurate trigger, but for 
the most part, has been ineffective this 

The Browns acquired disgruntled for- 
mer Heisman winner Vinny Tcslaverde 
from the Tampa Bay Bucs. 
Testaverde's situation was somewhat 
similar to that of Kosar's - good QB, 



"Citizens of Cleveland can 
summarize. ..with one word 
— 'Kostaverde!' " 






Ho- 



, the 



: than the Browns could 



The important thing to remember here 
is that Kosar was named the starter in 
the preseason, no questions asked. 

Kosar is impressive in his first two 
starts, but struggles terribly in the first 
half of a game against the L.A. 
Raiders. So Kosar is replaced by 
Testeverde in the /second half. 
Testeverde rallies the team from a 16-0 
deficit and they win the game. 

Kosar is once again named the starter 
for the next gome against Indianapolis. 
The exact same scenario occurs. Kosar 
is ineffective and is yanked at bolftime. 
In comes Testeverde to rally the troops. 
The only difference this time is the fact 
that the Browns do not end up winning, 
but they did get back into the game

Many started to think that we had 
seen the end of Bemie Kosar as starter 
of the Cleveland Browns 

Nope, that didn't happen. During 
their bye week, the Browns extended 
Kosar's contract to seven more years 
worth well over S25 million. 

To put an even more unique twist to 
Ibis entire situation, Cleveland coach 
Bill Belicheck stated that he would 
continue to play both quarterbacks 
every game Kosar would start, and 
Testeverde would play the second half. 

Tbe result, you ask? Citizens of 
Cleveland can summarize the whole 
situation with one word 
"Kostaverde!" 

Yeah, whatever you say, guys. 

Well, I wouldn't be so skeptical about 
the idea if it weren't for the fact that it 
isn't panning out the way it's intended. 
Cleveland started out the season at 2-0 



indcr Kosar and 



1-2 



ith 



"Kostaverde" in action. What is hap- 
pening here is a lack of continuity 
here, and it is slowly tearing the 
Browns apart at the seams. 
The Browns are not the only team 
that is doing the quarterback shuffle. 
Look at the Indianapolis Colts this sea- 
Jeff George, who was last years 
starter and was going to be the starter 
this year, held out and lost his starting 
job to second-stringer Jack Trudeau, 
Trudeau has been a good quarterback 
for Indianapolis for several years but 
he is not a starter by any means. His 
performances have shown that this sea- 
son, as he is rated as the 24lh out of tbe 
28 starting quarterbacks this season. 
He has thrown for more interceptions 



than touchdowns and threw three pick- 
offs in the ir: half in a game against 
the Dallas Cowboys. He was then told 
to lake a scat and was replaced by Don 
Majkowski. who was also ineffective. 

My question 10 Colt coach Ted 
Marchibroda is, don't you think you've 
proven your point and punished 
George enough? Quit playing the sec- 
ond and third best guys, play the man 
of the future. 

Even perennial superstars are not 
exempt from getting yanked this sea- 
son. Warren Moon, who has thrown 
for more yardage than any other quar- 
terback in the history of football was 
pulled at half time once this season. It 
didn't do any good, because backup 
Cody Carlson couldn't move the team 
any better, but he did look better than 

Move on to San Diego, where last 
year Stan Humphries led the Chargers 
into tbe playoffs and had an 11-5 
record. He has been innately ineffec- 
tive also, so in moves Dan Friesz at 
balftimc and moves the offense much 
better. Friesz has now been named the 
starter over the struggling Humphries. 
Next go to Atlanta, where Ihc Falcons 
have already hit rock bottom. They 
started the season with Chris Miller as 
their starter, then he was yanked in a 
game and replaced by Bobby Hebert. 
Then Hebert was named the starter and 
was replaced by Billy Joe Tolliver in 
ihc third quarter of one game. 
Then you go to Tampa Bay. where 
Steve DeBerg started the first game for 
the Bucs, and then was replaced at 
halftime by Craig Erickson and was 
then named the starter Then be was 



replaced at halftime of the next game 
by DeBerg. 

Then look at the Washington 
Redskins. Mark Rypicn is hurt in tbe 
second game of the season and then the 
starting job is then handed over to Cary 
Conklin. Conklin starts one game for 
the Redskins and then is replaced in the 
third quarter by Rich Gannon, 
Next on the list are the Los Angeles 
Raiders. Jeff Hosteller was acquired in 
the offseason lo put some stability at 
the quarterback position for the 
Raiders. He suffers a slight back injury 
and is forced out of one game lo ensure 
that he comes back healthy. He then 
throws two interceptions against the 
Jets and is benched in place of of veter- 
an Vince Evans. Evans rallied the 
Raiders to victory as Hosteller watched 
on the sidelines. 

Another heated situation is the one 
that is occurring in Detroit. Coach 
Wayne Fontes can't seem lo decide 
which quarterback be is going to use. 
Rodney Peete was the starter at the 
beginning of the season, and after three 
games was demoted to third-string. 
Then the starter was Andre Ware, wbo 
has one good game then one not-so- 
good game. He is then replaced at half- 
time by Erik Kramer, who led tbe Lions 
to the NFC Championship Game. He 
was also ineffective, therefore Peete 
was named as the starter again. 
What we have here arc coaches that 
are in a big hurry to solve a problem. 
They want to deflect the blame from 
themselves in an effort to put the pres- 
sure on the starter. 
Competition is a good thing. It keeps 
the starters from getting too relaxed and 
keeps them working. However, they 
need a little job security. Why? 
Because too much pressure leads to 



the quarterback constantly looking over 
his shoulder and playing tentatively. He 
is unable to go out and make things 
happen in fear that he might get yanked 
at balftimc. 

If you notice, all of ihc above teams 
arc really struggling this season, and I 
don't believe for one minute that the 
only reason thai these teams are strug- 
gling arc their quarterbacks. 

As a mailer of fact, if there was a way 
to pinpoint the problem, I'd say that the 
main problem for these teams is a lack 
of continuity. The same players aren't 
being allowed to slay out on the Held 
together and gel used to one another. 
Leadership is not being developed. 

Why is Ihis transition taking place? 
Blame the Buffalo Bills last year. 

Trailing 35-3 in tbe third quarter, 
Frank Reich, the second string quarter- 
back for ihc Bills, engineered one of 
the greatest comebacks in the history of 
sports by defeating the Houston Oilers 
41-35 in overtime. He produced a spark 
of rejuvenation for second stringers 
everywhere. 

Now bead coaches ore calling on their 
second. stringers to duplicate Reich's, 
performance and produce a spark for 
their team. 

What they are getting are second-! 
siring quarterbacks making second- 
string decisions and are eventually] 
resulting in losses, nol sparks. 
C'mon guys, stop this nonsense. The 1 
fans aren't ready for the likes of, 
"Kostaverde." They wonl you to decide' 

on a guy and keep him in there. Fans 

develop a respect for the player who is 

always in there. 
Let your starter be the flint lo produce, 

the spark. Give him a little confidence 

and he'll give you the continuity; 

you've been looking for.
