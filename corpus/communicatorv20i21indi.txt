Adopt shorter semester

From Monday's debate in the 

best course of action would be to

longer study and not tor academic

The case for a 15-week semester 
is solid. From information in- 
troduced during floor debate it

In addition the entire Purdue 
system is on the longer 16-week 
calendar. 

The case made by some of the 
Purdue faculty members is not

While almost ihm- hlilr, &lt;&gt;i th&lt;-

16-week calendar, the arguments 
made by the minority are too pow- 
erful to be ignored.

say that the shortening of the 
semester would reduce "
