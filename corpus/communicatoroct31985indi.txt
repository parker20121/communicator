Senate drops resolution 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 
After meeting with Purdue President 
Steven Bereing and Indiana President 
John Ryan, the faculty senate decided 
to revoke the resolution concerning a 
search and screen committee proposed 
at their Sept. 9 meeting. 

The resolution asked the two 
presidents to appoint a majority of the 
committee members from a faculty 
panel elected by the IPFW faculty- 
Further, the resolution ensured a 
balanced make-up on the committee. It 
asked each academic unit be equally 
represented, and representatives from 
the community, the alumni, the 



students, the administrative staff, and 
the clerical and service staff be equally 
represented. 

When Evangelos Coufoudakis, 
associate professor of political science, 
was asked why the resolution was 
dropped, Coufoudakis said the faculty 
was satisfied with what the presidents 
told them. 

"Basically, we had a meeting with 
the presidents (Ryan and Beering) in 
which they outlined the procedures," 
Coufoudakis said. 

He added Ryan assured them the 
committee would be selected fairly. 
"We'd like to take the president of IU at 
his word," said Coufoudakis. 

However, when Coufoudakis was

asked if the presidents explained the 
procedure of selecting a committee, 
Coufoudakis said "No." 

However, Coufoudakis indicated the 
faculty senate had not forgotten the 
importance of selecting a search and 
screen committee. 

"Our concerns are still there ., this 
(dropping of the resolution) does nol 
preclude any further action by the 
senate," Coufoudakis said.

cellor, was unavailable for comment. 

Program 
assesses 
older 
individuals 

By DEBORAH A. ST ARKS 
Chief Reporter 

The Health Assessment of the Older 
Individual is a successful new program 
being sponsored through the Continuing 
Education School of Nursing at Purdue 
University, West Lafayette, Indiana. 

Barbara Miller, an instructor in 
nursing, and Marsella Smith, an RNC, 
and an associate professor, both of the 
School of Nursing at Purdue Univer- 
sity, are pioneers in this new concept in 
health care for the aging. 

"Our program was started last 
spring at the Veterans' Home in 
Lafayette, Indiana. At the request of 
the Indiana State Board of Health, a 
second program was begun in 
Columbus, Indiana," said Miller. 

"Because of the success of those two 
programs, one is now being offered at 
the Miller's Merry Manor in Hun- 
tington, Indiana, the originator of the 
seed money for this project," said 
Miller- 
Registered nurses who are interested 
in finding out about the older individual 
are enrolled in a ten-week course which 
meets one day a week. They are given a 
pretest to determine how much they 
know about elderly people 

The course consists of lectures, video 
slides, tapes, and hands-on experience 
in learning how to assess what is in the 
normal range for older people as far as 
skin, eyes, heart, muscle systems, ears, 
noses, and throats are concerned. 

At the end of the course, nurses are 
given a post-test to see how much they 
have gained from their experiences. 
They also earn twenty to forty credit 
units from the Continuing Education 
Department at Purdue. 

"They are also asked to go out into 
nursing homes, public housing units, 
and other facilities to validate the 
health of older persons. If problems are 
discovered, referrals are made toother 
agencies," said Miller. 

"There is a great need to teach 
nurses how to make good inspections of 
older people. Many nurses don't have 
the information needed to be able to 
assess the physiological changes in 
older persons," said Smith. 

"There is a need for this information 
in the general population. Misguided 
information needs to be made clear," 

said Miller. 

"We tell people about our program 
whenever we can," said Smith. "Health 
Assessment of the Older Individual is 
the only program of its kind in the state 
or Indiana. We have had some inquiries 
from the state of Illinois," said Miller. 

"We have found this program to be 
extremely rewarding," said Smith. "I 

can see this course being offered as an 
elective in the future for nursing 
students." 

"This will be the way of the future 
because older people are living longer 
now," added Miller. The program has 
been accredited by the Indiana State 
Nursing Association . 

For further information concerning 
the Health Assessment of the Older 
Individual, contact the Continuing 
Education School of Nursing at Purdue 
University, West Lafayette.

Changes in aid create problems 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

Students at IPFW and at other 
colleges are facing problems in ob- 
taining federal aid due to recent 
changes, said Richard M. Bellows, 
associate director of the financial aid 
department. 

"New regulations came out the 
second week of July," said Bellows. 
' 'but college officials did not realize the 
significance of these changes until a 
few weeks ago." 

"We usually have aid packages 
calculated by August," said Bellows, 
"when the guidelines were changed, we 
had to start re- calculating aid awards 
for most of the students," 



Actual funding levels (or the various 
programs have not changed much, said 
Bellows. "The big change this year is 
the additional paperwork needed to 
validate sludenl applications." 

Bellows expects to have all awards 
finalized during the next three or four 
weeks. "We are extending the fee 
deadline until Oct. 17 for Pell and 
Guaranteed Student Loan applicants," 
said Bellows. 

While a breakdown of federal aid 
awards is not available at this time, 
Bellows estimated the number of full- 
time and part-time students receiving 
Pell grants this semester will be 1500- 



Bellows does not expect Congress to 
cut the amount of student aid available 
for the 1986-87 school year, however 
Congress is reviewing who should be 
eligible for aid. 

"The federal government is making 
it more difficult for the traditional 
college student Hinder 22 years) to 
obtain independent student status, but 
easier for the older student who is at- 
tending college after working several 
years," said Bellows. 

Financial aid guidelines for the 1986- 
87 school year will he established by 
January, 1986, said Bellows, and 
students should plan to attend the 
federal aid workshops. 



Suicide common in young adults 



By KELLI KIRKPATRICK 
Stall Writer 

Editor's Note : This is the first of a 
three part series. 

As Kathy laid on her stomach 
across the bed, she fingered the 
little red pills as though they were 
pebbles of gold. As her blue 
fingertips turned, squeezed and 
flipped the sleeping pills, tears 
flowed down her cheeks, landing 
softly on the pillow. 

"I didn't really want to die, I just 
wanted to start over. I wanted 
things to get better and the pain to 
go away. But I didn't really want to 
die," remembers Kathy. 

Life had become so unbearable 
for the 21-year-old, with problems 
mounting endlessly, that she "just 
couldn't take it anymore." The pills 
looked like the way out. 

At age 15, Kathy first overdosed 
on heart pills and blood pressure 
regulatory pills. She went into 
cardiac arrest and nearly died. She 
said at the time she didn't even 
realize what kind of medication she 
was swallowing — only that it was 
easy to obtain since it was her 
parents', and there were "bottles 
and bottles." 

At age 18, Kathy again overdosed, 
but this lime on packages of diet 
pills. Her stomach was pumped and 
she spent several days in bed. 

At age21, Kathy overdosed for the 
third time on anti-depressant 
medication. She became comatose 
for two days and remained in 
critical intensive care at Parkview 
Memorial Hospital for a week. 

Kathy's still alive, but struggling 
with chronic depression. 

Unfortunately attempted suicides 
like Kathy's are not uncommon, 
especially among young people 
between the ages of 15 and 24. 
National statistics reveal between 
1950 and 1980, suicide has risen by 11 
percent overall. Among young 
people, it climbed by an alarming 
300 percent. Around 7,000 teenagers 
are reported to kill themselves each 
year, and over 400,000 attempt 
suicide. 

Last year, 32 suicides occurred in 
Allen County. Four of those were 




teen deaths, according to the Allen 
County coroner's report 

Switchboard crisis hotline 
counselor Judy ( who requested her 
last name be withheld) said a lot of 
suicide calls come during the 
holidays or before final exams. She 
said teenagers and young adults are 
high risks for suicide attempts, and 
people over the age of 55 are high 
risks because "the higher the age 
range, the more likely they are to 
succeed." 

Men in their early 20's are "more 
apt to commit suicide because they 
use more violent means, like 
shooting themselves with a gun," 
she said Females use less violent 
means, like overdosing, and suc- 
ceed less often. 

Other high risks include 
alcoholics, homosexuals, drug 
addicts, terminally ill patients, 
psychotics and Vietnam veterans, 
according to Judy. 

"There are a lot of reasons why a 
person would choose lo take their 
life. It's not just one incident. It's a 
lot of things happening that the 
person feels they have no control 
over. Maybe their parents are 



considering a divorce or they broke 
up with a boy- or girlfriend or 
they've moved to another city." 

"The caller (Call For Help 
hotline) feels like there are no 
choices. They've come up against a 
brick wall and they don't see any 
alternatives. This is particularly 
true with teenagers because older 
people have lived longer and have 
seen more choices. We try to find 
possible allerna lives to coping other 
than suicide, We talk about all the 
things the person has to live for and 
let them know how others, friends 
and family, would feel about their 
loss. A Jot of times a person just 
wants lo be around for their 
children," she said. 

But sometimes offering alter- 
natives doesn't help. "Sometimes 
the person will say, 'You can't help 
me!' and hang up. And you never 
know what they're going to do after 
they hang up. But that person has a 
choice. There's only so much we can 
do," Judy said. 

On Thursday, the Continuing 
Education department will sponsor 
a lecture on teenage suicides at 9 
a.m. in Walb Memorial Union, room 
21 and 21 A.

HPER commitment still 
important to IPFW 



The Student Senate proposed a 
resolution concerning the dropping of 
Health, Physical Education &amp; 
Recreation (HPER) classes from the 
fall, 1985, schedule, at their meeting on 
Wednesday, Sept. 25. 

The resolution stated "a 'protected' 
HPER offerings escrow account be 
established in the Division at Education 
with a $5,000 minimum ... or that HPER 
,,. be transferred back to the Athletic 
Department for its administration and 
well-being." 

We applaud the Student Senate's 
effort, but we are upset with the 
response from Dr Edward A. Nicholson, 
acting chancellor. 

In a letter to Jill Adamson, student 
senator, Nicholson stated he is sorry 
about the incident, but there was just not 
enough funding. 

Not enough funding? What happened 
to the $5,000. the original amount given 
for HPER by the vice chancellor's 
office? What about the fact that HPER 
classes are traditionally money 
makers? HPER classes ore closed at 
capacity early in registration each 
semester. 

However, this semester, after a good 
number of the classes were filled, the 
administration cancelled all of them, 
causing considerable inconvenience to 
students. Do you administrators 
remember the absolute pain it is to go 
through filling out a drop-add card? We 
think not. 

However, we do recognize the 
administrators appreciation of the 
students' concern about health. But that 
excuse doesn't work in this instance. 

HPER classes offer students an 
opportunity to do many things. 

First of all, students could begin a 
major in the Health. Physical Education 
and Recreation field, under the guidance 
of Indiana University. 

Secondly, the HPER classes offer 
students a chance of maintaining 
physical fitness and wellness. 



Thirdly, the classes offer a break in 
the normal, day-to-day stress of 
academic classes. 

Other institutions of higher education 
recognize this need and continually 
provide the opportunity to take HPER 
classes. Sure, IPFW is not a normal, 
residential college campus. People have 
other outside activities — that is more 
reason to maintain the HPER courses 

Most of all, we are upset with the 
administration's seemingly "couldn't 
care less" attitude about their promise 
made years ago to "provide a co- 
educational facility to conduct physical 
education classes, both service and 
professional." 

That promise verbally sold the idea of 
building a multi-purpose building here 
on campus. Now our administration has 
gone back on their word ... almost, We 
say almost because HPER classes are 
still offered, but only sparingly An 
undergraduate first aid class, hper H160, 
a two-credit hour course, and HPER 
H519 and HPER P545, two graduate 
courses, continue to be offered. 

If this is called promoting physical 
fitness and wellness, as well as a HPER 
program, we feel sorry for those people 
who thought this one up. 

It's not too late to get things back in 
order for next spring HPER classes in 
golf, tennis, badminton, handball, 
volleyball, physical fitness and 
gymnastics are part of the academic 
programs stressed in the Architectural 
Building Program for the Multipurpose 
Building. It is essential not another 
semester goes by without offering the 
HPER classes. 

This program needs to be protected 
and the administration must not use it as 
the budget reduction scapegoat every 
time they need to cut back on 
expenditures. 

If this IU program is lost, the score is 
Purdue, one: Indiana, zero. Which 
program is next, sirs?

'Wanna Race? 

To the Editor: 

Anybody ever hear of 
sculling? Sculling is boating 
on a long flat rowboat 
propelled by sculls (oars) 
which are muscled by one or 
more team members, 

Boston's Harvard 
University has an annual 
sculling event on the nearby 
St. Charles River. Student's 
Government thinks IPFW 
needs an annual "bis event", 



How about boa! racing on the 
St. Joseph River? Team 
members could practice and 
compete virtually right on 
campus. A sculling weekend 
could take- place every 
spring (or fall) Think of the 
crowds and parties that 
might happen. What do you 
think? "Little 500" can't be 
the last word in traditional 
"crazy" weekends! 

Perhaps a canoe race 
instead? Are there any 
canoeing enthusiasts 



amongst us? A two person 
plus one passenger canoe 
race might become as 
popular as the Three Rivers 
Festival's Bed Race. 

Let's get some ideas off the 
ground, (and into the water) 
... How 'bout it — wanna 
race? 

Interested persons please 
contact Student Government 
in Walb, room 225.

Student Body President 



Woman chancellor 
a possibility 



To The Editor: 

Now that the time has 
come for the appointment of 
a new chancellor for the 
IPFW campus may I suggest 
that the time is right for a 
woman to fill thai position? 
Such an appointment would 
certainly give credibility to 



this university's com- 
mitment affirmative action. 
Better yet — why not a black 



Affirmative Action Corn- 



Much to our disappointment, the 
(acuity senate has decided not to pass a 
resolution declaring specifications for a 
search and screen committee. 

At a faculty senate meeting on Sept. 9, 
some faculty members expressed great 
concern over the process of selecting a 
search and screen committee. As a 
result, the resolution was authored to 
ensure an equal representation of 
community, alumni, students, 
administrative staff, and clerical and 
service staff would be present on the 
committee. 

The resolution also asked President 
Steven Beering, of Purdue University, 
and President John Ryan, of Indiana 
University, to appoint a majority of 
committee members from a faculty 
panel selected b« IPFW faculty. 



When we spoke to Evangelos 
Coufoudakis on Tuesday, he said after 
the faculty met with both presidents, 
they decided the procedures were fair 
and sufficient Coufoudakis also said the 
faculty would "like to take the president 
of IU at his word." What about the 
president of Purdue? 

One bright spot in this grayness is this 
decision by the faculty senate to drop the 
resolution does not preclude future 
action by the senate. 

That outlet is recommended because 
we feel specific guidelines are needed 
for the presidents to follow. 

In conclusion, we regret the faculty 
declined to press the resolution further. 
We suggest the faculty be constantly 
aware of what is going on in the selection 
process.

Larrabee travels the world promoting peace 




By EARL SMITH 

Chief Reporter 

Kent Larrabee is a retired 

social worker who is working 

for peace. 

"Although many 

Americans fear a nuclear 
holocaust and a large 



segn 



int of the U.S. 



population sincerely believes 
the Russians are evil, anti- 
religious people, I found 
them to be just as concerned 
about peace. I also 
discovered a revival taking 
place in the Christian 
Church," said Larrabee. 

Larrabee' s view developed 
after extensive travel in the 
Soviet Union during 19S2 and 
1964. 

A member of the Religious 
Society of Friends (Quaker!, 
Larrabee has been involved 
in Quaker peace and social 
concerns activities ap- 
proximately 40 years, His 



visit to the Fort Wayne area 
was organized by the Fort 
Wayne and Maple Grove 
Friends Meetings. 

Larrabee recently 
presented a 100-slide lecture 
to a Russian foreign policy 
class at IPFW, telling many 
positive aspects of Soviet 
culture. 

Larrabee was amazed by 
the friendliness and 
hospitality extended to him 
by the Soviet people. "1 
asked a man one day why I 
was treated so well when we 
were supposed to be 
enemies," said Larrabee. 
"He replied, "We make a 
sharp distinction between 
the American government 
and the American people.'" 

Larrabee's first visit to 
Russia came at the end of a 
2,300 mile peace walk 
through Great Britain, 
Western Europe, and

Guest Writer 

Last semester, the Council 
for Recognition of Disabled 
Student Services recognized 
and honored five outstanding 
professors who dedicated a 
great deal of time and help to 
the needs of disabled 
students at IPFW Those 
professors recognized with 
certificates of appreciation 
were William G. Frederick, 



Barbara J Koch, Jane L. 
Harris, Pamela L. Krompak, 
and Fane T. Heine. 

Fane Heine was given 
special honors as the most 
outstanding professor and 
was awarded an engraved 
plaque along with the cer- 
tificate. This plaque is 
located in the teachers' 
lounge in Kettler Hall and 
lists all previous winners. 



Take the first step toward involvement: 
Senate and SUBOG positions open 



Everyone settled into their 
classes? Are your student 
calendars filled with marks 
which denote test and 
project due dates? Uh-huh! I 
thought as much. 

Now that we all have had 
the opportunity to size-up our 
personal schedules, perhaps 
we should turn our attention 
toward our membership 
(citizenship, if you will! of 
this university -IPFW. 

Have you ever felt like a 
small cog in an enormous 
machine? Have you ever felt 
as if you, as a student, had 
little control over campus 
matters? If so - DON' T! 
Feelings of self -actualization 
are within your grasp. 

Now, c'mon, I'm serious! 
Student Senate, although 
barely half-full, has already 
generated three resolutions 
this year. Issues concerning 
the funding and location of 
the proposed fine arts 



building, the last-minute 
cancellation of campus 
HPER classes, and the in- 
ternal affairs of Student 
Government itself have been 
addressed. These student 
recommendations have been 
routed to specific faculty 
members and the chan- 
cellor's office. Talk about 
expressing your opinionF 

SUBOG, although un- 
derstaffed, has put together 
an exciting film series, a 
major concert featuring the 
Tommy Dorsey Band at the 
Grand Wayne Center, 
several student trips such as 
one to Bloomington for the 
Oaken Bucket game, and 
many other events. Even so, 
SUBOG needs your talent to 
help plan spring semester 
activities and co-sponsored 
events. 

Student Senators and 
SUBOG officers are no 



different than you. They are 
individuals, with many 
outside responsibilities, all 
working toward college 
degrees. Perhaps there is 
one difference. They are 
active members of their 
campus. They take personal 
time and convert it to per- 
sonal pride through campus 
involvement. 

Student Senate includes 
Joseph Motherwell, 
president of the student 
body, Brad Miller, vice 
president, and senators Gina 
Kostoff, Maria Samson, 
Brett Pippin, Sandra Flum, 
Patrick Patrick, Kevin 
Kurtz, Jill Adamson, Julia 
Knisley, and James Hilaire. 
Senate officer position 
holders, filled by non- 
senators, include Nancy 
Williams, treasurer. The 
other positions of 

parliamentarian, clerk, and 
sargeant-at-arms are ur 



filled, as are nirje senator 
seats. 

SUBOG chairperson is 
Lisa Sewell, and assistant 
chairperson is Donnette 
Blanks SUBOG members 
include Lisa Buckles, Don 
Gorney, LeeAnn Fredrick, 
Vicki Kerlin. Steve Wise, 
Kristin Kellems and Andrea 
Sytsma. Six SUBOG seats 
are open, with five executive 
seats free. 

So ... how about you? Will 
you "be involved''" Come 
join us! You'll be glad you 
did! 

— Senate weekly meeting: 
Wednesday nights, 9 p.m. 

— SUBOG "weekly 
meeting: times are posted in 
Student Government office. 

— All meetings take place 
in the Student Government 
office, located on the second 
floor of the Walb Memorial 
Union Building.

Scandanavia. He returned in 
1984 to visit other cities in the 
southern and eastern parts 
of the Soviet Union. 

"I realize the problems 
between our governments 
are intricate, complicated, 
and sensitive, but I am 
convinced we cannot close 
our eyes to these problems," 
said Larrabee. "Our two 
governments combined have 
6,000 times as much fire 
power as was used during all 
of World War II, " Larrabee 
said. 

The concern for peace is 



very strong in the Soviet 
Union, said Larrabee 
"Almost every Russian 
family lost someone during 
World War II. As a result 
each worker gives one day's 
pay to the work of the local 
peace committee, "Larrabee 
said. 

Larrabee was surprised to 
discover a revival in the 
Christian Church. "I at- 
tended the Moscow Baptist 
Church one Sunday, ex- 
pecting maybe 300 people," 
said Larrabee, "To my 
surprise the church was 



packed, about 1,400 people 
had jammed into the san- 
ctuary and another 300 list- 
ening through a closed- 
circuit hook-up " 

Larrabee's moat 

memorable experience 
occurred one afternoon In 
Leningrad. He had taken 20 
peace leaflets which 
discussed the importance of 
nuclear disarmament Into 
Russia with him. When he 
passed the first leaflet, the 
young man took it, stopped 
and Immediately started 
reading it. Soon others were 
reading it also. 



Alumni given benefits 



Becoming a member of 
either the Indiana University 
Alumni Association or the 
Purdue Alumni Association 
at Fort Wayne may seem 
difficult at first, but once you 
master that first step, there 
are lots of added pluses. 

"In order to be eligible to 
join either local association, 
you must first join the main 
society at Indiana University 
at Bloomington or Purdue 
University at West 
Lafayette. That entitles you 
then to join one of the 
associations at IPFW," said 
Vivian Lansky, alumni 
director at IPFW 



There are yearly dues 
which include a paid sub- 
scription to one of the alumni 
monthly magazines. There 
are also special events for 
alumni and their families, 
and invitations to special 
programs. 

Each alumni association 
has its own board of six 
elected members at large, 
one representative from 
each academic division 
serves three year terms on 
each board. There are also 
four officers elected to one 
year terms on each board. 

"This year alumni were 
offered special subscription 



tickets to PIT Theater and 
fitness classes at reduced 
prices," said Lansky. 

"For the future, alumni 
will be given extended 
library privileges for 
members only," said Lan- 
sky. 

There are thirty-five 
events planned throughout 
the year for members of 
either the Indiana University 
Alumni Association or the 
Purdue Alumni Association 
at Fort Wayne.

'Dinosauer Olympics' 



By GARY LACY 
Staff Writer 

Air dancers. Pterodactyls, 
and dinosaurs from 
Hollywood are pari of the 
many ■ family activities 
taking place during 
Dinosaur Days at the Field 
Museum in Chicago on 
Saturday and Sunday from 
11 a.m. to 4 p.m. The ac- 
tivities will feature 
everything from living 
fossils to dinosaur tracking. 

Highlighting the weekend 
is the Multi gravitational 
Aerodance Group — an 
ensemble of dancers with 
choreography extending 
dance into the realm of the 
air Aerodance swings, 
leaps, and soars in imitation 
of prehistoric flying reptiles 
known as Pterosaurs. This 
dance will start at 2 p.m. on 
both Saturday and Sunday. 

Aerodance uses aerial 



structures to free them- 
selves from dancers' usual 
orientation to the floor. They 
move freely through tight- 
ropes, trapezes, slides, and 
hoops, achieving (he dan- 
cers' ultimate dream of 
flight. Working within these 
structures, Aerodance will 
swing and glide through the 
air in a graceful dance about 
prehistoric life on earth. 

The family can join in a 
game of "Dinosaur Olym- 
pics," explore "Living 
Fossils" of turtles and 
crocodiles, see dinosaur 
holograms, or build a Junk- 
o-Saurus from everyday 
trash. The adventurous can 
carve a dinosaur footprint, 
learn about a dinosaur's 
social behavior, and make a 
slegosaurushat. 

For more information on 
these events, contact the 
Field Museum in Chicago, 
Illinois.

Teaching does not end here 



By M. KATHLEEN GBEVEN 
Features Editor 

Stop and think right now. How many people have you in- 
teracted with today? 

Did their behavior influence you? Was an original idea, 
irom which you both learned, presented during the ex- 
change? 

This is not an original thought on my part, but an idea 
presented by Paul Morimanno, TPFW senior and French lab 
instructor. 

"Teaching is not just a textbook experience — it's a role 
that transcends the classroom setting," explained Mori- 
manno. 

Next semester, he will do his required student teaching, 
"God willing!" then graduate in May with a Bachelor of 
Science degree in Education, majoring in French with a 
minor in English. 

When asked how he became interested in teaching as a 
profession at a time when educators are not in high demand, 
he credited his own high school teachers as role models. 

"My (high school) teachers were always there to lend 
moral support, encouragement— whatever was needed, "he 
said, "and now, I'm in a position to do that for others. I feel 
good about that!" 

Morimanno's feelings about teaching are evident as he 
springs into action during one of four Fill labs he conducts 
each week. 

He is unfailingly patient with his fledgling French 
students. If a student requests to meet the great "cham- 
pignon-" (mushroom). when "champion" (Hero) is a more 
appropriate choice, he never snickers at the faux pas. ... 

Morimanno may .flash a conspiratorial smile, repeat, 
enAnglais, what the student said and gently suggest the 
substitution. 

"Tout le monde!" should have a familiar ring to it for 
Morimanno's students. They hear that command and it's 
companions, "Repetez, s'il vous PLAIT!" and "Ensemble! " 
repeatedly throughout class. 

"This lab is participation oriented I want to make French 
more real to my students. We practice asking each other 
questions as well as going over grammar points and 
vocabulary." 

Through those information exchanges, the class knows 
who lives in Bluffton, who lives in a blue house, and how 
many siblings are underfoot in that blue house in Bluffton. 

However, not all students eagerly volunteer such pertinent 
information. Some seem content to literally sit on their 
hands, but they don't get away with it for long. Marimanno

coaxes them into participating by questioning them about 
their family "chat ou chien, en francais," and pretty soon, 
they're an active part of the group. 

"Active," accurately describes his lab sessions and life 
beyond the university. Morimanno works at a full time job, 
carries a full load of classes, sets aside time to share with his 
five and one-naif year old son, plus plays the organ at his 
church three nights a week. 

"My father is a minister. I've been involved with playing 
the piano or organ at his church since I was 11 — I've grown 
upwiththemusic." 

With such a hectic schedule, when does he find time to 
study the humns for his church services? "Well, I don't," he 
confessed. "I've never learned to read music — I play by 
ear." 

This educated ear is probably why Morimanno con- 
sistently earns "A's" in his French classes, has the cer- 
tificates to prove he's been on the Vice-Chancellor's list, and 
has been awarded a French scholarship by the department 
of modern foreign languagesl 

We should all be so lucky. 

Although teaching French is high on his list of priorities, 
Morimanno's goal does not end in the classroom. "I think 
teaching acts as a bridge for helping other people. It doesn't 
have to involve grammar and counting — teaching can in- 
volve an entirely different lifestyle." 

Morimanno is interested in becoming an ambassador in 
France. It's a logical outgrowth of the classroom teaching 
experience. An ambassador's job is to be a professional role 
model, requiring the ability to work well with people and to 
possess a philanthropic orientation — all qualities demanded 
of a teacher. SU 

"When 1 dream, I dream big, but try to make those dreams 
come true. There are a lot of little goals between here and 
there." 

Morimanno's immediate dream, although sometimes 
convinced it's a nightmare, is being realized in May, when he 
graduates. 

What's the first thing he intends to do after graduation? 
Sleep for a week? Sell all of his books back to the friendly and 
helpful people at Follett's? Lounge around in the geogarden 
and laugh while the rest of us fight for one parking place 
rumored to exist? 

"I'm sending myself to France. That's my next goal. I'm 
ready! I have my tickets at home and I got my passport 
pictures laken today! Morimanno beams — or is it gloating? 
When one is insanely jealous, it's sometimes hard to tell the 
difference. 

And what is his secret for being an overachiever? At this 
point, he becomes very serious. Lowering his voice, he leans 
forward to divulge words of wisdom. "Coffee," he whispers, 
"lots of it!"

ganization affiliated with 
American Public Radio will 
present "A Prairie Home 
Companion," one of the most 
popular radio programs in 
existence, Saturday at 6 p.m. 

Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, 
described as the little town 
time forgot, the town 
decades cannot improve, 
where all the women are 
strong, and all the men are 
handsome, and all the 
children are above average, 
broadcasts the show each 
Saturday evening. 

Lake Wobegon is the 
location of Jack's Auto 
Repair, a place frequently 
mentioned on the show. If 
you ever have car trouble, 
you should Immediately call 



Jack's Auto Repair, "Where 

the bright Dashing lights 
show the way to complete 
satisfaction," 

Of course, Jack's isn't the 
only shop in Lake Wobegon. 
There's Berthas Kilty 
Boutique, Bob's Bank, 
Skogland's Five and Dime 
("where you really do find 
things that cost a nickel), the 
Chatterbox Cafe; Arts Baits 
and Night 0' Rest Tourist 
Cabins, the Sidetrack Tap 
owned by Wally and Evelyn, 
(who admonish visitors), 
"Don't sleep in our bar, we 
don't drink in your bed"), 
and Ralph's Pretty Good 
Grocery. 

Other personalities 
presented on the show are 
Pastor tnguist of the local 
Lutheran Church, Mary 
Gint Buasen, Constables 
Gary and LeRoy, Herald 
Starr, editor of the local 
newspaper, Senator Knute 
Thorvaldson, and Dr. and 
Mrs. Marva Newt. 



The program was formed 
by host Garrison Keillor, in 
1974 At that bme, Keillor 
was trying to support his 
family by free-lance writing, 
but wasn't very successful 
due to a problem common 
among writers: stupor. 

"You can sit in an empty 

room and look at blank paper 
for only so long before your 
eyes glaze over and your 
mind turns to lemon 
meringue," said Keillor, who 
started the show as a form of 
recreation. The native 
Minnesota!! adds his writing 
kept him honest, while 
performing kept him sane. 

Some of his more 

humorous pieces have been 
published in The New Yorker 
and he is also a frequent 
contributor to Atlantic 
Monthly. His first book of 
humorous pieces, "Happy to 
Be Here," became a best- 
seller. "Lake Wobegon 
Days," his second novel, is 



mtly 



i the best seller 



The program has changed 
a great deal since it went 
national In 1980, Keillor says 
He feels before the change 
the show was loo loose and 
"Two hours is too long for a 
bunch of casual performers 
to lounge around on the air, 
the way we used to in Lake 
Wobegon." 

A question many listeners 
usually find themselves 
asking is, "Where is Lake 
Wobegon, Minnesota?" Well, 
to this question there may 
not be an answer, even 
Keillor doesn't know if such 
a town really exists. He 
made up the city to put 
distance between the real 
life situations he sometimes 
uses and the people involved 

Then again, there may be 
a Lake Wobegon, he adds. 
"Maybe they're up there 
right now, sitting around in 
the Chatterbox Cafe eating 
Powdermilk Biscuits," 



Karns is new forensic coach 



By BRENDA GRAVES 
Staff Writer 

When discussing the term "forensics," one usually 
imagines a qualified medical examiner skillfully performing 
his duties after a person has died. 

Bui the term forensics means much more than that. To 
Vicki Karns, new coach of the Forensics team at IPFW, 
forensics means discovering which person on the team 
has a better, or best, argument when presenting an issue. 

Karns, a native of St. Joe, Michigan, is in her first year at 
IPFW as an instructor in the communication and theatre 
department. She is also the coach of the Forensics League 
She feels great fondness for the art of public speaking and 
has considerable experience in that area. 

Coming to Fort Wayne with a Bachelor of Arts degree 
from Anderson College in Speech, Business Administration 
and Music, Karns also has a Master of Arts from Ball State 
in theatre and speech She's had experience with the IPFW 
Forensics League as a result of previous competition with 
the group. 

Karns is now enthusiastically pursuing a Ph.D. in com- 
munication and theatre from Wayne State in Detroit, 
Michigan. 



In talking with the new Forensics coach, it is easy to see 
she helps what most people see as a difficult task to become 
a little easier, "Most people are terrified. I try to create as 
relaxed an atmosphere as possible," she stated. 

She stressed it is very important to really know your 
subject and be prepared when speaking to an audience. This, 
hopefully, will alleviate much of the anxiety that ac- 
companies public speaking. 

To help make the learning process easier for her students, 
Karns conveys the practicality of learning to communicate. 
"The ability to communicate is what employers are looking 
for today, "she stated. 

In her duties with the Forensics League, the emphasis is 
on team unity, not competition, "i rank success by how 
much an individual has grown while on the team. The 
trophies are just an added bonus." 

Karns stated the team will be hosting a meet scheduled for 
Oct. 18-19. 

Schools from the midwestern region will descend onto our 
campus in an effort to claim as many trophies as possible. 
Anyone interested in joining the forensics league or needing 
more information may stop by room M230.

Men &amp; women netters to improve next season 




By JENNY BLAKLEY 
Sporls Editor 

"We are having difficulties 
(his season," comments 
tennis coach Dan Brogan. 
Difficulty is a key term in the 
men's and women's tennis 
teams' seasons. The men's 
team finished with a winless 
record, and the women's 
team as yet is without a 
victory 

Brogan notes, in reference 



to the women's team, "Of the 
six people from last year, 
only one is back." The 
returning player is senior 
Maria Christen. Brogan 
states, "She'll do pretty well 
in conference, which is in 
two weeks." 

As for the men's team, 
their main season doesn't 
begin until spring, opening 
the last week in March. 
"There should be a big 



improvement in the spring." 
Brogan comments. "Our 
number one player was 
intelligible to play this fall. 
He should be returning in the 
spring, though, (possibly) 
along with a couple of other 
(new) players. If they're all 
able to play, we should have 
a pretty solid team." 

The women will have their 
last home contest today 
against Valparaiso.

In Brief 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 
Sports Editor 

"It was our best team 
performance of the year," 
cross country coach Barrie 
Peterson says of the 
Mastodons' achievement 
last Friday at Manchester. 
The men's team finished 
seventh out of eleven teams, 
with four harriers running 



Spikers split 

ByJENNYBLAKLEY 
Sporls Editor 

The women's volleyball 
learn traveled to Kentucky 
this past weekend to par- 
ticipate in the Northern 
Kentucky Invitational 
Tournament. The Masta dons 
won two and lost two during 
the Friday and Saturday 
games. In their first match, 
they lost to Northern Ken- 
tucky, 11-15, 15-13,9-15 and6- 
15, then lost to Grand Valley, 
7-15, 9-15, 14-16. In their third 
match, they defeated 
Bellarmine, 9-15, 15-5, 15-9 
and 15-3, and beat Asheland 
in their final match, 16-14, 15- 
7, 15-11 The Bella/mine 
defeat gives the Mastodons a 
1-0 conference record. 

Coach Arnie Ball com- 



nts, "We are a very young 
m. We have just one 
• and two juniors, and 
the rest are sophomores and 
freshmen. We have five 
injured girls on the team, 
which also has slowed us 
down. We see improvement 
in every match, though. As 
long as we continue to see 
improvement, we'll be 
pleased." 

Golfers to end 

During the past seven 
years, IPFW soccer teams 
have completed winning 
seasons. This year, the 
Mastadons are 3-5, with 
seven regular season games 
still remaining, as well as 
the GLVC later this month. 

The kickers had an im- 
pressive victory Monday in 
thircold and rainy weather, 



defeating Tri-State 5-1. Kurt 
Benjamin scored two goals, 
and Ricardo de la Torre, Tim 
Bender and Bronn Pfeiffer 
each scored one goal in the 
contest. Rocky Planck added 
one assist. 

The Mastadons are 2-1 in 
their past three games, 
including one shutout 
against St. Joseph, Sept. 24. 
Their next match is today at 
Saint Francis, beginning at 
3:15.

Today, smart homeowners are relying on new, gasdryers 
to do their clothes drying. Not only as a matter of con- 
venience, but also as a way to save energy and money.
