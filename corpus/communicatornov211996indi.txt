Burma involvement causes Pepsi boycott 



by Jeremy Ec«nbargcr 
News Editor 

Whai if someone lold you to slop 
eating Taco Bell's lacos. Pizza Hul's 
pizza or even slop drinking 
Mountain Dew? Many students may 
argue Itae rctjuesL Yet. this is not just 
a bypolhetical question People 
across the U.S are being asked to 
tmycotl PepsiCo Inc. 

Six weeks ago, IPFW's siudeni 
senate was made aware of the boy- 
cott being placed againsi PepsiCo. 
After reviewing literature and dis- 
cussing the statistics, some mem- 
bers of the senate arc now a^sking 
students to get infnmicd and take 



action 

"Educate yourself and know 
what's going on in the government," 
said Eric 
Ledbetiei. a 
political sci- 
ence major 
and student 
senate mem- 
ber 

The boy- 
cott was 
issued as a 
result of the 
PepsiCo' s 
continuing 
pre!!ence in Burma. Hvcn though 
many large corporations have pulled 



out of the Southeast Asian country. 
PepsiCo remains a highly visible 
presence.

Lecturer to discuss 
autistic disorders 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

Studenis interested in areas of a 
psychological nature may find a 
lecture cnLightenmg this week. 

On Friday. Nov. 22, a lecnire 
entitled "Case Studies of Autism: 
Symptoms and Diagnosis with an 
Emphasis on Treatment" will be 
held at 3 p.m. in Keidei, Room 
246 Greg Thaller, associate pro- 
fessor of psychology and clinical 
psychologist, will talk about his 
experiences wiih autism and offer a 
medical diagnosis 

"He is a prominent psycholo- 
gist," said Adam Mccray. psychol- 
ogy club president. "He works with 
a lot of children with autistic disor- 
ders." 

Thaller has worked with both 
adults and children who have dis- 
orders involving autism. Thaller 
also donates a considerable amount 
of time to medical clinics in the 
area, including the Arc of Allen 
County, 

Currently, Thaller is teaching a 
class called "Psychological 
Disorden of Childhood." Starting 
in the spring of 1997, he will begin 
to teach full-time as a visiting 



assistant professor on campus. 

The lecture will by sponsored 
by the psychology club and Psi 
Chi. a sorority on campus. 

Autism is a state of mind char- 
acterized by daydreaming, halluci- 
nations and disregard of external 
reality. 

Within bis lecture, Thaller says 
he will discuss the symptoms of 
autism. These symptoms include 
an impairment of communication 
skills, learning skills and the exis- 
tent act of daydreaming. 

Along with the symptoms, 
Thaller plans to spend some time 
discussing the diagnosis of autism. 
Thaller says that doctors have dif- 
ferent views on the subject, 

"There are cenamly controver- 
sies in the field," said Thaller. 

Psychology club members look 
forward lo hearing Thaller's lec- 
ture. 

A similar event was held last 
year, at which Thaller also spoke. 
According to Mccray, about 20 
people were in attendance. Mccray 
is hoping attendance will t&gt;e up this 
year. 

The psychology club will be 
videotaping the event this year 



ruled by the 
State Law 
and Order 
Rcuoration 
r i.&gt; u n c 1 I 
(SLORC). 
According to 
several 
activists, all 
money that 
the SLORC 
receives 
goes straight into the army As a 
result, the council is funding itself 
by selling off Burma's natural 
resources, using slave labor and 
exporting 70 percent of the world's 
herom. 

Several human rights activists 
feel that the presence of foreign 
companies in Burma endorses die 
SLORC's campaign. The people 
who are boycotting believe that the 
corporations are aidmg the cause of 
the many occurrences that are taking 
place in the coimtry The events tak- 
ing place include everything from 
the country's increasing number of 
AIDS victims to the fact that it has 
the third highest rate of deforesta- 
tion. 

"PepsiCo is not being ethical. 
People should really think about it 
before they renew tbeu' contracts 
with them," said Pon Nya, student 
senate member and former resident 
of Burma "When students boycott 
large company investments, they are 
helping to restore democracy in my 
country." 

Many people who are boycotting 
feel that PepsiCo is aiding the 



SLORC's rule and, in the process, 
making a large profit. In the past, 
PepsiCo has spon.sored many of the 
SLORC's key events Furthermore, 
PepsiCo is the only "junk food" 
company in Burma, which many 
feel is letting the SLORC use 
Pepsi's image to imply U.S. support 
for their ruling methods 

The Pepsi Corporation has bot- 
tled Pepsi and 7-Up in Burma since 
1991. It now plans to set up Pizza 
Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken 
restaurants in the country. 

"The market is there, that's one 
thing we're sure of," said Barry 
Shea. Pepsi vice-president for 
Southeast Asia, when questioned 
about the issue of human ngbts in 
Burma 

Many large corporations in 
Burma have been boycotted in the 
past for the same reason. They 
eventually withdrew all business 
from the country. These finns 
mclude Eddie Bauer, Liz Claiborne. 
Amoco, Petro-Canada, Levi and 
Reebok. 

"It is not possible lo do business 
in (Burma) without directly support- 
ing the military government and its 
pervasive violations of human 
rights," said a spokesperson for Levi 
Strauss m 1992, 

Students can boycoa the corpo- 
ration by simply not buying Pepsi 
products Pepsi products include 
Pepsi. 7-Up, Mountain Dew. Crush. 
Hires, Liptcm Ice Tea. Frito-Lay. 
Ruffles, SunChips. Doritos. 
Cheetos, RoldGold. Smartfood, 
PiZia Hut, KFC and Taco Bell. 

"We're not asking that Pepsi 
products be pulled from campus." 
said Ledbetter "We're just asking 
students to think about it (boycott)." 



According to Ledbetter. the stu- 
dent senate plans to contact both 
Indiana senators to ask for their 
involvement in the boycott. 
Ledbetter is also trying to get cam- 
pus profes'^rs to brmg the issue up 
in theij- class lectures. 



"I believe this is an importani 
issue," said Linda Fox, assistant 
professor of modem foreign lan- 
guage. "I don't beUeve we know 
enough about the nabonal corpora- 
tions and ihetr effect on undevel- 
oped counuies "

Many students are easily influ- 
enced by the words "free" and 
"cheap." With the high cost of a col- 
lege education, students on campus 
are often faced with the growing 
need for health and mental care that 
is cost efficient 

On campus, students have the 
opportunity to take advantage of 
cost-free and economical services. 
The services are offered in a variety 
of fields. 

The areas include medical oppor- 
tunities such as dental care, AIDS 
testing and individual counseling 
Assistance is also available in child 
care. 

In the IPFW Dental Hygiene 
Cbnic. located m Neff Hall, Room 
150, siudenLs receive many of the 
same dental procedures as would be 
found in Fon Wayne area dental 
offices. 

Within the clinic, students are 
able to get their teeth professionally 
cleaned at the price of S16, com- 
pared to the S50 they may spend 
efsewhere. Children of students can 
also get itieir teeth cleaned for S8. 

X-ray pnces vary in accordance 
to complexity Costs range from S16 
for a full mouth X-ray. 58 for a 
panorex X-ray or S8 for a bite wing 
X-ray. 

Studenis can make extra money 
by participating in clinical studies. 
The dental clinic does various exper- 
iments deciphering what products 



are actually more beneficial 

"Studies arc going on all the 
time. Look for flyers around cam- 
pus," said Carl Kleber. associate 
director and research saentist of the 
Health Science Research Center 
"Certain individuals qualify for cer- 
tain studies " 

Kleber said there are stipula- 
tions; absolutely no major health or 
dental problems will be considered 
for study, 

Anodier area is AIDS. Earlier 
this month, free and confidential 
HIV testing was offered on campus 
by the Fort Wayne Allen County 
tiepaitment of Health Testing was 
available to students and the general 
public. 

The department of health will 
return in the spring during "Health 
Fair Week" and in the fall during 
"Safety Week." If requested, they 
will come to IPFW between those 
times and administer the tests 

For the test, blood is drawn from 
the arm. The test identifies whether a 
person has been infected with an 
HIV virus or syphilis Results are 
available two weeks atu:r the initial 
visiL A personal appearance is nec- 
essary to get the results. They will 
not be given over the phone. 

Students looking for help with 
problems that are psychological, 
rather that physical, have access to 
counseling which is also available 
free of charge The service is provid- 
ed at the Joanne B, Lantz Counselor 
Education Clinic by graduate sm- 
dent counselors in training from the 



Indiana University School of 

Education. 

During the counseling sessions, 
students are able to speak with other 
trained students about the problems 
that occur in their lives. 

Sessions are scheduled by 
ai^intment only and take place in 
the evening hours between 5:30 and 
8 p.m in Neff Hall. Room 243. AU 
inquiries are confidential. 

Counseling is extended to all stu- 
dents, regardless of status. Students 
who wish to arrange an appointment 
may call the School of Education at 
481-5405. 

An additional place where coun- 
seling is offered Ls Career Services 
located in Walb Memorial Union, 
Room lUA. Once there, studenis 
may meet with Don Smith, a peer 
counselor, to discuss their mdividual 
causes of anxiety 

Treatment is available to all stu- 
dents who call and schedule an 
appointment Students are entitled to 
seven free sessions each semester. 

As a non-medical service, the 
IPFW Child Care Center is now 
looking for new enrolhnents. All 
students with chddren are welcome. 
Children are accepted from the ages 
of 2 to 12 years old. 

"The service provides more than 
adequate supervision," said S harm on 
Browning, a supervisor at the center 

Registrauon fees are SIO per 
child each semester The hourly rates 
are S2.60 for the fir^t child and 
SI. 60 for each additional cbild. 
Students are limited to 20 hours per

Boycott PepsiCo; 
take a stand 



As students, many of us 
should know that most 
third world countries are 
go vented by oppressive, authoritar- 
ian leg Lines 

These regimes are constantly 
pressured by the ineffecUvc U.N., 
which holds very litUc inriuence 
over these countries' governments 

One case is Burma or Myanmar 
In 1988, ilic Stale Law and Order 
Reslorauon Council (SLORC) 
assumed power and imposed mili- 
laiy rule and slave labor throughout 
Burma. 

PepsiCo entered Burma in 1990 
to set up bottling operations When 
PepsiCo entered into a 
business agreem^it 
in Burma they 
gave ihcir 
approval 
and sup- 
port to 
an ille- 
gal and 
brutal 
regime. 

"Il is 
not pos- 
sible to do 
business in 
[Burma 
without duvctly 
supporting the mili- 
tary government and its 
pervasive violations of human 
rights," a spokesman for Levi 
Strauss said in 1992. The jeans 
company refuses to do business in 
Burma. 

PepsiCo Ignores pleas from the 
people who are forced to become 
human land mine sweeper?; for the 
military PepsiCo ignores cries 
from heroin addicts who are dying 
of AIDS Burma exports over 70 
percent of the worid's heroin. 

bonicaliy. PepsiCo renounced 
South Africa and apartheid in the 
80s. 

SLORC not only expons hero- 
in, but heroin is also "freely avail- 
able on the heavily policed cam- 
puses." (Ontario Public Interest 
Group) 

SLORC represses Burmese 
campuses as a matter of policy. In 
1988. SLORC buichered Lbeir own 
students who were protesting the 
govenuneni outside of the US, 
Embassy Tlie campuses are cor- 



doned off to discourage student 
organization. 

Teachers in Burma aie ordered 
to "guard against inriliraiion of 
undesirable elements m the student 
body" ( Human Rights Watch/ Asia) 

As humans, we have the duty to 
speak out against oppression and 
boycott PepsiCo and its sub- 
sidiaries 

Wc urge IPSGAlocome togeth- 
er and lead the boycott. We know 
they have the energy and leadership 
for this task. 

We urge the administration to 

eliminate the sale of Pepsi products 

on this campus. IPFW's monopoly 

with PepsiCo is a tacit 

approval of PepsiCo 

and their suppon 

of oppression in 




endorse 
brutality 
by drinking 



Mountain Dew, 

Taco Bell. Pizza 

Hut and Kentucky 

Fried Chicken all are owned 

by PepsiCo so before running for 

the border remember the refugees 

who are killed while fleeing 

SLORC and Burma, 

We have the responsibility to 
oppose human rights violations. We 
have the vehicle to hurt PepsiCo 
where it will cause the most pain: 
their pockets. 

PepsiCo used to care about 
human rights Their record in South 
Africa proves thaL But they seem 
[o have forgotten their stance on 
that. 

We should help PepsiCo 
remember why they did not do 
business during apartheid in South 
Africa. 

Contact Mark Souder We are 
sure he would be interested in 
knowing about the amount of hero- 
in exported from Burma. 

His address in Washington DC. 
is: Representative Mark Souder /

Lehers TO THE Editor 



Editor needs to be more positiue 



To the Editor 

As a former editor-in-chief of The 
Communicator. I will always suppon my succes- 
sor's right to free speech, but 1 do not have to 
condone what they say. 1 must first applaud Mr. 
Tupper's openness with bis sexuality and 
attempts at enlightening the community on issues 
of concern for Ihc gay conmiuniiy. 

He's doing the same thing thai 1 did in 
expressing my concerns that the African 
American community expenences. However, 
there is a strong difference between the both of 
us The difference is that I made sure that 1 could 
not be used as a tool of division by those powers 
that are againsi the issues of diversity and unity 
He has allowed himself lo be compromised on 
this issue I'll expand on this issue later 

First of all, if you are going to critically ana- 
lyze a subject or organization, please make sure 
you have done the appropriate research and cov- 
ered all the bases before you start addressing your 
issue of concern. 

In your latest article where you attack the 
office of Multicultural Services and Christine 
Patterson you state that you "haven't M;en a mis- 
sion statement of the office or the job descriptions 
of its worker, so (you) don't know what their 

Frosh 
focuses 

Letter to the Editor: 

I started going to IPFW this fall. 
Having some idea of what school 
would be like since I went here this 
summer, 1 was eager to start. Now. I 
wdladmii that when I just graduated 
from high school I was a bit imma- 
ture, and unfocused, yet outgoing, I 
have always had this thing about 
meeting people, because somehow it 
seems that if I meet you, we are 
equals and just as important lo Uiis 
university as anyone else. 

Now. the reason that I wanted to 
write this letter was because the 
other day, when I was hanging fliers 
for the Students' Government. 1 saw 
this guy who looked hke he was 
lookmg for someUiing So 1 said. "Is 
there something that I can help you 
find?" He rephcd. "I know what I 
am looking for ,„ I just can't find it," 
For some strange reason, that simple 
statement made me think about bow 
so many of us students know what 
we are looking for. but can't seem to 
find il. When I first heard thai state- 
ment, it didn't really bother me, but 
as I sat and thought about it. the 
more it scared me to know how 
many of us students are unfocused, 

I was thinking that since so many 
of us at IPFW are freshman and oth- 
ers arc new here, was there some- 
thing that we could do. or some- 
where we could go to overcome this 
problem, and become more focused 
on what we want and how to get it? 
Thank you 

AtmiAN Russell 



goals and missions are. But (you) think this office 
would be proactive instead of reactive," 

Now if you haven't taken the time to get this 
infomiation. how can you make a valid criticism 
of MCS's purpo.se? Now, who is being reactive 
msicad of proactive. 

Secondly, your attack on MCS should not be 
focused toward the director of the organization 
but the university Here's a hlUe history lesson 
The office of Multicultural Services was first 
called Multicultural Affairs with only one person 
in charge of the position, Beltye Poignard, the 
former director, turned the office into what it Is 
today, a suppon service mainly for students of 
color 

However, the workspace also houses a sup- 
pon service for students with disabilities, MCS 
was not designed to address the issues of homo- 
sexual students but that of students of color 
because of discnmination thai exists for them 
Tliis IS not to discount or not legitimize the dis- 
crimmation that homosexual students experience 
Sexual orientation is an abstract trait that cannot 
be seen whereas skin color is a physical trail 

As far as your personal attack on Christine 
Paiierson, 1 think you need to gel to know her 
before you attack her and not use the paper as a 
vehicle to get back at people. She just took the 



post and has enough to do with getung familiar 
with the communities of color in Fort Wayne, let 
alone the gay community. If you would talk to 
her, you would realize that she is an ally not an 
enemy. 

Personal attacks are destructive and negabvc 
not positive This does not build bridges between 
the gay community and people of color but 
instead builds walls of hostility, indifference and 
division which ls exactly what the powers that be 
want. Tile issue Lsn'l what is MCS doing for gays 
and lesbians but what is IPFW doing for gays and 
lesbians (and a student organization does not cut 
iO. 

By attacking Christine Panerson and MCS. 
the focus has been diverted from the university 
and onto individuals and a department on campus 
that does noi have the ability to make the real 
decisions on campus, which is where our stu- 
denu' monies being allocated 

The personal attack you made is what made 
you a vehicle for the powers that be 

So, please think before you talk and write. I'm 
sure you'll make more albes than enemies and 
move from bemg reactive to proactive. 
Yours in the hope of peace and unity.

Dad. treat me like an adult' 



Guest Column 



Dear Dad. • 

1 wish you could understand that 
I am nol a child anymore, 1 am an 
adull. I know how difficult it is lo let 
go. bul you have to because you are 
killing me inside. You have done 
everything that you can to guide me. 
now it is lime for you to let go, I 
have to go out and make my own 
mistakes and leam from them It is 
lime for me lo become a man. 

These are ihc things 1 have 
dreamed of lelling my dad. Ever 
since 1 was a little child my dad has 
run my life. He still does in a num- 
ber of ways, he tells me what I have 
to do, when 1 have lo do it and how 
[ have to do ii. 

But, for 19 years now, he has 
never told me why I have to do it 
which is fine, in some circum- 
stances, bul he lakes it above and 
beyond. I do not mind helping out 
just nol when I already have plans. 
There have been so many limes 
when 1 have had plans for the week- 
end, and my dad will force me to go 
somewhere and help him. It just 
infuriates me when be does diis, 

I think our whole problem started 
back when I was a kid, 1 should have 
said somcdiing back ihen, because 
now it is way too hard lo say any- 
diing to him ai all My dad thinks 
everything is so perfect He has no 
idea how I really feel about him, 

A good example of this is that my 
dad loves to spend his whole week- 
end up north deer hunting, and so 
obviously be diinks dial I should 
love it as well. Of course, I would 
raihcr stay home and go out with my 
friends Instead of just coming out 
and lellmg him this. I go bunting 
with him I would tell him, but I am 
too afraid dial he will act negatively. 
It cannot be a good sign when your 
own kid is afraid lo say how he real- 
ly feels 

Not only docs he not treat me 
like an adult, bul he compares me to 
my older brodicr. The sad ihing is 
thai be docs not even reaUze that he 
is doing anydiing wrong 1 remem- 
ber as soon as I mmed 18 1 was 
going to get my ear pierced. When 1 
told him my plans, the fir^t thing be 
told me was "Why would you want 



lo do thai? Your 
brother would 
never want to do 
thai," 

Of course 1 gave in and did not 
go 10 gel it pierced. So 1 thought I 
would grow my hair out, but he was 
not fond of this idea either. He told 
me to get my hair cut like my broth- 
er's. Why does he do ihis to me' 
Why will he not let me make my 
own decisions? 

Do not gel me wrong, my broth- 
er is greai and it is nol his fault that 
my dad compares me to him. My 
brother docs not ever say anydiing 
about die decisions 1 Iry to make. He 
somewhat knows what I am going 
through. When we were younger, 
my dad would make us bodi do 
things thai we really did nol want lo 
do. For example, during our summer 
break, while all of our friends were 
outside playing, we would be in the 
bouse cleaning. We had to clean dial 
house every day. 

My dad also made us get a sum- 
mer job, I was about nine and my 
brother was about 12, The job we 
got was nol bard by any stretch of 
the imagination. We had lo get all of 
die local baseball fields ready for the 
games that would be played on them 
dial night. 

Like I said before, u was nol 
hard, unless ii rained. If it rained, we 
bad 10 go die fields and squeegee off 
all of Ihe water on the infield. It is 
not the fact that we spent our sum- 
mers working, ii is the fact that my 
dad made us spend our summers 
working. 

My brother Ls now 22 and attend- 
ing lUPUI. My dad no longer treat', 
him the way he treats me 1 ihink ihe 
biggest reason for this is because by 
hrodicr no longer lives ai home. He 
knows that if he tells him to do 
somelhing that he does 
do. he will not come home and visit 
liim. 



Because I attend IPFW 1 still live 
at home I do not have a choice but 
to do whatever it is that Dad wants 
me to do. This somewhat explains 
why I still gel treated unfairly and 
my brother does not. 

I also have a younger brother and 
a younger sister, I can easdy explain 
why my sister docs not gel treated 
like I do. She is only 5 years old, but 
mosdy because she is a girl. 

My younger brother, on the other 
hand is Ihirieen, I have no idea why 
my dad does nol treat him the way 
he treated my when 1 was his age. 
My only guess would be because 1 
am still around lo do all of the work. 
I have a feeling that as soon as I get 
out of ihe bouse he will get all of the 
work dumped onto his shoulders 

My friends tell me to stick up for 
myself and for what I want to do. bul 
they do not understand that I cannot 
I have tried before, but if I would 
ever take it too far it would be a liv- 
ing bell. He is very unpredictable 
Like 1 said before my dad diinks that 
everydiing is perfect There is a fine 
line between respect and fear- 
respect is earned. Unfortunately, my 
dad has nol earned my respeci, he 
has brought me to fear him I have a 
feeling dial my dad has a rude awak- 
ening coming his way, sometime. As 
soon as I get out of Uiat house 1 am 
going to tell him how I feel. 

Since I cannot tell my dad how 1 
feel 1 have to lell my mom She 
hears ii all. For a long time I jusi 
kept it bottled up inside, and thai 
was definitely not the answer. One 
day dad was really on me about me 
saying Ihal 1 did nol enjoy hunting 
and did not want to go with him I 
could not hold my feelings in any- 
more so 1 went lo my mom. who has 
always understood me. I told her 
what was going on between me and 
my dad. Like always, she was very 
understanding and gave me some 
advice. 



She told me that soon it will be 
all over, because I wdl be moving 
out in a couple of years, and that I 
should try lo be happy WeL, this 
worked for but it is back lo the same 
old thing. I should not have to lie 
and be unhappy just to make my dad 
happy. 

1 am an adult and I just wish dad 
could see and understand that, I have 
a pan time job; 1 am a full time stu- 
dent: I drive a car and most of all 1 
am old enough to go mto Ihe armed 
forces and vote. All of i^y friends 
andallofmy family (except my dad) 
treat me like an adult 

1 know I am only 19 years old 
and I do not have very much experi- 
ence, but nevertheless. I am an adult. 
1 have ah-eady made some decisions 
m the short ume that I have been 
around dial some people have never 
had to make. Such as. having to tell 
a friend "No" lo drugs and having 
bad lo make Ihe decision of the des- 
ignated driver I have even had to 
explain to a friend's mother why her 
son came home drunk. For diese rea- 
sons. I feel that I am a responsible 
adult, 

I guess what I am trying to gel 
across is this: "Dad. if you are read- 
mg Ihis, treat me hke the adult dial I 
am, 1 am proving lime and again that 
I am a responsible person. 
Everybody else treats me the way I 
deserve to be treated. Please treat me 
like an adult "

(SeacSonal affective dkorder 

An explanation of winter depression 



and 




by Mary Ann Boolunyer, RN 

sufr wriur 

Tbc autumn leaves bave fallen 
and winter is juM around Ibe comer. 
For many people, this is tbe time of 
the year when they anticipate the 
first snowfall, prepare for the holi- 
days and look forward to winter 
sports. However, for up lo 25 percent 
of ihe populauon. ihe stioner days 
are ac£ompanic«l by feelings of 
depression and a lack of energy. 
Since 1987, the American 
Psychiatric Associalion has formally 
recognized the inHuence of seasonal 
changes on mood dttordcrs. 

What is seasonal 
affective disorder? 

Seasonal aflcciive disorder 
(SAD), is a condition in wbicb 
symptoms of depression appear dur- 
ing \be late fall monibs and craitin- 
ue throughout the winicr 
When spring arrives, the 
associated symptoms cease 
TTiere is a less common con- 
dition called "reverst 
SAD" m which the 
depressive symptoms 
occur during the spring 
and summer months 
and resolve in the 
fall. Less mfonnauon 
is known about this 
condition and its 
causes. 

Although SAD is a 
form of depression, it 
is unique because its 
symptoms are not entirely consistent 
with those associated with "typical'" 
depression As with dejvcssion, suf- 
ferers of SAD may experience a 
depressed mood, anxiety, irritability, 
decreased ability to concenliate. 
decreased activity level, diminished 
libido and alterations in interperson- 
al relationships. 

Unhke typical depression. SAD 
is characterized by increased sleep, 
increased appetite, cravings for 
sweets and carbohydrates and weight 
gain. The occunence of SAD fol- 
lows a seasonal pattern because both 
Ihe onset and the end of the symp- 
toms take place during specific sea- 
sons of the year Other types of 
depression do not occur widi thi,s 
type of predictable pattern 

Identifying SAD 

The American Psychiatric 
Associaticm has established criteria 
for identifying a seasonal influence 
on mood disorders. In addition to 
the seasonal pallcras fw the onset 



HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp; A 



Q. Some of my friends 
worry about getting HIV 
in restaurants from 
silverware, glasses, 
cups, etc. Is that 
possible? 

A. No. HIV infection is not 
spread like colds or flu. To 
infect someone, the virus 
has to get into the 
bloodstream, an unlikely 
event in a restaurant, The 
virus can't survive long 
outside the body, and even 
if it could, dishwashing 
would kill It.

remission 
of symptoms, 
the symptoms 
must have fol- 
lowed the same seasonal pattern for 
at least the past two years. Finally. 
the incidence of seasonal episodes of 
depression must outnumber any 
depressive episodes which occurred 
at other limes of the year during 
one's life. Because there is no specif- 
ic medical test to diagnose the condi- 
tion, personal information about Ihe 
presence of symptoms and the histo- 
ry of symptom occurrence is vital to 
diagnosing SAD. 

Who is likely to 

HAVE SAD? 

It is estimated that 6 percent of all 
SAD sufferers are so severely affect- 
ed by the condition that iheir work 
and social relationships are negative- 
ly affected. Women are four times 
more likely to develop SAD dian are 
men Although the disorder usually 
begins when individuals are in their 
20's or 30's, many sufferers 
report their symptoms 
began when they were 
children or teenagers. 
Although there are 
general symptoms. 
children and ado- 
lescents may be 
affected dif- 
ferently than 
adults In 
children and 
adolescents, 
the condition 
may be exhib- 
ited by behavioral changes 
and school-related prob- 
lems, SAD symptoms in 
adulLs are mostly associated with 
feelmgs of sadness or irritation: poor 
concentration, excessive worrying 
and tiredness. 

The precise cause of SAD is 
unknown However, one-third of the 
pec^le with SAD have a close rela- 
tive who also has the condition 

Causes of SAD 

There are several theories about 
the causes of SAD One theory sug- 
gests circadian rbydim changes con- 
tribute to the condition Circadian 
rhythms are similar to an iniemal 





clock 
found in 
the brain. 

These rhythms regulate a person's 
bodily functions such as sleep pat- 
terns, temperature and hormme lev- 
els over a 24-hour time period 
Cijcadian rhythms are affected by 
the amount of light and darkness in 
the environment Since there is less 
hgbl during the wmier months, the 
body's natural rhythms arc changed, 
which causes alterations m mood 
This is similar to what happens to 
people who consistcndy work the 
night shift. 

Another theory focuses specifi- 
cally on the role of the pineal gland 
Tbis small gland, which is located 
deep inside the brain, manufacmres a 
hormone called melatonin 
Melatonin has been found lo cause 
drowsiness Since the gland is regu- 
lated by circadian rhythms, it is 
affected by the amount of environ- 
mental light and darkness Normally, 
melatonin is released into ihe blood- 
stream during the night and may 
function to help produce sleep 
During the day, when there is enough 
Ught in the environment, the secre- 
tion of melatonin stops However, 
during the winter months more of the 
hormone is relea.sed. It is theorized 
diat diis excessive amount of mela- 
tonin causes symptoms of depres- 
sion. 

Treatment for SAD 

Fortunately, there is effective 

treatment for SAD The symptoms of 
the disorder can be reheved through 
the use of ariificial lights. The lights 
are contained inside a specially 
designed box. The intensity of the 
artificial light is equivalent to the 
amount of sunlight on a sunny day 
m spring. This strength is 5 times 
greater ihan Lhe amount of indoor 
hghi commonly used in a home. 
Once this Ught reaches the eyes, a 
signal is sent to the brain. The signal 
causes readjustment of the circadian 
rhythm and the cessation of mela- 
tonin seaeuon by the pineal gland. 
The symptoms of SAD are usu- 
ally improved within 3 to 5 days. 
However, H may take up to 2 weeks 
before there is marked improve- 
ment Light therapy must be used on 
a regular basis dunng the winter 



because 
symptoms may 
return within 3 
days after treat- 
ment. Although this type of treat- 
ment IS effective, il may be accom- 
panied by side effects. 

Antidepressant medications are 
another effective treatment used for 
SAD. Although there arc a wide vari- 
ety of antidepressants, these medica- 
tions all work by restoring the bal- 
ance of various chemicals m the 
brain which are altered in the pres- 
ence of depression. Antidepressants 
are prescribed under the supervision 
of a physiciaa and the effects of 
these medications may not be evi- 
dent for at least two weeks after 
starting treatmenL Antidepressants 
may be used alone or combined with 
light therapy. 

Possible side effects 

The most frequently reponed side 
effecLs are headaches, eyestrain, irri- 
tabiUty, nausea and vomiting. These 
effects can be relieved by altering die 
intensity of the light, the duration of 
the therapy, or the proximity of the 
light box during treatment. No pre- 
scription is needed to purchase a 
light box They are available to the 
pubUc and can be obtained at an 
average cost of S400 to S500. 

As with any other suspected con- 
dition. It IS important not lo attempt 
to diagnose oneself. Aside from sea- 
sonal changes, there are many other 
physical, emotional and soaal fac- 
tors which can coninbute to feelings 
of depression. A family physician 
and/or a qualified mental health pro- 
fessional should be consulted lo 
a.ssist individuals who arc concerned 
that they may suffer from SAD

ery annoying 
Qadafhy and other leaders of the 
Middle Easi use ihe grcaicsi name 
of God to justify their power. Allah 
(God) commands all humans to Uve

humble. There is no such power as 
that of Allah Humans are just one 
of Allah's creations fulfiUing the 
universe. Humans are created from 
limited matcnals. Therefore, there 
is nothing eternal about human

death. But these rules cannoi be 
applied to Ihe Greamess of God 

Understanding the presence of 
God requires a strong conmiiuneni

Neither am I capable in proclaiming 
my religiosity I believe that no one 
can measure the degree of her reli-

and humans, which does noi need 
human involvement.

While traditional newspapers and 
magazines are held to a certain 
amount of inches, the Iniemei offers 
unlimited space. Readers are given 
the option to review simple news 
briefs or to \ooV. at large, in-deplb 
stories The choice is iheirs. 

With the huge i.-ompeii[ion ring 
in ihe newspaper industry. Fort 
Wayne area newspapers are already 
looking inio new formats 

"We re already positionuig our- 
selves to be ready for whatever 
direction it (newspaper industry) 
will lake People may soon prefer 
newspapers m this (Iniemet's) for- 
mat,'' said Jody Habayeb. on-hne 
manager for The Journal Gazelle "If 
we aren't out there offering news on 
the Iniemei. someone else will: 
we're selimg our grounds now." 

Habayeb emphasises that there 
are posiUvc and negative aspects of 
newspapers m cyberspace She fecLs 
thai readers will enjoy Ihe variety of 
information that is aiiainable on the 
Iniemei- Yet, deadlmes seemed to be 
her favonie pan. 

"Dcadlines arc 
no longer a prob- 
lem," said 
Habayeb. "We can 
quickly update 
things, ' 

Neverlheleiv 
there are down 
sides to offering 
news over the 
screen. One thing 
b the fact ihai people like the mobil- 
ity of formal newspapers. There are 
many people who do not relish the 
idea of uyuig to carry lap top com- 
puters in order lo read the ttews. 

Olher people who cnddzc such 
newspapers wotiy that ihcy are cut- 
ting out many job opportunities that 
are now available in the printing 
industry 

So, instead of waiting for the 




paper boy lo deliver the newspapers, 
news is seni lo homes from web sites 
across the counlry With the new 
process. Iniemei users are becoming 
linked lo writers, and odier readers 
for that matter, to discuss issues that 
are being mentioned This technique 
allows the audience to not only 
receive the facts of a story, but it also 
invites alternative opinions on the 
subject matter 

Ad VE urns INC.. 

The Iniemei also offers new 
avenues for advertisers 

Advertisements m the Iniemei are 
extremely "user friendly." When 
searching the WWW, people are 
given the chance to receive coupons, 
partiapatc on mleractive commeni 
lines (which allow the audience to 
leave suggestions) and read more 
background infomiation on a partic- 
ular company. 

Advertisements range in differ- 
ent sizes and colors 

"We're having a really hard lime 
pinpointing where to place ads," 
said Gary Jesse, web engmeer for 
The News-Sentinel. 

According to Jesse, different ads 
arc used for different 
purTXJses One set of 
ads, called banner 
ads. arc used lo just 
attract the audi- 
ence's attention. By 
displaying the mov- 
mg 3d across the top 
of a web page. 
advertisers eniice 
readers to look fur- 
ther 

Another ad is the clique ad. The 
advenisemeni is meant for con- 
sumers who wish lo learn more 
about the product they are buying 
Jesse says that large car dealerships 
are using this avenue to introduce 
people to the latest treixls in Iheir 
tine of automobiles 

These alternative means of 
attaining consumers are involving 
both the seller and buyer. 



Students to perforin 
French play 



by Cassie RItter 
Featiuvs Editor 




in a "French Lileramrc" course pre- 
sent the play Jeu d' Adam. 

The otie-aCT play is a modern- 
ized version of the story of Adam 
and Eve in the Garden of Eden and 
is directed by Nancy E. Virtue, 
assistant professor of French 

"We've sei the whole play in a 
university so Adam and Eve are 
students and (jod is a professor," 
Vinuc said. 

It jusl so worked out that there 
is only one male student out of the 
su m Virtue's "French Literature" 
course, which is why Adam and the 
devil are played by women. 



According to Virtue, ihe play 
will be understandable lo most 
French students as well as benefi- 
cial. "It's a siory most everyone 
knows and we use a lot of gestures 
that would help firil year stu- 
dents," Virtue said. 

This is not your ordinary play 
about Adam and Eve, on the con- 
trary, it could prove to be some- 
what controversial to some, bow- 
ever Virtue hopes that it is under- 
suxxl as it is intended to be — 
somewhat humorous. Virtue 
declares thai she diiecied the play 
so that God is turned into a rather 
farcical character who is overly 
authoritative and sort of ridiculous 
and gels ordered around a lot by a 
certain character on stage. 

"We did this because everyone 
knows die Adam and Eve st(»y, but 
10 go and just see a very straight 
representation of Adam and Eve 
getting thrown out of paradise, 
probably would not be wildly 
entertaining for anyone," Virtue 
said. "We warned to lake a cynical, 
20th century perspective on it." 

The play wUI be Dec. 5, at 7:30 
p.m. in the Suidio Theatre, Kciller 
Hall, Room G32. Everyone is wel- 
cone to the free event. 



Advertisements normally seen in 
our everyday experiences simply 
inform. The Iniemei is allowing par- 
ticipants to learn more and advise 
changes in the product. 

A^■OTIIER fJiTlIBTAINlNG MEDIA... 

Along with news and informa- 
tion, the Iniemei also attempts lo 
bnng entenainmeni lo iLs users. 

Last year, the WWW introduced 
a new web site meant to add some 
heated drama to peoples' lives. As if 
people did not have enough chaos in 
their hves, a new soap opera called 
"East Village" attempts to add some 
more. 

"I don't think it (East Village) 
will take over TV dramas," said 
Kathcrinc Kcaung, vice-president of 
Marketing and Commumcations for 
East VUlage. "TV is TV, a book is a 
book the web is jusl a different 
enpenence " 

While many people often gadier 
to watch their favorite characters 
deal with the problems in their lives. 
the Iniemei lacks this aspect. 
However, a clique system is avail- 
able for users allowing them to carry 
a conversauon with their favorite 
characters and odier fans. Keating 



says participants form a son of com- 
munity in their clique 

Anodicr difference involves the 
fact that "East Village" builds more 
on its siory lines. Issues such as drug 
abuse and gay relationships can be 
covered honestly on the web sue. 

The third alteration that "Ea.st 
Village" has introduced is the simple 
tmdi Ihai people using computers 
just need somethuig to do. 

"When people are in die ofTicc, 
they often mn out of diings lo do." 
said Keating. "They don't have a 
television there, so they can just go 
to our website" 

Ail these mediupis have been 
altered when ihey became replicated 
over the Iniemei. Many people feel 
ii may change the job market, Ihe 
mass media and iniemational rela- 
tions forever Yei. is it a positive 
change? 

As Ihc Intemel conlmues lo grow 
in populanly, people inaeasingly 
communicate with odicrs over a 
computer screen. While writing 
skills may improve, what will hap- 
pen to the tradilional skills and val- 
ues that now run our lives?

Volleydons win conference, gain tourney berth 




Pholo by Andtew Johnslon, Journal GazeOe 
Dottje Porch blocks a Soulhem Indiana spike last Thursday at the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference volleyball tournament 



b&gt; S. Brant K&lt;lley 
Sporls Editor 

\jas\ week, the Volleydons defeat- 
ed conference challenger Nortbem 
Kentucky in three straight games 
Then they killed the University of 
Soulhem Indiana - which had carried 
them to a be art- stopping five games 
earlier - in the first round of the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference louma- 
meni, and IPFW was destined for a 
fun weekend. 

IPFW won two more matches. 
losing only one game the entire 
weekend, en route to its fourth GLVC 
loumamenl title in six years and its 
first NCAA Division M loumameni 
berth m eight years. 

With treatmcni which would be 
labeled cruel and unusual outride of 
the volleyball court, the Volleydons 
summarily dismantled the Screaming 
Eagles, allowing them only five 
points during the entire match 

"We probably came out more 
exau^d than any other match this 
year," IPFW coach Tun Heffron said, 
"We just had everything going for us. 
The volleyball gods were with us. 

"Everything we cried worked." 

Everything worked, starting with 
Dotije Porch, who single-handedly 
grounded the Eagles with 15 kills in 
only 20 attempts. 

"It was the match with the fewest 
mistakes all year," Heffron said, 

"It was a situation where we truly 
feared their capability be&lt;:ause they 
had earned us out to five games and 



ihey had beaten Northern Kentucky." 

The 'IX&gt;ns squeaked by on a nail- 
biici at the Eagles on Sept. 14 IPFW 
escaped with a five-game win only 
by scoring 11 of the final 13 points 
Ctafending GLVC champ NKU was 
the leading challenger for the title. 
wmning 14 regular- season confer- 
ence matches to IPFW's 15 

IPFW's second match of the 
weekend featured the University of 
Missouri-Sl Louis, much to 
Heffron's surprise UMSL downed 
an up-and-coming Lewis stjuad 
which featured a former Division I 
player only recently declared eligible 
to play 

"I was really surprised," Heffron 
said of Lewis "[UMSL] just kind of 
gave Lewis enough rope and let them 
go at iL" 

UMSL and IPFW fought a gritty. 
unremarkable match which closely 
resembled the previous match 
between the two teams at the Gates 
Center, also won by IPFW 

"It was kmd of a nondescript 
match," Heffron said, "We did not 
play well, ll became a blue collar 
match for us " 

The Volleydons nonetheless grap- 
pled to a 15-9. 15-5, 15-8 victory 
over the Riverwomen to advance to 
the conference finals for die tenth 
straight year 

NKU defeated a young, but tal- 
ented Southern Illinois Universily- 
Edwardsville team in the other seou- 
final, 15-13, 16-14, 15-7. in a match 
which was closer than the score. 



"To that point, Northern 
Kentucky did not play well at all." 
Heffron said. "They could easily 
have lost both (matches]." 

The match against the Nurse was 
a rematch of IPFW's lopsided victory 
a week earhcr in which IPFW won 
15-12, 15-11. 15-4. at the Gates 
Center, and of last year's final which 
the Norse won in four games. 

The results in the final were clos- 
er but similar to a week earlier: 15- 
12. 16-14, 15-12, 15-13 

"We came out more like the LISI 
match, look a big lead," Heffron said, 
"then they stepped it up a notch." 

After watching an 11-3 lead evap- 
orate like morning mist, the 
Volleydons regrouped and held on [o 
win game one, 15-12 

L'sing the momentum gained m 
the second half of game one. the 
Norse took control in game two, eras- 
ing ideas of a repeat three-set victory 
by grabbing an 8-1 lead before fin- 
ishing the game, 16-14 

"They were on fire," Heffron 
said. 'They were playing well." 

Despite the loss, the Volleydons 
gained momenmm from game two 
and fiom the Uiird game, IPFW took 
over, winning games three and four, 



15-12. 15-13. 

The momentum shift again 
favored Porch, who singed the Norse 
with 24 kills, a personal best for the 
season 

Porch earned all-GLVC honors 
along with Andi Rei chart. 

"We built a lead the next game." 
Heffron said. "They dropped down 
and they could not make another 
mental push. 

"Menially, we owned the [match] , 
Even at the point where we were 
down 12-4 (in the second game), we 
mentally owned Ihe match " 

The win has propelled IPFW to 
the Greai Lakes Regional tournament 
as the fourth seed The 'Dons face 
top-seeded Northern Michigan 
University at Marquette. Mich, on 
Friday night 

Second-ranked NMU finished 
atop the Great Lakes Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference, the premier vol- 
leyball conference in the region. 

To beat NMU. the Volleydons 
will have to be on top of their game, 
Heffron said. 

"We match up well with than," 
Heffron said. "They're an offense- 
oriented team. "We're going to 
have to put together a good match." 



Local support for IPFW 
Athletics sorely lacking

Men's basketball begins new era 



by S. Brant KeU«y 
SparU t^titor 

Wilb so many new faces on [he 
team, perhaps IPFW men's basket- 
ball coach John Williams woulJ 
view his fust season wilb the 
Mastodons wiih a little trepidation. 

Not at all. 

To the contrary. Williams is 
eagerly anticipating the 1996-97 
basketball campaign and his infec- 
tious conHdcnce has raised the spir- 
its of the entire team. 

"We wcce anticipating a lot this 
year," Junior forward Kyle Kirby 
said. "Wc have a new coach and 
new players. It's been fun to mesh 
the old and the new " 

Coming over from St, Francis 
College across town, Williams has 
brought a slew of transfer talent in 
low, and the player mixture seeim to 
be a healthy one. 

To mix with an eighl-playcr 
returning cast, four fonner St. 
Francis players have followed 
Williams to join what promLses to he 
a fun season based at the Gates 
Center 

"We've really gotten to know 
each other through the summer." 



Williams said. 

"The lough thing was out on the 
floor," he added, "[But) Uiey respect 
each other, each other's lalcnL" 

Mutual respect has carried the 
Mastodons through two lopsided 
exhibition wms in the preseason. 
and Williams hopes, will carry them 
through the season as well. 

"We have 1 3 players who arc eli- 
gible and I'm comfortable playing 
any of them," Williams said. 

Some of those 13 will replace 
graduated senior K,C, Runyan, 
departed junior Ryan Bond and red- 
shin junior Ryan Glidden. Bond, an 
hoiiorablc mention all-confcrencc 
selection last season, decided to 
forego his senior season to pursue to 
career in teaching 

Runyan, who won a couple of 
games his junior season on game- 
ending &amp;ee throws, played bis last 
year, and Glidden recently decided 
to hold off playing basketball this 
year for personal reasons. 

Despite the departed. IPFW will 
field a team loaded with collegiate 
experience, including seniors Jeff 
Jackson and Derek Miller and Five 
juniors, 

"We've got a lot of senior leader- 



ship, a lot of upperclassmen," 
WiUiams said. 

With the experience and the deep 
bench, Wilhams will play a grey- 
hound-style of basketball, using the 
entire court on both offense and 
defense with fast breaks and press- 
ing. 

"Coach WiUiams' philosophy is 
a lot more motion ofTetise." Kirby 
said, "a lot more freedom " 

Williams' floor leader will be St. 
Francis transfer Craedel Key, an all 
Mid-Central Conference player dur- 
ing his two years with the Cougars. 

"He's going to make a lot of 
noise in the conference," Williams 
said. "He's a good floor leader" 

Starting opposite Key will be 
two-year starter and tri-caplain 
Jason Werling. Named the team's 
most valuable player last season. 
WerUng will provide bnng his 43- 
percent three-poini shooting and 75 
percent free-throw shooting to a 
potent guard corps. 

"He's a leader, he works hard," 
Williams said, "he's a student of the 
game, [and] he's a gutsy player." 

To balance the ouLside attack, 
junior Dane Adams is the center of 
WiUiams' plans. After starting most 



of his freshman season, Adams was 
a stMnetimes-starU-r last year who 
came on strong during the season's 
second half, Adams apparently has 
relumed in new form and is ready to 
take charge in the middle this sea- 
son. 

'T)ane has surprised everybody 
in the preseason," WiUiams said 
"He jumps well and has a nice touch 
on his shot." 

Williams also praised Adams' 
defensive performance against 
Russian seven-footer Alexei 
Prokhorenko during the 'Dons' 
exhibition game against the Red 
Army Select team la.si Friday night 
at the Gates Center. 

Kirby returns to one forward 
spot where he recwded the nation's 
best field goal percentage la.st year 
at 68,2 percent. 

Former Cougar Charles Porter 
returns to the other forward spot 
where WiUiams wiU put his athleti- 
cism to good use. An all-MCC and 
all-NAJA District 22 selection last 
year at SFC, Irt-captain Porter 
brings a needed explosiveness to the 
Mastodons' front Ime 

"(Poner) is probably the best 
athlete on the team as far as raw taj-

Corrections: 

Last week's sports article, 
"Women's basketball full of new 
faces." failed to mention two play- 
ers' names. Krista Hennmgs and 
Shalauna McMiUan. 

The piciiues of Nol Beckley and 
Jeremy Ecenbarger were misplaced 
on last week's opinions page 



Beckley's picture should have 
accompanied the article 

"Homosexuality does not justify 
murder," and Ecenbarger's picture 
should have accompanied the aru- 
cle, "Work vs school." 

We apologize for any inconve- 
nience caused by these errors. 



ent is concerned," Williams said. "I 
think the fans are going to be excit- 
ed to see him play " 

Added into the mix are eight 
more players, any of whom could 
see significant playing time on a 
given night Ihe third tri-captain, 
Jeff Jackson, as well as returnees 
J.B Showalier. R.J. Falcone and 
Beau Ryder return from last year to 
add spark off the bench and trans- 
fers Adam Moore and Kevin Bealty 
should season the mix a little. A lone 
freshman. Randy Spicer from 
Richmond, rounds out the lineup. 

Coining off of its third straight 
losing season, IPFW's team no 
longer possesses an active player 
who remembers a winning season, 
According to WiUiams. Uiat may 



have begun to demorabze some of 
the returning players, and now that 
is changing, 

"Once they (the players) feel 
good about themselves, they're 
going to be bctiei," Williams said. 

The team is hoping the new sys- 
tem and added confidence translate 
into a top-half GLVC fmish. their 
second in four years. 

"I think we're not going to peak 
out as early in the year," Werling 
said. "This year, there's a lot we can 
get better at as the season progress- 
es." 

The 'Dons begin their regular 
season tomorrow night at 8 p.m. in 
■he Summit City ShoutouU held at 
the Gates Center IPFW tips off 
against Tn-Staie University.
