On Wednesday, Aug. 30, IPFW re- 
ceived an official invitation to join 
the Mid-Continent Conference. 

The Division 1 conference includes 
universities such as Valparaiso Uni- 
versity, Oral Roberts University, and 
Oakland University. 

IPFW is not expected to formally 
accept the Mid-Con's invitation until 
after Sept. 1 1 , when the Fort Wayne 
Senate meets and votes on campus. 
The Faculty Senate Subcommittee 
on Athletics has already urged its 
approval. 

Upon formal acceptance, IPFW 
will begin its conference participa- 
tion during the 2007-08 school year. 
Each sport will reap benefits 



from joining the Mid-Con. Kent 
Hormann, director of athletic 
marketing and broadcasting said, 
"(Conference affiliation] will boost 
recruiting, whether it's tennis, soc- 
cer, golf or basketball." 

According to Hormann, coaches 
from other institutions have used 
IPFW's independent status to re- 
cruit against IPFW in the past. 

The benefits of joining the con- 
ference are listed in a document 
written by the Faculty Senate Sub- 
committee on Athletics. 

According to the subcommittee's 
document, "(Joining the Mid-Con- 
tinent Conference] would provide 
better schedules, more recognition 
for student athletes, opportunities 
to participate in NCAA tourna- 
ments for all sports, more public- 
ity for the university, and increased 



opportunities. 

Information such as a student- 
athlete's GPA, the university's athletic 
mission statement, gender equality, 
fund availability, and area hotels were 
deciding factors in the Mid-Con's con- 
sideration of IPFW. 

Joining the Mid-Con requires an ini- 
tiation fee as well as annual dues from 
the member schools. Although the 
act cost of joining the conference has 
not yet been determined, Pope 
quick to point out that part of the 
son for joining the Mid-Con is to make 
money. 

Hormann expects conference affili- 
ation to provide greater image recog- 
nition for IPFW, high-caliber student 
athletes, and revenue for the con 
nity. "It should be win-win-win all the 
way around," he said.

maps that correlated to his point. 

Lutz took a role in clarifying 
some misunderstandings and pro- 
jections made by the media. 

"Lebanon is a very diverse coun- 
try. It's not diverse in the miscon- 
ception that the entire country is 
Arab, but it's divided into a variety 
of Christian groups and also groups 
that are hard to classify," Lutz said. 

Carr spoke on the history of the 
region, emphasizing the border

the exchange of hostages. 

According to Carr, the region's 
fighting began when the Hezbol- 
lah Militia Group within southern 
Lebanon fired a rocket across the 
border into Israel. Israel's Defense 
Forces were patrolling between 
the border of Lebanon and Israel 
when the Hezbollah Militia staged 
an ambush, killing a number of sol-

Ongoing conflicts in the Middle 
East have been appearing on daily 
news programs for years. Recentiy, 
a public forum was held in Walb

Four panelists were present: El-

political science; Steve Carr, asso- 

James Lutz, professor and chair 
of the department of political sci-

professor of political science. Vince

Bartky began the forum with a

Student 

Granted 

Award 

By Laura Dumas 



Every year, the American 
Society for Microbiology 
(ASM) acknowledges the ac- 
complishments of who they 
deem to be the best and 
brightest undergraduate stu- 
dents engaging in microbio- 
logical research. 

With only a few select spots 
available annually for the 
ASM Undergraduate Research 
Fellowship, the chances of 
receiving such a prestigious 
honor are relatively rare. Yet, 
IPFW student Denise Nico- 
losi has beaten those odds

a feat that is practically un- 
heard of according to and 
Nicolosi's mentor, biology 
professor Robert J. Visalli. 

"It's very rare. I can say that 
it's probably happened, but 
I'm not aware of it," Visalli 
said. "Denise is a top-notch 

Nicolosi first applied for 
and received the fellowship in 
2004 as a sophomore, when a 
majority of her competitors 
were seniors, some coming 
from large universities such 
as Yale and Columbia. 

She was so pleased with the 
experience that she decided 
to try again last February. 

Feeling more confident 
and experienced two years 
later, Nicolosi, a biology ma- 
jor, submitted the research 
grant she had co-written with 
Visalli, as well as two letters 
of recommendation and an 
official transcript to ASM, the 
world's largest organization 
of microbiologists. 

"Knowing how competi- 
tive the ASM undergraduate 
fellowship is, I did not ex- 
pect that I would receive the 
fellowship twice. When I re- 
ceived the award letter from 
ASM, I was very excited to be 
the recipient of another ASM 
Undergraduate Research Fel- 
lowship," Nicolosi said. 

As part of the first fellow- 
ship, Nicolosi was able to 
present her research at the 
105th ASM general meeting 
in Adanta, a seminar that at-

that I am currently working 
on for the Undergraduate 
Research Fellowship consists 
of identifying the interacting 
regions on each of the pro- 
teins of an interacting pair," 
Nicolosi said. 

Visalli is particularly proud 
that his student's success has 
brought attention to the work 
being done in Fort Wayne. 

"This gives a bunch of ex- 
posure that we're doing re- 
search," Visalli said. "This

tance of course, to pursue a 
master's degree in biology in 
the spring of 2007. After my 
master's degree, I plan to get 
my Ph.D. in molecular virol- 
ogy. Ultimately, I would like 
to do some type of research 
that investigates infectious 
disease," Nicolosi said.

Toole also delved into his- 
tory and the read 
litical "actors," such as the 
United States and the Unit- 
ed Nations, and their roles 
in the Middle East. He also 
spoke of the difference in 
support from allies towards 
Israel and Arabs as a whole 

"There's traditionally been 
a tension in the U.S. in deal- 
ing with the Middle East. On 
the one hand the U.S. has 
been a strong traditional ally 
of Israel. On the other hand 
the U.S. has made good ef- 
forts over the years at being 
perceived as an internation- 
al power that both sides can 
trust," said Toole. 

The rest of the time was 
dedicated to questions and 
answers reflecting the role 
of the media, the United 
States, and its agenda.

sponsored by the American 
Democracy Project and the 
Mike Downs Center for In- 
diana Politics, will be aired 
on Sunday, Sept. 17 at 7 p.m.

Advantages and Disadvantages of 



Pro 



Paying for College 



Advantages to Paying 
for One's Own Education 



By Heather Etzler 



So, you have worked two exhaust- 
ing jobs the whole summer just to 
pay for this year of college. You go 
into class, sit down and the first 
thing you hear someone say is 
"Yeah, my parents pay for every- 

If you are someone who would 
immediately get mad at that 
person's statement, maybe you 
should think again. There are three 
main benefits I can think of if you 
are someone who pays your own 
college bills. 

First, paying for your own school 
makes you work harder in class. 
We have all had to pay for some- 
thing in our lives and have prob- 
ably found that when you pay for 
something, it means more to you. 
If you are paying for college your- 
self, you are getting the grades you 
want because not getting those 
grades means you are wasting your 
money. 

Second, it is something you did 
by yourself. You are more indepen- 
dent; you as well as others recog- 
nize that you worked for it and you 
earned it. You have the satisfaction 
; ofbeingabletosay,"Yes! Ipaidfor ■ 
it all myself." 

Lastly, it is a good example of 
how life is in the real world. Things 
are not normally going to be hand- 
ed to you and you are better able 
to understand that concept more 
than someone who has everything 
handed to them.

Consolidation Justifies 
Parents Paying for 
College 

By Said EL-Dajani 



Consolidation is a word that I 
have only heard in movies. I never 
realized it actually existed. I think 
it's safe to say that I still really do 
not know what it means. If I take 
a poll of students who think they 
know what consolidation signifies, 
1 might not be surprised-to hear- 
that they don't know what it means : 
either. Ask a student with loans up 
the ying yang, and you might get 
some fingers scratching the back 
of their head. 

The concept of consolidation 
comes in with interest rates that 
correlate to your loan. So, if you 
have a student loan with an inter- 




est rate of 6.8 percent (which is 
where the rates are now, a record 
high since 2001) and you decide 
to consolidate your loan, your in- 
terest payments will remain the 
stung, regardless ot whether or not 
interest rates fluctuate. Ifyou don't 
know how to consolidate, then you 
may be stuck with an interest rate 
that will screw you until you are 
50.. .if you're lucky. 

According to a USA Today article 
on loans suffocating students, the 
majority of students are not con- 
cerned with their loans until after 



they graduate, when the average 
loan debt in the United State is at 
an overwhelming $20,000. A per- 
son who consolidates their loan at 
6.8 percent and pays off the debt in 
30 years is looking to pay around 
S27,()0u in interest. 

With debts, these graduates will 
be struggling to buy a home, start a 
family, ami prepare lor (heir retire- 
ment And I can tell you now that 
social security and welfare is prob- 
ably not going to exist. In the same 
article it also stated thai heavy debt 
will prevent a lot of young adults 



from starting businesses. Entre- 
preneurial ventures might not be 
an option for those who will have 
money to invest into debt. 

This is not the early 80s, where 
a full-time summer job could pay 
two-thirds of the school bill. We 
live in a time where education is 
valued so highly that we could 
spend our lives paying it off and 
more than likely benefit nothing 
academically from it.

all the fun is. We not only watch 
people who suck at singing, but 

seem to really suck at life. And if 

anyone doesn't know the equa- 
tion to reality TV, it is: Messed up 
PeopIe= Good television. Examples 
are Paris Hilton, "The Real World," 
"The Surreal Life" and the entire 
I. ifetime Channel. 

So you've got two options go- 
ing into this thing. You can either 
suck so bad that you make it or you 
can be so good that you make it. 
Now let me reiterate that making it 
means that you grabbed a hold of 
your 15 minutes by the horns, and 
really made it count. 

The first step you're going to 
need to do is get five people: one 
being your best friend, one being 
a parent, and three random people 
from the street. 

The reality is that your best friend 
and parent are the least credible 
here. They know you, and let's be 
honest- friends and family more 
than likely suck at being truly hon- 
est to your face. 

The three random people are ac- 
tually banking on your first irhpres- 
sion. You will then commence by 



singing\nurhesi or worst. The test 
here is to A-- see how you stand 
singingwise, and B-- see whether 
or not you got random people as 
part of your experiment. 

If you're not outgoing, alpha, 
or obnoxious then you're prob- 
ably not going to he on TV Sing- 
ing is half the battle, but your aura 
could be more important. Any- 
thing and everything superficial 
will more than likely make it on 
to television, ;is opposed to a nice 
person with a great head on their 
shoulder. Who wants to see that? 

Once you've established your 
greatness, whether sucky or good, 
you must then create an alter 
ego. Or you must already obtain 
a quality that sticks out, whether 
it's your looks or your personality. 
You want to be memorable. 

Here are some key words that 
you should take into your'Ameri- 
can Idol" Vocabulary: charisma, 
smile, and mass vs. weight (some 
people are externally heavy in 
weight, while others though small, 
like Tom Cruise, carry a lot of in- 
ternal mass. It's an energy thing). 
Words lor (he sucky includes: cos- 



gg^gjggl 



tume, swearing, and a foreign ac- 
cent. If you can combine all three 
ingredients then you could be 
heading towards the jackpot. 

I hope this, has encouraged all of 
you to try out for "American Idol." 
It's not only for people whoare 
good, but mostly dedicated for the 
Americans who "want to be. Don't 
forget that politics are included, so 
this season, if you are a male, you 
probably won't win. I guess I'm go- 
ing for sucky.

The date is Sept. 11,2001. The

lot to help keep us safe. Our uni- 
versity police department is open 
24/7, even on holidays. 

Here are some of the services 
our police and security officers will 
provide as outlined on their web- 
page http://wmv.phyplt.ipfw.edu/ 
POLICE/Pservice.htm: 
• lump starts for stranded 



• Unlock service for individ- 
uals who have locked their keys in 

• An escort service, available 
24 hours a day. 

• A campus wide emergency 
telephone system monitored 24 
hours a day. 

• Free engraving of social se- 
curity or ID numbers on personal 
property. 

• Central repository for lost 
and found articles. 

• Crime prevention lectures 
and seminars for new staff and slu- 

To contact the University Police 
Department, call 481 -6827 for 
non-emergencies and 481-6911 
for emergencies. For the escort 
service (remember this is for any 



time of the day or night!) call481- 

6900. May 1 suggest that you pro- 
gram those numbers into your 
cell phone? 

"What if I don't have a cell phone," 
youask? Notaproblem. If there is 
an emergency, just dial 1691 1 into 
any campus phone. And remem- 
ber, at a pay phone all you have to 
do is pick up the receiver and dial 
911, no coins required. 
Another system to be aware of 
and take advantage of is the cam- 
puswide emergency telephones. 
These are the poles with blue 
lights. Each of these have a red 
button on tliern. all you have to 
do is push that red button to be 
connected to the Police and Safe- 
ty Dispatcher. 

There are 14 of these outside, 
placed near sidewalks and park- 
ing lots. You can take notice of 
their location as you walk around 
campus, or pull out your student 
handbook ami look at the map on 
page 203. 

There are also emergency phones 
in all of the elevators, except for 
the library, which ring into Police 
and Safety as soon as receiver is 
picked up. 

lake advantage' of these services; 
they are there just for us! Hope- 
fully this information will dimin- 
ish the cases of "that feeling" on 
campus.

Campus Police Contibutes 
to School's Safe Reputation 



Need an escort? Book bag sto- 
len? Something just doesn't look 
right? No need to fear, Campus 
Police are here! 

Campus Police, which started 
out as Campus Security, has been 
a service at IPFW as long as the 
campus has been around. 

In 1971, Indiana gave the uni- 
versity the authority to have a po- 
lice department on campus. 

"That's when the university 'po- 
lice became police officers and 
had to go through the appropri- 

training to have police powers," 
said Lauren DenHartog, Chief of 
Police at IPFW. 

According to DenHartog, schools 
are not required to have a security 
department, although most do. 

"Safety on campus is a big is- 
sue, so as a police department we 
could provide the whole service 
rather then just the security de- 
partment," said DenHartog, "We 
can actually take police actions. 
We have city wide jurisdiction. We 
are a police department." 

Beyond the benefits of respond- 
ing to accidents, theft, criminal 
charges, and disturbances, Cam- 
pus Police holds classes includ- 
ing: RAD {Rape Aggression De- 
fense), Mini RAD, SAFE, and TIPS, 
an intervention program for peers 
to recognize when people need 

These programs are ongoing 
and can be found by contacting 
the Campus Police website. 

"AJ1 together, we have a very safe 
campus," DenHartog said, "We are 
very lucky. 1 would like to think it's 
because we are here." 




IPFW Police Officer, Lynn Armstrong, escorted s 



IPFW has only two rapes and 
very few aggravated assaults on 
record during the past 30 years. 
Th,e campus also has 15 officers 
patrolling the 600 acres 24/7. 

"Having a safe campus has its 
down fall. You let your guard down 
because people think it won't hap- 
pen here. But things can happen 
here," said DenHartog. 



To avoid becoming another 
statistics, DenHartog offers these 
precautions: lock the car, walk as 
a group at night, stay in the light, 
and don't forge to report suspi- 
cious activity. 

"There are always a percent of 
reports that don't get reported. If 
we don't know about it, we can't 



it. Maybe we can't solve every- 
thing, but maybe that would tie 
into something else that we know 
about and the pieces would start 
fitting together and it would help 
us. It's like a puzzle," DenHartog 

The main uses students find for 
Campus Police are calls reporting 
accidents, stolen items, unlocked 



Dylan's Influence Reflected 
in Decades of Musicians 



the r 

Music is thrown at us through 
television commercials, movie 
soundtracks, and even out the 
windows of cars as we walk down 
the streets. We recognize some of 
it, because the sound had a certain 



lives. Then there an 

when we disregard something 

we've heard before, because that 

own lives. Everyday, we hear music 
that has had tremendous meaning 
to the lives that took place before 

On September 5th, Fort Wayne 
was given the chance to witness an 
American master in concert at the 
Memorial Statium. 

Over the course of a legend- 
ary career spanning four decades, 
Bob Dylan has established him- 
self as one of the most celebrated 
American musicians, authors, and 
poets of his time. Through songs 
like'Blowin' in the Wind" and "The 



Times They Are a-Changin," Dylan 
created the music which served 
as a soundtrack for the civil rights 
movement and the protests again si 
the Vietnam War. 

Many of the musicians that made 
the 1960's such a remarkable time 
in American music barely made it 
out of the decade alive. , 

Deaths caused by excessive life- 
styles and drug use robbed future 
generations from witnessing the 
live performances of Jimi Hendrix. 
Janis Joplin, and )im Morrison, all 
within a year and all at the age of 

However, Dylan endured and 
lived through the Go's and secured 
his place as the reluctant voice of 
the 20th century's most peculiar 
generation. 

"People today are still living off 
the table scraps of the sixties. They 
are still being passed around - the 
music and the ideas," Bob Dylan. 

The 1960's have always 
been characterized by a genera- 
tion's intense political activism. 
Issues of race, class status, gender, 
and war each came to the fore- 
front of public scrutiny at various 
points throughout the decade. 
Passion over these issues created a 
whirlwind of public outcry, result- 



with a desire 
for change so strong that the U.S. 
has not seen anything like it since, 
Dylan's music was a direct result of 
litis inflamed and worrisome time 
in American history. 

From the 1970's on, it 
would be difficult to find an Amer- 
ican musician who hasn't been in- 
fluenced by Dylan in one way or 
another. 

His catalog of work and noto- 
riety has put him in a position as 
a living authority on American 
music. Dylan's musical influence 
stretches across the genres, and 
includes everyone from R.E.M.'s 
Michael Stipe, Wyclef lean, the 
Black Crowes' Chris Robinson, and 
Green Day's Billie loe Armstrong. 

"He showed me how to stuff as 
many lyrics into one song as you 
can get. 'Like a Rolling Stone' was 
one of the first songs that got into 
that feeling of abandonment." 
Armstrong said, "It sounds like 
he's talking to some trust-fund col- 
lege kid who came up and had the 
world on a silver platter and then 
he suddenly has to fend for him- 
self, has a lot of growing up to do. 
One of the reasons he's so legend- 
ary is that he's so human." 

Dylan's work has encompassed 



a wide variety of musical styles, 
ranging from folk, to country/ 
blues, jazz, rockabilly Gaelic bal- 
lads, to rock 'n' roll, and back to 
folk. 

His musical versatility and long 
career have allowed him to leave 
his mark on American history in 
a variety of ways. The only things 
about Dylan that remains con- 
stant are his originality, willing- 
ness to experiment artistically. 
and his desire to make the listen- 
er think. 

"There's this yearning — there's 
a sort of restless quality because 
he's always questioning things, 
every song," said Ed Simons, of 
The Chemical Brothers. "A lot of 
music feels like it's a complete 
statement, and to me, that's why 
I like Bob Dylan — it always feels 
like there's more." 

Dylan maintains a busy sched- 
ule, playing roughly 100 dates per 

Since the 1990s he and his band 
have been on a self described 
"Never Ending Tour." Dylan's 
concert at Memorial Stadium will 
only be his sixth concert, since 
the August 29th release of his 44th 
and most recent album, "Modern 
Times." 



vehicles ami personal escorts. 

"We would rather have you call 
for a personal escort then have to 
write a report and investigate thai 
something happened to you be- 
cause you didn't have one," Den- 
Hartog said, "Keeping the campus 
safe is a team effort." 



Invincible 
Disney Flick 



"Invincible" is the newest in 
a long line of feel-good Disney 
flicks. Starring Marky Mark ... er, 
Mark Wahlberg ... Greg Kinnear, 
and Elizabeth Banks, it's really no 
different than the one-word, feel- 
good, athletic movies that have 
come before it (namely "Hoo-

It was sort of slim pickings this 

Nothing piqued my interest; so 
I asked someone else to choose 
the movie and I just tagged along 
for the ride. 

Overall, I wasn't swayed one 
way or the other. 

"Invincible" is the story of 
Vince Papale (WahlbergJ, a bar-

Papale is a 30-year-old that

Lady Dons Win USC Rematch 



Press release courtesy of 
1PFW Athletics Department 



Fort Wayne, IN- TWo 
second-half goals lifted IPFW 
to a 2-0 win over Utah Valley 
State on Saturday night at the 
Hefner Soccer Complex. 

The contest was a rematch 
of the 2005 United Soccer 
Conference Championship 
which the Mastodons won, 
2-1 last November. 

Utah Valley State carried 
most of the action in the first 
period. The Wolverines put 
four shots on goal, but IPFW 
keeper senior Shannon Lynn 
turned them all aside, includ- 
ing a great save on a blast by 
UVSC's Megan Barrett from 
about eight yards out. 

It was Lynn who initiated 
the scoring for IPFW in the 
second half. The keeper 
punted the ball well past the 
m id hoi d line to a waiting Jen- 
ny Thornton. The junior mid- 
fielder got the ball ahead to 
freshman Ashley Hansbury, 
who turned on the jets. Hans- 
bury eluded a defender and 
toed up a shot from about 
20 yards that just slipped un- 
der the crossbar, past UVSC 
keeper Kelley Thompson. 

IPFW kept up the momen- 
tum. At the 67:49 mark, it was 
Hansbury sending a perfect 
ball to a streaking Danielle 
Orlandella. The sophomore 
forward kicked back across 
her body and found the up- 
per left-hand portion of the 

Lynn turned aside two more 
Wolverine shots in the half to 
preserve the shutout. 

Both teams now stand at 2- 
2-0 after the match, but IPFW 
leads the United Soccer Con- 
ference West Division. It was 
the first conference match 
played this season. 

The Mastodons will have a 
week off now before hosting 
Morehead State next Sunday 
at the Hefner Soccer Com- 
plex. Match time is 1pm.
