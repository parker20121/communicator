CONVO DEBATE BOMBS

"A put-tin" was the voiced 
□pinion of the so-called debate 
between Phillip Luce and Leonard 
Wcinglass last Tuesday at the 
Ret jonnl Campus.. .and it was.

Luce to the clean up by the janitors. 

pening statements from both sides 
followed by questions from the au- 
dience. My history class the day 
before was more interesting than 
the Farce that was presented. 

Luce opened the evening 
spouting on "a period of crisis" 
now in the U.S.. He felt we needed 
less government, less control, and 
the possibility of individuals acting 
collectively and also separately 
by designing ways THEY want to 
live. 

Weinglass retaliated that a re- 
turn to the old of rejecting all gov- 

of the present structure of our so-

that they can be made good. 

The question-answer period 
Tit in with the rest of the "class- 
tinner defined the difference of the 
Right and Left as the Right moving 
individually and the Left going on 
in a group, like a national movement. 

Luce felt the difference was 
stronger. He does not trust the pro- 
posed Leftist government nor the 
government of today. He would not 
attempt to overthrow the government 
but rather change the things he can

PIT 

to be 
theatre center 

Beginning next year 
the Purdue-Indiana Thea- 
tre, on the Fort Wayne 
Campus, will serve as a 
clearing house and regional 
center for live theatre tour- 
ing groups in the northeast 
part of the state. PIT is 
one of four such groups 
participating in the pro- 
gram, and will concentrate 
on this section of the state 
as its area. 

All of this is being 
made possible by the Ind- 
iana State Arts Com- 
mission, which has allo- 
cated SISO.OOO for the pur- 
pose of exposing young- 
sters to the live theatre. 
The funds will be given 
directly to the schools at 
which the live theatre will 
perform, and will help to 
cover the expenses through 
this subsidy program. 

Professor 0. Franklin 
Kenworthy, leader of PIT, 
is one of four men in the 
stale who is serving as 
advisory board overlooking 

The idea behind the 
theatre is to give as many 
grade school children as 
possible a chance to see 
the live theatre in action, 
and therefore cultivate a 
taste for it. 

Principals wishing to 
have the live theatre 
appear at their schools will 
contact Professor Ken- 
worthy, and he will instruct 
them in how to go about 
getting the funds.

The academic back- 
grounds of the new 
appointees are as follows: 

Dr. Beineke, who 
began his Purdue employ- 
ment in 1965, received his 
bachelor's degree at Pur- 
due University and both 
his Master's degree and 
Ph.D. at the University of 
Michigan, all in mathe- 
matics.

the Purdue staff in 1964,
