Ticket Gets Sheriff in Heap Of Trouble 



"Everywhere 1 go I 
read about, hear about, 
and see about problems 
of the police and sec- 
urity and justice on 
college campuses. I 
was here on the campus 
15 minutes and got a 
i&gt;6 ticket. ]}Jow I know 
where justice is being 
donei'ight here" spouted 
Sheriff Joe Higgins at 
his two performances in 
P.I.T. theater last 
Tuesday, 

Sheriff Higgins who 
arrived at our campus 
Honday, parked in the 
student parking lot so 
he could atop into trom5 
to see his good friend 
Mr. Lou Gulp. After his 
visit he v;nF; heading for 
a luncheon when he re- 
appeared in Mr. Gulp's 
office waving a S6 
ticket. He was fined 
for: failure to reg- 
ister vehicle, parking 
in a student parking 
area, parking by a yel- 
low curb, and blocking 
a crosswalk. When asked 
what he thought of the 
security system he sim- 
ply said, "Fantastic." 
Is he going to pay the 
ticket? "You bet I am 
'cause i broke the law" 
he said, "But the snow 
covered the yellow 
curb" he added. But 
tlBi left for his lunch- 
eon and was heard mat- 
tering "I'm in a heap a 
trouble ! " 



Sheriff Higgins, the 
famous Lodge Sherifr, 
talked on "Life in Tel- 
evision Land." oheriff 
Hig ins feels that TV 
land is really d adat 
the moment. It fails 
in one big place — tijey 
don't want profession- 
alism as much as star- 
dom nowadays. 

"It's the most fa- 
mous business of t,tihe 
world l&gt;5it TV land is 
gasping," said the She- 
riff. "I'm glad 1 have 
my college education 
because 1 can go back 
to the campus and teach 
if there aren't any 
jobs on TY left." 

One of the interes- 
ting facts aboutoheriff 
Higgins besides being 
born early one morning 
and being raised alter- 
nately across his Mo- 
ther's and Fathej:'s 
knee, is ttkt he dr6ve 
a Dodge before he got 
the part on the com- 
mercial- He now owns a 



Dodge 1968 red Pol^ra. 
When asked what he 
thought of college kids 
today he said "I'm IOOa' 
in front of you, beside 
yo J , and behind you. 
•-^o yoiir own t ling. 
Thppe ' s nothing wrong 
with you yoiing people." 
The bife surpria of 
the evening for Sheriff 
Higi.';ins was when he was 
presenteda proclamation 
by t:ie staff of the"IU- 
PU GOMMUIMiGATOK" which 
read, "This is to ct;rti- 
fy t at .sheriff Joeilig- 
gins has been appoin:^ed 
honorary oergeant a at 
Arms for t' e "Indiana- 
Purdue GOllMUNiGATUK, " 
t^e official carap" 
newspaper; given this 
tenth day of March in 
the yt'ar of our Lord 
1970.'" iie ti.en turned 
to the audience and 
said, "If any of sa- 
fety and security are 
present, I now declare 
a 48 hour conner.ty &gt;.on 
all parking tickets!"
