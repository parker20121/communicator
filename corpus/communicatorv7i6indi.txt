'. Lane's persistent 12 years of lecturing, writing, and organizing committees to 
j prompt Congress to re-open the investigation into the death of John F Kennedy 
; show him to be a man whose convictions are enduring. 

The history of the past decade and a half in this country is filled with 
government lies, bureaucratic bumbling, irresponsibility, and sonetiomes total 
■ disregard for propriety and the principles this nation was founded on. Lane's 
! remarks here Tuesday painfully reminded us of the extent of such irresponsibility.

It is ironical that a private citizen, not the press, not a Supreme Court Justice,

in Vietnam.

Chancellor Donald Schwartz is m 
administrative head and an objective ovbservor would have to give him good 
grades on what he has accomplished so far He has merged two business operatii 
into one and placed 
administrative departi 
are also merged. 

This alone would speak well of him. It is not easy to merge things around here 
. Just ask the faculty. It has been nearly two years since the presidents told them to 
reorganize into one governing body, but two separate senates still exist. 

What Don Schwartz has made very clear to everyone on campus is that he 
knows what he wants and he intends to get it His operating style is hard to swallow 
for a university that likes to move very, very slowly. So naturally there are critics 
'. who complain about the chancellor's manner of doing things. No doubt about it, he 
is a man who gets things done. 

Isn't that what we all said we wanted back in the spring of 1974?
