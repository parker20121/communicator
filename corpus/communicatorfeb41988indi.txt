Presidents visit 

Management agreement reviewed 



IPFW helps both lU and Purdue 
University advance their missions 
Purdue President Steven Beering said 
Tuesday. 

"The number of students 
who might live in dorms is 
much smaller than (he total 
enrollment would suggest. ' ' 

Stausn C. BaerloQ 

"Purdue University has a responsi- 
bility beyond its immediate campus 
constituency. We define our commu- 
nity as l&gt;olh state and worldwide. Fort 
Wayne is the second largest city in the 
state. We can do urban programs that 
can't be done in a small town like 
Bloomington or West Lafayette, We 
can be more available to people and 
assist business and industry That's 
why I'm excited about the possibilities 
in Fort Wayne " 

lU President Tom EhrUch agreed. 
"lU's three missions, academic dis- 
tinction, access to quality education to 
the citizens of the slate, and economic 
growth are all reinforced by Fort 
Wayne," 

The two presidents were in Fort 
Wayne to discuss the management 
agreement by which lU and Purdue 
run IPFW The pair met with stu- 
dents, faculty, and staff groups 
throughout the day and fielded 
questions regarding IPFW, 

Both presidents questioned the 



desirability of building dorms on the 
IPFW campus, 

"Most students here live in town as 
members or heads of families, or as 
divorced mothers with children. The 
nuniber of students who might live in 
dorms is much smaller than the lotal 
enrollment would suggest If IPFW 
were to reach the 'critical mass' of 
students then we IBcering and 
Ehrlich) would support bringing for- 
ward a proposal to the Higher Educa- 
tion Commission to build dorms," 
Beering said, 

Ehrlich was also skeptical, Ehrlich 



said both univcrsilics needed other 
types of buildings more than dorms, 
Ehrlich also predicted that building 
dorms would lead lo a two-class sys- 
lem-those who live in dorms and 
those who do not. 

Others inquired about the adequacy 
ot the library, Beering responded that 
Purdue has disproporlionalely funded 
libraries, but the ever- increasing cost 
of materials has created a national 
problem. 

Beering dcscrit)cd the role of the 
university president as "an orchestra 

ader-nnt a micrnmanagcr " When 



asked If he micro-managed the color 
issue, Beering responded he was 
merely giving Wallace his opinion on 
the issue. Beering also said, he per- 
mitted IPFW to use blue and white for 
athletics. 

Both presidents appeared to view 
IPFW favorably When asked, Beering 
refused lo name one negative charac- 
teristic about IPFW. Ehrlich said he 
worried that IPFW was not as in- 
depth in liberal arts as he wished. 
Ehrlich also said he worried that 
IPFW was not as visible in Fort 
Wayne as he would have liked.

Modernization 

Proposals include suggestions for buildings 



Edilor-M \vIt: nU u Ihr third of a 
ttriti of anieUi can-Hng prapvH-d plant 
to modemiir ihr IPFW ramput. 

Proposals to construct new buildings 
and enlarge present facilities at IPFW 
are included in the Chancellor's Task 
Force committee to modernize the 
campus. 

One new building would be con- 
structed at the Crescent Avenue State 
Road 37 entrance, A U-shaped drive 
would complement the building, which 
would house administrative offices at 
the apex. The Registrar and other 
administrative departments would 
transfer from Kettler Hall lo the 
proposed facility. 

The construction of this building 
would enable Kettler Hall to have 
more classrooms rather than 
admi nisi rat ion offices 

Another proposed building would 
house engineering and technology. 



This building, planned next to a stu- 
dent plaza and replacing parking be- 
tween the Classroom-Medical Building 
and Neff Hall, would be used almost 
exclusively for engineering and tech- 
nology classes Neff Hall, which for- 
merly housed these classes, would 
become a regular classroom building, 
forfeiting its computer terminals and 
drafting rooms 

The fine arts building, for which 
funding has been approved, is no 
longer a proposal. This building which 
will be constructed behind the Athletic 
Center Building, will house a 300-seat 
auditorium replacing Ihc current 
Purdue-Indiana Theatre in Kettler 
Hall, 

Another addition lo the proposed 
modernization would be the creation 
of dormitories tentatively located t&gt;e- 
hind the new fine arts building. Four 
buildings in the shape of a square 
would make up the dorm site, creating 
a commons or plaza in the center 

Also included in the proposals are 



additions to Walb Memorial Union and 
the Athletic Center The expanded 
Athletic Center would include a 
swimming pool, 

A final proposed structure on the 
master plan is named University Club 
This would be a place where faculty 
could meet for lunch, conversation, 
and meetings According to Matthew 
Kubik, associate professor of civil and 
architectural engineering, faculty 
currently have nowhere to gather on 
campus, whereas most colleges have 
clubs or meeting places for them. This 
building would be constructed behind 
the Athletic Center parking lots. 

Additional parking l^etween the ex- 
isting Athletic Center parking lots and 
the proposed University Club has been 
suggested by Kubik, 



The Fort Wayne River Grecnway 
Project may possibly merge with the 
university's plans to beautify the St. 
Joe River banks. Proposals for the 
east side of the river include an eight- 
foot-wide boardwalk running the 
length of the university Fort Wayne 
already has the property rights within 
25 feet of the river. 

According to Kim Bowman of the 
Fort Wayne Parks and Recreation 
Department the city would nol remove 
the parking lots near the river on the 
IPFW side to do this. If the university 
follows through with its proposals, 
however, the parking lots next to the 
river will be replaced with a picnic 
area, amphitheatre, and research 
tower

Mascot Mania 

What is a mastodon? 



It appears that the student body 
does not particularly care for the 
mastodon as mascot. 

According to a survey conducted 
by Dr. Joel Rivers of the psycho- 
logical sciences department, sixty- 
four percent of students polled 
would elect to change the mascot. 

Well, who wouldn't? 

There arc several reasons why 
Ihe mastodon should not symbohze 
IPFW, 

• Mastodons are extinct. One 
cannot even go to the zoo and see 
one. 

• Not everyone knows exactly 
what a mastodon is. It is more like 
a mammoth or an elephant. 

• Mastodons are bulky. They 
can't move very fast or very well. 

• Not only are mastodons 
physically slow, there also seems to 
Be some concern about their men- 
tal capacities. Just how intelligent 
were tnese animals? 

Perhaps it is time for another 
referendum to choose an official 
school mascot- The IPFW Bears 



would be nice. Bears are strong, 
powerful, and seem to have suf- 
ficient mental capabilities. 

Of course. IPFW could forsake 
animals altogether and adopt 
Knights as the name of its teams. 
Unfortunately Fort Wayne already 
has a high school team with that 
name. 

U one wanted to stick with some- 
thing in the •'extinct" category, the 
brontosaurus would be perfect. The 
brontosaurus. however, does not 
convey the image IPFW would like 
to project, especially since the av- 
erage dinosaur had a brain the size 
of a walnut, 

Considering the university now 
wants the river to be the focal point 
of the campus, perhaps a sea far- 
ing mascot would be more appro- 
priate. Poseidon, the Greek god of 
the sea, would fit in admirably. 

Naturally, after a referendum, 
any decisions made would have to 
be presented to President Beering, 
who would likely inform IPFW 
what its mascot is going to be, 



Macromanagement 

Is everything a local issue? 



Purdue University President 
Steven Beering and Indiana Uni- 
versity President Thomas Ehrlich 
met with representatives of various 
IPFW organizations on Tuesday 
The purpose of the meeting was to 
review the IPFW management 
agreement, though other topics 
were addressed. 

Both presidents should be com- 
mended for taking time to listen to 
the students. Issues were raised by 
various student speakers, and 
Beering and Ehrlich were at- 
tentive, responding to each 
speaker. 

The concerns raised by students 
were valid to IPFW Handicapped 
students' representatives asked 
about plans for accessibility to the 
new fine arts facility and to other 
buildings on campus. Anthropology 
students asked about the fate of 
liberal arts programs on the 
Purdue-controlled IPFW campus 
Both o( these points, however, were 
labelled as "local issues" by 
Beering. 

Local issues? Beering has ex- 
pressed concern about the colors 
this university uses, yet he was 
noncommittal about the fact that 
expensive facilities such as the 
Athletic Center and other univer- 
sity buildings are Inaccessible to 
IPFW's handicapped student pop- 
ulation. He was not concerned that 



anthropology majors are worried 
liberal arts programs are suffering 
because of the management 
agreement These concerns may 
represent those of a small per- 
centage of the campus, but they 
were important enough for that 
percentage to desire audience with 
Beering and Ehrlich, 

When questioned about the mod- 
ernization plan, Beering again 
labelled this a local matter. Local? 
Doesn't Purdue control our fi- 
nances? According to the Purdue 
Exponent, it most certainly does. Is 
this multi-million dollar modern- 
ization plan such a drop in the big 
bucket of Purdue finances that 
. Beering can shrug it aside as being 
local? 

Beering and Ehrlich did address 
concerns regarding the lack of rec- 
ognition for IPFW, the lack of 
adequate resources in the Helmke 
Library, and the president's role in 
the running of a branch campus. 

Concerning the last point, 
Beering said his role was in mac- 
romanagement. not mi- 
cromanagement, and he views the 
Purdue system as similar to a 
Fortune 500 company. 

But as any Fortune 500 executive 
would know, spending millions of 
dollars for modernization would 
undoubtedly fall under the juris- 
diction of macromanagement.

Students' Government hands 

tied when attempting to help . I 




Students' Government is de- 
signed to give students a voice in 
matters important lo themselves 
and the university. Students' Gov- 
ernment votes on issues that con- 
cern students, sometimes prepar- 
ing referendums if it is unsure ex- 
actly what the student body wants. 

Unfortunately Students' Gov- 
ernment sometimes is impeded in 
its endeavors by outside sources 
such as the administration. 

Recently the IPFW Students' 
Government voted to the change 
parking between Neff Hall and the 
Classroom-Medical Building to AB 
parking after 5:30 p,m. The lot is 
currently A parking only. 

The University Resources Policy 
Committee has since overruled 
Students' Government's decision, 
claiming that children being 
dropped off or picked up from mu- 
sic lessons run the risk of getting 
hit by a student-driven car. 

A second case of the administra- 
tion undermining Students' Gov- 
ernment is the color issue. Stu- 
dents' Government passed a reso- 
lution calling for a referendum to 
establish IPFW colors. After the 
referendum, is which students 
chose blue and white for the school 
colors. President Beering informed 
IPFW that blue and white could not 
be the "official" school colors. 
Students' Government was again 
overruled. 

What's the point of having a Stu- 
dents' Government if everything it 



resolves can be overridden by a 
committee or figurehead? 

The URPC has only two student 
members in a twelve-member 
committee. One sixth of the mem- 
bers are students This deplorable 
ratio is repeated in almost every 
committee in which students are 
allowed to participate. 

To make matters worse, most of 
the students on the committees are 
appointed by the Students' Gov- 
ernment president, giving him ab- 
solute power to decide who will be 
represented. 

Obviously some clear-cut guide- 
lines are needed to enable Students' 
Government to do its job. It is im- 
possible for Students' Government 
to operate with someone forever 
waitmg in the wings to undo what- 
ever tasks are accomplished. 

Perhaps this explains the Stu- 
dents' Government's apathy toward 
the forum with President Ehrlich 
and President Beering. Although 
nearly half of the menibers of Stu- 
dents Government attended, none 
of them asked questions or ad- 
dressed IPFW's needs or concerns. 
Possibly Students' Government felt 
nothing they could say would 
change anything. If that's the case, 
what are they doing posing as rep- 
resentatives of the students? 

The administration must learn to 
allow students to voice concern on 
campus issues. Students' Govern- 
ment cannot function with the ad- 
ministration sabotaging its 
progress.

Review 



Before we get lo the al- 
bums, here's a word about 
concerts. There is a scene 
happening in Fori Wayne. 
and it can be found Sunday . 
at the Seventh Level, a.k.a. 
Cheeres in the Hallmark 
Inn on Washington Blvd. 



The nightclub showcases 
some of the finesl in un- 
derground and alternative 
live music. The Flaming 
Lips took the stage last 
week, and played a mind- 
shattertng psychedelic re- 
view. The previous week 



featured Defenstration and 
Fetchin' Bones, and earlier 
shows included Naked 
Raygun, the Slammin' 
Walusi's, and Dead Milk- 
men. This week the Necros 
will take the stage, so slop

Themtetves lo Death"

When you first listen to 
the Housemartins, it's easy 
to dismiss them as light, 
flighty. British pop. Their 
acousiic-driven melodies 
are theatrically droll, and 
singer P. D. Healon's voc- 
als arc so foppishly sing- 
songy they come across as 



Martin surprising in Hughes movie 



Review 



"Oh, boy, here we go 
again," I thought as I en- 
tered the Holiday theater to 
see John Hughes' new 
movie, "Planes, Trains, and 
Automobiles." I figured I 
was committed lo silting 
through W-plus minutes of 
Steve Martin's unappealing 
wild-and-craiiness just lo 
see the handiwork of 
Hughes. I was delightfully 
surprised. 



I knew John Hughes 
would entertain me. After 
all. he wrote and directed 
such recent classics as 
"The Breakfast Club," 
"Sixteen Candles," "Pretty 
in Pink," and cull favorites 
like "Wierd Science" and 
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off. " 

1 wasn't so sure, however, 
that Martin would work 
well with Hughes' brand of 



humor He did. 

Hughes and Martin, along 
with a wonderful John 
Candy l"Splash," 
"Stripes"), work well to- 
gether to make this a hu- 
morous-yel-louching story 
of two men going home, 

This film is extremely 
well crafted Hughes has 
matured both in subject 
matter and direction. The 
images framed by director 
of photography Don 
Peterman (who shot 



"Flashdance." "Splash," 
"Star Trek IV, ' and many 
others) are Immaculate. 
Most surprisingly, the act- 



mgSi 



s real. 



Steve Martin has cer- 
tainly proven himself with 

"Roxanne" and this suc- 
cessor, I have changed my 
mind about Martin as an 

"Planes, Trains, and 
Automobiles" (R: Multiple 
use of an extremely of- 
fensive word.)

Listen closely to the 
band's lyrics, however, and 
a strong sobering edge is 
revealed. The band runs the 
two facets inio o sly jux- 
taposition, ycl does so 
without sounding sarcastic 
or ironic. Songs like "The 
World's on Fire." "Johan- 
nesburg," and "You'd Bet-

statements that drive home, 
yet float on layers of har- 
monious optimism. 

Also included in the LP is 
a bonus 7 " single of "Car- 
avan of LoveAVhen 1 First

gles are sung a cappella; a 
liner note explains the 
Housemartins prefer to sing 



a cappella and apologize for

Singers to perform 
with the Philharmonic 



The IPFW singers will 
be performing Andrew 
Lloyd Webbers "Re- 
quiem" with the Fort- 
Wayne Philharmonic and 
Chorus Saturday, Feb. 6 at 
a p,m, at the Embassy, 

John Loessl. associate 
director of music and di- 
rector of the IPFW sing- 
ers, is pleased with Iheir 
progress since rehearsals 
began last fall. 

Loessi said Webber's 
work is more difficult for 
a chorus to learn than a 
"traditional" requiem. 
"It's really a challenge for 
the singers," he added. 

Andrew Lloyd Webber 
originally wrote the re- 
quiem lo be sung by a 
men's and boy's choir al 
his father's funeral, 
Webber is best known for 
his Broadway 

hits— "Cats," ■■Evita," 
"Jesus Christ, Superstar," 
and the current smash 
"Phantom of the Opera." 

The "awkward chord- 
ing" and high soprano 
parts make "Requiem" so 
arduous. Loessi said there 
are many different types 
of music contained in the 



ten sections of this mass 
for the dead. 

The torty-five EPFW 
singers comprise about 
forty percent of the sing- 
ers in Saturday nighfs 
three-quarter-hour per- 
formance. The singers 
began rehearsing with the 
orchestra and chorus last 
Wednesday,
