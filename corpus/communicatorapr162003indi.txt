Professor reflects on Columbine 



And unlike physical 
wounds of Columbine sur- 
vivors, the mental and emo- 
tional harm is still felt. Not just 
by the students and teachers, 
but by the entire community, 
IPFW Assistant Professor of 
Psychology Jeannie D. 
DiClementi explained, 

Sunday, April 20, will mark 
four years since two teen-age 
gunmen shot and killed 12 fel- 
low students, a teacher and 
then themselves in an act that 
"shocked" Ihe Denver area, 
IJit lernenti said. 

"People were stunned. 
People were shocked," 
DiClementi said. 

DiClementi, who has a

members of the community 
"were just starting to pour in 
all day," DiClementi noted. 

The shock waves that fol- 
lowed Ihe shootings were felt 
strongly by people who 
weren't inside the halls of 
Columbine when the killings

also had worked with Denver 
Police in victim's assistance. It 
was a job title she had also 
held with other agencies in the 
1980s. 

When the mass-murder 
took place at Columbine, 
DiClementi was asked to help 
assist those suffering psycho- 
logical pains. 

The next morning, victim 
assistance teams gathered at a 
church. From there, the teams 
went to other locations to 
speak with

DiClementi went to a com- 
munity center and then later to 

"We did one-on-onc and

"Nobody tell safe 
Nobody understood 
it, DiClementi said 

Students who 
spoke with her were 
confused. 

"They didn't

DiClementi added. 

There was a 
mixture of relief and 
survivor's guilt, both

"People were trying to 
figure them out. People who 
had known them didn t under-

whether it is dune in the name of religion or in the

fact that I'm able to interpret your 
something stupid does not in itself disprove your 
argument. So it is with the Bible You are able to 
make it sound silly, but it does not prove the Bible 
to be obsolete. 

You obviously do nut believe the Bible, so to 
offer examples from it would only serve to be 
fodder for your misinterpretations. Instead, I 
wouldofferlhatinall things, pmple are responsible 
for their actions. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold

Brian David Mitchell -.lute fli/.ibelh Smart, not 
Cod. 

Finally, it seems you believe the world would 
be a better place absent of religion, or the Bible. 
Please consider what you're frustrated with — the 
Bible, religion. You're not upset with evil people 
who do evil things' You're not upset with fathers 
who beat their children? You're not upset with 
mothers who drop their children into dumpsters? 
You're not upset with people who commit senseless 
killings? No, you're upset because we are not 
blaming these crimes on the Bible — that is laughable. 

Don't you wish it was as easy to find other 
things as it is to Find fault? 



What exactly is a religious 
fanatic? The mainstream defi- 
nition is someone who uses 
their religious beliefs to justify 
actions that a "normal"" person

Uneducated outrage

The recently printed an article 
entitled "You know what pisses

hardly know where to begin in 
refilling Ibis uneducated hash on 
Christianity. I can understand 
someone who has a rational argu-

all other religions, but when 
someone gin's olf on an illogical

Lastly, the incorrect usage of

one minute think that a

For the first time since 1

didn't pick up the last issue

reading that immediately,

Religion is a concept that

Religion not the problem 



In the April 9 Communicator there was 
an article that should have been called an 
Opinion By a staff writer. 

First of all, he starts off by attacking the 
Bible without understanding that this wacko 
was strange by Mormon standards and he 
was following the book of Mormon which is 
not a part of the Bible and was really a book of 
fiction that cost it s writer )oe Smith (one of 
the founders) his life. 

In all the instances he cited were wackos 
that look a little bit of reality and distorted its 
real meaning. 

Religion is not the problem its human 
psychology; When he doesn't have a clue 
when he talks of the human embryo and 



that is a 

matter of law not science or religion! No one 
can argue that it is not alive or not human. 
Am biology student can tell the difference a 
dead cell and a live cell and if the cell is dive 
it possesses life, period. 

He probably believes that we all popped 
out of a primordial stew by a chance combi- 
nation o! amino acids without any intelligent 
design. This is nol science by fact, this is reli- 
ginn by hypothesis. 

So lighten up and try to dispute the bible 
by reading many different versions al the 
same time You may be able to find Ihe truth 
in it as long as you open your closed mind.

of my file and use that in my 
classes," she said. Later, she pre- 
sented it in a conference.

alarms still affected her. The 
shooters had Set off fire alarms 
before the killings began, and 
they rang lor aboul six hours, 
DiClementi explained. 



Looking back, DiClemcnb 
remembers spending time in 
Columbine High School. She 
had been there to watch her 
daughler - who went to another 
high school - compete in 
gymnastics. 

"I'd been in Columbine 
High School on more than one 
occasion I saw the cafeteria and 
I've seen the library It's eerie to 
know I've been in that 
cafeteria," she said. 

Many more questions will 
be asked than answered, 
DiClementi considers. 

One hypothesis is they 
Were "budding anti-social per- 
sonality disorders like Ted 
Bundy " They lack a conscience 
and have a pattern of behavior 
involved violating norms and 
breaking rules, she explained. 

But she says they had to 
use a lot of planning to set the 
stage for 420 It look some Intel-

Trie nation wanted to find 
some thing or some one to 
blame for Columbine, but she 
feels it is a complicated question 
to answer While Marilyn 
Manson and violent video 
games were among the firs I to 
feel the fingers pointed, there 
were other reasons, she thinks. 

"People need something 
concrete to point at as the cause 
-because if we don't have that. 
we might have to point to 
ourselves. "she said. 

"I don't think there's any 
one person to blame. I don t 
think we'll ever fully under- 
stand it," DiClementi added. 

She believes schools are 
more vigilant aboul watching 
for weapons. She hopes they are 
keeping an eye on interaction 
between students. 

Even with more vigilance 
four years later, school shoot- 
ings still take place. 



Monday morning, one stu- 
dent was killed and four others 
were shot at a high school in 
New- Orleans. That incident is 
under investigation. 

Like Columbine and 
September 11. some situations 
are so unforeseen, it is difficult 
in prepare for them. 

"Nobody could ever plan lor 
something like Columbine. No 
matter how many other school 
shootings there were at other 
communities - they were other 
communities. Everybody had 
the mentality that it's not going 
to happen here, ""she said.

Documentary reinvention 'Bowling' hits a strike 



He gained notoriety with 
his gr.nni.t-bte.il. ing him "Roger 
and Me," which introduced a 
new style of documentary when' 
the filmmaker is actually a part 
ol Ihe movie. 

He recently became infa- 
mous for chastising the presi-

country's involvement wilh the 
current conflict in Iraq, 

The man Is Michael Moore, 
and his remarks .ihi.ui President

The Til m that won this honor was 

documentary called "Bowling 
for Columbine," and though it 
has been in theatres around the 
country for quite some lime, it 
only recently has been available 
at the Cinema Center in Fort 
Wayne. 

Before the film finishes its 
run In the Summit Citv. those 
interested in the idea ol gun

;* talked with many 
people who have something lo 
say about a country that is 
obsessed with violence, even 
though violent crime in the 
United States has gone down 
consistently for the past couple 
ol years. 

From sociology professors 
to a brother ol ,1 man convicted 
in the Oklahoma City bombing, 
to citizens of Columbine. 
Marilyn Man.son and finally 
National Rifle Association 
Piesidenl Charlton Heston, thev 

all had a chance to voice their

Columbine massacre, the United 
Stales had just initialed the 
largest bombing campaign in 

This introduclion, while 
selling Ihe atmosphere of Ihe 
him. alsi. sets a very ironic tone. 
The irony of the film serves as a 
comic relief that makes the 
intense and disturbing subject 
matter of the film more bearable 

The next pari shows Moore 
in a Michigan bank where they 
offer free rifles to any new cus- 

The bank employee tells Moore 
how the bank is a licensed 
firearms dealer and their large 
selection ol firearms is always 
kepi up withal least 500 rifles in 
the vault. After Moore received 
his gun, a different employee did 
nut see why it would be dangerous 
for a bank to carry hundreds ol 
firearms. 

Irony, such as in the bank is 
seen in the segment where 
Moore and a professor who 
wrote a book about the United 
States being in a state ol iear are 
walking in Los Angeles They 
walk by Ihe comer where Ihe Los 
Angeles riots began and talked 
about how the chance of

However, the media iru&gt;asos

more fear, even though Ihe smog 
and pollution 111 L A is far more 
dangerous than the residents of 
that neighborhood. 

After more analyzation ol 
the Columbine massacre and Ihe 
media frenzy that it spawned, 
Moore realized that above all 
else, rock artist Manson was 
blamed lor the behavior of the 



Columbine assailants, Moore 
interviewed Manson, who was 
calm and thoughtful about the 
incident. Manson remarked 
about how he was singled out 
because he represents every Ihing 
that thi.-e in power are fearful of 
lhat is that he does whatever he 
wants. This only re-enforced 
what had been said in the film 
until that point about our nation 
being gripped in fear. 

The United Stales was

something truly different from 
our society lhan others. There 
were no significant differences.

occurred when Moore realized 
that he had to talk to NRA 
President Heston. Moore wanted 
lo ask him about why il was after 
tragedies such as Columbine 
thai Heslon would visit these 
communities to gain support of 
his organization. Heslon, old

Dons double up on Eastern Michigan 



FORT WAYNE — The IPFW softball 
team swept a doubleheader from 
Eastern Michigan on Saturday at the 
IPFW softball field. 6-1 and 6-5. 

Freshman Beth Harmon (8-3) 
tossed a complete-game win in the 
opener and struck out four batters 
while allowing only two hits and one 
earned run in the victory. 

With the two wins. IPFW 
improved to 12-15, while Eastern 
Michigan dropped to 3-24 overall. 

The Mastodons got things started 
the bottom of the second inning 
wnen IPFW's Crystal Fisher doubled to 
left field with one out. Laura Randolf 
then moved Fisher over to second base 
on a ground out to the second baseman. 

Heather DeVore reached base on a 
dropped pop fly by Eastern Michigan's 
Deanna Wisnieski, scoring Fisher to 
take an early 1-0 lead. 

The Mastodons' bats broke loose 
in the bottom of the third, scoring three 
runs after the Eagle's first baseman 
dropped the throw from pitcher Maria 
Olterbacher, which allowed the second 
run of the game to score. IPFW capital- 
ized on three more base hits as they 
expanded their lead lo 4-0.

In the bottom of the second with

Women and the Master Mormon 




lell kind of Master* was thai? 

I'm not too sure about the entire thing 
because 1 didn't watch much of it at all. Hell, I'm 
not a golf fan, so the best part was mostly when 
Day 1 was rained out But seriously, what 
happened after that? 

Firsl you had the Femi-Nazis running buck- 
nutty around the place, all pissed off and revved up 
on something that most likely resembles heroin. 

Okay, there are |ust Mimu traditions that need 
to stand. Sometimes, ch.inye is not the best idea. 
llS very rare, but here we have an example 
Augusta National is a men-only club, it always has 
been. Do you see Mark O'Mcara or Tiger Woods 
wanting to join your Belly Crocker tooling Club? 

I think not. 

It's bad enough in my opinion that we are 
actually letting AniV.i Sor.n-nm on (he PGA tour. 
But, at the same lime, the LPI .a refuses lo allow a 
man on tour? See, Title IX is a good thing in the 
world that priirrinleil equality for both genders in 
the sports world Women should be able to play 
the same sports as men, but when you have your 
own league, why bother? 

Male athletes know their place. Jeff Foster

over and Mike Weir has already walked off int.'

Cobi Jones went and picketed to be part of Ihe 
Women's USA Soccer team, I'd tell his dread- 
locked-ass to go home and fi* the car or some- 
thing. It's just the way it is, stop complain- 
ing and do something useful with your life. 

And hey, while I'm picking ihi' Masters apart, 
let's not forget our fabulous winner. Although I'm 
not sure how you can be from Canada and still 
consider yourself a winner. Yes. that's right, I hale 
Canada. People always ask mi' kvhv. and I have no 
reason to hate them But. 1 also have no reason to 
like them. So why bother" It's easier to dislike than 
to like. 

Another thing that 1 found [usl great was the 
fact that Weir and Len Maltiace played superb golf 
the entire fourth round, then made like a bunch of 
second -graders al Putt-Putt. 

That's right, 1 haven't watched loads of golf, 
but that was the worst playoff hole or hole period

Advrrlumg Manager 

When D.in and 1 decided to do our tide of 
fashion, the famou* words from Mark Twain 
came In mind, 'Clothes make Ihe man. Naked 
people have iinf&gt; or no influence on sodety." I 
believe he was right, but as lime has changed so 
have clothes and mindsets. 

My perception •'&lt; fashion it nut how a person 
dresses ll is lhat the clothes a person wears is an 
expression Ol who a person is on the inside, 
regardless of wh.il he/she looks like on the out' 
side 

As you can see by the picture of me, I do nol 
fall Into a lot of stereotypes that are supposed 10 
classify me as a person. The way that I am pic- 
tured is not the way that I am all of the time but it 
is a part of who 1 am Although 1 get a lot of criti- 
cism for the way that I dress and the music lhat I 



n important 



t give any 



s the person thai 1 have become and just n 
evolve into 



On days that I have meetings, I like to dress 

more like business casual, a long-sleeve dress 
shirt and dress pants. I get my meeting attire from 
places like Sears. JC. Penney and Marshall 
Field's 

Some days I have church or 
function where I am required to 1 
bought my last suit in lndy, so I c 
advice on when- to go aniund here 

The final category in fashion is shoes. I am 
the type of person who owns very few pairs of 
shoes. I own six pairs of shoes, three of which are 
tennis shoes; one blue, one black and one red, all 
to match most of my clothes. I own two pairs of 
dress shoes: one black, one brown. Finally, my 
shoe collection ends with a pair of sandals that 
rarely get worn because ol the wonderful weather 
here All but one pair I bought at Shoe Carnival (I 
think). 

Well, that is my look at fashion. To conclude, 
ar clothes so you will have an

fashion. What I wear depends on what is on r 
schedule. If I have .&lt; free day of just class and

Any good man or woman can realize lhat 
there are many different sides of fashion. See, not 
all of us spend our weekends and hard-earned 
cash falling into Ihe GAP. For some people, look- 
ing preppy enhances their self-respect or whatever. 



Fori 






n who I 



I'm sure that people who west khaki pants 
and polo shirls every day of the week are 
comfortable being themselves and for some rea- 
son they choose those clothes to do it in. But that's 
their deal, this is mine. 

See, there is no spring fashion as opposed to 
any other season to me, except I am more prone to 
wear shorts than in the winter. 

It's a pretty basic way to wear things lhat fit 
your personality. Hate lo be rude, but what some 
fashion experts say is "in-srylo," truly isn't. And 
why? Because there is no "in -style." What's "in- 
slyle" for each individual person is what he or she 
likes. 






■ thos

what I should wear? Do you see some of 
that stuff? 

But since the. i&gt; mv time to tell you about n 
different side of fashion and nol rant about idiols. 
let me tell you what I wear I'm not saying this is 
"in" or "out" or any stuff like that, because it's 
probably not to you. that's your call But it (or 
some reason you want In dress like me, here's 
what you do. 

First off, you have lo have ,1 hat I'm a h.it 
guy; 1 always have been. When I had the killer 
afro over the winter, I wasn't as prone lo wear .1 
hat unless II was my Boston Brums winter tut 
But now that the hair is gone, its back to Ihe Ir.i- 
ditional baseball caps. If you want lo be specific, 
go with a college hat made by Zephyr For one 
reason and one reason only: it's different. 
Everyone is wearing ihe throwbaeks now — it's 
sickening. Jump on ihe bandwagon and wear that 
ugly stuff like LeBron James. There is .1 reason old 
NBA and MLB learns changed Iheir logos — they 
were ugly. 

Asfarasshirlsgo.aT-shirl will do. Any kind 
really works, |usl depends on your personality, I 
like lo wear band shires the most because 1 like 
people's music and I like lo support them by pur- 
chasing their sluli and giving I In 01 money. Bui 
like 1 said, a T-shirt is a T-shirt. 

I'm not going lo wrile much about pants, 
becau.se they are what they are. Jeans, windpanls, 
shorts, whjii'i t-r. dude: they're |ii-l panlS. 

Shoes are Ihe same way, bill I do prefer my 
Chuck Taylor's. I make up a small minority from 
what 1 have seen. 

The odd combination nl punk and rock 
music mixed with sports as my favorite things 
have left me with what 1 think is a rather unique 
fashion. 

But whn really cares, they're |ust clothes. Do 
what you want and wear what you want. |usl be

Think pink. Pink sandals, pink skirls, 
pink shirts Ncedlos to say. pink is Ihe 
dominant color in everything style-wise 
this spring When pink invaded the fashion 
scene, it came in all forms from baby pink 
to deep coral. Anyone, yes, even redheads, 




lar partem will have people seeing spots- 
Yes, polka dots, in a" 
are making their m 
agaia The black and 
white duo can be figure 
nattering, depending on 
dot size. Larger body 
frames should find a 
smaller dot size more fig- 
ure nattering than a larger 
dot size. Smaller body 
frames can ideally 
both large and small dot 
sizes, but it is important for people 
to remember that the polka dot pat- 
tern will accentuate whatever part of 
the body it is worn on. So, if a person is 
through the midsection, they 
ould try a polka dot shirt, and 
II a person is lop heavy and slimmer 
through the hips, then she should try a skirt 
instead of a shirt. Also, with polka dots, 
people must remember that the fabric will 
affect the way the pattern fits the body. A 
clingy fabric, such as rayon or silk, might 
make the pattern less flattering to the eye as 
opposed to a cotton or spandcx blend, 
which looks good on everyone. 

They left and have now relumed: 
cargo pants. The once generally male pant 
is now making its way back into the 
women's fashion scene. The most popular 
cargo pants for this season have a para- 
chute look to them. Many of this 
cargo pants are carrying a parachute/mili- 
tary look with drawstring hem and ever- 
famous cargo pockets. 

When it comes to ; 
for women to let their femininity reign- 
While flat sandals are popular, the 1 1 IT to 
2" stiletto heel sandals arc also popular in 
girly colors such as pale pink and blue and 
striped patterns. While much of the jewelry 
is "organic," much of it is in feminine colors 
such as coral and turquoise. While 
turquoise is slowly fading out of style, it is 
still popular for the spring 
instead of buying two necklaces (one 
one turquoise) try buying a coral turquoise 
combo. 

The most girly fashion for this 
has to be the purses. This season, many of 
the purses ate being donned with flowers, 
butterflies and stripes and are being sold in 
fun colors meant to match the shoes.

Let's face it,

with the newest

America.

something along the lines of "The Pin

feature khaki ahoTtt (cargo pockets preferred) or 
long pants with sandals or even dUtTOned 
leather shoes. 

In the wide world of dress clothes, you will 
find more and more of the "barcode" pattern

fall fashion article last semes-

know that many of the retro

orange and brown. This was 
not something that I really 
cared for.

Where can you find all these different 
styles? The biggest name brands and the most 
up-to-date Styles with Ihebcsl selections in each 
are in Ihe higher lino department stores such as 
Marshall Field's. Von Maur and L.S. Ayrvs. Mid- 
line dcparimenl stores like J.C. Penney and Scars 
will carry these fashions loo, but possibly not the 
bigger name brands. Other smaller department 
stores like Stein Marl or T,J Maxx, have .1 fair 
selection at lower prices Specialty shops like 
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Eddie Bauer, Banana 
Republic. Structure (soon to be called Express 
for Men) and many others will have these styles 
in their own brands, so the selection won't be as 
big as you may find elsewhere. 

Whether or not these styles strike your 
fancy, or you are and always will be a "lee-shirt 
and jeans sorta guy," you cannot let the above 
hinder your individuality. Don'l let designer 
brands dictate who you are. Meanwhile, get nut- 
side, enjoy Ihe Fresh, cool spring air and let the 
new colors liven your senses!
