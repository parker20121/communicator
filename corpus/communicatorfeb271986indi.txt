By JAMES GARCIA 
Stall Writer 

IPFW and the Fort Wayne Fine Arts 
Foundation in a joint project have 
agreed to guarantee $25,000 each 
toward the budget for the first annual 
Forte Art Festival to be held this May. 

Frank Kenworthy, Assistant to the 
Vice-Chancellor, and a member of the 
executive committee for the festival, 
said most of the money has already 
been raised and he does not expect the 
university to appropriate any funds 
toward the festival. 

According to Elizabeth Franklin, 
director of the Forte Festival, money 
is being raised through corporations 
who agreed to underwrite the project. 
Franklin does not envision any need 
for IPFW to have to contribute to the 
budget. Franklin and Kenworthy 
emphasized most of the university's 
contribution to the budget will come in 
the form of in-kind services. 

Franklin is the second person to hold 
the position as director for the festival. 
Her job as administrative assistant to 
the vice- chancel lor for academic af- 
fairs is permanent, said Franklin. The 
festival is her first major respon- 
sibility in this capacity. 

IPFW students did not participate in 
the planning of the festival. The 
project's conception and subsequent 
planning was conducted entirely on an 
administrative level, said Kenworthy. 
Since then students have had an op- 
portunity to become part of the 
festival. Student's Government has 
been notified along with Community 
Arts Council at the Union Building, but 
no interest has been expressed. 

Kenworthy said Ihe decision to have 



the festival in May. after the regular 

school year has ended, came as a 
result of several factors, including 
potential parking problems, weather 
and Ihe fact that the festival's 
predecessor, held by the Fort Wayne 
community until 1973, was 
traditionally celebrated on or about 
Memorial Day weekend. Student at- 
tendance was not a primary factor, 
said Kenworthy. Yet no conscious 
effort was made to exclude student 
participation, he added. 

The festival is intended to "develop a 
cooperative event between campus 
and community," said Kenworthy. 

The executive committee for the 
festival is projecting that 40,000 people 
may attend. 

No admission fee will be charged, 
but donations will be accepted for 
festival buttons distributed as ad- 
vertisement for the festival by the 
contributing corporation to their 
employees. 

Artists who wish to display and sell 
their work will be required to pay a $50 
entry fee. Students who want to avoid 
these costs may include their work in 
the annual student-faculty exhibit and 
auction which will be conducted in 
conjunction with the festival events. 
The artwork will be sold at auction 
followingthe exhibit. 

IPFW's exclusive vendor, Service 
America, has agreed to allow non- 
profit organizations to sell concessions 
■ on campus. 

vAll proceeds from the festival will go 
jnto sustaining the effort in subsequent 
years, said Kenworthy. 



Chancellor search, a topic of senate discussion 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

Eleven applicants remain in con- 
tention for chancellor. 

The remaining applicants will be 
interviewed through conference calls 
and other means before the number is 
cut to six, said Joe Motherwell, student 
body president and member of Search 
and Screen Committee. 

"We'll know sometime in March who 
the finalists are," said Motherwell. 
Each chancellor candidate will visit 
the campus two days and one night, 
said John Ulmer, dean of student 
services. 

An ad hoc committee of six senators 
will develop questions to ask chan- 
cellor candidates when they visit 



campus, said Gina Kostoff, Student 
Senate vice president. 

In other business, Senate voted to fill 
a vacancy. Frederiea Lynch recently 
submitted a petition.' "Input from 
various sources is necessary (for a 
good senate), said Lynch, 

In response to a question on how she 
can serve senate, Lynch said, "I feel I 
can best help this group in the 
legislative area." 

Senate approved the application of a 
new studen( organization A group of 
50 students petitioned for recognition 
of a student chapter of the Institute of 
Electronic and Electrical Engineers 
(IEEE). The group is affiliated with a 
professional organization (the IELE) 
which promotes professionalism and 



engineering ethics. 

The new IEEE chapter is interested 
in developing promoting the con- 
struction of a separate electrical 
engineering building in addition to 
providing students with career in- 
formation and the opportunity to in- 
teract with persons already in the 
field. 

Student IEEE chapters also promote 
professionalism and engineering 
ethics, said Willis Mitchell. 

Students interested in IEEE may 
contact the Electrical Engineering 
Department. 

Health Day. a career information 
day, is being sponsored by the Coun- 
seling, Testing and Placement office, 
said Senate Vice President Gina 



Kosloff. Students will have the op- 
portunity to discuss careers in the 
health industry, said Linda Scott of the 
Counseling, Testing and Placement 
office. Included are approximately 30 
employers - area hospitals, social 
service agencies, and nursing homes. 

"The program is not limited to 
senior nursing students," said Scott. 
"AJI majors are urged to attend" 
Employers will be talking to anyone 
who attends but are especially in- 
terested in sociology, mental health 
technology, business, pre-medical and 
psychology, said Scott. 

The Health Day program will be in 
the Walb Ballroom from 10 a.m. to 2

Chief Reporter 

The list of student discounts area 
businesses give to IPFW students is 
here for Ihe remainder of the 
semester. 

The discounts are to area 
restaurants, clothiers, jewelry stores, 
automobile shops and specialty shops 
such as Cheers in Glen brook. 

Gina Kosloff, vice-president of 
Student Senate, said because of the 
late start this year, the duty of con- 
tacting businesses was divided up 
among the senators. In the past, the 
process was done over the summer. 
"We didn't get started on it until 
September," said Kostoff. Due to the 
late start and the magnitude of the job. 
Kostoff said they decided to divide the 
job up among the senators. "Actually, 
it's too big a job for one person to do,"

Change in night classes 
could cause problems 



Thursday, Feb. 27, 1SS6 



Recently, there has been some talk 
concerning one night a week classes on 
campus. Jack Da hi, IPFW registrar, is 
trying to discourage the scheduling of 
these classes to avoid conflicts with 
other evening classes. 

Conflicts? Many students do not feel 
there is a problem of conflicts with one 
night a week classes. These classes are 
usually high in enrollment and in fact 
solve many problems for students. 

When a class meets one night a week, 
it appeals to several kinds of students: 
the student who travels long distances to 
school and chooses a one night a week 
class so that he need only drive into Fort 
Wayne for that one evening; the student 
who works part-time evenings and takes 
a class on his evening off; the student 
who works full-time during the day and 
relies on a different class each night to 
fill degree requirements; and the 
student who simply cannot afford to 
spend more than one evening away from 
his family. 

With so many students taking one 
night a week classes, it would seem that 
by discouraging, and thus eliminating 
most of the scheduling of these classes, 
that very few problems are actually 
solved in comparison to the number of 
problems created. 

Quite simply, one night a week classes 
are almost ideal, for the reasons already 
stated, and for countless more: for 
professors, instructing a one night a 
week class leaves other evenings free for 
family life and preparation for their 
classes The professor of a one night a 
week class needs only prepare once a 
week to teach the class, rather than two, 



three or more times. Also, professors, 
like students, need to come to class only 
one night a week, and they then have the 
next six days during which they can 
complete the grading of exams, 
quizzes, and assignments. Students 
wouldn't have to wait two or more class 
periods to get their results back. 

Clearly, the one night a week classes 
are a vital part of the class schedule, and 
the registrar's office should be working 
to encourage these classes, not 
discourage them. The scheduling of 
classes should be done with one thought 
foremost: the needs of the students — 
not the easiest work for the various 
departments and schools on campus, nor 
the ease of work for the administration. 

It is the university's job to serve the 
students. And as Associate Professor 
Robert Hawley of the department of 
mental health technology said, by 
serving the students, the scheduling of 
classes should be as varied and 
interspersed as the students themselves 
are: IPFW is a commuter campus, so 
the students are generally non- 
traditional. And non-traditional students 
call for non-traditional scheduling of 
classes. 

Students of IPFW have gotten the run 
around quite enough lately, from the 
dragged-out search for a new chancellor 
to the indefinite postponement of the 
proposed fine arts building. Let's not add 
to all this and create more hassles, 
administrators. It's time we all stopped 
worrying about the problems on campus 
and started worrying about the future of 
the students of IPFW.

What really 

delay in our discounts? 



rmispH thP f— Letters to the Editor 

V«aU»3CU LUC Dll , 7ZHZ . 1. D ^ ; .^,c:,_ _. 



It is here! 

No, not Armageddon, as people who 
are soliciting advertisements all over 
campus may think 

But, with only nine weeks of the school 
year left, what finally has arrived is the 
list of student discounts that IPFW 
Student Senate usually provides us with 
as part of the back to school orientation 
.in August. 

■ Listed are the names of several 
community businesses which offer 10, 
15, 20 and 50 percent discounts on their 
goods or services to IPFW students. 

According to Student Senate 
representatives, compiling the discounts 
is a major task. This year, contrary to 
the past, senators divided up the 
responsibilities. Each senator was 
assigned a specific number of businesses 
to contact. 

According to a former Student Senate 
president, the job was not that difficult. 
Although time consuming, he claims to 
have been able to complete in one 
summer month. 

What happened this year, then? 

Perhaps the new senators were never 
properly informed of the process of 
compiling the student discounts. 



Perhaps they were never given a good 
transition into their offices from the 
former officers. 
But who has suffered the most? 
The students have. 
It is no big secret that most college 
students are in dire need of money. They 
cannot afford to be without these 
discounts. 

Apparently, the Student Senatejjid not 
consider that. The present 
administration worked hard to get the 
discounts out, but at the proverbial 
"eleventh hour." 

The former administration did a good 
service by getting the discounts to the 
students in August However, this 
standard practice was slighted by failing 
to complete the list by August. 

It all boils down to communication, or 
more appropriately, failure to 
communicate. There obviously was a 
problem with this last summer. 

Please do not let it happen again. After 
all, your goal should be to serve and 
represent the students. We ask that you 
keep this in mind. 

The Student Senate is presently 
beginning work on next year's discounts. 
This is excellent preparation and we 
applaud your efforts. 



Put talent to work 

To Ihe Editor: 

I read the editorial of Feb. 
13. 1 would like to offer a few 
comments on the subject. 

I agree with you that 
students should have as 
much access as possihle to 
the TV and radio studio 
facilities However, to make 
the argument, as you did, 
that students should be 
granted such access for the 
purpose of making resume 
tapes is ridiculous! Forget 
about resume tapes! 



Radio-TV-Film majors, 
you are intelligent, in- 
dustrious, creative. Put your 
talents to work. Get into the 
studios and create! Get your 
work on Channel 23, Channel 
10, and the local TV stations, 
as the "Young People in 
Broadcasting Club" used to 
do. 

Yes, good quality is im- 
portant. Yes, proper 
maintenance is important. 
But the best equipped 
facility in the world won't 
accomplish anything if you 



don't channel your talent 
and energy into the best 
programming you can 
create. That will be the best 
resume tape you could ask 
for.

Are you ready? 

To the Editor: 

A few minutes ago I was

asking if I would be ready for

however, object strenuously

Home away from home offers quality care for kids 




The Consortium Child 
Care center began its ser- 
vices for the students, 
facully and staff of three 
area institutions Monday. 

The child care center, 
located in Carroll Hall at the 
Fort Wayne State 
Developmental Center, will 
serve IPFW, Indiana 
Vocational Technical School 
and (he Fort Wayne State 
Developmental Center, said 
Jeannie Kauffman, director 
of Consortium Child Care 
The center opens at 7 a.m., 
Monday through Friday. On 
Mondays and Wednesdays, it 
remains open until 7:30 p.m., 



and on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays, it closes at 9 p.m. 

On Fridays, it closes at 5 
p.m. The cost for the service 
is $1.50 per hour, or $45 per 
week for people whose 
children attend the care 
center full-time. Full-time, 
said Kauffman, is con- 
sidered lo be a child who is at 
the center 30 or more hours a 

The center has the 
capability to care for 
children in a number of 
different age groups. The 
first age group is children 
between the ages of six 
months and 15 to IS months. 



Kauffman said children 
remain in this group until 
they are steady walkers. 
This is mainly a safety 
factor, she added. 

The second group is that of 
children between 16 months 
and three years. They have 
two groups of this category, 
commonly called toddlers. 

The third category is 
children in their threes and 
young fours. And finally, the 
fourth category is the older 
four-year-olds and five-year- 
olds. At this stage, said 
Kuaffman. the children 
should be going to kin- 
dergarten the following

year. Therefore, they do a lot 
of readiness work. 

The curriculum for the 
children varies from week to 
week, according to Kauff- 
man. She explained they 
have weekly themes around 
which they design their 
work. For example, this 
week's theme is 

"'dinosaurs," and the 
children have been singing, 
playing games and doing arl 
projects centered around 
(his theme. 

Kauffman also noted the 
children do have free time, 
in which they can ploy or 
draw, do activities of their 
own choice. She said the 
older children, over age 
three, do have a story lime, 
and the toddlers have a nap 
time after lunch. 

Although the center has 
the staff to care for children 
all day long, they do not as 
yet have a food service. 
Kauffman said this is 
because the Fort Wayne 
Stale Developmental Center, 
the site of the center, is 
presently changing to a new 
food service. She said when 
they get that settled, the food 
service will be available to 
the children. 

Kauffman added the 
evening hours are offered on 
demand. Only as long as 
there is an evident need will 
the center provide evening 
care. The same applies to 
weekend care, said Kauf- 
fman. If parents begin to 
express a need for child care 
on the weekends, they will 



try to provide it. 
Children do have to be 

registered in Ihe program. 
However, the center follows 
flexible hours. For instance, 
the center can care for a 
child on Wednesdays and 
Fridays one week, and 
Tuesdays and Thursdays Ihe 
next week. Although they 
can follow the parents' 
schedules this way. the 
children still have to have a 
schedule for a particular 



time frame. They cannot 
accept children on demand, 
said Kauffman. A parent 
cannot walk in one day, 
without having registered, 
without having a schedule 
set with the center and 
request child care. 

Kauffman said the center 
also has to follow state limits 
on Ihe. teacher to pupil ratio 
and the space ratios to 
prevent them from 
becoming loo cramped. 




Voices Across IPFW/If the registrar eliminates one-night-a-week 

classes, how would it affect you? 




RON REYNOLDS

"Changing the one nighl a

thai all of my classes are 
scheduled in the day, and I 
keep my nights open to be

"One night a week classes 

would not affect me, but I 
feel that they should keep it

MIKE MILLER

"The change to one night a 
week classes would not 
affect me. But it would 
probably be a hardship to 
those students pursuing a 
degree while at the same 
time working and com- 
muting a long way from 
home." 



ANDY FINDER 
Sophomore 

Business 
"The burden is that this is 
a commuter campus and 
that means more driving will 
be involved. Since I do take 
some night classes, this 
would have a direct effect on 
me." 



L1NC MITCHELL 
Junior 
Pre -Optometry 
"The registrar must keep 
in mind that this is a com- 
muter campus. Many people 
drive in from long distances. 
There are also many people 
who work full-time and have 
to leave their families in 
order to finish their 
education. It would be much 
easier for these people if 
they only had to be burdened 
onceaweek." 



LISAKONGER 

Sophomore 

Audi lory-Speech Pathology 

"To eliminate the night 
classes all together would 
make it impossible for the 
people who work to fulfill 
their classes that they need. 
However, I don't see any 
reason why they can't make 
the classes one or two days 
out of the week instead of 
three "

IPFW students 
form troupe 

By JAMES E. GARCIA 
Staff Writer 

Meet The Company, IPFW's newest campus organization 
which plans to inject a dose of creativity into the scene. 

At center stage, Ashton Humphrey, president of the club. 
He views the formation of the club as a useful tool for 
achieving objectives that can benefit the campus and Fort 
Wayne. 

Through various fundraising events, ranging from car 
washes to summer stock theater. The Company hopes to 
raise money for a new PIT sound system. 

Humphrey and his troupe of recently elected club officers 
also see The Company as a needed means for allowing 
anyone who has ever wanted to express their creativity 
through theuter, an opportunity to do so. 

Membership in The Company is open to anyone, students 
and non-students alike. 

If you aren't interested in acting, there are many aspects 
to theatre in which to become involved. Costume makers, set 
designers, stage hands and other interested persons are 
welcome to join in this endeavor. 

Officers for the club include Humphrey as president; 
Donnette Blanks, vice-president; Carlo Garcia, treasurer; 
Jerome Grant, secretary; and Joel Murray, who will serve 
as creative advisor. 

The Company plans to travel to Stratford, Ontario for the 
annual Shakespeare festival. 

Masque, a bi-weekly newsletter, will be published to in- 
form readers of upcoming club activities, and general 
theater information, as well as provide periodic articles on 
theater. 

Future plans for The Company include the production of a 
weekly soap opera to be aired on a local public access 
station. The development of an improvisation troupe is being 
considered, for the purpose of helping actors to hone their 
skills and share advice on technique or style. 

The proposed troupe eventually plans to stage public 
performances in and around the Fort Wayne area. 

Weekly meetings will be held on Mondays at noon in PlT, 
room G30. in iheKeUler^uilding. '

Staff Writer 

Ever wonder how the National Horse Thief Detective 
Association began' 1 Who the first Hoosier selected "Most 
Valuable Player" in the NBA was ? Answers to these 
questions and a host of others can be discovered in the new 
book that tells little known facts about the Hoosier land 
around us. 

"The Indiana Book of Records, Firsts, and Fascinating 
Facts" is the title of a recent release from Indiana 
University Press. The work is a compilation by Fred D. 
Cavinder. editor of the Indianapolis Star Magazine and an 
alumnus of Indiana University. 

"It's all kinds of trivia and facts," stated Rose Mcllveen, 
who works for the Indiana University News Bureau. 

The book contains every kind of trivia imaginable, dating 
back to the early IBOO's. Items such as the first theatrical 
production in Indiana and the first sports stars in the state 
are described in the publication. 

"It's got a large sports section," Mcllveen replied, 
referring to the hundreds of Indiana sports history facts that 
take well over 100 pages of the book. 

One of those facts concerns Oscar Robinson. A one-time 
student at Crispus Attucks High School in Indianapolis, 
Robinson was the first Hoosier to enter professional 



basketball, scoring a lifetime total of 25,000 points. This is. 
just one of the many facts and trivia bits on sports included 



Mcllveen described the complexity of the book, "(The 
book) is divided up into sections by subjects," she slated, one 
of which is disasters. This is explained with news in- 
formation about tornados and other natural disasters. The 
other sections cover incredible sports facts, accidents in-' 
volving automobiles, and information on the successful- 
accomplishments of women over the years. 

"Gathering records about Hoosiers is something like- 
evaluating the work of Penelope, who wove and unraveled ' 
fabric while awaiting the return of Ulysses; Ihere is no' 
telling when the job is readily done," said Cavinder about his 
Indiana collection. "A reader of Indiana publications once"" 
noted that journalists claim as a Hoosier anvone who flevf' 1 
over the slate in an aircraft." 

This book is a trivia buffs delight. Loaded with all kinds of ' 
reminders of the past, it can be obtained at most area books' 
stores. It can also be ordered directly from the Indiana* 
University Press at 10th and Morton streets, Bloomington,'- 
IN 47405. The cost is S12.50. It's a great way to put some 
excitement into an otherwise ordinary day by finding out-' 
more about Indiana. 



Van Ort breathes life into play 



Review 



ByM. KATHLEEN 

GREVEN 

Features Editor 

Our own Denise Benson 

Van Ort, PIT veteran, stole 

the show her first time on the 

CivicTheatrestage. 

Summer and Smoke, 'by 
Tennessee Williams, acted 
as the get-away vehicle. Her 
leading role as Alma 
Winemiller is the typical 
Williams heroine — a weak 
and nervous woman. 

Van Ort quivered, shook, 
stammered and gesticulated 
her way through this very 
convincing portrayal of a 
minister's daughter in a 
small Mississippi town. Next 
to the depth she brought to 
Alma, other characters in 
the play had little more 
substance than moveable 
cardboard props. 

It's too bad that Dr. John 
Buchanan, Sr,, played by 
Robert E. Behr, wasn't 
larger — he was great as the 



small town doctor who all 
but held Alma's hand until 
her "heart palpatations" 
ended. His son. who lusted 
after Alma for a good part of 
the play, wavered between 
being surly and cocky, 
resulting in a rather uneven 
performance by Ed Koc- 
zergo. 

The biggest disap- 
pointment of all was the 
portrayal of Rosa Gonzales. 
This character could have 
been sexy or very romantic 
or exotic, but instead was 
very childlike. 

Her whining demeanor left 
us to winder if Rosa is a 
teenage nymphet or a full 
grown woman capable of 
capturing John, Jr.'s at- 
tention. Hopefully, Kimm 
Rachelle Covault will be 
given more reign In the 
portrayal or the age of the 
character will be more well 
defined. 

True to the history of the 
Civic Theatre, the sets and 
costumes were high in 
quality and lent an aura of 
Victorian style to the 
otherwise sparse audi- 
torium.

Mastodons, Lady 'Dons sparkle in s eason's final home stand 

Reed, Ivy, Morlan, lead men 



ByTONYDUNAWAY 

SUff Writer 

The IPFW men's 

basketball team broke a five- 
game losing streak last week 
as the Mastodons en- 
tertained two of the top three 
teams in [he Great Lakes 
Valley Conference 

Thursday, Coach Tim 
Russell's team kept alive 
their dominance over 
Southern Indiana with a 64-61 
win over the Evansville- 
based school. IPFW has only 
dropped one game to the 
Eagles in six meetings. 

Three players placed the 
'Dons in the scoring 
department with Scott Reed, 



Richard Ivy and Jim Morlan 
all netting 16 points. Morlan 
hit all seven of his shots from 
the field and both of his free 
throws, in addition to pulling 
down a game-high 15 
rebounds. 

Morlan's two free throws 
with 40 seconds remaining 
proved to be the difference in 
the contest, 

Saturday's game against 
Kentucky Wesleyan was just 
as close, but the Panthers 
came up with a clutch basket 
and a free throw at the end to 
claima61-S8 victory. 

Wesleyan had given 
the 'Dons their worst loss of 
the season back in January, 



winning 95-63 in Owensboro. 
But it was IPFW who held 
the lead this lime, running 
up a 10-point advantage in 
the first half before leading 
30-27 at intermission. 

A basket by the Panthers' 
Stanley Jackson with 1:21 
left tied the game at 58-58. 
Neither team could manage 
a basket in the following 
minute until Wesleyan's 
Dave Bennett ripped the net 
from deep in the corner to 
give KWC a 60-58 lead with 15 
seconds left 

IPFW's Lawrence Jordan 
brought the ball up court and 
passed off to Scott Reed, who 
drove the baseline and was 



called for traveling after 
being bumped by a Wesleyan 
player, with three seconds 
remaining. 

Jordan and Bruce Erwin 
each scored 12 for IPFW, 
while Richard. Ivy and 
Morlan contributed 10 each. 
Morlan was again perfect 
from the field, hitting all five 
of his shots and turning his 
consecutive field goals to 13 
straight over the past three 

The men conclude their 
season tonight and Saturday 
at Lewis University and St. 
Joseph's College. They have 
an 8-18 overall mark and a 3- 
11 GLVC record

Miller and Bev Miller added 
10 each. The Lady 'Dons led 
40-29 at the half after con- 
necting on 17 of 30 first half 
attempts. 

It was much the same 
story Saturday as IPFW led 
by 11 points midway through 
the final half, before Ken- 



tucky Wesleyan stormed 
back to just fall short. 
Seniors Clara Trowbridge 
and Rita Boyle, both playing 
in their final home game, 
had big parts in (he victory. 
Trowbridge hit seven of her 
first eight shots before 
finishing with a team-high 22 
points, while Boyle was on 
target with nine assists. 

Lydy added 15 points and

Cardinals rally, beat Volleydons 




By CINA JONES 
Staff Writer 

Ball State dropped the 
Hth-ranked Volleydons in a 
jam-packed game here at 
LPFW Friday night. The 
Volleydons got an early lead, 
up by two games, only to lose 
the last three of the match. 
The crowd attendance for 
the volleyball match was 
over 1 100. 

In game one, Ball Stale got 
an early 0-4 lead before the 
Volleydons could really back 
and place themselves on the 
board. The game was a 
game of ties. The CardinaJs 
and the Volleydons were tied 
4-4, 6-6, 7-7. 8-8. The Car- 
ls look a short-lived lead 
after_ that to accomplish a 



score of 9-12, only for the 
Volleydons to come back and 
take the game in six straight 
points, winning the game 15- 
12. 

In the second game of Ihe 
night, the Volleydons again 
fell behind early, but quickly 
closed the gap at a 5-S tie. A 
serve by Jay Golds teyn gave 
the Volleydons their first 
lead of game two. 6-5. Bail 
State was able to fight their 
way to an even 8-8 score, but 
the Volleydons went on to 
steal the game, 15-8. 

The third game found the 
Volleydons still in Ihe run- 
ning. The men were leading 
2-0 overall. But, as luck has 
it, the game did not go ac- 
cording to plan. The Car- 



dinals dropped the 
Volleydons, 13-1S. 

The game was close the 
whole way through Loren 
Gebert gave the Volleydons 
their first lead of the game, 
making the score 4-3. The 
Volleydons then fought their 
way from behind, (o take a 
11-9 lead late in the game. 
Ball State got their second 
wind, and eventually won the 
game, 13-15. 

Game four of the match 
began with the Volleydons 
taking a 1-0 lead, 3-2 lead, 
then a 5-3 lead, only to fall to 
Ihe score of 5-14. IPFW 
received their final point in

IPFW to finish on the road 




Saturday the IPFW Mens' 
and Womens' Basketball 
Teams finished their home 
schedules. IPFW goes on the 
road, with the remaining 
games to Lewis University 
in Illinois and to Ashland 
College in Ashland, Ohio. 

Last week's games were 



the last chance for many of 
us to see the men's and 
women's learns perform at 
home. 

So, if you did not get a 
chance to see either team 
play this season, here are a 
few pictures and descrip- 
tions of what you missed.

When Scott Reed, a junior 
college transfer, appeared 
on the scene at IPFW last 
fall, he brought with him 
many impressive creden- 
tials. 

Reed, a Terre Haute South 
Vigo High School graduate 
and basketball MVP, at- 
tended Lakeland Com- 
munity College tn Mat toon. 
Illinois, where he averaged 
14 points and nine assists a 
gamelast season. 

Reed says he feels good 
playing for IPFW coach Tim 
Russell. "It took awhile, but 
I'm getting used to Coach 
Russell's style," Reed said. 
"He has a lot of knowledge 
about basketball and he is 
trying his best to pass some 
of that knowledge on to us. 
At the beginning ol the year 
we were playing for our- 
selves, but we've started to

get it together and now we 
are playing as a team." 

Reed, a supervision 
major, would like to coach 
basketball someday, maybe 
at the college level. Another 
ambition Reed has is for the 



Mastodons to win the GLVC 
championship next year and 
receive an NCAA bid. 

Coach Russell feels Reed 
has come a long way too. 
"Scott has learned that there 
is a requirement for much 
more commitment to the 
mental side of the game at 
this level," stated Coach 
Russell "When he came 
here there was no doubt he 
knew what to do when he had 
theballinhishands.butnow 
he is learning how to play 
without the ball. Overall. I'm 
pleased with Scott, but there 
is more for him lo learn He 
cares a lot about' the game 
and that is a big asset in his 
favor." 

The tact (hat Reed is 
learning to adjust is evident 
in his climbing statistics; he 
is averaging 9.4 points and 
two steals per game and 
heads the learn in foul 
shooting at 7B percent.
