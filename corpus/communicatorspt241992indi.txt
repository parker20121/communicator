Fort offers 'good faith' price reductions 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

Ttic Fort, in a good-faith effort 
10 appease the students, rcduccO 
the prices of several menu items, 
said Paul Strouis. director of 
purchasing. 

Last Tuesday The Fort man- 
agement met with Strouts lo dis- 
cuss price increases. The Fort is 
required, through their contract 
with IPFW. to check with Strouis 
before they can increase prices. 

Sirouls said he denied The Fort 
the price changes, but Canteen 
raised rates anyway. 

The controversy that arose 
because of the increase led The 
Fon to offer two cost reductions. 
Coffee will be 50 cents, five 
cents less than last year. Large 
drinks will drop from 75 cents to 
70. 



Because the price hike was not 
cleared through the univeristy. 
Canteen Company was in viola- 
lion of their contract at The Fori. 

According to Strouts,Thc Fori 
simply 




Paul Strouts approval. 

"The timing of the increases 
came at a bad lime and they just 
didn't follow through with what 
they had lo do," Strouts conclud- 
ed. 

Since the meeting Strouts said 
he determined that the increases 
are "reasonable and justified." 

In comparison with competi- 



tors like Hall's and Charky's, 
Strouts determined thai The Fort 
is "right in line with what they 
charge." 

Strouts added The Fort is con- 
sistently within a dime of com- 
petitor's rates. 

Another justification for higher 
food costs includes The Fort's 
rising operational fees. 

Product costs rose 10 percent 
with individual foods rising from 
two to 24 percent. Hamburger 
costs went up 13 percent. 
Lettuce jumped 72 percent. 
Fountain pop went up 18 per- 
cent, and cookies skyrocketed 9 
percent. 

The Fort reported a 3 percent 
salary increase with larger health 
benefit expenses. 

"These were substantial 
increases and we need to support 



diosc increases to keep The Fort 
as a viable operation." said 
Strouts. 

With Canteen netting only a 
one percent return on sales, or 



"We are pleased with 
The Fort's willingness lo 
offer reductions in 2 
areas. This shows their 
good faith in the stu- 
dents." 
•Paul Strouts 

about S2,900 annually, Strouts 
said it was time for prices to be 
raised, 

"So far they have done a good 
job at maintaining their costs, 
and the students have supported 



them," Suouts added. He esti- 
mated that the price hike and 
student suppon will equate to a 
stronger food service. 

The current food costs will 
stand for a while. Suouts said, 
and he docs not anticipate any 
further increases this year. 

"We are pleased with The 
Fort's willingness to offer reduc- 
tions in 2 areas. This shows 
their good faith in the students," 
Strouts continued. 

Without the support of the stu- 
dents, Strouts said the long-term 
financial hcollh of the institution 
might be in Jeopardy. 

"We'd be hard pressed to find 
another company to come in and 
take these chances," added 
Strouts, He said the risk of hav- 
ing no cafeiena is not oul of the 
question. 



University unlocks funds 
for student government 



Discount package coming 

By J. William Richardson ly for the 
Copy Editor 

Unfreezing the IPSGA fund- 
ing was a top priority for ihe 
new year, according to Scemab 
Rashccd. vice-president of 
finance. 

The funds, which were frozen 
in a contingency fund due to an 
error in Ihe budgeting procc 



dure, are used campuswide for ijic situation. 



ivcrsighi rested wiih 
last year's student administra- 
tion. 

"We spent our time this year 
trying to undo the things that 
were done at that time," said 
Rashecd. 

Rajat Sun. IPSGA president, 

was pleased with die outcome 

'ith Rasheed's handling of 



various student activities. 

IPSGA's funds were unfrozen 
last week, after ihe error in pro- 
cedure was corrected by the 
senate budget commiiice 
chaired by Rashecd. 

"The budget is supposed to be 
allocated to organizations by an 
appointed committee," said 
Rashced. "and last year it 
wasn't. They froze our 
accounis." 

According to Rasheed, this 
oversight resulted in the 
IPSGA's funds being frozen by 
Frank Borelli, vice chancellor 
of student affairs. 

"Hearings arc supposed to be 
convened in order to lei organi- 
zations explain and defend their 
budget requests." said Borelli. 
'The senate did not hold these 
meetings." 

"As you can imagine, organi- 
zations thai had their funding 
cut or denied complained lo me 
and to the chancellor," said 
Borelli. 'The senate violated its 
own procedures." 

"Last May I met with the out- 
going and incoming student 
government administralions and 
we decided to handle it by re- 
opening the budget early in the 
fall semester and addressing the 
concerns of those groups whose 
funds were cut or denied," said 
Borelli, 

According to Borelli, these 
meetings were convened and 
completed and he unfroze the 
IPSGA contingency fund, 
where the funds in question 
were held in the interim period. 

Rashccd said that responsibili- 



"I'm very pleased with 
Scemab's handling of this diffi- 
cult situation," said Suri. 

In other senate news, space is 
being re-allocated in the student 
organizations room on the sec- 
ond floor of Walb Memorial 
Union. 

"We're reorganizing the 
offices up there in order to fil 
some new organizations in who 
had bc«n promised space," said 
Chris Douse, a student senator 
and the chair of the campus 
organization commiuee, 

"We have some new fraterni- 
ties and sororities coming to 
campus," said Douse, "so we 
need to re-allocate our space." 

The student discount package 
is ready for printing and should 
be available later this semester, 
according to Elbert Webster, 
IPSGA's vice-president of legis- 
lation. 

"Now we are looking for a 
way to keep former students 
from using their ID's to get dis- 
counts intended for cunent stu- 
dents." said Webster. "We are 
hoping to use a stamp of some 
kind on the back of the ID (stu- 
dent services card) lo prevent 
fraud." 

"It's really not fair for these 
businesses to have to give a dis- 
count to everyone who's ever 
attended IPFW," said Webster, 
"We don't want them lo go out 
of business." 

The student affairs commiuee 
is currcndy addressing ihe con- 
cerns of motorcycle riders on 
the IPFW.

Drunk drivers snagged on campus 



By J. William Richardson 
Copy Editor 

Increased traffic on IPFW's 
streets last week resulted in 
headaches for the campus police, 
according to Chief Lauren 
DcnHartog of the department of 
police and safety. 

The traffic ovcrdow resulted in 
a trio of drunk driving arrests. 
Early morning anesis for operat- 
ing while intoxicated sent one 
motorist to the city county lock- 
up on each day last Wednesday, 
Thursday and Friday mornings. 

"This is the biggest week I've 
seen," said DcnHartog. "We had 
a lot of problems with traffic. 
Last week was a bad week for 
everybody." 

With the reopening of Crescent 
Avenue, Dentianog said campus 
traffic should return to normal, 



but is cautious nonetheless. 

"Construction is still continu- 
ing on some of the sunounding 
streets," said the Chief. "So nor- 
mal is any- 
body's 




violation," said DcnHartog, 
"Parking is really straightening 

OUL" 

DcnHartog said the depaitmeni 
is currently planning Safety 
Awareness Week, scheduled for 
Oct. 11 through Oct. 17, 

Working in conjunction with 



Students' Government, the 
Womcns' Studies Center and 
other campus organizations, the 
dcpanment is planning a number 
of activities. 

According to DcnHartog, ten- 
laiivcly scheduled events include 
CPR lectures, a presentation by 
the Fort Wayne police crime pre- 
vention unit, a trauma center 
helicopter landing and molorey- 
clc safety instfucuon, 

"The crime prevention unit 
will present safety tips and infor- 
mation regarding locks," said 
DenHarlog. 

According to the Chief, a hog 
roast for safety week in conjunc- 
tion with the students' govern- 
ment is cunently in the works, 
but is still in the early planning 
stages. 



Trustees approve funding 
for new science building 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

If Ihe Indiana state legislature 
approves, IPFW may have a 
new science building. 

Both Purdue at West 
Lafayette and Indiana 
University at Bloomington 
have approved the request for 
the new Building, according to 
Don Katter, director of the 
physical planL 

"We haven't received funding 
yet, but our request has been 
approved by our two mother 
institutions," said Katter. 

Purdue university trustees 
will include in the 1993-94 
budget proposals money for Ihe 
new IPFW building. 



The new building would take 
over many of the science class- 
es now held in Ketiler Hall. 

The space in Ketiler would 
then be changed to computer 
teaching labs for some of the 
other disciplines, according to 
Jack Dahl, registrar and vice 
chancellor for planning. 

"Now we have lo wait for the 
legislature to vote on the pro- 
posal. If it is approved, IPFW 
can sell bonds which will be 
repaid over ihe next thirty 
years or so," said Katter. 

If the building is approved. 
IPFW officials expect the 
building to be erected by 1996.

Head for the polls, 
cast a responsible vote 



In 1960, the presideniial election pilling 
John F. Kennedy versus Richard Nixon 
was decided by such a small margin thai 
one vole in each precinct in America could 
have changed ihc course of hisiory. 

There is a behef among many in America 
and among us ai IPFW ihai one voic can- 
not change an election or decide a presi- 
dential race. Actually, the opposite it true. 

In fact, one vole is the only way to 
choose a chief executive. One voic cast by 
each conscientious voter is the basis of our 
federal republic. 

On election day. will your vole change 
the course of hislory? The pollsters and 
politicians say thai it probably won't. Your 
vote will not be the one tliai chooses the 
course of history. Your one vole for George 
Bush will not give him four more years. 
Your one vote for Bill Clinton will not give 
him a chance to change these united stales. 

Why won't your vote be this deciding 
factor? Because you probably won't cast ii. 
Take responsibilily. 

Each election year the percentage of col- 
lege students voting falls. Less and less 
young people lake advantage of ihe most 
convenient vehicle for change in hisiory. 
ihc American electoral system. Fewer and 
fewer students take ihe time lo change our 
nation and our future for the belter. 

hidiana's voter registration ends Oci. 10. 
Registering now may be the only chance 
you really have to shape Ihe future. 

Bui voting is not your only responsibility. 
Random votes along party lines for ill&lt;on- 
scienccd. slick politicians are as dangerous 
as not voting alall. 

It is your responsibility to shape the 
fulure wisely and to follow your own 
knowledge and conscience.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 



"Mark Snyder" 

At Indiana Purdue Fort Wayne 

Lives one who loves to complain 

His bite is not up to his biu^k 

His title is ex-president Mark 

He wants you to think he is alone 

(Well maybe him and Oliver Stone) 

In the good fight to protect you and me 

From big government and conspiracy 

He suspects IPSGA of some nefarious plot 

The police, the bookstore, I almost forgot 

The secret cabal of students and staff 

When I think about that I begin to laugh 

It doesn't take brains or any insight 

lb see IPSGA can't do anything right 

The only conspiracy they could orchestrate 

Could be broken up by a child of eight 

But we're not discussing IPFW's Haws 

We were talking about a fat Santa Ciaus 

Whose acts were so asinine 

That he was compelled to resign 

Before the senate kicked him 

out on his duff 

But for our resident rebel it wasn't enough 

His ongoing saga can be read 

on these pages 

He searches really hard for offbeat outrages 

I'm sure someday we'll see one 

about not enough snacks 

Or the student/vending machine ratio 

being out of whack 

So when the Communicator 

prints his next letter 

I've thought of somediing to 

make it much belter 

Get scissors, cut it out, and save it for later 

I'm sure it would make 

mighty fine toilet paper.

IPFW Student 



His public responds 
Snyder, will you retire? 



Id the Editor: 

Oh boy, here we go again, 
another year of Mark Snyder 
whining and complaining 
jbout nothing. 

Firsi off, Mark, did it ever 
occur 10 you ihai those of you 
who insist on ruining your 
lungs wilh the intake of car- 
cinogenic compounds arc in 
the minority? I believe thai 
the law in the United States, 
has been, for years, majority 
rule. As far as Tm concerned 1 
don't want your filihy habits 
ruining my lungs in the 
future. I live wilh a smoker 
jnd have seen first hand what 
imoking will do to a person. 

Secondly, what arc you 
doing parking in a metered 
parking loi? In case you didn't 
see Ihe sign, those are 
reserved for visitors. Do you 
call your daily class schedule 
a visitation? Besides. I have 
yet to sec a parking problem. 
just because you refuse to get 
off your la/.y butt and walk 
from the outer parking to 
your class does not constitute 
a parking problem. The way 
you look you could use all the 
cercise you could get. Most 
people on this campus arc loo 
lazy to walk from those other 
parking lots. Don't complain 
Jbout parking if you're not 
yoing to use what's there. 
And about parking fines, if 
yuu obey the rules, you don'l 
gel fined. The only people 
thai I sec complaining about 
parking fmcs arc the ones that 
continually disobey the rules. 
Serves you right to get fined 
if you're going lo pork where 
&gt;ou'fe not supposed to. 

And ah yes, students' gov- 
emmeni. That infamous body 
of no good lazy bums that 
[rics to find ihe worst and 
most idiotic way of spending 



our money. As far as the con- 
dom issue is concerned if 
people on this campus want 
to screw around lei them buy 
their own condoms don'l 
spend my money supplying 
them. As far as members are 
concerned, did you ever slop 
10 think about why people 
actually don't run for office. 
Outside of Ihe fact that no 
one wants to be associated 
with an organization of such 
ill repute, did you ever con- 
sider [he fact of why people 
arc here in ihc first place? 
Heaven forbid il actually be 

"Do you call your daily 
class schedule a visila- 
tioti?"

for learning and getting an 
education. Most students that 
1 know don'l have the lime to 
be associated wilh student 
government, I know 1 don'l. 
Bui. hey. that's what students' 
government is for right? To 
lei la/y slobs like you who 
only lake one or two classes 
at a lime sit back and blow 
political cliches at each other. 
About your presentation to 
Uic trustee's, why should they 
listen lo a middle aged goof- 
ball wearing long hair and 
jeans?. I wouldn't . Well 
enough about thai, on to bet- 
ter things. 

As far as I'm concerned ihc 
lesson 10 be learned from 
your letter is that when il 
comes to whining, big 
mouthed, radical trouble- 
makers, you take Ihe cake. 
And in the fuiurc 1 suggest 
thai you follow your original 
course of action and retire ihc 
pen, we're tired of reading

Last year, a new Code of Sludcni 
Rights, Responsibilities, and Con- 
duct was submitted to both Indiana 
and Purdue Universities for 
approval. and implementation at 
IPFW. This document was the result 
of over one year's work in drafting 
by students, faculty, administration 
and staff at this campus. It was read- 
ily and unanimously endorsed by the 
Fort Wayne Faculty Senate as well 
as iheStudent Government Associa- 
tion. 

While it conformed to a similar 
code provided Indiana University 
students it was rejected by Purdue's 
President Steven Bcering and the 
Purdue Board of Trustees and 
returned in a revised form in which 
sejiual orientation was removed as a 
protected status. 

This bastardized student code was 
accepted by the administration at 
fPFW but rejccied by both the Fori 
Wayne Faculty Senate and the Stu- 
dent Government Association. In a 
unanimous vote, both of the afore- 
mentioned governing bodies on this 
campus withdrew their endorsement 
from this student code. Nonetheless. 
Ihis homophobic student code has 
been placed into effect, illegitimate- 
ly, by the administration at this cam- 
pus. 

The only regulations governing 
students' rights, conduct, and 
responsibilities other than those 
backed by sUiie and federal statute 
arc contained in this student code. I, 
and other members of this academic 
community — faculty and students 
alike — question whether or not this 
code can be enforced with the lack 
of endorsement from the faculty and 
student governing bodies, ll would 
appear that, at the present time, the 
University has no legal means to 
enforce campus policy as the means

The wailing period would also give 
lime 10 panicked citizens to think 
about whether or not they wish to 
have a gun. If my house had just

By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

He is siHing on ihc bed, wearing 
only yellow bikini bfiefs and ankle 
high leather buckle boots. His 
uncombed hair is matted and poofed 
a foot high. Russ Reklaw is smok- 
ing, 

"Arc you from Renl-A-Ccntcr?" 
he barks. "I mailed the damn pay- 
ment this morning!" 

I icll him who I am, I icll him I set 
up this appointment to interview 
him for a Leisure story. The Com- 
municator, 1 remind Reklaw. is the

And he's silting on the bed in his 
room above the Fort Wayne Social 
Hygiene Clinic, There's a chrome 
plated 9 millimeter pistol on the 
stand next lo his bed. There's a bot- 
tle of Wild Turkey in his hand. He 
lakes a drink. "Well," he groans. 
"What the hell do you want?" 

I clear some Penguin Point bags 
off of a green plaid Lay-Z-Boy 
recliner in the comer and sit down. I 
cross my legs, leaving my knee 
sticking up high enough to block my 
view of Reklaw's lower body. Then 
I stancd the interview. 

So this is where you live. Have 
you always lived in Fort Wayne? 

R.R. - "I was bom in Gary. In a 
bus. I got off in Fort Wayne. I've 
been here since." 

Do you like it here? You must 
since you've been here so long. 

R.R. ■ "Sure, I like the Fon fine, I 
got everything here 1 need. I got 
Showgirl's to go lo for entertain- 
ment. And if I get bored I'll go over 
to Brandy's. But most of the time I 
sit in here and watch Channel 55. 
Some of those shows are so damn 
funny when you're toasted." 



clear as I sec yours. And sometimes 
I play the horses. 

Isn't that sort of unethical? 

R. R. - "Hah, Hah. You can take 
your ethics and cram 'em up your 
ass buddy." 

No offense, but if you make so 
much money, why live like this? 

R. R. - "I'm into the rotten essence 
of urban decay. And I can walk to 
nine strip bars from here." 

Well, since you're a psychic and 
all, how about a few predictions? 

R. R. - "That lilde Nazi shit Perot 
is going to be the next president. 
The Pirates are going to win the 
series in seven. You are going lose a

going to be ravaged by sulphur fires 
and flocks of huge, flesh-eating 
insects." 

When?

New Macintosh computers 
meet student demands 



By Mary Shrock 
Features Editor 

IPFW has recently added iwo new 
compulcr labs and upgraded an old 
one. 

For studcnls who weren't aware of 
it, there are computer labs in Kcttlcr, 
Neff, Walb and ihe library. Anyone 
who attends IPFW has access to the 
computers, all you need is a fomiaicd 
disk. 

Mark Frankc, manager of User 
Services said, "Student demand for 
computers is rising rapidly. Money 
needs to be spent on supporting aca- 
demic use of computers. We've dou- 
bled the number oi^ personal computers 
and we're running oui of room." 

Greg Applegate. training coordinator 
for the computer science department 
said funding and space were the two 
biggest problems right now. 

"The worst thing we have is a lack 
of money and lack of space," 
Applegate said. 

Another available option are termi- 
nal clusters of Va\ mainframes for 
faculty and limited student use. Tliesc 
arc located on the second floor of 
Ketiler. 

According to Dr. Bill Baden, Van 
systems manager, Vax computers 
allow students and faculty a wide vari- 



ety of research options, 

"Vax has statistical packages, lan- 
guage compilers, and instructional 
; for faculty research." Baden 



Bfldcn added that students in busi- 
ness, computer science and engineer- 
ing most frequently use the system. 

Baden also noted another capaciiy 
that the computers are programmed lo 
carry; football scores. 

"If you want to know the football 
schedule at Ohio State you could find 
out on the Vax," Baden said. 

A new service technician was recent- 
ly hired for Ihc department which 
houses its own hardware dcpartmcm, 
so thai computers can be fixed in- 
house, according to Applegate. 

Applegate said that more student 
consultanB were also hired this year to 
accommodate growing student 
demands. 

"More student consultants are avail- 
able now and they're being trained 
better, so that we can meet student 
necdi," Applegate said. 

Sean Justice, a student consuliani 
said. "We help students who have 
problems, either with programming or 
with classes. We have to have two 
consultants on duty now, because with 
just one we can'i handle it"

ping, it's got a building with 
eight — yes, boys, eight — floors of 
sporting goods. 

Who could beat that? 

Not that Fon Wayne ain't got it 
all, but if you feel a need to flee 
(he Summit city, Chicago is the 
place to be. 

For sports buffs there's the cub- 



bies, the bears, the black hawks 
and the bulls. But remember to 
purchase tickets in advance — 
these games sell out quickly. 

Second City Improvisation Club 
should be a must on your night- 
ume excursions list. It costs noili- 
ing lo gel in and there are usually 
two shows each evening at eight 
and eleven. 

The Art Insiilute of Chicago is a 
great place for cullural-minded 
studcnls lo spend a leisurely day 
with arls greatest masterpieces. 

Don't forget concerts. 

Chicago boasts some of the best 
artists series and concert lineups 
in the nation, ranking just behind 
L.A. and New York. Any ticket- 
master outlet will give you a list 
of concerts in that area. 

So, as long as the Windy city's 
icmpermental climate remains 
above freezing, it's a great way to 
spend a lazy, Sunday afternoon.

Professor has own theory 
on modem day dinosaurs 



Friends don't let

drunk! 



By Mary Shrock 
Features Editor 

Jim Farlow. professor of oceanog- 
raphy, says all you have to do is 
look to the sky if you want to sec 
the descendants of dinosaurs. 

"Birds are probably the closest liv- 
ing relative of ihe dinosaur. Their 
skull features and limbs are very 
similar," said Farlow, 

Farlow 
says that his 
main area of 
interest is 
interpreting 
fossilized 
dinosaur 
fooiprinis.

cal." said 
Farlow. 
Currently Farlow is working on 
publishing a theory he has about 
why meat-eating dinosaurs were so 



much bigger than modem day meat 
eating mammals, such as lions and 
bears. 

One of the past projccu Farlow 
worked on was studying the food 
habits of deep water fish, but Farlow 
says he has been fascinated with 
dinosaurs from a very early age. 

"Around the age of six I discov- 
ered I liked dinosaurs and I've been 
studying them ever since," Farlow 
said. 

One activity that Farlow admits 
has been a lifelong hobby is playing 
with his collection of trains. 

"I was interested with trains 
before I liked dinosaurs," Farlow 



said.

IPFW lacks common goal 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Has it ever occurred to anyone else 
ihai ihc IPFW spons program may 
have on identity crisis? 

Individually, the teams (hai com- 
prise this coalition appear well- 
adjusted. 

The men's volleyball learn plays 
compcLtivcly on the national level, 
garnishing wcll-dcscrvcd media 
attention. 

Men's basketball, women's bas- 
ketball, and women's volleyball 
consistently finish near the top of 
the Great Lakes Volley Conference, 
if not in ihc topspoL 

All-Amcrican status has been 

IPFW Sports 
Spotligtit 

bestowed on several IPFW aiJileics, 
and others have been candidates for 
this honor. 

Men's baseball has also seen a 
boost in their image with the 
appointment of Mau Kinzer as head 
coach. Kinzcr has played profes- 
sional baseball in the past and brings 
his leadership to diis posL 

However, regardless of the many 
elements of spons excellence I can 
pinpoint, the fact still remains that 
the IPFW sports program exists like 
splintered pieces of a great oak tree 
destroyed by liEhUiing strikes. 

Assisting the demise of the oak 
was the aiicmpis of pseudo-tree sur- 
geons forcing the evolution from a 
sapling to a thick oak, and only 
weakening the trunk through dis- 



In the beginning, ihc sapling pro- 
duced a crimson and gold foliage, 
exhibiting trails of its strong onion 
of splicing from Indiana and Purdue. 
This early Masiadon, as it became 
known, grew quickly on its own. 

As branches grew other names 
were added such as Lady 'Dons and 
'Dons. 

Then the big changes came. A 
very powerful, thick branch sprout- 
ed, rivaling the trunk itself and was 
called Volleydons. The name spread 
like wildfire and circulated in the 
media. 

A disease swept over the oak 
recently turning the foliage blue and 
white, and a cure has not been dis- 
covered. 

These are the historical facts that 
have been discovered, but even the 
location has caused some outsiders 
to inject their brand of poison, and 
weaken the union of teams. 

Are we at Indiana University- 
Purdue Univeristy at Fort Wayne, 
lUPU, IPFW, Bypass High, etc.? 
Do we compete in the Multi- 
purpose Building, Athletic Center, 
of Hillard Gates Spons Center? 

As it stands, these co-existing and 
yet estranged teams will have to 
band together in pursuit of die dis- 
covery of their common heritage, 
and become pan of die solid trunk 
of IPFW athletics. 

Well-adjusted teams can survive 
and even possibly forge an identity, 
but the student populous is better 
served by a collective identity. 

And in the long run, these adilcLc 
teams will be able to rest on a 
stronger foundation of history and 
tradition.
