Reading for

"Ideas float within, chained 
to mechanisms less than 
ideal for sharing them." 



By Stephen Horner 

hornvOieiplw.edu 



To begin with charac- 
terization and analogy, 
everyone reads with a 
different approach, with 
varying skill and a unique 
ability to conceptualize 
ideas. After all, that is the 
ultimate goal of reading: 
conceptualization. 

Books are simply a hur- 
dle in the form of bind- 
ing paper and ink. Ideas 
Qoat within, chained to 
mechanisms less than 
ideal for sharing them. 

Some books may de- 
mandsecondsforvarious 
pages, while other books 
maydemandminutesper 
page. Individual pages 
themselves constrict the 
flow of _^_^^^^^^_ 
ideas 



with 
line 
breaks 
and 



"Books are simply a hurdle in 
the form of binding paper and 



less understanding than 
simply exploring the 
mind itself. 

Researchers have ex- 
plored the physiologi- 
cal aspect of reading 
for hundreds of years. 
Movements of the eye it- 
self from angle to angle, 
termed saccades, are the 
fastest external move- 
ment the human body 
can make. This mechan- 
ic of the eye scans from 
line to line, taking as lit- 
tle as 200ms up to 400ms 
per word. This involves 
a vast collaborative neu- 
rological process: visual 
processing, semantic 
processing, syntactic 
processing, and text in- 
tegration (Perfetti &amp; Bol- 
ger). 

Other researchers ex-

reading 
by ana- 
lyzing 
text it- 
self. The 
' yi Rauding 
Reading 
Theory is used to calcu- 
late the grade level of text. 
Based on this system, a 
text's reading dynamics 
are determined by the 
level of vocabulary, com- 
plexity of ideas and style 
of expression. These 
three elements deter- 
mine how fast the reader 
should proceed through 
each passage. Rather 
than reading for speed,

note can bookmark off the dynamic changes 
that mark each move of 
the author's text. 

If the reader does not 
internally pronounce 
each word, comprehen- 
sion rarely occurs, but vi- 
sual memory does. This 
allows the reader to scan 
over text at the speed 
of the eyes' movement, 
unhampered by individ- 
ual words or concepts, 
sweeping over text at as 
little as 100ms per line. 
This does not replace 
interior vocalization but

Along with 
many students on the 
IPFW campus who have 
not looked away from 
their college experience 
long enough to focus 
on the political climate, 
there are those students 
who are serious and ded-

that the people respon-

Being middle class has

Medical Building

By LOUISA DANIELSON 
Danila02@ipfw.edu 



By spring of 2009, there 
will be a new face on 
campus - the new Medi- 
cal Education Building, 
currently under 
construction 
between the 
Gates Sports 
Center, Wil- 
liams Theater 
and the new 
music building. 
Fund- 
ing for the medical build- 
ing was authorized by an 
Indiana state legislative 
session in 2003, allow- 
ing Indiana University 
to build the new struc- 
ture on campus in Fort 
Wayne. 

Indiana University has 
been handling most of 
the details of construc- 
tion, from building de- 
sign to hiring contrac- 
tors. "This is really an 
IU... building project," 
said Walt Branson, Vice 
Chancellor of Financial 
Affairs for IPFW. "IU in- 
volves us in the plan- 
ning, the aesthetics, the 
Iocation...so it would 
fit in with the campus. 
They've been very, very 
good about (that)." 

Currently, the IPFW

He also said that "(The 
new medical building) 
will house .laboratories 
with advanced instru- 
ments and technology 
for faculty research and 
support community 
health organizations and 
functions." 

Local construc- 
tion company Wei gand is 
handling the entire proj- 
ect. Completion of the 
newbuildingis anticipat- 
ed to be sometime in No- 
vember of 2008. The de- 
partment is expected to 
move in and be ready for 



classes by spring of 2009. 
"It's a very aggressive 
schedule," noted Bran- 
son. The building will be 
shaped something like a 
V with one basement and 
two stories. 

"We're going to 
add more parking by 
next summer," Branson 
promised, noting the 
tight accommodations 
currently available. 

Long-range plans an-

► Pregnancy 

From Page 1 



It is placed in the vagina 
for three weeks and then 
removed and stored in a 
container for one week, 
during which the woman 
will have her menstrual 
period. The woman will 
reinsert the same ring 
again for another three 
weeks and so on for one 
year. 

While participating in 
the study, women must 
keep a diary card, where 
they record information 
including any time they 
have sexual 
course, any time 
their partner 
uses a condom 
or other form 
of birth control, 
and any problems 
they have. 

According to the 
patient consent 
form, women in 
the study may use 
a condom to protect 
againstsexually transmit 




ted diseases. But women 
should not participate 
if they need sexual part- 
ners to use condoms 
each time they have sex 
because it interferes with 
testing the ring's effec- 
tiveness of preventing 
pregnancy. 
Researchers will use the 
diary card and the infor- 
mation gathered from 
various tests and clinical 
visits, to assess how well 
women are reacting to 
the RING and how well it 
is working. 

It is not yet known 
how much the 
ring will cost 
and if or when it 
will be available. 
Women partici- 
pating in the study 
will be paid about 
$500 to reimburse 
them for time 
and effort they 
put into visiting 
.doctors and completing 



the requited 
paperwork, but 
Muse said he 
doesn't want 
the money 
alone to be the 
reason women 
sign up. 

"I'm hoping 
that people 
volunteer for 
this study be- 
cause they see 
it as a method 
of contracep- 
tion that they 
especially like 
the idea of," he 
said. 

The study is sponsored 
by the National Institute 
of Child Health and Hu- 
man Development and 
Population Council, 

which is paying the costs 
of the study. Eastern Vir- 
ginia Medical School is 
sponsoring the study at 
UK. 

Women will be accept- 




ed to participate in the 
study until early spring 
and can withdraw at any 
time. '

Underachiever 



By KELLY MCLENDON 

mdek01@iplvii.edu 



While researching for 
an English paper in the 
library, an article that 
read, "Do Grades Really 
Matter?" from MacLean's 
magazine, the Canadian 
equivalent to caught my 
attention. 

The article started off by 
boldly printing, "A grow- 
ing body of evidence sug- 
gests they Igradesl don't 
predict success. It turns 
out that C+ students are 
the ones who end up 
running the world." 

The subject interested 
me from the beginning, 
as I got average grades 
in high school and con- 
tinue to get just average 
scores in college. 

"Fifteen years after 
graduation, academic 
champions had turned 
into solid citizens, but 
not one achieved off- 
the-charts success." says 
the article.

feet test score. The ar- 
ticle goes back to the 
common question, "Do 
grades really matter?" 

According to this arti- 
cle, they don't. 



The purpose of this ar- 
ticle is to give all the C 
students out there hope. 
Hope that just because 
they may not be able 
to ace an algebra test, 



Sure, having a near doesn't mean they aren't

romantic relationships." 
the article continues. 



students." 

Now, that line is quite 
promising. For the C stu- 
dents, anyway. 

Grades seem to cause 
much turmoil thesedays. 
Take for example the 
guy from The University 



lust wait, though. This of Massachusetts who 
protested his C grade in 
federal court a few weeks 



article is not necessar- 
ily saying that people 
who are truly smart and 
dedicated to doing well 
in school don't succeed 
later in life. 



He didn't believe the 
grade was an accurate 
statement of his achieve- 



ment and took the case 
to the court after a teach- 
ing assistant curved the 
students' grade's. 

The bottom line with 
this case is the fact that 
grades don't measure 
how smart the person is 
and where they go in life. 
Sure, grades count for 
many things, but the oc- 
casional C or even F on 
an exam is nothing to be 
concerned about. It hap- 
pens. 

However, whether it 
was the right move to 
take a bad grade to the 
federal court is disputed. 

"If every student that 
didn't like his or her 
grade started to do this, 
we'd have to hire, 1 don't 
know, 25,000 attorneys," 
Catharine Porter, an of- 
ficial with -UMass-Am- 
herst said in a Boston, 
com news article. 

So, forget being called 
an underachiever, just 
because you get an occa- 
sional bad grade. 

Try your best and be 
happy knowing you tried 
your very best to get 
good grades. 



FDR 



I Great Leader or 

I Huge Failure 



By BRANDON HARNISH 



When the conversa- 
tion turns to the greatest 
Presidentsin U.S. History, 
professional historians 
invariably place Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt in the 
top three. This fact alone 
is perhaps the greatest 
reason why not to listen 
to academia. The depth 
of the adoration the 
court historians have for 
presidents who expand 
the power of the central 
state is matched only by 
theirprofound economic 
ignorance, and likewise, 
the ignorance of FDR. 
Old rubber legs' agricul- 
tural policies were, as 






historian Thomas Woods 
sarcastically writes, "in a 
class of genius all their 
own." The crackpot 
economic advisors sur- 
rounding FDR had con- 
vinced the feeble mind- 
ed dupe of a president 
that low food prices were 
hampering recovery 
from the Great Depres- 
sion. In response, and in 
an effort to raise prices, 
FDR embarked on a 
campaign of butchery 
and destruction in which 
m ill ion s of 1 i ves toe k we re 
deliberately killed and 
millions of acres of crops 
were plowed under. 
How exactly this was 
supposed to help a peo- 
ple whose own Depart- 
ment of Agriculture had 
just recently determined 
that not enough food 
was being produced 
| to provide a mere 
subsistence diet is 
still unclear. Howev- 



er, clear as crystal in this 
analysis is the obvious 
fact that far from being 
a "great president" FDR's 
policies did in fact pro- 
long the Great Depres- 
sion. 

Sure, raising food 
prices might, in theory, 
improve the conditions 
of farmers; however, 
everyone who eats is 
consequently worse off. 
Eventually, the practice 
of overtly slitting pig 
throats and scorching 
fields of corn was eventu- 
ally replaced with a more 
public relations friendly 
measure of paying farm- 
ers not to produce dieir 
goods in the first place. 
And so began a string of 
unemployment. A 1936 
article from Cornell Uni- 
versity's James E. Boyle 
observed that the Agri- 
cultural Adjustment Act, 
under which these ar- 
cane idiocies took place, 



was directly responsible 
for the unemployment 
of at least two million 
Americans, in particu- 
lar sharecroppers and 
farm hands. Not surpris- 
ingly, this policy of help- 
ing starving people by 
destroying food barely 
skims the surface of a 
long-long list of blun- 
ders by FDR. It is well es- 
tablished that his entire 
New Deal was a parasite 
on the struggling econo- 
my of the 1930s. And his 
deceitful measures con- 
cerning U.S. entry into 
WW2 have recently been 
unearthed. 

In retrospect, it re- 
ally shouldn't come as a 
surprise that FDR ranks 
highly in the question- 
naires. 

Afterall, ifyou've man- 
aged to trudge through

not on their commit- 
ment to the Constitu- 
tion, keeping the U.S. out 
of war, or any steadfast 
fidelity to individual lib- 
erty, but rather on ambi- 
guities such as presiden- 
tial "vision," "setting an 
agenda," and "moral au- 
thority." The presidential 
rankings, though utterly 
meaningless and void of 



any substance, do pro- 
vide a lovely framework 
in which journalists such 
as myself can write ar- 
ticles demolishing civic 
myths. And in that spirit, 
I think next time I'll tack- 
le the greatest presiden- 
tial folklore of all, Abra- 
ham Lincoln. In regards 
to FDR's agricultural pol- 
icies, I'll leave you with a 
quip from John T. Flynn, 
"During the campaign, 



Roosevelt had told the 
voters that they would 
see no cruel jokes like 
plowing up cotton or not 
planting wheat or buying 
up crops to raise prices, 
all of which had been 
urged on by farmers. He 
had a plan, he said, that 
would not cost the gov- 
ernment a dollar. What- 
ever became of that plan 
we shall never know."

Zachary Homback's 

Guide to Ghost Hunting 

In the spirit of the season, this list of helpful hints and tips 
to ghost hunting has been compiled. This guide is written in 
humor and with a particular mood in mind, it does not condone 
tomfoolery. Remember, never trespass on private property. This 
is illegal and you may be arrested. 

1. Go at night. 

While ghost hunting may be done in the daytime, going at night 
not only supplements the mood of the expedition but you're 
also more likely to experience the paranormal. 

2. Bring a flashlight. 

Ghost hunting often occurs in graveyards and at sites where the 
terrain is not to be trusted. Bringing along a flashlight helps to 
keep falls and running into tilings to a minimum. It also helps to 
read signs, gravestones and generally see in the dark. 

3. Drive a reliable car. 

Out there in the field ifyour car suddenly shuts down or won't 
start again, it should be due to paranormal forces and not be- 
cause of the car itself. 

4. Wear dark clothing. 

This not only helps to boost the mood of the expedition, but you 
also don't want to mistake a person for a ghost. 

5. Don't trespass on private property. 

I cannot stress this enough. Trespassing is a crime, and you can 
be arrested for it. 

6. Bring a camera with a flash. 

If you want to catch pictures of ectoplasmic mist or ghostly 
orbs, I would suggest bringing along a camera with a flash 
- preferably a digital camera. Its recommended thai you lake 
two pictures in a row so that it is easier to distinguish between 
something spectral and reflected light. 

7. Go in a group. 

I will say this once: there is safety in numbers. If you've never 
seen a horror film of any kind, let me tell you this - those that 
stray from the group are the first to die. So stick together. There 
should be none of this, "Lets split up gang!" 

8. Go to a diner afterwords. 

This is more of a recommendation than a rule. It helps to come 
back from something that quite possibly has just scared the 
pants off of you and get some food and some friendly service. 




"Even a man who is pure in heart and says his 

prayers by night may become a wolf when 

the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is 

bright."

Piano Recital With Panayis Lyras 



By LOUISA DANIELSON 
Danila02@ipfw.edu 

Pianist Panayis Lyras gave 
a recital in the new Rhinehart 
Recital Hall. The acoustically 
pleasing hall provided a lovely 
canvas for the performance. 

The recital began with 
Mendelssohn's Trois Fantaisies 
ou Caprices, Op. 16. Accord- 
ing to Lyras, this work was cre- 
ated as a response to a journey 
Mendelssohn took to England 
in 1829. During his travels, he 
stayed with the Taylor fam- 
ily, which had three daugh- 
ters. The three movements of 
the Fantaisies were inspired by 
these daughters, Ann, Leonora 
and Susan. 

The first movement (Ann) 
had a meandering theme in- 
terspersed with skipping ar- 
peggios. The second move- 
ment (Leonora) opened with 
quick, anxious notes and rip- 
pling tones that cascaded to a 
chorded close. Lyras also men- 



tioned that this movement was 
used in the movie The Wizard 
of Oz as Toto is escaping the 
Wicked Witch of the West. For 
the third movement, (Susan) 
Mendelssohn painted a slow 
river of notes that gracefully 
wandered through the audito- 
rium. 

The next work was 
Beethoven's Sonata no. 3 in 
C Major, op. 2 no. 3. In true 
Beethoven style the piano 
erupted in mad flashes of 
chords, pounding through the 
melody. Of the final move- 
ment, it was most interesting 
to notice a familiar theme; the 
same tune was used on Mr. 
Rogers' Neighborhood as a 
fanfare in the Neighborhood 
of Make-Believe. 

Following the intermis- 
sion, Lyras performed a collec- 
tion of Chopin ballads. These 
pieces ran a gamut of flavors, 
from colorful impressionism 
to tranquil pastoral thoughts. 

At the conclusion of his re- 
cital, Lyras was called back for 



an encore. In response, he ac- 
quiesced. "I'd like to dedicate 
this Chopin waltz to you as a 
thanks to you for all you have 
done for us." he bowed towards 
Ruth Rhinehart, the sponsor 
of the auditorium who was 
in attendance. The following 
waltz was graceful, the notes 
shimmering under the crystal 
chandelier above. In the si- 
lence after his final notes, Mrs. 
Rhinehart called "Thank you!" 
Immediate applause followed.

Don't let 'Mr. Brooks' pass unnoticed 



DVD Review 

By AARON THOMAS 
Thomam08@ipfw.edu 

This is quite possibly my 
favorite movie that came 
out this whole summer, and 
it slipped past an awful lot 
of people. 

At its center is Earl Brooks 
[Kevin Costner), a fabulous- 
ly well-to-do businessman 
with a wife, a daughter in 
college, and a secret addic- 
tion. 

It's been two whole years 
since he has intentionally 
taken the life of a human 
being, but as the opening 
line says: "The hunger has 
returned to Mr. Brooks's 
brain." 

The part of his head that 



hungers to kill presents it- 
self in the form of a sepa- 
rate human being (William 
Hurt), who argues with him 
and antagonizes him con- 
stantly. 

Mr. Brooks, who mut- 
ters Bible scripture to him- 
self throughout the film, is 



COiTNlB MOoAl

K 



a man tortured by his ad- 
diction, wanting dearly to 
fulfill himself with only his 
faith and family. 

A photographer (Dane 
Cook) inadvertently wit- 
nesses Mr. Brooks fulfilling 
the addiction and will not 
let him stop cold-turkey be- 
cause now he wants to see it 
again. 

Demi Moore plays a cop 
trying to track down Mr. 
Brooks, known only to her 
as The Thumbprint Killer. 

There's even more to this 
array of complex charac- 
ters who are struggling with 
forces beyond their control 
and understanding, but it 
all falls under the wing of 
this deeply disturbed man. 

This was just the bare 
bones of it, but this is one of 
the best films of 2007.

Tis the season for some good eatin' 



By KELLY MCLENDON 



The beginning of 
October means all of 
the good television 
shows are back on the 
air, leaves are begin- 
ning to change colors 
and best of all, fall food 
also returns. Who can 
resist candy apples, 
caramel com, sugared 
pecans, pumpkin pie, 
jellied cranberries and 
apple cider? 



Although the John- 
ny Appleseed Festival 
ended a few weeks ago, 
many places around 
town are still stocking 
fall favorites. 

Starbucks brought 
back their amazing 
Pumpkin Spice Latte, 
which is perfect with 
whipped creme and cin- 
namon sprinkles. An 
unlikely combination 
is the Pumpkin Spice 
Chai Latte, which adds a 
slightly different taste to 
the regular drink. 




AJso serving up 
fall favorites is Pan era 
Bread. Panera also of- 
fers a Pumpkin 
Spice Latte, as 
well as a deli- 
cious Caramel 
one. The latest 
pastry at 
restaurant 
Caramel Apple 
artisan pastry. Cara- 
mel sauce and apples 
together make the per- 
fect pastry filling. 

Those who enjoy a 
short drive can go to 
Hilger's Farm Market to 
pick up apples, pies and 
other seasonal produce. 
Hilger's is having their 
annual pumpkin festi- 
val, which is designed 
for kids, but works per- 
fectly well for any age. 
The farm market of- 
fers hayrides and other 
events throughout the 
fall season. They also 
have an interesting se- 
lection of Halloween 
candy. 

More about the food 
selection, a few restau- 
rants in the area are 
serving up many delec- 
table fall desserts like 
pumpkin cheesecake, 
caramel apple pie and 
of course, seasonal pe- 



tty Biaggi's warm apple 
crostata, which is basi- 
cally just cooked apples

in a pastry. 

Speaking of apples, 
there are so many dif- 
ferent kinds of apples 
out there. Washington, 
Mcintosh, and Gala - 
the list is endless. 

Customers can also 
pick their own apples 
at Advanced Tree Tech- 
nology in New Haven. 
Huntington Orchards in 
Huntington allows cus- 
tomers to pick theirown 
apples and pumpkins 
as well. There are many 
health-related benefits 
to consuming fall food 
this season. According 
to www.allaboutapples. 
com, "Scientific studies 
suggest eating apples 
on a regular basis may 
help prevent certain 
diseases and improve 
your overall health." So, 
there's a great reason to 
buy a bag of apples. 
Eating pumpkin 
can and pumpkin pie. If pie also seems to have 
you're an apple fanatic, added health benefits. 



"Pumpkins are an ex- 
cellent source of beta 
carotene," says Yahoo! 
Health. "Pump- 
kin seeds are also 
gaining popular- 
ity and are rich 
in nutrients. The 
seeds are sources 
of protein, fiber, 
iron, and linole- 
nicacid." 

Among others, Aspen 



Coffee and Firefly Coffee 
House offer many other 
amazing fall treats. The 
Higher Grounds 1PFW 
kiosk has a great cin- 
namon hot tea, which 
is absolutely perfect for 
the upcoming colder 
days. Check out the 
restaurants and coffee 
shops around town to 
find more fall food fa- 
vorites.

Fort Wayne Scary? Why yes it is! 



By OLIVIA JOHNSTON 
Johnoc01@ipfw.edu 

Looking for a Hallow- 
een fright? Fort Wayne 
and the surrounding ar- 
eas have the answer. Of- 
fering everything from 
jails to caves, there are 
plenty of places to get 
spooked. 

In Columbia City, 
about a 30 minute drive 
from IPFW, there is an old 
jail. According to legend, 
a man named Deimos 
Nosferato haunts the jail 
after being beaten and 
imprisoned by guards 
during a hanging. The 
jail offers an exciting mix 
of creatures and pris- 
oners. Going from one 
floor to the next and back 
again, there are creatures 
around every corner and 
in every hiding spot wait- 
ing. Admission is only S9 
and it takes about 30-45 
minutes to get through. 
Oh, and be careful at the 



end! 

Not far from Columbia 
City is the Haunted Hotel 
in Huntington. While the 
drive is a little lengthy, the 
scare is definitely worth 
it. After paving the $9 ad-

The final haunt 
of Fort Wayne is the

Auburn Road. This is 
the final year for the 
Haunted Castle in its 
original location. Ad- 
mission is S14 dollars 
to both attractions and 
$8 for one. In the Castle, 
you will wind your way 
through several rooms, 
up stairs, down slides 
and around obstacles. 
In the Black Forest, you 
will meet several angry 
creatures. Finding your 
way through the forest 
is not the hard part, the 
hard part is outrunning 
the men with chain- 
saws. Lines tend to be 
long, so total time usu- 
ally adds up to around 
2-3 hours for both. 

The five attractions 
in Fort Wayne and the 
surrounding areas offer 
a wide variety of scares, 
haunts and frights. Be 
sure to check them out!
