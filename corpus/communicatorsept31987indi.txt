In its first regular meeting of the 
school year, the Student Senate voted 
to repudiate Chancellor Tom Wal- 
lace's new smoking policy, to honor 
former Dean John Ulmer and to pro- 
vide office space for the Black 
Collegiate Caucus. 

The Senate vote not to support 
Chancellor Wallace's smoking policy 
was unanimous. The resolution, spon- 
sored by Senator Robert Bishop, 
criticized the Chancellor's final report 
for "negating the purpose" o( both the 
Student and Faculty Senates' earlier 
smoking proposals. 

Specifically, the resolution criticized 
the Chancellor for deleting separately 
ventilated areas for smokers and non- 
smokers and deemed existing smoke- 
free areas insufficient. In floor debate, 
Vice-President Phil Downs noted the 
Chancellor's changes have left the 
smoking policy with no enforcement 

Nonetheless, passage raises the 
possibility of a veto by President Kurt 
Gregory who supports the Chancellor's 
smoking policy. Under the Constitu- 
tion, Gregory has seven days to ap- 
prove or veto the resolution. 

The Senate also took the occasion to 

Enrollment 
predicted 
to increase 

Late registration and drop/add ac- 
tivities are still progressing at IPFW, 
but officials are already predicting an 
increase in fall-semester enrollments 
and credit hours of two lo three per- 
cent. Last year's fall enrollment was 
10,182, and the number of credit hours 
was 82, BBS, 

One predictor of the increase is [he 
number of accepted applications for 
admission. To date, the records show 

'4.363 admissions, compared to last 
fall's total of 4,351; 

•1,793 new beginning students, 
compared to last fall's total of 1,713; 

•788 transfer students, compared to 
i9Se'slol^luf721; and 

'930 re-entering students, compared 
to last year's 858. 

John C, Dahl, registrar and assist- 
ant vice chancellor for information 
systems, relates the increase to 
greater recruiting efforls, the new, 
will-received Student Orientation and 
Registration iSOAR) Program, more 
advising opportunities, and expanded 
class offerings, ' 

Started in mid-July and promoted 
by an alumni phonalhon, SOAR 
brought students and parents to cam- 
pus for get-acquainted programs 
which included faculty talks, a video 
presentation, and campus tours. Fall 
activities begin with the Chancellor's 
All-Campus Picnic on Aug. 28 and 
continue with "success seminars" on 
how-to topics and social functions at 
athletic events. 

Class offerings have been increased, 
Dahl said, to meet student demand in 
courses necessary for degree pro- 
grams and to expand opportunities for 
new students lo take any needed 
remedial work early in their college 
careers. 

Areas of expansion are biology la- 
boratories; communications; basic, 
remedial, and advanced mathematics; 
several areas of business; interior 
design; reading and study skills; basic 
engineering; and electrical engineer- 
ing. Where the budget permitted, new 
classes were created, and in other 
cases, class sizes were increased 
slightly, he said. 

Academic advising concentrated on 
individual appointments with un- 
decided students and those in guided 
studies to ease and speed the process 
of registering, said Donna Worthley, 
Student Academic Counseling Services 
director For the past two years, con- 
tinuing students have Iwen encouraged 
to see departmental advisers to plan 
fall schedules during April or May, 
she said. 

Late registration and drop/add ac- 
tivilies end Friday, and final figures 
will be known early next week.

mark the resignalion of Dean Ulmer, 
The body unanimously passed a reso- 
lution, introduced by Bishop granting 
the former dean of Student Services 
the title of "Advisor to Students' Gov- 
ernment Emeritus ' and made him 
"ex-officio memtwr of the Senate and 
SUBOG and their permanent standing 
committees." 

Immediately after passage. Bishop 
then introduced a bill to present a 
plaque of appreciation to Dean Ulmer 
and to place a copy of the plaque in 
the Students' Government lobby. This 



bill was tabled to the Appropriations 
Committee to determine the cost of 
the proposal. 

During floor debate. Bishop denied 
either piece of legislation was to be 
taken as a "jibe" at Chancellor Wal- 
lace, but to honor Ulmer, Ulmer re- 
signed last July at the request of 
former Vice- Chan cell or Edward A. 
Nicholson. Ulmer retains his position 
as an associate professor of education. 

The final order of business was to 
grant Students' Government office 
space lo the Black Collegiate Caucus, 



After a lengthy discussion, the Senate 
voted unanimously to grant the BCC 
the southern half of Walb 229 But 
since that room officially t&gt;elongs lo 
SUBOG, not Senate, SUBOG will also 
have lo approve l&gt;efore BCC can move 

While SUBOG chair Indra Mat- 
ulionis supported the move in both the 
Senate and SUBOG meetings, SUBOG 
was unable to grant final approval in 
its meeting because a quorum was 
absent and those members present 
wished to examine the room. 







International students hold meeting

International group hosts picnic 



Despite occasional drizzle and un- 
seasonably chilly temperatures, the 
International Student's Organization 
Picnic was held last Friday afternoon 
at Shoaff Park, The picnic featured 
turkey and roast beef sandwiches, 
vegetables and cookies and ended with 
a soccer game. 

The picnic is the fii^t event on the 
ISO calendar According to Dr, Phillip 
Kennell, the director of the office of 
International Services, future events 
include; on Sunday, Oct. 4. potluck; a 
native coslume parly, Sunday. Nov. 8, 
and a Christmas parly Thursday, Dec, 



17. All these evens will take place in 
the Walb Memorial Union Ballroom 
from 5 to B p.m. 

Regular club meetings are on Mon- 
days from noon to 2 p,m, in Walb 21 
and 21A, Kennell said the two meet- 
ings per monlh will feature guesi lec- 
tures such as faculty or students 
speaking on some aspect of inter- 
national life. The Monday, Sept. 28 
lecture will be delivered by Or, Wen- 
hui Tsai of the sociology department 
on industrial Taiwan. 

The International Rendezvous Hour, 
held every Friday from 3 to 5 p.m. in 
Walb rooms 224-228, is a more in- 
formal exchange of members and 



internationalexperiences. 

Everyone is invited to attend these 
events. 

Vice president Bill Moore, an 
American who spent twelve years 
helping his missionary father in 
Brazil, poinled out the ISO is not a 
"foreign students organization. We're 
the International Students' Organiza- 
tion," he said, "and the United Stales 
is international." 

In fact, Kennell slated the club was 
founded in part due to recognition of 
Fort Wayne's status as an 
international city. 

The office of International Services 
is located in Walb lia. 



New parking guidelines govern IPFW 



BY JUDY I^AMSEV 
Stall Writer 

Changes have been made in parking 
lots e, 7, 9, 10 and 11 this year due to a 
recent study and recommendations 
made by the University Police and 
Safety Department. These changes 
were approved and accepted by the 
University Resource and Policy 
Committee and the Faculty Senate. 

According to Steve Roby, chief di- 
rector of the University Police and 
Safety Department, "Complaints of 
inadequate parking, personal obser- 
vations of the utilization of some 
areas, reduction of traffic congestion 
in Lot 11 on the west side of campus, 
and being responsive to campus 
needs." instigated the study on park- 
ing conducted by the department and 
their ultimate recommendations for 
the changes which were subsequently 
Implemented. 

The parking changes which have 
occurred on campus this year are as 
follows: The area designated to "A" 
permit holders on Lot 7 no longer 
changes to "A-B" after 5 p.m.; lot 11 
is restricted to "A" permit holders 
only, and thirty parking meters have 
been installed on this lot for visitor 
parking; lots 6 and 9 are still re- 
stricted to "A" permit holders during 
the day but change lo "A-B" parking 
after S p.m,; and some of the parking 
meters in Lot 10 have been eliminated. 

Automobiles will t&gt;e ticketed and/or 
towed away at the owner's expense if 
found parked on the grass or illegally 



parked on any of the parking lots on 
campus. Students are advised lo park 
on Lots 2 and 12 when parking is 
unavailable elsewhere. 

Bicyclists are urged to park their 
bicycles in the racks provided near 
KetUer Hall on Lot 9, in front of 
Helmke Library, near Neff Hall on Lot 
6, and on the west side of the Walb 
Memorial Union Building, Any bicy- 
cles found chained to lamp posts. 



trees, stairways or inside buildings 
will be impounded, and the owner will 
tie required to pay a fine to recover 
his or her bicycle. 

All of the parking rules and regula- 
tions, including the new changes cited 
above, are in the "Vehicle Regulations 
and Emergency Information" 
pamphlet Permit holders may contact 
the University Police and Safety De- 
partment for further information.

Students' Government 
lacks needed patience 



On Wednesday, Aug. 26, Students' 
Government held its first official 
meeting of the new school year. At 
the meeting, the Student Union 
Board of Governors and Student 
Senators voted on the Black Col- 
legian Caucus, Dean Ulmer's 
Emeritus Status, and Chancellor 
Wallace's smoking policy. 

Ah, yes, the smoking policy. The 
policy that establishes ninety-eight 
percent of this campus as smoke 
free. The policy leaves only two 
percent available to the students, 
faculty, and staff who smoke. 

It would seem two percent is not 
space enough for non-smokers to 
fret about. 

But it was space enough for the 
Students" Government senators, led 
by Rob Bishop, to find fault with. 

It seems Bishop and his sup- 
porters, including Phil Downs, 
student body vice president, were 
not pleased with the poHcy Wallace 
implemented. 

The main reason stated for this 
objection was the policy does not 
provide adequate smoke free areas. 
Adequate smoke free areas? 
Ninety-eight percent of this cam- 
pus, as of Sept. 1, is smoke free. Is 
this not adequate enough? 

Does Student Senate propose to 
totally disregard a person's con- 



stitutional right to have the free- 
dom of choice to smoke? With only 
two percent of the campus allowing 
smoking, the need for ventilation, if 
there is such a need with this pol- 
icy, could surely be put on the back 
burner until next spring, when 
Wallace said the policy would be 
reviewed. 

Wallace has previously stated, 
"If there are any critics to this 
policy, then they should come forth 
with another solution." 

So far all that has been observed 
is criticism by Student Senate. If 
the policy does not reach their 
standards, then why wasn't an al- 
ternative solution proposed by 
Senate? 

Maybe one possible solution is for 
Student Senate to adopt a little of 
Wallace's patience. Patience 
enough to sit back and observe a 
policy for a semester. Patience to 
wait until next spring to start 
causing waves with smokers. After 
all, it has only been in effect three 
days. And don't forget, senators, 
smokers, as well as non-smokers, 
voted for you. 

It is to be hoped Student Body 
President Kurt Gregory will find 
patience with his Senate, possibly 
enough to veto this resolution. 




Orientation successful Letter s- 

for incoming students 



BY DIANE BIR 
Stalf Writer 

"Who am I, aod what on 
earth am I doing here?" 

Phrases like (his are 
he^rd a tot - especially dur- 
ing the first weeks of 
school. The challenge of 
welcoming new students to 
college is not an easy task. 
To make a person feel wel- 
come and pari of the school 
community is even more 
dlfncult- 

COMMENTARY 

studies show the first five 
weeks of school are the 
most LmportaDt ones when 
students fit into the stnic- 
lure of learning. tPFW is 
trying to alleviate some of 
the initial obstacles 

by having a Freshmao 
Orientation. 

Dividing students by in- 
tended majors and de- 
pa rlmen Is. invitations were 
sent to them and their par- 
ents (if applicable) to join 
the school for the day. An 
enclosed map of the campus 
made certain they knew 
where to go. Starting with 
coffee and danishes at 8 
a.m., folders and pencils 
were distributed to all. 

Next the group moved 
into (he lecture hall in the 
Classroom-Medical Build- 
ing, where everyone was 
greeted by several people, 
among them. Karl 
Zimmerman of the Ad- 
missions Office, and Tom 
Wallace, our chancellor. 

After that a video lour of 
the campus was provided 
by some of the more sea- 
soned students, proving in- 
deed that some people do 
know their way around. 
There were also a couple of 
short lectures on note tak- 
ing and study habits. Then 
the group was divided by 
color-coded name tags into 
smaller groups and went to 
chat with the faculty. 

A((er forty -five minutes o( 
general hints and sugges- 
bons about what to expect 
from college and teachers 
alike, they went on to an- 



other room to talk with ex- 
perienced students. 

Seeing people who have 
been through this before 
really took the pressure off, 
and after brief in- 
troductions, the questions 
flew "Do we get our 
knuckles smacked for 
chewing gum in class?" 
"Can we go to the t&gt;athroom 
without asking per- 
mission?", and "Are 
teachers really human?" 
were a few of the more im- 
portant ones. A getting-to- 
know-you quiz got things 
rolling, and then things 
were off and runniDg 
(literally) on a scavenger 
hunt I 

Designed to help quick- 
leam the campus grounds 
and buildings, the group 
rushed from here to there, 
gathering clues and getting 
a basic idea of what was 
where. It may have looked 
easier on the video tour, but 
one can manage to find all 
Che buildings! The first 
group back from the tour 
won the grand prize - a 
pizza from Pizza Hut. IFFW 
tee-shirts were the consola- 
tion prize. 

Lunch of hot dogs, beans 
and veggies, was donated 
by IPFW, Down from the 
lunch line was a con- 
glomerate of tables, each 
representing a portion of 
what IPFW has to offer in a 
more social light. 

With over forty organiza- 
tions at the campus, one 
could join everything from 
a fraternity or sorority 
complete wilh Rush Week, 
to joining the Council for 
the Recognition of Disabled 
Students. The Black Col- 
legian Caucus was repre- 
sented, as was The Com- 
municator. IPFW's award 
winning newspaper. 

Each pathway had 
pamphlets and information 
on what is available for the 
students of IPFW. For those 
who really are unsure of 
what to be when they grow 
up. Career Services has a 
varietv of tests and books to 
show different options. 



After lunch, students 
were reunited with their 
parents, then there were 
more meetings with advis- 
ors and faculty, until things 
ended with, "See you on the 
24th!" 

The start of Freshman 
Ohenlation is the brain- 
storming effort of admin- 
istration, faculty, and stU' 
dents alike to help develop 
a strong feeling of warmth 
and camaraderie on the 
college campus. The im- 
mediate interaction be- 
tween students and the 
administration help the so- 
cial and cultural develop- 
ment of the college 
student. 

To help students feel like 
they are part of the crowd, 
and make the learning ex- 
perience an enjoyable and 
important part of life and 
growing up is part of the 
long range plan. 

IPFW is not slopping with 
Orientation either. A cam- 
pus-wide picnic was held on 
Aug. 28, and the cafeteria 
hours have been changed as 
well as the food, to encour- 
age and accommodate more 
students. Modules are being 
designed to help all the stu- 
dents, new and old, on 
studying, note- taking, lec- 
ture listening, and even 
reading a textbook! 

Students are also being 
encouraged to join in the 
extracurricular events. In- 
stead of being a couch po- 
tato and watching tube 
sports, students were en- 
couraged to come to the 
real thing and scream and 
shout. The theatrical pro- 
ductions are excellent and 
there are musical events for 
all, 

IPFW, as a college and a 
community, is trying to in- 
corporate all of (he things it 
takes lo make itself into a 
well-rounded learning cen- 
ter. The efforts of faculty, 
staff, administration and 
the students all working 
together will indeed make 
IPFW a great place to 
leam. 



Front page pic 
gives bad view 

To the Editor: 

This letter b in regards to 
the photograph that ap- 
peared on the front page of 
the August 27 Ih issue with 
the missing "ast" on the 
marquee located on the 
Athletic Center south wall. I 
found it very discouraging 
to believe the only picture 
that our new staff could 
come up with to appear in 
the rust edition of the 19S7- 
88 Communicator was one 
of a defaced marquee. 

Where were the cameras 
when our marquee spelled 
out "IPFW ■ The Pride of 
Fort Wayne"? 

IPFW has been working 
for several years to build its 
own identity and lo es- 
tablish some respectability. 
Yet it's very difficult to do 
any of the atmve if our own 
newspaper is not willing to 
help. A defaced marquee is 
dennitely not the way lo 
show respectability to 3000 
new students. 

By the way, the letters 



are missing because two 
youngsters had been throw- 
ing stones at them and they 
fell and broke,

Smoking policy 
needs change 

To the Editor: 

Recently Student Senate 
passed a resolution not lo 
endorse the chancellor's 

smoking policy. Students' 
Government is in favor of a 
smoking policy as was 
shown last year when we 
passed our own recom- 
mendation for a smoking 
policy Our document was 
very similar to that passed 
by the Faculty Senate. Our 
refusal to endorse the 
chancellor's smoking policy 
should be explained. 
Last spring. Chancellor 



Wallace appointed a com- 
mittee to implement the 
smoking policy passed by 
the Faculty Senate. This 
committee consists of three 
smokers and six non- 
smokers, which is the per-_ 
centage of smokers to non- 
smokers in this country. 
Two full time students and 
one part time student are 
memtjers of this committee. 
The committee worked hard 
all sunmier and made rec- 
ommendations tor im- 
plementation based on the 
Faculty Senate and Student 
Senate documents. 

Chancellor Wallace dis- 
regarded his committee's 
recommendations by in- 
creasing the number of 
smokmg areas and weak- 
ening enforcement consid- 
erably Over 70 percent of 
the lounges are designated 
smokmg areas. This hardly 
represents the proportion of 
smokers to nonsmokers in 
Uiis country. In^particular, 
the Studenl Senate objects 
to the designation of the 
AU\letic Center and Class- 
room-Medical Building 



lounges as smoking areas. 
Those two buildings have 
one lounge each and tioth 
lounges are located at main 
entrances and adjacent to 
classrooms, Aiso, we object 
to the north lobbies in 
Ketller Hall as designated 
smoking areas. Those areas 
are open and smoke dif- 
fuses throughout the 
building. 

The chancellor's com- 
mittee recommended a 
specific enforcement policy 
which placed the responsi- 
bility of enforcement with 
Police and Safety, The 
chancellor's policy on en- 
forcement is vague and 
merely mentions the pos- 
sibility of a Class C in- 
fraction,

know what time it is?" 

"I'm sorry, officer, you 
see I'm colorblind and I 
didn't realize that the park- 
ing sign was orange. I won't 
parte here againl " 

By now, after going down 
to Kettler GH to collect 
your fee statements, you 
wish you would have gotten 
up on those Saturdays and 
worked that over-time, in- 
stead of lying in bed lo 
noon. But, you say, the 



night before made it 
worthwhile. Well, you're 
paying for it now. 

1 can always tell when 
someone has just come 
from CM, they always have 
that certain look, like the 
morning after the night be- 
fore; like you have just 
been bombed by a BH. 

So you're working 20 and 
going to school 12, well 
that's better than the other 
way arouna. 

"Pardon me? Why are we 
called trtastodons?" WeU I 
admit it's hard lo under- 
stand now, but just wait 
until winter when you see 
the effects thai three 
months' inactivity has on 
certain people. And yes. 



those are real Mastodon 
bones mniribuled bv an ex- 
IPFW Student who wanted 
to donate his body to this 
fine institution! My eyes 
blur every lime I pass those 
precious pieces, just know- 
ing how dedicated some 



people can be to a cause. 
I'm guessing they were a 
continuing education major 
judging from the size of the 
cranium. 

I see you sophomores, 
juniors, and even, God for- 
bid seniors sneaking oeeks 



at your pink slips so you 
don't look like freshmen. 
The new-comers do It bla- 
lantly-they'U leam, after 
all this is school. 

I just have one thing to 
say to all you freshpeople, 
you look pretty in pidi.

The Chancellor's Picnic 
didn'l have as sunny a day 
as one would want, bul 
things proved to be quite 
lively anyway. 

As students went toward 
the Fort and the smell or 
beans baking, various slaff 
and faculty members 
traipsed through the halls, 
greeting everyone and tell- 
ing Ihem which direction to 

go 

More staff were inside the 
Green Room, passing out 
mountains of hoi dogs, 
chips, and vegetables, A lot 
of people were there be- 
cause of the rumors of free 
food - some even knew it 
was to welcome the new 
sludenls of IPFW, 

The picnic is pari of (he 
administration's plan to 
make studenis feel part of 
the college community It 
also is to help students be- 
come more aware of what 
social activities the college 
has lo offer.

Franklin from Community 
Relations, were just a small 
portion of the overwhelming 
number of volunteers work- 
ing on (he picnic. All the 
different departments, from 
athletics to business were 
represented 

Music was provided by 
TPFW's own Joel River on 
guitar and banjo, and his 
friend. Jim Davis, They 
played some new and some 
familiar tunes, and closed 
the picnic off with a rendi- 
tion of the Beverly Hill- 
billies, which everyone 

Even though the weather 
didn'l cooperate and the 
picnic had to be inside, the 
ants weren't bad and the 
student interaction may 
have even been better with 
the smaller space. Another

added to the belts ot the

In 



Pan Am experience: Memories will last forever 



By DARREN J. 

WAGGONER 

Managing Editor 

After months of anticipa- 
tion, the opportunity to 
work security for the Tenth 
Pan American Games was 
soon to become a reality. 
The lone obstacle now was 
one week of training. 

Training consisted of 
numerous lectures, on-sile 
work and half of one day lo 
learn one-man CPR and' Ihe 
Heimlich Maneuver. Many 
of Ihe speaker* were quite 
interesting, including the 
recenlly retired Los An- 
geles police chief, John 
Kolman. He spoke of Ihe 
history and organization of 
SWAT and reviewed in- 
strumental cases. Also in- 
teresting were talks by 
agentb of the Secret Service 
and FBI, 

Colonel James Eraser pul 
the life back into us with his 
fiery talk ot terrorism and 
how to react lo hazardous 
situations. A member of Ihe 
bomb squad taught us how 
to recognize explosives. 

U became obvious rather 
quickly that we were being 



prepared for Ihe worst pos- 
sible scenario. 

The Mam Accreditation 
Center ' MAC) was where 
every athlete, team official, 
etc,, needed lo go for 
credentials before taking 
residence al the Athlete's 
Village From Saturday. 
Aug. 1, until Saturday, Aug. 
8, 1 worked there doing a 
variety of things. Consider- 
ing Ihe Games had yet to 
start, it was, in my opinion, 
the place to lie. 

When work was slosv, a 
perfect opportunity lo talk 
with athleles was provided 
while they wailed for their 
credentials lo l&gt;e processed. 
II was quite a thrill the first 
lime I used my Spanish for 
an entire conversation. 
Since -|- only know a bit of 
Spanish, the exchange was 
fairly brief, bul still left me 
with a brilliant sense of ac- 
complishment. 

Toward the end of my 
tenure al the MAC, a triend, 



, which the foreign 
athleles were dying for. We 
gave away everything we 
had including our security 
badges and hats in ex- 
change for a lot ot El Sal- 
vador pins 

The next day we went to 
the Village with an assorl- 
menl of souvenirs. We 
talked with Iwo girls, Digna 
Quintanilla (the starting 
catcher) and Josefa Guerra 
ithe third base starter! for 
a few hours. Talking with 
them was absolutely in- 
credible and certainly not 
anything I thought I'd do 
when volunteering 

John and I made it a 
point to attend Iheir games, 
if possible We brought a 
huge "Go El Salvador'' 






ope 



Ing gai 



John, 
Womet 



and 



Softball team 
from El Salvador We 
talked to a group ot them 
for quite a while and traded 



against, of all teams, 
U.S.A. Needless to say a lot 
ot rude, unwelcomed stares 
were thrown our way. We 
didn'l care - after all, it 
was ignorant to cheer tor a 
team that we had never met 
simply because they were 
Americans when we per- 
sonally knew members of 
the E! Salvador leam 



They tost that game lo the 
eventual gold medal win- 
ners along with their fol- 
lowing five games. Not unlil 
their final game did they 
pick up a victory, beating 
Peru in extra innings. It 
was nice to see Ihem go 
home as winners even 
though they didn't seem to 
care as long as they had 
had a good time 

The remainder ot my 
slay, I worked the Conven- 
tion Center. In-lransit bus 
duly and, finally, the Nata- 
lorium. Through my ex- 
periences (both at work and 
during free Ijmei, I came to 
an extremely depressing 
conclusion. Ninety-five 
percent of the American 
athletes acted like incon- 
siderate; conceited snobs 
while ap overwhelmirvg 
majority ot the Central and 
South American athletes 



It is now quite obvious to 
me why Americans are 
generally hated throughout 
the world considering our 
athletes are the only Amer- 
icans many of them ever 



Consumer rights: Be aware 
of the variety of outlets 



You buy a new dish- 
washer that floods the 
kitchen the first time it's 
used. Or a one-week -old 
hair dryer shoots sparks. 

Take heart. You do have 
recourse. 

It you've already la ken 
the detective product back 
to the store and gotten no 
results from the clerk or 
manager, here are some 
other steps you can lake; 

First, conlaci the com- 
plaint department ot the 
product's manufacturer. If 
you're not sure who handles 
complaints i i.e. consumer 
affairs or customer rela- 
tions!, write the company 
president. You can get the 



address from the product's 
box or package. 

Typically, your letter will 
then be routed lo the com- 
plaint department. If you'd 
rather call, use long- 
distance directory assist- 
ance in Ihe'city in which the 
company is based to get the 
telephone number. It the 
product package lists an SDO 
number, use that. 

It the above doesn't help 
then contact your local 
Belter Business Bureau, 
which will advise you of 
possible methods ot re- 
course. The agency may 
even offer lo negotiate or 
mediate the situation. These 
services are usually 



cheaper and much faster 
than going lo court 

If you're still not making 
progress, contact your slate 
allorney general's office or 
consumer-affairs office . 
Either one will tell you 
which state and federal 
agencies have authority in 
your particular complain!. 
Your complaint might even 
be the start ot an in- 
vesligalion inlo the com- 
pany and possibly a civil 
lawsuit. 

The last step, initiating a 
private lawsuit. Involves the 
most risk. Don't be afraid 
lo take this step if you're 
sure you're right. But 
remember that lawyer's 
fees, court cosls and time

Ihe survey. 

"Making good grades 
consistently is a matter of 
labor, not luck, for most of 
us anyway." said Arthur 
Grehan, executive director 
tor AIM, "'Rest plays a big 
role in how we perform al 
school and on the job Even 
for heallhy young people, 
it's important." 

Sleeping on a firm, yet 
comfortable, innerspring 
mattress unit also may be 
against a back 



problem, Grehan added, 

"Orthopedic surgeons say 
sleeping on a quality in- 
nerspring unit - one that 

porlant in preventing back 
problems tor people ot all 
ages," Grehan said. 

In the college survey, 
students preferred in- 
nerspring mattresses and 
boxsprlngs to walerbeds by 
a ratio of more than two lo 
one as a choice tor a first 
t&gt;ed purchase. 

"Obviously, since our 
questions raised discussion 
on competitive products, 
tike watert&gt;eds, we had to 
have a research firm of 
impeccable reputation to 
conduct the interviews and 
report its findings," said 
Grehan. 

Research A Forecasts, 
Inc., has done studies for 
The College Board, Ameri- 
can Board of Family Phy- 
sicians and Family Prac- 
tice, and Ihc Hearst Cor- 
poration, to name a few

half 160 percent) of the 
students said they intend to 
buy an Innerspring mal- 
tress and boxspring, com- 
pared lo only 28 percent 
who will select a waterbed. 
A foam mattress met with 
favor by II percent of the 
group, and olher types of 
beds, like futons, were pre- 
ferred by two percent. 

Almost half (4i percent! 
ot those interviewed said 
they associated walerbeds 
wiih several unfavorable 
situations or negative im- 
ages. The problems with 
water beds, they said, in- 
cluded extra money spent 
on chemicals and healing, 
leaks and problems with 
landlords. Ten (in percent) 



ot this group thought wa*^ 
terbeds still had a sub-' 
culture image of "hippies; 
and free love " j 

"Although it's a safe beU 
thai mtisl of these college 
students weren't even born 
in the late i%Os when the . 
counter-culture movement,, 
was active and water beds 
were such a fad, these im- 
ages somehow still linger. "_' 
Grehan said. 

An innerspring mattress, 
and box spring combination', 
was associated by students- 
with a healthy and restful* 
night's sleep I6i percent). 
The majority ot under-' 
graduates (93 percent), 
thought innerspring beddlng^ 
was good for their back and

good buy tor the money and

Tops of the Pops 

Mellencamp swings and rocks in latest album 



By Dave Wisncr 
Staff Writer 

Greetings, music lovers. 

Seymour. IN. is not as 
well known for turning out 
rock stars, as say, Los An- 
geles or New York, but 
their one conlribulion is by 
no means insignificant. 
John Couger Mellencamp is 
rapidly on his way lo be- 
coming one of rock's most 
prolific and important 
"homeboys," 

Review 

With "The Lonesome 
Jubilee," Mellencamp cuts 
the final line that held him 
to his ".gritty rocker" pe- 



Fool." Mellencamp, 
each consecutive record, 
has grown more mature, 
poignant, and capable in his 
words and "Jubilee" re- 
veals growth in these 
categories. 

He has become a voice 
tor the common man and 
the farmer, calling atten- 
tion lo the plights and prob- 
lems of his "constituents" 
through music as well as 
legislalional lobbying of 
Congress, 

Side one kicks off with 
"Paper and Fire" and 
"'Down and Out in Par- 
adise," two rockers doubt- 



less you have heard on the 
radio already. From there 
il swings into a mellower 
speed with some beautiful 
songs, such as "Real Life'" 
and ""Cherry Bomb," in- 
cluding some fantastic 
backing vocals and melo- 
dious guitar. 

Side two really picks up, 
containing for me the high 
points of the album Start- 
ing off the side is a won- 
derful tune called "We Are 
the People." The next song, 
one of my favorites, called 
"Empty Hands" rocks yet 
gently swings with some 
beautiful playing and sing- 



■"Hot Dogs and Ham- 
burgers" and finishing with 
"Rooty Toot Toot," but they 
are still worthy pieces. 

I've heard from more 
than a few that this is Mel- 
lencamp's opus, I would not 
put "'Jubilee " above 



release, but il is a very 
good piece of work. As of 
now I believe "'Scarecrow" 
to be his greatest work, and 
I hope neither "Scdrecrow" 
nor "Jubilee" will be hU 
masterpiece, because I'm 
sure this artist is nowhere 
near finished creating emo- 
tionally moving music.

Cross country runs new 



5K 



The IPFW cross country 
team is beginning Its second 
year under the direclion of 

Coach Mike Kasl The sea- 
son will open Saturday, 
Sepl. S, with a two person 
lag learn race. 

COMMENTARY 

This may well be KasCs 
second year, but ihis is the 
first year ever to have cross 
country meets at home. 
Thai is right, Mastodon 
fans, cross country meets 
here at the IPFW campus. 
"All of our traming has 
been done on campus. We 
have a new 5K course on 
campus. We will have three 
meets here, two will be col- 
lege and one an open meet 
with the Fort Wayne track 
club," slated Kasl. 

The new 5K course runs 
behind the sports center. 
and along the river, "It is a 
tough course in spots, bul it 
is a very good mixture," 
Kast stales. 



The mcci with the Fort 
Wayne track club is a 
scholarehip run tor Cross 
Country learn members 
"We have a good scholar- 
ship fund available this 
year," said Kasl. 

Last year the cross 
country leam only had one 
returning runner from the 
year before. This year there 
are seven relurnmg run- 
ners With the seven re- 
turning. Kast also has seven 
new prospects. "I have 
twelve lo fourteen great 
runners. That is a healthy 
number," said Kast. Why 
Ihe vast majority of runners 
returning? Could it be the 
positive attitude of Ihe 
coach of this leam? "I'm 
very enthusiastic, We are 
going lo have a great year. 
The men's leam looks fine. 
This year it looks like we 
may have our first women's 
leam," said Kast. 

Kast needs five women lo 
make a team and at the 
present time, he has only 



three. Amy Bailey from 
Snider High School, who 
was fourth in the slate 800 
meters last year, and Kalhy 
Wellman are Kast's top two 
potentials. Wellman ran 
track for DeKalb High 
School. Christie Cook is an- 
other polential runner. 

"The women's course is 
only 3.1 miles," said Kast. 
"It sounds longer than it 
is." 

The opportunity is there 
tor the IPFW sludenl body 
lo earn a varsity letter in a 
major college sport. The 
positive altitude shared by 
Ihe leam members and the 
coach makes what difficulty 
one may encounter Ihal 
much more tjcarable, "You 
can have some fun and earn 
a varsity lelller. All- our 
meets are on weekends. The 
runners have a blast lo- 
gelher, You can run cross 
country and still gel good 
grades with meets only 
taking one day a week," 



said Kast. 

The leam has been prac- 
ticing since Aug. 1. six days 
a week. The team usually 
meets at 6 p.m.; on 
Wednesdays they meet al 4 



■■We're getting into 
specifics this year. Last 
year I rebuilt. This year we 
can get much more lechni- 
cal. We^re building 
strength, endurance, and 
speed," said Kasl, 

The opportunity is there 
for getting involved on 
campus. Don't pass it up. 
Contact Kasl through Ihe 
athletic department, or fill 
out the coupon and mail it 
to his office. Men and 
women are welcome. 
Women are especially 
needed so that there can be 
a women's team this year 
Let's make this the first 
year for many years to 
come of a women^s cross 
country leam.

Soccer team defense strong 




A young and in- 
experienced IPFW soccer 
leam will lake the field this 
season. The leam is void of 
seniors and the coach, 
Bronn Pfeiffer, is in his 
first year of coaching. 

Pfeiffer does have ex- 
perience playing the game, 
as he was an all-city mid- 
fielder al Wayne High 
School. He also starred for 
the Mastodons the past four 
years, earning Great Lakes 
Valley Conference honors 
the past year, and was 
named lo the all-region 
leam the past three. 

The Mastodons finished 
with a record of lO wins, six 
losses and one tie last sea- 
son, and finished second in 
the north division of the 
GLVC. In the conference 
tourney, the 'Dons ad- 
vanced to the final round 
before losing, 2 to to 
[^wjs University, 

Eight lellermen are on 
hand for Pfeiffer to work 
with and four of those were 
starters in 19B6. Being 
counted on heavily lo help 
this year's leam are junior 
Dave Vates, junior forward 
Jeff Doherty, junior goalie 
Kevin Manns, sophomore 
goalie Jerry Jenkins, soph- 



omore fullback Scolt 
Brown, sophomore fullback 
Mark Zumbraegcl. Another 
letleri\'inner, Phil Downs, 
dropped off the leam due to 
other commitments. 

Yates is the top reluming 
scorer with three goals and 
two assists, followed by 
Doherty in the number with 
one goal and (wo assists. 
Mann, the number one 
goalie last season, recorded 
four shutouts and 44 saves 
in 12 games He gave up IG 
goals. Jenkins saw action in 
six games, recording two 
shutouts and allowing 12 
goals. 

"We are strong on de- 
fense but weak in the for- 
ward line. Our goal position 
is real good bul we need 
guys who can play all over 
the field," said Pfeiffer. 

"Tm counting on Mann to 
do a lot for us. He is a real 
good goalie, one of Ihe t&gt;esl 
in the conference. He prob- 
ably should have made all- 
conference last season," 
Pfeiffer said. 

"Incoming freshmen who 
should really help are Scoll 
Roberts (FB), from Wayne 
and Rico Ignace (.mid- 
fielder), from Harding," 
added Pfeiffer, 



Pfeiffer feels that Lewis 
University will be the fa- 
vorite in the GLVC along 
with Southern Indiana and 
Northern Kentucky, 

"I'm optomislic and ap- 
prehensive almut this leam 
because they are so young, 
but we'll find out how good 
we arc ncMl WedocstUy, 



Sept, 9, when we face 

Northern Kentucky, one of 
the best teams in the . 
country, ■■ said Pfeiffer. 

The Northern Kentucky 
game is on the road. The 
home opener is Saturday, 
Sept. 12, against Eastern 
Michigan al 1:30 p.m.
