Bresnick helps public

By CHERYL MYERS-SANDY

The Purdue- Indiana Theatre and 
Robert Bresnick have done s noble 
thing. They have tried to make ac- 
cnsible la Uw general public, a

—Moliere. Shakespeare, Sophocles, 
Aristophanes, Moliere. Voltaire— it la a 
hallmark of thing? Incomprehensible to 
come, IF you are a member of the 
"general public." 

Thank goodness mere are kind- 
hearted, condescending souls In Die 
world who will labor to help us un- 
derstand s classic like PIT'S latest 
production. "The Miser." 

Without their help, we might be 
forced in sll through a play as it was 

surely we wouldbelnst- 

"The Miser" Is a beauliMly 
exaggerated tale ol a cold-hearted 
skinflint of a man named Harpagon. 
who values money more than his 
reputation, his children's happiness or 
the welfare oT the less fortunate. He 
schemes to marry (he lovely Marianne. 



For example, a black (rlend of Har- 
pagon's son walks across (he stage with 
a ghetto blaster. In talking about 
Marianne's preferences in men, the 
matchmaker. Frotine, refers to young 
men, Adonis and John Travolta and old 
men. Saturn and GeorgeBums. 

Though this comedy was meant to be 
absurd, these references to our own 
presenl day seemed to be saying, "In 
case you don't know who Adonis is, 
we'll throw in John Travolta. Even i

That is exactly what the play should

Review 



While I must applaude the director, 
Robert Bresnick, far his courage to be 
atypical. I would suggest he analyze 
more carefully how his attempts may 
be interpreted by his audience, whether 
his Inferences are mlenllonaJ or not. 

The best production of "The Miser" is 
one that captures most precisely the 
spirit and delivery of the original 
Moliere. While some changes are 
necessary, nothing is more distracting 
than a director's fingerprints In' 
terspersed throughout a performance 

As for the actual production and 
acting of Iheplay, I would grade It a B, 
mare for sincerity and effort than the 
actual product. The stage was 
necessarily sparse, but seemed over- 
empty and did nothing to add to the 
play It (tit hollow. 

Mike Foiel as Harpagon was quite 



disllkable. and therefore, succeeded In 
his role He has excellent voice 
protection and elocution and was not 
afraid to be ridiculous. His remper- 
lanlrums were properly childish and 
his anilely over losing his money was 
related well. He displayed, however, a 
ralher limited emotional spectrum 
otherwise and fluctuated between being 
entertaining and monotonous. 

James Hodginas Cleante. the son. did 
a respectable job of being not-too- 
bright. 

Elise. the daughter, played by Gwen 
Auld, wos quite funny at times. 

Auld, for all the world, sounds and 
looks like Mary Gross on "Saturday 
Night Live," whether this is Intentional 

Since I like Mary Gross' humor, I 
found myself liking Gwen Auld. 

Denlse VanOrt. as the oft referred to 
Marianne, was a title too subdued even 
for the humble, blindly obedient, back- 
bone I ess c hara cler M olie re c realed. 

Scott Aurand, as Valere, wos quick 
and bright and over-played his role with 
vigor. Of all the cast, he and Kim Kelly 
as Master Jaques were the most true to 
burlesque and charmingly absurd 
Kelly especially was good at slapstick 
and other visual humor. 

Fro sine, the slightly slovenly match- 
maker, was portrayed by Deborah 
Sandman. Her entreaties to Harpagon 

disappeared into the background when 
otherswereonstage. 

The audience was divided on ac- 
ceptance of the play. While a few in- 
dividuals did not return after in-

Mural to be mounted to Neff

If weather cooperates, (he south wall 
of Neff Hall will don a mural depicting 
Indiana history by Christmna, said 
John Carnaghl. vice chancellor of 
fin an rial a tf tin. 

The mural Is CDrrently being con- 
structed at the physical plant and will 
be bolted lo Naff by Wlgdan Con- 
struction of Fort Wayne. 

Construct ion of theproject consists of 
ceramic liles weighing 8-10 pounds 
each. The tiles will then be applied toa 
base with an epoxy. A solution 



developed by Kaiser Chemical Cor- 
poration to prevent weathering will be 
applied once the mural Is mounted. 

The finished work will be 20 feet high 
and 1Z feel wide. A construction expert 
from Lafayette came to make 
suggestions to university ollidals about 
how the mural should be hung, but 
construe! ion technology students 
worked out the problems. 

Four donors have each provided

conceived "about a year ago," Car-

Dual role part of life for Schmidt 



By RANDY 

Staff writer 

When asked what his family thinks or 
his dual role as teacher and politician, 
Donald Schmidt, associate professor of 
mechanical engineering technology, Is 
quick to mention that dinner con- 
versations are usually very Interesting 

Besides being an instructor at IPFW, 
Schmidt spends his Tuesday nights In 
the Fort Wayne City Council Chambers 
as a councilman from the 2nd district. 

Schmidt may be remembered from 
the city's ISM election as the only 
Republican who won. 

Although he said being a professor 
does not cSreeily alfect bis council 
work, he does have students approach 
him occasionally to ask questions about 
dty affairs. 

"That doesn't happen often though," 
Schmidt said "And usually just with 
the hot Issues." 

He also feds being a teacher gives 
him more freedom to pursue his council 
wort — more freedom than someone 
like a factory worker would have. 

"Being on campua gives me 
flexibility. In terms of time, that is a 
tremendous asset," Schmidt said 

When m emergency arises or a 
meeting conflicts with a dasa, 
however, Schmidt usually gets an In- 
structor lo cover tor blm. 

Other professon are not only oc- 
casional substitutes for Schmidt, they 
are also vocal advisors for the coun- 



cilman. "My fellow colleagues are 
extremely interested in what Is going 
on In the dty and willing to discuss 
Issues. That Is very helpful to me, Il 
helps bring up viewpoints I can use In 
art! cula tin g discuss ions . " 

Schmidt welcomes this Input and 
hopes il continues. He seeks Input not 
just from teachers but also from 
students, although he mentioned some 
students Jusl don' I seem Interested In 
dty affairs, 

"It Is hard lo get an out-of-town 
(student's! opinion," Schmidt said 
"although, (these students) could get 
me a fresh opinion on some iasues." 

Schmidt, a councilman since 1971, 
graduated from Purdue University In 
I960 with a bacfador'l degree In 
mechanical engineering. He received 
his master's degree from Purdue a 
year later. He then went to Western 
Michigan University where he worked 
in the registrar's office He came to 
IPFW In via where be has been ever 

Schmidt doesn't fed he has ever been 
trapped Into choosing between school 
and city, and likes to bdieve he can use 
his Jobs lo stimulate dialogue between 
the different fa dio ns. 

For example, at one time be assisted 
In starting communication between the 
school and New Pride which ia trying to 
gel a stadium built on county land lhat 
has been leased to IPFW.

Truth found in 
computer ads 
despite hype 

By DEB HARM EN I NC 



magaiine advertisements arc ear-

Allhough much o! Ihc advertising is

(he promotional gimmicks and people 
should be aware lhat the computer age 
Is upon us, experts say. 

"The micro-computer revolution 
laking place Is going lo put computers 
everywhere and It's necessary tor 
people (o understand how computers 
function and lo feel comfortable using 
Ihetn," said Robert Barrett, chairman 
of computer lechnology. 

Although it's essential for people lo 
be computer literate and understand 
their capabilities, there's no need to 
rush out and purchase a home com- 
puter, said Mainard Mansfield, 
chairman of ihe department of 

Most people, unless they're computer 
buffs, become disillusioned after they 
purchase a home computer because 
they realize (hey lack the knowledge to 
put ihc computer to effective use. The 
computer ends up being a game device 
tor Ihe kids. 

As the computer age advances and 
the need for individuals to be computer 
literate becomes more apparent. It's 
obvious high school and college com- 
puter programs will have to be 




restructured In order to fit students' 
needs, said Michael O'Hear, coor- 
dinator of transitional studies. 

Computer courses are becoming 
more widely available in high Schools 
and students are learning basic func- 
tions and understanding what com- 
pters have to offer 

"There's certainly a value in knowing 
how to use a computer," O'Hear said. 
"As far as education is concerned, 
computers are a real help when it 
comes lo problem solving." 

Allhough It Is important for students 
lo be computer literate, it's doubtful a 
computer course will be a requirement 
tor oil students at IPFW in the near 
future Computer literacy, however. Is 



fieldssuch as engineering 
and programming because many 
sciences utilize computers for research 
purposes, Barrett said 

A problem many students face when 
first taking a computer course is fear, 



feelings of fear and gain hands-on 
experience, they discover working with 
a computer is not so difficult, Barrett 
said. 

"Computers are a great leaching 
device and as they become more user 
friendly, or easier to use. students will 
start taking advantage of computer 
courses ollered" he said "Every

In the last two years. Die TPEW-tlhletic 
department has made great stride* Being 
accepted Into the Great Lakes Valley Con- 
ference as a Division It contender has given 
Ihe department a push in making a name for 
itself 

During thelasl month, however, same valid 
questions have been raised about ihce(h)eUc 
department's Inlentions. Women's basketball 
'coach Kirk Kavanaugh said too much em- 
*' phasls Is being placed on the men's "basketball 
team at the 01 poise of other sports. 
Kavanaugh was particularly upset over the 
amount of scholarship money allocated to the 
men's basketball team compared to ihe other 
teams He eipecls the men's basketball team 
to receive more money, bin he didn't eipect 
nthcr [tarns lo receive so lillle. The. men's

baskelball should recelye. the 
scfao la rshi p mo ney. 



Other teams should, however, receive more 
even If It means taking money out of the 
men's baskelball fund. 

The near 3-1 ratio between the men's and 
women's baskelball teams and the even wider 
ratios between the men's basketball team and 
other learns should be reduced. 

The athletic department's reasons for 
emphasizing men's basketball Is to provide 
Enough full men's basketball scholarships to 
me*l Ihe GLVC's average of 12 scholarships 
given other GLVC men's baskelball teams. 
IPFW presently has enough funds to provide 
9.1 full men's baskelball scholarships. In 
reaching this average, the athletic depart- 
ment must also uphold its responsibility to all 
athletes — don't let other sports suffer because 
alltheeggsareputinonebaskei. 

According to the athletic department, 
coaches of various sports are responsible for 
promoting their teams with some help from 
the athletic department. This could cause 
conflict between other coaches and ul- 
timately hinder the athletic department's 
growth All coaches should get together and

the last and no doubt least ol 
J.S. Bach's 20 some children. 
Schickele tells the audience, 
once walked non-stop for

istakes review &gt; 



forgotten lore 

Steve Goodman, the 
composer and singer, 
warmed up Ihe audience 
with story songs which set 
the stage Tor Carlln's look at 
life. "The City of New 
Orleans." a song made 
Famous by Arto Guthrie In 
the early 70s about a 
decaying passenger train as 
it made its run, headed 
Goodman's set of original 
compositions. "How Much 
Tequila Did f Drink Last 
Night?" and "The Dying 
Cubs Fan's Last Request" 
suggest by their titles the 
activities described in song. 
The former ol these has a 
line which expresses a 
mom I ng-afler surprise. 

"Someone has rearranged

Carlin said, "but in my own,

The set ot requests which 
followed included those 
things which aredear to him 
such as good shoes, not being 
a flop, and nymphomaniac

Though the list was sub- 
stantially longer, it typified 
the ridiculous items which 
any person might request ol 
God— which don't seem 
ridiculous to the person 
making the request. 

The section on driving had 
another technique which 

used— general Izalion. 

"A big, Iron thing. That's

All Night," catapulted the 
group to fame. 

The two who have been 
through Kiss' thick and thin, 
Stanley and Simmons, 
simply refuse to give up. 
Stanley's vocal range Is 
limited and unspectacular, 
but blends well with the 
thick. layered guitar sound of 
Vincenl, Simmons, and 
Stanley himself. 

Simmons, on the other 
hand, seems to be mired in 
the past with his evil demon 
image in "Not For The 
Innocent," and "Fits Like A 
Glove." Although noncof Ihe

taken more than 10 minutes
