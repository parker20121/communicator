Maybe you think you know 
all Ihere is lo keep yourself free 
from sexually iransmilietl dis- 
ease!h but more likely than not. 
you don'l. More than eight million 
people under (he age of 25 have an 
STD. ll is during those years Ihal 
most people are very sexually 
active. Riereforc it is very impor- 
tant Uiat the facts are presented to 
keep young adults from contraa- 
ing and spreading sexually trans- 
milted diseases. 

"Each new generation needs to 
bear the infonnalinn again because 
that age group always feel invul- 
nerable," said Sharon Broom, pub- 
lic relations director for the 
American Social Health 
Associations (ASHA). 

So, have there been any 
noticeable changes in the numb^ 
of cases since the hotline's incep- 
tion? According to Broom, the 
numbers of ca.ses continually fluc- 
tuate. However, people are still 
searching for knowledge on this 
subject as the amount of calls has 
risen steadily since its beginning in 
J979. 

Some migtiT'asl:, ""Why do 
we even need these hoilmes? Why 
can't people just talk to their doc- 
lore','" For some it is not easy being 
facc-lo-face with a medical profes- 
sional. That is when these hotlines 
become helpful 

"Hoiluies are tembly impor- 
tant because of the sensitive sub- 
ject matter. People are very embar- 
rassed to talk to someone in per- 
son. The hotline offers them 
anonymity," said Broom. 

You are invited to take the 
following quiz, and decide if you 
need to call the National STD 
Hodine al (800) 227-8922. Hours 
of operadon are from 8 a.m. to 1 1 
p.m. Eastern time. Monday 
through Friday. 

1. 1 can't get a sexually transmitted 
disease if I don't have intercourse 
(penetration). 

2. All types of birth control will 
protect me frran STDs. 

3. The most common STD on col- 
lege campuses is human papillo- 
mavirus (HPV). the virus that 
causes genital wans, 

4. AIDS is not a [voblem on col- 
lege campuses. 

5. Wal STDs (like genital wans 
and bcqies) cannot be cured. 

6 Condoms provide 100 percent 
protection from HPV. 

7. All STDs have symptoms. 

8. If 1 gel an STD, 1 will never be 
able to have sex again-ever. 

9. Women arc at greater risk than 
men for STDs. 



STDs . . . very unattractive 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



The facLs are in: college stu- 
dents are more likely to acquire a 
sexually transmitted disease. Why? 
Because they are more hkely to 
have multiple parmcrs. engage m 
promLscuous behavior, fail to use 
any form of contraception and 
engage in activities with partners 
who are also usually at risk 

The increased prevalence of 
STDs on college campuses can also 
be atmbuied lo the misinformation 
that young adults tend to circulate 
among themselves 

"Young people who call the hoi- 
Lne frequently have miseoncepuons 
ahoul how STDs are spread," says 
Marshall Glover, director of the 
National STD Hotline. 

Calls received by the hoUine are 
typical of the attitudes most at risk 
people have. Here arc some exam- 
ples of comments heard: 

* I won't coniracl an STD. This 
demonstrates an attitude of invul- 
nerability, which enables a large 
number of young adults to hide 
from the facts. According to 
American Social Health Association 
statistics, two-thirds of new sexual- 
ly transmitted disease infections 
occur in people under 25. 

• You won't contact an STD if 
you are on the Pill Correction; 
you may not become pregnant if 
you're on the Pill. Hormonal fonns 
of coniracepuves do noUiing to pro- 
tea a woman from STDs Neither 
do birth control implants or injec- 
tions. 




Amorous feelings abound on campus, but is it safe?

Briefly ... the news 



Campus 

The bombs are back 

Tlie bomb tiucats are back at IPt^. Last Monday a bomb tiireat was 
called into KetUei Hall at 10:20 a.m. As usual, the sirens were armed and 
the building was evacuated while a search was done of the area for any 
explosive devices 

The search did not turn up any evidence of a bomb. Classes, students 
and faculty were allowed to return at 1 1:30 a.m. 

"It's early for this," said Ll Thomas Haner of campus police. "There 
were no tests scheduled. There could have been quizzes We don't receive 
thai information " 

The peak lime for bomb threats on campus is at mid-terms and fmals 
week and all of \be tests are re-scheduled Most of the threats are centered 
on Kettier Hall, although other buildings have at times been involved.

Ostrich fowls police Mother Teresa dies 



Last Sunday night die Allen County PoUce Department received 
numerous calls concerning an 8-foot-tall bud. Apparently, an ostrich was 
roaming the area around Winchester and Dunkelberg roads and had creat- 
ed a few scares with the residents 

The ostncb was spotted wandering the countryside, moving in and out 
of farmer's fields. A few volunteers combed the area without turning up 
the large bird. When they came in range of the ostrich it would dash off. 
Although an ostnch can not fly, it is an excellent runner with strong legs 
and dangerous claws. 

Allen County Police are unsure who the bird belongs lo. but il is legal 
to own and raise an ostrich. If you spot the bird or know who owns it con- 
taa tiie Allen County Police non-emergency line at 449-3000. 



Another humanitarian has died tiiis pa.st week. On Friday night Mother 
Teresa died of a bean attack and she will be buned a week to the day of 
Princess Diana's funeral 

Modier Teresa's burial ceremony will be opened to the public and 
wdl be held in Uie 10,000-seai siadium where Pope John Paul II 
addressed followers in a 1986 visii to India. 

Motiier Teresa had suffered bean aihnents and other problems for 
some lime and last March she had given up leadership of her order 

Motiier Teresa had been known to say that she could see God in every 
suffering human bemg. She began her charity work witii just a couple 
odicr volunteers five decades ago and now her order has more than 
4,000 nuns and runs 517 orphanages, htmes for the poor, AIDS hospices 
and other chanties around the world.

college education 

There is a graduating senior on 
the Communicator staff who has 
had no minority instructors. Why? 

The study presents interesting if 
not lemfying results in terms of 
grade distribution. 

The July study stales, "These 
data illustrate that in ten of the 
eleven middle schools in the FWCS. 
African-American and Hispanic 
males received a greater percenuge 
of two or more 



counicrpans " 
t Based on 

ihe results of the 
study, we Ihink it 
is approprute to 
fear similar ca-

Although the 
study deals with 
area middle 
schools IPFW 
could be at risk 
regarding the 
treatment of 
minority stu- 
dents by a pre- 
domi nantly 
"wbite bred"

But how 
do you Ihink 
minorities fare 
here? Is there a 
difTerence? Most 
would like to 
believe there is 
not. It is not fair 
for blacks or 
Latino students 
a| IPFW to be 
anxious about 
receiving grades 
from mostly 
Caucasian pro- 
fessors 

Studies 
of this magni-

as studcnLs are

for IPFW lo recognize and docu- 
ment events of mequalities and bias 
in middle schools without first 
acknowledging its own inadequa- 
cies in failing to recruit minonty 
faculty Ls embarrassing to say the 
least. 

We believe it is ridiculous for 
IPFW to point out other racial prob-

ar is supposed to have the 
same value, but this mean- 
ing gets lost with all the hype and 
unnecessary attention that individu- 
als receive. When 1 say certain indi- 
viduals, I am talking about celebn- 
ues. I know everyone is probably 
tired of hearing about the death of 
Princess Diana, but this is very rele- 
vant to what I have lo say. 

On August 16, 1997. my 29- 
year-old ciiusin was out hiking with 
some of his friends in Tatoma, 
Wash., when all of a sudden, he col- 
lapsed on the trail They revived him 
and air-lified him to the hospital. 
When he arrived, they put him on 
life suppon and did a bram scan, 
which revealed no brain activity 
whatsoever He had suffered a brain 
aneurysm Thismeant thatoncof bis 
brain's anery walls had weakened so 
much that it exploded. This condi- 
tion IS very rare and seldom delect- 
ed When this happens, the chances 
of survival are slim to none 

You are probably wondering 
why I just told you all that and there 
is a very good reason My cousin's

o J 
ipson IS anoth-

who had to deal 
with a very diffi- 
cult situation in 
^^^^^^^^ Ihe public eye. 
^^^^^^^" Everyday people 
are killed by other people Not a 
very nice thought, but it happens 
People accused of killing someone 
stand tnal for their crime just as 
everyone should, no matter who 
they are 1 fail lo see how Simpson's 
trial was anytiiing but fair and just. I 
am not saying that he commincd the 
crime, because only he knows thaL 
What I am saymg is that, once again, 
someone famous had something 
happen to him that happens to many 
people For some reason, his situa- 
tion was broadcast all over the 
media for a year and is still talked 



about. What makes him so special 
that he deserves so much attention 
for something that has happened 
before and will likely happen again? 

The JonBenet Ramsey case is 
not any different from any odier 
child murder What makes tiiis "dif- 
ferent" is she was a beauty queen. 
Well, so what! Many children are 
kidnapped or killed every year, yet 
their deaths go unnoticed by the 
masses. These children are just as 
special and imponani as JonBenet 

There is hope for us. President 
Cbnton will stand trial while still in 
office. Even though be is the 
President of the United States, he is 
still human and responsible for his 
actions He should not be exempt 
from anything a normal, everyday 
person is not His tnal should be 
conducted just die same as it would 
for anybody else, yet I know this 
will not happen. At least it is a start. 

The whole point to my rambling 
is to show that just because some 
people are famous, it does not mean 
we should treat them differently 
from anyone else. My cousin's death 
was very sudden and hard to accept, 
just as Princess Dianas, but she is 
no different from him He left 
behind a wife and family that loved 
bun very much and will miss him 
greatiy.

fusing on Music 



I was wondering if anyone 
besides me has noticed the plethora 
of bad music thai we, the suffering 
general public, has available to us? 

Now. my opinion may not agree 
with youi5. but that's okay. The 
point of all this is that I recently hs- 
tened lo some CDs at Blockbuster 
Music on Coliseum Boulevard. I 
think that this batch is fairly eclec- 
tic, but I had var&gt;'ing opinioas on all 
of L^Cjn. Jhe retail prices are hsted 
in case y«u (}&lt;'""' listen to mc and 
buy the ones you shouldn't Just 
kidding. 



Hanson — "middle of 

nowhere" S12 99 

This would really be somethmg 
10 own if I was about ten years 
younger. I hate it when teen stars 
don't remember that they are kids. 
In one song, these kids actually sing 
about being called another guy's 
name while m the throes of adoles- 
cent passion ("Speechless"). It hap- 
pens to be one of the best songs on 
the disc, besides the catchy. 
"MMMbop." "Speechless" has a 
raw, seventies edge that I would not 
have thought these guys were capa- 
ble of if I had not heard it for 
myself. 

Many of the 11 songs have the 
singer sounding like something is 
caught in bis throat; especially the 
love songs. "Thinking of You" and 
"Lucy" It is very h^d to take 
someone seriously when be sounds 
like a cross between the young 
Michael Jackson and the Partridge 
Family. 

This disc wouldn't be complete

fighl for the consumer food dollar. 
Taco Cabana features bometnadc 
'Tex Mex"-siyle cuisine, margaritas 
and beer at "fast food" speed and 
prices, served in a colorful, yci 
cozy, sit-down Mexican restaurant

of all dining worlds and it's close! 

Taco Cabana has cieaied a fun 
and inviting place lo eai. The dining 
nxim bouses a collection of brighl- 
ty-colored Mexican tite-lopped 
tables as well as a bandful of enam- 
cl-lopped tables thai sport domestic 
and imported beer logos. 

Brightly-colored patio lights are 
strung torn the ceiling, and color-

meals starling 
at S2.99. 

The feel at 
the counter is 
anydiing but fast, 
however. The open 
Idlchen is in full 
of the order counter so the 
customer can see whole 
chickens slow-roasting over a 
stone beanb and watch as flour tor- 
tillas are being hand-tossed and 
baked on a gnddle. Jamlos-brand 
Mexican soft dnnks are chilling on 
ice at the counter and samples of the 




food are on display under glass. 

Taco Cabana makes almost 
everything on its menu on the 
premises. The hot and mild salsas 
on the salsa and chip bar arc made 
fresh every day, as are the chips for 
dipping and nachos. The smoky 
Borracho (pinto) Beans are sim- 
mered up from scratch and the 
refncd beans and rice are also made 
fresh daily. 

Taco Cabana has a well-round- 
ed lunch and dinner menu fcatunng 
standard Tex Mex fare such as hard 
soft tacos, burrilos, enchiladas, 

nachos and quesadillas. Items

is most well- 
known for its chicken and beef faji- 
tas served on a sizzling iron skillei

St. Louis at Denver 

The Rams should nol be a problem for 
Denver, especially at home. But Denver and 
Elway bave a history of bailing against NFC 
teams. I guess that's only in the Super Bowl

Prediction: New England by 10 



May hold your 
attention: 

Seattle at Indianapolis 

The Colts should gel their firsl win this

IPFW) Notes 



Back from the dead'; Womens tennis on a tear 



WOMENS VOLLEYBAa: 

The Ladydons are showing that 
the preseason hype and expectations 
were well deserved after diis week- 
end's success at the Sumner Suites 
Volleyball Tournament. After an 
impressive showmg at a tournament 
in Minnesota where they compiled a 
3-1 record, the Ladydons swept all 
four of their matches heading into 
this weekend where they play home 
matches against Southern Indiana on 
Friday and Kentucky Wesleyan and 
Ferris State on Saturday. 



Tennis: 

Coach J Webb Honon has to be 
happy with his womens tennis team. 
After last years record of 2-12 over- 
all and 1-6 in the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference (GLVC), the ladies have 
changed their losing ways and are 
becoming a force in tennis. The 
ladies have already doubled their 
wins by starung the season 4-1 and 
3-0 in the GLVC. Ihis week does 
have a very large lest of their 
progress because of a tough match 
with Saint Joseph's 



Cross Country: 

The mens and womens cross 
country teams opened their season at 
the University of Southern Indiana. 
The mens team led by Adam Barton 
captured fifth place out of si)t teams 
at the invitational The womens 
team performed well but could not 
post a team score due to a lack of 
runners on the team. Both teams 
will be competing this Saturday at 
home with the mens team running at 
10 a.m and the womens team start- 
ing at 10:45 a.m 

Soccer: 

The mens soccer team opens its

J Webb Morton must have 
thought he was in a nightmare dur- 
ing his first season here at IPFW. 
He was watching his tennis team go 
through a 2-12 season and finish 1-6 
in the GLVC. Some coaches would 
have resigned themselves to a few 
years of "rebuilding" but not this 
coach He felt that taking a more 
aggressive approach would work 
and it did Going into this week, 
Morton has resurrected this program 
into a force that is raising some eye- 
brows on campus and m the confer- 
ence. 

One of the biggest persons that 
helped was Pam Bowden, women's 
basketball head coach. No, she did 
not find an extra season of eligibili- 
ty, but she did find out one of her 
basketball lecruiu was an All-State 
tennis player. Amy Bogard, IPFW's 
version of Deion Sanders, was being 



recruited for ba.sketball by Coach 
Bowden and through her suggestion 
Honon convinced Bogard il was not 
time to hang up her racket, T\vo 
other key ingredients for this suc- 
cess were the signing of two 
recmits All-NEC Dawn Carycr and 
All-SAC Jenna Marmeyer have been 
strong complements to the returning 
veterans of Melissa Hasler, Danielle 
English, and Becky Bermcs. 

The biggest surprise this season 
has to be walk-on Christina Pappe 
from Huntington North High 
School. Coach Honon described 
her as the wild card at the beginning 
because he didn't know how well 
she could play, but she has caught 
his attention along with her oppo- 
nenLs whom she is beating with reg- 
ularity
