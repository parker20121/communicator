Ihc time lo slarl planning for winter 

As soon as the groaning dies down, we 
will conlinue. 

Lost winter — even before Ihc flood 
■which everyone is now tired of hearing 
about — this area was suffering record 
cold, ice and snow Indeed, It was this 
some snow which, upon melllng, invited 
itself info our homes. 

IPFW was hit by closing after closing, 
and things did not always go smoothly 
Two examples would be Monday. Jan 30 
and Wednesday, Feb. 3. Both these 
closings were marked by delays in 
decision-making and implementation. 
Though many worked diligently, 
somclhlng was lacking. 

What was lacking, as was pointed out 
in a Feb 11 edilorial, was a plan. A well 
Ihoughl-out, written plan which could be 
posted around campus, even printed in 
the student handbook. It was suggested 
loo thai perhaps the campus should not 
be so dependent on Mayor Win Moses' 
office declaring a snow emergency 
because the mayor's office came under a 
grcul deal of criticism for lis handling of 
weather'relaied emergencies, (This Is, 
of course, before the flood made him a 
hero and TV star. ) Also he does not lake 
Into flccounl those living outside the city, 
a group that comprises about 40 percent 
of the IPFW student population. 

After that editorial, we were told by 
Ihc administration that indeed a written 
plan does exisl. In a relatively little- 
known document entitled, "The 
Emergency Plan and Procedures 
Manual." 



Upon investigation, it became ap- 
parent that the reason for many of the 
screw-ups were lo be found in the 
manual itself Many potential problems. 
which became fact last Winter, are not 
discussed in the manual, and others only 
in the vaguest terms. Neither the entire 
manual nor any relevant sections have 
ever been made available lo students. 

Though admmistralors must have 
leeway lo adapt to special cir- 
cumslances, a comprehensive and 
coheroni plan must exist upon which to 
build. 

To this end, a proposal will soon be 
introduced in the f^aculty Senate to 
undertake a study to improve upon the 
manual and establish a real set of 
guidelines for students and staff to 
follow in all emergencies. 

It was intimated to us last Februarj' 
that Ihe administration feels that there 
Is a great deal thai students don't really 
need to know about these matters. But, 
for etricieni action in time of emergency, 
people cannot be shuttled nboui like 
cattle, they must be informed as to what 
is expected of them. 

Everjone must bo aware ol: 

— under what conditions school will be 

— who Is m charge ol Ihc different 
phases of Ihc procedure, 

— where to go for information, 

— what are the best routes by which to 
leave campus 

We urge that the Faculty Senate and 
Ihe administration work togelher in 
Improving the manual and making the 
information available lo the students, 
before we again find ourselves in the 
midst of an emergency.
