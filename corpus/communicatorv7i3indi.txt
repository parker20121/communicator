Elite faculty parking 



Paid parking is in the headlines again. This is nothing new, Bl leas! not to those 
who have been here a few years. Since Ms insliiuiion in 1370, the parking fee has 
been a major irritation to students and faculty alike. 

Anything that costs will be a cause for griping, especially when it hits the 
pocketbook the same lime as tuition, the activity fee, lab fees, textbooks, etc. 
Nobody likes lo pay for any I In nf., and when pt'dple si ill ri'mtnik-r I ha I it used to be 
free, the negative impact on one's disposition is even greater. 
The complaints were usually that the lots v. 

e emplyl while "B" parkers were left to fend for themselves just 
barely this side of the Ohio line With the paving of all lots, gripe number one was 
eliminated. But gripe number two held up strong. Usually it was heard from 
■impatient students and faculty who could not wait until safety ani" 
completed its traffic count in mid-September and adjusted lot designations 
. accordingly. 

So what's new" This year all t hi' lot adjustments by safely and security are not 
', going to solve the problem. The problem is a structural one caused by the Joint 
; Parking Advisory Committee tJAPC). JPAC pushed through an amendment to the 
ting code that restricts "A" lots to facully and staff only. Students are

Now a Bose Direct/Reflecting 
bookshelf speaker and it's 
under $100. 

If you thought it couldn't be done, you don't know BOSE. 
Because the new BOSE MODEL 301 speaker is just that. A 
bookshelf speaker that provides reflected and direct sound 
performance in the tradition of the internationally-famous 
BOSE 901* and 501 speakers. 

It provides such astounding performance for its size that, 
frankly, it's hard to believe that this speaker costs under 
$100. But it does. And, it's easy to place and can be adapted 
to all room environments. 

Come in this week and ask to hear a demonstration of the 
new BOSE MODEL 301 Direct/Reflecting® bookshelf 
speaker system. You really 
won't believeye. Third Row

Why should 

a freshman at IPFW 

enroll in ROTC? 




Maybe the fol lowing 
statistics will help you 
answer that question . Of last 
year's college graduates, 40 
percent were unable to find 
employment within their 
major. And 20 percent were 
unable to find any |ob at al I . 

Now compare that to 
these figures: ail ROTC 
graduates are guaranteed 
employment immediately 
upon completion of school . 
98 percent of ROTC 
graduates are employed In 
their major field. Aren't 
those odds a little ketter? 



And that's not all. During 
your junior and senior years 
at IPFW, you will be paid 
$100, tax free. Plus S450 for 
6 weeks of Advanced Camp 
between those two years. 
Spending money you can use. 



You made a good choice 
when you picked UP F w as 
your college. Now take one 
more step into the future and 
choose ROTC. Call U.S. 
Army ROTC, Ft. Wayne, at
