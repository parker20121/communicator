Childcare options 
limited on campus 



Task force has 
taken action 
on issue 

Ramona Mcgown 
Chief Reporter 

On Ocl. 21, Marian Zimmerman, dean 
of students and chair of the Child Core 
Task Force, issued a list of ideals and 
plans (hat the task force has taken 
action upon. Also in the meeting of the 
thirteenth senate the child care issue 
came up several limes. 

"Over 85 percent indicated that they 
were satisfied with their child-care 
providers. Providing a referral service 
for those unable to locate child care on 
their own has been very successful to 
dale." said Frank Borelli. vice chancel- 
tor for student affairs. 

Several faculty members found humor 
in the fact that parents were having to 
bring their children to class with them 
for a variety of reasons. 

Robert Hawlcy, associate professor for 
human services, showc 
d great disapproval in the faculty mak- 
ing light of the situation at hand. 

"As a single parent I don't appreciate 
the humor on this. I think that we must 
realize that this is a real tragedy for par- 
ents who have no resources and must 
bring children to school. Often limes a 
baby-sitter cancels at the last minute 
and they have nothing else they can do. 
Bringing them to class might not be 
best or convenient, but the Human 



Services Handbook says students must 
attend, as it docs in nursing. A student 
is really put under a lot of stress. I think 
resources need to be available. Most 
campuses do have some sort of child 
care for their students, and I am taking 
about major campuses. At commuter 
campuses we should have even more 
resources," said Hawley. 

Both, Borelli and Zimmerman suggest 
thai the Child Care Referral Service is 
doing the best job possible to provide 
child care for those who need it. 

'"A consultant will be coming to help 
the university evaluate and analyze 
what is needed for the university." said 
Zimmerman. 

Interestingly enough, ihc task force 
does not include any parents that are 
being served in the program 

Deb Dccrc. child care referral service 
advocate, stated that most of her stu- 
dents are in great need of child care 
during the weekend, and during evening 

"Almost all of the services contacted 
through my office, offer little weekend 
child care and most cannot provide 
child care during the evening hours," 
said Deere. 

Deere also slated that her office and 
services are only the beginning for the 
university and is merely a stepping 
stone on ihe child care issue. 

As far as the EducCarc Program at 
Parkview, Deere informed the 
Communicator that very few of ihe stu- 
dents that come to her utilize this ser- 
vice. Deere, a single parent of four chil- 
dren, said thai tbe rates of the EducCare 
Program were completely out of the 
range of parents needing ihc services 
the most.

Problem of care still exists 



Students have 
difficulty 
finding sitters 



Kathryn. a mother with two children 
attends IPFW part-time two evenings 
per week. Because her husband works 
second shift, and she works days, 
evening classes arc her only option. 

Child care is a problem. As Kathryn 
found, most in-home child care 
providers (often Ihc most economical 
kind of care) choose to not work nights. 
Kathryn finally found a baby-sitter. Her 
friend decided to help her out, as a 
favor, but only until the 



Although some students al IPFW have 
temporarily solved their child care 
problems, the child care needs for these 
unusual hours arc the most difficult to 
fill, according lo Deb Deere of the 
Childcare Referral Service. 



"Finding care is next to impossible if 
you don't have a spouse 01 relative lo 
help you while you are attending 
evening classes." said one student who 
asked to remain anonymous. 

What arc some other options? Some 
purcnts drop out of school for a few 
semesters or a few years while their 
children arc small. Having lost tbe 
momentum of full-time study often bin- 
ders the returning aduli later on. 
Financial needs also play a big role in 
the options parents pursue. It can also 
limit Ihc degree options of young paj- 

" After my son started school. I decid- 
ed that I wanted lo he home in the sum- 
mers as a full-time mom. That's why I 
switched my major from nursing lo

Karen, an adult student, said that she 
was trying to gel through school as 
quickly as possible because she can't 
afford to live much longer as a single 
parent without a (ull-time job. 

All these students represent a different 
perspective of Ihc weekend college and 
evening students — yet they all share a

IPFW needs campus calendar 



Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Frank Borelli would like to sec students 
develop a comprehensive calendar of 
campus events, and put an organization 
in place lo keep the effort up and run- 
ning. 

"We did one iwo years ago, but no one 
wanted to fund it, so it dropped," 
Borelli said. 

Borelli believes that a "flip- thro ugh" 
calendar, such as the one produced by 
Ihe alhlclics department, would "facili- 



"Our students arc isolated; they may 
never get to Walb. The people here arc 
oblivious to what is going on unless 
you hit them in Ihe bead with. a sign," 
Borelli explained. 

"I don't think we should do away with 
the campus calendar; my opinion is this 
should slay. Schedules change rapidly, 
and student organizations don't do all 
of their planning in advance." 

Currently, the campus calendar is an 
IPSGA paid advertisement in ihe 
Communicator. 

Borelli added, however, "1 can't get 
much interest in this. The student orga- 
nizations would have to initiate it, bul I 
certainly would be willing to contribute 
to it if Ihe academic calendar were 
included in there." 



Perhaps a sludcnt organization will 
initiate an effort lo produce a compre- 
hensive campus calendar: "A couple of 
the senators are looking into the pro- 
duction, the cost, and so forth." said 
Sludent Body President Rajat Suri. 

Suri also said that the problem with 
previous efforts lo produce such a cal- 
endar has been that "110 office wanls to 
lake responsibility They Ihink of it as a 
liability rather than something posi- 

Dircctor of Sludent Activities Greg 

Callen referred lo Ihe previous attempts 
of the IPSGA lo publish a flip-through 
calendar: "They fell it cost to much 
money to produce, that Ihe material it 
contained was very dated in a short 
period of time, and that Ihc campus cal- 
endar printed in Ihc newspaper was a 
heller method . '. but if they publish 
one in Ihe future, I have no problem 
with that. I don'l think it's a bad idea, 
bul it's my experience that Ihe students 
just don't want it. It's a tremendous 
amount of work," 

Cullcn added that, "I'd really like to 
see a long-term commitment rather than 
they do it for a semester and quit " 

"Everybody thinks it's great lo have 
comprehensive calendar," Callen con- 
tinued. "And what I find is thai people 
are interested enough to fund it — 



Diversity problem arises

'Too often we do enough to gel by

ipon us." said Charles Washington, 
ssocinte director of career services. 
Other faculty members feel thai Ihe 
inivcrsity is pulling forth adequate 
rfforls lo provide Ihe campus with a 
diverse atmosphere "Unfortunately for 
IPFW, most minorities that have 
acquired higher degrees tend not lo 
chose our university because of the 
high competition that cxisis with other

of political science department. 
Not only docs the university have a 



problem with recruiting minority facul 
ty to ihc university, bul there is an cvi 
dent difficulty in retaining those profes 
sors that do come 10 the university. 

In October of 1990. two faculty mem- 
hers, Beverly and Gregory Bell, filed 
charges of discrimination agains 
university. In the charges filed. Ihc 
Bells claimed that Gregory was denied 
tenure and promotion in the School ol 
Educatioo. Beverly Bell filed both sex- 
ual and racial charges, while Gregory 
filed charges solely on the basis oi 
racial discrimination, 

Charles Washington is Ibc firs 
African- American male to ever have 
held an office in IPFW career services. 

"The university cannot just have

needed to go out lo Ihe campuses and

Equipped with Ph.D.s in educalion, 
Professors Myra and David Sadkcr 
began lh,cir verbal onslaught on an 
invisible war, sex bias in (he classroom, 
last Thursday during a lecture al IPFW. 

The Sadkers have been Ihe leading 
experts on this topic for ihc past 25 
years. 

"School is an organized place where 
they ore with well intenlioned adults," 
Myra Said, "You can have an amazing 

According to Sadkcr, the importance 
of recognizing sex bias is vital to 
teachers and students because it is so 
subtle. 

"This issue is so important because 
ihis is where they [the children] spend 
so much time," added Sadker. 

The Sadkers explained bow the issue 
came to their attention when they were 
in graduate school working toward their 
doctoral degrees in education. 

"It is something that experienced 
when David and I were working toward 
our doctorates. David would gel more 
verbal compliments for the assignments 
than I. So, I wrote an editorial. 'The 
Only Sociahlc Form of Social 
Discrimination.' in which I discussed 
this issue," she said. 

This was the seed that germinated into 
a career of research and lectures on this 
issue that affects the classroom and the 
workplace. 

With several humorous jokes to ease 
the atmosphere in the Classroom- 
Medical Building lecture room 159. 
David Sadker began to lay down the 
foundation by defining sex bias in the 
classroom. 



Sex bias in the classroom could be 
defined as when boys get more atten- 
tion, encouragement, and wail lime 
girls. 

To show the audience an example of 
Ihis bias in Ihe classroom, David Sadkcr 
selected four people from Ihe audience 
to role-play as students in the class- 
room. 

In the role-play, Sadkcr showed, by 
taking the role as a teacher, how il is so 
subtle. 

He repeatedly gave tbe two men par- 
ticipants more attention and praised 
than the two female students. 

Jennifer Ferry, an IPFW student, par- 
ticipated as one of the female sludents. 

"I was angry when they over looked 
me," she said. 

"It's just like any other bias. They arc 
going from overt lo covert and becom- 
ing subtle,'' Ferry added. "This is what 
makes it so dangerous." 

Debbie Weaver, principal of Claypool 
Elementary School in Warsaw 
Community Schools system, also role- 
played a female student. 

"It was very frustrating to know the 
answer and have the teacher ignore us," 
Weaver commented. 

Weaver, also president of American 
Association of University Relations in 
Warsaw, is taking the strategies of com- 
bating sex bias in Ihc classroom back to 
her school lo educate her own faculty. 

Sadkcr asked the men how Ihey felt 
when they were in the role-play. They 
responded us enjoying the attention that 
was given to them. 

From Ihe research they have done, the 
Sadkers discovered that boys receive 
more attention than girls because of 
several reasons.

14.900 Native Americans representing 
more than 103 nations living in Indiana.

Hollywood and textbook stereotypes of 
Indians are loo often, totally inaccurate 
and degrading. 

She explained lhal Indians face special 
problems. Indians are depicted as 'rene- 
gade Indians' in movies, as high school 
mascots, and even portrayed as devilish 
in college textbooks. 

"Indian culture was buried in Indiana. 
People losl everydnug if they admitted 
they were of Indian heritage, and there 
is still a carryover, especially among 
the older people, to nol admit or talk 
about Iheir ancestry." said Tuttlc. 

One topic lhat really makes her angry 



1 burial grounds. Artifacts and 
InUiun bones command high prices by 
collectors. Artifacts are buried with the 
dead to facilitate iheir journey. Any dis- 
turbance of the grave will prevent the 
loved one from reaching his or her clcs- 

"If wc dug up your ccmetaries and dis- 
played your ancestors in collections and 
museums, you would be angry, yet you 
can go lo any Native American burial

Farmers often find burial grounds when

A misconception of many non-Indians 
is the perceived way Indians arc sup. 
posed to 'look.'

ihc stereotype. Indians arc of all colors

SISTERS PERFORM DANCE 

TO HEW REUEF EFFORT IN INDIA 

On Saturday the sisters, Arpana and 
Trupti Lingaraj presented the Indian 
classical dance, Bharalanaryam (Bha 
for Bhava - moods, Ra for Raga - 
music, Ta for Tain - rhythm which com- 
prise Naiyain ■ a form of pure, rhythmic 
dance movement) on behalf of the 
earthquake victims in India, 

Bangalore P. Lingoraj, professor of 
operations management, introduced his 
daughters and the first movement of the 
dance. He drew a parallel between the 
epicenter of the earthquake al Ihe vil- 
lage Killari, and their ancestral home 
situated on Killari street in Bangalore, 
only 300 miles away, 

Lingaroj's wife Sudha, dressed in a 
black sari and bare feet, lighted the diya 
(lamp) on the floor, with matches. A 
figure of Ihc Hindu god Shiva as 
Nairaja (the dancer) was placed on a 
chair to the right of the dancers as is 
customary at the beginning of all 
Bhoralanatyam recitals, 

Arpana and Trupli Lingaraj walked on 
stage attired in yellow saris with bur- 
gundy and gold borders. Dressed identi- 
cally, they looked like iwins in spile of 
Iheir Ihree year age difference. 

Bangalore Lingaraj must have thought 
so as well, for be confused his daughter 
Arpana with Trupli, Trupti demonstrat- 
ed the dance sleps which he attributed 

"A father can afford to moke u mis- 



take between two beautiful daughters 
lhat look like me, nol Iheir mother." 
joked Bangalore Lingaraj. "Now I am 
ready to go back stage and face their 
mother." 

Over 50 people attended the perfor- 
mance. Doughnuts and coffee were 
served and collections were made 
payable to the International Student 
Organization. 

Checks can still be made out payable 
to Ihe International Sludent 
Organization and sent lo Walb 
Memorial Union, Room 118 until Nov. 
20. All donations will be sent to the 
Prune Minister's Relief Fund in India 
on Nov. 22. 

According to Ogundipc-Leslic. direc- 
tor of Women's Studies, "Il is good lo 
sec Ihc culture passed on lo Ihe chil- 
dren. I was expecting to sec some ama- 
teur piece. This is very professional." 

The recital concluded with tbe 
President of ISO. Imran Riaz requesting 
one minute of silence for all those that 
lost Iheir lives, "in this greal tragic 
event." Co-chairman for ISO, 
Maheshan Fernando thanked Bangalore 
Lingaraj, Phillip Kcnncll, director of 
International Sludent Services. Rajat

Staff Editorial 

Wanted: a campus calendar 

'How can our students participate in activities 
when they are not aware of the events?' 



At !PFW, the average age of students 
is 27 This means thai the average slu- 
denl is likely to have a job, a family, 
and a life-all of which lake precedence 
over participation in events within our 
university community. 

Undoubtedly, one of the problems fac- 
ing commuter colleges like ours is gen- 
erating interest in cumpus organiza- 
tions, and stimulating participation in 
campus events. How can our students 
participate in activities when they are 
not aware of the events? And plastering 
flyers all over windows doesn't work! 

It's true that with a student body popu- 
lation of approximately 12.000. the 
communication needs arc vast, but 
instead of plastering flyers over win- 
dows, one solution which has been pro- 
posed is a flip through calendar of acad- 
emic and sporting events. We think this 
would work. 

Now. a flip through calendar would 
not replace the Campus Calendar pub- 
lished weekly in The Communicator. 
Because times and dales of events 
change, the only way to appropriately 
address these last minute organizational 
and scheduling realities is by using the 
Campus Calendar in this newspaper. 

However, a comprehensive flip 
through calendar that catalogs major 
campus events, printed and distributed 
at the beginning of each semester, 
would allow students to plan attendance 
well in advance. Campus pride is a 
growing element at IPFW and commu- 
nication is the catalyst our students 

The biggest question of all: Who 
should be responsible for the funding 
and the production of this flip through 
calendar? 

One way to handle the situation is to 
make this calendar a university service 
to the students. We think that perhaps 
the News Bureau would be the appro- 
priate vehicle to handle a project of this 
magnitude in this manner. 

But what about student participation 
on campus? 

There is no student organization, 
besides the Student Activities Board 
and Indiana-Purdue Student 
t Association which pro- 
mising monies for tbc 



Campus Calendar, that regularly com- 
municates to our students the activities 
and events happening on campus 

Since there is a need for this student 
organization, a second option would be 
to create one which would be responis- 
blc for producing this calendar. Let's 
examine the student service fees budget 
to determine where funding would 
come from for this student organization. 

Currently, 60% of the S2.70 per credit 
hour student service fee. which we arc 
all required to pay, goes to the athletic 
department, while the remaining 40% is 
allocated to IPSGA. 

There is a 20% difference between the 
two budgets. A proposal could be made 
to take 3% of the difference to fund a 
campus organization in charge of pro- 
ducing the campus calendar bi-annually 
The leftover 17% could possibly remain 
with the athletic department or could be 
returned to IPSGA to reinstate funding 
for other worthwhile campus projects. 

Since 3% of the funding would come 
out of the athletic budget, they would 
no longer have to publish their own cal- 
endar because their events would be 
included with the academic activities in 
the new flip through calendar. 

A potential problem with this proposal 
is the loss of advertising revenue for the 
athletic department because they would 
not be producing a separate culendar 

We suggest that the athletic depart- 
ment start participating in fundraising 
activities, as do so many other campus 
organizations. This would compensate 
for the loss of advertising dollars 
besides providing a good public rela- 
tions opportunity to our many team 
players. 

In conclusion, we have provided you 
with a front page news story, a Voices 
Question, an editorial cartoon, and our 
opinion about this issue. 

Any students in support of an effort to 
produce a comprehensive calendar on a 
permanent basis should contact the 
Student Government office to inform 
your representatives of your interests. 
Be sure to specify if you would like it 
to be sponsored as a university service 
or through a student organization. 

It's up to you !

Letters to the editor 

Harassment issue addressed by IPFW student 



Dear Editor: 

I applaud your efforts in addressing 
sexual harassment; however, the edito- 
rial in the Ocl. 21 issue of Tbc 
Communicator may serve to promote 
sexual harassment, and the ignorance 
displayed should not go without cen- 

Again I applaud your efforts in assert- 
ing that women are not the only vic- 
tims of sexual harassment. Men are 
also victims of sexual harassment, and 
these men are often further traumatized 
by tbc assumption they should be 
lough enough to lake it. Many assume 
a man is somehow lacking if he 
doesn't enjoy sexual altcnlion. It is 
important that we as the public recog- 
nize all victims of sexual harassment 
equally. 

However, to state that sexual harass- 
ment is not a gender issue is at best 



gravely misleading. Sexual harassment 
is a manipulative tool used to keep the 
aggressor, overwhelmingly male, in a 
position of power and control over a 
subordinate victim, overwhelmingly 
female. This structure serves to main- 
tain tbc status quo; that currently 
means that men arc able to determine 
the rules, and women arc placed in a 
position of having to play along to get 
along. In this light sexual harassment is 
definitely a gender issue. 
The Communicator also advocates 
"responsible dress." This attitude pro- 
motes the idea that the victim is some- 
how to blame This stance is intolera- 
ble. Given the situation it seems The 
Communicator has chosen to further 
punisb the victim than punishing tbc 
offender. No woman should be forced 
to dress, act, or speak in a non-sexual 
or even male manner to avoid being 
victimized. People need lo rethink their 



interpretations. Victims do not need to 
reshape their images. The responsibili- 
ties should fall on the shoulders of the 
offenders, not the victims. 
And even if you cannot fathom 
wo/men dressing purely lo please 
themselves, consider this: If you find a 
person's dressing inviting, do not arti- 
ficially bloat your ego assuming (he 
person intends to invite advances from 
you. Such a mistake could land you in 

Also the editorial asserts, "Silence is 
consent." Wrong. Silence never con- 
notes consent. In certain intimate rela- 
tionships a party may read consent 
through non-verbal clues or mutual 
participation. However, in general, 
only direct verbal consent should be 
taken to mean consent. If you are 
unsure of whether consent has been 
granted, ask. And continue to ask until 



you get a 



. Silence does n 



mean consent. If anything, means slop. 
Again, such a mistake could land you 

And as for The Communicator's 
advice to ask yourself if you would 
like it if someone addressed you in that 
way — it's good lo think about, but 
wben you come right down to il, it 
doesn't matter. Your acceptance of a 
situation does not connote another's 
acceptance of the situation. Ask. 
always ask. 

Finally the editorial promotes sucb 
comments sucb as. "Hey, you look 
nice today." Please exercise caution 
even here. If said with roaming eyes, 
the wrong inflection, or in the wrong 
situation, even this seemingly innocu- 
ous statement could be sexual harass- 
ment. 

Please lake care in the future.

THE ENQUIRER, not from n suppos- 
edly enlightened university newspaper. 
Much of what you hove reported is nol 

'opinion."

risk during the first lawsuit against the 

University and Dr. Taylor ) flowers us 

never had in the past All of this due 

the bard work and dedication of Dr. 

John Taylor. 

Disgruntled faculty can be found in 
any department, on any campus. In this 
one such person is riding tbc legal 
coaltails of another. When oil is said 

nd done, 1 am confident that the 
University and Dr. Taylor will be vin- 
dicated. By the way, you make this 
sound as if Dr. Talyor is in this by him- 
self. Hecaruuuly is not! 

Several years ago, a group of 21 

music and art faculty showed their sup- 
port for Dr. Taylor by signing a state- 
ment which was forwarded on to the 
President or Tennessee Tech 
University, This is a group of faculty 
that includes musicians and artists who 
ore trucly nation ally and internationally 



recognized. People who are widely per- 
formed, published, commissioned, 
exhibited, and who perform in recitals 
and conceis throughout this and other 
countries of the world. This talented 
group of artists and musicians in&lt; 
four women! Women who arc too busy 
doing their jobs, making a difference in 
student's lives, as well us in the 
nation's culture, to indulge themselves 
in the misguided luxury of bringing 
lawsuit against the very people who 
support and encourage (hem. But war' 
Now I'm on the verge of'bringing pe 
tonalities into this, and I don't want I 
do that. 

Yes, I am very passionate about this 
as ore many or our faculty at Tennessee 
Tech, both in and oulsidc of the 
Department of Music and Art. For 
many reasons, I am sorry that 
course of events has happened. Sony 
for the negative inferences that il has 
brought against our University and our 
Department. But, most of all, I am 
sorry for what it has done, and contin- 
ues to do, to John Taylor. And, the 
great sbuine of il all is that none of thb 
had to happen. 

You have a rare individual, and at 
excellent leader in Dr. John Taylor. Hi 
is on outstanding musician and admin 
islrator who will bring great bonor to 
your University. If he bos a fault, it ' 
that he expects his faculty to have the 
same dedication fur the program that be 
has. That's quite a standard lo live up 



I have not addressed the facts in these 
lawsuits (oh, how I wish I could!), 
because the University is not at liberty 
to do so. Our hands are tied by the legal 
system while we watch Dr. Taylor 
assailed by others. The facts will, how- 
ever, come out one day, and - as I said 
before - I am confident that Dr. John 
Taylor will be vindicated. Unlit then, 
you can do yourself, and your 
University, a service by reporting the 
facts, and nol inuendo. Our loss ci 
your gainl

Student confronts Snyder 



To die Editor: 

While opinion is a personal view not 
necessarily based on fact, I Would hope 
that Ihc educated people at IPFW would 
use (act and courtesy in expressing 
theirs. That, I believe, is the mark of an 
enlightened, educated, and civilized 
society, and also the mark of a worthy 

It is apparently is not tbc "Mark" of 
frequent letters to The Communicator 

In the Oct. 28 issue, Mark Snyder 
responds to a letter written by Dartanya 
Porch. Because her opinion and feelings 
differ from his, he labels her "infantile," 
"pseudo-social," ''fascist," "oh-so 
enlightened," and "trendy." 

In the most recent American Heritage 
Dictionary, the definition of the words. 
fascist, includes these phrases: "o sys- 
tem of government marked by central- 
ization of authority under a dictator, 
stringent socioeconomic controls." 
"reaclionary or dictatorial person," and 



"suppression of the opposition through 
terror and censorship " How can he 
know that Dartanya Porch is of Ihis per- 
suasion? Because she wishes people 
wouldn't smoke close to (he doorways? 
Is that the mark of a fascist? If it isn't, 
his letter could be construed as libelous. 

Further, he denounces people who 
would "shore the planet with only those 
who think, act, believe, or behave" as 
they do, yet that seems to be the very 
attitude be exhibits. He obviously does 
nol want to share the planet with 
Dartanya Porch; after all, she's a fas- 
cist. right7 

The mudslinging be uses to discredit 
her, has him practicing the very behav- 
ior be claims lo be against. 

If any behavior is infantile, name-cull- 
ing is.

Non-smokers need rights 



To the Editor: 

Mark Snyder, your ignorance totally 
bewilders mc. Your letter to the edi- 
tor (10/28/93) thrives on insults to 
fellow student Dartanya Porch 
(10/21/93). who defended the rights 
of non-smokers. You fail to recognize 
the main complaint in her letter. She 
staled a very legitimate problem thai 
many non-smokers face every day, 
including me. 

Il seems that smokers like to congre- 
gate in front of the doors at Kettler 
Hall and smoke their cigarettes. This 
wouldn't be a problem if only smok- 
ers entered and exiled the building. 
However, this is not ihc case. 

Non-smokers have to pass through 
that smoke-screen every day to enter 
and exit Kettler. J, for one, do nol like 
to smell like smoke, arid I don't like 
to breathe someone's cigareite smoke 
cither. I don't think thai (he solution 
to litis problem is for the non-smok- 
ers to take another cniruncc. The 
solution is for smokers to be consid- 
erate of the non-smokers and smoke 



somewhere less central. We are not 
trying to banish smoking from the 
outside loo. 
And. YES. MR. SNYDER. YOU 
ARE IN FACT POLLUTING HER 
AIR! Her civil liberties include 
breathing fresh, clean air. You can 
pollute yours if you wish, just don'l 
pollulc our air in the process.

Campus needs healthier drinks 



Dear Editor 

Don't you just hate it when you're 
dying of thirst and the only cold drink 
choices we have in our campus vending 
machines arc pop and milk? This is a 
problem that is especially annoying 
when you are a student like me who 
spends most of her day on campus 
going from class to class and studying. 
By the time you're on you second or 
third pop you've probably had enough 
of that sweet taste of caffeine lo last a 
1 while. So you look at your other option 
- milk. What if you don't really care 



for milk, or milk isn't what you're 
looking for? 
Where are all the machines with the 
natural fruit drinks such as "Snapplc" or 
possibly even bottled water? You may 
respond by saying: what about all of (he 
drinking fountains? Well, what if you 
really don't feel like lugging around a 
water bottle just in case you want water 
later. Also, many limes the water just 
isn't as good or as cold as it should be. 
We could probably gel by without a 
vending machine wilh bottled water, 
hut I do feel a healthier drink option 



would be a positive addition to campus 
buildings. I also feel that it would be 
popular in sales among students and 
faculty. 
I hope you will lake into consideration 
all I've said and possibly take some 
action in improving the situation. 
People today arc much more health 
conscious than ever before. Having a 
healthier drink alternative would greatly 
enhance our campus.

Volleydons get third seed

Cowboys and Giants set for a showdown

Thu IPFW women's volleyball (cum 
is tin a winning slrcak and they arc 
j peaking at ihc righi lime. It's louma- 
£mcnl lime. 

The Volleydons have won 14 oul of 
ilii-ir lasl i6 matches and finished 7-2 
in GLVC siandings. This finish gave 
them a number Ihree seeding in Ihc 
GLVC tournament which decides ihc 
! conference championship. 

The top iwo finishers this season 

were Ashland and Northern 

Kentucky, who bolh finished 8-1 in 

: the GLVC. Ashland will probably 

receive the number one seeding in Ihc 

g tournament due lo a viciory over 

Northern Kentucky in hcad-to-head 

I action. 

ll'FW, against Ashland Ihis season, 
is 1-1. In Ihe early stages of Ihc sca- 
: son, the Volleydons suffered a 2-3 
defeat but then later avenged the 
defeat with a 3-2 viciory. The "Dons 
t lost lo Northern Kentucky 1-3 in Ihcir 
Only meeting Ihis season. 
Going into the tournament, however, 
all records can be thrown out the win- 
dow. The Volley don squad has been 
ihc hottest team in Ihc conference 
over the past month, and as a repre- 
sentative from Northern Kentucky 
said, "IPFW has lo be the favored 
team going in." 

On Wednesday, October 27, the 
Volleydons gained revenge against 
Huntington, which is ranked in ihc 
NAIA lop twenly. Coming into ihis 
match, Huntington was 30-4 and had 
- easily handled the Volleydons earlier 
• this season 3-1. They may have taken 
' Ihe Volleydons a bil too lightly. 

They entered the confines of Gales 
Center with easy victory on their 
; minds and left with a 3-1 loss. The 
Volleydons won Ihc match with the 
. line being 16-15, 15-8, 16-14, 7-15, 
15-4. Even though iwicc in this match 
the games had lo go lo 16 points, 
IPFW garneicd each viciory and 
secured il all with Ihe impressive 
fourth game. The viciory lifted Ihc 
Volleydons lo 16-15, above .500 for 
ihe first lime since the first game of 
the season. 

Leading Ihc way offensively in Ihis 
match were Heather Tcagarden, Julie 
. Parroi and April Dacr. Tcagarden 
.smacked 21 kills and Parrot and Baer 
had 14 and 13 respectively. Jill Lyon 
ted the team wilh 58 assists. 
Defensively, Lyon denied 
Huntington four limes wilh four 



blocks. Tcagarden had 13 digs, fol- 
lowed by Amy Scheumann wilh 12. 
Panot wilh 1 1 and Lyon with 10. 

The Volleydons garnered iwo more 
victories wilh wins this past weekend. 
On Friday. October 29, Ihe 
Volleydons registered a victory over 
the learn from Soulhern Indiana and 
on Saturday defeated the team from 
Kentucky Wcsleyan. " 

The match against Soulhern Indiana 
was a hard foughi viciory as IPFW 
came oul on lop wilh a 15-9. 11-15, 
15-8, 15-13. Southern Indiana fought 
hard lo make every game close, bul 
offense of IPFW was loo much for 
them as Baer registered 19 kills. Her 
defense also proved successful as she 
had a team-high three blocks. 
Teammate Parroi led the learn in digs 
with 11 and had Ihc serve going as 
she nailed four aces. Lyon kepi ihc 
Volleydons in line as she dished oul a 
whopping 70 assists. 

Wilh this viciory. ihe 'Dons 
improved iheir record to 17-15 and 
dropped Southern Indiana to 18-8 
overall. 

The Volleydons then took on confer- 
ence foe Kentucky Wcsleyan. As in 
Ihe match against Southern Indiana, 
Ihe games were each hard foughi bul 
IPFW slill won three games lo one. 
The final line is this one was 15-8, 
15-10, 3-15, 15-6. The 'Dons took Ihe 
firsl two games pretty handily, bul 
were shocked in the third with ihc 
wide defeat. They then turned around 
ihc match by dusling Wcsleyan in Ihe 
fourth game and Ihus clinching the 

Once again leading the offensive 
charge, Parroi and Teagarden led Ihe 
Volleydons wilh 15 kills apiece. 
Lyon contributed Ihree aces and 
added 42 assisis to her team leading 
tolal. Tcagarden and Parroi also con- 
tributed defensively as they had 14 
and 13 digs respectively. Baer, Amy 
Polvado and Teagarden also con ; 
Iributcd one block a piece. 

Through 32 matches Ihis season. 
Tcagarden and Lyon lead Ihe 
Volleydons in the offensive depart- 
ment. Teagarden has smashed 421 
kills in 1152 attempts giving her a 
percentage of .22. Lyon, in 117 
games, has handed oul 1166 assisis. 
Baer has belted out 39 service aces 
and Parrot follows wilh 38. 

As a team. Ihe 'Dons have had 1495 
kills in 4117 attempts and have 1270 
assisis. They will try to use this 
offensive punch in the upcoming 
tournament to capiure Ihc coveted 
GLVC crown.

The Fori Wayne Komcls played

This is Ihc most important game for 
bolh of these learns so far. Dallas has 
won five straight games since Emmifl 
Smith has came back from his hold- 
out. Lasl week against Philadelphia, 
Smith had 237 yards on 30 carries 
including one 67 yard touchdown run 
as ihc Cowboys won Ihe game 23-10. 
The Giants, however, lost a 10-6 deci- 
sion to the cross town rival Jew. They 
had a chance lo win in Ihe final 
minule, bui their offense was stifled 
on ihe goal line, Phil Simms passed 
for 140 yards but had one intercep- 
tion. This should be a very, very good 
ball game against two good teams. 
However, ihc Cowboys are rolling 
and arc back in Super Bowl form, and 
the Giants arc starling io struggle a 
bit. Dallas is favored by nine and a 
half points. 

Buffalo (5-1) ut New England (1-7) 

This one shouldn't even be close. 
Buffalo is starting to regain Ihc form 
thai has taken Ihcm lo the last three 
Super Bowls, They are coming off a 
game with the lowly Redskins in a 
hope to sweep last years top Ihrcc 
NFC East teams. New England is 
coming of a 9-6 loss lo Ihe 
Indianapolis Colts. The offense for Ihe 
Patriots looked good al limes, hut it 
made critical lurnovers lhal led to 
Ihcir defeat. They also used unimagi- 
nalivc plays Ihat'mighl work againsl 
the struggling Colts, bui won'l work 
against the mighty BilLs, Rookie start- 
ing quarterback Drew Bledsoe should 
see action Ihis week, bul he probably 
won'l be enough to help the Patriots 
that much. Buffalo is favored by len 

Denver (4-3) al Cleveland (5-2) 

This is a rematch of the 1987 and 
1988 AFC Conference Championship 
games. Both teams arc coming off 
not-so-good years and are starting lo 
rebound. Cleveland defeated 
Pittsburgh Iwo weeks ago to take sole 
possession of Ihc AFC Central lead as 
Eric Metcalf returned iwo punls for 
touchdowns. Even ihough they are in 
the lead, ihc Browns are slill amidst 
controversy. Former starling quarter- 
back Bernic Kosar has announced his

now oul with a shoulder injury.) 
Denver appears to be ready for Ihc 
challenge, coming off a 28-17 victory 
over ScatUc. Quarterback John Elway 
ibrew for 255 yards and Iwo touch- 
downs lasl week. Cleveland is in "The 
Dawg Pound" and is favored by two 
and a half points. 

San Diego (3-4) at Minnesota (4-2) 

The Chargers got an cxiremc lift from 
lasl week's 30-23 conference victory 
over tbc Los Angles Raiders last 
weekend. The 30 points were the most 
scored in one game by ihe Chargers 
all of this season. The defense, off of 
two interceptions in the second half, 
was indirectly responsible for ten 
points. Donald Frank had a 102 yard 
interception return off of an errant Jeff 
Hosteller pass. Tbc Vikings are com- 
ing off a game with Ihc Lions in 
which the lead in Ihe NFC Central 
was on the line. Bolh teams have had 
real problems wilh pulling points on 
the board this season, so this is a 
chance for both offenses lo score a Ut- 
ile. Expect a low scoring game, 
ihough. Minnesota is favored by four 
points. 

Seattle 1,4-4) at Houston (3-4) 

The Seahawks have won iwicc as 
many games this year as they did lasl 
year. However, this statistic is deceiv- 
ing since they won two games againsl 
the 1-7 New England Patriots and one 
againsl Ihe 0-7 Cincinnali Bengals. 
How good is ihis .learn, really? Well. 
this game againsl ihc Oilers could 
give them a good indication. The 
Oilers have won two straight, bul still 
in the overall picture, are struggling. 
The Oilers are probably going lo go 
with Warren Moon al quarterback, 
who is now a sub for Ihe injured Cody 
Carlson. Moon has slated lhal he will 
not play for Houston next year 
because he feels lhat he is a starling 
quarterback. Houston can turn their 
season around if they win. Houston is 
favored by eight and a half points. 



Pittsburgh (-1-31 at Cincinnati (0-7) 

Last lime these iwo icams played, Ihc 
Slcclers ran up and down ihe field on 
ihc hurting Bengals. This time will 
probably be no different. If noi for 
iwo breakdowns on special teams in 
Cleveland Iwo weeks ago, they would 
be atop the AFC Central. The 
Bengals, also known as Ihc ■■Bungles" 
Ibis season, have not even shown a 
trace of improvement. As a matter of 
fact, they seem to be gelling worse as 
Ihe season progresses. The only thing 
lhat Cincy has going for Ihcm right 
now is the faci that ihcy have nothing 
10 lose. The Slcclers arc favored by 
ten points. 

Tampa Buy (2-5) ut Detroit (5-2) 

These two learns met earlier Ihis sea- 
son, and they were going in totally 
opposile directions. Tampa hadn'l 
won a game yet and Detroit was unde- 
feated. Tbc result, you ask? Tampa 
Bay gels its firsl viciory of Ihe season. 
Detroit is coming off a battle for the 
division lead wilh the Vikings, and Ihc 
Buccaneers smashed Atlanta 31-24 
lasl week. Quarterback Craig Erickson 
threw for Tour touchdowns against the 
Falcons and seems to be coming of 
age. Detroit has one thing going for 
them right now, Barry Sanders' run- 
ning ability. That abilily probably 
won'l be there next season as Detroit 
refuses lo pay Sanders what he 
requests. The Lions arc favored in this 
one by 12 points. 

There arc four other contests thai arc 

going on Ihis Sunday, of which I do not 

have room to summarise. They are: 

Miami (6-1) at N.Y. Jets (3-4) Miami 

Is favored by one 

L.A. Raiders (4-3) al Chicago (3-4)

Larry Sowar of Bowers-North Productions plays trie part of detective John Fieldslorra. 



By Jo Ann Sleinforth 
Features Editor 

,Tbe Dead Don't Buy Retail" was 
(lit (heme last Wednesday at the 
Embassy Theater, as pan of the Fall 
(993 Hotel Restaurant Tourism 
tylanagement Dinner Program. 

j\ very special evening was 
enjoyed by 75 guests as amateur 
detectives witnessed a murder mys- 
tery that provided exciting enter- 
tainment and an elegant meal. 

;Tbis evening was the third of the 
dinner series and was co-sponsored 
$y Bower North Production, 
Ceruti's Catering, Channel 21 and 
the Embassy Theater. 
{Amber Stetler, a freshman major- 
iiig in the Hotel Restaurant manage- 
ment program was the student man- 
ager who planned this unusual 
evening. 

After graduation, she is looking 
forward to a career in the hotel 
Held. 

She gave us insight into what the 
students have to go through in plan- 
ning such an event. 

The students "pretend" that John 
Knight, the director of the program, 
^vorks at a "pseudo corporation in 
New York," and will be flying in 
for the dinner on Wednesday, 
i "This is so that every time some- 
filing small happens, we don't call 
him," said Sieder. 

&lt; Amber admits to feeling quite a bit 
pf stress, so her mother purchased a 
therapeutic massage for her the day 
pF the event. 

She coordinated the entire event, 
from planning the menu and hiring 
Ceruti's Catering, to hiring Bower 
North Production. 



In spite of her hectic schedule, 
Amber took time out to appear in a 
commercial with Dr. Knight that 
appeared on Channel 21. 

The evening started with a wine 
and cheese reception upstairs and 
36 botdes of Australian wines were 
donated to sample. 

The dinner consisted of Romaine 
Salad, Cornish Game Hens, Green 
Beans Amandine, Wild Rice, 
Croissants and Chocolate Mousse. 

Bower-North promote themselves 
as "a unique audience participation 
mysteries with a comic flair." The 
team of Larry Bower and Alan 
North has written and produced 
more than twenty different myster- 
ies over the past five years. 

Bower played the part of John 
Fieldstone, the super sleuth who 
solved the murder of Ubuycm 
Ahsellem.The elegant surroundings 
of the Embassy provided the back- 
drop for the perfect mystery. 

Guests were given a crime report 
to solve the mystery. Fieldstone 
gave us clues as to the weapon. 
Poor Ahsellem was not only poi- 
soned, but "shish-ke-babed" by a 
scimitar. Who would do such a das- 
tardly deed? 

The amateur detectives' mission 
was to figure out who killed 
Ubuyem Ahsellem, docked his 
yacht at Murray Beach Pier. He 
had recently purchased the Last 
Word and Testament Book 
Company, and is traveling with his 
best selling authors to promote their 
books. But, it seems someone wants 
to write the final chapter in 
Ubuyem "s book of life. 

The suspects included Delhia 
Chance, described as the Texas boll 



who is trying 1o solve a murder 

Pholo courtesy ol Df John B. Knlghl 

weevil in Ubuyem's cotton 
bumoose and authoress of "Delhia 
Chance's Desserts for Romances." 
She is not getting a fair reium on 
her royalty, and his royal highness 
might be fair game for Delhia. 

Then there is Monet Cachet. 
Monet is a wee bit miffed with the 
contract Ubuyem has provided. 
Could Monet's next contract be on' 
Ubuyem? 

Tequilla Mockingbird writes first 
person murder mysteries from two 
points of view, and intends to marry 
Ubuyem when he gels his divorce. 
Tequilla feels she's enough woman 
to fill any number of shoes, but will 
she scandalize the sandal guy? 

Mimi DuQui is a French chamber 
maid who takes pride in clean state- 
rooms and well-made beds. Her pil- 
lows are the fluffiest anywhere on 
the seven seas. It is rumored that 
Ubuyem has remembered her quite 
generously in his will. Could she be 
arranging for Ubuyem to put his 
head on her pillows for the last 
lime? 

Donna Vachon was the guest who 
volunteered to play the murder vic- 
tim "Ubuyem Ahsellem." Vachon 
spent some time in the theater, as 
she had started her own theater 
company in Chicago, "The 
Highland Players." 

"Its great to get back on stage," 
said Vachon. 

On the crime report, dinner guests 
had to solve the whodunit, the 
whogotdun, the motive, the means, 
and the opportunity. 

The super sleuth award of the 
evening went to Joe Kristoff, who

Lectures 

liy Jo Ann Sleinforth 
Ventures Editor 

Dr. Carf Sagan, world famous 
tntist and astronomer, will appear 
it the Embassy Theatre on 
November 8, at 8 pin. to discuss 
subject "Is There Intelligent 
Life on Earth?" 

Us visit is sponsored by the Fori 
Wayne Zoological Society as pari 
of the Zoo Discovery Series. This 
series bring top scientists and nat- 
ural history experts to Fort Wayne. 
Sagan's discussion will include 
the possibility of life on other ptan- 
and the ability of Earth 
dwellers to preserve the planet. 
Immediately following the discus* 
ion will be a quesupn-and-answei 
period 

The too hopes to inspire elemen- 
tary school students to study the 
sciences through this event, and 
will be making up to one-third of 
the seats available free of chargi 



received a complimentary botde of 
cordials. 

By the way, the murderer turned 
out to be Tequilla Mockingbird, 
who had a split personality. One of 
her personalities poisoned Ubuyem 
and the other personality shish-ke- 
babed him. Fieldstone figured out 
that jealousy was her motive and 
she did not have an alibi. 

Dyne Pfeffenberger provided the 
musical entertainment on the piano.

Peace programs growing 



By Jo Ann Steinforth 
Features Editor 

Richard Johnson, professor of 
German and the Director of 
Peace and Conflict Studies has 
submitted a proposal to the Arts 
and Sciences Curriculum 
Commitlee for a new program. 

A decision has not yet been 
made, but the projected date of 
implementation, if approved is 
Spring 1994. 

The proposed certificate pro- 
gram would require 15 credit 
hours distributed as follows: 
There would be three credit 
hours of intro- 
ductory credits, 
nine credit hours 
from Social and 
Behavioral 
Sciences and 
Humanities and 
three credits 
from a required 
senior project. 

As stated in the 
application form 
that was submitted for approval, 
objective of the program is to 
develop an understanding of the 
theories and methods by which 
conflict can be managed so that 
violence is minimized while 
peace and social justice are 
maximized. 

Multidisciplinary in nature. 
Peace and Conflict Studies 
involves an examination of the 
interconnectedness of philo- 
sophical, psychological, social, 
political, economic and ecologi- 




cal bases of human organization. 
Students are expected to com- 
plete an Introduction of Peace 
and Conflict studies course 
(PACS P200 the Humanities 
Perspective of PACS P20I the 
Social and Behavioral Sciences 
Perspective) and other courses. 
Johnson went further and 
explained the definition of peace 
in two ways. Negative Peace is 
defined as being the absence of 
war and Positive Peace (Manln 
Luther King used this principle) 
as the absence of war, but also 
presence of social justice. 
"This has not happened yet," 
explained 
Johnson. l 

"Notre Dame 
received a $12 
million dollar 
endowment for 
their program," 
added Johnson. 

For the last ten 
years, he has 
taught and pub- 
lished in the area 
of peace and nonviolence, espe- 
cially in Europe and the United 
States. Johnson has developed 
several courses in Peace and 
Conflict Studies: War and Peace 
in German Literature, War and 
Peace in the Film, and 
Introduction to Peace and 
Conflict Studies, to name a few. 
"There are 100 programs of 
Peace and Conflict studies 
across the nation; it is a growing 
program," said Johnson.

Aunt Louise discusses trust 




Dear Aunt Louise, 



My boyfriend wenl on vacation 
mi mc. Now, he bad Ibis vac 
planned before we met. However, 
wondering what is he doing down 
ithout me. 1 can understand a 
:cds bis freedom, but he's in 
West at o Fantasy rest. He is on d 
ing the tropics and only 
knows bow many women arc o 
boat. You know bow the tropic 
make a man's libido rise! 
He didn't even invite me to go. 
What should I do? 



Stuck in the Frozen North 



Dear Stuck in the Frozen North, 

I think you have a little case of nol 
being able to trust your man when he's 
away. Sugar-pie, trust is very important 
in any type of relationship. It sounds 
like you do nol trust your boyfriend. If 
you knew that you were going lo have a 
problem with bim going, you should 
have made your concerns known then. 

You should never take love for grant- 
ed. I am sure be is thinking about you 
right now. Sure, Ihere may be gorgeous 
women in bikinis and such prancing 
around your boyfriend, but deep down 
in bis heart, he is probably thinking of 

Your Loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

Here's my problem. I have liked this 
guy for tbc longest lime. When I come 
along, be had just broken up with an old 
girlfriend. I haven't been in a relation- 
ship for a long time, so I befriended 
him and started sending him cards 
expressing how much I like bim and all. 
Anyway, be never replied to my offer 
of forming a relationship. 

I talked to one of his close friends and 
she said thai he wanted to spend some 
time apart from people so he could get 
his life together. I can understand that. 



because now when I look back a 
situation, I can tell I pushed just a Utile 
bit too bard. 
I talked to this same close friend tbc 
other day. I found out that run 



s to km 



i he c 



again, but I don't know if I really wan 
to because of the fact that he didn't 
even tell me that be needed to spend 
time apart to get his life together. 

I do feci that be could be the m; 
my dreams, though. 

What should I do? 



I Don't Know What to Do 

Dear I Don't Know What to Do, 

This is a really good opportunity for 
you to make the best decision for your- 
self. If you really like bim. I suggest 
lhnt you meet with him again. Ask him 
why he didn't respond lo you at first. If 
he gives you an answer you feel is good 
enough, then I would go for it. Yi 
may no longer have to look for a mi 
especially if you feel this here feller c 
be the one of your dreams. 

Just don't get too wrapped up in him. I 
would bale for you lo end up gelling 
hurt again.

Music review: 'Pablo Honey' 

Radiohead deliver a good musical ride 



By Bruce W.Ander 
Production Manager 

To say lhat the group Radiohead are 
new or unique would be a disservice to 
many notable performers who have 
passed before them. Nevertheless, one 
must admit to feeling a newness about 
them, a sort-of warm familiarity com- 
bined wilh ibe assurance that Ibis 
music has never been heard before. 

To say lhat their first single, "Creep" 
is completely original would be a lie, 
but it is such a wonderful treat to hear 
ibat the listener simply does not CARE 
where the melody came from. NOW is 
all that matters. Of course, we know the 
melody belongs lo an old Hollies' lune, 
but we promise not to tell, right? 

Radiohead arc a British quintet whose 
album. "Pablo Honey," will both sur- 
prise a tot of listeners and leave some of 
them nonplused. The expectations one 
may have of the album will be dashed 
the momcnl the first sweet chords of 
"You" reverberate from the speakers. 
The alternative crowd may love Ibis 
bond, but fans of Ihe Beatles, Hollies, 
and other "simple" rock groups will gel 
mote out of Radiobead's music-if they 
are willing lo take a chance on anew 
band already too heavily identified with 
the alternative scene. 

As one who "delights in all manifesta- 



tions of the Terpsicboreon i 
writer found much lo like about the 
album "Pablo Honey," and the single 
"Creep" in particular. Ii begins slowly 
and although il never reaches escape 
velocity, it lakes Ihe listener on a won- 
derful ride through the atmosphere, 
sometimes swinging close lo Ihe lyrical 
waters, in which singer Thorn Yorke 
questions why a bcauliful woman 
would wanl anything to do with him. 
sometimes soaring up Id the skies of the 
guitars, crisp and clear, with occasional 
bursts of thunder. 
In Ihe ever-changing music scene, new 
bonds are many and old bands arc few. 
Time alone will tell if Radiohead bos 
what it really lakes lo survive, but if 
being articulate and talented ever count- 
ed for anything, they have a damn good 
shot at it. 

Last lime, this column lefi off wilh a 

very awkward sentence. It should be 
explained thai there was supposed to he 
more, but due to space constraints, it 
was unfortunately left out. However, 
here il is. Why? Hmmm. Because there 
is a lol of great music oul there, and it is 
being ignored? So gel up, go over to 
Best Buy, and BUY THESE CDs! And 
now, wilhoul further ado, here is 






In my play ir: 
"Space in Your Face" - Golaclic 

Cowboys 

Thrash and harmony? Huh? Houston's 
finest do it again. 

"Memorial Beach" - A-Ha 

What? You Ihoughl they died after 
"Take On Me?" Sheesh. On album 
number five, they're just geUing started. 

"Crimson and Blue" - PbU Keaggy 

Welcome back to the electric guilar, 
Phil. We really missed you. 

"Whatever" - Aimcc Mann 

So who needs 'LI Tuesday? An excel- 
lent artist unhindered by a mediocre 
band will always triumph! Or is that 
"Good will always triumph over evil? 
Whatever... 

"Shaved and Dangerous" - Baby 
Animals 

Suze DeMarchi and company make a 
good sophomore showing without the 
sophomoric "gee whiz, we done Iwo 
albums!" glee. Buy it. NOW. 

"Pork Soda" - Primus 

Les Claypool is one reason the suicide 
rate amongst bassists is so high. Pork 
Soda gives ihcm one more reason to 



lov 



him, and it gives me a way lo clear 
oom. Just remember to "grab your- 
a can of pork soda/and you'll 
be feelin' just fine..."
