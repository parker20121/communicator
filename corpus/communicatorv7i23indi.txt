Opinion 



Elections flop 



Black voice cries out for rights 



if you didn't want to, try and think how the candidates must feel-after 
all, they had to ask you. 

Inspite of a lively presidential race, with three good candidates, the Student 
the student bodv chose to ignore the elections, with a miserable 15 percent turning 
out to vole. No doubt most of the 85 percent who didn't vote were asked to by at 
least five people. &lt; 

The election process is a simply one, by anyone's standards. All th.il v., is 
required was to ask for a ballot, verify the fact the one was a student at IPFW, 
mark one's chimes, and deposit your ti.illul in the ballot box. A real drag!

The gold bars 

of an Army officer... 

(Information about Army ROTC at lU-Purdue) 




A second lieutenant in the 
United States Army wears a gold 
bar on each shoulder. They're not 
only the insignia of his rank, but the 
symbol of his responsibility. 

That responsibility is to lead. 
And today in an Army of better 
educated and highly motivated 
young men and women, the 
demands on a young officer are 
tougher than ever. To have soldiers 
follow orders is not enough. They 
have to follow you. 

You not only have to manage 
people, but money and machines as 
well. To make more important 
planning decisions than most young 
executives. 

The need for such people is one 
reason why Army ROTC is on 
campus at hundreds of colleges and 
universities throughout the country. 
The acquired disciplines of mind 
and spirit are important to us. The 
ability to perform under pressure is 
equally important. The people who 
demonstrate these qualities are the 
people we want to become Army 
officers. 



Army ROTC will be available to 
students on campus at lU-Purdue- 
Fort Wayne beginning next fall. 
Normally, Army ROTC is a four 
year series of courses. Taken as 
part of your academic program- 
leading to both your chosen degree 
and a commission. But current 
freshmen and sophomores, for 
whom ROTC was unavailable when 
they entered IPFW, have the 
opportunity to complete the course 
in 3 or 2 years. 

As a sophomore, you must 
complete a special six-week summ- 
er program at Fort Knox, Ky., to 
qualify for advanced ROTC courses 
in your junior year. The camp pays 
$500 plus free room and board. For 
six weeks, you'll have a chance to 
look at the Army. And we'll have a 
chance to iudge your leadership 
abilities. Before either of us make a 
commitment. Apply before April 1. 

As a freshman, you can double 
up on 1st and 2nd year courses next 
year. With no obligation until your 
lunior year. Plan to pre-register this 
spring. 

For more information, stop by 
Room 288F, Neff Hall or call 
482-5416.
