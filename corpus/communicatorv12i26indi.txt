Alcoholism affects 
collegians, others 




By WAYNE STEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

Monday morning you're 
recouperating from another hard 
weekend. You had too much todrink 
and are going to have to swear off 
for a while. You find yourself 
miserable even though the team won 
the tourney and you'll be collecting 
some bets. Rummaging through all 
the empty beer cans around the 
television set, you wonder why the 
people you invited over to watch the 
game didn't show up. That's okay, it 
just left more for you. 

Maybe it's only nine o'clock in the 
morning but you figure that a little 
"hair of the dog" is what you need to 
kill this hangover. 

Wednesday afternoon you have 
another hangover. Or perhaps it's 
the same one from Monday. 
Dragging your eyes from the floor as 
the professor walks in, you suddenly 
snap to attention as you spot test 
papers in his hand. 

When asked about this "pop" 
quiz the guy next to you looks 
askance, "This is the mid-term, he 
just reminded us last week. Don't 
you remember? " 

No, you forgot. Again. 

Friday night. The test came back 
today and the news was all bad. The 
best place to get over that is at your 
favorite bar. You call up a friend, 
but he says he can't go. You figure 
he 's lying because he hasn't wanted 
to go out in a long time. By the time 
you get through with him things 
have gotten pretty abusive. Your 
hand is shaking when you put down 
the phone. So you stay home and 
knock back a few to calm down and 
finally fall asleep. 

Your last thought as you finally 
drift off is: how did I blow another 
week? 

Can a college student be an 
alcoholic? Yes. "Alcoholism is a 
disease, an allergy to alcohol and a 
compulsion to drink," said Jack 
Bail, a volunteer at the Fort Wayne 
chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous. 

Bail knows from whence he speaks 
because, like most of the people who 
work in the office, he is an alcoholic, 

"There is no real agreement 
among medical people about the 
cause of alcoholism. Some feel that 
it is inherited, others that it is 
acquired. Bui there is evidence to 
show that if a person is raised in an 
atmosphere where the disease is 
present, say if a relative suffers, 
then that person would be more 
likely to be afflicted," Bail said. 

"Alcoholism is also a progressive 
disease, like cancer," he added. 

According to "How to Know An 
Alcoholic," a brochure put out by the 
National Council on alcoholism, the 
first stage of alcoholism is 
sometimes called "incipient 
alcoholism." The alcoholic may 
make promises to himself and 
others, tike he will do better next 
time, or he knows his limit and in- 
tends *o stick to it this time. The 
neophyte alcoholic will gulp his 
drinks and will drink before going to 
a party or event where liquor is 
being served. A craving for a drink 
al certain times of the day also will 
begin. 

During middle symptoms, 
promises and lies come thick and 
fast. An alcoholic must hide much of 
his habit to keep up the myth that he 
can stop any time he wants to. Such 
a person arrives at all occasions 
"high" and must drink before 
meals. Eating habits become erratic 
and are made up for by eating al odd 

Alcoholics in this stage are always 
complaining of being tired, worried 
or depressed and must drink lo 
overcome their feelings. 

Often this will encourage the 
alcoholic to "go on the wagon," Bail 
said. Bui, "all of us alcoholics have 
tried lo stop drinking at one time or 
another. We jusl can't do it our- 
selves." During these periods of 
abstention, the alcoholic will be 
much more Irritable than usual. 

After self-help fails -to solve the 



problem, the alcoholic will go into 
the final, advanced symptoms of his 
disease. 

Drinking is now the only activity 
that matters to the alcoholic. His 
entire life becomes an exercise in 
how to obtain booze. The alcoholic 
will be fired from jobs or quit for no 
apparent reason, and watch the 
effects of the disease on himself and 
family with indifference. 

There has been much research 
compiled on teenageand high-school 
alcoholism, on the rise in the past 
few years, but little special work has 
been done in college-age alcoholism. 
"It is estimated that 10 percent of 
the total population of this country 
suffers from alcoholism, then it 
slands to reason that about the same 
percentage of students also have it," 
Bail said. 

Bail is not afraid to use the word 
"alcoholic" whether referring lo 
himself or others. And he stresses 
that it is a physical affliction, not a 
moral one. 

"There isn't quite the social 
stigma attached to alcoholism that 
there used to be, but too many 
people still believe that the person is 
merely suffering from a weakness in 
morality or willpower,' ' Bail said. 

"It's an allergy. We alcoholics 
can't drink any alcohol or it will 
affect our lives beyond the point 
which we can control," he said. 

"An alcoholic can never have just 
that one drink. There are even 
certain types of cough medicine I 
can't take because they contain a 
small portion of alcohol, "he said. 

"Some of the stories told in 
meetings are really incredible. A 
few have gone so far as to drink 
liquid hair spray to get a high from 
alcohol," hesaid. 

It is not necessary to go to such 
extremes before seeking help. 
"Many people recognize that they 
have a problem and get help before 
things get too bad," Bail said. 

"Only the individual can deter- 
mine if (hey are an alcoholic. I could 
look at you and suspect that 
something was wrong but only you, 
down deep in your heart, can say 
thai you are an alcoholic," he said. 

Indeed, the line between theheavy 
drinker and the alcoholic is a 
crooked one. Some people are drunk 
often, or will remain sober for 
weeks, months, or years, only to go 
on a binge at some time. But these 
people are not always alcoholics. 

"I guess the line is whether or not 
you could slop if you had to. Many 
drink more lhan is healthy for them, 
but it doesn't affect their job per- 
formance or their lives. In other 
words, they can choose the time and 
place of their drunkenness, they 
retain self-control. I can't," Bail 
said. 

For someone who thinks he still 
has that control but is perhaps 
beginning to wonder, there is a test 
recommended by the National 
Council on Alcoholism. For a 
specified period of lime, at least six 
months, limit consumption to a 
certain number of drinks per day. 
The number should be no less than 
one and no more than three. Don't 
try to stop drinking all together, 
many alcoholics can do that for a 
fixed lime. 

The important thing to remember 
is lhat there are no exceptions, in- 
cluding parties, holidays or death of 
a friend or family member. 

Those who fail this test, and it only 
takes one drink over the limit, are 
recommended lo seek help.

help are: Detox center - Washington

Reign ends 



By SANDRA WILEY 

Editor-in-chief 

Summing up a year of service as 
IPFW's Student Body President isn't an 
easy task. 

But Ann Momper, who until 
yesterday served in that role, tried. "If 
I were just starting (his job with what 1 
know now, I could do moreright away," 
she said. 

It would have been easier, Momper 
said; if she had known university and 
Students' Government policies and 
procedures when starting her job. 

Not knowing these things, she said, 
caused her to proceed cautiously into 
Students' Government business. Even 
after learning the correct procedures 
and duties of her job, Momper said, 
there were other problems. "I had to 
learn how to handle volunteer help," 
she said. "I had always thought that 
bad help was better lhan no help." 
Momper now realizes this isn't true. 

She said she had some "help" who 
never contributed much to the 
Students' Government— although they 
were members. "I kepi thinking that 
someday a project would come along 
that would interest them and they'd get 
involved and do something, but some 
people jusl never did." 

She said it is difficult to tell such 
helpers to work or get out. Momper 
said, however, that she was proud of the 
things that were accomplished by 
Students' Government members during 
her one-year term. "I think we've 
strengthened Students' Government 



beyond what it once was," she said, 
"especially in SUBOG." 

She said the SUBOG is now involved 
in more than the weekly movie series; 
SUBOG activities this far included 
planned bus trips and Ihe trip to Florida 
over spring break. "We'd like to see 
some of the events become annual 
things lhat students would look forward 
lo and plan on," she said. 

Momper also had praise for members 
of the Student Senate. 

"I was pleased with Ihe effort made 
by the Senate, especially in things like 
the campaigns against the tuition in- 
creases, the late calendar and for the 
engineering degree program," she 
said. 

"These are the sort of things 
Students' Government should get into. 
It's time to get the focus off Students' 
Government and onto the issues." 

Momper, a graduate student working 
for a master's degree in public and 
environmental affairs, said that she 
will miss working in Students' 
Government but, "it's time for me to 
get on with other things." She is looking 
for a job and wants to finish her degree, 
but the past year has been important to 
her. 

"This experience has taught me so 
much about dealing with people," she 
said. And her only regret is that she 
didn'l gel into Students' Government 
sooner— as an undergraduate— so that 
she could "do more before moving on to 
other things." 




Hypnotists help fight smoking battle 



By ELLIE WOLLMAN 
Staff Writer 
Second in a series: 

Mary is a senior in college. She is 
bright, outgoing, and enthusiastic about 
life. Unfortunately for Mary, she may 
run into trouble sooner than she thinks 
... Mary is a habitual smoker, but would 
like to quit. 

The constant battle to stop smoking is 
one of the most common problems 
faced by people today, 

"Often with this particular problem, 
hypnosis can act as a trigger to start 
Ihe process of change for more positive 
behavior patterns," said Marcia 
Benjamin- Leiler, instructor of speech 
communications, at Manchester 
College, North Manchester. 

Being very involved with the use of 
hypnosis in her private practice, she 
defines this method as a relaxed state 
of mind that allows the subconscious 
(mind) to accept positive suggestions 
which often have an impact on a 
person's regular behavior. 

Benjamin-Lei ter believes that 
smoking may sometimes seem like an 
unsolvable problem for many people 
because of the dependency factor in- 
volved, but with many of her clients 
hypnosis often works where other 
methods fail. 

The hypnotist begins her work with a 
"•ew client by taking a complete case 



history. "It is essential to rule out any 
medical problems and to get an 
adequate background on how to best 
help the client," she said. 

Next, she uses a general procedure to 
allow the person to pleasantly drift into 
this "new relaxed state of mind." 

The person assumes a relaxed 
position, usually reclining, and focuses 
his or her attention on a particular 
object or place in Ihe room. "This 
focusing of atlention allows the mind to 
concentrate on only one thing," said 
Ben_iamin-Leiter. 

''The next step is to have the person 
take three deep breaths, thus allowing 
the process of relaxation lo start," she 
said. She then uses various phrases to 
relax each individual part of the per- 
son's body, and continue the process of 
clearing the mind of numerous thoughts 
and ideas. This technique is referred to 
as "progressive relaxation." 

"A floating, drowsy sensation may be 
felt throughout the body at this point," 
she said. Most of Benjamin-Leiler's 
clients express that this state of mind 
parallels the "twilight" state of sleep. 
The state where one is not quite asleep, 
but not quite awake — the edge of steep. 

A person usually reaches this point 
within fifteen minutes, at which time 
the hypnotist begins her suggestions.

focusing the person's awareness on the

Communicator 3rd 
in ICPA contest 

By KIM KUZEFF 
Managing Edilor 

The Communicator was named 
third best overall (honorable 
mention) among 10 Division II 
college newspapers that placed at 
the Indiana Collegiate Press 
Association (ICPA) convention at 
New Albany, April 10-11. 

Placing first overall in Division II, 
those college papers published less 
than daily, was The Crescent, from 
the University of Evansvtlle. The 
second place winner was The 
Trailblazer, from Vincennes 
University. 

Categories that The Com- 
municator garnered a first place win 
in included best editorial campaign, 
which was won with a series of 
editorials on "Gay Tolerance," best 
use of copy in an ad, and best 
editorial cartoon, drawn by Joe 
Bray. 

The Communicator placed second 
in best overall make-up in a single 
issue, best editorial, written by 
Debbie Cantwell, former editor-in- 
chief, best feature story, by Debbie 
Cantwell, and best feature photo, 
taken by Keith Hall. 

Besides receiving an honorable 
mention overall, The Communicator 
was also awarded honorable 
mentions in best column, by Suzanne 
Loomis, best news photo, taken by 
Larry McFadden, and the ad- 
vertising of the year award. 

Also at the ICPA convention, 
Sandra Wiley, editor-in-chief, was 
elected first vice-president, and 
John Logan, publisher of The 
Communicator, was elected a 
faculty advisor. 



physical and social consequences of 
smoking, such as heart attack and 
respiratory illness statistics and the 
idea that smoke may bother other 
people. Even that it causes a person's 
clothes and hair to smell bad. 

"I try to mention enough factual 
information so that I will hit upon 
something the person can identify 
with," said the hypnotist. 

In the next phase, suggestions stress 
the idea thai "the people are in control 
— cigarettes are not in control of 
Ihem," Benjamin-Lei ter said. Through 
positive wording, the person is allowed 
to feel that he or she is a strong, self- 
disciplined, confident individual able to 
control all aspects of their life. "I oflen 
say, 'You are now in control, rather 
than being a slave to a silly, expensive, 
and dangerous habit,'" shesaid. 

A person's imagination and the 
ability to visualize can often have a 
strong impact on the effectiveness of 
hypnosis. "I have the clients visualize 
themselves with the new change in 
behavior. The person imagines the 
positive effects of being a non-smoker," 
she said. She impresses Ihe idea that 
the person will feel refreshed and 
relaxed when waking up in the 
morning, and will have a sense of 
calmness throughout theday.

By JAMIE WISE 
Staff Writer 

Two senior engineering students 
from IPFW will make a Fort Wayne 
woman very happy at the end of this 
month. 

Through a grant from the Easter Seal 
Foundation and with the help from 
Harry Gates, associate professor of 
electronical engineering lechnology. 
Doug Fowler and Frank Gomen have 
developed an electronic phoning device 
for a woman who is paralyzed from the 
neck down. 

Fowler and Gomen credit Gates, the 
project sponsor, with providing the 
inspiration for them to lake on the 
project. They started their 
preliminary research in September 
and will have the project finished 
before the end of the semester. 

The woman is a victim of multiple 
sclerosis, a paralyzing disease that 
gradually deteriorates physical molor 
ability and control. 

"She can move her head back and 
forth and she can lalk," Fowler said, 
"but she cannot dial out." The phoning 
device which they developed operates 



patient lo "do what we do with our 
hands through an electronic switch," he 
said. 

The open-ended tube, which is placed 
close to her head, activates a switch 
when she blows into it. "This lakes the 
phoneoff the hook, "Gomen said. 

A second blow sends the signal 
through a scanner, shaped like a rec- 
tangular box. Sixleen listings appear on 
the scanner and each one correlates to 
a red dot. When Ihe desired name lights 
up, a third blow on Ihe lube stops on the 
name, triggers the automatic dialer, 
closes the circuits and puts the call 
through. The patient Ihen conducts her 
call through the speaker phone. Ihe 
final part of the system. When the 
phone call is completed, the user 
"sucks" the pneumatic tube, rather 
than blowing on it, and "puts the phone 
back on line," the twostudenlssaid. 

Before Fowler and Gomen created 
Ihe phone device, the patient could only 
try to punch a button when an incoming 
call came through, hoping to punch Ihe 
correct button with the limited use of

4-year engineering degree given green light 



By WAYNE STEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

There will be a four year 
engineering degree offered at IP- 
FW, bul it isn't quite time to pack 
the slide rules yet. 

According to Kenneth Johnson, 
chairman of the campus 
engineering department the 
remaining obstacles are money and 
faculty. 

Johnson hopes that funds will 
come from the slate legislature. 
"We will be taking a proposal to 
them soon to gel a permanent in- 



crease in the university budget," 
Johnson said. Present estimates pul 
the needed increase al about (250,000 
per year. 

Recruiling instructors may be a 
problem for Johnson. "There are 
very few qualified engineering 
doctorates out there to choose 
from," hesaid. 

"Because of these problems it is 
hard to say when we will be able to 
implcmenl Ihe program. Bul (he 
department is working on language 
to put in the nexl bulletin to show 



thai Ihe population will know that 
the degree is authorized even though 
we aren't ready with the courses," 
he added. 

Students already enrolled in 
related studies should have no 
problem transferring into the 
engineering program "Our basic 
requirements will be the same as 
always. People with the necessary 
math and sciences can transfer 
straight into (he engineering 
degree," Johnson said 

"Eventually we hope lo become 
accredited wilh the Accredalion 



Board of Engineering 
Technology (ABET) " he said. 

The accredalion process demands 
lhat (hree classes graduate from the 
program. The records of these 
students are studied by ABET to 
decide whether or not the campus 
willbeaccredited. 

Even without being accredited, 
the firsl engineering graduates from 
IPFW should have no trouble getting 
their first jobs. "There is an in- 
stitution here in town that has been 
placing non -accredited students for 
10 years," Johnson said

Sjbfcgan her term last April after winning a no-

From the beginning, however, Momper was

like Momper — they began slowly, but tame 
up to the job by the term's end. 

Bogged down for months by infighting over 
' a revised Senate constitution and a struggle 
for leadership powers, they seemed to ac- 
complish little. 

But when they finally got down to business, 
they accomplished much 

The Senate first tackled the problem ol an 
inadequate student activity fee Although the 
decision to raise the fee from $15 to S20 was 
not a popular one among students, the Senate 
voted to raise the fee — for the first time in 12 



legislative affairs committee was created. 
This standing committee is charged with 
keeping up with what is going on in the slate 
legislature, and elsewhere, and proposing 
action by the Senate on the issues 

The Senate became involved in issues 
important to the campus and its students — 
proposed increases in tuition, the possibility 
of a 4-year engineering degree here, and 
opposition to a proposed late calendar. 
Campaigns were conducted by the Senate for 
each of these issues 

SUBOG expanded its horizon beyond 
weekly movies and a yearly ski trip to plan a 
spring break trip to Florida, and it has set a 
precedent for sponsoring a greater variety of 
events to involve more students. 

In all, Students' Government has learned, 
as Momper said, to ."get the focus off 
Students' Government and onto the issues." 

We hope that the incoming officers and 
members of Students' Government take what 
the old Senate and SUBOG members have 
learned and continue to orient themselves 
more toward issues and activities that are 
important to students. 

We thank Ann Momper, Steve Westriek and 
Kathy Erlel for showing them the way.

The gruesome grind ot 
searching for a parking 
place leads one to suspect 
that it is far more dangerous 
to cruise the campus lots 
than it is to drive Coliseum 
Blvd. — in reverse! 

The risks from harried 
drivers circuiting the course 
ad nauseum in a 
progressively hypnotic slate 
arc horrendous. The driver 
needs to have one eye on the 
other moving cars and one 
eye out fornnemply space — 
with still another eye on 
pedestrians and a fourth eye 
watching the time, 
calculating all the while 
whether il will be possible to 
make lhal class or exam. It 
is a mission impossible and 
yet it is undertaken daily by 
all of us. 

Aside from the dangers or 
split concentration already 
mentioned, one must add the 
increasing frustration level 
of the driver. After cruising 
the lot for -10 minutes, which 
makes one late for an exam, 



Jelly beans, blue, red, purple, inspire creativity 



i understandable, if not 
forgivable, when a driver 
parks ina walkway. 

Of course, those walkways 
are essential for the 
pedestrian whose safely is 
more threatened than ever 
when forced to cross the lots 
elsewhere. While 1 am not 
aware of student injuries 
sustained in Ihe parking lots, 
I personally have seen some 
close calls. Too close! 

I've dubbed the campus 
lots "Via Vulture" because 
one has to hover for a 
coveted space. One 
technique that seems to 
work, though it has a slow 
, success rate, is to creep 
along watching for students 
leaving the building. A smart 
move is to track the student 
as he-she moves across the 
lot, guessing all the while 
which car is the destination 
One is, in fact, a vulture 
seeking the prey of Ihe 
parking place. 

Our parking problem 
concerns and frustrates me. 
I find it particularly 
frustrating because, afler 5 



years of commuting from 45 
miles, 1 finally moved just 2 
miles from campus only to 
discover lhat 1 still need to 
leave home almost an hour 
ahead to allow for "Vulture 
Time." 

A Commuter College 
without a Parking Garage?! 
How uneducated for an 
educational institution! II is 
difficull to understand why a 
garage was vetoed. Sure, one 
might guess money. But it is 
my understanding that for 
many years, everyonepaida 
higher parking fee in order 
to finance a garage. Instead, 
we got asphalt on Ihe lots. 

Speaking of that, how can 
a campus with such a small 
area afford to "use" 
i translate "waste") land for 
cars? If expansion con- 
tinues, where will the newest 
of our new buildings go? And 
whal about the aesthetic 
value of grass and trees? As 
for cars, let's slack'em and 
put all our vultures to rest 
before somebody really gets 
hurt.

"I love the west," said 
Kurt Luebke. "I want to live 
and work there." Luebke 
found the National Student 
Exchange iNSE) a way to 
begin realizing his dream 
while slill in school. 

As a preforestry student, 
Luebke discovered that NSE 
provides an economical 
meaas to pick up courses in 
forestry at the University of 
Monlana that are not offered 
at Purdue. 

Christina Gordon, a major 
in radio and television, was 
visiting relatives in Iowa 
when she learned of the 
excellent communication 
facilities at the University of 
Northern Iowa. As an NSE 
participant, she will be at- 
tending school there in the 
fall. 

"I want to gel out on my 
own — to have an ad- 
venture," said Alan Shupert, 
The University of North 
Carolina at Charlotte is the 
school where Shupert will be 
continuing his computer 
science program through the 
NSE program. 
The NSE program offers a 



simplified admissions 
process and assurance of 
transferred credits at a 
minimal additional expense. 
Universities and colleges in 
33 states participate in the 
exchange program. 

rPFW sophomores and 
juniors who will be exchange 
students in the fall have been 
announced by Donna 
Worthly, local coordinator of

Southern rock band 
blasts stereotypes 



By TIM BATZ 
Staff Writer 
In Jacksonville. Florida, 
there is o name synonymous 
with rock n" roll— Von Zanl. 
l*robably Uie mosl famous 
Van Zant was Ronnie, who, 
as lead singer, led Lynyrd 
Skynyrd and southern rock 
into [he national spotlight 
His two brothers, Johnny 
and Donnie, continue the 
Von Zant legacy. 

Donnie Van Zant'sact, 38 
Special, was making a 
respectable living up until 
last year, when their single 
"Kockin' into the Night" 
broke them up lo a position 
of national prominence. On 
March 27, the band backed 
Cheap Trick at the Memorial 
CoUseum. 

Now with three tunes off 
theif current LP, "Wild 
Eyejd Southen Boys," 
Climbing the charts, the 
hand prepares lo kick off the 
next: leg of its tour by 
ln'.iding a series of shows in 
Texas. 

Kqrmed in 1973 by Donnie 
Barnes iguitar-vocalsi, Van 
Zant, and Jeff Carlisi 
(guitar), the band hit the 
traditional "Knife and Gun" 
bar circuit An old interview 
with the band credits their 
name lo a song by Skynyrd, 
not Barnes tends to disagree. 
"In the beginning, there was 



thunder, rain, and this old 
house where we used to 
practice The cops in 
Jacksonville are of your 
extra redneck type One 
nigh I we were out there 
mindin' our own business 
and a lot of these particular 
cops show up and I do mean 
a lot. Thirty-eight Special is 
the caliber of the handgun 
they carry Lord knows we 
saw enough of them that 
night, "he said. 

Their first release put in a 
respectable showing, but it 
took "Rockin' into the 
Night," to obtain Ihe notice 
they wanled. "We try lo 
gauge our singles (o do 
better than the one before 
it," Carlisi said "The only 
exception to the rule was 
"Stone COId Believer" which 
did do as well as we had 
hoped "Hold on Loosely" 
(current single! is doing 
better than expected. We 
really think the big hit of[ 
this LP will be "fantasy 
Girl," he said. 

According to Barnes, 38 
Special has overcome any 
stereotyping by the label 
Southern Rock "The first 
LP led certain critics to 
lump us together in that 
category The last LP 
however had a great deal of 
forceful material, some of 
which I sang, a few rockin' 
ballads and a couple of 



Cosby fills Coliseum 



ByMIKEGEFFEN 

Chief Reporter 
Like Richard Pryor and 
Lily Tomlin, Bill Cosby is in 
thai rare class of comedians 
that makes you think. His 
style is smooth, relaxed and 
lie makes you feel as though 
you are a friend of his He 
doesn't simply go on stage 
and tell jokes, but gives you 
Ins Wry observations on life. 
His low-key style brought an 
hour of pleasure to the near 
si-ll out crowd ai pie 
Coliseum when he per- 
formed at a benefit for 
Bishop Luers High School 
Sunday night. 

Cosby was in lop form as 
lie did a stand-up, or rather 



sil-down. monologue, gelling 
in jabs on a wide range of 
topics including Fort 
Wayne's lousy air service, 
the Fort Wayne police 
department, 7-1 1 stores and 
parenting. 

The majority of Cosby's 
monologue was devoted lo 
parenting, and his thoughts 
on the subject included, 
"There is not a parent alive 
who is an atheist Having a 
kid will make you believe in 
God." "God loves jokes, and 
parents are his biggest 

One or the funniest 
moments in the monologue 
came when he told of the 
first time he met his 



daughter's boyfriends, or 
"gargoyles" as he put it. He 
doesn't just tell you his 
views, he puffs them up a bit 
lo make you see the small 
truths in life he is trying lo 
getaL 

As enjoyable as Cosby 
was, Ihe evening started on a 
sour note, The musical 
group, if I can call them thai, 
The Arbors, opened the show 
lor Cosby and almost closed 
it ai the same time. Their 
harmonies seemed lo be 
lifted from a muzak lape. 
and their personalities 
seemed like clones of Bill 
Murray's lounge singer on 
"Saturday Night Live."

tunes The new LP is more 
along the lines of the last. 

"We really see ourselves 
as comedians," added 
Carlisi winking "Out on the 
bus we had specially 
designed mirrored tables so 
we can walch our facial 
expressions and practice all 
the time." 

Unlike mosl rock acts, 
Special uses two drummers 
all Ihe time. 

"We had a choice," 
recalled Carlisi. "Add Ihe 
other drummer or lei him 
colled unemployment on our 
account We needed Ihe

added. "Normally we don't 
let Jed do an interview

handy to quiet him down. 
Seriously, two drummers 
add a sound and dimension 
you can't obtain by adding 
two of anything else. It's one 
of ihe little twists that makes 
us different " 

As our talk wound down (o 
a close, I asked Barnes and 
Carlisi if there was anything 
they wanted lo throw out (hat 
we hadn't talked aboul. 
"Normally about all we ever 
want lo throw out is our

like to throw you out," said 
Carlisi. "Sounds good lo

timely film. It exposes 

terrorism as a social 
malady, but shows that a 
person who commits such 
acts is not a purely evil 
villian. II lets the 
audience know thai in a 
world of extremes, there 
arenoslereolypes. 

The film begins will) 
two rather starliing 
scenes thai evoke a fear 
that something awful is 
about to happen, and 
although in one case it 
does, the audience is 
spared Ihe gory details 
The film is filled with 
impending threats of 
violence, a common 
occurrence nowadays, 
but it does not have the 

moviegoers have come to 
expect. II is, however. 
effective 

Sylvester Stallone and 
Billy Dee Williams 
portray New York City 
streel detectives who act 
as if they are characters 
on Ihe "Hill Streel 
Blues " They cut up with 
each other, argue with 
each other and care for 
each other. They are also 
shown to be good dops 
Their character 



development is one of the 
elements that makes this 
film work 

liutger Hauer (keep an 
eye on him) is Wulfgar 
the terrorist. Disarm- 
ingly charming, he is a 
ladies' man and a disco 
aficionado. II would be 
easy lo show Ihe an- 
lagonisl as psychopathic, 
and I'm sure thai many 
clone movies will do just 
that. But this character 
gets complicated when he 
execules Iwo "friends" 
after promising Ihey are 
going to a belter place, 
Wolfgar risks Ihe success 
of bis final hurrah when 
he releases an infant held 
with a group of hostages 
to the custody of Stallone, 
for whom he has 
developed a strange sense 
of respect. 

There are several 
things aboul this film 
which affect its con- 
tinuity. Throughout, 
Wolfgar is described as 
an international leader of 
terrorism. But he is 
shown as trying lo win the 
approval of Hammad, 
someone we never meet 
Hammad is linked with 
Persis Khambata who 
acts as an intermediary 
and partner in crime with 



Wolfgar Their 

relationship is unclear 
The implication is that 

Hammad will somehow 
profit from Ihe terror 
inflicted by Wolfgar and 
turn be Wolfgar's 



ben 



W h i I 



Wolfgar is not entirely 
motivated out of a 
fiduciary interest, lie is 
not a man of independent 
means He seems lo he a 
free lance terrorist, 
looking to attach himself 
to a rising star to finance 
his high lifestyle. 

"Nighlhawks" is billed 
as featuring the music of 
Keith Emerson; il is 
disappointing thai this is 
nol entirely correct 
There are snippets of his 
music, but never is there 
a full song. His prowess is 
used more to set Ihe 
mood, as in the chase 
scene and during the 
credits 

For all its sloppiness, 
"Nighthawks" is nol , a 
bad film. II tries (o be 
honest and doesn't exploit 
the elemenls il pulls 
together. II shows human 
beings pretty much for 
what Ihey are — victims 
of events which they 
cannot control.

Thiele teaches journalism, splits time 
between IPFW, North Side High School 



ByKAYREUSSER 
Stair Writer 

All IPFW professors are 
not alike. 

While most ot them go 
through the semester 
teaching students who are, 
on Ihe average, in their 20s, 
have jobs, and probably 
families, there are ex- 
ceptions. Norma Thiele is 
one. 

Besides teaching Mass 
Communications at IPFW, 
Thiele teaches journalism 
full-time to teenagers at 
North Side High School. 

Although many people 
might shudder at the thought 
of teaching high school 
students, Thiele gives no 
indication of any hair-raising 
experiences with them. 

Rather, she said, she finds 
"it's more challenging to 
work with high school 
students than those of 
college age," Thiele said, 
"because college-age 
students are better 
motivated and have better 
study and learning habits 
than high school students. 

"At the college age, the 
professor does not have to 




Norma Thiele

work so hard and can 
become lazy in preparing his 
lessons," she added. 

However, Thiele didn't 
always plan to teach. 

"Originally I worked at 
The Journal-Gazette as a 
reporter," she said, "but I 
got so many offers to teach 
journalism that I decided to 
take one." 

Her students here are glad 
she changed her career. 

"I can't believe how media 
conscious I've become since 
I enrolled in this class,"

remarked one student to 
another as they walked out 
after Thiele's class. "And I 
watch TV more critically, 
and I'm clipping out all sorls 
of items from newspapers 
and magazines to discuss in 

Now, after leaching 16 
years, Thiele believes there 
is no better purpose in life 
than teaching. 

"Teaching is the best there 
is," she said. Then, half 
jokingly she added, 
"Although I don't think I 
have ever gone home any 
night without having papers 
to grade." 

"But," she said smiling, 
"that doesn't mean I always 
grade them," 

When asked why she began 
teaching at IPFW, she said 
simply, "I do it because I 
think it is interesting. It 
gives me a chance to work 
with different groups and I 
feel I am a better teacher 
because of it " 

Thiele leaches Mass 
Communications because 
she believes it is important 
for students to learn to 
communicate through the 
mass media.

"By learning skills in mass 
communications, studenls 
can learn how lo improve 
themselves and how to 
govern society," she ex- 
plained. "If we cannot 
communicate together, we 
cannot exist in society; and I 
am not prepared to be 
isolated," 

Thiele believes that 
teaching is more successful 
today than it was 10 years 
ago. 

"Ten years ago I had a 
certain number of students 
in my classes for no other 
reason than (o avoid the 
draft and Vietnam," she 
remembers. "Today the 
students and professors are 
both in class for the same 
reason. This means that 
their goals are more 
parallel, and, consequently, 
the class is more 
meaningful."

Tuskers place seventh

Staff Writer 

The Tusker volleyball 
team kept itself in position to 
throw the division cham- 
pionship into a three-way tie 
with an easy win overToledo 
last Wednesday. 

If IPFW can handle 
Earlham for the fifth time 
this season, the regular- 
season finale in Chicago with 
George Williams will 
determine the two learns 
thai will represent the "non- 
power division' ' at the 
Midwest Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association 
playofisat Ohio State. 

But the Tuskers could not 
afford to look past last 
week's match against last- 
place Toledo, especially 
since they had played 
sluggishly in their earlier 
match with the first-year 
conference member. Run- 
ning off an ll-o first-set lead, 
it became apparent IPFW 
avoided that pitfall. 

Coach Arnie Ball finally 
got a chance to get his 
reserves into a match. After 
winning the first two sets, 15- 
5 and 15-8. Ball gave his subs 
their chance and they 
responded with a 15-12 
triumph. "This was the first 
opportunity we had to play 
all the kids, "he said. 

"We served real well," 
Ball said "It was probably 
the best-served match of the 
year " The coach also had 
words of praise for freshman 
attacker Chris Cole. The 6-2 
New Haven graduate 



The winning team is 
the one with the lowest 
subtotal. 

The individual scores are 
also important because they 
play a part in determining 
where a player will slarl in 
the next match, A player's 
overall average helps decide 
his standing within the team. 

Having the best preseason 
average, Randy Meltert 
started the Tuskers against 
St. Francis. He was followed 
by Steve Antrim, Ken 
Weddie. Todd Meeks and 
Kevin Music. Their scores 
were 43. 38, 40, 37 and 44 
respectively. 

On Saturday, April 11, the 
team travelled to Anderson 
for the Anderson Invitational 
where they placed seventh in 
a field of ten teams. The 
Tuskers, who had a 201 total, 
were only seven strokes 
behind the winner, Taylor 
University, who had a 194 
total. 

Antrim started the 
Tuskers across the course in 
the second meet. Mettert, 
Meeks. Weddie. Music, and 
Keith Prine followed in that 
order. Their scores were 41, 
37, 40. 41, 42 and 43 respec- 
tively. (Prine's score being 
the highest it was dropped. I 

The Tuskers, under the 
direction of coach Ken Work- 
man, will travel to Man- 
chester today for a 
triangular meet with 
Manchester and Goshen. 




Chris Cole goes up for the spike during the Tuskers' 
volleyball game against Toledo on April B. The Tuskers won 
three straight sets: 15-5, 15-8, and 15-12. 
"played by far his best 
match of the year," he said. 
Cole had little organized 



volleyball experience and 
"really had to jump right 
into the big lime Ihis year,'' 
Ball added. 

IPFW will host Kellogg 
Community College Friday 
in an in terdi visional match. 
Kellogg, winner of the 
"power division" last year, 
defeated the Tuskers earlier 
in a straight-set match in 
Grand Rapids, Mich. Fort 
Wayne Bible College, a club 
learn, will attempt to avenge 
an earlier loss to IPFW 
Wednesday at the Concordia 
Seminary gym. 

In other division matches, 
Cincinnati dumped Earlham 
to stay tied with IPFW for 
second. The Tuskers control 
Cincinnati's destiny, so to 
speak, since IPFW must 
beat division-leading George 
Williams in order for the 
Bearcats to get a piece of the 
division crown. 

If that happens 



plicated tie-breaking for- 
mula will determine which 
two teams go to the playoffs. 
The three learns will have 
split their matches with each 
other, so that part of the 
formula is of no help. Total 
games, or sets, won in 
divisional play is the next 
criteria for the lie-breaking 
procedures. There are 
provisions, of course, if this 
does not relieve the logjam, 
but after thai it gets so 
complex that even coach 
Ball admits he isn't sure 
what will happen. 

However, matters are 
simplified if IPFW loses. 
George Williams wins the 
title. Cincinnati finishes 
second and also goes to the 
playoffs. And IPFW stays 
home and looks forward to 
next year when it could have 
all of its players back and the 
makings of a good recruiting 
class. Period. Well, actually 
Toledo or Earlham could 
complicate things by up- 
setting one of the leaders... 



Komets hopeful 

BvMlKEFRANKR on ItlP mailer "We ImI 9 fan J!=—,_ 1 _J .u„ 



IvMlKEFRANKE 
Chief reporter 

The Fort Wayne Komets 
began this season as if there 
were no tomorrow. They won 
game after game and it 
became a routine ac- 
complishment lo go out and 
wia Intimidation of Ihe 
opposition was evident. 

Then came the new year, 
and the loss of that early 
season sharpness that had 
held them atop the Inter- 
national Hockey League As 
a matter of fact the learn fell 
flat on ils face, losing and 
tying games al a head- 
spinning pace. 

The club 1-st its hold on 
first place lo the Kalamazoo 
K-Wings by the end of 
January 

By ihe season's end, April 
5, the Komels had fallen into 
third place in the overall 
I ILL. standings, behind 
Kalamazoo and Saginaw 
This forced the Komels lo 
open up the playoffs with the 
Milwaukee Admirals. 

What was the cause of Ihe 
Komel collapse? "We lost a 
/ew games and started to 
press loo hard. Before you 
knew it. we were in Ihe midst 
of a slump," said veteran 
'goalie Robbie Irons. 

Rookie winger Dale 
Baldwin had some thoughts 



.-.. "We lost a few 
players and it was rough 
getting acquainted with the 
new acquisitions so late in 
the season." he explained. 

The International Hockey 
League is a developmental 
league that feeds players to 
other affiliated teams in 
higher grade leagues, such 
as the American Hockey 
League and the Central 
Hockey League. The Komets 
had their share of player 
departures. 

The Komels have losl 
three defensemen at dif- 
ferent bmes in the season to 
the Central League, two of 
whom never returned to Fort 
Wayne, Greg Kostenko and 
Kelly Elcomhe. Two for- 
wards. Glenn Tomalty and 
Rod Willard, had been 
recalled during the season, 
but a Her lengthy stays Ihey 
finally returned. 

Al Oumba, last year's 
Most Valuable Player, left 
the club in November for 
"personal" reasons, and 
veteran Dave Norris was 
dropped from the squad in

concept that was established 
in the early season, and their 
performance during Ihe 
second half of the season 
points that fact out. 

Going into the playoff 
opener with Milwaukee, Ihe 
Komets were nothing more 
than a confused and 
frustrated team. Somehow 
they pulled out a 5-1 opening 
game victory in overtime 
when newcomer Brant 
Kiessig lei the lamp three 
minutes into the extra 
stanza. 

The following night in 
Milwaukee, the club was 
soundly beaten, 8-4, as the 
Admirals jumped out to a 3-0 
lead midway through the 
first period. 

Saturday night at the 
Coliseum, the Komets 
played very well en route lo 
a 4-3 hardnosed victory over 
Milwaukee, to take a two-to- 
one advantage in the besl-of- 
seven series. 

Despite the season long 
disruptions, the club feels it 
can still be a threat in the 
playoffs. "We can still go all 
the way and win this thing," 
said Irons.

Tuskers cruise to easy 
win over rival Cougars 



ByMIKEFRANKE 
Chief Reporter 

A week of rained out 
baseball games ended 
Sunday, as the Tuskers 
played only one of three 
scheduleddoubleheaders. 

Last Tuesday, IPFW 
swept a pair from Saint 
Francis. In the opener, Ron 
Dull had three hits lo lead 
the Tuskers to an 8-4 vic- 
tory. 

IPFW scored in each of the 



first five innings and 
cruised to the win from 
there. 

The second game was won 
by the Tuskers 13-6. as Mike 
Hollowell hit a grand slam 
which busted the game wide 
open. Doug Grover 
also homered for IPFW, his 
second round tripper of the 
season. 

Rick Stevens, struck out 
six of eight batters that he 



faced in an impressive relief 
stint, which earned him a 
save in the nightcap. Stevens 
also picked up a save in the 
opener as the lefthander 
seems to be in top form after 
a shaky start. 

IPFW plays Goshen on 
Thursday and I.U.P.U.I. will 
visit the Tuskers Friday in a 
makeup doubleheader. 
Wabash will provide the 
opposition on Saturday.

The men's tennis team 
began ils season on a sour 
note with two tough matches 
last weekend. 

The first match was 
against a superior Siena 
Heights, Michigan team, and 
the second against Cedar- 
ville College in Cedarville, 
Ohio. According to tennis 
coach Ben Becker, Cedar- 
ville has won its division title 
for the past 12 years. 

Siena Heights downed the 
Tuskers 9-0 as did Cedar- 
ville. In the singles matches 
againsl Cedarville, Holden 
Maecker was downed 6-3 and 
6-2 ; Russ Carroll losl 6-3 and 
6-3; Tim Young was defeated 
6-1 and 6-3; Chris Braun lost 
his first set 6-3, won the 
second set 4-6, and dropped 
the last set 6-3; Roger Salud 
losl 6-3 and 6-1; and Kevin 
Smith was defealed 6-0 and 6- 
0. 

IPFW was also over- 
powered in the doubles 
matches. Maecker and 
Carroll lost, 6-2 and 6-2; 



Salud and Paul Grider were 
downed 6-2 and 7-5; and 
Smith and Tim Martin were 
outplayed 6-0 and 6-1, 

Becker attributed the 
team's difficulty with the 
first couple of matches to 
several points. One is that 
most of the teams par- 
ticipate in a preseason 
program in the South. He 
hopes that in the future 
IPFW can attend the mat- 
ches, but at present the 
funding is just not there. 

Many of the schools offer 
scholarships to tennis 
players to get the "big-time" 
stars; IPFW does not. And 
most of the teams IPFW 
meets are from resident 
schools where the par- 
ticipation is greater than at 
IPFW. 

Weather has also been a 
big factor. With all the 
recent rain, the team has 
difficulty in practicing. 

Becker is nappy wilh how 
the team is playing. "Braun 
played the best games of his 
career, and they are all 
improving,"hesaid.

Women's team 
sets six new 
school records 



ByTIMOTHYJ.ROSS 
Sports Edilor 

The women's track team 
opened its season with a 
triangular meet at Man- 
chester College on a windy 
and rainy April 11. The 
Tuskers left Manchester 
with second place and six 
new school records. 

The women accumulated 
121 points, which was not 
enough to best their host's 
279 points. But it was enough 
to beat the third member of 
the triangle, Tri-State who 
had 67 points. 

"We did very well for our 
first meet of the season, 
despite the windy and rainy 
conditions. It was a very 
positive meet for us — it's 
nice to begin a season with 
Ihis kind of meet," said 
women's track coach Peggy 
Voison. 

According to Voison, Ihis is 
the first time an IPFW 
women's track team has 
scored above 100 points in a 
meet. 

The meet was productive 
in another aspect as well. 
Seven members of the team 
set new school records in six 
different events. 

Freshman Jill Thiele 
carried home two first place 
ribbons and now holds a 
school record in the 1500 
meter run and the 3000 meter 
run. Her times were 5:27.5 
and 11:50.6 respectively. 

Thiele also anchored the 
1600 meter relay team that 
placed second in Ihe meet 
and set a new IPFW record 
at4:57.7 The other members 



of Ihe relay squad in the 
order they ran were Linda 
Przeniczny. Jeanne Meyers, 
and Tammy Houser. 

Freshman Krisle Hoffman 
also set two new records in 
the competition. In Ihe high 
jump, she placed third with a 
jump of 4'llli", and in the 
long jump, she placed second 
with a jump of 157". 

Freshman Kathleen Smith 
set a new record in (he discus 
throw. She tossed the discus 
117*1". 

Freshman Linda 

Przeniczny added to the 
Tuskers' score by placing 
first in the 100 meter dash 
and Ihe 200 meter dash. She 
breezed the 100 meter in 12.9 
seconds, just four-tenths of a 
second from qualifying for 
the Association for Inler-
