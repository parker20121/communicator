'1 took over because the current chair 
sskod me if 1 would." Life said.

job a chance, because be has said con- 
tinually, tbat be would never take Ibis

theatre, working with the faculty in 
developing a curriculum, counseling 
students, and "probably a whole bunch 
of other stuff that I haven't discovered," 
Life said. 'It is bard to know what the

"I couldn't give up directing, thai 
would be like cutting off my arm," Life 
said, "Directing a play and managing a 
deparUncnl is a lot of work, ask me 
again in a year if I Like it." 

Life explained tbe importance in main- 
taing a healthy relationship with bis ctu- 

"I want to make sure that I continue to 
be accessible to students, because I 
have a good working relationship with 
students now. and I wouldn't warn to 
lose thsi connection." Life said. 

Life's career in theatre began when be 
was seven years old. 

"I can't remember a time in my life 
when I wanted lo do anything else," 
Life said. 

His parents enrolled him in a profes- 
sional school to give him something to 
do after school because they worked 
and acting is all tbat be ever did. 

"1 have to enjoy what it is that I am

Diversity issue still unaddressed 



Has IPFW addressed 
minority retention? 

By Ramona Mcgown 
Chief Reporter 

The issue of diversity has taken on 
several different meanings for profes- 
sors and administraiors. 

Some campuses have tried to lake 
actions to insure that tbey are providing 
an atmosphere thai is conducive to the 
students that are attending the campus. 

One of IPFWs professors expressed 
bow be felt TPFVJ was choosing to deal 
the issue of diversity. 

"This university is filled with preju- 
dice and bigoted persons. For those pro- 
fessors and faculty who wish lo grow 
inlellectually and share ideals with oth- 



ers, they will not be able lo accomplish 
either of these goals if they are looking 
lo IPPW," said Omowala-Ketu 
OladowB, associate professor in jour- 
nalism. 
On campuses throughout the country, 
divetsiiy still remains an issue that con- 
cerns faculty, students, and administra- 

Many colleges are still in need of 
recruitment and sensitivity programs for 
students and a higher retention rate of 
both minority faculty and students. 

According to Prank Borelli. vice chan- 
cellor of student affairs, in a student 
forum held in November, he staled that 
the retention of regular students at 
IPFW was about 60%. 

However, the retention rate of 
African- Americans on this c 



55%- 

IPFW has afpronimately 450 African- 
American students. 

BottUi slated Ihai bis office is looking 
Bl the problem and is trying to deter- 
mine why the retention of African- 
Americans is so high. 

lim Julian, a professor of sociology, 
had this to£ay about the diversity issue 
on campus. 

"Although I haven't been at the uni- 
versity for a long period of time, I 
would suggest more interaction 
between the campus and the surround- 
ing cornmunily, creoting a more unified 
and ethnically conscious environment," 
sold Julian. 

Bctly Poignard, director of multicul- 
tural services, did not wish lo comment 
on Ihe divcnity issue.

Staff Editorial 

Should the administration 
consider student input? 



"// appears to The Communicator that IPFW stu- 
dents have decided that they have no rights (not 
including Mark Snyder, of course), so it would be 
worthless to try to stand up for them. " 



The last several ediiorials The 
Communicator has published have 
discussed how education offects IPFW 
students dtrecily. This is yet another 
one in the scries to inducncc students 
to take a stand Tor their own righls. 
The recent changes in the Theatre 
Department presents one of the most 
important questions that needs lo be 
answered by the administration: 
Should students have a voice in 
administrative decisions within their 
respcelive schools? 
We, the staff of the Communicator, 
cry out an ever important, YES. 
Ii appears to The Communicator thai 
IPFW students have decided that Ihcy 
have no righls (not including Mark 
Snyder, of course), so it would be 
worthless lo tiy to stand up for them. 
Do students enjoy other people mak- 
ing decisions for them? 
This week's editorial canoon depicts 
what The Communicator thinks the 
average student is feeling when any 
issue is concerning their input on the 
changes in any aspect of (his universi- 
ty 

Why did only one student write let- 
ters concerning Neil Labute's contract 
not being renewed? 
If more than one student wasn't con- 
cented, why didn't they write letters 
addressing the issue? 
Maybe students were intiinidaicd by 
putting their name in a paper which 
could invite public criticism. 
Sure, The Communicator serves as a 
sounding board for students to present 
their opinions on issues of campus, 
but with no leOei^ bow do they expect 
the administration lo know how Itacy 
feel. 

If the Administration does not know 
what the problem is. how can ihey 
begin to solve it? 

Admittedly, it would lake more Ihan 
one student lo say that their is a prob- 



lem, bul wilhoul YOUR input, we 
can'l have a successful Univenity. 
Don't students at this University 

Isn't it time for the students lo speak 
up? (Somebody besides Mark 
Snyder!) 

We all have great ideas that can be 
put to good use. Haven't you ever 
heard of Ihc phrase. "Just say no?" 

The "Just say no" campaign was 
started to influence children lo t&gt;e1ieve 
in themselves and not give into peer 
pressure to take drugs. 

Wc do not live in o country ihat is 
run by communists. Without your 
voice. Ihe administraton. faculty and 
siaff cannot know what changes you 
want or do not wont 

Wfaal is the solution to getting more 
student input on this campus? 

The administration needs to moke a 
more strenuous effort by welcoming 
the student input, not Just fmm student 
government, but from all students, eh? 

One way to do this is by issuing a 
campus survey on how students feel? 
Are Ibey enjoying iheir education here 
at IPPiV? Maybe after domg another 
survey that will fonn a consensus of 
the whole campus. Frank Borclli, 
vice-&lt;hanccllor of student affairs, will 
somehow understand why IPFW loses 
aboul 55 % of their minority students 
and 609t of Ibeir regular student body. 

Or maybe why there is a desperate 
need for child can on this campus? 

Just because we are students does not 
mean that we don't know what we 
want oui of school. 

We want a great education, but we 
also warn to be acknowledged not tol- 
erated as the admmistration seems to 
appear to do. The only way we can do 
this is by cnlleciively making our con- 
cerns known through venues such as 
our student government and The

You didn't hear it from me, but... 




Hey ya. folks! How are you doing? 
Me? Just nnc. I thought I would fmish 
off the year by writing to you all. It's 
been a great lime writing, Vou didn't 
hear U from me. but . . . And don'i 
worry I will be writing this colunm nexi 
year for all of you. Hopefully, next year 
I will have some really good gossip. 
Let's review the year for what it was. 
Well, wc all know thai the chancellor 
is leaving, so nest year we will have to 
look forward lo having a new person 
lake over. Who will it be? 
Whal about IPFW's hiring of John 
Taylor, the music deparlment chair, 
who bos been accused of sexual hamss- 
menl charges against two professors at 
bis former university, Tennessee 
Technological University? 
I think after all of the articles that The 
Communicator has printed, the people 
Ihat hired him at IPFW are really kick- 
ing themselves in the ass over why they 
hired him. I think that if the case does 
go to federal court as il should, and he 
is found guilty, IPFW is going to be a 
hectic place to be. And I hope I'm here 
to repon on all of the gossip that will be 
going around. 



What about the theatre department and 
all of its little rumblings? The fabulous 
production of Hair thai had all of that 
nudity. Labute's contract not being 
renewed, Satratore stepping down from 
his position, and Larry Lite becoming 
the new chair. My, how quickly things | 
change! 

Or Mark Snyder 
succumbing lo the 
changes in the the- 
atre department. 
He's not the Snyder 
of the old days, but 
I'm sure he'll be 
back next year with 
more to say. I'd 
hate to see a head- 
line; "Snyder 
becomes speech- 
less!" in Ihe paper 

Like I said before, 
and I'll say it again. 
Ibis isn't ihe only 
deparlmenl that is 
going to have 
changes. Look to the edi 

Walch one of the departments that is 
in the building located directly across 
from Helmke Library. 




I ain't one to talk. 

It looks like the in thing to do is work 
at Hie Communicator and then move 
on over lo Ibe Student Senate. If you 
don't believe me, look at the chair of 
the Campus Organizations and Vice 
president of legislation, former staff 
members, eh? 



has it that Rajat 
Suri is considering 
not running for stu- 
dent body president 
next semester. 
Well. Raj. who art 
we going to have to 
really speak up for 
the students? If it 
ain't broke, why 
break it now? So, I 
will publicly take

The Communicator went into in' house

paper in Ihe office. What a great 
achievement to accomplish! And I am 
sure the newspaper will do great things 
in.the new year to come! 

Let's not forget that the Student Art 
League is selling their works, I think it 
is a worthy cause, so please go over and 
help out the art students. It's for a good 

Next we will be celebrating IPFW's 
own personal holiday, the Semi-Annual 
Bomb Threat Week which we celebrate 
during the fmsLs week of both the fall 
and spring semester. This is the week 
when every time a student lums around, 
there is a police officer coming to the 
door telling them there is a fire alarm. 

However, the police officer's don't 
find it too funny, I think you need to 
realize though, for you bomb threat 
callers, thai whenever you call a bomb 
threat, Ihose students have to slay out- 
side of the building for at least an hour 
until they can re-enter the building. So, 
think before you call. 

Well, that's oU I have to say, you have

Student concemetd about race 



1 took an evening off from work on Nov 
10 to allend a presentation by Professor 
Snidennan ai the IPFW campus with my 
granddaughter. We both allend college 
there and were expecting to hear some 
new infoimalioo. The lecture was titles, 
'The New Politics of Race," Being a pro- 
fessor in the field of pohtical science, I 
was expecting lo learn new evidence 
which might be helpful in solving the 
mcial dilemma that exists in our country 
today, I was disappointed by whal I 

First. I am aware thai anger and resent- 
ment have been involved in racism for a 
long time. No mention was made of who 
perpetuates this, or who benefits from 
racism. Next, Dr. Snidcrman staled that 
an e&lt;)ual number of people can be influ- 
enced 10 change iheir mcial views from 
either way, from more prejudice to less, 
or from less prejudice to more. This was 
very unreassuring. To mo it shows that 
the number of people ignorant of racial 
relations are still in Ihe majority. They 
have no intention of finding out more to 
reUevo this ignorance. It shows Ihal peo- 
ple can be easily swayed to the views of 
Ihe interviewer when ihey know Utile or 
nothing about a subject. 

As professor Snidermon slated, ibe 
more knowledgeable aboul pohtics a per- 
son is. the less likely he or she will have 
anger in that person. So loo with race 
relations, although Ihis country is known 
for the passion with which people 
respond to raaal questions with veiy Ut- 
ile reason tied lo them, 

1 become particularly concerned when 
ho sUled that the rhetoric of the dO's was 



inclusive, Ihen politics changed with 
Martin Luther King. Barry Washington, 
and Forrakhan when ii gave way to divi- 
sivencss. To me, these men were trying 
to empower blacks to have pride and 
more self reliance, sorry if Ihis seems 
divisive to whites. 1 feci that Reagan's 
trickle-down policies which dismantled 
progrums set up to help people out of 
poverty were divisive, Administralots 
helped themselves lo profits, creamed the 
programs of money and gave hcense lo 
the wealthy to take much and give little 
hack to the govemmcni through his poli- 
tics. It allowed companies to close up 
shops and leave Ihe country, putting 
thousands on the unemployment lines 
and hundreds more into the streets of our 
cities. What is more divisive Ihan Ihat! 

Students quesboning Dr. Sniderman on 
his statement (hat higher education being 
less prejudiced were wilhin their righls lo 
do so. He raised Ihc issue and if he didn'l 
lack the insight to see that Ihere is prob- 
lem in higher education, be would have 
not been so defensive. The people criti- 
cizing the siudenij must lack this type of 
insight. I don't see where Ihey were com- 
paring apples or oranges. What is wrong 
wilh questioning leseaichcr's work! 
Because a person holds a doctorale 
degree shouldn't mean he or she is above 
criticism, or questioning If we're to lake

Instructor concerned about childcare 



To the Ediior. 

There are 12.000 students who attend 
IPPW which makei ii ihc fifth largest 
uiiivenily in Indiano. Of these, 42 per- 
cent ore between the ages of 26 nnd SO. 
Almost 60 pen:ent of the studentE are 
femalE, two-ihiids are single and the 
largest enrollment is among pnii-tune 
feinalcs who account for 25 percent of 
the lolol errolImenL 

IPFW is a commuter campus with the 
idea that it supposedly serves (he com^ 
munity and surrounding areas in which 
it is located; it ts not generally viewed 
u a campus sought after by students 
outside of the city and surrounding 

Given the cnroUment dain and that this 
is a commuter campus, one can spccu* 
late that IPFW has a high ratio of single 



moiherr who ivork and could use the 
services of an on-campus child core 
facility. 

Such a taeihty would also strcnglhcD 
(be idea that IPFW has long beta trying 
to promote even from its eorhest history 
— thai of being and educational institu- 
tion of higher learning for mature 
adults, and one that server the commu- 

I know that the quick answer would be 
that some of IPFW simply does not 
have the space. And some within the 
university would want us to believe that 
the problem is one not really as 
dcmafiding as one might lead. Yet the 
center for women's studies and continu- 
ing adult education saw it necfissary — 
perhaps as a university attempt to 
absolve itself from dealing with the 
problem — to scatter signs all across 



the campus in bright bold colors 
reminding mothers that CHILDREN 
SHOULD NEVER BE LEFT UNSU- 
PERVISED, Was this the university's 
answer to the problem? Mothers know 
they should not leave their children 
unsupervised. And when they must, can 
you imagine their concern and fears of 
leaving them even in the seemingly 
friendly halls of IPFW? The signs can 
only serve to make these mothers who 
must bring their children, feel guilty. 
Tic signs aiE not a solution. And tbey 
do little to promote tbe idea that IPFW 
is not only a university, but it is an edu- 
cational facility thai addresses the needs 
of its largely older adult student enroll-

Betty Tonsing 



Students make proposal for dorms 



Dear Editor. 

Picture younelf as o college student, 
having five or more hours between two 
classes. Did you ever wonder what the 
commuting students on this campus do 
when they have these large gaps in their 
schedule? Tbe feci is that 27'it 

commute to IPFW from outside of the 
Allen County area. Even driving from 
the opposite side of town could take 30 
minutes to arrive on campus. Can you 
imagine the tiresome drive for those liv. 
ing outside Allen County? In normal 
conditions this drive is still inconve- 
nient, but with road bozonls such as ice. 
snow, construction, and accidents, the 
drive is even more difficult. Then, of 
course, they must make atiother trip to 
campus for their later class. A lot of 
studying could be done during the time 
spent driving. We are presenting this 
proposal because of the coticetn we have 
about the welfare of tbe cotnmuting stu- 
dent. 

We have a suggestion to this driving 
dilemma for long - distance commuters 
who seek a quiet atmosphere: temporary 
dorm facilities. Trams, similar to trailers, 
could be instaUed on campus cofltaioing 
these temporary dorais. The trams are 
designed with a scnatl hallway down tbe 
middle, with S or 6 rooms branching off 
both sides. These rooms would be small 
but could each have a desk, if tbey need 
to study, a single bed if tbey would like 
to sleep, and an alarm clock tbey could 
set to wake UiemseLves up at the appro- 
priate hme. One of our own psychology

professors lectures on bow studying in 
the same environment that you learn, 
increases your memory of the material. 
Why aren't other facihiies, such as the 
library appropriate? We feel, as many 
students do, that the people, and their 
actions of merely walking past are much 
too distracting. It is very difficult to con- 
1 people around you. The 
donns would give students a chance to 
study or even sleep within seclusion, and 
would encourage students ' 
campus. Privacy would be maintained 
within the dorm by

person would be allowed in each 
Student who wish to participate in group 
activities could not do so at any other 
facility on campus. To make sure that 
students are not using the r(X)m for long 
periods of time, there could also be a 
time limit of an hour and a half to two 
hours, this way other students could 
have the opportunity to make use of 
them. The dorcns would be beneficial to 
tbe students, although . there would not 
be an obligation on them to use these 
dorms. Having up to twelve 
tram, if three were insloiled ' 
space in campus, we could have 36 tem- 
porary dorms to accommodate our stu- 

Tbe numb*r of on - campus ji&gt;bs would 
increase for those who are involved in 
college work - study programs. Ha\ing 



these rooms would mean hiring atten- 
dants to rent oui the rooms and janitors 
to clean them. The attendants would 
schedule the time slots and supervise all 
activities within tbe building to maintain 
order. For a student to use these faciU- 
bes, they would need to schedule a small 
fee when tbey schedule their lime need- 
ed. Tbe fee would be inexpensive, 
money is not in abundanct 
lege students, but would be based on the 
time tbey have been scheduled to use. 
the furnishings provided, trams that arc 
installed, and the wages of the work ■ 
study students. 
We feel that our temporary dorm pro- 
posal would be exceptionally ideal for 

I students , and a 
to our school. It's also a way this institu- 
tion could show concern for the students 
out of the Fort Wayne 
imporary dorms would 
lent life on campus 
Therefore, IPFW would be comparable i 
to larger nonresidential campuses, i

Thanksgiving v 



right after the Gulf War ended, sending 
unemployment rales up and general 
spirits down. Families struggled to pay 
the official kickoff grocery bills and understond why the 



t Christmas 

gift giving that will stay on our minds 
until New Year's Eve. 

With the season here, I'd like to take 
this time to reflect on all that we have 
to be thankful for. There have twen so 
many changes in the lives of Americans 
in the last few years, that we often lose 
touch of the things that we do have to 
be gratefiil for. 

A "new worid order'' is taking shape, like we had 
It began with the fall of the Berlin Wall absortied it 
and Communism You could buy a 
piece of the Berlin Wall in any depart- 
ment store for anywhere from five to 
fifty dollars. 

We've seen war. For many of us, it 
wasn't the first lime. Operation Desert 
Storm hit the nation with force during 
the winter of 1991. My parents, remem- 
bering Vietnam, held their breath. My 
brother went to protect those in Saudi 
Arabia and for seven months we had to 






call 



Thi 



!Cks to know if he was alive. The 
untry waited and watched arkd prayed 
Ih a frenzy of emotions that bad 
ver been felt before. 

re were other wars, however, that 
e fought nght here. The L.A, riots 
amc a symbol for tbe violence, 
al strife, and gang wars that have 
ivaged the nation's cities, claiming 
everyday. A 



American dream simply v 
ing anymore. Doctors battle AIDS, now 
an epidemic. The issues of gay rights 
and family values took the limelight in 
the 1992 presidential election, pitting 
Don Quayle against single mothers and 
promoting age old civil rights questions 
to resurface. Hurricane Andrew tore 
apart south Florida. California broke 
out with forest fires, leaving dcvostaiion 
like we had never seen. My young eyes 
television, through Peter 
Jennings, Tom Brokaw, or Don Rather. 

Now we're waiting, and living our 
lives. Bill Clinton is our new President, 
and be has already hflcd the gag rule on 
abortions, the ban on homosexuals in 
the military, and bos passed the Brady 
Bill and enacted a North American Free 
Trade Agreement that will go into 
effect soon. His education plan is wail- 
ing in the wings while national health 
care is debated. But m ibe be ginning. the 
public sensation was Hillary. Never 
before hos a Firsl Lady publicly played 
such a prominent role in the White 
House. Chnton has named her to sit in 
on cabinet meetings and bead his health 
care committee. Could this be. 
SHOULD this be a poliUcal and socio! 
break for women of our lime? 

These events barely scratch the surface 
of the time some of you may remember. 



the high tuitioi 
could successfully encourage o 
muling students to spend their ei 
time between classes wisely.

Theatre Review 

Thesis project reflects 
views of society 

[CQiitcFimanI

By F. Lwie Douse 
Editor In chJef 

I ihink most people go into plays to 
escape from tbeir own personal day to 
day reality. Plays are vehicles for p)co- 
ple to explore, and sometimes meet 
new people and dilTereot worlds creat- 
ed by the author. 

Kira L. Downey, an IPFW senior 
majoring in tfaeatre. diivcled tbe play. 
"Dutchman." by LeRoi James (Imamu 
Amiri Baiake), as ber senior thesis 
projecl, Downey also staned in ot»e of 
the leading roles. Lulu. 

Colby Glen Prough played the role 
of Clay, an African -Araerican man. 

Once again I was impressed by the 
creation of a subway. It was created 
by standing four poles straight up in 
the air, to fonn a square pattern and 
subway type seats were nailed to tbe 
floor. Along with the CKceUent sound 
effects, I felt as if I was actually in a 
subway with the loud sound of it pass- 
ing through d^e tunnels. 

I felt as if Downey and Prough never 
really coimected to well. There was no 
energy whatsoever flowing between 
these two competent actors throughout 
the entire production. I could not 



undersloitd why I felt this way until I 
did some self- analysis, 

1 realized because of the non-tradi- 
tional casdng. I was concentiating too 
much on figuring out who was playing 
wbaL Then I realized I didn't feel any 
energy flow between tbem because of 
tbe dead energy thai Hows between 
whites at)d African -Americans in this 
country. After acknowledging that, 1 
began to see the play in a toiaUy dif- 
ferent hghL This play began to show 
me how it is a reflection of our society 
that continues to use the old stereo- 
types into defining a group of people. 
It also dcmoosDrates how some whiles 
in the world have yet begun to under- 
stand die struggle of black folk in the 
United Stales. 

I thought an cucelleni point made by 
Clay was that African- Americans real- 
ly would not have all of this tension if 
they would just kill the people who 
are actually causing all of the prob- 
lems. Instead of killing their opprcs 
sors. African -Americans focused their 
negative feelings through their music 
and writing, venting their frustrations 
of living in a world that caters only to

Part One 

'Twas ihe night before Christmas and all through the casa, 

Not a creature was stitring. Caramba! Que pasa? 

Los ninos were all tucked away in their camas, 

Some in long underwear, some in pajamas. 

While mama worked late in her little cocina, 

El Viejo was down at the comer cantina 

Living it up with amigos. Carracho! 

Muy contento and poco borracho! 

While hanging the stockings with mucho cuidado, 
In hopes that old Santa would feel obligado 

To bring all the children, both buenos and malos, 

A nice batch of dutces and other regalos. 

Outside in the yard there arose such a grito 

That 1 jumped to my feet like a frightened cabrito. 



I ran to the window and looked out fuera, 
And who in the world do you think thai ii era; 
St. Nick in a sleigh and a big red sombrero 
Came dashing along like a crazy bombero! 
And pulling his sleigh, instead of venados. 
Were eight little burros, approaching volados. 



Panda-monium 

Zoo displays bears for holidays 





P prt Two 

I watched as they came, and this quaint little hombre 
Was shouting and whistling and calling by nombre: 

"yl&gt;, Pancko! Ay, Pepe! Ay, Cuca! Ay, Bato! 
"Ay, Chalo! Ay, Chopo! Maruca y Nieto!" 

Then standing erect with his hand on his pecho, 

He flew to the top of our very own techo. 

With his round little belly like a bowl of jalea, 

He struggle to squeeze down our old chimenea. 

TT\en huffing and puffing, at last in our sala. 

With soot smeared all over his red suit de gala, 

He filled all the stockings with lovely regalos, 

For none of the ninos had been very malos. 

Then, chuckling aloud, seeming very contento. 

He turned like a flash and was gone like the viento. 

And I heard him exclaim — and this is verdad — 

"Merry Christmas to all! Feliz Navidad! " 

"Felices Vacaciones 

y 

"Prospero ano neuvo a todos! "

Edwards is back 

1993-94 Campaign shows promise through 
experience 



Aaron N. Tbompsan 
Sporli Editor 

In IbS Kiuon'j campaign, spcctolon had 
the ofpjrlunity to wMch an almosi lOaiiy 
diTFereal womca'a baikelboU icom grace 
the hardwood when compand to Ihc pii:~ 

NCAA touraament. Thjs wm a yeat for 
coach Eileen KleiDfeltet lo alart Trom 
■cratch mainly due lo a pre'season lo» of 
itafhir Edwards. 

But little did Edwardi know at Ihe time 
thai her icam would tejpond very weD lo 
iMi loss. In fact, the uppaclassmcn oflhis 
group improved Ihemselves in almost 
every facet of the gome, whJc a lu^jriie 
WBi in order with frcstinian Lindy Jones 
garnering the GLVC Newcomer of the 
year. T^e Lady Dogs gained Ions of expo- 
lieoce over the course of the year and 
have made much improvement lo show 
for ii- This year's team shows promise as 
il letums all five of it's st&amp;nen plus Ihe 
anCicipaled return of Bdwaids to the line- 
up. With all of Ihis experience and 
piDtnite. the Lady Dons have very high 
cxpectatioat for IMt tcasaa. 

Thji team should be very evenly rounded 
thii year, but it is poitculady ai the for- 
ward and center podcion thai other leatni 
SIC going to be given fils. No longer do 
the Lady Dons have to find a way lo play 
without Edwards, who averaged 16.7 
pobts and 9.7 rebounds in the 1991-9: 
campaign. Before last eeoson, disaster 
intervened as Edwards ruptured her 
Achilles Icndon, and she wiu sidelined the 
entire year. However, ifler the year layoff. 
Edwards is fully ready lo play and has 
been selected as a pre-season Alt- 
American. 

Joining Edwards in the ftontcouit are 
two seniors who gained a lot of playing 
expetience in ber absence. These two are 
Kim Recker and Michelle Conley. Recker, 
in a slamng position last season, avenged 
12.B points per conleit and 6.D lebounds. 
which were personal career highs tor the 



5-11 senior. Conley. who probably bene- 
filed most from absence of Edwards, 
moved into Ibe slatting lineup and aver- 
aged 11.4 points and 6.5 boards. For 
Cbnley. theie were alio career highs. 

Dawn Dressier, alter her very impressive 
junior year, will return as a senior starter 
Tlie 5-9 senior averaged 11.4 points and 
led Ihe team with 7.2 rebounds a game. 
The Lady Dons are hoping Ihal Dressier 
can duplicate last season's attack, which 
helped Dressier receive Honorable 
Mention All-GLVC honors. 

Also entering the lineup for the Lady 
Dons will be sophomore sensation lennie 
Newhard, who played very well during 
her frtshman year, Newhard averaged 9.1 
points per contest and 5 3 rebounds per 
conlest. The team is hoping Ihat Newhard 
can continue io improve on ber already 
impressive statistics. 

The newcomers this year appear lo have 
a lot of talent. MoeI notable is the entrance 
of S- 1 1 Lori Reinhaid, who was a star in 
her high school career in Foiloria. Ohio. 
Rdohard was named Gnt-ieam Alt-Ohio 
and Northwest Ohio Player of the Year, 6- 
Dottic Porch and 6- 1 Tnra Muiiillo will 
be calling for some playing lime, which 
will give Ihe Lady Dons a good bench. 

At the gusjrd position, once again, the 
Lady Dons appear lo be a well rounded 
group The moa noted player ai ihis posi- 
tion wiU be 5-9 Lindy Jones, who was 
GLVC Newcomer of ihe Year last teosoo. 
Only being a freshman, Jones held her 
own OS she led Ihe Lady Dons in Ihc scor- 
ing department last season wiih a 12.9 
average. Jones scored 34 points in once 
conlesl last seaion. and looks to be shoot- 
ing for some of the many records that 
assistant coach Lisa Millet set during her 
career at IPFW. 

Amy Perkins is another senior starter 
reluming for her final year, Perkins, al 5- 
7, is the ream's point guard and apparent 
flocn leader as she led the team in minutes 
played and assists la.c seaioD. She gained 
much needed experience by sloiting all 27 



contests lost teoion and should definildy 

see improved performances with Edwards 
back in the middle to shake things up. 

Last season's team lacked the offensive 
firepower that il needed, so [PFW recruit- 
ed some scorers lo add depth to this team. 
This lack of firepower was most notable 
in Ihe backcoun, so coach Kleinfelier 
tecruiied some indis^duols who contribu- 
tion should be felt immediately. 

The first new face is that of Teresa 
Shriver, who is a transfer student from the 
Univenity of Akron. This is an excelleni 
acquisition for Ihc Lady Dons because 
Shriver is very versatile and also brings 
Division I experience to Ihe team. Anolher 
new (dayer that is apt to moke noise is 5-8 
Batb Derry. who will fight for time at the 
guard position. Derry is a graduate of 
Warsaw High School and had a great 
career playing basketball there 

There are other freshman on this squad 
who will be looking to gain Ihe much 
needed experience necessary lo compete 
at this level. Wendy Recker, Shannon 
Wetzel and Sue Gamble, who were oil 
exccUcnl players at Ihe high sehod level, 
look to make an impact on the team now 
and later in Ihdr careers. 

The Lady Dons from Ihis season and Ihe 
team from last season are different in one 
major area, and thai is. Ihia team has 
depth. With this problem mosUy fixed and 
the with the return of Edwards, ihis learn 
should be a force to contend with this sca-

Team with new faces 



Men's team faces challenge of repeating as 
NCAA participant 



Aaroo N. Thompson 
Sports Editor 

If you grew familiar to Ibc faces to the 
IPFW men's basketball team Ihat won 
the GLVC championship last season, 
get ready lo learn again. When Ihe 
IPFW Mastodons lake to Ibe court this 
season, you will see many new faces in 
this campaign. However, this team is 
still a force and has the potential to win 
many gomes this season. 

Coach Andy Piazza has turned Ibe 
IPFW program into a national power- 
house for tbc lost five seasons with four 
20-win seasons in Ibc last five. He has 
assembled a different team to hit the 
floor this seaMin. but these players have 
some experience. 

In the forward and center positions, the 
first area of concern for the Mastodons 
was to replace NCAA II Ail-American 
Scan Gibson. From a look on the roster, 
it looks as if a lot of new faces will be 
called upon lo fulfiU ilut task. The firsi 
noted name of the group is Scoti 
Pabnesiock, who transferred from Ibe 



Univ 



sily 



of Evo 



viUc. 



The 



forward /center who stands at 6-6 has 
great ability that allowed him to have a 
siarcng posihon at Evansville, which is 
a Division I school. Senior Lan Bullard 
rclums lo the lineup Ibis season after a 
knee injury limited his action to just 
seven games. In those seven games, 
BuUaid averaged 8.6 poinU per contesl. 
He coniribuled well in Ibe prc-season. 
and bow well be returns may be Ibe dif- 
ference this season in many ballgames. 
More newcomers make up Ibe renovat- 
ed fronicouri. The addition of 6-6, 220 
pound Jermaine Williams should add a 
little bulk to the Mastodon's inside 
game, Williams, a junior fonn El Paso. 
Teus, started his collegiate baskelbaU 
career at Nortbeaslem Junior College in 
Colorado, Tbc nent addition is a native 
from Chicago named Hillel Watkins. 
Watkins. who brings his 6-7 height lo 



Ihe team, previously attended Eastern 
New Mouco, With this new beighi and 
strength added lo Ibe lineup, Ibe 
Mastodons should be a force to contend 
with on the Inside, 

Only two "full-time" fronteourt players 
return for another run Ihis season, and 
they are K.C, Runyan and Chad North. 
Runyan. a graduate of Madison-Grant 
High School, was tbc only recruit last 
season for the Maslodons. Runyan saw 
liiniled due lo tbc foci tbal lost season's 
front fine was very Uilented. but still was 
able lo average 2.9 points and 1 4 
rebounds in IS games. North, who was 
a wolk-OD lasl sea.son. played in only 13 
games and contributed 1.2 point; per 
conlest. North has worked hard in the 
off-season and has gained a lillle 
weight, giving him a brigbi look for ihe 
future. Anolher newcomer to ibe squad 
is the presence of Jason Burkfaait. who 
graduated lasi year from Muncie Central 
High School. Buriharl stands at 6-7 and 
weighs it) at 235, giving him Ihe bulk 
and size lo imn it inside, Buikhan could 
receive a lot of playing time Ihis season. 

The guard position is a very Strong 
point for Ibe Maslodons Ihis season. 
Competing for a starting spot nill be 6- 
5 Shane Gibson. Gibson received 
Honorable Mention All-GLVC last sea- 
son, as be was the team's second lead- 
ing scorer with 12.9 ppg. Gibson proved 
time and time again his sharp-sboohng 
ability as be drilled 40 percent of bis 
three-point attempts last season. The 
Division II bulletin beheves thai GibMia 
shows much promise as he was a pre- 
season Ail-American pick. 

Another familiar face is Ihat of ScoH 
Simmons. Simmons, who had a great 
season lasl season, aventged 10.1 points 
per conlest which was fourth on the 

long-range shooter, as be nailed 35 
threes to finish second in that category. 
Greg Airingion, who should provide 
some more scoring punch lo ibe back- 



coun Ihis seuon. Aiiington is a transfer 
student from Northeast Community 
College, and he averaged 25.0 points 
per game last season al Northeast, His 
performance lasl season earned 
Airingion NJCAA Honorable Mention 
All- America honors. 

The area of point guard is anolher very 
sti-ong position for the Mastodons Ihis 
season. RUing Ihis very important spot 
are two seasoned guards, Russ Marcinek 
and Jeff Smithey. 

Marcinek, a transfer student from 
Division I Southwest Texas Stole last 
year, has good ability and ii a very 
quick player. Maniinek, who started five 
games lasl season, averaged 2,1 points 
per game and finished third on the team 
in the assist category, 

Smitbey's career will come to a close 
this season, with him being remembered 
as one of Ihe most consislenl guards 
ever lo wear an IPFW uniform. Smiihey 
ranks among tbc leaders in various 
career and single seoson categories. 
Smitbey's leam-orienled play is synony- 
mous with the success that the 
Maslodons have enjoyed in recent years, 
as be averaged 3.1 points per game lost 
season. Smithey conUols ihe ball very 
well and has excellent "downtown" 
shooting obility. 

Finally for ihe Mastodons is Jeff 
Jackson, who is another new face to tbe 
fans and team. A freshman who played 
bis high school basketball at Elkhori 
Cential, was a strong piayet averaging 
15,3 points in 1991-92, Jackson should 
definitely vie for some playing time this 
season, adding more depth to an already 
stivng backcouii. 

The key to Ihis season's r\jn for the 
GLVC championship depends primarily 
on whether all the parts of Andy 
Razza's (earn will mesh together. If he 
can gel bis team to play with the consis- 
lency thai it has displayed in recent 
years, this team will do just fine.

In Ibe time span between the dales of 
Dec. 2-4. 1993, the Lady Mastodons 
of IPFW traveled down lo the Canyon, 
Texas to compete in the 1993 West 
Tenas A&amp;M University Dr. Pepper 
Lady Buff ClttSiic- 

The Lady Mastodons went into this 
tournament knowing that the host 
team, West Texas A&amp;M had won 103 
of their last 107 contests at home. As 
it turns out, the tournament would fol- 
low in the same footsteps. 

First round action pitted IPFW 
against the team form UC-Colorado 
Springs. Being a team that the 
Mastodons hardly ever play, it was 
difficult to know what to expect from 
this team, 

IPFW wasted no time letting them 
know what tbeir game plan was; to 
score. Tbe Lady Eions rushed out to a 
38-28 half-lime lead. UC-Colorado 
Springs fought and clawed back into 
this contest in (he second half, 
outscoring the Lady Dons 33-31. 
However, their scratching and clawing 
in the second half was to no avail 
because the final score came out with 
the Ljidy Dons on top. 69-61 . 

Lindy Jones led the way in the scor- 
ing department as she nailed nine 
shots in fourteen attempts and finished 
wilb 19 points. Her good percentage 
Irom the field was a good indication 
for the entire team, who fmished the 
game with 30-for-49 shooting. 
OITensively. the area where the Lady 
Dons suffered the most was al the 
charily line, where they were below 
.50 at 8-for-17 shooting. Jennie 
Newbard was the master on the boards 
as she caromed five defensive boards. 

Tbe Lady Dons had a slight advan- 
tage over the UC-Colorado Springs 
team as tbey out rebounded them 33- 
31, UC also bad a distinct advonlnge 
over the Lady Dons beyond the diree- 



point arc as they shol 6-for-9 for the 

game whereas the Dons did not make a 
single attempt.

Metropolitan Slate 83-76 in double 
overtime. Henderson State over Fort 
Uwis 88-51 and West Texas AiM 
University over Cal Slate-Los Angeles 
8«.58 

Next up for the Lady Dons was the 
bosi West Texas A&amp;M University, 
which, as mentioned above, hul a con- 
siderably successful record at home. 

The first half of play featured a very 
close competition between the two 
teams, with West Texas A&amp;M holding 
a 44-36 lead, Tbe trend would continue 
on in the second half where the West 
Texas A&amp;M team would continue to 
stretch their lead, with the final being 
87-70. 

The scoring was pretty well-rounded 
again for the Masiodons, wiih Jones 
leading the way again with 10 points. 
Pam Edwards came off the bench to be 
second in tbe scoring department with 
seven points. Jennie Newbard and 
Edwards both crashed the boards as 
they each pulled down 1 1 rebounds. 

Tbe Lady Dons bit 25-ror-37 from the 
free throw stripe, and only l-for-4 from 
in three-point land. West Texas A&amp;M 
garnered this performance by bitting 
16-for-26 from tbe free throw hne. and 
was a remarkable 9-for-l5 from three 
point range. Ibis was probably the dif- 
ference in tbe game for the team from 
West Texas A&amp;M.

Colorado Springs 83-72 i 



Metropolitan Slate beat Fort Lewis 90-

Men's team : 
falls at home 

Aaron N. Tbompno 
Sporli Editor 

The IPFW men's basketball team wel- 
comed the chance In snag a victixy at home 
agtiost the leam from Tri-Stale lost week. 
The opportuaitiej were all there, like the 
fact thai they had home court advaaiage. 
They also te4 at half-iinu. What hqipeocd 
is a lapse oa defeDse in the second half and 
ultimately led to a defeat. 

Offensively, the Masiodoas were led by 
the sconog of Scon Fahneilock *ho anx, 
off the bench to score 17 points. 
Fnhnesiock, who shot 5-for-8 from the field 
aad 7-for-l I from the tree throw siripe. 
Second on the team in scoring was Shtoe 
Gibson, who garnered II points, Gibson 
shot only 3-for-g from ihe field, but did hit 
all five of his free throw onempu. 

Jermajac Williams ruled the l)oards as he 
ripped down seven retioundi, while Gibsoa 
and sc^homore K.C. Ruayan pulled down . 
six boards apiece. Russ Maicinek dished 
out four assists to lead the team in thai cale- . 
goty. 

The gome was truly a tale of two tiolves as 
ihc three point shooting of tbe Mastodons 
went downhill- In the first half, the; 
Mtstodoni shot 3,for-7 from beyond the ■ 
three-poial arc. but shot only I-for-6 Id the ' 
sicood half. In comparison, Tri-Stale was 2- 
fot-6 in the first half while tbey healed up ' 
the net in the second half with a 4-fQr-S 
oailiag of the uey. 

The free Ihrow siory also sununariiea the 
character of this game. The Mastodon* ' 
nailed aJI of their six aiiempts from the . 
chanty suipe m the first half, yet dropped to 
1 t-roc-23 in the second. la the same li^t. 
Tri-State was g-for-IO in the fira half aad 
continued the trend in the second half with 
16-for-IEI shooting. 

The team will cry to retxHind against the 
leom from (^incy College on Saiutday. .
