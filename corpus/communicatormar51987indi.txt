Edilor-in-Chiet 

Ei^t months ago, Tliomas Wallace 
look over the realm as IPFW Chan- 
cellor. This past week, the Fort Wayne 
fommunily discovered that Wallace is 
one of eight candidates being con- 
sidered for Uie presidency of Ten- 
nessee Technological University al 
Cookville. 

Since taking charge at IPFW. 
Wallace has established a task force lo 
examine the nature and quality of 
undergraduate life, has lead an 
academic reorganization proposal, 
pushed for new academic programs 
and hasbegun a plan lo prepare IPFW 
for Ihe I990's, 

But, when the public discovered 
Wallace was a candidate for the 
president's position at Tennessee. 
Wallace said he Ihoughl people were 
making too much of Ihe whole issue. 

"1 guess my comment would be 
'much ado about nothing,'" Wallace 
said last Friday. Wallace said he has 
only talked with a member of the 
search committee "for a few 
minutes." 

Wallace said he was being con- 
sidered (or the president's position 
after a colleague of his in the Ten- 
nessee University system asked him if 
he would mind being considered (or the 
position, "It isn't too unusual that 
when a job opens up people talk about 
peoplethey know." Wallace said. 

Purdue Presidenl Steven Beering 
concurred, "It isn't al all surprising," 
Beering said. "People of Wallace's 
caliber get nominateti (or positions like 
this all the time," 

"I'm asked twice a week to be a 
candidate," Beering said, aboul such 
national searches. Beering added Ihat 
he, incidentally, is not a candidate for 
the president's position (or lU. 

Beering said he was aware thai 
Wallace was a candidate, and Ihat 
people from Ihe Tennessee 
Technological University had asked 




Tlionias Wallace 

liim for a reference before the story 
about Wallace's candidacy appeared 
in the Fort \Vayne paper on Feb 2B, 
However, after the story was in The 
News-Sentinel that day, Beering said 
Wallace called him to express his 
"sliock and embarrassment" at the 
situation. Beering said Wallace told 
him he was not interested in Ihe 
posilion and that he did not actively 
seek out the position 

Wallace would not comment lo the 
reporter (rom The News-Sentinel on 
what he would do i( he was of(ered the 
posilion in Tennessee, However, 
Wallace told a Communicator reporter 
Ihat he was dedicated lo his position al 
IPFW. "So (ar, I'm dedicaled lo 
staying here and doing what I'm doing 
here." Wallace said, "I'm very happy 
with what 's happening here. " 

Last (all. rumors began lo surface 
that Beering was upset al all Uie 
changes Wallace was Irying to make at 
IPFW. Both men claim their working 
relationship is (ine. 

Before joining IPFW. Wallace was 
vice presidenl for academic affairs at 
Old Dominion University in Nor(otk, 
Va. Prior lo that he was a professor 
and administrator al Rochester 
Instituteo( Technology for 10 years. 

Wallace succeeded an unstable 
chronology of chancellors, 

Donald Schwartz was appointed as 
Ihe first chancellor o( IPFW. He 
resigned in 1978 over disagreements 
with Purdue and tU presidents con- 
cerning campus management, Joseph 
Giusli (ollowed him in 1979 and 
resigned in 1985 under pressure from 
Ihe main campuses. 



Rogers puts her IPFW education to the test 



"My job at Magnavox is fascinating; 
it's like putting together a gigantic 
jigsaw puzzle." Lynn Rogers, an 
IPFW alumtla said, "It's also 
(ruslraling. because o(ten I don't know 
when all the pieces will come 
together," 

Rogers, who represenls CPT 
(computer tecimology) on the Purdue 
Mumni Association Board, has been 
working a year and one-half in the 
Army Program Department o( 
Magnavox sodware that routes 
messages-to proper destinations in 
combat situations, 

Recenlly. Rogers flew lo Fort Sill, 
Oklahoma, to run an interoperability 
test with her software program. 
Testing was done in a basement room 
o( the arlillery board — all under 
construction, "I ended up wearing 
jeans and Ixiols and shocking one of the 
sergeants by responding in strong

language to a garbled message." 
Rogers said. The test worked out, and 
it was "quite an experience" for 
Rogers. She said she would like to go 
on to other tests, especially lo 
California, 

Reflecting on her four and one-half 
years at IPFW, Rogers was high on 
praise (or the CPT department, "It's a 
good program and prepares graduates 
(or all paths taken." Rogers said. She 
said she thinks 90 percent of her 
graduating class works at Magnavox, 

Rogers is a Fori Wayne native. 
South Side High School graduate, and 
single parent of Josh, age 12, She said 
she was stimulated to enter computer 



programming by her brother. Kim 
Slahn. A,A,S., EET, 1974; A.A.S , 
CPT; and B.S., ET. 1977. Slahn is a 
systems programmer al Lutheran 
Hospital and a life member o( the 
Purdue Alumni Association 

Producing a qualily product is 
Roger's biggest concern. She would 
like lo slay at Magnavox. but work 
more closely with the army, she said. 
"I think the most important skills an 
analyst can have are interpersonal 
rather than technical," Rogers said, 
"Those skills will determine how well 
you do and how far you go."

Program allows students to work and learn 



By MICIIEI.ER. SHAFFER 

Editor-in-Chief 

One problem many college 
graduales face in trying lo find em- 
ploymenl is a lack of work experience, 

Deborah Conklin, Ihe director o( 
IPFW's recenlly established 
cooperative education program, is 
trying to help many students hurdle 
thai problem. 

Through the cooperative education 
program, which was established 
through a S63,000 grant from the US, 
Department of Education, a student 
may alternate academic studies al 
IPFW with sludy-relaled work. 
Students receive credit and get paid 
(or the work they perform; and, the 
difficulty of the work dbes increase as 



the student progresses through school. 

"By Ihe lime Ihey gel lo their last 
work experience, they're doing the 
work of a graduate," Conklin said. The 
pay the students receive (rom Iheir 
employers ranges from S5,50 to S9. The 
highcsl pay is usually received by 
students working in the engineering 
field, Conklin said. 

Through the program, which began 
serving students on Dec. 1, 1986, 
students majoring in mechanical 
engineering technology, civil and 
architectural engineering lechnology, 
supervision, or electrical engineering 
technology will have an opporlunily lo 
work and attend classes through an 
alternaling schedule pre-established 
by the co-op program. The schedule 



follows IPFW's academic schedule, 
with fall semesters beginning in late 
August; spring semesters beginning in 
mid-January; and summer sessions 
beginning in mid-May, However, in the 
ideal co-opposition, twosiudenls share 
one position and allemale full-time 
study and work with one another 
While one student is working lull-time 
in the co-op posilion, the other student 
is attending school (uti-time. 

The program does not, liowever, 
prevent the student who is working 
full-time from also attending classes 
on a part-time basis during his or her 
work period. Conklin said. The normal 
schedule, she said, would mean that a 
sludcnt in the cooperative education 



program would graduate in five years. 
I( a student decides to supplement the 
work period with classes, she said, he 
or she may graduate in less than Ihe 
(ive years. 

The sludenls (rom Ihe supervision 
and technologies areas do receive one 
credit for each work period, she said. 
However, co-op students do have lo 
pay a fee of S225 per semester for the 
cost of Ihe program's implementallon 
and the salaries of people staffing the 
program. 

"We've patterned our program after 
Purdue-West Lafayette, "Conklin said. 
"primarily because the programs 
involved are Purdue University

Much ado about nothing? 



'■Much ado about nolhing," 

That is the phrase Chancellor Thomas 
Wallace used lo describe the fact that he 
is a [inalisi in a national search for 
presidence of a Tennessee University 

Bui is all the publicity about (his news 
item really much ado about nothing as 
he would have us believe? Absolutely 
not. 

Wallace came to this university eight 
short but arduous months ago. He came 
with recommendations from his 
colleagues as a very high caliber 
educator. He came with grand ideas, 
illusions if you wish, of IPFW in the 
1990's. He saw an opportunity to grab the 
reigns of a growing institution and mold 
it into a quality urban institution. He 
thought he could conquer problems that 
come with being at the helm of IPFW 
while still having to report to a superior 
at another campus. 

However. Wallace soon discovered 
that he wasn't really the person holding 
all of the power to direct this university. 
Last fall. Purdue University President 
Steven Beering flew lo Fort Wayne to 
supposedly, chastise Wallace for his 
eagerness and powerlusl. 

So, keeping in mind ihal perhaps 
IPFW is not the opportunity to single- 
handedly lead a university into the 
1990's. can one honestly say Wallace's 
move is much ado about nothing? 

Wallace has told this newspaper he 
would be dedicated to slaying at IPFW 
and continuing with his plans. However. 
he told a reporter from the News- 
Sentinel thai he would not comment on 
what he would do if he were offered the 
presidency position in Tennessee, 

What should this indicate lo the 
officials of Purdue and lU'' Perhaps it 
indicates that the lime is here to loosen 
the reigns a bit and lei Wallace have a 
little slack. 



Wallace obviously loves control as 
evident in campus-wide changes he 
implemented himself in recent weeks. 
He has made mistakes. Some large. His 
techniques have been questioned by 
many. Maybe he can be found guilty of 
doing things "differently" because it 
worked elsewhere. He has been 
criticized tor trying to lake on too many 
things too fast. 

Worst of all, many feel that he has 
been taking bad advice from the wrong 
people from day one. Some of the people 
you hoped could be trusted and relied on 
to familiarize the newcomer were 
rumored to be undermining his efforts 
from the start. 

Wallace can't be totally blamed 
though. He's been fighting a hard battle 
since he arrived. 

Wallace is an experienced, 
knowledgeable leader who has proven lo 
be innovative in his attempts to gel what 
he wants. This type of employee needs a 
supervisor who delegates authority and 
can let that employee "run the show" in 
his own way with minimal supervision. 
and peers who work along side him, not 
behind his back. 

But is this happening? To outsiders, 
Beering is seemingly trying to maintain 
a heavy hand over Fort Wayne and what 
goes on here. 

The question of true power is nothing 
new to this campus. As a matter of fact, 
it's very old news When a chancellor, 
after only B months, is found to be in 
consideration for a position elsewhere, 
there must be a deep-rooted problem in 
need of resolve somewhere. 

Is it, again, the power-control issue' 
For the sake of our campus' reputation, 
we hope not. We can not afford to lose 
Tom Wallace to anyone, for any reason. 

President Beering — you have your 
campus Let our chancellor have his. 



Change has sour taste 



Change is generally for the belternient 
of society. But when change, or plans to 
make change, goes so far as to preclude 
discussion with people involved, plans 
can turn sour and people ignored grow 
upset 

That is part of what's happened with 
Chancellor Thomas Wallace's proposal 
to eliminate the second floor lounge of 
Walb Memorial Union. 

Wallace has announced plans to 
enclose the open area beside the second 
floor stairwell, converting it into a video- 
mediated classroom equipped to handle 
teleconferences. The move would cost 
the university approximately SGO,000 lo 
rechannel heating and cooling in that 
area, erect permanent waits and doors, 
extend electrical service necessary for 
Computer video hook-ups. add new 
window Irealrnenls and install 
carpetmg. Thai expenditure would give 
llie area all the advantages of a normal 
classroom. The equipment needed to 
complete the video-mediated room 
would cost an estimated §30,000. Grants 
would have to be secured to purchase 
necessary equipment for the rooms. 

Even though the university is not sure 
they can secure funds necessary to 
purchase equipment, they have already 
received approval from Purdue officials 
to make physical changes in the lounge 
area. II sure sounds as if someone is 
putting the cart before the horse 

The problem with this is that people 
who should have been consulted, 
seriously consulted, weren't Prior lo 
Wallace's Feb, 22 meeting with studenls 
in Walb, mosi people were unaware of 
how they would be exactly effected 

Did Wallace sit down and discuss this 
mailer with students who would be 
affected by Ihe loss of the lounge area? 

No. At the meeting, Wallace avoided a 
question aboul Ihe lounge change from a 
surprised Joe Molherwell, student body 
president. When Molherwell persisted. 
Wallace flippantly replied thai he was 
still considering a second alternative for 
Ihe space moving his office over 
because he liked the view so well, 

Was Ihe University Resource and 
Policy Committee ever apprised of the 
idea to wall-in the second floor lounge? 

No. Members of ihe committee 
expressed surprise when they learned of 
Wallace's plan. These people found out 
second-hand, not from Wallace himself. 
To top it all off they found out after 
Wallace made his announcement lo 
students al his Feb. 22 meeting. 

Was the architect of Walb Memorial 
Union. Hermann Strauss, ever consulted 
in this matter'' 

No When contacted by a 
representalive of this paper, Strauss 
expressed surprise and astonishment as 
to "why in Ihe world" the university 
administration would Want to enclose 
such an open, airy and aesthetically- 
pleasing section of Walb, especially a 
section al the very core of the building. 

Was the task force on Ihe nature and 
quahty of undergraduate life allowed to 
complete their examination of 
environmental changes and 

beautification and Ihe impact it would 
have on student life before Wallace 
proposed such a change to Walb? Was 
the same committee, who was given a 



year to complete their examination, 
even consulted in the matter? 

No. This group was informed of the 
"lounge conversion" after Wallace met 
with the students Feb. 22. This task force 
was formed last fall and given a year to 
make a report on what impact 
environmental changes would have on 
student life. 

Students, (acuity and staff of IPFW. 
especially those housed in or frequently 
utilizing Walb, were shocked and 
outraged to hear of this ridiculous 
change. There are too many questions 
left unanswered not only concerning the 
lounge elimination issue, but of the 
whole newly-unveiled decision making 
process seemingly in effect at IPFW. 

Is it fair to IPFW faculty, staff and 
students to propose changes, get 
approval for these changes from the 
officials in Purdue-West Lafayette 
before even asking people at IPFW what 
they think of the idea? Is it fair to 
propose a video-mediated classroom, 
eliminate lounge space when there are 
no professors who have, when asked, 
said they would be interested in 
conducting televised courses? 

Have other locations been considered'' 
Has the lecture hall in Classroom- 
Medical, room 159, been considered for 
Ihe video-mediated classroom'' Has the 
university considered the graduated 
seating rooms in Ketller HalP There are 
two. one in the basement and one on the 
second floor. They are all big enough to 
seat more people than the area on the 
second floor of Walb ever could. 

irWallace expects to have 2000 more 
studenls a week utilizing the union 
building next fall, where does he expect 
them to go between classes? Will Walb 
be destined to become another Ketller 
Hall with students lining the floors and 
hallways' 

Has Wallace actually considered all 
the uses of that second-floor lounge? It 
can be used for sit-down meals i as it has 
been frequently in the past), as a 
furnished study-area for studenls, for 
art exhibits and by groups sponsoring 
activities on campus, such as the Very 
Special Arts Festival conducted 
throughout the halls and all non-office 
space in Walb last Monday and Tuesday. 

Surely Wallace must want to enhance 
the quality of student life on campus. 
Why else would he have established the 
task force on the nature and quality of 
undergraduate life'' Many are beginning 
to feel Wallace established all his little 
committees as a token gesture to make 
the faculty "feel " their opinions were 
welcomed. 

One last question: Everyone is 
questioning how someone new. at the 
opposite end of campus, avoiding long 
established decision-making channels 
and without proper research and input, 
can make a qualified decision about 
what should and shouldn't be in Walb 
Union. 

In one respect we feel sorry for 
Chancellor Wallace , he's new and 
obviously isn't aware of how people at 
IPFW dislike having doors slammed in 
their faces or gelling their toes stepped 
on, Whalyou need to do, sir, is stop, turn 
around, and ask the person behind you 
what it's like before it's too late.

Spring break: Fori

spring break can happen 
right here in good old 
Indiana. For some of us low 
on lunds, or just not inclined 
lo take the jaunl to Florida 
again, there is hope (or a 
relaxing and fun vacation. 



First, there are two state 
parks within an hour driveof 
Fort Wayne. Pokagon State 
Park is located norlh of the 
cily, past Angola off high- 
way G9. Just take 69 north 
past Angola and jtju won't 
have any problem finding 
the park. Al Pokagon you 
can enjoy a nature walk, an 
animal sanctuary, which 
includes an area designed 
for buffalo, and a toboggan 
run. which is fun for all ages. 

Also found al Pokgaon is

'Dead Kennedys' produce latest, last album

ByDAVEWISNER 
Start Writer 

It's really a shame. After 
eight yeare. Jello Biafra and 
friends have finally called il 
quits. Amidst vicious attack 
from the PMRC i Parents 
Music Resource Center) and 
facing a possible jail sen- 
tence, lead singer Jello 
Biafra has disbanded the 
Dead Kennedys, and we are 
left with the band's last 
album, Bedtime for 
Democracy. 

Biafra's lyrics 
always been conli 
that's what got him in hot 
water in the first place, and 
h^ latest creation stays in 
the same vein. Topics range 

poisoning i "Cesspools in 
Eden") to Hollywood's 
glorifying ofwar r'Kambozo 
the Clown") And of course 
there is the anti-Reagan, 
anti-conformist ideals thai 
Bialra has always written 

I must say that this music 
isn't tor everyone. The music 
IS a cacophony o( shrieking 
guitar, pounding drums, and 
throbbing bass lines, bul the 
important aspect of this 
land IS the lyrics, which are 
somewhat difficult (o hear, 
bul the producers have 
thankfully published a lyric 

This band is definitely non- 
mainstream, and I admit 
that the frantic beat and 



sound gels tiresome after 
awhile, but it is different. 
and it does inspire you (o 
think, unlike so much 
commercial radio thai puts 
your brain to sleep these 
days. 

It's really loo bad that 
Tipper Gore and the PMRC 
are trying to destroy the 
First Amendment lo the 
Constitution of the United 
Stales by trying to imprison 
Biafra and other musicians, 
poets, and filmmakers for 
their political or rehgious 
beliefs The only ones who 
really suffer are the free- 
thinking peoples of this 
country, but I guess they're a 
dying breed.

very enjoyable ensemble of 
tunes. Warchoute has 
definitely evolved from 
Husker Du's earlier records, 
which have a harder edge 
and aren't as commercially 
oriented. This double album 
is much more melodic and 
down-beat, though Bob 
Mould's angry guitar is very 
much present. The t&gt;and 
seems to be swinging more 
toward psychadelia (jusl

Carnivorous plant drains blood 
from his master's fingertips 



ByDAVEWISNER 
Staf I Writer 

When I go to see remakes 
of movies, especially good 
movies. I am very skeptical, 
as 1 have seen very few good 
remakes. Looking at the cast 
for Little Shop of Horrors, 1 
knew (hat even if i( was 
going to bo a bad rehashing, 
I would probably be in for 
some laughs. Fortunately, 
and somewhat to my sur- 
prise. I saw a very funny, 
welt-done movie; not jusl a 
remake of the original 1955 
black and white cult classic, 
but a musical film version of 
(he Broadway play based on 
Iheoriginal. 

The casting of Moratiis as 
Seymour is superb Seymour 



is a; nerdy wimp who 
stumbles across a car- 
nivorous plant that falls to 
Earth during a total eclipse. 
He [^ames the plant after 
Audrey, his bubble-headed, 
blonde, co-worker who has a 
voice comparable to thai of 
Sniffles the Mouse. 

Another splentlid ■ per- 
formance is given by Vin- 
cent Gardenia, who plays 
Mr Mushnik. their boss, 
Seymour displays Audrey II 
in Mr. Mushnik's florist 
shop, and becomes the 
center of attention with his 
bizarre new plant. 

Seymour soon learns, 
however, that the price of 
fame musl be paid, as 
Audrey II can only be fed by 



blood, at first squeezed out of 
Seymour's fingert ips. then 
as the plant grows to huge 
proportions, larger game. 

If you haven't seen the 
original. 1 won't spoil the 
plot for you. It is a wonderful 
plot, loaded with en- 
tertainment, and the 
musical score this time 
makes it even belter. 

Probably the funniest part 
of this flick is played by 
Steve Martin, who plays a 
sadistic dentist and brutal 
boyfriend lo Audrey, i 
haven't seen Martin this 
funny since ■'ITie Jerk." 
Other noteworthy roles are 
Wink Wilkenson, a weird 



disc jockey played'by John 
Candy, and a masochist 
played by Bill MurraJ, 

The highlight of the film is 
definitely Audrey II. The 
creators of this plant have 
given us a living, sentient 
personality, full of life and 
character. The voice of 
Audrey II is done by Levi 
Isaacs, of the Motown group 
The Four-Tops. 

The movie was directed by 
Frank Oz, better known as

Men's fashions r''''''"' """' 
appear bright 
toward Spring 



BylLENESMITH 
Staff Writer 

Everyone likes a sharp- 
dressed man But after a 
lung winter, some guys may 
feel iike they have been in a 
"fashion hybernation." 
Fortunately spring is nearly 
here, and there is no belter 
time than right now for guys 
lo get out and buy some new 

Men have a number of 
choices this season when it 
comes to slacks. According 
lo Chuck Robie of Silver- 
man's Men's War, casual 
panis will be available in 
sever^ fabrics, including 
canvas and twill. Pants with 
elastic waistbands and cuffs, 
and cargo pockets, are ex- 
pected to be popular. 

Predominant colors for 
patits will be blacks, tans, 
and blues, as well as the 
usual spring array of soft 
pastels and medium brighls 
The emphasis in dreits pants 
will be on a 
textured weave, A variety of 
colors will t&gt;e available. The 



trend in jeans will be away 
from the deep indigo of the 
pasl few years, toward 
lighter shades of blue. 

Some exciting things will 
be appearing in shirts this 
season. Bright colors and 
prints will l&gt;e showing up on 
short sleeved knits. The 
emphasis on short-sleeved 
sports shirts, on the other 
hand, will not only be on the 
colors themselves, but on 
new, styles of dye treatment. 
Shirts that have been 
through such processes as 
puff printing, overdying, and 
pigment dyeing are expected 
lo become popular soon. 

Many shirts will fall along 
a more traditional line this 
spring Kerry McGuire of 
Nobsons for Men sees 
the short sleeved polo shirts 
continuing to be a big item, 
showing up on both pastels, 
and brighter colors. Shirts 
with stripes, both fine, and 
bold, will also continue to be 
big hits. Everyone's 
favorites — cotton and cotton 
blends — will be popular as

After moving their record 
to n-7. the IPFW men's 
volleyball team, ranked Hlh 
in the nation, will travel to 
Columbus, Ohio, Friday (o 
challenge Ohio State in a 
Midwestern Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association 
match beginning at 8 p.m. 



Ball Slate, a narrow 9-lS. 
15-12, 16-14, 12-15, 16-14 
winner over IPFW on 
Wednesday, currently leads 
the MIVA with a 4-0 con- 
ference record. IPFW Is 
holding down the second slot 
with a 1-2 mark while Ohio 
Slate, li-8 overall, is third al 
0-3, The fourth conference 
team, Graceland College, 
has yet to play a MIVA 
match. 



IPFW needs a win at Ohio 
Stale to stay within shouting 
distance of front-running 
Bail Stale. IPFVJ has beaten 
the Buckeyes twice this 
season, first in the cham- 
pionship match of the Fort 
Wayne National Bank 
Classic and, more recently, 
in a tough Tive-game match 
that counted in the con- 
ference standings. This will 
be the Volleydons' first of 



Sophomore Jay Golsteyn 
continues lo pace the IPFW 
offense and has 369 kills for 
the season. His 32 percent 
attack percentage is also 
tops among regular hitters 
on the team. Senior Ted 
Owen has 74 blocks to pace 
the Volleydons in that 
depart men I . 



McGuire analyzes self in interview 



This is the time of year, I 
think, that all coaches should 
have their own teams 
scouted — hire a private 
scouting service lo see how 
your opponents see you — to 
get ready for Ihe post-season 
conference tourney and also 
the big dance al the NCAA. 

So, while you're finding 
out what your strengths and 
weaknesses are, I think I'll 
take my own advice, and 
have somebody take a look 
al Al McGuire and find out 
some of the things that make 
him tick. A psychological 20 
questions, sort of, while 
you're all beefing yourself 
up for Ihe checkered flag 

Q. What's your biggest 
strength as a TV announcer? 
And your biggesl weakness? 

M . My strengths, I believe, 
are working with Dick 
Enberg, and also my style al 
the end of a tight game, 
because then I'm coaching. 
As a matter of fact, all 
through Ihe broadcast. I'm 
coaching, I don't second 
guess. 1 give facts before 
they happen, so I make as 
many mistakes as the 
coaches of the teams who 
are playing. 

My weakness is a lack of 
vocabulary, and not knowing 
the rules of the game. And, 
now and Uien, in a game i 
fade out. for some reason or 
another, if the game gets 
boring. 

Q. Who's better behind the 
microphone, you or Billy 
Packer'' And why? 

M. I think that Billy is a 
better analyst , that he knows 
more about the game than I 
do, and that he has a greater 
love for the game than I do. 
The only difference is: He 
knows the business, I FEEL 
the business, 

I think a lot of times, that 




Billy is like a Great 
Clinician, whereas I'm more 
for the "barracks-ing," the 
cull type, sometimes almost 
disrespectful to the 
seriousnras of the situation. 

Q. What's the biggest 
difference between coaching 
and announcing? 

M. The biggest difference 
is that there's no ulcers. And 
you're not hung in effigy. Bui 
then you don't gel the other 
side of it either. The 
tremendous high ot victory, 
the white snow and the 
eagle. The heights and 
depths just aren't as great as 
the roller coaster ride frorn 
Ihe coaches' bench. 

Q. If they ever made a 
movie of your life, who 
would you want lo play you? 

M. I think that guy. 
Professor Invin Corey, 
would be Ihe right guy. He'd 
get the pari, but I'd prefer it 
to be someone 20 years or 
younger Really, tiiough, I 
don't think I could have a 
movie done, because it 
would have lo be a true 
movie, and I'd end up being 
divorced. 

My movie is riding the 
molorbike, going for my toy 
soldiers, and slipping into 
Dick Enberg 's limo, when 
everybody thinks it's my 

Q, If you were a player. 



would you have wanted lo 
play for Al McGuire. 

M. I'd have a hard job 
playing for myself, because 
usually you don't like anyorie 
who's like yourself- The 
people who are like you are 
the ones you have the most 
problems with. But Ihe only 
reason I'd enjoy playing for 
me is because I was a 
defensive player. I couldn't 
shoot, and for 13 years at 
Marquette I coached 
defense. 

Why? Because defense is 
like water — it finds it's own 
level, it's there every night. 
Offense is like the stock 
market — nobody knows 
where it is, it's always all 
over the place, 

I think f'd give myself 
more grey hairs, because 1 
was always a dancehall 
player, pushing and shoving. 
As a coach, I've always 
believed that you make 
people mentally tough — 
that creates winning. 

I believe you can almost 



will a win, if you have 
adequate players who have 
eliminated the jealousy with 
each other, wlio know who 
the stars are, who know two 
guys will be pros, two wilt go 
to graduate school, two will 
lake over their fathers' 
business, and two will be 
blue collar workers. 

As an example, I always 
go liack to Bill Neary, who 
started on my championship 
team in 1977. He averaged 
1 .3 points a game, but he was 
as important as Butch Lee 
and Bo Ellis, who were 
scoring in double figures, 
because one ball can't Cake 
care of five stars. You must 
have hall players who are 
like little brothers, 

Q. The truth: How old are 
you? 

M. I'm by the speed limit, 
past the double nickel. I have 
four grandchildren, and like 
anyone that's ever played 
pro ball, in that they start 
subtracting once they gel 
into their early 30's. 
Actually, I'm on my third 
body and I'm trying to make 
a deal with the true Head 
Coach in the Sky to l&gt;e riding 
my motorbike on the south 
side of New Zealand at the 
start of the next century. 

Q. Is there any truth lo 
what Billy Packer says, that 
you're really a nice guy? 

M. I think we all think 
we're fair in life. But you 
have lo remember that 
Hitler and Mussolini thought 
they were fair too.
