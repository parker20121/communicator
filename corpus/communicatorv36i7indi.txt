Saxophonist Boots Randolph has been bringing 
audiences to their feet since the early '60s, when his 
signature song, "Yakety Sax," first hit the airwaves. A 
native of Paducah, Ky., Boots' first opportunity on stage 
was with his family's band. He learned to play a variety of 
instruments but settled on the sax at age 16. He joined 
the Army and was privileged to perform with the Army 
band. After his discharge in 1946, Randolph began 
working professionally. After "Yakety Sax" became a hit, 
he moved to Music City in 1961. Randolph was the first 
to play sax on recordings with Elvis, and he also played 
on Roy Orbison's "Oh, Pretty Woman," Al Hirt's "Java," 
REO Speedwagon's "Little Queenie," and Brenda Lee's 
"Rockin' 'Round The Christmas Tree."

Importance of education 

Education is by far the largest expenditure in the state of 

Education is extremely important. 1 have two young children; 
Graydon is 2 years old and Kayla is 4 years old. When I moved back 

Fort Wayne, 1 made sure to buy a house in a school system that 

hought could help mv children get the education I want them 

have. 

Everyone has known that the graduation rates in Indiana have 
been"bverstated in a huge way. What kind of signal does this 
send to our children when tin schools themselves put out bad 



m about graduation rates because ( 

! embarrassing to the schools and to the state government? 

The State has been claiming a graduation rate of 90 percent or 
HIGHER for many years. Yesterday, at tlu "LducatiunRoundtable," 

liana admitted that the graduation rate in the last few years is 

&gt;st likely between 66 and 80 percent. 

If the government cannot do the math to figure out a simple 
percentage, why should we expect Indi.m.i students id understand 
how to do math? 

Niki Kelly wrote in her article that RY( S claimed a graduation 

e of 88.2 percent in 2002. The lournal Gazette analysis showed 
the graduation rate to be 61 percent in 2002. That is shameful. 

amazing how misleading statistics can be. for example, I 
have done extensive research on the per student cost of education 

Indiana; last year it cost us $10,787 dollars per student. If you 
go to Indiana's website they claim a much lower figure. Maybe our 
government officials did poorly on the ISTEP as well?

Europe just like the next person. Still, I wasn't abstaining 
from eating value meals at McDonalds or indulging in 
the occasional pastry. Not eating food associated with a

any son of unpatriotic behavior. It means you're hungry 
and the food tastes good. 

Oct. 23, 2001 was not a good day for the criminal 
justice system. The poor 1^-year old Ansche I ledgepelh. 
who was arrested as a juvenile delinquent for eating one 
of America's favorite fast-food sides, was treated like a 
common criminal. She was told to put down her French

I don't blame Hedgepeth or her family for allowing the

Moving to MAC 
may not be the 
best option 



West Point 

By Nick West 
nwest@ipfw&lt; 



i, which joined in 2003. 
The move will allow coach Terry Stefankiewicz 
and his men's program to play in the conference 
championship and a berth in 



- such as women's volleyball, basebi 
basketbaJl - to compete against the typically 
more successful MAC programs. 

Before people get too excited, folks should 
realize that IPFW" is, in many respects, inferior to 
MAC schools. Whether it is higher-paid coaches, 
a better talent level, a loftier spending budget or 
larger facilities, MAC schools are in a conference 
for a reason; IPFW isn't. 

So it should be no secret that Athletic Director 
Mark Pope is going to send his big-time programs 
to compete with the MAC schools. He made 
certain that a stipulation with his men's soccer 
team joining the conference would also include 
a playing schedule for IPFW's most successful 
program - women's volleyball - to take on 10 
MAC opponents next year. 

With an independent championship trophy 
brought home in two of the last three years - and 
a 12-2 record as of Oct. 3 this season-the women's 
volleyball team is by far the best program IPFW 
has to offer. They've already handily dropped two 
MAC schools (Eastern Michigan and Ball St.) this 
year, so let's send them to battle with those same 
schools 10 times next year. 

To bang with the big boys, you need your 
biggest boy to do the banging... or something. 
Great job, Mr. Pope. 

s basketball team will take on three 
MAC schools this year and the women two. 
Expect the schedules to be sprinkled more heavily 
with MAC opponents in 2007 and 2008, when the 
basketball programs have a few more years to 
improve. Under new head coach Dane Fife, the 
men's basketball program is going to take off 
by the time a MAC-heavy schedule swings into 

In contrast, the baseball program should 
be ready to make a serious mark against MAC 
competition by this season, as they have improved 
every year under head coach Billy Gernon.

team effort against the Loyola 
University-Chicago Ramblers 
at the Hefner Soccer Complex. 

Overall a very balanced 
match up, the Ramblers and 
the Mastodons went into two 
overtimes before the struggle 
ended. The refs were cautious 
.in calling penalties and a few 
trips went unnoticed, but 
IPFW controlled the penalties, 
although neither team was 
uncontrollable or dirty. 

Early on, the girls were on the 
defensive as a very aggressive 
Rambler offense did everything 
it could to score a precious 
goal. The first strike was by 
Loyola, which was easily saved 
by goalkeeper Shannon Lynn. 
IPFW was able to respond with 
their first offensive attack lead 
by Anika Apar, whose shot on 
goal went over. This balanced 
control of the ball by both 
teams characterized the early 
minutes of the game.

Loyola's Katie lleidenrelch shot 
a high kick over Lynn for the 
first goal of the game at 24:15. 

The Mastodons responded 
as Apar displayed infinite 
energy to charge down the 
field with Lindsay Williamson 
and Brittany Saylor to attack 
the Ramblers defensive 
wall. However, their amazing 
attacking bared no fruit as the 
relatively rested Loyola defense 
repulsed them time and time 
again, forcing the play to the 
midfield, which sadly was a 
trench-battle IPFW just could 
not win in the first half. 

In the final minutes of the 
first half, a tireless IPFW drove 
to the net again and again, but 
could not get past the Ramblers' 
Christy Reichgelt. 

The second half began with 
the cheering section for IPFW

Crash DVD review 



ByJessBoldt 



Earlier this month, Lions Gate Studio Released Crash on 
DVD. The film tracks the various lives of different people 
as they deal with racism, either within themselves or with 
others. Screenwriter, director, and producer, Paul Haggis (Million 
Dollar Baby) delivers a proactive vel somewhat overbearing film 

"Crash" boasts a large cast of accomplished actors. Some 

of the more outstanding perlorm.ini.es cume from Michael Pen,!, 
Matt Dillon, Nona Gaye, and Chris "Ludacris" bridges. Some of 
the more disappointing perfc

seem extremely forced .mil i liebe. Ihe film seems to over-extend 
itself at times, trying to tie all the characters' lives together in an 
interesting way. 

The DVD itself lacks any substantial features. There is a short 
introduction by I taggK .i 1 - well as an unentertaining behind the 
scenes documentary Fur those who pick up the DVD at Best Buy, 
you get an extra disk with tenure- such as Script to Screen views 
and other features. The bonus disk does not really add anything 
substantial. 

The technical features include 5.1 and 2.0 Dolby Digital 
Audio. This DVD version is rated R for language, sexual content,

unrealistic and overbearing in Irving to bring the message to the 
audience. Basically, when ( rash K good, ii's good. When it's bad, 
it's had. When it's neither, it's "Magnolia." 



Ihe dialogue is often euivmeh heavy- handed at times. There 
is barely a line in the film that does not center around racism. 
which gives the impression that many of the characters only exist 
to bring up race issues. 

In one particular scene, the Los Angeles D.A. (Fraser) argues 
with his wife (Bullock) because he refuses to change the locks 
after a Hispanic locksmith (lYnaj just finished changing

incident so he does not come across as a racist. Scenes like this 
offer little buffer between the themes of the movie and takes away 
from the potential depth of many of the characters. 

As the story moves along, each i ' 
an event that forces ti 
officer (Dillon) seems to change his demeanor during a traumatic 
event. Such plot devices are frequeni during the film. 

Haggis' flow and use of coincidence to bring the characters 
to together is almost identical to Paul Thomas Anderson's 
"Magnolia." There are a few scenes which seem more like blatant 
rip-offs rather than creative imitation. Despite Crash's lack of 
narrative creativity, Haggis' screenplay is extremely clever at 
times. There are plenty of twists that will keep most people 
engaged until the end. 

One of the best aspects of this movie is how many of the 
characters are not as black and white with regards to a difficult 
subject. There are a few really good surprises and thought-

Freakonomics book review 



One of the most fascinating things about l-reakonomks is 
the sheer, well, freakiness ol it Steven I). Levitt is an economics 
professor at the University of ( hic.igo Me has been awarded the 
John Bates Clark medal, an award given to the best economist 
under forty. Yet, as he himself admits in the book, he knows 
absolutely nothing about economics. He's not a numbers guy. A 
little strange, don't you think-" An economics professor that knows 
nothing about numbers? Absolutely. 



dealers still live with their mothers? 

Yes, you read that correctly. See, Levitt doesn't bother with 
boring number crunching. Bather, he says that he's fascinated by 
the freaky side of em mm lies i hence the title I, i lie side that attempts 
to solve weird social anil cult ma I quesiions using statistics and 
data interpretation. 

There are six excellent i hapters in ibis hook that run a gamut of 
issues. From exploring why the Ku Klu\ Kl.m is like a group of real 
estate agents, to asking why the crime dropped so dramatically 
in the mid to late nineties, to questioning whether a child's name 
makes a difference in his or her success as an adult, Levitt uses a 
simple formula: analyze ihc statistics surrounding an issue and 
find what is being said between the lines. 

The central contention he makes clear is this: there are 
relationships between tads, but ihey may not be as clear as we 
think. What is causal may not be what we perceive it to be. For 



instance, the crime drop in the nineties? It had less to do with 
more police on die si reels than we might think. 

In the first chapter, I evut and Dubnerask ihe question: what do 
schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? The answer 
is cheating, and bow these two authors prove it is fascinating. 
Using statistical evidence and data, they analyze mandatory 
testing results and compare this broad picture with sumo match 
outcomes. Their conclusion is that cheating is more widespread 
than we may think, vei trickier to determine as well. 



to make judgments about the morality of the conclusions they 
come up with; this is the simply the conclusion that the facts lead 
them to find. The hidden message, of course, is that in life, perhaps 
unfortunately, facts may not always fit our belief system or the
