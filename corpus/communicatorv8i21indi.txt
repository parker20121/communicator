Poor reasons for denying 
engineering degree given 



Student senator^s reference to prostitution

A bachelor's degree in engineer- 
ing will not be abtainable on the 
IPFW campus due to a recent 
decision by the Indiana Commission 
for Higher Education ( ICHE ) . Three 
reasons given by the ICHE for denial 
of the program were 1) the state of 
Indiana is second in the notion in 
producing engineers, 2) engineering 
is an expensive program and there 
are bachelor degrees offered at 
tliree universities in Indiana al- 
ready; Lafayette, Indianapolis and 
calumet, and 3) the overall effect on 
private schools in the area, speci- 
fically Tri-State college and the 
Indiana Institute of Technology, 
may be adverse. 

The need for a bachelor's degree 
program on campus has been re- 
cognized not merely by the school 
itself but also, and very energeti- 
cally by area businesses and in- 
dustry's. At the present engineering 
curriculum to be eligible to grant a 
bachelor's degree. 

According to university officials 
the cost for these additions would be 
' and compu- 



I program would be two faculty 
imbers" salaries for the first year, 
i if enrollment rises, another for 
) following year.

I, shouldn't they be proud of that? 
he ICHE making decisions based 



desirable locations of em- 
ployment such as the West of East 
. leaving Indiana with a short- 
age. This was expressed by many 



local industries including General 
Electric. Dana. Harvester, NiPSCO, 
Goodyear, Magnavox, I&amp;M, Tol- 
keim, Eckrich and others at a 
meeting last week before two repre- 
sentatives of the ICHE. They cited a 
need of 1200 engineer 
Indiana over the next ten years; 



latere the had appeared in the paper lover- IPFW r

Timediately the talk If I was 



who have had to quit jobs, leave 

expenses at Lafayette to complete 

order to get their bachelor's degree 
in engineering. Why impose on stu- 

the justification that three bachelors 
programs already exist in Indiana 

The other area schools that may 
be effected by a bachelors program 
at IPFW are both private institu- 
tions. Even if it may be the ICHE's 
function to be concerned about 
private universities programs and 
how they're functioning (though its 
doubtful), the implicit suggestion 
that students interested in an en- 
gineering degree go to these institu- 
tions for their education or even to 
supplement their courses at IPFW is 
a little ridiculous. 

The whole mess of credit trans- 
ferability is bad enough within the 
lU-PU system much less on a 
private-to-public university
