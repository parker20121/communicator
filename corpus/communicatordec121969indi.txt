ities: 1.) students and faculty 2.) 
groups and activities affiliated 
with the university 3.) commu- 
nity. Construction hopefully will 
begin by next fall.

Circle K ha 



taken on a new project as b 
suit— being friends to 12 and 13 
year old boys from the Fort 
Wayne Children's Home. "We 
think these kids deserve a second 
chance. They've come from bad 
home situations but are extremely 
intcrrigent and are athletically 
very capable. We want to try to 
bring these kids hack into so- 
ciety," said Dave Blosser, Pro- 
ject Chairman. 

Circle K plans to take the 
boys out for rush activities as 
hockey games and other sport- 
ing events. The project began 
with the group trying to get ac- 



quainted with the boys. "We 
don't want to try to plan activi- 
tics in advance as much as we 
would like to leave it up to the 
kids as to what they want to 
do," stated Dan Symonds, Pre- 
sident. "We want to be elastic 
and to create a mutual transfer 
of ideas," added Blosser. 

Circle K is a Kiwanian-sp on-

Guest Editorial 



by Student Government 



We, Uie Student Government of 
Indiona-Purdue University at Fort 
Woyne, in our continuing effort 
to keep the comraunitv informed 
of activities at the largest college 
campus in Northeastern Indiana, 
ore concerned about the rising 
coils of educadon. 

At this point in lime, when tax- 
payers demand holding the line 
on taxes and when students can- 
not afford the burdening cost of 
education, our university has de- 
cided lo build the first new build- 
ing of our campus eipaosion plan 
in our parking lot. It will be nec' 
essary for students to pay for these 
facilities tirhich ivill be lost. 

Approximately one-third of the 
students at our campus already 
work. Another substantial seeonent 
of the students is married. Their 
bud pets are spent. Tliey cannot 
afford paid parking. 

Tlic parents ivho ore helping 
tlieir children through college, es- 
pecially those w-itli more than one 
child, ivill abo feel the squeeze. 

Businesses who arc paying Oicir 
employees to furllier tlieir educa- 
tion will think twice before paj-ing 
even higher fees. 

A sample poll indicated that 
about 96% of the students op- 
posed paid parking. The adminis- 
tration told us that if the students 
knew all the reasons for paid 
parking they wouldn't oppose it. 
After discussing the mailer with 
tlic administration, we in Student 
Govern racnl feel that if the stu- 
dents knew all the reasons for 



paid parking, 99% would oppose 
iL 

Within forty-eight hours, a pe- 
tition drive beaded by the Alpha 
Epfilon Kappa fraternity gathered 
2,201 signatures. This represents 
the greatest outpouring of opinion 
on our campus at any time. Tbey 
were presented to tlic Student As- 
sembly ivhich then passed the fol- 
lowing rsolution: 

We the Student Assembly of 
the indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne 
Canipu' are unanimously opposed 
to the students of the Indiana- 
Purdue Fort Wayne Campus shoul- 
dering the burden of paid parking 
in any form. 

In addition, hundreds of flyers 
opposing paid parking have been 
dj.'^tributed. One informative rally 
with over five hundred students 
attending was held. The Associa- 
tion of Regionol Campuses also 
endorsed the campaign of the In- 
iliana-Purduc students opposing 
paid parking. 

A letter opposing paid parkin g 
wot also sent lo Governor Whit- 
comb, all Indiana legislators, and 
other state officials. 

We urge citizens of the Fort 
Wayne community who are inter- 
esled in maintaining sanity in 
spending lo join wilh us in oppos- 
ing paid parking. Contact either 
Dean Nelson or Chancellor Broy- 
les, Indiana.Purdue University, 
Coliseum Blvd. East, Fort Wayne, 
Indiana 46805 and urge Ihem to 
building somewhere

A Conservative Estimate 



by Don Sluckey 

Approximately three weeks ago 
a group of concerned students at 
Indiana University in Blooming- 
ton {our sister campus) met at 
the local pub and formulated pro- 
ject Top Secret, Wishing to spread 
their ingenions project to all 
college campuses across the state, 
tbey began making phone calls to 
those sympathetic to their cause. 
After being rejected by their ori- 
ginal contact, they decided to 
call me. After a thirty minute 
conversation, I decided to initiate 
project Top Secret at this campus. 

Proieci Top Secret is a dedi- 
cated effort by concerned patriots 
lo expose Communists and Com- 



munist sympathizers wilhin the 
faculty and administration of the 
various colleges in the slate of 
Indiana. Our work is already un- 
derway. We have already uncov- 
ered some astonishing documents, 
and in certain cases have what 
we feel is conclusive evidence. 
The battle is just begun. We ivill 
continue until no secret is left 
unexposed. There are no doors 
permanently locked. There are 
no lips permanently scaled. I feel 
the victory will be ours.

Permit S75 per year 

Orange Permit S35 per year 

Green Permit S 5 per year 

While there are no fees assessed at the present time on the

lished, and in effect, by September, 1970. 



Student Government 
Comment 

by Mark Souder, Student Body President 

"Student Power" is frequently heard throughout our 
campus these past weeks. Probably no two people agree on 
exactly what "Student Power" means, but at this point it 
might be wise to e.xplain what "Student Power" means to 
me. 

Being somewhat traditional, I maintain a respect for 
age, authority, and tradition. If someone is older, it means 
they have experienced more and presumably have learned 
from past mistakes. Authority commands respect if for no 
other reason than authority meana that someone other than 
you has the power. Tradition deserves respect because it 
generally has survived for a reason and it provides needed 
stability. 

On the other hand, one should not overdue his respect 
for age, authority, and tradition. Just because someone is 
older doesn't necessarily make him always correct. Authority 
can be misused. Tradition frequently contains nothing based 
on sound logic. Therefore, I don't feel students should re- 
main silent merely because someone is older or in a position 
of authority, or not challenge something because it has 
always been that way. 

"Student Power" is too often viewed negatively by so- 
called adults. When administrators think they are always 
right, they aren't. Students are better qualified to handle 
certain things, such as student activities, and should be 
allowed control over them. As students become better edu- 
cated younger and mature earlier, there are more decisions 
which they should be allowed to participate in making and 
control. As students pay a larger percentage of their edu- 
cation, their control over it should increase. 

Sometimes opposition to "Student Power" arises from 
means used. Violence to demonstrate "Student Power" is 
not really "Student Power," but rather is barbarism. "Stu- 
dent Power" can be demonstrated by the use of all student 
resources through the system to support a particular goal. 
By uniting and mustering their strength, students are a 
formidable foe. 

At this campus there will hopefully be a continued show 
of responsible "Student Power" and rational attempt made 
to increase that power. 



Letters 
to the editor 



On Wednesday morning, De- 
cember 3, 1969, I experienced a 
pulmonary muscular spasm while 
walking to my car parked in the 
handicapped student area. This 
paroxysm, a side effect of em- 
physema, renders its victims com- 
pletely immobile and leaves him 
gasping for breath. All alone, I 
became terrified lltat each des- 
perate gasp woud be my last. 

Sudderdy two young men, ob- 
viously students, came up ihc 
walk toward the building. They 
noticed my plight and stopped to 
see if tliey could help me. Unnble 
lo tell them what the trouble was,, 
I could only stand there and gasp 
and lean on their extended arms 
for support. Seeing mc gasp for 
air, they were probably as frigh- 

Soon a young lady appeared 
and was hurried inside lo get 
help. She could not have sum- 
moned more capable people for, 
very quickly, there emerged from 
the building two men whom I 
recognized as Dr. Gottlieb from 
the Biology Department and Dr. 
O'Shawnessay of the Dental Clinic. 

Dr. Gottlieb correcdy diagnosed 
my symptoms immediately and 
ordered oxygen lo be brought. 
Within seconds somebody pro- 
duced a portable oxygen unit and 
I was breathing deeply of the 
pure, sweet lasting gaseous chem- 
ical. Dr. O'Shawnessay was so 
solicitous that he personally ivcnt 
lo the parking lot and drove my 
car to tlie delivery entrance so it 
would be close and warm when I 
could safely resume my normal 

Another department now be- 
came involved and should be 
commended: a department that 
we usually take for granted or, 
occasionally, cuss ot for its an- 
noying habit of passing out park- 
ing tickets. I refer to the Depart- 
ment of Safety and Security. With- 
in minutes after my trouble be- 
gan this officer had two officers 
in the area ready to rush me to 
the hospital should the need arise. 

There was another young lady 
whom I particularly remember. 
Her name was Sue and she stayed 
at my side almost the entire time. 
I remember that, standing there 
in twenty degree temperature in 
□ hght snow, she slipped out of 
her coat and tried lo put it around 
my shoulders! 

An experience such as this 
leaves a person pretty much phy- 
sically and emotionally drained 
hut, upon reflection, my one out- 
standing obsen'otion is the con- 
firmation of a suspicion I have 
had for some time: there are 
some damn fine people around 
this campus. 

Gratefully, 
Kenneth Warner 



A special tlianks is due to Of- 
ficer Warnock and Officer Bam- 
hart ifor aiding a damsel in 
distress. Dead batteries from leav- 
ing on car lights are common in 
our parking lot. Our Safety and 
Security officers deserve a special 
commendation for helping a dim- 
willed student

Labor-Militant Mitchell 
Cries For Change 



H. L. MitcheU, referred to in 
the "New York Times" as "one of 
the m09l respcctd labor militants 
in ihe South," spoke al In- 
diana University at Fort Wayne, 
December 10. The address, en- 
titled, "Protest as on Instrument 
of Social Change," was scheduled 
for 8 p.ra. in Room 107 ot the 
campus here. Mitchell's special 
appearance in Fort Wayne was be- 
ine sponsored by the Indiana Uni- 
versity Department of History and 
ivas free and open to the public. 

Co-Founder of STFU 
An almost legendary figure in 
the organized labor movement, 
Mitchell discussed efforts to or- 
eanize the nation's farm workers 
and contemporary developments 
in organized labor in the South. 
Mitclicll was co-founder of tbe his- 
toric Southern Tenant Farmers 
Union compo^d of black and 
white cotton plantation workers in 
tbe 1930's. The STFU was the 
first to develop and use non-vio- 
lent methods in strikes, picketing 
and mass demonstrations. Accord- 



ing to some historians, the demon- 
5trations by the organization con- 
stituted a prologue to the protest 
movement of today. 

3 Followers Jailed 
Mitchell currently is engaged 
ill a campaign to unionize sugar 
cane plantation workers in Lou- 
biana last summer to live and 
work with an equal number of 
plantation workers. The project 
created a stir in tbe cane fields 
and three students wrc jailed for 
trespass. The incident led Mitchell 
to comment in the press, "It is a 
sad commentary when three young 
men can go to the moon to e.\pIorc 
tbe universe and three equally 
dedicated men cannot even go to 
a corporation -owned plantation to 
help their fellow men." 

Agricultural Representative 
Mitchell presently is the agri- 
cultural representative of the Am- 
algamated Meat Cutlers and But- 
cher Workmen of North America. 
For 12 years, he was president of 
the National Agricultural Workers

Double Overtime Dazzler Brings 
Loss to Victory Hungry I.U.-P.U. 



by Darreil Pamin 

DrumB rumbled in the pre- (tonic 
period, and George Williams' In- 
dians had war paint on. The 
Boiler-Hooniers had their biiskci- 
bnll machine purring. It pave all 
ihe appearances of a Emooth run- 
ning Ford Falcon pitted against 
a Dodge Chorper. At the jump of 
the baU. the cars' guise was shat- 
tered. A team called the Hum biers 
appeared. 

I.U.-P.U. pulled off thd line 
] 7-13. Walking away 26-17, a war 
club struck Indiana-Purdue's Ross 
Gick. Fighling for a rebound, bo- 
dy contact got heavy under the 
boards, and he crashed to the 
floor. With a hadly sprained ankle, 
he was forced to sit out the rest 
of the panie. 

With Gick out. and 8:00 re- 
maining, the Indians goUoped 
hack tying the score at 30-30. 
Altman's learn readjusted as 
George Williams flnuck ahead 38- 
35. With 56 seconds left. I.U.- 
P.U. hit on two (juick steals to 
lake a 39-38 half time lead. 

As the huiY.VT sounded for the 
second half. The Bo iler-Ho osiers' 
wings were flaping with desire 
for a irin. But the battle was to he 
pulsating the rest of the way. At 
5:27 into the period, the Indians 
i^lilied in front 49-43. But llie 
Boiler-Hoosiors raised the bidding 
to 57-56 at 10:54. 

^th 3:00 left in the game. 
George Williams became second 
shadows to I.U.-P.U., and moved 
to a 77-72 advantage. Then, ihe 
I.U.-P.U. five gave storming back 
and tied the score 81-all with 45 
seconds remaining. 

It was the Indians ball out of 
bounds with 27 seconds left Then 
lighbiing struck, Indiana-Purdue's 
Jim Roulhicr erected a ivall in 
front of the Indians Boh Pruilt, 
who was trying to get the ball 
in bounds. But Prui» could not 
find a hole in the wall. Not even 
a erack. Losing his cool, Pruilt 
blasted the basketball into Routh- 
iora' chest, decking him to tlie 
floor. Referee's whistles screamed, 
and Pruitt was called on a double

Old Lady Victory 

Sometimes Stood Up 
On Blind Date 



by Darreil Parmn 
Up the down staircase! Some 
thought it was down ihe up stair- 
case, but not so. Old lady victory 
for I.U.-P.U. is a lady loaded 
down ivith parcels in a shopping 
center. Unable to see ahead, she 
tries lo go up ihe doivn escalator. 
Packages fly,' — split open. Old 
lady victory picks herself up in a 
miffed, bil musfed, and quite 
mad mailer. 

Old lady victory is a spirit in- 
side of athletes in every sport. 
Sometimes she's called menial 
toughness. But she's a wonderful 
gal to have around, no matter 
what name an athlete knoivs her 
by. 

In the minds of Indiana-Pur- 
due basketball players she is 
something special. She's the wo- 
man they imagine themselves 
walking hand in hand ivith on 
California's sandy beaches. Coach 
Altman, and his assistant coach 
Skelton, have a long standing 
blind dale for the whole team 
arranged with her. The team.

While their car was in the 
garage in the p re-seas on, work 
was slow and difficult. Passing 
drilU, one-on-one drilU, zone and 
man-to-man defense work was 
rushed. As it slood, the car would 
never have passed the Safely In- 
spection. Pre-season work-out was 
about two weeks too short because 
of early carded games. The mo- 
chinc pulled from the garage out 
of tune, hardly running. As a 
mechanic, coach Altman knew 
ihey weren't ready yet. 

In [he first game ai Spring Ar- 
bor, the offense sputtered and the 
fan belt broke. The coordination 
of working the clutch and accele- 
rator was strictly heginncr, as the 
defense jerked and sometimes

With all the mechanical pro- 
gress, one thing still doesn't work, 
or should 1 say five things. Tliose 
five things are the spark plugs, 
the five men who are on the 
playing floor. Sometimes they fire 
in perfect order, but even when 
they do, victory can not be had. 
The reason is simple: they don't 
want to win bad enough. The 
thougtil of winning crossed their 
minds only once this season. 



Against St. Francis they were 
within four points, 51-47 in the . 
East ten minutes, but they were 
behind 51-17 in desire and belief 
ihey could win. 

The radiance of old lady vie 
tory is tremendous to behold. But 
she doesn't just walk into an alh- 
kte's mind. He has to go to her 
with belief in himself or else he 
will never find her. 

And that's the way it is, this 
spnrLs week in 1969.
