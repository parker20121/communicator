In order to improve the efficiency 



Program has 
variety, status 

By JOHN CRONIN 
Staff Writer 

Approved by the faculty senate in 
1981, the Honors Program was in- 
stituted by IPFW and is directed by 
Georgia Ulmschneider, pre-law 
adviser. 

The Honors Program had a rocky 
start due to disagreements between 
the sociology department and the 
Honors Program itself. Members of 
the sociology department were 
unavailable for comment. 

The program offers a wide variety 
of classes from psychology to litera- 
ture and others. These courses offer 
a greater variety of materials and 
instructional techniques than the 
basic introductory courses offer. 

In order to t&gt;e eligible to partici- 
pate in the Honors Program, the 
student must meet one or more re- 
quirements. The student must take 
at least 12 credit hours and achieve 
and a grade point average of 3.3 on a 
four-point scale or 5,3 on a sbc-point 
scale, rank in the top 10 percent of 
his high school class, score 600 in 
verbal or math on the SAT, have a 
combined SAT score of 1100, or 
obtain the permission of the 
instructor. 

Upon graduation, the participant 
completing at least 16 credit hours of 
honors courses and a senior project 
will receive an honors certificate, 
Ulmschneider encourages people to 
participate in the Honors Program. 
Even if they do not intend to acquire 
the honors certificate, the honors 
courses claim to offer an enriching 
experience. 

Ulmschneider established the 
program t&gt;ecause she wanted to 
"open opportunities that IPFW stu- 
dents might not have had and give 
them a better shot at getting into 
graduate schools." 

Most colleges liave honors pro- 
grams. Upon application to graduate 
school, the tioards pay particular at- 
tention to the type of courses a stu- 
dent has pariicipated in. Honors 
courses may give some students an 
edge In the selection process. 

Some of Rhonda Ransopher's suc- 
cess in reaching the semifinals in the 
national Harry S. Truman Scholar- 
ship Program is attributed to the 
honors courses she has taken at 
IPFW. 



and availability of campus parking, 
she suggested that all 30 parking 
meters in lot il, between Neff Hall 
and the Classroom Medical Building, 
he removed, and that this lot be 
designated exclusively as A parking. 
She also proposed lot 6, next to the 
library, be made one-way around the 
parking islands and be used for B 
parking. 

In addition, since the campus pohce 
favor centralizing the parking meters, 
seven additional meters could be 
added to lot 10, next to the river. 
However, some feel the campus police 
might not support this plan because 
the overall reduction of parking 
meters on campus would translate 
into less revenue for the police 
department. 

The student senate voted unani- 
mously to accept Sam Palazzolo as a 
student senator. Palazzolo, a junior, is 
majoring in accounting. He said he 
joined the student senate to t&gt;e in- 
volved in student affairs on campus. 

The student senate also voted to 
present the Black Collegian Caucus 
and the Minority Affairs Administra- 
tion $395 to cover expenses related to 
sending a five-person delegation to a 
leadership conference in Louisville, 
KY.

News Editor 

The lU Faculty Board of Review has 
heard Pat Ashton's appeal of the uni- 
versity's tenure denial. The board 
heard arguments from both the soci- 
ology professor and the university 
Wednesday afternoon and Thursday 
morning, Feb, 24 and 25. The board 
has 30 days to make a 
recommendation to Chancellor Tom 
Wallace, 

Mark GlaQuinta, a Fort Wayne at- 
torney, represented Ashton. In his 
opening statement GiaQuinta said, 
"The Ashton case represents pro- 
cedure gone awry. The positive 
recommendations of Ashton's col- 
leagues, the department chair and the 
division-committee were all dis- 
regarded, and decision can only be 
seen as the whim of the reviewer or 
the flip of a coin." 

Ashton had sought promotion and 
tenure. The sociology department's 
committee voted 3-0 in favor of both 
and the chair of the sociology de- 
partment concurred. The Arts and 
Letters Committee voted B-0 In favor 
of tenure but 4-4 against promotion. 
The dean of Arts and Letters sup- 
ported tenure but not promotion. The 
campus-wide committee voted 6-1 
against tenure and 7-0 against pro- 
motion. Neither the chancellor nor the 
vice-chancellor supported either case. 
Ashton appealed only the tenure 
denial. 

GiaQuinta's first witness was Mike 
Downs, associate professor of political 
science. Downs said Chancellor 
Wallace had confused the standards of 
promotion with tenure. 

In a letter dated Sept. 23, 1987, 
written by Wallace to Ashton, Wallace 
wrote, "In my view, the total record 
of your file is at t&gt;est borderline for 
promotion and/or tenure," 

Downs said, "Promotion in rank 
requires the candidate demonstrate 
excellence in teaching, research, or 
service and competence in the un- 
claimed areas. They are similar but 
not identical." 

Downs sat on the Arts and Letters 
unit committee and said he voted to 
recommend tenure but to deny 
promotion. 

"The thing that makes me angry is 
that I viewed promotion and tenure as 
two different things and judged them 
accordingly, ft annoys me to tiave 
someone pretend 1 was saying the 



same thing as both. We (the com- 
mittee) wrote two recommendations 
and voted two different ways," Downs 
said. 



"The thing that makes me 
angry is that I viewed 
promotion and tenure as two 
different things and judged 
them accordingly. It annoys 
me to have someone pre- 
tend I was saying the same 
thing as both. " 

MIko Downs

pollilcDl scion CO 

Downs said if he had to do the whole 
thing over he would vole for pro- 
motion. "I was very persuaded that 
Professor Ashton deserved to be 
tenured, The greater good would have 
been achieved even If I had to scale 
down what I think should be the 
standard for promotion." 

Downs said denying Ashton tenure 
broke all precedents, "I hope no one 
wants this case to be 
precedent-making," Downs said. 

After being denied tenure, Ashton's 
work was evaluated by two sets of 
outside reviewers. Among the re- 
viewers was Herbert Cans, who is a 
sociology professor at Columbia Uni- 
versity and the president of the 
American Sociological Association. 
Gans said, "Professor Ashton has 
done more than most universities re- 
quire and clearly deserves to be given 
tenure. ' ' 

Downs said the outside reviews were 
valuable, "The reason we ask for 
them is to show that maybe we have a 
standard shared at other places, 
shared by the profession at large and 
not just by us at this place, at this 
time." 

Downs said the American Associ- 
ation of University Professors had 
taken the position that the substance 
of a candidate's tenure case was best 
decided at the department level, 

"One reason the decision at a lower 
level should be more authoritative is 
that the department is more familiar 
with a candidate's tangible and in- 
tangible asseLs as well as with the 
literature in the field. Also, the lower 
committee has more lime to give the 
case a thorough examination."

Flynt vs. Falwell 

Supreme Court thanked 
for upholding freedom 



It is being hailed as a victory for 
political cartoonists and satirists 
and reaffirms the First Amend- 
ment to the Constitution, which 
guarantees freedom of speech. 

What IS at issue in this case 
in not hght-versus-wrong. good- 
'.versus-evil. religion-versus- 

■ pornography, or even liberalism- 
versus-conservalism. The over- 

'riding issue is (hat the First 
Amendment supporting freedom 

■ of speec h was upheld. 

■ In a unanimous decision last 
Wednesday, the United States Su- 
preme Court overturned a lower 

. court ruling that had awarded 
damages to the Reverend Jerry 
Falwell. The suit stemmed from a 
parody of the television evangelist 
which appeared in Larry Flynl's 
; publication, Hustler Magazine. 
The parody, which appeared in 
the November 1983 and March 1984 
issues of Hustler, made references 
to Folwell's having an incestuous 
relationship with his mother and 
being drunk while giving sermons. 
"Not to be taken seriously" was 
written in small print at the bottom 
of the page. 

' In the original suit, filed in 
Roanoke, Virginia, in 1984, Falwell 
claimed damages totalling $4!i mil- 
lion for libel, invasion of privacy 
and emotional distress. The lower 
court awarded Falwell $200,000 in 



damages for emotional distress but 
nothing for the libel charge. The 
fourth United States Circuit Court 
upheld the lower court decision. 

The Supreme Court, in an eleven- 
page decision, said the ad was 
satirical and rejected Falwell's 
claim that the parody was libelous 
just because Falwell considered it 
outrageous. 

What is at issue in this case is not 
right-versus-wrong, good-versus- 
evil, religion-versus-pornography 
or even liberalism-versus con- 
servatism. The overriding issue is 
that the First Amendment, sup- 
porting freedom of speech, was 
upheld. 

If the nation's highest court had 
upheld the lower court ruling, it 
would have declared open-season 
on every political cartoonist and 
satirist. Any artist or writer creat- 
ing an imaginary situation in- 
volving a political figure or celeb- 
rity for the sake of presenting satir- 
ical opinion could be held liable if 
Falwell's charges had prevailed. 

The Supreme Courl should be 
commended for their ruling for 
upholding one of the most im- 
portant parts of our Constitution, 
freedom of speech, and for allowing 
political cartoonists and satirists 
the freedom to voice their opinion. 
The media as a whole will benefit 
from the ruling, since it protects 
them from emotional-distress law 
suits. 



Honors program good idea 
to help exceptional achievers 



Citing IPFW's Honors Program 
as elitist, some departments ap- 
pear hesitant to prepare honors 
courses of their own. This obstruc- 
tion may cripple the program, par- 
ticularly if this opinion dis- 
seminates throughout the faculty 
and student body, 

The Honors Program, offering 
under half a dozen courses this 
spring, is designed for top-notch 
students who rank in the lop 10 
percent of their graduating class, 
score at least HOC on the SAT and 
maintain a high grade point 
average. A certificate Is earned af- 
ter the student completes 18 honors 
credits. 

According to the Bulletin, It 
"serves serious students who want 
the challenge of stretching their 



Special treatment is not limited 
to hlgh-achlevers. Remedial 
courses also discriminate ac- 
ademically, but they rarely receive 
the' amount of criticism honors 
courses do. Both types of courses 
cater to students who would feel 
displaced in a regular academic 
setting. 

The recent success of Rhonda 
Ronsopher, Honors Program 
member and semifinalist in the 
Harry S, Truman Scholarship Pro- 
gram, demonstrates the im- 
portance of encouraging excep- 
tional students to reach their 
potential. 

Since honors courses are more 
challenging, some students receive 
lower grades in them than they 
might in an equivalent academic 




intellectual potential." Con- 
scientious critics should be com- 
mended for being concerned about 
contributing to class differences 
and segregation on campus. How- 
ever, honors courses do not pro- 
mote either. 

Every student has been in a class 
with (hscipline problems, an in- 
efficient instructor or classmates 
with no apparent desire to learn. 
The Honors Program provides an 
alternative. Because the classes 
are smaller, students receive more 
individual attention from profes- 
sors, the class is not delayed by 
slower students and the learning 
experience is enhanced. How can 
anyone object to such positive 
achievements? 



class. Such students apparently feel 
the risk of getting a lower grade is 
preferable to stagnating in a slower 
class. 

The only elite In the Honors Pro- 
gram are the unrestrained profes- 
sors who get the opportunity to 
guide a class to its fullest potential. 
Honors students are mature enough 
not to allow their status to engiJf 
them; considering how "eggheads" 
were regarded in high school, 
should ordinary students really feel 
threatened? 

Anyone who has condemned the 
program should reconsider his 
stand and encourage these l&gt;ene- 
ficial courses. Unfair criticism only 
succeeds in taking the "honor" out 
of the Honors Program.

Parking problem 

TothcEdllor: 

In response lo the un- 
signed letter entitled 
"Parking Perfect," which 
appeared in the Feb. II 
issue of the Communicator, 
I would like lo further ad- 
dress IPFW's parking 
problem. 

The auUior of "Forking 
Perfect" does have a legit- 
imate argument, but he 
needs to consider the entire 
picture of this campus's 
parking problems. I agree 
that a very large portion of 
IPFW's parking problems 
lies with the student body, 
but even students who at- 
tempt to resolve their own 
personal parking problems 
are still faced with an un- 
resolvablc problem. 

For instance, I own a 
reasonably new car and put 




forth my best effort to 
prevent door dings from 
marring up the side of my 
car. I park in the very last 
row of the Athletic Center 
parking lot each day and 
walk considerably farther 
than anyone else parked in 
that lot. There is always at 
least 60 feet between my 



car and the next closest 
car. Clearly I have taken 
the parking problem into 
my own hands, but the uni- 
versity police insist on issu- 
ing my vehicle a parking 
citation if my car is parked 
sideways. 

The university police 
claim that I am depriving 
other students of piarking 
space. This has happened 
twice this year. Clearly this 
parking problem is pro- 
voked by the same organi- 
zation said to protect my 
vehicle while at IPFW. 

Even though 1 have 
chosen to walk considerably 
farther than anyone else, I 
still have a parking prob- 
lem with the university 
police. So am I to be con- 
sidered a lazy student? 1 
think not. 

Even though 1 have at- 
tempted to resolve my own 



parking problem, and I am 
not a lazy student. 1 still am 
critiqued daily on how 
straight 1 can park my car. 
I hope this letter helps to 
warn other new car owners 



that even if you are parked 
in the back row. the uni- 
versity police will be look- 
ing for a 90-degree parking 
job.

Skating 'Bad' 

Katarina brings East and West together 



By NATALIE ALCOX 

Managing Editor 

and 

JOHN AUGUSTVNIAK 

Copy Editor 

It's over for another four 
years, and the spirit of the 
United Stales is flagging 
but not broken. The 1988 
Winter Olympics netted the 
United States two gold 
medals, one silver medal, 
and three bronze medals. 
The amount of medals won 
is less significant than the 
fact the United States par- 
ticipated in the Olympics. 
Unfortunately some closed - 
minded people feet winning 
is all that matters. 

To ease their egos they 
have come up with ration- 
alizations to explain Uie 
United States' losses Al- 
legations of professional 
status; unethical medical 
practices, such as athletes 
giving themselves trans- 
fusions to increase me- 
tabolism; and charges of 



unscrupulous officials in- 
evitably surface each time 
the events are held. 
Whether or not such far- 
fetched speculations are 
accurate is superfluous; 
athletes and the public must 
assume the games are fair. 

The Olympics have suc- 
ceeded where peace organ- 
izations such as the League 
of Nations have failed. Ath- 
letes from the smallest 
country in Africa are 
treated with the same re- 
spect as those from the 
United States or the Soviet 
Union Delegates in suits 
and ties cannot fully com- 
prehend other cultures in 
the same way athletes on 
the field perceive their 
competition. 

Isn't it possible the win- 
ning athletes won on their 
own merit? The United 
States cannot possibly win 
every compeUtion it enters 
By sheer probability the 
United States, as only one 



of many countries which 
competes, should expect the 
odds of winning to be pro- 
portional to the numl&gt;er of 
participants. 

The Olympics have in re- 
cent years strayed from 
their creators' original in- 
tent. Mass camaraderie and 
the spirit of competition 
have given way to com- 
mercialization. The events 
are interrupted by ads for 
beer and cars. 

East German figure- 
skater Katarina Witt dis- 
played the best inter- 
cultural skills in her 
closing-ceremony perform- 
ance. Witt, clad in a black 
leather silver-studded 
jacket, skated to Michael 
Jackson's "Bad." bringing 
E^t and West together and 
the crowd to its feet. Tu- 
multuous applause followed. 
Such an action represents 
the true spirit of the games, 
but it is too often absent. 



It is too much to hope 
things will improve by the 
Summer Olympics in Seoul, 
but unless the games l)egin 
to return to their original 
premise, they may die out, 



as they did in ancient 
Greece. The games mean 
far more to the world than 
two weeks of prime-time 
programming. 




Is there really a Students' Government on this campus? 



The Communicator 




By LILLIAN R. LYON 

Edilor-In-ChicI 
Last week The Commu- 
nicator printed "Voices." a 
pictorial campus survey 
highlighting a question 
about an issue or topic in 
tbe news The subject was 
Students' Government, and 
the question asked whether 
the students polled thought 
Students' Government was 
doing a good job. 

Commentary 

Well, the results were a 
bil mind-boggling. Though 
only eight students were 
featured lit would be im- 
possible and impracUcal to 
give a significantly larger 
sampling), their answers 
can generally l&gt;e construed 
as representing those a 



majority would give, and in 
some cases the answers 
provide a look into the 
minds of the student body. 

If this were the case last 
week, then the students of 
this campus are much more 
apathetic than anyone ever 
imagined. Only one of the 
eight students recognized 
that Students' Government 
is indeed attempting to help 
meet Uie needs of IPFW 
students. Does this mean 
only one-eighth of the stu- 
dent body believes this'? It 
may seem so, but to think 
that some of the other re- 
plies represent a majority 
of opinion on this campus is 
a bit scary. 

Do we really not know 
that there is a Students' 
Government on our cam- 
pus, as one student com- 



mented? Do we really not 
understand what a member 
of Students' Government— a 
student representative- 
does, for the student body? 
Do we really never hear of 
the work Students' Gov- 
ernment does? 

Aside from these far- 
fetched ideas, two students 
expressed the desire for 
more student activities. 
This area does fall under 
the "jurisdiction" of Stu- 
dents' Government, and the 
body does manage to 
schedule a few student ac- 
tivities in between writing 
and passing bills and reso- 
lutions that 00 one knows 
about. 

There is an entire section 
of Students' Government 
designated for student ac- 



tivities. It is no surprise to 
leam it is called, you 
guessed it, the Student Ac- 
tivities Board. SAB, as it is 
referred to. plans events for 
students, such as the Mid- 
day Diversion, which takes 
place in the Fort at noon 
every Monday that school is 
in session, and the various 
SAB dances at the Hoag- 
land Hayloft. 

Students' Government is 
not the only organization 
responsible for scheduling 
student activities. Two 
women's fraternities exist 
on the IPFW campus, in 
addition to one men's fra- 
ternity. Plans are in the 
works to add not only an- 
other men's fraternity but 
another women's fraternity 
as well. 



Organizations like the 
International Students Or- 
ganization, the Black Col- 
legian Caucus, the Cercle 
Francais. the math club, 
the psychology club, the 
accounting club, and more 
are open to interested stu- 
dents. In addition, there is a 
strong business fratermty

If these fail to stimulate 
interest, then there is al- 
ways Students' Government 
itself. If you feel there 
aren't enough activities to 
suit you, then do something 
about it. Join Students' 
Government and make a 
difference. 

It has never made any 
sense to point out problems, 
and not Cry to rectify them 
when the chance arises.

Reception at Canterbury 

Japanese students come to Fort Wayne 




Three Japanese sludents were the guests of the Student Activities Board at a recepllon 
held at the Canterbury Green Clubhouse. The trio is touring the United States as part or 
winning an essay contest. Pictured from left to right are Tokiko Inoue. Masayoshi Hayashi, 
and Kaori Kondo (photo by John Augustynlak). 



Ashton- 



{Continued from page 1.) 
The university's case was 
presented by Van 
Coufoudakis, assistant dean 
of the faculty, and Cliff 
Travis, university counsel 
forru. 

"The university 
and the chancellor 
understand the dif- 
ference between 
tenure and 

promotion. " 

—Van Coufoudakis 

—assistant dean 
ot (acullv 

Coufoudakis challenged 
the importance of the out- 
side reviews. "The outside 
review process is not re- 
quired by either the lU 
handbook or the chancellor 
but was a mutual agree- 
ment between the chancel- 
lor and Professor Ashton. 
Evaluations cannot be a 
substitute for the tenure 
process but can only be one 
step in a tenure dossier. 
The chancellor is not bound 
by an extraordinary pro- 
cedure," Coufoudakis said. 

Coufoudakis cited cases in 
which the university had 
granted tenure but not 
promotion. "The university 
and the chancellor under- 
stand the difference be- 
tween tenure and promo- 
tion," Coufoudakis said. 

Coufoudakis also said the 
university had followed all 
specified procedures. "The 
Ashton case was judged on 
its own merits; had he 
submitted only a tenure 
case, the result would have 
been the same." 



The university presented 
nd witnesses, but the board 
itself called Wallace to tes- 
tify Thursday morning. 
George Bullion, a member 
of the Iward, asked Wallace 
atwut the outside reviews. 

"The outside reviewers 
had looked at his total ca- 
rter performance, while I 
feel that it is important to 
look at his rate of produc- 
tion while he was here at 
IPFW," Wallace said. 

"During the time he was 
here he had only two pub- 
lications. I began to get the 
sense he had done some 
things in the past, but the 
continual rate of production 
had dropped prior to mov- 
ing on to tenure track." 

Marge Souers, another 
board member, asked 
Wallace how he viewed the 
relationship between 
promotion and tenure. 

"What I was trying to say- 
is that I considered the de- 
gree of reaction to a pro- 
motion and tenure case. 
When a group cannot be 
positive on promotion, it 
casts a negative flavor on 
the tenure case. I think 
promotion and tenure are 
clearly linked." 

Bullion asked Wallace 
how much weight he gave 
to the various committees. 

Wallace said, "I did not 
weigh the department 
committee too heavily. Of 
the three people on that 
committee, two were on 
terminal contract and one 
was coming up for tenure." 
"In my last job, which I 
held for eight years, I saw 
departments where, as long 
as you had a warm body, 



you got a positive 
recommendation." 

Wallace's remarks did not 
please Downs who, along 
with GiaQuinta, presented 
the closing arguments for 
Ashton. "Now that 1 have 
the benefit of the chancel- 
lor's testimony, I can say 
the letter he wrote is even 
more a cause for confi^ion 
than I thought yesterday." 

"The chancellor has come 
up with new standards, 
such as rate ot productivity. 
In my view the chancellor's 
letter is an embarrassment 
I think the chancellor might 
admit the letter is an em- 
barrassment to him." 

But Travis, who pre- 
sented the closing ar 
guments for the university, 
said the decision to deny 
Ashton tenure was not 
based on erroneous infor 
mation, improper consid 
eration or failure to follow 
specified procedures.

Toktko Inoue, Masayoshi 
Hayashi and Kaori Kondo. 
three Japanese students 
who won an essay contest 
and a 14-day trip to the 
United Stales, were given a 
reception at the Canterbury 
Green Country Club FYiday 
evening, Feb 27. The trio 
were in Fort Wayne only six 
hours at the time of the 
gathering, which was spon- 
sored by the Student Ac- 
tivities Board. IPFWs In- 
ternational Students' Or- 
ganization and the Fort 
Wayne Sister Cities 
Committee. 

Inoue, a senior and polit- 
ical science major at Keio 
University, submitted a 
winning essay on U.S.- 
Japan trade friction Her 
first impressions of the 
United States are its large 
size and friendly citizens. 

"Japan is becoming too 
powerful," Inoue said, rec- 
ommending that the 
country play a more im- 
portant part in the Third 
World. The high Japanese 
agricultural tariff was de- 
signed to protect the do-

mestic market, she said, 
but "The government 
should open the market 
more and more." The Jap- 
anese people hate wars, slie 
said, and it's loo hard to 
build up de tenses. 

Masayoshi Hayashi, a 
junior majoring in inter- 
national politics at Aoyama 
University, visited the 
United States once t&gt;etore 
His essay addresses the 
way people influence their 
government. 

Hayashi said Japanese 
students have become 
"Americanized." They 
know a tot about American 
music and regularly watch 
MTV and CNN. 

He echoes Inoue's belief 
that Japan, a closed mar- 
ket, should be opened for 
foreign products. Assessing 
Japan's low defense budget, 
he said, "Other countries 
are sensitive to increased 
defense." Hayashi noted 
that while political relations 
between the United States 
and Japan are good, 
economic relations are 
worsening, 

Kaori Kondo, a junior 
majoring in American lit- 
erature at Ochanomizu 



Women's College, chose 
"US,— Japanese Ties in 
Literature" as her essay 
topic She said the United 
Stales is "alive, exciting...! 
love it!" Her favorite 
American authors are 
Bdgar Allan Poe and Emily 
Dickinson 

[n Japan "the status of 
women is getting better and 
better but is not good 
enough yet," Hondo said. 
"More and more women 
[ind working exciting," she 
added. 

"Many women are con- 
cerned with marriage," 
chimed In Innue. 

Inoue, Hayashi and Kondo 
were each presented with a 
gift, an ARCH tolc bag. 
Honored guests Mr. Ibc and 
Mr. Kilamura were given a 
replica of the decorative 



displays in the Hotel 
Indiana. 

Ibe is the managing di- 
rector of the International 
Education Center, a school 
for businessmen which as- 
sists both American and 
Japanese business people. 

Kitamura, Introduced as 
senior editor of one of 
Japan's largest news- 
papers, humorously re- 
torted, "The largest Jap- 
anese newspaper. We're 
living in a capitalist soci- 
ety." The Yomiuri Shimbun 
has a dally circulation of 
live million and reaches 
over nine million on the 
weekend. Kitamura likened 
his newspaper to the New 
York Times. 

He said he first heard 
Fort Wayne was "a t&gt;cauti- 
ful ritv n^chiirchea," 



Young C. Chen, an IPFW 
biology faculty member, 
was available to help the 
students with translation 
and introductions. Gabriel 
Delobbe represented the 
Sister Cities Committee. 

After the reception Inoue, 
Hayashi and Kondo at- 
tended the IPFW men's 
tiasketball game. Each of 
the students stayed with a 
different host family said 
Marian Adair, who hosted 
one student for his three 
days in Fort Wayne. 

After observing W. H. 
Tsai's sociology lecture last 
Monday morning, the three 
students continued their 14- 
day tour of the U.S. 

Over 750 Japanese stu- 
dents entered the essay 
competition.

verted the free throw to 
once again give the 'Dons a 
seven-point lead. 

But the Greyhounds

Bv CHRIS ELLIOTT 

Staff Writer 
Although basketball is 
known as a game for giants. 
Ihe small guard has ticcome 
the trend of the '8as The 
fad has caught on at IPF^. 
TVo Mastodon stars, 5-fool- 
8-lnch Lawrence Jordan and 
5- foot- 10-inch Sieve Bard, 
are the school's version of 
the craze. 

The duo makes up for 
their lack of size with 
quickness and ball control 
and have been a major 
reason for the team's 
sudden turn-around this 
season. 

Jordan thrives on pass- 
ing. He has registered 15 or 
more assists three times 
this season, Including a 
school record of 17 against 
Bellarmine Saturday, Feb. 
27, Just two nights earlier, 
he recorded 15 against 
Indianapolis. 

Bard is frequently on the 
receiving end of Jordan's 
pass wizardry. He is 
currently on a hot streak 
from three-point range, hit- 
ting at leasl one in 21 con- 
secutive games Bard may 
sizzle from the three-point 
stripe but he's as cool as a 
Canadian snowstorm when 
shooting from the charity 
stripe. He hit 39 straight 
free throws up to Ihe 
Thursday. Feb, 25 game 
against Indianapolis, His 
secret? "I just do three 
dribbles, lake a deep breath 
and shoot," he explains. 

Andy Piazza, head coach, 
feels the duo's play is vital 
lo the team's success, 

"They both have to play 
well for us to win," he said. 
"They respect each other 
on the court and are good 
friends off the court." 

Jordan and Bard feel 
strongly that heighl is not 
an issue. "We jump just as 
high as other players. We 
have an advantage because 



we're quicker," said 
Jordan, 

Jordan played for IPFW 
during the 19B5-li6 season 
but transferred to Danville 
Junior College last season 
for academic reasons He 
then returned to the Masto- 
dons Ihis year to become a 
memlwr of Piazza's run- 
and-gtm squad. Jordan did, 
however, get off to a shaky 
slarl initially, 

"Lawrence suffered 
growing pains of leurnlng 
my system at first," said 
Piazza. "He's been making 
a better effort lately to 
accept the way our system 
works." 

Dard played for Piazza al 
Delta Junior College last 
season, averaging over 20 
points per game, He then 
travelled with Piazza lo 
ippw thon became

"We help each other a

(Jordan) gets down on 
himself 1 help him out, and 
he docs the same for me," 

The friendship has proven 
valuable on the court. They
