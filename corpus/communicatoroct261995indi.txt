News FJitur 

Since Ihc Republicans look conirol of 
Congress, ilic budget has become a lop pri- 
ority on Capiiol Hill. In Die Contract with 
America released last September, 
Republicans promised Americans a zero 
dencit spending level. 

The baillc between the Oval Office and 
Congress is sbll continuing and is expecicd 
to continue for some lime. In his budget 
proposal to Congress, president Clinton 
focuseil on raising the standard of living for 
all Americans, rebuilding America's com- 
muniiics, projeclJng American leadership. 



and making the government work. 

"By itself, the Federal Goverrtmeni can- 
not rebuild America's communities. What it 
can do is give communities some of the 
tools and resources to address their prob- 
lems in their own way." said Clinton. "My 
national service program provides incen- 
tives for Americans of all ages to volunteer 
their services in local communities across 
the country. 3nd cam money for their own 
education " 

Republican leaders, however, said the 
president's plan would not eliminate the

posed budget cuts are not outrageous.

the floor this week. The content includes 
cutbacks on student loans, welfare, health 
care and farm programs. 

"With this package, Republicans are ful- 
filling our pledge to the American people 
We have formulated a fair and meaningful 
plan for reshaping government and elimi-

Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio

Some people have 
deemed our genera- 
tion as the generation

Many IPFW students 
said they have moti- 
vation to speak out 
when it hurts people 
in need, "There are 
ways to cut the bud- 
get without cutting 
Medicaid and educa- 
tion, like defense," 
said senior Kurt 
Fremion. 

Not all students 
agree with Fremion. 
Some say the 
Republicans are right, 

"if you wani^an education, you need to 
pay for it," said freshman Jennifer Jones. 

Alihou(;h, Mastodons, like Americans, 



"Maybe a 

third party will 

get them up 

off of their 
asses, " 

-- Fremion 



cannot seem to agree on ihc 
best way to r\in the couniry. 
they do agree that 
Generation X needs to be 
heard at the polls. 

"If you want change, 
you've got to vote," said 
freshman Greg Feaster. 

Several students fear the 
condition of the country is 
getting worse and there is 
not much light is al the end 
of the tunnel. 

"This is the first genera- 
lion that is not making as 
much as iheir parents," said 
l-remion. "We need a third 
party to shake up the 
Republicans .ind Democrats. 

As It stands now the 

Republicans and Democrats are at a stand- 
still but maybe a third parly will get them

To end the week,

Council ;innounced the 
university will host 
Diversity Week. The event is 
scheduled for March 18-23. and, 
according to the Office of the 
Chancellor, is expected to become 
an annual event. 

"We are hoping lo facilitate what 
we are hoping lo be a university 
wide event," said Jeanne Tessier 
Barone, chair of ihe Diversity Week 
Committee and instructor of com- 
munications. 

According to Barone, events are 
already in the works, but Ihe com- 
mittee is asking each department 
and some student organizations to 
offer an event, display, or lecture, 

"Every department must know of 
ways divereity is relevant to their 
subject and students." said Jcaneite 
Clausen, commillee member and 
chair of Modem Foreign Language.

community on civil-righis. The 
event is scheduled for Saturday 
afternoon during the event 

Barone said each individual 
organization or department is free 
to schedule any event without the 



eommiltee's approval, however, she 
said the group would like to orga- 
nize a calendar of events. 

"We would like to coordinate a 
master calendar, but not give 
approval for ihe events.' said 
Barone. "We are hoping to fill the 
calendar" 

"We are hoping each organiza- 
tion would look at the week in their 
own way," said Clausen. 

Patterson said the week is unique 
because it will not single out one 
particular culture. "We are not 
looking at one particular ethnic 
group," said Patterson. "We are 
looking to highlight all groups." 

According lo Patterson, the com- 
mittee is planning to announce the 
week to local schools and the com- 
munity 

" I think the administration has 
reached a level of awareness that 
might not have been there before." 
said Paiterson, 

Altijough the commitiee has not 
been given an exact budget yei, 
Barone said the committee is plan- 
ning to have limited funds to match 
dollars for events. 

Patterson and Barone are expect- 
ed to meet with the chancellor 
today to discuss the final budget. 

"I think most of the problems 
IPFW is confronted with is more 
out of ignorance," said Patterson,

November 1 begins National Native

Students' Alliance (NASA) has several 
events planned to commemorate their 
heritage and aid fellow students' under- 
standing of theu' culture 



Beginning this coming Wednesday ''"'"^"'l """^^ '" scholarships each 
the student organization will host a guest semester. The other scholarship is an 
speaker. Sally Tuide. the director of the anonymous private scholarship which 
Indiana American Indian Manpower "'^'""l' ^"'^''^ ^2,500 a year. 

In its third year, the members of 



NASA believe the month and the group 
iiscif help the community understand a 
piece of American culture. 

"If people are interested in getting 
behind the stereotypes of Native 
Americans and actually learning first 
hand about the Native American experi- 
ence, traditions and cultures, it's a good 
pLice to start." said Jehri Ncri, a member 
of NASA. "I decided to become 
involved because I saw a Native 
American group that was struggling and 
trying to establish itself." 

Members believe the organization 
helps Native Americans feel vahdated as 
citizens. "1 think it promotes respect for 
Native American culture, no matter what 
nationality," said Beeching. 

All Students, regardless of race, arc 
welcomed into NASA. "It's a good edu- 
cational experience You can learn a lot 



about a different culture," said Kathleen 
Squadriio, NASA's adviser. 

Some Native Americans believe peo- 
ple often have misconceptions about 
their culture '1 think a lot of people do 
have interests in Native American cul- 
ture and gel Ihe wrong information." 
said Luann Neri 

According lo Squadrito, one of the 
biggest problems NASA faces is finding 
a convenient time for everyone to meet.

Kind acts can boost

You may have heard about 
"Random AcLs of Kindness. " Oprah 
Winfrey has done a show about 
these simple and spontaneous good 
deeds, which arc ofieri done anony- 
mously. 

Let's say you sec a child situng 
on one of those mechanical horses 
near die doorway of a retail store, 
The eager child's mniher digs in her 
purse for a quarter but comes up 
empty. 

Perfect chance for a Random Act 
of Kindness! You just pull a quarter 
uui of your pocket, and plug it in 
the slot. You smile as you go on 
your way. 

It's all very simple. Most of the 
time we could make someone's day 
with surprisingly little effort. 

Remember ihe old siercoiype of 
the boy scout who helps ihe elderly 
lady across the street? Do these 
people really enisi? They do if wc 
are not afraid to offer an arm to 
anodier person. 

I was driving through die park- 
ing garage last week and saw a car 
with a eomplciely flat tire. I imag- 
ined how up.sci the person would be 
when he or she came back from 
class. The lucky thing was that I 
had an air compressor in my car. 1 
filled up the tire, left a note, and felt 
good as 1 drove away. 

Random Atis of Kindness can 
be the simplest thing";. You could 
share your umbrclla with someone 
when it is raining. You could give 



someone ahead of 
you in the checkout 
lane a grocery coupon 
they could use. The 
only rule is to not 
expect the person you 
help to reward you 

Yet. for some rea- 
son, the old adage. 
'What goes around 
comes around," is 
true Whether by 
divine intervention, die workings of 
karma, or for psychological rea- 
sons, we are rewarded. Not only do 
we feel good when we help some- 
one, but wc also dien find that when 
we need help ourselves, it is there 
for us. 

I know I have been fortunate 
myself when I have needed help. 
People have appeared when I had to 
push my car out of snow banks, and 
have rescued me when 1 have run 
out of gas (a few times). Once in 
New York City, someone handed 
me my wallet which 1 had unknow- 
ingly dropped. I can diink of many 
other times that people I had never 
met before, and probably would not 
meet again, did somedung kind for 
me. 

The one thing dial seems to get 
in the way of people's kindness is 
iheir fear of "strangers." Uieir ner- 
vousness at crossing the invisible 
walls we put up between us. If 
someone came out of a restroom 
with toilet paper trailing from her 
shoe, would you let her know? 

We need to break down these 
walls. Mom of the time, our fears 
are not based upon anything ratio- 
nal. I'm not talking about letting 
two six-fool men inro your house to 
use your phone when you are home 
alone at midnight. When we are on 
campus, in broad daylight, amongM 
our fellow classmates, couldn't we 
all use a lillle more kindness? Why 



Future of dorms a hazy picture 



dont you: 
■ Hold the 
door open for 
someone 
today, and 
this time, say 
hi (I know it 
sounds radi- 
cal, but stay 
with me). 

• Point out an 
empty desk 
to a class- 
mate who is 
looking for 
somewhere to 
sit in a 
crowded 
classroom. 

• Instead of 
playing 'car 
wars," let the 
other guy 
have the 
parking spot 
for once. 

• Put an anonymous appreciation 
note on your favorite instructor'.s 
office door. 

The best ideas for Random Acts 
of Kindness will pop up sponta- 
neously, however. When you sec

Silling across from ihc Gypsy woman, 
I noted the distotied image of her in die 
crystal ball between us. Her deep brown 
eyes carefully peered at me from their 
position over her pointed nose Her bony 
hands narrowed into thrcc-inch-long, 
black nails which hovered over the bluish 
ball. 

The woman's vulgarly painted lips 
parted as she leaned forward Her raspy, 
tired voice then followed, "My child, 
there arc some questions which even I 
cannot answer " 

I feared the question would forever 
bum in my soul: Will there ever be dor- 
mitories on IPFW's campus? 

The question can be traced back 
almost to the university's beginnings. 
The Indiana-Purdue Foundation at Fort 
Wayne was first established in 1958. 
Since then, students, professors, staff 
members and even administrators have 
all occasionally wondered if the com- 



muter campus would ever offer at least 
some dormitories Most students merely 
accept die situation 

The number of students has tradition- 
ally been an issue when considering the 
construction of dormitories. Slightly over 
eleven thousand studenus .mend IPIW. a 
number which is down from past years. 
"I think evemually, after there is a large 
enough demand, the school administra- 
tion will reahze the needs and 
then provide us dorms, 
said student Jennifer 
Mix, 

Having dormito- 
ries on campus would 
ease parking prob- 
lems and provide Ihe 
"college experience" 
so many students desire 
More high school seniors 
may choose IPFW 
because it could be a 
way to get away from 
mom and dad without 
leaving all securii; 




behind. 

The work of the International 
Student's Organization may also be cased 
if students from far away places were 
assured a place to live on campus. "For 
out of state students and students from 
other countries, donns would he more 
convenient." said student Renec Darger, 

Currently. studenLs have to figure out 
a living situauon. Many live at home for 
an extra few years, and may com- 
mute from other towns. Others 
live in nearby apartments, 
which can be expensive 
I opened my eyes and 
gazed at the Gypsy 
woman. Maybe expect- 
ing iin answer from her 
was like expecting to 
catch at least one green light 
ivhen you are running late 
for class. For now, IPFW 
will remain a commuter 
campus, but Ihe gypsy 
will call me if there arc 
any changes. 



notes are blowin' in the wind, 
you'll know what to do. 

It doesn't have to be Random 
Acts of Kindness Week to find out 
how good you can feel when you 
commit a kind deed. Let's boost our 
sense of community on Ihe IPFW 
campus by putting kindness into 
action.

Today is one of Ihose days

"Rob Roy" Action, rated R

passionate wife is played by

Hoy's clan, he is forced to bor- 
row money from Ihe less than 
noble Marquis of Montrose (John 
lliifi). Montrose's evil henchman 
iOi?.es Ihc opportunity to lake 
Roy's new found wealth and will 
slop ai nothing lo catch Roy. 

"French Kiss" Comedy, rated 
Ki 1 3. A hilarious movie slaning 
Meg Ryan as conservative Kale, 
who is afraid to fly, so she leis 
her fiancee (Timothy Hutlon) go

love \viih a Parisian "goddess." 
she overcomes her phobia and 
crosses Ihe ocean to try to win

cunning frenchman with a gift 
for gab and a fondness for thiev- 
ery Tills must-see exhibits Meg 
Ryan at her best, with scenes as 
memorable as those in "When

"Bask«lball Diaries" Drama. 
raicd R, The compelling, true

DiCaprio). a high school baskei-

TTiese relationships are still contro- 
versial, Misiy and Bobby continue 
lo receive criiicism and raisciJ eye- 
brows. Ii seems that the 
right to love someone and 
to be happy has restric- 
tions. One of those restric- 
tions II ID Slay with one's 
nkind. 
There have been many theories as 
10 why people are attracted lo some- 
one of another race. Some say it is 
forbidden fruil. that people always 
want something they cannot 
have. Others conclude that it is 
the fascination of having 
something different from the 
norm. 

interracial couples like Misty 
and Bobby Just want to be 
accepted. They are in love with 
each other's inner beings, 
not the color of 
their skin. TTicy 
arc tired of /T 
being stereo- Wt&gt;-^~ 
typed. What ever 
happened to the 
belief that love has no face? 

When Bobby met Misty in histo- 
ry class last fall, he fell in love widi 
her mind (and how she chewed her 
gum), tie finally got the courage to 
ask her out, and they have been 
together ever since. They have over- 
come obstacles thai have only made 
iheir relationship stronger Misty's 



family wasn't too fond of her having 
a black boyfriend. They msisicd that 
11 was jusi a phase she was going 
through Bobby's friends joked and 
diagnosed him wiih having jungle 
fever. Their friends called ihcm 
crazy. That was a year ago Bobby 
and Misty insist that iheir relation- 
ship has nothing lo do with what 
everyone else thinks If Misiy was 
just simply going through a phase, it 
would have been over a long time 
ago. And if Bobby simply wanted 
something different, he 
would not have stayed 
with her so long. 

Love is defined in 
Webster's dictionary 
as a profoundly ten- 
der or passionate 
affection for a per- 
son. It says noth- 
ing about color. 

Misty 
and Bobby have 
just as much 
right to love one 
another and to be happy as 
anybody else. We are all put on this 
world to live and be happy even if 
that includes falling for someone of 
a different race. We arc all human, 
and love is a part o( our human 
nature. All the same. Misty and 
Bobby love the song, "Jungle 
Fever,"

that the HIV virus 
could be transmitted if 
both individuals have 
open sores or cuts in 
the mouth.

Is Powell the right African American to 
be President? 

tolin I'nwcll (or PtcsiiJcnt? Il 
will never happen Not because 
he's not a good man miiKl you. bui 
because we live in such a tjcisi 
society ihal would never permit an 
African American lo lead (his 
counuy- 

Thefc. It's finally been said. 
Everyone seems to be skirting 
around Ihal sentence. Leave it to 
The CommunicaUit lo talk about 
(he rea] issue 

USA Today did a poll the first 
week of October which prediclcd 
■bill Powell would win a two way 
race between President Clinton and 
himself and would seriously effect 
A three way race between Clinton. 
Sen, Bob Dole and himself. This is 
not a fair comparison. Until Powell 
throws his hat into the ring, he will 
not be ircaied the same — unscrupu- 
lously—as the other candidates. 
Until the public sees what is hiding 
in Powell's closEi, these polls arc 
not truly representative of public 
opinion. Case in point, last elec- 
tion. dissatisHcd voters were court- 
ed by sound-bite king, Ross Perot. 

Perot's fifteen minutes were 
more than enougti to burst this 
mapical bubble for many potential 



voters. Those who did vote for 
Perol were not actually attempting 
to vote Perot into office, but rather 
to send a message to traditional 
politicians 

We do agree, however, that a 
black president would improve 
race relations immensely, as well 
as put an intcicsiing spin on eco- 
nomic issues. Bui, ptrhaps Powell 
is not that person. Why not Sen 
Carol Moseley-Braun &lt;D-II1.1 or 
Rep, Kweise Mfume (l&gt;Md,). both 
of whom have made tremendous 
headway in their respective slates 
and have more government experi- 
ence than Powell, lo be president? 

One gigantic plus Powell has 
over any other African American 
who runs for president is that no 
one could say, "He will never 
become president because someone 
will shoot hun first," Powell is too 
well liked by every edinic group in 
America to be killed solely on the 
basis of his race 

He has earned a degree of 
respect from many Americans in a 
short amount of lime and po&amp;sihly 
will earn more in the future. Only 
after the grueling election inquisi- 
tion will we know for sure.

Commentarv 



Put up your dukes, Jeff Brunson, I challenge you to a debate 



by Daniel J- Wcstrick 
Columnist 

This is a response to die column 
written by Jeff Brunson, published 
by the Communicator on Oct, 12, 
titled "Soudcr's Raid on Student 
Aid: Silence = Consenl." 

In this worthless and tasteless 
editorial, he cites "The Alliance to 
Save Siudenl Aid," Sept. 1, 1995 
and Slates, '"some members of 
Congress' (never slating or provid- 
ing support that this group included 



Rep. Mark Souderl added an 
amendment thai 'would cut all fed- 
eral funds to universities that allow 
student activity fees to be used to 
fund campus-based groups involved 
in activities aimed at 'inHuencing 
public policy'" This is unptece- 
denied. Never before has a bill con- 
tained an amendment before it was 
sent through the congressional tun- 
nels. 

Like most liberals. Mr Brunson 
has jumped to conclusions! Did Mr. 
Biunson forget to state the reason 



why Souder came lo IPPA' on Oct. 
5? Maybe, Mark Souder was here 
because Oct. 5 was tlie only date he 
could spare. The 435 members of 
Congress arc busy this time of year. 
Coming on a day that class was not 
in session should not be used 
against him. 

It was a disgrace for Mr. 
Brunson and his liberal friends to 
display signs that state "Dump 
Souder." I was pleased to see the 
"thought police" take down the 
garbage that was put up by protest- 



ers who shamelessly state lalse 
things about our great fourth district 
Congressman. I support protesting, 
but not bashing. 

Members of the IPFW family. I 
will not support falsehiKids in the 
student newspaper of the school I 
am proud to attend. It would be my 
pleasure to damage the credibility 
of Mr Brunson in the form of a 
public debate, I know that he does 
not have the courage to accept diis 
challenge, but I offer it nonetheless 
fur many re;isons- 



lirst. Mr Brunson should be 
required lo reveal his sources for 
the information he prints, I say he 
makes up this hogwash. but this 
would give him a chance to prove 
thai It's not. 

The second reason is accuracy. 
A debate would give you and me 
the chance to talk Mr, Brunson 
about his views and bring out the 
truth. 

If this debate were to happen. I 
would want it lo be at least two 
hours in length. One hour to debate 



Student Oreanizations 



Gay group supports 
discarded professor 

Chancellor missing out on 
opportunity to diversify university 



To Cfioncellor Michael Wunelt: 

We are writing to inform you of 
our desire for a more diverse cam- 
pus and our support for any effort 
on the pan of your office to make 
decisions or establish policies and 
procedures that might serve to bring 
about this worthy goal. We are 
committed to the belief thai diversi- 
ty, in its many forms, is necessary 
and indeed desirable at the universi- 
ty and, of course, in the larger soci- 
ety. But. we cannot influence Ihai 
which occurs in the larger society 
as much as that which happens right 
here, right now at IPFW, It is our 
belief that more diversity among 
.Mudenis, faculty and adnutiistration 
at IPI^ could only serve to better 
our university and to enrich the 
lives of those who ate here, in 
whatever capacity. We are certain 
that you agree with us on the cor- 
rectness of this belief. 

As concenicd students, interest- 
ed in a more complete university, 
we respectfully rei|uest that you 
strongly consider the dire need for 
more diversity and the conse- 
quences of any decisions which 



would ultimately guide us in the 
opposite direction We ask thai you 
seek 10 assert your commitment 
wherever conceivable, whenever 
reasonable, and in whatever deci- 
sions feasible. We ask that you 
reconsider offering Rheba Knox a 
full-time, leaching position on this 
campus. 

We are aware of the limitations 
placed on your office by the bud- 
getary shortfall and can only specu- 
late about the degree of pressure 
under which you and your siaff 
must be operating. We view your 
task as a commendable one. deserv- 
ing of nothing less than respect and 
admiration. So, in writing this let- 
ter our purpose is not to instruct 
you on how to perform your duties; 
rather, il is to urge you to affirm 
your commitment to diversity by 
retaining in a full-time, leaching 
capacity Rheba Knox, who has so 
consisicnlly proven her abilities in 
the classroom. 

Thank you for your lime and 
consideration.

Latino Heritage important 



On Oct. 12, 1492 Columbus dis- 
covered the beautiful land of 
America. He brought many positive 
things lo the New World One of 
the most important things was the 
development of the Latino Culture. 
Latin America stretches from 
Mexico to Chile. In this enormous 
parcel of land, people can experi- 
ence different sub-cultures of the 
Latino Culture. As president of 
Hispanos Unidos. il is my duty lo 
speak about our Latino heritage, 
which is being celebrated this 
month. 

For 13 years Latinos have held 
the United Stales Hispanic 
Leadership Council, This year's 
conference, held in Chicago on Oct. 
7, highlighted the performance of 
different Latino community leaders. 
The conference offered workshops 
throughout the day to improve the 
attendant's knowledge of different 
Latino subjects. The main purpose 
of the conference was lo motivate 
and create new leaders in different 
communities all over the United 
States. 

Juan Andrade. organizer of the 
conference, impressed me and 
many others with a molivational 
speech on Saturday night. He said. 
"A fool IS the one that believes that 
English should be the official lan- 
guage of the United Stales, but a 
bigger fool is the one who believes 
that he or she can go to the next 
century just knowing English." 



I share the seniimenl of 
Andrade's strong and powerful 
statement. The world is becoming 
more competitive and die more lan- 
guages we know ihe better. 

When the dinner was over, 1 
approached Andrade and expressed 
my feeling about his speech He 
asked me how I knew about the 
conference and if my school was 
supporting our participation in ihe 
conference. I said Hispanos Unidos 
is an organization which tries every 
year lo attend Ihe conference, but 
although die university assisted in 
transportation, they did noi help 
olTsetihe expenses. 

This brings me to Ihe topic of 
school support for interest groups 
IPFW believes interest groups do 
not fairly represent the university 
However, if someone were to a.sk 
me where 1 came from. I must 
answer. "I am from IPFW." 

Many people asked me where I 
was from and thai wiis my answer. 
Even though the school considers 
me and our group unrepresenLitive 
of the university and the students. 

I would assert that any student 
who goes off the campus for an 
exU^acurritular aclivily with which 
the school has any involvement 
(whe'ther directly or indirectly) 
should be funded by the university. 
If Hispanos Unidos would have 
destroyed property at the confer- 
ence, the blame would have fallen 
on IPFW as a whole, not only

Hispanos Unidos. Indirccdy, I rep- 
resent all the students and the uni- 
versity. Not only am I upset abtiut 
the lack of funding but even more 
so by die topic of diversity or lack 
of It, 

I understand IPFW wants lo 
involve different elements of the 
community, but a speech about 
diversity is not going to solve the 
problems. One month ago, we had a 
diversity forum on campus 
Everyone mentioned how good 
diversity is. but no one gave solid 
solutions which would increase ihe 
diversity on campus. One thing I 
learned many years ago is never to 
say what I do nol intend to do. In 
other words. IPFW should not be 
preaching diversity if they will not 
promoie it. I think the diversity 
forum was held for die simple rea- 
son of being "politically correct." 

A simple way of promoting 
diversity is to support campus 
minority groups. Il is very easy to 
say somediing. but it is difficult to 
act. I would like to see the adminis- 
tration promote diversity on cam- 
pus' For example, hiring more 
Latino and African-American pro- 
fessors will ultimately serve as a 
recruiting tool to entice more 
Latino and African -American stu- 
dents. 

Andre Fux

Hispanos Unidos 



the topics and questions prepared 
by a panel, preferably members of 
the media and/or professors of 
political science. The second hour 
could be used to field questions 
from Ihe audience. 

This debate could prove Mr. 
Brunson basically has nolhing to 
say, and thai what he docs say is of 
littie truth. 

Bui since this debate probably 
will never happen, 1 can just dream 
lhai Jeff Drunson is idling! the unith. 



Letter 



Some People 
Just Don't Get If 

Dear Editor: 

After reading "Hiding 
Sexuality is a Compromise, " I was 
moved lo wriie ihis letter. My 
only response to ihis editorial is 
SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T 
GET IT, a phrase used often by 
the Communicator. In a letter to 
Ihe editor published in Oct, 12. 
1995 issue, Ms. Hatch was trying 
to get a point across The point 
was. if not stated clear enough, 
African Americans wear their 
color each and every day If I were 
to go to a different town, city or 
state. I would still be a black 
woman ■ not just a woman. Where 
if, a homosexual would go to the 
same town, city or state, ihey 
would Just be a woman or a man. 

Homosexuals choose to 
announce their sexual preferences. 
If Mr, Williams had nol written an 
editorial. I would never have 
known that he was homosexual. 
Nevertheless, in my case, I only 
need lo step into die light and peo- 
ple know that I am an African 
American. These two situations 
are nol comparable. 

I am not asking anyone to hide 
dieir feeling, desires or beliefs. I 
just wanted people to know thai 
diere is a difference between visu- 
al and non-visual differences. 

Be proud of who you arc and 
stand t^l against ignorance!

Jim Porter 


Vntfer the SUacfievs 



Here IS a 
puzzle for 
you. It is 
not all that 
lough, any 
monkey 
can figure 
It out. 

Why IS it 
that we 
have not 



wagon 
Cleveland 
Indians or 



Atlanta Braves fans hruiging around 
every comer'' Why is everyone and 
his brother nol donning a baseball 
cap embossed with that script A or 
Chief Wahoo? 

Normally, we would see a 
proverbial plethora of new and 
t:^Liii:d Indians fans spewing their 
iiLu -found knowledge concerning 
Ihe greainess of Orel Hershiescr 
and his pitching or Albert Belle's 
bat. Bandwagon Atlanta fans would 
be mouthing off aboul Greg 
Maddux and his fast ball or how 
muth Chipper Jones looks like a 
young Mickey Mantle. On the con- 
trary, there has been none of the 
collective excitement usually sur- 
roundmg a professional champi- 
onship series. So the puzzle here is 
why not? Where are all of the band- 
wagon fans.' 

A couple of possible explana- 



tions could be proposed. Maybe no 
one really gives a toyal mouse's 
denii;re about the World Series, Is 
it possible there is no interest in die 
fall classic after the debacle we 
endured last season ' Has America's 
paslimc become simply a pastime? 
Doubtful, the television ratings for 
this year's World Series have been 
higher than in recent years There 
has to be another answer. 

Mow about the fact that we all 
feel so sorry for both (earns we do 
not really care which team wins. 
After ail, the Indians have not 
played this late into the fall since 
1948 In the Braves' case, are they 
major league baseball's answer to 
the Buffalo Bills' Maybe it does 
not matter Maybe deep down 
inside we will all feel remorse for 
die loser Then again, maybe not. 

So what is the answer you ask 
Why is it Cleveland fans are nol 
climbing out of the walls and why 
aren't Braves fans lurking around 
every comer? It is because no one 
really wants to admit diey are eidicr 
a Braves or an Indians fan For fear 
of being ridiculed and harassed, 
only a few very daring souls have 
recently ventured into public wear- 
ing a Braves jersey or Indians cap. 
It is all a matter of pride and digni- 
ty- 

Sure, we are guaranteed to see a 
tidal wave of joyous Braves fans 



following Ihe uliimale demise of the 
Indians, but that will last only a 
few days. As for ihe Indians fans, 
the few, the proud will once again 
stow their favorite Chief Wahoo 
caps deep inside dieir closets and 
wail another fifty years. 

In a year that was cut short by an 
ugly strike and prolonged by mean- 
ingless wild card playoffs, it is nice 



to know that baseball really has not 
lost its place in Ihc hearts of 
Americans. True baseball fans real- 
ize this is just a fluke year and it 
really docs nol matter who wins the 
World Scries. Take it ^ you 
will, .just remember, the view from 
under the bleachers is not always a 
pretty one.
