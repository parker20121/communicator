said Keefer, 'Our main objec- 
tive Is to give the person mus- 
cle balance.' 

The massage therapists 
brought special chairs that are 
designed speciHcally for chair 
massages with them. The 
chairs were developed because 
the college wanted to expand 
massage techniques for people 
who didn't have time for a 
table massage. 'These chairs 
are very mobile and we can go 
to offices to provide this ser- 
vice. A 15-minute chair mas-

Keefer. "In these chairs, the 
weight is taken off the hips 
and distributed throughout 
the body, so there is no added 
stress to the body." 

According. to Livingston, 
some massage participants 
become so relaxed that they 
have to get out of the chair 
very slowly to allow their mus- 
cles adequate time to adjust.

Graham Richard in Walb

Tuesday, Ocl 26. 



The dis 



1 of the 



candidates was recorded by- 
NBC 33 and Comcast Cable 
Channel 56. This debate was 
open to the public. 

Both candidates walked

both see a need to inject 

diversity into the city." 

Some of the topics up for 
discussion fell under the cate- 
gories of 2l5t Century prob- 
lems, crime, neighborhoods 
and unemployment. 

Diversity in the work- 
place, downtown revltallza- 

lance service, neighborhood 
safety and youth violence 
were some of the topics that 

"it was very good and 
very fair," said citizen Gordon 
Craef of the election. 

Each candidate had 
approximately one and a halt 
to two and a half minutes to 
answer a question and iO sec- 



"It is absolutely 
essential that IPFW 
gets equity funding 
and J will be a pest to

candidate 



onds to rebut remarks made 
by the opponent. 

"1 was very Impressed with 
Linda's clear vision and how 
she spelled out all of her 
plans. Linda has a lot ol 
things that she has already 
done for the city and has 
plans for the future. 1 didn't 

thing of any real substance," 
said Amy Gibson, a Fort 
Wayne residenL 

The following question 
was asked concerning unem- 
ployment, "The unemploy- 
ment rate In Fort Wayne is 
2.9 percent and it Ls 13 to 14 
percent in the urban enter- 
prise zone, which is heavily 
populated by minorities. 
What is your plan to rejuve- 
nate this area?" 

Richard stressed the use 
of programs that have been 
successful in the past for 
other cities. The Work Force 
Development Program and a 
separate program in which 
first lime youth offenders of 
the law serve time learning 
about a career of their choice. 
Richard stressed a partner- 
ship with schools, churches 
and a collaborative effort 
with enterprises in order to 
reach out to young people so 
they can gel an education

Buskirk agreed with the 
programs but also suggested 
bringing Jobs closer to the 

transportation and providing 
childcare opportunities for 
single parents.

city currently has. 

When asked what would 
be done aboui funding prob- 
lems at IPFW, the candidates 
gave Ihe following responses, 
Buskirk-'I was one of the 
people who weni on all those 
buses back on Feb 10. It is 
absolutely essential that IPFW 



gets equity funding and I will 
be a pest to our state tcglsla- 

rcach that juncture. All these 
things we talk about such as 
work force development 
don't' mean anything If we 
don'i have a competitive uni- 
versity. This Is why Lafayette, 
Bloomlngton and Indianapolis 
are ahead of us because they 
have the university resources. 
IPFW has to be treated as one 
of the premiere universities 
instead of on the bottom of 
the state." 

Richard- I've already 
had the opportunity to do 
some of ihai work. 1 was a 
stale senator here when there 
was only one building. 1 
helped to gel Ihe merger of 
the art school and the school 
of fine arts here. 1 helped to 
get through ihe legislative 
process to gel some of the 
commitments for building. 
I'm a very strong advocate of 
this university. I'm working 
really hard in one way to get 
more funding by assisting in 
gelling land dedicated from 
the Statehouse Training 
Center that the stale controls 
on the research and develop- 
ment park. There will also be 
some research and develop- 
ment dollars from the 21st 
Century Growth Fund. 1 have 
talked to legislative delega-

higher levels of wages with 
higher technologies of jobs.

(PFU/ offers fiu shots for campus, community 



by Kalhy 
News Editor 



Flu shots will be offered on Wednesday, 



Nov. 3. frc 



10 a 



Thursday, Nov. 4, from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. in 
Room U&amp;of Walb Student Union. 

Sponsored by Purdue University Worklife 
Program, IPFW Wellness Council, IPFW Nursing 
Department and the IPFW Department of 
Athletics, Rccreailon and Intramural Sports, 
die Injecdons will be lYee for IPFW employees, 
redrces and their spouses (employees must be 
at least a .5 FTE and bring an ID card). The 
cost for students and members of the commu- 
nity will be S7.50, all of which goes lo cover 
the cost of ihe vaccine. 

IPFW chose to offer a site for flu shots 
because of a desire to help prevent illness in 
faculty members and students, "We decided to 
offer a site for flu shots to help our campus 
community lower the risk of getting sick,' said 
Judy Tillapaugh, IPFW Wellness/Fitness 
Coordinator. 

The vaccine is supplied by Parkview 
Occupational Hcalih Center and the shots will 
be given by IPFW nursing students under the 
supervision of their Instructors. 

According to Sanna Hargcs, associate pro- 
fessor In the nuning department, people who 
are pregnanl. nursing, have a cold or Infection, 
have allergies to eggs or egg products or who 
are on immunosuppressants should not 



receive a flu shot. 

"Each Hu shot contains a small amount of 
three weakened flu viruses. It Is only possible 
to include Ihree viruses in a single injection, so 
each year, medical professionals from the 
Center for Disease Control work lo determine 
which three flu viruses are the most likely lo 
cause the majority of illnesses for that particu- 
lar season," said Marges. 

According to Harges, the shots work by 
infecting the recipient with a low dose of high- 
ly weakened forms of the viruses which causes 
the person to produce antibodies againsl those 
three forms of the flu. Antibodies arc natural 
defense mechanisms that fight off future Infec- 
tions of the viruses. 

Occasionally, a person may feel tired or 
mildly ill afier receiving a llu shot. This side 
effect is merely Ihe body's response lo Ihe 
introduction of the foreign organisms and 
should pass within a few days. 

IPFW has offered Hu shots for more than 
five years. In 1997, Purdue University's 
Worklife Program started offering flu shots lo 
employees al no charge to promote wellness. 

Last year, 509 people received flu shots 
and, according to Tillapaugh, this year's 
turnout Is e.xpecied to meet or exceed thai fig- 
ure. "We encourage people to come and get 
their shots to help increase their chance of 
Slaying healthy during the flu season," said 
Tillapaugh.

IPFW's campus to shut down 
was a break in a water main 
underneath one of the three 
rivers that caused the water to

biggest problem came with 
local businesses and places like 
IPFW, where a small sourte of 
water could easily become a 
large source of annoj'ancc. 

Restaurants, which need 
water for dishes, cooking and 
for beverages, were forced to 
close for a few hours. The 
places that chose to remain 
open, such as the McDonald's 
on Coliseum and IHOP, used 
bottled water (bought by the 
gallons! and store-bought ice. 
If the crisis didn't cost the 
places in business, it cost them

The mall was similarly 
closed, as was IPFW for the r^t

Mayor Helmke late in the after-

Fort Wayne whj' they had no

However, those clt&gt;' ofn-

the situation under control 
once It was assessed and man-

responsible for keeping what 
happened at nuisance level

We also believe that 
restaurant managers, store

affected by this whole situation 
deserve some credit as well. 
Through their efforts, it was 
easy for one to forget that 
there was a boil W'aier advisory

Finally, we would like to 
thank whatever caused the

water is and how hazardous a 
threat to that can be. If not for

"This was very Informa- 
tive about what Is going on in 
Africa. 1 would like to go to 
Africa to do missionary worL 
It grieves my spirit that AIDS 
is so high In Africa,- said Clara 
Williams, an IPFWsiudenL 

AIDS Is the largest world- 
wide killer after heart disease, 
strokes and resplniiorj' Infec- 
tions. According to Rondeau, 






who hai 



worked in the Congo fot 
years, AIDS Is the leading 
cause of death In Africa. Sub- 
Sahara Africa Is where most of 
the disease Is concentrated. 
Malaria used lo be the leading 
cause or death on this conti- 
nent. As of December 1998, 
there were 33.4 million people 
Infected with AIDS globally 
and 70 percent of those pco- 



live in It 
pared to most Africans. 
African countries arc consid- 
ered to be third world coun- 
tries. According to the lecture, 
Africa has a slightly larger 
land mass than China, India, 
America, Europe and New 
Zealand combined. 

Through everyday activi- 
ties, the students of IPFW 
engage in discussions, cat din- 
ner, drive cars'and go to the 
local clinic to get a checkup 
without thinking about it 
being unusual or extraordi- 
nary. Seventy-five percent of 
Africans live in rural areas. 
Most of these areas don't have 
roads and some of the major 
nties with healthcare racilities 
can be up to 50 miles away. 
There are not as many forms 



Finally, the cultural and 
tribal belief system of Africans 
has an effect on the AIDS epi- 
demic. In Africa, said 
Rondeau, a widow Is supposed 
' ed by her hu 



govern- will catch HIV from their 
; people young relative. There are 
! created approximately 60.000 street

research. Half of Africa's pop-

a husband and wife arc not 
supposed to have sexual rela- 
tions with each other while 
the wife is with child. 
However, the couple can have 
sex with other Individuals. 
AIDS (an he passed via these 
practices. Prostitution Is 
another factor for the spread 
of AIDS. 

The African family is 
often an extended family that 

grandparents. This family 
structure is being deteriorated 
by AIDS. Most AIDS infected 
people are not axpected to live 
past 40. Children become 
orphans of parents who die of 
AIDS. Often, many children 
who have contracted the virus 
and do have an extended fam- 
abandoned by their 



s of 
age. 

Rondeau also said that 
decisions in a oibe arc made 
by a consensus, instead of a 
majority rule, as in America. 

Africa during an event. The 
rclationihips between the peo- 
ple In the event are more 
important than the task or the 
amount of time it takes to dis- 
cuss the task. For many coun- 
tries, said Rondeau, the watch 
is a status s&gt;-mbol. 

All of these factors are 
part of the reason for the 
huge AIDS epidemic in Africa. 
Until the early 90s, Africa 
denied that there ivas a prob- 
lem with AIDS. 

"I saw a lot of problems 
with the missions In Africa. 
Many of them are practically 
dying, I saw this as a special 
' Kern. 



For several years, other coun- 
tries could not use this drug 
because it was patented by the 
US. 

A traditional remedy 
made up of v'arious herbs has 
been used in Africa to raise 
the white blood cell count of 
citizens. In Nairobi, according 
to Rondeau, there is a drug 
that can be given to HIV posi- 
tive Infants to help reverse the 
process, TTiere arc AIDS infor- 
mation centers and teachers 
are being taught about AIDS 
so they can inform students. 
Safe sex and abstinence are 
being stressed in Africa, 
Rondeau said that condoms 
are not available in manj 
places. Rondeau is also unsure 
of the tribal views towards 
condoms. For these reasons, 
abstinence Is pushed more 
than safe sex.

Flood hits Kettler hours before water emergency 



by KaUiy Delagrange, 
News Editor 



At 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday. Oct, 20, 
construction on Kettler Hall inadvertent- 
ly triggered a sprinkler In a first floor 
ladies' restroom, spraying water for 
appro.\imately four minutes. Shortly after 
the sprinkler was set off, maintenance 
workers from the Physical Plant and 
other good Samaritans pitched in to help 
minimize water damage to Items in the 
affected areas. Information Technology 
Seniccs worked on removing the printer 
and three computers from the Writing 
Center, while construction 1%'orkers aided 
in stopping the water that was leaking 
through the ceiling tiles. 

Only the restroom in which the 
sprinkler was set off and the Writing 
Center were affected. According to Greg 



Justice, construction project manager, 
the contractor and crew that have been 
working on Kettler Hall repaired the 
damaged areas and assumed the cosl 

According to Carol Roberts, Writing 
Center Director, a tape recorder and 
approximately 35 books were damaged 
beyond use by the deluge of ivatcr. "It 
was really just an unfortunate accident, 
but eveo'onc helped out to rectify the 
situation and lessen the damage," said 
Roberts. Temporarily relocated in Kettler

remain open during its regular hours 
while repairs were being made. By 
Monday, the Writing Center was able to

were called and they helped pass on the

"Signs were posted throughout the build-

Fort Wayne was under a boll water

open porlal to a universe 
unfamiliar, yci fantastical- 
ly beautiful. The punch 
line is that 1 only paid a 
S1.99 for ihls piece of jazz 

John Abcrcromble Is a 
jazz guitarist from Oslo, 
Norway. The back cover of 
"Gateway," which was record- 
ed in 1975, has Abcrcrombic 
pictured with none other than 
Jack Dcjohnette and Dave 
Holland. Now you know why I 
purchased the album. 

For starters, Dejolineite 



appeared alongside the likes 
of Chick Corca, Pat Melhenj', 
Kill Frlsclt, Ella Fitzgerald and 
ilerbic Hancock, just to name 
a few. It comes as no surprise 
that "Gateway" is a world 

The opening track, "Back- 
Woods Song" starts with 
Holland laying down a bass 
groove lo deep and lyrical 
that It gives the impression 
that the listener Is in a forest 
rather than a small wooded 
area. Abcrcromble and 
Holland share much of the 
melody, but the tune clearly 
belongs to Holland, whose 
ability to keep the music 
pushing forw'ard is unparal- 



leled. Dejohnette lays down a Sea' 
solid groove pattern that 
moves around his drumiet. 
What is interesting about 
Dejohnette's style of pla&gt;-inB 
is that he is constantly mov- 
ing around the cymbals and 
drums without disturbing 
Holland's and Abercrombie's 
beautiful melodic pattern. 

The last track on ihe 
album. 'Sorcer) 1," Is where 
the trio really shines as a 
cohesive unit. Abercromble 
and Dejohnette are both 
heavily engaged in a bit of 
freeform witchcraft, while 
Holland calmly plucks away at 
his bass. The effect Is star- 
tlingly musical in all of its 
groove-y glory. 



ncredible bit a( 
sound shifting on the pan 
of Abercrombic. His sound 
is much like Bill Frisell's. 
clean with loads of reverb. 
Abercromble sounds like 
he is playing in a giant ice 
castle. This effect would be 
lost if not for Towner's 






isics 



Abercrombic has mastered his 
style of playing and his sound 
is effortless and beaudful. 

Other albums by 
Abercromble are "Timeless" 
with Dejohnette on drums, 
■Current Events" with Marc 
Johnson and Peter Ersktne, 
-Arcade,'' "Night" and a self- 
titled album featuring the 
Abercrombic Q.uar 



mbie rele 
solo album in 1977 entitled 
"Characters." This is a light 
album that features his 
extremely nimble lingers and 
the ubiquitous pitch bending 
that Is an Abercrombic trade- 
mark. Many of the songs on 
this album feature quick, 
melodic passages augmented 

"Characters" is an album that 
Is perfect for those interested 
In wonderful jazz guitar music 
that Is both melodic and tech- 
nical. It is apparent that

] trio of Adam 
lum on drums. Dan 
Hammond organ and. 

This is a wonderful 
album that veers to the left of 
contemporao' jazz trios. 

Abercromble never fails 
to amaze me with his sense of 
musicalicy, timing and free 
motion. His music soars and is 
unencumbered by the traves- 
ty of modern Jazz music. 
Abercromble has continued 



where others have left off. He 
is leading a musical culture 
into the new millennium by 
clinging to his musical roots 



Abercromble has just released 
another solo album entitled 
"Open Land," which is how I 
see Abercrombie's musical lin- 
eage-a vast open land where

'Double Jeopardy' and 'Drive Me Crazy' don't live up to hype 



by Nancy Simmonds, 
SlaH Wnter 






. Parol 



It may be fall, 
over at the bo\ office. You can still see 
two summer-style flicks that are full of 
fluff and fun. 

"Double Jeopardy" had a terrific 
trailer and was long anticipated by 
movie crowds. This may e^plain its 
high gross the first week of release- 
Ashley Judd portrays Libby 
Parsons, a woman who is accused and 
found guilty of the murder of her hus- 
band, iviiile In prison, she finds infor- 



Travis Ij^hman, played by Tommy Lee 
Jones, is hot on her heels. 

There are no surprises here. You 
have seen Jones in this role before and 
the only new aspect of Jones' perfor- 
mance is his awful haircut. 

Judd. however, did a Tine )Db w'att 
her performance, considering the 
scarcity of the script. There was no 
defense at her murder trial and her 
six-year prison sentence flashed by in 
two screen minutes. You sec all of it in 
the trailer.

my mistake. If you cxpec 
average movie, "Double Jeopardy" 
won't be all that bad, at lea^t until the 
ending which was grade B, at best. 
There it lost any credibllltj' it may 
have contained. It was fluff and it was 
fun, but I'd rate it only fair. 

"Drive Me Crazy" also had a good 
trailer and I had high hopes for this

and attend the big dance lo make their 
farmer loves jealous. 

You have probably seen this 
movie before In one form or another. 
What makes this one different Is good 
character development. The characters 
actually seem as if ihey could be real 
(albeit old) high school students. The 
plot is character-driven and, although 
you know where It is going, there are 
enough twists to make the (ourney 
interesting. 

All of this happens, in spite of the 
director. It seems that when John 
Schultz gets hold of things, there are 
dead spaces, plot jumps or schmaltz. 1 
wish he could have let loose as f)aniel 
Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez did in 
-The Blair Witch Project." I wonder 
what would have happened with such 
rich characters and bright actors) No 
such luck for us, though. "Drive Me 
Crazy" stays within the bounds of the 
typical high school prom storj', expect- 
ed ending and all. It's Huff, but Ifi

Soccer team reaches milestone; 
Dons aim for NCAA tourney spot 



by Biian Miller. 
Sports Editor 



Terry Stefanklewicz has 
achiei'cd many goals in his 17 
years as head coach of men's 
soccer in addition to earning 
his tenure at IPnv . 

However, he has not had 
the satisfaction of being the 



eing 



•anket 



twelfth In the nation. On Oct 
23, Coach Stefanklewicz 
received the great honor of 
reaching both of those mile- 
stones with his team poised to 
win the Great Lake Valley 
Conference Championship as 
well. 

With a win against 
Southern Indiana, the Dons 
will host the tourney and will 
have the opporiunitj' to earn 
a spot In the NCAA Division II 
soccer tournament. 

Although it has been a 
combination of the highl}- 
publlcized offensive attacks of 
Ian Luya and Matt Hein that 
has given the Dons much of 
their success this year, the 
defense has contributed to 



the te 



well. 



Coaltender Jeff Richey 
ind defenders Brian Knitter 
ind Dave Smith have posted 
11 shut-outs and the defense 
ias permitted only eight goals
