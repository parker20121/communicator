Campus Ministry offers support for students 



by MishannaWood, 
News Editor 



Students who wish lo get closer 
to God, enrich their spiritual life or 
make new friends should look into 
Campus Ministry. 

This ministry has existed for 25 
years. 

The ministry motto is 
"Becoming real with God, ourselves, 
and others." 

Campus ministry is not an orga- 
nization for any specific religion or 
school. 

This Is simply a Christian min- 
istry. The campus minister, Ben 
Gates, Is also a minister at the 



Indiana Institute of Technology. 

"Everyone is welcome to come 
to meetings. We don't meet on cam- 
pus because there are students from 
four or five other schools who 
attend. There are not enough stu- 
dents to have separate groups on 
each campus," Gates said. 

Every Monday there is a Bible 
study from noon to 1 p.m. in Walb 
112 and every Sunday evening meet- 
ings are held from 7 to 8:30 at St. 
Joseph United Methodist Church, 
6004 Reed Road. 

A religious forum, held in Walb 
224 on the third Thursday of every 
month is also available. 

"They are a real friendly group. 
They have a habit of going out to eat 
after meetings," Gates said. 



The students are the ones who 
plan and choose when, what, where 
and whom they will volunteer to 
help. They plan from month to 
month. 

A major service that is planned 
for this semester is a trip to Arizona. 

During the week of spring 
break, students will be making 
repairs on homes and a school on an 
Apache Indian reservation. 

They also partake in local ser- 
vices. 

The ministry may be giving 
assistance to Love Church, a church 
for the homeless. 

During diversity week the group 
gathers a panel of representatives 
from different religions together to 
discuss racial issues. 



While helping others, seeing 
new places and studying the Bible, 
students have the chance to make 
many friends. 

"They become part of a caring 
group of people when relationships 
are at a premium with people com- 
ing and going. This is a place to 
explore spiritual questions and 
potential. If you're mad at God, this 
is a place to feel safe and come to 
terms spiritually," Gates said. 

According to Gates, many stu- 
dents make courageous life deci- 
sions. 

After studying the Bible and 
interpreting and understanding it on 
their own terms, some students have 
made life-changing decisions and 
have felt at peace with themselves. 



Gates' Ph.D. in history Is an 
asset that makes it easier to under- 
stand and help the variety of reli- 
gious backgrounds of the students. 

Gates also has "spiritual-cyber 
vitamins" available to anyone. 

These "vitamins" are weekly 
spiritual thoughts sent out to the 
students, faculty and staff. 

If you would like one e-mail 
Gates at gatesb&lt;a&gt;ipfw.edu. 

If you would like to learn more 
about Campus Ministry, stop in at 
the third floor of Helmke Library or 
call 461-6992. 

Campus Ministry also works 
closely with the Newman and 
lntervarsity group on campus, also 
located on the top floor of the 
Helmke Library. 



Research symposium 
calls for submissions 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
Chief Reporter 

Students will be given 
the opportunity to present 
undergraduate research or 
performances at IPFW on 
April 23 at the 
Undergraduate Research 
and Creative Endeavor 
Symposium. 

The event is designed 
to promote undergraduate 
research through the guid- 
ance of faculty members. 

"We think that under- 
graduates should partici- 
pate in research and cre- 
ative activity because it 
individualizes their acade- 
mic experience," said David 
McCants, associate vice 
chancellor for Academic 
Affairs. 

Last year, the first sym- 
posium was held at IPFW. It 
is now scheduled to contin- 
ue as an annual event. 

"We rely heavily upon 
faculty suggesting to stu- 
dents that they do this," 
said McCants. 

Students who chose to 
participate may or may not 
chose to present research 
previously developed in 
class. 

"We are hearing some 
highly sophisticated work, 



but that is just proof that 
IPFW has a significant num- 
ber of creative students," 
said McCants. 

Students who are inter- 
ested should contact the 
Office of Academic Affairs 
because there is a March 25 
deadline for turning in the 
abstract and the intent 
form. 

"It is not too late to 
show interest for this year's 
symposium," said McCants. 
"And it's definitely not too 
early to express interest for 
next year's." 

Presentations may use 
posters or other visuals and 
performing/visual arts pre- 
sentations ma &gt;■ involve 
music, dance, theater, fine 
and applied arts, video or 
writing. 

All presentations 
should last around 12 min- 
utes with a few additional 
minutes for questions from 
those present. 

The symposium will 
take place in Walb Union 
on Friday, April 23, in four 
different rooms throughout 
the day. 

For more information, 
contact the Office of 
Academic Affairs at 481- 
6805.

Survey: Students happy with services at IPFW 



IPFW students are 
pleased with the services 
they're getting at IPFW. 

In the recent Student 
Satisfaction Inventory, devel- 
oped by UDSA Group, Noel- 
Levitz, Inc., students gave 
feedback on more than 100 
items to provide 12 composite 
scales. 

The areas include: 
responsiveness to diverse 
populations, safety and secu- 
rity, service and excellence, 
student centeredness, campus 
climate, campus life, campus 
support services, concern for 
the individual, and the effec- 
tiveness of instruction, 



recruitment and financial aid, 
registration and academic 
advising. 

Students rate each item 
in the inventory by the 
importance of the specific 
expectation as well as their 
satisfaction with how well that 
expectation is being met. 

IPFW student responses 
are compared with national 
group norms from other four- 
year institutions. 

In 1998, the comparison 
showed that IPFW students 
were more satisfied than 
those at other Tour-year pub- 
lic institutions in 11 of the 12 
survey areas and were equally 



satisfied in the twelfth area, 
academic advising. 

This same survey in 1994 
showed that students were 
more satisfied than the 
national group in only one 
area, safety and security. 

The performance gap 
(the importance rating minus 
the satisfaction rating) in 
1998 improved in all 12 
areas, with the greatest 
increases in the areas of 
recruitment and financial aid, 
instructional effectiveness and 
campus support services. 

According to the 1998 
and 1994 data, the five areas 
of most importance to IPFW 



students remained 
unchanged. 

They were, in rank order, 
safety and security, academic 
advising, instructional effec- 
tiveness, registration effec- 
tiveness and campus services. 

Students completing the 
1998 inventory stated they 
have high satisfaction with 
their IPFW experiences, 
believe IPFW meets their col- 
lege experience expectations, 
and say they would enroll at 
IPFW again. 

From 1994 to 1998, the 
top four factors which influ- 
ence a student's decision to 
enroll at IPFW remained 



unchanged. 

These four factors (in 
order of importance) are cost, 
academic reputation, financial 
aid and location. 

"It is very gratifying to 
have the students acknowl- 
edge the considerable efforts 
of faculty and staff who have 
worked hard on a variety of 
initiatives to improve the edu- 
cational experience for stu- 
dents at IPFW," said Frank 
Borelli, vice chancellor for 
student affairs.

Race is only one type of 
human trait that makes peo- 
ple diverse from each other. 
During the PBS teleconfer- 
ence, "Racial Legacies and 
Learning," held last 

Wednesday in the 

Engineering and Technology 
Building, Rm. 146, the topic 
of racial diversity on college 
campuses and in the work 
environment was discussed. 

The panelists were as fol- 
lows: Mildred Garcia, an asso- 
ciate vice provost for academ- 
ic affairs at Arizona State 
University and the editor of 
"Affirmative Action's 

Testament of Hope: Strategies 
for a New Era in Higher 
Education"; Rachelle Hood- 
Phillips, the chief diversity 
officer for Avantica 
Restaurant Group who helped 
make major transformations 
in Denny's Inc.; Carol Gear 
Scheinder, president of the 
AAC&amp;U, Association of 
American Colleges and 
Universities, and creator the 
Racial Legacies and Learning 
Initiative and Wayne 
Winborne, the director of pro- 
gram and policy research for 
the National Conference for 
Community and Justice. 

For two hours, these four 
panelists shared their views 
and experiences on the diver- 
sity concept. 

The first question asked 
was, "Why is it so difficult to 
speak about race?" 

"People are afraid to 
make mistakes," said Garcia. 

"First of all, the experi- 
ence of slavery was a legal- 
ized discrimination and there 
were different forms of ideals. 
There is a stark contrast that 
some people have not had the 
opportunity to explore. 
Secondly, this is internally 
linked to personal issues: 
'Where should I move?' "What 
school should I go to?* and 
'How well does this impact 
me?'" Winborne answered. 

The panelists all agreed 
that everyone has a different 
history and we all need a 
chance to go back. The 
process is just as important as 
the outcome. 

People need to work 
together and talk with each 
other.

TOPIC: 

Being Superficial 



WHAT WE THINK: 

There is more to life 
than being attractive! 



Pretty, defined in the new 
edition of the Merriam 
Webster Dictionary, is as fol- 
lows: "Pleasing by delicacy or 
_race, having conventionally 
accepted elements of beauty." 

"Handsome — sizable, 
ample, generous, liberal, 
pleasing and usually impres- 
sive in appearance." 

"Superficial—of or relat- 
ing to the surface or appear- 
ance only, not thorough: 
shallow." 

The question is, does 
being pretty or handsome 
really matter. Do these quali- 
ties get you anywhere in life? 

Sure, they do. These are 
key traits' for television per- 
formances and modeling 
careers. One may be the cen- 
ter of talk at a party. It can 
get you a date over someone 
else. All of this is true, for 
awhile. 

In the introductory of 
communication class it is 
taught that appearance is the 
first aspect people judge each 



other by. Within a few sec- 
onds a person can be dis- 
missed based on appearance. 

Anyone can see that 
Americans value appearance 
greatly. Magazines, television 
shows relate attractiveness to 
being "popular and happy." 
Vogue, Glamour, GQ., just 
read the covers. 

Other than in the media, 
items of vanity can be found 
throughout your day. Can 
you recollect the conversa- 
tion you had last time it was 
"ladies" or "guys" night out? 
Look at all the mirrors in 
most public bathrooms. There 
are always people combing 
their hair or putting on an 
extra dab of make-up. 

Take a look at the variety 
of products available to us, 
hair straightener, hair curler, 
hair color, Rogaine, foot 
files, nail files, pedicures, 
manicures, mascara for extra- 
long lashes, colognes and per- 
fumes and facial masks, to 
mention only a few items. 

We can't forget about all 
the cosmetic surgery the 
famous have had. Michael 
Jackson's nose jobs and Dolly 
Parton's silicone chest are the 
first to come to mind. 

Zillions of diets and fit- 
ness clubs are out there wait- 
ing for us as well. 

Some of this hype may be 
for a personal reason, such as 
an updated look or health. 
This is understood. Many 



people seem to go overboard. 

Are we so superficial that 
we NEED all these things to 
be accepted by others. Are we 
that insecure? From all of the 
details mentioned above the 
answer seems to be yes. 

All of us who are secure 
about ourselves know that 
answer is wrong. 

Being "pretty" has its 
advantages, but physical 
attractiveness alone will not 
take you to the parts of life 
that really count for some- 
thing. 

The television stars 
should be happy right? 
Millions of dollars, a huge 
home, great career, travels 
about the world. No. Many 
stars have had drug problems 
(Kurt Cobain), divorces 
{Bruce Willis and Demi 
Moore), gambling problems 
(M.C. Hammer) and being 
stalked (Brad Pitt). Sounds 
like the life, huh. 

Looks alone will not make 
you happy, rich, funny, car- 
ing, intelligent or fall in love. 

You will not win the race 
get the job or build the house 
with solely your outside 
appearance. All of these 
assets come from using your 
mind and hard work. 

We want all of you to 
remember that looks decline 
with age and in the history 
books people are not remem- 
bered for their looks but for 
their accomplishments.

A" Parking 



Dear editor, 

I'm writing concerning the arti- 
cle "Campus parking: What's the 
low down?" 

It said "A" parking is for facul- 
ty and staff and they pay S42 for a 
partial semester or S84 for a full 
year of class. 

A full-lime student, like myself, 
taking 18 full credit hours is pay- 
ing S42.30 ( S2.35 a credit hour) 
for a partial semester for "B" park- 
ing. 

Why should I have to pay 30 
cents more for "B" parking than a 
faculty or staff member would pay 



for "A" parking. 

IPFW used to make students 
pay a set amount for parking, but 
they changed that because it was 
said that a student taking 3 credit 
hours should not have to pay the 
same amount as a student taking 
18 credit hours. 

I agree with this, but a person 
taking 18 credit hours should not 
have to pay more for a "B" parking 
spot than for an "A" parking spot. 

I see three solutions to this prob- 
lem. Either: 

1. I should be able to park in an 
"A" spot. I am paying more than 



what an "A" spot costs anyways. 

2. IPFW should raise the price of 
"A" parking. Of course this 
wouldn't work very well because 
faculty and staff do not have to 
buy an "A" permit. They can park 
in the "B" parking for free. 

3. Keep the price of "B" parking at 
S2.35 a credit hour, but limit how- 
much a student has to pay. For 
example, no more than S25 per 
partial semester.

From the mind of a madman 



I'm the type of person who 
feels it is unnecessary to experi- 
ment with mind altering sub- 
stances. I have just come to the con- 
clusion that my mind and body are 
jumbled up enough as they are 
without adding anything to the con- 
fusion of everyday life. 

This week things got seriously 
out of whack for me. No, I didn t 
decide to trip acid, experiment with 
cocaine, take shrooms, or smoke 
any assortment of things, I had to 
have my wisdom teeth extracted. 
This required several different 
methods of altering my conscience. 

First off, I fasted for about 18 
hours before the operation was to 
take place. This left my stomach 
very uneasy. I stayed up late the 
night before and had been exhaust- 
ed due to some heavy exercise that 
day. 

I woke up early the day of the 
operation and was half awake the 
whole way to the operation chair. 

They sat me down in the chair, 
hooked up some heart monitors, 
and put a rubbery oxygen mask 
over my nose. 

This was also the first time that 
I have ever had an intravenous 
injection of any sort. 1 have to 
admit that I was a little nervous, 
due to the fact that like many peo- 
ple 1 am not to thrilled about 
needles. 



The nurse came into the room, 
and started to talk about my med- 
ical history- She then strapped a 
tourniquet around my bicep and 
told me that it was only going to 
hurt for a minute. She was right. It 
only hurt for a minute, then things 
started to move around the room. 
She asked if 1 was starting to feel 
the medication, and I responded 
that I hoped so. 

My chest and eyes began to get 
heavy and it felt as though some 
heavy blanket was being thrown 
over me. Before I knew it I was 
asleep. 

The next thing that I remember 
was floating down a hallway into a 
small, confined room where, a nurse 
took some bloody gauze out of my 
mouth and put some clean gauze in 
my mouth. They told me to lay 
down on a bed, but I insisted on sit- 
ting up. 

I ended up lying down some- 
how and then sitting back up. The 
doctor came by and told me that it 
was OK for me to go home. Once 
again, 1 kind of floated to my par- 
ent's van. 

I'm not sure how it happened, 
but I don't remember leaving the 
van or going in my parent's house. I 
woke up about three hours later 
lying on a couch with a dizzy 
feeling. 

I took a white pill, and lay back 



elly P. Bergman, 
Managing Editor ) 



down for a couple of hours, lazily 
looking at the images passing by on 
the television screen. I don't 
remember any of the programs that 
were on as I usually do. 

Slowly, this week 1 have been 
coming out of this zombie-like 
trance. 1 have had many problems 
with motor skills, especially trying 
to type up columns and papers for 
classes, rve misspelled probably 
half of the words that I have 
attempted to type. 

A lot of tne time this week, it 
feels as if the medicine has been 
making me lightheaded, and I've 
spent a lot of time trying to figure 
out what I was just doing. I have 
really been feeling quite senile and 
feel quite sorry for the elderly that 
have ben coping with these same 
symptoms. 

1 haven't been able to maintain 
my sense of normal abnormality. 
This whole week has pretty much 
been in a blur mixecl with much 
pain in my maxillofacial area. 

I don t understand how people 
can go through this on a constant 
or regular basis. I can see how it 
kind of frees up some stress, but to 
be this out of control is something 
that I just couldn't go through too 
often. I just hope that when it 
comes time for all of you to go 
through this that it goes well.

What's Weak this Week 



by Dennis Donahue, 
Columnist 



"Let me take this oppor- 
tunity lo give a shout out to 
all the fly-girls and homeboys 
who hang at this phal institu- 
tion. Welcome back my broth- 
ers and sisters. I'm just chillin' 
in this Journalistic house with 
my posse, know what I'm 
sayin'? Like, just messin' 
'round , having a blunt and 
some cold forties. I mean, it's 
all about respect, ya' know 
what I'm sayin'? Hell yeah 
boy, gotta go write my col- 
umn, aight." 

1 have know idea what I 
Just said, I got most of It lis- 
tening to preppy white kids 
with baggy jeans and bad 
haircuts out at Glenbrook, 

I almost shot Pepsi out of 
my nose from laughing so 
hard, overhearing the white 
youth of America out at the 
mall. I don't know what to call 
these kids. 

In California, white kids 
who try and speak and act 
"urban" get the crap beat out 
of them. The "brothers" 
(African-Americans) get sort 
of insulted when they see rich 
white kids who live at home, 
speaking the language of slang 
and "street-talk" that the 
black community has created. 
I would be too. 

It almost seems like a 
form of flattery, but in my 
opinion, it is trying to be 
something that you could 
never be, black. 

First of all, I hope that 
using "black" is okay. I don't 
mind being called "white" and 
besides, it takes too long to 
Ope out "African-American" 
or "Caucasian." 

If any of you feel like I've 
^eglected your heritage, I 
apologize. I don't expect to be 
{called "Irish-American" all Oft 
the time so maybe I have a 
problem with labels, and this 
is a problem for some people. 
I guess I'd prefer "American," 
or Just "dude." 

Secondly, I'm not speak- 
ing about ALL blacks or ALL 
whites. Obviously, not every- 
one feels or acts the same way. 
Generalizing like I am going to 
do isn't very responsible as a 
journalist. But I have never 
admitted being one (a journal- 
ist) either! 

Just bear with me and try 
to understand that this is just 
one guy's opinion. If you have 
something you want to say, 
contact the paper. I also 
answer my e-mail, most of the 
time. 

I realize that the world we 
live in is a difficult one. I 



understand that in order to fit 
in, you have to be false, and 
insecure. You have to do 
things that you normally 
wouldn't do. 

I also realize that your 
generation (people born after 
1975) is finding it hard to 
maintain an identity. But to 
borrow a culture doesn't make 
any sense, unless you are 
helping that culture. 

Not ever having experi- 
enced what blacks go through 
on a daily basis, I feel trying 
to emulate the language and 
personality that some blacks 
exhibit is just weak. Just my 
opinion of course, and I 
have a feeling that a lot of 
you agree. 

On Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr's birthday (which 
by the way was on January 
15), I noticed that a lot of 
older white people did in 
fact celebrate this great 
day in some of our local 
churches. 

Although considered a 
'black man's' holiday by 
some, Dr. King stood for so 
much more. He stood for 
equality of ALL people. 

Where were all of the 
white kids though? Come 
on, you seem to act like 
you are "down" with the 
race. 

Where were you on 
MLK's holiday? I didn't see 
you at any of the celebra- 
tions I attended. Proving 
again that it is just an act. 

I'm sure a lot of white 
kids who act black, don't 
act this way in front of 
their parents. 

They probably think 
that this makes them 
"cool." 
■ ' Speaking 'Of cool, I feel 
that blacks are cooler than 
whites. I also think women 
are smarter than men are 
but that is another column 
for another time. White 
people are too uptight, and 
too hypocritical. 

White people act so 
forgiving, yet whisper 
about blacks moving into 
their neighborhoods and 
attending their schools. 

White people seem to 
have that "we were here 
first" mentality. White peo- 
ple get angry when blacks 
want equal respect. 

"Hey, I didn't bring 
you over and make you a 
slave, get over it and get 
on with your lives," a lot of 
whites say. Blacks just 
want what Dr. King wanted: 



equal treatment. 

So go ahead and buy 
all of the gear, the pagers, 
the music, the clothes and 
see how long your little 
phase lasts.' 

Try real hard to look 
and act "street." But 
remember, until you 
decide on a personality for 
your adult life, think about 
where you come from. 

Think about what 
black people have gone 
through. Take a deep 
breath, look in the mirror 
and tell yourself that you 
are white guy trying to live 
in a black man's world. 

Realize that you 
wouldn't last an hour in 
Gary or Crenshaw. Realize 
also that you wouldn't last 
in a job interview. 

I'm not saying that 
Ebonics or slang or whatev- 
er you want to call it 
makes you sound stupid. 

But it is a language 
that was created on the 
streets, the hard streets. 
Streets where speaking a 
language was a way to sur- 
vive, not be "hip." 

1 would like to take 
this opportunity to wel- 
come back all of the stu- 
dents who are returning 
and all of the transfer stu- 
dents who will be here on 
campus this semester. IPFW 
is a great school and I'm 
glad I'll be able to call 
myself an alumnus soon. 

Use the resources that 
are provided and become 
involved in the university. 

Root for our athletic 
programs, support our stu- 
dent government, and 
learn to parka long way 
from campus! 

Good lutk this semes- 
ter, have fun, be good, and 
have a great weekend.

Diversity, continued from Page 1 



"We have so much infor- 
mation about one another 
that's wrong," Winborne said. 

Winborne's comment is 
one reason why diversity on a 
campus is important. 

In order to work and live 
together, it is important to 
drop false pretenses. 

A college campus is a 
great place to prepare stu- 
dents for the future. 

"We have to seek 
diversity, recognize the value 
and want it," Ann Fraze, asso- 
ciate faculty of sociology and 
education, said. 

"I think diversity here is 
good. I wish you could see 
more of it in grade school 
and middle school. Kids get 
into high school not prepared 



for it. They teach it but they 
don't practice it." Dawn 
Luebke, a junior majoring in 
elementary education, said. 

"Diversity is very impor- 
tant, to not only student life, 
but understanding and get- 
ting along with other cultures 
as we enter the real world," 
Joe Schroeder, IPSGA presi- 
dent, said. 

"I think it's fine here. I've 
met a lot of people in class- 
rooms and we've studied 
together and hung out 
together. There is not a lot of 
racial bias," Shannon 
Heitkamp, a senior majoring 
in accounting, said. 

"1 was at 1U Bloomington 
and saw a lot more diversity 
there. 1 don't see a lot of it 



walking down the hallway or 
in classes. There is more 
diversity among the profes- 
sors than the students," Roz 
Chamberlin, a freshman 
majoring in Spanish, said. 

According to AAC&amp;U's 
Diversity Digest, many col- 
leges require students to take 
culture courses. 

On this campus one can 
join many of the student 
organizations on campus to 
meet others. 

Multicultural services 
offers more detailed informa- 
tion on their website on 
IPFW's homepage. 

Diversity week is March 
20 through March 28.

Sororities offer benefits beyond friendship 



by Mishanna Wood, 
News Editor 

Sororities— a group of 
gals that hang out and have a 
good time. Well, that's some- 
what right. 

There are two sororities 
on campus: Pi Beta Phi and 
Delta Gamma. 

These sororities are 
Panhellcnic, meaning both 
require the presence of anoth- 
er sorority. 

They cannot exist by 
themselves. 

"Half the campus has 
misconceptions and half the 
campus doesn't even know we 
exist," Jessica Umber, rush 
chair of Pi Beta Phi, said. 

Pi Pheta Phi was estab- 
lished as the first fraternity 
for women on April 28, 1867. 
This their 25th year at IPFW. 

Sororities look for women 
who are goal-oriented, want to 
achieve high academics and 
enjoy having fun. 

"We are very diverse. 
Women can take that into 
their professional life and 
that's what we're about. Our 
organization is what our 
members bring to it," Umber 
said. 

Pi Beta Phi has study 



tables and support groups. 

The academic require- 
ment to be in this sorority is a 
2.0 GPA. 

Pi Beta Phi members 
whose grades are below the 
standard study with a proctor 
for several hours per week. 

-This is good for fresh- 
men. There are awards for 
those with good grades. It's 
like an extra pat on the back 
to make you do more," Umber 
said. 

Sororities have different 
philanthropies, or organiza- 
tions to whom they donate 
money. 

According to Umber, her 
sorority assists the program 
"Unk-to-Literacy." 

Pi Beta Phi plans to 
donate to other organizations 
as well throughout the 
semester. 

The Delta Gammas 
choose their members on a 
five points of the star system: 
scholarship, character, activi- 
ties and honors, interest and 
personal development, said 
Charlene Reitch, Delta Gamma 
member. 

" 'Do Good," is our 
motto. Do well in school, 
work, relationships and influ- 
ence," Reitch said. "This is 
lifelong friendship and an 



opportunity for advancement, 
organization and leadership 
skills." 

The academic require- 
ment for this sorority is 2.5 
on a college level and 7.5 for 
someone right out of high 
school. 

Delta Gamma was created 
in 1873 and has been at IPFW 
for 25 years. 

Delta Gamma's main phil- 
anthropy is toward the blind, 
On February i9, they will be 
working at an ice cream din- 
ner for the Fort Wayne League 
of the Blind Service. 

As a sorority member one 
has potential friends all over 
the nation. 

There are even chapters 
in different countries. 

A woman can transfer 
from one chapter to the next 
with no difficulties. 

With the many benefits 
available to sorority members, 
how can students join one of 
the IPFW chapters? 

The answer is rush. 

There are formal and 
informal rushes. 

Fall is when formal rush- 
es are conducted. 

Formal rushes require 
inductees to attend parties 
where they can meet both 
sororities. 



An informal rush is when 
an inductee is looking into 
one sorority. 

In both rushes an 
inductee has to be voted on 
and go through plcdgeship or 
learning about the specific 
sorority. 

Both rushes are over, but 
anyone can try to join 
throughout the year. 

"The main differences 
sororities have are rules and 
philanthropies. The two don't 
interact much," Umber said. 

There are also two frater- 
nities on campus for the guys 
out there, Sigma Phi Epislon 
and Phi Kappa Theta. 

These organizations rush 
all year round as well. 

Anyone interested can 
contact a sorority or fraterni- 
ty in Walb 210. 

At 3 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 
7, in the Walb Union cafeteria 
a Panhellenic meeting will be 
held for all the lady Greeks to 
come together to promote 
cohesiveness among the sys- 
tems, Umber said. 



Faculty Spotlight 



Sam Thorn, history scholar 



by Adam Taylor, 
-Features Edilor 



As many students taking 
night classes know, most of 
their teachers are only part- 
time instructors, priming their 
schedules to allow them to 
teach at IPFW during the 
evening. 

One such teacher can be 
found in the history depart- 
ment in the person of Sam 
Thorn. _ 

Sam .Thorn has led a very 
intriguing life. 




Photo by Tony Sanson, Pholo Editor] « full-b 



He was a 3rd Class Petty 
Officer in the Navy from 
1966-1972, stationed in 
Eritrea (formerly Ethiopia) in 
Western Africa and all over 
the Mediterranean. 

After having seen some of 
the greatest cities in Europe, 
he returned home to Fort 
Wayne to go to school on the 
G. I. Bill, working summers at 
Dana. 

Thorn attended college at 

IPFW. graduating in 1976 with 

a B.A. in history and in 1981 

with an M.S. in education." " 

In 1978, he began teach- 

ing 8th grade U.S. 

history at 

Huntertown Middle 
School, retaining that 
position in 1987 
when Huntertown 
formed with Perry 
Hill Middle School to 
form Carroll Middle 
School. 

He currently 
still teaches U.S. his- 
tory at Carroll on top 
of teaching H106 at 
IPFW, a position he 
has had since the 
spring semester of 
1996. 

On top of his 
career in education, 
Thorn also has 17 
yean worth of coach- 
ing high school foot- 
ball at Carroll High 
School; a position he 
left prior to starting 
at IPFW. 

Teaching part- 
time at IPFW as well 
at Carroll 



involved in keeping two dif- 
ferent types of groups inter- 
ested in history. 

"1 love it," he said. "I real- 
ly, really enjoy it." 

His interest in history 
dates back to his being an 8th 
grade student himself. 

He says he had a teacher 
in the 6 th grade that showed 
him what history really was 
by making the subject come to 
life. 



alization, he 
more fun to 
d much more 



Sam Thorn is one of the many who bring 
history to life at IPFW. 



Middle School appar- 
ently doesn't bother 
Thorn at all, despite 
the amount of work 



This vi 
said, made 
learn- about 
faetinaiing. 

His early interest in histo- 
ry would eventual!)' lead to 
his studying history during 
high school and declaring 
himself a history major in col- 
lege, subsequently leading to 
his degree. 

Although his formal edu- 
cation is over and the student 
has become the teacher, he 
feels it his responsibility as a 
teacher to continue learning 
his subject even though the 
days of sitting in a stiff desk 
and listening to his teachers 
lecture are far behind him.. 

He is a member of the 
Sons of Union Veterans, a 
genealogical organization 
whose purpose it is to pre- 
serve the memories of their 
Civil War ancestors, and he is 
an avid reader of historically- 
related books. 

"It's always been a belief 
of mine," Thorn says, "if 
you're teaching something, 
you've got to know the sub- 
ject. That's why I never bother 
with what the best-sellers are 
when I go to pick up a book. 
I'm only interested in reading 
history books, and that's how 
it should be, being a history 



teacher. You can never learn 
too much." 

Thorn's favorite area of 
interest is also the subject of a 
paper he recently had pub- 
lished—westward expansion 
with an emphasis on the 
Mexican War. 

The focus of his paper 
was placed upon prominent 
Civil War generals that 
received most of their experi- 
ence during the Mexican War. 

Many generals from both 
sides of the Civil War were 
involved in the Mexican War 
on the same side, he 1 said, and 
it was rare to hear of a Civil 
War general towards the 
beginning of the war that 
wasn't in Mexico with Zachary 
Taylor. 

"1 don't know why, but 
that's always fascinated me," 
he said. 

Thorn's goal, as far as his 
teaching career is concerned, 
has been reached, he says. 

He enjoys teaching the 
kids at Carroll during the day 
and coming out to IPFW to 
teach with a little more depth. 

His long-term goals are 
sketchy, he says, but would 
probably involve retiring to 
his cottage at Lake 
Tippecanoe. 

He also sees himself 
maybe teaching a class or two 
after retirement to keep him 
involved in history as well as 
society. 

As far as his daily goals 
go, Thorn is pretty down-to- 
earth. 

However, he does have 
one goal that he tries to reach 
on a day-to-day basis: "Be a 
better teacher tomorrow than 
I am today."

Theatre department presents modern approach 
to Shakespeare's Hs You Like It' 



by Adam Taylor, 
Fealures Editor 



Film productions like Baz Luhrman's 
"Romeo and Juliet" (1996) and the recently 
released "Shakespeare in Love" by director 
John Madden have helped popularize 
Shakespeare, particularly among younger 




Pholo by James Whitcraft, Learning Resource Center 

"As You Like 



Susan Robinson's latest production of 
It" gives. theplay a new; different look. 



moviegoers. 

Their popularity, arguably, stems from the 
marriage of traditional Shakespeare with con- 
temporary elements. 

Susan A. Robinson, director of IPFW's 
upcoming production of "As You Like It," also 
has in mind this marrying of contemporary 
elements with traditional themes. 

According to Robinson, the production 
adheres closely to 
Shakespeare's original lan- 
guage and text while utilizing 
an eclectic combination of 
costumes, music, and dance. 

Wrestling and singing 
also find their way into the 
production, as do cross-dress- 
ing and androgyny (themes 
explored through many of 
Shakespeare's works). 

The production also 
incorporates a wide range of 
musical styles including 
hymns, waltzes, and tangos- 
all original compositions by 
IPFW student John C. Hermes, 
who also serves as the play's 
music director. 

"As You Like It" is one 
of Shakespeare's greatest 
comedies, full of plot twists, 
masquerades, and explo- 
rations of carnal and uncon- 
ditional forms of love — a pro- 
duction that will appeal to all. 
It will be performed 
Feb. 12, 13, 19 and 20 at 8 
p.m. High school matinees 
will take place Feb. 17 and 18 
at 10:30 a.m. 

All performances are in 
Williams Theatre. 

Tickets are S10 for 
adults. S8 for senior citizens, 
$5 for IPFW students, $9 for 
IPFW faculty and staff and S7 
for other students. 

Tickets for the high 
school matinees are $4 and 
will be available to the gener- 
al public one hour before the 
beginning of the play, if seats 
are still available. 

The Williams Theatre 
box office will be open week- 
days starting tomon-ow from 
1:30 to 5:30 p.m., as well as 
one hour before curtain. 

To purchase tickets, call 
the William^ Theatre box 
office number at 481-6555.

Man with the Mike 



Proud to be a Mastodon 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 



Just as Purdue football's Drew 
Brees made a masterful comeback 
against Kansas State in the Alamo 
Bowl, Soto orchestrated one of the 
greatest comebacks in NCAA vol- 
leyball. 
PERIOD. 

The dying crowd was brought 
back to life as Soto brought the game 
to a tie at 12, with the help of Scott 
I-ane and Jeff Ptak. 

The Dons managed to come out 
on top in the end. 

It was one of the greatest games I 
have ever witnessed, not just because 
the Dons won but because of all of 
the other elements like the cheering 
"a comeback. 

It was like the perfect fain' tale 
movie. 

In fact, if it was made into a 



would say about it is that it would be 
too unrealistic. 

Media was scrambling to get 
interviews and all 1 could do was sit 
back and enjoy it. It was truly 
wonderful. 

The same weekend the Shrine 
Circus came to town, the hysteria 
generated in the gym gave it a circus- 
like atmosphere that I wish everyone 
could have shared.

College recrui ters 
calling!!! 

I've found my home here at 
IPFW, following Arnie Ball and the 
Dons on their path to victory! 



Many times I find myself down 
and disappointed about various prob- 
lems here at IPFW, and often times I 
ask myself if 1 am getting the full col- 
lege atmosphere here. 

Last Friday I was reminded just 
how special and fortunate I am to be 
at IPFW. 

That was when I witnessed the 
excitement of Arnie Ball and IPFW 
Men's Volleyball take on Ohio State 
University, a school 1 thought 1 
would only get to see if I went to IU u 

or Purdue and I only had to travel to crowd and lhc drama f 
the Gates Sports Center. 

Cock)', confident, and confused 
about why they were playing a school 

are when they found 
themselves down 1-0 after 
losing the first game 
15-10. 

Suddenly, Gates 
erupted. Chants were 
screamed, cheerleaders 
cheered, and for the first 
time in my young colle- 
giate career, I was 
immersed in school spirit. 

What made it so 
much better, though, was 
the community spirit 
which was evident as well. 

The place seemed 
painted in blue and white 
with 2,000 screaming fans 
all cheering the Dons on. 

The Dons were up 2 
games to 1, and had a 
chance to nail the coffin 
shut. 

Then the Buckeyes 
started a comeback, which 
not only won them the 
fourth game but also gave 
them a commanding 12-7 
lead through rally scoring, 

All teams, when they 
are down, go to the player
