Diversity Week 
Events 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



Diversity. The very word 
implies a myriad of culture and 
ideas, which is exactly what 
Diversity Week intends to celebrate 

Diversity week kicks off on 
Saturday with a banquet by the 
International Students Organization 
from 6-8:30 p.m. in the Walb 
Ballroom 

Included among the week-long 
activities is a series called "Human 
Jazz: Harmonizing Our Stories." 
which is an exhibit of the AIDS 
quilt panels. 

The panels will be on display in 
the Walb Ballroom. 

On Tuesday, 'Talking About 
Race," will be held in CM 159. 
from 10:30-11:45 am. 

Russian music will also be fea- 
tured in Neff Recital Hall, al 7:30 
pjn. 

"Celebrating Our Students," a 
day of student research presenta- 
tions and projects on women and 
diversity will be held on March 25. 
in Walb 224 from 6-8 p.m. 

The continuous presentations 
by LPFW students will run from 10 
am. -2 p.m. 

Another highlight of Diversity 
Week, is "Volunteensm: Service 
Agency Fair," from9a.m -1 p.m. in 
the KetUei Hall Lobby areas. 

The Service Fair will be held on 
Monday 

The Service Fair is one aspect 
of Diversity Week that Paulina 
Salvador, adviser/coordinator of 
support services for students of 
color, thinks students should not 
miss. 

"Service learning is something 
students should lake seriously," 
Salvador says "It gives students a 
unique learning experience " 

The Service Agency Fair is 



included in Diversity Week because 
becoming a volunteer has the poten- 
tial for expanding horizons, envi- 
ronmentally and socially, she said. 

"It is a great avenue to provide 
an appreciation of diversity in the 
community." Salvador says. 

The community becomes 
involved by way of the many agen- 
cies that have chosen to be a part of 
the fair. 

Over 50 agencies will be repre- 
sented including: Park Center, 
Radio Reading Service. YWCA, 
Artlink, Erin's House and Ihe 
American Lung Association. 

As unlikely as it seems. 
Salvador suggests not volunteering 
for the most familiar agency 

"Ideally, someone would sign 
up for something they know noth- 
ing about and (are able) to grow 
from that," Salvador said. 

As an incentive to participaie. 
students visiting the fair will 
receive valuable vendor coupons 

Although the week applauding 
diversity is packed full of events, 
one week is not enough, said 
Shirley Jones-Sewell. adviser/coor- 
dinator of support services for stu- 
dents of color. 

Both Jones-Sewell and 
Salvador sit on the Diversity Week 
planning committee. 

"I wish more sludents would 
gel involved," Jones-Sewell said 

The diversity council is fortu- 
nate to have worked with the 
Volunteer Connection, which 
served as a liaison between the ser- 
vice agencies and IPFW 

"We couldn't have done 11 with- 
out the Volunteer Connection," said 
Salvador. 

Likewise, Diversity Week can- 
not accomplish its goal of "provid- 
ing awareness of issues, including 
diverse culture and thought without 
student participation," Salvador 
said. 



Professor names adminstrators, 
university in civil suit 



By Nol Beckley 

Editor 

Two lop administrators have 
been named in a defamation suil 
filed in Allen County Superior Court 
bv the chair of the English depart- 
ment on March 13. 

Mary Helen Thuenie said, in her 
suil, "that (Fenwick) English (vice 
chancellor of academic affairs) has. 
by direct statement or innuendo, 
published statements implying she is 
a racist." 

Chancellor Michael Wartctl and 
IPFW were also named in the suit 
because, according to the suit, tbey 
have "adopted, ratified, condoned, 
and acquiesced in this defamation." 

"She has brought this claim 
because she feels her nghts as a cit- 
izen have been violated by the 
administration," said John Theisen, 
attorney forThuente 

Thuenie has also claimed her 
right to free speech and expression 
was violated by Wartell, English and 




the university 
The suit said 
WaneH's actions 
were in direct 
retaliation for 
Thuenle's asso- 
ciation with 
Vickie Beneke. 
who also has 
filed a suit 
against the uni- 
versity, Wartell 
and English for 
defamation and 
discrimination. 
~^^^—^^^— Thuenie 

also cilcd the administration's fail- 
ing to reapprove her as chair of the 
English department despile her 
dean's approval and nearly unani- 
mous approval of professors in the 
department as another instance of 
retaliation. 

In her suil. Thuenie charges the 
defamation was done to her "inten- 
tionally, willfully, maliciously, and 
in bad faith "

cause emotional distress to Thuenie, 
and did in fact cause severe emo-

The first charge of racism 
against Thuenie appeared in Frost 
Illustrated when English was quoted 
as saying "The lack of understand- 
ing on the pan of ihe English depart- 
ment, be said, seemed almost 
racist' in its lack of flexibility" 
about the Summer Bridge program 



English denied this statement in 
a memorandum to Thuenie and sub- 
sequnetiy issued to the faculty sen- 
ale by saying, "No comments or 
insinuations were issued by me or 
my office in this regard " 

In the next paragraph of 
English's memo, he wrote about 
items from the English department 
and Thuenie thai "comprise the data 
base that presents 'the troubling 
appearence 10 some of our con- 
stituencies, i.e. that of racism.'" 

Thuenie sent a letter to Wartell 
asking thai be direct English (o 
retract bis slatmcnt publically She 
also asked that English "cease and 
desist" any other remarks associat- 
ing her with racism After this letter, 
Theisen said the charges of racism 
"intensified" because English's 
memo was circulated across the 
stale. 

"She did make attempts 10 han- 
dle this through appropriate chan- 
nels . . . nothing seemed to happen," 
Theisen said. 



Seniors donate communications package 



By Kathryn Meichsner 
Staff Reporter 



In a few short monihs, this year's seniors will 
no longer be with us. 

However, ihe gift seniors have decided to 
give the university will give back to ihe many 
classes that follow. 

The seniors chose a communications package 
which includes electronic display signs for 
upcoming events, text telephones for the hearing- 
impaired, captioning software for in-class videos, 
lele prom piers and visual fire and emergency 
alarms. 



"It's going to give access on Ihe campus to 
the students who might not have access," said 
Margie Guthrie, counselor for students with dis- 
abilities. 

Although the most visible pan of the benefits 
of the gift will be for disabled sludents, Gulhnc 
said she thinks other students will serve all stu- 
dents. 

"The usage is going to be for more than just 
disabled students," she said. 

"1 think it's fantastic," Guthrie added. 

Seniors chose from three different items to 
give to the university: the communications pack- 
age, a scholarship for pan-time returning adults 
and a senior pan-time scholarship. 



Ihe announcement about ihe gift wdl be 
made ai Ihis year's commencement on May 13. 

Anyone is welcome to make donations 
towards this year's gifu not just seniors. 

The Student Ambassador Council has been 
holding a phon-a-ihon to raise money for (he gift. 

Today is the last day for the phon-a-thon, bul 
donations can be made for the gift until May 8. 

For more information call Christine Smith at 
481-4151 about the phon-a-thon and making 
donations.

The Communicator 



Thursday. March 19. 1998 



March is Women's 
History month 



Bv DODIE MlLLER 

Chief Reporter 



"I am woman, hear me roar," or 
so (he song said li is no coinci- 
dence lhal Women's History Month 
occurs dunng the monlh that comes 
in like a lion. 

Women's History Monlh began 
as a local celebration in Sonoma 
County. Calif., in 1978 From there, 
it crept across the country. 

The idea of celebrating the con- 
tributions and accomplishments 
went national in 1987. after the 
Congressional Resolution proposed 
by the National Women's History 
Project was passed. 

Linda Fox, director of women's 
studies and associate professor of 
Spanish, marvels that there have 
been seven generations of women 
involved in the women's movement. 

That means that women have 
championed for their rights and 
those of their sisters since 1848. 

"This year marks the I50lh 
anniversary of the Women's Rights 
Convention, which was held in 
Seneca Falls, N.Y.," said Fox 

That gathering included such 
notables as Elizabeth Stanton and 
Susan B Anthony. 

The purpose of National 
Women's History Monlh is to reach 



out to women from kindergarten to 
college. 

On a related note, 1PFW was the 
first of either Indiana University- 
Bloomington or Purdue University- 
West Lafayette, to have a Women's 
Studies degree program. The 
Women's Studies program at IU 
began its first year during the fall of 
1997. 

Indiana University-South Bend 
is still in the process of implement- 
ing such a degree program So far no 
Purdue branches have a Women's 
Studies program 

For Christine Zielinski, director 
of the Center for Women and 
Returning Adults. Women's 
National History Month "is a time 
that is devoted to the awareness of 
the developments of the roles that 
women play." 

The focus this year, according to 
Zielinski, is on women athletes and 
women writers. 

The public will be given the 
chance to meet female athletes from 
IPFW and a publication. 
"Champagne and Mustard," will be 
available to the public 

Zielinski explains that the col- 
lection's offbeat tide is representa- 
tive of the wide range of women and 
their talents. 

The writings in "Champagne 
and Mustard" were all written by 
women students, staff and faculty 
from IPFW 



"It is important to note that 
women are a collection of various 
tastes and talents," said Zielinski. 
Different talents will be highlighted 
next year 

Zielinski is concerned (hat 
women athlelcs may not be aware of 
the struggles their predecessors 
endured 

Title IX. which is supposed (o 
guarantee equality among women's 
and men's college spons, is credited 
with opening doors for women ath- 
letes. 

Linda Fox would like for as 
many people as possible (o get 
involved and become educated 
about what women have accom- 
plished. 

"As a program which focuses on 
the contributions of women, it's 
very important (o recognize mile 
stones." said Fox. "You will lean 
something from our programs." 

Besides Women's Naiiona 
History Month, the opportunity (o 
explore women's contributions lo 
(he betterment of their sex 
humanity exists throughout the year 
in offerings of the Women's Studies 
program 

The fact such measures hav 
been taken to salute women's 
accomplishments certainly makes 
1998. in the words of Chrislii 
Zielinski, "the year of the woman.

Need help with your taxes? 

IPFW accounting students offer solutions 



By Gail Ruble Crawford 
News Editor 



IPFW accounting students will 
be providing on-campus and off- 
campus assistance with Federal and 
Indiana tax returns throughout 
March and April. 

This assistance is made possible 
by the Volunleer Income Tax 
Assistance Program (VITA), which 
has been offering free tax assistance 
to taxpayers for over 35 years 

Nationwide, the VITA Program 
is targeted toward lower-income 



taxpayers who qualify for the 
Earned Income Credit. 

The Earned Income Credit is 
available in 1997 to taxpayers with 
two qualifying children, and has a 
maximum of S3.656 

However, anyone needing assis- 
tance with the completion of Forms 
1040-EZ, 1040A. or 1040 is wel- 
come. 

Assistance is available in com- 
pleting Form 1040 and accompany- 
ing schedules on which capital 
gains [Schedule D) and itemized 
deductions (Schedule A) must be 
reported. 

However, taxpayers with more 
complicated returns may be asked 



to take their forms to a paid tax pre- 
parer. 

Accounting students will be 
available on campus every Monday 
from 2 to 4 p.m. and from 6 to 8 
p.m. in Walb Union Rm 222. 

Locally, IPFW accounting stu- 
dents will be available at the East

Staff Editorial: 



Rah, rah, sis boom bah 



After attending some volleyball 
games we have found a facet of 
IPFW thai we didn't know existed. 
Cheerleaders Noi only do we have 
a squad, but we have three of them 

We didn't realize there was such 
a demand from the numerous fans 
that it would constitute three 
squads. 

Now, hold 
on. we are not 
knocking these 
women and men 
for wanting to 
come out and 
cheer for our 
campus. But. 
looking at (be 
size of our cam- 
pus and the num- 
ber of fans in the 
stands, we don't 
understand why 
there are three 
separate squads 



nice if they could have done some 
actual cheering along with those 
pyramids 

When we were at the volleyball 
game against Ohio State there was 
only one squad there This was one 
of the biggest games of the season. 
The bleachers were full; people 
were energetic and ready to cheer 
on the Dons Well, 
all except for 
those other two 
squads of cheer- 
leaders. And the 
basic collegiate 
cheerleader squad 
HAVE SCHOOL SPIRIT AND ^^S' 



..IT IS WONDERFUL TO 



WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE 



WOMEN AND MEN INTER- 



These 



include the Pom 
Pons squad, the 
dance squad and 
then the basic 
collegiate cheer- 
eaders At a 
;recent volleyball 

game all three were present and they 
all did their own thing well. 

The Pom Pons cheered through- 
out the game; the dance squad came 
out for one hide dance and the 
cheerleaders did one cheer then pro- 
ceeded to stand by the doors while 
the men repeatedly lifted the women 
in the squad over their beads. This 
is great Their ability at acrobatics is 
!outstanding, but it would have been 



ESTED IN CHEERING ON 



OUR ATHLETES... 



Once again, they 
stood over by the 
doors and the men 
occasionally lifted 
the women up 
RAH! 

They never lead - 
the crowd in any 
kind of cheer, 
especially when 
our team was los- 
ing. Hello boys 
and girls, this is 
when your joh is 
crucial They 
could have helped 
get the crowd involved, which, in 
turn, could have gotten the Dons 
hack on their feet. But, no. They 
built human pyramids and stood by 
the doors RAH! 

We. again, slate that it is won- 
derful to have school spirit and we 
are lucky to have women and men 
interested in cheering on our ath- 
letes, if they would just actually 
cheer RAH' 




Get out and Hey you! Yeah you, bomb person(s)

Alrighty, I have 
reached the end of my 
rope In support of my fel- 
low students, I have taken 
it upon myself to address 
whomever is responsible 
for the never-ending bomb 
threats here on campus. 
It's just you (and you and 
you?) and me. idiot Let's 
rock. 

1 have a few thoughts 
for you, and I would appreciate it if you would 
think long and hard about them before you pick 
up the telephone again and waste my time or 
anyone else's.

school that you have to resort to committing a 
Class D felony to pui o(f a test? Tests may be 
important, but thev do not constitute your entire

Let it be said- 



The Communicator extends a sincere 
welcome to any and nil members of the 
student body who are interested in work- 
ing for IPFW's student newspaper. We 
are looking for students with diverse 
backgrounds and from ail majors to par- 
ticipate in all sections of the paper. 
Experience is nol necessary. Whether 
you are a writer, artist, photographer, or 
have an opinion about something, be 
assured that your participation will be 
appreciated and will make a difference. 



OF SCHOOL Stop wasting my time and every- 
one else's. It's annoying as hell. And it's not fair 
to everyone who aciually has the nerve to — 
DEAR GOD— study for a test. 

4. Do you have a God Complex or some- 
thing? Is there any particular reason that your 
needs have superceded that of the other 12,000 
studenLs at IPFW'' If you think that you are doing 
anyone besides yourself a 
favor, gel a clue. 

5. It's not as (hough 
calling in a fake bomb 
threat will keep you from 
taking the test eventually 
anyway, you know If you 
didn't study for it the first 
time. I highly doubt thai 
you studied for it the sec- 
ond (or third) time around 
Lazy for round number 
one and probably lazier 
for the second round

"casually" cause the can-

ARE THE RESULT OF THE 



"1 called in bomb threats to my university 
because I wasn't prepared for a lest. Wanna hire 
me?" Think you'll be getting that job? Not unless 
Hell freezes over, and / don't believe that it's 
gonna be that cold any time in this lifetime. Oh, 
and by the way. will you call in a bomb threat to* 
an employer someday because you didn't have 
tune to prepare for a presentation or meeting? 

9. I don't know if you think 
that you are doing the student' 
body a favor by making these I 
threats or what, but no one is'; 
laughing anymore. I'm sure that 
you are familiar with the Aesop 
fable, "The Little Boy Who Cried 
Wolf" What happens the first 
tune that a REAL bomb threat is 
called in? What happens if a 
building on the campus REALLY^ 
blows up? What then? Will you' 
feel guilt? Or do you have no con- 
science? 

10. This is nol a game 1 know 
that you are probably basking in 
the glow of anonymity that you 
have so far been lucky to gel .^ 
However. I'll bet that you haven't 
thought about what will happen 

'hen you get caught-- and you 



outside of classes, they gel licked CHOICES THAT YOU MAKE. WILL get caught. That test that

7. Oh. and there IS that one other litde thing 
that I sure as Hell bet you haven't considered: 
There is a box on job applications that asks. 
"Have you ever been convicted of a felony? If 
so. please describe." 

Well, you idiot. I would like to be the first to 
beat some wrinen sense into your skull and tell 
you that there is a REWARD out on you. It's 
S5.0O0. For S5.0O0, someone WILL turn you in 
to the authorities You could face a $10,000 fine 
and up to a year in PRISON. 

8. When you either pay up or gel out of ihe 
STATE PEN, then you'll have to check thai little 
box on the 'ole job application Now. I could be 



■ere too lazy or hung over to 
study for won '( seem to be all that 
important when you are reflecting 
on it from sour jail cell, now will it 7 

Remember— life is a series of choices. 
Where you go in this life and what you choose to 
do with it are Ihe result of the choices that you 
make Have some guis and quit playing with our 
lives and nerves. After all, there's a $5,000 
reward on your head Hope that you've got loyal,

Sex, the sexes and what's right and wrong 



what's weak this week: Dennis Donahue 



Welcome back everyone Wow, 
Lhis semester cruising along or waal? 
It seems thai iti was only yesterday 
we were getting ready for Christmas 
break Actually, school always seems 
to fly during the Spring semester 

How is everybody feeling? Have 
you gotten rid of your anger and 
resentment towards the profs who 
gave you a test the first week back 
after after break? I have Bui I still 
have a couple of things I would like 
to gel off of my chest (go figure) 

First of all. let's talk about the 
sexes or most importantly, sex. If, 
and I mean if. Clinton did all of the 
things he has been accused of. are 
we to decide what exactly was so 
wrong about them? Was it wrong 
because he is the President? Was it 
because he is an adulterer? Could it 
possibly be because he Led about 
them? 

What about the women 
involved? Let's talk about them. 
Sleeping with a married man is just 
as wrong as a married man sleeping 
around, right? I think these women 
have every right to sleep with 
whomever they want, whenever they 
want. But come on, they are consid- 
ered heroes and martyTS for being 
promiscuous Why isn't America 
condemning their behavior? 

Sure, people do things, but I 
think Monica bad a plan. A very 
devious plan to embarrass the pub- 
lic, the Presidency and the American 
people as a whole. Well the clock is 
ticking Monica 14 minutes and 
about 23 seconds to go in your quest 
for 15 minutes of fame. And is it me 
or has she gained about 20 pounds 
since Ihe story broke? She might 
want to try Slim-Fast This whole 
story must be embarrassing for 
women everywhere 

What about Paula Jones? She 
just doesn't have the evidence either, 
She's white trash. Actually, white 
trash won't even accept her, and 
check out the nose on this broad. 
Couldn't we just lake lie detectors 
and get Ibis whole thing over with? 
My opinion is that Clinton probably 
does have some stuff going on out- 
side of his marriage That alone isn't 
cool. But let the guy run the country! 

The other sex story involves a 
teacher and a Utile boy. Is this hap- 
pening more and more, or are we just 
finding out about it more frequently? 
It goes like this: A female has an 
affair with a 13-year-old boy and 
becomes pregnam. She gets arrested, 
goes to jail, gets out on bail, nails the 
little boy and again, becomes preg- 
nant First lei me say this, it isn't 
funny. But Leno, Letterman and the

whom she trusted as an educator. 
"Oh, the poor little lamb mast have 
been so scared." Give me a break 
With this whole sex thing, why has it 
become from page news? Athletes, 
military personnel and politicians, 
can't people just have affairs like the 
good ol' days? And be careful what 
you say, someone may get offended 
In sitcoms where women com- 
ment on the 'behind' of some cute 
guy. or even rub it and follow it with 
a very sexist phrase, the audience 
loves it A man isn't even given this 
privilege. Defenders of this, mostiy 
women, will argue the point with, 
"You were able to do this for so long, 
it's just our turn." Your turn fur what, 
to be sexist and obnoxious? Go 
ahead, you'll only embarrass your 
sisters I get sick of the double-stan- 
dard I think that it knocks women 
down a peg. It makes them seem like 
the pigs men become in the same sit- 



uation. 

You know, women tell sick jokes 
loo So. don't act all proper if you 
overhear one either, just walk away if 
it offends you. I wish people would 
get iheir sense of humor back. See, 
that's whal it is. a sense of something 
you feel is funny. If it isn't funny, big 
deal. Why waste someone's time 
with petty. "I'm a woman and that 
offends me." just come right back 
with a stupid male bashing comment 
or walk away? 

So. if you are a woman and you 
arc offended by this, sue me or 
walk away. Don't tell someone, six 
months later, that you had sex with 
the President and all of a sudden 
feel really bad about it. 

Since I am on Ihe subject, 
women are smarter than men. Til 
give you that. But, we are physical- 
ly stronger if we were as smart as 
you, we would be able to do all of 
things that you are so good at. 
Things like cooking and cleaning! 
Hey. I'm kidding! God. lighten up 
America. Ii all boils down to 
equality and everyone being treat- 
ed the same. 1 wish this was the 
way it was, but the sides will never 
meet halfway. As long as women 
on the golf course tee off closer to 
the greens than men and get in 
bars free on "Ladies Night," I will 
always feel cheated 

LOSER OF THE WEEK: People 
who bash Bob Knight Just because 
he acts a little crazy, as we all do, to 

some, he is like Satan. Ninety-nine 
percent of this comes from Purdue 
fans who just hate having never won 
a national championship, let alone 
three. Gene Keady acts just as stu- 
pid as Knight does and doesn't gel 
half of the attention. Keady has a 
winning perccniage against Knight; 
Knight has the best graduation rate 
in the Big Ten (2nd in the nation 
behind Duke). So. aside from the 
chair throwing incident, which 
Purdue fans love to bring up and 
other stupid things be does, Coach 
Knight is doing his job he is hired to 
do. You go to school to graduate, 
right 7 Go Stanford!

My parents are ecstatic that

and 1 have to say I'm more than

At the start of this semester 
1 started gelling my resume 
together, WOW! what a project 
thai was. 1 had no clue the 
amount of work and effort that 
was going to entail If I bad I 
would have started iwo years

After 1 had. what I thought- 
was, a solid resume 1 look it 
over to Career Services to have 
them look it over for me. Well. 1 
soon found out I was far from 
having a complete resume.

"And the Oscar goes 10...." 

Il is lhat time of year once again. The evening 
when celebrities dress to kill and mingle with one 
another. The night when (he Academy of Motion 
Pictures Arts and Sciences acknowledges the 
work of men and women in Ihe film industry. An 
occasion where tears will be shed, laughter will 
roar and new stars will be bom. On Monday. 
March 23, Ihe 70th Annual Academy Awards will 
reveal all the answers. The ABC network will be 
airing the event live 

Once again, the extravaganza will be hosted 
by Billy Crystal. This will be Crystal's sixth time 



a bean-fell and interesting siory. 

With all the criticism the film look in produc- 
tion, the Academy is sure to acknowledge 
Cameron's determination. It is a meaningful 
three-hour film that will attain the success thai it 
deserves. It's casi, soundtrack and plot all add up 
10 claim the victory. 

The best actor category brings lour legendary 
actors and a bright new kid on the block. The 
nominees are Peter Fonda. Dustin Hoffman, 
Roben Duvall. Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon. 
The strongest contenders are Fonda and 
Nicholson. 

However, the Academy always loves a 
comeback and this is clearly more evident in 



back story with Bun Reynolds making the grade. 
The audience will have to admil lhat his role as a 
porno film director in "Boogie Nighis" is a little 
belter than his appearance in "Cop and a Half" 
Furthermore, the role was daring, and Reynolds 
look il all the way. With crazy hair and a burly 
chest, the character is one thai surely sticks oui in 
your mind 

The supporting actress category lakes a

This year's nominated films bring out strong

also allowing fresh faces to get into the picture.

On the other side of the film 
specimm are ihe Golden Raspberry 
Awards. These awards go io the 
industry's worst films and perfor- 
mances by aciors and actresses. 
These awards are also known as the 
"Razzies." 

"Barman and Robin" leads the 
pack with ihe most dishonors. The 
film has in all eleven nominations, 
li was nominated for worst film, 
along with "Speed Two: Cruise 
Control." "Anaconda," "The 
Postman" and "Fire Down Below." 
These arc all so horrible thai lo try 
io pick one lo win would be impos- 
sible. 

The Worsl actor nominees 
include Kevin Cosmer for "The 
Posunan." Val Kilmer for "The 
Sainl," Shaquille O'Neal for 
"Steel." Steven Seagal for "Fire 
Down Below" and Jon Voight for 
"Anaconda." I think thai Shai) defi- 
antly should suck to basketball. 
"Steel" was definitely the worst 
version of a Superman character to 
dale. 

The worst actress nominees are 
some really classy ladies. They are 
Sandra Bullock for "Speed Two: 
Cruise Control," Fran Drescher for 
"Beautician and ihe Beast," Lauren 
Holly for both "A Smile Like 
Yours" and "Turbulence," Alicia 
Silversione for "Excess Baggage" 
and Demi Moore for "G.l. Jane." 

I think lhat this is going to be a 
tight race between Fran Drescher 
and Demi Moore. Fran seems to 
annoy everyone wiih her painfully 
grating, vomit inducing voice, 
while Demi uses what little looks 
she has io portray her characters. 1 
feel lhat Demi with gel ihe 
"Razzie" in this category. Just when 
I thought lhat she was at the low of 



her career wiih "Striptease", she 
bottoms oul wiih her performance 
in "G.I.Jane." 

On a further note. I am disap- 
pointed with ihe nominaiing com- 
mittee of the Golden Raspberry 
Awards for not nominating Howie 
Long or his film "Firestorm" for 
any awards. This had io be one of 
the worst movies lhat 1 saw al the 
dollar theatre last year. I wish Mr 
Long belter luck next year. 

The winners wdl be announced 
on March 22.

A Foot Stowp-incjf Good Time 




One of the many memorable segmenls, three performers walk 
and bang around on hollow oil drums 



Bv Jasen Savage 
Staff Photographer 

II was a percussionist's wet 
dream BAM! CRASH! WHAP! It 
all came together last Tuesday in 
the production of "Stomp!" at the 



Embassy 

I arrived early to settle any 
complications that almost always 
seem to arise with photographers. 

After a short inquiry from the 
head honchos, I took my assigned 
place and waited for the show to 




Three performers humorously "drain" their instruments. 



begin. 

The lights went down and all 
hell broke loose! It started out slow 
at first. 

A single performer with a push 
broom in hand began sweeping out 
a bangin' rhythm. 

He was soon joined by the 
other seven performers all doing 
their own individual bits to make a 
whole ensemble 

The brooms soon gave way to 
other household items used 
throughout the evening. 

The entire show was basically 
made up of skits that lasted about 
five to seven minutes each. 

Other "instruments" used n 
plungers. Zippo lighters, boxes 
matches, radiator hoses and ot 
unlikely sound devices. 

Having no dialogue, the sh 
surprisingly had quite a few t 
ments of humor to it. 

One character, with B 
Simpson hair, supplied most of the 
comic relief. 

The audience 
participation segment 
was even funny. 

During this, one 
performer encour- 
aged the crowd to 
repeat the complex 
rhythms be had just 
stamped and clapped 
out, and they would 
answer with the good 
ol' "two bits." 

Other highlights 
included an all-out, 
knock-down jam 
involving the per- 
formers being sus- 
pended from ropes 
*H and banging on 
P objects that were fas- 
tened to the mon- 
strous stage structure. 
The "oil-drum 
walking" was also 
quite memorable.

3 relief of Ihe show slides across the floor on garbage can lids 



I went to Ihe show with the pre- 
conceived nouon thai I would be 
impressed and I was not mistaken 

The entire show was very 
sophisticated, but quite tribal 

The amazing amount of 
rehearsal ume that must have gone 
into this was quite evident. 

Never before have I seen such 
a mixture of dance, percussion and 
theater. 

The next lime this show clat- 
ters tnio the area, I would highly 
recommend catching u. 

Of the eight siompers, six were 
male. Ii was obvious all eight were 



in tip-top athletic shape to be able 
to endure the entire constantly- 
moving show. 

Most ordinary people would 
have been on the floor gasping like 
a fish out of water after the first 20 
minutes. 

"Stomp!" began back in 1991 
as a creation of Luke Cresswell and 
Steve Nicholas. 

The first American run was at 
the Orpheum Theatre in New York. 

It was immediately hailed as 
brilliant and went on to receive 
awards such as the Guardian's 



Critics Choice. 

"Stomp!" can have up to 30 
members in the cast at a lime 
depending on the city the show is 
playing in 

The cast has appeared on the 
Tank Girl Soundtrack" and the 
Quincy Jones album "Q's Juke 
Joint." 

Now it's time for me to siart 
trying lo weasel a Pearl Jam pass

j Pastime deserves 
| respect, not derision 



By Ben Ruble 
Staff Reporter 



As you slare ai the park., you 

- notice the green sod wiih the pet- 
' fecily cm alicmaiing rows. 

I You notice bow beautiful the 
; background behind and above the 
; scoreboard and the stadium lights 
; is at sunset. 

Then you realize that 
| Comiskey Park. Camden Yards, 
■ Wrigley Field, or wherever you axe 

- is really neat. 

Comiskey 's scoreboard bulbs 
j that resemble minLs light up and 
i catch your attention. 

Or you may believe that the ivy 
: on Wrigley's walls is beautiful. 
' Then again, you could be watching 
I a game from the nouvcau antique 
j park of Camden Yards 
; Then you hear someone men- 
; tion how boring baseball is. 

Maybe you beard the comment 
. on the radio, or on the television, 
', from a friend, or wherever. 

Those comments make me 

* want to slap the speaker. 

I remember last year during the 
; World Series, 1 was listening to 
; Slar94.1-FM or 96 3-FM (former- 
; ly known as "The Edge") and 

* announcer Susan Harley slated 

* how boring she thought that base- 
: ball was. 

; She didn't like it inierrupting 
: television shows thai she liked. 
; That comment really imtaied me 
; I do not like it when people 
; make comments about baseball 
; like, "Oh it is so boring." You 
; know what — Shut the hell up!!! 
How many people do you bear 

* put down a boring sport like ten- 
'• nis? 

* Okay, now I have the attention of 
; the tennis fans and players. 

Now, doesn't a comment like 

ithat irritate you &gt; QettCtt think that. 
it was: fair? Do you we mypoint" 
People do not have the right to 



criticize a game thai they do not 
understand. 

How many people who don't 
like baseball know what a putout 
is? Whai about a K 1 Or a fielders 
choice? 

If you can't answer any of 
those questions, then you haven't 
earned ihe right to comment on a 
game that you don't even compre- 
hend. 

I love the game of baseball It 
irrilatcs me when people make 
negative comments on "The 
American Pastime " 

Do you know enough about the 
game to have a valid opinion? 

If you don't have a valid opin- 
ion and you make a negative com- 
ment, don't be surprised if I tell 
you to "Shut the hell up!" 

Baseball is a game about heart. 
Beyond the high contracts and the 
high price of park admission, heart 
is what makes this game like no 
other Ken Griffey Ir and Mark 
McGwire had heart while attempt- 
ing to reach 60+ homeruns last 
year. 

Robin Ventura had enougb 
heart while recovering from a terri- 
ble accident thai broke his foot to 
return to the Son before the end of 
the season. 

Lee Smith has enough bean to 
play for {what 1 believe is) bis 19ih 
season. 

Cal Ripken had enough heart 
lo break Gehrig's record for con- 
secutive games played. 

So don'i look at baseball as a 
bonng game full of greed Look at 
it as an exciting game of a pitcher 
going for a shutout or a no hitter 

Or look at it as a game of Tony 
Gwynn going for .400 and as a 
game of Frank Thomas going for 
the most consistent offensive play- 
er in Ihe American League. 
Baseball is still "The Grand Old 
Ball Game." 
I And if you don't bave,some : 
thing nice to say, then ... well, you 
know how ihe old saying goes

Dons take three on diamond 



By Tony Lauh 
Sports Ewtop. 

What was supposed to be a 
huge weekend for IPFW baseball 
last week turned into a lest of head 
coach Tony Vitiorio's patience 

No his team didn't play bad, 
because most of his learns games 
were rained out. 

"El Nino can kiss my ass!" said 
Viliorio. Seven games were washed 
out in all. but three of them will be 
made up later in the season. 

When the Dons did make it out 
onto the field they won three 
straight games Beating 
Witlmington College 6-S and 10-4 
and then beating lUPUI on Sunday 
4-1. 

Even with his ream nding a 
three-game winning streak Vittorio 
still has reservations about his 
team's performance 

"We haven't played well yet." 
said Vittorio. 

"We have played good defense 
but haven't put together a whole 
game," he added 

The team returns to action this 
week by opening (heir home sched- 
ule and Great Lakes Valley 
Conference (GLVC) play. 

First up on the schedule is Tri- 
Slate The Dons beai them in the 
on 5-4 but they are a pro- 
gram on the nsc Tri-Siatc's biggest 



weakness is a lack of depth in the 
pitching staff which could be trou- 
ble if the IPFW hitters make Tri- 
Siate use its bullpen 

This game will be on Thursday 
at 1 p.m. here at IPFW The hard; 
pan for IPFW is lhal Tri-S tale's j 
strength is grcai defense, which will 
lesl the Icam's patience 

The Dons will travel this week-; 
end to open GLVC play. On 
Saturday Bellarminc will be the 
opponent 

"They have been in the lower 
third of the conference bui they 
have a new coach and he has 
brought in a bunch of new players,"; 
said Viltono 

The middle of the lineup could 
play havoc on the Dons' pitching 
staff if they fall behind in (he count 
early 

The lasi game of the road trip 
will be against Northern Kentucky 
A solid learn thai has fallen on hard- 
limes in the past couple of years; 
will be a tough test. 

"They have the offensive lineup 
lhal could beat anybody on any! 
given day," said Viliorio. 

The real problem lhal faces 
Northern Kentucky is that consis- 
tency is lacking 

The team refuses to be aware 
thai every opponenl can win and it 
has cost them some games that 
should have been won.

more than jusi another win for the

victory meant career win #300. In 
18 seasons at IPFW Ball has 
worked relentlessly to build his

Midwest. He has guided his team to 
three NCAA championship tourna- 
ment appcarcnees and five M1VA 
titles. 

"All this really means is that I 
have been here for a long time and I 
have had the opportunity to coach 
some great players while I have 
been here." Ball said as be 
addressed the crowd 

Ball is currently #6 on the all- 
time wins chart. Al Scales, head 
coach at UCLA, leads the pack with 
918 wins in 35 seasons with the 
Bruins.

Coach Amic Ball has probably 
run through every kind of emotion 
there is in the pasl Iwo weeks 

First his team loses a tough 
maich to Ohio State in five sets that 
kepi IPFW in second place in the 
Midwest Inter collegiate Volleyball 
Association. 

L in, ii bis team continues its five 
year dominance of Quincy Not only 
thai but he captured bis 300ih career 
win as coach. 

After such a rollercoaster of 
emotions, he had about eight hours 
to enjoy the milestone because he 
got his team on a plane to Puerto 
Rico where Ihe Don's crushed all 
comers and captured three straight 
victories.

But ■•'.ti.ii Is worse tban all of this 
is that it isn'l going lo get any easier 
this week. Ball leads his 8-2 
Mastodons id the Coliseum lo face 
two tough opponents back-io-back. 

On Fnday Ihe #13 USC Trojans 
come calling on the Dons to try and 
improve Iheir record. 

The Trojans may noi be the mosi 
experienced learn in the country but 
ihey are very talented 

Szilard Kovacs is one of the best 
mid die -blockers in the nation and 
was ranked 15th nationally in hitting 
as a junior 

Donald Suxho is another huge 
player for the Trojans He ranked 
1 1th nationally in assist percentage 
and sei an NCAA single match 
record by dishing out 129 assits 
against Ohio State in 1998. 

The Dons will have to face just 
as tough an opponeni on Saturday 
when Pacific comes calling. 

The University of Pacific is nol 
ranked nationally bul was a Top 10 
(earn last year and is still trying lo 
find itself this year. 

Gregg Wakeham, a second-ieam 
All-American last year will carry 
Pacific's offense He was named 
player of the week twice last year 
and player of the month for 
February. 

KeAlii Alexander will be start- 
ing ai the setter for the team. He 
replaces Russcl Gan, who led the 
team to its Top 10 finish, but he will 
be hard lo exploit because he played 
in over 54 games last year 

Middle blockers run very deep 
for the Tigers. Three players are 
competing for playing lime at the 
postilion so Hecior Solo and Javier 
Escobar will have to continue to 
increase production keep the game 
under control. 



The biggest threat 

to depression is your 

awareness of it.
