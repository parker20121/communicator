In the Colorado case the editor's "crime" was In print .1 letter to Die editor that 
was critical ol I he black studies program at the college The writer charges that 
while shirieiits enrolled in black studies eonrses were harassed into dropping lln-

The writer asked that his name be withheld because he was afraid of reprisal. 
The editor added a note to the letter reiterating the paper's policy ol running letters 
that do not necessarily reflect the»| onsol the staff, laeulty, administration, etc. 

A black student organization on campus demanded that I he editor be fired for 
printing "reactionary White Uaeisl mows " Ti.ii'.icilly enough, the editor was fired 
and editorial restrictions were placed on whal types of letters could be run. 
Censorship -pure and simple. 

No longer can all points of views have access to Ihe paper's opinion page. No 
longer can the editor present a balanced opinion page. And no longer can the 
students be able to read divergent opinions in their newspaper. 

A minority of students have successfully forced then personal tastes on an 
entire student body. A seleel group has set itself up as censors tor other adult 
college students. And the American university, ihe palace for discussion of all 
opinions and ideas, no longer is, 

Maybe we are being melodramatic willi this issue, but two basic nghls are 
being assailed The sacred cows have changed since the McCarthy era, but the 
poin! is the same. In Ihe name of Ihe public good, self appointed e elisors want to 
restrict the freedom of everyone to read or believe as he wishes. These dangers 

The Communicator makes this pledge lo its readers: we will continue to 
provide a forum (or all ideas and opinions, no mailer how distasteful they may be 
losome. We will not pielmd lo know what the ll'FW community should he allowed 
lo be exposed to. Nor will we allow any person or group to impose such censorship 
standards on Us. 

Wefeel that our readers are adult enough to make then own decisions on whal 
Lo read, Ihink or buy. We suggest that a few others should realize this too.

To Americans, il should include, among other things, Ihe right lo peacefully

That freedom was mil in evidence at Indiana I'urdue Monday afternoon.

Die imitation of the University Lee was here lo present his views and his parlys' 
platform, an offer also accepted by Ihe other candidates lor the Senate seal, 
Republican Richard l.iig.'ir anil Democrat Hireh Bayh. 

During Lee's discourse, he was rudely and repeatedly interrupted by Bayh 
supporters, who were apparently interested only in harassing Ihe candidate One

he had not gone lo college, the sludenl persisled. "Then whal gives you (he right to

Lee answered, "The United States Constitution." 

At this point the Bayh supporter stomped mil of Ihe meeting with flurry of 
obscenities.
