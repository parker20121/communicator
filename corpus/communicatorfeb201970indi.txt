MEETING HELD ON PAID PARKING 



On Wednesday, 
Febuary 11, a subcom- 
mittee assembled to. 
frive students a summary 
of research that has 
been done on the paid 
parkinp issue. The 
panel consisted of Dean 
Manres, B etty Tonsinp 
John Ainly, Mike Lam — 
bornp, and ^Hid McComb. 

After a brief back- 
ground of the paid 
parking problem was 
presented, the facts 
and fipures were enum- 
erated. The projected 
need for the year 1^80 
is 2,740 additional 
parkinp snaces. It is 
estimated that 7,3 8 5 
faculty and students 
will drive cars. With 
one third of this 
necessary additional 
parking space accom- 
modated by asphalt 
surface parkinp and the 
remaining space sup- 
plied by a parkinp par- 
are, the cost would be 
S?, 834, 488. With an 
all surface parkinp lot 
tn.e cost would be 
$1,294,650. 

As there has been 
no allocation from the 
state government for 
parkinp fnoici.ti.es des- 
pite requests from 
Indiana University, 
some alternatives have 
been cited by the Joint 
Parkinp Advisory Com- 
mittee. 

1. No additional spaces 
would be provided 



the problem would go 
unsolved. 

2. Arranpements would 
be made to use the 
coliseum parkinp lot 
and bus service would 
be made available to 
the school. 

3. Enrollment would be 
restricted to only the 
number of students that 
the parkinp lot could 
accommodate. 

4. Parkinp facilities 
would be financed by 
the operating budpet. 

5. A private enterprise 
would be employed to 
rent parking spacer on 

.the school grounds. 
This would run approxi- 
mately $200 per parking 
space. 

6. S e 1 f- s upporting 
parking facilities 
would be initiated. 
Assessment for each 
student would be made 
per credit hour per 
car. This plan is what 
is popularly termed 
"paid parking." 

7. School orpanizations 
would solicit donations 
for payments of parking 
spaces for its members. 

At the end of the 
meeting it was made 
quite clear that in 
order for the committee 
to act in a represent- 
ative manner, they must 
know the opinions of 
the students they are 
representing in regard 
to there above-mention- 
ed alternatives.

THE TRUTH ABOTIT PAID PARKING 

(In recent we^k^ there has been considerable contro- 
versy over the probability of paid parking on this campus. 
A poll of students and faculty showed that approximately 
95% of those polled, opposed paid parking. A "University 
Spokesman" has been quoted as saying that if the students 
understood the reasons that they would be in favor of 
paid parking. Since the reasons have not, as yet. been 
made public this reporter decided to journey to Lafayette 
for herself to bring you the truth about paid parking. The 
following is an interview between the Vice-president for 
Paid Parking, Purdue and this reporter.) 
vppp: Come in, come in. I am always glad to see students. 
Yessir, we are always ^flad to talk to students. Stu- 
dents are what make kymversity great, you know ! 
rep: Very nice office you have here. 

vppp: Oh. it's nothing fancy. These three rooms used to 
be offices for 12 faculty members. But as the univer- 
sity grows, the administrative problems get very 
complex. Very complex. 
rep: You seem quite young to be a vp of a Big Ten 

university, 
vppp: Well, Thank you. Until a couple of months ago I 
was only a Dean. But this parking problem has be- 
come very complex. Very complex. In fact, it can only 
be properly handled on a vp level. I just didn't have 
enough weight to throw around as a Dean to get the 
job done right. But we are in good shape now. We 
are really getting organized to get things done. As 
vp I will have two deans working directly under me. 
One dean will be responsible for paid parking at La- 
fayette and the other dean will look after the regional 
campus paid parking. He will have an office here but 
there will be an assistant dean for paid parking at 
each regional campus to keep him informed, 
•ep: At the Fort Wayne campus the students are not at 
all happy about having to pay a $60 narking fee just 
to replace 300 parking places that will be usurped by 
a new building. A rough catenation shows that there 
are 5,000 equivalent full tim^if&amp;ents and that at $60 
each that comes to $300,000. Isn't that a rather high 
price to pay for one small parking lot, especially con- 
sidering that $300,000 will be coming in every year?

Surprise! By now 
ynu have noticed the 
'iU-PU COMMUNICATOR has 

undergone a change a 

drastic one! No we've 
not gone underground. 
We're still flying high 
and still editing a 
paper but the truth of 
the matter is — we're 
out of money. Of 
course everyone has 
been saying "Who isn't 
out of money" so we're 
not alone in our misery. 
When we returned from 
semester break we had 
hoped to be allocated 
money for 16 more 
issues, instead we re- 
ceived enough for 3» 
When we went back to 
ask for money to. put 
out a paoer on February 
20 — our 13th issue — 
there was no money to 
be had. 

Many people thought 
I had spoken too soon 
in my editorial in the 
October 31 issue. J 
stated, "A third issue 
and the IU-PU COMMUN- 
ICATOR still lives!" I 
don't think I did, for I 
am proud to say right 
now "A thirteenth issue 
and the IU-PU COMMUNI- 
CATOR still lives!" The 

auestion is for how 

longer shall we live? 

Perhaps this will be 
o\.ir last issue, perhaps 
there will be three 
more, or perhaps some 
printing equipment will 
come floatinr down from 
heaven and land in our 
office and we'll con- 
tinue to r^rixil forever 
and ever. Who knows? 
It seems to be a "wait 
:'nrt see" deal. 

So we've scraped up 

enough money to present 

to you our 13th issue 

— in a n' -i;-(&gt;M'-r.'-i]-i].&gt;'d 

form. At the time we 



?&lt;xa*3 



scraped up the money we 
ilso scraped up the 
^oiirage, guts, and gall 
bo make a promise — a 
promise to all at the 
DJ-PU Regional campus — 
and that is: "The IU- 
?U COMMUNICATOR talres a 
solemn vow that it will 
3nce again return in 
the fall of the acad- 
emic year of 1970-71 to 
serve you in the best 
*ray possible." Thank 
you for your support in 
oast times. The Editor 



EJ&amp; Dimr HIDES EVERYTHING

Tuesday §aby went to 
Big Daddy to get the 
"facts of life". But 
you know how things like 
that go and Baby got 
the run — around about 
the £irds and the glees 
and the big cover up 
was crammed down ^aby's 
throat. ^ut ^aby must 
remember that "father 
Knows gest" and if Sig 
Daddy says Baby is too 

young then ^aby -Is 

too young. So Baby 
pick up~ your security 
blanket and crawl back 
into your play pen and 

someday you'll learn 

because some people 
give true answers to di- 
rect questions,, 

Good parallel to 
Tuesday's meeting of 
faculty and students 
concerning the Horowitz 
case, donH you agree? 
Concerned students in- 
terested in academic 
quality had the will _ to 
do something-this being 
to try and help rein- 



state Professor Joel! 

Horowotz. When it was 
learned that the Pro- 
fessor' s contract was 
not being renewed for a 
third year, students 
circulated petitions 
for his reinstatement. 

And as another ste^ 

this meeting was es- 
tablished to GET BOTH 
SIDES OF A VAGUE- STORY! 
Well, we had one 
side of the story when 
we went to this meeting 
and hopefully we went 
in with a certain degree 
of ouen — mindedness. We 
went in with a promise 
to listen to the other 
side of the story. Yes 

we went in and we , 

came out wfcth our old 
one side of the story, 
a disgusted feeling, 
and one hour of our 
short lives was gone. 
Nothing was done, no- 
thing was accomplished. 
What was the purpose 
of this meeting? Some- 
body better remind me 
again. 



pp: Glad you asked that Question. I always like to have 
students ask questions. That's the way you learn, you 
know, ask questions. The answers are all right here 
in this report that I have been preparing for the past 
two years for the trustees. As you can see :rrom the 
report we could wall-to-wall carpet a 800 car parking 
lot with Dupont 501 Nylon for only $14,000. No. the 
problem is a lot more complex than the students realize. 
That is one of the problems with the youth of todav. 
They just won't take the time to see how really 
complex some of these things are. Really complex. Here 
is. the detailed breakdown on why we need, why we 
must have that $300,000 a year from Ft. Wayne. 

Cost of paving parking lot $ 5,000 

Paint for stripes 35 

Additional "Staff Parking Sign" 65 

Assistant Dean for paid parking, Salary 20,000 

Office secretary 2,900 

A^dministrative expenses 1,000 

Travel for coordination 2,000 

Ten additional Campus Police to patrol naid 

parking. @$10,000 each, „...100,000 

Guns for additional police, @ $100 1,000 

Ammo., target practice &amp; targets 2,000 



One year supply, parking ticKets 50C 

Additional patrol ear &amp; maintenance 7,50C 

Pro-rata costs for Lafayette administration 57,500 

As you can see for yourself, this all ads up to exac 

the $300,000 that we expect to raise from Fort Way: 

rep: Wouldn't it be simpler and a Tot less expensive to ji 

have open parking where ey&amp;rybody parks on a fir 

come, first-served basis ?jdE^8ii the faculty has co 

iplained that they can't ma parking places anyw 

The secretaries, clerks, janitors, etc. fill up the sti 

lots before the faculty even arrives. Why not just e;i 

inate decals, patrols, courts, and all the other irritatioi 

Vppp: What you the advocating is anarchy in the park: 

lot. It would never work. We have never done anyth 

like that before. The trustees would never stand 

that a minute. Other universities may knuckle uni 

to anarchy but, believe-you-me, we know how to f 

up to complex situations here in Indiana. This is 

complex problem. Very complex. 

rep: Than£you very much for your time, Mr. VP. 

vppp: Any time, any time. We are always glad to talk 

students. Students are what make a university gr&lt; 

yjou know.

Three new vacancies, 
headed the agenda for 
the Febuary 16, 1970 
meeting of the Student 
Assembly. Petitions can 
be picked at the u ffice 
of student ^ervices. 

Next on the agenda 
was a suggestion by Dug 
Schrock to pay the year- 
book debt with funds 
from the athletic fees. 
So the issue was tabled 
until the next meeting. 

The notion to recon- 
sider Mauice -^mery's 
motion of the February 
10, 1970 meeting con- 
cerning the Communicat- 
or's lack of funds and 
the incurring of further 
debts was announced by 
John Ainley to been out 
of order. The matter 
was dropped without dis- 
cussion, 

John Ainlay also sug- 
gested to forego disus- 
sion on a constitutional 
amendment to create two 
additional °enate seats 
in view of the three ra9- 
icrnat i ons announced ear- 
lier, and this matter 
was also dropped- from 
the agenda. 

Mike Nusbaumer then 
introduced discussion on 
the proposed policies 
and procedures for ral- 
li' : and moved accept- 
ance of the rally pro- 
posal. It was seconded 
by ^harles Rossman and 
discussion followed. 
' i 'hr previous question 
was then called and the 
acceptance of the acticn 
was unanimous. 



Mike Nusbaumer then 
requested S60.00 for the 
purchase of 1,000 but- 
tons to be used to pro- 
mote the /?pril 22 Envi- 
ronmental Teach — In 
Betty Tonsing moved that 
the Student ^enate allo- 
cate from the Student 
Senate fund ^60.00 to 
cover the cost of the 
Environmental Teach-In 
buttons. Mike Nusbaumer 
seconded the mmtion. 
Doug Schrock suggested 
an amendment to Miss 
Tonsing's motion that 
the allocated sum be re- 
paid to the Student Sen- 
ate funds from the sale 
of the buttons. The 
proposed amendment was 
seconded by Charles 
Rossman and was accepted 
by Betty Tonsing as a 
friendly amendment. The 
question was called and 
the motion carried. 

John Ainlay then com- 
missioned Dave i^uance to 
post the three vacancies 
in the Student Senate 
directly following the 
meeting. 

Mark Souder asked 
that Frank Akey be ap- 
proved as Supreme O urt 
Justice. Mike Nusbaum- 
er moved the acceptance 
of Frank Akey as a Jus- 
tice, and it was secon- 
ded by Doug Schrock. 
The motion carried. Mr. 
Souder also asked tie- 
Student Senate to con- 
sider a constitutional 
amendment changing the 
date of elections to the 
Tuesday and Wednesday 
before Harborarbor Days 
to be discussed at the 
next meeting of the San- 
ate.
