Appointees To Dean

Paid Parking, the Indiana Stu- 
dent Association meeting, and the 
Dean Search Committee, and the 
Campus Parliament Committee. 

Alter Steve Pettyjohn's presen- 
tation of 2,201 signatures for the 
paid parking petition, the forma- 
tion of the official Student Gov- 
ernment stand on paid parking. It 
goes as follows: "Be it resolved: 
that the Student Assembly of the 
I.U.-P.U. Fort Wayne Campus is 
unanimously opposed to the stu- 
dents of the I.U.-P.U. Fort Wayne 
Campus shouldering the burden of 
paid parking in any form." In 
addition, Mark Souder's letter 
concerning the paid parking issue 
was read and will ultimately be 
disclosed lo all newspapers, and 
various legislators in Indiana. 

It was reported that at the last 
Indiana Students Association meet- 
ing plans were made for a film 
which will bring to light the 
problems and other aspects of 
college life in Indians. The film 
will be financed by General Mo- 
tors. Plans were also made for a

held April 22, 1970. Anyone who 



is interested in participating in the 
teach-in ahoud contact either 
Mark Souder or Mike Nusbaumer.

th Campus Parliament Committee. 
Two of these will be the calendor

Americans for Freedom was post- 
poned until the next Senate meet- 
ing.

Warnock Tells Of 
Campus Problems 

Mr. Warnock, Chief of Safety

the duties of the safety and se- 
curity staff. They arc charged 
with the safely of students, faculty

all criminal 

dents occuring on campus. 

Mr. Warnock stated there arc 
too many parking violations and 
the students and faulty should ob- 
serve the rules and regulations 
closer. He said the one thing that 
bothers him is the students and 
faculty members carrying food 
and dring out of the cafeteria, and 
smoking in restricted areas. 

When asked if the same park- 
ing and traffic rules that applied 
to the students also applied to 
the faculty, he said, "Definitely." 

Mr. Warnock has been with 
I.U.-P.U. cince August 16, 1966. 
He is married and has three mar- 
ried daughters. 



Lamborne has traveled widely 
in the U.S. and says that he 
"hasn't missed any slates east of 
the Mississippi." He is an "avid 

golfer" who consistently shoots in 
the mid-70's. 

Says Lamborne concerning his 
education, "It is quite possible to 
get as good an education at the 
Regional Campus as on the main 
campus, if not better. There is as 
good a staff here as that of any 
university in the country." He cre- 
dited in particular Mr. Michael C. 
Downs and Mr. Dwight F. Hen- 
herson who encouraged him in 
political science and history.

Paid Parking „ — ^^ 

Don't Knock It If You Haven't Tried It 



Upon awaking, I knew this was a day of change. The 
board of Directors and I had just yesterday initiated the 
greatest thing that had so far happened while I was in office. 
We had initiated a Paid Parking system. We used to have 
a terrible problem with parking. Everyone parked where they 
pleased, even in restricted areas ! But no more ! Paid parking 
ia here. The student has to pay for his parking now. What 
a relief it will be to have my very own parking space. None 
of those dumb students can park in my spot now, why, 
they wouldn't dare! 

Charging into the paid parking lot, I aimed my Mighty 
Mustang toward Paid Parking space number 13. But low and 



bi-'lmld, .some student has parked his car in my place! Some- 
body is gonna catch it for this, you just wait and see. But 
wait, that's no student car. Oh no, it can't be. It's the safety 
and security truck, and they parked in MY PAID PARKING 
SPACE ! Those idiots. Just wait until I get inside, I'll straigh- 
ten those blockheads out, just you wait and see. 

Now where am I going to park? Oh no, not way out 
there. Not out there in that swamp? With all those animals? 
All those wild, savage, students? This can't be happening to 
me, I am Dean of this institution, and nobody does this to me. 
Paid Parking is perfect, nothing like this is supposed to 
happen! — John Courtney

ISA Goals Explained 
By Student Government 



The Indiana Student At 

on was formed as a result oE a 
commitment made by Indiana Sec- 
retary of State Bill Salin to the 
students who marched on the stale 
capilol last Spring. He promised 
form a committee of student 
eminent leaders to serve as a 
UO jSOn with Governor Whitcomb 
and the Indiana Legislation. 

The ISA held its first meeting 
early last summer and has held 
.i-'iiln monthly meetings since 
men. The meetings are usually 
hed in Indianapolis, the last being 
held November 23. At present only 
state-supported universities may 
belong, of which there are thirteen 
campuses. The ISA is presently 
"inside ring opening membership 
all college campuses in Indiana. 
Each campus has two voting 
delegates. The two voting delegates 
'rom Indiana-Purdue University 
t Fort Wayne are Mike Nus- 
aumcr and Mark Souder. Others 
■'ho have altended meetings in- 
clude Bruce Slier and Tom Ncw- 

Thc group is guided by the 
Steering Committee, which con- 
sists of six members. Mike Nus- 
baumcr of Indiana-Purdue was re- 
cently elected to this leadership 
core. Other members are Randal 
Eckley, chairman, of Purdue- 



North Central; Wayne DeGoey of 
Purdue-Calumet; Tim Mains of 
Ball State; Rick Sutton of In- 
diana-Kokomo; and Jeff Emer- 
son of Purdue-Lafayette. 

The main activity of the ISA 
is centered around its committees. 

one and two (of six) were com- 
bined at the last committee meet- 
ing into the Tax Reform and Uni- 
versity Budget Study Committee. 
Mark Souder of Indiana-Purdue 
was elected chairman. Other per- 
manent committees are the Board 
of Trustees Relations, Reduction 
of Voting Age, Student Campus 
Problems and Public Relations. 
Ad hoc committees presently are 
the Student Rights-Code of Con- 
duct and Pollution Teach-In com- 

The committee centered in Fort 
Wayne is charged with a two- 
fold purpose. The first is to de- 
velop a student-backed plan for 
tax reform. Secondly, the com- 
mittee will he responsible for de- 
veloping student participation in 
the university budget requests to 
the Indiana Legislature, as well 
as lobbying for them. 

The ISA represents a group of 
all-ready overworked student lead- 
ers trying to accomplish statewide 
student goals by working through 
the system. 



Letters 
to the editor 



Dear Editor: 

Regarding Don Stuckey's arch- 
aic statement concerning inferior- 
ity of women- 
Item: The Bible is a book of 
superstition. It has no authority 
in logical argument. 

Item: Women are people. Those 
women who chose to waste their 
intelligence in a breeding occupa- 
tion are disgraceful to woman- 
hood. 

Item: Women and men arc dif- 
ferent. Cherish this. Women arc 
not inferior unless victims of 
propaganda. 

Item: Some people always build 
their status and self image at the 
expense of othrs. Stuckey's mas- 
culinity is not worth two cents if 
built on the slavery and degrada- 
tion of the opposite sex. 

Item: Educated women arc es- 
sential to the development of our 
society. Discrimination against 
women will guarantee societal 
collapse. 

WOMEN OF THE WORLD 
UNITE!

The Dark Side 
Of The Moon 

by Eric Sevareid 

This, thank goodness, is the first warm and balmy night 
of the year in these parts: the first frogs are singing. Al- 
together this is hardly the night for whispering sweet senti- 
ments about the reciprocal trade act, the extension thereof. 
But since we are confined, by tradition, to the contemplation 
of public themes and issues, let us contemplate the moon. 
The lovely and luminous moon has become a public issue. 
For quite a few thousand years it was a private issue; it 
figured in purely bilateral negotiations between lovers, in 
the incantations of jungle witch doctors and Indian corn 
planters. Poets from attic windows issued the statements 
about the moon, and they made better reading than the 
mimeographed handouts now being issued by assistant secre- 
taries of defense. 

The moon was always measured in terms of hope and 
reassurance and the heart pangs of youth on such a night 
as this; it is now measured in terms of mileage and foot- 
pounds of rocket thrust. Children sent sharp, sweet wishes to 
the moon ; now they dream of bluntnosed missiles. 

There must come a time, in every generation, when those 
who are older secretly get off the train of progress, willing 
to walk back to where they came from, if they can find the 
way. We're afraid we're getting off now. Cheer, if you wish, 
the first general or Ph.D. who splatters something on the 
kindly face of the moon. We shall grieve for him, for ourself, 
for the young lovers and poets and dreamers to come, because 
the ancient moon will never be the same again. Therefore, 
we suspect, the heart of man will never be the same. 

We find it very easy to wait for the first photographs 
of the other side of the moon, for we have not yet seen the 
other side of Lake Louise or the Blue Ridge peak that shows 
through the cabin window. 

We find ourself quite undisturbed about the front page 
talk of "controlling the earth from the moon," because we do 
not believe it. If neither men nor gadgets nor both combined 
can control the earth from the earth, we fail to see how they 
will do so from the moon. 

It is exciting talk, indeed, the talk of man's advance 
toward space. But one little step in man's advance toward 
man — that, we think, would be truly exciting. Let those who 
wish try to discover the composition of a lunar crater; we 
would settle for discovering the true mind of a Russian com- 
missar or the inner heart of a delinquent child. 

There is, after all, another side— a dark side — to the 
human spirit, too. Men have hardly begun to explore these 
regions; and it is going to be a very great pity if we advance 
upon the bright side of the moon with the dark side of our- 
selves, if the cargo in the first rockets to reach there consists 
of fear and chauvinism and suspicion. Surely we ought to 
have our credentials in order, our hands very clean and per- 
haps a prayer for forgiveness on our lips as we prepare to 
open the ancient vault of the shining moon. 



Student Government Comment . 
rConifnurf from Page Tim) 
Dear Editor: 

Your paper has been having a 
number of articles about our stu- 
dent government trying to foster 
a better understanding between 
the students and their government. 
Recently, in a letter to all organi- 
zations, our Secretary of the In- 
terior, Jim Brown, asked that all 
organizations submit to him a list 
of the officers of the organization, 
the number of members in the or- 
ganization, and the activities of 
the organization for the year. This 
information in itself is not asking 
a lot from each organization, but 
in a follow-up letter the Honorable 
Mr. Brown said that if this infor- 
mation were not given to him that 
the Student Senate would review 
that organization's charter and the 
organization would be "declared 
defunct." 

Tlie question now is does Mr. 
Brown have the right to do this? 
Can he call for an organization's 
charter to be reviewed and then 
"declare it defunct" because it did 



Witt,.,,

not comply with his wishes? An 
organization works hard for its 
charier. They are not given out on 
a whim. The members have to

to be acceptable to the Senate.

ith the wishes of one 
.. _ department of the gov- 
ernment does it seem fair to send 
out threatening letters saying that 
the organization will he "declared 
defunct" if it does not comply? 
Does our Secretary of the Interior 
have this right? Will this prove 
to be the pattern of relations be- 
tween the organizations on our 
campus and our elected govern- 
ment? Will organizations be 
threatened with revoking of their 
charter if they do not comply with 
the wishes of the student govern- 
ment? If this is not the case, it 
seems to me that Mr. Brown was 
overstepping his bounds in de- 
manding the information.

With A Tear . .

With our bad trips we are burning 
With our good trips we are learning 
With our hand we are touching 
With our mind we are searching 
With our eyes we are yearning 
With our hearts we are concerning 
With our feet we are wandering 
With our love we are foundering 
With our hate we are killing 
With our greed we are stealing 
With our curses we are damning 
With our insults we are slamming 
With our land we are ruining 
With our guns we are crueling 
With our money we are drooling 
With our leaders we are bullying 
With our people we are ruling 
With my poem I am saying 
With a tear we better start praying. 



Student Government 
Comment 

by Mark Souder, Student Body President 

At the last meeting of the Indiana Student Association, 
Jeff Emerson, a delegate from Purdue-Lafayette, provided 
us with additional information regarding a Pollution Teach- 
in. The project was originally referred to as a Moratorium 
on Pollution, but the name was changed because it was felt 
the word "Moratorium" gave a false impression of the goals. 

If "Moratorium" was used, it would inevitably be com- 
pared with the Vietnam Moratorium held as a nationwide 
effort in support of a specific solution to the Vietnamese War, 
from which, to say the least, there is substantial dissidence. 

The Pollution Teach-in goal is to discuss solutions to 
pollution, more specifically, water and air pollution. Every- 
body is against pollution, but few people understand the 
causes or have any idea how to solve it. 

Therefore, some student leaders have decided to urge 
all citizens to participate in a Pollution Teach-in on April 
122, 1970. The movement is bi-partisan in effort. Co-chair- 
men of the project are Senator George Murphy, a Republi- 
can from California, and Senator Gayford Nelson, a Demo- 
crat from Wisconsin. 

The Indiana Student Association gave the project their 
enthusiastic support. Led by Purdue, the other campuses 
arc trying to gain student support. The students of the 
Gary and Calumet campuses know what pollution is like. 
We students at Fort Wayne should add our support to 
this movement, because pollution is staring us right in 
the face. We must stop it before it chokes us. 



Mrs. Silverman- 

A Servant Of The Theatre 



Speech professor, Mrs. Margie 
Silverman had been in Fort 
Wayne only a short time when 
she stopped going to the New- 
comers' Club meetings. Far from 
anti-social, she had become deep- 
ly involved in theatre work and 
had time for little else except an 
occasional game of bridge. She 
likes to sew; she sews costumes 
for the Civic Theatre. She joined 
the Civic Women's Guild and 
taught creative drama at the Civ- 
ie's You theatre. Almost every facet 
of the theatre interests her. She 
had acted in many plays; Inst 
season she was in "The Boys 
From Syracu=e," and "The Man 
Who Came To Dinner." She di- 
decled "The Owl and The Pussy- 
cat" for the Three Rivers Festival. 

Theatre is a Silverman family 
project. Mr. Silverman, who is in 
public relations at Magnavox, di- 
rected the play "The Women" at 
the Civic; daughter Julie, a sixth 
grader, had a small role in the 
play. The husband and wife por- 



trayed Lord and Lady MacBeth 
the Civic's latest play. Their s 
John, a senior at South Side, h 
a small role in "MacBeth" w: 
his parents. John was the Artful 
Dodger in "Oliver" at the Franke 
Park Theater Inst summer; bro- 
ther Jeff, a sophomore at South, 
was another of Fagin's merry 
pickpockets. 

Mrs. Silverman received her 
A.A. in theatre at Christian Wo- 
men's College in Columbia, Mis- 
souri, She studied at the Uni- 
versity of Kansas for her B.A. 
and got her M.A. from the Uni- 
versity of Denver. She taught crea- 
tive droma in Baltimore before 
moving to Fort Wayne. 

In Speech 114, Mrs. Silverman 
gives a mass lecture on vocal and 
physical delivery. But she really 
enjoys the sit divisions she has 
in which students deliver their 
speeches. Here, she says, she can 
become better acquainted with her 
students, and she gets to listen to 
many interesting opinions. 



Views On 
Vietnam 



An interview with 

Garten W. Funneil 

A friend of mine returned to 

school this year after spending 

his time in the Murines. I asked

about V

re going on it

the war. 


"Wayne

'ice right

"No, in

college." 






■The w 


r was ju 


t starling then 



"Yes, President Johnson 
ordered the troops into Viet! 
"Were you drafted?" 
"No, I was feeling very pntrio- 

"Because of die demonstra- 

'Thc demonstrations against the 
War weren't well known then. I 
believe in a free country. I was 
horn right after World War II, 
I developed a keen sense of free- 
dom." 

"You joined up Just becouse 
you were patriotic?" 

"Yes. We won our independence 
from England with the help of 
the French. With that fact in mind 
I joined the service." 

"Did it take very long lo get 
you shipped out?" 

"No, I received the all-free ex- 
pense paid trip very quickly." 

"What was Vietnam like?" 

"It was very' hoi — but the peo- 
ple were kind.' 

"The Vietnamese are ignorant, 

"Ignoront of freedom. The peo- 
ple that I met on the local level 
were willing to learn. They had a 
small sense of value of freedom, 
too. They need teachers. The Am- 
erican troops are teaching the 
Vietnamese troops and those men 
in turn are teaching the women 
and children. It's going to take 
a while, tho, till the citizens real- 
ize what freedom really is." 

"Did anything happen that 
made you feel defeated?" 

"The milk strike was on here, 
while we were there. Can you im- 
agine powdered milk that tasted 
watery — and seeing whole milk 
being dumped? We did have tele- 
vision there. We only received 
fresh milk once in six months. 
That gave us a slight feeling of 
giving up." 

"What are your feelings of the 
demonstrations that are going on 
at the present lime about the war?" 

"When I finished my tour and 
came back to the States, I had 
the feeling that everyone has the 
right lo protest — that is one of 
iheir freedoms — but those who 
protest should be sure of who 
they are hurting. After I started 
school again, I see so many peo- 
ple protesting a war that they say 
has no meaning. It docs hove a 
meaning. It means freedom for 
the Vietnamese. THE PEOPLE 
WANT TO BE FREE — THEY 
MUST HAVE HELP" 

"The protestors have a right to 
protest, but why not use the ener- 
gy for helping the people leant 
what freedom is, instead of de- 
stroying those ideas."

warm-blood scent in the wind 
Vampire bats, half human, 

are filling the nights 
Shrieking their terror in 

death- wails 
The preistess, thirteen one, 

carries the death mask 
Within a red velvet cape and 

his face is hidden 
The twelve immortal wear robes 

of cold black 
Their sacred vows taken; 

Eaten of the mushroom's 

magic power 
Til our guts have soured of it 
Retching our addiction to the 

blasphemous vows 
The very earth polluted with 

the hideous vomit 

We've danced nude warming our 

bodies with the child's blood 
Whetting our appetites with its 

warm salty taste 
The pin stuck through the 

doll's soul 
We've touched the very jungles 

with hell 
Burned them with our voodoo fire 

til even the tigers fled 
The salted and barren earth 

The coven, complete; 

witches and warlocks 
Are the leaders and the gods 
The astrologers were wrong, 

the sun rises in scorpio

The damp fog of spring 
Is a haze of vague shadows 
Waiting to take form.

Student Offers Solution 
To College Boredom 



The following essay was written 
liy a sophomore; A student at II 
Port Wayne. For those of you who 
are trying to educate students — 
read it and weep. For those of you 
who are in a position to make 
changes — what can we do for 
such a student, surely the very 
person we most want NOT to 
lose? 

HIGHER EDUCATION 

Barrett Wendell's contention 
that every American citizen should 
receive the Bachelor's degree at 
birth is merely the logical exten- 
sion of the current attitude toward 
that degree. The attitude is in it- 
self deplorable; the fact that it is 
a valid evaluation of the current 
educational system is appalling. 
The bachelor's degree, while ra- 
pidly declining in educational 
value, has risen to occupy a posi- 
tion of considerable social pres- 
tige. Ostensibly granted as the 
culmination of four years of rig- 
orous study and intellectual en- 
deavor, the degree is today more 
a measure of stamina and econo- 
mic status than academic achieve- 
ment. One's progress through the 
esoteric echelons of undergraduate 
education will be a fatal idealistic 
shock, unless the pseudo -intellec- 
tual mists are parted to reveal the 
realities of "higher education." 

The entering freshman has 
similaled the classic belief that 
college is challenging, exciting 
and intellectually stimulating. He 
enters the first class prepared to 



grapple with unfamiliar concepts 
and to "grow" or perish in the 
attempt. He discovers that ex- 
tinction from ennui is much the 
more likely of the prospects. The 
student who seriously wants to be 
educated (as opposed to those who 
are merely "going to college" os 
one visits the dentist, out of nec- 
essity) must spend his first year 
in such inspiring courses as gen- 
eral biology (a repetition of his 
freshman course in high school), 
American history (on the prin- 
ciple that twelve years of memori- 
zation has not resulted in a hasic 
knowledge of one's country). En- 
glish composition, (in which, too 
often, he discovers that the "How 
I Spent my Summer Vacation" 
school of writing is alive and 
flourishing), and other courses 
whose contents are so familiar 
that only the absence of bells at 
the conclusion of the hours dis- 
tinguishes the university from 
high school. The next three years 
are Utile better. 

The one concrete educational 
value of the university would seem 
to be the opportunity for students 
to live away from home, an oppor- 
tunity high schools cannot offer. 
One can't help but feel that sum- 
mer camps ably serve the same 
purpose. 

The individual whose education- 
al aspirations include learning to 
critically examine ideas, and to 
think logically and with clarity, 
must turn to other sources. He 



may, if he 13 extraordinarily de- 
termined, find time among the 
welter of busy work his college 
courses demand, to read, think, 
and discuss ideas with friends. If 
not, he will graduate in the stand- 
ard four years with a crammed 
memory bank, and a pathetically 
undernourished mind. 

Graduate school is essential if 
one hopes to gain anything be- 
yond the better-paying job, held 
as a carrot before the noses of 
the gullible mass of students. But 
in many cases, grad school comes 
four years too late, four years of 
tedium, stagnation, and rare flash- 
es of learning that may or may not 
be sufficient to sustain a student's 
interest and hope. The futility and 
awful expense of four years of 
undergraduate study cannot be 
offset by the magic key of a de- 
gree that allows one to enter grad- 

The granting of bachelor's de- 
grees at birth, or Hutchins' hardly 
less radical suggestions of locally 
organized colleges whose courses 
would determinate for the student 
at betwen 18 and 20 years of age, 
woud eliminate the- purely pres- 
tigious degree seekers and colle- 
giales from university halls as well 
as satisfying seekers of whi 
collar jobs. The university would 
then be freed from the ncce 
of catering to the many, 
could concentrate on nurturing 
the mind us the source of idi 
and crystallizer of concepts. 



Gottlieb On Pollution 



The following arc excerpts from 
Dr. Gottlieb's address at the Citi- 
zen's Briefing on Air Pollution 
November 24 in Fort Wayne. 

"The air this planet was en- 
dowed with is all the air wc have, 
no new supply of air is available 
to us." 

'"The modern smog consists of 
a diabolical witches brew of ir- 
ritant gases produced by a com- 
plicated scries of chemical re- 

"Public apathy was not dis- 
covered by the present generation 
of college students." 

"Last year, approximately one 
hundred forty-three million TONS 
of air pollution was spewed forth 
into our atmosphere and all of it 

". . . Pollutants decrease the 
normal defense mechanisms of 
the lung (ciliary action, mucus 
production) so as to make the 
lungs more sensitive to infection — 
especially to disease such as pneu- 
monia, TB and influenza." 

"42,000 parts per million of 
carbon monoxide are found in 
cigarette smoke. This prevents 
blood hemoglobin from combining 



with oxygen." 

"Cigarette smoke contains fifty 
times the dangerous concentration 
of carbon monoxide." 

"Cigarette smokers . . . world's 
rudest people . . . unmitigated 
clods . . . infringe on the rights 
of others." 

"Am I not entitled to breathe 
fresh, unpolluted air?" 

"We ore a struggle to survive 
our prosperity." 

"The right to inhale pure air 
transcends anyone's right to pol- 
lute it." 

"Life is worth more than 
money." 

"The time has come ... All 
that is needed is the national will 
to clean up the air!" 

We all contribute to air pol- 
lution. By working with nature 
in its ecological entirety man can 
realize his highest potential. 

"Our toleration of air pollution 
manifests a deranged view of ife 
in which private values run wild 
over public values." 

Air pollution adversely affects 
the efficiency, work habits and 
altitudes of people.

Phfifearaphyl 



by Pam Tealsan 

With ihe formalities of photo- 
graphy out of ihe way, the authors 
thought it would be interesting to 
have a few articles devoted to 
animal photography. As our first 
subject, therefore, we choose to 
cover the problems, and the plea- 
sures, of cat photography. 

Cats are one of the hardest 
domestic animals to photograph. 
Becau-e of this, cat photography 
provides an interesting challenge 
to the photographer. Cats and kit- 
tens are photographic naturale. 
Kittens arc unpredicliblc and have 
irresislable charm. Cats, on the 
other hand, are secretive, moody, 
and self-absorbing. 

Patience is, without a doubt, 
the prime requisite in photogra- 
phing cats. For an especially alert 
pose, catnip can be used, as an 
aid, because everyone knows how 
cats react to catnip. Cream may 
also be used to keep a cat at a 
given spot for a fixed pose. 

Expression in cats and kittens 
comes from their eyes. For an 
alert or amazed look, the eye and 
the iris must be round. This is 
obtained only with flash or speed- 
light. The natural curiosity of a 
kitten is also an advantage. Here, 
the cat's owner could be of great 
help. 

The actual technique of photo- 
graphing cats presents certain 
problems. The first thing to do is 
to restrict the area of movement 
of the animal. A familiar spot is 
preferable, such as a table top, 
hassock, pillow, or rug. This sim- 
plifies focusing and the effective 
use of depth of field. 

There are five important funda- 
mentals of cat photography. These 
are ihe use of correct shutter 
speeds, lighting, backgrounds, e 
quipment, and, of course, film. 

Extremely fast shutter specdi 
may be used in two cases: out 
doors, where cats are naturally 
restless and easily distracted, and 
indoors, when movements of play 
arc photographed. Indoor ad " 
must be photographed with fl 
bulbs or speedligbt. The latte 
far the better light for stopping 
action, with a duration of 1/2000 
of a second flash. When using 
flash, the shutter should be set 
1/200 or higher. Fast ponchi 
malic films arc recommended for 
pictures for a "furry" feeling. 

There are three types of light- 
ing available: sunlight, flash, and 
floodlighting. Bright sunlight 
best; hazy sunlight tends to flatten 
the tcxlural quality. Flash is im- 
portant in action shots. It pro 



ind Coral Soule 

lighting is the most effective of 
the three. Sunlight effects can be 
obtained. Softness can be given 
ise of the control of the light. 
Also, cats are more quiet under 
floods than any other type of light. 
Simple backgrounds are best. If 
light background is required, 
is belter to light it separately 
with a flood. The best procedure 
is to plan the background care- 
fully in order to accent the sub-

Winter and Penny 
Carnivals Planned 

The Winter Carnival and the 
Penny Carnival were topics for 
discussion at the Student Union 
Board meeting the 24 November. 
A flyer containing information 
' it the Winter Carnival will be 
passed out this week. Applications 
for the Snow Sculpture, the Win- 
ter Olympics, and the queen can- 
didate will be in the mailboxes 
at the end of this week. These 
applications should be returned 
before Christmas vacation. There 
will be three trophies for the Snow 
Sculpture, two overall trophies for 
the Winter Olympics, and one 
trophy for the sled race. There 
will also be ribbons. Flowers have 
been ordered for the queen, who 
will also receive fifty dollars to 
be split evenly between the queen 
and the organization sponsoring 
her. The judging of the Snow 
Sculpture and the Winter Olym- 
pics will be held at the same time. 
One member of each organization 
participating in the Snow Sculp- 
ture must be present at the judg- 
ing. Invitations for the Snow 
Bound Party (the donee to be held 
during Winter Carnival) arc being 
considered. No band has as yet 
been scheduled for the Carnival 
Dance to be held Saturday night 
February 7 during Penny Carni- 

Thc president of the SUB con- 
tacted Dean Manges about clean- 
up after the Dean's Ball. He is to 
find out is cleanup can be post- 
poned until Sunday morning after 
the dance. The stamp with the 
dale change to be stamped on the 
envelope of the invitations for 
the Dean's Ball should be here 
next week. 

The Students for a Free Society 
requested the use of the studeot

December 7. The dance is to start 
at two in the afternoon. Their re- 
quest was accepted unanimously.

Legalize Pot?

As I sit here on my bed with 
the Hondrix album going full

memory. 

"Have you tried pot?" 

"What?" 

"Have you smoked pot?" 

"No . . . you?" 

"Yeh, cverylime you see me I'm 

"No. You're kidding." 

I wish he had been. Pot isn't 
bad. A person does not become 
addicted to it. There are no after 
effects. You cannot lost your mind 
by taking it. It is just a beauti- 
ful escape from troubles — like par- 
ent pressure to get better grades, 
the cost of living going up, or the 
loss of a job — difficulties like that. 

Pot is a lot better than some 
other drugs I can think of. A 
friend of mine took some acid one 
time and blew his mind pcrman- 
.Tilly. He took five tabs at once — 
he wasn't even conscious of 
high. Another friend was hung up 
on Speed — he mode a visit lo

Chavis Loves Travel, Kids 



Mr. William Chavis, Coordina- 
tor of Financial Aid and Place- 
ment, is a very busy man. Al- 
though he has many outside in- 
terests such as golf and photogra- 
phy, his real love is travel. He 
has seen almost every area of the 
United States, and hopes to visit 
St. Crois, San Francisco, and Cape 
Cod in the near future. Says 
Chavis, "I don't know why. I just 
have a thing about these places." 

New York and Philadelphia are 
his two favorite cilies because 
"they're exciting — they swing!" 
Willi many friends and relatives 
in New York, Mr. Chavis finds 
many opportunities to enjoy 
"night life and party people." 

Comparing New York to Fort 
Wayne, Mr. Chavis remarked that 
there are many more things lo do 
in New York. One can see Broad- 
way plays, stroll through Central 
Park ("which really isn't dan- 
gerous if you don't look like a 
tourist") and watch ocean liners 



itself is not bad. It is not ad- 
dictive. My friends started on pot. 
They went on to higher drugs be- 
cause they wanted a better "high." 
Some people can smoke pot and 
not desire a better high, so they 
do not experiment any further. 
Some people experiment with 
stronger drugs and they figure 
that things will he safe. Maybe 
they will be, but why spend so 
much money to achieve a high 
that nature will give you for 
free? Don't you realize that when 
you become conscious of your 
problems again they will seem 
bigger than before? Think on 
these things if after smoking pot 
you want a better high.

which to bring up 
his three sons. In Fort Wayne, 
Mr. Chavis senses a real commu- 
nity spirit and lock of an ever- 
present delinquency problem. 

With a YMCA group, Mr. Cha- 
vis made a study of big city street 
gangs. The purpose of this pro- 
ject was to explore the inner work- 
ings of a gang, and to understand 
the gang spirit of camaraderie. 
For three days and nights, Mr. 
Chavis worked around Chicago's 
West Side with a Puerto Rican 
gang leader, talking with many 
young gang members. 

"AH thes kids have similar 
problems," states Mr. Chavis, 
''They're lonely, bored and broke. 
Ninety per cent of the lime there 
is nothing to do." Mr. Chavis 
comments that with a group of 
boys aged 14-17, who have vivid 
Imaginations and nothing to do, 
it's easy to see how a gang de- 
velops. Often, there is the "dare" 
element. Dores will be challenged 
merely to light boredom. 'The 
young hoys resent authority he- 
cause they've never had to respect 
it before. There is a definite lone- 
liness, a definite lack of love." 

A native of oFrt Wayne, Mr. 
Chavis graduated from South Side 
High School. He attended Ball 
Slate to earn a B.A. in biology. 
His M.A. in psychology and coun- 
seling was from St. Francis Col-

Boiler-Hoosier| Victory 
Lost In Final Minutes 



Hey! Hey! They got that ball 
and fought. Before the game, the 
time clock wasn't working. At the 
game's start. Curly Haas's Sal- 
ons damped a puzzle on the floor 
which took its toll of LU.-P.U. 

The Boilermaking Hoosiers 
fought on even terms with the 
Saxons for the first ten minutes, 
down only 18-12. Then Concor- 
dia's zone press got sticky, causing 
turnovers. The Saxon's spider web 
got them the ball and enabled 
them to build up a 44-19 half 
time lead. India na-Purdue had 
been outscored 21-4 the final 
ten minutes. 

•' Getting assignments straight- 
ened out at half time. Coach Alt- 
man's team bounced back, cutting 
a 35 point deficit to 19. Ross 
Gick lead the surge with a game 
high 19 points. Jahnekc, the Sax- 
on's leading scorer finished with 
14, being held to only 5 the second 
half. 

Dropping their fourth game of 
the season Indiana-Purdue bit the 
floor Saturday night looking for 
a 3rd place finish in the tourney. 

For two minutes both teams 
were in a scoreless tie, then the 
Boiler-Hoosiers drew blood on a 
layup. Soon they had blitzed the 
Troubadours, expanding the lead 
to a 15-8 bulge. St. Francis caught 
fire going out front 17-16, and 
walked to a 30-25 half time td- 
vantage. 

St. Francis was still on fire in 
the second half, pulling away 
49-36. Then ndiana-Purdue's Ross

Slow Start Has It's Reasons 



by Darrell Parnin 
It all began several weeks be- 
fore the basketball season opened. 
A tape recorded from the campus 
hierarchy had just been received. 
ft was the usual kind of message 
you'd expect from the CIA. 

It went something like this: 
"Your mission should you decide 
to accept it, Coach Airman, is to 
have a winning basketball season. 
Of course you know if you or any 
member of the team is caught 
losing, this office will deny any

accepted a suicide mission. Per-

partment this college offers a

does this regional campus have?

conducting shooting practice with 
apple baskets, you're not for off. 

Here's a roll call of what this 
college doesn't have: statisticians 
to keep robound, turnover, steals, 
and field shot records; team man- 
agers; personel for effective scout- 
ing; and no possibility of having 
game films. To a coach it's like 
trying to tell time with the minute 



hand missing. It's like giving 
crazy wheels to a drivjr and ex- 
pecting him to win the Indy 500 

Don't get me wrong, this col- 
lege has done one thing in its 
favor. They've set up a trust fund 
to buy Gatoraide for the next five 
years. 

What kind of a coach would 
work under these circumstances? 
One who has eyes that see beyond 
the present, on with eyes that see 
the future and ask why not, that's 
who. He's a man who has the 
respect of every player on the

A young team losea games, but 
a young team has a way of grow- 
ing up. And quite a bit of that 
was done at the Indiana Tech 
Tourney. In losing to St. Francis, 
they felt loss as a team for the 
first time. Victory was only a 
couple of buckets away that night, 
but its taste was in their mouth 
and it hurt. And so the age of 
acruarius might be soon for them. 

So if you're at a home game 
this season and you hear. a guy 
say, "Airman, how come no win- 
ning record?" Do me a favor: 
Belt him in the mouth! 

And that's the way it is, this 
sports week in 1969.
