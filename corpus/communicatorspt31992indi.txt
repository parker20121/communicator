Traffic problems no worse than expected 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

The first few weeks of school 
will always cause problems but 
Police Chief Lauren DenHariog 
said he eupccied worse. 

Increased enrollment and 
uncompleted construction, 
explained DenHariog, are the 
main reasons there is a lack of 
parking and traffic congestion. 

"In a few weeks the number of 
cars coming into the campus will 
drop off. Right now we have 
peak limes where 3,000 to 3,500 
cars arc on campus at a lime." 
said Hariog, 

Wilh lliai many cars moving 



around campus simultaneously, 
DenHariog said minor problems 
are expected. 

In ihe firsl week of school about 
six car accidents were reported, 
DenHanog noied. 

Senior Jason Sprungcr said. 
"The traffic sucks on this campus. 
It is loo crowded and you can'i 
gel on campus, then you can't gel 
off." 

Don Kaiier, physical plant direc- 
tor, explained, "Parking is always 
a bear at the beginning of the 
semester. But I can't really do 
anything except worry about it 
like everybody else." 

According to DenHariog, iraHlc 



problems will be alleviated when 
the new entrance is linishcd. 

"We don't know whai routes 
people will take, but wc hope ihcy 
use 37." added DenHariog. 

In addition to tragic back-ups. 
students have been complaining 
about the usual unavailibilly of 
parking spaces. 

Conlribuling to ihc parking 
problem, spaces were eliminated 
and some B parking was convert- 
ed to A. As a result, many A 
spaces arc left unused. 

"Wc don't know how much is 
being utilized yet," said 
DenHariog. He added if too 
much of the A parking is not used,

Helmke Library to receive 
new computer capabilities 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

Helmke Library's move into 
the information age is making 
sources easier to find for students 
and faculty at IPFW. 

According to Judy Violetie, 
assistant director of the library, 
Helmke has added several new 
computer access features and 
will be aaamg more intormation 
technologies this fall, 

Violciie said the library has 
expanded its line of specialized 
indexes to include education, 
psychology and business 
sources. More indexes are soon 
to be added, as well as new on- 
line source listings, 

VioIctic noted that access to 
Helmkc's on-line features has 
been made easier now that new 
computer terminals have been 
added in the library. 

"Wc arc seeing an enormous 
jump in what information we 
have to otfer. And this is just die 
first phase in the project," 
Violeitc said. "There will be two 
or Uirec limes die number of data 
bases and access points available 
in just this year. And this is just 
Uic start" 

Violetie also noted that the 
library will be using compact 
disc technology lo set up a sys- 
tem to hook up all personal com- 
puters on campus to Hclmke's 
data sysiem. Soon, students and 
faculty will be able to access the 
library's on-line features from 
any PC on campus. Violetie said. 

Another advanuge made avail- 
able by the new technologies 
coming soon to the library is a 
greater access lo sources in col- 
lege and public libraries across 
the nation and the world, 

Violeitc said a new feature 
coming this winter will allow 



students to order source material 
by just entering their student 
identification number, "With this 
feature students will be able to 
order ihings from other hbraries 
without moving from ihe com- 
puter terminal," 

Violetie said die cunent on-line 
catalog can be accessed night or 
day from home, if the student 
Has a computer with a modem. 
"You could l&gt;e silling at home at - 
midnight and search ID 
{Information Online) for sources. 
If doesn't mailer if the library is 
open or closed." Violeue said. 

The only downside to the tech- 
nological advancemenis made in 
the library, according to Violeue, 
is finding space to put the new 
computer equipment, 

"We arc quickly approaching 
the crisis stage with space in the 
library, Wc arc worried about 



how we are going to provide 
sealing, as well as make room 
for more computer clusters," 
Violetie said, 

"The space pnablem is one we 
are addressing now. But even if 
we had the money to put on an, 
addition lo ihe library it would 
be a long limc until anything was 
done," Violeitc added. 

But she said the positive 
aspects of adding ihc new com- 
puter lechnologies far overshad- 
ow the space situation, 

"I find this all extremely excit- 
ing," Violctte said. "What it boils 
down to is a great increase in 
access to many more data bases 
and many more access points on 
campus." 

If everything happens as 
planned, Violeitc noted, the new 
systems will be hooked up and 
ready to go by mid-Oclober. 






It will beswiichedback 10 B, 

Also B permit holders arc 
rcsiricied from meter parking, and 
DenHariog said ihcy will be 
checking license plate numbers. 
He stressed that it is important 
thai visitors have access to 
parking. 

Although there have been many 
complaints about parking. 
DenHariog said the number of 
parking tickets issued has been 
minimal. He estimated that the 
rate increases may be a deterrent. 
DenHanog added that the police 
deparimenl expects the trend to 
continue, but said, "That will be 
determined by the parkcrs, not the 



dcpaiuncni. ' 

The majority of tickets, accord- 
ing 10 DenHariog. have been for 
parking in fire lanes and on the 
grass. 

As an altcmaiivc lo complaining 
about Ihe parking and traffic prob- 
lems, DenHanog offered some 
advice. 

"The closest lots always fill up 
first, which are the lots on ihe 
south side. The loLs by die athlet- 
ic center and fine arts building 
have noi filled up yet, so parking 
is always available there. 

"h's a six minute walk from the 
fine arts building to Keiller Hall," 
said DenHanog. 



Athletic Center 
offers students 
great workout 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

The IPFW Athletic Center has 

seen a lot of business since ihc 
fall scmcsier slaried, according 
10 Aamir Siddiqui, a supervisor 
at the center. 

'The first weeks are always the 
busiest because Ihc students 
don't have that much studying to 
do." said Siddiqui. 

Use of the Athletic Center is 
free to students with a valid uni- 
versity services card. 

For a general workout, the cen- 
ter offers a weight area which 
includes a complete Nautilus 
sysiem. free weights, four stair- 
masters and a tread mill. 

There is a thirty minute lime 
limit on the siairmasiers and a 
forty-five minute limit on the 
tread mill, according to the 
weight area supervisor. 

Al Stevens, an IPFW student 
using the Nauiilus equipment 
^id he appreciated die center. 

"It's a good facility, and it's 
convenient for me. 1 fikc to come 
before class and get a good 
workout." said Stevens, 

In addition to the weight area, 
the center offers three basketball 
courts, a wallyball court, four 
racketball courts and a track. 

Students wishing to use the 
facilities need to check in at the 
red desk in the basement of die 
center, said Siddiqui, 

"If the student is unfamiliar 
with the center, we will give 
them a tour and explain the pro- 
cedures to diem," said Siddiqui, 



Starting in September, the cen- 
ter will hold aerobics classes. 

Sludenls can sign up for ihe 
classes through the continuing 
education department, located in 
Walb Memorial Union, 

Sharon Tsignloff leaches ihe 
classes. She said she was very 
impressed widi die facilidcs. 

"It's one of the best places in 
Fort Wayne to work out. They 
have the most room. It's a nice 
atmosphere, and all the people 
who work here are really helpful 
and friendly," said Tsignloff, 

Tsignloff is also a second grade- 
leachcr for Fort Wayne 
Community Schools. 

"I like leaching aerobics here at 
IPFW. I've always been involved 
in aerobics because it's so 
healthy, and I'd like to encourage 
odicrs to make health and fitness 
a way of life," said Tsignloff, 

For students who appreciate a 
real workout, the center offers a 
locker and shower room. The 
first section of die locker room is 
for general students. There arc 
separdie sections for sports team 
members and faculty, according 
to Siddiqui, 

"The lockers are good for stu- 
dents because athledc wear must 
be worn in the center, and it 
gives them a place to shower and 
change," said Siddiqui. 

Siddiqui also noted that the 
center recently received a new 
shipment of athledc equipment, 
so most of the rackets and balls 
are new. 



Campus police 
concerned about 
improper parking 



By Mike Wade 
Managing Editor 

IPFW police have kept busy 
the past two weeks writing 
warning tickets and dealing 
with minor incidents, but no 
major problems have come up 
so far, according to sergeant 
Ron Motz. 

"We had a lot of nickel and 
dime stuff to deal with but 
nothing of consequence," said 
Mou. 

The police reported a couple 
of minor traffic accidents, a lol 
of problems wiih people lock- 
ing their keys in their cars, and 
argument over a garage door 
opener and the dicft of a fire 
extinguisher. 

"The fire extinguisher theft 
amazes mc. It happens occa- 
sionally. It's like stealing 
somebody's old underwear; I 
don't see die value of il." said 
Mou. 

Police officer Dave Reinhold 
said they were still having a 
problem with permit holders 
parking in the metered spaces. 

"It's still a big problem. We 
haven't been writing tickets, 
but we've written a lol of 
warnings," said Reinhold. 

The police will continue to 
write warnings for about 
another week, but then they'll 
Stan writing tickets, said Motz. 

"They'll get tickets even if 



there's money in the meter. It's 
a ten dollar fine which doesn't 
mean just skipping the Big 
Mac, It means skipping 
McDonald's all togedier." said 
Moiz. 

Motz warned students not lo 
think they'll be able to park in 
die metered spots if they don't 
display their permiL 




"You get to recognize the 
cars. If a blue Poniiac is parked 
in front of Kettler every 
Monday. Wednesday and 
Friday at about six. it doesn't 
lake a brain surgeon to figure 
out they're in class," Said 
Moiz. 

"We'll run spot checks on the 
vehicles, regardless of whether 
or not there's a permit hang- 
ing," said Motz.

IPFW cafeteria 
rips off students 



Inflation has become a way of 
life at IPFW. And even though 
we've come to expect dramatic 
increases in textbook and tuition 
costs, it was surprising to have 
the hammer fall so close to 
home. 

The Fort cafeteria in Walb 
raised its prices this year. 

Students can still get a meal 
for a few dollars, but is it a 
value in these hard economic 
times? 

At Wal-Mart, you can buy a 
cold can of pop for 35 cents. At 
IPFW. courtesy of the Canteen, 
pop costs 60 cents for a can or 
60 cents for a 16 ounce cup in 
the Fort snack machine area. 

Pop costs 75 cents, for what is 
passed off as a large, in the Fort 
cafeteria area. 

At most fast food restaurants, 
free pop refills are offered. 
Maybe the Fort should follow 
Taco Bell's lead and make a run 
for the border. 

Often the Fort is poorly 
stocked with even simple things 
like straws. Perhaps we should 
all remember to supply our own. 
Because, last week, no straws 
could be found. 

Feeling fruity? You can pur- 
chase an apple for 60 cents in 
the Fort. It'll be a nice apple 



and, polished properly, make a 
nice accent to any professor's 
desk. But that's quite a profit 
margin. 

But the Fort can do it. After 
all, they have a monopoly on 
this campus. Even campus 
organizations have a tough time 
selling food here. So if you want 
to hold a bake sale or some- 
thing, cross your fingers. 

Many students are here at 
IPFW because they don't have 
cash to toss around like some 
"major university" students 
might have. 

We deserve a better deal! 

Most students have about an 
hour and a half or less for lunch. 
During the lunch rush there is 
little time to go off campus for 
food. So we are stuck with cold 
cheeseburgers and hmp fries for 
the price of something that 
should be bigger and better. 

Now is the time to do some- 
thing about this situation. Join 
together all to show we are not 
satisfied with what our monop- 
oly meal provider is offering. 

What can we do? Three 
words: brown bag it! Join us in 
protesting this affront to capital- 
ism by taking part Friday in 
IPFW sack lunch day. 

We'll bring the apples.

Being a freshman can be tough 



By Dave Boggess 
llluslralor 

Well, We've finally made iL 
we're college freshmen! 

Throughout the summer 
most of us probably blocked 
out any thoughts of school or 
learning. 

His view 

Then that big day struck. 
Again we were thrust back 
into school, except now we 
had the dreaded task of being 
freshmen all over again. 

Usually the freshmen year, 
in any selling, is one we look 
back at and laugh about. Bui 
going through it isn't very 
funny. 



What does being a freshman 
in college mean? For starters. 
it means searching for build- 
ings that are blocks apart. 
Even if you are lucky enough 
to find Ihe building, the next 
task is 10 find the room 
you're suppose lobe in. This 
task doesn't sound difTicull 
to you veterans around 
campus, but I'm sure thai 
even you can admit moments 
of confusion. 

The next challenge to over- 
come is finding a parking 
spot and getting to class on 
lime. 1 can remember starting 
out from home at 9:45 to 
catch a 10:30 class, only lo be 
lost in u^Hc unUl 11:00, 

Sure I could find my way 
here, but I never expected lo 



have lo circle the campus five 
times before 1 actually 
parked. 

From my experience here so 
far, I've learned three very 
important rules. 

Number one: When you 
have a mid-morning class, 
never leave any later ihan one 
hour before it starts, if you 
hope to gel a reawnably close 
parking spoL 

Number two: If for some 
reason you should leave later 
than that, head for ihe Fine 
Arts Building parking lot. 

Number three: If every 
parking space seems to be 
filled, never go into the park- 
ing garage. You'll cmly waste 
anoiiienen minutes. 

If you keep these things 



in mind, you should be able 
to avoid some of the 
headaches I'm sure we've all 
experienced. 

In order to find your classes 
more easily, I've found that 
having some kind of map of 
Ihe campus is very helpful. If 
you need lo get yourself back 
on [rack, after wandering for 
five minutes, look forHelmke 
Library which is located 
about in the cenlcr of cam- 
pus. 

If you've made it through 
the first week, remember thai 
ihc toughest part is over. The 
only challenges you'll be- 
faced with now are: home- 
work, grades, and gelling a 
new class schedule figured 
out for the second semester! 



Quayle could be the next Nixon

serious and noi-so-serious 
issues. Your responses arc 
half the fun. Letlers to the

Commentary 

First topic: Abortion, 

What other topic consumes 
so many while accomplishmg 
so little? As Jack Kemp elo- 
quently stated, "Personal 
freedom increased in every 
part of the world." during the 
Bush presidency. 

Every part of ihc world 
except the United Slates of 
America. Freedom of 
Choice? Reproductive rights? 
Not while Pat Robertson and 
Jerry Falwell and Marilyn 
Quayle control the White 
House. 

Maldng abortion illegal will 
not stop abortion. Bombing 
clinics wilt not slop it. 
Verbally and physically 
assaulting potential abortion- 
ers will not slop it. 

It is a problem very similar 
to ihe War on Drugs. As long 
as there is a demand there 



will be a supply. As long as 
there are uninicnded pregnan- 
cies there will be abortions. 

If your goal is to save the 
innocent lives of the unborn 
fetuses of America you are 
taking ihe wrong route by 
joining Operation Rescue and 
fundamentally demeaning 
yourself and your stance in 
front of the national media. 

Slop uninicnded pregnan- 
cies. 

Stop rape and incest. 
Contraception and education 
arc the keys lo change in this 
arena. 

Abortion is not a religious 
issue. It is a social issue, an 
issue of economics and an 
issue of education. 

Education is ihe force 
behind all true and lasting 
change. Education can stop 
rape. Education can leach 
contraception. Education can 
Slop incest. 

If your goal is to persecute 
and alienate and control the 
American Woman continue 
down your surly path with 
Robertson and Falwell and 
company. 
Topic II: The Q Factor 

As Ihc GOP approached iis 
convention in Houston 
rumors encircled the presi- 
dential ticket, Vice-President 
Dan Quayle was considered a 
liability to the ticket and was 
on ihe brink of being 
replaced. 
Perhaps Quayle should 



replace Bush. Bush's appear- 
ance ai die convention, play- 
ing Ihc role as ihe sniping, 
venomous incumbent, was an 
affront lo those moderates 
who elected him in 1988 and 
Reagan twice before him. 

Quayle, who is generally 
famed for his slips of the 
tongue (the next election is in 
four years and not in 1994. 
Dan), redeemed himself nice- 
ly at the podium on the cul- 
minating Thursday night of 
the convention. He is the 
whipping boy of the media, 
today. 

So was Richard Nixon thirty 
or so years ago. Rumored 
improprieties (see the 
"Checkers" speech) and a 
pasty debate in 1960 with 
Kennedy made him the whip- 
ping boy of the Republican 
Pany, If my history is correct, 
he was heard from again, and. 
in fact, was elected President 
in 1968. 

Dan Quayle, Indiana's 
native son. is too bright not to 
see this historical precedent. 
He will be back, it is only a 
question of when. 
Short Takes 

Is it unconstitutional for ihe 
Congress lo have a President 
euthanized? Bush's attacks at 
the demo-controlled House 
and Senate may have them 
checking for a humane 

option Have I gotten under 

your skin yet? I absolutely 
love gelling mail (please no 



lellcr-bombs, or chain Id- 
lers), Just address your con- 
cerns to the address for the 
paper, and send it lo my 
aiieniion, or drop it by the 
Communicalor Office Walb 
Memorial Union Room 

215 Perhaps if rapper and 

now hcavy-meialist Ice-T 
really wanted to show sup- 
port for his cause he could 
establish the Cop Killers 
Legal Defense Fund with the 
profits from his Body Count 
Album Perhaps the quick- 
est way to eliminate the 
national debt would be lo 
merely default on all the 
loans. It would be very hard 
for any of these lender 
nations lo actually come and 
repossess us, wouldn't 

it? Are the King verdict 

riots the cause of the Dodger 
collapse in baseball? Between 
Lasorda's losers and ihe hap- 
less Angels of Anaheim. Los 
Angeles is the black hole of

lice in America? How do you 
explain Uiai the King-Beaters 
of L,A. and Ross Perot walk 
the streets while Mike Tyson 
(evidence suppressed) and 
John Colli (honest business- 
man) rot in prison? Fairness

THE COMMUNICATOR 



TTiutsday, Scpicmbcr ?, 1992 



New columnist guy recalls childhood toys of death 



"The Empire Strikes Back" 
was on T.V. last week. It 
brought back oodles of mem- 
ories. I used to be one of the 
biggest Star Wars fans. 
According to my memory, I 
saw every one of the Star 
Wars movies at least a dozen 
times (If you refer to the 
handy memory- to-real ity 
adjustment scale, you'll see 
that that means I actually saw 
each Star Wars movie about 3 
times). But I did memorize 
every line from those movies 
(I memorized 4 lines from 
each movie). I had all (25%) 
of the Star Wars toys. I would 
spend hours at a time in a 
captivated bliss playing 
with my Star Wars toys 
(Hours, yes, but three- 
fourths of those hours were 
spent getting everything out 
and putting everything back). 
Ah, those wonderful child- 
hood memories. 

So I went to my mom's 
house yesterday and crawled 
up into the atiic, looking for 
the box labeled "Tim's Star 
Wars Toys." I staggered 
down the attic ladder with a 
box that could have been a 
comfortable home to a small 
tribe in South America. I was 
bursting with anticipation of 
returning to my childhood for 
a few hours. Or maybe 1 was 
just bursting from a hernia. 

Of course my Star Wars toys 
weren't the only things in the 
box. I also found my G.I. Joe 
toys, my Baitlestar Galaclica 
toys, and some really neat 
robot-type things that come

apart and become other things 
(one leg, for instance, was a 
gun that shot those suction 
cup arrows - you know, the 
ones that are so much fun to 
shoot at the T.V. because they 
stick to the screen). 
When I think of all the vio- 
lent toys I had as a child 
(laserbeams, death rays, 
armed spaceships, torture 
devices that sucked out peo- 
ple's brains through their eye- 
balls) it's a wonder thai I 
didn't turn out to be a serial 
killer. Maybe I got all the 
death out of my system at an 
early age. Maybe people who 

Just a Theory 

by Tim Schreiber 

are obsessed with war are 
overcompensating because 
their parents didn't buy them 
enough toys with brain-suck- 
ing capability. Who knows? 
It's just a theory. 

I remember the toy indus- 
try's mantra. Three words that 
are heard more on Saturday 
morning T.V. than the sound 
of an animal being squished. 
Any toy consumer will recog- 
nize these wonis. The words, 
no doubt, will indmidate any 
father who doesn't have engi- 
neering in his blood. Luckily, 



I did have engineering in my 
blood, so the words never 
bothered me. I was fairly 
bright and the words just 
added to my excitement. It 
was something to make my 
fun more of a challenge. 
Those three words are: Some 
Assembly Required. 

It's funny, but those are the 
exact words that first struck 
me when I opened a box of 
toys. I found thousands, pos- 
sibly billions, of little parts 
lying among big parts. Space 
ships missing wings. Robots 
missing heads. Those motor- 
cycle-like-things missing 
those little thingamajigs that 
snap on top of the 
whatchamacallit, to make it 
spin faster. 

I started sorting everything 
out. I'd pick up a toy, say "1 
remember this!" and admire it 
for a bit, put it on the floor, 
and dive back into the box. 
Soon 1 had piles of toys lying 
semi-sorted on the floor, all 
waiting for accompaning parts 
lying in the bottom of the box. 
I had resurrected the bedroom 
of my childhood! I half 
expected my mom to walk 
into the room and say, "Clean 
up this mess! It looks like a 
tornado went through here!" 

For some reason I had 
remembered my toys being in 
better shape than they were. 1 



had forgotten about my B.B. 
gun. and its affects on my Star 
Wars collection. I had forgot- 
ten about the missing limbs 
that 1 had sawed off to make 
my figures more like the char- 
acters in the movies. I had 
forgotten the high percentage 
of my Star Wars people who 
were missing their heads. I 
had forgotten about whole 
chunks of spaceships being 
held together with tape. I had 
forgotten some sticky and red- 
dish substance (probably 
Kool-aid) that covered many 
of my people. I had forgotten 
the batteries left in one of the 
toys, which were corroded. 

I had forgotten about my 
Lego set. They were all safely 
sealed together in an old 
lunch box. I love Legos. They 
appealed to the artist in me. I 
took the lunch box and 
dumped it out on the kitchen 
table. And I played with my 
Legos. 

After my architectural 
artistry was all tapped out, I 
put the Leeos back in the 
lunch box and decided I 
would take them home. I am 
much too mature to play with 
spaceships and space people 
and headless robots and laser- 
beams, but. hey... Legos are 
an intellectual outlet and 
wholly appropriate for a 
mature and well-adjusted

IPFW professor says

By Mary Shrock Next, Kalamaras studied in Albany, 

Features Edilor New York at the Stale University of 

As both a teacher of English and New York, where he earned his 



associate director of the writing pro- 
gram, IPFW assistant professor 
George Kalamaras keeps very busy. 

But he is always sure lo make 
time for his favorite pastime ■ 
writing. 

"Writing has given mc so much. It 
changed my life, and my leaching is 
a way to keep the gift moving." 
Kabmar4is said. 

Kalamaras originally majored in 
business and English at Indiana 
University, Bloom inglon. 

"I never thought of making a living 
at writing," Kalamaras said, '"I feel 
like I found my niche in research 
writing." 

When Kalamaras first visited 
IPFW he said he was impressed with 
the English department's writing 
program. 

"1 think the English department 
here is really wonderful," Kalamaras 
said.

It was during his time as a gradu-

Kalamaras first tasted the joys of 
being a teacher.

"I would really miss not teaching 
students. 1 get 5o much energy 
teaching; it would be a weird feel- 
ing, not working with students," he 
said. 

Kalamaras has also travelled. 

He has lived in such places as Fon

Kalamaras to IPFW was the English 
department's philosophy of 
"process-writing", a concept which 
was introduced to Kalamaras at 
Colorado State. 

Process-writing is the idea that stu- 
denLs write from their own aims and 
purposes to discover their own 
thinking in more depth. 

Journals of daily topics are pan of 
the process-writing philosophy as 
well as writing across the curriculum 



^hich sucsses the importance of 
writing in disciplines other than 
English; such as biology which 
Kalamaras did at State University at 
Albany. 

Kalamaras published two books of 
poetry: "Heart Without End", 
"Beneath die Breath" and has writ- 
ten "In the Tree of the Holding 
Sound", during his tenure at IPFW. 

Nature was the focus of much of 
Kalamaras' earlier poetry. 

"I had come from Indiana to 
Colorado. It just changed my whole 
life being in this new landscape. It 
bowled mc over," Kalamaras said. 

"Right now I'm involved in the 
techniques of surrealist poetry, 
which is a poeuy that tries lo blur 
the boundaries between waking real- 
ity and dreams," said Kalamaras. 

Recently Kalamaras was published 
in a national anthology along side 
such poets as Robert BIy and Allen 
Ginsberg. 

Currently Kalamaras commutes 
between his work in Fort Wayne and 
his home in Wanaw. 

His wife, Mary Ann Cain, shares 
Kalamaras' interest in writing and is 
the director of writing at (he Indiana 
University extension in South Bend. 

Kalamaras said his plans for die 
future will be lo continue his work 
at IPFW. 

He has another book being pub- 
lished and is working on gcuing his 
latest volume of poetry published. 

"The students haven't let me 
down. 1 see my future here," 
Kalamaras said.

Greg Callen, student activities 
director, said, "They are alternative 
movies, in that, they arc not block- 
buster films. The movies are cho- 
sen based on issue and for 
expanding our students' cultural 
awareness." 

Beginning Sept. 17, "Building 



Bombs" and "Deadly Deception" 
will be featured. Two animated 
shons will be shown: "Nukic Takes 
a Valium" and "Manic Denial," 

"Building Bombs" deals with the 
moral and political issues of 
nuclear waste and the impact toxic 
waste has on one American 
community, 

"Deadly I&gt;eception" exposes the 
dirt on GE's nuclear weapon's busi- 
ness and shows that it may not 
always "bring good things to life." 

On Sept. 17, "Cover Up" tells 
many of the most shocking and 
imporiant details of the Iran/Conira 
affair. 

Kamran Rao. the president of stu- 
dent activities, said, 'The allcma- 
live movies arc a new thing we're 
trying ouL Oneof the aiiraeiions of 
our campus is that the students arc 
27 and older, so hopefully they'll 
come to sec the alternative films. If 
it goes well we'll keep doing ii, if 
not we'll do something else,"

THE COMMUNICATOR 



ThurNiJay, Scptombor 3, 1992 



Lady Volley-Dons set to start season 



iiv.]i)V Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Lisa Shcchan, coach of the IPFW 
women's volleyball team, has wit- 
nessed the iransformalion of the 
program from club-sport atmos- 
phere 10 a compeiilive, organized 
NCAA Division II squad. 

From Shcchan's playing days in 
the early 80s under then head coach 
Amie Ball, to her stint as assistant 
coach, again under ihc lulclage of 
Ball, and Tinally as head coach in 
which she guided last season's team 
to a first place tic in the GLVC 
standings and a second place finish 
in Ihc GLVC tournament, the 
women's volleyball program has 
exponentially improved. 

Wlh narrowly missing a bid to the 
NCAA loumcy by losing lo Ashland 
in the final match of the GLVC tour- 
ney in 1991, Shcchan may face one 
of her most difficult tasks in her 
eleven years with the women's vol- 
leyball program in improving upon 
last season's success. 

The difficulty, according to 
Shcchan, will be the team's inexpe- 
rience, "Wc arc a very, very young 
team," Shcchan said. 

The Lady "Dons return only six 
players, of which only two started. 
The bulk of the team is represented 
by Freshmen. 

Only Junior Jill Lyon, an all-con- 
ference seller, along with senior 
Julie Huticr, who lines up as an out- 
side hiiler, siarlcd tor last season's 
23-12 Lady "Dons. 

Joy Thayer, an ouiside hiiter in her 
junior season, is well accustomed 
with [he IPFW offense and is 
expected lo step into a starling, lead- 
ership role. 

"Between Jill, Joy and Julie they 
will give ihc leadership lo the others 
that ihcy need," Shcchan said- 
Amy Pocivado, a transfer student 
from Ihc University of Texas-San 
Anionio, also brings some experi- 
ence 10 the Lady "Dons. Peolvado 
saw action in the NCAA tourney 
last season as a middle hiiter, a posi- 
tion IPFW is very inexperienced at. 

"The middle is one of our weak 
spots because of inexperience," 
Shcchan said. 

Although Shcchan has an arduous 
task improving on last year's squad. 



last year's squad also made it easier. 
With successful teams, bctier play- 
ers arc drawn to these programs. 
'The recruiting hasn't been easier. 
but since IPFW is in ihe spoiiighl. in 
all spons. players come lo us. The 
top aihlcte's are looking at IPFW as 
a first choice," Shcchan said. 

The success of the men's volley- 
ball program has helped Shcchan's 
rccniiling job more than any other 
sport, and yei no competitiveness is 
fell towards ihe Vollcydons. "Every 
time they are in the news, it is good 
for us, very good." Shcehan said. 

One of these lop athletes thai 
chose IPFW is Heather Teagarden 
from Snider High School. 
Teagarden was an ouiside right-side 
hitler for last season's siaie champi- 
onship Panthers of Snider 

"I wasn't surprised lo gel Heather, 
bul I went afier her very strongly, 
Snider's volleyball program gives a 
good background and diey run an 
offense like ours," Shcchan said. 

The biggest transition Teagarden 
feels she will have from high school 
volleyball to ihc collegiate level is 
the number of games played in each 
match. "In high school you play 
three games and in college ii is five. 
I played club volleyball and worked 
volleyball camps during the sum- 
mer, so I feel I am in pretty good 
condition." Teagarden said. 

Amy Reidcnbach. a freshman from 
West Noble High School, joins 
Teagarden as a member of die fresh- 
man recruiting class. Reidcnbach 
plays middle htuer, one of the most 
difficult positions in volleyball to 
master. "Middle requires a lot of 
training," Shcchan said. 

Sheehan would also like to try 
April Baer as middle hiiter. Bacr sat 
out last season for the Lady "Dons 
because of an injury, 

Andre Woodcock and Shannon 
Smith should also expect to see 
action as hitters. Woodcock, a fresh- 
man middle hitler, and Smith, an 
ouiside hitler rcdshiried last season, 
will need more fine-tuning to com- 
pete in the NCAA at levels ihey arc 
capable of. "1 expect Andre and 
Shannon lo contribute. Alhledcally 
they are lough, but they need a little 
more knowledge." Shcchan said. 

Rounding out the young team are 



the defensive specialists. Lisa 
Hendricks, Calhy Gulp and Cadiy 
Cook also belong lo ihc freshman 
recruiting class. Joming the young 
freshmen in the defense will be 
junior Carol LaMan. 'These are my 
'Defensive Demons.' They play ihe 
ball within a 20 fool radius." 
Shcchan said. 

Besides a strong recruiting class. 
[he Lady 'Dons also have as an asset 
good scheduling. Last season IPFW 
had only three maiches compared lo 
13 scheduled for this season. "A 23- 
12 record's a great uccomplishmeni 
when you consider we only had 
diree home dates," Sheehan said. 

The Lady 'Dons begin the season 
over ihe Labor Day weekend in a 
six [cam loumameni at Grand Valley 
Stale. Joining IPFW and Grand 
Valley State is Oakland College 
from DeiToil, Lake Superior Slate. 
Ihe University of Wisconsin- 
Parkside, and the University of 
Alaska-Fairbanks. 

The first home match is Scpi.ll 
and 12 in the IPFW/ Mark Fore 
Invitational. Lewis, Ashland. Grand 
Valley Slate and Gannon University 
will be in Fon Wayne for ihe iwo- 
day tournament. 

With such a young squad the 
future looks very bright for ihe Lady 
'Dons and head coach Lisa 
Sheehan. "The fuiure does look very 
bright for us, bul I am looking at 
this season's future. Wiih five 
matches in two games ai Grand 
Valley, we will be gelling a ion of 
experience very early." Sheehan 
said.
