It's the beginning of a new semester . . . This time you're 
going to do it right. This time it's a 4.0, or maybe a 3.5. This time 
you'll keep up with the readings. 

And the way to keep up is to buy your own textbooks. 
They're always there when you need them, not just when a 
friend or the library can loan them to you.
