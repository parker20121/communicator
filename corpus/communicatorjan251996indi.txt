An QUI of court scilli^ment 
hus been reached in a 1993 
liiwsuil in which John Taylor, 
former IPFW associate profes- 
sor of music, was accused of 
sexual harassment. 

Lisa Summer, former pro- 
fessor of music ai the 
Tennessee Technological 
University (TTU). charged 
TTU as well as Taylor, who 
was Ihc chairperson of ihe 
nU muMC deparimcni, with 
sciiualharjssmenl.

however, and now is the chair 
of the music department ai the 
University of Montcvallo in 
Alabama, according (o Steven 
Sanaiore. dean of the music 
department al IPI^, Sarraiorc 
said Taylor left because he 
wanted lo chair a department, 
not because of ibe controversy 
following the harassment 
charges. 

Greti Danner, chair of the 
department of music and an at 
TfU, said all parties agreed 
mil lo discuss the issue or (he 
selllcmcnl. Danner also said 
Summer does noi iniend lo

Summer was fired from 
TTU on July 23. 1993. on 
Taylor's recomnnendaiion, 
aflct she filed sexual harass- 
mcnl charges against Taylor 
and Ihe university Summer 
was awarded a monetary set-

Taylor justified the dance, say- 
ing it was Just a prank which 
only lasted a minute and thai 
Ihe dancer wore an outfil 
which revealed no more than a 
bathing suit would. He added 
there was no bodily contact, 

TTU claims Summer was 
fired, despite her tenure, 
because she refused to leach

Geoscience department posts student evaluations 



by PaulTuppcr 
Munaging Editor 

In an unprecedented move, the 
department of gcosctenccs 
announced on Jan. 23 its decision 
lo post the mulliple choice portions 
of student evaluations on its web 
site for student access. 

Scott Argasi, chair and associate 
professor of geosciences. brought 
the idea to the rest of the depart- 
ment's faculty, who voted unani- 
mously to add evaluations from the 
previous three semesters and all 
semesters thereafter. 



A story in The Communicator 
("Student access to evaluations 
long way off." Jan, 18, 1996) final- 
ized Argasl's decision to propose 
posting Ihc evaluations. Argast 
said 

"I think it's a good idea. It will 
be helpful when deciding wbo and 
whal to lake." said Adrienne 
Winston, student of criminal jus- 
tice, in response to the geoscience 
department's announcement, 

"Some students will decide not 
to enroll for [geology] cla.s.scs and 
some will choose to do it, I think it 
will work both ways," said Argast, 



According to Argast. students who 
use the web page will find more 
rea.soiu to take geology classes and 
perhaps more will decide to make 
geosciences their major 

"We want to match the student 
with the course. ' said Atgasr 

But some students want to 
match themselves with the right 
instructor 

"Some professors are really mlo 
themselves and where they've 
taught rather than the facts," said 
Nakia Jackson, psychology major, 

Kelly Clark, major undecided, 
values the opinions of fellow stu- 



dents 

"I would (look at available es-al- 
uations] because I want to know 
whal the students think about the 
teachers and the class because they 
are my peers," said Clark. 

For professors, their classes may 
be filled with students who will 
understand the class's purpose and 
objective. 

"The more information people 
have, Ihe better." said Jonathan 
Tankel. associate professor of com- 
munication, "Students should have 
access lo them," he said. 

"Whal I hope is done when they 



put them on a web page is that 
there will be some kind of e:(plana- 
tion as to what these types of ques- 
tions mean, a kind of context of 
what they K'prescnt," Tankel said. 

Argast said he would like to sec 
other departments follow the gco&gt; 
sciences lead. "It's up lo them, btil 
1 don't think it's a bad thing to do. 
But it's up to die individual profes- 
sor." he satd

by Paul Tuppcr 
Managing Editor 

IPFW's first Diversity Week is 
in the planning stages and many 
events have already been scheduled 
for the week of March 1 8-23 

More help is needed to introduce 
ideas and plan events for the cele- 
bration, according to Jeaneitc 
Clausen, chair of modem foreign 
languages, and one of the event's 



coordinators. 

A basketball game which fea- 
tures "The Turnstone Bandits." an 
active team whose members will 
play against IPFW faculty, staff and 
students while both teams are seat- 
ed in wheelchairs, is scheduled for 
Thursday evening. March 21 al 
7:30 p.m. 

"I'll be there, but I don't promise 
a stellar performance," said 
Chancellor Michael Wartell He 



also said his father benefited from 
die invention of the wheelchair. 

Many of llie scheduled events, as 
well as those still in planning, need 
more people to help make die week 
a success, according to Jeanne

IPFW's chapter of Native 
American Students Alliance 
(NASA) IS circulating a petition to 
remove Christopher Peebles, direc- 
tor of the Glen A, Black Laboratory 
of Archeology at Indiana 
University, from his position. 
Statements allegedly made by 
Peebles, as well as some actions, 
offend Native Americans, 

The Indianapolis Star quoted 
Peebles as stating. "Once you are 
dead, you're dead. Your soul leaves 
your body, and then you are just a 
bunch of bones ' Peebles said be 
never spoke to the Star and made 
diese comments. 

The Native American Grave 
Protection and Repatriation Act 
requires universities and museums 
lo return the remains of the 
decca.sed (Jative Americans to their 
original tribe. However, some of 
the bones cannot be identified with 
a tribe. Another obstacle m return- 
ing the bones is that some of the 
tribes cannot be found, 

"We busted our butts to get in 
compliance with this act." said 
Peebles "That included major 
inventory and notification to Native 
American groups, .and site visits by 



two groups." 

Those circulating Ihe petition 
want the remains of Native 
American ancestors returned in 
accordance with certain religious 
beliefs. According to most Native 
American uaditions. die soul docs 
not leave die body upon death but 
radier burial, Arthur Sonicr 
organised the petition ctforl. He 
has asked for die assistance of vari- 
ous NASA branches in circulating 
the petition In a cover letter sent 
out with the petition, .Sonicr 
explained the situation by saying. 
"Whal is there lo leant? By break- 
ing, sawmg, shaving, scraping mar- 
row or shoving them into some 
dark dungeon? We know the 
answer. It is called disrespect for 
our ancestors^' 

In an opinion article published 
in the VIEWPOINT. Sonicr 
enplained the differences between 
burial rites of Western Culture, 
early pioneers and Native 
Americans Westerners arc left 
alone unless murder or foul play 
are possibilities, according to 
Sonier Pioneer graves are treated 
with respect. In contrast, Sonier 
said Native American authorities 
are not contacted when a Native 
American body is found 



IF*FW class offers trip to Rome 



by Nol Bcckley 
Editor 

Imagine exploring the catacombs 
hidden beneath St, Peter's Basilica 
and gazing upon the tomb of St 
Peter This has happened to 
Matthew Kubik. associate professor 
of architectural engineering tech- 
nology, and an IPFW class he 
taught in Rome 

"This is an opportunity to 
explore a culture and history 
beyond the limited scope of Fon 
Wayne." Kubdc said. 

This summer IPFW is offering a 
rare opportunity for students to 
study for two weeks overseas It is 
only the fifth time in university his- 
tory that such an opponunity has 
been offered, according to Kubik. 
Kubik said diis course is the only 
foreign study class initiated by 
IPFW 

IPFW graduate Jeff Tappy trav- 
elled to Rome m 19*»4 with Kubik. 
Tappy dechned to go overseas dur- 



ing bis sophomore year and went 
instead during his senior year, 

"You don't want to pass up the 
opportunity, ■ he said. 

Although Tappy said he does not 
use what he learned in his position 
at the architecture firm of Morrison. 
Caitman and Mcnze, he said he 
knows he will draw from the expe- 
rience later in his career. 

Mary Lou Hutter, office manag- 
er of the Student Academic 
Counseling Services, enrolled in 
last years' class and has nothing but 
praise for it. 

"We went places you would 
ordinarily not go." Huiter said. She 
added that the accommodations 
were wonderful and that the class 
was very well organized. On each 
day of the lour, the class explored 
Rome in historical sequence, 
according to Hutter, She also 
advised anyone interested in die 
class should get in shape to walk 
many miles. 

The department of civil and 



architectural engineering technolo- 
gy and the department of fine arts 
will travel to Rome in July to study 
architecture, art and urban forms of 
the ancient city Kubik will be 
accompanied by Samantha Birk, 
associate faculty in the fine arts 
department and curator of education 
for the Fort Wayne Museum of Ait. 
and Greg Pierceall, professor of 
Landscape Architecture at Purdue. 
West Lafayette. 

Last year. 15 people from IPFW 
experienced the beauty and splen- 
dor of Rome This year, IPFW's 
history department is offering 
Roman history dunng the first sum- 
mer session which will allow stu- 
dents to learn about the city's histo- 
ry and then experience it firsthand 
the second semester 

"The class u-ill put much of what 
is learned in perspective." Kubik 
said. 

Kubik also said the court's fac- 
ulty to student ratio of 1-3 is one of 
the best he has ever seen. 



The course is offered through room and board, travel and bcaldi 

Purdue-West Lafayette' s insurance. The class may be taken 

Continuing Education office and for credit at an additional cost of 

coils around S2400 which covers S327 for Indiana residcnts.

dining room offers even more seat- 
ing. 

Listed on the National Registry 
for historic landmarks, the home was 
built in 1905. It was owned previ- 
ously by Fred Pfeiffer. a descendant 
of one of the founding members of 
Lincoln National Bank. Last sum- 
mer. Clark Valentine began to take 
an inieresi in the home and now leas- 
es the property for his business. The 
new coffee house owner had previ- 
ous experience with coffee through 
his in -house coffee service business, 
but none with running a restaurant. 

"With the little bit of background 
I have with coffee, it was a natural 
movement from office coffee service 
to Ihc house." said Valentine. 

Pfeiffer House offers a broad 
range of coffee delicacies. The house 
serves espresso, cappuccino, cafe 
latte and many different flavors of 
gourmet coffee and hot chocolate. 
House favorites arc (he Milky Way 
Cappuccino (which is pure heaven in 
a dcmiidsse cup) and Cafe Mocha. 
Patrons will also vouch for the 
Pfeiffer House's many deserts, espe- 
cially the canot cake.

Dash In Cafe 
817 Calhoun 

In Ihc Dash In Cafe, the music is 
always playing, whether it comes 
from a musician on acoustic guitar 
or from the stereo. Today Blues 
Traveler resounds throughout the 
small cafe and Tina Kerns is work- 
ing behind ihe counter The sign on 
Ihe wall says, "NO LOITERING. " 
Ironically, everyone here seems to be 
loitering, chattering aw.iy behind 
cups of coffee. 

Everything about the Dash In is 



laid back. One of the regulan, beret 
ilouching jauntily to one side. leans 
back in his chair. Smoke billows out 
of hu cigarette A mural, painted m a 
myriad of gem-like colors, covers 
the back wall. A local anisi's work 
hangs on another wall, waiting for an 
owner Each of the glass-covered 
tables tell.t iLi own story, displaying 
ticket stubs, magazine clippings and 
scrawled notes 

Neil Colching. owner of the

Fori Wayne with big city

mately four years now 
Crowds vary from twen- 
ty-somethings in faded

Old »3 Fire House Cale 
226 W Washington Blvd. 

Taking a look back at some Fori 
Wayne history. Old « Cafe tells a 
story beginning in 1893 with the 
construction of ihe firehouse On 
their way up to cafe, visitors can 
wander through the Firefighters 
Museum, which boasts three differ- 
ent vintage firelrucks and other 
antiques. 

T&gt;ie noise from patrons walking 
on hardwood floors upstairs echoes 
throughout the room. Stuffed 
Dalmatian toys spill out of a red 
chest and sit on the floor next to a 
few small plants Pictures of the fire- 
man's best friend also decorate the 
walls. Tlie cafe has a playful atmos- 



phere to II. 

When asked permission to slide 
down the fireman't pole, owner Ed 
Graf laughed and said, "That's whai 
everyone asks, but we can'i for 
insurance reasons." 

Conveniently located across the 
street from the Allen County 
Library, Old »3 Fire House Cafe 
serves lunch to library visitors as 
well as those who work downtown. 

Old "3 Fire House Cafe offers a 
menu of sandwiches, soups and sal- 
ads for hungry patrons. Queenie, a 
Dalmatian who once gave birth to 
ten puppies, has her own sandwich 
named "Qucenie and Her Ten." 

With lis history and friendly staff, 
Old #3 IS a great place to drop by for 
lunch. Kids and any "101 
Dalmatians" fan will also enjoy the 
museum and the cafe's playful 
decor. 

Coney Island 
131 W. Main St 

A sign on the wall says "Coney 
Island— Since 1914. OUR BUNS 
ARE STEAMED" Coney Island, m 
downtown Fort Wayne at 131 W 
Main St.. knows how to sell hot 
dogs. This IS the kind of advertising 
that keeps loyal customers coming 
back for years. 

The smell of greasy chili, onions 
and cigarette smoke fill the air. The 
clientele is varied — a man sits with 
his two children who could be no 
more than eight or nine years old. At 
a table near the back iwo middle- 
aged women sit munching coneys 
and drinking Coke right from Ihe 
bottle. The decor is sparse, consist- 
ing mostly of a few pictures hung on 
the otherwise bare walls. Tlie pic- 
tures are advertising posters from 
years past or news clippings from 
local newspapers. 

Serving Coney dogs in a diiiy red 
apron is Frank Vinson. He has been 
employed by Coney Island for the 
belter pan of (S years. In fact, this is 
his fu-si job. Vinson says the reasons 
he stays are simple. 

"It's the atmosphere. Most of the 
diners are regulars whose orders I 
know by heart. People come here for 
Ihe great chili dogs and, of course, 
the atmosphere. 'ITie biggest reason 
is my boss [Russ Choka], He has a 
hcan like a hotel and is great lo work 
for," said Vinson, 

I assume this is a compliment and 



1 aiiempt to min- 
gle with the reg- 
ulars: they are 
kind and poliie. 
but suspicious 
Most probably 
wonder at my 
hidden motive 



for 



ling 



their sanctuary 
and asking why 
they cat here. 
They have no 
trouble explain- 
ing why they 
keep coming 
back, day after 
day, however 
As one regular 
said: 

"People come 
for Ihe atmos- 
phere; It IS old- 
fashioned and 
pleasant. This 
place IS practi- 
cally a land- 
mark." 

Do not be 
fooled by these 

legitimate-sounding excuses; they 
just want a tasie of those famous 
"STEAMED BUNS," 

Cindy's Diner 
S30 S. Harrison 

Stepping into Cindy's Diner at 
the corner of Harrison and W 

Wayne St.. is like travelling back to 
a simpler time. The owner John 
Scheele greets customers as they 
come through the door: in fact, most 
of them are greeted by name. It 
seems that everyone at the counter is 
a regular. On a shelf behind the 
counter is a glass case for coffee 
mugs. The major difference here is 
none of the glasses match. A Tweeiy 
Bird mug catches my eye I ask if 
you have to be special lo drink from 
this bnght yellow, plastic mug. 

"That IS one of our regular's." 
said Scheele, He brought ihc mug 
awhile back and uses it every day. 
All Ihe mugs in that case are owned 
by regulars. They bring them in and 
use them and just leave ihcm here." 

I am sealed ai ihe counter dnnk- 
ing coffee. I glance at the menu and 
something catches my eye.

Paul Sieferl chals with JeK "Salad" Adams al The Dash In Cafe. 



"1 would like to have an order of 
'Garbage,'" I say 

1 have never eaten "Garbage '" It 
arrives and looks like an omelet that 
has gone through a blender. Garbage 
consists of scrambled eggs, ham, 
onions, cheese and tastes tike a 
southern omelet 

Scheele and his wife of 39 year^, 
Cindy (her real name), opened the 
diner on Oct. 1, 1990. after buying it 
in April and then relocating and ren- 
ovating It. John, who prefers to be 
called "Mr. Cindy," also owns a con- 
struction business. He came home 
one day in 1990 with the idea of 
opening his own restaurant and nam- 
ing it after his wife The business has 
prospered, although it was difficuli 
getting started. 

"Owning a restaurant is nothing 
ai all like owning your own con- 
siniclion business," (2indy said. "We 
had 10 learn everything from 
scratch." 

And learn Ihey did. Cindy's has a 
complete menu, including great cof- 
fee and daily lunch specials 
Cindy's, which is open weekdays 
from 6 am. to 8 p.m. and from 7 



a.m. to 2 p.m. on weekends, provides 
a second home for an enthusiastic 
group of regulars, many of whom 
dine there every day. 

"I have been coming here for four 
years, averaging at lca.st one visit per 
day." said Jim Uarigcn. devoted rcg-\ 
ular "The atmosphere is so relaxed. 
The conversations you can gel into 
are just great. It's kind of a break 
from reality." 

The landmark status of Cindy's 
has led to visits by the rich and 
famous as well. A thick binder that 
serves as a guest book sits on the 
counter with signatures from many 
of Hollywood's own, as well as 
scores of signatures from around the 
world. People from England and 
Africa sat in the same humble stools. 
Nostalgia fills Ihc aii as Cindy talks 
about famous individuals who have 
dined here. 

Another sign on the wall summa- 
rizes the philosophy behind Cindy's: 

"We give friendly, good service 
at reasonable prices. If we fail to do 
so. please don't tell anyone."

The rebirth of alternatiue 
music: Ben Folds Flue 






by Amanda Manion 
Features Editor 

Looking for some truly 
"alternative" music? Then 
check out Ben Folds hive. 
the newest group to emerge 
from a hotbed of creativity 
in Chapel Hill. NC (home to 
Archers of Loaf. Dillon 
Fence. Polvo). The trio 
(Yes. trio. Five sounded bet- 
ter to tbe guys than three) is 
composed of Ben Folds and 
his baby grand piano. Robert 
Sledge playing a fuzzy bass 
and Darren lessee keeping 
the back beai on drums. 

What makes Ben Folds 
Five so "allcmativc" in a 
musical world of Pearl Jam 
clones, whining grunge 
bands, and brooding, bitter 
divas Ls their absolutely gui- 
tar-less music On their self- 
titled debut album, the Tirsi 
track "Jackson Cannery " 
opens with Folds poundmg 
away on the ivories. The 
chords are a refreshing 
wake-up call, saying, "Yes, 
truly alternative music still 
exists. It isn't just a label 
that music executives slap 
on anything that crawls out 
of Seattle." 

Ben Folds Five's music is 
witty, complex and sophisti- 
cated. The first single 
released off of the album, 
"Underground," exhibits all 
three qualities and is receiv- 
ing considerable air-time on 
the local alternative radio 
station In "Underground" 
Ben Folds Five snidely 
thumbs their collective nose 
at the present state of the 
"alternative" scene. ("1 love 
to mix m circles, cliques and 
social coteries/Hand me my 
nose ring") Folds pounds out 
the chords once again in 
"Underground," but then, 
showing his broad range as a 
composer, the song jumps 
in an im pro visational- sound- 
ing jazz direction 

Tbe band is relentless in 



extending iLs creative free- 
dom on this debut. Listeners 
can pick out bits of musical 
Cicrshwin and "Jesus Christ 
Superstar" quotes in various 
songs. Lyrically, the music 
looks at both serious and 
light-hearted moments in 
life. In "Alice Childress" 
Folds writes of disillusion- 
ment with the world 
Switching gears, "Uncle 
Walter" tells Ihe 
SI or y 
of pro- 



a b a n - 
donmeni 



On the whole. Ben Fold^. 
Five's music is reminiscent 
of Squeeze from the early 
ttOs or an early Elton John i&lt;( 
Billy Joel, Folds' vout 
which sounds akm m 
Fitddie Mercury, along witb 
his story-like lyrics. hring\ 
images of early Queen in 
mind Tbe CD has a po«it 
pop feel and Folds himscll 
classifies the music as "puiik 
rock foi 



man who 
lives out 
of his 
aim chair 
("You 
know he's 
been 
around the 
world/Last 



flew to Baghdad in his mag- 
ical armchair") The song 
"Boxing" is an imagined 
conversation between 
Mohammed Ali and Howard

XPGSA president ^vorks hard, 
accomplishes little 



Missouri's stale tnollo is "Stiow me," 

ianel Jacluon sang "What have you done for 
mc lately?" 

Nike wants you to "Just do il." 

We at the Communicalor want to send these 
words to Indiana-Purdue Student Government 
Association (IPSGA) President Kevin Eads 
because be ha.s done nothing but talk 

We have no doubt Eads wants to do some- 
thing for the students, but he lacks the necessary 
drive and ambition to DO anything. He was 
elected on the promise of being accessible and 
trfCective. He may be accessible, but he is in no 
way effective You could say he's the Millard 
Fillmore of ibe nmciics 

Eads won the hearts of voters by making 



some big promises He said he wanted to make 
Walb Union student comfortable for students by 
adding student an work, musicians and poetry 
for a coffee house-type feel He also won votes 
by promising to bring national concert acts to 
IPFW, a feat accomplished by most other uni- 
vcTiities Eads also promised to get student eval- 
uations to the students to preview before regis- 
tering for classes. If you read our story on page 
one, the Conununicator accomplished this on its 
own 

Most of the IPSGA's work consisLs of tabling 
issues for more discussion and depending on the 
Student Activities Board to aeaie activities and 
make decisions for ihc greater good 

The last administration was headed by Mark 



King We may have disagreed with some of the 
decisions he made, but we respected him for 
having the courage to make a decision. He suc- 
ceeded in laying the groundwork for student 
access to the Inicmet and creating the Tirst cabi- 
net in IPSGA history Eads waited eight months 
to appoint a complete cabinet. What was he 
doing for those eight months- Sending E-mail 
to the whole campus? 

We hope he is not eitpccting the cabinet to do 
his work. We know the cabinet members and 
doubt diey want to do his job without pay, Eads' 
gels paid for his position from student funds. As 
his employers, we should demand some work 
for our dolL'u or a refund 



Commentary 



Boomerbox, part III 



To the students: 

If you did it the right way, you made 
your fonune and are now attending class- 
es to improve yout mind, Fmanccs arc the 
least ol your worries, .ind you're concen- 
tTBting on the power of knowledge 

You know, there arc actually such indi- 
viduals here at WipeyPoo I spoke with 
one and found him awesome and inspir- 
ing, a bright testimony to the hope thai 
comes with learning. 

The rest of us who ure not so forcisigbi- 
cd or fortunate have sorry nights with 



overdue bills nagging and snarling 
beneath our textbooks, h's a tough row to 
hoe for sure, but press on regardless. We 
have a world to fix and we're running out 
of time We owe il to the kids it's 
important, and it's a mindset that's going 
to help you leap over that pde of home- 
work and gnarly yapping creditors Here's 
a htOe insight 1 picked up from that suc- 
cessful individual: 

Arc you in die "self-improvement " bag 
or the "world- improvement" bag? There 
is a difference. Most of us who have been 
domg this reluming adult student gig for a 



while have noticed that the self-improve- 
ment folks have a tougher time hacking it 
Thai's because they seek a better pay- 
check, and in today's rapacious, greed-o- 
rama climate ol predatory capitalism, that 
probably ain't goiuia happen. That's what 
we need to change. 

Seek a belter world instead. Most of us 
older folks have had the idealism stomped 
out of us by pod people and dipdunks in 
the workaday world I3et it back. Don't let 
them rob you of the vision and the dream 
Go touch that long black wall in 
Washington DC Look into the eyes of a 



little person. Remember diose days when 
we wanted to change the world, give 
peace a chance, when ail we needed was 
love. We don't have to change the world 
by ourselves We just have to change our- 
selves without fear of being the only one 
You're not the only one Don't lose the 
vision. Don't lose the dream Wc don't 
have much more than that. We don't need 
much more

The definition of freedom must include freedom of

J Letter to the editor 



Columnist 
wrong to assume 
babyboomers 
like title 



To the editor 

I appreciate people wiih different views on 
hfe This compels me to respond to an article, 
"The Identity Crisis," by Paul Tupper. pnnted 
Jan 16. 1996. 

Paul, as a person in your twenties, you resent 
the names given to your generation, yet you 
perpetuate die name calling by classifying the 
individuals who ask you to "identify" yourself 
as "boomers." As a "babyboomer," I have gone 
through the whole gamut of name calling, 1 was 
a "hippie," a "yippee." a "yuppie," and now a 
"boomer " These names qualified me as a pot- 
bead, self-centered, money-grubbing, 
exploitable individual Well, when I was a "hip- 
pie" I never did or have smcc done drugs When 
I was a "yippee " I was raising four children as a 
single parenL leaving bitlc time to be self-cen- 
tered. I make less than (wcniy thousand dollars 
a year, so can I quahfy as a "yuppie''" And now 
that I am a "l)oomer" I can bask m the knowl- 
edge thai I will never receive Social Security 
benefits because 1 fall at Lhc end of tbe 
"boomers." Oh yes, there is another name used 
for those busy people of my generation — 
"dinks" (double income, no kids). As a mother 
of four. I think I'm out of my category here too. 

Maybe you should give more thought to the 
fact dial when a person falls into a demographic 
area it does not mean all the characteristics 
apply to all mdividuals in the demography Give 
the Profs a chance and let them Imow why you 
don't fall imo your demography. Maybe, just 
maybe, they really want to know what makes 
Paul Tupper tick.

some cojones 



Jim 
Porter 




As bad as il may seem Id be a 
Hoosier, we can be gratcrul wc do 
not live in Nebraska. If you recall. I 
used diis very space earlier in ihc 
semester to address die problems 
raced by Ihc Nebraska football 
(cam and ceriain players v^ho 
incurred ruD'-ins wiih ibe law. Now, 
il has happened in our own humble 
stale. 

Last weekend Sherron 
Wilkerson, a sianing guard on the 
Indiana University basketball team, 
bad a run-in with Ibe aulborilies 
slcmming Trom an alleged incident 
involving his girlfriend and a fight 
The cops were called to her apart- 
ment and al her request. Wilkerson 
was removed from ihe premises. 

Wilkerson flaily denied slapping 
her and says he only pushed her in 
rage. What Ls die difference when it 
is violence against another person, 
nevermind a woman? And whal 
about ihe bile marks on the back of 
her neck, Sherron? 

1 am willing to give die young 
man ihe benefil of the doubt, if 
only because I fail to understand 
how a man can hil (push) a woman 
and still feci good about tiijnself. 

Coach Knight, aka "The 
General." has not been so opti- 



mistic in regard to 
Wilkerson's situa- 
tion. In a news 
release issued by 
the Indiana 

University sports 
information depan* 
meni. Knight 
announced he had 
dismissed 
Wilkerson from the 
team and that steps 
were initiated to 
revoke bis scholar- 
ship. Way lo go 
Bob! 

Understand thai I am not a big 
fan of Coach Knighl. In fact, I 
would go so far as lo say my 
impression of him leans more 
toward disrespect. 1 have disrespect 
for the way he publicly humiliates 
his players, disrespect for his 
inability to control his anger ■ 
remember the incident during last 
year's NCAA lournameni?- and 
disrespect for the overall outward 
character that personifies Bob 
Knighl as a coach. 

However, you have to tip your 
hai to Knighl and ibe way in which 
he has handled "Sherron-gaie," 
Unlike Nebraska's head coach, 
Tom Osborne. Knight understands 
the disgrace Wilkerson's actions 
have brought lo Ihe basketball 
leam. He look a stand. 

You have to wonder if some- 
thing else is going on here. Knight 
is noted for his iron-fisted, discipli- 
narian attitude. He is a no bull kind 
of guy. But remember. Knight has 
given other players the benefil of 
the doubt, In Ihe laie 1970s a num- 
ber of players were suspended from 
liie leam for smoking poi at a hotel 
in Alaska. In the case of Landon 
Turner, who was paralyzed in a car

Knighl lock Turner under his wing 
and saw the young man through ihe 
hardest time of bis ichabiliialion. 
Knowing Turner had a problem. 
Knigbl sought to help him gel back 
onu^k 

So. what IS the difference wiih 
Wilkerson? I would speculate this 
last action is jusi the straw ihai 
broke the camel's back. Obviously 
Wilkerson is noi a model citizen. 
Remember the incident leading to 
bis being stripped of Ibe Mr 
Daskelball title'' He is a crybaby 
who is used to getting his way. not 
unlike a great number of collegiate 
and professional athletes today. I 
wonder if this same altitude led to 
Ihe Tight involving Wilkerson and 
his girlfriend. He was not going to 
gel his way so be lashed out. 

You would think one of these 
days athletes would gel the hint. 
Why has no one learned from the 
problems faa'd by previous adiletes 
who incurred problems with the 
law? Maybe the stereotypical, 
"dumb jock" is applicable in some 

Whether Wilkerson is truly 

guilty of wrongdoing is beside ihe 
point. The pomi here is we should 
all be thankful we do not live in 
Nebraska where success in the aih- 
lelic arena means freedom from 
responsibility in the "real world." 
Like him or not. Bob Knighl look a 
stand. He made his position known 
and has shown his team, as well as 
die rest of college adiletes, violence 
is unacceptable. You have to lip 
your hat to die coach. 

Take it as you will. Just remem- 
ber, Ihe view from under the 
bleachers is full of butts.

III 




with Brad Pricditis 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

For inside bitter Brad Prieditis. 
Dec. 29, 1995. is forever etched in 
his mind. It was the day he wcni 
under the knife to repair a torn 
anterior cruciaic ligamenl in his lefi 
knee. As a result, Priedilis sat oui 
the entire season last year. It was 
hell on him. 

This season. Priedilis embraces 
the opportunity to once again play 
an integral part on the men's vol- 
leyball team. 

"I am like a kid at Christmas 
time," Priedilis said, "Ii has been so 
long. Jusi 10 hear the whistles, to be 
in front of a crowd again, Ihe com- 
petition. It IS fun." 

The competilion drives him lo 
be the best possible player he can 
be. Whether it is leading the leam 
wiih statistics or in a more vocal 
manner, Priedilis sees his role as 
undefined but defiantly as a leader 

Personally, Priedilis believes the 
team can once again return to the 
"promised land" of the Final Four. 

"We have discussed il as a leam 
and I think we can get there," 
Priedilis said. 

But first things first. This year's 
men's volleyball is young and docs 
not have the firepower it has had in 
previous seasons. 

"Volleyball is a team sport, but 
one guy can take over a whole 



match. We don't h-ive dio,st kind ol 
players," Priedilis said, "1 think thai 
everybody realizes thai and we 
have t)cgun lo play more together. 
This team has a loi of guls and 
pride." 

A sign of their pride was dis- 
played last weekend as the team 
traveled lo California and faced 
some of the top competition in col- 
legiate volleyball While the team 
did not come up with any upset 
wins, they did play well and a lot 
more consistently than last season 

"We did a lot of good things in 
California," Priedilis said "Now 
we jus! need lo work on the liille 
things." 



Ilie little things include icing a 
knee after practice and being 
booked to a machihc that stimulalcv 
bis tendons electronically for 
Priedilis. No matter, he is on the 
court this year and while his knee 
may not be at 100 percent, it func- 
tions well enough for him to be 
able to once again experience ihc 
on-coun joys of the game he loves. 

Just to be in front of the crowd 
again, to hear the whistles, for 
Priedilis it's al! fun and he is cer- 
tainly happy lo once again be a 
contributing mcmtwr of the men's 
volleyball leam.

Women's basketball team loses two conference games 



by Jim Port«r 
Spnrli fLdllor 

ATtei luning the season wiib 14 
wirit anti no Iunci. Ihc women'} 
buskctb-dll (cam dropped Iwo gama 
in u row hi\ week. 

Againti InJIanapolis. the 'Dons 
were oulscorcd 47-40 in tlic firsi 
hair and the Lady (&gt;rcyht&gt;unds bung 
on tn dcfcal the TXjiii 90-84 ]| was 
Ihc seventh siraigbl lime Ibe 
Mastndons have lost to 
Indianapolis. 

The Dons second loss came 



af;ainsi Northern Kcniuclcy The 
Norse look advantage of weak 
rebounding by Ihc 'Dons to win 75- 
57. 

In both games the major down- 
fall for ibc 'Ooru was inconsuicncy 
on defense and poor rebounding, 
according to Coach Pam Bowdcn 

■*ll was ugly,"' Bowden said, 
'There are no excuses. Maybe we 
got a little complaccni." 

Whether the team was compla- 
cent or jusi lacking in concenlra- 
tjon. Bowden and Assistant Coach 
Tom Sutherland arc taking steps lo 



make sure ii docs not b^pen again. 

TTiis week, practice looked more 
hke 3 ixack meet than a basketball 
practice. The team was running 
sprints for every mistake. 

"Wc want ihcm lo know thai we 
arc not going to lose." Bowden 
said This is whai is going to hap- 
pen when wc lose If ihcy are com- 
plaining now about being 
sore. ..(hey should have been think- 
ing about being sore on Thursday 
and Saturday last week." Bowden 
said 

The biggest disappoinimen( for 



Bowden IS (he fac( that both losses 
were conference games. 

"We could have been 9-0. iwo 
games ahead of everyone else, " 
Bowden said, "Now we have (o 
s(cal some games, win some ihat 
maybe wc shouldn't and sneak out 
of the gym." 

The schedule docs not gel any 
friendlier for the 'Dons. Two more 
road games diis week wdl couinly

(cam. On Thursday (he "Dons face

Interleague just what baseball needs 



In (he early 
days of 




^ Nc' 



Brooklyn 

Dodgers ver- 
' York Yankees World 



Scncs, Then, one of (be mosi dcv- 
a.stiiting events in all of sports his- 
tory moved (he beloved Dodgers lo 
Los Angeles, Even aficr the move, 
baseball continued however. 
Perhaps ihe Dodger's move was 
needed (o give baseball a shot in 
Ihc arm. Perhaps that is wha( is 
needed now wi(h (he in(roduciion 
of interleague play. With baseball 
still trying (o recover from Ihc 
embarrassing labor dispute, which 
by the way is not sc((lcd, the game 
needs a boost of energy to get the 
fans back in the stands. 

With (he beginning of in(er- 
league play, (hink of (he rivalries 
that will he created in a sp.&gt;n that 



is struggling for popularity. The 
Chicago Cubs against Ihc cross 
town White Sox or the Bailie for 
Ohio with the Reds playing the 
Indians. Although it might noi cre- 
ate much interest, maybe a rivalry 
with the Yankees would bring oui 
Ihe best in the Meis. Creating such 
matchups will not only draw fans 
lo root against their arch enemies, 
it will also take some travel strain 
off of the teams involved Even 
though die game would technically 
be an away game for the road 
team, ii would still draw many 
local fans. 

It is time for baseball to try lo 
make up ground lost to football 
and haskciball. In a spon with 182 
games a season there should be 
room somewhere tor 25-30 inter- 
league games 

As fara.s the designated hitter 
is concerned, implement ihc same 
rules used in (he World Series. If 
the game is played in a Nalion.'^l 
League park, the DH will not be 
used, but if the game is in an 
American League park, then use a 
DH. 

As for all you diehard baseball 
fans who ihink Ihe game is going 
down (he lube, think about this: an 



increase in popularity would cause 
an increase in prime time games on 
national television. This would 
mean no more wailing for your 
favorite team to visit a city near 
you. and no more watching your 
team on the local biased cable 
channel. Plus, fans who are only 
able to watch local games would 
be exposed to some of ihe other 
superstars that MLD has to offer. 
For instance. I hate lo break it lo 
you Cubs fans, bui they have this 
guy across town named Frank 
Thomas who might be worth 
watching some lime. 

The NFL uses interleague play 
and fans love ii. The same goes 
for the NBA Fans love to see dif- 
ferent players, and the NFL and 
NBA try lo expose their superstars 
10 every fan in every market If 
baseball is to regain the national 
spoilighl something new and excit- 
ing has to be done. It's time for 
Ihc game lo be relumed to the fans, 
especially Ihc younger generation. 
The only way to do that is to give 
people a reason to watch, 
Interleague play could be that rea- 
son.

Joseph's. 

"They can cither rise to the ocva- 
sion or choke." Bowden said, "Wc 
can recover but they need to prove 
to us they are ready lo go," 

The team has concentrated mon; 
on defense and rebounding this 
week. Very lillle lime has been 
spent on the offensive side of the 
court. 

"We need lo face reality. They 
need to know that wc are not going 
to lose and IT we do. ii will be the 



same son of thing acxi week." 
Bowden said. 

"Wc are not going lo play to the 
opponents level. We need to piny as 
well as wc are capable of playing." 

"They are not going to want to 
come into ihe gym on Monday if 
wc lose this weekend," 

AccotUing to Bowden there ore 
no excu^-s for the tack of intensity 
last week and it will not be tolerat- 
ed again. 



The men's basketball team con- 
tinues to struggle with a 2-7 record 
in the GLVC The latest victors 
over the Mastodons include

more inspired brand of basketball. 



Aficr trailing by eight points at 
haltlime, the 'Dons ran neck and 
neck with the Norse Both teams 
scored 39 poinis in the second half. 
Once again ihe go-to guy for the 
■Dons was Bond who scored 15 
pomis. Ryan Glidden added 12 The 
difference in the game came from 
the free throw line where the Norse 
hit 19-of-24 alicmpts. The 
Mastodons hit only 3-of-6.

The streak is over After vl.ininf! 
the sca.son with a 14-gajnc winning 
streak. Ihc women's basketball 
learn lost both of its games on the 
road last week. 

The major problem for. Ihe 
'Dons was a lack of rebounding 
and defensive intensity. 

The team's First loss of the sea- 
son came against Indianapolis who 
own a seven game winning streak 
agamst ihe 'Dons. Despite a game- 



hn!h S} poinis from All-Amcrican 
Lindy Jones, the Ma.slodons lost 
90-84 No other player reached 
double Figur\:s in scoring. 

Against the Norse, Jones 
scorched the nets for 25 points, 
including a perfect 11-of-ll from 
the free throw line. Reserve fresh- 
man Jessica Henry tallied II while 
bitting 4-of-7 from the field. 

The Dons trailed by only one 
point alter iho First hall but were 



DuLstorcd 46-29 in Ihc second halF 
I'or NKU. three players tallied 
double Figures. Alison McCarthy 
and Stephanie Jordan shared team- 
high honors with 18 poinis each. 

The biggest difference in the 
game was the rebounding edge 
NKU was able to establish. The 
Norse outu'bounded the Mastodons 
43 to 29 in die game.
