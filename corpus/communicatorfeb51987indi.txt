Students may pay for Bulletin 



By MICIIELE K. SHAFFER 
Editor-in-Chief 

Students may find themselves paying 
for copies of the new IPFW Bulletin 
according to a new university policy. 

Ten thousand IPFW Bulletins - good 
for the 1986-87 through 1987-88 academic 
years —were printetJ for distribution to 
stall, faculty, students and ad- 
ministrators, Joanne Lantz, assistant 
vice chancellor, said. 

Last year, Lanli said, the university 
liad 25,000 of the 1985-87 Bulletins 
printed. All of them were dislribuled. 



"People would pick up a Bullelin every 
time they would need to look up ap- 
parently one thing, ' Lantz said. "That 
is not a good use of resources." 

Lantz said the university therefore 
had lo develop a policy lo control Ihe 
distribution of the Bulletins, According 
lo Ihe new policy, every faculty, staff 
and adminislralion member, and ad- 
visor will receive a free copy of the 
Bulletin. Every ' student, either ad- 
mitted or allowed re-enlry to IPFW 
after Sept. 1. 1986, will also receive a 
complimentary copy. These students 



are the only students whose studies 
come under the guise of the new 
Bullelin, Lanl7. said. The copies of the 
Bulletin are now available in the Office 
of Admissions, 

Lantz said there will be copies of the 
Bullelin available for consultation in 
Ihe Helmke Library and in other 
university offices. 

Beyond Ihat, it a student loses his free 
copy or a sludenl whose studies are not 
governed by the new Bullelin wants a 
copv, he or she will have to buy one, 
Lan'lz said. The Bulletins will be sold 



for $2 in Follett's Bookstore. 

Lanlz explained only the sludenls 
admitted to IPFW or allowed re-entry 
to IPFW after Sepl, I, 1986 will receive 
free copies because lliey are the only 
sludenls whose studies are controlled 
by the outlines in-tlie new Bullelin. 

In the past, Untz said, the Bulleiins 
have been free of charge to all students, 
faculty, staff and administrators. But 
due lo printing costs and the apparent 
misuse of the availability of the 
Bullelin, the university has had 1 begin 
charging for second copies.

Gifted students giten chance to shine 



By MICHELE R, SHAFFER 

Editor-in-Chief 

Gifted and talented youngsters in the 
West Lafayette, IN, area have a chance 
lo e.&lt;(cel thanks to a program initiated 
by Purdue University's Gifted 
Education Resource Institute. 

Students, from pre-school through 
high school, can enroll in Purdue's 
Super Saturday program for gifted 
students,, Classes include subjects like 
chess, folklore, dinosaurs and com- 
puters. 

This year, some students may even 
get a bead start on college. "This time 
we're offering four courses for credit .,, 
Students from grades seven through 12 
can lake Ihese courses and apply them 
toward college credit," said Debbie 



Huckman. Super Saturday coordinator 
in Purdue's Gifted Education Resource 
Institute, 

The courses applicable toward 
college credit include Communication 
114; GS290 iStudy Skills Seminar); 
Psychology 120, and CLCS 101 (First 
Course in Lalini , The cosi of the classes 
is $187,50, the amount of Purdue 
University tuition. 

Other subjects aimed at younger 
children include creative thinking (age 
5 and kindergarleni. Children's 
Literature Through Creative Drama 
(grades one and twoi. Young 
Astronauts (grades two and three). 
Fables, Folklore and Mylhology 
(grades two and three). Sign Language 



(grades Ihrec through live) and Drama 
and Pantomime (grades four through 
six ) , The fee for most of these classes is 
teo. 

"Last fall we had our biggest 
enrollment ever and we're offering 
more than fifty courses (this 
semester)," Ruckman said. 

The classes, which start Feb. H, 
meet on Saturday moriungs from 9:30- 
il :30 a.m. through April 18. 

Another course will be offered lo 
parents of gifted children. The one-hour 
credit course offered concerns 
parenting the gifted child, "This is an 
excellent course that is especially 
helpful lo parents who wanl in-depth 
information on the subject." Ruckman

Students join the ranks 
of government's poor 



Are you still making payments on your 
college tuition loan? Or, if older, making 
payments on your child's tuition loan? 

If you are like many Americans, for 
whom education is important, you fall in 
one of these categories. Maybe both. 
Education is a valued part of the 
success of America. Consider the ideals 
of the American way of life. Compare 
today's world with yesterday's Two of 
the most common and most dominant 
beliefs in America today are that 
America is a land of opportunities and 
that individuals are responsible for their 
own success. With this in mind, people 
are constantly trying to make a better 
wheel. America has grown over the 
years in science, industry and business. 
The one thing permitting this to happen, 
the one thing at the core of this success, 
is priucation. 

If education is such a valuable key to 
the success of American today, why is 
our government making such severe 
restrictions in financial aid? 

Students and parents alike are 
wondering why the cutbacks are 
coming, at a time when college costs are 
higher than they've ever been At the 
same time most family's income has not 
increased proportionally and students 
have to go to other sources for financial 
aid — primarily the government. At the 
same time, the federal deficit has been 
increasing each year. Compounded with 
an administration which focuses on 
national defense and cuts the budget in 
other, more elastic areas like education 
Educational grants and scholarships are 
not exempt 

Neither are student loans. That is a big 
problem. With all the cutbacks, students 
and their families have had to rely 
increasmgiy on the loans. Students — at 
today's tuition costs — could graduate 
from college with tuition loan debts of 
anywhere from SIO.OOO to $20,000. 

With all the qualification restrictions 
now being placed on students, that may 
be hurt. It will be harder for students to 
establish independent status and meet 
the need-finance test to qualify for a 
loan. That test was formerly required 
only of families with an income of S30,000 
or more. Now all applicants must meet 
the test 

What are the alternatives? How can 
students pay for the college education 
they really need'' It seems our 
government thinks the answer is the 
family. 



In Indiana, the House Education 
Committee unanimously passed the 
BEST program. Whether it is really the 
best the state has to offer is 
questionable. 

Under the program, the parents would 
invest a set amount into a state 
administered fund. The fund would 
guarantee the child's tuition at any 
state-supported Indiana college or 
university. If the child chooses to attend 
a private college when he gets older, he 
will receive a tuition transfer that is 
equal to the amount it would cost to 
attend a state-supported university at 
the time. 

A big problem with this bill, which will 
go to the House now that it has been 
passed in Committee, is that it places the 
full responsibility for investing $3000 or 
$4000 in college tuition on the parents 
when a child is still a toddler. It 
emphasizes investing money at a time 
when parents are loaded down with 
many other financial obligations that 
come with raising children 

A program that should be suggested 
and implemented is one that, at least 
partially, puts the responsibility for 
funding of college on the student. One 
program would be to allow students to 
stretch out their loan for longer than ten 
years. This program would more than 
likely be income contingent. Currently 
the government is experimenting with 
this program and hopes to expand it 
from a $5 million program to a S600 
million program next year 11988&gt;, 

This program would not place a 
burden on parents if they cannot spare 
the money while alleviating the pressure 
loans normally place on new graduates. 
It would not be such a large percentage 
of their earnings at a time when salaries 
are likely the lowest in their careers. 

This program could conceivably lower 
the rale of loan defaults the government 
has to deal with. 

Either way, the government has to 
decide on something soon. It has to 
realize parents cannot (and usually do 
not), foot the whole bill for their 
children's college education. The 
administration also has to keep in mind 
that with each slash made in financial 
aid programs, they are limiting 
opportunities for prospective college 
students to finance their college careers. 




—Letters to the Editor 



Red adds color, gives 
excitement to candy 



Inflation, rising taxes, loss of federal 
aid to students, impending nuclear 
holocaust, widespread communism, 
isn't there something in this country to 
believe in? 

Yes! There is something. A light at the 
end of the tunnel, a silver lining on a 
cloud, a role model, a hero. 

The M&amp;M-Mars Company. 

Why M&amp;M-Mars as an American 
Hero? Because they are bringing back 
red M&amp;M's! 

Starting in February 20 percent of the 
100 million M&amp;M's made each day will 
be red. Eleven years ago red M&amp;M's 



were discontinued because of the red dye 
scare. Red M&amp;M's do not have the red 
dye and manufacturers have decided to 
give us back what was so cruelly taken 
from us. 

Perhaps M&amp;M's-Mars just realized 
how boring packages of M&amp;M's were 
without the red. Three fluorescent colors 
and two shades of brown just never had 
the impact one red M&amp;M did. 

Maybe now that we've got our red 
M&amp;M's back, we can get some of our 
financial aid back. Or will we have to 
wait another eleven years? 



Smoking out 

Tu the Edllur: 

Cigarette smoking has 
become quite a controversial 
issue these days. A smoker 
wishes to exercise his 
freedom to smoke whenever 
and wherever l» chooses, 
and the non-smoker yearns 
(0 tire^the clean air void of 
irritating pollutants. 

Smoking policies began to 
be introduced by many 
companies and schools 
which reslrJcled smokers lo 
designated areas wilhm 
their buildings. For a short 
time, this solution was an 
acceptable compromise for 
bolt) sides until science 
uncovered undisputable 
evidence which proved 
second hand smoke to be as 
harmful lo the non-smoker 
as Ihe cigarette was to the 
smoker. A great number of 
people became alarmed and 
mandated changes in the 
existing smoking policies. 
Soon companies concerned 
about the welfare of their 
employees issued notices 
prohibiting cigarette 
smoking from within the 
facilities owned by the 
company. 

In Illinois, one company 
went a bit loo far when they 
decided to give their em- 
ployees an ultimatum to 



either &lt;iuit smoking both on 
and off their premises or lose 
their jobs. After reading this, 
I began wondering to myself 
if new employment ap- 
plications would be 
necessary slating in part

] feel this company's 
actions were extreme and 
absurd, nevertheless. I 
strongly advocate and 
support the elimination of 
tobacco smoke from any 
building which is accessible

located on campus at IPFW.

Students lose 

To the editor: 

A nationally-recognized 
volleyball team is worlh 
making a fuss about, ac- 
cording lo Chancellor 
Wallace IJournal Gazette, 
Jan. as, 1987). And what of 
IPFW's nationally- 
recognized professors? 

We, loo, commend the 
volleyball team for its 
performance. The team 
certainly deserves a greater 
reward than that which it 
lias received. Then again, 



IPFWs nationally- 
recognized professors 
deserve a greater reward 
than that which our chan- 
cellor has bestowed. 

in the case ot Professor 
Kulick of the Modern 
Foreign language depart- 
ment reward may already be 
3 moot issue. Professor 
Kulick has been notified that 
she will not l&gt;e reappointed 
for the next school year 
because she has not com- 
pleted her dissertation. iShe 
had previously been granted 
until the end of the 1936-67 
school year in which to 
complete her doctorate, and 
is still on schedule lo do so. ) 

Professor Kulick is 
uniquely qualified as a 
French professor, however. 
Last spring she served in the 
Oral Proficiency Training 
Workshop, a national 
program held in conjunclion 
with the Foreign Service 
Institute. She was one of only 
IS insU-uclors in the nation 
selected to do so. 

The nation recognizes her 
worth as a French in- 
structor. Does Chancellor 
Wallace? 

11 would seem a con- 
sistency is lacking when a 
volleyball team is lauded 
while a quality professor is 
dismissed. 

Those who suffer the loss 
trom that dismissal, of 



course, are IPFW's 
students; Chancellor 
Wallace has already been to 
school, and Professor Kulick 
will, doubtless, gel another 
assignment. 

We know now how 
Chancellor Wallace feels 
about sports. What remains 
lo be told is how he justifies 
the loss ot an exceptional 
instructor.

oul a growl that shakes the 
raders. 

What do you do to fill the 
void'' If you are like many 
students at IPFW, you are on 
a light budget and cannot 
afford the food served at the 
campus cafeteria every day. 
Yet, you don't want lo leave 
campus and lose your 
parking space :which is like 
gold around here). How do 
you solve your dilemma? 

Members of The Com- 
municator staff set oul to 
determine whether the food 
served in campus vending 
machines is a viable 
alternative to what the 
cafeleria offere. Both Ihe 
vending machines and The 
Fort are operated by Can- 
ieen Corporation. the 
loodservice company under 



current contract with IPFW 

Armed with SIO in quar- 
ters, staff members led an 
attack on the cellophane 
wrapped food m the 
voluminous machines of 
Walb Memorial Union 
Building and Ketllcr Holl 

What they discovered is. 
like at any other eaLng 
establishment, there are 
very good selections along 
with other that no human 
being should take intentally. 

For a mere 90 cents, a 
machine in Walb will spit out 
an egg salad sandwich that 
in actuality is only two small 
pieces of bread with very 
little rilling. The egg salad 
carriedwithita greenish tint 
and a heavy mustard taste. 
The coloring hopefully came 
from the pickles mixed in the 
egg salad. Besides, for 90 
cents do you really expect 
the kind that mom makes? 

The next item sampled 
was appropriately called a 
"poor boy." This specialty is 
madeof different varieties of 
meat and cheese. The first 
bite indicated the meat and 
cheese did not come from the 
best market in town as it was 



hard to distinguish the two 
from each other. The only 
taste remaining with you is 
that of bread — very dry 
bread. The sandwich could 
not even be softened with 
mayonnaise because con- 
diments are not available at 
the food machines in Walb 
after the cafeteria closes at 2 
p.m. The result is a filling 
yet bland sandwich that sells 
for SI 10. 

Over in Kettler Hall, such 
delectable delights as beef, 
bacon and cheese sand- 
wiches, pizza, croissant and 
chicken salad sandwiches, 
chopped beef steak plates, 
hot dogs, vegetables and 
tuna casseroles can be 
purchased. 

Wilhjaieft, alolof tasUng 
went on in the basement 
lounge in Keltter on Monday 
afternooa 

The pizza, at SI. 40 for 
about a six-inch piece, 
looked excellent while 
frozen. Once it hit (he 
microwave, though, hidden 
pockets of grease popped up 
and literally poured over the 
edge of Ihe deep dish. It was 
reminiscent of the pizzas you

might find on sale at the 
grocery store marked "two 
for 79 cents " The Italian 
sausage was probably the 
best part of the whole thing 

— if you could wade through 
Ihe tomato sauce to find it. A 
suggestion to those with 
stomachs sensitive to 
grease: forego this expense. 
You would probably rather 
go hungry. Thank goodness 
for the thick layers of dough 

— it became spongy as it 
absorbed the grease. 

Probably the best food we 
found was rather fattening: 
blueberry pie that lasted 
surprisingly fresh. This 
selection came cellophane 
wrapped and placed on a 
tray — along with three 
packets of mustard! We 
chose not lo use the con- 
diments and at the pie itself. 
The dessert was full of thick 
blueberry filling and lots of 
berries. The crust was very 
flaky and overall, a good 
value for only a buck. 

The next thing chosen was 
the Beef. Bacon and Cheese 
sandwich on a hoagie bun tor

to have a fleshy quality to it, 
It was hard to cut because of 
the high gristle content. The

to the sandwich by using the 
mustard given with the pie. 
This helped tremendously. 
The bright pink "bacon" 
turned oul to be someihing 
similar to bacon bits dropped 
sparingly over the meat and 
what little shredded cheese 
there was. 

However, our entrees were 
not all bad. Canteen redeems 
itself with the Chopped Beef 
steak Plate. The entree sold 
for Sl-80, complete with 
one-fourth pound chopped 
beef, a dollop of mushrooms 
and gravy, mashed potatoes 
and corn. The steak did, 
twwever, have a distinct 
peppery taste to it. while the 
potatoes were a bit too salty 
and coarse. One suggestion 
for Canteen You have a 
basically good meal here, 
but it should Iw served in a 
deeper dish. When the food 
was put into the microwave, 
the gravy and potatoes ran 
over into the corn, creating 
one large mess. 

On tVie fighter side is the 
croissant with chicken. This 
should be renamed the 
celery-onion croissant 
sandwich because of the 
taste of onions and celery 
overpowers the chunks of 
chicken. For $1.40, the best 



thing about this deal is (tw 
fresh croissant. 

A couple other dessert 
specialties were also tested. 
The Bamby vanilla pastry 
(55 cents) was a vanilla cake 
topped with icing and toasted 
coconut. Although the 
packaging said "Sell by 2- 
12." the cake was very dry 
and (he majority of the 
coconut was falling off the 
icing. Its expiration date 
should have long been ex- 

Aunl Fanny's sells an 
arliricially flavored cream- 
fiUed cake for 55 cents. 
Although the cake had no 
icing, it was very moist and 
had a good chocolate taste. 

Finally, another good 
choice Canteen made was to 
offer liolh Coca Cola and 
Pepsi products (o wash it all 
down. Even (he most finicky 
drinkers can l&gt;e pleased. 

Overall, (he packaged food 
passes as an alternative to 
students on a budget. If you 
are really hungry, jusi have 
a dollar or two to your name 
al the time and can't make it 
over to (he cafeteria before it 
closes, go ahead and try the 
food, II won't kill you. Our 
staff members survived the 
assignment.

LeBlanc featured in faculty exhibit 

Visual fables used as form a personal inspiration 



By JUDY RAMSEY 
StatfWrUer 

"Reynard. A Day in Ihc 
Life" is the Iheme for tfiis 
year's Faculty Art Exhibit 
featuring mixed media 
artworks by AnnMarie 
LeBlanc The exhibit will 
open Friday. Feb. 6 with a 
reception from 7 p.m. to 9 
p.m. at the Fine Arts 
Auditorium located at 1026 
West Berry Street 

Faculty members who 
have been on sabbatical or 
\\a\e a new body of work lo 
show are chosen for the 
annual Faculty Art Exhibit 
explained Kathy Hettinga, 
exhibition coordmalor for 
the fine arts deparlmenl 
Hellinga fell LeBlanc's art 
exhibit "really looks ex- 
cilmg." 



LeBlanc is originally from 
Baton Rouge. Louisiana. She 
graduated from Louisiana 
State University with a 
Bachelor of Fine Arts degree 
and earned a Master of An 
degree from Purdue 
University in West 
Lafayette. LeBlanc had 
instructed classes m art at 
ihe University of Michigan 
and Purdue University 
twforc accepting the position 
of assistant professor of tine 
arts with Indiana University 
last August 

She has conducted 
numerous workshops and a 



dem 



for 



versities located in 
Michigan, Indiana, Ohio. 
Tennessee and Kentucky 
Her works of art liave been 
displayed in several solo and 



group exhibitions shown in 
Louisiana, Indiana, Illinois, 
Kentucky. Kansas. Ohio and 
Florida . 

The following is a 
statement prepared by 
LeBlanc pertaining to her 
artwork displayed at the 
Faculty Art Exhibit ; "My 
mixed media works are 
narrative settings housing a 
distinct breed of humanity 
embodied in animal form. 
The environments are 
simply layers of interior and 
exterior stage props. The 
figures, or performers, 
inhabiting them are both 
real and fictional. A kinship 
is formed between the 
figures and environment in 
both style and sentiment. 

Fables are a source of 



per- 



inspir 



providing a narrative 
structure to embody my 
observations on human 
relationships. My works are 
simply visual fables, and 
they are autobiographical in 
nature. The animal forms, 
as in their literary eoun- 
lerparis, personify both 
positive and negative human 
characteristics. They lake 



part in imaginary and 
private dialogues. 

Happily ever after belongs 
lo the fairy tale; God t)etongs 
to the parable. My fables are 
amoral and unredemptive. 
They capture the essence of 
a situation rather than the 
facts. Never losing their hold 
on the real world, these 
fables take their inspiration 



Although the majority of 
these works were completed 
within the last four months, 
a couple of pieces date tiack 
to as late as 1985. They are 
composed of acrylic paint. 
soft pastel, colored pencil 
and graphite. At limes, 
objects are silk screened or 
collaged onto the final 



layer" 

The Faculty Art Exhibit 
will feature LeBlanc's mixed 
media artwork from Feb. 6 
through Feb. 28. The art 
pieces can t)o viewed 
Mondays and Wednesdays 
from 9 a.m. lo 5 p.m., and 
Tuesdays, Thursdays and 
Fridays from 12 p.m. to i

Tlatoon' helps understand veterans of Vietnam 



By GINA JONES 
Managing Edilur 

Vietnam: The war that 
was played on our televisions 
M home in the 60's and early 
TO's lias finally found a 
realistic moving portrayal 
on the big screen: 
PLATOON. 

For many of the IPFW 
student body, Vietnam is a 
vague memory or something 
we hear our parents or older 
siblings discuss. For a select 



tew It's as fresh as if we had 
just received draft notices. It 
is very important for those 
with little recall to learn the 
faclsof Vietnam PLATOON 
helps achieve this. 

You say you've seen the 
movies of 'Nam 
Apocolypse Now. Un- 
common Valor, Rambo. But, 
you haven't seen the war. 
Now, with 'Platoon,'' you'll 
realistically experience 

There is an important 



reason to see ■Platoon "The 
veterans of Vietnam are still 
fighting the war in their 



ninds.

members missing in action 
or prisoners of war are still 
living m the shadow of 'Nam. 
In seeing "Platoon" you may 
finally understand the 
nation's preoccupation with 
the war and the tears that 
have been shed. 

As you walk into the door 
of Glenbrook theater the first 
thing you see are posters of 
Vietnam. The Vet Center of 
Fort Wayne has left packets 
of information to help 
veterans realize they are not 
atone in their struggle. There 
is a bumper slicker on one of 
the posters proclaiming, 



Review 



'We owe it lo each other to 
stand by each other " The 
Vet Center has posted a sign 
stalmg that if you need to 
talk to someone after seeing 
Ihe movie, a 2-1-hour coun- 
seling hotline is available. 



This all sets the stage for 
the experience you are about 
to have. Nothing can prepare 
you for what is about to lake 
place. 

"Platoon" is a very well 
acted movie. Charlie Sheen 
plays a young volunteer, 
Chris Taylor Tom Barenger 
plays Sgl, Barnes, the bad- 
guy in the American ranks. 
William Dafoe plays Elias. 
Each are deserving of an 
academy nomination for 
their respective roles. 

The emotions that 
"Platoon" evokes are dif- 
Ticult. at best, to describe. 
When leaving the theater you 
will feel like you have been to 
Vietnam. The director's goal 
has twen very successful in 
this respect. It was his in- 
tention for viewers lo have a 
better understanding of the 
Veterans of Vietnam, 
Leaving the movie, I felt 
immense respect lor these 

Prior to the movie the 
usual sounds of whispers and 
restlessness were not 
present. The theater was so 
quiet the silence was almost

lot of people coming 
lo the movie alone, as if it 
were lo personal to share 
with anyone. 

Michael B Kellermeyer, a 
Vietnam veteran of the 25th 
Division, located on the 
Cambodian border, shared 
Ws feelings on the film: 
"Platoon was very realistic, 
I enjoyed the movie, because 
I could watch it without 
having flashbacks. I also 
enjoyed the movie t)ecause 
people could actually see 
how we lived in the bush 
everyday. We never knew 
when we were going to be 
hit. Leaches, ants, snakes, 
they were alt portrayed 
realistically. It was our life. 
Wfien people used to ask me 
what Nam was about I 
couldn't explain it. Now 
maybe after seeing the 
movie, they can understand. 
That movie was only two 
flours long. We lived under 
those conditions 24 hours a 
day. for the whole year that 
we were there, 

"I'm proud of being in 
'Nam, I always have tieen. I 
welled up at the posters in 
the foyer of the theater. The 
movie was a story, but it was 

'^Z- noi Cn n li-fe. 
f syiV-e/rta 



everyone's story. The fire 
fights were the same, the 
Americans screaming in 
pain. 

"Our main concern in 
Vietnam was not upholding 
democracy Our main 
concern was lo remain alive. 
We were 19, 20-year-old kids 
We wanted lo get out of 
there. We never fought 
between ourselves, like 
depicted in the movie. The 
underlying message of Ihe 
show was true. The rains, the 
heal, the leaches, malaria, 
dealh. That was our 
everyday lite. We seriously 
respected the enemy, II was 
like walking through a jungle 
of horrors asa teenager! The 
Vietnamese could think of 
mean terrible ways to kill 
someone Gore was an 
everyday thing — a dead 
body became common 
company You could sit next 
to one and eat." 

"The war is over now but il 
will always be there with me 
all the days of my life," said 
the character Chris Taylor 
al Ihe end of the movie And 
so will Platoon — it is an 
experience that will never be 
forgotten.

Talented VoIIeydons make national impact 



By JENNY BLAKI-EV 
Staff Writer 

They have acquired quite 
B (ollowing in Ihe past 
several years Their 
nickname is "VoIIeydons." 
and (hey excite the crowds 
that witness Iheir matches. 
They are a group of guys 
who comprise the IPFW 
men's volleyball lenm. 

Most of (he players &lt; all bul 
two) are from oul of slate A 
majority of these athletes 
did not start their college 
careers at IPFW, or right 
out of high school. "My 
brother and I contacted 
different schools (to pla y 
volleylull). and no other 
Sdiool's offer compared to 
the offer here."' freshman 
Tim Heffron said. Heffron 
10ol( a five year breaii from 
school, beginning college 
this year. Sophomore Jay 
Goldsleyn spent a year out of 
school. "I fell a need to go to 
college, and volleyball was a 
way to help me out finan- 
cially, "he said. 

Several of the players 
transferred from other 
schools, including 

sophomore Dan Springob, 
from Ihe University of 
Wisconsin, and senior Ted 
Owen, from TriState 
Volleyball, obviously, is a 
major attraction for the 
athletes, IPFW being one o( 
the few Midwestern schools, 
along with Ball Slate and 
Ohio State, offering a varsity 
volleyball team. 

The team goes through two 
hour^ of practice five days a 
week. This consists of 
running and jumping drills. 
and various other practices, 
such as passing, setting and 
spiking. The practice hours, 
coupled with school, can 
present a slight time 
dilemma. "Practice and 
classes are both very 
demanding," junior Phil 
Bodine says. "When you're 
tired after practice, it's hard 
to go home, do homework 
and comprehend every- 
thing." 

The Mastodons have 
several "road trips," 
traveling to other schools for 
matches. Many of these are 
during the week, which could 
present a problem with 
classes and homework. 
However, freshman Sieve 



Sowa slates, "You can make 
lime to do all of the things 
Ihatyouwanttodo." 

Heffron adds, "Sometimes 
it's hard when you have to 
miss classes. For the Penn 
State tournament (January 
24-25), I hadtomissa couple 
of classes." 

Owen and Springob, 
hailing from different 
schools, state that the IPFW 
athletic program compares 
favorably to their previous 
respective colleges. "I! (the 
athletic program) is pretty 
comparable (to Tri 
Stale's)," Owen says, 

II is a different at- 
mosphere at IPFW, 
however. "Going to IPFVl 
and Wisconsin, you see the 
two' extremes." Springob 
said. "(Wisconsin) is a large 
campus, with 45,000 
students," 

The Mastodons receive a 
very positive response from 
the fans. "The community 
support is great." Springob 

"Ball Slate and Ohio State 
have a lot of people on 
campus, and we don't, bul 
we still get people to come 
back and walch Ihe games," 
Owen says. 

Bodine adds, "We have 
some of Ihe best (fan sup- 
port) around," 

Notwithstanding the 
number of volleyball en- 
thusiasts viewing Ihe con- 
tests presently, Ihe team 
offers suggestions for 
recruiting even more people 
to the matches Heffron 
suggests, "We need more 
advertising and promotions 
in conjunction with 
volleyball Ifor instance, a 
coniiert after a game). Also, 
we could put on some 
exhibition games at high 

Bodine states, "We need 
more TV and newspaper 
coverage," while Springob 
sees radio ads as a 
possibility. "We should 
advertise on FM stations. " 

"If we play well againsl 
lough learns, people will 
hear about us more, and see 
the gomes — that's the best 
promotion." Owen said. 

When asked about their 
proudest moments, the 
athletes offered a variety of 
responses Several pertain to

the victories in this season's

says, Heffron adds, "When I

Owen feels proud to have 
"been able to play volleyball 
and keep a good G.P.A.; 
also, being the MVP in the

Sowa, Springob and 
Goldsleyn add their 
"moments of glory" in 
volleyball. Sowa states. 
"Representing ihe Army in 
Ihe European Cham- 
pionships held in Frankfort. 
Germany in 1985" was his 
proudest lime. Springob and 
Goldsleyn competed in the 
National Sports Festival. 
Springob on the gold-medal 
winning South team, and 
Goldsleyn on the North 
team, which won the silver 
medal. 

The Mastodons have high 
Gupectations for the future. 
"Volleyball is going to lx)om 



one of these days," Heffron 
says, "Fort Wayne is one of 
the firsi places because of 
the size of the town (it's big 
enoughfor it to happen). ' 

"I think our team has the 
potential to make national 
TV," Goldsleyn comments. 

Springob sums up, "We 
certainly could make the 
nnatfour." 

The next contest for the 
Mastodons is Friday. Feb. 6

Fun Run builds endurance 




By GINA JONES 
Managing Editor 

"Through rain, sleet, or 
snow" ... sounds like the ad 
lor the U.S. Postal Service? 
Well it is also an accurate 
descripUon for the IPFW 
cross country team. It may 
not be the season, but it is 
always lime for a little cross 
country. 

On Saturday mornings at 9 
am . Coach Kast and 10-12 
brave souls hit Uie turf for a 
"fun run," Enthusiasm has 
caused the runners to 
schedule addilional runs on 
Tuesday and Thursday 
nighlsatep.m. 

Who's a "fun run" tor It 
is for absolutely anyone 
interested in improving 
cardiovascular muscles, and 
keeping fit. It is not just for 
cross country runners. You 
are free fo run anywhere 
from 12-14 miles (which the 



team does), or 3-4 miles, or 
less. It depends on the in- 
dividual runner how far you 
go- 

Fun-Runners meet at the 
multi-purpose building. The 
course is usually a run on the 
green-way, cily utilities 
parko and down to the art 
school on Berry Street and 
then iMck. Again, you can 
turn around whenever you 
want, and you go your own 
pace. II all depends on what 
you feel you can do. On 
Tuesday's and Thursdays 
Ihe speed is a Illtle faster 
than on Saturdays. 

"Everyone cheers 
everyone on I'm trying to 
make cross country a fun 
sport. I'm not a Bobby 
Knight lype coach. I want 
sports to be an enjoyable 
activity," stales Coach Mike 
Kast 

One of Ihe activities on the 



Sobering 

Advice 
can savi 

a life 




agenda, to help make cross 
country an enjoyable sport. 
Is the Indoor Track Meet at 
Bloomington, Feb. 13. Coach 
Kast is planning on taking 
runners to the meet 
"Anyone who wants lo go 
down is welcome. I need to 
sign people up by Ihe 9th. 
This meet is open lo all 
runners," said Kast. 

IPFW does not currently 
have a track team. The 
money for one is not in the 
sports department budget. 
"If there was enough in- 
terest I'm sure we could get 
something started," said 
Kast. 

"My outlciok for next year 
is that we will have a strong 
team. The guys have im- 
proved tremendously. We 
need 5 girls to fill a women's 
cross country team. The 
women only have to run 3 
miles, and we travel to the 
meets together. It is a lot of 
fun. Age doesn't matter. You 
only have to be a full-time 
student." says Coach Kast. 

Additional men runners 
are always welcome also. If 
anyone is interested in 
brushing off their running 
shoes, and giving cross 
country a try. contact Coach 
Kast through the athletic 
department, or join him for a 
fun run. If you would like lo 
attend the Bloomington 
indoor track meet, stop in 
the athletic department 
office, and leave a message 
for Coach Kast.
