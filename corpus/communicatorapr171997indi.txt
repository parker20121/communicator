Just north of Classroom- 
Medical Building is a large mud 
hole in the ground which was first 
dug in the middle of February as 
part of the new science building 
project. 

"The ugliness you see oui 
there," said Don Katlcr, director of 
physical plant, "is pan of the Total 
Telecommunications Replacement 
Project." 

The entire project includes the 
creation of a new telephone switch 
room, replacement of the 10-ycar- 
old telephone switch board, installa- 
tion of a new fiber backbone and the 
in stall aii on of a communication duct 
bank. The total costs come to $2 
million. 

The installation of the communi- 
cation duct bank alODe totals 
5218,000. And this is the observable 
disruption north of Classroom-

stretch from the east side of Hclmkc 
Library and run west to the physical 
plant. From here, the duct bank 
leads south to (he science building 
project still under construction. 

"This gives us an underground 
patb to pull telephone cables, fiber 
optic cables and coax cables to 
(he science building from 
Hclmke," said Kattcr. 

"The new building has tele- 
phone, data and video needs also," 
said Kaiter. 

The Learning Resource Center 
located in the basement of Helmkc 
serves as the distribution center for 
video and data. Here is where the 
main server is situated, therefore. 
the telephone lines must be con- 
nected to Hclmke. 

"It is just empty tubes and a ter- 
rible mud hole right now," said 
Kattcr. 

Morehead Electric Company is 
to start pulling the lines through (his 
week. There should be no more

Banquet and formal prove to be successful 




by Lisa Zinn 
Features Editor 

Ncaring the end of the semester, Students Activities 
Board (SAB) held IPFW's first Spring Formal, in con- 
junction with the annual Greek Banquet. 

This event, held at The Lantern, was open to all of 
campus. The evening began with a chicken dinnet includ- 
ing vegetables, potatoes, a roll and a salad. 

Following dinner. Greek Council held their awards 
ceremony Jennifer Edwards, President of Greek Council. 
announced the winners of the awards. Kevin OrUiman, 
vice president: Beth McConnell. treasurer and Jay 
Benjamin Cucllar. secretary were awarded for their ser- 
vice throughout the year. Others were thanked for their 
participation in the Greek system. 

"Doctor Feelgood's" took over after the awards and 
spun tunes throughout the evening Members from all 
groups including SAB, Pi Beta Phi, Delta Gamma, Phi 
Kappa Theta, Sigma Phi Epsilon and others were on the 
dance floor during the night. Refreshments were available 
which added a certain excite- _ .. „ _ 

ment to the evening for some. 




beloved "Macarena" and 
"Electric Slide" but the disc

Everyone had great fun showing 
off their dance moves or simply 
enjoying the songs from the 
sidelines. However, almost 
everyone made it to the dance 
floor at least once throughout 
the night. 

Overall the evening was a 

success and it may become an 

annual event The fees that the 

social fraternities and social 

sororities put forth go into a

So what's all the buzz about last 
weekend's opening of "In the 
Company of Men" al the Cinema 
Center? We already know that it 
was shot entirely in Fort Wayne, its 
director was a former IPFW profes- 
sor, a few of the key players were 
also from IPFW and ours is the first 
city to receive a showing, up to six 
months before anyone else. You'd 
think we were in New York or some- 
thing Apart from all these things, 
what is the attraction? 

Well, whatever the attraction 
may be. it is definitely strong 
because every showing has sold out 
since the opening and lines of poten- 
tial Cinema Center patrons have 
been turned away 

I el me put it this way, there is 
no happy ending, no big stars, it had 
a low budget and a no-name direc- 
tor The draw of the film is its real- 
ism. The filmmaker did not attach a 
rose-tinted filter over bis cameras. 
The plot did not move along happily 
like a well-oiled machine Like real 
life, it has twists and turns that are 
not anticipated by the viewers. The 
film's attraction is its use of real sit- 
uations, real dialogues, and real 
ideas that occur between two col- 
lege buddies turned "friendly" com- 
petitors on their way up the corpo- 
rate ladder. 

The movie opens with the two 
men swapping stones about bow 
women have done them wrong. 
Instead of just leaving the topic with 
a "better luck next time" comment, 
one of them devises a plan to get 
revenge on all women by devastat- 
ing the emotional well-being of one 
And so it begins. 

But while you may think that the 
movie is only centered on men tak- 
ing out their angst on women, there 
are other topics touched upon as 
well. The two men have a silent

conflict of their own and although 
tbey seem to be on good terms, there 
is an underlying, competitive edge 
to their relationship One man is 
chosen over the other for a supervi- 
sory position on a project. He 
quickly and mysteriously loses this 
position due to an error, and the 
audience is left to wonder whether 
revenge once again played a pan in 
the sudden change. 

The women in the movie are 
lied to, but in turn, they also lie. 
People tell lies, but in this film, 
everyone seems to get caught. It 
just shows viewers how common- 
place lying really is. The players in 
this film demonstrate how easy 
lying can be. It can sometimes 
almost be a spon. a challenge to 
keep the lie going. We have all been 
there and so we understand the per- 
verted agenda Tbe movie is 
about power. Power over women. 
Power over co-workers. Power over 
men. It is also about a psychologi- 
cal "King of the Hill" game between 
rivals, between sexes, between 
lovers and between races, all related 
by a man who starts a game of 
power and emotions just because 
"he can." 



The film's plot may seem harsh 
and cruel, but I enjoyed every 
minute of it. From the raw and 
somewhat quirky-sounding, original 
theme song that blares intermittent- 
ly, to the cruel, slap -in- the -face end- 
ing. Of course the familiar locales 
add their own flavor to the film's 
personality. Al some points, they 
even add some humor as exhibited 
at a Cindy's Diner scene involving 
the criticism of the beloved eatery. 

The attraction of the film is the 
reality of how people deal with each 
other Whether we realize it our not 
there is a little bit of "Company" in 
all of us. We all play mind games 
and we all lie. Let's face it We've 
been polishing these skills since we 
were kids. These false testi- 
monies seem to challenge us and 
allow us 10 rise above our so- 
called rivals We all experience 
feelings of jealousy, rivalry and 
revenge and deal with them in 
brutal, unattractive ways. Ways 
which are fngbleningly similar to 
the tactics used in the film by the 
characters whom we grow to 
despise. The film is about us and 
although it might not be for every- 
one, it should be

Opera equals entertainment 



by Amanda L. McAhee 
Staff Writer 

For those students oui there that 
have been to an opera, don'i knock 
Last Friday and Saturday night, the 
School of Fine and Performing Arts 
and Department of Music performed 
Henry's Purcell's opera "Dido and 
Aeneas " It is the story of the Queen 
of Carthage, Dido and the Trojan 
war hero, Aeneas, and their passion- 
ate love story. The opera was sung in 
English and performed by all IPFW 
students. 

The performances by all were 
wonderful. I was amazingly sur- 
prised. With the opera being trans- 
lated into English. I though it would 
lose some of its meaning. For some. 
it was still a little hard to understand 



The first act was spent with 
Belinda. Dido's sister, and the sec- 
ond lady trying to convince Dido to 
declare her love for Aeneas. 
Saturdays performances by Holly 
Parks as Dido. Kelly Kellen as 
Belinda and Mackenzie M. 
Ardhuerumly as the second lady 
were terrific. These three young 
woman did a great job in portraying 
their parts. During the whole act. 
their facial expressions always 
showed great emotion and they were 
truly convincing. 

The second act, scene one, gave 
a kind of comic twist with a sorcer- 
ess and her witches plotting the 
downfall of Dido and Carthage 
They create a spirit to remind 
Aeneas of his duty to Italy. The first 
and second witches, performed by 



Janel Johnson and Christy Kanka on 
Saturday night, brought some comic 
relief to the show. They spent the 
scene cowering from the sorceress, 
Bridget Bannec. and doing little 
dances here and there. 

In scene two. the royal lovers 
and their companions are out pic- 
nicking, when the witches conjure 
up a storm forcing Lhem to take 
shelter. This is where the spirit 
comes in and convinces Aeneas to 
leave and go to Italy Aeneas does 
not realize that it is a trick. The 
spirit, played by Daniel Boms. 
was a small but convincing role. 
He had a wild look of being awak- 
ened after a long nap and was 
great in keeping with the story. 

The third and final act. the 
audience sees Aeneas' sailors getting 



ready for voyage and the sorceress 
and her witches celebrating his 
departure. Dido now knows that 
Aeneas is leaving and is visibly 
upset. Aeneas, portrayed by 
Christopher Rasor on Saturday, 
and Dido, by now have created a 
very real feeling of what it is like 
to be so passionately in love and 
have it turn into a tragedy. Once 
Aeneas leaves. Dido takes her life 
in despair. Parks did a wonderful 
job convincing the audience of her 
great grief over Aeneas. The char- 
acter subsequently kills herself 
with her own hands. 

Overall, the show was a suc- 
cess The orchestra played won- 
derfully, and the IPFW University 
Singers did a good job of setting 
the mood during certain scenes 



Musical exhibits odd-ball humor 



Do you really trust 

Many a relentless night, 

Someday I might. 

Try to stop the fight, 

Searching for the brightly glowing light. 

I confuse myself, 

I place you on a shelf. 

You are as precious as a tiny elf. 

Can one trust one's self? 

Living in such sin. 

Maybe one day I'll win. 

Let us do it again, 

I've screwed up, can we do it again? 



-Jay Benjamin Cuellar 



The program warns the audience 
from the start, "Please note: This 
production contains adult situations 
and adult language." Nevertheless, 
nothing will prepare them for the 
two hours of terrific songs and 
"laugh out loud" humor. 

Last weekend, the School of 
Fine and Performing Arts theatre 
production, "The World Goes 
Round: The Songs of Kander and 
Ebb." opened at the Williams 
Theatre. The show was a review of 
songs written by John Kander and 
Fred Ebb whose films include 
"Cabaret," "New York, New York" 
and "Kramer vs. Kramer." 

The show was directed and 
choreographed by Larry Life, direc- 
tor of the theatre department. 

The characters of the show were 
full of emotions. They took each 
song and crafted it to form a small 
musical in itself Whether is it was 



the humorous "Coffee in a 
Cardboard Cup" or "Kiss of Spider 
Woman," each song struck the audi- 
ence. 

Overall, the production was a 
night of laughter. "The World Goes 
Round" company was diverse and 
absolutely hilarious. They tried 
everything from dancing in under- 
wear to shouting obscenities in an 
attempt to capture the audience's 
attention. Amazingly enough, it 
worked. 

I have never seen so much grab- 
bing of breasts and crotches in my 
life. Yet, for this cast, it was a must. 
These characters were not your typi- 
cal guys and gals next door. 

Their wardrobe fit the 
well. The men all wore leather, to 
further establish their "oddball" 
characteristics. The women were 
dressed in anything from glittery 
attire to a Liza Minelh wardrobe, 
especially actress Jane Reoekah 
Frazier 

However, this was not a musical 



full of fancy sets and magnificent 
costumes. Acting was the key to the 
production. Numbers like "Class" 
were excellent simply because of the 
acting and physical movements. The 
song discusses how people no longer 
have "class." Men no longer treat 
correctly; people simply 
have lost their 

Strong voices brought the stage 
to life. Actress Natalie Jones went 
from song to song, belling out 
of die best tunes of the night. On the 
other hand, the men seemed to over- 
power the women in this one. Actors 
John Strachan and Todd Frymicr 
the highlights. These men sang 
without flaw. 

While the slow songs like 
"Cabaret" and "Marry Me" were nice 
and fanciful, it was the light-hearted 
songs like "Sara Lee" that attracted 
my deepest attention. Who ever 
thought a Sara Lee cake could be so 
entertaining? Audiences will also 
enjoy the hell-bent "How Lucky Can 
You Get?." "Arthur in the 



Afternoon" and "Razzle Dazzle." 

Plus, die night would not have 
been nearly as fun without the pres- 
or Edgardo Ortiz. This dancer 
went beyond the act of seduction. 
Throughout the night, he did the 
splits, placed a long blond wig upon 
and danced around in bis 
underwear. He refused the let the 
audience lose their in it 

Overall, the night was unique 
and memorable However, the 
turnout could have been better. 
Nearly half the seats were empty. 

So, if students want a night of 
raunchy, inventive humor, check out 
"The World Goes Round" next week, 
this week are tonight, 
tomorrow and Saturday at 8 p.m. and 
Sunday at 2 pm.

Unethical educators 
taint teaching profession 



"II was the stress and pressure 
(o succeed " Ahh, the widely used 
excuse among most children 
when asked why they cheated. 
While stress and pressure to suc- 
ceed is commonplace in schools 
among students, students are not 
the only ones who feel this pres- 
sure. Teachers and administrators 
have heen caugbt cheating. 

Several schools throughout 
the U.S. have reported thai teach-

the students' educational success. 
Students are not getting what 
they need out of school — an 
education 

The students at Stratford 
(whose parents no doubt pay high 
prices lo improve their children's 
chances of getting into The Ivy 
Leagues) have been cheated and 
scammed, thereby causing them 
to look like failures in the eyes of 



guilty of changing students' test other school children who attend 
scores. By making test scores less prestigious schools In fact, 



higher, schools 
think they will

school funds.

ly is guilty of erasing wrong 
answers and replacing them with 
right ones. 

The principal denied the 
charges, yet be made a deal with 
the school board and retired. 

Why would any school offi- 
cial do this? Could it be that the 
pressure to succeed and surpass 
(heir peers (meaning other 
schools) is thai real for schools? 
For Stratford it was. Their stan- 
dardized lest scores — after being 
altered — were 40 percent higher

istrators and teachers is too great

They are not only cheating 
"on behalf or' their students; they

At the simplest level, they are 
teaching studenls "what not to 
do." At a more serious and com- 
plicated level ihey have quite 
possibly stained the confidence 
and trust of children who inno- 
cently fell victim lo the school's 
larger agenda. 

We are aware that while 
Stratford is not an exception, it is 
an example of other schools 
where "pressure lo produce" is 
loo great and causes unethical 
behavior ii did for Stratford. 

li should be noied ibat 
Stratford is not representative of 
all schools and teachers. On the 
contrary, most schools continue 
to teach children what to do, not 
what not to do Children admire 
their teachers. Teachers are lead- 
ers for studenls in many respects 
and should act in like manner

Letters to the Editor 



Capital punishment is hypocritical 



To the editor: 

In response to the April 3 staff editorial on 
capital punishmenl. I would like to commend 
those who brought this shocking truth to light. 
People today do not see the hypocrisy of iheir 
ways. 

Today we are loo busy with revenge and 
making criminals pay for iheir horrible 
crimes. Do nol gel me wrong. These people 
deserve to be punished, but who are we lo 
judge? The younger generation is being sent 
the message lhal il is alright to murder as long 
as the government is Ihe party responsible. As 
the article stales, humane or not, il is still 
clearly murder. And murder is always wrong. 

la response lo people who justify cap- 
ital punishment with the eye for an eye 
verse, let me just enlighien the minds of 
those who know. 

Matthew 5:38-42 reads: 

"You hove heard that if was said 'Eye 



for eye, and tooth for tooth. ' But I tell 
you, Do not resist an evil person. If 
someone strikes you on the right cheek, 
turn to him the other also. And if some- 
one wants to sue you and take your 
tunic, let him have your cloak as well. 
If someone forces you to go one mile, 
go with him two. Give to the one who 
asks you, and do not turn away from the 
one who wants to borrow from you," 

So, in all actuality, the Bible does not 
teach revenge or even ihe literal meaning of an 
eye for an eye. 

I do not mean to bring religion into this, 
bui for ihose who wrongfully use the Bible lo 
support their convictions of capital punish- 
ment, this is for you. 

The Bible does tell of instances when 
death was used as a penalty by the government 
of biblical times. Mosi are moral crimes such 
as prostitution, rape, stealing, adultery, pre- 
marital affairs, and still others. 



So before any of you condemn the "hard" 
criminals with capital punishment, why not 
judge yourselves. I am sure when the time 
comes, not only will the criminals be judged 
by God, but also all of us for our "crimes'' of 
morality. 

Matthew 7:1-2 reads: 

"Do not judge, or you too will be 
judged. For in the same way you judge 
others, you will be judged, and with the 

measure you use, it will be measured to 



One final note to the ones who twist the 
verses of the Bible, my suggestion to you is to 
first read the Bible, then reread ihe Bible to 
understand what Ihe message is before show- 
ing your hypoensy, not lo mention your igno- 
rance.

IPSGA election board defends actions 



To the editor: 

In the recent issue of The Communicator 
there was an article on "IPSGA candidales ana- 
lyze their campaigns." This anicle contained a 
false statement made by Gina Burgess that I 
would like to clear up 

As chairperson of the Election Board for 
the 1997 elections, I was surprised to see that 
the election board had made a ruling in her 
favor concerning anonymous allegations made 
to the election board. It is true that anonymous 
allegations had been made against Burgess' 
campaign, and we were investigating it, 

" would not have been doing my job if I 
had noi called for an investigation. What is 



false about Senator Burgess' comment is the 
part about the ruling. The fact is that no rul- 
ing was made and there is no certainty that 
any ruling would have been made the way 
she predicted. 

Senator Burgess was under investigation 
for many violations of the campaign and elec- 
tion rules. Decisions and disciplinary action 
were noi decided on because Ihe election board 
could noi find a lime to meet before, or during 
the week of elections. We were all much loo 
busy wilh other things. 1 am very disappointed 
in Senator Burgess; however. I am not shocked 
at her behavior. 

Senator Burgess has been very hostile and 
disrespectful towards me and the election 



board Irom the first time I had Informed her of 
a violation. She argued with me several limes 
about decisions that had been made by the 
election board in ihe hopes (I believe) of 
changing our minds. When the election board 
or I would not allow Burgess to influence the 
decisions of the election board, she and her 
husband became intimidating. 

This is not meant as an attack, and I will 
probably be accused of conducting a witch 
hunt. That is not whal this is. It is a presenta- 
tion of the facts and I only wanted to clear up 
the issues that were falsely presented.

Guest Column: Barbara Graf 



Heaven's Gate people had it all wrong 

What did they believe anyway? We know they Being raised Catholic (and suffering through four 

believed that there was a spaceship behind years of Catholic school) I always thought that Christ 



the Halc-Bopp comet that would take them 
to the "Level Above Human," or the "Kingdom of 

Heaven " 

The belief of this group was that two thousand years 
ago, members of the Kingdom Heaven, who are respon- 
sible for "nurturing" gardens, deter- 
mined lhal a percentage of die human 
plants of Ihe present civilization of this 



garden (Earth), was developed enough 
so that some of those bodies might be 
used as "containers" for soul deposits. 

Upon insiruc lion, a member of Ihe 
Kingdom of Heaven ihen left his body 
in that Next Level, came lo Earth and 
moved into (or incamaied into) an 
adult human body (or vehicle) that had 
been prtpped for this particular task. 

The body lhal was chosen was 
called Jesus The member of ihe 
Kingdom of Heaven who was instruct- 
ed lo incarnate into that body did so at 
His "Father's" (or Older members) 
instruction. He "moved into" (or took 
over) thai body when he was 29 or 30 
years old. 

When 1 learned of this I found it a 
little hard to believe I mean, we're all 
allowed to believe in what we warn lo believe, but I find 
it kind of hard to swallow that Jesus Christ who was 
bom lo the Virgin Mother, was actually incamaied into 
a human body. This goes against what the Catholic reli- 
gion teaches and what I believe every religion teaches 
about the birth and resurrecuon of Christ 



had died for our sins. According lo Heaven's Gale, Jesus 

was incarnated into a body and then said lhal the only 

people who could get into the Kingdom of Heaven 

where (hose who received a "deposit" containing a 

soul's beginning which had the capacity to believe or 

recognize the Kingdom of Heaven's 

representative Those who had such 

"deposit" could only gel in by having 

total reliance on him 

What this "religion" (as they called 
it) was. is a cult thai had a twisted ver- 
sion of God and Christ The truth is 
thai anyone can get into Heaven and 
the only real judge is the Ultimate 
Judge -- God. 

The main fact of life is lhat we have 
souls before we are bom. We live the 
allotted amount of umc God allows, 
and then our souls are taken to Heaven, 
where ihey are judged by God. God is 
the only Judge on this earth God is the 
one who decides whether we go to 
Heaven or Hell, (and yes. I do believe 
there is a Hell) 
The fact of the mailer is thai these 

, , , people wen: crazy I'm not saying that 

they shouldn't have believed in what 
they believed in — just thai the average person does not 
believe that you can enter Heaven by catching a nde on 
a spaceship 

The story of dying in the Catholic religion is that 
when you do, your body is buried, bul your spirit goes 
on to heaven and is judged by God. 



"What this 'religion' 
(as they called it) 
was, is a cult that had 
a twisted version of 
God and Christ. The 
truth is that anyone 
can get into Heaven 

and the only real 

judge is the Ultimate 

Judge- God."

'Pursuit of money' versus 'pursuit of knowledge'

that the pursuit of money is impor- 
tant to a vast number of people. 
Now, before anyone thinks I'm 
going to criticize people who do like 
to attain the monetary rewards that 
life has lo offer, think again 

The major response to capital- 
ist-type economies, socialism, does-

dose of light. 

Socialist ideals can be appreci- 
ated; but the bottom line is that the 
absolute power given lo a govern- 
ment under socialism wdl corrupt 
those in charge. Remember "Gulf 
War Syndrome," the general term 
given to the ailments that afflicted 
veterans who were fighting overseas 
at the time? Chemical weapons were 
suspected of being used by Iraqi 
forces during that war. Well, low 
and behold, the pentagon just hap- 
pened to "lose" any records contain- 
ing information about the use of 
chemical and biological weapons. 

Conspiracy theories aside, does 



anyone really want more of this type 
of government "assistance" in their 
lives? Besides, like it or not, money 
can be a sound incentive for people 
to "push the envelope" in develop- 
ing better services and inventions 
aimed at advancing the public good 
Do government-enforced programs 
that profess the same goals come 
even close to equalizing the quality 
that our country experiences? 

However, at the other end of the 
spectrum, maybe we would do well 
to slightly lessen the image of the 
importance of money, especially to 
our impressionable young folks 
Money will buy nice things, don't 



get me wrong But, at the risk of 
sounding cliche, it won't buy happi- 
ness, love, family, friends, or peace 

Is Dennis Rodman happy? Or 
has he been so corrupted by the pur- 
suit of fame and fortune that he can't 
possibly even realize that his deca- 
dent lifestyle has become a "model" 
to many impressionable children'' 

To relate a personal anecdote; 
before 1 started taking classes at 
IPFW, I seriously considered attend- 
ing Ivy Tech to attain a degree in a 
technical field. The whole idea was 
to have a way to earn more money 
the quickest way possible. With no 
disrespect meant to students or fac- 



ulty at Ivy Tech, I chose a liberal arts 
education at IPFW as my goal. 

Why? Because, although money 
and the security it brings are very 
attractive. I wanted an education 
that made it possible for me to find 
out more about myself To find out 
more about the world I live in. To 
seek other viewpoints and philoso- 
phies on life To boldly go where no 
well, you get the idea. All of tins 
is helping me to attain happiness as 
quick as possible, not money. While 
1 may live frugally for a good, long 
time and 1 may not have all (he 
materiaTlhings that I thought I want- 
ed as a child. I hope to use knowl- 



edge to procure riches for which 
no currency could ever be 
exchanged 

Perhaps Proverbs 13:17 articu- 
lated it better: "There is that 
maketb himself rich, yet hath 
nothing; there is that maketh him- 
self poor, yet hath great riches." 

So what's a person to do? On 
one band, we live in an economy 
where having money can be criti- 
cal to survival; on the other hand, 
the pursuit of money at any cost 
can create social and environmen- 
tal problems that are difficult to 
reverse 

I guess all anybody can do is lo 
try and provide for themselves and 
their loved ones the best they can. 
while not destroying or taking 
away others' possessions or digni- 
ty at the same time (are you listen- 
ing, big companies wbo exploit 
cheap labor in Third World coun- 
ties?) In the meantime. I'll settle 
for the pursuit of knowledge as a 
method to fill my spiritual coffers, 
because, for my money. Bill Gates 
has nothing on King Solomon. 



Rite of passage: Jason PesetsKi 



Officer receives harsh punishment for discounted Pizza 



In the April 10 
issue of the 
Journal Gazeue, 
Ibe paper ran a 
story concerning 
a city police offi- 
cer who was sus- 
pended because 
be purchased 
pizzas at a dis- 
counted price 
from Pizza Hut. The officer was 
suspended for five days without 
pay. Apparently officers can only 
accept ihe discounted pizza while 
on duty and in uniform. This dis- 
count is offered in return for the 
presence of police in private estab- 




lishments such as Pizza Hut This 
is fairly common among such busi- 
nesses as gas stations and conve- 
nience stores. 

Okay folks. I have a few ques- 
tions lo throw out at you dealing 
with this circumstance First, whai 
is the only profession next to the 
armed forces that is willing to risk 
their lives on a daily basis to pro- 
tect and serve the public against 
potentially dangerous people? You 
guessed it, law enforcement. 

Secondly, if you walked into 
your local pizza place and ordered 
a $10 pizza and got it for $5 would 
you complain about it and tell 
them you couldn't accept it? 



Especially if they were telling you 
it was because your profession (in 
general) does such a good job? 
Probably not. 

Thirdly, how would you feel if 
your boss, from whatever job you 
worked, told you that you were 
going to be suspended for the pur- 
chase of those very same pizzas? 

Before everybody starts to get 
up in arms about this article, let me 
clarify a few points. I realize that 
law enforcement agents are 
already getting paid for their work 
on the job, but do you know how 
much they get paid for it? Not very 
much if it is a local law enforce- 
ment agency. If you ask most 



police officers why they joined. 
they will tell you it was not for the 
money. Furthermore, a situation 
(such as offering a discount) could 
be utilized in an unethical manner 
by those less scrupulous people 
working in such the field. 

However, in my opinion, if I 
ran a business in the food industry, 
1 would be more than grateful if a 
few police officers stopped in — 
on or off duty. Security is security 
and those people are sworn to 
uphold the law. 

The officer in question, as the 
article later stated, bad been hon- 
ored for several apprehensions and 
interventions while off duty. I fail 



to see why a five-day suspension is 
in order for something as menial as 
a discount that was offered, not 
asked. We read and hear so many 
negative comments about law 
enforcement that it seems that arc 
larger problems in the police 
department that should be dealt 
with rather than this case. 

In all fairness. 1 must add that 
the article stated that this was not 
the first disciplinary action taken 
against the officer in question The 
officer has been disciplined eight 
tunes in the last two years, but 
none of these have been public 
complaints. They have stemmed 
from things such as not servicing 



his squad car after 3,000 miles and 
failing lo obtain proper notifica- 
tion for a sick day. 

Hey, I think we have all 
probably forgot to change our 
oil or called in sick when we just 
didn't feel like going to work 

In conclusion, I would like 
lo praise Pizza Hut for getting 
involved with efforts to reward 
those who protect us and I 
would like to say that I feel a 
five-day suspension is improper 
for the infraction committed 

By the way, the officer 
was in uniform at the lime — 
he jusi finished working a 
security detail.

Whitaker robbed in rumble 

Communicator staff member viewed fight first hand 



Nol 
Beckley 




From the opening bell to ihe 
final cries o( "Bullshit" and "Fix." I 
witnessed an oven movement lo 
belter market boxing to a younger 
audience at the Pemell Whitaker v. 
Oscar De La Hoya bout in Las 
Vegas last Saturday. 

I saw a fight where a younger, 
more marketable fighter (De La 
Hoya) clearly did noi beat the 
cocky, elusive champion 
(Whitaker), but was given the deci- 
sion solely on the basis of his 
charismatic persona. De La Hoya is 
a great fighter, but he did not dom- 
inate the battle enough to win a 
decision over a champion he could 
hardly hit. 

I was raised with the belief that 
to be the champion, you bad to beat 
the bell out of the old one. You 
should knock him out to be sure 
But nothing of the sort happened in 
the Thomas and Mack Center 
(borne of the UNLV Runnin' 
Rebels) in Vegas. There was a cer- 
tain bit of irony that on the home 
court of the one of the most corrupt 
basketball programs in the country- 



was the site of 
one the biggest 
fixes in recent 
boxing history. 
How can 
you win a 
major title 
when you can- 
not seem lo hit 
the champion? 
Whitaker made 
De La Hoya 
look foolish by 
forcing him to 
miss punch 
after punch 
round after 
round The crowd, being biased for 
De La Hoya, saw all these as signs 
of De La Hoya dominaling 
Whitaker They roared for each 
miss, near miss and glancing blow 
De La Hoya almost landed. The 
frenzy must have infected the 
judges, because their scorecards 
bad De La Hoya ahead by seven or 
eight points even though De La 
Hoya fell lo the canvas In the 
ninth round. 

In reality. De La Hoya slipped, 
but the referee called it a knock- 
down Whitaker just happened to 
throw a punch at the right time to 
catch the Golden Boy off-balance 
It counted and it should have on the 
judge's cards. But apparently it did- 
n't and De La Hoya won With this 
win. De La Hoya is assured of at 
least one more huge payday wiih 
Whitaker, a few more endorse- 
ments lo cash in on and another belt 
lo bang around his waist, 

I admire both fighters and I 
need to make that clear because I'm 
afraid I'm sounding like I hate De 
La Hoya. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. I just felt he was 
awarded the title without beating 



ihe champion decisively. De La 
Hoya is a fine fighter and one day 
he will have the skills (o beat 
Whitaker. but on Saturday he was 
taken advantage of by an older, 
more experienced veteran. 

I enjoyed the figbt and was 
taken away by the sheer magnitude 
of ihe pageantry for this fight I had 
never seen a huge prize figbt in per- 
son before. I've seen huge events 
like the Final Four and 
WrestleMania, but nothing can 
compare lo seeing a title boul in 
"Sin City." Vegas is a monument 
to all the vices which we love -- 
gambling, drinking, strippers 
and prostitutes. 

Part of the reason I'm writing 
this column is to brag and boast 
about getting tickets to an event 
where I could rub elbows with 
Cuba Gooding Jr. Robert Shapiro, 
Larry King, Bruce Willis, Hector 
"Macho" Camacbo, Evander 
Holyfield and Mike Tyson. I heard 
Michael Buffer announce "Let's get 
ready to RRRRRRRRUMBLLLL- 
LLLLLLLE!!!!!!!!!." 

Huey Lewis and the News, who 
were also playing Caesar's Palace, 
sang the national anthem De La 
Hoya brought a Mariachi Band to 
entertain bis legions of Latino fans 
who drove for hours to scream, 
cheer and support the Golden Boy 

The other part of my reason for 
choosing this topic is because what 
more could I say about Tiger 
Woods than everyone else has 
already said Unfortunately for the 
rest of the world, golf may become 
a staple of television like football 
If it does I only hope I'm tired 
enough to (all asleep before the 
first tee shot. Golf is a game to play, 
but it can be dangerous. There are 
murderers out there. Just ask O.J. 



Volleydons face familiar foe 



by Scott Warden 
Sports Editor 

II was almost inevitable that 
IPFW and Lewis would meet in the 
semifinal round of the men's 
Midwestern Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association Tournament. 

The teams split their two previ- 
ous meetings, with Lewis taking the 
first match in three games 15-5, 15- 
9 and 15-12. That match was all the 
way back in February, and the Flyers 
held IPFW to a measly .202 hitting 
percentage 

On April 5, the Volleydons got 
their revenge - taking Lewis in five 
games 15-17, 15-13, 15-4, 9-15 and 
17-15, The Dons hit a whopping 42 
percent in ihe match. 

Friday night ihe two will meet 
for the rubber match at Ihe 
Memorial Coliseum 

The Volleydons reached tbe 
semifinal round after cruising by the 
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee 
15-5, 15-7and 15-8 The 'Dons were 
led Justin Luna, a junior swing hit- 
ter, who nailed 18 kills. 

Luna, who usually comes off of 
the bench (or the Dons, entered the 
starting lineup after sophomore 
Javier Escobar hurl his knee in the 
match against Lewis. 

"Justin Luna played a greai 
match," said sophomore middle bit- 
ter Ryan PerroUc "He's just been 
spectacular off of the bench the past 
couple of weeks He came in and 
played great defensively in ihe win 



over Long Beach State. Then be 
came in against Lewis and did a 
tremendous job. Tonight he got the 
start because of Javier's injury and 
filled in superbly He's just the super 
sub." 

Even though IPFW didn'i get 
much of a challenge from the 
Panthers, coach Amie Ball wasn't 
looking forward to the matchup. 

"I don't like playing quarterfinal 
matches," Ball said. "Especially 
wben we've beaten them twice in the 
regular season. Obviously they 
come in with absolutely nothing to 
lose and we have everything to lose. 
And, I was obviously concerned that 
Javier wasn't going to be able to 
play, but Justin really picked up the 
pace and really did a good job, so it's 
nice lo have thai kind of depth and 
have somebody come off of ihe 
bench wbo hasn't really gotten to 
play much and really made a big dif- 
ference in the match " 

In the first game against 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, IPFW held 
an 11-0 lead, but slipped as they 
gave (he Panthers a window lo climb 
back into the game. 

"I think that it was evident in 
this match that we sort of let down 
our guard," said Perroue 



"Especially halfway through the 
first game We were up big. but then 
we lost our concentration and 
weren't doing the tbmgs that got us 
to that p. mil TheD we struggled in 
tbe second game We just came out 
flat and lackadaisical in some areas, 
but I think that the guys know (bat 
this upcoming weekend is going to 
be the weekend that if we lose focus 
or lose concentration for just a split 
second, a team like Lewis, or a team 
like Ball Stale or Ohio State will just 
take advantage of that." 

Tbe Dons are going into Friday 
night's match with both confidence 
and momentum IPFW has won five 
matches in a row, including wins 
over Lewis and Long Beach State. 

"We're playing well," Perroue 
said. "We're on a winning streak and 
during those matches, we've been 
playing really good volleyball 
Going into Friday night's match. 
we're confident and hopefully we'll 
be able to push through." 

If the Dons upset Lewis on 
Friday, they will take on the winner 
of the Ball State - Ohio State to 
determine who will represent the 
MJVA in the 1997 NCAA Volleyball 
Championships which will be held 
in Columbus. Ohio, May 1-3

1 tbougbt that I was doing all 
right with my life I'm not going to 

so far as to say that I'm an 
extremely successful person, but for 
being only a handful of days before 
I turn 20, and being my arrogant 
self, Id have to say that I'm above 
average as far as success is mea- 
sured by our generation 

But tbe standard of excellence 
has risen. 

Enier the golden boy — Tiger 
Woods. 

I do know one thing. If I bear 
ome little golf-club-toting brat 
itter the words, "I am Tiger 
Woods," one more lime, I'm going 
to shoot myself — but only after I 
shoot tbe TV, the head of Nike and I 
might even go after Tiger himself. 

1 probably shouldn't take any 
pot shots at one of the most loved 
and universal figures not only in 
sports, but in the world. You might 
say that I'm jusi being jealous 
Damn right. 

What we often forget, is that 
ibis young man is only 21, A week 
ago. be began his run at the Masters 
and by the second day he was lead- 
ing the field. But he couldn't stop 
there, could he? Oh, no. He had to 
go and break nearly every damn 
record at Augusta National. 

Let's count them off for those 
sheltered souls He beat some guy 
named Jack Nicklaus' 32-year-old 
record for lowest 72-hole score 
(270) as well as his record for the 



most under 
par on the 
back nine, the 
most threes on 
a winner's 
card and 
rounds better 
than the field. 

And still we forget that this 
guy's 21. 

Under different circumstances, 
he could be the guy sitting next to 
me in my political science class 
He'd probably just show me up in 
the class room as well, but that's not 
so hard to do If he didn'i lum pro. 
he would be getting ready to take 
bis finals and close out his junior 
year at Stanford. 



I might be a little insecure, but 
when one of my peers is the best in 
the world ai something, I just have 
to wonder, "Where did I go wrong?" 

But thinking about it, 1 would- 
n't trade my life for his. He has to 
get up every morning and play gotf 
What a rough life. 

1 even feel sorry for the poor 
boy What docs he have left to do 
with his career'. 1 He's won the 
biggest tournament in golf in his 
first year and shattered the record 
book in doing so. 

I think that everyone sees the 
path that he's heading down We've 
all heard ihe stories about child 
actors who turn out to be bad seeds 
and end up robbing convenience 
stores. 

So soon more than just TV 
watchers will be doused with that 
annoying phrase. 

It will be in a little different 
context than in some glamorous ad 
for Nike There aren't many people 
watching bun at his AA meetings. 

"I am Tiger Woods... 

"...and I'm an alcoholic."

Tennis team rolls into conference tourney 




Sophomore Matt Flory concentrates on his slice backhand 



by Scott Warden 
Sports Editor 



With a conference record of only 
4-6. IPFW's men's tennis team might 
have been struggling through the 
regular season, but after a 5-4 upset 
win over Taylor University in their 
final match of the regular season on 
Monday, the 'Dons nave picked up 
some momentum going into this 
weekend's Great Lakes Valley 
Conference Tournament 

Tennis coach J Webb Horton 
knows thai if his players have one 
thing going for them, it's their heart 
He also knows that when the collec- 
tive heart of the team stops beating, 
they're dead. 

The Dons showed both their 
coach and Taylor that they weren't 
about to roll over and play dead any- 
time soon. 

The match was tied with only the 
No. 4 singles contest left to be decid- 
ed, but junior Darrin Strayer came 
back from one set down to lake his 
maich 5-7, 6-3 and 6-4, giving IPFW 
ihe victory. 



Also getting wins in singles were 
No. 1 Rob Moreland. who won easi- 
ly 6-3 and 6-1 No. 2 Jason Garriotie, 
who also came back from losing the 
first sel and was down 4-0 in the sec- 
ond-set be breaker won 3-6. 7-6 and 
6-1. Matt Flory won in the No. 3 slot 
6-2 and 6-3. 

"Taylor is an excellent team," 
said Horton. "This was an excellent 
way for us to step out of the regular 
season and move into the tourna- 
ment It's just a great confidence 
booster for us, but it's only good if 
we build on it and lake ihe momen- 
tum thai this win has given us into 
the tournament this weekend" 

Most likely IPFW will only 
carry a seventh seed into the GLVC 
tournament bul Horton knows thai 
his team can make up for a mediocre 
performance through most of the 
season by shinning during the tour- 
ney. 

"We've struggled throughout the 
year." Horton said, "but my whole 
philosophy is thai it doesn'i make 
any difference what your record is 
going into the tournament You can 



be undefeated after the regular sea- 
son, but if you lose in the first round, 
you're going to consider it a disap- 
pointing season lis ihe same way if 
you didn't do as well as you would 
have expected at the beginning of the 
year, because if you win the tour- 
nament, it turns out not to be such 
a bad season. 

"I know ih.ii we're better than 
our record shows, but now it's 
time to show everyone else that 
we're better." 

Horton said that for the 'Dons to 
be successful this weekend, (hey 
need to win wilh their top two dou- 
bles teams right off of the bat, but the 
determining factor will be the perfor- 
mance of Josh St John and Phil 
Patterson, the No 5 and 6 players 
respectively. 

"Those two guys are really inex- 
perienced," Horton said "I can't fmd 
any fault with their play, but they just 
haven't played enough college 
matches, but they are definitely 
learning. My hope is that this week- 
end they can really come of age. I 
think that they can step it up and play 
really big for us. They've been in — 
and lost — a lot of close matches this 
season, but they've been in that sit- 
uation enough that I ihink that 
they'll be able to close some out 
this weekend." 

Horton knows that between the 
team's win on Monday and the 
beginning of die tournament tomor- 
row his player's fundamentals aren'l 
going to change in a few practices, 
but he knows that the intangibles 
will be a big factor in determining 
the success throughout the tourna- 
ment. 

"I think that we — as six guys — 
have to come together and play as a 
team," Horton said. "Right now, 
some people are playing really well 
for us and some are not but it's con- 
tagious when you win and it's conta- 
gious when you see someone else 
stroking the ball well. And you're at 
the conference tournament so the 
energy will be there. 

"If you can't get up for the 
GLVC tournament - check your 
pulse." 

Because if the heart slops - the 
team's dead.
