FDA requests consumer input 



ByEARLSMITH 
Chief Reporter 

The Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) wants to know how consumers 
feel about package labeling. On 
Thursday evening, Nov. 14, people 
voiced their opinions at the consumer 
exchange meeting held in the Walb 
Memorial Union ballroom. Others 
asked questions without making 
statements. 

The meeting, attended by about 40 
people, was hosted by Edwina Snyder, 
assistant professor in the consumer and 
family sciences department, and 
conducted by two FDA officials. 

The opinions expressed at the 
meeting will be transmitted to 
Washington and will be introduced 
during House and Senate hearings in 
January or February. 

In his opening remarks, Allen L 
Hoeling, district officer, gave a short 
history of consumer exchange 
meetings. With the advent of the con- 
sumer movement, the FDA felt a need 
to obtain more opinions from the 
general citizenry rather than just 
professionals. "I have always had some 
doubts whether the Ralph Naders 
really represent the consumer," 
Hoeting said. 

The issue generating the most 
comment and emotion was the issue of 
food content labeling, which surfaced 
during discussion of fat labeling U.S. 
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum D- 
Ohio) has introduced Senate Bill 1699 
which would require more detailed 
Information on fat. oil and cholesterol 
content. 

Attorney Fred Beckman, president 
of the Northeast Indiana Chapter of the 
Human Ecology Action League, said 
the FDA should require more in- 
formative labeling on products which 
have been irradiated. "Although it 
(irradiation) is intended as a preser- 
vative, irradiation actually has been

labeling at an FDA consumer exchange meeting held m

Mark New). 



shown to increase the rate of spoilage in 
some cases," said Beckman. 

Many Americans need to closely 
monitor their consumption of fats and 
oils. Current labeling makes it im- 
possible to determine whether the oil in 
a product is saturated, monosatu rated, 
or polyunsaturated, said Beckman. 
"Labels also need to state the total fat 
content and the specific kind of fat — 
cottonseed oil, palm oil, corn oil," said 
Beckman 

The consumer cost involved makes it 
impractical to change labeling 
requirements. "Increasing the in' 
formation on packaging is not useful 
since the average consumer doesn't 



know what a milligram of cholesterol 
is," said Bob Harper, a food labeling 
specialist. Companies should list on 
their packages the names of persons to 
contact for more detailed information, 
said Harper. 

' The issue of self -diagnostic product 
labeling was introduced by Lyn 
Goossens, public information officer, 
who said instructions vary widely from 
brand to brand and the results can be 
invalidated by weather conditions or 
inattention to timing. One person spoke 
on this topic; Wayne Stutzman said 
these products should have one set of 
instructions for laymen and another set 
for medical professionals 



The third subject on which the FDA 
asked for opinions was health messages 
on food packages. Although there was 
no comment on this issue, Hoeting said 
the Kellogg Company"s competitors 
feel it was misleading. Foods fit the 
definition of drugs when they are 
promoted to improve health, said 

I Hoeting 

. "We are prepared to favorably 
consider ways by which food labeling 
might be used as a means of conveying 
health messages, so long as our ability 
to regulate health fraud is not 
diminished or compromised," said 
Hoeting. 



Validity of SAT score increase questioned 



By DEBORAH A- ST ARKS 
Chief Reporter 

A dramatic increase in Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores has been reported 
by the National Education Association. 

"The increase in the Scholastic Aptitude Test scores is testimony that America's 
teachers, kindergarten through high school, have been doing an excellent job in the 
classroom," said Mary Hatwood Futrell, National Education Association 
President. 

SAT scores, until last year, had been on a decline for nearly 20 years. The 
combined total of 907 in 1985 places the SAT average back where it was 10 years 
ago. More than a million high school students take the test each year. 

"The SAT is a perfectly accurate test," said Professor Michael Downs, chair- 
man of the political science department at IPFW. "However, it is less important 
and less an indicator of success. It does not measure things like desire, interest and 
determination, which are more important in individual cases," said Downs. 

"Students' records are the number one thing a school looks at in determining 
how well a student will do in his or her first year in college," said John Walmsley, 
supervisor of Testing and Physiological Services for Fort Wayne Community 
Schools. 

"Making greater progress will depend in part on the nation's ability to make 
higher education more accessible," said Futrell. 



According to the College Board, fewer black students ore going to college; the 
total is down some 2.000 from a year ago, primarily because of federal cuts in 
college loans and elementary and secondary remedial programs. 

"All studies show the higher the income level of the family of the student taking 
theSAT, the higher the test score," said Walmsley. 

"The SAT is culturally biased," said Downs. A good test would measure 
something other than what this one does, 

"The SAT is written by people whoare products of that kind of test," said Downs. 

The National Assessment of EducaUonal Progress report showed the 1985 
students who contributed to the record SAT increase are the same students who 
have been showing steady improvements on tests by the NAEP 

"While middle class students whose parents are educated do better on stan- 
dardized tests than do students from low economic standards,' ' said Downs. 

"The Socio-Economic factor in the SAT is not just one factor. It is how well a 
person can think or reason, his experiences, and what a family can reinforce 
within a student," said Walmsley. . measurement of 

-The SAT will not be changed much or eliminated as a measurement ol 
achievement," said Downs. 

"However, with good teaching, good entry level counseling in college, and good 
programs, students will do well," Downs. 



Senate votes on symposium at weekly meeting 



ByEARLSMITH 

Chief Reporter 

Student Senators had their work cut 
out at their Nov. 13 meeting. 

Senate voted on several items related 
to the upcoming legislature breakfast 
and symposium and did some brain- 
storming in regard to goals for the 
school year. 

Student Body President Joseph 
Motherwell appointed Philip Downs 
parliamentarian. "I have talked to him 
at length and found him to be very 
knowledgeable in parliamentary 
procedure," said Motherwell. This 
appointment was approved by the 
senate. Last week at the Nov. 6 
meeting, Student Senate approved the 
appointment of Sheri Kaltenmark, an 
Indiana University student here at 
B?FW, as a clerk for the senate. 

In other business, the student senate: 

1. Discussed bill 8586* in- 
troduced by Student Senator Pat 
Patrick which would enable 
alumni to use library typewriters 
if they are active members of the 
Purdue or Indiana University 
Alumni Clubs. 

2. The senate was informed by 
Student Senator Jill Adamson the 
Student Senate will take part in 
the Komet Merchant Night 
Saturday, Dec. 14. Students may 
purchase tickets to the Komet- 
Peoria game at half-price ($3) at 
the Sweet Shoppe on the first 



floor of Walb Memorial Union 
building. This opportunity to buy 
the tickets to the Komet game 
Dec. 14 at half-price was 
provided by the Student Senate 
when they bought a block of 100 
tickets for that game. "It is a 



fantastic opportunity to see a 
hockey game at half-price," said 
Adamson. "We hope students will 
take advantage of this offer so 

other organizations will give us 
this chance to help make events 
like this affordable to students." 



The Student Senate will not have a 
regular meeting on Wednesday, Nov. 
27, due to the Thanksgiving holiday. 
The senate will reconvene on the 
Wednesday following Thanksgiving, 
Dec. 4. 



Association recommends standards 



By CAROL KOENIG 

Staff Writer 

The National Education Association 
has a goal to put an excellent teacher In 
every classroom. To achieve this goal, 
high standards must be set for those 
entering the teaching profession. NEA 
has recommended some steps to take to 
ensure the professional competence of 
our teachers. 

Four basic preconditions were 
outlined in a recent NEA publication. 

First, teacher education programs 
should set rigorous standards for ad- 
mission. These would include main- 
taining a 2.5 grade point average, 
completing at least one academic 
major, passing a test measuring 
competency in reading, writing, math 
and at least one academic major, and 
submitting recommendations from 
teachers. 

Second, teacher education students 
should master the professional skills 
and apply them in increasingly more, 
demanding student- teaching situations. 



Third, teaching candidates who 
successfully complete a teacher 
education program should serve a 
three-year internship under the 
direction of an experienced teacher. 

Fourth, professional teachers should 
be continually evaluated and given the 
opportunity for continued education. 

IPFW is meeting some of these 
standards "We have the same shared 
goal with NEA," said Marjorie Souers, 
chairperson of the Division of 
Education. "We would like to see ex- 
cellent teachers in all classrooms." As 
new standards are proposed, they are 
automatically referred to a faculty 
committee for evaluation, 

IPFW has, in some cases, taken the 
lead in setting rigorous standards for 
its teacher education students, ac- 
cording to Souers. For example, field 
experience was practiced here long 
before it was mandated by the state 

State legislation, which was effective 
July 1, requires prospective teachers to 
pass a battery of tests to become cer- 



tified. The exams test general 
knowledge, professional knowledge, 
communication skills and areas 
specific to the student's major. The new 
law also requires teachers to renew 
their license every five years. There 
will be no more lifetime licenses. 

IPFW standards require education 
majors to have an overall GPA of 2.5. 
Student teaching at IPFW is a struc- 
tured program which starts with ob- 
servations, advances to one-on-one and 
small group teaching experiences, and 
finishes when the student teacher has 
responsibility for a class all day under 
the close supervision of an experienced 
teacher. 

Professional competence is vital to 
the strength of our education system. It 
is a concern of parents, students and 
the general public Acting Chancellor 
Edward Nicholson shares this concern. 
He has reviewed the recommended 
NEA standards and concludes, "There 
are some dramatic changes, but we 
support them and intend to comply."

What? They actually sell 
textbooks at Folletfs! 



Walk in the door at Folletfs bookstore 
and what do you see? Textbooks?. ..No. 

The first thing you will probably set 
your sight on is a newspaper stand, 
greeting cards, calculators, magazines, 
posters, tee-shirts, jackets. .and, finally, 
the textbooks pop into sight, way in the 
back of the store. 

The primary purpose of the bookstore 
is to sell books, textbooks. However, it 
probably takes longer to order a 
textbook, considering the store usually 
doesn't order enough, than it does to 
special order a shirt or a particular 
entertainment product — the latest 
Danielle Steel novel or a particular 
university jacket. 

Ask any professor what one of the 
greatest banes of his existence is — 
especially around the first week of 
classes. He is bound to say "Follet's!" 
with a severe tone of voice. Other 
professors can be heard saying "Good 
bookstore. ..they forgot their main 
purpose here is to sell textbooks to 
students." 

We feel the same way. The campus 
bookstore is not the place for the 
pornographic material to be sold The 
1PFW bookstore is not comparable to the 
Indiana University bookstore. This 
campus, like you have heard many, 
many times before, is a commuter 
campus. Probably a good majority of 
people pass a Keltch's or a Walgreen's 
two or three limes a day. Unless you 
have a class in Kettler hall, you do not 
necessarily have to walk down there. 
The point is. for IPFW students, the 
opportunity to buy these magazines and 
posters is offered by the drug stores in 
town. There is not a serious need for 



Folletfs to sell "Playboy." "Playgirl," 
"Penthouse." *'Oui," and other 
magazines of this type to the student 
population. 

Of course. Folletfs makes money on 
this. There is no question some people 
would be more attracted to the literature 
in these sources than a textbook. 
However, this could perhaps be a good 
selling point when trying to buy these 
magazines from the publishers. Can't 
you hear it now? "Oh yes, Ms. Hefner, 
we have several students who don't like 
to study, and they go into our store 
because they are attracted to your 
quality literature and imaginative 
photography." That says a lot for the 
image of IPFW students. 

Come on folks. Aren't you forgetting 
your function on campus 9 Forget the 
pornographic materials. They are not 
needed on our campus. 

Although we do not approve of the 
bookstore selling pornographic 
material, we are not condoning any type 
of censorship. We would not approve of a 
student resolution banning the sale of 
this material. They could suggest they 
do not approve of the sale of this 
material in a resolution, however. 

The decision to forego selling this 
material — including magazines, books 
and posters — should be made by the 
management of Folletfs. In turn, the 
management of Folletfs should have the 
best interests of the students in mind, 
rather than how wide they can make 
their profit margin. Hopefully, they will 
realize their main purpose is to serve the 
educational needs of the students — not 
to encourage outside pleasures.

Respectfully, 

Brad Miller 

Student Body Vice-President 

It's Miller time 

To the Editor: 
Get ready IPFW: On 

Monday. Nov. 2S, your 
Students' Government will 
host a legislative breakfast 
between 8 and 10 a.m. The 
gala affair has been billed as 
a "Breakfast and Sym- 
posium — Improving Higher 
Education in the Face of 
New Federalism." Catchy 
title, right'' What die name 
of the program does not 
describe is what the break- 
fast will really be: "The 
Brad Miller Hour - DPFW's 



stand-out, machiavellion 
politician!" (Student Body 
Vice President). 

After reading about Mr. 
Miller's power- seeking 
exploits in last week's 
Communicator, it comes as 
no surprise to learn that Mr. 
Miller has manipulated the 
commendable idea of in- 
viting area legislators to 
IPFW to interact with 
students and faculty into a 
personal political coup. I am 
told by Students' Govern- 
ment members that Vice- 
President Miller has: 

1.1 Personally designed 
the program's invitation list 
and agenda. This includes a ! 
speech by Mr Miller, but 
excludes any other Students' 
Government representative 
the opportunity to speak. 

2.) Although we have 
university clergy. Miller 
hand-picked the pastor of his 
own church to open the 
breakfast in prayer. 

3.) Miller has concealed 
his self-glorifying agenda 
from Senate until "popping" 
it on them at the last meeting 
(after it was loo late to 
change any plansi. 

All is not lost -at the last 
meeting. Student Senate and 
President Joe Motherwell 
forcefully suggested and 

1 Early public advertising 
of the breakfast 

(newspapers, flyers, etc.). 

2) Inviting the heads of all 
the student organizations to 
the breakfast (Vice- 
President Miller was quoted 
as saying "We have to be 
careful with how many 
students we invite at S4 a 
head." 

3.1 Dropping a speaker 
from the agenda so as to 
allow student and faculty 
interaction with state 
representatives. Funny 
thing, Senator Coats' new 
office intern Brad Miller 
provided Coats with the 
opportunity to demonstrate 
his concern for higher 
education in Indiana. New 
office intern ... hmmm — 
'atta boy Brad — one hand 
washes the other, right?!). 

Kind of ticks you off 



doesn't it? Never the less, we 
as students must realize just 
as Student Senate seems to 
be aware of, that although 
the Nov. 25 legislative break- 
fast is largely self-serving 
with respect to Student Body 
Vice President Brad Miller, 
an important second step is 
being made. After a similar 
kind of event last year, 
perhaps the idea of 
politicians responding to 
student- voiced concerns will 
become institutionalized at 
IPFW on an annual or 
semester basis. 

As for now, remember lo 
mark Mortday morning, Nov. 
25 on your calendar. As for 
Mr Miller — we will ap- 
preciate his efforts to coerce 
state representatives to our 
campus, but shouldn't the 
legislative affair have been a 
result of planning of Student 
Senate as a whole, not of one 
individual? IPFW student- 
activity fees are not to be 
used as a marketing slush 
fund to promote any one 
individual's political career.

In response to the letter 
appearing in the Nov. 14 
issue of The Communicator 
entitled "Miller Unfair." 
may I point out that the

been effectively reformed, 
through efforts of Vice 
President Miller and senate, 
to include a plurality of our 
student body. 

Students' Government has 
survived each passing year 
without the aid and 
protective regulations of a 
formal office policy. The 
demands or our current 
situation call for a policy 
which encourages student 
organizations' formal use of 
meeting rooms, protects the 
security of our phone system 
and assures respectful use of 
Students' Government office 
equipment In order to 



develop a workable policy, 
all viewpoints involved need 
to be considered. The 

bership has just that same 
thought in mind. Through 
their synergistic efforts of 
reasonable compromise, we 
will propose such a solution 
for student senate approval. 
Although an office policy is 
not an earth-shattering 
issue, such a policy is in 
effect a statement of attitude 
toward the student body. Our 
ideal attitude is that the 



leparation betw 



the 



sludenl government and the 
student body be tf on-existent 
Students' Government 
welcomes the input of any 
student on this issue or any 
other Many channels of 
communication are open to 
students there are seats 
available on SUBOG, 
through direct com- 
munication with Students' 



Gov&lt; 



lent offic 



representatives, or through 
public comment via "The 
Communicator." 

Not only does the Students' 
Government welcome your 
input, but your involvement 
as well. We are currently 
involved in group projects 
which include the Fine Art 
Building issue, redevelop- 
ment of the student discount, 
formal statement on the 
issue of Apartheid, increased 
campus security, bookstore 
and luition costs, a sculling 
event, HPER class rein- 
statement, a campus 
swimming pool, new 
cafeteria hours, vacation 
trips and guest lectures and 
many others. We welcome 
any age, part- or full-time, 
male or female students 
from any ethnic race or 
special interest groups. Our 
goal is to include any faction 
of the student body in our 
decision-making process. 

Thank you for your per- 
sonal time, your in- 
volvement, and your concern 
for our university and its 
students.

the symposium will address 
the needs of college students 
as the federal government 
changes its role in funding 
college expenses, James

the School of Public and 
Environmental Affairs, and 
Sam Rey of the Indiana

"Students will get an idea

ment is doing in regard to the 
issue of federalism," said 
Brad Miller, student body 
vice-president. 

Prior to the symposium 
will be a breakfast to which 
approximately 200 people 
have been invited, said 
Miller Those invited include 
the state legislators from the 
thirteen counties in North-

formal this year has not been

The purpose of the break- 
fast and symposium is to 
communicate the needs of 
the student body, said Miller. 
"It's probably our biggest

he said.

PIT's 'Fool for Love' 
simulate indoor-rodeo effect

News Bureau 

"Fool (or Love," a four- 
character play by Sam 
Shepard, will mark the 
Purdue Indiana Theatre 
directorial debut of Joel K. 
Murray, instructor In 
theatre. 

Murray, who is an actor 
and playwright as well as 
director, said he chose "Fool 
for Love" because "this is 
what speaks to me 1 think 
educational theatre has to 
try various kinds of things. 
We're seeing more and more 
contemporary plays in 
university and regional 
theatres. It's exciting that 
theatres are showcasing 
Ihese playwrights." Shepard 
also is an actor who was seen 
in the recent films of "The 
Right Stuff" and "Country." 

Although "Fool for Love" 
contains many elements 
common to other of 
Shepard's plays — the set- 
ling in the Southwestern 
U.S., raw emotion displayed 
at an intense pitch — Murray 
said it is noteworthy because 
it marks a departure from 
his explorations of family 
relationships, such as the 
two brothers in "True 
mination of 



a male-female love 

relationship. Murray 
directed "True West" at 
Bowling Green State 
University, where he is 
completing his doctoral 
dissertation. 

The play requires actors 
who are as rough and ready 
as the characters they 
portray. The full-length play 
is presented in one act 
without an intermission, and 
it requires actors who are 
physically as well as 
emotionally resourceful. Bill 
Harp, an IPFW alumnus and 
veteran PIT performer, is 
providing gymnastic and 
combat coaching for the 
production. 

"We're going (or a sort of 
indoor-rodeo effect," 
Murray said. "I told the cast, 
■you will have bumps and 
bruises.' I've got (the actors 
playing) May and Eddie 
lifting weights so they will 
have some muscles and 
physical stamina, and I'm 
taking the cigarettes out of 
their hands so they can have 
some vocal power." 

Murray described "Fool 
for Love," which is receiving 
its first Fort Wayne 
production, as a "psycho- 
sexual free for all." Part of 



the play's appeal is its 
passion and volatility. 

"I think it gels as close to 
the essence of what love is, 
because love is a paradox: 
You can't live without it, and 
you can't live with it, so 
you're torn between the two. 
This dialectic moves the play 
forward. The love the main 
characters, May and Eddie, 
have in their minds for each 
other doesn't really exist — 
it's a myth and a fantasy. It 
drives them to complete 
physical and emotional 
exhaustion. The more real it 
gels, the more nightmarish it 
becomes," Murray said. 

Maureen Ryan plays May, 
and Kim Detwiler plays 
Eddie. Also in the cast are 
Clarence "Satch" Gatchell 
and Kevin D. Gilbert. 

"Fool for Love" opens 
Nov. 22, and weekend per- 
formances continue through 
Dec. 7. There is no per- 
formance on Thanksgiving 
evening, Thursday, Nov. 28

'Dorsey' entertains 

By M. KATHLEEN CREVEN 

Features Editor 

As everyone on campus should know by now, the Tommy 

Dorsey Orchestra is playing for a dance al the Grand Wayne 

Center Friday, Dec. 6. 

Sponsored by SUBOG, this gala event has been in the works 
since August, said Mary Brant, director of activities for 
student services. 

"In August, we worked (on the concert) at least 10 hours a 
week, student and faculty efforts combined. Now we log at 
least 30." 

Tickets have been sold almost exclusively through the 
Sweet Shoppe, in Walb Union, since the end of October 

"We've sold about 40 tables (of 10 seals each) so far," said 
Georgia Perry, manager of the Sweet Shoppe Perry has 
dispensed directions on how to reach the campus and the 
Shoppe along with the Tommy Dorsey tickets. She's even 
been known to stay open for a while alter her normal 5 p.m. 
closing time for those who wish to purchase tickets but can't 
make it here before then. 

"The box office has to be covered, posters have to be put up 
— I'm sure that we've spent hundreds of hours in preparation 
for the concert," said Brant 

One little advertised fact about the concert centers on the 
band members themselves. The bandleader. Buddy Morrow, 
is a veteran of the original Dorsey brigade. Even though 
Morrow is of the "Big Band" era, most of the other band 
members are not of the same vintage, but share his en- i 
thusiasm for the music of the 40's. 

Their repertoire embraces not only the popular Big Band 
Sound, but includes Dixieland, rhythm and blues, intricate 
ballads to progressive jazz or current rock tunes, making the 
Tommy Dorsey Orchestra a very versatile group of talented 
musicians.

Students from out of town must seek their own lodging 



By SEBASTIAN CHAPMAN 
Staff Writer 
As many computer 
campuses of its size. IPFW 
has no dormitory housing for 
students on its grounds 
Many students and faculty 
members believe this hin- 
ders the schools spirit of 
togetherness, directly af- 
fecting students' social and 
educational advantages. 

Although there has been an 
attempt made to house 



students on such grounds as 
Concordia Theological 
Seminary, most students are 
left to find their own 
housing at Spring Harbor, 
other apartments or houses 
throughout the city and the 
Canterbury Green facilities 
just north of the campus. 

Mary Brant, director of 
student activities, explained 
that she wishes that IPFW's 
foreign students "Could have 
some place on the campus to

on campus. 

She suggests that a club or 
"something of that nature" 
be formed to help students 
better adapt to American 
lifestyles that so many of 
them wish to explore. "Our 
tocation is so remote that we 
are isolated from residential 
life that other campuses 
have," Brant then added 
that an international house is 
a method most campuses 
try. 

For the moment, the 
Concordia dormitory set-up 
appears to be working rather 
well. Line Mitchell, IPFW 
junior, is a Dorm. Proctor at 
the facility. He said students 
there "need more of a social 
outlet." 

"Last year we had a VCR 
and we made our own in- 



tramural basketball squad, 
but right now we're still 
getting settled. We probably 
won't start any of our own 
activities until the winter 
months." Pool, table tennis 
and card games are among 
the livelier activities of the 
winter months at Concordia. 

Bryce Forman, IPFW 
junior, wishes that the 
campus have dormitories. 
"The bills at the apartment 
are ridiculous. You grow up 
fast when you're on your 
own." Forman and three 
friends from Gary, also 
students here, share a one 
bedroom apartment in the 
Spy Run area. 

"I get use of the bed most 
and the other fellas crash on 
the floor or wherever they 
can. We sometimes have 
girls over, mainly on 
weekends, and they're our 



dishwasher If you want to 



yoi 



havi 



to 



dishes." 

Ron Reynolds, another 
student housed in the Con- 
cordia facility, insisted that 
drinking isn't a problem 
most students there have, 
but with the lack of en- 
tertainment available, this 
comes as a surprise 

The campus does attempt 
to cater to students' 
recreational needs with its 
video game room and TV 
lounge. But, if you've ever 
wandered by these rooms on 
a Friday night don't strain 
your eyes looking for friends, 
because they won't be there. 

If anybody out there has 
valid ideas for an alternate 
style of housing, please 
contact the features editor. 
There may be a story here.

Students shape up at fitness centers 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 

Sports Editor 

The "thin look" is the "In 

look" this year, and people 

are nocking to local health 

clubs to "get into shape." 

The Fitness Connection 
and Body Works, two health 
clubs in the Fort Wayne 
area, provide various ways 
to exercise and "shape up." 
The Fitness Connection is 
located at 3233 St. Joe Center 
Road, in the Riviera Plaza 
They offer programs in 
aerobics and weight 
training, as well as in car- 
diovascular training. They 
also offer tanning beds in a 
Suntana Sun System, a 
whirlpool, and a Finnish 
rock sauna. All activities are 
supervised, and run seven 
days a week. A child care 
program is available as well. 
The Fitness Connection 
also offers a special 
program, as Director Rick 
Rutledge explains. "We have 
an orthopedic rehabilitation 
program, with licensed 
physical therapists for 
sports therapy." he says. 

The Fitness Connection 
offers a good workout for 
various IPFW students. The 
Mastodon women's and 
men's volleyball teams 
receive staff supervision at 
the health club, "They are 
involved in weight training, 
to help increase their ver- 
ticle jump," Rutledge says. 
Loren Gebert, a member 
of the IPFW men's volleyball 
learn, receives a thorough 
workout at the Fitness 
Connection. "I work out five 
days a week, for an hour 
each day," Gebert says. 

Gebert's daily activities 
vary. "On Monday, I work on 
the lower body." Gebert 
comments. He trains with 
such things as "power jump 
training," squats, toe raises. 



curls, and the leg press. On 
Tuesdays and Thursdays, 
Gebert performs with the 
free -weights and Nautilus 
equipment. 

Gebert works on the 
program with the volleyball 
team, but will probably 
continue to workout there 
after his volleyball years. "I 
used to lift weights in high 
school, but in college I 
stopped. Then Rick Rutledge 
got us a deal (the volleyball 
team at the Fitness Con- 
nection). I'll probably 
workout there for a long 
lime," Gebert soys. 

Various memberships can 
be purchased at the Fitness 
Connection. It costs $179 per 
year to belong, but other 
memberships are available 
as well. They offer 18-month 
and 30-month memberships, 
and the cost can be isolated 
to monthly payments. 
Rutledge explains, "It's an 
average of about $15 per 
month (to join)." The 
supervision at the club is 
included in the fees 

Rutledge estimates the 
average age of the ap- 
proximately 1,000 members 
in the 18-35 range. The most 
popular workout time varies. 
"Most people come in the 
early morning or the 
evening," Rutledge com- 
ments. 

Equipment is available in 
Ihe pro shop, and various 
nutritional supplements can 
be purchased at Believe Me 
It's Yogurt, (he frozen 
yogurt and sandwich cafe. 
Its apecial attraction, as the 
name indicated, is frozen 
yogurt Its taste resembles 
that of ice cream, and has 40 
percent less calories than ice 
cream A five-ounce cup of 
Columbo yogurt is $.90, while 



an eight-ounce container 
costs $1.40. A variety of 
toppings can be put on the 
yogurt, to produce a "sun- 
dae." 

Body Works Fitness 
Center is located at 3030 N. 
Clinton. One can work out on 
their Nautilus equipment, 
and participate in one of 
several aerobics classes 
each week. Bikes, a sauna, a 
whirlpool, and a tanning 
booth are also available al 
Body Works. 

Instruction in the various 
areas is a specialty of this 
fitness center. "We em- 
phasize individual in- 
struction," comments Greg 
Reilingof Body Works. "We 
feel we are the best in town 
lin this area)." 

The center is co-ed, and is 
open seven days a week. 
They offer various types of 
memberships. "We try to 
meet the individual needs (of 
Ihe customer)," Reiling 
says The yearly mem- 
bership is approximately 
$195, but a variety of plans, 
such as the three-month or 
six-month versions are 
available. 

The biggest crowd at the 
Body Works is in its 20's. 
according to Reiling The 
membership isn't limited to 
that age range, however 
"There are a lot of people in 
their 30's and up, the amount 
lof members) decreasing as 
the age increases," Reiling 
comments. "There are some 
in their 60's, 70's, and even a 
few in their 80's." 

The cold winter is ap- 
proaching, and that seems lo 
be the most papular time for 
people to join fitness centers. 
' 'People are looking for some 
place to exercise indoors," 
Reiling says

Spikers fall short of tournament victory 



ByJENNY BLAKLEY 
Sports Editor 

The 1985 women's 
volleyball season drew to a 
close last weekend for LPF- 
W. The Mastodons were 
seeded number one in the 
North Division going into the 
Great Lakes Valley Con- 
ference IGLVC) tour- 
nament, and were the 
defending champions. A 
second straight tourney 
crown was not to be, 
however, as IPFW lost a 
tough match to Indiana 
Central, seeded fourth in the 
South Division, on Friday 
The scores for the games 
were 9-15. 12-15 and 13-15. 
The tourney was played in 
Ashland. Ohio. 



The Mastodons played 
again on Saturday, defeating 
Bellarmine, 15-7, 2-15 and 15- 
11, and losing to Ashland 13- 
1S, 11-15 and 3-15. IPFW 
finished the tournament in 
sixth place overall. 

Head Coach Arnie Ball 
says several factors con- 
tributed to Friday's loss 
"Youth was a major factor," 
Ball comments. "Also, In- 
diana Central played ex- 
tremely well, and we did not 
(play well)." 

Last year's team did not 
encounter the difficulties a 
young team can. "Last year, 
we had three seniors and 
three all-conference players. 
This year, we only had one 
senior." 



Friday's loss broke a 14- 
game winning streak for the 
Mastodons. "Of course, we 
were very disappointed. 
There was a strong 
possibility that we would win 



(the tournamenti," Ball 
says. 

"This season's young learn 
could become an advantage 
for next year, however. "1 
think we will have a good 



team next year. We will be 
very solid," Ball comments, 
..rJHps'r' erf the players will 
return, and they will have 
had another year of ex- 
perience."

Mastodons start season with new coach 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 
S ports Editor 

The IPFW women's 
basketball team has a new 
(ace this year Julie Calahan 
is starling her first job as a 
head coach, coming to IPFW 
after being an assistant 
coach at Montana State 
University. Before her three 
years at Montana Slate, she 
was a graduate assistant al 
Ohio State. 

Calahan is hoping for a 
good season this year, and 
feels the team has several 
positive attributes. "The 
biggest strength of Ihe team 
is ihe balance We will be 
very balanced scoring- 
wise," Calahan says. "A lot 
of people will gel a lot of 
playing lime Several dif- 
ferent people will average 
double figures in Ihe game." 
The leam"s hard work in 



the preseason hopefully will 
pay off for them during the 
season. "We have been 
working hard, and have been 
conditioning since Sep- 
tember," Calahan com- 
ments. "We have been 
practicing since Oct 15, so 
we are in good shape. It's 
hard lo tell if we're ready to 
play someone else (since we 
haven't had our first garnet, 
but I think we'll be ready." 

An additional strength of 
the team stems from good 
preseason drills. "We have 
good fundamentals, skills 
and execution," Calahan 
says. "We will have an up- 
tempo style of game." 

The Mastodons have two 
reluming starters from last 
year's 9-5 learn, which 
finished third in Ihe Great 
Lakes Valley Conference 
(GLVC). Rhonda Unverferth 



and Joan Wenning were 
lost due lo graduation. But, 
as Calahan says. "We have 
basically everyone else 
back " Becky Patterson, one 
of the possible returners, is 
redshirting this year 
because of an injury. 

"Overall, we are a fairly 
young team," Calahan 
comments. "We are still 
learning a lol of new things, 
and people will be placed 
into some new roles. 
(Because I am a firsl year 
coach) they will have lo 
learn new offenses and 
defenses. Hopefully this will 
develop into a slrengih as 
lime goes on We will gel 
used to each other, and will 
gel belter with every game. 
We will continue lo improve 
until ithe newness) is no 
longer a weakness." 

Oakland is the Mastodons' 
Orel opponent IPFW will be 
plaving at Oakland on Nov. 
23. "Oakland is quite a bit 
taller than us," Calahan 
says. "Several of their 



In his fourth season al 
fPFW, Tim Russell, men's 
basketball coach, hopes lo 
improve on last year's 16-11 



Russell stales this year's 

bigger, stronger, and 

talent and depth 




The Mastodons will have lo 
perform well in several 
areas to compensate for 
their heighlh disadvantage. 
"We are not exceptionally 
big." Calahan comments. 
"We musi have a good posl 
defense (keep the ball out of 
the middle). We won't 
dominate with our size, so 
we'll have to block out and 
still rebound well." 

Grand Valley Stale is the 
Mastodon's first home op- 
ponent. IPFW will play 
Grand Valley State at the 
Multipurpose Building, 
beginning at 7 p.m. on Nov. 
2C. "They match up with us a 
litlle better sizewise (than 
Oakland)," Calahan ex- 
plains. "They are in a 
similar position as we are, 
with two lop scorers 
gradualed." Grand Valley 
Slate lost five players last 
year, with eight people 
returning, including two 
starters. 



people reluming, including 
two starters. 

IPFW is a Division II 
college, but Calahan feels 
after a few years, the 
Mastodons will be a more 
competitive school. "We are 
progressing very well," 
Calahan says. "With some 
more work and tradition in 
the program, we will be able 
to compete with some 
Division I schools " 

Calahan also has seen a 
few positive changes in 
women's sports. "Overall, 
women's athletics has 
improved tremendously 
(with the number of fans 
increasing)," Calahan says. 
"Mostly the team needs 
exposure I think if people 
come and walch us, they'll 
be pleasantly surprised. If 
we gel people to come to the 
gym once, I think they'll tend 
to come back. There is a lot 
more finesse and a lot more 
action (with the 30 second 
clock). It's an exciting brand 
of basketball." 



Shooters hope to capitalize on fresh talent 




,»„ the learns he has 
coached at IPFW in the past. 
And Russell says even 
though the Mastodons are an 
improved learn, ihe rest of 
Ihe conference is also. Two 
of the teams in the Great 
Lakes Valley conference 
have all five starters 
reluming from their 19H-85 
season. 

"The success of this 
season will be based on 
speed and desire," said 

Russell. 

The Mastodons will be led 
by experienced six-foot-eight 
inch Jim Morlan, who, along 
with Bruce Erwin, will have 
lo be aggressive under the 
basket, according to Russell.

Mastodons lose to Lafayette 



ByTONYDUNAWAY 
Staff Writer 

On Thursday, Nov. 14, the 
Mastodons fell in defeat to 
the Lafayette Hustlers, an 
AAU representative. The 
Hustlers are composed of 
pla yers from the recent past. 
Some were well-known stars 
in their respective con- 
ferences, Ricky Hall, Brian 
Walker. Mark Atkinson and 
John Anlhrop from Purdue, 
for example 

The Mastodons got off to a 
slow and shaky start, but 
managed to stay within 



reach of the Hustlers, 
trailing 31-19 at the half. 

At the beginning of the 
second half, the young 
Mastodons sent the older and 
more experienced Hustlers a 
message, in not giving up. 
Led by Bruce Rolands' 21 
points and Lawrence Jor- 
dan's spirited play, the 
Mastodoris closed to within 
three points at 39-36 with 
fourteen minutes left in the 
game But the size and 
muscle of the Hustlers, 
coupled with the hot-handed 
Hall, proved too much for 



IPFW, losing 77-70. 

Following' the IPFW 
contest, the fans at the 
Memorial Coliseum v 
treated to the IU lntra-Squad 
game. 

The Mastodons' nexl 
opponent will be Wright 
Slate, ranked. fourth in the 
nation in Division II. The 
game will be on Nov. 23 at 
7:30 p.m. in the Multipurpose 
Building. Tickets entitle the 
purchaser to a hot dog and 
chili supper, served at 5 p.m 
prior to Ihe game.

By JENNY BLAKLEY 
Sports Editor 

IPFW sports fans will soon 
be able to watch Maslodon 
basketball from their living 
room chairs Cable channel 
23 will be carrying the games 
of Ihe 1985-86 men's season. 

Hopefully. Channel 23 
Director Angie Scofield says, 
Ihe basketball games will be 
popular viewing items. "We 
don't know how many games 
we'll be covering We hope lo 
gel a good response from the 
audience. 1 ' 

Channel 23 is a college 
access channel. lis station is 
in the bottom floor of the 



Helmke Library at IPFW 
A college access channel 
differs somewhat from a 
public access station. 
Scofield explains, "The 
university is allowed to use 
fa college access channel), 
but there's not much done 
with it. They are trying hard 
to get people to use it, 
though." 

The basic principles of the 
college and public access 
channels are similar, 
however. "Cable (t.v.l is 
allocated a certain number 
of channels for public ac- 
cess," Scofield comments. 
"Public access (channels) 
are provided to the com- 



munity to allow community 
access to television, They 
allocate money to purchase 
equipment and to pay 
salaries, but it's for com- 
munity use; it's not meant to 
compete with the major 
networks." 

Scofield adds, "It's often 
been called the 'electronic 
soapbox'." 

Scofield explains the 
availability of Channel 23. 
"If you have a basic (cable) 
service, and you live in the 
city, you can pick up Channel 
23." This basic service 
usually includes the first 30 
cable channels. 



Channel ten is combining 
its efforts with Channel 23 to 
televise the basketball 
games. "Channel 23 is not 
equipped lo show the games 
II will be a joint effort with 
Channel ten, who has the 
video cameras and Ihe rest 
of the equipment." 



This is the first year of the 
basketball program, and it is 
Scofield's first year al D?F- 
W's Channel 23 as weU. She 
has been involved in work 
with cable access channels 
for approximately five 
years, but has been Channel 
23's director for about three 
months. 



Channel 23's coverage 
stretches into other campus 
activities. It covers leclures 
at IPFW, and has two 
*lruclured programs. "Give 
and Take" is a program 
slressing economics, geared 
toward seniors in high school 
and college freshmen. 11 also 
offers "Outline," a variety 
program. "(Outline ) follows 
a magazine formal. It is a 
feature-type of program," 
Scofield says, 



Nov. 23 marks the first 
night of Channel 23's live 
coverage of IPFW basket- 
ball. The game will be 
televised at 7:30 p.m.
