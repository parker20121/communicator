Interested in 
Bible Study ? 

Would you like to study 
ious concepts and princi- 
s found in the Bible, and 
apply them lo present day 
living? I would like to know 
if a group of students would 
like to have a weekly meeting 
for group discussion and study 
of this nature. If you arc inter- 
ested please contact Assl. 
Prof. Ed Meseal in Room 281 
or call extension 303. 



ikinR for a "non-political 
opproach to student govern- 
ment." He pledged a "main- 
lainance of constant dia- 
logue among all concerned 
parties of the university 
community." 

Mr. Gillie then com- 
mented on several of the 
prof^rams of the Students' 
GovernmenV which are now, 
or will soon be, in operation 
at the campus. 

The first and foremost 
project of The Students' 
■Government is the "provi- 
sionaTCampus Parliament." 
This proposal which will im- 
part authority on the entire 
campus community, has 
been unanimously approved 
by the Student Assembly, 
and will be put before the 
faculty senates and deans 
for endorsement, and then 
will go to the Boards of 
Trustees of the two univer- 
sities for fine

process of drafting a pro- 
posal for submission to the 
student body for approval by 
referendum. It calls for a 
reduction of S9 in the acti- 
vity fee. which would be 
paid b&gt; all students. He 
criticized the varsity ath- 
letic program, outlining var- 

quilies in that prdgrnm, and 
accepted the inlramurel pro- 
gram. Gillie feels that the 
amount of money which is 
spent on the present ath- 
letic program is "dispropor-

Circle K 
Questionaire 
Results 

The results of the Cir- 
cle K Questionaire were 
tabulated by Kenny Scott, 
Stale Governor of Circle K. 
The results showed exactly 
what he had anticipated-- 
thal most people on campus 
know very little about Cir- 
cle K. The three categories 
Its compiled are as 



follows. 

Seven per cent of the 
people knew about Circle K 



and i 






ity pro- 
jects, sponsorship, and in- 
ternational affairs. 

Thirty-one per cent 
knew something about Cir- 
cle K. Many people think 
Circle K's only function is 
lo operate the cloak check. 

A startling sixty-two 
per cent had never heard of 
Circle Kl 

Since over ninety per 
cent of the people filling 
out the questionaire are not 
really aware of the function 
of Circle K. Governor Scott

PROCEDURE QUESTIONED

Gillie 



oj Laws, thousands of 
laws, conflictins laws, laws duplicating one another— ye i. 
for Ihf orderly functioning of our student govcrnmeril, llx^re ■ 
must exist guidelines, lows. 

When discrepancies arise among existing laws or when 
a deficiency is found in our existing laws, we follow our 
constitutionally outlined procedure in rectifying our system 

However, when our system of law needs to be modified 
by the campus administration, the procedure to be followed 
is not relevant. For the aiudenl government to amend its 
law, a time-^onsumiig, complex procedure must be followed. 
At this lime, The Students' Covernmenl has pending before 
the final board of approval not less than six constitutional 
ammendments. These six reach back to May of the previous 
school year. They will not be acted upon until [acuity 
appointees are named to that final board. How long can we 
wait? 

Yd, through britUanI maneuvering by the Purdue ad- 
ministration of this campus, the constitution of The Stu- 
dents' Government has been 'radically changed. It/ien queried 
about the legality of such a move. Dean L. 0. Nelson re- 
plied that the student soveriment' should amend its con- 
stitution to fit the administrative change. 

Shot about the endless delay which we face to work 
through our system of low? Does it not apply to all parties 
in the university? Upon a glance it con be seen that the ad- 
ministration docs not work tvithin the system when that 
system cannot salisly immediately. The system only ap- 
plies to those who have no alternative method of operating. 
It seems that the word effective could be substituted for 
the word alternative. 

Please lake note. Our administrators have shown us 
how to deal effectively with a system which frustrates the 
ends of the members living under that system. In other words 
they have said. "Ignore the law whenever it does not fit 
your ends." ,1 vcr^ nijl. m,-.,n.s of amend,nf^ a ronsu,u&gt;,an
