Kettler's dream in his wallet 



No hope for dorms 



By KELLt KIRKPATRICK 

Staff Writer 

IPFW may nol have donni tori b, but 

(he university does have a contract 

wllh Concord ui Theological Seminary 

to bouse lU and Purdue sOidents. 

And over 100 IPFW students 
taking advantage of the available 
rooms and reduced student rates. 

John Carnaghi, vice chancellor for 
financial affairs, said building iixna 
on IPFW is not an administrative 
consideration. 

-K's nol In the founding father's 
criginalcharler,'^ said Camaghl. 

He explained the 1S20 diarter does 
not preclude regional campuses from 
having dornu. bu( the Board ti

philosophy to fund regional campus

student senator Susan Wdf decided to

'This is kind of a followup on the 
article." Wolf said abcul Women's 
Interest Weelt March 4-7. WoU said 
that she feels thai men and women on 
campus shaild tiecome more aware rt 
and concerned about rape. 

Women's Inleresl Wert starts off 
with a self-defense class on Monday, to 
be taught by Sgt. Atkinson ti the Ftrt 
Wayne Police Athletic League. The 
class will tie in the Multlpirpixe 
Building, rom 11!. at7 p.m. 

Events will cmtiiue on Tuesday,

Indiana University-Purdue 
Univcralty at Indianapolis llU PUD is 
the largest regional campus ar&gt;d the 
only one with dormitories. 

Carnaghi said state lunding would 
nol be available for dorms, even 
Ihough the university is on state 
property. IPFW would have to foot the 
bill 

A single high-rise building cculd 
exceed elghl million dollars, he said. 

"II we put up dorms and nobody 
lives there, the banks still want their 
payments And we're talking big, big 
l»ymenls," Carnaghi said. 

"The kind ti communiti' has a lot to 

know how much they want (hat la

But sludeni apartments funded

A small piece of paper, now yellowed 
wllh age and tattered at the edges, 
represents the dream one man had to 
combine Ihe resources of Indiana and 
Purdue universities InFort Wayne. 

On (he paper was a sketch of parcels 
of land that might be acquired for a 
combined campus. The man la Alfred 
W Kettler, who earned his dream In 
his wallet for yea ra. 

The Idea for uniting the two 
universities was conoeivEd by Kettler 
around 19M Viewing the locations of 
the Purdue Extension Building and 
Indiana Univeralty Extension in 
downtown Fort Wayne, he questioned 
whether this was the besl way lo 
promote higher education Kettler, 
who was elected n Purdue Trueslee In 
1W7. ticlleved the instlhiUons were 
competing with each other. He thought 
the student! would benefit by theunion 

The Indiana-Purdue Fojodatlon, 
which Kettler helped eslablilh, 
arranged lo purchase the ti 









program.

sliuclion of the First educational 
building 

The campus, known as Indiana- 
Purdue Regional Campus at Fort 
Wayne, was dedicated on Nov 8. 1»«. 
Thekeynole speaker at the ceremmy 
was Judge John S. HasUngs. chief 
Justice ti the Scvenlh District US 
Court of Appeals in Clicago and for- 
mer president of the Indiana 
Universlly Board of Trtatees. 

In his address, Hastings said, "1 
name one man whose unselfish 
devotion and complete personal 
dedication lo this project lymbolius 



In May of \«n. KetUer waa honored 
for his commitment lo (he develop' 
mcnt of IPFW by Ihc naming of the 
firstmBjar campus bulldlnfl Alfred W 
KetUer Hall. 

Recognlicd as playing a vllnl rote In 
advancing community luppori and 
nnancini assialoncc for the Joint 
campus, Keltler is quick In point out 
oihera wore involved In thceffort "My 
name has been menboncd loo many 
limes." he said In a (ait Interview. 

AlttiouKh he nim prefen lo remain 
on ihesldellnm, Kettler la described aa 
(he "most persistent party behind (he 
uniting of the two eitenalon 
operations" by John Ankenbruck. 
Journal Isl and hUlorlan. AnkenbriKk 
Is the author n "The Creation Yean," 
a book about IPFW. 

As a result of Kettler's Iniptratlon 
and dedlcallon. IPFW is the ililh 
brgcsl Instlhitlon of higher education 
In Indiana. In order to retain Ita 
standard of quality, KelUer believes 
that IPFW must continue to offer a 
well-rounded curriculum. In addition 
to keeping astride the changing world 
"Academics are first, that's what , 
we're here lor. ' he latd 

A 1315 l^irdue graduate, Kettler wa 
a recipleot of (he Dlsilngulihed 
Alumni Award, pioented by (he 
National AhimnlAuoclat]onlnl9E7 In 
ISTI, he received the firat honorary

Recently Kettler donated hts sketch of

Kids should earn day off 



In IdW, the youth of Fort Wayne 
helped Mve IhU city from the MCOnd 
wortt nood In ita hl»ti&gt;ry- The work was 
dlrly and difficult, but high school kidi 
came out in full force lo thovel und and 
Inu ihv heavy bags onto huge piles to 
hall the dangerous progreai ot the 
muddy, nwlrllng waien 

Nobody could deny IhoK kldi the 
crpdil for keeping our city from going 
under, nnd the pride they mint have felt 
when thL-y flood back after the crtiils and 
KUrveycd what they had done was well 
ilcterved. 

School! all over the area allowed kids 
lo be absenl If Ihcy would agree to help 
wllh Ihc sandbagging efforls, and un- 
doubledly, Rome of them helped for Just 
that reason. 

So, u bunch of kids got a day or two off 
school In order lo save their city. No 
great Inns lo the Ideals of public 
educullun Whatever their mollvallon, 
Ihoao hlds performed a gret service lo 
tho cummunlly and eventually 



everything returned to normal. 

Now here's the nood of I9es Not as 
bad as In 'B2, but still a potential disaster 
tor Fort Wayne. And once again, the city 
had lo rely on ils youth to stop the 
deluge. 

Only this time, Fort Wayne com- 
munity Schools not only allowed 
volunteer* the day off, they cancelled 
school in the hope the kids would use 
their free day to go downtown and fill 
sandbags. 

Nobody wants lo think most of the 
volunteers of 'SZ volunteered just to get a 
day off school, but of course it was one 
heck of a motivaling factor So why 
change a system that worked so well? 

Unfortunately, many of the people who 
gotanuncxpccted vacation day Tuesday 
did not volunteer to heave sandbags 
around. Those who did deserve even 
more credit than the volunteers of 'B2. 
because they already had a day off 
school. Their only mollvallon was civic 
pride.
