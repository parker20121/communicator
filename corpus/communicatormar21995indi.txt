govcrnmeni and his short tenure as direcior of exterior 
affairs on Mark King's fomier executive council will

Photography department 
produces six finalists 
in national competition 



By Adam Sanders 
Surr Writer 

Six IPI^ advanced photogra- 
phy students have reached the 
finals in the l^th annual Best of 
College Phoiograpliy Contest spon- 
sored by Photographer's Forum 
Magazine and Nikon. 

Rachel Deitmer. Steve Helm, 
Kevin Oswald, Shane Perfect. 
Aaron Steel, and Laiiette Till com- 
peted among 19,500 entries to 
reach the finalist stage of the 
nation-wide competition. 

Six perccni of the images sub- 
miiied for the competition were 
selected for funhef review by a 
panel of judges consisting of a pro- 
fessional phoiographet. a Nikon 
represeniativc. and an instructor of 
photography from the Brooks 
Insdtuie of Photography. 

The top four finalists from the 
black and white and color cate- 
gories are each given cash awards 
and have their images published in 
a special issue of Photographer's 
Forum Magazine. All the finalLsts' 
names and images will be pub- 
lished in the Best of College 
Photography Annual, available in 
June. 

Steven Perfect has been instiua- 
ing photography classes ai IPFW 
for three years and has wimessed 
the progress of his students, "Some 
of the finalists have been with me 



for a couple of years now and it has 
been fantastic to see them develop." 
Perfect continued. "IPFW has some 
exceptional siudents. Tbey have an 
incredible track record of producing 
material that deserves to be seen. 

"I was extremely excited that 
e«ry shidem who entered the com- 
petition made it to the finalist 
round" 

The IPFW instructor said his 
classes focused on technique, fun- 
damentals, and aeating an environ- 
meni which moved at a pace com- 
fortable for the siudents. 

Perfect said, "I told my students 
that if they wanted to work hard, 1 
could teach them any number of 
techniques. They have worked 
hard, extremely hard, and ii has 
paid off. 1 try to instill the form and 
technique, then lei ihe student 
develop his at her own vision on an 
individual basis." 

Perfect first became interested in 
photography when he received a 
camera for Christmas in the seventh 
grade. 

But be was initially amazed. 
years earlier, when he first wit- 
nessed ibe formation of an image in 
his father's dark room. He 
described the experience as 
"magic." Thai initial piece of magic 
led 10 a passion for photography 
which has since blossomed into a 
career. 

According to Perfect, the key 



priority. "Diversity is a very important issue to me," 
Eads said. "1 am looking forward to working with dif- 
ferent groups on campus. I want lo sec the needs of 
everyone." 

Eads' running mate for vice president of legislation 
Shawn Stanley agrees that students should come first on 
campus. "We share a loi of ideas on student rights," 
Stanley said. "The first thing that we both share Is thai 
students come first." 

For Stanley the position will allow her to enhance 
her education while sticking up for herself and fellow 
sludcnis. 

"It is hard for me to sit back at a senate position ... I 
want to be where the action is," Stanley said. "I want to 



do more. 1 am not one of those followers. 1 don't want 
to sit back and let people decide things for me. I want to 
make those decisions." 

Stanley said, "It will give me a lot of experience 
working with legislation, being in a leadership role and 
being successfiil. Ii will be wonderful for my education. 
and I think that I can do a good job controlling the 
Senate." 

Eads said he did not want to comment much on his 
opponent. "I don't want to slam Jeff I don't know what 
his beliefs are," Eads said. "I hope thai this is a very 
clean campaign, I want this to be a camp.ilgn of Issues." 

Valdez was unavailable for comment. 

The deadline for petitions is Friday March 3.

Celebrations planned for IPFW 



By Meli.ssB Youiig-FIores 
Chief Reporter 

The. Center of Women and 
Reluming Adults is sponsoring and 
co-sponsoring several events on 
L;jmpus during March in honor of 
Women's History Month. 

"You hear more about men than 
women," said Lois Kctlerer, secre- 
Luy of the Center for Women and 
Returning Adults. "It [Women's 
History Month] is to focus on 
women's achievements in society in 
various aspects. Women's History 
Mondi is to recognize the achicve- 
menLs of women past and present" 

The first event scheduled for the 
thirteenth will highlight the national 
theme, "Women in History: 
Promises to Keep." 

The session will take place in 
Classroom Medical Room \4S from 
noon through 1 p.m. and will be 
presented by Esther Deal, who has 



studied women's history for over 
ten years. 

According to Deal, women 
should gain from her presentation 
"a lot of respect for Ihe women who 
preceded them and paved the way." 

Deal pl:uis to emphasize the 16 
women featured on Ihe national 
poster as well as three additional 
women: Eleanor Roosevelt, anthro- 
pologist Margaret Mead and health 
advocate Annie Wauneka. 

"There b a lot in the world that 
still needs to be done," Deal s;iid. 

Events have been scheduled for 
every school week during the 
month. Jane Gastineau. associate 
professor of history, will also make 
a presentation. Two films are al.so 
scheduled to increase awareness of 
women's history, as welt as a panel 
discussion on welfare reform and 
women. 

College Access Cable Channel 6 
will be featuring several programs 



on women's issues. The programs 
will address issues such as black 
women in America, feminism, and 
women in television. 

According to Kettcrer, colleges 
and universities are the in.stitutions 
which usually recognize Women's 
History Month, however she did 
comment that several local orgiini- 
zaiions arc also honoring women. 

WBNI FM 89.1 is featuring 
music iuid stories by women during 
the month of March, The Fort 
Wayne Historical Museum is host- 
ing a presentation on "Mother 
George — Fort Wayne's Civil War 
Saint" and the YWCA is sponsor- 
ing an Internal ional Women's Day 
reception and youlb award presen- 
tation. 

Additional information can be 
received at the Center for Women 
and Returning Adults in Walb 
LInion 025, 



elements in becoming a quality 
photographer are persistency, pas- 
sion, and taidi in yourself 

Perfect said, "There is no wrong 
way to become a good photograph- 
er. I give my students the tools and 
techniques, they give me an image, 
and then we talk about vision. I am 
extremely proud of my students. 
Their accomplishments don't come 
easy." 

Perfect's son Shane, one of the 
six finalists, said he Is grateful for 
his father's contributions and devo- 
tion to the students. "I think he geis 
a great deal of his reward from see- 
ing the students create while pa.ss- 
ing along all his information and 
knowledge on the subject" he said, 

Shane's interest in photography 
first began when his father gave 
him a 35aun camera lo take along 
on his trip to Italy in 1992. 

Shane explained, "My father 
told me 'you're not going to go 
over to Rome without a camera.' 
So he gave me a camera and ! 
ended up taking die mime picture." 
His composite picture of an Italian 
street mime pan-handhng combined 
wiih the image of a cloudy sky, 
received honorable mention from 
the contest Shane hopes to take his 
talent into the world of computer 
imaging or advertising. 

Photographs by the siudents are 
being displayed on the second floor 
of the Fine Ans Building.

Brcll Aschliman and Audrey 
Osborn spcni lasi fall ai Disney 
World to gain "Living. Learning, 
and Working" experience. 

The two sludenu were ch05en in 
March 1994 to participate in Walt 
Disney World's College Program. 
'Die program, which is open to all 
majors, gives undergraduates an 
introduction to the world of hospi- 
tality. 

Along with working at the 
resort, students attend weekly three 
hour seminars, and earn college 
credit. 

Osbom, a sophomore majoring 
In hotel, restaurant and tourism 
management, said she is glad she 
took pan in the program. 

"It helped me to mold what 1 
want to do for a career," she said. 

The College Program, which 



lasts Tor 10 to 14 weeks during the 
spring, summer, and fall semesters, 
employs students at the Walt 
Disney World Resort in central 
Florida, 

Osborn worked as a merchan- 
dising hostess at Port Wilderness 
Campground. Restocking shelves 
with souvenirs and T-shirts was 
among her duties. 

Aschliman worked at the 
Polynesian Hotel, across from the 
Magic Kingdom, He cleaned 
rooms, shampotted carpets, "what- 
ever needed to be done." be said. 

For Aschliman, also a sopho- 
more in the hotel, restaurant, and 
tourism management program, the 
best part ot the job was "the 
accomplishment of getting the job 
done, meeting a challenge every 
day." The program also helped him 
to decide upon a career path. 

Work schedules often required 
the students to rise early to catch 



the bus. Each worked approximate- 
ly 40 hours per week. 

During time-off, they could 
flash their Disney ID's for free 
admission to the park. 

"I spent most of my spare time 
at Epcot." said Osbom, who had 
not been lo Disney World before 
participating in the College 
Program. "It's defmiiely one of the 
perks." 

Aschliman went to the theme 
parks ■'... a lot. three Umes a week 
at teasL" 

The living experience for the 
students was life broadening. 
Students are housed at Vista Way 
apartments, near the resort, wiih 
American or international siudent.s. 

"Rooming with International 
people was very beneficial," said 
Osborn. "The friends that you 
make down there change your life." 

Although Aschliman described 
the experience as "a blast," he also

said it is hard work and not for 
everyone. 

"You have to be able to be away 
from home, even during the holi- 
days," be said. 

Aschliman said he feels he was 
rewarded with the experience he 
took home with bim. 

"I received excellent experience 
with a big company," he said. 



John Knight, the director of 
IPFW's hotel, restaurant, and 
tourism management program 
would encourage anyone from any 
major to participate in the program. 
because it provides "experience 
with a company that is recognized 
worldwide, experience that defi- 
nitely helps on a resume."

If you did not have the chance 
to see the Purdue- Indiana Theater 
(PIT) production of "Who's Afraid 
of Virginia Woolf at the Williams 
Theater this last weekend then you 
still have one more chance to catch 
this deep, soul-searching play. 

Edward Albee. an American 
playwright born in 1928. has 
brought many explosive stories to 
the stage such as "Zoo Story," 
(1959) and "Tiny Alice" (1964). 
But "Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf (1962). under the direction 
of dieaier department chair, Larry 
Life, is an interesting rollercoa.ster 
of rtality vs. illusion.

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q: Are you going to 
offer HIV testing on 
campus again soon? 

A: Yes. Free, 
confidential, and 
anonymous HIV 
antibody testing and 
counseling will be 
offered soon at IPFW. 
The dates are March 27 
through March 30. 
Watch for posters on 
campus for details. 



To have your questio 
about HIV/AIDS a 



The adult humor was funny, but 
hard to catch at umes. 

As the evening progresses into 
dawn, experience powerful revela- 
tions as they delve deep into the 
human psyche. Albee sure knew 
what he was doing when he creat- 
ed this play, but Life has taken it 
one step closer lo perfection. 

Life directed the four actors in 
such a way that ihey blend well 
together. The four actors together 
create an ensemble of notable tal- 



ent and obvious hard work. And 
thanks to Life's excellent direction. 
the complex lives the actors por- 
tray are both vivid and real. 

Despite the story's deep plot of 
twisted truths, which arc revealed 
one by one, the audience can be 
drawn in and captivated by the 
emotion of the ptay. Due to the taJ- 
ent on the stage and behind the 
scenes, and the compelling story of 
two couples' lives, I give this play 
three stars out of a possible four. 



IPFW campus, and four to eight 
students are chosen for each semes- 
ter. Aschliman and Osbom advise 
students who are interested in the 
program to be enthusiastic, smiling 
and outgoing when meeting with 
the representatives from Disney. 

To really enjoy the Walt Disney 
World Program, said Aschliman. 
"You've got to have a kid in you."

IPFW STUDENT 
PROGRAM BENEFITS All 



By Angle Smilh 
SUfT Writer 

How long has il been sintc 
you've had your ictlh cleaned? Do 
you fee! like you get tipped off 
every lime you go to the demist? 
Then I may have the solution for 
you. 

In.siead of being overcharged by 
a regular dcnUsi whom you mosi 
likely will never even sec, you can 
help IPI-W students gain credit 
and experience at a reasonable 
price. The dcparlmenl of dental 
hygiene offers a dental clinic (hat 
helps students gain credit and also 
provides a service lo the commu- 
nity. 

The clinic's hours are as fol- 
lows: Monday through Thursday, 
8 a.m. lo 12 p.m. and 1p.m. to 5 
p.m. and Friday from 8 a.m. to 12 
p.m.. The clinic is not open on 
weekends. 

The clinic offers regular clean- 
ings, which includes the cleaning. 
examination and Houride treat- 
ment, and also offers X-rays. 

If you would like to visit the 
clinic you can either make an 



.^ppoinimeni or you can walk in. 
The clinic is located in Ncff Hall 
in Room 109. The clinic's phone 
number 1.^481-6575. 

The costs vary if you arc a stu- 
dent, a child or a member of the 
faculty and staff, if you would like 
further information about the 
prices than feel free to call (he 
clinic or drop by. 

The clinic's dental students 
would like lo see more participa- 
tion from the faculty, staff and stu- 
dents. Denial hygiene siudeni 
Hillary Hamby said. "I don't think 
a lot of people know it (the clinic) 
is here." However, she acknowl- 
edged that the students are not as 
quick a.s a regular dental service. 

One of the advantages is the 
reasonable cost. The drawback is 
that because students perform the 
cleanings, it can lake hours for Just 
one cleaning. The students per- 
form the cleaning service during 
their lab hours, and, since they are 
being graded, they are especially 
careful. But have no fear, there is 
always a dentist in the clinic to 
help out and make sure everything

University needs 

to balance its faculty 



If you aie mking a class ai this 
unjvccslly, chance.i arc Ihal ii is 
lauj^hl by a while male. That is 
btcaux only (xic-lhlid of (he facul- 
ty mcmhcrs are women, and an 
even smaller pcrccnuigc are minori- 
lics. Why U Uiis? 

)( you lotik further inio the uni- 
vcrsily at the people who make 
many of the decisions which affect 
our education, you will find that 
they are also predominately while 
males. 

These discrepancies can be 
explained in a variety of ways. Bui 
explanations do noi cul lo [he bean 
of the metier. What is ihis adminis- 
Ualion doing to rectify the situa- 
tion? 

This university has had various 
hiring practices over the past 20 
years. Because of the low rate of 
lumovcr in some dcparimcnLs, the 
current make-up of the academic 
staff is greatly affected by those 
practices. The make-up of the 
administrative staff should be less 
affected, and should icprcsent a 
more up-io-dalc outlook on the way 
a university is run. 

in examining the faculty ai 
IPFW. one fmds that only 4 out of 
50 tenured professors are female. 
When asked to cxplaiti this. 
Frederick Kirchtioff, interim vice 
chancellor of academic affairs, said 
this was cau.&lt;^ mainly by two fac- 
tors. One factor is the time it takes 
for faculty members lo attain the 
position of tenured professor. This 
process lakes approximately 12 
years, if not longer. 

He also aitribuicd the discrepan- 
cy to the dispioporUonately small 
number of women who graduate in 
some subject areas, such as science 
and math. Although more women 



have graduated in these subjects 
recently. Diey are not represented 
on IPFWs staff. 

Kirchhoff said many depart- 
ments' goals reflect Iheir desire to 
have mon and women and people 
with varied cultural and elhnic 
backgrounds represented in their 
faculty. If this is truly the case, then 
we applaud these departments. 
However, the actual staffs of these 
departments do noi reflect these 
goals. 

If this is due to low turnover in 
the past few years, then these 
departments need lo actively try to 
meet their goals when openings do 
occur. 

Oiher positions in the university 
are dominated by females. One- 
hundred percent of the clerical staff 
at IPFW is female. Why is this? 
And why are most of the upper- 
level administrative positions filled 
by white males? The chancellor is a 
man, so are all three vice chancel- 
lors. 

Several administrative positions 
have recently opened up in the uni- 
versity. Will the university actively 
search for a minority or a female lo 
fill these positions? 

TTie administrative staff at [his 
university will not become raciaUy 
balanced by iiself. It will take work 
ajid perseverance on the pan of the 
current administrative staff, and on 
the pari of ihc student body. The 
committees responsible for filling 
these positions will need to make 
sure their searches target all possi- 
ble candidates for the positions. 
The students will also need to 
express their concern about these 
problems and a.sk the university to 
hire more women and more minori- 
ties.

Dear Edilon 

Thanks to the commentary writ- 
ten by Mr. Douse, a remarkable 
idea came to me. Being of Meucan 
descent and able to trace my ances-

war with Mexico. 

After careful deliberations. I 
decided against suing and wasting 



Women's talents not 
emphasized by society 

If 1 am not mistaken, the year is ure to recognize and place value on 
1995. Women have had the right to those traits which are considered 
vote for 75 years. So why are feminine. To call a man feminine is 
women still fighting to be treated as to put him down, 
equals by today's society? Why is this the case, and how 

In order to try to gain et^ual sta- did it end up this way? To answer 
lus, many women in the w&lt;»'kplace these questions we have to look

Women wear their hair short and United States. Many of them were

Women learn that if ihcy want to countries for die religious freedom 
offered by the new colonies. In 
these colonies women bad a very 
specific place. 

During colonial times a 
woman's main role was to keep 
house and raise the children. The 
men were responsible for the farm 
chores, which required more manu- 
al labor. This breakdown of labor 
was the most [Hactical arrangement 
at the time. 

Today, most men do not spend 
much time doing farm chores. In 
fad. often they are not doing any 
kind of physical labor at all. 

During World Wars I and II 
women moved into the work force 
out of necessity. After the war, 
many women wanted to retain this 
autonomy, and they fought for it. 

Women have moved into the 
work force, and though they repre- 
sent a minority, tbey are there to 
slay.

down of the American family has 
been caused by ibis trend. I dis-

Many women are the primary 
caretakers of their children Their 
families often come first. 
Employers should try to be flexible 
with dieir working environments. 

Outdated office policies which 
perpetuate the typical eighi-to-five 
working day may cause difficulties 
for single parents These employees 
may be less productive because of 
these policies. By adapting their 
poUcies to the employees of the 90s 
employers will end up with a happi- 
er and more productive work force. 

Women are women. They ^e as 
good as men. but they are good at 
different things. They have differ- 
ent needs and desires, and they are 
raised differently. The sooner our 
society begins to recognize ihis. the 
sooner we can get back lo the 
important things, such as world 
peace.

Homosexually Speaking: 

Experimenting with sexuality OK 




Paul 
Tupper 



1 have a little tale to tell. 
Being the most recognized 
homosexual on campus, 1 con- 
stantly meet people, usually guys, 
who feel the need to tell me about 
their experiences This is fine with 
me. 1 love meeting new people 
and talking to them about any sub- 
ject. 1 especially enjoy talking 
aboul my favorite subject, sex. 
Recently this guy came (o me and 
s.iid. "Wt-ll I'm not gay. but I've 
had a homo- 
sexual experi- 
ence," 

My re- 
sponse was, 
"Oh really, 
what did you 
do. buy a belt 
and shoes that 
match?" 

After 
making this 
comment 1 
thought about 
what he'd said 
a little more. One conclusion I 
came to is that not everyone is as 
comfortable with their sexuality as 
I am I began to wonder what it 
would be like to be confused 
about yourself and be curious. I 
have heard stories before, but I 
can'i say that I relate. I have 
known that 1 was gay since I was a 
fetus. But not everyone has. 

Am I gay? Am I straight? Am I 
bisexual? I have found that many 
people struggle with this issue- 
Some even experiment with sex 
before ihey know the answer. 
Does this mean thai if you try gay 
sex that you are then mailed an 
"official gay" community card? 
Well. no. I think that you are con- 
fronting the issue rather than let- 
ling the tension build. Who's 
going to argue thai you are doing 
the wrong thing? 

What fascinates me is the lack 
of discussion about this subject. If 
this is happening as often as it 
seems, why don't we talk about 
this openly and show those who 
are having these feelings that the 



curiosity is normal, I know from 
experience that kids in ihcir teens 
experiment all the lime. Yet no 
one is willing to talk aboul it 

This experimeniation occurs 
not only in the straight communi- 
ty, but in the gay community as 
well. Many gays question their 
sexuality. I am very confident 
about who I am. but 1 recently 
came across a woman who I 
thought 1 might like to date. 
Imagine how startling this was for 
me. These feelings did not last 
long, bull felt them. 

So being confused and curious 
is normal. 

After making that slalemenl. I 
then began to wonder what hap- 
pens after the big deed is done. 
You catch yourself looking at 
members of the same sex' s bodies. 
You then decide to explore some 
different sexual options. You fmd 
a parmer willing lo help you with 
Ihc project and you actually go 
ihrough with it. Now what? 

Well, ihai answer is different 
for everyone For some, it's a 
homecoming This feels right and 
being gay is the way. But that's 
not always the case. Some com- 
plete the act wiih a sense of 
accomplishmenL They have done 
it and never want to do it again. I 
compare this to trying marijuana. 
You want lo even though every- 
one tells you it's wrong. 

In thinking about this whole 
topic. I learned something about 
myself and being gay in general. 
There is a choice involved wi[h 
sexuality, but it's not the one that 
the right-wing thinks gays make. 
The choice is to be happy with 
who you are. even if it means try- 
ing things you may not be com- 
fortable wi[h at firsL 

After all. even I have experi- 
mented with heterosexualily. 
Well, that is if you count sleeping 
with a straight guy.

Volleydons lose first MIVA match 



TME Co»v&gt;^«&gt;.ic^-ro« 



By S. Rranl Ktllty 
Fdiror-ln-Chier 

So uficn Ihi^ season, when ihc 
men's volleyball team looked 
ofiporiunily in the eye. ihey 
blinked. Thai was the story laM 
.Saiur(i,-)y night against Ohio Slate 
University (OSU). according lo 
IPFW coach Amie Ball. 

"It's Ihc same everywhere we 
go. We score a lot of poinLs and we 
give up a lot of points. We get to 

11. and we hag it. It was that way 
in game three, it was that way in 
game four We make a run and 
serve nut ol bounds, or we get to 

12. and we shank a pass, or...," Ball 
said. 

IPFW won the Tirst game against 
OSU, but lost die next three to suf- 
fer its first MIVA loss this year. 15- 

13. 7-15. 10-15. 12-15 in front of 
1060 fans at the Gates Center. 

"It was not a pretty volleyball 
match. It was a game wc could 
have won." commented Ball. 

The Volleydons scored the last 
five points of ihe firel game to win 
it, 15-13, OSU failed to score on 
three straight possessions in that 
span. IPFW registered a .324 kill 
percentage for the game. 



OSU coach Pele Hanson said. 
"Wc had chances to win, and we 
kind of let it (the first game) slip 
through our fingers." 

In each of the final two games, 
the Volleydons tied ihc score 
halfway during the game or later, 
only to be cut short of ihe final 
points. 

For the second game. OSU 
killed 50 percent of its aliempis. 
IPFW suricd the game with a 5-3 
lead, dien the Buckeyes scored the 
next six points, IPFW came back 
within two. ai 7-9, before OSU put 
the game away with the final sn 
points. 

The Volleydons began game 
three with a 4-0 lead before being 
out-scored 7-1 for a 5-7 deficit. 
They scored the next iwo points, 
then OSU ran the score again to 12- 
7. The two icams fought a see-saw 
battle before the Buckeyes wcti, 15- 
10. 

OSU jumped oul to a 4-0 lead in 
the fourth game, but IPFW scored 
the next five points, llie game was 
lied again at seven when OSU ran 
off four straight points to lead 1 1-7, 
The Volleydons came within two 
again at 12-10. but could get no 
closer as OSU scored the final point 



on a service ace. 

"The second, third, and fourth 
games, I thought Fort Wayne's 
passing was jusi so in-and-out .,. 
They really struggled with their 
offense," said Hanson. 

Ball agreed. "Our passing was 
awful, so we're running all over the 
place," he said. Later he added con- 
cerning Ihe Volleydons' offense, 
"We had only 14 kills out of our 
two middles," 

Hanson said. "Nobody was in a 
good side-out rhyihm, I thought our 
kids served the ball pretty well; wc 
made some service errors, bui we 
served pretty tough at limes." 

Hanson also said his team took 
advantage of the Juggled lineup in 
which Ricardo Soler continued to 
play sener for ihe Volleydons, "We 
knew that with Amie's new system 
with having taken Ricardo oul of 
the passing, |they wcrcl going to 
struggle a little bil," he said. 

"Wc tried to see who was going 
well, and then finally we just said. 
'Hey let's take it lo 'Pepe [Felipe 
Ralal] and see if he can handle it,' 
and he did okay, but there were 
limes he stniggled." added Hanson. 

Opposite Craig Collins led 
IPFW with 25 kills on a 23 percent 



pace and added 10 digs. Outside 
hitter Ralai added 16 kilts while 
freshman Justin Luna added II. 
The Volleydons killed just 24 per- 
cent of their aitcmpts. 

While service errors arc down. 
Ball said he wants to see tougher 
serving out of his offense, "Our 
serving is not aggressive enough, 
The errors are down, but it's still 
too easy." he said. 

Outsidc hitter Steve Potter paced 
Ihe Buckeyes with 23 kills while 
teammate Jose Bengoa had 22 kills 
and eight errors oui of 39 attempts 
for a ,359 hitting percentage OSU 
hit for 33 percent while they dug 40 
spikes on defense, 

Hanson commented, "I thought 
our defense was okay. It could have 
been better. I thought we ,,, kind of 
phased in and out, 1 didn't think we 
were really, truly mentally in every 
game. But wc were in for stretches 
long enough to where we could 
keep some good diings going," 

OSU took its record above ,500 
lo 7-6. 4-1 in the MIVA. while 
IPFW dropped to 6-8. 3-1. 

"Jose (Bengoa] helps a hell of a 
lot, when we got him on the coun 
we're a competitive team with a lot 
of people." said Hanson,

Screaming Eagles sweep 
IPFW basketball teams 



By S. Brant KcUey 

Edllor-In-Chler 

You can shoot loo much, you 
can dribble too much and you can 
pass too much, but you can never 
rebound too much. This is a lesson 
Ihe IPFW men's basketball leam 
periodically forgets while playing 
games in the GLVC, 

The Mastodons were out- 
rebounded, 43-23, in a 98-90 loss to 
fourth-ranked University of 
Southern Indiana (USD before 
4.000 fans at The Physical 
Aciiviiies Center in Evansville. 

IPFW men's coach Andy Piazza 
said, "They |USI) are very big, very 
physical." 

In the fif^t game, the Lady 'Dons 
scared USI by closing the game 
from an 11-poini half-iime deficit 



before falling, 77-72. IPFW lead 
until Ihe last minute-and-a-half, 
in Ihe first half when USl's press 
took over. 

"They pressed us at the end [of 
die {\n\ half] and wc just fell apart 
.., the press really hurt us," said 
IPFW coach Pam Bowden. 

In a game marred by 3S 
turnovers and poor field-goal shoot- 
ing, the Screaming Eagles used 
three -point shooting on the outside 
and LeAnn Freeland on the inside 
to pull away from IPFW for a viclo- 
ry- 

Freeland sosured the glass for 15 
rebounds and USI bit eight three- 
pointers in the game. 

IPFW was led by guard Lindy 
Jones with 17 points. Forward 
Doilie Porch added 14 points to go 
with a team-high 10 rebounds. The 



leam grabbed 51 boards, eight more 
than USI, and shot 85 percent from 
the charily stripe . 

Guard Missy Hart led the 
Screaming Eagles with a career- 
high 30 poinis by hitting 11 of 21 
field-goal attempts. "She [Harlj

lU analyst warru against man- 
aged healthcare 

Physicians may be forced to act 
as "double agents" if the trend 
toward managed health care contin- 
ues, warns lU health policy analyst 
Marc Rodwin in the upcoming 
issue of The New England Journal 
of Medicine. The trend toward 
managed care and the role of case 
managers in health care delivery 
may pose multiple and conflicting 
goals for patients and physicians. 
Unlike indemnity insurance and the 
fee for service that traditionally 
defined health care delivery, the 
trend toward managed care, includ- 
ing HMO's. PPOs and point of ser- 
vice care, may put physicians in 
the role of trying to aa on behalf of 



patients while adhering lo cost con- 
tammcnt guidelines and protocols 
dictated by a managed care organi- 
zation, 

Rodwin says public policy 
should encourage development of 
professional norms and legal oblig- 
ations for case managers as "a 
countervailing force to interests 
which favor managed care organi- 
zations over patients." Rodwin dis- 
cussed these issues yesterday at the 
American College of Physicians 
Leadership Conference in 
Washington, D.C.

kets." said IPFW coacb Andy 

Ryan Bond led IPFW's attack
