Attempts to unionize the IPFW 
faculty were strengthened at a recent 
informational meeting of the 
American Federation of Teachers. 

The meeting, called by Mark 
Crouch, associate professor of labor 
studies, was held Monday, Oct. 2fj, in 
Walb Memorial Union 112 and drew 24 
faculty members from 13 different 
departments. ^ 

Facility tenure was high on the^hst 
of grievances. Sociology Professor Pat 
Ashton. who introduced himself as 
"one of the eight who was denied 
tenure," said he had been recom- 
mended for tenure unanimously by his 
department and unit, and supported 
by the dean of Arts and Letters before 
being denied by the campus-wide 
committee. 

Ashton's record was then examined 
by an outside panel of eight indi- 
viduals, including professors at 
Cornell, the Stale University of New 
York at Stony Brook, two former 
presidents of the American Socio- 
logical Association and the chair 6f 
the sociology department at Columbia 
University. 

"The panel voted unanimously that 
my record was worthy of tenure but 
Chancellor Thomas Wallace |aid if he 
gave me tenure it would looK like he 
caved in because Pat Ashton got all 
his friends lo write in," Ashton said. 

"We tlien went with an anonymous 
panel ot four reviewers. We never 
heard from one so we went with three 
The Chancellor said these reviews 
were strong but not quite positive 
enough." continued Ashton. 

Ashton considers his ease a violation 



of faculty and employee rights. Gerald 
Houseman of the political science de- 
partment said (he Ashton case was a 
"gross miscarriage of justice." 

Wallace said last Thursday night 
that Ashton's case was a "person- 
nelmatter" and declined to answer 
Ashton's remarks The Chancellor also 
declined to comment on the meeting 
itself, saying "I don't know anything 
about It." 

Others at the meeting complained 
that campus decision-making w:is 
being done by the adminisiraium 
alone instead of by the faculty and 
administration. "The factory model is 
here at IPFW." said Peter iadicola, 
sociology professor. 

Engineering Professor At Pugh said 
the faculty in his department was 
losing control over the engineering 
curriculum, "We're pressured by 
people who couldn't make it in our 
courses, to teach courses (hat no ac- 
crediting agency would let us teach," 
Pugh said 

French professor Marthe Rosenfcid 
said she saw the administration as 
"hierarchic, witli no room for 
controversy or debate" which was 
leading to "an atmosphere of fear " 
Rosenfeld also said the administration 
was giving "short-shrift" to programs 
drawing fewer students such as 
woman's studies and was emphasizing 
"job training over questioning and 
Itiinking," 

Sociology professor Mike 
Nusbaumer said, "fn my 20 year as- 
sociation with this university what 
disturbs me most is long term con- 
cerns take a back seat lo individual 
administrative careers." 

But not everyone blamed .the ad- 



Textbook sale proposed 
in Senate legislation 



ff Bill S788-N passes in the Student 
Senate, Folletl's Bookstore could be in 
for some competition. 

The bill, introduced by Internal Af- 
fairs Committee member Forbes 
Mcintosh, at the Wednesday, Oct, 28, 
Student Senate meeting, would es- 
tabhsh a used liooksale every 
semester. 

Under the bill, students wishing to 
sell tiooks would write their name and 
the price of the book on an envelope 
which would be left inside the book. 
Students buying the book would leave 
the money in the envelope and the 
envelope with the sales clerk running 
the sale. 

Both the envelopeis) containing the 



money and any unsold book(s) could 
be picked up by sellers at the Stu- 
dents' Government office at the end of 
the sale. 

The sale would be held from I to 6 
p.m. on the two consecutive weekdays 
before the start of a new semester as 
well as the first two consecutive 
weekdays during the semester. 

While no senator present opposed 
the bill, the piece of legislation ran 
into trouble when senators found 
ambiguities. Senator Robert Bishop 
asked what would happen if a seller 
did not pick up the money Senator 
Jeff Pieper asked how the bill 
would handle the problem of books 
that would not be used during the next 
semester. 

An improved version of the bill is 
expected soon. 




ministration. Communication Profes- 
sor Richard Hess said "One reason 
why the collegia! model doesn't work 
is because commillec chairs don't 
stand up for their decisions." 

Criticism lor the faculty not doing 
anything was also brought up by AFT 
representatives Gayle Pluta and Mike 
Parsons. 

Parsons, an assistant professor of 



labor studies at IU-61oomington. said 
many faculty viewed unions as organ- 
izations for manual laborers that 
protect the mediocre, or are controlled 
by mobsters. 

History Professor Louis Cantor said, 
"I'm trying to encourage Ph.d.'s to do 
what blue-collar workers learned in 
the 19th century— organize to protect 
themselves "

Workshop highlights 
vital skills, speakers 



Writing and communication were said to be the most important skills 
students can develop for their future in the work force during a Professional 
Women's Career Panel on Business, Human Relations, and Computer 
Technology, 

Featuring Brcnda Fishbaugh, Marion Mason-Coufoudakis, and Lynn 
Rogers, the workshop was sponsored by the Women's Cenler, 

Rogers opened the workshop with information about her educational back- 
ground and her present position as Scientific Programmer Analyst for 
Magnavox Government and Industrial Electronics Corporation. She ts em- 
ployed in the engineering department, where the majority of her co-workers 
are men. 

Rogers graduated from IFPW in 1985 with a Bachelor of Science Degree 
computer technology. She said the knowledge she acquired as a student al 
IPFW has proved useful to her in her present position. She also emphasized 
the necessity for good communication and writing skills. 

Coufoudakis is a self-employed physician's consultant for Mason and As- 
sociates, a company which she formed. She holds a degree in English from 
the University of Michigan and has done some posl-graduale work at Oberlin 
College. She worked eight years as a leacher (hen quit to become a full-time 
mother. 

Upon returning to the work force. Coufoudakis knew she did not want to be 
a leacher. Being undecided, she accepted a part-lime position as a volunteer. 
Someone noticed her potential for another position and encouraged her in this 
direction. Subsequently, she worked as a researcher, freelancer, and 
consultant before Iwginning her own company. 

As the future does not always go as planned, Coufoudakis strongly 
recommends students work toward acquiring a lit&gt;eral arts education so as 
not to restrict oneself to any particular area. This leaves options open for 
later on She also fell it besLto prepare for the future by getting a part-lime 
job or volunteer work in areas of interest to the individual. This, she felt, 
would be useful experience when applying for a position. 

The following suggestions were given to those entering the work force: 

—find out what you're worth on the job market. 

—learn how to negoliate what you're worth in the job market. 

—review catalogs on starting salaries. Talk to ^e men and women in a 
particular Held to get feedback. 

—be willing lo start out low but be flexible; however, don't be willing to 
stay low forever. 

—create the next rung on the ladder if there isn't one. 

—recognize growth patterns. Personal and career goals work hand in hand 
It's important lo^now you can't have it all, so decide what is most important 
al that time. 

—don't ignore the needs of the complete person. There's more to life than 
working al a job: maintain a balance between work, family and recreation or 
hobbies. 

Fishbaugh graduated from IPFW in 1979 with a degree in marketing 
management She has worked for NCR and Computerland before acquiring 
her present position as manager of Olsten Temporary Services, 

Below are a number of suggestions she offered on how to get ahead in the 
business world: 

—keep a file of all accomplishments. 

—attend workshops, conferences, etc. 

—pick a couple of areas where networking is possible. 

-keep options open. Most people never wind up doing what they had 
originally planned, 

—pick an area which matches individual personalities. People who do Otis 
acquire the attitude that they love to go to work. 

-don't forget to be feminine. 

All three women on the panel agreed that applicants should screen a 
prospective company tiefore applying for a position.

Booksale issue raises 
questions and concerns 



Current legisialion in the Sludent 
Senate at IPFW surrounds the de- 
velopment of a used booksale which 
would be controlled and ran by 
Students' Government. 

Concerns have been raised over 
this bill and the benefits of the sale 
should be pointed out if the bill is to 
pass 

Competition with Folletfs Book- 
store is a major aspect. The book- 
store has a contract with IPFW. 
but every semester students can be 
heard complaining and worrying 
over textbook costs. To be honest, a 
Students' Government booksale 
might not create as much competi- 
tion for Folletfs as one might 
predict. 

Many students currently ad- 
vertise and sell their own texts, 
utilising tbe bulletin board in the 
hallway by the bookstore at Ketller 
Hall These students don't lake a 
significant chunk out of Folletfs 
profits and they would most likely 
be first to sell their books through 
the Students' Government sale. 
Those students who normally shop 
at Folletfs would most likely con- 
tinue to do so, and those who use 
credit cards definitely would, out of 
necessity. 

Another concern, which was 
voiced at the Wednesday, Oct, 28. 
Sludent Senate meeting, addressed 
the possibility of students not pick- 
ing up money from sold textbooks 
What student would go to the trou- 
ble of putting the text up for 
sale— then not collect the money? 



This is an unlikely situation, and 
if it were to occur, the money could 
be placed into an account, and a 
record made of the student's name, 
the amount, the book sold, and to 
whom it was sold. This ledger could 
then be stored with any un- 
collected, unsold texts; 

This would facilitate the process 
if a student were to return a year 
later and demand money for a text. 
The bookkeeper could check the 
records and pay the student any 
money due. or find and return to 
the student the unsold text. 

Another problem raised was the 
handling of books not being used 
during the semester. This is simply 
solved, because a student would 
realize that just as Folletfs will not 
buy back a book not being used, 
neither would a student. 

However, some students may 
purchase such books for reference. 
Nursing, dental and engineering 
texts are just some examples of 
books that could contain charts and 
other useful information Reference 
texts are also good re-sellers. 

There is a need for such a book- 
sale at IPFW and there are prob- 
lems to be ironed out. If Students' 
Government dedicates themselves 
to writing a sound bill and creating 
a workable outline for the sale, 
then the IPFW student body will 
certainly benefit. 

Bravo to the Student Senators 
responsible for bringing this idea to 
a vote.

As reported in your ar- 
ticle Inst week, the Senate 
did vole lo change Die name 
of the StudenI Union Board 
ot Governors to Ihe Stu-

(he article did not explain

The Students' Activities

Mlion, which is lo coor- 
dinate Ihe social and cul- 
tural activities oF Students'

The major theme of your 
article, which David Benson 
described as faculty eval- 
uations, was the best ex- 
ample of a reporter miS' 
construing events and 
statements that I have ever 
read. The actual topic was 
faculty/course evaluations. 
Mr. Benson also staled thai 
Ihey would t&gt;e used for Stu- 
dents' GovernmenI to take 
a position on faculty tenure 
cases. Students' Govern- 
menI has not, to my knowl- 
edge, ever laken a position 
on faculty tenure cases, nor 
do we have immediate 
plans lo do so. Whal I 
slated was that faculty may 
wish to use Ihe evaluations 
to support their cases (or 
tenure. 

The two quotes slated in 
the article by myself and 
Vice President Phil Downs 
did nol h^ve any news- 
worthy significance, except 
for Iheir sensationalism. 



and should nol have lx«n 
mdudcd in the slory. 

If the faculty/course 
evaluations are lo become a 
reality al IPnV. Students' 
Government will need not 
only Ihe "blessing" of Ihe 
(acuity bul also their coop- 
eration. It is untorlunaie 
Ihat a project o( such im- 
porlance lo the IPFW stu-

only concerned with creat- 
ing sensationalism.

Editor's Nole: 

In response lo your letter. 
The Communicator would 
like lo stress that several 
attempts were made to 
contact the Athletic De- 
partment to no avail. 

In addition, we often do 
not research tetters because 
they are generally not un- 
provoked. Most students 
who wrile letters do so t&gt;e- 
cause a situation has 
prompted them lo do so It 
IS their opinion, not ours. 
We also do nol have the 



right lo edit (except (or 
brevity or clarity! or with- 
hold letters. And we cannot 
research a letter written by 
a sludent, we can merely 
present Ihe student's views. 
We are nol responsible (or 

the Editor that are not a 
resuH of typographical er- 
rors. We regret, however. 
that an inaccurate yiew was 
presented. 



Students disgusted 
with book prices 

To Ihe Editor: 

I, along with other stu- 
dents, am very disgusted at 
the cost of books that are 
resold al the bookstore on 
campus. 1 realize that 
Folletfs Bookstore needs to 
make a profit lo maintain 
it, but nol al the students' 



expense of over-pr(ced used 

In the past year. I have 
purchased books twice that 
were several semesters old, 
and I noticed I paid more 
for a used book than the 
original cost It is a shame 
that I (and other students) 
have lo pay a higher price, 
for a book Ihat was used al 
least three or moreilimes. !■ 
think the bookstore is tak-' 
ing advantage of students 
because Folletfs knows we 
are in need of those twoks 

0( course, when I try to 
resell my books to Foliett's, 
I find out Ihat sometimes 
the store will not rebuy 
them, t&gt;ecause it has no 
further use for them. Al one 
time, I received S7 back for 
■ a iKwk I purchased new al 
$35, There was not a 
scratch or a tear in Ihe en- 
tire book That same book 
was sold (or $28, which was 
a four-time mark up. That 
was outrageous and sense- 



less. Most businesses that 
are in economic dealings 
for profit, only double the 
cost ol merchandise. That 
two-time mark up covers 
employees' wages, utHities, 
and all overhead plus a 
profit. It would be inter- 
esting to know how much 
profit the store makes for 
one semester on resold 
books. -,■:_. I &lt;-, . _. 

Just because some o( the 
students receive pell grants, 
student loans, or tiecause 
the student's parents may 
let them use their charge 
cards, that does nol give the 
store the right to lake ad- 
vantage of the students by 
charging such a high cost 
for used ijooks. 1. with other 
students backing me up. am 
tired of this endless situa- 
tion and something should 
be done about it Indiana- 
Purdue tries to give the 
students an advantage lo a 
better future by permitting 



us to live o(( campus. This 
advantage saves them 
money, while the book store 
tries to rob them with the 
high cost o( used books. I 
feel there is no fairness in 
their dealings. I do not 
resell my books t&gt;ack to 
Foliett's Bookstore any- 
more I loan them to other 
students who are in need of 
them, or keep them for my 
own reference file I will not 
let the bookstore insult my 
intelligence. 

Please witlihold my name 
(rom this tetter since the 
manager of the store is a 
neighbor o( mine.

the start of the campaign, 
Admiral Thor Hanson, 
president and chief execu- 
live officer of the National 
Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
stated: "College stutlents 
have become a significant 
force in the fight against 
M.S. and have made it their 
personal cause This year, 
we're going all out to sup- 
port their efforts in any \vay 

Throughout the 19B7-88 
school year, and especially 
in February - "Bust MS 
Month" - college students 
will be involved in a variety 
of fund-raising and educa- 
tional activities geared to- 
ward increasing the public's 
awareness of multiple 
sclerosis, and establishing 
long-term fund-raising 
support for the National 
Multiple Sclerosis Society. 

SAMS will kick-off this 
year of fund raising with 
"Skip-A-Meal for M.S.," a 



-day 

whereby students skip a 
meal and the cost of that 
meal is donated to help 
fight MS Last year, the top 
fund-raising campus, SUNY 
Binghamton, raised S9.0D0 
through the no-cost event. 

Another event is "Rock 
Alike." a lany. lip-synch 
competition in which stu- 
dents impersonate their fa- 
vorite rock stars to raise 
money for MS, The lop re- 
gional Rock Alikes will ap- 
pear in a national contest 
broadcast on MTV Music 
Television. 

Other fund raising ac- 
tivities include canning 
drives, sweatshirt sales, 
balloon launches, dance-a- 
thons. and movie parties. 

While the real incentive is 
helping the estimated quar- 
ter of a million Americans 
who have multiple sclerosis.

ing the 



most money at the end of 
the campaign will be fea- 
tured in an on-campus pro- 
gram to be broadcast live 
on MTV. Recognition 
awards will also tie given to 
other top fund raising 
campuses nationwide. 

For the first time this 
year, SAMS will also pre- 
sent an award to the cam- 
pus that conducts the l&gt;est 
education program A panel 
of judges will determine the 
winner based on the most 
effect 



Students are en- 
couraged to write articles 
for newspapere, arrange for 
speaker-on-campus, and 
coordinate symposia to ed- 
ucate their campus and 
community at&gt;out M.S. too. 

Since 1985, SAMS has 
grown from 12 midwestern 
colleges to close to 200 
campuses, involving thou- 
santis of students across the 
country in the fight against 
M.S. SAMS has also re- 
ceived the enthusiastic en- 
dorsement of major cor- 
porations such as Ford 
Motor Company, F\iji Film, 
and Swatch; well-known 
celebrities including Cyndi 
Lauper. Brooke Shields, and 
NBC weatherman Witlard 
Scott; and many national 
student organizations. 

Directing the program on 
campus affords SAMS 
Chairpersons the unique 
opportunity to receive col- 
lege credits while develop- 
ing skills in leadership, or- 
ganization and manage- 
ment, and gaming valuable 
business experience through 
exposure to marketing, 
public relations and special 
events planning.

Horrors 



Gore too unrealistic to contribute depth to plot 



Director John Carpenter 
has finally come baci( to 
what he does best— horror 
films-and ■Princ. of 
Darkness" is his lalcst 
venture. 



REVIEW 



Carpenter, who also 
directed such classics as 
"The Thing, " "The Fog" 
and the trend ::ct ting "Hal- 
loween," has crafted this 
intellectually stimulating 
yet horrifying story of 
Satan's attempt to re- 
establish his throne on 
earth via his child, who is 
presently incarnating him- 
self in the basement of an 
abandoned church. 



The film worits on two 
levels. First is the level of 
shock: things jump out at 
you, and people arc killed in 
■ strange ways. The second 
level is the real story level. 

The story is of a 
priest— played by Donald 
PIcasance ( "Halloween" 
and "Halloween Hi— who 
is last in the long line of 
■■The Brotherhood of 
Sleep," the only ones who 
know of this vat of green 
stuff in the basement of the 
church. The priest realizes 
that this val of stuff is 
starting lo act up and de- 
cides to bring m a men- 
agerie of college students to 
find out exactly what it is. 
This is where the slory 
gains inlelleclual momen- 
tum 

The child of Satan, it 



seems, is telepalhically 
controlling the actions of 
the weak of the world- 
— from bugs lo Alice 
Cooper, who plays a street 
person. But while he is con- 
trolling the thoughts of the 
worms, some other force 
(people in the future l&gt;eam- 
ing warnings lo us&gt; is con- 
trolling the dreams of the 
intellectuals who are in the 
church. 

■'Prince of Darkness" 
does a good job of present- 
ing smarl-sounding stuff 
without it sounding like B,S, 
to those who know about 
such things as differential 
equations and the Babylon 
Mystery tieligion. However,

pletely skeptical character

1 personally could have 
done without the things 
jumping out from every- 
where, and 1 also would 
have liked to have seen a 
little more plot develop- 
ment, a little greater dra- 
matic Irony, and a little 
better make-up job on the 
Satan child.

at Glenbrook last week. 
When I saw it. before school 
started, it was slow— not as 
much as "Hellraiser" mind 
you— but it lacked the same 
essential pace. 

I began to wonder if they 
had to re-cut it; or. per- 
haps, I had accidentally 
gone into Ihe wrong theatre 
and seen some other semi- 
thhlling teenage vampire 
flick. ...but, alas. no. it was 
the selfsame film that 
stimulated my senses only 
when the vampiress-lo-be, 
Jami Gcrtz. popped up on 
the screen and the two or 
three times the .soundtrack 
ventured into a tray's choir 
singing, "I shall not want." 

Well, the best answer I 
could come up with is that 
it was the best of the teen- 
oriented Fall movies Like, 
if it were up against, say, 
"Fast Times ul Ridgcmont 
High," it wouldn't have 
been around past Rosh 



Kashana.

and naive mother of Jason 
Patrick ("Stand by Mc"i. 
and Circ Peldman. but all 
in all. the film was basic- 
ally predictable with few, 
few, but some, surprises, 

I will say, though, that I 
had fun during a few parLs, 
but at the end I couldn't l&gt;e-

to the downfall o( the IPFW 
soccer learn. 2-1, against 
the visiting Toledo Univer- 
sity Rockets on Thursday, 
Oct. 29, 

Three limes in the first 
half the Dons bounced a 
shot off the cross bar of the 
goal mouth and once had a 
header just miss. In the 
second half the Rockets 
goalie twice knocked shots 
by the Dons over the top 
bar and made a save on 
another shot by the 
Mastodons. 

For Ihe first time this 
season the Dons oulshot 
their opponent, IPFW to- 
taled 23 shots on goal to the 



Rockets' six and led at 
halftime in shots taken, 11 
to six. Comer kicks were 
also in favor of the host 
school, five to one. 

In a surprise move. Coach 
Bronn Pfeiffer pulled his 
regular goalie, Junior Kevin 
Mann, about halfway 
through the first half and 
FYeshman Jason Plank took 
over the net minding duties, 
recording two saves. 

Toledo took a 2-0 lead on 
two first-half goats. The 
Rockets' Emilio Duran 
scored at the 39:43 mark 
and Tim Kill added another 
for the Rockets with 23:51 
left lo ptay in the period. 
The Dons' lally was by 
Jerry Jenkins with 23:51 
left in the game. 

"We need more scoring 
from our forwards." said 
Pfeiffer. "We just can't get 
the ball in the net and 
haven't had a goal scored 
by a fonvard since last 
Forwards are what 
I'll be recruiting for next 
year."

She may not be a rose 
among thorns but she is one 
of a kind. She is Cathy 
Wellman and she is the lone 
female member of the 
IPFW cross country team. 

The Mastodon freshman 
ran both cross country and 
track at DeKalb High 
School, Her interest in run- 
ning was fostered by other 
members ot her family 

"My two older brothers 
and my sister ran and my 
sister went to slate so I 
started running," she 

Wellman was introduced 
to the IPFW cross country 
program and to Coach Mike 
Kasl last spring at the 
Northrop Girl's Track Sec- 
tional. Wellman. who was 
running in the 3ZO0 meters. 
was introduced by a friend 
to Kast 

It sounds like a mutual 
admiration society meeting 
when Ihe coach and the 
runner talk about each 
other, 

"Kalhy has really per- 
formed well as a freshman. 
She has finished in the top 
half in a number ot meets 
she has ran in and there are 
a lot of good gal runners out 
there." said Kast. 

"He is the t&gt;est coach I've 
ever had. He's taught me 
all about running and tech- 
niques that 1 never knew. I 
have improved so much 
because of him," Wellman 
said ol Kast. 

Kast has been trying for 
the past two seasons to 
start a girl's team in cross 
country at IPFW with very 
little luck. Two girls beside 
Wellman showed an interest 
at the beginning of the sea- 
son but did not follow 
through. 

Wellman takes part in all 
of the women's meets even 
though she is usually run- 
ning against a full squad of 



girls from the other schools. 
She also cheers on the 
IPFW men runners at the 
meets. Kast refers to her as 
the team's mascot. 

As far as the relationship 
between Wellman and the 
male meml&gt;eni of the team: 
"These guys are so nice, 
Ihey don't even try to in- 
timidate you." 

Wellman has a full 
schedule. Along with run- 
ning cross country and at- 
tending IPFW, she also 
works at the Kentucky 
Fried Chicken restaurant in 
Auburn. She is also a good 
student, having finished 




Calhy Wellmi 



near the top of her class at 
DeKalb. and according to 
Kasl, she is doing very well 
in her classes here at 
IPFW 

Some people may have 
trouble with a schedule that 
busy, bul Wellman seems to 
have things in perspective: 
"School is first, my job is 
second and running is 
third," 

As far as being a part of 
the cross country team, 
Wellman says, "It's a lot of 
fun and the guys are great. 
It's not so much hard work 
as it is the satisfaction of 
knowing you're doing your 
best,"
