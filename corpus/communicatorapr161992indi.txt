NEWS BRIEFS 

TYPEWRITERS REMOVED AFTER 
MASTURBATION INCIDENTS 

After two reported incidents of a man ejaculating 
on typewriters in Helmke Library typing rooms, 
typing privileges for students will be eliminated, 
according to Judy Violette, assistant librarian. 

Campus police have no leads as to who may have 
been responsible. A report, filed on March 19, 
stated "an unknown male ejaculated onto a type- 
writer in 341c at Helmke Library. May have 
occurred between 10 p.m. and 12 a.m." 

Violette said the typewriters will be given to stu- 
dent government. "Perhaps they can monitor their 
use better than we have been able to," Violette 
said. 

The incidents, occurring within the last six 
months have caused damage to the machines and 
will force the library to use its limited funds for 
cleaning of the typewriters. 

"Cleaning the typewriters will be an expensive 
proposition," said Violette. This, along with 
decreased usage of the typewriters, has prompted 
library officials to close the rooms permanently, 
said Violette. 

Most students have turned lo using computers 
now available in the library rather than typewriters 
anyway, said Violette. 

IPFW FACULTY ACHIEVE 
PROMOTIONS, TENURE 

Several IPFW faculty have reached a new rung on 
the career ladder; 17 have been promoted or 
tenured, or both this spring.The trustees of Indiana 
and Purdue Universities approved the actions. 

The faculty members promoted to full professor- 
ship are: Dipak Chowdhury, geosciences; 
Lawrence Friedman, English; Zoher Shipchandler. 
management and marketing; and Frank PaJadino, 
biology. 

Professors granted tenure are: Bronislaw Misztal, 
professor of sociology; Audrey Ushenko, associate 
professor of fine arts; and Carlos Pomalaza-Raez, 
associate professor of engineering. 

Tenure and promotion to associate professor sta- 
tus was granted to seven individuals: Scott Argast, 
geosciences; Rodney Farnsworth, English; 
AnnMarie LeBlanc, fine arts; Judith Eichenauer, 
nursing; Thomas Laverghetta. electrical engineer- 
ing; Samir Sayegh, physics; and C. Wayne Unsell, 
civil and architectural engineering technology. 

The rank of associate professor was achieved by 
three other individuals: Jane Grant, public and 
environmental affairs; Dyne Pfeffenberger. 
accounting; and Lucille Hess, audiotogy and 
speech sciences. 

IPFW STUDENTS BREATHE EASIER 
WITH VENTILATION IMPROVEMENT 

Modifications made to Classroom Medical 
Building to control the air flow problems appear to 
be solving the problem, reported Don Katter, direc- 
tor of the Physical Plant. 

A continuous flow of fresh air has been achieved 
by the placement of regulators on the thermostat 
boxes. This allows a healthier amount of oxygen 
into the rooms, according to Katter. 

The rooms in question have been found to have 
carbon dioxide levels between 200 and 800 parts 
per million. The accepted level is 600 parts per 
million. Further adjustments to the regulators 
should put the rooms at 600 or below, according to 
Katter. 

The university plans to begin the modifications in 
the rest of the building as soon as the needed parts 
come in, said Katter. The changes should be done 
before the summer session starts, Katter concluded.

Senate members upset with lack of action 



By Chad Hesting 

Managing Editor 

IPFWs siudcni senate 

resumed ihcir regular meeting 
schedule on April 9, after poor 
senator attendance forced the 
cancellation of four weekly 
meetings. 

Eight senators aiicndcd the 
meeting, while Tivc were abscnL 
The number required for a vot- 
ing quorum is seven. 

The resignation of two student 
senators has reduced the list of 
active student senators to 13. 
Chad Downey and Sccmab 
Rashccd resigned their positions 
last week, according to siudcni 



body president Kristina Frazicr- 
Henry. 

Impeachment proceedings 
scheduled for April 10 were can- 
celled ai the senate meeting. 
Frazier-Henry announced that 
IPSGA's executive branch 
would not initiate hearings 
against student senators and 
Student Activities Board with 
poor attendance records this 
semester. 

Instead, the senators debated a 
proposed amendment to the 
IPSGA constitution that would 
set an absence limiL Among the 
provisions suggested for the 
amendment were: 



1. After a third absence, the 

senator would receive a written 
warning. After a founh absence, 
removal from the senate would 
be automatic. 

2. A permanent meeting time 
would be sci. 

"(I'm) ashamed of being 
on senate lately," 
-Victoria Vinson 



3. Both excused and unexcused 
absences would be counted 
toward a senator's total. 

4. A senator with more than 
four absences would be allowed 



to give an explanation before the 
senate. The senate then could 
vote to allow him to stay. 

Senators voiced (heir disap- 
pointment at the halt of senate 
activities because of attendance 
problems. Victoria Vinson said 
that she was "ashamed of being 
on senate lately," 

Robcn Murray expressed frus- 
tration at a senate with more 
than half its seats empty. The 
IPSGA constitution allows for 
20 senators, 

"I'm glad the senate finally 
made quorum," said Frazier- 
Henry. "When ihc senate is able 
to get rid of its inactive mem- 



bers, it can get some business 
done." 

Other senate business: The stu- 
dent senate unanimously passed 
a resolution condemning the 
IPFW administration's lab fee 



In the resolution, the senate 
calls the increase "unjustified." 
Because the lab fees go into a 
general fund, the senate believes 
not enough of the money is 
rctumed to buy supplies for lab 
classes. 

The resolution was written and 
sponsored by Murray.

News Editor 

Construction workers from 
Hoagland Electric ruptured a 
one-eighth-inch gas line while 
attempting to lay phone lines for 
the new emergency telephones. 

The leak occurred on April 14. 
at approximately 2 p.m., accord- 
ing to police reports. 

A few officers from campus 
police secured die area, and NIP- 
SCO was notified, according to 
SgL Tom Haner. 

"It only look ihem one hour 
from the time NIPSCO was noti- 
fied lo when we were up and 
running again. NIPSCO was 
notified at 2; 1 0. and it was fixed 
by 3:10." said Haner. 

Nobody was overcome by 
fumes, and there were no 
casualties. 

'There was. however, a strong 
odor around Kcttlcr Hall. You 
could tell it was natural gas," 
said Haner. 

"We were worried about it at 
first. We were afraid someone 



Police install phones for increased safety 



By Janet Ausbury 
Staff Writer 

Eleven emergency phones 
located on campus will be fully 
operational by April 22, accord- 
ing to SgL Lauren Dcnhartog of 
Police and Safety. 

Five of the phones will be fully â–  
installed and functional by April 
16. These phones are located in 
Lot 3, Lot 4, between Lois 4 and 
5, Lot 6, between Lots 8 and 9, 
and Lot 7. The other phones 
will be installed by the April 22 
deadline. 

The emergency phones will 
cost the university approximate- 
ly S46,3S0 for parts and installa- 
tion. "The university tried lo get 
a real good unit," said 
I&gt;enhanog of the phones. "These 
are some of the best units 
made," 

Paul Strouts, interim director 
of Police and Safety, said, "This 
is something Police and Safety 
wanted to do, and they first 
started talking about it a couple 
of years ago." Strouts noted that 
the project has laken about a 
year and a half to be completed. 



The phones have a push button 
and a speaker. When the button 
is pushed, a blue snobc light on 
top of the phone will come on 
and the extension will light up 
on Police and Safety's phone 
system to show die exact loca- 
tion of thecal!. 

The speaker can pick up 
sounds from 20 feel away and 
will remain on for two to tiirec 
minutes after the button is 
pushed. 

The new phone system will be 
publicized in the next quarteriy 
crime sialistics report issued by 
Police and Safety. Denhariog 
said the report will contain 
instructions for using the 
phones. 

Denhariog said that for non- 
emergency situations, regular 
campus phones should be used, 
but Police and Safety will not 
take action against anyone using 
the emergency phones for non- 
emergencies. 

"It's a question of safety," 
Denhariog said. "If it's 8 or 9 ui 
night, would you be safer using 
an emergency phone or walking 



all the way back to a building to 
use a campus phone?" 

Denhariog said students who 
abuse the phones would be 
brought before the Dean of 
Students. Police and Safety 
would then talk to the prosecu- 
tor's office about fihng charges. 

The phones are Police and 
Safety's latest step to increase 
safety on campus. "We're work- 
ing more from ihe standpoini of 
prevention (of crime)," said 
Dcnhartog. 

Dcnhartog said that as the cam- 
pus continues to expand, more 
phones will probably be 
installed. 

If a phone is found not to be 
working. Police and Safety 
should be notified immediately. 
They will be testing the phones 
weekly lo ensure that they arc 
working properly. 

When asked about projected 
usage for the phones, Dcnhartog 
said, "I hope they don't have to 
be used. However, we're happy 
the phones are there in case they 
need to be used." 

Police and Safety is staffed 24- 



hours a day, Denhanog said stu- 
dents should not hesiutc to call 
at any time if they need assis- 
tance, whether emergency or 
non -emergency. 




EMERGENCY PHQNES 

# Where to find them on campus 




A student checks out a new 
caiDpus emergency phone. 

Cops respond to 
emergency call 

Two emergency phone signals 
sounded at 7:11 p.m. on April 
14. 

Sgt. Tom Haner answered the 
calls. Nobody responded, 

Haner looked up the locations 
of ihe alarms, and requested an 
officer to check out the area. 

Haner returned lo the phone 
and said, "Hello. Is anybody 
there? Are you hurt? Do you 
need assistance?" 

Nobody responded. 

The police officer said nobody 
was in the area of the phones. 

Both alarms were shut down, 
and campus police were func- 
tioning normally by 7:15 p.m, 

Haner said prank calls would 
probably be a problem for a 
while, but campus police would 
still have to react to every call, 

"We arc here to help the stu- 
dents, but we're not here to play 
games with them. It's noi good 
to have to pull officers to check 
oui prank calls," said Haner, 



would light a match, and some- 
one would be hun, but the air 
was pretty pure so it ended up 
that there really wasn't much of 
a threat," said Haner. 

The ruptured line was located 
just south of the Life Sciences 
Building, according to police 
reports, 

Haner said he wasn't Uiere, but 
three police officers and some 
Physical Plant employees 
secured die area. 



"// only look them one hour 
from the lime NIPSCO was 
notified lo when we were up 
and running again," 
â– Sgt. Tom Haner 

"Too many people add to die 
confusion. They said they had 
the situation under control, so I 
stayed put," said Haner. 

Haner said everything was run- 
ning fine, and Hoagland Electric 
will be back out next week to 
finish laying the phone lines.

Truant senators don't 
belong in our senate 



IPSGA has haii its share of embar- 
rassments within its recent history. 
The fact that senators can't be both- 
ered to go to meetings has to be the 
worst of aU, though. 

They toot: their jobs under the stu- 
dents' assumption that they could be 
trusted to handle affairs and manage 
student money, A number of the cur- 
rent senators can't do those jobs. 

Half of the senate didn't make it to 
four weeks' worth of meetings. 
Some pleaded tests, schoolwork, 
jobs, illness, etc. but half the senate? 
They came up with their meeting 
time at die beginning of the year, and 
they should be able to stick to it. 

In the meantime, student business 
stopped cold. SAB had to go without 
some badly needed funds, as did the 
Forensic League. A new fine arts 
group. Electronic Visual Arts, has 
been up and running for some time 
without its constitution having been 
approved by die senate. 

Probably the best example of how 
slack the senate has become is the 
new Collegiate Book Exchange pro- 



gram. This is an exciting program 
through which IPFW students can 
access a list of used books for sale. 

Jim Kruse, creator of program, 
made a presentation before the sen- 
ate. Senators seemed enthusiastic, 
but a bill allocating a sum of money 
for promoting CBEN languished dur- 
ing senate's hiatus. 

Though student enthusiasm for the 
program is reportedly very high, the 
senators, in effect, blocked it. The 
fact that registration time and 
semester-^s end were drawing closer 
made the matter more urgent, yet 
senators did nothing. 

IPSGA needs a quicker way to 
weed out bad senators. The current 
impeachment policy is far too slow. 
An amendment to the IPSGA consti- 
tution is being debated now by the 
senate. Any amendment they pass 
needs to be strict,, and it needs to be 
passed and in place for the fall 
semester. 

The senate can't be allowed to 
ignore student business. 



I like my skin as white 
as a ghost, thank you 



By K. L. CarofT 
Staff Writer 

It"s that tanning time of year again. 
IPFW is already blooming with stu- 
dents, who, whether by virtue of race 
or "tanability," boast wonderfully 
dark skin. And proud of that skin 
they are. Big numbers of students, 
not content to wait until trees bud 
and grass grows green, are already 
wearing shorts to class. You Hoosiers 
sure know how to rush a season. 

This year, however. I will not be 
among the gloriously golden. You 
see, in February of this year I turned 
30, and the "stop tanning" clause I 
had previously written into my inter- 
nal lifetime personal appearance con- 
tract went into effect. 

This contract also contained claus- 
es about wearing denim miniskirts 
(that slopped at age 25) and bathing 
suits (I have not been swimming in 
public since my daughter was bom in 
'85). It's useful in preventing me 
from making costly and embarrass- 
ing beauty mistakes. Call it my per- 
sonal effort to keep America beauti- 
ful. 

But back to my decision to go tan- 
less. The truth is, it has nothing to do 
with fear of skin cancer, although it 
probably should. The fact is, I have 
vampire-white, fragile skin. Typing 
paper has more pigment than I do, I 
have only been able to tan in the past 
with great difficulty, but I have done 
so because I firmly believe that there 
is nothing uglier than white legs 
sticking out from under a pair of 



shorts. Think uncooked breadsticks 
wrapped in madras napkins. 

Anyway, last summer, while I was 
pursuing my usual tepid tan 
(Ponderosa pine rather than golden 
teak), I noticed that my skin was 
beginning to look, well, tanned, I 
mean like cowhide. Fine lines broke 
out on my face each time I wor- 
shipped the sun. Not only is my skin 
as white as typing paper, it wrirJdes 
like linen. 

My worst fears were confirmed 
when I got a good look at a colleague 
who was naturally fair-skinned, but 
routinely tanned her .skin. At age 35, 
she looked like a blue-eyed handbag. 
So I accessed my internal beauty 
contract and typed in the "stop tan- 
ning at 30" clause. 

I've had second and third thoughts 
since then, particularly because this 
new development in my beauty regi- 
men means no more shorts or sleeve- 
less tops, But I have had encourage- 
ment. My little sister. Amy, is even 
more fair-skinned than I, and she 
assured me that going tanless will not 
spell the end of summer fun for me. 

"You'll stand out," she said. Yeah, 
like reflector tape on a moonless 
night. Yet I find solace in the fact 
that fall always comes quickly. In no 
time at all. I'll be showing off my 
porcelain skin in the best and latest 
fashions I can afford. After all, my 
"stop being fashion trendy" clause 
doesn't go into effect until I'm 40. 




Bible condemns capital punishment, pro-lifers 



To Ihe Editor: 
A student's letter in The 

Communicator said the so-called 
"pro-life" stance also supports 
capital punishmeni. The letter 
showed a lack of understanding of 
the Christian faith and a poor 
reading of the Bible. 

In defense of capital punishment, 
the Old Testament passage of "an 
eye for an eye" is usually touted 
out. However, in the New 
Testament. Matthew 5;38. Jesus 
states, "You have heard thai it was 
said, 'An eye for an eye and a 
tooth for a tooth." But I say to 
you, do not resist an evildoer. But 
if anyone strikes you on the right 
cheek, turn the other also; and if 
anyone wants to sue you and take 
your coal, give your cloak as well 
..."{NRSV). 

And in Matthew 5:48, "You 
have heard that it was said, 'You 
shall love your neighbor and hate 
your enemy.' But I say to you, 
love your enemies and pray for 
those who persecute you." Jesus 
preaches that the old way of retali- 
ation and punishment is over; now 
the people of God are to show for- 
giveness and mercy, even to their 



In John 8, a mob of religious 
men bring before Jesus a woman 
caught in adultery. By their reli- 



gious law, she is to be stoned. 
(Where was the man who commit- 
ted odulicry with her? Why was 
he not being punished?) Jesus 
instead chastises the men, 
"Whoever is without sin cast the 
first stone," and the men leave in 

In Matthew 5 Jesus says, "You 
have heard that it was said to 
those of ancient times, "You shall 
not murder and whoever murders 
shall be liable to judgement.' But 
1 say lo you that if you arc angry 
with a brother or sister, you will 
be liable to the council and if you 
say 'you fool' you will be liable to 
the hell of fire," 

Before the anti-choice people 
accuse anyone of "murder," they 
should inspect their own lives and 
SCO if they are wiihout sin enough 

If mere mortal humans are too 
imperfect to choose whether to 
terminate a pregnancy (as anti- 
choice people claim), how much 
more, then, arc humans too imper- 
fect to "play God" at judging 
criminal guilt. Most murderers are 
not executed, but the innocent 
have been. 

Criminals may sit on death row 
for years, then go free. The guilty 
stall off execution and lie up the 
courts through years of appeals. 



Jeffrey Dahmcr tortured, killed, 
and cannibalized at least IS men, 
and is reworded with free room, 
board, and medical treatment for 
the rest ofhis life. Those who kill 
whites arc more likely to be exe- 
cuted than those who kill blacks. 
Blacks arc more likely to be exe- 
cuted than whites. There is tittle in 
the present justice system to call it 
"pro-life" or even "pro-viciim," 

Changing the topic to abortion, 
two things I'd like to say. First, 
the majority of (Thrisiians arc pro- 
choice, according to a survey con- 
ducted by the Religious Coalition 
for Abortion Rights (100 
Maryland Avenue, Washington, 
D.C.). 

Many Jews, Christians, and pas- 
tors participated in the April 5 
March for Women's Lives in 
Washington D.C. The official 
stance of most mainline Protestani 
denominations is pro-choice. The 
word "abortion" is not in the 
Bible, and any "anti-abortion" 
messages in the Bible arc read 
into scripture by zealots trying to 
prove their point. 

In the book of Leviticus, the law 
stales that if a man causes a preg- 
nant woman to miscany. he is to 
pay her a fine. If the fetus was 
considered to be a "person," the 
man would instead be executed. 



The Bible says nothing about 
pregnancy, but says a great deal 
about children, men, women, wid- 
ows, and those already bom and 
breathing. 

My second point is that anli- 
choicc talk about "innocent life" 
and "babies" is really a smoke 
screen for the real intent of con- 
trolling women. The anti-choice 
movement was begun and is led 
by men. Male pastors dump guilt 
and shame onto women who have 
had abortions, while not subject- 
ing other men to such hate. Why 
arc these men so obsessed with 
the contents of a woman's womb? 

The men who claim to "love 
babies" will tell women to stay 
home to raise these babies, yet 
never lift a finger of ihcir own to 
help. Celibate Catholic priests 
who urge women to produce 
many children will never care for 
babies themselves. The real agen- 
da of Ihe anti-choice movement is 
to oppress and dominate women 
through harassment ai clinics and 
restrictive laws. 

Jesus always gave women love, 
respect, dignity, and affirmaiion; 
no doubt he feels insulted by the 
"Christians" who hale women in 
his name. 

Sally Carpenter 
IPFW Associate Faculty 



Pres. Ehrlich informative, interesting in forum 



To the Editor: 

The oiher morning 1 had the 
pleasure and privilege of spending 

1 hour wiih one of Indiana's most 



influ&lt; 



leadei 



India 



University President Tom Ehrlich. 
President Ehriich (he pronounces 
it Er-lish) was on the IPFW cam- 
pus to atuwer questions from stu- 
dents and faculty. In this column 1 
would like to share his comments 
with those noi fonimate enough to 
attend. 

During his introduction he was 
referred to as a very human per- 
son. Throughoul the open forum, I 
realized how accurate this descrip- 
tion was. Besides making time for 
the meeting, he listened carefully 
to each student, making a sincere 
effort to address each individual 



He opened the discussion by 
saying ihai getting input from stu- 
dents was one of ihc most difficult 
parts of his job. He then encour- 
aged everyone to openly ask ques- 



tions, lo write to him after the 
meeting and lo encourage others 
to do so. He promised to read each 
letter personally and respond lo 
each. This promise alone demon- 
strates his commitment to the 
community of Indiana. 

Unfortunately, few students 
(only about 15) look the opportu- 
nity to visit President Ehrlich and 
share their Ihoughis. To be in the 
presence of a man of such stature 
is an honor in iLscIf, but to be able 
lo have a forum with him is a rare 

Those who did attend asked 
some direct questions about cam- 
pus dorms, health care, and other 
topics of concern lo ihe students. 
President Ehrlich also asked a few 
of his own questioas, demonstrat- 
ing the desire to receive input. 
Throughout ihe hour he provided 
the students wiUi articulate non- 
evasive answers and tticy in turn 
provided hJm wilh a small flavor 
of life ai IPFW. 



While mosl students were asking 
what he could do about so and so, 
I thought it only fair lo ask how 
we, as Indiana residents, could 
help him as well. 

He graciously thanked me for 
the question, then gave an uneX' 
pectcd response. He said tlirough- 
out his career, he has never found 
a state which has more love for a 
university ihan wc Indiana 
Hoosiers have for lU. Yet, to his 
disappointment he found that this 
love was not conveyed through 
the 150 members in the state leg- 
islature. He stressed that unless 
these key decision makers hear 
from their eonstiiuents, they sim- 
ply will not assign higher educa- 
tion a priority in die state. 

In a nulshcll, he urged all of us 
to let our legislators know of the 
appreciation wc have for Indiana 
University and the importance wc 
assign to higher education for the 
Slate of Indiana. He called partic-

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Campus minister speaks out on continuing abortion debate rhetoric 



To the Editor: 

Having recently moved to Fon 
Wayne and beginning as campus 
minister I have been very inter- 
ested in the ongoing debate on 
abortion. 

Tlie other half of my profession- 
al life is spent as an associate pas- 
tor at First Presbyterian Church. 
Because the church is located 
across the street from the 
Women's Health Organization, I 
have the opportunity every 
Thursday morning to see the Fon 
Wayne mounted police and 
opposing groups of protestors 
whose signs range from "STOP 
ABORTION NOW to "PRO- 
CHOICE IS PRO-LIFE," 

1 have also been reading with 
interest the wide variety of per- 
spectives offered in The 
Communicator's leners to the edi- 
tor. I want to take this opportunity 

Write-ins 



to respond to points which have 
been made in these letters and to 
offer a suggestion for critical 
evaluation of various perspectives 
in a mutually respectful manner. 

Response to Elaine Conner's 
letter in the April 2nd edition: 

While I respect your right to 
express your opinion it appears to 
me that you have constructed an 
argument intended to offend Pro- 
Life people as much as their per- 
spective offends you. 

I particularly want to respond to 
your comments about "an alleged 
God," and "their science fiction 
novel they call a Bible." 

First of all I would Uke to sug- 
gest that there are many people 
who share a belief in God and the 
Bible as inspired by God who 
share your pro-choice perspective. 
Thus, these comments seem to 
serve the purpose of alienating 



people who otherwise can appre- 
ciate your point of view. 

I might add that your suggestion 
that anti-abortionists should focus 
on children who are already born 
is a valid and con.sirucrive sugges- 
tion. I hope Uiat all of us can find 
ways to value the gift of life. 

Response to Stacy Folks' letter 

"All of us feel to one degree 
or another the complexity of 
the legal, ethical, moral and 
spiritual issues in volved. " 
-Paul Bretz 

in the April 9th edition: 

I respect your willingness to 
struggle with the question of 
whether a pro-life and pro-capital 
punishment position are compati- 
ble. What I have problems with is 
the way in which you selected 
passages from the Bible to back 



up your argument. 

What you have done is com- 
monly known as "pttiof-texting." 
Many people outside the religious 
community are rightly skeptical 
of our attempts to draw on one or 
more specific texts to back up our 
perspective. When we do this 
most of the time we end up using 
verses that support our precon- 
ceived ideas on a given subject 
and neglect those which may 
challenge our views. 

Your selection of verees focuses 
on the New Testament emphasis 
on supporting the government, 
and the Old Testament emphasis 
on punishment fitting the crime. 
What you have failed to mention 
is the New Testament emphasis 
on God's laws being higher than 
human laws, and Jesus' negation 
of the principle of "an eye for an 
eye" found in Matthew 5:38. in 



which we are encouraged not to 
retaliate and to love our enemies. 

The presentation of various per- 
spectives on abortion is very 
appropriate in a university con- 
text. It seems to me that IPFW 
is a very logical place to continue 
the debate on issues related to 
abortion. 

I would like to offer the possibil- 
ity that Campus Ministry and 
University Religious Forum work 
with any other interested campus 
organizations in organizing a 
forum in which Pro-Life and Pro- 
Choice perspectives are offered in 
a mutually respectful setting. 

Anyone who is interested in 
helping put together this type of 
opportunity please contact me at 



Hey Mikey, I like it 



To the Editor: 

Jim Walker's article about the 
write-in votes for student govern- 
ment elections was the closest 
ihing to an interesting student gov- 
ernment article I have seen this 
year; out of God knows how many 
student government articles that 
have been in this paper. 

Considering that your idea of a 
student government newsbrief is 
to say that they have not had a 
senate meeting for three weeks. 
Well, how many weeks out of the 
school year does that leave that 
they did have a meeting? You 
must be hard up for news. Either 
that, or else student government is 
paying you big money to write 
about everything they do or don't 
do so they can keep their names in 
the news. 

Back to the write-in votes. If I 
had known I could write in votes I 
would have shown up for elec- 
tions, if not to vote seriously dien 
at least to see how creative I could 
be, 

I can't decide which write-in 
vote was funniest: Mikey the Life 
Cereal Kid, or Mark Snyder and 
Nancy Barger. I also could not 
decide which write-in vole was

scariest: Jeffrey Dahmer or Mark 
Snyder and Nancy Barger. 

I think 1 would've written in 
Jerry Brown, myself. That way I 
could wrap up the funniest and 
scariest categories with one vote. 
Pat Buchanan is also an option, 
but there's nothing funny about 
him.

THE COMMUNICATOR 



Thad offers handy summer employment tips 



Thursday. April 16,1992 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in Chief 

Are you a people person? Wanl lo 
make BIG MONEY? Well slay luncd 
for Job Tips, I'm your lovely hosi, 
Thad. And I'm going lo make you 
rich, rich, rich. 

JOB TIPS WITH THAD: Now is 
the lime for all good college siudenis 
[0 begin the search for summer 
cmpIoymenL 

Now is the time lo begin idling mom 
and dad about die shrinking job markci 
and die toll tJic recession has taken on 
the number of employmcni opportuni- 
ties available in die area. 

Now is also the time for mom and 
dad to tell you to shut up, gc[ off your 
lazy ass and fmd a summer job. 

Well, I don't really need to find a 
summer job because I'm old and 1 live 
on my own with cats. Also I can live 
quite comfortably year round on my 



-figure Obiruse Angle salary. 

But even though I'm not looking for 
a job. the Angle staff has searched dili- 
gently through job listings and help- 
wanted pages to compile what I like to 
call Job Tips widi Thad. 

First. Some Tips 

1. Look good: Always wear a tie to 
job inicrviews. It doesn't matter if you 
are applying at some place like 
Ponderosa cither. Wear the damned 
tie. Thai's how they pick employees. 

Picked fifsi arc people in nice plain 
tics. Picked next arc people in ties 
from the 70s that arc as wide as mosi 
of their chcsis. And picked last arc 
geeks who wear clip-on lies. 

Oh. the wcar-a-tic policy goes for 
women too. If you wear a dress or 
blouse without a collar, wrap the lie 
around your neck like a scarf. 

2. Smell good: This requires shower- 
ing. I recommend going to Hudson's 



lo spray a bunch of Polo sampler on 
yourself if yqu don't have lime for a 
baUi. 

3. Don't cat snack items or chew 
gum during interview. 

4. Refrain from, belching or scratch- 
ing loo much.

views in no way reflect the opinions of

dictions seem outlandish and exagger- 
ated, the fact remains â€” the bastard is 
always right. 



RINK GUARD; The Terrace ai the

around and bust old people and chil- 
dren who move loo slowly on the ice. 
Free whistle provided. 

SELL BOOKS: Encyclopedia 
Brilannica says they are swamped with 
requests for encyclopedia sales in Fort 
Wayne. Must be good at delivering die 
line "No, libraries got rid of cncyclo- 
fKdias years ago." 

SAVONS: Jobs arc always available 
for selling cosmetics door to door and 
to friends jUid neighbor. 

I recommend having a lot of friends 
and neighbors who enjoy garish colors 



on their faces. 

TEACH DANCE: The world's 
largest dance organization, which 
wishes to remain anonymous, has 
openings for social dance teachers. 

Teach waltzes, polkas and all. No 
experience necessary. Eaiplugs recom- 
mended. 

CHOIR DIRECTOR: Local church 
needs directors for morning services. 
Atheists need not apply.

job's in Detroit and you'll be eating 
lunch with deranged murderera.

have your own C.B. handle (ex. Red 
Doggy). Must also be really into lis- 
tening lo Garth Brooks and slaying 
awake for a week while driving 
ttcaked-out on amphetamines. 

FLYER DISTRIBUTERS: Job 
description includes putting flyers on 
cars. Also, walking around the lot 
moments later to pick up hundreds of 
discarded flyers nobody even looked 
aL

job at Picway Shoes. Become the next

MEXICAN MANAGER: "The point 
isn't just to work ,,. the point is to 
have a great career! Chi-Chi's is the 
right choice," Right. 

CRACKER MANAGER: The 
Cracker Barrel restaurant is looking 
for a manager. Lispcrs need not apply. 

HOT N' NOW: 1 don't know if ihey 
really have any jobs open but I just 



wanted to say their way-cool slogan â–  
"I want mine Hot and Now!" 

AZAR'S THUG; Azar's Big Boy is 
looking for a dim-witted lough to 
dress up as Big Boy and loss out 
studying college students who hang 
around the "restaurant" too long. 
Now, hit the bricks 

Studies show there is no better way 
to find a job than actually looking for 
one. So after carefully considering all 
of the options, I recommend prospec- 
tive employees hit the streets and start 
filling out applicabons. 



Here's a tip about job applications: 
No two should be alike. Create handy 
pasi work experience al places thai 
have convenicndy "gone out of busi- 
nzss" since you quit. 

Good luck chumps 

I really doubt you'll find much out 
there now if you don't already have a 
job. 

You might end up sweating out the 
summer at Rally's. Oh well. I don't 
CSK anyway, I'm a fat cat columnist, 
Hah Hah Hah. I pity you working- 
class peasants.

Music commentary 



Classic rock radio stations feature safe playlists 



By Chad Hesling 

Managing Editor 

and 

Chris Colcord 

SlafT Writer 

History will credit President 
Ronald Reagan for a number of 
outrages. Among (hem are the 
unchecked spread of AIDS. Ihc 
rise of homelessness rales, and the 
burgeoning deficit. 

Above and beyond these crimes. 
though, he will be remembered as 
the man who helped spawn classic 
rcicic, 

Reagan's revolution of 
conservatism was so pervasive 
during the early 80's that it even 
spilled onto rock and roll. As a 
result, classic rock and oldies 
stations blossomed and changed, 
for the worse, and forever the way 
we listen to the radio. 

Another culprit was the movie 
"The Big Chill," a dewy-eyed 
paean to baby boomers about how 
great things used to be and how 
horrid things are now. 

The movie featured a soundtrack 
of familiar Motown tunes, and the 
soundtrack sold four million copies 
almost immediately. Its success 
caused an instant transformation 
for radio; almost overnight oldies 
and classic rock songs saturated 
the FM dial. 

The Rolling Stones should be 

NANNIES!!; 

ic Ttiuii growing igoicy i 



tagged as a culprit, too. By Idling 
Jovan toiletries co-sponsor their 
1981 North American tour, they 
served notice that the 60s children 
could be sold with 60s rock and 
nail. The store was open, said Mick 
'n' Keith, and "Street Fighting 
Man" makes a great musk jingle. 

As a result. 1992 radio has 
become unlisicnable. Look: there's 

"Considering that rock owes 
90 percent of its existence to 
blues, it's pretty hard to 
swallow any classic rock 
format that segregates as 
completely as The Bear or 
Rock 104." 

nothing wrong with a little 
nostalgia (keyword: "little") but 
does anyone need to hear "Free 
Bird." "My Girl." or "Old Time 
Rock and Roll" again? 

In Fort Wayne, a conservative 
city in a conservative state, classic 
rock and oldies stations dominate 
the dial. Two can be said to be 
"classic rock" formanedâ€” WBYR 
(The Bear), and WXKE (Rock 
104). The two arc close in format, 
with WXKE reaching out to 



teenagers in addition to baby 
boomers. 

Their playlists are great, if you 
haven't heard any music in twenty 
years â€” Zcp. Pink Floyd, Bob 
Soger. Boston. REO Speedwagon. 
They even share the same 
slogan â€” 'The Right Rock. Right 
Now." "Right Rock" means "right 
wing," apparently. 

Both are terrified of black music 
and won't play a bit of it. Some 
Jimi Hendrix. true, or "The Thnll 
Is Gone" and Living Colour. 
Outside of those, I defy you to find 
a black voice on cither station. 

Considering that rock owes 90 
percent of its existence to blues, 
it's pretty hard to swallow any 
classic rock format that segregates 
as completely as The Bear or Rock 
104. 

Draw a line â€” Robert Johnson to 
Muddy Waters to Chuck Berry to 
Little Richard to James Brown to 
Islcy Brothers to Temptations to A] 
Green to Hendrix to Sly Stone to 
Prince to George Clinton to Run 
D.M.C. to Living Colour. 
Shouldn't these stations be more 
receptive to black music? 

Not here! A Rock 104 ad spat this 



out: "Rock and rap don't mix â€” 
keep it pure!" I bet that warmed 
the hearts of local white 
supremacists, with its emphasis on 
"purity." The Bear is guilty of 
obviously racist ads, too. Listen for 
them. 
The Bear's declaration that it is 
"The Last Untamed Radio Station" 
is so laughable it hurts. 
"Untamed?" A station that plays 
Journey. Styx, and Foghai? Is the 
Bear "untamed" because it plays

Volleydons win conference; 
Net no. 1 seed in tourney 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

The Volleydons captured their 
second consecutive Midwest 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association 
title on Saturday with a win over Ball 
Stale University. IPFW completed 
their MIVA schedule undefeated in six 
matches, and ncucd the No. I seed in 
the MIVA loumamenL 

The Volleydons will face Wisconsin- 
Milwaukee in the semi-final game 
[omorrow at Columbus. Ohio, 

Coach Amic Ball is not looking past 
Wisconsin. "We are concerned about 
being overconfident. They arc a much 
improved team." said Ball. 

Wisconsin has never beaten IPFW, 
and won only one game in their 
previous matches. If the Volleydons 
win they will then face either Ball 
State or Ohio State in the final game. 

The Cardinals jumped to an 8-2 lead 
in game one at the IPFW Multi- 
purpose Building on Saturday, 
capitalizing on the Volleydons' 
passing errors, IPFW staged a 
comeback and tied the score 10-10 
behind Lloy Ball's sets and improved 
passing. Ball Siate swung the 
momentum back and was able to score 
the next two points, but faltered on 
two gamc-poinl serves. The 
Volleydons' height proved to be 
insurmountable for Ball Slates' hitters 
as IPFW won game one 17-15, 

Game two proved to be the 
Volleydons" strongest of the match as 
they easily won by the score of 15-3. 

Much like game one. Ball Stale look 
an early lead of 5-2 as the Volleydons' 
starters lost the momentum of game 



two. Two kills by Neil Day and 
Quenlin Spcigel finally finished off 
the Cardinals 16-14, after Ball State 
had tied the score at 14 in game three. 

The match is the fu^sl time in three 
attempts this season that the 
Volleydons have been able to beat the 
Cardinals in three games. 

"The first and third games could 
have gone to either team. Ball Stale 
made some errors and we did not," 
said Ball. 



Volleyball NCAA 
Final Four tickets 
available. 

The tournament 
will be held at Ball 
State in Muncie in 
two weeks.

State ticket office 
at 1-800-654-7515.

Baseball team 0-10 

By Jew Heersche 
Sports Editor 

A combination of poor fielding and a 
low batting average has yielded a 
winless season in conference play for 
the men's baseball team. 

The Mastodons (0-10) have 
committed 78 errors compared to their 
opponents' 35 errors this season. "We 
can't win ballgames with that number 
of errors," coach Carl Wilcoxson said. 

"Our hitting is a miserable .220." 
added Wilcoxson, IPFW's opponents 
are averaging ,327. 

Overall the Mastodons have a 4-22 
record, and Wilcoxson sees a 
continued effort from the players to 
try to win, 

"We have a couple pretty good 
pitchers, Chris Delagrangc has pitched 
31 innings and is 2-2, and he is our 
youngest," Wilcoxson said. 

On Sunday, IPFW lost to SL Francis 
in a double header by scores of 5-4 
and 5-1, 



REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE 



Spiegel had 21 kills for the 
Volleydons, as yet another offensive 
threat became apparent lo IPFW foes, 
"For ihc last month I have been 
playing 12 kids consistently. We have 
more depth," said Ball. Lloy Ball had 
45 assists, seven digs, and three aces 
for IPFW.

Women's softball news 

Lady 'Dons drop to 6-6 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

The women's softball team has 
moved to 6-6 in conference play after 
losing a double header to Kentucky 
Wesleyan on Sunday, and splitting a 
pair of games with Ashland on 
Monday. 

Coach Dale Van Houien is 
concerned with the play of his 
defense. 

"The teamwork is coming 
together, but when we have 
errors it is hard to win." 
â– Coach Dale Van Houien 

"The teamwork is coming together, 
but when we have errors it is hard to 
win," said Van Houien. 

"We are leading the league in hitting 
and the girls arc pitching well, but we 
have a defense problem," added Van 
Houien. 

Michelle Volz (.520), Tina Mcnicr 
(.467). Michelle Conley (.385) and 
Jennifer Martin (,359) are leading die 
Lady 'Dons in batting averages. The 



four women are much of the reason 
the team leads the conference in 
hitting, 

IPFW is being paced by Angie 
Quickery's pitching proficiency which 
has placed her fourth in the conference 
in strikeouts. 

The 1-ady "Dons next and last home 
game is against conference foe 
Southern Indiana on April 20 at 3 p.m. 
at Johnny Applcseed Park, field no. 3.
