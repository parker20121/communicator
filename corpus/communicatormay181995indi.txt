Hasta la vista '95 graduates 



Mt^lissii Yi.unn-Florcs 
Chief Reporter 

Promptly at 7 p.m. last Wednesday, Direcior 
George A. Cavanagh and ihc IPFW Symphonic Winds 
scl Ihc mood for approximalcly 1,500 seniors to make 
their way dirough Ihc Memorial Coliseum for iheir 
long awaited diplomas. 

In his presentation of the class oT '95, 
Chancellor Michael Warlcll said. "We value the rich 
background and diversity these students have brought 
10 this university. As a result, employers frequently 
comment on the quality of our graduates, and their 
ability to continue to learD." 

Graduate Ja.son Essig said of his prospects in the 
working world, "I'm glad to be out and am looking for- 
ward to being in the workforce." 

Essig not only received his diploma, but also 
became the first IPFW graduate to cam die Bachelor of 
Fine Arts widi a concentration in photography. "It's 
amazing. I didn't even know until a teacher brought it 
up," Essig said. "It's not a very well accepted part of 
fine arts." 

Bssig hopes 10 obtain a job at a studio, but said 
thai he will miss die positive critiques and direction 
that tie received in college. 

Graduate Maureen Gaff recalls her first day as a 
student. "The very first diiy was lerrible. I was scared 




oui of my mind. After that it was wonderful," Gaff 
said. 

As a returning adult. Gaff said she received a lot 
of support and compassion from professors and univer- 
sity deparimenis. 

"For a while ii seemed like I'd never get there 
and then when I did it seemed like it came so fast," she 
said. 

Gaff has already been involved with die publica- 
tion of a collection of archives, and research called 
"Adventures on the Western Frontiers." 

Unlike Essig. Gaff is not sure which path she 
will take next, bui said she hopes to keep busy. 

"I'm kind of looking for a job in research. I'm 
also considering graduate school, but I haven't decided, 
I'm just looking for something to keep me busy." said 
Gaff. 

IPFW students were not the only ones honored 
for hard work and dedication. Both Indiana University 
President Miles Brand and Purdue University President 
Steven C Becring presented one honorary Doctorate 
of Humane Letters. 

Mark E. Neely Jr., a professor at Saint Louis 
University, was awarded the lU Doctorate of Humane 
Letters for his devotion to the study of the life of 
Abraham Lincoln and the entire Civil War era. 

While living in the Fort Wayne area, Neely was 
the direcior of the Lincoln Museum and the editor of 
ihe museum's publication "Lincoln Lore." 
Neely has written several books and was 
awarded the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for his accom- 
plishments in writing and research. 

Purdue Univereity bestowed an hon- 
orary doctorate to David S. Ridderheim, Jr., 
chief executive officer of Parkview. 

Ridderheim was commended for 
helping to establish Ihe IPFW-Parkvicw 
Nursing Program and serving on the IPFW 
Community Advisory Council. 

Ridderheim also teaches courses on 
health policy and politics, established the 
Stucky Medical Research Center, made several 
additions lo the Parkview campus possible, and 
aided with die development of the Samaritan 
emergency helicopter program.

Conservative commentator Buckley

Right-wing advocate 
identifies education 
obstacles 



byS. Etrant Kelley 
Editor-in-Chief 

William F. Buckley, radio and 
newspaper commentator, pointed 
10 problems he saw on America's 
educational Landscape in front of 
500 people at the Walb Union 
Ballroom 




Buckley 



American 
high school 
graduates 
today Despite the steady growdi of 
the amount of money spent on the 
American educational system, he 
said it has worsened since the 
1960's. 

Problems with education Hi into 
a larger framework in which 
Buckley discussed problems with 



society and problems with the gov- 
ernment's solutions. 

He compared the Uniicd States 
10 the former Soviet Union where 
the stale's agrieullure system was 
proven unworkable, but still used 
nonetheless. He said the United 
States is similar in failing to 
change steadily worsening systems. 

Buckley placed part of the 
blame for do i,vnward- spiral in g eco- 
nomic and social conditions on the 
public itself and said people should 
demand the government spend 
money on programs which "make 
sense." 

Buckley said Ihe public's politi- 
cal opinions may be shifting to the 
right, but he also saJd he does not 
know how far people will change 
or how long the change will last. 
He added that Ihe tesulu of the 
1996 elections should be interest- 
ing. 

While the 1994 election's 
results arc reason for optimism, 
Buckley said, he is not yet conn- 
dent sweeping changes in the gov- 
ernment's operation will take place 
and added thai government rarely 
downsizes peacefully. He did not 
justify violence, but asked the pub- 
lic to aitempi to make the existing 
better. 



personal space. 

According to Hawley, the rest of 
the class did not feel that way. 
Hawley wrote Hinga a letter in 
which he did not apologize for what 
be said but apologized to Hinga for 
how she perceived his comments. 
Hawley appeared in the class to 
personally speak lo Hinga. 
According to Hawley, after he com- 
mented to her, another student 
called Hawley back to class for an 
ovation from the other students in 
class. 

"When you have 28 out of 29 
students applauding you for a job 
well done you are touched," 
Hawley said, "I've only had two or 
three classes ever do Uiai in my 26 
years at IPFW." 

Hinga said she was not satisfied 
wiUi Hawley's "apology." She said 
the letter she received did not fully 
address her charges. "It sucked as 
an apology." Hinga said. "I fell 
uncomfortable and his behavior 
was entirely inappropriate for a 
class." Hinga said. "I would've 
liked to see the man fired," she 
added. 

Hinga said she felt die adminis- 
tration dragged their feet in this 
maiter and has not done anything lo 
assist her. "As a woman, 1 find life 
very hard on this campus," she said. 

Mary Scudder, coordinator of 
the human services department, 
said her office was invesdgating the 
suit filed by Hinga. 

Hinga and another student in 
Hawley's class met with Dean of 
Students Marian Zimmerman, 
Equal Opportunity Officer Donna 
Middleion and Scudder to discuss 
Hinga" s allegations. 

Zimmerman and Middleion were 
unable to be reached for comment.

Drug testing benefits employer 
in new ways 



By Adiim Sanders 
Guest Writer 

When John Smith's supervisor 
called him into her office he had 
only been on die job for two days 
and had taken an employee drug 
test only 24 hours earlier. Fear and 
paranoia began to set in as the 
supervisor sat down across the desk 
from Smith (not his real name). His 
palms began to sweat, his face 
turned red and his mouth was dry. 

It had been three and a half 
weeks since he last smoked mari- 
juana, and he'd been sweating out 
the results of his drug test ever 
since he heard it was mandatory for 
all new employees. As a recent col- 
lege graduate. Smith had grown 
accustomed to bis campus lifestyle 
and couldn't pass on a couple of 
hits before taking in a movie one 
night. 

Now. three and a half weeks 
later, he was afraid he had failed 
his drug screen and absolutely 
frightened he was being called into 
his supervisor's office to be lold 
how he hadn't passed, hadn't even 
come close. He was sure diey were 
going to tell him how his urine had 
lumed blood red when they mixed 
it with ihc discovery solution, and 
how there was no way a tainted 
drug-infcsied hooligan could ever 
work for this company. 

Smith beard the supervisor 
speak but was so nervous that he 
couldn't understand what she was 
saying. So he began to listen for 
key words and phrases like. 
"failed," "drug test," "fired" and 
"lei go." But lo his surprise, none 
of dicm came, and before he knew 
it, he was shaking hands and being 
congratulated on his new raise. He 
caught the words "salary upgrade" 
before he left quickly and quietly. 

Mandatory drug tests are just 
one of the many new and complex 
issues facing Smith and thousands 
of other recent college graduates. 
As the 2Ist century approaches, 
business is not as usual and the 
only thing job seekers can be siwe 
of is change. From the work place 



lo job requirements to Ihe jobs 
themselves, employment in die next 
century is going to be an adventure 
into die unknown. 

For example, there are a couple 
of tests that students are taking 
these days that don't have anything 
to do with classes. There is a grow- 
ing interest in the corporate com- 
munity 10 use drug screens, back- 
ground checks and personality 
exams to weed out candidates with 
unsavory exuacurricular habits. 

George Packard of North 
American Van Lines said his com- 
pany uses die tests to ensure a safe 
working environment for his 
employees. "We use drug screens 
and background checks to make 
sure dial no one's safety is compro- 
mised." he said. Packard conlinued. 
"Our goal is to develop a trusting 
relationship widi our clientele, and 
diis is one way to guarantee that we 
get quality safety-conscious indi- 
viduals. We are a transportation 
company and cannot compromise 
safety." 

These preliminary screening 
techniques used by companies are 
also becoming more popular. David 
Wingate, the director of processing 
at Wayne Labs, said his company 
has seen a steady increase in the 
number of drug lesus diey have per- 
formed each year over die last six 
years. Wingate staled, "I Uiink that 
businesses are focusing more on 
whai kind of employee ihey hire. 
They want to make sure ihat the 
person diey interviewed is also the 
person that is going io show up for 
work five days a week." 

Patrolman Doug Joyce of the 
Norfolk Southern Police 
Department said that companies 
who inquire about background 
checks want to ensure that iheir 
employees have been truthful when 
it comes to their criminal back- 
ground. Employers want to be able 
u verify some basic aspects of an 
employee's credentials and back- 
ground." Joyce continued. There 
has been an increase in the amount 
of interest in diese types of invesli- 
gations during the past couple of 



years. 

Drug tests and background 
checks are likely to be a prevnicnl 
part of Ihc job search process for 
quite some lime. But one thing that 
is likely to change is tlie jobs stu- 
dents are seeking. 

The editors of P.O.V., a New 
York-based lifestyle magazine. 
have compiled a list of Ihe top ten 
employment positions likely to 
grow and mo,st likely to decline for 
die new century. 

Dank tellers, factory workers 
and telephone operator positions 
are expected to decrease dramati- 




cally. With the advtni of ATM 
machines, bank tellers are one of 
the few jobs expected to decline in 
number over the next decade. 
Telephone operators don't fare 
much better. In 1984, there were 
44,000 AT&amp;T operators handling 
37.5 million calls. In 1994. only 
15,000 operators handled 160 mil- 
lion calls. As for factory workers.

Thursday. May 18. 1 995 




ByPaulTupptr 
Fculures WJIor 

Leonardo DiCiprio, 20, will 
win an Oscar. Maybe noi this year. 
maybe noi ncxl, bul before his 
career is over, he will win (unless 
he leaves us ala River Phoenix). He 
was nominaied for flcsi Supporling 
Acior for "What's Eaiing Gilbert 
Grape," hul lost to Tommy Lee 
Jones for his role in "The Fugitive" 
in 1994. Why am 1 so sure of 
myself? Because I have just seen 
"The Baskeiball Diaries." 

DiCaprio's latest role is a bio- 
graphical piece about poet and 
musicLin Jim Cirroll. Once a rising 
basketball star. Carroll emerges 
from a drug habit to become one of 
today's most enduring writers. The 
movie is based on his rise and fall 

The movie siarLs with the less- 
than-^tellar group of four, includ- 
ing Carroll, on ihc rise lo basket- 
ball stardom while pestering any- 
one who gets in ihcir way. Stealing 
and fighting are hobbies of these 
sircei kids. Before long, drugs 
become pan of the fun. And to 
aecommodaic this new habit, steal- 
ing becomes a necessity. 

Carroll begins to heavily rely on 
drugs to make it llirough his day 
and has to use some desperate 
means, such as robbing an elderiy 
woman and male prostitution, lo 
gel drugs. During this time, his 
writing suiris lo suffer and his poet- 
ry takes a back seal to this new 
addiction. 

The four slowly break apart, 
with one focusing on his hoop 
dreams, one gelling caught robbing 
a candy shop, one murdering a 
drug pusher, and Carroll being 
arrested ouisidc of his mother's 
house for drug possession. 

DiCaprio is very cffecUve as a 
kid who's desperate, lonely, and 
not as in conu'ol as he may think. 
In one scene wiili underrated actor 
Ernie Hudson ("Ghostbuslers," 
"The Hand thai Rocks ihe 
Cradle"), DiCaprio pushes medicnJ 
acting 10 its outer limits as hi: 
pleads with Hudson to return ihe 
heroin found in his Jacket. 

The movie has several things 
working for ii. The first being the 
music soundtrack. Cuts from the 
Doors, PJ Harvey, and Jim Carroll 
himself (wiiti Pearl Jam) make up 
an entcrlaining CD and help the 
movie create effective emotions. 
The second is a strong supporting 
cast of Bruno Kirby, as the basket- 
ball coach, and Mark Wahlberg 
(yes, the alias Marky Mark), as 
Jim's best friend. Both of these 
actors bring their own pcrsonaiiUes 
to their characters. Kirby is sup- 
portive but wise, and Wahlberg is 
sireel smart and punkLsh. 

The picture's week spoi is 
Lorraine Bracco, cast as Jim 
Carroll's mother. Bracco is a credi- 
ble actress who should have done a 
good job with this role, but instead 
overacts in nearly every scene. 

If you, like me, are unfamiliar 
with Carroll's work, never fear. 
DiCaprio narrates the movie wiih 
poetry by Carroll, some of which is 
included on the soundtrack. 

This movie is wonh a look and I 
think it deserves a score of 7 out of 
a possible 10.

Who would have thought a Utile 
girl who sang backup for a 
Southern rap group would eveniu- 
ally iTLike a solo album as good as 
"Wild Seed - Wild Flower?" 
Dionnc Farris has beat the odds and 
made one of the mosi impressive 
debut albums of the nineiies. 

Known for her brief solo on 
"Tennessee" by Arrested 
Development, Farris decided to 
fool anyone ccpecting a simple 
R&amp;B album from her. What she 
offers on "Seed" is a diveree mix of 
gospel, rock, alternative, soul, and 
spirit. Unlike many black female 
artisis today, Farris doesn't use 
vocal gymnastics to create emo- 
tions. Not that she doesn't have ihe 
voice lo do so. She simply lets the 
lyrics express themselves. 

Love songs such as "I Know" do 
not overload ihc album. Mosi have 
a message or a story to tell. "Don't 
Ever Touch Me (Again)" is a lale 
about a woman who's obviously 



been raped ("Releasing the anger, 
the hurt, heartache and rage/ No 
more feeling like an animal stalked, 
trapped and caged"). 

Noi many people can pull off 
covering a Lcnnon and McCanney 
song. But Farris docs and does it 
well with "Blackbird." There is 
even a comedic, nonmusical piece 
at die close of the album wiih guest 



David Alan Gricr of "In L\\ 
Color" fame. 

Gricr is not die only friend that 
Farris has acquired for her debut. 
Mulii-ialcnied and undecapprcciai-

males, and nol just for sporting 
activities," 

"They (the kids) need to know 
that males are inicrcsied in education 
and creativity," said Skibinski. 

Those interested in environmental 
affairs might want lo get involved in 
events like tree-planting, recycling. 
and cleaning up the neighborhood. 

The wide variety of programs and 
the club environment afford a gn:ai 
deal of flexibility for those who want 
lo gel involved. 



Artist's work moving, yet scary 



By Megan McArdle 
Managing Editor 

Some paintings arc easy lo look 
at and ignore, while others have 
such an effect on you that you can't 
ignore ihcm. Dave Krousc's paint- 
ings, on exhibit at ArtLink until 
May 25, arc the latter. 

Krouse taught Art Appreciation 
and Craft and Design last semester 
at IPFW, 

All eight paintings arc striking 
alone, but even more so when seen 
as a whole. The characters are dom- 
inant, striking the viewer and hold- 
ing bis other aiieniion. 

Krouse uses the magician in 
many of his paintings. He said the 
magician is a meiaphtir for po'lili- 



Houses 



cians. who also peddle illusions. 

"The Levitaiion" is one of bis 
most striking paintings. The viewer 
is pulled in by the magician's 
expression much as volets are 
pulled in by politicians rhetoric. 
while the contrasting primary colors 
create conflict in the painting. 

The painting is scary, yet 
thrilling, 1 couldn't take my eyes 
off it, and even when 1 turned away 
I was compelled lo look at it again 
and again, each time noticing some 
new characterisiic. 

"The Shell Game" was another 
of Krousc's strong paintings. Again 
the magician is featured, this time 
he is tricking the viewer, seeming 
to move, though we know the 



LevitaHon 



image is still on the canvas. 

Although most of bis paintings 
have a similar look and feel, one 
stands out as being different, 
"Houses" features a man with a 
paint brush. The man just stands 
there. The painting is aesthetically 
pleasing and more subtle than some 
of his other works, 

Krousc's paintings are imptes- 
sivc and striking, but noi something 
I would want hanging on my wall, 

I think the show is worth seeing, 
if not because of the arresting quali- 
ty of Krousc's work dien because of 
their implications. 

In addition lo Krousc's painting, 
the work of several other area

New food service 
provider needed 



SiLKlcnu who arc on campus all 
day have lo cat here, They have 
three choices: bring food from 
home, buy food here, or buy food 
off campus. 

At present the only food avail- 
able Off campus is sold by the 
Canteen, either through the vending 
machines or at the Canteen itself. 

The Canteen's contract to pro- 
vide food service for the university 
comes up for renewal this year, 

We at The Communicator 
strongly urge the university to find 
an aliemaic provider for food ser- 
vice. 

The on-campus food service 
should provide students with good 
food at a reasonable price during 
the hours siudenu attend classes on 
campus. The Canteen docs not do 
Ibis. 

First of all, the Canteen is not 
open during all hours of class. 
Twenty-seven percent of IPFW's 
students take evening classes. 
Classes go on until 10:45 p.m. 

The only food service available 
aflcf 3:30 pjn. is dirough the vend- 
ing machines. The Canteen is sup- 
posed to stay open until 4 p.m. 
daily, but all the food is frequently 
put away by 3;30 p.m. and the gales 
are often closed and locked by 3:45 
pjn. 

By closing early the Canteen is 
not providing the services it has 
been contracted lo provide, and is 
leaving students who want to grab a 
bile between classes to try their 
luck with the vending machines. 

Most students would agree the 
food available from the vending 
machines is less than appetizing 



and often far from nutritious. 

As far as value is concerned, the 
Canteen is anydiing but a bargain. 
The prices are equivalent to what 
one would pay for a good meal at 
an area restaurant, but the food is 
not. 

The university could do much 
better by its students. Other univer- 
sities lea.se out space to fast food 
chains, or they at least have more 
than one food provider, with differ- 
ent providers open at different 
limes. 

Students on this campus would 
be much better served if at least 
some kind of hot food service was 
provided in the evening. Perhaps 
students would appreciate a grill 
which served hamburgers, French 
fries as well as hot soups or pre- 
prepared cold salads. 

Currently the university receives 
a percentage of the profits from the 
Canteen. The university demands 
such a high percentage that the 
choices for food service providers 
were severely limiied when they 
chose die Canteen. 

If die quality of food available 
on campus improved more students 
would cat here, generating more 
profit, then the university wouldn't 
need to Like such a large cut. 

What is the university's incen- 
tive anyway? Shouldn't their goal 
to be to provide quality food for the 
siudents at a reasonable price, and 
not lo just make money? Students 
here deserve better, and it is the 
university's responsibility to find a 
food service provider that will give 
tlicm something belter.

Sexually active gays should not donate blood 



Gay Day at King's Island 
comforting to homosexuals 



June 4 is Gay Day at King's 
Island. Although the park itself 
does not sponsor the event, the 
workers and the management arc 
very supponive of the crowd which 
Gay Day draws. Anyone who 
thinks gays are a minuscule pan of 
society should go to witness the 
bonding of a community. 

The first year I went, I was 

twenty years old and a new member 

of the gay 



■■^■■■^■i 


community. 


V^ 


Although I 


W^ ■ 


knew I was 


Po^l 


gay for many 






1L^ A 


then. I was just 


■^ 1 


now getting 


^v \ 


out and seeing 




that being gay 






Paul 


the sexual acl.s 


Tupper 


committed that 







ety uses to define the homosexual. 
Nothing could have prepared me 
for what I was about to experience. 

Upon entering, I was surrounded 
by thousands of gays. lesbians and 
biscxuals, all holding hands and 
being openly afteciionate with one 
another. One lesbian couple caught 
me staring at this normally taboo 
behavior and flashed me a comfort- 
ing and welcoming smile. "This is 
it," I thought to myself, "This is 
what I have waited for and wanted 
all my life!" 

It wasn't just die open expres- 
sions of love that took my breath 
away, but the number of children 
who accompanied the same sex 
couples to the park. I couldn't help 
but wonder what these young tikes 



were thinking. I was sure that diey 
were used to seeing their "parents" 
together at home, but now in public 
daddy and daddy were hand in 
hand, smooching in line for the 
Beast. 

Once the shock of seeing so 
many gay people settled, I began to 
realize that there were heterosexu- 
als at the park as well, with iheir 
children, I overheard one litUe girl 
ask her mother why two men were 
kissing. She correctly responded, 
"Because some people are different, 
dear." 

I was expecting more trouble 
from the heterosexuals there. The 
one near fight 1 witnessed occurred 
when a straight said that he couldn't 
believe die amount of gays present 
(of course be was using odier lan- 
guage), only to find himself sur- 
rounded by nearly diiriy gays ready 
to stand up for their right to be 
dicre. End of situation. 

1 left ECings Island feeling like I 
was a pan of something bigger than 
life. Before I was in what 1 believed 
to be a suburb of life, now 1 saw 
myself as a member of a whole 
state. Gaydiana. Queerlifornia. 
Nonh Pinkoda. 

For those of you who wish to be 
apart of the celebration, here arc a 
few tip.s. Wear red, that's how die 
other gays distinguish you (not like 
they couldn't tell anyway). Go with 
a big group of friends, lo celebrate 
together. And go the night before 
and stay in a hotel. Tlie long drive 
to King's Island may dampen your 
cndiusiasm. 

Opinions in this column do not 
necessarily represent the opin- 
ions ot The Communicator. 



I read Paul Tupper's column 
regularly and rarely do 1 allow it 
to elevate my blood pressure. 
Although 1 personally find his 
lifestyle choice disgusting and 
reprehensible, I support and 
defend his First Amendment right 
lo air his opinion. However, when 
he inappropriately stated that he 
could give blood lo help people, I 
felt a duty to our campus to 
inform him of an important fact. 

When completing the Red 
Cross screening, specific ques- 
tions are asked as to any homo- 
sexual activity since 1977, Unless 
he has been saving himself for 



Mr. Right, he is ineligible to 
donate blood. This supposition 
takes for granted that he would 
answer the screening questions 
trtithfully. Surely a man of his 
high moral standing would not 
falsify a document. 

Before he begins preaching 
about the homophobic, gay-bash- 
ing, right-wing Red Cross, allow 
me to say that Uiis screening poli- 
cy is in effect to keep people with 
possibly lainted blood or mem- 
bers of high risk group for blood- 
borne diseases from contaminat- 
ing the public's blood supply. 
Many people who never used IV 



drugs or have promiscuous or 
homosexual sex have died 
because of someone else's 
immorality. 

As a regular blood donor, and 
someone who cares about ihe 
public safety, yes even Paul's, 1 
wanted lo remind him of Ihe regu- 
lations that are in place to protect 
people from the threat of AIDS 
and reinind the staff and students 
of IPFW who donate blood regu- 
larly if they are eligible. 

Paul, may your day be happy 
and, gay.,

Turn signals 
rarely used 
correctly 

It has come lo my atlcntfon 
lately that the general public can 
not use their turn signals. If you 
by chance actually use your turn 
signal, then this does not apply 
10 you. But for those of you who 
do not use your turn signal, 
please con- 
tinue read- 
ing. 

■"■'■ I 'h;ave 
thought'a lot 



Universities must change to fit the 
needs of students (today) 




abo&lt; 



this 



As a professional educator, the 
reform of cduealion concerns me. 
Teacher leadership is probably one 
of the essentials to restructure 
schools for the twenty-first century. 
Meeting the needs of every student 
while mainuiining a learning envi- 
ronment is another goal in creating 
schools that .ire learner-centered. 

But what about educational 
reform at the university level? As 
we approach the twenty-first centu- 
ry, we must meet the needs of every 
student at Ihe university level as 
well. Particularly die graduate stu- 
dents who are faced with many 
responsibilities including work, 
family, home, and community. The 
institutions of higher learning must 



use appropriate ways of teaching 
and learning. Students should be 
allowed to work in cooperative 
learning situations. Professors 
should be encouraged to implement 
styles that help students to constnict 
and solve problems crcadng mean- 
ingful and useful ways of a.ssessing 
students' progress other than 
midterms and final exams. 

Educators of the twenty-first 
century will use different instruc- 
tional practices and assessment 
tools. Students should not have to 
waste time preparing and worrying 
about test situations. Instead, stu- 
dents should be involved in solving 
problems, finding resources, evalu- 
ating evidence, and presenting and 



defending their work or views to 
their peers. Universities might con- 
sider educational reform in allow- 
ing students to do projects, exhibi- 
tions, debates, inquiries, and peer 
and self-evaluations. Students 
should be assessed un die progress 
diey make and how they may apply 
information ihey have learned lo 
their professions. 

As an active participant in edu- 
cational reform, it is my hope that 
instructors at every educational 
level will re-&lt;valuaie using tests as 
the only means for assessmenL

subject and 
have decided 
there are two 
kinds of turn 
signal abuse: 
Ihe person 

who never 

uses the turn signal and makes 
sharp, sudden turns and freaks 
out the driver behind them; and 
the person who uses their turn 
signal too much. i.e. llie person 
who has their turn signal on for 
a half hour and never turns and 
brakes a lot. 

Person number one should 
be shot. When one does not use 
their turn signal. Ihey are not 
only endangering ail surround- 
ing drivers, but also themselves. 
If you can not use your lum sig- 
nal then go home and do nol 
come out until you know how to 
use your turn signal. 

Person number two should be 
shol as well. 1 am happy thai 
you know how to use your lurn 
signal, but please people, at 
least know when to use your 
turn signal. I am so sick of those 
morons who drive along and 
have Iheir hjrn signal on for four 
or five blocks, slam on ihe 
brakes often and ihen never 
turn. Now I understand if you 
do not know where you are or 
where you are going, but at least 
have the counesy lo stop using 
your turn signal for long periods 
of time. 

This world would be a much 
belter place if everyone jusi did 
the correct thing and used Iheir 
lurn signal at the right time. If 
you can not understand this con- 
cept maybe you should consider 
some other options until you do. 
For example, read the driver's 
manual again; lake the bus; or 
call a friend who knows how 
and when to use their turn sig- 
nal. 

But above all, be safe and 
know what you are doing when 
you are driving. Happy driving.

The IPFW men's lennis leam 
ended its season on April 28 and 29 
with a third-place finish at die Great 
Lakes Valley Conference tourna- 
ment at the Rolex Tennis Center at 
Indianapolis. 
The

Jason Garrioiie won die number

Kentucky University in straight sets 
in the championship match. 
Garriotte defeated Ihe number one 
seed from Indianapolis, 6-4. 6-2, in 
the semifinals, 

"Number one singles is a crap 
shoot," IPFW coach Dan Brogan 
said, "Four or five people could 
have won it ... the most impressive 
thing was, he beat the two-time 
defending champion." 

Mastodon Scott Miller won the 
number two singles title over B.J. 
Hall of Bcllarmine College for his

Brogan said, "1 think he would havi.' 
had a good chance to win." 

Shane Crager was die Masiodons' 
number three player until he quit 
before the tournament started; 
Crager was undefeated when he 
quit. 

The numbers four, five and six 



singles did not advance beyond ihL- 
first round, scoring no points in the 
Mastodons' tournament effort. 

"TTiird place was a really stronv- 
showing," Brogan said, "for four, 
five and six not scoring." 

The number one doubles team of 
Miller and D.ivid Krahn lost in die 
final of dieir tournament. The num- 
ber two leam of Garriotte and 
Darrin Strayer lost their first-round 
match in diree sets. 

The number three doubles team 
of Simmons and Chris Shidler fell 
to eventual champion Bcllarmine 
College's three doubles team, 6-2, 
7-5, in the semifinals. Brogan said 
IPFW would have placed second if 
Simmons and Shidler had won dieir 
match; only one point separated 
IPI^V and BC at the tournament's 
finish. 

Indianapolis followed ils regular- 
season GLVC thlc with die tourna- 
ment championship and Bcllarmine

luring jobs have been cul since 

1980. 

Other positions in decline 
inclutle newspaper rcponers. corpo- 
rate middle managers, farmers. 
govcrnmeni bureaucrats, specially 
physicians, corporate lawyers and 
maihemaiicians. 

Where are all the jobs going? 
According to P.O.V.. the technolog- 
ical, informational and health care 
industries are die growing Tields of 
Ihi; future. Multimedia software 
designer is the number one job for 
the 21st century. These design jobs 
have grown 40 percent in 10 years. 
There are still only 30.000 multi- 
media software designers working 
today with a potential salary of 
more than SIOO.OOO. 

Management consultants have 
had a 35 percent job growth rate 
while interactive advertising execu- 
tive positions have increased 400 
percent. Other positions on the rise 
include Internet surfer, nurse pracii- 
lioncr, physical dierapisi, industrial 
environmentalist, emerging mari&lt;ets 
trader, cyber detective and funeral 
director. 

The evolution of employment 
continues, and nothing is left 
untouched. Even the spaces in 
which we work and the fundamen- 
tals of how we work will change, 
altering the way business does busi- 
ness. Finding new organizational 
models for business will be a high 
priority. 

The future is now as one pro- 
gressive advertising agency is Los 
Angeles has created the idea of a 
virtual office. The idea came to 
Chiat/Day's chairman Jay Chiai a 
couple of years ago. 

"1 just thought about the way I 
iuirkcd, and I checked out the way 
other people were working, ll 
niaiJe no sense." said Chiai. "I'd 
come in the morning and I'd turn 
on my powcrbook or whatever in 
my workspace, and I had all this 
clutter that 1 jusl kept moving 
around, rcstacking and throwing 
out. My pffice had become an 
archaic space that I used to just 
store all my stuff, very little of 
which hnd to do with what I do." 

For Cliiai, productive work is 
loosing onto ihc network, reading 
."inJ sending E-mail, returning calls 
aiikl dien going to a meeting, often 
oui of the office widi a client. For 
iiim, work is a service you perform. 
Mill a place you drive to in the 
ling. 

So Chiat created the virtual 
office. There would no longer be 
any personal offices, cubicles or 
desks. Like a library book, employ- 



ees would check out portable 
phones and computers from dis- 
pensers known as the Cage and die 
Concierge, dien sit down at the First 
available work sDtion and work. 

Chiai's eitperiment began in 
January 1994 with the results yet to 
be seen, but the focus of finding 
new and innovative ways to man- 
age business is in full stride. 
■'Really, we're just at die beginning 
of finding new organizational mod- 
els for business." says Bob 
Schmetter of the advertising agency 
Messner. Veterc. Bergcr, 
McNamee, Schmeitcr/Euro RSCG. 
"The old way w.is the chain-of- 
command model derived from the 
military, a pyramidal structure with 
one guy on top. Today we're less 
hierarchical. Clients always get to 
deal with a top person that way. 
Undemeadi is a very flat organiza- 
tion, no more than two deep, as 
opposed to seven or eight layers in 
the old system." 

The shamrock model is anodier 
example of a new organizational 
concept, in which a company con- 
sists of a core of permanent 
employees surrounded by a crop of 
part-timers or freelancers. "The 
shamrock allows you to adjust for 
work flow with new projects but 
also avoids mass layoffs." says 
Schmetter 

According to Time magazine 3 
million employees of U.S. compa- 
nies already telecommute. That is 
they perform all or part of their 
employment duties away from die 
office by using faxes, e-mail, tele- 
phones and other technology. The 
number is also expected to inaease 
about 20 percent every year due to 
more user-friendly technology 
designed specifically for mobile 
employees. 

As die future of business move;; 
forward and you add up all die drug 
screens, background checks, multi- 
media software designers, industrial 
environmentalists, virtual offices 
and shamrocks, the dehumanizing 
factors can be overwhelming. The 
loss of private space, wavering 
employee loyalty, the lack of face- 
to-face communication and 
increased or intensified work hours 
all have an cfl'ect on the morale and 
productivity of the employee. The 
human condition seems to have 
been left out in the cold of cyber- 
space. And one of the deepest con- 
cerns of die labor movement for the 
2Isi century is its own existence. 
Difficult psychological and social 
adjustment), will have to be made in 
order to survive.
